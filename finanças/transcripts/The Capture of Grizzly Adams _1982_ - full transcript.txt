(slow, mournful melody playing) ♪♪ ♪♪ Well, folks, we... we come now to the sad and sorry business of... burying this here good woman, Cora Adams-- a protector and a guardian to her - (Peg sniffles) - young niece Peg there, and... well, just about the best neighbor that us folks ever had. I wish we had us a real preacher to read over her, but, well, we ain't, so, uh... well, take off your hats. Come on, take off your hat. Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for Thou art with me. Thy rod and Thy staff-- they comfort me. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Amen. ALL: Amen. - Amen. - (Peg cries quietly) Well, might as well go ahead and finish up here. (Peg sighs) Miss Brady, I want to stay with you. Please, Miss Brady. Please, can I? MISS BRADY: Sheriff, would it be all right? I can't do that, Miss Kate. Her pa's got charges against him, and the law says that she has to stay in my care till the orphan's home comes to claim her. Now, darling Peg, y-you come and stay with us, and I'll keep you well and warm, and you can see Miss Kate any time you want to. Come on, darling. You know this'll bring him down out of those mountains. Maybe so, Frank. But if Adams does show up, I'll catch him, and I'll see him tried for the murder that's been said against him. He killed my partner. I want him to pay. Trial or no trial. You all understand that? Well, I finally got this fish trap all set up for you, Mrs. Thompkins. Now all we got to do is just get Ezra to check it every morning and every night. You're a good neighbor, Mr. Adams. Well, I know it's not too much to look at, but I guarantee you it's gonna catch you a few meals. YOUNG MAN: Ma?! Ma! Down here at the crick, Ezra! There's a fire. Which way is it headed, Ezra? Wind's headed up ridge, other side of the river. Your place is all right, Mr. Adams. Oh, thank goodness. But I spotted old Bert Woolman. - Where'd you see Bert? - Maybe a mile off. I don't think he could see the fire where he was, Mr. Adams. He was going right to it. I tried hollering, but he couldn't hear. He's right between the fire and the river on the other side of Barker's Point. I'll tell you, if Bert gets caught in between that fire and that river, you know he can't swim the lake. - I better go with you. - I want you to stay here. In case that wind changes, your mom's gonna need your help. Well, you take Ezra's horse, Mr. Adams. Thank you, ma'am. Ben, you stay here. (Ben bellows) (whines, groans) - (donkey brays) - Easy, Stanley. Come on now. Once we get across that river, we won't have to worry about them kegs of powder no more. This way, come on. (Stanley braying, Bert coughing) (screeching) (squeaking) (coughing) (chittering) (Stanley braying, Bert coughing) (Stanley wheezes) (Stanley chuffing) (Stanley wheezes) (Bert grunting) (Stanley braying) There it is, Stanley, right where I told you. Come on, come on, come on. Whoa! Come on now. We got to get out of here, somebody's gonna wind up with fried burro for dinner. Bert! Adams! There's not much time! (Stanley grunts) Hold still now, Stanley. Let's get this powder keg off'n you. Adams, haul away! Hang on, Bert. Hold tight. I got you! (Stanley brays softly) (metallic creaking) (creaking continues) Adams! Faster! Faster! (grunts) (creaking) (tree creaking) Jump, Stanley, jump! (grunting) (gasps) No! Bert, jump off that thing! Get off of it! ♪♪ (braying) (grunts) (Adams grunting with effort) (groans) (panting) (braying) He's alive! - (Stanley grunts) - He's hurt some, but he's alive. (panting) Well, there's nothing broke up inside him as far as I can see, Mr. Adams. But he sure has a nasty cut on his head. He shouldn't be moved. Well, I'm sure obliged to you, Mrs. Thompkins. Thank you, ma'am. (weakly): Adams... Oh, take it easy now, Bert. I was coming to see you. - It's about your sister. - What's wrong with her? She come down with lung fever. Cora? James... she's dead. Happened last week. She went real quick. Where's Peg? Well, now, she's up to the sheriffs house and... well, he's looking after her till the stage gets her, then he's shipping her off to the orphan farm. I've got to go get her. Now, don't you go after that girl. The sheriff'll get you for sure. I got to take that chance, Belt. Son, you need me. No, you wouldn't be any good to me or anybody till you get yourself mended. Doggone stubborn fool. (door closes) He's just gonna stand no chance at all... (sighs): without me. Ben? - (bellowing) - Come on, Ben. (bellowing) May God go with you. (Ben bellows) Wait here, Ben. (Ben bellows, grunts) Don't you think you're overreacting to all of this? Adams killed once. There ain't no reason to think he wouldn't do it again. All right, all right. I'll... I'll leave Hank and Jud here to cover the jail. We'll go deputize your men. Come on. Over here. (whispers): Let's go, let's go. ♪♪ - Pa! - Shh. - Oh, Pa. - Ah, honey. I knew you'd come for me, Pa. That's been the trouble-- everybody knew I'd come looking for you. Now, what we got to do is figure out how to get out of here without getting caught. (whispers): Why don't you get your dress on. (window slides open) (crickets chirping) (dog barking in distance) MAN: Adams! Adams! Hold it right there! - (Adams groans) - Pa! Pa! - Pa! - It's okay. Come on, come on. Pa... Jud! Get me untied! - You all right? - Yeah. You see Adams? Aw, he got away with the girl. Come on, let's go. Sheriff! Sheriff! Adams's been here. He's got the girl. I got a shot away, but he slipped off in the dark. All right, you men, spread out and don't let him get past you. Let's get back to the house and see if we can pick up his trail! Let's stop, honey. (groaning in pain) - You okay, Pa? - (Adams panting) I'll be okay. I got to... stop the bleeding. Don't you worry, princess. We're gonna make it. I just got to rest for a minute, honey. (Adams groaning) HANK: He's carrying a rifle, so be careful. This way, Sheriff. Pa, Pa, please get up. SHERIFF: Let's split up. You men check over there. - HANK: Any trace of him, Jud? - Nothing over here. Pa, please, I can hear 'em! (rustling nearby, indistinct voices) MAN (whispers): Let's go. All right, you two check that side of the thicket. Matt, come on. Hey, there's some tracks over here. Come on... keep your guns ready, just in case. (twig snaps) Oh, Miss Brady, I thought you were one of them. Shh. I heard all the shouting. What's happened? It's my father. How badly is he hurt? He's been shot... in the leg. Mr. Adams, do you think you could walk? - My place is close by. - (Adams grunts) Peg, you go ahead and see if the way is clear, but be careful, all right? (Adams grunting) You can come now. Hurry. (Adams panting) MAN: Sheriff, why did you call off the search? We know he's out there. We ain't gonna pick up his trail now; it's too dark! Come morning, we can see what we're doing. By morning, Adams will have a ten-hour start. How far do you think he's gonna get with a girl child to care for? JUD: Sheriff! Sheriff! It's blood! Fresh blood. Where'd you find this? Over in the grove. That shot you got off must've hit him. Sheriff, he's got to be somewhere in town. Well, let's just go dig him out. MAN 2: Let's check this side of the street. You did just fine, Peg. You're a brave girl. I'm awful proud of you, sweetheart. Now, rinse these out on the porch and empty the water, all right? All right. (cat meowing) KATE: Get down, Peaches. Go on. Get down. (Peaches meowing) I sure appreciate all your help. You really are taking quite a chance. Well, I, um... I feel I've come to know you well through Peg. And not just from her memories and the stories of you, but... ...from the sort of person she's become. She's kind and she's gentle, and it's... it's easy to see she got those qualities from you. Can you see that, really? Yes. (laughs softly) I hadn't lived here long before you left, but... I have my own memories of the sort of man you were. You haven't changed. My only regret is that... I brought my problems down on you and... I think they're gonna paint you with the same brush for helping me. No matter what's been said, I'll never believe you killed that man. (sighs) PEG: Miss Brady. There's men on the street and they're coming this way. They're stopping at every house. All right, uh, both of you up in the loft. Right now. - (whispers): Hurry up. - SHERIFF (muffled): Kate? - (pounding on door) - MAN: Come on, open up. SHERIFF: Kate, are you in there? It's Sheriff Hawkins. Please open up! (knocking insistently) Uh, I'll be right with you, Sheriff. What right...? Sheriff, this man has no right in my house. We're looking for that fella Adams and his daughter. Now, maybe you've seen them. KATE: No, I haven't. We're searching every place. Well, they're not here. Then there's no problem for us to look around. I said they're not here. We'll just check to make sure. (wood creaking) Well, well, well... what do you know. All right, Adams... don't try anything. - (meows, yowls) - Aah! KATE: And you're hunting a man who keeps a grizzly bear for a friend? Why, you can't even manage my cat. You know something. Maybe I ought to just shake it out of you. Briggs! You ain't gonna need that, Miss Kate-- now, put it down. - (distant gunshots) - HANK: There he goes! HANK: Come on! This way! Jud! Jud! What's going on? Hank was tracking some bear prints before. Maybe he come on something. If that's Adams' bear, he can't be far away. Let's go. Mr. Adams, they've gone. I think they saw Ben. Well, we don't have to worry about ol' Ben. He can take care of himself. But Briggs, he'll know that we're still here. We're gonna have to be moving on. Well, I... I hid your things in the smokehouse. But I... I don't want you to go. It'll be safer if we travel at night, and anyway, they'll probably be following Ben's trail. Will you just keep going, both of you? Well, I figures when my leg got better, Peg and I'd head on out to California, maybe get us a fresh start. Anyway, Peg's the only reason I stayed around this long. Will I ever see you again? I hope so, ma'am. Maybe in a better time and a better place. Miss Brady, I'm gonna miss you. I'll miss you, too. Come on, princess. God bless you, ma'am, for everything. All right. - BERT: Oh, phew! - Hm? Almost finished. Any more of your soup and I will be finished. Looks like you're feeling better this morning. The only chance a fella has to escape around here is to hurry up and start mendin'. Oh, your oneriness is back, which is good, I guess. But you still feel pain in that head wound, and you can't fool me on that account. Don't you understand, I just got to light out after Adams. There's no telling what kind of trouble he's gonna get into in the town there, all by himself. Bert, you're better, but you still couldn't make it halfway to town in your condition. Ma... I could go. I mean, I'd like to do something to help out. You ride into town just as fast as you can. Just see what's going on. First sign of trouble you ride back here and tell me, you understand? Yes, sir. Swallow. (groans, grumbles) Good morning, princess. Morning, Pa. (Adams grunts) I brought you a little breakfast. I know it's not too much to look at, but I've been saving a surprise for us-- a little beef jerky. (chuckles) (groans) How's your leg this morning? Honey, I've felt worse. I tell you, that Kate, she's a pretty good doctor. - She likes you; I could tell. - Aw. (twigs snapping) Shh. (grunting) Ben, you just about scared us to death. - (Ben bellows) - (Adams chuckles) (Ben groans) PEG: He's beautiful. How'd you and him get to be friends? Ben was just a little cub when I found him. He was caught on this ledge. I climbed down and got him and... I bottle-fed him. Before I knew it, he started thinking I was him mom. I reckon he's big enough to know the difference now. (grunts softly) (chuckles) I want you to do me a favor, princess. I want you to sit right here and be as quiet as a church mouse, all right? Where you gonna be? I got to go do a little scouting around, see if they're closing in on us or if we can make a run for it. I'll leave Ben here with you, all right? I love you.

You ever see what a wounded grizzly can do? Hank! Get after him. Whaley, go with him. I'm sorry, Pa. At least we had a little time together. (dog barking) Sheriff, is all this really necessary? Mr. Adams already had a leg wound. Well, he tried to get away before. I figured if he got the chance, he might try it again. It's all right, ma'am. He's just doin' his job. There ain't nothing personal in any of this, Adams. You're wanted for murder, it's my job to see you're tried for it. Oh, Pa, I don't want to leave you. Can I stay with my pa tonight? Please, Mr. Hawkins? Oh, uh... That wouldn't be fittin', not in no jail cell. Come along, darling. Come with me. I'm so sorry. Thank you, Liz. Pa, I love you so much. I love you, princess. Lock him up. James... don't lose hope. I won't, ma'am. I just don't know any other thing to say but "thank you" and-and that surely isn't enough. Thank you, ma'am. I can't believe you've allowed yourself to become a part of all of this. Part of all of what? You and Frank Briggs used that little girl like bait in a trap. You knew James Adams wouldn't let his child be sent off to an orphan farm. Oh, now look, he's wanted for murder. He come down here and he was caught. That's the law. And what kind of a trial do you think he'll get in this town? Frank Briggs owns most of the people here. Well, he'll get a fair trial, I'll tell you that. I'll see to it! He'll get a fair trial! I want to see justice done. So do we all, Miss Kate. Do you? (door opens) (door shuts) (sighs) (rooster crows) WHALEY: What do you think? HANK: It's a fresh track all right, real fresh. Come on.

How are you? - Nice to see you, Walter. - Nice to see you, Mr. Briggs. - Get that sluice box built yet? - No, still working on it. ♪♪ (sighs) (gavel banging) Well, we may not have a regular judge and we may not have a regular courtroom or the trappings that go with it, but we are going to have an honest trial done according to the law. Now, anyone who wants to say anything is gonna have to prove it's true on this here Bible. And, for or against, you're all gonna get your turn, and the jury will decide. Mr. Briggs here is the accuser. He's gonna be calling on some of you to serve as witnesses. Mr. Adams here, he's doing his own lawyerin'. Now, you fellas in the jury, I want you to hear me good. I want you to listen to everything that's said or heard, and I want you to come in with the truth just as close as you can come to it. Now, if you say that Adams is guilty of murder, then he'll hang. But if you say he's innocent, I'll let him go. That's all there is to it. (low, indistinct chatter) All right, quiet. Quiet, now! Quiet! You have a statement, Mr. Briggs? Well, gentlemen, the long and short of it is, uh, when me and Pete Ferguson partnered up for the B and F Land Company, and got the water rights to that 30 sections north of Willawa... Adams turned bad. He argued and fought with Ferguson all the time, about paying fare for the water and grazing. It built up between 'em... until the night Adams... took a hammer to old Pete in his blacksmith shop... and done him in. I was witness to it. (townsfolk murmuring) (gavel banging) Adams... is there anything you wanted to say to that? Yes, Sheriff, there is. Ladies and gentlemen... ...I did not kill Peter Ferguson. I've never killed a man in my life. I don't know if I can prove it to you... ...but I'm sure gonna try. SHERIFF HAWKINS: All right, Mr. Briggs, start calling your witnesses. Well, look, uh, I can't say it was Adams himself that started the barn fire at Ferguson ranch, but he sure wasn't sad about it. I remember that. All us farmers in the north end of the valley had a grudge against Ferguson over the water rights. But Adams, well, I'd never seen him quite so worked up as he was. He said it wasn't right what Ferguson was doing. He said he was gonna square things. You wouldn't call yourself a friend of Ferguson's, would you? I would not. How about Adams? Adams was a good neighbor and... a good man. But you saw that good neighbor and good man attack Ferguson in town one day, didn't you? Ferguson was beating a poor old horse nearly to death with a whip... just because the horse was... was getting nervous about getting shod. What did Adams do? Well, everybody knows how... how Adams was about... about animals. He grabbed the whip away from Ferguson. Ferguson tried to hit him with an iron bar. Well, Adams took it away from him, threw him on the ground, and put his foot on top of Ferguson's chest so he couldn't get up. What did Adams say right then? He told Ferguson if he ever caught him beating an animal again, he'd do the same to him. (murmuring) Any questions, Adams? How's the family, Mr. O'Laughlin? Good. All those years that we were neighbors, do you ever remember anybody saying that I had a bad temper or that I was cruel? They said just the opposite. You're a kind, gentle man. Do you really think that I threatened to kill Ferguson that day in the street? You only said you'd whip him good. That's what you meant. That's all, Michael. Wait, there's one other thing. When the B and F Land Company cut the water rights off to your place and mine, and all the others, was I the only one that had angry words for Ferguson? No, no. No, sir. Everyone did. More than 30 of us were left without water. And the way Ferguson handled things, he made a lot of enemies out of it. That's all, Michael. Thank you. Mr. Briggs, you got any more witnesses, let's get 'em heard, huh? Just one more, Sheriff. Tom Quigley. Tom... will you come down here and tell 'em what you saw with your own two eyes? Me and my boy... Daniel... well, we had... we'd just been in town for a couple of days. His ma had been dead for more than a year, and, uh, I was stone broke and without work. Mr. Ferguson allowed me and Daniel to, um... bunk out in the-the hay shed out behind the blacksmith shop. I was just getting ready to tuck me and Daniel in for the night when I heard a terrible argument coming from the inside. Mr. Ferguson and... and somebody that I didn't know, they was having mighty angry words. Well, I come out and I went to the back door to, uh, to have a look. And the men, they was, uh, scuffling with each other and wrestling and... and cursing and calling names. It was dark inside, so... I couldn't rightly say who the other man was. I mean, I was new in town, and I... and I didn't have a friend here, you understand. Anyway... whatever the argument was, it wasn't any of my business, so, uh... I just slipped on back. In just a couple of seconds, I heard the awful sound of somebody being hit. I heard a man cry out, and then... the sound of the fighting... stopped. When I went back to have a look... I saw a man standing over Ferguson's body with a hammer in his hand. Is that man in this room? He's right over there. BRIGGS: James Capen Adams? Yes. (townsfolk murmuring) Adams, you got anything you want to ask Tom here? Tom, I remember the night you're talking about very well. It was the tenth of September, very warm for that time of year. I suppose you remember how the moon was set that night and how many horses were tied up on Main Street. (laughter) I do remember it was the last time I saw my daughter and my friends, Mr. Briggs. There hasn't been a day gone by these last few years I haven't tried to figure out what went on that night. Over and over, I run it around in my mind, trying to make sense of it. I heard the argument and the angry words you're talking about, Tom. The same as you. I was walking down the street and went straight for the smithy's. I couldn't have got there more than a minute after Ferguson had been hit. (horse neighs quietly) (townsfolk chattering) (man speaks quietly, indistinctly) (horse neighs, townsfolk murmur) What you doing, Adams? Nothing. I heard an argument in here, I came in to see what was going on, and I found him just like this. You killed him. No! I did not kill him! You can't put this off on me, Briggs. I didn't do it! - Come back here! - (townsfolk shouting) SHERIFF: Let's get on with it, Adams. You got any questions for the witness? Mr. Quigley, you work for Briggs? Well, I guess everybody around here knows that I'm the foreman of his ranch. Earlier you said, when you come to town, you had no money and no job. How soon after Ferguson's death did you go to work for Briggs? Directly after. Would you say that Mr. Briggs is a rich man? What's that got to do with this trial? Just answer the question, Tom. Well, I-I'd say he probably has more than most. ADAMS: Are you telling me the truth about what you saw that night? Everything I've said here is the God's truth. But are you telling me everything? I don't get what you're driving at, Adams. Somebody killed Peter Ferguson that night, Sheriff, but it wasn't me. After Ferguson's death, Mr. Briggs became a very rich man. Do we have to listen to this?! Whoever killed Ferguson that night had to run out the back way, right past Tom Quigley. Now, maybe Mr. Quigley doesn't want to say who that was because he's beholden to that man-- you, Mr. Briggs, being that man. - (townsfolk murmuring) - You killed Peter Ferguson, then laid the blame on me. Sheriff, he's the one on trial here, not me! All right, Adams. All you're doing is raising a lot of suspicion. Then, Sheriff, you ask Tom Quigley who ran past him that night in the smithy. I'll do it for you, Sheriff. Tom, did you see anybody run out the back door of the smithy the night of the murder? - Well, did you?! - No, I didn't. There you are, Adams! You didn't see anybody run out the front door, and Tom didn't see nobody run out the back door 'cause there weren't nobody there. You were the only one in there with Peter Ferguson, and you killed him. (townsfolk murmuring) (townsfolk conversing indistinctly) SHERIFF HAWKINS: You can step down, Tom. You folks in the jury, the time has come for you to decide. It's come down to a choice between the word of Frank Briggs and Tom Quigley against that of James Adams. Now we know a man was killed here. These are the facts as good as we can have them. It's up to you to decide. (men conversing quietly) (quietly): Uh... We, in the jury, based upon the testimony presented before us, find James Capen Adams... guilty. (clamoring) (gavel banging) (clamor continues) (horse sputters) Sheriff? Sheriff! WHALEY: Well, we got it, Sheriff. Whoa. Here's Adams' grizzly bear. Or what's left of it. (Adams cries) Oh, no. (Adams cries) (horse neighing) Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Miss Kate. What are you doing out this late? Trying to prevent a horrible miscarriage of justice. Something no man in this town has the courage to do, it seems. Excuse me. (sighs) Thank you, Mrs. Conway. And if you could just try to persuade your husband, I know he'd feel the better for it. Well... I don't know if it will do any good, but, uh, maybe if he sees Liz Hawkins standing there, he'll come over. Well, I'm going to talk to her right now. - Good night. - Good night. Well, Kate, come on in. Is Liz still up? I'd like a moment with her. She's up. I doubt if she'll sleep tonight. Here, I'll take that for you. Thank you. KATE: Liz? Kate. How's Peg? Doc Eustace gave her a tonic to help her sleep. Poor little girl. First her Aunt Cora, now this. Yes. I'll, um... I'll-I'll make us some tea. No. No, thank you. Uh, Liz, I need to talk to you. I've been going from house to house speaking to anyone who would listen. You're a fool, Kate. There's nothing more you can do, nothing at all. Well, I can't believe that. I won't believe that. This is a civilized town of God-fearing, law-abiding people. We wouldn't hang an innocent man. We couldn't, Liz. Kate, James Adams has been found guilty by the jury. In the eyes of the law, he is a convicted murderer. You don't believe that, Liz. Not you. (wry laugh) You don't have to prove anything to me, Kate. There never was a time I believed that James Adams ever killed anybody. Not six years ago, and not now. Then help him. Help me, help that little girl. LIZ: How? What can I do? Be there, at that hanging tree, before dawn. More than 20 women have said they would be there. Join hands with us around that tree. Oh, Kate. Look, even if we kept them from hanging James Adams in the morning, we can't stand around that tree holding hands forever. But if we could stop the hanging for just a few hours, maybe the whole town would have time to come to its senses. Maybe the people would rise up and refuse to take part in the murder of an innocent man. There has never, ever been a time when I have put myself between my Mr. Hawkins and his duty as sheriff. And I don't know as I could start now. Do you really believe it's the sheriffs duty to hang a man we all know is innocent? I'll think about it, Kate. That's all I can give you. But you're not going out in the night again? There's more people to talk to. (door opening) (rooster crows) Elizabeth, you-you didn't come to bed at all last night. There isn't a person in this town with a conscience who could have slept last night. Well, I didn't convict Adams. All the years that we've been married, I've always been proud... ...until now. Oh, now, wait a minute, Elizabeth... wait... listen, I want to tell you something, Elizabeth. You don't understand what I'm trying to do. Elizabeth! (distant): Elizabeth! (wind gusting, whooshing) Mr. Briggs? Mr. Briggs? The Wind's knocked down four sections of fence below the ridge! We got more than a hundred head of cattle in the woods out there! All right, you heard him! Back to the ranch! Let's get this done before the hanging. MAN: Let's go. Come on. - Hyah! Hyah! - (horse neighing) - Hyah! - Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! PEG: Pa? My baby. Let me look at you, princess. You're a pretty girl. (Peg sniffles) You gotta go. (crying): I can't do it, Pa. You promised me. (sniffling) But... how can I say good-bye to you... like you were just going off somewhere, instead of...? (crying) We did it once before, didn't we? You said good-bye to me, gave me a big kiss, didn't you? But I knew that you were alive and that you'd come back to me someday. I want you to go out into the morning. I want you to walk right by those people. And you go out into the woods, like we talked about, all right? Wait till this is all over. I'll come to you.

And when and if this town ever pulls itself back... together again, I'll bet you I got to go searching for him again. (chuckles) I-I don't really think I'll ever find him, though. KATE: Take care, Peg. Godspeed, Mr. Adams. Thank you, Kate. Bye, Miss Brady. Mr. Hawkins... I'm proud of you. I don't know what you're talking about.

You never saw James Adams kill that man, did you? I'm sorry. God above knows I'm sorry. Tom, you best tell it all. Adams didn't kill Mr. Ferguson.
