(Jaunty, upbeat music) (Dog barking) Cat burglar workin' the neighbourhood and we're out bustin' a goddamned bookstore. This won't take very long. (Dramatic music) (Credits accompanied by ticking sound) (Woman) What time is the programme tonight? (Man) Uh, eight o'clock, I think. Well, what time are you going to get through here? (Man) Six at the latest. I wonder if you could help me out. I'm looking for a book that's, uh, a little unusual. You know, something you wouldn't find in an ordinary library? - Uh-huh. - You, uh, you got any suggestions? Just look around for yourself, mister. The jackets tell the story pretty well. Yeah, I see what you mean. Maybe you got something that's brand new, that's just come out? What about that stack of books in the window? - The Gummer Goose book? - N0, no, no, the other one there. Ah, this one here. Oh yeah, The Seven Minutes. - It's a pretty sexy cover, isn't it? - Yeah. - See you, Ben. - Eight o'clock. - You read it? - The new edition, at least. The first one was banned 35 years ago. - How come it was banned? - Because it was considered obscene. Do you think the book's obscene? Why don't you buy the book and find out for yourself? - How much is it? - $7.30 with the tax. Wrap it up. You the manager round here? Yeah, the day manager. Who do I bring it back to if I don't like it? Fremont. Ben Fremont. (Emphatic orchestral chord) Took you long enough. Literary conversations take a little doing. We'd better start comparing. Come and join me in the front seat. - Same jacket, same title. - Check. Same publisher, same publishing date and copyright. - Check. - Let's pay Mr Fremont another visit. (Suspenseful music, against ticking clock) (Dramatic orchestral chord) (Police officer) Mr Fremont? You are Ben Fremont, manager of the Argus Book Store? You're puttin' me on. Mr Fremont, I'd better introduce myself officially. I'm Sergeant Kellog, assigned to the Vice Bureau of the County Sheriff's office. I knew you seemed weird. My partner here is Officer lverson. Mr Fremont, we're placing you under arrest under Section 311.2 of the California Penal Code. What the hell for? The Code states that any person who knowingly offers to distribute any obscene matter is guilty of a misdemeanour. The District Attorney feels that the book The Seven Minutes, by J.J. Jadway, would be found obscene if taken to court. You can't arrest me. I'm just a guy who sells books. - Ijust work here. - (Dramatic orchestral chord) (Telephone ringing) (Lyrical, Gershwinesque tune) (Telephone ringing) (Slapping sound) Mike? It's Phil. Sanford. Phil? How the hell are ya? Well, I'll tell you about that in a minute. Oh, uh... congratulations are in order. I read that you took over your dad's publishing firm. - It's been a year and a half now. - You sound uptight, man. The police raided the Argus Book Store in Oakwood... Yeah, I know the store, but what's that got to do with you? They arrested the clerk, Ben Fremont, on an obscenity charge, for selling a new book of ours, The Seven Minutes, by J.J. Jadway. Now Mike? This book is not pornographic. Anyway, FremonFs been in jail several hours now, - and I want him bailed out at once. - How do you want to plead? If he pleads not guilty, that means a trial. I want to get him out of this fast and quietly. Ihave got to put a stop to the little nuisance arrests like this right at the outset. Well, now, selling pornography in California is a misdemeanour. As far as I recall, it's a maximum fine of $10,000, a year in jail, plus $5 for every unit of obscene material confiscated. Mike, but the kid was arrested once before on the same charge. Ah, excuse me, Phil. Let me see... that's a felony, now that's a $25,000 maximum fine, just for openers, and a year in prison. Damn it, Mike, I can't let Fremont go to jail for selling Sanford House's book! Wait a minute... there's one other possibility. I might be able to get the whole thing taken care of quickly and quietly. We enter a nolo plea, now that's to say a guilty plea without conceding to the charge. You pay the fine and you arrange to have the jail sentence suspended. We have a D.A. out here: a man named Elmo Duncan, - a very decent guy. - Mike... (Mike) Don't worry. I'll see Duncan tomorrow, arrange for the bail bondsman and look in on Fremont. Sorry I unloaded on you, buddy, but I'm sure you know that this is pretty important to me. Get some sleep, huh? Good night, Phil. (Laughing) You're bad! You're really bad, baby! Faye! Faye... Faye! Come on now, it's after midnight. You know, we're both tired. And you know how I hate being interrupted. Michael, Daddy isn't going to like your dirty book. When I go to work for Daddy, that's when Daddy makes the decisions. Until then, I call my own shots. (Raunchy big-band music) C'mon. Daddy was discussing us today, Michael. He's anxious to know when you're going to make an honest woman out of his daughter. I've got the message, Miss Osborn. - How is your charming fianc√©e? - She's fine, sir. You must remember me to both Faye and your prospective father-in-law. You know, if it weren't for Willard Osb0rn's dinner parties... I wouldn't have to worry about my weight. What can I do for you, Mr Barrett? Well, sir, I'm looking for a favour. Anything. Anything within reason. I'm representing the Sanford House of New York City. The publisher of The Seven Minutes. The Seven Minutes... Oh yes, the Fremont case. (Mike) That's rig ht. Mr Duncan, may I ask... have you read the book? To be quite frank about it, no. Well, a number of very important critics say that The Seven Minutes is not hardcore pornography. The sort of thing that's dumped into a drugstore by quick-buck printers appealing to the one-armed reader. The book is being published by one of the most reputable firms in the book trade. Well, let's see what it's all about. The complaint was filed by a Mrs Olivia St. Clair, President of the Strength Through Decency League in Oakwood. A couple of my boys read the book. There is no doubt in their mind it is pornographic. But the real question is whether or not The Seven Minutes is legally obscene by contemporary community standards. My client has advised me that the Jadway book is no more or less explicit than works of far less artistic merit. S0 why the sudden arrest? Well, my office has been under considerable pressure from Mrs St. Clair, with some justification. We had to satisfy her. And with Fremonfs arrest, you appeased the book-burner. We've done our duty. But then, you have a duty to your client. I'm willing to co-operate within the limitations of what already has happened. This would satisfy Sanford: Ben Fremont pleads nolo, pays a stiff fine, and in return, we have his one-yearjail sentence suspended. You understand entering a nolo plea is tantamount to pleading guilty? Which means the book will be banned in Oakwood. I don't give a damn about Oakwood. Let it be unavailable there, and that way you satisfy the STDL and their specific community. But still, The Seven Minutes could be sold anywhere else in the county. What you've suggested... well, sounds reasonable to me. This is a nuisance matter. We can treat it routinely. I'll smooth out any ruffled feathers in the Department and when that's done, you enter your plea of guilty, and I'll speak to the judge. It probably won't be any more than a fine and a suspended jail sentence. Fair enough. I should have something for you about this time tomorrow. Oh, by the way, when you see Willard Osborn, tell him I'm very appreciative of the time and attention his network has given me lately. (Man) Our next senator for the state of California! Evening, Luther. Baby Doll. - Baby Doll. - Hi! - Harvey. - Elmo. In/vin. If our President had looked that good on television a few years ago, he would have been elected Governor instead. Sorry I'm late, Luther. Things got busy downtown. (Loud rock'n'roll music) Shut that thing off! I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Before we make our move, Elmo has got to become a state-wide hero. If the voters can identify with him, we're home free. Two weeks ago, we found a meaningful issue. Namely, that much of this youthful violence is provoked by salaciousness in reading matter and in films. Then, we agreed to try to implement the California criminal code on censorship by making an arrest, thereby using a book as an issue on which to build a state-wide case - on which Elmo could fight the... - Smut merchants. Yes. And by this act, and by the trial that might follow it, Elmo would become known as a protector of the young, and an enemy of violence-inciting literature. That is a lot of crap. Enough of the pool. It pits the District Attorney against some two-bit book salesman and some obscure printed words that nobody will ever read or hear about. It should be plain to all of us now the Fremont rouse was a flop. Let's forget it, let's go on to something else - with a little more promise. - (Loud crunching) Baby Doll, will you stop that! Now there's another factor involved here. The publisher of The Seven Minutes is being represented by a Mike Barrett. You might recall that Barrett is engaged to Willard Osborn's daughter Faye. Now, considering the support I've been getting - from Osborn's television network... - The time will be... - I think it would be foolish... - ...ten... - to rock the boat. - mtwenty-nine and... - Shut that off! - (Beep, click) Elmo's right. Forget about this penny ante stuff. Ourjob tonight is to find that big issue. (Rock'n'r0ll music) Hey baby, now remember... if you just too small, you ain't tall at all. You remember what the Wolfman says now, we got these brand new Wolfman Jack elevator shoes for you, man, they're gonna blow your mind, you're gonna love 'em to death, and remember, you just slip right into 'em, man, and listen, if you just can'! get it on with your old lady now... you pay attention to me. We've got sizes six to twelve, for those who are small or large, whatever the case might be we've got the shoes just to fit you, exactly what you need. You know what I'm talking about! Now if you want your Wolfman Jack elevator shoes, just send five dollars, cash, cheque or money order. No sticker readers, you want good cheques, remember that, and you send that to TALL Shoes, KMSV Los Ange/es! Aaaaow! If you want to RIDE! We got a big hit here by Don Reed, man, Ride that love train! ...hypnotising Love goes in the dark Touch me an inner spark - Chain reaction... - Aaaow! Reach your hand in the air! Put your right hand over the radio! Wolfman Jack, your conductor. Man, I've got your ticket, and we're gonna ride that love train. Are you ready? Aaaaaal/ right! Come here, man, sock it to yourself right now! (Song gets louder) On the love train You're gonna make that mine (Sheri screams) ...I0ve train (Wolent slaps and blows) - Onto that perfect time George! George! (Crashing sound) Love train You're on a midnight ride - (Wolfman Jack inaudible) - On the love train (Shrieking and general cacophony) Love train You poor bastard stud, you make one move from there and I'll put my fist right through your face. (Song fuses with screaming) - N0! No! - I'm gonna get me some... Love train ...you got Wolfman Jack here, I'm gonna bring you on a train, we're gonna riiiiide... ...that love train! Are you ready? All right! Come on! Ride, baby, now! (Car skids to a halt) (George) You did nice work, George Mmm... Oh, she was outta sight, Jerry! But you're cool, I ain't gonna tell nobody. You know my philosophy: you keep the good thoughts and then you dump the garbage. Kinda like your biological problem with a chick. (Radio volume turned right up, drowning everything else out) (Tyres squeal) - Jerry! - On the love train You're on a midnight ride The love train Tour through the countryside The love train... (song fades out) (Car engine cuts off) (Footsteps, insects chirping) Police officers. Don't move! (Dramatic, sinister music) - D0 you have any identification? - Yeah. This what you're looking for, Griffith? - Where did you find it? - By the broken body of a young girl. (Rock'n'r0ll music) Excuse me, sir. Police Chief Patterson wishes to speak to Mr Duncan. - Let's take it on the speakerphone. - Yes, sir. Elmo! Patterson. What is it, Tim? Sorry to bother you, Mr Duncan. About an hour ago we logged a brutal 907. Rape victim, a 19-year-old Caucasian, Miss Shen' Moore, admitted to County Hospital in a coma. - There's some big game involved. - Who is it? Frank Griffith's son. Frank Griffith? The name means nothing to me. Frank Griffith handles all of Mr Yerkes' advertising. He's also one of the party's biggest contributors. That's the one. The boy denied raping the girl, and he also pleads innocent to injuring her. Any evidence to indicate the boy was lying? L'm gonna look at the sheet. Wallet, $23 in cash, three textbooks in the trunk of his car, a fourth book under the spare tyre. And coincidentally, it was the same dirty book involved in that bookseller arrest this morning: The Seven Minutes. Elmo, tell him goodbye. Son of a bitch, we've got our case! Tim, we'll discuss this in the morning. Thank you, Mr Duncan. What do you mean, "we've got our case"? Baby Doll! Shut off that damn radio! (Music clicks off) Can't the next Senator from the State of California figure this one out for himself? It's very simple. Frank Griffith's son, a poor kid with a normal sex urge... ...and they're trying to pin him with breaking and entering. (Raucous laughter) - Maybe the kid is innocent? - Who gives a goddamn? But you know who's responsible? The real criminal? It's that dirty, slimy book, The Seven Minutes that incited a decent kid from a good family - to commit felonious rape. - Yeah, but Luther... Elmo, we've finally got hold of the big issue we've been looking for. - Barman! Get the car! - Jawohl! Blair, call Frank Griffith. Tell him we just heard about his trouble and we're on our way to help him in any way we can. Now he is still innocent until proved guilty in a court of law. What I'm really saying is that the law still gives us certain options. Are you saying he can still plead not guilty? Frank, let him finish. If he pleads not guilty the case will be placed on the court calendar for trial. If he pleads guilty the sentence could be anywhere from 15 years to life. What good's all this? I already told the cops what I did! - She hurt herself! - Don't interrupt. I agree that, as things stand, a not guilty plea would not only be dishonest but futile. Trial a waste of time. Now consider this. Behind closed doors our District Attorney could have a great influence with thejudge who was to pass sentence - after a plea of guilty for rape. - But I didn't rape her! The book's the criminal, not the boy. If The Seven Minutes hadn't been available, Jerry would have never committed the crime. I see. I see. He was temporarily inflamed by that book. He was victimised. Now, we'll need time to let this concept sink into the public mind, in order to create an atmosphere much more favourable to Jerry. Doesn't anything I say mean a damn? Considering Jerry's condition, I would offer as a defence that he was not legally sane when he allegedly committed the crime. To accomplish this, we'll need the services of a top psychiatrist. I would suggest Dr Roger Trimble. I won't let any headshrinker pick my brain apart! I'm not crazy! Louis Polk knows the law. If he says your seeing a psychiatrist will help you with thejudge, it makes sense to do just that. Jerry! Let your niece calm him down. ~ Jerry! ' Maggie, l.__ I'm sure they were only trying to be helpful, in their way. I don't want my brain picked in public. - I understand, Jerry. - ljust wanna be left alone. Jerry Griffith is living proof that a dirty book can destroy a clean boy. I'm convinced we're not dealing with a mere felony, but a crime that could endanger public safety. Like, uh... an epidemic of rape? I was referring to your client's distribution of a menacing work of obscenity, Mr Barrett. If you plead Ben Fremont not guilty, we will prosecute the defendant to the limit of the law. If you prefer to enter a plea of guilty, the defendant will receive the maximum punishment for his offence: a fine, and twelve months in jail. - N0 deal deal, Mr Barrett. - (Loud clunk of weights) - ls that your last word? - Yes, Mr Barrett. What kind of a plea do you intend to enten'? Guilty or not guilty? - I'll have to consult with my client. - There can be no compromise. If you plead guilty, Fremont will go tojail for a year and the book will be banned in the county as a starter. If the plea is not guilty... ...you'll have to take your gamble in court. Really pissed me off with Duncan's attitude. Aside from being obviously hostile, he gave me that politician's holier-than-thou number. (Mike) A little to the right, honey. Higher. Yeah, right here. Mmm, that feels good. - Michael? - Mmm? Are you considering turning down Dad's position to take on Sanford's case? What's wrong, darling? I've got a late date with The Seven Minutes. I promised Sanford I'd make my decision about defending the book by tomorrow morning. ...and, taken in its entirety, and not out of context... ...the book is definitely not obscene. The Seven Minutes is a beautiful book. Oh, there's Clay Rutherford, right there. He's one of the most thorough investigative attorneys I've worked with. - Mr Rutherford. - Mr Sanford. I took the first plane out when Mike told me you two would take the case. Clay has a line-up of potential witnesses. Why don't we run through them? - Our line-up is exactly one witness. - You mean so far? No, Mr Sanford. I, uh, I mean one. Period. With the existing political climate we're not going to find many volunteers for this cause. Tell him who we got, Clay. Christian Leroux. His firm published the original edition of the book. Now we've been led to believe that he considered The Seven Minutes to be a work of artistic integrity. (Sanford) Ireca/I, however, that he sold the world publishing rights to an alleged pornographer named Norman C. Quandt. - (Clay) Any idea of his whereabouts novfi - (Sanford) N0. Clay should be able to get a line on him. Our really big issue will be to prove that Jadway wrote the book honestly, sincerely, and with artistic integrity. That's why Lemux is so important to us. - Hello, Mr Barrett. - Hi, Donna. Mr Rutherford. Sir. (Clay) We can also get some mileage out of the findings made by the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. They clearly verify that so-called obscene books and motion pictures do not contribute in any way to an increase in antisocial behaviour by adults or juveniles. Looks like it's not going to be as simple as we thought. ls it, Mike? Incredibly, Philip, no. The case is a lot more complicated now. I guess so. Mike, this might not be the right time to bring this up... but do you want me to stay for the trial? I'm up to here with pre-publication deals back home. No. As a matter of fact, it might be better to keep you out of the picture entirely, until we need you as a witness. One more thing to remember, gentlemen, Elmo Duncan will not be sitting on his ass. Our critics would like to believe that the Church's only interest is in morality and religion, at the sacrifice of freedom of speech. We wish to criticise only those who would abuse this freedom. We are of the same mind, Your Eminence. We don't want a weakened freedom, but rather reinforce it by penalising those who would corrupt it. The Church has seen fit to extend its co-operation. Wewing The Seven Minutes today, just as it did in the Thirties, when it was first banned in the Sacred Index, as an extraordinary destructive force. I couldn't be more pleased, Your Eminence. I own enlighten, and will help you. (Mike) Now, the police report states that they confiscated eighty copies of The Seven Minutes... ...and the Sanford House sales department account shows... ...they shipped a hundred copies to this store. - Those figures correct? - Uh-huh. That means you sold twenty copies before you were arrested. - Any idea who bought them? - Zero. I only work here days. Have you seen the picture of Jerry Griffith in the newspaper? His picture and mine too. I've got a better shot of him right here, and I want you to take a close look at this. - He ever been in this store? - Not that I can recall. With all this publicity, I get phone calls every day, asking ifl have the book for sale. Even Rachel Hoyt, the head branch librarian for the Oakwood Library called this morning, very uptight about this attempt to ban The Seven Minutes. Interesting. She won't wait to order the book through channels. She wants to pick one up herself, put it on the open shelves, and have a showdown with the old bags who run the Strength Through Decency League. Would you believe Frank Griffith telling the press it was J.J. Jadway and The Seven Minutes, not his son, who was responsible for Sheri Moore's brutal attack. When was the last time you saw Jerry? That was it. He sent a friend over to return the dictionary. Do you recall his friend? A long-haired boy. The only one I saw with Jerry more than once. I think his name was Perkins. I hear you're a good friend of Jerry Griffith's. Who told you that? Head librarian, at the Oakwood branch. Said she saw you with him a couple of times. He's got wheels. He gave me a lift now and then. That's about it. Well, lwas told that you were close friends. You were told wrong, man. Did you ever meet any members of Jerry's family? Nope. Did you ever hear Jerry discuss his father? Nope. When was the last time you saw him? Maybe a week before he beat on that chick. - And you haven't seen him since? - N0. And I wouldn't want to, either. - How come? - With all the available chicks around here, who wants to owe the guy who gets it that way? - That's a bummer. - I hear he reads a lot. What the hell do these look like? Everybody reads a lot here. Yeah, I guess you're right, but I'm only interested in one particular book. Have you ever seen him reading The Seven Minutes or discussing it? Oh, you're sounding like a pig. Like a stinkin' pig. Fuck off! The services of Father Sarsatti, one of the two priests directly in charge of the Sacred Index, has been offered as a leading witness for your prosecution. Father Sarsatti is prepared to make public all the classified information the Church has on the infamous book and its equally infamous author. Do you wish him as a witness for the prosecution? Yes, Your Eminence. I must have him. - When do you want him in here? - Within three days. Four at the most. I will notify the Vatican. Father Sarsatti will be here. And the Lord will bless our cause. (Uplifting, hymn-like music) I'm Olivia St. Clair, President of the Oakwood Chapter of the Strength Through Decency League. (Polite applause) Most of you already know that our President has called for a citizens' crusade against obscenity, both in print and in pictures. That's just what the STDL is trying to implement. Our work was never more important than it is today. - (St. Clair) The fact that there are... - (Faye) Why the big rush? It's not exactly like you're the guest of honour. Hey, there's someone I know. Maggie, how are you? - Good to see you, Faye. - (Faye) Oh, forgive me. Meet my fiance'. Maggie Russell, Michael Barrett. How do you do? I thought I recognised you. You mean those terrible newspaper pictures do me justice? I happen to have a special interest in your case. (St. Clair) "hard-hitting action. And by that I mean vigorous, positive enforcement - of existing obscenity laws... - We'd better grab a seat. ...all over the country. - And, with courageous Americans... - See you around, Maggie! ...like our guest of honour today, to do the enforcing. It is now with the greatest of pleasure that I give you our county's distinguished District Attorney, - Mr Elmo Duncan. - (Applause) Thank you. Thank you very much. Glad you all could make it. Mrs St. Clair has asked me to say a few words on the subject of pornography as related to our permissive society. I cannot think of a subject which is more relevant. There is virtually no area that remains untainted by the quick-buck artists who pander to our lowest forms of taste and the public be damned. Just the other evening, my first night off in weeks, I decided to take my wife Mary and our three children to the movies. In our neighbourhood, we had such subject material as rape, lust, motorcycle gangs, homosexuals, - lesbianism... - I'm going to take a walk. - I'll be right back. - ...drug abuse, you name it. Whatever happened to the movies we used to be able to take our children to? - (Applause) - (Mike) Remember to tell me what I missed. Films that offered real movie stars, Like the charming lady seated to my left, Miss Constance Cumberland. (Enthusiastic applause) Never in the history of our great nation has there been such a proliferation of obscene material on the screen, the magazine racks, and the bookshelves. - The pomographers... - (Mike) Miss Russell! While I had a chance lwanted to have a few words with you about your relatives the Griffiths. Faye mentioned your relationship with Jerry. And? Well, she said you were very close to him. We're not only relatives, we're friends. I'm prepared to defend Jerry against anyone who wants to hurt him. Well, I have no reason to hurt Jerry. My interest in him is merely professional. You see, from what I know about juvenile delinquency, I'm not convinced that reading-matter alone can be held responsible for antisocial acts. I was hoping we'd have a chance to talk about this. I won't even dignify the thought of such a discussion. I suppose it'd be foolish of me to ask if Jerry's father would see me? You can't be serious, Mr Barrett. You're annoying me. - Well, I'm sorry, I really am. - (Car engine starts) But you could have snubbed me. Good manners, Miss Russell? Not good manners, Mr Barrett. I just wanted to find out if you were really the kind of son of a bitch everyone said you were. Jerry, I feel these sessions can be very beneficial to you. I don't like to talk about myself. Well, I'm afraid your father and Mr Yerkes have other plans concerning your co-operation this afternoon. You tell him his loser company ain't worth that much money! Well, fly him back from the goddamn safari! When people find out he's killing defenseless animals with a machine gun, it's eighty-six for him anyway. (Raucous laughter) What an idea for Art Buchwald's column! How'd it go? Well, Jerry is completely ambivalent about Sheri Moore. On the one hand he hates to discuss the circumstance, but on the other when he does discuss it he reveals a certain pride in the act. What else? Jerry also has a wish for self-destruction, possibly real but more likely fantasy. I feel he should be subjected to as few pressures as possible. Frank, the boy needs help. He's in bad shape. What the hell's wrong now? We'll never get him to testify until we get him back on the track. I think the kid and Trimble should get together every day between now and the trial. Well, that makes a great deal of sense. Fine. Now, let's see what's happening in the other room. (Lushly romantic piano music) Good to see you, Merle! Griffith! Trimble! Come over here! I want you to meet Merle Reid, a truly great American. Mr Reid, this is a real pleasure. I catch your newscast every night. You flatter me, Mr Griffith. I hope you'll tell that to the rating surveyors when they call. (Everyone laughs) I'm really looking fonlvard to this, Luther. When my viewers see what the smut peddlers have done to that poor young boy, you'll have a groundswell of sentiment big enough to swamp the Queen Mary. (Thumps table) Good man. I think they're ready. Well, Jerry, you won't feel a thing. You have nothing to worry about. (Crew member) Any time you're ready, Mr Reid. We're rolling. - Speed. Jerry Griffith interview, take one. - (Clapperboard snaps shut) And action, Mr Reid! Ladies and gentlemen, I am sitting in the home of the Frank Griffith family. An average American family, if you will, until the night before last, when a shattering experience catapulted them into the headlights. Young Jerry Griffith, whom you see seated beside me, was taken into police custody and charged with the most heinous crime. A crime which had been perpetrated by the reading of an awful, ugly, and... yes, I'll use the word, a patently obscene book. Until now, not one soul from the television media has been granted the opportunity of speaking with young Jerry. But he and his father have graciously allowed me the privilege of being the first and only news man to hear the family's side of the story. Tell me, Jerry, was The Seven Minutes part of your reading assignments at the university? I really don't wanna talk about it. I couldn't be more in sympathy with your feelings. But the public does have a right to know how this book led you astray. Tell us now exactly how The Seven Minutes prompted you to run out and violate this girl. (Emphatic, echoing chords) I don't wanna talk about it! (Frenzied orchestral music) (Voice trembling) For the first time in my newscasting career, I am speechless. Permit me, however, to leave you with this question. How many other killer books are in the hands of your sons and daughters? Yes, your sons and daughters, this very moment. Now you've seen what a dirty book can do to a youngster. No, I've seen sickness, Mr Yerkes, but it wasn't caused by any book. You'd better go shopping for a new psychiatrist. - You can't afford me. - Nowjust a minute, you... That footage on his cracking up is gonna be great! Simply first class. (Emphatic orchestral music) Operator, this is KME 515. Give me CR 72211 please. Barrett and Rutherford. Donna, are you still taking those courses at the university? Yes, sir, three nights a week. Any rap about Jerry Griffith? One girl in my econ class did mention that she saw him occasionally at the Lube Rack. Oh really? I'll be up in a couple of minutes. Yes sir, Mr Barrett. Barrett! You the lawyer who's defending that dirty book? Yes, I... I'm Sheri Moore's father, you son of a bitch! And I'm warning you to keep your goddamn nose out of our private affairs! My poor girl's damn near dead because some little punk was made crazy by your damn dirty book! - Well, I've had it, you hear? - (Cuts to sustained vocal note) (Loud rock music) Get up, baby Dance on the drums We're gonna shake you till morning comes. (Backing vocals) Shake you ti/I morning comes Get up, baby Turn on the juice Shake a little back - Gonna work it loose - (inaudible dialogue) - You just gotta work it loose - (inaudible dialogue) (inaudible dialogue) You can't have no midnight tricks Midnight tricks Midnight tricks Midnight tricks Get off your high horse Work out the kinks (inaudible dialogue) Get up baby Let out the slack Too far gone, gotta turn it round (inaudible dialogue) You can't have no midnight tricks Midnight tricks Midnight tricks Midnight tricks (Pills rattling) Loosen up, baby Let out the slack... - (knocks on window) - Jerry? Jerry! Nembutals. It's lucky you got him here when you did. Another five minutes, and he'd have been finished. He gave me this piece of paper with a name and phone number on it. Said it was the only one to be contacted. I thought I told you... Jerry? He can't be with you, he's not allowed to leave the house. What happened? Where? I'll be right there. Dr Quigley's a good man. He'll make a discreet report, and everything will be kept very quiet. Ijust can't imagine what made Jerry do it. I'd like to ask you something. - Go ahead. - Were you following Jerry? No. I was looking for someone else. One of his friends, George Perkins. I'm sorry. You must think I suspect every move you make. Music? Jerry was bugged by a couple of things that happened at the house today. Now no-one expects you to be unfaithful to the cause. Luther Yerkes was there today. He brought over a psychoanalyst, and Jerry was forced to go into therapy with this guy against his will. Luther Yerkes at the Griffiths. Until now I'd only heard rumours that he was backing Duncan for the Senate. Then, Mr Yerkes wheeled out Merle Reid to interview Jerry on coast-to-coast television. - Just simply... - You know, I always think... - Excuse me, go ahead. - N0, no, you go ahead. You know, my whole attitude toward you has changed 180 degrees. Before I came to work for the Griffiths, there was a woman working there as a nurse to Mrs Griffith. After she quit or was fired, that's when I was offered the job. Maybe she could give you a little help? Do you remember her name? Isabel Vogler. She lived out in Laurelvale. That's the most I can offer you by way of appreciation for what you did tonight. Thank you. Now I've got to run. Thank you. L'd like to see you again. No prying, I promise. Strictly social. It's tempting, but I'm afraid not. If I was seen with you in public... But if I can ever help you in any way that doesn't jeopardise my relationship with the family... - Well, you have my private number. - I'll remember that. Oh, by the way, I read The Seven Minutes. It's a beautiful book. (Music playing) You've got a suspicious look on your face. (Faye) How can you drink that in the morning? Is that why you stopped by? To check on my drinking habits? You were supposed to call last night. I got into this... thing. Part of the investigation. You know the woman you passed by on the way out of here? Well, uh... that was Frank Griffith's former housekeeper, Mrs Isabel Vogler. Now, she's agreed to testify at the trial about the conditions existing in the Griffith home. Particularly as to how they affected one Mr Jerry Griffith. Can you trust someone like that? Mrs Vogler is as trustworthy as any of Duncan's witnesses. S0 why the sudden concern? I'm just worried about the nasty people you're becoming associated with over an unworthy piece of trash. First of all, the book isn't a piece of trash. There's no-one around to contaminate me, so let's cool it, huh? Well, I've gotta get to the office now, or I'll be late. Faye? Faye, I really am sorry about last night. See you later and make up for it, huh? - Both good and bad news, Mike. - Give me the bad first. Lemux sold out for a higher price and he's flying in from Paris to testify for Duncan. The good news is that I've located Norman C. Quandt. Gee, that's great. Where is he? He operates something called the, uh, Arts and Sciences Cinema Company - at 348 Donovan Drive. - Imposing title. Well, it's probably one of the leading manufacturers of pornographic movies on the West Coast. Nudies, beavers, the whole bit. - When could I see him? - Right now, man. He's expecting you. - I'm on my way. - Okey doke. (Quandt) There's nothing dirty about these pictures. Now back to that creep Leroux, let's go to my office and check the files. Back in '47 I flew over to Paris to get a first-hand look at some of the highly touted French stuff. My contact was Leroux, a publisher of dirty books and part-time pimp. Among other things, he made me an offer for three raunchy paperbacks. One of them was The Seven Minutes. Do you recall him saying anything about the author of The Seven Minutes, J.J. Jadway? Yeah, in fact he turned over a pack of letters written by Jadway to his mistress, some chick named... - Cassie McGraw? - Yeah. You mean you actually have letters written by Jadway? Till a week ago. I unloaded them on an autograph dealer in New York. Can you give me his name, the autograph hunter? (Siren blares) (Panicked shrieking) (inaudible shouting) Get outta the place! You'll tip the D.A.! You gotta be out of your head. I'm on the other side! He's sent them round to me before! - Now get outta here! - The autograph dealer! Olin Adams, 55th Street New York. (Olin Adams) You got a deal, Mr Barrett. I can send the letters out to you C.O.D. in the morning. No, I need them sooner than that. I'm flying to New York tonight. I'll be in your shop between nine and ten, and I'll pay in cash. - As you wish, sir. - Right. Jadway speaking from the grave. Those letters can wipe out Leroux's contention that Jadway was a money-hungry pornographer, and we've got Isabel Vogler to put down Jerry Griffith's testimony that the book alone turned him on. - We are finally getting it together. - (Phone buzzes) - Yeah, Donna. - There's an urgent call - from Miss Osborn on 3. - Thank you. Hello, pretty lady. Michael, I know you cancelled out on me tonight because you're loaded with work, but I have to see you. It's terribly important. I'm flying out of here tonight at eight o'clock. I, uh... I'll tell you what. You can pick me up and drive me to the airport, and we'll talk on the way. I'll pick you up at 7:15. Mr Griffith places a large amount of advertising on Dad's television stations, so naturally you can understand how Daddy felt when he heard you were going to call a witness who would malign Frank Griffith. How did Dad feel? Concerned enough to pay a visit to Mr Griffith to prepare for any libel Mrs Vogler might be offering. - Beautiful. - After his talk with Griffith, Dad was convinced Mrs Vogler is a psychopathic liar. OK, so now you've told me the urgent news, what else? Dad wants me to tell you that any thought you have of using Isabel Vogler on the witness stand is out of the question. - He was positive about that. - Oh, was he now? I promised him that once I spoke to you there would be no problem. But there is a problem, Faye. I will use Mrs Vogler on the witness stand. You're behaving like an ass. I can't believe you'd give up everything to defend your little house of filth. - I won't accept it. - You'd better, Faye, - because ljust can't meet your terms. - (Brakes squealing) Then you are an ass. You're second-rate, Mike, and I only have time for number one! (Car door shuts) Tell dear old Dad he'll just have to find himself a more willing patsy. - Go to hell! - (Tyres screech) - Mr Adams? I'm Michael Barrett. - Mr Barrett? That's right. I spoke to you yesterday afternoon, about the Jadway letters? Oh, I know I should have been here earlier, but I got hung up in traffic. Nevertheless, I'm here, and if I could see those letters, please? But sir, a Mr Barrett has already picked up those letters. - I beg your pardon? - A gentleman came by here a minute or two after I opened this morning. He paid the $800 and I gave him the letters and he left immediately. That can't be. I can prove who I am. Well, look at it! S0 who the hell was it that came by here and picked up your purchase this morning? Well, Mr Adams, that's what I'd like you to tell me. - Can you describe him for me? - He was... he was much taller than you. Formal, very dignified. I really didn't pay much attention. Well, thanks for your trouble. But I am deeply sorry, Mr Barrett. Good luck to you. Yeah. Donna, catch me the first flight back to the coast. Oh, before I forget, tell Clay that I'll call Sanford and brief him on his coming appearance in court. (Inserts money) (Dials) Yeah, operator? I'd like to make a long distance call to Miss Maggie Russell. (Phone rings) - Hello? - Hello, Maggie? Michael Barrett here. Now, I know your rules, but I really have to see you. It's important. ls this strictly business, or business and pleasure? Well, it's partly business, but seeing you would be a pleasure. Won't Faye Osborn mind? Well, we're not seeing each other any more. Oh? Where are you now? - Manhattan. - Manhattan? Yep. Now it's 3:30 New York time and I can meet you in my office at 8:00 your time. (Thud, Mike groans) Michael? Can you hear me, Michael? - They got away with it. - With what? They planted a monitor on my phone, and they decided to remove the evidence, and yours truly stumbled in on them. It's not the first time. There've been half a dozen other incidents just as incredible. Mrs Isabel Vogler suddenly refusing to testify, the loss of some original Jadway letters, and the real stunner was the loss of Leroux, the Frenchman who first published The Seven Minutes. Now he's saying Jadway's nothing more than a squalid pornographer. The man with the big chequeb0ok's got the advantage. - (Maggie exclaims joyfully) - (Mike) Very good! Uh... shall we? I have an early day tomorrow and if you're going to be in shape for court, you should have been in bed an hour ago. - Why, hello, Miss Russell. - Mr Blair. - (Projector whirring) - I'll tell you one thing, those broads are not acting. Focus. Focus, goddamnit! We're missing the best part. That's better. Where did we get this stuff, Elmo? Norman C. Quandt, S.O.B. One of these days I'm gonna throw him in the slammer and toss away the key. Now hold it, Elmo. He may not be an L.B. Mayer, but you've gotta admit he makes great pictures. Besides, we've gotta protect the public. - (Phone rings) - Yerkes here. Mr Yerkes, I'm over here at the Daze. Just five minutes ago I ran into Maggie Russell, Frank Gfiffith's niece. And who do you think she was with? - Michael Barrett, counsellor for the defence. - Thanks, Blair. Son ofa bitch! Goddamn her! Wait till I put that girl on the carpet. Hold it, Frank, hold it. If you kick her ass out she could very easily be used as a witness against us. - You agree, Elmo? - It's a possibility, Luther. That's why we're not going to interfere with Maggie and Barrett. - It may turn out to be an advantage. - Advantage? How? Tell her you heard she was out with Barrett. But you're gonna be just as sweet as honey. Buy her story, whatever she says. You're the great white father trying to protect his son. I approve, Griffith. I agree with Luther 100%. - How can she resist? - (Elmo) It's an inspired approach. For you, for your son, and for our common cause. The state of California has charged an unknown bookseller named Ben Fremont with selling filth in the form of an underground novel, The Seven Minutes, which was written by an expatriate author, J.J. Jadway, over three decades ago. Now this trial has generated enormous interest, and in light of impending Supreme Court hearings on the question of obscenity in films and reading matter, this case could assume a stature of national importance. Please rise. Face the flag of our country, recognising the principles for which it stands: liberty and justice for all. Department 101 of the Superior Court of the State of California is now in session, the Honourable Nathaniel Upshawjudge presiding. - Please be seated, and no smoking. - (Gavel bangs) The case of the People of the State of California versus Ben Fremont. - Is the defence ready to proceed? - Yes, Your Honour. - Are the people ready to proceed? - Yes, Your Honour. You may call your first witness, Mr Duncan. I call Sergeant Frank Kellog of the County Sheriffs Department to the stand. Please raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - I do. - State your name for the record. Sergeant Frank Kellog, County Sheriff's Office, Administrative Woe. Please be seated. Sergeant Kellog, is the man who sold you a copy of - The Seven Minutes in this courtroom? - Yes, sir, he is. Would you point him out to the court, please? That's him. Let the record show, Your Honour, the witness Sergeant Kellog indicated the defendant Ben Fremont, seated to the left of defence counsel. Did Mr Fremont make any comment about the book, any reference to its erotic explicitness? Well, the defendant Mr Fremont told me it was the most banned book in history. He said, and I quote, "It was banned in every country in the world "because it was considered obscene." Those were Mr Fremonfs own words. Your witness, Mr Barrett. Sergeant Kellog, on your visit to the Argus Book Store, did you impersonate an ordinary customer? No sir, that's not quite true. But since you intended to buy the book for the purposes of assembling evidence against the defendant, didn't you feel dishonest about representing yourself as a customef? Objection. The witness's feelings are immaterial. - Objection sustained. - Forgive me, Your Honour. Sergeant Kellog, why was it necessary to use a concealed tape recordef? Well, that's standard operating procedure. If we were going to bust a hooker... (Widespread laughter) ...l mean, arrest a prostitute, we'd do the same thing. That's perfectly legal. Well, I won't bother to comment on the ethics of those vice officers who circulate among bars trying to entrap hoo... mprostitutes. But I do wonder how you feel about entrapping a respectable bookseller with leading questions and concealed tape recorders? (Elmo) My next witness, in a manner of speaking, will be the book itself. I now submit that The Seven Minutes be read aloud to the members of the jury, so that they may become acquainted with its entire contents. Seated in the witness box is a neutral impartial citizen, a Mr Charles Wynter, a substitute high school teacher locally, who in his spare time tapes recordings for the blind, and is accustomed to reading aloud without over-dramatising or unduly emphasising specific passages. Objection, your honour! With all due deference to the blind, the prosecution's remarks are deliberately intended to appeal to the sympathy of the jury. Objection overruled. The District Attorney's description of Mr Wynter leaves no doubt of his ability to remain impartial. (Elmo) Thank you, Your Honour. Your Honour, while I already have this person available, I would willingly agree to let anyone of Mr Barrett's choosing read the book aloud to the jury. Your Honour, what I care about is the book being read aloud. A novel is not meant to be presented in such a fashion. That is my only objection. Your objection, Mr Barrett, is overruled. Mr Wynter may begin reading the book in manner so prescribed by the court. Thank you, Your Honour. Mr Wynter? (Judge) You may begin, but please address the reading to the jury. (Slowly and pedantically) A touch. ls that you? My other lips swell in joyous welcome. God, I have missed you. There. Now move slowly past my moist lips. Darling, let me kiss all of you. Feel me close around you in sweet embrace. Your Honour, I would like to record my concern about one mannerism possessed by the reader, Mr Wynter, which may be prejudicial to the defence. The reader is placing undue emphasis by raising his eyes on certain passages which might be termed "sexually realistic". Mr Barrett, I have been watching Mr Wynter closely. I am satisfied he is performing in a manner as mechanical and objective as possible for a human being. I must deny your request. Please resume, Mr Wynter. You were so strong, and yet when we are together we both grow weak with the delicious perfection of our union. This is your home. This is the reason for our existence. As a noted British publisher of quality books, and a highly recognised authority on the continental trade, Mr Van Fleet, do you feel that Jadway, the author of The Seven Minutes, tried to give the reader some understanding or vision of love? Mr Jadway knew nothing of love. Let me tell you a favourite anecdote about Jadway. The story comes first-hand from a simply marvellous study entitled Outside the Mainstream. The author is Dr Hiram Eberhart, a highly respected professor at Columbia University. Now, I'm going to quote from him directly... Your Honour, I object! This supposed anecdote from that book would represent the rankest form of hearsay. I object to any reading from outside the mainstream whatsoever. I am conversant with Dr Eberhart, and believe his book to be very material, Counsel. Don't antagonise them. The witness will continue. "One night, after listening to a prizefight on the radio, "a contest in which Joe Louis wrested the heavyweight championship "from one James Braddock, Jadway told friends who had been listening to it "with him that love between a man and a woman "was most often performed like a prizefight. "When Jadway was asked to give examples of books "that depicted the more common hostile love, "he cited Henry Miller's Tropic of Capricorn, "which he had just read, "as a book that reflected the brutality of l0ve." One of your witnesses, Elmo, has got to be a thinking man's faggot. Those queens are so afraid of anything straight, they're bound to be on our side. "Mthroughout The Seven Minutes is an act of hatred against womanhood. "Jadway has unconsciously taken on the role of a pugilist "attempting to down and humiliate the opposite sex." End quote. lfind myself in total agreement with Dr Eberhart. How much did we offer to pay him to testify? Transportation plus five big ones. Please raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - I do. - State your name for the record. - My name is Christian Leroux. - Please be seated. I wonder how much he got from the D.A.? You'd better believe it wasn't chopped liver. Mr Leroux, what is your present occupation? I'm a publisher of books. When did you first become a publisher? In 1933 my father died, leaving me a very modest inheritance. S0 I established my own publishing house, the Etoile Press. Is this the same publisher that brought out a work of fiction in 1935 entitled - The Seven Minutes, by J.J. Jadway? - The same. Mr Leroux, I have seen your original version of this book, which was printed in English. Since it was published in Paris, why was it not in the French language? The French government wouldn't permit its publication in French. Why not? The Censorship Bureau declared it was obscene. Obscene. To your knowledge, has The Seven Minutes ever been published in any other country in any other language? Oh no. Absolutely no nation in the world would pass on it or even accept it. Literary critics in many countries regarded it as the most depraved book ever published in the history of literature. Your Honour, I object to Mr Leroux's self-serving answer, and I ask that it be stricken on the grounds that it is incompetent. (Judge) I think that the witness is qualified to give that answer. Motion to strike is denied, and objection overruled. Proceed, Mr Duncan. Mr Leroux, what kind of commercial success did The Seven Minutes have in France? Well, not as much as we'd hoped. My initial printing was 5,000 copies. This sold out in a year. Then I ordered a press run of another 5,000 copies, but the sales slowed down and eventually stopped. That is after the Vatican placed the book on the Index. (Mike) Father Sarsatti, you testified that the Curia Offices had been revamped and streamlined since J.J. Jadway's book was first published in 1935. Yes, in 1966, in keeping with the new Ecumenical Council spirit which pervaded the Church and all of Christendom. Pope Paul VII abolished the title of the Supreme Congregation of the Holy Office because it had long been held offensive by Protestants who associated it with what they regarded as persecution in early Church history. Is it not, true, Father, that at the convening of the Ecumenical Council there were numerous Roman Catholic clerics who protested against the old Holy Office, the very office that condemned Jadway, because it did not hold fair hearings for authors? The Catholic Church is a democratic body. Its bishops and cardinals are given total freedom in the formation of their opinion. There were those who chose to express some measure of disagreement with the rulings of the Holy Office. Would it not follow, then, Father, that in view of the new liberality on the part of the Church, that what the Church condemned and prohibited in 1935 it might not condemn and prohibit today? Signore, sir, that is a hypothetical question which I have neither the qualifications nor the authority to answer. Let me say this, however, that I am here before you as a representative of the Vatican, because the Church is just as concerned today as it was in 1935 about the publication and circulation of an immoral and sacrilegious work of fiction entitled The Seven Minutes. You got it now, Harvey. I want you to hit them with as many numbers as possible. Make it sound like this dame is second cousin to every one of those clowns in that jury box. Our average woman resides in an urban area, in a city of less than 100,000 population, which qualifies Oakwood to supply this woman. She has a five-room home worth $11,000, half the house is mortgaged, the house has a bathtub or shower, flush toilet, electricity, telephone, TV set and washing machine. No air conditioning, no clothes dryer, no food freezer. The average woman spends seven hours a day in the kitchen, performing her household chores. Very impressive, Mr Underwood. You've covered everything except her frequency of elimination, and the time of day she prefers to fornicate. (Bangs gavel) Let us observe some of the rules of taste, Counsellor. And would you please refrain from turning your back to the court? Forgive me, Your Honour, but I feel the court should be a little more enlightened about the average person, especially in relationship to statistics. Now as I understand it, 51% of the U.S. population is female, while 49% is male. Now according to what you've said, that means the average American is only female. Now is that true? Of course not. One can't average two absolutes. I was referring to concepts that can be converted into statistics, such as age or income. I appreciate your wanting to talk about numbers, Mr Undenlvood, but I want to talk about persons. Specifically, the average person mentioned in the Criminal Code. Let me ask the jury this: Supposing 50% of the American population was male, and 50% was female. Wouldn't the average American be a queer? - (Widespread laughter) - Order! Order! Order! Now that we've established your qualifications as an average housewife to the court's satisfaction, Mrs White, can you tell us whether you read a novel called The Seven Minutes, written by J.J. Jadway? I have. lforced myself to read it from cover to cover. As an average person in your community, applying contemporary standards, what was your reaction to this book? I found it sickeningly obscene. Did you feel it went beyond the customary limits of candour in its description of nudity or sef? The Seven Minutes belongs in a garbage disposal. If I had one, that's where the book would go. - (Elmo) Did you find anything in the novel... - (inaudible whispering) ...that could be considered as having social redeeming importance? It was sex and more sex, and nothing else. I never laid eyes on reading matter more obscene. Thank you, Mrs White. Your witness, counsellor. Mrs White, since you are the first average woman I've ever met, I'm eager to know a little more about your taste. I'm anxious to know if your reading habits are also average. - They are. - Oh? How do you know they are? I read a lot. All the popular things that come into the library, and in paperback. Have you ever read Peyton Place, by Grace Metalious? Of course not. Have you read God's Little Acre, by Erskine Caldwell? No, I haven't. Have you read Lady Chattefley's Lover, by D.H. Lawrence? I have not. Have you read In His Steps, by Charles Sheldon? No. I never even heard of it. That's very interesting, Mrs White. Then by Mr Undewvoods standards your reading habits are far from average. You see, the four novels I have just mentioned sold over thirty million copies in this country alone. To which I object, Your Honour. The Counsel is badgering the witness in front of thejury, and is asking questions in argumentative form. I know twenty books that outsold the novels Barrett mentioned. Those are four of the five leading best-sellers in American history. (Judge) Gentlemen, let's proceed in an orderly fashion. I expect both of you to abide by the rules of evidence. Now let's get on with the trial. Mrs White, would the average American read The Seven Minutes? Absolutely not. But you're supposedly average, and you read it, didn't you? I was requested to read it for this trial. Oh? Otherwise, you would not have read it? Most certainly not. I don't waste my time with obscene reading. But Mrs White, how would you know it was obscene if you didn't read it? I don't have to drink poison to know that it's poison. Do you believe that writers should say what they mean when writing about sex? Yes. But they can do that without using indecent words, like the words in that book. Can you be specific about the words in The Seven Minutes that offended you? Well, I'm certainly not going to use them. Point them out. Let me see what you object to. Go ahead. The book won't bite. Very fine, Mrs White. I appreciate your co-operation. Now, what we have here is the word "fucking". (Shocked murmuring) ls that correct? Excuse me, Mrs White? - That is the word you object to? - Disgusting. Would you have been happier if the writer had used such euphemisms as "they slept togethef", "they were intimate" or "they made love"? I would have understood just as well what the author was trying to say. But you could have been wrong? If Kathleen and her man had slept together, were intimate or they made love, they might have been doing many other things other than the only exact word for this particular act. It cannot be mistaken. Mrs White, I'm not advocating that coarse or vulgar words should be used by everyone everywhere. I am saying that writers from Chaucer to Jadway should be allowed the freedom to use specific precise words when writing realistically. Now, wouldn't you agree, Mrs White? I am not interested in the past, Mr Barrett. I'm interested in protecting our morality in the present. Especially the morality of our young people, so that our civilisation doesn't decay and decline the way others have done. (Emphatic music) Thank you. Remember when Van Fleet mentioned the anecdote about the night Jadway was listening to Joe Louis win the heavyweight title - by knocking out Braddock? - Yeah. - When did Jadway die? - February 1937. Correct. Jadway killed himself and was promptly cremated in February 1937. But here we have Dr Eberhart telling us how Jadway read and discussed Tropic of Capricorn. Capricorn wasn't published until 1939. Well, maybe Dr Eberhart confused his source of information. We confuse Tropic of Capricorn with Tropic of Cancer, which I'm sure was published while Jadway was still very much alive. No, no, listen to this. Page 624: "Joe Louis knocked out Jim Braddock "in the eighth round in Chicago in June 1937." Get it? June 1937. That means that Jadway was listening to the fight four months after he was supposed to be dead. - Now how does that grab you? - A lot better. The distinguished Dr Eberhart may have been wrong a second time. But twice in one paragraph from a renowned scholar? Highly unlikely. This gives us a new and revived Jadway who did not die in February 1937 as Leroux and the priest testified. It gives us Jadway very much alive, four months later. For that matter, is he even dead? (Emphatic music) Clay? We're back in business. You handle the cross-examination tomorrow. If I hustle, I can catch the late flight to New York. Eberhart could save our ass. A mistake could have been made only by my source. Dr Eberhart, I was unaware that there was any source involved besides you. You see, I assumed that you were present when Jadway made the... No, I was not. My confidential source was one of Jadway's closest friends in Paris in the 1930s. - Who was he? - Well, considering how I was misled... ...l see no reason not to reveal his name. I acquired the information from a poet named Sean O'Flanagan. My name's Michael Barrett. May I sit down? - Depends. - Could I buy you a drink? Grab a chair. Guinness, a flagon of your best brandy, with a water back. What can I do for you, young man? Well, sir, I'm the lawyer defending the reputation of your old friend, J.J. Jadway. Oh yes, The Seven Minutes. Dr Hiram Eberhart led me to believe that you were one of Jadway's closest friends. Correct, young man. That's precisely why I won't discuss this subject. - Keep the change. - Thank you. On the contrary, Mr O'Flanagan, the censors won't let him rest. If I could only find out when Jadway died, and how. Suicide. Jumped into the Grand Canal, the poor wretched soul and drowned. - When was that? - Allow me. The year of our Lord 1937 Anno Domini, amen. Then there appears to be a slight contradition concerning the date of Jadway's death, based on the material that you supplied Dr Eberhart. Eberhart put it down wrong and didn't hear me right. He taped the interview with you. I guess I screwed up my dates and times, but I remember Jadway's death as if it were yesterday. It was in all the papers. Hurled himself from a six-storey apartment building in San Francisco. A minute ago you had him drowning in the Grand Canal. Did I now? Could you have been mistaken about the date of Jadway's death? Maybe he died in 1939 or '40, instead of 1937. That is not possible. Jadway was alive long after that. He enlisted the day after Pearl Harbor. Made mincemeat of the Kaiser. The Kaiser was World War I. A pity you can't ask Cassie McGraw about that. Whatever happened to her? Only the shadow knows. Good day to you, Mr Battle. - Michael! Michael! Over here! - Maggie! Somebody once told me that happiness is being met at the airport. - I had to see you. - You look great. I thought you'd be interested in what happened in court. I spent the day in the gallery. You must be psychic. Things were so tight trying to make the plane I didn't have a chance to call the office. Duncan brought out two more literary experts, a professor from Colorado and a syndicated book reviewer. Both said the book was obscene and put it down for its prurient appeal. He also dragged in the two cops who found Sheri Moore and the physician who examined her after the rape. (Mike) I'm sure Clay didn't let Duncan get away with cheap courtroom theatrics. ...evidence of sperm within the vagina. Objection! The violation of Miss Moore has nothing to do with this alleged obscenity case! Your Honour, the police witnesses are the foundation for Jerry Griffith's appearance. This is relevant and material, because I will show that the obscene pages from the Jadway book created the wish to commit rape within Jerry Griffith, and then drove him to act out this wish. (Mike) So w/I-lat else have I missed? (Maggie) Well, for one thing you have no idea of the conflict going on at the house over Jerry's testifying. (Mike) is he still resisting? I... I want to ask you not to put Jerry on the witness stand. Before you say anything, let me finish. And I won't say "do it for me, Mike", but for Jerry's sake alone please waive your cross-examination. I'm sorry, Maggie, but I can't betray the people who've retained me. The D.A.'s had his own way so far, and now he plans to prove the dangerous influence of Jadway's writing by hitting us with Jeny Griffith. Now, this is our first opportunity to stop him. (Maggie) But Jeny is paralysed with fear over the cross-examination. He might even try to take his own life again. But if we don't defend ourselves here, then we'll go under, and the censors strike another important blow against free speech. If I had Leroux, Mrs Vogler, even a star witness like Cassie McGraw... And you can have her, Mike. You promise not to cross-examine Jerry and I promise to get you Cassie McGraw herself. Please raise your right hand. You swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth? - I do. - State your name for the record. Jerry, erm... Jerome Griffith. Please be seated. Jerry Griffith, may I ask what is your present occupation? - Student. - Jerry, would you mind speaking up? - You said... - I'm a student. How long have you been at the university? Almost two years. Before this year... well, let's say during your last year of high school, your first two years of college, how frequently did you go on dates with girls? It's... it's hard to remember. I can't remember how frequently. Well, can you give an approximation of how frequently? Objection, Your Honour. The witness has stated that he does not remember. I'm going to object on the grounds that the question has been asked and answered. Also, it's speculative. Objection sustained. - Jerry, what is your major? - English literature Do your courses demand considerable reading? Say at least three books a week? Objection. The District Attorney is leading the witness. Overruled. The witness may answer the question. Thank you, Your Honour. ls it a fact that you read at least three books a week? Yes, sir. Do you also read other books on your own, so to speak? That is, books not on the required list for your English courses? Yes, sir. Have you ever read a book called The Seven Minutes, by J.J. Jadway? Yes, sir. I have. From cover to cover? Every word of it? - Yes, sir. - What was your reaction to the book? Objection! The witness's reaction to the book is highly immaterial. No evidence has been produced by the prosecution showing this witness to be a literary expert. Mr Griffith's reaction is highly irrelevant, speculative, and having nothing whatsoever to do with the merits of this trial. Mr Barrett, I must warn you against making speeches for the jury's benefit. I find the prosecutor's line of questioning to be highly probative and material to the issue of whether or not The Seven Minutes is obscene. The jury is admonished to disregard defence counsel's argument before the court. You may proceed, Mr Duncan, hopefully without any interruptions from Mr Barrett. Thank you, Your Honour. Jerry, what was your reaction to the reading of The Seven Minutes? - I was upset. - What do you mean, upset? I was mixed up inside. All mixed up. I couldn't sleep. Did you go to school the next day? Yes, but I cut some of my late afternoon classes. - Why? - I had my mind on that book. I kept it in my car, and I drove around for a while, and I found a lonely road up in the hills and I re-read parts of the book. Can you recall what sections you re-read? I don't remember exactly... Some of the first chapter, the first of the seven minutes in the story. I read that several times. - What was in those pages? - I don't remember exactly. If I may refresh your memory of that part, Jerry... "She is lying naked, and she thinks of the statues of Priapus "that stood on some of the streets of ancient Greece. "Statues consisting of a bust of a bearded man "set on a stone basalt block, "and out of the centre of this statue there projected a giant phallus..." I object to the prosecutor's leading and suggestive reading pointedly out of context. Mr Duncan should be conversant with the fact that a work, whether it be writing or motion pictures, must be considered as a whole, particularly when the question of obscenity hangs in the balance. Mr Barrett, my patience is stretched to the breaking point. The counsel for the prosecution's reading is clearly and obviously foundational, and will be followed by a proper question. You will continue reading, Mr Duncan. Thank you, Your Honour. "And out of the centre of this statue there projected a giant phallus," and then Kathleen thinks how lucky she is, and she stared at the unnamed hero of the book, and the first of her seven minutes begins. Now Jerry, do you recognise that as the part you re-read several times? - Yes, sir. - Did you feel at the time - it was artistic writing? - I didn't think about the writing. Face the court, Jerry. Do you feel the author was trying nothing more than excite the reader? Your Honour, I'm sorry, but I must object to the District Attorney's constant leading and suggestive questioning. This examination is highly inflammatory and I ask to approach the bench to discuss the relevance of this one-sided interrogation. Mr Barrett, I find the prosecutor's questioning to be quite pertinent. The bench will not tolerate any more interference from you. If you persist, you'll be held in contempt of court. Now let us proceed with the trial. Thank you, Your Honour. Have the court reporter repeat the last question. You are instructed to do so. - Question by Mr Duncan. - (Loud shuffling of papers) Did you feel that the author was trying to do anything more - than excite the reader? - N0. Did this passage and other passages excite you? Yes, sir. In what way did this excitement manifest itself? (Suspenseful music) Physically. I wanted to have a girl. You mean you wanted to have sexual intercourse with a girl? - Yes, sir. - With some particular girl, ' ¬∞‚ÄúS' any girl? ' Any girl. - What did you do next? - It was night time. I drove to the club, and I drank a couple of beers. There was this one chick, she looked just like what I imagined Kathleen... (Elmo) Kathleen, the heroine of The Seven Minutes? - Right. Anyhow, I offered her a ride. - By "her", do you mean Sheri Moore? Right. S0 I drove her to her apartment, and walked upstairs. And when she opened the door, I pushed her inside. - You did this how'? - I had a knife. I see. Did she undress? She was scared, so she undressed. - What happened next? - I don't remember. It went kind of crazy like it wasn't my own mind any more. Like it was Jadway's mind. Please continue, Jerry. - I forced myself on her. - Did she resist? - Yes. - But you violated her anyway? I didn't know what I was doing. Did you think of The Seven Minutes at all? When she was naked, yes. Then I don't remember after that. Except that I did it. I couldn't help doing it. And during the course of the sex act, Miss Moore was injured? It was after, when I was trying to dress. She tried to hit me, and get my knife. I don't remember which. And lthink... somehow she slipped and fell. It was an accident. Did you know Miss Moore was unconscious? I don't remember if I knew it or not. I only knew she had a roommate who might be coming back soon, so ljust left. I felt miserable. I... lwanted to kill myself. Because this wasn't me, what I had done. It wasn't my fault. I didn't know what I was doing. Have you ever in your life... - ...behaved this way before? - N0, sir. Do you definitely feel the obscene pages in that book inflamed you until you were impelled to commit a criminal act? Yes, sir. I can't explain any other reason for it. Jerry, I want you to listen to me, and listen to me carefully. From your own experience, do you believe there's a cause and effect... now understand me, cause and effect relationship between pornographic books and violent acts of crime? I... I only know... only know what happened. It happened to me. (Choking sobs) No further questions, Your Honour. The defence has no questions, Your Honour. - (incredulous hubbub) - Mr Barrett, you mean you wish to reserve your cross-examination for laten'? I mean, as far as the defence is concerned, the witness may be permanently excused. We will take a two-hour recess for lunch. (Bangs gavel) Hey, Barrett, why didn't you cross-examine the kid? No comment. Have you thrown in the towel, Mr Barrett? No comment. "If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen." - Was the heat too hot for you? - Fuck off. (Clay) You still haven't answered me. What the hell happened back there? (Mike) I traded off the cross-examination of Jerry Griffith for the examination of the legendary Cassie McGraw. (Clay) You mean she's alive? (Mike) She's very much alive and, what's more, - we have an opportunity to use her. - Who'd she make a deal with? (Mike) Maggie Russell. Cassie read about the trial in the paper, wrote to Frank Griffith in defence of Jadway, Maggie intercepted the postcard and kept it hidden for two weeks. I'm gonna see it later today. (Clay) You gotta be kidding! You mean, you traded away Jerry for something scrawled on a postcard? Something you haven't even seen? And what if the whole trade was a con job engineered by Maggie on behalf of the Griffith family? - (Mike) Hey, I've got faith in Maggie! - OK, man, you keep the faith. (Mike) Look at the other side of it, man. Cassie McGraw for the defence would be a sensation. (Clay) When is Maggie supposed to turn over this postcard? (Mike) Some time later today. S0 you'd better call the sequence from the start. ...and to the best of your recollection, you have not omitted any pertinent facts surrounding your arrest at the Argus Book Store by Sergeant Kellog of the County Sheriffs Office? - N0, sir. - Your witness. Were you previously arrested under the terms of the California Penal Code, Section 311.2? The section stating that everyone who knowingly distributes obscene material - is guilty of a misdemeanour? - Yes. - Did you plead not guilty? - N0. Did you plead guilty of selling obscene material? Yes, but only on the advice of my attorney. He said if I pleaded guilty I would get a lighter sentence. - But you admitted guilt? - Yes, I did. - Did you pay a fine? - Yes. - Did you go tojail? - N0. The sentence was suspended. Are you aware that a second offence - is not a misdemeanour, but a felony? - Yes. Are you cognisant of the fact that you can go to jail for a year - and be fined up to $25,000? - Yes, I am. Are you aware that the publisher, the Sanford House, pandered The Seven Minutes with this garish poster prominently displayed in front of the Argus Book Store? But there were other quotes on similar advertising, that described it as a distinguished work of art. No further questions, Your Honour. When Sanford House contracted for The Seven Minutes, were you worried about it violating existing obscenity laws? Not really, because I considered the book to be beautiful and touching. It's too well done to appeal to s0meone's prurient interest alone. Do you consider the book to be beyond the customary limits of candour by contemporary community standards? Certainly not. In fact, it's relatively mild by today's standards. When you consider that motion pictures and stage plays offer nudity, copulation, oral-genital love, masturbation, homosexuality, lesbianism... community standards have radically changed. Your witness, Mr Duncan. Mr Sanford, I have before me news clippings from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, which note the shaky financial position of Sanford House in the last two years. Are these news accounts substantially true? Yes . - (Elmo) In short, since you took over... - (Quietly) Excuse me, Mr Barrett. Miss Maggie Russell wants you to meet her right away. - (Elmo) ...as it has in the past. - Did she say where? She said you'd know. (Sanford) That depends on what you mean by "doing well". Uh... it is true that the firm's book sales, uh... have gone dovlm... (Elmo) Perhaps you were desperate enough to ignore your fathefis previous good taste, and tried to save your position in the firm by publishing an obscene book? - (Tyres screech) - What's going on? I've made a real mess of everything! Uncle Frank heard from Yerkes that we were seeing each other. Apparently he's known of our relationship for some time, but my rising to your defence over Jerry's well-being flipped him out. He told me to pack up and leave, he took my key and waited until I was outside on the front drive before slamming the door. S0 I lugged my things over here from across the street. And the postcard from Cassie McGraw - is still in his desk? - I'm sorry. Now you had to give up your key, right? The key to the front door, yes. But not the one to the rear service porch. Then we're just going to have to sweat him out. Because I gotta get my hands on that postcard. - Mike, my bags! - (Brakes squeal) - (Maggie) What time is it? - 9:15. (Maggie) Wait, the light went out. There's Uncle Frank, coming out the door. (Car door shuts, engine starts) In we go. (Music becomes more dramatic) Oh, damn it! (Tyres squeal) Get it fast. I'll go out in the street. (Brakes squeal) What the hell are you doing in my driveway? You could have got us both killed! Look, sir, I'm sorry. I came by to see Miss Russell, and... Well, Miss Russell doesn't live here any more. Now you get your lousy crate out of my driveway. I oughta put guys like you away. You son of a bitch, what the hell are you doing here? Spying on me and my son? Come on, get out of the car and say something, you bastard. You're not in court now. Oh, I'd really like to clobber you, but you're not suckering me into that. Now you get your ass outta here. If you're still snooping around after I've parked my car, I'm gonna kick the living hell out of you. Then I'll turn you over to the cops for prowling. How does that grab ya? (Both engines start) (Tyres squeal) (Maggie gasps) That was a close call. (Mike) Let's get the hell out of here before I get my ass kicked. (Tyres squeal) Well? It's... beautiful. If Cassie McGraw backs up in court what she says in this postcard, the defence finally has a star witness. Now, where can I take you before I catch the next plane to Chicago? I was hoping you'd take me home. - Home? - With you? (Lush, romantic music) If Jadway were alive today, he'd be in his late 50s or early 60s. This woman is at least 15 or 20 years older. Like all the old people in this sanitarium, I never think of Katie in terms of years. That reminds me of something. As long as I've been here, and that's going on five years, Katie's been getting flowers. Once a year, always on her birthday. - Who sends Cassie the flowers? - I don't know. They're wired from Ryan's Flowers, in Oakwood, California. (Phone rings) - Hello? - Hi, Maggie. Mike, I was praying it would be you. Have you heard? I mean about Sheri Moore? She died in her sleep. Yeah, ljust finished reading the story. - Are things any better in Chicago? - It couldn't be worse. Cassie McGraw will never speak on the witness stand. The poor woman's senile. - What a lousy break. - She has moments when she's lucid, like when she wrote the postcard, but today wasn't one of them. I'm awfully sorry, Mike. All that trouble for nothing. - Chicago may not be a total loss. - How do you mean? She receives roses every year on her birthday. A standing order from Ryan's Flowers. I called Clay, he's gonna check on it first thing tomorrow. Mike, I might be able to help you. When I was working as Frank Griffith's secretary, - we dealt exclusively with that florist. - S0? Why don't you let me get in touch with them? I'd love to help. Miss Cumberland, I'll bet you're wondering why I'm here. Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. Well, the Griffiths have a lot to do with it. I'm terribly concerned about Jerry Griffith. You know, the boy who's involved in the obscenity trial? Yes. I watched it on the news last night. It might sound strange to you, but one of my good friends, and I trust him implicitly, is Michael Barrett, the defence attorney in the case. He's a very attractive young man indeed. He genuinely believes that Jadway's The Seven Minutes is not obscene. Anyway, he's been racing all over the country trying to find witnesses who knew Jadway or who had some insight into his motives. He just visited with Cassie McGraw in Chicago. Oh, really? - You're familiar with Ryan's Flowers? - Well, yes. - Mike asked me to check their records. - Did he? I was surprised to learn that, for the past ten years, you have been paying for Cassie McGraw's birthday flowers. - How enterprising of you. - How well did you know Cassie McGraw'? Cassie McG raw was my private secretary when I lived and worked in Paris, ooh, 35 years ago. At that time, she was my only friend. Very few people know about Cassie, or about any of my life at the time, for that matter. Much of it was not terribly pleasant. Through the years, I've managed to keep it concealed. But why? You know of my longstanding friendship with the Griffiths. Especially Frank's late wife. It was difficult to hide my contempt of his behaviour toward his son Jerry. Now, it's my turn to stand up and be counted. (Raunchy, va-va-voom music) Thank you, Baby Doll. It's in the bag. We don't even need the chippie's creaking. Elmo can't buy that newspaper and the TV exposure. It also opens up a whole new can of peas. We now have a case of murder one as well. We're gonna anticipate a probability factor of at least 90% for conviction. Whose? Jerry's? I think the Griffith name has been muck-raked enough. Oh, relax, Frank. It's not your boy that's on trial. It's that obscene book, together with that Ben Fremont, that purveyor of filth. The slut's death is just icing on the cake. Frankly, I am more than a little bit concerned at the turn of events. It's a brand new ball game with Sheri Moore's death. Well, if it's any consolation, there's the closing argument Mike dictated about four this morning. Let's pick up on it. It might give us a shot in the arm. (Mike) Supreme Court Justice Douglas once said "The idea of using censors to bar thoughts of sex is dangerous. "A person without sex thoughts is abnormal. "Sex thoughts may induce sex practices that... "...make for better marital relations. "Sex thoughts that make love more atiractive "certainly should not be outlawed. lf the illicit is included, "that should make no constitutional difference." Your Honour, I call Constance Cumberland to the stand. (Gasps of astonishment) Please raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - I do. - State your name for the record. - Constance Cumberland. - Please be seated. Miss Cumberland, what is your present occupation? I'm an actress. I have been an actress for some 35 years, in motion pictures and most recently on television. How do you occupy yourself away from camera? Well, if you mean what organisations do I belong to, I'm a working member of the League for Women Voters, the Reiss-Davis Centre for emotionally disturbed children, and occasionally I've given my public support to the Strength Through Decency League. Because, like anyone else with concern about today's society, I'm against pornography. Mainly because of the way it appeals to the young people who aren't mature enough to understand its implications. Did you ever write and publish any books? - I did. - Were they works of fiction? Some sceptics probably suggested as much... (Laughter) ...but I consider my autobiography to be a work of complete truth. What I mean is, everything that I published was honest. That doesn't mean I published everything. (Laughter) Are you acquainted with the classical and modern fiction? As a reader, yes I am. Classical and modern. And also as an actress. I wouldn't want to bore the court with my credits, but... Have you ever read a novel entitled The Seven Minutes, by J.J. Jadway? - I have, sir. - Have you read it more than once? I've read it many, many times. How recently have you read the book in its entirety? As recently as last night. Are you familiar with section 311.2 of the California Penal Code? Iam. Do you know that The Seven Minutes is being charged as obscene matter under that section of the Code? I do know that. Do you consider The Seven Minutes to be an obscene book? Just a moment, Miss Cumberland. Your Honour, I object to defence counsel's question. No foundation has been laid to establish Miss Cumberland's qualifications to render such an opinion. With all due respect to the acting abilities and other impressive credentials possessed by Miss Cumberland, I cannot imagine what bearing her opinion on the merits of this book could possibly have upon the proceedings. Your Honour, I would like to approach the bench. Both attorneys shall approach the bench. Mr Barrett, I'm concerned with your examination of Miss Cumberland. It appears you are seeking to elicit from this witness an opinion which she is not entitled to give. Mr Duncan has properly interposed an objection which I mean to sustain. Your Honour, if I may interrupt forjust a moment. I assure you that Miss Cumberland's testimony is critical to the defence case. I can... Your Honour, I feel defence counsel is testing the court's patience. Let him who is without sin cast the first stone. Don't you come on strong with me. Gentlemen, will you restrain yourselves from this bickering? Now, Mr Barrett, I have the greatest admiration for Miss Cumberland as an actress, but I fail to see what credentials she possesses which enables her to render an opinion concerning The Seven Minutes, unless she is a qualified literary expert, and apparently she is not, because you have not qualified her as such. Therefore she cannot give an expert opinion. Your Honour, it is very... Just a moment, Mr Duncan. I want to hear from the defence. I represent to you as an officer of the court that you will find this testimony to be extremely relevant and material to the def... Let him make an offer of proof as to the nature of this so-called material. Do you have an offer of proof to make? Your Honour, if I'm forced to make an offer of proof at this time, the court is requiring me to disclose my defence to the prosecution, in violation of my client's constitutional rights. This I respectfully refuse to do. If the court will just bear with me, permit me a few more questions, you'll readily see the relevance. All right, all right. But I'm warning you, Mr Barrett. If the testimony in fact is inadmissible or highly prejudicial to the prosecution I will take strong measures to deal with this. - Your Honour, may l...? - Not at this time, Mr Duncan. If the evidence is not relevant and material, you may move to strike the testimony at the appropriate time. Now let's proceed. Miss Cumberland, do you consider The Seven Minutes to be an obscene book? No, I do not. I consider it to be a highly moral book. Do you believe the author of this work was pandering to prurient interest, to a shameful or morbid interest in nudity and sex in writing this book, as the state charges? To which I object on the grounds that this witness is not qualified to answer the question. Mr Duncan, I believe your objection to be well taken, but the court believes that the defence is entitled to some leeway in this area. Objection overruled. Mr Barrett, will you please reframe the question? Miss Cumberland, do you believe the author was in fact pandering to a shameful and morbid interest in nudity and sex? I know for a fact that that author was not pandering to prurient interest. Your Honour, I move to strike from the record Miss Cumberland's conclusion and conjecture that the author was not in fact pandering to prurient interest. Obviously, this witness could have no personal knowledge of the authofis true intentions. Mr Barrett, I indicated that I would give you leeway. However if you don't immediately get to your point, the court will sustain its own objection to your questions. Very well, Your Honour. I will proceed directly to the point. Miss Cumberland, you stated that the book The Seven Minutes was not in fact written to appeal to prurient interest. May I enquire, how do you know'? Because I'm intimatedly acquainted with the circumstances surrounding the creation and the publication of The Seven Minutes. (Excited murmuring) (Gavel banging repeatedly) (Judge) Miss Cumberland, will you explain to the jurors and the court how you came by this intimate knowledge? Gladly. No person alive was closer or better acquainted with J.J. Jadway than I am. Miss Cumberland, are you implying that you were present in Paris when J.J. Jadway wrote The Seven Minutes? I'm saying that lwas in Paris when the book was written. Do you know the author's motivations for writing it? To which I object. The question calls for conclusion and speculation. Miss Cumberland could not possibly have any personal knowledge of the authofis true motivations for writing The Seven Minutes. Mr Duncan, we are getting on with this matter if it's the last thing we do. You will recall the court asked Miss Cumberland to explain to thejury how she has intimate knowledge of the circumstances under which The Seven Minutes was written. Now the court will not tolerate any more interference of Mr Barrett's questioning along these lines. Objection overruled. Mr Barrett, will you proceed and ask another question? Thank you, Your Honour. Miss Cumberland, you are familiar with the prosecution's testimony. Does this first-hand knowledge which you possess confirm or contradict the testimony given here by the people's witnesses? My information about the real Jadway, and the real purpose in writing and publishing this book, completely contradicts the evidence so far presented in this court. You do understand that the previous witnesses were sworn, gave their testimony under oath and risked facing a charge of perjury if they lied? They did not lie. They simply did not tell the truth, merely because they were ignorant of the truth. Let me explain. Everything heard in this courtroom, until now, about J.J. Jadway, and I am completely fluent with all of the testimony, has been the purest fiction. And this fiction was deliberately planned and perpetrated by the author, for reasons involving the author's private life. Let me go directly to the salient point at hand. You indicated in earlier testimony that you had published your own autobiography, which was a best-seller as I recall. Have you ever written or published any other books? Yes, I have. How many other books? One book. Was this book published under the name of Constance Cumberland? No, it was not. It was published under a pseudonym. (Suspenseful music) Can you tell the court the title of that book and the pseudonym under which you wrote it? - The book was The Seven Minutes... - (Gasps of astonishment) - ...by J.J. Jadway. (Hubbub in court) - I am J.J. Jadway. - (Pencil snaps loudly) (Dramatic music) - (Gavel banging) - Order in court! Order! Order! Miss Cumberland, the court has already heard The Seven Minutes read aloud. S0 we might more clearly determine the significance of what we have already heard, would you mind telling us the themes and symbols that you tried to convey in writing the book? May I have a glass of water, please? Thank you. (Clock ticking loudly) The Seven Minutes is composed of seven chapters, each chapter representing one minute in the mind of this young woman, Kathleen, who is lying on a bed having sexual intercourse with an unnamed, unseen man. It begins with a description of her thoughts and feelings for her male bed partner. Kathleen's mind reacts to the coupling on two levels. On the first, she records her immediate physical sensations, and on the second, inspired by her gradually mounting passion, she recollects fragments of sensual experiences from her youthful past with three actual men in her life who had been her lovers. The thrust of the novel is drawn out of the fact that Kathleen decides to accept one of these men as her lifetime mate: the one she had taken to her bed this night, the very one who shares her seven minutes. Not till the last page, while she is gasping her love for him in the final throes of her passion, does she call out and reveal the name of the one she has chosen. You see, through her vast sexual experience, she has managed to liberate a sensitive but potentially impotent man, the man she honestly loved. In writing The Seven Minutes I finally found freedom myself, just as I had hoped I might liberate others from fear and guilt and shame. Do you know of any other readers for which it has performed this service? The words in The Seven Minutes freed a young man only today, and enabled him to confide to me the truth about himself. A truth he has told no other person, until now. Jerry Griffith was not driven to commit rape by reading this book. He did not try to violate Sheri Moore against her will. He tried, but at Sheri's own invitation, but he failed then, as he had always failed before, and as he would fail today. Because, you see, Jerry Griffith was then, was before, and even today is still sexually impotent. He is incapable of attaining an erection. Miss Cumberland, did the verdict for acquittal surprise you? What surprised me more was the very fact that I was able to reveal myself in court. There was testimony about your supposed suicide. You look pretty good to me right now, so obviously you're alive and kicking. Did you ever really try to kill yourself? (Constance) Well, that whole incredible story was arranged by a poet friend of mine, a loyal and dear friend named Sean O'Flanagan. It was simple enough for him to write and plant the obituary of J.J. Jadway. Cassie McGraw arranged a private memorial service for Jadway. I found it wiser to be somewhere else. Miss Cumberland, what made you decide to renounce the Jadway identity? Well, I had an offer from a Hollywood producer, someone I had met in Paris, to appear in The Go/d-Diggers of 1938. Anyway, I went to Hollywood, made Gold-Diggers, and you know the rest. (Maggie laughing) Be nice. You won. I'll be right back. Oh, Mr Barrett, I don't know if you heard me with all the noise after the verdict, but I did congratulate you. I appreciate that, sir. You won the preliminary. You got The Seven Minutes off the hook. But the main event is still murder one, and I intend to prosecute Perkins to the full limit of the law. Jerry Griffith has a debt as well. As an accomplice he shares the responsibility for the crime. He won't run from that. When he has his day in court I'll be standing right next to him. You proved that one of my witnesses perjured himself and that another one unwittingly lied. But you didn't prove, at least not to me, that this filthy book belongs in a decent household. And Jadway or Cumberland, I still believe The Seven Minutes is obscene and harmful and should have been found guilty. And as for the author of that perverted book, Constance Cumberland stands as a black stain on our society. Well, you're entitled to your opinion... Barrett, such books are dangerous and should not be published, because they can hurt immature and disturbed adults. Even worse, they can over-stimulate a child before he's ready to accept his sex thoughts as natural and drive him into damaging sexual fantasies. In other words, Mr Duncan, all literature and all ideas should be aimed at satisfying the twelve-year-old reader. You're a pitiful hypocrite and a political opportunist to boot. You spout your clever rhetoric about God, mother and country and yet you connive and scheme without regard to anyone but yourself. It amazes me that an intelligent man cannot direct his energies into what is good for the community he's supposed to protect. Instead, he spends his time racing off to court seeking a ban on those things he arbitrarily feels is bad for us. You've got your goddamn nerve! You win one lousy case, you think you're F. Lee Bailey. Let me tell you one thing: as long as there are books like The Seven Minutes or anything else I feel jeopardises the moral fibre of this community, I'll keep fighting them! - (Tyres squeal) - Fair warning. But as long as you keep strong-arming yourself ahead, I'll be fighting you. (Mike) Maggie, if you knew all along about Jerry's sexual problem, if you knew he was incapable of rape, why the hell didn't you say something? Because I wasn't all that certain that he was impotent on the night of the sa-cal/ed rape. (Mike) Where did Jerry and Miss Cumberland finally get together? (Maggie) In your house, yesterday, while you were still in Chicago. I took the chance of pretending to him that I knew the truth about his night with Sheri Moore. At that point, Jerry broke down and confessed everything. Miss Cumberland was really touched. She said if she could persuade Jerry to stand up and confess the truth then she herself might find the courage to do the same in court. Maggie, you're beautiful. Just beautiful. Listen, if you're really so grateful, how about a little victory celebration? You know I don't drink anything stronger than Coke. And I also know you've given up cigarettes and cyclamates because you're only thirty and want to live to be a hundred. I was thinking of something a lot healthier. (Car engine revs up) "To Michael Barrett, I salute you on your deserved victory, "and I recommend that you enjoy this vintage wine "in the spirit that it is given." Beware of Greeks bearing gifts. "L also recommend to you the wisdom of Charles Lamb. - "To wit, he is..." - ...no lawyer who cannot take two sides. "When you have time, I would like to interest you in..." ...my side of the coin. "You could find it extremely profitable." Who knows, you could be Senatorial material. "Best, Luther Yerkes." Luther Yerkes. Young lady, I feel it's only fair to tell you that what I'm thinking about doing is against the law. And what are you thinking about doing? I can't tell you that. It's against the law too. Suddenly, I got this overpowering urge to break the damn law myself. Well, we could both get into a lot of trouble. I know a very good lawyer. Aside from notoriety, what else do you want out of my life? Would you believe the next seven minutes? (Clock ticking) (Soft rock ballad) Seven minutes filled with pleasure Moments made of love will take you On a sweet excursion By wayof Your memory Suddenly you find You cross the boundfies that were once forbidden AII at once you have a better view Of the morning You in the morning You in the morning
