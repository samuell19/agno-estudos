Yeah. Come run with me now The sky is the color of blue You've never even seen in the eyes of your lover Oh, my heart is aching We're coming to the edge Running on the water Coming through the fog, your sons and daughters Let the river run Let all the dreamers wake... No lunch. I got speech class. What do you need speech class for? You talk fine. I'll pick you up at 5:00. We'll ride back together. I can't. I've got emerging market seminar at 5:30. It's your birthday. Can't they emerge without you just this once? What time is my surprise party? What? Come on. I'm supposed to have you home at 7:00. I'll cut out early and be home at 7:15. All right. Thank you very much. Let the river run Let all the dreamers wake the nation Come the New... Hi, Tess. Morning. Jerusalem Morning, Tess. Morning. Hello, Tess. Hi. I've got a little secret I want to tell you. [Telephone Rings] [ring] Mr. Turkel's line. Um... Who's calling, please? Um... Hold on a moment. Mr. Lutz. Um... Hold on a second, all right? I wouldn't do that to you, so relax and tell me how many you want. [Knocking] Mr. Turkel? Mr. Turkel! Huh? Um... Mr. Alagesh... Hi. Mr. Alagesh is real anxious to talk to you. Couldn't you get him to hold? You got him in Denatech, the one I said go short on, and it's fine, but he don't want to hear it from a secretary. - There's no paper. - What? There is no goddamn paper. Get me some. Thanks. You're very kind. Oh! He's short on Denatech at 18, and he'll be right here. You see Denatech closing? 171/8. Come Monday, I bet it's 16. How you figure? They went public at 23 with one product... plaque-removing mouthwash. You get this glob of plaque you got to spit out. No one ever got rich overestimating what people want to taste. Maybe. Before I run, Tess, I have good news and bad news. The straight shot, Tessie, is, they turned you down for the entree program again. Why? Did all we could, Tessie. You're up against Harvard graduates. What do you got? Some night school, some secretarial time on your sheet? Christians and lions, Tess. The good news? Dave has a friend. Bob in Arbitrage. They're looking for hungry down there. Really? Hungry's the name of the game down there. Bob's looking for a new assistant. He wants to meet you for a drink. This isn't another setup? Sh... Do I look like a pimp? Bob says he's looking for hungry, I think to myself, "Tess." The rest is up to you. Bob in Arbitrage. Bob Speck. Extension 256. Expecting your call. Go get him, Tessie. Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you - You should have told us! Happy birthday, dear Tess Happy birthday to you Thanks. Mick? Ooh ooh ooh ooh Na na na na Da-a-um Mmm Surprise! Hey! Happy birthday! Happy birthday. What is this? You look great. Come here. You know, Mick, just once I could go for a sweater or some earrings... a present I could wear outside of this apartment. So... [Clears Throat] is this where you usually meet for drinks? Mmm. This is a big week. It's a super week. We are celebrating! So, Arbitrage... Talk about adrenaline, huh? What do you think is the most important quality... for a great arbitrager? We'll go through all that at the hotel. - The hotel? - Yeah. The company's suite at the Ritz Carlton. When it's empty, we boys get it on a bonus basis. Woo! We're going to party! Oh, allow me. I'm so sorry. Hey! Bob, please! I'm sorry. I get carried away. Mmm... Arbitrage has this "introduction-to" tape for the business schools. Why don't we put it in, and if you have questions... That would be great. Thanks. It's the wrong tape, unless you... Bob, you're not seriously looking for a new assistant, are you? Well, not exactly at this moment. But I'm always looking for new blood. I am hungry, Bob, but not that hungry. - I wouldn't put it that way. - I would. Would you pull over, please? What are you doing? No. Ha ha ha! Party, Bob. Ah! Hello, Tess. You're late, Tess. Yo, David! Bitch! You got to see this to believe it. Hey, take it easy! Tess, Tess, Tess... I know. You don't get ahead by calling your boss a pimp. Well, he is. This is the third time in six months I had to place you. It wasn't my fault. Where have I heard that before? Ruth, I'm 30 years old. Took me five years of night school, but I got my degree with honors. I know I could do a job. You ask any of my bosses, even Lutz, - if Tess McGill hasn't called a few. - You ask 'em. They won't sing your praises, Tess. Here's something for you... Transferring down from Boston, Mergers and Acquisitions. Name is Parker. Starts Monday. You go home and cool off. O.K. Tess, this is the last time I can help you. Four strikes, you're out. Hi. Tess McGill of Katharine Parker's office. It's the desk at the end of the aisle. Look at this. I'm telling you... Hi. I can't believe it. [Elevator Bell Rings] Shh! Shh! Shh! Hi. I'm Katharine Parker. You must be Tess. Hi. Oh, great bunny! I don't usually have a bunny on my desk. It was my birthday a few days ago. Mine's next Tuesday. How old? 30. Really? I'll be 30 next Tuesday. We're practically twins. Except that I'm older. Just barely. I've never worked for somebody who was younger than me before, or for a woman. There's a first time for everything. That's not gonna be a problem, is it, Tess? No... no. Pour us a couple of coffees and come inside. I'm light, no sugar. The stock is 38. The tender's at 56. - [Knock On Door] - Come in. What do we do about that? I just checked my three. What are yours? Uh-huh. Yeah, I have that one. Well, I think he's in an underwater position. That's our first and second call. Then we'll see where we are. I'll count the minutes. Bye. Thanks. So, Tess, a few ground rules. The way I look at it, you are my link with the outside world. People's impression of me starts with you. You're tough when it's warranted, accommodating when you can be, accurate, punctual, and never make a promise you can't keep. I'm never on another line. I'm in a meeting. I consider us a team. As such, we have a uniform... simple, elegant, impeccable. "Dress shabbily, they notice the dress. dress impeccably, they notice the woman." Coco Chanel. Um... How do I look? You look terrific. You might want to rethink the jewelry. I want your input. I welcome ideas. I like to see hard work rewarded. It's a two-way street on my team. Am I making myself clear? Yes, Katharine. And call me Katharine. O.K. So, let's get to work, shall we? This department's profile last year was damn pitiful. Our team has got its work cut out for it. O.K., thanks. Damn! I forgot my pills again! Did you hear about that shot they got in Europe? They give it to the women in their arm, and it's good for five years. The damn pills, I'm always forgetting them. - I thought you might like this. - Oh, thank you. Tess, would you come in and bring a notebook? They've sold off the paper and printing divisions. They sell distribution too, we're talking scorched earth. Come on in. Tess, this is Ginny. Ginny, Tess. I'm throwing a cocktail thing to introduce myself to the department. Ginny has some great ideas. Will you jot them down? - Sure. - The caterer is Acme Eats. You can get the number from information. They do the usual hors d'oeuvres and such. The Raging Bull has a bartender service. The liquor store on Broadway and Liberty delivers. Got that, Bess? Tess. Yeah, if that's the way you want to go. You have another idea? I was reading in W about dim sum, little Chinese dumplings. A restaurant on Mott Street does them for cocktail parties. I just love those little dumplings. It might be more fun than the usual tidbits. I have it on my desk. I could get it. - You read W? - I read a lot of things. You never know where big ideas could come from. Well, I guess you're right, if dumplings can be considered a big idea. That ought to get you started. Ginny, thank you so much. - Back to the gold mines. - Right. You'll set those up? Right away. Dim sum, Tess. I like it, contribution-wise. Keep it up. The chief says, "We will respect your wish. "We will give you an honorable death. But first, Kiki." Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you. Dim sum? Uh, yes, yes, yes. Now, listen. You work with him. Thank you. Keep with him. So come on, Katharine, what do you say? Jim, the man who spends every weekend in August glued to his desk knows I can't sneak out of my own party. I'll tell you what, though. Get me in on the Southeast Air divestiture plan, I'll buy you a drink... a bottle of Crystal, two straws. Deal? Okey-dokey. Dim sum? Hi. Thank you. What a slob. You were so smooth with him. - I probably would have... - Never burn bridges. Today's junior prick, tomorrow's senior partner. So how do you think the party's going? Pretty well, I think. Should I stop serving now? Better make one more round. I'd love to help you, but you can't busy the quarterback with passing out the Gatorade. Arnie, my hero, you've come. Yeah? Um, I have an idea, and you said I could come to you. Shoot. Well, you know how Trask Industries has been looking to buy into broadcasting? Something about the department is... Working on it. Yeah. I've been following it myself, and I suddenly thought, "Radio." Trask is looking for television stations. Well, so is every Tom, Dick and Harry. My idea is that they get their feet wet in radio and build from there. It's not as glamorous as jumping into TV, but it's a solid start, and there's more of them for sale. It would solve Trask's problem with Japanese competitors trying to take him over. FCC forbids foreign ownership of radio as well as TV. Interesting. You've been, um... following this, you say? Yeah. No chance you overheard it, say, um... on the elevator? No. No way. Somewhere? It's my idea. Good. Good. Discuss it with anyone else? Nope. You think that there's something there? I'll think it through for you. Leave me your notes. I'll have a look-see. O.K. Uh... I've been trying to get into the entree program. This would be a big push. If anything happens... Absolutely, Tess. Two-way street, remember? Yeah. Thank you. It's just... It's so exciting. I mean, she takes me seriously. I think it's because... I know you hate when I say this, but I think it's because she's a woman. There's none of that chasing-around-the-desk crap. It's like she wants to be my mentor, which is what I needed. I feel like I'm finally getting somewhere, Mick. Tess, that's great, but let's step on it... or the pizza's gonna freeze, honey. Maybe we could all go out sometime... you know, dinner in the city. You would like her, I think. God, remember when all you had to do was a few buckles? Yep. Those were the days. I called the inn. All they can give you is a ground-floor single in the new wing. Did you tell them it was me? Well... I said Parker. Helmut, hier ist Katharine Parker. [Speaking German] Ciao. It's this tower room with a canopy bed and a fireplace big enough to stand in. Perfect. Everything's in place. For what? The man I've been seeing for a while. I think he's it, and this could be the weekend we decide. He said there was something very important he wanted to discuss with me. - I think he's gonna pop the question. - You do? I think so. We're in the same city. I've indicated that I'm receptive to an offer, I've cleared June, and I am, after all, me. Well, what if he doesn't pop the question? I really don't think that's a variable. Tess, you know, you don't get anywhere in this world by waiting for what you want to come to you. You make it happen. Watch me, Tess. Learn from me. Oh, I ran your Trask radio idea by some of our people. It seems Trask is dead set on television. It wasn't out in left field. I really like the idea. Keep plugging. Bring me your ideas. We'll see what we can do. Thank you, Katharine. Tess. Tess, look at me. Who makes it happen? I do. Who does? I do. I make it happen. That's right. Only then do we get what we deserve. Aah... [Telephone Rings] [Ring] Miss Parker's office. Hi, Katharine. You what? Broke it skiing. They can't move me for weeks. This is what I need you to do. Water plants, O.K. Cable comes on Friday, right. Hey, easy with the leg. Quit staring up my gown. I'm staying at my parents' house, and the housekeeper is in Barbados for a month. Wouldn't you know it? What a mess. You need to let in the flower man and the cleaning lady. The entrance code for the front door is... [Whispering] It's 7-5-4-3-2000. I know there's more, but I can't think of what. Go through my desk calendar. There's a bunch of invitations to be RSVP'd. I know I'm asking an awful lot, Tess. I don't know what else to do. I need you to take over. O.K. Bye. [Click] Mmm Mmm mmm mmm mmm Ooh ooh ooh ooh Na na na na Da-a-um Mmm Ah ah ah ah Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh [Katharine] Regarding those horrid little knickknacks from the Alberts... Dear Eleanor and Gary, Thank you for the beautiful salt and pepper shakers. Not only are they the perfect housewarming gift, but it was dear of you to think of me so far away. Dear Sister, It's been eight years since we said good-bye to Wellesley. Of course, we never really say good-bye. On behalf of... the Alumni Giving Fund... Dear Sister... It's been eight years... since we said good-bye to Wellesley. of course, we never really... say good-bye. On behalf of the Alumni Giving Fund, I am writing to you to ask... To ask... To ask... To ask. To ask... I am writing to you to ask... Dear Momo and Ba... Momo and Ba. ...the New York real estate market, looking for a place of my own. Of course, it makes me miss you all terribly, but it will be so lovely to see you when you return from Barbados. Till then, have fun. Much love to you and to Claudette. Love, Kiki. To Jack Trainer, Dewey, Stone & Company, from me, RE Trask Industries radio network acquisition. Um, hard copy on this from the home computer. Do not go through Tess. To Jack Trainer, Dewey, Stone & Company, from me, RE Trask Industries radio network acquisition. Um, hard copy on this from the home computer. Do not go through Tess. Two-way street... And you make it happen. What, no class? No class. Tess, this is not what it looks like. I mean it is, but I can explain. Well, not exactly explain... You snake. Shit. Come on, Tess! I'm sorry! I really am! I love you! Come on! Come back and hit me! Please! [In Nasal Voice] Hello. Mr. Trainer's office, please. [Clears Throat] Hello. Tess McGill calling from Petty-Marsh. May I put her through? Thank you. [Normal Voice] Mr. Trainer? Hi. This is Tess McGill. I work with Katharine Parker over here in Mergers and Acquisitions. I have a proposal that I'd like to discuss with you. Not over the phone, though. Um, I have an opening tomorrow morning at 10:00. O.K. I'll messenger an outline over to you right now. Bye. Whew. Yes, I'm calling for Katharine Parker in regard to your invitation. Miss Parker is out of town, but Miss Tess McGill will be attending in her place. Thank you. Bye. Why does it do that? For cleaning. Are you kidding me? No. What is this thing you're going to, anyway? A closing party for the Minadine-Dalton merger. Dewey-Stone's throwing it, which is where Jack Trainer works. Mix business with pleasure. Fringe times are crucial. Did you snatch her invite? Well, she can't use it. It's important for me to interact with people not as a secretary. But as a total impostor. Right. This is it. It needs some bows or something. No. It's simple, elegant, yet makes a statement. Says to people, confident, a risk-taker, not afraid to be noticed. Then you hit them with your smarts. Here. Shoes. I need shoes. $6,000? It's not even leather! $6,000? $6,000? Cyn... I can't breathe so good. Oh, God, come here. Sit down. Let's see if she's got anything soothing. Valium. In the convenient economy size. You sure? It just chills you ever so slightly. You won't even notice it. Ohh. Are you sure about this? You want to be taken seriously, you need serious hair. Hmm. [Man] I've been telling you this for three weeks. We got 25%. We get another 5%, we've got them by the throat. [Woman] Listen, Trainer, let's grab them by the balls. - Leave our hearts at home. - Cut them off at the knees. They'll be eating out of our hands. What do you say? Anybody thirsty? We need this one, Trainer. You need this one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been looking for you. Why? Do you know me? No, but I promised myself that when I saw you, I would get to know you. You're the first woman I've seen at one of these things that dresses like a woman, not like a woman thinks a man would if he was a woman. Thank you, I guess. What are you doing here? I'm looking for someone myself. His name is Jack Trainer. He works at Dewey-Stone. Do you know if he's here? Why are you looking for him? I have a meeting with him tomorrow, and I thought I might say hello and get a head start. Well, he, uh... just left. Oh. Well, I should be going myself. Well, have a drink with me. I can't. What's your name? No. No names, no business cards, no "You must know so and so." - What is this? - No resumes. Let's just meet like human beings, for once. It's nice to meet you, whatever your name is, but I really do have to go. Please? Please... one drink. O.K., one drink, but I'm buying. O.K., but it's an open bar. Right. I knew that. I meant that if it wasn't, - I would be buying. - Yeah. Tequila gold. Doubles. Tequila. I promised myself that when we met, we'd drink tequila. No Chardonnay, no frog water. Real drinks. Ha ha. Oh. Yeah. These things are usually... so boring. Ha ha ha! I wouldn't know. Power to the people. The little people. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Ha ha! You O.K? I'm fine. I'm just fine. I took a... um, antihistamine before, and it just... makes for a nice little buzz. Oh? I didn't know they let bad girls into these things. Do I look like I don't belong here? No, no, I'm sure you're a real ace at whatever it is that you do do. Damn straight. But how you look... I have a head for business and a bod for sin. Is there anything wrong with that? No. No. Hello! Hi! And I have to go now. Well, I'll come with you. No. Hey, Tess! Uh... Uh... Tess! I need some air. Meet me outside. Thank you. Excuse me, please. Hello? Hi. Hi. Hello. Oh. Where do you live? Hmm? Where do you live? Mmm... park... trees... tall building. 166 Morton, near Hudson. 166 Morton. It might be kind of a mess. The cleaning lady keeps changing... days on me. Anybody's guess. I'm just warning you 'cause... if it's the day before, it could be pretty bad. I don't notice so much myself, but some of the people I've had over have, you know, remarked on it. It's not so bad. Would you... Would you like a nightcap? I guess not. Uh... I guess it's too late for coffee. Hmm. Herb tea? Herb te-- No. I don't have any. It always sounds good when people offer it to me when I'm in your shape. I might have a little brandy, myself. Boy. You sure are pretty. [Television Plays] [Alarm Beeps] [Beeping Stops] [Door Slams] Don't fuck up. Don't fuck up. Don't fuck up. Hi. Tess McGill to see Jack Trainer. May I take your coat? Yes, please. Thank you. Ahem. [Knocks On Door] Gentlemen, Tess McGill. O.K. Miss McGill, I'm Jack Trainer. How are you? This is John Romano and Bernie Kotarka. Sit down, please. Ahem. Coffee? Sure. Milk or sugar? Um, yes, both. Thank you. Ahem. Well, I suppose we should just get right down to it. Is that O.K? Sure. Please. Ahem... I lost my briefcase. In each of the last three quarters, Trask Industries has announced plans to acquire a major market television station, each time unsuccessfully. They've expended time and money fighting off a hostile takeover by one of their Japanese competitors. Ahem. Buying into radio would, in one fell swoop, accomplish two important tasks. It would give Trask a solid base in broadcasting, and because of FCC regulations forbidding foreign ownership of radio stations, it would wipe out the threat of a Japanese takeover. Interesting idea. But I don't like it. Trask has got a lot of cash on their balance sheet. It's one of the big reasons they're a takeover target. A radio station is small potatoes. I can't see them biting. Well, I've already thought of that. I figure that we look for a radio network, one with a real high profile, then with the surplus cash, we implement a major stock repurchase. So Trask is protected, and their stock goes up, and everybody's happy. Or not. Oh, shoot me, just shoot me. Cut that out. They didn't throw you out, did they? Oh, well, they don't exactly have bouncers, you know? They're a little more subtle than that, Cyn. Oh, God, and last night! Yeah, I should have checked the milligrams. Live and learn. Maybe he'll feel sorry for you and make it up by doing your deal. I'm not looking for sympathy, you know? I had a shot at it, you know? Miss Tess McGill. It's him. He's here. Do me a favor. Be me... Be my secretary. Tess... Cyn, please. Do it for me, O.K? Tess! - Hi. - May I help you? Jack Trainer to see Miss McGill. Let's give her a shout, shall we? You decent? A Mr. Jack Trainer to see you, Miss McGill. Thank you, Cynthia. Hold all calls? Yes, thank you. Can I get you anything? Coffee, tea, me? Ha ha ha! Isn't she a riot? That'll be all, Cynthia. Why did you say you weren't you last night? Because I knew what would happen. All Mergers and Acquisitions... no lust and tequila. That was... I mean, that just happened, O.K? I want to make it clear, um... Yes? What did happen, exactly? The earth moved. The angels wept. The Polaroids are, uh, uh... are in my other coat. Nothing happened. Nothing happened. I woke up in my underwear. I'll bet you looked nice. Did you get me that way? I, uh... I took off your shoes. I took off your dress. I put you on the bed. I kept my eyes closed the whole time. And that was it? I might have peeked. I don't remember. I don't have all day to hang out here and discuss your sex life. Here. What's this? Open it. Ahem. What's this for? You could use a better briefcase if we're going to put this deal together. You liked it. It has possibilities. I want to go first to Metro Radio Systems. They're a solid, family-owned, midsized network in the South. Had offers before and rejected them. Father's retiring, the son's been forced out. A lot of squabbling, good time to go in. [Intercom Buzzes] O.K. There's one thing we don't get... Why did you come to us? [Buzz Buzz Buzz] Will you excuse me for one second? Sure. You cannot help me! No! Bess, I need Katharine's office right away. I'll be with you in five minutes. I need it five minutes ago. I'll be right with you. What's going on? She's dusting? Jack, my 1:00 is getting a little antsy, so can I walk you to the elevator? Yeah, sure, but first answer my question. Right. Uh... I came to you because... I wanted an ace on this. The best. Mm-hmm. Good thinking. I'll fly down to Memphis in the morning and feel them out. Absolutely. Fine. Everyone wants a part of the McGill mind. You'll just have to wait. Ginny, go right in. I'll be right with you. She's backed up. What are you talking about? Can I get you anything? Coffee, tea? You free for dinner tonight? No. Sorry. O.K. How about tomorrow? I'll be back around 8:00. I can't. When, then? I don't think that we should get involved that way. What about last night? Look, I'm not that girl. - Last night was... special. - It wasn't so special... I had to carry you up three flights of stairs. I meant "unusual" special. Look, we're in a business deal together now. I just don't think we should get involved that way. My life is real complicated. I don't want to complicate it. I just thought dinner, a movie. We both know what we're talking about. I certainly hope so. You know... maybe I just don't like you. Me? Nah. Ha ha ha! Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen Tonight we'll put all other things aside Give in this time and show me some affection We're going for those pleasures in the night You sure she's going to show? It's my engagement party. She knows she's dead meat if she doesn't. ...Please you, I just can't get enough Hi, Tess. ...Move real slow, I'll let it go Let's get excited I'm sorry. I got stuck at work. You'll be out of work, you keep scamming like you are. I am nervous as hell. Mick's about to drown himself in the scotch. He's bad, huh? Throw him a bone, will you? I want happy humans here tonight. I want you, I want you Ooh, boy, I want to love you Tess. Snake. I want to squeeze you, please you... You look different. Well, I'm not the same pathetic, trusting fool I was. It shows, huh? What are you having? Stow this behind the bar for me. I'll have a Chivas, and buy Mick one of whatever. You got it. Ahem. I just meant the hair and the duds and the briefcase. What's going on? Make fun if you want. No, No. You look good. Classy. What, did you have to go to traffic court or something? No, I just got off work. I sort of got a promotion. Well... to Cyn and Tim... to you and me... to you and your promotion... to me getting a boat loan. You what? You did? My loan was approved just this morning. Put a down payment on Jimmy Noonan's old boat. That's so great. Never seen you looking so lovely As you did tonight I've never seen you shine so bright Hmm hmm hmm mmm Never seen so many men Ask you if you wanted to dance Looking for a little romance Given half a chance I have never seen that dress you're wearing Or the highlights in your hair That catch your eye I have been blind Lady in red Woo! "Hours of fun for the entire family. Love, Tess and Mick." Thank you. I put from both of us. I didn't know if you'd gotten something. O.K., toast. We need a toast! Thank you, thank you. From me and Tess, and everybody here, may your life together be long and happy, and may the road always rise up to meet you. Hear, hear! When will we toast the two of you? Yeah! Ha ha ha! Well, we haven't really discussed it. I mean, not recently. You don't discuss it, you just ask. That's right. Here? Yeah! Now? Yeah! On your knees, man. Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick! Mick! Yeah! Ya-hah! Yeah! Woo! Here! Tess, will you marry me? Maybe. Ooh! That's an answer? You want another answer, ask another girl. [Man] Whoa! Sssss! Ha ha! You fuckin' humiliated us in there. You set us up. What did you expect me to do, lie in front of those people... - and automatically say yes? - Didn't know you'd have to lie. I thought you would want me to ask. Three nights ago, I find you in bed with Doreen. We have a drink and a dance, then you want an answer - about the rest of my life. - All right. O.K. Here we are. Will you marry me or what? Jesus, Mick. Do we have to decide now? I want to get things solidified in my life. You're not the only one who's got plans. I said maybe. Maybe means dick! Fuck maybe! I want an answer! Please don't yell. You treat me like... Why do we always end up talking about the way you get treated? Who the fuck died and made you Grace Kelly? I am not steak. You can't just order me. I don't need this. You get your priorities straight, maybe we'll talk. Right now, we're history. [Ring] Katharine Parker's office. Um... I'll switch you over. [Knock On Door] Tess, it's me. I couldn't find the right shoes. Shh! Tess McGill's office. Who's calling? One moment, please. Ahem... Jack. Went well in Memphis. Yeah. Really well, I think. We'll have to move fast and hit them high. Armbrister thinks of Metro as family. You know how that can be. He's willing to listen. We got to get Trask to talk sweet. He's thinking about 70 mill. I've been up here all night, working the numbers. I'd like to go over it with you. Can we meet for lunch? Lunch is all right, isn't it? Daylight, lot of people around. There's a real romantic souvlaki stand in front of your place. You're in no particular danger, I think. Yeah. Meet you there around 1:00. O.K., I'll see you then. Bye. Mick's really raw. He says he's going to throw the rest of your stuff out. He kept talking at me till 5:00 this morning. Oh, God, Cyn, I'm sorry. How hard would it be to crash a wedding? What are you talking about? Oren Trask's daughter is getting married tomorrow. There's a reception following, so I figured I blend in, I get to Trask. I mean, how hard could that be? The wedding party's not going to admit they've never seen you before. Nobody knows everybody at those things, right? - Tess, wait a minute... - All I need is five minutes. Tess, I'm talking to you. What? First of all, look me in the eye and tell me you're not thinking, even in your wildest dreams, Mr. Briefcase- Let's-Have-Lunch will take you away from all of this. We're doing a deal together, that's all. You'll get your heart stomped just like you're stomping Mick's. It wasn't me popping Doreen Dimucci in our bed. How come you're all on his side? I'm not. You're not even giving him the chance to make it up to you, and that's not like you. If you're so smart, why don't you act smart and save your ass while you still can? You're not going to have any job. You're out of your man and home already. I'm going to come clean as soon as I get my end set up. I swear. I know what I'm doing. So do I. You're screwin' up your life. No, I'm trying to make it better. I won't spend the rest of my life working my ass off and getting nowhere because I followed rules I didn't set up. [Telephone Rings] Tess McGill's office. Katharine! Of course it's still your office. I don't know... I'll see you, Tess. Cyn. Sometimes I dance around the house in my underwear. It doesn't make me Madonna... never will. [Katharine] Umm... are you there? Yes, Katharine. Don't get too used to those long lunches. They're letting me go a week from today. Isn't that a little faster than you thought? The doctor says I've got great bones. Of course, his aren't too bad, either. Ha ha ha! Anyway, I need you to summarize... Hi, Shatz! Send that along with the last two quarterly reports. You are a sport. Yes, I am a sport. Thanks. I'll talk to you soon. O.K. Bye. What kind of figures have you thrown at them? No exact figures yet. Well, what's their ballpark? I wanted to get them excited about the concept before I started throwing actual figures at them. Are they excited? They're going to be. Wait a minute. I've been working on this for 36 hours trying to put it together. I got a progress meeting with the head of my department at 2:00. Where the hell are we? Don't yell at me. Hey, answer me. Well, as a matter of fact, I'm going to see Trask himself tomorrow. I feel we're strong enough to go right to him. Where are we meeting him? What time? He's not expecting both of us. Are you trying to fly this thing without me? No... I wouldn't do that. You set up this meeting without me. What does that say? What the hell kind of way to do business is this? Would you calm down? How am I supposed to calm down? One lost deal is all it takes to get canned. My phone will have an inch of tape... the names of new guys over the names of old guys... good men who aren't there anymore because of one lost deal. I don't want to get buried under tape. No one's trying to bury you under tape. So I've been in a little slump. I'm not afraid to admit it. There it is. But give me a break. Don't go leaving me out. If you've got doubts about me, say them to my face. Give me that much. I don't have any doubts about you. O.K. You need me, you know. I mean any doubts about your abilities. You need me at that meeting. Is he jet lagged, or he just lunches late? 3:00 is a late lunch. It's not exactly lunch, but there will be food. What's the story, Tess? It's his daughter's wedding. That's the meeting? It's the perfect opportunity. He's happy, he's had a little champagne, we look for an opening... trust me. Are we supposed to jump out of the cake? Don't be silly. [Music Playing] Welcome to our party. Come in. Hello. Nice to see you. Do you know which table you're at? - No. - Yes. I do, darling. Oh, I see Phyllis. Come on. Glad you could make it. Oren and Barbara Trask. Tess McGill. What a great idea. - Jack Trainer. - So nice to see you again. The kids thought it would be fun. - You must be friends of Mark's. - Right. Let's get you over there. Actually, I really should go powder my bathroom... nose. - Darling, will you wait here? - Sure. It's so nice to see you... later. I think I'll get a drink. Bunny. Who's he? Wow! He is gorgeous. He's so cute. Mm-hmm. Get a grip. Tess, get a grip. Ahem... We're not even invited to this thing, are we? So we're not exactly invited, but he's here and we're here, so that makes us... Total idiots. In the right place at the right time. You're like one of those crazed cops... the kind nobody wants to ride with because his partners end up dead or crazy. Just act like you belong. [Crying] Oh... Do you love it, or do you hate it? Love it. So do I, but Mark says it looks like Nicaragua and we're making some statement. Oh, no. It's just like paradise. It's like paradise with little gold palm trees. Ha ha ha. Thank you. You're welcome. I hope I'm not being rude, but... who are you? I'm Tess. I'm a friend of Mark's. I'm so happy I could be here for you today. Glorious. Fabulous. Stunning. Really. Super. Elegant. [Pop] Perfect. You're right. This is crazy, so let's just go. Excuse me. The woman dancing with Oren, what's her name? Oh, Elizabeth Stowenfield. That's right. Uh... Liz? Beth? Bitsy. Bitsy. That's right. Jack. You want to do it, do it. Excuse us. Bitsy, don't break my heart and tell me you don't remember me. Of course I do. Excuse us. Ha ha ha! Talk about a small world, huh? I mean, here we've just met, and yet I feel I've spent so much time working with you. I'm in Mergers and Acquisitions at Petty-Marsh. I wish we were having more luck with your team. So do I. So do I. I've tried to set you up with a radio network, but my bosses think you're stuck on acquiring television. That's not true. I said, the man who in 1971 looked into the future and saw that it was named microwave technology, the man who applied Japanese management principles while others were still kowtowing to the unions, the man who saw the Ma Bell breakup coming... this man did not get to be this man... you, I mean... by shutting himself off to new ideas. Am I right? - I think you're right. - Damn straight, I'm right. If you've got the right property, I'd love to hear about it. You would? Absolutely. There she is. I'm hogging the father of the bride, and I see Phyllis coming in. What do you say that I call you on Monday? Our consultant is Tim Draper. Tim. Right. Honey, I'm starved. So am I. Bye. Bye. Ha ha ha! Go ahead and laugh. He wants us to meet his people Monday. Oren Trask... the man who said, what if we slice the bread before we sold it? - All right. - No, no, no. I loved it. I had fun, and you were amazing. You think so? Amazing. Ha ha ha. The Fort Worth station projected revenues should read up 8% not 6, and where it says the FCC ruling on Metro's Memphis transmitter is pending, that's outdated. FCC approved it Friday. Doubles the signal reach. Ups the station's value by 30%. And now, back to our regularly scheduled programming. I guess we're ready. Trainer and McGill. - Yes. Top of the stairs. - Thank you. Are we waiting for Mr. Trask? Mr. Trask doesn't sit in at this level. Of course he doesn't. Ahem... Here's the way we see it... Trask Industries has two important needs at this time. By acquiring Metro Radio Network, you nail two birds with one stone. Do you have any proposals besides Metro? No. Why? Metro's a terrific opportunity. I'm sure it is, but a Chicago group just put a bear hug on Metro this morning... the company's in play. Just this morning? Who? The Slade Brothers. Trask isn't aiming at radio anyway. We don't want to get into a bidding war. A moment, please. Armbrister looks at Metro as part of his family. He cares who he's selling to. Yes... and he holds the majority of the stock. If the Slades are uninvited... and I'm sure they are... and Armbrister and Trask can agree on a deal, then we won't have a war. If I get Armbrister, will Trask meet him? Lot of "ifs." We really don't want to get involved. 24 hours. Sorry. Not interested. [Ring] Yes, sir? All right, sir. Yes, he'll take the meeting. That was Mr. Trask? Yes, it was. How did he know? He knows everything. Hmm... Thanks a lot. Thanks. [Whistling] How did you get this scar? Some guy pulled a knife in Detroit. Really? No. No. I was 19. I thought it would be cool to have a pierced ear. My girlfriend stuck the needle through. I fainted and hit my chin on the toilet. Ha ha ha ha! And you've been telling that story ever since? You're the only one who knows the true story. Except the girlfriend. I had her, uh... disappear. It's too bad. Nice girl. Real shame. Jack, there's something that I have to tell you. [Telephone Ringing] Hello. Hi. Umm... Oh, no. No. It can't wait? Umm... Yeah, O.K. Well, call me when you get in. O.K. Uhh... me, too. O.K. Bye. Bye. [Sigh] O.K... There's this woman. It's over... but technically, it's not. I just haven't got a chance to break it off yet. It's O.K. You don't have to explain. We were supposed to go away a couple weeks ago, and I was going to tell her then, but I had to work, and I never got there. It's just a... timing thing. It's just she broke her leg skiing, and I couldn't see doing it over the phone. You know, kicking somebody when they're down. I wouldn't have mentioned it, except she's in your department at Petty. You mentioned her the first time you called. Katharine. Parker, yeah. Now, what did you want to tell me, huh? Oh, it's not important. 120 even. Oh, Miss, you forgot your book. Ha ha ha ha! Tess, it's me. I'm back. Thanks. Oh, God. She took a muscle relaxant for the flight down. - Let's all have one, shall we? - I don't think so. Oh, I need a telephone. Oh, Tess, take care of the bags. I'll meet you at the car. O Tannenbaum O Tannenbaum Oh, I love these pills. Just for a minute, Jack... please. I must see you, darling. My apartment in one hour, and I won't take no for an answer. No, I won't take no for an answer. Oh, I'm home! I'm home! I'm home! Oh... Oh, God. Did you happen to see this? What is it? It's your idea for a Trask radio acquisition. I was planning to send it to Jack Trainer... give your idea one last go-round. But it occurs to me, looking at it, that it reads as though it were my idea. Jack got burned once... he was accused of stealing a plan for taking a company private. He's very sticky about the ethics of reviewing other people's formative strategies. He wouldn't have looked at it if I'd said it was from a colleague, and I couldn't very well say it was a secretary's notion. Anyway, the point is that I'm trying to get you heard. Oh. What am I saying? If you had seen it, you simply would have asked me about it. Trust. I'll need help bathing and changing. Oh, I need something to cover this cast. There's an afghan on the chair. Perfect. If that will be all... Oh, and some perfume. Uhh... shalimar. on the dresser. He loves shalimar. He who? Jack Trainer who. He's on his way over. I have to go... doctor's appointment. Oh, one last thing... Run to the drugstore and get my pills. I really have to go. The doctor will understand. Thanks. Keep the change. Who is it? It's Jack. [Buzz] Katharine? In the bedroom. Jack. Katharine. Boy, did I ever miss you. Ha ha ha. Does it hurt? Look at you. You said it was urgent. I'd forgotten how damn handsome you are. Thanks. Look, uh... I meant what I said. I'm really swamped... Some welcome home. I haven't even gotten a kiss. Ha ha ha! Ahh... hmm... There's some champagne in the little fridge. You want to get it for us? Sure, and then I really do have to go. [Pop] Where are the glasses? Try the dishwasher. There you are. You know I love you. You know that. Katharine, I really do have to get going. These past few weeks, I've heard this funny sound down deep inside. Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock. My biological clock. Big deal going. Principals are meeting... And I've been thinking... let's merge... you and I. Think of it, darling. Mr. and Mrs. Fabulously Happy. Katharine, it's really not a good time to talk. You're right. Can Big Jack come out to play? Little Jack really has to get going. Little Kate has been so lonely. No, no, no! Jack! What is it? There's something I have to tell you. - There's someone else. - Someone else? Someone else that I have to be meeting with right now... big deal going. Can't be in two places at the same time. Talk to you later. Bye. Ha ha ha. [Door Closes] Here we are. I've got to run. Sorry. Bye. Tess, you forgot your... [Door Closes] notebook. That... little... slut! Damn you, bitch secretary! Hi. I have a meeting with Mr. Trask. Your name, please. Tess McGill. - It's at the top of the stairs. - Thank you. - Miss... McGill. - Yes. Good afternoon. Let me take your coat. Thank you. This way, please. Thank you. Hi. Hi. Is everything O.K? Yeah. Yeah. You're the only one from Petty here. What's going on? I'm flying solo on this. Good. Armbrister and Trask are in the corner. We're waiting to see what color smoke comes out. Tell me something... If a colleague of mine had a strategy, would you look at it if I asked? Yeah, sure. No ethics problem? You know, open to accusations about stealing? I look at stuff all the time. Nobody's ever accused me of stealing. What's it about? Um... I don't know. I'm so nervous I can't... stand still. You'll be fine. I love you. I love you, too. Gentlemen. There was a story on the news last night showing life imitating an old children's riddle. It seems that a truck got stuck at the entrance to the Holland Tunnel. Too high for the clearance. For hours, the experts tried to find some way to unwedge the vehicle, but to no avail. Finally, a 10-year-old girl in a passing car suggested letting the air out of the truck's tires, thus lowering it to the clearance level, which they did, and it worked. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! By letting some of the air out of our strategy to expand into broadcasting, Miss McGill and Mr. Trainer have effectively shown all of us here at Trask the light at the end of our tunnel. [Applause] Uh, gentlemen, and ladies, I've decided to sell Mr. Trask the Metro Radio System for $68.5 million in cash and securities. Now, of course, this is an agreement in principle. As to... ha ha ha... what constitutes principles in this day and age, I'll leave up to you barracudas to squabble over. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! [Katharine] I'm certain they want to hear this! This is a closed meeting, and you can't... Thank God I'm here. What's going on? You're being tricked! Katharine, what... Jack, just trust me and sit down. My name is Katharine Parker, and I'm an associate partner in Mergers and Acquisitions at Petty-Marsh, and this woman is my secretary. She's not! Oh, no? Ask her. You're not her secretary. I can explain, Jack. Jesus. You are her secretary. While I was laid up with broken bones, she riffled through my desk, found my memo outlining a Trask radio acquisition, and has been passing it off as her idea. It was my idea. She stole it from me, I swear. Good God, Tess, don't you know when to stop? But you're lying! Oh. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Ahh. Thank you all so much. The up side is that I have found out in time to control the damage. We have containment, and we have a deal on the table. I say... pass me a set of papers. Let's get on with it. Who's running this thing? Just... a second, please. I know you don't believe me, but... Oh, it doesn't matter. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Ahem. Ahem. Well... gentlemen, the players may have changed but the game remains the same, and the name of the game is let's make a deal. If you'll all turn to page 22 in your prospectus, I'd like to take you through the terms of transferal. [Bells Ringing] Oh, hi! Oh, that's so nice! Bye. Bye. Aah! 0hh! [Horn Honks] Well, they did it. Yeah, they sure did. You really look... great. How are you? Good. Good. Business is great, and, uh... Mick, did you see me? I caught it one-handed. Oh, hi. Hey, Doreen. My boat's booked through three weeks from now. Doreen's working the lines. That's great. Really. So how's life in the fast lane? Well, it's, um... fast. It's real fast and busy and... It's good to see you, Mick. I guess I better get. It's good to see you, too. Cyn told us about what happened. It really bites the big one, Tess. We took up a little collection. - Thanks. - It's not much. It's just enough to go get toasted some night when you really need it. Don't say no. We really wanted to. No paying Con Ed with it. O.K., thanks. So what are you going to do now, huh? Oh, you know... play some golf, redecorate the country house. Ha ha ha! I don't know. Start all over. Find a job, a place to live, and just wise up and not take the whole thing so seriously. I'll be O.K. Ahem. Bye. Bye, sweetie. - Thank you. - We'll miss you. Thanks. So long, Tess. Bye, Tess. Don't work too hard! Good-bye, Tess. Ooh! I'm sorry. shit. I've been trying to find you. Just leave me alone. Just one thing... Was you and me just part of the scheme, too? No! Look, if I had told you I was just some secretary, you never would have taken the meeting. Think about it. Maybe you would have fed me a few drinks, then tried to get me into the sack, end of story. That's not true. Are you sure about that? Can you honestly tell me that it wouldn't have made a difference? Who's fooling who here? What's this, more stolen files? No. It's my stuff from the desk. Your stuff? Now, there's a broad term. No. It's my stuff. Maybe you can fool these guys with this saint act, but do not ever speak to me like we don't know what happened. Tess, this is business. Let's just bury the hatchet, O.K? Know where you can bury it? Get your bony ass out of my sight. If you think I said I loved you as part of some scheme, that's really pathetic! My God. She'll stop at nothing. What kind of show are you people running? I'm sorry you had to see this, but it means nothing to us. Jack, let's get upstairs. - Not without her. - Jack. Trainer, are you trying to blow this deal? No, sir. I'm trying to make sure that it gets done right. Tess is this team's leader. She put this deal together. We shouldn't proceed without her. You shouldn't let your johnson make business decisions for you. I'm not, sir. I'm telling you, she's your man. What brings you to that conclusion? She said so, and I believe her. I'm afraid that's not good enough. Are you with us or not? No. Jack, I forgive you. Now get on this elevator. Sorry, Katharine. You will be sorry, Jack. Ask her to tell you about the hole in your deal. What hole? She's playing games. Fine. Go. - No. What hole? - Look. The people page? Now this is ridiculous. "Former Miss America Dawn Bixby has been house hunting here. "Seems Dawn and hot, hot, hot DJ-hubby Slim Slicker are getting ready to take a bite out of the Big Apple." So? Slim Slicker's one of Metro's major assets. Syndicated to all their stations. The cornerstone of their programming. You lose him and Metro's just O.K. real estate with falling ratings, and you're not buying it for a write-off. Better make sure he's locked in before they sign anything. Oren, I have this covered. Upstairs, shall we? Oren! Hear the lady out, sir. There's another elevator. You're on. O.K. See, this is Forbes. It's just your basic article about how you were looking to expand into broadcasting. The same day... I'll never forget this... I'm reading page 6 of the Post. There's this item on Bobby Stein, the radio talk show guy who does all those gross jokes about Ethiopia and the Betty Ford Center. He's hosting this charity auction... real blue bloods. Now I turn the page to Susie, who does the society stuff, and there's this picture of your daughter. She's helping to organize the charity ball, so I started to think, "Trask. Radio. Trask, radio." Then I hooked up with Jack, and he came on board with Metro, and, and... so now, here we are. Oren, we don't have any more time for fairy tales. Miss Parker, let me ask you a question. How did you come up with the idea for Trask to buy out Metro? How did I, uh... Well, let's see. The, um... [Oren] The impulse. What led you to put the two together? I would have to check my files. I can't recall exactly the, um... It's not as if it was in the mainstream. You know, it would have to be the, um... Jack, help me out here. Oren, I beg your pardon, but if... if you are insinuating... If I were you, I'd go to your office and take a long, last look around. Because in five minutes, I'm going to see to it that you get the boot, but good. Oren, this is a simple misunderstanding. You cannot... I can, and I will! Now get your... What did you call it? - Bony ass. - Bony ass. Right. Bony ass out of my sight. I'm sorry, but I simply won't stand for that kind of talk. Will you excuse me, please? [Door Closes] Why didn't you tell us this in the board room? No one was going to listen, sir, not to me. You can bend the rules once you get upstairs, but not while you're trying to get there. And if you're like me, you can't get there without bending the rules. You've got fire in your belly. Or was this a one-time stunt that you pulled? I'm not sure what you mean. I have something in my belly, but I think it's nervous knots. Are you willing to go out on that limb every day, working for me, legitimately? Yes, sir. Have to be right at the entry level. Have any problem with that? No, sir. Gumption, Miss McGill. Yes, sir. See you tomorrow. O.K. Trainer. Dwayne. Let's go back to my office and see about this Slim what's his name's contract. Be right with you, sir. - Aww. - Aww. Way to go, Tess. Way to go. Beauty! For you. You like it? Ha ha ha! Peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Milk money. Twinkies. Pen, pencil, ruler. Apple for the teacher. Now, remember... Play nice with the other kids. Make sure you're home before dark. Hi. Tess McGill. Good morning. Good morning. The director's out sick today. She'll see you first thing tomorrow. Miss Baxter's already up there. She'll show you the layout. It's at the end of the hall. Thank you. You're welcome. Anybody will be an improvement over that terrorist. I mean... something semihuman. Oh. I didn't hear you come in. I'm Alice Baxter. Tess McGill. I was just... using the phone. Yes, well... that happens. How about some coffee? Sure, just tell me where. No. I'll get it. Oh. How? Milk and sugar, please. Thank you. Uh... Miss McGill? Yes? That's your desk... in there. I don't think so. Oh, yes. I sit out here. I'm sorry. I thought the secretary would sit out here. That's right. I'm the secretary. If it's O.K., I prefer "assistant." You've got a 10:00 meeting with Slater, 11:00 with Donahue from Logistics... his office on 23... and lunch with Mr. Trask, his office downtown, 1:00. It's all right there in the computer. Just hit shift "S" for your schedule. Um... When I saw you in here on the phone with your feet up, I figured this was your office. I'm sorry about that, Miss McGill. It won't happen again... ever. It's O.K. Maybe now would be a good time to go over what you expect of me. Uh... Ahem. I, uh, I expect you to call me Tess. I don't expect you to fetch me coffee unless you're getting some for yourself, and, um... the rest we'll just make up as we go along. O.K? O.K. I'll be right outside if you need anything. Fine. Cyn. Guess where I am. Ha ha! Let the river run Let all the dreamers wake the nation Come the New Jerusalem Silver cities rise The morning lights The streets that lead them And sirens Call them on With a song It's asking for the taking Trembling, shaking Oh, my heart is aching We're coming to the edge Running on the water Coming through the fog, your sons and daughters We, the great and small Stand on a star And blaze a trail of desire Through the darkening dawn It's asking for the taking Come run with me now The sky is the color of blue You've never even seen in the eyes of your lover Oh, my heart is aching We're coming to the edge Running on the water Coming through the fog, your sons and daughters It's asking for the taking Trembling, shaking Oh, my heart is aching We're coming to the edge Running on the water Coming through the fog, your sons and daughters Let the river run Let the river run Let all the dreamers wake the nation Let all the dreamers wake the nation Come the New Jerusalem
