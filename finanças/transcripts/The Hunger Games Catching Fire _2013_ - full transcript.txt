(TWIG SNAPS) Oh, whoa. Easy. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Saw some turkeys on the way here. Crossed right in front of me like I wasn't even there. - How rude of them. - That's what happens. You spend six days a week working in the mines and stupid birds start to think they own these woods. When's the tour leave? Couple hours. Well, let's go. (TURKEYS GOBBLING) (GASPS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Hey, whoa. You're okay. -(SCREAMING) (TURKEYS GOBBLING) You're okay. You're safe. You're safe. It's okay. You're here with me. You're with me. (PANTING) Okay, okay. I'm sorry. Oh, we... We should... We should go. KATNISS: Are you coming to the train station? I think you have enough people saying goodbye without me there. Only a few I actually care about. It might be easier if I didn't. It's only a few weeks. I'll be back before the snow melts. Yeah, a lot can happen in a few weeks. Are we gonna do this again? Gale, it was an act. Yeah, it was a good one. I did what I had to do to survive. If I didn't, I'd be dead. I had to do that. At least once. (HISSES) Haymitch! (BOTTLES CLINKING) Haymitch! Haymitch, wake up. It's Tour Day. Haymitch. (YELLING) What are you doing? Cameras are gonna be here in an hour. If you wanted to be babied, you should've asked Peeta. PEETA: Asked me what? HAYMITCH: Asked you to wake me without giving me pneumonia. You are a strangely dislikeable person. But you do have your virtues. Would you like some bread, Katniss? No, I ate at the Hob, but thank you. You're welcome. Brr. You two have a lot of warming up to do before show time. Which is in an hour, so take a bath, Haymitch. I just did. Did you have a good walk, dear? - Walk? I was just out - We have visitors. Miss Everdeen. This way, please. (DOOR CLOSES) Such bravery. Such spirit. Such... Contempt. President Snow. What an honor. My dear, I think we can make this so much simpler if we agree not to lie to each other. What do you think? Yes, I think that would save time. Sit down, please. I have a problem, Miss Everdeen. A problem that began the moment you revealed those poison berries in the arena. If that Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane, had had any brains at all, he would have blown you to bits then and there. But here you are. I expect you can guess where he is. Yes, I think so. After that fiasco, there was nothing left to do but to let you play out your little scenario. And you were very good. That whole love-crazed, besotted schoolgirl routine. Impressive. Truly. You convinced the people in The Capitol. Unfortunately, not everyone in the districts fell for it. I mean, you can't know this, but in several of them, people viewed your little trick with the berries as an act of defiance. Not as an act of love. And if a girl from District 12 of all places can defy The Capitol and walk away unharmed, what is to prevent them from doing the same? What is to prevent, say, an uprising? That can lead to revolution. And then, in a fraction of time, the whole system collapses. It must be a fragile system, if it can be brought down by just a few berries. Yes, it is, indeed. But not in the way you imagine it. How should I imagine? You should imagine thousands upon thousands of your people dead. This town of yours reduced to ashes. Imagine it gone. Made radioactive. Buried under dirt as if it had never existed, like District 13. You fought very hard in The Games, Miss Everdeen. But they were games. Would you like to be in a real war? No. Good. Neither would I. Did your mother make these? Peeta. Oh. He's a lovely boy. Tell me. At what point did he realize the depth of your indifference towards him? - I'm not indifferent. - Don't lie! You promised. Why don't you just kill me now? I don't want to kill you. I want us to be friends. But if not friends, then allies. What do I need to do? When you and Peeta are on tour, you need to smile. You need to be grateful. But, above all, you need to be madly, prepared-to-end-it-all in love. You think you can manage that? Yes. Yes, what? I'll convince them. No. Convince me. For you, Miss Everdeen. (MONITOR SWITCHES ON) Do convince me. For the sake of your loved ones. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) EFFIE: Stop. Take it all in. This is sacred ground. History was made here. Oh. You'll get used to the smell. - Hmm. -(SIGHS) Hello! (GASPS) Om There she is. My greatest triumph! FLAVIUS: Our little superstar. (ALL COOING) Sweetie, we've missed you. EFFIE: What a cute little house. So quaint, isn't it? Of course, you've heard about Cinna? What happened to Cinna? Oh, dear, he's a fashion star. You're his muse. Everyone in The Capitol's wearing him. Everyone. - Everyone. - Well, not everyone. Oh! KATNISS: Cinna! PRIM: Katniss? OCTAVIA: Katniss, is this your sister? Oh, sweetie! Are you okay? OCTAVIA: Oh, just adorable! - Yeah. - Ready to work? - Yeah. - All right. Good. (SHOW THEME PLAYING) Welcome! (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Last year, the 74th Hunger Games brought us the greatest love story of our time. Two brave young people, against all odds chose to die rather than to lose each other. As a nation, we shared their agony. But we had so little time to revel in their joy. (GASPS) It's time! She's done, she's lovely. We must feed the monster. All right now. CAESAR: Let's go to District 12 and find our star-crossed lovers! You're excited. You're in love. Big smiles for the camera in three, two, one. CAESAR: There she is! Katniss Everdeen! The Girl on Fire. (CAESAR CHUCKLES) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) And there he is! Peeta Mellark! The Baker's Boy. (CAESAR CHUCKLES) (AUDIENCE CHEERING) - Ooh. -(GRUNTS) CAESAR: Uh-oh. Whoa, oh. Trouble in paradise (CHUCKLES) I hope they're all right. Um... (CLEARS THROAT) Ahem. Anyone at home? (CHUCKLES) Should we come back later? Sorry, Caesar. (CHUCKLES) Oh, please. It's all right. It's your day. It's your day. So how's it going? We're good. That's it? That's all we get? "We're good‚Äù? So taciturn all of a sudden. Peeta, give me some details! (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Yeah, things are, uh... Things are great here in 12. Thanks to the generosity of The Capitol, we've never been closer. -25 yards, to be exact. -(CHUCKLES) (CAESAR LAUGHS) Fantastic! We'll be checking in with both of you throughout the Victory Tour. Thank you so much, Katniss E verdeen and Peeta Mellark! (AUDIENCE CHEERING) -(CAMERAS POWER DOWN) - EFFIE: Wonderful! Everybody in motion. We are out of here in 10. That was nice acting. You, too. Almost thought that kiss was real. EFFIE: Come along, children, we are on a schedule. The train awaits! Fabulous food, fabulous wine, the massages, spa treatments. I told them nothing but the best for my two Victors. It all needs to be, uh... Fabulous? Exactly. Now, the schedule is a bit of a bear. 12 days, 12 districts. But it's mostly parties, celebrations, adoring fans to greet you at every stop along the way, and then we wrap it up in The Capitol. All you need to do is give a few speeches, wave to the crowds, and enjoy your time in the spotlight. You've earned it. What did you say? Katniss. I said, "Enjoy it, Katniss, you've earned it." By killing people- Young lady... -(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) -(COMPUTER BEEPS) (DOOR LOCKS) (DOOR OPENS) I'm really not in the mood for a lecture. I'll apologize to Effie later. I thought you were Haymitch. You don't have to apologize to anybody. Including me. I know it's not fair of me to hold you to things you said in The Games. You saved us. I know that. But I can't go on acting for the cameras, and then just ignoring each other in real life. So if you can stop looking at me like I'm wounded, then I can quit acting like it. And then maybe we have a shot at being friends. I've never been very good at friends. For starters, it does help when you know the person. I hardly know anything about you except that you're stubborn and good with a bow. That about sums me up. No, there's more than that, you just don't want to tell me. It's like I said, I'm... See, Katniss, the way the whole friend thing works is you have to tell each other the deep stuff. - The deep stuff? - Yeah. Uh-oh. Like what? Like, uh... What's your favorite color? Well, now you've stepped over the line. (CHUCKLES) Seriously, though, what is it? Green. What's yours? Orange. Like Effie's hair? No. (CHUCKLES) Not that orange. More, uh... More like a sunset kind of orange. (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) Did you see that? What? Whoa. (SCOFFS) Well, I never. This is not very festive. The mayor will make some introductory remarks. And then you just have to say a few words. It's customary, of course, to give a brief eulogy to the district's fallen Tributes. For 11, that's Thresh and Rue. Here are the speeches. I can do the talking if you want. Thank you. MAYOR: Ladies and gentlemen, the Victors of the 74th Hunger Games. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark! EFFIE: Smile, smile, smile, smile. Stand up straight. You're on camera. (MILD APPLAUSE) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING ON RADIO) Thank you. We're honored to be here with you today. And to be with the families of your fallen Tributes. EFFIE: (GASPS) He put down the cards. - PEETA: Though they fought... -(SHUSHES) -...and lived with honor... - Why do I bother? ...and dignity until the end, both Thresh and Rue were so young. But our lives aren'tjust measured in years. They're measured in the lives of people we touch around us. For myself, for Katniss, we know that without Rue and without Thresh, we wouldn't be standing here today. So in recognition of that, knowing that it in no way can make up for your loss, we'd like to donate one month of our winnings to the families of the Tributes, every year, for the rest of our lives. -(APPLAUSE) - Oh, shit. (STUTTERS) Can he do that? He can't. But he did. (SIGHS) Why doesn't he just stick to the cards? PEETAI Thank you. I just wanted to say that I didn't know Thresh. I only spoke to him once. He could have killed me, but instead he showed me mercy. That's a debt I'll never be able to repay. I did know Rue. She wasn't just my ally, she was my friend. I see her in the flowers that grow in the meadow by my house. I hear her in a Mockingjay song. I see her in my sister Prim. She was too young, too gentle. (SNIFFLING) And I couldn't save her. I'm sorry. (MAN WHISTLES TUNE) (CROWD GASPS) (CLAMORING) KATNISSI No! No! Wait! Wait! No! Leave him alone! Leave him alone! No! Let me go! Please leave him alone! No! No! No! (GUN FIRES) You! No, no, no! - Come here! Stop it! -(SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) Stop it! Stop! - What did I do? -(SHUSHES) Come on. Shut up. EFFIE: In all my years, I've never seen... (CLAMORING OUTSIDE CONTINUES) You two have a very simple task. I never meant for anyone to get killed. He has to know that. What are you talking about? Who has to know what? Snow. He came to see me. He's worried about rebellion in the districts. He thinks that they don't believe our love story. HAYMITCH: So he wants you to make them believe it? - To calm things down. - PEETA: You know, Katniss, you shoulda told me that before I went out there, and tried to give these people the money. I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do. He threatened to kill my family. Well, I have family, too. Okay? People that I need to protect. What about them? Who protects them? Katniss, what were you thinking? I was thinking about Rue. Haymitch, please... Please, just help me get through this trip. Please, just help us get through this. This trip? Girl, wake up. (SNAPS FINGERS) This trip doesn't end when you get back home. You never get off this train. You two are mentors now. That means that every year, they're gonna drag you out, and broadcast the details of your romance. Every year, your private life becomes theirs. From now on, your job is to be a distraction. So people forget what the real problems are. - So what do we do? - HAYMITCH: You're gonna smile. You're gonna read the cards that Effie gives you. And you're gonna live happily ever after. Think you can do that? Huh? Yeah? Come here. You're gonna be okay. I promise. PEETA: Katniss and I want to share with you our victory. And our gratitude to The Capitol for bringing us together. It was the bond of love, forged in the crucible of The Games that was our greatest prize. For it is love and true love that allows us all to bear our hardships. That mends the heart and banishes loneliness and gives meaning to our lives. KATNISS: We also want to share with you the sorrows of your losses. The Tributes of this... The Tributes of this district were brave and noble warriors. They brought honor to their families and pride to their people. We are all of us united, both victors and vanquished, in serving a common purpose. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Thank you. One day, I'm gonna volunteer. Just like you did. (SCREAMING) (GASPING) It was just a dream. I'm sorry. It's okay. I get 'em, too. Goodnight. Peeta. Will you stay with me? Yeah. Always. KATNISS: We are all of us united, both victors and vanquished, in serving a common purpose. The power and glory -of The Capitol. - MAN: Put down the cards! Tell us what you really think! Panem today. Panem tomorrow. Panem forever. (CROWD CLAMORING) Your hair looks lovely, darling. When did you start wearing it like that? Everyone at school wears it like this now, Grandpa. Snow is watching us. If he wants you to pacify the districts, I promise you, he's not happy. Instead of being in love, you two sound like you're reciting from a drilling manual. You try reading that stuff that Effie writes us. Tell that to President Snow when you see him two days from now. I'm open to suggestions. We could get married. That's not helping. I'm serious. If, like you said, we're on this train forever, it's gonna happen eventually. Why not now? (CHUCKLES) It does make a statement. I'll give you that. Yeah, sure. Let's do it. CAESAR: Just when you thought things couldn't get more exciting going into a very special Quarter Quell, our two lethal lovers... My favorite expression. -(LAUGHING) -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) ...from District 12 have surprised us with a new twist in their love affair. Let's take a look. - AUDIENCE: Aw... -(APPLAUSE) A fairy tale ending for two star-crossed lovers. That's beautiful. Beautiful. And then tonight, the tour that began in the hollows of District 12 will end where? The Presidential Palace. The party of the year. Eyes bright. Chins up. Smiles on. I'm talking to you, Katniss. Now, there'll be photographers. Interviews. Everyone will be here to celebrate you. My Victors. (SIGHS) Breathe it all in, children. This is all for you. It's cozy. Attitude. (EXHALES) Come, come. (ALL CHEERING) Come along. Excuse us, excuse us. Come, come. Hold hands. And the library. All mahogany. Hello, hello! Not yet, not yet. No, no, no. (GIGGLES) Ooh, curtains! Everybody who's anybody is here. And they all want to meet you. Flavius! Octavia! (REGAL MUSIC PLAYING) Try one of these. They are divine. No, I can't eat another thing. - Here. - PEETA: What's this? FLAVIUS: It's for when you're full. It makes you sick. So you can go on eating. How else could you taste everything? I think it's time for a dance. Katniss? (WALTZ PLAYING) People are starving in 12. Here, they're just throwing it up to stuff more in. Katniss? Peeta. This is Plutarch Heavensbee. Head Gamemaker. Successor to Seneca Crane. That's a tough act to follow. Peeta! (BOTH LAUGH) May I? Please. So how do you like the party? It's a little overwhelming. It's appalling- Still, if you abandon your moral judgment, it can be fun. So are you having fun? I'm the Head Gamemaker. Fun is my job. Thought that was what happened to Seneca Crane. Too much fun. Seneca decided to quit breathing. Decided. It was that or poison berries. Being Head Gamemaker has never been the most secure job in the world. Then why are you here? Same reason as you. I volunteered. VVhy? Ambition. The chance to make The Games mean something. The Games don't mean anything. They only mean to scare us. Well, maybe it was you who inspired me to come back. (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING) -(GUESTS CHEERING) - Ah! The Presidential welcome. I'm sure we'll meet again. Katniss, come. The President awaits. You think we convinced him? I'm not sure what else we can do. (CROWD CHEERING) Tonight, on this, the last day of their tour, I want to welcome our two Victors. Two young people who embody our ideals of strength and valor. And I, personally, want to congratulate them on the announcement of their engagement. (ALL CHEERING) Your love has inspired us. And I know it will go on inspiring us every day for as long as you may live. (CROWD CHEERING) (EXPLOSIONS) (PEOPLE CLAMORING ON MONITOR) SNOW: Look at them. She's not who they think she is. She's not a leader. She just wants to save her own skin. It's as simple as that. I think that's true. But she's become a beacon of hope for the rebellion. And she has to be eliminated. I agree she should die. But in the right way. At the right time. It's moves and countermoves. And it's all we gotta look at. Katniss Everdeen is a symbol. Their Mockingjay. They think she's one of them. We need to show that she's one of us. We don't need to destroy her. Just the image. Then we let the people do the rest. What do you propose? Shut down the black markets. Take away what little they have. Then double the amount of floggings and executions. Put them on TV. Broadcast them live. Sow fear. More fear. It won't work. Fear does not work as long as they have hope. And Katniss Everdeen is giving them hope. She's engaged. Make everything about that. What kinda dress is she gonna wear? Floggings. What's the cake gonna look like? Executions. Who's gonna be there? Fear. Blanket coverage. Shove it in their faces. Show them that she is one of us now. (CHUCKLES) They're gonna hate her so much, they might just kill her for you Brilliant. When did you... We need to talk. (SIGHS) Where are we gonna run away? Into the woods. Like we always talked about. If we leave right now, we can be far away from here by tonight. Yeah, who's "we"? You, me and your fiance? It's not just me and Peeta any more. Snow threatened to have you killed. Anyone else? Well, he didn't exactly give me a copy of the list but a good guess, it includes both of our families. Unless what? You and Peeta get married? Unless nothing now. Gale, we can do it. You said yourself that we could do it the morning of the Reaping. (SIGHS) What do you say now? Do you love me? Gale, you know how I feel about you. But I can't think about anyone that way right now. The only thing that I can think about every day, every waking moment since the Reaping, is how afraid I am. There's no room for anything else. But maybe, if we got away from here, if we went somewhere safe, it could be different. I could be different. You think maybe the President's bluffing? He's not bluffing. Not with what's going on in the districts. What do you mean? What did you see? There were people fighting in the streets, and fires, and Peacekeepers were gunning them down, but the people were... What? The people were what? They were fighting back. It's happening- It's finally happening. I should've just eaten the berries in the arena and died like I was supposed to. Then everything would be back to normal and everyone would be safe. Safe for what? To starve? Work like slaves? Send their kids to the Reaping? You haven't hurt people, Katniss. You've given them an opportunity. They just have to be brave enough to take it. There's already talk in the mines. People wanna fight. We have to go, Gale, before they kill us. They Will kill us. What about the other families? Huh? The ones who stay. What happens to them? People are looking to you, Katniss. I don't want anyone looking to me. I can't help them. (VEHICLES APPROACHING) You do what you want. I'm staying here. CRAY: Commander Thread, welcome to District 12. (GRUNTS) Let's get to work. (GUNSHOT ECHOES) (DRILLING) (MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) MAN 1: Let's go! Keep moving! MAN 2: Stay close! PEACEKEEPER: (OVER SPEAKERS) Find and clear. Burn all contraband. (WOMAN 1 WHIMPERING) (WOMAN 1 SCREAMING) WOMAN 2: Let me go! (CLAMORING) KATNISS: Ripper! My eye! I'm gonna get you out of here. WOMAN 31 No! MAN: Leave her be! Stop! WOMAN 31 No! (GRUNTS) In the square. Here. (GROANS) (PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) - Yeah, hold that on there. -(GROANS) (GALE GRUNTING IN DISTANCE) (GALE GROANING) (WHIP CRACKING) (WHIPPING AND GROANING CONTINUES) (GRUNTS) No! No! No! Stop! (GRUNTS) Katniss! (PANTING) It's okay. Just go. It's okay. (SCOFFS) Move. You want another? Go ahead. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Get out of my way! No, you don't want to shoot her. How about I shoot both of you? Look, Commander, you're new here. Trust me, I'm trying to help you. I'm Haymitch. You recognize her? Katniss Everdeen. Darling of The Capitol. (BREATHING HEAVILY) She interfered with a Peacekeeper. I never said she was smart. (CHUCKLES) Look, you already got a couple of lashes in, right? That's not good enough. She's an agitator. Easy, easy- Look... You're sure Snow wants three dead Victors here? Because that's what we're looking at. It's bad enough that you marked up her face on the eve of the big wedding. Let it go. And we will, too. All right. Okay. But next time, it's the firing squad. Excellent idea. I don't care who she is. Clear the square! You're all under curfew. Anyone out after dark will be shot on sight. Get 'em outta here. It's Gale. Get him here. PEETA: Here we go. - Really easy. Up, up -(GRUNTS) Okay. -(GALE SOBS) - PEETA: Okay. Thanks. New head Peacekeeper. Not entirely peaceful. Missed your eye. Doesn't need stitches. MRS. EVERDEEN: Make a snow coat. Peeta, get the snow. I'll grind the herbs. (GROANING LOUDLY) What is that? That's hurting him. He needs morphling. KATNISS: It's okay. Mom. No. I'll do it. Oh, God. (GROANING) (GALE WHIMPERING) Hold him, please. (GRUNTING) -(KATNISS SHUSHING) - PRIM: That's better. (SIGHS) Hey, Catnip. Hey. Thought you'd be gone by now. I'm not going anywhere. I'm gonna stay right here. Cause all kinds of trouble. Me, too. Hey. You wanna get some rest? I can look after him for a while. I'm gonna go get him more snow. (DOOR CLOSES) Hey. How's your eye? It's not my eye that's bothering me. How can we live like this? How can anybody live like this? It's not living, but... Since the last Games, something is different. I can see it. What can you see? Hope. You understand that whatever I do comes back to you and Mom. I don't want you to get hurt. You don't have to protect me. Or Mom. We're with you. I love you. I love you, too. PLUTARCH: The broadcast cut out here. Before any of the excitement happened. How many people saw it? Hard to say. There was a five second delay, but it happened fast. If you cannot contain Katniss Everdeen, then I will have to terminate her. I understand that. And not just her. Her entire species has to be eliminated. Her species, sir? The other Victors. Now, because of her, they all pose a threat. Because of her, they all think they're invincible. Whatever game you think you're playing, those out there are not playing it with you. There's a way we can still win. It's what we Gamemakers like to call "a wrinkle." (CROWD CHEERING) Ladies and gentlemen, this is the 75th year of The Hunger Games. And it was written in the charter of The Games that every 25 years, there would be a Quarter Quell to keep fresh for each new generation the memory of those who died in the uprising against The Capitol. Each Quarter Quell is distinguished by Games of a special significance. And now on this, the 75th anniversary of our defeat of the rebellion, we celebrate the 3rd Quarter Quell (CROWD CHEERING) as a reminder that even the strongest cannot overcome the power of The Capitol. On this, the 3rd Quarter Quell Games, the male and female Tributes are to be reaped from the existing pool of Victors in each district. (AUDIENCE CLAMORING) MRS. EVERDEENI No! Who does he mean? SNOW: Victors shall present themselves on Reaping Day -regardless of age... - PRIM: Katniss... -(MRS. EVERDEEN SOBBING) -...state of health -or situation. -(YELLS) (PANTING) No. Peeta. (BOTTLES CLINKING) Ah. There she is. Finally did the math, huh? And you've come to, what? Ask me to... Die? I'm here to drink. Oh. Finally, something I can help you with. What's it say that Peeta was here 45 minutes ago begging to save your life and you only just now show up? It means we have to save him. You could live 100 lifetimes and never deserve that boy. Come on, Haymitch. Nobody decent ever wins The Games. Nobody ever wins The Games. Period. There are survivors. There's no winners. Peeta has to survive. We have to do whatever it takes to save him. (SIGHS) All right, if... If they call his name, I'll volunteer in his place. Haymitch, thank you. But they call my name and Peeta volunteers, there's nothing I can do. You can help him in the arena. Like you did for me. Ah... I think these Games are gonna be different. I don't care. Do whatever you can. Peeta lives. Not me. Promise me. Okay. (SOFTLY) We should've gone when you said. EFFIE: Welcome. Welcome. As we celebrate the 75th anniversary and 3rd Quarter Quell of The Hunger Games. As always, ladies first. The female Tribute from District 12, Katniss Everdeen. Wonderful. (CLEARS THROAT) And now for the men. The male Tribute from District 12. (SIGHS) Haymitch Abernathy. I volunteer as Tribute. I can't let you do that. You can't stop me. - Peeta. - Let go. Very well. The Tributes from District 12. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. Well, all that remains is... Oh, no. But, but, but... Katniss! - I get to say goodbye. - Katniss! New plan. Straight to the train. No, I have to say goodbye. Katniss! No. Good bye! EFFIE: All right. (CLEARS THROAT) Before we begin, I've had a thought. You don't say? Katniss has her gold Mockingjay pin. I have my hair. I'm going to get you two boys something gold. Uh... Why is that? A token. Show them we are a team. And they can't just... Thank you. All right. Now... (EXHALES) Everything will be different, because it's a Quarter Quell. The Capitol has spared no expense. A new training center. New Tribute living quarters. And of course, a very special arena. But this year you'll be facing other Victors. Capitol favorites. Smart, cunning, skilled. And they all know one another. You two are the outsiders. I want you guys to forget everything you think you know about The Games. Last year was child's play. This year, you're dealing with all experienced killers. All right. What does that mean for us? That means you're gonna have to have some allies. Okay. I think that if... Whoop. You're not the problem. No. Look, you're starting at a disadvantage. Most of these people have been friends for years. That just puts us higher on their kill list. Do it your own way, but I know these people. You go it alone, their first move is gonna be to hunt you down. Both of you.
