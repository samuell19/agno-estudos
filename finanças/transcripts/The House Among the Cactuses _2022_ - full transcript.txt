I have bananas, apples... Girl, do you want a flower? They're in season. The oranges... -Good. -And the apples. Thanks a lot. Dad, they gave me this -They gave it to you? -Yes. -What a nice lady, eh? -She was really friendly. One day all the sisters can come. One day. It's strange that they're not back. Iris, I'm going to look for them. -Do we have dinner? -Yes, go ahead. Lis! Lis! What happened? Lis! Lis! Lis! Go! Out of the way! Go to your room! Lis! Careful! Careful! Be careful. We should've taken her to a hospital. -We could've taken her. -Hold on, Lis. Hold on. What's wrong with Lis? I don't know. THE HOUSE AMONG THE CACTUSES -Lila, Dalia, your time's up. -Wait. We'll show them. Come on. Lila above and Dalia below. Now why? -You saw my freckle. -No. What then? -I have powers. -Liar! I'm Margarita! -Where was it? -In the bathroom. You can't be Margarita like this. Magic bracelets are never taken off. Right? You're not the same, you're unique. Each one is as they are. -Come on, Dalia. -Go on, breakfast. You're dancing with the only pretty girl in the room. She's the most beautiful creature I've seen in my life. When Darcy gets to the door... -Are you at the best bit? -Which one? -When Lidia leaves. -That's not the best bit. Yes, it is, because you always cry. No. I cry at the end. Now you're Darcy. Now you're Elizabeth. -Now you're a lettuce. -Iris, Melisa. Come on, breakfast. I have a shift until eight. Let's see how it goes today. Yesterday I put gas in 4 or 5 cars, no truck. What's going to happen? I don't think they close. I'll ask at the garage. Or in town. We won't go hungry. We have land. Hey, you have class, a special class. -Give me the book. -You've got a show. Do you know it or not? -Do you know it or not? -I know it. -Stop. -No. Can I do it? That's it. -No. -Let me. -No. -Lila. -Let me. -Stop. -Stop. -Lila. Lila. Lila, Lila, Lila... Whose turn is it today? Who's Margarita? -Dalia. -Go on. -Lila. -It's your turn. -Leave me alone. -Rosa. -No, it's your turn. -Let's go. It's your turn. Mila! Mila! Let's go. Girls, girls, come on. To the room. Let's go. Go. -When can we all be together? -Someday. Will you give me a kiss? 'Bye. Here you have homework for the summer. If you have any doubts, help each other or ask mum or dad. -I want you to come in summer. -Melisa, my girl, summer is to have fun, do other things. If you like, go with your dad to the gas station and call me. -Who is this for? -For everyone. Try them on and choose what suits you. -Didn't they close the store? -No, no way. -No? -You get by. The play "The Soldier and the Young Lady" begins. Soldier, soldier Where do you come from? From the war, miss What do you seek? Did you ever see my husband In the war? I cannot recall Describe him to me -You should start a school. -Yes, just what I needed. Yes, some may say that it's savagery or barbarity, for savages and barbarians what I have in town. Until now I hadn't realized how big they are. I know they're doing very well here, Rosa, but one day they'll have to fly... and meet other people, have other experiences. Yes, that time will come. All in good time. From your description Your husband is dead No. He was killed in Valencia, in the house of the Genovese. Will you plait my hair? The man and woman had a twofold mission. The first was to fill the Earth with life. With lots of boys and girls. Exactly, with lots of boys and girls. And the second part of the mission consisted of subduing the soil, caring for it and cultivating it. They had to leave everything behind and so be united in their mission. Thus, they created a new world. -Tomorrow the magic beans. -Yes. It was your sister's favorite. Tomorrow can we make a flower necklace for Lis? Of course. She'll be very happy. -Can she still be happy? -Yes, honey. Done? Done. I'm beat. Not me. Inside. Not me. No! Stop! Dalia! -Lila! -What's wrong? Get inside. Melisa, come. -Mum, someone's there. -Yes. Shut Lila in. -Why? -Look, I got a scratch. -Hello! -Hello. Sorry, could you help me, please? What do you need? I'm a bit lost. May I? Yes. -Hello. -Hello. I'm trying to get to Firgas. I've been walking for days, but I think I'm lost. This isn't the way. -No? -No. Forgive me. -Hello. -Hello. We're here. -Let's see. -No? More or less. More or less, yes. We're around here. And Firgas... is straight ahead. Yes, but you can't go this way because the road is cut off. It's cut off? Yes, you'd have to take some trails that go up that way and lead to the ravine, and that'd force you to go a long way around. -Okay. Thanks. -You're welcome. Could I get some water, please? -Yes, of course. -Thank you. Come. Get him a towel. I made it. It's very nice. Thank you. Iris. I'm Rafa. -And you? -She's Margarita. I'm Melisa. Nice to meet you. -You're going to hit nightfall. -Yes. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Goodbye. -Dad. -Hello. -Dad. -Hello. -Who are you? -This is Rafa. My name's Rafa. I got lost and your wife helped me. -She gave me some water. -Are you hungry? -Can he stay for dinner? -Let him stay for dinner, please. -Let him stay for dinner. -Yes, he can stay. -Please. -Do you want him to stay? -Yes. -Please. -Well, come in. -Thank you. -Go ahead. -Come in. He's having dinner with us, I know you like him. -Did you play a lot. -I like him. -I saw the lizard. -The lizard? Really? -Yes. -It's always the same one. -The one from the other day? -I think so. -They're a bit off, eh? -I bet it wasn't the same one. -Shall we look for sticks tomorrow? -Alright. This map is old. You've got trails this way, but they're goat trails. -Here's impossible, there's a ridge. -But... -No, not that. -...the trails... They're... Look, I'd take this detour that takes you here, to a clearing that goes along the slope. -But I have to go all the way back. -Yes. This way is impossible. Beer? Okay. Thanks. Oh, it's you? You've got a scratch. -Does it hurt? -I did it in the garden. Margarita. Go and help. Plates. -We need more plates. -Coming. Thanks. -Can I use the bathroom? -First door on the left. Mum made you a sandwich because the man's still here. Are you going? -It was all delicious. -Shared bread is always better. Do you want to try my donuts? No. -Why not? -Because they're terrible. That's not true, Mum and Dad love them. -When they're fresh out of the oven. -They're a bit hard. -But Mum, it's your recipe. -But yours turn out hard. Alright, I'll try them. -Try them, try them. -Try it. Is it good? What do you do? Study? Teaching, I'm in 2nd year. I'm going to be a sculptor. Mila told me. I saw what you do outside. It's really good. -You should have an exhibition. -One day she will. You have friends in Firgas. They're from Madrid, but they live here now. -We can take you to the clearing. -Yes, with a goat. Explain it to him. We took the trail once to go to the clearing and we ran into a goat. We caught it... Well, it followed us down the trail. -Because you gave it an apple. -But it was already following us. I gave it to her halfway down the trail, about. But yes, and I put it in Iris' room. Animals have to be outside. And you girls, off to bed. -A bit longer. -No, everyone off to bed. -Do you want some food for tomorrow? -No. There's no need. -Have a good trip, Rafa. 'Bye. -'Bye. -Say goodbye to the man. -'Bye, Rafa. -Good bye. -Good bye. Will you come with me? -Thanks. -You're welcome. Good luck. This way. -You have a lovely family. -Yes. And it's good to be able to raise them here, no? Yes. We have the help of a teacher in town too. It's very worthy. Well, it has its good and bad things. I imagine. This is what I can offer you. It's not a bed, but at least you won't sleep rough. Set out early, the sun is scorching here. -Thanks. -Good luck. What are you doing here? I brought you this. You look a lot like Darcy. You remind me of him. Thank you. Are you leaving tomorrow? I want to go with you. Ma'am! Ma'am! Good Morning. Good Morning. Could I take a cold water splash before I go? Yes, of course. There's a hose in the garden. Thanks. Could you bring me some colored bottles? -Bottles. -Like the ones you brought me that time. You have all kinds. But the caramel-colored ones... Do you remember? Caramel, caramel... Emilio, he hasn't gone yet. He wants to shower outside with the hose. Well... -I'll drive him. -Yes, good. It's done, it's done. It's done. Rosa. Rosa. I have to go. But he can't go like this, look at his arm. Right. -Let me treat him and let him go. -Yes, he has to go. Well, good luck for you. 'Bye. -'Bye, Dad. -Good bye. That's it. What are you doing, eh? What are you doing? Don't you know the rules? To your room, and no noise. -Remember the bottles! -Yes. This is almost done. But you have to treat it, okay? Your daughters will've been pricked a lot by the cacti from there outside. Yes. But if it doesn't get infected, you'll be fine. Melisa knows a lot about that, right, Mum? Why? Melisa always plays with the cactuses and one time... Iris! Go see what's going on. This will sting a bit. I'll be right back, excuse me. Melisa, stop that. Iris. Iris! Iris! Come here. Come here. Dalia. Hello. Do you want to see my drawings? Sure. Home, now! These are lightnings. I made them so that Margarita wouldn't be afraid. and so she'd see that they're just lines. These are cactus flowers which only come out at night. This is Margarita. This is the tree in the yard, It's that tall since I was born. This is Margarita I did it with watercolor. And I went with the water and it has been so rough, look at it. Dad... and Lis. But I like this one better. Who's Lis? Our older sister. She died last year. May I? How old was she? Two years older than Iris. MARGARITA - TWINS ISOLATED I have to go. I don't like that boy. Where are you going? Why did you come here, eh? Why did you come? Where are you going with that? Give me that. Where are you going with that? -Who are you? -And you? Wait! Shit, shit! Shit! Now what? What do we do? What do we do now? What do we do? -What are we going to do? -Be quiet. -Take it easy. -What are we going to do? -He had it all there. -We're going to think. What do we do? -What are we going to do? -We're going to think. Did you see? Did you? He had all the names, all of them. -Quiet. Quiet. -He has them all here. And I don't know why. -Why is he here? Why? -Quiet, quiet. He was in there. Why? We'll make it out of this. That's it, that's it. If you hadn't come, what would've happened? Do you know he stole my drawing of Lis? -Mum was with Margarita. -Yes, he's a thief. But why did he cheat us? -He could've hurt us... -Alright, alright! Isn't what he's done to us enough?! Get me a bucket. Can I tell you something? Of course. I asked him if I could go with him. But I got scared and left. People sometimes aren't what they seem. But we were nice to him. We fed him... -You treated his... -Sure, sure. It's a shame, but... You can't trust anyone, that's the way it is. I knew he was bad. What don't you understand? He's dangerous. Shut the window, please. Get him out of my room, call the police, he'll go to jail. No, you don't get it. You see what state he is in? Don't you see it? Don't you see it? He is going to call the police. I'm the one who's going to end up in jail. But you just wanted to protect Mum. Tell them the truth. The truth... What truth?! What truth?! What truth? Water. Who are you? Who else knows you're here? Water. -Water. -Answer me. Nobody. Water. He can't leave.

The fridge is still leaking water. Yeah? The transformer's coming today. I'll see you later, okay? It'll all be fine. 'Bye. Mum, can I call Mila? Sure, whenever you like. But I don't know if it's a good time now that she's on holiday. She told me I could call her whenever I liked. Why do you want to call her? To find out something, or to see how she is? I don't know, I'd like to call her and talk to her. You're worried, honey, eh? You know you can talk to me whenever you want, right? No one in this world loves you and understands you and protects you more than your family. You do know that? I'll treat him and he can go.

But go, put on your pajamas. -And you, get out. -A bit longer. Are you Lis' brother? Yes. My parents aren't her parents? No. I want my mother to know. Help me. And me? Help me... please. Mum. Mum, Dad. -What's wrong? -I don't know. Rafa. Go to bed, I'll be right there. Get me out of here, please. I would've liked to have a son. Emilio too. He doesn't say it, but I know he would have. I remember when the twins arrived. Emilio had a baby in each arm and we thought they were two boys. He's a good father, he's always helped me. With two babies at the same time and three little girls everything was complicated. Many effort and sacrifices. But there's nothing better in the world. You shouldn't have come. We were doing fine here. -Are you sad? -No. -Are you afraid? -Afraid of what? I don't know. I don't know what's up with me, but I don't like Rafa being here in the bedroom, alone. I feel sorry for him. I know he has deceived us and hurt Mother, but... Have you see him? I saw you come in. Iris, he's fine. When the frog started snoring The fly came and made him be quiet The fly went to the frog who was sitting And singing under the water When the fly started singing The spider came and made him be quiet The spider went to the fly The fly to the frog who was sitting When Lila and Dalia stopped singing They had to go to bed Come on, off to bed. Iris, Iris, aren't you eating? I've got a stomach ache. And on that ground, only Noah knew that the universal flood would come. And they warned him, "Noah, if you want to save yourself and your family, you'll have to build a giant ark. And he began to build the ark. He spent years and years building it.

Get out of the car! Get in! Iris! -Where is he? Where is he? -But how could you go looking for Mila? -Where is he?! -He's gone, he's gone! He can't have gone, he was tied up! Where is he? Where is he? He was here, he was dying! -No, no! -Into your room! It's over! Enough! He left! I saw him. He had dinner here with us and then he robbed us. When I came home I found him on the path. I saw him hit Rosa and... I reacted badly. I can't believe that this happened here. -Nothing ever happens here. -No. But maybe you're right, one shouldn't be so trusting. -These days have been horrible. -Yes. And the girls are very upset. Well, Mila, thanks for everything. I'm sorry. Come, I'll see you out. Rest up and take care of the girls. Anything you need, just tell me. Melisa, come on, we're going. -Don't you have gaskets? -If there are not there, no. -This is the transformer 125 to 220? -Yes. POST OFFICE -There you go. -That's good. There. -Hello. -Mila.
