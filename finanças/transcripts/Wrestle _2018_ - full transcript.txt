[indistinct chatter] [man 1]Come on, come on, come on. You know, I know you got this. Come on. -[thunder rolls] -Here we go. Come on. -[indistinct chatter] -You don't wanna let go. Yeah, you got to keep your pace going. Come on. [overlapping dialogue] -[man 2] Let's keep going. -[man 3] Let's go! -[man 2] Come on, Jamario. -[man 3] Let's go! [man 2] You gotta fight for it, go. [overlapping dialogue] [man 3] We're the state champs. -Let's go! -[all groaning] -[man 3] Let's go! Let's go! -[man 4] Go! [screaming] [overlapping dialogue] [man 5] Heads up! Get up. Let's go. [Chris] Let's go. Stand. Breathe, breathe, breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe. [man 6] Go water it down. Breathe as you walk. Breathe as you walk. [Jamario]I will never quit anything. When I'm hurt, I still push and push through it. I have to fight my way up. And now... I'm here. [wings flapping] [tense music] [Chris] Why do we fight? There is no other team in two years of existence, that without a youth program, or like a beautiful facility, that has done what you all have done. If you keep coming in here grinding every day, you're gonna get top of the state. When you feel like skipping fourth block, when you feel like taking it off a year. Remember... it's not about you. It's about the opportunity that you've been given to be great. For those of you who did not buy what we're selling, I promise you this. You will live the rest of your life regretting it. For those of you who buy what we're selling, and when you get that scholarship, and when you get that job, and when you provide for your kids, you will understand why we fought. [Chris] You ready? Wrestle. [razor buzzing] -I have prayers today. -Yep. One more thing about Jailen, he guarantee he get a haircut every week. Lot of teammates gonna keep no appointment but they ain't good, he's very punctual, too. He say, he coming here in five minutes, he'd be here in five minutes. [clicks tongue] You know, I sleep here sometimes, bro. [stutters] But it's getting a little messy. All right, so... this is like a self-portrait. [Jailen] This is first place, third place, third place, second place. This is, uh, this thing I did last summer. I had to talk about, "Why my life matters?" And I say, "My life matters because I stand as a symbol of hope. I'm a young man who is self-motivated and full of confidence. There are some who put me down, so I wanna show my doubters that I am somebody. I have a commitment to fulfill as a black male or not let the African-American race down by becoming an ever menace to society." [claps, clicks tongue] [Chris]All the way around, team. Why you bending at the elbow? -[Jailen] Arms forward. -[Chris] Arms straight. After arms forward. [Chris] There you go. All the way around there you go. Shon'D, Jailen, nice. Lavanze, nice. -[groans] -Tyrik, nice. Thirteen! [all] Thirteen! [Jaquan] I think he's double jumped to be two steps, right. [creaking] Oh, come on. I'm gonna get this. [Sheba] Jaquan, why are you on punishment? [chuckles] I don't know what it feel like trying to let... [Sheba] Why? Why not? 'Cause I... 'cause I had to skip school, as well. Oh, he the man, he'd grown. [clicks tongue] So he leave and got caught. My sister caught his butt. Just cause you have good grades in school, that's not all that matters. You know what I thought about Jaquan? -[Jaquan mumbles] -The weirdest child, he's got to be the weirdest because I'm thinking... he was gonna do basketball, he was gonna do football... Let me check my shrimp. [Jaquan] I did play basketball and football. But when he told me wrestling, I was like, "Wrestling? -Are you serious?" -[chuckles] So, don't take this the wrong way. [stutters] Somewhere in my head, it's just, "I got a white son." [laughs] You were a little white boy trapped inside a little black boy's body. This one, I won my first tournament. And there's a lazy boy right there. [Jaquan's brother] It's just bronze. -That's gold. -[Jaquan's brother laughs] That's all gold. [Chris] Everybody roll! Everybody counting! Everybody jacksing! Everybody sprawling. -[all] Four, three, two, one. -[Chris] Teague. -I'm not playing with you. -[all] Seven, six... -[Chris] Teague! -[all] ...five, four, three, two, one. [birds chirping] [dogs barking] [Teague's mother] How are you gonna get down? -Huh? -How are you going to get down? [Teague] Wrestling is all I used to do. I actually had nicknames, Hercules, Muncher, and pretty much like... freaking boss names. I would have all my medals, but when my dad got arrested, he got them like, confiscated, and then, they were just got lost. [Teague] As of, right now, I'm on four meds, but I don't take them. It helps with my behavior and, uh... And my, me focusing, that's better, but I don't usually take it. [Chris] Guys, real quick. Before we start this practice, let's just get a general idea of the weight classes. So, I'm gonna divide you guys up along the wall by weight class. You guys are 106. You're 120. Leave a space right here. You're 126, right? Are you weighing now? Raise your hand if you have not yet got weight certified. I'm taking you guys, and Reuben... He's gonna get his shoulder press. ...and Jaquan... -[James] And Rowe. -...and Rowe. Where is Rowe? [indistinct chatter] -Priorities straight. -What's going on? [Lolitia] Man, I'm not gonna be-- [Lolitia] No, you're saying one thing, and she's saying something else. He specifically told them now, come and get me. And I said, "Okay." [Lolitia] No, you said they had no gas to bring you back. They didn't. [Lolitia muttering] [crows cawing] [telephone ringing] Hey. Yeah, Jamario here. All right. Let me see. [indistinct chatter from TV] Come on, mama. [Lolitia] [Jamario] Well... The girl ain't nothing but drama. She blows your phone up, she calls, she texts, but you're saying you're stressed out when you get 'em. I'm not the one stressing you. [tense music] [somber music] [car door closes] [car revs] Practice is closed. Also, we just don't want, as a policy, girlfriends coming to practice, you know what I'm saying? 'Cause that gets weird, you know. [Chris] I don't want Jamario, in the middle of his practice, to be talking to his girlfriend. -I'm not going to, man. -That's all I'm saying. -I'm not going to. -Does that make sense? I want him to be focused during practice. -All right? -[Jamario] You sit over here. [indistinct chatter] One minute, y'all. One minute! -[Chris] Go. -[all] One. -Go. -[all] Two. -Go. -[all] Three. -Go. -[all] Four. I got with him when he was 13, I was 14. We had curfew. [chuckles] You're see it off the phone, so, we had to wait for them to go to bed, and... "What would you do, best friend?" [Samara] He's such... I mean, everybody doesn't see this, but he's really an amazing person. [mumbles] This could be the first male to graduate from high school, out of his family, and the first to go to college. And I guess that's putting a lot of stress on him, too, 'cause he just wants his family to be proud of him. [Chris] Come on. Twenty seconds. Both of y'all first in the family to get a scholarship. Keep it up! Ten seconds, ten seconds. Come on. Five, four, three, two, one. Good job. Where did you get the socks from? [Jailen] Uh... DICK's. Sport DICK's. You got Spiderman on the back of them. Well, is that about some 20 dollar socks? -No, 15. -[grandfather] Fifteen? For some socks? -Please... -They bring me luck. -They do what? -They bring me luck. And? -Only ones you wear? -Every time. Okay. Well, this is, this is my whole nick of pins from my first season. And we get those after we pin a guy. You get a pin. -[whistle trills] -[Jailen] So... You are on points when you wrestle, and you can win by losing points, but what you really want is a pin. Basically, you get a guy on his back, shoulder blades touch the mat for five short seconds. One, two, three, four, five. -When we got there, its... -[snaps] That's the match, you know, you get your hand raised, go to coach, get your pin, put it where you want it. [bell ringing] [woman 1 over PA]Good morning, Jaguar Scholars. Welcome to another wonderful learning day after day! Where it is our business that all students... [background chatter] So, GDP is criticized because it measures the overall wealth of the country, but it doesn't take into account the distribution of income that some people in the country might have the vast majority of the wealth. [indistinct chatter] [Chris] Guys, we gotta check your weight. Every single day, we're gonna monitor weight where you're at. Dude, Jailen's gonna be huge. Look at him. -What? -[all laugh] [Chris] Jaquan, step on the scale. -Holy fuck. -[man 7] Shit boy. That is fucking crazy. Dude, you're ten motherfucking pounds overweight. Let's go. Now. [whirring] When I see the sweat, drip off your nose and not your chin, go two more minutes harder and then stop. [Chris] Teague. -Teague. -[loud thud] Teague, put it down. I stuck my leg in. -All right. Make sure it's down. -You all right there? [exhales] This is like... Yeah, this is an improved banana split. All right, all right, all right. This is ain't called banana split. He can't do nothing about that. Guys, in a little less than three days, we're gonna be driving down as a whole team. To Birmingham. [Chris] This is our first big tournament. We want everyone who's scoring points in their weight class to place at this tournament.

Johnson High School on Huntsville. I'm Jamario's wrestling coach. [Fat Cat] Uh-huh. [Chris] Hey, sir, I just want to tell you that your grandson, Jamario, is one of the best wrestlers in all of Alabama this year. -[Fat Cat] Oh, that's great. -Yes. That's very, that's very impressive. And I've been waiting for years to hear something like this. If there's any way you would be able to come here, we could even, maybe, pick you up. [Fat Cat] Right into my house? So you could see Jamario wrestle. [Fat Cat]Well, I sure would like to go. Wow, that's awesome. Wait, do you want to talk to your grandson? He's in the car. [Fat Cat] Yeah. Let me talk to him. [Chris] All right. [calm music] [chuckles] [calm music] -[laughter] -[overlapping dialogue] [Sheba] How much weight, Jaquan? So you gotta lose four pounds? Well, no burrito for you. [chuckles] I'm not eating the whole thing. I'm just like gonna eat about until right here. [background chatter] [Sheba] You gotta work it out now because you gonna go back down there and work out some more. [Jaquan] Well, yeah. 'Cause I'm 139. -[Sheba] What is that? -[Jaquan's brother] 139. [Sheba] 139? -[Jaquan] Yeah. -[Jaquan's brother] Yeah. [Sheba] You went up. Uh-huh. Yeah. [Sheba] [all laugh] [Chris] It's great to meet you, Fat Cat, it's an honor. -How are you doing? -I'm all right. I'm Chris. You can call me Coach Chris. -All right. -[laughing] So you know, ain't no mountain high enough, is it? -[Lolitia] Oh, my Jesus. -It ain't nobody low. -[both laughing] -It got to go. [Fat Cat] I love you, Lolitia. I'm glad I'm alive to see this. This is a dream come true. Now, you stay in the right-hand lane. You must be reading the newspaper online. Stay at the right-hand lane and elbow. That mean, you keep straight going elbow. You didn't go the direct... Just take straight. -[Chris] Okay. -You don't understand, huh? -Oh. -The old school's -not good really. -Oh, okay. -You understand like I do? -Oh, okay. -[Chris] I'm learning, Jamario. -I'll break... -[Chris] I'm learning. -I'll break it down. Yeah, break it down a little bit. We're going down here on highway. -[Chris] No, I got you. -Oh, okay. [giggling] Wow. Yeah, he's, he's from New York. [cell phone dial ringing] Jaquan. Stop being a dickhead. Stop fucking pissing me off. [Chris] You've got a tournament, make the way. Thank you. [car engine revving] You're not gonna lose any weight like this, though. You don't lose weight by like softly pedaling. [Chris] I'll help you make it, weigh in. We'll see where you're at, and then, I'll tell you what you need to do. It's not gonna be that crazy. [Chris] Okay. So you have... Wow, you have five pounds to lose right now. So you... [Jaquan] No. I'm gonna get to 132. [tense music] [Chris] Jaquan, if you don't make it, you forfeit, and that ruins your shot at State. Okay, come on. You got this, Jaquan. You lost anything? [Jailen] He's been doing this mostly. It is on your job, man. You can do it, bro. Hold up here. See, that's full speed. [Sheba] And I know you. I know my child. You can handle this. -Just do what he says. -This is nasty. But also, I don't... I don't... -[Jamario] All right. Now, go. -[Chris] Go for it. -[water splatters] -[all groans] -[Sheba] Y'all sound silly. -That is disgusting! -[Sheba] That was so silly. -Ew! -That was nasty? -That was sweat. [all groan] [Chris] I'm estimating he's got a pound to go. No. [stutters] -He made it? -I don't think he made it. -How much did he have? -Four pounds. -I think he made it. -I don't think he made it. [Chris] All right, guys. Go to bed. -Come on. -No. You gotta get up at 7:00. [indistinct chatter] [suspenseful music] Go into the weighing room and say you're weighting on the scale. Booth. Hey, sweat first. [indistinct chatter] Jaquan Rhodes. -Yeah! -Yes, sir! [Chris] [commentator 1] Welcome to the first wrestling tournament of the season. Today, each wrestler will earn his initial state ranking. By the end of the season, they will have to make it to the top eight in their weight class to qualify for the state championships. All right, Johnson, in on me, real quick. I wanna beat Grissom so bad. I went to the coach 'cause he won all these state championships, I said, "Coach, I wanna start a wrestling team in Johnson." And he looked at me, and he said, "There is no way you will ever get more than one or two kids at Johnson to wrestle." [Chris] Have faith that you guys can perform beyond what you're expected to. Hands in. [all] Bring us the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. -One, two, three! -[all] Jags! Very strong kid. Literally just, he just pinned Jaq in 30 seconds. He's not gonna stop your takedown, but his tug is on top. He's not gonna make a single mistake... [tense music] [shouting indistinctly] [inhales sharply] [whistle blows] There you go. He's just backing up, Jailen He's just backing up. Keep circling in, your offense. -There you go. Close in. -[whistle blows] Sway side to side, he's just backing up. [whistle blows] [Chris] Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Keep him in! Keep him in! Keep him in, Jailen! Move on your right, Jailen! Your shoulders should stay in. [whistle blows] [Chris] Jailen, Jailen, you've got 30 seconds -to show us something. -[whistle blows] Push it there, right there. Set it, set it, set it. -[whistle blows] -[crowd cheering] Good job. [Chris] Jaquan, you're up. Here we go. [whistle blows] [Chris] Yes, pull your offense. Let him go. [screaming] [groans] [Chris] Yeah, lift, lift. -Yep, he's giving it to you. -[Sheba] Don't sit back... Yep. All right, behind that left ear. Yes, right there. Step it away. Step off the way. [Sheba] Yeah. -[whistle blows] -[Chris screaming] [crowd cheering] Hey, good job. Way to stayed calm. Thank you. [all jabbering] [jabbering continues] Come on, Teague. [commentator 2] Teague Berres from J.O. Johnson High School, please report to the second mat. [Teague's mother]His very first match he was five years old. The kid pinned him so quickly, he came straight back up and he was like, "Mama, I'm not ever gonna get pinned again." And that year, he didn't. You can do all your crazy stuff do whatever you want, you just can't go to your butt or your back. [Teague] You what I'm gonna do? Make that banana split that I do. -[chuckles] -And then, then do a point-- I think he's probably gonna see that coming but I'm gonna let you, whatever you wanna do, just do not go to your back, okay? [whistle blows] Let's go to your one, here. Teague, just... -What are you doing? -Come on, Teague. -Come on, Jaquan! -Don't let him do that! [Chris] Teague, you can't grab him through a spiral. Teague, you can't-- You can't grab him through a spiral. I'm about to say you're out the match. If you ever talk back to me, I'm gonna take you out the match. Go wrestle. [whistle blows] [whistle blows] What the fuck? [Chris] Teague, go get your suit off, you're not wrestling, you're done. Look, this is good, 'cause y'all true colors are... they're really coming out right now, and we're gonna have to improve as a team. [Chris] Jamario, stand up. Start getting athletic. Start moving your feet. I'm just, I'm worried. He's so unprepared for his next match, he could lose it. Come on. let's go. [whistle blows] [overlapping dialogue] -[Chris] Keep going! Keep go-- -[crowd gasp] [Chris] Right there! Bring it in. Bring it in. -Bring it in. -[grunts] [Chris] No, no, no. Look at me, bro. Bro, look at me! You're fine! You're doing good. Look at me, hey! Bring him in, bring him in. [tense music] Okay. [whistle blows] Come here. Come here, Jamario. He just wanna beat you up. You didn't wanna be here. He just woke you up. I don't want you to leave here disappointed. I want you to leave here in a way that you can be proud of yourself. Go hard. Stay off the knees. Let's go. [Chris clapping] [whistle blows] [tense music] -[whistle blows] -[crowd cheering] [laughs] [mellow music] This is the first time in three years. I was like, "Dang, I'm coaching a wrestling team." First time. Guys, we're taking this all the way to State. [Chris] What that's gonna take is pushing each other in every practice. And each and every one of you place the top eight in your weight class. Basically, I'm gonna... be a dad soon. Girlfriend got pregnant. [clears throat] She is... two months. [Jamario] Yeah, it's been kinda rough for me lately. [sighs, clicks tongue] That was my biggest worry, his gettin' a baby but... they wanna be so grown, so now... [Jamario mutters] ...it's here that we have to deal with it. I mean, it's their baby, not mine. They gonna finish schooling. -They gonna... Uh-uh. He cannot. -[Samara mumbles] How you gonna take care of that baby with no job or nothing to, to bring to the table? 'Cause I'm not gonna put my life on hold and raise your baby. I'm gonna break the cycle, 'cause I'm serious. [Lolitia] What's the cycle? What is the-- The cycle is, a cycle is something that can't stop, that's gonna continue on going down the freaking family tree. So that means, you're gonna be in your child's life? [Jamario] Yeah. Somebody that my dad is not. That's all you gotta say. I'm not gonna be a deadbeat dad. I'm not gonna... Right, I'm gonna be the first male to go to college and actually be successful so the cycle is broken. It's broken. [Jailen's uncle] When he was little, He was still... the little quiet guy that he is. He's always been a really nice guy, very malleable. Just quiet. And a lot will tell you, really didn't even know that he was around. His father was in the navy, his mother... she said that she would take care of the kids. Their mom, she just disappeared. No, I haven't, I haven't seen my mom since. I'll say when I was two. I haven't seen my mom in a long time. [Jailen] She got a new husband, and, uh, she had two new sons. But my dad always told me, like, "You never let anybody see you, like, crying." [sighs deeply] [car alarm wailing] [cellphone vibrating] [Jaquan] Oh, shit. Scrib calling. That's great. Um, I'm on my way. Gimme like, gimme like, two minutes. Dude, get your big ass head off of me. I'm tired. [indistinct chatter] You're 15 minutes late. You told me you won't be late anymore. You're doing extra, extra work now. [door slams] [Chris] Now, go! Fourteen. Stand up! -Teague, sound off to 14, go! -Come on, Teague! Way to work defense! One, low. That's important. [Teague's mother] I just don't know what to do. Now, you're not even going to the classes. You were already held back in seventh grade. [grunts, blows raspberry] You get held back in ninth grade. That will put you at, like, 20 when you graduate, if you graduate. Which would make you ineligible to even wrestle. Which means any help of a scholarship would be out the door. Maybe if you weren't getting high, you could wrestle to your fullest. Hm? [chuckles] I don't really like wrestling anymore. It's not that fun. Ten years ago, today, I got sober. I got kicked out of high school for continuing drink and drug despite many interventions. I would make these sweeping proclamations that I, you know, I was gonna quit for good this time and then... two weeks later, not even, sometimes, two days later, two hours later I'd find myself loaded on something. [Chris] I've realized that I've been trying to fill that hole with, you know, teaching and coaching as much as possible, and I'm only 28, so... I need to be grateful for the sobriety that I have. [indistinct chatter] No, man. Teague, run with us. [Teague] I already ran two. Yeah, we're doing eight. -[Teague] I'm not doing eight. -Come on. I can't do it, nope. -Sprinted two miles. -I know, so do two slowly. Come on. -[Teague] I will do two. -[Chris] All right, let's go. All right, man, if you feel good, do another one. Come on, just one at a time. -[Teague] Oh, my god. -One at a time. Believe in yourself, come on. Teague, that's not... [sighs] All right.

And in some cases, assigned them to even more segregated educational... [overlapping chatter] [Chris] You know the Johnson has the highest concentration of poverty in Huntsville right now, right? We're gonna have to raise the money. -[Jailen] Teague, you hear that? -Oh, Jailen. Jailen, are you ready to speak? -Speak about? -[background chatter] What do I speak about?

I'd like to welcome each of you to our facility today. I'd like to let Jailen tell you a most inspiring message. Well, I do wanna start by saying, College, it wasn't even considered as a journey for me. I just think after high school, I maybe work a low-income job. After the wrestling team at our school, I won't just go to college. I know I'd go... Be a, more of a role model. Not just for myself but for my community. [all applauding] [faucet whirring] [Sheba] Every time you try to do something good you have a breakthrough at something positive that you trying to do. It seems like everything comes and gets in your way. That's why I said, "Never get behind me." That's my saying. "Never get behind me." 'Cause he's not gonna stake... take my word.

I wanna be given my rights. That's what I'm saying. You got anything else inside in the vehicle... No, I didn't even use them, sir. What are you doing? [mumbling] [tense music] [Sheba] I'm pissed. My nerves is bad, I'm kinda shaky. I'm ready for this officer to call me so... I think going down to the... They gonna take him to the detention home. -[phone beeps] -[dial tone ringing] -[Jamario over phone] Hello. -Hey. Jamario. Hello? [Jamario] Hey. You know Jaquan is on his way to jail, right? [Jamario] What? Jaquan is on his way to jail. [Jamario] For? Weed. They found weed. The police found weed in the car. Have you been smoking. at my baby's car? [Jamario] No. [Sheba] Jamario, don't lie. You, you telling me, you will have, you weren't smoking no weed in the car? [Jamario] No. Okay. That's all I need to know. [Jamario] Oh. [mumbles] All right. You all have a good night, okay? Have a good night. [phone beeps] I'm done. I'm not gonna entertain that. Because, I, I, I had to remember he's a child. And I didn't wanna snap on him by that. So that's why I hung the phone up. [car door clicks] [Sheba] Oh, Lord, give me strength. Lord, have a peaceful mind. Not, do not jeopardize my freedom, Lord. In Jesus name, Amen. [car engine revving] [door buzzes] All right. You hadn't been 18, your ass would've been steel up dead in Madison County Jail. And all the reason why you're not up at the D home right now is because the probation officer said I had to come get you tonight, 'cause I was gonna make your ass stay up there. I don't deserve this. You treat me worse than the men in my life have treated me. And that hurts. It do. [sniffles] [indistinct chatter] [all] Three, two, one. Eight, seven, six... [James] Did it? It's illegal. You get caught with it in the next six months, you're going to jail. You get caught with it after those six months, and you're over 18, you're going to jail. There is no more college. They'll revoke every scholarship, every grant, every everything. You're done. Jamario? Sheba's inside. First, I'm going to start by saying... You already know the situation he in. -He's on probation now. -[Jamario] Mm-hm. [Sheba] I don't know how weed got in your car. I don't know how he got it in the car. 'Cause it was not, it was not in the car. It was not in the car at all. Well, I went back in the car again, and it is loud as hell. And then, you lied to me on the phone. I asked you, "Was you all smoking it?" And what did you tell me? Yeah. -Jamario. -You don't ask me one question -and... -Jamario. Jamario, don't do this. You don't want to go there with me. [Jamario] I know, okay. Don't go there with me, okay. I'm not... First, I'm a pissed off Mama right now. I'm disappointed in you guys. You will see if you have a baby. I'm looking forward to you being a mentor to him. He looks up to you whether you know it or not. -[snickers] -No, I don't. -It didn't stop there. -[all laugh] I was getting food stamps. Can't get food stamps now. 'Cause you got a drug charge. Now, I gotta go on a forsaken job... to keep a roof over our head. But the decisions that Jaquan made to go get high for that little amount of time, it cost me a whole life. It cost me a life. You got a baby to think about. Look around. Everybody out here loves you. You ain't my child, I ain't birth you but I love you. Can you be an example to him, too? [Sheba] You apologize to me and tell me you was sorry, Have you heard that come out from his mouth, yet? Not one time. I'm sorry. [Jailen] Hmm. [sighs] He got locked up when I was, hmm... Maybe... seven, eight years old? And I didn't see him until I was maybe like, twelve or one of those ages. And he told me, like, what's... my whole, like, seventh birthday was raised off drug money. I don't know if he still sell drugs, but... I wouldn't doubt it. McDonald's don't get you a lot of money. It don't. So you gotta pick up a side job. You gotta do something. [indistinct chatter] [Cooper] Hey. [Jailen] Have you seen Teague, Ms. Cooper? [Cooper] Have I seen Teague? No, I haven't seen Teague. Have you seen him? I saw him this morning, walking down the hall. [door clacking] Hey, Kiara. You seen Teague? Out here? [Kiara] [Jailen] [man 10] Hey, does he know where? [Teague] [Teague] Oh, once we get on to the street up here, you'll have to stop, because the guy we're gonna get something from... [ominous music] [indistinct chatter] [car engine rumbling] Have you all seen two little boys walking around? [officer 2] No? Okay, thank you. [Teague's mother] Up until recently, I didn't want him to get arrested, but I'm getting to the point where I think it's gonna take something like that for it to click in him that he's doing wrong. [Teague's mother] Now, I'm worried about him, because he has all these issues and then, the way that his dad was with him. It's somewhat physically abusive but he was very, very mentally abusive. And Teague got a lot of that growing up. [tranquil music] [door creaks] [Sheba] Jaquan, can you pee? [Jaquan mumbles] Well, you need to go drink some water or something. [Sheba] [officer 3] [Jaquan] [officer 3] [wind howling] [humming] [Samara] When they told me about having a baby but it was like, gonna be like... after school and all that, but I feel like God wouldn't... but I felt like it's a blessing because it's not the baby's fault that it happened like this. I feel like God wouldn't bless me with the baby if it wasn't the right time. [Samara] Mom and Dad, didn't want me to be with Jamario. He said, in the Bible it says black and whites can't be together. No, it does not say that. The past year's been hard. [Chris] Rowe! You all right? Holy shit. You scared the shit out of me. [Jomario] Right, what... what are you talking about when you say you need help. What kind of help? [Jamario] Mentally? [Jamario] Come here. [Chris] You cannot join them, Jamario. Come on. [Chris] Rowe! Jesus! [mutters] [Jamario] It's okay. [sighs] [Chris] Let's go, Teague. We're right where we want to be. We're going for the big trophy now. Get up, get up! [Chris] At some point, you guys are all gonna be in tough spots. You can't lose your fire. [Chris] No matter where you're at in a match, you can always win. [people cheering] [whistle trills] Keep the leg up, keep the leg up. [whistle trills] [tense music] [Chris] Chili's, Chick-fil-A, Bojangles', Waffle House, -We're going Chick-fil-A. -I want Bojangles'. I'm taking you to Taco Bell/Bojangles'. [indistinct chatter] No! [police siren blares] Where's your coach and everybody at? Uh, I guess they're on their way home. -Not home, but to the hotel. -To the hotel? [officer 4] You got a contact number for him? -Yup. -[officer 4] Go and call him. Because they're gonna come and get you -or you're going to jail. -All right. For urinating in public. Hold it. Get in front of the car. Stand right there in front of my car. Oh, boy. Oh, my god. [clicks tongue] [officer 4] I'm sorry. All right, I don't know who you're calling. J-A-I-L-E-N. Young. -J-A... -I-L-E-N. Young. -What's your last name. -Young. -Young. Big or small. -I just spelled it. -I just asked you. -[Jailen] Shut up. -Shut up. -You, you about this close. -Shut up, bro, I'm talking. -Okay. So you need to lose the attitude. Stand back here. Stand back here, at the back of the car. Put your hands on your back. You getting all this? I hope you are. 'Cause you can show this in your documentary. How disrespectful this young man has been. Did you get all that? 402. [police radio chatter] My mama wouldn't know or care. Do what? She won't know or care what you were doing. [man 11] Huh? [man 11] He don't know... -She just... -[man 10] Maybe not in... not in the scene or just, she just don't care. [officer 4] Who's responsible for you? [phone ringing] [officer 4] Your grandparents? What would they say? -[phone ringing] -Huh? That's fine. [officer 4 chuckling] [car approaching] [officer 4] Hey, are you the coach? -Yes, sir. -[officer 4] Let me talk to you here for a second. [indistinct chatter] A cop could talk to anybody any way they want to, but if I talk in my regular tone, I'm being smart. Now, when I go around like people, like situations like that, my voice like turns, like, white. Talking about people getting smart with police. This is about police killing innocent people [sighs] I'm just trying to calm down. Bigger concern. [sighs] When I tell you to shut your fucking mouth, this is why. [Chris] It's not even about being white or black. But it definitely doesn't, doesn't help feeling any kind of stereotype of getting smart with the police. Like, it's a self-preservation. Hey. Uh, um, thank you, thank you. Hey. Uh-uh, come here, come here. Like, you're getting smart right now. Like, just the way you're talking. -Are you taking this seriously? -Yes. -Okay. -I could've been sleeping in jail the other night, or juvenile detention centers. I understand that. Or had some misdemeanor, on your record. Yeah. Okay, at 16 years old. Are you taking it seriously? I can't tell if you're being smart. -I'm... -The way you sound makes it sound sarcastic. -I understand. -[Chris] Okay. All right. -It's Montgomery. -I understand, I understand. Do you know where we... We was in Montgomery. They love taking niggers to jail. They can't wait. [people shouting] He's gonna be having it on the head. Remember, he can move. [inaudible dialogue] [tense music] [whistle trills] [tense music] [tense music continues] [people cheering] Forget about it right now. Don't mention it. Forget about it. Hey, listen to me. Keep your head up. Don't even cry. [muffled dialogue] [loud thud] [somber music] [Jaquan] [Chris] Yes. That makes me so mad. -That makes me so mad. -You even think this is his first time something like this had happened to him before? [Chris] -[Jaquan] All right. -[Chris] [chuckles] Hello. How is she? It's possible. -Good? -[Jamario] Hm! Oh, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. [James] Are you going to practice or not? And today, I woke up, not even making a move. -[mumbling] -[Chris] Right. Right, Rowe. Yeah. You have mood swings. [Jamario] So, everybody has mood swings. Sure, but I think yours are in a range that it exceeds that of most people. I think that you would benefit if you would talk to a professional. Man, the people that walk around up in here are like, This nigga crazy. And give me some medication, and next thing you know, bam. I'm on to medication I can't get off of. That I'll be hooked to. And they ain't gonna wonder. [Chris] Well, there, nobody can make you take a medication, Rowe. [Jamario] I just know I ain't feeling going up there and make me see my girlfriend go crazy, 'cause I'm not crazy. [stutters] I just have mood swings. And also breakdowns, that's it. Jamario, I don't think a professional is gonna say, "You're crazy." Like, that's not what they do. Screw them. You're not... you're not everything. -You're not everybody. -[man 11] [chuckles] You think you're a love doctor. [Chris] You do not need to go all the way down... You just got to e-mail and you got over yourself. [overlapping dialogue] -[man 11] A lawyer. -[Jamario] [man 12] Ten bucks. We have to go there. [man 13] [laughing] [man 13] Poor guy. He's getting a nervous break. [indistinct chatter] I would like a nice, quiet day again today. No phone calls, please. Okay. [school bell ringing] Hey, Teague! -[Teague] Hey. -Yes, always. [woman 2] Yeah. [indistinct chatter] [birds chirping] ♪ Young nigga, I got old cash Spazzing on they ass ♪ ♪ I got Prada on my ho ass, got my last one mad ♪ ♪ Pop a nigga like a damn tag, Shopping on they ass ♪ ♪ I just bought a new old Jag, ♪ ♪ Yeah, it's so fast ♪ [Chris] Nope, you're not. -[Teagan] Oh, my god. -No. -Can you chill out? -No. Hey, Teague's just definitely be suspending.

Opens his door to this young man who says, "Hey, I'm just raising money for the Johnson Wrestling Team." -Oh, my god. -To go buy what we all know. Really? That's what he's doing, while you all learn in school. So, here's what I'm going to say, me and Coach Scrib, got to walk down this hallway, gonna take care of this problem. [overlapping dialogue] Y'all can't... Hold on. Y'all can't get him up. Just talk to him first before you... You can't just sit up here and beat his ass every time. [overlapping dialogue] Y'all trying to fight him, you see. Y'all might just go talk to him. That's literally theft, nigga, like, that's theft. Because you and somebody else took their property, basically sold it for some weed, but you can go to jail for thievery. And to put money for our team, we've been working our ass off What they-- what they know us about? [overlapping dialogue] Okay, members, clearly... Teague, come on. We listening. We wanna hear from you. -What should we do to you? -We wanna hear it. We might think of the same word. [Jamario] Beat your ass. What I went through with Jaquan, that shit taught me a lesson, didn't it teach you a lesson? -Like... -You gonna be like me, son. -You gonna be like him. -[indistinct chatter] You going to jail. Listen, bruh. I know what we're saying is going through one ear -and out the other. -It's so easy... Fuck that shit. -Teague, I love you. -Stop. I love you! [somber music] [Chris] This is phase three of the season. It's gonna be hard. Go above. Keep your hips low. Gotta crack down between his legs! Between his legs! [Chris] Squeeze and grip! Squeeze in the ribs. -[whistle trills] -[crowd screams] [Chris] I know you guys are burnt out. I know you're ready for the season to end. We gotta work hard for each other. It's got to be something bigger than us. [Chris] I wanna see Jamario Rowe! What is inside of you? What's inside of you, Jamario? [grunts] -[Chris] Right there! That's it! -[whistle trills] [people cheering] [whistle trills] -Let's go! Let's go! -Break, break, break!

Bro, what the actual fuck. -[whistle trilling] -[people cheering] [whistle trills] [people applauding] [whistle trilling] [people shouting] We made it this far, man! [Chris] We have a team full of kids who qualified for the state championships. You guys really have earned it. [Chris] You really are real state champion caliber team. You have to believe it. -[fire crackers crackling] -[yells] [lively music] -[fireworks whistle] -[explosion] [all cheering] [Chris] We have a week before State. Start thinking about that.

Jamario Rowe. State champion. Go hard. Do not show on your face that you're tired. We're not gonna give our opponent a mental boost that they think that they broke us. We don't break. [all] Eleven, ten, nine. [Chris] Start over. All right, if you're doing it wrong, we're gonna start over. [overlapping dialogue] Oh, start again, start again. Wait for Jamario. [indistinct chatter] Guys, stay on him. He's a senior, he's been through my system for three years. [Chris] He's fit to be a father. This man. He's about to raise a kid in this world. Oh, jeez, bro. Man. [thuds] [Chris] Jamario, you're not gonna disrespect me in front of all these other kids. [Chris] Why are you being disrespectful right now? I'm not being disrespectful... Just move, man. [Chris] Let's go. Let's go, come on. You're going the wrong way. Hey, Rowe! Rowe, my ass, yeah... -Rowe! -[Jamario] Don't touch me. Cut it out. -[Jamario mutters] -Rowe! Cut it out, right now. Right now. You need to-- -[Chris] Rowe. -[Jamario] Get off of me. -All I said... -Get off me. -Get off of me. -Rowe. All I said, Rowe... [panting] Listen. -You just need to apologize... -Get the fuck off of me. [mumbles] I'm gonna beat your ass... [Chris] Rowe. Don't fucking touch me. Get your stuff. [somber music] When the Scrib came, cussing at me... He came, it hit me wrong. He was basically making me use my ill will. I haven't had my dad in my life for 15 years, so why would I want one now. [Samara] Do you wanna go or not, bae? I told you last night, I was gonna get you. You don't have to go if you don't want to. That's not what you wanna do, just tell me. Well, you don't have to go if you don't want to, just gotta tell me you wanna do something -and you don't. -Got five minutes, buddy. [Jamario] We've been fucking arguing for three days straight. We was even arguing last night. I'm not gonna stay here and waste my time arguing with you, I'm not. I was trying to break up with you last night. [Samara wailing] [Lolitia] What's you crying for, sweetheart? That baby's more important than any man beside Jesus. You're a mama, dear. He even got up with nothing. -Quit crying. -We're breaking up! [Lolitia] Oh, my god. [Samara] I want Mario to go with me, I didn't do anything. [Samara sobbing] [Lolitia] All right. [Lolitia] One minute, Mario's good, one minute, Mario's somebody else. Hm... He can talk to anybody he want to talk to. But I ain't paying for it. And I ain't going to a lawyer and get it for free. [exhales sharply] [Chris] All right. So, it's gotta be a three-minute speech, so it's gonna be roughly two pages, 16 font, double-spaced. [groans softly] Damn it. [Chris] Jailen, come over here, we gotta crank up the speech. Yes, master. [Jailen] Hold up, so with the people who already did this whole thing, had they did the same thing we done? Like... You know, getting students to pitch the whole thing. [Chris] Huh? All right, so like, from what I've seen in the video, there's a teacher standing up there just pitching-- [Chris] Yeah, this is a new idea. -What are they gonna say? -How are they gonna say no to some industrial children like you? Fuck. [Jailen] The same way they said no to those like... I don't know. All the time. Well, I'm not dusty. All right, so, Jailen, you ready to start our speech? No. What? No. [birds chirping] [knocking on door] [Lolitia] Who is it? Hi. You got a jacket? [Jamario] Yes you do, you don't have a warm jacket. [Jamario] Eh, screw it. I don't need... I'm good, man. [Chris] What do you mean you're good? -There's, there's no... -It's straight. [Jamario] I got, I got a big winter jacket in, in my closet. -[Chris] So, you don't want it? -[Jamario] No, I'm good. [Chris] This has been to two of Obama's inaugurations. That's good. It's been to the top of Africa twice. [Jamario] I'm straight. It's Patagonia. [Jamario] It's straight. All right, I'm still giving it to you. [Jamario] I don't need it. All right, where's your other controller? So, what are you stressed about right now? You're gonna be a dad? I don't know who I am right now, I'm chilling right now, I don't know who the guy, the fuck I am right now. [Chris] So see, what put you in this mood, really? I don't know. Well, let's talk to your mom. I'll clear it up. [Jamario mumbling] [Chris] Lolitia, could you come in here and talk to your son with me? [Jamario] No. [Chris] Lolitia, he's upset. My one request of you ever, besides making sure that this man goes to college, graduates, all that. Can you please, please, please, come to the state championship this weekend? I need you to get a letter, so I can have a ticket to my um, job. [Chris] All right. Anything you want. There is a not a single kid that I've ever seen who is this close to winning a state title. If they say, no, can you still take sick days? I have to have it written in paper, I have to have it... [Chris] All right, will you remind me to write the letter tomorrow? Jamario? You'll remind me? -Yeah. -[Chris] Okay. You promise me you'll go? -'Cause if you, if... -[Lolitia] I just told ya, I gotta have a letter for my job or I won't have no job. I'll get Obama to write a letter. Shake my hand before I leave, please. Jamario, turn around and give me a real handshake. I'll see you tomorrow morning. [light music] [man 16] How you doing, sir? [laughter] -[indistinct chatter] -[horse sputters] Damn! Crazy! [indistinct chatter] [laughs] Wrestle. [chuckles] [Chris] For each one in this room, tomorrow will be the hardest tournament of the year. In order to be in the zone, you have to be able to focus your mind. So I want you to just do nothing. But focus on your hands. [Chris] Tomorrow, you're gonna be holding a gold medal from the state championships in those hands. You're gonna hold a college scholarship in these hands. You're gonna hold your children and your grandchildren in these hands. I want you to put your dream, whatever it is, in your hands. [all] Bring us the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference. -[thunder rolling] -[rain pattering] [Jamario] People already think people like me is a little greedy, and they don't think we want it like they do. 'Cause where we grew up, where we come from, where we go to school, they think that, they think we gonna drop out and just become some thugs in the streets. I would know this, wouldn't I? Me and the band, just like home. [light music] [commentator] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen! And welcome to 64th Annual State Wrestling Championship [crowd cheering] [lively music] [Jailen] [commentator] Let's wrestle! -[whistle trills] -[crowd cheering] [grunting] [groans] [inaudible dialogue] Take him down!

[Chris] Stay in game, Rowe! You're good! [whistle trills] -Rowe! Rowe! -Rowe! -Ten seconds! -Good job! Look at the clock. [whistle trills] Rowe, you gotta get up! Short side, Jamario! [whistle trills] [somber music] [somber music continues] [Chris] I know. Hey, we are so proud of you. Hey, we are so proud of you. [Jamario sobbing] [Chris] We know how much you've been through to be here. We know how much you've worked and fought. [somber music] [commentator] In fifth, Jaquan Rhodes, J.O. Johnson. [crowd cheering] [commentator] Third place, Jailen Young. J.O. Johnson. [light music] [Chris] I'm gonna be honest, with you all. With all the lows, like, all the lows that we've had this year, I've contributed to a lot of it. I would do this again in a heartbeat. How about you guys? Would you guys do it again? [chuckling, sobbing] [Chris] Bring it in. Group hug, group hug. Bring it in. Hands in, let's bring it down the last time. [all] ...to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, [all] Jags! [light music] [Samara] Yesterday, I woke up and I felt like I had to pee. And it was my water, but they've been giving me medicine to stop my contractions to try to slow everything down. She could be here from anytime tomorrow... to three to four weeks from now. So, it's just a waiting game. [Samara] Jamario wants to be here, and he's actually trying now. I know he does love me, and has love for me, but he's not in love with me anymore. [school bell rings] [indistinct chatter] You know how we talked about... how I had all my credits and I was good, and that, that I was gonna graduate I was trying to figure out what else is, they talking about, because they keep saying that I'm not gonna pass. And... Did you take your final exam with Mr. Marshal? -No. -[Cooper] No. I'm gonna walk with you, we're going to go around there and you're gonna take that test. While you're doing everything you need to do, I'm gonna check with everybody else. You can do this. One class at a time. Like, my mind is bad right now. I don't... I don't know where to focus right now. I had a lot going on. -[groans] -[Cooper] I know you do. [Jamario] I know. I mean, I don't want you to miss that. [Jamario] I know. -[Jamario] So... -But I also... don't want your baby to be born to a high school dropout. [Jamario] I know, I know. Fuck. [professor] You are coming down to the wire. [Jamario] Dang! Got it. [Jamario sighs] Good luck. [Jamario] Thank you. [keyboard clacking] Well... [Chris] It's gotta be three pages. You have 60 minutes. [sighs] [tense music] [Jamario groaning] [Jamario] This is so stressful, bro. [professor 2] Oh, perfect! [sniffles] [Chris] I really love these students. And they're... all four are amazing kids. And, I'm really scared that they're gonna have a rough-ass life. I made all the same choices they did. And I was given a lot of chances. I don't know how that's fair. [Teague's mother] Turn the TV off, we gotta go. [calm music] [Teague's mother] Just do good, okay? [Teague] I will. Hold up. Please? -[Teague] I will. -Do your best. I want you to come back better. [imitates whooshing sound] [light music] Are those my shades, bro? No. [Chris] Are you sure? [Jaquan] Play the CD. [Chris] You don't have shades like these. [Chris] Bro, these are... These are what? Yeah, they're exactly like the shades I have. I'm not saying you're stealing my shades, bro. I didn't say that, dude. Goddamn, just 'cause I'm white, doesn't mean you gotta accuse me of accusing you. [Chris chuckles] Huh? What? "Congratulations. You're being recognized just because of your outstanding grades, leadership potential, and your desire to contribute to the good of science and technology."
