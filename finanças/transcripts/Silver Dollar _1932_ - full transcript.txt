- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Let's gather around that square! Now, we all know that St. Charles has a bad reputation from coast to coast. And the first thing you know, people will stop coming here. Then what'll we all do? It's about time we had some law and order. In my opinion, we ought to change the name of this town and start a new deal. How about it, boys? All right. - Any ideas for a name? - Paradise. The Milky Way. Seeing as you are the only woman here, Poker Annie, what do you think? I like St. Charles. Oh, Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, I'd like to take the floor. You can have it, Yates, if Slick don't mind you leaving the bar. Well, I'm buying, Slick! I don't aim to be contradicting the lady, but when it comes to naming this town St. Charles, I like to say that there ain't no saints in St. Charles. We men of Kansas, and there are plenty of us here... We men of Kansas think mighty well of our governor. General James W. Denver. What do you say we name this town Denver? My friend Yates Martin proposes the name of Denver All in favor say so. Denver! Well, that's fine. We've got to draw up rules and regulations. And the first thing is to nominate a temporary mayor. I nominate Yates Martin as the first mayor of Denver, Colorado! Well, I hardly know what to say. But it looks like the drinks are on me. Well, boys, you're going to see things around these parts. You're going to see a city, cities all around here. You're going to see an empire that's going to make... ... those places back East look like villages. And that ain't no dream. Why, I've got 300 acres back in Kansas but it can rot for all I care. Yates Martin's after gold! And there's enough gold in these mountains to bury us all in gold caskets. And, uh... and, uh... Oh, heck, I'll buy you all another drink. That was certainly wonderful the way the boys treated me tonight. And I wanna tell you how that I appreciated it. And you can depend on me that I'm gonna give them the best that's in me. Well, are you coming to bed or do expect to stand there all night? Yes, it's me, your loving wife Sarah. This is your son Mark. You had a little too much, huh? Oh, no, no... Just a couple with the boys. You know, I sort of organized things for them tonight. You're going to see a big city here. Fact is, you ought to be very proud of me. I know, you were elected mayor. Hey... how did you know? Every time we stay any place more than two days you're elected mayor. Well, I can't help that. I'm just a natural-born leader. You certainly could leave that charge to the bar. Oh, now, Sarah, please. In the meantime, what's left between us and starvation? I told you we'd come to grief. - We ought never to have left Kansas. - But Sarah, we're going to be rich. Yeah, what have you done so far? You bought two worthless claims, salted mines. Spent practically all our money, wasted time. Thank God we've still got that $500 to get us back to Kansas. But we ain't got the five hundred. - What did you do with it? - Well, I, um... I was talking to some of the boys and... - They kind of liked me and so they... - And you bought another claim. That's right. Oh, Yates, what's going to become of us? Oh, now, don't you worry, Sarah. You stick to me and we'll be buried in gold caskets. You'll see now... In the meantime, with the grace of Providence, we're still among the living. Oh, Yates, you've been fooled again. No, nobody's fooling me. There's gold here alright. See that nose? That's not only for snoring. That's for smelling out the gold. There's enough of this yellow stuff in these mountains... ...to make gold teeth for all the crocodiles in India. - Howdy, Mrs. Martin! - Howdy, howdy, boys. How are you? We're moving over to Leadville, Yates. There's a new strike. - When are you leaving? - Right away. - Well, maybe we'll go with you. - Why, Yates, we just got started here. Joe Meisner took out over a thousand dollars in two days. - That's what he did. - You'd better come along, Yates. You'd better come along! Goodbye! Say, let's pack up and follow them, huh? We don't want to drift around all the time, do we, Yates? Well, I can't stay put, not until we strike it rich somewhere. Oh, maybe there isn't any gold up there. Yates, I've been thinking about something else. What's that? Well, haven't you noticed it isn't the men who dig the gold up here who are getting rich? It's the men who sell them things. - Saloon keepers, you mean. - No, no. Yates, if we're going over to Leadville, why don't we open up a little store? I didn't tell you, but I kept out $200 to get us back to Kansas and... ...you could have that to open a store. - Me, a storekeeper? - You'd do fine as a merchant. Merchant? - Yates Martin, merchant. - Hm-hmm. I... I kinda... Yes, you'll do fine in the mercantile business. Yes... why not? Abe Lincoln started by splitting rails, Yates Martin will start by cutting bacon. How about is, Mark, eh? Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief. Doctor, lawyer, merchant! Two sacks of beans. That makes, um... $48.75. - And twelve pounds of bacon. - Fifteen pounds of bacon, Yates! - Fifteen? - Aye! Is that right, boys, fifteen? If she said fifteen, it must be so. Fifteen pounds of bacon, that makes, um... Um... $64.50 you owe me, boys. But you say we don't have got to pay today for this bill... - ...but when we find the gold. - Sure, sure, that's right. Yates Martin trusts you. - And then we pay you everything. - That's right. Ja... then we'll be leavimg. Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do. Now, there's two of you and one of me. And that makes three of us. Now, you don't have to pay me anything. Just you give me one third of everything you find. How's that? That's very good, sir. ( in German ) - By me it's good. - That's fine! Alright then, you can sign this paper. For provisions given, we hereby... agree to give... Yates Martin one third... ...of everything we find. Sign it, Rische. Come on, Hook, you put your John Hancock down. There you are, the bill is paid. We win or lose together. That's fine, that's fine! Thank you very much! - Oh, he's a good man. - All right, boys. When you come in the store, you get anything you want now. The store is yours. Thank you very much. - Goodbye! - Auf wiedersehen. Keep on digging, boys, there's gold up there, I'm sure of it. Now what do you want to go fussing about three pounds of bacon for? Oh, it doesn't make any difference, I don't suppose we'll get paid for it anyway. Now why do you go on talking like that? Everybody's trading with me. You've got to trust people and take chances, that's business, ain't it? Why, as soon as they bring the money, we'll be rich. Yes, but nobody's coming back. You grubstake anyone who happens in. Never did see a country settled up with such greenhorns as Colorado. Nobody's staying, the town's going all down, can't you see that, Yates? Well, I can see plenty. There's gold here and I've seen that too. Wait till somebody makes a strike and they all start bringing it in. Then you'll see what I mean. It's like bread on the waters. Aye. I want more, Mom. Yes, dear, you can have some more beans. Your father's a big man, so his little son can have some more beans. We had beans yesterday, Mom. Yes, dear, and the day before. You won't have to be troubled with them much longer, though, they're almost gone. Your mama's little man can eat the nice bark off the trees. I don't want bark, I want bacon. So does your mom. We had some bacon last summer. But your father gave it all away to tramps who said they were looking for gold. Now we can't buy any more. That's the left boot, Yates! Why don't we eat what's in the store, Mom? Cause your father's a storekeeper with an empty store. He's got to be popular with the boys, dear. Well, everybody has their ups and downs. Our ups are coming. They're not coming, we're just getting poorer and poorer here. Cause you're just too stubborn to quit. Everybody else is going. Oh, let's go back to Kansas, we still own the farm. Farm? You show me the farm we can dig gold out of potatoes. Well, you're not digging gold out of anything. All I can see is a lot of worthless black rock and a book of bad debts. I came to these mountains to get rich, so as we can amount to something. I know you did, Yates, and you've tried hard, but... Well, you can't get rich where there isn't any money. Now look, we got all our old friends back East. And you were starting to get along fine in politics. Well, not that I ever approved. Now, wasn't it better there than here? Wasn't it? Yes, I suppose so. Yates, will you go back? Hm? I'm so glad! Well, since it's on your account we opened the store, I suppose I ought to help you get out of this hole. Mack! Did you hear that? We're going home! Oh, Mack, we're going home, we're going home, going home. We're going home, we're going home, we're going home. - Hi, Yates, - Hiya, boys! - Come on in. - Howdy, howdy! What's all the celebrating? - Oh, we're thinking of moving. - No! - You're not leaving us Yates? - Yes, we're going back to Kansas. What for, I thought you were doing pretty good here. Oh, yeah, we're doing fine, only, um... I've got some valuable property back East that needs looking after. That's too bad. We need you here in Lake County, Yates. Tell him why, Mike. Well, the boys got together yesterday in Granite City, and decided that the county's got big enough to have a treasurer. And everybody says Yates Martin's the man. Well! - Who said that? - Why, the whole crowd. Why, they allow that you're the only real businessman in the county. Popular with the boys, well, that's all there is to it. All you've got to do is say yes. Well, that's darn nice of the boys. Well, sure. Come in, come in, boys, sit down, have a bite. That's a good idea in this kind of weather. - Are we gonna move, Mom? - Doesn't look like it. Your father's too popular. Did you hear that, Sarah? Treasurer of Lake County. What do you think of your Pop now, huh? Do you mean to tell me we're gonna stay on in this hole... ...just so you can be treasurer of a county that hasn't got any money? But think of the honor. I'll be County Treasurer. The voters demanded, same as with, um... Abe Lincoln. You come inside and fix a bite for the boys. A bite of what? If there is anything in this house, you can get it for them. - Well, we gotta treat them... - Oh, yes, treat them, treat everybody. Oh, you're getting ahead, Yates. You started in giving away money, now you you've got up to giving away beans. Have yours in a second, Mike. Unless you're too proud to have a plate of beans with the County Treasurer. Guten tag, Fr?u Martin, is he here? I'm sorry, Mr. Martin's busy. He hasn't anything left anyway. You don't understand. This time we have not come to get something, but to show something, look! Yes, we've seen plenty of that black stuff. But you don't understand. - How are you, boys? - Oh, Mr. Yates! We've got news for you, look! Thousands and thousands of tons of this stuff we find. Well, shows you boys have been working. Keep it up, you'll find something yet. But do not go away. You know what that stuff is? What, is it worth anything? Worth anything? We have sent to Saint Louis to the smelter some pieces. - It's worth for the ton $800! - Ja, $800. Eight hundred dollars a ton? I knew it! - It was here all the time! - Ja! Millions and millions of tons everywhere! And we dig deeper down, it's more richer yet. And for you it's one third as agreed on the paper. I knew there was gold here! We're rich, Sarah! We're rich! Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold! Eight hundred dollars a ton! We found it right under our noses! It's gold! He don't understand. It's silver, lead combinates. - Then we're not rich. - Ja, we're all rich! Just like it was gold. Look, here is the paper from the smelter. He didn't understand it was silver. - Yates! - Come back in, come back in! Now maybe they'll listen to me! - Yates, listen! - Yates, it is silver! I knew there was gold here, what do you think of me now? - It isn't gold, it's silver! - It's silver! What do I care, it's the same thing, only spelled different. Gold! Gold! Mack, did you wash your face and hands? - Yeah. - Behind your ears too? Yeah. Do I gotta wear these outdoors? So it seems, dear. Your father wants you do be dressed like a mayor's son should. And a postmaster's son too, huh, Ma? - Yeah, I know. - And I'm a shrewd businessman's son. - Who said that? - Carl Warren. He said that's what Father is. What's a shrewd businessman? Well, sometimes it's a man who's had a lot of luck. And don't you tell Carl Warren I said so. - Hi, Yates. - Hi, Yates. I'd only been gone seven days, and when I come back to work the old mine, I found Chicken Phil squatted there. Said it was his, just because I had abandoned it two years ago. Well, what do you want me to do about it, Zeb? Why, you're the mayor, you can kick him out. - I guess I can, Zeb. - Yes. There it is, there ain't nothing like the ladies. Ain't they nimble, ain't they sweet? - Howdy, Miss! - Hiya, Yates! How's the claim? There's no other, running twelve hundred a ton. Keep it running, boys. We got fifty thousand out of the little Pittsburg mine last week. Used to call for something or other across the bar. Come along. What can I do for you, friend? Well, I don't want to interrupt nothing. - I'm selling, not buying. - What have you got to sell? I got this out of my claim up at Friar Hill. Right next to your Little Pittsburg. You know ore all right, what do you think of it? Hm... That looks as good as the Little Pittsburg. If I was you, I'd do some fancy digging. Well, that's just the trouble, I can't. I ain't well myself and my wife's sick back East. I'm busted. Gotta sell out. How much? Oh, um... fifty thousand. Of course it's worth a lot more than that, but... Well, I don't like to take advantage of a sick man, but if you are satisfied... - Yates! - Yes? He don't look like a busted miner to me. - What's the difference? - There's some trick in it. I know ore when I see it, don't I? Now Yates, you're not gonna buy a mine you don't know anything about! I know all about Friar Hill. I ain't never made any mistakes about mines yet, have I? That's alright, partner, glad to help you out. I always knew you was a square man, Mr. Martin. Now look here, I've got a little business here to clear up, I'll meet you at the bank in fifteen minutes. Thanks, Mr. Martin, I'll be waiting for you. - Hi there, Yates. - Hi there, Hammond. I'll be right with you, boys. I don't like to keep this little lady waiting here any longer. - Two pounds you said, Liddy? - Yes, sir, mister... Mister Mayor. Mr. Adams came down from Denver to see you. It's very important, Yates. So is this, ain't it, Liddy? - We ain't had our supper yet. - There, you see, boys? That's alright, Martin, go on, cut bacon if that's your ambition. All we wanted was to ask you to run for Lieutenant Governor? Thank you, goodbye. What do you say, Yates? - Lieutenant Governor? - Hm-hmm. - Of the State of Colorado? - That's what we're talking about. You see, this fellow Stanton figures to sort of run the state. We gotta have the strongest ticket we can get to lick his crowd. We need the Lake County vote. And the boys agreed there's only one man who can swing it. Yates Martin is the man. Well, Yates, you used to have a tongue. Sarah! Ma! - Sarah! - What's the matter? - Sarah, come down here! - Wait... what is it? I'm... I'm... I'm... - You tell her what you told me. - Howdy, ma'am. - We were just asking your husband... - Sarah, I'm Governor. Governor of Colorado. What did I tell you? Now will you stick by me? - Lieutenant Governor we mentioned, ma'am. - Well, it's got Governor in the title, ain't it? - But I don't understand. - We're just asking him to run, ma'am. The election ain't over yet. Don't you worry about that. The boys will take care of that. The boys know me. You go back to Denver and tell them that Yates Martin will stick to them to the finish. I tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to organize a fire company here. New uniforms, hose car from Chicago and all that. All at my own expense. Guess that will bring out every vote in Lake County, huh? - Looks fine! - And furthermore, - I've just bought a new mine. - You're not buying that mine! It's a better-paying mine than Little Pittsburg. And if I'm elected, I'm going to give half the profits to the state of Colorado. - To the people of the state of Colorado. - To the people, that's right. Don't you ever worry about me being elected. If you want Lake County, you've come to the right man. Well, boys, refresh yourselves, and then we'll dedicate the mine. - Hooray for Yates! - See you tonight, thank you, thank you. That parade worked fine, Yates. Ought to get us a lot of votes, don't you think? Absolutely. And now about that little speech for the voters. Oh, yes, about my donating one half of what I get out of this mine... ...for the good of the State of Colorado. For the people of the State of Colorado, Yates. - Don't forget that word "people". - That's right, I mustn't forget that. For the good people of the State of Colorado. - Mr. Martin. - Well, George, hurry up now, I gotta make a speech. - You've been skinned, Mr. Martin. - Skinned? There ain't no mine here. Why, it's a sell. What are you talking about, George? Look at the ore all around here. Good ore too, it can't fool me. Sure it's good ore, come from the Little Pittsburg. Little Pittsburg? Salted mine, you mean? Someone must have dumped in a couple of wagonloads of rock from your own mine. We've been down thirty feet and there ain't a sign there being. Bought it from a sick man you say, hm? Well, I guess he ain't sick no more. Yates, come on, they're waiting. Here, don't let this get out, George. People might think I'm a fool and might not vote for me. How am I going to explain why we quit digging? Don't quit digging, put out some more men, I'll pay for it. Keep digging until after election anyway. Come, come, Yates, can't keep the folks waiting. And what I want to say, friends, in opening this mine, I'm going to dedicate it to the public. I want my friends who stand here today... to remember that if elected Lieutenant Governor, I will devote one half of all this mine produces... ...for the good of the State, for the good of the people of the State of Colorado. I have been criticized a lot... ...for my optimistic attitude on everything. When I said... ...there will be cities here rivaling the capitals of Europe in wealth, there were people who laughed at me. But the things I said have been borne out. And now I say to you... that the soil on which we stand on... will produce riches... ...greater than all the wealth that the world has ever known. And it is my hope and belief... that it will also produce men as rich in character and mind... ...as it is in shining silver! Mrs. Martin, I think you're the luckiest woman in Colorado. And I think so too. My husband said there's no way of telling how far Yates Martin will go. Everything he touches seems to prosper. Oh, yes, Mr. M is very fortunate, there's no denying it. - And he's so good to you. - Oh, yes, he's very good, yes, yes... Perhaps some day he may be Governor. Wouldn't it be grand to be the first lady of Colorado? Aye You don't seem very excited about it, Mrs. Martin. Well, maybe I'm not the excitable kind, Mrs. Hamlin. - I'm sure... - I've tried to do my duty by my husband. Of course at times it wasn't always the way they are now. But what's coming, nobody knows. Whatever it is, I expect to keep on trying. It's a beauty, Yates. I don't think I ever saw one like it before. Best in the State. This lumber comes special from South America. Now there's a lovely thing. You won't see another like it. Whittled out of one piece of wood. Yes sir, we've rented this whole floor. The hotel gives a special service. I had a private telegraph wire run in from Denver. Bought at my own expense. Got an operator right across the hall. So we'll be the first to hear the election returns. This furniture made special in Chicago. Cost a lot, but I guess we can afford it. Got to live up to our position, don't we? Now there's a lovely thing. - Here's something interesting, Yates. - Solid silver. Out of the Little Pittsburg. I put it in the window for everybody to look at... ...because it sort of represents Leadville. It represents Yates Martin too. Made of silver, you know. You know, I'm going to give this to the State if I'm elected. I'm going to put it in the Capitol, when we build a Capitol. Of course we'll have a Capitol, Martin. Good thing for you to start on as Lieutenant Governor. Well, I've been thinking about it. Hear that, Sarah? Well... Now, gentlemen, I ask you to look at my wife. I got a dress like she deserves. Sent all the way to Paris, got six dresses of the best silk. Yates, Yates, please. But Sarah, I can buy all the silkworms in Japan. Why shouldn't my wife wear silk, lots of silk? Yates, speaking of being elected, we ought to be hearing something. Well, easy to find out. Come with me, boys, I want you to see my private telegraph. It looks like it's all over for the shouting, Yates. To wrap the whole County was indeed no surprise. Well, it's not altogether unexpected. Wait till you hear from Denver. Mr. Martin, you're elected! Yates Martin is elected This is a great day for me. And I hope that during my period in office... ...there will be greater days for the people of the State of Colorado. Anyway, I want to thank you all. And when you come to Denver, don't forget to look me up. I may be Lieutenant Governor of the whole State, but I ain't forgetting old Leadville. That was your ace high, Martin! - Hey, congratulations, Governor. - Thank you. I didn't want to interrupt the party, but I thought you'd like to hear the good news. Oh, yes! Well, you don't have to dig any more. Oh, yes we do. We kept on just as you said. Struck a vein fifty feet down. Smelter folks say it's the richest rock they've had yet. - What's that? - Yes, the new mine. Struck ore that runs eighteen hundred to the ton. Good as all that, eh? Hm, it's better than I expected. Better than you expected? Say, boss... Come on, Yates, let's tell them that. One moment, please. It may interest you as friends of our Lieutenant Governor, to hear that his shrewdness and foresight have again been vindicated. We have just heard that the claim he purchased... to help out an unfortunate prospector... ...has turned out to be the richest mine in the whole Leadville district. I'm holding to my promise. Half of all I get goes to the great State of Colorado. To the people of the great State of Colorado. Well, I guess I told them something to cheer them up! Hello, Joe! How are you? There's Joe. Great news about my Papa, ain't it? - Good morning, Governor. - Howdy. Governor, can we take a minute of your time? I can't see you now, I've got to preside at the Senate session, you know. Very well, Governor, very well. - Hello, Yates! - Hello, Zeb, how've you been? - Great. - How's the old claim? - Fine, getting lots of ore. - Keep on digging, old boy. You bet. Glad to see you. How are you doing this morning? - Good morning, Governor. - Good morning, Governor. I got a price on that new house on Lincoln Street that you wanted. - Oh, yes, how much? - Forty thousand. - Well, buy it, I'm going to live there. - Very well, sir. Howdy, boys! Order! Order! And as Lieutenant Governor, I have the privilege of ordering first. But Governor, we've already ordered. Well, that ain't fair. - All paid for, Pete? - Not yet. The boys remembered your privilege. Now, that's more like it. I'll pay the bill. Oh, and see here, now. From now on, I want to see these boys served proper. Silver goblets for the champagne. And silver Tom and Jerry cups. Everything, I'll pay for it. Oh, and here's another thing. We're going to have some real cooking here. I've sent to that place in New York, um... Delmonico's, for a real chef! We're going to have nothing but the best. Ah, nothing is too good for Colorado. Mr. Secretary, have you got the champagne corks? - Yes, sir. - Now let's see if there's a quorum. Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen... yep, there's a quorum! Now we can do business. Gentlemen, the Senate of Colorado is now in session. And the first question is unfinished business. Peter, fill 'em all up again. - Are these the records, Mr. Secretary? - Yes, sir. Thank you. Beer? I'm ashamed of you boys. That ain't like the Senate, it's more like the House of Representatives. Peter, you take this out to the kitchen and have it dried so we can pass it. A senate may be wet, but it ain't that wet. Read them off, Mr. Secretary. A bill to appropriate funds for the building of a State Capitol Building in Denver. What's the matter with this place? Oh, we ought to have some sort of building that belongs to the State. Something big and artistic. I'm for it. Well, is that a motion? You know we got to do these things with motions, you know? All right, I motion it. Got anything to say, anybody? Anybody against it? Well then, that's passed. Mark it, Frank. And now, boys... Oh, and by the way, how much was that appropriation for? - Two million dollars. - Does that include the bar, Governor? Oh, don't you worry about that. I'll take care of the bar. I'll give them one with a silver footrail. Oh, yes, and that ain't all. You know... you know, I've been thinking that what this city needs is more culture. You know, opera, theater, and things like that. And so I am going to give to the people of the City of Denver... ...the finest Opera House that silver can buy. I'm going to send to Italy for marble, to Central America for mahogany, to London for copper, to Chicago, New York for architects, and I'm going to bring the biggest artists in the world here. Even if it costs me a million dollars. All for the pleasure of the people of the State of Colorado. Gentlemen! I offer a toast to Yates Martin's Opera House. There still seems a lot to be done. Don't worry about that, Mr. Martin, everything will be ready on time. Well, how about the cornerstone? Do you want your name carved on it? Why not? Even an Opera House ought to know it's own father, don't you think? Very well. Now, there are a few things in the lobby I want to talk to you about. Well, we'll have a look at this and then we'll decide what will have to be done. Now, I'd like to suggest that we put Goethe here. He wrote Faust, you know. And it might be appropriate to have some of the others put up. Like Schiller, Moli?re, Sheridan, and, if you prefer, we can have a bust of that celebrated composer Beethoven. How does it sound to you, Governor? Sounds terrible. Who are all these fellows anyway? They're immortals of the theater, and I thought... Like Schiller, Moli?re, Sheridan, and, if you prefer, we can have a bust of that celebrated composer Beethoven. How does it sound to you, Governor? Sounds terrible. Who are all these fellows anyway? They're immortals of the theater and I thought perhaps that, um... Never heard of them. And I know a thing, there ain't anybody around here who's interested... ...in a bunch of foreign names. Now look here, if you're going to put up some busts, why, put up my friend Hamlin, and Pistol Pete and General Grant... ...and Abe Lincoln. Oh, yes, and Poker Annie. Have her with a cigar. Well, what do you think, miss? Did you know who all these foreigners were? Well, not all of them. But I think any lady that smokes a cigar deserves a statue. Why, certainly. Besides, Poker Annie means something to Denver. Oh, does she? I've never heard of her. No? Hm, then you must be a stranger here. I've only been here a week. You are the only one I ever heard of back East. Mr. Martin, will you look at this inscription? Tell that man working on the inscription... ...that I want it done in plain American like I told him. Nobody in Denver reads Latin. I told him, Governor, but he insists it should be done in Latin. What? Then I'll have to do it myself. You know you have to do things yourself if you want them done right. - Want to watch me? - Oh, I'd love to. Young man, wipe off the foreign lettering, I'm coming up and doing it myself. Now this is certainly a happy surprise your coming here. All good things seem to be coming to Denver. Oh, thank you, Mr. Governor. A man certainly has his hands full attending to all these matters. Oh, you must be an awfully busy man. Running the Senate and taking care of everything yourself. Oh, I find time for everything. Everything? Well... Now, Mark! That peppermint candy's going to ruin your outdoor appetite. Where did you get it? Papa bought it for me. And he told me to tell you he's sorry, but he won't be home for supper. He's going to be busy again. Oh. Well, you run upstairs and wash your hands and face and... ...we'll have supper together. - Mary, assist Mrs. Martin. - No, never mind, I... Well, thank you. With your permission, Madam, where do you wish it placed, Madam? Well, I didn't wish to have it placed, I wished to place it. My dear sir, for seven years I made out all the returns for the Post Office. And General Adams said that during those seven years... ...he only had to send back one paper for correction. So I expect I'll know where I want to have a picture placed in my own house. Yes, Madam. Wonder where he'd like it. You like it better here, Lily? Yes, that does show it off much better, thank you. - Hm. - Fine. You know how to do everything, don't you, Mr. Martin? - Ah-ah-ah! - I mean, Yates. Well, that's better, Lily. I just can't get used to calling you Yates. - It seems so familiar. - Oh! Think of it, the Governor of Colorado helping me move. - Lieutenant Governor. - Oh, that's what I meant. You've been so wonderful to me. I just can't believe it. Well, I love to do things for you, Lily. You enjoy it so. How do you like that frame? - Solid silver. - Is it really? Hm... wait till you see the opening of my Opera House. Everybody who's anybody's going to be there. But more than that! General Grant, that's who. - He's going to be my guest. - My, but won't you be proud? Will I? Me and General Grant. Say, did you stop to realize that General Grant knew Abraham Lincoln personally? Why, he'll be there sitting and talking to me just like I'm talking to you. I suppose you'll forget all about poor little unimportant me. Why, of course not. You'll be there. Yates! Are you taking me? Well, no, not exactly, but, um... I've got a box set aside for you right across from mine. I'm always right across from you. Would you like to be closer, hm? Wouldn't you? Well, we do seem to be getting along pretty good together. You do like me a little bit, don't you? Of course I do. My but you smell nice. Here he comes, here he is! Here we are, gentlemen, my private box. General, Captain... This is where you sit, Mark. General, I... I certainly appreciate your coming here tonight. You've done Denver a great honor. I know you've been around the world, but you're going to see something tonight that you've never seen before. Pretty good seats. hm? You can see and hear everything from here. Lieutenant Governor, the performance is about to begin. Well, let it begin, that's what I'm paying for. Where's the champagne? Bring some champagne for the general. And some cigars. Now don't tell me you don't smoke cigars, General, I know better, I've seen your pictures. You know? Where's your mom, Mark? She couldn't come, she had a terrible headache. Said you'd understand. You know, folks here know me. Here's what the Citizens' Association just gave me. Got my whole history there in gold, silver and diamond. Now that's an ore bucket, there's a spade, a shovel, a pick, and that's a mule. Shows what this opera house was built on. It ain't only the opera house either, you know. I've built them an office building here, the Martin Block. It's the first building in Denver that's higher than two stories. And I built them a hotel in Leadville, you probably saw it coming through. But wait, I'm going to make a speech later. You'll be interested too. I'm going to give the government something. Good for you, son, come right in, come right in. Fill a glass for the general. Ladies and gentlemen, I take great pleasure in introducing... Oh, he needs no introduction. Lieutenant Governor Yates Martin. Ladies and gentlemen. I've seen Denver grow from a mining camp... ...into a city of thirty or forty thousand people. And I said that if Denver is to have an opera house, it ought to have one worthy of this city. I ask you to look around this opera house... ...and see whether I've done my duty in this respect. But I'm going to do something more. I bought this whole block... and one half of it I hereby give to the United States Government... ...to be used as a site for the finest Post Office in the United States. Oh, I was so proud of you. You were wonderful! - It was a wonderful show. - Modest. Just think of General Grant coming way out here just to open an Opera House. My Lily, the eyes of the country were on Denver tonight. The eyes of the country were on you, Yates Martin. You spoil me, Lily. Nonsense, you just don't know what it is to be appreciated, that's all. Well, now that I'm beginning to find out, it... ...seems kind of good. It's like rich wine when all you've been used to is... ...cold water from a mountain spring. Oh, Lily... Weren't you a mite, um... ...well, disappointed in the General tonight? I mean, he seemed just like ordinary folks, just like you and me. You're not ordinary, Yates, and I won't let you say it. Yeah, I bet when Grant ran that tanyard in St. Louis, he never figured that some day he'd lead armies in the Great War, save the country, become President. And no one knows your destiny either. There's something, well... great that seems to cling to you. - Just like Grant. - Oh, Lily... Oh, yes there is. I felt it as I watched you two together tonight. Not like other men. The mark of kings upon you. - Now, honey. - Some day... the biggest thing in my life will be... ...that I once knew Yates Martin. Well, Lily, how you talk. - You know I'll never leave you. - Oh... - You hardly looked at me tonight. - Of course I did! Didn't I have your box put right across from mine so as I could? Oh, I don't mean like that. Oh, Yates, my darling, you're so big and strong. I... I want you to be all mine. Well, I'm... I'm arranging things. We'll work this out. You know, I... I gotta be careful. But why, you're the biggest man in Colorado. Nobody can hurt you now. Oh, yeah, I know that. But you see, I'm, um... I'm thinking of running for United States senator. - And any kind of a scandal might... - But there won't be any scandal. Your wife won't make any trouble... If... if you make her comfortable enough. Oh, no... no, Sarah ain't like that. If it were, it would be easy. I, uh... I just don't know what to say to her. But Yates, I love you so. - May I help you, sir? - Why, no, sir. I mean... go to bed. Good night, sir. Yates, is that you? What's the matter? Nothing. - Are you going on a trip? - I'm going to the Windsor Hotel. Windsor Hotel? But you're taking your things. I'm going to live there. What for? What's the matter with this place? Why, there's nine rooms here you've never been in yet. Are you... Look here, are you sick? Oh, now... poor Papa, you... You've been overworking yourself. Well... Well, you just keep away from the office for a while and stay home for a few days, hm? Just you and me. I'll take care of you like I used to. Now, now, now, there's no need for you to work so hard. We've got everything we want, more than we want. So we can just sit down and rest awhile. We're neither of us as young as we were. No... no. I ain't gonna live here anymore. I ain't gonna live with you anymore. You can get a divorce, you can have this house, it's yours. You can get all the money you want, I'll fix it up. All you need. But I ain't living here anymore. I ain't living here anymore. Yates! Yates, listen! Yates! No, Yates... Don't leave me! - Why, that's unbelievable. - I'm afraid you can't do it, Yates. You mean to tell me that the people of this State, the people of Colorado, that I've done so much for won't elect me for the Senate? Why, that's... We all know you've been a good friend of the people. Friend? What about the Opera House? What about my donating the site for the Post Office? What about my... I know, I know, but... May I speak frankly? Yes. Now, the boys like you, but they're afraid to run you for Senator. - Afraid? - It's the women, Yates. - Women? What do you mean women? - Women make public opinion... ...in some things, Yates. Strong sentiment has formed against you in the last few weeks. - Since the opening of the Opera House, huh? - Yes. You mean my wife not being there. - And her. - yes. Why, that's stupid. What have my private affairs got to do whether I'm the man for the Senate or not? - You couldn't budge the legislature. - Legislature? Why, I can buy the whole legislature if necessary and make them brush off my chair. Well, maybe you could and maybe you couldn't. But if you try it, you'll wreck the Party in this State. You'll start a storm that may sweep you out of public life entirely. If you could only go back to your wife until after... No, that's out of the question. I won't use my wife for a cloak. Why, I... I was counting on getting married in Washington. Yes, and having the President at my wedding. Why, she sort of banked on it. Well, I'm sorry, Yates, but that's the way it stands. Say, now look here. You say I can't be elected to the Senate. - That's for the long term. - Yes. But how about Teller when he's appointed Secretary of the Interior? Who fills his place? For the short term, I mean. Oh, the governor will appoint someone. Chilcott's been promised it. It's only for thirty days. Well, thirty days or thirty years, it'll make me Senator, won't it? It'll get me to Washington, won't it? Well, I'll buy Chilcott off. Ah, yes! Senator Martin! Senator Yates Martin of Colorado. The gentleman from Colorado has the floor. How much will it cost? The President of the United States. Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the face of this company... ...to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. Friends,, I propose a toast to the bride! To the bride! And now, may I propose another toast? To the loveliest bride of this year... ...or any year. There now, that makes it official, that's the President talking. That was real sweet of you, Mr. President. And now we must have a toast to you. Oh, please, no. Instead, grant me the favor of a rose from the bridal bouquet. - Certainly. - Oh, give him a dozen, Lily. No, no, only one. Just one to take home with me to treasure as a memento of the occasion. Oh, now, that's fine, huh? Just think of it, Lily, one your wedding roses in the White House. - Isn't that marvelous? - Yes. Hamlin, I'm just the happiest man in the world. Mrs. Martin, I wish you all the happiness in the world. Oh, thank you so much. - Goodbye. - Oh, um... Your privilege, Mr. President. Oh... And again, I congratulate you most heartily, Senator. Thank you. Oh, Mr. President, What do you say we have a little drink on the side, just you and me? I'm sorry... I'll bet nobody in Denver ever saw anything like this before. Cost me over $400 apiece. Look at those letters. Solid gold. How many did you send out, honey? Fifty. Only to the biggest people. Guess society folks will know who's who around town now. Yates, why don't they ever come to see us? Oh, they'll be coming around soon. I'll show them who Mrs. Senator Yates Martin is. You know that forest of mahogany I bought down in that place down South, um... - Honduras. - Honduras, yeah, something like that. Well, you know, I'm buying some boats to ship the logs up here... ...and I'm going to build a house that's gonna make this one look like a shack. Every stick of it solid mahogany. Guess society folks will be coming around then. It'll make the whole United States get up and take notice. Why, darling, that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, won't it? Oh, maybe millions, what do we care? I've got more millions coming in all the time, got to invest it. Say, I've got more irons in the fire than any man in Colorado. I just bought a newspaper, and part of a railroad. And as soon as they build it, I'm going to be on the Board of Directors. And, um... I'm dickering for some gold lands in this place, um... where they chewing gum comes from... - Yucatan? - Yucatan, yeah, that's it. That will make us the richest people on earth. As soon as we get in the house, I want to show you... ...what one the men on my papers wrote about me. He said I was like the king who touched things and they turned to gold. - What's his name... - King Midas. Yeah, King Midas, that's it. Only the things that I touch turn to silver. He's right, honey. Congressman Bryan calling. - Bryan? - Yes. Oh, yes, wants to talk to me about silver. Oh, um... come in, Congressman! - Senator Martin. - Glad to see you, Congressman. Sit down. You're interested in silver, you say. - Immensely. - Then you've come to the right place. See what silver has done for me. For Denver. My chief interest now is in the future supply. Future supply? Young man, there's enough silver in those mountains around Leadville... to build a solid silver wall forty-feet high... ...right across the eastern boundary of Colorado. That's exactly what the gold men of the East seem to think. They believe there's too much. Too much? Now that's rich. How can there be too much of a good thing like silver? There's going to be a big fight, Senator, during the next few years. A sharp battle between the gold standard men of the East... ...and the silver men off the West. And one or the other will go down. Well, then let the gold men go down. We are building our empire on silver. They can't scare me. I'm not trying to scare you, Senator. I merely want to find out the facts of probable supply. And also to warn you that they'll do whatever they can... ...to demonitize silver. - What's that? - Reduce it's value. - Make it worth half as much... - Oh, then we'll dig twice as much. That's simple. We know what to do with silver. You know, I've always told these boys around here, you stick by me and you'll be buried in a solid silver casket. Well, now that's settled, we'll have a little drink. - What's yours? - Grapejuice. Hm? Briggs, Kristalite's down to one and a half. Owens, can't he just close his doors? What? Senator. Look at this. Silvertone to 48c. Well, what do we care? We'll dig twice as fast. But it costs more than that to mine it. They want 250,000 more margin at once. - Well, draw on the Leadville bank. - But the Leadville Bank closed... ...its doors this morning. - Fort McGuire, sir. - Sell that block of Majestic stock. But Majestic's down to three and a quarter. Senator, Senator, read this! Will you retire now, Madam? No. - Oh, um... Wilson. - Yes, Madam. You're quite sure Mr. Martin sent no message. Quite sure, Madam. Yates! Yates. Yates, what's the matter? Tell me, darling. Tell me what's happened. Get me... get me a drink of water. My poor darling. Are you sick, Yates? Yates, what's wrong? I don't understand it. I don't see how it could happen. They took everything away from me. Everything except the Matchless Mine. My own bank, buster. Wouldn't let me have a cent. There must be some mistake. I had twelve million dollars. Maybe more. Now everybody says I owe them. Wouldn't wait. Want to sell everything I've got left. Will they sell our home? Yeah... Don't worry, honey. Don't worry. - Mr. Martin. - Yeah? The new people are here with some things they want to move in. What are they trying to do? Throw me out? - Where are they? - In the outer office. Well, tell them to keep their things out there. They can have this office tomorrow when I'm through with it. Yes, sir. I took care of them, Mr. Martin. Is there anything else you want me to do this afternoon? You can... you can look for another job. Because I ain't got any more business to manage. I know, sir. It's hard to understand how it happened. They sold out everything that I had without asking me the price. That's what I can't understand. - It's funny. - Yes, sir. Well, I... I gotta be going now. Tell them they can come in any time they want to. Yates. Why, Sarah. How do you do? Been a long time, hasn't it? What, um... I mean, what can I do for you? Well, I heard about what happened to you and I... ...thought maybe I could help. I know you've been having troubles. Well, you gave me a lot of money and... I've invested it and... oh, there's a lot more now. And I thought... Maybe I could... Well, that's mighty nice of you, Sarah, but... I don't need no help. I lost a little money in silver, but... I ain't broke, no sir! Silver's coming back, and I've still got the Matchless Mine and, um... ...a lot of other things. And I've always taken care of myself, haven't I? - Yes. - Well, I can now too. Well, I hope you'll be very happy. Thank you. Oh, um... how is Mark? Mark's going to be married. Goodbye. Good luck. - Hello, Lily girl. - Hello, dear. Any news? Oh, nothing special. I was down at the exchange. Silver's still at 47. But it'll come back. Some day the Matchless Mine will be a mint again. You'll see. Some day the nations of the world will make silver the equal of gold. Why, England alone may lead the way back. And even America may some day recognize the rights of silver. Remember what I've always told you, Lily girl. You stick by me and we'll be buried in solid silver caskets. You'll stick by me, won't you, Lily? Of course I'll stick, honey. - Darling. - Yeah? The landlord was here again today. The rent's two months behind. And he says if he doesn't get it by tomorrow, We've got to move. How much is it? Sixty dollars. I'll see him. Now it's just one and one half ounces. You'll get $31.50. Is that the best you can do? You ought to know the market price of gold, Mr. Martin. It's $21 an ounce. - Alright. - Alright. Ten, twenty, thirty... and... Fifty. Paging Mr. Henry. Hello, Augustine. Oh, um... Could I see you alone for a minute, Senator? No, what do you want? Well, I was going to ask you if you could lend me a hundred. - Just for a few... - No. Senator Martin! Great heavens, Senator, I didn't know it was you. How are you, Senator, how are you? Well, I... I asked to see you just for a minute. Yes, yes, but I didn't know who it was. I'm terribly sorry. - Now come on and sit down. - Thank you. You asked me for a hundred. Well, it would be a great help. Well, I'll do better than that. There's five. Well, that's real kind of you. You know, I'm in a rather tight spot just now... only temporarily, of course. That happens to all of us. Glad to have been of service to you. By the way, Senator, how would you like a job? I'd like it real well. I've been on the lookout for one. I'm something of a mining man, you know. Yes. How would you like to be Postmaster of Denver? Postmaster? You know, that's in my line too. I used to be Postmaster up in Leadville. Then it's as good as done. I'll wire President McKinley tonight. Do you think he'll appoint me? You might tell him that... You're as good as appointed right now. Well... - I don't know how to thank you. - Oh, don't thank me. Denver's lucky to have a man like you. I'll go and tell the wife now. It'll be like getting back home again. You know, I gave the government that ground the Post Office is built on. Yes... I know. Thank you. No, nothing for any Martin. No letter from Washington? I said nothing from no place, and that goes for Washington, and Omaha and Honolulu. Young man, you're going to be a mite politer to the citizens next month. That is, if you're here. Ladies and gentlemen, I've seen Denver grow from a mining camp... ...to a city of thirty or forty thousand people. And I say that if Denver is to have an Opera House, It ought to have one worthy of this city. And I'm going to do something more. I bought this whole block. And one half of it I hereby give to the United States Government... ...to be used as the site for the finest Post Office in the United... Wait... wait... I can't go on. They're trying to choke me. What's the matter? Lily... Lily girl, where are you? Why, it's Yates Martin. The President has just appointed him Postmaster of Denver. I hope it's not too late. Don't forget, Lily. Hold on to the Matchless. Remember, stick by me... ...and you'll be buried in a silver casket. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
