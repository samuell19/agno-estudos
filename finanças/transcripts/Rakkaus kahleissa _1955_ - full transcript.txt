LOVE IN CHAINS Come to my place. Liisa has a night shift today. I'll come for a little while. Don't go now. - Would you like some coffee? - Sure. - Where's the socket? - It's in the lamp. Everything is all set. The old man ticks like a clock. Nothing can go wrong. But if one of us gets caught, button up. Now go home, so that I can get some sleep. We'll see here at 00:45 tomorrow, is that clear? Sure. Hide the drill. It's working all right. - So long. - So long. Get up, it's 6:30 already. Morning, mother. How are things? Today's a day like any other. - Are your hips still aching? - As always, but it doesn't matter. You should go see a doctor before it's too late. What can they say, and where will we get the money? We'll get it somewhere. - Morning. - Good morning. What's new in the papers? Did our boys win? - You kidding? They lost again, 3 - 0. - Let me see. Come get some coffee, boys. LOCK & MACHINE LTD. Get going, Martti! - Are you going out tonight? - Maybe dancing with Milja. Is she suitable for you, such a vamp? She has her own room. It's nice to sleep there. If only I had enough money to get married. That's what Verna is waiting for. To find a place with her. But with salaries like these... Did Pertti try to put his head through this sock? Oh, Verna dear... That boy wears his socks out. Hey there! - Would mother also like a swirl? - Don't be silly. I just dropped by to have a chat with her. - You'll come tonight, won't you? - I will, but I wish you'd stay. - Not now. Bye bye. - Bye. Oh, it's you. They're waiting for you at home. - No, they're not. - You should spend more time there. And drink less, yeah yeah. That's what I've been hearing for 30 years now. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. Good afternoon, well... the whole family. - Look, I have flowers too. - Come and eat something. - Some flowers for you. - The hell with your flowers! I like flowers. Go get a bite, dear. I will, mother dear. Since mother likes flowers, she likes them, and that's that. Pertti, you shouldn't speak that way to your old man. That's just the way it is. That's what I'd like to do some day, old man or not! Oh well, that wouldn't cure anything. I've seen the world a bit. I'm a sea captain, you know. What the captain says is the law, and that's that. To Milja from Taisto. Who is Taisto? Don't ask silly questions. Where will you take me tonight? You never take me to any fancy places. Call the waiter and order something. I was thinking of something cheap. My money's running out. You still have your watch. Pawn it. You can get it when you want. I know the guy, it can be done. Have you been here with Taisto? - What's that got to do with this? - I just asked. Don't start making a scene. Head waiter! I'm not going to spend all night with just a cup of coffee. You can do without your watch. Waiter! Waiter! - What would you like? - Everything you've got. - With all the trimmings. - A dinner with drinks, then. - And with coffee? - Brandy, of course. This guy left his wallet home. On top of the grand piano. But he has a watch. You can pawn it until tomorrow. There's no risk. Give him your watch. We'll take it back tomorrow. I arranged that pretty well, didn't I? You can have the next dance. Who could lead the way to happiness when it's always somewhere far away? An illusion that someone created but that I've never encountered myself. You won't find happiness by a shortcut, no one's yet come across such a way. It evades you, you hear only its laughter. You're alone now and forever you'll stay. It evades you, you hear only its laughter. You're alone now and forever you'll stay. Why can't we get married? I don't want any luxury. It's enough for me that we can be alone. I've thought of that too, but... I don't know. What are you worried about? Is it the money? Yes. When I look at mother and her work, I can't help... - ...but make comparisons. - What do you mean? I don't want you to end up the same way, to have to suffer. I've never thought it would happen. We both have a job. We could save a bit of money, if we really tried. - I guess so, but... - And we have to save something. So that we'll have savings if the little one comes along. The little one. Yes... The one who should become everything that father never did. And that's the way it will be. We'll make sure of that. Now we have only this day. And I have no way out. My parents couldn't get by without my help. It costs me a lot, but I can't help it. It's my duty. And helping you would be as well. Now's the time. - The walls have ears. - The heck they do. What's keeping Martti? He wouldn't chicken out? Nah, I know him well enough. - What's your hurry? - I told you, I'm going home. My mother is bed-stricken. I can't disturb her by coming late. - Mommy's boy wants to go home. - Knock it off. I'll come tomorrow. Hello, Taisto. Would you come up? He's gone already. That's good. I'll throw the keys to you from the window. Bye. Where the heck have you been? Let's get going. I need to change my blouse. Everyone knows what to do. Jalle will guard down here and Bosse up there. Martti and I will take care of the money. If we get caught, everyone gets up and gets going. Is that clear? Clear. Bosse! Guard the window! - Someone's coming! - Let's get out of here! Quick! MILLIONS ARE WAITING... A SHORTCUT TO HAPPINESS Just as I nearly had the money in my hands. - I should've just grabbed them. - That's right. Quit with that nonsense. We all got scared. Everyone needs to face the cops the first time. This is enough for me. - You'll need to get a new guy. - What'll we do? Everyone just goes home. Move the hours back a couple of hours and wake someone up. That's your alibi. And what's there to be afraid of? No one saw us. This is enough for me. - I'm not going out tonight at all. - Same here. MILLIONS STOLEN LAST NIGHT Hey boys! Look. "Robbery in the office of the industrial premises. The thieves took all the bills from the safety deposit box, amounting to at least five million marks. The crime squad is investigating the case." You get it now? - Now we're all in trouble. - But we didn't take anything. Someone's been there after us. It was that guy I saw sneak in. Let's go to the cops. It's the only way. No we won't. We won't say a word until we have to. Otherwise we'll end up in jail. - Hello. - Hello. I spent the night at Milja's place. Did mother say anything? I don't know, I was at Verna's place. I found this on the stairs to the fire door. Someone has been there recently. Go up to the attic to see if there's something there. The numbers of the bills are known, the radio just said. The thief will get caught and we'll be safe. - I just hope the police catches him. - Good thing we didn't get the money. That's the last time I'm playing a gangster. I'll turn into an angel as soon as they catch the thief. Just as I thought, it's not a former culprit. We'll have to look elsewhere. Could it be a mechanic? There are a couple of thousand mechanics in this city. I don't think there are as many young ones. Someone older wouldn't climb fire ladders. Maybe we should start at a lock factory. The culprit has clearly been doing that kind of work before. Get me the finger prints of mechanics at lock factories. I'll first go to the place where the safe was made tamper-resistant. Give me those cards for a moment. Well, I don't know. I should ask at the head office. I don't want this to be talked about, because it may be a false alarm. I'll take care of it in an hour. All right? This is the man who handled the drill. Martti Kuusi. Dammit, we're lucky! We've got him. So it seems. Didn't I tell you that Haapa is the best man around here? He knows who to put on track. Haapa? I've caught the drill. I mean the worker, the mechanic. Are you drunk or just insane? What did you find out? I found the mechanic who robbed the millions and dropped the drill that we took the fingerprints from. The one you wanted me to find, which is what I've done. Really? What's his name? Martti Kuusi. All right. Bye. We have enough soup as long as we have running water. How can you speak so badly of mother's wonderful soup? If tap water needs to be added, it's because of your bottomless belly. Mother wants me to become a priest, but I never got that far. I just got a stomach that's as bottomless as a priest's sack. Yes, we're a funny old family, we are. The boys are always hungry and the dad is always thirsty. Good day. Does Martti Kuusi live here? Yes he does, he's my younger son. Please come in. We were just eating. So please excuse us. Martti, someone's here to see you. I'm in a bit of a hurry. My car is waiting outside. Perhaps Mr. Kuusi could accompany me for a drive, so that we could talk. - Would that be OK? - Yes, I'll come. Please get dressed so that we can leave. Sorry to have disturbed you in the midst of your meal. - Goodbye then. - Goodbye. Who was that? One of the big shots from the factory? Not to my knowledge. Martti said something about looking for another work site. Maybe it was a new boss of his. Anyway, the soup is getting cold. Have you heard that Martti would have a new job in sight? He did say something like that... I wish he could find a good one. As said, this is a very sad case. We hope that you have a clear alibi. - By the way, this is probably yours? - No, it isn't. - It's not mine. - Oh, it isn't? Perhaps you left it in the office of the industrial premises. I've never been there. I spent the night at my girl's place. Is that so? Look here, young man... The fact that you came with me without even asking who I am already told me I was on the right track. If you confessed now, it would make things much easier for you. Listen. Just tell me how it all happened. Who was with you? Where did you hide the money? Well? I swear that I don't know who took the money. I didn't take a penny. You heard me, not a penny! You're making your own guilt all the more apparent. But we have time to wait. You can think it over. And think carefully. I'll be back in an hour. Young man, come with me. What is it? Are the cops after us? - The police have caught Martti. - What? Pertti said that someone came to fetch him. - I'm sure it was the police. - How do you know? Martti wouldn't have left us otherwise. - Now we're all in a jam. - Let me think a bit. First thing we've got to do is to get our hands on Pertti. Pertti, you're so different today. I've been thinking all day while scratching a rough surface. If only I could scratch the rough surface off myself, so that the good in me would surface. Do you believe there's something good under this ugly surface? I do, darling. Pertti, wake up. Wake up! - Are you sick? Should I get a doctor? - No...no doctor. I had a bad dream. Pertti, go to sleep. I'll make all bad dreams go away. NATIONAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION Who are you looking for? - For inspector Haapa. - The door is right behind you. Come in. I see... - Martti Kuusi's brother, right? - Yes. It's a sad thing for your brother. It seems that he has stolen millions of marks. He hasn't confessed yet. But we have so much proof that he can't deny it. Do you have something on your mind? I came to see you, inspector, because I've st... Haapa. Yes. The defense will take care of that. Yes. He'll be sent to the county prison, that's clear. Yes. Over. - You were saying? - Could I speak with my brother? If it's only possible. Unfortunately I can't guarantee it yet. Maybe later. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. TRAVEL TO CANADA - the land of great opportunities - Pertti, hello there! - I'll go over there. - Taking a day off in mid-week! - Sometimes you have to. That's right. I did the same. I left the lock company ages ago. - What are you doing these days? - Just business. Lucrative business. You have to take what you can get. - You mean capers? - A sharp head you've got there. A regular Sherlock Holmstr?m! You've fallen into bad company, boy. Better watch out. I'm just a small businessman, though. There are others who are making business in the millions. Didn't someone rob a million marks just yesterday? An amateur. He's been caught already. And he didn't get to use any of the money. - The police has all the numbers. - That's no problem. Kippura down at S?rkk? knows all the tricks. - Who is he? - That guy is the king of the crooks. That'll be enough for today, Peggy. You'll have to start tightening your belt. SECOND-HAND SHOP Now your tummy's full. Yes it is, little darling. Good day. Could I have a little talk? You thief! It's just Peggy. Come in. - What kind of business is this? - Pretty big. - Can I trust you? - I want to know the same thing. Storm ahead, storm ahead! Are you sure you spent the entire night with Milja? - That's what I said. - Right. I find it hard to believe, even though I'd want to. Do you remember seeing this man before? - No. - I see. This is the man you saw in the staircase? It's him, I could swear it's him. Thank you. That'll be all for now. Right. Do you want more testimonies? I guess we'll just have to bring in another witness. Please sit down. Sit over here next to Martti Kuusi. You're going out with long-term plans in mind? - I don't understand. - You're going to get married. Married? I never promised anything like that. - And it's none of your business. - Well, not otherwise... You seem like a decent lad. Getting married would require a lot of money. Oh yes. I'd think twice before marrying him. How can you say that? I'll say what I like. I hope you understand we're finished now. Did he spend the whole night with you? It's not my habit to keep men at my place until morning. Especially not children like him. - Milja, tell him. - I'll ask the questions. At what time did he leave your place? We had a smoke and... You don't get to do just anything with me. Shut up! I thought you liked me. Let go, you kid. I can go to jail. I was at your place. Do you hear? I love you. I didn't take any of the money. Do you hear me? Not a penny. Never, never. You've got to believe me. I didn't steal anything. I spent the entire night with her. - Tell them that I did. - Take the kid away. I thought you liked me... All right, miss. - Crazy kid. - So it seems. Seeing as he could make such a mistake in love, too. Milja! So the dollars will be here tomorrow. When the millions are here, you'll get the dollars. - But remember, the whole sum. - All right. A multi-million mark deal after all. Times are getting better. Times are getting better, times are getting better. I don't want to go see Pertti. He'll strike me. - Just ask him to come here. - What do you want of him? He's Martti's brother. Tell him that we can help Martti. Pertti must be at his girl's place. There's the address. Listen, stop dozing. The money hasn't been found nor have the culprits. Let's wait for a couple of hours. After that he'll confess. The kid is soft. And what's the point in hurrying? You've been lucky. You've become lazy as a camel. I think there's something fishy about this whole case. I'll go out on the town a bit. The burglary has now been practically solved, as the guilt of the suspect, Martti Kuusi, has been proven beyond reasonable doubt, says the police. It's suspected that he had accomplices who have managed to elude the police. Did you hear that? Martti Kuusi. My old colleague. His brother came to see me today and started saying this and that. Suddenly he started asking about Kippura, and then... Goddammit. Now I get it all. He's in cahoots with his brother. He's trying to get the money smuggled away with Kippura's aid. Five million. Does that say anything to you? No. Well, it does to me. A whole five million. That's a nice bundle of dough. Evening. Miss Anttinen said that you'd be here. - Could I come in and have a talk? - Please do. - Have you been celebrating? - No. Well, maybe with a drink or two. - Yes, yes. - No ashtray... The thing is that your brother is in a pretty tight spot and he probably won't be able to get out of it. We believe that he had accomplices. Maybe you would know who he has been seeing lately? - Do you know anyone? - No, no one. Well, he does have a girlfriend called Milja. Or something like that. We know her. She already testified. She said she had never seen Martti in the company of other boys. Those first-time crooks are cleverer than we'd think. I have to go now. Were you home that night? Home? I was here all night. - You're thinking of getting married. - That's what we've planned. Right. It's expensive to start a family these days. If you find anything out, give me a call. Goodbye for now. Believe me, I saw Pertti counting the money. I saw him through the letter door, packing money in a briefcase. That's when the cop came in and I got out. It was that Haapa, the guy we saw yesterday. Did you see him catch Pertti? You think I wanted to get caught myself? How do you know the police was there for Pertti? He wasn't there for a cup of coffee! Stop that! Then we're all in a jam. Pertti's going to squeal on us. That's a helluva betrayal Martti did. They had a deal Pertti would come once we'd cracked open the safe. It was easy to get the dough once we had split. Give me the keys! You think we're just kidding around, goddammit? Robbery and homicide will give you many years. Remember that, Boman. I haven't got the money. I didn't get them. And if I get them, you can be sure you won't find them here. They'll be here tomorrow. I think Peggy's right. You don't have the money yet. And I think you're waiting for them in vain. Let's go! Tomorrow we'll relieve our pal of his money burden a bit. We'll guard the street, the whole night if we have to. - We'll go away together. - Away? Where? To Canada. I've arranged all the paperwork. - I was going to bring it up earlier. - To Canada? What do you mean? Why? Why? Because everything's in a mess. They're making a crook out of me, just because Martti is in jail. I have to get out of here. Shouldn't you be here right now? - Just think of your mother. - I have my own life to think of. Don't worry about my mother. I'll leave her enough money to get by. Enough till I make more, which should be easy in Canada. Where did you get the money? I borrowed it. It's enough for us to get started. I still don't understand. I should've dared to do this earlier. But I'm going to do it now. I have to get away real quick. Do you understand? Away, away. If you love me, like you said, you'll come with me. You haven't told me everything. What are you hiding? What would I have to hide? Enough with the interrogation. Let's talk about the trip. What would you need? Clothes and things like that. Well? What would you say? I don't understand. I'm... I'm afraid. I'm beginning to think his brother was an accomplice. I went to see him and he was shaking like a leaf. Well, why not? Did you catch a trail? Not yet. I'll try to get the younger brother to lead himself to a trap. Let me spend some time with him alone. Well, young man. Come here. Sit down. Right. How is it? - Did you remember something new? - I've told you everything. Why can't you leave me alone? We'll do that once you've told us everything. That'll be it. I don't know anything more than what I've said. I see. So be it then. Your brother told us everything and gave the money back. My brother? What are you saying? Gave the money back? What money? Stop acting! The money that you stole together. Stole together? What are you talking about? Going on like that will lead to a nervous breakdown. Why do you want to hurt yourself? I don't want anything, I don't know anything. Why can't you let me sleep? I don't wish you any harm. I want to find something that can help you. Well... What can we do? We'll just have to wait. Could I have a cigarette? Well... I think we're getting somewhere now. Chin up! Let's talk things over man to man. I... I'll tell everything. We don't have the money and never did. Martti's brother has it. - He had it when you saw him. - Is he also involved? He's in cahoots with Martti. Martti told us to escape and let his brother get the money. Take the boys to the crime squad. We'll go see the other Kuusi boy. - Hello. Is Pertti Kuusi at home? - Pertti? I haven't seen him for a day, at least. - When was he here the last time? - I don't remember. Not today, at any rate... Not today. - Thanks anyway. - Thank you. - Excuse me. - Could you see me across the street? I'm going to a church concert and I'm already late. I'll take you across. Thank you so much. Could you also take me to the church? It's near by. All right, I'll take you there. There's no use crying. But you'll have to come with us. - But I don't know a thing. - There's always something. Let's go. Kuusi, come here. - You say you didn't take the money. - We didn't. Call Martti Kuusi inside. Martti Kuusi, come here. - We agreed there'd be no more lies. - Yes. You made a deal with your brother that he'd escape. Escape? Where? Abroad. He has the money. No use acting anymore. - Speak up. - You're mad. My brother! I told you he has nothing to do with this. - I give you my word of honor. - You can keep it. Your friends say that the two of you were in cahoots. You're lying. You know you're lying. Pertti wasn't in on the plan. You just want to blame this on him. He doesn't know anything about us. Believe me, he doesn't know anything about this. No, and keep your eyes open. If he escapes, you're fired. That goes for me, too. Got that? All right. Nothing new? If he hasn't escaped yet, he sure won't be able to do it now. Even a scrawny bug couldn't get past our guards. Don't be frightened. I haven't done anything wrong here. HAS THE MILLION MARK THIEF LEFT THE COUNTRY? Here's the money, all of it. I took it. National Bureau of Investigation. All right, I'll tell. I hope the rate of interest on the loan won't be too high. Martti, I'm... Could I see him? Just for a little while. Could I? Now you're tempting me to break the law. You see? It's easy to do when the temptation is too strong. Kuusi, come here. Pertti... Verna, can you ever forgive me? Will you wait for me, in spite of everything? I will, my darling. Subtitles by Veikko
