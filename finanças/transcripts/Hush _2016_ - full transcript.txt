You don't have to sign. Cool. John? So, what did you think? Thank you. Thank you. My mom calls it "writer brain". Makes me crazy. Any possible outcome is like a movie in my head... with many endings. A frustrating movie. Hard to make the voices quiet. I have a voice in my mind. It sounds like my mom. This means... kisser. kisser. This means storyteller. Jesus! I'm sorry. Fire alarm. I have to feel the vibrations. That is why it is so loud. When I am sleeping, the vibrations will wake me up. She is fine. Independent little bitch. B-I-T-C-H. Bitch. Have to work. I'm sorry. Keep it. I have got dozens upstairs. Kissing. Bitch. Hey, Squash. Abandoning the novel. Joining the circus. Which one? I have seven. Distractions abound. Craig texted me. No, but almost. I signed up for an online-dating site for the Deaf. No. There are four men in the whole area. Do not want. Never. Too loud. Isolation happened to me. I didn't pick it. Probably the cat. Bitch escaped earlier. Thank you. I have to find her. I love you. Kill him.
