(GLASS SHATTERING) (CALMING INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) So you know, sex is just another way of communication. If people fucked more there would be less war. Less killing, less rape, all that shit, know what I mean? Yeah, I think so. I mean it's just like, if people did what they wanted to do and as long as it didn't hurt anyone, it shouldn't be a problem. You know anything about the clit? Just what they say on South Park. Alright, so like nothing? Well it's call the clitoris and it's actually the only part of the human body that's designed and functioned purely for pleasure. It's just there to enable a girl to cum over and over and over again. So that means that if you can master the clitoris, then you'll be like set for life. You have one year until you're 17, and you know what that means, right? No. Age of fucking consent dude. And you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna fuck you until your eyes fall out.

I'd figure I'd just go by there later, when I'm done skating. No, that's the wrong order. You need to call him, go and see him and then go skating. You need to get a job, man, I tried to set this up with you last week and you never called him. I was busy last week. Busy doing what? Come on, man. You wanna talk about someone being busy, I'm busy taking care of your kids. I really don't want you to embarrass me by not showing up. - I'm gonna show up. - And we need this money. - Yes we do. - You know? And I'm gonna show up. Then don't talk to me about skating. I don't want to hear a goddamn thing about skating. Plus you have another baby with Donna. - I know. - You know? I've been caring the weight for both of you guys for the past two years with no help. I really didn't sign up for this. You know? I need some help and I'm not getting it. I mean have you spoken to Donna? Yeah, I speak with her sometimes. - You speak with her? - Sometimes. Oh, are you fucking her again? - Alright guys, c'mon. - I go to see my kid! Hey, hey. He's got a kid with her. You may not like the situation but that's a reality. He's a dad to two kids. Get off your ass, go get dressed right now, give 'em a call and go down there. (BANGS) It's almost 10 o'clock in the morning! C'mon Adam! - Seriously. - You just pissed him off. (SCOFFS) Yeah big deal. Jesus. Oh (MUMBLES) Fuck. (CRYING) Oh baby, come here sweetie. Oh come on, it's okay. Hi, hey, you okay? You alright? You okay honey? (CRYING) (SOMBER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (GRAVEL CRUNCHING) - The fuck are you doing? - (DOOR SLAMS) The fuck are you doing man? It's over. The fuck are you talking about? Come on baby. Adam? - Adam? - What are you doing in here? You can't just walk in like that. Take your kid. I'm done, I'm leaving. I'm done with this. I've been raising your kid for the last year and a half and your kid for the last three years, and I'm fucking done! I've had no support, no money and no family, and you've got plenty of that, so. You think I can handle two fucking babies? Yeah, well, it's your responsibility. If I have to stay here another minute I'm gonna blow my fucking brains out! Fuck you, all of you. That's not even my fucking kid! Get the fuck back here, you fucking dumb ass! Dumb bitch, what the fuck are you doing? Fuck you! What the fuck are you doing? Fuck outta here man. (ENGINE STARTS) Walk back here you fucking dumb bitch. The fuck man! Geez! (CRYING) What is this? A birthday party? (UPBEAT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (TRAIN HORN) Adam, can you throw this trash for me? Yeah, hold up. Like right now? I said hold up. Get up and throw out the trash. It can fuckin' wait. You don't, what the fuck is wrong with you, Adam? You need to grow up. (SIGHS) Don't smoke in here. I'll smoke wherever the fuck I want to, this is my trailer. Adam put that out. I don't have to. Adam. What? Stop being immature. I'm not being immature, you're being immature. You know what, your moms fucking right. You can't even get a job! Hmm, mhmm yeah. And you know, what the fuck were you last night? - I was out! - I didn't see you - for like a hour. - I was out. Out where? Out. I was out. Are you out fucking Donna again, - is that it? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm doing, yeah. Definitely. (SIGHS) You're such a fucking asshole, you know what, I stay here all day. I don't know where the fuck you go. Out skating and you just wanna come home and get high and fuck me. Exactly, that's all I wanna do. I've never fucked around on you, I can't even believe you knocked up Donna. It wasn't my fucking fault, I was drunk, it was my fucking birthday, it was not my fault. I've never been with anybody else but you. And I've never loved anyone else but you, but you're actin' like such a - fucking bitch. - That's a fucking lie! No it is not! You need to get the fuck up and start acting like a dad. Maybe I will when this joints finished. You know what, put the fucking joint out. I told you to stop - smoking in here. - Dude, are you fucking serious? Are you throwing shit at me? I'll throw what ever the fuck I want! Don't fucking throw shit! - Put the fucking joint out! - Don't fucking touch me! Stop fucking throwing shit at me! The fuck is your problem? I'm not even in love with you anymore. I'm not fucking in love with you. You think I'm in fucking love with you, all you do is bitch and bitch and fucking bitch! I'm fucking tired of it! That's all you fucking do! All fucking day, in my fucking ear. - All fucking day! - Because you don't even try - to pick up any slack! - Ahh! I've tried to get a fucking job! I've tried to get a fucking job! You don't fucking-- - You're lazy-- - understand that. You're a lazy fucking asshole. All you fucking do is sit here! You fucking go out and fuck whoever the fuck-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Nobody looks at me anymore! - Yeah. - I can't go out and have sex. You can go out and do whatever the fuck you want. You don't have a fucking job, you can't do shit on your own. You're a fucking mommas boy! Yeah, I can't do shit, I'm a mommas boy. Whatever, get the fuck out of my face. Are you fucking serious? Go to the kitchen-- - Don't push me! - Where you fucking belong. You need to take some responsibility-- - Responsibility! - For once-- - Yeah, yeah! - You're not a kid anymore, - Adam! - Yeah, yeah, I got it! I got it, responsi-fucking-bility! Jesus fuck! You ruin my fucking joint too. What the fuck is wrong with you? The fuck is wrong with you? (BIRDS CHIRPING) So were you able to get any sleep last night? No. I mean, I'm, no. I don't remember. You know I'm not sleeping well. Is he just getting up a lot during the nights? Yeah, he wakes me up, I mean, he gets hungry. He wants to eat and, then its just. (SIGHS) I just start thinking about everything and he cries and I hear Tom crying and its just fucked. You're going to have to do something about that, I think. There's nothing to do. But you're not in good shape. Well, when I was in good shape, that's what lead to all this. So it's pointless. Doesn't matter. No it does matter, you have to take care of this little boy. It's not just that. What else is going on? It's like, as awful as everything was it's my fault. None of this-- - That's not true. - would have happened-- - It's completely true. - It's not your fault. It's 100% true. It is not. And I think if you were in a little bit better shape, you would understand that that's really faulty logic. I was an idiot and I thought that I could help Tom and-- Why is trying to help someone being an idiot? I don't see that that has any validation whatsoever. Everything that happened was a direct result of my stupid actions. You don't think this guy embodied that violence before? He had a history of it, everybody knew that he was sexually violent. He was inappropriate with people, it was just a matter of time before he went off. It's like he knows, it like he knows what happened and I, and I try to hold him and I touch him, but I can't, it's like he can see that I don't love him. And he's right. But you've gotta come to terms with that, honey. You have to deal with that, this is your baby. He's his own person, he's not Tom. I don't think that you're-- I think that you see it too. Look I, I see a certain resemblance and it's hard because we were all traumatized by him but we have to just go on and I think if you got some help and were able to process this, you would be able to have a relationship with your son. The only way to do that would be to wipe my memory clean of what happened and there's no way to do that. Blow my brains out and then I'll forget. Oh come on, that's just not clear thinking and honey, the drinking doesn't help. It's the only way I can sleep. You never come out of the postpartum depression and you've never dealt with the rape. I mean, when did you realize this was Tom's baby? (CRYING) I don't-- Immediately. - I don't know. - When you were carrying him? No, I think I just hoped that it would be you know, Chachis's, Eric's, someone who I'd loved, and it's this. It's like-- I feel like every cell in his little body carries that moment. I know that he will grow into his own person and he needs time for that. And you need to love him-- What kind of person - can he grow into? - And give him-- - A monster like his father? - You got to set an example, you're all he has. I don't know where your family is, I don't know why they're not-- I don't want to talk about this anymore. I know it's really hard but it doesn't get better. Each day it seems to get worse with you and you are too young and he is too young. You've gotta get out there and have some sort of life or at least help me. I can't bring him up and I can't be here all the time and I'm actually really worried about him. Me too. (INTENSE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (INCOHERENT TALKING) That was some fight you had earlier today. What the hell Adam? You need to chill out a little bit. Hey. She's always the one starting it. It doesn't really matter, just try and tone it down, you know? Just a little bit, what are you guys fighting about anyway? She thinks that every time I leave the house I'm out fucking some other girl, she's stupid. Well, I don't know, you leave for hours at a time, who knows what the hell you're doing? Come here, come here. You know, if you had a job that you're going to then we would know where you were but she doesn't know and she's here stuck with a kid and feeling insecure, you know? Yeah. Which is difficult for her. Come here, baby. God, look at this guy. He's so cute, but looking at this baby's eyes. He looks exactly like Tom. It's kinda terrifying, I mean he's just a little boy and he's so sweet, but then sometimes when he looks at you-- - Yeah. - Don't you get that feeling? - Yeah, exactly. - And then it's really hard on his mom too. - Yeah. - Really hard on her. Is that why she's never here? Yeah. She's mainly in her room. She takes a lot of naps. I don't know, she just can't deal with it day to day. - I know. - After what happened. I don't think she's talking to many people. She just seems really out of it. She's gonna have to figure out what she's gonna do, but she's gotta get better before she can do it. I mean, Christ it's hard for her even to go to the store and talk to anyone. Much less trying to get her to interview or looking for something to do, I don't know. I thought I could help her, but I don't know if I'm doing a damn bit of good. And somebody needs to start working in this house. I know where this is going. Honey, I just need some help. I'm trying to get a job. - I know. - There's just really none here. I know. But if you talk to that guy, I know it's not the kind of work you want but I think he'll hire you. 'Cause I'm down to the dregs in my savings but I just think if you guys out there arguing in that trailer all the time and I think like, Jesus if they just were out looking for work, You know? But then the kids would always have to be with you. Well we could switch it off, I mean, it's not like you can find full time work in this town. You maybe able to, if I can get you on that crew. I'm not sure what it is, it's some sort of construction deal, I don't know. Those eyes, man. Wow, incredible. But he's sweet. I'll never forget any of that. He's dead now, we don't have to worry about him. (EXHALES) I know. There you go, keep it flat. Okay a little bit more, back and forth now. Spread it out, it's a big job, gonna go all day. (INTENSE GUITAR MUSIC) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (CALM GUITAR MUSIC) (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) That was beautiful. (GUITAR STRUMMING) Want me to keep playing? Yes. Okay. Another one. (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Come here. Come here Thomas. (LAUGHS) Oh, wow! What is that? What is that, baby? What is that? (LAUGHS) Come here, sweetie. Come on, let's go play. Wanna go play? Yeah? Let's go play, baby. (SOMBER INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (ROCKS CRUNCHING) (POWER LINES HUMMING) (CRYING) Come on, go play. Come on, come on. (CRYING) Hey, babe, be careful, Ty's asleep. He's inside. (SIGHS) (CRYING) Oh, come here. Come here. Come here. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. (UPBEAT COUNTRY MUSIC) I think you're fucking Miguel. He's very charming. I remember he used to flirt with me and I didn't care but, I guess this one time I took him to a party and there was a jacuzzi and so we got in. He started rubbing my leg and I just looked at him and I looked at his lips and realized he was so sexy. And I was like "You know what, I want a piece of that". So we started making out and he was such a good kisser. So we got out of the jacuzzi and went into these guest rooms, went into this one room and we were all wet and he was just in his boxers. And the sex with him was so crazy, it was unbelievable. I mean he just went straight down, started eating my pussy, eating all of it. (LAUGHS) I couldn't believe it. Like, a 17 year old kid and no one's good at eating pussy, but he's incredible. I mean, only like hardcore lesbians are good at eating pussy. And it was like there was a rhythm to it a beat. Kind of like music. And he had this little mustache, I never thought I would like some Mexican, latino mustache, but when he was eating my pussy it would just tickle me and then after that I was addicted to it. Then we started to fuck, but then the owner of the house walks in and was like "What the fuck are you doing". So we ran out of there and I'm like. "You're coming with me little one". I take him back to my house and I have this giant bed. And he tells me to take off my clothes and throws me down on the bed, we're rolling around and he's so sexy. I mean, it doesn't even make sense, he's just this 17 year old kid, but he was like a Dandy from the 1940's. And he was the fucking best. He had this way of looking into your eyes and making you feel like you were the last girl on Earth. That's the way he makes all of the girls feel. The other thing was that, I mean, he has a perfect penis. It's like a classic penis, you know, big, round, thick. (TRAIN HONKING HORN) I don't think Adam loves me anymore. Why? He just doesn't act the same, he's different. He doesn't look at me the same, he doesn't fuck me the same, he just expects me to be here when he gets off work. Shit. Sucks. I mean he doesn't even try to be a father to his kids, he doesn't try to be my lover anymore. I'm so fucking tired of it here. Then let's leave. Go where? To Austin. Why Austin? I don't know, there's a good music scene over there, it's way bigger, there's more places to play. I want to play my guitar, so that seems like a good place. You should come with me. Go with you. Hell yeah. You just want me to pick up everything and leave? Yeah. What about Thomas? - I don't know, I mean, - And Tai. I don't think they care, they just got out of the pin. We could take the Oregon shit and move to (MUMBLES), I don't want to me stuck here and you're too pretty to be stuck here too, let's get the fuck outta here. What about Adam? Fuck Adam. Well, I can't just pick up everything and leave. Yes you can. What kind of mother would that make me? - Donna? - No. But I really want you to come and I could make money and I could get shows and shit. I'm getting better at playing the guitars. I mean you don't have to come, I'm not kidnapping you or anything. I haven't had a girlfriend since I was 12 years old. And I love you. - You love me? - Mhmm. Since the second I saw you, I was like damn. You're amazing. - I think I love you too. - Mhmm. (MUMBLES) (EERIE MUSIC) (TRAIN HORN HONKING) (SOLEMN INSTRUMENTAL GUITAR) (MUSIC PACE INTENSIFIES) - What the fuck! - (SCREAMING) Shit. Shit. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) (BABY SCREAMING) (EERIE SLOW MUSIC) (WATER SPLASHING) (SLOW GUITAR STRUMMING) (WATER DRIPPING) (KNOCKING) Yeah. You killed my father. (GUNSHOT) I have a 9 year old son and my fucking ex-wife took him away from me and I didn't do anything. I love my son. I would never discipline him the way my father disciplined me. I would never use my fist, these hands are for love. The strap is for discipline. I just miss him. (WOMAN HARMONIZING) (GASPING FOR BREATH) (SLOW SPANISH MUSIC)
