...now fear that something has gone terribly amiss. Austrian officials fear the absolute worst. The hijackers have lowered the blinds on the plane. We've heard or seen nothing since that initial communication. We know that they've killed a flight attendant. The terrorism experts I'm speaking with say it would've been impossible for a small group of jihadists to have staged this hijacking on their own. Heads down! Everyone, down! Everyone, down! Down! Quiet! Quiet down! Quiet down. Quiet! Down! ...here in Vienna appears to have taken what we fear is the most tragic development of this situation. Hostages have been killed alongside... They just posted a video from inside the plane on the Internet. Now is the time we send our message. You brought this upon yourselves. We speak for all victims around the world. We speak in the language of the powerless. Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, we will strike back. Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. The Austrians say they're dead. The hijackers, the passengers, crew. Everyone. Celia! They've opened the books on Flight 127 back at Langley. No one wants to open that can of worms. Not after eight years. Headquarters feels differently. We've done this already. What went wrong, what could we have done better. We've been blaming ourselves ever since. They caught Ilyas Shishani. Three weeks ago in Afghanistan. He said the hijackers had help from inside our station here in Vienna. We believe him? Headquarters believes him. That's the only thing that matters. Send me. If anyone can get the truth out of Ilyas, it's me. He's dead, Henry. Wasn't in any shape to be interrogated. Somebody made a mistake. Did we at least get a name from him? We need to close the books on Flight 127 once and for all. Find out if we had a mole in our station. That's a Tehran number. From Bill's phone. Bill wasn't the only one using that extension. You know that. Hi. Hi, beautiful. And if it's her, you still carrying the torch for Celia Harrison? It's Celia Favreau now. Husband and two kids. Besides, no torch burns eight years, not without oxygen. Think she'll even talk to you? - We could send Mack to California. - Everything all right? He won't know if she's lying. Uh... Ballet class. Running late again. Will you? Isn't that why you're sending me? Bill's in London, right? Correct. I'll talk to him first, then I'll see about California. So, if it does turn out to be true... ...what do you want me to do? We can't afford the embarrassment of a prosecution. I need to know the man I send can do what's necessary. You gonna say it? No, Henry, I'm not. Treble. Piccolo, how are you? We still on? Carmel-by-the-Sea. I'm here. There's a chance it won't be necessary. I'll clear it with you beforehand. All you have to do is say yes or no. - Reservation? - Yeah. I'm early, though. - Name? - Favreau. I can seat you now if you'd like. I'll wait at the bar. Vodka martini. You have Tito's? Uh, sorry, we only serve wine. Really? - Wine country. - Sure. Um... let's try something very cold. Uh, white or rosé? Dry. Henry. Celia. It's been a long time. It has. You got gray. - I did. - It looks good. You look... exactly the same. C-Come here. Thanks for coming. Shall we? It's a nice spot. Yeah. You can't get a table on weekends. But the middle of the week, it's dependably dead. How is Carmel-by-the-Sea? Hmm? Indulging your love of the elderly? You've done it. You left everything behind. Yeah. This is not Vienna. I've noticed. This tastes funny. This is your soy milk, isn't it? It's arsenic. You busy today? Oh. Shit. Yeah. Vick. Vick has me looking into money laundering stuff. - Bankers. - Oh, yeah. Right? Can you have some breakfast? Bankers get up early. I guess I need to go, too. - Mm-mm. - Mm-hmm. To what? To old friends. Aw, you can do better than that. Okay. To old lovers. How's the office? Same as ever. Vick runs it like a fiefdom. You know that. - So you're still on the street? - No, no. Entirely air-conditioned now. Mm. Who'd have thought? Henry Pelham, office drone. Vick has me looking into Flight 127. Why? Too many inconsistencies. So this is an interview. I was in Santa Clara, and driving down was... I wanted to see you. But I also have to close the book on this. I thought you were here to see if we still had that old spark. Bill Compton. Geez. Henry. What are you doing here? - You get a transfer? - No. - Can I sit? - Sure, yeah. They have me looking into Flight 127. That's ancient history. It's done. - It was, and then it wasn't. - Huh. Is this, uh... This Vick's big idea? Headquarters. Right, right. They caught Ilyas Shishani. No. - Wow. - Yeah. Hey, now, that's a good thing, huh? - It is. - Yeah. We should order champagne. He said he had help from inside the station, Bill. - Our station? - Mm. He's lying. What are you having? Well, um, uh, it's a single malt. I'll join you. - You want anything else? - No. Ilyas died before we could get a name. And now there's an analyst at headquarters that wants to ride the lie, thinks we have some soul-searching to do. We did some pretty serious soul-searching back then. Here's the plan, Ce. I write a fat report, a rococo analysis of failures and successes, full of perspectives. Make the fucker's head spin. That'll get him off our back. I'm all yours. Let me give you a minute to come up with a suitable cover story. - Yes? - Ce? Who is this? Ce, it's... It's me. It's Bill. Bill? Oh, my God. Is everything okay? Yeah, no, no, it-it's fine. You sound good. I sound confused. Yeah. - Where are you? - London. Yeah, we moved a year ago. You hate London. Yeah, tell me about it. You know, it-it was for Sally. We... Oh, Bill. Listen, do you, um... you got a minute? Of course. Look, um, I've been out of the game a while now, but, uh, I thought I should call you. Talk to me. It's Henry. Henry Pelham. Go on. He's here in London. He's putting me through the wringer. I just thought I should warn you. Celia Favreau, 5:36 p.m. For the lady, grilled goat cheese with bitter leaves, miso, ginger and pumpkin puree. For the gentleman, burrata with cilantro oil, blood orange and maple-glazed free-range bacon. Mmm. Fields of bacon running free. It's a beautiful sight. - More wine? - Yes, please. Yeah, she's very pretty. How long are you planning to stay? You are the only girl in this town for me, Ce. Your bacon smells so good. Live a little. - No. - Live a little. Mmm. - So good. - Mmm. Thank you. December 2012. Paint me Celia's picture. How far back? Just tell me the basic stuff. What happened that day, what you remember about the station back then. We can work our way up to 127. Okay. Vienna was my second posting. I'd come off some tough years in Dublin. Why were they tough? Well, you know that I lost both my parents in a car accident when I was in college. And Dublin was just too slow. I had too much time to think. What was Vienna? It was the ultimate high. - We collected secrets... - Thank you. ...sometimes from the highest echelons of government. Vienna Station up on the fifth floor of the U.S. embassy. And our chief then, as now, Victor Wallinger. - Morning, chief. - Good morning, Harrison. I'll see you at the brief. I think his greatest talent was knowing who to bring on the team. - Leila. - Good morning, chief. Good morning. Flash cable came in from headquarters. We'll need an assessment at the morning brief. Take me through the team. Leila Maloof, collection management. You know, she grew up in a war zone. She had life experience that none of us had. Second in command after Vick was my dear boss Bill Compton. He was like a father to me. - Oh, Bill. - Good morning. Scarred from old skirmishes in Southeast Asia. Although he probably suffered more at the hands of his wife Sally. Probably? That's being generous. I've had files pulled up for the CEOs of those banks. And there was Ernst Pul. Captain Uptight. Worked liaison with Austrian intelligence. And then you'll remember Owen Lassiter. Mm. Poor Owen. He ran a team of code breakers and analysts. Only lasted a couple of months after 127, before he found himself a pistol in the storeroom, smuggled that home. And that particular day? What about my number one? Henry Pelham. Clandestine case officer extraordinaire. The brightest talent out of the Farm in years. They sent you directly to Moscow. You witnessed the Nord-Ost siege. Chechen militants took over the Dubrovka Theater. Russians pumped gas into the theater and went in. Killed nearly all the terrorists. Well over a hundred hostages, too. That kind of thing never leaves you, does it? Moscow was brutal. But I liked my job. And you? I was living the dream. I had a boss I adored, knew I was making a difference. And I had you. And then you left. Then Flight 127 happened. Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I'd like to welcome you all aboard to TA373, Flight 1-2-7 to Vienna. We'll be en route... It started with a cable from headquarters at morning briefing. You were out in the streets. Do the honors, Leila. "Expect within the next 72 hours "an airline-related event on a flight heading to Austria or Germany. "Departure port uncertain... Damascus, Beirut, Istanbul possibilities. "Group: Da'irat Al-Salihoon, "though primary actors likely recruits from outside of Somalia. Likelihood: high." Da'irat Al-Salihoon... didn't they split from Al-Shabaab a couple years ago? Shabaab weren't devout enough for them. It's not about devotion. I was being ironic, Leila. Al-Shabaab operate locally in Somalia. Al-Da'irat are international. They have collaborations all over the world. Terrorists in our backyard? What's our take? Mm, Germany, maybe, but not Austria. So what do they want? Troops out of Afghanistan? The Austrians only have a handful. The Germans have the third largest presence in NATO's Security Force. Maybe they want to free some fellow combatants from jail. Again, Germany's the one holding more than its fair share. But we're talking E.U., remember. You don't have to land in Berlin or Frankfurt to speak to the Germans. What about money? Not with Tehran bankrolling them. Then we got the message from Europol about Ilyas Shishani. He'd arrived in Barcelona two days before from Tehran. What did you know about Ilyas at this point? Chechen extremist. You ran him as a source in Moscow. He joined a group in Iran that was already working with Al-Da'irat, so it wasn't much of a leap to wonder if he'd arrived for Flight 127. - But you didn't know for sure? - No. None of us knew anything. Could've been bad intel. Excuse me, sir. Could you please remain seated? Everybody, calm! Stay down! Then we were called back from lunch. - No, no, no, no. - What's the situation? The plane landed, then they took it over. There are six Americans on board, and they've already killed a stewardess. The ambassador's on the phone with the minister of foreign affairs. We're scrambling a task force upstairs. - Who's talking to them? - No one. They issued their demands by calling a local TV station, closed the blinds and cut off all communication. - Do we know who they are? - Leila. The Turks have I.D.'d four: Suleiman Wahed, Saudi; Beslan Abdulayev, Chechen; Omar Samatar Ali, Somali; and Nadif Dalmar Guleed, also Somali. We've got their passport photos but not a lot more. They've separated the children. They did what? Nine children between ages five and twelve. They're in the front as human shields. My God. What are their demands? Five prisoner releases... two here in Austria, three in Germany. We have 24 hours. What's the likelihood of the Austrians and Germans giving in? We're still waiting to hear from Merkel's people. The assessment is that she'll fold. So we don't know, huh? God, fucking politicians. What we do know is that Ilyas Shishani is in Europe and may be coordinating this. All right, time to shake up our networks. Bill, Celia, that's you. Ernst, call in some favors with the Austrians. Owen, cut through the chatter, find out what they're planning next. - Sir. - And, Leila, I want you to dig deeper - into each one of these assholes. - Yes, chief. Hold on one second. - Yeah, Vick? - Change of plan. I got to go. Got 24 hours. Um, do we know anything more about it or no? Ilyas Shishani might be involved. I'll talk to my sources. Your family is connected. What are they saying? I don't know anything. Tahar? Is there another cell operating right now? Can we expect other hijackings? What are their capabilities? Anything. I told you. I don't know anything about it. Conversation at the mosque? You want to hear that people are taking sides? Of course they are. A few of the young ones are packing their bags. Headed for Syria. So Al-Da'irat is talking to people here in Vienna? I don't know. Can you give me names? It's too dangerous. His name is Ilyas Shishani. We think he might be here in Vienna. - I don't know this man. - Look harder. People are gonna die, Tahar. I don't know this man. Is there anyone else I can talk to? I'm sorry. - What's the word? - I got nothing. At least not yet. They're slamming doors in my face. What about your man Ilyas Shishani? Either they don't know or they're not telling me. Maybe we have to start asking the Austrians to break down some doors. How are you? Uh, I talked with eight people in the last three hours. No one's saying anything. They don't know who to trust. They seem scared. Even my regulars aren't talking. I'm in touch with the Muslim Women's Foundation downtown. - I'll see if they've got any leads. - Mm. Henry, Ce, we have contact with the plane. So why here? Carmel. I'm sure you could've chosen anyplace in the world. Good schools? Drew's idea? It was as far away from the Agency as I could get. Well, you got out clean. No one got out clean after 127. No, you're right. You know, two weeks after we arrived here, I got a visit from this guy Karl, with a "K." He tells me that Bill... my Bill, the one I've devoted a chunk of my life to... has been selling secrets to the highest bidder. Not to France or Russia or China, but to the Islamist extremists. Karl wants me to help bring him down. Flight 127, he tells me, is still fresh for the Austrians, and they're demanding answers. Did he have any evidence? - They were looking for a scapegoat. - Mm. What'd you do? I told him to go fuck himself. Good for you. But my point is... that Karl ruined me. After that visit, I got more disconnected. Started feeling like a ghost. You seem better now. Evan cured me. Kids change everything. Maybe I should have one. - It's not for the faint of heart. - Mm. - You think I'm too selfish. - Definitely. You know, I get the feeling you're trying to educate me about something. I'm just not sure about the subject. I'm sorry. I'm being a parent bore. Where were we? Ten minutes ago, headquarters received a message on the emergency line from Ahmed Najjar, one of our Middle Eastern couriers. He is on the plane. What? We got an agent on Flight 127? He's one of the passengers. - We verified his identity? - Headquarters did the vetting. He sent this message: "Four attackers, two guns. "Children in first class, rest in econ. "Two women critical. "No power equals no cameras. Suggest rear undercarriage attack." I'd say we have the upper hand. No, wait a second. For the past eight years, Ahmed has done nothing more than spike dead drops. He's 58, and he's not trained in any counterinsurgency. We have to negotiate. - It's too dangerous to storm the plane. - Negotiate? Have you read Al-Da'irat's manifesto? I have. March 2006. They will never accept anything less than their demands. Never. They'll kill themselves before they negotiate. They did that in Kinshasa. - You remember that? - Mm-hmm. They burned everyone alive inside the central police station, including themselves. These guys do what they say. They do not go back on their word. Any news from the Germans? The Germans are sending their prisoners here to Vienna, but it's a delaying tactic. Merkel will never let them go. - Thinks it's political suicide. - And the Austrians? They're gonna play tough, particularly now the Germans aren't bending. So if the Germans and Austrians won't give in to the demands, our only option is to storm the plane. No, no, no, no. W-We're not storming anything. Our job is to advise the Austrians and just hope they don't fuck it up. So how do we advise that this be accomplished? Henry, you have field experience with these people. What's your take on it? Undercarriage. Just like Ahmed suggested. It's been done before. Uh... some passengers will be killed, but it's better than all of them dying. Won't they see us coming? That's why they called the media, right? The Austrians will cordon them off, get the broadcasters to play a loop. If we don't get on that plane in the next 20 hours, it's gonna be a bloodbath. Let me see what I can do to pressure headquarters. I'm sorry, chief. I have a meet. You're leaving? The Muslim Women's Foundation. They could have a lead. One second, Celia. We want to keep this quiet. We don't want anyone to find out about our friend Ahmed. Not even our people out there. Absolutely. Sir. You left the station to meet someone. It turned out to be useless. Who was it? One of my regular contacts, Sabina from the Muslim Women's Foundation, although she couldn't stay. So Sabina had brought her friend Tahar. This woman Tahar said that she would introduce me to someone who could answer my questions. Give me your phone. Your phone. Quick. Please. She's lying. Celia Harrison. As-salamu alaykum. Wa alaykum as-salaam. Can I offer you a cigarette? I was told that you had information about Flight 127. What we need to settle first... is the question of compensation. We need power. Power comes from money. When a man cannot get money power, he will then reach for violent power. You agree? Do you have information or not? You do not trust me? I meant no offense. Moment, please. I don't think he had anything. It was just an attempt at easy money. You all right? Yeah. - It's gonna be a long night. - Yeah. Celia. - You, too, Henry. - Yeah. So there's been another message. Ahmed tells us that one of the hijackers on the plane was speaking in Russian on a cell phone. Ilyas Shishani speaks Russian. Yeah, well, you know, it... it means something or it means nothing. Ilyas was your source in Moscow, Henry. Y-You want to tell me what happened? Hmm? Back then? All I know is you were transferred out. It didn't end well, no. Who was he handed off to? He wasn't handed off to anyone. What do you mean? Ilyas was only the second source I'd turned. He escaped Grozny in the '90s, eventually put together his own shop in Moscow. He was a hard worker, a loyal husband. Gave me an ear into the Chechen community. - How are you? - How's the family? - Good. - Good. I'd built a relationship with him based on trust. - It's ten degrees below zero... - I liked him. He liked me. We liked each other. He was a good man. Are you sure this can happen? Of course. You have my word. For me, the most important is my family. When the Nord-Ost siege happened, Putin dressed it up as the Russian 9/11, and D.C. bought it. On our side, no one wanted to be responsible for another Trade Center. These are extraordinary circumstances. And that's when the Russians came to us saying they had evidence of an imminent attack on our embassy in Budapest. But they wouldn't give it to us without a trade-off. If there's a threat to one of our embassies, we got to know what that is. Could mean the lives of hundreds of our guys. If the Russians want something from us... And the brass started talking about giving up a source, and they landed on Ilyas. Look, uh, I know you spent a lot of time with the guy. We... we all spend a lot of time building and maintaining these relationships, but their value to us is in how they're used. This is a bunch of fucking bullshit is what it is! We gave up a source? My source. Christ, Henry. I didn't know this. I'm sorry. All-all this time, I've been thinking it was you that fucked up in Moscow. They traded me out in case the Russians used Ilyas to get to me. He ended up in Tehran. But he was never radical when I knew him. He trusted me, he was my source, and we fed him to the Russians. You think you can find him? We're wasting our time. We need to get inside that plane or give them what they want. Yeah, well, um... let me talk to Vick. These people don't fuck around, Bill. We do not want them to lose their patience. Henry, there's a process, okay? Let me talk to Vick. We'll see where these fucking politicians are at. Shit. Hey. It's okay. It wasn't your fault. It's so simple, when you cut through all the lies and the doublespeak, but we take care of our own. All those strangers, they're not us. This is us. I only ever want to be responsible for you. You know, I've been thinking. Move in with me. I know what kind of people we are. I know we hold off and we're careful. We wall ourselves off, but, uh... I won't lose this. I can't. I love you. - Do you love me? - Yeah. Can I get you more wine? I think I'm gonna try a red. Would you like to see the wine menu? - Whatever you recommend. - I'll see what I can find. Thanks. Mmm. You'll love this. Say what you like about California, the fish is fresh. I don't touch land animals anymore. You certainly enjoyed that bacon, didn't you? Yeah, 'cause you told me to live a little. Live a little more. I've lived plenty. Uh, I'm so sorry. It's okay. We got it. Excuse me. This will soon be over. Once our brothers have their freedom, you will be given yours. Brothers and sisters... You are taking part in a great struggle that comes from a place of love. Love of Allah. Love of our parents and children. Grandfather, I know you understand the situation. There's been another message from Ahmed. "Cancel the attack plan. "They have a camera on the undercarriage. "I do not know how, "but it is clear they know what they're doing. "I suggest we give them what they are asking for or everyone will end up dead." Jesus Christ. How did they get a camera on the outside of the plane? All it takes is a baggage loader to attach it to the hull. Could've been done in Istanbul. Has anyone seen this camera? Hmm? The Austrians have had eyes on that plane all day long. Nobody saw anything out of the ordinary? Just because we don't see it doesn't mean it's not there. - Jesus. - And what do the Austrians say about the message? The Austrians don't know about Ahmed. We're trying to keep it quiet. There's a plane full of terrified people whose lives are at risk, and we can't tell the Austrians about Ahmed. It's Langley's call. - Ernst? - You know how it is. We didn't vet the Austrians. Celia's right. We have to start sharing our intel. I remember Bill left the office that evening shortly after we got Ahmed's third message. You know why? Sally had come down with one of her passive-aggressive illnesses. I, uh... I have to go home. I'll probably come back later. - You'll call me, will you? - I will. I haven't had a chance to lock up. Will you do that for me? I'll see you later. Good night, Bill. Sally was always his perfect excuse. What are you saying? I'm sorry, are... are you accusing me? Do you know how many years of my life I've given to my country? Hmm? The lies, the duplicity? We all gave. Nobody forced you. Yeah, well, you just take a look at your future, huh? This is what you end up with. My balls are still firmly attached. - Fuck you. - How's Sally? God, you fucking cunt. How dare you accuse me? Bill, when I accuse you of collaborating with America's enemies, you'll know it. There'll be two big guys behind you holding on to your arms, and we won't be in a fucking pub. We'll be in a Romanian basement. Yeah. So Bill left the office to deal with Sally... when was that? Around 9:00, 9:30. And you used his office after that? What was everyone else doing? We were just trying to stay on top of the situation. Owen was doing his cyber work. Ernst and Leila were talking to their contacts. Vick was briefing Washington. And you? I was going over the intel again to see if there was anything we'd missed. Sometimes wondered if Ilyas chose Vienna because of you. Why would he do that? I don't know. To goad you? I don't think Ilyas chose Vienna because of a personal vendetta. "Four attackers, two guns. "Children in first class. Suggest rear undercarriage attack." "Cancel the attack plan. They have a camera on the undercarriage." "Lead hijacker on phone. Speaks Russian. Don't know to translate." "I do not know how, but it is clear they know what they are doing." "I do not know..." "Don't know." Ahmed was our best shot at getting those people out alive. But something wasn't right. Of course we noticed the difference between Ahmed's last message and the first ones. Uh, you know, complete sentences, as if he suddenly had all the time in the world for good grammar. No one did anything? Well, later on, Vick called me into his office, and we discussed the elephant in the room. - Just the two of you? - Yeah. Yeah, we had to deal with the possibility that this wasn't Ahmed we were talking to anymore. And if he'd been discovered, who blew his cover? Uh, not even the Austrians knew he was in there. Did you discuss it with Celia? No, no. She had to be considered a suspect along with everyone else. There was an anomaly. Ahmed told us the layout of the hostages, suggested a plan of attack, then suddenly his tone changed and he was telling us to cooperate. Maybe he realized his attack plan wasn't gonna work. It wasn't just that. Why did he suddenly sound like a different person? Afterwards, when headquarters sent counterespionage, how did you explain it all to them? I didn't. No? No. Well, there was no point. It was done. We'd failed. If we started shouting "mole," that would've been it for all of us. Did you suspect that someone in our station had betrayed Ahmed? Well, it couldn't have been the Austrians because they didn't know he existed. Is that why you asked for the phone logs? What did you find? Well, you looked over those phone logs yourself. Didn't you? Why was Celia looking at the phone logs? I didn't know she was. That night, right after you left the office. What do you think she found? I don't know. I don't know. Why don't you tell me. What would she do if she discovered the boss she adored had placed some questionable calls from his phone? Calls to Iran. What? A direct call from your line to a number in Tehran. Half a minute long, 9:03 p.m. It boggles the mind that someone so immersed in clandestine affairs would make a call from his own office phone, but stupidity runs international relations as much as anything else. You're looking for a scapegoat. Hmm? Anyone could've used my phone. I mean, you could've used it yourself. Huh? Celia? Vick? Let's not play the name game, Bill. We don't do that. It's beneath us. We look at the evidence. We follow the facts. Only two people had access to your office phone, so don't fuck around with me. You do not want to end up on the wrong side of my investigation. So talk to me about Celia. Yes? Who's this? Is the waitress all right? Sir? She seemed... I don't know... distraught. Oh, she's fine. Actually, she's two months pregnant. Oh, that's amazing. Yeah, morning sickness all day long. Oh, poor thing. Yeah, she's heading home early. - But I'll take care of you from here. - Hmm. - Wish her well, then. - Yeah, I'll do that. Why don't you pin it on Owen Lassiter? He killed himself after all. It was never explained, not really. A love affair that went bad, but it went bad after 127. Guilt destroys his relationship. Guilt and loneliness destroy him. It's a perfect little narrative, and he's not around to defend himself. His uncle sits on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. What about Ernst? Ernst is advising the DDO. He's beyond my reach. Mm, there's an easier patsy. She was a regular at the mosque. She cried so much at the end. Remember? And what about you? Vick cleared me. Really? Look, I don't want to do this any more than you do. - Hey, did you see it? - What happened? This happened ten minutes ago. They killed a passenger. It's fucking brutal. Take away your spy! It's the things that we don't know that get to me. What happened inside that plane? Can't let it go. And what if I'd been one of the passengers? Would I have fought back? And with Ginny and Evan, the nightmares have become unbearable. In my dream, I'm paralyzed. Grasping onto the hope that if I do everything that they say... ...everything's gonna be all right. Children. - All the children! - Give me the children now! Please don't hurt them. - Please. - The children are coming with me now. - Please. - Mommy! Come on. Mommy! No. Why are you taking them? No crying. I never save them. I'm sorry. What's the latest? The attack's off. The Austrians got scared when Ahmed was killed. Are they gonna release the prisoners? Well, Merkel's flown her prisoners here, but they're still insisting on negotiations. Where are you? At home. Just about to leave. Wait for me. There's one thing I can't figure out about that night. We're at the station. We're gonna move in together. You look at the phone logs, Ahmed dies... ...and then you come home to me. The next morning, you left me. What we had was real. Wasn't it? I thought so. Why did you run? I think I preferred this being an interrogation. Well, you've convinced me. Of what? That you're very convincing. Are you okay? Be right back. Everything going to plan? Piccolo? Treble. What the fuck are you doing here? Scouting the territory. Oh, you mean how did I know who you were. Everyone has their methods. You look older up close. You shouldn't be here. Well... they nearly didn't let me in. Guess I'm not dressed well enough. Almost had to make a scene. So... we still on? I don't know. I'll clear it with you beforehand. All you have to do is say yes or no. Tell me about the investigators from counterespionage. They were dicks. Well, what did they say about the phone logs? They didn't say anything. When you told them about the logs, I mean. I didn't tell them about the logs. You suspected Ahmed had been betrayed, you found a suspicious call... ...and you didn't tell headquarters? You know what I thought when I found that number in the logs? I thought that Bill had been selling us out. I didn't understand why or how he'd gotten roped into this mess. And then Ahmed was killed... ...and I ran straight to you. They killed Ahmed. What? They shot him in the head. Shit. Shit. We both know that Bill didn't make that call. If not Bill, what, then? All this diversion. Do you really think that it makes a difference? What's wrong? There's a clock on this. And it's going to end. We just do the best we can. You were the only one who knew Ilyas from before. There's a plane full of terrified people, and we can't tell the Austrians about Ahmed. The only one with a connection. Ernst? You know how it is. We didn't vet the Austrians. - Celia's right. - You knew this left you vulnerable, so you planted this information in case there was an investigation. You had no right. All the fucking lies. Even between lovers. Are you okay? Yeah. I'll see you at the station. I saw the number on your phone. The last morning, when you were in the shower. 120 people. Children. Who are you? You know who I am, Ce. Now is the time we send our message. You brought this upon yourselves. We speak for all victims around the world. Just as your missiles continue to strike our people... ...we will strike back. No! Follow up with headquarters! Allahu Akbar. ...with the Austrians. I need to know... Allahu Akbar. The Austrians say they're dead. The hijackers, the passengers, crew. Everyone. How do they know? About five minutes ago, the Austrians got a message, "Al-Da'irat does not negotiate." They had hi-res cameras on the cockpit. Both pilots died in their seats. Shot? We believe they were suffocated. Sarin. It's sarin gas. We need to bring in doses of atropine and pralidoxime now. No, no. W-We can't go in until we know more. So, what, we just let them die? They just posted a video from inside the plane on the Internet. When they were all killed, I didn't know what to do. Maybe you were innocent. Maybe that number wasn't connected to Ilyas. I can't say that I believed it, but I wanted to. Because I loved you. So I buried everything that I'd seen... - Celia! - ...and I left. And then eight years later, you come after Bill? And me? You would destroy my life... ...to save your own. Karl Stein? This is Celia Favreau. He's outside, third bench on the left. We got the restaurant. Flying in a waiter and a bartender from D.C. A couple of guests, too. I don't know if I can do this. You came to us, Celia. You knew what it meant. Freddy will take care of it. Don't touch his wine glass. How do I know I'm out of this for good? Two independent sources, same story. Good enough for me. After this, I don't ever want to hear from you again. - You have my word. - Fuck your word. Just leave my family alone. Who's that? Henry, Henry, listen to me. They're gonna say that it was suicide. You don't have much longer. Oh, wine country. I just don't understand why you did it. Why, Henry? I did it for you. Because I love you. I don't understand what you're saying. His name is Ilyas Shishani. We think he might be here in Vienna. People are gonna die, Tahar. I don't know this man. I'm sorry, chief. I have a meet. Henry. Ilyas. It's been a long time. What are you doing here? Come. Remember Moscow, Henry? You spoke about trust so much that I almost believe you. Are you behind it? The hijacking? You gave my name to the Russians. Spetsnaz. Tough men. For six months, I did not see the sun. I've been tortured. My leg. Broken and reset badly. They call me a terrorist. Timid Ilyas, who breaks bread and... gives secrets to the Americans. What do you think this did to my daughter? She saw her father beaten to a pulp, taken away. She didn't know if I was dead or alive. I searched for you. I couldn't find you. We fled to Iran. My daughter dies there. Only six. Because they... don't have medicines. Why? American sanctions. Take out your phone and call your lover. Celia Harrison. What? - Do it, please. - Why? - Do it. - What do you want from me? Do it! Henry Pelham. She's with me. Listen. Celia Harrison. As-salamu alaykum. Wa alaykum as-salaam. I was told that you had information about Flight 127. Ilyas, listen to me. We can work this out, whatever you want. If you want money, I can get you that. If you want immunity, I can get you that, too. Calm down, Henry. Do you have information or not? I just want to make sure you'll answer my questions. You do not trust me? I meant no offense. You will tell me what Americans and Austrians know. You will tell me what they are planning. I-I can't do that. I cannot do that, Ilyas. We have her in a room, Henry. We need power. Power comes from money. When a man cannot get money power, he will then reach for violent power. Direct attack, undercarriage. Let her go. You agree? - Let her go. - I know there is more. Let her go! Tell me with your information how much she's worth. I had to give him something. Ahmed's identity. I kept hoping they'd storm the plane, that they'd... ...release the prisoners. I made a choice, and I chose you. Salaam alaykum. Life is so precious, Henry. They already had your name. Ilyas told them. I was just confirmation. I thought I had a chance. That maybe we had a chance. All these years. I'm so tired. I'm sorry. I love you. You should go. No. No, no. You should go. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't... why didn't you t... I'm sorry. It's okay. Don't touch me. Piccolo. Treble. I've got her. Right here in front of me. I can do this clean, but it has to happen now. Should I proceed? Piccolo? Was that a yes? Piccolo, I need a yes. It's done. You're still up. Let's get you to bed. Mommy, you're squeezing me.
