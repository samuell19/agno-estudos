This is the place. Take it easy, leave some for me. Are you sure this is necessary? I don't think so. True friends never quit. I've made up my mind. I've decided to do this. Thank you both for sticking by me. You two are my best friends. I feel so blessed. Thank you. Girls, are you ready? Ready! We'll always... always stick together! "Ten days ago..." Who is it? Coming. Can I stay with you for a few days? I need to calm down. What's wrong? Don't tell me you broke up with Qiaoli... It's all right. Stay as long as you want. I never thought I'd see this day. Listen to this. Okay. Stop crying first. I'll listen now. Don't cry. I've had a failed marriage. You had a boyfriend that you almost married. We both have had heartbreaks before we met each other, as if God was playing a joke on us. But I cherish this second chance I was given. I cherish you. Are you willing to stay with me for the rest of our lives? Xiwen... would you be my wife? What's wrong? He wants to marry you! But I can't decide... Oh, right... Look. He gave me this. Pretty, eh? It's super beautiful. If you don't like him, why did you accept the ring? I like him, I love him. But... what if he turns gay? What if his mother is mean? What if we don't get along? What if he cheats on me? I'm so afraid, I don't... Stop thinking for a moment. Between you, me, and Xiaomei, you're the first to get married. So I'm giving you a present. That's what you should focus on now. What's that? I'm going to throw you the funnest, craziest and wildest... bachelorette trip! Xiaomei has been filming in Vietnam for 3 months. She'll know the best spots. She says we can visit the Saigon Opera House during the day. At night, we can go... Do we have to bring her? I'm not sure. Where are you going, Sis? Take me with you. Listen to me. A bachelorette trip means whatever we do, wherever we go, and whatever we see, must be kept secret from your brother, Qiaoli. Okay. If not, you'll be raped a hundred times. I'll book three tickets now. Make it four. Why four? You're not inviting that bitch, are you? You know we've been archenemies since grade school. - Xiwen, you're getting married! - Jialan! I'm so happy for you. Thank you. Listen, my boyfriend and I just got back from Paris. I bought you lots of gifts. I even got you a bag just like mine. For real? You've always wanted to dine at a Michelin-starred restaurant. I booked us a table for tonight. We're best friends, we must celebrate your engagement. We can talk all night. Let me introduce. Jinjin... Qiaoli's sister. - Hi. - Hi. Your outfit is adorable. It goes with your hairstyle, where did you get it? Online. - It's gorgeous. - Thanks. So pretentious. Kimmy? No way. It's Kimmy? Why? What's wrong? Don't you recognize me? Is it dementia? Do you need me to recommend a doctor? I was going to say it's only been a few years, but I almost don't recognize you. Look at those dry patches... Your face has lost all its collagen. You need to take care of yourself. Thanks for your concern. All these years... You must have eaten lots of corn? Your skin looks yellowish. She said eating corn makes your skin yellow. How can she be so ignorant? Didn't she study in the US? Listen... We decided on Vietnam for our bachelorette trip because Xiaomei is filming there. We can visit her as well. - No? Vietnam? - Yes. Xiwen, there are so many places to go in the world like Greece, Song Joong-ki's favorite. We can go there instead... Song Joong-ki's Greece is wonderful. Go there yourself. We're going to Vietnam. You can't do that. Without me, this bachelorette trip won't be the same. Besides, I've known Xiwen longer. I've got to be there for you, right, Xiwen? It was just a week longer. But you and I have gone through more together. It's quality not quantity that counts. Where were you when she was heartbroken? I wanted to be there. I wrote you a hundred letters! - Do you wash her? - I wrote her everyday! Let's toast to our bachelorette trip! Stop checking yourself out. Can't you give me a hand instead? This trip isn't just about you. It's a duel to the death for Jialan and I. And remember you love me more. You'll be on my side, won't you? See that? She's so unfair; How could she change her clothes? See that? How do I look? Am I pretty? I feel so good. The weather here may be hot, but I can feel the breeze on my back. Ew... why didn't you change? You stink. See you outside. See that? Xiwen. How many times have I told you I hate her? She never plays fair! How could she change without telling me? Xiaomei? It's so unfair! This was me in high school! Wasn't I cute? That was me! Xiaomei was so thoughtful. [Vietnamese] I wasn't waiting for you! Go away! Hey, Mister. Give it to me... don't give me that look. Let's switch places. Look closely. That's her. That's her. That's her. It was too dry on the plane. He's blind. No way... Why would Xiaomei send a cheap van for us? I got through to Xiaomei. Xiaomei! You've arrived! I'm still on set, I can't join you until later tonight. But I've arranged for your first outing in Vietnam... You're going to a party hosted by my film investor. I haven't been to a party in ages! He's the richest man in Vietnam. Make sure to dress up. Xiwen, this is your last party as a bachelorette. Make the most of it. I am coming! I have to go now. See you tonight, bye! Bye! Come this way! Okay... - Why? - What is it? Look at his chest. My name is Bao Son. I'm Vietnamese Chinese, single. You must be Xiaomei's friends. I thought Xiaomei was pretty, but her friends are even prettier. I'll take good care of you tonight. Thanks, you're so kind. You're super kind. - What's your problem? - Thank you. See that? Come inside. Let me show you around. Bye. That's your friend? Look at this. Isn't it beautiful? These chandeliers are gorgeous. It's super beautiful. - Really? - Yes! Look at this place. Welcome to my mansion. What's that? I've prepared a lot of shows tonight. Excuse me. - Be careful. - Thanks. It's so beautiful. The knife thrower I hired had an emergency. So I had my chef replace him. His knife skills are just as amazing. Paolo, blindfold yourself. What's he doing? It's so dangerous. She's injured! Shouldn't we help her? Don't worry, her boobs are fake. Come. Let me show you something interesting. Water coming out... Boss, the man who stole your chandelier... I already took care of him. Good. Put the eyeballs in the yellow safe. The yellow safe is for fingers. What was I thinking? I meant the red safe. Ladies. Meet Tran Ha, my right-hand man. These are my honored guests from China. We must take good care of them. Blood... Sorry, I ate some jam earlier. Don't be afraid. She's joking with you. Clean up and collect a shipment for me. Call me when it arrives. Yes, sir. She was just kidding. Excuse me, ladies, I need to get changed. Am I the only one who thinks it isn't safe here? I feel the same! Why don't we just leave... Don't worry. My boyfriend deals with men like him all the time. You'll be fine, just follow my lead. Let's go. What a braggart. People give face to your boyfriend, not you. If something really happens, who knows who will save who? I don't think this man is as bad as he looks. We might have jumped to conclusions. Everything seems fine so far. My honored guests... We have friends from China joining us today. Let's welcome them with a round of applause. I've always wanted to sing this duet in Chinese... "Wordless Ending." Who knows this song? I once told you this would be a wordless ending that would fade away with time. I once said that if I were to leave you one day, there would be no tears on my face. Em ơi, em ơi lòng anh đang chơi vơi (Honey, please, I'm playing with you) tiếc thương duyên bấy lâu. (sorry for that time.) She can sing in Vietnamese! When did she pick it up? Impressive! What language is that? Is Kimmy making it up? You weren't singing in Vietnamese. Who told you it was Vietnamese? I was singing in Thai. Then say something in Thai. Oh, right. I haven't called your brother yet. I'll make the call outside, it's too noisy. I'll get some juice to calm my nerves. Where's Kimmy? Where's Kimmy? One, two, three, go! Way to go, Kimmy... She's awesome! In this competition... Kimmy is the winner! Is there anyone who wants to challenge her? Is there anyone who wants to challenge her? There is! There is that... Bitch! Come on! Come on over! I'll pass. Come on! All of you, repeat after me. Jialan has no guts! Jialan has no guts! Jialan has no guts! Jialan has no guts! Jialan has no guts! This is my last party as a single girl. Let's go together! Coming! We're coming! Let's go... Coming! Hello. Hello, everyone. I'm getting married. This is my last party as a single girl. I decided to go wild one last time with my best friends. They're my best friends! Last chance to surrender. Keep telling yourself that. How wild you are! We gonna play hard tonight. Let's raise the game! Hey you, bring over our strong stuff! You guys ready? Bring it on! Come... Wine... These are rare wines with great taste. But not many people can stand them. So, are you guys ready? We're ready! 3... 2... 1! Second round. Let's party... let's party guys... Hold on! Eat it! She's the winner! Winner! Wow... I almost got drunk. This ring is important to me. The original owner had slender, beautiful hands like yours. It's my wish that you wear it tonight and drink with me. Would you? So you have a hand fetish. Fine, let's do it... Put it on. It's so big. Where did you buy this big stone? I want to buy a few too. Tell me, where can I buy some? Who's that? Wait for me. What is it? Boss, the shipment arrived, it's ready for you to inspect. All right. I have business to attend to. Wait for me here. It's huge... is it fake or real? Bite it. The ring! Where is it? Kimmy. Kimmy. Kimmy. Where are you? Kimmy. Kimmy, you're here, right? We're in trouble. I've called Uber. Let's go, the car is waiting. - Let's go... - Okay... Here... Follow me. Get out of my way. Wait! This is the car I called. Look... This is the car I called! Stop! Hello! Come! Driver! Don't you know my boyfriend? I'm calling him now! Open the door or you're fired! That's right, open up, driver! She looks so strange. Hey! Are you done? Do I look like a chauffeur? Bunch of drunk bitches! Get lost! She's scary! Wait... Our car is the one behind us. Now I see it. Sorry. Let's go! Bye... go away... Bye. Where's the door? On the other side. Bye... Goodbye. I can't shut the door... "To Cambodia." What... What are these? What happened? I'm handcuffed! How? Me too! Who am I handcuffed to... Why am I handcuffed to you? You! So heavy. It's heavy! What is it? What is it? A bomb? No ticking - it's not a bomb! What happened last night? Hold on, my phone... I found it, I found my phone. Oh, right, where's Jinjin? Jinjin! Shut up! I lost Jinjin! What do I do? - It's okay. - Qiaoli will never forgive me. Xiwen... when did you get a tattoo? Tat... too? What tattoo? I don't know. A figure and some letters, it's unclear. Really? How big? This big! No... Only this big. This big? What if Qiaoli sees it? - We should be more worried about Jinjin missing. - Don't cry. Finding Jinjin takes priority, right? - Let's find Jinjin first. - Jinjin is missing... Let's borrow some clothes and look for her. - Let's find her first. - It's okay... It's alright, let's find her. But we can't walk around naked to search for clothes? It's in Korean! Maybe there's a handsome Korean guy inside? Hello! Anyone here? "That beautiful day when I met you." "Do you still remember?" "Everything stopped at the moment I saw you." "I could only hear my heart pounding." Wake up. Excuse me... Do you have any clothes that you can lend us? What happened to you? We just woke up on the beach like this. - It's ridiculous. - Listen, trust me, shit happens and I know too well. - Alcohol is hard to resist, right? - Yes. Just come to my room, I'll see what I can find you girls to wear. Thank you. What's up with you two? Let's go. Move. You've got so many championships! Oh, yes. Do you like watching boxing? I'm half American, half Korean. I won most of my fights in both the US and Korea. You're mixed? Yes. Do you speak Korean? My name is Dragon. You're so cute. Thank you, Dragon oppa. Call me Jialan. - Excuse me? Hello! - Yes I thought you were going to lend us some clothes. Oh yea, in there... help yourself, please. Dragon oppa. Excuse me. Excuse me. Tony, come on, get out of there... I forgot Tony's in there. Get, get... Please, don't be afraid. I'm sorry, I had no idea Tony was in there, please forgive me. My father raised Tony; Tony thinks he's a dog. He's very obedient. Don't worry. Please help yourself. What's so funny? Let's just get some clothes. Why doesn't he come over? Don't bother. What's going on? Excuse me. Yes? These are all shorts? Yes, that's all I wear, shorts. So your tops are... Nowhere, there are no tops. I'm the topless king! Move your arm... You move away. Wow, good looking, ladies, looking real good! Excuse me. Do you think you can break this chain for us since you have such "strong" arms? Oh no, not me... I've been to too many competitions; My hands are real weak now. Seriously? Yes, but I have a friend who's a locksmith. I'm sure he can help you. Thanks. My stomach hurts again. Excuse me, where's the washroom? Right down here on your right... please. Thank you. You're really so kind. I'll wait here. I'll be back soon. Please come back, I love you so! I'm using the toilet, close the door! - Come inside! - No way! - Where's your decency? - Over my dead body! No way! - Come inside! - No way! Where's your decency? Who asked you to use this toilet? It stinks! Why would I lock myself in there? No way! Number one or number two? One. Then hurry! I'm trying! Stop yelling! I need to focus, okay? It stinks like... - That scorpion really... - You're doing a number two? It was a number one at first. But I can't control it... Where are you going? Shut the door! It's that scorpion you ate! Shut the door, there are people! Don't worry, I'll keep watch. Come inside! It doesn't stink. - I'll be quick. - No! Let go... Help me, oppa! Oppa! Did you send someone to our room to check? But nobody's there? Did you find your friend yet? No. Don't worry, she'll be fine. Have a seat, come on. Soda? Excuse me. Can you please open mine? My hands are so weak. I know it looks crazy, but please help me. Please. Okay, sure. Thank you. Hey, listen. My customers left me a ton of shoes back there. Why don't you and your friends go pick out some stuff? Okay. By the way, what kind of shoes does Jialan like? Jialan? She always wears high-heels. Me too. Well, for girls only, I love high-heels. Girls look sexier in high-heels. You're funny. What does she do in her free time? She loves Korean dramas. Do you know "Descendants of the Sun"? She watched it four times. I watched it five times. Five. That's a nice tattoo. Do you have a Vietnamese fiancé? Vietnamese? So this is a Vietnamese guy's name? That's what it looks like. Well, is there a problem? Even though my Vietnamese isn't very good, but it appears like Vietnamese. Are you sure? Is there a problem? It is really... Vietnamese. I just feel sad. I think I did something wrong last night... Do you have a beer? What exactly did you eat? What did you eat yesterday that stinks so bad? Fried eggs, steamed eggs, bitter melons... steak, oranges, durian... You ate so much! So what? Unity! Captain Dragon reporting. Come with me to my car. I'll take you to my friend. Perfect. Boss. We did a thorough search of the mansion, but couldn't find the ruby ring. Also, the safe was cracked open. Bullshit! Idiots! Tell Tran Ha to bring those women back here. Yes, sir. Fuck! Who are those guys? Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad people! Do you know these people? They must have discovered the ruby ring missing. Break their window! You stole from them. Why would I steal? Hold on! Get them, hurry! What should we do now? Let's run! Okay. Hurry! Go, go, go! How much is this fruit? Go away, go away. I want to buy fruit, how much? Free, they're free. Everyone, this fruit is free! Come on over... Go away! Go away! Get them! Let's go! Don't be afraid, I'll take them down. Oppa! So handsome. Fighting! - Let's go there! - Oppa! Move over! He's taking them all on, so cool! Oppa! It's on! It's on! Oppa, we're going to get you! Get on the boat! Oppa! Get on the boat! Get him! I got this. Go. Go faster! Got it. Your boobs are bigger than mine. I get mad whenever I see your boobs! Go to hell! Get your ass over there! Stop! Stop! Danger! Speed up! Here. Bye-bye... The train station is over there. The enemy won't be here anytime soon. Get on the train. It goes around the whole country. Go as far as you can. What about you? I'll stay. If they come... I'll try to stop them. Dragon oppa. You're a brave man. Okay. We should go. Dragon I'll just give you guys 3 more minutes. You can pretend I'm not around, okay? Hey, sweetie. I almost forgot. Any chance I can have your WeChat number? Xiwen. I'm exhausted. 1, 2, 3! It's so heavy. Dragon ...so in love. Some people have such strange taste. Who? I wonder who has stranger taste? Someone who slept with Bao Son and even lost his ruby ring. Isn't that why we're running for our lives? I'm sorry. One, I didn't sleep with Bao Son. Two, I told you a million times. It was an accident. Are you deaf? You're so accident-prone, shouldn't you get insurance? You listen carefully... The phone... Maybe it's Jinjin? - Who is it? - Is it Jinjin? Hello? The code to unlock the box is 5240. The key for the handcuffs is inside. If you spend everything in the box within 24 hours, they'll stop chasing you. Remember, never give up the box to the people chasing you. Otherwise there will be consequences. Did you give us the box? - Who are you? - It's none of your business. Someone who can help you or destroy you. What about Jinjin? Is she with you? Of course she's with me. She's safe. Can we see her? Just spend everything in the box within the next 24 hours, then you can see her. Remember, you only have 24 hours. Hello? Have we been dragged into some big conspiracy? What now? There's no time to be afraid. We have to save Jinjin. Open the box! So much gold! My boyfriend may be rich, but I've never seen so much gold before. Wait... This much gold can only mean trouble. But I'm dying to take all of you home! Who says they're for you? Let's get started. Operation Rescue Jinjin begins! This used car cost us a gold bar! So expensive! Not expensive. Our objective is to spend all the gold. I was willing to pay even more. Look, Saigon Opera House! We finally got to see it! It's gorgeous. The box is still full. Let's just give it away. I'm starving. Can't we eat something first? My turn... Yum! It's a must eat when you're in Vietnam. No! I'm on a diet! Oh please, it's a once-in-a-lifetime trip. Forget your diet, you're fine. This is my third bowl! I'm full, get the check. Boss! Check, please! The check? Keep the change. It's gold. No... I can't... Real... Real... many, many, money. Gold! Cash, cash... No... We have no cash... No! I'm getting married! He wants your earrings! But they're fake. What now? We still have 98 bars left. Are you sure that place sells expensive clothes? Obama shopped there when he came to visit. What now? Is this a bad joke? A gold bar for this junk heap? Look, we're still ten minutes away from the mall. What do we do? Let's walk? Go. Wait! It's a church! So what? There's no time. Churches welcome donations. Let's donate the gold. Hurry... This place is huge! No sightseeing. Find the donation box. - Over there! - Go, go, go... Quick... Bring it all. - I can't... - The opening is too small. - How come they don't go in? - Almost fits... Nevermind. Put the gold in there. It's bigger. Much bigger. Quick! 1, 2, 3! Sorry, sorry... Amitabha... No... hallelujah... Close it. Close it. Wait! Wait! Funeral tributes. Kings were buried with tributes in the past. What are you doing? What are you doing? What's going on? My friend... My friend... I'll miss you. Who is she? Why is she crying? She's so skinny. Must be a cancer patient from the hospital. They must all be terminally ill. My dears... There's no need to be sad. This dear brother is already up in heaven. Yes, heaven! We give him present in heaven. No! No, no present. I'm his best friend... Listen... This dear brother, before he died... he asked only one thing... which is for each of his friends to give him a kiss. A kiss. Good, good... Come... Come give your dear friend a kiss. I'll help you, don't be shy. Are you ready? Yes? Right there, okay? One... Two... Three, right there... Right there... Right there... Oh, my... Take your box... My... There are lots of designer shops even in Vietnam. - Come take a look. - Where should we go? You stink! Really? Let's go in and get you some new clothes. What now? You copy everything I do down to the clothes I wear. Must be exhausting? Puffy... You stuffed your bra. My dear... What are you doing? Did I? Did I stuff? I don't want to touch your breasts. I don't want to touch your nose either, because it might fall off. I was born with a high nasal bridge, look closely. Touch it... I think there's something going on with your friend. Maybe you should go check on her. What's wrong. What have you done? Stop scratching, Your skin is all red! What are you doing? Stop scratching! Your skin will break! You both lied to me! You told me it was a tiny tattoo... But it's huge! Even worse, it's a man's face. What do I do? You can remove it with a laser. Qiaoli won't notice. We won't tell. I'm sorry, Vietnam was such a bad idea. But... you must know... it's not your fault. It was an accident. Please forgive us? It was an accident. Please forgive me. Qiaoli loves me dearly. He treats me so well. I went through a lot before I finally found him. How could I ruin everything like this? Kimmy. Where's your phone? Let me borrow it. What for? I want to call Qiaoli to tell him that the wedding is off. No! Listen to me. He truly loves you. This is nothing. No one will ever know, we won't tell. But what am I going to do about the tattoo? It makes me feel dirty. You're not dirty. You're not dirty, silly. I have an idea. What is it? You didn't do anything wrong. I don't know that. Hold still. What are you doing? From now on, whenever you see this tattoo, all you'll see is the two of us... and you. What? All three of us are gluttons. It's ugly! Do you even know how to draw? I do. You like it? I hate it even more. Thank you so much. Pretty, pretty. Gold bar! Keep the change for yourself. I'm sorry, we only take cash or credit card. It's not enough? Take everything out. Wait a second... Sorry, this is our rule. I beg you... We have to spend all of this within 24 hours or we all die. Okay, at least please tell me... where in Vietnam can we spend gold? Let me ask for you, okay? Ask everybody you know... Please! Idiot... how can she refuse gold? Hello. You guys want to use up that gold? Yes! I know a special boat that you can buy with gold. You can go there and check. Really? - We can use this to buy this? - Yes. Thank you! Buy a boat! Hope I can help you, good luck! - Bye-bye. - Bye. - You want to keep one? - No. We're saved! Let's go! Go buy a boat! What a beautiful yacht! Are we going to own a yacht? - Yes! - Yacht-owners! The yacht was christened Elisa. After today... after I buy it, we'll christen it Kimmy! This is a special boat. The name Kimmy sounds so boring. Then call it Kim-Jia-Wen. It's not bad... but the décor is not to my taste. Nevermind. I can redo it later. The yacht's not yours. I used to dream of buying cars or houses. I never imagined being able to buy a yacht! This yacht is huge! How can we take it home? I've been waiting for you. Why is she here? What's happening? We stepped into a trap! I've got no time. If you give me the ruby ring and the gold bars now, I'll kill you quickly. We can't give her the gold. Never. Run! Let her go! Throw these. Screw you! Let's go! Jialan, watch out. Kimmy! Are you okay? Let's go! Go! This way. Go after them! What now? Go up there, use the zip-line! What are you doing? We took a Wilderness Survival class. We know how to do this! But I didn't take the class! - Xiwen. - Take the box with you. Give us a push! Push me back! I'll save you! Jialan! Hang onto me. 1... 2... 3! Come! What do we do? Kick him! Careful... Go, hurry. It's a dead-end. We're dead. What now? Wilderness Survival: Jump into the sea! 1... 2... Quick, grab her! Don't move! Police! Don't move! Come down! Police! Come down! Come in. Sit over there. I'm scared. What do we do? Are we... Are we going to jail? Nevermind. Your boyfriend is rich. Tell him to come save us. Are you crazy? If his mother finds out, she'll never let me marry him! What am I to do? I'll never get married. Look. No way... Are my brows that droopy? Those eyes are huge. No one in this world has eyes as big as yours. Right? Kimmy... Are we wanted by the police? We just arrived yesterday... but already broke the law? Let's get out first. - Let's get out. - Okay. What is this? Hello, I'm the Station Sergeant. Thanks for your help last night capturing the most wanted criminal. We've been searching for this man for a long time. Thanks to you, he was finally brought to justice. We came to express our gratitude in person. We helped capture the most wanted man? That's right. After you subdued the criminal last night, you left the scene so quickly, we didn't get a chance to thank you. What's going on? Would you please tell us where we were last night? Sure. It's such a fun place. I'm sure you will want to visit again. So we went to a male brothel last night. Nooo...? You must be the one who took us here. Probably. Do you think my tattoo is one of them? That's not so bad. At least they're well built. If I were... It's alright. Kimmy and I will go in. You just wait here. I'm going in. I want to see what he looks like in person! Get up! Those women are back! Get up! Hurry! They're back! Get up! The cops must have beaten them up. Who says it was the cops? It was you, you three! No way... I am going up, come! Everyone, freeze! Don't move or I'll shoot! Don't move! This toy gun looks so real! Come over here. Come. The cops are here! Run! Let's go. Can you give us this tape? We'll pay whatever you want. Please. No wonder you guys got beaten so badly. I'm so sorry! You're the wildest clients we've ever had, and also the biggest spenders. Please visit us again. Just give us some time to heal. What a shame! I've been here before but don't remember any of it. What a waste. Excuse me, I wonder... Does this tattoo ring a bell? Was it you? You? You? Nevermind... It was me! I was too rough last night. You kept screaming. Are you still hurting today? Look at me. So it was you with the big head? Exactly how drunk was I? Oh my god... My god... There's a traffic jam. The hospital is two blocks away. Get out of my way. I'll take her. Take it! Take it! Let me... You scared me! You scared me! So? What did the doctor say? What did the doctor say? I don't know, he hasn't come out yet. Let's just wait. How's your arm? - It's fine. - What's wrong? I just got 30 stitches. The doctor said. I 'D have a scar this big! Oh no... - I'm so sorry. - Nevermind. I didn't know... Don't worry. Because I was just kidding. It still hurts, Miss. Be careful. The doctor said it's just a flesh wound. No need to worry about me. Thank you. You're welcome. You saved me too, so... we're even. Why are you talking like this? I'm not used to it. I'm not either... I'm not scared. Me neither. Who hugged me so tightly? What is it? My stomach is hurting again. You need to go to the loo? I want to. I'll go with you. Hurry... Can you please hurry? What's wrong? Will you go in with me? No, please. We're not chained together. Don't worry. I'll wait for you here. I'll be here. Then keep talking to me. You keep talking too. Keep answering, keep talking. - Keep talking... - Keep talking... Be quick. I know. Hey! You're not talking. It's hard to make conversation in a washroom. Why don't you try? Did you and your boyfriend have a fight? What did you say? You didn't ask for my phone to call him all day. When you were in the strip club, you whipped the men so ruthlessly. It's not the Jailan I know. I found it all a little strange. - Really? - Yes. Actually... I envy you, you have a boyfriend who loves you. You envy me? Yes. You do what you want every day... You don't need to work, just go shopping. It's great, don't you think? I not only get to shop, I also get to stay at the best hotels in foreign countries, even presidential suites. But... I wake up alone every morning in a king-sized bed. Because my boyfriend is off somewhere sleeping with other girls. Why don't you leave him? I've known many men. It doesn't matter how rich they are. What matters is finding a man who truly loves you. You're already quite perfect. If my score is 100 points. Yours is at least a 99. I'm worse than you? Not much worse; I give you a 99.5. Are you okay? Lend me your phone. It's me. I'm fed up. Let's break up. You did it? Cool! Can I use your phone again? Sure, but why? I um... kind of miss Dragon. So soon? Women are so fickle! - Xiwen. - Feeling better? What's wrong? Xiwen, what is it? Three months. Three... months. To live? No! I'm three months pregnant! That's wonderful! That's great! Stop crying. We're so happy! I've failed Qiaoli. I've failed our baby. I don't deserve to be a mother. - I don't... - It's okay. It's Qiaoli. I must tell him! I must confess! No... Cut it out! You can't confess to him! Let's lie to him! Let's say... we're at a... spa! Hello! What took you so long to answer? We're getting a massage; It feels good! Just the three of you? - Where's Jinjin? - She's here. She's here. Let me see her. Sure. Hold on. We have to send the masseuses out. Hold on, baby... Hi, baby. Hi, did you have fun? Yes, we had loads of fun. Where's Jinjin? Jinjin is over there. Qiaoli, long time no see. What's wrong with Jinjin? She put on a face mask and she fell asleep. Don't wake her. Is she eating well? She hates Vietnamese food. So I scolded her on your behalf, I said... Jinjin, you don't eat, you're a bad girl. Jinjin, no good... But she ignored me! Her skin seems darker. Have you ever been to Vietnam? Look, we're tanned too! So pretty! Ask her what she wants to eat. When you return, I'll cook for you girls. Okay. Xiwen? Hi baby, what is it? Baby, are you alright? We'll see each other soon. Make the most out of your last trip as a single girl. I miss you so... Silly, we'll see each other soon. The masseuses are back. We have to go; Massages are expensive. Alright, be safe. - Bye-bye! - Bye. I've never felt so bad in my entire life. You feel bad because you truly love Qiaoli. And the two of us love you! You must not give up. If only one of us gets to leave Vietnam today, it will be you, don't worry. Xiaomei is calling. Xiaomei! Hello! What did you do to Bao Son last night? His men asked me if I knew where you were. Xiaomei, we screwed up. Come save us. Let's talk in person. I'm on location at the casino. Come over here. I'll text you the address. - Okay. - All right, bye. Casino... We're saved! Why? What kind of gambler are you? You always lose! Let's take her to the casino. She'll lose all the gold in no time. Losing money... I can do that with confidence. I'll call Uber. I would never have thought you could impersonate Xiamei so well. Now we just wait for them to come. I've set up a net to trap them. They won't escape this time. More... I'm so unlucky. I love gambling. Not zero, not zero... Blackjack, miss, you win again. Why is this happening? Where's my bad luck when I need it? Does getting pregnant make you lucky? Miss, we wish to invite you to play in the VIP room. What did you say? I don't understand. What do you mean? What are you doing? What's going on? The God of Gamblers? The Vietnamese God of Gamblers? I've seen all your movies, can I take a picture with you? No pictures. We're competitors now. Maybe being pregnant gives me cravings. Can I have some? Just... one piece? Let's play Show Hand. Show Hand? How do you play? Do you just show all your cards? My hidden card is 3, what's yours? You think I trust you? All... all in. All in. My hidden card is 3 and my high card is 8. You win! Mission accomplished! Not so fast. I have two Aces, you have three 3s. You win. Boss, I'm sorry. I've failed you. What's going on? Xiwen... Xiwen, are you alright? I'm fine, why are you here? Who are they? - Were you kidnapped? - No. I came to lose money. To lose money? What's happening? You have some balls. Bao Son? You stole my ruby ring and gold. Do you have no concept of "death"? I lost your ring. But I didn't steal your gold bars. A woman contacted us. She told us to spend all the gold in a day. She was holding our friend hostage. What a ridiculous explanation! You think I believe you? I have proof. My phone has a recording function, and I recorded our conversation. - What's going on? - I don't know. Listen for yourself. If you spend everything in the box within 24 hours, they'll stop chasing you. I knew it was you! This dart is so fat. It can't be anyone else... It must be you! Maria. Come out! Come out! Get her! Let go! Let go! Drop the net! Hands off! Don't hurt her. It really is you! I miss you. Maria I'll never let you go again. Weird. Maria is the Boss's ex-wife. They divorced years ago, but the Boss never got over her. It's been a long time. You've lost a lot of weight. I'm not the only one who thinks you're a monster! I can turn a blind eye to your affairs. But how could you sing "our song" with her? And give her our love token? You want to kill me? No... Your bad. I sang with her because I was pretending that she was you. Her hands were slender like yours. That's why I couldn't resist. Where's the resemblance? Maybe in the face? Were you motivated by jealousy to steal my gold and frame them? You made me so mad. I had to make you kill them. I stole your gold and gave it to them. I wanted them to spend it all to hurt you! Maria... I did you wrong... But you disappeared for all these years. I couldn't find you. I missed you. Can you sing with me again? "I once told you this would be a wordless ending" "that would fade away with time." "I once said that if I were to leave you one day" "there would be no tears on my face." Well... That's so corny. It's time to go. Wait. Jinjin. There, Jinjin is in my car. Jinjin! Jinjin... Here... We can go home now. Jinjin, my baby. Do you miss Mommy already? This is Jinjin? That's her, Jinjin. She's Jinjin? What about our Jinjin? Your dog is named Jinjin too? What a coincidence! Xiwen... Hit harder... harder. Harder! Xiwen! Xiwen! Don't worry. We'll find her. If we don't find her alive her corpse will turn up. Her corpse? Is she dead? Jinjin... She'll be fine... That's right. She's definitely alive. With Bao Son's power and influence, as long as she's in Vietnam, we'll find her. She should be fine... Unless... she was sold as a sex slave to the Middle East. Maria, we thank you. Can't you change the subject? What a lovely tattoo! Where did you get it? Why did you drag me here? Qiaoli? Qiaoli? What Qiaoli? Isn't that a Chinese name? Qiaoli? Qiaoli? This is "Qiaoli"...? So it is not the name of that big head guy? Big Head is a renowned tattooist in Vietnam. That means you and Big Head didn't sleep together. Of course not. Everyone in Vietnam knows that Big Head is gay. That's wonderful! Thank goodness... You only have one dad! Good baby... - What's wrong? - What's gong on? Are you pregnant too? I'm not pregnant. My stomach hurts. I need to go. I can't. One more try. One more time... I've finally found you! Hurray! Bao Son! I've found it! Help! I've found it! Where are you? I'm starving to death! Jinjin! Cheers. Cheers! Welcome back! Jinjin, so you were trapped in there since last night? You worried us to death! Wasn't there a magic show last evening? I haven't called your brother yet. I'll make the call outside, it's too noisy. I'll get some juice to calm my nerves. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to tonight's magic show. For my next trick, I'm going to need a volunteer from the audience. How about... the lady with the blender here? Excuse me, Madam... Everybody, a round of applause! Come here, it's all right! It's okay, I'll take your blender. It's okay... Don't worry, it's okay. I'll just put this over you for a minute here. Don't worry. Are you okay in there? Are you okay? Okay. She's okay everybody. Now... Here we go. What is this place? How do I open this? Help! Help! Hey, hey. Girls. Jinjin was returned safely. Bao Son and I patched things up. What matters most is my ruby ring also turned up. What a lucky day for us! If I were you, I wouldn't have returned the ring. If you knew where I found the ring, you definitely would have returned it to them. That shouldn't go there. Look at these... Your daughter isn't here yet! What's going on? She's not? Give her a call. This child... Exactly, this child! Let me check for you. Don't drink it all, give me that. - Hello? - Hello? Xiwen, where are you? - Why aren't you here yet? - Dad... Wait by the pool, I'll be there shortly. Girls. Are you ready? Not ready! Don't be scared. Let's do it! Go! 1... 2... 3! I never imagined my last trip as a single girl would be so thrilling. What's more surprising is that the brash and carefree Kimmy, and the posh and proud Jialan ended their feud with laughter and became best friends. A perfect conclusion to our Vietnam trip. When we go crazy and scream together it feels like there's nothing we can't do. When I'm an old lady, I still want to do my nails and gossip with you girls. Let's stick together through marriage, children, and no matter what happens in the future. As long as we hold onto each other's hands, we'll never be alone. "Let's grow old together traveling through time." "Never fall apart even when the rainbow ends" "I was lucky to find you in the ever-changing world." "We'll always have each other" "as we grow old together." What have you done? Are you crazy? It was dangerous! You're getting married, but still act like a child? You two are no better! Don't be mad. We took safety precautions. It was very safe! Besides, we promised to fulfill your daughter's wishes before she got married. Don't tell Qiaoli about this or he'll kill me. Has he arrived? He's on his way. The wedding is starting soon. Go fix yourself up. Go, hurry. Go - Go. Wait a minute. Hi! Hi! Hey, how are you doing? I'm good. - Oh man, I'm so happy... Oh man. - Me too. I miss you so much that my heart aches, my love. Oppa. I miss you too! Really? Where are you? I'm at Xiwen's wedding party. Oh really? Look on your left. Oppa! ...in richness or in poorness ...in richness or in poorness for better or for worse... Qiao Li. Do you take Lin Xiwen to be your lawful wedded wife? Yes, I do. Lin Xiwen. Do you take Qiao... wait... I got you... Okay... You can do it. I'm ready... You can do... I do. You may exchange rings now. Didn't you promise to toss it to me? Didn't you promise to toss it to me? "Every time I'm feeling lonely." "You come around and hug me." "Every time I'm feeling crazy." "You come around and calm me" "I think I got to thank you." "For everything you gave me" "I wanna be with you, till the end of days." Hi! Hi, Maria... Cheers. Actually... I can forgive you for handcuffing us together. But why did you have to strip us naked? Are you a pervert? Oh, please. Who wants to see you strip? You're the ones who forced me to strip! After I took you to the beach you wanted to strip for a pre-wedding skinny dip. You kept calling me... Xiaomei... You even kissed my lips! I called you Xiaomei? Where's the resemblance? Exactly. So tell me, did you join us skinny dipping? Tell us... I did! "I was lucky to find you in the ever-changing world." "We'll always have each other" "as we grow old together." Cheers! Don't you recognize me? You took me to the strip club that day. We had a great time! Let's go! Hurry! Stop! So we took the wrong person to the car. Are you done yet? Are you done yet? The same dress? Next time don't shop on the internet. - I don't know any better.. - Exactly. "Standing shoulder to shoulder, laughing at the storm." "No need to spill tears on a single tree." "When we have a forest of sisterhood to play in." "Let's grow old together traveling through time." "Never fall apart even when the rainbow ends" "I was lucky to find you in the ever-changing world." "We'll always have each other" "as we grow old together." "We'll always have each other" "as we grow old together"
