- [Alex] (crying) He's gone and, and I pushed him there. - [George] I was one of the responding officers when his mom was murdered. Grisly scene. When I took that kid outta the car he was 10 degrees colder than he should have been. I felt like I'd been holding someone that'd been dead for hours. Point is, you didn't put him anywhere. He'd been heading that way long before you knew him. - I know. I just shoulda seen this coming. (fist thuds) (Charles groans) (suspenseful music) - [Dave] Nice work, Detective. - [Lee] Get him the fuck inside. I wanna have a little fun. Come on Charles, we just wanna ask you a few questions. (Dave and Lee laughing) (metal creaking) (door bangs) - Backup's on the way. Just in time to be late, as usual. - I love a good countdown. You know what we want. What do you know? (Charles laughing) (Lee laughs) Oh, this is gonna be good. It's a loaded question, I know, so lemme rephrase it. (fist thudding) (Charles groaning) (Lee laughing) Oh yeah! - Lee, Lee. Lee, Lee. Lee, get off of him. - Get off of me! (Charles crying) I'm sorry, where are my manners? (Charles groaning) (Charles yelling) - Fuck! - Tell us or doctor brainfucker here takes a core sample of your entire- - Ah fuck you! - Fucking head. (Lee laughs) (door bangs) - Let him go. He's got no reason to fuck with you. Keep it up and he will. - Oh, I know he won't fuck with me. Either of you will. (ominous music) (dramatic music) - [Radio Announcer 1] Today marks the release of Les Sabo, who many listeners may remember better as The Ghoul. A man who was once both lauded and despised for the brutally violent vigilante tactics he employed in his quest to avenge the murder of his young mother. And while many found his means to be a necessary evil, everyone took notice and turned against The Ghoul after he was convicted of murdering Lee Cross, a detective with the Chicago Police Department. Lee's partner, Dave Simmons, apprehended The Ghoul and locked him away, where sympathy for his vendetta has all but died. Detective Simmons, on the other hand, has gained notoriety for his perceived failure to live up to the precedent set by his father, Detective George Simmons. - [Radio Announcer 2] Can we please talk about this Simmons guy. - [Radio Announcer 3] Being paid money he doesn't deserve, and why- - [Radio Announcer 4] Drinking (beep) vodka all- - [Radio Announcer 5] Nothing short of a complete disaster- - [Radio Announcer 6] Get rid of him! - [Radio Announcer 1] Being released botched indictments. (Dave coughing) (Dave coughing) - This should have been done years ago! How the fuck can you expect me to back off this piece of shit? - Turn that fuckin' van around, right fuckin' now, and stay the fuck away from him! - This motherfucker dies, today. - Get your ass back home. I already have this taken care of. - Sorry pops, it's not gonna happen. - This isn't some ordinary piece of shit! - (laughs) That's right, that's right, he's The Ghoul! He's a skin eating boogeyman! Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm looking right at the motherfucker, and he looks like an ordinary piece of shit to me. I gotta go. - Stupid fuckin' boy! (van engine roaring) (car engine roaring) - Those are for werewolves. (Mario laughs) (gun bangs) (tires screeching) (Les groans) - Remember kids, werewolf or ghoul, silver bullets will still fuck you up. Let's get a good look at this asshole for everyone to see. Goddamn that's a big fuckin' hole! I know you can't see it, but trust me, it's bad. I don't see what the big deal is with this asshole. (Van Goon screaming) - Motherfucker! - How's that feel? How's that feel? Not so fuckin' tough now are you? (Les groans) Pull this fuckin' van over! (crows cawing) - Please don't eat my skin! - This is how I see it, I'm going that way, you're going that way. Your boss is a fucking dead man. (crows cawing) Now beat it. - Yeah. (gun bangs) - Fuck!

That's how you're gonna get him. Keep it up. Brilliant detective work, really. You know what I would have done? Of course not. I'd have waited for him outside the prison this morning. Fish in a barrel! Even you couldn't have fucked that up! - Goddammit! Then why the fuck didn't you? Just send one of your old cop buddies to kill this piece of shit if it's so fucking easy! - Now you're gettin' it. (phone ringing) - Hey Coop, how's it going? - [Cooper] Fuckin' peachy. Listen, I just got a call about a van full of corpses outside of Joliet. - The Ghoul? - [Cooper] (chuckles) No, probably one of the other murderers that got out today. Dave. - [Dave] Right, I'm on my way. (door bangs) (ominous rock music) (door bangs) (police radio chattering) (police siren wailing) - [Radio Announcer 8] Force, that one of the victims in this brutal work van massacre is none other than Mario Colosimo, son of the alleged boss of the Chicago Outfit, Kenna Colosimo. The Old Man, as he has come to be known, has not been reachable for comment, and his silence has only added more fuel. - [Dave] Hey Coop. How's it goin'? Well, looks like out friend's been busy. - He was definitely here. Left behind four bodies, two shivs, one pistol, and a trail of his own blood a half mile long. No footprints though. Fuckin' weird. - Any witnesses? - (chuckles) Not anymore. We know from the blood that Les exited the vehicle through the passenger side door and walked north. But the spatter on the driver's side door tells us the driver was shot from there. And before these swingin' dicks trampled all over the fuckin' scene, there was a set of footprints that led up to the van, then back about four yards to a separate set of tire tracks. My point is, Les let this man go. Someone else killed him after the fact and took off in a hurry. - Uh, well, I mean, couldn't, couldn't those be from, I, I don't know, whoever called this in? - [Cooper] It's possible, but the wound this man sustained appears to have come from a higher caliber weapon than that bloody Single Action Army. - Okay, well let's just say there was another person, uh, any leads on their identity or motive? - No, nothin'. - What, what a waste. Hey, it's always good to see ya. Um, if you think of anything else, give me call. - [Cooper] Well, there is one other thing. The shivs. - What about 'em? - I doubt he walked out of prison with them, and I doubt they belonged to these corpses, they all had guns. Someone must have left them for him outside of the prison. - Fuck, I think I know who that is. - [Cooper] Who? - Ah, it's just a hunch. Um, it's personal, I'll take care of it. - Fair enough. I've got a new hunch of my own. - I met Les when we were kids. I was living with my dad in some dump, just watching him drink himself to death. Les was like 17, he had a whole family of runaways that he looked after. The street kids worshiped him. (door pounding) (door knocking) (somber rock music) Oh, we're gonna have to talk about this thing. You're bleeding all over the place. Aren't you going to say anything? - Hi. - Hi. - Baby, you just slammed my head into the floor. Shit's still kinda hazy. - You don't suppose this giant bullet hole in your chest has anything to do with it? - [Les] No, (laughs). No, it looks way worse than it is. - Oh, God. Let's get you up. - I missed you. - I missed you, too.

I can see it quite vividly, though I haven't the slightest idea of what it's for. A key without a lock. (Jo Jo laughs) I'm just the ferryman. - [Les] What the fuck just happened? - [Jo Jo] We've come to the bridge. - [Les] Bridge to where? - [Jo Jo] Something tucked away in another plane never meant to be discovered.

(George sighs) (heavy breathing) - [Radio Announcer 1] Must feel about so many taking up the flag of the man he was praised for imprisoning 10 years ago. He has so far been unreachable for comment. Crowds continue to gather in neighborhoods from Rogers Park all the way down to South Shore to show their support for The Ghoul's cause. (door knocking) (Stewart imitates barking) - Les! - [Les] Stewart. - We all missed you. It's been too long. - Don't remind me. - Come on in. Charlie's anxious to see you. (Stewart imitates barking) - Holy shit! The perfect person to cheer an old man up. - What're you, like 23 now? - [Charlie] 23's a long time for a rat. - You smell like shit. - Nah, you're just used to that fancy prison livin'. Swappin' cum rags and bunk fuckin'! But please, allow me to be the first to welcome you back to the gutter! - [Les] I'm not sure I ever left. - It's good to see you, man. - I need you to look after Alex for me. - Sis, are you fucking kidding me? She can look after herself, I'm afraid of her. - This is different. I'm ending this tonight. - Tell you what. Give her this number, call it. It's a cop. (laughs) Don't worry about it, I got this dick by the balls. - She'll be safe here. - No she fuckin' won't, because you and I are about to stir up some serious shit, and the first fuckin' place they're gonna look is here. Now, you wanna get this fuckhead back? The one that killed your mother? Stole your soul? This, is the perfect opportunity to lure him out. Hit him hard. I know these two women, Cindy, Debbie. Great friends, but even better dominatrixes! They're known for being the best, and they keep an exclusive clientele, and you could not imagine who is there. - Get to the point. And don't insult my imagination. - Okay, okay, okay, okay, his name is Lou Manalti. - Lou the Jew. (Lou burps) - The Old Man's number two. - No shit. - [Charles] I thought you might like that. And that, is where you come in. - Won't he have a lookout? - Yes, just one guy, stays outside. (Bodyguard screaming) And then that's where you come in. You get to deliver that message, courtesy of that beautiful imagination I know you so highly regard. It's perfect. - [Lou] Come on, I just, I was just havin' fun with the girls. Let me go. Come on, what're you doing man? We don't want to mess around man, I'm just a guy with some girls who are having a little lunch. We don't want to mess around. No, no, no, no, no! - Swallow.

That's a good girl. (Tammy grunting) - Can you imagine having 25 years of scabbed up knife wounds and bullets holes ripped off all at once. It's kind of funny. Les came out on top no matter what. But he always, he always got like shot, or stabbed, or sliced, or something, every fucking time. - [Radio Announcer 1] Details of the vicious murder of Lou Manalti, a man with close connections to the Colosimo family. - Holy fuck, you scared the shit out of me! Does this mean its over? - No, I need you to get outta here. - [Radio Announcer 1] Psychopathic level of violence displayed in this latest crime, support for The Ghoul continues. (Tammy grunting) - Take this number, his name's Dave, he's a cop. - Why not Charles? - Baby, I pissed some people off. Charles is involved. Call Dave, he'll get you somewhere safe, but I need you to just get dressed, all right? - [Doctor] Shh, quiet, Tammy, quiet.

Hello. Who the fuck are you? - Dave, Detective Dave Simmons. Your brother told me to come here. I guess now I know why. - We gotta get the fuck out of here, where's your car? - It's over there. Whoa, Charles told me to help Les. - You're not much of a fucking cop, are you? - I'm not a cop, honey, I'm a dick. - Yeah, no shit. - You know what, I've got better things to do than babysit some asshole's whore sister. (fist thuds) (Dave groans) - Let's get one thing straight, I will wreck your ass, every fucking time. - [Police Dispatcher] All available units, report to 1348 West Fullerton Avenue. Reported sighting of the criminal known as The Ghoul. - [Radio Announcer 1] Not bode well for anyone involved in this brawl, including The Ghoul, who eyewitnesses have placed at the scene. If reports coming in- - Stay here. - [Radio Announcer 1] Are to be believed, the crowds may not have a cause to rally behind. - What's the word? - Well, we got a corpse upstairs burnt to shit, and according to these two guys, a ghost did it. - Kinda reminds you of fatback, doesn't it? - So what, what's your theory? What do you think happened? - Too hungry to really care, actually. Besides, aren't theories your job Detective? (energetic electronic music) (light whooshes) (door rumbling) (door thuds) - [Dave] Appears your boyfriend was taken by ghosts. - What? - Fuck, I don't know! There was a sheet of skin up there. Pieces of skin, sewn together. Look, I'll take you somewhere safe. You've gotta get me caught up on the way. (suspenseful music) (car engine roaring) - He told us that he was searching for his soul. Man, we hung onto his words like gospel. It brought us together, gave us purpose. And that was something that none of us had ever experienced. We needed him. - So you knew he was killing people all over the city and you still think he's a fuckin' saint? - My dad killed himself rather than take care of me, and Les, he took me in with no question. He provided for me. - Provided for you? What the fuck did he provide for you by killing my partner? - That's who you fuckin' are! Your partner nearly beat my brother to death! - Your brother was withholding information on a crime family we'd been investigating for months! Lee was interrogating him! - Bullshit! - Now look, you're both acting like fuckin' assholes! Now sit the fuck down and let's finish talking! Now tell her your side of the story, tell her what you saw. - Why? - Because maybe you can settle something like a reasonable person for once. - Fine. We were chasing your asshole brother through Humboldt Park. (Lee laughing) (rock music) - You fuck! Fuck! - [Lee] Tell us or doctor brainfucker here takes a core sample of your entire- - Fuck you! - Fucking head. (Charlie crying) (Lee laughing) (door bangs) - [Les] Let him go. He's got no reason to fuck with you. Keep it up and he will. - Oh, I know he won't fuck with me. Neither of you will. (lights click) (ominous music) (dramatic rock music) (skin crackling) (police sirens wailing) - So you didn't actually see anything. - I saw enough. Besides, who else could of done it? - I don't know, maybe the same fuckin' people that fried that guy tonight! - You mean person, as in Les. - Oh, let me ask you something detective, if Les could fry anybody attacking him, why the fuck would he wait until after his skin had been ripped off to do it? - She's got you there. - Except for the fact that this doesn't make any fucking sense! - None of it does! We need to be out there trying to find what's left of him. - You're right. Why am I sitting here listening to your bullshit when Les is the one I'm after? I'm going to Wrigleyville. - The hotdog joint? - Your brother told me to hang out there. You got a better lead? - Coop came by earlier. He was asking some strange questions. - What kind of questions? - He was asking if your gun was around, and he was lookin' at your shoes on the way out. Son, if Coop thinks you're into something, you better straighten it out. Friend or not, he'll nail your ass to the wall. - Son? - Look, just don't be a hero. I mean this in the best possible way, you're not. (foreboding music) - My faithful. You have fought alongside me and for me in order to see this day. (staff thuds) The end of our struggle against nothing. The end of our bondage to the unseen. One final sacrifice stands watch over our prison. Our fate is his burden. His burden, our liberation. (brooding piano music) - [Radio Announcer 1] Crowded into parks and bars all over the city await word of The Ghoul's resurgence. Nothing has been seen or heard of him since his mysterious disappearance from the Liar's Club. And while this outcome. - Spot me some cash. - [Dave] ATM's across the street. - How the fuck are you gonna pay? Fucking dick. - Fuck! (rock music) What, are you following me around or something? - You're an easy man to find, Simmons. I smelled the whiskey on your breath the whole way here. Come here, I gotta talk to you. - The fuck are you doing man? Let go of me! - Shut the fuck up already! I know you killed the driver of that van. - Are you fucking serious? - You're goddamn right I'm serious, and I'm the only one amongst us with a fuckin' gun. Where's yours, Detective?
