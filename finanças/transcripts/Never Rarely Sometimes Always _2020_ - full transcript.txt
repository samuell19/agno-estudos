You're not eating anything. I told you I wasn't feeling well. Tell her how great she was. It's kind of hard to compliment someone who's always in a foul mood. It's a phase. Keep telling yourself that. You were really good. - Mm. - Tell her. Your mother wants me to tell you how great you are. Eat shit. Can I have one? What do you want today? - Braid. - Braid? You got it. Let's get your shirt on. Up, up. Are you feeling any better? Not really. Do you want me to call Dr. Pat? No. It's in her head. She needs to get her head checked. All right, come on. Jacket on. - Let's go, let's go. - Where's my arm? Well, good morning. - Morning. - How can I help you? Um, I wanted to know if I could possibly take a test. That's what we do. That's what we're here for. Uh, why don't you sign in, take off your coat, and have a seat. Okay. Yep. - Hello? - Hi. Uh, we've got a girl out here for a test. Okay. Autumn? You ready? Come on in and make yourself at home. You can just sit here, and... and, uh, we'll talk for a bit. What brings you here today? I just haven't been feeling that well lately. I'm sorry to hear that. How long has that been going on? A while. And when was your last period? I don't know exactly. I'm kind of irregular. How old are you? Um, 17. Does mom know you're here? Uh, no. She's working. Oh, I understand. Uh, well, today, we're going to be doing a self-administered test. But I want to let you know something. Even if it's negative, it could still be positive. What does that mean exactly? Well, I mean, if it's negative, you might want to redo the test in a few weeks if you're still concerned. Okay. So, just dip it in here. Is that a test from the supermarket? Yes. I told you it was a self-administered test. That looks like a positive. Um, if it's positive, is there any way it could be negative? No. A positive is always a positive. Have a great day. Hi. How are you? - Just these? Card? - Yeah. - Hello. - Hey. - How are you doing today? - Okay. It looks suspiciously like you are throwing a party. Um, hey, you inviting yourself? No, no, no, just an observation. - What, don't you like to party? - Uh, no. Sorry. That's not what I meant. Well, what time do you get off work? Late. How about if I give you the address if you change your mind? Ten, 20, 30... - 40, 50, 60... - Wait, not at the same time. - You'll mess me up. - Sorry. I saw you weren't at school today. I went to the doctor. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What's wrong? Girl problems. Bad cramps? Yeah. I get those, too. Pretty much burn through a bottle of painkillers, like, every month. Yeah, same. Don't you ever just wish you were a dude? All the time. I like that thing. Oh, thanks. Hey. Hey. Sweetie. Hey. Hi. At least someone in this house loves me. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. That's a girl. Who's a good girl, hmm? Yeah, you like that. You little slut. - Who's a little slut? - Stop. What? She likes it. That's a girl. Look how easy she is. Okay. This is your beautiful baby. You are about ten weeks along. Hard to say precisely, but... everything looks pretty normal. And this... is the most magical sound you will ever hear. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I know this is a lot to take in, but I'm sure once you have that beautiful baby in your arms, you'll forget you ever had any doubts. I know these things. I'm a mother. I just can't imagine that for myself. Well... there are many wonderful people who want children and can't have them. We can connect you to an adoption agency. I just don't know what I want to do right now. Are you abortion-minded? Is that a possibility? Do you have a minute? Could I show you something? The video you are about to see unmasks the terrible truth that abortion is an act of violence which kills a baby. Some of the children we'll show you represent typical nine- and ten-week abortions. Because abortions are never committed prior to the sixth week of pregnancy, every child abortion kills is already so fully formed that her heart's beating and her brain's producing brain wave activity. Many of the babies you'll see, however, range in age through the second and third trimesters of pregnancy... Here. I'll put this in the bag for you, if that's okay. Hey. Are you okay? Should I call your mom? No, I'm okay now. Are you sure? Yeah. What did the doctor say? They couldn't really help me. Why not? I took a test. Wh-What test? - Excuse me. - What is it? Uh, my cousin isn't feeling well. What's wrong with her? She has a stomach bug. Okay. I think I need to take her home. Well, she's on the schedule for two more hours. Can't she wait? She can't. It's really just a few more hours. I'd get lonely if you left. I'll be fine. There you go. Hello? Hi. It's Beth calling from Ellensboro Women's Clinic. Uh, hi. Uh, I'd love to sit with you more and talk. Okay. I'm wondering if you can come back in later today. Um, no, I'm really busy. Of course. Well, how about tomorrow? Can I call you back? - Now's not a really good time. - Uh, no problem. Or I-I could try you again in a little while. - Either way. - Yeah, yeah, okay. Bye. I think we have to switch here. Why? I don't know why. We just do. Hey. Hey, excuse me. Do you know what time this bus gets in? I don't know, like 2:00 p.m. That's what I thought, actually. Cool. You going to New York? Yeah. Freaking love New York. It's kind of my favorite city. Yeah, us, too. Philly's cool and all... you know, it's definitely got history... but New York, like, I think because of the way the city's s-set up and everything, you're forced to interact with people who are just nothing like you. Kind of like this bus. That's funny. What are you doing there? Seeing family and stuff. Well, I mean, I know you'll be pretty busy and all, but, um... by any chance, do you girls like live music? Uh, we're probably gonna be, um, pretty busy. Yeah. Yeah, I get it. Sorry. Well, if you give me your number, I'll text you the info. Maybe you'll change your mind. Here you go. Just texted you. Oh, got it. You girls know where you're going? - What? - Do you know where you're going? Oh, yeah, yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. Okay. I'll text you. Uh, hi. Excuse me. Hey, how you doing? Can you tell me how to get to 44 Court Street? Yeah, take the A or C downtown. Get off at Jay. Uh, how do you get... how do you get to the subway from here? Subway? Just go directly that way. Go downstairs. Have a nice day. Thanks. I.D.s, please, ladies. - Hi. - Hi. So, we're gonna get you all signed in. Um, you're gonna sign your name over here. All right, and then your date of birth. And then today's date. - And then your signature. - Okay. Let me know if you have any questions, - and we'll call you when we're ready. - Yeah. Okay. I just want to review some information, and then we'll get you all set up. Okay? Uh, can you start by verifying your name and date of birth, please? Um, Autumn Callahan. August 19, 2002. Okay. And in addition to the pregnancy test and the sonogram, we also like to have you tested for STDs. Is that okay? Yeah, that's fine, um, but I did already take a pregnancy test, and I did a sonogram. Okay. All right, I understand. Um, but we always have to go by the one that we get today here in our office, with our technician and on our equipment. Is that still okay? - Okay. - Okay. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just tired. Mm. Well, the sonogram is showing that you are about 18 weeks. Does that sound about as far along as you thought? Uh, no, um... the place I went to before said that I was ten weeks. Well, there can be some margin of error, but it's usually in the three-to four-day range. Which is why it's always important for us to do them again. Um, no, the-the sonogram I did before, they definitely said I was ten weeks. Where was that? Back in my town. I have a feeling that that was inaccurate. At this specific facility, in-clinic abortions are offered up to 12 weeks after the start date of your last menstrual period. Then what am I supposed to do? I'm going to send you to our Manhattan facility, and they should be able to take you first thing tomorrow. Uh, can't you call and see if they'll take me now? By the time you get there, they're gonna be closed. I really can't wait until then. I just don't think it's gonna be possible. But they are going to be able to give you the care that you need tomorrow. It's gonna be okay. Look at this. Who's that? You know. It's that guy. Don't encourage him. I'm not. He seriously texted me three times. - Look. - Did you write back? No. Well, then delete, delete, delete. Yep. This area's closed. You cannot sleep here. This area's closed between the hours of 1:00 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. Come on.

Can I see your insurance card? Great. Oh, wait. Um, if I do this, would my parents get some kind of bill? They'd get a statement. That's correct. Um, is there anything else I can do? Um, well, why don't we just figure out what you can pay, and then the rest, we can... figure out a way to supplement with private funds. - All right? - Okay. Oh. Go ahead, and just hold on to that. That'll be for downstairs for payment. All I need you to do is fill out this form, right here, and we'll get you started. - Okay? - Okay. Hi, Autumn. I'm Kelly. I'm your counselor. - How are you doing? - Okay. So, you had a sonogram at the Planned Parenthood in Brooklyn, and the sonogram is showing that you're 18 weeks pregnant. Is that about what you thought? Um, no. Okay, how many weeks did you think you were? I thought I was ten weeks. Ten weeks? Okay, that happens sometimes. Because you're 18 weeks, you're in the second trimester, this is gonna be a two-day procedure, okay? Is there any way you can do it all in one day? Unfortunately, it has to be done over the course of two days. We have to put dilators in the cervix so that the cervix can open up slowly overnight. That way, the procedure can be done safely tomorrow. Will you be able to come back tomorrow? Yeah. Okay. I also need to know that you're absolutely sure of your decision to terminate this pregnancy. Are you sure of your decision? - Yeah. - Okay. 'Cause if you, for any reason, change your mind, there could be serious medical considerations if you don't complete the second part of the procedure. - Okay. - Okay? Do you have a place to stay tonight? I know you came from far away. Yeah. Yeah. Where are you gonna stay? I don't know. I was just gonna go to a hotel or something. Okay. Hotels are pretty expensive. Do you have the money for that? I'll figure it out. We work with volunteers that can help you with a place to stay. I can reach out to them if you want me to. Yeah, I... I got it. - It's fine. - Okay. Who came with you today? My cousin. Have they been supportive? - Yeah. - Okay. Can you tell me what led to your decision to terminate the pregnancy? I... I'm just not ready to be a mom. That's totally fine. Whatever your decision is is totally fine as long as it's yours. Is there anyone who's pressuring you to be here today to terminate this pregnancy? No. Okay. I'm gonna ask you some questions about your medical history. Okay? There's lots of questions. Just answer as best you can. Do you take any medication or use any drugs on a regular basis? - No. - Have you taken any medication or used any drugs of any kind today? No. Have you ever had any medical problems before, like anemia, asthma, high blood pressure, anything like that? I don't know. Don't think so. Okay. Are you allergic to any medication? - No. - No? You have any allergies to latex or shellfish? No. Have you ever had surgery before? - No. - No? Ever been in the hospital for anything? No. Have you ever had anesthesia before? - No. - No? Okay. Anyone in your family have any major illness, like cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure? - Parents, grandparents? - Uh... - No, not that I know of. - Okay. And do you have a healthy diet? I think so. Kind of? Do you exercise regularly? - Not really. - Okay. - Do you use seat belts? - Yeah. Okay, good. Any recent life changes or stresses? Um, no. Okay. Any health hazards at home? Not really. When was the last time you went to the doctor? Uh, like a year ago. Okay. And at what age did you first have sex? - Uh, 14. - Okay. And what types of sexual activity have you had? Vaginal, anal, oral? - All of them. - Okay. And how many sexual partners do you currently have? - Uh, one. - Okay. And could your partner have any other partners that you're aware of? - Probably. - Okay. And how many sexual partners have you had in the last 12 months? Uh, two. How about in your lifetime? - Six. - Okay. Do you use any condoms or any other barriers to protect yourself against HIV or other infections? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah? Okay, good. I want to spend a few minutes talking with you about your relationships, okay? Because they can affect your health. Did you know that? No? All right. So I'm gonna ask you some questions. They can be really personal. And all you have to do is answer either "never," "rarely," "sometimes" or "always." It's kind of like multiple choice, but it's not a test. - Okay. - Okay? In the past year, your partner has refused to wear a condom. Never, rarely, sometimes, always. Um, sometimes. Okay. And your partner messes with your birth control or tries to get you pregnant when you don't want to be. - Uh... - Never, rarely, sometimes, always. Uh, never. Okay. Your partner has threatened or frightened you. Never, rarely, sometimes, always. Why are you asking me this? I want to make sure that you're safe. Your partner's threatened or frightened you. Never, rarely, sometimes, always. Um, rarely. Okay. Your partner has hit you, slapped you or physically hurt you. Never, rarely, sometimes, always. Has your partner ever hit you, slapped you or physically hurt you? Is someone hurting you? Some... It's okay. It's just a couple more questions, all right? Your partner has made you have sex when you didn't want to. Never, rarely, sometimes, always. It's okay. I want to make sure you're safe, and I want to help you if I can. I have just one more question for you, okay, Autumn? Has anyone forced you into a sexual act ever in your lifetime? Yes or no? Uh, yeah. Okay. Do you want to tell me about it? - No, not... - It's okay. I'm gonna give you my number, and you can call me. We don't have to talk about it today, but you can call me if you need to talk or if you need some help, okay? Do you have any questions for me? Um, is it... the procedure... is it gonna be painful? It's gonna be a little uncomfortable. Have you ever had a GYN exam before? - No. - Okay. It's gonna be in an operating room. There's gonna be a doctor. There's gonna be a nurse. There's gonna be a medical assistant. I can be there with you if you want me to be. Would you like me to go with you? - Sure. - Okay. Okay, so it's kind of like having a GYN exam today. They're gonna put a speculum in the vagina. They're gonna put laminaria into the cervix, and that's what's gonna help the cervix open overnight. All right, so it's gonna feel uncomfortable... kind of like pressure, kind of like you have to pee... but it shouldn't hurt. - Okay. - Okay. If you have any really bad pain tonight, you have to call us. - Okay. - Okay? Then, when you come back tomorrow for the second part of the procedure, for that part, you're gonna be asleep. Okay, and I can be with you then, too. I'm gonna, like, go under? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Just for about ten minutes. It's pretty quick, all right? - Okay. - And then, when you wake up, you'll be in the recovery room. You're gonna be all done. - Then you can go home. - Okay. All right. Are you ready? - Think so. - Okay. Where's the rest of the money? I had to use it all for the appointment. Why couldn't they do it all today? You can go home if you want. Hi. How can I help you? Um, I'm sorry. We lost our tickets, and we were wondering... is there any way that you could reprint them for us? Do you have a receipt? No, we lost that, too, unfortunately. I can't reissue the tickets without proof of purchase. Okay. Um, how much for two tickets, then, to Ellensboro, Pennsylvania? $66.50 each. $66.50. Thank you. Do you want me to call my mom? No. Do you want me to call your mom? No. Then what do you want me to do? Fuck off. Your attention, please. Look at me. - Hey. - Hey. How was, uh, your family thing? It was okay. I wasn't sure if I was gonna hear from you. We were pretty busy. Want to come with me to this thing downtown? Um, we actually kind of need to hang around here, if that's okay. Okay. Uh, well, let's get a drink. Oh, I'm-I'm not 21 yet. How old are you? 20. Okay, well, no one really cards in New York, so... Um... if we can just grab a bite to eat in here, if that's okay. 492! Sure you don't want anything? - We're good. - Okay. It's always so embarrassing to eat in front of people you don't really know. It's even worse when you're the only one eating. We just ate, but thanks. So, the show was, like, super fun. It was more like an event than a show. It was in, um, an abandoned subway station. Sure you don't want to come check it out? Another time. I mean, this city has a lot of secrets. Subterranean levels. Go ahead, just take some. As many as you want. Where you from exactly? Pennsylvania. Northumberland County. Sounds exciting. What do you like to do there? Normal things. Like? School, work. Sounds like a fascinating place. Yeah, it's-it's nice. Sure you don't want to come with me downtown? W-We really can't. Okay. Are there any lanes open? - We can squeeze you in. Yeah. - Perfect. - Uh, how many players today? - Three. It's $90.47, including tax and shoes. - I got it. - Thanks. Oh! Jesus Christ. Wow. You're starting out killing it. You hustling me? Hey. You good? Should I order a pitcher of beer? Just water will be fine. Will you drink with me? Hello? Autumn? Mom? Are you okay? Where are you?

Uh, I'm having an abortion. Do you have any questions before we start? No. Are you ready to go to sleep? Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. - You okay? - Yeah. So, should we go? Mm-hmm. So, how was it? What do you mean? Like, what was it like? It was kind of whatever. Were they nice? Nice enough. Did it hurt? Just uncomfortable. How do you feel now? Tired. Want to try this? It's like a bug. - Yeah, roly-poly. - Yeah. A delicious one. And probably bad for your health. Oh, yeah, so it's good for the soul. It's kind of all that grease, you know.
