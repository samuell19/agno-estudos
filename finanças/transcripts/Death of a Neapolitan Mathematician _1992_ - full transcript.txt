Death of a Neapolitan Mathematician This film is freely inspired to the figure of the brilliant mathematician Renato Caccioppoli (1904-1959) The testimonies of those who knew him, however, have merged into the screenplay along with the imagination of the authors. What is here narrated is not to be interpreted as a reenactment of real events or people. Friday, May 1st Documents, please. Name and address, please. What's your name? Carlo Conti. Night shifts suck. Every night the same story. Sir, go to the exit. Can't I stay here? - What's your name? Documents! Then stand up, we need to certify you. Come on, let's go. Come along. What's up, officer? Hello? Yes, it's me. Good evening, commissioner. Oh God, what happened? What happened, Luigi? Oh! Oh, thank goodness. Yes I know, I know... What time the train will arrive in the morning? Yes, I'll go pick him up. Thanks, commissioner. Renato. He's fine. Yes, I'll take care of it personally. Thanks again. Good night. Sure that my brother... - What did he do? Nothing! He was halted, drunk, at Rome's station. What? He's in Rome?! Yup! Instead of picking us up at the train... Imagine! Renato picking up someone. Maybe with a bouquet of flowers. - This is really a spite! We're back from our honeymoon, he's in Rome and doesn't come! Saturday, May 2nd Renato! The coffee is getting cold! How are you feeling? Can't you see? I'm fine. There was a thing I wanted to tell you... and I can't remember it. Maybe it wasn't that important. Emilia wasn't disappointed that you left her early in the morning? She had just fallen asleep when I left. She had a bad night. She's not accustomed like me. I've acted as your big brother for a lifetime! Why, you're the littler? - No. But now I feel younger than some years ago. "Cherchez la femme!" Renato! After a night like this, could you avoid drinking? I'm fine! Alright. Then pour a drop for me too. - Drink, drink. So, in court... you'll absolve the criminal and condemn the chicken. No, today I'm not working. I'm still on wedding leave. Luigi, have you put away the books yet? No, not yet. Actually... You could keep some as memories. Some are great books. There are mom's Russian books. All of Croce's work! I wanted to know if there's anything by Herzen. And who's Herzen? - One of grandpa's friends. Oh, yeah! I remember him. His German colleague who always came with his daughters. No, the other grandpa. Why, now Bakunin isn't our grandpa anymore? Here's what I wanted to tell you. I found some of Bakunin's papers. - Really? Let Aunt Marina translate them. You never go see her, maybe she's sad about it. I'll go, I'll go. I'll need to greet her too. You said so also when mom was still alive. And then you never went. Professor, are you here? The Salvation Army is now complete! Hello, president! You're back? How's your wife? - Fine, thanks. How come you're here? I asked the barman if you could help us later with this... damn move. Is there anything to do? - Yes, take away your president. Here there's nothing to save. - I wish someone save me! Come to me in the afternoon. Here, tidy up as usual and buy some groceries. Buy some breadsticks, toothpaste... check if there is coffee, and buy some mozzarella. So maybe, casually, he'll eat it. But he throws it away every time! Buy mozzarella anyway. He likes it. And buy also some wine. So he won't drink whisky. - Now, that's right! And you, when will you wed? - When it'll rain pasta and dry figs. When Antonio finds a job! Or at least a house. Here's to the prospective spouses! The current ones, and the past ones. President! Are there some boxes to pack your stuff? Oh, that's right! And we need paper too! Renato, can we take the old newspapers in the kitchen? Who're you calling? The professor's gone! Ruffo! 30! This is the fourth time for this guy... Manna. 18. Don't come any closer! Do not taint me with your ignorance! We've run out of chalk. Somebody call Allocca, please. Professor? May I ask you a question not relevant to the lecture? - Sure. In your opinion, why did Einstein oppose the quantum theory? Because, according to Einstein, God doesn't play dice. And then, you see... the world of physical truths, and of mathematical ones, is closed as a sphere: Every new concept, if profound, is an escape from this sort of prison. One can have some reluctance, to escaping, Or one might not quite see its reason. Excuse me! For you, professor! Also two chalk erasers. But don't leave them in the classroom, professor Lauretano. Put'em in your bag. Here the erasers vanish like the Gold of Dongo! So... So you're leaving again? Where are you going? To Scandinavia? There's a girl behind this, eh? - No. In Lapland. - In Lapland? It'll cost a lot. - No. Hitchhiking, with a tent... If needed, some small job. Why don't you come too, Pietro? But I'm getting married. - I know. But Stella would have a ball. Stella would. I wouldn't. I'm not as carefree as you. Who tells you I'm carefree? Hello, Father Simplicio! - Ah! The good shepherd abandoned the lost sheep! The professor went home precisely to review your work. About time! I sent it Monday. Want some wine? - No... - Why not? It's not suited out of Mass? Just a bit. - Go on, it's light! - A glass please! - For me too. Pietro... I want to ask you a favour. Urge the professor to go to the Academic Senate, Tuesday. They'll assign the Government funds. Why, doesn't the dean go? - He's ill! - Oh, damn it! Did you read the last issue of "Mathematical Review"? - Yes, I did. It's the sixth slating in a row. - But Renato asks for it! You can't go to international conferences to tease the scientific world. Americans, Swiss... Eh! - No, I'm worried about the professor. I perceived strange signs. I've a plant at the faculty. I water it every day at the same hour. Why the same hour? - I put myself to the test. To see if every day I feel the need to do such a simple gesture. In short, a habit. And how's that related to Renato? The other day, the professor said: "Lauretano, I'm afraid that you will stop watering that plant. And this displeases me." He said just that. What did he mean? Renato always says that he wants to quit his job. Maybe he wants you to water it also when a new professor comes. Maybe. - Sure! Don't worry, that plant will get by! Have rather another glass! No, it's late, I have to go. - Come on, just a bit. Just a bit. This wine is water anyway. Today it even tastes like vinegar. Pietro, please remember the Academic Senate. Don't worry. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - Goodbye. What if Simplicio is right? Oh Leo, this craze to worry about Renato! I've been after him for a long time, and you know what? He's going to outlive us all. But sometimes habits prevent you from reading new signals. You too with signs! Actually I said signals. But, what does it matter if he quits teaching? He'll get a pension. He certainly doesn't lack interests. He can be with us, travel... right? Careful behind! - Yes, go on! Go on, go! Set it straight! - More than this? - Yes, yes. I said set it straight! Hey, what's with you? Luigi, I don't want to turn the house into a warehouse. Why keep a pool table? - I like to play! - At your age? Renato! Renato, what are you doing? I thought you'd look worse, after last night. See that he came? By the way, I couldn't find that Herzen book. - Well, never mind! Come Renato, come. Come to pick something. OK? Some paintings, some books. Lina! Lina! I'm coming, president! - Bring us some water, please. I'm bushed! Did you find grandpa's letters? - Yes. Listen, Renato... I gave mom's ring to Emilia, the one with the ruby and the gems, but, all the other jewels... You want me to wear them? - What does that mean? Why, can't you start a new family? Who's that girl I met with you at Mergellina? I don't want anything! Thanks. Lina... we have to hurry up. Excuse me, dear. This relocation is killing me! Hold this. The samovar needs to be packed gently. And tell your sister too, when she comes to help you. Did you see how many boxes I brought? You'll have to tighten the ring. Mom had the annular of an abbess. Just put it over the wedding ring. I know you've met Filippo in Paris. How is he? He's fine. I was glad to see Filippo. And then, there was something to clarify with him. - That's to say? When he came to Naples, he understood that you and I were sleeping together. What was there to clarify? Wasn't it true? Filippo introduced me to his assistants. There's even a woman. I too have a half woman as an assistant. Well, she wears a skirt. In Naples, there isn't a single woman assistant in the faculty. Emilia... I never promised you a post of assistant, or of wife, how to say... morganatic. And then, you've had other loves, right? And you? You pretended to separate from your wife. What more you think you can have from that woman? She's gone for good. - Exactly. How can you not understand? What is there to understand? Not even now? Attention please. I'll do a magic, now. Oh, too bad! Eh, it doesn't always work! And then it takes a good crystal. I'm not sure we'll take these glasses with us. But there are so many! Of course! That table was always set for eight. Why? Were you eight? - No, we were four. Actually, three. Renato would never sit. But... Mom was pleased if we brought some friends home, even without notice, so she kept ready. And why didn't you sit at the table? To get them used. That you'd leave home? This house has seen so many things! Renato... do you remember when Andr√© Gide came? Emilia, he sat right where you are. Oh, yeah? President, the paintings. - I'm coming right away! Let Renato tell you how he mangled our last name. So your sister decided? She'll marry Pietro? Aren't you happy? - And you? He's your pupil. He's a good guy. That's for sure. Goodbye. - Bye. By Friday nothing must remain here. But all this stuff goes to your house? Then I wasn't clear. Part goes to my house, part goes to storage. These, for example, go to storage. Ms. Teresa? Spend them also for yourself, not only for your grandchildren. Thanks professor, God bless you! - Goodbye. Anna, get the ball. Sunday, May 3rd Thanks, Miss! Give it to me. Stella! What are you doing? Come on, I'm late! What's wrong, are you nervous? - I'm tired. I hope Renato finished revising my work, so tomorrow I can send it and that's it! Pietro... Did you talk to Renato about our wedding? Yes, of course! Why? Well... I met him the other day and he spoke to me so strangely. He told me that I'm young, that I must study, travel the world, experience things. You've changed your mind? After all the fights with mom, I'm not going to listen to Renato. Yes, but his reasons are not mom's. But I even pity Renato a bit. And to think that when I was young, I liked him a lot! You're all alike, you women! You pity a man, you want to save him... You won't marry me just to save me! Oh come on, I love you. A little, I pity you too, though. Ok, ok. I'll come pick you up at one. Then you'll tell me why you pity me. - What did I say? Oh, so you pity me, huh? Bye Stellina! - Bye love! But you revised it all! It took you nothing, but I spent a lot of time on it. It's better not to love math too much. She, rather, has to love you. It'd be more correct to say that you rewrote it completely! True, but only for egoism. I know, I should mark the wrong parts and let you come to the solution alone. But it would have taken too long. And aren't you in a rush? I know you're about to get married. It seems like nowadays weddings are protected by confidentiality. Even Luigi hadn't told me anything about his! I only have tea left. I can offer you some whisky. - You know I don't drink in the morning. "Sagesse oblige!" I'll drink for you, too. Why did you tell Stella not to marry me? I didn't tell Stella not to marry you. I told her not to marry, that's all. And then you're surprised that I didn't tell you anything? What are you afraid of? I don't have anything to tell you anymore. You left the Party. You had the job, and now that you're about to get the chair, you want to form a family? If this is the future... - So I left the Party? Did you forget what you used to tell me in '56? Khrushchev destroyed Stalin, Stalin destroyed Lenin, Lenin, who knows how many more... Marx, Bakunin! You at least had your granddad in the family. - There is no longer that family. You too have passed an exam and got the chair. Yes, right. I went through that too. You too got married! Why shouldn't I, too? I owed her that. Anna underwent... the Fascist prison for me. Why lie to yourself? You married her because you loved her! And then, Anna! She had not certainly trouble finding who would protect her! Listen, Pietro... I no longer have the time or desire to explain what's the difference between a free woman... within limits, of course, as we all are, and a whore. I should challenge you to a duel. You were different as a boy. It's sad to see the efforts you make to be like everyone else. Go to formula 25. The exponent is not 3, it's 4. I am sorry! I am sorry! You don't think so either? May 4th I don't think so. You don't... No! Unfortunately you'll have to go yourself. But they'll come pick me up? No, no, it's you who must go. That's right! It's me who has to go. It concerns very important matters for the faculty, you know it. Come on! Hurry up to go and eat, it's late. It's late, yes! They were supposed to come get me a long time ago! Who? I really don't understand you today, professor. Lauretano, do you remember King Solomon's story? In your opinion, when the real mother tells Solomon to give the kid to the other one, she says so for spirit of sacrifice or for the baby's sake? So that the baby may live. It's you who always talk about spirit of sacrifice. Not me! You know I don't always agree. I think that even Christ didn't die for spirit of sacrifice, but so that the Word may live. - The passage is correct. So why not orient yourself towards others, towards life? You want to do like Judas? Take on a fault that's of all? Watch. This is the Word. And this is life. You see? It barely grazes it, but it can't grab it. That's only a draft. - Of course. - Then we'll edit it and see what happens. Oh, Bakunin's grandson! For months you didn't come see me at home. - Nor to my house. But you're always busy! - Tell me about it! To and fro from Rome. Good evening, Renato. Comrade, you mind a minute? - Yes. Excuse me, Renato. Hello Roberto! Hey, Renato! - So, did you print the program? Yes. Here it is. We'll start Thursday. What beautiful films! There is also Dreyer. Why don't you present some, as you used to do at the cineclub? We'll double the audience if you come. Why not? Maybe precisely "Joan of Arc". Yes. When is it? In June, right? - Yes. Professor! Oh, hello Turrese. - I know you have trouble finding Gauloises. I've a sailor friend from Marseille. Oh, thanks! I just ran out of them, thanks! - It's a... a duty. Leonardo, have you been to the last rally? No. - Too bad! That's where... Look... let's say I'm the committee secretary. I sleep in the office, not having a dime. I see that all my friends travel, go to Europe. You strangers come here, and I can't. Sometimes I seem to be more a youth hostel manager than a peace activist. Always better than Beppe and Maria who, at night, go hunt for cats. Hunt for cats? Then they sell them to the biology institute for experiments. That's awful! At Auschwitz the SS grew flowers. I already know. In the summer I work in a kibbutz. My Jewish friends accept me. Excuse me. Is there a toilet, please? I'm sorry, I offended your friend. No. Which friend? She won't even look at me! Then she's naive. You can't wish what's impossible. Look that... those who wisely limit themselves to what seems to them possible, will never advance a step. Do you like Gauloises? Yes, thanks. May I? Pietro! It's so good to see you! How are you, Father Simplicio? I didn't know you so skilled at music. It's a Bach sarabande. I spoil it, I know. I played it for my cousin Cecilia. - How many cousins have you? Your land seems to produce more cousins than tomatoes! Mom was the first of nine sisters. - Ah! Go Cecilia. - Good evening. Well, anyway, you... can always repent. What are you thinking! They always make a mess, I can never work! I know, I know Fr Simplicio, I'm kidding! You're a good priest. In a way, that's just why I am here. So... This is my last test for the teaching post. Renato just had to review it, and instead he redid it completely. For goodness sake, everything is set up much better than how I did, but you know Renato, certainly some passage were done hastily. You're patient, Fr Simplicio. And surely you'll keep all this confidential. Would you help me check? I would, but you won't do it in time by now. Why not send your own work? - There's an extension. I called Rome this morning. Give it to me. The career of a mathematician starts too early! One or two exams of Calculus... and already you think to discover new theorems. You know, Fr Simplicio, Mathematics can't be learned. It's an eye you've inside. Someone shows you the field, and you see. Right away. For this you start so young. Maybe it's that I don't see anything. I only know you must tackle the passages one after the other. Renato likes you. That's why he took you as his assistant. If you say so. I never asked myself. It's getting late. Goodbye, Fr Simplicio. And thank you. - See you tomorrow at the faculty. I apologize for the other day. For that bad wine you made me drink? I was sick for two days! Goodbye, Fr Simplicio! I too haven't seen him for 3 or 4 days. He must have gone out. Well, we should... - Goodbye. - Goodbye, professor. We should find him. You wanna see? And how should we do? Hey! Can you give me some money? I wanna get a pizza. Do you need anything? No, nothing. Whose dog is it? Is it yours? Watch it, dogs make me nervous! Don't worry, he won't hurt you. - He won't hurt me? It's just a poor dog! - Poor dog! Poor dog! He's hungry! - So give him some food! Look how he cares for the dog! He needs some cuddles too, no? Are you a foreigner? Where are you from? - Guess! Jesus, what do I know? - Riddle me this! Where is my sis? It must be cold in your country. - Look how he's dressed. As in winter. Dressed like that! And we feel so hot, instead, here! But... not to mind your business, sir, don't you have a jacket, a fine silk scarf? It's May, the month of roses! Yes, maybe I still have two suits with double-breasted jacket and waistcoat! And what do you do with it? But maybe I also keep a woman dress of yellow velvet. Oh, with the tail in the back! And when do you wear this yellow dress? As it's a bit old fashioned... Hey! Oh! - Biondino! Look who's here! Hi Marco! Good evening professor. I... - A professor! These friends mistook me for a transvestite. Hey, Marco! Did you see who came? Professor! You don't recognize me? I'm Biondino, the son of Titina the monarchic. The one who then turned Communist. I am afraid not. But one of these days I'll bring you a bunch of red roses! Like Wanda Osiris! Sentimental! - Goodnight! Professor, where are you going? - Where are you going? The clothes! The clothes! What clothes! He's a beggar, he doesn't even have eyes to cry! Tuesday, May 5th There's a train on track 4 in fifteen minutes. To Palazzo Cellamare! Listen, can you stop for a moment here at the flights of St. Anthony? - Of course. Ciro! Hey, Anna! - Peppino! Assunta, look who's here! How are you? - I'm fine, and you? - Fine, fine. Go, go. - I can't give you my hand because it's all oily. Come, come! You didn't come here for quite a while, eh? You seek Renato at this hour? - No, I stopped by to say hi. He too, only comes to say hi. I ask: "Professor, what do you want to eat?" And he says "Nothing, I came to see the old comrades." You know how he is. He never wants to eat. And you, how are you? You're still beautiful! - So are you. One of these days, if I can, I'll come to eat here. OK? Bye. I'll go now, the taxi is waiting. - Bye, Anna. Hey, wait a sec! Here! Have this rose. Bye. - Bye. The poor dean, as I said... - The poor dean? ...fearing... We've been discussing since morning! "Poor dean"! - It's clear! Fearing your... - We're making a mess here. Then we complain of politicians! One moment, one moment! - Excuse me... Since morning we don't understand... Dear colleagues, let's get to the point! Here, of 825 milions... It's not 825 milions! It's 835 milions... 10 milions more? So it's nothing! 10 millions just vanished like that? I'm sorry but those from the scientific disciplines are right. It's a matter of faculties... 10 millions, it's about 10 millions! A matter of need! I've been saying since this morning! - One moment, one moment! We absolutely want to build the laboratory for... What? The science Department has been waiting for ten years. Ten years! We need at least 12 milions! - But we said... We need about 12 millions. - The cultural relations have become... But dear colleague, if we want to talk about cultural relations we'll never come out of this! But these are rather death relationships! May I say something? - Please! ... the works will go beyond the expected deadline. So... They say they fine tuned some decisive passages. They're enthusiastic. If they can make it... Here, look. "Thanks to his sets, we will finally have a geometric measure theory." The attorney Renato Pecoraro, who defends Pupetta Maresca, is left with just one hearing. The lawyer for Civil Action has denied that the defendant has shot for love, and that hers was an act of passion. Beset by the allegations, Pupetta Maresca asked to move away from the courtroom for a sudden illness. The attorneys of Ciro and Pupetta Maresca... You know what Jesus Christ will do now? He steps down from the crucifix and flees with Pupetta in America. Poor Pupetta, though! - Why? You wouldn't like Jesus as a boyfriend? - What are you saying? I'm thinking about that poor Pupetta who's in jail. OK, I got it. Franco! Turn off that TV. In your village they veil the mirrors when someone dies? Sure! Even on Good Friday. So, in case someone died... - Knock on wood, professor. It's better if we go now. - Thanks. Thank you, professor! Goodbye. Thanks. Professor! We didn't see you last week at "Tristan and Isolde". How beautiful is death! Doesn't it seem that deep down there is a bit of eroticism? And where do you want it to be, ma'am, eroticism? Hi Virginia. Beautiful, huh? - Very! Maybe he shouldn't have left the newspaper. Now he earns more, but is it worth it? Well, yes. In fact, at least earlier he could argue, discuss, he surely had more fun... Well, shall we go? Wednesday, May 6th Renato! And your brother? He's not here. He's out for work. I'll make you a coffee. I too was at the San Carlo, last night. I know. I saw you. Why didn't you tell me, in Rome, that you would come? Because I didn't know. Maybe I would have come to pick you at the station. Weren't you at the Academic Senate? - How do you know? Because you missed another appointment. Leo! Thank goodness he found at least you, at home. I like him. - Me too, a lot. Well, of course. You look tired. It's dawn. What did you decide? That I won't keep it. But Antonio? Antonio doesn't even know I'm pregnant. - Would you have told me? I told you this time too. Why don't you keep it? Why? I shouldn't miss my last chance? And then, Antonio, with his position in the Party. An illegitimate son! And then I don't want it with him. Keep the baby, Anna, I'll help you. What's this, a compensation? You remember that Jewish girl in Capri? Right in those days I decided to abort. It seemed absurd. We were so close in that moment. I fell sick and you wouldn't bring me even a glass of water. I learned later that she hadn't saved herself and that you didn't make it. You were always locked in your room, on your own. But I only felt that you had left me alone. We had both agreed, Anna, to not have children in those years. Oh, sure. I too had agreed. This doesn't mean that I didn't want it. You know, I think Antonio has wanted me because I was your woman. It's you that he envied. It happens. But I loved you more. So I'm the one who's hurt you more. You too loved me more. So you're the one who's hurt me more. The coffee. Renato, take me back with you. Anna... but don't you see me? You can live at my house, if you want. The time for me... to go live somewhere else. In a hotel, maybe. I too would like to live in a hotel. If you wait, I'll get dressed and come with you. Anyhow, you'll need money now. Thanks. Good morning professor, do you need anything? But there is none! But today is Wednesday! You forgot that you have no class? Can you pass me that wine? How come you started with a film of Buster Keaton? Why, you don't like him? - That's not it. It was best to start with a serious film, to stimulate a discussion on the contents. Pietro... comicality is superior to tragedy. Yeah, right. Well, if I had said that it's good to distract us with a pie-in-the face movie, still you'd have argued to the contrary. - Yeah! It's better to die of vodka, in fact, than of boredom. What are you doing? To wash our hands! Pietro, Renato is kidding. - Not at par. Ferdinando, did you find a house? - No way! I'm still at my sister's. Really? - What can I do? You know? Giuseppe is going to Milan. - Milan? What's he going to do in Milan? He got the job at Pirelli. You've changed field, eh, Giuseppe? One has to live... Did you hear of that French comrade? The one who always came to our local? Well? What's he done? - Suicide attempt. - What are you saying? - It's true. He was always unlucky, that guy! - Well, how's he now? Better, he had a gastric lavage. He took some light pills that wouldn't have killed anyone. It went wrong the Russian roulette. It's gone well! Well, sure, if he wanted to fail, it went well. I would use a gun. I would aim at the nape, which is more vulnerable. I would put a pillow under the head... to collect the blood. And then... it'd be more comfortable. Then... I would shoot. But wasn't comicality superior to tragedy? You unarmed me! Assunta! Some more wine. - Right away! Here you go. Mr. Nicola, play us a song! Ready! - The bill, Assunta. One moment. Peppino, the bill! - Coming. What's he doing now, he's going to bed? - It could be. You want some whisky? - Just a sip. Did you see, Leo, that my calculations were correct? The warning glass has broken. I was sure of that. - Which glass? Come, I'll show you. When they designed the cinema below, they asked Renato to do the calculations. He was against it. He accepted just to show they would ruin the statics of the building. Now, they wanted to build anyway, and the warning glass broke. This means that the crack is widening. Renato was right. Like an hourglass of the walls. Good evening! - Good evening. Pietro! What are you doing here? How are you, Luigi? Emilia and Stella are at home, wrapping wedding favors, and writing addresses on the invites, and you're here? He's celebrating, as anyone, his last evening as a bachelor. He's not getting married tomorrow! - Then, my own. He's always the same! Renato! Giustino called, he's coming Friday. He said to wait for him. He'll come at the usual time, at noon. Look what I brought you. While tidying up I found this book... and there is a dedication to you by Philippe. "For a long time I resisted this thought, saying: Vladimir, be reasonable." "You haven't yet tried everything." "And I resumed the struggle." "He medidates..." "while thinking of the struggle," "and he says to Estragon:" "So," "there you are again," "Estragon." "Really," "Vladimir," "I am so glad to see you again." "I thought you were gone forever." Thursday, may 7th Dogs! Dogs! It is pleasing to see that women too have a brain. 30 cum laude! In honor of this girl we suspend the session for five minutes. Give an example in which the hypotheses are not met, but there is nonetheless the implicit function. Lauretano, 26! But you didn't even follow the exam! What did you want, 29? Lauretano, 29! Adele? - Aunt? I wanted to tell you something. - What happened? A while ago, I heard you talking on the phone with Stefanini. Did you invite him too? - Yes. But you don't know that he was very compromised with fascism? But Aunt, a long time has gone by! - What do you suppose? Now he frequents us just because he wants to be backed in the exam for the post. But everyone makes a career this way now! Do as you wish! You shouldn't have opened the crackers. I'll go open it. I have come to greet you too. Renato, the rate of alcohol in your blood is too high. Not high enough to set me on fire. You sadden me, Renato. You really should do a detoxification cure. Can't you see that I am no longer in conditions to help you? You've helped me even too much. My grandchildren disappoint me today. But you know that your cousin lets herself be courted by Stefanini? Oh, yeah? So now, not only we will owe him my criminal asylum, but also the marriage of Adele! He's a handsome man. Why are you so sarcastic? It was your mother and your aunt who asked for his help. Better the psychiatric hospital than the fascist jail. Or not? What if I had wanted to serve that jail time? What is this supposed to mean? Is that a reproach? Well, we should tell us the truth, one last time in life, right? But I'm not yet on my deathbed! I meant, once and for all, I'm sorry. I bet he hasn't eaten anything yet. Please, Adele, give him some mozzarella. What's there, a reception here? Later will come some professors, friends of aunt. A party! When your grandfather was locked up in the fortress of Peter and Paul, he did not disdain the help of family members, provided he could get out of jail. And you, who resemble him so much, in that circumstance you wanted to be a stupid hero? I resemble him. Too bad he wasn't my grandfather! - What do you mean? Look what I found at the Calascione. What's this letter? You, shut up! Be pretty and silent! I've never been pretty. Then just shut up. I have learned at age 12 to read Russian. I wanted to read at all costs the manuscripts of my father. And he, Renato, you know, for me, he was my father. You can imagine my pain when the French anarchists, to extort from me some papers, scoffed at me: "What right are you talking about?" "You ignore thus that you're not his daughter?" My mother denied. Even against the evidence, she denied. Look at those two photos! One is him when he was young, and the other is you. Excuse me, Adele, it's the time for injection. I'm going to prepare it. Renato, give me a kiss like when you were a kid, and you were so affectionate. Let's go. I'm going. Sorry, today I don't feel like meeting anybody. Bye. - Bye. Renato! Promise me not to drink so much. I'll quit. Renato! I came to play the piano. Don't you remember? It was in the other house, it was bombed. Excuse me... excuse me... Friday, May 8th Speak louder, Giustino, I can't hear you! Yes, he's better. I saw him Wednesday evening. He was all cheerful, he's done even the actor for us. Sure, sure. I'll tell him right away. Thanks. She too says hi. Yes, she's here with me. We're still unpacking. By the way, thanks for the nice present you sent us. See you tomorrow. Bye Giustino. They're all the same, these scientists! Giustino missed his train. You told him to come? - Yes. I called him last Saturday, when I picked up Renato at the station. You sound like your mother. Why is that? Mom did something wrong by calling him? Renato is a lot quieter with Giustino. Lina? Lina? Bring this note to Renato. And if he's not at home... put it in plain view. You know I found another hideout? There's nothing to laugh about, Luigi! Emilia... I do what I can. But this fact of the hideouts is fun. Where is this hideout? Behind the Encyclopaedia Britannica. You know, those tall, big books, all bound. The library is so deep as to contain bottles behind? How will you do with these books now? He can only use the tall ones, or else the bottles pop up. Sorry, president, but you can also put the bottle lying down. You're right. Then you must check the whole library. - Go, Lina. Come on, help me. Luigi! Professor? Professor? Professor? Lina? This package has been here for three days. Don't worry, I'll place it on his desk. - Say hi to him. - If I see him! Goodbye. - Goodbye. Lina, is this enough? Yes, for the professor it is. Now, for me, give me... Give me two peppers and two eggplants. Here, take them. Marquis? Marquis? Marquis! Saturday, May 9th He'll come now, and we're still working. Couldn't we start earlier? The family got the permit only at the last moment. But if the chapel is of the family, which permit was needed? Yes, but he killed himself! Then they'll say he had some saint in Heaven on his side. Be careful! After the dean, you say a few words, then I'll conclude. Actually, I'd prefer Sforza to speak. He's a member of the Lincean Academy, after all. Sforza is late! It must not seem strange that the commemoration of an eminent mathematician begins with the speech of a humanist who of mathematics knows very little. But that is harmonious with the spirit of our school, where scholars of disciplines apparently distant and independent find, in a friendly collaboration, the certainty of the basic unity of knowledge. This, indeed, is the spirit that has always animated the culture of the Neapolitan homeland in which Renato was educated. Certainly, to his complex figure, no background fits better than Naples in the first half of this century. That was the Naples whence shone the teachings of Croce, where no less than historical and philosophical, philological and juridical studies, flourished those... How come the marquis is here? They were friends? No. Just pleasantries. Comrade Antonio Alcamo. A friend of ours - Hello. - Hello. Do you remember when dad's panther bit the professor's leg? It didn't bite, it scratched him. I was very unsure about coming. If I hadn't come, they'd have said I was ashamed. Now, they'll say I'm arrogant. For once I got carried away by instinct. You did well to come without Anna. - After all he was her husband. ... Croce's thought. Pietro! - Too bad that Renato was oriented far away from the liberal ideology.... ...four or five years ago, and they were already separated, Renato gave his wife a land size in Capri. And Alcamo stepped in between! He built two villas there. He sold one to pay for the expenses. And in the other he had fun with Anna, get it? Well, what's so strange? - What? All this mess? It's immoral! There's an inquiry in the Party, you know? It's secret! Don't forget. And then, Renato, he could avoid to go there! Dad says that if one was born after the war, grows up spoiled. Us, instead, the panther made us become courageous. Me, it made me become fearful. - Be quiet! He had in common with us the faith in the ideals of freedom and civilization that had animated the Neapolitan Jacobins in 1799, and, refined by the liberal experience of the Risorgimento, invigorated by the dramatic experiences between two world wars, have fueled... Imagine, they found him supine. With the gunbehindhis nape. A suspicious position, isn't it? ... and his very passing away from the world seems today to bear witness to the certainty of the perpetuity of the spiritual life which has its first roots in the philosophical religion of Magna Graecia. Oh, Giustino! Finally you're here! Look, why don't you say some words? - I? But... you're even a member of the Lincean Academy. What do you want me to say? No, I can't do it. Go, go, the dean has finished. Good morning, professor. Our by now old master Sauro Giannone always bore toward all of his students a deep and fatherly affection. But he had a special predilection for Renato, whom he rightly considered the best of his pupils. He was joking, joking... and we believed that he was joking! One can make endless conjectures. This thing doesn't light at all! Imagine that once, in a public place, pointing at a mutual friend, he said: "I know well that man, but I don't know who he is!" He couldn't bear any of those known in his youth. Except, strangely, my cousins. From them, in fact... - Anyway, even then he was a nihilist. If he was the charismatic leader, Renato surely was the driving force. This is Mr. Morra, the manager of the cemetery. Thanks to the excellent Fr. Simplicio we got the approval of the curia. Only by phone, given the haste. I'd need your signature. A mere formality. In short, Mr. Morra would like to play safe. - It's the law. - Excuse me. Renato was the first mathematician to study in Italy the great problems of the functional analysis, especially nonlinear, which in the thirties received a tremendous boost with the research of Schauder in Poland and Leray in France. He faced, besides... - Poor professor! the problem of the quadrature... - They won't let him die in peace. It'll be your care, Fr Simplicio, to tell the family to tip the undertakers. To avoid that someone takes away the flowers from the tomb. You know, you can't keep watch on everything. And here, even if the chapels are locked, they're the bosses. Let them, let them take... The professor wouldn't have liked them. He liked the Flowers of Evil. The flowers...? Never mind. I don't know how happy his life was... but I can say that his suicide grieves... - Excuse me, comrade. I wanted to tell you that... the Party's backing in Milazzo is not favored by many of us. You or some other comrade from Rome should come to convince them. Why do they criticize? It's not opportunism. Certainly, the feelings and reasonings of our dear departed to be persuaded to suppress himself, will have had, respectively, the same nobility and strength to all of us known. I wonder, then. what good is striving to still do mathematics, if has renounced this someone who could do it in the way that we all admired? I had brought him a note that you'd come today... and today you came. But, where did he hide that gun? I had recommended many times to be careful. How could we know that he had a safe at the bank? I met Renato... - It's terrible! ...in 1938. Renato was going in fact through a time of great depression. He had been arrested along with his wife because in a public place, in addition to asking the orchestra to play the Marseillaise, had uttered sentences and judgments against Fascism and Mussolini. The arrest had sparked a great stir in Naples. But his mother, along with her sister, Professor Bakunin, and other illustrious figures, had managed to have him transferred from prison to a judiciary mental hospital. He blamed for it his aunt just the other day. Why, he used to visit her? - Of course, she was his Aunt. How did she take the news? - We decided not to tell her. But just yesterday, she got sick. And this morning had memory lapses. It's the age. In conversations with him always recurred the issues of international politics. We should have listened to him more. It would have been pointless. He would have killed himself anyway. He couldn't be convinced on anything. When we disagreed he'd let the subject drop, slipping away. Whereas I, you know how I am. I have to convince, or I have to be convinced. When did you ever let anyone convince you, Antonio? He participated in first person in the struggles that the democratic movement led in the postwar... See? They made a mausoleum even to Carlo Pisacane. Shame! Betrayed, killed... deceived first... and then celebrated. After dead! Well! I wonder what we came here for. But it's important to continue. To refuse to be locked in the restricted environments of living. To pursue a grand revolution, that may involve the purpose of man and the contents of civilization, along with the overcoming of the contradictions of the present. They'll hide him now! What are you doing? As memento. I collect them at the end of every trip. - Why stones? They're nice. A rose of the desert, an obsidian from Lipari... Even an any stone? Yes. Even an any stone. Will you take me to Lapland with you, Leo? Sure! At least there's nothing that resembles us there. Just think, in January he had come to renew the lease. But then you say that perhaps he had not yet that intention? Who knows! Now we'll need to renovate the house, to rent it again. I was thinking that maybe we could add that old part, you know, the warehouse of D'Ayala. Of course, the staircase is a problem. We could make a modern bathroom, maybe two. So we can rent it to a family. Provided there is no difficulty in renting it out. There's so much superstition around... But then people forget! And then, once renovated, the house will be gorgeous, you'll see that... it will be a lovely... Alfonso! Alfonso? English subs by edam17@KG November 2014
