We say that, then we are sick. - Come back or I'll be sick. - You do too much. - A vacation would do you good. - I assure you: I am in good shape. - Are you tired of Yugoslavia? - It's not the Seychelles. - You should go to the Seychelles. - To do what? To relax. You have rested enough. Go to the Seychelles. Claudia. - I'm going to be bored, all alone. - Go with a friend. Mamour, we will be fine, in the Seychelles: The coconut trees, the sun... You, me, naked on a beach... And the other apple, in Paris, with a turtleneck and tights. We will not stay in Paris. We will descend in the south. "In the south"? Yuck! The sea: A public dump. Put your left foot in the water, it brings luck. Anything! What do you want me to do with it? - For you to dive. - Me, drown! We are going late on the plane. Me force anyone. Pullovers, for the Seychelles, it's not worth it. No snow. You give me the keys of my apartment. - Why? - For the janitor. Ah ok. It is for watering the plants. Very well. You provident. Man is a mammal. Latin "mamma": "Udder". Hence the first word spoken by the child to the woman: "Mama." Association in the infant's primary brain, which confuses its mother and its teats, that is to say, maternal love and food. Nothing to do with the research you commissioned me to do, and yet, knowing that your tour starts on July 20, how to refuse people this year? I have the answer. Excuse me sir. Don't pay attention to the mess: I'm under construction. Good. Make yourselves at home. Don't make a mess. I'm joking! I am going to work. Good holidays! Anytime, you. Good bye! I'm going to buy my scuba gear. If ever the plane is late or early, you call me at this number. - Go on. Hi. - See you later, honey. - Hi. - Hi. I'm so happy to go with him! Me, in your place, it would do that to me too. Johnny Weissmüller swam so well he could pull up his shower! Good. What am I going to wear for travel? Jeans... or dress? A comfortable tracksuit. I read that American women only traveled in tracksuits. I do not have it. I lend you mine. This is an experimental love-computer, which determines if 2 beings are made for each other. A cat, a mouse: Let's make contact. On the screen we can read, thanks to a decoding system, what their life would be like. They are incompatible. We already knew that. But the love-computer gives US visual proof of this. This cat has given this cat several litters this term. They are made for each other. You have on stage a love-computer on a human scale. You sing, connected to the device. You invite your admirers to take the place of this cat. Imagine the impact! - So? - It suits you very well. In your place, I would go to the hairdresser, because in the Seychelles... Will Stephane like it? You think! He will have the impression of leaving with another. Good! If Stéphane or Air France call, - you warn me. - No problem. We are able to scientifically compose the hit of the summer by testing it sound by sound on human Guinea pigs. Mamour, it's Claudine. We have to be there early. I'll jump in a taxi and pick you up. See you later, honey. - Is it the Seychelles? - Tickets, please. Thanks. So. - Me waiting for you at the upstairs bar. - Okay, okay. Here, my sister. The ticket, please. I gave it. This is only the cover, without ticket. - It's not possible! - Look. I see, but... Jennifer! Jennifer! Jennifer! You screwed up, giving me an empty wallet without a ticket. No. Me leave, you stay. That's all. You don't mess around. You give ticket to me. You stay. - Why? - That's life. No. Life is you, me, the sun, the Seychelles. If you leave without me, you'll be bored. - Jenny baby! - Bobby! Step back. Bobby's going with me. My French teacher. Pleasure to meet you. Ciao, professor! Ciao. Jennifer! You won't leave me alone, without an apartment, without money, without love! Helen! - She left? - In the Seychelles. She left a note. "Sorry, but I'm the one leaving with Stéphane. "No hard feelings and happy holidays. Your sister, Hélène." There was no need to rush. They're talking nonsense. - Shall we have a drink? - Can't we go through customs? - I'm thirsty here. - Good. As you wish. - Did you see? There's Helen. - Where? It's nice to have come. - She's going to hit US. - What blow? She wants to leave so much that she's going to pretend to be me. 3 years ago, she left for the weekend with a boyfriend of mine. Oh, the bitch! And the guy saw nothing but fire? Me, she hits me like that, I notice it right away. Cheer! Are you two leaving? And your hair, Hélène? No. It's Claudine. It's written on it. - It is his. She lent it to me. - But yes. I preferred you with long hair like... Hélène. Do you prefer Helena? She is 100 times better. - Are you kidding me? - I wouldn't. How long has it been? - But from the beginning! - Bastard! What an actress! Calm down. You're hanging out with my man and I shouldn't say anything? Hey, you're not pushing the envelope... alright. Bye darling. Have a good trip. - And your girlfriend? - She's waiting for me in transit. Bitches! Mr Memphis, - an autograph, please? - Bitch! Hey! My stuff! Hey! - I haven't finished, Hélène. - I'm not Helen. Ok. Claudine and Stéphane are gone? Stéphane left with Hélène. - Is that your sister's jogging? - Yes. - So you speak Japanese? - Yes. Follow me. Yamada, meet a friend who speaks Japanese. Does she speak Japanese? Perfectly well. Just a charming French accent. Thank you Yamada. We're going to talk quietly. There is something that escaped me. - Do you want to sleep here? - Yes. It's quiet. It's quiet... but it's forbidden. Get out or I'll find you a bed, and for free again! I will help you! In the Bois de Boulogne, there may still be room. Faster than that! We take away! Come on! Put that in the bag. - Where are you going? - I'm going camping. - Your passport? - I am French. - Where do you come from? - From the Eiffel Tower. Here, it is a campsite reserved for foreigners. Go back over there. Passports, please. - Oh! - Hush. Me, franzose. Me nicht passport. Me hidden for schlafen in the camp. - Schlafen? From? Schlafen yesterday? - Yes. Paris? Bois de Boulogne. - Danke schön. - Englisch... It's Paris. Do you know what we're gonna do? Tomorrow, Memphis will be in good spirits, given that he and Claudia... So I ask him to advance my vacation by 48 hours, he says to me: "Yes, cocotte." And the two of US head for the sun. And there, what do we do? We flirt like sick people, you meet the man of your life, and everything is arranged. Ok? - Sir, for the contract... - Cancel! Cancel! What are you doing here? I was going to ask you to move my vacation forward. Nope! Come on, outside! Who's the one who's having fun? He is a Guinea pig of Mr. Laurent. Take her to the lab. She has nothing to do here! Out! - What is that? - They are your Guinea pigs. I said 15 to 25 years old. So you turn. Turn! The vermeil card is not my niche. - Where are we going to find them, your 15-25? - Anpe. That's it, over there. Tomorrow, Renault, Boulogne-Billancourt. Next! Case? - I have my baccalaureate. - It would rather be a handicap. Wait. - Do you like boxes? - Yes. - Do you like flirting with girls? - Yes. - Do you tolerate alcohol well? - Yes yes. - I might have something. - Oh good? We don't look stupid like that! No. No. Something is missing there. - The violins, there... - We can try the violins. Send the violins, please. - What are you taking for deodorant? - Well, Rex. There were no more then. Oh dear! Good. It's good. Carry on. No. Stop! It is not going well at all. - We respect the material. - Have you seen the template? Good. Ok. Dance with miss. Go to the other side. You have to do everything yourself. Sir, on the other side. I reconnect you. Let's go. Oh no! Look at me those curves! There, there are two of them, it made tilt between them. - Which couple? - Hold on. I will isolate it for you. Ah, those are the ones. No, but look. They are made for each other. They don't know it, but I know it. - You come here often? - Nope. It's the first time. - Do your parents know? - They believe me in the Seychelles. No kidding! Me too. Stop! You have one hour for lunch. - We take breakfast together? - If you want. - Of them? - Yes. I have two, but not together. Miss, here. And you, upstairs. So, see you soon. Do you believe in fate? We could have never met. Do you want bread? Do not move. Here! I like when you smile: You're even more beautiful. How do you find me? Funny. Yeah, but I mean... physically? You're not Redford. I've already been told that. And me, how do you find me? Sleep with me and you will know. Oh, absolutely! Hey! I like when I dance with me. I love your perfume. The tall girl I was dancing with, she stank! And mine! Like: "I took my bath in Cologne!" Do you know what I would like? That we are so well together that we never leave each other. I do not know you. Exactly. I want to live a great love story. It's because you were dumped. Jennifer, I would have left her - for you. - How nice. Yes. And besides, it's true. There, it would take a rhyme with "shell". "Overwork", "espionage", "patronage", "beach"... "Beach"! We will try with "beach". I would take you dancing at the palace. No. I am tired. I go back to bed. I didn't dare suggest it to you, but since you mentioned it first... It's fine, home. It's rustic. I inherited my aunt's shack. - My camping tent, of course! - Of course. I'm not showing you around, but it's very big. - There are cupboards everywhere! - Yes. And it's rustic. Whose is all this? Well... it's mine. You see? This is what I put on to go in the special boxes. Is it your ex-girlfriend? No way. These are my personal effects. Transvestite, go! But not all the time. I have breaks. Hi! This is Marilyn. No no. I have already given. We'll try that. ♪ Despair ♪ ♪ I see everything black it's going to rain ♪ - What does it give? - Nothing. The needles don't come off. Do you have anything else? ♪ On the beach ♪ ♪ I'll get you seashells ♪ - So, seafood? - You can do better. ♪ Destiny ♪ ♪ we were both destined ♪ Max! It works there. The needles: Boom! Well, we go with that: "Destiny". A ghost! Mrs. Memphis, I presume? You know, Roissy, it was a kind of gag. I've never really been fooled. You have a lot of humor. How you can live with someone without knowing them. It's deep, that very deep. - Am I less stupid than you thought? - I wouldn't go that far. With your 12 years of mental age, you were not going to marry Marie curie. No. No. But we are compatible. Ah, well, we'll know that right away. Sorry! Come over there. It's grotesque. Are you afraid of the machine's verdict? What does it give? What a stubborn device! What matters is that I came back. - There's already someone else. - Who? "Who is that?"... look, it's her! Here it is. I present to you my new wife. Your new toy, you mean. - We have to get divorced. - Let's go, let's go. - It will cost you dearly. - I am used to it. In this case... So this one, I want it. - I need it. - Obviously. Problem... What does he have more than me? Nothing. But the machine is formal: They are compatible. - Is it reliable, your thing? - 100%. Well, that doesn't suit me. This machine will not prevent me from having it. So you fire him. Fire it! What's the matter? I don't fit the profile, so he fires me. Me neither, then. What are you doing? My boyfriend is fired, so I'm leaving. Oh well no. It's not him. Him there. Fire him. It's him. - Fire him! - Thank you sir. I'm having a party at my house. Miss, you are my guest. Can I come with my boyfriend? I was going to suggest it to you. Thanks. - He's nice, isn't he? - A bit too much. How are you? How are you? - Were you invited? - Yes. Sir? - Should I let them in? - Yes yes. The ideal couple, I'm going to blow it up. I wish you, but the machine is formal. - Jacques is ready? - Yes. Oh yes okay. You have number 17, but don't tell anyone. - Is it for the invisible camera? - No no. It's not a joke. You have number 17, but... See you soon. Looked. That's great. Ah yes, there. Who it was? I don't say it. - Yamada. - Delighted. There is no harm. - Do you speak Japanese? - Yes. Since when? The tour in Japan, does it still hold? Yes. At Christmas. And a song in Japanese? You would be a hit, but it's hard. - With a good teacher? - No problem. I'll take it off for you two minutes. - Number 17: You have won. - What did I win? - The right to participate. - What do we win? Mr. Memphis is generous: A cruise on his yacht, etc. What's the game, then? - It will amuse you, but not a word. - Nope. It's sworn. - You are graded by test. - Oh, that's normal. 1st test: As soon as you hear "blue", you wiggle your hips, elbow to your body, and you break your wrist. At the word "blue": Swaying, broken wrist. - For 3 mins. - Ok. You are ready? Go. Go for it. Did you see the girl over there? She has blue eyes... - Blue auvergne. - "Blue auvergne." Exactly. To bring out her eyes, she dresses in blue. In methylene blue. If one wants to! In Saint-Tropez, the sky is so beautiful. It's blue! - Isn't he a bit of a fag? - Nope. But yes, look. Not the blue we see every day. The blue blue, what. The real blue. Didn't you notice? Blue blue. Saint-Tropez blue is unique. He is blue! It was? I did find towards the end the... 18 dots. - And it's good? - It's not the record. I will try to get high in the next test. You see the girl - the low? - Yes yes. So this is it. Everything is here. Ok. The 17th! Mrs? It's the 17th that... He's the guy from the... he's the... Say, you've come across a funny guy. Business in the backpack! - Who is this old woman? - It's a man. "A man"? Both are an old story! That's enough. I haven't been good. It's not my thing, this ordeal. No. It was not bad. I don't have the note, but it was not bad. What do I do now? - Good evening sir. - Good evening. Gerard! It's nice of you to come. - It is a pleasure. - My pleasure. So? What's the matter? You are not aware? I have to. It's my gorilla. There's a patient who keeps calling me. - Death threats... this is serious. - I didn't know that. - Slapped by my fiancée? - Yes. And against the clock. Oh good. It won't drag. I will put the package. Go. Come on. A bra and stockings? Did you suspect anything? Break up, break up! - I have to talk to you. - Are you gay? Yes. And that's not all. - You're not slapping me? - That would do you too much honor. You know why? Women disgust me. You disgust me. Just knowing that I could with you, I'm covered in pimples. Won't you slap me? It's difficult to play comedy love with an ugly, broke girl! Ah well! Well, there it is! - How much? - 1 min 15. That's not bad. I could have done better. You are both tied: 81 points. - But you're in the final. - Owl. The telephone test will decide between you. Champagne, please. Do you speak Japanese? Mr. Memphis wants a coach to help him with his Japanese songs. We are leaving for Saint-Tropez tomorrow. You are housed, fed, tanned. - It's an affair. - Yes. How long? About ten days then a month and a half of galas. Say yes. It'll change your mind. - It's obvious. - Say yes. Mr. Lenorman, we want you on the phone. You allow? Over there? - Hello? - Lenorman? - Yes? - Gerard Lenorman? Here the big bad wolf. I'll bite you, Lenorman. I'll make you eat all your records, even the gold ones. What? That you overdose, you give a damn. Make him talk. No no! Don't quit, Lenorman. Oh yes, yes. You wonder who I am and why. Well, Lenorman, this is my story. And tremble, Lenorman, tremble, tremble... Come on, Claudine, accept. Ok. As long as my girlfriend comes. That's good! Mr. Memphis is looking for a switchboard operator. - We'll take you too. - It's great. Did you like my story? How much do you give me, as a note? Hold the line. That is why? - Go on. Here the exit! - What's going on here? I'm 17! I'm 17! For god sake! So it was a game? We know how to have fun at Memphis. Oh yes, yes. Oh yes. I'm going on vacation for 2 weeks. We'll resume when I get back. Waiting, remain at the disposal of justice. In Paris? Absolutely. You can visit. The Eiffel tower, have you ever climbed? No. It's a good idea. Claudine! Claudine! Wait for me! I need to talk to you! - Thin! Quick! - Claudine! Claudine! I need to talk to you! Follow this car! Sure. We're going to Saint-Tropez together. - With Claudine? - Yes. With Claudine. Especially Claudine. Come on, wind! Police! Follow this car to Saint-Tropez. I was just saying that for fun. Go on! Happy holidays, my judge. - You go? - A little yes. A singer stole my fiancée from me. With my friends, we will recover it. Me, I understood nothing. Nothing. Don't worry, me neither. I thought it was a game, but they got me. I didn't understand anything. We are leaving today for Brittany. It does not suit me. I'm going to look for someone on the banks of the Loire. Very schön, the banks of the Loire. Much more schön than Brittany. Very erotic. Gunther very jealous. You tell Gunther that you want to visit the castles of the Loire. Him not refuse. He friendly. Hide me in a mobile home and presto. Hi! No no! Marilyn! Bitch! What are you doing here? You'll see! Marilyn! Gaetan! Gaetan! Gaetan! Baby! You're here? I'm coming! Row. Stronger. There it's good.

You'll get it there. - Where? - We're going to Saint-trop. - But why? - I will tell you. It's the best place. We pin them like butterflies. - Why, boss? - Even if they take the turn at 30, they bite the line. What if they mess up? The line, I placed it. Either they bite her, or they go in the ditch.

I hire a bohemian, who will predict her future to Claudine: She already knows the man of her life, you, and she will fall in love with him during an event that we will provoke. - Let's provoke. - Let's provoke. Here it is. Go get dressed. Won't you laugh? No. Above all, you put the package. And try to be convincing, like Gitane. Won't you kiss me? - After everything we've been through? - Exactly. Why are you here? There was sunshine: I came. Always funny, the Bébel. So. We said 500. Do the work and then there will be 300. It's the girl over there with the colonial hat. It's a Memphis conspiracy. He's a nice guy. You were there when Rouland came to pick me up. - I won... - Lines of the hand? No thanks. You should. She can tell you real things. Do you believe in that? I'm sorry, but it's proven. Good. I leave you. Give me your left hand. I see in your hand a man, the man of your life. Handsome man, very charming, a lot of money. I see water. A man drowns. And the one you're going to love saves that man. Remember what I said. I have a feeling this is going to happen very soon. Alright, break up. It's good, it's good. I don't know what she just told you. It's none of my business. But I know that you have to listen to these women because what they say happens. - It's wrong. - How? It's proven. Well, there it is. It's perfect. Here it is: One, two, three. Zard, give me back my 100 bucks for the bill. Thanks. But what does he want? Say, you! Beautiful lady. I will read your hand. You love a boy, and he loves you even more. You think he's gay. Problem... Problem that needs to be solved. He is quite the opposite. He is very fond of women. You in particular. He is the man of one woman: You. You have to believe what I tell you. If I... He is crazy, this guy! - So what? - I do not know. - She's on the yacht in Memphis. - Let's go. Report it before 8 P.M. Tonight I'm having dinner before the fireworks. Do you like sea urchins? - That's to say? - "Do you like sea urchins"? Yes. And you? Go on! Official opening of the sea urchin! Cheer! - What is it? - Seafood. Sea fruit. Delicious. - How do we eat? - We bite into it. Downright. - It stings! - Yes. It stings a bit. All you have to do is open them. So get to work! A small glass? Hop! We have to go. Hey! I'm drowning! I go! Do not move! We arrive! Help! I see water. A man drowns. And the one you're going to love saves that man. - But get out! - Why? But break up! We didn't ask you anything. What's the matter? It's that motherfucker from Memphis. Oh, the con! Come on, let's go home. What are you doing here? I need to talk to you. - There is no question. - Claudine! Claudine! - Claudine! - Nope! Claudine! - Where is Claudine? - She left. But it's okay? Brand new paint! What? Here! Oh dear! - Here, little jerk! - Ouch! Ouch! Here! Go ahead, Memphis! - Full ahead! - Well received. He is crazy! So. To port. On the rocks. Asshole, go! - Goodbye! - My float! My float pulled out.

Graffiti, what date is it today? It's July 14. You don't look stupid with your little firecracker. Oh, you can tell! Look! It's nice. Do you know how much it costs, a boat like that? Considering his condition, he was worthless. What? At least 10,000 f! Oh, we'll refund you. - And my pedal boat? Where is he? - Oh, there's more. Do you know how much a pedalo like that is worth? 10,000 f! - We'll pay you back. - There's interest! How are we going to pay it all back? Ben, the diva, she keeps the truck. No. Not my truck. - You just have to work. - That's the best! We already work all year, so the holidays... Ask, ask! Cotton candy! Ask, ask! Yes miss. So. Hot or cold, whatever you want. - What do you want? - An iced tea. An iced tea. So. We open our mouths wide. And there you go. 5 f. - Fill it up please. - I'm coming! Now we need to make physical contact. It's like a baby with his porridge: Too hot, he won't eat it, at the right temperature, he jumps on it. - And it's me, the porridge? - It's you. Who's going to eat the good porridge? So? It's progressing... this translation, my little? "Orlon 50%." "Washing temperature"... You have to reset it. No no. So, my little one. Come on. Good. I am leaving. A rape, you know how much it costs? You don't have to formalize. You have to be cool. I don't mind being raped, but I choose the rapist, the time and the place. - It's more rape. - Call it what you want. We haven't finished our rehearsals in Japanese. I do not care! Saint-Tropez, I have so far. Can I accompany you to the station, to be forgiven? - Full, sir? - Yes yes. - I want a coffee. - I'll give it to you. - You'll have to take that away from me, huh? - Yeah yeah. I'm sorry, about earlier. If you come home, it won't happen again. I am angry. I do not know why. We're going home... Huh? - I said to remove the stain. - Yes. It's coming. And there you go. Please, where can we see Brigitte Bardot? - It starts again. - Brigitte Bardot? - It's 150 bucks, 10 dollars. - No problem. Oh, break up. Hold on. - Have you become an idiot? - What? - There's money to be had. - Do you have Bardot on hand? Maybe we can find something similar. There are plenty of chicks here. The brunette in chamois, doesn't it look like Bardot? There are many! Embark! Approach! Thanks. 50f. Thanks a lot. Embark. Approach, embark. - Is it still far, Bardot? - Nope. We will get there. In the meantime, this is Paul Newman's house. You see? And a little higher on the right, it is the house of Robert Redford. - Here we are. - Where is she, Bardot? She won't be long. Are you ready? - Yes. - Send. - Go ahead. - What do I do? You run, you dive and you come back. Oh my god! What grace! Can we come closer? She's beautiful! But why is she brown? It's all up to my clients. Good. I will give them back. Come back tomorrow. - That's all? - But I can come back tomorrow. Account. Account. So, kids, was the day good? We will come back tomorrow. - If you forget, too bad. - We have a memory for numbers. We are two computers. He does tons of it. You have won a photo. Go on. Thanks. Don't you find that demeaning? No. The public that loves me loves to see me, and for them to love me, they have to see me. And hold on. That's the job! Indeed. But isn't this one a bit shorter? Listen. You can measure these machines. Yes. In effect. I will operate again. I'll shorten this one a bit. It's not Peru! How is she? Flawless. Send, then. Ok. Just go! Here it is! Alright for today. - Can I go swimming? - Go ahead, my dear. As soon as she is off, you scare her. We're going to go swimming. You organize a cat party. Contact in a liquid medium: It can only crack. Everyone in the water! Mandatory chat party, and I'm the cat! Nope! No no no! What's this? A shark! Get out of the water! A shark! A shark! Get out quickly! Quick! All! All! Help! Everybody is here? Claudine! Good! Help! Claudine! I'm coming! Who is it? Hold on. I'm coming! Ah! Help! Hold on! Hold on! I'm coming! What I concern myself? Lying! Nasty animal! Lying! Nasty animal! I could have done that. I don't want to see you here anymore! Lay down, bitch! We're going to the boat! The shark! The shark! It's finish. It's finish. He's gone now. Baby! Baby, I was so scared. Baby! But there I was. I was there. With me, you have nothing to fear. Baby, I feel so safe in your arms. It's normal. The shark! The shark! The shark behind! I know what you are going to say. - Little jerk! - I knew it. Never try to see me again. Chief, a shark. There's a shark behind! Get away, there's a shark! What are we doing? We haven't seen anything. I am close to retirement. Where is Brigitte? Cool, cool. So? I have no hinny. Find me one! You're funny! Who? Get over it. Quick! - Baby! - Yes? I have one, but back off a bit. No. They are furious. Good, okay. Come on, go, my pussy. And there she is, in flesh and bone. - There she is! - Wait! It's not Brigitte Bardot! It's his understudy. Captain, we're moving away. We're moving away, captain. Here comes Steve McQueen! - Did you do that? - We had a ball with Bardot. Tomorrow is the windsurfing race, with great prizes. I don't know how to windsurf. - You have 24 hours to learn. - No more. They are beautiful. Frozen drinks! Hot fries! Here Mr. Here, here. An iced coffee. Oh fuck! My judge. Very icy, without sugar. It comes, it comes. So? It's coming? Here, here. Here Mr. So. What is that crazy girl over there? He's not your ex-fiancé, sometimes? Yes. Oh! Oh! - Come! - Here, here! Come to see! Well! You are going to serve US some sweets. I need to talk to you. I'll take a shower and come back. Wait for me there. It's not okay, right? Hang on, kid. We are going for a walk. He is sick, this guy. He's sick! - Chief, a shower stall. - Oh, that's how it goes! My feet are burning! We will refresh them. Bastard! You'll see! Here is Cousteau. Good game! Make her jealous. Seduce Petronille. - A switchboard operator? - She's her best friend. The worst affront for a woman. - Are you sure? - Elementary female psychology, my dear Memphis. Ladies and gentlemen, you can ask your questions. And this famous tour? The tour will be under the sign of love. Exclusively, the theme will be: The search for the woman of my life. On the scene, spectators will try the love-computer with me. What if the machine discovers the woman of your life? I marry her. Not the machine, the woman! Won't there be thousands coming to try their luck? I hope. And as a preview, for our Japanese friends here present, I will perform the first words of my song in Japanese, and I must say also, in tribute to a lovely young woman. Cheer! That's a good question. - Well then... - Drop! - The! Bonnard! - But what... Behind the bar. - There's one that's hidden. - Release! - The big pile under the table. - I take it! The big! Dive on destiny. Banzai! Great! Great, Mr. Memphis. Cheer! - We sign whenever you want. - Cheer. In Tokyo, with your final, you stuff for 10 years. I don't want to brag, but it seems to me that this one is shorter. I don't want this maniac to operate on me anymore. Me too, I'm fed up! If you want to limp, that's your problem. Don't take this the wrong way, doctor. It's always those who don't care who criticize. When I operate, do you know what he does? Well, he's sleeping. And after, monsieur takes the Liberty of criticizing my work! I'm sorry, doctor. I want to operate on you again tomorrow, but it's the last time. I'll shorten this one a bit. Stopped! I saw it first. He and I are on the right track. I realize the dream of my life. Kid, I dreamed of working with him. Then I dreamed that he took me in his arms. The other day, he even kissed me. Watch out for waking up... - You are jealous. - No way. Do not insist. I tell you he disagrees. But no! He does not want. Mr. Memphis has other things to do. - How are you? No problem? - It bathes. Are you happy with your machine? She's fine, huh? - That works? - I want! If we tried? You say we... Hold the line. If we tried? We will try with another. Petronilla! What? Petronilla, come and see. Sorry. Let's try. So? What gives? It's a disaster. Disaster. A try. He cut me 50 cm! You exaggerate. And then you were too big. - Oh yes. - You find? - Really. - You're fine, like that. The feet had to touch the ground. You are not wobbly? A tad over here. I can operate again tomorrow morning. It's a shame, he danced well. What is it? - Pétronille swallowed sleeping pills. - Nope! - So what? - Well, you see: She swallowed a whole tube of barbiturates, but she forgot to remove the cork. But it works. - It's you who...? - Yes. - It's stupid, love. - It is discussed. I go home. I'll be back in 5 min. How about taking advantage of the Memphis car? Yes. Come on! Hey, Mr. Memphis! Can you take US? We will stay calm. Why do you say it's stupid, love? You always love those who don't love you, and it ends badly. Are you talking about your girlfriend here? Yes. Oh good. It's the same for me. I'm madly in love with a girl who doesn't want me. I'm about to break down. I was talking seriously. Me too. It's serious, love, imagine. It is deserved. It is tasted. Are you having dinner with me? I succeeded! I succeeded. I saved her. Saved, yes. My claw is ruined. Tremendous. You come with me? If I was gay, as you say, do you think I could look at you while stroking your hand? Yes. It's not hard. At the same time? Have you already tried? It's really hard. Try. It takes enormous concentration. So, my dear? We were looking for you everywhere. We were worried. But yes. Robert waited for you all evening. What's the matter with you, always bugging me? Baby, calm down. You misunderstand our intentions. He's going to run out of saliva. Are you going to listen to me, my little cunt? Eh? Good. Your problems with Claudine, at the premiere of my show, I will solve them. Memphis! Memphis! You can send. This is a love-computer. With this machine, you will know if you are compatible.

It just started again. Why are you laughing? I'm thinking of your ex-fiancé who left with your sister. He really had to be stupid, you see. Yeah.
