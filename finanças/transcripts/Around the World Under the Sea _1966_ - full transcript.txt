- How deep is he now? - 400 feet. Craig, Doug here. How are you doing, boy? I'm switching over to O-2-3, I'll turn up from there and then we'll have a sonar check, out. 'Okay, steady to go, boy.' Hello, beautiful. What about that chopper, they are still waiting for my permission to come aboard. I'll talk to them. Doug here. Brinkman, if we slow down and take you aboard we'll lose contact below. Then please terminate your mission and ask Dr. Mosby to surface at once. I'm taking you both back to Federal Science Council in Washington, urgent. Oh, right in the middle of a test. Yeah alright, okay. Hey, look. - Craig? - Yeah, go ahead, Doug. I want you to surface, but there's a pod of whales above you, so maintain present depth now until I tell you. Roger, Doug. I'll maintain this depth. Watch out for those whales now. Yeah, Doug, I'm watching. Must be headed for their breeding lagoons. Let's drop closer. What's he doing? That'll make 'em dive. Get me the chopper. It's too late, he's spooked 'em. Alright, come up now, Craig. The whales have passed. - How do you do, Craig? - Stand by, Doug. Craig! Doug, I'm taking water in. - You build up air pressure? - Roger, that's a maximum. - Then abandon. - I'm coming up fast. Hang on. I said abandon. Get out of there, you hear? I can't, the hatch's stuck. Left a dent from the collision. Break out the floatation gear. Underwater team, on the double. Man your station. - How deep is he? - 150 feet. Don't go away, pal, I'll be right down. That's it. Give me a wrench. I'll start off. You follow me down. Give me my air down below. Rat! Be quiet, they're not rats. They're guinea pigs. Hold these. Got you, come here. Craig, come on. - I've caught them all. - Well, that's nice. We've got work to do, boy. - I'm sorry, I have to go. - The guinea pigs. Oh, yes. You Americans, always in such a hurry. 'Of death and destruction on a worldwide rampage' 'these films show the tragic effects of a tidal wave' 'on a population centre.' - How do we relate this? - Had to start because of him. - Who's that? - The vice president. Vice President. 'Giant waves strike in costal cities first and always catching the population unaware and unprotected.' 'Although three fourths of all earthquakes originate beneath' 'the oceans, cities far in-land cannot escape devastation.' 'This Turkish city, hundreds of miles from the coast 'was struck by a quake lasting only 27 seconds' 'taking a toll of 15,000 lives.' 'As the casualty lists grow, the pattern of earthquake activity' 'becomes clearer and the need for scientific study' 'and action becomes imperative.' All of these earthquakes, Mr. Vice President have happened during the first few months of this year. Six times the average number, three times the average strength and we feel there are more coming of greater intensity. Is there any way to foretell, where or when? Professor Hamaru has developed a theory of forecasting. Sir, we cannot prevent earth or sea quakes. But we can erect a warning system. We have a new vehicle, The Hydronaut which is capable of establishing that system. Did she prove that on her shake down? I don't know, it just returned, little scarred from a typhoon. But with a perfect score. She was tested at 26,000 feet. She's fully automatic and can circle the globe on one cartridge of nuclear fuel. The Hydronaut was built along lines of Dr. Doug Standish and engineered by Dr. Craig Mosby. - Mr. Vice President. - How are you, sir? I'm glad you got here, I heard it wasn't easy. Well, I had help. This warning system, once established around the world would give us time to evacuate the cities if an earthquake with an intensity of the one in Alaska were to hit Japan without warning, millions would die. This is the warning device. It's so sensitive that before an earthquake happens before it's seen or heard, this device senses it. Obviously, we call it a sensor. The sensing devices are all on this section here. 'Let me show it to you.' These... veins here will transmit the information to a seismographic centre. And down below... in here is an explosive charge that anchors this device in place on the ocean floor. Now, Mr. Vice President, if we plant these sensors around the world under the sea, then pressure points along here and through here and anchor them in the crust of the earth we'll have the early warning system we need. Well, this means a great deal of risk, doesn't it? We know less about the oceans than we do the moon. You're willing to take on this risk? Well, that's why we're here. Gentlemen, I'd like you to proceed on the assumption that I can get the necessary appropriation for the voyage of The Hydronaut. Great. Yeah, we've got pretty good visibility on this sub. We've got a TV camera topside and we've got one out there in the bow and one under the hull. Watch, let's see if we can pick up Doug. Ah, there he is. 'Look, see him?' 'He's X-raying the hull from any damage after the typhoon. Should be in, in a minute or two. What about that crazy color on the hull? It's pretty wild, isn't it? But it's international rescue color. Now, you know, the sub will change color as we go deeper, it moves from yellow red through to green. What about your crew, have you decided who you want? Yeah. Now we've got to have Phil Volker. He's designed half the electronic gear on board. And we decided to go for Orin Hillyard as the geologist. But here's where the hang up comes, we want to combine our doctor and our marine biologist in one. Doug and I don't agree on this, I wanna go for Bob Johnson. Yup, I'm for a new comer on the field. - Hello there, Gus. - Hi, doctor. Nice to see you. He's done some very impressive research in Marine Biology. M.E. Hanford, from England. I'm sure you've read some of his published material the last couple of years. Her material. - What? - What? The M.E. stands for Margaret Elizabeth. Very attractive too. She just finished a research for me. Now, shall we make it, Johnson? Why, because Hanford's a woman? Half the doctors in Russia are women, not a bad example for the rest to follow. He's got a point. You want a woman on a submarine for four months? She's a scientist and so are we. Brinkman says you met her in the science building.. ...under a desk. - Her? - That was M.E. Hanford? - What do you say now? - No! No. Alright, don't worry, first we've got to get Phil Volker and Hank Stahl, without them we can't start. Stahl, he lives at the bottom of the Caribbean Bay studying underwater survival, you'll never get him. We've got to. At the depth's we're gonna dive we can't plant our sensors without his breathing gases. I'll get him, no matter how deep he is. I'll get him. Well, Dr. Hamaru is all wrong. I want no part of it. Well, then we can't do it. I mean it. Without you, it'd be impossible. No one has your knowledge of breathing gases at deep pressures. We've got to be able to get in and out of the sub. What do you want with a garage mechanic like me. I bet you've got guys with fancy degrees who'll work for you. Yeah, sure. You're just a big dumb hot head. Dr. Hamaru, warned me about that line of yours. Well, I am. I didn't go to college You know how I started under water? Cropping keel for buck fifty an hour, learn or drown. - You can give us all lessons. - Soft soap. Is it... rabbits underwater? How did you accomplish this? Oh, that's an artificial gill.. ...that allows them to breathe underwater. There's no garage mechanic, eh? - Now this, what's this? - Uh. Oh, these are embryo's, shark embryo's. 'They're called swell shark' Here, look. Right there. See him turning around? See, he's trying to free himself from the nourishing egg yolk. 'There, see. He's trying to break the umbilical cord.' 'They always do that just before they hatch.' See him fighting to get out of there? 'Look at that strength, he wants to be born.' How's that for their will to live? What about people, their will to live? The millions who'll die if we don't put down our warning system. People! Sharks, animals, they kill each other for reason because they're hungry. People kill each other for nothing. Wait a minute. There might be some people like that. It doesn't apply to the whole human race. Boren was right. He did say you're hard to reach. You let me in. I haven't reached you yet. Go ahead and reach me. Alright. What about yourself? You are people. You know that you built your house over an earthquake fault that you're about 50 miles from the Martinique Volcano? If we complete our system, we can give you an advance warning. I couldn't care less, doctor. Let 'em all go. You don't mean that. Well, maybe there are a few human beings up there. Dr. Hamaru, Gus Boren.. ...Dmitri, my crazy Russian chess-playing friend. Hey, Dmitri. I just moved my bishop from D2 to F4. Let's see you get out of that one. Shortwave. It's his move. It's your move, Mr. Stahl. I couldn't care less. I got it made done here. I got my research, my books, my music. Why'd I leave for idiots who'll blow themselves up? You really think you can keep on escaping like this? That it's not going to bother your conscience. Conscience, doctor? What conscience? You've got one. Here. This'll help you get back home safely. To civilization. No, thanks. I wouldn't want to salve your conscience. You'll never make it without my breathing gas. - And you know it. - That's right. Don't gamble on me coming out after you, 'cause I wont. I can't believe that a man with your intelligence will let a few million people die when he could keep it from happening. I'm talking about you. You don't have enough air in your tanks. What difference does it make? I'm not on your preferred list of people worth saving, am I? Here's a man who is. I don't think you even read this. "Japan has borne seven cataclysms from the sea "in 29 years. If the one which I fear is coming "strikes my country, my dear Hank it'll be worse than Hiroshima." What the hell's the matter with you? Trying to kill yourself? No, I knew you'd come through. Well, just in case, you didn't. Of all the lousy tricks! You had that thing on top of you all the time? I'm sorry. But you left me no alternative. Now that you've come this far how about going all the way with this? 'That's a real floatin' laboratory.' We've also got the crew. Well, right now my partner's working on Orin Hillyard. At Harper Island. You'll be alright. Decompress for 20 minutes and he'll be back to normal. Watch me from here. Close the hatch. - Hi, I'm Dr. Craig Mosby. - Jack Smith. Hi, Jack, how are you? I've an appointment with Orin Hillyard. - Is he still down below? - Yeah. Can I go down and see him? - Sure. Yellow flag's still up. - Thank you very much. Oh, Jack, you got a lot of divers in wet suits down there? - Yeah. - How'll I know who's Orin? - You'll know. - Okay. - 'Anything the matter?' - What? No, no, uh... could've sworn I've seen those legs before. - Jack. - Yes. - Was that Dr. Mosby? - Yeah. 'Lift him easy.' What the hell is going around here? 'Swing him over.' 'Set him right on to the deck.' 'Easy now.' Who's the idiot inside this diving suit? Dr. Mosby, I presume. Orin. Orin, what the devil are you doing? Oh, we're testing out some new mining gear. I wanted you out of that water fast. Why? Ha-ha. Thank you. 'Thank you very much.' Oh, Maggie, you know Craig Mosby? - 'Maggie Hanford.' - Yes, I think we've met. - It's nice seeing you again. - Hello, Dr. Mosby. - Orin, are you alright? - Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I'm.. Excuse me, please. What's the matter with her? We got a phone message for you from Dr. Boren. You're first choice for medic is unavailable and there's no time to shop around. We're getting new tremors. - Oh, yeah, big ones. - Ah, boy. Ah, Boren says you've got to take Maggie even if you don't want her. And, uh, unfortunately that was the part of the conversation she overheard. - Well, I better go talk to her. - Yeah. I think I would. - Dr. Hanford. - Yes. I'm sorry about that message. I hope you'll understand. 'Let me be the first to welcome you aboard the Hydronaut.' Orin and I shall be there. We already know the starting date. Well? I hope Doug is having an easier time recruiting Dr. Volker. Phil, I'll keep you on the sonoscope. 'How long do you think you're gonna be?' - We'll be back in half an hour. - 'I'll keep watching you.' Phil, will you tell me why the guided tour in this half-pint sub of yours? I've seen all these coral reefs. Patience. You know why I'm down here. Come on, give me an answer. You came to me with the premise of a recruiting sergeant. The least you can do is to humor me for a few minutes while I show you my latest gadgetry. Apparently, I've succeeded in establishing electronic communication with another specie. You watch. I talk. He learns. You watch, I'll make him turn. To the left. You need me? That's right. Well, I'll come. At a price. And just how high is your price? Look, there's a manta ray. It's attracted to the color of the submarine. Ha-ha, and the dolphin's attracted to the manta. And now.. ...the grand finale. What are you going to do with the mine? Now, I'll make him drop it. Don't worry. It won't explode on contact. Now, he'll pick it up again. What are you up to now? You see the bottom of that boat up there. - Well? - Watch. That is magnetic. Poor thing. It takes quite an intelligence to understand the devious mind of a human being. Yeah, I know what you mean. Excuse me. I arm the mine from here. We head for the surface. Fifteen seconds. Turn your boat. You're gonna blow her up? She looks new. It $20 worth of paint. I like to dress up my demonstrations. Impress you? Mm-hm. I suppose that's just what you had in mind. Why? I want the Hydronaut to make one dive for me. For me, personally. 'You personally? A dive for what?' To salvage four million dollars worth of transistor crystals. You mean a treasure hunt? Phil, I came to talk to you about people. - Thousands, millions of life. - That's for you. I'm talking about millions of dollars... for me. I don't buy. I don't go. Our mission is to plant warning sensors. I know that. We take care of my mission after yours. I can't commit the crew. Don't worry. How'd you say? Cut them in. What makes you think they'll go along with you? Haven't you heard? It's better to be a rich scientist than a poor one? If I didn't need you, I'll tell you to go to the bottom of the ocean. The earth's crust is crumbling, Douglas. You've no choice. We'll leave a week from today. Alright, fellas, come on now. That's not chopped liver. Get up. Put it on the floor there. 'Get it loaded.' 'Easy, come on.' That's a set of whiskers I haven't seen before. It's hydro electronic. From below to the surface, surface to Syncom Syncom to Washington. It's quite simple, really. We're all loaded. Where's the dame? The dame is exercising her rights as a lady. She's late. - Check. Good. - Okay. Do you know what's holding Maggie up? I understand she's exercising a dame's right to be late. We can't sail without a cook, you know. Margaret Hanford is as handy with a skillet as a scalpel. You, um, you know Maggie Han? 'Hello, there. A lady coming aboard.' Hi, how do you do? We were worried. Thank you, Orin. - Hello, Dr. Mosby. - Doctor. - Philip. - Hello, Maggie. And you must be Mr. Stahl. It's a privilege. - Just call me Hank. - Just call me Maggie, Hank. Excuse me. I have to get my hatbox. - Hatbox? - Hatbox? Hatbox. You'll love it. It's absolutely adorable. - Iddie and Biddie. - Iddie and... Biddie? For oxygen analysis. Oh! Well, I see we're all here now. - It's a real pleasure. - Thank you. Get into the ward room, everyone. - What the devil is that? - Oh, uh, this. That's Iddie and Biddie, buddy. Hm. He-he. That's very clever. Dr. Mosby. Dr. Mosby? Yeah, right in here. - Thanks. Look at this. - Here you are, doctor. You sign for the sub should be all civilian, we'll cast off. - Aha. - All civilian? - You mean the ladies out? - Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. - Thanks, Doug. - We're the whole crew? Well, the Gemini capsule only had two. Thank you, sir. I wish you and your crew all the best. Thank you. Please try not to scratch her up. We'll do our best. As you already know, of course, the program calls for us to put down 50 sensors. Now... here is where the first one goes. The east end of a Puerto Rico trench. Got that? Looks like the first one's gonna be the toughest. 'I, uh, assume that after signing on' 'no on has had any second thoughts.' Okay, good. Well, I don't see any reason why we shouldn't get underway. Man your stations. I thought we were a civilian boat. Man your stations, please. Ten degrees. Doug, I'm adding negative ions to our atmosphere. Make us feel a little better first time down. Hmm. Take a whiff of this. I feel better already. We're coming over the trench. We made that in 500 feet. 1500 more to go. Keep it moving. Look out. Here. Make the drop. Sensor number one. Orin, come up and take over the scope. Easy. We're coming in over target. Stand by. That's it. - You all set? - It's fine. Let's get outta here. Bring the pressure up inside to... eight tons per square inch. We left an empty tank in there. Sensor in position. Roger. This is it. Sensor down. Anchor it. Here goes. Number one. Here. - Signal works great. - Is it reaching Washington? I know my theory and calculations are right as far as the ocean agrees. - Craig, alert Washington. - Roger. Hello, Seismo Washington. This is Hydronaut. Hello, Seismo Washington. This is Hydronaut. Over. 'Hello, Seismo? Hello, seismo.' 'Overseas call coming in from the Hydronaut.' Hydronaut calling. It's the Hydronaut calling, sir. Hello, Hydronaut. This is Seismo Washington. Over. Standby for Dr. Standish, over. Seismo, this is Hydronaut from 30,000 feet in the Puerto Rico trench. No, I said 30,000. The chart at this point is 5,000 feet off. Our first sensor is planted. Are you receiving it's signal? The first sensor is down, Dr. Boren. Doug, this is Gus Boren, you alright? Hi, Gus. Ah, yeah, fine. Everything routine. All well. Brink's gone to check the reception now. - Okay. - What's happening? They're checking. Pressure, strain, gravity, clear as bell from the next room. It's alive down there. They must be right over the pole. The reception is as clear as a bell. Our signal is coming through fine. The message says you better get out of there now. Okay. We'll get back on course. Hydronaut signing off. Well, our first one is down, uh. Let's get back upstairs. - Stations, everybody. - Six miles straight up. Alright. Standby to blow ballast. Oh, the air. Isn't it wonderful? Now don't tell me you don't like submarines. Six miles down. Yes, and that's only the first one too. How many more are there? Forty nine. It's a bit confining down there. 'Maggie, don't worry.' 'We're in good hands.' Orin, I'm glad you're here. It makes things a lot easier. According to maritime law, Doug could perform a marriage. Oh, Orin, can you imagine spending a honeymoon on a submarine with four other men? Yes, well, I have to admit it's far from ideal. Thanks anyway. What is this, Big Brother is watching? Well, it's better than what you get on the television. Clear the deck. Standby to dive, on the double. Well, how do you do, Captain Bligh? Dr. Hanford. I asked you not to wear perfume aboard this submarine. I'm not wearing any. Maggie. - Yes. - 'Bring me a cup of coffee.' It's never the same. But always beautiful. Sometimes when I'm here alone looking out there.. ...I feel I'm in a some kind of a dream. You always were a dreamer. A dreamer and a scientist. They don't quite go together, do they? I still don't know which part of me was attracted to you in the beginning. The dreamer. No, I think you're wrong. I think it was the scientist. I remember the first time I saw you, you looked so.. ...efficient. Do you think maybe we could pick it up again where we left off? You're dreaming again. You know as well as I do. It's quite, quite finished. Really? Are you so certain? A mountain, and you didn't see it? That sonar must have been going like a fire alarm. Only the two of you up here while everybody's asleep. - Just what're trying for? - Are you her father? - That's just... - 'What're you, two boy scouts?' You're supposed to be scientists. When'll you start acting like that? - Stay outta this. - Knock it off, knock it off. Maggie, take a look at Hank. He got tossed out of his bunker. Orin, give her a hand. You didn't start reversing until you actually saw the cliff? What about the sonar? I was on visual. Why didn't you see that rock sooner? - Because I wasn't looking. - What were you looking at? It's none of you business. Oh, it isn't, eh? Now, look. I'm aware that I made a mistake. I'm aware that I've made a complete, utter fool of myself. I'm sorry. Now, if you don't mind we'll leave it at that. What do you think of having her aboard now, huh? I think you better start simmering down, Craig boy. We want to get this job finished. And our job is to put down sensors, right? Yeah, that's-that's our job. Put down sensors. Have got you the answer to Hydronaut's question? I'm just sending it out now. A-N-F-S-Q-7, answer my request. Top priority reply. Computer analysis as follows. Rook takes queen. Check. Rook takes queen? Rook takes Black's queen. Oh, pretty cocky, aren't we? Playing a little over your head, aren't you, buddy? Maybe, don't you think a little incentive might make us play better. Well, what sort of stakes did you have in mind? Something friendly. If I lose, I do something for you and if I win... then you do me a favor. - Favor? What for example? - Oh, I don't know. Let's wait and see how the game goes. Say, Doug, I've been wondering for a long time.. ...how you got Phil to come in this voyage with us. I know how you got me, that was a fair shuffle, but Phil.. I gotta be telling you about this, something that he needs your okay for. Something he needs my okay.. Yes, yes, now I seem to remember on that first dive, him saying "If I don't make your dive, you won't make mine". - What dive? - He'll talk to you about it. Yeah, so that's how you hooked him, huh? You promised him one dive, for what? - I'd rather he told... - I'm asking you. I'm on this ride for Dr. Hamaru, not for him. At least listen to him. Anything that he's in on, I'm on the outside of. Now look, you hooked me once, you're not gonna hook me twice. - What's the deal? - I needed him and I needed you. That's the only way I could get you both to come along. - 'You didn't have your mind?' - 'No, I didn't.' 'You don't have to do what he's asking you to do.' 'You're dynamite right, I don't.' Position? Doug, we're approaching Ceylon. We're 50 miles off the target. And we're getting some shock waves. And we're getting some shock waves. Okay, Craig. We're approaching the Fumaroles. Better get ready, Hank. - Standby for sensor drop. - Oh, roger. I want you to know, that if Doug hadn't already promised I wouldn't go on this dive of yours. I know that. If I needed to ask you for your consent I wouldn't have come. Everybody, into the control room. Fumaroles. Alright, standby for exterior heat readings. 120 degrees. 130. 140 degrees. 165 degrees. Orin, what's the temperature in the center of the fumaroles? Anywhere from 290 degrees to 320 degrees, boiling under pressure. We go in there, we're gonna be in one big pressure cooker. Okay, boss, how do you figure it? It's gonna be hot, alright. 'We'll have to get those sensor in as close as possible.' 'Have to do it by hand. We'll have to swim it in.' - What do you say, Orin? - Yeah, there's no other way. I know it's my job to pick the spot. I'll come with you. Okay, let's break out the hot suits. - Take over, Craig. - Yeah. How about the breathing gas? You told me to get it ready, didn't you? Maggie. Alright, I'm settling down in the bottom. This will help boost your resistance to the heat. 'When it gets hot there, this gas is gonna taste sweet.' 'But just keep breathing normally.' Mag will be reading you. Keep talking. I'll know how your are by your voices. Alright, let's put them under pressure. - You okay, boy? - Alright. Come on. Maggie, get up to control room. Monitor them on the viewer. Stay with me. - Are they out? - Yes. Put them on the TV. Put them on the loudspeaker. Phil, Orin? Can you hear me? Acknowledge. 'Orin here, receiving you.' - Phil? - Receive you, loud and clear. I want to hear Peter Piper. Orin, you first. 'Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.' Phil. 'A peck of pickled peppers did Peter Piper picked.' 'If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.' 'Where's the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?' Alright, Maggie? Phil, give me a heat reading. A 175 degrees. Inside, it's a comfortable 80. Come on, keep repeating Peter Piper. 'Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.' 'A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.' '...peppers Peter, Peter Piper picked.' 'Peter Piper..' Orin! Orin, can you hear me? He's in trouble. Phil, Orin's in trouble. Get to him quick. Phil, do you read me? Over. Phil! Answer me. Answer me, Phil. - Keep trying to contact. - Phil, come in, Phil. Phil! Phil, do you read me? Phil's going for him. Don't risk it. It's too hot out there for this suit. Orin's already picked the spot for the sensor. I'll just get in there and get out fast. Now, come on. Get out of here. Put me under pressure. Standby to pick up Phil and Orin. - Come on, Maggie. - Craig, look. Doug's gone out. - Doug! Doug! - Gimme that. Doug! Doug! Wait a minute. He doesn't have a radio on. - Get him up! - Hold it! Hold it! Come on, get him out. Watch the arm. Maggie, come and take a look at Orin. Phil, what happened down there? Didn't you hear me calling you? Hell, no. I didn't hear anything. I just turn around and saw him. Must have been a die out failure or something with the heat. Yeah, the heat. I hope there's no failure when I anchor the sensor. - How's Orin? - He's alright, I think. Alright, standby to take Doug aboard. Oh, I've never been so hot in my life. Ah, pretty hot. - Alright. How's Orin? - He's okay. What happened to you down there, Phil? He says he didn't hear us. I didn't hear you. - Is Doug aboard yet? - Yes. Alright, I'm anchoring the sensor. You can reduce the danger of the bends. Oh, boy, you're just a dumb, old hard-hat, alright. Just like Doug says you are. Now, If I could find me a mermaid built just like that. For once that guy and I agree on what would make a really tasty dish. - 'Hello.' - Hello. A swim in the middle of the Bay of Bengal. Not every girl can make that claim. What happens if a big, hungry shark comes along? Shark? Or wolf? Ah.. Maggie. What'd you say to making a salvage dive in the Hydronaut? - Has Doug okayed it? - Yes, but.. I need everyone's consent. Yours and Hank's, and Orin's. Philip, Orin's very grateful to you for going into the fumaroles to help him. And so am I. Well, in that case, there's something you can do for me. Well, then I'd say Orin owes a speedy recovery to this particular mixture, huh? Well, looks like something topless is going on topside. Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy. You'll blow a gasket. Share and share alike, all of us. Then why should Hank object? Oh, he seems to hate everything connected with civilization. But don't worry, I'm working on a special approach to Hank. Could you, uh, possibly, sort of persuade Orin for me? I'll tell you what? If you get Hank to agree, I'll get Orin. Dr. Hanford, can I see you, please? Close the hatch. Yes? Doctor, I don't know quite how to tell you this. - Except, turn it off. - What are you talking about? Are you trying to tell me, you don't know the affect you're having on the men on this sub? I'm not trying to have an affect on anybody, especially you. 'Why?' Because I haven't tried to drag you behind the conning tower? Maybe it's because I haven't asked you to co-pilot me on a midnight watch. Is that it? You wouldn't notice whatever I did. I've noticed you the first time I saw you. I noticed the way your hair was fixed. I noticed your eyes.. ...and that perfume. I can still smell that. But that was Washington and we are on a submarine and as long as we are on this submarine I've turned you off. To me, you are M.E. Hanford. Doctor of medicine, and that's all. Which is all I've been since I came aboard. Now, look.. We've got, maybe one more month in this submarine. And after that.. ...after we get our work done.. ...we have a whole lifetime. A lifetime to find out.. ...what our feelings are for each other. You men are in beautiful shape. Well, I might say the same about you. Thank you, doctor. You, uh, you're pretty rough on a man's blood pressure. If I weren't a happily married man with few kids.. I might be causing a little trouble, too. Are you thinking about what happen with Phil? - Do you think it was my fault? - Well, let's put it this way. If you weren't there, it wouldn't have happened. Where shall I hide myself? - In your work, I guess. - I do. I know. You've been doing a great job, but... I'm a problem. You men gave us our freedom but sometimes it's difficult to cope with. We'd better learn how to cope, because you'll be there working right along beside us. Whether it's in outer space or deep under the ocean. You'll be there. Check! Look at them, thousands of them. Must be in some kind of a special layer in the ocean. - Where did they go? - Don't look at me. I didn't do it. Hank got to be through collecting his samples by now. Uh, sensor number 41. Nine more to go. You two, plant this one, huh? Okay, Phil? - Where's Maggie? - In the lab. Let me tell you. Just not an ocean out there. It's a veritable minestrone. - What? - You've never seen such food. Enough to feed a billion fish. Look at that! - Yeah. But what is it? - It's food. It's food. Hey, Maggie. - Maggie, I got something... - Wait! Wait! Wait! I know, I know. You gotta close the hatch. Come on, hurry it up, will you? Come on. Come on! - Okay? - Okay, yeah, go. Hey, Maggie! Look out, fellas. What's with him? Ah, he found some minestrone. Mine.. Put us under pressure, will you? Oh, yeah. Phil, hold this, will you? Maggie. Maggie, look. Look at this. Look at that food. There's life in there so big, you don't need a microscope. But check it out anyway, will you? I gotta feed Doug. Hey, Doug, Doug. 'Hey, Doug.' Hey, Doug, Doug. I gotta get out there again. - Wanna get full set of samples. - Hold it, Hank. Hold it. But the stuff out there isn't even in the books. Okay, while they're planting the sensor. - That'll give you ten minutes. - Ten minutes. - Hank wait. - Not now. Doug, have a look at this. What? There. - Craig. - Yeah, Doug. Tell Hank to wait. Well, I can't. He's gone. - Well, call him back. - Well, I can't, Doug. He hasn't got a radio. Ah, never mind, forget it. You're worried about him, aren't you? Huh? Oh, uh, it was just a silly thought I had, but.. Hank said there's a lot of fish there like a feeding ground. You gave me this article. I read about, uh, little fish being eaten by the big fish and the big fish being eaten by the bigger fish. Position is good. Move it over. - Doug, I'm planting the sensor. - Okay, Craig. Alright. - Sensor down. - Okay, boy, I'll anchor it. Sensor's coming through fine. Where's Hank? Did you see him? No, he's got five or six minutes, though. Oh, boy, I wish we had him inside. Philip, you got Hank in your scope? Yes, but I'm getting something else. About 300 yards behind him, moving along the bottom. Looks like another sub. Or a whale? Whale? Whales might dive this deep but never travel along the bottom. I see something. It's moving fast. I've lost him. He must be between the ballast tank. Craig, Doug, look. - Where's Hank? - I can't see him anywhere. - He must be under the sub. - 'Well, I hope so.' Get in the airlock. See if you can help. - Hank come in yet? - 'He hasn't.' - Doug, you must do something. - I don't know what. Phil. What can you do electronically? Oh, nothing, His capacity is higher than ours. There he is. - I get the.. - Hey! - Come on.. - Easy, easy. 'Hank.' - Hank, you alright? - Yeah. It's caught in the tow. Bring out a sensor. - A sensor? - Bring out a sensor. - Done? - Yeah. Alright, send it down easy. Lower, lower. - Doug. - Yes, Craig. Hank's aboard. Anchor the sensor. - What? - Anchor the sensor. - What are you talking about? - Blow it! Just blow it. Okay, got you. Hydronaut calling Seismo, Washington. Seismo. Roger, Hydronaut. Understand, signing off. They're approaching the location for the last sensor. Send for the American. Reports an earthquake of 6.5 on the Richter scale. You'll get a warning system in time. Even after they put the last one down. - Will the system interlock? - Well, we'll know soon enough. Standby on your regional map. The last one. Let's give her our blessing and let it go. Hank, standby to inform Seismo as soon as it's anchored. And if the whole system works then.. ...my dive. Alright, here she goes. Anchor it. Dr. Boren, Dr. Hamaru. The last sensor's down and the signal's perfect. Get me the Hydronaut. Are all the sub system's working? Signal okay. Roger. - Coming through. - Fine here. Okay, check. Alright, standby for an interlock. Well, doctor, this was your conception. Or misconception. It's interlocked. It's okay. Call the Hydronaut. 'Hello, Hydronaut.' 'I think if it's closed, and it works perfectly.' 'The system works. It really, really works.' We did it! We did it! Great, great. Hey, gang, guaranteed not to be over 10 minutes old. It'll have you gone in 90 seconds without a hangover. Hey, who is minding the store? Get back it. Sure, but gimme time to try one on. You know, we never did really settle on just what we're playing for. Anything you say. Anything? You don't want to take a look at that last move? No, no, no. You go ahead and name it. Well, according to an agreement I have with Douglas here I need your consent for a salvage dive. And I also need your breathing gas. If I win, you help me. And if you lose, no dive. You're checkmate in two moves. No that's impossible. Why, because you couldn't outfox me with that rat-thing computer of yours? Didn't you think it was wrong to use it? Wasn't it wrong to piggyback your treasure dive on this sub? No. Then maybe you ought to ask your computer whether it's right or wrong? Maybe it'll know the difference. Or maybe it'll get a nervous breakdown in trying to figure it out. The computer I used was conceived by me designed by me and engineered by me. It's merely an electronic extension of my own mind I've a perfect right to use. That makes no difference. You lost. No dive. Using the computer to figure his moves. About three weeks ago, on my night watch.. ...I found a teletype from Washington. He's getting his information from some big stupid called MX2NR2. Does it make any difference to you that the big stupid belongs to him? That he designed it? You don't really believe he designed that thing, do you? I have seen it. You think he designed it? From top to bottom. - He-he really did? - Yup. Takes a real brain to build one of those. Mm-hmm. Real big brain. But he still felt he had to cheat to beat me. Any guy with that much talent, who wants something that bad that he feels he has to cheat to get it. Hm. Let the pirate have his treasure. Nothing. Look at this. Nothing. 'Oh, I'm sure you'll find it.' That, uh.. Go back. Back, back, back. Reverse, reverse. - Phil, you were right. - There. You're right. - 'The propeller.' - 'That's nice.' Well, what are you waiting for? I'll give you a hand, Phil. Good luck, boy When I come back, we're all going to be very rich. - If the stuff is still there. - Yeah. Phil's going out. Dr. Boren. Dr. Boren, Dr. Hamaru. - What's happening? - Must be a malfunction. 'Dr. Boren, there's an outside call for you.' Put him on the loudspeaker. 'This is Canal Zone, Seismic station.' 'We want to relay transmission from Lufthansa aircraft' 'approximately 250 miles, south west of Canal Zone.' This is Washington. Go ahead, Lufthansa. Seems to be an island in eruption or an island which is coming out of the sea. Heavy formation of steam clouds. Black material thrown up continuously. Get the Hydronaut. 'There's time for one pass.' 'My position is 130 degrees, 12 minutes 18 seconds west.' '11.15, 22 north.' Contact the air force. Nearest base. Request reconnaissance. Televideo if available. Hydronaut here. - Hydronaut, this is Dr. Boren. - Oh, hello, Gus. What's up? Hi, Doug. There's an underwater volcanic disturbance a 100 miles due, south of you. We need an additional sensor dropped in there. How close to the disturbance you want us to drop it? As close as possible. We need it to fill a gap in the grid. The volcano is 103 west, 11 north. - 103 west, 11 north, right? - 'Right.' Okay, Gus. We'll do our best. They're out there. I was right. I saw them. They're out there by the cage. Millions of them. I know the market value of those crystals. - Hank, Pill come in yet? - He just came in. Well, lock off the sea hatch. We're leaving. What do you mean we're leaving? What about the salvage? Well, there it is, Doug. No islands, deep water, easy access all the way. - That's what I figured. - Why? Orders. It's there. We just have to pick up with our hands. I'm sorry, Phil. Washington said now. We had a deal, when you planted the last sensor we... It's not the last one, they want us to put one more. We'll lose them. So many of them. We won't. No, I took a fix on them. It'll only take a couple of hours. Later, we'll get to your crystals later. Stations everybody. Can't they wait? No, it's an underwater volcano. Dr. Boren, transmission from the air force. Reconnaissance plane's coming through. 'This is air force, Roger Niner-Two-Niner-Two.' 'I have your island on camera.' 'Are you receiving our transmission? Over.' Roger, Air Force Recon. We have it. Over. 'My position, a quarter mile due south of disturbance.' 'Altitude 1500 feet.' 'New eruption starting on edge of older one.' 'Heavy fall out of hot ashes.' 'Estimated height of vapor clouds, 3500 feet.' 'Deep underwater, faint red glow visible.' 'Estimated depth, 800 feet.' Get the Hydronaut. We must have a sensor in that area. It's the only way we'll make a reliable prediction on what coastlines are threatened. Tell him to approach the area with utmost caution. And the time to get that sensor in is now. You were right. Origin of the shock waves, 500 meters to port. On the bottom of 800 feet. It's like a hell itself. Orin, what do you think? If we got to the sensor there in about three-four hundred yards, that'll be alright. Three or four hundred yards? See that shelf over there? - I'll take another look at it. - Yeah. I'll get the sensor ready for the drop. Here. Look through these. They're filtered. - Doug, the sensor is ready. - Okay, drop it. Alright, here we go. Craig, Craig. Phil, Hank, come up forward. We're buried. Question is.. How deep? Craig, the airlock, what shape is it in? No good at all. It's all stowed in. The breathing gases and the scuba gear is down there too. - Orin. - Yeah. The eruption, is it growing or dying? It's growing. Phil, if we do reach the surface we'll have to give them a fix, can you do it? I'll rig up something to send out a signal. How much air we got left in here? Six adults, one hour. No, no, no. We'll need two hours. If I can lower metabolic rate, that might give us two hours. - Can you? - I can try. Alright. Now, this is what we better do. There's no other way. I'll blow us out of this rock pile up to the surface. Doug, you're gonna blow this up in half? - Can you think any other way? - No. It's the only way. Then get all the plastic dynamite we've got and put it into AFCOM. Detonators, primer cords, the works. Others, gather all the mattresses, pillows, blankets anything soft you can find and bring it here. Hurry now, we gotta move fast. We're buried from here down. Let's not knock 'em. Grab that axe. Alright. Go ahead. Get rid of that paddle first, huh? Alright, give Craig a hand. Get all that dynamite in here as fast as you can. Get four of these dynamite boxes. Okay. Alright, move ahead. Let me see what I can salvage here. Airlock's underwater. I salvaged this tank. Good boy. This is not a dynamite, is it? - No, there's more coming. - Alright, hurry up. 'Alright.' Work fast. Shape it into corners. It's gotta blow out. Or else.. Maggie. Which leads do I use? Take a lead from the main distributer panel. We can ground it anywhere in here. - Got it? - Yeah. Gimme the black one. Okay. It's no. Got it? The guinea pigs. What about the guinea pig? Guinea pigs? Women and men first. 'Leave every cubic incubator we've got.' Alright, there's a spare mattress down in the lab. Leave it alone. It's gotta do. Come on, get out here. We got no time. Phil, We are all set. How about you? - You connected up? - They are all connected. Everybody here, where's Hank? Hank. Hank! - Hank, get outta there. - Yeah, I'm coming. Get back here, come on. Come forward. - I'm coming. - Come on up here. Get up there. Get in. Hurry. Hurry. Mind the wires. Avoid the explosion. - Mind the wires. - I'll watch 'em, get up there. Hurry up. We haven't time. Wrap this stuff around you, now. Alright. Brace yourselves. Here goes. Anchor up. We're not freed. No, no, we are not moving. Hung up on something. If we had gone for those crystals, we'd be rich and alive. I'm gonna go out there and cut us lose. - Craig, cut us down. - 'Give him a hand.' Yeah. - Here. - What are we doing this for? We are gonna have to equalize the pressure.. ...gradually. Hank. You're first. Hank. Did you hear me? Yeah. Stand by, I'm gonna open it. - 'They're not easy.' - 'Let it out easy.' - Orin. - Yeah, Dough. - Give me some flares. - Okay. - 'How many do you want?' - Two. Here you go. Alright, the pressure is equalized. That's as high as it will go. - Should we open it up? - Open it up. Sorry, but I have to take a little more than my share. Alright. You said we'd have a whole lifetime. There's not much of a lifetime left. We'll make it. We'll make it. There's a float. Yeah, good. Come on, hand me a mask. - I got Doug, gimme a hand. - Yeah. 'I cut the cables. We must be rising.' Well, the time has come to show and share the light. So there's a crystal for you. - One for you. - Hm. - One for you. - Thank you. One for you. No, you don't get one. You blew the bloody submarine in half. Well, I'd rather be a poor alive scientist than a rich dead one. Hold on, we are turning over.
