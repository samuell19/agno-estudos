Kill the witch! Kill the witch, kill! The book, destroy the book. Goddesses of moon, Earth, and sea. This wish that revenge came to me. Powers and forces of the goddess doom make. Now summon thy vengeance and thy spirit to take. My devout servant Abigail Wilcott over 300 years ago was hunted and killed by the inhabitants of an insignificant village called Salem. They accused her of witchcraft and other foul deeds resulting in the deaths of several village children. Six men participated in the sacrilege that day. And now using this magical book of the dead, I will allow you, Mistress Abigail, my faithful and obedient servant, to have your final revenge on the descendants of those who took your life that day. That book will be your gateway into the world of the living. This was in the van. It's all we found. Hell, I need a teenager to show me how to hook the thing up. Here, let me do it. Jesus Christ. - You're impossible. - Jesus, Aric. Hey, what's up, it's Tiffany. We're on our way back from the Gulf Coast. We saw Hurricane Courtney and kicked her ass, yo. Go. We helped survivors of Courtney rebuild their lives. It was a great feeling. Yeah, it was pretty cool. Shut it off, I've seen enough. Hey, what's up, it's Tiffany. We're on our way back from the Gulf Coast. We saw Hurricane Courtney and kicked her ass, yo. Go. We helped survivors of Courtney rebuild their lives. It was a great feeling. Yeah, it was pretty cool. But that's enough for now. Time for a little R and R. Just remember what my mom said. What? Careful of boyfriends of beer. Thankfully she didn't say anything about weed and friends with benefits. Jesus Christ. You're impossible. Jesus, Aric, my God. I'm sorry to hear about your grandma. Thanks. But maybe there's nothing to worry about yet. Mom doesn't know how sick she is or if she's even sick at all. Hopefully it's nothing. I am glad you guys are cool about going by there on the way home. I know you were really set on camping. Sleep in a spare bedroom or on the ground. Don't worry, I'm good. So where does your grandmother live exactly? Amityville. No, for real, Amityville? For real. That Amityville? There's only one. Okay, okay, all right, cool. Hey, let's stop here. You kids hungry? This crew, always. 28.52. Haven't seen you around here before. Oh, I used to spend my summers here. My grandmother is Florence Raymond. Ah, the Raymonds. Yeah, she lives up in what used to be the Wilmott place. I know, well, you guys be careful out there. The road is awfully rough now, and the county is not maintaining it anymore. Sure, thank you. Here, let me help with those. This is Sheriff McGrath. It's Ronnie. Haven't heard from you for a while. How's my favorite ex-wife? This isn't a social call, Steve. Some college students came into the store a little while ago. And that's a crime? One of them said she was Florence Raymond's granddaughter. So what? Florence Raymond hasn't been seen in a long time, Steve. She used to come into the store at least once a week. And now her granddaughter shows up and you're all nervous? All right, Ronnie, you win. I'll go have a look. Thanks, Steve, let me know what you find out. Yeah. And they wonder why they call them old wives' tales. Heed my warning, mortal. Here I grant you a vision of the fate that awaits you and your kind. You will pay for your crimes with your blood. Guys, wait a second. I think that pickup truck turned around. What are they doing, Dig? I don't know. Slam on the breaks. What and throw me through the windshield? They're just trying to scare us. All East Coast people are dicks! You're from Ipswich. Case in point. What do you think they wanted, Tiff? Nothing. Grandma's road should be coming up soon. Hey, wait a second. Hey, what seems to be the problem? It just stopped on me. Don't worry, I'll get it fixed. Pretty lonesome place to get stuck. Yeah, I'm lucky you guys stopped by. Not a problem. We're just on our way to my grandmother's house, so. The Raymonds. The old Wilmott place? Yeah, that's the one. Hey, you got any antifreeze? You're way low. Maybe in the trunk. Are you from Amityville? No, my grandmother just lives here. But I guess their family goes way back. Having relatives that go way back here isn't necessarily a good thing. Why is that? Goes back to the 1700s, but might as well just be two weeks ago for some people in Amityville. This woman was killed. A lot of people said that she was a witch, that my family wanted her land. But she really was a witch, and someday I'm gonna prove it. And I'm gonna clear my family's name. I went away for a while and tried the Big Apple, but Amityville brought me back about a year ago. I can't explain it. I know it sounds crazy. No, not at all. I didn't see a puddle under your car or anything, but you were completely dry. But I filled it up for you, so you should be good to go. But I would stop by the next gas station you come to and check it out. Okay, I'll do that. All right. - Thank you. - No problem, good luck. Hey, Snappy, want a potty break? Come on. Snappy! Come here, pup. Arise, Mistress Abigail. Arise from your domain. The time has come for you to live again. Your tormentors await you. Is this even a road? Define road. Tiff, I thought you said that? It wasn't like this. My grandfather passed away a couple years ago. Grandma probably just hasn't been able to keep everything nice. Home sweet home. Snappy! Snappy! I spent my summers here, remember? Grandma? Grandma? Uh, Tiff, is this gonna be cool? Yeah, everything's fine. Why don't you guys just go grab our luggage and I'll check on my grandma. Okay. Snappy! Grandma, it's Tiffany. Tiffany? What are you doing here? Mom's been trying to call you. She asked if I could stop in and check on you. You drove all the way down here from school, child? No, grandma, me and some friends were down in Florida. We were helping with hurricane relief. What hurricane? How long have you been in bed? Just since Saturday. Saturday, I do my rummage sales on Saturday. Grandma, today's Friday. How can it be Friday when I do my rummage sales on Saturday? Listen, I'm gonna go make you something to eat. And I'll clean up a little bit. I'll be right back. Snappy! Who's there? Who's there? Show yourself! The first taste of revenge is always the sweetest. Five more, dear Abigail. Five more must die before you are alive. Is everything okay? Everything's definitely not okay. Hey, can I help? You can try to help me find some food. My grandma doesn't look great. My grandma cans. I'll check to see if she's got something in the basement. Can you try to find some clean plates? Smells good. It's for my grandma, but I guess if there's some left over you guys can have some. She come down yet? No, she's not well, Dig. She's in bed. Well, sounds like we need to stay a while. Found some rooms, cleaned 'em up a bit. Thank you. Grandma? Yes, child. I brought you something to eat. I'm not hungry, really. You have to eat something, please. I'll try for you. I'll try. Leave my book alone! Leave it, child. Where did you get that, Grandma? Is it from one of your rummage sales? Do you remember the beehives? Sure I do. I remember the honey. Grandfather, he took care of them. When he passed, there was no one to do it. I was afraid of getting stung. I had a man in town come and take them away. The book, my book, was underneath the beehives. We're here doing hurricane cleanup. Lots of good people here are helping a lot in need. - Check that out. - Oh, look, woo! We got water. - All right. - Yeah! Hey, who's that chick? Does anybody remember that chick standing there? Who cares? Tiffany, how's your grandma? Not really sure. I'm worried about her. Hey, Ernest. Well, hello, Sheriff. How they bitin'? Terrible, not even a nibble. You seen any strangers around here today? I did see some college kids go by in a van a while ago. It was Florence Raymond's granddaughter and her lot. Oh, well that explains that. Why you way out here, Ern? This spot hasn't been fished out yet. There's something that's troubled the water. Well, good luck. Hey! Whoa, hey! Whoa! Vengeance is indeed cold. His icy corpse frozen for eternity. Some say she was a witch. Is that a diary? Close, it's an old homesteader's journal from a family that migrated here from Salem, the Wilmotts. Some people in Salem tried to use white magic to counteract the evil influences of the Salem witches. But Abigail Wilmott baked what they called a witch's cake. It's from the urine from the afflicted girls in Salem mixed with rye and baked. Ew. Hold up, what? They didn't eat it themselves. They fed it to a dog. And if the dog acted possessed after eating it, then I guess they figured the girls were possessed too. Well, I think that sounds totally plausible. Abigail Wilmott was accused of using the devil to catch the devil, and I guess her whole family was forced to flee Salem. And landed here in Amityville. Garden spot of the state. Poor Abigail. Poor Abigail? How do you influence people and make friends by baking cakes with dog urine? Who's up for dessert? Tiffany? Tiffany! Hey, there you are. Whoa. Oh, check that out. Somebody set out a nice, tasty buffet, huh? I wonder what it's supposed to be, beef jerky? What? Tiffany, what's wrong? Nothing, there's just some old bones and skin meat back there. I guess it just freaked me out. It's probably just some hunter's trick to draw out prey. There's something I've never told you. Something that I've never told anybody. Yeah? When I was still in school, I came home one day and my mom wasn't there, which is weird because she was always there when I got home from school. So I decided to make myself a sandwich, and I just waited for her to get home. So the phone rings and I answered it, and it was my grandfather, which was great. So we just kinda chit-chat for a little while, and then out of the blue he says everything's all right, Tiffany, but don't ever come back to the farm. Summer's over. Then he just hung up. Not five minutes later, my mom came in and told me that my grandfather had died that morning. How is that even possible? I don't know. I haven't been back here since. Sometimes I wonder, when he said summer's over, I think he was trying to warn me. Dispatch. Here, Sheriff. Sully, I'd have you run some plates, but I'm pretty sure I got Charlayne White's car here not too far from the Wilmott place. Keys are in the ignition and the engine's running. Any sign of her? Nope. Didn't we slap a no trespass warrant on her a while back? That's right, but I don't feel like trekking through the damn woods looking for her tonight. Heck, it might not even be her car. Let's go ahead and run the plates. All right, Sheriff, gimme the number. Hold on. Josiah Wilmott knew his wife Abigail had narrowly escaped punishment by a witch finder named Haythorne in Salem, but he couldn't prevent her from practicing what she insisted was white magic. Abigail attempted to cure a sick child in Amityville by means of magic, but when the child died, the townsfolk came to the house. They dragged her outside and hung her as a witch from that tree. Well we all know how well things turned out in Amityville. I'm guessing the town just hasn't been the same since. What a horrible story. Well, back then, I guess a witch was a witch was a witch. Yeah. Hey, Tiff, did you get any weird vibes when you spent your summers here? I think whatever magic might have been here, white or otherwise, I think it drained back into the Earth a long time ago where it belongs. You're so naive, child. The magic is as strong as ever. And this night shall see Abigail's power restored. Ah, here comes another of Amityville's favorite sons. Another who shall pay for the crimes of his ancestors. Hey now. Don't jacklight me, kid. What are you doing out here? I might be asking you all the same question. This is my grandmother's property. You Florence's kid? Yeah, you would be, wouldn't you? No one else in their right mind would be sitting around out here. You're trespassing, Mister. Get out of here before I call the cops. Miss Florence, she give me permission to hunt the squirrels off of here. All right, I believe you. You just gave us a fright, that's all. Well, I'm sorry about that. Y'all seen any squirrels today? Not a single bushy tail in sight. Must have heard you were coming. This ain't squirrel. Whatever. Something killed this. And as sure as I'm standing here right now, something coming back for it. I'll get rid of it before it's too late. Too late for what? Somebody keeps leaving kills here near the house. Okay, well thanks for taking that off our hands. We don't want any trouble. Then y'all best be getting out of here soon as you can. And take Miss Florence with you. That is if she lets you. Well, that was weird. What in the hell? What are you? Get away from me! Get away from me! Really, that was supposed to scare us off? That's weaker than Bloody Mary. Yeah, well it worked for me. Tiff, let me see that thing. Any spoilers in there? After Abigail Wilmott died, it looks like Josiah stopped making entries. Just kinda trails off to nothing. Kinda like trouble just seemed to follow him around after that. Yeah, troubles are funny that way. Ow, hey! What? Ow, I cut myself. Ow, how did I do that? It's just a sharp edge on the binding. Hey, looks like the fire loosened a couple of these pages. Goddesses of moon, Earth, and sea. Goddesses of moon, Earth, and sea. This wish is that revenge comes to me. Powers and forces of the goddess do make. Powers and forces of the goddess do make. Now summon my vengeance, my spell to take. Oh great, you just read a witch's spell out loud. We are so dead. But I do wonder why my grandmother got so upset when I touched this. Hold up, that was a cop, man. It's okay, it's all right. We haven't done nothing wrong yet. Think they found our still? How could they? They looked more like they were trying to find a party. Come on, they go down a dead end road. The only thing at the end is that old house and our still. They probably headed to the Wilmott place. Maybe they social workers or something. Can't take any chances, Zeke. We have to protect what's ours. This right here will scare the pants off 'em for sure. What do you think we're at a hockey game? Put that away. Get that out of here, come on. No way, Gilly, we don't need that kinda trouble right now. Aw, come on, I'll just fire a few shots off in the air and they'll run off like a pack of scared rabbits. Thinking. All right, that's a plan. I heard you. Two already. Two more who won't live to see the break of day. It has taken 300 years, Abigail, but tonight your revenge will be complete. Probably just a deer. Nothing, let's go get those college kids. No you don't. Those were gunshots. Probably hunters. Who hunts at night? Poachers. Gilly, G-Man, did you get her? Leave me alone, girl. I ain't done nothin' to you. I think you was a girl. Does that sound like a deer? Yeah, some kinda buzzkill, huh? Hey, Sully. I'm about to head over to the Wilmott residence. All right, Sheriff, but make it quick. You're off duty in an hour. Aw, I didn't know you cared. I don't, we can't afford the overtime. Damn it. I'm a police officer, everything okay? I said I'm a police officer, is everything okay? Where you boys at? You're next. Is everything okay? Yeah, it was just a bad dream. I'm gonna go check on my grandma. Okay. I have no need of this broken vessel to keep my spirit in this world. Thank you for bringing me more. What was that? Oh man, I better go check. Aric, is it hot in here? No, it's freezing. Oh god, it hurts. Dig, I think she needs a doctor, man. I'll go get a washcloth and I'll call the ambulance. It's okay. Okay, let's get you out of here. Put her in the water, it'll cool her off. Maybe we better just call someone. Put her in the water! Aric. Put her in. Put her in! Get off of her! Get off, Aric! She's a witch, the last descendant is a witch. A rival to the Mistress Abigail. Kill the witch, kill the witch, kill the witch. She has the witch's teats. She's a witch! Get the witch. Get the witch! What's wrong with you guys? Hold her. Kill the witch. Kill the witch! Kill the witch! Kill the witch! Kill the witch! She resists us. The power is strong with her. Stop, please, why are you doing this? Please don't do this. What'd you do to us? What'd you do to us? Dig, Dig. The book. Yeah? Destroy the book. You heard him. You try to stabilize him, and I'm gonna be right back. You looked like you had a dozen tits. Shut up, Aric. Join us. I'm not one of you. You're not her! You're gonna be okay. No! We have to get all of these pages. We have to burn them, we have to burn them all. We're gonna have to burn this place to the ground. Get out of here. Aric, please don't, it's me! Aric, please don't, it's me! It's Bree, it's me! Sully, it's McGrath. Cancel the backup. Instead send a firetruck and an ambulance. Actually make that two firetrucks. Scratch that, hell, send everybody. It's the Wilmott place. God. God. Hey, what's up, it's Tiffany. We're on our way back from the Gulf Coast. We saw Hurricane Courtney and kicked her ass, yo. Go. We helped survivors of Courtney rebuild their lives. Yeah, it was pretty cool. Sheriff, Sheriff. Yeah? So your wife's on line three. I don't wanna talk to her right now. Yeah, you do. She said a woman just came into the store. All the way into Amityville from the Wilmott house. You're right, I do wanna talk to her. Veronica? Steve, you better get down here right away. The Raymond girl just wandered into the store.
