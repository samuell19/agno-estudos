Oh, hello! I'm Billie Carol. Why, I'm Mike Benson. And that's Clown. Well, how do you do? [GROWLS] You new in school? Well, my family just moved here last week. Oh. You going out for track? Yeah, decathlon. You'll never make it. Well, how do you know? Your form's all wrong. You get off too slow. Are you the coach? No. That's good. No, wait! See, the whole secret of speed and elevation is a fast start, drive, kick power and the beat. The beat? Uh-huh. You have to hear it, up here. Like this. [IMITATING BEATS] And then you go! Are you sure that's all you hear up there? Yeah. No strange voices? You don't believe me? I think you're flipped. You do? Yep. Come here. And for the girls of the senior class, the reason that gentility has gone out of our society is that young ladies are no longer brought up with the grace that my mother, bless her, brought up my sisters. And the way that I'm helping my wife bring up our two lovely daughters. Come on, on your mark. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Set. [BARKS] And it is a sad comment that women have come from parasols in the garden to bikinis on the beach. See what I mean? [PANTS] Yeah. It's like, wow! The beat. You want to try something else? Sure. Okay. Come on. And what is even worse, women have been forced to compete with men. And may I say they are not happy being placed in that position. And so, in closing, this competition between boys and girls has warped the position of young ladies in society. The fault is not with you, it is with our generation. Well, that's pretty good. Watch this. So, I promise, if I'm elected mayor, I will do all in my power to set a new example for you. So, on behalf of my campaign manager, Mr. Matt Bullitt, and myself, tell your parents to vote for Howard G. Carol. Thank you. [BILLIE LAUGHS] I'm lucky you're not wearing your track shoes. Here's the rest of the team. Hi, Ted! Hi, Billie. Ted, this Mike Benson. He's going out for the team. Oh, hi. Hi, Mike. And this is Eddie Davis. He's the captain. Well, how do you do? Hi, kid. What are you going out for? Uh, decathlon. Oh, really? Yeah, really. Why? Oh, I saw you working out with Billie here and I kind of had you figured for varsity hopscotch. Oh, you better watch out for him, Mike. He's the big four-letter man, B-O-R-E. Oh, why don't you beat it, kid? Make me. Who's that boy? That's no boy, Coach. That's a girl. [BILLIE WHOOSHING] I don't believe it! Get her and bring her back. I don't care if you have to do it in relays. Catch her! Davis, come here. [EXHALES] Yeah, Coach? Who was that rocket you were following? Oh, some kid. Either you're in terrible condition or she should be running at Churchill Downs. I could've caught her any time I wanted to. Well, why didn't you? Well, the dog kept getting in the way. MAN: Here she is, Coach! Yes, sir? Uh, what's your name? Billie Carol, sir. Did I do something wrong? No. All right, you guys, take three laps. Young lady, let's you and I go someplace and talk. Daddy? Mom? Jeanie, darling! How good to see you! You surprised us, darling! Oh. You said 8:00. I know. But I got an earlier train, so I thought I'd take a cab and surprise you. Oh, it's good to be home. Well, of course it is. You never should've left home in the first place. Howard, you're not going to start that right away. No! What I mean is, she doesn't have to go all the way to Boston, when there are perfectly good colleges right here. Darling. Well, you'll be happy to know I'm home for good.What? I've decided to quit school. Oh, that's... That's marvelous! But why, darling? Oh, well, I still have another whole year to go and I decided I didn't want to be away from home that long. She's absolutely right. I think it's something we should discuss. BILLIE: Jean! [CLOWN BARKS] Jean! Now there she is! Oh! Boy, am I glad to see you! Me, too! Oh, you're beautiful.Oh, I love you. I love you, too. I have a million things to tell you... Oh! I haven't forgotten you, darling! All right, Billie, that's enough. Get him out of here. Can't you feed him or something? BILLIE: Gee, Daddy, he's just happy. Yeah, I'd like to be happy, too. Okay, Clown, come on, dinner. Hurry back, baby!I will. Well, I see things haven't changed. Between her and that horse, it's like living on Noah's Ark. Well, since the campaign began, Daddy's been a little nervous. How's it going? Oh, the campaign? Great! Uh, don't be overconfident. I found out today I'm running ahead of Mayor Davis 2 to 1. That's marvelous! So it looks like your father's going to be the next mayor of Harding. Oh, I'm very proud of you. You want a drink, Jeanie? A what? A drink. You know that stuff you pour into a glass? Oh, Jeanie doesn't drink. Oh, that's right. I forgot. She's only 20. Nothing for me, Mom. Thanks. You, Howard? Uh, no, thank you. By the way, Jeanie, how's Bob? JEAN: Who? Bob Matthews. Fine. AGNES: This is his last year at Harvard. I think so. Well, isn't he coming home? Yeah, I suppose so. Well, didn't he talk when he put you on the train in Boston? I don't understand why you're asking all these questions about Bob Matthews? Why do you think your beautiful daughter doesn't want to go back to school? Well, I'm sure that Bob has nothing to do with it. They've been going steady since she was three and he was five. Now, look, Agnes, you know that I take a dim view of young people going steady. Sure. HOWARD: I'm sure that my Jeanie is too bright to be serious at her age. And may I remind you that at your Jeanie's age you and I were much more serious. Well, that's different. I think I'll go upstairs and unpack. No, let's sit and talk. Oh, no, Daddy, I'm tired. I'd like to take a quick nap before dinner. Oh, sure, honey. It's nice to have you back. JEAN: Thank you, Daddy. JEAN: See you later, Mom. All right, dear. You know I never realized you were such an old-fashioned, possessive father. Now what does that mean? Well, at 20 you think Jeanie's too young to have dates. No, Agnes, I just think that she's too young to be going steady. Well, how come at 17 you didn't think I was too young for anything? That was different. Explain it to me. Well, you see the young men of today don't have the same standards and morals that I had when I was their age. For both our daughters' sake, I sure hope not. Now, I was a very mature young man. Not mature. Let's say, "Advanced." I'll always be grateful for that. Oh, darling. Don't you worry. You'll always have me. Oh, I hope so. You have to stop worrying about losing your daughters to other men. Well, I must admit, I'm concerned about losing Jeanie. Not Billie? [DOORBELL CHIMES] Billie? No! [SIGHS] That's a nice fatherly comment. What I mean, at the rate she's going, no young man will be able to catch her. Even if he could, he wouldn't be able to hold her, unless he's a professional wrestler. Hello? Hi, uh, I'm Mike Benson. Is Billie home? Sure, come on in. I'll get her. Thank you. Howard! This is Mike Benson, a friend of Billie's. Go on in. Thank you. Hello, Mike.How do you do, sir? Nice to see you. Sit down. Oh, uh, thank you, sir. [CHUCKLES] You and Billie known each other a long time? Oh, no, sir. We just met this afternoon. Of course, you know that she's too young to be dating. Oh, I don't want to date her, sir. You don't? Well, I just want her as a teacher. A teacher? Of what? Uh, well, you see, I want to be become a great track star. And I... I want her to teach me the beat. The beat? Yeah, well, she's got it up here. You know, like... [SCATTING] [CHUCKLES] Well, I... I know what you're thinking, sir, and I thought the same thing, too, until she beat me at the 100-yard dash, the high jump, the long jump, the 220, the 440. How did you make out in the shot put? I was afraid to try it, sir. Hi, Mike! What do you want?Hi. Sit down, young lady. Now, first of all, I want to advise you to stop competing with boys. Oh, I wasn't competing with Mike, Daddy. I was trying to help him. That's right, sir. Well, I remember a time when women came to men for help. It's bad enough that we're ruled from cradle to grave by women! But if they're gonna start becoming sports managers and coaches for men, well, that is the last straw! One mustn't stand in the way of progress, sir! No matter what form it takes! Oh? Uh, I'm sorry, sir. I think I better call you later, Billie. Oh, okay. Hey, and I'll teach you some more tricks, Mike. Yeah, crazy! Bye! Bye! What kinds of tricks are you going to teach him? Oh, music mostly. The beat. Well, well, that's fine, but from now on, try to remember that you're a girl! I wish I was boy. Oh, so do I, but you're not! Stop staring at me and just try to be more like your sister. Okay, Daddy. I will. Daddy? Yes? Do you love me? Of course I love you! I'm glad, because you're really going to have to. ♪ I feel just like a toy ♪ My head is in a whirl ♪ I should have been a boy ♪ But here I am a girl ♪ What good is growing up ♪♪ If this is all it means ♪ I'm an in-between ♪ A lonely little in-between ♪ I don't have fun on dates ♪ I feel so out of place ♪ The boys don't act the same ♪ As when we're in a race ♪ I just can't be myself ♪ At least that's how it seems ♪ I'm an in-between ♪ A lonely little in-between ♪ My father loves me so ♪ And I adore him, too ♪ Why can't he understand ♪ The heartache I am going through ♪ I don't know who to please ♪ Why can't I just be me ♪ I'm sitting on a fence ♪ Confused as I can be ♪ Sometimes it really hurts ♪ Just to be fifteen ♪ And an in-between ♪ A lonely little in-between ♪ That's me ♪ If you had listened to me, we wouldn't have this trouble with her racing with boys.

Oh! Oh, hello! It's... It's good to see you. Thank you. Come on in, come on in. Sit down, sit down. I can only stay for a moment. Would you like a drink? No, thank you. I'd merely like to get to the point of why I came to visit. HOWARD: Well, uh, why? Howard, I have been Principal at Harding for the past 23 years. Well, congratulations. Thank you. I'd like to say without malice or anger that until today I've never been subjected to any gross indignity. Well, Arnold, after I'm elected... You've missed the whole point. AGNES: [STUTTERS] What is the point, Arnold? Oh, don't you know? No. No. This afternoon Billie went out for the track team. The boys' track team? That's the only kind we have. AGNES: Billie? Uh, we'll settle this in five minutes. BILLIE: Yes, Mom? Would you come down... Billie, come down here! Now, who allowed her to go out for the team? The coach. He says she runs like a gazelle and jumps like a kangaroo. He was going to shame the boys into trying harder. Well, can't you declare the girl is ineligible? On what grounds? I'm not defending her. I'm just asking. Look, Agnes, do me a favor and don't ask questions like that in front of her. Did you want me, Daddy? I most certainly did. Hello, Mr. Wilson.ARNOLD: Billie. Now, Billie, what is this foolishness about you trying out for the boys' track team? Well, the coach asked me to. Well, you're not going to do it! I'm not? Well, darling, it is a strenuous sport for a girl. Oh, not for me, Mom. I've got the beat. [IMITATING BEATS] Young lady, you're going to force me to pass a regulation prohibiting girls from partaking in any sport. Mr. Wilson, if I'm denied my athletic rights, I refuse to attend classes. ARNOLD: I will have you expelled! But, sir, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights guarantee every American citizen life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Are you going to let her talk to me like that? What? Oh, no. No, no, no. You go upstairs, young lady. I'll discuss this with you later. Yes, sir.Excuse me. Well, I hope you've got the solution. No, but I... I do think some of her arguments made a great deal of sense. I might have expected you to say that. What does the coach think? We don't pay the coach to think! We pay the coach to teach English. Now, Arnold, don't you think a child should be allowed to seek some of his own fulfillments? No. That's a fine way for a father to talk! It's the only sensible way to talk! Well, I'm just more progressive than you are! I believe that if Billie thinks she has a chance to make that boys' team, then she should be allowed to try it.You do? I most certainly do! I see. Well, then I don't blame Billie. It's obvious that you're in greater need of help than she is. Oh! AGNES: How are we doing down here? Well, fine, fine! We're doing fine. Agnes, it is my considered opinion that your husband is a blight on the American academic scene and a full-grown juvenile delinquent! [DOOR SLAMS] I'm certainly glad to see there are no hard feelings between you and Arnold. Did you see the way Billie stood up to him? I saw the way you smiled. I wonder if she is part gazelle. Not from my side of the family. Boys' track team? [CHUCKLES] Oh, that's ridiculous. Would give you an elk's tooth to see her make it. No, no, but it amuses me. It'll probably make the front pages of the newspaper in the morning. Probably. Right next to your now famous "girls shouldn't compete with boys" speech. [CROWD CHEERING] [WHISTLE BLOWS] I'm all right. Thank you. Well, at least the wind won't stop her. Stop her what? This is no joke. If she doesn't make it past these timed trials, Coach Jones could cut her off the team. [WHISTLE BLOWS] All right, let's go, out there! Hello, Howie, Agnes. Hello. Hello, Charlie. Hello, Jean. JEAN: Hello, Mr. Davis. My, you both look pretty.Thank you. Hi, Matt. MATT: Mayor Davis. I've been trying to get you at your office all afternoon, Howard. I was, uh, busy. Just wanted to congratulate you and Matt on your campaign. Thank you. That was quite a speech you made the other day on a woman's rights in society, and it gave me a wonderful idea. You're going to withdraw. That's very funny. HOWARD: Thank you. Seriously, though, why don't you and I have a few public debates? What for?Well, everybody else does. On what issues? Well, for example, I don't feel the same way you do about women's rights. Maybe we can have some fun with that. Well, I... I suppose so. Good, I'll have Tim get in touch with Matt. All... All right. All right, Charlie. See you all later. What do you suppose he's up to? Oh, he's... He's grabbing at straws. He'll probably try to make Billie's activities a campaign issue. It's ridiculous. Why is it ridiculous? Nobody can be that narrow-minded. It's not as if she's playing a contact sport with boys. Somebody might be offended by that. I don't agree with that either. You don't? No. Boys and girls have been playing contact sports for years. Never hurt anybody. [WHISTLE BLOWS] COACH: All right, take your marks. Everybody, behind the line! Put your hands behind the line. All right. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [BARKING] COACH: Set! Go! Run, kid, run! If I had that many boys chasing me, I'd run, too! I wouldn't! She must be insane. Do you hear the beat? Yeah! Come on! Only one thing worries me. What's that? I wonder if Billie and the team dress together. MAN 1: Watching a girl from behind makes losing a pleasure. It's liable to put Harding on the map. The only school in the country with its own built-in date. MAN 2: Gentlemen, I saw her first. That won't help you out any. [ALL LAUGHING] All right. [WHISTLES] Hold it down. There's a lady on our team. And the first one that forgets it, I'm gonna belt square in the mouth. I haven't found a teenager yet I couldn't take in a fair but dirty street fight. Oh, hello, Mr. Carol! Where's my daughter? What kind of a team do you think I coach, Mr. Carol? You mean she didn't make the team? Of course she made it! She's my star. Well, then, where is she? Down the hall by herself in the stars' dressing room. Oh, yeah. Thank you, Coach. JEAN: How soon will she be out, Daddy? Uh, she's... She's right down here. AGNES: Not really. Billie? Come in, Daddy. Billie, you made it, honey! You were marvelous! And I'm furious, too! Why? Look at this locker room. What's wrong with it? Boiling, just boiling! Why, darling? The boys fixed it up. Look at it! I think it's sweet. Mom, they're making fun of me. How do you know that? Because they treat me like a girl and not an equal. Darling, you are a girl. I don't care. I want to be an equal first! She's discovered a whole new sex. Boys, girls, and equals. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GROWLS] You see? Then eventually you'll get to hear it without the record player. Why are you staring at me? [GROWLS] Uh, [STAMMERS] was I staring at you? Yeah. You're staring at me. [GROANS] Oh, well, I didn't realize I was staring at you. Oh. Okay. Mike, you're still staring at me. [GROWLS] [ROARS] Well, I... I think I better get home. We're here to work! Well, I think I've, uh, worked enough today. [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Mike, if you want anything out of life, you gotta have more perseverance. That's why I think I'd better go home. So long, Billie. What are you doing? Oh, I'm making some notes for tonight's debate. Here. Thank you. My, Agnes, you look beautiful! You're sort of cute yourself. You know, I'm slightly confused as to what stand you're gonna take tonight. Why? Well, how can you say women shouldn't compete with men, but it's okay for Billie to be on the boys' track team. Oh, I've got a whole new theory, you see. My new theme is, "Everyone should be allowed to do exactly what they want to do." [PHONE RINGING] Lead to a terrible disease called hoof in the mouth. Hello. Yes, yes, she is. Uh, who's calling? I see, uh, hold on. Jeanie. Bob Matthews is calling from Boston. JEAN: I'll take it up here. AGNES: What's the matter? Jeanie asked me to please hang up. After all, he wasn't calling you. I know. But he said, "Hello, darling." AGNES: That's nice. Well, you don't suppose she's serious about that boy, do you? Maybe he's just serious about her. Oh, but she couldn't be going with just one boy. Didn't you say one minute ago, "Anybody should be allowed to do anything they want to do"? Not on a personal level. Oh, I see. Anything anybody wants to do, provided you approve. No, that isn't what I meant. Bob sends you all his love. AGNES: Good. Why was, uh, he calling you from Boston? Oh, just to talk. And, uh, how come he called you "darling"? It's her nickname. Come on, Howard. We'll be late. No, just a minute, Agnes. There's something I want to say to Jeanie. Jean, I think you're far too young to be going with just one boy. But Dad... Or even seriously thinking about one boy. So, from now on, I wish you'd respect my wishes and date a lot of young men. Howard, if we don't hurry, we'll miss your half of the debate. All right, you girls ready? Well, Mike's gonna pick us up. We'll be right there. See you later, kids. Good luck, Daddy. Thank you, dear. [WHIMPERING] Boy, he sure doesn't dig going steady. I know. And when he hears my news, he's going to die. Why? What's your news? Bob and I are married. [WHIMPERS] Married? You heard it, sister. Oh, Jeanie. That's great! Married. Oh, I'm so happy for... When did you get married? Seven months ago. Oh, Jeanie. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell them? Oh, forget it. I'm sorry I asked. Married... Oh, boy. Oh, boy. When this news comes out, is he gonna flip. JEAN: You just don't know. I came home, because I think we're having a baby. [BARKING] Oh, ho, ho, and a half. I get the report from Doctor Hall tomorrow. I think Clown and I might just take a cross-country trot tomorrow. So, you see, it's a good thing you're not more like me. Especially at your age. Yeah, if I was, sister dear, Daddy would kill both of us. [INAUDIBLE] [WHIMPERING] [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] Mr. Carol. Exactly what do you mean when you say, "Everybody should be allowed to do what he wants to do"? Mr. Mayor, just exactly that. Isn't that merely a reckless statement of expediency? HOWARD: No, it is not. It's anarchy. That's what it is. [AUDIENCE JEERS] No, it's not anarchy, Mrs. Hosenwacker. It's good common sense. MAN: Suppose your daughter wanted to burn down the house, would you let her do it? No, of course not. Suppose she only wanted to burn down one room? Well, that depends on which room. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [WHIMPERING] Do you approve of your daughter being on the boys' track team? HOWARD: No, not particularly. WOMAN: Then why don't you get her off? Well, as a good progressive parent I don't think that I should stand in her way. Well, it seems to me if you can't handle your own family affairs, you're not qualified to run a town. Mr. Mayor, my personal life has nothing to do with the issues at hand. Of course it does. If you carry your so-called progressive ideas into politics, our entire social structure could become a bedlam, in no time at all.[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] [GROWLING] Thank you, Doctor. And don't forget. Check-up once a month. I won't. Thank you. Congratulations to you. I peeked at the lab report. Those rabbits never lie. Thank you, Miss Webb. I'd like to talk to Mayor Davis, please. Up, down, up, down, up, down. One, two, three, four. Look alive. One, two. Stay with the counts. Up, down, up, down, up, down. Cadman, look alive, will you? Up, down. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Up, down, up, down, up, down. One, two, three, four. Look alive. One, two... Uh, Coach Jones. Yes. I'm Ray Case and this is Allan Grant of Life. How do you do? Glad to see you.How are you, Coach? Well, where would you like me to stand? Uh, no, no. We'd like to talk to the little girl and then get some pictures of her in action. Oh. Uh, tell me, is she as fast as you told us on the phone? Faster. How do you account for that? I don't know. Why don't you ask her? Carol. Come over here. Yes, Coach? Billie, this is Mr. Case and Mr. Grant from Life. Hi, Billie. ALLAN: Hello, Billie. How do you do? Wanna take some shots of you in action. What for? Just a little human interest story. Oh! Okay. Suppose you start by telling us how you learned to run so fast? Oh, that's easy. First of all, I've been racing my dog, Clown, for years. I believe in competing with the best. I see. And then there's the beat. The beat? Uh-huh. The beat. You see, I hear it up here. And when I wanna go faster, I speed up the beat and I go. You're putting me on. No, really. You see, track and field is like dance without music. And once you add the music, zoom, off you go. You mean you hear music all the time? That's right, like this. Well... Suppose you give us a sample? Well, sure. Where would you like to start? Do you pole vault? How high? I'll let you decide that. Okay. It's at 11 feet now. Why don't we just leave it there? Hey, Coach. Oh! Hey. All right, look, you guys take a... Take a lap. [ALL MUTTERING] Hello, Coach. Oh! Hello, Howie.Where's Billie? Oh. Wait a minute. That bar must be 10 feet high. Eleven feet. But she'll kill herself! HOWARD: Billie, don't. Billie, wait. Billie! Bill... No! [GROANING] Oh! Ooh! Daddy, are you all right? Yeah, I think so. I... [CHUCKLING] BILLIE: Oh, how did you... [KNOCK AT DOOR] Come in. Hi, Coach. Carol. You were great out there this afternoon. You know, that little story is gonna do us both a lot of good. Well, I'm sorry my father ruined the pole vault. He's a nervous man. [WHIMPERING] Comes from not having the old school spirit. I don't know, sir. It just comes out of being a good father. Um, yeah, that's what I said. Now, look. I want to ask you a question. Yes, sir. Were you putting those reporters on today when you told them about the beat? The thing you hear in your head? No, sir. You mean you actually hear music? And when you speed it up, you can run faster? That's right. Hoo-hoo-hoo. You don't believe me either? I do. I do. I most certainly do. Let me ask you another question. Could you teach that beat to anybody else? I've taught it to all my girlfriends. Can they run? No, sir. They just like to dance. Oh. Well, too bad. The boys. Could you teach it to the boys? Well, sure. If they wanna learn. They'll learn. They'll learn. If I have to take a whip to 'em. When can we start? [GIGGLES] Whenever you like. Tonight. Great. We'll all get together at 8:00. I'll let you know later where. Okay. Coach? Hmm? Could I bring along some of the girls? It might help. If it'll help, you can bring along man-eating tigers. [GROWLING] [DOOR CLOSES]It's just about what some of 'em are. Beat! Beat! ALL: Beat! [MUSIC PLAYING] [ALL CHEERING] [ALL CHEERING] [MUSIC STOPS] [ALL CHEERING] [ALL CHATTERING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I will tell them, darling. Just as soon as I get the chance. No, no, it's not, I'm afraid... It's just that Daddy is very upset right now. Oh, yes. I love you, too. Yeah, I'll see you Saturday. Just as soon as you get in. Oh, yes, dear. Yes. Look, I know, it sounds silly, Howard, but all I can tell you is people are laughing and making jokes. They're falling away from us. Even some of our own workers. You have no idea what it could be? Well, I've got one. Well? Howard, I'm gonna level with you. I think you should pull Billie off that track team. Oh, Matt, that's ridiculous. Well, you asked me. Well, aside from... I just can't do it. It wouldn't be fair. To you or to her? To either of us. And I don't want Billie hearing about this. Can I fix you a drink, Matt? Uh, no, thanks, Jean. I've gotta run. Daddy? No, dear. I'll get my own. Say, uh, by the way, Jean. How about having dinner with me on Friday? Gee, I'd love to, but... Go on, Jean. That's a good idea. Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Well, what do you say? All right, Matt. Oh, great. I'll pick you up around 7:00. See you. See you later, Howie. Yeah, all right, Matt. He's a nice young fellow.Yes. Yes, he is. I'm glad you're going out with him, Friday night. You're a young girl. Plenty of time to play the field. Months. [CHUCKLES] You're funny. [SIGHS] Oh! That reminds me. Bob is coming home on Saturday. That's the wildest non sequitur I ever heard. No. No, it isn't. Playing the field reminded me of track. And track reminded me of traveling. And traveling reminded me that Bob is coming home. Some kind of college holiday? Oh, I guess you might call it that. He's a very sweet boy, Daddy. I hope you'll be nice to him. Well, of course I'll be nice to him. What do you think I am? Some kind of ogre? I'm happy to hear you say that... No, I'm a progressive understanding parent. I just don't think you should be spending that much time with one boy. But, you see... Oh, I'm late. Gotta pick up your mother downtown. Come on, Jean. Okay. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] You know what? What? I've got a confession to make. I didn't like the idea of all those guys paying attention to you, last night. Why? I don't know. I guess, because I like you. I like you, too. And I'm glad we're friends. You are? Mmm-hmm. You know, you're just about the best friend I've got. You're almost like my sister. [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] Hi, darling. Hi, Mom. Have a nice time? Mmm-hmm. We danced. You did? And then Mike held my hand all the way home. I felt strange. In what way? I don't know. Like... A girl. You'll find being a girl is an easy adjustment to make. I like it. Hmm, I'm sure. But I'm glad to be home talking to you. Makes me feel safe. I know exactly what you mean. ♪ I must be growing up ♪ I'd like to run and hide ♪ There's something going on ♪ I'm all mixed up inside ♪ Tonight, he held my hand ♪ And when our fingers touched ♪ I felt butterflies ♪ Funny little butterflies ♪ I wonder if it shows ♪ This strange new way I feel ♪♪ This strange new feeling ♪ That I simply can't conceal ♪ Tonight, he held me tight ♪ And all the while we danced ♪ I felt butterflies ♪ Funny little butterflies ♪ I'm still a little scared ♪ It happened much too fast ♪ I'm still a little lost ♪ Between what's coming ♪ And what's past ♪ I know it's not a dream ♪ It's lasted much too long ♪ Each time I close my eyes ♪ The feeling's still so strong ♪ Tonight, I found it nice ♪ Just to be a girl ♪ And feel butterflies ♪ Funny little butterflies ♪ Inside ♪ [MUSIC PLAYING] Go! Put your hands behind the line. Set. Go! You know, Carol, that's the first time you lost to me. You've got the beat. Yeah, thanks. Carol, don't you feel well? Mmm-mmm. Well, then what's wrong? Nothing, why?You finished second to Mike in every event. You've lost the beat. [HUMMING] But our first meet's Saturday. Mmm-hmm, I'll be there. Hey, Mike. You did great today. You sure got on to the beat. Yeah, Mike. Looks like you're getting a little private tutoring. You know, it doesn't seem right. We're all a team. All for one. And one for all. And I know which one. Come on. Lay off. Lay off. We're just talking about team spirit. I got much more spirit out of dancing than running. You know, it's a mathematical formula, the beat theory. Track plus beat equals girls.Yeah. The beat plus me equals girls. But then again, me plus track equals girls. [BOYS CHUCKLING]So everything comes out girls. Yeah, girls. Yeah, girls.

Hi. Oh, you were great today.Thanks. Something wrong? Billie, I gotta talk to you. About what? About us. Oh, okay. Go ahead. I've decided you gotta do something. Because everybody's making jokes and laughing at me. You want me to hit them? No. I've decided you shouldn't only give up the track team, but you've gotta stop dancing with other boys. That's what you've decided? That's right. I see. In other words, you don't believe in equality. Like my father. Well, sure I believe in equality. But I think you should compete as a girl, not as a boy. Well, if everybody is equal, what difference does it make how I compete? It makes a difference, because men and women are equal, but not the same. If there wasn't any difference, I'd go out on a date with Eddie Davis. What for? I can run faster than he can. Billie, that's not why I like you. Why do you like me? Because you're a girl. And that's why you don't want me to compete against men? Yes! Then you don't think of me as an equal. Well, sure I do. But I think of you as a girl first. Well, I want you to think of me as an equal first. Well, go ahead. Do what you want. I don't wanna talk about it. You don't wanna talk about it, 'cause you know you're wrong. I'm not wrong! Okay. You'll find out tomorrow, when I run you into the ground. Uh, Billie, wait. Billie... [DOG BARKING] Agnes. AGNES: Be right in. Hello, darling. Hi, Daddy. HOWARD: Hello. You're late, even for you. I was detained at the campaign headquarters. Something wrong, Daddy? Oh, no, no. Of course not. Have you seen this? Whoa! Oh, Daddy! Uh, the pictures start on Page 103. There's a whole layout. Oh, isn't this exciting? Oh, ho, it's hysterical. Here it is. JEAN: Oh, what a wonderful picture. AGNES: She should have combed her hair. What's that? Oh, that's a copy of the "women shouldn't compete with men" speech that I made for the girls of the senior class. Oh, dear! You said it. You should have stuck to "keep off the grass." [CHUCKLES] Turn the page. AGNES: Howard! HOWARD: Well, you see when I saw she was pole-vaulting, I thought she was gonna kill herself. And after it was all over, she got up and looked at me and said, "You're better off as a spectator, Daddy." She didn't hurt herself? No, no, no. She got right up and brushed herself off. Well, you didn't hurt yourself? No, some minor cuts and bruises, a sort of a slight giddiness, a lack of focus, of course, and then I had to be carried to the bench for some water. Outside of that, I felt fine. [GIGGLES] Well, you're too old to be catching pole-vaulters, anyway. I'll try to remember that. Yeah, so will 32 million other people who read Lifethis week. Yeah, so that just about laughs away my campaign. JEAN: Why? Well, you don't think that voters are gonna take a clown seriously, do you? Well, there's only one thing to do. When Billie comes home, we'll simply explain the situation to her. No, no. We won't do that. Why? Well, I wouldn't dream of suppressing that child. Now you're being stubborn. No, that is my last word. Tonight, I'm gonna debate Mayor Davis for the second time. I can hardly wait to be regarded as a national laughing shrine. Oh, why couldn't she have been a boy? Come on, now, Howard. No, when Lifecame out, people came screaming into my office doing a snake dance. And then shouting, "Boom-a-lacka, boom-a-lacka, sis-boom-ba, "Howie-Harold, ra-ra-ra! Ah!" [GIGGLES] Oh, I'm sure it was all in fun. [CLOWN WHIMPERING] I think all men stink. [CLOWN GROWLING] HOWARD: Don't retract that statement, because I'm here. I wasn't going to. [DOOR SHUTTING] That's the child you want me to reason with? I couldn't get her off that team with a whip. Well, I wouldn't worry about the campaign. Things always look darkest just before they get totally black. And I say that by his actions, Howard Carol has not only made this town a national laughing place, but he doesn't deserve to be mayor. Because he doesn't know the difference between right and wrong. [CROWD MURMURING ] I don't know what that means, Mr. Mayor. And I further have heard that there are goings-on in the Carol home that are both un-Christian and un-American. [WHINING] HOWARD: If you're talking about my daughter... DAVIS: I'm not and you know it. Well, then what are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about, Howie. How about letting us all in on it, Mayor? [CROWD CLAMORING] All in good time. HOWARD: That's not true, Davis. And I think you're the author of a smear campaign. We'll see, Howie. When are you letting the news out, Charlie? Either before or during our next debate. [CROWD MURMURING] [BARKING] I have never been so angry my whole life. As a matter of fact, I feel like withdrawing from the race. Well, that's exactly what Charlie Davis wants you to do. [BILLIE JUMPING]I know. But of all the dirty... [CLOWN BARKING] Don't play into his hands, Howard. [STAMMERING] You know he's bluffing, then call his bluff. All right. Uh, Billie, would you stop doing that for a little while? Okay, Daddy. It's just that I want to be in the best condition of my life tomorrow. I'll show Mike. Come on, Clown. Charlie Davis just can't push me around and cast false aspersions on my family. [DOORBELL RINGING] I'll get it. It's probably Matt. If they're false aspersions, you have nothing to worry about. I know, my dear. But certainly nobody can believe that a... That a 15-year-old girl running on a boys' track team is un-American or un-Christian. I don't see how. Well... Well, the trouble is... Hi, Jeanie. Bob! What's wrong? You weren't supposed to be here until tomorrow. [STAMMERING] I flew down to see my wife. I thought you'd be happy. Oh, I am. I just haven't been able to break the news of our marriage yet. Oh, Jeanie! Why not? [EXHALING] It's very complicated. Oh, Jeanie, that's silly. Now, look, I'll tell them.Oh, my! No, no. Please! Daddy's having an awful lot of trouble with the election and... I'll explain it all to you later. But, Jeanie, the first thing that we said when we... Bob, come in and promise you won't say a word. Promise! [STAMMERING] Well, Jeanie... Great! Come on in. Mom! Dad! Look who's here! [LAUGHING] Hello, Mr. Carol. Bob!Nice to see you again, sir. Welcome home, Bob. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Carol. How was the trip? [CHUCKLING] Oh, uh, not too bad.Good. Thank you.Bob! Hiya, Bob! Hiya, Billie! How's my girl? Just great. I've been reading about you. You're a national celebrity. [CHUCKLING] Thanks. And I'm happy about you. What are you so happy about? Oh, that Bob flew back for the elections. HOWARD: Oh, uh, some kind of a school holiday? Uh, no, it's not. Then why did you fly back? Well, to be perfectly honest with you, sir... He's public-minded. What? JEAN: Public-minded. [DOORBELL RINGING] I'll get it. [STAMMERING] Oh, yes. I'm public-minded. Um, I'm interested in local politics, and I, uh... I flew home to vote for you in the election. Well, that's fine, Bob. I want to thank you for your loyalty. Oh, it's, uh... It's, uh, nothing. I'll bet. Yeah. Hi, Howie. Agnes. HOWARD: Hi, Matt! You know Bob? Of course. How are you, Bob? Fine. You ready, Jean? I just have to get my purse. Ready for what? Matt and I have a date. Oh. You have a what? JEAN: A date, Robert. Why don't you call me tomorrow? [STAMMERING] Well, I certainly will. [CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY] Well, uh, nice to see you again, Bob. I'll see you tomorrow, Howie. JEAN: Good night, Daddy. Good night, Mom. Uh, we'll be late. Any time you want to bring her back, it's all right with me. Hold it! Hold it! Yes, Bob? Would you and Matt mind dropping me off at the nearest bar? Not at all. Let's go. Agnes, do you think Bob Matthews is behaving all right? Perfectly. I think he behaved rather oddly. I didn't. [CLOWN BARKS] Now, what are you supposed to be doing? [LAUGHING] Jumping for joy. [CLOWN BARKING] [SQUEALING] [LOUD MUSIC PLAYING] You mind if I cut in? Oh, not at all, Bob. What are you doing here? I came to tell you that I think this whole entire situation is ridiculous. And I want you to come home with me right now and tell your father. Oh, Bob, you've got to be patient at least until I can get Daddy by himself and in a good mood. That could be when we're both old and gray. You've got to understand and be reasonable. All right! All right! But the deadline is tomorrow or we forget the whole entire marriage. Okay. I promise I'll tell Daddy right after the track meet. Okay, good. I'll go with you and we'll tell him together. I'm going with Matt. Matt? Isn't this a swell arrangement? You are married to me and you're going steady with Matt! Runners, stand over your marks. [WHINING] Take your marks. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [WHINING] [CROWD CHEERING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] [WHINING] [BARKING] Come on! Get that beat, Mike. [CROWD GROANING] ALL: Billie! Billie! Billie! [BARKING] [INAUDIBLE] [CROWD CHEERING] [BARKING] [DRUM ROLL] ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Billie Carol is awarded the honor athlete of the day! [CROWD CHEERING] [BAND PLAYING] [BARKING] [WHIMPERING] [LAUGHING] There's my little star. Five foot two and a half inches of greased lightning. You were great today, Son. AGNES: Son? MATT: Howie! JEAN: Daddy! Every man must have a dream, and every dream must have a purpose. What's that, dear? Oh, Thomas Jefferson said that. I'm thinking of using it as my theme if I'm elected mayor. The way things are going, I'd advise you to write a concession speech. Yeah, I've already done that. Mom. Daddy. There's something I have to tell you. Yes, darling? And please don't be nice to me, Daddy, or I know I'll cry. Well, what is it? Well, it's, uh... It's sort of about school. Yes?I, uh... I... I know that you don't want me to go back to the school in the East. HOWARD: That's right. And you're not going to. Fine. 'Cause that's not the problem. Well, uh, what is the problem? Howard... Agnes, I'll handle it. Daddy, I know this is going to make you very angry, but I've just got to tell you. Well, then go ahead. I'm... I don't want to go back to school at all. Anywhere. Well, why not? I... I'm interested in other things. And... I'm really not a very good student. [LAUGHING] And you thought I'd be angry at you? Yes, I did. What kind of a parent do you think I am? Oh, well... HOWARD: I'll have you know I'm the most understanding, tolerant man in the world. JEAN: Oh, I'm very glad to hear that. And as far as I'm concerned, the only thing that matters, Jeanie, is your happiness. That's marvelous! And as far as I'm concerned, you can have anything that you want in the whole world. Oh, boy, that's good news. Why is that such good news? Because Bob and Jeanie are gonna have a baby. Well, that's... A baby? A baby? Congratulations. "Congratulations"? What are you talking about? Daddy, please let me explain. Explain? What is there to explain? Howard, now... Well, nobody ever explained to me what you were majoring in at college, but somebody should have told me that it was sex. AGNES: Oh, now listen... Well, I don't know why I sent her away and spent all that money, when she could have done the same thing right here at home and much cheaper. Howard! Hello, Mr. Carol, Mrs. Carol! Well, has Jeanie told you the good news? She certainly has. Public-minded citizen! Daddy! Oh, Daddy! Well, what do you expect me to do? Bob and I are married. We have been for almost a year. What? Well, why didn't you tell me? You didn't give me a chance. Oh, I'm sorry, darling. Oh, I know you'll be very happy. Oh, thank you, Daddy. Isn't it nice to know that you have such an understanding father? Thank you, Mom. Uh, if I could just explain something to you... Congratulations, Bob! I'm happy for both of you. [STAMMERING] Well, if you don't mind me saying so, sir, you have an odd way of showing it. [ALL LAUGHING] It's the left. I'm sorry. HOWARD: Ladies and gentlemen, since this is the night before election and the Mayor has promised us some graphic news, I am going to turn the platform over to him. Mayor? [CROWD CLAPPING] I don't like to say this, because I'm a good Christian man. But the truth is, it is come to my knowledge that Mr. Carol's daughter Jean is going to have a baby. [CROWD MURMURING] Ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor is absolutely right. I don't know why he doesn't like to say it, unless he's not much of a man. Or unless he's not of the 20th century. Since my daughter Jean is and has been married to Bob Matthews, a distinguished member of this community and soon to be a partner in my law firm. Jean, Bob, will you stand up? [CROWD CLAPPING] MAN: Hold it.[CAMERA CLICKS] Good. [CROWD CLAPPING] Mr. Carol? Yes. Now that Mayor Davis has conceded, do you have any statement to make? Well, yes, uh... Now that it's all over, I do have something that I'd like to say. First of all, it was a dirty fight. I don't think that Charlie Davis deserves to hold public office. I don't believe in being hypocritical. I'm glad that I won and I'm glad that he lost. [CROWD MURMURING] [WHINING] How come you're not dressed? [GRUNTING] I'm not going, Daddy. Wait a minute, Billie. You're not going to my victory dinner? What's the matter? Nothing. Oh, sure there is. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, you can tell me. It's, uh, secret time, huh? I don't know, Daddy. I just feel kind of funny and unhappy. Well, all kids go through that. It's a little thing called growing pains. Daddy?Hmm? Would you take me to the victory dinner tonight? I'd like to get dressed up and have a date. Darling, I'd be honored. Thank you, Daddy. I won't be long. I'll be right down. Billie, this is a house, not a high jump. I'm sorry, Mom. Better. Is the speech gonna be very long tonight? No, I thought I'd be very eloquent, but very terse. [DOORBELL RINGING] After that victory statement, I'd say the terser the better. Hi, Mike. Come on in. Ah, thank you, Mrs. Carol. Oh, hi, Mr. Carol. Hello. Hello, there, Mike. Is Billie at home? She's upstairs. I'll tell her you're here. Wait a minute, Agnes. I... I wanna talk to Mike first. Well, Howard, it's getting awfully late... No, it won't take long. Well, if you gentlemen would excuse me now, I'm gonna stick my head in the oven. Mike, sit down. Thank you, sir. Billie hasn't been very happy the last couple of days. I wonder if you could tell me why? Well, I don't know, sir. Unless it's because of the fight we had. About what? I wanted her to get off the track team. She refused? [CHUCKLES] She certainly did. Then, uh, what brings you here tonight? Well, Mr. Carol, I've come to ask Billie to the victory dinner and dance tonight. And, in so doing, you thought you'd get back in her good graces? Yes, sir. How? Well, I've got a whole speech planned. Billie, this is not the time to be emotional... Mike, uh, I don't want to hear the whole speech. Well, its main theme is, uh, reason and logic. Would you, uh, sit down again? Okay. I'm gonna give you some advice from my own rich personal experience. In dealing with women, a man must shun reason and logic. Time has shown that the male of the species has never been able to turn these two weapons to his own advantage. Well, uh, what weapons should I use, sir? Confusion. In 20 years of married life, I have confused more issues than a reactionary. And I have emerged victor over reason, logic and my wife 40% of the time. I think. You mean, I should try to confuse Billie? Uh, no, I don't think you better try that on Billie. Well, if I can't use reason or logic, and I can't use confusion... Well, what's left? Action! Action and dedication. A woman of 15 is impressed with shining knights and holy grails. At 18, they smile indulgently at growing boys. And when she reaches my wife's age, she laughs openly. No, if you're gonna win Billie back, you've gotta prove that you're willing to fight for her. Well, I'm not a fighter, sir. You can't ask her to that dance. You've got to tell her she's going with you. [CHUCKLES] She'd kill me. No, you've got to be strong and dominant. And, in so doing, you've got to let her know that no matter what she does or is, she's still your girl. No, sir. I'm sorry. I disagree with you. You do? Yes. We have never had to resort to intrigue. Our relationship has been much more mature than that. All right, then. You're the victim. I'll call her and tell her. Billie! BILLIE: Yes, Daddy? Will you come down a minute?BILLIE: Okay. I'll be on the porch listening, in case you have a few last words for posterity. [CHUCKLES] Okay, Daddy, I'm... Hi, Billie. What do you want? Well, I, uh... I came to ask you to the dance tonight. You did? Well, no, thank you. Well, why not? Because you're just like every other man, Mike. You're not big enough in character to accept me as a real equal. Billie, this is not the time to be emotional... Don't interrupt! It's all your fault I'm not accepted as a girl. My fault? That's right. If you hadn't been so petty and narrow-minded, you'd have taken me out and said to everybody, "This is my girl." Yes, my girl, the track star. Why not? Because people laugh. And you're afraid they're laughing at you. Mike, you're a coward. That's not true. Yes, it is. You're passive instead of active and I don't want to see you again. Now, hold it! BILLIE: Are you talking to me? MIKE: That's right. Have you finished what you had to say? Just about. Good. Because I have something to tell you. Go ahead. You were right and I was wrong. And as far as I'm concerned, you can do whatever you want. You're not my equal. You're my better. Good night. Hold it. Listen, you, aren't you going to ask me to go to the dance? I did ask you. Would you ask me again? All right. Do you wanna go to the dance with me tonight? Sure. [LAUGHS] Let's go. Uh, don't you think we ought to tell your mother and father? No, they'll never miss me. HOWARD: Just a minute. Agnes. Daddy, I didn't know you were out there. [LAUGHS] Obviously. AGNES: All clear? Oh! Look, Mom. I got a real live date. Oh, wonderful. Well, uh, we'll see you later, Mrs. Carol. Okay. Bye. Thanks, Dad. It's all right, son. Let's go, Billie. Okay. See you later, Daddy. AGNES: Have a good time. I will. [SLOW MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] Congratulations, Mr. Mayor. Oh, thank you, thank you very much. Daddy, I wanted to tell you, your speech was just wonderful. And I wanna tell you that you're a very pretty little girl. [LAUGHS] Thank you. And I also want to tell you that up until tonight I've been very wrong about some things. What? You and me. What do you mean? You know, back at the house when you said to Mike, "You're just like every other man," you meant me, didn't you? Oh, no, I didn't. Yes, you did. I understand. I'm gonna be a much better friend in the future. Daddy, may I tell you a secret? Yeah, yeah, sure. [EXHALING SHARPLY] Being a girl is so much fun, I've decided to give up track. [CHUCKLING] Is that what you want? Mmm-hmm. That's what you should do. May I always tell you my secrets? Billie, I hope you will, but I know you won't. Why not? Well, because tonight I'm the man you love. One of these days, I'll just be your father. [CHUCKLES] I don't understand. You will. [MOUTHING] Shall we change partners, sir? Oh, yes. Yes, sure. Why don't we sit this one out? Okay. I'm tired. How about a little punch?Mmm-hmm. Well, have you given up Jeanie? Now what do you mean by that? You were looking at Billie so soulfully, I figured you found yourself a whole new girl. Now, you know, that you are my only girl. Hmm? So did you know that, uh, Billie is giving up track? No, but that's funny, 'cause so is Mike. Mike? Poor male of the species. Darling, you sound so sad. Well, I am. Why? Well, Jeanie is married. She'll be leaving home soon. Billie is no longer a little girl. She'll only be with us a few more years and... And I'm going to become a grandfather. [CHUCKLING] Well, look at it this way. You're not losing a daughter, you're gaining a law partner. You're not losing a track star, you're gaining a daughter. You're not only going to be a grandfather, but also mayor of the town. You're also gonna become a father again. [CHUCKLING] I'm gonna have a baby. [STAMMERING] A baby? [LAUGHING] Yeah. You mean, this whole mess is gonna start all over again? That's right. [CHUCKLING] Oh, I'll never survive it. Of course you will. Besides, maybe this time it'll be a boy.
