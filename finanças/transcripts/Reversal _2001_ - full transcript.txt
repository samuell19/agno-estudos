[soft melodic music] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] - [Ed] Tomorrow, there'll be a lot of teams here, a lot of tough wrestlers. You guys are tougher. You've worked really hard, you've sacrificed a lot. You're a great team, best I've ever had. But when I look at you guys, I don't see wrestlers, I don't even see winners, I see something better, I see men and you know why I say that? 'Cause every one of you in this room has got a fighter's heart. Who knows what that means? Leo? - Do your best every day. - That's right, do your best every day all the time. I'm not just talking about practice, I mean, listening to your mother, do your homework, feed the dog or take out the trash, see what you have to do and then do it, especially if you don't like it. Now, can you guys do that? - [Kids] Yeah. - What was that? It sounds like a bunch of mice in here. I said, can you guys do that? - [Kids] Yes! - All right, that's what I thought. Okay, let's go over reversals, all right. What do you want? Huh? [laughing] Come here. Okay, remember when the man's on top, he's in control, right? You gotta reverse him, turn him around as quick as you can. Go ahead, Leo. Grab the wrist, lean up, lean up. There you go. Good job, that's the two, boys. Now when you're out on that mat, remember it's a different world, guys, out on the mat, doesn't matter what your last name is, what school you go to or if your feet stink, all that matters is what you've got and what you do with it when it counts. Roger, don't let that little pipsqueak get away. Good job, pipsqueak. All right, come on, guys, hold that man down, guy on top, guy on bottom, show me it's nothing, come on. Come on, Alex, this is wrestling, the way you're gonna train is the way you're gonna fight. Come on. - Thanks. - There you go, there you go, that's better, that's better. All right, come on, keep moving, keep moving. [whistle tooting] Huddle up, let's go. [feet pattering] [kids groaning] Okay, guys, remember, weigh-in's tomorrow at nine, right? - Yeah. - Mm-hm. - Remember what we've worked so hard for? - Yes. - Pay off's that championship. Okay, guys, close your eyes. Visualize the win, you see it? - Yeah. - I see it. - You're on that mat, your hands are being raised in triumph, you did it. We did it, that big trophy. Break, team! - Team! - 46 and a half, you're a pound and a half over, dude. What do you wanna do? Good for you, Leo, that's the spirit. Practice like a champion. [suit rustling] [tape tearing] So who's your favorite band? - Aerosmith. [tape tearing] - [Ed] What do you think your opponents are doing right now? - What's that mean, Dad? - The guys you're gonna beat on Saturday, what do you think they're doing? - I don't know. - [Ed] Well, guess. - Playing with their toys or at the park. - You're probably right. Come Saturday, all they're gonna do is lose. You know why? - Why? - Because you worked harder. [tape tearing] [soft melodic music] Hard work always pays off, Leo. Knees up higher, higher! [feet pattering] [whistle tooting] [soft melodic music] [feet pattering] [whistle tooting] [soft melodic music] [feet pattering] Up, come on. Come on, let's go, let's get those knees up, let's go. Up, up, up, higher. [whistle tooting] 19, we got it. 20, one more? 21, keep going, keep going, keep going. 22, come on, for the last match, for the last match, 23. 18, 19, 20, one more, let's go. 21, squeeze another. 22. Five, four, three, two, one, good man. Let's get outta here. [hands slapping] We're almost there, dude. You don't eat or drink anything, we'll float what, a pound, a pound and a quarter overnight? - A pound. - You'll float a pound? That's great, if Mom asks, what do we say? - Already ate. - Don't wanna upset her, do we? - No, we don't. - You tired? - Nope. - I'll race you to the car. - Okay. [soft orchestral music] I won! - You did. [car door clicking] Get in there. [car door thudding] [car engine starting] [car rumbling] [tires screeching] [soft orchestral music] [car rumbling quietly] [soft orchestral music] [car door thudding] [car door clicking] [soft orchestral music] [Ed kisses Leo] [soft orchestral music] [car door thudding] [no audio] [door clicking] [door thudding] [door creaking] [Ed groaning softly] [shoes thudding quietly] I know you're awake. Come on, aren't you gonna help me out here, huh? [Ed groaning softly] What the heck is that, is that a tarantula? - Uh! [hand slapping] - Got him. Don't ever give up, never quit. Why do you do that? - What? - [Ed] Pretend to be asleep. - Because I like it when you carry me. - I like it too. Who's your best friend? - You are, Dad and I'm gonna try really hard to win that trophy for you. - You don't do it for me, silly, you do it for yourself. - [Leo] Why? - Why? Because I won't be able to carry you forever, that's why. Now get some sleep. [Ed kisses Leo] [Jessica breathing softly] [Jessica breathing softly continues] [Jessica breathing softly continues] [refrigerator door clicking] [refrigerator door thudding] [soda sloshing] [soda sloshing] [Leo spitting soda out] Way to go, I am so proud of you. The world's better for winners, you know that? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - You get respect, people admire you, you can do anything you want, you can even be anything you want, how's that sound? - Cool. - With that trophy, you're gonna get your proof of that. Every time you look at it, it's gonna remind you, that you can do anything you put your mind to. You can be a winner, you know that? - Mm-hm. - We gotta get up at five, that's in two hours, let's hit the sack. [hands slapping] [mellow melodic music] [car rumbling quietly] [mellow melodic music] [car door thudding] [car door clicking] Hey. [car door thudding] Today's your first tournament, are you scared? - Uh-uh. - Not even a little bit? - Uh-uh. - You oughta be. What happened to your shoe? - I untied it. - You untied it? Up to now, it's all been fun and games, huh? - Ah-huh. - Goofing off, wrestling around with your buddies. But today you're gonna have to fight a bunch of strangers. We don't like strangers, huh? - Uh-uh. - They don't care about you, they're not even your friends. They wanna beat you, embarrass you, even hurt you if they can. So when you're out on that mat, you gotta be tough, you hear me? - Ah-huh. - You gotta change, out on the mat, you gotta despise your opponent. - What's despise mean, Dad? - Despise means you gotta kind of hate the guy. - Why do I have to hate him, Dad? - 'Cause he's the only thing standing between you and a better life. [hands slapping] Let's go run it. [mellow melodic music] [mellow melodic music continues] [mellow melodic music continues] [crowd shouting] [whistle tooting] [crowd shouting] [crowd shouting continues] That's it, that's it, go! Come on, that's it, that's it, go! That's it, that's it, go! [crowd shouting] [whistle tooting] Yeah! [crowd cheering] [whistle tooting] [crowd shouting] [crowd shouting continues] [whistle tooting] Turn over! [crowd shouting] - Two! - One ahead, two. [crowd shouting] [whistle tooting] [crowd cheering] [crowd shouting] [crowd applauding] [crowd shouting] [whistle tooting] [crowd applauding and cheering] - [Referee] Shake hands. [crowd applauding and cheering continues] - Yeah! - All right! [group applauding] [group applauding continues] [no audio] [no audio] Here, Jessica. Let me get it. - Here you go, baby. - Is it okay? - Sure, it's okay. Who wants some cake? - [Kids] Me! - [Ed] He ate cake, he ate pizza. - [Jessica] He had to ask you, if he could have a piece of cake - He didn't have to. - What's up with that? - [Ed] He didn't have to ask me for any cake. - [Jessica] Silly, he can't even have any. - What are you talking about? - The cake. - [Ed] He didn't have to ask me to have any cake. - Yes, he did. - No, he didn't. - [Jessica] It's alright to gain weight. - [Ed] He did not say it was alright. - [Jessica] Oh, you control everything. [mellow upbeat music] [mellow upbeat music continues] [mellow upbeat music continues] [mellow upbeat music continues] [mellow upbeat music continues] [shower pattering] [skipping rope whirring] [crowd shouting] [wrestlers thudding] [crowd shouting] [crowd shouting continues] - Squeeze! [whistle tooting] [crowd applauding and cheering] [crowd applauding and cheering continues] [crowd applauding and cheering continues] [melodic rock music] [car horns tooting] [melodic rock music] - Hey, break it up, break it up, we don't need this here. And you, this ain't the first time I've seen you pulling this shit, next time, you're gonna deal with me, now get out here. You alright, man? - Yeah, bro. - Next time, you know what I'm saying, alright? [both giggling] - He was out of control. - Who was he with? - I don't know. - Everyone? [laughing] - Did I see Jeff? - Jeff was there. [background rock music] - Man, you're getting slow. - Everyone has place first open, people stood in line for hours to get here. - Four, Coach took the whole team opening day, it was nuts. You remember, Leo? Man, you got it bad, don't you? - Shut up, man. - When are you gonna talk to her? Look, just go up to her and say, "Hi, my name's Leo and no, I don't expect to be this ugly my whole life." [all laughing] Hey, I'm just kidding, man, she's just a chick. Your district champ, ask her out. Just go up to her and ask her to go for a walk. - Are you kidding me, dude, a walk? [all laughing] You're such a fag. So you wanna go for a walk or something? - A walk? - I know it sounds dumb, but I don't have a car, so. - It doesn't sound dumb, not at all. I would love to go for a walk with you. - Great. - Do you mean right now? - Yeah, let's go, sure. [both laughing] - So why'd you ask me out anyways? - What are you talking about, why wouldn't I ask you out? - Well, I don't know, you're just like the nice-looking jock type with cute cheerleader, I don't seem like I'm your type. - I really don't have a type, to tell you this truth, I mean, not- - Come here. [Leo laughing] You're gonna tell me that that's not your type? - [Leo] Not at all, what, a Barbie doll, high maintenance? - She's gorgeous. - are you kidding me? I don't have that kind of money. - High maintenance, that's the problem? Okay, I'm gonna just stop you right now. You're gonna have a problem finding a woman, who isn't high maintenance, okay. - Oh, really, so I take it you're high maintenance? - I, no, that's why I don't have girlfriends. - Yeah, it looks like I'd- - I can't stand it. Can't stand the attitude. So didn't you just eat? - Yeah, I got a cheat day. - A cheat day? - I can have 15 pounds for a night, so you know. Sure you don't want something? - No, I'm fine. Are you really gonna eat 15 pounds tonight? - Yeah, you know, for the weekends though. Pritch will gain 20, I don't know how he does it. - How is that possible? - Well, you go five days without eating, you know, you work out, you sweat, work out, sweat and about two days before weigh-in, you dehydrate yourself, you know, cut out all the liquids. - You go five days without eating? - Mm-hm. - Why would anybody do that to themselves? - [Leo] I don't know. - I'm sorry, did you want a cigarette? - [Leo] No, that's right. [lighter clicking] What kind of those anyways? - They're imported from England, my dad sends them to me. He teaches English Lit over at Cambridge, that's where I plan on going after I graduate. I wanna write just like my dad. - You write? - Yeah, poetry, a few short stories. - So your dad sends you smokes, huh? - Yeah, it's kind of funny actually, my mom flips out about it, right, throws her tantrum. Then I catch her in the next room smoking them, [laughing] it's ridiculous. Pretty typical of an adult, I guess, say one thing and do the opposite, but I love that woman to death and we're like, we're like this, best friends. - Yeah, you're lucky, you know that? - Yeah, I know, I could tell her anything. This is my favorite part of the day, the night, but it's crazy, 'cause it's morning in England soon, so my dad will call me when he gets up and I'll be going to bed. It's amazing after five years and him being so far away, that we're still so close. - That's cool. - So what about your parents, are they together? - They coexist, live in the same house, breathe the same air, that's pretty much it. Pretty close with my dad though, he's a good guy. He's a workaholic, but I can deal with that. [Shaw laughing] But I think he's kind of unhappy though. I think he has serious regrets. - Yeah, don't we all, you didn't say much about your mom. - We're not close. - That's sad. ♪ I've been through all that before ♪ - Why are you bleeding? - Oh, it's no big deal, I get it every once in a while, from pulling all that weight. Kind of embarrassing. [laughing] - No, don't, don't worry about it, I mean, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. So you have a curfew or what? - A curfew, are you kidding? [laughing] I'm sorry, I'm sorry, do you? - I don't have a curfew, I mean, kinda, it is wrestling season and I am training still. How about I walk you home? - Well, I should probably pick up my car, don't you think? - You have a car? - Yeah, my dad got me this old Camaro. - So why were we walking, why don't we go somewhere? - Well, you said you wanted to go for a walk. [birds chirping] [birds chirping continues] [Shaw laughing] - I got it. So how'd you end up in this hick town? - Mom moved us here after her second husband. - This town sucks. - Well, any town sucks if you're miserable. - California doesn't. - California's not a town. Is that where you're headed? - Yeah, eventually. - Yeah, I plan on going back. So what are you gonna do out west? - Well, I got an uncle out there, but I'm going to Oklahoma first on a wrestling scholarship, so. - Really, you must be pretty good then? - [laughing] No, it's not that, you know, the papers say we got one of the toughest districts in the nation, I've won it twice and kinda won it again this year, so. It's not conceited, it's a fact, you know, kinda like it's a fact that you're fine. [Shaw laughing] - You know, I think we should go skinny dipping. - It's too cold. - Shut up and come on, I'm going. - Go ahead. [both laughing] Knock yourself out. [Shaw laughing] - All right, fine, maybe it's a little cold. - Here, take my jacket. - [Shaw] Thanks. [birds chirping] [water gushing] [birds chirping] [water gushing] [car rumbling quietly] [car rumbling quietly continues] [car door thudding] [car rumbling quietly] [cicadas chirping] [Leo knocking] [car door clicking] [car door thudding] [door clicking] [door thudding] - What time is it? - I don't know. - What did you do tonight? You were out pretty late. - Man, we just hung out. - Just hung out? - Yeah, we just went through firsts. - She must be in bed. - [Jessica] There you are. - Hey, hun, what are you doing up? - Waiting, how was your day? - Good, yours? - Well, let's see, I cleaned the kitchen, I scrubbed the toilets, which were filthy. I organized all three closets and I did the grocery shopping. - Great, how are the girls? - When they came home, they went straight to their room, homework, they said. - Are you upset about something here? - You two leave before I wake up, you come home after I go to sleep, I wanted to see my son. Is that all right with you? - Hi, Mom. - Hi, honey, how was your day? - All right. - [Jessica] You look tired, are you hungry? I cooked the meatloaf with the ketchup on top just the way you like it. - [Ed] It's really late, he should go to bed. - [Jessica] It's never too late. - [Ed] We're training, okay. - [Jessica] Which means what, he has to starve himself? - [Ed] You know how important this is. - [Jessica] To who, Ed? - Actually, I am hungry, so. - I left it in the oven on low, I hope it's not dried out. - Are you sure about this? You're gonna have to make this up. - I know, I just don't want her to flip out. - [Jessica] Careful, honey, it's hot. How about a big glass of chocolate milk? - Sure. [spoon clattering] - That does smell good. - There's some leftovers in the fridge. Help yourself. [Leo vomiting] [Leo coughing] [Leo vomiting] [Leo coughing] [Ed breathing heavily] - Coach Leone, working out after hours? [weights clanking] Thurman Ellis, we talked on the phone some weeks ago about transferring my son to this school. - Of course, good to meet you. - We are very happy to be here, this is a great school. Clean wet room, great program. - So you wanna work out? - Yeah, I didn't bring my sweats, but you go ahead. It's an unusual situation, what we have here with my boy and your boy being in the same weight class. You are the coach, I hope that will be not a problem. [weights clanking] - Problem, no, be glad to have your boy here. Are you kidding? - Good. Well, my son wants to wrestle on Friday night. - Your son's entitled to try out for any slot he wants through an elimination match, you know how it works. - So it is a problem? - No, I just have to look at the big picture, I think of the team as a whole. - The big picture is that my son is a state champion and he's the same weight division that your son is in, huh, isn't that what is happening here? - Are you not listening to me here, is this me? 'Cause I'm only gonna say this one more time, I've got to think of the team as a whole, which transcends you, me, Leo and your son. These boys have worked hard all year as a unit, okay, for these seniors, some of them, it's the last match they'll ever have. Every one of these boys are what's important here. - Then we have to have an elimination match, let's do it that way, my son wrestles your son. - You want an elimination match? - Of course, Mr. Leone, my son works very hard, he makes good grades and he's a good boy. It's not his fault that we moved. So I hope you could take that into consideration, that he's in a very delicate situation being a teenager, wanting to be accepted at his new school by his peers and his coach. - What's he weigh right now? - Same as your son, 125 during the season, then drops down to one 119 for sections. - He looks a little small for 125. - He's under, but that's besides the point. - He's under? This is Thurman Ellis, Jr., most of you already know him, for those of you who don't, two times state champion. Tell everybody what it's like to be a state champ. - Yeah, it's an amazing feeling, you know, it's indescribable really. You put so much time and effort into it and for what? Six minutes, but I'm telling you, guys, it's worthwhile. - This is what it's all about, guys, this is the real deal. I'd rather have one state champion in my room than 12 runners up, you can play football, you can play basketball, but you can't play wrestling. - What's next to have no pleasure? - You guys all know how it works around here. The rules are anybody can challenge for a slot on the team, provided their weight's in the ballpark. You also know the winner gets a slot. Johnny, front and center. Can you make 119 by Friday? - Yeah. - I told you my son wrestles 125 during the regular season. - And I told you I gotta do what's best for the team to win on Friday. You ready? - I'm always ready. - How about you? - Let's go. - Roger, you keep time. Guys, spread out, give them the mats. Frank, you take this. - Okay, guys, toes on the line. Shake hands. Ready, Roger? - Ready. [whistle tooting] [feet pattering] [wrestlers grunting] [wrestlers thudding] Two. [wrestlers grunting] One, two. [whistle tooting] - [Johnny] My wrist! [groaning] - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Coach, Coach. - Let me see, where's it hurt? All right, come on, let's get out here. - Coach, I swear it was an accident. - It's okay, come on, let's go. - [Thurman] I'm sorry, Johnny. - 22 seconds. - Ed, you got a second? - No, I don't, can't you see I got a hurt boy? - How's Johnny? - [Ed] He broke his arm. You look puffy, how's your weight? - I haven't checked. - [Ed] Let's check. - I'm dressed. - Get on the scale. [bag thudding] [Leo sighing] [weights clicking] You're four over, what happened? - I don't know. [Leo sighing] - You don't know? - No, I don't know. All this weight, it's not coming off anymore. - Lose because you can't win, not because you can't make weight. You wanna go to Oklahoma or not? - Yeah, I guess. - What do you mean, you guess? - Yeah, it's cool. - We're talking a full boater here, all you can say is you guess? - What are you getting so pissed off about? - Where do I start? You were a quarter pound over at weigh-ins last match, you almost let the whole team down. - I made it. - You always make it. You can't keep working out 20 minutes before every match, you're not gonna have the juice to win, you know that. - I won, okay. - If you don't want Oklahoma, I want to know right now. - Come on, Dad. - No, you come on, you won districts twice, big deal, that means nothing, that's local guys. You get to regionals and states, I've been there, we're talking real wrestlers, that's a whole different world. We're talking about guys who got nothing better to do, but to train five, six hours a day, guys who think like champions two, three, four moves ahead. No, they know what they want, they don't have to guess. You got an opportunity here, don't blow it, you'll be nothing without a college degree. [Leo sighing] - [sighing] What about you? - What about me? You wanna work at the coal fields for the next 20 years? You wanna be stuck in some dead end job, labor job, because you don't have a college education? If that's what you want, quit high school. Is that what you want? - No. - Then you'd better get your shit together and start acting like a champion. If you don't wanna work, quit, but if you're gonna play, you finish, you got it? - Yeah. - What? - Yeah, I got it. - [Ed] Good. [Leo sighing] - Does this have something to do with Ellis Jr.? - What do you mean? - You know what I mean. Everybody knows I should've wrestled him, not Johnny. - Everybody? - Yeah. - You wanna coach the team now? - No, I don't wanna coach the team. - Listen to me, you worry about your weight, I'll worry about the team. You got four pounds to lose, how do you expect to do that? Get in the car, I'm taking you to the Barn. [keys jangling] [drawer thudding] [car rumbling quietly] [birds chirping] [car doors clicking] [car doors thudding] Hey, Jerry. How you doing? - Hi, Eddie, what's up? - Hey, you ever meet my boy, Leo? - Hi, Leo, how are you? - Pretty good. - I wanted to see if he could come train. He's already lost 10, he's got four more, he hit a wall. You know that last four, Jerry. - Hey, that last four is always in your head, son, wished I had a nickel for every pound I've lost, I'd buy a new car. - I'll see you later, Jerry. - Okay, see you. - Thanks. - All right, son, let's get after. Okay, what we do here is we're gonna grab the milk can, we're gonna put it up on the platform, okay? It's a twisting action, you want your hip toward the wall, okay, you got your hip back here, we're gonna reach in, we're gonna get the guy in the leg, we're gonna lift him, I want your extension, I want you extending out high. So we're gonna lift with your legs, lift with your back, you're gonna lift, set the milk can up on top. All right, here we go, lift up. [milk can clanking] Don't worry about coming back down, just grab it, lift, [milk can clanking] twist, back down. Get the extension going. [mellow melodic music] Lift, lift, lift! [milk can clanking] Too slow on the lift. Back with your legs, come on, lift the guy up, he's gonna throw at you, you gotta move him, lift. Okay, grab the bar down here, upper end, get them out, the last joint comes between, up and then down. [weight clanking] Up. [weight clanking] Up. [weight clanking] Up. [weight clanking] Even, even, down even, let's come down here in two hits! Your girlfriend could do better than that, what's the matter with you? [mellow melodic music] Hold. Come on, let's go, let's go! Get your back in there, let's go! Bend your knees, bend your knees, bend your knees! Come on, come on, you wimp, put it up there! Put it up, put it up, get on with it, get on with it! [mellow melodic music] Come on! Pick it up, pick it up! [mellow melodic music] That's it, get up there! - Rough nighters? - Yeah, busy, busy. - [Roger] That sounds like fun. - Chocolate, I see. - [Roger] You gotta have chocolate. - I love chocolate. [packets rustling] - How's your weight? - Whatever. - You get bitched at? - No, I'll lose it. [door clicking] - Is that all? - Yes, that'll be all. - Can get a pack of reds in a box please? - Sure, $3. Mm-hm. - Okay. - Thanks. - So what's up, guys? - Not much, what's up with you? - You ready for the big match tonight, Leo? - Yeah, are you? - [laughing] I don't need to get ready, there ain't a real wrestler within 100 miles of this shithole. You wanna go outside? We can go outside right now. - Let's go. - No, get outta here. - What are you, his guardian angel? - Get out. - Such a little bitch, Leo. [door clicking] - I know you wanted to drop his ass, but save it for later. - Yeah, well. - Pack of Trojans. - Trojans? - What do you suggest? - Well, I don't know, I've never wore one, but I can ask the owner, Mr. Bunhill. - [Roger] No, no, no, no. - What is it, a gift or a party balloon or something? - No, it's ah, ah... - Well, what is it? - It's for you. - For me? - Yeah. - Yeah, well, what size are you? - Extra Large. - [Clerk] Okay, there you go. - Thank you. [bag rustling] - Thanks. - Maybe I'll see you later. - [Clerk] Okay. - Okay. - Okay. [bag rustling] Thanks. - [Leo] Okay. - [Referee] Washington, 119. - Our 19's running late. - Okay, Coach, he has 20 minutes. - You got it. - Trinity, 119. Okay. Okay, name? - Dejohn. - Washington, 125. [weights clicking] Okay, son, you're a quarter pound over. - Go get your sweats on. [shower pattering] [feet tapping] [shower pattering] [feet tapping] You're late. - We are here. - Barely. [shower pattering] [feet tapping] [weights clicking] - 119 and a half. - I thought you were fine. - [Thurman] I was, Coach. [hand slapping] - Hey. - What the hell is wrong with you, huh? - Don't do that, all right, it happens. - Not to me, it doesn't. Go get dressed. - All right, 125. Leone, 125. Good job. - I don't believe it, man, after talking all that shit, he still didn't make weight. - Coming back, man, you know how hard it is. - He's an asshole, serves him right. Don't tell me you feel bad for him? - I don't, I just know it's hard. - You look like shit, man, what are you eating that for? I'm gonna go get you a power bar. [locker door clanging] - It's the last match of the season, guys, okay, this is it for some of you. Payback time for all that hard work, dedication and sacrifice. [soft orchestral music] I want you to keep your heads out there tonight. Don't get distracted, don't psych yourselves out, these guys tie their shoes exact same way you do. I wanna see you go out there and wrestle tonight, you hear me? Remember why you're here, all that hard work, doesn't matter how much weight you've pulled, it's time to take action. I want you to go out there and give your best effort into your own individual match and challenge your teammates to do the same. 110%, I expect no less outta any of you. I wanna see good sportsmanship out there, no showboating. Win or lose, keep your head up. No crying, you're all men. Now huddle up and let's pray. [soft orchestral music] Dear Lord, you know how hard we've worked, you know how much this means to us. We know we're your favorites, so help us this day. Make us as strong as you made David, when he faced old Goliath, inspire us to victory and protect us and our enemies from injury. Amen. - Amen. - [Ed] On three, Prexies, one, two, three. - [All] Prexies! [Leo vomiting] [Leo coughing] - Hey, I told you you should've had a power bar. Yeah, you don't listen to me. Anyways, there's tons of chicks out in the stands, we're gonna get laid tonight, I can feel it. [Leo coughing] Man, you'd better get your head out of the toilet. [crowd shouting] [crowd shouting continues] - [Cheerleaders] T-R-I and N-I-T-Y, go Trinity! T-R-I and N-I-T-Y, go Trinity! [crowd shouting] - Go three, go three! [crowd shouting] Still green. One, two, three, four! [crowd applauding and cheering] [crowd shouting] - [Crowd] Trinity, Trinity, Trinity! Trinity, Trinity, Trinity! Trinity, Trinity, Trinity! [crowd shouting] Trinity, Trinity, Trinity! [crowd shouting] [crowd shouting continues] [buzzer blasting] [crowd applauding and cheering] - Okay, guys, shake hands. [crowd applauding and cheering] [Shaw sighing] - Hey. - How you doing? - Good, how are you? - All right. - You looked really good tonight. - [Leo] No, I sucked. - You won. - I was weak. I think I ate too much before the match. [Shaw laughing softly] - Hey, Leo. Come on, we're gonna miss the bus. - I got a ride. - Don't be out too late. - So what happened with your dad? I thought you weren't coming tonight. - Yeah, I wasn't going to, but he had to give a lecture at Cambridge. - I wish I'd known you were coming. - Why? - I don't know, it's just, you know, if I'd have known, I- - You'd what? - Oh, you know, if I'd known you were there, it'd have given me strength. - Really? - Yeah. - Hey, have you ever gotten high before? - No. - No, [laughs] I would really like to see you stoned. - Yeah, it's just if anybody on the team found out, I could get thrown off. - [Shaw] Would that really be such a bad thing? - Yeah, that's all I care about. - Wow, I feel really sorry for you. - Well, you know, I'm sure I could find at least one other thing I care about. [soft guitar music] What? - I don't know, it's just sometimes, you know, you can be so strong in your mind. You get that from your mom or your dad? - I don't know. - You know, tonight, I was listening in on this conversation, these girls from Trinity, where they were all talking about you. - What did they say? - You know, how cute you are and how they hope you kick this guy's ass, [laughing] which you did, by the way. I don't know, it just kind of made me proud, 'cause you were my boyfriend. - Is that what I am, your boyfriend? - Well, that's how it's shaping up, yeah. [soft guitar music] [cicadas chirping] [train horn blasting in distance] - [Leo] So you come here a lot? - [Shaw] Only when I need a little perspective. - On what? - Life, death, that, that sort of thing. - I'm gonna come by sometime, meet your groovy mom. - Yeah, groovy, baby. [laughing] You know, there's a kegger at Two Mile Run this weekend. - Really? - Yeah, let's go. - I don't know. - Oh, come on. Hey, you know, my mom gave me money to get a hotel room for us. [laughing] - Are you kidding me? - No, I'm serious. She knows everyone's gonna be drinking and everything, she thinks we should just stay the night. - You mean like sleep together? - Come on, wrestling boy, who said anything about sleeping? Show me some of those moves, come on. [laughing] So are we gonna go? - Hell, yeah! [Shaw laughing] [train horn blasting in distance] - You got stuff all over you, come on. - [Jessica] Ed, look who's here. - Hey, Larry. - Hey, Ed. How you doing? - How you doing? - Hey, Uncle Larry. - Is that little Leo? [Leo laughing] Wow, man, you've grown like a weed, boy. - Yeah. - He's here for some radio thing up in Pittsburgh. I told him he could stay with us. - That's great, where's he gonna sleep? [Larry sighing] - [Jessica] Tell everyone all about the radio. Your uncle is number one in Los Angeles again. - Number one what? - DJ, I do a afternoon show on the Mighty Met, KMET. You know what a DJ is? - Yeah. - What? - Someone who plays music. - That's right, you know, it's the number one rock station in the country right now. - It must be a pretty cool job? - Yeah, it's cool, you know, we play a bunch of commercials, but every now and then we get to sneak in a record or two. What kind of music do you like? - Zeppelin, The Doors, The Who. - The Who? - That's right, you like all that old stuff, huh? You know, if parents would just relax and listen to a little Who and the Cheap Trick, then this whole generation gap would be over. - Can I be excused? - No, you may not, eat, your Uncle Larry's here. - It's okay, hun, he doesn't have to eat. - Seriously, Mom, I already ate. - Please just eat a little bit for me? - Jessica, he's in training. - Look at my son, Larry, look at him, he's skin and bones. He's starving to death for some stupid game, that doesn't mean anything to anyone. Tell him what you told me, what you said about wrestling. - Jesse, whoa. - Tell him what you said about sports, how he's teaching my son to become violent and showing him like tribes do. - What are you talking about? - I-I said nothing about tribes, I said, the only thing I said is I'm out of the sports thing a long time ago, you know. I said that the team thing was like tribal warfare, you know, fighting over a little ball in a few yards of grass, it just makes no sense to me, that's all. It's my opinion. - Tell him what you said about how he's teaching my son how to kill. - To kill? - It's passive killing, you know, I mean, the intent is there, the purpose is there. You know that, Ed, to defeat? Come on, it just seems like to me, it's another way to teach our young kids how to kill each other, you know, keep them sharp in case they need them. - To keep who? - Hey, look at the news, man, the only difference between football and war are the uniforms. - And the guns, Larry. - Yeah, and the guns, but a football player had guns and there were landmines in the end zone, then there wouldn't have been a Vietnam. Am I making any sense to you? - No. - No, that's good. [birds chirping] - So Larry, what do you wanna be when you grow up? - [laughs] Ah, a wrestling coach, Ed. [no audio] [birds chirping] What's up, Leo? - Not much. - Is everything okay in there? - [Leo] Yeah. - You want a beer? - Yeah, sure. - Man, if your dad could see you now, he'd kill me. - Why isn't he like you? - Who knows, man, maybe I remind him of too much. - Too much of what? - You know, the past, life, freedom, all that shit he never got. I mean, there's a whole world out there, man. - Yeah, I guess. - [Larry] So why are you doing this? - Doing what? - Wrestling, starving yourself, staying in this town, why? - If I stick it out, I got a scholarship waiting for me at OU. - Then what, I mean, what do you wanna learn? [train horn blasting in distance] Has anybody ever asked you what you wanted, Leo? - I guess I never really thought about it, just figured it was my only way out. - You know your mom and me didn't exactly have a "Leave It to Beaver" home life either. I ran away when I was 16. I was lost for a long time, man, but I turned out. Look, [sighing] what I'm about to tell you, man, I mean, I'll probably never be able to step foot in this house again. Man, you're a good kid and I love you. You got a family situation here, man and you gotta get out. There's a whole world out there, there's nothing here, man. What you need is options and if you, if you got no options, no matter where you turn, it looks good, I mean, even if it's just another trap. You ever need me, you call me. Hell, you could even come to LA, I could get you a little job at the radio station. - You could do that? - I am number one drive time in LA. - Yeah, that sounds cool, radio. - It's just an option, man. Think about it, give it some thought. Man, I'm outta here. - I thought you were staying with us. - Yeah, I got a nice big hotel room in Pittsburgh waiting on me, I ain't staying here, reminds me too much of home. Give me a hug, man. [train horn blasting in distance] Take care. - All right, you too. - Okay. [Leo vomiting] [Leo spitting] [Leo vomiting] [Leo spitting] [Leo coughing] - Okay, guys, regular season's finally over. You guys did a good job, all of you, you should be proud. But now the real work begins, we only got two weeks to train for sections. For you seniors, Leo, Roger, Joey, this is your last shot, this is it, guys. I want everybody to look around the room. No, take a good look. Same time, next month, half your buddies will be gone. The rest of you, the toughest ones, the ones who train the hardest, the ones who sacrifice the most will move on to districts. Out of that, maybe one or two of you will make it to regionals. That's when the college scouts come sniffing around giving you gifts, making promises, that's when the real wrestling starts, guys. [door clicking] But no matter how far any of you guys get, no matter what happens for the rest of your life, you could look in the mirror and say, that you did not fail because you tried. But most importantly, guys, through this whole experience, you'll have the stuff to go out in the world and achieve your goals in life, that's the big picture here, boys. Thanks, you guys are a good team. - My boy has got something to say. - Coach, I just wanted to apologize for the other night at the match. I realize I let everybody down, you, my dad, my team, I even let myself down. I just want you to know it wasn't for a lack of effort, I really tried. I've been working my ass off to get down to weight and I'm growing, I'm getting bigger, it's getting tougher, but I promise you, it won't happen again. - It's okay, sit down with your team. Everybody makes mistakes. - When can we do the elimination match? - [Ed] I don't know. - Any reason why we can't do it now? - No, not today. - Why not? - Because I said so. - Is that a good reason? - This is my mat. I say who gets on my mat and when and with who and why? - You know, I shouldn't be talking to an assistant coach, maybe I need to talk to what's his name? Mr. Blosswell. - You go ahead and talk to Ted, I'll tell you what I tell everybody, you want my job, come and take my mat. - When can we do it? - Monday, that gives them a week. - Fine. - I wasn't talking to you. Is that okay with you? - [Thurman Jr.] It's fine with me, Coach. - How about you? You guys can make weight on Monday? Okay. - Good, good. [door clicking] [door thudding] [mop swishing] [door thudding] - Hey, Leo. [water sloshing] - Why did he call you Assistant Coach? - 'Cause that's what I am. - Who's the Head Coach? - Mr. Blasswell. - English teacher? - Yeah. [soft piano music] [water sloshing] [mop swishing] [soft piano music] The truth is I had to beg him to get that job. I went to school with half of them and it didn't matter. Nobody cares about used-to-bes, that's why I'm always telling you, what you start, you have to finish, Leo. Truth is, I couldn't be Head Coach, no matter how many trophies or state titles I won. - Why? - 'Cause I don't have a college degree. - But Mr. Blasswell hasn't been to a single practice. - And that's how we both like it, I get to coach, he gets the check. - So you don't get paid? - I get something better than money, I get to send my son to college. [soft orchestral music] [soft orchestral music continues] [birds chirping] [background people chattering] - Yeah, I know. [both laughing] - Leo, what's up, man? - What's he doing here? - Oh, we're just having a smoke, that's all. - I wasn't talking to you. - He just bummed a cigarette, it's no big deal. - Oh, really, no big deal, huh? What were you laughing at? - What? - You were laughing at something, what's so funny? Is he a funny guy? - We were you laughing at you, Leo. - Shut up. No, we weren't. - Yeah, yeah, we were, we were talking about what a little pussy you are, you know, Daddy's little boy, all that shit. - Really? - No, that's right. - No, stop. Stop it, just go, please. - First your daddy saves your ass, now your girlfriend. One day, you're gonna have to learn how to fight your own battles and I promise you, I'll be there when you do you. - You know what? - You'd better be. - Go, please. - No, no, no, it's fine, it's fine, we'll finish it later. Don't worry about it. - [Shaw] Stop. - You shouldn't have done that. - Done what, Leo, what did I do? - You know what you did, I don't need your help, alright. - You need somebody's help. Look at you, you look like shit. What'd you eat today? - Breakfast. - [Shaw] What did you have? - Stuff. - What kind of stuff? - I don't know, who cares? - You don't know? [sighing] What? What? - I don't know, just, [sighing]. Forget it, who cares? Don't worry about it. - Tell me. - I don't know, it's just, you know, I dreamed this, you know. - What, this? - Yeah, this, this fighting, you know, this fighting in the halls. You know what I mean? It's just- - [Shaw] No, Leo, I don't know what you mean. - I dreamed of me and you, we were a couple and just keep on fighting and bickering, you know. - I don't get it. - [Leo] You don't get what? - I mean, I get it, why weren't you imagining us in the back seat of your dad's car or something? I mean, why fighting? - I don't know, I guess, I just, I mean, if we were fighting, it means I care about you, you know. - You're truly weird, do you know that? - Really? - Yes, really. - It's only five pounds. You still wanna quit? [Leo sighing] I'm really proud of you. I mean that. - I can't get it off anymore. - Sure you can. This is what it takes to be a champion. - What if I don't wanna be a champion? - What kind of question is that? You might as well ask yourself, what if you don't wanna breathe? Come on, that's fear talking, that's a quitter's question. Four more years and your future's wide open, you can't quit now. What do you wanna do, do you wanna quit? If there was a shortcut, we'd take it, this is the only way I know. I'm sorry. It's only five pounds. [river gushing] - Dad phoned last night, he says, "Hi." You know, I talk about you so much, it's like he already knows you already. He said the summer after graduation, he might fly us out to visit him. - [Leo] That'd be cool. - Yeah, I'm gonna travel after graduation. I'm pretty sure that's why my dad's so smart, I mean, he's experienced every culture, you know, been on every continent. Hey, are you okay? - Look, Shaw, I can't take you to that keg party tonight. - What? - I gotta train. - All weekend? - 'Cause I have to lose five more pounds and I only have two and a half days. - Leo, what about our night together? You know, sharing the same bed for the first time, waking up to a new day just the two of us. - Look, I wanna be with you, okay, I really do, just not tonight. - You know, I really can't believe this. - I'm sorry, Shaw. These new weight classes, it's getting harder. - So we won't eat or drink anything, I mean, we'll just hang out, the two of us. - I'm not gonna have the time, I've gotta train day and night, okay. There's gonna be other nights. - Yeah, maybe there won't. - What's that supposed to mean? - Okay, so then you beat him, right, then what? Then it's two more months of starving. Then it's four years of college wrestling, which is four more years, Leo, that's four more years of starving and denying yourself of everything. How can you live like that? You know, it's like a sickness. - I can quit any time I want. - Right. You know, that's what my mom says about her drinking. You know, you're always talking about what you have to do, it's never what you wanna do. What do you wanna do? I mean, what do you really want? - I want you. - Prove it to me, come, please. - Come on, Shaw, don't do this to me. [river gushing] - You know, Leo, I love you, okay, I really do, but you don't have time for me. You don't even have time for yourself. You're too busy trying to be your dad's hero. Call me when you stop training and start living. [river gushing] [mellow melodic music] - [Jerry] You can do this thing, heck, I've done it, your dad's done it, it's simple. Your body is 90% water, so there's a lot of water in there, look how fat you are. Once you drop that water weight, your body's gonna go through a period of adjustment, you'll settle down, you're gonna get a burst of energy from that adjustment. That energy is gonna go in to repair and rebuild, you're gonna steal that energy just like robbing a bank. It's simple, it all has to do with timing, timing is everything. Don't lift any weights now, you don't have the time and it isn't gonna do you any good anyway. What you gotta do is run, sweat, drink a little water, run, sweat, drink a little water, run, sweat, weigh-in. No sugar, no junk food. 20 minutes before your match, you take two tablespoons of honey, glass of Gatorade, a little glucose. When that honey and that juice hits your bloodstream, your cells are gonna come alive, energize, all vying for sustenance, that's when you're gonna rob the bank. You're gonna get six minutes of energy, enough to take the mat. Don't cut any corners on this thing, you listen to me here now, Leo, there's no shortcuts.

[police radio broadcasting quietly] - So how you doing? [no audio] All that losing weight, you pushed it a little bit too far. [door clicking] - Hey, Leo, how are you feeling? - Okay. - Okay is good, that's good. - So how is he? - Well, let's see, hypovolemia, hypochloremia, gastritis, subsequent idiosyncratic cardiac arrhythmia. Otherwise he's a healthy kid. You know what any of this means? Your son is starving himself to death, he's dehydrated, that's why he passed out. It's just his body's way of letting us know that something worse is getting ready to happen. Next, he'll lose his hair, lose his teeth, we might have to remove a section of his bowel, he'll have a colostomy bag to remove his waste. Then one day, he'll have a heart attack or he'll just stop breathing. I ah, found this in his pocket. - What is it? - It's a laxative, he's been taking it to lose weight. Without any food in his system, he's been evacuating part of his stomach lining, this could cause permanent damage. - What is this? Look at me. Pulling weight's done one way, through training, you know that, it's not about cutting corners. You know better, you're a Leone, we don't do it this way. You looking for the easy way out, is that it? This isn't training, it's cheating. Okay, you gotta cheat, you quit. If you don't wanna work for it, you don't wanna earn it the right way, you don't deserve it, you hear me? - Look, he needs his rest. Let's take this outside, come on.

I'm gonna go for a walk. - I feel bad about everything that you're going through, I really do. I figured it'd all be worth it, all that hard work, anything to get out of this place, go for your dreams. - My dreams got killed in the car wreck, Dad. Her name was Shaw Ashland. You never even met her. - I know. - I should have been with her. I wanted to be with her. I still do. - Don't say that. You'll get through this, take a little time is all, time heals everything, you're a strong kid, you are, you're- - I'm what, Dad, a winner? A champion like you? Well, if this is what it feels like, if this is what it takes, I hate it. Look, I don't know what I want in life, but I know what I don't want. I don't want some crazy woman telling me when to jump and how high, I don't wanna have to sit in my piece of shit car for an hour every night, 'cause I'm afraid to go into my own house. I don't wanna be embarrassed by my family. I couldn't live like that, Dad. I don't know how you do. I don't wanna be like you, Dad. [soft melodic music] [Ed inhaling deeply] [soft melodic music] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] [soft melodic music continues] [birds chirping] - [Jerry] Hey, hey, Leo, how you doing? - Good. - What are you doing here? - [Leo] I gotta get down to 119. - You gonna wrestle Ellis? - Yeah. - [Jerry] All right, how much you weigh? - 28. - How much time we got? - [Leo] Five days. - Nine pounds, five days, piece of cake. You remember Jeremy Hunter? Pulled more weight than any kid we've ever had here. Okay, if he can do it, you can do it, we're gonna pull you all the way down. You're gonna have enough juice in the end to win, okay. Don't let it scare you, you may think you're gonna die, you may wish you were dead, okay. Your vision may go out on you, you're probably gonna get super weak, you may not even be able to grip, okay. Don't let that bother you, don't you pass out on that mat, don't fall down, you listen to your Dad, you'll be able to hear, get to the corner, get off the mat and get inside the locker room, get some water, chew some ice, sit down and calm down, 'cause you're probably gonna shake like a leaf, okay. Believe me, you may get uncontrollable, don't panic, normal. Okay, it happens, but you'll make it, you're gonna live, you hear me, you're gonna live, maybe. Get up that rope, let's see what you got. Come on, hand over hand, tough guy, huh? [car rumbling quietly] [construction machinery rumbling quietly] [car door thudding] [construction machinery rumbling quietly] - Hi. Is this 104 Prospect? - It's 104. - [Leo] Miss Ashland? - Who are you? - I'm Leo. I was a friend of Shaw's. - Oh. Hi. - I just came by to say I'm sorry. - You knew her well? - Yeah. - I didn't, at least not in the last five years. I don't know, ever since her dad died. - Her dad died? - Come here. Can you tell me who Shaw was? Can you just tell me about her? - She's beautiful. Sweet. Fragile. Yeah, she really cared about people and she put you first. She taught me a lot. She taught me to take life not so seriously. She's a free spirit. - Yeah, she was, she was a free spirit. So was her dad. Did she have a lot of friends? - Everybody loved her. - Yeah? How'd she do in school? - Straight A's. [Mrs. Ashland laughing] - Straight A's? I didn't know that. [laughing] [Mrs. Ashland sobbing] You loved her, didn't you? - I still do. - Yeah. [sobbing] [soft melodic music] [soft melodic music continues] - If there's anything I can do, just get in touch.

First place, 45 pounds. You win one of these, huge pizza party with all your friends. You even get your picture in the paper, how's that sound? - Good. - That's your trophy. You want it? - Mm-hm. - Yeah. You wanna see second place? - Yeah. - Yeah? [soft melodic music] What do you think, which one do you want? [melodic orchestral music] [melodic orchestral music continues] [melodic orchestral music continues] [melodic orchestral music continues] [melodic orchestral music continues] [melodic orchestral music continues] 119. [weights clicking] 117. [background people chattering] Hey, Ted, how you doing? Ted, I don't know if you met Thurman Ellis Sr.? - Ted Blasswell, of course, how are you doing? - You too, I'm sorry I didn't catch your last name. - Oh, Thurman Ellis. - Ellis. - We met at a PTA meeting a couple of weeks ago. - Yes, of course. - I thought Ted should be here, so there's no misunderstandings. - Oh yeah, that's fine with us. - Great, you wanna referee, Coach? - No, Coach Leone, be my guest. - You got it. All right, guys, let's clear the mats. Leo, Ellis, come on. You guys know the gig, three two-minute periods. Frank, keep score time for me. Okay, guys, shake hands. [whistle tooting] [feet pattering] [wrestlers grunting] [wrestlers grunting] Two. [feet pattering] [wrestlers grunting] [feet pattering] [wrestlers grunting] [wrestlers breathing heavily] [feet pattering] [wrestlers grunting] [wrestlers grunting] Two. [feet pattering] [wrestlers grunting] [wrestlers grunting] Two. One, two, three, two, near fall. [feet pattering] [wrestlers grunting] [wrestlers grunting] [wrestlers grunting] [feet pattering] [wrestlers grunting] [feet pattering] [wrestlers grunting] [soft orchestral music] [whistle tooting] - Way to go, bro. [soft orchestral music] - Okay, come here, guys, shake hands. - It's all yours, man, take it. - I don't want it anymore. You can have it. - [Ed] What did you say? - My heart's not in it anymore, Dad. [soft orchestral music] [soft orchestral music continues] [door clicking] [door thudding] - Morning. - Good morning. - Where'd you get the milk? - Stole it from the Reinhardt's - You stole it? - I've been stealing it for years. No offense, but I can't stand that powdered shit you always buy. - So how you doing, you all right? - Shaw told me her mom knew all about me, that she wanted to meet me. She told me a lot of things, they were all lies. Why do people who are supposed to love each other always have to hurt each other? [chair creaking] [Ed sighing] [milk pouring] - They don't do it on purpose, not even the worst ones, not even your mother. I think it's the only way they've got to show you they hurt. You know, I went out with your mother for over a year before I ever met her parents. One Valentine's Day, when I was still in high school, I drove over to her house, she lived right over there on Bissol Avenue. Got some flowers, knocked on her door, nobody answered, so I went around back and there she was, in the backyard, crying. Her mother had beat her with the garden hose, then hit her in the head with the brass nozzle in. - Why? - For not making homecoming court. - What did you do? - I took her in and 10 months later, we had a kid and it was you. - Do you love her? - [Ed] I guess, I think so. - Why don't you leave? - Because of you, because of the girls, because I'm Catholic, I don't wanna burn in hell maybe, I don't know. - How do you put up with it? - You know, I may be a lot of things in your eyes, but I'm not a quitter. She's a good person, she is, she just needs help, that's all. [envelope rustling] [chair creaking] - What's this? - It's an airline ticket to Los Angeles. I want you to go stay with your Uncle Larry. I want you to get out of here while you can. - Where'd you get the ticket? - I borrowed the money from JD over at the plant. It's time for you to do what's in your heart, not what's in mine. - I wanna stay here, with you. [chair creaking] - I'd love you to, but it's, you gotta go find your own way. [gentle melodic music] Did you know my father never saw me wrestle? Every time I won, the ref would raise my hand, I'd look out in the stands and see if he was there, but he never was. He didn't even know I won states, 'til your Grandma showed him the newspaper the next morning. He never said a word about it. He was a good man, he just never really encouraged me to do anything with my life, you know. I always thought that if he'd been there to encourage me, maybe my life would've turned out a whole lot different, you know. [gentle melodic music] It's funny, you know, when you're younger, you always promise yourself that things will be different for your kids. All you do is make a whole new set of mistakes. I guess I pushed you probably a little too hard, so that you'd go out in the world and push yourself, so you'd make something of yourself. I just want you to know that I did the best I could and I'm sorry.

You grew up on me. In all that time we were together, all those matches, all those trophies, all that winning, I have never, ever been as proud as I am for what you're doing right now. Good luck out there. Don't forget about me, you hear me? Get outta here. - I love you, Dad. - I love you more, son. I've always loved you, you're my boy. You go out there and show the world what a Washington, Pennsylvania kid can do and go make your own mistakes. Just try to learn from some of mine. - Okay.
