(gentle flute music) (rousing music) - There's no doubt Scotland's a bonny country, but when I was a lad it was a dangerous one. That was early in the 18th century, just after the English put George I on the throne and the Stuarts lost their crown forever. Nobleman fought each other to win the new Kings favor. And brigands roamed the countryside, ready to take your money or your life, or both. (ominous music) But let me introduce myself. I'm Colin MacAllister, that's me there. The handsome young fellow playing the chanter. (gentle flute music) That's my sister Una. She's not too bad. What a girl. And that's Loch Lomond you can see over there. (Una and Colin laughing) - (chuckling) Just look at them, two wee bairns and their lovely herd of cattle. - Do you think we're men enough to take it off them? (ominous music) (Una gasps) - Ha, ha, ha. So you've been looking after me cattle. Very good of ya. - They're not yours. - They are now! (dramatic music) (brigand laughing) - I know you. You're Duncan MacRae. You touch one head of those cattle and you'll feel the thrust of Rob Roy's claymore. (Duncan chuckles) - Och, look. You dropped your chanter. Pick it up lad. (chanter snaps) (Una gasps) Och, did I accidentally break it? - Rob Roy gave that to me and he'll make you pay for it. - Rob Roy's far away in the north country. And anyway you'll not be telling him who took the cattle will you now? - Of course we'll tell him. You'll not have a moment's peace Duncan MacRae. (ominous music) - Oh, I knew I could trust you to keep your mouth shut, 'cause I'm gonna shut it for you. (brigand roars) (brigand gulps) - Run Una! Run! Fetch the MacGregors as fast as you can. - Oh Colin! Take care! - Ah! (dramatic music) (gunshot bangs) (Duncan yells) (triumphant music) - Rob Roy! - MacGregor! - MacGregor! - Come on Rob Roy! I warned you! (rousing music) (swords clanging) (men grunting) (brigand muttering) - Och! You're a brave man Duncan MacRae. Attacking unarmed children takes real courage. - (chuckles) I knew you were hiding there Roy MacGregor. Just wanted to draw you out so I could finish you off. Now! - Look out Rob! (metal clanging) - MacGregor! MacGregor! - Rob Roy MacGregor. - MacGregor! MacGregor! - It's lovely weather for this time of year don't you think Hamish? - Aye Rob! (shield bangs) - What do you think MacRae? Doesn't this bonny weather feel good, just to be alive? - All right you two, on your feet and over the rest. And quick about it. (men grumble) (ominous music) - Ouch! Ooh! Ooh! (gentle music) (cow moos) - Now you sniveling MacRaes, off with your footwear. (men grumbling) Och, away. What's that dreadful stench? Throw them in that river Colin. - You'll kill the poor wee fishes. (children laugh) - Don't you MacRae's ever wash. (cow sniffs) (cow moos) All right you villains. Face the rock with your hands behind your backs. Tie their hands children. - What with Rob? - Use their belts. (men grumbling) If I ever catch any of you near here again, you'll sing "Auld Lang Syne" for the last time. Do you understand? (children laugh) - Ow! - Ooh! - Ah! - Ow! - It's a pity you've no respect for the pipes. Fancy crushing the lad's chanter with your great clumsy hooves. (bagpipe hooting) Perhaps this'll teach you some manners. (children laughing) (bagpipe hoots discordantly) (cows mooing angrily) - Whoa! (bagpipe blowing discordantly) - Enjoy your bath MacRae. You need a good scrub. - Watch out for the waterfall! (everyone laughing) (cart rumbling) (anticipatory music) - You two! Stand guard! - But sir, I've been on duty since last night. - Don't argue with me Soldier. Stuart, isn't it? James Stuart? - Yes sir. No, sir. That is, I'm Stuart, but I wasn't arguing just- - I've no time to waste with you. His grace the Duke of Montrose awaits me. You're fined a month's pay. Now stand guard! (foreboding music) (knocking on door) - Ah yes. - Graham of Killearn here, your grace. - Enter. You have the gold of the clans? - Aye your grace. All locked safely in the bullion wagon under guard in the inner stables. I have the only keys. - Give me them! (keys clattering) Good. When the time comes, we'll send the king, his (sniggers) share. - What are you going to do about the Duke of Argyll? - I don't know. His family, the Campbells and mine the Grahams, have been enemies for generations. - When King George makes him chief minister for Scotland, he'll be collecting the taxes. - Aye, which means he'll soon find out how much we've been keeping to cover expenses. - Can't you turn the king against him. - What do you think I've been working at man? - What if we could prove that Argyll was plotting against his majesty. - (scoffs) Impossible. - Not if we had Rob Roy testify against him. - Don't be stupid. The red MacGregor would never betray his friend the Campbell. His own mother was one. - That's why the king would believe him. Every man has his price. - Ha ha, Not Rob Roy. - Perhaps he'll do it for nothing. Just a wee loan that will be repaid with interest. - You have a plan in that sneaky head of yours, eh Killearn? - Aye, your grace, I do at that, and it involves a man, Bruce MacDonald. - MacDonald, never! He's Rob Roy's friend and chief drover. - Yes, and his young brothers down in your dungeon right this very minute. Poaching deer was his crime, I recall. (foreboding music) - Well Rob Roy MacGregor, here's my hand on it. - [Rob] And here's mine your grace. - So now his grace, the Duke, will invest 1000 pounds in your skill in buying and selling cattle. As soon as we've completed the paperwork. - What paperwork? I've given my hand on it. - I ken that Robbie, but well we've just got to keep up with the times. Sign the silly wee bit of paper and be done with it. (foreboding music) - My home? My house and land at Inversnaid? - It's only a security MacGregor. His grace doesn't want your poor house. Why, he already has this fine castle and a grand house in Glasgow. - And don't forget Robbie, half the profit's yours. (dramatic music) - Och well that's different! (light music) - Good morning Rob! - Good morning Rob. (knocking on door) - And how's Bruce MacDonald this bonny morning? - Good day to you Rob, I've been expecting you. Do come in. Congratulations. So you've gone into partnership with his grace, the Duke of Montrose. - We have Bruce, and since it's his money, I suppose we can trust him. Now I want you to take the money and head up to Inverness. You ken old Angus MacVey. - Aye, that I do. - He's got a great herd of fine beef and a desperate shortage of money. We'll take the lot. - Now, Rob, this is all the Duke's money, not a penny of your own? - That's the only way I'd ever go into business with that scheming miser. But half the profit will be ours. Why? What's worrying you? - Oh nothing. - I'll follow in a couple of days with the rest of the men to drive the cattle down to the lowlands. This is just the chance we've been waiting for isn't it? - Aye, it's an opportunity not to be missed, right enough. - What's the matter man? Cheer up. We're going to get rich. (pensive music) (horse whinnying) (foreboding music) - It's all there. Not a penny more, not a penny less. Now where's my brother? - Take this and go to Glasgow for a few days. Enjoy yourself like a rich man. Make sure folks know who are. Then disappear. Get out of Scotland before Rob Roy finds ya and don't come back, or I'll be after you too. - Where's my brother? - Send me a letter from London and I'll set him free. You have my word on it. (indistinct chatter) - Right. Let's be on our way. To drive the cattle down to the lowlands. (bagpipe music) (gunshot bangs) (ominous music) - [Man] Whoa there MacGregors. Lay down your arms or suffer the consequences. - If there's a man among you, come down and meet a better one. - Careful Rob. Take cover. - On your feet men. (laughs) Alpine, play us a tune. (bagpipe music) Goodness me, men, look! It's his grace the Duke of Argyll. If I'd known, I'd have been more respectful. - I have to admit Rob, there's no fooling you. (men laughing) - Doing a little poaching your grace? This is Montrose country. - Poaching MacGregor? Nonsense. This is one of my beasts. Just chased it over the boundary. - Och, doesn't that happen to us all the time Hamish. (men laugh) - Things are going well for you, Rob? - They're getting better. No doubt about it. It's kind of you to ask. - I thought they must be after seeing your man MacDonald enjoying the fruits of his labor in Glasgow. Indeed, things must be a lot better. (foreboding music) - We've got him your grace. - Do you not know how to knock man? - Sorry. Thought you'd want to know. Rob Roy has returned from Glasgow and come to report the loss of your money. - Ah! So my plan is working. Show him in and leave us, I'll talk to him man to man. - Never! That's treachery. A MacGregor never betrays his friends. - Hello Jamie. You're looking tired. Did you get your pay dear? Oh! (woman crying) - What's the matter Mrs. Stuart? - Graham of Killearn told me if we don't pay rent today, we'll be evicted and lose our lease. - Well, now Jamie's in the Duke's service. Have you no money? - Killearn fined me my first month's pay. - Oh, he's an evil man. But what can we do? - Here, this will pay your rent. - But I don't know when I can repay you. - Don't worry, Killearn will do that for you. He'll be very pleased I'm sure. (laughs) - It appears to be all here. - Of course it is. Now I'll have my receipt if you please. (light music) (dramatic music) - Out of my way MacGregor. - I believe you're in my debt. (tense music) - Guards! Do your duty! - The first to move is a dead man. - My fee for the time and trouble you've cost me. You need a lesson in Christianity for you're a hard and bitter man. The holy waters of this pool, blessed by the good St. Villan are said to possess amazing powers for curing madness. You ken now don't you. So you ken we're just helping the poor man. You'd have to be mad to be so heartless would you not? Would he not indeed? (Killearn yelling) (Killearn gasping) I think he's looking better. - Och, I don't know Rob. - Well, let's ask his men. Do you think he should go down again, for his own good? I never thought Killearn's men would care so much for his health. So to be sure of a cure, we'll dip him again. (men laughing) - Don't you... (laughs) - Your grace, the time has come to execute your deed over the MacGregor's property. Rob Roy must be taught a lesson. - That might be difficult with 300 or more of his clan around him. - I'll find a way. (ominous music) Helen Mary MacGregor? - You know I am, what do you want? My husband's not here. - What a pity. I have a warrant for his arrest and a deed to confiscate all his property. - Why? - To compensate his grace for the money your thieving husband stole. - You're a liar. He's never stolen a thing in his life and you know it. You'd never dare to speak like that in his presence. You're only brave before women and wee bairns. - Search every house. Take everything of value, then burn the village! - No! No! Oh! (dramatic tense music) (baby crying) (woman screaming) (soldiers yelling) (woman screaming) (women screaming) - Women and bairns eh? (people muttering) - We all ken why we're here. (people agreeing) Our homes are destroyed and I've been declared an outlaw because of the treachery of his grace, the Duke of Montrose. (people mutter angrily) - Let's march on Murdoch Castle and burn it to the ground. - Aye, that's just what I feel like doing. But then King George would send an army of redcoats and turn the Highlands into a blood bath. But Montrose'll pay for his crimes. We'll live off his lands better than we've ever lived before. He'll know the wrath of the MacGregors. (people cheering) We've many friends who've sheltered our women and children. And we'll all feast on the Duke's cattle. Aye, 'tis going to be a grand winter for the clan Gregor. (people cheering) (bagpipe music) (light music) - Hamish, wait, I have a message from Jamie. Tell Rob, the gold of the clans is going to Glasgow tomorrow night. - Which road are they using? - The back road, through Balder Rock. - Aye, I ken it well. - And Jamie said to tell you, he'll have a strong mounted guard. So take care, young Hamish. (suspenseful music) (wolf howling) (owl hooting) (dramatic music) (horse whinnying) - Aargh! - Aargh! Run! (eerie music) (horse whinnies) - The hobgoblins are after us. Run for your lives. (ghostly howls) It's the banshees. We're done for! (soldiers yelling) The flibberty-gibbets are going to eat us. Escape while you can! Run for your... - You can stop now Jamie. They've all run away! (men laughing) - They've put the rents up again. - Not again! How do they expect us to live? - Name. - Mary of Drymen, same as it always was. As you'd know if you had the manners to look. I hear you put the rents up again. - If you can't pay, get out and good riddance. - But- - No buts. Next. (men cheering) (bagpipe music) What's that? - Och don't you know it? And you're a Graham. (chuckles) It's a sweet little Highland air called "Up with the Campbells and down with the Grahams." - Of course I know it, you old hag. Arrest whoever's playing that dreadful music. - I think they play it very well. - Silence! (dramatic music) - Rob Roy! - You're right for once Graham of Killearn. Good afternoon Mary. - You're a bonny sight Rob Roy. Are you doing well dear? - Och, times are hard, but I expect things will pick up this very afternoon. - Arrest that outlaw! (dramatic music) (metal clanging) - I understand you put the rents up. Did you learn nothing from the good St. Villan? - Don't you lay a hand on me Rob Roy. The escort will be here any minute to take the money safe to his grace. Ye'd better flee while you can. - I believe the escorts are a wee bit busy down the road away, so we'll have to keep that money safe for his grace in case the hob goblins come after you. I reckon I can slice your gizzard before you pull the trigger. What do you think? Aye, that's better. Now I'll tell you what we're going to do. Every tenant is going to get a full receipt and a 50% refund. - But the duke will be furious. - Why it's not his money. This is part of what they call reparation, for the burning of Inversnaid and all the property you stole. Write Mary of Drymen's receipt first. - Where are you taking me? - Since you've no money, I'll have you. And we'll see how much Montrose'll pay to save your hide. - Oh, no. I beg you leave me be. Montrose will never pay a ransom. I know it. - Then you'll have a fine view of Loch Katrin as you swing from a branch of its tallest tree. It's lovely at this time of year. (suspenseful music) - Put your hands up. (light music) - That's right Una. Pull it in! - [Rob] Good girl. - He's brought a letter from Montrose. - And then he says, "Enough's enough. Let's make peace. I admit I misjudged you. And as a result, maybe did you wrong?" Well, maybe. Anyway, "It's costing me too much money to fight you. So I'll meet you alone and pay what you demand. If you just bring back my faithful servant unharmed and then let's pledge to fight no more Rob Roy. And I'll give you my hand on it." Signed James Graham, Duke of Montrose. Well, what do you say to that? - You canna trust a Graham. - It's a chance for peace. - It might be a trap. - The thing that convinces me that he means what he says is the complaint of the pain in his pocket, it has a strong ring of the truth. - Oh Rob. (thunder rumbling) (suspenseful music) (horse whinnies) - No tricks Montrose. I may be alone, but I'm not unarmed. - I'm not even armed MacGregor. Here's your money. Now let's make an end to all our troubles. Shall we shake hands? Or will you send Graham of Killearn to collect his own ransom for being so careless? (chuckles) Here Killearn. (horse whinnies) You're an even bigger fool than I thought MacGregor. You didn't even bring reinforcements. - I gave my word and accepted yours. Do you mean to break it? (Montrose laughs) - But I'd already given my word to have your hide, Rob Roy. When I've fulfilled that pledge, you and I will be at peace. Take him alive if you can sergeant. - I'll take at least 10 of you with me. - Then shoot him like a dog. - The first to move is a dead man. Drop your weapons! (gunshot bangs) - Hamish! - So it seems you don't keep your word MacGregor. - He trusted you Montrose, but we didn't. So now we'll take you and see how much ransom Graham of Killearn can pay to get you back, if he wants ye. - I think not, show yourself Duncan MacRae. (ominous music) (men gasp) - Surrender. - Kill them, Rob. - Save us Rob! (dramatic music) - Wait men! Release the children unharmed, and you have my word. You'll go free and safe. - I never take the word of a MacGregor. And I doubt you'll risk the wee bairns, you're too soft. - You're a dead man MacRae. - Hold it Hamish. Montrose! - Aye MacGregor. - If I surrender, the children go free. There'll be no bloodshed. Do you agree? - Aye I do. - You canna trust him Rob. - We have no alternative. - [Colin] So once again Rob Roy saved Una and me from the clutches of Duncan MacRae. As they approach the Fords of Crew, Rob knew he was in desperate trouble with the hangman's noose awaiting him at Stirling Castle, but with all those guards and his hands so tightly bound, their seemed no hope of escape. - Psst! Rob! - Jamie, you shouldn't be out on such a night. You could catch your death. - I've been near all the time. I even had my musket on Montrose and if you or the children had been harmed, he was a dead man. - Aye, you're a good lad Jamie Stuart. - Get ready as we go down the bank to the ford, I'll cut your bonds. With all this rain the river should be swollen enough so you can accidentally fall off your horse and swim away. (thunder rumbling) - Watch the prisoner. - I think I saw the MacGregors, among the trees. (lighting crashes) I'll reconnoiter. - That young man has courage. What's his name? - Er. Er. Not Stuart, surely? - Well, is it? Don't you know your own troops man? - Aye, it's Stuart your grace. - All clear your grace. Not a MacGregor in sight. - (laughs) Well done Stuart. That young man deserves a promotion Killearn. You hear that MacGregor, you're on your own. (dramatic music) MacGregor! Where's the MacGregor, he's escaped! - Look there he is, there's Rob Roy. (gunshots banging) I think he's hit. Dead and drowned and shot. - Well that's the end of Rob Roy. Now we can all go home and sleep in peace. (eerie laughing) (light music) - So, that's what the scoundrel's been up to. I'm indebted to you Rob, for your courage and loyalty. Montrose has a great deal of power, but you beat him at every turn. To the MacGregors. As you know, I'm a general in the British army and the government owes me a favor or two. Next week I have an audience with his majesty and I'll be seeking a pardon for you Rob. In the meantime, you and your people can shelter from Montrose on my land. - [Colin] So great was the rage of James Graham, Duke of Montrose, at Rob Roy's escape, that even as Argyll was promising to help the MacGregor, he'd already journeyed south for an audience with King George at Hampton Court to plead for assistance in capturing the audacious outlaw. - Wouldn't it be simpler to repair Hadrian's wall. Let the barbarians keep Scotland. Who wants it anyway? - But sire, you have thousands of loyal tax-paying subjects in Scotland. - Tax! Tax! The tax monies you promise never arrive. - Stolen by Rob Roy your majesty. - Is that so? Well that's different. How many men do you want? (ominous music) (light music) (horse hoofs clopping) - Who is it? - Quick, we better hide. It's Graham of Killearn. (suspenseful music) - Morning MacRae. - Is it safe to talk here. This is MacGregor country you know. - I ken that, that's why we're here. They'd never expect you and me to meet beside Loch Lomond, would they now? - Hmm. Since it's a private conversation we're having. Let's use this wee cave. Well Killearn, you wanted to see me, here I am. - You are indeed. Well now, his grace wants you to help ambush Rob Roy. - Aah, you need an army of redcoats to catch that one. - Well, we won't have that, but we will have our own men and the element of surprise. But the problem is the Duke of Argyll has extended his protection to the clan Gregor. So all the cowards, including Rob Roy are hiding on his lands. - (growls) What do you want me to do? Chase them numbskulls into your trap. - There's a small Glen just below Ben Raggie, where we will be waiting. Now, if you lay your hands on those McAllister children, Rob Roy'd follow you fair across Scotland to rescue them. (Una gasps) Did you hear something? - Eh, just rats. So, when do you want to finish the MacGregors. The sooner, the better I'd say. (suspenseful music) Do you think they heard us. - Every word. Those frightened little children are going to lead Rob Roy straight into our trap. - Rob! Rob! Duncan MacRae's after me. - Now don't worry. You two are going to stay at Argyll castle till this all over. He's in England seeing the king, but there's no reason we shouldn't give Montrose's face one last slap and put an end to Duncan MacRae for good. Thanks to you, brave children we have plenty of time. (anticipatory music) - Your majesty, I come to beg a pardon for one of your innocent subjects who has been unjustly accused. - Ja, who? - Rob Roy MacGregor, your majesty. - I beg your pardon? - Nay sire, I beg yours. - What was that name? - Rob Roy MacGregor, your majesty. - Uh, ooh, ah. Well I have given his grace the Duke of Mongoose ein company of fusiliers to hunt and wipen out this brigand Rob Roy. (ominous music) - You have his majesty's orders Captain Clifford. If Rob Roy is not killed in the fight, he is to be executed immediately upon capture. There's to be no chance of escape. - I don't like it your grace. It's not the honorable thing to do. - You don't have to like it, Clifford. Just do your duty. Come, Jamie. Let's inspect the men. It's rare to find a man with your courage, Jamie. That's why I made you captain of the guard. But I've even better places in mind for you. Graham Killearn's getting too old for the job. Fancy letting himself be captured by Rob Roy. But as soon as the MacGregor is dead and buried, we'll talk about your future. (ominous music) - Positions everyone. They're coming. - Whsst, lad. Careful, you wouldn't want to warn them would you? - Right, let prepare a welcome for his graceless grace, the Duke of Montrose and the dirty Duncan MacRae. - Enough MacGregor. You're under arrest. Lay down your arms or your dead. (dramatic music) - Oh no! - Surrender MacGregor, or your men will be shot down. - [Colin] Rob Roy was never beaten. He just knew when to stop fighting. He would never spill blood for no good purpose and would do anything to save those he loved, including sacrificing himself. - Alright, captain, do your duty. Execute the prisoner, Rob Roy MacGregor. (men gasp) - I'm sorry sir. I can't follow that order. It's not the custom for British regiments to execute prisoners who have surrendered as ordered. - It's the king's command. - With all due respect. I only have your word for that, Sir. - Isn't my word good enough for you? - It's nay good enough for anybody, you lying, thieving murderer. - A hundred guineas for the man who kills him. - I'll do it. (ominous music) (gunshot bangs) - You! - Aye, you're lucky it wasn't you. - Order them to lay down their arms or it will be you. Now! - Will you release me, er, us, if I do. - Aye, I give my word. - You hear that Captain Clifford. Order your troops to lay down their arms and Rob Roy will let us all go free. - I'm sorry, sir. I have my orders. - Damn your orders, do as I say. - I can have one of my marksman pick you off MacGregor. - Then the Duke and I will die together. - Do you play chess MacGregor? - Aye. - What's a duke worth? - This one's worth sweet Fanny McAdams if we don't walk out free. - I quite understand. Since the Duke's your prisoner. That leaves me as commanding officer. I refuse to order my men to lay down their arms, but, if you release the Duke, we'll march out of here and leave you and your men free. - If I release him, you'll no longer be commanding officer. - Let me go MacGregor and I give you my word. - Shut up! - Your grace, if I am to get you out of here alive, I must have your irrevocable promise that I'll remain in command of this company until we make contact with other British forces. Do you agree? - Aye. Oh, I do. I do. - Mr. MacGregor. I never break my word. If you release his grace, we'll leave and I promise there'll be no treachery. Will you trust me? - Aye, I trust you Clifford. (duke whispers) (military tattoo) - Company attention. Company as you were. - Other British forces, Captain Clifford. You're no longer in command. Now I'll execute the renegade. - One twitch and you're history. - I'll have you court martialed. - Captain Clifford? - Sir. - Your new orders from his majesty. You'll place your company at my disposal, understood? - Yes sir. - Well it seems I got here in the nick of time, only one casualty and I doubt he'll be much mourned. - I want this man arrested and charged with murder, mutiny, threatening his commanding officer and then hanged. - What if he's found not guilty? Perhaps you better wait till you hear my news. (pompous music) I have some good news and some bad news. By order of his majesty King George, et cetera, et cetera. All members of the clan Gregor are hereby pardoned for any crimes done or deemed to be done to this date. In particular, the chief of the clan, Rob Roy MacGregor. (people cheering) (triumphant music) - Well what's the good news? (men laughing) - The other news Sir, is that his majesty orders you to report to him immediately at Hampton Court. Some might think that's good news, but I doubt you will. Captain Clifford, escort the Duke of Montrose to Hampton court to await his Majesty's pleasure. The rest of you are free men. (men cheering) - [Colin] Och, there was feasting and rejoicing in the MacGregor clan that night and from that day forward, the Duke of Montrose gave them no more trouble. Rob Roy was chief of the clan for many years to come and lead them into lots of adventures, which is only what you'd expect from such a hero. (upbeat music)
