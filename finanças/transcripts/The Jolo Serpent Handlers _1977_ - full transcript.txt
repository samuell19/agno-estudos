I'd heard about them being serpent handlers. But I always desired to go, I said I've just got to go over there and see what they're doing! See if they really are handling serpents. So I got the chance to go one night. And I was sitting in the back of the church, and I didn't believe they handled serpents. And the lady that was beside of me punched me, she said, "Look there, Bryson, that man's got one around his neck." And I looked over and I thought I was gonna hit the floor. But I headed up, I was shouting, and I shouted all the way up front and sat right down on the box. - Isn't that a pretty good hide you got there. (laughing) (chattering) - [Preacher] Lord Jesus, we praise you. We praise you, Lord, for your valued Spirit, Lord, and you give me the great news. - [Crowd] In Jesus' name. (crowd mumbling) (babies crying) - I'm well to be willing to stand up for praying anytime, but any word any place, if we're called upon to witness the Lord. Well we'll be able to call on you. And tell the people whose side you're on. Because he said "You are my witness". (guitar music) I'm willing to sing this song. Now we need to get in here to service to the Lord. There's more to it than just singing and shouting. Handling serpents, there's a deepness of God's that goes with the singing. - [Man] All right! (guitar playing) (mumbling) - I know we get it hard, we're down, but that ain't no excuse. (guitar music) (crowd cheering) (crowd yelling) - Yeah! (clapping) - I wouldn't think about something that wasn't in the word. Trying to practice it, or tell people to practice it. But I feel like what's in there we got to... We got to believe. And I feel like that what it tells us that we got to do it. If the place suffers, it just has to suffer. And the seminal asked you, now particularly about the serpents. But some people take the serpents and they'll call that the signs, well there's four more signs. Not just the serpents. Honey it takes it all. It really takes it all. Now the five signs, the signs is not the gospel. It's the signs of the gospel... But I feel like that when they preach the gospel, that they should believe the five signs and they should practice them. But if somebody gets bit with the serpent, of trying to be obedient to the word, and they give their life to the word's sake. Well it's no more than John the Baptist. You know they beheaded him. Well now the law in this area, is they stand for us. They know our lives... But now some you... Now you take just this closest Cundiff Virginia, or anywhere in Virginia, they're so cruel. They don't like to give a serpent handler a freedom for nothing. And they just soon look at you and talk mean to you. It's not, it don't matter. And I guess if it wasn't for the law, they would even knock you in the head. - [Woman] Do you always do this-- - [Man] Yes, before taking them to the service people we wash them. We want clean serpents. (laughs) They're nasty enough the way it is. So we try to be clean with them as we possibly can. - [Woman] Danny, does stuff ever happen that the serpents get used to you? And after a while they-- - No. - They don't mind people-- - No. - Holding them? - You can't... You can't tame a serpent. (laughs) You might can keep one maybe if they could live a year, and it would still bite you. - Yeah? - Yeah. You'll not tame them. - [Woman] What do you feed them? - Feed them? Most time when you catch them and they in captivity like that they won't eat. - [Woman] They won't? - They eat dirt. Yeah. - They do? - Yeah. - I didn't know that. - Now sometimes, we have force fed them before. - [Woman] What do you feed them? - What didn't we feed them? You can get mice and feed them, or raw meat. They'll eat raw meat. Most time when you get them in captivity like that, they won't eat though. - [Woman] Now can you use any kind of serpents in the service? - Any kind? - Yeah. - We'll use any kind with poison. So, non poison we don't use in our service. - [Woman] Does it say in the Bible that they have to be poison? - It says that they shall take up serpents, so that's a serpent. I guess you could use them but we don't. What would be the benefit? - [Woman] But why do you think the people around here don't understand your (cars drown out speaker) - They got different versions of the Bible I guess. But the Bible should read to us all just alike. (mumbles) - Well, I'm gonna take you. There's only one occasion I can remember in school, where I had a rough time. It was when I was in the ninth grade. There was a boy that you know, were calling us snake handlers. And saying we were trying to kill ourself, but my science teacher put us in to that. He said it was everyone's freedom and religion, how they wanted to believe. The Bible says it and we're trying to live by the Bible so, he says they shall take up serpents, it means they shall take up serpents. So I feel that to me, if I didn't take them up I don't think I wold make heaven my home. - This is my place of worship because everywhere I went, people didn't like you to shout. They didn't like you to worship God like you really wanted to. And the first night I was at Jolo, I reckon I danced my shoe heel off. 'Cause I looked around, I didn't have no shoe heel I danced it plum off of my foot. And I just began to fit in with the people. And they way they believed, and it's just right down like I believed it. I never believed in handling serpents, but I know that it was in the Bible. But I never went it to it until I came to jolo. - Well I started a little church it burnt down. Then I just here to wonder... They'd get to preaching and they'd leave something out. And then the next thing you know, I was moved to another church. They'd leave something out, I'd move to another church. So now that I've come to Bob's and Barb's that's where I find most of the word. More than anywhere I've ever went. - Two years ago my father was bit at Scrabble Creek. He got bit about five times on one hand. And he suffered for five days. We thought he was getting better but then he died. And we had a serpent handler funeral for him. And like we have church... And in less than three months my husband got bit, my first husband. And by a yellow rattler he lived about 20 hours and he died. They both suffered a lot, but there's no way to turn back although they've died... It's still right, it's still in the Bible. It don't change it... any of the word. It's really hard these days to find people that really get together and feel each others love, and spirit you know, and want to really be concerned for each other. We really have a lot of that at Jolo. Jolo's a very simple place. There's no theater or anything for the kids to go to. It's just closed in around here. When I was growing up, all the youthful things that people enjoy I had to give up for the Lord. Going to the movies, and there were always dances and proms. And rock and roll music. There were engagement rings that I never got to take part in. And jewelry of any kind. During the week I spend a lot of hours alone. I go to the store and to the post office and that's just about it unless I visit you know... I very seldom visit anyone except mom. My husband works for Number 10 Coal Company hauling fuel. I start cooking supper, I'd say around 3:30. 'Cause he gets home around 4:30 unless he works a double. Two or three times a week he works double time. Sometimes we go to church during the week though, during the night on Wednesdays and Fridays. So that kind of splits up the week a little for me. A lot of time Dewey comes down, my uncle. And we sit and talk Danny will come up Danny Hobart, my cousin. We talk about the Bible, and where we're going to church, and all the places and people we're gonna see. Since Dewey has been on disability from the mines, you know he takes care of our serpents and gathers them for us. He sees to it that we have serpents to handle. Takes care of the treasure of the church, the cleaning of the church. He's sees to it ti gets done. Our church, and our friends, it's more like a big happy family. It's not like friends or church at all. It's just like everyone belongs to each other. (guitar music) âª And I won't be coming back anymore âª âª No I won't be coming back anymore âª âª I won't be coming back anymore âª âª Well I'm on my way to heaven over on the other shore âª âª And I won't be coming back anymore âª âª I'm gonna meet my praying mother âª âª And I'll take her by the hand âª âª And I'll know her as I've known her here before âª âª I'll have many years to talk with her âª âª Over on that other land âª âª And I won't be coming back anymore âª âª Well I won't be coming back anymore âª âª No I won't be coming back anymore âª âª Well I'm on my way to heaven over on the other shore âª âª And I won't be coming back anymore âª âª I'm gonna meet my praying mother âª âª And I'll take her by the hand âª âª And I'll know her as I've known her here before âª âª And I won't be coming back anymore âª âª Well I won't be coming back anymore âª âª Well I won't be coming back anymore âª - [Man] A lot of people think "Well I can handle a serpent", or I can do this, or I can do that. Just 'cause they can. But it takes a good life. 'Cause we've got our life in it. When we take up a serpent, we're holding our life in our hand. 'cause I can look at that thing and say "Well, that could bite me and I could die". And if I've got anything in my life, it could take it. - [Crowd] We need you Jesus, right now. God we need your power, Lord. (yelling) (mumbling) - [Woman] Jesus, Jesus we beg you tonight Lord. (mumbling) God touch him please! God we beg you right now, God. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. (mumbling) - The reason we all gathered here was because Dewy got bit. Of course I didn't know it until I got here. When I got here we all received the call that he was bit. So they've been calling people in, like we do when somebody is bit. The whole church usually comes and.. We get together, we sing, and we pray. Mostly we pray. And we've had to pray I think about... Must've been about five times tonight we've prayed. And we're probably throughout this morning, this morning right now, probably throughout the morning we'll be on and off praying and singing. (mumbling) - [Man] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus... (mumbling) (clock ringing) (group praying indistinctly) (upbeat gospel music) (clapping) (singing indistinctly) (guitar music) (mumbling) (group praying indistinctly) (mumbling) (guitar music) âª Oh, how I love Jesus âª âª Oh, how I love Jesus âª âª Oh, how I love Jesus âª âª Because He first loved me âª âª How can I forget him âª âª How can I forget him âª (mumbling) - [Man] Hit that knuckle, past two hours (mumbles) - That's where he bit me. (mumbling) I think I git bit. I know I got bit. - Why'd you get bit? - Well, (laughs) It's God's will when we get bit, the way I look at it... It's up to God whether they hurt us or don't hurt us, or kill us or what have ya. He's our maker. The lord giveth and the Lord taketh. And he gives your life and takes it. He gives your health and he can take it. I say that the Devil's got something to do he permits the Devil to. The way I look at it. 'Cause all good things comes from God. But he permits the Devil to do things. - [Woman] We're you afraid last night? - No. No. No I didn't care what'd happen. I didn't want to hurt but I didn't care if I die or nothing like that. No... Cause I said a long time ago, when my time comes to die, that's the way I want to die anyhow. When my time comes that's the way I want to go. But I don't want to you know I'm in no hurry for it - [Woman] Is this the worst bite you've had? - No. - Looks pretty bad. - Yes he's hurt me. It really hurts. It's still hurting. I'm numb yet all over and tingling all over here. You don't quit tingling My mouth's dry... I couldn't talk too good last night. Couldn't even get my mouth open talk too good... - [Woman] Dewey how many times have you been bitten now? - This will be 68 times. - 68 times? - That's over about 20 years. It ain't too bad. - [Woman] Not too bad (laughs). - Of course some people handles 'em for 30 years, never get bit at all. I don't know why. - [Woman] Why do some people get bitten and not others? - I don't know about that either. Just, like I said it's up to God whether they bite you or not. - [Woman] So when you get bit then, is it the Devil's work or God's will? - Well it's God's will but the Devil's work. Danny's gonna have to start taking some of those bites for ya That's right. Somebody needs to take some of them. - Well see my daughter died... From a serpent bite. But now though we offered her a doctor. And she refused. I believe we offered her a doctor about three times and in my heart, well I wouldn't have. In my heart I really wanted her to ask for a doctor. Where I wouldn't have accepted no... aid like that at all. I wanted her to. Really deep down in me, I didn't want to give her up. She was mine an I loved her very much. And just anything to have kept her here. Even though you know God is God. And he's real, you know what he can do for you. And all power is in his hands and he gives life and he takes it. Still, you want to try everything that you can to keep one with you as long as you can too. - [Woman] Do you mourn for somebody whose has been serpent bit and died? - Yes honey I...the loss of them is all. Now today it's just as fresh in my memory of losing my daughter that's something you never get used to. You just have to learn to live with it. But now my daughter and my brothers and sisters and my church, that die like that, it hurts me. It hurts me a lot. And you know that he has to be my own child. And I take spells you know I... think I can see her coming and I'll imagine you know I can see her. And I decide to talk to her. And a lot of times there just me myself, I shed a lot of tears about her. But you know I know that... I know too she's safe, I feel that she's safe. It's not that I'm worried about her soul, or anything, I feel like that she's really... really saved. I feel like she died right in the Lord. But still that don't keep me from missing her. And having her around. - I think it's God's will I got bit, or I wouldn't have been bit. - [Woman] Do you think God wanted you to suffer? - He could. - Yeah or he could stop suffering. - [Woman] He can convince you to suffer for a purpose? - Yeah but we're not supposed to question it. - [Danny] I've never question to God on every bite I've ever had. - [Woman] Do you try to live better after you're bit? - You better live good before you get bit. (laughing) - To me eternal life is something that's more greater than anything we can have in this life. It's the hope of glory. You know is there'll be no more sorrow, no pain, no trials and temptations nor things to go through with. If we can just live to the place that we can have eternal life. - A lot of people talk to you sometimes, and they'll ask you if you have to handle a serpent to.. to go back with him when he comes. I tell them they have to take the word. The Bible says the believers, the sign to follow the believers. But it still tells you in another place all on belief will have his part. So according to the word, you have to have it. - I say it to 'em like this - I've got to do. I've got to. The other people not is up to them but I've got to. I've done it too long and... I've been bit too many times to just get up and say I quit. (banjo music) âª Oh They'll be singing in that land âª âª They'll be singing in that land âª âª They'll be singing in that land where I'm at âª âª They'll be singing in that land âª âª They'll be singing in that land where I'm at âª âª They'll be singing in that land âª âª They'll be shouting in that land âª âª They'll be shouting in that land âª âª They'll be shouting in that land where I'm at âª âª They'll be shouting in that land âª âª They'll be shouting in that land âª âª They'll be shouting in that land where I'm at âª âª Don't you wanna go to that land âª âª Don't you wanna go to that land âª âª Don't you wanna go to that land where I'm at âª âª Don't you wanna go to that land âª âª Don't you wanna go to that land âª âª Don't you wanna go to that land where I'm at âª âª Oh They'll be preaching in that land âª âª They'll be preaching in that land âª âª They'll be preaching in that land where I'm at âª âª They'll be preaching in that land âª âª They'll be preaching in that land âª âª They'll be preaching in that land where I'm at âª âª Don't you wanna go to that land âª âª Don't you wanna go to that land âª âª Don't you wanna go to that land where I'm at âª âª Don't you wanna go to that land âª âª Don't you wanna go to that land âª âª Don't you wanna go to that land where I'm at âª - I know the signs of the gospel's really right I know it's right Of the gospel now, it's not the gospel I want you to know that the serpents and the poison, and laying hands... on the sick, and talking in tongues, and casting out devils is not the gospel. It's the signs of the gospel. - I want to praise God for the victory that Dewey got over that serpent bite People will call around, they'll persecute you for getting bit, honey it's the suffering way. And if one happens to go out like that, you talk about the persecution we really get it Well I got to tell them so often I guess John the Baptist would've liked to kept his head wouldn't he? (mumbles) would've liked to hung on to hung on to his flesh but he loved God more. They stoned him to death and him under the anointing of God preaching against their sin. But they stoned him to death without telling you what he'd done. He's just sat down and went to slepp in Jesus. - [Man] Lord Jesus. Jesus... If you take up serpents right here's the way you do it. A man and a woman saw the serpent, but this right here is a serpent. (crowd yelling) God's people can have power if they want power. And if they don't want power they're not a going to get no power or nothing from God. We are in this thing or either we're out And when people say if they believe this, and they are not got the signs afollowing them, then the Bible says they are un-believers. Exactly what it says. It said they shall take up serpents. Some said if I accidentally we picked one up that's what it means. Bless God that's not what the Bible said. It said they shall. S-H-A-L-L, which is Apostic terms means that they will do it. It doesn't say nothing about maybe. These old hypocrites that changing the Bible around and says if I accidentally pick up one, if it accidentally bites me, it won't hurt me. By God, the Bible did not say that. - [Crowd] Yeah! - You've got to abide in the word, and let the word abide in you and you can ask what you will and he'll do it for you. If you abide in the word like you ought to, then you can ask anything, I don't care what it is and God said he'd do it. (banjo music) God's word cannot fail! (guitar music) (crowd cheering) (crowd cheering)
