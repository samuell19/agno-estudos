A LOT OF THE BLOOD'S ON THE WALL OVER THERE. [Paul] DIETZ. I CHECKED ALL THE DOORS AND THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY FORCIBLE ENTRY. I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT EXACTLY HOW IT HAPPENED YET, BUT THAT SIDE OF BEEF ON THE FENCE IS THE END RESULT. IT MAY BE THE END. BUT THIS IS WHERE IT STARTED. HAVE FORENSICS DO THE ROOF, THAT BEAM AND THOSE WINDOWS. YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT HE JUMPED ON THAT BEAM FROM THOSE WINDOWS? -NO WAY. -OH. YOU SEE THIS? YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS? YOU CLIMB UP THERE. YOU LOOK ON THOSE 2 BY 6s, YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THIS STUFF. IT'S TERMITE DUST, PAULIE. I HAVE A THOUSAND DOLLARS' DAMAGE IN MY GARAGE AND RAFTERS BECAUSE OF THIS. THE KILLER PROBABLY KICKED SOME OFF WHEN HE WAS ON TOP OF THE BEAM. YOU REALLY HAVE A TASTE FOR THIS, DON'T YOU, SHERLOCK? IT'S CALLED OBSERVATION, DR. WATSON. OBSERVATION. IT'S HIM. I'M SURE. UNMISTAKABLE SIGNATURE: SLASH AND STRANGLE. YES, SIR. I'LL GIVE YOU A PRELIMINARY REPORT AS SOON AS I CAN GET SET UP HERE. OK. [police radio chattering] SAM, I'M STACKED UP.

LIKES TO MOVE FROM EAST TO WEST. AND YOU JUST FIGURED THAT L.A. WAS NEXT. SAM, YOU WANT THIS CASE OR NOT? ABSOLUTELY, CAPTAIN. THEN I CAN PRESUME ALL YOUR PIDDLY-ASSED QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED? OH, YES, SIR. EVERYTHING'S AS CLEAR AS L.A.'S AIR. GOOD. NOW YOU TWO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER. KEEP ME POSTED ON YOUR PROGRESS. RIGHT, THANKS. [weights clanking] YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS LOCAL VS. FEDERAL ROUTINE BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T HAVE THE TIME. NEITHER DO I. YOU'RE FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD, BRONX? BROOKLYN. OH, SOUTH PHILLY. I WAS A STREET COP FOR 7 YEARS. FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU, DETECTIVE. SO YOU COULD TRY TO EARN MY RESPECT, I'LL TRY TO EARN YOURS.

YOU WANNA COME JOIN ME? I'LL DRIVE. [Sam] ONLY IF YOUR NAILS ARE DONE.

[phone dialing] I'D BE CAREFUL WITH THAT IF I WERE YOU. THE, UH, PHONE NUMBERS ARE PROGRAMMED IN AND CAN BE EASILY WIPED. YOU GOT ALL THIS HI-TECH STUFF, YOU STILL USE A CRUMMY PAGER. WILL YOU STOP? LOOK AT YOU, YOU'RE LIKE A LITTLE KID. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GOTTA TOUCH EVERYTHING. SO, UH, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, YOU DON'T MIND IF I TAKE ALL THE INFORMATION REQUESTS, RIGHT? GREAT, YOU HANDLE IT. I THINK YOU AND I ARE GONNA GET ALONG JUST FINE. DO YOU EVER HAVE LUNCH WITH A, UH, FORK AND A KNIFE? OR DO YOU JUST GO SANDWICH? [laughs] WE'RE EVEN. OK, GO AHEAD. ALL RIGHT. [man] HEY, DETECTIVE. TAGLIA'S INSIDE. HEY. WHERE'VE YOU BEEN? GOT SIDETRACKED. GOT ANYTHING? UH, NOT MUCH. TAGLIA. VALSONE, F.B.I. GOOD TO SEE YOU, DETECTIVE. HE'S ONLY GOT LIKE A DOZEN NUMBERS IN HERE. YEAH. SO? PIZZA PLACES, LAUNDRY, INSURANCE COMPANIES. NO WOMEN, NO FRIENDS. OH, MAYBE HE WAS AN ANTISOCIAL. WISE GUY. CALL ALL THE NUMBERS. GET THE ADDRESSES. TALK TO ANYBODY WHO KNEW HIM. CHECK THE BANK BOOK FOR THE USUAL. WHAT'S WITH THE SUIT? DON'T ASK. WHERE'D HE GO? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? CHECKING FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. I CAN GET ONLINE ON DOCTOR-- I KNOW THE ROUTINE. I WOULD LIKE TO BE THE ONE TO INITIATE. DETECTIVE DIETZ. DETECTIVE. JUST GOT A 187 CALL. UNIFORMS ON THE SCENE REQUESTED YOU. LOOKS LIKE YOUR KILLER'S WORKING OVERTIME. HE WORKS FAST.

[police radio chattering] [detective] HEY, DIETZ. MORE GRAFFITI. YEAH. JUST BAG IT, PAULIE. BAG IT ALL. [woman screaming] LOOKS LIKE HE KNOCKED HER THROUGH THIS. MAYBE SHE KNOCKED HIM THROUGH. [groaning] [screams] WHAT TIME DID IT STOP RAINING? AROUND NOON. TALK TO ME, BELINDA. AT THIS RATE, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO OPEN UP A BRANCH OFFICE JUST FOR YOU. WE'LL HAVE A TIME OF DEATH AND PARTICULARS TOMORROW. LATE. TIME OF DEATH AROUND NOON OR A LITTLE AFTER. HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT? THERE'S A BROKEN WOODEN TRELLIS OUTSIDE. IT LOOKS LIKE THE VICTIM WAS ATTACKED AND DRAGGED IN HERE. OF COURSE IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAPPEN AFTER THE RAIN STOPPED, OTHERWISE THE INSIDES OF THE BROKEN ENDS WOULD BE WET, TOO. ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SAM? YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. GOOD OBSERVATION. STAR ENCIRCLED ON... DID YOU WANT TO EXAMINE THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE FROM THE L.A. VICTIMS NOW? [Sam] NO. I WANNA GO HOME, RELAX, GO OVER MY NOTES, AND FIND A DIRECTION ON THIS INVESTIGATION. I HAVE A BIT OF COLLATED DATA ON THE PREVIOUS VICTIMS AND CRIME SCENES. YOU'RE WELCOME TO IT IF THAT'LL HELP. YOU'RE GONNA LET ME LOOK AT YOUR F.B.I. WORKING FILES? WHY NOT? YEAH, LIKE YOU SAID, WHY NOT? ALL RIGHT, DO ME A FAVOR, MY FRIEND. THERE'S SOME EQUIPMENT IN THE FRONT SEAT. WOULD YOU LOCK IT UP IN THE TRUNK FOR ME? -YES, SIR. -ALL RIGHT. [Valsone] HAVE A SEAT, DETECTIVE. ARE YOU SHITTIN' ME? N.C.I.C. REPORTS ON THE VICTIMS FROM THE VARIOUS LOCAL DEPARTMENTS. KILLER'S TRENDS, PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE SYMBOLS ON THE WALLS. I GET THE PICTURE. OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, UH, I CAN GO OVER THE MORE PERTINENT DATA WITH YOU OVER DINNER WHICH, BY THE WAY, IS ON ME. WHY'RE YOU BEING SO COOPERATIVE, VALSONE? WHY, YOU LIKE MY COLOGNE OR SOMETHING? YOU KNOW LOBSTER TAILS IN THIS PLACE ARE, UH, SUPERB. THANKS. BUT MY WIFE'S GOT HER HEART SET ON TAKING ME OUT TO DINNER. YOUR WIFE? RIGHT, RIGHT. SOME OTHER TIME. YEAH. I'LL TAKE THESE HOME WITH ME. GO OVER THEM TONIGHT. WE CAN TALK IN THE MORNING. WHATEVER. YOU DROVE. [man on radio] AND FROM THE METRO DESK, DETECTIVE SAM DIETZ WHO SOLVED LAST YEAR'S SUNSET KILLER CASE, IS HEADING UP AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT APPEARS TO BE A NEW SERIAL KILLER IN THE SOUTHLAND AREA. FEW DETAILS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED, BUT 2 RECENT KILLINGS IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA SEEM TO FIT A PATTERN THAT IS OCCURRING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. OH, I'M SORRY, CAROL. JEEZ. SOMETHING SMELLS GOOD. MUST BE YOUR FAMOUS CASSEROLE, HUH? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, SAM? WELL, YOU CALLED EARLIER. I JUST WANTED TO SEE WHAT YOU WANTED. BESIDES, IT'S DINNERTIME. YOU WANT TO FEED A HUNGRY COP? YOU'RE NOT TO COME BY WITHOUT CALLING FIRST. YOU KNOW THE AGREEMENT. ALL RIGHT, SO I DIDN'T. I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND DECIDED TO DROP BY. WHAT IF I HAD SOMEONE HERE WITH ME? WHAT? I DON'T WANT YOU DROPPING BY UNANNOUNCED. THIS IS MY HOME. I'LL VISIT WHEN I WANT TO VISIT. IT HASN'T BEEN YOUR HOME IN QUITE A WHILE, SAM. SAME SONG, 2ND VERSE. I'M NEVER HERE. MY HOME IS AT THE OFFICE. IT'S BULLSHIT, CAROL. I'M TIRED OF HEARING YOU SING IT. YOU KNOW, SAM? SOMETIMES WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES, WHAT I SEE REALLY SCARES ME. I'M THE SAME GUY I'VE ALWAYS BEEN. AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM. EXCUSE ME. I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU, SAM. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO A COUNSELOR WITH ME, I DON'T WANT YOU BACK. I KNOW WHO I AM AND WHAT I WANT OUT OF LIFE. I DON'T NEED A COUNSELOR. WELL, CORY DOES. SAM, HE STILL HAS NIGHTMARES ALMOST EVERY NIGHT. CORY'LL BE OK. WHAT ABOUT YOUR NIGHTMARES, HUH? I'M OUTTA HERE. [bicycle bell ringing] DAD! HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. COME ON, COME ON. [groans] YOU HIT LIKE A TON OF BRICKS. YOU'RE GOING TO STAY, AREN'T YOU? NO, I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO TONIGHT, OK? I'LL PICK YOU UP AT SCHOOL TOMORROW. -OK. -OK? -OK. -OK? OK. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU, TOO, DAD. SEE YOU TOMORROW. [Sam] VALSONE, DIETZ. YEAH, UH, I CAN'T FIND ANY REPORTS ON THE PREVIOUS VICTIMS' RELATIVES IN YOUR WORKING FILES. NO, I'VE BEEN THROUGH BOTH BOXES. I'M TRYING TO GET A FEEL FOR THE PREVIOUS VICTIMS HERE. I GOT NOTHING. YEAH, YEAH, WHATEVER. [Sam] CALL ME TOMORROW, ALL RIGHT? OK. [Grazinsky] WHAT WAS THAT REGARDING? NOTHING REALLY. HAVE I MADE MYSELF CLEAR, AGENT VALSONE? EMINENTLY, SIR. I THINK WE'VE GIVEN YOU ENOUGH TIME WITH NO RESULTS. THESE ARE PROTECTED PEOPLE THAT HE'S MURDERING. HE MUST BE STOPPED. DETAILS, DETAILS, DETAILS. INVESTIGATIONS DO NOT RUN LIKE TRAINS ON A SCHEDULE, MR. GRAZINSKY. GIVE ME THE LIST, YOU'LL GET RESULTS. COME ON. YOU KNOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. IT'S STILL IN NEGOTIATIONS. BESIDES, WE'VE JUST GOTTEN INTO BED TOGETHER. WELL, YOU CAN'T EXPECT MUCH FROM A ONE-NIGHT STAND, CAN YOU? NEED MORE MANPOWER? MONEY? WHATEVER YOU NEED, WE'LL MAKE AVAILABLE TO YOU. MAYBE I'LL TALK TO THE DETECTIVE. FILL HIM IN MYSELF. THAT WOULD BE A BIG MISTAKE. I SUGGEST YOU, UH, SAVE YOUR EMPTY THREATS... SIR. MY THREATS ARE NOT SO EMPTY. YOU GOT 24 HOURS. NO MORE. I UNDERSTAND. [door banging shut] ANYBODY HERE? HELLO, NIGHT SHIFT. IT FIGURES, VALSONE, YOU'RE GONNA EXPEDITE EVERYTHING, HUH? CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING? UH, YEAH. LET ME ASK YOU. CAN I GET INTO N.C.I.C. FROM THIS TERMINAL? MAY I ASK WHY? AND IS YOUR ALIAS AGENT KYLE VALSONE, DETECTIVE? FORGET THE FED, I'M THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER, SAM DIETZ. MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD OF ME? SUNSET KILLER CASE? YEAH, WELL. LOOK, I NEED A COMPLETE N.C.I.C. WORKUP ON ALL THE VICTIMS LOCALLY, THAT'S ALL. BUT I NEED IT TONIGHT. THIS REQUEST WON'T EVEN GO THROUGH OUR SYSTEM. I HAVE TO SEND IT OVER TO THE FEDERAL BUILDING ON WILSHIRE. THEN I HAVE TO CONTACT THE REAL INVESTIGATING OFFICER-- DETECTIVES DON'T WORK ON SCHEDULES. WE GET A BRAINSTORM, WE'VE GOTTA CHECK IT OUT RIGHT AWAY. NOW, IF YOU DON'T WANNA HELP ME, IGNORE ME. I WON'T TELL ANYBODY YOU LET ME PLAY WITH YOUR COMPUTER. [keyboard clicking] [computer buzzing] [Henry] HEY. HEY, MR. MOTOR SKILLS. TAKE IT EASY, MAN. I'LL DO IT. WHY, THANK YOU, HENRY. [sighing] GIVE ME ABOUT 15 MINUTES. [typing] PLEASE DON'T STAND OVER MY SHOULDER. GO EAT A DOUGHNUT OR SOMETHING. OK, BRO. "BRO"? HEY, EINSTEIN, YOU SAID 15 MINUTES AN HOUR AGO. THERE'S SOMETHIN' WRONG WITH THE REQUESTS. LIKE WHAT? D.O.D., THE DATE OF DEATH, 20 YEARS AGO? HOW COULD THEY BE DEAD? THEY WERE JUST MURDERED. WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON? THERE'S GOTTA BE A GLITCH IN THE SYSTEM. MAYBE THE REQUESTS ARE BEING IMPROPERLY CROSSMATCHED. HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA TAKE? I DON'T KNOW, DIETZ. SO YOU'RE TELLING ME I WON'T GET MY REPORT TONIGHT, RIGHT? NOT LIKELY. [people chattering] CAN I HAVE 25 CENTS? YEAH, OK. THANK YOU. [man] HERE'S 5 CENTS. [thumping] [birds chirping] GOOD MORNING. UH, SORRY. EAT UP, HONEY. -HOW'RE YOU DOIN', PAL? -GOOD. ALMOST READY? YEAH. HEY, EAT UP. CAN I GET A CUP OF COFFEE? I TRIED TO CALL YOU LAST NIGHT, SAM. WHERE WERE YOU? -OH, I TOOK A WALK. -UH-HUH. ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE PRECINCT, I BET, HMM? IN SPITE OF WHAT YOU FEEL, I DO HAVE A DUTY TO PERFORM. DOES YOUR DUTY EXTEND 24 HOURS A DAY, SAM? SOMETIMES IT DOES, CAROL. IT'S NOT A JOB, IT'S AN OBLIGATION. OBLIGATION? YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO US. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. FORGET THE COFFEE. I'LL BE IN THE CAR, CORY. SAM. SAM, I'M SORRY. ME, TOO. I'M CRAZED. THEY STUCK ME WITH THIS F.B.I. AGENT AND HE'S A ROYAL PAIN IN THE ASS. BUT YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANNA HEAR ABOUT THAT, RIGHT? IT'S JUST THAT I MISS TALKING WITH YOU. I KNOW. WHAT'S THIS? SANTA ROSA IS LOOKING FOR A NEW SHERIFF. THEY WANT TO GO OUTSIDE THE COMMUNITY. I WAS GOING TO GIVE IT TO YOU LAST NIGHT. IT'S A COMPROMISE, SAM. YOU CAN STILL BE A COP AND CORY CAN GROW UP IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. PLEASE, FOR ME? [whispering] FOR US. WILL YOU THINK ABOUT IT? I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. HAVE A GOOD DAY, HONEY. -BYE, MOM. -BYE. BUCKLE UP. [car engine starting] [police radio chattering] [knocking at door] [Sam] HEY, RALPH, WHAT YOU GOT? I'VE GOT 2 MURDERS, A SUICIDE, AND A HEADACHE. I FOUND THAT AT THE CRIME SCENE. WHAT, HE BURNED HIS PRINTS OFF? NO, DOESN'T LOOK LIKE SCAR TISSUE IMPRESSIONS. LOOKS LIKE HE COVERED 'EM WITH SOMETHING. YEAH, LIKE WHAT? [Valsone] SUPERGLUE. F.B.I. LAB FOUND SOME TRACES OF CYANOACRYLATE ESTER ON SOME OF THE PREVIOUS PRINTS. WE HAD TO LEARN THAT THE HARD WAY. D.C. POLICE UNFORTUNATELY USE SUPERGLUE FUMING ON THEIR CRIME SCENES. OH, I GET IT. -ONE SUPERGLUE DISSOLVES ANOTHER. -EXACTLY. HE DOESN'T NEED GLOVES 'CAUSE HIS PRINTS ARE UNRECOGNIZABLE ANYWAY. AND IF FORENSICS USES LASER SUPERGLUE-- EVEN THE PARTIAL PRINTS DISSOLVE. OH, HE'S GOOD. HE'S VERY GOOD. WHAT, ARE YOU GUYS FORMING AN ADMIRATION SOCIETY? WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT A COLD-BLOODED KILLER HERE. [sighs] GIVENCHY. FUCKIN' F.B.I. I THOUGHT WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER. THAT'S A GOOD POINT. WHY DIDN'T YOU MENTION THE SUPERGLUE? IT'S IN MY WORKING FILE WHICH YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE READ LAST NIGHT. I DIDN'T GET THROUGH ALL OF IT. RIGHT, YOU WERE BUSY CIRCUMVENTING PROCEDURES. THIS IS A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION, DETECTIVE. IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THE CASE, I SUGGEST THAT IF YOU NEED ANY INFORMATION IN THE FUTURE, THAT YOU RUN IT BY ME FIRST. OTHERWISE YOU'RE OUT. I'M OUT? WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED TO "SAM, IT'S YOUR INVESTIGATION"? THINGS CHANGE, PAISAN. HERE ARE THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE RELATIVES YOU WERE LOOKING FOR. THE OTHER FILES ARE THE N.C.I.C. REQUESTS YOU TRIED TO GET LAST NIGHT. 30 MINUTES, SQUAD ROOM. WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE, UH, DIRECTION OF THIS INVESTIGATION. [people chattering] MORNING, FRANCINE. OH, YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO NICE. I LOVE THAT PERFUME. HE'S AT THE TRACK, DIETZ. EVER HEAR OF AN F.B.I. AGENT GIVING UP HIS WORKING FILES? OR EXPEDITING INFORMATION REQUESTS? I UNDERSTAND THIS GUY VALSONE'S UNDER SOME PRESSURE TO CLOSE THIS CASE. HE'S ASKED FOR YOU TO HEAD THE LOCAL INVESTIGATION. WHAT, HE ASKED FOR ME? YEAH, HE DID, SAM. HE EVEN MENTIONED YOU BY NAME. W-W-WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HIM? VALSONE IS FAIRLY HIGHLY PLACED IN THE FEDERAL COMMUNITY. AND HE'S GOOD, ACCORDING TO HIS ARREST RECORD. NOW WILL YOU STOP SCRATCHIN' WHERE THERE'S NO ITCH? SIR. NOW WHAT? WAS THERE SOMETHIN' WRONG WITH OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM LAST NIGHT? I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT STUFF, BUT, UH, FRANCINE MENTIONED SOMETHIN' ABOUT IT THIS MORNING, YEAH. NOW, LOOK, I'M GONNA FINISH MY RUN. YOU GET OUT THERE AND CATCH US A MURDERER, HUH? [Valsone] THE AGE RANGE OF THE VICTIMS, MEN AND WOMEN, IS 30 TO 35. MOST OF THEM HAD BLUE-COLLAR OCCUPATIONS, ALL HETEROSEXUAL. THEY KEPT TO THEMSELVES, VERY FEW FRIENDS. THERE IS NO DIRECT LINK BETWEEN ANY OF THE VICTIMS. THE KILLER SEEMS TO BE STRIKING COMPLETELY AT RANDOM. THERE ISN'T A SERIAL KILLER YET THAT STRIKES RANDOMLY. THANK YOU, DETECTIVE DIETZ. IF YOU CAN ASCERTAIN THIS LINK HERE, I'D CERTAINLY LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT IT. OH. THERE ARE PACKETS SUMMARIZING ALL THIS AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE KILLER'S METHODS. YOU CAN PICK 'EM UP ON THE WAY OUT. THANKS, GUYS. UH, WHAT ABOUT THE POLICE PSYCHOLOGIST'S REPORT? WE'VE HAD 3 PROFESSIONALS ANALYZE THIS KILLER, AND, UH, I DON'T THINK WE'D GAIN ANY NEW INSIGHT BY TALKING TO ANOTHER ONE. IT DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T THIS TIME. RIGHT, AGENT VALSONE? YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO THE PSYCHOLOGIST. I'D LOVE TO. THAT'S WHY I SUGGESTED IT. YOU DO THAT. MEANWHILE, I'LL BE BACK HERE THIS AFTERNOON. THAT WORKS GOOD. 'CAUSE I'LL PROBABLY BE HERE LATER THIS AFTERNOON. YOU'RE REALLY PUSHIN' IT, DIETZ. WHY IS THAT WE'VE GOTTA HAVE A PISSING CONTEST OVER A PSYCHOLOGIST? I WANT DR. PARK'S SLANT ON THIS, ALL RIGHT? HE HELPED ME A LOT WITH THE SUNSET KILLER CASE. WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN IS, HE PRACTICALLY HAD YOUR WHOLE FAMILY MURDERED. -FUCK YOU. -NO, FUCK YOU. YOU KEEP CHALLENGIN' ME ON THIS AND I PROMISE I'LL HAVE YOUR ASS IN THE FILE ROOM, GOIN' OVER RECORDS FROM WORLD WAR II TO NOW. OK? [door closing] HEY, I GUESS YOU FIXED YOUR COMPUTER, HUH? -DID YOU HEAR ME? -YEAH, I HEARD YOU. SOLVED? WELL, IT SEEMS I'VE BEEN TRANSFERRED AND LOST MY PROMOTION. IS THIS BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT? NOW I KNOW WHY YOU BECAME A DETECTIVE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? AND JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION, I DIDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO PROBLEM TO FIX. NOT WITH MY HARDWARE, THERE WASN'T. WHAT? HEY. DIETZ, IF YOU DON'T GET AWAY FROM ME, 2 THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN: YOUR FUNERAL AND MY TRIAL. ARE YOU TELLIN' ME THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE COMPUTER? THERE WAS A SLIGHT PROBLEM, BUT IT WAS SO MINOR. WOULD IT HAVE CAUSED AN INCORRECT MATCH ON THE VICTIMS' PROFILES? NOT IN MY OPINION. [car engine starting] THANKS. HEY, I'M SORRY ABOUT YOU GETTING JERKED AROUND. [Park] HEY, SAM. SAM, UP HERE. HUH? WHERE ARE YOU? -UP HERE. -HEY. COME ON UP. UH, NO, I THINK I'LL WAIT INSIDE. COME ON, THERE'S A LADDER AROUND BACK. YEAH, OK, RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. THIS ISN'T THE MOST COMFORTABLE PLACE TO TALK, YOU KNOW. THAT'S YOUR FAULT. YOU ALWAYS WANT IT YESTERDAY. YOU KNEW TODAY WAS MY DAY OFF WHEN YOU CALLED. WHY DON'T YOU GET CABLE? AH, TELEVISION SHOULD BE FREE. THE WAY MILTON BERLE INTENDED IT. ALL RIGHT, SO TELL ME SOMETHING GOOD. WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, THESE SYMBOLS HAVE ME GOT ME A LITTLE CONFUSED. THEY'RE BOTH PSEUDOMYSTICAL AND... DOC. THAT'S BEEN COVERED. BLUE SKY ME. I NEED AN ANGLE. ALL RIGHT. HERE, HOLD THESE. I'D SAY THE GUY IS EITHER A MILITARY MAN OR IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. LAW ENFORCEMENT? WHAT, A COP? UH, MAYBE WE'D BETTER GO IN. GOOD IDEA. [grunting] [Park] JUST THINK ABOUT IT, NOW. HE KNOWS SUPERGLUE FUMING AND PRINTS AND PROCEDURE. HE'S METHODICAL TO A FAULT. NO LINKS. NOT 1 MISTAKE IN 23 KILLINGS. AND NO ONE IS EVEN CLOSE TO HIM. WHAT ABOUT THE VICTIMS? ANYTHING LINKING THEM TOGETHER? WELL, THEY'RE ALL DEAD. [chuckles] UH, SORRY, BAD JOKE. [clearing throat] WELL, STRANGULATION IS THE CLASSIC REPRESENTATION OF AN ATTEMPT TO SHUT SOMEONE OR SOMETHING UP FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT PARTICULAR SOMEONE OR SOMETHING MEANS TO THE KILLER. SLASHING AND MUTILATION COULD BE ANYTHING. MAYBE HE THINKS HE'S RELEASING HIS VICTIMS' SPIRITS. IT'S HARD TO SAY. THAT'S ALL? FOR NOW. IF I COME UP WITH ANYTHING ELSE, I'LL CALL YOU. ALL RIGHT, THANKS. I APPRECIATE THE TIME. SAM, HOW'RE THINGS AT HOME? FINE. NEVER BETTER. WE'RE SEPARATED. LOOK, I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS, DETECTIVE DIETZ. BUT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY WERE CRIME VICTIMS. AND IT'S TIME YOU CAME TO GRIPS WITH THAT. SAM, COME TALK TO ME BEFORE IT EATS YOU UP INSIDE. YOU'RE STARTING TO SOUND LIKE CAROL. I'LL HANDLE IT. FOR ME, IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL. ONE DIFFERENCE: SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, YOUR BUSINESS BLED ALL OVER YOUR FAMILY LIFE, RIGHT? I KNOW, DOC. I SAID I'LL HANDLE IT, I'LL HANDLE IT. "JAMAICA. FEELIN' DEAD? FEEL ALIVE!" YEAH. MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE A VACATION, HUH? WHAT DO YOU SAY, CAROL? THEY'RE ALREADY DEAD. THAT'S IT. THEY'RE ALREADY DEAD. YEAH, CAROL-ANN FRANCO, PLEASE. OH, WHEN WILL SHE BE BACK? A COUPLE OF MONTHS? OK. NO, FINE. NO MESSAGE. BYE. IS THIS, UH, 615-555-2737? IT IS. AND YOU'RE SURE THERE'S NO STEPHEN LOUIS THERE? YEAH, I--I BELIEVE YOU, LADY. IS BILL THERE? UH, DO YOU KNOW WHEN HE'LL BE BACK? BEGINNING OF NEXT MONTH, RIGHT. HE'S OUT OF TOWN, HUH? OK, BYE. IT IS? UM, SHE'S NOT THERE. OH, HE'S IN EUROPE? GOOD FOR HIM. NO, NO, THERE'S, UH... THERE'S NO MESSAGE. NO MESSAGE. NO, NO MESSAGE. RIGHT. THIS NUMBER'S BEEN DISCONNECTED AND THERE'S NO NEW NUMBER. I GOT YOU, VALSONE. I GOT YOU. RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO, I KNEW SOMETHING STUNK. NO REPORTS ON THE VICTIMS' RELATIVES IN HIS WORKING FILES, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, VALSONE GIVES THEM TO ME. BUT WHEN I CALLED THE NUMBERS, NOBODY'S HOME. NO ONE. NOW VALSONE CLAIMS THERE'S NOTHING LINKIN' THE VICTIMS TOGETHER, HUH? BUT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHIN'. YOU KNOW WHAT LINKS THE 2 L.A. VICTIMS TOGETHER? THEY'RE BOTH DEAD. WHAT? WITNESS PROTECTION, SIR. THE VICTIMS WERE IN THE FEDERAL WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM, AND I'LL BET MY ASS THE KILLER'S ANOTHER F.B.I. AGENT. SOMEBODY WHO HAD ACCESS TO A LIST. ARE YOU INSANE? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD A PHYSICAL? SIR, IT'S NOT THAT. LOOK, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HAVING TROUBLES AT HOME. SIR, EVERYTHING FITS. WHO USES DEAD PEOPLES' IDENTITIES TO MAKE NEW IDENTITIES, HUH? WHAT? THE WITNESS RELOCATION. THAT'S IT. DIETZ, YOU GOTTA GET FOCUSSED ON THIS THING. [Sam] I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. IT WASN'T MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THE VICTIMS' NAMES COME UP ON THE COMPUTER, THEY'RE ALREADY DEAD. [Rivers] IT'S A COMPUTER GLITCH. NOT ACCORDING TO THE GUY WHO RAN THE PROFILES. I DON'T KNOW, SAM. I GUESS I COULD MAKE A CALL TO IBSEN OVER AT THE FEDERAL BUILDING. NO, NO. YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THE F.B.I.'S NOT GONNA ADMIT SOMEONE'S KILLING PEOPLE THEY'VE SWORN TO PROTECT. VALSONE'S PROOF OF THAT. YOU'RE SAYING THIS GUY'S DELIBERATELY QUEERING THE INVESTIGATION? HE SET OFF MY JERK ALARM THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM. WHO THE HELL KNOWS WHAT HIS AGENDA IS? SAM, EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT, I'VE GOTTA HAVE PROOF BEFORE I CAN GO ACCUSING THE FEDS OF THIS KIND OF COVERUP. CAREERS COULD BE LOST IF YOU'RE WRONG. SIR, I PROMISE YOU I WILL GIVE YOU PROOF. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND VALSONE'S LEADING US NOWHERE. [sighing] LOOK. DON'T DO ANYTHING FOR A WHILE. -RIGHT. -LET ME MAKE A FEW PHONE CALLS. OK. JUST GIVE ME TILL TOMORROW MORNING. I WILL. BUT DON'T CONFRONT VALSONE ABOUT IT, PLEASE. AND BE, YOU KNOW, COOL WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR ENQUIRIES. SAM, I'LL BE CIRCUMSPECT. YOU'RE THE ONE WHO NEEDS TO BE COOL. RIGHT, SIR. I WILL. I'M GONNA COME UP WITH SOME PAPERWORK THAT'S GONNA KICK HIM RIGHT IN THE ASS. THANK YOU. [door opening] [Valsone] PRODUCTIVE MEETING WITH DR. PARK? OH, VERY. YOU CAN'T IMAGINE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW? I'M GONNA KNOCK OFF. IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU. GO HOME AND BE WITH MY SON. YOU WANT TO COME OVER FOR SOME PIZZA? I'LL PASS. WELL, I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW MORNING, BRIGHT AND EARLY. [coughing] [chuckling] [police siren wailing] [thumping] [pulley wheel creaking] [woman gasping] [woman screaming] WHO? WHO'S DRIVING? -I WASN'T DRIVING. -TURN AROUND. THE WORLD'S ROTTEN, CAESAR. ...LIKE THIS, POINT YOUR FINGERS. [woman] WHEN DID THEY TELL YOU IT'D BE AVAILABLE? [man] UH, FIRST OF THE MONTH. [clerk] MUST YOU BRING THAT DOG IN HERE? I'VE BEEN MUGGED TWICE. IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN. [phone ringing] MR. GRAZINSKY? [knocking at door] MR. GRAZINSKY, CAN I CLEAN THE ROOM? [screaming] [dog growling] [yelling] [barking] [snarling] [crashing] CALL FOR BACKUP. MEET ME UPSTAIRS. [car horn honking] UNIT 12 TO DISPATCH. [car alarm ringing] NEED BACKUP AT THE HOTEL ON THE CORNER OF 4TH AND PARK. PARK PLAZA HOTEL. AND SEND AN ANIMAL CONTROL UNIT. MA'AM, PLEASE GO BACK DOWN TO THE LOBBY. MA'AM! [man groaning] JIMMY.

[knocking at door] COME. GOOD MORNING. PERRY, DETECTIVE SAM DIETZ. IBSEN. OH, LIKE THE PLAYWRIGHT. SIT DOWN, SAM. GENTLEMEN, WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE IS IRON THIS OUT AMONG US BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE HAS TO BE BROUGHT IN. SO IT PANNED OUT, I WAS RIGHT? SAM, IT DIDN'T PAN OUT. PERRY BROUGHT US A COMPLETE LIST OF EVERYBODY IN THE L.A. BASIN THAT'S IN THE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM. NONE OF THE NAMES MATCH. NOT EVEN CLOSE. SO WHAT DOES THAT PROVE? NAMES ARE JUST NAMES. I WANNA SEE A FINGERPRINT MATCH. IT'S NOT NECESSARY. ALL OUR WITNESS PROTECTION PEOPLE ARE STILL IN PLACE. THEY'RE ALL ALIVE, THEY'RE ALL HEALTHY. BESIDES THAT, DETECTIVE, YOUR BASIC ASSUMPTION IS WHOLLY INCORRECT. WE HAVEN'T USED DECEASED PEOPLE'S IDENTITIES IN THE WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM FOR YEARS. TOO MANY LOOSE ENDS. WELL, THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT. BECAUSE 2 OF THEM ARE DEAD. THEY WERE MURDERED. WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT IT IS RIGHT. AS FAR AS AGENT VALSONE MISDIRECTING THE INVESTIGATION, I'VE REVIEWED ALL HIS PROCEDURES AND THEY'RE ALL STRICTLY ACCORDING TO THE BOOK. SAM, LOOKS LIKE YOU SERIOUSLY JUMPED THE GUN ON THIS ONE. [Ibsen] WELL, IF THAT'S EVERYTHING, GENTLEMEN... SEE YOU AT THE MAYOR'S PARTY, JOHN. RIGHT, PERRY, AND THANKS. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, JUST LET US KNOW. THANK YOU, SIR. AH, WAIT-- WAIT A MINUTE. I WANT TO SEE THAT LIST. IT'S FAR TOO SENSITIVE, I'M AFRAID I CAN'T LET YOU DO THAT. SAM, YOU DON'T NEED TO SEE THE LIST. I'VE SEEN THE LIST. AND YOU CAN TAKE MY WORD FOR IT-- NO. I'M NOT TAKING ANYBODY'S WORD FOR ANYTHING ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT? THEY'RE LYING, YOU CAN'T SEE IT? I TOLD YOU THEY WOULDN'T COP TO IT, AND YOU'RE PLAYING THEIR GODDAMN GAME JUST LIKE SOME LITTLE POLITICAL BOY. DIETZ, YOU'RE OUTTA LINE. IF YOU DON'T MOVE OUT OF MY WAY, DETECTIVE, I'M STILL VERY CAPABLE OF MOVIN' YOU. COME ON, PERRY, I'LL WALK YOU TO THE CAR. BETTER HAVE A TALK WITH YOUR MAN HERE, JOHN. DISCUSS WHAT THESE UNFOUNDED ACCUSATIONS COULD MEAN TO HIS CAREER. [door closing] YOU IDIOT. YOU'RE GONNA SIT HERE AND TELL THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF THE GODDAMN F.B.I. THAT HE'S LYIN' ABOUT THIS? DO YOU WANT ME TO SUSPEND YOU? SAM, WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU LATELY? SAM. DIETZ! YOU WERE GREAT IN THERE. NICE WORK, DETECTIVE. [men chattering] YOU THINK THIS IS REALLY GONNA STOP ME, HUH, VALSONE? [sighing] DON'T MAKE IT WORSE ON YOURSELF. YOU'RE DIRTY. I KNOW IT AND YOU KNOW IT. YOU'RE OUT OF CONTROL. I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU YET. [groans] OK, THAT'S ENOUGH. I'VE TRIED TO WORK WITH YOU, I'VE GIVEN YOU EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE. I'VE EVEN HAD TO PUT UP WITH YOUR CHILDISH BEHAVIOR AND YOUR STUPID FUCKING ACCUSATIONS. [whispering] YOU BACK OFF BEFORE YOU BURY YOURSELF. [phone ringing] [people chattering] [grunts] JESUS, DIETZ, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M DONE. DIETZ! YOU'RE SUSPENDED PENDING A DISCIPLINARY HEARING. AH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOTHER WITH THAT STUFF, CAPTAIN, 'CAUSE I DON'T THINK I WANT TO BE A COP HERE NO MORE. ALL RIGHT, IT'S OVER. GET BACK TO WORK. LET'S GO. [water running] YO, TAG, SEE DIETZ? WHY, WHAT IS IT? POSSIBLE VICTIM IN A HOTEL DOWNTOWN. WAIT A MINUTE, I'M GOING WITH YOU. [camera clicking] AGENT VALSONE, I WAS THINKING THAT, UH... WHAT WAS THAT? WOULD YOU LIKE ONE? NO, NO THANKS. THIS MURDER'S NOT CONNECTED TO OUR CASE. WHOA--WHOA-- THE M.O'S NOT THE SAME. WAIT, HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT? NO SYMBOLS ON THE WALLS. LET'S GO, DETECTIVE, WE'VE GOT A LOT TO DO TODAY. WRAP IT UP. ♪♪♪[music playing] [people chattering] PRETTY WILD STUFF IN THOSE PERSONALS, HUH? BURN THE BURGER A LITTLE LONGER. YEAH, YEAH. MORE COFFEE? SEE YOU LATER, TOBY HONEY. STAY SWEET. CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE? SOME APPLE PIE? A MUFFIN? ♪♪♪[rock music playing] [music stops] CAN YOU HEAR ME? I GOTTA GET OVER TO THE NEXT SET OF HOUSES. IF WE DON'T CATCH UP, I'M GONNA LOSE THIS CONTRACT. WHY DON'T YOU GO THERE AND FINISH THE MAIN WALL? THE INSPECTOR'S COMIN'. OK, TED. [plane engine roaring] [yelling] [choking] [grunts] GREGOR? [grunting] I PLAYED RIGHT INTO YOUR FUCKIN' HANDS, VALSONE. SOME DETECTIVE I TURNED OUT TO BE, HUH, PARTNER? [police siren wailing] OH, BUT I'M SUPPOSE TO CALL BEFORE I COME OVER, RIGHT? WHAT IF I HAD SOMEBODY HERE? I TRIED TO REACH YOU ALL DAY, SAM. I JUST NEED MY BANK BOOK AND THE DEED TO THE HOUSE. ON THE TABLE. DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE. OBVIOUSLY. SORRY. [Sam] HEY, THAT'S EVIDENCE. NO, THIS IS MY BANK BOOK. THAT'S EVIDENCE. THIS IS NOT MY BANK BOOK. WHAT DID THIS PERSON DO FOR A LIVING, SAM? SHE'S IN REAL ESTATE. PATRICK FARGANO IS A FEMALE REAL ESTATE AGENT? NO, HE WAS A GARAGE MECHANIC. OK. BYE. UM, REMEMBER, 3:00? SAM? WHAT'S THE MATTER? NOTHING. I COLD-COCKED AN F.B.I. AGENT. I THINK I'VE BEEN FIRED. SAM. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? [sighs] TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, CAROL, I REALLY DON'T KNOW. OH, HONEY, I'M SORRY. MMM. [knocking at door] SAM. [Paul] YOU IN THERE? SAM, SAM. HE'LL GO AWAY. HE'LL GO AWAY. [Paul] SAM, IT'S ME. I GOTTA GET GOING. THIS COULD BE NICE. I KNOW. HI, PAUL. OH, HI, CAROL. IT'S A GOOD THING YOU DON'T SCHEDULE AIRLINE FLIGHTS, 'CAUSE YOUR TIMIN' SUCKS. MAN, I'M SORRY. [sighing] LOOK, I GOTTA PICK EVERYTHING UP. VALSONE WANTS THE WORKING FILES AND THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE BACK AT THE PRECINCT. AND HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS SUCH A GOOD IDEA FOR HIM TO COME HERE. OH, HE WAS RIGHT. YEAH, I SEE. BE MY GUEST. [sighs] HEY, DID YOU CHECK THIS GUY'S FINANCES? YEAH, SURE. WHAT ABOUT THESE DEPOSITS? $1,500 EVERY MONTH. I THOUGHT FOR A WHILE IT MIGHT BE DRUG MONEY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT IT DIDN'T PAN OUT. THE GUY PULLS DOWN WHAT? WHAT, $425 A WEEK AFTER TAXES? YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. MAYBE LESS. WELL, WHY THE HELL DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THIS? JESUS, SAM. I CHECKED IT, ALL RIGHT? I MEAN, THE GUY WAS ONLY KILLED THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY. I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO FOLLOW IT UP. VALSONE'S BEEN--BEEN RUNNING ME AROUND LIKE HIS PERSONAL ERRAND BOY. YEAH, I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE, MAN. I'M SORRY. HE'S LEAVIN', YOU KNOW. WHO? VALSONE. HE'S TURNIN' THE CASE OVER TO LOCAL FEDS. DID HE SAY WHY? YEAH, HE SAYS ACCORDING TO THE KILLER'S M.O., HE WON'T BE WORKIN' THIS AREA MUCH LONGER. WANTS TO GET DOWN TO SAN DIEGO, GET THINGS SET UP THERE. REALLY? THAT'S INTERESTING. THE POINT IS, SAM: WITH JERK-OFF GONE, YOU GET YOUR JOB BACK. KISS RIVERS' ASS A LITTLE BIT AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE AGAIN. WE'LL SEE. WHAT ABOUT THAT? OH, YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING. OH, NO, SAM. HEY, COME ON, LET ME TAKE ONE OF THOSE. I THINK YOU'VE TAKEN ENOUGH ALREADY, SAM. GET THAT OUT OF SIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU JUST APOLOGIZE AND TAKE YOUR LUMPS? HUH? I MEAN, YOU'RE TOO GOOD A COP TO LET IT END THIS WAY. 'CAUSE IT'S NOT OVER YET, PAULIE. IT'S NOT OVER YET. [woman on intercom] 27 CHARLES. 27 CHARLES. COME IN. TAGLIA. [woman on radio] WE GOT A 187 AT A CONSTRUCTION SITE, 703 SEASIDE. AGENT VALSONE'LL MEET YOU THERE ROGER. I GUESS OUR KILLER DIDN'T HEAR THAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO HEAD TO SAN DIEGO. [car door shuts] UM, CALL ME ABOUT THAT LATER. WILL YOU, PAUL? YEAH, IF I CAN. LOOK, THINK ABOUT WHAT I SAID. ALL RIGHT, SAM? I WILL. [sighs] [sighs] IT'S NOT THE DEPOSITS, DUMMY. IT'S THE BANKS. BOTH HAVE THE SAME BANKS. [dialing] [phone rings] [Francine] CAPT. RIVERS' OFFICE. FRANCINE. DIETZ. HI, SAM. I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. I NEED A FAVOR. I NEED THE NAME OF THE VICTIM OF THE LATEST 187 THAT TAGLIA JUST RESPONDED TO. IT'S PROBABLY NOT IN YET. AND EVEN IF IT WAS, I CAN'T. FRANCINE, PLEASE. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. I'LL CALL YOU BACK. I'M AT MY APARTMENT. THANKS. I CAN ALMOST SMELL THAT PERFUME FROM HERE. GIVE IT A REST, DIETZ. [police siren wailing] [people chattering] HE'S UP THERE, SIR. SLOW DOWN, ROOKIE. HE'S ALREADY DEAD. YES, SIR. CHECK HIS APARTMENT, IT'S IN HOLLYWOOD. I'LL MEET YOU THERE IN FEW MINUTES. I'LL SEE YOU THERE. [police radio chattering] [inaudible] [thumping continues] [ringing] FRANCINE? NO, IT'S ME. I JUST, UH, PICKED CORY UP FROM SCHOOL, AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO THE COUNSELOR. ARE YOU COMING? I CAN'T. WHY NOT, SAM? [beeps] -I THOUGHT WE HAD A-- -LOOK, CAROL. L-L-LET ME GET THIS CALL AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER, HUH? DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. SO WILL I. [clicking] [dial tone buzzing] [Francine] HELLO, DIETZ? DIETZ? YEAH, I'M HERE, FRANCINE. WHAT DO YOU GOT? [thudding] OH, FUCK, DIETZ. WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE? I THINK I FOUND A CONNECTION. I JUST NEED TO LOCK IT UP. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT? VALSONE IS RIGHT BEHIND ME. HOW SOON? 2, 3 MINUTES. WHO KNOWS? GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE, WILL YOU? LOOK FOR A BANK BOOK OR A BANK STATEMENT. THE 2 L.A. VICTIMS HAD THE SAME BANK, SAME BRANCH. WHAT'S THE ODDS, HUH? I DON'T KNOW, BUT SO WHAT? COME ON, LOOK, PAULIE. THESE ARE WITNESS PROTECTION PEOPLE LIKE I SAID. MAY BE THE FEDS ARE PAYING 'EM OUT OF THE SAME BANK. I CAN CHECK AND VERIFY THAT. JESUS, SAM. HEY, DURING WORLD WAR II, THE NAZIS PAID THEIR SPIES OUT OF THE SAME BANK. I READ IT SOMEWHERE. YOU READ IT SOMEWHERE? OH, JESUS, YOU REALLY ARE OVER THE EDGE. YES! 3 VICTIMS, SAME BANK, SAME BRANCH. OVER THE EDGE, HUH? [Sam] THERE'S VALSONE. OH, SHIT. I'LL BE WATCHING HIM. IF HE'S DIRTY, I'M GONNA PROVE IT, ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. GO, GO, GO. HEY, REMEMBER WHAT I SAID. GET OUT OF HERE. ANYTHING GOOD? NO, NOTHIN' YET. [sighing] UH, COULD YOU OPEN THE DOOR? OFFICIAL BUSINESS. I SHOWED YOU MINE, YOU SHOWED ME YOURS. DON'T PUT A... OPEN THE DOOR! [beeping] ARE YOU GOING TO MAIL ANYTHING? NO. WELL THEN, WOULD YOU STAND AWAY FROM THE BOX WHILE I UNLOAD IT? YEAH. [clattering] I WONDER IF HE PLAYS POKER. [people chattering] [woman] THANK YOU. [man whistles] [tires screeching] [car approaching] [car trunk shuts] [car horn honks] [phone rings] [woman] L.A. TRIBUNE. PERSONAL ADS. [beeping] [phone rings] [man] FAIRFAX F.B.I. AGENT MORRIS HERE. CAN I HELP YOU? [beeping] [phone ringing] [man] SOVIET EMBASSY. WHO DID YOU SAY THIS WAS? SOVIET EMBASSY. WHO DO YOU WISH TO SPEAK TO? NO--NO--NO. WRONG NUMBER. [beeps] [beeping] [phone ringing] [Paul] TAGLIA. PAULIE, DIETZ. LISTEN, MAN, CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR? [phone ringing] VALSONE HERE. [Sam] YOU SOUND PRETTY CLEAR. THIS IS A NICE PHONE. I'M BUSY, DIETZ. WHAT'S UP? OH, YOU PACKIN', HUH? WELL, YOU BETTER LOOK OUT THE WINDOW BEFORE YOU GO. [sighing] WE GOTTA TALK, DIETZ. HOW COME YOU GOT THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN WASHINGTON PROGRAMMED INTO YOUR PHONE? I GET INVITED TO A LOT OF SOCIAL FUNCTIONS. [laughing] [phone dialing] HEY, GUESS WHAT I GOT IN MY HAND? YOUR DISCONNECTED BRAIN. ACTUALLY, IT'S YOUR BALLS. CAN YOU FEEL ME SQUEEZIN' 'EM? GET THERAPY, DIETZ. ALL 3 VICTIMS HAD THE SAME BANK, SAME BRANCH. SO? SO THAT'S A CORRELATION EVEN CAPT. RIVERS CAN'T IGNORE. AND THESE ENVELOPES ARE GOING TO PROVE IT. THEY'RE ADDRESSED TO F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS, THE L.A. TRIBUNE,[/\I] AND THE POLICE COMMISSIONER, AND MY MOTHER. YOU KNOW, WE'RE A LOT ALIKE, YOU AND I. EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T SEE IT. ALL RIGHT, YOU SHOOT ME, THESE DROP. "NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY"? THAT'S RIGHT. I'M A BIG GOVERNMENT SPOOK. AND YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE GOING TO REBUILD THE BERLIN WALL ALL BY YOURSELF IF YOU DROP THOSE IN. YOU'RE A REAL WORK OF ART, YOU KNOW THAT, VALSONE? LET'S DISCUSS THIS IN MY ROOM. I'M NOT MOVIN' TILL I HEAR SOMETHING THAT MAKES SOME SENSE. YOU KNOW, YOU ARE SO CONVINCED THAT I'M THE BAD GUY IN ALL OF THIS, THAT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THE TRUTH EVEN IF IT SMACKED YOU ACROSS THE FACE. TRY ME. I'M NOT WIRED. [beeping] THERE'S 3 PHASES TO GLASNOST: REDUCTION IN TACTICAL WEAPONS, STANDING ARMY, AND ALL COVERT OPERATIONS. NOW, YOU COULD STOCKPILE NUCLEAR WARHEADS. WHERE DO SPIES GO WHEN NOBODY NEEDS THEM ANYMORE? MISSILES, AND SOLDIERS, AND SPIES. OH, MY. HEY, YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO THE TRUTH, OR DO YOU WANT TO BE A WISE-ASS? THIS IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN SOME INSIGNIFICANT MURDERS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT WITNESS PROTECTION, YOU SIMPLETON. THE KILLER IS SPETSNAZ, SOVIET SPECIAL FORCES. HIS JOB WAS TO COME HERE AND BRING BACK SOVIET SPIES WHO DON'T WANT TO COME IN FROM THE COLD. THE PROBLEM IS, HE'S TAKEN OUT THE ENTIRE NETWORK, EVEN THE ONES THAT AGREE WITH GLASNOST. [sighing] MY MISSION IS TO HELP THE SOVIETS BRING HIM IN. MUTILATIONS, SYMBOLS. I CAN'T BUY THAT. WHY? BECAUSE YOU MAY BE WRONG, OR BECAUSE IT'S COMIN' FROM ME? WHICH IS IT, DETECTIVE? HUH? WHO ELSE KNOWS ABOUT THIS? THE F.B.I. PROVIDES A DOMESTIC CUT-UP AND NOBODY'S GOT ALL THE PIECES. BUT CAPT. RIVERS, HE'S GOING TO BE BRIEFED ON THIS SOVIET STUFF? HE'S ON A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS ONLY. BELIEVE ME, HE NEEDS TO KNOW. I WANT MY JOB BACK. DEAL? DEAL. [Valsone] WE'LL TAKE YOUR CAR. [Sam] AW, I LOVE IT WHEN YOU DRIVE. MAY I SEE THE INFORMATION? THANKS. THESE ARE BLANK PAGES. REALLY? OH, YEAH. [grunts] [groans] ALL RIGHT, HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, ASSHOLE. DON'T MOVE. ALL RIGHT, STEP AWAY FROM HIM. REAL SLOW. [Paul groaning] [footsteps approaching] [groaning] [Sam coughing] SLEEPING BEAUTY AWAKES. [groaning] THAT'S FOR THE MEN'S ROOM. OH. [groans] THAT'S FOR NOT LISTENING WHEN I TOLD YOU TO BACK OFF. YOU'RE WAY OUT OF YOUR PAY GRADE, DIETZ. THE COLONEL IS DOING US ALL A FAVOR. HE'S EXPANDING HIS MISSION. TAKIN' OUT EVERY SOVIET SLEEPER THEY HAVE HERE. HE LIKES IT. SO DO I. THIS IS YOUR BASIC COUNTER-INSURGENCE MOVE. WHEN THE BAD GUYS ARE BEATING THEMSELVES, YOU DON'T INTERFERE. YOU LIED ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LINE, DIDN'T YOU, VALSONE? YEAH, JUST CHANGED A FEW THINGS, THAT'S ALL. THE SYMBOLS WERE MESSAGES TO YOUR GUYS. IN BLOOD. JUST TO CONFUSE THE INVESTIGATION. IF IT LOOKS LIKE A SERIAL KILLER, IT MUST BE A SERIAL KILLER. IT'S CALLED "HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT," DIETZ. WHY DIDN'T YOU KILL HIM YOURSELF, VALSONE? YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE ENJOYED IT. I DO WHAT THE MISSIONS CALL FOR. AND THE MAIN MISSION HERE, IS TO NOT LET THESE COMMUNIST ASSHOLES SELL US DOWN THE RIVER WITH THIS GLASNOST BULLSHIT. YOU SPEND TIME IN THE JUNGLE, DIETZ, YOU LEARN THAT A LEOPARD CAN'T CHANGE ITS SPOTS. I'M SICK TO DEATH OF ACCOUNTANTS MAKING POLICY. IVAN IS EVERYBODY'S NEW BUDDY, RIGHT? BULLSHIT. HE EATS GUYS LIKE YOU FOR LUNCH. YOU'RE A SICK FUCK. I'M A PRO. AND A PRO WOULD'VE POPPED YOU WITH A SILENCED WEAPON. POP! NO MUSS, NO FUSS. THE COLONEL'S GOT A SET PATTERN AND I DON'T WANT TO BLOW HIS COVER. [Sam] HE'S A SICK FUCK, TOO. [Valsone] HE'S SPETSNAZ. ALL FOREBRAIN. NO EMOTION. HE'S JUST FOLLOWING ORDERS, LIKE THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS FUCKED-UP WORLD. [groaning] AH, ANYWAY, DIETZ. HERE'S A THOUGHT YOU COULD TAKE WITH YOU. YOU DID YOUR DUTY, AND THAT'S A HARD THING THESE DAYS. I KNOW. [clicking] [gun firing] [gun cocks] [Russian accent] THIS PERSON LIVES, AND THIS PERSON DIES. OR THIS PERSON LIVES, AND THIS PERSON DIES. WHO MAKES THOSE CHOICES, DETECTIVE? HIM? YOU? ME? YESTERDAY'S HERO SHOULD NOT BECOME TOMORROW'S TRAITOR SIMPLY BECAUSE OF SOME CHANGE IN IDEOLOGY. [yells] I CAN'T JUST LET YOU WALK OUT OF HERE, MAN. [groans] [phone ringing] [Carol] HELLO? [Sam] IT'S ME. OH. IT'S A LITTLE LATE NOW, SAM. LET'S TALK TOMORROW. DON'T HANG UP, CAROL. I WAS AT THE HOSPITAL. I GOT SHOT. WHAT? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? WHY DIDN'T THEY CALL ME? OH, I TOLD THEM NOT TO CALL YOU. I'M OK. CORY AND I WILL BE RIGHT OVER, SAM. [beeps] YOU WANT TO GET THAT CALL? NO, THEY CAN WAIT. LISTEN, CAROL. I'VE BEEN THINKIN'. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN A, UH... I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, LET'S TALK WHEN YOU GET HERE, HUH? WE'LL TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING. OK, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE, SAM. UH, MAKE THAT... SHERRIFF SAM. REALLY? [sniffling] WHY ARE YOU CRYING? I DON'T KNOW. I LOVE YOU, SAM. I LOVE YOU, TOO, BABY.
