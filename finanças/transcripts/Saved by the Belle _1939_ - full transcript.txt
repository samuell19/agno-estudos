[♪] [SNORING] [YAWNS] [RUMBLING] [MAKES CLICKING NOISE] Hey, Joe. Oh, hello, Mike. Has the ammunition arrived? Yeah. It's safely stored in the hills. Are you ready to lead us against President Robey? Sure, I can close up the hotel anytime now. The only guests left are three American salesmen. I'm gonna ask them to pay up and get out. [SNORING] Hey, here's a couple of live wire prospects. This one won't be interested. I think he's dead. Get these things unpacked. Look, you guys unpack 'em, I'll put the high pressure on him. Pardon me, but we represent the King Winter Outfitting Company of Ticonderoga. Manufacturers of imported wearing apparel. And just to prove our clothes are fresh, you can still smell the ocean. Believe it or not. What do you mean? I got an idea. Nyuck, nyuck. Well, it better be a good one. Now, pal, we got a lot of stuff here that nobody's seen yet. Now, here's something very chic in a kimono. Now, here's a little article you can't do without in this part of the country. What is that? Watch. Ah-ah-ah. So what? My latest invention-- A shock absorber for earthquakes. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. The trade in value on this is twice as much-- Listen, that guy ain't gonna buy anything. What are we gonna do? The boss don't send us dough, we'll be stranded. What's that? I, um-- I was just tellin' my pal here, this is lovely country and I'm glad we landed. How are you, Mr. Singapore? Look, the cold weather's setting in and I've decided to close the hotel for the winter. Your bill. Hey, come here, you. Who had that last beer? Not me, I had that one with all the foam. Well, I had this one. I had that one. [ARGUING INDISTINCTLY] Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hey, will you please pay that bill and get out? Well, I'll tell ya-- You see, we were expecting a cablegram from the front office. Oh, I forgot. Your message came this morning. Oh, thanks. Heh, I've been waitin' for it. So they sent you the money, eh? Well, not exactly, you see, this wire's-- [MACHINE GUN FIRE] Hey, what was that? What, that? They're executing some guy that didn't pay his debts. It's the law in this country. Well, he deserves it. That last round reminded me, I've got money in my dresser. What do you say, we go get it? All of us. Okay. Come on. Come on. The dough is in the top drawer of the dresser in the jewel box. You wait here, I'll get it. I'll help him. I'll help him. Oh, no, you don't. You wait here, I'll go in and get it. What kind of fool do you take me for? Why, is there more than one kind? Superstitious, eh? He don't know what's happening. [POUNDING] Open this door! [CHATTERING] Thank you, thank you. Another satisfied customer. Right this way, folks. Come this way, folks. Here we are. Hey, you. Have you got a peddler's license? Peddler's license? Certainly not. We're salesmen-- Super salesmen. Oh, salesmen, eh? How do I know you're not spies? BIRD: Spies? [LAUGHS] Excuse me, general. Hey, wait a minute. Don't you harm a feather in his bed-- Uh, I mean, head. We're not spies, don't be silly. We're selling earthquake shock absorbers. And doin' rather well too. Look. You'll have to come with me for questioning to General Casino. But we don't play casino. How about a little rummy? [CHATTERING] Hey, listen-- Hey, keep an eye on those samples, will ya? Whoo-whoo-whoo. Ooh. Spies, eh? ALL: Oh, no-- Quiet! But, general, the fat one does not look like a spy. He looks very innocent. Oh, I don't know, I've been around. Oh, ooh. Do you really think they're innocent? I am sure, my general. Well, you may go free, gentleman. Oh, thanks, general. Thanks. Hey, I told you he'd bring us luck. BIRD: Why don't you search them, general? Wait. That's a good idea. Search them. Don't forget, anything you find is 50-50. Oh. Here's a message, general. CASINO: "No passage money until you get rid of present wardrobe." So get rid of President Ward Robey, eh? So then you are spies. Throw 'em in the dungeon and shoot them at sunrise. Wait a minute, now. Hey, listen, get him an interpreter. That buzzard did bring us luck, eh? Hey, come on, will ya? Hey, guys, you got a shoehorn? Ow, ow. This is all your fault. Fine last supper. This is the hardest bread I ever saw. Listen. [KNOCKS] Come in. Hey, muttonhead, what are you doin'? I'm tryin' to make the alarm work. What for? We're gonna be shot at sunrise and I wanna make sure we don't oversleep. Oh. [ALARM RINGS] MOE: It's working now, all right. Hey. Hey. Psst.

Whoo-whoo-whoo. And soup. Oh, sweetheart, you're wonderful. Oh. Ooh. Oh, boy, soup. Soup, we ain't got time for that. We want to get to the solid food. Let's give it to the guard. He's a nice guy. That's a good idea. You've almost got a brain. CURLY: Oh, thank you. Heh-heh. Hey, you like soup? No. No like soap. I didn't say soap, you lug. Soup. Soup. Soup? Oh, sure. Well, take it. Thank you. Ignoramus. Let me at that food. Hey, where's your manners? [CRUNCHING] [GASPS] [WHIMPERS] A note. "This will help you to escape. "Meet me behind the jail. I have work for you to do. Rita." Come on, bring the saws. Come on. [CLANKING] Hey, shh. Quiet. You want the guard to hear you? [SLURPS] Listen. [SLURPS] That gives me an idea. Give me a blade. Ready? [SLURPS] [SLURPS] [SLURPS] [SLURPS] [RUMBLING] Boy, that was some shake. The biggest one yet. Hey do you fellas feel a draft? Why, certainly. It's from that hole over there. Oh. Come on, get busy. Boys. Come on. Be right with ya, toots. We'll be finished in a minute. Don't go away. Come on, you dummies. Shh. The map is in the desk. Whoo-whoo-whoo. Shh. Come on. What's the idea? I just can't stand to have anybody look over my shoulder. Oh. Look. Is this it? Ah, yes. This is the map of President Robey's palace. You must take this to our leader, and he will see that you are rewarded. Good, now we can get the money and go home. I ain't so sure I want to go home now. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Yow. Quiet, you dumbbell. Where does your leader live? His camp is in the hills. What are we waitin' for? Come on. [BARKS LIKE DOG] [RUMBLING] The map, the map-- I lost the map. It's under the couch.

The sun will be up in a few minutes and we can get our bearings. Gee, the sun rises quick in this part of the country. Say, seems like we passed this spot some time ago. Yeah, I can tell by the windows and the building. Hm. Hey, fellas, look. We've been robbed. Just our luck. There's a horse, we can use him. Come on. I knew this car ran kind of smooth. Hurry up. Get goin', boys. Come on, we gotta get on on this side. Hey, fellas, look. A four-legged V8. Never mind that. Come on, mount. Come on, let's go. [♪] Take us to your chief quick.

Well, bring 'em in. All right. Come on. Now, my friend, we'll have some action. [CHUCKLES] STOOGES: Nyah-ah. You. Take 'em out and have 'em shot. Now, wait a minute, Joe. We got a message here from Rita. Ah, the map. Well, that's different. Come, my friends. Eat, drink, and be merry. Whoo-whoo-whoo. Where's Mary? Sit down. At last, success is ours. Idiots. Blunderers. Take a look at that. Take them out and have 'em shot. Oh, no, please. We can explain. Wait. The boys made a mistake. I have the real map. Rita, that's fine. It's a good thing I found the right map. Won't you sit down and pick a bone with us? [CHUCKLES] [HAWS] Oh. Say, what's the idea? I bet he wouldn't do that. Would you? Sure. Oh. He did. [HONKS[ [WHIMPERS] That's it, all right. Rita, you're wonderful, but you guys die at sunrise. Oh, but you cannot shoot my friends. They did their best. You should reward them. All right. I'll give them commissions in the army. Commissions? Not me. Straight salary or nothin'. Wait a minute, wait a minute. You know I'm temperamental. Yeah, 95 percent temper, 5 percent mental. And how. Huh? Here you are, gentlemen. Take these warrants to General LaGrande. He'll take care of you in a large manner. Oh, thanks. Show them the way. I'm gonna to make you a general. Hah-hah-hah.

Very well, gentlemen, we will take care this at once. Follow me. Allons. STOOGES: Hello. Oh, hello. I hope they give me a double-breasted suit, I'd look much thinner. Come on. Hm. Woodpeckers. Now, gentlemen. Stand against the wall, if you please. I wonder what's the big idea? Maybe they're gonna pin a medal on us. I know, maybe they're gonna take our picture for identification. Nyuck, nyuck. I gonna send one home to Elaine. Hah-hah. Attention. Some class. They're gonna fire a salute in our honor. That's swell. Say, we want 21 guns. Three will be sufficient, gentlemen.
