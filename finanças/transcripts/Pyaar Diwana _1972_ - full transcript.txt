Listen to me, Dolly. Dolly. She hung up. Hello. - Hello. Is it Bhagwanti Jethmalani? You didn't care about me. My beloved. Who the heck are you? It's me. Arjun's son. Abhimanyu Hingorani. Didn't you recognise me? Where are you speaking from? I'm standing outside Sterling theater with tickets. I'm sweating. Wear a garland and come to me. You didn't care about me. My beloved. Devil. - What is it? - Disgusting. What is all this? My dear. The twinkle of Rai Bahadur's eyes. People are cursing you everywhere. But uncle is discussed even more than me. If this carries on, Rai Bahadur will also get ruined along with you. Who is it? Seems like some new trouble. Not trouble. These are complainants. You see. I'll hide. Go. Go. Who is it? Hold on, will you? Who are you? What brings you here? Who do you want to meet? Is Sunil home? - This trouble was outside the house till now. Now it has come inside the house. No. There's no one called Suraj here. Leave. Who says I'm not there? I'm there. Oh. Meena. Sit. Sit. I thought it's someone else. Sit. - What is all this? Have some shame. If I didn't I have any shame why I come here to welcome them? Uncle, those who have guests like these are so fortunate. But... - No ifs and buts. Go arrange some refreshments. Go. Go. Tell me. - We're here for donation. Really? - For the temple. Really? There's a temple in my heart too. But we're talking about a temple where people in pain find peace. Peace(Shanti) - Did you say anything to me? Oh. So you're Shanti. Okay, tell me. Why do woman make you restless than give you peace? That's the luck of the draw. Luck. That reminds me. Meena, show me your hand. So you know palmistry too? Yes. I can tell you everything from your fate, your stars.. Your enemy to wealth and love. Really? Then read my hand first. Do you really eager to know your fortune? Her name is Shanti(peace). But her love story is in full of unrest. What do you mean? I mean her boyfriend is a little upset with her these days. Come on. - I have the remedy to it. That's enough. I've understood my future. Now read her palm. Yes. So this line... Sunil, enough the palmistry. Where is the donation? Keep quiet. Let me read her hand. I'll make donation as well. Come. So where were we? Here. So this line here... I've understood why you guys are here. What have you understood? We respect Rai Bahadur. Otherwise we would've taught.. Sunil a lesson he would never forget. - Yes. I understood even that. - What have you understood? He teases girls on the streets. My daughter was about to get married? Sunil spoke to her. Now how is she going to get married? Hello. - Hello. Is it Jenson And Nicolson etc. etc? Yes. - You? Pamela Tiffin. Having your tiffin? No. I'm Rita D'Souza. Impossible. Such a fine and beautiful voice. You're Pamela Tiffin. And not Rita D'Souza. - Shut up. You shut up. Can't you sit peacefully for a while? What news have you got, uncle? - Here's a letter. - Letter? Is it some girl's? Good news. Good news. Good news. His Highness uncle is coming. Now I'll have to go on an exile for a few days. Why do you need to do all that? Live here properly. Ram is off to the jungle. Ram is off to the jungle. Ram is off to the jungle. - I'm tired. - Master, you're now old. Traveling long distances at this age is not right. Rest for a few days. You're right. But there should be someone else who can.. Handle my forefather's business? Of course. Young master is an adult now. Ask him to join you. Let him finish his studies first. Studies? I suggest you ask him to join you. I'm afraid he might disgrace our family. What do you mean? I don't need to explain. Go see for yourself. See for myself? What? What is this? - Complaints. - Complaints? - Yes. There are two more sacks. The entire city has sent complaints against him. Look at this. You read my nephew's misdoings. If he had been my son, I would've shot him dead. He's the only remembrance of my late brother. The last heir of the family. I don't understand what I should do. With you permission, may I say something? Sure. That is why I have called all of you. There's only one way of bringing Sunil on the right track. What is that? - Rein him in. What? - Rein him in. I mean get him married. Get him married? - Yes. He'll get back to his senses as soon as he gets married. - He'll be her slave. - You've gone nuts. Who is going to marry a boy like him? Don't worry about it. I know of a girl. Girl? No. I don't want to ruin any girl's life by hiding the boy's shortcomings. Look, Sunil is naughty for sure. But he's not errant. If you concur with me come and see the girl. - Shekhar is right. - Shekhar is spot on. Yes. Shekhar is spot on. Here. Have tea. And you get up. You've spent the entire day in this. You've changed or had food. Get up. Go. - Go and rest. Go and rest. If this is what everyone's advice is then so be it. Why this formality? These are the customs. Tell me. Did you like the girl? Girl is very good. There's no question of disliking her. The boy is the problem. Think long and hard about him. Why would I have any objection since Shekhar has recommended him? In matters of marriage everything should be clear. This is the question of your daughter's life. I've told you everything about the boy. I don't want to marry him.. By hiding his shortcomings. You get worried for no reason. I've already told you that the boy has no shortcomings. He's a little naive. Everything's going to be alright after marriage. And we would never find such a high class family. The rest will be our daughter's luck. - Think hard once again. We approve. - Then the wedding should happen in this week. Make arrangements to call the boy. And well make rest of the arrangements. Thank you. Thief. Thief. Thief. Not the thief. The master. You? - Yes me. Where is uncle? - He's gone. - Gone? Then what will be of me? Who's going to pay for my expenses? I mean he has gone to Palampur. Here's a letter. - From a girl? - All you can think of are girls. Uncle is ill. - He's ill. Now what? I'll have to go. Make arrangements for my journey. Come on. - He has still not come. - I've written to him. - Uncle. Uncle. - He is here. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. How are you? How are you? You were ill. But... - You're the reason of my illness. - Me? How is that? - Shamed me all over the city. Shamed you? Who has? You have. - I have. How is that? - What nonsense. - Shut up. Sir, don't get angry. Let me handle this. Look, Sunil. You're an adult now. - Yes. And quite sensible too. - Yes. - You shouldn't do such things. - As in what? You're doing things. You wasted my time by sending me a fake letter. I have sent the letter because I've fixed the marriage. You fixed the marriage? You fixed the marriage? Congrats. Congrats. This is great news. - I'll get an aunt. - Shut up. You idiot. No. No. Let me explain. Sunil, sir has fixed your marriage with doctor... - I mean doctor's sister. - That's not possible. I don't want to be a patient by marrying a doctor or compounder's sister. You have no choice. Got it? - I have the choice of leaving. - Where are you going? Help. - What are you doing? Leave me. Get him. - Get him. Take him. - Not him. Him. - What are you doing? - Go and lock him up. - What are you doing? - I'll see how he doesn't marry. This is not good. Hey... Leave me I say. Oh God! What are you doing? Why are you hell bent on dishonoring me? - We can't help it. - It's sir's order. Door closed. You laugh. You uncouth girl. Get this straight. Listen careful, we have no connection. I performed all the rituals of the wedding wrongly. This is not marriage. It's eyewash by uncle. Got it? Cry. Cry some more. Cry a lot. You think your tears are going to melt me. I'll appease you. Never. Cry. Cry all you want. Now these tears are your life companion. Enough. Stop crying. I'm dying of thirst. Quench my thirst. Your life might be become worthwhile. Hurry up. This is nowhere enough. Get some more. Get some more. She's gone. Let's go. The coast is clear. Run. Here. What the heck? I'm drinking glass after glass of water. But I'm still thirsty. A glass more. Quick. Hurry up. What are you looking at? Pull him. Pull him up. I'll shoot him. Pull. Darn it. I will shoot that rascal. Don't do that for God's sake. My daughter's life will be ruined. It was ruined the minute this poor girl was married to that rascal. I told you to million times not to be reckless. But looked at the boy's family. Mr. Shekhar is the root cause of this problem. - But what's going to happen now? - Ask Mr. Shekhar. The marriage is done. What's the point in worrying now? - What's the point? - This is the madness of youth. Everything's going to be alright once he comes to his senses. That boy is never going to change. Look, I got them married. Now leave it to me to bring him to his senses. Go and rest. Let me think. Think long and hard. But it's not going to be of any use. Dear, I sympathize with you totally. But I can't help matters. Don't cry. Forgive me if possible. Who is it? Open the door. Who is this woman early morning? Open the door. - Hold on. Go. Go out. Don't barge in like that. Oh God! I get to see beggars early morning. Go. Go out. She's pushing me. Where are you going? Hello. Go out. She's not budging. Come on. Go out. Where do I go? - Oh God! What's this new fashion for? Uncle wanted me to go through the grind of married life by tricking me. I didn't even see the bride's face. I tricked everyone and came here. - So how was that? - Disgusting. That's so bad. This is how you've repaid uncle's love and affection? Never love and affection. Make some food for me. I haven't eaten since last night. I'm starving. Hurry up. Go. Come on. - Bihari. Uncle. - Bihari. Bihari. Has that rascal come here? But where on earth can he go? Who are you? - I'm your niece. - You? Bihari, get my gun. - Gun? Yes. - You've shamed me in public. - Shamed? Yes. - What nonsense. Someone has misled you completely. - Misled me? - You still have shame in you. Really?- Really. - Do you want mirror? - No. Let me deal with you first. You ran away leaving your newly wedding wife. If even I get hanged for it, I'm going to kill you. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Bihari uncle, what have you done? You've killed uncle. - I'm alive. - You are alive. - Here's your food. And here's your gun. Here. Eat, uncle. You eat. Give me the gun. And get ready to die. Eat to your heart's content. Hold on, uncle. Hold on. Here. If I have to die, I'll die like a man. - Not as a woman. - Okay. But you'll have to die. I will die. For sure. - Get ready. Hey... - It's me, Bihari. Bihari. He ran away? - Yes. But he can't escape from me. - Hold on. Hold on. - Okay. Little down. Rekha, the treatment of the patients should be such that our hospital shines. - And our mission is also complete. - Of course. Understood, would be doctor? Look, she is teasing me. If she teases me again, I'll quit from this job. Here's your... - Excuse me. Excuse me, doctor. Doctor again? What's going on? - I'm sorry. - Let's go, Rekha. - Wait. Lady first. Come. Eat. Eat, my dear. Have the banana. Very good. - Very good, my uncle. Enjoy. My uncle. You seem to be in high spirits today. Uncle, now I can have all the fun I want. Uncle's gone. I can relax for a couple of months now. Of course he had to go. He is not useless and good for nothing like you. Uncle, ready a nice suit for me. - Why? I have to go to college. You've been going to college for years. But what have you done? You fail every year. I'm intelligent, that's why.. I'm intelligent. That is why I keep on failing. I keep on failing. If I was stupid I would've passed. I've heard something so incorrect for the first time. It's correct. Not incorrect. Let me reveal the secret. Sit. Just as seasons change. Calenders change. Similarly the college mates also change. And they're replaced by new ones. Beautiful faces replace them. Beautiful faces. Understood? Got it? - Understood. - Have you? So now give me the clothes. So that I can go to college. And if possible also give me some appreciation. Very good. Only you're going to make your family proud. 26. - Yes, sir. 27. - Yes, sir. 28. - Yes, sir. 29.29.29. Strange girl. It's her first day here at the art school. And she has still not come. A single girl's absence shouldn't make much of a difference. Silence. 30. - Yes, sir. 31. - Yes, sir. You'll get blown away the moment you see her. We'll see. - I'm sorry, sir. I'm a little late. - That's alright. - Take care in the future. - Where's my seat? Thank you. Today I'm going to explain to you something about art. What is art? You must have heard that life is short. But art is long. Art is silent music. It is a fine way of conveying one's inner feelings. Take any sort of art. Say music, painting, drama or writing. Are you beautiful. Are you trouble or a damsel? I'm a waiting for you. Idiot. - Thank you. Thank you. - You see. She called me an idiot. - And you're happy? Of course. These modern girls fall for idiots more. I'm sorry. I don't think she's going to entertain you. If she doesn't. I will entertain her. Okay. We shall see. - Sure. Sunil is saying something about you. Greetings. - Idiot. "It's my habit. It's my habit to salute everyone." "Of conversing with pretty people with a smile."

Doctor, can't help it. I need treatment at any cost. You're going to treat me? You're compelling me. How do I say it? There is no other option. I swear. Do this, doctor. Wear the cap. - I should? Yes. - You love wearing it. Don't you? I won't. Don't beat me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm the doctor. My grandfather is a doctor. My father's doctor. Now you've come on the right track. - Yes. It is right said that a kick up the back side.. Does the trick than a pat on the back. Here. One bottle for you. And one bottle for you. Both of you will be silent for good instantly if you have a pill. Now stop harassing me. Leave me alone. Doctor, you didn't understand my meeting. - You made a mistake again. - What mistake have I made now? Not a mistake. I'm not the patient. Or my son. - Actually my daughter is ill. - What happened? Her mouth has closed. She is unable to talk. She has gone dumb. - Yes. Dumb. What's her age? Around 19 or 20. - 19 or 20? Come. Doctor, wait. How can you go just like that? Where's your instrument? This. And that. Moonlight. Take it. What are you looking at? Come on. Let's go. - The girl is young, isn't she? - She is. Come on. Hurry up, doctor. I'm going. I'm going.

Do you want to send me to jail? Moonlight. - Sorry, sir. You're insulting me. I'll check. - Please. Hold on. I'll check. - Sit. Sit. Yes. Yes. - Examine her. She is in great deal of pain. What's wrong with you, Jyoti? What are you saying? Didn't I tell you at the hospital that my daughter has gone dumb? Yes. - Oh, I see. I'll check her. Show me your tongue. - Got scared by the tongue? - No. This seems serious. Okay. You guys go out. I'll treat this patient in private. What did you say? - I'll treat this patient in private. Moonlight, the doctor wants us to go out. - He's a good doctor. He's right. Is it? - Yes. Doctor, treat her. She's my only daughter. I swear. I'll die if anything happens to her. - Don't worry. I'll treat her in such a way that Jyoti will be with you. And Lakshmi will be with me. Oh God! What kind of a man are you? Doctor, treat her. - Out. Moonlight. - Salute, sir. Let's go. - Go out fast. Yes. Yes. Doctor...- Get out. Jyoti. Jyoti. I feel I'll have to treat Jyoti with something good. Very well. Show me your tongue. Show your tongue. What's the matter? Both of you are together. Are you alright? Bhairoprasad, God has been really kind. I was waiting for you. Who's going to wait for me? Moonlight, don't just stand here. Get coffee for the guest. - Yes. Idiot. He's just standing there watching us. Look, my son. This is the fourth installment I've given. Don't fool me anymore. Send Jyoti for a movie with me just once. My heart beats for her all the time. I understood. Even I would feel the same at times. But don't worry. Everything's going to be alright. Go now. Go. There's someone inside. - What? There's someone inside? - Why don't you understand? I told you so many times. My daughter is not well. The doctor is treating her. Yes. - She spoke. She spoke. The blow went a begging this time. But it won't this time. Oh God! - Speak. Oh God! - Speak. I can talk, doctor. I can talk. Save me. Doctor? You see. This is my USP. People either zip their mouths or they start talking. Go on. - My father... Quiet. Idiot. Your father will listen. My father wants to marry me to an old man. That's it. And you dragged it so much. I was forced to. He already has so many children. - I don't have a single child. - That old man is grumpy. I am also sweet 53 years old. I forgot. I'm 35 years young. You're so nice, doctor. I'm nice. I wish I was a doctor too. - What? Nothing. Nothing. Listen. Do this. Let this drama carry on till I tell you. Okay. What's the name of the grumpy old man? Bhairoprasad. - Bhairoprasad. I shall not call myself Dr. Sundar if I don't teach Bhairoprasad.. - A lesson he never forgets. - Gosh. Your name is Sundar. Very nice. - Really? Oh my. Oh my. Thank you, Sunlight. Thank you.

And please just keep silence. You understand, Sunil. - Yes, sir. Saint, please open your eyes. Look in front. At least hold the pencil properly. Hold it. Hold it. Very good. Art school is one strange place. What's the point in making the sketch of a person who has no color in his life? You're looking at the point. And I'm looking at this fraud saint.. Who has these beautiful ladies looking at him. Do you understand? He's referring to you. One day I'll teach him a lesson he never forgets. - Why delay a good deed? - He's so persistent. All thanks to you. Otherwise I'm useless. Whether you entertain him or not he still keeps talking to you. You won't find such a beast in the whole world even if you go looking for one. Only you know where you're the beauty and he's the beast. Wow. - Get lost. Shameless fellow. Sir is here. Time is up. Saint, now you may go.

The fun begins now. What's wrong with the saint today? He's winking. Dirt must have entered his eyes. Hello, sir. Here you are. - Hello. Here are your bulls. What's the matter? Today you've turned the saint into a model. Wow. Superb. You're the one I've been looking for. You have been looking for me. Actually I'm making the statue of Shakuntala. Excuse me. Will you please stand up? Wow. I can never get a better model for Shakuntala than this. I will be Shakuntala. - Absolutely. There can be no better Shakuntala than you. Saint, I'm talking to her. Why are you going? Child, when there is injustice all around in this world.. Meows come out of my heart. - Okay, sir. I'll take your leave. - Thank you very much. This is my card. Do come to the studio tomorrow. - Yes. No. It's not working. A little to this side. That's it. Look there. No. Stand up. Just a minute. Now that's more like it. Just look here. Assume that you're Shakuntala. Think you're Shakuntala. And assume that Khushwant loves you. And he is saying to you that I'm yours. I'll take you far away from this world. Become mine. Don't be sad, my love. I'll make you mine very soon. Lay off. Lay off, you lustful man. Why are you harassing my delicate Shakuntala? Who are you? - Who am I? Who am I? - Who? Look at me through your mind. I'm Shakuntal's love... Oh. So it's you? - Yes. Why did you have to put on this farce? To save my dear Shakuntala from beasts like you. Don't worry about me. Save yourself. - Insult. Bad insult. Look, I'm busy with work. You're disturbing me. Go away. Else I'll have to call someone to throw you out. Impossible - Possible. Bhima. Raghu. Be it Bhima or Vasco Da Gamma. I'm not going to budge. I'll not leave without my Shakuntala. - I'll not come with you. - What did you say? - I'll not come with you. - You'll not come? No. No. - Okay. Then I'll go away. But before I go, I'll take this pot with me. - So that this pot drama ends. - Take your mustache. Stick it on your face. 3. 4. 5. Would be doctor, are you learning maths? No. I'm keeping account. What do you mean? - Hold on a minute. You'll come to know. There. He's back. - That's Sunil. That he is. He starts going up and down as soon as the clock strikes 5.30. This is what he has been doing for quite a few days now. Seems like he has lost something. What do you mean? - I mean this gentleman has lost something precious. What precious thing? Heart. Whose? - His. Of course. There. He's back. Number 7. He goes up and down a hundred times every day. I know. He's following me like my shadow. - And you don't even talk to him. - Why should I? If he wants to be on guard duty without salary then good luck to him. Off I go. Love is very cruel. He's done for. He's back. 12. The heart's forgotten. The heart's forgotten. The heart's forgotten. In your world... 100 rupee note. Who are you? - I'm Sunil. Where are you from? - From here. But your clothes resemble those who live in Himachal Pradesh. Are you ill? - Spot on. I'm a patient of love. I want medication. - But I treat girls. Young girls at that. You're a player. That's why I have to you. - But I... Take it. Take it. - Great. Strange. Someone else will do the treatment. And I get the fees. Very well. Make yourself comfortable here. - I'll send the doctor right away. - Very good. Wait. - Very good. That's more like it. Listen. Give the fees to me only. Not to sir. He'll treat you. I'll brief him. - Absolutely. Look. Do you more like these? - Should I take that back? - No. This is good enough. - Don't go. I'll make arrangements. - Very good. May I come in, madam? Come, would be doctor. Here. - What's this? Bribe. - Bribe? These days nothing happens without bribe. Be it buying a house or marriage. Even if you want to fall in love with someone. And this is the bribe for love. Take it. Or I'll get defamed. Why should I take it? Should I keep it? No. No. Sunil has paid this bribe. Understand why he has. Sunil has paid a bribe. To me. Why? Not to you. To me. It means he... Keep it. - Why is he bribing me? You don't understand. There is a slight difference between your understanding and my meaning. You keep your understanding and meaning to yourself. And spare me. Got it? Yes. Absolutely. So go explain someone with your understanding. Understand? Understood. Bribe. Meaning. Understand and pardon. All my sins have been washed away. Bye, madam. - Bye. The patient became critical... What's your problem? - That's why I'm asking you. Do you have a problem? - What do you mean? - You're a strange man. You didn't recognise me. Actually my uncle Mr. Rai had told me to take care of the new tenants. So are you Mr. Rai's nephew Mr. Sunil. - Yes. I heard your name long ago. But I'm seeing you today. Thank you.

Let me look carefully. - See. I don't see anything special. But your eyes tell a different story. Did you lock with someone? That happened long ago. But today two hearts have become one. Locked eyes with someone. Two hearts have become one. What mathematics is this? Mathematics of love. Of geography. And the history of two hearts. - Just listen. Did you hear anything? - Nothing at all. Then you'll never be able to become a doctor. You don't even understand heartbeat. Madam, when your eyes convey your emotions.. Then what's the point in listening to the heartbeat? I've understood that madam is in love. - My foot. Don't worry about the foot. I'm afraid you might go crazy. I've heard that even the best go crazy in love. I'm giving advice as a doctor. Take it or leave it. Your wish. Bye. - Bye-bye. What news have you got? - We did... Exactly as you said, boss. But... - But what? Never mind what happened this time. Henceforth don't try to hide your cowardice by making excuses. Otherwise I'll thrash you. You may go. Yes. Samsung speaking. Tell me. Everything happened as per the plan, right? Yes. The planned has worked beautifully. Barring today. I get news of my defeat while a smart man like you is around.. That's really shameful. I'm sorry for this time. Such a mistake will not be repeated, boss. Yes. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Can I come in? - What's wrong with you today? - Neena, you? I thought it's him. - Him who? The naughty chap. Of course. Don't talk in riddles. Tell clearly. Him who? You're so dumb. Don't you understand a hint? Okay. But you understand hints very well, right? That's why you're torturing Sunil. Silly. This is about him. - I see. Why? The war is over. - Yes. Now there is peace. So that fine young man has finally won you over. Get out of here. Naughty girl.

Slowly start smiling from today. They'll think that you're slowly getting better. So how can I coming here stop? Smile. Smile. I liked it. - What if Bhairoprasad comes? - Him again? If he comes, stare at him like that and bare your teeth at him. Show. No entry. - Cruel man. How long are you going to make me suffer by making excuses? Let me have some fun for once. You saw the move have some fun. Do you know Nimmi? I know Jyotilakshmi only. Doctor. Doctor, how much longer will I have to work? Bhairoprasad, it's a really horrific disease.

I look good, don't you? It's okay. He'll tell. And don't tell anyone. Or people will think that Mamta is really in love. It's a secret. Let it remain a secret. Bye. Are you writing love letter? Of course. Why would someone whose lover doesn't shut up about her write love letters? Did Sunil meet you? Did Sunil meet? - Of course. He was waiting for me with bated breath. And he came to live as soon as he saw me. Amazing. - Who? You. Of course. Okay darling, what happened after that? We chatted a lot. About love. About complaints. But he had to accept defeat. Very good. What happened after that? Then? Then we had coffee at Gazebo. You had coffee as well. Excellent. Then? Then? Do you have any doubt? We had coffee as well as saw a movie. - Movie? A movie is 2 to 3 hours long. How come you returned so soon? Actually that movie was so disgusting.. So disgusting that we left it halfway. Oh. I guess Sunil met with an accident after the movie. - Accident? It's okay. There's no need to panic. It's a minor injury. I've dressed it. But only you can heal his bleeding heart. - Where is he? - Downstairs. Where are you off to? Sunil needs rest very badly. I have given him a sleeping pill. Got it? Yes. You didn't tell me. How was the movie? Romantic. Comedy. Tragedy. - My foot. Come. Let's go see him. Come on. Please. Please. Brother is a very good person. Just muster some courage and tell him. - I should tell him? What? - Will I have to tell even that? - Really. You're such a coward. - Coward. Look, Mamta. Actually I'm not scared of talking to your brother. I'm scared of uncle only. Yes. Your brother might even consent. But uncle... - Will not consent. So why did you fake to love me? Fake to love you? I never did that. Listen to me. Listen to me. Actually... - What is it? Actually there is something. But there's something. But there's something I've been trying to tell you since long. Now say it. What is it? Should I? Should I? - Yes. Mamta, you wanted to come home, isn't it? - Yes. Alright then. Come home tomorrow. Decision will be made there. The decision will be made, right? Yes. Absolutely. No one can come in between our love. No one at all. - Really? Then it will be you, me. We'll have a small house. Yes. - You will go to the art school every day. - You'll become a very big artist. - Art school? Studies. Restrictions again. So won't you become an artist? Then I don't think our marriage will happen. I will. For sure. You're already started bossing me. Now you'll boss me. I'll worship my God. - I'll deck you up. - But I don't know to do my hair. We'll do this. We'll hire a hair dresser. She'll solve our hair problems. Okay. I'll go now. You're coming to my house tomorrow, right? Not your house. To my house. Yes. Your house. Your house. Your house. Hello, Dr. Prakash. No. Not like that. Since I've to make him my brother-in-law.. I'll have to butter him up slightly. Hello, Dr. Prakash. Are you very busy? Please look at me. What is it? I'll have a heart attack if you shout at me. The matter is nothing. It's the matter of love. Listen to it with love. Oh. So you are Sunil. Did you come running? What's the matter? Actually if I don't tell you I'll sweat. And if I tell you I'm afraid you might start to sweat. That's why you have chilled water first. Chilled water. So now tell me. What is it? I guess you should have another glass of water. Because upon hearing what I say you'll need a couple of glasses of water more. Here. Here. Chilled water. Thanks you know. I needed a glass of chilled water very badly. Okay, tell me. Does a person live longer or shorter after marriage? I can tell you that only after marrying. - Then marry immediately. Doctor. - Yes. Get married. I should get married. To anyone. To Mamta? - To Mamta Dutt. She is willing. So am I. Mamta is willing. You're willing. So who am I to stop you? Mamta. Mamta. - Sunil, come to your senses. - I have. I have come to my senses. - Mamta. My Mamta. - What will people say if they see? I don't care. Your brother has given me the thumbs up. You're mine. You're mine. You're mine. - You're very happy. - Very happy. - What did brother say? - Ask what I said. What? - I said. Dr. Prakash, I want to marry Mamta. You said so. - Exactly. Brother must have kicked you out. Then you must have cried. Or begged him. What happened? The surprising thing is that nothing happened. No drama. I said. Dr. Prakash, I want to marry Mamta. He said. Is Mamta willing? I said. Mamta is willing. So am I. To that he said. Then who am I to stop you? Really? - Really. I'm waiting for someone. Great. Deck up with the entire house with flowers. Like a bride. My beloved is coming. What do you mean? Beloved? Who? You spoil the fun. She's coming. With a veil over her head. Shy. Dressed up like a bride. - She came long ago. - She has? But where is she? Mamta. Mamta, you're here dressed as a bride. I'm so lucky. Better late than never. Now I'll be able to live in Palampur with my head held high. - I was dying to see this day. - But who are you? Me? I'm your father-in-law. Her father. Father-in-law. Father-in-law, go away for God's sake. - But I haven't come here to go. - Uncle, come here. How could you let them in the house? She is this family's daughter-in-law. She is the lady of the house. How can I stop them? Father-in-law, have mercy. I'll be ruined. I'll be ruined. We were ruined the day you ran away from the room of your first wedding night. We can talk it out. Have mercy on me. I beg you. Understand my feelings. - Go from here. - I'll go meet the artist Shekhar. But my daughter will stay here. I'm doomed. She must be on the way. Now what do I do? What do I do? Bihari, don't just stand there. She must be tired. - Arrange some snacks for her. - Oh Lord. You're so kind. That takes care of him. Now her. Listen. How was the drama? Actually I played out this drama.. To drive these old timers away. Come with me. Let's go to that room. Sit and chat. Get up. Come. Come on. Very good. Don't be shy. Come with me. Very good. Two lovers will have a really good time. Thank God. Drove him away. - Who? I mean where uncle is. - Uncle? Uncle will come after two days. But why are you so nervous? I am not nervous. I was waiting for you. Really? - Listen. Let's go outdoors and talk. Are you alright? I've come to your house for the first time. No welcome or reception. What is this? You didn't get me. I meant let's go out and talk at leisure. We'll sit outside and talk about love. Is this why you called me here? Come on. Your house is lovely. I feel like checking it out thoroughly. Some other time. - Some other time? I have come to see. I won't go without seeing it. What's in that room? Nothing. There's a room in the room. You're definitely hiding something from me. No. - I'll check it out at any cost. Listen. Mamta. I see. So this is why. Rascal. You cheat. Is this why you were taking me out? Who's the girl inside? - Girl? Yes. Come and see. - Listen. Come. Who is this? What the heck? - What? I'm sorry. God knows what rubbish I spoke in anger. I'm sorry. - Okay. I forgive you. Come with me. Sit. - So much? This is nothing. I couldn't do anything because of the problem. - What problem? - Because uncle hasn't come. Oh. - Here. Have biscuit. Very good. - You too. Would you like some tea? - Yes. Stop. You'll spill it.

So soon?" - "Can't help it. - Listen." "No. I'm going." "Since our hearts have met. Why should we be afraid of anyone?" "It's a really bad thing to make someone yearn." "Control your heart. Be strong." "This separation will last for a few days. Then we'll be one." "That's enough. I wonder when this problem will get solved." "When I become your wife." "Now may I go? Now may I go?" "But why? Now? So soon?" "Now may I go?" "But why? Now? So soon?" "Now may I go? Bye. - See you." "Bye. - See you." "Bye. - See you." Surajmukhi. - Sunlight. Sunlight. I forgot to ask you.

Where are you off to? Brother, actually it's nothing... But I mean... Never mind. Get some coffee for him first. So Mr... - People call me Shekhar. Mr. Shekhar, so you're a sculptor. Yes. I try to fall in love with stones. I want to fall in love with a stone. So that if I'm scared I can either bump into it or die. - Mamta, you're still here. - Brother, I was wondering. Can't Rekha get the coffee? Mamta, today even I wish to have coffee made by you. And with it if you can... - Brother, it's 6. - It's 6? - Yes. It's 6. - It's 6. Sir, it's 6. Tea. Rekha, do something. He must have turned into a statue waiting for me. And here this sculptor has become the roadblock in my way. I can even lay my life for you. Save your life for brother. Just get me out of this problem. That's it? Right away. Actually someone's waiting for Mamta. - Who's waiting? - Let us also. Who's that lucky guy? - No one. Who is it? Nonsense. Don't overact. Get out of here. Run. - Okay. Bye. Bye. Actually we're organizing a dance drama for the youth. And Mamta is busy rehearsing for it. The rehearsal starts at 5. And it's 6 now. - So does Mamta dance? - Yes. She dances really well. Our show is on the tenth. Please do come. Sure. - The show will start at 7pm. It's my good fortune. I'll take your leave. - What? You didn't have the biscuit. Okay. Have tea then. - No. No Mr. Shekhar, I want you to make a sculpture of Rekha too. Because if this hospital is a body then Rekha is its heart. Sculpture of the heart. Great. You want to put the heart into stone. It's okay. I'll even become a sinner for you. Okay. I'll take your leave now. Do come to the studio. - Certainly. Let's have a sitting of yours too. Listen. Don't mind what Mamta said. I'll tell you everything at the right time. I've started to understand her a little. I've already had four sittings with her. - Oh I see. - Okay, doctor. See you. Do come to the studio. - Certainly. Bye. "Oh my Lord, what's happening?" "I'm restless ever since I've fallen in love with him." "Oh my Lord, what's happening?" "I'm restless ever since I've fallen in love with him." "Oh my Lord." "Whenever I go before him I lose control of my heart." "My eyes get cast low." "With my face covered. And quivering lips." "I have lost sense of whether it's night or day." "Ever since I've fallen in love with him." "Oh my Lord, what's happening?" "I'm restless ever since I've fallen in love with him." "I want to express my feelings." "I want to become his." "When I start to talk my heart starts to pound." "I swear. I'm unsteady. This is a weird kind of a high." "Ever since I've fallen in love with him." "Oh my Lord, what's happening?" "I'm restless ever since I've fallen in love with him." "At first, I couldn't behold him enough." "But then I lost my heart to him." "He gives me goosebumps whenever he touches me." "And then I found him wherever I looked." "Ever since I've fallen in love with him." "Oh my Lord, what's happening?| "I'm restless ever since I've fallen in love with him." "Oh my Lord." I expect loyalty from her who doesn't know what loyalty is. My, my. Simple in style. Shame in her eyes. Innocent face. I wonder why people still consider her a killer. - So you're here. - Not willingly. I had to come. I know that you've managed to fool Mamta. And you'll even marry her sooner or later. - Don't forget to attend our wedding. - How can I forget? I attended your first wedding too. Oh. The pretense of wedding. You still remember. Amazing. I see. So it was pretense. What if I tell this to Mamta? - Please that's not funny, uncle. - Uncle? Don't you dare call me uncle. Have I grown that old? - Old and you. Never. You're still very young. Thank you. What would you know how much I yearn for Mamta? Mr. Shekhar. - Come, Rekha. - Hello. - Hello. You just forgot that I have to go home. I've been waiting for you since so long. Oh. I'm so sorry. Do this. I'm a little busy. Go with Sunil. - Sunil, don't mind. - It's okay. Come. Thank you. Did you hear our conversation? By the way, I don't believe my ears. I believe my eyes. That's good. Rekha, Shekhar is mad. - Why? He talks rubbish all the time. Rekha, don't tell Mamta what Shekhar said. What did he say? Of course. Come. - Okay. I don't believe my ears. I believe my eyes. - What do you mean? I didn't get you. - I saw everything. What on earth did you see that has got you fuming? Both of you coming home shamelessly. What nonsense. - Before rebuking me look your misdeeds. - And shame on you. - How dare you. So won't listen? I'll show you. Don't you dare touch me. You'll see the worst in me. - What are you doing? - Get out of the way. Move. - Stop. Stop. For you. And this is for you. Start. What the hell is going on here? She created this drama to hide her misdeeds. You see. Your tongue has such a sharp tongue. So what if Mamta says something? She is still naive. You keep quiet. She is naive. I know you'll side for your sister only. But I'm no one's slave to tolerate people's rebuke. Arrange some other place for me to live. I'll not live here. Why would you go from here? You rule in this house. I'll go away. Rekha. - Rekha. I'm sorry. I didn't know that my joke would create this situation. No. I have nothing against you. This had to happen one day. Now I can't live here even for a second. - Where are you going? Wherever I fate takes me. I'm fed up of this life. Don't act so immature. Come with me. - No. Let me go. - Listen to me. Come with me. Such things happen. Don't worry. Sit. I'll just be back. Here. Excuse me. Hello. Yes. It's me Sunil. Yes, doctor? - Has Rekha come there? - Rekha? No. No. No. You've some misunderstanding. - Then where is she now? - How would I know? Yes. Yes. Okay. Yes. "This life seems like a punishment for a long forgotten sin." "This life seems like..." "The cries are lifeless just like the mellowed breath" "The storm is picking up. And the winds are strong." "The lamp is burning." "This life seems like a punishment for a long forgotten sin." "This life seems like..." "Living in these times is difficult in any way." "A man's plight is for the sake of a man." "I wish for my death." "This life seems like a punishment for a long forgotten sin." "This life seems like a punishment for a long forgotten sin." "This life seems like..." Rekha. Poison. Rekha. Rekha. What happened? Sunil. - Yes? I... am leaving this world. - But why? Rekha. Rekha. She is dead. Oh God! What have I gotten myself into? Oh God! I'm afraid uncle will... Police. Oh my God! Before that let me take her away from here. Otherwise... Stay here. Careful. Careful. Where are you off to? Mr. Sharma, this is Sunil. Inspector Sharma. Met you at the right time. - He wants to sneak away. - Don't worry. Sit him in the office. I'll inspect the studio in the meanwhile. Sure. Sure. Come. Mr. Shekhar, I had heard a lot about your art. But today I've come to know. That sculpture in particular. - Which one? - The one you made recently. Yes. - Where did that chap go? I had told you that he's eager to sneak away. You went there and he sneaked away. Have a smoke. - Thanks. Hello. Police station. Yes. The nephew of Mr. Rai Sunil has been missing from the house for two days now. If you could find him. Yes. Okay. Okay. - Darling. I'm coming. - Fresh trouble. Fresh trouble. Darling, you've come back so early. - Yes. Have you brought all my things? - Yes. My make-up. My gown. - Yes. And my sandals. - Yes. Hey... What have you done with your hair? Had your hair set? Yes. - Where? - At Africa Habakuba. - Oh. Don't be naughty now. You're always joking. Do you still love me? - Yes. How much? - Very much. You know I love you. - Yes. I know. - What's wrong with your voice? Don't be naughty now. Snake. Who are you? - Who are you? Help. Help. Police. Police. So you're hiding here? Get him. Come on. Help. Help. Mr. Rai, why are you worrying so much? Sunil has been caught. He'll be here any minute. Leave me. I said leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Snake. - Snake. What nonsense. - It's fake. You thought you can give the police a slip. We search even jungles in search of criminals. Let alone the city. But officer, who is this African magician? Didn't you recognise him? This is Sunil. - What Sunil? I'm Sunil. I'm innocent. Believe me. I haven't done anything. Lay off. You haven't done anything? He doesn't live peacefully nor does he let me live peacefully. Pull his ears. - Yes. Yes, uncle. Back up. You found this moron so fast. Amazing. We don't leave any stone unturned in order to fulfill our duty. But people think we're useless. I'll shoot such people. Why are you crying? You see, inspector. What he has made of himself in just two days? I feel I'll die before my time due to his mischief. Rascal. But you are the witness. If I die first.. Then I will.. Like nephew like uncle. May I come in? - Come in. You? How was that? You thought a beautiful girl has come for treatment. You replied so quickly. Come in. I have come in. Sit. I want to discuss something important. My case is also very serious. Very serious. This disease is incurable. It's answer from life. Do something before it gets too late. Stop fooling around. - Do you see this letter? - Is it my wedding invite? Who all are you inviting? Rekha's aunt has sent his letter. Rekha is not there. You went missing since the day Rekha went missing. Prakash. I didn't get you. Me and Rekha. I know nothing. Sunil, I know everything. Stop meeting Mamta till Rekha is found. - Now this marriage cannot happen. - Prakash, listen to me. Prakash. It's nothing. But still it's something. The same thing. It's nothing then... - Mamta. Mamta. - Why have you come here? - To meet you. - Didn't brother tell you? His decision is my decision. Mamta. - Nothing doing. Aren't you married? Oh. Now I understand the problem. I'll fix Shekhar real good. Right. At the place where you have disposed Rekha. - What are you saying? - This is true. I don't want to see your face. Go away. - Mamta. "This life seems like a punishment for a long forgotten sin." "This life seems like a punishment for a long forgotten sin." "This life seems like..." "Till yesterday, I had my love in my arms." "But today I'm all lonely." "My heart is saying this." "This life seems like a punishment for a long forgotten sin." "This life seems like..." "Every dream of a wishful heart is unfulfilled." "Whom do I ask the path to my lost destination?" "Who knows?" "This life seems like a punishment for a long forgotten sin." "This life seems like..." Rekha. - What nonsense. There he is. Please leave, uncle. You've been dusting since long now. You've dusted enough. Go. - Go now. No way. I can't do this. What's there to be so afraid? - Of course. It could cause my death. Gosh! Why are you guys talking about death? Idiot. - I step out of the house. And if I bump into Sunlight or Moonlight I'll be finished. Don't worry. I'll be with you. I mean behind you. Please get that information. - No. For my sake. - Never. - For your sake. - Never. Never. Never. - For Jyotilakshmi's sake. - Jyoti's sake. What have you said? That's it. Now I'll smash the biggest mountains. Jyoti. Jyoti, if I return alive then give me a tight hug. And if I die, pay your tributes to me. - Your wish will be met. - Where are you sending my Lord? He's so sad. - Jyoti. My friend, take care of my Jyoti. Don't worry. I'll take good care of your Jyoti Lakshmi. Stop. Back up. Don't take care from so close. Take care from a distance. At least walk a few steps with this sacrificial lamb. Sure. Where is he? I'll break his legs. See. Didn't I tell you? Run. Run. Run. Mamta. I have such wretched luck. Mamta hates me now. There are other ways of falling in love. Some other girl if not Mamta. There is no dearth of girls. - Enough. - Yes, lover boy. - This is the matter of the heart. - Replacements don't work here. - This has become more complicated. Listen. That fool Shekhar has created this problem. You're right. If he had come in between Mamta wouldn't have turned her back on me. There is only one way of getting rid of Shekhar. What is that? Tell me. Quick. Finish him. - You mean. Spot on. - I can never do that. - Wait. Or break his hands and legs. - You mean hooliganism. - I can never do that either. - Wait. You can do one more thing. Either forget Mamta or commit suicide. Impossible. Impossible. This is impossible. That is impossible. What is possible then? What do you want? Possible. Impossible. Impossible. Impossible. Possible. Possible. Cigarette. - For cigarette. So do you want the change? - We'll see about that later. - Oh. Thank you. Thank you. - But first think of an idea. - Idea? Wait. You drink this cheap cigarette? I gave you money for proper cigarette. You don't know what this cheap cigarette can do. Watch. My brain has started to tick. Got any idea? - Got it. Got it. Got the idea to get rid of Shekhar. Got it. Then tell me what that idea is. - I will. But we need to be careful. I'll whisper it in your ears. Please. But how is this going to help? It surely will help. Shekhar will be exposed. He'll be broke. And these modern day girls don't fall in love with paupers. Since you've shown me the way. Please show me how it's done. - What do you mean? - Go to Shekhar's studio.. And check if there's anyone there. Lover boy, you always make the sacrificial lamb. I'll be done for if I bump into Sunlight and Moonlight. I have a remedy to it as well. - Give this to them. - Why them? I'll keep it. Oh Lord. One last move is what's left. The victory will be ours. Sunil will be blown away when he comes to know of our idea. By the way, he's not in his senses even now. Hello. Samsung speaking. Sammy, I feel my scheme and your blow both are going wasted. I'm not a rookie. Assume that now there's nothing blocking our way. Sammy, assume that whatever you're doing is not just for me. It's for Mamta as well. I know. I know very well. Lover boy. - Compounder. What information have you got? There is no one at the studio. Both Mamta and Shekhar have gone for a movie. Gone for a movie? No problem. We'll clean up the mess before they come. Let's go. - Come on. Where are you planning to go? For a movie. Don't stop us now. It's half. Half. Run. Run. Run. May I know why you're troubling me at midnight? I'm sorry for the trouble. The legal procedure has compelled us to trouble you like this. Legal action against me? - No. We've come to arrest your nephew Sunil. Arrest Sunil? What has he done? He has set Shekhar's studio ablaze. And run away. What? Mr. Shekhar's studio? Oh God! He's my dear friend. Yes. I know. It's a really serious matter. With great regret I also wish to inform you that Mr. Shekhar.. And Mamta who were in the studio at that time couldn't save themselves. - Couldn't save themselves? - Yes. Because fire had engulfed the place. There was no way out. There was no way out. But Sunil can never do that. Even I wouldn't have believed. But concrete evidences.. Has compelled me to arrest him. Concrete evidence. Yes. His car is still parked near the studio. He left it there in panic. And his clothes and shoes were also recovered from that car. - But why on earth did he do that? - Only he can answer that. Now allow me to arrest him. Arrest him immediately. And produce that thug before me. He has reduced me to a joke. Uncle. Are you alright? So both of you are hiding here? Bihari, give me my gun. Shoot me. But I would definitely say this before I die. I haven't murdered anyone. So are the police lying? No. The police are right. When I got the information that the studio is empty I set it ablaze. Why did you set it ablaze? Why did you go silent? Sir, let me tell you. Listen. He was in love. Love? - Yes. He and Mamta were in the same college. He got besotted by Mamta. And Mamta got besotted by Shekhar. Mamta fell in love with Shekhar. He couldn't tolerate that. And he set the studio on fire. That's it. - Shut up. Your wife is crying over her luck at her native place. And you're in love? Uncle, love just happens. Mamta was my love. She was my life. Without her my world is lonely. As long as I'm in my senses, I'll think only about her. The police are here. Now both of you will get rigorous imprisonment. Bihari, open the door. Let the police come in. - Very well, sir. - Wait, uncle. I'll open the door. Now I'm not afraid of death. It's you. Please come. Hello, sir. - Hello. Police are on guard outside. And you have a gun in your hand. What's the matter? To arrest both these thugs. Yes. You'll get to know in a bit. First tell me. What brings you here so late? What do I say? My unfortunate sister is in really bad state. She was hell bent on committing suicide. I and my wife were forced to bring her to you. She is your daughter-in-law. You decide her fate. Get up. I don't understand. What blessings I should give you? If I could share your sorrow by dying I would've done even that. What are you saying? Your brother-in-law is a murderer. Murderer? - Yes. He set someone's house on fire and burnt two people alive. Burnt them alive? What's going to happen now? He'll get life term or he'll be hanged. He deserves it. Uncle, save my husband. You don't know who you're defending. This rascal is not willing to accept you as his wife even in this situation. Never. I have no connection with this girl. Please agree. - No. I'm compelled. Love happens only once in life. And it has happened. - But your love has been reduced to ashes. Now why are you hell bent on killing me? If your love is also true then you also get ready to die. Don't kill him. Okay then. Both of you get ready. I'm ready as ever. My name will go down in history just like Romeo and Juliet. Mamta. Mamta. Mamta. - Where are you going? You hid my daughter in your house and gave us the directions to the station. You thug. - You're right. What are you waiting for? Stab him. Not here. He's running away. We tried really hard to stop and save him. But Sunil... We've still not been able to find his dead body. No. That's just not possible. - Uncle, did he marry me for this? - Be strong. Get up. Be strong. How cruel You are. You want to sit up there and you with innocent hearts. Stupid. You want to make me cry. I will not cry. I will not cry. I will not cry. Sir, be strong. Come on. Come on. Sunil. Sunil. Sunil. - My Lord. Sunil. - My Lord. Uncle, save me. I haven't committed any crime. I'm innocent. Why are you trying to escape from the police if you're innocent? And isn't it a crime that you married her.. But you're madly in love with someone else? Uncle, love happens only once in life. And my love is Mamta. You fool. Will you shut up about Mamta? Take a look at this beautiful face. Mamta. Mamta. So Sunil, did you like your bride? You? - How was my drama? Drama? What do you mean? - You call this drama, Shekhar? - Rekha, you're alive? Yes. Exchange the garlands or the auspicious time will pass. Don't be shy, my sister-in-law. Here. Hurry up. Here you are. Let's go inside. Let's celebrate with some sweets. - How was that? - Come on. Come on. 'I see. So all of them together fooled me.' - I'm sorry for hitting you. - Okay. I forgive you. Snake.
