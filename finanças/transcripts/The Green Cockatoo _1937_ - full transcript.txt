I think we found your suitcase, miss. Oh, thank you. Could you identify it? You mean what is in it? Yes, miss. Oh, nothing very much. Just a few clothes and a picture. What sort of a picture, miss? A little one of my home near shalford. Yes, yes, I know shalford, but what's in the picture? My father standing at a gate. Would there be elm trees? Yes, there are elm trees. Thank you, miss. You're from shalford? Yes, it's in Devonshire. Yeah, I know. I know it, it's beautiful. Going to London? Yes. Been there before? No. Why are you going? To get work if I can. That's the trouble with the small towns. Oh, but London's a big town. I was thinking of shalford. I don't know what you mean. The small town is the nation's greatest tragedy. Each small town gives up its best and gets nothing in return. There is no economic absorption of the energies of youth. Children are forced to leave their parents and go away into the city, and their lives become a series of occasional visits to the ones they love. I hate cities. You must be careful in London. Because London is full of iniquity, lecherous men, strange women, robbers, thieves, gamblers. But I always thought London would be beautiful. And when he gets here, tell him I got tired waiting. He'll be here in a minute. Ah, wait a minute, boss. He said he'd show up. I think I could live without him. I'm not so sure of him anyway. Late and sorry. But I'm worth waiting for, don't you think? Oh, it's gettin' a bit chilly in here. And I'm a set up for pneumonia. Well, should we close the window or get down to business? We'll get down to business. And you'll have to be very careful, Dave. Yes, have you seen this? Oh, this is frightful. You know, none of us ought to go near that dog race again. It's not that funny, Dave. We're betting a lot of money against huntsman in the fifth. We depend on you to see that he does not win. That's the whole story. Yeah, not quite the whole story, Terrell. The only part you're forgetting is my advance. You're going to see that huntsman does not win? - Right. - How? Well, I don't know. Maybe I'll put a bit of chewing gum under his left front foot, or give him a long drink of water just before the race starts. Of course, it's a pity, too, you know. He's easy the best dog in the race. And here's our part of the bargain. Be sure you keep yours. Fair enough. Huntsman to win. How much? All of it. What are you gonna do? What do you think we're gonna do? # over the dim blue hills # # strays a wild river # # over the dim blue hills # # rests my heart ever # # dearer and brighter # # than jewels and Pearl # # dwells she in beauty there # # maire my girl # # dwells she in beauty there # # maire my girl # # she is too kind and fond # # ever to grieve me # # she wear a heart # # e'er to deceive me # # were I tyrconnell's chief # # or Desmond's Earl # # life would be dark # # without maire my girl # # maire my girl # # my girl # Sing that again, kid. You made me cry. As a matter of fact, I feel like crying all over again. Good. You've got a heart. You've got a soul. You're sentimental. Oh, insulting me, eh? Oh, no, no. I can't watch people cry. Breaks my heart. Here. You hold the piano up for me like a good boy and I'll dance you out of it. What are you doing there? Listen, I can stand anything but a cheap, petty, lost near crook. I don't mind if you Rob a bank. I don't think if I mind if I caught you holding up a train. But there's one thing I won't stand for. What's that, kid? I won't stand for nobody stealing my neckties. Not even my brother. Hiya, Dave. All right. She is a bad one you picked out. Here, try this one. Cool, that's swell. Thanks. Dots and all. Yeah, dot. How long you been here? Long enough to hear you singin' that song. You wouldn't like to sing it again for me, would ya? You're not drunk, are ya? Of course I'm not drunk. I'm too smart for that. All right, you asked for it. Where'd you get it? I took a lot of seconds. Terrell? Half of it's yours. You can have the whole lot if you like, Jim. I don't want half of it. I don't want any of it. And I don't want you to have anymore to do with Terrell and that gang. It's an easier way of making money than singing in a joint like this for a few Bob a week. Yeah, sure, and it's an easy way to get into trouble. You mind me telling you something? Shoot. You're headed for nothing good. Oh, well, maybe you're right. I am right. Yeah? I'd get out of here if I was you, Dave. Just overheard two fellas talking. Said Dave had double crossed the Terrell gang and they was gonna get him. Thanks. Oh, you know I, I just have your interest at heart. Yeah, thanks. Why did you do it? Smart guy, wise guy. I'm not worried about Terrell. And the police? Well, what about 'em? You were mixed up with them. They're next, what about 'em and I don't like 'em. Do you know anybody who does? Listen, kid. If you're gonna wear my ties, you've gotta learn how to tie 'em. You gotta tie things tight, see. You gotta take care of yourself. You gotta get a train tonight. You've gotta get out of London. And you gotta keep in touch, you and me. I can stay at chic's place out in edendale. He's not using it this week. Ah, that's no good. You gotta clear right out. I'm not afraid. I know you're not afraid, but you're taking a train within an hour and you're going away, and you're gonna take care of yourself. And you're gonna let me hear from you tomorrow night at the club. If I don't get word by then, I'll know everything's okay. Now scram. Swell, kid. Chum. Hello? Give me soho 1234. Terrell? Jim Connor here. Listen, I hear you guys have got some ideas about my brother Dave. Well, you better lay off, see? You'll have a lot of trouble on your hands. Who's that? Jim Connor. What's he want? Getting tough about Dave. What do we do with him? Oh, we'll take care of him, as soon as we take care of Dave. We'll have to. Now you're in London. It's a vile and wicked city. But it's lovely. You will be in danger! You're alone! What are you going to do? Well, I don't know. Going to some hotel? I really don't know. What do you advise? I cannot give advice. I am a philosopher. Phone whitehall 1212. Whitehall 1212? That's Scotland yard. They'll take care of you. There's a phone box there. You must not be alone. Good bye! Goodbye. Hi, Dave. Hello, Maddison. Where are you going, Dave? No place. I'm just waitin' for a friend. - Cigarette? - Thanks. Bad luck today. Oh, I am sorry. Yeah, was bad luck for you. Pardon me, miss. Will be using the phone long? Well, I don't know, I'm not quite sure how it works. Well, I'm in a hurry, may I? Don't go, miss. I shan't be a minute. And I'll get your number for you. What is it? Whitehall 1212. Well, that's the yard. What are you calling them for? Well, I was told they'll take care of me. Operator, get me piccadilly 4674. I want a hotel for tonight. Hotel, eh? We let him have it all right, and I think we got him. I'm not sure. Where is he? He went that way. No reply? That's impossible. There must be somebody there. What number are you ringing? Okay, miss. There's no need for you to call the yard. I know a place you can stay right here in the neighborhood. It's reasonable prices, respectable. It's just what you want. Well, I, I don't know. It's all right, miss. You can trust me. It's right up the street here. Here. Just you stick close to me. You sure this isn't too much trouble? No, not at all, miss. Hello, Dave. Hi, Terrell. Hi, boys. See you later. Sure. I want a room. There's only one room left and that's 22 on the second floor. Very good room, sir. The room's for this young lady, not for me. Three and six bed and breakfast. Is that all right? Yes, I'll take it. This way, miss. Goodnight, and thank you. Goodnight. Now I'd like to thank you. Goodnight. Anything else, miss? Do you think I could have a cup of tea? Oh, at this time of night? Well, I'll make it myself if... All right, I'll get you one. Thank you. Operator. Excuse me, miss. Would you do something for me? Of course. Please. Take this message. What message? Please tell me. You're ill. No. I'm all right. I'll sit down. Loosen my tie. Find my brother. Green cockatoo. Tell him Terrell. I don't understand. What's his name? Call him. Green cockatoo. Tell him Terrell. Promise. I promise. Thank you. - You're hurt! - No, I'm through. I'll get a doctor. No, no doctors. Oh, wait. Here. Have away my share. Call him. Green cockatoo. Terr... Miss cowling! Miss cowling! Miss cowling! You didn't have to kill him to get the money, little fool. Now you're in a fine mess. You'll hang for this. I didn't do it, he was ill. I was just trying to help him. The police will have a good laugh over your story. Where's the money you took from him? Maybe a good lawyer can help you. Where's the money? What is it, Lilly? I didn't do it. I met him at the railway station. He brought me to this place. He wanted me to help him. You expect the police to believe that? Yes, everyone must believe it. Everyone. They've gotta believe it. They've gotta believe it! Police! Police! Officer, there's a man been murdered. Where? Right upstairs in the hotel. He's dead, I tell you, dead! The girl, she just ran out. Didn't you see her down the street? She stuck him with a knife. Can't get very far. We'll pick her up before morning. I'll have to come in and have a look at the body. Call the doctor? No, no. Sounds like Dave's finished. That settles him. Yes. But it doesn't settle Jim. Come on. My dear young lady. Do, come in, come, come. Will you give me a lift? Well, the crazies. Ram your fingers in that door. What is that? I say, this is fun! Let's go to maidenhead! No, I want to go, oh, I've forgotten the name! Well, that's funny! So have I! Well, it's a place. The green, the green something. I, the green something. You'll get to maidenhead. No, it's a place in London. The green something. I know, blue dragon! Charlie. Things might get a little hot 'round here tonight. I'll be upstairs. Anybody asks for me, I'm not in, except my brother Dave. I'll get you, Jim. Give me a drink, will you? Righto. There you are. Got to here all right, didn't I? Green cockatoo, everything? Thank you. No, no, no trouble at all, no trouble at all. I'm on my way to Brighton, and if I don't hear from you, when I get there I suppose that I never met you. Thank you. No, charmed. Please, can you tell me where I can find a man named Connor? I could, but I can't, so to speak. Oh, but please, it's important. I have a message for him. He's not in, miss. Not in? I'd try tomorrow, miss. Tomorrow? Thanks. Here's our license, inspector. Everything open and above board. Save that for another time, Charlie. I'm looking for a girl. A girl? Young, small, wearing a white mackintosh. She's wanted for murder. Seen anybody like that about tonight? Well, I can't say I have exactly, inspector. So many girls going in and out of this place all the time, you know? Besides, you know what it is with me. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. Chinese, that is. A sailor taught it to me. Chinese, eh, Charlie? Get out of here! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Well, that's all right, kid. What can I do for you? The police are downstairs. The police? That's nothin' new. They're always bustin' where they're not wanted. All in the cause of law and order. But they're after me! After you? I don't blame them. What do they want you for? I haven't done anything, honest. I don't care whether you have or not. Johnson, better try the upstairs rooms. Yes, sir. The joint's knee deep in coppers. They'll be up here in a minute. Looks like you're stuck, kid. What do they want you for? I'll never get away. Will you help me? Sure. I'll help ya. Don't know why I should at this time of night. Take your clothes off. What? No, no, I mean, take your coat off. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna make you my new partner for a minute. Listen, can you sing or dance or do card tricks or anything? I can recite. No, that's no good. Can't you sing a little? A little. Good. Follow me. Now listen, kid. You're tough, see? You've been singing around these joints for years. Coppers don't bother you more than flies in your beer. If they ask you any questions, just sass 'em back. Say, you got nice eyes, kid. That's a cop. They've all got big hands. Just a minute! Now listen. I'm gonna start singin', see? Every time I stop, you just sing, "smokey Joe." Got it? Just say, "smokey Joe," okay? Come in! Well, well, well, pat. How are ya? Come right in. Glad to see ya. This isn't a social visit, Jim. I'm glad of that. There's not a drink in the house. Who's this girl? This one? She's my new singin' partner. Singing partner, right? Yeah. Like to hear her? She's terrific. You are terrific, aren't you? Yes, I'm terrific. Yeah, listen. # who's got every girl in town # # tryin' the fell down blues # # who's that handsome so and so # # what's his name # # smokey Joe # # who goes sneakin' round at night # # rhythm in his shoes # # everybody wants to know # # say, what's his name # # smokey Joe # # he's here, he's there # # you'll find him everywhere # # that turk won't work # # he likes to take it easy 'cause he ain't got a care # # now who's got gamblin' on the run # # who's got loaded dice # # shoots that cinch every throw # # who's that man # # smokey Joe # That's American style she sings. Sort of different, isn't it? - Yeah. - Mmm. Thought you'd appreciate it. How long have you been in this part, miss? Oh, just... - just a couple of weeks. Picks it up fast, doesn't she? We're lookin' for a girl around here. Small, baby face, wearing a white mackintosh. Seen anyone like that? Nope. Wouldn't look twice if I had. Well, keep your eyes out, will ya? By the way, Jim. You better run down and see the inspector. There's something he wants to talk to you about. What is it? He'll tell ya. Fooled him, all right. Every time a copper comes in here, I wanna open all the windows. He's plenty dumb. He'd of thrown you in jail for singing like that. Wasn't I terrific? You were terrific. I'm sorry. Ah, stop it. What you need is a cup of coffee. And I need some fresh air. I'll take care of you. But no more singing. What's he doin' with that dame? Come on. Somebody's following us. Let's cut through the arches. Can you hear anything? Quiet! Come out of there, you. I know where you are. You stay here. I'll see if they've gone. That's how they got out. He's probably on the embankment by now. Come on. They've gone. We'll give 'em time to clear. Kind of fun, isn't it? It's no fun for me. Just like playing hide and seek. Didn't you ever play it when you were a kid? Not this way. Who were those men? Just a couple of bad boys. Why are they after me? They're not. They're after me. You? Yeah. They don't like the way I comb my hair. Come on, let's get outta here. Jake's got his lie around the corner by the embankment. Yeah, sure. You're a swell dame, you are. Why, fell for you the moment I saw you. You know, every time I look at you, I just think of playing bands, bedroom suites. Where have you been? I saw that man with a knife and I thought you were dead. Hah, you gotta follow me, kid. What's the use of coming back if I was dead? Come on, don't stand there jabberin'. We gotta get going. What made you come back? Well, I had to find ya. Don't ask so many questions. That's the best coffee on the market. You can't touch it at the price. Who wants to at any price? Two coffees, please. Hello, Jim. Okay, Jake, we gotta go. Yeah, as soon as I get Lyle started. He's in one of his moods again. Well, snap him out of it. I'm in a hurry. Feel better, kid? Come on. Well, I'll tell you what I think of your blinking coffee when I come back. Come on, ready to go. Take a seat, kid. There's no extra charge. Now what's this all about? What have you been doing, anyway? Shall I start at the beginning? As good a place as any other. I came to London tonight from shalford. Shalford? What's that? It's a town. Oh, I get it. Shalford's one of them little towns that the little girl came from to make her way in the big city. Right? Yes. And you left your mother and father. Just my father. And all the pretty trees. Yes. Elm trees. I know, and there are roses around the door, and now you're lonesome for the green fields, the trees and the cows. I know that story by heart. And I don't believe it. Look, why don't you tell me the truth? I'm trying to help you. But it is the truth. I came to London tonight on the midnight train. In an hour, lady, you were rushing into a joint in soho with a flock of cops at your heels. Nice going, kid. Well, I had a reason. I had to deliver a message. I don't blame you for not being on the level. You don't know who I am. Anyway, whatever you've done, it's your own business. I haven't done anything. Then there's nothing to worry about. Unless you start singing again. Why did you help me tonight? Eh, 'cause I hate cops, I guess. 'Cause you looked so funny. What happened? He's one up at the moment. You didn't get him? No. He nearly got me. We should've clipped him outside that club. Where's Steve? He's over at Riley's, waiting for me. You got your car here? Yup, she's downstairs. What are you gonna do about it? Do you know where he is? At that hangout at edendale. Take dekeen and the girl there. Won't your friend mind us coming here? Ah, he only uses the place once in a blue moon. His Butler will let us in. He knows me. Won't he mind? He might be in bed. Ah, don't believe that bloke ever goes to bed. Wonder why he keeps a Butler in this dump. He's full of swank. Nobody ever stops here except me. Oh, hi, protheroe. Oh, how do you do, sir? Is it all right if we come in? Please do, sir. You're more than welcome. Here you are, kid. The royal suite. Make yourself at home. Thank you. I hope you pardon my appearance, sir. I-I wasn't expecting visitors. Oh, that's all right, protheroe. Governor away? Yes, sir, unfortunately. And has been for a long time. Eh, get a bit fed up with yourself, don't you, prothe, being all alone? I do find it rather tedious, sir, compared with my last situation. Last situation? Yes, sir. Lady Diana was, if I may say so, a bit of a goer, sir. One of them bright young things, eh? Precisely, sir. 64, she was, but quite a stepper, sir. Quite a stepper. I take it you mean she was quite a stepper. Yes, sir. Shall I prepare the double room? Or single, sir? And what time breakfast? We'll go into that later, protheroe. Cut yourself a slice of sleep. Looks as if you need it. Scram. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. If I may say so, sir, I find it quite refreshing to receive orders again. Goodnight, sir. This looks nice and comfortable. Yeah, sure. You'll be all right here. Yeah, it's got class, this joint. Just like a museum. Hey, bet he paid 30 nicker for that furniture. Oriental, isn't it? Look at that picture. See what I mean? It's elegant. Gives the place tone. F.d. Bore. Guess that's the guy who painted it. See the little men in the boat? Look at that water. Looks real, doesn't it? Yeah, I wouldn't want anything cozier if I was married. Um, married properly, I mean. Married, lines and everything. Blimey, look at his library. Seven of 'em. "Up the Amazon with a fishing rod." "Seaweed collecting" by Cannon softly. "Sex life of a newt." Thought if you was a newt you didn't have any. Oh, maybe I'm thinking of a neutral. "Eddie called little by little." "Eddie was not quite himself, or he would not have acted as he had done. His quotations, though not deep, had with the exciting events of the evening made his head giddy, and the stroke of the game, which he had not now felt for two years, roused him to madness." Nice kid. Open your eyes, kid. Yeah, they're blue, all right. Just wanted to make sure. That's my favorite color. You got brown hair, too. That's a swell combination. None of your dizzy blondes for me. Never can trust 'em. You know all about women, don't you? I know enough about 'em to know when I've got something. You're just the right type. Blue eyes, brown hair. About 5'2". Seven stone 10, right? Yes. What's your name, kid? Eileen. I used to know a poem about a girl called Eileen. I'd recite it to you if I knew it. What was that you said about reciting tonight? Yes, I can recite. I wish you had. Go on, let me hear something. All right. Um. "Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace on my breast. Would I were sleep in peace, so sweet to rest." That's Romeo and Juliet. Romeo, eh? I heard of that guy. He was a sucker for a good-looking dame, wasn't he? Yes, I suppose he was. Mmm, I got one for you. "There was a young girl from Bombay, who down by the river did play. One day came a sailor"... Oh, you, you won't want to hear the rest of that, would you, Eileen? I don't remember it so good, anyway. Hey, I'm hungry. What do you say I get old flannel face to rustle up a couple of eggs for us? Yes, that would be nice. What's that? Coppers. What'll I do? You're gonna hide, kid. Now don't make a sound. I'll get rid of these guys. Someone must've tipped them off you were here. All right, protheroe, I'll handle this myself. Your name Jim Connor? Yeah. Who are you? Never mind that. We'd like to talk to you. Okay. Come in. What can I do for you? Scotland yard asked us to look in and see if you were up here. They did, eh? Well, you can call the boys right back and tell 'em I am. They want to see you. They've been looking for you all night. For me? What do they want? Don't you know? Don't tell me. Let me guess. I got it. Three dames jumped in the river last night and left notes blaming me, right? They'll tell you down at the yard. You ready to go? Sure. There's only one hitch. I've got a sort of a date for breakfast out here this morning. Don't worry about that. You'll be able to keep your date if you still want to. I'd hate to keep the little lady waitin'. It's Dave, all right. I'm sorry, Jim. There's some of his effects here. You can have them, of course, if you want them. Dots and everything. Who killed him, inspector? We don't know, Jim. Do you think you can tell us anything to help? Anything about Dave? You know, his friends or what he was doing or? He was just a good kid. That's all. Who killed him, inspector? Think it was a girl, Jim. They're wrong. No, we think she met Dave and she took him up to her room and... - you're wrong. Perhaps not, Jim. She was at the green cockatoo last night. You were there. Did you see anybody who had a baby face, rather pretty, young, just over five foot tall, between seven and eight stone, brown hair, large blue eyes? Did you see anybody like that? Brown hair? Blue eyes? Young? If I did, why do you think she killed him? Perhaps she was out for his money or? You're wrong, inspector. No girl took Dave. No girl could ever take Dave. I know who did it. Don't take notes from me, inspector. I'm a little nuts, I guess. Thanks, inspector. Better go home and get some sleep, Jim. Yeah. That's what I better do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. May I have your hats, please? We're not staying. Oh, dear, dear. Life seems to be just one mad rush for everybody these days. It's a butterfly existence, isn't it? We're no butterflies. We want to see Jim Connor. Oh, yes. Just one moment, please. Pardon me, miss. These gentlemen would like to see Mr. Connor. Stay where you are, you. Connor. Jim Connor. Who's he? Guy that sings at the green cockatoo. He brought you here, didn't he? Jim Connor? Sure, he left word for us. We're old friends of his. Where's he gone? I don't know. Has he got a brother? Yeah, he had one till last night. What do you mean? Some dame picked up Dave and killed him. Knifed him in her room. No, no she didn't. She never touched him. What are you talking about? That girl didn't stab Connor. Then who did? I don't know, but a man named Terrell had something to do with it. Who told you that? Connor himself, just before he died. What are you gonna do about it? Well, I don't know. I suppose I ought to tell the police. Thing for you to do is get down there right away. Don't you think so, Steve? Yeah, right. I don't know. Don't you ought to tell the police, butterfly? Protheroe is the name, sir. Well, what do you think? Speaking in generalities, being unacquainted as to the actual details of the case, I should say that conveyance of the information in question to the proper authorities would be virtually mandatory. What's he talkin' about? Well, all right, but how am I going to get to the police? Well, we're going up to town now. We'll be glad to give you a lift. Car's right outside. If you're sure it isn't any trouble. Not at all. On the contrary, you'll be doing us a great favor. All right, thank you. How much longer must we wait for your friend? He'll be here any minute. Take it easy. Couldn't he meet us at the police station? No. Why not? 'Cause he wants to tell you what to say to the police. Well, I can only tell them what happened. There's lots of different ways of putting things. Hello, Jim. Where's Terrell? He'll be along in a minute. I'll wait for him. Where's Maddison? He'll be along, too. I'll wait for him, as well. Sorry about last night, Jim. Too bad about Dave. Jim, I'm so glad you're here. Never expected to see me here, did ya? Well, I never expected to see you here, either. Not even after what the cops told me. Not even after I remembered why you were runnin' away last night. How much did they pay ya for the job? Oh, but you're wrong. I don't even know these men. They said they were your friends. I suppose they kidnapped you and brought you down here. I suppose they stood over you with guns while you stuck that knife into Dave. You didn't do a thing, did you? Honest, you didn't. But I can explain. You'll never explain that body lying up there on the slab, his face all twisted, his eyes starin' up at the ceiling and not seeing anything, his hands all dead and cold. You'll never explain that away. Not to me you won't. Holding hands and making up to me half the night. All the time you killed my brother. But I never saw your brother before last night. I was trying to find a hotel when I got off the train. He said he'd show me one. After he took me there, he came up to my room. I could see he was hurt. He could hardly stand up. I tried to help him, and all he wanted to do was get a message to you, to Connor at the green cockatoo. That's why I went there. I went there to see you. You saw me all right! Why didn't you give me the message? I didn't know you were Connor! The barman said he didn't know you and didn't know where you were! And then the police came in and I got frightened and I ran into your room! Why don't you believe me? What did Dave wanna tell me? He said, "tell him Terrell." He kept repeating it. Terrell, Terrell, Terrell. I'm sorry. They must've got him at the station. Hello, Connor. I'm glad to see you. And I'm glad to see you, Terrell. You're not leaving, Connor. I wanna talk to that girl and I wanna see you. Jim! What's the trouble? I want to see the inspector, sergeant. There's some guys in there you better take along. Jim. Don't worry about me, kid. And don't worry about yourself. Comin' to shalford, kid. This is where we stop. Yes, this is where we stop, all right. And this is where we start.
