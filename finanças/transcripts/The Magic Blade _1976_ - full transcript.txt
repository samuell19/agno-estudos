Just right The ancestral tablet of Fu Hung-hsueh Mr. Fu, please sit down What's the idea of your taking a bath... the coffin upstairs & the food here? . This means you only have two choices . One is to enjoy money & power here . Another is to become a corpse in a coffin . Our master said me must enjoy himself to the hilt on his last day you'll need drinks now After all, you're a man How do I compare with those two women? What do you mean by that? Our master wants to offer me And half of the fortune here for your Peacock Dart When I am naked, as I am now... . few men can resist the temptation I suppose I must be one of those few But the other girl you've got... . can be exchanged for my Peacock Dart Is she better than me? Don't forget, my other reason for coming . here is to see Miss Chiu Chiu Yu-cheng Over there Mr. Fu Miss Chiu Fu Hung-hsueh, if you don't hand over... the Peacock Dart before dawn... she'll die here even if you should... get out of the Tien Wai Mansion Mr. Fu, why did you come here? . To look for you What about tomorrow? Tomorrow there will be a last duel... between me and Mr. Yu But if we don't give him the dart tonight... he may never show his face tomorrow You want to give him the dart Yes, but your father told me to consult... you first before it's used. Master, here's Peacock Dart I know that only the two feathers... that can be plucked are real I know Fu Hung-hsueh's Fu Hung-hsueh. he never lies. Why did he give me the real Peacock Dart? Why did he give me the real Peacock Dart? He wanted you to release Yu-cheng first Go! Now that I know where you are... I'll come back for you You must I will Please wait, sir Mr. Yu has the dart, but dares not show up . You're wrong. I've been waiting here . Are you alone? Yes, I am along Why didn't you bring some more men? Why did you come alone? Because you're Fu Hung-hsueh. I'm Mr. Yu Either you live or I live It's between the two of us only It doesn't concern a third party The swordplay world's an independent state There can be only one ruler: you or me . Good, but before the last duel... I want to ask you a question What is it? Where's Yen Nan-fei? Didn't he die in the Tu Village? No, you're wrong. He's not dead He's still here Yen Nan-fei, take off your mask How did you know I didn't die in Tu Village? Probably you forget that no one on earth . Except Fu Hung-hsueh can kill you You couldn't have died if I didn't kill you . I know there's ambushed You couldn't have come to kill me alone Anything you don't know? I don't know whether or not you can kill me Sword One has died, and they are only four left Four have died, and you're the only one left What's the difference from last year? Last year's duel decided only the winner . Today's duel decides who will live Stay where you are The duel between Fu and Yen has ended I only want to die by my own sword Congratulations! From now on everything here belongs to you From now on everything here belongs to you Where's Yu? Didn't you kill him just now? No, he was not Yu How do you know he was not Yu? Because he didn't have the Peacock Dart Peacock Dart is a last resort If he were Yu... he would have used it to kill me You really want to see Yu? What do you see in the mirror? Myself No, it's Master Yu Master Yu is only an image It represents wealth and power Whoever's best in martial art is Yu You killed Yen Nan-fei today... so you're Master Yu For how long? Until there's someone in the underworld... who can outrival you... Then I must try to eliminate him or I'll be another Yen Nan-fei Right Whoever's the strongest is the master . Where are you going? I want to live... and I take no interest in money and power . Wait, you're now Master Yu You can't give up Why? Because I want you to be Master Yu You're the real Master Yu Right, I am Master Yu If you hadn't seen my Peacock Dart Your would have seen my grey hair which... has grown with fighting for money & power . For 30 years I've been worrying about... . my leadership I want to dominate the swordplay world... forever and ever Certainly no one would give up . his past glory Unfortunately I'm getting old and weak... . unlike over 30 years ago... when I killed 78 swordsmen... . in one night So you want to find a right-hand man Yes, I found Yen Nan-fei Unfortunately he was defeated by you Then I gave him one year to kill you . I didn't allow him to stab you in the back That explains why he didn't do it... when he had many chances to do so For I only want a real swordsman . Whether it's you or Yen makes no difference So his death means nothing to you . Of course, since there's someone better... in martial art than him I may have beaten Yen Nan-fei... but I don't want to work for Master Yu Why not? I don't want to grow old with grey hair... for the sake of money and power Nor do I want to get killed someday If you don't take the place... You'll never be Fu Hung-hsueh Why? Because I have the Peacock Dart Are you sure you can kill me? Certainly I tested the power of the dart today . You can't escape it within 50 feet So you've only one real feather left One is enough to kill you T ry it Fu Hung-hsueh The Peacock Coat was givern to me by... Miss Chiu last night The secret was revealed to me by... her father before his death He told me it could withstand the dart... . and counter it Now you understand... why I insisted on seeing her last night . and agreed to give you the dart today . Fu Hung-hsueh's Fu Hung-hsueh But Master Yu's also Master Yu The chair and traps were designed by me... in case of emergency There's no way for you to kill me After I recover, I'll tell you... . when the last duel will be Where are you going? Can't you see... . money and power are waiting for you? . Reserve them for those who seek death only!
