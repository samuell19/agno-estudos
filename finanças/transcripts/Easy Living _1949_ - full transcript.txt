Here. Before you break your neck. ─ Thank you. [ Buzzer ] Yeah? "Open up the hatch, Papy. Put out the welcome mat, I'm on my way up." It's the boy himself. He's coming up. ─ Pete? Eggs, soft scrambled. Hey Tim, put the blackberry jam on the table, will you? Pete would have to turn up today. I sure miss seeing that guy. Me too, and I work with him all day long. [ Doorbell ] Pete! ─ Hiya, Penny. Jealous, Papy? I know I'm a grump and not been around for months, but do you still love me? Say, what's different? What's happened? Your hair. Whatever happened to those little-biddy curls? You always said you didn't like them ─ Well, I don't. But I miss them. Say, you're putting on weight, and all... oh boy. I passed out cold last night on a beer. One glass. How many times did you fill it? ─ Just like the wife. Always kidding. Come on, breakfast. ─ I've eaten. Oh, soft scrambled eggs and blackberry jam. I'll eat. Why don't you and Liza come over tonight? We're throwing a party. Virgil is in town. He'll be here, too. He will, huh? You are putting on weight, Miss McCarr. You? You? Look at that grin! Ha ha. Well, that's wonderful. When? Three months down, six to go. ─ Anyone else know? A couple of people. You're not in the market for a Godfather are you? I'll be right with you. What is it, Penny? ─ Oh, I feel so sorry for the guy. That Liza. I love you. Hey, Papy. You about ready? Okay, okay. Wipe the jam off your face. Let's go, boy. Penny, persuade me to come back after dinner. I want to hear how all this came about. Ooh... that beer. I like your chilli, Mammy. Come on. You haven't been by in a long time. You want to know why, Papy? Me dropping by after all these months? I don't know why I didn't. I always come and see you and Penny... when I got into trouble. Maybe that's it. Maybe I'm in trouble and don't know what it is. Could be. Throw us a long one. Watch me. Watch this one. Farther. Hey Buddy, where's my pad? ─ Coming right up, Wayne. Your payment tickets, Don. Let me have Waldo's, too. ─ Take it easy. You'll live longer. Feel sore? Give it another pull, and pull it out. Well, good morning. ─ Good morning, Mr Lenahan. See, I told you he wouldn't mind us being just a little late. Because you're just a little late... I'll deduct just a little fine from your little pay check. Hiya, Pete. Scoop was looking for you. ─ Thanks, Ozzie. Say, how's that leg? ─ Okay. Got your gravy tickets, Pete. ─ Eh? Got your gravy tickets. ─ How many this time? Four. ─ Good. Can you sell them for me? Yeah. Get you 20 bucks a pair. ─ Swell. Your new helmet, Pete. ─ Thanks. Tough to get. Had to get Lenahan to sign it off. That's too bad. Come on, Holly. You're late. ─ Yeah. What's the trouble? Lenahan's cutting five men from the squad this week. I'm mister 2 or 3. You? That's a laugh. You're a fixture around here, Holly. Like, you and the goal posts. They tear down the goal posts every Sunday. Oh, I'm not complaining. I've had my seasons, I guess. It's just that I have no idea what to do now. None of the other clubs will pick me up. I can't see myself playing in the minors. I'm too old to take what they pay. Eight years, and I've got just nineteen hundred in the bank. Of course, it's enough to buy an interest in my aunt's bar. The only trouble is my aunt is such a thief. I'd better get dressed. Pete. They're looking for you. Got an angle. Great exploitation. The best. We'll see what happens. Holly, look... ─ I liked it in college. I wish I was still there and never had to graduate. Let's go guys. Lenahan is waiting. That's all I need. Lenahan catching me late for practice. Yeah... me, too. You? You're Lenahan's meal ticket. Hey, Buddy. Take off and fix that number, will you. Right. Hey Pete, meet Dave Argus. Hi. ─ Glad to know you, Argus. I hope you're photogenic. Argus here is Manhattan's ace sports photographer. I've seen his pictures. They're great. Maybe it's instinct or maybe I'm lucky. But when I'm around things happen, one way or another. Yeah, yeah. Manhattan's doing a spread on a football player. Naturally they pick you. King Football. Great circulation. Three million. Three million... hey, you know that trouble you were telling me about? That trouble you got and you don't know just what it is? Rub a little on me. Pete, I know you'll coöperate with Dave. I've got the announcer outside. See you later. Thanks a million, Dave. ─ You're welcome. You played with Illinois State for three years under Virgil Ryan, huh? Yeah. He's a great coach. You were two years All-American and this is your third season with The Chiefs? Last year, you got the "most valuable player" award. And you're the highest paid Pro in football. Say, you must have been talking to my mother. Yeah, yeah. Your press agent just told me. Better get your play-suit on and we'll get this thing over with. Okay. Alright, alright. Break it up. Break it up. Ready on a four count. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. Next. Next. Argus. See anything worth shooting? 24 on 3. Let's try B. Got it? Break up. Scoop... give me my camera. Camera! Set. 1. 2. 3. I can just see the caption underneath... "Sport". Didn't hit him, coach. Just bashed him. ─ I know. Wind knocked out of him, I think. Hiya, Papy. Maybe it's instinct. Maybe you're lucky. Have the doctor look him over, Ozzie. Hunk. ─ Yep? Go. Defensive assignment. Gerry, get in for Pete. Alright, gang... What did the Doc say? ─ Oh Papy, you know the Doc. You didn't see him? No... I've got a date. Oh. ─ She's dynamite. You know we've played three years State, and two years here. And that's the first time I ever saw you groggy. Like I told you. I got a date. You mean you faked it out there? Papy... You don't mind reading your crystal ball? Hey, I want to see you. On your expense account you had three bucks for miscellaneous. What’s with the "miscellaneous"? You know, with you Jaeger football is a strange sport. You see it's played on a field a hundred yards long. Goal posts on both ends. Teams line up, whistle blows, someone kicks the ball. The ball is in the air. And the object of the game is to make money. Hi. ─ Hi, Miraculous. No letters, no phone-calls, no wires. What's the matter? You still love me? Nope. ─ I'm annihilated. He's running in the fifth. ─ He'll probably come in sixth. Is Lenahan in? ─ A director's meeting. I'd stick around but I got me a date. How much do you want this time? ─ Same amount. Miraculous, didn't you ever hear of living within your income? Well, that's sentimental. Make it payable the same way? ─ Uhuh. You know it's none of my business, but... are they going to drop...? Make if fifty. Are they going to drop Holloran off the team? Yes. Tomorrow. ─ Oh. Dry your tears. Holly's been with the team eight years. He knew the train stops some place. If he hasn't saved his money and made plans, that's his own grief. You talk fast. ─ Well, this is business. Just like any other business, we can't afford to carry deadwood. You know, you really got a heart of gold. Tip your hat and say goodbye. You'll be late for your date. Am I still your favorite football player? You know, you're riding the gravy train, too. Take a good look at your ticket. When it's time to go, get off yourself. Don't wait until they shove you off. Thanks. Take care of yourself in the clinches. How do you take care of yourself in the clinches? I manage. I just follow my heart of gold. You've been around Lenahan too long. Anne... have you got the course sheets on the...? Nice view? Oh. Oh, that reminds me. Phone Tim McCarr in the dressing-room and have him come up here. I want him to learn Pete's assignment on every play. Just in case. Oh Pete, not here. ─ This is as good a place as any. Again. Say Pete, who's the dish? Mama Mia, what a dish! Okay, get on your marks. Come on. Hey Pete. Will you sign it to Liza with kind personal regards? Your check. ─ Ah... I told Penny that we'd drop over after supper. Virgil's in town. He's there. Oh. ─ Oh, what? I promised Gilbert his party. Hang Gilbert. Look Liza, you know very well we should go to Penny's. But we can't hang Gilbert. He's too important for us. What do we do? Okay, we'll compromise. We'll do it your way. We'll go to Gilbert's. Gilbert. A very nice party. ─ Glad you're enjoying it, Dad. Who is the young man at the piano? That's Pete Wilson. ─ Of course. Football. I asked you because I noticed you and he both had your eyes on the same girl. She is lovely. What does she do? She's Pete's wife. She does something besides that. What? She's an interior decorator. A little shop on Madison. She calls it Liza Incorporated. Liza has tremendous ambition. A real capacity for hard work. Is she a success? No. No talent. No taste. I'm thinking of having her redo this place. ─ Really? You know, son. I'm thinking of having my own place done over. Your apartment is a show place. I'm getting a little tired of classic. I'd like something a bit more modern. I believe she'll do very nicely. I like your apartment as it is. But you won't stop me. It's experience that counts you know, Gilbert. You win. I'll introduce you. For you, Pete. What do I have to do to make an impression? Exhale. Liza, I don't believe you've met my father, Howard Vollmer. I am delighted. ─ Thank you. If you'll excuse me, please. I know the story of your life already. ─ You do? ─ Yep. Vogue. Harper's Bazaar. Modelling. Your picture in the Ads, always wearing clothes that nobody else could wear. I've been trying to steal your husband, Liza. No luck. ─ Sorry, Billy. So am I. That Billy Duane is so attractive. Lenahan wouldn't like this, Pete. Liza... let's get out of here and go to Penny's. But I haven't had a chance to talk to Gilbert. Oh Pete, we can't go on just pouring money into Liza Inc. I thought you said this job could do it. ─ And it could. Pete, go to Penny's and Tim's and see Virgil. Talk all the football you want. It will pick you up quicker than that ever will. Say. Are you trying to get rid of me? ─ Yep. ─ I thought so. Look. You stick around. And nail the Gilbert contract. I'll go over to Penny's. Give them a quick how-do-you-do ma'am. I'll come back and pick you right up. Hat and coat, please. Liza. Remind me to tell you I couldn't live without you. I thought you two were married. Sure of yourself, aren't you? No. Just sure of you. Hi Pete. ─ Hiya, Pop. Hiya King Football. Yeah, yeah. No letters from you, no wires, no phone-calls. Don't you still love me? Nope. I'm annihilated. ─ What kind of a routine is that? Skip it. Feel sore at me? All I said was that you've been with Lenahan too long. I know that's all you said. It's my boyfriend. Hiya, Princess. Jealous, coach? Don't get any big ideas. She called me her boyfriend too. Belle calls any man in football pants her boyfriend. And what's more, they all are. Hey, Pete! Hiya, Penny. I was telling Hunk about our homecoming game with Notre Dame. We were thirteen to nothing in the middle of the last quarter. Then Rottney sent in a little fourth-string back. Who weighed only a hundred and forty. I can't recall his name. ─ Walter Werner. The kid went crazy. He made three touchdowns in six minutes. They beat us 18-13. 21-13. And I never forgot it. I'm such a poor loser. I see you're retiring at the end of this season. Oh, he's been saying that for ten years, Hunk. This year... I am saying it. Uhoh. Hiya ex-coach. Thirty-five years is long enough. Time to give young blood a chance. Come on, boys. Ever the diplomat. She knew we wanted to talk. Well Pete, you're making a lot of money. Oh, enough. Glad you turned Pro? They're a great bunch of ball-players. The Board of Control. Told me to pick the new coach to succeed me. We knew they would. That's why I'm in town. To look over the field. Why, I thought we settled that before graduating. We did. Pete... I'm not going to offer you the job. Do you want it straight? It's Liza. Liza? Pete. Belle coddles a squad of 45 boys. She handles alumni, the faculty and me. She stays in the background. Lets me take the bows and the hoots and holler. Being a coach's wife is a career in itself. Liza has her own ideas. She wouldn't want to give them up. I've got a hunch you wouldn't grudge asking her to give them up. Nice seeing you, Virgil. What kind of a season you going to have upstate, Virgil? We're not too deep at tackling God. Look, if you want to call, call. It's not as difficult as it looks. Just pick this up, listen for the dial tone Then, fixing the number that you want firmly in mind, you make so. See? Him? Him. Yeah, yeah. What goes with that Anne? Out with a different guy every night. She's going through the entire lineup. Now she's out there with that character Argus. She's ruthless. Comes with having been married to a heel. He's dead. Let him rest. He died three years ago. He left a bad memory no-one seems able to wipe out. Hey Tim, the man from the delicatessen is at the front door. Tell him to go to the back door. ─ He's at the front door, darling. Those baboons will eat you out of house and home. Maybe it's worth it. Tonight, Virgil offered me the job at State. Yeah. I know how much you wanted the job... I think I... No, I was going to say I turned it down. But I'm going to take it, Pete. Sure. Take it. It will be great for Penny and the kid. Pete. Penny called you. Yeah. Liza... is that you? Funny how you always hear me when I undress. Did you have a good time? I missed you... how was Penny? Virgil and Belle there? Did you give them my love? Yep... they were there. Did you talk enough football for one night? Yeah. What time is it? ─ Oh, its... ─ Liza! I stopped by to pick you up and you weren't there. Neither was Gilbert. What happened? ─ You want a blow-by-blow description? Cut out the comedy, Liza. ─ Always acting like a football player. What's the matter with you? When I'm in the dark, I start thinking about things. Come on. What happened at Penny's? It's the middle of the night. Gilbert. Get up in the morning. Practice. Heels. I've asked you a hundred times to get me a pair. They're flat. Virgil is retiring from State this year. I'm not going to be the coach. Tim gets it. So Pete's not going to be coach. So Pete doesn't like me, or his slippers or himself. Oh, Pete. Pete, be grateful for what we've got. Sure. You've a good five years of playing ahead of you. You ever hear of anybody getting hurt? ─ Don't ever say that. Besides, if anything happens to you... You've got a wife who's going to be rich. Look at me. I'm money from home. I'm the top floor on Radio City. The uptown, downtown kid. I'm the dotted line in black and white. Gilbert? ─ Nailed. Oh Pete, it's the beginning. They'll all be doing what Gilbert does. They'll all be using Liza Inc to redo their apartment. Oh Pete, it's us. We've got everything. You never really thought I'd put Liza Inc over, did you? Nope. Still mad? Uhuh. My arms will be black and blue in the morning. There... and there. I'm glad I woke you up. Hello? "Mr Wilson? This is Murdoch Insurance." Look, I told you when I bought that policy that that's all I want. What? "The company doctor turned down your application for insurance." The company doctor turned down...? My application. What for? Why? "Diastolic murmurs." Diastolic... murmur...? Spell it. "D I A S T O L I C." Mr Nichols, please. You must be very sick. Why? Most men when they come in here, look back at my nurse. Ah, sit down. ─ Thanks, doctor. You are from Denver? What are you doing in New York? Well, I'm a salesman. On the road at the moment. I see, a salesman. What seems to be wrong? Well, I... I've been feeling kinda low lately, doctor. And you think it's your heart? That's why you came to me. Yeah. The insurance company turned me down. They said I had a... Diastolic murmur. Or something like that. And well, being away from home, I thought... to drop in and see you. Tell me, recently have you felt as though you had a bad hangover... When you've had little or nothing to drink? Yeah... I had a glass of beer and... it hit me like that. Any spell of unconsciousness caused by a blow or a contact... Which ordinarily wouldn't bother you? Yeah. That's twice you've been right. I think I'd better examine you. The blood-count, doctor. The sedimentation rate. Thank you. Well, at least now we know I have a heart. You had rheumatic fever as a child? I don't know. The tests show the fever is obsolete. But it's left you with some trouble. Meaning what? Technically, the aortic valve leaks. Not he mitral valve which is a little more usual. Symptoms? Vasomotor collapse. In easy language, with a proper regimen, the patient can live a long time. Without the proper regimen... Just what do you mean: "regimen"? Oh, no alcohol. Smoking in moderation, if necessary. If you... if you swim, never go beyond your own depth. No excessive labor or competitive exercise. That's rough. Well... it shouldn't be... Too rough on a salesman. It would be awfully rough on a professional athlete. A football player, for instance. Oh no. No, no, no. You're no salesman. You... don't get a chest like that from watching a porter carry your bags. Okay... I play football. But why didn't... why didn't the team's doctor find it out? Well, he wouldn't unless he was particularly listening for it. Now, if I've sounded cold and clinical. It's because I found out that patients feel best when they know the facts. The truth. Now, you can live a long time. What I said isn't the red light. The stop light. It's the yellow light. Caution. The most important, and this is a thing you have to think through for yourself. Learn to live. And not be afraid. Fear kills most patients. I don't seem to make myself clear to you, doctor. I play football. I'm a professional football player. I play for a living. You know, I can't do anything else. What I want to know is can play football, or can't I? Well, I had a case similar involving a marathon runner. The 26-mile Boston race. He'd been in it 14 times and he always finished pretty far back. He came to me. I told him... just what I told you. He said he'd run his race and nothing would stop him. He ran it. And he won. Ten days later, he was dead. That's a long way of saying "no more football", huh? No more. Well, maybe I wasn't lying. Maybe I'll be a salesman after all. Or a coach? Hello, Pete. ─ Hiya, Holly. I was just telling the fellahs here, the axe went chop. No more cleats barking my shins and no more rubbing-tables. No more sore Mondays. On the other hand, of course. No more sitting on that fence during a game. Leaning back and soaking up the sun. Do you know the Panthers wanted me? They could use a good lineman. Yeah, I told the Panthers, "forget it boys". "I'm through with helmets clipping me on the chin." I'm buying into my aunt's bar in Hartford. A television in a bar nowadays, is like owning a gold mine. Pretty soft, Holly. ─ Sure. The only trouble is my aunt is such a thief. Who knows? Maybe I'll out-thief her. Maybe it runs in the family. You will still have half a second before the ball is snapped. Sure. Hollering the thief... instead of hollering the chief. Don't forget you grass-eating slugs. If you're ever up in Hartford... Hey, Buddy. I'd like to keep my jersey. How much? Well I don't know... a jersey? Keep it, Holly. I'll check in it was ripped. Thanks, Buddy. Anyway, an old jersey. Is it worth even a buck? ─ Sure. I'll... I'll hang it up over the bar. Just for luck, like they say. Gee, he didn't even say goodbye, huh? I'm late, huh? Yeah, you're late, honey. I'm in the dog-house, then. I want to wait a second, until Bill Holloran comes out. Oh? Hey... look. Are there any tears in my eyes? Uhuh. They're there somewhere. Pete. Liza Inc lost the Gilbert job today. We're right back where we started from. Further back. That's fine, just fine. What happened? Pete. If we weren't married, Liza Inc would do a lot better. Yeah? But Liza couldn't. How long do we have to wait here? ─ Oh. Just a couple of minutes. Holloran is through and I want to say goodbye to him. Washed up, huh? I suppose. I guess he can get a job somewhere but... Pete, I've got my own troubles today. Let's skip his. All the guy knows is football. That's not much education for anything. Holloran will get along somehow. People like that always do. What do you mean: "people like that"? Watch it. You're getting worry-lines. Something I've been trying to tell you. I... What, Pete? Well, I don't know how to tell you. Holly. Pete. Hello, Mrs Wilson. Good to see you. ─ Hello. I didn't get a chance before. I wanted to tell you goodbye. I'm glad you did, Pete. Oh, Holly. The Panthers need a new lineman. I'll put in a good word for you. ─ No... no. They'll have a young crew. They'll need an experienced man. ─ No, I'm through, Pete. Let's face it. That's the rough part. Making yourself face it. Once it sinks in, it's not so bad. Let me give you a lift anyway. No, you've got your wife. The subway there will do me. Goodbye. Thanks. I liked playing football with you, Pete. I suppose I was rude to him. ─ Yeah. I couldn't help it. I hate has-beens. They're not men anymore. I like my men a hundred percent. You do nicely. Hey, worry-lines. You had something you wanted to tell me? Skip it. ─ What? I... I think I forgot to tell you I love you. [ Radio: ] "For the Chiefs, the story is in the statistics." "Pete Wilson had his poorest day in many a season." "He completed only four out of eighteen passes." "He had three passes intercepted on him." You can tell when they lose. We sell more coffee and nobody buys hot-dogs. Hot-dogs? You couldn't even get ten cents for Pete Wilson. With mustard. Gather gang. Come on, let's go. Now. I'm not going to go over your mistakes with you. It's all in the statistics. Pete only completed four out of eighteen passes. He had three intercepted on him. Each and every one of the rest of you knows how and where you slipped up. But I would like to point out just one thing. If we get into the championship playoff. Every one of you stands to make well over a thousand dollars. Though we lost this game, we can still get into the playoffs. If we lose one more game. We can't. So. Let's not lose any more games. What time do we head out to Chicago tomorrow night? The train pulls out at six. Did the Tigers do any more scoring? 35 to 14. Last quarter just started. It will be tough on Sunday. They are all tough. Benny. Does this mean another operation on my knee, Mr Lenahan? That's it, Benny. Too bad I'm not an automobile. Then, all we'd have to do is put on a new wheel. Yeah. Pete. Yeah. Sorry I dropped the pass on the goal-line. You were trying to get rid of the ball too fast. Don't you want to talk? Lenahan did all the talking out there. I had a bad day... period. Something tells me my timing is off. I shouldn't be telling it to you today. You can always phone me for an appointment. Virgil did phone me... last night. The Board of Control wanted my answer. I told them I'd take the job. Good luck. No... this isn't my idea, it's Virgil's. I told him I'd pass it along. ─ Let's have it. Virgil said you might like to be my assistant. He said you might want to work with me. That's what Virgil said? I thought it was rather a wild shot. After all, I've been assisting you. I missed telling you for a long time. Second string to you at State for three years. Only reason the Chiefs took me was you told them you wouldn't sign without me. When he wanted to drop me after the first week's practice, you... You laughed in his face. ─ Yeah. I laughed. But. You told Virgil I'd drop in your lap. Well. Since you're the middle man. Tell Virgil you laid it in my lap. Only I was standing up at the time. And tell him if I ever start coaching. It will be head coach at a top school. Tell him it's nothing against you. But tell him. Hiya boys. ─ Scoop. He played a good game today. Here's the layout Dave Argus ran. Great exploitation. Thought you'd like to see it? Thanks. Three million circulation. That's fine, Scoop... just fine. Well goodbye. It's been fun. Goodbye. I don't want a drink and I don't want any coffee. I like a man who knows what he doesn't want. Did Liza Incorporated do this apartment? ─ Yes, of course. An original? ─ No. A reproduction. I told my son that as far as you were concerned, he was wasting his time. Why bother with a reproduction when you can have the original? You know the trouble with Gilbert? ─ What? You. ─ Why? You make him feel he's a little boy, so he acts like a little boy. Gilbert said you were a very clever girl. An ambitious one, too. He also said I had no taste and no talent. He's right. Why are you trying so hard to be Liza Incorporated? Is it because when you were in college you were the fair lady and... He was just one of a host of admirers? Is that it? And when you came here, he became the center of attraction and you were lost. You couldn't stand that, could you? That's your opinion. You know, the lack of talent isn't the mortal sin some people make it. Talent is cheap. If that's what you need for the success of Liza Incorporated. Buy it. No. If that's the only way I can make a go of Liza Inc... I don't want it. Yes you do. Yes I do. We'll buy it. Will we? I'll be as silent a partner as you wish. Mute? It will be a huge success, Liza. And you may take all the bows. The Chiefs leave for Chicago tomorrow, don't they? I didn't know you were a football fan. I'm not. I'm just interested in schedules. They'll be gone a week? ─ Yes. That should give us a chance to get started. Buy me the original heart. Buy it from the profits. That's what money is for: to buy things. Liza. Hello, Pete. ─ Hello. Hiya. We watched most of the game by television this afternoon. You seemed to be right in the thick of things. Oh, I played second-rate football today. ─ Oh, really? I don't know that much about the sport. One thing. You earned your money out in the fresh air. Mr Vollmer. Have you ever been kicked in the mouth? That is, to make a dollar, I mean. No. I don't enjoy working. I prefer to let my money work for me. Pete, I didn't mean to be snobbish about football. But it's just that I don't like being a spectator. Well, goodbye you two. Probably see you later tonight. Goodbye. That's for being rude to the man. But just exactly enough. I don't like the guy. He's always kinda making me feel like a little boy. Take it from me. You're not. What did the old goat mean about "he'll see us later"? How old do you suppose he is? ─ A hundred and eight. We're going over to Billy Duane. She's having some of us over tonight. Oh, that's that blond model he parades around. Count us out. ─ Oh, no you don't. These past few weeks you've been living in an igloo. Cold and away from it all. Remember me? I'm the uptown, downtown kid. Alright... where is it? ─ Where's what? The new dress. If I know my little Liza, you're going to hit that blond with a razzle-dazzle. It's just a simple little number. All it cost was a fortune. How do you like it? Well, there's a lot downtown, but not much uptown. That's the idea. Unzip me. Liza. ─ Yes? I wish you would come along with me tomorrow night to Chicago. Remember my first year with the Chiefs? You used to make all the road trips. Remember our cab drives? Dropping down Michigan Boulevard. Henry's. The Pump Room. Marshal Fields. What do you say, Liza? It will just be three of us. You, me and Chicago. Pete, you are wonderful. I'd love to go but... Liza... I wish you'd come along with me. I've been feeling low, lately. Really low, and I... Well, I need you. I know you've been low. I tried to snap you out of it but you wouldn't let me. Look, why don't you stop the hedging, Liza? It's straight and it's simple. Are you coming with me or not? No, Pete. Why not? Well, it's... because I'm jealous. How do you figure that out? When you're with the team, you're the center of attraction. I'm out of it. Perhaps I love you, Pete. But still I'm jealous. The unveiling. It's all yours. Not when I'm in Chicago. ─ You're here now. Look. It swirls. No Penny this trip. Do you miss her? ─ Yeah. What do you want? A boy or a girl? ─ A boy. Ah, boys are a headache. Cut them for luck, Anne. One for the money. Oh, I heard it before, fellahs. Looking for trouble? He's in compartment "A". It's a cinch. Just knock on the door and walk right in. Yeah, yeah. The guard and tackle switch. Instead of a hand-off, it's a toss to the man in motion. We've got to watch Lloyd Cutler on the flat. A fast breaker down the field. He can catch them anywhere. Oh... give me that again, Eddie. I wasn't following. If you're checking up for Lenahan, tell him everything is just dandy. Nope. A social call. If it's a social life you're interested in, there's forty guys out there. So they're my buddies? Just for a change of pace I wanted to be with someone who doesn't like me. Oh, in that case. Sit down. Happy homicide. I like that for a title. Yeah. You don't like me very much, do you? That's kind of asking for it. Those forty guys out there. Just because you think I've been out with almost every one of them. Well now. Well at least you've been true to the Chiefs. Not completely. I went out with a newspaper man once. That doesn't count. He was writing a book. We spent the whole evening searching The Bowery for interesting characters. Did you find any? Yep... me. I gave him an idea for an article. He wrote it and sold it to the Reader's Digest. It was called "The New York Girl". That fits you. It was full of statistics. Five nights a week on an average, a girl in New York spends by herself. The other two nights she goes out. Dinner, the movies, her door. She says it's been a lovely evening and kisses the guy goodnight. Then she goes in and reads the papers. It's what I like about New York. You can read the morning paper the night before. Say, you've got it bad tonight, haven't you. What is it? A guy. In love with him? Yeah. That old thing. I'm in love with him alright. And he's a nice guy. Why don't you tell him? He's married. It's nice to tell somebody about it. It's the sort of thing I couldn't tell a friend. Just someone who doesn't like me. Is this good? I'm half way through it. He's one of these guys they call a Private Eye. You know? Makes eighteen dollars a day and gets expenses. So far he's been hit on the head, kicked in the stomach... Knifed, Mickey-Finned, run over by a car with no license plates. Four people have died including the fool who hired him in the first place. And three gorgeous women have been throwing themselves at him. Oh... Next time you want to be with somebody who doesn't like you. Yes? You'll have to find somebody else. It's been a lovely evening. Goodnight. Anne. Stay away from Pete. Is that an order? I'm sorry. It comes from being an ex-quarterback. Hi, Anne. Hi, Mr Lenahan. ─ Goodnight, boys. You made one mistake. Marrying my son. I loved him. And what did it get you? Hit in the heart every day until the day he died. Well, that's right, isn't it? Yes. He was no good and he was my son. When he died I made up my mind to stop thinking about anything except my team. Now look, Anne. I want you to fall in love again. You should. I figure everybody is entitled to one mistake. But you made yours. Now don't got falling for a guy that's married. Give yourself a chance. You are right. You always are. If I see you make a fool of yourself... ─ What will you do? Remember the things I used to do when I was your age and keep my mouth shut. [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Yeah? Okay, Mr Lenahan. I'll come right down. I want you to take a good look at these pictures, Pete. There was no hole where you were supposed to go, so you cut back. On the ball. Look at that drive. You never let up for a second. A good straight-arm, too. It's still early season. The defensive end knocked out your blockers. So you cut loose. You crashed for ten yards with no help at all. Now this is last week's game. There's no hole so you didn't try. You didn't drive. You got tackled standing up time and time again. Now for your passing. Early season. You wait. You take all the time you can. You let your receivers get well out in the clear. You don't throw until the last split second. A nice catch by Tim by the way. It's still early season. This is a nice play. A very nice play. Watch how you get away. Look at that. Four men had a crack at you. Forty-eight yards through the air. These last few games you've been throwing too soon. There's no chance for your receivers to get in the clear. You never let yourself get hit once in last week's game. You only completed one out of every six you threw. Intercepted. Putting your hand to your helmet before you pass. It took us months to break you of that habit. Now, you're doing it again. Don't you think they're hip to it? ─ I suppose so. You've been playing at half speed. You're not playing all you've got. Look. We won all the games. Except the Panthers. Pete. I want to get into that playoff. I want to win it. It means a hundred thousand dollars. ─ And I'm just the boy to do it, huh? Look, you sit out there on that bench. We're out on the field. We're the ones that have to play. If you don't like the way I play, why don't you fire me? You own the team. You're the boss. Well, if you want Royal football, why don't you to your Royal college? I don't want to bench you. ─ Bench me? A fat chance. You built me up. You, Scoop and the newspapers. "King Football." They don't pay to watch you coach. They pay to watch me play. Enough to support all of you. Building you up? That's advertizing. That's all it is. Don't you know that? You can build anybody up. It doesn't take long. But, I don't losing. The men don't like it either. They're beginning to call you "King cripple". They're getting tired of carrying your weight. King Cripple? Why sure. Scoop had to work his head off keeping it out of the newspapers. Sorry I shot my big mouth off. Ozzie. What do you think? I trained a lot of players. Good boys. They get to a point. They go... they go fast. ─ Yep. Okay, we'll bench him and start Tim in his position. Ah, it's too bad about this boy. The game is in his blood. He loves it. When I rub him down. His muscles sing. A lot of good boys I've rubbed down. Then they get to the point. Thanks, fellahs. It's just a bad joke. They were kidding. Tim! Suppose, I had to quit? Keep your voice down. Suppose I had to quit and go to State as I couldn't get a job any place else? Suppose this and suppose that. This dead college town. Those dull day-in and day-out faces. Not for you. Are these any better? These night-in and night-out faces? Liza, I'm quitting. Your voice, dear. Please keep it low. I'm going back to State with Tim and you're coming along. Stop playing mirror-mirror. You, you're jealous. Madame? Your curry, Andre. Jealous of what? Monsieur? ─ Nothing. Just tell me. What am I jealous about? Me. My success with these people. The men I meet. That's why you want to go back to State. So that you can tuck me away in a little nest for two. You're not much fun anymore. No fun at all. I don't like being bored. Look. You've been trying to tell me something for a long time Trying to needle me into a fight. Why should I want that? If we were fighting maybe it'd be easier for you to say what you want to say. We used to fight, we'd end up laughing. Now when we fight, it ends up ugly. It's no good. No fun. We're just not right for each other anymore. Just like that, huh? We need time away from each other. A long time. A little time. I don't know. I wish we were fighting. That's the way marriages ought to break up. Not soft and easy like this. It's too easy. It's like shuffling a deck of cards. Please, people are looking at us. Your voice. It's okay to separate us. But it's not okay to raise my voice. That's not the thing to do. Have some dignity. ─ Dignity? You give me the book of etiquette for this and I'll read it cover to cover. Liza. Be careful. You're only an amateur, playing a game with professionals. He's been here before with some of the other players. For one small beer. But never nothing like this. He certainly fooled me. He just sat at the bar, that same smile on him. Before I got hip, the bottle in front of him was empty. Thanks for calling me, Danny. Yeah. I saw he was getting ready to keel, so I got him in here. Else one of them would have called the newspapers and splashed the front page. How much does he owe you? I guess you'll just have to take my word for it. That twenty-cent item there at the bottom. That's for four nickels I gave him to phone with. Whoever it was he tried to call hung up all four times. Oh excuse me. There seems to be a mild manslaughter at the bar. Pete. Pete. You're lucky. You're a man. You can come to a place like this. When I was having my share, I was home alone. And it's no good. Home. Here. Anywhere. It's no good. Sure, you stop thinking a little bit. But not thinking about your troubles doesn't get rid of your troubles. It's still there. Pete. Pete. You know where we are, you and I? This isn't Danny's back room. No. We're in El Marocco. And we walked right in just as though we come here every night. Our dinner was fine. And you danced to it. You always say you don't like to dance. It makes you feel foolish. You don't see the sense of it. But, all in all, when we do dance our once-in-a-while dance... You smile and you say: "you know, Anne. This is fun." Disagreement about whether the Republic of Chile is east or west of New York. How about him? Any luck? ─ No, no luck. Come on. I've got a cab waiting outside. We're going to take him right out there. That's it. Hey, look. They're covering up Pete Wilson. Yeah. They covered him up Saturday, too. Boys, keep plugging. It's in the car. Give it all you got. You overcharged us five dollars last Sunday. Hey, you. What do you say we get out of here? No chance. Playoffs week. I thought you'd sleep for a week. ─ I probably would have but... That maid of yours sort-of rumbled round the apartment like a freight train. Where did you sleep? ─ On the couch. You needed a bed more than I did. Yeah. I want to talk to you. ─ You talked enough last night. That's what I want to talk to you about. Liza. You mentioned it between seltzers. I never repeat what children and drunks tell me. They don't know what they say. Not my heart. You heard me. In one ear and that's where it stays. If there's anything I could do for you. ─ Yeah? Just let me know. I'll buy an Indian blanket and send up smoke signals. What are you sore about? ─ Who's sore? Out of the frying pan. What? That's me, every time. Me and my heart of gold. Are you going to get drunk again tonight? Maybe. And tomorrow night, too? And the night after that? I don't know. ─ Who's sore now? No, you're not hitting it again tonight. No? Well, just what am I going to do? Listen, I was married to a quitter. I've spent years since he died thinking of the things I should have told him. I'm going to tell them to you. That's why you're not hitting it again tonight. You're taking me to dinner. What do you want? What does any man want? Peace and quiet. Which, as yet I haven't found. Hiya, King Football. Your beautiful wife is singing all over town that you and she split up. Yeah, yeah. I'm a jinx. I put somebody on the cover of Manhattan and right away their whole world melts. Marriage. You give it a big, black mark? Hey, Scoop, Yeager. Pete would like to talk to you. I made a mistake today. ─ I don't believe it. We got contact work that shouldn't happen. What happened? ─ Tim's hurt. Bad? No, it isn't bad. It's his knee. He'll be alright in about a week. Sure he'll be alright? Ozzie says he'll have him on his feet by Saturday. He won't be able to play more than five or ten minutes of football. Here. I am buying sixteen minutes of top-flight football from you. You can call it a bonus or whatever you want. I want to win that playoff. The kind of ball I've been playing. I owe you a lot more than this. But I'll play for you Saturday. I'll play the best football you've ever seen. You'll win your playoff. All of you know the reason. Yes. Yes. I've got a pretty good idea. Hey, Scoop. ─ The boys are out there now. Oh good. Build a fire under them. Here, give him the bonus anyway. The bonus? ─ If we win. Yes, sir. Look, I'm playing Saturday and I want you to keep your mouth shut. You can't give it all you've got. Not the kind of game he wants. It will kill you. Is that it? Is that what you want? To kill yourself? ─ Well, it's my only chance. Chance for what? To be buried under the goal posts? A chance to get Liza back? That's what she's been missing. The old razzle-dazzle. Living with me lately has been dull for her. Dull for her. Well, this way she'll... When she says she's Mrs Pete Wilson, people will know what she means. That's how she is. That's how she is. Oh skip it. Look. You won't say anything about my heart, will you. I never repeat what children or drunks tell me. Or what sentimental ladies say in the back rooms of bars. What? ─ Nothing. Quite a stranger. How come you were out tonight? A full moon or something? Hello, Liza. I'm holding my own private wake. So smile for it. My silent partner. Here. Cheers. Jittery. Jittery all day. A girl I knew jumped and fell through a window. Lily Duane, top model in town had a friend, a silent partner. The friend made her top model. When he finished with her, no more top model. The build-up, then the let-down. Now, she's dead. Those things happen. Sweet talk. Oh, we went to the animal fair. I know why you're here. You want to see how I'm taking it. You watch people. You get your kicks out of watching people, don't you. You've got your own private little peephole. You don't want anything. You just want the pain of trying to get something. And when you get it...! I hate to drink. It makes me so sick. ─ Don't drink then. Just like that, huh? Everything is so cut and dried. ─ And crystal clear. You think I'm scared, don't you? ─ Careful. I thought you'd hurt yourself. You think I'm scared. You feel I'm scared the same will happen to me that happened to Billy Duane. You think I'm afraid of that, don't you? What's the smile for? Sure of yourself, aren't you. That's what you told me the night we first met. That's how it began, Liza. And that's how it ends? I called you yesterday, last night, today. "Mr Vollmer is not in". That's what they said. If you call tomorrow, they'll tell you the same thing. So nice and neat. The build-up... and then the let-down. Liza Incorporated is still yours. There's nothing before you. Without you, it won't last a week. It won't at that. You might try your husband again. Pete Wilson. Talk of the town. Big game tomorrow. Everybody is talking about him. You'll need him. You never liked me much, did you. No, I never did. I never liked you, either. You are old... you are an old man. Why don't you smile now? An old man. That's just what Billy Duane called me. Ermine and lace. "Number please?" ─ White Plains 99970. Plaza 31598. That rotten smile of his. This is Mrs Pete Wilson calling. Are the boys all in bed? "Yes, they are." Will you give Pete a message in the morning? Thanks. Pete darling. I'll be at the game tomorrow. The usual place. I love you... and I always will. Liza. Got it? Thanks. Hiya. Tim. How's Penny? Still scrambling eggs better than anyone else in the world. She asks for you all the time. Say it... takes two to play this. May I? ─ You may. You knocked me flat. I'm... sorry about that. ─ I know. Too much on your mind, eh? The old pressure. May I? You may. Pete. Hey guys... you seen Chapman? ─ Uhuh. No, I didn't think you had. He ate two dinners. One in his room and one in the dining room. Now I can't find the big ape. Say, you'd better board the bus. It's leaving for the stadium soon. Here, Chapman... here, Chapman, Chapman. Pete... don't play tonight. It's just not worth it. No-one has written an valedictory yet called "Die For Dear Old Lenahan". Who've you been talking to? ─ Me. I thought you didn't repeat what kids and drunks said. You weren't that drunk and you're not a kid. I don't like meddlers. You, you don't like anything. Not even yourself. Sure. Anne told me why you're playing tonight. Wangling yourself a razzle-dazzle build-up. Trying to get Liza back. Liza. That's enough, Tim. Getting Liza back by being a hero. And how will you keep her? By keeping on being a hero? Kill yourself so as not to lose her? That's smart. That's real smart. Are you done? Liza. Why, you couldn't even bring yourself to tell her about your heart. Could you? Could you? No. ─ Why not? Because you knew right well, if you told her she'd walk out on you. Kiss you off for good. And she's the thing you're ripping your heart out for. Brother. How wrong can a human be? Is the revival meeting over? If it's something I don't know. If it's something that makes sense, tell me. I'll fix it with the gang. We'll carry you. Hey, guys. I found Chapman. You know where he was? In the kitchen, eating another dinner. I was hungry. ─ Yeah. Any time there's a free meal. Hey, let's get to the bus. It's game time. Business is business. Anything you want to tell me, Pete? Hey, Pete. I took a message for you. Your wife called. She said she'd meet you at the same place. She sent her love. Love. Well, here I am. The final game. Just like the phone message. Final grudge? ─ No grudge, Liza. I've just been trying not to listen to things I didn't want to hear. You won't have that trouble any more. ─ No, believe me. It can't happen again. It's you. You're my life. Pete, you love me. Nothing else matters. You know you love me. Sure Liza, I love you... but love's got to stop some place. I'll live your way, give up Liza Inc. We'll go anywhere, do anything you want. If you want to start coaching, that's fine, fine with me. That's what I want. ─ We'll go back to State. Oh Pete, I can do it. I can make you the best football coach they ever had. You can do all that? ─ There's no limit. After State, we'll go to a big college. The best. They'll all look up to you. Pete Wilson. Top coach in the country. Yes. Yes, we'll start at State. We'll make Virgil give us Tim's job. It should be yours anyway. Yours and mine. ─ Sure, Liza. Take Tim's job. Get what you want. You'll never learn, will you. Pete! You better call them in, Hunk. Alright. Alright. Here's your starting lineup. Madon, Walsh. Herbert. Zipsco. Ortega. Gordon. Pazinski. Back field. Ross, Bush, McCarr, Wilson. Mr Lenahan. ─ We won the toss. We'll receive. Now, let's do some blocking. Whoever receives that ball. Be sure to get behind him, boys... ─ Mr Lenahan. Yes? I told Mr Lenahan that... I'd really be in there winging tonight. But it's no use. I found out early this season that... Bad heart. I should have stopped playing then and there but I didn't. You fellows know what... What kind of a game I've been playing. I've dogged it every time I've handled the ball. It's tough enough for you guys to play against eleven men. I don't want you to have to play against twelve. I'm sorry. Goodbye. I guess that's all. Hey, Pete. You made a big speech. I'll just make a little one. You were the best I ever had playing for me... thanks. Good luck. Hey, I love you too, Papy. Watch that knee. I'll clear it with Hulk. That's you and me. I got your contract at home. We'll do alright together at State. We'll do alright any place. Ready, Tim? Rock them, Papy. [ Tannoy: ] "Looks like a change in the lineup." "Correction in the Chief's lineup." "Schreiber, number twelve replacing Pete Wilson." Here. Now wipe your mouth. Pete, I... ─ Yeah I know. You're sorry. Look, I never slapped you before, Liza. I probably should have a long time ago. When we first came here in our broken down jalopy, everything was wonderful. You made all the trips with us. It was fun. Then all of a sudden, I became "King Football". My pictures were in the papers and everything went haywire. You started buying dresses, clothes more clothes... Parties, apartments, Vollmer, Gilbert. Then "Liza Inc". That was the topper. Well, I'm no longer "King Football". I'm an assistant coach. I'm going back to State. For $3,200 a year and you're going with me and will like it. Liza... I'm sorry that... I had to slap you. That's what has happened. And this is what you are going to get if you ever do it again. Yeah, yeah... T-G
