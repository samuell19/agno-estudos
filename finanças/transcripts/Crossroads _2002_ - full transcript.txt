You don?t like football. But you?re supposed to go, and it?s supposed to be fun. And like all the parties at Hemmings Field and stuff... I never went to any of?em. I never stayed out late. I neverjust hung out. ?Cause you had a head on your shoulders. You stayed home, and you studied. There?sjust a lot ofthings that I wanted to do that I didn?t. And I was up there getting my diploma, and I was like... ??Is this it??? Come on now. Didn?t we both work hard for this? You?re right. I guess it?sjust the pressure of graduation. You?re right. Girls, hi! Lucy. Mimi, not now. Okay? - Are you comin? or not? - Coming where? It?s graduation night! Oh, God, Hemmings Field. I totally forgot. So, are you comin? or not? I have plans. I?m sorry.

The worst thing that ever happened to you. That?s even easier. Reaching my goal weight. - You said-- - It turns out... that being prettier than my mama... is even more unacceptable. Oh,Jesus. Yep. One morning I woke up, and she was gone. Pop really wouldn?t say anything about it. I thought she was coming back, and Pop told me she wasn?t. They fought all the time. You know, I think that shejust got fed up... and took off without even thinking. And after a while, it was Just too late to come back. I know she wants to see me. She?sjust scared, that?s all. I?m gonna be so sick later. Mimi, be glad you?re pregnant and you couldn?t act stupid with us. That?s not why I don?t drink. I just don?t see the point in it. So you never partied? Once. Over Christmas. There was one ofthose parties at Hemmings Field. And this guy was drinking this beer... and I remember it was in a blue bottle. And I was real mad at Kurt because... he blew me offagain to hang out with his friends. So I had a few beers. I had more than a few. This guy, you know, he seemed-- He seemed real nice... ?cause when I couldn?t walk, he offered to drive me home. It?s no big deal, Luce. It happens to girls all the time. Did you go to the police? No. I?m from a trailer park. I got drunk and got in his car. So, Kurt?s not the father? I saw this ad in a magazine. So I called up this lawyer in Atlanta, and she sent me this stuff. Um, all these pictures and letters... ofall these people who want babies. - I was supposed to pick one. - The guy... what was his name? I don?t know. Why did we stop being friends? I don?t know. People drift apart. Promise me we won?t drift apart again. Come here. And where have you been all night? Thankyou. For what you did last night, I mean. Thanks. Scoot over. I?m never drinkin? again. Honest. This burrito is so good. Don?t mention food. - What are you doing? - Chilling. - Wake him up. - Y?all, he?s been driving all day. - We can?tjust stay here. - We should just let him sleep. - Uh-uh. - We?ll let him sleep. Lucy, get his keys. He told us we couldn?t drive his car. I can?t do that. Why not? It?s not like we?re gonna drive this over a cliff. - It?s stupid to stay here. - I?ll drive. Get his keys. - Yeah, get his keys. - Why do I have to get his keys? Because Kit and I voted and you lost. Get the keys. Yeah, Lucy, get his keys. - This is stealing. - It?s not stealing if he?s in the car. No, it?s kidnapping. Okay, stop. Oh, I got it. Go, go. You failed driver?s ed, didn?t you?

You looked so sweet when you were sleeping. - Wejust didn?t wanna wake you. - Stop the car. - It?s against the law to park here. - It?s my car. - We?re almost at an exit. - Stop the damn car! - Mimi, go talk to him. - Uh-uh, you go talk to him. - Nobody?s gonna go talk to him. - I know, he?s mad. And he has killed before. Mimi, you said he didn?t kill anyone. - I said I thought he didn?t. - Oh, my God. - It?s okay, I?ll go. - I?m sorry. God! Be careful, Lucy. - We?re sorry. - I?ve been in a car full ofchicks. Do you have any idea what it?s like being surrounded by girls? Being a girl yourself, I know, stupid question. But I?m a guy, okay? I?m a guy.Just a guy. And I have been listening to girl talk and watching you do... your girl things for days. I?m not complaining, ?cause, let?s face it, I?m outnumbered. But that?s my car. It?s my car, and it?sjust-- It?s the one thing that hasn?t been taken over by chicks. - Okay? - Okay. - Ben? - Yeah? Were you really in jail? Yeah, I was. - So you killed a guy? - What? Who said I killed a guy? Everybody back home. Oh, man. No, I didn?t kill a guy. What did you do then? I was in college, and I get this call from my stepsister. She wants me to come get her ?cause my stepdad is beating her up. My mom can?t stop him, so... I drive home in the middle ofthe night... and she throws her things out the window and climbs out... and then I drive her back to school in Ohio with me. - And you went tojail for that? - That?s the thing. There?s this law... against driving a child that?s not a relative across state lines... and my stepdad ofcourse pressed charges. But, you know, it?s okay. I only got six months... and I had to stay in Ohio for a year?s probation. My sister got to go live with her mom. You all really thought I killed a guy? Yeah. What were you thinking getting into a car with a homicidal maniac? - Why are we stopping? - You?ll see. - Mimi, you okay? - Oh, yeah, I?m fine. Look. It?s like you have to whisper. Hello! Man. We gotta make time. The next hotel is still an hour away. Ben, do you have enough sleeping bags for all of us? You serious? You really want to camp here? Yeah. It sounds like fun. You gotta keep your thumb on the outside like this. Right. Now, the trick is... you don?t want to let him know that you?re gonna hit him. Maybe like look away first. And then, when he least expects it, you throw your whole body into it. What are you doing to her? I?m teaching her how to fight because every girl... should know how to throw a decent punch. That was decent. I?m gonna go to bed. I?m gonna go to the ladies room. Where is it again? Third bush after the rock over there. - This one? - That one, yeah. What are you always writing in there? Poems, mostly. Can I hear one? Okay. One. But you can?t laugh. ??I used to think I had the answers to everything... but now I know that life doesn?t always go my way. It feels like I?m caught in the middle, and that?s when I realize... that I?m not a girl, and not yet a woman. All I need is time, Just a moment that?s mine. And while I?m in between, I?m not a girl.?? I liked it. Really? Yeah, really, I like it. - What? - You got ash on your face. - Where? - I?ll get it. There. - What?s wrong? - What happened? Something bit my ass. - Let me see. - It?s a snake bite. No, Mimi, that?s a mosquito bite. Don?t look! - How could I not? It?s nothing. - But it could?ve been a snake. All right! We are outta here at the crack ofdawn. Nothing?s biting my ass. So we?ll be in Tucson today? - Around 4:00, I think. - Are you nervous?
