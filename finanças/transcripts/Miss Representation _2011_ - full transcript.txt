The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any. -Alice Walker American teenagers spend 31 hours a week watching a TV 17 hours a week listening to music 3 hours a week watching movies 4 hours a week reading magazines 10 hours a week online That's 10 hours and 45 minutes of media consumption a day - [Pat Mitchell] The media is the message and the messenger. And increasingly a powerful one. - [Jackson Katz] People learn from media than any other single source of information. So, if you want to understand what's going on in our society in the 21st century, we have to understand media. - [Jim Steyer] If you think about media and technology, they're delivering content that is shaping our society. They're shaping our politics. They're shaping national discourse. And most of all, they're shaping our children's brains and lives and emotions. - [Marissa Mayer] If you ask me, there's somewhere more than a billion people who use the internet every single day. That's just a reach that hasn't existed before, in terms of media. - [Jim] Our kids today live on Facebook and cellphones. The diversity of the platforms means that those images are impacting your kid 24/7 and whatever restrictions existed when we were growing up, simply don't exist today. - [Jean Kilbourne] Girls get the message from very early on that what's most important is how they look. That their value, their worth, depends on that. And boys get the message that this is what's important about girls. We get it from advertising. We get it from films. We get it from television shows, video games, everywhere we look. So, no matter what else a woman does, no matter what else her achievements. their value still depends on how they look. - [Ariella] There is no appreciation for women intellectuals. It's all about the body, not about the brain. - "You all saw the famous photo from the weekend of Hilary looking so haggard, and what, looking like 92 years old." - "Breast implants-- did you have them or not? Because that's all over the internet about you and mainstream media." - "I think if you waterboarded Nancy Pelosi, she wouldn't admit to plastic surgery." - [Jennifer Pozner] The fact that media are so limiting and so derogatory to the most powerful women in the country, then what does it say about media's ability to take any woman in America seriously? - [Margaret Cho] The media treats women like shit and it's horrible and it's like, I don't know how we survive it.

When I found out I was pregnant with a girl, everything came into focus. But I looked around me and I was really frightened for her. I couldn't imagine that my daughter could grow up to be emotionally healthy and fulfilled, given our modern culture. So I'm compelled to make sense of all of this for her. And I know I have to start by looking at my own life. The mistakes I've made and the traps I've fallen into. Because even though I've had many privileges, I haven't been immune to the damage our culture does to women and girls. When I was a young girl, I felt secure in my place in the world. But as with most girls, things changed as I got older. A few days before my 7th birthday, my older sister, Stacy died in an accident. I blame myself for her death. And out of guilt and sadness, I tried to be two daughters, instead of one. I channeled my pain into excelling in sports and school. But no matter how hard I tried, I somehow felt inadequate. I became increasingly susceptible to peer pressure. And the bombardment of media messages, telling me that being strong, smart, and accomplished was not enough. To be a woman meant constantly striving for an unattainable ideal of beauty and approval in the eyes of men. So when a trusted peer and later a coach, preyed upon my vulnerability and violated me, I was so frightened and ashamed. I completely shut down. My self worth was at an all-time low. And I developed an eating disorder that consumed two years of my life. It took a lot of love and support for me to find my strength again. And although my experiences are unique, my struggle is all too common. It's always hard being a teenage girl, but now the media disseminates such limiting portrayals of women and pervades every aspect of our culture. Is it any wonder teen girls feel more powerless than ever? 53% of 13 year old girls are unhappy with their bodies Their number increases to 78% by age 17 65% of women and girls have an eating disorder 17% of teens engage in cutting and self-injurious behavior Rates of depression among girls and women have doubled between 2000 and 2010 I want a different world for my daughter and her generation. But a lot has to change first. - [Ariella] We see so much in the media that there's so much negativity towards women and their way and how they look. And it's just a representation of the pressure we feel to conform to men's ideals. There's this concept of the perfect woman who looks this certain way, and because women may not look that way, they're scrutinized. - [Urenna] I remember at 5th grade, I was worrying about my weight. And now I'm in 9th grade, I'm still worrying about my weight. - [Angelina] Me being a small person, like at my old school, I was talked to like, "Go throw up." Or like, "Go get a hamburger." Because people thought I was like, anorexic or something. So, I would like, eat a lot. So that, people would think I don't have an eating disorder. - [Alexis] I straighten my hair, just so I can fit in, when I have naturally curly hair. - [Alexis] I have close friends that in between like, break periods, they would go to the bathroom and put on ten pounds of make up, and you know, comb their hair and do all this, you know, pampering, you know and you're at school to learn. - [Maria] When is it gonna be enough? 'Cause you know, I have a younger sister She's like... She hacks herself. She cuts herself because she gets teased in school because she doesn't have the perfect body It's hard for me to see that What can I do so my little sister won't be getting hurt by the media? How long is it going to take for somebody to take a stand? How long is it going to take for somebody to take a stand? - [Jean Kilbourne] The ideal image of beauty is more extreme and impossible than ever before. In the old days, the perfection was achieved through cosmetics and airbrushing. But now, is it possible for that image to be absolutely perfect because of computers? [camera shutters and clicks] You'd never see the photograph of a woman considered beautiful that hasn't been digitally altered to make her absolutely and humanly perfect. Girls are being encouraged to achieve that ideal at younger and younger ages all the time. They end up measuring themselves against an impossible standard and feeling themselves wanting as a result of it. Also not surprisingly, young men who are shown lots of photographs of supermodels, then judge real women much more harshly. - The most important thing to understand about all of these images and how they affect us is that the effect is primarily subconscious and that it is very harmful, but that for the most part, we're not really aware of that which is why we need to pay conscious attention to these images. - [Jim Steyer] The average child develops over 18 to 24 years. And full brain development doesn't really occur until you're into your early twenties. So, the idea that kids at eight or ten or fifteen have the same level of intellectual and emotional maturity as an adult, is nuts. They have different interpretative abilities. They have different emotional abilities. And they're a much more vulnerable class in society. - [Katie Couric] I worry about, you know, how much pressure my daughters feel in a society that features anorexic actresses and models and television stars. We get conditioned to think this is what women should look like. So, even people of average weight and size have body dysmoprhic disorder. - [Margaret Cho] When I did my first television show All American Girl, which was the first Asian-American family show on television, I had a lot of problems with the network because they were constantly telling me that I was too fat. You know, I became very anorexic trying to somehow keep this job that I really wanted to keep. And you know, they ended up canceling the television show. And they replaced it with Drew Carey 'cause he's so thin. ♪ [The Drew Carey Show theme music] ♪ - [M. Gigi Durham] An aspect of media literacy education, that I think many people aren't aware of, is the whole political economy of the media. Most media get their revenues from advertising, you know. so, the non advertising content of these media has to support the advertising. - [Maria] Everybody needs to learn what the media is really about. It's really about how they want you to be something that you're not. - [Jean Kilbourne] A lot of advertising is based on making people feel anxious and feeling insecure. For men, there's a lot of anxiety around status and power and wanting to look as if you have power. At least drive a powerful car for women that you're never beautiful enough. - [M. Gigi Durham] Which is why you keep seeing these same body types over and over and over again, because those are the body types that generate the purchase of all these beauty products and thus are a futiled pursuit of this idealized body. It's a hugely profitable pursuit for these media industries and for all of the advertisers. Advertisers spent $235.6 billion in 2009 80% of the countries in the world have GDPs less than that American women end up spending much more money on beauty in the pursuit of these ideals and these myths than on their own education, which in fact, would benefit them more in the long run. And so under this rather equipped empowerment, it's completely disempowering women. US women spend $12,000 to $15,000 a year on beauty products and salon services The number of cosmetic surgical procedures performed on youth under age 19 more than tripled from 1997 to 2007 The average adult facelift costs $11,429 That's enough money to pay for: 5 years at a community college 2 years at a state university 1 year at the University of California - [Jean Kilbourne] Not only are girls seen as objects by other people, they learn to see themselves as objects. - [Caroline Heldman] The American Psychological Association has found in recent years that self-objectification has become a national epidemic. A national problem. - The more women and girls self-objectify, the more likely they are to be depressed, to have eating disorders. They have lower confidence. They have lower ambition. They have lower cognitive functioning. They have lower GPAs. How does this connect to women and leadership? Women who are high self-objectifiers have lower political efficacy. Political efficacy is the idea that your voice matters in politics and that you can bring about change in politics. So, if we have a whole generation of young people being raised where women's objectification is just part for the course, it's normal, it's okay, we have a whole generation of women who are less likely to run for office and less likely to vote. - [Jennifer] This is dangerous business. If the media sending girls the message that their value lies in their bodies, this can only leave them feeling disempowered and distract them from making a difference and becoming leaders. Women make up 51% of the U.S. population Yet comprise only 17% of Congress The 2010 mid-term election is the first time women have not made gains in Congress since 1979 At this rate, women may not achieve parity for 500 years Only 34 women have ever served as governors compared to 2319 men - [Pat Mitchell] Here we are. This massively powerful democratic society and we are not modeling for the rest of the world a better balance. 67 countries in the world have had female presidents or prime ministers The U.S. is not one of them The U.S. is 88th in the world in terms of women in national legislatures - [Gavin Newsom] If people knew that Cuba, China, Iraq and Afghanistan have more women in government than the United States of America, then we'd get some people upset. - [Gloria Steinem] No wonder we are in such trouble in this country, we've been choosing our national leadership from 6% of the country. - [Jennifer Lawless] Without more women in politics, we just don't really have democratic legitimacies. Something looks fundamentally wrong with our political institutions. - [Cory Booker] We're shortchanging voices that are urgently needed in public forums from ever getting to the table. - [Condoleezza Rice] Washington is still pretty male. And it was not unusual to go into a room and be the only woman in the room. Sometimes it mattered when there was an attempt to change Title IX and some pressure from Capitol Hill about that. I can remember Karen Hughson going to the President saying, "You can't do that. Because you don't know what it was like to be a woman in college prior to Title IX when you had to have a bake sale to get your sports team to take a trip." - [Dolores Huerta] If you have any kind of decision-making board and there are not any women on that board, they're going to make the wrong decisions. Because they don't have the women's perspective, the women's insight, the women's experience-- - [Sen. Barbara Mikulski] "It's an absolute scandal that America's women continue to earn just 77 cents for every dollar men earn." - [Sen. Amy Klobuchar] "In nine states, in the district of Columbia, women who are victims of domestic abuse, who have been victims of domestic abuse, can be denied health care coverage because domestic abuse can be considered a pre-existing condition." - [Rep. Carol Shea] "We go to the ladies room, the Republican Women, and the Democrat Women, and we just roll our eyes at them, to be instead out there. And the Republican women said, when we were fighting on the health care bill, 'If we sent the men home, we can get this done as quickly.'" [crowd cheers] - [speaker] "The United States is the only major industrialized nation without paid family leave." - [Sen. Olympia Snowe] "If women didn't speak up on these issues, and didn't become front and center, in making sure they're on the front burner of the legislative agenda, they simply wouldn't happen. I feel if it wasn't us, who would do it?" - [Marie Wilson] Women have been actually creating the best public policy in America in every state and community of this country. The living wage campaigns, Micro-Enterprise, safety, everything that needed different thinking, women have been doing it, so we gotta get them in the tables of power. - [Condoleezza Rice] Well, two things have to happen when you talk about women moving to the next rung or minorities moving to the next rung. First, we have to have the candidates. You have to have people who are in the pools from which these positions are drawn. But you also have to have a kind of psychological breakthrough or can an American see a woman born African-American in that position? Now I think with women, we still have a bit to go. - [Jennifer] I knew these obstacles still existed from my generation, but I wanted to find out if things were any better for young women seeking leadership positions. So I spent time with an exceptional young woman named, Devanshi Patel, who aspires to have a career in public service. - [Devanshi Patel] "Well, welcome to Bill Hearing. Tonight is the bill hearing night for The Central Silicon Valley YMCA Youth and Government Delegation." So, first time I ran for public office was in 4th grade. My parents award with me. We made all these flyers with all these cute little slogans and we campaigned all over the school, and I was actually the runner-up by a handful of votes. I think everyone is born with something that they have to do and for me, this was it. Every time that I could run for something, I didn't run for anything less. I didn't run for Vice President or Treasurer. I ran for President. - [Ranna Patel] I asked her one day. I think it was in 5th grade. I said, "Devanshi, you always want to be a leader, but do you know what a leader is?" She says, "It's very simple, Mama. They are just servants to people. Leaders are just servants to people." - [Devanshi] I loved the Youth and Government program. The best way I can give back is by running for Youth Governor. - [speaker] How would you solve the California Budget Crisis? Starting with Ms. Patel. - [Devanshi] I would cut unnecessary spending. Well, when I was running for office, there were a lot of-- if not outward shows of sexism, little remarks here and there, like you know, "Oh, she speaks well for a woman. She's smart for a woman." There were also a couple instances with some of my friends when they were going to speak in front of a large audience and the only thing people could focus on was their body, what they looked like, what they were wearing. I thought, you know, "We're better than this." Devanshi lost the election to one of her male opponents, coming in second. - [Ranna Patel] She said,"Mama, looks like I'm another Hilary Clinton." - [Oliver Mittelstaedt] Guys will vote for guys. And girls would vote for guys, but some other time, girls have a harder time getting the girls do vote girls because I feel like, girls are kinda harder on other girls. 65% of the 2000 teens who vote in California's YMCA Youth &amp;amp; Government program are girls. - [Jennifer] Devanshi's story made me think about how early girls face a deep gender bias. And how things have not changed as much as we'd like to think. - [Gavin Newsom] One of the first things I did when I became Mayor of San Francisco is I appointed a female police chief and then a female fire chief. When they both show up at the podium, in a disaster, a lot of national media would look there and say, "Well, where is the police chief?" "She's right here." "And where's the fire chief?" "Well, she's right here." People thought I was trying to make some grand statement, when in fact, I was actually just hiring the most qualified two candidates. The incredible opposition was coming mostly from women. And those that feel it's much too soon, too fast, they never would've question at how they've been men. - [Caroline Heldman] Little boys and little girls when they're seven years old, an equal number want to be President of the United States when they grow up, about 30%. But then, you ask the same question when they're 15 and you see this massive gap emerging. So, we have this gendered socialization, where politics is considered to be for men. Leadership is considered to be a masculine pursuit and women are discouraged from pursuing ambitious positions. You can't be what you can't see. -Marian Wright Edelman - [Carol Jenkins] I think what happens is that if you do not have women there, then girls do not see that they can be that. So, it's really what you see that inspires your idea of what's possible for you in the world. - [Krystal Ball] "I do disagree with Sarah Palin on a lot of issues, but seeing her up on stage there with her young family and her young baby was just beautiful. And I thought, 'You know what? Maybe I could give this a shot as well.'" 68% of viewers were more likely to accept a female president - [Marie Wilson] Having this opportunity to see women, to see women leadership, to see women's leadership in reality and on the screen and on the television, is huge for women. Huge. Because you don't have that many women really in leadership. So the way that it gets done to a certain extent and way problems get solved often have to do with Hollywood. And the films that get made. The documentaries, the television shows, start where people are and people are watching television. - [Jennifer] There are some examples of films and TV shows that portray powerful women. But in general, the situation in Hollywood is pretty bleak. CANCELLED AFTER ONE SEASON I decided to pursue acting professionally at the age of 28. And was hopeful I could find complex roles to play. My first reality check came when my agent told me to lie about my age and remove my Stanford MBA from my resume because it might be threatening. Well, I didn't do either. But my confidence was really shaken. My second reality check came when I learned that there were very few multi-dimensional roles to even audition for. I shouldn't have been surprised. Because when you really look at Hollywood and the films that are being made, you see the same stereotypes being portrayed over and over again. ♪ [Golds Guns Girls by Metric] ♪ ♪ All the gold ♪ ♪ And the guns ♪ ♪ And the girls (Couldn't get you off) ♪ ♪ All the boys ♪ ♪ All the choices in the world ♪ ♪ I remember when we were gambling to win ♪ ♪ And everybody else said better luck next time ♪ ♪ I don't wanna bend like the bad girls bend ♪ ♪ I just wanna be your friend Is it ever gonna be enough ♪ ♪ Is it ever gonna be enough ♪ ♪ Is it ever gonna be enough ♪ ♪ Is it ever gonna be enough ♪ - [Ilian] Women are never the protagonist. They're the ones who, if they are the protagonist, it's something drama about getting a guy or something. It's never really about finding your destiny or whatever, how they stayed for the guys. Like in the Star Trek, on this is your destiny and you know, being powerful, being the captain. But for girls, they wouldn't say that. And then, what's weird about it is that it seemed normal for us, like, we don't question it. We don't say, "Oh, why isn't the girl being the protagonist for this? Why can't a girl be powerful?" Only 16% of protagonists in films are female - [Geena Davis] I hear this all the time. Well, things are getting better. I mean, things are getting better, you know. But, they're not. - [Caroline Heldman] Mainstream movies are genuinely stories of men's lives which revolve around men. And then we have this sub-genre called, Chic Flicks, which are stories of women's lives, which when you look at them a little more closely, you realize that they generally revolve around men's lives, too. They revolve around trying to get a man, trying to get love, get married and get pregnant. - "It's my fault that I'm alone on Valentine's Day. My closest relationship is with my Blackberry." - "Right." - "Thank God it vibrates." - [Geena Davis] Between 1937 and 2005, there were only 13 female protagonists in animated movies. All of them, except one, had the aspiration of finding romance. - [Lisa Ling] As a culture, women are brought up to just be kind of fundamentally insecure and always looking for the time when that knight on a horse will come and rescue us or provide for us. - [Caroline Heldman] When it comes to female leaders in entertainment media, we see the bitchy boss who has sacrificed family and love to make it to where she is. - "I said to myself, 'Take a chance. Hire the smart, fat girl." - The whole movie is about bringing her down a peg and this is generally done by someone who is under her, a subordinate, typically a male, so that image doesn't bode well, when it comes to ideas of women in leadership. - [Paul Haggis] We had many more interesting characters on screen in the 20s, 30s, 40s than we do now. And we allowed women to really embody all the conrtadictions that make up a human being back then. They could be the femme fatale and then turn around and be the mother. And then turn around and be the seductress. And then turn and be the saint. And we accepted that. They were complex human beings. Now we really like to put people in boxes. - "The only two choices for women: Witch and Sexy Kitten." - "Oh, you just said a mouthful there, sister." - As men, we do it because we don't understand characters that aren't ourselves and we are yet willing to put ourselves in the skin of those characters and women, I think, terrify us. We tend not to write women as human beings. It's cartoons we're making now. And that's a shame. - [Caroline Heldman] Throughout any type of mass media there is, we see the widespread acceptance of women as sex objects. In rock videos, rapping, hip hop videos. in all the summer blockbusters, women are basically just body props there for young male viewers. - [Joshua] I think when they do put in the part, she's used as a sexual object or the object of desire a lot toward the men, which I think should change a lot because there's still a lot more to women than just a body. - [Jackson Katz] We're socializing boys to believe that being a man, means being powerful and in control. [thud] [kissing sound] [slapping sound] - "Brianna." - Being smarter than women or better than women or our needs get met first in relationships with women that's not genetically predestined. That's learned behavior. - "You don't think I can be a surgeon? I can be a surgeon." - "Surgery's hard core." - "I'm hard core." - "You won't last the first year, babe." - [Caroline Heldman] We also see a new incarnation of this, where women appear to be empowered. They are carrying a story they're the action hero. But again, when you peel back a layer or two, you discover that it's not really about their agency and I call this archetype, the fighting fuck toy. [missile fired] ♪ Ooh. Don't speak, even whisper ♪ [explosion] - "Now that's a bad ass chick." - Because even though she is doing things supposedly on her own terms, she very much is objectified and exists for the male viewer. - [Geena Davis] In G rated movies, the female characters are just as likely to be wearing sexually revealing clothing as in R rated movies, which is horrifying. "Ratings Creep" shows that movie ratings categories contain MORE violence, sex and profanity than a decade ago. - [Jane Fonda] The hyper sexualization that occurs in Hollywood, it's toxic. There's no question. It affects all of us including young girls who are seeking an identity. More than 20% of teens have sex before the age of 14 - [Pat Mitchell] If the message is that women are objectified, objects that that's their primary being, that's a very tough and challenging message for young women. To think that's their paths to power. Laurence Fishburne's Daughter Released a Sex Tape Because of 'How Successful Kim Kardashian Became' - [M. Gigi Durham] You know, they'll say Madonna is tremendously empowered or Angelina Jolie, but they all embody that exact same definition of sexuality. I mean, when you really think about it though, Hilary Clinton's tremendously empowered. She's Secretary of State, right? Or you know, you think of women CEOs, or you know, there are women who are empowered in lots of different kinds of ways, but you don't see them represented. You don't get that message that you don't have to use your sexuality to attain empowerment in the world. - [Gloria Steinem] A male dominant system, our patriarchal system, values women as child bearers period. So, it limits their value to the time that they are sexually active, reproductively active and become much less valuable after that. - [Martha Lauzen] What we see on broadcast television is that the majority of female characters are in their 20s and 30s. That is just a huge misrepresentation of reality. And that really skews our perceptions. Women in their teens, 20's and 30's are 39% of the population, yet are 71% of women on TV Women 40 and older are 47% of the population, yet are 26% of women on TV It's like when a female reaches 39 or 40, she simply needs to go away. - [Daphne Zuniga] One day, I got the call that I had heard about others getting and that was this. I had just gotten a series and it was presented to me by my managers, "Daphne, you're part is secure. But would you consider doing a little Botox or collagen or something?" Well, just like them, I didn't know what the hell it was. "What do you mean Botox or collagen or something?" And I remember lying in this chair with this fat bald man injecting, needles in my forehead, bleeding and I'm crying and I'm feeling guilty for crying. I remember lying in that chair just thinking, "There's something wrong here." It really made me feel less spiritually whole person, less of a woman with integrity. I felt like I was cheating and lying with this stuff in my face. So maybe I'll stop working. I don't know. But just right now I have chosen not to do it again. My mother was furious. Wanna hear what my mother-- the hippie in Vermont said? "You tell those fuckers to get penis implants." [laughs] - [Jane Fonda] This is not new, you know. I started out in the business in the 50s. My very first movie, I played a cheerleader and Jack Warner was the head of Warner Brothers and he sent word down that he wanted me to wear falsies and my director, Josh Logan, asked me to have my back teeth pulled out. You know, I wasn't good enough the way I was. - [Jennifer Pozner] I really truly believe that reality TV is the contemporary cultural backlash against women's rights. - [speaker ]"Ms. Blondie... " We have to watch out for her body, too. Her body is a little thick. - I think one of the worst stereotypes in reality TV is this notion that women exist to be decorative. Women exist to be stupid. Women are considered gold diggers. Women are considered bitchy, catty, manipulative, vindictive, not to be trusted, especially by other women. "You are a piece of [bleep] and you're a stupid blonde." - "I think you look like a ho." - "Slap me, bitch." - "Or what?" - "You motherfucking whore!" - This notion that women are natural enemies vying for the prize of being more beautiful than the rest or the love of whoever, is so counter to women in real life. - "Please, pick me, pick me, pick me. See how beautiful I am." - [M. Gigi Durham] There's a really unequal power relationship going on there, where it's the girls whose bodies are on display and the boys get the power to arbitrate and judge, whether their bodies are acceptable or not acceptable, desirable or not desirable. So, I think there's a whole lot going on there that actually puts girls in a really disempowered position. - [Jennifer Pozner] These shows over the course of the last decade, have tried to portray a world in which, the only options available to women mimic the 1950s model of femininity, in which women's only power was her beauty, in which women not only had no choices, but shouldn't have even wanted any, in which men wore burdens with the responsibility of being the prince charming, who comes in and whisks women away to happily ever after. Then has to provide for their financial security. Nobody wins in this model, but women particularly, lose in this model, where they're expected to look like Miss USA, have sex like Samantha on Sex and the City and think like June Cleaver. - [Jennifer] And here's something I find even more disheartening. Watching the news. So many female journalists are objectified or sexualized. - ♪ [CBS theme music ] ♪ This is the CBS Evening News with Katie Couric. - "Hi, everyone. I'm very happy to be with you tonight." - [Carol Jenkins] Katie Couric was the very first national experience we had all together viewing. The woman who was not entertaining us, but whose presence and presentation was vital for anything information that we needed. - [Katie Couric] The three major evening newscasts had been dominated by white males. They had very similar faces and very similar backgrounds for the most part. I thought this is an opportunity to mix it up a little bit. I also thought it was an important message that a woman could be as confident as a man in an important powerful role. - [Carol Jenkins] And I remember in the early days, when I would get calls from reporters about, "Ah! That we have our first woman anchor. What do you think about that?" Inevitably, the questions that they would ask first, were, "What about those legs?" "Do you think she was showing too much leg?", or "What about that winter white, wasn't that a big mistake?" They were all observations that had to do with her physicality and not really about the content at all. But again it's because as I've always said, "We are a nation of teenage boys." We don't know, you know, what to make of this woman sitting in front of us and so you know, we look at her legs, her boobs, her hair, her whatever, you know. Then maybe way down the line, we'll get to listen to what she's saying. - [Rachel Maddow] Ever since I've been in media at all, even since, you know, the first morning show that I was on in Holyoke, Massachusetts, you know, I was this sidekick newsgirl. There's been like a really consistent proportion of-- I don't even know if I call it criticism. Essentially, it's hate mail. As I've become sort of better known and I get more feedback, the amount of "I hate you, homophobic. I hate what you look like. I'm gonna kill you." Like threatening mail stuff, it's like the proportions has stayed exactly the same. It's always 14% of the feedback and it's almost all of the hate mail is about gender and sexuality. I mean, who has the time if that's really what you think and you really are that bad a speller, like you really, you're still gonna take this time to let me know what you 'thunk' about-- [laughs] about what I look like? - [Lisa Ling] It's the scrutinization that women get that far surpasses the scrutinization that men get. I don't ever see gossip columns or tabloids reporting on Brian Williams' personal life, yet Katie Couric and what she is wearing or who she's dating is headline news. - [Katie Couric] I think whenever there are two women who are working in similar professions, it's automatically positioned as a cat fight. Diane Sawyer and I were pitted against each other as if, you know, we were gonna be in a mud wrestling competition on the weekends. And you never saw that with say, Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings. - "Take it away with the red hot boys in blue, which--" - "I got this one down." - "Okay, good." - Sometimes I look on the cable news channels. I see women wearing very low cut shirts and lots of makeup and you know, their hair is kind of tussled and they look like they're working as cocktail waitresses, instead of newscasters. It's just a very mixed message. - [Jay Leno] "Folks, we're gonna play a game. I'm gonna show you a photo of a woman. You have to guess, whether she is a professional newscaster or a Hooters waitress. Are you ready? Here we go." [audience laugh] - [Jennifer Pozner] The local news anchorships look like, you know, somebody's grandfather and his second wife. - [Katie Couric] Television's a very visual medium, obviously, and it's kind of how do you walk the fine line of looking pleasing and attractive, but also looking professional. I look back on my Today's Show interviews then I think, "Geez, my skirt is way too short." I sometimes worry that I started this thing with my legs and everything that I have sort of started this trend of trying to look, you know... I don't know. - [Lisa Ling] There is so much pressure to look a certain way. When I'm on television, I never try and explicitly dress sexy. I don't want to distract from the stories that I'm telling. - [Rachel Maddow] I want you to focus on what I'm saying. There's a lot of words in my show and I work really hard on getting them in the right order. [laughs] For some people, I will always be too hideous a creature to be on television. That's fine. But if you can get over that on day one, it's gonna stay the same for the whole time that I'm on the air. - [Katie Couric] I think it's really hard for women today. - [Jennifer] The emphasis on women's appearance affects more than just women on screen. It's affecting women's ability to participate in the political process. Ironically, the more power women gain, the stronger the backlash against them. - And this phenomenon is most evident in the way the media disrespects our female leaders. - "She's irresistibly cute. Let's put it that way. In the way she presents herself, obviously, she's attractive and all that." - "Sarah Palin looks really hot in that hat. She's just sad that she doesn't know how cars work. Aww, that's crazy. Have you seen the hat on her?" - "Both you and Sarah Palin are good looking women. I mean, you're attractive, young, relatively young women. -"Kagan is gonna put on the US Supreme Court as there's such a thing about the aesthetics of the appointee. Let's put that here that so she's not your type of face you'd wanna see on the five dollar bill." - "I think I'm gonna send Sotomayor and her club a bunch of vacuum cleaners to help them clean up after their meetings." - "Cynthia McKinney, the former congresswoman from Georgia was another angry black woman." - "Look at these ugly skanks who make up the big female leadership of the democratic party." - "You know that ugly hag, Madeleine Albright, remember her? A psycho. She was the Secretary of State under Clinton, remember? Like a fat moron." - "And now we have the wicked witch of the west, you know, that Nancy Pelosi." - "I think if speaker Pelosi were still incapable of human facial expression, we'd see she'd be embarrassed." - "Nancy Pelosi, that-- Get another face lift, lady. Another reason why it's very rare. The final woman worthy of serving in political off--" ♪ Ding dong, the wicked witch is dead ♪ - "And it's bye bye, Pelosi." - "And Hilary Rodham Clinton, her thighness, is no better than Dumbo with the big ears." - "When she raises her voice and when a lot of women do, you know, it's as I say, it reaches a point where-- - "Yeah, well, look, you know what?" --with every husband in America has heard it one time or another." - "You get a woman in the oval office, the most powerful person in the world, what's the downside?" - "You mean, besides the PMS and the mood swings." - [Pat Mitchell] There's probably no more powerful influence in the way we view power than the way media treats power. And media treats power as defined by men, because it has been throughout our generation and the ones before generally define that way. - [Erika Falk] When press representations of women who are, you know, running for the highest office in the land are focusing, for example, on how women look, instead of what they've done or their issue positions. That's got to impact the audience in terms of how they evaluate and judge those women. One of the things it does is it trivializes them. It makes women seem less powerful. - [Jennifer Pozner] During the Democratic National Convention in '84, when Geraldine Ferraro was running, she was introduced on national television as, "The first female vice presidential candidate. Size six!" So this is not new. - [Debbie Walsh] My colleague did a study looking at Elizabeth Dole and her race for President, she was coming in second in Iowa at the time after George Bush and there was much more coverage of her appearance than there was of the substance of what she was talking about. - [Jennifer Lawless] When I ran for Congress, I was campaigning at grocery stores and a woman came up to me and she put her arms around me and she whispered, "Don't worry, you don't look nearly as fat in real life as you do on TV." The week before the election, a man came up to me and he said, "You know, you seem great, but I don't feel like I could vote for you for Congress. I feel like I should hire you as a babysitter." - [Nancy Pelosi] When I first ran for public office, which is now over 20 years ago, although my youngest was a senior in high school, the question I was most frequently asked was, "Who's gonna be taking care of your children?" And of course it's one of those questions that I don't think a man has ever been asked when he has run for office. - [Erika Falk] If you look at the women who ran, who had honorary titles like, Senator Clinton, if the press drops that title and instead refers to them as Mrs. Clinton, this is a way to kind of diminish some of her accomplishments. In John Boehner's first four weeks as Speaker of the House he was on the cover of five national weekly magazines. In Nancy Pelosi's four years as Speaker of the House she was on the cover of zero national weekly magazines. - [Dianne Feinstein] There is such a thing as a media bias. For example, media will write in the same way about a man and a woman. Senator X is a woman, complained that-- and in the same thing, Senator Y, stated that-- So the man will get the stated and the woman will get the negative verb, complained. - [Erika Falk] Women were twice as likely to be described emotionally as were men. And by painting women as more emotional than men, we perpetuate this stereotype that women are emotional. Therefore, they're irrational. Therefore they can't handle a crisis. Therefore, they should not be in leadership positions. - [Condoleezza Rice] I remember so many times during the campaign, people asking, "Will she tough enough to be Commander-in-Chief?" Well, I've know plenty of men who aren't tough enough to be Commander-in-Chief and nobody asked that question. - "Making sure that these kids have a shot at the American dream... [sobbing] ...my God, it's important." - "Gosh. What do you think they would have done to Nancy Pelosi if she hadn't gotten all worked up? They would've said she's unstable, couldn't do the job. Ooh, yes. Welcome to America." - [Pat Mitchell] A woman in power is often seen as a negative thing. We associate all the worst aspects of power and we translate those to a woman seeking to achieve power. - [Caroline Heldman] One of the key ways in which media played a role in the primary, was to talk about Hillary Clinton's ambition as though it were a bad thing. - "When Barack Obama speaks, men hear, 'Take off for the future'. And when Hillary Clinton speaks, men hear, 'Take out the garbage.'" - "When she reacts the way she reacts to Obama with just a look, the look toward him, looking like, everyone's first wife standing outside a probate court." - "I don't know what they're getting at here, Tuck. But what do you think are they saying about Hillary?" - "I don't know, but that is so perfect, a guy would have often said." [both laugh] "When she comes on television, I involuntarily cross my legs." - "I know you do." - Hillary Clinton had hecklers following her saying, "Iron my shirt." - "And some people think - [Hecklers shouting] "Iron my shirt!" - we bring about saying, I--" - "Iron my shirt! Iron my shirt!" - She was frequently called a bitch in mainstream media. - "She's a stereotypical bitch, you know what I mean?" - "Obama did great in February that was because it was black history month. And now Hillary is doing much better because it's white bitch month, right?" - "If she knew how it made her look, so alternately sappy and bitchy, she'd stop it, but she can't help herself, can she?" - Her credentials were constantly questioned. - "Let's not forget and I'll be brutal. The reason she's a US Senator, the reason she's a candidate for President, the reason she may be a front runner, is her husband messed around." -"Yeah, but--" "That's how she got to be Senator for New York. We keep forgetting it. She didn't win there on her merit." - [Carololine] Sarah Palin presented a very different image. She is the first national high profiled female candidate who presented herself in very feminine terms as a "real woman." - "She's the American dream. Women want to be her. Men want to mate with her. I wanna lay her next to me in bed." - There were pictures shot between her legs of folks at the Republican National Convention. In a nutshell, she was pornified and ditzified "I don't wanna say she's a ditz, but last night, my stripper's fake name was Sarah Palin." [crowd laughs] - "Yo, let me tell you somethin' 'bout Sarah Palin, man, [all laugh] she's good masturbation material." - [Together] Oh! [all laugh] - So, Hillary Clinton tried to be properly masculine and properly feminine and she lost. Sarah Palin puts out this different image of, shall we say hyper femininity, and she gets beaten up in really degrading gendered ways. - "But tonight we are crossing party lines to address the now very ugly role that sexism is playing in the campaign." - "An issue which I am frankly, surprised to hear, people suddenly care about." [crowd laughs] - "Reporters and commentators stop using words that diminish us, like pretty, attractive, beautiful--" - "Harpy, shrewd, boner shrinker." [crowd laughs and applauds] - [Cory Booker] My worry is now that there are millions of people watching Sarah Palin, Hillary Clinton... I could talk to about a lot of women there in New Jersey politics. There are millions of young women watching this and the messages that they're getting are just not conducive to encouraging them to put up with this kind of abuse. - [Gavin Newsom] When you're not treated the same, you are dehumanized. When you're not given the same opportunity, you're dehumanized. When people look at you differently because you happen to be a woman and you happen to be in a position of some influence that someone who is a man, would naturally be in based on tradition or history and people question your qualifications, that's dehumanizing. - [Thomas] Empowered women in general, threaten men because they feel that an empowered woman is just putting down a man as opposed to trying to sort of raise herself. - [Jackson Katz] As women have been challenging men's power, in business, in the professions, in education, and in politics and other areas of social life, the images of women that have been flooding their culture, have been showing women as taking up less space. They're less threatening. They're highly sexualized. And therefore, a certain kind of power has been taken away from them, which is a power of being a whole person. And I don't think those things are coincidental. I think that the way that the symbolic realm has been acting as to take power away from women, while women have been challenging men's power in the concrete realm. - [Jennifer] It seems we become numb to the insidious ways the media holds women back when it misrepresents them. I can't help but wonder, who are the people behind the scenes making these crucial decisions about what we see? And what are the consequences for my daughter and her generation? - [Barbara J. Berg] The media has always been, overwhelmingly, in the hands of men. Women own only 5.8% of all television stattions and 6% radio stations. - [Jennifer Pozner] As you go up the ranks in media, fewer and fewer women and people of color exist at every rung of the ladder. Women hold only 3% of clout positions in telecommunications, entertainment, publishing and advertising. - [Carol Jenkins] That means that 97% of everything you know about yourself and about your country and your world, comes from the male perspective. It doesn't mean that it's wrong, it just means that in a democracy, where you talk about equality and full participation, you've got half of the population, more than half of the population, not participating. - [Pat Mitchell] Many years ago, I said, "Why don't we just create our own network, other than continuing to try and get our stories told by other people's networks?" So, we put together an idea. We went to various distributors, including the broadcast networks, the cable companies, etcetera, pitched the idea and one person said to me, "Well, why do we need another women's network? We already have one. We have lifetime." Meanwhile, there are 22 ESPN sports channels - [Martha Lauzen] There's a fairly pervasive sense of denial about the status of women working in both television and film. Peter Bart wrote a column in Variety, talking about the glass ceiling and how it no longer exists. Putting that kind of information out there is really troublesome. Women comprise only 16% of all writers, directors, producers, cinematographers and editors. And only 7 % of directors and 10% of writers in film are women. - [Lisa Ling] For so long it has been an industry dominated by men who just don't leave. - [Lindy DeKoven] People who employ other people tend to hire people who are a reflection of themselves. - [Barbara J. Berg] This impacts hiring. It impacts the news, directors, the journalists, the people who are gonna cover the news, and of course, who reports the news? Very much is the factor in what kind of news is reported. The average number of news stories about women and girls is less than 20% - [Martha Lauzen] When any group is not featured in the media, they have to wonder, "Well, what part do I play in this culture?" There's actually an academic term for that. It's called, symbolic annihilation. [nuclear explosion] - [Geena Davis] All of Hollywood is run on one assumption that women will watch stories about men, but men won't watch stories about women. And all the decisions are made based on this concrete fact and nobody's ever really proved that that's true. I think it's a horrible indictment of our society, if we assume that one half of the population is just not interested in the other half. - [Catherine Hardwicke] The first couple of scripts that I wrote, of course, had a female, you know, as a lead character and people will look, "Well, there's hardly any bankable actresses." So, they can't carry a film. So, it has to be super low budget or we wouldn't bankroll it and no one's gonna show up in the theaters and I finally wrote the lowest budget movie I could ever write. I co-wrote Thirteen with a 13-year old girl and it was about people of lower income. They could wear my clothes. We could shoot in my house. We could use my car. We made the movie and it went on to Sundance and it went on to win awards and get international distribution and I think it was the same like, with Twilight. Two major studios turned it down. Finally, a new upstart company showed me the project and it turned into obviously, a phenomenon making over half a billion dollars so far. So, it is proved the theory that girls and women wouldn't go to see a movie, but they did go see the movie in droves. And over and over and over. And bought the DVD and even bought pillowcases. But there is a flip side to that, which is kind of astonishing to me. On the next two Twilight, they've hired guys. They did not seek out a female director and on the same side, I've gone after some jobs that I've been told flat out to myself and my agent, "Oh no, we think a guy should direct this." And to me, I think, "Okay, can a man direct, you know, Sex and the City, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, the Miley Cyrus movie?" Nobody ever questions that. But I, a very successful female director, cannot direct a movie that should be done by a man. - [Jennifer Todd] But nobody says, "I'm not gonna hire a female director." On their list, there's just 25 names and none of them are women. - [Paul Haggis] What happens is, these studio chiefs who-- or people like myself, you know, writer, producers or directors, we see the world in a certain way and we don't really challenge that often and so we just replicate the world that we grew up in without really asking why we're doing it. - [Martha Lauzen] What is the first thing that they tell people when they're, you know, in a screen writing class? Create what you know. When you have greater diversity behind the scenes, not only do you get more female characters on screen, but you get a different kind of female character. You get a more powerful and multi dimensional female character. - "You should have seen the way those men looked at me." "For them, they discovered, I was fearless!" - [Rosario Dawson] That's why it's extremely important for women to be writing their own stories. Truly crafting those stories, writing them down, directing them, and giving them to people to really emotionally become impacted by because when my mom tells me a story or my grandmother tells me a story, I'm riveted. [women laughing] - [Geena Davis] None of us had any idea what the response was gonna be to Thelma and Louise. One time I was at a red light and I heard this honking and I looked next to me, and it's a car full of women who are popping out of all the windows and the sunroof and going, "Whoo-hoo!" [laughs] I'm like, "Well this is certainly never been a reaction to my any of my other movies." Then the very next movie I made was A League of Their Own, where I had 13 or 15 year old girls coming up to me with the same kind of reactions, "Oh my God. You have no idea that movie changed my life. I played sports because of that movie." And it really struck me how few opportunities we give women to have that kind of experience watching a movie. - [Katie Couric] The media can be an instrument of change. It can maintain the status quo and reflect the views of the society. Or it can hopefully awaken people and change minds. I think it depends on who's piloting the plane - [Jennifer] I don't want it undervalued, the tremendous progress women have made in America. But if we look closely at the way our history has been recorded, we start to understand the crucial role media has played in defining who we are. - [Barbara J. Berg] Patriarchy really is America's default setting, where men hold the positions of privilege and power. And where women very often are treated as second-class citizens. It's always been problematic in American society when women have gained power. ♪ [Jazz music] ♪ During the World War II, 6 million women were pulled into taking care of the factories in the absence of the men. By the time the war was going to a close, 80% percent wanted to stay at their jobs. When the returning GIs came home within two days of victory in Civic, 800,000 women were fired from the aircraft industry and other companies began to follow suit. We needed a huge media campaign to get these women back into the home. 1947 Newsweek prints, "For the American girl, books and babies don't mix." Bestselling Modern Woman states, "An independent woman is a contradiction in terms." One of the most effective ways to do this was through television. So, the television was part of the re-domestication. 1948 1 million homes in the U.S. have TV sets 1948 Father Knows Best We had television shows sponsored by numerous commodities. The gleaming appliances that June Cleaver would use in the kitchen. These commodities were being linked to the good life. Women rush to their new shopping centers in their brand new cars and loaded up. They didn't realize that they were actually doing this in the service of the strong governmental imperative. The notion of the commodity boom was linked to Capitalism, which our government was supporting. These evade the threat of Communism. 1959 CBS becomes the largest advertising medium in the world So, you really see the linkage of advertising on TV, the pushing of Capitalism, and then our government pushing Capitalism to it. ♪ [I Want it All by Jules Larson] ♪ Now, fast forward to the once where we-- ♪ Well, I can't help myself ♪ ♪ I want it all ♪ ♪ and I start to fall ♪ ♪ I can't think at all ♪ ♪ 'cause I want you ♪ ♪ want you ♪ ♪ want it all ♪ ♪ And I'm standing tall ♪ ♪ So don't make me crawl ♪ ♪ I just want you, want you ♪ ♪ want it all ♪ Women went from being bard accessed to the institutions of higher learning.

There was a huge well-funded message machine of conservative bankers and the de-immunization of the word 'liberal.' If you took an oppositional view, New World, almost un-American. And who were the great targets of this media machine? The Women's Movement and Feminists because we were seen as posing the greatest threat to the social order of America at that time. "The feminist agenda is not about equal rights for women. It is about a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to have their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians." - Pat Robertson "Women's lib is a total assault on the role of the American woman as a wife and mother and on the family as the basic unit of society." - Phyllis Schlafy "America's decline as a world power is a direct result of the feminists' movement for reproductive freedom and equal rights." - The Christian Voice 1982 The Equal Rights Amendment fails to gain ratification - [Jackson Katz] Anytime you move forward in a culture, there's gonna be a backlash that's gonna try to move backwards or stop the progress. And so it's a constant tension between trying to move forward and advance the project of human, you know, happiness and equality and justice and everything else. And at the same time, you attempt to maintain the existing power structures and that tension is a constant tension. - [Jim Steyer] Starting in the 1980s, ruling under President Reagan, we started de-regulating the media industry in the United States. And the same people who hung their hat on the mantle of family values, were the same people who de-regulated the media industry. The Chairman of the FCC, Mark Fowler, in those days, referred to the television set as just another piece of hardware. And therefore it should be regulated or not regulated in the same way that toasters are or washing machines, but you're talking about images and messages that shape our entire society, our culture. And to cut back on the regulatory structure that oversees that, led to a lot of unforeseen consequences when it came to messages and images for young people, particularly for girls and young women. What you saw was more and more content, fewer and fewer limits on that content and a lessening of standards. By the time you got to the Telecomm Act of 1996, you had the chance to potentially re-regulate, if you will, the media industry. But in fact, that did not happen. - [Barbara J. Berg] We have huge corporate conglomerations controlling television, radio, cable, news papers, movie theaters, theme parks, huge amount of power in this country and most of these conglomerates really operate with an eye focused on the bottom line, not on fair and balanced reporting. - [Jennifer Pozner] You have Fox News on Bill O'Reilly, developing an entire strategy to corner the market in sensationalistic news just to sell us, get eyeballs, etcetera and then all the other major news outlets on cable trying to compete, so that who gets to shout the loudest becomes a standard for the news practice. - [Rachel Maddow] I could be delivering the same script with the same graphics in the same studio wearing the same thing, but on two different days. I could be delivering it like this, or "I could be delivering it like this! And if I'm delivering it like this, I'm gonna get double the rating." Okay, so that's why people yell. - "I know that's a sexist comment--" - "It totally is." - "--but it is this truth to it." - [Jehmu Greene] The rise of punditry in America is greatly adding to sexism and bias in the media. And also, confusing what is fact and what is opinion. - [Jennifer Pozner] You have less and less minutes devoted to the pursuit of strong, independent, long-term investigative journalism. More minutes devoted every year to celebrity news, to gossip-- Why? 'Cause it's cheap. Fifteen years ago, it would have been unthinkable for Britney Spear's panties to be a breaking headline on CNN. - "I wanna lead with the Paris Hilton story-- - "No. And you know what? - "What's happening with Paris?" - "So does my producer, Andy Jones is not listening to me. He's appointed us the lead. Listen, I just don't believe in covering that story, especially not as the lead story in the newscast when you have the daylight today--" - "Can we show some footage of Paris? - "No! No, we can't. - We have Paris walking out of the prison last night." - So, no. I'm gonna do the news now." - "I haven't thrown it-- There she is." - "Look at that strut." - "Oh, look at that. She's so humble." - "Like a reformed woman." - "Yeah, she was reformed." - "She's shy." - "Alright, to the news now." - " 'cause she found Jesus." - [Jennifer Pozner] Just months after Telecomm '96 passed, Access Hollywood debuted and E! news debuted. These are two of the most sort of fat-shaming, info-taiment outlets we have today, where they follow around women who have eaten a muffin and then circle their stomachs with graphics and point to them and say, "Baby bump? Are they pregnant? No. Sorry. She just ate a bagel." - "After photos of the singer performing in her trademark Daisy Duke jeans shorts showed off an unflattering belly bulge. Jess' reps were forced to publicly state, 'She is not pregnant.'" - This notion that these media companies are just giving us what the public wants. No. They're giving us what the media companies want. They're giving us what the advertisers want and they're packaging it in such a way as to make it sound like it's our fault and it's not. - [Caroline Heldman] This is the first time in human history that marketers have dictated our cultural norms and values. And this is made possible by the relaxation of rules on advertising in the 1970s and 80s. 1980 Congress weakens the Federal Trade Commission's power to stop "unfair" advertising. And then it amplified relaxation starting in the 90s. 1990s Studies find a steady increase in explicit sexual images in advertising. - [Lindy DeKoven] This is all about Capitalism. The television industry targets men 18 to 34 because it's harder to get men to watch television. Women watch television so the advertisers encourage the networks to come up with programming for men 18 to 34, so they can sell their products to them. - "Great!" - "Hate!" - "Less filling." - "Great taste!" - The exploitation of women's bodies sells products, magazines, etecetera. - "Can you open this?" - "Sure." ♪ Isn't it wonderful ♪ [woman moaning] - There has been some discussion that advertisers are themselves, men who are 18 to 34. They are saying this is the kind of programming we want. If you show a woman scantilly clad, maybe that's an opportunity to get more viewers to your show. - [Marissa Mayer] And right now, advertisements are really the best way to support a business on the internet. - "Click on me and let the show begin." Sometimes, what will draw the most eyeballs at least in the voyeuristic sense is something that, you know, might be more salacious. [woman moaning] - [Jim Steyer] In the old days, there used to be a thing called, the family hour, which was a voluntary agreement of the three broadcast networks. Remember those days? When you couldn't air anything inappropriate for children and families before 9 pm at night, where, in return for the free airwaves, they felt that they had a very major public interest commitment. It's actually enforced by the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC. That is gone today. Period. End of story. Today, it is the wild, wild west. It is a free-for-all. And there's no sense among folks who run the media and tech industries, perhaps with the exception of older broadcasters, who remember the good old days, that they have an obligation to public interest. "We have no obligation to make history. We have no obligation to make art. We have no obligation to make a statement. To make money is our only objective." - Michael Eisner - [Malkia Amala Cyril] It's a myth, that we live in and under and with a democratic media. We don't. - [Jim Steyer] When it comes to the politics of all this, in the last 25 years, our law makers have essentially been absent. Out of the picture. 1972 Surgeon General's report cities link between screen violence and aggressive behavior. 1976 American Medical Association calls TV violence an "environmental hazard" 1982 National Institute of Mental Health says, there is a clear link between TV violence and aggression. 1985 American Psychological Association shows link between TV violence and real violence 1992 American Psychological Association calls for federal policy to protect society when research on violence is ignored 2004 The Centers for Disease Control finds that media violence enhances violent behavior 2007 The FCC unanimously recommends Congress regulate TV violence 2007 Congress holds special hearing on the prevalence of women's sexualization in music videos 2009 Studies prove exposure to sexually implicit video games and music videos is linked to men's acceptance of rape myths and sexual harrassment Despite all of this, there have been no policy changes You got a situation where the law makers who you would hope would represent the broader public interest are in a sense-- I hate to overstate it, but are largely in the pocket of the media industry. Because their fortunes as politicians are dependent upon the media coverage as well as their ability to buy time in those media stations when they're running for office. Media has not been held accountable by our elected representatives and it's not a liberal or conservative issue, it's an American issue and an American problem. - [Malkia Amala Cyril] Without a media sense, when that's publicly accountable, what you have is not only widespread content bias, but what you have is a completely inaccessible public conversation. - [Jim Steyer] For years, the media industry hid behind the label of censorship. It's not censorship to say to a media company that's producing an image or a website that's really offensive and really inappropriate. That's the essence of free speech. But in a world of a million channels like we have today, people try to do more shocking and shocking things to break through the clutter. And often times, they resort to violent images or sexually offensive images or demeaning images, 'cause they know it'll get attention. The problem is, kids are exposed to that with very little or no mediation. - [Jean Kilbourne] These images are part of a cultural climate in which women are seen as things, as objects. And turning a human being into a thing is almost always the first step towards justifying violence against that person. 13-year-old girl gang raped by three classmates 7-year-old girl raped on school bus by teenager Two-year-old girl raped at SeaWorld 1 in 4 girls experience teen dating violence 1 in 4 women are abused by a partner in their lifetime 1 in 6 women are survivors of rape or attempted rape 15% of rape survivors are under the age of 12 Rape survivors are more likely to Suffer Depression Abuse Alcohol and Drugs Contemplate Suicide - [Jennifer] If the cards are so heavily stacked against young women, how are they supposed to achieve their potential and become leaders? We can't turn a blind eye to how the media impacts our culture and harms both our daughters and our sons. 1 in 18 men in the U.S. is behind bars or being monitored - [Jane Fonda] We have to help our boys when they're really young. Five or six, when they're just entering formal schooling. Help them not bifurcate their head from their heart, not become emotionally illiterate and feel that they can't show emotion, that their sissies if they cry, that they can't be expressing love. - [Jackson Katz] If a man is taught that he's supposed to be smarter than women, he's supposed to make more money than women, he's supposed to have more respect than women, yet it's not true in real life, you know, his boss might be a woman, his doctor might be a woman. The woman might be making more money than him. The girl next to him in class is smarter than him, etcetera... What does it mean to be a man? - [Kirk] If guys don't show this masculine side, then they're criticized for it and they're kind of another looked upon as less of a man. - [Jackson Katz] Now, how do we expect our sons to be men of integrity and of conscience and to be social justice advocates and just treat women with respect and to speak up when they see women being treated with disrespect, if they don't see their fathers doing it, if they don't see men in the public culture doing it, it's not fair to put the burdens on the shoulders of boys or even young men. Even though, they're part of the solution, there's no question. This is about adult men. - [Calvin] I definitely am not one to conform to the-- we need to be hyper masculine and we need to be misogynistic stereotypes. It really puts a lot of pressure on me when I have relatives who have grown up with this phenomenon, who attempt to put me on that path, but I'm not ready for it. - [Cory Booker] I remember sitting down having this conversation with a woman far wiser than me and stories to talk about, "Oh, how bad it is for women in America," and she just looked at me and listened to me for a while and she said, "Well, I have to tell you, Cory, I actually think it's really bad for men in America." And I go, "What do you mean?" She started talking to me and really putting the spotlight on me and talking about how emotionally constipated men are taught to be very early on, how we don't have-- haven't learned how to express ourselves in healthy ways, it often does manifest itself in such awful and violent ways. But she talked about a spiritual healing that was needed for guys. - [Jennifer] I've been trying to imagine a better world for my daughter's generation. And I'm beginning to get some ideas. "The numbers of women in leadership positions in our country are still very low." We have to find a way to change this culture. We need to shift our focus from the bottom line to one of social responsibility. We need to challenge the media conglomerates to value women for more than their youth, beauty and sexuality. And we must hold these companies accountable. We need to encourage women to discover their true power, so they can become leaders. And we must support them on their journey. 70% of women in the workforce are mothers yet we have no national paid family leave, childcare or flex time policy And ultimately, we need to live our own vision of what a woman can be. Be the change you want to see in the world. - Mahatma Gandhi - [Condoleezza Rice] We make a mistake when we say, you have to find role models who look like you. If Sally Ride, my dear friend, first female astronaut had been waiting for a female astronaut role model, she would never have done it. And so, I'm a big believer in finding your role models wherever you can find them. In people who inspire and stimulate you for whatever reason. - [Jan Yanehiro] Growing up, there was nobody who looked like me on television, so I never dreamed that I could be on television. I would love to say, "Yeah, there were some great women role models back then." Actually, there were none. Years later, Connie Chung went on television to report in Watergate, and I would say to her, "Connie, you're my role model." She would say to me, "Jan, but I'm not that old." And I say, "Yeah, you're a year older than I am, Connie and that's good enough for me." - [Katie Couric] In terms of my role models in television news, of course, Barbara Walters, Lesley Stahl, and believe it or not, Mary Tyler Moore. I grew up watching that show and the notion of a woman making it on her own and working at that TV station, I think was, very, very influential. - [Rachel Maddow] One of the things that really surprised me was the number of women in positions of power in television who reached out to me and said, "Can I take you out to breakfast?" "Can I take you out to lunch?" "Can I make sure that you have my phone number or my email address, so that if anything comes up--" and it definitely wasn't like a gender mafia going on in the media, but there was an over effort to both welcome me and make me know that women who had gone before me, who had fought to get where they were, were both happy that I was there and wanted to be resources to me. And there's an expectation that I will be a resource to other women. - [Jennifer] When women mentor each other, it can be incredibly powerful. I got to know a talented young journalist named, Jessica Shambora. Jessica was covering a story for Fortune magazine about mentorship. That really proves the point. - [Jessica Shambora] I just wanted to introduce myself to you, guys. I'm Jessica Shambora. I'm with Fortune, and so we'd be covering the event tonight. Mini-mentoring is a program that a couple of the women from Fortune's most powerful women Summit came up with, in order to reach a larger group of young women who really have this desire to be mentored and get advice from successful professional women. They would have sort of like, a speed dating night, except for substitute, mentoring for the dating. - [Dee Dee Myers] The most important thing that should drive decisions, especially when you're young is what really get your heart pitter-pattering. - [Candy Crowley] In the end, here's the deal. You wanna be so good at what you do, that they can't ignore you. - [Dana Perino] Turn off the television and read. One hour of reality TV can be fun. Four hours is like destructive. [others laughing] - [Susan Molinari] To thine own self, be true. Know who you are. Know what is best about you. Have confidence in yourself and don't try and be anybody else. - [Dana Perino] On Tony Snow's last day, when he was leaving the white house and I was taking over officially as the White House Press secretary, he came into my office and he said, "You are better at this than you think you are." - [Susan Molinari] I hope you will remember that you will help that next generation of women a lot. It is far overdue that we, women, stop criticizing each other, the decisions and the life decisions that we make and instead say, "Alleluia, sister. Whatever gets you through, I'm there to support you." [cheers and applause] - [Lisa Ling] You know, if women don't stand up for each other, then no one else will. No one's gonna look out for the interest of women, except other women. - [Katie Couric] If women spent more time helping a sick neighbor or volunteering at a homeless shelter, or focusing on how to use all their energy to solve some of the world's problems, if they spent a tenth of the time thinking about those things than they do thinking about their weight, I mean, I think, we'd solve all the world's problems in a matter of months. - [Dianne Feinstein] We're here for an instant in an eternity. And all that really matters is what we do with that time - [Pat Mitchell] We have enormous power. Eighty six percent of the purchasing power in this country is in the pockets of women. Well, let's use it. I mean, let's use it not to buy those tabloid magazines and not to support the tabloid television shows. A consumer's voice is maybe the most important, powerful voice we have, other than as a citizen and using our vote. - [Nancy Pelosi] Women in America will be more encouraged if they could see young women who share their experience raising a young family, speaking for them, identifying with their aspirations. - [Rosario Dawson] We're creating new leaders and they're going to not look like how they always did. An older white male. They're gonna look like a woman and they're gonna look like people of color and that is the true reflection of this country and of this world. - [Marie Wilson] I got this little letter one day. "Ms. Wilson, do you realize there has never been a woman president?" And then she said, "I will make a great president. I'm practicing my piano, I'm doing my Math and my name is Alexandra, which means leader of men." - [Jennifer] Look at the eyes. Oh, honey. - Oh, oh, oh. - Hello. [giggles] - Hello. Oh, she's smiling. On September 18th 2009, I began my journey into motherhood. My husband and I have the same wishes for Montana that any parents have for their child. We want her to pursue her purpose and passions in life and to understand that what's really important is who she is on the inside. And it's critical to us that all girls grow up in a world where their voice counts, where our culture embraces them in all of their diversity and where they're afforded equal opportunities to succeed in life. I keep coming back to my early years. Too often, we girls and women don't recognize our own internal strength. I now know that we can't let anyone or anything take our power away from us. What do you think, Montana? Are you ready? - If we really want things to change around you, here's what you can do. Text REPRESENT to 313131 - Measure yourself by accomplishments and not by how you look. - If you and I, every time we pass a mirror, downgrade on how we look, or complain about our looks, if we remember that a girl is watching us, and that's what she's learning. - Reflect on the ways you may contribute to sexism. - I include myself in this. We scrutinize the women. "God, look how old she's gotten, look how gray she's gotten. What is she wearing?" I think that as women, we need to stop that destructive behavior that we inflict upon each other and ultimately onto ourselves. - Support media that champions accomplished women. - We need strong women role models who in the media because they did something, because they're doing great work, not because they have the most bangin' body and they're sexiest woman of 2010. They're the best philanthropists. They're the best in the medical field and it's not about the way they look, it's about who they are inside. - Boycott magazines, TV shows and movies that objectify and degrade women. - Speaking your mind and criticizing media companies when you think they're doing things that are inappropriate at your children, is not just your God-given right as an American, as a parent, but it's also entirely consistent with the First Amendment. - Go see movies written and directed by women. - And it's important to go on opening weekend and Friday is best because these are the numbers that Hollywood tracks. - Write your own stories and create your own media about powerful women in non-traditional roles. - My daughter, when she was nine, she wrote this little screenplay and she shot a movie you know, with our little video camera, with her you know, casting her friends and it was just so much fun for her and it teaches them that the media are a construction. And they start to understand that these are stories that people are telling them and they can come up with their own stories to tell back and very often, they can be you know, subversive stories, resistant stories. - Teach those around you to look at the media critically. - Well, one thing that I do with my kids, is I watch these shows with them, I say, "Hey, did you notice there's only one female in that group?" and, "What if that character had been a girl, instead?" and, "Why is she wearing that when she's trying to rescue somebody?" - Ask your school to start a media literacy course focused on gender issues. - We need media literacy as much I think, as we need to learn to read. Our responses should be, "Whose perspectives are framing this story?" "There are always more than two sides to every story." "Are we being sold here?" - Don't be afraid to challenge your friends if you hear them saying derogatory things about women. - King said it very eloquently, "The problem today is not the vitriolic words and the evil actions and the bad people, it's the appalling silencing and inaction of the good people." - Find healthy role models and be a mentor to others. - Encourage women to become leaders - and support them in the process. - If we see women who we think would be excellent at any political job, whether it's dog catchers, school board member, or member of Congress, we need to make that known. - "Whatever women do, they must do twice as well as a man to be thought of as half as good. Luckily, that's not too difficult." Miss Representation would not be possible if one woman had not initially believed in another. Thank you Regina for your trust in me and our team. May we all make empowering other women and girls a priority.
