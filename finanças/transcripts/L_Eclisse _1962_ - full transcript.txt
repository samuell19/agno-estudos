ORIGINAL STORY AND SCREENPLAY WITH THE COLLABORATION OF DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY DIRECTED BY - Well, Riccardo? - What is it? Everything we talked about last night. Yes. Let's decide. I've already decided. - I'm leaving, Riccardo. - Are you going someplace? It's the last time. - No, Riccardo. Please don't. - What do you want me to do? Tell me what it is and I'll do it. I promise. I'll do exactly what you say. Find something for me to do when you're gone. I wanted to make you happy. When we first met, I was 20 years old. I was happy then. Listen. I meant to tell you I brought the translation of that German article. I'm sorry I won't be able to do this work for you anymore. But I know someone who can. I'll ask her, if you wish. Besides, it wouldn't be right for me to keep doing it. Although, if you really want, I can continue. Is that what you wanted to tell me? - I'm leaving. - Wait. - What is there to wait for? - Please wait a moment. We've avoided saying certain things. Why bring them up now? There are some things you'd never tell me. You're not cruel. - I'm cruel with you. Perhaps, Vittoria, but it doesn't matter. Be good and tell me one last thing. Don't you love me anymore? Or you just don't want to marry me? I don't know. When did you stop loving me? I don't know. Are you really sure? But there has to be a reason. I understand these things. I know you understand them, but I don't know. - I wanted - - To make me happy. You said that. But to go on, I have to be happy too. Please. Let's not start over again. Is there someone else? No, I've told you a hundred times no. May I call you in a few days? I was thinking - Forgive me for not offering to come with you. Riccardo, let me go on my own. On foot? Then I'll come with you. Why do you want to come with me? I've always come with you. Why not today? Have we ever gone out together in the morning this early? It's open. Don't you want some breakfast? I'm not hungry, Riccardo. I'm not hungry. It was a terrible night for me too. I'm sorry. Good-bye. No, I mean - No good-byes. We'll call each other. No, we won't call. Take care. 1,413. Yes, 2,700. - What's it worth to you? - Is 10,000 okay? No, Fiat went from 2,930, closing at 3,053. Excuse me, miss. Do you have any information? Just a minute. I just found out Finsider is going up. Buy me 50,000 for now. I want 20,000 Finsider at 20! I'll sell 5,000! I'll buy 30,000 Finsider at 20! - What the hell are you doing? - Gambling. - I made a million. - Bravo. Proietti, can you let me in? Just this once. How come you're here? Well, I - Do you think we should buy? I'm going to buy. - Who can say? I bought Finsider at 20. Look at it now. - I've got 2,000 myself. - Keep them. They'll go up. You don't know me, but I know you. How are you? I have to inform you of some sad news. Our colleague, Mr. Domenico, died of a heart attack today. Our emotions at this moment prevent us from finding suitable words to describe our friend. I ask that we show our respect by a few moments of silence. It's like a moment of silence for athletes. Did you know him? Sure, but you know one minute here costs billions. - Where are you going? - Wait for me outside. I'll join you in a minute. Want to know how much I made today? - Mama, I have to tell you something. - In a minute. - Are these pears good? - Very good. I'll take two pounds. - Two pounds and one ounce. 190 lire. - I have to pay for the ounce too? Come on. You're not going to haggle over 20 lire. Just remember: Millions are made one lire at a time. Are you eating with Riccardo today? Yes, with Riccardo. - Excuse me. - What's going on, Anita? Nothing, but that hammering on the wall made a lot of noise. Giorgio woke up complaining that my friends keep late hours. I'm sorry. Come in. He's leaving tomorrow to deliver an airplane. For three days he's talked about nothing but that plane. Oh, my, I'm getting fat. If I could only give up sweets. You've lost weight. I don't know how you do it. Yes, but from the inside. I didn't get any sleep last night, yet I don't feel a bit tired. Did something happen? We spent the whole night talking things over. And for what? I'm so tired and depressed. Disgusted and confused. What can I say? There are times when holding a needle and thread, or a book, or a man - it's all the same. Want me to answer? Tell them I've left. Hello. She asks if we'd like to keep her company. I hardly know her. All right. We're coming. - Evening. - How are you? This is Marta. I've done nothing today but meet new people. Lucky you. How come you're still up? When my husband's away, I can't sleep well. And with this heat - You should be used to it. Isn't it hot in Kenya? - Not like this. At least not where I'm from. I sleep better when my husband's away. Nice bed - so low and big. What lake is that? It's near Nairobi. It's called Naivasha. There's another one here. See? We have a beautiful farm there. On the left. - Here? - No. Further over. - Over here? - Yes. It's full of tropical birds and hippopotami. Don't the hippopotami bother you? Not at all. They come out at night and eat with the cows. One hippopotamus can eat an acre of grass by himself in a night. Every now and then we had to kill one. - Did you kill this elephant here? - No, my father did, but I was there. Weren't you afraid? No, I was born there. Are you afraid of cars? Look at these books. That's Kilimanjaro. Well, well. The snows of Kilimanjaro. Elevation 19,600 feet. These are the Zambesi Falls. Kenya is one of the most beautiful countries in Africa. Nicer than the Congo, Rhodesia, Somalia, South Africa. There are trees up to 200 feet tall. This is a baobab tree. Kenya has everything: jungle, snow, savannah. Look like her? Identical! Just a second! That's enough. Let's stop playing Negroes. Why hasn't your father come back? He has his farm and horses in Kenya. He raises ﬂowers. But I'm afraid somethings going to happen. Don't start speaking in English. I don't understand it. I was saying they've all gone back to carrying guns again. Really? The six million Negroes want to throw out the 60,000 whites. We're lucky they're still in trees and have barely lost their tails, or they'd have already thrown us out. About time, too. I'll just say one thing. There are about ten leaders who've studied at Oxford. The others are all monkeys - six million monkeys. But if you like it there, they must be charming monkeys. Look at the Congo, for example. After finishing first grade, they all think they're leaders. Then let them finish second. Why did you go back to Kenya to have your baby? It's my home. Besides, it was a very modern clinic. - The dog got out! - How could it? If the door's not chained, the rascal opens it himself. My husband goes crazy if he's not here when he gets home. I don't think I'll ever go back to Kenya. My husband doesn't like living there. We're very close, like this. But there's this wall. Here I only go out to shop. Where else would I go? - You like being alone? - It's not that I like it. But I'm not with my people. - You mean the monkeys? Maybe you think less about happiness down there. Things just unfold on their own. Am I wrong? But here everything's so difficult. Even love. Look, there they are. Zeus! Marta, which one is yours? The black one. It's a poodle. Any problems between the two of you? Listen, I have to tell you something. Listen to me. Franco, it's Vittoria. Stop kidding around and help me. I've left Riccardo and - Finally! This is serious! He's downstairs. I don't know what he wants. No, don't come over. If I need you, I'll call. I wanted to tell you. This is a difficult time for him. Try to stay close to him. I'd rather be close to you. Why don't we get together soon? Takeoff on 43, Rome, over. What's the hardest thing about ﬂying a plane like this? Getting where you want to go. - Did you remove the pilot cover? - Yes. What did Rome say? That there'd be scattered cumulus clouds. But I see a solid bank of clouds over there. We'd better veer to the left and come back in later. What kind of cloud is that? Looks like a nimbostratus, though they're usually much lower. - You're my nimbo. - It's so huge. It's like it's lit up from inside. They're made of water drops and snowﬂakes. There! Let's go inside that cloud! - That was lovely. - I'm glad. I'm gonna make a call. - I'll check in. I'm going with you. I'm going with him. Want to come along? Ah, here you are. They're coming for us in a minute. It's so nice here. Take it easy on the orders. The market's a bit inﬂated. Don't buy too much right off. I don't like the Russians' attitude. Besides, it's hot, and people tend to sell before a vacation. You feeling warm? Cute. Looks like an electric razor. Imagine if people saw me with this. Give it to Dino. It's more his style. A thousand Finsider at 520. Delfino! I sold 500 Viscosa at 840. 500 Fiat at 120. - Good work, Shorty. - Screw you! Boys, who wants to join me in the bedroom? What an ugly whore you'd make! 400 Anic at 17. Foscolo! I'll buy 500 Viscosa at 215. - At 45, not 15. - I have them down at 15. - What should we do? - Split the difference. Attention. Mediobanca: 134,500. It's Florence. Mediobanca opened at 700. Should I buy a couple hundred? Centrale opened at 22,000. 400. 600. How's Viscosa doing in Milan? Stet opened at 4,600. Bye. Lucca? Yes, it's dropped. Mediobanca 700, Centrale 600, Stet 4,600. - Go, go! - Give me Mediobanca! - How much? - 702. Forget Mediobanca. You're too late. We'll tally up later. Milan on the telephone. There's something in the air in here today. Why don't you try some air freshener? - Got any tips? - Yeah, but I keep them to myself. She's a jinx. Worse than a rattlesnake. How are we doing? - Not great. What I sold rose today. Let's see if this salt brings us some luck. The numbers on that board never stop spinning. Did you sell anything? - A little Marelli. - Good. The way things are going - I didn't sleep all night. All I could do was play solitaire. Marco? 4,060 for Sviluppo. I'm on for 2,000 Fiat at 490. Let me speak to the manager. Yes, I loosened up a bit. The market's a little weak. Have you heard anything from the secretary? See how well Rumianca's doing? Must have invented a new soap for the bidet. - Piero! - What? Pirelli's down 100 in Milan. Opening price of Immobiliari: 1,453. Call Milan. Find out what's going on. - Pirelli: 10,500. - Sell! It closed at 9,700. Damn them! - Do I hold or sell? - Relax. You can always sell later. Do just the opposite of what they say. They'll stab you in the back. - What'd she say? - She's crazy. - What should I do? Did you sell? - No, I'm waiting. I've told you all morning not to buy too much. Enough! If you're dizzy, have some coffee. Is Milan on the line? - Not yet. Miss, you're a fucking whore if you don't get Milan on the line now! Generali: 66,000. 410. What? It's at 70? Sell! There's no more money. Don't push it. Nothing's selling here. Should we sell? Get me Zennaro 358269. You'll only make the price drop further. No, I meant selling in Turin or Genoa. It's like this everywhere! What price did you sell at? 10,500. It's now at 7,300. You want to cover your losses? Okay. Every 200 points it sinks, I'll cover you 500. Does that suit you, you damned cheapskate? Even Frankfurt is selling. That's right. Frankfurt-on-Main. They talk about Frankfurt, but it's always them, the socialists, who spoil everything here! I was about to call you. Do we cover it or sell everything? I don't intend to increase my losses. Strike some average. - As you like. - I heard about some loans. Yes, 300 billion in treasury bonds. Want me to find out? How would you do that? I saw you last night. Nice action. I know that girl. Never mind that. Concentrate on the action here. Thieves! It's all a plot. Scoundrels! Profiteers! Good for you! Madam, you threw a notebook. No, I threw two! What's happened? You ended up doing well. Aren't you happy? I'd like to poison these scum and their lowballing tricks! Have you seen my mother? Why are you here? Who told you to come? Come on, Mother. Let's go. Where should I go? Home. You waiting for a brass band? What home? Everything's crashing here. To think things were going so well. Where'll I get the money to cover my losses? I need millions. Where will I get it? You could have waited to make your brilliant move with Riccardo! The market always has ups and downs. It's normal. It's not normal! Somebody's always pulling strings. Politics! Right. But I can't stand to see you like this! Are you coming? This business with the leftists - Is this serious? Is it fixable? With money anything's fixable, especially here. But for some, it was a complete disaster. What about my mother? I don't know. Probably lost 10 million lire. Maybe that's a lot for her, but think of the billions lost this morning all over Italy. Look at that poor guy. He lost 50 million. A Pereguil, please. - What can I get you? - Mineral water. Mineral water. Was I right or wrong when I said to go easy? But we've got guarantees from our clients. Just be careful. Either they cover us or they cash out. May I offer you something? Yes, thanks. Excuse me. A telephone token. Somebody wants to use the phone. An iced coffee. - He drew some ﬂowers. - Who? The man who lost all that money. It went badly this morning, didn't it, miss? You never stand still. Why should I? All those billions lost - where do they end up? Nowhere. The guy who wins takes the money, right? From the guy who loses it. It's not that simple. But if someone loses, where does the money go? But why was Martinetto the only stock that didn't drop? It's a small stock. Bye. I've had enough. May I come? Where are you going? Where else? To see my mother. She's not the type to draw ﬂowers. - Do you want one? - Here, a present. - I've already got one. -1,200. Forget it. I never understood this obsession. I'm sure my father doesn't mean a thing to her anymore. Sometimes she wonders if he died a painful death. He was so strong. I don't remember him. I was too young. This is what Mama's afraid of: poverty. That's what everyone's afraid of. I never think about it. Just like I never think about getting rich. Is this your room? My gosh, how I've changed. Look! I don't know how I was ever able to sleep here. Maybe you were shorter. Not really. Mother says I was tall at 15, much taller than now. Ah, you're here. I'll put up some of my jewelry as collateral. Have you eaten? - Yes, thanks. Then I'll fix myself something. Listen, can't we work something out to - Assicuratrice: 91,270. Edison's always been a winner for me. They'll get back on their feet. They're talking about stocks on the radio. - You listen to the radio? - Those rotten - They were talking about - Tell the clients how things stand. Start with those who have the most invested. Remember, the market reﬂects an industrial situation that's still sound. Liquidity is still very high. Other countries are stepping in. The Swiss are buying. They always buy. The point is, somebody's buying. The Bank of Italy's giving extra time to those in shaky positions. And there's always hope the government will take some measures. We're a little heavy. What are you doing about Tonini? - I sent a telegram. - Where? - Riccione. They'll find him. How can you let clients go without getting their new address? I don't. They leave on their own. He owes four million lire! I don't get it. You're shrewd and smart. But then you pull crap like this! Franco, get me those records. - Where's Franco? - He's buying some stamps. What's wrong with you? Upset you have to work late? Who said anything? It's me. Shall we get together tonight? I don't know. Wait for me at the usual place. Stop telling me to be on time. If I'm late, have an ice cream. What else can I say? Bye. I don't even want to talk to you. How many ways do I have to say it? Now that you've lost, it's my fault. In the past you just took the money, and it was, “See ya later!” You've got your troubles, I've got mine. Tough! Listen. Give me some credit. Don't make me sell everything! You can't speculate with my hide! If the market drops, I pay. If it goes up, you win - is that it? I know it's not fair, but what am I to do? It's 10:00 and I'm still explaining this to you. When you first came to me, you only had 500,000 lire. Remember? Sure, I remember. In two years I earned you seven or eight million. Then I told you to stop, but you were too greedy. Where are those millions now? You must have bought something. No, I didn't buy anything. Then it's your fault! Come up with it somehow! Cough it up! Good night. - A drink? - A small one. - Maria? - I've lost even my appetite. I know why you're so angry. You'll see him tomorrow night. There's always another sunset. I saw him watching the sunset last night with a short little guy. Night. A little weeding out now and then is a good thing. Leaves the better clients standing. Those with stronger nerves. Bardini just called. He lost 100 million. Didn't bat an eye. What a guy. Please. I don't have the strength to lift a finger. - Where are you going? - I've got a hot number waiting. What did you do, dye your hair? Just a little darker. Don't you like it? You were a blond when I met you. I see we're off to a good start. Are you gonna stop it? Sure. - Shall we go? - You want to go somewhere? What are we going to do here? You're right. You go and I'll stay here. Hello, sweetheart. And just who are you? What are you writing? I'm translating some Spanish. How do you say “I want to come up” in Spanish? You say, “You can't.” Tough language, isn't it? I don't see why we should waste time like this. Neither do I. I bet that's my car. It was the drunk that just went by. He had to take my car. I'm sorry. Where's the police station? I don't know. - There must be taxis around. - I'll phone. Where is it? Show me. I'm glad you insisted I come. - There's a dead body. No! The drunk we saw? I think so. Who else? He must have sunk slowly. There aren't too many dents in it. You're thinking about the dents? And the motor, and the time and the money. I think I'll sell it. It's only got 5,000 miles. A little polish and it'll be like new. How it's going? Fine. And you? How was the exchange this morning? A little better than yesterday. But this thing here's taken up all my time. They came asking if I owned the car, how it happened, license plate number and all that. - Am I taking up your time too? - No, I had to come this way anyway. Whereas I came to see you. What a fool. The pianist is good. Who is he? I don't know. Must be an old-timer. She was born in Kenya. She's killed hippos and elephants. Shoot the balloon. Get your riﬂe. Be careful, huh? Good shot! You see that? See how good she is? - Very good. Don't go home yet. When we get there, I'm going to kiss you. We're halfway. I'm going. Yeah. Hold on. Yes. Okay, bye. Hello? You're already here. I've been here 15 minutes. - I thought I'd be early. - But I got here first. - How are you? - Fine. I bought a new car. A BMW. What do you want to do? Shall we go someplace? Let's go someplace. - My place? - Your place. What a great face. You mind telling me what's wrong? Nothing. Let's walk a bit. You want to sit right there? - What's that? - It's just always been there. You live here? Not always, but I was born here. And when you're not here, where are you? I have another place. Much smaller. A pied-à-terre. Why didn't you take me there? Because - You want some? Would you like a chocolate? Pathetic! Serves you right. That'll teach you to treat me like some visitor. Come here. What did you do last night? I had dinner with seven or eight billion lira. Or was it a call girl? Who has time to go out with call girls? I'm the call girl. Do your parents always live in the dark? And what did you do last night? Why do we ask so many questions? Two people shouldn't know each other too well if they want to fall in love. But then maybe they shouldn't fall in love at all. Anyway, I had a good time. I was with some charming people. Do I know them? I don't think so. They don't play the market. You don't like to come to the exchange. I still can't figure out if it's an office, a market place, or a boxing ring. And maybe I don't even need to. You have to come often to understand it. If you get involved, it becomes a passion. A passion for what, Piero? Forgive me. I'm sorry. If clothes tear, it's their own fault. Vittoria, may I come in? No, you can't come in. I feel like I'm in a foreign country. Funny. That's how I feel around you. Then you wouldn't marry me? I don't miss marriage. How could you miss it if you've never been married? That's not what I meant. Then I really don't understand you. I wonder if your ex-fiancé did. As long as we were in love, we understood each other. There was nothing to understand. Tell me something. Do you think we'd get along? I don't know, Piero. That's all you know how to say. “I don't know.” So why come with me then? And don't tell me you don't know! I wish I didn't love you or that I loved you much more. There's always one too many arms. Leave it here. Now it's your arm. - Wait. - No, leave it there. I like it. You remember that couple we saw the other day on the bench? How was it? Wait. The two looking at each other were ever funnier. I remember another couple. Which one? It's late. For your sake, not mine. We'll see each other tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. And the day after that, and the next. And the day after that. And tonight. 8:00... the usual place. NUCLEAR ARMS RACE A FRAGILE PEACE
