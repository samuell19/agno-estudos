Bitches... Fucking Lech from Poznan. Mom, we beat 'em 5 to 1, here's dad. We'll be home after 6:00, bye. Fucking old whore. Legia's a fucking old whore, fuck Legia! 4 YEARS LATER - Got a boyfriend? - No. - Expecting someone? - No. Do you know them? No, fuck them. The guards are fucking you over. It's break-in and theft. Fuck! What the...? Oh fuck... You broke my fucking window? You'll replace it, asshole. I'm calling the cops. Shut the fuck up. You're not calling anywhere. And tomorrow you get her a new window, bring me 1000 ...and flowers. If not, I'll fucking find you. You scared the fuck out of me. As long as your prints aren't on the dope you can say a passenger left it. - What do you want? - 2 grams of hash. - Fuckin' gangsta. - What? Speed dealer they showed us this morning. Gangsta. Hey, numnuts. Stop, police! Central Police Headquarters Psychology Unit He yelled, "I'll kill you, prick!" and stabbed me. What did you feel? The first time on the job someone called me a prick I got a bit offended, but now... I got home, looked in the mirror, saw I don't look like a prick, so I don't get offended anymore. If they'd found drugs in your blood, you'd do time. They didn't. They check only for alcohol. For two years you were undercover in a drug ring. Trying to tell me that didn't break you? I've asked to the chief to transfer you out of narcotics. To where? To life and health. Mokotow. District Police Headquarters ll Mokotow District You must catch only petty criminals. And the big ones? Holy smoke, you can't catch them. Why not, chief? What are we going to do if you wipe out crime? Minnows count as much as big fish, and are easier to find. Stats don't differentiate. Like in a western. A stagecoach circled by Indians beating the shit out of a guy. Looks like they're using gas guns. - Police! Stop or I'll shoot. - Fuck you, go ahead and shoot. [Dug]? Get down! What's going on? Gentlemen... I have grievances with only him, him, and him, who were beating me, but not the others. What's this all about? Are you gentlemen? Ever seen a gentleman cop? If you piss me off, I'll let them finish the job. Talk! I was once deputy chief of the municipal guard. Someone sent my boss intimate photos of me. I wasn't with a woman, but a man, giving each other a blowjob. That was not tolerated, so I was ordered to resign. I did have a pro-male orientation once, but now I fuck only women. The gents who were beating me are from my male period. I said once that one of them sucked my dick. He got angry, went to the others, and said I was lying. They came to me and told me to take it back. I looked at them. Those yelling the loudest were: he gave me a blowjob 30 times, and him I fucked in the ass 15 times. Basically, I've had fun with all of them. That's what we do. So I said to him, "You sucked my dick, I fucked you in the ass. Where's the lie? They pulled out their pistols, I pulled out mine, and we began shooting. I fucked you in the ass, you gave me a blowjob. Which one did you fuck in the ass? Him, him, him, and him. Which one sucked your dick? Him, him, and him. 00 to 39. We picked up the thieves. Go see the woman who bought the hot stereo from them. Not only did the pricks fuck up the remodeling... Hang on. Hello? Police, please let us in. Don't bullshit me, or I'll call the real police. Nothing, fuckin' kids pretending to be cops so they can smoke in the stairwell... Hang on. What now? Please open the door, or we'll smash it open. Oh fuck, Anka, I think it really is the cops. Hang on. I could glue in a shitty picture like that myself. Did you buy a stereo? So, cops go round now doing marketing surveys? The stereo is stolen property. What?! Hello. Did your partner call you 'cause he's afraid to be alone with me? Yeah. God, what handsome men are on the force these days. How about some wine? On duty? You can always go off duty. Write straight. Hello. Two guys dressed as police officers just stole my stereo. Anka, the cops took my stereo. The one I bought from the workers. There's going to be a shootout, fuck me. Stop, police. I'm a cop, too. 040, 221 on the scene. They're ours. One of them was so tasty. Really hot. Turn on the siren. Officer Dariusz Wolkowski, ID and vehicle registration. I don't have them. We'll go to the station and the car will be towed away. I'll tell you what we'll do, kid. I have a meeting at 8:00 o'clock. Call this guy. At this number. Tell him Tomek said to call. Granny. You need the registration ASAP. He brings the papers, and I give you a big tip, deal? What's the tip? Soon things'll be put in order in Mokotow. There'll be a murder, and I'm going to be involved. I'm telling you this only because you'll never prove it. What the fuck good is that tip if I can't prove you did it? Olek! Sit up. Sit up. Sit up, goddamit! Olek, stop fooling around. Want some help? I'll be home late. Got a meeting of the board. Hi, dad. Marcin how much test are you doing now? Dude, I've never taken steroids. I give you the shots. Oh yeah. Thirteen gangsters, practically the whole group. Who's the boss here? Who the fuck is asking? Who's second in command? Mokotow is mine. You can work for me or get the fuck out. What's wrong with him? He faints at the sight of blood. We use him because he's big. Is that why he's called "Fear?" No, he was fucked up once and walked like this. Good, I don't have pussies on my team. Everyone must be trained so he never turns state's evidence. What do we do now? Call the cops. What were you doing when the shooting started? Working my quads. What'd you see? A football game. Who were the teams? How many guys on a team? Eleven With the goalie or without? Without. Know what, Marcin Opalka? Get the fuck on home. Can I finish my training? Are you the boss of the anti-terror unit? Mostowski Palace Central Police Headquarters I'm new here in Mokotow. I know Tomasz Barbasiewicz, alias "Granny", could've killed the dude in the gym. Protection racket gangsters train there. I think Granny's taken over their turf. I've got only green tea. I'll put it this way. I suspect you know a lot more about this group, and extortion of shopkeepers isn't your level, so... If you could help by telling me who else to pressure, then... I've got a proposal. I'll find out which gym they move to and I'll give you their phones and car keys for an hour. How'll you do that? I'll steal them from their lockers. I'll have a magic button to pressure them with. You'll have phone numbers and emails. You'll have the keys so you can search them, install GPS tracking. Install a wiretap, whatever. Sugar? No. - Does your boss know you're here? - Yeah. I have to write up a report that I talked to you. You know that, don't you? Go ahead, I've got nothing to hide. Can't I be here? Yeah, but it's not like in your unit; we have to make sure there are no leaks. Listen, your proposition... is very interesting, but it doesn't interest us. But I've got one for you. I mean I'll reveal a certain secret. Come here. Two guys help run the gang. Alias "Fear." Has a legal driving license as Marcin Opalka. And alias "Soup." Has a legal driving license as Oskar Nieklanski. Write those down. But only we know about it. And you. So, if it gets out, I'll know who sold us out. I've told you this, kid, because I feel I can really trust you. Here's my proposal If you catch these bandits, I have a magic telephone here. Opalka Marcin, father's name Zdzislawa, write it in. Alias " Fear?" Type in Nieklonski Oskar. Alias "Soup?" - Who has access to this? - Even the beat cops. What a prick. So, all of Poland knows a secret shared only by me and Green Tea? And? Balls. He treated me like a punk kid. Ok, we'll catch these gangsters and stick it up Mr. Green Tea's ass. Headquarters has the gangster's files. We won't show them in the system. We know everything, they know zip. So, when does the gangster's data get into the system? When we and the SWATs are breaking down the door. Thank you. Have some more cereal. I don't want any, Mom. Hi. Are you here every day? What the fuck are you looking at? No protection, so get the fuck out. Show up tomorrow, and I'll kill you. Hey, gramps. How much do you make a day? 40 zlotys. Here, now fuck off. Come help me kill the bitch - What bitch? - I got shoes that are too small. I've told the bitch so many times to give me my size, but she fucking gave me shoes too small. Are you nuts, you fucking slut? How many fucking times have I told you? How often do I have to fucking explain, you slut? - What's your problem? - Balls, that's my problem. You gave me a good one and one that's too fucking small. Are you fucking nuts? You fucking slut. Fuck! Fuck. Life. That's everyone on the street. Everyone doing business in Mokotow has to pay. - Give it to him. - Why? He's got a mother to support. My family's rich. - Why the fuck are you doing this? - Fame. - I might just have some fish. - Fear, here's some Cytomel T3. Where's the pro-tren? Hang on. What is it? There's a bunch of guys in the stairwell dragging in kids and stealing their allowance. Did you let them steal yours? Are you a fucking fag? Like being fucked? Are you a faggot? No. Where? Doors? Stay here. Next time I'll fuck you over. Tell mom I'll be home late, ok? Police. What are you doing here? At a girlfriend's party. - And you? - Me too. So you aren't prostitutes and this isn't a brothel? No. - That's very good. - Why? You see, I really can't stand whores. Were we supposed to fuck the whores or the clients? Everyone. Do you like your work? Then grab something and smash the bar. Your boss won't do anything. Clients treat you well? Would you like to kill one of them? I'll bet it'll take you only five minutes. What for? What happens will be our little secret. They'll get blamed for it all. Just imagine that for the next five minutes you can do whatever you want to this schmuck. I'd really like to fuck you. I'm sorry, but it turned me on. Give me the belt; we have to destroy it. Will you tell me your name? Hen. Satisfied that we visited, whores? - Satisfied that we visited? - Yes. - I can't hear you. - Yes. What do you say? Please come again. This is Tomek. He can help. I've heard you've got problems with thugs. You need protection. They can't keep doing this. Security with rne costs 50,000, but I guarantee no one will come here. Good morning, police. Does anyone come here for protection money? - How many stands do you have? - Eleven. - Anyone shaking you down? - I don't know a thing. All sorts of shit happens here. Go fucking look somewhere else. Those that pay are too scared. We have to find people that the gang hasn't gotten to yet. I need a thousand business cards with my name and phone number. If anyone tries to shake you down, don't call the police, call me. Hello. Boss in? She'll be here tomorrow. I'm out of business cards. Tell her to call me if they come for money. - Hello. - Hello, we're here to see Darek. We've got lots of Dareks. A real hunk with shit in his head. Please wait, ladies. Miami, two bimbos to see you. Excuse us... I'm hitting on him. If he turns me down, he's got a girl or he's queer. You took care of the stereo, so I thought you'd do something else. What else? Lend me a pen. Nice ink. Tattoos mean a lot. I've got a mosquito. Where? On my butt. - Why a mosquito? - I like getting bitten. Got any paper clips? Office supplies are at fucking headquarters. 796076303 Where're you from? I'm having a cookout. And I've got the kids in Anka's car. Maybe you could drive yours and give us a ride home. Sorry. Yeah? Hi. You were at my beauty parlor. You left this number. What's up? If any boys from Mokotow show up with an offer you can't refuse, I'd like to get together and talk about it. Aha... I'm out of town right now, but we can meet when I get back. Where are you from? From Mokotow. - Who in Mokotow sent you? - What do you mean, sent me? Who in Mokotow? Where in Mokotow? What the fuck do you mean where? From the Mokotow police station. Ok, later. You just missed them. The faggots were here. I told my husband not to pay. But he said the cops won't help. He got in touch with the beat cop, who told him he can't work miracles. The bastards found out that Maho runs money from other businesses through here, and they jacked up his payment. Mah0's a Turk so he called round. A friend's going to collect it all so it's cheaper. If I talk to the cops, he and his friends will be fucked. Can we do this? I'll pretend to go along and pay them, then give you their numbers and help put them in jail. One thing. If I help, you guarantee you'll put them behind bars. - I'll do all I can. - Not enough. I have a kid. I don't want to help you if later on they find out, and you end up digging up my husband and me. I don't want you to find the person who killed me. That'll be obvious when they find out I helped you. I want you to put them away so we can live in peace. All right, I promise. - Hello. - It's about that store on Bartycka. I've noticed a grey Opel there. A gal and some guy are hanging around, so watch out for them. All right, thanks Stasiu. I want to open a paint store, and I know I'll have to pay you, so I'm calling first. How about letting me pay less and on better terms, ok? One telephone's given us 237 victims and 31 gangsters. Can I talk to Marcin? He collects the cash from me, - and there's a problem. - Hang on. - What's up? -Hi, honey, I'm calling from Wrobel, the cafe you collect from. We've got a problem. They're following my ex. I'm calling from a booth, I might have a tail. They might be observing the cafe and my phone might be tapped. So if you want to come for the cash, we have to use someone. So you don't get caught and so nothing happens to you. I don't pay protection money to anyone. "I'm calling from a booth, I might have a tail..." "They might be observing the cafe and my phone might be tapped..." And whose fucking voice is that? Bandits are taking your money, and you even help them? If you want to lock me up, then do it. If not, I'm not telling you anything and I'm going home. Operational Technology Unit Classic Stockholm syndrome, bonding with their captors. We're setting an ambush and we'd like to borrow something nifty. Fuck me, we've got a nanny. Am we supposed to talk about kids? Here's the camera. Look, look. Where do you turn it on, here? Here, and there's a lamp, look. Press it. I want to be filmed. Ok wait, we're rolling. Tonight should be relatively fantastic. Darek, I already have a nanny. - Maybe you'll read them a story? - Want me to? - Sure we do. - Oh great. Then read Pan Tadeusz, because it'll be a while. Now you'll wait. Light it for me? Don't you you know how? It tastes better, don't you know? Ganja you're a fine mama. Know what? I feel as if I've known you for ten years. Yeah? Yeah. What time is it? Eight. - How're doing, souse? -Fuck me. Olka take me to work. The operation at the kebab! I have to deliver the equipment. The equipment went long ago. Sleep, baby, sleep. You had 15 unanswered calls. I even showed them how to use it. You're kidding, right? If they come to me, I'll cut off their dicks and stuff them in their mouths. Yes? I was to tell something to the boys in the back. Oh fuck! Maho, put it down; he's a cop. Excuse me, sorry, I'm sorry. You realize that another minute and you would've been dead? - What'd you say to him? - I had something to tell the boys. Maho, what'd you think he said? He was from the boys, and I had to give him something. I thought he was a bandit, so I wanted to cut his head off. I'm very sorry. Want a kebab? The cops have an ambush at the kebab, so watch out. District Police Station Ursynow District Nina, stop pole dancing, all right? - Why, can't I? - No. All right, stop already. Come on, Nina. A vendor reports there's an ambush at the kebab place. Nice, huh? Hello. We got a report that thugs were demanding extortion money. Son, who the fuck sent you here? - The dispatcher. - The dispatcher? Two patrol cars fucking showed up at my ambush. How the fuck did they know? A unit out of Ursynow had the information. I came from officer Olgierd Knyg alias "Gendarme." Give me his phone number.. And something to write with. Get these cars out of here. All of Mokotow knows we're here. - Talk to me. - Miami from Mokotow. Where'd you get information that the kebab owner was being extorted? Not from me, it's my partner Gendarme's phone. He said he saw thugs there. Well, champ, how'd he know the owner was being extorted? It wasn't me. Ask Gendarme. He's got his own information. Tell Gendarme that if he fucks up my operation again, he'll regret it. Central Police Headquarters Internal Affairs Division I recorded a cop from Ursynow when monitoring the Mokotow gang. - Gendarme, lift four cop uniforms. - Send me the sizes. Thank you very much for the information. That's all? Listen... We'll use this. It's another piece of evidence. Soon there'll be effects. All right. Hi, we've got the red car. We'll plant a phone and follow her, so drive slowly around Ursynow. I'll call all units in for donuts at the BP, and you can move. He says they're observing a bitch in a red car at the station on the corner of Pulawska and Ursynowska. And he said he'd give them a clear ride through Ursynow. All right. Gas station on the corner of Pulawska and Ursynowska. Anything fast tanked up here in the last 15 minutes? - A red car? - A girl in an orange Cayenne does. 39200 to 39208. - O8, Come in, 00. -Check the owner of a Porsche, tag number WO04806. Police. Is the Cayenne WO04806 registered to you? - Yeah, to me. - Who drives it? - My daughter. - Call her. Why? Call or they'll kill her. Hello... Hello, miss. Please turn off the engine. License and registration. Please come with me to the patrol car. Hello. Hello. I don't have any points and I've never gotten a ticket. I know I shouldn't have used the phone. Excuse me. - My dad keeps calling. - He loves you, huh? Yes. Then write, "Daddy, I've been kidnapped. They'll send you a finger that they cut off. If you don't pay a million Euros, they'll kill me." Daddy: lwonka, drive off! Pretty. If you've called the cops, we'll kill her. I haven't called anywhere. I'm on the viaduct. Now what? Go the barrier and toss the bag down on the grass. I've thrown it. When will you release my daughter? Hello? Hello. Hello. Your daddy paid. We underestimated you. Are you studying anything? Sociology. - What are doing? - A manicure. Don't worry about the finger. You're very pretty. I'd fuck you, but I've got a girl. We don't have time for recon; we take him now. Police, open up! We're breaking down the door, get on the floor! Police, on the ground! Why the fuck are we sent in with kids here?! It's all right. Are you hurt? - My name's Jacek. You? - Jasiek. And you? Nina. Where are you from? Palace headquarters. What kind of palace? Not the one from Snow White. - Where are your parents? - Their operation ran long. You really scared us. I'm sorry. You haven't done anything wrong, but your brother has. We're looking for him. He has to tell us something. Do you know when he'll be back? He moved in with Hen yesterday. - I see, with a hen. - Hen's his girlfriend. Soup knows you went to the police. I think the safest option is to starve him. From wiretaps I know where he is, - but without your testimony, I won't put him away. -What about the other gangsters? We don't have any protection programs, but I'll have a team posted here 24/7. I know if you testify, others will be willing. We're supporting traffic; all phones stay in your rooms. Come to the briefing dressed, with a shortwave and a balaclava After the briefing we get in our cars and leave. I apologize to you all. I had to keep it a secret, but we're not working with traffic. The Mokotow gang? Soup. The gang's always a step ahead of us; they've got a mole inside. No phones. I don't want anyone texting Soup that we're on our way. After which he splits or hides goods that shouldn't be there. We don't know who we'll find. Wear balaclavas, shots may be fired. If you have to shoot at gangsters better they not know who you are. Central Police Headquarters Operations Unit Second, don't use the radio. We've got it set to monitor only. Soup's got a police scanner. We'll drive down Wilanowska until you hear me say "turn." Soczek, Budyn, Bergus, and I drive up in unmarked cars and park near the gate. Pretending to be drunk, we approach the janitor's cubby. We know that Soup's got the janitor on the payroll. He gave him 500 and told him to let him know if he sees cops, so we definitely put the janitors on the ground. I'll raise the barrier so the SWAT boys can drive in. Police! Move away from the blinds. Step aside! The second unit is blocked at the window by security shutters made of rubber. Police, open the door! - All right, I'm opening it. - Then fucking open it now! - You've damaged the lock. - Move you hand. Go ahead, press. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. Gas! Police, police, police! This is the terror of Mokotow? Hi, Oskar. I expected this. From me? From you the most, Darek. Oskar, how do you know my name? We've never laid eyes on each other. Everyone knows you're a secret agent, who hates Mokotow. Take him away. Soup's a vodka collector. We'll party later. No drinking now. About two kilos of gold. And a police scanner. But it's set for Piaseczno. I don't know why it isn't set for Mokotow. We'll check the garage. All right, and rip up the paving bricks. - No weapons or narcotics, but... - He dumped the goods. Soup bought a furnished apartment, and spent three days redoing it. He's got mirrors, drywall around the tub, and shelves. I'll admit I'm itching to do some digging here. The son of a bitch furnished his flat with extortion money. Miami, you can demolish it, but you've got one assignment. What's that? - Don't tear down the building. - Ok, thanks. Here we go. Daren! The corner's chipped. As if the glass has been taken out and put back. Different names on the IDs. Nothing in the garage. Hello. Quiet! The janitor says Soup's bitch broke the seals, went into his apartment, and left the garage carrying a bag. - Did you check the baby seat? - Check how? Did you cut it open? It's empty, and you can hide stuff inside. No, I didn't. Fuck, she cut out the bottom. I said to search everything. What the fuck is this? Hi, why haven't you called? Know what, Olga? I don't think we're a good match. Darek. You can't tell me on the phone that we're not a good match. How can a man not be a match for a woman? Two halves of an orange. What do you want? This is important. Don't you fucking believe in destiny? Where do you get your money? Rich parents and child support. From a gangsta from Ozarow. Are you fucking interrogating me? When I checked your record the printer ran out of paper. And? I don't have anything to do with that now. Don't you have a past? - So? - So. Fuck, Darek, we're made for each other. Can't you see that? You love kids, I've got 'em. You want to be a dad, I need one. And the sex was fucking great. It's destiny. I could've bought something else. Someone else could've come to me. I love you. Maybe you don't love me yet, but when we get to know each other. You'll see how I wake up. How I sit on the toilet. I'll see which hand you eat with. If we have to change the door handles. - You smoke dope, and I don't. - Then I don't either. - Olka I find a new piece of ass every week. -But they - don't make you sandwiches for lunch. - Yes, they do. - But not with cucumber. - Fuck. Password. Police, freeze! On the ground. Fuck me. A 120 meter flat, and he shows up with a backpack. I'll make you some space in the shoe cabinet. Hi. - You remembered. - You bet. I've been listening to Soup since September. How'd you get his new address? Wiretap. On a phone starting with 507? 603. Know why I treated you like a nerd? We're working the same gang. You extortioon, and I... those who cut off fingers. They kidnapped 41 people in Warsaw. All had fingers cut off. Sent to their families for ransom. A university student. The daughter of Joreno the sausage man. A Pakistani flush with dough. Alias "Pig?" Yeah pig, dirty business, dirty hands. The Mokotow gang kidnapped all 41. They let 34 go, after the families paid, of course. I found the hole they were kept in after logging on with Soup's phone. Unfortunately, it was empty. I can't find seven people. If you hadn't treated me like shit, maybe you wouldn't be looking. You didn't have to say that. But, 0k, I've got a proposition. You do your wiretaps, I do mine. If something important for either of us comes up, we exchange information. Ok? OK. Maho, someone's at the door! - What is it? - Security, your car's alarm is on. Hello? Are you a policeman? Yes. Who's calling? My mom's dead. She isn't moving. I think my dad is, too. He's in the bathroom and doesn't answer. Are you calling from the flat on Pulawska? Your mama is Andzia and daddy Maho? I'll be right there to get you. Just promise that you'll wait and won't call anyone else, ok? I promise. You left the child inside. The security camera recording. That was the last time the girl was seen. You lost a witness. You won't put Soup away for long for fake IDs. We'll tack on the fingers, but his lawyer will get him out before we have all the evidence. Hello? All right. I'll try pressuring Soup's bitch. You do what you can, too. Let's go. Are you fucking nuts? Your brain's fried. You sleep with a gangster. You're faithful to him. And he's cheating on you. He treats you like a cunt. You'd like that, huh? Hen won't be jealous, the coed just sucked my dick. Like jacking off using her head. He's fallen in love with a student, who he kidnapped himself. Eight years younger than you. Still want to keep lying. And covering? Zdzisiu give me 50 for the fine. No fines today. Pack up and get the fuck out. You've got half an hour. Then we seize your goods and arrest you. It's worth 40,000. If I don't sell it, it'll rot. If you don't let me work the weekend, I'll lose all that money. What's more, I'll lose liquidity and my business will be fucked. Remember when I told you it's better to be on our side than that of the bandits? I asked you three times. No more. I can't, I've got a wife and kids. - They'll fucking kill me. - We're police, not Boy Scouts. You've got two choices. Talk, and I lock up them up. Or you don't and stay a source of income for them, so you have to be eliminated. If this is illegal, it's fucking over. I will fucking finish you. - Don't finish me, don't. - I'll kill you with the guards. Man, I've already dug my grave. Ever dug your own grave? Listen to me. As long as I'm on the force, you won't be harmed. - Hey, tourist, where you going'? - Fuck you. - Back to the resort, queer. - Queer? I'll fucking kill you! - I'll fucking kill you. - When you get out in 2041. - I didn't hear him threaten you. - Are you a member of the bar? - Go fuck yourself. - Excuse me? What's up? The boss of Mokotow. Take out your lightning stick and pump him full of lead. Don't say anything. Toss me the mooring line. Thanks. MIAMl'S A PRICK - Yeah? - It's me, they've grabbed me. Fuck, Zdzisiek, where? - I'm going downtown. - Where'd you get the phone? I had a second one hidden on me and they didn't find it. How do you know where you're going'? - Because they told me. - The fucking gangstas told you? No, the municipal guard. Fuck, Zdzislaw, you want me to have a fucking hear attack? Are you fucking stupid? What station are they taking you to? Word's out that Zdzisiek has talked. They'll try getting revenge. Barszczyk is fucked as protection. I wrote to the police station where Zdzisiek lives. I explained the situation and asked them to put him on surveillance 24/7. They said that area isn't even covered by normal patrols. If someone calls the police, they come in an hour. I don't want a repeat of Ania. I have a buddy who lives in the woods. The police chief in Wegrow. 3O kilometers from there. Local Headquarters Wegrow Police Department I've read your email. I know about the Mokotow gang. Where that guy lives also live two of my officers. One's a neighborhood cop, but the other's from criminal. I'll order both to take their weapons home with them. Pick the one you want. That one. Wrong. Look. Take this one. His name's Luger. There are three training stages. First he tears up a rabbit. Two months later a goose. Finally a sheep.. The sheep's the toughest, but a goose flaps those wings, and also hard to kill. You'll see how he hates animals. When he kills the rabbit he sits on him, and you can't take it from him. Why not? He'll be disappointed. It's his prey. He can share it with you as a friend, but it's his. You'll see what an instinct he has in four weeks. I don't think I'll train him. Hi? Miami, the whole street's dark, and some car's parked outside. Hang on. Can't you tell them you're asleep at this hour? How can I tell them I'm asleep when I answered the phone? Hi, what is it? My man says the lights are out and a car's parked outside his house. All right, give me a minute. My neighbour's got a gun; he's running at them in his fucking pajamas. Understand? Pajamas, rubber boots, shotgun, and fucking running to them. I've never seen anything like it. - What the fuck? - Stop, police! They're fucking driving away. They smacked into a tree. Smashed half the fucking car. Chief, they cut the power line, that's why there were no lights. Fear, I'm Zbyszek from Plonsk. I'm asking for a franchise. A sucker from Plonsk owes us money. We'd like to pay him a visit as the Mokotow gang. He'll shit his pants. Half of what I get is yours. Deal? - Are you hereto see the healer? - Yeah. We're not going to wait. We have to crash the line. People will start yelling. The shaman will get all pissed off. Dad, I think I feel a tingling. - I have to use a bedpan. - All right, just a minute. Come on. Help me take him to the field. We're in line here. Hello. Kazek here. Some fucking guy named Zbigniew is here claiming to be from Plonsk and the Mokotow gang. I don't know the fuckers. Fuck them over. Look at all the peaches you have to ruin to get one pack of almonds. Those aren't almonds. They grow on almond trees. So if it's a sandalwood tree, do sandals grow on it? Are Zbigniew and Zbyszek the same name? A Zbyszek came for a franchise today. - Now they called about a Zbigniew. - The same. Hey, Kazyk, I fucked up the names. Zbigniew is ok. Yeah, but he's all busted up already. Fuck it! Tell him it was a misunderstanding. Not every guy with a pitchfork is Zeus. Or fucking Neptune. Hello. My son's here to be healed. I won't help you; you live off harming others. You can go in. Fuck me, did you hear her? What the fuck was that? Should I burn her? Send a construction crew over and have them build a little chapel by her house. And get 50 boys together; we're going to a game in Poznan. There is one thing that we all know! The thing that counts in life is yo! Lech from Poznan, blue and white! You fuck. Not in the head or he'll stop talking. Name of the punk who hit the kid in the train? I don't know. His name? Not in the head. I can't look at blood, so I'm swinging blind. It's fucking hard to aim. - Let someone else do it. - Wait. I'll cut him down. I'll stand on his head. Then I'll be sure I'm beating him, not just bashing his head. All right. Wait. What? Gentlemen. Understand... if I talk, they'll kill me. And I'll be a sucker for the rest of my life. Well, boys, what do you say? A little fucking respect, huh? We've wailed on him for an hour, and he hasn't broken. We'll leave him here and get the fuck back to Warsaw. There's a road a kilometer from here. Think he made it? What'd you say? He made 30 centimeters in an hour. But in the wrong direction. Grab him. You've got a bus at 18:20. Somebody will notice you. MOm? Mom! MOm? The business trip to Poznan was a massacre. I couldn't reach you. The meeting ran long. I found your company on the Internet. Nobody's ever seen you there. - Homework done, Olek? - Of course. - Not lying? - No way. First I'll work your legs then your arms and torso. I'm out of the can. Did you work on my turf? You'll get the fuck out of my area, and give back all you made. Didn't you get newspapers? Never heard of the Mokotow gang? So what? Want to fight with me? Want to shoot it out with me? And scare me with what? Who cares about the Mokotow gang? I'm from Chechnya. You can't scare me. That's all I have to tell you. Shall I look for a new therapist? He attacked me. I'll take him to the hospital. Wait, you fuckers! Prior to prison Salman owed money to a group in Pomerania. They've kidnapped him and are demanding 100,000 euros. If Salman's Chechnya boys handle it, we'll never get him. Can you get your hands on that kind of money? I'm sorry. We're on the viaduct. What do we do? All right, we'll throw it. Toss it. Toss it. Everything will be fine. My wife wants a divorce. But there's good news. I met a nice piece of ass. She's got a kid. But fuck it. I can adopt it. Just so we get hitched. There's more. I'll take her husband's name. That goat fucker from the hills. - They'll have to fish him out. - I'll fucking kill you. Shame to waste good wire. A showdown with the goat-fuckers at 4:00 p.m. at the Field. We're attracting them by calling for "Salman's turds" to show up. We'll have it outwith them. Come pick up the weapons. In an hour there's going to be a shootout with the Chechens. Listen. Relations have changed a bit. Mokotow Field is actually in the Ochota district. Why don't we let them handle it? Regional Police Headquarters Ill Ochota, Ursus, Wlochy A showdown with the goat-fuckers at 4:00 p.m. at the Field. All right, I'll call the SWAT boys. There's going to be a shootout at Mokotow Field in 30 minutes. Can you make it? What? I see. All right, bye. SWAT can't make it. They've got an operation going on, and the second shift is just coming on. Sir, I've got a direct line to the anti-terror unit. I'll call and they'll be there. The chief won't let us use them. We have our own operational unit. Sir, human lives are at stake. There could be innocent victims. All right, I'll send three patrol cars. They'll drive around and maybe scare them off. Is this how you fucking catch bandits? Police! On the ground! Get down! Lie down, you fuck, and eyes on me! On the ground! Down! Look at me. Look at me. Lie still, head down. Guys, I'm a policeman. Lie fucking still. What are you doing with these thugs, you fucking scumbag? A while ago you were pumped, and now what, you fuck? You piece of shit. Are you a cop? Decide! Either you're a cop, or you're a fucking gangster. I'll tell you everything. I'll tell you what the gang's done and what their plans are. I want to cop a plea; talk to the prosecutor. - The venal cop's copping a plea? - Yeah. Will he give us enough to jail Fear? Yeah, but I don't know where fear is. I've got him located. Thanks to a big mouth pitbull breeder. But I don't have evidence to go to trial. I'd like you to nail him. I'll set him up for you, and you arrest him on what you've got. Later I'll add our charges. Once he's in the can. Call your dog off. Call the dog off or I'll call the police. What fucking police? What police?! He's a normal fucking dog. What kind of fur is it? - Rabbit. -Police! On the ground! On the ground! Look at me! What the fuck is this? That's my own money. Wanted to pick up the payments yourself? Could you take, your boot off my face? Geez, don't cry. Now you're crying? A minute ago you were a hero. Show me where your balls are. Come on, where are your balls? Jump on a cop. Like you do people at the bazaar. Cuff him. Officer... How about a tangerine or banana? Here you are, sir. Enjoy! My hands are softer than Paddington Bear's. As if I hadn't worked a day in my life. - Know what's the funniest? - What? You can't imagine the information I've gotten. The hairdressers and manicurists know more than any informant. I know everything that's going on at the bazaar. How's it going, Batman? Smile. In a bad mood or just naturally shy? Martin. You don't want to do time. Then give me something. Become an informer. Redeem yourself. I don't talk to cops. Martin. Turn state's evidence. I won't say a thing. Man, the time of loyalty is over. Think your friends are loyal? I'm not talking. Today I arrested this guy, who asked to turn state's evidence while he was still on the ground. - What the fuck? - What the fuck are you doing? Fucking with us? - What time is it? - 5:00 o'clock. Time's flying and court's waiting, Marcin. All right, I'll turn state's evidence. Don't bullshit us, ok? I'll tell you everything just take me the fuck down and give me something to eat. You have to sing for your supper. - This ain't no game. - I take insulin and growth hormone. If I don't eat something soon, I'll go into a coma and we won't talk at all. Fuck! Take him down. Want a sandwich? Where are the seven people with their fingers cut off? So that's what I was snagging my hook on. You're not a gangster! You're a pussy and a sucker. You're not a gangster! You're a pussy and a sucker. You're not a gangster! You're a pussy and a sucker. Get up, your ride's here. Fear, you know that with a conviction for murder you can't turn state's evidence? Oh yeah. Then why the fuck did you give statements that fucked your father and brother for some old shit they did? For me things are black or white. If I redeem myself, it's total. They killed your mother in revenge. You won't have anyone to visit you on Christmas in prison. But thanks to that, the prosecutor promised me only 15 years for killing the Chechen. Martin. Don't be so gullible. After all for burying those seven corpses with missing fingers you'll get three life sentences. I understand, but for the Chechen the prosecutor promised me only 15. I've heard you're a cop who can't be bought. I don't like bandits either. I run a small store and they said I have to pay protection. Is there room to hide a couple of guys for an ambush? No, but next door were gambling machines, now it's empty. Sir, I've got a few thousand victims I must keep in touch with. I requested two phones, one for the investigative officer and one for me. The investigator got one and I didn't. Holy smoke, there wasn't a phone for you. There was only one. One's enough for you. That's life. Go to the "Blue" detective agency, on Niepodleglosci Ave. Hi, sit down. Something to drink? Too early for vodka, huh? Coffee, black, right? Here. Our security agency decided to sponsor a phone for you. We know what you're working on. We're all cops here. Don't get so teared up. They'll write it off, and won't give a shit about you. Unless you start calling abroad. How's the Mokotow gang? Nailed a couple. They've done so much it would take years to do the full boat. So I'm breaking it down into smaller cases. I jail them for small shit, then find other crimes and get their sentences extended. Clever boy. If you ever want to work here instead of downtown, then call. There's no toilet, so no craps, and we piss in the sink. I put it high, so it might look like you're fucking the wall. Some smoke, some don't, so we don't overdo it, ok? That Lech fan we fucked up with the baseball bat is here. - So, he survived. - He's got something for you. The guy who clubbed your son. Thanks. - I feel sick. - Can you hold out? No. Someone just went in. Fucking wait. Hi, brother-in-law. Oh fuck, I can't believe it. When'd you move out? Long time ago. A guy who murdered, cut off fingers, comes to some rathole of a store to extort money? People tell me you've got a problem with gangsters. I figured I could help you. - I could use it. - All right, I'll talk to them. We'll be in touch. - Let's go. - No. He'll get away. Taking him now is easy. The trick is to catch him red-handed. Give Ewka my best. No free lunch. You have to give something. How much cash do you have? - A thousand - Let's have it. On the ground, Granny. Cuff him. Eyes on me. - What are you trying to do? - I knew it was you. Then why the fuck did you come instead of sending some flunky? But you're happy it's me, aren't you? Nobody fucking touches him. Want to bad mouth him? Go ahead. Anyone touches him will be fucking sorry. Because I say so. He sees me drifting with a woman and kids, jumps into the fucking lake and hauls in my boat... He at least deserves not to be fucked over by you guys. Prosecutor. All right, it's fucking 5:00 o'clock. You want to charge me with fucking extortion? You've got it all on tape, so let's make things easier. I'll admit to the extortion charge and get three years. In exchange you let me get married while I'm in prison. Soup's in jail. Granny's in jail. Who's going to collect the money? - I don't know. - Maybe you could? Me? I put mine aside every month. If you talk to Soup, tell him his money's waiting for him. What happened to you? What happened to me? Your brother's buddies did this. For blowing money that wasn't mine. A kid in the hood owes me money. I'd like to kill him. Yeah? You fucking snitch. You fingered us. You told them where Soup lived. The gang wants to make you pay. Make you pay, understand? I didn't sell anyone out. A police informer is coming here. He'll say if it was you or not. Let him come and look. Moron. You think he's going to want to talk to you? Face to face? We have to tie you to a chair and put on a blindfold. So the source thinks we're taking care of business here. Tie me up then. It's gone too far. He'll turn us in to the cops, and we'll do time for kidnapping or some such shit. We have to finish him off. Shhh. Pull. - Like this? - Yeah. He said he fucks you in the ass. He said he'll never give you back the money. He says you're a fag. The biggest sucker in the hood. Harder. You have to pull harder. Harder. The groom may kiss the bride. You married Granny? Yes. I picked up T0masz's car this morning. I'm here for the registration. Do you know what he did? People change. I'm talking about Salman. Then ask your husband what he did to your first husband. I've got your papers. - Want a ride home. - Yeah, right. Fuck, now what? Sir, is this the new operational car? Holy smoke, beautiful, isn't it? For operational work. You do realize, sir, that if you drive around in your uniform this car is useless? All the criminals will know it's a cop car. Thank you, goodbye. You fucking prick. Fuck you. Roll down the window. - What is it? - Go... and look at the camera in front of Tomasz's prison. And give him my love. Hold these. You're not going to fucking leave me with these, are you? He leaves with other prisoners to work on the outside somewhere. - How long? - Nine days. Does he pay you for it? Yeah, but nothing's going on. He always returns for the night. Fuck. Granny's car, which his wife picked up. Check the cameras around the prison and see which door he exited at 08:15. Kiss me. Stay in the car. He's not there. Oh fuck me... Game over. You don't have nine lives either. You think I can't kill a cop? That I'm finished if I do that? One thing. Did you kill that kid? Fuck off and start worrying about your own kids. We're not all that different. Yes we are. For me to kill you, you have to reach for your gun. I told you to wait. I didn't know what happened. I heard shots and I thought... Central Police Headquarters Internal Affairs Division Hello, my friend. Sit down. Someone called saying it was some sort of formality. I'm to sign something, so - give it to me, and I'll go. - Got your badge? - Yeah. - Let me have it. We've got you. What the fuck? You say you're my friend, and you act like this? Who the fuck are you? Give me that badge. - No. - Give it to me or I'll beat the fuck... - There are two of us. - Think I won't wipe the floor with both of you? Give me back the badge now. Here, you fucking has-been. You think I'm a schmuck who's going to cry. That I'll run away with my badge? - Fuck off friend. - Listen. You're suspected of violating discipline. You're going to be suspended. Better if you resign on your own. Then we'll drop the case. When you quit the police chief will get off your back. If not, we'll have to file charges. What charges? That you cruise around town in a new operational car in your uniform, and pick up young snatch. So it doesn't matter if I'm guilty. Just so I quit, huh? Then tell your boss that we're going to fight. He didn't put me on the force, and he isn't going to move me out. - Police. - What's this all about? What's going on here? Gebels, he's not here. Recognize me, boy? Why'd you fucking kill him, huh? Don't swear in front of me. Do you understand your situation now? Or shall I explain more? Why the fuck are you looking at me like that? Want to hit me back? Go ahead and try. Well? Still mad at me or think you deserved it? I guess I deserved it. Back to your cell, boy. If my father had whipped the fuck out of me... Don't talk dirty, don't swear. ...then I wouldn't be here today. Go ahead and kill me. I don't deserve to live. No, boy. We aren't going to kill you. Even if you want to kill yourself. We won't let you die. So you'll always remember. And so you know why you're in prison. Do you know what you did? Nothing. Then now you'll fucking see how pleasant it was for him. Fuck! No! No! Now do you know? If I suck the guard's dick, will I have it easier? Know how old he is? You want to suck an old geezer's dick? If it makes things easier for me. Charges against you weren't confirmed. But the police chief ordered you removed from the unit. You've been demoted to recovering property in Ursus. District Police Station Ursus District Report of stolen jars from a basement at 7 Pieciolinia Str. Hi Ola. Don't wait supper. I'm going on a call. Bye And? What the fuck do you mean, bye? Supper's burning. Come home soon.
