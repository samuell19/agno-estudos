LIKE THE WIND Inspired by a true story Sulmona Prison, April 18th 2003 That's all I've got. I'll do the shopping. See you tonight! Hi, Lea. Sweetheart! See you later. Come on! Sleep well? Where are we going? I'm going alone. Transform it, softly. Opera Prison, Milan, 1989 You're beautiful, Marie. As beautiful as sin. It's incredible a mortal sin could be so beautiful. You should bear a mark, but I see nothing. You're crazy, Franz. A sin so big should smell so foul it would drive the angels away. How did he do it? Like this or like this? I'd rather be stabbed than feel your hands on me. Men... are like bottomless pits. Looking at them makes us dizzy. Umberto, who's this helping? My son? He needs his father. Not for him to clown around, playacting in jail. Who's this helping? Me. Your colleagues, everyone who believes in us. If you don't believe in us, it's pointless. 5 minute break. It's very suggestive. That Canali has talent, but do you think "Woyzeck" was a wise choice? Why? It's about a man who kills the woman he loves through jealousy, madness. Isn't Canali in here for killing a prostitute? Yes. It's a bit risky. You should have done "The Tempest" by Shakespeare. We talked about it. In that, the vanquished win, but without violence. You're extra beautiful today. All right, back to work. The scene in which Woyzeck caresses Marie. - From the start? - Yes. Patience. We'll get a real actress in for the performance. Umberto, I'm going. Let's thank Ms Miserere. Thanks for letting me watch the rehearsal. You're outstanding. I'll be there for the first night. Goodbye. Goodbye, Governor. I love you. Likewise! Lodi Prison You're under pressure, but don't give in. We can't let them win. Governor, I'm giving you the facts. We're being threatened. It's hard to work under these conditions. You've been threatened personally? Have you a specific complaint? I visit the cells every day. I'm aware of the intimidation. It doesn't justify these favours. I'm not pointing at you, but someone did it. I don't care what the mob or anyone else says, we've a job to do. No more, no less. If, as a result of a search in my prison, this is found, it means something's wrong. Someone must have brought it in. You can go. We just received this. It's addressed to you. I'll have it opened if you like. Thank you. See you later. Another one... You'll always protect me, won't you? - Say it. - Always. Boss! Prof. Mormile. Hi, Sanzò. The guys in the flower workshop made this to thank you for the time that you give us. We're grateful for what you do. Give them to a pretty woman. It's lovely. Thanks. Who made it? A colleague in 27 and me. It's arums, camelias, Venus-hair and white lilies. Thanks. The arum symbolises refinement, camelia, gratitude. I don't know about Venus-hair, but lilies are fidelity. How do you remember all that? I've a good memory. You should try harder to remember your friends. I don't mean me, of course. Prof... in Parma, a friend helped you. A friend they won't allow to work outside, here. Sanzò, I can't do anything for Zigania. He has to ask the Governor of Parma. It's out of my hands. But thanks... Isn't it lovely? They even make flower garlands here. Lovely, eh? It's very appropriate. Why? Has something happened? Inside? Inside here. What's...? We're having a baby. - Is that it? - Yes. I'm pregnant. Stop, Umberto, you're scaring me. Are you happy? Stop! Stop! My God! You're pregnant! Everyone get ready and get out while they can! After 6 years, we herald the arrival of a dangerous cross-breed, a Mormile-Miserere. To this new creature! How do you imagine this cross-breed? I don't. A handsome sailor, intrepid, a show off, like my father, with a fine white sailor suit. And the name? Antonio for a boy, and for a girl, Luna. Pretty! But... He'll be a Communist, according to tradition. You know the Berlin Wall just came down? Communism's out of fashion. Poor thing... another dreamer. You've something against that? No, nothing at all. I'm a card-carrying dreamer, too. Me too, but... Is that for me? For the dreamer. It's beautiful! There might be another little thing. What is it? Hurry up! I feel awkward. Open it! It's a real one, I swear! An engagement ring! Morning sickness already in the 6th week... Answer it! I feel dreadful. Hello? Who is this? If you really loved me, you wouldn't lose my gifts. It's a bad sign. It's in some people's interest to put pressure on prisons. An investigation in another prison revealed links between terrorists and certain departments. Riccardo, I've never let myself be intimidated in Lodi. By anyone. But I won't hide the fact that just now, I'd like to feel... safe, better protected. Don't worry. We'll find out who sent the bullet. Maybe you should take a break. Spend some time at home. Let's take a look. What happened? A prisoner died. Which cell? Number 11. This can't go on! Bastards! Here. Sorry, Gardini's dead. We wanted the HIV-positive inmates transferred, but it never happened. You can't die at 20! Stupid bastards! Is it right to bring a child into the world? Second thoughts? Not with you. With you I'd go... anywhere. It's our jobs. Our child won't have any problems because of our work. It's bizarre, as if I feel... bound to protect him from all the world's evil. You'll find the right way to love him. - I'm worried. - Stop it. Lorenzo, come here. Soon, we'll be 3 against 3. I want a cuddle, too. Umberto... What's wrong? - My God. - What? Look! Oh, my God! - Are you in pain? Where? - I'm not in pain. - It hurts here. - We're going to hospital. I don't want to move from here. Armida, I'm calling the doctor. Be quiet, it's nothing. Calm down, I'll be right back. Smooth operator... Jack, come here! 1, 2... Go! I fancy a holiday. Really? Easter's coming. We could take a trip. Where do you want to go? To Normandy. Normandy. I'd like my son to be conceived there. It's been 3 months. It's time. I want us to try again. Your son or your daughter? Son, daughter... both. Both... and loads more afterwards. I want a football team! Find yourself another girl. No, I only want you! Stuck in the house, squeezing out kids, until the end of time. Don't you like kissing me? Shouldn't you get up? Later. Federico's picking me up. Who's Federico? I don't know him. It's all fine. No, it's not. What will you wear? I only have eyes for you. You only have eyes for me... I have everything for you. I'll do the shopping. See you tonight! All right, see you tonight. Bye, sweetheart. - Ms Miserere. - She's in a meeting. Excuse us. Cardi, hello. I'd like a word with you. Someone must have broken their parole! Where can we go? Into my office. I'll be right back. This way, please. So, Cardi, what's this all about? There's been... Something's happened to your partner. If you'll come with us, we'll take you to the scene. I can't look at him. I can't! We have to take him home. We'll find Umberto's murderer. I promise. You mustn't let anyone convince you it was your fault. Is that clear? Come on. It's ready. You must eat something. It's very sad. Did you know Mormile? He came to pick up the Governor sometimes. Seems he was playing tricks on someone in Opera. There are rules in prison. He should have expected it. Do you know something? You're obliged to pass it on to the prosecutor. Has no one ever told you? You know the rules? Hello. A cigarette... Ms Miserere. Hello. Sgt Major Stefano Frati, and my colleague... Corporal Antonio Manghi. The Chief sent us to escort you. You must have been notified. I don't need an escort. It's easier for everyone. Do as you please. A fine murder. A real murder. A wonderful murder. You couldn't do a lovelier one. We've never seen anything like it. This performance is dedicated to Umberto Mormile. I've something to say on behalf of all the Opera inmates. Umberto... you weren't just a support, a hope for us. You were a friend. You believed in us when no one else listened, or believed in us. Not even ourselves. Umberto, all that you did we'll remember forever. I promise. Call from Opera. Looking for Umberto 'Ndraghetta, Musitano clan A warning for me Execution at traffic lights Gentlemen, come in and have something to eat. It's late. Is that allowed? With pleasure! We're coming. That's enough, Jack. What's the other one called? Jack's the male, Lea the female. You sign here. The keys are in the ignition. Monte Alpe Reserve, 1993 Lea! I'm going to ask for a transfer. - Where do you want to go? - It doesn't matter. I'm ready to go anywhere. I'll go where no one else wants to go. It's been 3 years, they haven't the slightest clue. 3 years... The answer's in prison, Riccardo. You know. That's where the truth lies about Umberto's death. Pianosa Prison, 1993 At the moment, we have 300 inmates, including 60 held under Article 41-bis for Mafia-related crimes, like Nitto Santapaola, Michele Papa and Pietro Vernengo... Yes, I know. The staff? 700 officers on rotating shifts. In the port, I got the impression that the men were surprised to see me. Actually, we preferred not to tell them beforehand... that the new governor was a woman. You're currently the only woman on the island. Hello. Ready? We'll take the central corridor before going to the Pegaso. Good. - Perfect. - Open up! Surprise search! Get up! Stand there. Mouth. Go on... Officer, stop immediately! But Governor, he attacked a colleague. These bastards have to pay. Take him to the infirmary. All right? Go to the infirmary as well. I want a detailed report on what happened. Very well, Governor. Let me go! Get your filthy hands off! Move! Into the yard with the others. We're not the criminals here! You know the drill for making a complaint. They beat us here! Beat us! All right! He did that to himself. He's a compulsive liar. These are the last ones. Thanks. Maurizio, wait. There... I want them to leave immediately. These are the officers' transfer requests. Why not wait a few days until the end of their assignments? They leave the island immediately, or it's the disciplinary committee. I won't put up with any more unjustified bad treatment. Is that clear? Thank you. You should slow down a bit. When I've finished. Go on... There's a prisoner here in Pianosa. Patruno. I didn't say anything to avoid giving you false hope. He was in Opera when Mr Mormile was working there. He knows your story. Patruno trusts you. He'll see you if we guarantee absolute secrecy. - Shall I arrange it? - Of course. Thanks. Governor? Come here. We don't have much time. I'm at your service. Patruno, you were... an inmate of Opera Prison in 1990. No one knows I'm here. And no one will know. You have my word. I haven't seen my family for 2 years. I can't promise you anything. - I've supplies to unload. - Wait. But I can assure you that my reports to the supervising judge will be in your favour. I'll make sure that your wife can come. If that's not enough for you, this discussion is over. Thank you. Umberto Mormile wasn't meant to die. Why did they kill him? He saw some things he shouldn't have. Who did it? Patruno, tell me who killed him. Is someone there? Tell me who it was! Tell me! Warder! - Have you told the judge? - No, we have to do it. Morning, Governor. You seem in a good mood. It's good to see. Drop your shoulders. Good. Four and one, five. Well now... Get a move on! I don't feel like playing. - What? - I don't feel like it. But I was winning. You win every evening. It's true. Listen, Ma'am, I'm really sorry that you're going. Seriously. We need someone like you. Thank you. Thanks, Fabio. Really. Know where they're sending you? Wherever they're in the shit. - And us as well. - Maybe Sulmona. They just opened a prison. Let them send someone else! Why's it always Armida? Because Armida always says yes. I've no family. I'll get cross in a minute. We've been together for 3 years. We're your family. You're right, Stefano. You're my family. A toast. To the family! The family! Sorry. To Armida! Thank you all. Jack? You're here. Hi, Maurizio. - They followed me. - Come in. Come on, Lea. Up you go. They followed me here. They're fond of you, too. Can I come in for a minute? Sure. I'm packing. Come in. I always leave it to the last minute. I'm always travelling. You don't have much stuff. I wanted to give you this. A little souvenir. A mark of my esteem. A mark of esteem... It's pretty. Wait, I'll put it on for you. It's to wear around the neck? It suits you. Are we that close? - Since when? - Now. Say I'm not dreaming. Tell me it's real. Say it will last forever. - So? - It's nearly ready. You're still here? - Anything else? - Nutmeg. So in short... At this moment... Am I mistaken or have you news? Armida Miserere, one name, two tragedies... is in love. 38 years old, green eyes, strong, loyal, but above all... The Maurizio from Pianosa? I should have known when you spoke about him. But? I know you too well. There has to be a "but". Married. Is that all? Two children. Why make things simple? Here are the logs. So? Will you tell me about Palermo? Caselli is at the Prosecutor's Office 24 hours a day. We work flat out, too. It's a war. A real war. To beat Cosa Nostra, we need a prison in which you won't die for doing your job. Since they killed Montalto in the street, the atmosphere is... oppressive. The prosecutor thought of you. You've just taken over at Sulmona, but we'd like you to run Ucciardone. What do you say? I don't fancy it... I want to wait for Maurizio. It's my last chance to live a normal life. Enough of this craziness, I want a quiet life. I understand. I don't know if I can resign myself to it, but I'm happy for you. - Will you make it? - Sure! How about you? Maurizio... No, I was out running. Everything's fine. Get off, Jack. Lea is outside. Are you all right? Don't worry. I can wait. Have you spoken to the children? Oh... I see. So... you're not coming? Never again? I see... For my own good. Where are the cars? Come on! Beautiful, isn't it? Palermo Prison, Ucciardone Within these walls, on the 6th of August, 1985, the death of superintendent Ninni Cassarà was applauded. On the 23rd of May, 1992, they drank to the murder of Giovanni Falcone. We all know that the orders came from inside. The loss of Giuseppe Montalto was a hard blow for us all, but above all for you who worked alongside him. We shall never forget him. Never again will harm be done to an officer or a government representative. Neither here nor elsewhere. The rules will be applied without exception, or derogation. As for Article 41-bis, prisoners will get 2 hours outside per day, but always alone. Visits take place behind glass. No phone calls, all mail will be censored, one parcel per month, only authorised articles. You know the rules. They'll be applied to the letter. Search! What does the slag want? - What did you say? - Nothing. Trousers off. Underwear as well. We're just doing our job. - Hurry up. - All right. Squat 3 times. Why are you busting our balls? We've had enough! - It's our job. - Your job... I don't mean you. You're just a sad bastard who's exploited. I'm talking about the shitty State which is really pissing me off! What are you doing? It's pissing me off! Here, the State is me. Into solitary! Immediately! To the fallen in the fight against the Mafia Welcome. Mr Caselli. Armida Miserere. We asked you here because we've an emergency. I'm listening. Tell her. We spotted the Brusca brothers in a house in Cannatello. Our officers intercepted their phone calls. We've arrested Falcone's murderer. That's great news! We need a safe place, away from prying eyes. I have to question him without anyone seeing or hearing. Today? If possible. No problem! This way. Good evening, Mr Caselli. Evening, Brusca. Come in. Brusca's come clean. We have to check his account, but he's collaborating. We may be just in time to prevent some murders. I'm happy, Riccardo. You know, I've never felt so uneasy about meeting someone. I couldn't bear the idea of touching his hand. Shaking hands with someone who strangled a boy and threw him in acid? Who blew away Falcone and his escort? I shook... I shook his hand because Falcone would have. He thought, despite everything, that they were men. And he fought to free Sicily from the Mafia. How are you? I can't work you out. Good, bad... Like so. Neither alive nor dead. I'm just so. I know what you're thinking. We'll find the truth about Umberto. We'll do it. Shall I buy you dinner? I'm done in. I'm going home to bed. I'm asleep on my feet. All right. Good night. Great. Good evening. Shall I take you home? Yes. Actually, no. Let's take a drive and see Palermo. What's love, to you? To me, love... is a hope. It comes from the soul. What is it to you? Sex. Because I've lost my soul. I'm sorry, Ma'am. Good night. Stefano? Jack? Lea? My God! Help! Youth Detention Centre, Mantou, 1997 We wanted to have a library inside our prison. I wanted to name it after Umberto Mormile, because he, like you and me, believed that culture could open minds and offer the possibility, in the future, of making new choices, to those who, so young, spend years in prison. I thank Armida Miserere for being with us today for this inauguration. Thank you. That's enough cigarettes. I think a prison should be a prison and that the inmates should perform their duties. I'm not running a 5-star hotel. I run a place of correction, for atrocious crimes. Having said that, it's hard to free oneself from this love; the love of those lives locked up inside a prison. Umberto Mormile was an extraordinary teacher who loved his work deeply and who passed on this love to all those who were lucky enough to know him and to work with him. Excuse me, could you come for a minute? I'll be back. Hello. This is Yuri... and Liuba. They just arrived. - They're for you. - They're mine? They're adorable. They're really sweet. You'll get on great. Stefano, I love you. Thanks. They're lovely! - Which one is he? - I don't know. Stefano... You're so cute. Yuri! Be good. Sulmona Prison, 2001 A bit of a din... You like it? Very much. We could make it a bit bigger. Extend it by a few metres. Bring it out here. Who's stopping us? The dogs would have more room. More will be coming. Happily, but we don't have the budget. I know. But I'm happy. They're protesting in solidarity with prisoner Cossu. To make an uproar, yes. All right. No protests. You might perhaps see him. Bring him to my office. Come in. Please. Cossu, Franco. You ask to be transferred to a re-education facility. That's right. Since the accident, I haven't recuperated. The doctor says that your legs work perfectly. I put in a request for a second opinion. You can see the state I'm in. Mr Cossu, get up, please. Up. Well done. Walk. Walk! Oh, come on! He's having us on. The wheelchair's requisitioned, from this moment. You'll die, you filthy whore! Get out. Crackpot! Torture in Sulmona prison! They're accusing me! It's only a newspaper... Don't worry. They need a headline per day. Torture, bad treatment! Are you kidding me? Because I took a wheelchair from a jerk... who was messing us about? They shot Umberto. And I have to follow the rules! "They won't tolerate any more of this behaviour"! Me! You've eaten nothing. I've something important to tell you. More important than this? More serious than this? I was waiting until it was official, but you'll read it tomorrow in the press. In Milan, Prosecutor Nobili arrested 33 members of N'drangheta. Amongst them, are Umberto's murderers. What are you saying? Why didn't you tell me? I only just heard. Who are they? Zigania, Cammarana, Esposito. The ones your investigations pointed out. Your suspicions were well founded. My God! We've done it. On the 11th of April, 1990, the Opera prison teacher was murdered, Umberto Mormile. Do you accept responsibility for this murder? Yes, I did it. The murder was ordered by Antonio Zigania. Franco Zigania had been transferred from Parma to Opera. He was furious with Mormile because he was supposed to give him a glowing report, but he was dragging his feet. So Antonio Zigania, Franco's brother, decided to kill him. I offered my services. Why did Zigania expect this favour? Because Mormile was corrupt? Antonio Zigania had given him 30 million lira. But afterwards, he gave the money back, saying he couldn't do anything. To your knowledge, had Mormile agreed to do favours like this before? He'd done them... In Parma, several times. So why not this time? How do I know? He must have got sick of it. Mormile was a complicated guy. He put on an act. Your honour, 6 shots were fired. He died instantly due to serious endocranial lesions. The shots were all fired from a distance of 40cm. Mr Mormile was an honest person. He had decided to refuse the money from Franco Zigania. But that offended Zigania. It hurt his dignity as a boss. He therefore asked his brother to eliminate him. Antonio Zigania hired Cammarana to carry out the murder. On that day, Paolini drove the bike and Cammarana shot Mormile 6 times at point blank range at the lights between Binasco and Melegnano. Armida? Do you need anything? How can they let them tarnish his reputation! It's manipulation. They're protecting other people's interests. The judges won't believe them. We know who Umberto was. Know what I'd like? I'd like a child. Come here. Why didn't I have one? Now, it's too late. - Bravo. - Did you like it? And you? Very much. You're very good. Sulmona Prison, April 18th 2003 Good morning. Carry on. Well! Very pretty. - You'll be ready? - No problem. Ready by 6, when the fraternity comes to pick it up. Stefano, I'm not going to the procession. Apologise to the mayor for me. I'm exhausted. Do you need anything? Sleep. Just sleep. Our revels now are ended. These our actors, as I foretold you, were all spirits, and are melted into air, into thin air. And like the baseless fabric of this vision, the cloud-capp'd tow'rs, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself, yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, and, like this insubstantial pageant faded, leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff as dreams are made on; and our little life is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd; Bear with my weakness; my brain is troubled: Be not disturb'd with my infirmity: If you be pleased, retire into my cell and there repose: a turn or two I'll walk, to still my beating mind. Sulmona, Friday 18th April, 2003. It's Good Friday, and like Christ, I'm walking my Way of the Cross. I'm tired. Too tired. My work and recognition aren't enough to make up for the pain that has always accompanied me. I've no place left in me for love, understanding, wisdom, generosity. There remains one last act of courage... to crush those who have betrayed me and hurt me. I don't forgive myself for believing in a dream, or those that shattered it. I ask nothing for myself. Just that Stefano show compassion for my dogs, and that Yuri and Liuba can stay with him. I don't want a funeral or crocodile tears. I'd rather be cremated and scattered to the wind. Because I was nothing but wind. Adaptation: Clare McAllister Subtitling TITRA FILM Paris
