[upbeat music] [electronic music] [drum music] - [Narrator] Since time immemorial, Cantrip Towers has been a very special place. This is because hidden deep in the vault of the estate is an elf dust fountain. With the help of this magical elf dust, one can master the four elements, fire, water, earth, and air. Whenever four sisters are born in the Cantrip family, they use their powers to serve the people. Until one day, a daughter was born to one of the siblings who would possess a very special ability. Glenda could alter objects. For this reason, her father saw her as the chosen one that could master all four elements alone. As soon as he decided Glenda was old enough, the two of them reached for the power, but Glenda's spell was not permanent and the three brothers resolutely turned on the traitor. One day, Glenda manages to once again sneak into the compass rose room only to discover, much to her horror, that the elf dust fountain was closed. Oh, how she was filled with hate that day against her brothers, who she feels conspired against her. She was not going to let go of this. - Hey, who was that? Hey! So wicked. - It's still not ready? I have to wake Sky up soon. - Give me another 10 minutes, Flame. And Flora, the dots on the ladybugs aren't there for you to eat them. - I know. - [Mom] Flora. I know, the Sista Magic at the Royal Music Hall. That would be so nice. - Marina, it's time. - Yeah, in a minute. - No, I mean, now. - See you later, Verena, okay? Just a second. - Marina. - But this is my outfit for the audition today. - Is that all the rage now? - Hey, careful. - Come now. - I'll just be a minute. Mhm. - [Girls] Happy birthday, Sky! - Welcome to the club. [glass shattering] [girls shouting] - [Sky] Hey, what's all this? - Fritzy's doing fine. - Luckily. Look what you've done. - Mhm. [glass tinkling] - Marina, we need water. [water splashing] - You can do magic too? - We can all do magic since we were nine, that's why were hoping it would happen to you too. Now there's four of us. - I can float stuff through the air. - Flame, you're up next. [flame crackling] - Why didn't any of you tell me you could do magic? We could be big stars on the internet. - We don't have these powers so that we can become famous. - Then why do we have them then? - Just gets dressed. - Done that. Today I'm wearing my lucky pajamas. - Are you kidding me? There's no way you're going to school in your pajamas. We're singing today. - Okay then, only the top? - That sucked. - Huh uh. - Hurry up. - Hang on. First I want to know, how is it that we can do magic? - I don't know, but now we can find out. Come on, let's go. - Where to? - [Girls] To the basement. - Sky. Happy birthday, my sweetheart. - Just guess what's happened? I can, ow! - What can you do? - She can count backwards now. - Yeah. - Yeah, very nice. Now please come with me. Oh no, wait, stop, I forgot the candles. - They don't know. - And we don't say anything either. - But why not? - When it first started with me, I was so excited I told them. Mom dropped the coffee can in shock and Dad drove the car out of the garage and straight into a tree because he was so upset and wanted to take me to the doctor. - You know the way they are, loving but not really helpful. - And did they take you to the doctor? - No, I told them real fast that I had just made it up. Everybody was relieved, and we never spoke about it again. That means not a word, it's better that way. - [Mom] You can all come now! - And just act normal, okay? - So guys, can we go? I have something I have to do. - But don't you want your presents? - Later this afternoon. - But Sky, dear, we haven't sung for you yet. - Eh, at my age, that stuff isn't necessary anymore. - But we're singing afterwards at school. - Hey, is something going on? - [Girls] No. - What would be going on? - It's just that it makes me wonder why you wouldn't jump at the chance to sing. I thought you girls loved to sing. - Yeah, okay. ♪ Happy birthday to me ♪ Happy birthday to me ♪ Happy birthday, dear Sky ♪ Happy birthday to me - But you can't sing happy birthday to yourself. - If it's my birthday, then I'm allowed to sing. - Then sing one of your songs. How about my favorite song? ♪ If you're on the ground in the pouring rain ♪ ♪ We're there for each other ♪ When you go through flames and stand in hurricanes ♪ ♪ We're there for each other ♪ Because we're often alone, too small on our own ♪ ♪ Never let go of your dreams ♪ For together we are great ♪ We are great - Uh, bye. - But the song has three more verses. - [gasping] A secret passage? - A secret room, but shh, only we know about it. And now you do too. - [Sky] [laughing] Cool. Wicked. - Wait until you see this here. - Wow. - Now that Sky has her magical abilities as well, we'll finally unravel the mystery of the wind rose. - But the fact is that you couldn't do anything without me. - Without each other. It takes eight hands. - It takes eight hands because if it's only me, then what are you gonna do-- - Sky. - Okay, okay. - So now we put our hands on those hand prints and wait and see what happens. [dramatic music] [symbol rumbling] - Wow. [fountain booming] [girls shouting] [cup rattling] [magic humming] - The fountain has opened again. Pixie dust hangs in the atmosphere. - What's that? - Shut your mouth. At last, I can fulfill my father's dream and take on the powers of the elements to myself. Then I'll be the most powerful sorceress in the world. I must get to the fountain. I have to go to Cantrip Towers. Oswald, call them right up and tell them that I want to buy the old box. Make these Cantrips an offer that they can't refuse. And pack the suitcase. [magic humming] [teapot shattering] Get going. - Yes, my lady. [dramatic music] [magic humming] - So now is the time, Baxter. [Baxter grumbling] The moths fly to the light. Time to collect dust. It's going to Cantrip Towers. - Crazy. - It looks so beautiful. Just look how it lights up. - Flora, we're all standing right in front of it. - Oh yeah, right. And what do we do now? [magic twinkling] - Super cool. [girls laughing] - Do you feel that tickling in your fingers? - It almost feels like the power is going through us. [dramatic music] - [Flora] Whoa! - Wow, how crazy. [Sky laughing] - [Girls] Sky! - I have super powers! - The rose has strengthened our powers. - And now you, Flame. [flame roaring] - Whoa! - Wow! - Mega. - Marina, do something. [water splashing] - Girls, girls, where are you? You have to get going. You have to get to your auditions. - Yeah, we're coming! - Ah, good. - This afternoon, we'll meet here again. But don't do magic until then. Sky! Especially not in public. You know how dangerous that is. - Yes. [magic twinkling] - Cheers! - Bye. All the best. - Cheers, mama. - Cheers. - No thanks. No, no, no, no. - What's up with that colorful cloud and why did it shine? - Let's go. We will solve this puzzle together but as inconspicuously as possible. - We don't want to sell this house. - I'm sorry, my lady, the Cantrips don't want to sell the house. - What, what? A small-town conductor and a cellist? That must be an incredible amount of money for them. - Maybe the Cantrips like their house. - Oh, did he say anything else? - No, only so long as the roof over their heads doesn't collapse, they're not selling. - Hm, we'll see about that. [violin music] - Marina, super outfit like always. - Thank you. - You've got to put more work into it. You can't perform like that at the Royal Music Hall. - Verena, we're not even in the semifinals yet. - But it's totally obvious you'll make it. Just listen to the competition. [audience applauding] You guys are up next. - Thank you. - That was Ricardo Schmitz from Class 3A. [audience applauding] And now the Sista Magic. [audience applauding] - Stop, where are you going? - I need my lucky top. - Not now. [magic twinkling] Hey, are you kidding me? Stop that right now. I told you it's forbidden to... [crowd gasping] - [Quinn] Hey, is everything okay? - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. - Hey. - Hi. - Is it my turn now? Hey, it's okay, are you ready? - Yeah.

What are we starting? - I see that you have no idea. - Who are you? - The name is Miss Duggery, and I have very important work to do. - Oh, I get it, you're the new help. You'll have to excuse me, but my husband didn't tell me that he had found someone. Hi, welcome. - It's not my problem if you two don't talk to each other. - We do that, except... Okay, I have to practice now, and later I have my orchestra rehearsal. Will you be all right on your own? - I will be a lot better off on my own. - Very good. - Yes. - Till later. [Baxter grumbles] - Yes. Okay, Sidney, on to the elves dust source. [Baxter mumbling excitedly] Slowly, old man, slowly. You don't want to choke. [audience applauding] - Thank you, Sista Magic, that was super. The jury will soon announce their decision. How does it look? The decision please. The Sista Magic [audience applauding] will represent our school in the semifinal. The five best acts are going to the grand finale. You guys will definitely be in. - Hi. Oh, sorry, I meant-- - You guys were super good. You'll go to the final, it's a sure bet. - Miss Duggery, what are you doing? - Well, what's it look like I'm doing? - Dusting. - Well, then that must be what I'm doing. - But outside? - It doesn't make much sense to dust inside. If you stand there and watch, then Baxter can't concentrate. - I have to go now. - Yeah, I'm not stopping you, go, go. - Cheers. - So Baxter. - Mhm. - Our work is done and the girls are up to bat. [Baxter mumbling] Really, all used? [Baxter mumbling] But the house is locked. [Baxter mumbling] What are you talking about? I can't do magic. No, there is no more elf dust today, stop complaining. [door buzzing] [door buzzing] - Pixie dust. Everything's covered in pixie dust. - Eureka, just what my lady wanted. - Moron, somebody put a protective shield over the house. I need fresh pixie dust. - Don't get excited, my lady. You know what'll happen if you do. [Glenda retching] [toad croaking] - Oswald, do something. - Think about something beautiful, something that makes you happy and puts you in a good mood again. [Glenda retching] [toad croaking] What if you think about small, sweet kittens? - I hate cats, you know that. [Glenda retching] [toad croaking] - Then think of barbecued kittens. - What was it this Cantrip said again? As long as the roof doesn't fall in over their heads, they won't sell. Oh yeah, that's a possibility. [bird squawking] [roof rumbling] Now let's go before anybody sees us. [bird squawking] - My lady, once you've acquired Cantrip Towers, does that then mean our deal is done? - Three years, my dear, three years was the deal, and it's only been two years and nine months. - Yes, but-- - Yes, but they should have thought about it before they laughed about my disability. - But toads hop out of your mouth when you're upset and get hiccups. That is definitely funny [laughing]. - No, it's definitely not funny. [magic buzzing] [hog oinking] [horn honking] [magic buzzing] - If in the end you can't do magic when you are stricken with hiccups, then it's a disability, and one doesn't laugh at that, even if your magical powers exceed your disability by a wide margin. - Exactly. And now call up Cantrip Towers and offer twice as much as the house is worth. [phone ringing] - Collin Cantrip. [phone ringing] - Collin. - Thanks. Collin Cantrip. - We are going to double our offer. - Excuse me? - [Oswald] For Cantrip Towers. - I've already told you this isn't about money. - But I implore you, it's always about money. You should take the time to-- - Excuse me. I'll call you back. - Hello, hello? He hung up on me. - How can something like this happen? - Yeah, it's an old roof. I should've renewed it a long time ago. - But there's a whole other reason for it. Maybe it has something to do with the rose. It vibrated so much. - I don't know how on earth we're supposed to pay for this. The house is already swallowing so much money. This man that wants to buy the house, he's just called about it again. He doubled the offer. - Can I do something? If we all give up our allowances maybe? - Thanks, my sweet, but that really wouldn't be enough. - Who the heck is that? - Hm? - Hm? - Who? - I don't see anyone. - Let's go inside, we have to talk. - We've received an offer for the house. Someone wants to buy Cantrip Towers, and they have offered twice as much as it's worth. - Up to now, we've rejected such offers. But now all of you have to decide. - How come we? - Because the house belongs to all of you. It's your inheritance. - What now? Flame, Marina, Flora, and me, we own Cantrip Towers? - How is that? - Sidney Cantrip, your great grandfather, put it right in the will. - If four sisters are born into a family, the house goes to the four sisters after the fourth child has her ninth birthday. - In any case, you have to decide whether the house is to be sold or not. Nobody's offered so much money up to now. - And where would we live then? - The big city, that has so many advantages. - How can you even think of that? - What about it? I did not say we should sell the house. - This is not up for debate. We're not selling. - Hey, can we at least talk about it? You can't decide about everything. - Use your brains, this is a special house. - So no matter how you choose, we will support you. - Think it over carefully and then take a vote. - And do it anonymously. The majority wins. - Whoever wants to sell lays a marble in the bowl. - It's every man for himself when no one else is around. If and when three marbles are in the bowl the house is sold. Uh, maybe we better use something else. No, marbles. So-- - Thank you. - [Mom] You're welcome. - Who did it? Who put the marble in the bowl? - Well, so much for it being anonymous. - So you were the one. - Nope, maybe, what does it matter who it was? - Yeah, exactly. - So it was you. Should've occurred to me. - And if it was, what are you gonna do about it? - Flame, stop with all the drama now. - Just stop, it was me. - [Flame] You, how come? - Because I don't want Mom and Dad having to worry about money. - This is a very special house. Come, let's go to the rose. [dramatic music] - Where are you going now, Oswald? Is this the way to my five-star hotel? - Ah, well, about the hotel-- - What, what, what? - It's booked up. All the hotels in the neighborhood were booked. There was only one accommodation that had a free room somewhat out of the way. - How many stars? - None. [Glenda groaning] It is a small, privately owned bed and breakfast in the forest. My apologies, my lady. That's it. - I think you have to be joking, that is-- [stomach gurgling] - Don't get excited, don't get upset. [Glenda retching] [toad croaking] [Glenda retching] [toad croaking] - Limping hamsters, whimpering pups. Darn it, what did you suggest? - Barbecued kittens. [Glenda retching] - Barbecued kittens, barbecued kittens. This has to be some kind of joke. - Does that mean we're driving on? - Yes, of course. No, wait, the view is a lot better than I first thought. Gather up the creatures. I can use them to buy Cantrip Towers. - Where am I supposed to put them? I say, that's my suitcase. - Of course it is. You think I'd use mine? [toads croaking] - Okay, just think about what's been going on. Our roof collapses. A strange woman sneaks around the garden. Someone offers way too much money for our house. This is no coincidence. It's all got something to do with this rose. - Careful. [magic humming] - [gasping] There's something on here. Elements. - There are more leaves inside, and there's something on this too. - Cool, a puzzle. Conquer the world together, cool. - Responsibility of the elements. The responsibility of the world. - Be heedful of the elements. - We'll take the one with the conquering the world thing. - No, all the words must be accommodated, and the colors have to match. Four elements. - [Sky] Together rule. - The world. - Be aware of the responsibility. - Four elements together rule the world. Be aware of the responsibility. - That sounds creepy. - Mhm. - We're not allowed to do more magic until we find out what's going on with the house. - I think that we should use our magical powers to repair the roof. - Yeah, then we don't have to sell. Mom and Dad have rehearsal the whole day tomorrow. - Tomorrow we'll go first to the city archive. There we can find accounting records of Cantrip Towers. - We can do both tomorrow. First repair the roof, then go to the city. - And how do you explain the repaired roof to Mom and Dad? - I would just talk a lot of nonsense to them. After a few minutes of that, they're so exhausted that they stop asking questions. - Okay. - Yes! [dramatic music] [Baxter grumbles] - I know, I don't like this Glenda either, bleh. I just knew she would pop up, and so I booked every free hotel room in town. [Baxter laughing] I need to know what she's up to. - Hello, anyone there? - Yes. - Yes, so what about breakfast? - No, thank you, I already ate. - I booked a room with breakfast included. On the sign in front of your house, it says bed and breakfast. - Tea, my lady? - Oswald, where have I ended up? Does that old thing work? - Not by itself. You have to look through it. - The point of my question being whether one is allowed to use it or not. - Well, then you can always ask. - Can I use this looking glass? - Sure, you don't have to ask. [Glenda retching] [toad croaking] No pets allowed in the house. - Cheers, Dad. - And you're sure that you want to take the bus? - Yes. - Yeah, bye Dad, bye Mom. - Cheers, Mama. - Cheers. - Ciao. - Okay, let's get to work.

[Glenda shouting] What's this animal doing here? - He lives here. - Oh really? - He's a watch horse. - Does he bark like a dog if someone comes? - No, he whistles. [whistling] - Oswald, where are you? You must shadow these girls. I must know everything about them, and then I would... - Better understand them. - What is going on with you? Don't mix yourself in my monologue. Sow the seeds of discord, and do it before they unite against me. - [Girls] Yes! - Come on, we have to go. - How come and where? - We have research to do, we already talked about that. In the city archives. - Why is it you get to order us around all the time? - Because I'm the oldest. I'll bet this just didn't happen without someone's doing. - Of course not, we did magic, you twerp. - I'm talking about how the roof got damaged. - But now it's fixed, and I have to really focus on the outfits for our performance. I'll meet soon with Verena, she found a really super store with really outstanding clothes. - Okay, fine, you go shopping while the rest of us go to the city archive. - [Flora] Flame. - Sky! Come, you can come get it tomorrow. Flora, where are you going? - To the music store to buy some sheet music. And then home. I have to work on our composition. - You guys make me crazy. - The Sista Magic are important too. - Sista Magic? - Of course, but you are coming with me. - No, that's not possible, I have karate now. - Why do I have to do everything myself? You guys always find a way out of things. - Thanks for doing everything for us all by yourself, bye. - Bye. - Cheers. - Bye. [dramatic music] [Oswald grumbling] - Oswald! My tea doesn't get served by itself. - Very good. - And so what makes the girls tick, hm? What are the weak points? Where do we begin our assault? - I think that it's the singing together as Sista Magic. They have a performance coming up soon. - That's perfect. One only has to, actually that's way too easy. Well well, then we'll poison the mood in the band really nicely. [laughing] - Hm, also four siblings. Huh, is that about... The woman from our garden? That's impossible. Mrs. Duggery, housekeeper of Cantrip Towers. - Oh, I found a really nice dress, have a look. - That's really nice. - So yeah-- - The girl in front of the mirror is Marina. - So the fabric is, of course, cool, but I think I like this one, right? - [Verena] I think so. It's hard to say which one. - Well, maybe both together. - Perfect. So what are we going to do with the hair, hm? - Hey, what's all this? - I'm putting together a girl band, and you're in. You have talent, young lady. - Who are you? - Oh, pardon me, where are my manners? I'm Gloria, talent scout. I can spot talent from miles away. So come over on Friday at 3:00 to the lobby of the Grand Hotel, that's where I'm staying. Then we can talk all about it. - I can't, I have to perform with my sisters together in the semifinal of the school competition. - Oh, Lordy Lord, how provincial. You were born for the big stage. I have a feeling that you are the most talented of all these. Hm, psst, my little friend here will take both of them. I'll pay. - Hey, hello. - That was super rude. - So you wish to pay for these? - She knocked me out of the way. - Oh Lordy, how petty. [magic buzzing] That should do. - My testament. Mrs. Duggery, I hereby bequeath to you my hunting lodge. - Bye. - That is Sky. - Yoohoo, hello. I've seen you fighting, you're very talented. - I know. - Do you want to drive in a Jaguar? - Are you crazy? As if I would hop into a car with total strangers. - And you're such a power girl. Exactly the kind I'm looking for for my karate kids show. On Friday evening, we have our auditions. Why don't you come by and-- - No way, that's our Sista Magic performance. - Child, it's rare when I ask anybody. You only get one chance. Clear that up with your singing group. Or does your opinion not count? - Of course my opinion counts. We have a democracy. We vote on everything, just like with our house. - What about your house? - Me and my three sisters have to decide whether we sell our house or not. And we're making a secret ballot. Whoever is for selling the house puts a marble in the bowl. When three marbles are in the bowl, the house is sold. That's called democracy. - You don't say. Don't forget now, Friday is the auditions. - Are you rich? - Yes. - When I'm big, I'm gonna be rich too. And then I'm gonna buy a car just like this. - But why wait so long until you're big? Maybe you'll have the opportunity a lot sooner. - Do you have any ideas? - You are a real smart cookie. Soon you will figure out how to get your hands on money. How many marbles are already in the bowl? - I don't know. - Bye now. [dramatic music] - Is there still more action called for to break up the band? - No, Oswald, the seed will take root. Though if you could pick up a bag of marbles for me, we could accelerate the process. [dramatic music] [bird squawking] [Flame gasping] Ah, so many years I've waited. And now the moment has finally come. I alone will control the four elements. - [Oswald] Excuse me, my lady, but you still don't own the pixie dust source, am I right? - [Glenda] On the contrary, my dear. Cantrip Towers is as good as mine. - [Flame] Mrs. Duggery wants our house. What's that about? - The first thing I'll do is, hm, let me think. Abolish rain. - But why, my lady? Plants and animals, they need-- - Whoever wants rain will have to pay through the nose. And people who want sunlight too. Plants will no longer grow free of charge. And people will have to apply for wind. [laughing] There won't be a country in the world that can stand against me. Close that window, Oswald. - There's Flame. [dramatic music] [Glenda growling] [glass shattering] [Flame screaming] - Quick, after her! She's heard everything. Bring her to me, Oswald! [dramatic music] [Oswald shouting] [mud squishing] [hog snorting] - Oh, yes? Did you also laugh at my lady's disability? [hog snorting] ♪ I can do anything linked to your side ♪ ♪ I can do everything at your side ♪ ♪ You just need to snap your fingers ♪ ♪ And the whole world passes by ♪ ♪ Every moment enchants me - Yeah, I imagined it like that. - Do you also think that I'm maybe a little more talented than the others? - As who? - As, for example, Flame? - Flame, she just has her head somewhere else at the moment. - Yeah, she doesn't take the performance seriously enough. - Say, do I really have to be there tomorrow? - At the competition? - I mean, whether it's three or four sisters doesn't make a difference, right? - Are you kidding me? I'm here knocking myself out for all of you, and you're thinking of not showing up? - Oh, but you guys know karate is really my thing. - I was right, this weird lady, her name is Mrs. Duggery. She wants the pixie dust fountain in our cellar. - What, what for? - She wants to control the elements but only for her own benefit. We have to protect Cantrip Towers. We shouldn't leave the house anymore for anything. - Flame, tomorrow afternoon is the semifinal, and we have to be there. - Forget it, we're staying here. This is our responsibility. - You can't order us around. We're going on. - I'm staying here. - You know what? Stay here then, we don't need you. It's not like you're the most talented one of us anyway. - [Sky] Exactly. - But there's always four of us when the Sista Magic go on. - Not tomorrow, the house is more important. - Please come with us, don't leave us in the lurch. - You're the ones leaving me in the lurch and the house. - Then let's sell the stupid house, and then the problem is solved. - We're not supposed to do that. We have to protect the pixie fountain. - Only one more to go. [dramatic music] - Well, how is the roof fine again? There was such a hole. - This cannot be real. - Yes, but there were two men who asked us if they should help, and we said yes. And then we thought, wouldn't this be great if we could get the roof fixed? And then they said, can I go up there? And we said, sure you can go up there. And then they asked, can I really go up there? And then we said, sure you can really go up there. And then we thought, hm, should we well Mom and Dad? - Flame, you have to come with us. - No, you guys have to stay. We have to protect the fountain. - So that is your plan, to sit in the entry hall and stare at the door? - Of course not. In between, I have to eat something. - You are so egotistical, Flame. - Me? You are so egotistical. [doorbell ringing] So what, you're telling me now you come... I know what you're doing. I knew we would end up here crossing paths. - Very nice. Then get out of the way so that I can do my work. - I bet you sure would like that. - Well, I don't know if like is the right term. [dramatic music] [both groaning] [blow cracking] - Ow! Now that's enough. You'll never step in this house again. [Baxter grumbling] - Baxter, we have a problem. - [Baxter] Mhm. - Flame is making a big mistake. Oh, I was afraid of this. The protection has diminished. [Baxter grumbling] We need to get back in there urgently. - Flame sure can get on my nerves. - What do we do now? Our song was meant for four voices. - Let us just give it up. I want to go to karate. - Sky, what now? - And what's with the Sista Magic? - I could ask Verena if she could stand in for Flame. She has a good voice and knows our show. - I don't know if that's the right thing to do. - I'm just not gonna let Flame ruin our chances. - Where's Flame? - Sick. - Something bad? - No, but bad enough that she won't come to the semifinals. - Hi, Marina. - Verena, are you maybe able to help us out with something? We have a problem with Flame. [doorbell ringing] - She just doesn't give up. - Whoa, is this the usual greeting with you? Or is it raining in the house? - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Should we keep going? I heard you're sick. I thought I would pop over and bring you some fruit. You know, for vitamins and stuff. - Thanks. - Can I come in? - Um, well, sure. - [Quinn] Are we just gonna stand here? - No, sure, yeah.

[audience applauding] - Third place goes to Linus Bruhn. [audience applauding] The fourth act for the finale are the Sugar Girls. [audience applauding] - I'm really sorry, Flame is really missed. I'm such a klutz. - And trailing just a little behind the others, Sista Magic. [audience applauding] - Yes! - Yeah! [upbeat music] [phone dinging] - Verena? [water splashes] Oh crap. Quinn, I'm really sorry about this, but my sisters are coming back and you have to go. - Is something wrong with me? - Yes, no, no, no, absolutely not. On the contrary. It's just somehow it's not good that they see you here because, well, actually-- - That's okay, actually you're supposed to be sick. - Yeah, exactly, I'm sick. - Okay then, cheers. - Cheers. Quinn, thanks. - We should do this more often. Let me know when you're sick again. - Yeah. [magic buzzing] Crap. What is going on? - I thought that was great of Verena that she jumped in, but I got so worried when she kinda lost it all. I mean, when she started and it wasn't really time yet. - What's the matter? - This is the matter. - Oh no. - Come on, we're going to the rose. - Do you know when the girls are coming back? - Later, not now. - I can't wait to see how they did in the semifinals. - The four of them are so perfect together. I'm sure they made it. - Yeah. Oh, just listen to this. They're raising the offer for the house again if we agree by tonight. Now that's pretty brash. - [Mom] Collin, can you come over here please? - It seems the girls have decided. - What do we do now? - It's their decision. - It's their house. - And they'll be getting an awful lot of money. They can afford a first-class education, and later each of them can buy a house according to their own taste. Financially, they'd be secure. - Yes, it's the wise decision. - Yeah, it's the wisest decision. - Mhm, mhm, mhm. Congratulations, my lady. Tou are now the owner of Cantrip Towers. - Ha, yes! Oswald, fetch the toads. [toads croaking] [magic buzzing] [doorbell ringing] - Why is the rose gone? You were supposed to watch the house. - Why didn't you guys help me? - Because we were busy getting to the final. - As if that counts for anything now. - We have to just lay our hands on it again. Maybe then something will happen. Come on, guys, try harder! I want my magic powers back. [Flame crying] - Hello, so you're back.

[laughing] Wow, I'm witty again today. - My lady, my time in your service is just about up. - Nonsense. When I'm the most powerful sorceress in the world, it's all the same to me whether your contract expires or not. - But my lady-- - And it just occurred to me that I need more personnel for this box, lots of little fools like you. - Then I would suggest that I make off immediately on my way to recruit more Oswalds for my lady. - Mhm, very good, my boy, very good. - Stop! I will not allow Cantrip Towers to fall into your hands. - Now that's enough, you're getting on my nerves. - I get that a lot. [horse whinnies] - Whoa. - You don't recognize me, do you? - Oh yes, you run that dreadful bed and breakfast. - I was the housekeeper for Cantrip Towers, and I've collected the last of the elf dust just as the fountain closed. - I do not memorize the faces of servants. [Mrs. Duggery shouting] [magic buzzing] I have no time for such things. [Baxter grumbling] [laughing] Mine, all mine. [magic buzzing] [Glenda whistling] [magic buzzing] [magic buzzing] [Glenda humming] Yeah, Uncle Sidney. Didn't quite work out, did it old chum? [laughing] [lights buzzing] No, not again, please! No, no, no, no! No! [audience applauding] - Thanks, thank you, thank you. Thank you very much. I am so excited, you cannot imagine.

[dramatic music] [magic buzzing] - Well, what do you know? It works. - We did it, I can't believe it. It was so awesome. The outfits were great, we looked so amazing. - Great, you girls are just great. - Thank you. - Sista Magic. Better make a note of that name. - You, you chased me through the woods. You wanted to catch me for this Mrs. Duggery. - Ah, but no, my dear Flame, it wasn't Mrs. Duggery who made me chase you. It was Glenda. - Who is Glenda? - You already know her. The talent scout was no talent scout. The karate promoter wasn't one either. She is your archenemy, and now I need your help. The whole world needs your help. - You're gonna have to do a lot more explaining. - Okay, let's start here. The third marble in your vote over the sale of the house wasn't dropped in the bowl by any one of you. - What? - So the jury has deliberated. Thank you very much. Two candidates made it to the finals. They will now compete against each other in the mega finale. It's Linus Bruhn! [audience applauding] And Sista Magic! First of all, we'll hear Linus Bruhn again. - Glenda wants to conquer the world, and that's why you have to do something, so that it does not come to a bad end. Apart from that, life as a boar is not for everyone. - I would love to help you. - But what? - But I... I have to talk to my sisters first. What do you guys think? - What, now you seriously want to hear what we think? - She already apologized. - We could possibly win this. You guys have dreamed of this moment, me too. - Yeah, we worked pretty hard to get here, and now we've made it to the final. This here, I mean, that's it, great. And that's why we should try it again next year. - Well, now let's go get our house back. - Yeah! - Yeah. - [Girls] Woohoo! - And now the Sista Magic. [audience applauding] Um, well, looks like the Sista Magic have decided not to seize the opportunity to win and become very famous. [dramatic music] - Come on. Is that Glenda? - Yes, it's her. - Too late, my dears. - It's really her. - Karate show, yeah right. - You're wrong, Glenda. - Let's end this thing once and for all, shall we? I control the elements with far more power than each and every one of you. - But I can do karate. [blows cracking] [Glenda groaning] - I don't have time for this. [Sky shouting] - [Sky] Crap! - Sky! - Glenda! [Flora screaming] - Flora! That's enough. - Oh yeah? [flame roaring] - [laughing] I defeat each with its own element. - Marina! [water bubbling] [flame hissing] [kick cracking] [Glenda groaning] - But not when we stand together. [magic rumbling] [Flame shouting] [Glenda laughing] - We need to get to the rose! - The magic belongs to us! - We need to get out of here! [Glenda laughing] [fountain booming] [Glenda shouting] - Huh? - Huh? - [Girls] Yes! - No! No, no! [girls laughing] Oh no, my powers. Oh no, my powers! - I'm afraid we have to ask you to leave our house. - What? - Hm. [glass shattering] [Glenda shouting] [water splashing] - Oh, is my lady taking a bath? - That did it. Now you can spend the rest of your life as a boar. - My lady, it is time to say farewell. Will you still be needing the car? - What? - No? - Huh? - Wonderful. - [Glenda] Oswald! [Glenda retches] [toad croaking] [Glenda retches] [toad croaking] [Glenda retches] [magic buzzing] [Baxter grumbling] - Hey, no panic, I'm on your side. - What is it you want here? - We'll talk soon, but right now I have to load Baxter with elf dust. - Absolutely no way. - Child, I used to work for your great grandfather. Kept up the house. [Baxter grumbling] Yeah, with Baxter's help. [Sky laughing] - That's true, she was his housekeeper. - And he gave her the hunting lodge as a present. - Oswald said she had nothing to do with Glenda. - I think Baxter is mega cool. - Children, it's urgent. The source closes when it wants. I have to go in there. - No, it only closes when the four sisters of the house aren't united. - Well, I'll be, that sounds right. That's how it was back then. - And you don't have to worry anymore on that account. - We actually never fight. - Not anymore. - We try. - We promise. [girls chattering excitedly] - Well, so you've all decided that you don't want to sell the house. [girls chattering excitedly] - The crazy woman cause the-- - And this time we all agreed. - [Girls] Yes. - But we can't just walk away from the contract. We've signed it. [flame roaring] [parents shouting] - Did you burn yourself? - No. - How can something like that happen? - I saw it on YouTube, spontaneous combustion. Happens more than you think. - [laughing] Yeah. [briefcase rattling] [toads croaking] - Toads instead of money? - Could've been worse. - Huh? - Could've been fleas or mice. - Huh? - I said it could've been fleas or mice. - Well, I would say this sale is null and void. - [Girls] Yes! - Here they come.
