[skateboard scraping] JACK: All I've ever wanted is for my family to be happy. Now, there are things that can take you away from that. Money, power, shit like that. There are few things that a man truly loves. That's his home. You know what I'm saying? That's his family. A real man does what he has to do to protect them. - Amen. - Amen. Now you see for the first time in a long time, I've got the people I love close to me. And I put them there. Not every man can say that he takes care of his own, that he bought a building and moved his entire family into it, and now he's paying the rent. And yes, maybe I've done things I'm not necessarily proud of to get them there. But you know what? If you are lucky, you survive. And so if there's even a glimpse of happiness out there, you do your best, and you hold onto that with two hands. ...y el Espiritu Santo, bendiga a estos fieles. En Jesucristo nuestro Señor. Amen. Yo, these are my cousins Hector and Manny, man. - Yo, how you doing, man? - Yo, man, what's up? My man, these dudes are crazy. When I was a kid, they used to come into my crib and like eat me out of house and home and shit, man. This dude was always eating, look at him. That's fantastic, man. Everybody in here is your family, like? Basically. Except for Sada right there. That baby Richie has is the cutest thing. So adorable! - That's a beautiful baby. - Gorgeous! Mami, did you see the cradle that I brought Richie and Rosa? You brought them a cradle? Yeah. Come upstairs, so I can show you. Nice. Oh, excuse me, Sada. Okay, okay. - Give this to me. - Hey, I'm only doing one. No, no! You've had enough. - It's my first beer. - You know how you get. - Coño, chica. - Don't embarrass me. Por el amor de Dios. - It's a surprise, Ma. - Okay. - A surprise. - Okay, okay. Mama, what are you doing up here all alone? Ah, it's just too noisy down there. I can't hear myself think. Well, then don't think. Go downstairs. Come on, go have some fun. Baby! Come on, where you been at? I was at work. I ran right over. I know, but you missed the cake. That's your favorite part. - Oh. You're my favorite part. - Oh, really? Wow. Looks so comfortable. I want to sleep in that thing. If you sleep in that, you won't be able to get up for work tomorrow morning to open the store, right? Right. Right, Dad. It's gonna be a beautiful life, right? [light chatter] All right, guys. Look at this. This is what a family's supposed to look like, guys. All right? Hey, Abuela. Good morning, young lady. Hey, you remember when you used to make us flan? Why you don't do that no more? Why don't you make some flan? What do I look like, your slave? Uh, okay. - Hey, hey. - Yeah? - Where's your father? - He's asleep, Ma. Drunken fool that he is, huh? Now stop it, all right? We're at breakfast. We're having a good time. He's sleeping it off upstairs. - Leave him alone. - He's always sleeping it off. Come on, Mami. Baby, you want to do something tonight? A movie, anything? I can't. I'm going out with some friends tonight. Yeah, all right. I bought this from Ping Lee over at the Korean joint. That looks like the shirt that Uncle Paulie gave me for Christmas. Oh, I remember that shirt. That was a fly-ass shirt. This looks nothing like that shirt. That looks exactly like that shirt, even the buttons. I don't know about no buttons. But this ain't that shirt. It looks like my shirt. Hey, Nadia, who was that girl in your apartment last night? Marie. Hmm. Marie. Who's Marie? It's a girlfriend of mine. What you mean, "girlfriend"? I mean girlfriend. No, but I mean like... Can I talk to you for a second? We'll be right back, Mom. - Jack. Jack, what? - Cut the bullshit, all right? - What bullshit? - You can't be fucking serious. Why are you making this into such a big deal, Jack? You're bugging out right now. Look, did you tell Mami about this shit? No, I didn't. Mami didn't ask, but if she asks-- Just do me a favor. Don't tell her, don't tell Papi. Don't tell anybody about this. Why are you telling me not to tell anybody? What's the problem? I don't understand. - What's the problem? Okay. - This is nothing. That's my girl. That's what it is, all right? - That's just your girl? - That's my girl. And that's what it is, and it's not a problem. And if they can't handle it, they can't handle it. But let them deal with it, all right? Good? Oh, yo, yo, yo. What up, what up, what up? Chillin', chillin'. Hold on. Full up in there, yo. - Yo, I saw the peeps on Sunday. - Oh, the family? The family is crazy. You know, the little one. Yo, that's the son. Yo, you're good, you're good. You're good. [humming] Ah, yeah. Oh, what's up, dawg? What the fuck is wrong with you? Put this shit inside your shirt. Hey, you know them? Nah. All right. How's business today? It's okay. You know, it's early. So I got you a little bit of that purple kush, and then I got you some Jesse's Girl. I know it. Put it up and knock 'em down. But never get no condoms, nasty motherfucker. - Hey, hombre. - What it is, baby? What's up? Yo, how much we take in today? 350. 350? Come on, man, you gotta do better than that shit. Yeah, well, it's early. It's early. Yo, who them dudes across the street? I don't know. What I do know, I did see him yesterday, though. Motherfuckers. - Yo, Jack. Bro! - Yo, man. - Spare me a 20, please, man? - Fuck is wrong with you, man? I got a watch for you, man. Spare me a 20, please. - I don't want your watch. - Come on, bro. Help me out. Yo, check it out, bro. Hold on. Check this out, bro. You can take my daughter and do whatever you want with her. Spare me a 20, my man. Yo, I'm serious, bro. You know? Yo, I got a spot back there, man. I'm telling you, you can do whatever you want, bro. I'm serious, man. Young and tight, man. I'm telling you. I've been there. I know. Okay. Yeah, okay, man. Let's do that shit. All right, my man! Come on, man. Come on, bro. Come on. Right here, man. Yo, you can do whatever you want, bro. - All right, yeah, yeah. - Anything man, yeah. - Really? - Yo, anything you want, bro. Enjoy, man. - Come here, mama. - It's cool, man. - You okay? - Yeah. You're okay, right? Okay. Come here. Motherfuck! Look at me right now. You hear me? Get the fuck down! You fucking like little girls? Huh? - [screams] - Right? Huh, motherfucker? You okay? [screaming] Look at me. I want you to look at me. Look at me. You see me? If you ever do some shit like that again, I'll fucking kill you. You hear me? - Answer me, motherfucker! - Yeah, yeah! Get the fuck out of here. Mama, come here. Hey, no, it's okay. Come here. You know me? You seen my face before? If he ever lays a hand on you, if he touches you, I want you to come and get me, you understand that? I'm in the bodega right around the corner. Okay? Sit the fuck down! You made me wait. - I did? - Mm-hmm. Oh, no. That's bad. How long? How long were you waiting? - About a half hour. - Oh, a half hour? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, my God. You gotta get me a key. Ah, this girl can't wait to move in, huh? Ay, you're such a slob. - Baby... - Look at this. After we get married, I'm gonna have this place organized. Oh, my God. This girl moves so fast. Oh, too fast? - You want to see what fast is? - You better be careful. That's $20 a feel baby. Ooh, she must have $20. Ooh, that's 40, baby. Why are you always such a businessman? Ooh, you better be careful. That's $60. I don't think you can afford that shit. That's okay. My boyfriend will pay for it. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. Okay. MAN (distant): Open the door! [distant shouting] [shouting continues] Tú lo llevas jodiendo la humanidad. Let me in the fucking door already! Stop making a big federal case out of this! Your mother's a crazy woman! She won't let me in the apartment! You will not enter my apartment! What are you talking about? What the fuck you talking about? - I got this, okay? Stop. - You're a drunken fool! Mama, please, I can handle it. You're a drunken fool! I live here too! My son moved me in here too. I don't want you here like that. Ma, please, come on! Mama Sada, I'm so sorry. Okay, listen to me. I promise that your neighbors aren't crazy, all right? It's not gonna happen again. Okay, Pop, let's go upstairs into my apartment, please. - Go, go! - Go! - I want to go to my house. - No! Go! - Go! Go! - No! Shoo! You're a drunken fool! It's your fault! It's all your fucking fault! You poisoned my fucking marriage! - Bull! - Shut up! Shut up! [shouting continues] - What are you looking at? - Pa, Pa, Pa, come on. I got this one. Your mother is a crazy woman. She's a crazy woman. Let's get you in here so you can sleep this off. I don't want to sleep it off. You know how long it took me to get like this? [mumbling] Uh-oh. What? Come on. Are you fucking kidding me, man? Dad! Did you just do that shit? My dick did it. [laughs] Come on, man. Stop. All right, come on. Let's go in the fucking bathroom and clean you up. - Oh, I don't wanna. - Papi, we're not dancing, man. Come on, chico. - [mumbling] - Just get yourself cleaned up. Get yourself out of those fucking pissy pants. Ayúdame, chico. Aren't you going to change me? Baby, I'm sorry, all right? You're gonna have to go home. My pop's staying tonight. Oh, that's fair. It's not about fair, baby. What you want me to say? Well, why can't he stay in the living room? Because, baby, I'm staying in the living room. - Let me pay for your cab, okay? - Then I can stay with you. Baby, stop, please. It's embarrassing enough you have to see my father like this. We can both sleep on the couch. Baby, look, I will see you tomorrow, okay? Tomorrow I might not be horny. Oh, really? You believe that shit? No. I guess not. All right, baby, I'm gonna see you tomorrow, okay? - I will see you tomorrow. - No, come on. I will call you later. I will make sure you got home safe, okay? Your floor's cold. You got any socks? Fucking shit, Pop! ¿Qué pasó? What's the matter? She's never seen a naked man before? [women chatting] And not only that, she's 6 months pregnant. - Can you believe this? - Oh, no. Oh, yes. What does Jose have to say about it? I know he must be upset. Jose has no idea. Jose thinks it's his child. Boy, is he gonna be surprised when that baby is born, and all of a sudden a black child as black as night comes out, huh? No entiendo. Y sé que lo tiene. Mira, yo la voy a llamar otra vez, para ver si me da el dinero que me debe, okey? No, mira, yo no estoy en welfare. Yo no estoy en welfare. Esa calda es una mentirosa. Una embustera, una paquetera. Me debe este dinero y no me lo quiere pagar. Por favor, nunca me... Excuse me, fellas. Gentlemen. - You talking to me, B? - Who the fuck you work for? Like I just said, you talking to me, my man? I'm talking to you. I know you ain't talking to me like that, son. Listen, man, I'm trying to be real cordial with you right now. Now I been working this street here for like five years. Where the fuck you get off working my beat, man? Your beat. Check this out, dude. I work for Chino, you feel me? - Chino? - Yeah. Okay, okay, okay. 138th Street Chino? That's right, motherfucker. You got a problem, you go deal with him. No, that's where you're wrong. I got a problem, and I'm getting with y'all niggas right now. I need you to get the fuck off my street. My dude, didn't I just tell you like a second ago you can't fucking talk to me like that? I'm gonna talk to whoever the fuck I want to. Yo, do you really hear yourself right now, B? Hey, yo, relax yourselves. You think you're ready to fuck with Chino? Think about it, eh? Listen to me, fellas. I need you to leave right now. You understand that shit? Get the fuck off my street and take your fucking loverboy with you, you feel me? Well, since we all cordial, and you need me to go, I'm gonna give you this one. Today. Let's get up out of here, B. Later, boys. Motherfucker. Let's get the fuck out of here. Excuse me, mama. I'm sorry. Where'd you just come from? And what business is that of yours? - Business? - Yeah. This is my fucking building. You're on my property. I was in Nadia's apartment. - You were at Nadia's? - Yeah. That's what I thought. Look... I don't want you coming here no more. Well, I'll ask Nadia about that. Nadia ain't got nothing to say about it, okay? Fine. Goodbye. Have a nice day, mami. Bitch. - Baby! - Mm? Baby, you got the suntan lotion? Yeah. Did you get the mosquito spray for your father? I don't know. I think my moms was at it. You better check. Mami? What? You got the mosquito spray for Papi? Since when do you remember your mother doing anything for me? - What did you say? - You heard me! You know, after everything I've done for you, you got a lot of nerve! See what you did, Jack? You see that? [shouting continues] - Please, fucking help me, man. - All right, I'll help. You're messing up the whole hill, man. Well, it's my day off. Day off? You need to go to the gym with your fat ass. Shut up. - Where were you last night? - I went out with my friends. You know Celeste, right? Yeah, I know Celeste, but that's not the point. What's the point? The point is that you're always going out. - You became this party girl. - What, I can't go out now? What, you gonna keep me in a cage? You want our marriage to work? Of course I want it to work. I'm just enjoying my life. Well, if you just wanted to enjoy your life, then maybe you shouldn't have gotten married. I was thinking after we get married, I'm gonna get us a new bedroom set. Baby, listen to me. We don't need a new bedroom set, okay? Your papa gave us that furniture years ago. It's fine. Yeah, it looks like an old man's bedroom furniture. It's tired. Listen to me. Does it work? Oh, Papi. You still got it. Hey, te acuerdas. Yo soy tremendo machote. Oh, well, I wouldn't go that far. Yeah, well, I'd go that far. [laughing] Don't let it swell your head. It's swelling. Ay, you're so nasty. I brought some chicken. You want some chicken? Oh, no, Abuela, thank you. You don't want any chicken? No, I'm good. What's the matter? My chicken's not good enough for you? No, Abuela, I didn't say that. You used to eat my chicken all the time when you were a kid. Now you're telling me you can't eat my chicken. What's the matter with it? Nothing's the matter with it. I'm not that hungry, that's all. You're not hungry? Yeah, no, I'm good. Oh, okay. You want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? What the fuck are you doing? Get that out of your mouth. - Yo, you gotta light it. - Give me that. Thank you, baby. - Mm-hmm. You know what? That futon's gotta go, too. [laughs] God. Listen, that futon is fine, okay, all right? With my family, I fucking need that shit. You would get a sofa that opens up to a bed. What are you doing? You're trying to change my whole life all of a sudden. What's going on? That's what married life is about. - Really? - Yeah. Let me talk to you for a second. - Go ahead. - Alone. No, it's okay. Anything you gotta say in front of me, you can say in front of Lily. All right. My girlfriend called me last night. - Not that shit. - She said you threw her out. What the fuck is wrong with you? You want the family to know you're a fucking dyke? Go fuck yourself. You got some nerve telling me that shit. I kicked her out. So what? I don't want her in there. Who are you to tell me who goes into my apartment? I'm the fucking landlord! I don't want any nasty characters in my building. That's the nastiest looking bitch I seen in my fucking life. You are not seriously telling me how to run my life, Jack. I'm not trying to run your life! I'm running my building. Okay, not a problem then. How about I leave? I'm trying to give you everything. A beautiful life close to your family, a free apartment. All you want to do is lick some bitch's pussy? That's what you fighting for? That's how you gonna do me, Nadia? Fuck that shit, man! Hey, dance with your mother, will you? Papi, please, man. I'm sorry. I'm not in the mood right now. What do you mean you're not in the mood? I should slap your face. Dance with your mother. Come on. You open that up, and I'll rip out your tongue. You and what army, vieja? Look, I'm tired of him. He's doing it because he cares about you. I don't care. He's making it about who lives in the building. What's going on here? You're having girl talk? Yeah, Abuela, just girl talk. That's good. What you talking about? Men? Uh, yeah. Okay. First things first. All men are animals. You can't trust them to save your life. Remember, women are smarter than men. We are the one who makes all the decisions. If they had been born without a dick, they would serve no purpose whatsoever. [laughs] You see that? Abuela understands. [laughing] I want you to do me a favor. I want you to fuck my sister. Your sister? You want me to fuck your sister? That's what you just said? You want me to fuck your sister? You kidding me, man? I thought you said she was on some gay shit anyway. Listen, it's not that I understand the lesbian shit. I just don't fucking believe in it, you feel me? - Okay. - How much of a dyke can you be you're still getting fucked with a plastic dick? [chuckles] Yeah. All I'm asking you to do is give her the real deal. Show her what she's missing. I don't mix business with pleasure, and I don't shit where I lay. Motherfucker, you acting like I'm asking you to do work. I'm asking you to fuck my sister! - [sighs] - I'm talking to you. What the fuck is this shit? - Take her out! - Jack! Take her to the fucking movies. I don't care. I'll pay for the shit. I'll give you the fucking money. Jackie, what's up? Hey, Manny! Yo, Manny! - Manny! - Yeah, bro. What's up, bro? I'm looking in my closet for my light blue shirt, - and it ain't there. - What do you want? You want me to help you find it? No, I don't want you to help me! What, my shirt just fucking mysteriously disappears? What do you know about that? Man, I don't know shit about it. I keep it in the same closet, Manny, right by my vests. Well, did you look in that same closet? What do you think? I'm assuming that you probably did. - Manny, give me my shirt. - Man, no, sorry. I ain't got shit that you want, man. You're my brother. I love you. I would never steal from you like that. - [dog barking] - Shit, the dog's barking. Fucking Judge Joe Brown is on. Peace, yo! [barking continues] Did you hear about that guy who got arrested - around the corner last night? - No, who? Some guy. They were chasing him down the street. There were some drugs. Oh, I don't know. You know that young guy that bought the building around the corner? You know, the one that moved all his family in? Oh, yeah. What about him? How do you think he made all his money to buy that building? He's a drug dealer. No kidding. Really? I thought he owned a bodega. Yeah, he owns a bodega, but I mean, come on. How often have you seen anybody come out of that place with a loaf of bread or a carton of milk? LILY: What are you thinking about? Hmm? What are you thinking? Um... I don't know, baby. Seems like you got something serious on your mind. Yeah, well, you know, I do, kind of. So spit it out. It's not like I don't already know what it is. Oh, really? You know what it is? All right, so why don't you tell me again. You don't want to get married, do you? Okay. I'm not ready. Then why did you ask me in the first place? Because I love you, all right? That's great. I already bought a wedding gown. What? Why would you do that shit? Baby, we haven't even set a date yet. I couldn't help it. I saw a beautiful white gown, and I fell in love with it. White? With all the boyfriends you had, you bought a white dress? - You're not funny. - [laughs] Oh, man. Why didn't you tell me before that you weren't ready? What do you want me to tell you? I wasn't ready. I don't know. I guess I should give you your ring back. Now stop that. Stop that bullshit. Baby, stop. Put the ring back on your finger, okay? Look, I still love you. I just-- I don't think I'm ready to get married right now. That's it. Honestly, I don't even think I even know what marriage means. All right, look. Honestly, what's the difference between us the way we are right now and us if we were married, hmm? - None, Jack, okay? - Exactly. None at all. - All right. - [knocking] [knocking] [knocking] Who is it? It's your mother. Hey. Come in, come in. What's going on, Ma? It's like 2:00 in the morning. Oh, yeah, I know. What's going on? What, is Papi okay? What? Your father's fine. [sighs] I was at the Laundromat, and I heard these two women. They were talking about you. You're a drug dealer? Hmm? I just stood there, frozen in my shoes. I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to do. I... I want you to look at me in the eye. I want you to look at me in the eye, and I want you to answer me truthfully. Are you a drug dealer? I'm not a drug dealer, Mami. I'm asking you. Answer me! Are you a drug dealer? Okay, no. No. Do you believe me? - Okay. Can I have a hug now? - Okay. - Okay. All right. - Okay. That's what I wanted to hear. Listen to me. You gotta stop listening to those people in the Laundromat. They don't know what they're talking about, okay? They're just jealous of what we got going on here. - You understand that? - Yeah. - You understand that? - Yes. Okay? You're not gonna scream at me no more? No. - Well, I may scream-- - You might scream a little. Give me a kiss. - All right? I love you. - I love you, too. - You look sexy in your bata. - Oh, shut up. - Go put a shirt on. - Okay. I'm sorry. It's okay. 'Night. All right. Martha! Where's my wallet? Martha! - What?! - My wallet, where is it? Martha! - I have your wallet! - Give it here. No! It's mine now. What do you mean, it's yours? Give me my wallet. Irresponsible! You're going to the bar, spending money we don't even have! - Give me my wallet! - No! It's mine! I'm the one who works in this house! I bust my ass at the airport! I'll spend money any way I want! He's a bum. Throw him out. Mama, you stay out of this. I can handle this on my own. Once, just once I'd like to have a fight just you and me and not your cabrona madre. You're a bum, and you'll always be a bum. Mama, please! You're a bum, and you'll always be a bum. You think after all these years of being married, you'd learn how to think for yourself. Everything that comes out of your mouth comes from her! ¿No es verdad? ¿Vieja? Oh, look, she's asleep. Oye... Mama? Mama? Call 911. All right, so what's going on? You okay? Do I look like I'm okay? You know what she said to me right before she died? She called me a bum. Well, you know, Pop, it's Abuela. What else she gonna say? Maybe she's right. So what is this? Is this gonna be some kind of regular thing now? Why don't you just tie a ball and chain to my leg? Believe me, I'm not so far from doing that. I mean, what's the matter? You used to like sitting at home with me. Now every fucking night, you gotta go out. - It is not every night. - It is every night, Rosita. You know, what about me you can't fucking stand? [cell phone ringing] This is fucking boring, all right? Boring? Uh, hey! What are you doing? Hello? Hello? You think I'm fucking stupid? - You're staying home tonight. - Oh, really? Who says? Your fucking husband says so, all right? Yeah, okay, all right. You know what? Watch me leave. - Leave? Come here. - Ow! What? What are you gonna do, you gonna hit me now, huh? You gonna hit me? Go ahead. Fucking hit me. [door slams] Shit, man. Hey, Jack, so I heard about your abuela, and I just wanted to make the time to say I'm sorry. I appreciate that, man, but what you gonna do, right? - Life goes on. - Yeah, I guess. So it's good. You ready to go out with my sister yet? Shut the fuck up about that shit, man. I already told you fuck no, man. Stop asking me already, dawg. Yeah, I'll fuck her if you want. Hey, yo, watch your fucking mouth. - What? - There you go. Thank you, I appreciate it, but no, thank you. It's 'cause I'm a brother, right? But if I was a little dick Spanish motherfucker, you wouldn't have shit to say about it, right? I don't know about that little dick shit, man. - Fuck you, man. - Hey, yo. What the fuck? Yo, fuck that shit, man. Hey, what's happening, brother? - Hey, what's up? - What the fuck you doing here? What you mean, what I'm doing here, huh? You're on my block. You think I'm fucking blind? Hey, listen, Chino said you got a beef with him, you can go speak to him. But you don't own this fucking street. That's what Chino said? Where the fuck he at, nigga? Oh, he at Louie's Bar. Be there in about 20 minutes. All right. - Louie's fucking bar? - Louie's Bar, baby. - 20 minutes? - 20 minutes. All right, homey. See you there. Let's do this fucking shit. 'Bye, boys. Yo, Jack, where fuck you at? I'm gonna get my fucking hammer, motherfucker. Aw, shit. Jack, Jack, I gotta talk to you. - Richie, I'll be here tomorrow. - Just for a second, bro. - Just not right now. - I just need a minute. Just give me a second, bro, please. I can't deal with shit with you right now, man. Come on, please? Baby, what are you doing here? I asked your mother to let me in. I figured she'd still be upset about your abuela, so I'm making dinner for everybody tonight. What's going on? Nothing, baby. You're here again. Excuse me? I'm just saying every time I come home, you're here. Baby, we're not married yet. Richie, get the fuck off me. Jack, please. - Bro, we gotta go. - Get the jam. What did he say? Jack, I need to talk to you. I can't deal with this shit with you right now! I understand, but it's just one minute. It's important, man. Yeah, all right. Come on. Hurry the fuck up. Come on, come on, come on. Listen, bro, you're like the only person that I could talk to about this, I'm telling you. How do you-- - Jackie, Jackie, listen. - Yes, I can talk. This is serious, man. This is serious. Richie, what is it, man? You gonna say some shit, say it, man. What? Rosa's cheating on me. What? Yeah, man. She's cheating on me, bro. What the fuck you mean she's cheating on you? - You talk to her about this? - She won't talk to me, Jackie. You know this. What you mean she won't talk to you, man? - [knocking] - WILLIE: Yo, Jack, come on. Richie, I can't talk to you about this right now, all right? - I'm sorry. - Please, bro, listen.

This nigga can't tell his face from his fucking asshole. Jack, please put the gun back. Put the fucking gun back. Please! Jack, please put the gun back! All right, now you need to remember that, okay? 'Cause that shit might have been the only thing making sure I was coming back here tonight. Remember that. Jack. Jack! Take the gun. What? Oh, you can't be fucking serious, man. [door closes] I don't want no trouble, you hear me? I hear you, man. I hear you. I just want you to know that you don't own that fucking street. Nobody does. See, thing is I've been working that street a long time. That fucking street is big enough for the both of us. Right, but, dawg, you know I was there first. That's not the point, homeboy. The point is that we're in this together now, and if we don't want anything bad between us, we're gonna have to learn how to get along. Am I right or wrong? No, yeah, man, you right, you right. So let's settle this bullshit. Let's keep it simple. How's this sound? I'll have the northwest side of the street. You have the southeast side of the street. No. All right, how's this? I get a gun, I shoot all you motherfuckers' heads off, and I take the rest of the street for me? - Fuck you! - [laughs] Jack, we're either gonna work this out, or we're gonna kill each other. The choice is up to you. How would you like it if I started working on Willis Avenue? Hey, man, that's why I'm in your area now, 'cause 138th is crowded. People coming from all over. What am I supposed to do? I could either kill somebody or let 'em work, right? You hear me, amigo? Yeah, I hear you, man. There's always a way to work something out, brother. Todo está bien, socio, ¿verdad? Yeah, man. Okay. You don't sound too good about that. I'm not gonna turn around one day and find a bullet in my back, right? Nah, I don't work like that. All right, bro. Don't work too hard. All right. Appreciate it. The pleasure's all mine. Baby, are you okay? Okay. [door opens] Hell yes. What the fuck are you doing in here? I'm having a drink. Why do you have my leather on? How did you get into my... You son of a bitch! You're stealing my clothes! Wait, wait, wait! It's not what it looks like. - Then what the fuck is it? - Uh, I usually bring them back. No, you son of a bitch! You made me think I was going crazy! You were stealing my clothes the entire time! But I'm not stealing them. I fucking wear them-- - [screams] - Oh, oh. I'm sorry. No, no, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - What'd I do? What'd I do? - [crying] Don't cry. Oh, fuck. What did I do? You fucking fractured my wrist! - Yo, what? - Fuck you. [Hector and Manny continue shouting] [door slams] All right, so... Sure you don't want to stay over? I got some stuff to think about. I'll see you tomorrow? I don't know. Hey, Lily! Come on, man. What are you doing, Pop? I'm going to my apartment. What do you think I'm doing? Well, you're crazy if you let Mami see you like this. What's the matter with you? Are you stupid or something? You think I go out and get drunk on payday? The best part of it is coming home and watching your mother go crazy. Gonna take that away from me? All right there, Pop. You do this on purpose? How the fuck else am I gonna get her attention, eh? Stop the fucking shit. People are sleeping. Come up to my apartment with me. - No. - Please, man, do it for me. Just come up with me. All right. And whenever I try to fuck her now... Shit. Come on, I don't wanna hear about this shit. It's true. We used to fuck three or four times a day. Dad, stop. Your mom, when I was young, let me tell you. She used to jump on me and ride me like a horse. All right. Will you stop talking about sex? I don't need that shit in my life. Really. You don't need that in your life? How do you think you were born? Your brother, your sister. How do you think they got here? I don't know, man. I don't really think about that shit. Help me, Jack. [grunts] You know... I remember the day you were born like it was yesterday. - Yeah? - Yeah. You were so tiny and pink. I remember the nurse said she had never seen a baby so, so tiny and pink. When are you and Lily gonna give your mother a grandbaby? You got a beautiful girlfriend. What's happening with you two? You still gonna get married? She wants to. I don't. [chuckles] I understand that. I don't know. What don't you know? Dime. Scared of turning into you. ¿Qué? I don't want to be a mess. I don't want to be a fucking drunk and sad and alone and unhappy, man. I don't... I don't want to be fucked up like you. Hmmph. Fucked up. You're not fucked up. You're a great son. I mean, look at you. Look at what you've done. If I saw Richie, Nadia and you once every couple of months, I was lucky. Now I see you every day. Every fucking day. See? That's it. You don't-- That's what I'm talking about. What... What happened with us, man? I mean, when we were kids, Richie and Nadia and I, man, like in the wintertime, we'd go out, and we'd play. And Hector, man, he'd come over, and we'd be throwing snowballs at each other, and... then we'd go inside, and Mami would have some hot chocolate waiting for us or some shit, and Grandma would make some flan. And then you'd come home. And you'd have some type of lame-ass present for us. I don't know. You know, I wouldn't really know what it was. It would be anything. It could be a fucking stick of gum. But you'd have something, you know? And we knew that. There were some days that, that were not so good. You don't know what it's like for me. I think me and Marta may have run our course. You know what I mean, Jackie? It's time to get off the track, you know? You talking about leaving Mami? I wouldn't just get up and leave. I'd do it all legal-like, so she'd still get money from my pension and all that. [sighs] I think it's time to just... let things run their natural course. Are you kidding me? You have any idea how hard I've worked to put this family back together? No, man, you don't. I'm fucking tired. I am tired, man. So no, I won't let you or anybody else just fuck this shit up for me. We're gonna have a fucking beautiful life if I have to fucking kill somebody. [snoring] [women chatting] All night. So she's gotta get up early in the morning at 5 a.m. and put the bag over the baby's face and let it breathe, and she's wondering, "I feel so bad about myself." - She's worried about herself. - Are you-- She's gotta get up early to put a mask over... Esa niña tiene 14 años. El viejo, 35 años. [chatter continues] You know, you people should be ashamed of yourselves. You have nothing better to do with your time than talk bad about other people? Did you ever look in the mirror? Did you ever look at yourselves? You know, you people are pretty pathetic. You are not perfect. Not by a long shot, baby. So give it up. Give up the garbage. All of you! All right. All right, what's going on? What is it? I'm pregnant. You did that shit on purpose? - What? - Hmm? You did that shit on purpose because I told you I wasn't gonna marry your ass. Are you serious right now? I'm not gonna get forced into any of this shit. Forced? What, you think you're God's gift to me? I gotta force you to marry me? Fuck you! You gonna tell me you didn't plan any of this shit? Are you out of your fucking mind? Why would I want to get pregnant from you? - You, a drug dealer! - Lower your voice. A fucking drug dealer! A drug dealer! Watch that fucking mouth! You think I want that for my kid? Stop the fucking bullshit. The fuck is wrong with you? The money's not good enough for you? What's the matter? You don't like getting your bills fucking paid, baby? Fuck you! That's good enough for that shit, right? I'm not marrying anybody, baby. Did I just ask you to marry me? You're always asking me to marry you. I'm talking about right now. Did I ask anything from you? You know what? I don't want your baby. I wouldn't have your baby if you paid me a million dollars! You see that shit? How the fuck I know money was gonna get into this conversation? I don't want your money! I don't want nothing from you, okay? I'll have an abortion! Oh, really? You know what? Matter of fact, great. I'm gonna pay for the shit. Here you go. Yeah, look, one... I don't want shit from you. Two. You know what? Take the fucking whole shit. Keep your fucking money! I can't believe you're saying this shit to me right now. After everything I've done for you? When are you gonna stop lying? Will you stop it already? Stop with your fucking shit. When are you gonna tell your mother what you do for a living? - Watch your fucking mouth! - When is that gonna happen? You want the whole neighborhood to know my business? They probably already fucking know! - Shut the fuck up! - Don't fucking touch me! Fuck! You ever think about how much I lie for you, huh? One more time. Watch your fucking mouth. All right, you gonna do this shit in front of me now, too? Jack, stop. I'm serious. You're serious? Bitch, you're fucking delirious. Jack, leave her alone. It's not your business. You shut the fuck up, too. This is my business. - Hey, you got a lot of nerve-- - Jack, come on, stop. - What? You gonna close the door in my face, bitch? - Huh? - Jack. - All right! - Jack, come on! Hey, Nadia, get the fuck out here, bitch! Hey, you fucking dyke! You pussy-licking slut! - Come out your fucking window! - What the fuck are you doing? You wanna humiliate me in front of everybody? Well, now you've done that. So just leave me alone already! That's what you are, right? A fucking dyke bitch. Let the neighborhood know! Jack, you're a fucking lowlife bitch. That's what the fuck you are, little fucking pussy bitch. I'm a lowlife, bitch? I'm giving you everything here! I didn't ask you for shit, motherfucker! What the fuck is wrong with you? I'm trying to build a beautiful life for our family again. This is how you fucking treat me? Get the fuck out of here! Come on! The only fucking shit was beautiful for you, motherfucker, 'cause you were a fucking baby, 'cause everybody always fucking did what the fuck you wanted. And that's what's fucking you up, right? You need to grow some fucking balls, motherfucker! Grow the fuck up! - Shut the fuck up, bitch! - Grow the fuck up! Bitch, you're living in my fucking house! Grow up? You go for another bitch? Fuck you! Suck a dick! Yeah, you suck my dick, motherfucker. Get the fuck up here and start sucking my dick, faggot-ass! Get out now! Get the fuck out or I will kick you-- - Get out of my apartment! - Bitch! Get the fuck off of me! Look, I told you! Jack, stop. Jack! [all shouting] Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off! Get the fuck off me! All right, get the fuck off! Calm the fuck down! Let me fucking talk! You know what the problem is? You're a fucking slut. You're a spoiled fucking slut getting fucked by fucking sluts. Oh, me? What the fuck about you, motherfucker? Every fucking thing gotta be the way you want it. You're a selfish little bitch, Jack. Selfish? I'm fucking selfish? I'm fucking selfish? That's why everybody's fucking living here for free, right? Yo, you're fucking delusional. Nobody is fucking happy here. Mom and Pop aren't fucking happy. Look at Lily. Look at your own girl. You can't see what is in front of your own fucking face. Yo, the most fucked-up shit out of all this is that out of all the people here, I never thought that you would be the one to do that shit to me, Jack. Just walk it off. Get the fuck off me. Don't fucking touch me. Jack... Fuck. [door slams] You gotta be fucking kidding me with this bullshit, man. This ain't enough. You gotta do better than that. I got bills to pay. Jack, it's harder with fucking Chino out there now. Things ain't the way they used to be. Ain't nothing the way it fucking used to be, man, all right? We gotta do some shit. We do whatever we gotta do. Work harder, longer hours, whatever, all right? All right, Papa, let me tell you something, man. I can tell you that you still angry with me. What the fuck are you talking? I'm not fucking angry at you. - Get the fuck outta here. - 'Cause I'm pretty sure-- Both of you, get the fuck outta here. Shit! MARTHA: You wanna leave, too? Good riddance. Good riddance. Get the hell out of here. Who needs you? Who needs you here to ruin my life? [glass shatters] I don't need you here! Go! CARLOS: I'm getting out! Gladly! [Richie and Rosa arguing] Don't fucking push me, Rosa. I'm serious. Stay here. You better fucking stay here. I'm going out tonight and that's that. - Rosa! - Stop whining! When did you become so needy? You sound like a fucking baby. Because of you my family thinks I'm a fucking pussy! - It's you, all right? - Oh, it's my fault! Why don't you be a fucking man? Man up, huh? Own some responsibility, okay? I have to take care everything. Fine. If you go out, I'm going out, too. Who's gonna stay with the baby? I'm gonna leave the baby with your mother, huh? 'Cause you can't handle your responsibilities as a father. You can't handle your responsibilities as a father! Don't, Rosita! Think about the baby. Richie, what about the baby? You're pushing me over the edge. This is your last warning. Richie, I am here with the baby every fucking day, okay? Rosa, I am fucking begging you. Listen to me. I am not fucking crazy. Come here. Come here, please! Please, baby! Please! Please, Rosa! Listen, listen. Wait, no, look. I don't wanna fight. I just gotta tell you... I love you. Does that mean anything to you? - Get your-- - Please. Please, Rosa. Richie, Richie, Richie, Richie! This is not a prison, okay? I'm not your fucking prisoner! [baby crying] - Fuck. - [door slams] Oh, my God. [knocking] Who is it? RICHIE: It's me, Jackie. Richie, what the fuck you want, man? I need to talk to you for a second. Come on, man. [knocking] - What? - Rosa's going out again. What kind of mother leaves her baby at home like that every night? I know she's seeing somebody, Jackie. I know it. Richie, what you want me to do about her? I don't know. [sobs] I don't know. There's nothing I can do! There's nothing I can do! What the fuck is wrong with you, man? Richie, man the fuck up, nigga! What the fuck you doing? I fucking need your help! That's what I wanna see! - Fuck, man! - There you go! That's what I wanna fucking see! That's what I wanna fucking see! Be a fucking man, my nigga! Hold onto your fucking life! Grow the fuck up and be a fucking man! You think you're the only one with problems in this world? You're a fucking bitch, man! Look at you crying like a bitch! You're supposed to be my big fucking brother, nigga! - Man the fuck up! - [crash] [Richie sobs] [door opens, closes] ROSA: Yeah, I shouldn't be home later than that. He should sleep real good tonight. You have my cell. MARTHA: Come on. Go have some fun. ROSA: Thank you so much. I appreciate this. What are you doing here, Jack? I'm sorry. All right? I should have never talked to you like that. Baby, I got angry, and I was being stupid, and then you know how I get when I get angry. I want to have the baby. Jack, I don't think we're ready for this. I'm ready, baby. It's time for me to man the fuck up. - I don't know, Jack. - Hey, come here. I love you, you understand? I was being stupid. I was being stupid, and I was an idiot, okay? And I was trying to fill a fucking void in my life with my family and that fucking building. You were trying to fill that void. I didn't let you, and I'm sorry, okay? I want to love you. Baby, I want to marry you, and I want to have that baby, and I want us to be a family, you understand? You understand? Coño, Jackie, I thought you'd never get here. Why? What happened? There's something wrong with Richie. Wouldn't talk to us. He said he just wants to talk to you. He's acting crazy. - All right, man. Where is he? - He's in your bedroom. Fuck is he doing in my bedroom? Why isn't he in his apartment? That's what we're trying to tell you. He's acting weird. He said he wanted to stay here until you got home. He locked himself up in your bedroom. - Okay. - He's acting nuts. Okay, Mami. I'll take care of it, all right? Well, go. Richie? RICHIE: Jack? Jack, is that you? Yeah, it's me. Open the fucking door, man. Stop playing with yourself. What is this shit, man? What the fuck's going on? I did it. I was a complete fucking man tonight, Jack! Hey. - I did it, Jack. - Richie... - I did it, Jack. - What are you talking about? I did it, Jack. I killed her... What? - She was cheating on me. - Richie, what did you do? Jack, she was cheating on me. She was doing it. She was doing it... but I got her. - I got her, Jack. I got her. - Hey, hey. I got her and the fucking bastard she was fucking, Jack. I told you she was doing it, Jack! I told you she was doing it. - Hey, look at me. - I told you she was doing it. Look at me. What did you do? I killed her. I was a man. I was a man tonight, Jack, and I fucking killed her. I killed them both, Jack. Do you hear me? Hey, I need you to listen to me for a second. - Jack! Jack! - Richie! - Anybody see you do this shit? - I don't know. But I was a fucking complete man tonight, Jack. I was a man tonight, Jack! Focus for a second, kid! Anybody fucking see you do this shit? I don't know. I don't know. How am I supposed to fucking know? How am I supposed to fucking know? How am I supposed to fucking know, Jack? Am I? Uh... Jack? Jack... Hey, let me talk to you for a second? ¿Qué pasa? I'm gonna go talk to Jack, okay? Do me a favor. I need you to get Mami downstairs, okay? Just take her downstairs. Tell her everything's fine. Tell her he's just fucking drunk or some shit, okay? Whatever you gotta say, I don't give a fuck. What happened? He's, uh... He killed Rosa. Mami, let's go downstairs. Everything's okay. It's just-- It's Richie. He's just freaking out again. It's nothing. Are you sure? He looked very strange. No, Ma, it's nothing. It's just Richie. He's just freaking out again. Is Jack in? He's kind of busy right now. Actually, Nadia, we have to talk to him. You can't come talk to him right now. Yo. What's going on, fellas? Jack, it's important. It's really important. All right, listen, I can't deal with this shit right now, okay? Take her downstairs. - Are you sure he's all right? - Mami, I'm positive, all right? He's a little twisted. You know how Richie gets sometimes. - Okay. - Okay? [door closes] Jack, your brother killed Flea tonight. Who the fuck is Flea? He's Chino's homeboy, man, his top gun. Motherfucker that be wearing that dumb-ass hat. He's Chino's cousin. Fuck! Are you sure? Listen, man, Chino wants to talk to you, man. He's at Louie's Bar. That's what he told me. You kidding me? I can't go down there right now. Yo, he's serious man. He wants to see you right now. All right, all right. Do me a favor. Get my sister. Go get my fucking sister, please? I can't leave this kid fucking here alone. Then we'll go down, we'll see what that motherfucker wants. Ain't no we, man. 'Cause he wants to talk to you alone. Alone? Are you crazy, man? I ain't going down there alone. He says if he sees any one of us near that place, he's gonna kill all of us. All of us. - Hey. - I did it, Jack. - Richie, did you take my gun? - I did it. Did you take my fucking gun? I... I threw it out. I threw it in the incinerator near Cypress Ave., near Cypress Ave. I had to get rid of the evidence, Jack. - Fuck. - Jack, no. Jack! [jukebox playing hip-hop] Bitch! Yo, this motherfucker ain't packing, B. Sit down. Chino, man, look, this whole shit was a mistake. Your life is a mistake, motherfucker! Look, my brother caught his wife cheating on him. You gonna try to tell me this had nothing to do with us? This had nothing to do with us! You must think I'm the stupidest motherfucker on Earth. No, Chino, man, I don't. I'm saying you got it twisted right now. You got it wrong. I asked you, Jack, I asked you if I was gonna turn around and get a bullet in my back. I asked you, motherfucker, and you said no. All right, look, look, this whole thing is just one big fucking misunderstanding, okay? This had nothing to do with you or me, okay? My deal with you is still good. My deal with you is still cool, man. Flea was my cousin. Did you know that, bro? I didn't, I didn't. I know that shit now. But what I'm trying to tell you is that this was an accident. This was an accident, and it had nothing to do with you and me. Then who did it have to do with, homeboy? This was between my brother and your cousin, all right? Your cousin was fucking around with my brother's lady. My brother dealt with it. It's as simple as that. He didn't know about any of this. Okay. We're gonna do this like this. A life for a life. Your brother killed my cousin. Now we kill your brother. I'm sorry, Chino, man. That's not gonna happen. A life for a life, homeboy. Nope. A life for a life. I want you to turn over your brother. All right, look. All this shit, okay, this ain't gonna bring your cousin back. All right, motherfucker? This ain't gonna solve anything. It'll solve it for me. It'll solve it for me, chief. That way we'll keep it even, and we'll keep the peace. That's not happening. You feel me? Look, you can have the block. You can have all that shit. I don't give a fuck. I don't want it anymore. It's 10:45. If you don't turn in your brother by midnight, we'll raid your fucking building, bro. I'm not fucking around. I will kill your mother, your father, your sisters, your children. I don't give two shits. I'll kill everybody in that motherfucking building, and you'll see if I'm fucking around. Jackie. My energy is coming down so fast. It's like I took some crazy drug or something. Richie, do you know who you killed today? Yeah. My friends were telling me. Some drug guy. That son of a bitch was fucking my wife. Fucking bastard! - [ring clatters] - [sniffles] You know they're looking for you? Yeah, I could imagine. Cops probably figured it all out, too. Maybe I should get out of here. Nadia said that you could give me some money. Maybe I'll go to Canada or something, you know? Richie, listen to me. It's not that easy, kid. - But... - Okay? - I can... - You killed two people today. - Okay? - [sobs] It's not that easy just to get up and walk away. I was being a man, Jackie. Just like you said. I was being a man. For the first time in my life, I was being a man, Jackie. Richie, I was wrong. You hear me? I was wrong. I was wrong about all that shit. No, no. I was wrong about you being a man. I was wrong about buying this fucking building. Everything. You hear me? No, you wasn't! I know what you was trying to do, Jackie. Keep the family together, right? Keep the family together. Richie, I gotta tell you something. - Jackie, I gotta go. - I need you to listen to me. Jackie, I gotta go. Please! Just lend me some money. Shut the fuck up for a minute. Richie, I need you to shut up. I need you to listen to me, okay? Okay? Sure. Look, Richie... there are men right outside this building right now with guns, waiting to kill you. [crying] Oh, God! I gotta get away, Jack! Listen to me for a second. I need you to pay attention. If I don't hand you over to them by 12:00, Richie, they're gonna come into this building... No, no, no, no. Jackie, please, no. ...they're gonna kill us. - No. - All of us. That means Mami. Yes. That means Papi. [Richie crying] - The baby, Richie, the baby. - My baby? Taking my baby? Taking my baby, Jackie... What do you want me to do? Just tell me what you want me to do. Tell me. You want me to go down there? I don't know. I don't know, Rich. Sometimes you gotta take responsibility for your actions. Whatever you say. You're the smart one. Stop, stop, stop, Rich. Come on, man, stop. What, Jackie? I don't know what I was thinking, man. Look at me. I'm gonna take care of this shit, okay? I'm gonna fucking take care of this shit, you understand? Okay. I'm gonna handle this. I love you, Jackie. I love you. I'm sorry. Goodbye, Jackie. Fucking shit! Get back here, Richie! Richie! Richie! Stop! - Richie! - [gunshots] [gunshot] PRIEST: Do you take this man to be your husband? LILY: Yes, I do. PRIEST: Do you take this woman to be your wife? Repeat after me. With this ring, I thee wed. JACK: With this ring, I thee wed. LILY: With this ring, I thee wed. Then by the power invested in me by God and his son Jesus, our savior, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. Any and all ladies who want to come and test their luck, step right on up, it's bouquet time. WOMEN: Ohh! I guess you get him back, Nadia. I guess. Baby! Aww... [music continues] [music stops] Hey, what's with the music? Let's have some music. What kind of wedding is this? A wedding's a celebration, eh? Full of possibilities! Let's have first dance from the bride and groom. Come on! Lily, Jack! Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Jack Maldonado. A big hand for the bride and groom! Come on! Come on, everybody! - I love you. - I love you too, Mami. [laughter] Thank you very much. I needed that. NADIA: I'm moving out tomorrow. JACK: I'm gonna miss you. NADIA: I'll miss you, too.
