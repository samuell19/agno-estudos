Man: ON JUNE 8th, 1712, THE SANTA CRUZ, FLAGSHIP OF SPAIN'S LUCRATIVE GALLEON TRADE, LEFT BARCELONA HEADED FOR THE NEW WORLD. - [ grunting ] - [ shouting in Spanish ] SLEEK AND FAST, SHE CROSSED THE ATLANTIC IN RECORD TIME. BUT AS THE SANTA CRUZ NEARED THE NEW WORLD, SHE ENCOUNTERED A STORM AT SEA, THE LIKES OF WHICH THE CREW HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE. TERRIBLE WIND AND WAVES POUNDED THE VESSEL, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO NAVIGATE. [ yelling in Spanish ] FOR DAYS THE CREW SAILED ON, OBLIVIOUS TO THEIR COURSE. THE DOOMED SHIP FOUNDERED ON AN UNCHARTED REEF AND QUICKLY DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE WAVES... TAKING THE ENTIRE CREW WITH HER. IT IS RUMORED THAT THE SANTA CRUZ CARRIED PRICELESS DIAMONDS AND JEWELS-- THE CROWN JEWELS OF THE SPANISH MONARCHY. I CAN'T PROMISE YOU GUYS WE'RE GONNA FIND ANY DIAMONDS DOWN THERE, BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU A BEAUTIFUL DIVE IF YOU PAY ATTENTION TO A FEW SIMPLE RULES. IT'S IMPORTANT WE STAY TOGETHER AT ALL TIMES AND LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER. WHEN WE DIVE AND EXPLORE THE OCEAN, IT'S POTENTIAL WILDERNESS ADVENTURE, BUT IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT WE COMMUNICATE. ARE YOU THREATENING US, FLYBOY? IT'S YOUR DIME, PAL. MISTAKES DOWN THERE CAN GET YOU KILLED. I'M JUST WARNING YOU. WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS, YOU'RE BORING US SILLY. - Woman: TYLER, PLEASE. - WHAT? WE GOT YOU, MR. WAGNER. OKAY, IGOR, WE'RE COMING CLOSE. BRING US DOWN. - FIVE MINUTES. - OKAY. IGOR? YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME. WHAT, DID DR. FRANKENSTEIN TAKE THE DAY OFF? - [ laughing ] - HE'S RELIABLE AND HE'S REASONABLE. LET'S HIT THE DRINK, BABE. I COULD USE ONE ABOUT NOW. THIS IS TYLER'S IDEA OF CELEBRATING OUR ANNIVERSARY. Tyler: COME ON, RILEY. YOU KNOW A LITTLE ADVENTURE ALWAYS SPICES UP THE MARRIAGE. - YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID ON OUR FIRST ANNIVERSARY? - WHAT? WE GOT CERTIFIED TO BE DIVERS. I GAVE RILEY A CHOICE THIS WEEKEND. IT WAS EITHER SCUBA DIVING, OR A MARATHON OF MUD WRESTLING AND HOT, STEAMY SEX. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY I AM HERE. THREE MINUTES. YOU BETTER LOSE THAT TRINKET BEFORE WE GO DIVING. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH THIS COST? JUST DO IT, OKAY? I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO BE TOO APPETIZING TO THE MARINE LIFE DOWN THERE. AYE AYE, MR. COUSTEAU. OKAY, WE JUMP OUT HERE AT CAPE DEL ORO, WE DIVE DOWN ABOUT 100 FEET, WE SWIM WEST ABOUT 150 METERS TOWARD THE VESSEL, AND THEN THE VESSEL'S RIGHT ABOUT HERE. THE WATER'S GONNA BE REALLY MURKY, SO IT'S IMPORTANT WE STAY REALLY CLOSE TOGETHER. COMMUNICATION IS VERY IMPORTANT. YOU'RE AN EX-NAVY MAN, MR. WAGNER? YEAH, SEALS. JUST TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET NOW. IT SUCKS TO BE YOU, DOESN'T IT? - TYLER, PLEASE. - WHAT? HEY, DAD, ARE THEY PAYING YOU ENOUGH MONEY TO PUT UP WITH THIS JERK? - NOT HARDLY. - I DIDN'T THINK SO. YOUR MOM COST ME MORE WHEN WE SPLIT UP THAN SHE DID WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER. - YEAH, I KNOW. I'M SORRY. - DON'T BE. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. WE'RE JUST HERE TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. STICK WITH ME. OKAY. I TELL YOU WHAT, HOW ABOUT NEXT TIME WHEN WE GET TOGETHER FOR THE WEEKEND, - WE JUST GO TO DINNER AND CATCH A BALLGAME? - DEAL. - [ beeping ] - Igor: THIS IS IT. Wagner: OKAY, IGOR, CIRCLE AROUND THE AREA. - RILEY, YOU'RE NEXT. - READY. OKAY, MELISSA, JOIN UP WITH RILEY. YOU GOT IT. OKAY, BILLY, JOIN UP WITH THE REST OF THE GROUP. YOU'RE NOT ASHAMED OF YOUR OLD MAN, ARE YOU? WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YOU'RE MY HERO, DAD. YOU ALWAYS WILL BE. - I LOVE YOU, SON. - I LOVE YOU, TOO, DAD. LET'S GO SWIMMING. Everyone good? Everything okay? - Jimbo, you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, Dad. - Yeah, we're good. - Melissa: We're good to go. Okay, now follow me everyone, and remember, stay together. Wagner: Everyone stop! - What is it, Mr. Wagner? - Kelp forest. They provide food and shelter to the sharks. Stay together. Jimbo, you okay? Okay. - You doing okay, Melissa? - Yeah, I'm doing fine. Come on, let's take a look over there. Come on, baby, We've never done it in a kelp bed. They're not listening to you, Dad. - Melissa, check this out. - Right behind you. Wagner: Billy, Melissa, let's stay together. Give us a kiss. Tyler, Riley, let's skip the romance and come back with the group. I'll stick with this group. It's so pretty. Hey, you guys, let's stay together. Riley, Melissa, Tyler. They're not listening to you either, Dad. Damn weekend warriors. Wagner: Do me one big favor, Jimbo, and I'll try to get season tickets to the games next year. What favor? Don't tell your mother what we did this weekend. Okay, you got it. Tyler: Hey. Hey, there it is. Riley: Wow, look at the size of that thing. - Wow! - Beautiful. Let's see what we can find. Riley: Tyler, be careful now. It's bigger than I thought it was gonna be. Yeah, a lot bigger. - Hey, Tyler. - Check this out. Tyler, wait up. Wait for me! [ screaming, growling ] [ screaming ] [ screaming ] JESUS, SHARKS! Jim: SHIT, DAD! SWIM, JIMBO! SWIM! Jim: DAD, COME ON! - RIGHT BEHIND YOU. - KEEP SWIMMING, JIMBO! MOVE! [ screaming ] HELP! COME ON. IGOR! I MISS YOU, DAD. Boy: HEY, DAD. MOM JUST CALLED. SHE SAID DINNER WAS READY. I'M HUNGRY AND SHE CAN'T EAT WITHOUT US. SO COULD WE GO HOME NOW? YEAH, DANNY. WE'LL GO HOME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ANYWAY? THINKING. ABOUT SHARKS? - YOUR MOM TELL YOU THAT? - YEAH. - WELL, SHE'S RIGHT. - SHE'S ALWAYS RIGHT, ISN'T SHE? I SUPPOSE SHE TOLD YOU THAT, TOO. - YEAH. - YEAH. - REMEMBER TO PUT YOUR SEATBELT ON. - OKIE-DOKE. MAYOR CORTELL CALLED TODAY. HE SOUNDED VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE BEACH FIESTA NEXT WEEKEND. HE CANCELED THE BEACH FIESTA. - I'M JUST THE MESSENGER. - Danny: WHY'D THEY CANCEL IT? WELL, THE TOWN JUST DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH SPONSORS TO FINANCE IT, HONEY. AMWAY, CORTELL WANTS TO SEE YOU FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. FIRST THING IN THE MORNING? I WAS GOING TO TAKE DANNY-- PROBABLY JUST WANTS TO MAKE SURE THE BEACHES ARE SAFE FOR MEMORIAL DAY. AND WHAT'S THE VERDICT ON THAT? THINK WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT, BUT I'D LIKE TO SEND OUT SOME PATROLS. - OF COURSE HE'S GONNA TELL ME WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. - WHAT ABOUT THE SHARKS? [ sighs ] EAT YOUR VEGETABLES, DANNY. WE LIVE ON THE BEACH, JIMMY, AND YOU HAVE MANAGED TO SCARE HIM TO DEATH ABOUT THE OCEAN. HE'S AFRAID TO GO SWIMMING. AND HE WON'T EVEN EAT FISH. YUCK. OR VEGETABLES. CAN'T BLAME ME FOR THE VEGETABLES. WE'LL MAKE THAT GAME, DANNY. THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL, HONEY, ISN'T IT? - NOT AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU ARE, DARLING. - COME HERE. I CAN'T BELIEVE I FINALLY GET YOU ALL TO MYSELF. OH, NO. I THINK WE SPOKE TOO SOON. I HATE TO TELL YOU, SEÑORITA, BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HEAD ON BACK. NOW GET DOWN BELOW. [ woman screaming ] Woman: HELP! HELP! HELP ME! CARRIE! CARRIE! NO! CARRIE! CAN'T SLEEP? WELL... DO YOU WANT ME TO COME OVER THERE AND PLAY? I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE A RAIN CHECK. Woman: DON'T YOU LOOK NICE TODAY? I'M TAKING DANNY TO THE BALLGAME. THAT'S WHY I'M WEARING THIS. - MORNING. - HEY. I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET MR. VOLKOFF. - HI. - MR. VOLKOFF'S GROUP, R.S.S. AND ASSOCIATES, IS GOING TO UNDERWRITE THE ENTIRE FESTIVAL THIS YEAR. - SINCE WHEN? - SINCE RECENTLY. THE 11TH HOUR, IF YOU WILL. WOW. THAT'S GREAT. JIM HERE IS IN CHARGE OF HORSENECK BEACH SECURITY. THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTAND. HOW ARE THINGS LOOKING OUT THERE? PRETTY GOOD. I ALSO UNDERSTAND YOU ARE ANDREW WAGNER'S SON? YEAH. YOU'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK. YOU HAVE NO IDEA. MR. VOLKOFF IS INTERESTED IN YOUR EXPERIENCE OUT AT THE SANTA CRUZ. GOT TO SPEND MONEY TO MAKE MONEY. IT'S PART OF OUR BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT. MR. VOLKOFF HAS BEEN MORE THAN GENEROUS AND I THINK THE LEAST WE CAN DO IS POINT HIM IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DIAMONDS. NO. I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT. AND WHY IS THAT? PERSONAL REASONS. I'LL LET YOU TWO DISCUSS THE DETAILS. I TRUST YOU'LL DO THE RIGHT THING. I WON'T TAKE HIM TO THAT SHIP, JOHN. - JIMMY, YOU KNOW-- - IT'S A LEGEND. THERE IS NOTHING OUT THERE. SO LET VOLKOFF FIGURE THAT OUT FOR HIMSELF. HE'S PAYING THE BILLS. I PAY YOURS. YOU DO THE MATH. SO THIS IS WHY YOU CALLED ME OUT HERE THIS MORNING? NO, I ALSO CALLED YOU IN TO TALK ABOUT NEXT WEEK'S SECURITY AT THE BEACH. WE NEED TO TAKE SPECIAL MEASURES THIS YEAR. I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT I DO THAT EVERY YEAR. YES, BUT THIS IS A SPECIAL YEAR. GOD KNOWS WE NEED IT AFTER LAST YEAR'S FINANCIAL DISASTER. OH, COME ON. I SAW GREAT WHITES LAST YEAR. WE AVERTED DISASTER. AND ANOTHER THING, JUST PROMISE ME YOU WON'T WRITE ANY MORE ARTICLES IN THE NEWSPAPER ABOUT SHARK INFESTED WATERS OFF HORSENECK BEACH. WELL, I'M HOPING THAT I WON'T HAVE TO, BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU THE "SWIM AND FEED THE REEF SHARK PROGRAM" CERTAINLY ISN'T HELPING MATTERS. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - WHAT I MEAN IS, EVENTUALLY THOSE SHARKS MAY START TO ASSOCIATE FOOD WITH PEOPLE. - THAT CAN ATTRACT THE GREAT WHITES. - GREAT WHITES?! SIR, THEY ARE OUT THERE. I'VE SEEN THEM. AND I'VE SEEN WHAT THEY CAN DO. IF THERE'S SO GODDAMN MANY GREAT WHITES OUT THERE, HOW COME YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE THAT SEES THEM? BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S LOOKING FOR THEM! - MAYOR CORTELL, I NEED PATROLS. - WE CAN'T AFFORD IT. DON'T GO DOWN THAT ROAD AGAIN, OKAY? LOOK, THIS SUMMER HOLDS THAT SPECIAL PROMISE. I JUST WANT YOU TO DO YOUR BEST. - THAT'S ALL I ASK. - YEAH. IT'S A DEAL, SIR. WHAT'S UP? JUST THIS WEEKEND'S THE ANNIVERSARY OF MY DAD'S DEATH. CAN'T GET HIM OUT OF MY HEAD. I KNOW IT'S GOT TO BE TOUGH DEALING WITH THE WAY YOUR DAD DIED. BUT I'M ASK YOU, AND I'M PAYING YOU, TO GET HIM OUT OF YOUR HEAD FOR THE SUMMER. COULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME? THAT I CAN'T PROMISE YOU, JOHN. [ growling ] THAT'S GRANDPA? YEAH, SON, THAT'S GRANDPA. WAS GRANDPA COOL? - WAY COOL. - WHEN DID GRANDPA DIE? BEFORE YOU WERE BORN, DANNY, WHEN HE SAVED MY LIFE. SEE, GRANDPA, HE WASN'T JUST COOL, HE WAS ALSO THE BRAVEST GUY I EVER KNEW. IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM, I WOULDN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW. I WOULDN'T HAVE MET MOM AND YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW EITHER. I DON'T GET IT. THAT'S A STORY FOR ANOTHER TIME, SON. WAS GRANDPA ATE UP BY SHARKS? - YOUR MOTHER TELL YOU THAT? - YEP. AND SHE'S ALWAYS RIGHT, RIGHT? YEAH, DANNY, SHARKS KILLED GRANDPA. YOU KNOW, I HATE SHARKS. THEY SUCK. YES, THEY DO. [ engine starts ] BUCKLE UP, DANNY. BRING US DOWN TO SKIDS OVER THERE. I LOVE THIS JOB. HARKER, DO YOU COPY? - Harker? - A BASE TAN IS A TERRIBLE THING TO WASTE. HARKER, DO YOU COPY? I COPY, JIMMY. HOW WE LOOKING DOWN THERE? LOOKIN' GOOD. LOOKIN' VERY GOOD. - LOOKIN' DAMN GOOD. - WHAT? Nothing. I DIDN'T COPY THAT. EVERYTHING LOOKS COOL. I'M NOT PAYING YOU TO LOOK AT THE LADIES, HARKER. Keep your eyes open. Stay in touch. YOU GOT IT, JIMMY. CHIEF WAGNER HERE. NATIVES SEEM WELL BEHAVED. SO... SO FAR, SO GOOD, MAYOR CORTELL. WE DON'T WANT THEM TOO WELL BEHAVED. - We don't? - NO. THAT WOULD SIGNAL BEER SALES ARE DOWN. Good news all around, though. THE BEACH FIESTA'S SET TO GO THIS WEEKEND. - THANK YOU. - OVER AND OUT. - LET'S PITCH RIGHT. - YOU GOT IT. LET'S BRING IT TO A HOVER. THAT'S NICE. LEVEL OFF. OH, SHIT! IT'S ALL BAD. HARKER, DO YOU COPY?! - HARKER?! - COPY, JIMMY. GET EVERYONE OUT OF THE WATER! WE GOT SHARKS! SHARKS?! Everyone out of the water! Let's go! Let's go! Sharks! Come on! - Move it! - [ screaming ] Sharks! Let's go! Get out of the water! Let's go! Everybody out now! Come on! We got sharks, let's move! Get up on the beach! Come on! Swim! Come on, move it! Leave the raft! Just move! Let's go! Swim! [ screaming ] Come on! Out of the water! Let's go! [ screaming ] Move it! - BP'S DROPPING. - WE GOT SEVERE INTERIOR THIGH LACERATIONS. - PRETTY DEEP. - WE'RE LOSING HIM. JESUS! - YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THE BEACH. - WHAT?! PEOPLE HAVE TO STAY OFF THE BEACH WHILE I HUNT THESE SHARKS. THAT'S INSANITY. I CAN'T DO THAT. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES OUT THERE. I'M NOT COMPLETELY INSENSITIVE TO THAT, OKAY? BUT I GOTTA DEAL WITH PEOPLE THAT MAKE THEIR LIVELIHOOD IN THIS TOWN. I'M NOT GONNA LET A BUNCH OF PEOPLE LOSE THEIR BUSINESSES OVER SOME RANDOM ACT OF NATURE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A STRAY DOG HERE! YOU LET PEOPLE OUT IN THAT WATER, YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE RINGING THE DINNER BELL. - PEOPLE WILL USE CAUTION. - YOU USE CAUTION WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING ON WET ROADS! - WITH THESE THINGS IT'S KILL OR BE KILLED. - SO KILL THEM! IF YOU MESS WITH THIS FIESTA, IT'S GONNA BE MORE VICIOUS THAN A SHARK ATTACK. WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT. IF YOU HAVE EDUCATE THEM, EDUCATE THEM! - BUT THE BEACH STAYS OPEN! - LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU. IT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN AN EVOLUTIONARY BLIP THAT SEPARATES THE GREAT WHITE FROM THE JURASSIC SHARKS OF 50 MILLION YEARS AGO. WE'RE PRACTICALLY TALKING ABOUT MODERN-DAY DINOSAURS OUT THERE. AND JUST LIKE THEY DID FOR 50 MILLION YEARS, SHARKS ARE GONNA GIVE BIRTH IN SPRING AND SUMMER IN WARM TEMPERATURE WATERS JUST LIKE OURS. I'LL TELL YOU ANOTHER THING-- NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE GESTATION PERIOD IS FOR A GREAT WHITE. WAGNER, THANKS A LOT FOR THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC LESSON. WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME? THESE SHARKS ARE BIGGER AND FASTER AND MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN ANY I'VE EVER SEEN AND WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT AN ENTIRE SCHOOL OF THEM. A GIANT SCHOOL OF MAN-EATING JURASSIC SHARKS? YOU'VE BEEN READING TOO MANY COMICS. TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE WHO DIED TODAY. GLAD TO SEE YOU GUYS ARE KEEPING YOURSELVES BUSY. YOU WANT A TURN? THE RECORD'S FIVE MINUTES. FIVE MINUTES, THREE SECONDS. NOT ANYMORE MORE. I'M GONNA BEAT IT. YOU GUYS HEARD WHAT HAPPENED AT THE BEACH, RIGHT? YEAH, WE KNOW. BUSINESS IS DOWN 50%. WE MIGHT HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER JOB. WELL, IT'S GONNA GET WORSE. BEACH IS ON HIGH ALERT UNTIL THOSE SHARKS ARE KILLED. SO I'M GONNA NEED A LITTLE HELP. - YOU BOYS UP FOR IT? - WE THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK. - YEAH, WELL, SO DID I. - LET'S DO IT. I'M IN. HOW ABOUT YOU, GORDO? THINK YOU'LL BE OVER THIS HANGOVER BY TOMORROW? HEY, YOU KNOW ME, JIMMY. I'M THERE. ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU AT THE MARINA AT 7:00. DON'T FORGET TO BRING YOUR GEAR. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A PLEASURE CRUISE. GOOD AFTERNOON LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES to those of you who lost loved ones on the beach yesterday. SON OF A BITCH. I've assembled a crack team of divers... YEAH, RIGHT. ...to go out to the beach and kill the sharks, and make our great beach safe once again. I'd like to second the mayor's sentiments. SO THAT'S MR. VOLKOFF, HUH?. YEAH, THAT'S HIM. And I fully support him. - ARE YOU OKAY? - YEAH, I'VE BEEN BETTER. - WORRYING ABOUT TOMORROW? - A LITTLE BIT. IT'S NOT JUST THAT, IS IT? CARRIE. HE DIED A LONG TIME AGO, JIMMY. - IT WASN'T-- - WHAT? IT WASN'T MY FAULT? YOU DON'T THINK I'VE HEARD THAT A MILLION TIMES? IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. WHEN I WAS IN THAT WATER AND I SAW THOSE SHARKS... Move! Swim, Jimbo, swim! THE ONLY THINK I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS SAVING MYSELF. THE ONLY THINK MY DAD COULD THINK ABOUT WAS SAVING ME. YOU'RE NOT ASHAMED OF YOUR OLD MAN, ARE YOU? ARE YOU KIDDING? YOU'RE MY HERO, DAD. ALWAYS WILL BE. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, CARRIE. I JUST LEFT HIM THERE. - I LEFT HIM THERE, AND MY FATHER DIED. - I KNOW. AND I'M SORRY. BUT YOUR FATHER LOVED YOU, JIMMY. AND YOU WOULD'VE DONE THE EXACT SAME THING FOR DANNY. THANKS. I WOULD. YOU'RE THE BEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME. I DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE ALL THAT OUT ON YOU. - IT'S JUST THIS WHOLE THING-- - I KNOW, BABE. COME HERE. COME HERE. NOW WHY DON'T WE GO TO BED? - I'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER. - YEAH? I PROMISE. I'LL MAKE YOU FEEL A LOT BETTER. I'M GONNA LOOSEN YOU UP. BET YOU ARE. BUT I LIKE TO BE ON TOP. OH, YEAH? YOU'VE BEEN VERY BAD. GUYS I WANT TO TAG AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR OF THESE SHARKS, OKAY? JIMMY, WHY DON'T WE JUST KILL THEM? I NEED TO KNOW WHERE THEY CAME FROM, GORDO, JUST IN CASE THERE'S MORE. WHATEVER YOU SAY, CHIEF. HERE YOU ARE. OH. TOURIST BUSINESS WAS OFF 40% LAST YEAR BECAUSE WAGNER MADE SUCH A BIG STINK ABOUT A BUNCH OF GREAT WHITE SHARKS HE THOUGHT WE SAW OUT THERE. HIS FATHER WAS A NAVY MAN, NO? SO WAGNER MUST KNOW THE SEA QUITE WELL. MUST BE A KNOWLEDGEABLE MAN. NOT ABOUT ECONOMICS, HE'S NOT. THE WHOLE PLACE WAS EMPTY LAST SEASON. EVERYBODY WENT TO FUCKING DISNEYLAND INSTEAD. WHEN IS HE GOING TO TAKE US TO THE BOAT? I DON'T KNOW. HE'S FIGHTING ME ON THAT. I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE. MAYOR CORTELL, THIS WAS PART OF THE ARRANGEMENT. I WILL PULL THE FUNDING FOR THE FIESTA IF I AM NOT OUT THERE DIAMOND HUNTING BY THE END OF THE WEEK. BUT MR. VOLKOFF-- WHICH WILL LEAVE YOUR SUNNY LITTLE COMMUNITY WITH NO MONEY AND A TERRIBLE SHARK PROBLEM. THE CHOICE IS YOURS. MAKE THE RIGHT ONE. ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I WANT YOU TO BE CAREFUL ABOVE ALL ELSE. OKAY? ARE YOU SURE THAT THESE ARE GREAT WHITES? I'M POSITIVE, GORDO. YOU SAW THE DAMAGE. IT'S THE WAY THEY ATTACK-- FROM BELOW, WITHOUT WARNING. THERE'S THREE KINDS OF SHARK ATTACK. THE BUMP AND BITE, THE HIT AND RUN AND THE SNEAK ATTACK. [ laughing ] WHAT DO YOU GET WHEN YOU CROSS THREE DIVERS IN A CAGE AND A PISSED OFF GREAT WHITE? - HUH? - WHAT DO YOU GET? - A BOXED LUNCH. - Man: OH, MAN. Jim: WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS GUY, CAESAR? COME ON. IT'S JUST A LITTLE SHARK HUMOR. ALL RIGHT, STAY FOCUSED. ESPECIALLY YOU, GORDO. Jim: YOU KNOW, FELLAS, MOST PEOPLE WHO'VE EVER GONE SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN HAVE BEEN WITHIN 15 FEET OF A SHARK WITHOUT EVER KNOWING IT. OH GREAT. HOW REASSURING. REMEMBER, ONLY THE UNDERBELLIES OF THE GREAT WHITE ARE WHITE IN COLOR. THEIR TOPS ARE GRAY SO THEY CAN BLEND IN WITH THE DARK WATER, ALLOWING THEM TO ATTACK THEIR PREY UNNOTICED. REMEMBER THAT. ANY QUESTIONS? - I'VE GOT ONE. - WHAT'S THAT? CAN WE GO HOME? DON'T WORRY ABOUT US, BOSS. WE'RE SOLID. ALL RIGHT. GOOD. KEEP THAT CHUM LINE GOING. ARE YOU SURE THAT'S GONNA DRAM THEM IN? A SHARK CAN SMELL A DROP OF BLOOD IN 2,000 GALLONS OF WATER. - THAT SHOULD DO IT. - THAT SHOULD DO IT. REMEMBER, ANY SHARKS YOU CAN'T KILL, TRY AND TAG. BUT, ABOVE ALL, BE CAREFUL. COMMUNICATE WITH ME AT ALL TIMES, ALL RIGHT, GORDO? Caesar: YOU GOT IT. WHAT WE CAN'T KILL, WE'LL TAG. ALL RIGHT. GET YOU OUT TO THOSE CAGES, CAESAR. - GOOD LUCK, NICKO. - THANKS. Caesar: Nothing so far, Jimmy. Gordo: Just the pretty deep blue sea. Jim: Nothing up here either, guys. [ beeping ] HERE WE GO. HEY, FELLAS, THEY'RE COMING FROM EVERY DIRECTION. Jimmy, we got one. - A big one. - Sneak attack. Jim: Talk to me, guys. What's going on? Another one! Over there! And another one! Gordo: Jimmy, they're closing in. - Nicko: Aw, Jeez. - Gordo: Not good. - Caesar, behind you! - Another one! Over here! [ growling ] Caesar, hug the corner! Caesar! - It's breaking up the cage! - Gordo, hold on! ALL RIGHT, YOU SON OF A BITCH. DIRTY, SMELLY FISH. ALL RIGHT, YOU WANNA PLAY HARDBALL, EH? Gordo: Kill it! Get out! Get away! - No, no, no! - Caesar! Gordo! [ screaming ] Jimmy, it got Cesar! GODDAMN IT! Another one! Gordo! Gordo! - OH JESUS. - Gordo! Get out! Get out of the cage! GORDO, SWIM! COME ON, GORDO! SWIM, BUDDY! COME ON, GORDO, SWIM! SWIM. NO! CHRIST. [ cage creaking ] COME ON. COME ON, YOU PIECE OF SHIT, JUST A LITTLE CLOSER. GODDAMN IT! SWIM! COME ON, BUDDY! COME ON! [ screaming ] BASTARDS! HEY. YOU DID YOUR BEST. I NEVER SEEN SHARKS ATTACK LIKE THAT. MIND TELLING ME WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO NEXT? FINISH THE JOB. MANAGED TO TAG A FEW TODAY. GOING OUT FIRST THING TOMORROW. WITH WHO? YOU LOOKING FOR AN INVITATION? SHIT, NO. I DON'T EXACTLY EXPECT THE VOLUNTEERS TO BE LINING UP. NEED I REMIND YOU THAT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE? JOHN, THREE MEN DIED OUT THERE TODAY. FRIENDS OF MINE. - YOU'RE TALKING TO ME ABOUT TIME? - I KNOW. I'M ON MY WAY TO MAKE SOME SYMPATHY CALLS RIGHT NOW. YEAH, THAT'LL MAKE THE FAMILIES FEEL BETTER. BEACHES ARE CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NOTIFICATION FROM ME. GOOD ENOUGH. FOR NOW. GOOD LUCK. THANKS. [ cheering ] ♪ I'M GONNA ROLL, BABY... HYDROPHOBIA, JORDAN, IS THE FEAR OF WATER. ELASMOPHOBIA IS THE FEAR OF SHARKS. AND PHAGOPHOBIA IS THE FEAR OF BEING EATEN. JIMMY, GO HOME. SO IF YOU'RE AFRAID OF THE FIRST ONE, YOU'RE TERRIFIED OF THE SECOND ONE. AND THE LAST ONE, WELL, THE LAST ONE SCARES THE SHIT OUT OF YOU. SO I TAKE IT YOU DON'T WANNA EAT THE WORM, RIGHT? [ laughing ] [ music playing ] COME ON! HEY! - COME ON. - COMING! WHOO! [ screaming ] [ loud laughter ] YOU GONNA EAT THE WORM? VODKA. IT'S THE ICE CREAM MAN. LOOK. [ laughing ] HEY, ICE CREAM MAN. MY CONDOLENCES ABOUT THE MEN WHO DIED TODAY. WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING? GOOD RUSSIAN VODKA KNOCKS YOUR HEAD OFF. I'LL HANDLE THIS ONE, JORDAN. I TELL YOU WHAT, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE YOUR GOOD RUSSIAN VODKA AND DRINK IT, OVER THERE. 'CAUSE I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR CHITCHAT. - YOUR WIFE SAID YOU WERE HERE. - NOT INTERESTED. LOOK, I UNDERSTAND YOU LOST FRIENDS TODAY, SO I'M WILLING TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE FIESTA IS OVER. - BUT THEN... - FORGET IT. YOU WILL TAKE ME TO THE SHIP. - YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE-- - HEY! I'M NOT DOING IT, OKAY? YOU GO BYE-BYE. IN DUE TIME, PERHAPS YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND. GOODBYE FOR NOW. YOU BELIEVE THIS GUY? LOOK, JIMMY, IF YOU NEED HELP WITH THOSE SHARKS TOMORROW, I'M GOOD FOR IT. USED TO DO A LITTLE FISHING WITH YOUR OLD MAN WHEN I WAS A KID. NEVER CAUGHT MORE THAN A HEALTHY BUZZ... BUT WE HAD SOME GOOD TIMES, MAN. JORDAN, YOU KNOW... THE LAST VOLUNTEERS, THEY DIDN'T COME BACK. I MEAN, THESE PUPPIES ARE BIG AND MEAN. SO AM I. SO WHAT TIME ARE WE LEAVING? THANKS. WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE, SIR? WE WAIT FOR WAGNER TO COOPERATE. IF HE DOESN'T, WE MAKE THINGS UGLY. AND WHEN'S THAT GONNA BE? YOU HAVE OTHER PLANS THIS WEEK? - NO, SIR. - SHUT YOUR FUCKING HOLE. MR. WAGNER HAS A SON. - WHAT'S UP, GIRLS? - HEY! I GOT NOTHING HERE, JORDAN. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. WHAT'S UP? A COUPLE OF WEEKEND WARRIORS DECIDED TO JOIN OUR PARTY. Hey, knuckleheads, can't you read the signs? Get the hell out of the water. Get the hell out of the water! - WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, MAN? - TOTAL BUZZKILL. LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE DECIDED TO JOIN THE PARTY. AND I THINK IT BROUGHT ITS APPETITE. Hey, Skipper, close in on those kids, fast! COME ON, MAN. LET'S GO. OH, CHRIST. Skipper, hurry! DUDE, SHARK! [ screaming ] PLEASE, NO. NOT THE KIDS. WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE! SKIPPER, BRING US BY THOSE KIDS! LET'S GET OUT OF HERE! [ screaming ] WE BETTER LOCK 'N LOAD, JORDAN. Girl: HELP! SHARKS! DON'T GET IN, GET OUT! I'M OUT, JORDAN! COME ON. COME ON, KID! GET US BACK TO SHORE, QUICK! HEY, WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SHARKS? WE'LL GET THEM FROM THE CHOPPER. JORDAN TO BASE. JORDAN TO BASE. - WE NEED AN AIRLIFT, NOW. - YOU OKAY? WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING OUT THERE? DIDN'T YOU SEE THE SIGNS? I'M SORRY. YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. HANG IN THERE. WAGNER! WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON? THREE KIDS DIED OUT THERE. I'M GONNA HIT THOSE SHARKS FROM THE AIR WITH EXPLOSIVES. - I CAN TRACK 'EM NOW. - CHRIST! THE FIESTA KICKS OFF IN THREE DAYS. THEN LET ME DO MY JOB, MAYOR! THERE'S OUR SHARKS. HEY, FOSTER! 50 FEET OFF THE SURFACE! HOW'S YOUR AIM, JORDAN? I'M BETTER AT BETTING ON GAMES THAN PLAYING THEM. PRETEND WE'RE PLAYING FOR MONEY. - NICE. - THAT'S ONE. HEY, HOW MANY SHARKS ARE WE DEALING WITH? I DON'T KNOW. A WHOLE SCHOOL. BULL'S EYE! Jim: THE TRIFECTA! YOU MUST BE ONE HELL OF A GAMBLER! ONE MORE TO GO. CLASS DISMISSED! IF THIS ISN'T MILLER TIME, NOTHING IS. IF YOU GUYS ARE CELEBRATING BECAUSE YOU KILLED ALL THE SHARKS, I'LL JOIN YOU IN ONE OF THOSE. THAT IS WHY YOU'RE CELEBRATING, ISN'T IT? IT'S HARD TO SAY, SIR. THE GESTATION PERIOD OF THE GREAT WHITE IS UNKNOWN. IS THAT A YES OR A NO? IT'S A MAYBE. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I'm very happy to announce the beach is now open and safe, Thanks mostly to Jim Wagner of Beach Security. And Larry Foster and Jordan McNeil. Couldn't have done it without them. Due to the courage and determination of these fine men, the beach is now open and the fiesta will proceed as planned. So enjoy the festivities. I KNOW YOU, WAGNER. YOU STILL THINK THERE'S SHARKS OUT THERE, DON'T YOU? I'D HAVE LIKED MORE TIME, BUT I GUESS THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT NOW. WHAT'S THAT? SUMMER BEACH FIESTA. IF YOU DON'T THINK IT'S SAFE, THEN YOU NEED TO TELL THE MAYOR. COME ON, HONEY, YOU HEARD THE GUY. HE'S ALREADY COUNTING BEACH FIESTA PROFITS. Newsreader: ...event will go ahead as planned. This is very welcome news... WELL, LET'S GET DANNY OFF THE INTERNET AND INTO BED. [ phone ringing ] HELLO? - Man: Mr. Wagner? - YEAH, THIS IS HIM. Is this a bad time? THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE SELLING. - WHO IS THIS? - Vlad Pozerov. I'm with Volkoff's group. We'd like to set up a meeting with you. MEETING? WHAT KIND OF MEETING? We want to know if you're interested in investing with us. INVESTING? INVESTING IN WHAT? Your life and the lives of your family. - ARE YOU THREATENING ME? - We'll be in touch. HEY! IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? UH-HUH. THANK YOU. THANKS TO YOU, THIS WENT OFF WITHOUT A HITCH. ANYWAY, I HAVE TO GO RUN SOME ERRANDS. OH. - WHOOPS. - WHERE'S MY QUARTER? THAT CALL YOU GOT LAST NIGHT? YEAH. IT WAS THE RUSSIAN GUY, WASN'T IT? WHAT DOES HE WANT? HE WANTS ME TO TAKE HIM OUT TO THE SANTA CRUZ. HE'S CONVINCED THAT THOSE DIAMONDS ARE STILL THERE. YOU ARE NOT GOING BACK OUT THERE AGAIN, ARE YOU? OF COURSE NOT. I CAN'T. GOOD, BECAUSE YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT RIGHT NOW. LOOK, I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT. BE SAFE. HAVING YOUR THUGS THREATEN MY FAMILY NOW? I APOLOGIZE IF SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE A BIT AGGRESSIVE. I ASSURE YOU I CAME HERE TO CONGRATULATE YOU. OKAY, AT LEAST LET ME BUY THE LOCAL HERO A DRINK. - MM-HMM. - TELL YOU WHAT, YOU GOT TWO MINUTES, PAL. SO WHAT DO YOU WANT, VOLKOFF? I'M WILLING TO SWEETEN THE POT, IF YOU TAKE ME TO THE DIAMONDS. - HOW ABOUT 50 GRAND? - 50 GRAND? GOTTA SPEND MONEY TO MAKE MONEY. THERE'S NO GUARANTEE YOU'RE GONNA FIND ANY DIAMONDS OUT THERE. 20 GRAND EITHER WAY. CONSIDER IT AN INVESTMENT FOR YOUR FAMILY. NO, I'M SORRY. I CAN'T HELP YOU. CAN'T OR WON'T? LOOK, MY FATHER DIED OUT THERE. I CAN'T GO BACK TO THAT PLACE. MY BROTHER SURVIVED OUT THERE, BUT DIED THREE MONTHS AGO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOUR BROTHER? IN FACT, I BELIEVE YOU TWO ONCE MET. HIS NAME WAS IGOR. - IGOR THE PILOT? - YES. BEFORE HE PASSED AWAY, HE TOLD ME ABOUT SANTA CRUZ AND THAT FATEFUL DAY. ABOUT THE THE SHARKS. HOW LIVES WERE LOST. Wagner: Jesus, sharks! LIKE YOUR FATHER'S. HOW LIVES WERE LOST. - LIKE YOUR FATHER'S. - [ screaming ] BUT YOUR LIFE WAS SPARED BY MY BROTHER. HOW LIVES WERE LOST. LIKE YOUR FATHER'S. Wagner: Swim, Jimbo. Swim! CONSIDER THIS PAYBACK FOR YOUR LIFE. - PAYBACK? - OR CONSIDER IT A BUSINESS DEAL. MY OFFER IS MOST GENEROUS. NO. THANKS. BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN B. THAT IS A SHAME TO HEAR, BECAUSE PLAN B'S ARE OFTEN MISGUIDED, AND DESPERATE ENDEAVORS, AND HARDLY EVER HEALTHY ALTERNATIVES-- ARE YOU THREATENING ME AGAIN, YOU PIECE OF-- GET THE FUCK OFF MY BEACH, VOLKOFF!
