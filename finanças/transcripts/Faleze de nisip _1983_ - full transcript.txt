Sand Cliffs Written by Starring Directed by Amira, where do you think you're going? Sit down! You want to go after that crazy guy, right? - Ovidiu! - What? That's the boy who stole the things. - Are you sure? - Positive. Go after him! - Tell the doctor! Behave! Be right back! Doctor! Doctor, there's the thief! The boy who stole your things. - What are you doing here? - Taking a walk. - Why? You were here yesterday, too. - Yes. What did you do? - I bought a donut. - A donut, huh? - Steal from the beach and then lie about donuts?! - Leave him to me! - That's him! - And who are you? You'll find out. What's your name, where are you from? - Where? - From here. - Where's here? Mamaia, Constanta? - That's my business. - Really? Did you steal the things? - He stole them! - I didn't steal anything. Good day! - What's your name? - Mihailescu Vasile. - I thought you'd left for Bucharest. - We decided this morning to stay. You made a good decision. You took the bait, Vasilica. What did you think? "Let me show you idiots how a smart guy operates." I'll take a stroll, hands behind my back... You wanted to check the hiding place. You wanted to defy us, show you've got guts. You steal and then walk on the beach. A hard player! Do you think the state pays me for nothing?! That you can steal like it's nothing? That's what you think? You thought: "The fools are gone. Who would remain there without any money?" You were wrong. Are you startled? Don't worry, kid! We act civilized to honest people. If you tell the truth, we can be friends. Isn't that right? Take his personal info. Have you ever played the piano? Get him to play the piano, freshen him up! The major will be here, too. Good day! Greetings, doctor! Dr. Beurean, the hospital chief, said that you were a renowned surgeon. My wife is committed. Some kidney problems. I was a bit harsh yesterday. You've seen what goes on here. It's our duty. You're a true detective, one of us. Collaborating with the forces. You want to steal our job. Popa, you know what to do. An interrogation, statements, confrontations, on-scene investigations. One extra confrontation can't hurt. Use some detainees. Maybe the doctor was wrong. I'll see you later! Get close, touch him, and the lieutenant will take a photo of you and that person. What's the point? We brought him in, we know him. It's procedure. Please come in one by one. Next! Thank you! Is it so difficult? We brought him in an hour ago. -Yes. Raise your hand! - No, I don't know if it's the same person that stole out clothes. - I didn't see clearly. I had a mask on. - I don't understand. There are two pictures: one, of the real thief, one, of the alleged. - Yes, and? - Yesterday's image is cluttered, today's, urges me to point to him. - Sir, is there a resemblance? - Resemblance is not identity. There may be, but... Could you drop my declaration? As you wish. Next! -Do you want to see a profile? - Yes. Half-step to the right. Were you in the army? Atten-hut! Half-step to the right! I'm confused. I think he was a little taller and didn't have that bandage. Face towards me! - There's no resemblance? You brought him. - Yes, we did. Picture! Thank you! That's 3. Enough. Take them back! Bring Mihailescu to me later! Write down: Declaration. The undersigned... worker in the institution... Where you work. In the day of... while I was resting in Mamaia- at around 12 noon- an unknown man stole my things from the beach. And make a list of the stolen things. A camcorder. State the brand. And the place of purchase, if possible. Also, the price. A radio-cassette player. A camera, etc., etc. Next, a description of the individual. Was he thin, short, tall... What kind of hair he had, his clothes, etc. Detailed, if possible. What did you do yesterday? I warn you: don't try to lie or con your way because it won't work. Think hard before speaking, count to 10. There's lots of time. That's why I'm paid: to listen to you. - I worked the night shift. - When? - Yesterday, all week. - Good. What time did you get off work? - Seven. And? After that? And... I went home. - I ate. - You didn't go to sleep. - No, I left. - Where? What time was it? - Seven. - You got a watch? - No. - How can you know so precisely without one? - I know. OK, and? I went to the beach in Cherhana. I wanted to talk to someone, but he wasn't there. - I fed the dog. - What time was it? Ten o'clock. Good. And? I fell asleep for about half an hour. - I left. - Where to? - There. - Where? - The beach. - Where on the beach? - The Pirates' Inn. And you came across some bags, grabbed them and ran to the woods. - No. - No what? I didn't run anywhere. I went to buy a donut from mother Nica. Boy, look at me! Look at me! Am I the kind of man to be led on with donuts? If you confess, this will be over fast, you'll get two months and be on your way. - You smoke? - No. - You drink? - No. You're a sweet boy, why'd you steal? - I never stole. - How old are you? - 22. - Were you in the army? Yes, like everybody. I was, too. When I was discharged, I stole some peaches, a whole basket. That you stole is not important. It's important you tell the truth. Try! - But I didn't steal. - No more jokes, boy! Here's a pen and paper. Explain in detail how you stole the doctor's things, where you put them. In the sand, in the woods, wherever. You'll make things easier for yourself. - What's your occupation? - Worker. - OK, worker, but what exactly do you do? - Carpenter. - Where? - At the docs, the workshop. And that's what they teach you there, theft?! - Do you have parents? - Yes. - What do they do? - My father's retired due to illness. - He doesn't work at all? He does, here and there. Things come up. - Your mother? - She works at a canteen. - Doing? - She serves meals. - Do you live with them? - No. - Why? They're separated. - Which one of them do you live with? - Neither. - Where do you live, then? - I live with an aunt. Here you go. You're stuck here tonight. You haven't written anything?! What were you wearing yesterday? - Like this. - How like this? These jeans, the t-shirt and slippers. What's with that bandage? Why did Miss Cristina say that you didn't have it? - Some hot clay fell on my hand? - Clay?! Where did clay fall on your hand? At the shop. It was an accident. And you want me to believe you... - Yes. - Why? Because you're a smart guy and I'm a sucker, right? No. - I don't lie. - That would be very good. Did anybody see you yesterday? Wasn't there anybody on the beach? Miss Anica saw me when I bought the donut. Listen, boy, if you mention that donut one more time, I'll get very mad. You're a regular saint, no drinking, no smoking, no eating. - Are you in a sect? - No. - Do you know what it means? - Yes. - What? One who doesn't believe in God. - What do you believe in? - Myself. - Then why do you lie? - I don't. - You don't?! "I went to the beach, got in the water, fed the doggie." I didn't go in the water because of the wound. You see, boy, how you thought of everything?! And, if I ask you why you went to the beach if you couldn't get in the water- you'll tell me you wanted to feed the bow-wow. And the circle is complete. But that's the truth: I went to the beach to feed the dog. I then I went to mother Anica to buy a donut. You act dumb, but you're not dumb at all. It's like that at the beginning: you deny it, try to fool me. And, when it doesn't work anymore, you'll confess, but too late. That's my curse! I only get these tough, rotten cases, with all the crazies on my back! It'll be too late, boy. You'll be just like a lamb. You'll be screaming for me to save you. Did someone hit you or did you just fall? Does it hurt? No? Where's my kite? It's here, next to me. Tell me what happened. Do you know? Where's my kite? Major, permission to report. This Mihailescu won't say anything. I approached him in every possible way. The doctor insists that he stay there with him. Leave them together, could work. - I think this guy is crazy. - Go solve your case! I understand, good day! - I did not enjoy bringing you here. Do you believe me? - No. - If I hadn't seen you with my own eyes... - You didn't see me. Your image is so clear in my mind, that I could describe you in every detail. - You're making a mistake. - Why won't you admit it? 4 people saw you. That's not true. - He didn't see me. - What do you mean? When we were gathered for pictures, he didn't point to me. Still, 3 people recognized you, that can't be argued. I went to the beach, but I didn't steal. I don't steal. Let's make a deal! Keep the money and give me the things. I'll tell them that I got everything back, and you'll be free in an hour. - I don't have anything to give. - Fine, then keep the things, too. Keep the devices, keep the bracelet, the gold cross, the watches, everything! Admit that you stole, and you'll be home in an hour. I assure you! Stefan is my witness. - I imagine you trust him. - Doctor... If you don't care about those things, why bring me here? Because I saw you steal them with my own eyes. OK. And, if you're convinced that I stole them, why do you need my confession? I think I'm allowed to ask for this much, at least. You're not sure it was me. I have no doubt. You do. You want to make me lose my confidence and confess something I didn't do. - What do you mean? - You're not sure what you saw. You talk to me like a friend. But you want to trick me and then announce that the fool's confessed. I know these things from my father. He started by talking nice, and then beat me till I was flat. He yelled like a tyrant. I was to obey him. That's why I left home. And I'll get out of here too, eventually. I can't accuse a man, as long as there's doubt. If the other evidence finds him guilty, fine. - I expected this from you. - Why? You never pushed the pedal all the way. Driving at 60 an hour, like a coward. I drove at 160, at the risk of toppling over. This is what sets us apart. - You could be right. - I am. - Moreover, your private life... - I know it well. I read, shut myself in my lab, develop photos. - From a good reporter, I ended up a good photographer. A coward. Invent a character for yourself, rise above those who step all over you and laugh. - I can't. - Try! - I can't! If everything was like this, I'd have to hang myself. You don't see any nuances. It's all black or white. Yes, black or white. The moment you turn your head,- they strip you naked, and you talk about nuances?! Naive! - I don't think you're right. - That's my opinion. It's a friend's duty to set a mirror in front of you. I reserve the same rights. Of course, any time. Let's deal with the kid in the meantime. You're not saying anything, huh? - Do you know the hunter's tale? - No. A cobra saw a wild pigeon in a tree. It sneaked up a branch and got right in front of the bird. The bird creaked but could not fly away. It was hypnotized. The hunter heard the sound, got close and shot the cobra. When he got close, the bird was dead. It died of terror. We'll see who the kid is: the cobra, the hunter, or the pigeon. Between black and white, there is, theoretically, an infinity of nuances. You do perceive subtle nuances. Let's search the woods some more, maybe we'll find something. Here comes Carmen of Ronda! We're laughing like idiots! Indeed. What's gotten into you? - Did you find anything? - No. We haven't found anything. - He came from the right, yes? - Yes, from Cherhana. He was calm, pacing, although he heard Cristina yell. Why didn't you yell? You were closest. If someone yelled thieves, Mrs. Selaru would've noticed. But, as it is, we're silent, the rest are silent, the aggression... That's what we are; we deserved it. Please stop drinking! - Listen, Cristina... - Yes. When you got out of the water, you didn't have a suit, right? I just took my top off, that's all. Is it because of the top or the thief that you can't sleep? I wouldn't have cared if I hadn't seen him. As it is, I can't forget him. - I see him all the time. I know him well. - Are you upset about the things? No, not even about the money. But... His gesture. It's like he said to me: idiot, catch me if you can! - Why care so much about a thief? - Because I saw him, that's why! I saw him steal and I can't forgive him. Honestly, relax, they were just some trifle things. - Why didn't you run after him? - Screw him, forget it! I can't forget. Such courage! He only ran after he got everything. - And not because he was afraid. - It was just courage. Courage has it's limit, too. When you're caught, leave it all and run! - So much hassle about some junk?! - I told you I don't care about the stuff! What is it then? I want to make him admit it. What time is it, doctor? 2:30 Hold on, I'll come, too! You're ridiculous! Your pride can't take it. A stranger dared not to get trampled. Some nerve, right? Please, stop arguing! It's 2 am, and you're talking about a thief like he was who knows what. You want another argument? Or do you like having Stefan as a spectator? Please, applaud, he's found and audience. I'm leaving tomorrow. You're going, too? Think I'll stay. I have nothing to do. We'll talk about it tomorrow. Let's go to bed! - You want to leave, Miss Cristina? - I have to. - Just now? The weather's right. What are you doing? Take the boat! I'm not leaving. - What do you mean? - I'm not leaving. - You promised, Teo. Don't you want to abandon this situation? - No. You can't or you won't? Teo, it's useless. We're wasting our vacation time and out nerves. Talking about the same things over and over. Let's pretend nothing happened. The room's paid for. We'll borrow some money from prof. Cariade and all will be fine. You promised, Teo. Let's leave! I know what will happen. I feel I'm going crazy. Why should we abide to the thief's game? He knows that, without a confession, the police will let him go. I want to make him admit, tell the truth while he's there, no matter what. - I can't think like that. - Try! - Get a hold of yourself! - I can't. I told you. I deserve a vacation, a little rest. Let's go to the mountains. If only this sacrifice had a point. It has. I won't allow anyone to make me do something I don't want. Do you understand now? The wounded child died. As you see, it's no longer a common theft, it's murder. The fact that you discovered the child after your things were stolen- leads us to think that Mihailescu Vasile pushed him. Unwittingly, though. Also, we won't draw out the possibility of an accident. Sending 22 yo to jail for theft and murder is not a trifle thing. I'll ask you once again: Are you sure that M. Vasile was the one you saw? Of course. Popa, bring him here! Mr. Albini, I'm aware of your opinion. I brought you here hoping that you would help. Come in! M. Vasile, I hereby notify you that you stand accused of theft and murder. I know you had no reason to kill the child. The mistake started along with the theft. Look at me! My boy... He stood in your way. You pushed, he hit his head on a brick, and died. I didn't kill anybody. What's your name? - Mihailescu Maria. - Are you a relative of Vasile? - Cousins. - Where do you work? - At a hairdresser's. Did Vasile bring you a camera or tape player for you to sell? - No. - Sure? Sure. What did he do? He's messing around. We've searched everywhere. Nothing. Popa's there. - Where was Vasile last night? - Home. - And yesterday? - He was working. - What did he do? - When did he leave home? About a year ago. His father's the man who gathers bottles on the beach. - They don't get along. He used to beat him for no reason. - His mother? She's crazy. She ran off with the canteen administrator. Wants to marry him. But Vasile's a good boy. He helps out at every salary. Does he have an entourage? I've never seen him drunk. He has no friends, nobody. - What does he do after work? - He goes to his uncle, goes to the beach. He likes the sun? Yes, he loves the sea. - Do you have the keys to this trunk? - No. - Maybe he has it. - We'll take it. Fine, if you say you're from the police. Vasile is with us. I lied at first. He didn't sleep at home. Tell the truth if you want to help! I'd give my life for him. I don't know what to say. Teach me what to do, where to go to save him. Did he bring home any objects from the beach? What kind? A gold chain, a camera, a tape player... I feel you're good. I'll tell you everything. Yesterday... no... The other day, when Vasile came home, I didn't see any strange object. I swear! I swear on what I hold most sacred! On my life! I sent him to his uncle for some fish. - He went to the beach. - Yes, the beach. If that's wrong somehow. That's not what he's guilty of. - Mihailescu's locker, chief. - Hold on. Come open Vasile's locker! Take the screwdriver! Yes, this is it. How's Mihailescu's work conduct? He's hard working, reserved. Reserved?! Did you forget he tried to kill me? What can I say, they went at it. Not seriously. He stuck my head in the sawdust. If it wasn't for you, I'd be dead. Tell me chief, does Vasile do any trading? I never saw him. This one, however, sells cigarettes and gum from the port. To be honest, I don't know him well. He's a good boy, punctual, hard working. Not a clown like these guys. He eats alone at lunch. That's his spot. After that he goes home, he doesn't like the crowd. - And, in his spare time? - He works on a sailboat. Stays overtime. - He's gathering money for materials. - He needs money? That's what he told me. If you hear he's selling anything, a gold cross, a camera, call me! - You'll be doing us a favor. - At once, major. Open that chest! Let's go to Cherhana! - Good day, chief! - Good day! - What were you doing? - Having lunch. Want a borscht? Fat as I am, what'd you think, "he'll want some"? "He won't resist a borscht." Good day! Stop! - Is it bought? - I make it. Let's see if you guess what from. - I need to do a search. - You wouldn't come for nothing. - I don't have a warrant from the prosecutor. - We don't care about papers. - Did you hear what happened on the beach? - I don't gossip with the women. - It's about your nephew. - Vasile? - Yes, Vasile. He was seen stealing some objects from the beach. A nearby child... died at the hospital by a fracture. Vasile, it's like he's cursed. His parents kicked him out. He's at his aunt now. Now, another misfortune. Like he's cursed. Whenever he comes by, I ask him: "When you look at me, do you see me?" - Commander, the bag's been found. - Where? - On the beach. Manole's dog found it. - Really? Major, with your permission: Our dog found this bag buried over there. Apparently, he wasn't a stranger to this place. He stopped here... he changed the things with the other bag, and left. Logical. - Do you know what was in it? - How would I? Money and objects amounting to 25-30 thousand lei. Maybe some passer-by left it. We found the bag buried in the sand, with this cloth over it. - Did you see him the day before? - No. When did he use to come here? Before or after work. I'd give him a herring for his aunt. Yea. Keep searching, who knows? Let's talk a little. You too. Search! Go on! Smell! Search! Go dampen it in the water! - Good day! - Good day! - Are you mother Anica? - Yes. - Are you Turkish? - Yes. - Who's he? - He's also Turkish. Memet, my husband. - What did he say? - He said to help yourselves. - Do you know me? - No. - Major Raicu, from the police. - Good day! Did you hear what happened here? It was the crazy guy, major, trust me! He comes, asks for a donut, pays. Takes a few steps, sits where you are, and stares at my daughter. - Was he here the day before? - He comes every day, I don?t keep track. - Aren't you the man with that trouble? - That's him. Listen to me, the crazy guy's the thief! He would be capable. Help yourself! Take a picture, I see you have a camera. - Are you authorized? - How else? For the sugiuc, and all the rest. Here's my daughter Amira, let her tell you about the crazy stalker! Amira, he is the major, he's asking about that crazy guy of yours. Was he here the day before? I haven't seen him for two days. At what time did you see him last? Noon. Major, come tomorrow. Maybe I'll find something out from our Turks. I'll bring fresh donuts and sugiuc. Tell him I'm waiting! Tell whom? The boy. I don't know his name, we've never spoken. Tell him I'm waiting! OK - What do you have against me, doctor? - Or you, against us? I have nothing against anybody. I just want to be left alone. Then why won't you confess? - Why keep saying no? Why fight us for 10 days? - I'm not fighting. I can't fight you while you're friends with everyone here. Yes, yes, I saw. I'm not a simpleton. - I'm a normal citizen like yourself. - Not true! You're a big shot and I'm a worthless carpenter. How then? Vasile... Why won't you be reasonable? Why won't you confess? Just say: "Yes, I took them", and you'll be home in your bed tonight. You see, how can you say we're equals, when I have to do what you say?! How? To hell with life and who put me in this mess! - Say I didn't steal the things and hit the child? - I saw you with my own eyes. Not true, you didn't see me. You're stubborn. - But you'll admit it in the end. - Why, I can't defend myself? I'll yell in the street: "I didn't steal, and I didn't kill anybody!" - How about that? - Go on! Go on, yell! Let's see who believes you. How can I believe when I saw you with my own eyes? I understand, but what if you're wrong? Think about me, also! I was fired because I was gone for so long. I don't have anybody. How will I survive? And, if we stick to your version? They'll put me in jail. If it were up to me, I'd say: "Go home, boy", but that's life. One of us must lose, be the pigeon, like he says. Meaning I must be the one to... yea. What must I do? - To confess. - That's all? And I can go home? You have my word. Stefan is a witness. He's with you. How about it? Go on, speak! Confess! Speak! Confess! I stole them. What did you do with them? I buried them in the sand. Where? Near Cherhana. Can you lead us there? Yes. I like you, doctor. There's something about you. Great energy and confidence. And, especially, the need to win. You sacrificed your vacation, only so you'd win. Even if the others consider you a bit odd. You have a passion for sensing things and people. You hear them with your ear and peck with your finger. You're a leader. - But there's something bothering you, professor. - True. Too great an effort for such a petty cause? No, I love trivial pursuits. Still, you're missing something. - What's that? - A flywheel. A what? A flywheel does nothing. When the car receives a shock,- it intervenes and adjusts the operation. Got it? Not really. If you watch a star through a telescope,- it's image doesn't form at the exact line of sight. While the luminous rays of the star pass through space,- the telescope has moved slightly, due to the Earth's movement. A small deviation called aberration has taken place. In your calculations, you haven't considered a possible aberration. Do you understand now, doctor? To be honest, no. I don't see where you're going, professor. Let me think of something else, doctor. Yes. Praxiteles. The great sculptor. You've heard of him. It seems he was mangled by a panther he used as model. Doctor, you know that secrets are obtained only through courage and violence. You can't know how violent a secret can be. That's the problem. The panther-reality can eat you. You must take into account the aberration. A flywheel is necessary. Otherwise, reality will kill you, just like a panther. I'll be leaving. I'd like to meet in Bucharest, doctor. - I'll look you up, professor. - Come sometime. We'll chat. Absolutely. - Good night! - Pleasant dreams! Watch out for the flywheel-aberration! Good night! Come on! What are you standing there for? Go dampen it! Are you demented, boy? Didn't you notice a landmark, a bush. - A sand dune, something. Where were you? - Here. How the hell do you expect us to find them, boy? How? Look at me! Do you see anything? Feel anything? Look around you! Look, that willow is taller, maybe there. - I don't know, here somewhere. - You want to keep me here all morning? In this heat! Do you see the state I'm in?! When I left home, my clothes were clean. Do you expect me to go home like this? Do you want to make a mockery of us? Tell me! - Tell us where you hid the bag! - I want to. - Why do you mock us then, why? - I'm not, I don't remember. You can't remember, wise guy?! You want to defy us. Look for the damn bag! Where do you say you hid those things? Where did you put them? In a pit? Look for them, if you say they're in a pit! Look! - Look for them, look! - Mr. Popa! Allow me, please! There you go! Maybe you're more at ease with the doctor. You try! You know each other better. I'm tired. I can't do it. Even if you took some of the things, I don't care. I'll tell them to let you go, believe me! What, then? Why aren't you looking at me? - Are you afraid of me? - No. We have to prove that you only took the bag. That you didn't hit the kid, hence murder. Understand? Yes. This is your last chance. Tell me, where's the bag? In a pit somewhere. In one of these pits, where the hell could it be? In one of these pits. - Here? - Yes. Here, in this hole. Damn life and who put me in this mess! Did you lie to me? Did you con me? - Tell me! - You told me to confess and I'll be free. Nothing more. - Reveal the things! - You told me you don't care about them! That I only had to confess and I'd be free. - But where are they? - How should I know if I didn't take them? You dare to lie to me?! I'll kill you! I'll kill you with my own hands! Tell me where they are! Don't lie! Teo, leave him! Tell me! Tell me where they are or I'll kill you! I wanted to get you off, but I'll throw you in jail! - I didn't take them! - You'll rot there! Why won't you confess? Don't you want a slice? Listen, Cristina... You're always quiet for some time now. Are you dissatisfied? Do you have something to reproach? Others think we're a happy couple. - What don't you like, Cristina? - I really like how you beat the kid. How should I have treated a thief? He was defying us. It's everybody, not just a thief. Your mind gets set and that's it! Now, for instance, you want to become hospital chief, right? You have some imagination. I was there when Elena came saying you'd be excellent as chief. And you were glowing. You're funny. You've understood the role played by politics, and your aims are high. I'm an oaf needing political support?! Is that your opinion of me? On the contrary, you're a fine surgeon, but you only care about yourself. Just like anyone. But you're not just anyone. You can have anything without any justification. Minculescu was operated badly. By you, that's why he died. No true. I'm good at my job, please don't butt in. - And don't judge me! - Why are you yelling? - Why are you offending me? - If telling the truth is an offence, I'm not at fault. Maybe you hesitated, your hand trembled and... Cristina, you're like a dog- you like to bite, to take away my peace. What do you want me to say? "Darling, you're so wonderful", right? A partner mustn't hold back anything. Those are your words. I agree. But you don't want to understand, but humiliate me. And I want you to leave me alone. Listen, Cristina... I don't like... I can't be in second place. - So? - I'm scared. - You're scared? - Yes. I must be first, so I don't crash. - I need success. - And you think that's fine? Tell me how else to survive. You're a doctor. - And anyone can attack me in an article. - But you give life. Illusions. I postpone death. I operate a lung cancer for a comfort of death. Aren't you glad if you give someone a few extra days? What can I say? You'll say I'm a cynic. Besides... I do it for you too, Cristina. We've been together for 5 years. I never asked for anything. Everyone knows me as Cristea's lover. When I come to you I feel like a prostitute. I wanted a child. Sure, this is the calling of a mediocre woman. - You remember what you said about the child? - Yes, but quiet down! You said: "If I have an orange, I eat it, not give it to the child." Sure, if you have a goal, you forget all else. Take everything and give nothing. Pretend to love. You're used to me. But I can't go on, I'm at wit?s end, I'll do something stupid. So, you're gonna kill yourself again? You can't take pictures here! Do you hear? - Just the boats. - No boats, nothing! I can understand you don't want to be shot, you're unshaven. But the boats? You sent my nephew to jail. That's why the police searched me. They sit at night on the beach, spying me. - He did nothing wrong by taking photos. - What did Vasile do wrong? Don't let me catch you here again! I rule here! The beach, the cabin, the sea are all mine! I work from noon till night for them. File a complaint if you don't like that! - God damn you! - Are you crazy? Let go! Squealers! Don't let me catch you here! Get lost! I should've whooped you, squealers! Hello, Crstina! When did you get back, Teo? A few weeks ago. I kept calling. Did you move in with your parents? Why are you silent? Do you want to break up, Cristina? You caught on slow. The sea incident helped, especially the end. Cristina... Yes. I met Mircea, the guy in my shift, and moved in with him. - Do you want to be cynical? - No, honest. A woman can't break up without a little fuss. Why should I be different? I wish you'd think it over. We can rebuild. We'll start from the beginning, and it'll be OK. I didn't leave then to impress or win you over. I don't like this cheap game. I knew I would eventually leave, I knew I wouldn't come back. I don't want to say how much I suffered while I was with you, but it was awful. You live in a lie. But take heed. We'll talk another time. Right now, I can't. "What sets the tempered clavichord apart", wrote Albert Schweitzer- is not the form or architecture of melodies... Are you crazy? Why'd you spend so much? Mr. Stefan Albini aka The Chink... You're looking at the new hospital chief. They just named me. How about it? Come on, bottoms up, cheers! An educational force, developing and enlarging the horizons of those... How'd you fool them? Slalom among the giants. Bravo! Always on top. Honored student, good at sports. Renowned surgeon. Director. - A winner in life and at the hospital. - Taste some roe. What are you hinting at? You won't get upset, OK? You are a prophet to me. Go on, shoot! I couldn't say that you ever did something disregarding eventual benefits. What do you mean? More specifically, what are you saying? That I'm a common career-seeker,- profiting from his father's name, his talent, etc. etc.?! - That's what Cristina thought. - You could even prove the contrary. - Exactly! Then? - Then, you have everything. Power, ability to travel. A future university position, high circles. I've told you that I fear second place, and the unreal. Reality is what you fear. You modify reality so it'll fit your ideas, mutilate it. - You're out of touch with it, that's your condition. - Really? Cristina was the first symptom. Women have a sense of impending wreckage. They leave damaged ships. - The kid was the second. - And the third? The third... Hasn't arrived. I'm waiting. When you live among wolves, you learn to howl like them. Only the kid didn't want to howl like a wolf. He revolted. He won. That's the truth, like it or not. I was looking at you when you said how you made a huge slalom. So many wasted hours just to get accepted. So much wasted energy- alongside people whom you hate, think low of. Why? For what? For a little more money? For the power to command nurses, doctors? It's not worth it, the stake is too low. You need to be a doctor, not a director! A doctor! Your hands are gold. When a doctor has talent as surgeon,- he is not allowed to pursue a sterile career, even if that's his hobby. Of course. What will you do tomorrow? Come to me! What can I do for you? We'll get into that cage and develop photographs. Come on, girls! Let's dance! That's it! Pirouette! Be careful! Very careful! Again! Get up! Very good! Get up! Come on, dear! Come on, girls! When I was at the hospital... a spider made his home above my bed. I nicknamed him Adolf. Every day, when I woke up, he was above my head. I'd lift my hand and brake his web. He'd start rebuilding immediately, with haste. The next day, I'd repeat my gesture- out of a stupid instinctive fear. What could a poor spider do to me? Just like that, day after day, I'd break it, he'd rebuild it. Adolf lost his compass after two months. He'd weave badly. Threads over-imposed each other. The net lost it's symmetry and perfect geometry. He was more and more harassed. His whole cob became a shapeless bulge which surrounded him. He got stuck in his own net, just like you. I became, for Adolf... what others... were to me, over there. Then, I realized... what it means... to have a flywheel. Were you in there for long? Where? The place you were talking about. Adolf... No. He's so cute. What's his name? - What's in here? - Food. Fine. Leave it with me. Later. Cristina! - Won't you stay? - I can't. Am I asking for too much? A day together, like before. - I must be home tonight. - Is he really that strict? I've explained why you insist. Are you living with him? - No. - Is he living with you? Did you paint? - Why would I? - For a bit of change. I didn't feel the need. Then why do you want to come back? - Because I promised. - Whom? Myself, first of all. What did you do on New Year's? I stayed at home. You? I was on shift. I must leave now. Please don't see me out! I was appointed to defend him, doctor. I had no bias. The death of the child turned out to be an unrelated accident. And, as you know, nothing was proven relating to the theft. Causality doesn't always lead to the bottom of things, doctor. He wasn't the one you saw. Even if he was, what you saw didn't exist. Take care, doctor! - Do you have a smoke? - No. - Have a Kent, then. - I don't smoke. I found it on the beach. You can find anything. But what are you doing here? Walking. Why don't you search? I'll teach you to. I've seen you often. Did you lose something? No. Listen... Did you, by chance, find a yellow bag with some things? A tape player... yes, yellow. A camera. What else? A chain with a cross and a gold bracelet. No? - What do you find? - Bottles. - Bottles? - Yes, I clean and sell them. See you! I've been here for a few days and wanted to check in on the kid. - Now that he's working. - He transferred. Everyone pestered him. Like scabs on a healthy man. He came home, got his wooden trunk and left. - Do you know where? - He said nothing. Neither where or if he's coming back. He gave me 300 lei, opened the door and left. It's a great sin, what you did. You shouldn?t have put him in jail. He was 19 before anything good happened to him. His parents kicked him out. He had a good job, earned enough for a quiet life. And trouble found him. You, a city man, picked him as a target. - You think I had something against him? - I don't, but yes. Otherwise you'd leave him be. - You said he found a job. - Yes. Far? I won't say, why should I lie? The devil may tempt you to go to him and do bad. Leave him be! I heard you're a big man there, in the capital. You, and educated man, fighting a child. How come? Forgive me for asking: what brought you here again? You simply were in Constanta? - I knew the address: Toamnei, 29. - Yes, Toamnei 29. If you remembered it for so long, then it wasn't easy for you either. Something kept burning at you, and you said: "I'll go visit". Right? Yes, to see about the kid. Funny how you call him. "Kid". I think... I'm just saying. That you don't hate Vasile. Then what led you to pester him and send him to prison? I wanted to find out what happened on the beach that day. Just for that? That's the only reason he spent so many months locked up? You think that's not enough? I don't know. Maybe it is, if it was theft and murder. In any case, he wouldn't want to see you again. Can I help in some way? Give him peace, let him live. Doctor Cristea! Doctor! Wait! If you want to help, give him some money, doctor. He's going to marry and doesn't have a dime. No one will lend him. He's just an ex-con, right? You can give him a wedding present, after all the joy you brought. You ruined his life. Why do you keep bothering him? He left the yard by choice. Did you hear, doctor? Right now, he's an unskilled worker. With only a vocational school. When he went to the girls parents to propose, they told him to get lost. He came home and washed the floors until he broke the brush. Then he scrubbed with his fingernails, like a loon, until he broke them off. He only received his workmates' ridicule. He's like a scared dog. That's the truth. He's lost faith in everyone. I went to Amira and told her to run off with him. Now he works here, at the mill. If you want to help, give them 5000 lei, doctor. Not 5, 10.000. Instead of regrets and whining. You came to torture him some more. You have power and you can hurt him. Perhaps this is a social inquiry. You want to see if the ex-con is integrated into society. If he returned to his old workplace and is now a model citizen. Right? Go on... Beat it! And get your piece of junk out of here! And to hell with you! Your cousin told me you got married. Yes. With that young girl... She came to the beach. Amira, yes. She sold donuts with her mother. I'm glad that you started a family. Did you have a wedding? No. I have some business to attend to. Maria told me you have no money for a wedding. You want to give me money? I'd be happy to help. You mean you want to pay off all I've suffered in jail. And when I got out. Right? I lend it to you until you have it. Why won't you leave me alone, doctor? Leave me alone! What do you want from me? What? You still want more? Leave me alone to live my life the way I want. I don't need anything. I don't want money. Just to be left alone. I don't need anything. - Nothing, nothing! - I want to... Leave me alone! I don't need money. What do you want? What do you want from me? Why didn't you want to confess then, on the beach? If you'd told the truth, you'd be free. I promised. Leave me alone! Wait, don't go! Kid! Kid, don't run! I'll find you! I'll find you in a snake's hole! Kid, don't run! Wait! You stole them, admit it! I saw with my own eyes. Where are you? Confess! Wait for me! Stop running! Wait! Kid, admit it! You're the thief. Confess at least now! I saw you, kid! Confess! Wait for me! Don't hide from me! I saw you with my own eyes. You can't lie to me. Wait for me! Let's talk! In other roles Subtitled by m4lvolio
