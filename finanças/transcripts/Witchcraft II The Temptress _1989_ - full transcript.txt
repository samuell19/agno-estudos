[music playing] [music playing] DOLORES (VOICEOVER): Filet of venous snake in the cauldron boil and bake, eye of newt and toe of frog give back the eternal fog. Ada's fork and blind worms sting and lizards fled in howling moon for a charm of powerful trouble like a Hell grasp boil and bubble. Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, witch's mummy and more engulf. Of the ravine is salt sea shark, root of hemlock dig it in the dark, liver of blasphemy in June, gall of goat and slits of ewe slivered in the moon's eclipse, nose of Turk and Tartar's lips, finger of bird's strangled babe, ditch delivered by a thread. Make the gruel thick and stab. Add there to a diver's children for the ingredients of power cauldron. Cool it with the bamboo's blood when the charm's burned and good. [music playing] DOLORES (VOICEOVER): The dye has been cast, William. [thunder clap] You know, after all this time, most girls wouldn't call it pushy. Well, I'm not most girls. MICHELLE: Will you know I love you. Will, listen to me. I just said I love you. Will, I just said I love you. I love you. Yeah, I know. So what are we going to do now? Why do you have to go away to college? It's not like I'm going across the country. It's just a half an hour away. But you're going to come back every weekend? Yeah, I'll try. I need more than that. And so do I. [music playing] [dog growling] [romantic music playing] [doorbell] Shit. Your parents? Not unless they forgot their keys. If it's Boomer, he's dead. If it's my father, we're dead. [doorbell] Please. Sorry, to bother you, William, but-- is there something wrong? Um-- no. You just look different. Good different or bad different? Oh-- good. Who was that girl I just saw running out your back door? Oh, Michelle. Oh, Of course, Michelle. Is there something I can do for you? Actually, I was just wondering, have you seen my cat? Oh, your cat. No, no, I haven't. Well, I'll just have to say good night then. WILL: Uh, Miss Jones-- It's Dolores. You forgot this. That's not mine. Someone must have left it for you. WILL: The curse of death on all but thee. Eternal life's your destiny. Yeah, sure. Boomer? Boomer, I know you're there. I'm not falling for this. [phone ringing] Michelle. Will, everything all right? WILL: Uh-- yeah. Who was it. It was Miss Jones next door. She was looking for her cat. Oh, and it looks like Boomer left another one of his practical jokes. God, I wish he'd grow up. You know, I ought to set him up with Rosemary. Don't laugh. She's got a great personality. DAD: Michelle, you home? Hey my dad's home. He just got back from church. And I got to fix him something to eat. So, I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah, sure. OK. OK, bye. Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. My feet are killing me. I have never danced so much in my life. Well, we have to do this more often that's all. As soon as Will goes off to college, we'll have lots of time to be alone. Boy, sure went fast didn't it? I just happened to remember that I love you. Yeah But I wish he didn't to go. I know. But come on. He's a grown man. He should be on his own. You know? God knows the sacrifice we've been through to get him this far. Besides when we decided to take him that day, we-- uh-- we knew he'd have to leave us eventually. I know. But I'd just hate to think what would happen if-- Sh, sh. There you go again worrying. Now, didn't we raise him to be a good man? Well, then that's all anybody can ask for. [eerie music playing] I hope you're right. [eerie music playing] [screaming] [heart beat] [screaming] [gasping] [heart beat] DOLORES (VOICEOVER)The children of the beast will rise from a fire, take their place on the throne of power. [screaming] [dramatic music playing] [panting] MOTHER: Will? Will, breakfast. [music playing] What's a four letter word for-- what's wrong? Jessie, where did you get this? It was on the hall table. By day to unfold-- finally found us. Do you think he knows? I don't know. No, no, no, it's just the beginning now. He'll get three packages. This one last night. He'll get another tonight. And the following one tomorrow night. And then he will know everything. Morning, Mom, Dad. Hi, son. Good morning, dear. How'd you sleep last night? I had the weirdest dream. MOTHER: What was it? God, it was strange. It was like somebody getting burned at the stake. All this stuff. Blood was dripping out of a woman's mouth. It was weird. Will, where did you get this box? Somebody left it on the front porch. What was in it? Looked like an ashtray to me. Well, where-- where is that now? It's in my room. Could we take a look at it? Sure. It's all right. [eerie music playing] Strange. It's gone. Are you feeling all right? You Look a little pale and a little warm too. Maybe you should stay home today. Don't worry about me, Mom. I'm fine. Jess, could you give us a moment alone please? You've always been such a good kid, Will. I'm not a kid anymore, Dad. I'm a man now. Dad, I know all about birth control if that's what this is about. Yeah I know. I know. No, what about love. You know, there's-- there's all kinds of love. Will, I mean, there's the love you feel for Michelle. I-- I'm no good at this. I just want you to know, son, that-- if you ever need us for anything-- anything-- we'll be there for you. We love you. I know that, Dad. Good, good, good. Do me a favor. Don't get any bigger. [eerie music playing] Oh. Relax, man, it's me. Boomer, you scared me to death. What you got? Another one of your stupid practical jokes. What's the gag behind this one? I've never seen it before. Where'd you get it? You mean this isn't yours? What's that say? I don't know. Hey, do you know where Audrey might be? Audrey? Man, that chick's nuts. What you want her for? Did you finally give up on Michelle, man? Boomer give it a break. There's more to life than sex. Nah. I think Audrey's in the library today, man. OK I'm out of here then. I'll see ya. -OK. You got it. To what we do we owe this auspicious occasion? I do read occasionally, you know. You know the last occasion you were here was when you and Boomer discovered that issue of National Geographic on the South of France. The one with the topless beaches, remember? Fourth grade-- long time between books, William. Hey, Boomer was just talking about you. Yeah, what did he say? Hm, uh-- I-- hey, Audrey, I need to ask you a favor. Do you have any idea what this means? What these markings say? Latin. What does it mean? I'm not sure. It's got a lot a weird abbreviations and odd words. It's going to take a while. Would you try? It's real important. What's it worth to you? I'll make you a deal. I'll translate this for you, if you can get Boomer to take me to the medieval Italian tomb sculpture exhibit at the museum. Yeah, no problem. Boomer will love it. Great, I'll get on this right away. And I'll call you at your house later. I'll be at Michelle's. OK. Later. [music playing] Can I help you? I'm sorry. I thought you were falling. Is that right. Well, now that you mention it, I feel a little unstable up here. Do you think you can steady me until I'm finished? A little higher. Much better. Oh Thank you, Will. Hm, after all these years, you can hardly see it. Oh, yeah, I was too young to remember the accident. You fell of a swing. We were worried about you. We? Didn't I tell you I knew your parents? No, uh-- what are you doing? You should know what I'm doing. Oh, yeah. I-- I gotta go. [music playing] [panting] [moaning] [roaring] William, my goodness, I thought you were going to know the door down. I'm sorry, Reverend. Come on in. Hi. Audrey called. She wanted you to call her as soon as you got here. I missed you. I missed you, too. [clearing throat] Daddy. Sorry, dear, I need my glasses. Guess I'm getting absent minded. Call Audrey. Hi, Audrey Denberg, pl-- oh, hi, Audrey. Will, thank god, you're finally there. Yeah, well, hello to you too. What did you find out? AUDREY (ON PHONE): You're not going to believe this. I found out the meanings of all those abbreviations, but not the specialized words. I've only got the first part done. And I found it in an old manuscript on witchcraft. Witchcraft? OK, so what it says-- [speaking latin] What does it mean? AUDREY (ON PHONE): To unfold matters concealed in glue far under the earth. Huh? Why would anybody want to send that to me? AUDREY (ON PHONE): There's more. A lot more. OK, so tell me. No way. You have got to see this for yourself. Audrey, come on, quit goofing around and tell me about it. How does a blind man describe an elephant? What? Will, you simply have to experience what I've got to show you. Miss Denberg-- It's visual and it's weird. AUDREY (ON PHONE): It's something else. I don't know. Miss Denberg, please, we need you in the stacks, not on the phone. OK Will, I have to go if you know what I mean. I'll be at your house after work. Bye. Yeah, sure, Audrey. I was wondering when you were going to show up. I'd hope this day would never come. You owe me a caretaker. I was much more than that. He must fulfill his destiny. He's no longer yours. [grunts] Do you really think you're puny white magic can stop me. You're too late. He's under a pure spell. He'll have nothing to do with you. Men, boys, they have desires. They can't control themselves. He'll fight you. Three boxes, three nights. and the third night William shall ascend the throne on his own will or not. Wass up? How's it hanging? All right, man. How you doing? Good. You're sweating like a pig. Hey, what do you think of Audrey? Audrey? She's a loony bin. She is kind of cute without her glasses. I think she wants to go out with you. Yeah? Are you interested? No way, man, she'll ruin my rep. Tell you what. I'll give you two tickets to the Ozzie Osbourne concert if you take her out. Front row? Eighth row, balcony. You got it, dude. Hey, William. [eerie music playing] Anybody home? MAN: Audrey. [door slams] Hey, William. This isn't funny. Where are you? MAN: Audrey? Audrey? Audrey? Audrey? [growling] [cackling laugh] Mrs. Adams? [laughter] All right, you guys, this is going to cost you. You guys want to find out about that manuscript, right? Well, good luck. [door slams] [growling] Who's there? William? [door slams] Hey. Let me out. [laughter] You scared me. [screaming] Oh, shit. Is she dead? My god. Witches and sorcerers often take possession of their intended prey by reciting ancient incantations. These words have the power to induce visions or hallucinations, which in turn manipulate-- [eerie music playing] [knocking] Will? Can I come in? Sure. You OK? Yeah, I'll be OK. I know something, son. It seems like one time or another everybody that ever touches us in our lives ends up leaving us or we have to leave them. And there's no getting used to that. I just wish I could understand it. I know. I know. Whatch you got. Audrey had this when she-- Does it mean anything? Will-- son, I think it's time that you-- you knew the truth. And it has to do with your real parents. The Churchills? Yes You know that you weren't really adopted. No, your mother and I-- we took you. I mean, we took you away from the people that were raising you. Why? Son, did-- did you ever get the feeling you were different than other kids? Yeah, all the time. Will-- Will, you are. Do you understand what Audrey was trying to tell you with this? [speaking latin] To unfold matters concealed in gloom far beneath the earth. These thieves and wild beasts that frequent these areas do not bother or distress me as much as the witches that agitate men's souls with their drugs and incantations-- Dad. Will, Will, your real parents and the parents that raised you before us, they were practicing-- Witchcraft? Yes. Yes. How did you know? You were one of them? Dad? Will, they were raising you, son. You were going to be their leader, their-- their supreme warlock. You were the one that was going to make them so powerful that no one on Earth could stop them from spreading their darkness over the Earth. We knew-- we knew their plans for you. And your mother and I-- I mean, we just fell in love with this-- this little baby. And we couldn't let them do that. So we ran away. And we took you with us. What about the ashtray? They founds us, Will. At least one of them has. Do we know which one has? No. No, they can take on anyone's identity. All I can tell you-- and you have to remember this-- a warlock can only be a male, and a witch can only be a female. But what do they want from me now? I don't know anything about casting spells. [doorbell] I'll get it. I'll get it, son. Oh, hi. I didn't even think you were home. I just wanted to make sure that William was all right. It was a terrible shock. Dolores. Why he's-- uh-- he's felling a lot better. William-- Will, come down for a second, will you, son? Oh, hi. Is everything OK? Anything I can do? Just going to take some time. I wonder where his mother is. I just saw her at the church. I'll go get her. I'll keep William company until you come back. Thank you. Is our food coming? I'm really not hungry. Well, you will be by the time it gets here. Do you have a phone? Yeah, it's over there. How convenient. Phone book? Yeah. [music playing] Is there a phone upstairs? Where? In my bedroom. Let's use that room. I don't think so. Why not? Michelle. I won't tell. I'll give you what you want. I'll give you what you want. I'll give you what you need. [music playing] No, no, no. No, no! No. I said no. Come back. You can't run away from your destiny. [music playing] REVEREND: William, well, good evening. Come in. Come in, please. Hi, Reverend. Is Michelle home. REVEREND: Well, she's here somewhere, probably upstairs. Look, come into the study. Let's talk for a minute. You all right. WILL: I don't know. I'm sorry about Audrey. Would you like to talk about it? WILL: I don't really know what to say. Nothing seems to make sense anymore. People I thought I knew-- [phone ringing] Hello. Mrs. Adams? Yeah, Will's here. He's just downstairs talking to my dad. Do you want to talk to him. No. Yeah, I'm sure he'll be home soon. We all had a rough day. Do you want me to tell him you called? No? OK. OK. Bye. [eerie music playing] You have to have faith, William. God has a purpose for everything, even if we don't understand. We must believe there's a higher purpose. [door slams] Daddy? [screams] WILL: Do you believe in witches? Witches? WILL: Yeah-- I-- I think Audrey was in to some of this occult stuff, and I'm just wondering-- [screaming] There is great evil and temptation in this world beyond anything we can imagine. If there's a heaven, then there's surely a hell. If God exists so does Satan. [screaming] But people can make their own choice. We're all free to cast our lot with one side or the other. But there are two forces within each of us. And we each a vice for one or the other. [screaming] Daddy! What happened? You all right? I don't know. What happened? There's somebody up there. [music playing] It wasn't anything I could see. Oh, my god. What do you know about this, William. This is what you were talking about before, isn't it? I don't understand. I-- It's the mark of the devil. But why Michelle. Are you the cause of this? [music playing] [door slams] William, you almost gave me a heart attack. I'm sorry, mom. I thought that-- It's all right. Go get cleaned up. Dinner's almost ready. I don't know. I'm really confused. It's all right. What's the problem? Something with Michelle? No. I'm talking about-- this. Are you ready to hear the truth? Ah. Do you remember this? No. It's your baby blanket. Look at this. Mom. I want to know about the Churchills. Oh, this certificate says that John and Grace Churchill are your parents. But that's not entirely correct. The truth of your heritage began almost 300 years ago. Two of your ancestors were said to be witches and burned at the stake. The woman was pregnant. What's that got to do with me? I want to know about my parents. The coven needed a woman pure and innocent. Your mother, Grace, she had no idea who her husband was. After you were born, he took you and your mother to live at your Grandmother Elizabeth's house. She too was one of us. That's when you mother learned the truth. [thunder claps] Elizabeth was the woman burned at the stake 300 years earlier with her husband. My father. But how could that be? You have brought back our child. You're sick. He's my child. He's our child. We are John and Elizabeth Stockton. And we have returned. You, Grace, you were just the vessel for the return of our child. Satan is most powerful when he inhabits such an angel of light. [cackling laughter] Grace killed your father. [moaning] And Elizabeth. MOTHER: And then herself. But she could not bring herself to kill you. Then I am from the devil. Why are you laughing? [laughing] --Why are you laughing? Stop it. You're not my mother. What did you do with my mother? William, bring forth that rage. You can't deny who you are. Feel it rattling through your bones. Will. Let her go. It's not Mom, Dad. It's not Mom. Let her go. WILL: Where's my mother? No, no, Will, no. That's right, I killed that old whore. Take that step. Cross over. Don't you love it? The evil. No, no, William, no. [music playing] Dad. Tomorrow night, you will be mine. [music playing] Dad. [sobbing roar] [dial tone] [phone ringing] [music playing] William, William, William, William, William, William, William, William, William, William, William, William. WILL: No. [heart beat] No. Please. Go away. Why are you doing this? Where's your mom and dad? They're dead. I killed them. They're witches, all of them-- my real parents, my adoptive parents and me. What do you mean? In their belief, in the reincarnation, I was born to be their leader. It's why they're after me. But Will, why would you-- why would you want to kill yourself? I mean, what sense does that make? How can you fight them if you're dead? I don't want to be one of them. You aren't. You're William Adams. And I love you. Will-- Will, you have a choice. We all have a choice between good and evil. She's coming for me tomorrow night. Grace Churchill, my poor mother, she didn't find out until it was too late. They used her. Just like they-- You mean your real mother wasn't a witch. No. My father-- he used her because she's pure and innocent. Will-- He made the spell-- Will, Will, Will, half of you is pure and good. Your mother's half. I know you feel that. I know you do. You have to hang on to it and make it dominant. You really don't know what you're talking about, do you? You don't understand. I can't resist her. Yes, you can. You can through Grace. Her spirit is yours. Do you really think so? Hang on to your life, Will. Don't make her wasted too. Will, and fight them for her. Oh, I love you, Michelle. I don't know what I'd do without you. I love you too. Are you OK? Yeah. Is Will OK? He's-- he's OK. It's going to be all right. Yeah. No, no, he's sleeping. He's sleeping. Come on in here. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. What are you doing? When she comes, we've got to be ready. It's going to take lots more than baseball bats or holy water. Hey, we have to try. MICHELLE: You look tired. There's a lot to do. We're going to be OK, aren't we? God willing. I just hope I did the sanctifying of the holy water correctly. I have a text on exorcism by Father Marin. Catholics are so much better at this than Methodists. I'm sure you did everything just fine. There's something I want to tell you. I just wanted you to know I've done the best I could since-- I know, since mom left. I know. You've been the best mother and father anyone could ever ask for. What good is that going to do? It'll keep her out of the house. I thought that was vampires. I think it's witches too. I have two more boxes back of the house. We'll need them. [crickets chirping] I'm worried about Daddy. He should have been here by now. [eerie music] God, help me. Michelle! How you doing? I can't get my mind off of Mom and Dad. I know. Do you really think that holy water is going to work. Have faith. [knocking] [eerie music] What the hell are you doing? Boomer, what are you doing here? I've been looking for you all day. Where you been. Listen, Boomer, I'm sorry about the water. I though you were somebody else. This is a really stupid joke. Hey, Boomer, this no joke. I really think that you should go. You're kidding? No. OK. [cackling laughter] No, Will. [speaking latin] What's it mean? [cackling laughter] [eerie music playing] Will, what's happening? [thunder clap] [dramatic music playing] [groans] [music playing] WILL: No. [screaming] [music playing] His seed. He will sire the next leader. His father was a great warlock. And now his son will fuck me. Our child will rule the world. No. You should have taken him when you could have. You left the door open for me. And now, he's mine. [eerie music playing] [speaking latin] [eerie music continues] [cackling laughter] Will. Will. Will. Don't stop. I need you know. I need you. [music playing] No. Will Yes. Yes. [roaring] [groaning] [screaming] [gentle music playing]
