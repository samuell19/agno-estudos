(screams) - No, no, no! (panting) - [Mrs. Barker] Superb, she is responding remarkably well. - [Mr. Hodge] But are you quite sure it's safe Mrs. Barker? I'm no medical man but it seems to me that she is on the verge of insanity. - [Mrs. Barker] No, it's standard conditioning procedure. You will not be deprived of what you want Mr. Hodge. Just see how the process is working. Totally different woman from the one we were observing a week ago. - Hello Mugs. Haven't you been fed yet, eh? - Hello Miss Davis. - Hello Lori. - I've marinated the steak. - Oh good. - And Mr. Pervine from Los Angeles-- - Oh yes? - Said he'd call back at 10. - All right. - All the packing is finished, your bags are ready. - Oh thank you Lori, well you can go home now. I'll see you in four weeks. Have you got the keys to the house? - Yes. Have a lovely holiday, Miss Davis. - Thank you Lori. Come on. There you are, baby. And you, Mr. Curt, can wait till morning. Come on. I prayed you'd called. - Why didn't you call me for Christ's sake? - I did, last bust up. Was your turn this time. (suspenseful music) - Her habits are reasonably regular. As Miss Daintree said earlier, she works most of the time, either at the office or at home. The man friend is an architect, Derek Whitelaw. Over the past month he's seen her three times a week. And on each occasion, has shared her bedroom with her for the evening. - You've definitely established that Miss Davis has no relatives? - Correct, Mrs. Barker. The last remaining relative, an aunt, passed away last year. - But soon, I trust, I shall be her relative. What a mating that will be. The two greatest families reunited. - Only with her consent. - She'll consent. - The final thing is the holiday. - Is the architect going with her? - No sir, he can't get away. - Then we have four weeks, whatever her reaction. - It'll be positive. With a family as noble as hers, I'm sure the old, the old thirst will not have died out. - Do stop deceiving yourself Dr. Fraser. She's a strong willed woman. We may have to use force. (cat meowing) - There you are. OK, OK, just a minute. (phone ringing) Yes. - [Derek] Hi. - Oh hi. - [Derek] When's your plane? - Well I don't have to leave the house till about 12. Derek, ah, could you come over for a while? - Oh look, I could think of nothing nicer, but I've gotta finish these plans. Look, I'm well aware that it's Saturday morning. Katie, how've you got your hair? - Up. - Freckles? - Still there. - Look, now you have a good holiday, all right? And rest, no work, you understand? - Don't go yet. - Look, I have all this work to get through. - [Kate] Oh, the bloody cat, look all right. Bye. - Bye. - All right Mugs, what are you up to? Jesus. What are you doing, get out! Get out of it. (hisses) Stop that! (high pitched whine) - I knew the reaction would be negative. She should have gone under conditioning from the start. - Conditioning has nothing to do with it. She's just strong willed. Probably end up spending a fortune on her, achieving nothing. Except, perhaps, drive her insane. - [Dr. Gauss] Kate, this is our symbol. Does it mean anything to you? - Of course it doesn't. - I wonder, Kate, whether you're evading the issue. Whether you begin to suspect why we brought you here. - That's exactly what I want to know. - Tell me all you know about your ancestry. - Look I've had enough. Now tell me what I'm doing here and what you want from me. - All right, Kate, I'll explain to you. You're unaware that your great, great-grandfather's name was Dotkin? - So what? - And that he changed it to Davis in 1850 when the family went to settle in Boston. And that Herr Dotkin was a direct descendent of Countess Elizabeth Bathery? - There's a legacy, that's it, isn't it? Look, you can have it. Please take it. - Yes there is a legacy, to you from Elizabeth Bathery. Your ancestress. Do you see her medallion? Hyma, the Greek sign for human blood. Welcome to the brotherhood, Miss Davis. Baroness. - This is not happening. - Good morning. How do we feel today? Careful it's hot. - You bitch. You rotten bitch. - Vampires we dislike that word. The brotherhood is something far nobler than peasant superstitions give me credit for. There's nothing supernatural about us Kate. - No, we're simply a superior race of people who, over the centuries, have proved that the drinking of the vital human essence confers youth, power. It's the ultimate aristocratic act. - [Loudspeaker] Would any member of groups R, S, and T who have not yet reported for their tranquilizer shots, please do so immediately. Groups R, S, and T. - Seventy thousand of you? - Of us, Kate, all round the world. - Where does it all come from, your drink? - These are our donors. Does the truth still frighten you so much? This is a farm, Kate, in the fullest sense. One of many farms. - You're all mad. - I see reason is not enough. There's only one way. - Ow, oh, ow. - Kate? Kate, can you hear me? - Yes. - You're going on a little journey now. - Where? - [Mrs. Barker] You'll wake up there. It's a place where bad girls go. Bad girls go. - Good evening. - Closer. - Superb, she is responding remarkably well. - Are you quite sure it's safe Mrs. Barker? I'm no medical man, but it seems to me that she's on the verge of insanity. - No it's standard conditioning procedure. You will not be deprived of what you want, Mr. Hodge. A totally different woman from the one we were observing a week ago. - Who authorized this? - I did. When you're away Dr. Fraser, I'm in charge. - Let her out. You could've killed her. - No, she's resilient. - It's absolutely unnecessary, there is no need to subject her to that kind of indignity. Kate? Kate? It's all right. Someone will come and let you out at once. - Look what gives you the right to put me through this? - Kate I am deeply sorry for what's happened. But the most important thing at the moment is that you get as much rest as you can. - Don't give me that. What were they trying to do to me? - Look. Look, I realize there must be a lot of things that you find difficult to understand. and I will explain in time. - But I don't want to be here. - I also promise you that what you've been through I will never allow to happen again. Just trust me. - Why should I trust you? - Look around, everybody's happy here. The farm's a bit like a commune, really. It's all right Kate. I wouldn't have it any other way. - Are they free to leave? - They can't leave. - Why not? - It's essential that they stay. Come on. - You're very lucky. Dr. Gauss has taken a real liking to you. - [Loudspeaker] Attention please. Attention please. Would all members of groups A, J, L, and Q please enter the vans. Attention please, attention please. Groups A, J, L, and Q. Groups A, J, L, and Q. Attention please, attention please. Groups A, J, L, and Q please enter the vans. Attention all process workers shift change in 15 minutes. Attention all process workers attention all process workers shift change in 15 minutes. (screams) (siren beeping) - Dr. Gauss I must talk to you. - Check with sterilization. - Dr. Fraser's program of so-called persuasion will fail. As I insisted from the start, there's only one solution. - Under no circumstances. - Eric you must admit there have been no signs of change. - Call a committee meeting. I insist on a vote. - Look, if she comes to us of her own accord she'll be ours much, much, much more wholeheartedly. Now you must unlock her door. - Look, you let me out and I walk. That doesn't mean I accept what you're doing here. - Listen Kate, I bought time for you this morning. Use it wisely. Just go anywhere you like, get to know us. - Where are those people going? - I expect they're shiners. I've been privileged to have your people drink here. - My people? - Excuse me, I'm David. Leah and I, Leah and I are friends. Leah, the other day when you came through, the one you chose. - I never chose anyone. - We all assumed. They took her away right after. I just had to tell you. She's not very strong. Please, don't drink too much. (dramatic music) (panting) (chickens clucking) - Excuse me, do you have a phone? My car's broken down. Or, look, can you drive me to the nearest town? I'll pay, I'll pay a lot. Can I buy that truck? Do you hear me? I'll pay you $5,000. Please. Please? - [All] Hey! (engine sputters) - You all right? - Yes thank you, I'm just filling up. - Are you from the farm? - Yes, yes I am. - Sure I can't help you sister? - Ah, no thank you, I'm just finishing off. - OK, hope we see you at the festival. - OK. (honking) (engine stalling) - Kate, how nice. She was on her way to greet the convoy. Ride back with us. I'll ask a man to return the truck. Wasn't it kind of Mr. Dichter to lend it to you? - [Mr. Hodge] Not our Dichter? - [Mrs. Barker] Yes. - Who are those people? - They're our visitors for the festival. They come here from all over the world. - Tonight's the opening ceremony and I'll be officiating. You're, ah, you're more than welcome to come. - Yes you must join us Kate. - [Loudspeaker] Attention please, attention please. Would all visitors wishing to tour the processing complex please board the bus. - Chief reason for the establishment of the dairy in 1939 was the brotherhood's growing concern about the health of its members. Such diseases as malaria, hepatitis, and anaphylactic shock, which is the result of drinking blood containing allergy-producing penicillin, but common amongst traditional drinkers. The dairy brings our lifestyle up to date. Each carefully selected blood cow is accompanied to the village by an elaborate medical file. Before the blood is tapped and cartonned, each donor is placed on a stringent diet and subjected to scrupulous hematological tests for any blood contaminants. We ensure that all packaged blood is absolutely free from anti-tetanus serum, pollens, and antibiotics, any of which may produce hyper-immune reactions to certain drinkers. Move along now please. (choir singing) (dramatic music) (screams) - You were invited to that ceremony, we'd have prepared you for it. Increasingly Kate you seem determined to create difficulties. - We should leave her alone, she needs time. - Already you've come dangerously close to spoiling things for others. Mr. Dichter, for example, at the chicken farm. The Hodge's chose him for our highest honor. If they'd even suspected that he tried to help you to escape. - I stole that truck. - You must understand that the merest question mark would have disqualified him. Happily I was able to keep the incident quiet. - If I made trouble for that old man, I'm sorry. - Now you're being constructive. Don't feel sorry for him. It's the highest service a prisoner can render, to be exsanguinated, drained. - Let me out! (screams) - [Mrs. Barker] Orderly. - [Kate] Get off me! (mumbles) - [Nurse] They're from Dr. Fraser. - Put them down and wait. If only you'd talk things out. You would've come to understand why you're flying so violently in the face of your instincts. And they are your instincts. We've done a lot of research on you, Kate. You holiday'd at your uncle's pig farm when you were 11, remember? And you saw pigs slaughtered? What emotion did that arouse in you, when you saw throats slashed? Blood. - It made me feel sick. - Your reaction was normal. All of our people brought up outside have difficulty accepting their natural feelings. So they hide them beneath a mask of revulsion. - Ah! (heavy breathing) - I'm going to help you in two ways Kate. Not just to live with your instincts but to enjoy-- - [Kate's thoughts] I can't breathe. - Don't be frightened Kate. What do you see? Who? - [Kate's thoughts] Derek. - You want Derek? I'll send for him if you like. - [Kate's thoughts] Help! - [Mrs. Barker] Derek, Kate's calling for you. We've edited her two days of reminiscence into a fairly representative 90 minutes. Before I play it through, Dr. Gauss will take you over the psychometer chart. This shows the chief areas of weakness, how we intend to exploit them. - [Dr. Fraser] You can't put her through that in two weeks. - [Dr. Gauss] The dangers of psychic engineering are exaggerated. The New York experiments have shown that the relief periods which precede each intensification, do generally keep the patient's sanity intact. - [Dr. Fraser] She's still in narcosis? - Hi. It's lunchtime. - Where is this? - Hm, what are you talking about? - I've got a headache. And my arm stings. - Well I couldn't blame an ant for having a bite of you. - Derek! - Kate. - I thought-- (romantic music) Derek, you always forget the salt. - I didn't forget it. Don't you know it's poisonous? - Hypochondriac. - Ah. - Where's the car? - It's where we left it. - Funny I don't remember us driving here. What day is it? - You all right Kate? - Oh, it's weird. I thought I'd lost you. - Hm, hm, now, now we eat. (horror music) Derek? - [Derek] It's good Kate. Drink it. It's love. It's youth. It's power. - Derek? - You have honored me Baroness. (thunder claps) - Miss Davis, what's happened? You're frozen, come in. I put the heater on. Come, come Miss Davis. We must get you out of those wet clothes. - Lori. How long have I been away? - Beg pardon miss? - How many days? - Let me get a doctor. - I don't want a doctor. - But miss, you only left the house an hour ago for work. - Oh Lori, it really is you. - Oh miss. Come, come. You go ahead miss, I'll get you some dry clothes. (dribbling) (screams) You mustn't be ashamed miss. You're getting the thirst, that's all. The thirst is in all of us. - Not in me. Not me. Not me. - [Mrs. Barker] Don't be upset Kate. You'll love boarding school. Lots of other five year olds to play with. And mummy will come and see you whenever she can. Kate. Wake up Kate. I'm so sorry to tell you this Kate, but your mother, your mother won't be coming back. She died. - Mother? - [Mrs. Barker] You must forget the past now Kate. Cut your ties with the past. - Mother? (people whispering) Mother? - [Mrs. Barker] Your mother is dead Kate. The past is dead. - Mrs. Barker! Where are you? Please? I know you're watching me. - [Lori] Miss Davis? Miss Davis, drink. - Lori! Lori I know you're here. Lori. - Yes Miss Davis? - Lori please help me. (banging) (growling) (banging) (creaking) (banging) This is happening. (choir singing) - Gentlemen, on the 14th and final day of programming, she has no memory of her previous experiences. But as you can see, she's deeply conditioned. Notice the reflex cupping of the hands, the questing. She now senses that somewhere there is a key to her dilemma without being aware of what it is. When that key is presented to her, she now recognizes it, Dr. Fraser, rejoices in it. - Hm, well, let us hope that in spite of all this we're still able to earn her respect. (choir singing) (people talking) * Hyma * Perpetuis * Photis * Vanium * Hyma * Hyma * Hyma * Perpetuis * Sablan * Votaris * Hyma in Perpetuis - This is your destiny Kate. Destiny. * Hyma * Perpetuis (choir singing) - Hyma perpetuis. (people talking) - Destiny Kate, destiny. (choir singing) - [Mrs. Barker] I'm by no means convinced that she is ours yet. The real test is how her indoctrination stands up in the outside world. - Miss Pearson from the office, miss. - Oh thank you Lori. Martha, hello. - I expected to find you in bed. - What with all this work I've got to do? - Well it was supposed to be a sick call, but I brought this just in case. - I think you know me too well. - What does the doctor say? - Oh he thinks I've got some sort of virus. I just don't feel like eating anything. Yet at the same time I feel hunger. I don't even feel like I've had a holiday. And I keep having these dreams. It's almost as if, hey Martha, how long has Lori worked for me? - A year. - Back to work. Most urgently to Ted Hearst. Now can you please send us the new lipstick peg designs and color charts? (typing) Right, these bunch seem fine to me. They can be sent off to the legal department. - Right. - Oh Martha, we've been working for two hours and I haven't even offered you coffee. - I'll get some. - No, no, I'm the hostess here. - Miss Davis, shall I send a copy of the contract with this letter? Miss Davis? Is there something you want? What are you doing? (Martha screams) (Kate screams) - Let me see, let me see! - Oh I had another bad dream. Was it a dream? - Come on. Come on, I'll get you a warm drink or something. - No Derek, stay with me. No! Leave it on. - [Derek] Good night. I love you. (Derek screams) - Oh Derek, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, I'm sorry. - We have failed. She remains in a state of confusion. - As long as her feelings are mixed she's liable to run to someone and confess. Everything that we've built up here would be lost. Even for the descendent of so noble a family the risk isn't worth taking. We must start on more conditioning immediately. - I won't allow that. I don't think she could take it. - Save your arguments for tomorrow's committee meeting. The chairman will be there. He'll decide. - Another danger? - No, Derek's all right. He'll come around. - Where's Derek? - It's all right, he's being looked after. Why don't you get into bed. Hm? Let's have a look at you. - What's happening to Derek? - Kate, they're not satisfied with the way that the conditioning's been going. They're having a meeting tomorrow and I think the vote will go against you. I'm going to try and get you out. - You'd go against them? - It's a clear choice. Either with the will of the rebel or serve. - I'm not leaving here without Derek. - That's impossible, it's already too much of a risk. All right, I'll come for you in the morning. And get some rest. - Dr. Fraser, good morning. - Morning. Thought you'd be finished by now. - Well I just have, actually. Mrs. Barker is still working. I was coming to phone you. I just wanted you to know that, ah, I'll be voting on your side. - Can we discuss this later? I've got a patient. It's all right, it's all right. - Who are you? - There's a hut in the bush. I'm gonna take and hide you there. Kate will join us later. - Why, why are you helping me? - I'm helping Kate. OK, come on. You stay as close to me as you can. Come on. (dramatic music) - Well, well, well, Dr. Fraser. A bit early to be taking the prisoner for his morning walk, isn't it? This man is an A security prisoner. Show me his release authorization. - Run! (screams) - Help, help! (siren blaring) - Dr. Fraser, there's a blockage in No. 3 vat. - Yes, all right contact Dr. Gauss. Tell him that, ah, tell him I'll be here in two minutes. - Eric, Eric! They need you back in the dairy. There's a block in the main vat. You can't take her! - Get back! (dramatic music) (screams) - Mr. Hodge, I've found it, what's causing the blockage. - Where are we going now? - Well we have to stay undercover. I have a place. - Dr. Fraser, thank you. - You'll find that there are a lot of people like me who are willing to serve. You'll see Derek very soon. The house is just over here. This is my secret retreat. Had it for 10 years. Through there. - [Kate] Derek? - [Dr. Fraser] It's all right, we'll be with him shortly. - Derek? Derek? - And no one but you shall drink a drop of him. - No. Turn that off. I said turn that off! Derek, Derek. Now get out. Get out! Derek, Derek, I'm sorry. I'm sorry Derek, Derek. I'm sorry, Derek. Derek. I'm sorry Derek. Please. Please give me another chance. - Photis vanium Disirupt hyma. - Please, let me, let me be one of you. I am. I am one of you. I am one of you. - [Mr. Hodge] I am one of you, at last. I knew your conditioning program would succeed in the end, Dr. Fraser. As head of the Hodge family, I will be forever indebted to you. As a result of your work, our two greatest families will be permanently united. You have my deepest admiration, Dr. Fraser. - [Dr. Fraser] I did only that which was necessary to ensure her happiness.
