Lakes, moreover, form more or less closed systems, Lakes, moreover, form more or less closed systems, so that they provide a series of varying possible ecological worlds a series of varying possible ecological worlds which permit a truly comparative approach which permit a truly comparative approach to the mechanics of nature. It is in the study of the lake as a microcosm It is in the study of the lake as a microcosm that much of the intellectual significance of limnology lies, that much of the intellectual significance of limnology lies, and this significance grows geometrically as a whole series of comparable, as a whole series of comparable, yet different microcosms become available.

On my index finger, On my index finger, the Caspian Sea isn't landlocked, the Caspian Sea isn't landlocked, and the Pacific is the Rudawa's meek tributary, and the Pacific is the Rudawa's meek tributary, that same stream that floated in a little cloud over Paris that same stream that floated in a little cloud over Paris in the year seven hundred and sixty-four in the year seven hundred and sixty-four on the seventh of May at three a.m. There are not enough mouths to utter all your fleeting names, O water. I would have to name you in every tongue, I would have to name you in every tongue, pronouncing all the vowels at once while also keeping silent for the sake of the lake for the sake of the lake that still goes unnamed and doesn't exist on this earth, just as the star reflected in it just as the star reflected in it is not in the sky. Someone was drowning, Someone was drowning, someone dying was calling out for you. someone dying was calling out for you. Long ago, yesterday. You have saved houses from fire, you have carried off houses you have carried off houses and trees, forests and towns alike. You've been in christening fonts and courtesan's baths.

There are many stories about the city There are many stories about the city that sank to the bottom of the lake. For years and years, fishermen have been dragging out pieces of wood fishermen have been dragging out pieces of wood that look like parts of the church tower. that look like parts of the church tower. If, on a peaceful Sunday morning, If, on a peaceful Sunday morning, you floated over the place where the city used to be, you would still hear the ringing of the bells. you would still hear the ringing of the bells. I want to set down here all I remember about that blessed man who filled the deepest part of my soul. He was tall, slender, and proud. He held his head like our mountain carried its crest. He held his head like our mountain carried its crest. In his eyes was the deepest blue of our lake. In his eyes was the deepest blue of our lake. And the things he told us! And the things he told us! They were ideas, not words. How he cared for his people! He showed the same affection to everyone. No one wanted to die without holding his hand, like an anchor. without holding his hand, like an anchor. The most important thing is for people to be happy, The most important thing is for people to be happy, to be happy to be alive. They say that at the bottom of the lake They say that at the bottom of the lake there is a sunken village. On one night each year, you can hear the bells of its church. On one night each year, you can hear the bells of its church. I believe that in the deepest part of his soul, there is also a sunken village. And sometimes the people can hear its bells. And sometimes the people can hear its bells. On the shortest night of the year, they would gather by the shore. they would gather by the shore. And he would take the task of being the lake himself. A restorative bathing place, an alleviation, a cure. This is how life flows here. He said miracles were for someone else. There is a geography of miracles, There is a geography of miracles, no less than of animals and plants. He tried to avoid having nothing to do. He tried to avoid having nothing to do. When it was harvest time, When it was harvest time, he would go to the threshing place to thresh and winnow. In the winter, he chopped wood for poor families. With his constant activity, he seemed to want to escape from himself and from solitude. from himself and from solitude. Oh, that I could change the water from our lake into wine. Oh, that I could change the water from our lake into wine. No matter how much of it the people drank, No matter how much of it the people drank, they would always be happy. He used to say, "I'm afraid of solitude." But even so, from time to time he went by himself to the ruins by the shore. to the ruins by the shore. And on the walls they say you can still see And on the walls they say you can still see the drops of blood that splattered on them. What could he have been thinking there? I saw a kind of deep sadness in his eyes that were as blue as the water. that were as blue as the water. Let's give them opium, and let them sleep and dream. and let them sleep and dream. He had a marvellous voice, a divine voice, that made one want to weep. a divine voice, that made one want to weep. His words went to rest over the lake, His words went to rest over the lake, and at the foot of the mountain. And a deep tremor spread through the entire village. Like the one that passed through the water of the lake on days when there was a strong north wind. Let them dream their life, Let them dream their life, like the lake dreams the stars. After seeing his sadness, After seeing his sadness, I felt uncomfortable to find myself alone with him. He seemed aware of what I was feeling and what might have caused it. When I finally went to see him, both of us bent our heads in silence. both of us bent our heads in silence. It was him who broke that painful silence to tell me, with a voice that seemed to rise out of a tomb. with a voice that seemed to rise out of a tomb. "Do you believe?" I believe. "I do not." "I do not." "What do you believe?" Here the river forms a lake, enclosed by old beech trees, enclosed by old beech trees, their branches touching the water. their branches touching the water. When we were walking along the shore of the lake, he said to me: he said to me: "Here you can see my greatest temptation." He wasn't sure when it started, He wasn't sure when it started, but he always had to struggle against it. He described terrible things. It seemed like madness. He said, "Now I am tempted by this water, with its apparent calmness that mirrors the sky." with its apparent calmness that mirrors the sky." All is silent here. All is silent here. Until everything begins to fill with life again, at this very spot. at this very spot. One night they were returning from the lake One night they were returning from the lake when there was a full moon. The surface was rippling under the wind while the rays of moonlight were dancing in the ripples. while the rays of moonlight were dancing in the ripples. And two separate tears fell from their eyes into the grass. And two separate tears fell from their eyes into the grass. Like the dew, they trembled in the light of the full moon. Like the dew, they trembled in the light of the full moon. And somewhere far out in the world, And somewhere far out in the world, in Iceland, in Java, things start to rumble and pitch. things start to rumble and pitch. As time passed, we noticed that his strength was beginning to lessen. He was no longer able to control the deep sadness that consumed him. Perhaps some mysterious sickness Perhaps some mysterious sickness was eating away at his body and his soul. And the people also began to notice that he was tiring. When he talked about the other world, he had to stop for a moment and close his eyes. The ash that rains down from the Hawaiian volcanoes is carried far out to sea. is carried far out to sea. I stood up feeling weak, like a somnambulist. All day long I wondered. I went to see him. I went to see him. He looked like he had reached the twilight of his life. He looked like he had reached the twilight of his life. He told me, "Doing well and deceiving well is never lost, not even in dreams..." is never lost, not even in dreams..." They say rising water is nothing special, it happens almost every day. We stayed close to him. We stayed close to him. He listened in silence. There was no need to close his eyes. There was no need to close his eyes. When he died, they were already closed. When something bigger happens out there, When something bigger happens out there, like it did those hundred years ago in Lisbon, the water bubbles and overflows. the water bubbles and overflows. Everyone hoped to see him every day. Everyone hoped to see him every day. Passing along the side of the lake Passing along the side of the lake with the mountains reflected in it. Everyone kept hearing his voice. Everyone went to his grave. He became one more link between the two villages. He became one more link between the two villages. The one at the bottom of the lake, The one at the bottom of the lake, and the one on the surface reflected in it. And a red rooster rises to the surface and crows And a red rooster rises to the surface and crows with all its might across the land. Have I really lost them? Have I really lost them? Have I really grown older? I never felt the days and years change, I never felt the days and years change, any more than the waters of the lake. any more than the waters of the lake. It seemed to me as if my life had always been the same. It seemed to me as if my life had always been the same. And as I write this now, it is snowing And as I write this now, it is snowing over the lake and over the mountain. Snowing over the memories of my father, my mother, my brother, of him. my mother, my brother, of him. And the snow covers the streets and takes away the shadows, since snow can even illuminate the night. since snow can even illuminate the night. I don't know what is true and what is a lie, I don't know what is true and what is a lie, nor what I saw, or what I dreamed. Can things like these really happen? Can things like these really happen?
