SEDUCTION & SNACKS Gavin! Gavin! Let's go... Yeah, you need to go to bed. Gavin! Gavin! Gavin! That's Gavin. I'm Claire. And I am never having kids. I made this decision after the video we saw in health class in school. The one set back in the 70's that had some woman screaming "Bloody Murder" with sweat dripping off her face. While the husband lovingly patted her forehead with the towel and told her she was doing great. Then the camera panned down to the crime scene between her legs. While most of the girls around me were saying: "Aw..." when the baby started to cry, I looked around at them in repulsion. What the hell is wrong with you people? I am never having children. I'm never having children. So Claire, did you choose a major yet? I'm never having children. I'm never having children. Too bad no one told 20-year-old me that she and her mantra were about to get pregnant. Yep, that's her. Somewhere in my head, sipping imaginary Merlot, talking like she knows shit about shit. And... that's me. Twenty-five. My son Gavin is four and a half. And 20-year-old me's silly ass is about to get a morbidly obese dose of that saying that goes something like how when you plan, God laughs. Because God is a dick. Well, he's everything technically, so it's okay that I call him that. God's a dick. God is a beautiful tree. God's a frat party the last semester of my sophomore year at University of Ohio that 20-year-old me is walking right into with her best friend Liz. Why are Liz and I walking into a frat house instead of... anywhere? Because we're on a mission. My mission. To finally... lose my stupid, pesky virginity. And while I know this isn't the only place on Earth to find a horny male, I don't want a relationship, and I don't want any distractions. So I'm taking Liz's quicker approach which she assures me we'll find in here. Hey, what about him? He's cute. He has good teeth. Jeez, Liz, he's not a horse. You can ride him all night long if you play your cards right. Okay, two tango staring us at your six. Okay... If you sneeze, there's gonna be a nip slip, so you better put those away before you poke someone's eye out. â€œI'm not a gyno, but I'll take a look." Well, that sounds DTF! Damn it, Liz. Hello, ladies. Hi! This is Claire... And you are? Me? No. Sorry. The shirt. Oh, my God. I can take it off. He was beautiful. I wanted to punch my own face for calling a guy beautiful, but it was true. I wanted to frame him and put him on my bed stand in a non-creepy, non-Hannibal Lecter kind of way. He didn't wanna be here any more than I did. I could introduce myself and tell him he was my soul mate. Look! Oops... Sorry! Uninvited chick. Jesus, what's your damage, Heather? Did you just quote the movie Heathers? That's my favorite movie ever. I had a huge crush on Winona before the whole shoplifting thing. My name isn't Heather. Winona... Wow. I kinda have a thing for quirky, intelligent dark-haired chicks. You smell like chocolate. Why are you calling me Heather? I always do... He knows my name is Nikki. Nikki? Hello? Nikki! Your voice is making my ears bleed and you're killing my buzz.. You wanna... play beer bong or something? I wanna reach into my pants, pull up my virginity, wrap it up and put a bow on it. Or maybe stick it in gift bag from Target and give it to you... Oh, shit, don't say it out loud. Beer pong... Sure. All right. I really didn't think anything about this night was gonna feel good. Enjoying myself was a small perk I didn't expect. No, leave it. I got it, I got it. Oh, my God. This is really happening. Yes! My answer is yes! Are you okay? - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Take your pants off. Zipper! Ok, ready, ready... Whoa! - Are you okay? All right. - Yeah. I wanted it to last forever. I saw stars. I came three times that night and it was the most amazing experience of my... Yeah, no. It hurts like a mother-f'er and it's awkward and messy. It was like naked jury duty. And the only "stars" I saw were the ones behind my eyelids as I tried to think of a happy place. But let's be honest here. He was as sweet and gentle as he possibly could be. Under the circumstances. But it was perfect. He was perfect. And that's how I left him. With the state of my virginity out of the way, I could focus more on school and my career and Liz would stop treating every party like it was a meat market. We never even told each other our names. It happened and it all went according to plan. Pregnant - Not Pregnant Till that... Open another one! - Claire... - Just do it, bitch! Girl, I'm sorry. What am I gonna do, Liz? What do I do? Let's bake. Bake? Bake what, a time machine? Let's hit the store and we'll make some of your famous sweets, I'll help. Major McGillicutty's Crispy Goodness Globs are not gonna change anything! To sell. On campus, to raise a couple hundred bucks? And it hit me. As much as an abortion bake sale may have worked. As much as I wanted it all to go away. As much as I'm all for a woman's right to choose. It wasn't any bitter resentment of tiny humans that created my lack of desire to press one out. Sometimes I blamed it on my mom's lack of parenting skills. Mommy, that mean boy on the swings punched me. Claire, don't piss down my back and tell me it's raining! Go tell him you're sorry. Mom, can I get a new backpack? Sure, honey, just find me two nickels to pull a dime out of a duck's ass! Buy the vowel! Where are you going? Just forty minutes away, baby, we'll see each other. Your dad never takes me anywhere. You'll get it when you have kids. I need a life. Doodles. Didn't matter. Adoption. Leaving it on some random doorstep like Benjamin Button. Really, there were plenty of choices. And I chose to redefine what I thought of when I heard the word "mom". I'd think... "Oh, shit. That's me." Then let's find him. Who the hell basically tells a guy to deflower her and never asks him his name? Oh, yeah, now I remember. Thanks. It was a whole new mission for the next two months. Kind of quiet, mysterious, more a Edward than a Jacob. A what? But I knew what I had to do when it was over. And there's where the life I had planned officially said toodles. Toodly-doo, my dearly departed scholarship. And hello... Butler, Ohio... Again. Hello, all that I left behind. Hello, what Mom escaped. Hello, the opposite of what people mean when they say they wanna go "see the world". Hello, Wiggly Pig, I missed you. Just kidding. Yeah... Hello, living vicariously through Liz as she finishes our formerly shared degree in small business and fills me in on her relationship with Jim, who's now moved into our formerly shared apartment. I gotta go, I love you! Okay, bye! Hello, 21st birthday, which I'd always seen going like... I am drunk, fuckers! But went more like... You fuckers! Least I'd never forget his birthday. Hello, Dad. - Single mom. Be respectful. - Okay, boomer. Goodbye, dates. What? Oh, God! Hello, making arrangements of cookies and sweets for neighbors instead of opening the sweet shop I'd always dreamed of. Hello, getting my high school job as a waitress back at good ole Foster's Family Bar and Grill. Hello, same customers from before who sound so genuinely sweet when they congratulate me on being promoted to bartender now that I'm finally a grownup. Hello, heading home knowing Gavin doesn't speak enough yet to quite get the phrase "Mommy's tired". And hello to always being grateful. 'Cause not every girl who fails to check a Trojan's expiration date has somewhere to come home to. Not every girl has a supportive dad and healthy baby. Not every girl's lucky. Like me. Which was why I couldn't complain. Ever. To anyone. Kiddo, are you hurt? Are you okay? Someone in the house? Is someone...? Oh, those are... Oh, good screams. - Those are good screams. - Yes! - Good... God! - It's good! Women are fuckin' nuts, huh? Hey, watch that shit. It was the best thing I'd heard in five years. Liz had gotten engaged. Liz was starting a business. Liz was moving back to Butler! It's hideous. The next few weeks are gonna be nothing but going from the space to the courthouse to the lawyer... God, I sound like a... Like an adult. Okay, fuckyface, the dishes are done. And you can clean the rest for your hangover present, yeah? Ten-four, man-whore. - 'Night, Claire. - Good night, Jim! Can I please have your life? I didn't mean it that way. I know. No, I'm sorry. No, you're fine. No, no, I'm... I'm sorry. I don't wanna be that friend that makes you feel like you have to put your life on hold just because it sounds like I need a drunken girls night. - It's stupid. - Stupid? You've been here for years raising a kid on your own. Dad never leaves the house. There's always a babysitter. The only dick you've seen that wasn't on a changing table was that guy that flashed you at Dillard's. Yes, he got tackled away by the security guard and he wasn't all that bad looking. He was kind of a chubby, sad Jason Statham. Claire. I'm your best friend. You can bitch to me. - No, I'm fine. - Let out. Let it out. I'm fine. I'm fine. Let it out. Oh, my God, my life is shit! Yes! Good! Tell me more! Other parents won't talk to me and Dad won't listen about him and Gavin not watching the same movies! Every night I come back from a shift he is cussing more! Give me an example. He told Dr. Bob to suck off! The pediatrician? And it never ends. Ever! He sleep talks at nap-time in pre-school! And every mom has a lame excuse as to why my child can't play with yours, and I just wanna tell them that he doesn't have a father and my frontal lobe is still developing so they can take pity on him and get him the hell out of my house so he can actually see what real parents look like! He's obsessed with his weiner. "Mommy, does a bus have a weiner?" "Mommy, does that hamburger have a weiner?" "Mommy, do you have a weiner?" He even told me he just walks up to me in the middle of a night with his hand in his pants. And he says, "Look, Mommy, it's getting getting 'big and weird' again!" Why didn't anybody tell me that a four-year-old could get a woody? In what world does that happen? And all my dad does is laugh at me, and I just... I can't... What's happening? I can't... I can't do this! Oh, my God, my kid is really mad, I don't know what I'm gonna do. Oh, my God... It's okay, it's okay. Claire! Don't let the vodka win! Okay... You should try Tinder! Fine. Have you... Have you just given up on finding... him? I still see him every day when I look into Gavin's eyes. And his laugh's starting to sound like his. As to locating him, well... I guess life kinda just got in the way. And what about your career? No more sweet shop? No, I'm... I'm saving everything... I just pictured applying for a loan with a degree to show. Well, what if I told you that I might have a small partnership opportunity for you? Where I'd be doing...? Sales. Liz... I have a list of clientele ready for a little party, small, local, Friday... 8pm. Is this something illegal? In a Handmaid's Tale type of world. Trust me? When have you steered me wrong? Okay, so, I'll be home usual time. Cool, we're gonna watch Fight Club. Hell no, you're not gonna watch Fight Club. Hell, kiddo, it's basically a bedtime story by now. Enjoy. Bye, hon. DRESS SLUTTY! I love that. Okay, take it off, first impressions are very important. What are we selling? - One second. - Now! Seriously? What? I bought it to bartend on Halloween and I chickened out! Okay then, Captain Jack... off. Oh, thank you, now I'm feeling so much sexier! Okay, you know what... Hey... just own it! We're gonna cash in. I promise. - Hi. - Hey! How are you? Evening, ladies! So, unlike many of your husbands, I'm not gonna beat around the bush! Around the... Yeah, okay. So, let's see what Cuntalicious Claire is holding! Can you hold that up a little higher there, girlfriend? Spank you! This is the Pink Pussy Eater. And it has four speeds: "Yes, More, Faster Blaster, and Holy Shit-Balls". Yeah. You can't ignore me forever, Claire. Quit being a dick. Speaking of dick, really, Liz? Oh, God, I'm funny! At what point of our relationship did you ever think that I would wanna sell pocket pussies? You don't have to sell forever, I already found someone... And another thing... pocket pussies? Claire, quit being such a drama queen. Think about it. What was the one thing you noticed that they were missing from the party tonight? Dignity? Ha-ha, very funny. Liz, you know this place. How many times that The Fosters told me that it was a "family restaurant" because of Gavin's public potty mouth? I mean, how do you think they'll react when they find out that I'm doing this with my spare time? Get in the car. What? Get in the car! Wow! - So this is your... - Ours. Nice, huh? I sign the paper work tomorrow, I'd like for you to be there so the co-ownership... Whoa-whoa. What do you mean by "ours"? I've looked everywhere for a building for my business. My realtor called and said that the owner of Andrea's... bakery retired when she found a buyer. Liz! With one sheet of dry wall, we'll have enough space for two connecting businesses. My sex toys and your desserts. I didn't tell you the drill tonight because I knew you wouldn't come, and I needed you to see what they'd be missing. Men? No. Nobody needs a man to help them pick out their fucking vibrator. Nobody needs a man unless they're trying to open a jar. Okay, I... And not want a man? Great. And if you're getting off either way, you'll likely be more relaxed and confident so then when you do go looking for a man, you'll find a good man instead of settling for a cock attached to a gigantic asshole. And that is what I'm selling, my friend. Relaxation and confidence. What they were missing tonight were the snacks. Well, good snacks at least. Well, there was a table of... No, they were shit. There were some crackers and a cheese ball, the type you find in a PTA meeting you know, with the baby dick carrots and the jizzy dip, the kind that you bring just to say that you brought something? Claire, nothing goes better with sex than chocolate. Liz, I don't... I can't believe you, I mean... The money and... You run your side and I'll run mine, and we will always have each other's backs. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this. You know my grandfather's trust is burning a hole through my pocket, okay? So let's not worry about the money, let's go back to class and hear my pitch. Okay. What is the last word you would use to describe Butler? Sexy. I love it here. You're here, my mom and sister are here. - But I don't wanna die of boredom. - No. And this town could use a naughty little secret. We could be the one-stop-shop for the two best things on the planet: seduction and snacks. Is that a gumball machine? Is that a yes? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes! Yes! - Yeah? Spacious stalls, think we found our new place. Please don't share what you saw in your shit. I won't now. What crawled up your ass and declared war? I'm starving, and this waitress is taking forever. Hey. - What? - You just banged her in the men's room, didn't you? They didn't have a gender neutral one. How're them wings? Kinda cold. Speaking of shots... Hey, thanks for not banging Tasha. Dude, first, I would never bang any chick you're even remotely interested in. And second, I would never, except the proposition from that skank. Every other guy in Toledo did. Plus I already banged pretty much the whole entire female population, so... Right... Goodbye to thin walls. The usual? Porn! 16-15. So how's it going? Some guys are getting hammered. Sad guy is a good tipper though. I'm gonna make him sadder then. Hey, is Jade still around? Yeah, she just banged his friend in the bathroom. - Ewe. - I know. I guess the Fosters never told their niece this is a family restaurant. Goodbye being roommates. Yeah, don't cry too much, honey, I'll see you at work. This transfer couldn't have come at a better time. God, two years! I tried. You did well by her. You can't polish a turd. Two years. I thought I was in love, I was just trying to bang her out of my system. Still? That smells like chocolate chick. Okay, shoot. I got this. Okay, Claire. Good luck. We never found her, did we, Big Guy? Are you talking at anyone in particular or do your shot glasses usually respond? Liz! Liz! Come here! Oh, my God! Come here! - It's him! - Him, who? It's him! Yeah, yeah. It's him. I wasn't asking! Oh, my God, I think I'm having a stroke! No, you're fine. Put this around your neck and write down what you want me to do. What? No! Take the order. Hi, boys! What are we drinking tonight? Tequila! Do a shot with us. You'll have to excuse my sad friend here, he's mourning the loss of a girlfriend and he's mad at me 'cause I made him come out rather than staying at home and watching Beaches and diddling his vagina. Shut up, dick fuck! Claire, get your sweet ass up here and take a shot with these lovely gentlemen! Liz, you know I can't drink while I work. Oh, shut your yap. You know the Fosters don't mind if you drink on the job. Let's make this a little more awkward. So what are we drinking to? Do your shot glasses talk to you ever? Huh, funny. Oh, God. Yes, this will do it. Now we're talking! Claire... Mommy... Mommy... - Mommy! - Holy shit! I never swear in front of him. Unless I have a hangover that feels like someone kicked me in the head and then shit in my mouth. You said a bad word, Mommy. Yeah... Mommy said a bad word sometimes. Sometimes mommies say bad words. Just don't ever repeat it, okay? I was gonna keep him out, but then... I didn't. Want me to beat up your friend, Mommy? What? Papa said your friends Johnny, Jack and Jose made you sick. Want me to go punch them in the nuts? No, no. Gavin, what are you...? What is he...? No. So, what happened? Huh? You never drink this much unless something happened. He came to the bar last night. Did you get his name this time? Ah, Jesus! Jesus Christ! Gavin! Front row! I love orientation. Hey, you think we're gonna watch that sexual harassment thing again? Remember? The old VHS had the handlebar mustache guy, and he's like, humping the tire, making that tubby dude cry? Please, shut up. Hope our new foreman isn't a douche bag. He's actually an okay guy. Transferred from Columbus last week. No kidding, we just got here ourselves. He knows that. We're at the orientation. Drew Parrot. This is Carter Ellis. He likes pointing out how intelligent he is after vomiting Yager Bombs. Jim Gilmore. What brought you here, Jim? FiancÃ©e. We met at the U of O, I think that it's the longest time and distance she's ever wanted to be away. Big town mouth, but small town girl, you know. Ah, good ole U of O. Wait, you guys both went? No! No, no, we crashed a fraternity party there, what, like, five years ago? Carter here bagged a virgin! At least keep your voice down. Of course he got so hammered, he never even remembered what she looked like or even what her name was. Other than what, she smelled like... What was it, Count Chocula, Cocoa Puffs? No, it was Count Chocula. Why do I still talk to you? Next morning I find him on the bed and he's smelling her pillow... Then out of nowhere, he just started screeching like a chicken, "My dick's bleeding, Drew, my dick's bleeding!" Of course, I'm Captain Hetero, so I'm like, "Well, whip it out. Dr. Drew'll inspect!" So, he does! 'Cause I was afraid! Well, I noticed a rubber ring around his dick, 'cause King Johnson here had busted through his jimmy while in action. So, I'm like, "Your dick's not bleeding, You probably just banged a virgin." Right. And he never got her name. Douche, right? I looked everywhere for this girl. I even bribed the secretary at admission to show me the photos of every single female student to find her. And yeah, she called the cops on me, but I tried, damn it! And no, I never really stopped thinking about her. Whatever, I'm a fucking loser. No, no. Hey, why don't both of you guys come over to my house for drinks tonight? Yeah? Meet my girl. I wanna hear more about this Cocoa Puff girl in detail. Creepy, man! I like it. We'll see. All right, it's about time here. Maybe avoid openly laughing at sexual harassment, hm? Where are you...? Oh, and Drew... Don't wear that to work again. All right, everyone, welcome. My name's Jim Gilmore, I'll be your foreman. Hey, Claire, does this peaches and cream have dairy in it? I can't have dairy, I'm vegan. Are you sure this massage oil burns cool? I'm a nurse and I work in the yard. I've seen people get those things stuck in places they should not get stuck. Wait, is penis considered meat? 'Cause the last time me and my boyfriend tried the hot oil, it burned his you-know-what. Am I still eating? I'm just here for the snacks. Okay, look! I have zero experience with any of this shit. Maybe Jenny here does, but I'm doing this as a favor for Liz. I have had exactly one and a half sexual partners in my life, and let me tell you, both experiences have been pretty shitty. I've never been with anything that required batteries or special cleaner instructions or weapon of mass destruction wording. The first thought that comes to my mind whenever I think about anything even remotely sexual is "consequence", so if you wanna make an order, I will be in the kitchen! And try the chocolate covered potato chips! They're really good. Yay... Okay... Do you wanna pass this around, "In-the-Ass Ingrid"? Great... You'll love it. Jenny, I'm so sorry. My God, honey, no, no! You just doubled our sales. What? Yeah, everybody felt so bad for you, they've decided that anything they buy themselves tonight they're gonna buy you one too. Isn't that awesome? So awesome. So... teeny-tiny... weeny suggestion: I personally think that you should pleasure yourself with the Jackrabbit and just re-gift the Gargantuan Girth Monster. Gotcha. Yeah, so, are you okay if I sneak that out of your gift bag at the end of the night? Yep, it's all yours. Cool. Thank you. 'Cause... my vagina can... pack a punch. Congratulations. Come on in! Forget everything I said I was scared of yesterday, now the whole town knows my vagina plays the violin. Claire... I lost my shit after the third question of where does the cock ring go and it gets stuck in the thing and... Jesus H. Christ, Liz! A woman who hasn't even gotten close to getting off with a man should not be selling sex toys. There's someone behind me, isn't there? Oh, look, alcohol. - So... Jenny. What an exotic name. - Yeah. Thank you. I used to spell it with two E's when I was an actress. And now you're a designer of provocative brochures and what-not? Not pacifically, no, but I do handle all of the graphic design, as well as the merchandise consultation. Oh, Liz, by the way, the new one gave me multiple orgasms on the way here. Wait, you mean specifically? That's what I said, pacifically. And did you mean "on the way here"? Yeah, yeah. I brought the Gargantuan for the drive over here because some of the stoplights in this town is like fo-re-ver! I hear ya! We should go hit the open road. You drive a stick? Oh, no, I drive a Prius. The whales... Okay, I should go home back to... my laundry. Yeah, it's done. You sure? There's not something you wanna say... to someone here? No... Well, enjoy your goody bag, Claire. And as I always say, "When the crazy train's fuming... get off." Thank you, Jenny. Carter, you wanna walk Claire to her car? Oh, no, no, that's more than fine. Hey, Liz, did you hear the timer go off in the oven? I think I heard the timer go off. No, I definitely don't hear a timer. No, no, the timer definitely went off, I think you can't hear it because you weren't paying attention. Hey, Liz? Subtlely is not a second language. Dude! Kitchen! How could you let me walk into that? Ever heard of a cell phone? They followed Jim home from the plant! His phone died. He updated me about 30 seconds before you you got here! He doesn't even remember who I am. Jim told me everything! He's been obsessing over you for the past five years like a blubbering orphan! Oh, my God, he has? He didn't have a picture. You live with his Mini-Me. Ladies? Sorry, but... I'm leaving now too if I can still walk Claire out? Laundry. - Hey, Claire? - Yes? Can I see you again? Oh, fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Call me. Liz can give you my number. Relaxation and confidence... What? Oh, yeah! Yeah... yeah! Holy shit balls! Hey, bitch! Were you singing? What are you doing? Gavin's at school so I thought I'd clean up a bit around here. Claire, you never clean. Am I losing you here? No! No, I'm... I'm good! You savage nympho... Excuse me? You sampled the goods! I don't know what you're talking about. Which one did you try? The Jackrabbit! Oh, my God, I feel amazing every time I think of it! Congratulations, Grasshopper. Well, thank you. So, what's up? Little problem. Something with the zoning commission. Oh. Wow. Yeah. They say that one shop can't have two breaker boxes. I don't even know what the hell a breaker box is. I don't know. It makes me sick even just thinking about this. I think we need... a man. Like an electrician man? Yeah. You know, I think someone on the city council is behind this. There was no problem until they set the date to vote us in or out. Whatever, does your dad know... electric stuff? He's a mechanic, but I'll ask. Okay, thanks. Unknown Caller Hello? Hey. It's Carter. Hi. Yeah, everybody goes... And for the next two weeks, night shifts and overtime made our schedules only allow communication by phone. As in we had to talk. It was perfect. The Boy From the Party... The Father of My Son... was finally becoming "Carter". Two brothers. Older. Used to convince me that Santa would skip our house unless I went to school with underoos on my head. Aw... Yeah, I think I did the Big Brother thing just to balance out the universe. And we had to bust out the back doors in the middle of winter, remind you... - She left when I was fifteen. - Rough. And I do see her every now and again, and she'll always post whatever picture she takes of us on her Facebook page and be, like, "Me and my BFF!" But I like to think that parents can teach you things accidentally. Like how to be a completely different mom someday? Someday. That was when he wanted kids. So, someday I'd let him know the one thing I was holding back. Along with who I was. And how he was the only guy I'd ever... I'd tell him. Someday. Or Saturday. Yeah, Saturday was good. The two are completely rewired as one now. Yeah. Dad, I can't believe I never knew you were a contractor. - I mean, I can... - Mr. Morgan, if you weren't her dad I would so hump your leg right now! That's a... It's a little weird, okay? Oh, shit, ice cream! - Gavin! - I got him. How is it even men of stone can get so squirmy? That's my dad, Liz. Ew. Gavin, get your ass back here! Whoa, there, Guy! Wait for Dad, huh? This yours? Daughter's. - You got kids? - Nope. Good answer. Okay, so make sure you get three of everything, okay? Okay, I'll call you when I'm headed to the... - Hey! - Hi. Hi, Carter. You didn't mention... Okay! Well, three's a threesome, so you kids have fun. She funny? I can't tell. It might be safer to let her believe it. This place looks great. And you... look great. Thanks. Smells like chocolate in here. What did you make? It's probably me. I always smell like chocolate. What's your favorite movie? My favorite movie? It's Heathers. It's you. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to. I wanted to, I just... didn't. So you knew it was me at the bar? - Yeah. - God, you probably thought - I was such an asshole. - No. How could you tell after five years? Mommy! I got some ice cream. Hi, honey. Who the hell are you? Gavin, mommy's with a customer. Logan. We'll be in the car. Yeah. That was a kid, right? Yeah. I lost my virginity to a really cool guy at a frat party a few years ago and got I got knocked up. With a kid. I thought we used a condom. I don't think it worked. - Holy... - Okay, Carter... Why didn't you tell me? Just take a breath, okay? His name is Gavin? Yeah. What? You disapprove? I kinda picked it myself, since the father was nowhere to be found. I scoured the Earth for you! Really? Because I never left Ohio. I dry heave whenever I see someone puke, all right? I... I don't know how to change a diaper. Okay, he's four years old. He doesn't wear diapers anymore and he's not Linda Blair from The Exorcist. Wait, who the... Look... Can I call you later, please? Sure. The next week of hearing nothing made me realize what I finally had to do: I would marry my Jackrabbit. As for what I would I really do? Go back to my day. Hoping Gavin would meet a friend who wouldn't tell their parents where they had learned "that word". Making penis and boob cookies. Telling myself Arnold and Keanu could raise a well-adjusted man. Watching women eat penis and boob cookies. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. Hey! Jesus! Soberman enter. Dropman late. All right, man, there's no need to act like a baby. All right, out with this. That's why I run to the store and buy my own tampons. She has a kid! I'm somebody's dad. Yeah, I got that from the voice mail you left me. Your kid. Jenny told me everything Oh, I banged Jenny. Tits are... What the hell am I gonna do? Look, I know you're in shock, but sitting around here fingering your vagina all day isn't gonna make anything better. You spent all these years trying to find her and now here she is. Right in front of you. So she's got a little baggage. Who doesn't? She has a baggage? Dude, she has a son. Your son. Wake up and look in the mirror, baby daddy. And you spent all these years trying to bang her out of your system with some chick you could barely stand. In the words of the great Maury Povich, "You are the father." Go talk to her. Did he answer back? Good for you. Hey, Denny, let me get that. Hey, Sarah, I saw your sister yesterday. She... Did it! Par, ladies and gentlemen! You saw it, right? Here! What can I do for you? I'm sorry. It's okay. No, I'm sorry. Can we talk? I'm kind of in a double today. Well, can I stay? I mean, why go home when I can sit here and stare at a hot chick all night? Well, you're out of luck, 'cause it's only me here tonight. Well... then I guess it's a good thing that you're the hottest and sexiest woman I've ever seen. What time do you get off? Not until one. Can I wait here until you're done working? I can help you close up and, you know, we can talk, or whatever. Yeah... whatever. Directed! Point for me! Right on the noggin. Point for Carter, baby, put it on the board. I have a giant head, it's not that hard. Put it on the board, game over. Gotta make that shot! It was wide open! Oh, Denny, hold on. Okay. I'm gonna get him a car, all right? Here, let's go, bud. Thanks. Okay, last call and the soda keg is tapped. Oh, no, lemme help you close, you look exhausted. Is it a nice way of saying I look like shit? I would tell you if you looked like shit. I would tell you if the jeans you're wearing made your ass look fat. I would tell you if the meal you cooked me tasted like something I'd stepped in. And... and... I would tell you if a joke you told me was as unfunny as a battered puppy. Well, let me buy an honest man a drink then. I'm good. I promise. I should've just told you. I'm... I should've just woken you up that morning. So, what do you wanna talk about? To know what it's like. To be a parent. Gavin is wonderful. He is smart and funny and he's the best little boy in the world. He has his moments though. But, yeah, he's well behaved and he's perfect. Just perfect. It's okay if you wanna complain. I mean, I can only imagine how tough it's been. I love, Gavin. Hey, no one's questioning that. I love Gavin to death, but he drives me fucking crazy. I mean, the firs time he said mommy, oh, my God, my heart melted, but that kid won't shut up... ever. Did you know I gained 56 pounds when I was pregnant with him. My ass had its own zip code. Well, if it makes you feel better, you have an awesome ass. Thank you. Being a parent is saving someone's life every five minutes. It's knowing that you could ruin the future of the one person you love the most whether you're trying your damn hardest or not. It's also wiping away every single problem you've ever had for a few minutes or seconds and... when they run up to you and they give you a big hug. And it's lonely. You kind of amaze me, you know that? I can't believe you don't hate me right now. Wait, why would I hate you? Because I used you for sex and I never spoke to you again. Where I come from, that's Christmas morning to a guy. And I... I should be the one apologizing to you. I gotta go... If I would've ever known that you... that you would never... that I was your first... I would've done things a hell of a lot differently. Like what? I would've kissed you more. I would've held your body against mine longer so I could feel every... inch of you. I would've touched you everywhere. Everywhere. And take the time to feel your heartbeat in my hand. Touch my vagina. Being close to you... Being close to you just drives me so crazy. If you think this is too much too fast, just tell me to stop and I will. If you stop... I'll straight up murder your ass. I know this doesn't make up for the other night. But I wanna make you feel good, Claire. Can I touch you? I need your fingers inside of me. That's the hottest thing I've ever heard. Oh, God, I said that out loud, didn't I? I forget how bad you are... Oh, Lord! Fuck, Carter. My God! I have a really important question to ask you. I want to spend some time with Gavin. - Okay. - It's okay if you're not comfortable... No, no. I would love you to meet him. It's just... For you to do that, you're gonna have to meet... him. Him... who? Yeah... If you touch my daughter's boobs while I'm standing here, I'm gonna stuff taffee in your trachea tube and terminate you. Did your dad just tell me he's gonna choke me to death with taffee? Yeah, he's on the letter T. You got any tattoos, son? No, no, sir, I don't. You own a bike? Well, I have a mountain bike that's in storage, I don't really... A motorcycle, Kathy, a motorcycle. Dad... No, and my name's Carter, by the way. Ever been locked up? Had trouble with the law? No, sir... never. Have you ever made a man bleed so bad that before you finished beating him you thought, "Maybe I've gone too far."? No. You sure he's not gay? - He's not gay! - Yeah, no. All right, Carter's here to spend time with Gavin and I 'cause that's what he should be doing, right? Fine. But you knock her up again and you somehow disappear... Dad! I'll come to the edges of the Earth, hunt you down and deliver her cranky ass to your doorstep. I'm not dealing with nine more months of this pussy pants over here. Yeah... yeah, deal. Team Jacob, bitch! Gavin! My new sword I found jiggles! - I'm out. - What does this button do? Mommy, this tickles... Where did you get this? And why did you do that to Carter? You know better! You said that he was your friend. He is. He is Mommy's friend! Papa said your friends whooped your ass... Oh, honey. He's not Johnny, Jack or Jose... Good job, bud. Protect, mommy. Can you...? Hey... Hi. There you go. That was good hit. I need you. Well, now it's kind of not a good time. The shipment came a day early and they left all the merch outside in the open... and some do-gooder dickhead must have signed for it... - What? - They lifted one of the Dildo Dans. Okay, okay, take a deep breath in and I'll see what I can do. God, what is wrong with people? Yeah, I know. Bye. Carter's tall. Gavin's observant. We have to reschedule this. Why? What's up? Hey, honey. Why won't you leave this stuff in your room, please? Thank you. So Liz and I need to get something off the street before the wrong people tell the wrong people. And my dad works tonight, so... Something inappropriate that he would see if you brought him? - Oh... - It's cool, I've got him. - I don't wanna... - I know. After I found out, I left the scene like a hit and run driver, but I promise you, Claire, I will never get spooked again. Did you just quote Cocktail to me? Yes. Yes, I did. Okay, you can watch him. Boys night! There we go! Right in the stock room. Fuck, that's hot! I'd let him sell my kid for that. Aren't you the big, bold hussy now! Not really. Claire, are you already self-sabotaging this? Claire. Did you cyber-stalk him? Well, he gave me his last name! Is his ex is hot? Look at this bitch! God! Oh, God, I hate her! Right? Holy slut-shame, Batman! You know what? You've heard it. She's a shitty creature in a hottie shell. She's sex personified. How's he not gonna be thinking about her when I don't know how to... sex? - What? - I mean, sexy. I don't' know how to... "sexy". Claire! You're hot. Again, you could just stand there and he would wanna hump your leg. Okay... Repeat after me. "I'm a dirty, dirty slut." Okay, you are really starting to piss me off. Do you think I'd let you be my best friend if I didn't think that there was a dirty little whore working in there somewhere? Okay. I'm a dirty, dirty slut. Okay, she's dirty girl. You can do better. Really, put your vagina into it. Okay... I'm a dirty, dirty slut. Yes. - All right. - Think like that when you talk to him and you'll make his dick stand straight up. Oh, my God. Okay, I'm a dirty, dirty slut! Yes, you are! Dirty... Ouch, slut. How can we help you today? Did somebody fart? Why would you ask me that? 'Cause of your face. My face offends you, does it? We're not open publicly yet. Yet the door is wide open for any unsuspecting citizen to just wander in and be faced with... what-have-you. We'll be sure to lock it behind you. You might watch your tone with me there, dear. We both know this was more than open to the public today. BUTLER CITY COUNCIL What can I do for you today, Lorraine? You mean to sell sexual products on one side and sweets on the other, correct? Yes, Ma'am. Do you plan to build a barrier in between? Children tend to enjoy candy shops. Yes, Ma'am, there will be a visible separation with a curtain and an "adults only" sign. We'll have the candles and lingerie on the floor and then everything else will be in the back. So you'll pick out what you want on the brochure or order online before your visit. My visit? No. Oh, it'll be gift-bagged. It's all in the proposal. I'm sure you've read it. I'm sure I have. "Butler needs a naughty little secret." That's what we believe. I believe that Butler has been a fine place to live since 1835. And I have a secret for you ladies: the council has to be unanimous when approving a new business. And I intend to keep these doors locked shut. Good day. Who the fuck says "Good Day?" Good day, sir. What's the panic? Why aren't you wearing a shirt? Didn't know if he reads yet. No, I lost him, Drew. I lost him! What? - The last time you saw him? - Was nap time. - I tucked him in. - Where? - Where what? - Where what? His bedroom, the roof? Focus man, I'm trying to find a missing child, damn it! I know you're... God, why did I even call you? Because you're freaking out! Now, man up here and point! Dude! Unmade bed. So, he's either a slob or planned on coming back. When's the last he ate, what'd he have? Snack was Cheetos and juice around 3. I'm calling the police. Touch that phone, she finds out. Gimme five, we find him. I'm not lying to Claire! Exactly. A lie would be you lost him. But you thought you did, and like Superdad you called Detective Drew. He was never gone. Cheetos... And where were you at T.O.D.? What's "Tod"? Time of disappearance, come on! We were watching TV on the couch. So, he'd have had to pass you to get to the door. You need to watch more Scooby-Doo. Who's gonna wipe me? - Hey. - Hey. How'd it go? Good... good. He kinda let himself in when I was peeing and I turned away too quickly, and... I cleaned it up. That's okay. I'm home for the night, so you're off the clock. I wish I didn't have to work tonight. Yeah... me too. Hey... would you wanna come over Friday for dinner and stay the night? Both of you? Yeah. Okay, so... - I'll... - Carter has a big penis. Good to know, buddy... 'cause it's been a while. - Okay. I'll see you. - Yeah. - Good. - You will. Night, bud. Small size, huh? Very funny. On your period? Listen, man. Since I just caught you buying condoms and Claire's like a sister to me, I feel like I'm gonna say a few words at this time. You know, I would never want you to feel like your job is ever in danger if... Look, man. I get it. You gotta say some words. Break her heart, and I'll skull-fuck you. That came out wrong. Damm it, it sounded good in the movie. It's okay, I would never want that to happen. Either thing. What does "skull-fuck" even mean anyway? I think it's when you rip a guy's eyeball out of its socket and then put your dick in there. Then I guess you... Fuck his brains? I guess "skull-fuck" had a better ring to it. Why would you do that to anyone? I don't know, Jim, I'm just shopping. Just treat her right, okay? Got it. Hey, Jim? I think I love her. And I just wanna make her happy. Well, no one can skull-fuck you for trying. Hey, guys! Hello, Farter. Carter. Sexy. Sexy. Sexual thoughts. Come on in! Cum on my face, I'm a dirty slut. Veggie lasagna cool? That's great. Just shove it in my pussy. Hey, Gav, come here. I got this crazy thing I gotta show you. What the fuck? Gavin! Suck my ass and call me Steven... Holy shit! Don't say that! Now the crazy part is it's a magic room. So, every time you say a naughty word, a toy disappears. Yeah. Now, just make sure it's okay with mom to go in. Please, Mommy, I'll say all the good words. Okay, go have fun. And remember, it's almost bedtime. Okay. Hang a right and drop me off in Dicktown. He likes it. More wine? More hard cock in my mouth? Oh, no, thanks. Are you feeling okay? Fucktastic. Penises may be players, but vaginas are the dealers in this town. You're not gonna win against the house, bitch. I'm trying to be sexy. What? Jesus, your ex is like the queen of plow-me selfies. Tasha? You mean that stupid five-year-old fish face she did? Dude, I know I'm an idiot. By the way, this lasagna tastes amazing, you have to give me the recipe. Oh, my God. Okay, okay, stop. Just start over with me. Yeah, right. How 'bout them Mud Hens? Team's not looking bad this year. Does Gavin like baseball? Actually, yeah. He's been asking when you're gonna play catch with him again. We should check out a game. We would love that. I hope I didn't overdo with the bedroom, I just... I got to the toy store, and... I don't know, there's this garbage truck named Stinky. It sorta just picks up bits of garbage and then burps. I don't know, I guess I kinda just half bought it for myself. What? You just amaze me, that's all. Are you done? Yeah. And before we do this... I need you to know something. I am 100%, absolutely in love with you. And Gavin. I love you too, Carter. Wait, wait. What, you want me to stop? I'm not as perfect as you think. I had a kid, you know, it's a thing. Okay. Well, fuck it! Just being close to you drives me crazy. I have a quivering loin. You don't have to try to be sexy or dirty. Just you breathing does it. You're everything I've ever wanted, Claire. Don't ever doubt that. It feels so good. More. Mommy? What are you guys doing? Mommy's on a very important phone call. Long distance. I don't feel good. Okay, gimme a minute. And I'll be right back. I need you to give me a minute. Shouldn't we maybe be on call? I mean, we can do this another night. Fuck, no! You're not off the hook. No! What's wrong? Carter? The bugs got lotion when the dogs tickled... Farmer. Oh, don't eat the marker, Drew... Why... 'Cause I never see you anymore! Yeah! You see me every week! For work! This is work too though, we gotta get these things together if we're gonna send 'em out to everyone on the mailing list before the opening! 'Cause we only have a week left here. Don't you think we should wait and see what happens with the city before we do anything? Claire! Think positive and drink with us! Hey, go have fun. I don't wanna... I don't wanna be the new guy that hides you from your friends. We're good here. Good as fu... "ugdecicles". Good save, bud. Okay, but I'm only gonna have one glass of wine. Holy balls, I love wine! I love wine more than a hooker loves free VD testing day at the clinic. Sol just seems like a very sad day. Oh, no! Oh, no, shit, wait. No... shit. - Did you forget to lock the door? - No. Oh, no, because... "Hello... My name is Lorraine. Here's my card. And I plan to keep this door locked... just like my dry vagina... Because I'm a miserable potato-head who looks like I'm constantly breathing in a pile of shit." You should seriously do stand-up! Hey, what about me? Oh, I don't think that you're very funny. - Bitch. - You know what? I'm gonna do stand-up when we stand up to her and we turn this place into a motherfucking goldmine. Yeah! - 'Cause guess what? - What? - Guess what. - What? Nobody can stop us now, bitches! My... Who put alcohol in my alcohol? Yeah. Look, I'd rather get this out now before you think something's wrong later... Is this an intervention? No, no. But I am calling you a shitty drunk. So am I. I mean, we actually made a child together. But you did something last night, that got me to think. Oh, God, what did I do? More like... what you wrote. Lucky for you I am fluent in Claire's drunk ramblings This is your last will and testament in case you died... from a staple. This is so embarrassing. No, no. I can tell that this is important to you. And it's important to me too. And I know you have your dad and my parents are very old, but... No, I agree. I think we should have someone younger as a back-up plan. Well, Liz and Jim. Yeah, I love Liz. Well, I like her enough. And Jim too, but do we know much about them and kids? Well, they are looking after her sister's kid today. So maybe we could go spy on them while Liz and I finish paperwork. Sounds like a mission. Hey, bud! No, no! You guys suck! She said "suck". I know, I heard it. Come on, Mommy! Come on, Mommy! God, I wish my sister would eat her young. Melissa! Auntie Liz told you no to run. Whatever, maybe she'll hit her head and fall asleep. That's all you're gonna do? No. The next time she runs through here, I'm gonna kick her. Trip her. Still family. Hey, is she in here? Melissa, careful! Remember when we both forgot her at Bob Evans' and drove away? Yeah! That's my favorite memory with her. Fuck! Oh, fuck! Fuck me as in fuck me in the... Hey! Mommy? Melissa's telling me to touch her no-no zone. What does that mean? I don't like her. Mom's a little busy, bud. What happened? Liz, you are not helping my post-drunk anxiety. I did something last night. What? Oh, God, please tell me this is a nightmare... This isn't a nightmare. What happened? I called Lorraine using the card that she gave me and left a very unfortunate voicemail. What did you say? I said something like, I'm going to tell the FBI that she signed for the merch! And then I may or may not have called a C-U-Next-Tuesday! No! Liz, we were gonna show her the shop together! I know, but I was drunk! And it got me all riled up with your fucking comedy show! So now it's my fault? Let me see her message. Oh, God! Oh, God, now there's no chance for us at all, is there? She's gonna vote us down and pursue a harassment case. God dammit, Liz. I trusted you. Hey, I gave this to you. Well, it's always the same story with you. The Liz giveth and The Liz taketh away. Oh, well, maybe The Liz should stop helping since all I ever do is fuck things up for you, right? That's not fair. Five years, you had. To hire a PI to find your baby daddy or find another way to get your degree. But only when the world comes to you do you go on with life! You know what, Liz, not all of us have our granddaddy's money to set us up for life! Fuck you! I'm sorry, Liz. I didn't mean. I didn't wanna say... Claire, grow up! Just do it the hell away from me! I don't think Liz and Jim should... Me neither! Hey... I was thinking maybe you guys should move in with me. I mean, you guys are there most of the time anyway now, and... I was thinking I could pitch in, you know, for him... you. Until you guys figure this out. You wanna rescue me? I wanna try. Like a prince? In those movies you're showing him? What, Disney? I wanna broaden his horizon beyond Die Hard and Fight Club. At least John McClane did something to get the girl! Little Mermaid had to what, quit her friends and family for fucking feet? Whoa, whoa... How come Eric never grew gills, huh? How come Belle went from wanting a better life to Stockholm Syndrome? Claire, look at me. I'm not a cartoon. I just... I wanna be my kid's dad. Okay, and I also wanna be the guy that you complain to when you come home after work... I do not complain. - Yes, you do. - Not before you showed up! Not before everybody else forgot that I can do this on my own. Porn? I miss us School of Business Applicant Hey! Hey, bitch. Liz, I'm... Sorry. Me first. How are you doing? I'm a student. Cool... And I'm a graduate who should've majored in pole dancing. Wow, okay, that joke just fell flat, huh? There was a joke in there? I missed it. Fuck you, whore. Are you working tonight? I'm home with Gavin. Dad has plans tonight and he never has plans, so... My mom, too. Must be some new old people Bingo club thing. Maybe Lorraine will be there! Should ask your dad if he's a hitman. You know, we can speak before they vote. Maybe we should just go down there and talk to them. Yeah, no, I'm thinking that maybe me speaking would definitely do more harm than good. But you know what? It is still our space and we can just do what we planned. It just would've been fun, you know? Yeah, I know. Hell with it. Was just a business. I love you. I love you, too. - There you go. - So strong. Hey, Dad, I'm going out. Do you need anything? No one's ever asked me that before. No, I'm good. Okay. Hey, Dad! Thank you. For everything. For taking me back in. For helping me raise my child. That's my job, kiddo. Yeah, but I feel like I never thanked you for that. And I don't want you to think that I take you for granted or that I don't appreciate you and everything you do for us... No, no, hey, hey... No, no... No. Come on... You're gonna be okay. Yeah. Okay, yeah... Claire... Listen, if there's... one thing I learned from your mom... and I do mean one thing... is that love is not like it is in the movies. Thanks, Dad. - That was... general. - No, it's... It's not like it is in the movies in that... You don't... get to be with who you wanna me with. It's not always about war or... The Matrix or that someone's a werewolf, you know. It's about what you want. Thank you, Dad. Get out. I'd planned on respecting your space, then your dad called me and said "stop messaging my daughter"... with emojis. Then he told me you're here. So... Yeah... I am. I'm so sorry. Are those chocolate penises and boobs? Yeah. They're... party favors... Party I have tonight. Oh, shit! Did you get chocolate in my hair? Yeah, you can get chocolate wherever you want. I love you more than chocolate. Now it's my turn to play. Oh, shit! Oh, sweet Jesus! It looks like a chocolate bomb went off in here. I think I'm gonna like this chocolate business. Yeah. By the way, we're moving in with you. What is all this for? Are you guys not getting voted down? I gotta make more chocolate. Can I help you? Yeah. All right. Let's get this done. Hello? What did you do? Claire, what did you do? I... I thought I... I thought I would help out... My lawyer was at the council meeting and just called, tell me, what the hell did you do? What the hell is this woman's problem? A problem? Claire, she voted us in! She told everyone to spread the news and we're gonna open! We're opening this weekend! What the fuck did you tell her? Okay, anyways, I gotta go! Okay, bye, girl! I'll see you later, okay? Bye. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you. Hi, sweetie! Hi, Mom! What are you up to? I got that. Mr. Morgan! You're banging my mom. Bingo, okay! Excuse me. I'm just... I'm just gonna throw up a little bit. Okay... Whoa, Simba! Save it for Billy's tomorrow, bud. Here, let's go get a camel apple. "Camel." You know, I told Claire that it was you. Who got me to man up. And she notices how you change your shirts for Gavin. So, as strange as it is... You're gonna let me borrow Claire? Borrow Cla... No, you dick! Good, I don't need that kinda temptation right now. God, you really are an asshole! I'm trying to ask you to be my son's godfather! Really? You're a good friend, Drew. So, if anything were to happen... Are you crying? No! You probably think I'm some kinda... Aw, fuck your butt! I love you too, man. Shut up! What did you put on her platter? The usual. Baked apples, cake pops, Major McGillicutty's Crispy Goodness Globs... chocolate covered potato chips and... a Jackrabbit. Claire! So, Gavin. You will always have a room at papa's house, but we're gonna move in with Carter now. Because he's your dad. And we're a family. My dad for real? Yeah. So, one day my weiner will be as big as yours? I believe, bud. Hey, you may end up bigger. - Holy shit! - Gavin!
