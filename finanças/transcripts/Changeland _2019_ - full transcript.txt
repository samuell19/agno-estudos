Uh-- I mean, I should have known, right? They had such good chemistry onstage. Okay. Then the question you gotta answer is, do you wanna fight for it or not? - That's really oversimplifying it. - No, it's not. Everything's on either side of that question. You wanna fight for it or not? You answer that, everything follows. - Maybe later on, okay, bye. - No thank you. - Welcome to The Slate. - Oh, thank you. Welcome. Nice. Hello, welcome to The Slate, Phuket. - You are checking in? - Ah, yes. It should be under, uh, Brandon Matthews. Just a moment, sir. Ah, here it is. Ooh, our honeymoon suite for the happy couple.

We have prepared a lovely table for you. Suchin, did you close the place for us? Now is rainy season, so not many guests. Well, this is perfect, thank you. Tonight will be a special dinner just for you. Oh, you didn't need to make a fuss. Oh, we should have worn our matching shirts. Ah, this is your waiter, okay? I leave you now. Thank you, wait-- uh, Suchin. How do you say thank you in Thai? If you're a man, you would say, A woman would say, Wonderful. Have a good night. Thank you. - Drink? - Ah, yes, uh, two shots of whisky and do you have Chang in a bottle? Perfect. Oh, I-- I don't wanna drink. - Yeah, you do. - I do? Yeah, you remember on the plane you were telling me, you were like, "Dan, I'm sleeping, but listen to me carefully. Make sure I drink a whole lot, like a weird amount." - So. - That sounds just like me. Yeah, you sound a lot like that. It's funny, you don't hear it, but when I hear it, "Dan, Dan," - it's how you sound. - Hmh. Thank you. Buddy, we're gonna get you through it. Thanks. So, what happened? You saw an email? Um, yeah, several. She hid him under her best friend's name so that when... ...they texted I would think it was her. That's some sneaky shit. What did she say when you caught her? No, she doesn't know I know. What are you talking about. This was gonna be a surprise. And then I saw the-- You just left? - Vanessa doesn't know about the trip or anything? - No, I never told her. And then I-- I couldn't confront her, so... You skipped town without a word on your anniversary? I guess so. That's pretty badass. It doesn't feel it. Honestly, let her spin. And let's burn this guy's house down. Hmm. - No, I don't think that's the answer. - No? Then what is the answer? I don't wanna get divorced. Oh, Brandon. I'm not gonna kill your wife for you. Are you sure? 'Cause that would-- that would solve a lot. No, I can't. Not for free. Ah, sorry honey, I'm gonna be later. Uh, it's just running long. Don't wait up.

Okay, here we are at historic James Bond Island, everybody, back on the boat in one hour. - How would I fight for this? - What do you mean? Well, you asked me if I wanna fight for it or not. I'm asking, how would I go about fighting for it? What do you like about Vanessa? - What's that supposed to mean? - No, I'm not being confrontational. I promise. You're asking me how you fight for it, so I'm asking you, what are you fighting for? Wha-- I don't understand. Remember when you said you wanted to marry her? You said it was 'cause mostly she checked the right boxes. That's not love. You just, you never liked her. I don't like how she treats you. How you let her treat you. Or me. What are you talking about? Why didn't you invite me to Orphan Christmas last year? - Weren't you out of town? - No, I was in town for 16 hours. You just never called me back. - But, didn't Vanessa call you? - Yeah, she called. I told her I could come by, I had presents for you guys. She told me I could mail them. The dinner was just for family. Oh, well that's, you-- you know, just because her f-- her folks were there. I'm your family, B. You're my family. You called, I came. I always show up.

If I can say, you're coming across a little aggressive. And I understand that's kind of my fault, I dress like this, but you know, if you wanna get to know the real me, I don't know, give it a shot, you know, just say the word. Not today. No, not today. I'll see you tomorrow. - Bye, Dan. - Bye, Pen. If-non, if-non. Aren't you supposed to fight for it? I mean, that's what our parents did. You gotta make your own choices. It's-- It's Vanessa again. Yeah? Should I answer it? You've gone 48 hours with zero contact? More. Are you sure she wants to be forgiven? Maybe she wanted to get caught. Come on, let's take a walk. Okay, here's the thought. Ditch our old life, buy a bar, retire down here. We'll live out that buddy cop fantasy. Well, it has been a very tough career, keeping these streets clean. That's what I'm sayin', the commissioner's breathing down our necks and no offense to you or me, but we're gettin' ...too old for this shit. - Okay, or plan B. - Yeah. You move back home with your parents, - they'd love that. - Eh. I don't-- I don't think that's what I want. I agree, it's a good idea. No utilities, no rent, no mortgage. You get scared at night, you can run and sleep - between Chris and Nancy. - Yeah, you're really sellin' it. I'm tellin' you, with your dad, you'd double your wardrobe. Nancy can cook a mean dinner, it's perfect. Oh, we're goin' in. Take your shoes off. Kneel down. Put your hands together and bow three times. One for Buddha, one for his teachings and one for this monk. Now give him your right wrist. Now put your hands together and bow your head. Now bow three more times. - Cars. We got time? OK. - No, we're fine. We got time. My friends, leaving us so soon, eh? Suchin, yeah, we gotta catch a boat to another island. Thank you for everything. Yes, my pleasure. We are never gonna forget you. And I will never forget your love. - How cool is this shit! - I mean it looks a little-- - Don't say dangerous. - There's no roof. Come on!

Look, all my buddies back in Hill City, they-- they would join the military 'cause that's how you find a career. You know, they-- they would just kind of settle in to these lives that just I wanted no part of. And so I just decided to just find a life that suited me much better. - And so, I was like uh-huh. - Hmm. Wow. Don't you miss your life?

I think you're confusing racist with race-related. Hi, Dory. Looks like we're getting our date after all. We're just co-existing in public. Raj and Mali are here too. Are you on a date with them too?

But I love that you were gonna surprise her with this trip. Bet you're the plan ahead type. Um, yes, I prefer well thought out plans. This one just didn't work. - Well, none of my plans have ever worked. - No? My parents have run the boat tours for... ever. And always told me I'd take over. But I was like, no way. I wanted to act. - You did? - Yeah. When I was 15, I ran away to L.A. My aunt lived in Long Beach so I moved in with her. - That's crazy. - Yeah. You know, and it was good. I got to go to school. Yeah, but there's just so much competition, I didn't know anyone. I never really got to act, you know. Like I came all this way and never actually got to do it. - I'm sorry. - When I got back, I had this whole Dorothy moment. I realized I had everything I really wanted. Isn't that corny? - What do you mean? - Well, I love performing, making people happy. No matter who you are or where you're from, I give you a great tour. That's my stage. I make you laugh and have fun. I teach you about our beautiful culture and I make you respect it. You get to escape your normal life and come to my world. Even if you fight it, I'll get you. Well, you sure got me. Oh, did I now? Except I'll never trust you because of all these lies. I can't stop thinking about your Hasselblad. Oh, yeah? I took you as more of an Instamatic guy. Well, I can point and shoot, but that Hassie, that takes an eye. Luckily I have two of them. Oh, I noticed your eyes. - You are just-- - So, who are you into, Annie Leibovitz? Actually I prefer Cindy Sherman. Did not expect that. So you're in it for the culture. I'm in it for the capture. You're a hunter? Yeah, that moment, you know? That moment when something real happens. A smile, a feeling, nature. I see it, I catch it. Make other people feel it. I'm addicted to it. Me too. So you're really a photographer? I am. Professional. What do you shoot with? Well, my go-to is the Mamiya, but my favorite is my Linhof. You tryin' to tell me you shoot film. Lady, I shoot 8x10. You fight me. What? You fight me. I have to go to the bathroom. We fight, I kill you. N-- no, thanks. So you up and moved from California to Thailand. Mm-hm. Your family didn't freak out? My parents are dead. - You seem okay with that. - I didn't do it. Zipline mishap. - Stop. - I'm serious. Total freak accident on their vacation in New Zealand. Worst freshman year ever. Except that I met Pen. What, you fuckin' with me? Nope, it's hilarious. - Can I laugh? - I do, all the time. And you don't get sad? Oh, I got plenty of sad. But it wasn't my fault. I'm not gonna carry it. And they wouldn't want me too. My mom killed herself. - Dan, Dan! - B! You're not gonna believe it. Dory's a member of the dead parent's club. - It's true. - What? Dory's parents are both dead. Dan's got no parents. It's so weird you're both smiling when you say that. - He's got two parents. - Aw. I'm gonna go find Pen. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. I mean... Buddy, what's wrong? Some-- Somebody just tried to pick a fight with me. What are you talkin' about, who? Just this-- this-- this Thai guy. That narrows it down. Where is he, show me? Oh, there, there he is. - That guy? - Yeah, that guy right there. B, he's employed here. Yeah, they work for tips. It's like wrestling. It's like fake. It's not real. You don't-- you don't know that. He was serious. Yeah, serious like, "You're a tourist and I want you to drink a lot and get drunk and then I'm gonna kick your ass, yeah." He wouldn't kick my ass. Buddy. We're grownups. That guy's like 20 and kicks tourist ass all day. Come on, look, we need to focus on drinking these buckets and enjoying our last night on the island, okay? Come on, if-non, if-non. Last night. - Gonna borrow your buddy for a second. - Ooh-- Yeah, what can I get ya? One bucket, please. You're here to solve something. I can tell. You can? - Goongala. - Goongala. - Who are you? - I'm Martin. Yeah, I mean, what are you-- What are you doing here? Well, this beautiful island is between Myanmar and Hong Kong and I figured, be silly not to stop on the way. - You came from Myanmar? - I did. And I brought half these people with me. Wanna go to Hong Kong? Plenty of room in the boat. You-- You have a boat? Technically it's a yacht. Who are you? Brandon, take a look around this place. All these people from different worlds, all together. Every one of them wanting the same things. To feel safe. To feel love. To be understood. We all share that. B! Ian gave us a little surprise. - Uh-huh... - Come on. Oh, I remember this. - Yeah? - Yeah. It's been a while. When was the last time? When things started going bad with Vanessa. We just stopped having sex. It just got so awkward. So you guys got high. I thought it would loosen us up. Make her like me again. But it didn't work. Fuck that, you're awesome. Except I wasn't. What do you mean? I wasn't awesome, but I wanna be. Hey. I'm sorry. Don't mention it. Hey! You still want to fight? - I kill you. - Perfect. - You don't have to do this. - Oh, it's pro wrestling, right? Yeah. - Hey, thanks for doing this. - Yeah. - Fight! - Oh shit. Go, yeah, fight! - Get out of the corner, Brandon. - You can do it! - Fight. - Yeah, yeah, yeah! Just look at that! There you go! Keep moving! Fight, fight! All right, okay. Whoa, okay, okay, okay. The main thing is, you're just letting him hit you. Okay, you want to avoid that as much as possible. Okay, 'cause he's hitting you really hard and there's only so much you can take before you actually die, all right? So main takeaway? - Don't get hit. - Okay. Hey, are we fighting, like for real? - I kill you. - Oh shit. Fight. Punch! - Come on! - Yeah! Yeah, there you go! Yeah, get him, get him, get him. - There you go! - Yes, keep doing that! - Flurry! - Yes! Keep doing that! - Get up. - Come on buddy, get up! Atta boy! Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You gotta brush it off. - There we go. - Come on, throw it up. - You got this! - Okay. - Oh my god. All right, keep your hands up. Oh. - OK. - Stop. That's it, all right. OK. Main thing you're doing here, you're telegraphing your moves, okay. I'm pretty sure you said punch right before you punched. Now he heard that so he blocked it. You dig? OK, so now, don't let him know what you're doing, don't look we're you're gonna punch, just punch, okay? Fight! Yes, keep doing that! Yeah! Get up! - Fight. - Oh, stop. Okay, all right, stay down pal. Okay. - First, two... - You can go faster. - ...three, four, five... - Count by twos. - ...six, seven... - He's out. - You can stop. - ...eight, nine, ten. Okay, you did great. - Yeah, I did well? - Yeah, you did. Yeah, that was awesome. - Come on. There you go. - The winner! You did it though. Yeah, there we go. Yeah! All right! You wouldn't-- You wouldn't say I-- I got my ass kicked, right? Oh, not too you. Yeah. Yeah, we are brother! - Yeah, brother! - Yeah! Ah, we are brother! I mean, except that like everything hurts.
