- I've gotta go, honey. - Do you have to? - I have to get up and shave and shower. It's getting late. - Oh gee. - Come on now. You be a good girl Meg. - Why can't you stay? I miss you already. - That's good. I want you to miss me. What would you like to do tonight? Would you like to go dancing? Sounds nice. You get spiffed up in your prettiest dress. I'll be home early and we'll have dinner and then go to that calypso bar you like so much. I still can't see why you have to go to the office today. It's Saturday. Nobody works on Saturday. I'm sorry, honey. But Ed's in town for the day only and I must see him before he leaves. I'm sure that if you had really wanted to you could have worked things out so that you could spend the day with me. It was impossible. Now stop nagging. I'll just have time for coffee. - For heaven sake, sit down and eat properly. - Look, don't be angry. - You're impossible. - Now, be reasonable. I'll get home early. Goodbye. - Why can't you speak to ed on the phone? - Meg, please don't nag. Now, let me see you smile. There, that's my girl. See you later. - Stop, stop or I'll scream. You wouldn't be so foolish. - I hear someone coming, get up. Get up! You'd better not say anything to anyone about this. - Come to my apartment or I'll tell your husband what happened. - Look, here, some money. I'll get you more. - I don't want your money. - No, no. No, no. No, no. Please, please stop. - See, you came here to live. I thought about you all the time. - No, no. No, no. If my husband finds out. - If you don't tell him, he'll never find out. But I will tell my husband. - You won't tell him, you're too smart. - No. Oh my god. What have I done? Oh, I can't believe it. What did I do? If Ted had stayed home today, this wouldn't have happened. No one will believe that I didn't go to that... That man's apartment willingly. Ugh. - If only I hadn't destroyed the note that he put under the door. What can I do? I'd better go away but where? Where can I go? Poor Ted. I'll go to New York. I can get lost in the crowds there. - What's the matter kid? Nothing. - If nothing's a matter, what are you crying about? You in some kind of trouble? - No. - You're sure you're not in some kind of trouble? - No, I'm not. - Do you have any place to go? - No. No, place. - Do you have any money? No place to go and no money to go there with. That's pretty rough kid. Come on. I take it you are from out of town. - Yes I am. - Were you ever in New York before? No, never. - Well, it's a pretty big place, but to me, it's home. I had a job in Reno for about three months last year. It's an exciting town, but doesn't compare to New York as far as I'm concerned. I just couldn't wait to get back to the big city. Where you from? - Chicago. - What's your name? - Ellen, Ellen green. - Well, this is home. - It's very nice. - Are you hungry? - No. - You sure you don't want something to eat? - No. - You can sleep on the couch. It's pretty comfortable. I'll take the bedroom. You can put your things in that closet. - Thank you. - I'm ai banes, I have a night job. I sleep during the day. I'm gonna turn in now. Relax kid. You don't have a thing to worry about. Smells good. I'm gonna miss your cooking when you're gone. No kidding. Cut it. Come on, relax. I'm sorry, kid. - That's all right. - You're a funny one. So quiet. What are you thinking about? - I'm thinking how kind you are. You're really the kindest man I've known. - Ah, come on. I mean it. I feel like having a drink some nice scotch and soda or - I have no liquor here. If you wanna drink, go to a bar. Ellen. - Hello, al. - Get out! - Al, don't. What do I do now? Where do I go? Surely there must be some place where I can be safe. - Pretty, isn't it? Beautiful color. Really smart. - Beautiful. - I see you have luggage. Where are you heading for? - I wish I knew. I'm not heading for any place. You mean you don't have a place to stay? No, I haven't. That's too bad. Say, I think I can help you. Come along, I'll tell you what I have in mind. Come on. Well, you coming? Yeah, I suppose so. - What's your name? Ellen green, I'm from Chicago. You're a long way from home. Well, anyway, my cousin del is looking for a roommate and I'm sure you'll like each other. Well, I'll take you to see her now. That would be very kind of you. Oh, that's all right. As they say in the movies anything to help a damsel in distress. I do appreciate it. Here we are. Door's open, come in. - Hi della, this is Ellen green and this is my cousin, della Boyd. Hello, della. - Hello there. She's cute. Ellen just came into town and doesn't have a place to stay. I knew you were looking for someone to share your apartment and well I thought I'd bring her over to talk to you. - Thanks Tracy. Hope it's all right. - You're a pal. I guess I'd better go now I have a million things to do. I have a heavy date tonight and I want to look my best. I understand. - I'll leave you two alone together to get acquainted. I'm sure you'll get along, that everything will work out fine. Goodbye della, so long Ellen. Goodluck. - Thanks. Come on in. You're very kind. I do appreciate it. Oh, that's all right. Why don't you sit down. - Thanks, I will. I must tell you, I don't have any money but if you let me stay, I'll find work and pay you for everything. - Ah, don't worry about it. You'll earn your keep. - Thank you. Why don't you go inside and unpack. What do you do for a living? Oh, I'm a dancer. An acrobatic dancer. Watch. Say, you are really good. You shouldn't have any trouble getting good job. - I thank you. Hey, did I say something wrong? What are you brooding about? Let's dance. Oh, please. - What's the matter with you? - Leave me alone. - Hi. - Hello Ellen. Oh, I'm tired. I could have helped you shop. - It's all right, doesn't matter. - I wonder if della suspects anything. I must try to act as though nothing is the matter, but I can't. I'd better try to keep out of sight and yet I must look for work. Della has been wonderful to me but I can't continue to impose upon her. Oh, what can I do? I wonder how Ted is. I wonder what he's doing. Does he care what's happening to me? Sometimes I think I'm going crazy just worrying. - Ellen, I'd like to talk to you. What's the matter? You seem so upset. - Oh. - So unhappy. Why don't you tell me what's wrong? I know that something's troubling you. What is it? What's it all about? - Oh, it's nothing. Really, it isn't. - Maybe I can help you. It's nothing I tell you. You're very foolish. If something is bothering you, it's best to talk about it. You know what they say. Two heads are better than one. I'm sure that whatever it is, it can be worked out. - I'm alright. - Okay, Ellen, whatever you say. - Goodbye della. Where are you going Ellen? What's the matter? What's wrong? You have no money. I'll manage somehow. I'll find a job. I'll be all right. - Wait a second. Why are you leaving? You know that I love you. - I know. - I love you too. - Then? - That's why I must go. - Yes? - You have a room for rent. - Yes, come in. My husband. Hello. - Well, this is it and very nice if I must say so myself. - It's nice, I'll take it. - Don't you wanna know what the rent is before you decide to take it, huh? - Of course. How much is it? - $20 a week. - I'll take it. - What's your name? - Ellen, Ellen green. - Where are you from? - Chicago. - I know some friends in Chicago. They live on elm street. You know where that is? - Of course but I don't know many people there. I didn't live there very long, only a few months. I have a few acquaintances in Chicago. - I'm sure you'll make friends in New York. If you want anything, you just have to ask me. - I'm sorry, I'm tired. I'd like to rest. I hope that I can stay here for a while until I can decide what to do. I'm so scared. I'm so miserable. If only I could see Ted again, if only I could talk to him. I'll scream for your wife. Hmm. Companion wanted for semi invalid. That might be just what I want. I hope it isn't too far from here. I think I'll try it. I'm answering your ad for companion. - Come in my dear, I'm Mrs. Thornton. Thank you. - What is your name? - Ellen green. - Where are you from? - Chicago. - Even taking a few steps is too much for me. I remember I used to stay up all night dancing, but now... - I'm tired. May I sit down? - Oh, I'm sorry. Sit down my dear. - Thank you. - I live here alone and can't do for myself anymore. My son, Tom would say I was being full hearty hiring you without references. But you look as though you wouldn't hurt a fly. I like what I see and I'm never wrong. - Thank you, I'm very grateful. - Why do you wanna be a companion to an old woman like me? You are very young and very pretty. - My mother wasn't nimble and I took care of her for two years. Besides it's the only kind of work I really wanna do. - In that case, I understand. Well, the first bedroom to the right will be yours. Why don't you unpack and freshen up. Then you can prepare a snack first and we'll talk about salary and what your duties will be. - All right. - Go ahead my dear. I'll do my very best. Thank you for everything. You play beautifully. No one has touched that piano since my daughter Anne moved to Los Angeles. It's so good to have you here, Ellen but I've been wondering why do you always look so sad so bewildered? Why don't you smile? There, that's better. Ellen my dear. Would you go to the drug store and get my pills for me? I think it'll cost about $2. - Oh, that man followed me. He must have known who I am. Did he see me come in here? Oh, what should I do? I'd better bring the pills in to Mrs. Thornton. - Goodbye. Oh, I've just had the most wonderful news. It's my son, Tom. I'm so excited. He just called me from the station and he'll be here any minute now. Did I tell you Tom's a detective? Right now, he's on a very interesting case. Something about this girl in Boston who killed the janitor in her building and then ran away. Oh, it was cold blooded, but she won't get away. They'll find her all right. They have plenty of clues. They have her fingerprints and a picture of her too. Tom will tell us all about it when he gets here. Ooh, there's Tom now. Tom dear. - Hi mother. How are you? - Fine son. - Good to see you. I'm so glad to have you home. - It's good to be home mother. - Oh, this is Ellen green. Ellen, this is my boy, Tom. Ellen's been taking care of me. I wrote you about her. Ellen's a fine, good girl. - Ellen green. I've seen you some place before. Why are you looking at Ellen like that? - Where are you from? Ellen's from Chicago. Chicago? I've seen you some place before. - What's the matter? - It's strange, but I know I've seen you. You're Meg kelton. You killed amis Wright. - I didn't mean to do it. I didn't mean to do it. - Meg, what's the matter? What is it? - Hold me close. - Now what's wrong? - I had the most horrible dream. - Take it easy, honey. It was only a dream. I left Ed's contract on the chest and couldn't remember the figures. I didn't discover it until I reached the office. My meeting with ed wouldn't have made much sense without these figures and so I had to come back for them. I'm sorry, dear but I won't be home until about five o'clock but you be dressed and we'll go out as we planned. Okay? Now smile. - You don't understand. It was terrible. - Remember, it was only a dream. See you later.
