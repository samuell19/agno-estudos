Break it up! Go home! We don't want trouble. Let us through. We're not leaving. We want to come through. Let us through. We're here to fight for our rights. Break it up! Go home! Withdraw in orderly fashion. We're here to fight for our rights. For our wives and children and our children's children. We want to come through. Let us through. We're here to fight for our rights. Damn it! They're splitting our eardrums. Cops! Pigs! Scum! Swine! Break it up! Go home! Cops! Pigs! Scum! Swine! Stay back! End this demonstration! Break it up, and stop calling us names! Cops! Pigs! Scum! Swine! Guilbaud. I should have known. These peasants stop at nothing. To think I was kind enough to let him lodge here. A Communist! What gall! - Is that you, Guilbaud? - Hello, ma'am. When will you learn not to slam the door? I'm sorry, Madame Langlois. Wait, I must speak to you. I have no time. Don't worry. I'll be brief. You were demonstrating. Don't deny it. Does it bother you? It embarrasses me. Neighbors will talk. Let them talk. Try to understand. During his lifetime, my husband, the colonel, would never have stood for it. And I don't wish to house an anarchist. My ideas are no concern of yours. I pay for my room. If you don't like my ideas, I'll move out. That's not what I meant. - May I come in? - It's your place. I'm crying my eyes out. It's that damned tear gas. The bastards! Would you have a cigarette? I don't have any left. I don't dare go out in the street. I've always been scared of crowds, even during carnival. They're not mild. That's all right. When the colonel was alive, I only smoked army-issue. Guilbaud, don't be angry. All that commotion has set me on edge. The turmoil, the hatred, the tension on both sides - it's too much for me. Try to understand. You and I come from different worlds. That doesn't mean we can't be friends. Friends? Hard to believe. - You refuse my friendship? - I don't give a damn. I've been so lonely since my son died. Tomorrow will be a year since his fatal accident... two years to the day after my husband died. Forgive me. Could you lend me your shoe brush? Yes, of course. What happened to him? My husband? No, your son. He got killed in a stupid accident on his way to Paris. He was doing 110, though he had no reason to hurry. He never worked a day in his life. And the colonel? He died in Indochina. I hadn't seen him in at least five years. We'd been separated for a long time. As for my daughter, that vixen, I might as well be dead. I haven't heard a word from her since she got married - the girl who used to say she'd never find the right man. But she married well. As for me... I lost my title along with my illusions when I married Colonel Langlois. From Baroness de Neuville I became Madame Langlois. Oh, Well. We can't have it all, can we? Would you like some wine? Thanks, but I can't. I have an appointment. Another protest? No, that's over for today. I'm meeting a girl. I assume I needn't remind you I don't want you bringing women here. That's what hotel rooms are for. Do as you like, but do it elsewhere. Do I ask you where you make love? Or how often? Or who with? You're starting to annoy me. You misunderstood. Anyway, I should tell you that with this strike, I won't be able to pay my rent this month. And I'm not leaving until I find another place. I'm not about to go sleep under some bridge. Thanks for telling me. It's nothing, really. Good evening. Guilbaud, before you go, leave me a cigarette. Take the whole pack. - Guilbaud? - It's me. - Edith? - Yes, Mother. - How did you get in? - I still have my key. You have to give it back to me. Why? Did you lose yours? - I just need it. - You must have a lover. At least spare me that kind of humor. So you're back. What have you done since you got married? Not much. I thought you'd forgotten me. Take off your coat. I'm not staying, Mother. What's the situation in the streets? It's quiet. Smells like pig. Cops everywhere. I got stopped on the way here. Shows how much I wanted to see you. I was talking about you not five minutes ago. With whom? My boarder. I didn't think you saw anyone. A boarder - what a strange idea. Your father's pension isn't enough to pay off the debts your brother racked up. Last month I had to rent out your room. You rented out my old room? Why not Philippe's? Your brother's room? Never. It's been locked up since he died. I haven't touched a thing. I'll never have the courage to open the door and face all those memories. Don't be so melodramatic. You wouldn't understand. Stop pacing like that. - My legs are tingling. - Are you wearing stockings? I haven't for two years now. - What's your boarder do? - He's on strike. That's not what I meant. He works in the shipyard. He's a fitter or a toolmaker. So he's a metalworker? Why do you ask? Are you suddenly interested in the plight of the working class? Not at the moment, but the other day my fortune-teller predicted I'd have a great love affair... with a metalworker. Will you stay for dinner? No, Edmond must be waiting. You never bothered to write, you know. You could have sent a postcard. A postcard? I never even left our apartment. Weren't you going away on a honeymoon? You mean Morocco? We didn't go. Did Edmond change his mind? No, I did. He's a disappointment. In what way? Want me to draw you a picture? I hate that expression. I've told you so a hundred times. Father used to say it. That's no excuse. Just come out with it and stop beating around the bush. I can tell you. It's no secret. His family knows. Edmond is impotent. You think it's fun? - You're going about it wrong. - That's the best one yet! I should know. You just don't love him. If you did, you'd know how to - That's enough! In fact, you've never loved anyone. It's not that I don't love Edmond, but I'm disappointed with his stinginess and jealousy. Right this moment, I haven't got a penny on me. Serves you right. You only married him for his money. A TV salesman! A real Prince Charming. You don't know what I've been through. I have to beg and implore him. You never had Father around the house, but Edmond's after me all day long. He follows me around. He wakes me up at night and wants to know if I'm thinking of him. He questions me and hounds me. It's hell! Here's your key. Could you lend me some money? I really am broke. What's this? It's a cap. I can see that. Whose is it? Guilbaud's. He must have forgotten it. His name is Guilbaud? Yes, François Guilbaud. Have you been waiting long? Just five minutes. Did you see the cops? The streets are full of 'em. Then protect me, François. Hold me tight. Violette, you're flushed. Because I ran. Violets are like that. They blush when they're happy. When they're not, they fade and wither away. What did you do today? I loafed and wandered around. I don't know what to do with myself all day. Take advantage of it and rest. I can't sleep. I'm up at 6:00, as if I had to punch the clock. A customer at the shop told me about the riot in front of the police station. The cops held us back. We couldn't get through. And they used their rotten teargas. We had to disperse, but next time we'll fight. You'll win. Are you sure? Yes, because I love you. I love you, François. I want to live with you now. I feel cold without you. Let's get married, François. With this strike? City hall isn't on strike. I'm dead broke right now. The strike won't last. And I'm still working. I can't even pay the baroness this month. Oh, don't feel sorry for her. We'll rent a studio. You can move out of that old hag's place at last. I want a room for us alone. You understand, François. Come, l'll take you to dinner. I told Mother I'd be home late. I can't. Dambiel's waiting for me. Ménager is assigning picketers for the strike. Go and picket, my love. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Come by the shop for me. Don't forget. I love you so, François! Let night give way to dawn... and dawn will bring a new day. A day of light at last... a day of hope, peace, and happiness. We're resuming negotiations. The workers of Saint-Nazaire will be joining us. Hold on! - How do we eat? - A support committee's been set up. If negotiations don't succeed, we march Thursday on the police station. And the cops? Same tactics. No violence. How you doing? Fine. We're on the picket line until 11:00. Ménager just drew up the list. We have to hold out. I know. I heard. Don't look so glum. Anyone would think you're peeved. It's not that. I can hold out. I have no mouths to feed. - Then what is it? - Nothing. It's Violette. She's not behind us? Yes, but she wants to get married... and this is hardly the right time. No money, no job. Soon I won't have a place to stay. Come to our place and bunk with the kid. Something wrong between you and Violette? I don't know. She's crazy about me, while I just pretend. I'm fond of her. I think she's nice. But I don't want to live with her. She dreams. She makes plans. She's happy, but I can't dream. I can't make plans. Her love scares me. I don't know how to tell her. Be careful. What do you mean? You mustn't hurt her. I know. Still, I feel like leaving her. I didn't expect you so early. François couldn't stay with me. - Have you had dinner? - Not yet. Will you be much longer? I'm almost done. What is it? You look different. I'm happy, that's all. Mother, if I married François and left here to live with him, would you be angry? Of course not. I'd be happy for you. You know that. If my leaving would make you unhappy, I wouldn't go. You worry too much about me. Think of yourself first, of your own life. I've lived mine. One, two, three, four, five. It's him again. The metalworker? That's him. One, two, three, four, five. How wonderful! Don't say a word. I don't like this. Please, Madame Sforza! It's the other one. Edmond! It's serious, isn't it? You must be on your guard. What should I do? I just told you. I see nothing more. The cards are silent. - Where were you? - At Mother's. It's almost 9:00. And this afternoon? I couldn't get through the demonstration. All hell broke loose, but you don't care about the strike. I care, but I'm not a metalworker. After all, TV salesmen never go on strike. Why not? I'd like to see you! You're such a coward. - What are you doing? - Taking some money. You didn't sell much today. Edith, give it back. I forbid you to take it. I need it to balance my books. I couldn't buy a thing today. You just said you were at your mother's. I couldn't even pay Madame Sforza. You think she enjoys doing it for free? I don't want you seeing that old whore again. I don't work all week so you can blow all my money on fortune-tellers. Let me go. You're hurting me. Bastard! You did that on purpose. You burned me with your soldering iron. I have a blister. Forgive me. Bastard! I didn't mean to. You and your damned soldering iron! Keep your rotten money. I don't want it. I'll get money some other way. Now let me go, you dirty bastard! Please calm down, darling. Torturer! SS! I didn't mean to do it. Please forgive me. Listen to me. I swear. You should be ashamed! You walk around like that? It's your fault. I have nothing to wear. That's no excuse. So now you're a streetwalker? The strikers must have loved it. Get out! Put on some clothes! Don't come back until you're decent! You don't have to tell me twice. I warn you: I've had it. You won't see me again anytime soon. Edith, come back. I didn't mean it. Take the money. You can have it. I spoke without thinking. You disgust me. Darling, please come back. You know I love you. You can do as you like. I could never live without you. It's too much to bear. I'm so miserable! I love you, Edith. Edith, I'm such an idiot! Shit. I left my cap in the cafe'. You weren't wearing it when you got here. Really? That's right. Now I know. I left it at my place. See you tomorrow. Yeah, see you tomorrow. Good evening. Shocked? Or just afraid l'll catch cold? Is that all? You saw what matters. Well, what about it? You've come along at a bad time. I'm on strike at the moment. I'm not. I'm broke. Oh, I don't care about the money. Come on, sweetie. It's late. You should be in bed. I've never made love with such a beautiful girl. I've never made love with a guy I liked as much as you. So you're not a real whore? I only work half-time. Give me my coat. I'm a little cold. What's this? My husband beat me. - And this? - It's a burn. Dirty bastard! Funny you should say that. Those were my exact words. And he's stingy and jealous too. I walk the streets to get even with him. And we've only been married a month. Can you believe it? Not really. - Are you married? - No. - In other words you're free. - Exactly. And with this strike, I have lots of time on my hands. What do you do? I'm a fitter and toolmaker. You know what that is? Of course. You're a metalworker. You surprised I know? It's nothing terribly exciting. My fortune-teller predicted... I'd have a great love affair with a metalworker. Do you believe in the cards? I have no choice now that I've met you. There are thousands of metalworkers in Nantes. - You're so handsome. - You're so beautiful. I love the softness of your skin. I love the softness in your eyes. What's your name? François. I'd like to see you again, but you can't come to my place. I rent a room from a crazy old baroness who was married to a colonel. She doesn't want me to bring girls home. By any chance, is your name Guilbaud? How did you know? The crazy baroness, as you call her, is my mother. My name is Edith. - Who's there? - Your son-in-lam. Are you mad? You know what time it is? Is she in her room? Who do you mean? - Your daughter. - Why? She's gone. She stormed out. She hasn't come home, and I'm worried. I thought she might be here. Girls usually go home to mother after an argument. She's not the type. My little Edith! Where can she be? It's all my fault. I'm sure of that. Please, that's enough. What happened exactly? Oh, it was nothing. You know how she is. We were talking quietly when she suddenly got mad. From what I've heard, she's not entirely to blame. What are you insinuating? Edith told me certain things. So now she comes crying to mother! She confided in me because she's unhappy. What did she say? She admitted you weren't always - how shall I say? - up to your ambitions in bed. - What can I do about it? - I don't know. See a doctor. There must be a cure. Edith's a decent girl. She'll come back to you. Decent! I caught her with her hand in the till. She went walking around today naked under her fur coat. She dared tell me she had nothing to wear. You asked for it, my dear. Where can she be? What'll become of me without her? You should have given her some money. What if she's killed herself? You don't know her. I'll call the police. They have their hands full with the strikers. My poor Edith! Oh, what have I done? You're not going to stay here moaning all night. Go home and take a shower. I'm sure she's home by now, waiting like a good little girl. That bitch! Get a hold of yourself. I've always hated vulgarity, and I won't have you insulting her to my face. She's far from perfect, but still - You think she has a lover? I never said that. You're imagining things. Someone you know. Someone she knew before me and ran into again. And to think I was worrying about her, that I was ready to forgive! You know him, don't you? That's enough, my friend. You're completely mad. You know everything that's going on. You're protecting them both. I warn you, if I find them together, l'll kill them both! If you see her, tell her that. Because I love Edith - and l'll kill her! - Stay away! - I'll kill her, you hear? My poor man, you'll end up before a judge. Look. It's already daylight. I have to go now. Tell me more. Mother died one day as well. I came to work in Nantes. I looked for a room in town. I came to your mother's by chance. So you're a real country boy. My darling Guilbaud. You're handsome even with circles under your eyes. I feel so good in your arms. Let me tell you that I love you. I'd like to stay with you, but I can't. It's daylight. - I have to go. - Please don't. When will I see you again? Tonight, if you wish. Come here tonight at 8:00. Give me the strength to wait for you. I need you so. Dambiel. Violette, you're up early. Something wrong? I'd like to see François. He'll be here at 10:00. It was a late night yesterday. That's too bad. I wanted to talk to him. He must still be at the baroness's. I don't want to go there. Why? She scares me. Don't be silly. She won't eat you. Is it urgent? Not really. Well, it is for me. What should I tell him? Nothing. It's not that serious. Is it a secret? Not really. Your wife already knows. I'm pregnant. Oh, shit! Don't say that. I'm happy. I'm sure it will help François make up his mind to marry me. We had no real reason to get married before. It's different now, you see. Don't you think? I wouldn't know. I do, and that's why... I wanted to tell him myself. You can wait if you'd like. I can't. I don't want to be late. The floor manager is on my case. I've felt faint a few times. I know him. He'll make trouble. You won't tell François, will you? I'm counting on you. I swear. You'll be the godfather. Sure. Listen to me! Negotiations failed. Saint-Nazaire will join us when we march on Thursday. Will this last long? At least six more months. We have to hold on. Marching got us nowhere. We mustn't give up. Quiet! There's worse news. Management decided today to lay off the most recent hires. That's a dirty move! Talks will resume tomorrow, and we won't accept the layoffs. The following men have been fired: Jousse, Fournier, Le Gloanec, Guilbaud... Ma'am, I've come to see Guilbaud. He's not here. Are you sure? I'm telling you. That's too bad. Perhaps he's still in his room. He's not, believe me. He didn't come home last night. Not that it's any of my business. Do you know where he is? I haven't the faintest idea. Would you tell him l'll wait for him at the cafe' until 10:00? - Is that you, Guilbaud? - Good morning. Don't look at me. I look awful. Yes, I must say you do look terrible. You should see yourself. I was up all night. So was I, but for a different reason. My son-in-law woke me up at 2:00. His wife had run off. She'll be back. He was upset, naturally. They'd had an argument, but I never got the full story. I wonder what she said to drive him to such a state. He's usually so level-headed. - She's fed up. - How do you know? Just talking. If you knew her, you'd understand. She has a nasty temper. She's always rebelled against everything. What did the other one say? What other one? Her husband. He was a bit on edge, but I calmed him down. He finally left, but by then it was almost 3:00. I imagine she's home by now. Newlyweds are always bickering. Ah, I forgot. A friend came by for you, the one who always looks like he's smiling. - That's Dambiel. - He's waiting at the cafe'. You could have told me sooner. Are you going out? For five minutes, to see a friend. François, my love, you're here! I love you so. I found myself all alone in that dreary room, - and I got afraid. - Of what? I don't know. Afraid you were just a dream. Afraid I'd lost you. I couldn't wait till tonight. I'm here, darling. What's the meaning of this? You really need an explanation? Will you stop talking to me like I'm an idiot? I think it's very clear. You should tell her, darling. I didn't ask you. Stay out of this. And you could at least shut the door. You'll have all the neighbors talking. Well? I don't have to justify my actions. I'm of age. I love François, and he loves me. Well, your loving husband waited for you here all night with razor in hand. He was beside himself. Mad with jealousy. He threatened me. He wants your hide. Look what that asshole did to my “hide”! Don't be so vulgar. He's a brute, a sadist. Look! You mustn't see him again. That's enough out of you. Go join your friend. - I'll be back. - Hurry, darling. I suggest you find another room. And I suggest you keep your mouth shut. Pay no attention to her. Hurry back. - Where are you going? - My room. It's Guilbaud's room now. I don't give a damn. - I want to move back in. - With Guilbaud? I'm not putting up with the two of you. Edmond will kill you both, and me while he's at it! You won't protect me? I'm helpless, hounded, persecuted! You'd throw me and my lover out in the street? - You admit he's your lover? - I never hid it. - Where did you meet him? - In the street. - How long have you known him? - None of your business. I'd rather give you Philippe's room than have you two in the same bed in my house. I'm throwing him out anyway. Then we'll both go. Don't you understand I love him? Don't you know what love is? You really take me for an ass. Or what passion is? Or obsession? You must be kidding. Nothing else matters anymore. I'm in love for the first time. Words seem too empty to express such powerful feelings. I love his skin, his scent, his strength, his tenderness, his laugh. I miss him when he's barely left my side. I want him to touch me, to have me... to take me away. And nothing you can say will make any difference. I won't leave Guilbaud... ever. So I'm out of a job yet on strike. It's kind of funny. You seem optimistic. I'm not about to start crying. There's no justice. We'll fight it. Justice? Come off it. You believe in that? No, I believe in solidarity, and friendship too. Maybe I'm too idealistic. And don't tell me I'm wrong to be. Then let's drink to our friendship. To friendship. You look tired. I got no sleep. Something wonderful has happened. I know. I saw Violette. It has nothing to do with Violette. I never thought it possible. I don't understand it myself. I thought I loved Violette, but that wasn't love. With Edith it's as if my life is just beginning. It's like some new strength inside me... that will sustain me and help me go on living. What's wrong? Don't you believe me? Yes, but I was thinking about Violette. What's to become of her? I'll explain things to her. It wasn't really serious between us. She came looking for you this morning. What did she want? I... I don't know. I'll see her tonight. I'll talk to her. Good morning, ma'am. Is François in? He's on strike. That's why I thought he'd be in. Well, you thought wrong. - Who is it? - It's for Guilbaud, not you. And don't ask me where he might be! Could you tell him Violette would like to see him? Tell him it's urgent. No, don't. He might worry. As you wish. Just tell him Violette stopped by. Your father loved this sonata, though he had no ear for music. Who rang? A girl named Violette. She asked for Guilbaud. What did she want? That's none of my business. Your Guilbaud seems like quite a Don Juan. Spare me your comments, please. Can I borrow this suitcase? Where are you going? - To see Edmond. - Don't go! - I need my things. - Please don't go! He's capable of anything. Don't worry. He's a coward. He'll fall to his knees and beg my forgiveness. He'll beg me to stay. Relax. I know him well. He was out of his mind. He was there, in the hall. I can see him now. I'm in no danger. The cards are on my side. I fear the worst. Please don't go. He might kill you. I'm not taking any chances. Edith, you mustn't. Leave the gun here. Don't be ridiculous. I want everything settled, for his sake and ours. Please think it over. - I know what I'm doing. - You're just like your father! Thanks a lot. Good evening, ma'am. What a pity. Violette is out. She went to the store. Please come in. That might be her now. I know her footsteps. François, my darling. Aren't you coming in? Come, let's take a little walk. Will you stay for dinner after that? I can't. There's plenty. No, I really can't. Mother, I'm going for a walk with François. I looked for you all day. Did they tell you? Yes, Dambiel said you wanted to see me. I called for you at that old frump's place. Was it that urgent? In a way, it was. I had good news for you. And I have bad news. I've been laid off. Is that all? You had me scared. It's not really the end of the world. You'll find another job. Now, then... can't you guess? I'm pregnant. Are you sure? Positive. I'm so happy- Can you believe it? Your child. A little Guilbaud. What's wrong? Say something. Please answer me, François. My little Violette, this is unfortunate. I don't understand. I had a speech all prepared. I wasn't expecting this. But it's not your fault. It's not true! Look at me. This can't be true, can it? My little Violette, I don't want to hurt you. I love another girl. She's my whole life. No, please don't cry. This is so hard. Shut up, François. Go away! It's not my fault. Listen to me. Leave me alone. Please just go away! It hurts too much. I never want to see you again. Watch out, my friend. You'll get wet. Don't bother to lock it, Edmond. I'm not staying. You're wrong, my sweet. You're not leaving. I came to get my things. I've forgiven you. The slate is clean. I won't even ask where you've been. See? I'm not jealous. You refuse to understand. It's over. I don't love you. I want a divorce. We'll start a new life together. We'll be happier than ever before. You're wrong. You'd better take me seriously. I'm serious too. I'm not joking. I'll prove to you I'm not fooling around. What are you doing? I closed the cage door. The birdie's not leaving now. You're mad. - You'll never leave me. - How little you know me! And if you did leave, you'd be so unhappy. You'd always regret it. Talk all you like! My mind's made up. Edmond, no! Put that razor away! You're scared. Now you know I'm serious. You're afraid to shoot. Your hand's shaking. No, it's not. You'd better be careful. My love, my pretty whore, I love you madly, just the way you are. Stop this madness or l'll shoot. My very own whore. Shut up, I tell you! You're mine! Please stop! You're mine, and you'll never forget me! Oh, that stool! It's so ugly. Don't you think? I'm going to sell it. In fact, I should get rid of all this. Don't you agree? - You've been drinking. - Not really. Is Edith here? She hasn't come back. I did my best to stop her from making such a horrible mistake. What mistake? My daughter a criminal - that's all I need! Where is she? She went to Edmond's - right into the lion's mouth. - I'm going there. - I forbid you! You're not a member of the family yet. Besides, she won't be long now. Thank you. Come have a drink with me. I'm sure it will cheer you up. You've had enough. You don't want any? Your loss. You're already plastered. I find your language amusing. Where do you get words like “plastered”? Here's to your health, my dear. You're shocked to see “the bourgeoisie” let its hair down. Well, the bourgeoisie can go to hell. I'm not one of them. I'll tell you something: I like you much more than I do the bourgeois. You and your colleagues are fighting for something. You're fighting for survival, just like myself, while the bourgeois and all their possessions rot away. They wallow in their comforts. Well, I swear l'll never be one of them. - Edith! - It's awful! My child! What happened? Please calm down. Blood! Darling, you're hurt! Say something! Can't you see that I can't? Give her your handkerchief. She'll bleed to death. I'm thirsty. Quick, get a glass of water. Edmond slashed his throat right before my eyes. How horrible! He went mad when he saw me. He called me names and threatened me. He circled around me waving his razor. He was laughing, weeping. I thought I was going mad. I took out my gun, but only to scare him. He stood right in front of me and said, “Edith, you're mine. You'll never forget me.” Try to calm down, darling. I'll never forget his face and his cries. Hold me in your arms, François. I love you. Please don't leave me. I'm here at your side, my love. I love you. Now I'm free. Someone rang. Go and hide. You're covered in blood. - Are you expecting someone? - No, no one. Stay here. You can hardly walk. It's you. Am I intruding? Not at all. It's dark in here. I can't see a thing. Ls the baroness in? I don't know. She must be in her room. What is it? It's about tomorrows demonstration. We're gathering at the cathedral. We can go together. I'll wait at the yard. The cops will be there. You okay? Sure. - Doesn't look it. - I'm fine. - Did you see Violette? - I did. She was sad. Well, see you tomorrow. Yeah, see you then. I found these boxes in a closet. In this apartment I'm reliving my entire childhood... a past I thought was forgotten. This doll was mine. I dressed her myself. These memories make me both happy and sad. They trouble me and yet move me deeply... like you, my dear François. My darling, I love you so! My life begins with you. I owe this happiness to you. You should be at work. Why? I don't want to see anyone. I'm so disappointed. Then come hold this down for me. You shouldn't get upset like this. You think it's fun feeling rejected and abandoned? You did nothing wrong. His decision may not be final. I don't care what he decides. I never want to see him again. And the child? I'll raise it. You'll help me. Together we'll find a way. - Where are you going? - To see that girl. - What for? - I just want to. Violette, come back. Listen to me. Let night give way to dawn, and dawn will bring a new day. A day of light at last... a day of hope, peace, and happiness. Break it up! Go home! We don't want any trouble. Let us through. We're not leaving. Break it up! Go home! Withdraw in orderly fashion. Let us through. We're not leaving. We want to come through. We're not backing down. We're here to fight for our rights. Break it up! Go home! Withdraw in orderly fashion. There they go again. There are more of them today. Last time they used tear gas. You couldn't breathe the air. As usual, Guilbaud's on the front line. - I'm afraid. - Oh, you have nothing to fear! I'm afraid for François. If anything happened to him, I don't think I could go on. If he were arrested, I couldn't bear it. And if he died, I couldn't go on living. How can you love him so? He's become an essential part of my life. I have to know he's near me. I need his warmth. I couldn't go to sleep without his caresses, and I couldn't wake up without his sweet smile. I couldn't go on living. Good morning. Guilbaud's not in. He's demonstrating. I'm not here to see him. What do you want, then? To see your daughter. She's not available at the moment. Are you Edith? Who are you? My name will mean nothing to you. I'm a friend of François. Has he ever spoken to you about me? Why would he? Should he have? I'm expecting his child. Please, young lady! I have nothing to say to you! You can be so annoying! Let her speak. You took François from me. I'll keep the child. So you see, now we're even. That's not my concern. Why are you here? To see the look on your faces! Well, I've seen enough of yours. I don't care what happened between you two. He loves me, and I love him. No more arguing, please! There's enough fighting already. Will you shut up? It's starting again. They'll use their tear gas again. Cops! Pigs! Scum! Swine! Stay back! End this demonstration! Break it up, and stop calling us names! François! What happened? Call an ambulance, quick. Come inside. François, how did it happen? Two cops were clubbing Ménager. François jumped in to help him and got clubbed himself. He's lost a lot of blood. He's coming to. You mustn't move. Listen to me, Edith. I'm here, my François. I need you so. You know how much I love you. Don't leave me! Edith, I'm going to die. No, you're not going to die. A doctor's coming. We'll take care of you. You'll see. Edith, say something! Where are you? I can't hear you anymore. Darling, you have to live for my sake! Edith... my life... François, my love! I could never live without you. Don't do it, Edith! François, my love.
