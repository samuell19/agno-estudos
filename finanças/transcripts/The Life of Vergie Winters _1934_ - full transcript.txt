MY, THAT HAT'S BECOMING TO YOU! YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR WE ALL THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO BREAK UP THAT ENGAGEMENT OF JOHN'S. AND I DON'T KNOW YET WHY YOU DIDN'T.

Winters: WELL, I AIN'T. TAKE THAT OTHER BOX OVER THERE. I SUPPOSE YOU HEARD THAT JOHN SHADWELL GOT HOME TODAY WITH HIS NEW WIFE. I SUPPOSE HE HAD TO COME BACK SOME TIME. I GOT TO GO UP TO THE DEPOT AND GET THEIR TRUNKS. IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR HIM, YOU AND VERGIE MIGHT BE MARRIED BY NOW. OH, I DON'T KNOW. VERGIE NEVER SAID SHE'D MARRY ME. THAT SHE WOULD.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH, McQUEEN. HERE'S THE MONEY FOR THE TRUNKS. SAY, THIS IS TOO MUCH! [DOORBELL JINGLES] VERGIE. HOW ARE YOU, JOHN? VERGIE, IF YOU DIDN'T MARRY HUGO McQUEEN... I NEVER INTENDED TO. YOUR FATHER SAID YOU DID. WAS THAT WHY YOU LEFT WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE? HE TOLD ME THAT-- HE SAID THAT-- HE SAID WHAT, JOHN? HE SAID IT WAS NECESSARY THAT HUGO MARRY YOU. HE SAID WHAT? I MUST HAVE BEEN CRAZY TO HAVE BELIEVED HIM. MY FATHER SAID THAT-- WHY SHOULD HE TELL SUCH A LIE? I DON'T KNOW. BUT HE TOLD ME I HAD TO GIVE YOU UP AND WHY. IT WASN'T TRUE! I CAN'T BELIEVE MY OWN FATHER WOULD-- OH! OH, THAT'S WHAT THAT MONEY WAS FOR! WHAT MONEY? MAYBE I SHOULDN'T TELL YOU... YOU'VE GOT TO TELL ME, VERGIE. [SIGHS] HE NEVER WOULD TELL ME WHY HE SHOULD RECEIVE $10,000. FROM WHOM? YOUR WIFE'S FATHER. MY WIFE'S FATHER? I SAW THE CHECK. MY FATHER GOT $10,000 FOR TELLING YOU THAT LIE. OH, VERGIE. I WENT CRAZY. I HAD TO GET OUT OF TOWN OR KILL EVERYBODY IN IT. WELL, THEY DID ABOUT AS THEY PLEASED WITH US, DIDN'T THEY? DO YOU LOVE ME, VERGIE? ,, THERE HASN'T BEEN A DAY I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF YOU. [BAND PLAYING] I SUPPOSE ALL YOU BANKERS ARE SUPPORTING JOHN SHADWELL FOR CONGRESS, AREN'T YOU, MR. TRUESDALE? WELL, I AM. MY WIFE MAKES ME! IF THE WOMEN COULD VOTE, HE'D BE ELECTED ALL RIGHT! WELL, HE WOULDN'T GET MY VOTE. WHY NOT, PEARL? BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE A MAN IN PUBLIC OFFICE MAKING A FOOL OF HIMSELF OVER A WOMAN. WHAT WOMAN? WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW-- VERGIE WINTERS. ELLA AND I SAW THEM COMING OUT OF WATERWORKS PARK LAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT, AND IT WAS PAST 11:00. OH, THERE'S PROBABLY SOME PERFECTLY GOOD EXPLANATION. I OFTEN WALK MY DOG THROUGH THE PARK.

OH, THIS IS FUN! HELLO, GEORGE. HURRY UP, FLORENCE! WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE AN INTERESTING EVENING. I WONDER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FELLOW CITIZENS OF PARKVILLE, WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TONIGHT IN HAVING WITH US A MAN WHO RAISES POLITICS TO THE DIGNITY OF STATESMANSHIP. Crowd: HOORAY! HOORAY! JOHN SHADWELL WAS BORN IN THIS TOWN. HIS GRANDFATHER, PARK SHADWELL WAS ONE OF ITS FIRST SETTLERS. Shadwell, thinking: WHAT DULL PEOPLE THERE ARE IN THIS TOWN! BUT I CHOSE WISELY. JOHN WAS BORN TO SUCCEED. IT WON'T BE LONG TILL WE'RE IN WASHINGTON. Vergie, thinking: DEAR JOHN, MY HEART SINGS WHEN I LOOK AT YOU. IN SPITE OF ALL OF THEM, YOU'RE MINE. MINE! THERE SHE IS. I MUST LOOK AT HER... COOLLY... AS THOUGH SHE WERE SOMEONE ELSE. I WONDER IF SHE LOVES HIM. AM I STEALING FROM HER, OR DID SHE STEAL FROM ME? SHE'S LOOKING AT ME. I MUST LOOK AWAY. Thinking: I WONDER WHO THAT GIRL IS. WHAT MADE ME LOOK AT HER? Shadwell, thinking: WHAT A NICE TOWN. CERTAINLY EASY TO LIKE, FINE, SIMPLE PEOPLE. I SHALL REPRESENT THEM TO THE VERY BEST OF MY ABILITY. I WONDER WHERE VERGIE IS. THERE SHE IS... DARLING. POOR LAURA. IT'S ALL MY FAULT. I WONDER HOW I'M GOING TO TELL HER. WHAT SHALL I DO? I MUST LISTEN TO THIS SPEECH! WHAT IS HE SAYING? Man:...WANT MEN WHO WILL CARRY ON THAT GOVERNMENT-- MEN OF INTEGRITY... Boy, thinking: GEE, SADIE'S PRETTY. I'LL BET NO ONE'S EVER KISSED HER. I'M GOING TO ASK HER TO MARRY ME WHEN I GET A RAISE. Woman, thinking: I WONDER WHAT THAT GUY'S TALKING ABOUT. GOSH, WHAT A BURG. I'VE GOT TO GET TO A BIG CITY AND MEET A FELLOW WITH A LOT OF MONEY. OH, WELL. IT WAS ONLY PUPPY LOVE, ANYWAY. IT IS WITH A SENSE OF PERSONAL PRIDE AND PLEASURE THAT I NOW INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN WHO NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION. MR. JOHN SHADWELL, YOUR NEXT CONGRESSMAN. [CROWD CHEERING] Man: WELL DONE, MR. SHADWELL, OLD BOY. I SHALL BE VERY PROUD IF YOU DECIDE THAT YOU WANT ME TO REPRESENT YOU IN WASHINGTON. [CROWD CHEERING] IF I AM ELECTED TO CONGRESS, MY FIRST JOB WILL BE TO TRY TO GET A CANAL THROUGH FROM HERE TO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER! [CROWD SHOUTS AND CHEERS] [PIANO PLAYING] [ITALIAN ACCENT] I BET SHADWELL'S GOING TO BE ELECTED. I THINK IF SHADWELL'S ELECTED AND PUTS THAT CANAL THROUGH, I'LL CLEAN UP ON THAT PROPERTY OF MINE. HE'S GOT TO BE TOLD THE CANAL GOES THROUGH THEM FLATS. SHADWELL DON'T ALWAYS LISTEN TO WHAT HE'S TOLD. HE'LL LISTEN IF HE WANTS THE VOTES WITH HIS NAME ON THEM COUNTED. HEY, TOM! Tom: YES, BOSS. FRESHEN THEM UP OVER HERE. [DOORBELL JINGLES] HOW DO YOU DO, MISS WINTERS? I'M MR. PRESTON. YES, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE, MR. PRESTON. OH, AND MY SON BARRY. HOW DO YOU DO? HOW DO YOU DO, MISS WINTERS? I WONDER IF I MIGHT SPEAK TO YOU PRIVATELY, MISS WINTERS. WHY, CERTAINLY. DO YOU MIND STEPPING THIS WAY? THANK YOU. HELLO, KIDDO. HELLO, BARRY. YOU GOT A DATE TONIGHT? MM-HMM. I SUPPOSE YOU COULD BREAK IT IF YOU WANTED TO, COULDN'T YOU? I MIGHT. NOT THAT I BELIEVE THE GOSSIP. IT ISN'T THAT. IT'S JUST THAT I CAN'T GIVE MY POLITICAL SUPPORT TO A MAN WHO LAYS HIMSELF OPEN TO A... WELL, A...POSSIBLE SCANDAL. YOU UNDERSTAND ME, DON'T YOU, MISS WINTERS? QUITE. YOU SEE, I THINK I CAN SAY, IN ALL MODESTY, WITH MY INFLUENCE, JOHN SHADWELL WILL BE ELECTED TO CONGRESS. WITHOUT IT, HE HASN'T A CHANCE. I HAVE NO DOUBT OF THAT, MR. PRESTON. SO I CAME TO ASK YOU-- I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME TO ME, MR. PRESTON. OTHERWISE, I MIGHT NEVER HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT A WRONG IMPRESSION ABOUT MR. SHADWELL. OH, THEN IT IS WRONG. YES. MR. SHADWELL CAME HERE A FEW TIMES AS MY LAWYER. THERE WERE MATTERS TO BE ADJUSTED ABOUT MY BUSINESS. OF COURSE. I CAN QUITE UNDERSTAND. BUT THAT IS FINISHED NOW. THERE WILL BE NO FURTHER OCCASION FOR MR. SHADWELL TO SEE ME... EITHER HERE OR ANYWHERE ELSE. I'M VERY GLAD I CAME, MISS WINTERS. I KNOW I CAN RELY ON YOUR WORD. THANK YOU, MR. PRESTON. HE'S AS GOOD AS ELECTED. IT WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE, WOULDN'T IT, TO ALLOW ANY GOSSIP TO INTERFERE WITH HIS CAREER. I UNDERSTAND. GOOD-BYE, MR. PRESTON. GOOD-BYE, MISS WINTERS. [KNOCKING] MY SWEET! JOHN! I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY JUST FOR THIS MOMENT. AND I'VE BEEN SO HAPPY ALL DAY, I COULDN'T EVEN QUARREL WITH THE COMMITTEE. WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING SINCE I SAW YOU LAST? WELL, THIS AFTERNOON, I HAD A VERY IMPORTANT CALLER. HOW IMPORTANT? THE HONORABLE LLEWELLYN PRESTON. PRESTON? WHAT DID HE WANT? IT SEEMS WE'RE ALREADY A SCANDAL. THE GENTLEMAN CONSIDERS ME A MENACE TO YOUR CAREER. I'LL TAKE CARE OF MY CAREER, YOUNG LADY. I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT YOU CAME HERE ONLY AS MY LAWYER AND THAT OUR BUSINESS WAS OVER WITH. I PROMISED HIM THAT YOU WOULD NEVER COME HERE AGAIN. VERGIE, YOU SOUND AS THOUGH YOU REALLY MEANT THAT. I'VE GOT TO MEAN IT. YOU LOVE ME, DON'T YOU? OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER ME. WE BOTH KNOW THAT. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE WE CAN DO, JOHN. VERGIE, I'M GOING TO ASK LAURA TO DIVORCE ME. OH, YOU CAN'T! THAT WOULD BE A SCANDAL. YOU'D LOSE THE PRESTON SUPPORT, AND... I WON'T LET YOU. WHAT IF I DO LOSE THE ELECTION? YOU WON'T. IF WINNING MEANS GIVING YOU UP, IT ISN'T WORTH IT. I'LL NEVER LET YOU GO. AS LONG AS I LIVE, I'LL NEVER LET YOU GET AWAY FROM ME. WE BELONG TO EACH OTHER. I'M GIVING YOU UP BECAUSE IT MEANS YOUR WHOLE FUTURE, JOHN. PEOPLE JUST DON'T SANCTION DIVORCES. MUST YOU CUT YOUR HEART OUT FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING THEM? YOU MUST, JOHN... AND SO MUST I. VERGIE, DO YOU IMAGINE THAT TWO PEOPLE WHO REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER COULD EVER SAY GOOD-BYE? WE'LL WORK IT OUT SOMEHOW. I'M THINKING-- DON'T THINK. JUST LOVE ME. [CLOCK CHIMING] I'M SORRY. GOOD EVENING, MR. SHADWELL! GOOD EVENING. I'LL BET HE'S BEEN TO SEE MISS WINTERS. WHAT RIGHT YOU GOT TO SAY THAT? THAT'S THE WAY STORIES START IN THIS BURG. WELL, WHAT'S HE DOING ALONG HERE THIS TIME OF NIGHT? HE LIVES UP THE STREET. AND BESIDES, MISS WINTERS IS A LADY. SURE, SHE IS, AND YOU STICK UP FOR HER...INNOCENT. OH, I AIN'T SO INNOCENT. YOU ARE.

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? TO A SHOW. BE CAREFUL. MA WILL HEAR US. SHE WON'T HEAR US. SHE'S ASLEEP. HEY, COME ON. I GOT SOMETHING I WANT TO TELL YOU. [KEY TURNING IN LOCK] [FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] Laura, thinking: I'M GLAD HE DIDN'T COME IN. OURS IS A SENSIBLE MARRIAGE. THERE'S NO NECESSITY IN BEING EMOTIONAL. I'M STILL MRS. JOHN SHADWELL. [DOORBELL JINGLES] Woman: HELLO, SADIE. Sadie: HOW DO YOU DO, MRS. LENNON? HOW DO YOU DO, MRS. JONES? Mrs. Jones: HOW ARE YOU, SADIE? Sadie: OH, MISS WINTERS!

BUT HE'S A CONGRESSMAN FROM THIS DISTRICT, AND HE HAS TO KEEP A RESIDENCE HERE. IT'S GOOD OF HER, EVEN IF I DID TAKE IT MYSELF. I HAVE TO GET USED TO HER. SHE WAS SO TINY. I THINK SHE'S WONDERFUL. I PEEK AT HER 20 TIMES A DAY. IT'S UNCANNY... I ALMOST FEEL I'M LOOKING AT YOU. HOW HAVE YOU EXPLAINED HER? SHE'S THE CHILD OF AN OLD AND VERY DEAR FRIEND.

MY, IF THAT KEEPS UP, OUR DOORBELL'S GOING TO GET RUSTY. DON'T LOOK SO SOLEMN, LULU. IF IT'S YOUR JOB YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT-- WELL, THAT'S PARTLY IT. FORGET IT. WE'LL MANAGE SOMEHOW. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE, ONLY-- LET'S HEAR IT ALL AND DECLARE A NATIONAL WORRY WEEK. YOU WON'T BE OFFENDED? WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT, LULU? WELL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY CUSTOMERS LAST WEEK, AND YOU AREN'T GOING TO HAVE ANY NEXT WEEK OR EVER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THE WOMEN OF THIS TOWN HAVE AGREED NOT TO BUY ANY MORE HATS HERE. HOW DO YOU KNOW, LULU? MY AUNT TOLD ME LAST NIGHT. IT'S BECAUSE OF SOME GOSSIP. THANKS FOR LETTING ME KNOW. LOOKS AS THOUGH WE OUGHT TO GET READY FOR A BIG CLEARANCE SALE. I'M QUITE SURE THAT A NEXT-YEAR'S HAT WILL MAKE ALMOST ANYONE FORGET LAST YEAR'S GOSSIP. MAYBE SO, MISS WINTERS. ANYWAY, THE CHICAGO SHOP STILL LIKES MY HATS. OH, HERE COMES MADAME CLAIRE AND-- I'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM, LULU. [DOORBELL JINGLES] HOW DO YOU DO? HELLO, MISS WINTERS. WELL, I GOT BIGHEARTED AND THOUGHT I'D INVEST IN SOME NEW SCENERY FOR ROXIE AND LIZ. DO THE BEST YOU CAN FOR THESE DEBUTANTES. DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING SPECIAL IN MIND? IT'S UP TO THEM. THEY CAN'T GO FAR WRONG HERE. YOU KNOW, MISS WINTERS, YOU HAVE THE ONLY HATS IN TOWN THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE BLOOM ASCENSIONS. THANK YOU. DO ANY OF THESE MODELS APPEAL TO YOU? I WANT RED VELVET WITH WHITE FEATHERS. WHY DON'T YOU GET A SWORD, TOO? THEN YOU CAN JOIN A LODGE. PRETEND I DIDN'T COME IN WITH HER. I LIKE THIS ONE, MISS WINTERS. OH, I'M AFRAID IT WON'T SUIT YOU AT ALL, BUT TRY IT ON IF YOU LIKE. HERE'S THE MIRROR. WHAT DO YOU THINK, CLAIRE? I'LL TELL YOU WHEN WE GET UP IN SOME DARK ALLEY. LET MISS WINTERS DO THE PICKING. AFTER ALL, WE'RE NOT GOING TO A MASQUERADE BALL. Vergie: TRY THIS ONE. WELL, ISN'T THIS SOMETHING FOR THE EYES? HMM, I THINK I'LL GRAB THIS ONE ALL FOR MYSELF. WHAT'S THE TARIFF? I'M AFRAID THIS IS RATHER EXPENSIVE. I'VE GOT A STRONG CONSTITUTION. HOW BIG IS THE BLOW? 20. POUNDS STERLING? DOLLARS. SOLD! YOU KNOW, MISS WINTERS, WE PAY $40 IN OTHER STORES FOR A HAT ANYBODY ELSE COULD BUY FOR 20. NOT MANY LADIES ARE BUYING THEIR HATS HERE NOW. WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE AROUND HERE DON'T KNOW CLASS WHEN THEY SEE IT. MAY I TRY THIS ONE FOR YOU? YOU OUGHT TO GO TO A BIG TOWN AND GET SOME OF THAT MONEY WHILE THE MINT STILL MAKES IT. I DON'T NEED VERY MUCH MONEY. LIKE IT? [PIANO PLAYING] HELLO, MIKE. HELLO, SADIE. I THOUGHT YOU WAS IN CHICAGO. I WAS. JUST GOT BACK TODAY. SAY, IS BARRY PRESTON AROUND? I THINK SO. WHY? TELL HIM I WANT TO SEE HIM. SURE. HAVE A DRINK, SADIE? BETTER MAKE IT TWO. BARRY WILL NEED A STIFF ONE. OH, I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU. I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T LIGHT OUT OF THE FRONT WAY. WHY SHOULD I? I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY FROM YOU. DID A PRETTY GOOD IMITATION OF IT IN CHICAGO. WELL, I HAD TO COME HOME. BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE WITHOUT PAYING 3 MONTHS BACK RENT ON THE APARTMENT, DID YOU? I WAS GOING TO SEND IT TO YOU. BUT IN THE RUSH OF BUSINESS, IT SLIPPED YOUR MIND, I SUPPOSE. I HAVEN'T GOT IT. I'M BROKE. THAT'S TOO BAD, BECAUSE I'VE JUST GOT TO HAVE AN EVEN $500 BY TOMORROW NIGHT. DON'T BE FUNNY. MAYBE YOUR FATHER WON'T THINK I'M FUNNY. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. YOU STAY AWAY FROM MY FATHER! I AIN'T ANXIOUS TO SEE YOUR FATHER, BUT I GOT TO HAVE THAT MONEY, AND ONE OF YOU IS GOING TO GIVE IT TO ME. DRINK UP, KIDDO. IT WILL HELP YOU THINK. HOW MUCH DID SHE WANT? $500. I KNOW HOW YOU CAN FIX THAT. HOW? JUST DO A LITTLE FAVOR FOR ME. WHAT SORT OF FAVOR? THERE'S A CERTAIN PAPER I WANT THAT HAPPENS TO BE IN YOUR FATHER'S SAFE. IT DON'T MEAN NOTHING TO HIM, BUT IT WOULD BE WORTH $500 TO ME. WHAT IS IT? PAGE FROM A HOTEL REGISTER. IT'S GOT A SIGNATURE ON IT-- MRS. JOHN WOOD. WHO'S MRS. JOHN WOOD? THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. IT WAS MRS. WOOD'S BABY THE SHADWELLS ADOPTED. BUT I DON'T SEE WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH A HOTEL REGISTER. I JUST WANT TO COMPARE A LITTLE HANDWRITING, THAT'S ALL. HOW DO YOU KNOW MY FATHER HAS IT? BECAUSE HE BOUGHT IT OFF THE DOUBLE-CROSSER I HIRED TO GET IT FOR ME. I KNOW, BUT... MY FATHER AND JOHN SHADWELL ARE FRIENDS. LISTEN, KID, I CAN GET THE PROOF I WANT ANOTHER WAY. I'M JUST GIVING YOU A CHANCE TO MAKE THE DOUGH, THAT'S ALL. Preston: THROW UP YOUR HANDS. [GUNSHOTS] [WINDOW SHATTERS] LAWTON! LAWTON! BARRY! OH, BOY... WHAT'S HAPPENED, SIR? WHY, IT'S MR. BARRY! HE'S DEAD, LAWTON. SHOT BY A BURGLAR. MY SON TRIED TO STOP HIM. I SAW IT HAPPEN. HELLO, HERBIE! WHY, SADIE! HELLO, SADIE! CHRISTOPHER, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU! WHEN DID YOU GET IN? THIS AFTERNOON. YOU DID? DOGGONE IT, SADIE! WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER WRITE A FELLA? OH, I DON'T KNOW. I DIDN'T THINK YOU WANTED TO HEAR FROM ME, I GUESS. HEAR FROM YOU? GOSH, I THOUGHT WHEN YOU LEFT WE WERE PRACTICALLY ENGAGED! I THOUGHT YOU WERE ONLY KIDDING, HERBIE. YOU WERE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT "WHEN YOU GOT A RAISE." I WAS ALWAYS GOING TO KISS YOU WHEN-- WELL, I MEAN, WE WERE GOING TO BE ENGAGED WHEN I GOT A RAISE. DID YOU EVER GET IT? SURE, I DID. I'M EARNING PRETTY GOOD MONEY NOW. GEE, SADIE, YOU'RE JUST AS PRETTY AS YOU ALWAYS WERE. AND THOSE CITY CLOTHES... THEY'RE KIND OF LOUD, DON'T YOU THINK? BUT THEY'RE SWELL-- UP-TO-DATE. YOU'RE SWELL, KIDDO. YOU'RE KIND OF NICE YOURSELF, HERBIE. YOU DIDN'T GET ENGAGED TO ANY GUY IN CHICAGO, DID YOU? NO. THOSE CHICAGO GUYS AIN'T MY KIND. I'M JUST A SMALL-TOWN GIRL, I GUESS. MAYBE YOU'LL STAY HERE, THEN, AND BE... MRS. HERBERT SOMERBY. OH, GEE, HERBIE... ALL I CAME HOME FOR WAS TO SEE YOU. HONEST? HONEST. SAY, I'M THE LUCKIEST GUY IN THE WORLD! COME ON, LET'S TAKE A RIDE, HUH? YOURS? YES, AND IT'S ALL PAID FOR. COME ON, GET IN! THERE YOU ARE. NOW, LOOK, JUST HOLD THAT THING OVER THERE AND HOLD THAT DOWN THERE. THAT'S RIGHT. I'LL HAVE IT GOING IN A MINUTE NOW. IT'LL START! [DOORBELL JINGLES] CUTE LITTLE SHOP, ISN'T IT, FOR A SMALL TOWN. GEE, IT'S SWELL. GOOD AFTERNOON! HELLO, MISS WINTERS. A COUPLE OF FRIENDS OF MINE. BILLIE, ROSE... MISS WINTERS. HOW DO YOU DO? I'M FINE. SHE'S NOT WORRIED ABOUT YOUR HEALTH. I'M AWFUL GLAD TO KNOW YOU, MISS WINTERS. CLAIRE'S ALWAYS SAYING THE NICEST THINGS ABOUT YOU. THANK YOU. DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN. MOST PEOPLE I KNOW, I CAN DISMISS WITH A WORD. I WON'T USE THE WORD HERE. WE'VE HAD LOTS OF INTERESTING TALKS IN THIS ROOM, HAVEN'T WE? HOW MANY YEARS IS IT? OH, I'D HAVE TO THINK, AND THAT'S AGAINST MY PRINCIPLES. WELL, COUNTESS, WHAT HAVE YOUR PRECIOUS EYES LIGHTED UPON NOW? SAY, WOULDN'T MY MOTHER TURN OVER IN HER GRAVE IF SHE COULD SEE THIS... FROM ENVY, I MEAN. MY MOTHER WAS KLONDIKE CARRIE, AND DID SHE HATE OUTING FLANNEL! WHAT IS IT, CREPE DE CHINE? NO, IT'S NINON, AN IMPORTED MATERIAL. LIKE IT? YEAH! I THINK I DO. DON'T BE AFRAID TO CONVINCE YOURSELF. SHE'LL TAKE THAT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAKING A NEST FOR YOURSELF? OH, LOOK! WHO THOUGHT OF THAT? YOU? OH, NO. I READ ABOUT THEM IN A FRENCH MAGAZINE. I THOUGHT I'D MAKE SOME MYSELF. WELL, YOU GOT TO ADMIT NAPOLEON WASN'T THE ONLY CLEVER FRENCHMAN. BY THE WAY, MISS WINTERS, I HEARD YOU WERE HAVING MORE TROUBLE WITH THAT BIGHEARTED LANDLORD OF YOURS. YOU HEARD IT? SECRETS FLY FAST IN THIS TOWN. ESPECIALLY WITH YOUR LANDLORD-- JUST A CARRIER PIGEON AT HEART. HE RAISED MY RENT AGAIN, BUT FINALLY HE DECIDED I COULD STAY HERE ANOTHER YEAR... IF I PAID HIM A BONUS. I KNOW--HAS A HEART AS BIG AS A PEACH PIT. WELL, I'VE GOT SOME GREAT NEWS FOR YOU. AT LEAST, I HOPE IT WILL LIFT SOME OF THE LOAD YOU'VE BEEN CARRYING FOR YEARS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WELL, I MET THAT SWEET LANDLORD OF YOURS. NEVER MIND WHERE. AND-- [TELEPHONE RINGS] EXCUSE ME JUST A MOMENT, WILL YOU? SURE. TAKE YOUR TIME. I'LL WRAP UP THE DOODADS AND KEEP THE LADIES HONEST TILL YOU GET BACK. HELLO? OH! YES, DEAR-- WHAT'S THE MATTER, SWEET? CAN'T YOU TALK? NO! NO, NOT VERY WELL. THEN I'LL DO THE TALKING. ARE YOU SURPRISED? YES! I DIDN'T WRITE YOU WE WERE COMING BECAUSE I DECIDED SO SUDDENLY. MMM...IT'S GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE. I'LL CALL YOU LATER IN THE DAY, HMM? OH, YES, DEAR, PLEASE! GOOD-BYE. THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. I'M SORRY I KEPT YOU WAITING. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. WELL, I COUNTED IT ALL UP. IF THERE'S A MISTAKE, IT'S IN YOUR FAVOR. THANK YOU. WHAT WERE YOU TELLING ME ABOUT MY LANDLORD? IT CAN BE TOLD IN A FEW WORDS. I HAPPEN TO HAVE BOUGHT THIS PROPERTY. GOT THE DEED THIS MORNING... AND YOU'RE PAYING PLENTY OF RENT TO SUIT ME RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. IT'S ALL BEEN SAID. SO LONG. GOOD-BYE, AND THANKS! GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE. HMM! MADAME CLAIRE AND SOME OF HER EMPLOYEES. I GUESS THOSE ARE THE ONLY CUSTOMERS VERGIE WINTERS GETS ANYMORE. ISN'T THAT JOHN SHADWELL'S DAUGHTER, THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE? IT CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE HER. THEY MUST HAVE JUST GOT BACK FROM WASHINGTON. WHY DON'T YOU LOOK IN THE DRUGSTORE? YES. WOULDN'T YOUR MOTHER LIKE SOME PERFUME, JOAN? SHE'S GOT SO MANY KINDS, AND A BIRTHDAY PRESENT OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING SPECIAL THAT YOU HAVEN'T GOT ALREADY. WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK AND GET THAT BEADED BAG IN HORNBY'S? WELL, I'VE ONLY GOT $5.00. OH, LOOK! AREN'T THEY SCRUMPTIOUS? THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO GET HER! YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE! WHY NOT? NONE OF OUR MOTHERS BUY FROM VERGIE WINTERS. WHY? I DON'T KNOW, BUT MY MOTHER TOOK ME ACROSS THE STREET SO AS NOT TO PASS HER ON THE SIDEWALK. WELL, I DON'T CARE. I'M GOING TO BUY THAT FAN FOR MOTHER. COME ON. I'M GOING HOME. NO, WE'LL WAIT OUTSIDE. FRAID-CAT! [DOORBELL JINGLES] HOW DO YOU DO? ARE YOU MISS WINTERS? YES. I'M JOAN SHADWELL. I WANT TO BUY A PRESENT FOR MY MOTHER, AND I'VE ONLY GOT $5.00. COULD I BUY ONE OF THOSE FANS IN THE WINDOW FOR THAT? THE YELLOW ONE. OH, I CAN'T LET YOU-- DO YOU THINK SHE'D LIKE IT? I'VE BEEN TRYING TO THINK ALL DAY WHAT TO GIVE HER, AND THAT'S JUST PERFECT. BUT--BUT LADIES DON'T CARRY FANS LIKE THAT ANYMORE, DEAR. OR AT LEAST, IF THEY DO, IT'S ONLY FOR A COSTUME BALL OR SOMETHING. I'M AFRAID IT WOULDN'T DO. IT'S THE ONLY THING I'VE FOUND I REALLY WANTED. DOES IT COST TOO MUCH? HOW ABOUT A PRETTY EVENING BAG? I SAW SOME LOVELY ONES AT HORNBY'S. I SAW THEM, AND I'VE JUST GOT TO HAVE THAT YELLOW FAN. HOW MUCH IS IT, PLEASE? WELL, IF YOUR HEART IS SET ON IT... I WOULDN'T LIKE TO DISAPPOINT YOU. IT--IT'S $4.00. OH, THAT'S GRAND! I WAS SO AFRAID IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH. OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL! YOU'RE FOND OF YELLOW, AREN'T YOU? YES. IT'S MY FAVORITE COLOR. IS IT? I HAVE SOME RIBBON HERE THAT'S ALMOST THE SAME SHADE AS THE FAN. WOULD YOU... WOULD YOU LET ME GIVE YOU ENOUGH FOR YOUR HAIR? THAT'S AWFULLY NICE OF YOU. WILL YOU TAKE OFF YOUR HAT? SO I CAN MEASURE THE RIBBON. YELLOW IS VERY BECOMING TO YOU. THANK YOU. I'LL JUST PUT THEM IN A BAG FOR YOU. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE. [DOORBELL JINGLES] I DON'T SEE WHY HELEN AND RUTH SAID-- UH, GOOD-BYE. SHE WAS STANDING WITH HER BACK TO ME, LOOKING THROUGH THE CURTAIN AT THE THINGS IN THE WINDOW, AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT WAS TILL SHE TURNED AROUND. AND FROM THEN ON... I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS SAYING OR DOING. SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT ME VERY STUPID. JUST THE OPPOSITE. SHE SAID YOU WERE KIND AND LOVELY. IF I'D HAD MY WITS ABOUT ME, I-- OH, JOHN, SHE WASN'T SCOLDED OR ANYTHING? SHE CERTAINLY WAS NOT! OF COURSE, AFTER SHE WENT TO BED, THERE WAS A SLIGHT, SHALL WE SAY, AFTERMATH. OH, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY. THE FAN WAS DROPPED IN THE FIRE. THE INCIDENT IS CLOSED. I SEE. OH, BUT, VERGIE... HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY GO ON LIKE THIS? WHAT'S THE ANSWER TO ALL THIS SORROW AND THE WAITING? ONE ANSWER THROUGHOUT ALL THE AGES, JOHN: LOVE. I KNOW, DARLING, BUT IT ALL SEEMS SO UNFAIR-- THE WHOLE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN. MUST THIS HEARTACHE LAST THE REST OF OUR LIVES? I'VE QUIT WONDERING. ALL I KNOW IS THAT WE LOVE EACH OTHER. MY WORLD BEGINS AND ENDS RIGHT HERE. IT'S GOT TO END THERE. I CAN'T ACCEPT IT, VERGIE. THE 3 OF US BELONG TOGETHER, YOU AND JOAN AND I. 10 NIGHTMARE YEARS-- I CAN'T STAND IT ANY LONGER! I'VE GOT TO BE FREE! IT'S NO USE, JOHN. EVEN IF YOU WERE FREE, THE COURT MOST CERTAINLY WOULD AWARD JOAN TO HER. I'D COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN THAT. LITTLE JOAN, AWAY-- YOU SEE, DEAR, WE MUST ACCEPT THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE... AND BE GRATEFUL FOR THE HOURS. LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN, HMM? ANOTHER CLOSED INCIDENT. WELL, FRANK, THAT BOY OF YOURS CERTAINLY KNOWS HIS WAY AROUND UP THERE. HE SCARES ME STIFF. WHY, MR. TRUESDALE, RANNY'S THE BEST FLIER I KNOW. HE NEVER TAKES CHANCES. NEVER TAKES CHANCES! HE'S NEVER TAKEN ANYTHING ELSE SINCE HE WAS BORN. HELLO! Ranny: HI, JOAN. HELLO, DAD. HELLO, RANNY. ACTED PRETTY NICE, DIDN'T IT, MR. SHADWELL? IT SURE DID. ACTED LIKE AN INTOXICATED BEETLE, TO ME. COME ON, RANNY. DAD SAYS YOU CAN HAVE THE DAY OFF. OH, THANKS, MR. SHADWELL. I WISH YOU'D TRY OUT THAT NEW MARE BEFORE JOAN RIDES HER, WILL YOU? YES, SIR, I'D LIKE TO. COMING ALONG, DAD? I'VE GOT MY CAR. WELL, GOOD-BYE. BYE, MR. TRUESDALE. BYE, FATHER! GOOD-BYE! DON'T DRIVE TOO FAST, NOW! JOAN, DON'T YOU RIDE THAT MARE UNLESS RANNY SAYS SHE'S ALL RIGHT! I WON'T. I HOPE THOSE KIDS ARE REALLY AS FOND OF EACH OTHER AS THEY SEEM TO BE. THE WAY THEY FIGHT ALL THE TIME. GOOD MORNING, MISS WINTERS. WHY, GOOD MORNING, MR. TATE. HOW'S YOUR LITTLE GIRL? MAMIE'S MUCH BETTER. DR. DOLBY SAYS SHE'LL BE ALL WELL AGAIN SOON. THAT'S FINE! [HOOFBEATS APPROACHING] NICE HORSES, AIN'T THEY? THE YOUNG LADY RIDES BEAUTIFULLY, DOESN'T SHE? THAT'S JOHN SHADWELL'S GIRL. YES, I KNOW. MY, MY, THEY DO GROW UP FAST, DON'T THEY? DON'T SEEM LIKE NO TIME AT ALL SINCE RANNY TRUESDALE CAME TROTTING ALONG THAT PATH ON A LITTLE PONY. HMM. THEY MAKE A FINE-LOOKING PAIR. YES. GOOD-BYE, MR. TATE. OH, GOOD DAY, MISS WINTERS. GOOD MORNING. MORNING. GOT A MATCH? YES, I GUESS SO. DO YOU KNOW THAT LADY THAT JUST LEFT? SURE. I'VE KNOWN HER FOR YEARS. THAT'S VERGIE WINTERS. DOES SHE COME HERE OFTEN? NEARLY EVERY DAY. ABOUT THIS TIME? YES, NOW THAT I THINK OF IT. MISS SHADWELL USUALLY RIDES ABOUT THIS TIME, TOO, DOESN'T SHE? YES, EVERY MORNING. SAY, WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME ALL THESE QUESTIONS FOR? NO REASON. JUST CURIOUS. HAVE A CIGAR. THANKS. AND I'M CONVINCED, MRS. SHADWELL, THAT THIS VIRGINIA WOOD, WHO IS GIVEN HERE AS JOAN'S MOTHER, IS NONE OTHER THAN VERGIE WINTERS. BUT YOU HAVEN'T GOT ME ANY PROOF. THE INITIALS ARE THE SAME. AND WHY DOES VERGIE WINTERS GO TO THE PARK EVERY DAY TO SEE MISS JOAN RIDE BY? I'M PAYING YOU FOR ANSWERS, NOT QUESTIONS. AND I'LL HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS BEFORE LONG. HOW ARE YOU, MR. WINTERS? HOWDY. HOW'S MRS. WINTERS? ALL RIGHT. HMM! HERE'S YOUR DROPS. HOW MANY DID YOU PUT IN? I PUT IN JUST WHAT DR. DOLBY TOLD ME TO. YOU DON'T THINK I'M TRYING TO POISON YOU, DO YOU? I DON'T KNOW. I WANT TO PUT IN THEM DROPS MYSELF. THAT'S A NICE WAY TO TALK TO YOUR WIFE. YOU ACT LIKE YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO GET WELL. YOU DON'T. BUT I'LL FOOL YOU. I'LL LIVE 20 YEARS YET. ALL MY FOLKS ARE LONG-LIVERS. MY GRANDFATHER DIDN'T DIE UNTIL HE WAS 90, AND I AIN'T GOING, EITHER. HMM! HMM YOURSELF! WHAT FRENCH MATHEMATICIAN OF THE 17th CENTURY DEVELOPED A NEW SYSTEM OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH BEARS HIS NAME? ISN'T HE DISTINGUISHED, RANNY? THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I WAS LOOKING AT THE MODEL FOR FATHER'S STATUE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT? WELL, IT'S SOMETHING TO HAVE A MONUMENT PUT UP IN YOUR HOMETOWN BEFORE YOU'RE DEAD. I HOPE THEY PUT IT IN THE SQUARE AND NOT IN THE PARK. ALL RIGHT, NOW ASK ME ANOTHER QUESTION. WHEN WILL YOU MARRY ME? NOW, WAIT A MINUTE. THAT QUESTION'S NOT IN THE BOOK. NO, BUT I HAVE THE ANSWER. YOU'RE GOING TO ANKLE UP TO THE ALTAR THIS COMING MAY. AND WHAT IF MY HONORABLE PARENTS DON'T APPROVE OF THE DATE YOU'VE SET? WELL, THEY'LL HAVE AN OLD MAID ON THEIR HANDS. ALL RIGHT, WE'LL TELL THEM, THEN. COME ON! OH, HELLO! WELL, I SEE WE'VE ANNOUNCED JOAN'S ENGAGEMENT. YES. THEY WERE GOING TO PRINT IT IN THE KEYHOLE COLUMN, SO I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO ANNOUNCE IT. IT'S A NICE ARTICLE. JOHN, DON'T YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO TELL JOAN THAT SHE'S ADOPTED? WHY DO YOU SAY THAT? I DON'T EVER WANT HER TO KNOW. I CAN'T AGREE WITH YOU. I DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE FAIR NOT TO TELL. FAIR TO WHOM? TO JOAN AND TO RANNY. SUPPOSING HE FOUND OUT LATER? HE MIGHT FEEL HE'D BEEN DECEIVED. LAURA, I THOUGHT IT WAS ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD BETWEEN US THAT JOAN SHOULD NEVER KNOW. I THINK WE WERE WRONG. I FEEL AT LEAST RANNY SHOULD BE TOLD BEFORE THEY'RE MARRIED. I'M SORRY. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. YOU MEAN, YOU WON'T TELL THEM? NO. I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY. THEN I SHALL. LAURA, I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU. IT'S QUITE SIMPLE. I DON'T THINK RANNY SHOULD MARRY JOAN, BELIEVING THAT SHE'S OUR CHILD. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF BLOOD SHE HAS, NOR DO I. BUT I DO. OH, YOU DO? TELL ME ABOUT IT, JOHN. WHAT'S UP? NOTHING, NOTHING. COME IN, JOAN. COME IN, RANNY. NO, DON'T, RANNY. THE TIME IS NOT PROPITIOUS. I THINK WE'VE INTERRUPTED A FAMILY CONFERENCE. WAIT, JOAN! YOUR FATHER HAS SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU AND TO RANNY. LOOK, IF IT'S ABOUT THE FENDER ON MY CAR, DAD, THEY DID IT IN THE PARKING STATION. I STARTED TO PUT THE CAR UP, AND THE CHAUFFEUR BACKED RIGHT INTO ME. HONEST, HE DID, DAD. IT WASN'T MY FAULT. IT ISN'T ABOUT YOUR CAR, JOAN, IT'S ABOUT YOU. LAURA. VERY WELL, JOHN, YOU DO THE TELLING. WELL, THERE'S REALLY NOTHING TO TELL. YOUR MOTHER AND I WERE JUST HAVING A LITTLE JOKE. WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO RIDE WITH ME, YOUNG LADY? IT'S NOT A LITTLE JOKE, JOHN, AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL JOAN THAT SHE'S ADOPTED, I THINK I SHOULD. John: LAURA! ADOPTED?! JOAN, DARLING, I'M SORRY YOU WERE TOLD LIKE THIS, BUT MAYBE IT IS BETTER THAT YOU AND RANNY SHOULD KNOW. I NEVER INTENDED TO TELL YOU. NOT BECAUSE THERE'S ANYTHING FOR YOU TO FEEL BADLY ABOUT, SWEET, BUT JUST BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SELFISH ENOUGH TO WANT YOU ALWAYS TO THINK OF ME AS YOUR FATHER. YOU AREN'T MY FATHER? Laura: REALLY, THERE'S NO REASON FOR MAKING AN EMOTIONAL SCENE OF THIS. John: LAURA, PLEASE! DARLING, WE ADOPTED YOU WHEN YOU WERE A TINY, WEENSY, LITTLE BABY... BUT YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN LOVED MORE IF YOU'D BEEN MY OWN. WHO ARE MY FATHER AND MOTHER? I KNEW YOUR FATHER VERY WELL. HE WAS FORCED INTO THE POSITION OF GIVING YOU TO ME. HE DID IT FOR YOUR BEST GOOD. AND MY MOTHER? Laura: GO ON, JOHN. TELL THE CHILD ABOUT HER MOTHER. YOUR MOTHER WAS A VERY BRAVE, FINE, UNSELFISH WOMAN. IN GIVING YOU UP, SHE THOUGHT ONLY OF YOU, SWEET. YOU MEAN, THEY WERE VERY POOR? YES. WHERE ARE THEY? ARE THEY LIVING? YES, THEY ARE. BUT IT'S THEIR WISH AND MINE... THAT YOU FORGET THEM. WELL, RANNY, DOES ANY OF THIS MATTER TO YOU? YOU MEAN, DO I FEEL ANY DIFFERENTLY ABOUT JOAN? GOOD HEAVENS, NO! WHY SHOULD I? WHAT DIFFERENCE COULD IT POSSIBLY MAKE? THAT'S RIGHT. I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT. PERHAPS I OUGHT TO BREAK OUR ENGAGEMENT, RANNY. GIVE ME BACK MY RING. HERE IT IS, MR. TRUESDALE. THANK YOU. NOW, HOLD UP YOUR HAND. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT I KNOW YOU'RE A FOUNDLING OR SOMETHING... AND I'M CONDONING IT. NOW, WILL YOU PLEASE MAKE UP YOUR MIND AND TELL ME WHEN WE'RE GOING TO GET MARRIED? NOT VERY ROMANTIC, BUT MOST BUSINESSLIKE. WHEN SHALL I SAY, MOTHER? THIS COMING MAY? WHENEVER YOU LIKE, DEAR. I THINK IT'S VERY FINE OF RANNY TO TAKE ALL THIS THE WAY HE HAS. I THINK IT SHOWS HE'S GOT DARN GOOD SENSE. SOME YOUNG MEN MIGHT OBJECT. THAT'S A LOT OF BALONEY, MRS. SHADWELL... IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME. WHAT DO I CARE WHO JOAN'S FATHER AND MOTHER WERE? I'LL BET THEY WERE A SWELL PAIR IF THEY WERE ANYTHING LIKE JOAN. THANKS, RANNY. YOU'RE A DOLL! COME ALONG, HONEY. LET'S GO OUTSIDE AND SEE WHAT MAKES THE STARS COME OUT. I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS, LAURA. THAT'S ONE THING YOU COULD HAVE SPARED HER. THERE YOU ARE, ALL FIXED. OH, JOHN, YOU HAVE SOME PIECES LEFT OVER. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'LL RUN JUST THE SAME. NOW WE'LL BE ABLE TO HEAR THAT SYMPHONY TOMORROW. I'M SORRY WE MISSED IT TONIGHT. SO AM I. I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THAT BRAHMS. MM-HMM. HOW'S JOAN'S ANKLE? OH, NOTHING SERIOUS. SHE'S OUT DANCING TONIGHT. I'M GLAD SHE AND RANNY LIKE THE SAME THINGS. HE'S A FINE BOY. [MUSIC PLAYING] I KIND OF LIKE THAT. HOW ABOUT YOU? MMM, FINE. THANKS FOR FIXING IT. ANY MORE JOBS FOR A HANDYMAN? YOU MIGHT COME OVER IN THE MORNING AND HELP ME HANG THE NEW CURTAINS IN THE SHOP. IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE MAKING? OH, JOHN, THIS? FOR A CURTAIN? WHY, IT'S REAL OLD DUCHESS LACE. WHAT IS IT FOR, THEN? A WEDDING VEIL. IT IS PRETTY. IT BELONGED TO MY GRANDMOTHER. JOAN'S WEDDING MADE ME THINK OF IT. LOCKED AWAY FOR SO LONG... LIKE A MEMORY, CRADLED WITH LAVENDER. I WONDERED HOW IT WOULD LOOK ON JOAN. IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL THING. I SUDDENLY FOUND MYSELF MAKING IT OVER, BRINGING IT UP-TO-DATE, AS THOUGH SHE WERE REALLY GOING TO WEAR IT. I SUPPOSE THAT SOUNDS SILLY TO YOU, JOHN, BUT IT'S LIKE SO MANY ADVENTURES I HAVE ALL TO MYSELF. YOU'VE NO IDEA. WHENEVER YOU GO AWAY, I NEVER FEEL ALONE. I DON'T SEEM TO NEED PEOPLE. YOU ALWAYS LET ME KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING, AND I FOLLOW YOU... ON MAPS, IN YOUR LETTERS, READ OVER AND OVER SO MANY TIMES... IN NEWSPAPERS, THOUGH ALL THE HEADLINES ARE SO DEAD AND MEANINGLESS UNTIL I SEE YOUR NAME. I CAN BE WITH YOU EVERYWHERE... WITHOUT EVER LEAVING THIS ROOM. AND IT'S ALL SO REAL. A WORLD OF MY OWN, A DREAMWORLD SO COMPLETE, SO TOLERANT AND FINE... THAT I'VE COME TO CHERISH THE DREAM. I WANT NOTHING MORE THAN THAT, EVER. JOHN, DARLING, I SOMETIMES WONDER IF YOU REALIZE HOW RICH YOU'VE MADE MY LIFE, HOW FAR YOU'VE PLACED ME BEYOND ANY HURT THE WORLD OUTSIDE CAN GIVE. THAT'S WHAT I MEANT ABOUT THE VEIL, JOHN. I'VE SEEN HER IN IT. I WANT TO SEE HER IN IT, TOO. WILL YOU LET HER REALLY WEAR IT FOR ME? WHY, YES, IF YOU LIKE. I'LL PUT IT ON SO YOU CAN SEE HOW IT LOOKS. NO, VERGIE, DON'T! DON'T PUT IT ON. DARLING! VERGIE, I WANT YOU TO BE THERE. LET ME HAVE THE WEDDING IN CHURCH SO YOU CAN COME. NO, JOHN. I'LL BE THERE... ANYWAY. [CHIMING] JUST PUT THEM IN THE BACK OF THE CAR, THOMAS. VERY GOOD, SIR. LAURA, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. I'M FRIGHTFULLY TIRED, JOHN. GETTING A WEDDING OUT OF THE HOUSE ISN'T ANY EASY MATTER. BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT. I MUST SPEAK WITH YOU. I SUPPOSE IT'S ABOUT JOAN. YOU'VE NEVER FORGIVEN ME FOR TELLING HER THAT SHE WAS ADOPTED, HAVE YOU? NO. BUT THIS IS MORE SERIOUS. LAURA, I WANT YOU TO DIVORCE ME. WHY, JOHN, ARE YOU DEVELOPING A SENSE OF HUMOR? THE IDEA ISN'T NEW TO ME, LAURA. YOU, TOO, NO DOUBT, HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT OFTEN DURING THE PAST 20 YEARS. IF I HAVE, I ASSURE YOU IT WASN'T A SERIOUS THOUGHT. THERE'S NO LONGER ANY REASON WHY WE SHOULD GO ON PRETENDING TO BE MARRIED. I PRESUME, AS IS USUAL IN SUCH CASES, THERE IS ANOTHER WOMAN? YES. THERE HAS BEEN FOR YEARS. AND YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HER? I ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. IT'S TOO BAD YOU DIDN'T MARRY HER. IT SEEMS A LITTLE LATE TO RECTIFY THAT SMALL LEGAL DIFFICULTY. I WANT YOU TO BE FAIR, LAURA. YOU CAN ARRANGE MATTERS TO SUIT YOURSELF. SUPPOSING I REFUSE TO DIVORCE YOU? THEN I SHALL BE FORCED TO DIVORCE YOU. SO THAT YOU CAN MARRY HER, I TAKE IT. YES. MY DEAR JOHN, DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL ACCEPT HER? WHAT ABOUT YOUR CAREER? WHEN JOAN WENT OUT OF THIS HOUSE TODAY, MY CAREER WENT WITH HER. I NO LONGER CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY OR THINK. NOT EVEN IF YOU MARRY JOAN'S MOTHER? I KNOW WHO SHE IS. I'VE KNOWN ABOUT YOUR AFFAIR FOR YEARS. I DIDN'T CARE SO LONG AS IT DIDN'T TOUCH ME, BUT NOW YOU'RE BRINGING IT IN MY HOME, AND I WON'T HAVE IT! FOR 20 YEARS, I'VE BEEN MRS. JOHN SHADWELL, AND I'M NOT GOING TO STAND IDLY BY AND SEE MY PLACE AND POSITION TAKEN BY ANOTHER WOMAN! SHARING YOU IS ONE THING, BUT GIVING YOU UP IS ANOTHER, AND I WON'T DO IT! YOU'LL HAVE TO, LAURA. I SHALL HAVE JUDGE GILLESPIE CALL ON YOU AND ARRANGE EVERYTHING. [DOORBELL JINGLES] [DOORBELL JINGLES] JOHN! WHY ARE YOU COMING IN THIS WAY? HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND? NO. I'M COMING IN THE FRONT DOOR FROM NOW ON. WHAT ON EARTH HAS HAPPENED TO YOU? I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU SO EXCITED! WELL, THE BIG CRISIS HAS FINALLY COME. CRISIS? YES. I'VE TOLD LAURA. YOU TOLD HER WHAT? I TOLD HER I WAS THROUGH. I'VE ASKED HER FOR A DIVORCE. OH, JOHN! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! NEITHER CAN I, BUT IT'S TRUE. I'M LEAVING TONIGHT FOR WASHINGTON TO CLEAR UP MY AFFAIRS. WE'RE GOING TO BE FREE, VERGIE. AREN'T YOU HAPPY? I DON'T KNOW. I WANT TO BE, BUT... SOMEHOW, IT ALL SEEMS SO UNBELIEVABLE... AFTER 20 YEARS. AS SOON AS IT'S OVER, DARLING, WE'LL BE MARRIED. OH, JOHN... [DOORBELL JINGLES] NOW, WHO IN THE WORLD... LAURA! I WANTED TO MEET THE WOMAN WHO PROPOSES TO TAKE MY PLACE. AND HAVING MET HER, I'M NOT AT ALL IMPRESSED. JOHN, I'M GIVING YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE YOUR MIND. I TOLD YOU, LAURA, WHAT I INTEND TO DO. THAT'S FINAL. YOU'LL NEVER MARRY-- [GUNSHOTS] JOHN... JOHN! JOHN.. JOHN! NO! YOU SAY YOU FIRST SAW THE MAN LOOKING IN YOUR WINDOW. YES. AND HE WAS SOMEONE YOU'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE? YES. AND THEN HE CAME THROUGH THE BACK DOOR AND SHOT SENATOR SHADWELL. THAT'S RIGHT. THEN HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT WE FOUND THE BACK DOOR LOCKED FROM THE INSIDE? I DON'T KNOW. PLEASE DON'T ASK ME ANY MORE QUESTIONS. WE'D LIKE TO OBLIGE YOU, MISS WINTERS, BUT WE ARE HIRED TO FIGURE THESE THINGS OUT. YOUR STORY DON'T JIBE WITH THE FACTS, AND THE GUN'S GOT YOUR FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER IT LIKE SCARLET FEVER. I'M AFRAID WE GOT TO TAKE YOU ALONG WITH US. [FUNERAL DIRGE PLAYING] HE WAS SWELL TO WORK FOR. I GUESS HE WAS ALL RIGHT, AT THAT. THERE'S THE HONORABLE LLEWELLYN PRESTON. REMEMBER HIS SON BARRY? WHAT MADE YOU THINK OF HIM? HE WAS SHOT, TOO. NO CONNECTION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE ME THINK OF HIM. THE ONLY MAN IN TOWN I EVER HAD ANY RESPECT FOR. I WONDER WHO HE REMEMBERED IN HIS WILL? I HOPE HE LEFT THE HOSPITAL SOME MONEY. I WONDER WHO REALLY KILLED HIM. I DID... 22 YEARS AGO... WHEN I LIED TO HIM. [SOBBING] RANNY, SHE'S BEEN IN THIS TERRIBLE PLACE A WHOLE YEAR. DON'T THINK ABOUT IT, SWEET. THIS WAY, DEAR. HERE ARE SOME FRIENDS TO SEE YOU. MISS WINTERS, I'M RANNY TRUESDALE. OH, YES. HOW DO YOU DO? AND THIS IS... MRS. TRUESDALE. I REMEMBER SO WELL THE DAY THAT YOU WERE MARRIED. IT'S VERY KIND OF YOU TO COME AND SEE ME. WE'VE COME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PARDONED YOU. ,, PARDONED?AS PARDONED YOU. YES. AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU HOME... WITH US. I, UH... I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT. MISS WINTERS, MRS. SHADWELL DIED LAST WEEK. JUST BEFORE IT HAPPENED, SHE TOLD JOAN AND ME EVERYTHING. WE'VE BEEN TO SEE THE GOVERNOR. IT'S ALL ARRANGED. AND YOU'RE COMING WITH US...TODAY. I--I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU SHOULD BE SO KIND TO ME, BUT I'M VERY, VERY GRATEFUL. DO I...JUST GET MY HAT AND COAT? YES, DEAR. WILL YOU EXCUSE ME, PLEASE? STILL PROTECTING ME. SHE DOESN'T WANT ME TO KNOW THAT... SHE'S MY MOTHER. AND I WANTED SO TO PUT MY ARMS AROUND HER. YOU CAN, DEAR... WHEN WE GET HER HOME.
