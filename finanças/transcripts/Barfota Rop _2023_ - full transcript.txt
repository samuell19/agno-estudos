Sweden in 1840 When Sweden was in the darkest hours, Messengers of hope began to cry out. When I was a child it was a difficult time in many ways. It was forbidden to gather to pray and read the Bible unless a clergyman was present. I could not imagine then what our prayers would lead to. It's the Constable and the Parish Clerk! We have to hide! Oh no! We have to hide! Here maybe. Did you hear? Oh no, not the Bible! I have to do something. After her! The Barefoot Messengers Three months earlier Ophelia Here is the way! A film by Barfota Productions Maria Viklund, Simon Frisk, Tomas Andersson After an idea by Maria, Lova and Elivia Viklund Script - A group of children under the direction of Maria Viklund Good morning Ophelia! Good morning! Mother, I had such a peculiar dream last night. The people in our parish are turning away from God's good way. Those who drink brandy turn it into an idol. The vicars just want us to learn the catechism by heart ...but I'm sure that... God much rather wants us to understand the love Jesus showed when he sacrificed himself for us on the cross. Mother, they don't just drink. They lie, steal and beat each other. Look at your own hand, so many bruises you have! Shame on you girl! Do not speak like that... neither about the vicar nor your Father. They are doing the best they can. But mother, it would be good for us if we were doing God's will. Yes that's true. I had a dream about grandma last night. Where is her Bible? I think it's in the cupboard over there. You can look for yourself. Mother, can I read in Grandma's Bible? If you are careful about it, it will be fine. It warms my heart when I think about grandma. Ophelia, this is the Word of God. You have to learn to read God's word. It gives you strength and help. I believe God has a special plan for your life. Always stay close to him! He will give you strength to be able to perform mighty things. Here is a word of God. This memory verse you must save and keep carefully. You will need it in the future. "Whether you turn to the right or to the left, let your ears hear this word behind you: Here is the way, walk on it!" Mother, God has spoken to me in a dream and now through the Bible. You remind me so much of grandma. (noise and noise) Where are the money? You got paid by Lindqvist yesterday. Bring the money! I must have them to buy potatoes and oats. I have a debt to pay! Give me the money! You know how the drought has hit hard. We barely have any food on the table You have to pay for your own drinking. Shut up woman! Hi Ophelia! Hello Marta! I had a peculiar dream last night. I think it was God who gave me the dream. Tell me more! The people were lost, they didn't find the right way. But then they began to follow a great light. We all followed that light. I think it was God's light! I think God is calling me. He calls us to show the people the right way. Ophelia, when I prayed last night God spoke to my heart that he wants to use us young people to do something great. How amazing, it must be God! Where did Elsa go? It's dangerous here by the water. We have to look for her! Elsa! Elsa! Elsa! Maybe she's in the barn? Elsa! Elsa! Here you are! You have no idea how worried we have been for you. What has happened? Oh, how cute they are! Marta, Ingrid, Selma! I have found Elsa! They are absolutely fantastic! Hello, little friend! Ophelia, this could be a good meeting place. What do you mean? If you borrow your grandmother's Bible, we can meet here after school tomorrow. Yes, what a great idea! It is dangerous if people gather illegally to read the Bible and talk about holy things. It is forbidden to do so without a clergyman leading the gathering. If common people take such initiatives, we don't know how it ends. The Church is united and must be united. There is something called "the Conventicle Act". It is a law from the King which prohibits such gatherings. I want Mr. Grundström to be alert to this danger. Swing the rope! Get started then! (school bell rings) Welcome to a new day in school! Today the sun is shining so beautifully. In the same way God wants to shine with his light upon you. Let's sing "Again, Thy glorious sun doth rise" "Again, Thy glorious sun doth rise I praise Thee my Lord With courage, strength and hope renewed I touch the joyful chord" Have a seat! We start with the Swedish lesson! See you in the barn this afternoon! How exciting, can you bring the Bible then? Sure! Why do you look so secretive? We will gather in Lindqvist's barn, do you want to join? God has spoken to me that he wants to use us young people to do something great. That sounds exciting! I'll come along. (bubbling sound) Isn't great that you can make your own spirits. Here Constable, taste it, go ahead! Maybe, you should add some cumin? Well, I think it is better to use anise. Listen! The vicar has reminded me of the Conventicle Act. We must keep a watchful eye on the risk of illegal gatherings. Such gatherings can lead to division here in our parish. Is that clear? I had a peculiar dream last night. God spoke to me through the dream. People in our parish are going astray. They have left God's good way. See how they get drunk. God wants to intervene and help us. We must pray! What if someone finds us, then we will be beaten. Dad, says it's forbidden to read the Bible and sing praises. Why? There is a law that says that only the Vicar can explain the Bible. Folke, will you keep watch out of the window, please? Sure, there may be a law, but we must obey God. He will help us and be with us. Let me read to you from the Bible. "Whether you turn to the right or left, let your ears hear this behind you: Here is the way. Walk on it" I feel like a fire is burning inside me. I want to cry out to the people that they should repent and walk on the right path! I feel the same, it's like a fire which is lit in me. We must pray together! God, come and break in. Help the people! God, you must help the people. Let them meet you! Help them to follow your path! "The Lord is faithful in everything he says and loving in all his deeds." You have all worked well today. I am so happy to be your teacher. For tomorrow, you have to learn the four types of grain. Does anyone know them? Tage Rye... Oats... Wheat... Semolina (laugh) Beatrice Barley By tomorrow, you need to know the four grains, thank you for today! Thank you for today! Let's play a game! Yes! How fun it was to gather in our barn! What if we could do it tonight again? Then I will come. What if someone exposes us? We have to pray that God protects us. Ophelia do you bring the Bible with you? I hope that no one will see it. You need to hide it somehow. I'll try. Oh, how fun to meet together in the barn. Did anyone see you? No I do not think so. Did you bring the Bible? I hid it in the laundry basket. I love listening to the Bible! "The hope does not fail, for the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit" What does it mean? It means that God has put something in our hearts, that no one can take away from us. That is our Hope. Can we sing a song? "We know that God in every way, helps those who love him to reach the good, those whom he has called according to his plan..." Cheers to that! Yes, cheers to that! Ophelia and the children have gathered. They pray and sing praises together. What do you say child? Come here! They pray and read from the Bible. Without a Vicar? That's against the law! It is against the Conventicle Act. It's terrible! When did this happen? Now! Now? It is unbelievable! Mr. Grundström, now we have to calm down a bit. We will deal with this. We need to go to the Vicar. Let's go! Yes we do! It's the Constable and the Parish Clerk, we have to hide! Oh no! We have to hide! Did you hear? Oh, no, not the Bible! I have to do something. After her! Ophelia! Poor deluded child! You know that it is forbidden to gather on your own to read the Bible? It is against the law, against the Conventicle Act! Here before God one must speak the truth. What right does Ophelia have to read aloud from the Scripture and speak of holy things? I am a witness, who cannot keep silent about what God has done. Is Ophelia more holy than other people here in the neighborhood? I need God's forgiveness and help just as much as anyone else. Why then do you gather in an illegal way? We want to follow Jesus and listen to him. Where can you meet Jesus? You can meet him in the Bible and in the Holy Communion which the Mr. Nordin our Vicar administers. And where two or three are gathered in the Lord's name, he's in our midst. Does Ophelia defend illegal gatherings by using the words of Jesus? Peter says that we shall obey God more than people. Ophelia is cheeky and rebellious! You are only a child and in addition to that a girl. What does Paul write about the authorities? That every person must obey the authority. That is right and if Ophelia doesn't quit with illegal gatherings she will get a punishment. Is this understood? Yes, Mr. Vicar. (door opens) My little Ophelia, how gloomy you look! Come and have a drink, it always cheers you up! Sit down here! No, I don't want that! Don't you understand that it is completely wrong! Why are you sad Ophelia? They forbid us to read from the Bible and pray together. And it's the only thing that gives us hope and strength. Look Ophelia, a note! It's grandma's memory vers! Shall I read? "I am with you always until the end of time" Jesus is with us, then we are not alone! Thank you Elsa! Jesus is with us! Why can't we read the Bible and sing praises together? I like when we do that. The vicar thinks it is dangerous, but that is not true. We do better when we read the Word of God. Ophelia! What happened? The constable forced me to go home. The vicar forced me to answer a lot of questions. If we break the law we will get a penalty. We must keep on preaching, God's word must continue to flow! We have nowhere to gather now. If they find us in the barn, they will punish us. Can we go to Selma? Yes we do! Hey! Why do you look so sad? We have nowhere to gather. We can be in our little cottage. Mother is very ill, but she needs to be cheered up. (wood is split) Don't just stand there, get more wood! We need to mend the fence. Hello Arvid? How is mother doing? I have not got any contacted with her for several hours. She doesn't have much time left. Let's go in and make some food for her. Mother I'm home! Hi Mother, it's me. She doesn't answers. Ingrid get a cloth, please! Thanks. I can't get in touch with her. Can we pray for her? I read from the Bible God is light, there is no darkness in him. Dear God, heal Mother Anna! We know that you can heal her. Amen (singing) Lord lift up and strengthen the weak ones Lord touch this body... Mother are you awake? So many people in the cabin! You look like angels! Dear children, what is happening? God has healed you! It was as I was in heaven... I heard lovely words and angels who sang! Were you singing? Have you prayed for me? God has heard you, he has answered your prayer! He has made me well! Dear children... keep speaking the sweet words from God! Arvid! Everything will be fine now. (people talking) Anna, weren't you seriously ill? Yes, I was. But now you are healthy? As you can see with your own eyes! Dear Anna, is it true that God has touched you? It was the children who prayed! We must listen to the children God works through them! Amazing, it's God who has helped you! It's true. I have heard the rumours. Are you really healed? You can see it by yourself! You have come here today because you have heard that God has healed mother Anna but God wants you to seek Him with all your hearts! Then he will help you! Search for him and ask for him! (singing) "Tell me the way that leads to the life which was once chosen by God Dear soul I advice you answers Jesus! Come to me!" Agatha... I am thinking about what the Vicar said. He wants us to keep an eye on the teacher. Miss Lovisa? So that she doesn't encourage the child preachers. They can take some liberties. If we don't intervene this may lead to a danger for the whole parish and for your office. Beatrice! Yes Mother. What does Beatrice think about Miss Lovisa? She is kind, but not very strict. Interesting... What does Beatrice mean then? She has never sent anyone to the corner of shame. Has she not? More? She has never hit anyone's fingers with the stylus. What does Beatrice say? More? She has never slammed any bench top on the fingers. Has she not? Let me take care of this. Yes, that will be the best solution. Good morning! Good morning Miss Lovisa! Do you know that Ophelia and Märta have illegal gatherings? It was I who told the constable. Beatrice must know that reading the Word of God has never been harmful to anyone. Now go and take your place! Good morning! Today we will start by reading a verse from the Bible. Beatrice, can you please read in Matthew 19 verse 14. "Then Jesus said, Let the children come to me and do not hinder them for the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them." God loves the little ones! He does not turn away those who come to him. Have a seat, please! We start with reading aloud. Sorry Mrs. Grundström! (knocks) I'm sorry to interrupt. No problems. How is my Beatrice doing? She behaves well, Beatrice is doing well. I'm glad to hear that! Do you know that you have Repentance Criers in the class? I don't want my Beatrice to be defiled by them. Surely you keep a watchful eye on them? Miss Lovisa should know that it is good for children with spanking. I definitely know how to deal with children. I really hope so! Otherwise, the school board can easily find a more suitable teacher. Goodbye! Oh, God's little saint comes by. Do you have a word of God to share? We will find you wherever you hide. Do you think you can stop what God wants to do? When you barricade doors God will always open new ones. Come Ophelia! How fun it will be with the meeting in the forest today. We will cry out! It will be a good opportunity for our parish to hear the word of God. There were a lot of people in the cottage of mother Anna. Did you see the people outside who looked through the window? It has never happened before! The worst would probably be if the Vicar would come by. (singing) You came down to a sinful world and suffered and died for us. Our rebellion and our pride became your torment on a cross. We bow here before you when we realize our need" Let everyone praise God! God does not want you to oppress those who trust in him! Help them instead to follow him! Repent from folly and the ways of destruction! Live in righteousness! Lift your eyes to God in all his glory and neglect no more your duties! We in our generation are the future and if you do not raise us up well what can then prevent the future from becoming even more deplorable? Turn to Jesus and cry out to Him for help! He is the only one who can save and deliver! Wake up, you are lost without him! God wants us to help each other! He wants to teach us about love. God loves you! Turn back to him! He has good plans for your life. God has spoken to me, that we should live more according to his will. He wants us to stop drinking. It just brings us further and further away from his good path. It becomes like an idol. We have to stop! It may feel impossible, but we would all feel better if we could make a change. God wants to help us! It is wrong that the Parish Clerk and the Vicar drinks. Don't look up to them! God will help them when the time is right. God wants to help us for the best of everyone! Don't you see how your wives and children suffer from drinking? God wants to help you! There is hope! (singing) "You came down to a sinful world and suffered and died for us. Our rebellion and our pride became your torment on a cross. We bow here before you when we realize our need and beg for your forgiveness and new life in your death. Forgive us and have mercy, we are lost on our own Only you can set us free from the burden of guilt and the bonds of sin" So, that's all for today Tomorrow we will have a visit from Dean Wilson who comes to our parish on visitation as he does every year. The Dean himself has wished to see our school. My Father says that Dean Wilson is a real clergyman. What does that mean? I think it means that he'd rather preaches the word of God than he plays cards. Ahaah! Hello! There is something I must tell you. What is it Miss Lovisa? The school board has decided that I'm not allowed to teach any longer. Why? They consider that I have taken the side of the repentance criers. There is a new law, which they use against me. No! How terrible! You know how difficult it is for us. We can't do it without you. God has not promised that it will always be easy but he has promised to be with us always until the end of time. Always with us. Will we meet again? My sister Lina is coming tomorrow with her fiance to picks me up at the square. It would be nice if you could meet them. Come and meet us there! And then we'll say goodbye. Yes please. Nordin! What a joy to see you again! Dean Wilson! Welcome to the end of the world. I hope the trip was pleasant! Very pleasant, Nordin. But the end of the world? Have I really traveled that far? This is the small world. Does the Dean have anything to tell from the big world? Yes, I have... I recently listened to the parish rector Peter Wieselgren's lecture over the merits of sobriety. Very interesting! Wieselgren, the sobriety advocate? He who wants to ban brandy? Dean Wilson can't be serious. Should we really listen to him? I've heard both one thing and another about Wieselgren, but when you listen to himself then you see things in a different light. So many good things have taken place in his parish. When people are sober, they work, take care of their families. Even the economy is booming! The psalmist David writes "The weak are oppressed, the poor complain Now I intervene says the Lord I want to give salvation to them who yearn for it" During my days here I have been amazed over and over again. God is doing something great here. I have met one after another who have experienced a deep conversion. Here I have a list of fifty men who have decided to both quit making and drinking brandy. It seems like the Lord has used the local repentance criers. The atmosphere here is now more friendly and peaceful. Many slumbering souls have awakened! Let us thank God that He intervenes and saves those who long for salvation! (organ music) "Again, Thy glorious sun doth rise, I praise Thee my Lord With courage, strength and hope renewed I touch the joyful chord" Well! That did not sound good! Good morning! Good morning Mrs. Grundström! The school board in the parish has decided that when we now got a new school law it requires a better educated person to be the teacher here in the parish. That is why Miss Lovisa had to quit and I will replace her. So now you call me Miss Grundström. Is that clear? Yes, Miss Grundström. Sit down please! From what I understand, Miss Lovisa has trained you in the royal history you in historical knowledge of the Swedish Kingdom. It is appropriate then that I begin with an examination this first day. I will ask you three questions: What is the name of the first King of Sweden? Yes, Per! Gustav Vasa, Miss Grundström. Well done Per, sit down please! Is there any female regent on the throne in Sweden? Yes, Karl Queen Kristina, Miss Grundström. That was correct, please sit down Karl! When did Karl XII die? Ingrid Uh...uh In the final battle. Folke, in my classes we don't whisper. Go straight to the corner of shame! But he didn't do anything! Ophelia, raise your hand if you want to say something! Go ahead and join your brother! Hurry up, into the corner of shame! That is the right place for the two of you to repent and cry! Well, when did Karl XII die? Beatrice? In the 30th of November 1718. Correct Beatrice, Please sit down! Lovisa, Lovisa! How good that you could come! I was worried that we wouldn't have time to say goodbye. This is my sister Lina and her fiancé Olof Hedengren. Good afternoon. Good afternoon Ophelia! Lovisa has told me that you are a brave young woman and that you have contributed to the moral awakening in this parish. I am deeply touched by what I've heard of what you have done. I work with politics and school issues. I am grateful for what you have done for the people here in the parish of Berga. You have endured a lot! Where did you find your courage? It is God who gives me courage. I can't keep quiet when I see how people walk astray, far away from the good way of God. I simply must cry out for a change. When I prayed for Miss Wigert, I received a word from the Bible. Thank you, a word for me? It is time to travel for us. May the Lord bless you in the work you do! Ophelia, I have to leave now. May God protect you and bless you! I will pray for you. Thank you Miss Lovisa, I will miss you. Goodbye! God is good, repent and walk on the good way of God! (applause) The Word of God flows through our generation, so why are we neglected? Jesus is Lord! Let nothing else control you! Jesus is Lord! Repent! Do you not understand that you have sinned against the living God! Turn back to the way of God! God can help you with everything you ask for, if you learn to listen to him! We are young and unlettered, but after uscomes men of God who will raise up the church in our country! What is going on here? Who is responsible for this crowd? It's Ophelia, she talked about it in the school. Ophelia, you've made enough of mess now. Come with me now! Don't touch the children, they have spoken words from God here today! Here are many who have made holy decisions today! We don't want people like you here, go home! And how do you think the drinking will stop, if you attack the children? You are a big chatterbox who doesn't care about neither of law nor order Come along! You are arrested! Yes, it will be fine. That's good Nilsson! From now on, this meeting is closed. Everyone goes home! Is that clear? Ophelia, you and I must to the Parish Clerk. You need a lesson in religion. (footstep) Well, you've been caught red handed. You have been on an illegal gathering and been crying for repentence. You have been affected by the preaching disease. You have eaten bad seed. There is medicine for this. Take one spoonful a day of this medicine, then you will be cured from the preaching disease. Is that clear? Yes, Mr. Grundström. Good morning, do you have a scythe left for me? Yes, I still have a scythe left, but you'll get paid in brandy. If you want money go somewhere else, I pay in brandy! (knock) Hello! What does he want? Do you have a simple job? You can cut some hay, for a drink or two. No, drink. Good morning Dad! How did it go? Do you not worry about it. It went as bad as usual. I don't get any job. I'm only offered to get paid in brandy. Take your medicine now as the Parish Clerk has prescribed. Goodbye Mrs Lindqvist! Good afternoon, Doctor! Good afternoon, girls! How is mother doing? I'm Sorry, I don't think your Mother has so much time left to live? What can we do? Let us go in to your Mother! Goodbye! Mother! Ophelia is that you? I heard you have had such a hard time. How are you? I'm doing fine, but what about you? I have been so worried for you. It's not good with me. The doctor has been here and he says that there is nothing more to do. There is always something more we can do. We must pray to God. God, heal Mrs Lindqvist! Help her from this severe disease! You are the only one who can do something right now. Amen Thanks Ophelia! I will continue to pray for you. What on earth are you doing? Monkey! Stop drinking brandy, repent! Do something good with your life! There is only one God and He loves you! Why do you drink brandy, instead of being with God? Believe in God, he can help you to stop drinking liquor! Turn around, God is calling you. You drink a lot! Turn back to the good path! God loves you! Stop drinking and fighting, take care of your family! God is good and he wants your best! There is only one God. The brandy has become an idol! Repent and begin to walk on the good way! You are loved by God! In the Bible it says that you should love your neighbor as yourself. When you come home drunk to your family, then how can you say that you love them? Turn back to the ways of God! Stop doing what is wrong! This is enough, arrest the girl! Understood! Ophelia Johansson, I understand that you have difficulties to follow instructions! Look here, see what happens to people who do not follow the law! Arrest her! (upset screams) (door opens, chains rattle) Here you can sit until you recover! How long do I have to sit here? You are not the only repentance crier sitting here. (singing) God is light, there is no darkness in him. God is light, there is no darkness in him. You're not an ordinary girl? They call me a Repentance crier. I can tell you something from the Word of God if you want? Do not waste your holy words on me! The Word of God is for everyone! How can you believe, when life is so miserable? The Bible says: "For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God" What does that mean? It means that even if we are sitting in this cold solitary cell, so is God with us. We can put our hope in him. He wants to shine with his love on us! I wish I could believe like you. You can! I can pray for you if you want? Yes, you may! I pray that this prisoner will find faith in you! God help him! You see his problems. You know the best, help him! I think I can see your light. God wants to help you! What do I hear here? This doesn't work, the preaching disease is contagious! Come along here, you get out of here immediately!. Get out! I can't help thinking of Ophelia. How long is she going to sit there? She has been behind bars since last summer. I miss Ophelia very much. I wish there was something we could do. We can always pray! We must not give up our hope! (singing) "Is there anyone here, who listens to the voice of God Who hears the words of his servant And can understand my way Is there anyone? Is there anyone? The servant who wanders, where everything is dark without the slightest streak of light Trusting in his Lord and leans upon God although he can't see anything The waning flame You will not quench The broken straw you will not break The waning flame, You will not quench Ophelia! Is that really you? Are you home again? What have they done to you? Can you forgive me? I have been so mean to you. I did let you down when you needed me the most. Can you forgive me? Ophelia! I forgive you Father. Cecilia! Ophelia! Is it you? I thought I had lost you. Elsa! It's Ophelia! I won't be gone anymore now. Come! I'm so glad you're home again! Not a day has passed, without me thinking about you. I have longed so much, for meeting you Märta. I can hardly believe it's true that you are home again. Hello everyone! Ophelia, how nice to see you again! We are so glad you are home again! The doctor says that Mother is well again! We really have a lot to celebrate! We have prepared for a garden party. Hope you can come? Yes, how fun. We'd love to come! Yes, we have a lot to celebrate. Rasmus has got a job! Is it true? And of course that our Ophelia has come home again. (knocks on a glass) Dear friends, I warmly welcome You all to our garden party. We are here to celebrate that so many have turned back to the way of God. We also want to celebrate that my wife Cornelia is now well from her illness. We are also happy that Ophelia is home again. Now we will celebrate and be happy! We will do so by eating Cornelia's delicious cream cake! (applause) Ophelia! Why did you leave the party? Oh Märta, I see how happy everybody is. I want to be happy, but I can't. It feels like something has died inside me. Don't be sad, it will be alright. I am sure of that. Hi Ophelia! This is Engström. Good afternoon! Aren't you the repentance crier Ophelia? Yes, it was a long time ago. I remember you. I have also been a repentance crier. I remember how you boldly stood and shouted in front of all those people and many people gave up the booze after listening to you. Take a seat here! How is Ophelia doing these days? Yes thank you. I feel great. Our Ophelia has suffered a lot because of her faith. There were many repentance criers who endured a lot of suffering. I have traveled to many places in the country and I can say that in one place after another people have given up the booze. Young people have cried out and we have seen so much fruit. I am a good example of that. I haven't touched the booze for many years. In the parish of Rydaholm it was at one occasion sixty men who gave up the booze. There are also small children, four-year-olds who have been shouting. Accounts of the child preachers passed from mouth to mouth. People came from far away to listen to them. Later, even older Repentance criers, traveled around to different parishes. When Adam Smedberg cried out a lot of people used to gather, sometimes thousands. It was too much for the authorities, who decided to arrest him. Smedberg escaped through a window. The sheriff started the hunting. Over log and stone they ran, until they could arrest him. The people managed to free him again, there was a fight. The sheriff didn't give up, the next day he brought soldiers with him who broke into the house. Smedberg was arrested and was sentenced to prison. The shouts in Kvistbro fell silent, but God continued his work. When I came to Kvistbro ten years later I discovered that there were many who were on fire for God including the landowner Hedengren. He had opened up his home for prayer. Many of the former repentance criers had joined in and did enjoy it. His wife Lina and her sister Lovisa are so passionate in their faith. Lovisa? It has to be my old teacher Lovisa. That's right... She has a sister named Lina, who is married to a landowner Hedengren. That is perfectly correct Oh, how I wish that I could meet her again! She was so precious to me. I'm actually going to travel to Riseberga again, so if is alright with your Father? Of course you shall go there. I think it is good for you to meet Lovisa again. You need to obtain a passport, when you have to travel that far. Yes, come in. Good afternoon Mr. Grundström. Good afternoon Ophelia. What do you want? I would like to ask for a passport for a journey to the parish of Fjugesta. We cannot agree to that. You have been rebellious and have created turmoil in the parish. No, we cannot authorize a passport. You see the doctor has declared me healthy now. The Vicar has made it very clear on that point. There will be no passports for any repentace criers, period. I see, good bye Mr. Grundström. Goodbye Ophelia. Good afternoon Ophelia! Good afternoon Beatrice. What has happened? I asked the Parish Clerk for a passport, but I was rejected. Why? The Vicar has decided that no repentance criers, will get any passports. It's unfair! Do you just accept that? There is nothing I can do. I don't recognize you anymore Ophelia. When you were a child, you were so determined and brave. Now you just walk around and look gloomy. Do something about it instead! Goodbye! Goodbye Beatrice. Do something about it and do something about it. What can I do? Do you hear me God? What can I do? Why am I not answering when they offend me? Why do I let them step on me? God! Can you hear me? Help! I am going to raise up again! I will not accept this anymore. You are with me every day, even this day. Ophelia, here again? Questioning authorities, as always. It's exactly how you behaved in the class room, when I was your teacher, ugh! No, Mrs Grundström, I'm not questioning authorities, only injustice. Mr. Grundström, I think a mistake has been done. A mistake, no I don't think so. A rejection is a rejection. A mistake has been done. This is not right. On the contrary, Mr. Grundström has followed my instructions. Poor people who exalt themselves and who creates confusion in the parish. They can't travel anywhere anyhow. Does Ophelia think she is an itinerant preacher? Yes, who does she think she is? (mocking laughter) What right do you have to mock me? Scripture says that he who mocks the poor, blasphemes his Creator. Ophelia, be careful with your words! The vicar has a lot of power here in the parish. Such is the will of God. Scripture says, that those who have power shall not drink brandy so that they forget the law and twist the rights of the needy children . It is true but.. Instead, he must defend the defenseless and give justice to the weak and poor. But, have I... If I´ve been causing disorder as you say I have actually served my sentence. Mr. Nordin has no right to prolong my sentence. Grundström, make a passport for Miss Johansson! I have more important things to do now. Goodbye. Hello and welcome to Riseberga Thank you! Welcome, how nice to see you! I've missed you! Did the trip go well? Did the trip go well? I guess you are hungry, wouldn't it be good with some food now? Well, you can't say no to such an offer! Welcome in! Ophelia, I have thought so much of you and I have prayed for you. I'm glad you're finally here! I am so happy to be here, I've missed you. You have been so important to me. You have meant more than you can realize. Do you remember the memory vers you gave me? I've been saving it in all these years. "God is our refuge and our strength, a help in need, well proven." A few years ago I went through hard times. We lost four of our children, within four months. Often everything was dark and I couldn't think a clearly. Then I read what was written on this note, over and over. Thank you Ophelia! I didn't know about this, I just did what God told me to do. I know how much this Bible verse has meant for Lina and her husband Olof. It has been like an outstretched hand of God to them. But you've also had a hard time Ophelia. It hurts my heart when I think about it. A new time is coming, where you will see the fruit of what you have done for God. Today we are gathered here in our house of prayer at Riseberga to rejoice over the Parliamentary Decision that repeals The Conventicle Act! We are free again in this country, to speak the word of God, to pray and to sing praises together! I have asked a younger friend to share a word. She has suffered a lot for her faith. She is a great example among us. I want to ask Ophelia to come up and share what God has placed on your heart. "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all." For a long time it was difficult for me to understand what this word meant For a long period I sat imprisoned in a dark isolated cell. The guards treated me badly. During that year it felt like I lost all hope. Now I realize, God was with me even there. Even in our darkest valley, God is with us. When all our own hope is gone, God continues to believe, to hope and to love us. What I see here today, is more than I ever dared to hope for. Children, young and elderly people gathered together from different classes in society without fear that anyone will stop us! Thank you God, for your miracle! (applause) (singing) In 1858, the Conventicle Act was abolished in Sweden. It became free to assemble, pray and read the Bible. From Riseberga the good news spread in all directions. (singing) In memory of the thousands of heroes who paved the way for a new freedom in Sweden. (ending song) English subtitles: Stefan Norberg and Henrik Viklund All glory to God!
