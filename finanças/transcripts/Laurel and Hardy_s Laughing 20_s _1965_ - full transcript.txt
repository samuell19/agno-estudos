(roaring) (orchestral music) - [Narrator] Through a cardboard door out of the past steps a beaming moon faced 23 year old comedian named Oliver Norvell Hardy. Oliver announces he's to be married in this comedy called Fatty's Fatal Fun. Made two world wars ago in 1915 when life and the movies were both much simpler. (thudding) (piano music) Babe Hardy, as he was then known, made a striking figure in his striped pants and cutaway coat. And even plausible, though plump, lover. But he was an obscure comedian in those days. One of the unknown hundreds who dashed madly about in the deluge of minor comedies that flooded the silent screen. Fame, stardom and an immortal partnership with Stan Laurel lay some 12 long years and uncountable pratfalls, pins in the pants and pies in the face ahead. Young Stan Laurel looked like this at the beginning of the decade, which silent comedy at its height was to make the laughing 20's. Stan played a brash patent medicine salesman in Kill or Cure, one of his early Hal Roach comedies. Laurel, skilled at pantomime, was polished at the best of schools, Fred Karno's English Music Mall Company, where he understudied the star Charlie Chaplin. (goofy instrumental music) Behind that bush mustache lurks Oliver Hardy. By the mid 20's Hardy had joined the Hal Roach organization where he continued to play supporting roles despite a mad studio search for badly needed new comedy stars. Vivien Oakland begins to succumb to the musical charms of her new border, Milton the Mad Maestro. (slide whistle descending) (boinging) In this 1926 blend of slapstick and French bedroom farce husband Glenn Tryon completes the triangle as Oliver fiddles while Vivien burns. (violin music) (slide whistle descending) (violin music) Six months later Laurel and Hardy were both to appear in a Hal Roach comedy called 45 minutes from Hollywood, but never in the same scene together. (boinging) Stan is almost unrecognizable behind that big black mustache as an innocent hotel guest harassed by a pair of battling intruders. (dramatic music) Hardy clad in a sheet is the house detective struggling to break up the fight by breaking down the door. (dramatic music) By the following year, 1927, Laurel and Hardy had been cast together several times and were beginning to pair up purely by accident. In films like Sugar Daddies can be seen the gradual evolution of one of the greatest of comedy teams. (thudding) (lighthearted music) But four years in the names Laurel and Hardy blazed from the screen. Costars at last in Putting Pants on Philip. The first film billed to the talents of Stanley and Oliver. The plot was supremely simple. Uncle Ollie had just met nephew Stan at the boat. Stan is visiting from Scotland and the attention attracted by his kilts mightily embarrasses natty Hardy, one of the 10 best dressed men in upper Sandusky. "Walk behind me," says Oliver, "far behind." (bagpipe music) Uncle Ollie pleads with the rapidly growing crowd to disperse. With Hardy in the role of a sport and Laurel as of all unthinkable things a lady chaser, Putting Pants on Philip differs from the later Laurel and Hardy films for Stan and Oliver had yet to invent the fumbling derby hatted characters that were to make them world famous. Years later when his career had ended Stan Laurel was to name this his favorite comedy. (dog barking) (whimsical music) (bagpipe music) (sneezing) (whimsical music) (gasping) (whimsical music) Laurel and Hardy were old pros who in hundreds of pictures had thoroughly learned the exacting job of being silent screen comedians. Laurel was in addition a comedy innovator and many of Stan and Oliver's best gags were to originate with him. They worked without pretension and for the moment. Little dreaming that their comedy would continue to delight audiences more than 20 years after the camera stopped grinding and the glee lights flickered out. (whimsical music) (boinging) (chattering) Oliver dashed toward a building which residents of the Los Angeles area have doubtless already recognized as the Culver City Hotel. Like so many Hal Roach comedies Philip was shot with an eye to economy just a block or two from the studio itself. (whimsical music) (chattering) What's all the excitement about, wonders Hardy. The director of this first Laurel and Hardy starring comedy was Clyde Bruckman, a master of the sight gag who was also to direct Harold Lloyd. The cameraman was George Stevens, famous today as the producer director of Shane, Giant and The Greatest Story Ever Told. (whimsical music) (chattering) (whimsical music) (chattering) (whimsical music) "Hold it," says Uncle Oli, "let me show you how." (whimsical music) "Just an old Scottish custom," says Stanley. (whimsical music) "Just an old American custom," says Oliver. (boinging) (popping) (whimsical music) (chattering) A swank dinner party is afoot at the J. Medberry Frumps', a newly rich couple just learning to dog paddle in the social swim. At the door a new butler and waiter fresh from their triumphs assistant deck swabs at Dougan's Bean Wagon. In the few months between Putting Pants on Philip and this comedy, called From Soup to Nuts, Laurel and Hardy had found their derbies and the characters they were to play for the rest of their movie lives. (orchestral music) (thudding) (orchestral music) (thudding) (orchestral music) "I have fallen down," admits Oliver. (orchestral music) The harassed hostess is Anita Garvin, one of the Hal Roach studio's harem of girls who could remain appealing through every slapstick indignity. (growling) (thudding) (growling) (orchestral music) (thudding) (orchestral music) "I have fallen down again," Oliver confesses. This tribute to the cake bakers' art was directed by E. Livingston Kennedy, better known as comedian Edgar Kennedy, master of the slow burn. (orchestral music) (thudding) (orchestral music) Host Frump, played by Tiny Sandford grabs for a towel, only it's not a towel, it's Stanley's shirt. (thumping) (orchestral music) (thudding) In this moment of crises Stanley takes command. (orchestral music) (thudding) (orchestral music) "Over here, double quick," says Anita. "Did you gong Madame?" asks the efficient Oliver. (orchestral music) Anita orders, "please have the salad served, undressed." Fastidious Hardy dishes up the soup while greens man Laurel's in the kitchen preparing the salad. Chip and Dale you made the chairs too high. (orchestral music) (fabric tearing) (orchestral music) (boinging) Alert to every order Stan serves the salad undressed. (orchestral music) Says Stanley to the host, "they wanted it served undressed "and that's the way they're gonna get it." (orchestral music) (whimsical music) (gasping) (thudding) (whimsical music) (gasping) (thudding) (orchestral music) In 1927 Jimmy Finlayson, Laurel and Hardy, and Charley Chase, Hal Roach's top stars in their only appearance together improvised comedy on the spot as carefree inmates of the happy asylum. In a mousetrap microphone Charlie finds lunch. Stan and Oliver as William Tell and target. (orchestral music) The moral of this episode is that if you think you're a wheelbarrow you're sure to get pushed around. (orchestral music) There's a home movie quality to these silent clowns cavorting on a long departed sunny afternoon on the Hal Roach lot. Meeting an ocean liner impatient Charley Chase spots his lady love Viola Richard on the upper deck. Viola goes to the left. Charlie follows and fate's fickle finger flicks man hating Anita Garvin smack into his path. (thudding) (whimsical music) Charley Chase was the silent films' undisputed master of the comedy of embarrassment. He was also Hal Roach's most popular player until the skyrocketing success of his old friends Laurel and Hardy in the last years of the laughing 20's. (whimsical music) (thudding) (sighing) (whimsical music) "One minute," says Charlie. "I forgot something important. "My hat." (whimsical music) (boinging) The impulse that cannot be denied. (thudding) (water splashing) (whimsical music) They meet at last. A veteran of the Roach lot Charlie directed comedies under his real name Charles Parrott and starred as Paul Parrott and Jimmy Jump before becoming the dapper, impulsive Charley Chase, a character perfectly suited for the jaunty jazz age. (jazz music) In his yard chicken king Schultz posed with his prize rooster, grand champion at the international poultry show. On the other side of the fence is Schultz's gardening neighbor the beloved, beset Max Davidson who like Charley Chase, Laurel and Hardy starred in his own series of comedies during the golden silent days at the Roach studios. If any vegetables grow around here they'll grow inside Schultz's seed gobbling chickens. (jazz music) (clucking) Naturally of all the chickens Max grabs the champion and naturally just at that moment the terrible tempered Mr. Schultz is looking through the fence. (whimsical music) (whistling) (boinging) Life, prosperity, flaming youth and bathtub gin, screen comedy was a hallmark of the 1920's. In the picture parade that caused peels of laughter to ring out of every movie theater in the land was Laurel and Hardy's Wrong Again, written and directed by Leo McCarey who later created such film classics as Going My Way. (whimsical music) Stable hand Stan and Oliver made the horses look smart. (whimsical music) (clanging) Our masterminds overhear there's a big reward for the stolen Blue Boy. There in the stable he is. Quiet now, mustn't give the game away. They'll grab this reward all for themselves. Meanwhile detectives Croveny and Greaves apprehend the crooks and recover Blue Boy, the painting Blue Boy that is. Croveny phones the good news to millionaire owner Augustus Paddle. "Don't piddle paddle," orders Paddle. "Bring that painting over at once." (gun firing) Stan and Oliver arrive with the equine Blue Boy. Paddle, who in the way of the eccentric rich, is taking his Saturday night bath on Monday afternoon throws down the keys. "You mean in the house?" asks Hardy. Expecting his painting, Paddle says, "yes," never dreaming that this Blue Boy has four hooves and a tail and may not be house broken. (horse neighing) (whimsical music) (thudding) (whimsical music) Paddle calls from the balcony, "put Blue Boy on top of the piano, would you mind?" Stan who has been told millionaires are peculiar and think just the reverse from other people wouldn't mind in the least. The Hal Roach studio where this comedy was made has been demolished joining in limbo the Max Senate Studio torn down some years before and so both of America's two greatest laugh factories have disappeared from the scene. (whimsical music) (horse neighing) (whimsical music) (water slurping) (whimsical music) A car arrives at the Paddle estate. In it are Paddle's dowager mother, detectives Croveny and Greaves and the Blue Boy that doesn't whinny. "Shh," cautions Oliver. "Someone's coming, we'll give them a big surprise." (orchestral music) "There's Blue Boy," thunders Paddle, "what did you bring?" "We made a slight mistake," laughs Oliver. (whimsical music) "Don't stop me," cries Paddle, "read about the murder in tomorrow's paper." (whimsical music) "No damage ma'am," reassures Croveny. "Detective Greaves is only stunned." Anders Randolph, a leading villain of silent days, took time off from supporting such glamorous stars as Greta Garbo to act as a foil for Charley Chase. (sneezing) Charley plays a type as common as bad dreams at tax time, the pest with the sneezes. (orchestral music) (sneezing) (orchestral music) (sneezing) (orchestral music) Sight gag comedy, the great silent clowns and fumeless smooth riding trolley cars like the one shown here have all but disappeared. Progress doesn't always mean that things get better. (orchestral music) (sneezing) (orchestral music) (sneezing) (orchestral music) (sneezing) (orchestral music) (sneezing) (orchestral music) Charley is determined to save Anders' life if he as to kill him to do it. (water splashing) (orchestral music) (water splashing) (orchestral music) Laurel and Hardy, contractors, arrive to finish a house. A New York Times editorial years later was to remember skinny Stan the bow playing against fat Oliver the fiddle and recalled the gay ingenious music they struck together. In the finishing touch the fiddle and the bow achieved a symphony of sight gags within a total orchestra of just five people. The owner approaches the master builders and offers them a bonus if they finish on time. "That we will," declares Oliver. (plodding music) (thudding) (whimsical music) (thudding) Nurse Dorothy Coburn complains to cop Edgar Kennedy, "you got the authority, "make that track team over there cut out the noise." (whimsical music) "Listen," says Kennedy, "if you must make noise "make it quietly, this is a hospital zone." (shushing) (orchestral music) (thudding) (shushing) (orchestral music) Boss Hardy orders, "get them nails out of the way." (orchestral music) (thudding) (orchestral music) "Who's in charge here," asks the nurse. "Be quiet now or be quiet forever," threatens Dorothy. (orchestral music) (thumping) (orchestral music) (thumping) (orchestral music) (thudding) (orchestral music) (shushing) (orchestral music) (thumping) (orchestral music) (thudding) (orchestral music) (thudding) (shushing) (high pitched chattering) "Oh shut up," says Kennedy. The law can take no more but gets it anyway. (boinging) (thumping) (whimsical music) (thudding) (whimsical music) (boinging) (whimsical music) Through skill, sweat and sheer chance the house is finished on schedule. The proud and happy owner arrives to pay Stan and Oliver their promised bonus. The first bird of spring. (rumbling) (thudding) (whimsical music) "Give me back my money," cries the owner. Unfortunately the firm of Laurel and Hardy has a policy of no refunds. (orchestral music) (thumping) (whimsical music) (thumping) (whimsical music) (thudding) (whimsical music) (clanging) (whimsical music) (splashing) (thudding) (whimsical music) (thudding) (whimsical music) (thudding) (whimsical music) The finishing touch. (rumbling) (boinging) (whimsical music) Look who's moving into the house that Laurel and Hardy built. It's Max Davidson with his wife Lillian Elliott and his son Spec O'Donnell. The neighbors gossip about the new owners of a home it took five days to build and five years to sell. (whimsical music) Not only does this house have running water it has leaping electricity. (whimsical music) (water pouring) (whimsical music) A special linoleum for people who change their minds. If you don't like the design just mop it off. (whimsical music) (water flowing) Mama calls to Max to help move the piano. In 1927 this comedy Call of the Cuckoo hit home to a lot of families whose jerry-built dream castles had turned to nightmares. It still hits home today. An approaching invasion of relatives. "Is the floor crooked?" Max brings in his spirit level. The only way to straighten that floor is to tilt the world. The house warmers, their goodwill is exceeded only by their hearty appetites. The arrival of relatives downstairs gives Max the urge to go for a bath upstairs. (orchestral music) In bursts the horde shouting for directions to the dining room. (orchestral music) "Does your coffee taste different lately?" Says guest to wife, "with this stuff and a razor I could shave." (water pouring) (whimsical music) Youthful spirits liven a dull afternoon. (slap thwacking) (whimsical music) (slap thwacking) (whimsical music) (thumping) Says Sophie to Samantha, "if I weren't a lady I'd belt you in the kisser." (whimsical music) (shattering) "Not the telephone," cries Max. "We'll be sued by AT&T." (shattering) (whimsical music) (piano clanging) The picture is called Liberty and liberty is just what Stan and Oliver have foremost on their minds. Written and directed by Leo McCarey, this comedy was released in 1929 when Laurel and Hardy had reached their peak. Both the laughing 20's and the golden age of silent comedy were drawing to a close. (whimsical music) (gun firing) "We brought your clothes from the old apartment," says Getaway Gus. (whimsical music) (siren blaring) (whimsical music) Stan has traveling trousers, and Oliver's in a pinch. "We'd better switch pants," says Hardy. (whimsical music) (screaming) (whimsical music) (thudding) "Something bit me," whimpers Stanley. (whimsical music) (thudding) (whimsical music) "Something bit him," explains Oliver. (shattering) (whimsical music) "Get to the ladder," directs Hardy, who little realizes he's gotten back not only his own pants, but also an extremely lively future seafood dinner. (whimsical music) "This is no time for pinching," cries crab nipped Oliver. Producer Hal Roach was a past master at that delicious blend of comedy and terror to be derived from peril in high places. (whimsical music) The ladder, Hardy's idea of safety at last. (whimsical music) (thudding) (whimsical music) "Now why did you do that?" asks Oliver. (whimsical music) Says Oliver to Stanley, "hang onto this and relax." (thudding) (whimsical music) In a classic comedy called Dumb Daddies Max Davidson demonstrates the dangers of carrying a show window mannequin across town. The crowd wonders what murderous Max has in that sack and deduces that it's got to be a body. (orchestral music) (gasping) (orchestral music) (whistling) (dog barking) (orchestral music) (dog barking) Officer Kennedy asks Max if he saw a seedy guy with a sack. "Is it yes or no?" cries the exasperated Kennedy. (whimsical music) Into thin air. (thudding) "I'm ruined." (thudding) Along comes a gentleman who has been picking up too many glasses that were full and setting down too many glasses that are empty. (woozy music) "Your leg Madam." (woozy music) (thudding) Now a finale of Laurel and Hardy highlights believed by some critics to be among the screens funniest moments. In Double Whoopee the prince of Pillenstein to whom Erich von Stroheim movies were mother's milk brings old world glamour and bad credit to a New York hotel. (orchestral music) "Speech, speech." (applauding) (orchestral music) (thudding) (orchestral music) (speaking in a foreign language) yells the prince. In my country this would mean death. (thudding) (whimsical music) In Leave 'Em Laughing those madcaps motorists Stan and Oliver overdose with laughing gas at the dentist, explode with mirth at their homemade traffic jam. That arm of the law for every occasion, Officer Kennedy, isn't amused. (whimsical music) "It's off to the station house," explains Kennedy. (whimsical music) (thudding) (whimsical music) Climaxing Two Tars Laurel and Hardy drive into a railroad tunnel, their worst possible avenue of escape from a band of pursuing Sunday drivers. (train whistle blowing) (horns honking) In Habeas Corpus Oliver the agile scales a wall. (rumbling) (whimsical music) In the Second Hundred Years escaped convicts Stan and Ollie prove they're painters by smearing everything in sight. (gasping) The film, You're Darn Tootin demonstrates Laurel and Hardy's peculiar talent for having their private life embroil the whole town. (boinging) (whimsical music) (thudding) The battle of the century transformed that old slapstick standby the pie in the face into Armageddon. (whimsical music) (thudding) (whimsical music) (buzzer buzzing) In We Faw Down the boys are bathrobed innocents drying off after getting wet aiding two ladies in distress. (whimsical music) "Be bohemian," says Oliver. (whimsical music) At that moment of abandon who should enter but the lady's boyfriend, vVcious Vincent, alias Nasty Nate. (suspenseful music) (whimsical music) (clanging) (whimsical music) Just passing by Laurel and Hardy's wives, human bloodhounds, master hen peckers and crack shots. Into the distance and into memory. We will never see their like again. (gun firing) (acoustic music)
