John Buckman: Well, I mean, I don't know, but they say that's what he said. Mornin', pa. - I know what he said. - Oh, mornin... If he said... John: If he does... Mornin', Paul. What he says, well... Then, what do you... What do you aimto do about it? What would you like me to do? Well, hell, he's... he's, uh... He's... he's got 3,000 head of sheep there, pa, and he's braggin' about grazin' "em on r-bar grass. I... I think there's, uh... What? Only one thing to do. What's that? Run 'em off... Pa, just run "em off, that's all. Hmm. A man's that crazy, you're probably right. Yeah. Hmm. Meanwhile, we got lot of work ahead of us, you eat up and let's get to it. Heh. Paul: Pass the eggs, little brother. Eggs! Man: How 'bout some more coffee? Second man: All right. Hyah! Come on, move on, move on. Let's go. Git on! Hyah! Move. Move on out! Hyah! Yaa. Yaa! Good evenin", Nell. It's been a long, hard day. Good god almighty. Now, what the hell happened? He just went loco. He started kickin', snappin... Paul: He's dead, pa. Man: Damn jughead. I warned Barney yes... All right. Let's get doin" what we're supposed to do. Bodine, you and Post take him into town. Get a blanket. I'll get his stuff together and go into town tomorrow to make arrangements. Any family? Well, he talked about an uncle in muskogee. - Good man. - Yeah. Get another. With roundup in a few days, we need him. Ok. Paul! What the hell's the matter with you? What'd I do? You know, I been thinkin' about what happened. It just don't make no goddamn sense to me. I mean, one minute there's Barney, and the next... Because some goddamn loco jughead... You know, what I'm tryin' to say is... I can't even get the way to say it. Yeah, 'cause it don't seem real. Oh, it sure don't. You know, somethin' like that happens... Somethin' that a man's got no control over. Somethin' that he'll never understand no matter what way he looks at it. Like a really bad, crazy dream. Yeah. And it can scare hell outta you, too. You know, the thing that scares a man the most is to find out and discover just how uncertain life really is. Like that, you know, thing happened to Barney. Realizin', even if he don't want to admit it, that deep down in his gut it just as easy could've been him and might be, any minute, any second. Crazy jughead. Somethin' like that. Of course, it's natural to chew on it. But sooner or later you just gotta get rid of it and get on with what you got. Ain't nothin' much you can do about it anyway. Ain't nothin' much?! Ain't nothin"! Gotta do the best with what you got while you got it. Ain't that the way you see it, Ross? Sure is the way I see it. You scared of dyin'? Yeah, kinda. Except, I sure as hell don't spend much time thinkin' about it. Yeah, me either. No. Uhh! Wow! Hah! Hmm, mmm. Yeah, that banker man's got himself a real nice woman. Yeah, but about 5 years she won't be lookin' so nice, and that banker man is gonna see you walkin' down the street some day with a sassy young thing, and he's gonna say to himself, "mmm, that cowboy's really got himself a nice woman." And he's gonna envy you somethin' fierce. 'Cause he's stuck with his, and you can just trade yours in anytime you feel like it. Ain't you ever felt like gettin' married? Oh, I've felt like it a hundred times, but there's a big difference between feelin' and doin... Thank god I just been feelin... Ain't you ever wanted to have children? Oh, I got children. Two I know of, and there's bound to be more. Oh, no, I mean raise a family, settle down. What the hell for? You can't be a puncher all your life. You've gotta plan for something, don't you? You never been to Mexico, huh? There's a place down there that a man with a little money can get himself a damn fine spread. Plenty of people to get the work done. Lots of time for lyin' around soakin' up the sun, lovin' those young, black-eyed beauties. Sounds good. Yeah. You savin' your money? Ha ha. You savin' yours? Shoot! I try. I can't seem to save nothin... Why should I be any different? Because you're... I'm older, wiser. I've learned. I've had experience. - Yeah. - Hell, Frank, you show me a young cowboy or an old cowboy or an in-between cowboy that's got more than a few dollars in his poke, and I'll show you a cowboy who stopped bein' a cowboy and started robbin' banks. Well, then let's you and me Rob us a bank. That's safer than gettin' married. - Get up, there! - Mmm. Get up, there! Dear lord, we thank you for this food we are about to receive, and we pray that you take our recently departed friend Barney Drago into your loving care and keep him safe. Amen. Soup. Well, here's to Barney. Poor bastard. But you know, if it's gotta happen... I'd rather have it happen like that. You know, quick like, so you don't think about it beforehand. You know what? You know what? I'm really gettin' drunk. Congratulations. I am gettin' too drunk. I ain't had nothin' to eat since breakfast, you know. Neither have I. I can't handle a whole lot of whiskey unless I got somethin' solid in my stomach first. I don't wanna spoil your fun or nothin', but if I don't eat pretty soon... Now, look, you're not gonna spoil my fun. Come on. Get you a big steak. Well, we'll come right back to it. Maybe we'll stop off at Maybell's. Well, why not? I ain't had none of that for a while, either. But I want us to have one drink first, see. Are you sure? One drink's ok because it sort of makes my appetite a little sharper. I can tell just exactly when I'm ready... wait. Uh, this one's to you, Ross, and to Mexico... And to, uh, that ranch you're gonna have yourself someday. To someday. Somethin' stinks in here. Well, it ain't me, Ross. Smells like sheep. I think we'd better have one more. Oh, shit. Good evening. Ross, the man here... I believe he wants to talk to you. Oof! - You ok? - Yeah, I'm ok. You son of a bitch. Aah! You goddamn animal! Ooh! Ooh! Why, you miserable... Get outta here. Thanks, Dave. Don't mention it, Ross. You all right, partner? Unh! Ooh. Good job, Frank. Dave: Art, gimme a hand with the big red. He's stuck on the wall. God damn it. I no sooner get this place all fixed up... I'm an old Texas cowboy far away from home if I ever get home to Texas I never again will roam Montana's too damn cold for me and the winters are so long before the roundup will begin my money is all gone I've worked down in Nebraska... Ohh. Is there anything here for me? Oh, that sheepherder Hansen and a couple of his men are clutterin' up the place, that's all. Bodine? Huh? Mmm, howdy, sheriff. You look a mite peaked. You want to spend the night in town? I can fix you up with a cell. No, I'm just gonna lie here and rest my way back to health. Now, look, we're gonna be just fine. You just point us in the right direction. Hyah, yah! Oh, god. Am I sick. Yeah, well, there's one thing for certain... What's that? It can't get any worse. Frank: Goddamn! Bodine. Bodine. Yeah. Hey, Bodine, - huh? - Wake up. Wake up. Come on, wake up, Bodine. Oh... What the hell did you two get into last night? You stink like a couple of rancid polecats. Better wash off and change right quick, or you're gonna miss breakfast. Flapjacks and sausage. Oh, god. Giddyap! Oh! Unh! What the hell you doin' down there? Come on! Giddyup. Mayden's a cow town, and most of it was built with r-bar money. It's your town, but if you kill somebody, you're gonna be arrested... And if you bust up the saloon, you're gonna have to pay for it. I'll have a talk with Dave and see what he figures the damages comes to, and then I'll, uh, oh, I'll take somethin', just a little somethin' each month from your pay. West fence. Yeah, I bet he... Busted a couple of saloons in his time. More than a couple, and he probably paid for 'em, too. Sheriff. Walt: Bill! Hansen: He ain't in here. Well, if it ain't the big man himself. Hansen, you've been spoutin' off your mouth. Now I've got somethin' to say. If you set one foot on r-bar land, if one sheep grazes one blade of r-bar grass, you're dead. Bill Jackson! Sheriff! Bill: Who is it? It's Walt Buckman. Come out here! All right, all right. I'm coming. Oh, god damn it! Woman: Hey, where ya goin' with the blanket? - Come on. - Whoa! Gimme that... Get back in, for Christ's sake. Oh, Walt. Ugh. What can I do for ya? I want you to turn Hansen loose. I gave him fair warnin', so if he's gonna start somethin', let's get it over with. All right. I'll see you for supper Saturday. Hyah! Hy-hy-hy-hyah! Hyah! Hyah hyah! Hyah hyah! Hey, Bodine? Yeah? I been thinkin'... How old are you? I'll be 46 in July. I'll be 50 in July. Jesus. Phew. Why? Well, in another 25 years, I'm gonna be just like you. Well, what's wrong with that? Well, I'd rather be rich. I'd rather have that ranch and all them pretty girls now than bust my butt, and break my bones punchin' cows for the next 25 years. You got a point. Well, then, let's you and me ride into town tonight and Rob us that bank. Oh. Oh, it's you, huh? Uh, how do you feel? I feel fine, pa. Why? Ooh, uh, I was just thinkin... I'm goin' to St. Louis the end of the month... Wanna come along? Well, yeah. - Yeah. - Spend a couple of weeks. Take care of some business. Have a little fun. Listen, can I tell you for sure about... About what? It's about St. Louis. I mean... You don't have to make up your mind right away. I'm goin'. I gotta go. I gotta take care of things. I'd love to have you come if you feel like. If you don't, there's no sweat. Strictly up to you. Yeah. Aah! Whoo. What's that? What's, uh... Walt: What's what? What's up to him this time? He's making up his mind if he wants to come with me to St. Louis or not. Oh, he is, huh? Yes, he is. Somethin' wrong with St. Louis... Hell, no, John, it's just... Would you like to come? Hell, yeah, I'd like to come. Shoot, he's... I knew you would, yeah. You did? Where the hell they goin'? Town, I expect. Hey, where you goin', Bodine? Ross: To town. Well, what the hell for? We got roundup tomorrow. We'll be back in time. I never knew of old Bodine goin" to town except Saturday nights since I knowed him. Well, he sure went to town last night. No, no, I mean of his own hoof, pa. Walt: Yeah, I know what you mean. Hey... I bet I know what he's up to. Damn you, boy. Supper's ready. Uh-heh. Comin... You decide to come along, and, uh... I'll get that new saddle for ya. What, what? What, what? Joe: Who's there? Bill Jackson. Oh, it's the sheriff. Hey... Maybell Tucker is bringin' in a new chippy from Kansas City... Watch your mouth. Well, it's, uh... That's why them... Them two went to town, pa. That's not somethin' we talk about in front of your mother. Sorry. Don't be so rough on him, Walt. He's a man now. Then he oughta have a little more respect. I know about Maybell Tucker. Well, that's not the point... Is it, Nell? No, I guess it isn't. Look, isn't this... It's awaste of time talkin', Joe. Wait till you get it done. The less chance there is of somethin' goin' wrong and everybody bein' unhappy. Come here. Come here. Yeah, good old thing. Well, you look like you just had yourself a whole bunch of pups. How long ago she had the pups? Well, it couldn't have been too long ago. You're still full of milk. Let's see. Mmm. Right sweet, yeah. A lot of people have their life savings in that bank. Yes, ma'am, I... See, I... I can't honestly get too upset about it, 'cause I ain't never done nothin' like this before. I sure ain't expectin' on doin' it again, either. That doesn't make it right. No, no, but when I... When I think about all the stuff I'm gonna do with that money, it don't make it all that wrong, either. Yeah. Now, listen, when we get to town, the first thing you do is go right to the bank, and if anybody asks you what you're doin', you got an answer? No, I never go to the bank at night. Well, you'd better think of somethin... You know you're not gonna get away with it. Well, the way I look at it, Joe, it's kinda up to you whether we get away with it or not, 'cause when you consider what's at stake... I mean, all that money, your wife, your family, things like that... You'd better play it pretty smart. But all I meant was that even if you did get the money, sooner or later, they're bound to catch up with you. You just concentrate on gettin' the money. I'll worry about gettin' caught. Johnny. Johnny! She ain't even due in till next week. You wanna bet on that? I'll bet she got in early, and them two horny cowboys found out about it, heh. Why would Maybell say she's due in next week if she ain't due in next week, huh? Naw. Maybe Maybell don't tell nobody else, but she'd tell Bodine. You know how fired up she gets every time that old stud Bodine gets around. You believe all that bodine bullshit? I surely do. You comin' with me or ain't you? - Wait a minute, John. - Come on. Paul: Trust me, John. Now, I'm your brother. John: Yeah, I know you're my brother, I can trust you'll buy that round. Come on, John. Goin' to town to see what Post and Bodine are up to. Yeah, pa. What so special about Kansas City chippies, Paul? Oh, hell, John, I don't know. It's just a damn woman. Roundup starts tomorrow morning. Your boys are more interested in a 2-bit whore from Kansas City. Why is it whenever they do something you disapprove of, they're always "my boys?" Because if they was mine... If they was mine, I'd have peeled the hide off of 'em a long time ago and taught 'em the meaning of respect and responsibility... But you raised "em, Nell. Hmm? You raised 'em your way, so I figure you deserve the credit. Good night. Good night, Walt. Chippies got marvelous legs, the highest hips, and they say the most beautiful biggest tits I have ever seen on a woman. The baby's hungry. Young man. Get out. She has to feed the baby. Just remember, I got your mama out here. Good old girl. What's up? What's up? She has a litter of puppies under the porch. I expect she wants out. - Big litter? - 11. 3 died. Ok. That's it. I raise. Oh, hiya, Ross. Howdy, Dave. Uh-huh. Sorry about last night. Yeah? Well, let me tell you somethin... You got somethin' to be sorry about. Well, you know somethin'? You hit pretty hard. Oh, I do, do I? Well, what's your pleasure this time? Whiskey. Woman: Aw, come on. Man: I gotta get home. Woman: Oh, I don't think so. Come on, Kevin. I am Jose. Woman: Oh, well, no, you're not. You gimme those. Woman: No. What did you say your name was? I hear Barney Drago got himself killed. Yeah, he got, uh, jammed up in a corral. Horse kicked him. Tch. Can't trust them jugheads. I had me one once... You know, with that faraway look in his eye? Tch. Bad. Sure can take a man to some crazy places. Yeah. I knowed the first time I swung a leg over his ugly hide, he was out to get me... And you know, he didn't give a good goddamn if he got hisself while he's doin' the gettin', either. Man had any sense, he'd, uh, save his money and get into some other kinda work. Yeah... But where are you gonna find a cowboy that's got any sense? That's true. Another one, Dave. What the hell did he tie you up for out here? Didn't he know there's a bank robbery goin' on? Woman: Hey, Luann, you gonna play or not? Second woman: What? You gonna play stud? Sure. Bodine: Joe? Open up. Joe: It's open. Hey, looks like they're here, all right. You're damn right, they is. The horses is. There's old Charley boy. Yeah, that don't mean a thing if that Kansas City chippy's not here. She's here. Those sons of bitches. Don't let it bother you. We're goin' to the sheriff, and then you're gonna convince your partner to release my family. I should've listened to Frank. He said that if I left you alone for a few seconds you'd try to do something foolish, and here I was givin' you credit for havin' more sense. You tell Frank if he doesn't hurt anybody, I won't prosecute. You and him can just clear out. Take off. And you got my word. The law won't touch you. Well, under the circumstances, I'd say that's a pretty fair proposition. But, I'd like it a whole lot better if the sheriff was sayin' them words. Hold it! Joe, you know as well as I do the sheriff's not gonna make any promises like that, leastwise none that he's gonna keep. No, as far as I'm concerned, the sheriff's out. Then I've got no choice. Well, that's a damn shame... For both of us. I don't care what kind of a man he is, he's not gonna hurt a little baby. You're probably right, Joe... But he'll kill your wife without even battin' an eye. Mr. Buckman, if Ross Bodine and Frank Post was here... What the hell are their goddamn horses doin'... I don't know what the hell their horses are doin' out front, but they ain't in here! Bullshit. Come on, Maybell. This is my house, Mr. Buckman, and when you call me a liar, honey, you ain't welcome. Get. Come on, Joe. Yeah. You a drinkin man, Joe? - What? - I mean, what do you do when you ain't workin' at the bank? Eh, you go fishin'? What are you getting at? Oh, nothin' in particular. I just thought it'd look a lot less suspicious if we was havin' a friendly conversation. Last time I went fishin' is when I was a kid down in Del Mar, Texas. Daddy used to take me out to the creek on Sunday afternoons after church, and... I'd sit there and fish all afternoon while he smoked his smelly old pipe. I mean, it'd get dark, and he'd even light a lantern. Woman: I'm tellin' ya, don't let me be tellin' ya all week. They ain't due till next week. Probably after Wednesday. John: Hey, bodine! Who's that? Well, it looks like young Johnny Buckman. What does he want? He'll let us know when he gets here. You just take it easy and let me do the talkin... What's up, Johnny? You know, uh, Joe Billings. Joe: Mr. Buckman. Joe. Uh, where the hell is, uh, Post? Walt: Last time I saw him, he was headin' into Maybell's. Why? Well, that's his horse, isn'tit? Oh, yeah, uh... Joe's horse, uh, cast a shoe, and Rufus Coleman was havin' supper. Couldn't get it shod for a couple hours, so Joe was worried about gettin' home too late, and Frank loaned him Charley boy... And he was more than happy to spend some more time at Maybell's. Anything wrong? No, no, no. I, uh... Well, I just thought you and Post had come into town to get a crack at that new chippy that Maybell's bringin' in from Kansas City. Well, she's not due for another week. Yeah, yeah, right. I thought, uh... What the hell was all that with Maybell? What did she lie to me for? Said that, uh, she hadn't seen Post. He wasn't there. Well, I'll be damned. That's peculiar, 'cause he's there. Son of a bitch. I'll see you at the ranch. Sure, Johnny. You know, there's one thing you can count on with young John. He's got a short fuse. When it starts smokin', he doesn't spend too much time figurin' things out. He's liable to wreck the place. Well, whatever he does, he's liable to keep a lot of people busy for quite a spell... Includin' the sheriff. Get your lyin' ass out here, Maybell! No 2-bit whore slut's gonna lieto John Buckman and get away with it! I wait all goddamn night for a hand like that, and then some inconsiderate son of a bitch has gotta decide to shoot up the son-of-a-bitchin' town. I know Frank Post's in there, I'm gonna find out why the hell you say he ain't. All right, Maybell, you get your ass out here. Hey, post ain't in there, huh? What's going on here? I don't know. I was asleep. You crazy bastard! You cut loose with that 6-gun just one more time, I swear I'll let you have both barrels. Why'd you tell me you haven't seen Frank Post? Because I haven't! Bullshit! You "bullshit" me one more time, John Buckman, and it'll be your last bullshit! He's in there right now. He ain't! And even if he was, why would I say he wasn't? Well, that's what I'm trying to find out, dummy! John, hold it, brother. Hey, you're spoiling a whole lot of good fun now. Bodine says Post is in there right now. John, what the hell difference does it make? It makes a hell of a lot of difference, 'cause something's going on around here! John! No! That ought to convince him. If it doesn't, shoot his horse. - Shoot his horse? - Ah, then shoot him. But you've got to explain it to his pappy. John: That wasn't too goddamn funny! Ha ha ha! Maybell: Now, what is this? What's going on? Frank? Hey, Ross, is that you? Yeah. Me and Joe Billings. Joe: What is it? What's wrong? Cougar. I hurt him, but I don't think he's dead. So you be real careful where you put your foot down. Where's Sada and the baby? They're in the house. Stop worrying about your family, and you start concentrating on that cat. Hey, Ross, he's a big one. Tried to get that ol' bitch and her pups. Put up quite a fight 'fore he killed her. You stop talking. We're coming in. Easy now, Joe. Unh. You all right? Yeah. Damn! How'd it go? Oh, a few bright moments. Beginning to give me a headache. Oh, I don't wonder. How much? 36,000. Holy sweet love of Jesus! I'm comin' up all over in duck bumps. Whew. Oh. Oh. God. Molly Brown is dead. Don't look. She's all mangled. - There's a box in... - Yes. The kitchen. You all right? Sada: Jenny's sleeping. We need 2 horses and supplies, Joe. Help me bury her. Yeah, sure. We've only got one horse. Go with Joe and get the horse. I'll do the burying. No! I don't want you to bury them. If you won't let Joe help me, then I'll manage alone. Where's the horse? Out back by the lean-to. If anybody shows up, get 'em into the house pronto. Don't forget your hat. Il trust ya. Hey, Joe, I've been thinkin... How much the boys at the r-bar gonna be out come payday? Uh, 23... no, 2,500. Mm-hmm. Oh. Well, there's 3,000. That's 2,500 for the r-bar and 500 for you and your family. Ross and me get plenty, and, uh... Well, you know, it's one thing stealin' from strangers and fellas you hardly know well enough to say howdy to, but, uh, those punchers out at r-bar, they've been pretty good compadres. Frank: Hey, Ross, let's go! Right! Now, you understand I'm not trying to cancel out any friendships. As matter of fact, if I'm lucky, I'll pick up a few. We don't want the 500. Aw, now come on, Joe, take it. Now, you and your family kind of got the shi... Well, uh, the dirty end of the stick tonight, and you earned it. We didn't earn anything. We didn't do anything willingly. Frank: Hey, Ross! Yeah?! Shh. Look, I don't care what you do with it, 'cause I ain't got time to argue. But you be sure those boys at r-bar get this with the compliments of Frank Post and Ross Bodine! I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble. Trouble?! What, they givin' ya a farewell party or somethin'? I just left 'em something so they wouldn't forget us. Since when did bank robbers have trouble being remembered? Oh. Uh, Walter... Easy, boy. Easy, boy. Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. Come on. It's Charley boy. Belongs to Frank Post. Somethin' sure scared him. You said Johnny and Paul rode out after Frank Post and Ross Bodine. Yeah. Well, that don't mean much. It turnin' cold, huh? You ought to put more on. At least, uh, put somethin' more around your shoulders. I didn't know you were awake. Yeah. Would you like me to fix you some chocolate? Fine. Fine. We're not gonna give it back. They stole it. They're gonna hang or go to prison. Whether they gave you $3,000 doesn't make... Jesus Christ, sada! God damnit to hell! Why can't you say anything without swearing? What do you think is the first thing they're gonna tell the sheriff when they find I kept the whole 3,000? They won't believe that. Nobody'd believe that crazy story. Well, then... Joe, do you realize how long it would take us to save $3,000? 20 years. Maybe never. Yeah, but that has nothing to do with going out and stealing something. - I'm not... - Just please... Go into town. Think about it. And if you decide that you... That you just have to tell the sheriff... Then you bring him back here, and I'll... I'll give it to him. I'm only going into town, Nell. I'll be back in time for breakfast. Hey, where are we gonna get us another horse? Ben's place. That's 30 miles away. Must be a horse closer than that. Not for sale. Who's talking about buying? Ordinarily, it ain't my policy to look on the sorry side. But if we was to get caught, we'd probably have to do about 5 years in the penitentiary for bank robbery. Is that right? Maybe. Maybe more. Yeah. But for horse stealing, no maybe. They hang you right now. come on, you melancholy folk wherever you may be I'll sing about the cowboy whose life is light and free hey, I just thought of somethin... Benny ain't got no horses. All he's got is mules, ain't that right? That's right. You expect me to ride a goddamn mule? Well, there's nothing wrong with a good mule. You ride him, then. We're partners. We'll cut cards for the horse. What for? You said yourself ain't nothin' wrong with a good mule. That's what I said. But if, uh, Benny ain't got a good mule... I mean, a real good mule. I mean, a real good kind that there's nothin' wrong with, then we'll cut cards. All right? Yeah. who roams about the prairie at night when he lies down his heart is gay as flowers in may though his ass is on the ground All right, all right. All right! Hold your goddamn horses! Joe: Oh, Maybell, I'm sorry to disturb you maybell: Wait. Hello, Joe. I'd like to help out, honey... No, you don't understand. I'm looking for the sheriff. Well, the sheriff is... No. The bank has been robbed. Now, will you wake him up, please? I gotta get dressed. Maybell: I got money in that bank. Bill! Bill, come on, bill! Get up! Woman: What the hell's going on? Ah, shut up and get back to work! Does Walt Buckman know about this? No. Nobody does. Just me. Bill! Bill, did you hear what I said?! Maybell... will you get the hell out of there, or I'm gonna blow a big, fat hole in your door? I said the bank's been robbed! Now, you listen to me, Bill! I helped you, you son of a bitch, get to be sheriff. And I can... Aah! Maybell: Goddamn son of a bitch! Next time, you son of a bitch, I'll see you downstairs! Pull up. Whoa, whoa. Swappin' time. Oh. How much further? My butt's is frayed to a faretheewell. Oh, it's a long way. Won't get there until afternoon. What do you got? Ain't he cute? Frank, what the hell you doin' with a little pup like that? He ain't even weened. Well, I'll figure something out. All we need's a little bit of milk. Where the hell we're gonna get that? Well, Ross, I'm surprised at you. Any man who can Rob bank of $36,000 should find us a teeny little bit of milk. Sometimes, boy, you do amaze me. Don't you love me no more? Oh, I love ya. I just can't figure out what the hell to do with ya. Well, you gotta admit he is a cute one. Yeah, he's cute. I just couldn't resist it. Uh-huh. Ok. Ooh, goddamn! What's the matter? He just peed my shirt. Whoo! Ha ha ha. How long will it take you to round up a posse? Well... no. God, no. Not till, uh, 7, 8:00. They'll be long gone. Ever try to round up a posse before they've had breakfast? They can't get far with one horse. Then they'll get another horse. I want 'em caught, Bill! You've got your deputy. I'll let you take my boys. Now, the four of you ought to be able to get the job done. Listen to me. Sir? I want 'em back, you understand? Look, Walt, if I deputize your boys here, they ain't gonna have jurisdiction across that territory line. They aren't, huh? Well, no r-bar hand ever done anything like this before. And it's gonna be a cold day in hell before one even thinks about trying it again. Heh. If the sheriff has to stop, then you keep right on goin' and bring those cowboys back, you understand? Dead or alive? Alive, of course! That is, if they give you that choice. Howdy, Ben. Howdy, sergeant. Ben and me was in the army together for a spell. That ain't gonna buy you much. Ain't gonna buy your friend nothin... Good-natured veteran, ain't he? We robbed us a bank last night. My partner here's got a new little pup. Thought you might have some milk. Also, I'd like to make a deal with you for one of them mules. Ha ha ha ha. Ross: Climb down. Ha ha ha ha. It's all right, darlin'. It won't be long now. Yeah. You still good, Ben? Pretty good. Good as you used to be? My legs ain't. Hands is. If I had to come around all of a sudden-like, I'd end up in a heap. But if I'm facin' it to start with... Hey, you scared the hell out of my dog. Maybe you'd like to try your hand. I gave up shootin' bottles and tin cans when I was rich enough to buy my own bullets. It's all right, darlin... Uh, maybe you'd like to teach us old-timers a few new tricks. I can think of one trick you might be interested in. Which one is that? The one where you hurry up get my dog milk, or I step on you where it hurts. The trick is you can't do nothin' about it, 'cause you wasted all your bullets shootin' a bunch of stupid bottles. What do you say, sergeant? I make it a point never to argue with an animal lover. You can have all the milk I got. There's your milk. That's a cat. Yeah. Whatever it is, you want some milk, that's where it's gonna get. She'll take his head off. It might not. I heard about a bitch wolf that suckled a skunk once. I remember, in Virginia, fox raised a litter of hounds. Aw, Bodine, I don't... You want that pup to live, you ain't got no choice. Now give here. The cat knows me. Here you are, kitty. Look what I got you here. New customer. Hey, look at that. I'll be damned. Tell you what... You give me the pup, and I'll give you the... Oh, no, you don't. You ain't gettin' that pup. - How you gonna feed it? - Uh, he's got a point. I don't care... Trade you for my best mule. No! You ain't gonna find no mule 'tween here and mile city. Heh. That's a 3 good days' ridin' on 2 good horses. We need that mule. I need that dog. I'll give you $20 for the cat. - Oh, for Christ's sake. - It ain't for sale. $30. Let's have some coffee. How you gonna carry a cat? You carry the cat. I got the dog. What will you take for the cat? Well, what you're sayin' is, then, if you don't get the dog, we don't get the mule, huh? That's right. Frank: Give him the dog! I'll ride the mule. That's best for everyone, especially the dog. Thanks for everything. Be seein' ya, Ben. Bye, sergeant. Don't you worry, Sonny. I'll take good care of the pup. You do that, old-timer. Let's go! Come on, Bodine! They should be in Wyoming by now. Yup. Close enough so we ain't gonna catch'em 'fore they are. We're going back right now. Yeah. We might as well, too, John. We're not cut out for this kind of work. The old man said he wanted 'em brought in. You want to go back, you tell him that's what I'm doin'. All right. Give him some grub and tobacco. Don't be such a damn fool. Now, them boys, they can be in Mexico, Indian territory, god knows. Now, ain't that right, sheriff? That's right. That's a long way, John. Then I better get going, huh? Heh heh. Comin'? What you gonna do when you get born in the wrong family, huh? Come on. - Kind of spooky. - Yeah. Yeah, they haven't been grazing too well. Put an extra man on each guard. Yeah. That's a good idea. If anything goes wrong, send someone in for me. Otherwise, I'll see you bright and early. Want somebody to ride back with you? What for? Nothin... You can make me that offer after about 6 more birthdays, and not before. Whatever you say, Mr. Buckman. I say, "up yours." Did he really send them 2 boys after Bodine and Post? Well, if he did, it ain't any of your business. Damned fool thing to do if you ask me. Nobody asked you. Somebody's bound to end up dead or crawlin' around, wishin' he was. Should've left it alone. The sheriff could've handled it. They worked with him, and they stole his money. A man like Buckman ain't gonna let a thing like that alone. You still want to go on with this? They're no better off than we are. Now what kind of stupid argument is that now, huh? Just 'cause they're drowning or freezing to death, that ain't no reason we got to do the same. Now, is it? I aim to get 'em, Paul. You got to start thinking like a reasonable human being for a change. Well, that's our goddamn money. We just ain't got no right. Pa told me to do something, I'm gonna do it. Now, you want to go on back, just get the hell out of here or get the hell off my back! Hey, Frank. Wake up. You see what I see? Broncs. So what? Well, that means I'm through ridin' a mule. Are you crazy? You gonna catch yourself a horse? Who the hell's gonna break him? Who the hell do you think? Come on, saddle up the mule. Ross, we can't stay here for... It ain't gonna take that long. Come on! Goddamn! Jesus Christ. Hold still, you jerk-headed mule. Stay. Come. Ok. Let's go. Come on, now let's go. Here we go now. Come on. Stupid! You dumb son of a... Come on, now. Let's go! Ohh, goddamn! Stop it. Stupid... Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on. Yee-haw! Come on, mule, run. Yee-haw! Yee-haw! Go get him, Ross! Go get him! Whoo! I got him, Ross I got him! I got him! Aw, shit! No, I don't. Frank: Yee-ooh! Yee-ooh! Ross: Shut up and hold on. Ross: Whoa, you bitch. - Whoa. - Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Whoa, ho. Whoa. Frank: Whoa now. Ross: Watch your head there. Easy. Now hold her, Frank. I'll get her tied up. Hold her. - Now watch it! - Whoa, whoa. Whoa now! Whooooa! All right, let me take her. I'm-a go get the saddle. You silly girl. Ho now. Ho now. Ho now. Ho now. Easy, Daisy. Easy. Whoa. Whoa. Keep bitin' on that ear. Keep bitin'. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa, girl. Ok, you can let her go now. Ho now, Daisy. Ho. How come Daisy? First girl I was ever in love with - when I was about 8. - Heh. She was a sweet little thing. You think this one's just as sweet? She's gonna be. All right, Daisy, this is where you and I get engaged. Ok, let's do it! All right. Show me something. Ok, Ross. Stay with it. Beautiful! That's it, stay on her, Ross. I bet you didn't have so much trouble when you was 8. Stay on her! Hold on to her! That's it! That's it! Ride her now. Ride her! Waltz with the lady. Waltz with her. Whoo! You're doin' it! You're doin' it! Hang onto her now! Hold her, Ross! Hold her! Ride her! Waltz with the lady. Whoo! Yee-whoo! Yee-haw! Yee-haw! Yee-whoo! Yee-haw! Yee-haw! Yee-whoo! Yee-haw! Yee-haw! Yee-whoo! Ho, ho, ho, lover. God damn. What'd I tell ya? Whoo! Ross: saddle me up with an old gray hack with a big wide seat right on his back they padded him up good with a gunny sack with my beddin' on when I got on, he left the ground went up in the air and turned around and I busted the earth when I came down both: oh, what a terrible fall now in the mornin' if you don't die I'll give you another horse to try oh, can't ya let me walk, says I oh, yes, says he, to town both: now I've lived in cities and I've lived in towns I've traveled this country all around one thing to say before you start kiss your wife insure your life kill yourself with a pocketknife I swear that's the best way Ross: I wanna show you somethin... Easy now, girl. Easy now. Ho now. Ho now. Ho. Ya see. Plum gentle. Oh! Ain't that just like a woman though? Always gotta have the last word. Ross: You know, it's growed a bit since I seen it last. Yeah, well, seein' how you already been to Benson... Tell ya what. We'll draw straws to see who goes in. Now who's gonna hold the straws? Why, hell, there're only 2 straws. You can't cheat. We'll cut cards. And you're gonna shuffle? Now whoever goes in has gotta buy a new deck of cards 'cause these feel like they been soaked in honey. I ain't gonna look at mine yet. Now don't you look at yours either. Ok, you wanna trade? - You don't trust me. - Nope. Well, the feeling is mutual. Ok, then let's trade. Nope. You sure? Ok, let's trade. Ok, now what I got is yours. What you got is mine, right? That's right. Ok. 8 of spades. 2 of diamonds. God damn! Now what we need is some grub and some tobacco... And a new deck of cards. How much you think I ought to take with me? How the hell should I know? Take what you need. Take the whole goddamn thing for all I care. Don't make no goddamn bit of difference to me. Now look... You're just lucky that you have to stay behind because I gotta go in there and face all that temptation. Now there's nothin' il can do about that. I'll only be about an hour or 2. Boy, I sure don't see why we gotta be so almighty careful. I'd rather get caught than go on like this. 3 weeks. 3 miserable goddamn weeks. A man could just... What's up? Well, I just figure it's liable to be a long time before we hit another town, and in the meantime, bitchin' to me all the way to Mexico. So why don't we take a little bit of this and spend it... And raise some hell? Whoo! Pardner, I'm gonna shoot the first man says you ain't got style. And I'm gonna shoot the first woman. Sure has changed a bit. Hey, what're we gonna do first? Find us a big bathtub. You get a couple more buckets now, son, you hear? - Hey, Frank. - Mmm? Man gets into civilization like this, he hardly knows what to do first. Frank: Thank you. Barber: You're welcome. Will there be anything else, sir? Yeah. I want yato go out and buy these supplies I've listed. Mm-hmm. What time is it? 7 minutes after 1:00, exactly. All right. Wake me up at 6:00. Just check on me every once in a while to see I haven't drowned. Ahh! Sure thing. I'll be back soon as I can now, son. You take care of 'em. Yes, pa. Is that ok? Perfect. Oh. Hey, Ross. What d'ya think the poor folks is doin'? Without. Yeah. What's up, Brad? Look over on that hill. Well, can't say I didn't give 'em fair warnin'. Better get your guns out 'cause they're gonna shoot you whether you got 'em out or not. I ain't gonna get you killed. Yaaah! The old man can go straight to hell. This just don't make no sense to me, John. Keepin' on like this. We don't even know if we're headin' the right direction. I'm leavin' you at the next town, little brother. What's the next town? Oh, god, I don't know. It's probably Benson. I don't know. Benson. Hey, you. You asleep? dah dum, dah hmm hmm dah, hmm hmm dah Dee Dee Hey, Ross, you busy? What's up? Uh, well, nothin' right now. I'm gonna go play some poker. Wanna play? I think I'll just stay right here. Good luck. See ya in the mornin... See ya in the mornin... Well, I'm gonna play some cards first. Howdy. I see an extra chair. Can I sitin? - Sure. - Thank you. All right. I can open. I'll see your 5 and raise you 5. Cerveza. All right, boys. Takes Jacks or better. All right, young man. $20. Ahem. Hmm. All right. I'll see that. Your 20... And I'll raise you 20. I call. You call? No. I'm raisin' you. Looks like the boy's got somethin... Well, let him get it said then. 20... 40 more. Well, now you know somethin'? I believe him so I'm just gonna fold 'cause I ain't got doodly-shit. 60 to me, huh? Ruff? Call. Pat. Uh, 2. - Dealer: In? - 2. Ok, dealer takes 3. So, what're you gonna do? I'm gonna bet 100. I'll see ya. What're you doin', Ruff? There's your 100... And 100 better. Dealer: Beats me. 100... And 200 more. I'm out. Ain't got that much. How much you got? 105. 65. You fellers know each other? That's a bet. You called. Man: Lay 'em down. Full barn. 7s, full of Jacks. You cheated me! Don't shoot me. Jesus Christ. Frank! No, I ain't got nothin... Now the next son of a bitch that moves... Dealer: I don't think the bartender was gonna shoot ya. Why the fuck didn't he put out a sign?! Some kinda poker game. How bad you hurt? I'm ok. I'm bleedin... Take this. I'll be back. You want me to get ya adoctor? No, I don't need no doctor. You could pick up my winnin's. I think you'll find that it's correct. You sure you don't want me to get the doctor? Thank you. Good luck. God... Damn. I should've stuck with what I was doin... Frank: What are you doin'? I'm gonna give her $100. Now you take good care, darlin'. You'll pay for that. I'm bleedin' to death, and you're givin' away our money. Come on, come on. Yah! Come on. I'd like to talk to the sheriff. Go right ahead. My name's Paul Buckman. Me and my brother here come in from Montana. Yeah, I know who you are. How you know? Ah, sheriff Jackson sent word. Y'all get on down and come in the office. I wanna talk to ya. Ok. Man: Let not your hearts be troubled. If ye believe in god, believe also in me. In my father's house there are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. If I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself... Paul: We better get on back, little brother. John: No. He told us to do something, we better do it. Mama's gonna be needing us. The last thing pa said was bring Frank Post and Ross Bodine back. I aim to do it if it takes me the rest of my life. He was a man by the name of yost. Ruff Yost. He's a no-good son of a bitch. He drew down on Post, and I guess when he did, all hell busted loose, 'cause when it was all over there was 3 men and a woman dead. That sounds like self-defense to me. Yeah, but a reliable witness, he, uh, he don't think Bodine oughta got that bartender 'cause, uh... Then there's that little matter of bank robbin', you know. Paul: Johnny! Johnny. Go home. Ain't got to prove nothin' no more, John. This ain't up to us. They was r-bar men, they stole r-bar money. Aw, hell, John. They stole circle-c money and lazy-w money and they stole half the money in town. You're talking about r-bar money, he said it'd be a cold day in hell before anyone tries again. But he don't mean nothin' now, John. He's dead, John-boy. No, he ain't, Paul. We're the ranch now, you and me. You understand that? How you doin'? You wanna stop? No. Not much longer till dark. Ross: Have another drink. Now, Frank, relax, 'cause I don't want you jerking while I'm gettin' this thing out. Ain't there a better way to do this? I wish there were, partner. Oh, come on! God damn it, I haven't even started! Have another drink. Come on! Come on, drink it all, god damn it. I don't wanna have to hit you in the head. Oh, god damn. Hold on. Oh, god, Ross! God damn, Ross! God... de... ro... ohh! God, Ross! God damn it, lie down! Aah! Damn it, come out of there, you son of a bitch! Uhh. Ohh! Sure wish I felt like things were gonna be... Just dandy. They crossed here, I'd say, sometime this morning. Well, that's the Utah line. You... y'all gonna go ahead? So long, sheriff. Ahem. Listen, son, why don't you turn around and come go back with us, and maybe he'll give it up after a while? Nah. He'll... he'll either bring 'em back, or he'll die trying. I don't care much for him lately, but I think I'd rather see him bring 'em back. Hoo, John! Thanks, sheriff. Come on, boys. Let's go home. Paul: Little brother! I know it ain't too appetizing, but you oughta try to eat something. It ain't that I don't admire your cooking, Ross, but tonight I think I'm just gonna have too pass. How 'bout a drink? I couldn't handle that, either. Christ, you're sick. Probably dying. Heh. You're burnin' up. I'm so cold, I can't stop shakin... Let's take another look at that leg. It's not so good, huh? No, it ain't so bad. Hell it ain't. If it hurts worse, you can cut it off and I'll kiss you for doin' it. Ok, it's infected. We gotta get you to a doctor. Yeah, there's one right over the next hill. Heh. And he's got 2 beautiful daughters. Hey, wouldn't that just be... That'd be just as good as you could get, huh? We'd better be headin' back for Benson. What happens if we keep goin'? Well, this is awful big territory. Not many people around. Bound to run into somebody sooner or later, but I wouldn't guarantee it wasn't later than sooner. Well, we made it this far. I guess I can make it the rest of the way. It's too big a gamble, Frank. It's my gamble. It's my gamble, and I'll bet you $1,000 we find us a town quicker than it would take us to get back to Benson. Ok. I mean, I don't wanna bet you, but if you wanna do it that way, that's the way we'll do it. Now, if you need anything, just holler, huh? Hey, Ross. - Yeah? - Hey, Ross. You wanna stop? I don't wanna stop. I feel... Easy, partner. Hold on. Hold on, partner. Aah! Think I'll ever see Mexico? Why, hell, yes. After all this, it better be as good as you say. It's better. I just didn't want to tell you too much. Uh, afraid you'd get too anxious. Tell me now. Well, uh, a lot of it you know. Tell me again. It's green. Yeah. Yeah, it's green most of the year. Uh, lots of grass, plenty of water. We can run us 1,000 or 2,000 head if we wanted to, but, uh, that kind of spread spells work, and I figure we've done enough of that. We'll just get us a few mex cattle just to keep our hands in. But once we get that real fine hacienda built, plenty of people to do the work and the cleaning up, you and I are gonna take it easy. Whoa, now. And I tell you, some of those mexicana girls are just about as pretty as you'll ever wanna see. Yes, sir, Frank. I give you my personal word of honor that if there's one place in this whole world where a cowboy can kick off his spurs and be happy for the rest of his life, that's where we're going. So hang on, partner. It ain't much farther. Well, I guess by now you got me figured out as someone that don't surprise too easy, for one thing, and I ain't the most superstitious bronc crasher in the world, for another. But I tell you, Frank. The more it goes, the more I see every day, the less I wouldn't swear that we ain't really got much to say about it. Maybe it's all been figured out up front. And except for a couple of measly detours, which is left to us to make it seem like we're really calling the shots, we're just doin' what was decided the day we popped into this old world. 'Cause, hell, look at us. Now, honestly, you ever seen a more unlikely combination? Now, who the hell would figure us throwing in together? I remember the first day you came to work for the r-bar. Talkin' like a windy texan, actin' like a clown, and wearing that silly-assed hard-boiled derby. And I decided that just about everything about you wasn't my style. And I made a calculation on you faster than I ever made one before or since, and I gave you just one week. Just goes to show you how wrong a man can be. Just goes to show that when it comes to something special, like lovin' a woman or judgin' a man, man just don't know shit. A week later, we was walkin' around each other. A month later, we was swappin' lies. And a year later, we was robbin' us a bank. I guess I started out hating your healthy young guts... 'Cause it was mostly all behind for me and mostly all ahead for you. Anyway, for what it's worth... You turned out to be one goddamn fine cowboy. Be seein' you, partner. all you wild rovers you listen to me wanna tell you the tale of my sad history I'm a cowboy of fortune a lover of life too old for a sweetheart too young for a wife I've drunk me some whiskey and roped me a steer I've busted wild broncos my clothes, they are ragged my language is tough but a sweet-lovin' woman can smooth out the rough oh, I've tasted it all and I'm tellin' you, men if I had me the chance jj» I'd sure do it again but the days are much shorter and winter is nigh sooner or later a man's gonna die so drink to the rovers the last of their kind they're wild and they're woolly and out of their minds just a few more tomorrows they won't be around forgotten by all 6 feet in the ground Yah! Come on! You son of a... Bodine, I'm sorry. Me, too. He was mine, you son of a bitch. He was mine, Paul. Help me take him back, Paul. John: I've gotta... Gotta take him back! You gotta help me, Paul. Gotta help me take him back, Paul. Stand up... Stand up, you son of a bitch. All right. All right? I got him, pa. Look what I got! Look what I got. I done what you told me, pa. Pa? Paul... Paul! Get Ross Bodine... Gotta take him... Take him back... I gotta see... Uhh. I did what you want. Paul... help me. Uhh... Paul... Frank: Beautiful! That's it, stay on her, Ross. Boy, I bet you didn't have this much trouble when you was 8. Stay on her, Ross. Stay on her! Hold onto her! That's it! Ride her, now, ride her! Waltz with the lady. Waltz with her. Whoo! You're doin' it! You're doin' it! Hang onto her, now! Hold her, Ross! Hold her! Ride her! Waltz with the lady. Whoo!
