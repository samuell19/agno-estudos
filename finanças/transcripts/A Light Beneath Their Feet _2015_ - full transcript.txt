Claim to me that this city's so tired. Then you fall over laughing from the late night. So nothing's promised or ever guaranteed to last. Held my breath, but you're fading fast. Say it slowly. You still shine like a diamond. I felt it through me. Whisper to me that you've had enough. Apologize that you're not in love. If it's just the chemicals in our brains. Slow, stay. Everybody seems to say the same thing. I was in too deep. I was over my head. No, no, no, no. Mom! Mom! Mom! I'm right here. I thought you wanted a normal job. What? Why be normal when you can be fabulous? You might even like this job better than one at the bakery. I don't know about that. Oh, Northwestern, would you look at that. So you think Northwestern can handle a Gerringson girl? Untamed, uncivilized? So glad you're staying close next year. It's going to be so great. Yeah. So you're going to run out of those little blue pills next Wednesday when I go to Dad's, so you're going to have to get more. OK? OK. Yes, sir. You know, I can take care of myself. I know. I love you. I love you. From another road you looked in my soul, lying out the doorway. Feeling that I would be writing on the sorrow when you go to drive away. Hey. Thank you. Have the best, OK? OK I hope you get a really good job, Mom. Me, too. Bye. Bye, drive safe. Careful you might lose your virginity. One week before the AP exam and everyone's reading. "His needs are from a place of pain. Mine from an even darker place. There is only one position--" Homemade smut, how retro. Put it away. Beth Gerringson, care to give this one a try? Less than one. You're right actually. Can I go to the bathroom or-- or somewhere. The bathroom or somewhere pass is taken. You'll have to wait for Amy to get back. All right, so if you will come this way, Gloria. Hi, Amy. This is Gloria, one of our student specialist. Right here. Obviously, if you see this is, of course, our steaming area. Very dangerous. Awfully hot. So be very careful. All right, so we step this way please. Maria and Cindy, this is Gloria. Hi. She starts today. All right, now before I leave you to your own devices here. I have just one more thing I want to explain. Fourth and fifth periods, that's our rush time, so for those two hours, you can't take any breaks or what have you. Now, what is or what have you? What? Exactly. What? Have you? What? Have you. No. It's a joke. Oh Look, they don't really tell me much about why you're in the program. OK, now I only ask you this because the last one we got from your agency, up and urinated on the floor one day, so I just need to know, are you good for this job? Yes. Yeah. OK. OK. Good. Oh, one more thing, health regs, so no jewelry. OK. Got it. Good. Make yourself at home. OK. I-- I can't hold it. Thank you for bringing back the pass. Don't wet your pants, Beth. Beth, hi. Hey, Beth, can you give me a ride from school today? OK. You know I didn't have a choice, Beth, OK? I mean, I wanted something completely different. But if I turn down jobs, then you start losing the benefits. It's all connected. They check your email. And that's not paranoia, because I read that in the Tribune. So it's like I had to take what they gave me. I'm glad you have a job, Mom. Good news is that there's only three weeks left of school. Thank god. You know I did my last week of school. Please, don't gross me out. Oh, it's so not gross. Your conception was beautiful. I was nuts about Paul. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Go, go. I want to get off my meds. Why do you want to go off your meds? Why do I want to go off my meds, Gloria? Hm, so I can feel like myself. Because I'm really tired of being down and moving slow. What would happen if you went off your meds? Let's think this through. I hate when you ask me that. Well, think it through. I risk losing Beth again. Can I read what you wrote about me in your book, please? Sure. Taking care of yourself, hm. Taking medicine consistently, yep, check. Why are you smiling? You love it when I read out of this book, don't you? Hey, it is classic behavior, which I do find interesting. Cause you love the crazies. Beth going to college next door is a catastrophe. Yeah. Beth going away will be a catastrophe. She won't be doing my meds. And will she need new clothes. And she won't be yelling down the stairs. She's moving next door. I know, but then what if she gets a job after college far away? What if she gets married? Why do I have to be on my meds if she's just going to be gone. Happy 3rd Birthday Elleven? That can't be right. That's the name. 11 with two Ls? It's pronounced Elleven. Stop making that cake. Elleven's parents have to be stopped. No, no, no-- Hi. Hey. Hello, do you want something? Yeah, just a soda or something. So just out roaming the streets? Just thirsty, man. Oh, um-- um-- I'm so sorry. I must have shaken it up. That's cool. See ya. What? What is that? Stop that. What? It's not how you look. He's a socio and a weird. He's just different. Different? Beth, he had sex with a teacher. He was a victim. It's going to be short. Why? Chadworthy, he didn't pay. Turns out he's also a thief. We're going to get fired over a $1.89. I'm not getting fired. You're not paying for that. Yes, I am. You just bought Jeremy Chadworthy a drink? That's great. Good yellow tail nothing? Yes. It tastes like a scrotum. The word of the day is filicide. It's the act of killing one's own parents. Filicide. Well, remarkably patient complaints of emotional flatlining on lithium has led to an increase in the use of off label anti-convulsants for bipolar disorder. Yes. Indeed. There's an argument to be made that bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and chronic depression should be treated as neurological disorders and not psychiatric ones. Well, Daschulla, to give these people to the neurologists would be to ignore the emotional toll that these illnesses reap on the patient. What about Alzheimer's disease? I mean, that has huge emotional components for the patient. But it's classified as a neurological disorder. Those folks really suffer. And that's just the disease. Then they have to deal with the neurologist? Oh, stop it. You're terrible. Hey, my brother is a neurologist. And look at the emotional toll that's had on you. Sorry, I must have shaken it up. I do not like this uniform. It's going to feel normal in a few days. This-- this is going to feel normal in a few days? No, it's never going to feel normal, Beth, because I'm not supposed to be a lunch lady. OK? Just-- just give it a chance, OK? Just try-- for me, please? Hey, listen, I-- I'm not going to tell any of the students that I'm you're mom, OK? OK, but it's not a secret. But thanks. Oh. You look good. Stop fussing with it. OK. All right, bye. Bye. Have a good day. You, too. Come on, Mom. Stop. OK, love you. I love you. Drive safely, OK? OK. Any update, Gerringson? Still deciding. Will you at least let me know if you got in? I got in. So you're staying local. Northwestern, very good school. Yeah, OK, bye. My bullshit meter is going off. Dr. Krolly, no offense, but the only reason I asked you to write my rec letter to Northwestern is because I never talk in your class, so I thought you would write me a bad letter and I wouldn't get it. You don't want to go to Northwestern? Where do you want to go? I want to go to UCLA. California, why? The weather here is always changing and you just never know what to expect. But in California it's always the same except for very predictable weather patterns, which you can easily prepare for. And that's where I want to live. Did you get in? Who doesn't want you to go to UCLA? Mom or dad? Or step mom? Or two dads or whomever? They don't even know I applied. Promise me something. So I know I made a little difference today. What? When you really want something, go for it, even if it only makes sense to you. Two tickets to prom. I want to go to prom. Usually the guy buys the ticket. Like a guy who likes you. And don't say you're a lesbian, because we know who all the lesbians are. Just give me the tickets, please. Who's your date? We could guess, but we can't-- Because you don't have a boyfriend. And we know everyone who has a boyfriend. And you don't, so-- Jeremy Chadworthy. Don't you know about him? He's damaged. He slept with his junior high homeroom teacher. It was on the news. And now she's incarcerated for a long time. He put his first girlfriend in jail He doesn't even live in Evanston. He only goes here because legally he can't go to the same schools as her messed up kids since that would be distracting. I'm going to prom with Jeremy Chadworthy. Get your fresh fruit, out of the can, right here, right now. We have cherries, pineapples, melons. Hey, bud, how are you today? I'm OK, I guess. Just OK, you guess? Yeah. Why are you great? Greatness. All right, bye. Ahem. Are you having an off day? Am I? Uh, huh. I'm fine today. Yeah? Yeah. OK, well, then let's keep the line moving, OK? Oh, yeah, absolutely. Joe, will you help me out here? Oh, yeah, gotcha. OK. You are the cause and I will run. Deliver me from fruit cocktail! It's going to rain. I can-- I can feel it. I can feel in my fingertips. It's going to rain. It's cloudy and humid, that means it's going to rain. No, no, it's not that. It's-- it's-- oh, it's that edge of your seat feeling. You know? You're like. You know, like when you know something is going to happen. But that's even better than when it does happen, because-- what I would really love right now would be a storm, a huge storm with thunder and just lightning. Oh, that would be so great. Wouldn't that be great? Beth. Hello? Just a minute. Damn. I want to hear song. It's got to be on this station. Nope. You know, I was thinking maybe I could go just a little bit further away for school. No, no, no. What do you mean no? I take medication so I can take care of you. That's my favorite thing to do. I don't want to be-- I don't I don't want to be on medication. That's like-- that's-- not being on medication is my other favorite thing to do besides, well, after taking care of you. So what's the point? You like to do other things. I do you like to do other things. That's right. You like to do other things other than take care of me. I like to sing. I like to paint. I-- I-- I'm always happy when you're around. But I half the time I'm so funny from the lithium that-- I don't know-- I can't even do any of that. RESTAURANT WORKER Sorry about the wait. What can I get for you? Can I get a-- Hi. Can you hear me? Um-- a super dog. Hey, why don't we go inside? I don't want to go inside. Why would I go inside when you're here? OK, come on. Come on, let's go inside. No. Yeah. No, no, no. Look how many people are in there. We don't need to go inside. We always in the car. Why-- why would you want to go inside when we've always eaten in the care together? Why are you changing everything when I'm about to have the biggest change in my life with you-- you leaving to Northwestern. I mean, you're kidding right? Right? See I have a feeling you're not kidding. It was just an idea. So you're staying? I'm not going to swallow another pill just knowing that you're going to leave. Mom? What is it? Do you approve an online payment to Northwestern admissions? Didn't I send the payment to UCLA? That was last week. This week she's going to Northwestern. You said that I could go wherever I wanted. You said that I could make the choice myself. The choice to go to one school. Not put deposits in everywhere. You don't understand, this is your chance. You have to create your own life. Or she'll-- she'll take all of it. Dad, stop. I'm sorry, it's just that a few days ago I thought you were going to UCLA, even though you didn't tell me, you were applying. I know, I'm sorry. Hey, I like that you didn't tell me. Look, I want you to do what you want. Leaving her is not the worst thing you can do. Leave both deposits. It's against the rules. Break the rules for me, OK, kiddo? But that's it. No more-- just break that one rule. And then we're good, right. That's quite a bit of-- OK, but what shape? What shape? Tell me? A heart. A bigger one. So much love. Oops The whistle blowing, the command is on the phone. Oh, my god, Mom, you got to try a strawberry. Mm, so good. I thought of something. You want to go to our favorite place? Maybe. Maybe? Maybe. Please, don't you need something. I have no needs. Come on, Bethie sunshine. I don't have any needs. You do actually, because what's this? What? Me, me, me, me. Stop. Darling. Yes? Shoes. The teal heel. I will take a right heel and a left gold. We can only sell shoes in pairs, of course. What? Well, then we'll take one of everything. And you can charge that to Paul Hutchins. My one true love who left me for another. She's just kidding. Sort of. Plus, this. Thank you. When you go to Northwestern, you can come here in the afternoons and get our faces made up like whores. Mom, you can't say that. You're my hand me down Jane. I'm your warranty. My mouth on yours too. Good night. What's wrong? I just-- I don't feel good. You don't? I know. It's OK. It's the lights. It's just the lights, kid. They make everybody crazy. Let's go. Wouldn't it be easier to pour the new ones on top? Yes, but that wouldn't be proper stock rotation. Yeah, but I'd be so much easier. Shut up, OK. I'm going to Northwestern. And that's a good school. So get off my back. OK. Um-- thank you for sharing. But you'll be around. That's good. Um-- I will also be around seeing as I go to a school in my living room. And perhaps I don't know that many girls, but I know enough to think you're one of quality. And so am I. There's like all this stuff inside me that you can't even imagine and-- I'm not being-- I'm not being gross. It's cool stuff. Like I have a collection of bottle caps that tells the history of the American West. Hey, can you boil this down to like one thing? Um, yeah. Beth, do you want to see my bottle cap collection some time? That's a real thing? Yeah. Oh, gosh, this guy. Thirsty? Don't drink that. Yeah, but do you forget to pay for it. Oh. Ooh, he's got a lot of stops on the tambourine tour. Yeah, but he came back. That's a sign. Yeah, a sign that says, stay away, Beth. He forgot his change. Something for the tip jar. What? Can you close up? Me? In charge? Yes, you can do it. Hey! Hey, wait! I walk in with my hands on my hips and a home-made whiskey twist. I am just what you want, but I can't tell you what that is. And I don't plan on nothing' that you can't fit in bottles. And that changes how this all works out. Hi. Hey. Do you want to go to prom with me? What? You and I, we're just-- I think we're both different. I mean, we're different than everyone else. And-- and I know that you're complicated because I'm-- I'm complicated too. It's just no one at this school knows that. And I already bought the tickets, so you don't even have to pay for anything, because I already bought the tickets. So do you want to go with me? I don't really go to school stuff. But uh-- see you around? Very nice. Blech. I-- Here you go. Leave me alone, bitch. Hi, I am-- have a prescription. Gerringson. Gerringson. Gerring-- might still be in the box. You tried to steal my shampoo. I saw you try to take it three times. I did. I'm not going to pay for it. Here they are. Miss Gerringson. We want to thank you for this time with Beth. She has been such a blessing. And we want to thank you for this bounty that we are so excited to share with-- so excited to share with one another and that we are and each other's lives-- Should I get the door, or is God going to do it? Honey. Is that baby world? Yeah. I waited all day. And they show up at 7:30. Wow, that's rough. Hi. Hello. Yes, can you just take that right upstairs. You can assemble it in the first bedroom at the top of the stairs. Sure thing. Why is the crib going in my room? That's going to be the baby's room. But-- why can't it just go in the guest room? Because the baby's not a guest. Plus, Julie's mom is going to stay with us for a few weeks when the baby comes. Right. So when is this baby coming? September 1st. That will be when you're starting school. Oh, have you decided between Northwestern and UCLA? You told Julie? I-- uh-- didn't know it was a secret. You don't have to tell her everything. And no, Julie, I'm not going to California. I'm going to stay right here in Evanston, where I've been my whole life, and where I'm going to die. Well before you die, I think you owe Julie here an apology. Sorry. How is she? You know how she is? Yeah, well she's got a lot going on in her head. What was she like before? Before when? Before she was diagnosed? OK, just forget it. Why? It's just the way you say it. What? Diagnosed, it sounds so mean. She-- she was very excited. She had all these ideas and stories. And then she just started like doing things. Her plans-- I didn't know what was going on. And then she took you with her on that trip. Yeah, but she didn't hurt me. She just didn't tell you what she was doing. So I never understood what the big deal was. Well, she got the help she needs. So. Do you think you would still be with her if she wasn't bipolar. It would have turned out a lot easier if it had been the flu. I think if you decide to love someone you can see who they really are, even if they have problems. Maybe we've just been looking at this for way too long. No, it's good. It's good. Oh, one second, Dad. Yep. I totally forgot it's your night away from home. But do you think you could come home tonight? Maybe go there another night? Yeah, sure. Oh, god, it's so good. I feel so much better. I went to the pharmacy tonight and this old lady, she growled at me, Beth, like literally. And then I'm thinking I want to wear more make up. I just do. I want to wear more make up, and not just on special occasions. So next time we go to the mall, can we pick some up? OK, so did you actually get your meds? No, uh, uh, nope, I had to get out of there. So you went, but you didn't actually get your meds? No but I'll. I'll go next time in the day, when it's not so scary. Go right after your appointment with Dr. Rutter. OK, I will. What time will you be home? You know, I really want to stay here tonight, like I'm supposed to OK? OK. That's fine. OK. All right, well, I'll just go home and make some soup, and I'll do the laundry. And yeah, I'll just read a book. I heard Beth Gerringson thinks you're taking her to prom. Really? Are you? I don't go to school stuff. OK. Well, I'm just saying it because she only wants to take you because it's controversial. Yeah, you're probably right. I know some stuff about Beth. When she was five, her mom kidnapped her. What? She took her to the Grand Canyon via Greyhound. Didn't bother telling anyone about her big idea, because she thought that no one would understand. The police had to pick them up in Colorado. And then they dropped her off in the state hospital for a long time. What's wrong with her? She is bipolar type 1 with a history of psychosis, paranoia, and an anxiety disorder for a chaser. That's a lot of stuff. Yeah, she was like my dad's favorite little project. He rescued her from the loony bin. She even got custody back when Beth was 12. My dad's testimony at her trial is what sealed the deal. The irony of him judging her fit for parenthood. Hey. You know, you fuck like a man, but you giggle like a little boy. What? I got to go. What? Why? Why are you leaving? Is that why you didn't want to go to prom? Because of Daschulla? It's more like the people at school don't really like me, because of some stuff that happened. That stuff with your teacher. I-- I'm sorry. It wasn't your fault. And it shouldn't define the rest of your life. Let's swing. Want to jump? Yeah. Ready? One. Two. Three. Three. What do you see after Evanston High? I can't believe I'm going to be older than I am right now. It's blank. A house? Kids? Anything? You want kids? I take care of my mom. That's enough. Yeah. Close your eyes. This is what I want. This is what I think about. I wish that the sun was inside of the Earth so that the sun would come from within the ground. And it would be warm all the time. And there would never be night. There'd be no darkness. Our feet would always be warm. Well, I got to go. Yeah. Mom. Mom. Mom. Hey. I think-- I think I might be in love. I'm so going to get my meds today, because I got a feeling-- I feel like I need my meds, because I have that excited feeling where I feel like something's going to happen, but then it happens, but then you're there experiencing it. OK, great. Did you here me? I think I might like a guy. You have a boyfriend? Well, I mean maybe. Really? Maybe. Who? Jeremy Chadworthy. Jeremy Chadworthy. Mm. You missed your blue pill last night and this morning. You go to go to the pharmacy before work. Oh, there's no time. There's no time for that. OK, fine, but i you start to feel weird, call me. Or even just leave work and go to the pharmacy. OK. Good plan. That's solid. Solid, solid, solid plan. Ahem, let's stick to the recommended allowance. All right? Oh, OK. I'll be more sparing with my cream. The song may swoon when the spring brings the sound. I'll finally sleep. I'll finally feel better when the winter's come, feel better when the winter's come I feel better when the winter's come. Jeremy! Jeremy! You guys know that I have a daughter that goes to this school? Oh, you have a daughter here. . Yes. And she's going to be going to Northwestern next year. That is a very good school. Yeah, I know. That's what I tell here. Do you guys have kids? Two boys. Yeah, I'm just going to miss when she-- uh-- she has this thing when she gets tired and she pulls on her ear. She's done it ever since she was a little girl. And I remember because-- well, I lost her at one time. But I got her back. Hey. Man, yeah, I'm going to miss her a lot. It's very hard. You think so? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, were you talking to your boyfriend? So, Beth, so I'm thinking after my therapy, I'm going to walk to the pharmacy. Because that's the best plan. What do you think? Were you talking to your boyfriend? Get in the car, please. Can you just watch your feet a little bit for me. Yes. And I'm thinking it would be better to sit right like that. That looks so good. This is-- yep. Looking at you, the brain. And I'm thinking, so that way you can see your patients' better when we talk, more light. Yeah. How do I look? Now you can see me. This is just what I needed. I'm concerned you may be experiencing some breakthrough mania. Trade seats with me. Let's talk about increasing your olanzapine and clonazepam and lithium. Yes, let's. Because when you're on lithium you can't have any more kid, so when one grows up and they leave you, you're shit outta of luck. Lithium, it's great. Our priority is to contain the mania. I know because I'm just a lunch lady and you're the boss, applesauce. Gloria. Yes. Trade seats with me. Gloria. Trade seats with me. Hey, you're not watching. I'm watching. Pharmacy. Doctor. Patient is Gerringson, Gloria. Rutter. DA number is 6552502. Increase by 300 mg per day. 900 in the morning. I think a storm is coming. I really do. Do you feel it? Yeah. What-- whoa. Come feel it. So you'll take the higher doses. And we'll see how you feel in a few days. Do I have to? Because I'm right on the edge. And I feel perfect. Perfect. We agreed to stay away from the edge, right? We aim for a stable. Stable? Yeah, stable. Well, I better be getting to the drugstore. Now that you ruined everything. All right. I'll see you every day. Hi. Mark will take care of you. Hi. Hi can I get your last name, please? Yes, it's Gerringson. I was going to get married, but I got sick instead. Now, he's having a baby with his new wife. And I know about it. And that's the word, words, words, words. So Gerringson then? Yes. New meds. New everything. Pharmacist. Patient is Gloria Gerringson. Gerringson? Yeah, I have her right here. X55 35GLH. So you're canceling the previous-- Yes, and replace it with-- Look, at these. You're a pill. Hey, hey, hey, you're a pill too. Has the patient been counseled about this? Yes, she's been informed. What is this? This is great. Miss Gerringson, your new medications were just called in. Have you taken them before, because it's best to take them with food. Yeah, yeah, I know all about it. Everything's changing. It's changing. But it's all for my own good. So I know. I know. OK, well, it's going to be a few minutes. You're welcome to wait over there if you like. OK. You guys have those chairs that spin around really fast? Mark. Sh-- sorry about that? Are they ready? They're ready. Hey, you're criminal acquaintance is loitering outside the door of this family friendly establishment. If you want to take care of that. All right, we'll finish this later I guess. Hey. Sorry, I blew you off at school today. Oh, it's OK, really. Do you want to like go somewhere? Drive some place? Did you tell some people that we're going to prom together? It was more like a wish. I just told the two Amys when I was getting the tickets. Was that totally lame? It feels like everyone at school is talking. It's like before, that whole thing. I don't like it. I think we should just be cool for a while. So cool. I won't fall asleep for fear of a creeping nightmare a recurring dream where I'm no longer a child. I want a life to call my own, no more learning through palindromes I'd take the stars, if they only shone. I'll meet my makeshift family beneath the shade of that willow tree. And kick my sorrows as they leave. In dreaming I see the dust pile up on unused toys, while my skeleton grows and my thoughts run cohesive and poised. But wandering calls, and my eyes will steadily darken. The chattering walls will keep me company. Mom, what are you doing on the floor? Look, stars. I'm so tired. Not me. Did you go to the pharmacy today? Oh, that silly place Just please tell me you went. Please. Come here with me. OK. Of all the lies to call my own. I don't see any stars, Mom. It's just the ceiling. No, they're stars. Just see them in your mind. I don't see any stars, Mom. There are stars. It keeps my child away from me. Wake me up so that I can leave. That's girl. How many kids go to the school here? Um-- 3,000. 3,000 that is a lot. Gloria, you have to pace yourself sweetie. 3,0003,000, huh? Beth. Beth. Everyone know. I just wanted to take you to prom. I just thought that if I bought the tickets it would just come true. And I just want to be normal for one night. Let's-- uh-- let's go to prom. Yes, fruit cocktail. Here you go. Why? You know I'm actually really pretty under here. It's just my uniform. You know it's not me, right? The gals know, right, gals? It isn't-- this isn't me. You guys know. You guys all know. Yeah, go ahead take one. Gloria. Hey. Hey what seems to be the trouble here? Fruit cocktail is so colorful far right. So what I tried to do is I-- I-- took it. And I wanted to put it right in the center. So it just-- it just stood out like a star, you know. And be seen. So it's not taken for granted any more, you know. Like do you-- do you know what I mean? Yes. Truly? Yes. Yes. Gloria, are you OK? I'm trying to be OK? Why don't you go home. And do whatever you need to do come back tomorrow. And we'll put you on meats. Meats? Meats, yeah. Hi. How are you? I think I have mail for you. Ooh, the mail's so pretty today. I never really thought about it like that, but I guess it is. Sometimes you have to look at things. Do you know what I mean? Do ya? Ma'am, I got a lot of mail I've got to deliver. Maybe you should go inside and rest? I'll wait out. Come in with me. Come on. I'm a great lay. We can do it standing up to our favorite song. What is out favorite song? No, no, ma'am. Come on. Mom? What are you doing? Organizing mail. No. It's not cooked yet. Hello, Dad. Hey, Beth. I-- I found but she's acting weird right now. You can't trust anybody right now. Give me back my phone, Mom, please. No, you can't anybody. They're all out there. You don't let them get me. Because the last time I trusted somebody, they took you away from me. Don't trust people. I know they're out there. But the pretend not to be. They're all out there trying to pull me away. But-- but-- but-- nope. These are not your meds, Mom. You didn't get your meds. Beth. There's no locked doors around here, Beth. What are you doing in there. Dad? Hello. Mom's off her meds. Beth, stop! Hello? Stop! Let's go. Don't do that. Where we going to go? Dad, we have to look for her? We have to find her. Somebody could hurt her out there. You have it all mixed up. She's dangerous like this. You don't get to tell me about her. I live with her. I take care of her. My life is her. That is not what I wanted. I wanted you to stay with me. So you can make sure that I wouldn't turn out like her. No, no, that is not true. It is true. Dad, people don't have all these choices that you think everyone has. You have a choice. If I stay, I stay for her. If I go, it's so that you feel better about leaving her. If you do see her, just-- That I'll work for your future where I want to live in again. I think we should try again by Dr. Rutter's. He things that she's going to go there again eventually. What would you be doing today if you weren't looking for her? What? What would your day be like if it wasn't all about her. What would you be doing? I don't know. Think about it. I guess I sort of have a date tonight. Like a date date? It's prom. Prom? Well, let's-- let's go. Dad, I-- I can't go. Well, I think you should go. With mom still out there. Beth, you haven't seen it at it's worse. I loved her. I did. But I needed to leave her. OK, one, two. We're going to get it. Right there. Chin up. OK. Since my mom is sort of AWOL right now, would it be all right if we left the prom a little early? Sure, I can leave as soon as we get there. Can I just try something? Just one little thing. You can take it down if you don't like it. But I think you're going to like it a lot. And, yes, you look beautiful. Thank you for everything. Any time. Close your eyes. What are you doing? Uh, uh, keep them closed. Imagine that the sun is under the floor. Singing songs until the morning. Mom? Mom? Little guys, little guys. Hello, soldiers. Mom. Where did you sleep last night? There's no time for sleep. Me and Paul. Mom, you're not on your medication right now. They switched it up. This isn't you right now. The storm's here. The storm is here. Knives. Just-- just stop, please. Please stop acting crazy. Just act like yourself please. Everything must remain the same. There she goes again. Hiding. And hiding is lying. And that's the easy way out. Everything remains in it's place. So I get to die. What? The plan. It's my plan. Have you always the question. Have you-- stop. I can't do this any more. I can't do this any more. Just look at me. I can't take care of you. I can't do. I can't do it. I just can't. Please look at me. I'm sorry. I'm not going to lie to you any more. I'm not going to lie to you any more. And I know that you're sick and I hate it. And I know some day, I might end up sick too. But right now, I have to take of myself. I'm going to go to California. OK? OK? No, no, no, no, stop. You-- Help! Help, we're in the kitchen. Please. Do you have any idea what you did to her? You did this. Yeah, OK, I did this. Right? My fault. I did nothing. You made me. What are you talking about? Made you run away. Made you say you had to live in here because nobody understood you? Huh? Made you look like this? What was I supposed to do? You didn't do anything. Hey. Hey. I don't have to wear these for long. It's just regulation. How are you? Beth, talk to me. Want to come in? Let me look at you. What are you doing? Taking these stupid things off of you. Stop it. You're going to get in trouble. Thank you. I'm really sorry, Beth. I'm really sorry that I made you sit in the car all those times. That wasn't right. I just tried to keep you all to myself. I know you did, Mom. Mom. What? Look at me. You are my favorite person. You're my favorite person, too. I love you. And I love you. Raise up my voice. Into the night. It is surely not yours. Yet somehow not mine. We are alive with our Lazarus lives. For our souls to find with no hope in sight Maybe, baby, you come back to life. Would you walk with me? Walk with me through the shadow of death. Would you love me? You're all I have left. Find my heart buried deep in my chest. And come back to life. Come back, come back. Maybe baby, you come back to life. Maybe baby, you come back to life. Maybe, baby, maybe baby, maybe baby, you come back to life.
