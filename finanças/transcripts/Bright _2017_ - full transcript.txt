[MAN] Ward. Red sauce? Green sauce? [PLANE PASSING LOW OVERHEAD] [RACKING ROUND] [GUNSHOT ECHOES] [WOMAN] Babe, you up? It's after noon, you gotta get up. I made some coffee, come on. [WARD GROANS] - [RAP MUSIC PLAYING NEARBY] - [WOMAN 2 WHOOPS OUTSIDE] [WOMAN] There he is. - Morning. - Afternoon. [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Hi. - Hi. Hi. - [WHISPERS] Coffee. - I know. What the hell's this in my... - What's that shit in there? - What? [WARD GRUNTS] - Whoops. - Yeah. Ran out of coffee filters, had to use a napkin. - It'll be fine. - I'll just chew that up next time. - [HIGH-PITCHED CHATTERING] - Oh, come on. Why is the Fairy in the bird feeder again? - I... I thought... - You told me that you killed it. All right, I'm gonna be honest with you. All right? - Please. - I don't fuck with no Fairies. You need to fuck with that one. When I was little, my cousin DayDay was throwing rocks at this Fairy. - The Fairy shit in his own hand... - Uh-huh. ...threw the shit, and it went in DayDay's eye, and it was like a fucking cantaloupe. - Bullshit story. - No, he almost lost his eye. - I'm telling you. Listen... - That's not true. $200. Pay the man. Same man that does the bees. No, I'm not paying $200. I got this big, handsome, strapping man standing right in front of me. Go kill that Fairy, please. Thank you so much. I'll kill the Fairy. Let me finish my coffee. - I'mma kill the Fairy. All right? - Okay. That may kill you. You should do it before you finish the coffee. [CHUCKLES] - How was work? - Eh, work. Work is good, you know? Just, a lot of stab wounds lately. There's, uh... We had this homeless guy come in, throwing equipment everywhere. It was wild. A lot of traffic accidents, - and this older guy, he coded out on me. - [MAN] What about that cop that's an Orc that's now on the LAPD force? - How does that work? - [MAN 2] He's not blooded. He's not part of any blooded clan. He's like a finger that got cut off the hand. He's dead to us. [SIGHS HEAVILY] This is shock trauma at its finest. [MAN]...and then you see the humans and the Elves... I don't want this guy in my car either. Baby, I don't want you to get shot again. Five years, I'm gonna retire. But... I can't fuck up my pension. All right? I mean, that's my fucking worst nightmare. You know what my worst nightmare is? It's them wheeling you in when I'm at work. That's my nightmare. Come on. Come here. - [SQUEAL, THUD] - Fairy. Now. - [RAP MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY] - [FAIRY SHRIEKING, MUTTERING] [MAN] Hey, y'all, I want y'all to trip off my police-ass neighbor. He's a trip. - Good afternoon, Officer. - Hey. What up, Mike? Yo, that Fairy been all up in my crib, eating up my dog food and shit. I'm about to call the city, man. I am the city. All right? You save your dime. Fairy lives don't matter today. Check this out, y'all. This is probably gonna be good. - [FAIRY CHATTERING] - [MAN] It's on now! - [FAIRY SHRIEKS] - [MIKE] Ring the bell, y'all. - [ALL] Oh! - [OVERLAPPING CHATTER] Damn. Look at this nigga, man. - [GRUNTS] - Oh, that's it right there. Oh, you got it now. Take the homie out LAPD-style like you do. [ALL] Oh! [MAN 1] You ain't gotta do him like that. Damn! [MIKE] That was nasty. - [MAN 2] Man. - [MAN 1] Come on, G. - It's what I do. - [MIKE] Oh, shit. Oh, and, uh, you keep doing all your gangsta stuff. I'm just trying to sell my house. Don't worry about that. [MAN 3] Thanks for the show, Officer. He's a trip. That motherfucker's crazy. Got a fine-ass wife, too. [LAUGHTER] Are you in trouble? Am I in trouble? What your mother say to you? Mom said that Nick got you in trouble because Orcs are dumb. That's not true, all right? Orcs are not dumb. Just, uh... All of the races are-are different. Okay? And just 'cause they're different doesn't mean anybody's smarter or dumber, you know, better or worse than anybody. All right? It's just-just... You know, everybody's just trying to get along and-and... have a good life. [CLATTERING OUTSIDE] What the hell? Hey, baby, you gotta take some clothes. Get some clothes. - Fine. - [HORN HONKS] - [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] - Hey, hey! Hey, partner. Ready to get back to work? All healed up? What the hell are you doing at my house? Why are you at my house? Why are you on my lawn? Your lawn's dead, Ward. Exactly. Which is why I seeded it and spread cow shit everywhere so it grows back. That's not really cow shit. - What do you mean it's not cow shit? - It's sewage, from toilets. From the treatment plant, swear to God. I paid $400 for this. - That's bullshit. - Human shit. - Why do you think I compost? - Whatever. Whatever. Whatever. You don't ever come here in that ever again. I was at diversity training. Your house is on the way to the bar. I thought... - Hi, Nick. - Hey, Sophia. What's up, rock star? We're gonna go to Grandma's. - Grandma's? Hop in, we'll give you a ride. - Shut up. - This ain't no Uber, man. - Don't tell Nick to shut up. He's a person, too. Oh, thank you, sweetie. That's an enlightened kid you got there, Daryl. [GRUNTS] Don't worry about me. Just Crip-walk your asses on back to the barbecue. Be nice to give you a ride... - Shut up. - ...on your first day back. [SIGHS] ♪ Leave him on the floor With his brains spilt out ♪ ♪ Tanners, scanners, bananas Pimped out... ♪ Lovely song. ♪ Come through the hood And you will get fucked up ♪ There's Grandma. Hey. Uh, I'm... Okay. Good to see you. Uh... All right, baby. What's up? What's happening? What's up? Why you sad? What happened? I don't want you to die. I'm not gonna die. What are you... - What you talking about? - Mama said Nick's gonna get you killed. [STAMMERS] I don't know why she said... Nick is not gonna get me killed, all right? Why do you have to be a policeman? Everybody hates policemen. - [DOOR SLAMS] - [SIGHS] Hey... [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] Know what? You smell like you haven't slept. I have melatonin in my war bag. You take one before bed, - turn off the laptop, get... - Maybe I'm having trouble sleeping because of the nightmares I'm having from being blasted across the street with a shotgun while your ass was getting a burrito. But I was getting a burrito for you. - Yeah... - I don't eat cow flesh. Do you think that you could get a burrito and do your job? You think you could get a burrito and watch my back - like every other cop manages to do? - Yes. Look, I know... you're disappointed in me. I know that you think that I let you down. - Yeah. You know what? - But I... - [SIGHS] - You know what? It's a new day. Back to work. We hitting the reset button. Copy that. Copy that. We're hitting the reset button. Moving forward together. As friends, together. - [HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS] - [TURNS MUSIC OFF] We will not be listening to no Orkish music. That is one of the greatest love songs ever written. That's a love song in prison. I believe that you're lacking in love, Ward. - I'm what? - By love, I mean... like... physical love. Yeah. Um... Right? I'm straight. I don't need no physical love. Trust me, I'm good. You can't hide it, Ward. Humans have physical tells. - Tells, huh? - Yeah. - It's called a face. - I ain't making no face. - Like the face you're making right now. - I ain't making no face. All right. What face am I making? "A human who needs a lot more conjugal love" type face. "Conjugal love" face. So you know human face... Show me another human face. - What's another one we make? - Oh, uh... - What's that face? - Human who doesn't get anymore pancakes. [WARD CHUCKLES] - We do like our pancakes, for real. - I got a lot of 'em. - You got a lot? - I got a lot of them. Show me the face an Orc makes when he just shut the fuck up, and don't say shit, and just drive to work. Yeah, that's it! That's it! Oh, you got that one! - [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] - [WARD] Yeah, you killing that one. You should do that one. Do that one, like, all the time. [WARD] Whoa. Whoa. Why you going this way? [JAKOBY] It's fine, it's a shortcut. See? They're very nice here. [WARD] Dude, you can't go through Elftown. You are killing me. Killing me, dude. So, what, you trying to... get yourself some designer shoes? Ain't nothing over here but rich-ass Elves just running the world and shopping. ["CROWN" PLAYING] [CHATTERING] [WARD] I hate Elftown. Even the chauffeurs are snobs. ♪ I'm running for the crown ♪ ♪ Running for the crown ♪ ♪ So heavy on my, heavy on my bones ♪ ♪ When I'm sittin' on my Sittin' on my throne ♪ ♪ I'm running for the ♪ Hey. Back already, Ward? Where's the, uh, diversity hire you ride with? Yeah, what kind of partner is Jakoby? Is he your dance partner? Your sexual partner? 'Cause he fucking sucks at catching bad guys. That's Clan Law shit, dog. Orcs got each other's backs. Hey, look, why y'all acting like I put this dude in my car? So what are you doing to get him the fuck out of this division? Hey, long as he pull his weight, I ain't got no beef with him. No. No, no, no. You could do shit, man. You could write a letter. His ass would be gone if we back you up. That's a fact. - But you only care about yourself, Ward. - Right. Did I... Did I ask you for advice? 'Cause I'll probably wait till I'm on my, like, ninth divorce, then your advice will come in really handy. That's good. That's fucking good. Noted. Meanwhile, that Orc fuck is still out there because Jakoby chose clan blood over the badge. Or the motherfucker just got away. He got away 'cause Jakoby let him. What happens next? What happens the next time this pig motherfucker makes a cop suck-start his fucking 12-gauge? Only this time, it's Brown, or it's Hicks, or it's fucking me. How you gonna feel, Ward? 'Cause that shit is on you. Well, if you in the box, I'll probably be like... - [CHUCKLES] - Ward, you son of a bitch. Hey, look, I got a dude in my car, the whole world is watching, all right? I didn't ask for it, I don't want it, but I don't get a vote. And what happens if they hire more? You know what they say. Once with the Dark Lord, always with the Dark Lord. They chose evil. Here's the thing I can't understand. How do a bunch of dudes who can barely remember their baby mama's birthday have beef with a whole race over some shit that happened 2,000 years ago? Here's the fucking deal, man. You keep Jakoby the fuck away from me. Okay? I'll drop an Orc. I don't give a fuck. My ancestors killed them by the fucking thousands in Russia. [LOW CHATTER] [APPLAUSE] - [MAN 1] Attaboy, Ward! - [MAN 2] About time, Ward. [WOMAN] All right, settle down, settle down. The captain's coming. [JAKOBY] Ward, I saved you a seat. [WOMAN] Take it away, boss. Ward, nice to see you back. Cap. - [CAPTAIN] Tonight's the trifecta. - Hey, is that your cousin? [CAPTAIN] Full moon, Friday night... - No. - ...summer heat wave. THAT MEANS: clear your calls fast, help your colleagues clear theirs, get me out of this deployment period without another murder, I'll buy you all coffee. Sergeant Ching, all yours.

I just need to... - Okay. Three-A-99... - No. - Yes. Put him in another car. What the fuck about my demeanor gives you the impression that I want to be a target on the department's Orc-diversity radar? These decisions are made nine miles above me. No. They're made right on your paper, right there. Scratch him out. Scratch his name out. Put another name, anybody. Ward, no one wants to ride with you. Goodbye. Don't get shot again. [OFFICERS JEERING, LAUGHING] Good luck. - [MAN] Hey, looking good, bud. - [WOMAN] Looking real good. Real good. Be safe, guys. [CHATTERING] [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [SIREN CHIRPS] What's up, homies? Your ass still alive? You know something about that? It wasn't me. Get the fuck off of the street or I'mma call your PO, tell him you out drinking with the homies. I ain't gonna tell you two times. Let's go.

Roger, show us en route. Three-A-9, roger. The fuck outta here. - [SIREN WAILING] - [MAN GRUNTS] God damn it! - [TIRES SCREECH, SIREN STOPS] - [MAN GRUNTING] - [MAN CONTINUES GRUNTING] - Rodriguez. Hey. - Oh, shit, man. I thought you were dead. - [LAUGHS] Nah, man, too many bills to pay. [RODRIGUEZ] I hear ya. [WARD] I thought you were out having your, like, zillionth baby. Ah, nah, man. Marisol's a week late. We're inducing next week, though. - Number five. - [EXHALES] - Five. - Lot of mouths to feed. Yeah, man. [VOICE ECHOES] Sir... drop the sword. You. The Army of Nine Races fought shoulder to shoulder to give you the world you neglect. - Hey, tell him to shut up. - [MAN] 2,000 years ago, - we fought them with swords and arrows. - Sir... And now, the Dark One returns to reclaim Orc hearts! Everywhere I go, why have Orcs always gotta be the bad guys? Hey, don't look at me, man. Mexicans still get shit for the Alamo. - [WOMAN SCREAMS] - Get back! Get back! Sir, unless you wanna die, you drop that sword right fucking now! Hey, you got me shot, don't get me stabbed.

Gang intel said Fogteeth's been smashing like a motherfucker, and Altamira's gangbanging like it's 1999. - Watch your backs out there. - Hey, you too. - All right, brother. - Kiss your family. - [INDISTINCT POLICE RADIO CHATTER] - [MAN COUGHS BEHIND WARD] [CLEARS THROAT, GRUNTS] Sir, can you sit back? You-You stink like shit. Can you sit back? Thank you. Come on. That's bad. [IN ORKISH] I have a message from the Shield of Light. Remember the old ways. Remember what you are. Is that Orkish? How the hell do you know how to speak Orkish? What'd he say? [IN ORKISH] Remember your traditions. Only clan ways can save you. The Prophecy has chosen you. The man with you is blessed. - [HORN HONKING] - Jakoby! [TIRES SQUEALING] Come on, man. What the hell is your problem? What'd he say? He's not making any sense. [CAPTAIN] Where's Jakoby? Uh, booking our body, ma'am. Um, I love your hair. - Who are you? - [CHUCKLES] I'm the unemployment line, or a prison sentence. I could be the Angel of Mercy, but it's up to you, buddy. Ah. Internal Affairs. That's right, all fucking day long. Now, let's review, kids. Some pigskin piece of shit puts a load of buckshot into your trauma plate. - Shithead foot-bails, Jakoby pursues... - Hey! - [PEOPLE SHOUTING] - Hey! [IN ORKISH] Police! Stop! ...corners his asshole in, what, a dead-end alley? [MAN 1] Jakoby states dude tackled and disarmed him. Then jumped on a fire escape ladder and evaded arrest. Jakoby's signed statement. [MAN 2] Ladder's 13 feet off the ground. We measured. - [MAN 1] Mm-hmm. - [MAN 2] No Orc has a six-foot vertical. Perhaps the suspect was light on his feet, sir. Do Orcs have, uh, mad hops? How many Orcs are ballers? - Excuse me? - You fuckin' heard the detective. - How many Orcs play pro basketball? - None. They're slow, they're heavy. That's why half the NFL defensive lines are Orkish. It's not racism, it's physics. Jakoby kicked loose that pigskin fuck who blasted you. Do the math. Orcs hold Clan Law above all else. That's a fact. The Jakoby issue is sensitive. The world's watching. - We can't fire him without cause. - [MAN 2] Which is why... you're gonna get him to admit it... and you're gonna record him. The fuck outta here. I want the guy out of my car, but... I snitch, I'm done as a street cop. We know, uh, you got a house note you can't pay down. Right? Drowning in debt. Raising a little girl you can't afford to pay for. Mmm. Father of the fucking year. You talk about my family again, I'll split your fucking head open. Ward. You need this job. Don't throw it away for Jakoby. Get off me. Get off me. Give it to me. No testifying... no depositions, no paperwork. Good man. Very smart. Shave your mustache, bitch. [MAN SNICKERS] It's just business. [ENGINE REVS] - [MAN GROANING] - [PUNCHES LANDING] Place is a shithole. An Orc with a badge. Incredible. That's some shit you don't see every day. Like an Elf with a mop. Did you see those two guys? I think they're feds. Could they be here for me? Feds don't give a shit about the LA Orc community. Yeah, you're right. [ENGINE STARTS] [TYPING ON KEYBOARD] S... So, my-my daughter... um... Sophia... she be doing shit all the time, man, that she don't have no business doing. Um... But... she comes clean. She always tells the truth. 'Cause she realized it feels good. Feels good to her, feels good to me. And, uh, truth just has a way... of clearing the air between people. If it cleanses... cleanses some shit, you know, it's like, just tell the truth. I know something very bad happened at the station. I know. So are you gonna tell me about it or no? I'm talking about you. All right? Don't be trying to twist this. Nothing happened at the... - I'm not... - [DISPATCHER]...trouble, 341 Abrams. Code two, incident 2815. Three-Adam-9, show us en route. - [SIREN WAILING] - [WARD] 341 Abrams. [DISPATCHER] Three-A-9, roger. How long you been in Shield of Light? What's that? [GRUNTS] God! You little fuck-up. - [BUZZER WHIRS, STOPS] - Aah! Shit! What are you doing, man? - [GRUNTS] - [MAN] No questions, just shut up. Hey, nice Shield of Light tattoo! - Good one. - You know who we are? - Housekeeping. - [CHORTLES] You might wanna look at this. Fuck. Magic Task Force. Right. The magic feds. You know, Serling, if you're gonna play stupid games, you're gonna win stupid prizes. Fuck you. You wanna test me, asshole? Okay! I'm not your enemy, man. What do you know about the Inferni? Um... they're Elves. Renegade Elves. Renegade Elves, sorry. Because Elves are awesome, right? They're gonna bring back the Dark Lord. Fairy fucking tales. How do they plan to do that? When they get three Magic Wands, they can raise him from the dead. [ELF] You recognize her? That's Leilah. She's an Inferni coven leader. She's a Bright. You ever notice how most Brights are Elves, and Elves run the world? Coincidence? There are human Brights. One in a million. But you know how you know if you're a Bright? When you touch a Wand... with your bare hand... and don't explode. Would you do that? Would you die to learn the truth about yourself? If I had a Wand... I'd try. [MAN] Let's get back on track. So Leilah has a Magic Wand, and she's coming after Tikka, right? And she'll shred this city to do it. We get Tikka, we can set a trap for Leilah. We hunt Wands, we hunt Brights. That's what we do, and we're pretty fucking good at it. You wanna help us? Come on. The Dark Lord's coming. What, are you gonna to fight him with, with tanks? Huh? You gonna drone him? Two thousand years ago, magic stopped him. And magic will stop him again. One day, you all are gonna come begging for our help. And we'll be there. We'll stop him. The Shield of Light will stop him. I'm done. We're done. If you act like my enemy... you become my enemy. See that? - [JAKOBY] Oh, it's a spotter. - [WARD] Mm-hmm. [GUNSHOTS] [WARD] Get down! Down! Go! - Oh. Yeah, that's... That's not good. - [DOGS BARKING NEARBY] - Yeah. - We could die. [GUNSHOTS CONTINUE] - First time being shot at? - Yeah. I have to say, I dislike it very much. - Yeah, it fucking sucks. - [BULLET RICOCHETS] All right, look... on three, we're gonna dump this asshole. - [GUNSHOTS] - All right? Right. That makes sense. [STAMMERS] Use force. - All right. - Yeah. One, two, three. [JAKOBY GROANS, GRUNTS] - You all right? - Hmm? Yeah. - No holes? - Huh? Uh... Only the ones that I was born with. How are your holes? The fuck can you make a shootout awkward? Sorry. Sorry. [BOTH GRUNTING] [WARD] Wait for the reload! All right? - He's gonna have to reload. - Reload. Now! - [BOTH PANTING] - [JAKOBY] Shit. [GUN CLATTERS, THUDS] We got him. Get the door. Get the door. - Shouldn't we wait for the cavalry? - We are the cavalry. Ward, can't we wait for backup? Ward. [WARD] Go, go, go. - [WARD PANTING] - [JAKOBY] I smell blood, Ward. Lots of blood. - [JAKOBY] What's that? - [WARD WHISPERS] Don't know. [JAKOBY] Oh, shit. - Body. Body. - [JAKOBY] What? Shit. Shit. [WARD] Cover the hall. - What the fuck is that? - Cover the hall. Okay. [WHISPERS] Oh, shit. Don't touch anything. [STAMMERS] Yeah. - [WARD] Body. - [JAKOBY] Wh...? [WARD] That's our shooter, he's down. [SOFT CLATTER] [JAKOBY] Someone's in here. I can smell them. These people died so bad. [WARD] Clear. [EXHALES] Something unusual has happened here. Three-Adam-9, 341 Abrams. Possible Bright at our location. Request additional units and a supervisor. I REPEAT: Possible magic-user on scene. [SOFT CLATTER] [WARD] Hey! Freeze! You! Wait, stop! Hey! Hey! Stop running! [WARD GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] - Hold her, hold her! - Stop! Stop! Stop! What has she got? - [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] - What is that? What is that? Go get the homies. Put it down or I'm gonna shoot you in your face! [WHIMPERING] [BREATH TREMBLING] Is that...? It's a Magic Wand. [WARD] Who, uh... Who are you? [IN ELVISH] Please protect me. [JAKOBY] She's speaking Elvish. I don't speak Elvish. Well, I took two years in high school, but, uh... [SPEAKS ELVISH] She said somebody's coming. Please protect me and the Wand. As far as I can tell, a Bright came in, used the Wand, and... magicked everybody the fuck up. Uh... We need to evacuate this neighborhood, secure the scene, hold the perimeter till the feds get here. What the fuck are you, new? - This is way above our pay grade. - [MAN] That's magic right there. That's whatever you want. You want a million dollars? You want ten million? You wanna be taller or shorter? Make your dick bigger? You wanna go back in time, marry the girl who didn't blow you on prom night? That's how you do it, right there. Well, clearly, we had different prom nights. But that is a Magic Wand, and you don't know how to use it. And you're gonna kill us all trying. Only a Bright can use a Wand, and you don't look like a wizard to me. - Don't put your hands on that Wand. - [SHUSHING] - [WARD] Hey, don't touch the Wand. - I got it. [WARD] Don't touch it. Hey, hey, hey. [STAMMERS] Don't be... Fucking ice cold. - All right, you're not stealing that Wand. - Nobody's coming, Ward. Whoa. Hey... Fuck is you squaring off on, bitch? Hey, Sarge, you need to talk to your boys right now. You need this just as much as we do, maybe more. Your family depends on you. Don't you wanna be there for them? What about Jakoby? [IN ELVISH] Can you tell me your name? - [WHISPERS] Tikka. - Tikka. My name is Tikka. We have to leave before she comes. Before who comes? It's not happening. No. No. Pollard, he's spinning. - No, he's not spinning worth shit. - [POLLARD] He's fine, he's fine. - This is stupid. - Calm down. - Hey, fucking chill. He's fine. - Back up. - He's fin... Hey, hey! - The fuck you gonna do? Calm down. Fucking calm down. Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up. Listen. Listen. This is happening. - This is fucking happening. - Fuck off of me. [SIGHS] All right? - Fuck. - It's okay. It's okay. There's no version of you walking out of here with life as you know it intact. Fuck this. We are taking the Wand, and the Orc dies. And you got a big decision right now. Either your little girl grows up without a daddy and Jakoby dies, or just Jakoby dies. And it is time to make a choice. [CHING] You or him, Ward. You or him. Is tomorrow's LA Times gonna say one cop died here, or two? Yeah, there it is. He just caught up to it. [POLLARD] Everyone wins. Department gets rid of Jakoby, he dies a hero, public's happy. This report writes itself. The perfect storm, bro. It's the perfect storm. - [CLUB MUSIC PLAYING] - [PHONE VIBRATES] You okay? Hey. Take Sophia, get out of town right now. What? Why? Get out of town right now. I love you. [JAKOBY] Ward, where is everyone? We haven't even set a perimeter. I'm pretty certain that pee-wee gangster saw the Wand. And she is spooked. Says somebody's coming. Like... Like, someone bad. But what's...? You seem like you-you have bigger troubles. You let the shooter go, didn't you? 'Cause he was clan blood? Now? You wanna fucking go through this right now? What else you lie about, pigface? Don't put your fucking hands on me! You fucked me. You fucked us both. Pigskin piece of shit. You fucked my whole life over some stupid Orc knucklehead. Fuck you, Ward. Fuck off. - What...? - I dare you. I dare you to pull your gun. Please. Go ahead. I will fuck you up in a gunfight. I gave you plenty of time to talk about this shit. - Karma is a bitch, and here it come. - I let him go. So what's the real plan? Two cops die tonight. What about the Elf? [POLLARD] I'll kill her. - You good? - [MAN] Yes, sir. - Yeah. - Sarge? You see my teeth? They're filed. I'm not blooded, my father's not blooded, his father's not blooded. I've been shit on by Orcs my whole fucking life. Huh? You know what that feels like, when your own people hate you? Why'd you lie, Nick? It wasn't clan politics. I just had the wrong guy. Oh. Story time? [JAKOBY] The guy that shot you, I lost him in the crowd. I circled back, and I thought I had that fucking guy dead to rights. But it was a different kid. He was just tagging. And the troops are coming. Jacked-up humans with guns looking for an Orc who'd shot a cop. You think that kid had a chance? Go, go, go! They would've dropped him on the spot, so I did the right thing. - Code four. - Clear. You never saw his face. How'd you know it wasn't the motherfucker that shot me? His fucking smell. Yeah, years of evolution haven't taken away our sense of smell. And he smelled different. - What human jury would believe me? - What, he have Axe body spray? Yeah, see, this is what I have to fucking deal with. The Orc that shot you... - got away. - Ward! It's time. [GASPS] "It's... time"? Time for... Time for what? All four of 'em standing there? - Yeah. - Your left to right, who is it? Brown, Hicks, Pollard, and Ching. What's going on, Ward?

[IN ELVISH] Protect the Wand. Those cops there... they okay? That's a lot of blood, homes. That ain't none of your concern. Maybe you should go over and give 'em a little mouth-to-mouth. Huh? [WARD] This is an active crime scene. We ain't never had no beef, Poison. Why don't you take your people home. Word on the street, there's a Wand in this hood. [MAN] Where's it at, man? - My hood. - Altamira. Alta-fucking-mira, eh? [MAN] That's right. So, when the little homies tell that the cops are shooting each other in my hood... makes me wonder. Hmm? Where's the Wand? Ghetto rumors, homie. Don't wanna get shot in your face over a rumor, do you? Why don't you go head home? The Wand belongs to the people. - To the barrio. - [JAKOBY] Get back! Homeboy. - You heard me. - Smooth. [POISON] It's mine... if I have to kill every fucking cop in LA. You're gonna get your chance, 'cause SWAT is about 90 seconds out. Nick, get in the truck. Get in the fucking truck, Nick! - Listen to your master. Get in the truck. - Fuck you. - Fuck you, homie. - Fuck you.

[OVERLAPPING SHOUTS IN SPANISH] - [MAN SPEAKS IN SPANISH] - [GIRL MURMURS IN SPANISH] [MAN SPEAKS SPANISH] [IN SPANISH] Please, sir. [INHALES] [IN SPANISH] Tell me what happened. - Tell me. - [MAN GASPS] [IN SPANISH] Cops started shooting at each other, and a black cop killed them all.

You need to sit your crazy ass down. Look, half of our division is on some old-school Rampart shit, a'ight? They're gonna kill you first, then they're gonna kill me, they're gonna take the Wand, and that's when the stupid shit's gonna start. And by the way, that's only if the gangstas don't get it first. And that's when the triple stupid shit's gonna start. We gotta get out of this neighborhood. Yeah, but the Wand is gonna stop us. The binding spell is gonna stop us. We'll hide the Wand. We'll hide it here and come back and get it. I am not abandoning the Wand. - We are not the fucking Wand police. - You want bodies on the street? Huh? All of LA on fire? This is like a nuclear weapon that grants wishes. - [LOW CHATTER OUTSIDE] - [JAKOBY] No. The feds have people that deal with magic. - [STAMMERS] We call them. We ask... - You wanna call the feds? I got bodies on my gun, remember? Yeah, well, don't look at me, I just let an Orc go. Really, Nick? Really? That was irony. - No, that's just being an asshole. - Oh. Gonna call Rodriguez. He's a sheriff, he's not LAPD. - He's solid as fuck. We can trust him. - That's a good idea. - [LOW CHATTER CONTINUES] - Shh, shh. - [IN ELVISH] They're coming for the Wand. - [WHISPERS] Ah, shit. - [MAN OUTSIDE WHISTLES] - [DOG BARKS, GROWLING] - [JAKOBY] What is it? - The lock.

[HIGH-PITCHED TONE] [TONE FADES] [JAKOBY] Where did they all go? I think we're breathing 'em. [COUGHS] - Hey, do me a favor. - Uh-huh? Don't drop that shit no more. What? No. Why would I? [JAKOBY COUGHS] [DOGS BARKING NEARBY] - [GUNSHOTS] - [TIKKA SCREAMS] - [MAN SHOUTS IN SPANISH] - [WARD] Ah, shit! Ah! [WHISPERS] Ward... [STAMMERS] I shot a human. Did you see? Yeah, I'll get you some ice cream later. Damn. - I'm hit. - [JAKOBY] What? They're not gonna stop. They're gonna keep coming. Let's go. [DISHES CLATTERING] What are you doing here?

You want to, uh, unpack this for me, boss? [SOFTLY] Leilah. Leilah was here. What are you talking about? She was sent to kill Tikka, - then Tikka did that. - She wants her Wand back, right? - Yes. - And Tikka has it. - Yes. - And those cops she ran off with, uh... - Ward and... - [SCOFFING CHUCKLE] What? Jakoby. The Orc cop we saw at the station. They have no idea who Tikka is. It's been 20 years. What does that even mean? Twenty years I've been hunting Leilah. Without her Wand... she's vulnerable. - [HORNS HONKING] - [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [JAKOBY] Now's a bad time to go shopping, Ward. Everybody's looking for two cops. We gotta switch it up. [JAKOBY] Oh, yeah. Running through a Fogteeth party is not good community policing. Yeah, well, we're alive, and we got the Wand. Orcs hold grudges. That's all I'm saying. [WARD] Tell me about it. Hey, follow me. Let's go. - [JAKOBY] Tikka. - [GASPS] - Oh, thank you, ma'am. - Go. [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] [MAN LAUGHING] - That's good. - Thank you. Take your old lady, get the fuck outta here. Go. Go. [GASPS] I need you to get the fuck outta here. All right? Go. [WOMAN] Jesus. [RAP MUSIC CONTINUES] - [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] - [PEOPLE SCREAMING] [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [MAN] Whoo! [SCREAMS CONTINUE] Seven dudes with choppers down the right, five down the left. Bunch of motherfuckers in the middle. Officer Ward... I think we need to talk. Hey, Poison, how you doing? [POISON] Some fucked-up shit went down tonight. My homies wanna cut your fucking head off, the cops wanna cut your fucking head off, the Fogteeth gang wanna cut your fucking head off. Yeah, I got that effect on people, Poison. Imagine how my old lady feels. [POISON] Me? I just wanna protect you. Mmm. Get you home safe and sound, with all your sins forgiven. But you gotta give me that Wand. You wanna do the right thing? Help me walk again. Help me make love to my old lady again. Help me get rid of this shit again. Give me the fucking Wand, or I will nail every door in this place shut and burn this place down to the fucking ground. And then I will pick up the Wand from the ashes, and I will laugh. Chopping it up with the homie for a sec, Poison. I'm running out of patience, Officer Ward. [WARD SIGHS] - Let's give this motherfucker the Wand. - What? Look, we gonna get everybody in here killed, and then he's gonna take the damn Wand anyway. I'm not giving that guy the Wand. Over my dead body. He's gonna have to kill me first. So you wanna die in a gunfight in a nasty-ass titty bar? That's what you want? - [GASPS] - [JAKOBY] I don't wanna die anywhere. You know what? Now I do. Fuck it. I wanna die. Let's do it right now. We gonna titty-bar-gunfight die. Let's do it right here, right now. Ready? I just wish your dumb ass was a better shot. [GASPS, SPEAKS ELVISH] - What she say? - She says the devil is coming. The devil's ass is out there in that wheelchair. - Let's go. On three. One... - Let's do it. - ...two... three. - Yeah. [WOMEN SCREAMING NEARBY] - [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE] - [GRUNTING] [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] [PEOPLE SCREAMING] [GRUNTS, SPUTTERS] [CHOKING, COUGHS] Oh, shit. - [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] - Go, go, go! Go! Go, go, go! Move! - [WARD] Go, go, go! - [JAKOBY] Go, go, go! [JAKOBY] Hurry! - LAPD! - [COPS GRUNTING] - [JAKOBY] Oh, fuck. Come on! - Who is she? [IN ELVISH] Inferni! She wants her Wand. Move! - [MAN SHOUTS] - [CRASHING] [THUNDER RUMBLES] [WARD GRUNTS] [JAKOBY] I'm not a cop after tonight, am I? No. Neither am I. I think we should probably spend our time - just trying to survive this shit. - Survive? [THUNDER RUMBLES IN DISTANCE] [SIGHS] Being a cop is all I've got. Right now I'm still a cop, and if I die tonight, I'll be a cop forever. I'll be a... I'll be a hero forever. Why the fuck do you wanna die for a world that doesn't give a shit about you? Orcs chose the wrong side a long time ago and they've been paying for it ever since. You know, when an Orc sees me... they see a man... a wannabee human. When humans see me, they see an animal. They hate me. [WARD] They don't hate you. [JAKOBY] We know when people like us and when they don't. Like you, Ward. When you came out of that house with pure hatred in your eyes. Pure... hatred. Look, I told you what that was, all right? Why didn't you tell me the truth about helping the Orc kid? I'm not saying it would've changed... anything, but, shit, it might have. I got confused. And with humans, you understand, everything is so definite. Like, you say something, and all of a sudden it's law, and you can't walk it back. You gotta tell me... if I'm supposed to be your partner. I don't care what we'll say to them, but you gotta tell me the truth. You can't lie to me. Oh, so I'm supposed to trust you when you don't trust me? That's a good point. [SIGHS] You're a good cop. And people are really hard on you, so... you're really hard on yourself. - [BEER CAN CLICKS OPEN] - [SHRIEKS] Come on, crazy. Ward, do you know that you are who I wish I was? You're fearless. You always know what to do. What you did tonight, that's what it takes for an Orc to get blooded. An act of great bravery. To me, you're like a blooded human. I used to be like you. Think you can save everybody and fix everything and... Now I just pretend to be a good dude. You still are one. Are we friends? Nah, Nick. We're not friends, man. You don't want me as a friend. [GRUNTS] [DOOR SQUEAKS, SHUTS] [CAN CLATTERS] [VEHICLE APPROACHING] [POLICE SIREN CHIRPS] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] Show me your fucking hands, Ward. Whoa, Rodriguez, what are you doing? Show me your fucking hands. - Hey! I called you. - Show me your fucking hands. - Are you a part of this? - Part of what? All I know is I heard chatter on the radio saying you killed a bunch of cops. - Put your gun down. Listen, the guys... - Shut the fuck up. - [JAKOBY] Hey! - Yo! Drop the weapon. - Tikka, stop. All right. Relax. - Drop the fucking weapon! Drop it now! - Rodriguez. Listen to me. - Get away from the gun! Listen! The guys on our watch tried to do us over a Wand. We have a Wand. We have a Magic Wand. - All right, show me the Wand. - Don't show him shit. - He's gonna shoot us and take it. - Slow. - [WARD] Jakoby! - [TIKKA GASPING] Shit. Okay, first thing we gotta do is keep that away from the bad guys. - I'm gonna make a phone call. Put it down. - All right. - Put it down. Now step back! - Rodriguez... Step the... God damn it! What the fuck? Is that an Elf? - Rodriguez, put the phone down. - Step the fuck back! - Put your phone down. - I'm calling the feds. - It's what we're supposed to do. - Listen to me. - Chill. Chill. Chill. - Listen. We don't know who's dirty. - Rodriguez, put the phone down. - Shut the fuck up. - Put the phone do... - Hold on! Don't tell 'em shit. I got a deputy claiming to have the Wand. Yes? They wanna know where we're at. Give me the phone. Give me the phone. Who is this? Who's this? The motherfucker with the Wand. [OVERLAPPING DIGITAL NOISE] [MALE ELF] You called us. Where are you? All right, look... I got the Wand, but I need something. - You need forgiveness. - If I give you this Wand. And let's just say... I don't know, somebody accused me of, uh, some dumb shit, like... killing a bunch of cops. A man like you could fix that shit, right? If you were protecting a weapon of magic from, let's say, corrupt individuals... there would be no charges. That's exactly what happened. Hypothetically. A man like you could dead that noise, right? - [MALE ELF] Do you have the Elf girl? - [WARD] Yeah. - [LINE CLICKS] - Yo. [ELECTRONIC BEEPS] [THUNDER CRASHES] - Can only narrow it down to a few blocks. - Okay. Come on, let's go! Move out! Move out! [ENGINES STARTING, REVVING] - The phone died. - Shit. - All right, look... - Okay. No, hold the... Hold the fuck up. - Hey, Rodriguez... - Have to cuff your partner. - Nobody's handcuffing anybody. - It doesn't look good. A fucking Orc and a bunch of dead cops? All right. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? I'm just being real with you, man. They want it to be Jakoby. Okay? Whether it's him or not. If he's not cuffed by the time they get here, they're gonna smoke both of you motherfuckers. - Cuff your partner. - Don't... - Ward, it's okay. - Don't reach on me like that. We can't run all night. Let's do it. - It's time to end this. - [THUNDER RUMBLING] Let's go in. - [TIKKA SPEAKS ELVISH] - [JAKOBY] Take my gun. Turn around. [JAKOBY] Hey, Ward... I can't go to prison. They'll skin me alive. You're not going to jail. You didn't do shit. I shot everybody. Ward, shut the fuck up and lawyer up. - [GUNSHOT] - Aah! [WARD] Get inside! Get inside! Go! - [ALL PANTING] - Shit. What was that? Good girl. Let me out. Let me out. You see anything? - [JAKOBY] No, I can't see anything. - Sir, get away from that window! - [GUNFIRE] - [MAN GRUNTS] - [WARD] Oh, shit! Move!

What'd I say? All right, look. I'm gonna cut you a break on the reckless driving. But I need you to return to your vehicles and drive home safely. So I need you to take your fat Shrek-looking ass back to your vehicle and drive the fuck home to Fiona. A'ight? - Do you wanna go to jail? - [SOFTLY] Fiona? Tell these dickheads in Orkish to get the fuck back in their vehicles and drive home, - or they're all going to jail. - But... they speak English. But... You understand, right? Speak English? [OVERLAPPING IN ENGLISH] Yeah. Of course. [YELLING] [ALL GRUNTING] [ORCS YELLING] [MALE ORC] Take 'em to the church! [WARD AND JAKOBY GRUNTING] [IN ENGLISH] You know... I'm not from here. I grew up in Miami. Great Orc communities there, strong Orc communities. We'd have block parties with dwarves and humans. [CHUCKLES] It was fucking fun, man. [EXHALES] I wasn't in the game then. I was a bus driver. Then I moved to LA. Fucking City of Angels, right? Listen, I would really appreciate it if you gave me the respect of looking at me when I'm talking to you. I get here and I see how broke the system is. Orcs caught between the police and the gangsters. Elves making money off us. - So I organize... - [WHISPERS] Tikka. ...my community. We got our own thing now. - [SIGHS] - Every month... - Look at me, motherfucker. - [GRUNTS] Sorry. Every month... I throw a big party. Get everyone drunk, feed 'em. All races... partying together, with one rule. No guns. After years of peace... who brings in the guns? We did, yeah. - The drama? - Us. Disrespects our celebration? The motherfucking police! [IN ORKISH] An unblooded Orc. Grew up with humans. Never had a hand raised for him in respect. - What's he saying? - [JAKOBY SIGHS] - [LEADER IN ORKISH] Playing the nice guy. - Nothing I haven't heard before. [IN ENGLISH] Your buddy's so happy to say he's got a Orc friend. Shit. I'm stuck with this motherfucker. - Seriously? - I'm just saying, ain't like we's stomping through the club together. Ward. [IN ORKISH] Where is the Wand? What Wand? - [IN ENGLISH] Hey, man, we're family. - [WARD] Hey, Nick. He's just trying to get in your head. Don't let him in your head. I'm not trying to get in his head, man. I'm in his soul. We're the same thing. - I'll tell you where the Wand is. - Yeah? It's up your fucking ass. - [EXHALES] - [LOW MURMURS IN CROWD] Where's the Wand? [SIGHS] Whip these motherfuckers. [BOTH GRUNTING] [GASPING SOBS] [GRUNTING] [IMPACT THUDS, GRUNTS CONTINUE] - [MALE ORC] Get them! - [BOTH GROANING] [LEADER] Don't hurt 'em. Pussy.

[JAKOBY MOANS] [SOFT GROAN] Altamira thinks there's a Wand. The police think there's a Wand. The feds think there's a Wand. I think there's a Wand! [WARD] There's no Wand. Ghetto Fairy tales. [GRUNTING, GROANS] [LEADER] Bring me the Elf. [TIKKA GRUNTING] I will cover you with her hot blood. She don't have shit to do with this. [LEADER] Where is the Wand? We are police off... officers. And you can't do this to us. [IN ORKISH] Kill them! [IN ENGLISH] Watch your friends die, Elf. [GRUNTS, PANTING] [LOW VIBRATIONS] [LEADER] You didn't break. You deserve to be blooded. [GROANS] You would have made a great Orc. [BREATHING HEAVILY] I am... a great Orc. [GROANS] My son earns his colors tonight. Mikey. [GROANS] [CHAMBERS ROUND] [WHISPERS] Bye, partner. [LEADER IN ORKISH] Why are you waiting? Father... I know him. [IN ENGLISH] Ward... [MIKEY IN ORKISH] He helped me escape from the police. [IN ENGLISH] That's the guy... that I let go. He saved my life. I cannot kill him. [IN ENGLISH] Go home. You can't be here. [SOBBING] [GASPING] Fuck you, you green pig-nose piece of shit. Shoot, bitch. - Beg for it! Beg! - Shoot me, bitch.

What happened? Uh... Nothing. Why? Well, something happened. I feel great. [WARD] Uh... - [STAMMERS] Nah, just go, go, go. - [JAKOBY] Okay. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [WARD] You're a Bright? You're a fucking Bright? Would've been nice to know that when we was getting fucked up. Could've had a magic helicopter take us somewhere. [IN ENGLISH] I only started my training. I only know a few spell words. She speaks English pretty good now, too. - Now I trust you. - [WARD] Um... You gonna need to unfuck this, okay? A'ight? You gonna magic us to Palm Springs or some shit. I saved your friend's life. Isn't that enough? It's a start, but... Uh, Ward, stop. I happen to think it's a pretty big deal. Thank you. Now, Tikka, who are these Elves who are hunting us? They're aiding the return of the Dark Lord... so he can slaughter billions and enslave the survivors to serve him in a new age of magic. Oh. That's all. Just some Illuminati shit. They're Inferni. They destroyed the Illuminati a hundred years ago. How do you know all this? I, too, am Inferni. But I escaped. [CHANTING] The Shield of Light hid me. Leilah gave an assassin her Wand to kill me. But I got the Wand from her. [SCREAMS] Keep it away from Leilah. She mustn't get her Wand back. With it, she can restore the Dark Lord to power. Hey, what is that? What's the shit? What's the black stuff? - [COUGHING, GASPING] - [WARD] Hey. Look... All right. All right, hey, look, don't-don't-don't check out on us. [GASPS] Keep it away from her. Keep the Wand away from Leilah. - Promise me. - Yes. All right. She needs medical attention. We gotta get her to an emergency room. - [JAKOBY] But how? - [PANTING] [ENGINE STARTS] Got it. Let's go! Go, go! We won't let you die. How do we save you? Only the Shield of Light can help me. Where are they? Home. - Home. - [WARD] Home? Where's home? Wait, home. [STAMMERS] Uh... the Abrams' house? Everybody was dead there. There's a pool. The pools are... connected like... the roots of a holy tree. Ward, she's dying. We have to take her back to where we found her. - No. We are not going back to that house. - Yes. We're gonna get to the hospital. There's doctors there. We're gonna turn her and the Wand over to the feds. - Ward. Ward. - I want my life back. She brought me back from the dead. Hey, don't kook out on me right now, all right? We don't know exactly what happened. You have to accept the miracle. - We're not going back to that house. - You and me are simple people. We mean nothing. People don't write about us. But this, don't you see, is like a time of heroes? Jirak was unblooded like me. An Orc that nobody cared about. He... He united the Nine Armies, and they defeated the Dark Lord. He... He was a farmer who changed the world. They raised their blades to him. He was blooded in that very moment. He fulfilled a great Prophecy, Ward. I think we might be in a Prophecy. - We're not in a Prophecy, all right? - How do you know? We're in a stolen Toyota Corolla. - No. - Okay? Look at my face. - All right? This is not a Prophecy face. - [THUNDER RUMBLING] This is a bad-night face. Okay? And we're gonna get to the hospital, and the feds are gonna put an end to it. Shut the fuck up, Ward, and listen to me. We have to go back. There's nothing ahead of us. [SIGHS] [WARD] Ah, man. These guys are feds. [JAKOBY] Oh, shit. [TIKKA GASPS, COUGHS] [CHUCKLES] I get the big gun. Ah. I didn't mind having the big gun. [SOFTLY] That... That's a bomb. Yes, it is. - You want me to hold it? - Yes, I do. W... Why? You never know. [LEILAH IN ELVISH, VOICE ECHOING] I sit before you, Lord of Darkness. Serving your will is my honor. I will return you to this world. [GASPS] They're coming! There! In the wall! Shoot through the wall! - [GRUNTING] - Ward! [GRUNTS] [WARD GRUNTING] - [JAKOBY GRUNTS, GROANS] - [SHOUTS] [GROANS] - Nick! [SHOUTS] - [WOMAN GRUNTS] [SHOUTING] - [GRUNTS] - Nick! Let's go! Jakoby! [SHOUTS] [GROANS, YELLING] I gave her the bomb. You never know. Swipe left. - [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS] - [HIGH-PITCHED CHARGE] - [GRUNTS] - [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] [GRUNTS, GROANS] [WARD] Oh, shit. - [TIKKA GASPS] - [GRUNTING] [WARD SHOUTS] [GRUNTING] [YELLS, GRUNTS] - [GASPS, SHRIEKS] - [WARD GROWLS] - [SHOUTING] - [GRUNTS] [WARD SHOUTS] [SCREAMS] - [WARD] Shoot her! - [SCREAMING] [SHOUTS IN ELVISH] - [CONTINUES SCREAMING] - Shoot her! Nick, will you please shoot her! - Shoot! Shoot her! - [SHRIEKING] [GASPS] Good work. [WHIMPERS, BREATH TREMBLING] - [TIKKA] The water. Put me in the water. - [JAKOBY GRUNTS] Hey. You're done. I got it from here. [JAKOBY GROANS] So what now? Have faith. [WHISPERS] She's coming. Nick! [GRUNTS] [CHOKING] [HIGH-PITCHED RINGING] [GASPS] [WARD SHOUTS] [TIKKA GROANS] [GASPING] The hell are you? I'm a warrior. A priestess, a lover. I am whatever my Lord needs me to be. [TIKKA GASPING] [LEILAH IN ELVISH] Come home. Please, come home. - [WARD GRUNTS] - [TIKKA IN ELVISH] I can't go back. Dream with me again. What you love is broken, rotten. [LEILAH IN ENGLISH] This man and the Orc... - [GRUNTING] - ...what are they to you? - They're good. - [WHISPERS] No. [GRUNTING] [GASPING] [TIKKA WHIMPERS] - It's time to come home. - [WHIMPERING SOBS] [LEILAH] It's time to come home. - [TIKKA] It's too late. I can't come home. - [LEILAH] It's time to wake up. [SOBS, SHRIEKING] [PANTING] - [IN ELVISH] So just shut up and kill me. - [LEILAH MOANS] [IN ENGLISH] Just shut up and kill me! - [LEILAH] This is not you! - [TIKKA] Shut up and kill me! This is not you! This is you! What have you done to my sister? What have you done to her? What did you do? [LEILAH SHRIEKS, GASPING] Shit. Nick, if you were aiming at the Wand, that was a really good shot. But shoot her in her head! Like this? - [CLICKS] - [SIGHS] I can't. I'm out. [SIGHS] - [GRUNTS] - [LEILAH, ECHOING] No! You're not a Bright. You touch my Wand... and it will splatter you all over the walls. [WARD] I think that's kind of the plan. Think I'mma just kill us all. Ward... I wouldn't do that. It's all right. We're in a Prophecy, right? [WARD SCREAMS] Oh... Oh! This is impossible. [WARD GROANS] Hey, Nick, I got the Wand. Um, what now? Maybe you're a... You're a Bright, Ward. Use it! Oh, good idea. Give it to me... or she dies. Vykwarus. The war word is Vykwarus. Vykwarus! - [SCREAMING] - [SHRIEKING] We got a Bright in there! Aah! Tikka. Tikka. - Tikka! - Ward! It's okay. - She just... She rolled in. - Come on, Ward! - She's gone. It's okay. - I didn't hurt her. - Tikka! - Ward, Tikka's okay. She's gone. - Tikka! - Ward, think of Sophia. Come on, Ward! [BOTH GROANING] [COUGHS] [ALL SHOUTING] [MAN] Orc! Stand down. Stand down. Ward! Ward! [JAKOBY SOBS] No! Daryl! You're safe now. Ward! [SHOUTS] Daryl! Ward! [GASPING] Ward! [SIRENS WAILING] [JAKOBY] I know. I gotcha. [JAKOBY COUGHING] [GASPING] Got him! Ward! [COUGHING] We made it! We got out! I got you. You're okay. Are you okay? [PANTING] Breathe, Ward. Say something. Nick... look. Oh. [SHOUTING] - [COUGHING] - [WARD] Still not my friend. [JAKOBY GRUNTS] I never really liked you anyway. [COUGHS] Think you're a big dog now you're blooded, huh? - [APPROACHING SIRENS] - Yeah, pretty big. Hey, Nick. [JAKOBY] Yeah. [WARD] Fuck magic. [JAKOBY] Well, I don't know. I still think it's kinda cool. [RESPONDERS CHATTERING] [MAN] How you doing, fellas? - Good? - [WARD] Hey. - Nick, the firemen are here. - [JAKOBY GRUNTS] - [WARD] We should've been firemen. - [JAKOBY] Yeah. - [WARD] Hey, can I get a aspirin? - [JAKOBY GRUNTS] [MACHINES BEEP STEADILY] Hey, Clan Blood. Daryl. Oh, Daryl. How are you feeling? You feeling okay? Uh, yeah. Okay, I get it. Oh, shit. Well, that can't be good. Yeah. Why you not locked up? I think they think you're more dangerous than me. [WARD] Hey. Don't say shit. - Sir, we were just responding to a call. - [WARD] Mmm. My partner and I, we... But there was all this crazy magic stuff. I mean, everything that happened with Brown... - Hey, hey, hey. - ...and Hicks and Pollard and Ching... - They wanted Officer Ward to shoot me. - Hey. Nick. They wanted to him to kill me so they could get the Wand, remember? And he wouldn't do it 'cause he's a stand-up guy. He wouldn't do it. But then they said they would kill me, so he... he had to take action, - like, with his gun, right? - No. That's not my recollection. - [SIGHS] - Hey, Nick, why don't you just... If you hold up a second... - What? - ...they'll ask us questions. It's what happened, I swear to God. We just returned to the call. But there are forces at play that are beyond. - There was, uh, an Elf woman. - Hey, Nick. She owned the Wand. Right? It must've been hers. Not a nice lady. Dressed very well, but... Like you. But she was a terrible woman. She... - Uh, she served the Dark Lord. - Nick... - I know it. - Let them... - Let them ask us questions. - They need to know this. - Let him ask us questions. - There was an Angel. All right. That was then when the gangsters were chasing us. - [WARD] Uh, the context is a little off. - [JAKOBY] Tikka. Oh, Tikka. [TSKS] So sad. [STAMMERS] Tikka... Tikka was a young Bright. She... She... She... She... She used the Wand and she saved my life. I was... My soul was leaving my body, and she brought me back. Officer Ward? We responded to a 415 disturbance call. Uh, upon approaching the residence, we realized that it was a safe house - for an extremist group. - Full of weird... We immediately took fire, uh, at which point we called for backup. And... unfortunately... - officers were killed in the exchange. - I've never seen shooting like it. He turned around, sight unseen, four of them, bang, bang, bang, bang. Dropped... like it was one bullet. Sorry, keep going. Gangsters showed up, and it just went really sideways from that point. And had you guys not shown up... it would've... it would've been really bad. Uh, so the real heroes in this are you guys. So we wanna say thank you. Nick, thank the nice federal agents. Thank you. So, let me say, unequivocally... there was no Wand. And there was no magic. Just a couple of street cops... doing our job. [SOFTLY] Oh, I know what this is. Then that's what happened? Yes, sir. That's exactly what happened. Yes? No, I'm with him. Unequivocally. [SOFT GRUNT] Faced with armed terrorists obsessed with myths from thousands of years ago, two of our officers held the line. [SOFTLY] I hate seeing those scumbags up there with Rodriguez. [WHISPERS] Let it go, Ward. We know, okay? That's enough. Officer Daryl Ward, and our nation's first Orkish police officer, Nicholas Jakoby. Officer Jakoby.
