This is such a cool place, Celene. - Yes, and I like it exactly the way it is so take a mental picture. Alberta, this arrangement, this two-week arrangement can not cause me any trouble. I mean, zero. Understand? - What kind of trouble? - Your kind of trouble. You were always jumping out of one mess into another. - That was a long time ago. - We're adults now. I'm not your babysitter anymore. - And I'm not a helpless kid. I promise. - So, what's your first move then? What's your life plan? You don't have one. - Life plan.

I, I, look, just tell me how much it costs. I'll pay you back - $800, and I need to wear this for an appointment tonight! Geez. Don't insult me acting like you can come up with that scratch, part timer. God! - [Alberta] It's just one appointment though, right? - [Celene] Yeah, one that happens to coincide with the very big bills that need to be paid tomorrow. - [Alberta] I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. I swear. I just, I didn't know your hooker outfits cost so much. - [Celene] What did you just call me? - Hooker. I heard hooker. [slaps] - I'm doing what I want and you have the nerve to call me... You wreck my shit and then label me... You've really changed, Alberta. Not at all the fuck-up I remember. - Celene? [door closes] [slaps] What about an advance? - Oh, they don't give advances, dear. You'll be full-time before you know it, then you can get benefits. - I don't need benefits, Penelope. I need money. I need it now. - Mm, dear, what happened? Fall in with the wrong crowd or stalker? - No. Why would I... What about extra shifts with the manager? - Lance is a cheapskate, honey. And he's a man, he cheats on his wife. - Seriously? - That's what I've been telling people. Why not just go home? - Absolutely not. Put me on the night cleaning crew. I don't care.

I find this taping thing a bit ridiculous. Uh, sorry. Um, I, I'm not sure what, how this is supposed to go, but, I'd like to try giving up control for once, if that's okay. - Hi Paul? This is Celene. Uh, we... I can meet your needs. Meet me at the Cedarlane Mall food court at seven o'clock tonight. I want you to wear white pants. I command it.

Lovely place, east. - Yeah. Well, you know, I'd vacation south, and I traveled north. - Now you're west. - And now I'm west. - West is the best. - That is exactly what I am beginning to figure out. - What are you smiling at? - Nothing.

Did I do something wrong, did I- - No. You were great. I dominated you. We're done. So pay me. [Paul scoffs] - You're the boss. What about, what about another 300? Like my place? Slightly less of an audience. [Paul barking] - What are you doing? [people laugh] [Paul barking] Get up. - No. Not until you say yes. [Paul barking] - Yes, yes. Get up! Yes! - Okay. That's me. Oh, don't worry. I'm good for the cash. I just uh, I hit it big at a casino. I got a great poker face. Hey, if you're uncomfortable or something, that's... - It's an extra 50 for house calls. - Okay.

And she's into kinky shit. Double happiness. - This is okay, Celene. It's okay. - Celene. Beautiful name. Strong. I'm Paul's boss, Rene. No doubt he's mentioned me. [tense music] So, Paul, I don't think I did a very good job in taking my own advice, drawing that line, business and personal. I shouldn't have accused you like that, I apologize. Completely unprofessional. Oh. - Rene. - I just apologized for disrespecting you. Don't you think this might be- - I didn't do anything, Rene. You made me fear for my life. - Or you will duck and hide across the country? - I'm gonna go. Okay? - No, you know what? No, no. I think that Rene should go. Uh, you're, you're, you're freaking out my girlfriend. Both of us. You freaking both of us out. - You're crawling on the floor wearing a leash, and I'm freaking you out? We need to resolution so we can go back to the way things were. [tense music] - What's with the girl? - Don't be rude. We're guests. - Right. - So what are you supposed to be, sweetheart? - Dominatrix. [men laugh] - Hey, guys. Why don't we just leave her out of this, okay? - It looks like she's got him on a short le- - You tell me where it is right now. I'll order them off you. - I think what he's asking, Paul, in a nice way, in a way that I won't, is where the fuck is it? - [Paul] Rene, I did not take your money. I told you then and I'm telling you now. Stop being an idiot. [belt slaps] - You're dumb. Well we had no idea Paul liked pain so much. Let's get a demonstration. - Just leave her out of it. Why can't we just leave her out of it? Come on, I didn't not take the money, Rene! [Paul grunts] - Pull those up. No one needs to see that. - No, it's gonna hurt more on his bare- - [Rene] Pull them up. - The club loses half a mill, and you dart across the country? Huh? You think Renee is that stupid? [hits] [Paul grunts] Huh? [smacking] [Paul yelling] [tense, dramatic music] Help us out, mistress. - No. [slaps] - You. Now you're gonna help me. - No. - No, no, come on. Rene. Rene, make him stop. No, no, no, no. - No. - Don't, Rene! Do- [Paul screaming] - I'm sorry? - It's in is closet. - It's in his closet. Thank you. [Paul whimpering] Did that excite you, hm? - [Rene] Maybe 20 grand here. - Rene. Rene, that is not, that is not your money, Rene. - He won it at the casino. - The casino? You, Paul? You have a gambling problem? - It's not a problem if you're winning, Aaron, you fucking idiot. You're even stupider than your stupid fucking brother. What, am I confusing you? Am I talking too fast? Time in the joint dull your sense, Aaron? [hits] [Paul grunts] [hitting] [grunting] - Stop! Stop! Get off him! Paul. Come on, Paul. - [Aaron] Rene, I'm sorry, but you know he wasn't talking. - How's he supposed to talk now, dickhead? - I thought that's what you wanted! [hits] [Aaron grunts] - Stop!

I do need to know where you are. Can you- - I don't know where. - [Phone Operator] Okay, I can send someone to you. I just- - I'm sorry. - [Phone Operator] Ma'am- [soft, tense music] - [Alberta] I need to find this guy. I need help. Whoa. Man. - Let me guess, you hit a little adversity, and suddenly you're what? Back to the jackass in Coledale? - I don't know. - Where'd that come from? - I got an advance. It doesn't matter. It's for the outfit. - What is going on? Alberta? - I met this guy, Paul... And I went to his place, and these friends of his, they came over and they beat on him badly, and so I ran. I just, I need to know, I need to know if he's okay. - How'd you meet this guy? - At the food court. - Classy. He pick you up? [Alberta scoffs] - [Alberta] Sort of. - Can he get ahold of you? Find you? - No. No way. - Good. You're learning to take precautions like me. [Alberta laughs] Okay? - Oh, I have his cell phone number. - [Celene] And? - Well, I can call him and if he's conscious, he can pick up. - Forget it. - Well, I can't. I need to tell the police. - Look... You just said you don't know where he lives, so where are you going? - I don't know. - Okay, just... You're going to be fine. Believe it, okay? - Okay. - Okay? - Okay. [phone dialing] [line trilling] [soft music] [banging] [phone ringing] - It's spring time. I should be out on Saint-Laurent sipping gin. [banging] [tense music] Not doing a very good job of looking out for you, am I? - The rest of the money's not here. - I'm going to go finish this. You two are staying here. And if anything happens to Paul when I'm gone, you're both responsible. - No, but Aaron was- - Both of you. - Got something to say to me, Issac? You worthless fucking Neanderthal. - No. Sir.

Oh, uh Penelope mentioned seeing you in some outfit. Hey, no judgment. You gotta do what you gotta do.

I mean, who the hell would want to be dominated by an Alberta? Did you honestly think I wouldn't find you? So tell me where the rest is. My half million. - What? I don't know anything about. - You pay for this place on a grocery store salary? Are you telling me Paul didn't share the wealth with his skanky sweetheart? - No, he didn't. Is Paul okay? - I'm concerned. Everyone goes through a rebellious stage, but he's making a lot of poor choices lately. Lying to me, acting like a dog. One thing I've never had to coach him on much is women. It reminds me of me at his age. I mean, he's been in town what, a few weeks? If that. And he's already swung your- [Alberta gasps] Maybe I should call my security detail? - No. - Have them come over and teach you a- [door unlocks] [Alberta gasps] [man vocalizing] [hits] [clattering] [tense, dramatic music] [Alberta choking] - Another outfit of mine you ruined.

Sorry. Coffee? - And that you stashed it in my home. Black. Thank you. - [Alberta] Again. Sorry. - And that they had a way of finding you and busting... You're paying for that vase, ass fuck! What I'm saying here is that you didn't exactly tell me everything. You may find it nit-picky, but to me having prior knowledge of these things would fall under the category of good to know. - I totally agree. And Celene? It won't happen again. [Celene laughing] - You said that when you were seven and I caught you eating cat food. [sniffles] [clears throat] So why'd you take the cash anyway? - I don't know. It was just a big bag of money.

We can split the $20,000. - Stop talking now. The house was trashed total and you're talking about what? - Well, won't insurance cover it? - It's not my house. [tires squeal] [thudding] [Rene yelling] It's a client's place. I'm house sitting for a year. Poorly. Saving a bit of money. [Celene chuckles] Guess that didn't work out too well for me, huh? I barely cover my own debts. And, and... Fuck! - I'll make this up to you, I promise. There's more money. - Just don't. Okay? - I'm serious. The guy in the truck's convinced that Paul ripped him off and 20,000 is only part of half a million. [tires squealing] [thudding] - I don't have to explain anything to you. He's a new client- - Okay, fine. Sure, I understand he's a new client, but why'd you have to bring him here? - This is, this is our private- - He's an extreme case and needs extreme confinement. - I have...

No. Stay put and do not, do not not even think about going in that room. Are we clear?

[Rene grunting] [Alberta exhales deeply] [soft, tense music] I have a handkerchief in my pocket. [soft, tense music] - So tell me about this money. - It's mine. Paul took it. Handkerchief. - You need to know if your employee Paul betrayed you? I need to know if my boyfriend's been lying to me since day one. - He was my right hand protege. Smart like me. Taught him everything about my club. Alarm codes and the safe was at its fullest, and when I confronted him about it, he ran across the country. - That son of a bitch. [sighs] [soft, tense music] - Thank you. Shows what a good heart you have. - Don't try and play me, okay? I'm not stupid. - Of course you're not. Paul has good taste. You met him and instantly felt unworthy, right? Wanted to seem exotic. Tough. So you pretended to be your leather-bound roommate? You shouldn't. I hear how she talks to you. Listen... We have a situation here. My security detail, Isaac, has been looking for an excuse to end Paul for a long time now. [Alberta laughs] - They can kill that lying prick for all I care. - Well, maybe I misjudged you. - You seem very involved in his life. - Came to me with nothing. I've guided him. - [Alberta] Like a father? So who's this then? - Put that way. - Your son? - I lost him. He's gone now. - I'm sorry. - Then untie me. I'll feel better. [Alberta laughs] - [Isaac] This isn't about the fucking keys, it's about you showing me respect. [Isaac and Aaron yelling] - [Aaron] I want to go home, Isaac. I want to go home, okay? - [Isaac] Go the fuck home okay... - I wanna go back home. - Fine. You wanna go home to mommy, you little bitch? You go home to mommy. - Can you be so sure those two lunk heads of yours haven't found it already and puckered off? - We checked the house. It's clean. And they wouldn't dare. I know my people. - [Aaron] Isaac, he's getting worse. - He's fine. - No, I can't get in, I can't up back in jail. - Then don't. - We need to get him to hospital. - That's not the job. - Well, I think the job is sort of over when the target ends up in a coma. - If I'm even going to consider letting you go, I need to know the brothers won't come after me once I get my share. - Let's just say I have a very strong hold on Isaac, okay? - [Alberta] What does that mean? - He's a wanted man. I use my connections to keep him out of jail, and Isaac controls Aaron, so... - [Alberta] Didn't do a very good job of controlling Aaron last night. - That wasn't my fault. - I wanna go, Isaac, okay? I wanna go now. Like you promised, like we've planned. We can drive south and tell someone. - When they called like an hour ago, he said it's- - He called? Well, were you ever going to tell me? - He tracked the leather slut, he's getting the money back. He's probably dropping her into oblivion as we speak. - Okay, well, why don't we take Paul in and we can get the out of here, then? - Not without word. - Okay, fuck Rene's word, okay? Let's just fucking go, okay? I want to go now. - Aaron's not a problem. A couple of years back, Isaac got backed into a corner. They were telling him to take the fall. Aaron willingly did two year's hard time. Won't even take a piss unless Isaac gives the okay. Isaac controls Aaron, I control Isaac. - You listen here, shithead. Rene tracked Paul across the country. You think if we bail, he'll just forget about us, huh? Especially if his precious little protege over there croaks because of you? We're on the clock here, kid. We stay with this job. [slaps] - Fuck! [tense rock music] [crashing] [thudding] [Aaron and Isaac yelling] I'm gonna tell mom. - Yeah, you know what? Go ahead, tell me. Guess what? You're fucking adopted. - [Aaron] I am not. I am not adopted! [thudding] [grunting] [hits] [Aaron grunts] Fuck you, Isaac. [hits] [Aaron grunts] [grunting] Fuck you. Aw, great. Best shirt ever, and now look, Isaac. Mom got me this for Christmas. - Well, then go home and mom'll fix it! - Fine, I will. - You fucking baby. [Aaron sobbing] - You're close to making a good decision here, Alberta. [knocking] All you need to do is follow through. For Paul. - What in Sam fucking Hell is going on in here? - Get rid of her. [Alberta sighs] - [Alberta] What if your problem? - I don't know what kind of shit he's pulling, but god, stop being so naive. - Is Paul okay? Did you see him? - He's alive. Still in the house playing possum. What are you- - I think we can do this. - Do what? - We scatter the brothers, we get Paulie's ticket to half a million. - What is the matter with you? - If it all worked out, the younger brother's completely useless without the older one so if we get them separate- Celene. Listen. - No, you listen. Those two guys are freaking nut bars. They're insane times 20. - We can take 'em. - Oh, Alberta. - Stop that. I hate it when you use the condescending tone. I'm trying to help here. - Yeah, I don't need your help. - I think you do. Now listen, I just spent a lot of time trying to get that guy to trust me. - You got him to talk? - Yeah. So I figure if we help Paul, he'll be willing to share his score. With his rescuers. - Why are you doing all of this? - I said, I'd make this up to you. I don't know, what's wrong with wanting to help Paul a little bit, too? [ripping] - Alberta! I really need to urinate! - [Alberta] You have my permission. - We were close to a deal. - Thought we agreed I wasn't stupid. [Rene chuckles] - This is ridiculous. Okay. Stop it, Alberta, I mean it. Alberta, Isaac will eat you alive. He'll kill you and Paul. You can't do this. - Yes, I can. [ripping] [Rene grunts] [Alberta laughs] [heavy breathing] [soft, tense music] [birds chirping] [soft, tense music] [footsteps approaching] [glass shatters] - Please, mom, don't. [soft, tense music] [car door closes] [tires squeal] [soft, tense music] [birds chirping] - What is it? Isaac, what does that even mean? - It means Renee's been scalped. [phone ringing] [Aaron and Isaac grumbling] - Hello? - [Isaac] God- [grunting] Yeah? - [Alberta] Hi. Can I speak with Paul, please? - Uh... He's unavailable. Who's this? - Who is it? [slaps] - [Alberta] Oh, so he's still on the floor? - You ran off so quickly the other day. - [Alberta] Cedarlane Mall, food court, in a half hour. - Who is it? - How about you come here? Now. - I'm sure it would delight Rene to know that his employees have so little regard for his life. Take Paul's cell and don't be late. - Let me say something. [birds chirping] - [Alberta] I don't think he bought it. - He'll show up. Dress. Okay, so as we agreed. - Act like I'm in control. Got it. - No. Keep him on the phone. Do not poke the bear. Do not engage. Okay? - Okay. - See you at Spencer's in an hour. - Can I go with you? - No. - Why? - Come here. Look at me. Someone has to stay here, okay? In case he wakes up. That's gotta be you. Come on, when have I ever steered you wrong, huh? That's right. Good. Okay? Now, just trust me. Stay here, watch him and don't screw up. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. - How long are you going to be? - As long as it takes for me to snap that bitch's neck. Okay? - Yeah. - All right. - Come here. For good luck. [birds chirping] [knocking] [knocking] - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey wait. You can't just, you know, walk in here- - Look, I'm on call. I only have a few minutes. Told Rene I'd check on your friends, so where is he? - Okay, Um... Rene's been... When did you talk to him? - Last night? What's it matter? I'm here now, so move it. Fine. From what he said, the guy's probably done for by now anyway. - Okay, wait. Yeah. It's very important that he wakes up. - I'm going to need some clean towels soaked in ice water. - All right. - Hey. - Oh, now? - Hey, Paul, are you still with us? - Here's your towel. Who are you talking to? - Tea towels, imbecile. Tea towels. - Oh, okay.

He needs a hospital. [slaps] Listen, if this guy expires on you, you're totally fucked. You up for that? - Look, I understand what you're saying, lady, but I can't because my brother- - He's your boss? - No. Rene is. - If Rene didn't wanna help, he wouldn't have called me in a panic, would he, right? - No. - Right? - Yeah. - Good. Let's move already. - Okay. Which hospital are we going to go to? Well, I'm going to go, too. You didn't think that Rene would just let Paul slip away like that? - Can't be at my hospital under my care. - You know, I never did get your name. - Is that really fucking important right now? - Yes. I think it, it is. - Buddy, you better stop this right now. If Rene finds- - What the fuck? Oh hey. Paul, hey. Nice to see ya. Why don't we go back inside? Hey, what are you doing? Lady, he's going to stay with me a little bit longer. - Let go. I'm a fucking nurse, you moron. [grunting] [hits] [Paul grunts] - Oh, ah shit. - Geez. - Help him. [hits] [Celene grunting] [birds chirping] [Aaron grunting] [people chattering] [soft music] [security radio chatter] - I'm not afraid of you. - No? - I'm not afraid. I outsmarted you once before at Paul's. - You dined and dashed like some punk kid. - And what makes you think I can't do it again? - Because I said so... [people chattering] Because I said so, you fucking bitch. So I suggest that you tell me where Rene is ultra quick before I get- - You know, Rene's not such a bad guy when you get to know him. He tells me that back east you're a wanted man. And not just from women's rights groups. [people chattering] - You know, this act you're pulling... - It's not an act. I have your boss. I know where the half a million is. I still have the original 20,000, and one phone call from me gets you sent back east for hard time. So next time, I'd think twice about hitting a wo- - Do you know something, slut? [splashing] [man laughs] - I would like an apology for that remark. - You can fuck right off. [people chattering] - [Man] She's way too hot. [people chattering] [soft music] - I'm sorry. That you're a slut. [people chattering] That I called you... A slut. - You're not sorry enough. Not yet. [soft rock music] - Hey, thanks for, thanks for trying to help me. - It wasn't for you, pal. It was for me and my friend. Your dominatrix. I'm Celene. - You're... You're... So she's? - Alberta. - She's Alberta. Alberta. [clangs] Ow. Is she seeing anyone, do you know? - Oh, drop the shit, all right? Look, when we get out of here, we want part of the stash that you stole from Rene. - Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I- - Look, I get it. You lied so that- - No, I'm not lying. There's no money. I'm sorry if you feel like you risked a lot or something. Sorry, but... [toilet flushes] Don't worry. I think Alberta's gonna help us. [door opens] - Oh, man. I'm glad you're not uh, you know, dead. I was worried about you. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - You should worry, Aaron, because if any more shit goes down, Rene will leave you in the dust. - Oh, I don't know about that. [spraying] You're the one who ripped him off. - God, I did not... Oh, Christ. You think Rene's never gotten anything wrong in his life? - No, no, no. Rene is a very smart businessman, all right? He's been there for me whenever I've been sad. - Oh yeah? How did he help you when you were in jail, Aaron? Or Isaac? And I was at the club with them, and they were not helping you. They were laughing at you, like, all the time. - Aaron, just take him to the hospital. You're free and clear. - All right, no more talking between you two. - Aaron, Aaron, I know this is- - No, Paul, shut your mouth, okay? My brother is my brother and yeah, he's a dick sometimes, most of the time, I know that, but I... He loves me. Okay? And he would never hurt me. So just shut your filthy goddamn mouth. - No. [Celene grunts] [Celene grunting] Shut up, Paul! [people chattering] [gentle music] - Too many people so don't even try anything. - Sweetheart, when I decide to try, you'll know. - I'm curious, what's someone like you called? Do you have a title? - What, are we getting to know each other now? Security expert. [people chattering] [Alberta laughs] - Security expert? - I do my job. I do it well. I can't control every stupid teenage girl- - Oh, so it's everybody else's fault? - Shut up. I practically run Rene's business. He'd be lost without me. - Without Paul, you mean? - Let me tell you something, we'll all be a lot better off when that guy's gone. Who knows, that may have happened already. - Tell me something, why hasn't Rene ever suspected you and Aaron? [Isaac laughs] I mean, if you know everything, like when the safe is at its fullest, all the security and alarm codes, why couldn't you have taken the money and fingered Paul? - Look down. We're leaving. - Excuse me, sir? Would you mind turning around, please? - You gotta be fucking kidding me. Look, this doesn't concern you, okay? - I think you should let go of her. - Why don't you give me some distance so I can take care of this bitch, okay, pork pie? - Let her go, sir. [clattering] Gun! [grunting] [gunshots] [people exclaiming] Call the police! - [Isaac] Fuckers! [grunting] - [Man] Hold him, get the gun away. - [Isaac] Fuck you! Don't you dare! Don't you dare! Fuckin' kill you! [grunting] I'm gonna fucking kill you, bitch! [electronic pop music] - Make sure you tell the cops he's a wanted man. - I'll fucking kill you, bitch! You- [choking] [electronic pop music] - [Alberta] Thanks, Penelope! [electronic pop music] [sirens blaring] [electronic pop music] Where's the money, where's the money? [tires squeal] [electronic pop music] - [Officer] Stop resisting, stop resisting. Get in the car. Come on, come on, get your head down. [Isaac yells] [electronic pop music] [thudding] - [Alberta] Crap. [tires squeal] [electronic pop music] Celene, you're not going to believe what happened. [soft, upbeat piano music] Celene? [soft, upbeat piano music] Spencer? What the hell happened? - I didn't mean to scare the guy. I meant to frighten him a little. I was just playing around. The bald guy, the bald guy. He's crazy. - Where's Celene? - I've never seen a submissive so terrified of male nudity in all my life. Kept calling me a freak. I'm not a freak. Everything was fine until you came along. You've wrecked everything. Hey. Where are you going? Wait a minute. - I have to do something. He might hurt Celene. - Wait, look, stay here and don't- - Spencer! - You do as I say and get in the car. Celene needs our help. [tires squeal] - Come on Isaac. Pick up the phone. [dog barking in the distance] Isaac. [dog barking in the distance] Rene? Wow you uh... You okay? Hey, look, we found your hair. Here. - Paul awake? - Yeah, yep. He did Isaac get your back? - Bring him out. [tense rock music] [tools clattering] You really should have stayed out of this, officer. [crunching] [Celene yells] - Do we even know where this guy lives? - Stop yelling. - Oh, you stop yelling. - There it is! - Watch where you're going! [honking] - Hey! [crashing] [dog barking in the distance] - Spencer, come on. Let's go. Spencer? [tense music] - [Rene] It looks like I may have crossed that line again. Sorry about that. See, if you're clinging to the faint hope that because we're so close, I won't hurt you... [Paul grunts] I won't kill you for the money. But I will kill you for the lies. [Paul grunts] - Wait. Rene, what if I told you the thing you want to hear? Huh? What happens then? - Well... We head back home, get you back working at the club under strict supervision- - Why do you even want me to come back and work with you? You think I stole from you. - Clearly a cry for help. - We're not friends, Rene. We're not anything. I was your employee. I'm not your son. - Now, Paul. [cranking] [Paul yells] Are we friends? - No, no. - [Alberta] He doesn't have your money. - Where's Isaac? - Alberta, run. I mean it, now. - [Aaron] Isaac! Where are you? - I know where your money is. All of it. Just let my friends go and it's yours. - [Aaron] Where are you? Isaac? - He has to say it. The truth. Now. [Paul yelling] - [Alberta] No! Wait! - [Aaron] Isaac. Uh, hey, Rene? Girl? Rene, can I talk to you for a sec? - Aaron, help me, grab her! - Yeah. - I am done messing around, Paul. - Let her go! - Rene, for the love of God, Rene. I didn't take it. What do you want? - Truth! Friendship. Right fucking now or I'll drain her right here. - Rene. There is a naked guy outside. Naked. What do you me to do? - You didn't think we're finished, did you? [tense music] - Hey. That's far enough. No! Get that thing away from me! Aaron! - No way. - Spencer, this isn't role play. He's going to stab you for real. - Everything's fine. This one's a hitter, not a jabber, aren't you? - Did you make the call? - I did. The police are on their way. - Cops, what? No way. - Aaron, she's bluffing. [smacks] - Big, burly men with giant batons. [smacks] - Jesus! - Where the fuck did you get these? - From Isaac. I didn't think he'd need them in jail. - What do you mean jail? Like jail-jail? - He pulled a gun on me in public and the cops swarmed. They took him away right after. - Right after what? Wha-wha? - Right after I figured out that Isaac's the one that ripped off Rene. - Rene? [smacks] Oh boy. - All right, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron. Hi. Hi. - Yeah, what? Uh, what she said... - It's the truth. - Don't. - You didn't think that anybody but Paul was smart enough to pull it off. - Is that true? - She's trying to turn you against me. - Yeah. - Then where's your brother now, huh? Where's your protector? - Aaron! Aaron, look at me! - What? - I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation. - Yeah. Yeah, like what if Paul didn't take the money, huh? - Thank you. - Huh? I mean, what am I supposed to think? I mean, my brother's gone. You're bald. We got a naked freaked walking around. - [Spencer] I am not a freak! [grumbling] [hitting] [grunting] [Aaron breathing heavily] - Isaac did this, didn't he? I know it. You know it. The nurse probably even figured it out. - Isn't it possible that Paul's not to blame? [heavy breathing] - Fuck! Fuck, Rene. Sorry, Paul. How do I, how do I get you out of here? - Move away! I'll decide when or if Paul gets untied! [smacks] [Aaron grunts] Not you! - Aaron, when is this gonna stop, huh? When are you going to fight back? - You shut your mouth! - [Alberta] Paul could have died for his mistake. - Just shut your fucking- [hitting] [grunting] - Stop. Paul's okay. You can still be free. The cops are coming. Aaron, stop. - No, no. Think about yourself. Please stop. [panting] - Hey bro. How you doin'? Can't come to the phone? That's cool. Voicemail all right? Not too fucking good in jail is it? - Aaron, you gotta go. Cops are gonna be here any minute. Look at me. Go. Okay? [panting] [Paul sighs] - Oh. Oh. [soft music] I'm good. - Well. Isaac... Isaac set me up. - It's no wonder your son wants nothing to do with you. Yeah. Can you believe he got sick of being under his dad's thumb? Go figure. - I didn't. I'm sorry. - You're pathetic! [Rene sobs] [soft, tense music] - Never called the cops, did you? - Bluff. It was all Alberta's idea. What can I say? - You can say you have some clothes nearby. Please? [soft music] - I believed you were a thief. I'm sorry. - You're amazing. Do, do you have plans this weekend? - You should see a doctor. - Spence, drive him to the hospital. Your truck's around the corner. Spencer. [soft guitar strumming] Seriously, Friday maybe? Or... Oh come on, I need a yes. All right. [Paul howling] - Okay. - Yeah? - Yes, already. - Okay. - Yes. - You gotta take that thing off before we go to the hospital. Trust me on this. - No way. - So I couldn't help notice you mentioning something about knowing where the money is? Wait it was in his car? You have it, it was in Isaac's car. [sirens blaring] - [Alberta] Crap. I'll make this up to you, I promise. Your house, kitchen table and living room table. - Paintings, business, life plans. Is this you trying to make me feel better? Just let it go, please. You know... You coming back for me, that was really... - Stupid. - Brave. - Well, a promise is a promise. - Stop, okay? We're safe. That's what's... Important. Where did you... - Woo hoo! - I was short on time, but I grabbed what I could. A little help. - [Waiter] Lattes. $7.50, please. - I got this. [laughing] [clattering] [Alberta and Celene scream] [laughing] - Yeah, definitely enjoying you.
