You dare to bump into my Young Master! Antique jade! Mister, please buy a piece of jade. - You sure it's real? - Of course. It's a family inheritance. - How much? - 10 dollars. How can it be worth that? It's worth it Just ten cents. Mister, I can't sell it that cheap. Please give it back to me. It's worth more than ten cents. - Then, you will not even get ten cents. - My jade. - You broke my jade! Pay me back! - Pay? No way. Father... You must pay me. What happened? He's broken my jade but refused to pay me Shithead, piss off! Who's the shithead talking to? The shithead's talking to you! You better pay the man for the jade. Pay? Not before I put you in the ground. It's too bad you feel that way, because I'm in a bad mood. Let me teach you how to pay. Let me help you get up! Wanna kill me? Wow, this is dangerous! My knuckles were barely missed! This money is for you! Get going! I'm doomed, I'm dead! Don't be afraid, it's just the blunt end I will be nice to you. Don't move! Please don't! Haven't got you yet. Now I got you! Fainted that easy? Sometimes my attacks aren't very accurate. Watch out! I chop, chop, chop... the meat! I slice, slice, slice... like a cucumber! I Beat, Beat, Beat... you like garlic! I'm glad I came across you. You sure have brightened my day! It's been ages, brother. You still look great. Your brother is old now. What a beautiful niece I've got. She's still a kid. - Where's Fei-Hung? - He went out. This naughty boy always goes out to play. He's a young man now. I think you may not recognize him now. This time, stay longer. Fei-Hung, don't go away. Come to greet your auntie and cousin. Come here, now. Coming... Shit Greet your auntie. Auntie, cousin. - Cousin. - Fei-Hung. What happened to your neck? I... I slept with my neck in the wrong angle. Let auntie help you. - No thanks, auntie. - Come on, relax Auntie! Mother! Feel better now? Yes Brother, Fei-Hung really looks smart. He's quite tactful and clever. Brother, you're really a good father. Yes, I'm very strict to him. No wonder I heard people praising him as soon as I came here. Really? What did they say? The son of Wong Kei-Ying is very smart. He's also a man of justice. I'm very proud of him. Come here, my son. Come here. Sit down. But there are many sex maniacs in this village. A bad guy harassed your niece on the street just now. He attacked me too Who dares do this to my relatives? Can you recognize him? Sure I can, even if he turns to ashes! I'll teach him a real good lesson. Fei-Hung, come with me. - Why? - That guy is here. Who? He's your son, Wong Fei-Hung. You... Kneel down! Father. This time you have gone too far! Wong Kei-Ying! Another round?! Mr. Li, is someone looking for a cure? I'm looking for your son. Why? Your son beat my son without any reason. He really beat him up. He's wrapped up like a dumpling! Wong Kei-Ying! Give me your son! - You beast, I must kill you. - No, Dad... no... - Brother, you going to kill your own son? - I must kill him. He's a disgrace Mr. Li might think you would be punishing your son too light. Mr. Li didn't come to witness how you punish your son. If he must be punished, I suggest that Mr. Li here is quite capable. What are you doing? Don't move! I'm responsible for what I've done. I will let him hit me back then. Grab it! Not my fault that you are not fighting back. How dare you say something like that Wong Kei-Ying, are you still standing up for your son's act? I will disown him! Do whatever you like with him! Mr. Li, I have a proposition. Let Fei-Hung take 10 strikes without any resistance After 10 strikes, whether he's still alive or dead, we are even. OK? I don't need 10 strikes to kill him, 3 strikes are enough. Young Master, listen, I'm going to avenge you. Be sure you leave him looking just like me now. Master Chiu, that Divine Eight Palm style of yours is really something. Ha! Of course it is! How many strikes is it now?! You want to cut off my posterity? Stop! 10 strikes have been used up now. And someone said he could kill me with 3 strikes. Snake and Crane together. Strike the vital points. I will fight back if you keep going. I told you I would fight back. Making my jacket dirty. Take it! How arrogant, bringing reinforcement, huh?! It's me! You're hitting your own guy! My son, are you alright? Young Master, now I am in the same condition as you. Wong Kei-Ying, you win with your smart tricks. I'll get you one day! Just watch your back! Be careful with him. Come on, let's get out of here. - You watch out! - Come back some other day, He came in with one cripple and left with two. Your fighting style was really good, but I'll still kill you! Brother. It's useless to beat him anymore. Let's punish him by practicing kung-fu. You're really making your father angry. Right from now on you stay in the house. Your punishment will be 3 hours of Horse Stance! Now don't move. Be careful, or the boiling water will burn you. Are you comfortable? Now your lower body is shaking. Your upper body is shaking, and I am shaking from happiness. Pretty boy, let me provide some itchiness. That's enough! Don't push it! I'm just carrying out your father's orders. He says for every bowl you break, you have to stand another incense. Master, you're back. Yes, his stance appears to be pretty steady. - Did he slack off? - No, I've been watching him. Really? Finally some progress. Yes, I'm very tired Are you really tired? But you got a chair. Yes? What? A chair, let me see. Damn it, a chair. You dare cheat me when I'm punishing you. I really can't do anything about you. I'll ask your uncle to come tomorrow and fix you. Who's he? Beggar So. Help me! Hurry. - How pretty, practicing a new style? - You drop dead! I brought you some buns. I'll go get you some water. My neck! Get me down, quickly. You came down so quickly. Hurry up and untie my hands. Hurry up! Eat it! I heard Master asked Beggar So to fix you? - Yes. - Poor you - Why? - You don't know? I heard he's very cruel. All his students have become cripples. Really? It's true. Nui was his student and you know what happened to him? What? He lost all his teeth and hair. His nose was twisted... Even his own father couldn't recognize him. That old fart takes pleasure out of torturing people. What should I do then? You think about it yourself. You've got to help me, I don't know what to do. Escape, that's the only way! Look at you! So clumsy! - Just go. - I'll leave now. RESTAURANT YUE WO - Leaving so soon, my friend? - Dumplings, dumplings! Please take a seat over there. Excuse me, do you mind if I sit here? No sit down.

If I hadn't fallen into the trap. I'd have beaten them. Sounds like an excuse. I forgot to ask why you couldn't pay for your meal. That's a long story. May I know your name? My surname is So.

What's up? Lost your appetite from being beaten up? Master, it's all my fault you were beaten. You're quite right about that indeed. I've seen a lot of things, but till today, I've never been beaten like this. He wasn't better, but you've no strength without your wine. You sure can talk. True, but if I was taught better, I could've beaten that jerk. You mean to say I'm not teaching you right? You're just pushing me around. You're teaching me how to beaten. Your father is without question an excellent master of Hung Kuen style. His methods are among the best. So why would he ask me to teach his son? He wants you to torture me. He asked me because he knows I've got a secret style. What secret style? The 8 Drunken Gods! That's nothing valuable, fighting in a drunken state! That shows your damned ignorance. Many people have asked me to teach them but I turned them all down! Don't be fooled by my staggering, there's power inside to kill, It looks real enough, yet it isn't, the pretense lets you win. Clever, isn't it? So why haven't you taught me it yet? Didn't your father tell you that foundation is very important. I do this because I want you to have a good foundation. I think you're ready. Really? To study Drunken Fist, you'll find it easier if you have a drink first. Drink up. Have another cup. Hung, have you ever been to school? Yes, for a few years. Drink up the wine.
