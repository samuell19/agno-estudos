In the beginning of time, people lived in harmony with magical beings called "brijes." Their relationship was of mutual benefit. The brijes protector is human, and the human in turn took care of his brijes. This relationship was known as the "alliance." When humans reached 13 years of age, They would be instructed by a wise man in the art of synchronicity. Joining the human and his brijes to reach what was known as the "warrior form." This warrior form multiplied the humans qualities and enhanced The magical powers of the brijes in one same being. Warrior forms protected the planet from the Dark and because of them, Many monumental tasks around the planet were created. The most powerful warrior forms from different ancient... civilizations evolved to beocme gods and mythological beings, and were part of the Brijes Council in charge of keeping the alliance. For thousands of years, it was all perfect. Until the day humans stopped believing in magic and dreams, and therefore stopped believing in their brijes. The brijes, forgotten by their humans, were trapped in a parallel dimension. The Dark noticed this separation and offered the brijes to ease... their grief if they agreed to become dark brijes. A war started throughout the planet. The dark brijes and their followers... fought against humans who still believed in their brijes, trying to obtain the secret of synchronicity. Despite every effort from the Brijes Council and its armies, They gradually lost the battle as less and less humans believed in magic and dreams. Mexico 1519: The Conquest One after the other, every continent was defeated. America was the last. Confess, Emperor Cuauhtemoc, if you want your people to stop suffering. Tell us, once and for all, the secret of the brijes synchronicity. Tell them the secret they want and stop all this suffering. Tetlepanquetzal, do you see me taking a nice warm bath? The only thing that matters to me now is that the secret is safe once and for all. Finally, the Brijes Council decided to hide the secret of synchronicity in a codex, the Brijes Codex. The codex had to be hidden until the fulfillment of the prophecy... that announces the coming of the chosen ones, those who will defeat the Dark and restore the alliance. Please hurry up kids. Get off the bus quickly. This is the first time I've been. I hope it's not boring. Pay attention Karla! Karla, Hector, do you know what happens to me when I come to the museum? I think... I think, I'm getting sick. Come on Kimo. It can't be so bad. And besides, knowledge is power. Sure, Atzi. We're going to get a lot of information from these very eloquent rocks. Yeh yeh, right. Come on. I feel bad for Freddy. Today is his birthday, and he has to spend it at the museum. Hey, follow me. Now what, Freddy? This could be the best day of our lives. Oh man, he's going nuts. No, no, listen to me. This museum is full of antiques. There are probably some secret relics protected by the government. You know, like in the movies. If we explore it, we might find the secret. Are you serious? Of course! Yay, yay! Today is your day, Birthday Boy. Fun at the museum. Are you sure this is the way? Relax Excuse me, Officer, if you see some kids playing around here, Don't let them touch anything, and advise me immediately. I told you. Here's where they keep the secret objects that not everyone gets to see. Ahhh... Hey Freddy, I have a message. Where? On your cell? No, it's Wacho, the watch. It's saying it's only seconds till noon, So considering the exact time of your birth, Happy birthday! You're the only person I know who was born exactly at noon. The alignment has occurred. Activation has begun. It's shaking! Be careful! We didn't want to scare you. It's been a sudden activation. Hey, the rock is talking. Excuse me, very nice to meet you. I think the teacher is calling us. There is a story you must listen to. Everyone's future depends on it. You need to know why you are here. Know your story chosen ones. You have a heart longing for recognition, and you value friendship. There is also a young lady with a great mind. Profound thinking and sensitivity beyond words. But despite all that, she is strong as a warrior. And the third one is creative. Deep down inside, he wants to protect those around him. And his only desire is to eliminate pain. And for these reasons, you are the chosen ones. How... how do you know all that? And by the way, who are you people? I am Quetzalcoatl, and they are Ra and Chu-jung. We are the guiding spirits of the chosen ones. Everything we've said is part of the great prophecy reuniting us here today. Just at this moment, far away planets and stars are aligning, And indicating that now is the last chance for Earth to defeat the Dark, And reestablish the alliance once and for all. Is that part of the story you want to tell us? That is correct. Alright. Then we're listening. In the beginning of time, people lived in harmony with magical beings called brijes. Elmer... Elmer... Elmer! What's going on? The cameo has activated. Finally, after years of studying the occult, searching for an ideal pact with the Dark, it has contacted me through my family heritage. A unique piece unlike any other in the world, Garras! Yes, you don't know how much. Yes, we have waited so long for this glorious moment. Here you have it, Garras. The cameo umbra, a passage to the dimension of the Dark. The Brijes Codex has been activated. The prophecy could become true. You must help us to avoid it. The Dark will reward you in turn. I have waited all my life for this moment, the one opportunity to fix this world. Nothing else matters. I will do whatever is needed. The Dark cannot achieve synchronicity. But now that the Dark is stronger than ever, the planets have aligned to allow us to make a complete imitation. What do I have to do? Surrender totally and completely to the Dark, including your dreams and imagination. In exchange for the power, you will need to provoke the change in you and in others. Hmmm... it's a high price. What will happen to my ambitions if I lose the will to see them through? Tell me. The Dark will inspire you and free your mind. And the power, Elmer, think of the power. It will be our chance to beat the codex. As always, you are full of wisdom, Garras. Very well, may the Dark take whatever it wants from me. Elmer, how do you feel? Garras, I feel powerful... And defeat the Dark. That is why we need your help. And what happens if neither one of us accepts? It would be your decision, but it will all be over. The Dark will continue to grow until there is no way back. Earth and all the life on it will be totally submerged in the shadows forever. It would be the end of the world. We can't let that happen. But we don't have any brijes. They are very close in the spiritual world, And we can show them to you if you are willing to dream and believe. Dream. Believe. Yes! Meet your brijes, fearless leader. Hopper, at your service. Wow, nice to meet you. I'm Freddy. Meet your brijes, little one. Hey, how are you? Nice to meet you. I'm Bri, and I want us to be very close. Me too. I'm Atzie. Oops, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. Are you okay? Oh sure, don't worry. I'm okay. And this is, Cloko! Hey Kimo, brother, what's up? Long time no see. How come they know each other? Of course, Cloko was my buddy when I was about five. He used to teach me jokes. Yeh, but how? He is a natural dreamer. One, two, three. Okay, we're ready. Now tell us how we can help you. You have to find the missing pieces of the codex to reestablish the alliance. That's the only opportunity we have to defeat the power of evil forever. Where do we begin looking for those missing pieces that you're talking about? You must begin searching in the past, in the kingdom of an emperor recently crowned. Barely capable of lifting his scepter and whose kingdom is dying. And will you tell us where it is that we have to go? No, I am sorry, all that information will be provided by the codex. Where do I take you, Sir? You just drive. The Dark has three beautiful dark brijes ready to help our plans. But we're still missing the most important thing, the three kids who will intercept the Brijes Codex. We will guide them, along with you, to be the great destroyers of the world. They are near. Pay the toll. I told you this is my territory. Give it to me! What's up guys? I thought you were at the museum. We were waiting for you. Look at what I found over there. The same cry baby as always? It's not my fault that he walks every day on the same side of the street I walk on. I think he likes it. How do you see Zejas, Mutey? That's why I like you, Mutey. You're my number one fan. Let's go then, to the museum. I have an offer you won't be able to refuse. Let's move. I don't like this. Don't go! I have the solution to all your problems, and I can offer you a brilliant future. Don't be afraid. What is this? The entrance to a better world. Meet your match. They are fangs, scales, and claws. You'll be part of something very important. You have been crowned as rulers of a kingdom that you have never imagined. What do you say, your Highnesses? Do you want to claim your inheritance, and have powers that you never imagined? Highnesses? Hi. They talk, huh?! And you also speak, huge scorpion? Brijes scorpion. There is a difference. Well... accept your destinies, Highnesses, kings among men, future of the world. I accept if I can keep the scorpion. As a matter of fact, it is your brijes. What about you? It's my chance to get revenge on the world that left my little sister mute. We accept by all means. Okay, I wonder how this works. Mmmm, there must be a way to activate this rock. How can the clues be hidden inside this thing? Want help? It would help if you had an idea of where we have to go. China! Bless you. What did you say? They had emperors up until a little over a hundred years ago. Why not Japan? That's very easy. It says here that the name, China, means "main kingdom." Therefore the riddle is solved. The place we have to go to is China. So let's begin by studying the Chinese engravings on this codex. They might reveal something. Huh... wow! How come you know so much? It says it here. And beside it, there's a picture of China's last emperor, Chu-jung. It was probably referring to him. Are we right? Absolutely. You know a lot of things. Thank you. Let's see, how do I write, China, here? Like this, Freddy, let me show you. A map. Uhh... China is around, uhh here, maybe here. No, of course, it's here. No, not China. Of course, China is here. Now what? We have to set the date and place we're going to. The date when we're going? Yes, the codex is like a time machine. It will take us to wherever and whenever. Could you give us another clue? Impossible, you're doing great. Keep going. Wait, I think i got it. Like Chu-jung said, when China's last emperor was crowned, he hardly had the strength to lift his scepter. He was two years old. Yes, but the riddle also spoke of a fallen empire. Of course, that is why Puji was China's last emperor. What year do we have to go to? 1908. China, year 1908, home of the last emperor. Well done. When you arrive, seek the emperor, and ask for his tattoo. A tattoo? What does it say? Good luck kids. Watch for the power of the Dark. It knows where the codex has traveled, and it opens a way to that time and place. Hmm... China, early 20th century if I'm not mistaken, let's go. No, Elmer. Wait. What is it? You belong completely to the Dark. If you cross that threshold, it might not let you come back. I have seen it happen many times. Hmmm... I understand. But which one should go then? Wow! That was awesome. Hey, we have to be more discreet. My antennas indicate that we're not very safe here. We have to be very alert at all times. We better go now, right? Why? That guy was giving us a very weird look. Intruders! You are surrounded. Oh, let's run. Quick! Hopper, aren't you supposed to have powers? This is the time to use them. The problem is that until we synchronize with you, any power... that we may have is very limited. But how limited? All right, that wasn't so bad. In the name of the emperor, you three are under arrest. Us three? We're actually six. No, they can't see us. Why not? Because the majority of humans lost their capacity to do so. Only small children, dreamers, and people with nobel hearts can see us at all times without any problem. It's good to have that information. Kneel before his highness, the great Emperor Puji, governor of all China. Oh Emperor, what do we do with these intruders? The emperor is a little bit upset. I'm sorry. Then we'll just execute them. Let it be. What are those little animals? Don't worry. I'm here princess. I will protect you since your brother isn't here. There's nothing to fear. You will see. Incredible. He hadn't stopped crying since he got to the palace. And you, are you able to see our brijes? I don't know what you're talking about, But I can see the happiness of the young emperor, and you brought that here. He might be sad because it must be real hard to have so much power at only two years old. It's not that. The little one was taken from his mother to become emperor. Taken away? By force? I'm sorry I didn't introduce myself. My name is Wen Chao-wang, imperial nanny. I am very grateful to you. Now that you mention it, what do you know about the Emperor's tattoo? Tattoo? But, but the emperor doesn't have any tattoos. Maybe he has one hidden somewhere. What is that thing? It's a monster! No, it's a warrior form, but there is something very strange. You know what, I think he's afraid of the guards. To be honest, I'm a little bit afraid too. I know. I'll tell him we're friends. Okay? Bri, wait! Didn't you say that the guards couldn't see those things? Warrior forms are always visible... because humans and brijes join to become one in that moment. Hi, how are you? I'm Bri. Don't be afraid. The guards won't hurt you. They're friends. Bri! Let's go, Antzie! Hopper, we have to do something. We must synchronize. But there is a process and a ritual. And it requires some training between human and brijes. And you and I hardly know each other. There's no time. It's now or never. Well, at least concentrate. It's the only chance. Oops, I meant to throw him to the other side. Oh well, a miscalculation. Bri, are you okay? How rude. Wow, how strong! I'm a super hero. You're going to wish you stayed home. Oh, wow! It's too easy. Being a hero is more painful than I imagined. Stop it! You better put that column down right now and surrender. Don't. You'll make us very mad. What happened? Oh, my god! That wasn't a good idea at all. What do we do? Oy! Oy! Freddy! I was beat by a girl. What was that? That thing on the roof did it. It's a Shun-yuang mirror. It protects the emperor. I made it myself. Chu-jung, it's good to see you here. We don't know what we're saving the Emperor from, and we haven't found a tattoo. Can you explain it, Chu-jung? Yes. Of course I will. You just saved him. That horrible creature was here to kill the emperor. But that's impossible. I read that the last emperor ruled China for many years. That is true. He grew up thanks to your intervention. We'll think about it later. And the tattoo? Puji was just crowned, so the tattoo has just... A mark on his heel. What is that for? It's a Chinese symbol. That means friendship. Each Chinese emperor has been marked with a different symbol. I didn't want a tattoo until I was 18. What will they say to me at home? My parents won't be very happy when they see me with this. Don't worry. The mark has already disappeared. What do we do now? It's time that you go your way. Don't leave. Puji! Hey, Puji feels alone. Is there something we can do to help him? You already did. Puji, we have to go. Puji, be faithful, and you will see your friends again someday. In the meantime, I will introduce you to a friend for life. Hello. Let's go. Chu-jung, where are you going? To Egypt, but hurry. You're running out of time. You need to go to the year 1345 B.C. Don't stop for anything. We can barely hear you. Ah, we did this too easy. If we press here, here, and here... Freddy wait, your not putting in the correct date. Your gonna... Ahh... Sister, Sister. Are you okay, Mutey? I cannot believe those guys dared to hurt my baby sister. The next step is Egypt. We cannot stop now. You boy, prepare yourself. I promise I'll make him pay. Let's go, fangs. Move. Hmmm, I think I like his style. Yes, I wonder what motivates him. Mutey, he does everything for his sister. She is everything for him. She is his only motivation. A long time ago, she was assaulted by a gang. They say they were a lot of people in the street, and Mutey asked for help, but no one helped her. She has stopped speaking since that day. That's why they accepted the powers you offered. Hmmm... how interesting. They want to take revenge on a world filled with cruel people and cowards. What is your motive, Boy? Well, I also love her, but I like to do whatever I want. Is everyone alright? I think so. So much sand. Where are the pyramids? This can't be. We're too late. Whatever was here no longer exists, and it's all your fault. I programmed the codex with the date Chu-jung said. Chu-jung said 1345 B.C. Oh, if only you weren't so impulsive. Oh, I'm sorry Miss Perfect. You go ahead and program the trip the next time. If there is a next time. Because of you, the world might come to an end. Calm down guys. I'm sure we can do something. Maybe I can program the codex with the correct date, and that will get us there. Let's see. It's simple. What date? If we move this one this way, and let's move this one a little bit here. See, I told you. You did it wrong, Kimo. Take cover, everyone! Are you okay, Kimo? I think so, but what happened? Where's the codex? It disappeared. I can see the pyramids. There is your answer, Atzie. Maybe that's the way we have to go. You be quiet! The pyramids are tombs. I don't think it's a good idea to go there. Remember in China, the codex left us near the Emperor. You're right. The pyramids are too far away. We have to look for some sort of ruin, a cave or something. But with so much sand, it might be hard to find. Would a big pole work? There are no poles here, Kimo. What about that one, over there? That's not a pole. That's an obelisk. It might be what we're searching for. Let's take a look. For sure, the obelisk is some sort of antenna. From a spaceship filled with great secrets and with... That can't be. The Egyptians didn't have spaceships. Look, if we go down that dune, the storm's not as strong. Let's see, let's see. I'll go and find out. Hmmm... I think this might be making a reference to the alliance... and the reason why we are here. It's as if they were telling us a story about the chosen ones restoring the alliance. Look at this, this way. Looks like this is saying something related to us. So now you know how to read Egyptian? The drawings are very clear. Hieroglyphics, ignoramus. Kimo, help me remove the sand, please. Sure. What's this? I have no idea. Let me see. Don't discriminate. I want to see. It wasn't me. No, no! Do it again from the other side. No problem. I think it would be better if Kimo did it. Try this side. Way to go, Kimo! It was me that found it first. Hmm... Let's go, Kimo! You'll pay for everything that you did. Listen Puas... You're anger is altering the Tunnel of Darkness. We have to be really careful. I don't care. I'm tired of the world that always mistreats us. Aren't you afraid of this place? I need some air. Look at all those hieroglyphics, Bri. I'm sure these walls have some sort of clue about what we're doing here, but I can't figure them out. If we were in the right period, there would be someone here to explain them. We don't even have the manuscript. I barely touched it and boom! Well, this place is not so small. I can breathe again. Look at this. It's truly beautiful, but it's falling apart. Tell that to Freddy. We got here late because of him. God, it's so hot. Ooo... "It's so hot." You cry like a girl. Please guys, we're not in kindergarten. I am a girl, you moron. There's another door here. This time, let me do it. Nothings happening, but why? What's wrong, Miss Know-It-All? You couldn't do it? Let me try it. I don't get it. Don't get discouraged. It's just that your faith in me is not strong enough, but that will come with time. A tunnel! Hmmm... but it's too narrow for us. But we fit. Let's go. Who are you? I am Anubis, guardian of the temple. Are you here to help us? By order of the Emperor Tutimekuming, I have been waiting more than 2,000 years for the chosen ones. The scale reacts by leveling itself in the presence of nobel beings. And the character of the chosen ones. But I can see that your hearts are full of conflict. Ahhh... I've got you. Ahhh... Kimo! Kimo! Anubis, help them, please! Yes, save our friends! If you weren't ready, you shouldn't have come. We're not leaving our friends. Antzie, let's go get him, and forget all this. Hmmmm, good. Friends? Always. Kimo... are you okay my friend? They've made it after all. Let's go, Hopper. We have to stop him. Let's find what we came for. What is that? Oh, Kimo! We have to synchronize. Is that you? Stop showing off and help me. Antzie, gotta keep going. Where do you think you're going? Antzie, run! Get ready. Easy, doggy. Quick, take cover! This is what we're looking for. You'll give it to me the easy way? Or the hard way? I won't give you anything. Let's do it the hard way. You will take this rock to Chichen Itza. Are you okay, Atzie? Yeah, but she tried to protect me, and now she's hurt. Watch out! Get out of here quick! I'll try to hold it as long as I can. Thank you, Anubis. Kids, we have to go now. I've been looking for you through time and space. Ra, it's been so long. My friend... I can rest, at last. What an outfit! We're here, friends. At least I'm not barefoot. What is this place? We are in Chichen Itza. If I'm not mistaken, we are on the grounds of a ceremonial ball game. Exactly. It's a pokol-pok field. A pokol what? Pokol-pok, you know, a sacred ball game. Where they present the great battle between good and evil. This is the court with greatest level of difficulty because of the height of the rings. Built special for matches between warrior forms. It's the biggest of them all. By the way, I haven't introduced myself. My name is Zompul Balam. Who are you? We're travelers. We come from a far away place with a very important mission to fulfill. Hmmm... and what is your name, Girl? Hello, my name is Atzie, and they are... I'm Freddy. He's Kimo, Cloko, and eh, where is he? He's up there. Oh yes, and the curious one is Hopper. We're very important beings where we come from. Oh yeah, so you must be coming to the equinox ceremony. Everyone here is waiting with great joy. It is very special for us. As a matter of fact, the chosen one got here just before you did. Tetzin already helped with the ceremony. Twice a year, Kukulkhan comes down from the stars to give us energy from the sun. I should be there, but you know, these things are boring. I prefer something more exciting, like pokel-pok. Wow, I want to meet him. Yes. You already know him, Kimo. He's talking about Quetzalebatl. The Mayans know him by the name of Kukulkhan. Seriously? Is he that famous? What's wrong with your brijes? She's hurt. She tried to protect me from an evil brijes. Meanwhile, that nasty awful kid that was with him took the stone that we were looking for. I don't know what to do for Bri to get better. She seems to be poisoned, and there's no antidote in the vicinity to help. Hmmm.... the only way I can think of to help your friend is synchronizing with her. In the warrior form, it is easy to overcome the effects of the poison. I don't think I can synchronize with Bri. She said I don't have enough faith. Oh, do this time, it is normal for humans, brijes, and warriors to live together. Hmmm... they are way ahead of us. I found him. I found the boy who stole the stone, and he's going to activate it. We have to stop him now. Hmmmm, so you are here to stop the ceremony? Of course not. We just need to get the stone. So maybe you could help us out. I want to become a cricket, Freddy. You have to hurry up. You won't get in the way. I won't let you leave. It's Zompul Balam. I don't understand what's happening. You have the opportunity to get close to the gods. This way you will never be fortunate enough to get close to the chosen one. What do we do now? What do you mean? We have to face him. That's it, or he'll never let us leave. Let's go! Let's fight! Huh! Oh yeah. He's too fast. You need a long time to learn to control your warrior forms. I'm sorry, you'll have to stay here forever. Listen, could you take this? What? What's that? What was that? An illusion? What did you do? I just believed that I could recall the beast from Egypt, It was the first thing that came to mind. Are you okay? Yes, don't worry. Stay here, and synchronize yourself with Bri. Leave it to us. We'll go get the stone. Good luck, my friends. Oh no! I truly hope you can make it in time. Atzie! Bri, hang in there! Don't worry. I will go to find out what's going on. They are intruders. Don't pay attention to what's going on. The ceremony will go on. Atzie! Atzie! Oh no, I'm lost. These kids gave us a lot of trouble. Don't worry. I have everything under control. Atzie, no! There's Bri! I'm going to fail you, Bri. Your heart is beating faster than mine, and I don't know how to change it. Imagine how our warrior form would be. I, Kukulkhan, am making myself present to give her the energy of the sun. Come to me, and give me your power. What's going on, Tzeltzin? What have we done? This must be the work of the Dark. In that case, there is nothing else we can do. They key has finally been charged. The Kingdom of Darkness is getting closer and closer. This can't be happening. The ceremony was supposed to be the opportunity for the alliance to be restored. Kukulkhan Scepter, show me the piece that compliments the code where it needs to be used. I see. So that pillar is the piece? Good. Hmm, haven't we seen that pillar somewhere? Wasn't it at the museum? With the union of the pieces... and the energy of the feathery serpents, no one will stop me. Never. What? Atzie! You did it. I've got it. You have nothing. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, and please take care of Zombpul Balam. Give it back. LISTEN, WE'RE IN THE TUNNEL, WE GOT RID OF THAT KID. It's not over yet. Be alert. The codex is not okay. It looks like it was affected by the Dark. It's true, the codex is not okay. Look at the energy. It looks like the one in Egypt. Yes, that energy appeared when you tried to program the code. It's true. It was very funny. Huh! Bri, I'm so glad you're here. Don't worry, we have what we came for. We're back to the original plan. Now we only have to activate the codex and restore the alliance. Children, give back what is mine. I thought you were better. Where is the stone? I was unconscious. I don't know. It can't be. Hang in there. Give it back. Give it back. Give it back. I finally got it. Now look, Elmer. What is going on? Where did they go? What is that? It's beautiful. It's the alliance, Freddy. The connection between the spiritual and the earthly worlds. This cannot be happening. Elmer, you know there's only one way to get them and stop them. The portal will take us to the kids. You said it was dangerous for me. I have given everything. The price is high, it's true, but there's no other way to stop them. We have to take a chance. You're right. Let's do it. You're right. Let's do it. Look, who's that? Where are they? Where? The alliance has been restored. The true identity of the chosen ones has been revealed. A young man willing to risk all and a heart longing for recognition. A young lady with an open mind, profound thoughts and a sensitivity beyond words. And a creative youngster who's only wish is to protect the ones he loves and to get rid of pain. You have followed a difficult path. And from being helpless, you crossed over to fulfill your destiny. No, the chosen ones were supposed to be corrupted. There will be no more interruptions in the great plan of the Dark. Now you'll truly learn what real power is. This is very bad. Oh, we cannot be afraid of them. Chosen ones or not, we have to stop him. Synchronicity! Imagine. Kimo. And these are the ones that are trying to stop me! Listen, it's not possible that we haven't learned anything. We have to work together to make it happen, the three of us. Look, it's Puji. Ready, Atzie? Ready, Kimo? Ready! Do you think he is... ? I don't know, Atzie. There's something very wrong here. Get away from Elmer. What has he done? He has turned completely to the Dark. Don't be afraid. We can stop him. We have to stop him. I will destroy you, no matter what. Uh, this is not what we wanted. No, you will not betray me! Ahhh... Mutey. Oh, no! But you were the real chosen ones. Of course you are, and sometimes the price is too high. This is not a game, dumb kids. Prepare to know the true power of darkness. Where am I? Freddy... Freddy... Freddy... where are we? What... what happened, Freddy? Atzie, I'm so glad you're here. What's going on here? Listen to me. This is an illusion. We have to get out of here. I can't hold them much longer. Don't move. If you're not afraid, they will not be able to hurt us. Hold on. Don't be afraid. This time, I can see through your illusion. This time, I can surpass you illusion. Can you see it now? Elmer fooled us. This is not what we wanted. That is true my friend. You and I are going to fulfill our destiny. Good luck children. You fooled us! You'll be defeated! Wait, it's not him. Elmer is too powerful. Everyone listen! You have to have faith to be able to help us. Atzie, now! Everybody, do like me. Raise your hands to Elmer. Hey Mom, do you think that girl is going to be okay? How could this happen? They were the chosen ones. The price to save the world can be very high for the chosen ones. Well, Boy, know that the world will be in her debt forever. She will soon be a legend. I don't care about that. I only want her to be here with me. Brother, I'm okay. She's okay, look. She's fine. She's alive. Oh, thank you. Balance has been established, the beginning of a new era. Yay! Hey, you're here! Forgive me, this is yours. Hey where's my yo-yo. And the brijes? Now that will depend on each one of you. If you have faith, you will also discover your brijes.
