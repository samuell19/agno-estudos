(engines roaring) (people cheering) (solemn music) - [Pier] James Dean came out of the Midwest to take Hollywood by storm. Our first meeting (rock music) was at the studio. It was a simple, silly moment that changed both our lives. I am Pier Angeli. (motorcycle rumbling) - What the! (tires screeching) - Oh my gosh! - (groaning) Oh. - Are you all right? - Uh, you knocked me off my feet. - Me? I did not touch you. - Your beauty did. (mellow swing music) Lovely and beautiful. No. I need your help. Have a cup of coffee with me. - I'm on my way to the commissary if you'd care to come along. - I'd like that. - So, are you usually so bold? Inviting women to coffee that you don't even know? - Well, are you always this beautiful? - [Pier] (chuckles) Oh. Mama warned me about Hollywood men like you. - Whoa, hold on there. I'm not from Hollywood. I'm just like you. A stranger in a strange town. And you're working on? - I'm working on "The Silver Chalice" with Paul Newman. And you are working on "East of Eden." You know, I've heard people say that James Dean is going to be the next Marlon Brando. - Yeah, well, people say a lot of things. - Oh, I have to get back to the set. ("You Are the One") - Me, too. - Okay. Bye. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I, uh, I wanna see you again. And maybe we could go for a ride or have a picnic or something.

Stop worrying about television. It's a passing fad, like 3D. - Hi. - Hey, Kazan. Welcome back to paradise. - Nice, Jack, thanks. - Gadge. - Bill. Jack, this is James Dean. - Hello, Dean. - Hello. - New discovery, huh? He's no Bogart. Hope he can act. - He sure can, Jack. Just won a Tony on Broadway. - I've been reading about you. You're very good. - That's Bill Roman, my right-hand man. Well, one of them anyways. Grab a seat. Okay, now we're here to create some good entertainment. So remember, Mr. New York Boy Actor, we wanna make great pictures. Academy Award pictures. Now, you're in Kazan's hands so you listen to him. Can't go wrong. What's next? - Well, Jack, everything's in place. We just need a couple script rewrites and, uh, your blessing. - You got it. Okay, let's start the shoot right away. - Yes, Mr. Warner. - I want this picture out as soon as possible. And, Bill, you give Gadge whatever he wants. Whatever. - Yes, sir. - Don't go over budget. - [James] Mr. Warner. - You ride a motorcycle. - Hey. Are you the little bastard on the motorcycle almost killed Bill? Now, you listen to me. This is a movie studio, not a speedway. You understand? - Next time, I'll be more careful. - Okay. - I'll try and aim to please. (Bill scoffs) - I got a smart-ass. (nostalgic music) - When I was young, real young, my ma and I had this game. (birds singing) A wishing game. What you did was you wished for something. - What kind of wishes? - Oh, any kind. You know, like, if you wanna get a bike fixed or apple pie for supper, (chuckles) you know, just wishes, kid wishes. And what you did was you wrote them down and you put them under your pillow at night, and sometimes, but not always, the wishes would come true. Ma, she'd help me write them down, (chuckling) so she always knew. Ma and me, we were real close. She taught me things and read me stories and we had this little theater made up of an old cardboard box with dolls which we dressed up and had play, pretend plays. Dad didn't hold with that. Ma, she'd just smile and tell him not to be so simple. She was developing my (chuckling) sensitive side. (Pier chuckles) One day, my ma, she went to the hospital. I was only nine. And my dad, he said, "Jimmy, your mother is not coming home." And they put my, uh, they put my ma in this coffin in a cardboard box. And I thought it was like our, uh, our play-pretend theater, except this weren't no play-pretend. She was, uh, she was really dead. She had, uh, long, dark hair. So soft, so fine. She was beautiful, like you. (sighs) Then I went to live with my Aunt Ortense and Uncle Marcus on their farm in Indiana. At the funeral, I cut off a lock of her hair and I took that hair and I put it under my pillow every night. For a long time. Wishing she'd come back home. But you know wishes. They don't always come true. But you gotta play the wishing game. - Oh, baby. - Ma used to call me baby. That's what she called me. I miss her. - What about your father? - Ah, he lives in Santa Monica someplace. - Do you talk to him much? - Not too often. He thinks I'm (chuckling) wasting my time being an actor. - I lost my father sometime ago. My mama, she raised us. She's been mother and father and friend. Mothers are very important. - Let's go get that pizza. - [Pier] What time do you have to be back at the studio? - [James] Later. We have plenty of time for pizza, then I'll drop you off. We'll make time on the bike. - Okay, but don't go fast. You know I don't like it when you go fast. (laughs) You can go a little bit faster. - Whoo-ee! First time a woman ever said that to me. (engine rumbling) - Now, look, Jimmy. You're a very talented young man, okay? But I just can't stand this imitating and acting like Brando. This Brando bullshit has gotta stop, all right? If I wanted Brando, I would've hired him. Now, I know Marlon has been an influence on you for some time. But it just doesn't work, Jimmy. Not for this part. - Don't you think I'm aware of it? - Okay, all right. Just remember, you got enough talent of your own. I want you. The actor. I want the James Dean that I saw onstage. - Okay. Okay. Tell me, tell me about the shot again. - Okay, all right. Now, look. Now, in this scene, it's gonna be completely black, totally dark, all right? Now, the moonbeam shines and then slowly, very slowly, you appear in that window. And no smiling face, okay? - Okay. - All right, get up there. Places, everyone. Let's go. Ready up there, Jimmy? - [James] You got it! - All right, lights out. (reel whirring) Good, good. - Rolling! Speed. - [Elia] Now, bring me the moon. And action. (crew laughing) Cut, cut!

(sobs) - Love is not enough. - Yes, it is. Love is everything. Love is everything. - I'll miss you, Jimmy. I will miss you so much. And I will think about you. Probably too often. (organist playing "I Love You My Darling") (bell tolling) (people clapping) (camera shutter clicks) (engine rumbling) ("Rebel Rider") (car horn honking) (solemn music) - [Announcer] He's looking at his rear-view mirror. Everybody and his brother is fighting to take that fourth spot away from him. ("Race with Destiny") Dean moves to the outside. (speaks faintly) Takes third. He passes Jeffries and moves into the third spot. He's on the charge with a half lap to go. He looks like he'd like to go for a second on the outside, a dangerous move. ♪ I won't quit this thing till I'm through ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm on a race ♪ - No, he passes Galligan, back in second. And if you look behind you, here he comes, Jeffries, to take third back. I hope they all remember the start/finish is still wet. This could get very exciting. Out of the final corner for the last time for the checkered flag. Ross is in the lead, (speaks faintly) is second. Dean battling for fourth. ♪ And I won't quit this thing ♪ (engines roaring) ♪ Till I'm through ♪ - Dean inches ahead as the checkered falls across. Galligan, Jeffries, and Dean, unbelievable. It's the first race ever and he captures fourth. ♪ And baby, you know I won't quit this thing ♪ - Hey, wait a minute. ♪ Till I'm through ♪ - [Announcer] Dean, he's headed for the exit! He is either unhappy with fourth or doesn't wanna sign autographs. (solemn music) - [Pier] I am Pier Angeli. - [James Voiceover] Oh, I like that. It's like pure angel. - [Pier] Actually, it's Anna Maria Pierangeli. But I thought for acting that the screen name's better. Pier Angeli. (mellow jazz music) - [Mario] Can I help you? - Table, please? - I'm sorry, we are fully booked. Sorry. - Mario. - Step on the side. Mr. Warner, good evening, how are you? - Mario, you're looking good. - Please. Thank you very much. - Looking good. How's the family? - Very good, thank you. - Good. - Your table will be ready in a few seconds. - Thank you, Mario. Nick, how are you? - (chuckling) Hey. How are you? - Good to see you. You're looking good. Hey, I hear your last picture's doing very good, huh? - Almost as good as yours. - Don't you forget it. (Nick chuckling) - Can I get you a drink? - [Jack] Yeah, what is that? - Chardonnay, dry. - Ah, good. Hey, Dom, I'll have the same. Okay, now tell me about the picture. - It's called "Rebel Without a Cause." It's about the restless kids out there today. Not the hardcore delinquents, but kids from good families, caught up in a need to be somebody. - Yeah, I like that. Juvenile delinquents, switchblade knives, lots of T and A. Something quick and dirty for the kids, huh? Sell some tickets, lots of popcorn. Hey, fade to black. Good. - Uh, well, Jack, I see it as a little bit more than that. - Such as? - It's a movie about real teenage rebels. I'd like the actors to meet and work with real rebels. You know, greasy hair, tight Levi's, cigarettes in rolled-up packs. All of that would make a movie very realistic. - Ah, realism, I like that. Whatever you want. Whatever you want, Nick. As long as you don't go over budget and cost too much money, you got it. - Uh, there is one other thing, Jack. I'd like to do a little special prep on this one. - Like what? - Like get the actors together with the hoods so that we can take lessons in hooding. - Hooding. I like that, lesson in hooding, huh? Listen, you get that little bastard Dean to be himself. He's already a hooligan. Hey, Sam, Francis. - [Man] Hello, Mr. Warner. - Salud. - Good luck, Nick. ("Too Cool for School") - Uh, listen, Jimmy. We got a big cast party this coming Saturday. You wanna be my date? - Sorry, Natalie, I can't make it. I have a more important commitment. - Oh, what's that? - I'm gonna be racing my car in Palm Springs. - Oh, really. - Okay, listen up, guys. You too, Natalie. Pick up scripts if you don't have any. Today, you're going to be in a special school. Special training in how to be super cool. On how gangs act, how their members act. A class in how to be a hood. Your instructors. Well, your teachers, real honest-to-goodness, or -badness, hoods. (chuckles) That's right. I have a real gang here. A real gang from Hollywood Boulevard. - I really liked your work in "East of Eden." You're great. - Thanks. It was a good part. - Do you wanna do something tonight? - What? - I just thought you and me might do something. Something special. Dinner and who cares what? - Uh, Sal. We can be friends. Just friends. Concentrate on your work. It's more important. - Introducing the Hollywood Honchos. This is Easy Dan. Leader, head honcho. Easy Dan, let me introduce you to the cast of "Rebel." James Dean. Natalie Wood. Sal Mineo. Dennis Hopper. Nick Adams. You guys have any questions, ask them now. - So, you Honchos ever been in a fight? - Oh yeah. We rumble plenty. Tub! Show him. - [Natalie] Ew. - Tubby here stopped a blade with his belly. - Whew, that shows a lot of guts. (cast laughing) - Okay, Tub. Yeah, a lot of us got some battle scars. - Well, Easy Dan, what's it take to be a good hood? - To be cool, no matter what, you don't lose the cool. Right, Honchos? - Yeah. - Right. - [Man] Yeah. (James clapping slowly) - Good advice. (tense music) Say, Easy Dan. Mind if I ask you a few questions out here? I guess what I don't understand is group dynamics. - What? - Well, why the leader, you, how you relate to all the other gang members. - That's easy. I'm the boss! They do what I tell them. They do whatever I tell them. They'd kill for me. - Whew. That's a lot of loyalty there, Dan. Easy Dan. Why? Why you and not, say, Tubby with the scratch across his gut? - 'Cause I'm the best. What? I'm the toughest, I'm the smartest. That's why they do what I say. - What if you told them to do something, something wrong? - They'd still do it. - Why? - Because I'm the leader. (Dan grunting) - What if I gouged out your eye? Think I'm fucking crazy enough to do that? - Just take it easy. Just take it easy, all right? Just take it easy. - Be cool? - Yeah. (stammering) Just be cool. - Easy Dan, I don't think you're much without your gang. I think your balls shrivel up inside your gut when you don't have anybody else around. Ain't that right? - Yeah, yeah, I guess so. I don't know. - Yeah, you're chicken like everyone else without a gang. Ain't that right? Tell me you're chickenshit yellow. Tell me you're chickenshit yellow inside. Come on! - Ah! Okay, I'm chickenshit, all right? - Okay, that's what I thought. I just wanted to know. You go on in there and you be the, you be the big guy. Be big head honcho. Tough guy, huh? - Man, you're fucking crazy. ("Race with Destiny") - [Announcer] It's a good day for racing. Overcast skies, cool temperatures. Those engines will be singing. (engine roaring) James Dean is in the fight of his life here as he works his way to the front. In his first race at Bakersfield, he captured fourth. Not too bad. If the studio fires him, he can have a new career. We've watched Dean's (engines drown out announcer) numerous times. Never have I seen him race harder. Throwing caution to the wind. No holds barred. Clawing, scratching, shuffling, dicing, driving to the limit. James Dean, is he a flash in the pan or is he a race driver? This is only Dean's second race. The way he's carving a path through the back, I'd say he's a racer inside, outside, in between. Definitely no lack of courage. Making good judgments as he maneuvers to the front of the pack. Final lap, Dean's in third, looking ahead. He sees the lead chain. Fourth, last time out. Third, this time. No, wait. Wait a minute. He's going to challenge for second. Can he make it stick? Could he win? (spectators cheering) We'll know in less than a half mile as they come down the straightaway. Here they come. Down to the line. Dean is second. (spectators cheering) (woman in blue giggles) - Yoo-hoo, Jimmy. We have a meeting in one hour with Jack Warner and Bill Roman. Why aren't you ready? Come on out now. Dry yourself behind the ears. Let's go take care of business. - Aw, Jane. You worry too much. Besides, all work and no play makes Jimmy a dull boy. - (chuckles) No, honey. All work and no play makes jack, period. Come here to mama. Ooh. All right, now we're gonna go take this meeting, and then I have a little surprise for you. - Oh, goody. I love a nice surprise. - Better than that, kiddo. If you behave yourself, I'm going to introduce you to a new young actress from Europe. Ursula. She's very beautiful. And very exotic. No, no. - Come on, Jane. Come on. - Jimmy. - Oh, come on, come on. - No, honey. - Come on, come on. - I know all of your tricks. Stop it. All right, come on, get yourself together, all right? I'll go ahead and you meet me in front of the administration building. But you know, you hurry up. (chuckles) - That's good, that's good, Juan. Hey, Bill, now how you coming along with Johnny? - Oh, so far so good, sir. George Stevens is right on schedule and right on budget. And the dailies with Elizabeth Taylor and Rock? Smashing. We still have a lot of work ahead, though. I mean, here and also on location in Texas. - Texas, huh? Ah, good, good that you use real cowboys wherever (groans) you can. I want realism. - Yes, sir. - Bill, for chrissakes, we're family. Will you stop with the yes sir? - Yes. (chuckles) Jack, you got a heart of gold. - Yeah, yeah, teeth to match. - Hey, Jane. - How you doing? - Bill. - Come on in. - Hello. - Nice to see you. - Mr. Warner? - Ah, Jane, it's good to see you again. Dean, I'm glad you brought your pretty agent with you. There's something I want she should know, too. Now, you, Mr. Dean, you're a royal pain in the ass. Now, in spite of all the problems, we've put up with you because you're talented and you got legs. - What Mr. Warner means by that is that people will stand in line to see you on... - I know what I mean. I saw that news reel about your winning that race in Palm Springs. Very nice. Good, good winning. What if you got killed, huh? What if you got into a crash and broke both arms and legs and ended up in a hospital for a couple of months? You know what that would do to my schedule? It could kill the picture. Slay the giant. Now, I'm a fair man. Am I a fair man? - Yes, sir. No doubt about it, Mr. Warner's a fair man. - Oh, no doubt about it. - With a heart of gold. - Oh, a heart of gold! - The point is, slow down, James Dean. No more race cars, no more motorcycles, no more fast women. Oh, fast broads okay, I guess. - Now, you listen to me. - [Jane] Now, wait, now, now. Just cool down now. - Now, you listen to me, Mr. Dean. And you listen good. From now on, no race cars while you're shooting this picture. After they get your last shot, I don't give a damn what you do. But for now, you take no more chances. I got enough problems shooting movies as it is. Understood? Understood? Now, go to work. - Well, he made himself perfectly clear, didn't he? - Oh yeah, that son of a bitch made himself perfectly clear. But it doesn't matter to me. Preach all he wants but he can't control me. - No racing, Jimmy. Huh? Okay? - Yeah. No racing, yeah. - All right. I just got a note from my New York office. Hedda Hopper has just given you an excellent review for your work in "East of Eden." In the Times magazine. - That lady, the lady with the hat that looks like a whorehouse chamberpot? - (giggles) Yeah, the hat lady. All right, I'm gonna make this short meeting with Zanuck as long as I can, okay? I'll be back. - Yeah. - Okay? - [James] Jack. - What now? - Now, you listen up and you listen good. You're the boss around here and it's your studio. But I'm my own man. Nobody, not you, not nobody tells me what the hell to do. And I'll sure as hell do my part, but I won't take any shit off of you or anybody else. Next time you got a message for me, make a request and talk to me alone. Otherwise, you're gonna be one sorry son of a bitch! - What the hell was that? (Pier speaking faintly) ("Angeli") Pier. - Jimmy. - I heard your voice. I wanted to see your face. - Jimmy. I hope everything is all right with you. - Everything's fine. How about you? - I'm okay, too. - You happy? - I don't ask myself that question. How about you? - Happiness isn't everything in life anymore. I got my work and I got racing. Keeps me going. - I still think about you. I'm glad I saw you, Jimmy. - Yeah. Me, too. - Goodbye, Jimmy. Be careful. (soft guitar music) - You wanted to see me? - Where the hell have you been, Dean? - What? George, you didn't seem to be needing me so I stepped out for a while to get into character. - You're a professional. You get into character and stay in it until you're needed. I want you here at all times, not just for your scenes. - It's 120 degrees outside. - Aren't you man enough to take it? The rest seem to be handling it. - It's not all that. You shoot every scene 20 ways till Sunday. - Are you directing this picture? This is not just one man's story as told by James Dean. This is a sprawling epic of Texas and its people. You're just part of the picture. - Yeah, but... - No buts. Now, do your job or get the hell out of my picture. (telephone rings) Yeah? Yeah, I'll be right there. (soft guitar music) - Hey, Dennis. My shadow, how's it going? - On the rocks, Jimmy. I just wondered, down there on location, when you took a piss in front of everybody, (chuckles) why'd you do that? - (chuckles) Well, why'd you think? Think I was trying to show off the size of my unit? Oh, I was just nervous, you know? First scene with Liz and all. Everybody could see it wasn't working. Even that son of a bitch Stevens, he could see it wasn't working. So, I figured, you know, if I can just haul it out in front of everybody and take a piss and be cool about it, well then I can do anything. Liz or no Liz. (chuckles) And it worked. Ah. Let's roll it. (film reel rattling) - [Gig] How fast does your car go? - Oh, an honest miles an hour, it goes 106, 107. - You've won a few races, haven't you? - Oh, one or two. - Where? - Well, I, I showed pretty good at Palm Springs and ran at Bakersfield. You know, people say racing is dangerous but I'd rather take my chances on the track any day than on a highway. Well, Gig, think I'd better be taking off. - (chuckles) Now, wait a minute, Jimmy. One more question. Do you have any special advice for the young people who drive? - Take it easy driving. The life you might save might be mine. (projector switch clicks) - [Dennis] When's it set to air? - Um, September 30th. - Well, it looks good. - Uh, okay, I guess. ("I Love You My Darling") Don't think it's gonna save any lives, though. People see it, someone will still drive like assholes.

(reel whirring) - That's it? One take. - Well, sometimes, that's all it takes. - Well, what do you think, George? Did I do all right for you? Are you pleased, are you happy? - Shall I tell you something, James Dean? Shall I tell you something that no man ought to have to tell another? - Go ahead, I'm all ears. - You've got problems, Dean. Serious problems. Like Jack said, you're a little bastard. - Now, wait... - Goddamn it. Just listen to me and don't interrupt. Sometimes, you're brilliant. You could be the best, but I'm betting against it. Because inside the man is a little sniveling boy. A crybaby kid who's afraid to grow up and be a man and join the team. Can you straighten yourself out? Can you work with people? - Hell, I did everything you asked. Even when I knew you were totally bullshit wrong. - I am the director. I see the forest. You are just an actor, another tree in the forest. - Movies are about acting. That's what the audience sees. - Acting is only part of it. There are the words, the story, the spectacle. They've all got to come together. Oh hell, you acted, yeah, but the... - But what, Mr. Truth-Seeker? Oh, oh, what about you? You old king, sitting on his folding chair throne, huh? What about your own insecurities? Let's take it again. Let's do that scene over again, okay? Take 10, 12, 20. You shoot every scene over and over, 20 times till Sunday. And then, when I get a scene down, I can feel it when it works. But not you. You never know. - My way has worked pretty well in the past. - And what about making me sit there and sit there and wait and wait? I was all ready to shoot and you never got to me. - You are not a god. You're just a person. Talented, yes, but there are lots of talented people. You are paid to wait and work just like everyone else. In my movies, everyone is important, not just the stars. - I know that, George. I mean, you do good. You're a genius. That's why I work for you. That's why I wanted to work with you. - Well, Jimmy, it's over now. What's done is done. You gave a hell of a performance. You might even get an Academy Award nomination for it. But you are one son of a bitch to work with. - Same goes for you, George. We're both just two damn sons of bitches. You old son of a bitch. - You young son of a bitch. - Well, I guess I'm through here, huh? - Yeah, I guess so. We got all your scenes. You're free. - Thanks again. - Hey, sonny boy. (birds chirping) - So? How'd it go? - Eh. Piece of cake. You just got $100,000 a picture. You are one of the highest paid actors in show business, Mr. James Dean. - Ah, about time. - Oh, well, thanks a lot, Jane. Why, sure, Jimmy. - [James] Aw. - All right. Now, this is the reason why I asked you to meet me here today, okay? MGM loaned Liz Taylor out to Warner's to do "Giant" with you and Rock. Now, they want the favor returned. They have contracted you to do the life story of the boxer, Rocky Graziano. - Yeah, in "Somebody Up There Likes Me." - [Jane] He sure must. - Yeah, but first I'm gonna go racing. You know, take off for a while. - Well, no. Even before that, okay? We have one little small problem. - What? - Do you think that you could act with Pier Angeli? I know all that she's put you through and I know how you felt about her, but the studio, they want her. They want her to play Mrs. Graziano opposite your Rocky. - (stammering) I don't know. It'd bring up a lot of stuff. She may not even wanna do it either. You know, it'd be hard. Real hard. Maybe better if somebody else does it. I don't know, I mean, Paul Newman, somebody. Vic Damone. - Well, they want you, period. Now, the point is, do you want Pier to work with you or not? And we need to know today. Those papers are upstairs ready to be signed. - Aw, Jane, I'd have to talk to her and she might not even wanna talk to me. - Well, why don't you go talk to her, okay? She's waiting. - Where? - She's in that little screen room around to the left. You know it. Now, this is if you wanna talk to her. If you don't wanna do this, Jimmy, she'll understand. It's a very big part for her. Hmm? - Hello. - Hello. - You're looking well. A little tired, maybe. I heard shooting "Giant" was very difficult. - Yeah. Aged me about 100 years. How's the baby? - (chuckles) Perry. His name is Perry. He is the most beautiful little boy. - Well, I wish you all the luck in the world with Perry in your lives. - Thank you, Jimmy. - So. What are we gonna do? - About this picture? - "Somebody Up There Likes Me." You wanna be my wife? Play pretend? - I have always wanted to be your wife. Until the day I die, I will want to be your wife. I would have no trouble showing the understanding. And the love. And the passion. - That Mrs. Graziano showed for Rocky. - Of course. - Why, I guess I could show what a guy would fight and die for. I guess I could act like that. I guess I could act like we were in love and imagine what it would be like to be married. - Jimmy, you're not being fair. - No. But it's not fair, is it? It's not fair at all. - Jimmy. We have to move on with our lives. And you will find someone special to share your life with. You have so much to offer. You have so much love and kindness. And so much talent. - Yeah. But when I showed all that emotion and all that feeling, where did it lead me? - Jimmy. Jimmy. I am so sorry that I hurt you. But I had no control. I know that this was difficult for you to see me. Because it was difficult for me, too. (Pier sighs) This is a good part for me, Jimmy. But if you don't want me to do it, I understand. - (sighs) I want you to do it. I wanna be with you. But it's not gonna be easy for me. - It's not going to be easy for me either. Thank you, Jimmy. (melancholy music) (knocking on hood) - Hey, Rolf, hurry up. Race is gonna start without us. - Get in the car. Start it. - Get in the car. Get in the car. (engine rumbles) - Purr like a pussycat. (engine roaring) - Purrs like a wildcat, screams like a bitch. Not a pussy, Rolf. Not a pussy. - (whistles) Wow. Hello, son. - Hey. Hey, Dad. Uncle Charlie. - Awful pretty machine. - You wanna take this machine for a ride around the block? - No, no, no, no. You take your Uncle Charlie here for a ride around the block. (hinges creak) - Come on, Dad. One quick spin around the block. (Winton chuckles) - All right. - Jim? I'll go change my clothes, then we'll go. - (grunts) Oh, doors, huh? (chuckling) Okay. Need a shoehorn to get in here. (siren wailing) How come only one seatbelt? (seatbelt clicks) - Only one driver in the race, Dad. Only one driver. (engine rumbling) ("Angeli") - [Pier] It must've been fate or something. It was Friday, September 30th, 1955. Vic and I were driving to see some friends but Vic got lost. There he was. Jimmy, laughing. It wasn't the happy laughter he used to share with me. I know deep inside, he was hurting. Because I was hurting. I was ready to jump out of the car. But then he drove away. And that was the last time I ever saw him. I'll never forget the love that I had with him. (engine roaring) (tires screech) - So, Dad. You sure you don't wanna come to the races with me? - (chuckling) No. Nope. Huh. I never understood what you were trying to prove with this racing. - Yeah, you never did understand me much. Not from the start. - No, I guess not. But I always loved you. As I could, in my way. (solemn music) Well, guess we better go, too. - Yeah. See you, Dad, Uncle Charlie. - Be careful, son. - I'll try. - Come on. (engine purring) Getting tired? - No, feeling good. Free! - Good. ("Angeli") (James shouts) - Woohoo! Got you. - Why? Why do you like this bullfighting so much? (laughing) ("Race with Destiny") - Hey, Rolf. Rolf, wake up! ♪ On a race ♪ - Give me a cig. ♪ On a race with destiny ♪ - Here. ♪ At a pace that even scares me too ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm on a race ♪ ♪ On a race with destiny ♪ ♪ I won't quit this thing ♪ - Let's give it a try. ♪ Till I'm through ♪ ♪ My daddy said to me when I was a small boy ♪ ♪ Son, you're crazy ♪ ♪ But I did not agree ♪ ♪ This car that I drive ♪ ♪ It ain't no child's toy ♪ (siren wailing) ♪ I'll beat them, Daddy ♪ ♪ Just you wait and see ♪ ♪ I'm on a race ♪ ♪ On a race ♪ ♪ On a race ♪ (James sighs) - You drive way too fast, Mister. What is this thing anyhow? - Porsche Spyder 550. New, just bought it. - Probably doesn't even belong on the road. Aren't you James Dean, the actor? Just did a film for the Highway Patrol about speeding? - Yup, that's me. - Now, here you are. Your autograph, please. (James chuckles) (pen scratching) You be careful driving, now. - Yeah, yeah. The life I save might be mine. (engine purring) (solemn music) (engine roaring) ("Amazing Grace") (solemn music) (engine roaring) (tires screech) Son of a bitch is braking! We're gonna die!
