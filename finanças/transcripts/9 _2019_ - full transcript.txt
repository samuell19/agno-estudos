It's too dark, Dad. Nothing is visible. Open your eyes. Alby, we should see only through this. No, Dad. This is really frightening. Why do you feel so? Trust your dad. But Ms. Mercy told me not to go out today. I know that you will obey her as she is your favourite. But who teaches you science? - You. Isn't it? Then, you must obey me when it comes to matters like this. Okay, Dad. Dad, what if the moon doesn't move? It will be dark, isn't it? Such a dumb question, isn't it, Dad? There are no dumb questions when it comes to science. Science got its answers to several complicated questions because of such dumb questions. You should never stop asking questions. You shouldn't stop until you get an answer. Do you get it? - Yes. Do you know how big this universe is and how tiny human beings are, compared to it? What's the name of the galaxy of which Earth is a part of? Milky way. - Correct. Earth is just a small planet in the milky way. It is said that there are more than twenty thousand crore such galaxies in this universe. Huh! Do human beings inhabit all of them? Albert Einstein had said this once that for human beings, the universe is just like a big library is for a toddler. Huge book shelves full of tomes written in strange languages beyond his understanding. The toddler doesn't know how to read them. So, he can't find out the mystery behind all that. Dad, when I grow up I'll become a great scientist. We need not become a scientist to know more about the things around us. As I said, you must keep asking questions. After some time, people around us will say that not all questions have an answer. That's a lie. Look up at the sky, Albert. You'll get answers to all your questions from there. 'Saint Antony's UP School, Plassanal.' Ms. Mercy. Ma'am, can you please seal this and post it? I am not quite sure about the address. Please send it to ISRC. Ma'am, please don't forget. 'Scientists have announced that a super comet' 'capable of causing massive destruction' 'is nearing the surface of Earth.' 'Only few days are left' 'and everyone around the world are bustling with anxiety.' 'In several countries, the panic-stricken masses' 'have started organised riots.' 'There is chaos across the globe.' 'Until Friday..' 'An aerospace is globally..' 'Was shut down for 24 hours.' 'All the metropolitan cities' 'are under tight security and surveillance.' 'Under the impact of its magnetic field' 'the world will be bereft of electricity for nine days.' I'm sorry to have called you today. This can't go on like this. See this? Last day, my son returned home in this state. Had the impact been a little lower he would've been blinded. Your son hurled a stone at him. I'm.. Sorry. Father, please give him one last chance.. - Albert! I'm answerable to other parents as well. I'm expelling Adam from this school. I'm sorry. Come, get in the car. It's your mid-term. Which school will admit you now? Moreover, will any school be ready to admit you? What should I write in your reference letter? That you're good at pelting stones at other kids! Adam, why can't you just be normal? Do you at least have a friend? Does anyone play with you? I'm fed up. I miss my mother. How can you miss someone whom you never met? I've told you several times that you've only me as a parent. Do you hear that? I'm all you have! You're not my mother.. Hey, Adam.. Do you feel any pain? No. - Do you feel a weight to your head? Yes, maybe because I cried the other day. You're completely all right. No problem at all. Come. You've grown up, Adam. I'm not even able to lift you up. Okay, big boy. Now, you must help your father. Don't be mad at anyone. Be friendly towards everyone. And study well. And become a great astrophysicist like your dad. Dad is angry at me. For now, yes. But that will change with time as he is your dad. You mean the world to him. How is he? - He is fine now. He is a bit upset. He is just a little kid. Some kids who don't get their mother's love become a little problematic. It's quite common. Albert, you must handle him more softly. And moreover, try to spend some time with him no matter how busy you are. That will put an end to all his problems. Rahul, I know, but sometimes it's really tough to manage him. I know.. 'I'll have to interrupt you.' 'We'll have global blackouts for nine days.' Two more weeks, right? So, what do you think? Will the world end? We don't need a comet for that. Human beings will bring the world to an end one day. Sir. - Sir. You were right. - Good morning, sir. Readings are spot on. As of now, any probability for the debris to drop is somewhere over the Indo-Chinese border. Didn't you two go home last day? - No, sir. See, in terms of space research this comet is passing too close to Earth. But in terms of actual distance, it is too much. So, the debris might make it through but most probably, it will drop in the ocean. Right, sir. - This time should be no different. Sir, everything okay? - Yes. All fine. - We know what tomorrow means to you. Must be tough. You could've taken a day off. No, that won't work out. Coming to the office is better than sitting at home and bothering. My sister can babysit your son if needed. I'll talk to her. - That's not needed. I've a maid at home. My son will be fine. Sir, did you get the news that our former chairman Dr. Inyath Khan has reached Delhi? Yes, I got to know. This year, it is him who is going to lead the government advisory panel, right? - Yes. There is a rumour that he might be visiting our office. Did he call you up? As you're his favourite student. No, usually, he never gets in touch. A surprise visit is in the cards. As he is a recluse with no email or phone. For the past five years, he was off the radar using the excuse of setting up a research centre in Brazil. With genius, comes a spark of madness as well. But what a man! He is a Noble Prize winner. Honoured with Padma Vibhushan. A leading cosmologist in the world. Sir, do give me a chance to meet him someday. I just want to take a selfie with him. After working for five years as his assistant I couldn't get photographed with him. And you need a selfie! Right, can I get to work now? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sure, sir. Have a nice day, sir. - You too. Happy birthday, Adam. Thank you, Dad. "Oh, graceful God, up in the skies." "The gloom of death looms large here.." "Bless us to soar higher, leaving all that behind.." "On the judgement day" "beaming with the pride of victory.." James. James. Do we really need to behave like strangers? My sister's death anniversary is not something that I can avoid. Usually, my family and I try to avoid visiting places where you and your son are present. He is just a kid, James. Is such a punishment necessary? Albert, it's my son who is enduring the punishment. Since last one year he has been restricted to that wheelchair. His chances of walking again.. Do you know something? I don't recall a night, going to bed without hearing Lissy's muffled sobs. Sometimes, I wish for him to be dead! It's okay. Your son is totally fine. That's more than enough. That was an accident, James. He didn't do that on purpose.. Shoving my son off the terrace for a petty argument, you call that an accident? We witnessed it, James. When Alex was about to fall off the parapet Adam tried to save.. - Lie! You don't know your son that well, Albert. He.. We were really happy when Annie told that she wanted to marry you. Your financial background or family status.. Nothing mattered to us. I liked you, Albert. Like my own brother. But your son, he killed my Annie first. Then he shattered my son's life. You've been suffering ever since he was born. Take it from me. As long as he is alive you won't live a life of happiness and peace. He! He is evil. James. "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday, dear Adam." "Happy birthday to you." James has not changed at all, right? His hatred and anger is growing with time, it seems. What about Adam? How did he take it? He didn't hear, it seems. Or perhaps, he pretended that he didn't hear anything. Isn't it one of the most brutal of God's silly pranks? A mother's death while delivering her baby. The whole family is confused whether to celebrate or grieve on that day, throughout their entire lives. It has been seven years. Seven years. That's a long time. I won't ask you to get married for Adam's sake. But you need a partner, right? Shall we find another Annie? Another Annie. Isn't that the problem? There is no one like her. Please sit down. When it was announced that my lecture was shifted from classroom to auditorium I wasn't expecting a sudden surge of interest in astrophysics. Anyway, I got to know that students of other courses are also present here. So, I guess, there is no point in taking today's class based on the curriculum. Shall we have a question and answer session? You may ask questions. I'll answer your question if I know the answer. What do you say? Lights. I will answer the first question before you even ask. This won't lead to the end of the world. Something we never experienced.. We are going to experience it. That's about it. As far as you all are concerned it'll be nine days without internet and social media platforms. Sir, where is this comet's origin? From the unknown. From an unknown galaxy which we haven't explored yet. To put it in perspective a comet bigger than Mount Everest is going to pass, close to the surface of Earth. And there will be a solar flare. As the news channels reported this comet has a strong electromagnetic field. I mean, it has a strong electromagnetic pulse. The comet's powerful EMP will influence Earth's electromagnetic field. Everything that makes use of electric energy be it huge hydrothermal plants or our mobiles phones and watches.. All of that will stop working. This magnetic field, which is more powerful than Earth's EMP will gradually lose its strength and after nine days it will vanish completely. Until then, all of us will be under its influence. The world will be in an electromagnetic bubble. Sir, there are many conspiracy theories about that in the Internet. Sure, there are several theories. It's up to our common sense to find out if any conspiracy is involved or not. One comet's debris is still on the face of Earth under the Bermuda Triangle, according to a theory. The theory says that its EMP is still active. According to some, aircrafts and ships stop receiving the satellite signals and meet with an accident because of that. I've a question. What do you've to say regarding the most famous conspiracy theory? Are comets actually messages from the aliens? Since ancient times, human beings have considered celestial bodies with a sense of foreboding. Especially comets. They are messengers of destruction according to a popular conception. Using prayers and other forms of rituals they tried to defend it. We've always been afraid of phenomena that are beyond our understanding. If you ask me you must not approach the next nine days with fear. Be proud of getting a chance to witness something historical. A similar phenomenon will be repeated only after millions of years from now. Before this, such a special comet had passed so close to Earth when Julius Caesar was still building his Roman empire. We, especially you guys must consider this as an opportunity. An opportunity to experience a phase of time which you had heard only as a fable. Social media movies, music, cars, bikes.. Nothing will work. All that you will be left with are sunrise, sunset wind, rain and nature. Let these nine days teach you how to socialise without the help of social media. For nine days.. At least, for these nine days let's be human again. 'For your convenience, we have an outdoor stall..' It's 3 a.m. Such a big crowd. Nowadays, it's open for 24 hours. It's a lot more busier during the day time. 'That stall is open for your convenience.' 'So, after finishing your purchase..' Look, candles, match stick, kerosene lamps.. As if an old era is on sale.. They're afraid they will run out of food and essentials. Hence, this sense of panic. Sir, will we face issues in getting the supplies? Won't there be a way to transport essentials to the market? How? For that, we need vehicles with thermal or mechanical engines. Engines with spark plugs or compression won't even start. How do we get those old vehicles? Even trains that use steam engines can be found only in the museums. We got rid of our old toys when we got new ones. Everyone is so busy, collecting the essentials. The problems that people are about to face during the next nine days.. People living in the cities are panicking more. Their lives have been turned upside down. Can we even imagine spending a day without electricity and internet? We can't even return to the villages as they don't exist anymore. Not just us. The entire world is facing this. Humanity will be tested in these nine days. Sir, how will we shop as it's such a huge crowd? Leave it. The owner of this hypermarket is my friend. Send me a list of items you need. I'll try to get it delivered to your houses. Thank you, sir. - 'Candles, lamps' 'oil, etc. are available.' 'We request all of you.. - It's the end of the world..' 'This comet symbolises the end of the world.' 'Join us. - Join us..' Oh, no! I didn't see that. Adam, come.. Let me have a look at you. You were a baby when I saw you last time. You're a big man now. Even you look old. You got it right. Come, let's go meet your dad. Look, I won't tell him about the flower vase. Deal? Come. Adam, enough. Come inside. You might be celebrating your rustication.. Doctor Khan. Hi, Albert. You haven't changed at all. You look still the same. Nothing changes much after a certain age. Even you've got some grey hair. You haven't forgotten Malayalam yet, right?' That's the benefit of learning languages. Once we get used to talking in a language how do I put it.. It gets hold of you. I was here for ten.. No. I was here for 15 years. I haven't seen you since a long time. Six years. We last met on Annie's first death anniversary. Annie. She was a gem. Indeed. Yes. To Annie. Annie. Cheers. Albert. This is not a courtesy visit. I came here to give you a task. Okay. Have you ever been to the mountains? Two years back, for a convention in Munnar.. Not those mountains. The big daddy. Himalayas. No. Heaven on Earth. I've a holiday home there. It was an old heritage hotel. Four years back I bought it out of a crazy impulse. I'd promised Time magazine to write an article for them. About the comet and its socio-cultural implications. But then, I got an official invite from the Chinese government. A seminar involving renowned cosmologists and astronomers.. And most of them are very close friends of mine. And the plan is.. We'll observe the comet live from the seminar location. I can't afford to miss that. So, I came here to tell you that on my behalf you'll do the data collection and research for that article. On the cover of Time Magazine your name will be featured as the co-author. Come on. How long are you planning to be in this job? People should know you. Time will put you on the map. Sir, but do I need to go there for that? I can do the same from here as well, right? This is why I like you so much. You always ask the right question. Sit. Albert, don't consider it just as a place. It's one of the ancient corners of this world. And those mountains have such tales to tell you. A village full of rituals and all kinds of superstitions.. There are two tribal groups and their perennial battle inside the forest. We've an ancient Buddhist monastery which maintains peace. Both the tribal groups have united now. There is only one emotion behind it. Fear. Fear instilled by the comet. But they are not the only ones who fear that comet. In a way, everybody is scared of it. They knew about this comet millions of years before the scientific world. On the walls of their caves are written the ancient scriptures stating the passing of another red comet ages ago and its imminent return. And you know what. Their prediction was spot on. And now, the red comet is going to come again on the very day that they predicted millions of years back. That is one of the very few places from where we can witness that comet. You can see her there. Once the comet passes the sky will turn red, owing to the comet's glow for the whole nine days. Exactly how the paintings inside those caves depicted. And that's why they are scared. What do you say? Of course, I'll do it, sir. Good. It will be a change for Adam as well. There is a lot of space for him to play football. You'll have a caretaker. His name is Hakka. He is a native. He will take care of everything including cooking. I'll arrange everything that you want. Form a team and plan the travel as soon as possible. I'll be there on the eighth day. But how will you travel during this span? I've my ways, my son. I've my ways. Doctor Inyath Khan. Really? Yes, the one and only. He told me to assemble a team for research. I need two of you, only if you guys are interested. I'm ready. - So am I, sir. Good. Two employees of ISA Delhi will join us. That makes a team of four. I suppose that is enough for this assignment. Do you guys have jackets and woollen sweaters? If not, you've to but it because we'll leave in two days. Greetings. - Hakka. - Yes. I've kept your belongings in your room, sir. Thank you. Is this hotel still operating? - No, sir. For now, it's nothing but Mr. Khan's guest house. Once in a blue moon, his friends or his guests comes here. Okay. So, guys, this is.. - Ibrahim Naaz, IIT Kanpur. Hi, I'm Sandeep. - Divya. Neerav Vatekar, IIT Guwahati. - Hello, I'm Sandeep. It was tough, sir. But I managed to get the rooms. Almost all places must be brimming with people who are here to see the comet. I'm insisting once again. You guys can stay with me. There is a lot of room over there. Okay, if that's the case.. - No need, sir. If we come there, you'll transform it into an office. Adam needs some leisure time with you, in the evenings. He needs it. That is an observation post, abandoned by the army after the war of 1962. We can set up the tents. Don't get used to it, guys. Only for the next nine days do we have this office space. After that, it is again going to be glass houses in concrete jungles. Step down. The headlights won't work. So, in order to light a fire.. Right. I am keeping the Landcruiser for myself. This one was converted into a right-hand drive at a local workshop. An old 43-model Willys was restored to make this. I've jotted down the instructions to install a manual crank-shaft. Okay. - Will you guys be able to manage or should I help? - Sir, well.. We'll manage, sir. Good. Sleep well tonight. Because tomorrow, she comes. After that, we won't have time to rest. Away from all.. A haven, away from everyone. You would've loved this place, Annie. "Like a glimmering star, won't you come to me, my dear?" "With your gorgeous smile, light up my days and nights.." "After a long wait that spanned ages" "I met you at the crossroads." "Though you defined my life" "why did you fade away in an instant?" "Like a glimmering star, won't you come to me, my dear?" "With your gorgeous smile, light up my days and nights.." "I've fallen for you, dear." "All my dreams revolve around you now." "I don't want to spend a moment away from you." "Never apart from you, dear.." "I've fallen for you, dear." "All my dreams revolve around you now." "I don't want to spend a moment away from you." "Never apart from you, dear.." "Never shall we be apart, so you whispered in my ears.." "Forgetting all that, you're drifting away from me.." "Like an ephemeral rainbow, you were gone.." "As my eyes well up, I yearn for you.." "Life seems to be too long." "Am I searching for you in vain?" "The pain of your separation scorches me" "tears just trickle down to form a river." "After a long wait that spanned ages" "I met you at the crossroads." "Though you defined my life" "why did you fade away in an instant?" "Like a glimmering star.." Just the two of us hanging out won't last for long, Albert. What? I'm pregnant. Good night, Annie. I'm not a man for words. But today, we're about to witness a historic event! We're at the right place, at the right time. Keep your eyes on the sky, guys. It only happens once. We've three optical telescopes to watch the passing comet. You may use this watch tower. - What about you, sir? I've a spot in my mind. Hello. Hello.. She is quite sick. If she doesn't wake up by tomorrow morning we would've to call the doctor. Hakka, you may leave. We're good. I'll come tomorrow morning and prepare breakfast. The comet's trail. Don't be afraid, Hakka. It won't bother us a bit. It's a bad omen, sir. Extremely ominous. Adam, why are you here? Go on, go to bed. Adam, when did you wake up? Go brush your teeth, come on. Who are you? Where am I? Who are you? Where am I? Don't worry. You're safe here. I saw you in the woods near Baruva last night. You ran into me. It was too cold and snowing. I couldn't just abandon you in such a state, could I? I've a bad headache. I'm surprised that it's only a headache. So, how did you get here? What's your story? Ava, that's my name. I'm coming from Delhi. I had few friends with me. I thought I'd get a good view of the comet from the valley. A huge crowd had assembled there. Few of us, stepped aside from the crowd and went into the woods. While we were searching for a good view point I lost my way. I was so scared! All of a sudden, I felt an object hitting the ground! That's all I remember. What actually hit the ground was a piece of the comet. That hitting the surface of Earth, happens once in several eons. But what is even more surprising is that you survived the accident. At that instant.. I don't know if you were fully conscious but you deposited a piece of comet in your bag. As it was too hot your bag and the items in it were burned. Why did I deposit it in my bag? - Exactly. Why? You've a fever. You may rest here until you recover. I've to go to a place. My caretaker, Hakka, is here. If you need anything, let him know. Okay? My son, Adam.. He is bit naughty. I'll tell him. But in case, he comes this way just ignore him. - Thank you. Take rest. Please go to the base camp and tell my assistants that I won't be coming today. Ask them to get started with the work and I'll be there tomorrow. Okay? Adam. I'm going somewhere. That girl is not well, she is taking rest. So, don't go into her room and disturb her when I'm not around. Okay? Bye. Who are you? What? Adam.. I know. Your dad told me about you. It's rude to stare at someone. What's that in your hand? My flipbook. - Let me take a look. Show me. Who all are in this? Me and my mom. But I didn't see your mom. I don't have a mom. - Oh, I'm sorry. Where is your dad in this? - I don't draw him. Why? - We don't get along much. He is always busy. Don't you have any friends out here, Adam? No. Can I be your friend? Will you be my friend? - Yes! Come. Your dad is out of your mind. Okay. How did this happen? Pass it. - He doesn't make friends that quickly. It's good. That he found some company. It'll last only till the red contour fades away. Everything will be back to how it was once it is gone. Everything. All of it. Okay. Isn't it time for you to leave? Your family must be waiting for you. My God is my family. Then, you should go home and pray to your God. God is always by my side, he resides in my heart. I know, but please leave soon.. You work so hard in here. - No. It's okay. See, I'm telling you, please leave. Yes. Don't you feel cold? Isn't your dad a scientist? Just imagine his workload. Still, he takes you along everywhere. Yes, but I like my mom. How can you be so sure? You haven't seen your mom. You're just imagining things. Some people in our lives disappoints us, at times. Shut up! My mom is perfect. Of course, she is. I'm sorry. Have you drawn other pictures like this? Yes, but I don't like drawing in a book. Then? I like to sketch on the wall. - Really? Yes. But dad won't allow me. He'll scold me, right? A 7 year old can do anything that makes him happy. Nobody should ever forbid kids from sketching on the wall. Go ahead and draw. - No. Trust me, I'm telling you. Nobody will scold you, go. Don't worry. - He won't shout at me? No. - Promise me. I promise. Is this a bad time? Hey, come. So, you're a scientist? Astrophysicist, actually. Beautiful, isn't it? - Yes. A kind of terrifying beauty. Like a door to another realm altogether. What all secrets will be hidden behind that red contour? So, where are you from? Your home and native.. Far away from here. You wouldn't happen to know that place. What about your parents? Over there. Oh.. I'm sorry. Your friends would still be in the valley, right? I think so, we'll find out tomorrow. I'll go in the morning. Thank you so much for having me. Adam will miss you for sure. He doesn't have any other friends here. Me too. The gramophone won't work. Modern vinyl record players work on electricity. But not this one. Adam is asleep. I didn't feel like waking him up. Tell him that I bid goodbye to him. Sure. Ava.. The piece of the comet.. You may keep it. What will I do with that? Scientists must have a lot to learn from it. Well.. Thanks. Thank you so much for everything. Pleasure. And who knows whether we meet once again? Yes. Small world, right? Bye, take care. - Bye. All of you are quite lucky to see this red sky for nine days. What do you think about it? We don't like it. The red colour is inauspicious. It's the symbol of destruction. Excuse me. Shall I ask a question? No.. Do you feel bad when you see this? It spells danger, no matter when you see it. When moon comes out, we are afraid. How much is it? Why are you here? Get lost! Don't ever come back. You do know, right? If I wish, then this ring won't be able to save you. Hi. Hi, didn't you leave yet? Did you see your friends? Yes, I did. They were waiting for me. - Where are they now? Well.. They left to Kaza. Since I don't have any spare clothes I thought of shopping around. Everything in the bag was burned, right? I came to know that there are shops ahead. So.. I'll be leaving soon. They must be waiting for me there. You would've to cross the bridge to get to the valley. It is more than 10 kilometres away from here. How will you go? - I'll manage. Some horse cart will come by. No need of that, I'll drop you. Well.. Okay, superb. - Come. Sir, what happened here? You can't go this way. The road is all ruined. It'll be tough to cross, there is no other way. You will have to return. - How? I don't know. It'll be better for you to return. It's getting dark. This happened last night. There is no way to get to the other side. Any boats available? Even if you get one, you won't reach your destination. The water is too turbulent. This is the only road that can take you to that side. Until the power is restored, the bridge can't be repaired. Once it is done, emergency cases can be airlifted. Now, what will you do to get to your friends? It's okay. They'll find out about the bridge. Shall we go back to the cottage? Why don't you stay with us? No, drop me at the village. I'll stay there. Trust me, all the lodges in the valley are full. Also, if you return, Adam will be very happy. Adam! I am so scared, Dad. You do know to scribble on the walls, right? It's high time for you to sleep alone now! He is scared, it seems! Zip your mouth and go to sleep. I've a lot of work. Don't disturb me for anything! Didn't your dad warn you not to disturb him? You should listen to dad. I-I am afraid.. You should be! Who are you? What are you? Little kids should avoid asking such questions. Kids should remain what they are. Dad! No.. Leave me. Dad! Please leave me. Let go! Dad! I want to see my dad. If you utter another word I'll come back again and I'll hurt you. Adam.. It's me, dear. Dad.. - Come. What happened? It's okay. Good morning. What is the matter? It's nothing. This happens, at times. Some bad dream while asleep and he's wide awake. Sir, the breakfast is ready. - Okay. Come on, get ready, we'll have breakfast downstairs. Okay? You may go. I'll bring him. What you saw last night wasn't a dream. That was real. Wake up and see this world, Adam. You've got very little time left in this world. The curry is scrumptious, Hakka. I don't deserve the praise for it. I thought I'd help Hakka. I made it. - Wow. This is amazing, I mean.. It's salty and spicy as per my liking. It's like.. Like you know me. Who are you? Why did you come with my dad? Adam, she is our guest. - I want to know. Who are you? Why did you come here? Adam, quiet! I'm.. I'm sorry. He is.. You won't understand, Dad! Never ever! Adam! At times, he is.. Hey, it's okay. He is a child. I rebuked him a lot yesterday. Hence, the antics. I'm sorry, Dad.. I'm sorry too. Will you leave me once again, Dad? When did I ever leave you, Adam? Listen. At times, I get angry. And I shout at you. But that doesn't mean that I'll leave you. Promise me. I promise. We'll do one thing. Come with me to the base camp. Over there, Divya and Sandeep are waiting to meet you. What say? - Okay. Go and get your bag. Adam, good morning. He was too bored of sitting there idly. So, I thought of taking him along. Hey, are you okay? - Yes. He is not in a good mood. It will improve if he sees you. I know that. You will take care of him, right? Absolutely. Come, let's take a walk. Nobody will harm you as long as I'm here. Adam, relax. I'll tell your dad everything that happened. Okay? No need to be scared. Sir, I've some great news. A message from Ki Monastery. La Rumpa has allotted some time to meet with you. Tomorrow morning. - That's good. I wasn't expecting this to happen so soon. They've specially mentioned that this meeting shouldn't be missed by any means. It's a rare occasion. - Yes, I know. Should I come along with you? It's okay. I'll go on my own. Okay. - You carry on. Sir, the readings. - Yes, thanks. You'll drop Divya, right? - What? Divya said that you'll drop her. Oh.. Sure, I'll drop her. - Have a good day, sir. Bye. - Bye. Go home with Hakka now, dear. I'll see you soon, okay? Dad, I'm afraid. Since when did this start? Who are you afraid of? Stay with him till I return, Hakka. Sure, sir. Go on. What happened? Why aren't you leaving with the team? Adam told me that a visitor is there at your house. You didn't tell us about it, I'm just curious. If you want to see her you're free to come by any time. You know what, sir? Sounds like a good idea. Why don't we just go and meet her at once? What is it, Divya? What's the problem? Have you ever spent some time with Adam? Have you ever cared for him or tried to understand his feelings? Behaving like an adult.. - Wait. Wait. I haven't given you the freedom to impart advice on my personal life. You're my research assistant and that's it. I know how to raise my son. I don't need any help from others. I'm sorry, sir, I'm not prying into your personal matters but there is a fact that you should know. I'm trying to help you. That girl.. - Divya. If there is anything regarding this research we may discuss about it. If not, get in the jeep. I'll drop you. Also, the log that contains today's readings is upstairs. Can you please note it down? Hi. - Hi. I walked a lot today. I was on the way to home. The sight of this helped me recall. We shall go together, right? - Yes, sure. I'm glad that you came by. My assistant was eager to meet you. Is that Divya? How do you know her? Adam must've told you, right? I know her and that too, very well. Hey, you okay? You look too disturbed. It has been a tiring day. There is a remedy to cure stress. Close your eyes. - What? Close your eyes. Whenever I was tensed, my father used to sing this song for me. It's magic. Trust me. Okay. She is alive, breathing normally. But critical. - Doctor.. Taking her to another hospital, is it going to be helpful? This is a small clinic. The town is too far and the bridge is gone. No other means of transportation as well. So, you understand, right? Okay, Doctor. Thank you. - Okay. Is Adam asleep? Does he know? - Yes, sir. Hakka, go to the lodge and ask Sandeep and team to stay back here for the night. Okay? Adam. Why are you standing here all alone? Go to your bed now. Dad, I want to tell you something. What is it? Tell me. In private, just you and me. Tell me, Adam. Dad, no one else but us should be here. What! Who else is here? Ava will find out whatever I tell you. Adam, what are you blabbering? Ava is not what you think she is, Dad. Why did you bring her here on the night when the comet passed? Why won't she leave despite her wanting to leave? No, Dad. We don't need Ava between us. What happened to you, dear? I'm worried about you. I can't sleep, Dad. Ava is not what you see on the outside! And Divya.. That was not an accident. She was pushed off the tower. Adam, I witnessed Divya slipping and falling off the watch tower. Ava was next to me at that time. Exactly my point. What you're seeing is not the truth. Ava is not what you think she is. That comet.. It is Ava. Ava is the comet, Dad. Dear.. Who is telling you all this? Dad, please, listen to me.. - No. And I thought.. Ava was your friend. She loves you so much. Dad, let's get out of here right away. Right now, let's go. I need to stay here for another week. What about me then? Don't you need me? You're all I have. As long as I'm around, nobody will harm you. I know, I'll be safe as long as you're there but.. Adam, get some sleep. Everything will be all right. I am afraid, Dad. Until recently, you were afraid of the watchmen at our apartment. You weren't afraid of him after a few days. This too is something similar. Be a good boy and go to sleep. Okay. Good night. You clever boy! I came down here to take you with me. You can't do anything about it. If you divulge anything to anyone, I'll kill you. Not just you, even your dad! I'll leave on the ninth night, taking you along. Breathe, little boy.. What happened? Aren't you coming? Don't you want to see the monastery? Yes. But I'll have a good look at it from here. I like admiring things from a distance. Besides, they don't have a view like this where I'm from. Okay. See you then. - Okay. Are you afraid of this comet? Not at all. It's just a glimmer of that great power. Tell me something, dear. Do you believe in that force? You mean God? I.. I am a man of science. And still, you're standing here. Seeking answers to the questions that you don't understand. The things that are beyond our understanding.. The attempt to understand them is called science, right, sir? I can see fear in your eyes. What would someone who believes in science be afraid of? I'm afraid of both those possibilities. That's the question that scares me. You're engulfed in darkness. The kind of darkness that can destroy you. What do you mean? He is your son and it's your duty to protect him. This is your destiny. You have to face the darkness and defeat it. Only you can do it. Protect your son or the darkness will destroy both of you. I shall pray for you to see the light, my son. It can't enter here, Dad. What? Prayers. As everyone is praying here it can't enter here. The doctor said her condition is still critical. The condition has improved a bit. She has broken her bones, her ribs.. But there is still hope. But how will she come out of the coma.. Yes, l-let's hope for the best. What exactly happened? I don't know. I was right there. She might have slipped. No way. The railing is tall enough. It's highly unlikely for her to trip and fall. Sir, she was very upset yesterday evening. Who told you so, Sandeep? Don't assume things that we don't know. I'm sorry, sir. I'm just tired. You may go home if you want. I will be here. I will see you. - Yes. Are you leaving tonight, Hakka? Please don't go. I will be left alone. Keep this with you. You won't have to fear anything now. Thank you, Hakka. You may go home now. It is too late into the night. You might lose your way in this darkness. The Lord will show me the way. Let's see. Adam. Adam. Adam.. How many times had I warned you not to tell anyone? But you divulged everything to your dad. You told him that I can't enter the monastery, right? I know everything. Everything. Why are you looking at me like you are seeing me for the first time, sir? Don't believe everything that you see, Albert. Your eyes can lie. You are left alone, right, Albert? I miss you, Annie, all the time. Me too. I know. Ever since I left, you've never been happy. Your anger, agony frustration, hate.. I can see all of it. I feel every moment of it. This is a dream. You are not real. Have you ever thought how our lives would've been had it changed a bit.. If the decisions we had made were a bit different.. How different things would have been? I would still have been with you. He ruined everything, didn't he? He took it all away. Annie, what are you saying? Isn't it true, Albert? He first separated me from you. He then shattered your happiness and peace of mind. Every time you saw him you were full of grief, thinking about me, right? Should I believe the lie that you've been telling yourself all these years, Albert? Do you really love him? How many times have you thought if he hadn't been with you? He was a mistake, Albert. He was a mistake we made. We need to correct that mistake. Give him to me. You don't need him anymore. I am his mother and I will take him far away. He will never ever bother you. Adam! Come on. Let's go, Dad. Dad.. Let's go.. Come on. You may sleep. I am with you. No one will hurt you anymore. Is that a promise? I promise. Don't leave me alone, Dad. You are all I've got. I will be a good child from now. How can I leave you, dear? You are all I have got, right? Sandeep, who is at the hospital? - Ibrahim. Okay. Stay here with Adam until I come back. Dad, where are you going? I have some things to do. Mr. Sandeep will be with you. I will be back soon. Will you? - I will. Hey. Be with him. - Yes, sir. Sir, is everything okay? Hakka! This comet is toying with people's brains. What you just said can never happen. Listen. The whole world is after it. Sir, my assistant is fighting against death at the hospital. My caretaker is missing. I feel, something has happened to him. We have the report from the hospital, sir. She slipped and fell as per your report. And your caretaker is a tribal man. He might have gone in to the forest to his people. So, there isn't anything you can do for me now, right? No. Not for the next four days. You are young and healthy. Protect yourself and listen.. Try everything you can to stay alive. What if she tries to kill you? Hey.. Your dad hasn't come yet, Adam. Shall we go to the lodge? No, he said that he'd take me to a place. He wanted you to take me there if he is late. Shall we write a note to let him know we've gone to the lodge? No! He asked me to go there in case he is late. Dad will not come here and so, he won't find the note. All right.. Neerav, won't you walk to the lodge? - Yes. I have to take him somewhere. - Okay. - Okay. Adam, where did he want me to take you? - Ki Monastery. Neerav, where is Adam? He isn't at the base camp. Sir, he went with Sandeep. - Where? Ki Monastery. Adam asked Sandeep to take him there. Adam said you'd come there. Didn't you say that? The monastery.. Well done, Adam. Can't you drive faster? No.. The road is narrow. It's very dangerous. It will be even more dangerous if we don't go faster. - What? What are you talking about? Jeez. We can't pass through. Let me move it. - No. Let's go. W-What if it's alive, Adam? Please, sir. Let's go. - Adam. - I beg you. Why are you acting this way? The monastery is near, isn't it? We will be there soon. Please don't worry. Hakka. Adam. Dear.. Adam.. Hakka. Hakka. Hakka.. What happened to you? Hakka. Adam.. It's me, your dad. - No.. Hey! Adam.. Adam.. Adam.. Albert. Dr. Khan. W-When did you.. Adam.. Where is he? Some villagers brought you here last night and you were almost unconscious. I met with Divya, Sandeep and Hakka. The only information I have is what you'd told me in the last 10 hours. Albert, listen carefully to what I'm going to tell you. Sir.. Sir, what are you.. Ava.. Where is she? Ava.. She doesn't exist, Albert. There was never an Ava. What? Albert, the greatest darkness in the universe is not within a black hole, Albert. It's inside the human mind. Every human has that dark side in him. That darkness is the hatred you harboured against your son which grew inside you without your knowledge. In all his acts of mischief.. Every rebuke that James aimed at him.. Every moment in which you missed Annie.. The darkness grew. When it reached a tipping point you needed a form for the hatred that you harboured against him and a reason to justify it. Ava is that reason, Albert. She was the darker side of you. She was you. You are suffering from bipolar schizophrenia. You are the only one who has seen Ava. I.. I don't understand. Just retrace your memory. Day one. The day that comet passed.. Witnessing a spectacle like that all alone.. That tipping point which unbalanced you.. That could have been it. You didn't realise that you are the only one who came back that night. Day two. You didn't go to the base camp. - No. I went back into the woods that day. Then, I.. - Correct. You were really worried when you got back. That day unlike all days, you were asleep in the poolside cottage and Adam came to see you there. He was happy when you showed him the affection that you had never shown him before. The joy of his dad being his friend for the first time. 'Can I be your friend?' 'Will you be my friend? - Yes.' 'Come.' 'Your dad is out of his mind!' 'But dad won't agree to it. Won't he rebuke me?' 'Trust me. I am telling you.' That day, he realised that something is wrong with his dad. 'Didn't your dad warn you not to disturb him?' 'You should really listen to him. - I am scared.' 'You should be. - Who are you?' 'Kids shouldn't ask too many questions.' 'D-Dad, please leave me..' When he got scared after seeing you next morning you thought he had a nightmare. 'Adam. - Dad.' 'What you saw last night wasn't a dream.' 'That was real.' He tried talking to Ava after that hoping that you'd understand the reality. 'I mean, it's salty and spicy as per my liking.' 'It's like.. Like you know me.' 'Who are you? Why did you come here with my dad?' 'Adam, she is a guest.' 'Dad, you won't understand. Never ever. - Hey!' Amongst your team members, he was close to Divya. And he told her everything. 'Sir, I am trying to help you.' 'That girl.. - Divya.' When Ava realised that Divya would be a threat to her very existence as she'd realised the truth.. That is, you.. Got rid of her. 'Divya!' Your son is way too brilliant for a seven-year-old. In one of those moments, he realised that you were Albert and told you everything that he knew about Ava. 'Ava will know everything that I tell you, Dad.' 'Ava..' 'No, Dad. We don't need Ava between us.' But unfortunately Ava processed everything that Albert had heard and you hurt him again. 'How many times had I warned you..' 'Not to tell anyone..' 'I know everything.' The moment La Rumpa saw you at the monastery he realised the darkness within you. 'Protect your son or this darkness will consume both of you.' Every moment that Adam spent with you in fear wondering whether you were Albert or Ava he tried to help you realise the changes that were happening inside you. 'Dad, I want to speak with you alone.' 'Just the two of us, Dad.' He kept on giving you clues but you couldn't realise it. Everything that happened later.. Hakka, Sandeep.. It was you, Albert. Sandeep is all right. He sustained a minor head injury. Hakka will be bedridden for another two months. Divya is still in a coma. Adam.. My son.. He.. - What did he do to him, Albert? Only Ava knows the answer. But as I said Ava is inside you. So, ask yourself. What did you do to your son? You are wrong, Dr. Khan. I could never hurt my son. I love my son. And Ava.. She.. The things that she said to me.. All of it is real. I know. I saw her. I heard her. One person can prove that what I said is true. Only that person can do it. Adam, your son. It's the eighth night today. You have one more day left. On the tenth morning I will call the police. I will give you the ninth day. To find out your son if he is alive. Go, Albert. Find him before it's too late. I know she is real. Can you give me an answer? I can't answer your question. You are writing your own story. It is up to you to decide how it ends. If you feel she is real, find her. If she is inside you, identify the darkness. Go to her world and she will show you your biggest fear. You just have a few hours left. Find her. Find Adam. Where is the child? He is my son and even I am looking for him. Please move out of my way. We know that it's you who took him. And we also know about what you did to Hakka. Tell us. Where is the child? Listen. I don't have much time and I have to find my son. Please. Wait. Hey! Don't you touch me! Don't you lay your hands on me! Stop. Only I can find my son. If I lose him, I will definitely come back for you. Go and find your son. If you don't find him or if something happens to Hakka don't you dare come to this forest again. Ava! Ava! Ava! Where is Adam? Tell me. You know where he is. Ava. - Ava.. Did you forget me so soon, Albert? Ms. Mercy. I needed a face that you'd forgotten. I found it in Ms. Mercy, your favourite teacher. He was a mistake you made. There are a lot of things you can accomplish in your life. You are meant for greater things. Why have a son who hinders your progress? Just forget him. I will take him. You will be free then, Albert. Do you think I can live after handing him over to you? Irrespective of who and what you are I promise you if I don't get my son back I will kill myself. Why, Albert? Why should you die for your son? Because I love him. Because I am his father. Ancient humans were like us. And gradually, they changed. The world changed them protected them and handed them weapons. A weapon that was strong and beyond our understanding. Love, affection. Humanity. Earth's biggest weapon. The only weapon that you have against me. And you have used that. I want to know whether your love is true. Look to the sky. When the red colour fades away, I will go. And Adam will come along with me. You just have a few minutes to save your son. How? How could I.. Where? I-I don't remember. Just tell me. No. No. Don't go. Annie. Our son.. I couldn't save him. I killed him. I killed our son. Adam.. Adam! Adam. Adam. Adam. Adam. Adam. Adam. Adam.. Dear.. Adam.. Dear.. Adam.. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. Dad. Adam. - Dad. Are you okay? I love you so much. I love you! I love you so much. - I love you too, Dad. My dad had told me that we'd get the answers to all our questions from there. But the question that I've in my mind now.. Only you can answer it. Ava. Was she real? 'On the walls of their caves are written the ancient scriptures' 'stating the passing of another red comet ages ago' 'and its imminent return.'
