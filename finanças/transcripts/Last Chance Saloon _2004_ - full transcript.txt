LAST CHANCE SALOON The kid is me. Yann. I grew up on the Ile de Groix. Heard of it? No? No one has. On my dad's side, we're oyster farmers. Just seeing one makes me itch. Tara, my best friend, was a real sweetie. Chocolate, cakes... She ate the lot. She had one problem: she was scared of everything. Kathy, my best friend, was beautiful, smart, sweet... She had lots going for her. Except her mum. A single hippy mum, who was always high. Did I say "sweet"? Adolescence can change you. Ah, adolescence! A difficult age, especially on the island. This child's paradise was a nightmare for teens. When the last ferry's at 10:30pm, it's way too early. I never imagined these girls would save my life. I'm going too fast. Back to me. There were no openings for me in the sailors' world. That's for sure. Hey faggot, go cluck with the seagulls! You jerks! Racists! Morons! If his brothers were here... Fuck! If we leave, let's always stick together. You swear? I swear. Promise! When do we leave? After 18 years of seagulls and fresh air, we dreamt of pigeons and the subway. We didn't have the right look to conquer Paris but we had confidence. Well... I did. At first, Tara really struggled. But thanks to the guys I met, I found her a job where she could express her creativity. - I have to ask for an advance. - Again? Her main defect was her obsessive optimism. He agrees. Kathy, willful and unscrupulous, was the feared head accountant of a new ad agency where she fit in perfectly. Hello! What a bitch! I'd been a waiter at The Blue Boy for 6 months when I met Salomé, a rising young fashion designer who stimulated her talent with margaritas. I picked her out of the gutter, she offered me a job. I fast became indispensable. You look like a lump! This is it! This is it! The girl from Elle loves it! An article with 3 pages of photos. Thank you, my press attaché honey! Tara Le Bihan, do you take as husband Jacques Lagourde? The girls' love lives were a total disaster. No. After saving her from a catastrophic marriage, still looking for Prince Charming, Tara found us a gem, Thomas, a geography teacher in a training college, aptly nicknamed The Toad by his students. And by us too. Well done! Hey, Thomas, don't look at me that way! I look terrible today. Dumpy Dinah dined on delicious dumplings. Where's the salami? Maybe Barbie ate it. Huh, Barbie? I've got to get to the store before it closes. Maybe you should buy those 0 calorie meals. You're right. But it's so disgusting. It's all I have. Say... you haven't paid me your rent. I'm sorry. I'll write you a check this week. Kathy considered all men as her personal enemies. Her dad dumped her mum the day before her birth. Doesn't help matters. Kathy, for my expenses, can I have a word? No. I'm way too busy. - I thought you'd be late for once. - No way! - Don't want to change cars? - I still don't. - Maybe we could have lunch. - What for? To discuss the budget for the next ad. Working while eating is great! I love getting my files greasy. Have a good day! In Paris, I made up for lost time. I drank lots, slept little, cruised loads, and had some great catches. More than back home. I thought I was happy. Then one day I met Alfredo. Adorable cultural attaché at the Italian embassy. Yes, girl! See how I love you. Our relationship made Thomas uneasy. He didn't get men kissing. Couldn't see the point. We slowly discovered something that had been concealed: as you grow older, time speeds up. 33! How awful! That's it. We're screwed. There we go! When I'm 33, I'll crucify myself. I'll impale myself. I don't why but I prefer it. Here. We had it made in Lorient, at old Le Guennec's. Behind the lighthouse, it's your dad's sardine store. There's your dad! - Hey you! - What? - You've lost more weight. - Where? How do you do it, lucky sod? Simple: tequila, joints, and no exercise ever. Oh no! No exercise ever. Still on a diet? Totally! And... Thomas, did he forget to come? He hates birthdays. What a pain! Be understanding. It isn't his fault. He was abandoned by his mum on his 6th birthday! We know. And where's Alfredo? He, at least, has a good excuse. He's a bridesmaid at Peter and Eric's wedding. A wedding... my dream! What's does your teacher think? Oh, he's so reserved. He never mentions it but... he's a ball of affection. Men affect to love to get you into bed. And girls get into bed to get affection. Which category are you in? Me? Both. Coming to Yann's party? Yes. I've found a fab top. Sure you're coming? Maybe not, no. Say sorry to Yann for me? My princess! Hello honey! Easy, Jean-Marc! No one can see us. - Let's go to mine! - I don't have much time. I'm taking Anne-Sophie and the kids to La Baule. I'll zip down and come back for you, my panther. Have you told her? No, not yet. But I promise I will. I'll have time on the way. She'll get it. My panther! We still went out and drank lots, but no one cruised. Kathy out of principle and Tara out of love for batrachians. I'm talking about Thomas the Toad. Keep up! - Gorgeous! - We didn't see you in Deauville. You know how it is with all the shows. - Here at last! - Vanessa, honey, the last chance club. Here you are! Where's the buffet? We always met the same sorts. Showbiz scroungers, third-rate actors after a role. I'd love to screw a young heiress, me. You're with Vanessa, you can't do her daughter. A bit of mum-daughter rivalry won't hurt anyone! All these girls! Listen to your master, Max. Find an ugly girl with a pretty friend. Hit on the ugly girl. It'll work because she's ugly. Piqued, the pretty girl hits on you, and you screw them both. Got any more tips? - Fat ones aren't so lazy. - Talking about yours, girl? That guy's a poof! Fab party, Chloé. When's your film out? The Secret of the Lake? I dunno. They're a pain. The channels are fighting over it. - But I can get you the DVD. - That'd be cool. I'd love to know what you think of it. Are old are you now? - 18. - Oh wow, really! Hey, do you have a boyfriend... Are you two friends? It shows. Hey Tara! - Annie, what are you doing here? - Your top's fab. Does Salomé pay you to wear her clothes? Don't touch. I've got a sore throat. I don't want to be sick before the collection. You've always got something wrong with you. Drink less and go to bed early. But I go to bed very early! At 7, 8... 2pm in the morning! I can't stand this music. I feel like an old granny. Try having a nip and tuck. I'm off to the ladies' room. Who's making the room move? Wait... Why don't we go back to the lounge? No. We haven't finished our chat, little darling. Oh dear me! Guess I'm too late. Have a good night. As Mac Arthur said in the Philippines, I'll be back. That was super! Yes... You know... The other day, I saw a great show on TV on the benefits of massage... stroking... foreplay, basically. What do you think? Kathy's sex life was a mystery. Me and Tara were sure she had wild sex with guys she felt ashamed of. For me, she was one hot ice queen. Hello? - It's Mum. Am I disturbing you? - I'm working. - I need some money. - Again? It's to pay the 2nd installment. You don't mind, do you? I already sent you a cheque. - I got the first llama. - What? - I have to pay for the couple. - A llama farm? In Groix? - Mum, quit smoking joints. - You say that... The Dietetikrem budget. As usual, for yesterday. By way of an apology... Two backstage passes for the U2 concert. Bring your llama. Did you know that sexual harassment in the workplace, is a punishable offence? I was off my face at 5am, and you know what? No. I met an actor who starred in Secret of the Lake. What's that? A Swiss reality TV show? He called me. He fancies me! Annie, I have to go because... I'm completely snowed under. See you, bye! Carrots are my friends. Carrots are my friends. The carrots can go fuck themselves! And the lettuce. Thomas will hate me. My expenses, Lady Findus. - What did you call me? - Lady Findus. That's what everyone calls you. Because I don't suck off everyone in the agency. My friends' fierce obstinacy to be unhappy was seriously starting to bug me. Mauritius. Royal Palm Hotel, louxury 5 star. - Luxury. - Luxury. - Its giant prawms. - Prawns! That's what I said! Temple tours with multi-tongued guide. Multi-tongued? I feel better already. I thought you might. Have you told the girls? No. No yet, mi amore. Amore mio. You're cute with your little iron! And its big steam engine! Che calor! - How do you do it? - Huh? I definitely do it better when you're not here. Scram! And then, one day, my life turned upside down. Madam? Excuse me! No.130 has gone. Already? But that's impossible. - Stop crying, you. - Shut up! Ah! There they are. We thought you were dead. What's going on, Yann? I should've told you sooner. Right. I've good news and bad news. Want do you want first? The good news. Huh, Kathy? The good news. The good news is... I am definitely, without a shadow of a doubt, 100% seronegative. So you don't have AIDS? No. What great news! And the bad news? The bad news is I've caught something quite interesting better known as Hodgkin's disease. What's that? A problem with my lymphatic system. Like lymphatic drainage? No, it's... It's a form of cancer. You need a biopsy. I've had the biopsy. Did you think I'd slit my throat? I had a little lump here which grew as a big as a kiwi. They removed it to see, and given what they saw, I need the lot: x-rays, MRI, punctures, etc. In the fashion world, it's always go, go, go. The results will tell us what needs to be done. - When will you get them? - In two weeks' time. Does your mum know? No. You have to tell her. There are so many things I should've told her. - We'll call her. Huh, Kathy? - Oh yes! You can handle her. Thanks, girls. I'm tired. Let's go back to my room. Your mum, how should I be with her? Like the boyfriend of a gay with cancer, who's never come out to her. I feel like I'm polishing ashtrays on the Titanic. I can't. You do it. As usual! Jeanne-Marie? It's Kathy. Man learnt to control the atom. Now he has to control himself. Thomas! What time do you call this? I told you to feed Barbie. She only ate when Daddy got her. Huh, my poor starving baby? What's wrong? Yann has a cancer of the lymphatic system. For sure? Absolutely sure. Come on, Tara. Think about it. The lymphatic system is part of the immune system. So he has acquired immune deficiency syndrome probably... - No, no... He doesn't have AIDS. I don't want to sound clichéd, but when you indulge in unnatural practices... Look, Thomas. You don't get cancer from anal penetration. I'm talking my car tomorrow. Sorry. When he gives his pupils exams, he's afraid of being late, and he takes the car. Your car! Ah, my mum! She met my dad in Algeria when he was in the army. She followed him. Moving from Algiers to rainy Brittany gave her a thermal shock from which she never recovered. About time! Hello! - All right, Loïc? - Jeanne-Marie, sorry. Hi Loïc. How are you? It's great to see you despite the circumstances. We almost got trampled. They're all crazy here. It's your first time in Paris. I visited Rennes 3 times, and that's plenty. It's beautiful! How's he coping with all the tests? He's very brave, and he's got a lot of support too. How's his girlfriend taking it? Her? Which girlfriend? Er... she's taking it well, and... they're coping... They're coping. God bless you, son. Scaring us like this! - But now I know where you are. - Mum, this is Alfredo. I'm delighted to meet you. - All right? - Me, yes. Hey. It suits you, that blazer, Gwen. It's bursting at the seams though. - Hello, Yann. - Loïc. It's a lovely lion, Alfredo! - Yes! - Can I have it after? Yes. - Excuse me! - Coralie, come in. Mum meet Coralie. Good evening. Hello. Hello, madam! Hello. Gwen, I'm Yann's brother. Sorry, I wasn't expecting this. The thing is I told her you were a real louse. - Sea louse. - Sea louse! Sea louse! Hey! OK. Enough! Doctor. I'm his mum. Hello doctor. - Professor Meyrand. - Meyrand! Sorry, doctor. May I speak to you? I've nothing to tell you. We don't have the results of the evaluation. My patient needs rest. Make sure he gets it! You all heard what the professor said so let's all go home. Off you go! Except you of course! You're right. I'll come back tomorrow. Look after yourself, son. Come on then! See you! Bye! - See you soon. - Yes. Did she understand about Alfredo? Yes. We put her on the right track. Yes. Well, subtly. - Ciao. - Hey girls! Look after him. I know it isn't the same, but he already lost a friend. See you. Miss Deleux? - Yes? - The door. - Thanks, Miss Deleux. - You're welcome. Come on in. Right, this... It's the guestroom, for the boys. It's a futon. Jeanne-Marie. And this is my room. - It's for you. - It's a futon. The telly! Telly! So she's your famous friend Coralie? She's really fit. She's very black, no? Like her by any chance? The only think I like is, the doctor isn't chatty. Get out of the kitchen! I'll make dinner. I'll take Yann some pancakes. Get down. - The telly! - Get down! Fuck! - Loïc, you're a pain! - You're a pain! - Any news? - No. I can't reach him. - Here's the storyboard. - I know it. Excuse me. Kathy Perec, please? Upstairs, in accounts. Thanks. Mum's waiting with Loïc. Any news? We should have the results soon. Hello Gwen. Hello Coralie. I'm taking the afternoon off. I'll be as silent as a giraffe. See you soon. Who's that? Looks like a musician. I'm loving the dungarees and blazer! Is the shoot here? You should've said! - At last! - Don't you have a mobile? No. I prefer you to bother my agent. OK, wardrobe, make-up. Fast! Alert! Arlette allows! Alert... Hands off my hair. I do it myself. Quiet on the set, please. - Lights. - Camera! Dietetikrem, take 1. The boom! Action! Selenium, calcium, sodium, potassium... iron, zinc... Cut! Léo, we can't see your eyes. You know your lines? - Obviously. - Good. Excellent. Let's do it again. Sound. - Once more. Silence. - Camera. Dietetikrem, take 2. And... action! Selenium, calcium, potassium, iron... Cut! You come home for lunch now? Yes. Hello, my little Barbie. How are you? Right... Class 3 B. 3 C. 3 B, 3 A, 3 A. 3 C. 3 A. - Where are the files? - I put them there. I just spent 2 hours sorting Yann's documents for his sickness benefit. Your pa's sick, but life still goes on! Who's that for? My exam papers! You've exams to mark, but you still have to eat! She's crazy. She's completely crazy. Bloody hell! Just look at that! Dietetikrem, take 33. OK, stay really focused. Action! Sodium, calcium, selenium, potassium, copper, carotene, ascorbic acid, riboflavin sodium phosphate. Magnesium trisilicate. Alpha-tocopherol. Zinc, iron. You think that's why I eat it? Not at all. It's because it's... Fuck, it's disgusting. Cut! I don't fucking believe this! It's awful. The first good take! Come with me! Right, now you listen to me. Hang on! Who are you anyway? Romain Pratt. OK, listen, Romain Pratt. I've done more ads than you've done girls. We just asked you to learn your lines and spare us your remarks. How do you expect me to play such a dumb part? I'm an artist. That's the problem! We asked for an actor. Goodbye. Wait! Wait, Romain. Let's go it again. I didn't give it my best shot. Too late. You've fucked up our day. You want to fire me? The biggest mistake in your little career. You jerk! Get out! Keep your flippers, they'll be handy in Cannes! He's adamant. He usually refuses ads. He's an artist. But they offered him so much, he ended up accepting. There he is! Bye, Tara. See you tomorrow. Great shoot, baby. And I've a great surprise. - I'm moving in with you. - Oh yes! And Thomas, still madly in love? He'll come visit as soon as he can, but he's got the PTA meeting so... The parents are such pains! It's Meyrand! Yes, it's Meyrand. Good evening. Good evening, doctor. I need a word with you and your friend. I'm his mum. Speak in front of everyone. Save me repeating. So be it. I'll give you my prognosis. The results... About time too! He's been worried sick for days. Tara Le Bihan, stop that nonsense at once. - Nonsense! Nonsense! - Loïc, please. - Sorry, I didn't mean it. - We know, Tara. - He's a cute lion. - He's sweet. - My son can't die. - Madam, that's why I'm here. - We can determine the appropriate... - Good evening. Dinner. Fried chicken and peas. - How are you, son? - My patient needs quiet. - He has to eat too. - We are quiet, Meyrand. Given the difficult situation in which I find myself... - Be nice to your brother. - I am being nice. But look! We'll discuss the details. We will have to start intensive chemotherapy. Huh? What did you say, doctor? - I bet this is the wrong time. - Yes. My expenses. In case I get fired today... What do you mean? I hired a loser for Dietetikrem. In this business, you can't mess up. That's awful! No need to get into that state for me. Hey, Kathy! It'll be OK. It isn't the end of the world. Sorry, but I had some very bad news recently. I'm all over the place. - Here! - A blank cheque? Kathy. - Why does he want to see us? - No idea. It's us. About time too! You're such a jerk! It's hot in here. Here, hang on. Do you remember our promise? - Yes. - Of course. 1, 2, 3... It's your turn to keep it. I'm going to save you 6 years of analysis. - Tara. - Yes? You're going to leave Thomas. What for? I'm sick of you being unhappy. But I'm not unhappy. Am I, Kathy? You've never liked him. I don't like him because he destroys you. I can't live without him. I'm incapable of living alone. You've always been with jerks but he's a world champ. If you don't, I'll die to piss you off. How can you say that? Thomas is... I love him. I want his child, and he'll be an excellent father. Besides... I'm 33 years old. You're such a masochist. OK, I'll give you a chance. If you marry, you get my blessing. But if he refuses, you dump him, and that's that. Look, Tara. It's brutal, but it can only do you good. - Yann, we'll be going. - Hang on... Don't think you're getting out of this! You, Kathy, it's the opposite. Find yourself a real man. What? That's so mean. Why does she always get the best option? I don't think that's how Kathy sees it. Stop taking freedom for happiness. Why are you so scared of me? A woman doesn't need a Thomas to be happy. What? That's enough! Tara, I'm going to puke. Hand me the bowl. I can't do it. Tara told me there's a guy who's got a crush on you. - He doesn't anymore. - Why? Tell me. I accused him... of sexual harassment. Great idea. Why did you do that? To piss him off. Is he unpleasant? He's nice, it's infuriating. - Is he married? - No. Attractive? Hey, he wouldn't happen to be... Shame! No, I don't care. Your mission, Kathy Perec, is to seduce this man. Or your pal Yann will self-destruct. I don't see the connection! I do. If you sort out your problems, it'll help me fight this. Maybe even get better. So it's irrational, but that's how it is. It was our promise. You don't have any choice. Now get out of here. You're tiring me. Superb. You were like Callas in La Traviata. I've got to try and get tenia. What are you on about. Tapeworm. That way, I'll lose 20 kilos in 3 days, Thomas gets the old me back, marries me, and that's it. For the buffet, avoid salami. Smart aleck! - You promised too. - Yeah, right! I have to act like a whore to satisfy him. He's too much! After what we've done for him. Especially you! It's less crowded today. I see you obeyed Professor Meyrand. There we go! And he's going to good. Huh? Good, nurse. Very good. Excellent. See you later. Son... It didn't hurt too much, did it? I feel woozy. Did you have a hard night? No, thanks to Alfredo. He slept here. Yann couldn't sleep so... It's because the house is empty without me. Do you understand, Mum? Children, what the Church says... isn't necessarily what Our Lord Jesus thought. - If my uncle could hear you. - What's he do? Cardinal at the Vatican. Stop sucking up, you. So he know the Pope intimately? You could say that. And you've met him? Several times, yes. All in white, in his popemobile, he's magnificent. It's ever so moving. Yann darling! - Hello! - Hello. We've been so busy with the new collection... I've brought you some lingerie samples. It's nice here. Do you need anything? A pump-action shotgun maybe. It's beautiful! An Indian headdress. Take that off! We don't know who's worn it. What a lovely family! I won't bother you any longer. I'll come again, darling. Ciao then! Ciao! Take that thing off! Brothers and sisters, to conclude, let us remember these words of hope found in these 2 verses of Psalm 119. "Sustain me, my God, according to your promise, "and I will live; "My comfort in my suffering is this: "Your promise preserves my life." Now let us all sing with joy Long Live the Lord. - Why so loud? - Because I know it. Thomas? Do you want to marry me? Do you want to marry me? Tara, my love, I don't know what to say. Just say yes. Well... yes. Bye-bye, Barbie. When I realized we don't have a dishwasher, I woke up. If he refuses to marry me, I'll pretend to leave him, and everyone will be happy. You can't pretend to Yann! It's easy for you to lecture. Have sex with Romain Pratt. He's right, Yann. You're ridiculous all alone in your spotless flat with your panty collection... You silly cow! You think my life's ridiculous? Look at yours! You prefer to live with a nutter than alone. I find that pathetic! You stuff yourself, you're unhappy! - Yann wants to help you. - Yeah, right! Nothing would give me more pleasure than you dumping Thomas. You're so nasty! Does the jerk still have his brown purse? I'm warning you, I won't let a compulsive and frigid nutter insult me and my guy. You started it, with the panty business! - What are you doing? - Cleaning. It gets so dusty. See, where there's a will, there's a way. Seeing how bad things were, Kathy finally decided to take action. Can I have a word? You may remember, a while ago... you came to see me and I said something that could have made you think... That you took badly. I understand you took it badly because it was... It was very clumsy. What are you talking about? I accused you of sexual harassment. I'd like to apologize... I should never have said that. I'm sorry. Actually, if... If your drink of an offer stands still, I'd love to accept. I'll think about it. Thanks. Yann, I hate you. Tara... - What's going on? - It's Romain. He's mean. I feel so humiliated... I can't face going back to the office! You did it, Kathy! What's that's awful smell? As happiness comes in many forms, Salomé waited till the day before I left hospital to fire me. I love the smell of exhaust! Nice change from disinfectant. A blanket is good if you feel the cold. Take it off! I'm 32, not 92. I never will be either. Chuck out those flowers! This isn't a funeral. - Know what I'd like to do? - What? Get smashed. It's a bit soon. Wait till you're better. You're saying that... Our promise? Where you at? I bought you things you like: quiche, choux buns... I keep telling you everything tastes disgusting! Right. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm doing everything wrong. If you'd done nothing, he'd be annoyed too. He's changed. He isn't my old Yann. He's turned nasty. It's hard for him. - For me too, it's hard. - What about me? Get a move on! I'm ready. Are you sure? - Where were you? - At Yann's. Is that so? "How is he,Tara?" Not very well, but it's sweet of you to ask. When do I get to see you? - Thomas? - What? Why don't we get married? Us marry? Are you preggers? I'd be surprised... You look 3 months pregnant. You're no top model! - That's low. - You know how I feel. It's for your own good. My own good? It's really hurtful. For your welcome. My mum left reassured, I was relieved. The day she caught me aged 13 with a young English boy would be our secret forever. Look after Yann. Will you phone me regularly? You'll end up seeing the boy at your office. God bless you! I expect you all for Christmas, with Yann and his Alfredo. Tara, tell your fiancé we'd have liked to meet him. Maybe he'll come for Christmas. Except if you do what Yann wants. Then we won't see him, which will be great! Are you free Saturday? - Sorry not to be late. - Don't make a habit of it! I hardly recognize you. Have you been a boxing fan long? My dad almost turned pro but became a referee. Tonight, an exceptional evening at the Marcel-Cerdan Sports Palace. - All right? - Yeah. - I didn't think it would be so... - So what? Exciting. But I'm a bit scared. Don't worry. The international referee, Mr. Daniel Talon! It's starting. It must really hurt! The gloves are just so they don't break their fingers. Go on! Still OK? - OK? Are you coping? - Yes. I'm here to report. All right... I spoke to Thomas about getting married. He's thinking about it, but I think it's looking good. Do what you want, I don't care. It's your life not mine. You free to fuck it up. The living don't know what they're missing. Why are you so aggressive? I'm doing my best. Peter and Éric explained. Peter is a shrink. It seems I'm over phase 3: bargaining. Where are you at? Round 4: self-pity. Can't you tell? I'm even watching 2 guys fight. And... will there be a fifth round? Yes. Acceptance, apparently. But I'll be knocked out before. Stop! You'll lose all your friends by being such a pain! I'm not worried about Tara. The blokes abuse her, the tighter she holds on. Look! Look, it's Kathy. Oh my god! She's aged a fair bit. I'd like you to know something. I never sleep on my first date. That's good, because I don't either. Besides, it doesn't matter because this is our 2nd, right? - Haven't you forgotten something? - No. You have. That's right, the amount. - Sorry, I booked a table. - I've nothing in your name. I've one table left. Follow me. I'm so clumsy... That's why I didn't wear a dress. I've got it everywhere, but it's good luck apparently. Sorry. I'll have the guinea fowl. Thanks, Cédric. No. I'm Laurent. Everyone in the biz is here. It's important to be seen. Isn't that so, Max? I can't see anyone. Thierry! Who's that jerk? I stole his part. Thierry Lhermitte, excellent actor. Careful! May I? - Want to know my thoughts? - I don't want to pry. That queer caught something, but you stick to your diet. How dare you talk about my pal like that! Only I'm allowed to. Can't I express my opinions? You'd think he did it on purpose. You're such a macho. That's why you love me. Why are you sobbing? You're crazy, Tara. You should see a shrink. Stop crying! Come to bed. Leave me alone. All right, I'll leave you alone. Here, baby. This is a number 3 special. 8 months' gestation in 14°C water. - Know how to recognize it? - No idea. When you look at the side, it's a bit twisted. I'll get it... Jean-Marc? I've left Anne-Sophie. We can be open about our love. Go to your mum's. - Or your wife's. - I can't! I told her all about us. She made a terrible scene. I saw her for what she is. All those wasted years... I felt the power of our love. - Coralie honey, I need you... - Sir? Sir, I think you're a bit late. What's going on? Are you moving? You're very observant. Who's he? Her husband. Ah, right... All right? Cooee, Yann! I did it! Did what? With Romain, the promise, it's done! Great. Aren't you pleased? I didn't just ask you to screw him. That's easy. I asked you to keep him. I'll believe that when I see it! Open your bottle anyway. No. I'm very tired. I didn't get much sleep. I'm going home. Morning! What's that? No idea. It was in your mail. Come on, open it! What's that? An anti-slip mat for the bath tub. Isn't there a note? No. There are some real weirdoes.. So you don't slip next time! When's the next time? If you pee on it, I'll shave you! What's all this? What are you doing? I'm leaving. I had a really tough day, I have a sore throat, I'm coming down with pharyngitis, I don't want a discussion. You don't get it. There's nothing to discuss. I'm leaving you. Now. Why? I've been unhappy for ages. I'll die if I stay. Tell the truth for once. You've met someone? Not even. I bet it's Kathy's doing. She hates you having a bloke. You're so wrong. Where are you going? None of your business. Can't we talk? - We already have. - When? When I suggested we get married. I didn't think you were serious. Well, I was. Tara, I can't bear you leaving. It's awful. Don't do what my mum did. Don't abandon me, darling. I need you. Don't leave me, darling... You didn't want the seafood? I hate 2 things: seafood and llamas. We've a billon fascinating things to tell each other. Kathy... The "bath mat" operation is off. Hi. Us It's an illusion that's dying From a burst of laughter in the heart A meaningless affair As so many are - Hey. - Hi. How was your evening? Awful. And the guy looked like Elephant Man. When I shut my eyes, I saw Thomas. Wasn't much of a change then. Hey! You've never seen him. Those are my pajamas. You've shed weight. It's always the same, you know. You get hitched, eat, put on weight, then you split up, get depressed, lose weight and it all start again. I wouldn't call him. Makes you look desperate. He may have been mean, pretentious, macho and all, but when a limb is amputated, it still hurts you. There's one thing I'm sure about: he didn't deserve you. And I deserve this crappy song? It was our slow dance. You wouldn't get it. The door! She's at the end of her tether! But she's a big girl, isn't she? Get a babysitter for her tonight. We're staying out. Yann, you can't imagine how hard it was to find. Here you go! - A tetrahydrocannabinol plant. - Thanks, Tara. It's the only thing that works. Gracias, danke schön, shukran... I feel sick all the time. It's so boring! Let's dry a bit in the oven right now. Ma che bella! I'll take good care of it. I've got green fingers. Give it here. What are you doing tonight? Going to Peter's divorce. Want to come? I don't think so. I've got something on. Thanks. I'm tired of hearing them groan like rutting deer. Thanks, Tara. For everything. No. It's for me to thank you. Selenium, potassium, carotene, copper, ascorbic acid, riboflavin sodium phosphate, magnesium trisilicate, alpha-tocopherol, zinc, iron... And you think that's why I eat it? It's such a dumb ad! Is your friend pretty too? I've got the perfect technique. If you want to screw her, tell her you really respect her. Works every time. Well, for me, it does. - You disgust me. You're so cynical. - Can we go now? You obviously like pistachios. But I prefer crisps. Léo! Let's go! They took it really badly. Especially Peter. Good! The time I've wasted seeing jerks and doing totally futile stuff... I swear all that's going to change. You have to call your solicitor. Your dossier for ombudsman is rock solid. He's going to chop off Salomé's head. I won't call him. The sage said, "Sit on the river bank, "and you'll see the corpse of your enemy float by." With a zebra print g-string. And a feather in her ass! Idiot! Forget it. Everything matches, even your handbag. I love the Latino vibe, me. It doesn't matter. Be right back. Yeah, right! One for the mum, one for the daughter! Next time I see you, I'll bust your kneecaps. - Haven't we already met? - No, I don't think so. - Let's go. It's boring here. - The service sucks! What's up with your nose? I got the door in my face in the loo. Right, let's go. Really nice. Kathy? - Romain? - Yes? Did you and Nadège have a fling? It's ancient history. Did it last long? No! Just one night. I make mistakes now and then. She'd be thrilled to hear she's a mistake. The mistake was getting involved. You said, "one night". Yes, one night. Just one night. Must have been some night! Please don't be like that. We weren't together at the time. It was just after your allusion to sexual harassment. I knew it. I thought you couldn't care less about me. So you sought comfort in another's arms. Typical guy! It may not be an excuse, but I was really demoralized. And drunk. - Why didn't you tell me? - What was the point? If I'd told you, you'd have been mad. As I said nothing... We were in the area. It'd be nice if we had a drink together. Okay. I should've known. We're disturbing you. Right... Annie, my colleague. This is Max. And her boyfriend. Haven't we met? Yes. Hi. What's your name? I'm crap with names. Kathy. Yes, of course! Obviously. Life is a mille-feuille, we're all on the same layer. Right. I'm going to chill. Kathy, Kathy... Kathy...? In Lorient. - How long ago? 7 years? - Almost. 13 years, next month. Say, you keep a record of things. Only wise for a head accountant. I haven't greeted my great pal, the famous adman Romain Pratt. Is that it? Seems like it's a night for reunions. Sorry, I've forgotten your name. And are you...? - Are you what? - Are you together? None of your business! Don't tell me you're married. I'm not married. All isn't lost then. I'd love to drink to the good old days. Maybe we should go. Annie? Léo? Yes, let's go. Huh, Léo? Léo? I'll be back. Goodbye. See you Monday. Thanks for tonight. Bye, Mr. Adman. Sorry, I've never met the guy before. I know him. I fired him from the shoot. Didn't you meet him that night? No, and it's a shame. I'll be going then. If you need me, I'll be in the bathroom. Léo Melvil... He dreamt of being a star. He failed. How do you know him? I'd like you to leave. - Because of Nadège or him? - Just leave! Bye. - The way you looked at her! - Stop! She was 17 and mad about me. It's no big deal. It is too. You don't love me. You're such a flirt. Listen! Stop! Baby, I adore you. And you know it. And the Cuban girl in the bar, did you meet her at 17? Answer me! I'm sick of your goddamn moaning! Loser! Annie, wait! I'm here for you. You met him on the accounting course in Lorient, eh? Yes. I spent my evenings at the theatre watching him. I was crazy about him. Me and Yann figured something was going on. As you said nothing... Besides, you never say anything. Why did you kick Romain out? He can go fuck himself. He slept with a girl from the agency. I don't believe it! The swine! He seems mad about you. - Yes... - Oh, men! Since you've been together? Actually, not really. It happened before. What? Are you nuts? You kicked him out for sleeping with her before you met? Tara... I'm going crazy. It's a good job Yann doesn't know, he'd have a relapse. It's Romain. Look, try to make up for it. I told you I'd be back. I always keep my word. He didn't look too happy out in the street. Why did you come back? Life is amazing. Us meeting again is a sign. It's no coincidence. - Come sit next to me. - No. Come on... Kathy... You're so beautiful. It's really moving to see you again. You remember I was pregnant? Really? Are you sure? It's so long ago... Remember? You said you'd come back. And you never called. I was married. You expected too much from me. Did you keep it? No. You did right. It'd have fucked up your life. Legal abortion... Thanks, Simone Veil. - It really liberated us. - Yes. It's like dishwashers. Abortions are commonplace now... but it's still traumatic. Especially when it goes badly. You're stronger than we are. It's true. We can learnt a lot. - And how's your wife? - Viviane? We divorced years ago. She couldn't handle my fame, my career in Canada, all that... You're gorgeous. You know what? This will sound dumb, but I've just realized a crazy thing. You're the only woman I ever loved. I swear. After you, I never said, "I love you." And Annie? Annie? I only met her tonight. She's dating Max. Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom. What a liar! What a bastard! I loved him so much... I want to die. Stop. Think of Yann. Thanks to him, our life has changed. Yes, for the worse! Look, you're 30 and you've got 5 minutes to throw him out. Or I'll burn down your bathroom! Check me out! I haven't put on a pound in 13 years. I don't believe it! Ah, my dream... I'm so lucky! It's fabulous to see you again. The same. In a g-string... What are you doing? You'll mess up my jacket. You messed up my life! You ain't screwing me again. Hang on, Kathy. Where are you going? We were going to have fun. Hey, Kathy... I don't get it. Calm down, please! Not my clothes! And now get out! - I wasn't to know. - See you, jerk! Romain? The door was open, I came up. Romain, please... Forgive me. A billion times over. I hate Christmas but that year, I was thrilled to see my island. I brought my mum a great gift: me in good health. If you get lonely at home, you can stay with us. Yes, but without your record. For pity's sake! I don't feel lonely, I feel free. I'm snowed under. Are you taking care of Tara's collection? You bet! Clothes for fat ladies, I find that so exciting. I mean it! I was sick of those anorexic girls. And he's got all Salomé's contacts. - What does Meyrand say? - He thinks I'll survive Christmas. Stop! Be serious. The most recent tests are good. The doctor's hopeful. Hopeful or not, the long-term prognosis is, I'm going to die. You idiots, we'll all die one day! Let's celebrate! - Champagne? - Champagne! Party time! You hit a seagull! - He means business. - Wait, there's a bottleneck. What shall we drink to? To Thomas and his little brown purse? No. To Léo Melvil and his amazing career. No. To Kathy who floored me. To my pal Yann! Who fucked up our life! Hey! No... to life! To life! To my mom... Subtitles : Eclair Group
