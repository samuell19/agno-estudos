Behind The Screen was Chaplin's seventh film for Mutual. It descends from two of his Keystone comedies. A Film Johnny and The Property Man, but at the same time burlesques the Mack Sennet school of knock- about which Chaplin had left exactly two years before this film was released on November 13, 1916. BEHIND THE SCREEN "Can I be an actress, please?" "Goliath, the stage-hand. David, his assistant." "Prepare the scene!" "Loafing again?" Later. The scene dressed. Finishing touches. "Look! At it again!" Stage-hands' lunch hour. "How dare you wake us up? We strike!" "We've struck! Are you with us?" "Do you need a stage-hand, sir?" "When I fire this gun -- you pull the traps!" "Oh! Mercy!" "Boy, sew this!" The dramatic department. The comedy department. Rehearsing a new idea. "I don't like this high-brow stuff!" The strikers plan revenge. GIANT POWDER DYNAMITE "Can you act?" "He ducks and you get it!" THE END - .:: ENGsub by Korf (UIN#104538656) ::.
