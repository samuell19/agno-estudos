Everybody has to get out of here, now! Watch your back! Funny thing about a dream: when you're asleep, no matter what happens, no matter how crazy it might be, it all seems to make sense. I was there when millions of people vanished off the face of the earth. But I didn't wake up. I cheered as the world came together in the name of peace, as race, politics and religion no longer mattered. I should have known it was too good to be true. And maybe it was. And when one single man rose to power to rule the entire world, I watched it all happen. I helped him get there. That's when the dream turned into a nightmare. And like that instant in a dream when you fall, that's when I should have sat bolt upright in my bed. But I didn't. I can only hope... that I'm not trapped here forever... that I'm not already dead, spending an eternity in hell... and I can only pray... that God decides to wake me soon. Fast. Come on. Let's move it. Now. Come on. Grab those things. Now. Where are these Bibles going? Utah. That truck! Come on. Move it out. Back it in. Keep it moving. They're here! Bail! Bail! Run! Run! Let's go! Where's Chris? He's coming. Call for backup! You're under arrest! Bruce, we can't leave him. We gotta get these Bibles out of here. We can't leave him! Guess you know I can execute you right now, if I want to. So who do you work for? The... Son... of... Man. Last chance. Who do you work for? God Almighty. Wrong answer. Those aren't pigeons you're shooting, are they? Nope. Pull! I was thinking about those terror attacks on the GC buildings, those missing weapons, and those few people who, for some reason, can't stand the idea of peace. Pull! And I'm thinking about the militia's intelligence that seems to be getting more and more powerful. And about that conversation we had just last week about how vulnerable we'd be if we got rid of too many of our weapons. Pull! What are you saying? The militia knew exactly where those missiles were, and, my guess, they had the codes as well. What do you think about that, John? Look around you. They're not even looking at us. Why would they? You're my vice president, my best friend, loyal. You could shoot me before they even knew what happened. I'm fighting for America, not against it. And you should be too. America is the will of its people. And, just like the rest of the world, it's a new way. They've chosen a single man. When those people disappeared, it changed everything. They looked at the bigger picture. Politics, religion, race, it didn't matter. That's when Nicolae stepped in. And America stepped out. There are 172 countries in this world, and all 172 voted to drop their weapons in the name of peace. It's a new way, and I'm happy to be part of it. Oh, you were a part of it. Nicolae is planning to attack America, and I can prove it. Uh... these transmissions that you say you intercepted. What did they say, exactly? Well, they were coded, so it's impossible to know exactly what they said, but... we did pick up certain scientific references. Chemical formulas. Formulas? What kind of formulas? Biological. The kind that can wipe out an entire country in a matter of days. Uh... What else? There are about 200 people with the kind of technical expertise to pull off that kind of biological warfare. Half of them have been assigned to projects that don't even exist. Look, you say we're close friends, right? Yeah. Why did you not come to me with this in the first place? I was about to. Just for argument's sake, let's just say that the GC is developing biological weapons. What makes you think that the United States is one of its prime targets? Go! Go! Hey, what are you doing? Hey, where are you going? Call in air! John! Come on. Are you okay, sir? Who are you? Mallory was a good man, a man you could trust. Know that. Love is patient. Love is kind. It's not jealous, or boastful, arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way. Love is not irritable or resentful. It does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices at right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. So faith, hope and love abide, these three. But the greatest of these... is love. Um, Buck? Buck. Oh. Yeah. Thanks. From the moment I met you, I knew I had never known love before. Chloe Steele, I love you, and I choose you to be my wife. To live with you, to make you laugh, to stand by your side... and to sleep in your arms... to be joy for your heart... and, with God's help, comfort for your soul. You helped lead me to the most important truth, and I'm eternally grateful to you. And now... I'm eternally yours. Forever one. Whooh. Knew I should have gone first. Cameron Williams... Buck... I thought you'd never ask. I was a silly girl with a big dream... and a really big crush. To be yours and yours alone... to laugh with you in good times, support you in bad... to comfort you with my body... and mirror you with my soul... to share everything with you. And now my dream has come true, and I shall be yours for as long as we both shall live. From now until eternity. I'm being upstaged by my own daughter. I met you at the beginning of my new life when I was prepared for... hardship, sacrifice, the end of the world, anything. But not for you. Amanda Susan White, I wasn't prepared for the way that you make me smile, the way you make me feel, the way you make me a better man. You are a blessing for a life that does not deserve it. And I promise God that I will love you today, and for the rest of my life. Captain Rayford Steele... you're not the man I ever thought I'd marry. Gee, thanks. Too good-looking. Too confident, too successful. Too tall. But then I saw that you were determined to be the man and the father... the leader that God had chosen you to be. And suddenly, I felt chosen to be your helper, your mate, your friend... and your wife. Rayford, you are the man I will marry. God is glorious. And I promise to thank him for you for the rest of my life. And with that, it gives me immense pleasure and joy to pronounce you... Buck and Chloe... Ray and Amanda... in the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior, man and wife. You may kiss your brides. So, Ray, where does Nicolae have you flying to? Well, the rumor is New Babylon, but it changes daily. A honeymoon in New Babylon. I hear Iraq's beautiful this time of year. And how about you guys? Oh, I don't know. I'm sure we'll find something to do. Oh, boy. RAY: Hey. And you, our fearless leader? Go see Chris's family and go about the Father's business. I suppose you'll be joining him. Dad, we've been over this. We feel called to take back and share these Bibles, Ray. I spent most of my life pretending to serve God. I'm through pretending. Yeah, I know, see, but you're talking to the father and the husband of a young girl that almost got shot yesterday. Look, I... I know. I... I know. But some security guard a GC trooper, or Nicolae himself will not choose when our journey is over. God will decide. We'll be safe in the palm of his hand, in the center of his will. Like Chris was? Yes. "Vice President Mallory has been assassinated. President Fitzhugh is hurt, but still alive." Oh, my... I've got to get to Washington. Wait. Let's pray. All right. Father, if we do nothing but admit to knowing you and loving you... they send us for reeducation. If we lift a finger to spread your word, they sentence us as terrorists. Even if we make it to court, it is a dark and fearful world, yet we are reminded of your word. Yea, though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we will fear no evil, for you are with us. Your rod and your staff will comfort us. For you've prepared a table before us in the presence of our enemies. Amen. Mr. President. Yes. All intel points to the militia. You're sure? What about the bodies? Nothing, sir. Clean. We're running their prints and DNA. And those two motorcyclists, anything yet? Nothing, sir. What is it? Nicolae's office called, sir. He wants to see you. Mr. President. You're tough, Gerald. Thank the gods. I'm sorry about the vice president. I know he was a friend. Despite all this, we must stay the course. The militia think I'm Big Brother. The Christians think I'm Satan. It won't change any of their minds by acts of good or kindness. They'll all think it's part of the game. Look at the global community we formed. Think of what we've achieved. It was unthinkable. Look at the sky, Mr. President. Tell me something. What color do you see? Blue. Maybe what I see is what you'd call green. There is no real way of knowing, is there? I guess not. It's that little grain of mustard seed. That's what dissenters do, Gerald. They sow seeds of doubt. Militia does it out of a sense of fear, out of an inability to trust. Christians... Well, they tell you what kind of faith they want: blind. It only takes a little bit of doubt to cloud our entire dream. For the good of all mankind we must stop this from happening. Steve Plank to see you, sir. Very well. Five minutes. Have Ms. Miller come in to show the president out. Yes, sir. You're a good man, Gerald. I am grateful to call you a friend. Mr. President, my assistant, Ms. Miller. Hello. Hello. I was so sorry to hear about Vice President Mallory. He was a good man, a man you could trust. Something wrong, Gerald? Oh, uh, no, sir. Actually, Ms. Miller and I met at a function a few years ago. I'm very flattered you remembered me, Mr. President. How could I forget? Hey! Hey! Have a seat. Who do you work for? My guess is you already know that. Indulge me. Global Community Weekly. And who do you answer to? Nicolae Carpathia. That's a Bible. Your Bible, Mr. Williams. You know how the GC frowns on hate literature. I've been doing research. I'm sure you have. You have two options. Option number one: You give me all the right answers to my questions, and I'll think about not putting a bullet into your head. Option two... Option one is fine. Are you one of them? Christians? I haven't done anything... I will decide that myself. Now, do you renounce the name of Jesus Christ? Yes or no? No. No, I don't. Heh. Somehow, I don't think Nicolae would be thrilled with that answer. Mr. President. Desperate times. It's a matter of trust, Mr. Williams. I'm a Christian. What's next? I was told that somebody was planning an all-out biological attack on this country. Does that sound familiar? Then I asked myself, "If I was a terrorist "and I wanted to kill millions of people with biological weapons, what would I do?" What would a nice Christian like yourself be doing stockpiling all the vaccines you can get your hands on? Ah-ah! Answers now, prayers later. The answer is in there. Matthew, chapter 24, verse 3. "And as he sat upon the Mount of Olives, "the disciples came to him privately, saying, 'Tell us, when shall these things be, And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?' And Jesus answered and said unto them..." Read that. Pestilences? That it? Not, uh, tornado, or earthquake? That's in there too, but there's no vaccines for those. Webster defines pestilence as a serious infectious disease that spreads rapidly and kills large groups of people. So in a word, yes. And before you write it off as paranoia, read the next verse. "Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, "and shall kill you, "and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake." "You"... "You" meaning Christians, right? Fits pretty well, doesn't it? For his name's sake, you almost put a bullet in my head about five minutes ago. All right... what about the militia? They have their own reasons for going after Nicolae. Has nothing to do with us. Except you both hate Nicolae. We know who he is. The Bible refers to him as the beast of Revelation. He's the Antichrist. Wouldn't you all want him dead? He's the Antichrist. You can't kill him. Here in the real world... what are your sources telling you? Nicolae has put together a powerful group of scientists from dozens of different fields. Biologists, chemists... from all over the world. We don't know why, or what he's meeting with them about, but whatever they're talking about, it's happening right here in the United States. Where? I don't know. Is that it? That's it. All right, you're free to go. We'll be in touch with you. Good luck with those earthquakes. Dave, extension 52. Dave, extension 52. Hattie. Hi, Ray. I heard you were here. I figured you'd never get around to introducing me to your lovely new wife. So I took it upon myself. I was just giving Mandy my congratulations. And giving her a few pointers about you. Hattie. AMANDA: It's okay. Considering the circumstances, Hattie has been very gracious. Women don't heal as quickly as men do. That's very sweet, Mandy, but I think I've healed very well in the arms of Nicolae. But I hope we can be friends, despite Ray's and my... past. Of course. I'd like that. You seem delightful, Mandy. I hope it works out. Hattie... I hope it works out for you too. Just listen to your heart, okay? I always do. Hello. Hi, Buck. You got a minute? Yeah, two minutes. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, what's up? Something's going on. Some sort of outbreak. A lot of people are getting sick. What are the doctors saying? We've got 18 cases here in Chicago. All members of the underground churches. Hopefully it's confined to there. Except it's happening at a dozen of our sister churches across the country. You think somebody's carrying it in? Must be. You know what that means. Everyone new face could be a killer sent by Nicolae. Carrying a pocketful of anthrax. Yeah, and they know we'll never close our doors. We need the vaccines. Maybe those will work. Send somebody for them, and get Chloe out of there. Can I see some ID? Yes? Thank you. Ah! Ms. Miller. Please forgive meeting here. Work never ends. I could think of a lot worse places, sir. Thank you. I have to tell you, you look much better without that MP5. Okay. That day, how'd you know? We had a tip. Unfortunately, the tip didn't come soon enough to save John. Hm. What'd you find? It turns out that Buck Williams is right. Most of the bioscientists that we're now trying to track are, in fact, here in the United States. It's a big country. I realize that, and we don't know exactly where they are yet, but what we do know is that the traffic on the secure lines into the GC Headquarters has increased immensely in the last 48 hours. Have you been able to crack any codes, or intercept any transmissions? No, not yet, sir, but we have been able to track most of the communications back to a power plant just a few klicks outside of Washington. So, what do you think? I think that we should go and look at it. Tonight. I know you need proof, sir. John did try and tell you, and moments later, they killed him. Okay. Go ahead. So... tell me, Ms. Miller, are you married? It's Carolyn. Hm. Yes, I was married. My husband died a few days after the vanishings. I'm sorry. He was a journalist. He was working on a big story, and, apparently, he stuck a nerve somewhere along the line. What happened? Eric called and told me that he had uncovered a huge story, a front-page story, and he told me he was scared, and I didn't ever see him again. And they told me that he... That he fell off the Staten Island Ferry. So I got in touch with John for his help. John never told me. I think at first he was just doing a favor for the widow of an old friend, but I got him all the e-mails, all of Eric's notes that I could find, and he had trouble fitting the pieces together until Nicolae started confiscating all the weapons. Uh-huh. And that's why he got you a job on Nicolae's staff. Mm-hm. And into the militia. I don't like this idea, and your dad won't either. You're supposed to love and obey. Yeah. These vaccines weigh a ton. You know, we should be packing for our honeymoon like normal people. Maybe I should come with you. No, you need to stay here. I'm really proud of you, you know that? Yeah. I'm just doing what I'm called to do. We all are. The next person that shakes your hand could be the... Don't think like that. We really need to keep our faith in times like these. Sometimes it's all that we have. Isn't this the point where you're supposed to tell me that everything's going to be okay? Hey, of course it will. Remember what Bruce told us on our wedding? We can't die until God says it's time. Right. That was so romantic. We'll get in there, sir. Come on. Bibles. Come on. This way! Room 21, westbound corridor, section three. We got 'em! That way. We're on our way. Let's go, move it. What have I done? You didn't know. I helped him become a global Hitler. What makes me any different? You know, my... My father, he died during the California primaries. He never did see me become president, but I have no doubt that he died believing it. I'm sure he was very proud of you. You know the last thing he told me? He said, "Gerry, you will change the world." He squeezed my hand, and he smiled... and he died. Hm. I guess he was right. I changed the world, all right. Hey, Ray. Huh? Ooh, aren't we jumpy. So... you married Ms. Goody Two-Shoes. Did you know she has a Bible stashed in your suite? That's okay. I didn't report it. I mean, we both know what would happen if I did. Don't worry. I can keep a secret... if I want to. You know, I've never even hinted to Nicolae that you're a Christian. Never even told him that you and I almost... Do you know why I didn't tell him, Ray? Because... maybe I still love you. And maybe you still love me. Please, no. Don't say no. You loved me once Ray, at least admit that. Do you remember our layover in Rome? You told me you loved me. But you were married, and you hesitated because your marriage was too important. And then she was gone, and then God was too important. And now you have a new woman. Please, Hattie. Come on. Stop. Why don't you admit it Ray? Why won't you admit you want me? You always have, even now. What about Nicolae? Nicolae has many lovers. We have an understanding. Listen, you have made some bad decisions, okay? If you would just see the truth... Jesus? Please, come on, Ray. Ray. Ray, just kiss me. Come on. Just kiss me once. Tell me you don't love me. I don't love you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. For you and Amanda. I just need a minute, just a minute. Oh! I'm so cold and so hot. Do you want some water? Shh. Just keep your eyes closed, you'll feel better. Where'd everyone go? Where is everyone? They all left. They trusted in God to save them, but he's no longer here. No. No, you... You're lying. Am I? Look at you. Did God take your pain away? Why did he leave you here? Please... help me. Okay. Here. Drink this. That's it. There ya go. What's wrong? Just trust me. You? Ah. You know who I am. We used to be good friends. Aah! Pastor! Are you all right? It's okay, Bruce, it's okay. It's okay. Just get some rest. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. Did John do this? He knew we'd need it. Mr. President, this is Major Kent. Major. Welcome onboard, sir. Other than this, what else you got? The British, the Egyptians, Prime Minister Walsh, President Pasha have all been briefed. They're online now, sir. Is it secure? Have you ever intercepted any of our transmissions, sir? Question is, did Nicolae? Prime Minister Walsh, President Pasha, it's been confirmed that Nicolae has created biological weapons. Now, with due respect Mr. President, our sources indicate that Nicolae intends to hit America... with the tactical weapons he was supposed to be destroying. Take a look. Where'd you get this? Global satellite. We broke the code two hours ago. Time frame? Days. Then we'd better act now, within 24 hours. Surprise is our only chance. This way, sir. What about weapons? New York, Chicago, Washington. Yes, sir. Same three cities. Hey. Come on in. You know where your wife is? She's where she wants to be, Ray. You said you'd look after her. Ray, I said, I would support her, and she took the vaccines back to the shelter. That's what she wanted. You know her, Ray. By herself? With the sick and the dying, is that your idea of taking care of her? What? When? Chloe is fine, Buck. How bad is it? Bruce is sick. No telling how many more. The other churches have reported in, it's the same thing. Nothing's stopping it. Well, we gotta get there. Just hold on. Ray, come on, get out of the way. Buck, Chloe sent us here. She knew you'd want to come, but you can't do anything there. She's my wife, and Bruce is my friend. I'm going. Maybe you can find a vaccine or a cure. They're where they are because they're committed to God's will. What's he asking you to do? Let's ask him. Heavenly Father, we need your guidance. Chloe. Buck? This is Fitz. Just called to tell you that you were right. Nicolae has infected Bibles with some new kind of virus. What? But there's more. He's going to attack America. And we're going to try and stop him. I'd stay out of the big cities if I were you. Look, you cannot stop this guy with weapons. Now, what about the virus? I don't know any more. Good luck, Buck. It's in the Bibles. Gotta get back to the White House. But to do what? See if I can smoke him out. In less than an hour, the SAS is gonna launch an attack on that factory. I'll be by. I do not want to lose another good friend. Thanks. Sir? I think your father would be very proud. You may not have seen through Nicolae's lies, but you've done what you thought was right, all the way along. I just hope I'm not too late. Bruce. I just spoke to Buck. He found the source of the virus. Oh, thank you, Jesus. You can... You can stop it? We can stop the spread. What is it? What is it you're not telling me? Bruce, it was the Bibles. Nicolae poisoned the Bibles and then he let us take them. It was given unto him to make war with the saints and overcome them. What are you saying? That it was my doing. That it was my doing. No. No! What you did is you put the word of the Lord in front of millions of souls, and what does he promise? What does he promise?! Bruce. That his word will not return unto him void. That he will achieve that which he... here was... set to accomplish. And that was your doing. And ours. They're already making calls. We did reach many souls. It's okay. ♪ When we all... ♪ ♪ Get to heaven ♪ ♪ What a day of rejoicing It will be ♪ ♪ When we all get to heaven ♪ ♪ We'll sing and shout victory ♪ ♪ When he takes ♪ ♪ Takes ♪ ♪ Me by the hand ♪ ♪ Me by the hand ♪ ♪ And leads me to The Promised Land ♪ ♪ What a day What a glorious day ♪ ♪ What a glorious day ♪ ♪ That will be ♪ And thank you Lord for the guidance, which we know you will show our brother, Buck. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Mm. Without faith, it's impossible to please him. It's okay. For those who come to God, you must believe that he is. And that he is the rewarder of those who diligently seek him. I do believe. Behold. The father of faithfulness. Abraham. Abra... Abraham. The Lord asked Abraham to sacrifice his own son, and because Abraham put it all in God's hand, it was accounted unto him for righteousness. What are you saying? Stan... Stan... The great heroes of faith, what do they all have in common? Did they all get rewards? No. Thousands were killed, burned at the stake, crucified as our Lord. Did they all suffer? No. Countless received the greatest miracles imagined as they crossed through the Red Sea, stopped the mouths of lions, walked through the fiery furnace. So, what do they all have in common? Stand still. They gave it all over. They put their own ways behind them. They that wait upon the Lord will renew their strengths and mount up with wings as eagles. They shall run, and not be weary. They shall walk, and not faint. Stand still. Stand still. And wait upon the Lord. And wait upon the Lord. What? I have to stay. Take care of our girl, Ray. Janice to the office, please. Janice, come to the office, please. Plane's all set. We're ready to go. Okay. I didn't know Nicolae had a flight out this morning. He doesn't. No? Then where are you going? Chicago. Some of my friends are sick, my daughter needs me. That's too bad, Ray. You have responsibilities here. Listen, I've already lost one child, I'm not... We all have problems, Ray. And I'm tired of listening, and dealing with yours. Hattie, please. Come with us. We can help each other. I can't. You wouldn't understand. I think I do. How far along now? Three months. You're pregnant. Does Nicolae know? I don't think so. Then you can come with us. We can take care of you. Hattie, come with us. We can protect you. You can't protect me. You don't know Nicolae. He would never let me go. That is why you have to come with us. I can't. My life is here. I was gonna turn you in, Ray. Hattie... Don't say anything. Just leave before I change my mind. Here. This is mine. You look tired. Rough night? It was great, thank you. And Ms. Miller? How is she? Very well. Yet in the middle of your steamy reunion, you took the time to order a raid. Well, I got a tip about a warehouse being a militia hideout, possibly storing weapons of mass destruction. And was it? Oh, not at all. That's not to say that it wasn't before, but, uh, I think their intelligence was a little bit more sophisticated than I thought. Or yours less. I understand that the agents were not the first ones there. Well, I, uh... I wanted a small unit, just in case the tip was a little, uh, unreliable. You look different today, Gerald. There's something new in your eyes. I see things, you know. President Fitzhugh, excellent. Mr. President. The major can show you our plans. We can move on his power structure in New Babylon from Egypt. Tactical strikes first, followed by a quick ground push. British troops will surround and launch on Heathrow, which is the hub of his airpower. We're ready to move on his primary U.S. strongholds. It's a mistake. Why? Do we have a choice? Now, you said yourself that it was our only chance to surprise him. That may be so. But we've got to take Nicolae out. Now, if we kill him... we've avoided world war. If we don't, Nicolae will take out anyone and everyone in his path. Exactly, that's why we can't afford to take a chance... We have got to have a contingency. Now, if Nicolae isn't dead by 2200 hours, then we strike. What do you have in mind? I haven't been searched yet. This is porcelain. You can't do it. I'm the only one who can. This is one of our newest transponders. Communicates with three different satellites. Once activated, a missile could be there in under a minute. Long enough for you to get out? I hope so. Mr. President, you're expected. Should've gone with him. Helped him. Gerald. Right on time. You played me. I was your right hand. Don't flatter yourself. You'd be surprised who my right hand really is. I know about the virus. You're going to attack America. Of course you do. Do you really think I didn't know about John, or Carolyn? Or that little adventure? So, what now? Expose me? Are you going to activate your little transponder? Starting to panic yet? I don't need a missile to stop you. Just one thing before you shoot me. World War III has begun. Anti-Global Community forces have launched an all-out attack... In the U.S., heavy fighting is taking place across the country, and there are now unconfirmed reports of militia nuclear strikes. New York, Chicago and Washington, are all under fire at this time, as GC forces engage with militia terrorists. Reports of heavy, widespread damage and casualties continue to come in. GC ground, air, and marine forces have now shut down all ways in and out of every major city. We have no confirmation or non-tactical weapons being deployed, but from the extensive damage and casualties, it appears some weapons of mass destruction have been used. Those opposed to world peace and Nicolae Carpathia's whole community have attacked us all tonight. God, don't just leave me here. There are leaders involved at top levels. Prime Minister Tom Walsh of Britain, President Abbas Pasha of Egypt, and even U.S. President Gerald Fitzhugh have all been identified. Warrants for their arrest... Beyond us, who else knew? Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. Thank you, Gerald. Thank you for giving the world every reason to believe in me, and hate all those who stand in my way. What do you think, Mr. President? Is it empty? Why don't you put it away before you get hurt. It was nice of you to drop in for a visit. Now... time to leave. Welcome to my world, Mr. President. That's not humanly possible. Is it? We've been attacked on every front! Before even firing a single shot! Either he was broken or turned, but it had to be him! It's over. We have to surrender. No, we can't, sir! We regroup our forces for a counterattack. How? The GC isn't occupying just one city or even one country. It is occupying the entire world. Then we strike wherever we can, guerilla-style. We cannot let him win. Strike with what? We have nothing left to fight with! What if Fitz got him? Get it through your head. Fitzhugh betrayed us. He didn't. Mr. President. Nicolae plays like a puppet. He wanted war and we... We gave it to him. How did we do that? He knew everything about us. I don't know how he did it all. The truck was his. He betrayed us. We all will be dead soon. What happened? Did you kill him? No, no, he... He was expecting me. He knew all about the transponder. His attacks had already begun. He just switched on the news and then smiled. And...? I... I had him, I... had him. I shot him point blank. He just stood there. I emptied a full clip, three feet away. And he just stood there. You missed? I could hardly miss at this close range. Chloe? Buck. Oh, baby, are you okay? How you doin'? How's Bruce? He's going home, Buck. It's a matter of minutes now. Buck, I love you so much. Oh, baby, I'm so sorry. I-I-I was wrong, I... I should be there with you. No, you're doing God's will. No, I'm sitting here in my apartment watching World War III through a window, and you're a million miles away. Buck, it... It's got me too. What? Baby? Baby, listen to me. You're gonna be just fine. I just need to be there with you. Don't... Don't, Buck. I love you. Chloe? Hey, I got you. Buck. Chloe? Chloe! Hey! Somebody! Help me! Oh, this is not the God I know. Come on, come on. Three feet away, and you not only missed, you also somehow miraculously managed to escape? No one tried to stop you after you unloaded a gun at Nicolae? I was thrown out of a window. Out his office window? Yes, yes, I know. This is ridiculous! If I was there, I'd shoot you myself. Ms. Miller... if there is such a thing as God... may he watch over you. What? You're not going to shoot me, are you? How...? How could you? How could you set us all up? Do you really believe that? You want me to believe that Nicolae magically knew every move we were gonna make. That he's bulletproof, and you fell out a window and walked away? Sir. It was the truth. Why did you let this happen, God? What did I do? Tell me! Is this some kind of game? Is this some kind of test? Why?! Why are you doing this to me? To Chloe? What if I just go to Chicago right now. What are you gonna do? Kill me? How could you? How could you set us all up? How could you set us all up? How could you? He was a good man. How could you betray everybody? John! Come on. That's what you want me to believe? My God. Please help me. The extent of the damage, but estimates are in the millions. Possibly hundreds of thousands dead... Bruce. Hey. I'm glad to see you here. You must be strong, Ray. I'm here for you, Bruce. Not me. Where is she? Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. I told you to leave. I told you. Why didn't you listen? My brother, I'm so sorry. She wanted to do God's will. Just like you. Just like me. God understands your pain, Ray. Your faith is stronger than you think. You will do... You will do great things in his name. Now... I can only hope that I'm not trapped here forever, that I'm not already dead, spending an eternity in hell... and I can only pray... that God decides to wake me soon. Mr. President. Buck. Whether it was you and the militia or someone else... this day was coming. I've failed an entire nation. What are you doing here? I told you on the phone. I-I feel that God wants me here. Don't you have any other place to go? That virus. It got my best friend, and my wife. They're dying. So why are you here with me? Chloe and Bruce... are Christians. And they are going to a better place. But Mr. President, at the moment, you're not. Please listen to me. You've sinned against God, like I have. He calls us to love and obey him in everything we do. What we do in front of people, what we do in secret. Even down to what we think. And he will hold us accountable. Mr. President, look. Time is running out. And I don't want you to go to hell. I've got a feeling it's a little too late for that. God loves you. Two thousand years ago, he proved that. God became a man, Jesus Christ, and he suffered and died on the cross to save you. He literally died to take your punishment, and my punishment, upon himself so that we could be forgiven and set free. Mr. President. When Jesus rose from the dead and he ascended to heaven, he defeated death and hell, and he's offering you and I eternal life. God can do anything... And if you're willing, God can save you. He led me here. Confess your sins and turn away from them, and put your faith in Jesus Christ. God... Please forgive me. I know I don't deserve it. Show me the way. Please tell me what to do. And God, please forgive me... for doubting you. In Jesus' name... amen. Amen. Ray. What is it, Bruce? My time is near. Please, Ray. I'd like Communion, one last time. All right. Your call was an answer to prayer. My first. What are you going to do now? Well, I know I can't kill Nicolae. But I might be able to slow him down. When I first got there, he'd just begun. If I could take out his command center, I'd finally be able to do something. How can I help? By getting to as many people as you can. Showing them the truth, the way you did to me. But, Fitz... Look, look, look, I helped build this, huh? I gave Nicolae everything he needed to kill thousands, millions of people. No, this is my mission. Mine alone. But there's one more thing that I want you to do for me. Sinless, pure, and holy. He suffered for our sins. His body was broken for us... so that we could live. And he said... whoever repents and trusts in him will be forgiven... and live forever. Please, take this now and share it, and surrender yourself to his will, love and care. Thank you, brother. Chloe, I'm so proud of you. A father couldn't ask for a better daughter. God, I'm in your hands. Help me, God. Give me the words. Gerald. How did you get in here? I came in the front door. This wine... is to remind you of the precious blood Christ shed for you. Drink it... and live. He could say the word... and I would be healed. O death... where is thy sting? O grave... where is thy victory...? He wanted us to have Communion. Yes, Mr. President. You seem to have changed. I told you I see things. Not having a good day, are you, Mr. President? Well, actually, I'm having a great day. I resigned from the militia... and I joined your real enemy. Chloe, what is it? Drink this wine and live. It's the wine. I can breathe. I can breathe! Oh, thank you, God. Do you remember Carolyn Miller? A lovely little thing, wasn't she? Well, she seemed to think that the only way to defeat you is with weapons, with the militia. When the answer was right there in front of us. Jesus Christ. The only way to beat you in this life, or the next... is to accept him. The last thing you will ever see is my power over his. Sometimes he doesn't let you see it all. Sir? Mr. President? Sir? Buck... we found the antidote. It's red wine. What? It's a miracle. We had Communion, and it's the wine. You're sure? You're better? Yeah. I'm gonna live. And I'm gonna be right here waiting for you. Oh! Wha...? Chloe! What about Bruce? He's gone home now, Buck. I'm so sorry. As God wanted it. Oh, honey, I love you! I love you too. Listen, I'm gonna be there as soon as I can. All right? I'm coming. We need to talk.
