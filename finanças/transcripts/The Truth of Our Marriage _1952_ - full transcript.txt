THE TRUTH ABOUT BÉBÉ DONGE "...that which, untested, becomes established, "might as well never have existed: "a birth undelivered, a pointless exercise." He's regaining consciousness. The worst is over with. - He's opened his eyes. - This time! Well, you gave us the fright of our lives, old chap. That was a very close call. He's still comatose. He can't hear us properly. He'd said: "That was a very close call." Ten years! He didn't know how true that was! His guts will bring him back to life. No, Jalabert, not my guts. My heart. François... - Where is she? - At the Chataigneraie. With Jeanne. Go fetch her. - Is he in the clear? - In theory. He wants BÉBÉ. What do I do? Clinically speaking, he should see as few people as possible. You know this isn't just about his health. There's the rest. He's right. Believe me, Jalabert, we have to follow. BÉBÉ should be here. My guts, my God! What have you done to me? Sliced me open? He's still bleeding, doctor. Alas, no, you weren't sliced open. Just pumped, your membrane is sore. Morphine! No, not morphine. - When my wife arrives... - I'm going. You have to look alive. I don't want you having spasms again. Jalabert, for God's sake! Can't do it yourself? Think of my dignity! We worked very hard to empty your insides. But there are only two ways: top and bottom. So spare us your dignity! - Left buttock. - Turn over. Well? It's going as well as possible in such a case. He's got all his faculties now. He's admirable, he thinks of everything. He wants to see her. - He does? - Yes. He's the one who's right. Where is she? She locked herself in her room. 8) Every other day, replace his chocolate by porridge... 9) NB: do not let him wear suede shoes after September. To be opened after BÉBÉ, let me in! It's me, Jeanne. BÉBÉ, open up! It's not locked, turn the handle. Come in. I heard the car. I'm ready. BÉBÉ, he's alive. It's Georges. What does Georges want? Three drops in orange juice every half an hour. Very good, doctor. He's asleep? Hello? Yes, I'll put him on. Doctor... Yes? Give him the text I dictated earlier. Read it back, please... That's it. Yes. No, I said simple food poisoning. Georges. Is she there? Yes. Yes, Mr Ducreux, simple food poisoning. Oysters? I don't know, Mr Ducreux. Goodbye, Mr Ducreux. Look, Jalabert, you can get up to all the mischief you want later but for now, leave me alone. He'd said: "That was a very close call." Ten years! He didn't know how true that was! That's out of order! All these virgins who think we're after their honour! - What are you after, then? - Get in. Drive on. Did you see that bag of Turkish delight? She scoffed the lot. - What did you ask for? - A pound of Turkish delight. I insinuated it'd make Georges happy. - Georges? - My brother. - You think she hasn't got it? - I reckon not. - What are you waiting for? - The address. Gare de Lyon. No, I get the feeling she understands all too well. - How much is that? - 220. And Françoise de P...? What about Françoise de P...? Is it for your brother's happiness that you meet her every night? Take Madame to the Champs-Elysees. What's wrong? Just that I don't like riddles. We'd better call it a night. As for Françoise de P... it stands for Française des Pétroles. - So you wouldn't understand. - Five days in a row! Business is like women. Some you crack first time, some you don't. Peasant! How did it go at the Ministry? As well as a hanging-up can. But I think we're back on the right track. Thanks to you! When will I see you again, country-dweller? Not for a month. Even if I asked? I've a new factory to launch and a brother to marry. Georges getting married? You never said! Well, it's probable. Why are you smiling? You said: "Georges is marrying." I thought it'd be your brother saying: "By the way, François is getting married." - And that's funny? - Hysterical. You'd be an appalling husband. Lift your veil. You'll make me miss my train. - Not in front of everyone. - Who cares! You're a liar. From the provinces, too. Ring up Rue St-Dominique. It is 100,000 pairs of shoes. And then cable me. I'll come back if it's worth it. Goodbye! You've been in Paris? I'd have called if I'd known. This is my new partner, Mr Courtrai. Mr DONGE, future president of the leather and fur federation. Indeed! After your report at the meeting, you either resign or take the presidency. I sent the letter yesterday. - You've no ambition! - I've a lot of work. Let's chat about our famous deal. - Cigar? - Thank you. - All right? - And you? - Fine. - A good trip? A deal with the army! To think it started in our father's little tannery... With his three craftsmen! The Chataigneraie is for sale, have you seen? And apart from that, have you seen Mlle d'Onneville? I've seen the Mlles d'Onneville. Her little sister came? That's saying a lot. She popped in one night then went back to Paris. They'd just been told their furniture had arrived. What's your future sister-in-law like? She's a sweetheart. She lacks her sister's sparkle. Did you remember Mme d'Onneville's Turkish delight? Yes, but I didn't find any. - You don't have any? - No, I don't. - François. - What? Do you realise the consequences? Yes. You should give her mints or truffles instead, that's all. Take it easy! - What's wrong? - Mme d'Ortemont is here. - In the lounge? - Yes. Fetch the bag from the car. Good trip? Excellent. I intended coming to see you. I do hope so. - You're looking peaky. - Me? I know, business... If you'd been at a stag party for your brother, you'd be looking just like that, and no mistake. I suppose someone had to do it. Aren't you being a little hasty? That's the question. Do you seek the hand of Jeanne d'Onneville? - Yes! - I was talking to Georges. - Turkish delight? - No. I sometimes wonder why I make all this effort. If it wasn't for the memory of your poor mother! Tuesday is bridge night. The girls live with me. It's the perfect chance to introduce your fiancee to the folk here. - You'll make a wonderful couple. - My word, I... Jeanne's a pretty girl. And you must admit Mr d'Onneville's diplomatic career has given her a kind of... Class, and that's important. A veneer. Let's not exaggerate. One that her mother, nee Chatrier, could never give her. One must be fair. You're just two awful old boys making a fortune. I am disassociating myself from you. For now, at any rate. Am I not a presentable match? The finest in the area, as well you know. But I've absolutely nothing against marriage. Against your brother's mainly. It's quite obvious you can't settle for just having mistresses. Especially from a certain turnover upwards. Georges and Jeanne make a dream team. You're not quite ready yet. That's the truth. That means just you wait! You don't know how true that is. The name, right now! And don't see me out, it'd tire you. One of the Du Tour girls. One's like that, the other squints. No, honestly. It couldn't be... Say it. Not Mlle de Villefosse? I dined with her guardian a month ago. She's due 100 million francs in stocks and bonds. You have factories, stores, prices that follow the cost of living. If they don't precede it! 50% fixed revenue, 50% variable revenue, the ideal couple! Talking of revenue, I wanted to ask you... Wait. Mlle de Villefosse... All in good time. It is the girl who was at the prefect's party last year? Look at how she's built! Like I said. You still see how women are built. You're not ready for marriage. Talking of revenue, have you seen Mme d'Onneville? I wrote to her lawyer. Her wastrel father left her everything. She's luckier than her sister, poor thing! I wonder how she'll manage. Don't forget. My place, Tuesday at 4. What about the Turkish delight? I don't know! Take mints... or maybe truffles. See, I told you. No! A marriage of love is all just words. You paid twice to find out. Didn't you? In Istanbul, I had thought... This is the River Bievre, not the Bosphorus. When you open the window it smells of tannin, not roses. You're right. Your girls too. You use too much makeup. What makes you think Jeanne isn't happy? Look at them. - Do you smoke? - No. You're right. It ruins your teeth. I hear there's a new toothpaste that destroys nicotine. Really? Don't you smoke? Mme d'Ortemont doesn't like it. She claims cigarette smoke damages the curtains. She's mixing up cigarettes and locomotives. Jeanne, I could imagine BÉBÉ saying that, but you! Today of all days! I'd like to introduce your sister to my brother. - Where's she hiding? - She's not. She's in her room, taking her time. You're not easily put off. Ah, the girl with the Turkish delight! The way you put it, it sounds like something from an art gallery. "The Girl with the Turkish Delight!" So you're Jeanne's sister? Why didn't you answer at the Madeleine? Obviously you don't talk to strangers. Not with my mouth full. Then what are you doing right now? You're not a stranger. You must be the head of the family, François DONGE. Everyone goes on about... How can you eat that? It gives me heartburn. Which would tend to prove she has one. But... Have you two met? Has anyone...? Well, no, we just... I'm sorry if that sounded odd. I of course meant: "I've heard many glowing things about you." And Mme d'Ortemont? You don't much like her? I feel she doesn't much like me. - These make you thirsty. - Let's get something. It seems to be working. Two no-trumps, with 3 little hearts. - What got into him? - It worked, that's the main thing. Where's he gone now? That's amusing. Do you know, the other day, in Paris... Maybe I shouldn't brag about it. Did you want Turkish delight the other day? - Yes, that's right. - They're waiting for you. Coming. Excuse me. We prevailed. Bravo. A fourth as patient as me is hard to find. - You're being sent to Paris? - For the next big case. We never get important cases here. Everyone knows that. I think this time... Sorry. With the wars, all the lieutenant-colonels, even the most stupid, can rely on their last line. But it's not the same for magistrates. Only private criminal initiative can achieve the same result. But it takes a lot longer, obviously. - One no-trump. - Two hearts. - Three no-trumps. - Bravo! There are soldiers who earn their stripes honestly. You for instance. Your alibi is categorical: you went through 2 world wars without leaving your desk. - So you're not to be blamed. - Shall we play? - I did, I played 3 no-trumps. - I double! What's wrong? Nothing. It's stifling, I need some air. When I'm gone, Mme Laffitte will say I had a hot flush. Your brother had his hot flush. He probably omitted to tell someone a few home truths. As usual, he took it out on the judge and the colonel. Ah, the canon has arrived. I'm very honoured you could come to my abode. You're thinking a young girl must be boring. You've a way of putting people at ease! For calling you François or saying I was a young girl? Both. You're about to become family. In a week you'll call me BÉBÉ. Personally I'd rather call you Elisabeth. It's a pretty name. No one ever managed to call me that. We'll see. It'd take a miracle. Then I'd rather call you BÉBÉ, like everyone else. - You don't believe in miracles? - That's a very big word. Big things need big words. For example, the happiness of two people is a big thing. It's something of a miracle, don't you think? Well, you may have a rather odd idea of life. Tell me yours. We'll have time to talk about that. Excuse me, I asked for a daring 3 no-trumps and I wouldn't want to... Go on, I'll wait for you here. Be nice and offer me a cigarette, would you? What do you think of her? - She's a kid. - A kid? I find her ideally suited to my purpose. - I'm talking about Jeanne. - Oh, Jeanne! She fits the bill, no trouble. Perfect. What do you think of him? He's tough. But I'm afraid he may be a liar. He's economical with the truth. Everyone is. But that doesn't make you a liar. You either tell the truth or you don't. If you don't, you're a liar. Perhaps we're not that tough, after all. What are you on about? It's Georges in the hot seat, not François. I'm sure your big sister will be very happy with him. That's all that matters, after all. And love? Love! If indeed it exists, understanding it comes later. Saying you're in love before you've loved is putting the cart before the horse. Jeanne won't be the first young girl I've made happy. I do hope she won't be the last. I don't think anyone will affect my happiness. Not anyone. I'm happy. Everyone loves everyone. Of course! Why wouldn't everyone love everyone else? Your turn. Do you mind if I sort my cards? Do you play bridge? I'd be a poor fourth at best. But I'll pick it up quickly. - One spade. - Two hearts. - Two spades. - Three hearts. - Pass. - Pass. - Four spades. - Double. Me too. François, four spades? He's gone again. You are puzzling. I leave you with big words then find you playing around on a piano stool. May I ask you a few things? Of course. First question: Is Mme d'Ortemont a professional? Professional... Oh, did she threaten you? Yes, she's a matchmaker. Second question: for what mess of pottage has Georges practically sold you his birthright? I'd rather leave the mess and talk about miracles. We will talk about them, of course. You said you'd say why you don't believe in them. - Me? - Yes. And you haven't told me how you'd replace them. Excuse me, I asked for four spades. Answer to the 2nd question: there was no mess of pottage. I fleeced my brother day after day, just to score points, for pleasure... There's no need to get angry. But I kept the privilege of the youngest to be a tearaway. And to choose the girls I want myself! I don't need to know that. Never mind. As for miracles... I saw you at the Madeleine. And I also saw you at the station. I must admit they were very beautiful women. But as for miracles... The truth is, I can do without them. The miracle is that everything can be done with this and this. The miracle is that it all depends on you. - It's also a theory. - No, it's experience. Everyday experience. I don't go in for theories. Don't laugh at me, it's too easy. - I meant... - What? What did you mean? If we go to the heart of things, does your theory, or rather your explanation, hold good for affairs of the heart? What? Does loving, or knowing you're in love, take a lifetime? Or is love something like... something dazzling? Love! Love's like anything else, you build it. In that case, how do you explain our meeting? I don't need to explain it. It's a coincidence. I don't share your opinion. It all depends on the depth at which things explode within us. The heart of things, the things of the heart, the depth... What are you saying? On the surface, everything's smooth. But it all happens deep down. - The words you use! - Don't you like words? Just one: to live. The others get in the way. The bigger they are, the less we can see. You talk too much. What happens behind is so simple. If I'd offered you my lips, you'd have thought I was a whore. You wouldn't have kissed me. Do you believe in God? In theory. But I don't have much time for it. Do you believe what you said about love? You said it was built, it needed work. Will you have time for that? Do you think this is the right time? Yes. It'll be too late after. I don't mind trying to think like you but at first, I'll seem to be loving you less than I do. So I'll need someone to forgive me. And in that case, I'll need to be shown the way. Even back then, I thought she was standing on ceremony. She only wanted to give herself entirely. Your black suit? As you see. Are you suffering? It was tough, you know. I feel nothing any more. - You're lucky. - No, François. Save him, Jalabert, and I'll see to the rest. If there are no complications... Speaking of complications, I'm sorry, it's an unfortunate coincidence. Your brother was to pay an instalment on the 15th. The 15th is tomorrow. It wouldn't be helpful to have my contractor shouting about it. How much? 1 .2 million. What date is it? Monday 14th. Have you done anything for Olga? - I called Vichy. - And told her what? To continue her treatment. Excuse me. No need. What's wrong? I'm coming. Something wrong? He's vomiting again. Next time, don't eat oysters when there's no R in the month. He'll be quiet now, he's exhausted. Open the window. Right! And what next? Perhaps a little stroll in the street? Yes. I'm suffocating. There. Remain calm. You get hotter when you're upset. - What's your name? - Marthe. That's a pretty name. It sounds like a mink coat, Marthe. - You like oysters? - Yes. I don't. I think they're awful. Can you understand that? Yes. I didn't eat any oysters for lunch. But I did have something awful. In my coffee. I was poisoned by my wife. You see? But what do you care? It's not your problem. Let me go! Where's my jacket? In the wardrobe. Take it out. Give me my wallet. You must admit, Jalabert was perfect. But there's one thing everybody but François forgot. That you absolutely have to act as if nothing had happened. Go to the clinic every day. When you talk and drive, you slow down. There was no point bringing Nicolet from the factory. What's that? 20,000 francs. Mr DONGE forced me to take them from his wallet after telling me his wife had tried to murder him. - How long have you been a nurse? - Eight years. And you get in a state because a patient is delirious? - What should I do with that? - Or me? You have children. Mr DONGE is not always an easy patient. Keep that as an overtime bonus. And stop getting emotional. It could harm your job prospects. Here. Let's go to the library, we'll work better there. - You have the papers? - It's all in here. - Goodnight, Jeanne. - Goodnight, little sister. Goodnight, mum. Why did you do this, BÉBÉ? Leave her alone, mum, please. "The patient continues to improve. "Nevertheless, visits are forbidden for a day or two." Signed: "Dr Jalabert." I sound like a field marshal, don't you think? The paper was a brilliant idea. The first day, people try to form an opinion. But now it's in print, they repeat what they read. That's what papers are for. You don't want to hear about business. That business with the Scandinavian countries... That'll wait. They called again from Stockholm this morning. That'll wait, Georges. Less than you think. I know you. You'll be up in a week. In two, you'll be bounding around. In a month, you'll have forgotten the whole sordid affair. And in six months or a year, you'll divorce. Very quietly. Something wrong? I'm just a bit knackered, that's all. My poor chap. She can take pride in her work. Take pride... She's not the type! Say, François... nothing's been decided for the party. - What does she say? - BÉBÉ? She says... that her dress won't be ready in time. Shall we call it off? - What time is it? - She'll be here soon. You don't need to keep her. The main thing is that we see her. The main thing... Why didn't you let Drouin come up? Because he's a magistrate? It's important not to tire yourself needlessly. Because you know what's important and what isn't. Your brother had his hot flush. Mme Marthe knows. What's important isn't whether people believe papers or whether Mme Marthe knows, or whether people see BÉBÉ walk by. What's important is that this business concerns me alone. Let them get that into their heads. Leave me alone! The party will go ahead, this year as every year, whether I'm up or not. And I will be anyway. I'm in the clear, so... Am I in the clear? If the kidneys are intact, you are in the clear. If they fail, that's another matter. When will you know? Between the 6th and the 10th day. Don't believe a word. He's trying to sound important. See what a state you're in! You can see Drouin tomorrow, he's in here every day. CLINIC Is it you, this time, BÉBÉ? Yes. Why "this time"? Because on the other days... a woman came... with your face, your clothes, your voice, but... I wasn't fooled. And I'm not a fool. But I do have something to say. Something important. I've made a decision about the party. - Georges will explain. - You want me to go? I'm not throwing you out. BÉBÉ, where are you? BÉBÉ, I'm calling. Your wife's been gone a good while, Mr DONGE. BÉBÉ? Where are you? There was a bad smell. - That was the tunnel. - No, your cigar. Wire Georges. SOS! What's the link between a shoe and a toothbrush? I give in. It's not a riddle. Oh, right! Then here it is. You make shoes with leather. I went straight to the source. That's why I'm interested in cows. And cows, as you know, produce milk. And milk, as you don't know, gives a by-product called caseine. Are you with me? Very much so. So... instead of throwing the caseine away, I had the idea of manufacturing plastic goods. Toothbrushes, amongst others. But does all this interest you? Not greatly, yet. Till now, I've had nothing to do with caseine, cows, and their hide. - I have to get used to it. - Why? Because this is your life, François. And I want to be part of it. Between the caseine and the plastic goods. Or even slightly ahead, if possible. You find it hard to let go of business. How do you know? By your cigar. You light a cigar when you're doing business. Should we turn back? Don't you think... We should give up our honeymoon? No! I must see Magu in Marseilles. Who is Magu? A Dutch cheesemaker. Anything else to confess? Yes, a ski-boot maker in Nice. I've not seen him in so long that I must meet up. - And then? - And then nothing. Just you and me, Italy, Naples, the sailboat, love... The way you say it, I can tell you've never sailed. Sorry? You say a Star, or an 18-footer. You don't say sailboat. What's wrong? Nothing. Looking for this? What is a couple, François? What is a couple? Tickets, please. Don't rush, we've got a lifetime. Excuse me, but I get off at Avignon. Oh, sorry. Tickets, François! Here they are. Send this telegram right away. Don't worry, those clouds mean fine weather. "Will immediately... "turn back. Take care. Stop. "Signed, François." Read it back. So much for your fine weather, chum! Fourth. - It's sticking to me. - Are you cold? No, not at all. A nice warm bath will do you good. Then I'll give you a rub. What can we do in a hotel room in this weather? Play riddles. What is caseine? What is a couple? What is desire, François? The shortest path from one person to another. The shortest... The best... Have them send up... Pardon? Oh, damn! Have them send up a double scotch and Perrier. Yes, thank you. What? I can't understand if you talk into the pillow. I said, did I disappoint you? I don't need to be disappointed to drink whisky, just thirsty. And I'm thirsty. Meantime, I missed Magu. Is Magu the Dutch cheese? Please, BÉBÉ! I said: "Is Magu the Dutch cheese?" I made him swear to call me before he left Marseilles. Did you tell the concierge not to disturb us? Yes, I did. Don't you think we need to be more open? What do you mean, open? Like a book. Like a window. With no secrets from each other. I was secretive till now. All young girls have secrets. This should be harder for me than for you. But I do so like honesty. If I disappointed you... If I do, one day, you must tell me. You mustn't hide anything. For instance, if one day there was someone else... If you told me, it'd only make it half as bad. Otherwise... Look, BÉBÉ, you swore to me never again to... Come along, now! You and your words! What about the Perrier? I ordered a whisky-Perrier. Yes, right away, sir. Don't worry! He's convinced I was alone. All the more so since he saw us come in together and he'll see us go out together. In the lift, he was wondering what he'd do in my place. Otherwise there'd be no hope for us. Back to that! What's the point of living with someone if it's no better than living alone? If it's just because it's handier... You regret it? You think I'm stupid? No. But you're like every woman. Concerned for the future. It's an obsession with you. You want everything right now and for always. You're wrong. This isn't about feeling secure. It's about not being alone and wrinkled at 40. You can fix wrinkles. That's what beauty salons do. But for the rest... the loneliness, there's nothing. Or you can marry, like you did. What's wrong? Nothing. I have to confess something. Is it serious? Fairly. I have disappointed you. I can't do French cuisine. - We'll eat Turkish cuisine. - I don't know how to cook. Old Marie will teach you. Anything else? I'm not a good housewife. - Is that all? - No. I don't intend to be. No doubt you don't want children for several years. I don't think... I don't think I want any at all. Here. All I want is to love you. That's all. Do I open it with my teeth? Sorry, sir. Allow me. There. Will you carry me over the threshold at Quai des Tanneurs? Why? Will you be tired? I just feel it's a lovely gesture. You won't forget? Can't you call me "Tu" once and for all? What do we look like? I want to ask you a question. Go ahead. If I don't report it, how does this affect others? If I absolve my wife, where does the law stand? Is it anything to do with them or not? It's not as simple as that. There's a question of conscience. Conscience... Whose conscience? Mine. Hello? Etoile 07-10... There's no one there? Professor Devillers, yes. When, tomorrow? No, no message. Yes, mademoiselle! To call me when he gets in. Why all this palaver? Do you think it's really worth it? She's twisted her foot. I did warn you. Can you walk? No, François. Won't you try? Try. No, François. - You want me to carry you? - Yes, François. Come on. That's so unlucky, and on the first day. Those cobblestones are killers! I didn't know you were so romantic. Romantic! Georges wouldn't have done such a thing. Mind you, we took an apartment on the 4th floor. I tried everything to stop Georges sending you that telegram. But business is business. We did get as far as Nice, though. That must be Georges. Well? Spill the beans. Come on. A contract for 38! You've caught me by surprise! Thank you. Wait... Wait, wait... Yes. Van Hopel. Wait, it's coming back to me. Van Hopel... I've got it! You bet! It cost us the tidy sum of 10,000 florins! That rogue tricked me! I don't think knowing how to handle it is the problem. The problem lies in knowing if together we can do something we can't do alone. You can always have kids. I don't think I'm a good breeder. I find children are... like a fruit. No one claimed anything else. The fruit of love. Yes, Jeanne is here. It'll be good to see you again. Thank you. It's over between us, my girl. Understand? François? Yes. I'm glad to be your wife. Mme François DONGE. I know it. From the first day. No, it's not that simple or frequent. If only I could explain... At first I thought this room was ugly and sad. I wondered if I'd made a mistake. Of course you did. The main thing is, you noticed. There's the portrait of your father. - What's wrong with that? - Nothing. Yes... he's everywhere. Always looking at you. You'll get used to it. I don't see it. It's a question of habit. - Exactly, François... - Exactly what? It's the kind of thing that scares me. If I lived with you without seeing you, it'd be... What are you thinking of! Tell me, François... Mme Flament... What about Mme Flament? Is she a natural redhead or does she dye her hair? How do I know! I didn't ask her. But... no, I don't think she dyes it. - She's good-looking. - Yes. And she's also an excellent secretary. We'll be late! What's the matter? - A cold? - The smell. What smell? Send for a specialist right away. Right. DONGE TANNERY This is the Chataigneraie? It is. This could solve all our housing problems, old and new! So you intend having new ones? Yes. In precisely 8 months. At least you two don't waste any time. In any case, it'd be great for receptions. Georges said you wanted to play host. In theory, but we'll see about that later. I was told not to kiss a gloved hand. Who by? My mistresses. Those who were women of the world. You're not jealous, are you? It's in the past. I'll never ever be jealous. Bravo. There's no more dining car so I packed sandwiches. My little sister's getting stuck in! It has four legs and walks upright. It has two heads... one heart... an apartment... taxes... and a short life. What is it? When did the headaches start? 24... 48 hours ago. I'm not sure. It's hard to keep track... Do you give up on my riddle? It's a couple, Jalabert. A couple. A man and a woman. What do these migraines mean? It means you're too agitated. You really need to see the judge? Yes, definitely. Because... yesterday I asked him a question, he had to consult his conscience. Why? Are you afraid? Afraid? No, I'm not afraid. You're being ridiculous. You'd be far better off keeping still. And drinking a lot. Yes? I'll put him on. Hello? I'm coming. - Better, then? - Almost. Almost isn't good enough. It'll take a day or two. Be patient. Excuse me, I'm expected. The truth against the law... it's a bit like the kettle sparring with the pot. - The whole town knows? - No one says anything. - That's a result. - Sine qua non. Meaning? That if nothing comes to the ears of the law, then... Mind you, if the ending... Well, if your state of health... If it had worked out differently... If I'd died. Then, at least, things would have been clear. The legal machine wouldn't have required anyone to report the matter before snapping into action. In that case, it's quite obvious that my duty, painful though it would have been, would have led me... To the Chataigneraie, with the inspector to arrest my wife. Take a good look at me, magistrate. Do I look like someone who's going to die? No, no... Thank God! Obviously we're just speculating. Treatment of acute nephritis. ...death occurs on the seventh day, despite exterior signs of health. Hello... Etoile 07-10? Yes. I'll hold. Yet if I could just tell her... If she would only believe me... everything could be saved. If only she could cry... If your dress is ready in time... If! The party's tomorrow. You don't seem to remember. - Have you done as I said? - Yes. Come and sit down. Come here. I phoned. In theory, they're sending a car round with an example for fitting. It'll cost a bit. How's Jean-Marc? Well. Did you tell him his father's away? Yes. Well done. I have to go. I lent Jeanne the car, she needed it for shopping. Like every year, the party is a lot of bother. Try to make it work. I'll try. CLINIC Until now, the urea didn't top 1 .2 grams. No. I'd rather have consulted you. Gasperl? Oh yes, Gasperl from Toulouse. I've heard of his work but I don't know him personally... Hello? No, mademoiselle, we hadn't finished. No matter. How could you do such a thing? There was no other way. No other way than to eliminate him, my poor child! Gee up, César! You went to the factory lab to fetch it. The poison? Yes. François was in Paris. I put it in my powder compact. Why in your compact? I needed it close to hand. It stayed in my secretaire. The laboratory... the last test. Yes. Four and a half grams! What did you have against him? Nothing. He lived his life. He looked at me without seeming to see me. Why didn't you do the same? I tried. Did he give you enough to live on? Money? He was very generous. When did you make the decision, and why? I knew I'd do it on the Sunday morning. Things have to reach a conclusion. It was either him or me. Jean-Marc was there. Whoa, César! When you saw him drink his coffee and grimace, what did you do? Nothing. Did you think we'd come to arrest you and that without some defence you'd be convicted? Yes. Elisabeth... May I call you Elisabeth? Yes. May I kiss you? A muslin dress with gold polka dots... Without BÉBÉ, I thought it ugly. In fact, a dress with no woman in it has no soul. It's been going on half an hour. Don't worry, that's normal. It's not worth disturbing him. He needs to rest. I'm off to the Chataigneraie. Then on to the factory. Go to work, old chap. I'm here. All the same, what she said... The nurse? She's mistaken. He's not delirious, he's joking. You know your brother, old chap. He does that. You can see the danger is past. You're in better shape. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. It's me. I sent only the blood test because the anuria is lingering. That's how it is. Thanks for calling. A muslin dress with gold stitching. Without BÉBÉ, I thought it ugly. In fact, a dress with no woman in it has no soul. I wonder if we'll have enough tarts. Probably, with that portrait hanging above. It's enough to spoil your appetite. Jeanne, François will be upset. Haven't we time to take it upstairs? Oh, no! It was hard enough convincing them. It's not every day you have an anniversary to get rid of your father-in-law. You'll still find a way to be late. I don't find a way to be late, I just am. I'd like you to find a way to be on time. Isn't her dress a little daring for people round here? The Gutlers have arrived. - Isn't BÉBÉ ready yet? - Yes, here she is. Here's BÉBÉ. I'm glad to see you here again. I was sorry to see François deprived of your friendship. My dear girl. Happiness becomes you. May I? We have to replace Georges and Jeanne. What did you think of my dress in the end? Perfect. A little ostentatious, no? You're right. You're not a girl any more. Did it go well with the Gutlers? Yes. And Mme Gutler is the former Mademoiselle de Villefosse that you almost married? Yes. Look, BÉBÉ, aren't you sleepy? You're tireless. I remind you I'm leaving for Sweden tomorrow. I know, Mme Flament told me. How are you travelling? I'll try to catch a flight from Lyons. Goodnight. Sleep well. Don't you worry! François, don't you think the buds are like little lettuces? Like little hearts. You think I'm ridiculous. It's worse than that. I think you're unarmed and younger than your age. If something bad should happen, you'd go to pieces. Why will something bad happen? I didn't say that. I said: "If something bad should happen." Be good and finish packing. I'll see Mme Flament. And don't forget my dress socks. Something bad won't happen. And if it does, it'll happen to us both. If only you could be less stubborn, less sure of yourself. If only you could help me. We'll see when I get back. - Where were we? - My dress socks. Do they say a woman in love commits blunder after blunder? You really are elusive. I don't understand you. Suddenly you start talking like a real woman, like... Your wife! What is it now? I came within a hair's breadth, François. Mme Flament's hair. Don't be ridiculous. I could say that it's not because... Yes, of course, but you won't. As you wish. I told you what I wanted. I don't want any lies. Is she your mistress? I'm sleeping with her. And she's not the only one. No, which would prove to you, if you knew about life, that it's not important. - What is important? - The time of my train. You want me to fire her? What's the use! Anyway, you did warn me. She's an excellent secretary. And you'd have to find another, and bring her up to speed, on top of all that. As I never enter your office, which stinks of tannin, and as you like strong smells and as Mme Flament is a redhead and an excellent secretary, then keep Mme Flament! - Is she married? - Yes. - What does her husband do? - I don't know. - Does he know? - I've no idea. Are all these questions leading somewhere? In fact... - What? - I really don't see the problem. I think I see it clearly. When you can't make a couple, you break up and see if you can't try something else before finding a definitive solution. What do you want? A divorce? You've had all you want. You're Mme François DONGE. You were almost beaten by your sister in the race to the altar. You won. By a short breast, it's true. A little too short for my taste, it's true. So now you know my tastes. I'm vulgar. So what? I'm sorry to spoil your girly dreams, but wake up. There comes a time to get real. You all say that! You must be right. So you don't want a divorce? It'd lead nowhere. I'm your wife, that's how it is. I have to get real. Look, I know you'll make fun of me, but... you remember on our honeymoon? - I'd asked you to wait. - Wait for what? Would you mind having a child right away? Is that what you call getting real. Be vulgar, it changes nothing. Excuse me, but I've a train to catch. Don't you want to? You're determined to? Let's go, then, right away! It wasn't to put you off. After all, this is your style. You could just think of Mme Flament or the others. They won't say I didn't try everything. Your solution is mad. I've another one. It's reasonable and sometimes works. Look at me. Don't you want to? You're revolting. You think that's a solution? What are you hoping for? Not much, François. So what's the use? I never really thought it was a solution. It's just the following act. Everything's back to normal, François. Believe me, it's better this way. From all points of view. We'll let Jeanne and BÉBÉ furnish the Chataigneraie as they wish. It'll keep them busy. And so as not to have our weekends poisoned by business, we won't have a telephone installed. That way, during the week, at the old house, you'll be left in peace. Killing two birds with one stone. You have to take them as they are, BÉBÉ. Happiness has its price. Happiness? Georges was right. As if by magic, everything seemed to go back to normal. A normalcy nothing would trouble in the years that followed. She would continue to come down last of all. They all called it an act and let it happen. It was now part of the tradition. No point in giving you a necklace if you won't wear it tonight. They really do make the most handsome couple. Old Mme d'Ortemont did not give up the fight. She's good-looking, don't you think? It's not because you don't like her that you shouldn't dance with her. Happiness suits you. Mme d'Ortemont would repeat that to BÉBÉ every year without changing a word. There was the year the Villefosses had an unquestionably happy result in business. There was the year of agreements with South America. The year of the Légion d'honneur. And the presidency of the cartel. The bailing out of Étoile Du Sud-Est. The year I refused to become deputy. But every year, every anniversary, was Mme d'Ortemont's year. BÉBÉ seemed fascinated. Dr and Mme Jalabert... Dr Henri Bernard... Mr Magnan... - He brought his whole team. - Who is he? A scrounger. I didn't know he was married. Glad to see you outside of business hours. This is my wife, who camped with me at the hotel rather than miss your party. And I agree with her. It's topping. Henri Bernard, a future great surgeon. My businessman, Mr Magnan, whom you know already. How are you? I wouldn't like Henri Bernard to operate on me. Why not? He's more leading man than surgeon. I quite like him, but I can't say the same about Jalabert's wife. Something about her annoys me. No, thank you. What do you find annoying about Mme Jalabert? If that's all it is, I'm sure you'll come round. Please, BÉBÉ, stop your little game. Why is her husband scrounging? He's a doctor in Lyons. He spotted an old house to use as his clinic. Well? Well he hasn't a bean to pay for the work. Is that all? Isn't ten million enough? Mr and Mme Gutler. Still as ugly as ever! I was afraid you couldn't make it. How could you say such a thing? Good evening. Nothing in the world could prevent me attending your party. Have you seen all this luxury? It's grotesque! - Ten million's quite a sum. - Ten million. I can see it'd make you wince. But I stand by what I said. I think you'll get used to it. My husband said you planned to settle here. It's a plan... An intention at most. A hope, really. The plan depends on your husband. Did he talk about it? François has no secrets from me. I rather think you can call it a plan. You think so? I think it just depends on you now. CLINIC Sorry? Oh, right! Professor Gasperl is here. I knew there were Black doctors in the USA but not in France. Mainland France, I mean. I met a coloured psychoanalyst in New York. What if we talked about your man? Is that DONGE, the industrialist? Yes, François DONGE. What has he eaten? Fifty centigrams of mercury dichloride. - How many days? - Six. - Diuresis? - Nil. Since when? 48 hours. That's why I asked Fournier. - Urea? - Six grams. And he suspects nothing? This morning, he was in a torpor. Let's go. It's a masterpiece, a real masterpiece. - It's a feat, as well. - It's amazing. You don't think... When I take this in, the drape will hang better. And if you took it in above the hip? We can't make another dress between now and 9 o'clock. Here's Georges. Georges, you can give us your opinion. Leave Georges alone, mummy. He knows nothing about dresses anyway. He's worried stiff that I'll be late. Indeed, I spent part of the night at the factory. And now I'm stuck here. - I'd be grateful... - I'll be 30 minutes late. Mme Laffitte got the order for petits-fours wrong again. Tell me, do you think they'll be long? I can't tell you, they've been up there for an hour. Right, I'll call back tonight. I can't see any other solution. What's the use of waiting for the necrosis of the renal cell? - If you're sure... - Sure! My dear chap, there's always a time when medicine becomes a lottery. I should have stuck to what I decided. I wanted to go to the cake shop first. ...death occurs on the seventh day, despite exterior signs of health. You can call from here. It can't be easy with no phone at the Chataigneraie. The anuria may lead to complications... I know. I'm not pissing. So what are my chances? Well, as the renal cell is under attack, a nephrotomy or kidney section is the only operation... What are my chances? Around one in three. More than is needed when a man wants to live. And I want to live. I want to live. To live... As the hospital surgeon is absent, who could tackle that? There's Ravau, one of the finest scalpels in France. Twenty-one dozen of each. Of course I told you. I'm reading the list now. Yes, I'll wait. We can try to contact him. Isn't it better for just anyone to operate tonight? Tomorrow's the 7th day. Ah, you see! Have them sent right away, the buffet is already in place. Professor Gasperl, Mme François DONGE. All that I've done, I have to do again. Have you seen the doctors? Yes. They give me one chance in three. So that's all right. They asked me not to stay long. Oh. Then I'll get down to business. Come here. Straight to the heart of things. All the rest... The hardest part, you see, is... From the start, I had to look after everything. Come closer. My guts had to empty, you see. And my kidneys start working again. The famous renal cell. All their junk, in other words. Come here. As far as that goes, Jalabert is right. First you need to live. And then I had to find out the truth and present it to you. To me, this is a game to be won, you see? So when I've won everything, we'll double our efforts and you'll see. You'll see how happy we'll be. I love you. Here... It's our anniversary, Elisabeth. I couldn't buy you anything. If you knew how much I love you... - You can't stop yourself. - Only death could... I know, I trod that road. For me it's over. I don't love you. But if I die, Elisabeth, you'll be tried. They have laws, they'll convict you. And destroy you. I know. And you won't defend yourself. Defend what? Yourself, and our child. Remember how we made it. He exists. He'll exist without us. We've counted for so little in his life. So little love. You want to do it all again, François, I know. It's impossible. You men love to decide that life is here or life is there. When you see you're on the wrong track and that you've cheated us, you simply ask us to start again from scratch. As if we could. Double our efforts! You can't begin your life twice. There are words, big words, as you'd say, that you stuffed down my throat ten years ago. Love, miracle... dazzling... grace... birth... Love isn't something to begin twice, François. I'll find a way, you'll see, I'll find it. What do you want to find now? Your eyes are so dry. If only you could cry... And what about hope? All is lost, François. But look, Elisabeth... if there's no hope when all is lost, then... what is hope anyway? Yes, I'll wait. If Martin can't come, what do we do? Is she mad or what? He has an emergency. All you can do is tell the hospital. The die is cast. Who exactly is this Henri Bernard? We'll give you a pentothal injection here. Yes? Right away. Doctor! Why don't we do the injection here? It'd save time. Tell them. Scared I'll talk? See if the ambulance has arrived. If you've something to say, let's hear it. If I keep quiet, who's to say my wife won't talk in court? She can defend herself. Jealousy... Crime of passion... So everyone will know your little business... in illnesses was a present from your wife's lover. That's how it is, old chap. You're ugly, François DONGE. You've used women. Yes, but other people's. Not mine. Don't worry, Jalabert. There'll be no trial, I'll live. And if there were a trial, my wife wouldn't defend herself. She'll say nothing. I know her well now. Leave me alone, old chap. Leave me. You can bring the coffee, Marie. She's not locked away, she's gone up to his room. It's her right. Is it her right to poison my brother, too? You mustn't forget that's what she did. Your cow of a sister! Well? We'll give him the injection here. It doesn't concern Jalabert. My little girl! Why did you do it? Tell me. Talk, it'll do you good. You're sitting there like a dead woman. Why? I don't know. Not any more. Perhaps because I didn't want to be like you, mummy. She's a monster. Relax. Count up to 20. One... two... three... Elisabeth! Oh, but I'm sure she's wrong. You must tell her. She'll understand. It's not starting again. It's re-doing everything. A real birth. I'm sure she'll understand. A real birth. He's tough. Go on! Our love, Elisabeth... God will decide... Don't think for one moment she'll change her habits! - I'm scared, Georges. - Scared of what? I don't know, I'm just scared. What could happen to her? People come later and later now. BÉBÉ! Elisabeth! Open up! Please, it's me. I'm ready, I'll be right down. What will people say? They'll say nothing, they won't come. Madame la Marquise d'Ortemont. I decided to come anyway. I thought you would. Do you understand now? "Love! If indeed it exists, understanding it comes later." So do you understand now? Yes. I think that you and François loved each other. If that's your opinion, keep it to yourself. I beg you. You can rely on me. Misfortune becomes you. My duty, my awful duty... After you, inspector. I won't take very long. Will you take something? Jeanne. Go ahead. You know the house. To be opened after my arrest. You didn't kiss Jean-Marc. I know. But he won't sleep afterwards. It's best not to. Subtitles: Henry Moon Subtitling: ECLAIR
