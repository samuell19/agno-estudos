Digitally remastered with the support of ZOLTAN KARPATHY Mor Jokai begins the second part of his novel with the following words: «Have you seen a new master taking possession of his land, long neglected by his ancestors and employing all his strength to restore it from the ruins? He toils endlessly, he struggles on for the benefit of prosperity.» I’ve served lord Janos for ten years. My late master doted on shank of pork. Right he was! - His son prefers cake. - He's still a child. I wouldn't say that. Cut the cake, Zoltan, it's your birthday. The first piece is for Katinka, of course. - Count! - Excuse me. May I have a dance? In a three with the cake? And with the plate on top. I love dancing with you. And you? You love being with me? Why, you're just like a brother. Yes. We grew up together. Will we stay together? Why not? You don't want to leave us? No. Never. You must know what I mean. I was asking you... if we'd stay together... forever. I don't know what forever means... But if you want it, then forever. And... not just as my sister? Zoltan! We'll be seen. Why shouldn't we? Because... I want to kiss you. Kiss me. You're more than my sister now. Why? This wasn't a brother's kiss. Was it? Forever? Forever. Important news? No, but I have to give an answer. Excuse me. Darling... they're leaving. - Who's that? - Me. Get dressed! - What time is it? - I told you: get dressed. We'll be leaving in ten minutes. She was pure and beautiful. Yours was a great loss. No one has entered this room since her death. It was your father's last wish... that on the verge of manhood you should meet your mother's memory. «My beloved Flora, l have a terrifying feeling that by tomorrow I may be dead. A deep sorrow burdened my days, my husband's love couldn't let me forget it. l loved a man who didn't know me. When at last we met, he was a happy husband, and I an unhappy wife. A whole world separated us because he was your husband. lf you will stretch out your hand to me, maybe God will forgive me too. Your husband...« Zoltan! There's another reason why we're here. It’s in this room I want to say farewell to you. Farewell? You can't stay in my house any longer. You're a grownup now... you must lead your own life. The case Karpathy vs. Karpathy is ripe. So you say! Or did you really make a step forward? Along one! I’ve had the defendant served with a summons. He got it yesterday. It’s a blow! A stunning blow! Colossal! After 12 years of litigation, we've had the defendant cited! Another couple of years, and there may even be a hearing! It took us years to collect the material before we could make a case. Then, for years, we were on the wrong path. We claimed that your uncle was acting in malice when he married a lady of dubious reputation, since from a faithful wife he could hardly have hoped for offspring. Then, just a month ago, our whole strategy broke down. The court objected to Mrs. Mayer, our principal witness, testifying to her daughter's lax morals. Evidence isn't heard in cases involving a woman's honour. So we've lost the case. No. Now comes our trump card. We'll try a new defendant. Whom? The law isn't that particular about a man's honour. We couldn't prove that the Baroness committed adultery, so we'll prove that a man committed adultery with her. A subtle distinction. A legal one, sir. And who is she? The person who's received the summons. Count Szentirmay. But this is dangerous! What if he should challenge me? He's a law-abiding person. He will fight the case in court. But such a charge must be proved! A leveled gun can be more effective than a shot. But anyway, we'll have witnesses to testify under oath. We are so far away from that yet. However, at present a more urgent matter has to be considered. This is the case of the century! We're in need of an influential supporter who's financially interested in our cause. That again! You want me to sell my rights for nothing. Like a modern Isaiah! - Never! - You needn't worry. Keep calm. We need money to go on with the case. Mr. Kocserepy has money. Lots of it. Sir, the assignment is affected. The deeds are in my safe-keeping. For an annuity of 2400 florins Baron Abellino Karpathy has made over to Mr. Daniel Kocserepy the entire Karpathy estate. So it's mine? Mine? Well... not quite yet. The document doesn't bear a date. Abellino isn't master of the fortune yet. We'll date the deed when in one way or the other, Abellino becomes the rightful heir. It’ll take some time. One thing is certain: I’m in a fairway to prevent the Karpathy and Szentirmay estates from being cunningly merged. How do you mean? The young Karpathy was raided in Count Rudolfs house together with Countess Katinka. - Now you understand? - Yes, yes. Sit down please. You'll act also for me in the future. It’s time we came to terms. What fee had you in mind? This businesslike tone hurts my feelings. For ten long years I’ve been flattering myself that we were friends. I am your friend. But services should be recompensed. Money... always that damned money. In the aforementioned deed, Baron Abellino offered me 50 thousand ducats of his future inheritance. 50 thousand ducats? But I gladly renounce it, since it'll burden your estate... What do you mean? It would be marvelous to keep this estate free of encumbrances. I’ll explain. If you allow me to give expression to a long cherished wish of mine. Let's hear it. If you would allow me to ask for the hand of your daughter, Vilma. You mean? But Vilma's too young. I can wait, sir. Those 50 thousand ducats aren't urgent. I will wait. I’m honoured by your offer, sir, and attracted... Dear friend! A coach has come. A visitor! A visitor? - Let me have a look. - Silence! I can't hear my own voice! But you weren't speaking, father. I’ll box your ears, naughty one! It’s a real man! Then all go to your rooms! Out you go! My friend Rudolf has sent you. My house will be your home. - Papa, please... - Don't bother me! She's a bit naughty. As to your studies, Zoltan... I must see the dressmaker... Tell your mother, will you? As to your studies... The invitations ought to be sent off... Go back to your sisters! Don't bother me! This will be your room. - Papa... - You... How many are there? Six, thank God. Couldn't he stay? Really not? He had to leave here. I’ve been your wife for 17 years. You've never kept anything from me. Nor do I now. I wanted to spare you this, but it'll be better this way. Read this. What's this? I’ve been summoned to court. I see. Now I understand. Thank you. He'll be better off in Pest. Yes. I agree with you. Flora! You must talk to Katinka. She should be polite to Zoltan when we meet him, but just as if he were a kind acquaintance. It’ll be hard. I know. For me, too. How is my little lamb? Well, thank you. - Any temperature today? - No, papa. Morning, my pet! I’m always begging you to spare me this rustic endearment. - Good morning. - Pardon me, dear. I had a tiring day at the office. I wish I could give it up. I don't want to hear about that! You'll have a brilliant career. You'll be a councillor. A Privy Councillor. A Secretary of State. That sounds good. It pinches! Mr. Kocserepy, wealthy citizen... How banal! And how would that sound, dear? Mr. Kocserepy, landowner, proprietor of Hungary's largest estate? I like ambitious men. I know. That's why you married me. But aren't you exaggerating? No. Hungary's largest estate will be mine. I’d rather not go to the Tarnavary's tonight. The child can't be left alone. She won't be alone! I’ve had a nurse brought in from Vienna. At the Tarnavary's we'll meet all the right people. You should think of that. All right, let's go. If they don't cancel it. Cancel it? I wonder... The Danube looks bad. I’ve never seen it rise to the yard of The Blue Cat before. Mr. Trommel! The Danube is threatening Pest, the lower lying parts at least. My house is on a hill. I don't mean your house. But our fellow citizens. Their property and lives are in danger. Help will be worth gold! Gold? Listen... I’ve had 500 florins to invest in a deal. You've got boats and men, try to hire some more. Not a bad idea! It’s a deal. Let's be the guardian angels of the town. People will bless our names. But take care that no one else gets the idea. Listen! They're firing at the ice packs! Number two gun! Fire! Sir! Sir! Beyond the island, the ice has got stuck... - again! - Set off the explosive! The fuse went out. It has to be relit! Sir! Honour me with this task! May I have a cigar? On the ground! Mr. Trommel! Mr. Trommel! Gather your men! This will be a hellish night. Hurry up! Welcome, Flora. Good evening. How can you treat this boy so coldly? He's grown up! I taught him what I could. He toured Europe with me. - He's on his own now. - You don't mean it. Why aren't you sincere? Till my honour has been cleared, he can't live with me. He's young and sensitive, he'd be shattered if he knew about these horrible charges. He shouldn't hear about them. Welcome, my dear. And your daughter? A slight indisposition kept her home. What a pity! Daniel! I can say no more. Your host is your guardian now. I passed this charge to him. But why? Why did I have to leave my home? You couldn't stay on. Tell me why. I can't be blamed for what happened. But... if I sinned, permit me please to ask you for the hand of Katinka. You're under age. I am a man. And I assume responsibility for what I did. What? Yes... For having kissed Katinka. Don't say anything... I know that was the reason. I’m sorry you didn't tell me that you regarded it an offence. I love Katinka with all my heart... - We won't speak about that now. - But... Don't question me! The dam! It has given way! Let us not arouse panic. To the Danube embankment! Let us hurry! Could I be of help to you? We'll get home somehow. Daniel! My God, my God! - Vilma alone in the house! - My daughter! No living soul can get through here, except by boat! - Let's go back! - Yes, Sir. Where's your house? On the waterfront! Next to The Blue Cat! Help! Help, for the love of God! I have two children! 100 florins if you take us! How much did you say? 150 florins. Did you say 200? 200, yes! Over here! How many are you? An old woman! Take her in! Uncle Miklos! How did you get here, Zoltan? I’m on my way to Kocserepy's house! A sick girl is there! Kocserepy! I wouldn't lift a finger for him! On such a night no matter whether friend or enemy! Don't bother, we want money! Who are you? I am Zoltan Karpathy, but never mind! Take me, for Heaven's sake! Patience, old lady... Man is forgetful in dangerous times like this. The money first. Who are these brigands? After them! Get out or I’ll kill you! We've been watching you, you bandits! Get out! Give me the ark! At them! Help! Take me with you! Come here! Do you feel like riding in a gondola? This is better than Venice! You can't get in unless you sing with us! Gather here! Are you insane or drunk? Watch your words, sir! People are dying by the hundred around us! That's nothing! I saw the Neva flood all Saint Petersburg! 4 thousand people were drowned! This'll never come to that! You regret it? Look, the young Karpathy! Your health! You're behaving outrageously! You owe me satisfaction For this, sir! Right! Here and now! Oh no! Later. In the proper way. Come on, let's teach them a lesson. In the proper way! I really ought to thank that young man. Give him one of the horses from his estate. Now about the plots at the waterfront... Talk with the owners of the ruined houses. Those plots aren't worth anything! - Are you sure? - No. Don't you see? We'll buy the plots like charitable souls. Look, this is my scheme! See? Houses, plenty of houses. Here is the town. It won't be able to expand unless I allow it. Now you understand? Our reformists shall build houses where it pleases me! Ingenious! Stop questioning me... I’ve told you what I know. Abellino is a sly rascal. He wants to get hold of the estate. And how? In some twisted, cunning way, no doubt. I don't care! It’s my guardian I’m worried about. Why this sudden coldness? Why did he send me away so cruelly? - Have you asked him? - Repeatedly? He didn't answer. Never has he done such a thing. He taught me everything, he told me everything. And now this silence. The case, isn't it? Maybe. Pest is far away, but rumors reach us all the same. I hear, on the night of the flood... I tried to help. You should help your peasants as well. They toil on your land from dawn till dusk to increase your wealth. Yes, I must help them. When my guardian and his friends get a majority, they'll pass a land reform bill. To enable peasants to buy land. A fine ideal. I also have a plan. Listen, Miska... Tell the peasants to lay some money by... I’ll give them land. And I’ll give you this morsel. You want to be different from yourfather? He was a fine man, in his own way. You liked him. That's true. But ways are different now. And I want to be a fine man in the new way. If only I am given the chance. If only I knew what's being plotted against me. Listen! Since your friends do not speak up, why not try the enemy. I’m sorry, I’m bound by professional secrecy. Besides, not being of age, you couldn't take any action. - And further... - And further? ...this is a delicate matter. Certain aspects of it are even compromising... And the reputation of your honorable family... I very much regret... I can't give you any information. Thank you. Goodbye. Mr. Bogozi! Yes, sir! Do you know this young man? I... Well, then listen to me... Am I intruding? Not at all. Do you remember me, sir? Of course, my friend. We met at the lawyer's. And before, too, I believe. Yes, I come from a village near your estate. Excuse my bothering you. What can I do for you? It’s me, I believe, who is doing you a service. The lawsuit... The documents... Well, sir... The fish is as good as hooked. Fine, then you can give me a small sum, as a loan. I cannot and I will not. I’ve had enough of your fish and hooks. I’m fed up with promises. Patience, sir, we'll break them now! And not only them! But also the politics of the reformist party. - These reformist gentlemen... - Who cares? I’ve nothing to do with politics. - My policy is money. - ls that so? And what would you say if their policy was to draw out the estate from under your feet? Or if it should go to the peasants? You know what they are planning? You know that they want the nobles to pay taxes? The man who can make me pay has yet to be born! Two hundred then? A hundred? Well then... Help yourself. I’m sorry... This was the only way. Thank you for coming. If father knew... I saw you at the theatre. Why didn't you come to our box? What a perfect performance! Are you fond of tragedies? It’s you I am fond of. You mustn't say that. Why not? I want to know why? I hate secrets. I’ve only a few minutes. - At your service. - I hear you met her. I want to remind you of your promise. It is my wish that we should stay apart. This applies to every member of my family. Goodbye. «Dear Mr. Bogozi, I’ve been thinking. My mind is made up. I accept your proposal. Signed: Zoltan Karpathy» Dear friend... Dear sir... I was right. The fish is hooked! And the suit? The suit? There will be no need for it. Agood lawyer knows human nature. He has his own weapons for fighting a cunning enemy, and a naive young man, like Zoltan Karpathy. I think I’ve found his weak spot. His mother's memory, his honour, his family... No need of a lawsuit. The estate is ours. - Ours? - I mean yours, sir. But time is pressing, and I need money. A lot of money, to purchase those plots. We'll get a loan. The banker Griffard's reply is very favorable. Foreign capital is interested because of the Chain Bridge. Mr. Clark... Your plan is wonderful. Wonderful. Within ten years it will be finished. - Marvellous. - Just a moment, sir... Let's have another look. It may seem childish to you, you're a world famous Englishman, and this here is just another work of yours, while for us, it is a link with Europe. Have you become a poet? I can understand you. This'll be the Academy building on the Pest side. If we can get hold of the land. Why shouldn't we? The owner will force up the price. Who's the owner? Daniel Kocserepy. His too? Here too? And there, and there, and everywhere! He bought up all the plots straight after the flood - for a song. - Scandalous! Another letter from Paris. Griffard regards the Karpathy estate an excellent security. An Anglo-French financial group has been formed. Our daughter is also interested in the Karpathy estate. It always opens up at the same page. What's this? Vilma's diary. It always opens here. «When he appeared in the window and said: I’m Zoltan Karpathy...» What? And do you know why it opens at the same page? Because it's always opened there! Send your daughter in, please. My daughter? Send your daughter in! What tone is this? Send her in! You want me, father? How are you, dear? No temperature? No, I don't think so. - Mother said that... - Yes, yes... Dear father... You're too young for such things. And that man is our enemy. - The man who rescued me? - It’s for me to judge! Go to your room! And I don't want to hear another word! Don't prevaricate! I wasn't sent here by the Court of the Law to guess at your veiled hints. Say yes or no! You positively state or just suppose that your late daughter committed adultery in her husband's house? We both lived in sin. I’ve prevented by God's grace, but she persisted in her sins, and died a sinner. These are generalities. Answer me plainly. Would you dare to witness under oath that your daughter's child wasn't born in lawful wedlock? It’s hard for a mother to say such a thing. Fanny was my youngest and my dearest. But the truth has to be told. And what's the truth? I don't know the details. I didn't live with them on the estate. But Fanny had an unfortunate nature, she couldn't restrain herself, and her husband was old, and... I know... I even can bear witness if I am permitted, that before her marriage she had a love affair with Count Szentirmay, later on, their neighbor... You're lying! This tone doesn't fit a clerk of the court! I’m not a clerk. And I wish I’d never seen you! How dare you slander my mother? Your mother? Who are you? Would you swear to it? My late friend, whose name you bear, was wronged as a husband. I deem it my duty to avenge that insult. ls that so!? You are a noble man. Would you admit in court to having spied on them? Would you slander a dead woman? Truth before all, sir. Perjurer! Base liar! I won't fight children. I’d rather tweak their ears! If you dare touch me, I’ll kill you! Leave my house at once! Lies and slander! Bribed scoundrels! Don't torture yourself. It’s not up to you to fight this battle. Szentirmay can cope with it. Should it come to a hearing, he'd parry these filthy lies! Hearings, judges, people... Endless disputes as to whether my mother was a harlot or not. Oh no! I’ll have myself declared of age. Then I can renounce my estate. Under one condition. That no one ever enters these rooms. It’s the end. It is, is it? You made a nice job of it, son! Athorough job! Honour! That sensitive noble honour, eh? Is it honour to give up to base bandits immense wealth instead of putting it to good use? - And if my brother... - Let me finish! I wasn't born a gentleman, I used wits and skill to become one! Your cradle bore a crest. Now you sacrifice human decency to your precious honour! You told me your plans, I passed them on. The peasants trust you. They expect you to free them from serfdom. Do you call this honour? To shatter their hopes with a lordly gesture? I’m helpless, I’m beaten! You act as if you believed their lies, as if you dreaded some dark secret coming to light. Why? I should say: shame on you! But I know you too well! So I’ll just say this: I don't want to see you until you've put right your folly. Goodbye! I have to inform you that my client, Baron Zoltan Karpathy, - has been declared of age. - How interesting. Why was it so urgent? Now he's free to dispose of his inheritance. He desires an end to the litigation. By amicable arrangement. This sounds very interesting! The estate can be divided into two equal parts. Each would yield an annual income of about 70 thousand florins. - He is offering you... - We do not accept. But please... Only half of it? - We don't accept. - But it's 70 thousand florins a year! And you can take your choice, sir. Dear colleague, this isn't a basis for discussion. But I won't let myself be ousted! - lf we're going on with the case... - Sir, don't be indiscreet! I don't care, this means money, lots of it! If you win the case, what do I get? A miserable 2400 florins a year, and I’m being offered 70 thousand! I don't quite understand. How is that? 2400 florins a year? That's no concern of yours, dear colleague. And I request you, sir, not to expose our affairs to the public. I’m a sick man... You want to rob me, to play my estate into the hands of... If you won't listen to me, at least respect your own signature. What's this? This? A promissory note signed by Abellino Karpathy. He promised never to enter into negotiations without the consent of his legal adviser. This is clear enough, I hope? I see. So it is 2400. No. Not even that. You violated our agreement just a few minutes ago. Thus it doesn't bind me either. But if you like, sue us for your annuity. You'll get it in twelve years. Maybe. Well sir, I think we aren't needed here any longer. The camomil's cold! I now realize with dismay that I should have prevented you from being declared of age. It’s too late now. I tried to save the day. I failed. The decision is yours now. Thank you, my mind is made up. I’ll renounce the estate in favour of my uncle. Under one condition. That he's willing to stop the case. And have all documents destroyed. I want to sign the deeds tomorrow. Welcome to your new home! The flag isn't out! This is unheard of! And where are the servants? Mr. Dabroni, a neighbour of yours is here to welcome you. He has a house and land... No land. It went to Janos Karpathy in payment of a debt. Mr. Dabroni is a man of the world, a famous fencer... And your respectful servant. I’m pleased to meet you. I don't want to disturb you. We'll soon meet, I hope. No refreshment, no bath, I’m afraid. The servants have all left. When they heard you were coming, they looked quite murderous. Are we stocked up with wine? They muttered about the old baron and Master Zoltan. I rebuked them upon which last night they all fled. - Are you amused? - Don't get excited, please! Let's make the beds. Come on! Let's look for some sheets. Here, fetch it. Who is it? How did you dare? What are you writing? A diary of our European trip. I’ve come to terms with a publisher. I must work for a living now. May l? With pleasure. Italy, May... We'll finish it at home. Right? We've better lamps, more light. Bogozi! Bring that water! To think that I frequented the Faculty of Law for years... For the many years. Don't grumble, pour it. I agree, this is a poor sort of work, but you won't regret it. You'll make your fortune here. As Mr. Kocserepy's head butler? As a lawyer and a nobleman... Should I wash his back? Bogozi! Go down! I don't want to meet them. Just a moment! Haven't I seen you somewhere before? Yes, in the next village. That's where I come from. - I’m Adam Bogozi's son. - Bogozi... Your father was a fine man. What are you doing in this house? Life is hard. These are wonderful plans. I’m very much interested in the future development of Pest. I wish you much success. The Chain Bridge will lead into a square. The Academy will be on the right. Many people want to have their houses built near the bridge. Large squares, wide roads are planned. Why is this so urgent? You must know. The town's choking within its present boundaries. It has to extend. I see. Can I offer you a cigar? Let's come to the point. We have been sent to you by our friends who have the future of Pest at heart. Building sites are needed. I see, the plots... Of course, of course. My plots. I regret, my present tasks make great demands on my energy. To take over such a large estate... To start work on it... I can't occupy myself with plots in Pest. Name your price for the plots. It’s not as simple as that. Who knows what their real value is, and what they'll be worth in two, three, or maybe five years. Five years? Maybe even more. Large scale enterprises need time. What about the time? This isn't my concern. I’m not the Mayor of Pest nor a charitable soul, working against his own interests. - But a speculator! - Miklos! I’m sorry. I got carried away. Our discussion has sadly deteriorated, let's end it. Mr. Kocserepy! Fate, and luck, has made you one of the richest persons in this country. I got myself where I am. Wealth involves duties. Patriotic duties. I don't need your sermons. I’ve been molding for 17 years in that office. A clerk for life. I got fed up. Now you serve the master of a stolen estate. ls this honest? Only the rich can afford to be honest. I have no scruples. I am used to dirty dealings. Like this lawsuit. I’ve been wondering, how your employer induced Zoltan to give it up. Zoltan would have made good use of his wealth. While Kocserepy... What's the matter? That's the reason... why I wanted to get away from my employer. He made me do a base thing. He induced me... to give the boy records of the case. Did you get money for it? Yes. And I kept silent. About what? The conclusive evidence. I drew up the records... on Kutyfalvy's false evidence. Damn it! - Let me in! - What is it? Who is it? Open up at once! What is it? Who's that? You know me well! I’ll break the door open! Who is it? - Help! - Here I am! - Gendarme! - Sharpen your wits, you rascal. False evidence, given by you in Pest, in a lawyer's chambers... He would have killed me on the spot! I had to sign the confession! There were two of them against me! There was no way out. Szentirmay will get your confession in no time. He'll have you imprisoned for perjury. And me and His Honour, too. - And the estate will be lost! - Daniel! Vilma's getting worse. We need the doctor. Send for him, dear. I’m busy now. Oh Lord! Don't take her away! Let her live! To hell with them! Szentirmay and that boy again! It’s your fault, you coward! You dolt! We have to prevent disaster! We can't lose the battle at this stage. The loan from Paris is on its way. We must act now! We're in constant danger! And it must end. If there was no heir to the estate... There would be no danger, if Zoltan were dead... My adversaries were never long-lived. Let me take the matter in hand. It’s urgent. And you wouldn't mind either to get your... estate back rather soon. Let us not discuss fiscal matters now. The count and the young man are going to Pest. I’ll follow them... I’ll offend Karpathy, or he will me. I’ll see to it. Then swords or pistols... Gentlemen, my respects. She's not in her bed! She's escaped! Couldn't you wait until morning? Wesselenyi's expecting us tonight. At dawn we'll proceed together. Don't catch cold in this weather. Who is there? Dabroni. They went to kill him... Zoltan, they want to kill him... Dabroni... Dabroni. - Let Mr. Kocserepy know at once his daughter is right here. - No. Zoltan must be warned. All right, dear. - Zoltan must be warned. - Yes, dear, we'll go after him. You'll come too. This is for Mr. Kocserepy. Dispatch a rider to Baron Wesselenyi. My husband shouldn't go on, but wait for me. Prepare the other carriage. Keep calm, dear. We're off. We must warn Zoltan. Open the gate! Take me to Baron Wesselenyi! He isn't at home! He's left with Count Szentirmay for Pest! For Pest? My God, Vilma! Janos! Someone should ride post-haste to Pest, look for Mr. Dabroni, and tell him that I said: Don't. Just one word: Don't. I understand, sir. Don't. We ought to start. When are we going? Where, dear? To him. To Zoltan. But I can't now. You will, won't you, - mother dear? - My little daughter! I want to tell her something. Only her. You've offended her. If you go to him, if you meet him, tell him... Of course. What? You and Zoltan... you love him, Katinka. Tell him that... that... I’m happy that you love each other. That's all. - Have you seen Baron Wesselenyi? - That way, please. How touching is that the Count cares for the young Karpathy. They're inseparable. Like father and son. Call on Dabroni tonight. Provoke him in my name, before Zoltan does it. I deem it an honour to give you satisfaction, sir. In the town park? At seven in the morning? Six o'clock won't do, someone else might turn up. At seven then. I’m expecting your seconds. I’m at your disposal, naturally, though I don't remember having offended you. Then I’ll offend you, you... That's enough. Time, place? The earliest possible. That is 8 o'clock. Because... I know. I’m one of Karpathy's seconds. Then... at eight? Earlier. At six I’m engaged. Half past six? I’ll have thirty seconds for you then. Ready! Go! Steady on, sir! Don't worry, I’m coming. Uncle Miklos? He said he will be here on time. There! We regret to inform you that Mr. Dabroni cannot be at your disposal. He was severely wounded an hour ago. And... our condolences, sir... It’s our hard duty to tell you... that Count Szentirmay... The documents, the evidence, it's conclusive... Yes... Give them to your counsel. - Stay, my dear. - It’s all right... The false witness... I know, his confession... Be wise... Be brave... As always. Katinka... Rudolf... Rudolf! Sir! An urgent message! Please, sir! Mr. Kocserepy says: Don't! Does he? Fine! I’ve come to a final decision. I’m at your disposal, sir! I am tired of litigation. Have faith in me. I’ll prove that Count Szentirmay... He is dead. My daughter is dead. We have no one to leave our fortune to. We shall annul our will. As to the case, it's senseless to go on. What for? Please, prepare the necessary documents. We renounce the Karpathy estate in favour of the rightful heir. But Madam, you cannot do that! Our decision is final. You can't do that to me! It’s my masterpiece! I’ve been struggling with it for 15 years. It’s the case of the century! We have no other wish, sir. See you later.
