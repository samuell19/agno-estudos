Thank you for letting me stay here. - Of course, anytime. So, I'm really sorry about the divorce, but I'm really glad you moved back home. - Yeah, well I missed you, and the rest of my friends, my family. I'm glad to be home. - So how is Junior handling the divorce, and his dad moving outta town? - He seems to be doing okay with it. You know, told him I'd drive down to see him as much as possible, and he can come visit any time. - Is his mama cool with that? - You know Tonya. She makes everything so difficult. - Tonya's been a drama queen since high school. - Tell me about it. - Honestly, we're surprised ya'll lasted this long. - It hasn't been that bad, you know. At one point we did love each other. We have a great son together. - I guess everyone knew ya'll would probably got married. - Yeah, when she got pregnant that's what everyone expected. I just wanted to be there for her and my child. - Yeah, but ya'll were always on and off. But I guess she was your first love. - Was she? - Hmm? - You know, there was someone that I really liked. - Who was it? - Do you remember Angel Adams? - Angel, wait, was she in the pep squad? She was really pretty, she used to hang out with you after the games. - Yeah, that's her. Every time I make a three-pointer or a fancy shot, I swear, I could hear her screaming about everybody else. I could always pick her face out of a crowd. - I did not know ya'll had a thing. - Yeah, no one did. - I think she was also with Anton in In Living Color. Yeah, seriously. - That was a long time ago. Yeah, but we hung out quite a bit, and we talked a little bit. I just really wanted to see where it could go. - Have you talked to her since high school? - No. She left right after high school. I don't know where she is. I think she went off to the Air Force or something. - Maybe she's the one that got away. - Yeah, I guess she is. - Her mom still lives right down the street. - Angel. Hey Angel, how you doing? - Hey Tim, I'm good. Hey Jenae. - Hey Angel. - So Tim, Jenae, this is Gayla, my artist for the event. - Hey, you sing that one song, One Day. - Yes, that's me. - I'm so happy I get to be your stylist. I hear that song a long on the radio, and in a lot of fashion shows I do. It's doing really well. - Yes, I'm very pleased. - Well, thank you all for meeting to go over Gayla's look for the event. - Yeah, we love doing events for you, and it's for a great cause. You know, a matter of fact, we have a great picture from your last event hanging up in our lobby. - Oh, wow, that's cool. - So, tell us about this new event, Angel. - It's a fundraiser for single family households, it's for a non-profit called A Single Hand Foundation. I'm putting together a show featuring celebrity artist like Gayla. - Sounds like a good idea, should be fun. - Yeah, and the camera's gonna love you. - Thank you. - With artists like Gayla participating it will be fun, but more importantly, it's gonna help a lot of families. - Well, Angel, I believe in what you're doing and I'm willing to help out in any way I can. - Yeah, and my studio will provide all of the videography and photography for the event. - Okay. - And I'll send you over proofs for your approval. - So why don't we go ahead and get started with Gayla. - Just tell me what you want me to do. Just head over to the dressing room, I have a couple of my designs. Put on the first outfit and I'll let you know how it looks on you. - What's the name of your clothing line? Jenae Patrice. - Okay, which way do I go? Down the hallway, to the left. - So, ladies, what you got planned for tonight? - I'm going home, I have a romantic evening with my boo. - Ahh, sounds like someone's getting lucky tonight. Angel, how about you? - Oh, you know me. I'll probably just go home and cuddle up with a good book. - Cuddle, with a book? Again? - You need to come out and party with me sometime, so you can find someone. - I'm not really into partying. Good guys are hard to find, and men are such dogs. - Yeah, but there're some good ones out there. I have one and there's one right for you. - I'm fine. I have everything that I need. - Everything except a good man. - Angel, I'm sure I have some friends that'll love to meet you. - No. Seriously, I'm fine. Seriously, I'm fine. - But, are you happy? - Angel. Hey, it's Broderick from school. I know it's been a while, I was wondering how you're doing. Gimmie a call, I'd love to talk to you. Hello?

What's going on with you? - I just moved back home and I wanted to find you, I didn't think you'd still be here. - How did you find me? I went to your mom's and I asked about you. - Seriously? You still remember where I used to live? - I haven't forgotten anything about you, about us. - Oh. - Uhm, so what're you doing tonight? I mean, you want to go out for dinner or something? - Uhm, you know, I dunno. Let me check my schedule. Can you hold on for a minute? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. - Hey. - Broderick, you know what?

He went to the League, then he got hurt a couple years back. Uh huh. - Yeah. Wait. Well, in a way-- Well, you had a crush on him. - I didn't have a crush on him, but I liked him. - Crush, liked, it's the same thing, what's the difference. Didn't he go out with that high maintenance chick, you know the one who drove the beemer? - Yeah, but he just moved back home and, so, that's why we went out. - Hmmm. They had a kid, they got married. - Yeah, but, they're separated now and they're going through a divorce, and that's why he moved back home. - Mmm-mmm. Uh-uh, I don't, I don't know. I don't know Angel, I don't think I'm too cool with that. - Well it's a good thing you're not the one he asked out. Okay. - Anyway, I gotta go, okay? Nah, nah hold up. Don't try to change the subject on me. Now, I just, look, I'm your brother, I gotta make sure you all right. I don't wanna see you get mixed up with none of these busters out here. - Honey, I know you're looking out for me, but, you know what? I really gotta go. Okay? - Okay. If you say so. I'mma, I'mma, you know, let you do your thang on this. - I'll see you later, okay? - Okay. Bye. See you later. Bye. - I'll holla! Peace out. Hey! Hook me up with one of your home girls, for real. So what mall we going to? - Oh, just the one right up here. Anyway, you would never guess what I did this weekend. - What did you do this weekend? - Well, I wasn't at home with a good book. - So what did you do? - I was hanging out with Broderick White. - Who is he and was this a date? - Yeah, it was a date. - Hallelujah. - Anyway, we went to high school together, and always, you know, kinda liked each other, but never had a chance to hook up. - Sounds interesting. - Yeah. He was like this basketball superstar and, I was just me. - Wait a minute, the Broderick White? The one who went pro? - Yeah, that's him. He just moved back home. - And ya'll already went on a date? - Yeah, and it was great. It felt like the years just faded away. - Hmmm. He might actually have a chance with you. - Yeah, maybe. - So, how's your day been? It's been okay. I'm a little tired though. - Really? Well, we don't have to hang out with Ron and Trina, we can just go chill. - No, I'm okay, we can still play cards. I really want to get a chance to know your friends. - Okay, cool. Well, they both went to school with us. - Yeah, I remember you hanging out with them a lot. - Yeah, our families are very class. We practically grew up together. - So is that why you're staying here instead of your parents? - Yeah. I mean, I love my parents to death, but, I wanted some of my independence, you know? - Yeah. - But, I found a place though. - Oh, really? - Yeah, I'm having a condo built, so it'll take a few months. - Oh, okay. So did you find a job? - I did. The university offered me a coaching positions. - Wow. Wow, that is great, baby. Everything is working out for you. - Yeah, but you know what? Between this new condo-- Yeah. - I mean, this divorce and other expenses, my money's. So, I'm on a budget. - Oh, hmmm. A budget conscious man. I like that. - Well now, you know that means that I won't be able to spoil you the way I want to, with fancy dates and nice things? - Honey, don't even worry. - Oh. - Hey guys. - Angel, this is Trina and Ron. - Hey, nice to meet you. - How you doing Angel? Nice to meet you too. - I remember you from school. - Yeah, you're snowflake. Ya'll were dating even back then. - Well, now, she knew a good thing when she saw it, just had to let me go to see it. - Yeah, I think maybe that was the other way around. - Mmhmm. - So, are we still playing cards? - Yeah, if ya'll wanna lose. This is what I have to deal with everyday! - Hey man, what you think about Angel? - She hot. - Yeah, I know she's hot, but what did you really think? - Yeah, you know, she, she a lot more laid back than she look. She fine. - Yeah man, we, we always had a lot of fun back then-- Get around! That's what I'm talking bout, baby. Man. - You're not even listening to me, man. I'm trying to talk to you. - Let me hit you back, let me hit you back. Yes I was, dude. Uhm, no, real talk though man, all right. You were so into Tonya, I didn't even know you had time to hang out with Angel. - Yeah man, I loved Tonya, but, there was always something special about Angel, you know? - And now you and Tonya are getting a divorce, I never thought you shoulda married her. - What? Man, you never told me that. - Wasn't my place to. - Look man, I got the divorce papers today. - She trying to take you to the cleaners? - You know it. - Tonya always been about the money, she knew you had game and gon' make it to the NBA. You knew that though. - Yeah, but I thought she loved me too. But I guess not as much as the fame and the fortune. Soon as I lost that, I lost her. - Hey, kill all that, dude. You're still famous, especially around here. - Yeah. I can still get us up in VIP. - All right, you know what I'm talking 'bout. We going tonight? - Let's go on and get out tonight, dude. - Cheers, dude! Let's go, let's go! - Hey sis, check this out. We good to go. Well I think, at least. You know-- - Okay. - Got a good list of performers lined up for the show, so, let me know if you need some more. - I think we could use another performance. - Okay, okay, what kind? Group? Solo artist? - Let's do a group. - Okay, group. What genre you want? RnB? - Let's do RnB. - Girl or guy group? - Let's do girls. - Okay, girls. Cool! Already got em right here, check this out.

Mm-mm? - No. - Now these ladies, we don't want them-- - Yeah, I like them. I've heard some of their music. - Derek, how you doing, man? - What's up? NBA superstar. Angel told me you moved back home, what's been going on? - Yeah, well I got a coaching job with the university, I'm just waiting on my condo to get ready-- - Okay. - Just chillin. - Okay, well, hey, have a seat. Have a seat. All right, thanks man. - So, I got something I need to talk to you about. You and Angel been spending a lot of time together, what's up with that? - She's a special lady. - Yeah, she is. And don't forget that. - I won't. - This is what I gotta do, sis, don't be looking at me like that. Shoot, I got some groups to go take care of. Enjoy your lunch. Broderick, I'mma holla at you, man. And I'mma take you to that strip club we was talking about. Derek-- Hey, look-- Bye. - There's this group, one more group. Listen, this one. No, uh-uh, no. This one is called-- - No. Can I at least let them try-- - Bye. I am sorry about my brother, but you handled that well. - Yeah, I don't mind, he's just being a big brother. - Well I can handle my own business. - I bet you can. - Anyway, what's going on with you? You seem a little agitated? - What? How do you know that? - I dunno, I can just sense it. - I got the divorce papers. - Oh, really. I thought it would take longer. - We've been separated for a few months now, but, she seems to be in a rush to get it done. - Do you think she has someone else? - I dunno, probably. I don't care about that. - So what happened with you two? - Well, the first few years were okay, you know? I was doing pretty good in college, working, and so was she. But, we all knew that wasn't going to last long, we all knew I was gonna make it to the pros. - And you did. - Yeah, and the money was rolling in. She and Junior didn't have to want for anything. We went to all the fancy parties, trips around the world, huge house with servants and all that. - Hmm. Sounds nice. - And it was. Till I messed up my knee, and my career in the League came to an end. We had to downsize. Tonya hated that. She fell in love with the fame, the money, the lifestyle. I just couldn't give it to her anymore. - But those were just material things, when you really love someone, you stick by them. Besides, it's not like ya'll were poor. - Tonya and her parents have always had money, and they planned for her to have that type of lifestyle, that's just who she is, and so many people are like that. Just around me for the fame, to get into parties, want money for this and that. - All that stuff is cool, but it's not what really... Counts. - What does? - True, Godly love. Loyalty, trust, devotion, compassion. When you have all those things, and God is in the relationship with you, you have what really counts. That's what I dream of, someone who loved me unconditionally, and accept my completely. Who'll never leave me. You can't buy that. Hey Trina, what's up? - Hey, hey girl, what's up? So I've got some news for you. - Really, what you got? - I think that Broderick what's to introduce you to his parents. - Did he tell you that? - Well, no, but. Ron! I said turn that music down, fool. Sorry, anyway. I heard him mention it to Ron. - Okay, so what did Ron say? - You know Ron thinks you're great for Broderick and I do too. - He hasn't said anything to me about it. - Well that's why I'm giving you heads up girlfriend. - Okay, so, what's his parents like? - Rude, ghetto freak. - What? Rude ghetto freaks? - No, sorry girl, you know how Ron is. No, his dad is a preacher, really nice, laid back always willing to help someone out. - That's good. - And his mom, well she's a-- Crazy! - Different individual. But she loves Broderick. - Okay. - Don't worry girl, they're gonna love you, and you're gonna love them too. - Okay. - I think. - Uh-huh, okay. - Son, how are you? - Doing all right, dad, how you feeling? - I do all right. - You sure? You eating all right? - Yeah, I eat what your mother fixes me. But you know she's all over my diet. Anyhow, is this your lady friend? - Yes, this is Angel. - Hi there young lady. Hi Mr. White, it's nice to meet you. - It's good to meet you too. - Hey mom, this is Angel-- - Angel? Is that some pet name? What's her real name? It is my real name Mrs. White. It's nice to meet you. - Of course it is, it means you've made it to the next step. - Excuse me? - In trying to land my son. But you'll have to get through me first. - Momma, come on. - Boy, don't momma me. If you had listened to me in the first place, you wouldn't be getting a divorce. - Sweetie, please, sweetie, now, let's not be rude, okay? - I'm not being rude. Angel, I apologize. It's just that I'm very protective of my son. He's the only one I've got. - Oh, it's okay. - Why don't you come in the kitchen with me while they go to work on that computer. - That's okay, Angel can come with me. She's come in the kitchen to get some coffee. - Come on son. Would you like some coffee? - Oh, no thank you, I don't drink coffee. - Who doesn't drink coffee? - Well, it has so much caffeine and that's not really good for me. - Not good for you? How come? - Well, I mean, it's not really good for anyone. - Oh, well do you mind if I take a sip from the cup of death? - Oh, I'm sorry. You go ahead and enjoy your coffee. You know, Mrs. White, you don't have to worry about Broderick. I really care about him a lot. - I'm his mother, it's my job. Do you have any kids? - No ma'am. - Ever been married? - No ma'am. - Pretty girl like you, why not? - I don't know. - Well, Broderick says you're smart. You've done very well for yourself. I doubt you have any trouble finding a man. - Well, I guess I'm just picky, that's all. - Well, so am I, when it comes to someone for my son. He deserves the best. I'm gonna make sure that's exactly what he gets next time around. Mmmm. Good coffee. - So, what'd you think of her? - She's nice, but she's hiding something. - Yeah, well I'm settled into my friend's place now, but you know my condo won't be done for a few months, but, then you can come down and visit. - I can't dad, I miss hanging out and playing ball. Mom doesn't do any of that. - Yeah, she's never been athletic. - Yeah, she won't even watch the game with me, she tries to get mister. Forget it. - Hold on, she tries to get you to watch it with mister, who? - Nobody, dad. - Junior, it's okay. I know your mom has a friend. - If that's what you wanna call it. I'm not playing no games or hanging out with him. - Hey, hey, hey, don't be like that. Respect your mother. No matter what the situation looks like. Don't cause her any problem. - Yes, sir. - All right kiddo, it's getting late. Why don't you go ahead and go to bed. Good luck on your game tomorrow. - Okay dad, I wish you could be there. - I know, me too. But your mom will be there, right? - No, she's dropping me off, she's got dinner plans or something. - What, dinner plans? - It's okay, because afterwards I'm hanging out with Matt and Chris, and we're having a sleep over at Matt's. Okay. Well, that sounds fun, kiddo. Hey, goodnight, and I love you. - Love you too, dad. - I love watching this movie. Do you know this is my-- Favorite movie of all time. - Angel, we've had so much fun together. I mean, it's like no time has passed since we've been apart. - Mmmhmm. So, do you think we're meant to be? - Uhm, can we watch Scarface next time? - Uhm, okay. I guess we can do that. - All right, well, I do. * You changed my life with so much ease * That's why I feel you completely * When I was lost you rescued me * - Stop. Stop, we can't do this. - Angel, I know you feel it. - Yeah, I do. But we can't give into it. Angel, you always pull away from me even though I can feel that you want me. - Honey, I do, but-- - But what? Angel, what's wrong? - I have to be really careful about having sex. - What'd you mean? - Well, there are risk involved. - Okay, protection? Look, I got protection, all right? We'll be safe. - Good, because we have to be. - Okay, I got you. - Nerd. No, Broderick. I mean, we have to be because I'm HIV positive. - You have AIDS? - No, I have the HIV virus, it's not the same. - Either way, it can still kill you, can't it? - Not necessarily. I'm on medications, and hopefully they have a cure one day. - You don't look like you have HIV. - Well I'm really healthy. Sometimes I even forget I have it. - So I guess that's why you forgot to tell me, huh? - Honey, I didn't know how to tell you. - Well you shoulda figured it out before now. - But things just moved so fast, but I'm telling you now before they go any further. - It's already gone too far. We've already shared the same fork, we've shared drinks, we've been kissing. - And you can't get it from any of those things. - How did you get it? - From an ex-boyfriend. I thought we were in a committed relationship, but, as it turns out he was into sex orgies, on Internet chat lines, hooking up with other women, all sorts of stuff. - Wow, okay, that's awful, and I feel for you. But, look, if I have sex with you, then I'm taking a chance on getting it too. - Honey, you would be taking that chance with anyone. - It's only a chance if they have HIV. - Would they be honest enough to tell you? Or would they even know their status? - I need to think about this, okay? - I can answer any questions that you have. - I need to go ahead and head home. - Okay. All right, goodnight. - Goodnight. - Broderick? I just, I just want you to know that I love you. - Goodnight Angel. - Goodnight. Hey Broderick, I haven't heard from you, so I just wanted to know if we're still on for lunch. Gimmie a call and let me know. - God, please help me. I have fallen in love with this woman. - True, Godly love. - But she can die from this disease. - I'm HIV positive. - I can catch it and not live long either. I have a son to raise. Is loving her worth the risk? - That's what I dream of. Someone who will love me unconditionally. - Please, help me figure out what to do. - I can answer any questions that you have. - I'm lost. - I love you. I can answer any questions that you have. - Angel, you feeling all right? You don't look so good, have you been working too much? - No, mom. Besides, I love raising money for the non-profits, it doesn't even feel like work. - Is Broderick the reason you look so tired? You two have been spending a lot of time together, lately. - Well, sort of. I mean, he is the reason, but not because of that. I told him, mama. - You told him what? - I told him, momma. - About your status? Yeah. - So how did he take it? - He's saying he needed some time to think about it, and then he just left. He hasn't talked to me, I haven't seen him. I dunno what he's gonna do momma. - So, he just left and haven't even bothered to talk to you? I was shocked when you told me, but you're still my daughter. I thought he was better than that. - He just needs some time to think about it, that's all. - Angel, you are a beautiful person and out. An independent woman that loves him, he should realize how lucky he is to have you. - Thanks momma, but I'm lucky to have him too, and I don't wanna lose him. - We'll see about that, but no matter what happens, you're gonna be okay, girl. - All right, momma. - Hey Broderick. - Come in. Hey, how you doing? - Well, I miss you. - I miss you too, I've been thinking about you. About... This situation. - Really? What you been thinking? - Angel, look, uhm, I just don't know if I can do this. - What do you mean, do this? I'm a person, and this is a relationship. - Yeah, but, things have moved so fast, you know? Maybe we should just slow down, just take some steps back. - You're the one who found me, and now you want to step back? - Baby, what did you think I would do? I need time to think. - I thought that we could work through this together. - I'm trying to. I'm just so scared that I can lose you at any moment, or... That I could get this disease and die. I have a son to think about. - Honey, you are not gonna die. - And what about us having kids? There's so much that I have to consider, okay? There's so much that I don't know. - Well talk to me! I'm right here! - You right, your right. - Okay, okay. - Let's talk. I looked it up on the Internet. - Good. - I think I wanna talk to a doctor, maybe talk to your doctor? - Yeah, sure. - Okay baby. - So, I guess I'll see you later? - Yeah. - Okay. - Angel. Look, I'm not going anywhere, okay? We have time. - But why waste it? - Angel, I'm just trying to figure out what's best for me. - You know, it woulda been nice to hear you say what's best for us. - Angel. - Goodnight Broderick. - I'm thinking about us, too! Angel. Hello, Dr. Cox's office. - Hello, hi. I was calling to speak to Dr. Carter. This is Broderick White. Hold one moment. - Hello, Mr. White? Angel mentioned that you'd be calling to talk about HIV and the risks of being involved with someone who is positive. - I thought having HIV and AIDS was the same thing, is it? - Someone can test positive for the HIV virus, but it takes time to progress into full blown AIDS, if it ever does. - Okay, so, how long does it take before you die? - First and foremost, this is not a death sentence, maybe 20 years ago, but certainly not today. - What are the chances of me catching it from her? - HIV is transferred through certain bodily fluids, blood, semen, vaginal discharge, and even breast milk. Contraceptives do protect against the virus. Men are more likely to pass it on to women than women to men. - Really? How is that? - Because there's more virus in semen than in vaginal discharge. - I didn't know that. - There are precautions you can take to minimize your risk substantially. It all depends on how you and Angel handle the situation. And you know, Mr. White, there are many infected people with uninfected partners, and they lead normal, healthy, and long lives. - Thank you very much for talking to me. - I'm glad I could help. - Thank you very much. A'ight you know man, I'm gonna. Me and wifey gon' have a little house all to ourselves tonight, you know what I'm talking about. Woo! - No, well actually, I'm leaving now, I'm heading back that way. - Oh, you know, I figured you'd be hanging with your girl, since we ain't seen you around, you know? Go ahead. - Nah, man, we're taking a break. - Trouble in paradise, huh? - Man, let's just say that she dropped a bomb on me, and I don't know how to handle it. - All right, well look, this is what you do, man, , this is what you do, man. Go to Crosen's, get them two-dollar roses, man. Go up in there, go through the express line, cause you gon' get it real fast, go back to where she at, holla her and everything gon' be straight, I'm tryna tell ya baby. You know, matter of fact, I bought some today, that's why, you not coming home. - What, roses? - Look, dude, look what I said, listen to what I told you. Go get the roses, and then holla her. Everything will be completely fine. Cause what you ain't finna do is come back to the house. I'm busy. - Ron, this could be a life altering situation. - I, nuh-uh, no. Bye-bye. - Ron, ron. - Bye-bye, bye-bye. Man up! - I have to be honest with her. - Mmm? Yes, speaking. Yeah, what about him? Why you calling me? Well, is he all right? Okay, I'm a couple of hours away, but I'll be there as soon as I can. Babe, I'mma have to go to Dallas in the morning. - What? Why? - There's been an emergency. - Everything okay? - Broderick went and got himself into some kind of an accident. - I don't understand, why do you have to go? You said you were done with him. - Well, I am, but he is Junior's father and legally I am still his wife, so the hospital called me. - Okay, uhm, do you need me to drive you? - No, but, could you give me some money for the trip? - Sure, no problem. - Can I use one of your cars, the beemer? - Don't you always? - Thanks a bunch sweetie. - So cute. Hey, hold up. Don't think you're getting away that easy. You know I like the lights on. - Oh. I love you baby. - Oh, hey. - Hi Mr. White, Hi Mrs. White. This is my mom. - It's good to meet you, we spoke on the phone earlier. - Nice to meet you too, Mr. White. - Hello. Hi Angel. How're you holding up? - I'm worried, but I'm okay. How are you two? - We're doing the same. - Thank you for calling us. - So mom, can we see him? - No. They are prepping him for surgery. But I'll send a doctor to update you all as soon as you can. - We would really appreciate that, thank you. - Man. - It's going to be okay, it's going to be okay. - Yeah. - Hey grandma, grandpa. Hey sweetie, gimmie a hug. Hi there Tonya. - Hi Mr. White. Mrs. White. Tonya. - How's dad? - Well son, your dad's a bit banged up, but he's strong. So you'll be just fine. But don't you worry, we already prayed about it. Yeah, okay. - Tonya, that's Angel. - Hey Tonya. - Hi. Don't I know you from somewhere? - We all went to school together. Broderick and I were friends. - Really? - Yeah. - Looks like you're still friends. - Yeah, we are. - Tonya. Is that an engagement ring on your finger? - Well, uh. - I know you're not engaged to another man when the ink isn't even dry on the divorce papers yet. - Is the divorce final? - Why does it matter? We both signed the papers and my attorney is filing them now. - See, I knew you were a tramp. That's enough, that's enough. - If I'm a tramp, I'm a five carat tramp-- This is not the place for this. - Two-dollar. - Two dollars? Plus 100,000. You wanna see? - So you're friends with my dad? What happened to him? - All I know is another car ran a red light and hit your dad's car. - I really want to see my dad. - Oh, I'm sure you do, but you'll see him later. Don't worry, he'll be back at the gym shooting ball in no time. - You really do know my dad. - Junior, let's get lunch. I'm going to quietly give you my number in a moment, will you call me? - Mr. And Mrs. White? I have an update on your son. - Yes doctor. - We're stabilizing him, but he's lost a lot of blood. He's going to need a blood transfusion, and then we can operate. - Oh my goodness. Well do what you have to do to save my son's life. - The hospital's low on blood right now, but we have ordered some, and it's on the way. The sooner we get the transfusion, the sooner we can get him into surgery. - I can donate blood if he needs it. - That would get us started, and we could get him into surgery faster. We just need to make sure that you don't have any medical conditions that would prevent you from being a donor. - Okay, well I can tell you right now, he does have a few medical problems, but Tonya, Angel and I can donate. Tonya, come on over here. - What happened, did Broderick wake up? - I'll have the nurse come down and we can get started. We just need to make sure that your blood types match. - Well, my son and I are a perfect match, we have the same blood type. Angel, do you know your blood type? - It's O-positive. But I can't. - Sure you can. It won't hurt, I've done it many times, it's nothing. - Ma'am, he needs a blood transfusion as soon as possible. You're the perfect blood type, O-positive is the universal donor. - I know, but I can't. - Why can't you? - I would if I could, I'm sorry. - You're sorry? My son is in there fighting for his life, and you're refusing to give him blood? - Oh boy, here we go. Honey, don't yell. - Don't you care about him at all? It's obvious he cares about you, and you're not going to try to do anything to save his life? He's in there, and he might die. And you're gonna sit out here and do nothing? - I do care about him. - Then prove it. You're the perfect donor, donate it, and help save my son's life. Mrs. White, I'm HIV positive. - Oh shit! - What? - As you indicated, you cannot donate blood. So Mrs. White, if the two of you would come with me, please. - Do I have to? - So does my son know? - Yes. It's okay. It's okay. You have no idea how hard it was telling everybody about my condition like that. - Oh, come on Angel, don't be hard on yourself like that. You know, it'd be okay, it'd be okay. - What if they never... Really accept me? - Who cares? I mean, it ain't for them to accept you. I accept you, momma accept you. Momma always told you, you're beautiful inside and out, so it don't matter what they say. You know, you love Broderick, Broderick love you, I know it. - Yeah, but, you when he wakes up, is he still going to feel the same way? - Let's pray that he do, let's be there for him. - Yeah. - I got faith. Have a little faith. Okay. - I'm gonna go over and see what's up with his parents and everybody else. The little boy probably need some company, so I might go play some games with him or something. - Oh, okay. - So, I'll see you later. All right. - So Ron, what's going on with Broderick and Angel? - What's it to ya? You divorcing my boy. - So, I still got a right to know who he's seeing and who he's having around my son. - You and Junior just got here. Besides, you barely met her. - Well. Are they serious? - Yeah. - Well did ya'll know she had HIV? - What? - She has HIV. You didn't know? We just found out a while ago. - If she does have it, why would she tell you? - Broderick needed a blood transfusion, she had to explain why she couldn't give blood. - Dang. No I ain't know. And she been to the house, she drank out our glasses and, she used our towels. - And she didn't say nothing? - No! Not to me or Trina. Uhm, I wonder about Broderick. - Well, I wouldn't wanna be around nobody with AIDS, and you shouldn't either. - He'll be all right. Before you know it, you guys will be hanging out just like usual. - I don't think so, Trina, so much has happened. - Well, I know you guys are having some problems, but, it'll be all right. - No, you don't know. But you know what, I guess I might as well tell you. - Tell me what? - The reason that I couldn't donate blood to Broderick is because I'm HIV positive. - HIV positive? - Yeah. - Angel, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Are you taking care of yourself? - I'm fine, don't worry about me. - So, who all knows? - Broderick parents, Tonya and Junior were all in the room when I had to tell the doctor. - That could not have been easy for you. - No, it wasn't. I really didn't expect it to come out like this. - Does Broderick know? - Yeah, I told him about a week ago. - Is that why you guys are on the outs? - Yeah, he's been distant from me ever since I told him. - Oh, okay, so, okay. And then this happens. And you don't even know if you guys are together. - Exactly. - It all makes sense now, so what're you going to do? - I'm going to stand by him, and get him through this. If he'll let me. - I think Broderick would want you to be here with him, and I hope you guys make it through this. - Do you really think we can? - You're the same person he met. You love him. You make him happy. And that's what matters. - Thanks Trina. It's gonna be okay, you'll see. - Mr. And Mrs. White, as you can see, your son is resting comfortably. The surgery went pretty well. - So when will he wake up? - We don't know that. We don't know when, or if he'll wake up. But he made it through the surgery, as well as can be expected. - Oh my goodness, my poor baby. - The worst is over, all we have to do now is just wait. - Okay doctor, thank you. - You're welcome. And our nurses will take really good care of him, don't worry about that. - Is there anything that we can do? - Yes, you can talk to him, you may wanna read to him, a little music might be nice. Anything you can do that you think will get through to him, feel free to do that. For now I think you two should go home and get some rest. So I'll see you tomorrow on my rounds. - Thank you doctor. - Okay. Goodnight. - She was nice. Come on, honey, let me take you home. - I don't wanna leave him alone. - You heard what the doctor said, the nurses will take care of him. - It's not the same. - I can stay with him tonight. - I really don't think you should. - That you Angel, we really appreciate that. - You don't have to thank me Mr. White. - Oh, yes we do. ♪ I'm giving you my everything ♪ ♪ Cause you deserve the best of me ♪ ♪ Loving you is so easy ♪ ♪ I feel that we were meant to be ♪ ♪ You changed my life with so much ease ♪ ♪ Now I feel so complete ♪ ♪ There has never been another ♪ ♪ Who can be my friend and lover ♪ ♪ You're all that I need and more ♪ ♪ You're all that I need and more ♪ Good morning, Angel. - Good morning, Mr. White. Mrs. White. - How did he do? - Pretty much the same as yesterday. - Okay, well you can leave now. - I would really rather stay in case something happen. - You really don't have to. - Well I want to, so I'll just go to the break room and get something to eat and I'll wait outside. - That's fine Angel. - Will either of you like something? - Oh, no thanks. We ate before we came. - Okay. - Take your time. Are you leaving? - Yes, I can't hang around here any longer waiting to see if Broderick will wake up. - It's only been a few days, he could wake up at any time. - Or he might not. Besides, it's not going any good for me to stay. - Well if you actually visited him, and talked to him, he might actually wake up. - Look, I have a life to get back to. - You mean you have a fiance to get back to, that's the real reason you're in a hurry to leave. - Well that's really none of your business. - Tonya, watch your tone with my wife. - Junior and I are leaving. Junior come on, I'm ready to go. - But mom, I don't wanna leave dad. - Well, honey. I'm sorry, but momma's gotta get back. - Why? It's not like you have a job and I'm out of school. - Cause I have things to do, come on Junior. They're not more important than dad. - Why don't you leave the boy with us? Come back and get him later. - Yeah, let me stay here with grandma and granddad. - Maybe, but I don't want him around Angel with her, her AIDS and everything. She don't have AIDS, she has HIV. - HIV, AIDS, same thing. - You staying, you leaving, same thing. You don't have to worry about that. We'll take good care of him. - Okay, fine. He can stay, for a while. - Thanks mom. - Aww, honey. Sweetie, come here. I've gotta get on the road, but I'mma call and check on you, okay? - Okay, and I'll let you know when dad wakes up. - Oh, okay honey. I love you. I love you too. - Your forgot one. That's Junior's bag. Angel. Hey. - Hey Ron. How's it going? - Okay. How's Broderick? Is something wrong? - No, he's still about the same. - Oh, okay, so, so what's happening? Uhm, are you gonna let me in? - Nah. Nope. - What? Why not? - You know, because of the, you know. The AIDS thing. - First of all, I don't have AIDS, and it's not a thing, it's a medical condition. Just like your diabetes. - I know you're not comparing your AIDS to my diabetes. - They're both medical conditions that we have to live with everyday and take medicine for. - But yours is an STD, big difference. Yours will kill you way faster than, than diabetes will kill me. - That is not true, I can live just as long as you can. - But yours is contagious. Diabetes ain't. - But stupidity is. Come on in, Angel. Uhg, close the door. Angel, how are you? I've been better. - How's Broderick? - Still the same, he's stable, but not responsive. - Man, I hope he comes outta this. - Well, that's why I came by. I thought if I could get some of his things and take them up there, then it might make him feel more at home. - That's a good idea, that might help. Let's go into his room and find some stuff. Okay. - You know, uhm, I can go get it, just, just tell me what it is you want, I'll go get it for you. - Well, I dunno. Uhm, maybe his team hat, his iPod, and his cologne. You know how he likes to smell good. - Mmm-hmmm. - Okay. I can get that. I'll be right back. Don't move. Don't move. - So, how are things going with his parents? - His dad has been really understanding, but his mom barely thought I was good enough for him before, so now she definitely doesn't. - Must be really hard to deal with. Is that why you didn't tell us? - Yeah, most people react just like Ron. They're afraid of being around me, don't want to touch me, thinking that they might catch it, and they just stop treating me like a normal person. - Really sorry about Ron. - You don't have to apologize for him, it's not your fault. - Still must be really hurtful. I mean, you're already worried about Broderick and how he's going to react. - Yeah. - If he even wakes up. - He will wake up. No matter what he decides about us, the most important thing is for him to get through this. - Thanks Ron. See ya Trina. Bye girl. I'll see you later. Now you call me if you need anything, okay? All right, I will. - Buh-bye. - Did you have to practically kick her out? Wasn't it bad enough you treated her like a leper? - No I didn't. I don't feel comfortable with her being here touching stuff and hugging and-- - Ron, you can't catch HIV by contact. - I know. - Well why you trippin'? - You know, cause, I dunno. Man, look, it just don't seem normal. - She's the same person. I thought you liked her, she's our friend. - I did like her, but, she shoulda told us this in the beginning and, she sure should've told Broderick before now. - They've only been dating a couple of months, and we just met her. Why would she confide in something so important so soon? - I feel like we had the right to know. - Oh really? What about her? She has to deal with this everyday. The fear, the rejection, the ignorance. If people like you treat her this way, imagine how people who don't even know her treat her. - I was thinking about you too! - Really? - What if it was me? What if I had it? - That wouldn't happen, we've been together since high school. - But what if? - Look, it ain't you, it's her. And I don't think we should continue seeing her anymore. Broderick probably wouldn't either. - So disappointed in you. I hope Broderick doesn't think like you do. Hi junior. - Hey. - Hi Mrs. White. - Hi Angel. I didn't know you were coming back. - Yes ma'am. - Junior needs to spend some time with his dad, so maybe you can come back later. - We're about to watch the game, did you know dad played in pro ball? - I did. In high school that's all he talked about, and I knew he would make it. - I thought maybe if we watch the game he would hear and wake up or something. - Oh, even though he's not awake, he can probably still hear you and knows that you're watching the game with him. - You really think so? - Yeah, I do. Matter of fact, one of the things that I got from his apartment was his team hat. I was gonna put it on him myself, but maybe you'd like to wear it. - Yeah, that would be really cool. - Well, you know what, I'm gonna go ahead and just go, and let you guys enjoy the game. - You don't have to go, stay here and watch the game with us. - Oh, thank you. That's really sweet. But you know what, it's okay. I'll see you guys later. - Later. - Bye Angel. - Bye Mrs. White. - Okay sweetheart, we really need for you to wake up now. We've all been praying for you too, and believing in God to answer us. And I know he answers prayers, because he brought you back into my life. I had everything that I needed, and wanted, except someone to share it all with. Someone to love truly, who would love me back equally. Someone who could see my heart, my mind and my soul, who could look right through me, and still enjoy the view. And that someone is you. I never believed that soulmates existed before, but now, I know that they do. You're my everything. Please, please come back to me. ♪ Who would have thought this could happen to me ♪ ♪ How could it be ♪ ♪ Oh, why oh why me ♪ ♪ He will still love me ♪ ♪ He will still love me ♪ ♪ He will still love me ♪ ♪ As I am ♪ ♪ He will ♪ Oh my God, you're awake. - Yeah. - How do you feel? - Tired, and sore. What happened? - Don't worry about that, you're gonna be okay. You came back to me. - You asked me to. - You heard me? - It's like, he was so far away for me but at the same time, so close. What happened? - You were in a car wreck, but everything's gonna be fine. - All I remember is seeing... bright lights coming towards me. - Honey, just relax. I'mma go get the doctor and call your parents, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Thought I was gonna die. - Well, I have good news. His heart rate is normal, vital signs are stable, motor skills are fine, he's doing great. I'm very pleased with his progress. - Good, good. - I'd like to observe him for another day or two, then I think he'll be able to go home. - Thank you for bringing our son back to us. - These situations take a lot of support from family and friends, and you guys have done a great job of that. So, do you have any other questions of me? - Can we go in and see him? - Absolutely. I'll see you in about a week. - Great, let's go see how he's doing. - Thank you. - Angel, are you coming? - Oh, no, you go ahead. - What's going on? - I just need some time to think, and just to get myself together. - Junior, you wanna come on in with us? - Yes sir. - Come on, man. It's about time you woke up. - Oh really? You were worried, huh? - Yes, sir, we all were. Grandma and granddad prayed everyday. Sometimes even twice a day. I prayed too, but not everyday, but a lot. - Well that's cool little man. Hey, you're dudding my hat? - Yes sir, Angel got it form your apartment, and she let me wear it. - Oh, so you met her. - Yeah, she's cool. Son, I'm so glad you're okay. - I'm sorry I worried you, mom. Where's Angel. - She didn't want to come in. Said she had to get herself together or something. After all this time waiting for you to wake up, seems like she's scared. - It's okay, I could use some time to get my head together too. - Junior, why don't you go in the break room and get some snacks, while we talk with your daddy. Yes ma'am. - So what's going on? - Things got complicated before the accident. - Complicated how? - I don't think I should tell you just yet, I need to talk to her first before I say anything. - Is this about her HIV? - What? You know about that? - Honey, everybody knows. - How? - She told us. - Wow. - It came out while you were in a coma, when you needed a blood transfusion. - So, what'd you all think about it? - What's important is what you think about it, and how you feel about her, and how does HIV change that. - Before the accident, she told me, and I was trying to wrap my head around it. And I pushed her away. - Really? I tried to keep her away from here, but she was here everyday, working and eating, even sleeping here. - Yeah, I know. I could hear her voice, constantly. I could feel her near me. Sometimes I could even smell her scent. I love her, but it's so much more than that, I feel connected to her, like she's a part of me that's always been there. And I didn't realize it until I saw her again. - Sounds like someone found his missing rib. - Huh? Missing rib? - Yes son, I believe God created someone for everyone, but there's one person anointed to deal with your flaws, to compliment your positives, to enhance you, complete you. Whether you were lucky to find that person or not, or even keep them is another story. - I have that with Angel, but I almost let her HIV blind me to that. I almost lost her. - But you didn't, she's been with you the entire time. Taking care of you, even better than she does herself. She put your needs first, and she's devoted to you. And, she's a praying woman. - Well mom, you actually sound like you like her. - I didn't dislike her, I just knew she was hiding something. And I was worried for you. I know I haven't made it easy for her, but she hung in here anyway, and I respect that. I admire a woman who loves you so much, and is so good to you, and for you. - Hey, how you feeling? * He will still love me Honey, what's wrong? ♪ He will still love me ♪ - Angel, I coulda died in that car accident. I've been so foolish, for pushing you away from me. ♪ He will ♪ I coulda lost you, I coulda lost us. You're a part of me. And, I can't see my life without you. So I'm blessed. I'm blessed that I made it through that car accident, that I have my family and my friends here with me, and that I still have you. - Of course you still have me. - Angel, I'm so sorry. I wouldn't have blamed you if you woulda left me. - Honey, I would never desert you when you needed me. I'll always be there for you. - Like I shoulda been there for you, instead of pulling away from you. I shoulda comforted you, and supported you. Please forgive me. - It's okay, everything will be fine. - And it will be. We're gonna get through everything together from now on. I love you. - I love you too. Derek, what are you doing? - We getting ready, why-- No, the band is getting ready, and you're playing around. Come on down. - Okay! I gotta James Brown-- You gotta what? - Heyyy!

We got one more performance, but, but before we do, somebody have something that they wanna say. Somebody has something that they wanna say. - Who dis? - Angel. - Yeah? - I've seen first hand how short life can be. You can lose it in an instant, or someone close to you in a blink of an eye.
