Eve? Is it weird watching a nuclear explosion right after we've had sex? That's just what life is now. Yeah. It could happen to us any time, now. This is Brooklyn internet radio. Rainy skies this morning with possible clearing this afternoon. Next up is international news. Because of escalating tension between the United States and... and between... and the United States... the United States Army has been deployed. Top story this morning, the President announced the roll out of his plan which has been approved by Congress. Residents of major cities are being asked to practice their escape plans... both have dramatically increased their manufacture of nuclear weapons. Both countries are threatening to use nuclear weapons... The White House warns it could come at any time, nuclear, nuclear weapons, the President urges citizens to remain calm. Local governments have provided guidelines on how many people are to practice their escape plans. People will practice in turns... practice escaping... escape. So, this is Poughkeepsie. It feels weird to be here. Well, the government suggested it. Since when does the government give good advice? We're actually practicing what to do if a nuclear bomb goes off. With what's going on in the world, it could happen any day. We're practicing how to evacuate out of New York City. Well, so far, so good. Hey, Mr. Pooch! Mr. Pooch. Well, this is Kevin and Sue's weekend house. It's nice of them to leave us a gun. So, there is life outside New York. You should know... I'm pregnant. Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Just one sip. One sip. You've already had some. Hey! Hey! Mm-mm. Mm-mm. - I put on our song. - I noticed. It's cheesy, but it's nice. I want to have a child with you. Now? With all this? Don't be practical. One of us has to be. Love doesn't have to make sense. Hey, buddy. How's my little man? I love you too, son. Could you put your mom on the line? Hey, Beth. Are you both okay? Beth? Beth? We lost the connection. You don't look like a guy who would pray. You really believe in religion? As much as I believe in anything. What were you praying for? I was praying that God's will be done. Well, let's hope she has good judgment... - Hmm. - And it's going to fix this international crisis. Do you think Chris likes me? What? I know it's crazy to worry about whether a six-year-old boy likes you. Chris? Chris! - Charles! - Chris! It's a dream! Chris is okay. He was in front of me... and he couldn't breathe. And he died in front of me. What if I can't save my own son? How was your walk? It was okay. It's seven o'clock in the morning. So what? We're on vacation. Is that what this is? You know, we're just lucky that they're out of town and we just have to watch the dog. - I'll make us some breakfast. - I'm not hungry. I'm worried about you. If I want to drink any crap first thing in the morning, I'm gonna do it. I'm not one of those boys you used to date who you couldn't trust. I'm here and they're not. I know you're worried about Chris. It sucks that Beth took him to visit his grandparents now. I called again, there are no plane tickets to California. All the airlines are grounded. Maybe we should drive? Which would take five days. The news is clear. Multiple nuclear missiles might hit Los Angeles today... Today. Who are you angry at, Charles? You don't even know who you're angry at. This report just in... The governor of Virginia has been shot. No news yet on if she is still alive. This just in after a mass shooting just outside Washington D.C. I never call myself an artist. I call myself a painter. But, whatever you call it, it's a way of seeing the world. Someone might focus on making as much money as possible, which is okay, but my work is different. It helps me process life. So, today, I paint a nuclear explosion. It's a rehearsal for what may happen later today. It's part of my series about the End of Days, which I hope doesn't happen. But I imagine the unimaginable. I keep trying to call him. The calls won't go through. All the lines are jammed. And your parents? I'm just glad I spoke to them last week. The Russian troops have marched into the city. "These are the words of Christ and they teach us how far we must imitate his life and character. If we seek illumination from all blindness of heart, let it be our most earnest study, therefore, to dwell upon the life of Jesus Christ." So, um, you just try to be as much like Jesus as you can. Even though you know you're going to mess up a lot. Beth has it figured out, a fancy apartment, fancy job, a son. I'm just a painter... with a day job, doing administrative work four days a week. Does it kill my soul? No. You actually make a living writing your novels about people struggling to be moral in an amoral world. Well, I think my readers know... that I'm a man who knows about fear. The fear of... of when you die, nobody will give a shit. That your life has no meaning because you didn't earn millions of dollars... or set the world on fire. You just had a life. They didn't bomb Los Angeles today. So, I... I guess it's a good day. Sorry that took so long. I must have missed breakfast. Eve? The Russians have taken over the city. Tbilisi. They've cut off all the phone service to the West. My parents are liberal, intellectuals, artists. They'll be among the first they'll imprison. I don't know how to wait for bombs to come. Did you get food? There's hardly any. Did you get gas? There's nothing. We have to be really careful where we drive. What has happened to the world? I'm just trying to live my little life, but how can I do that when I don't know if I'll ever see my parents again? And you don't know if you will see your son. Where is your God now, Charles? Eve? Eve! Eve! Eve! Eve! Eve? I lost the baby. Life can be over so quickly. More rioting broke out today in Washington where protests turned violent. Up to two dozen people were killed, several hundred were wounded... It's just been announced... the mayor of Washington has been shot. People are kneeling down and joining hands, they're praying... Turn it off. I wanna go to church. Attention! This is an emergency alert. This is an alert of the Emergency Broadcast System. The Air Force has been deployed over the State Capital in Albany. The Air Force has been deployed over West Point. The Air Force has been deployed over the nuclear power plant in Westchester. The area is at the highest alert. Nuclear bombs are expected to be dropped throughout the Hudson Valley region. It's hard to imagine anything bad happening in such a beautiful place. The news reports said that there will be a massive attack today or tomorrow. Maybe it's better to decide for ourselves rather than wait for the Russians to decide our fate. Maybe we can make a different choice. Outside Poughkeepsie, a short drive away, are the Catskill Mountains. The Hudson River School painted these mountains in the 19th century. It portraits a Romantic landscape where men and nature coexist peacefully. New Yorkers have come here to escape the city for many decades. Maybe that's what we're doing too. The artists believed that beauty was a manifestation of God. I have a dream. What is it? That we do this forever. Where are you taking me? Dancing. We're still alive. You haven't eaten my breakfast yet. Stay indoors! Go into the cellar, this is not a drill! Listen to the radio for orders! Go, go, go! Come on! What's wrong? We lost power. Where are you going? To get more candles and flashlights. Charles! Charles! Mommy? Mommy? Go underground if you can. Go to your basements, bring food and water... We've been informed that you must cover all doors. We've been informed... We've been informed... Cover all doors and windows with heavy plastic. You must remain there for several hours to avoid the worst of nuclear fallout and radiation. Radiation. Radiation. Bring the light! The president is begging the country to remain calm. This is the time to remember what's most important. To hold our loved ones close, tell your family you love them. Are you afraid to die? No, but I've been afraid to live. Maybe we won't die. I have to believe that no matter what happens in this insane world, that it's God's will. I wish I had your faith. You can have it. Isn't it too late? A nuclear bomb has been dropped on West Point. A nuclear bomb has been dropped on the nuclear power plant in Westchester. A nuclear bomb has been dropped on the State Capital on Albany. Eve?
