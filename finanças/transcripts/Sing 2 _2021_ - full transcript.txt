And here she is, folks. The star of our show, Rosita. That's you, baby! The lead role? Trust me, you are perfect for it. Wait till my kids hear about this. And so the story goes like this. Rosita plays an astronaut searching for a missing space explorer. Together, with their trusty robot... - That's me. - Mm-hmm, yes. They follow the trail across four planets. There's a planet of war, a planet of love, a one of despair and one of joy. And each planet will have its own spectacular musical number performed by one of our terrific cast. A-And how does it end? Do I find the explorer? Oh, we have no clue what we're going to do at the end. Gunter, no, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa. We do have great ideas for the ending. We just... All right. We've only got three weeks to make this reality, folks. Let's get to work. Johnny, you are gonna play an alien warrior in a fantastic battle scene. - Yes! - Come with me. Johnny, I want you to meet your fellow dancers. - Hello, lads. - Hey, how you doing? Uh, wait. You said mine was a battle scene. Well, it is, but Gunter saw it as more of a... a dance battle. - Yeah! - Okay... Johnny, don't worry. You're gonna be working with the number one choreographer in Redshore City. "Klaus Kickenklober." Yep. Klaus will turn you into a pro in no time. - Okay. - Uh... Mr. Moon? Meena, you okay? Gunter said I'm in a romantic scene and, uh, uh... I have to kiss someone. Yeah. It's gonna be an amazing, beautiful, romantic scene. Mr. Moon, I've never even had a boyfriend or any of that stuff. Ah, don't you worry. I'm gonna cast a great partner for you. - Promise? - Promise. Mr. Moon, we're ready to start building the rest of the sets and... Okay, okay, okay, listen. I don't exactly know what they are yet, so could you give me one more night to figure this out? Hey, this guy doesn't have it figured out, so we can't start work right now. Mason? - Did everybody hear that? - Hey, don't... He does not have the show figured out. I'm looking into his eyes, - and all I see is fear. - Uh-uh. Mm-mm. Hey, hey, hey, listen, listen... - And a little bit of shame. - Yeah, yeah. Look, I-I think everyone heard you, Mason.

Um, okay, everybody, back to first positions, please. Here, Rosita. You want to try with the helmet this time? Oh, but now I know what the dream meant. Yeah. She's afraid. She'll never be able to play the part. But here I am, and I'm young, and I'm not afraid at all. I-I can't just give you Rosita's part. I mean... Moon, walk with me. What's wrong with you, huh? What, you got a kink in your think? It's just that I wrote this part for Rosita and... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me tell you something, Moon. What you got here is an opportunity to make me happy. And when an opportunity like that comes along, you'd better grab it! You get me? - Uh... - What? You don't think my daughter's good enough for your show? No, Mr. Crystal. Well, I-I think she's wonderful. Oh, good. So you'll figure it out. I'll... Yes, I will. Daddy, I'm hungry for French toast. Jerry! - Yes, sir. - Get her some French toast. And, by the way, I like the set. That whole "rings moving around" thing. Creative, quirky. I like it. Bye, Daddy. Mm-kay. Let's have Porsha measured for a costume right away, please. Yes, right away, people. Would you just get the French toast, Jerry? I'm getting the French toast, Suki. You okay? A little shaky, but I'm okay. Yeah. You know, uh... Look, maybe this is for the best, huh? I mean, you really were scared up there. Right. I'll write you another part, Rosita. A really... a really, really great part. - You all right? - Oh, I'm fine. - Really? - Yes. You're all very sweet, but like Mr. Moon says, this is probably for the best. - Seriously? - Seriously. I am completely fine with this. Hey, honey. Are you... you-you're sure you're not, you know, upset? No, I-I'm good. Um, can I please just have the bathroom to myself - for five minutes? - You got it.

Very good. - Right, right. Well, let me ask you something. What did I do to make you disrespect me, huh? What? Oh, what? You think I'm an idiot? Some kind of bozo? No. No, sir, not at all. My team, they talked to Calloway's lawyer, and they say he's never heard of you or your show. Really? They said that? Uh... - You lied to me! - I-I didn't mean to. Okay? Honestly, I really thought I could get him. No one makes me look like a fool! No one! I-I wouldn't dream of doing that to you.

Don't worry. I know you said he's crazy, but I'll be all right. - Oh, can I go with you, please? - Uh, I don't know. Come on, you're gonna need me. I know everything about this guy. - Uh... I think you're right. - Yes! Now, listen, Gunter, you've got to figure out the ending of this show on your own. - On my own? - Yes. Miss Crawly, I need you to take charge while I'm away. - Yes, sir. - Now, listen to me. You got to bring your A game here, Miss Crawly. I'm serious. You got to be tough. - Yes, I got to be tough. - You got to be firm. Oh, and I got to be firm. Yes. And you cannot... I repeat, cannot... let production fall behind, not one little bit. Is that clear? Yes, sir, Mr. Moon, sir. Mason! That volcano should've been finished yesterday! - W-We're on it, Miss Crawly. - You better be! Meena, Darius, take it from the top, and this time, put a little juice in it, will you? I'm trying my best, Miss Crawly. A little juice? Hey, everybody. You're two hours late for rehearsal! Wait. Wait, where's the koala? Who are you? I'm in charge! That's who! Now, get your tail to wardrobe, sweetheart. Oh, my gosh. There he is. That's him. Holy moly, it really is. He doesn't look so scary. Mr. Calloway! - Go away! - No, please. We-we-we just want to talk to you for one minute. That's all. We are not leaving until you talk to us. Fine. If you're not coming over here, we're coming over to you. No! Stay off the fence! Don't listen to him. Stop, stop, stop! Porsha, you're still messing it up. It's not my fault. He keeps missing the catch. I think she's trying to kill me. Reset. Let's go again. Meena! Darius! We're coming to you next, and I better see some chemistry between you two. Okay, let's run these steps one more time. So, music starts, I step out, do my moves, fancy moves. Step together, drop. Gazing at each other like we're burning up with love... What are you doing with your face? Your face looks broken. What is that? Uh... I was falling in love? Yeah, Gina, listen. I'm sorry, that-that's not what falling in love with me looks like. I... I should know. I see it day after day, week after week. Let's run it again. From the top! And five, six, seven, eight. And one... Would you like some ice cream, ma'am? Or should I say, Your Majesty? Uh... I just... You look like a goddess, and, uh... and-and-and lucky for you, it's "free ice cream for all goddesses" day. Aw. That's cherry cheesecake, and I-I make it all myself. See, my truck's right over there. Come by anytime... Your Majesty. Ooh, that... Are you okay? Buster? You okay? Ash? Where are we? We're in Clay's house. Oh, my gosh. - Have you talked to him yet? - Uh-huh. - You have? - We were just discussing whether he'd consider being in our show. What did he say? He said no. Not in a million years. Please, Mr. Calloway. Look, you don't... you don't realize how much it would mean to have you in our show and... Will you stop your yakking? Here. Your friend left this on my property. And I want you gone in the morning. And that's why they say, "Never meet your heroes." Step, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Yes! Whoa, mate. You're not ready to be busting out these moves. - Sorry. - Look at you. Klaus has thrown you in the deep end and drained out all of your confidence like... Don't worry.

Okay, it's not room service. You and your dumb friends better not be hiding in there. What are we gonna do? Guys, we just got to be brave now. Are you saying we should fight these thugs? No, no.
