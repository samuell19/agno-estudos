- There you go. - Thanks. Want to know the truth? I love this. Walking through those white corridors. The feeling of urgency. The idea that something important has to happen today. - Could you have a look at this? - Sure. My dedicated staff, reading files, my pager. The well-oiled machine called a hospital. Well-oiled. That's what I like. Being a professional woman. - That's so sweet. Thanks. - Some coffee for you. Even the bad hospital coffee. I love it. Here you go. Yes, I even like the little purple cap. That's when I'm in control. And I have to be. After all, I cut people open. I open them up and tinker with their heart. Good morning. Although 'tinkering' doesn't do my work justice. I save human lives. Thank you. And that's what I live for. Scissors and forceps, please. Thanks. My name is Mo, by the way. Short for Monique. This is for you, Mo. It was obvious that I'd become a heart surgeon. I grew up in The Hague with a dad who was also a heart surgeon. Faster now. Come on. A doctor for a father and a villa aren't everything either. - You can do better. - He's too fat. - You can't say that about your brother. - I wish I wouldn't have to. My mother passed away at an early age and so I became the substitute mum. With a childhood like that you don't become a party animal. So I was a virgin until I was twenty. Keep going. Keep going. Jump. Listen, when I say walk, you walk. - Jesus, man. - Jesus, woman. - Don't be so… - Don't be so what? - That. Stop doing that. So rough. - Oh, this bunny can handle it. He'll make it to Christmas, right? And then I met Roderik. I think I… really, you know… like you. After I graduated, Roderik became my regular fix. - Well done and good luck. - Yes. He loved me and I sort of loved him. Duty calls. - And every second counts. - You got it. I managed to stick around for four and a half years. That's quite a long time in this context. Vascular scissors, please. And in my life. My personal best. Just a moment. An emergency. Let's face it, my job is more important. - Current pressure? - 80 over 50. - Hello. - Give it all back. - I save lives. - Specs, please. No further explanation needed. The appreciation is addictive. As a heart surgeon you're a kind of rock star. - Just like my dad was. - Good job, Mo. Like a rock star you fly across the world visiting conferences. It's a kind of Tinder for doctors. During a conference I met Jean-Jacques. May I introduce myself? I'm Jean-Jacques. JJ for intimate friends. JJ is, you guessed it, Canada's best-known heart surgeon. He's from Montreal. He also works in Brussels and then he takes a taxi to The Hague. To see me. And then we get busy. And that he's a bit of a cliché… I can live with that. Oh come on, he doesn't mean it. Stop worrying. Men just want security and excitement, but preferably not with the same person. Why is it my little sister advises me about men and not vice versa? I don't know about heart valves and bosom vibrations. - Fibrillation. - That's what I mean. - Then say so. - I did. - Let's crank it up a bit. - No. In short, I make a lot of money and have an important job. Once a month I have a handsome Canadian in my bed and I live in a place that could feature in any interior design magazine. So… No one can touch me. Hello, I'm Max. I'm Monique. So, you live here? Do you own this place? Yes. The whole place, including downstairs. Cool, I want to talk to you about that. - Do you want to buy it? - No, no, I can't afford that, but… - I'd like to rent it. - Oh, but it's uninhabitable. I know. I've peeked in hundreds of times. Can I explain to you what I'm thinking about? Sure. Explain to me. Inside, I mean. Otherwise I can't explain. It's a long story. So I thought I'd put a kitchen here. A platform for a bed there. And I'd use that to store materials. Hang on, just so I understand this correctly: You're talking about a social work place, but also about a studio, because you're an "artist"? Yes. All of the above. But also about a home, as in "a place to live." And the social work place. I use old construction materials and I make big things. I can't tell you if it's any good, but surprisingly "people" seem to like it. Think about it. And I'll think about it too… Wait a minute. You don't even know how much I'd charge. Not much, right? I mean, you don't use it. And I've got plenty of funding for my social activities. Monique has been chief surgeon for six years. - In her father's footsteps. - If you want to follow his example, you've got at least another 25 years to go. She has your eyes, Gijs. Meindert is chief surgeon at the Erasmus and at the Brussels Academic Hospital. - That's where your friend works. - Yes. I know someone who operates there. - Jean-Jacques Leret. - Ah, the Canadian. - Yes. - Yes, an excellent surgeon. But as a person… I don't know how well you know him, but I think he's a chump. So, a hot guy, marriage material, wants to move in next-door, and you're having doubts? I don't know what to say. He's quite a lot. - A lot? - Yes. - A lot as in "tall"? - That too. Though everyone looks tall next to me. I mean, a lot in all respects. Sounds to me like you should text him to say you'll do it. Yes. Text him right now and say, "I agree, sexy." Fine. Just say you agree, and later on you tell him he's sexy face-to-face. - Hold on, man. - Okay, got it. That's Harm, he's new. That's Steef, from the Schilderswijk. - I thought they would be young-adults. - Well, Faisal is nineteen. Harm and Steef are in their forties. But we can still get it off like teenagers. It's a great space, and not expensive. It's really generous of you. It is generous. As you can see, I'm not a bad person. - Hey, watch out, dickhead. - Shut it. - Cut it out, morons. - He keeps chopping my head off. It was an accident. Drop dead. On parole. All three of them. My studio is part of a resocialisation process for these guys. - You didn't tell me that. - No. You wouldn't have said yes. - That's true, but still… - Okay, next time I'll tell you right away. - Look, a hawfinch. - Where? - Yes, it's a hawfinch. - Where? - You still recognise it, right? - Yes, a specific sound. It's a bit like… The hawfinch will think it has an admirer. Birds don't just sing mating calls. Young birds also call for attention and to communicate with the group, a bit like Facebook. And it's not just male birds that have mating calls, females do too. They sometimes sing exquisitely to court favour. I can't sing. Maybe that's why you haven't been in a serious relationship anymore. You still do it though, don't you? What kind of question is that for a father to ask a daughter? - A straightforward one. - I'm not a nun, but that's all I'll say. I don't mind telling you that since your mother passed away, - I haven't only used it to pee. - Dad, too much information. - Too much? - Yes. As if we discuss this every day. We never do. But that's how it should be, right? Hey, a common whitethroat? That doesn't sound a bit like a whitethroat. I don't know, it's just… I mean, I'll be unconscious for a while. And when I wake up… I just hope it will help. Yes, that's the plan. We'll certainly do our best. This shortness of breath… It's unbearable. I can't do anything. - But you're in good hands. - Yes, Leendert, I know. She's operated on me before. - More than once, right? - I've been in hospitals far too often. I'll never start doing it for fun. - What's the coagulation? - The coagulation is prolonged. - Shall we administer extra protamine? - Good idea. Keep going. Watch it. - Want to see something? - See something? - Yes, do you want to see my work? - Sure. Careful, lift it over. - I call this one The Traffic Cop. - Yes? And this is Alfred the Restless. - Why did you call it that? - Why are you called Monique? Why am I called Max? - How long did it take to make that thing? - Thing? - Sculpture. - About a week. - And.. - Do I ever sell anything, you mean? - Yes. - To be honest, no. But I do regularly sell other things. I sell birdlike objects. There's one in Woerden town hall of all places. - In Woerden? - Yep, Woerden. Cheese City. - Asshole. Knock it off. - Guys. Keep your filthy mitts off me. - Okay. - He lost a fight to a homo. - Are you saying homos can't fight? - No, sir. That's discrimination, you know. Now, sit down. Back to the game. And it's Mister Homo for you. I thought I had an intuition for that kind of thing. How could you have intuition? You have to develop that. I mean, how many men have you even dated? - I can't see anything. Suction, please. - Where? Can't you see where I'm working? Are you okay? - I think I'm hyperventilating. - What makes you think that? I can't breathe deeply, my breath gets stuck. - Does that happen more often? - Sometimes. I'm coming down, alright? Breathe slowly. That's right, into the bag. - That's great. - What a luxury. Getting treated for hyperventilation by a heart surgeon. It's pretty basic. Most grandmas would know what to do. - I'm starting to catch my breath again. - Excellent. - You watch football too? - As a distraction. I often go to see ADO play. You should come too. - You don't happen to have a beer? - No, only a bottle of wine. I don't drink much, certainly not at home. Whatever floats your boat. I hope I didn't startle you just now. - I'm, like… - Yes, I got that. You prefer men. Yes, I'm gay. Gay as a picnic basket. - Do you have a steady partner? - No, I did. - But I'm quite impossible. And you? - You mean, am I impossible too? - No. Are you seeing someone? - Kind of, but he works in Brussels. - For the EU? - No. Just guessing. Does he piss in public wearing a different suit each time? - I'm only joking. Sorry. - That's alright. No problem. - Is he a kind man? - I guess. Yes, more or less. Are you his only one or is he your only one? Answer A is No. Answer B is Yes. That doesn't sound good. Hey, shall we open the wine? - Ooh, I'll have to look for it. - No, no, it's okay. - I'm sorry. - So, he has someone else. - Or does he have more than one? - No, he's married. In Canada. - But the marriage is failing. - According to him. No, it's true. I know. - Are you doing anything this Sunday? - No. - Want to go and see ADO? - What? - ADO. You know what ADO is, right? - Yes, but I've never been to the stadium. There's a first time for everything. You said you're free, so you're going. - Here you go. Hope you like it. - Thanks. Here you go. Nice. Those are for me. Nice. Can you grab the other two? Yes. Run. Yes, yes, yes. Get forward. Keep going, yeah, yeah. Come on. Play the advantage, ref. Fucking homo. - Fucking homo? - It's the culture. Jargon. - You use jargon when you operate, right? - Oh, sure. It's jargon all the way down. Nice going. - Mo, you want something to eat? - No, I'm a vegetarian. - They have cheese snacks. - No, thanks. No chips either? Look. Isn't that sweet? - Yes. - I'd like to have kids too. Or one. A boy, or a girl. There's women's football too. You think I'm joking, but I'd really like that. - Everything's possible these days. - In theory, yes. You start thinking about it after a while. Whether you prefer men, women or animals, your biological clock… Or something like that. It's totally not on my radar. - No? - No. Seriously, no. There's no room for it in my life anyway. So, you'll be wondering why we've gathered you all together. - No, it hadn't crossed my mind. - Diederik, shut up, please. - Don't talk to your big brother like that. - God forbid, Did. - That rhymes. - Let me just put something on. - A little hat. - Just be quiet, son. No one ever saw you And yet you are mine No one ever saw you And yet you're here with me I first knew you existed… - Congratulations. - Did I miss something, guys? - Pregnant. - Oh, pregnant. - Yes, we're pregnant. - You too? Young man. - Congrats to you too. It's wonderful. - Yay, you're going to be a grandad. So this super fit thirty-something is going to start bloating soon. It's for a good cause. It's all very unexpected. It happened so suddenly. How sudden? Not as if the condom ripped or anything, but we weren't exactly trying. How sure are you about Bart-Jan? Whether it's his? Ninety-five percent. Roughly. That's not what I meant. But we'll get to that. About the other five percent… You do have a steady relationship, right? Yes, of course. Totally. Of course, but hey… Life is full of little surprises. So, I had one tiny, or technically one and a half, encounter with an intern. No, wait, he works in the mail room. Anyway, same difference. Listen. If the baby is ginger, then you'll say there's lots of redheads in our family, okay? - In the past, they're all dead now. - Okay, I hear you. And my other question? How's your relationship? - Well… - Okay, have it your way. But seriously, sweetie, I hope with all my heart that it's Bart-Jan's, because the office guy is so stupid. Hey, sisters, voilà. This beverage was made possible by some French hicks who squashed it with their own sweaty feet, but it's truly delicious. Take one. Right, sorry. - I'm driving. - Come on. To the little one, then. Yes. Those lights must have been on for a long time. We call them "warning lights." If a warning light comes on, it means something. It means, "Hello, I'm on. I want to be heard." And then you have it checked. Women can't do all that much after all. That much is obvious. Well, Dad, she's a heart surgeon. Should I be impressed now? My grandfather was a tightrope walker in the circus. Your turn. I agree that's more impressive than a heart surgeon. You see? Smart girl. - Is it the park plugs, perhaps? - Not that smart after all. They're spark plugs, not park plugs. And it's the engine. You managed to cook it dry. She was lucky, wasn't she? That she didn't blow a gasket. So, you're a surgeon? In a way, we've got similar jobs. - What do you mean? - The heart is like the body's engine. - Or am I mistaken? - Dad… Yes, in a way we have similar jobs. - It's probably a busy job, isn't it? - Yes, it is. - Is there also a Mr Mo? - No. - Well, sometimes. - Dad, give her a break, okay? What? I'm just having a little chat. But I get it. No hard questions. Has he talked about wanting kids yet? - She doesn't want that. - I work 60 hours a week, so… He doesn't give up. I think, just be gay and face the consequences. Right? When I heard he liked men, I thought, that sucks. But I'm not one of those guys who thinks he's a jackass because his son is gay. There's one in every family. In my grandfather's family two of nine brothers entered the monastery. No need to tell you more. But at least these days you can talk about it. And Max can do other things. He's got a sculpture in Woerden. Or did you mention that already? Yes, I did. This is going to take a while, so just take her home. Have a girls-only talk. The shortness of breath is better. - Climbing the stairs is hard, though. - But I manage. I couldn't do that before. Now you're being brave. It takes a huge effort to climb the stairs. Come on. I'm 78, what do you expect? And I'm a heart patient. Of course, I don't skip up the stairs like some young athlete anymore. No, but it's nice that it's a little easier now, right? I'm so glad I'm in your capable hands, young lady. I have so much faith in you. I mean it, seriously. - I know you mean it. - And I really feel that you've… added a few years to my life. Nice, thanks. This is Ray, who you have quite scandalously never mentioned to me. There are lots of colleagues I've never mentioned. Well, I shall be fainting at least three times this week for this guy. - So he can give me mouth-to-mouth. - Take it easy. How can you tell so quickly he's gay? Gay men just find each other really quickly. Like short people. When short people see each other, they're like, "Hey, you too?" Then you're like, "Hello." "Hello." Etcetera, etcetera. One thing leads to another if you're lucky. - Can you tell right away if he likes you? - If he likes me? It's not subjective. I am attractive. I'm not really that confident. I don't always think I'm a great catch. I actually think I'm a bit rough. You know, I'm all manly and big. There's not a lot of subtlety. - I feel that way too. - That you're big? I don't think so. - No, unsure of myself. - Really? Well, apparently it affects people like you too. - People like me? - Yes, considering all you've achieved. Everything you are, who you are. And still unsure of yourself. It's quite a challenge to make such a big space homely. - I think I've done a nice job, though. - You've done a wonderful job. - Probably my feminine side. - Who says men can't decorate? Hey, waiting room magazines. - Yes, I take my poses from them. - Thanks. Sometimes I need inspiration for how people stand, sit, lie. - Want to play the magazine game? - What's that? Don't you know the magazine game? That's a tricky one. You're allowed one more try. But you'll find something. It can be on either page. People, animals, objects, anything that if you had to, you could have sex with. - This is a bit sick, right? - Sick, but good fun. - The pilot. - Not the swimming pool guy? - No, it's just his back. - So? No, the pilot. Minus the beard. Nope. Not allowed. It has to be exactly like the photo. - Alright, with the beard then. - Okay. - Your turn. - Okay. An ad for disgusting cheese crackers. Useless. Maybe the hand. But you can't see what's attached to it. No, again. A classic dilemma. Lovely woman, ugly man and two dogs. - Well… - Yes. I guess it'll have to be the lady. Well, then I'll have a gay guy. Would you like to pose for me? - For one of those things? - Yes, for one of those. Nude, of course, but I'll turn up the heating. Why? As if you could tell. You can. For the form, the pose, the inspiration. Otherwise I wouldn't ask. - Are you such a prude? - I'm not a prude at all. Really. I'm a die-hard who still goes topless at the beach. Seriously. - I mean, if it was functional… - It is functional. And I'm queer. - Ray the paramedic does it. - Oh, nicely done. - I'll think about it, if you don't mind. - My turn. It's my sister. Hi. Is something wrong? But you've got a key, haven't you? No, I can never find mine either. But I… He's not answering? No, that doesn't sound… No, I'm on my way. It's my father. He didn't turn up for a trip to Antwerp with my sister. He's not answering his phone and my sister can't get in. I'll take you. Have you got the key? He's not opening up. - This is Max. - Hi, I'm Sam. Dad? Dad? Daddy? He's alive. Call an ambulance. All I can think is he won't be here for the baby, his first grandchild. I understand, sweetie. There's not much anyone can say. We'll have to see what still works and to what degree. Oh, Sammie. He's stable, but that's about it. What can we tell about oxygen damage to the heart, when he comes round? You should probably get some rest. Take a taxi home and lie down. I'll keep you posted. There's not much point in staying here. I'm going to listen, Mr Donkers, okay? I hear an aortic valve stenosis. What's the result of that? The outcome? Well, it's very complicated. Several functions are weak, so the outcome is very difficult to predict. We'll let him be. Ruud has gone through a lot. Pain, shortness of breath. He was no longer the person he wanted to be. All I can say is that the intervention we could do sometimes revitalises the heart. No. It's over. You've done enough. Thank you. I spent years cutting people open, bringing them back to life. As if it was totally normal. But when you end up on the other side yourself… it's as if you're catapulted out of a black hole into reality. It's terrifying. It's a beautiful profession, girl, but there's still so much we don't know. What happens when you decide to stop treating a patient like that? I mean, is that euthanasia? Well, you stop the treatment, yes. Like for this particular man, you stop administering the medication. - Is that what's happened? - It's happening now, as we speak. Listen… The other day after the football match, when you got all serious about kids… Were you trying to tell me something? Well, that was… No. No, okay. Because you told your dad I didn't want that. I thought, as far as I'm aware, he never asked me. Listen, you raise a topic… and if the other person doesn't pick up on it, then… - I'm hungry. - Yes. Yes, I'm in the mood for falafel. I see you're starving too, right? - It probably doesn't even exist. - Maybe… No, no, no. Just when we turn up, famished. - It's two in the morning. - We're still hungry. I've just been boasting about your falafel and your garlic sauce. - I just cleaned the deep fryer. - Your timing is terrible. But must we suffer because of that? - You can get a pita with cheese. - No, we want falafel. What if I make a nice drawing for you? Will you serve us two falafels? - Yes? - Yes. He's the best. Come on. - You can do this too. - Yes, art academy. I wanted to be a sculptor and work with more impressive materials. - Drawing is more for pansies. - Here you go, your falafel. Lovely, Bilal. There you go. - And is it any good? - Do you think it's any good? He looks so angry. Because you're looking sour. That's your own doing. - How long have you been thinking about it? - Ages. Right from the start, when I knew I was a member of the happy sector. - Really? - From the moment… my father said, "Hey, son, never mind. Your brother is normal so he'll take care of the offspring." I straightaway thought, and what about me? - Why can't I have a mini me? - A mini me, yes. It must be something very primal. Unconditional love, I guess. Of a child. Bilal, can I help put the tables and chairs in? - No, never mind, don't bother. - It will only take a minute. There is something down here. It's a boy. - If it was a girl, I'd be just as happy. - Yes, but still… Awesome. Careful, you'll crease my freshly ironed shirt. This is Gene Matching, a dating website for people who want kids. For women and gays? No, women and men in general. What? Yes, men and women who want children. All the data is on it. Height, width, passions, education. Only your IQ and bank details are missing. - That's fascinating. - Anything is possible online. - Come on. - Okay. - Yes. - No, she's not your type. None of them are, they're women. It's about what the combination of a woman and me will result in. This isn't your type, no way. Yes, I like her. Yes, I do. Although, "outdoor sports." I can just imagine you two hiking in the Ardennes in unisex shorts. Don't say that. Now it's stuck in my mind. Swipe. A dark lady. Six foot two, that's a bit too tall. Oh God, what did I tell you? Anything goes. May I have the saw? - I came to say goodbye before I leave. - Nice. Good of you to come. Ray is here too. Hi. Sorry, I'll… Don't worry. It's nice to meet your colleague outside the office. Well, colleague… She's at the top of pyramid. You deliver them, she operates on them… You're a team, right? Without your supply chain, she'd have no one to operate on. Okay, sit up straight. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL BARCELONA Thank you. - That's nice. - Why are you always abroad? Or so often. - Are you teaching them to operate? - I teach and I learn at the same time. Oh, good. We're working on the sculpture Ray modelled for. Look. Say hello to the neighbour, guys. Hey, neighbour. Hello. Not too enthusiastic. Are your students still hanging on to your every word? You bet. Shall I bring one home for you? - When will you be back? - I'm flying out tomorrow. - I'm making lentil soup. - Lovely. You're in luck. Say goodbye to the neighbour properly, guys. - Bye. - Bye, neighbour. See, they can do it. We're missing you. - See you tomorrow. Bye. - Bye. - Welcome on board. - Good morning. - I've come for the soup. - You're back again. - And I have a present for you. - That's sweet. - Did you have a good flight? - Yes. - There is more than enough soup left. - Lovely. This is Marleen, by the way. Hi. Hello, I'm Monique. - You're the neighbour, aren't you? - Yes, I'm the neighbour as well. I'll unwrap your present in a minute. First, some soup. And you're eating it here or you're not having any. Yes, of course, I came for the soup. Because, yes, soup for the neighbour. - How do you know each other? - Well… Max wants children and so do I. Yes, that. Right, that's a personal thing between the two of you. I'll have the soup at home so you can talk about everything to do with the baby. We've already done that. No, just eat your soup. Mo, I haven't unwrapped your present yet. She's about six foot six, chic, elegant. Of course, fucking sexy for a man. - She has him wrapped around her finger. - Hang on, isn't he gay? - Apparently not fanatically. - Come on, Mo, don't be jealous. No, I'm not jealous at all. Really. But I think it's my right that he is honest with me. Get it? As in, "I wanted to have a child with you, but you're old, blubbery and short", and now I have a slim model with great genes, I hope you understand." What are you talking about? - You heard me. - Children? You want his child. I don't know what I want. I was a mother to you, that's fine. I don't necessarily have to reproduce. I'm a very good aunt. I… I wanted to say thank you for your present. I felt a kind of unease. How about Marleen and I come for dinner? - I'll cook. - Why bring her? Has she moved in? No. No, but… Well, we have agreed, as we're doing something so important, that we should spend time together and get to know each other better. - Is she sleeping at your place? - Mo, I'm gay. Conception will take place in a lab. I look at women like I look at diving goggles. So why does she happen to be drop-dead gorgeous? One in 1,000 women looks like that, so there's a 1 in 1,000 chance it's a coincidence. Well, that's the way it is. - Can we come to dinner? - My boyfriend is coming. - The Canadian? - No, one of the 20 others. It's more relaxed for everyone. The better we get on, the smoother it is. We're all just human. Sorry, that's so Mo. When you're lost for words, you go like this. - I don't do that. - Yes, you do. Lovely. Well, that's just great. So you're not even naming it after me. Dad, Gijsbertus isn't a name that will go down well at school. But Gijs will do, Gijs. Nobody calls me Gijsbertus. And Linus… I'm sorry, but what kind of a name is that, Linus? - Perhaps she can make a little Gijs. - If we have to wait for her… I didn't mean it like that. I suppose it won't be my last grandchild, and there's him too. Although… Waiter. Waiter. - How many times must I call him? - Your voice is too low. Let me. - Waiter? - I'll be with you in a sec. - I'll just nip to the toilet. - Shall I go with you, Dad? No way. I'm not an old-age pensioner. - I'm starving. - My apologies, we're very busy. - What will it be? - A beer, please. I'll have a cappuccino, my father wants a macchiato. One, two, three. Okay, let go. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? We don't have a heartbeat. - Okay, we stop. - Stop? Why are we stopping? My father is dying. Don't just stand around. We're going to defibrillate. He needs adrenaline. Grab the pads and hook them up. Intubate him, come on. My father is dying. Why are you just standing there? My father is dying. - Mo, listen to me. - Let go of me, idiot. - Let go of me. - Listen to me. Your dad didn't want to be resuscitated. He signed a statement when he was ill. He didn't want to be resuscitated. Did you know that? Yes. I didn't. Even though we were always… Why didn't he tell me? Because you would have tried to talk him out of it. You wouldn't have left his side for a second. - And he didn't want that. - But I'm not a child anymore. It's very strange. I was always the daughter, "the child of." Now I'm nobody's child anymore. - I'm not really anything anymore. - Mo. Hey, you're all kinds of things. Yes, that's right. All kinds of things, I'm all sorts. You know what? I've got an idea. Do you have any vacation days left? Vacation days? Why? - Thanks. - You're welcome. Thank you. Goodbye. Here it is. Come. Isn't it nice? - Good day. - Good day. - I've booked a room for three days. - In which name, sir? - In the name of Van Gestel. - Van Gestel. - Just the one room? - Why not? Do you snore? Look at that. I'm taking this one, next to the window. In case you cause me to hyperventilate. Well, we'll find out. We certainly will. What are we going to find out? Whether we can put up with each other for three days, just the two of us. In Morocco it's never just the two of you. How did you get the idea of going to Marrakesh? Each year I go to a city whose name starts with the next letter in the alphabet. - Last year it was Leipzig. - Seriously? No, of course not. I've been coming here for years. The first time, I was 18. I just really love this city. Good food, good-looking men, a bit of chaos. - Mister, come play with us. - Come. Just a second. To us. What does whatshername think of you being here with me? - Marleen. - Marleen, I honestly couldn't remember. If you must know, she's not amused. Jealous. A small disadvantage. Never mind, it is what it is. Have you had these peppers before? - No. - At first, they seem very mild, - but after a bit, it's war on your tongue. - So, what now? Shouldn't I eat them? You know what you're in for. - What are you laughing about? - About you. I ask you a serious question about Marleen and you talk over it. Yes, I don't want to talk about it. I want you to have a good time now. I'm merely looking with a photographer's eye. - Yes, that's fine like that. - Thank you. Max, getting back to whatshername, Marleen. Are you sure you want to do this with her? Because when you mentioned her being jealous, - didn't any alarm bells go off? - Nobody's perfect. - How definite is it? - Well, we have an agreement. I've handed in my jar and now I'm waiting for the score. In a way, it's an arranged marriage, but different. But according to the data, she's my match. - Okay, here you go. - Thanks. What do I owe you? There. Keep the change. Thank you. Goodbye. - You pervert, you were openly… - I'm not saying a word. Come on. We're off. - Let's dance. - No. - Yes. - No. Come on. I can't dance. What a whopping big moon. I get the feeling that he's showing off for us. - Normally it's never this big. - You could very well be right. Max? You know, if you had asked me… I mean, if you had asked me directly, or rather, if you were to ask me now, I'm not sure whether I would say no. - You're not sure whether you would say no? - Yes. - No, really? - Isn't it great? - Congratulations. - Yes, you too. That's amazing. Great. Mo! Can I come in, please? - What a mess. - Yes. It has nothing to do with you. I mean… It was already on the cards. Yes, you had told me. So, how do we go from here? I mean… As neighbours, as friends? - I'm not a child anymore. - No, no. No, let's just be practical about it and… Yes. We're not children anymore, are we? Hi. - Bye. - Bye. He takes after me too. Does he? He's really beautiful, isn't he? Yes. You're going to start work in Barcelona? Yes. Why? Why not? GIJS HEEMSTRA, HUSBAND OF HELEEN HEEMSTRA-DE GEUS Just a moment. I'm off. Yes. I knew you were leaving today. First, I thought I'd come and say goodbye, but then I thought… perhaps you'd find it difficult, and perhaps so would I. - I'm not very good at it either. - Who is? - Well, the meter's running, so… - Yes. Not that I want you to leave. I said it more for you, really. - I had better be off then. - Yes. - Have a good time there. - I'm sure I will. Good luck with everything. How do I say that? Stem… - That's what it's called. - Yes, thank you. …until I was seven, and then my parents moved back to Spain. How nice. Where did you live in the Netherlands? - In Nijmegen. - Mo! Who is that? That's Max. I have to ask you something. No, I have to tell you something. Mo… I want to have your child. - He wants to have her baby. - Is he her husband? - Is he your husband? - He's my neighbour. He's her neighbour. What about Marleen and your child? - Does he have a child with someone else? - He's gay. He's gay. Marleen is four months pregnant, but it's not mine. She only tried my semen three months ago. I wasn't the only one. But when I heard that it couldn't be mine, I only felt relieved. She was right. You're stuck with each other for the rest of your life. If I have to be stuck with someone, I want to be stuck with someone I love. Who I love with all my heart. He loves her a lot. Mo, I'm not letting you go anymore. Just listen to me, anyone would think I'm straight. Good morning. Thank you. Yes, scissors and forceps, please. Thank you. Can we switch the music on, guys? I've got something for you. Thank you. I thought this way you can choose what's pleasant. I happen to have something for you too. I don't know how much space you'll need, but… Do you know which one you'll choose? I'd go for that one. - This one. - Yes, it resembles me most. - Cheers. - Cheers. Max! - I'm pregnant. - No. - Yes. - Really? Congratulations. Guys, I'm going to be a dad. She's pregnant. 11 MONTHS LATER Hi, honey. He had a good, long sleep. It's not as if I no longer love the hospital. I still like to save lives. And I'm still fond of scalpels, operating rooms, sterile areas… The well-oiled machine called the operating room. I love it. But life doesn't always have to be a well-oiled machine. That's something I've learned. At the age of 40, no less. There you are. It's even nice when the boat gets rocked a bit. When it's unclear, unpredictable, different, messy, not the way it's supposed to be. Yes, that's what it's supposed to be like sometimes. Not the way it's supposed to be, or the way you thought it was supposed to be. Cheers, everybody. This is what it's all about, isn't it? So, who can touch us? Are you smiling at Daddy? Hello, Gijs. Little Gijs. - I need a large cappuccino. - Rough day? Well, a bypass, some stents, a defibrillation. - Nothing special. No casualties? - No. Well done. We're proud of Mum, aren't we, Gijs? Very proud. - Would you like a drink? - Hello. Definitely hello. I'll have a mint tea, please. - A mint tea. - A cappuccino. Cappuccino for the lady, mint tea for the gentleman. Call me Max. - No, Max, he's definitely not gay. - He smiled at me. That doesn't make him a member of the family. - He's smiling at me again. - Stop it, Max. He isn't. - Like you would know. - I do. Sure, you spotted me right away too. I have a mint tea for Max. Thank you. Two biscuits. And a cappuccino for the lady. - Did you say I didn't know these things? - Okay.
