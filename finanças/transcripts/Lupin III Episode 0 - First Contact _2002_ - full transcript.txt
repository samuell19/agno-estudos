I won. As you promised, you'll have to tell me. Why me? I can't go with Lupin. He just gets too busy trying to seduce me. Nothing gets accomplished with him. I've already decided on the title. It's "Lupin the 3rd: The First Contact." I've already got approvals from a number of publishers. About the encounter, huh... If you think about it, meeting a person can be a big deal. It's like running into your ex in a desert by coincidence, but sometimes, it can change your life like a game. A stray cat. What now? I remember the first thing I called him was 'stray cat.' Let me put on some perfume. I don't need that kind of crap. On you. Are you a stray cat... Or a burglar cat? Draw your gun. Are you sure about that? You'll pay for what you just said. What a quick draw that was. What a swift fellow he is. I'll get you this time. Bastard... What happened in there, Boss? Please say something, Boss. Get rid of him. Yes, sir. Get out of my way! Boss! Please wake up, Boss! Were you asleep or something, Mr. Bodyguard? Is he... What? Who the hell is he? He was the one who's after the Boss's treasure. His name is Lupin. Lupin the 3rd! Lupin? Jigen Daisuke? Right. His black hat and combat magnum... He is a true gunman who's nearly the best among the dark world. So what about him? Nothing really... Thanks a lot, Brad. If he has been hired for Galvez, the task will be tough to beat. Brad, I have no intention of starting a war with Galvez. But, you are interested in his treasure, right? His treasure? The secret within the secrets of Asia... It's Cram of Hermes. Inside a metal tube that is harder than diamonds, there is a... scroll of alchemy that describes how to produce that same metal. Well, it's just a little paradox. Since it supposedly changed the course... of military situations during WWII, the intelligence agents from each country... were seeking for that otherworldly treasure. So Galvez has such an incredible treasure? Not sure about the details, but it's... certain that he had obtained it. You'd never know. From what I hear, recently there was some... moron who got his ass beat by Galvez, when he tried to steal the treasure. Do you know the guy? No, not at all. I guess not. I'll get the treasure. You don't stand a chance. You just wait and see. I got this goddess of fortune on my side. Oh yeah? Later. You should just take a rest for a while. That bastard. So he was waiting for a girl. What do you mean?! Are you going to let Jigen get away for his slip-up? Stop shouting at me. Listen up, Shade. As a matter of fact, you've failed as well. If it weren't for Jigen, the treasure... would've been stolen by now. Boss, you are giving him too much credit. That's it, Shade. No more discussion of this matter. He failed, you know. He doesn't deserve his reputation as the... fastest shooter among the dark world. Don't you have anything to say? You bastard... Shade. Fuck! You're Jigen Daisuke, right? I'm sorry, but it happens that if we kill you, our reputations will improve among the dark world. Are you too scared to talk or something? Get lost, you punk. I'm in a bad mood. Asshole! Oh no. What? It's hard for me to sleep without a woman. Lupin! What business would the Galvez's cleaning... service have at an hour like this? Shut up and give back the treasure. The treasure? Wait, I still haven't... Don't fool with me! There is no one else who can't break open that electric lock. It has been broken open? That bastard... I see. I guess we're looking for someone else then. Die, Lupin. Cleaners getting cleaned... What irony. What the? Did we get him? That son of a bitch. Brad! Brad! Hey, Brad! Brad! Brad! Wake up, Brad! Lupin... Lupin. Who did this to you? Ever since I was a kid, I had a thing... for the sundown of this town... But today it looks totally blured... Brad. Brad! Brad! Brad!! Hold it there. I can be impatient. Well then, let me get a glimpse of your face... Ms. Fujiko Mine. I don't reckon inviting you into this room. I see. No doubt that Brad was crazy about you. Brad? Who could it be? Did you happen to forget your boyfriend's name? I can't bother remembering all the names of men I've dumped. Okay. Then what is this? Cram of Hermes... It's the treasure that Brad had stolen. It was concealed in this room. Don't tell me you don't know. Where's Brad? Let me see Brad. Tired of being stuck in this hellish part of the world, he had left his hometown by the sea and everything else behind... By entrusting his dream in that skyscraper over the sea. I'm not interested in your story from the past. Where is Brad? He's here... Right in front of your eyes. Right in front of my eyes? Even though he was a rival in business to... me, I could not hate the son of a bitch. However, his goddess of fortune put a hole in him this time. Are you trying to say that I killed him? How ridiculous! Is it? If what you're saying were true, I would've... taken off with the treasure by now. It happens that the treasure has a little secret to it. It was arranged in a way that it won't open without a special key. I guess you didn't know. So what's the problem? How would a death of one man or two make any difference? Did you get close to Brad just to steal this? You're such a simple-minded man. Can you even shoot a woman? I guess it's not my problem... But this one is his loot. Your name is Fujiko, right? The thugs from the organization are bloodthirsty for it. You probably want to run as soon as possible. I've been assigned the case of Fujiko Mine, the domestic fugitive by the Metropolitan Police Department. I'm Inspector Zenigata. Welcome, Mr. Zenigata. I'm the director of the state police, Crawford. This way. We've prepared you a welcoming party. A party? I even got some good looking girls for you. Oh my... I'm just... Dear customer... I don't know if I should... Okay, if you insist... Please wake up, dear customer... This plane has landed a while ago. What? I came all the way from Japan and no one came to welcome me. Please hurry up. Okay, okay. I'm coming. Hey, taxi. Could you get the door for me? Hey, are you gonna get the door? Does this seem like a limousine service to you? Can't you see I have my hands full? Hey, there! Oh my god! Damn you, how dare you condescend a Japanese police officer. Are we there yet? It's a stop sign! Drug dealing openly in the middle of the day is unacceptable. Stay right here. Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going? At least, shut the door! Let me see that bag. Who the hell are you? I told you to show me. Shut the fuck up! You, shit... I'm Zenigata from the Japanese... no, from the Metropolitan Police Department. Don't you forget that. You, idiot! Those men you cuffed were our undercover agents. That means... Because of you, all the effort we've put in our... undercover investigation for months has been ruined. I acted by following my instinct as a police officer. If so, then you should've come visited me first. Then, I wouldn't be fit for detective work. Shut up!! This is America. Do not act without my permission. While you are here, you'd better follow our rules, got it? - Director. - What? I've a favor to ask. What's that? May I request the information regarding... my investigation as well as an assistant? Right. There has been an official demand for... cooperation from the Metropolitan Police Department. Don't worry. We've got you a special elite officer. Thank you, sir. Come in. What is this place? It seems like a file storage. This is your work place. This is the best place for acquiring... information regarding foreign fugitives. No, wait. You should let me speak to people at the crime scene first. Nobody has that much free time. Wait... ouch. Get over it. There is no use in arguing with the director. Just don't cause any more trouble, please. You are? My name is George McFly. I was asked to be your assistant. Please to meet you. I guess this isn't the one. Where could it possibly be? Master! What? Okay, we're leaving soon. Yes. We've finally found her. You're hurting me. Can't you be more gentle? Good job, Shade. No. I told you not to touch my hair. How dare you give us trouble? Hmm? I remember you were...? She's Brad's girlfriend. I see. So that's what it is. Without the key, it's just a piece of junk. Don't you worry, dear. We'll soon get the key. Boss! You, bitch. I have the original. This is from Lupin the 3rd. Lupin? I see. So he's Lupin the 3rd. How dare you patronize us? Spill it out. Where is Lupin? Is it your job to figure that out? That's too bad. My job is to kill. If you kill me then the treasure will be Lupin's for good. I ain't gonna kill you. But instead, I'll cripple your body so you... will never be able to go out public again! W-Wait. What did you mean by the treasure will be Lupin's? Lupin is also after the key, so after he gets the key, we could steal the whole package from him. Do you mean you could pull that off? I'm the only one who can steal his heart. What do you want with us? She is the one who tricked us! As long as you'd set me free, I'll be satisfied. Interesting. Fine then. Boss. Hey! You, bitch. I thought I was the last resort. You are? Didn't I tell you to run right away? So what happened? Galvez told me to return the treasure... And he sexually molested me all night long. I envy him... No, what a despicable creature he is. Sorry, I... Where are you going? Hold on... You shouldn't move yet. I wouldn't want to trouble you. That's fine. I expect you to return a favor... No... Basically, it was my fault. Don't worry about it. I can see... anyway, you should change your cloths quickly. Where is the size double D? You're so nice. Why does it feel like I've known you from long ago? That's strange. So do I. Please, Lupin. I'll be back after a quick shower. What a player. Hambargar? That's right. Don't make me repeat myself. Hambargar? I'm asking you to give me that 'Hambargar.' What's hambargar? 'Hambargar' means 'Hamburger.' Hambargyar. Hey, manager. Fine. Forget it. Can I get a burger? Oh, yes. Should I get just one? Get me 10 burgers. And two coffees. You pay for your own food. Hey, wait. I don't need the change. You didn't pay enough. Doh! Fujiko Mine. Both her age and nationality are unknown. She was involved in robberies of more 100... valuable arts, precious metals, and jewelries... And currently, she has fled overseas. What a woman. Now that I'm here, it's only a matter of time before I arrest her. Man, you eat a lot. If I don't eat well, I won't have enough strength to do my job. You don't need any physical strength for gathering information. Shut up. You won't get good results like that. I got my own way of doing things. Is everyone in Japan so dedicated to one's work? How come you are happy-go-lucky? Are you going to take this seriously? Time to work again. I got my own way of doing things. What's wrong? Oh, so you've found the key. The owner is called Hans Dalahyde. On the outside, he may be the president of a trading company, but in fact, he's got ties to a smuggling organization. He is a millionaire who's also known to be a big art collector. To us, he's our prey. When will you do it? It would be too boring if we just steal it. "Lupin the 3rd." No. Take an extreme caution. Don't let the media know about our affair. There has been another warning note about a theft. Another warning note? Here is the copy of it. He even sent one to the state police station. Let me see... At 9pm tomorrow, I'll steal the otherworldly treasure from the... Dalahyde trading company. Sincerely, Lupin... Lupin the 3rd. But isn't this going to cause more racket? That's probably what he wants. What kind of a person is he? Bastard... If you're interested, then we can check his record. Do you know anything about Lupin? Come on, we're in the file storage. Lupin has left the warning note. The time has come. Anyhow, our work will begin after Lupin makes his move. I don't like it one bit. Wait. We've paid you a large sum of money. You better stop acting without our permission. I do as I wish. I take no orders. Are you quitting on us? We also have ideas. Interesting. Could you show me your ideas? That's enough. Just let him do what he wants. But... Forget it. You won't be able to handle him. Anyway, Jigen. Are you gonna run away from Lupin? Run away? Running away? We'll assume as so if you won't finish Lupin. Do you want to be known as a losing dog for the rest of your life? What the hell are you doing? I wanted to drive around with you. I could still put a big hole in your chest from this position. I could as well. What a waste... A man like you working as a mafia's dog? If I'm a dog, then you're a monkey. You know, Jigen. I had a hunch when I first saw you. That you are not well suited for an organization. What are you trying say? After all, we are very similar. You're an overly friendly fellow. Plus, your timing is bad. I've just made a promise... That I will kill you. Finally, tomorrow is the day. It's useless for you to come here. I've already told everything I know to them. After we finish, what would the organization do to Lupin? I'm the one who's going to kill Lupin. All men are stupid. Why do you get all worked up? It's none of your business. Hey, why don't we team up? We can outsmart both Lupin and the organization. Because I've always thought of you as... I'm only competing with Lupin. If you interfere, I won't hesitate to kill you. Chicken shit. Do you think you'll beat Lupin? Of course, I'll win. I must be able to hear... Hearing the sound of a flute and a weeping voice of the great sword seeking its true master... That warning note was asking for a... challenge to the state police station. If we failed to arrest Lupin, we'll be a... laughing stock within the whole country. Do not disgrace the name of the state. We must put a stop to Lupin's crime and arrest him. Listen up, everyone. America is... Director... Stop that... Please take me with you. What the hell do you want? I thought I told you not to let anyone else in! Within Lupin's affiliates, we found a person called Fujiko Mine. So what? To avoid a public disturbance, we'll... keep our guard undisclosed tonight. We don't need someone rowdy as you around for sure. But... Get him out of here! Director... wait... please let me... Director! A mysterious thief named Lupin who's been stirring up the public, has given a warning for his criminal activity once again. On 9 PM sharp tonight, he had warned... that he would steal a certain... piece of art from the main safe of the Dalahyde trade company. Today, our reporters will live broadcast... the scene by changing the schedule. What the hell is this? Today, our reporters will... live broadcast the scene by changing the schedule. Look. There's director Crawford. The director of the state police has just arrived. Director... Director... Please tell us... Will Lupin proceed with his crime as he has warned us? What kind of plan do you have as the director of the state police? Do you have anything you want to say to Lupin? You shouldn't. Just let me go. What this racket? Wasn't it supposed to be an undisclosed operation? It was Lupin. What? Lupin has also sent warning notes to the media. He keeps on pissing me off more and more. Director Crawford. Do you have a time for press conference? There is no time for that. But the Mayor is expecting for you. What? The Mayor is? Yes, correct. Right in here, sir. In there? Currently, the Mayor is in the make up room. Why not do yours as well? Sure. Let me through. I'm a cop. No, you can't, without permission from the director. But, I must... I said no... Have you had enough? If you hang around here, you'll be scolded by the director again. I can't overlook this after coming all the way over here. Isn't there any other way to get into the building? Don't be ridiculous. Come on now. This isn't a place for people to pass through. Follow me! Not a chance. Hmm? Is that it? It seems like it's noisy outside but... Crawford, I also have many outstanding guards. I don't need these heavy securities. No, Mr. Dalahyde. It's our duty to protect the innocent citizens. I have a lot of old friends in the state police. You know what will happen if you fail. There's no worry, sir. There isn't even a tiny crack that a mouse could get through. I hope so. Is that Lupin? What the hell do you think you're doing? You're not being very careful. There is nobody guarding the path... from the sewer through the air vent. - What? - Hey! Yes, sir. Mr. Crawford. Can you explain this? Yes, ew... he is... I'm Inspector Zenigata from Japan. Please let me cooperate. Yeah, that's right. Zenigameh is a truly reliable man. That's enough. Having more guards won't help at this point. Watch this. This is... This safe has been specially... configured so that only I can open it. Furthermore, the thickness of the metal plate is 20 inches. It's thick enough to block a cannon attack from a tank. Don't you get it? Even without you people, Lupin won't even be able to scratch it. Only a minute away from the crime warning... It seems like a notorious Lupin has given up. No, he'll definitely show up. Lupin is that kind of man. It's just a rumor. Come now, Lupin the 3rd. It's that time. I guess he had given up as I expected. An urgent situation... The lights of the Dalahyde building are... being turned off one after another. Calm down. Stay at your positions. Oh, the safe seems to be untouched. This voice is... Good evening gentlemen. This is Lupin the 3rd. Hey you, come on out here. As I promised, I took the treasure right at 9PM. What? That's impossible. As you can see, the safe isn't open. Lupin the 3rd makes impossible, possible. That's it. I switched the treasure with a fake one earlier. A fake one? It's only a tape player. Oh, no! It can't be... You mean this is a fake? Okay. Let's have it identified right away. Wait a sec. Where do you intend to carry it, director Crawford? No I mean Lupin the 3rd? What? You mean he is... What do you mean? I was only going to have it identified... I won't be fooled. Lupin is a master of disguise. I was suspicious of you from the beginning. Reveal your true identity, Lupin the 3rd. Doesn't that mean you are the most suspicious one? What? You have forcibly broken in here... and have found the tape player, and plus you're holding onto that physical evidence... Did you set that player up yourself? Don't be ridiculous. In other words, he is Lupin! Arrest him! Damn it, I'm not Lupin. Inspector, is that...? Fire! Lupin's over that way. Hurry! Yeah! Lupin! Lupin the 3rd! Lupin the 3rd is flying in the night sky effortlessly. Has he succeeded as he had warned? What? Director? Damn you, Lupin! An emergency order to all police vehicles! An emergency order to all patrol vehicles! Lupin the 3rd has escaped from the Dalahyde building. Repeat. Lupin the 3rd has escaped! To all the helicopters on the watch. Currently Lupin is flying... far up in the altitude on a balloon and fleeing northward. Rush immediately to the location. Everyone's hard at work. Hey. Pursue that balloon. But I was ordered by the director to blockade the opposite direction. Shut up... and pursue it. So Lupin's notoriety isn't a hoax. He has deceived the state police splendidly. Wait a minute. If he had carefully planned this, why would he have used a balloon, knowing that there will be helicopters? What's the idea? You had me, Lupin the 3rd. What did you tell me earlier? I told you that the director told me to blockade the path. All the paths were already blockaded before, Lupin. Well done, Inspector Zenigata. Hey, wait! See ya! You've done it, Lupin. Shit. I'll get you. Good work, Lupin. You came out here to welcome me, Boss. That's very decent of you. You've done your best to help us out... and I want to show our appreciation. Don't do it. You've already showed me your appreciation. What? So you knew. I've also got a present for you. 3... 2... 1. Shit. Damn it... after Lupin. Chase after Lupin. It's no use. I won't be hit. Oops. Don't interrupt. You, traitor! It burns, it burns, it burns. This is the climatic end. You're highly skilled as expected. Do you want this treasure that badly? All I want is to end your life. Being popular is tough. Why don't we settle the score once and for all? Fine. I'm ready for it anytime. You go first. I'll do as I wish. Your eyes were used to darkness. You won't be able to do anything for a while. Shit. You're late, Fujiko. Oops. I'm sorry, Lupin. I'll have the treasure. Fujiko, that's harsh. Game over, Lupin. You're a step too late. Fujiko has already taken the treasure. You should worry about your life rather than the treasure. Sure thing. You too, Jigen. Too bad. Did you think you could outsmart us twice? Damn it. How dare you lock me up in such a filthy place? Galvez, you won't get away with this. I'll payback what you've done. Where is the room service? Hey, say something. You're boring me. You're pathetic. What? You're a pathetic fool. What?! You knew Fujiko would backstab you all along. You got burned on purpose. Shut up. All because you wanted to duel at a place like that. Be quiet! I really hate losers and womanizers! I see. As they say, unpopular ones easily get jealous. As an old saying goes, betrayal is like an accessory for a woman. What a crock of shit. I'm going to sleep. Go ahead and sleep. Sleep so that you might become less stubborn. Don't you think it's about time? You're clever enough to figure the way out here, aren't you? You know me well. They didn't leave any guards here. What a stupid bunch. What would you do if I untie those ropes? I will kill you. You probably would. For the time being, why don't we call it a truce for tonight? What do you think? I see. That's a good idea. Now, the contract has been signed. I refuse. What? I don't want to cooperate with my enemy just to save my life. Who cares whether I'm your enemy or not at a time like this? Discussing how to escape in a friendly manner? Fujiko. I see. So everything has been calculated. You should've practiced getting through... walls rather than getting out of ropes. Thanks to you, we've got the key to open the treasure. Now, let me have my Cram of Hermes back. What if I say no? Then she will bloom red flowers. Your joke's too much. Don't you know she has betrayed me? Well then, I won't hesitate. Okay, okay. I lose. The stolen item is in a hidden place. You'll guide us to this place later... But for now, it's time to kill off the traitor. Hmm? What's the idea? Lupin. Shoot Jigen with that gun. What? How about it, Jigen? How does it feel to be killed by your rival? You only got one bullet. Don't try anything funny. Jigen, I'm disappointed with you. On the top of failing to kill Lupin, you even betrayed the organization. You are a loser after all... I feel like shit. Go ahead, Lupin. Don't be merciful. Do it, Lupin. Do you want Fujiko to be killed before your eyes? I'll do it. Can't wait for you to die. You, bastard! Hold it. Hey, boss. Don't you want to kill your... enemy before you kill the traitor? It's because I still have to ask you about something. If it's about the location of the treasure, Fujiko knows about it. What now? Or are you too scared to kill me? Alright then. If you want to die that badly, I'll take... care of you first as you have wished. Aim carefully. Boss. Boss, are you okay? Those bastards. What is this sound? Turn the light back on quickly! I came to take the treasure that you possess. Who the hell are you, shithead? I'm Goemon Ishikawa the 13th. Ishikawa... Goemon? Damn you. Do you even know what that is? Well then, let me tell you the real name of this treasure... It's called Zantetsuken. Fire! What a fellow, he blocked all the bullets. My... my treasure... You won't be able to handle this gun. Oh, no. We're trapped. That's the way... Oops. Kill'em... Kill'em all! Don't let them get away. Not even one of them. Take back... Take back my treasure... My treasure... My treasure... My... Bye bye. Fujiko? Get on! How could I be help by someone like you? Just get on. Just drop me off anywhere. What are you mad about? You're very stubborn. Now, you're being even more stubborn. Look. The Federal Reserve Bank... An impregnable fortress that has the... most amount of gold in the world. So what? It's my dream. I can nail it if I do it with you. Let's just give it up. I won't go back until I get some clues. Don't you know we're in crime central, where even a police... gets shot if he's not with a number of police officers? It's the perfect place for Lupin to hide at. But I thought you were after Fujiko Mine. If I arrest Lupin, we'll be... practically arresting Fujiko as well. But hear me out. Even if we do our best here, that... doesn't mean all the crime in this world would vanish. Is that what you think? No... I mean... The stench of cops. I smell cops. You have to pay the entrance fee, if... you want to walk around this town. Of course. I mean this town is like a safari park. Hey, watch it... How exciting. I need to vent out my frustration. Bring it on. There was someone like that 3 blocks away... Just a bunch of big mouths... Hey. Where are you going? I'm continuing my investigation. What do you mean? If you want go home, then go home by yourself. I don't understand. Why? Why are you so dedicated? I don't even know that myself. But isn't that what it takes to be a cop? Did you witness the strength of that sword? Thanks to that, now I know the secret of the key to the treasure. In other words, that sword is another... Cram of Hermes that was made... with the same alchemic technique. Thanks for taking care of me. Hey, wait. Your wounds aren't healed enough yet to... 'The letter of challenge to a duel' Well, what do we have here... At the sunrise, we'll have a duel... over the scroll of alchemy that you have and my Zantetsuken. From Goemon Ishikawa the 13th. That's the guy from the... We'll settle our score as well next time we meet. Why does everyone want to fight? I had enough of this. Who's that? That's Jigen Daisuke. He's an incredibly skillful gunman. Could he be Lupin's partner? No, on a contrary, he's a hired gun for the Galvez family. Plus, that samurai from earlier... Maybe Lupin's not here? Raid and we'll find out. No, you should wait for the reinforcements. What if we lose him before they get here? Hey... Police. Nobody move. Hey, you're Zenigata... You'd better cooperate, Lupin. Shit... Damn you, Lupin the 3rd. That old man never learns. Oh, no... I told you. Shut up... All in nature... There is nothing that this blade cannot cut. What is this all about? Be glad... You'll be deported back to Japan tomorrow. That's ridiculous. We are facing a serious international crisis. Shut up! I can't let you interfere with our investigation anymore. Please take a look at this. I've finally found the trace of Lupin. The trace of Lupin... Garbage... You probably wrote this up yourself. George, back me up. Eh... I mean... Behave yourself in there until tomorrow morning. Director. George, please let me out. I'm sorry but this is it. George. Are you gonna leave it like this? Are you really going to leave it like this? Shut the fuck up! George! You know this isn't right. George! Are you going to be the witness of the duel? I'll be your opponent. Did Lupin ask you to? No, he didn't. I'm indebted with Lupin. I don't kill without a reason. I have one more reason. I'm the one who will get Lupin. Are you ready to throw your life away? Try looking into a mirror and saying that. Out of all the bullets, only one of them scratched you. That one shot could've been my one-way ticket to hell. Bravo! Lupin. That was something, you guys. But let's not fight like savages. You won't be able to figure out which is the real one. Damn you, Lupin. How dare you fool me with such child's play? It's unforgivable! Oh, no... Wait! A magnet, huh. He keeps on coming up with lousy ideas as usual. He's right behind me... Lupin! Shit! Let me out. Shit... Oh... George. You have inspired me to get back in the game. No way! Stop! Everyone look! Wow! When are you going to stop running? You too. Why do you care for this thing? We don't need two Zantetsukens in this world. I see. Well then, let's put an end to this fight. Here I come! It's liquid fuel that combusts when it gets exposed to air. You're supposed to keep your best card until the end, Goemon. Damn you... Jesus! Damn you, Lupin! It's the mercy of a samurai. Here, grab my hand. I don't want any mercy from an enemy. Lupin! Did you? I've been waiting for this moment all along. What? That was the only way to open this. You are the one who taught me the way, Goemon. You're really a dumbfounding bastard. The same to you, Goemon. So you've finally opened the key to the treasure. Thanks to you... And what business do you have with us? Shut up, Lupin. I'm the one who will have the last laugh! Should we go for it? Fire! Fujiko? Thanks for all the hard work, Lupin. I'll hold onto this for you. I see. So you've also brought these guys here... Hey, Fujiko. Can't you go any faster? We're going as fast as we can. Fujiko Mine?! Stop! Stop! We finally meet. Fujiko Mine, I'm arresting you with the charges for numerous accounts. Lupin. If you mess around with me too much, even I could get pissed off, Fujiko. Oh dear. Now there's another one to interfere with our business. No, you're the one who's interfering. Fu... Fujiko? Sorry, Lupin. This is the way it has to be. So you've switched sides from Galvez to Fujiko. If I work under him, I'll end up as... his cleaner for the rest of my life. We had to do this in order to outsmart you. I'm flattered. Did you have to team up with the guy who killed Brad for that? What are you talking about? Don't bullshit me. To shoot through Brad's thick-ass pendant, you would need a gun like yours at least. He was little too resistant. He wouldn't tell us the whereabouts of the woman. Die in pain just like he did. Fujiko. Fujiko. So you did it because... Don't get any ideas. I only did it because... Oh, shit. Get outta here! Oh, the scroll... Wh..what? Now my work here is done. Wait. Are you leaving without defeating him? My path is the path of the sword... If the fate calls for, we might run into each other again. Goodbye, Lupin. Fujiko. Am I going to see you again? I hate womanizers. I'm only interested in you. Lupin... I hate liars even more. I'm not lying. Lupin. You're under arrest. Oh my... You were alive. Hey! Look, George. I've arrested Lupin. Hey, he is... Shit! Damn you, Lupin. Inspector Zenigata. Thanks to you, we were able to bring... down the Galvez's organization. At first sight, I knew you were capable, and my instinct was right. He is Lupin. Arrest Lupin at once. Your mistaken. I'm not Lupin! Lupin the 3rd, huh. I guess we've struck out this time. You mean this is the end for you? That ain't like you. I'm not done yet. If so then, why don't you sign up for ICPO? ICPO? It's International Criminal Police Organization "Interpol". If you have that title, you will be able... to follow him anywhere in this world. I see. You just wait and see. Lupin the 3rd. Even if I have to chase you... to... I'll definitely arrest you someday. Why don't you drive? That's poor service. Now we're even. How can you still say things like that? Why don't we chill out a little? I don't want us to ease up too much. So what are we doing next? Who said we could... I just want to take your hat off someday. What a fantastic story. That's a story from long ago. So what happened to the metal tube that had the treasure inside? Why don't you ease up on your fairy tale? Yeah, really. I'm not such a banal woman. I thought the story was perfect... To seduce a woman, that is. What? How could this be? I almost had it. Sorry. The time's up. How can it be... You mean the story you just told me was... Lupin! Who the... who the hell are you guys?!
