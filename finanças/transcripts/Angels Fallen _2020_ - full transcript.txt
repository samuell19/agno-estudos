Then I saw the Lamb open up one of the seven seals. And I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder. Come. Look. And behold. There was a white horse. The one riding on it had a bow. And a crown was given to him. He went out as a conqueror, so he might conquer. For the great day of their ride has come. And who is able to stand? Another one, Gabriel? Give me two. You know those guys I'm playing pool with? Been here every day this week. Haven't we all? Big tippers. So I don't ask questions. Can I get my usual? Gabriel, my man. Where you been? Warrick. I see you're on the non-sleeping diet. Jesus Christ man, you look like shit. Isn't this a little outside your territory? You my boss now? I've had calls this side of town all week. Dirty martini, no vodka. That's disgusting. I'm on the clock, pal. Hey, I got something for you, Antonio. I bought a six pack off of you last week. New flavor, new formula, just try it. It's decent. I'll put you down for three dozen. It's not in the budget. Whoa. Those are some serious shitkickers, pal. Steel-toe? You wanna find out firsthand? No dude, I'm good. I'm good. See this? Is my business. You ever heard of it? Got Guts? No. Number one demon cleaning crew in the state. Why do demons need to be cleaned? That's funny, man. Here's what it is, see. It's for cleaning up demon guts after they die. Demons don't die. Is that a fact? Yeah. Well that man right there? He would disagree with you. He has killed over one thousand demons himself. You hunt demons? No. Well he's retired now, but he used to. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That's a very expensive bottle. 85 one dollar bills. Watch yourself. You know who you're dealing with? Oh now come on, that's $15 shy of a hundred dollar bill. 85, okay. Here's 85. That's $3 man. Motherfucker. Come on, boys. I turn my back for a second and you change the whole table? Now look. I don't know where you're from. Frankly, I don't give a damn. But where I'm from, we act like a man, and when it's time to pay up, you pay up. Yeah? Well here's a little something to take home to your wifey. Sort him out, boys. Bravo, bravo, bravo. Got your quarter right here, Spinal Tap. See you haven't lost your touch. Michael. What are you doing here? Haven't seen you in 10 years, brother. No hi, how are you? Nice to see you? Hi. How are you? What the hell are you doing here? I came to bring you back to Zersch. No. Hear me out. There's no way in hell I'm going back to that place. Eve would want you to do this. What the fuck did you just say? Hold on! You must have a death wish. Eve's the reason I'm here. What are you talking about? Put me down. Why? I have to show you something. What? I have to show you. Jesus, Gabriel. You wrinkled my shirt, this is Italian silk. Show me. Let's go inside. These appeared yesterday. The four angels. Got on the first plane to come and find you. How do I know those are real? Come on. The marks have been appearing on me since I was eight. You know what they look like. I don't wanna go back into that world. What about Eve's prophecy? Eve lost a lot of blood. She didn't know what she was saying. You really believe that? I don't believe anything anymore. Especially anything coming out of your mouth. Well I assume you still believe in science. What's that? I've been tracking demon movements with my team back in Europe. Started taking on a concentrated formation. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the hell happened here? What the hell? Get out of my way, little man. Whoa. What was that? That was a demon. Well no shit, Dick Tracy. Who let this nimrod prattle over the farm huh? Always a pleasure, Warrick. So where's Antonio? Aw man. The guys playing pool were demons. And they weren't exploding, they were combusting. Well that explains why there's no guts. But this is not good for the demon cleaning business. What did I tell you? What I tell you? What I tell you, it works. What happened? You don't wanna know. Hannah. I'll be right in. Gabriel. Oh my god, I thought I'd never see you again. Well here I am. What are you doing here? Hello Hannah. Michael. How are you? Where did you get that? This just saved someone from a demon attack. What is it? It's a pulse revival elixir. Meaning? It's a herbal compound that, when activated, mimics the chemical reaction to jumpstart the heart. Like a defibrillator. Exactly. What's the activator? It's a chemical that forms when demon poison enters the bloodstream. Are you two hunting again? No. Not yet. What's going on? The angels have landed. You can't be serious. Did you not see them coming? No, I don't scry anymore. They're here. How do you know? They marked me. Okay. So what do you need from me? We want you to come to Europe with us. We need to find them before the demons do. You want me to come with you? We need you. How can you trust me? Okay. I'm ready. Are you sure? Hannah. Hannah! The demon. Is at the square. If it wasn't for my vision, Eve would still be here. Mommy? Hi honey. I am almost done, have you finished your homework? Who's that? This is Gabriel and Michael. They are very old friends of mine. This is my daughter Ivy. Hi. Baby, why don't you grab your things and I'll get ready to leave. Okay. Okay. When are you going? We leave tonight. We have to move quickly. I can't just leave her. What about her father? He's not around. Is there anyone else? My mother. This is an opportunity to give your daughter a life free from demons. She needn't live her life in fear. I don't know. I can assure you she'll be safe while we're gone. I'll assign a team to stand guard 24 hours. Is that really necessary? If it makes you feel more secure, then yes. We can pick you up after Ty. Ty's going? Of course. I don't know. I need to think about it. Mommy. It was really good to see you, Gabriel. Goodbye, Michael. Why did you tell her Ty was going? Because he will. We haven't talked to him yet. Minor detail. We'll get him at his club tonight. It's all your fault. What? She's still angry at you. I told you not to get involved in the first place. It's fine. No. It's not fine. We need Hannah. She'll come around. You don't know that. Where are you going? Nowhere, I'll meet you at Ty's. You know Gabriel, sooner or later we have to come to some kind of conclusion about these conversations. What are you so hesitant about? I don't trust him. Yeah, that makes sense, but that was also a really long time ago. He had one job. To keep Eve safe, and he couldn't even handle that. Yeah, but sometimes you have to turn around and give somebody another chance. Why would I? Wouldn't he do that for you? He's family. No. Just because we have the same father doesn't make us family. Eve was my family. All these years with all this anger. Don't you wanna put it behind you? I've learned to live with the anger. Why change now? Seems like you oughta do something. What do you have to gain by staying here? More drinking, more boozing, more gambling. More isolation. No sense of resolve. I'm content with that. Are you? Why don't you try to explore the other side? Fine. Let's say he's telling the truth and I go. The angels have landed. We failed in our mission to keep the demons contained. How would we even stand a chance against the angels? You have to have faith in yourself. Sometimes small steps are the only way. Say hello to my little friend. Yeah, no. No. You tried that on me and it didn't work. It didn't work? No. You still smoke? I know how this works. I guess maybe you do then. Close your eyes. I'm gonna count backwards from three to one. Three. Two. One. You can open your eyes now. Nothing's changed. How do you know? You got to keep your eyes open and you have to face your fears. Or things are never gonna change. He'll be in the back. Where were you? What held you up? You're lucky I'm here at all. Oh you did not just walk into my club. Stop. These guys right here? They are my boys! Talking about blast from the past! Good to see you guys. Nice place you got here Ty. Not too shabby huh? I'm opening one up in New York this fall. Franchising, baby. Hey, got my own energy drink too. All these years perfecting demon daiquiri has paid off. Oh no man, this shit won't kill you. It gives you a mean buzz though. Maybe it's time to get back into the daiquiri business. Are you saying what I think you're saying? I thought you retired. That's why your team broke up. The angels have landed. Are you sure? You seen them? Not yet. Are you ready to jump back in? Damn. So are you in? Let's do this shit. The team is back. Come on. Fuck this shit. Let's go. Everything all right? Balthazar? You're not real. You're a hallucination. Maybe you're seeing me 'cause you wanna see me. Why would I wanna see you? Because you're seeing other things that aren't real, so you want me to make sense of it. I don't know what's real and what's not anymore. That's because your eyes are opening. You're finally seeing clearly. What the hell does that even mean? That's all up to you pal. Gabriel. When'd you get the stained glass window in? Ages ago when I renovated the second floor, why? No reason. Come on. I wanna introduce you to my team. The Zotian monastery. What are we doing here? You'll see. Guys, this is Dominic. Wow. That's cool. Welcome. Guys, I'd like to introduce you to Lola. Hunter and tracking specialist. This screen is tracking the movement of the demons. On the left side is the demon demographic from last week. This is how they are today. They've shifted since yesterday. We know some of these demon troops serve the angels. We just don't know which ones. How do the demons know where they're going? They don't. It's a magnetic force. Newton's the name, folks! Newton's a specialist of metallurgy and magnetism. Say what? What does that have to do with demon formation? That's a good question. Good question. Remember this one? Huh? I love that... Hey, don't touch! Let's get back to business. Let's say the particles on this board are demons right? Dirty demons. These other ones are angels. These are your meteorites. So the demons are drawn to the chemical composition of the angels. You a scientist? Alchemist. Traditional or new age? Newton, can we stay on track? Track, right, that's right. Okay, so when the angels landed, the meteorites also hit. Is that a coincidence? Coincidence? No coincidence with that. We think it's configuration of tactics. Preparing for battle. So the angels and the meteorites are interchangeable. Correct. That's where you come in. Right. What's your speciality? Hannah's a psychic. Psychic? I'm not psychic exactly. I have visions. So you see things. What sort of things? Places, events. Sometimes they are symbolic. Have you seen anything like this? Huh? These are new. Yeah. These things have... Now listen. When they bite, they puncture. If they puncture, you're dead. Not necessarily. We saw someone come back to life after taking one of Hannah's elixirs. Elixir? What does that mean? Some demons have disappeared off the grid. That's odd. We better get moving. What are you doing? Oh yeah? Here you go. Back at ya. You like that? All right. Can I come in? Hi. Sure. What's that? This is a time release herbal stimulant. When released it counteracts the sedation I go under when I scry. Breaks me out of my trance. Controls how long I stay under for. Why do you have that? I realized the longer I stayed in my visions the more inaccurate they became. I think I got lost in them, so they became convoluted. You figure that out for yourself? It took me two years to develop the formula. Still a work in progress. Why'd you do it? I thought you stopped scrying. I did. But I wanted to make sure if I ever had to do it again, it would be as accurate as possible. And less dangerous. Are you sure you're okay to do this? I'm sure. You two stand guard. Copy. Does this look familiar Hannah? No. Did you see that? What? Something's over there. Lola, you picking anything up? No, nothing. Something is out there. You two stay back. I'm going this way. What's wrong? It's getting colder. Yeah, you're right. That's not good. I always loved it when you got rough with me. Valentina. Hello, darling. What a pleasant surprise. I wouldn't say pleasant. And I'm not surprised. What are you doing here? Last I heard you've gone. What are you talking about? Denounce your faith. Turn in your demon hunting hat. Throw in the towel. There's a difference between not hunting demons and protecting them. But is there really? What is this place? A safe house. Safe house for demons. Isn't that cute. Not as cute as your ragtag team you've got going on down there. Where are the demons? Out to lunch. Okay. Where's the angel? I have no idea... What you're talking about. Goddammit. Hey. Can I see your gun? No. No? What do you mean no? You have your own gun, man. That makes sense. Shh. Let's go. Michael! Uh-uh. I wouldn't do that if I were you. I have many more of those I can release on a whim. Valentina. Been a while, friends! As much as I love a reunion, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. Where is the angel? I told Gabriel already. I have no idea what you are talking about. Come on, Valentina. Hannah had a vision. Oh, and how are those working out for you? I'm gonna ask you one last time. Where is the angel? I told you. I protect demons. Not angels. Have a look yourself. I could put an end to this right now. You could. But you and your friends wouldn't get five feet away from here with my demons on guard, so we are in a little predicament now, aren't we? You wanna do that? I wouldn't be so sure if I were you. You have another option. What's that? Get rid of these losers. And join me. Right. Together, we'll be unstoppable. You don't know what you're missing. I'll take my chances. There's nothing here! Let's go! I'll be back for you. Don't make promises you can't keep. What did V have to say? Nothing much. Who was that? That was Valentina. She used to be part of our team until she switched sides. You failed to see her in your delusion? Vision. Same thing. Why didn't your sensors pick up the demons? The sensors are thermal. Below certain temperatures they don't even show up as great. Could've told us that a little earlier. Come in. Hey. I was wondering, did you see Valentina in your vision? No. I'd have told you guys if I did. Right. Why? What's wrong? I've been looking for her since she left the team. Yeah, well maybe she sensed we were here and summoned us. Could she do that? I don't know. It's been a while since I've done this and now I'm rusty. Why are you really here? I want to talk. Not interested. Please, let me explain. Just do me a favor and stay away from me. I still love you, Hannah. Yeah, well... I don't love you. What are you doing? You? You're here. Recalibrating the artillery. Come again? You hear what I said? No. Recalibrating the artillery, it's a combination of human skeleton and demon interiors, metallic alloys, in order to destroy them all. Whatever you say man. Just tell me what to do and I will get the job done. What do you think? It's not bad. Yeah. Fuck! Fucking shit! I told you not to touch anything! Listen, listen, it's fingerprint activated. You're lucky, you're very lucky. 'Cause the rest of the people that touch that, they have paralysis for the rest of their lives. You're lucky it's Dominic's piece. I have an override. Dominic? Yes. That guy. That guy really does not want me touch his weapon huh? That's right. Don't think about it. Don't even think about it. Where did that come from? I've never seen that. Now that's something I recognize. That belonged to Gabriel. See? No. You'll learn. You'll learn, my friend. Eve. I'm lost. We need to head to Worslock. How do you know? The angel wasn't in the theater. The theater was showing us which direction to go. What do you mean? There's a statue pointing directly towards Worslock. The only way to get there is over Mount Batar. That trail has been closed for years. It's not safe to cross. Can't we go across it? That would take an extra day, possibly two. We don't have that kind of time. No, it's too dangerous. What is this place? It's an isolated town deep in the mountains. Used to be inhabited by demons years ago. We haven't been there, but a few hunters have. I know a second trail straight through the mountain. I haven't used it, but it's possible. Great. That's what we'll take. Michael. Pack it in, team. What's on your staff? It's a serpent. Why is it there? I use it in my rituals. What kind of rituals? Exorcisms. You were an exorcist? Was. I command you demon, get out of that body! I banish you to Hell! I command you demon, get out of that body! Is that why you become hunter? To track down the rest that were free? Something like that. Where did Ty go? He's picking up ammo. What's that? Who's there? Huh? That you demon? Demon! Demon! Demon! There you are! Yeah, demon, yeah! Come on, come on. Let's dance, demon. Come on. Yeah yeah. Hey demon, you dropped something. Boom, one punch with a glass jaw demon! You ain't nothing. Nothing, bro. In approximately three hours there's a dam we can cross. Around that time we'll lose service. We won't be able to track any demons. Or where they might attack us. After that, we can cut through the mountain. Worslock's located somewhere in this canyon. There's no exact coordinates? No. Once we get into the canyon we should be able to locate it. Ready team? Let's do this shit. The dam! The dam is about to collapse! The only other route is a trail over Mount Batar. We'll have to cross caves. No way. It's way too dangerous. We're taking that trail. Hold on guys. I need to stop for a second. You okay? No. I think it's going to storm. What do you mean? Those are some nasty clouds. Those aren't clouds. Dominic! Give me your hand! Give me your hand Dominic! I told you we should not have come this way. And none of you would listen. Lola, we didn't know. No. Because your vision didn't mean shit! And none of you know what you're doing. Where are you going? I'm going back. I'm going around. We need to stay together. I have never asked to be part of this team. And we would've finished this job without them, Michael. You messed up. Lola! Don't follow me. How much longer 'til we get to the other side? 23 clicks. Let's get going before it gets dark. There you go, gentlemen. Thank you. My pleasure. My name's Jem. Hi Jem. Let me know what else I can do for you. Ty. Sorry. Nothing on Worslock. What do you mean? When I ask he either shrugs it off or gives me the runaround. He could be protecting someone. Maybe they're demons. No. Not that one at least. Slipped him a daiquiri and nothing happened. Nice work. They're scared to talk because of the demons. We have to find, hey, maybe you can help us. Do you know which direction Worslock is in? Never heard of it. Is there a place to stay in the area? There's the inn around the back. Guys, I'm exhausted. Gonna call it. I'll check in, see you later? Cheers, bro. I need a room please. This room is good room. This room is also good room. Any room's fine. I'm gonna call it as well, gents. Sunrise? That's the plan. Great. You all right? I'm sad, man. I miss Dominic. He was my brother, my soldier. Should see his face when I put the demon daiquiri to work. That was awesome. It remind me about you and me, when we started out. That instant friendship we had. Getting ourselves into trouble all the time. And getting us out of it. Most of the time. What happened? We had a vision. How we're gonna change the world. Then you disappeared. I can see the spark inside you. You still got it. Order one for me. Just gonna go to bathroom, all right? Sure. I brought you guys some vodka to warm you up. Where did your friend go? He'll be back. You okay? You look down. Wanna talk about it? I'd rather not. Let me see your hands. Interesting. Your heart line is very deep. Your lifeline is weak. Do you wanna go somewhere for a more private reading? I think I better get going. What about your shot? I'm good. Hey. Where did my friend go? I guess it's just me and you now. Be careful. It's strong. Oh yeah? I love strong. I got better stuff in the back. Yeah? Want me to show you? Please. Be my guest. Bring the fresh towel. Ty! Come on! Take her! I think we found our first angel. What happened to you two? Don't ask. I'm not feeling so good. I think I need to sit down. It's a bit hot in here. Oh my god. What's happening? He can't. You can't kill her! Yes I can! Ty, stop! We need them all together. Fuck you, psycho bitch! You think I'm gonna get some fucking crazy angel STD shit? Huh? Probably. Goddammit. You okay? Fucking angel shit! Psycho bitch! I told you it was strong. You wanna see something strong? I'm gonna show you strong. You fuck! Safe to assume we found Worslock. That's definitely the angel. Yeah. Do you think, guys, the angel's gonna try to kill me now? If you weren't such an easy target. Come on man. So what now? We need to figure out where the rest of them are. Hannah, we'll leave you to scry. You tell us what you can. I'll watch guard over her in my room. I need you to get your strength back. That's only the first one. Sorry man. I lost it. It's all right. Come on, you piece of shit. Are you gonna be okay? Yeah. I think so. You're still bleeding. I can do that. I know. I want to. Thank you. Any time. No. Not for that. For not listening to me when I asked you to stay away. When I left before, I had to. For your safety. Believe me. I know. I better get ready for bed. You know where to find me if you need me. Thanks. Goodnight Hannah. Don't fall asleep. Oh god. You again. Wanna talk? Not really. Why didn't you take the shot? I didn't want to. You always want the shot. Yeah, well today I didn't. Take the shot! Take the shot! No! It's Hannah. Come in. How are you holding up? I'm holding. Do you wanna switch? No, thank you. Did you scry? Yeah. I saw a marketplace with a well. There's some villages surrounding Worslock. Did you have Michael check the tracking? No. Not yet. Okay, I'll get with him. You should get some rest. Sure. What's wrong? It's about Ivy. I found a drawing Ivy did at school. It was a a picture of her dad laying on the ground. Dead. He had wings. She has visions too? I don't want her to have to use them like I did. I will do whatever it takes to make sure that doesn't happen. You're not in this alone. I know. I'm really glad you came back into my life. Me too. What happened here? It wasn't like this last week. Speak. Or do you wanna sleep again? Speak! When I got here last week, there were lots of people. There was like a festival or something. People dancing. And then these two guys started fighting over a girl. Things got violent. What do you mean? Everyone started fighting everyone. You mean killing each other. This is Isabelle. Isabelle. Mama! Put her down! Put her down! Come on, put her down! Looks like we found the second angel. Guys? I think we should move, it's not safe here. Come on. Dominic? Dominic! Oh my god, Dominic! How did you... I thought you were a goner. How did you get here? I don't know. You're shaking. You okay? I'm so thirsty. Can I have some water please? Have you seen Michael or the others? No. Looks like there was some activity here. Dom, are you okay? Dominic. Are you all right? Are you okay? I feel dizzy. Would you like some more water? Ty. What? What are you doing? She was hungry, man. I like marshmallows. What? Come on. You told me not to kill her. The girl got to eat. She's not a girl. She's an angel. A demon angel, remember that. Marshmallows. Marshmallow. Keep it in your pants. Marshmallow. You're gonna die. Hey. It's dark. I know. Soon as we sat down to rest you were out cold. I shouldn't have slept that long. Well you needed it. And I needed time to scry. What did it show? Nothing. It didn't work. Has that happened before? No, I don't know what's going on. Hannah, tell him about your theory. What theory? In the bible, they speak of the four horsemen. They were part of the seven seals that came to signify judgment day. Some say that was to be the end of days. Four horsemen, four angels. The white horse brought disease and plague. Think of Jem as the white horse. She poisoned Ty. Exactly. And when we found Isabelle, the town was killing each other. She's the red horse. Who brought war. War. Okay. What are the next two? Black and pale. What's the black one do? Famine. And the pale? Death. Guys, I'm gonna secure the area. How are you gonna do that? Booby traps. You two get some rest. Ty and I will take turns standing guard. Here. Take my long coat. Thank you. Eve and I will take upstairs. Trust me. I'll protect her with my life. Eve. Eve! It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Listen to me. Listen. Four angels will come. Angels? Dark angels. Evil. To lead the demons. And destroy humanity. Eve. I love you, Gabriel. Morning. Morning. You're up early. Yeah, I need to scry again. No luck last night? No, not exactly. It'll come. I'm gonna take a walk. See what the rest of the trail looks like. Okay. What's going on? Isabella Lecter tried to escape. Gabriel. I saw the river in my vision. Hi. What's your name? Are you lost? Where are your parents? Something's wrong. Poor girl. Look at her. Seems like she didn't eat in weeks. This doll is a very very mean doll. Are you hungry? I have some food. Here. Huh? I only packed this yesterday, it's just... Ty, stop! Don't let her touch you, don't let her touch anything! I had a vision. I saw the fourth angel. Where? Hannah, where is it? In the square. There's something else. There was a fifth angel. That can't be right. We can't go back there, the vision wasn't timed. Someone could get killed. We're going. This is it. You guys stay here. I'm going upstairs. Why are you here? I saw the light. The light isn't in the past. It's in the future. You should go back. Hello Gabriel. Here you are. Back where you started. It all comes full circle. Yes it does. And I must thank you for circling all my angels all back home to me. You should have taken me up on my offer. Sorry, milady. There's only room for one. What are you doing? The destiny of the demon takeover was already written. You and I were on the wrong path. I must thank you though. I couldn't have found all the angels on my own. With them, I can lead my own demon army. And have eternal life. I just had to prove my allegiance to him. That was simple. I made a sacrifice. I love you, Gabriel. Don't leave me. No, don't leave me. Eve! Eve, don't! Eve! You killed Eve! Come on. Come on. Come on. I don't only have an army, Gabriel. I have a kingdom. Welcome home. Make yourself comfortable. You're here for eternity. Go ahead. Try me. Let's go! I've been waiting for you. Sure sorry about your loss. Thank you. Did you know Gabriel? Yeah. He was quite a guy. We spent a lot of time together. He was quite a philosopher, believe it or not. Philosopher? Gabriel? Yeah, he was. He had a funny way of looking at life, but not a great way to show it. That's interesting. Yeah. Guess I'm now happy that he's in a better place. What's your name? Balthazar. I'm Hannah. I know. This is for him. Okay. Mommy, look! That's beautiful, Ivy. Don't go too far sweetheart. Okay. I'll never be dead. As long as she's alive.
