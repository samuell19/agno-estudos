Seto Inland Sea With its beautiful scattered islands. The sea, bathed in bright sunlight. Tourists call it the Japanese Mediterranean Sea. The war ended 20 years ago and now everywhere there is peace and quiet. It is as if the shadow of war was forever erased from the hearts of the Japanese people and from the land of Japan. But... is it really the case? Otsushima Island in the Gulf of Tokuyama, Yamaguchi Prefecture. The place where the Japanese Navy trained for suicide torpedo attacks. 10 kilometers from the port of Tokuyama. This island was isolated from all others during the war. To this day, nobody goes there. Kaiten, special military units, were located here. HUMAN TORPEDOES (Ah kaiten tokubetsu kogetikai) OCTOBER 1943 Lieutenant Mishima KURAHASHI ISLAND, HIROSHIMA PREFECTURE, BASE 'P' Ourazaki was on Kurahashi Island which was Base P. A base for developing the Type A submarines was located here. The Type A. That is what these special mini-submarines are called. They became famous during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Their crews consisted of volunteers of naval academy graduates from Otake, who started their service on this base. Seven graduates of the naval academy arriving for duty. LIEUTENANT-COMMANDER ISOZAKI Start work tomorrow, today you should relax! In Otake, you probably diligently studied everything, but I want to warn you. Here it'll be much more difficult. LIEUTENANT-COMMANDER OSATO Who are you? Pardon me, my name is Lt. Mishima. I arrived today from Otake. Lt.-Commander Osato. Nice to meet you. How long will you hold my letter? I'm sorry. It's true. Exactly as your teacher from Otake described you. Really? An excellent student and well-behaved. Calm, but ready to stand up for himself. But you have trouble adapting to different circumstances. What do you say to that? In Otake I also heard about you. Temperamental, extremely talented, confident... And so on... Maybe it's all true, but not quite. I don't smoke. - And drinking? - I don't drink. I want to ask you about something. What do you think about the Type A submarines, on which you will serve? Gorgeous submarines. Of course, there some limits to perfection, but these submarines are the fastest in the world. Last year I also believed that, therefore I asked to be part of this. But Type A submarines are no longer an offensive weapon. Now, they are only good for defense. I don't agree. Think about it. Since the attack on Pearl Harbor, what more have they done? Attacks at Madagascar and at Sydney Harbor? We must train harder. That's something we don't have time for. How much time do you think Japan has left? JUNE 1942, THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY The defeat at Midway. Battles for control of the Solomon Islands continue for over a year. FEBRUARY 1943, EVACUATION OF THE TROOPS FROM GUADALCANAL If everything continues like this, the Japanese fleet will be completely destroyed. No. APRIL 1943, YAMAMOTO, COMMANDER OF THE JAPANESE COMBINED FLEET DIED Not only the Navy, but all of Japan will be destroyed. We must take the initiative and gain an advantage. MAY 1943, DESTRUCTION OF THE GARRISON ON ATTU ISLAND We had no choice. But while the leadership of the fleet's General Staff protects the remnants of the fleet, the situation will perhaps get even worse. JUNE 1943, MOBILIZATION OF ALL STUDENTS DECLARED It is also absurd to talk about the final decisive battle at sea. You can hope all you want, but that doesn't mean it will happen. Before it does, Japan could lose the war. What Japan needs now is a weapon of salvation, which can kill thousands of enemies. What? You never thought about that? Watch out. Anyone who has lived in the same room with Lt.-Commander Osato has ruined their nerves. And lately he looks like a madman. You're right. He seems to be constantly thinking about something. Almost certainly about the human torpedoes. He wants to use this 93 for them. I understand what it is with the Type A subs. To reverse the military situation in our favor, we must do something. I don't know what he's thinking, but he refused all repeated requests to use the weapons. Still, he keeps filing reports. Command doesn't know what to do with him anymore. So what is the Torpedo Type 93? Torpedo Type 93 Torpedo Type 93 is an oxygen torpedo, which the Japanese Navy developed and put into service a lot faster than other countries. The fuel for these torpedoes is pure oxygen. Not only was their effectiveness as a weapon increased, but they also don't leave a trail of bubbles. Explosive charge 500 kg Hundreds of these powerful torpedoes were gathering dust in ammunition warehouses in most Navy ports. This is bad. But now the combat range of our fleet is determined by combat aircraft, not torpedoes. That's true. Destroyers and cruisers can be damaged before the start of the attack; they sink, unable to release their torpedoes. That's why I can't stop proposing it. Using the full potential of the torpedoes Type 93 is only possible if it's done my way. There is no other way! The range is 40 thousand meters, the speed is 36 knots. At 50 knots 22 thousand feet. 500 kg of explosives. A person will direct it to its target. Still, it's probably not easy to submerge and surface, or to change course and speed, if necessary. We are already thinking about these things. Then the use of human torpedoes is limited right now. I know. The idea, of course, is interesting, but... It is still not fully analyzed yet. If necessary, I will use it myself. Alert! Lt.-Commander Osato, we need your help in the search! -What is it, an accident? - Mishima's submarine has not surfaced. Quickly! Mishima? Lt. Mishima ... -Lt.-Commander Osato! -Don't get up. A weight has been lifted from my shoulders. Lt. Mishima, Lt.-Commander Osato saved you. Had he failed, you would already be dead. And if you decide to die, then at least take an enemy ship with you. Lt.-Commander Osato, thank you very much. Finally I realized, that Type A subs are only suitable for the defense of naval ports. Inside them it's impossible to control depth. Once their engines are shut down they can only surface or lie at the bottom of the sea. Lt.-Commander Osato! Let's get the human torpedoes ready for action. I'll help any way I can. Alright. Thanks for the offer. -Will you go with me? -Yes It would be my pleasure. There is only one problem. TECHNICIAN, LIEUTENANT-COMMANDER OGINO If the torpedo is raised from the water, than sea water can get inside the torpedo. It is possible that this could cause an explosion. I knew that already. If you already know that, then let's leave this nonsense for what it is. Lt.-Commander Ogino, are you trying to say that with all the experimental torpedoes in Kure's arsenal it's impossible? I didn't say it's impossible, but we need time. This project should be considered from all perspectives to find an acceptable solution and only then should the torpedoes be produced. This is the work of the technical staff. I've often told you that there is no time! The enemy destroyed the garrisons on the islands of Tarawa and Makin. Island after island, the enemy is getting closer to Japan. Ogino, you can be accused of treason! What!? I offered weapons. I'm ready to act. Work. It's necessary to make this proposal for discussion by the General Staff. I'm begging you. Osato, the commander didn't say you could do this. Maybe we should wait a little longer? All of our proposals are being rejected. What is Command thinking? Lt. Mishima. In this case, we must act. In the winter, I'm going to Tokyo for a holiday. I'll sit in headquarters until I can convince them. GENERAL HEADQUARTERS GENERAL HEADQUARTERS This torpedo, the course of the project, can't change. There's no turning back now. And besides that, it's a mayor innovation. Butâ€¦ It's possible to cope with all of this through special training. I don't think so. Shortcomings will always remain shortcomings. How can you say that? You haven't even seen our training. It's not just about that. I've repeatedly told you that the main problem is there is no way to make an emergency exit from it. Although this is a one-use only weapon, there is no need for suicide. I also thought about the emergency exit. Solving this problem is possible, but the increase of mass needs to be calculated, which decreases the weapon's effectiveness. Therefore, I insist on more research. While the situation on the fronts remains difficult... Don't talk back! Where do you think you are? You are only a Lt.-Commander. How can you understand our plans and strategy? Leave! I won't leave! I'll report to the Chief of Staff. The Chief of Staff, who's also the Minister of the Navy, is very busy! He has no time to meet you. Then I'll wait. How often do I have to say that you are waiting in vain? Don't you understand? You can think whatever you want. Today, I'm going to meet with the Chief of Staff. I'm his adjutant. I told him about you and your request. The Chief of Staff knows everything. Is that not enough for you? No, our latest weapons should be accompanied by a determination to die. It's as if you want to see both sides of the coin. I want to hear from the Chief of Staff himself why a determination to die is so important. Stop making things up! Do you think that if you use your weapon, all our problems will be resolved at once? If we agree to apply it, will it guarantee victory in the war? Of course. I'm sure that when the time comes for me to join the pilots, they will think the same. I believe that. Whatever the case, you can't meet with the Chief of Staff today. Sir, tonight I have to leave Tokyo. If I leave, not having met him, I will kill myself. Report. ADMIRAL SHIMADA, CHIEF OF STAFF - MINISTER OF THE NAVY Lt.-Commander Osato. Up to this point I've repeatedly asked for permission to use the special torpedoes to attack the enemy. However, I'm constantly being rejected. I know that, from the time of Admiral Togo, the Japanese Navy never resorted to planned suicide attacks. Perhaps, I'll be punished for what I'm about to say right now, but given the way how our military situation is evolving, it seems to me that, if we don't use such tools now, Japan will never win. I'm a military man, and I understand what it means to die, saving your country. I am fully convinced that the time for this has come. You might think I'm crazy when I say things like that. But my head is clear. When I think about the fate of our native land, I do go crazy. Maybe that's why I can't stay calm. With all my heart I beg that you allow the use of these weapons. I understand. Osato is your name, isn't it? Be ready. FEBRUARY 1944, AMERICAN FORCES ATTACK THE ISLAND OF TRUK Truk, the main island of the eastern Caroline Islands, is the largest Japanese naval base located on the front. During the air strikes, this base was completely destroyed. Japan lost 325 planes, ships with a total displacement of 240 thousand tons. Fuel, provisions, military supplies, and all the major buildings were destroyed. This base was almost entirely obliterated. That created a major gap in the strategic defensive line and increased the risk posed by the enemy. Lt.-Commander Osato. Banzai! We have permission to use human torpedoes. Finally. How do you know? The Commander just told me about it. It seems that such an order was sent to a shipyard in Kure. We got it. Finally, permission is obtained. We will now have a lot of work to do. We all... have been waiting for... the time when we could use these weapons. The Commander requests your presence. Come. Is something wrong? Nothing. You have something to say? Lt.-Commander Osato, if something is wrong, please tell me. Are you hiding something from me? No. How do I say this? Someday... you too will feel the same way I do now. In early March 1944, the human torpedo was codenamed Weapon 06. TECHNICIAN, LIEUTENANT-COMMANDER ASO In the shipyards of Kure, in a special secret shop the work began on the technical aspects of the project. During March-April, stabilization was tested. After receiving positive results in April, work began on making the first prototype. Work on it was carried out day and night, without any breaks or rest. MISHIMA PROMOTED TO THE RANK OF FIRST LIEUTENANT, AND IZOSAKI TO CAPTAIN 3RD GRADE. -Finally, everything is ready. -Yes. Soon I can go out so sea again. When you use these weapons, I'll cover your back. I very much hope so. Mr. Ogino, I'm sorry that I brought you so much trouble. I take this work very seriously. When you called me a traitor, I had no choice but to try my best. I apologize. Tests of Weapon 06 were carried out in the presence of senior representatives of the General Staff and Submarine Command located in the eastern part of the Strait at Ondo. After passing a series of tests, Weapon 06 has officially been recognized as a weapon of the Navy and got the name "Kaiten". The shipyard in Kure was ordered to begin mass-producing such torpedoes. Furthermore, on Otsushima Island in the Gulf of Tokuyama a second special naval base was created used for training and preparation for combat use of the weapons. For the "Kaiten", the most determined officers and NCOs of the special combat units were selected and trained on the Type A mini-submarines. Also, graduates of the naval academies and students of military academies were selected, andy approved by the Ministry of the Navy. OTSUSHIMA ISLAND BASE As you were! Attention! LIEUTENANT ESHIOKA, LIEUTENANT USHIODA At ease! Lt. Eshioka reports the arrival of seventeen people. We have arrived for duty. Alright. Attention! SERGEANT TAKEI, SERGEANT ASHIZAWA At ease! I report the arrival of twelve people. We have arrived for duty. Alright. Attention! Attention! CAPTAIN 3RD GRADE KATAYAMA, COMMANDER OF THE KAITEN UNIT At ease! I'm Captain 3rd Grade Katayama. By order of Headquarters, I was appointed Commander of the second Kaiten special attack unit. Now I'm responsible for your lives. The situation at the front is very serious. The enemy is waiting for the right moment to be able to attack the main Japanese islands. This fall we place great hopes on you, the crews of the Imperial Navy. All the greatness of our homeland lays on your shoulders. Kaiten is the power of the sun, the power turned to the heavens, the power will lift up the energy rays of the setting sun. All of you will be filled with the spirit of power - Kaiten. Be prepared and be without doubt, as those breakwaters protect us. This should become a part of you. Good luck! Attention! CAPTAIN 2ND GRADE KURIHARA, COMMANDER OF THE 6TH TORPEDO UNIT With very fast preparation, around twenty percent will die. Twenty percent? It's probably necessary. When I turned to them and told them, they all expressed a steadfast determination to die for their country. I guess I'm getting sentimental. However, I felt sorry for them. How I wish for these young men to live. That they won't die as pathetic dogs. I thought a lot about it. I will take care of them. If they accept death, the Japanese people will undoubtedly talk about their pure hearts and steadfast determination. And what will our descendents say about us? About those who devised and set these suicide attacks in motion? Historians of future generations will have to consider this. Even if they decide that we are fiends from hell, we must do everything possible to prepare them. Look very carefully! This will be your graves. What was that? Special attack weapons. They say it's something like the German V1. It's already too late. They can say anything they want. That's why we don't even have planes anymore. Idiot. Aircraft are saved for the last decisive battle. The battle will be great. Don't be a wise guy! Listen! -Do you think that Japan will lose? -Why?! Bastard! Are you saying that Japan will lose the war? How can Japan be defeated? Japan is the divine land. I didn't say that. These are the words from a student from the preparatory courses. What? A student? Attention! What is the name of the student? Lt. Yoshioka has arrived. Step away from the door! -Excuse me! -Excuse me! Bastard, I heard you've said that Japan will lose the war! -I said that. -So what? -You wretch! These are the words of an Imperial Navy officer? Do you want our graduates to be imbued with such a defeatist mood? You didn't have any concept of discipline in your studies! I will personally punish you for this. Spread your legs! Clench your teeth! Get this! Will you able to die peacefully, knowing that Japan could lose the war? I don't want to say this but it's ridiculous to say that I'm not able to die with honor. Don't think too much here! What can someone who has no determination to die do? Lt. Unshod has arrived. What do you want? About the defeat of Japan, it was not Lt. Yoshioka, but I who said it. What? -Why didn't you come forward then? -I... was in the shop. I didn't know that you all gathered here. -Lieutenant Yoshioka! -Yes! You decide what to do with him. - Get him out of here! - Yes, sir! Excuse me! Go. Why did you let them go? These scoundrels must be taught a lesson. -Yes! -Lt.-Commander Osato! -Lt.-Commander... Why do you say such things to the other cadets? They are still children. You have a burning anger in you? You're probably right. I can die at any time. When I think about it, I want to live. Sometimes I have doubts and think that this is inhumane. This is also how many of the students think. They are the only ones that don't pay attention or talk about it. If this wasn't happening to them, they wouldn't be normal. Yoshioka? They beat you? No, everything is all right. Ushioda! Because of people like you, all the officers in the camp are worried. - How dare you! - Well, what do you think? Perhaps I should become like you and imitate the officers? -What are you... -Stop it! -No! We are all going to die. Between the academy and school there is no difference. We are all in the same boat, together with all of them. Come! Got it? When you find an enemy, the submarine will submerge into the water and you should prepare for the attack. When you receive the order to take position, you will get in through this door. After receiving instructions from the captain, you will set the course pointer on the chosen route and start the engine. After the second clamp attaching your torpedo to the submarine is released you will only be retained by the third clamp and the phone cable. You should be ready for launch. At the command of "Ready for launch". "Ready to launch." "Start!" After receiving this command, the submarine's third clamp is released and you will immediately move off. You will have no connection anymore. The rest will depend on what you have learned. -Is that clear? -Yes! Alignment by hand! Turn right! Steering wheel in the middle! - End of the alignment by hand! - Stop! -Turn to the left? -Yes! Turn left! Steering wheel in the middle! End of the alignment by hand! Ready for guidance! Be careful with your hands! Guidance is ready! Steering wheel ready! Control the roll! Faster! Roll at a minimum! Ready to launch! That's it. Who are you? -This is... -This dog? Please don't be angry. It belongs to Yoshioka. Have you been caught? That's a naughty boy. See how he plays. I think this puppy is from a wandering dog. Do you think you can just keep a dog on this base? He came here by himself and I stopped him, in accordance with military regulations. Don't play the prankster! -What's his name? -Hachiko. Like that faithful dog Hachiko? No, it's about a spirit of brotherhood. Brotherhood - is that a name for a dog? Who came up with this strange name? I think that it's very suitable for a military dog. So you came up with this yourself? -You... -Look how nice he is. Take care of him. Lt. Yoshioka, you are not only a vet, but you truly love animals. This is due to the fact that my parents died when I was very young. Mice, rabbits, guinea pigs... abandoned dogs, I always brought these animals home. My brother scolded me for it. That's fine. Once I had ten dogs. And today I have one dog at home. It's not surprising you were blamed for it. My wife's brother also loves animals. And when her brother got angry about them, she secretly took care for them. They say that many women are very fond of animals. You're right. You can say she's like a sister or even a mother to me. And I saw her as my girl, at least, it seemed so. Instead of her parents, she took care of me. I also know a good woman. That's your girl? No, I think of her as my mother. Ushioda, your wife, how is she? An ordinary woman. Ushioda, are you married? I married just before arriving at the base. -Really? -Yes. How I see what's happening to you. Maybe you should be transferred to the technicians? What do you mean? Do you mean that someone who is married can't become a Kaiten torpedo pilot? -Tell me! -Ushioda! SERGEANT TOKUNAGA -Tokunaga! -Sir! Periscope in order? In order. I've personally tested everything. We all rely on you. You are our hope. You can sleep peacefully. I's best not to meddle into other peoples' affairs, right! Lt.-Commander Osato! I would like to address you this afternoon regarding our training on the water. What's the matter? Please allow us also to participate in the training. -Is it possible? -What are you talking about? -You all want this? -Yes! That will not do! You yourself still can't swim. -But... -But what? You cannot finish training until you learn how to swim. The test is our responsibility. During August, we will receive a hundred new Kaiten. Then we'll put you in one, and if you want it or not, send you straight to heaven. You will have to wait until then. So hot. -Give me one. -Here! -Me too. It burns! It burns! Bastards! Who allowed you to do this here? -Now what? -Yes! It's Takei. -Takei! -Yes! Father was called up. Now he is somewhere in China. -No mother either? -No! She died three years ago from lung disease. My younger brother works in the fields with my grandparents. These people are like those who I grew up with. This is not the first time you've run away from the barracks to help them? Yes! Weekends too. -Weekends aren't meant for this. -Yes! Okay, I get it. This time, I will not report you to the commander. Bur remember, if this happens again, you won't escape punishment. -You're free to go. -Sergeant Takei, please allow me to go! Okay. What else? You object to my decision? No. But... We are promised that in August, a hundred torpedoes would be made. We have only three now. The difference is obvious. We were also promised that there would be more training on the water. This could affect their morale. I perfectly understand you, but I can't do anything about it. Continue training on the three that we already have! -Captain. -No. We thought we could make at least ten, but we could make only five. Lack of materials, not enough production capacity, transportation problems. We lack all of these things. Despite the plan and the time limit, it didn't work out. On the other hand, we have a very good repair service at our disposal. Concentrate fully on the training. Commander! You seriously want that? This way, you only support us when the enemy attacks Japan. Silence! How will you fight, if you start crying in front of each obstacle? Obstacles must be overcome. You're free to go! At what time do you meet with Lt.-Commander Osato? We agreed to dine together. But it's noon already. That's right, he could come any minute now. Despite that fact that today is a normal day, I arrived from Kure today, so he will definitely come. He always says that he has a lot of work to do. If I can't meet him, I have to wait several more months. Excellent. The third one has surfaced. I looks like it's going to rain. Let's go back! Well, how did it go? There are high waves in the gulf. Made the torpedo nearly uncontrollable on the surface. We had to dive to 13 meters. We were just drenched in cold sweat. We should finish up today. Well, no. We can continue. The same training. The enemy will not wait until the waves subside. The waves are high. I cancel the exercise. Commander! Let me continue. If you easily give up because of such waves, in real combat they won't be able to do what is necessary. Commander! Alright. Continue as planned. But only in the gulf. Who will go next? Second lieutenant Watabiki has a stomach ache since yesterday evening. He's in sick-bay now. I'd like one of the officers from the camp to go. All right. Lt. Yoshioda, are you ready? Yes. Really? Are you sure? Please allow me. -All right. Go! -Yes, sir. Lt.-Commander Osato. Don't worry. We'll be back. -Are you ready? -Yes! Letâ€™s begin! TIME PASSED: 50 MINUTES It's already been more than an hour. That's suspicious. They exceeded the scheduled surfacing time long ago. -Hold your course! -Yes, sir! Commander! Anything? We searched for them all along their course but never found them. Okay. Report this to base and expand the search. Do it! -You called for me? -Yes. I think I'll go home now. I guess he won't come. Although I waited so long for him. But it seems that he has some important things to do. I don't doubt that. I'm already used to that. It makes no sense to wait. -You found them? -No. Now what? -What about you? -Nothing! You still haven't found them? Yoshioka... Continue the search! Lt.-Commander Osato. Raise it. Lt.-Commander Osato. Lt.-Commander Osato. It was my fault. I did not prepare the torpedo well! September 6, 1944 Report on the loss of Kaiten number one. The time was 18 hours and 12 minutes when the torpedo, controlled by Lt. Yoshioka, together with Lt.-Commander Osato, sunk. Next, I will analyze the situation as a whole, together with some additional observations. The accident proceeded as follows: On that day, I accompanied Lt. Yoshioka during the torpedo control exercise, which took place in Tokuyama Bay. We left at 11:40 and headed towards Sadzima Island. At 18:00 we turned left to 180 degrees. Heading to the port crane on Otsushima Island... At 18:10 the speed was 20 knots. Suddenly we felt we were rolling down. When we looked at the inclinometer, we found that it had achieved maximum roll. The roll exceeded fifteen degrees. We apologize that we couldn't save His Majesty's weapon. As a first test of the crew, we didn't succeed. We apologize for our actions. The air supply was depleted. I ask Lieutenant Mishima to take care of my affairs. I would really like that he becomes a decent officer. I wish courage and strength to all the other pilots of Weapon 06. I can hardly breathe; my thoughts are confused. My hands and feet go numb. At 04:00 death appeared. Suddenly, I felt in good spirits. Together with Lt. Yoshioka, we cheered the Emperor three times. Lt. Yoshioka is dying quietly. I'll try to be like him. At 06:00, we were both still alive. Our feelings didn't change. Banzai! Sergeant Major Tokunaga, is everything clear to you? The cause of the accident was not bad technical training. I believe that Lt.-Commander Osato was confident about the torpedo. Senior Lieutenant Mishima! Lt.-Commander Osato! You... Back on Base P, you saved me. Why did you die before me? Our weapons are secret. We can't even send his family the usual death notice. He should have stopped the exercise on time. It's a pity but they can't come to collect his ashes. We will consider what can be done. Is there a package for Lt. Yoshioka? It came yesterday afternoon. In the package was a hat. The hat was to prevent him from hurting his head on the periscope. The wife of his brother sent it. But he never wore hats. Let those who lived with him take care of his things. FOR HORIUCHI KIKU SAVINGS BOOK He suddenly was assigned to a another job. A secret job. He said that he would not be able to meet you. He asked me to thank you for everything. This means... ...that he died. No. It's not that. Since I stopped working as a geisha and began to work in a factory, he was always trying to give me money, because we needed it so badly. But I always refused. I didn't want him to support me with his money. And then one day he said to me: "I opened an account in your name. If I die, then at least take this money." I knew from the beginning, about the fact that he will die soon. "We must do everything we can to die heroically for our country." All the time I only thought about this one thing. I thought it was just drunken chatter, but he deliberately said that and then kept quiet. Of course, he was tormented because his death was not only his, but was connected with the death of many others. It's possible that it was the only thing he was thinking about. That's what he thought. No one understood this. No one, but me. But in the end death comes to us all. The spirit of Lt.-Commander Osato will keep us safe. We're not going to stop and simplify our training. Lt.-Commander Osato will always be remembered as a pilot of the Kaiten torpedoes. All pilots of the Kaiten are obliged to you. Training. Training. The Kaiten divisions were obsessed with only one thought. How to fulfill their duty as soon as possible for the Admiral of the Fleet and His Majesty. -Lieutenant Ushioda! -Yes! You're on leave, but you don't go anywhere? It's so noisy among the civilians. I can rest better when I can look at the sea alone. You're talking about me too... you're thinking about us. That we haven't gone into action yet but are nevertheless arrogant and cruel monsters. That's not it. No need to hide it. No, I thought that way in the past. But we all almost have become like a family. The difference between you and us lies in the fact that we have taught ourselves how to die, while you teach yourself how to live. So be it. Two pieces can create a whole. Am I wrong? The military way of thinking about life and death is not suitable for everyone, but you aren't wrong. You shouldn't comment on everything! By the way, how's your wife doing? So-so. Lt.-Commander Osato used to say that he who loves his wife loves his country. I love her! He was a good man. Pride of what will put you inside the torpedo the grief that you will perish... When I think about what he said, I have the impression that he put these feelings in all of us. He once said that when the time comes I will feel the same way he did. OCTOBER 1944, ENEMY LANDINGS ON LEYTE ISLAND The battle for the Philippines was a decisive event in the outcome of the war. 100 B-29 BOMBERS RAID WESTERN KYUSHU Enemy aircraft brought destruction to Japanese cities. In preparation of further suicide attacks and after rigorous training... a special division from Shikishima carried out an attack on an enemy ship... by ten Kaiten. At the same time, the equipment for launching the Kaiten subs ran out. In late October an order came from the General Staff of the Combined Fleet to prepare a plan for special attacks using Kaiten torpedoes. Based on this plan, the Sixth Fleet developed a new strategy. A meeting was held on "Tsukushi Maru", a docked ship in Kure, where the formation of a special torpedo attack base in Kikushui was announced. The commander of boat 47, Captain 3rd grade Isozaki Kentaro. Crew: Lt. Sikuya Mishima, Lieutenant Ushioda Katsumi, Sergeant Misahiko Ashizawa, Sergeant Hajime Takei. VICE-ADMIRAL SHIGEYOSHI MIWA, COMMANDER OF THE SIXTH FLEET The goal of our plan is to take advantage on the enemy units that are attacking the Philippines. We will conduct a surprise attack against the enemy ships at the West Caroline Islands. Our goal is to destroy them. For maximum camouflage, a moonless night was chosen. The exact time of the attack - November 20th, at dawn. Submarines I-36 and I-47 will attack at Ulithi. Submarine I-37 will attack in the Kanal Von Kossol at Palau. Based on information received today more than a hundred vessels are anchored in Ulithi. We have also found out that about fifty ships are anchored in the Kanal Von Kossol. A few days before the attack, on November 3rd, team members of the special attack fleet are granted a leave. At ease! You only have one day. Nothing could be done for those who live far way. But for those who live near Kyoto and Osaka, airplanes were prepared, standing by at the Shidske base. I demanded that you should be taken on board. Take this last opportunity to see your relatives. I hope I don't have to repeat that you can't mention your mission and our secret weapon. Don't say anything to anyone. Understood? Questions? Concerning Sergeants Ashizawa and Takei. Ashizawa is from Chiba. Takei is from Fukuoka. They will remain here. I know this and have considered what to do. So Wamakatsu and Oasu will take care of their relatives. -Spend the day with them. -I'm very grateful for this. It will make things easier for me. At ease! -Lieutenant Ushioda! -Yes! Lieutenants Yoshioka's house is in Hikone, right? Yes, on the outskirts of Hikone. Can you give me the address? Yes. I want to go there on my way back. OSAKA Faster, faster! Setsuya! Mother! I'm home. You came after all. This morning, I had a premonition that you would come back today. Well, come, come. Father, Setsuya is here! Father! So you're home. Are you behaving yourself out there? Yes, I got a leave. I just arrived. Glad to see you. Well, you see. My hunch wasn't wrong. Okay, stop boasting and instead make tea. Father, do you have many responsibilities? Teachers now have to do different work. It's obvious there is a the lack of people everywhere right now. Now I have to write what kind of work the students do in the factories, and then write a report on this. The war reflects badly on all of us. True. Recently, I read an article in the newspaper about special kamikaze attack units. What, victory can't be achieved by any other means? However this is war, nothing can be done, But the young people are a treasure. Can they not appreciate this? Father, you're confusing Setsuya with all your talking. Ration cigarettes. Want a smoke? Mother, can you cook me rice with red beans? I would be happy to eat your rice and beans. You cook better than anyone else in the world. I already knew. Waiting for your return, I was holding the beans ready. -Will Takei stay for the night? -I think so. And he will take my sister as a wife? Don't concern yourself with that. I came without warning. Don't be angry. I'm not angry. When will you go... into battle? Everyone's so quiet. Not at all. Well now, I cooked rice for you, but you won't even touch it. No, no, I'm eating. I'm no longer a child. I can't be full. Thanks, Father... Can you also pour me some? So you learned how to drink? I want to try it. Only today. Mother, also pour some for yourself. I can't. Then my heart will pound very hard. A little bit, okay? Will you drink? Just for today. Please, have a drink. KYOTO It's not working! Nothing I do seems to work. This is because you haven't played for a long time. The fingers aren't moving. A seaman who plays the violin, that's nice to look at. Okay, We'll go. Katsumi, have a good night. Good night. Good night. -Have a good night. -You, too! You've changed. You think so? You look harsher. Soldiers have such faces. No. You will be sent somewhere? Yes. Tomorrow, I would like to go to Shisendo. Will you come with me? Don't be silly. I won't be sent anywhere. But maybe one day I will be. Katsumi! Etsuko. Maybe Setsuya came to say goodbye to us? I had the same feeling. But I'm ready for this. That he will never return. Maybe he even isn't alive anymore. I felt it more than once. Recently, when I cleaned out the closet, I found an essay he wrote in third grade. It was about three heroes who sacrificed themselves. I remember this essay. "Someday in the future I want to die the same way they did, for their country ." He wrote that, didn't he? Yes. "To become a soldier means to die in battle for your country." I have a feeling that we, the teachers, taught the children this. OUTSKIRTS OF HIKONE Come! Come in! We saw off a war recruit. Please, come inside. Thank you, I don't have much time. If you don't mind, I will sit here. I only came to see how you are. Are you feeling well? Yes, everything is alright. Sorry, but will Keiji get leave in the near future? Yes. Everyone goes on leave sometime. Keiji has probably changed a lot. He has, of course, turned into a fine military man. Yes. An excellent officer. Everyone respects and trusts him. He was so carefree, has he really changed that much? From childhood, he was always very nice. Very fond of animals. He brought stray dogs home all the time. No one knew what to do with all of them. He brought several to us. He also told me about that. Kumo! Kumo! Only this one remains. He's old. Kumo is not Keiji. He does not hear very well and is almost blind. When he sees someone similar to Keiji, he thinks it's him. He remembers how he once came home. What happened? Tell me. Did something happen to Keiji? If something happened, then please tell us. Don't try to hide anything from us. I beg you. After he became a sailor, we prepared ourselves for the worst. Please excuse me. I can't tell you. I wish I could, but it's strictly prohibited. But I... No, we all will... fight for Yoshioka. I promise you this. Dear brother. Madam. I promise you that. I want to give this to you. Take it with you. And think of me. Thank you. I have nothing to give in return. Don't be offended. I will not forget that you came to me. Do you think I'll forget about you? Please take the amulet. Don't be angry. Thank you very much. It's very important to me. I'm obliged to you. What are you talking about? Obliged? It's like I have one son more. And it pleases me very much. Maybe you want something else? If so, tell me. Just one thing. I would like this very much. What is it? Tell me. It will not be possible. It's not so easy to get. It's a white scarf. What is this scarf? Do you mean a muffler? Not a muffler! It's a piece of fabric that pilots tie around their neck. Made of white silk. It's useless. Getting white silk these days is almost impossible. It's all gone. The government regulates all sales of fabric. Do you know where you can try and find this? You see that I don't have any merchandise left. I have nothing to sell now. I'm sorry. I would have been happy to help you. Where are you from? From Tokuyama. From so far way. I see. Madam, please wait a minute. Here, take this. But this is just between us. I found it with some difficulty, stored away for the marriage of my daughter. But I think that she doesn't really need it now. I'm very grateful to you. The soldier will be overjoyed. I'm so grateful to you. I'm very indebted to you. â™ª You and I, we... â™ª Listen, is there a celebration here? It's all so sudden. It's Katayama and his comrades. Captain 2nd grade Katayama? â™ª Our torpedo bases are like flowers in the gardens. â™ª â™ª Our torpedo bases are like flowers in the gardens. â™ª â™ª Flowers that blossomed will one day fall off. â™ª â™ª For our country, we will fall together. â™ª â™ª We are joined â™ª â™ª together like two cherries. â™ª â™ª And when we say goodbye â™ª â™ª and fall, â™ª â™ª then again a year later, â™ª â™ª in April we will meet â™ª â™ª in Kuranju, â™ª â™ª where the sakura are blown around. â™ª Look. That is exactly what I need! Thank you, Oasa! Call me "Mother"! Mother. Thank you. Mother, thank you for your help. The day after tomorrow at nine in the morning... Could you go to the beach and say a prayer for us? At nine o'clock? Okay. -What is that? Look at this. -Wow. I also want this. -I also want this. -Wait a minute. Look! Wow. I see you're all here. Thank you for everything. Take care of those that remain. â™ª Bid farewell to country and â™ª â™ª go on a long journey. â™ª â™ª I'll lie down in the â™ª â™ª waves of the Pacific. â™ª â™ª The waves will hide the stars and the moon, â™ª â™ª which I have beheld. â™ª â™ª As well as mountains and â™ª â™ª rivers in my native village. â™ª â™ª I beg you, â™ª â™ª forgive me, mother. â™ª â™ª For when we parted in silence at night. â™ª â™ª I was bound by a firm oath, â™ª â™ª that we must win. â™ª â™ª Donâ€™t be angry because I'm so stubborn, â™ª â™ª but I must hit the road. â™ª â™ª I will go to the Yasukuni shrine. â™ª Mother! â™ª Goodbye Mother, â™ª â™ª take care of yourself... â™ª Ashizawa, you're only seventeen. Mother. â™ª I will go to the Yasukuni shrine. â™ª â™ª Farewell mother, and â™ª â™ª take care of yourself. â™ª How to express it in words? The time will come when you will feel the same as me. Lt.-Commander Osato! The day of the military campaign that you waited for so long, has finally come. You too have come? Lt. Ushioda, when you go in for the attack, take Yoshioka with you. Okay. In the afternoon, of November 7th, 1944 there was a ritual, during which the sailors of the Kaiten special torpedo strike unit Kikusui were awarded daggers by the Commander of the Naval Forces. The ritual was performed on the Okushima base. Now I will hand you the daggers, which were sent by the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet. Navy Lieutenant Satsuya Mishima! Here! The next day, the eighth, at eight o'clock in the morning... â™ª With you â™ª â™ª we have grown together â™ª â™ª like two cherries. â™ª â™ª Our torpedo bases are like â™ª â™ª flowers in the gardens. â™ª â™ª Flowers that blossomed â™ª â™ª will one day fall off. â™ª â™ª For our country, we will fall together â™ª â™ª We are joined â™ª â™ª together like two cherries... â™ª Good luck! Hold on! Try your best. â™ª See you in April, â™ª â™ª next year... â™ª -I'm relying on you! -Yes! â™ª In Kuranyu, â™ª â™ª where sakura are blown around. â™ª Attention! At ease! Salute! Mishima! Forward! Hold on! We depend on you. -Thanks for everything. -And you, too. Mother! Mother! I'm going! Takei! Takei! Takei! Takei! Takei! Takei! Takei! The Kaiten special torpedo strike unit Kikusui crossed the Kuroshio Current and navigated to the south. Submarine I-37 to the Kanal Von Kossol in Palau. Submarine I-36 to the anchorage north of the Ulithi Atoll. Submarine I-47 arrived at the same place from the south. We are close to the island! No one is in the line of sight. 21 degrees to the right. I confirm! A warship! 51 degrees to the right. Probably a warship, deadweight around 6.000 tons. I confirm! A carrier. About 8.000 meters. 7 degrees to the left. It's a large squadron of ships. A warship anchorage. You've all seen the locations of the anchored ships. It doesn't appear that they suspect anything. We proceed according to plan. Take your place in the torpedoes and get ready to attack! From the bottom of my heart, I want you to demonstrate the power of the Kaiten. Good luck in battle to the officers and the crew of submarine I-47. I thank the Commander of the Fleet, the Chief of Staff, and everyone from the Okushima base. To your places! We must do everything right! Let us do our duty! -Takei! -Ashizawa! -Good luck! -Yes! -Go on! -Yes! Senior Lieutenant Mishima, take me with Lt.-Commander Osato. -I beg you! -Don't talk nonsense! If you go with me, who will work on the torpedoes at the base? But, Senior Lieutenant Mishima... I rely on you! Close the hatch. Close the hatch more quickly! Yes, sir. Thank you for everything. Take care! Good luck! Number one is ready. The hatch is closed! Number three is ready. The hatch is closed! Number two is ready! The hatch is closed! Lt.-Commander Osato, we'll go with you. I will go after you. Mishima, I'm happy for you. We will both stay together for all eternity. Forever. Number one, get ready to launch! Ready to launch! Ready! Ready! Launch! Lt.-Commander Osato, we are going! Number three, get ready to launch. Ready! Launch! All torpedoes are on the right course. Long live the Emperor! Banzai! Mother! I confirm that the first ship has been sunk! I confirm that the second ship has been sunk! â™ª We are at war at sea, â™ª â™ª and therefore let the water take us in. â™ª â™ª So be it... â™ª November 20, 1944 4 o'clock in the morning. We managed to sink three aircraft carriers and two other warships. Among the losses was submarine I-37 that hasn't returned. â™ª Flower, that hastened to dissolve, â™ª â™ª only wishes that â™ª â™ª the leaves will fall off. â™ª KAITEN END
