Nestor crittenden, that's with two ts. Tell you exactly how I did it. With a straight-edge razor. When I catch 'em breaking the lord's commandments, that's what I do, I rip 'em with the razor. You gonna stick me in jail, huh, huh? Not today, nestor. We're full up today, come back next week. Stupid flatfoot! Never tell you nothing again! It's no wonder you never catch nobody! Jerry, don't do that. What's new Leo, you on to something? The captain issued a statement, didn't you get it? Come on, I could fart a better statement than that. Are we friends or not? I won't quote you directly. What? You won't quote me? You won't mention my name on the TV? And you call yourself my friend? That's not nice, Leo. Jerry, I'm not a nice person. I'm a mean, selfish, son of a bitch. I know you want a story, but I want a killer, and what I want comes first. Bye, now. Don't wait up for me. Have fun. Hil Where are we going? Back to the lake, I hope. - Hi, Fran. - Hi. Is it as good as they say? If you don't like it, just ask for your money back. - Will we get our money back? - No way. Wouldn't by any chance know her name, would you? Not by any chance, no. It's Tina, why? Nothing chanced, nothing gained. This is like my fifth time that I've seen this movie. I haven't even seen it. = you've never seen it? You're gonna die when you see Robert redford, he's so gorgeous! I like Paul Newman. = Tina? Say hi to Warren Stacy. Hi, Warren, how are you? Fine, thank you, Tina. Hot buttered popcorn? Would you mind sitting somewhere else? No indeed, wouldn't mind at all. Rather sit here. Popcorn? Now look what you've done. Shame on you. Don't go away mad. What the hell? Warren, don't hurt me. Why me, Warren I'll do anything for you. - Oh! - Oh, god, come on. No, he's so cute. - Don't even look at him. - He's cute, though. No hard feelings, I hope. Wanna bet? Come on, don't be like that. Let's start over. You don't like popcorn. How about a drink? And don't tell me you're not old enough. We're old enough, we're just not that hard up for company. = wait a minute. He's only trying to be friendly. So, what did you have in mind? Forget it. I wouldn't want to come between you and your girlfriend. Good night, sweethearts. Don't do anything I couldn't do better. Charlie! Charlie, come here, over here. Take a look! Who discovered the body? - Is there any suspects? - No comment at this time. Do you know who they are, can you give us their names? No, we're going to withhold identification till the families have been notified. Were they both naked? How were they killed? Look, anything I might say to you without further investigation would be purely speculation. = that's mine. What? The chewing gum, I dropped it there. Mcann, Paul mcann. Well, it's not a very propitious way to meet, is it? You might say that. Mcann, you know better than to throw things around when we're looking for evidence. I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking. I see you've already met. Yup. Well, let's get on with it. Come on. Come on. What do you notice about the m.O., Leo? That girl that was killed last Christmas Eve, Lorraine partridge? Right, same scene. Well, captain Malone and I hold the theory that the boy was incidental. It's obviously the girl the killer was after. Boy just had the misfortune to be with her. = misfortune? In the case of both victims, death was caused by the severing of the intestines and the major arteries, causing massive hemorrhaging. This is all all right, but can you tell us something that we can use? Well, the Johnson girl's blood type is the least common. Ab negative. In addition, there's evidence of a hepatitis infection, now dormant. Was this girl raped, doc? There's no evidence of forcible entry. I could have told you that, you know. = on the basis of what? Well, if anybody does something like this, his knife has gotta be his penis. Karen, where's Betty? = I'm sure she'll be here soon. I guess maybe she overslept. You guess, maybe? Don't you and Betty live together? Yes, but sometimes she spends the night with a friend. A friend? When she comes in, I want to see her. What is it, Warren? This is Karen's typewriter. Well, put it down. Yes, ma'am. Works fine now. Just needed some cleaning. = thanks. = you're welcome. If I need you, I'll call you. I guess maybe she should change her sleeping habits, huh? Would you mind your own damn business? What do I care? If she screws around and loses her job, what's that to me? Go away, Warren. Who is this? What are you saying? Oh, no! Oh, my god, no! Betty's dead! What happened? No! Nol I spent five years as a patrol cop. All that time, I thought I'd learn to adjust to almost anything. It's funny, this sort of thing, the personal stuff. I don't know, I suppose in time you become inured. Become what? Able to face the parents of a girl who's been butchered. Well, you just don't let your feelings become involved. You're only there for the information. You smoke? Not anymore. If you were smart, you'd quit, too. I know, it's a filthy habit. Hazardous to your health, offensive to everyone around you. Have I left anything out? You know, sometimes you talk like you should've been a school teacher. That's not surprising. My father was professor of social psychology, Berkeley. Oh, yeah? And you're a cop? Lieutenant, I don't think you have a low regard for cops. What I do think is you regard me as a profound pain in the ass. Finally said something I agree with. I'll try and raise my level of performance. = that shouldn't be too hard. Ah, what do you know, I used to live in this neighborhood. That building over there was once a drugstore. You know, the owner was hooked on morphine. His wife tried to have him put away, so he killed her. The jury found him temporarily insane. Six months in the nuthouse and he was pronounced cured. A week later, he shot his parole officer. You sure this is the right street? Yeah, it's the right address. Mr. and Mrs. f.L. Johnson. Oh, jeez! What's the matter, you know them? God, yes! Their daughter and my daughter, they were friends. God! No, you wait here. - Would it be better if I... - No, wait here. I don't believe it, Leo. It's good to see you. Hey Marge, come here, Margie. Oh, excuse my appearance, I work on the night shift now. I just got up. Look who's here. = Leo Kessler! Good lord, look at you! You haven't changed a bit. How long has it been? What is it, Leo? = can we talk inside? = come in. What's wrong, what is it? "Don't let your feelings become involved." Jesus, can't you drive any faster? Before, whatever his name is, Dale Anders, who else? She dated a lot of fellas. Never a night somebody didn't call up. What are the names of the guys she went to bed with? I wish we didn't have to ask this, Karen, but we're looking for a motive. All the names you can remember. Before Dale, there was Larry Williams, lew Porter, George latham. And there was this guy who she didn't go to bed with, but who called up all the time. He was Mexican or something. He, every once in a while, he'd say something in Spanish. = what's his hame? He'd never say his name. All he called up for was to... You know, talk dirty. He talk dirty to both of you? Uh-uh, just to Betty. Maybe you ought to start checking out these names. Find out if any of them spoke Spanish. All right, lieutenant. Thank you, Karen. Karen, I know this is hard on you, but I'd like you to show me Betty's possessions. Everything. I hope you won't, you know, make her look cheap. She wasn't, honestly. If only you'd known her. = t knew her. "And though this body be destroyed, yet shall I see god, "whom I shall see for myself "and mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger. "We brought nothing into this world, "and it is certain we can carry nothing out. "The lord gave, and the lord hath taken away. "Blessed be the name of the lord. "Unto almighty god we commend the soul "of our sister departed. "And we commit her body to the ground. "Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. "In sure and certain hope "of the resurrection unto eternal life. "Through our lord, Jesus Christ. "Amen." Thank you very much. - Hello, sweetheart. - Hi, daddy. How are you? How am I? I'm sick, because... It wasn't so long ago that she was my best friend. Look, have you found out anything or am I not supposed to ask that? Well, me and mcann here, we're working on it. This is Paul mcann, my daughter Laurie. - Hi. - Hi, how do you do? Excuse me, see you in a minute. Are you a cop? Well, so they tell me. You don't look like a cop. Your father seems to be of the same opinion. You don't sound like a cop, either. Ah, is that good or bad? Actually, I didn't say if it was good or bad. I just said you don't look like a cop and you don't sound like a cop. Do you live with your father? = no. When my mother died, he and I kind of went our separate ways. I'm a student nurse. Really, you don't look like a nurse. And what's a nurse supposed to look like? You take after your father, don't you? = you think so? Ti don't. Excuse me. Nice talking to you, miss Kessler. Thanks for coming. Anything at all to report? No, nothing, but we'll get him, I promise you. I thought of something, it could be important. Betty always kept a diary, everything she ever did. Everybody she ever went out with. Too many! Some of 'em were... Excuse me, don't I know you? Do you? Well, uh... I'm Laurie Kessler, haven't we met before? Have we? Maybe not. I thought of something. It could be important. Betty always kept a diary. Everything she ever did, everybody she ever went out with. - Hello? - Hi, Karen. Hi, Tim. How are you bearing up? Oh, I'm a wreck. I can't sleep and I can't stop crying. I'm coming over to take you out. You're a darling. I just don't feel like going anywhere, though. I think I'll just get a bite to eat here and try to get some rest. Why don't you come over in a couple hours? - All right. - Ok? Ok, that's perfect. You're an angel. Bye. Mr. Stacy? Lieutenant Kessler, detective mcann. Can we talk to you? Come in, please. Didn't I see you at the funeral? Yup, and we saw you. Been shopping, have you? You're very observant. 1-Sam-4-0, 1-Sam-4-0... What's that? Oh, sorry. Miracle of modern science. Sit down, please. I'll just put these things away. This is a nice place, how long have you lived here? About a year. It appears you're something of a movie buff. I try to see everything worthwhile. You're into karate, are you? It helps keep me in shape. Yeah, nothing takes the place of regular exercise, does it? I see you keep yourself informed. It's not often someone you know personally gets murdered. How well did you know her? Same as the other girls in the office. = you ever take her out? = once. Why only once? She wasn't my type. We've talked to just about everybody that went out with her. Maybe you can shed some light on what we learned. What's that? This is Betty's diary. We got it from her roommate. She kept what you might call a graphic record of her experiences. For instance, "so conceited that when he said, "did I want to go to bed with him, "it was like he was doing me a favor." That's Larry Williams, you know him? = no. "Always talking about his corvette and cabin cruiser, "but never once bothered to mention having a wife." George latham, you know him? = no. "Good-looking, but what a creep. "Makes my skin crawl, I told him to get lost. "Creep called me up again. "Creep asked me to the office picnic. "I said I had a date, he said I was lying, that made me mad. "I said I wouldn't go with him "if he was the last man alive." You know who that is? I'll give you a hint. You. They say one shouldn't speak ill of the dead, but the truth is, she was not a nice person. No morals at all, and terrible manners. Well, I know what you mean. A man can only take so much abuse before he strikes back. = that's not what I mean. Where were you on the night of the 6th? = at the arrow theater. Well, Betty Johnson was murdered on the night of the 7th. I assumed you meant the night of the murder. Anybody see you there? = the cashier. The manager. A couple of girls I talked to. What was the movie? Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid. Ah, the one with Newman and McQueen? = Newman and redford. Shall I tell you the rest of the cast? What it's about? Nah, that's not necessary. These are games we play with just about everybody. Nothing personal. Can I use your bathroom? Help yourself. Ah, this is first-rate. Boy, that's beautiful color. I've never seen a bullfight, have you? A couple. Where, in Mexico? Tijuana. Are they really as gory as people say? Not if you think of it as a spectacle. I suppose that's a valid point of view. Shouldn't be so quick to judge, right? After all, football is a fairly brutal sport. Boxing. Nothing very elevating about two gorillas beating each other to a pulp, is there? Oh, this corrida de... Corrida de toros. Yeah, what's that mean? It means bullfight. You speak Spanish, huh? = a little. 3-I-99, 3-l-99, phone the station. Ah, may I use your telephone? = of course. Detective mcann. Lieutenant? Kessler. - Karen smalley. - Who? Pretty girl, the one Betty Johnson lived with. - Where? - The apartment. I'll meet you there. Sorry to bother you, thanks for your help. = that's ok. If there's anything I can do. This is detective mcann, he'll take you downtown, get your statement Tim, we're gonna need one. = t didn't do it! Christ almighty, she was my girl. I know you didn't do it, Tim. All right Tim, let's go. This where you found the diary? Yeah. You figure that's what he was looking for? Yeah, and I got a pretty strong hunch who it was. After the funeral, you went from the cemetery to the market. I did. But you didn't get home until three hours after the funeral. Now, that's a hell of a long time to spend in the market. Are you telling me or asking me? Warren, you were informed of your right to remain silent. Now, you agreed to answer questions. He's not asking questions, he's making charges. Only my office, the da's office, can bring charges. You haven't been charged with anything. I'll ask the question simpler. Where did you go after the funeral? = t went for a walk. Oh, you went for a walk. Why? I was upset, I felt bad. = about what? When someone you know is murdered, maybe you feel good. I don't, I feel bad. Even about a girl who was such a bad person? No morals, no manners? Warren, you ever been arrested? = no. You ever taken to juvenile court? For breaking your neighbor's window and throwing a dead animal inside. A cat? I was 12 years old. Stupid thing to do, but I was angry. I'd been punished. Oh, sure, sure, for hurting the neighbor's daughter. You cut her with a knife. = it was an accident! You like hurting girls? = t won't answer that. T won't stand for more! = look at him. That's the fellow you saw, and you're sure? Yes, of course. What was he wearing? A red jacket and jeans. Designer jeans, he looked very neat. He was repulsive. When did you see him? Outside, before the movie, and then when he sat down by me. By us. And afterward, on the way out. You saw this guy before, during, and after the movie. You sure about that? - Yes, I'm positive. - Yeah. Did you ever take her out, Warren? I drove her to work a few times, that's all. Just not your type, huh? Her boyfriend objected, so I stopped. The girls you talked to in the movie theater, were they your type? No. Thanks kids, you can go home now. When's the last time you made it with a girl, Warren? That's none of your... Last week, last month, last year? = t refuse to answer. Never! You've never made it with a girl, because girls won't have anything to do with you. But you get back at them, don't you? Betty and Karen, and god knows how many more. I won't listen to your filth! I won't listen... What's this, Warren? Warren, do you recognize this? - Leo, knock it off! - What's that, Warren? You ever see ohne of these before? What's it used for? What's the matter, cat got your tongue? It's for jacking off, isn't it? And these pictures, you recognize the girls on the pictures, Warren? Look at them. Look at them, Warren, look at them! Leo, stop it! Hey, hey, hold it! You can go home, kid. Get him out of here. You'd better quit while you're ahead, now get him out of here. Leo, have you lost your mind? You can forget about this. And what, do I got to remind you about evidence obtained under duress? It's inadmissible, Leo! Right. The way the law protects those maggots out there, you'd think they were an endangered species. Come on, will you give me a break? Let's not get into that. The facts are, we got no evidence, and we can't hold this kid. He's got an ironclad alibi. = you believe it? Everything he says checks out. The theater and the market. We questioned him about the partridge girl. It's says in the police report that... Yeah, at the time of the murder, he was in a downtown hotel, in bed with a whore. Do you believe that? Leo, every case is a poker hand. A good hand you stay, a bad hand you fold. You're telling me you're gonna fold? Well, I'm gonna stay. He's our man, captain, I'm gonna get him. Hello? I'd like to see lieutenant Kessler, please. I'm his daughter. You say he's your father? Yeah. He's my father, I'm his daughter. I've got something for him. Well, how come I've never heard him mention a daughter? Well, that's because it seldom crosses his mind that he has one. I almost had him the other day. Blew it. Bring him in. I'd like to have another whack at him. Aw, come on, clem, bring him in. Bring him in for what? Any knifing, rape. Any obscene crime at all. Just haul him in. Give me another chance at him. Malone. Leo, your daughter's out here. Ask her if she can wait. = tell her to wait. What do you say? = t don't know. Mcann, what do you say? I'm not sure if I'm qualified, sir. Then I'm not sure you belong here. What do you say? It wouldn't take very long, I'm afraid, for Warren Stacy to hire an attorney, charge us with harassment and get an injunction. Malone. She can't wait, Leo. I'll go see what she wants. How about it? You know as well as I do that from a legal standpoint we can't lay a finger on this guy. I remember when legal meant lawful. Now it means some kind of a loophole. Oh hi, miss Kessler. Your father's busy right now. Is there something I can do for you? Yeah, I guess so. There was this guy at the funeral. I couldn't remember where I'd seen him before, until I found this. It's from Betty Johnson's office picnic. That's me, there's Karen, that's Betty. That's Dale Anders, her boyfriend, the one that was killed. And that's the guy from the funeral. Do you know who he is? What about him? Well, Betty was scared of him. Do you know who he is? Is this the only time you ever saw him? Yes, now will you quit trying to act like a cop? Miss Kessler, I may not look like a cop to you, but I am a cop, that's my job. Now, will you please answer the question? Why was she afraid of him? Well, he was always talking about people who put him down, and how he was going to get even with them. May I keep this? = sure. Is there anything else? Yeah, tell my dad if he's too busy to see me, he might try calling me sometime. Oh, and... I don't think he'll have any trouble getting through. At the hospital, they know I have a father. Miss Kessler, thanks for the help. = sure. All right, all right, I'll get it! When I go out, I want to borrow that sweater of yours. Was it in here? Would you shut up, please? Who? Oh. Laurie? Hello? Hi, baby. How's it going? How are you? Well I'm fine, who's this? You don't khow me, but I know you. You're beautiful. I love you. Well, what good does it do to love me if I don't know who you are? What does that mean? It means I want to eat your pussy. You give blowjob, I give it to you in the ass. How about it, baby? = you have reached a disconnected number. This is a recording. Who was that? Just some creep. Thanks for bringing in the photograph. Did it mean anything? Possibly. Well, we're always looking for new information. Dad, is there something else you want to know? Just came by to see how you were doing. = I'm fine. Working you hard, are they? = like slaves. Well, at least you get to wear a nice uniform. Why else would I want to be a nurse? Listen, if you hit a shag or anything, let me know. I can pull a few strings. I know the superintendent. Dad, you didn't come all the way down here to tell me that. Now, what's on your mind? Can't I be interested in how you're doing? = sure. Just don't pull any strings, ok? = ok is that all you're going to eat? Yeah, well, that's all I have time for. I only have a few minutes. I'm paying for both. Uh, paying for three. That's some lunch, dad. Coleslaw and quiche? I hate quiche. Then why did you take it? I thought it was pie. Coleslaw makes me sick. Let's get organized about the party tonight, okay? Listen, I can swing some grain alcohol. You're kidding. Oh, that'd be terrific. Doreen, bunny, ola, this is detective mcann. Hi. How do you do? = you don't look like a detective. Ah, well so I've been told. Excuse me. Are you and Laurie's dad partners? Actually, right now I'm more or less trying to measure up to his standards. - It was nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you. See you later, Laurie. Bye. His standards of what? Now, what the hell kind of remark is that? Your father's a man who's been out there on the firing line for over 20 years. Oh, god. Do you have any idea how many commendations he's received? He's an outstanding public servant. Nobody says he isn't. But when my mom needed him, or I wanted him, where was he? Out on the firing line, earning commendations. What is your problem? Your father's a cop, you've got to make allowances for that. What the hell do you think I've been doing for 20 years? This place is an ulcer factory. What's wrong here? Detective mcann was just telling me how much he admires you. You might call this a testimonial lunch. Laurie, wait a minute. Dad, I've gotta go to the lab. I'd like to do better. Let's have dinner sometime, ok? = sure. Why not? I gotta go. Oh, it was a pleasure to see you again, miss Kessler. I am good company, aren't I? You want to go to a party tonight? I beg your pardon? Well, we're having a party, do you want to come? And you're inviting me? Dad, is he always this slow? Yes or no? I'm late. Well, thank you very much, but... Well, I'm busy. Ok, bye. Busy doing what? Well, quite frankly, I don't think we'd get along. Oh dad, I forgot. I got an obscene phone call last night from some creep. What'd he say? I don't know, the usual garbage. This one had a Spanish accent. Um... Well, about that party tonight, miss Kessler. Yeah? Well, I've changed my mind. What time shall I pick you up? Now, first of all, attach the microphone to the receiver, and to record, press these two buttons simultaneously. Now, I want you to keep him talking. Just get him to say as much as possible. Do you really think it's the slasher? Well, it's better safe than sorry. Oh, and I brought this police radio. I'm gonna leave it with you. Now, nobody outside the department's supposed to have this, so, just use it in case of emergencies only, ok? You're not trying to worry us? No, actually, I'm trying to scare the pants off you. That's a new approach, most fellows do it manually. Oh, and another thing, I don't want you going anywhere alone, especially at night. Was all this your idea? No, actually, most of it was your father's. For reasons I don't quite comprehend, he seems to be fond of you. No accounting for taste. = it's hot in here! - What? - I said, "it's hot in here!" Take your jacket off. - What? - Take your jacket off! I can't, I have a gun! Why do you have a gun? Oh, he's an officer of the peace. If you disturb the peace, he'll fire a warning shot, and then he'll kill you. Better hide your cocaine, and no shooting up in the toilet! You've just ruined my whole evening. Having a good time? Oh, wonderful time. And to think I almost turned you down. You know, when I was in college, I really used to love this sort of thing. I must be getting old. You know, you could be. You have any dizziness, shortness of breath? Maybe we should check your prostate. Oh, you've got to stop being so shy. Are you... Married? Don't you think you might have asked me that before you invited me here? Well, your moral standards are so high, I'm sure you would've told me if you were. Besides, I think the only reason you came here was 'cause you thought I needed protection from Mr. obscene. That is not entirely true. Don't move. Wait, don't shoot! We weren't doing anything! It's all right, don't be alarmed. Just carry on. As you were. It's ok. Is that what you call keeping the peace? Where are we going? Anywhere but here. Well, thanks for dinner. It was terrific. Well, thanks for inviting me to the party. I actually had a nice time. Yeah, well I actually had a date with an intern. But he had to cancel. It was ok, I thought he was a pain. You know, I thought you were, too. That's all right. I thought you were fairly obnoxious yourself. Yeah, have you changed your mind? I'm thinking about it. Well, don't strain your brain. The last thing I want to do is get involved with a cop. Well, I don't blame you. Uh... Good night, miss Kessler. What're you doing Saturday? Saturday's my day off. Um... The phone. Hello? Hi, baby. What's doing? How you been? Oh, uh, it's you again. How about we get together, huh? What you say? Well, I don't usually go out with strangers, uh... What'd you say your name was? = call me Pedro. That means Peter. I got the biggest one you ever see. Well, that's nice to know. What'd you have in mind, Pedro? I take you to a motel. We do it every way there is. How you like it? Up, down, front, back? Whatever suits you, amigo, uh... Where, where should I meet you? What you say? Well tell me, tell me what hotel, and I'll meet you there. Like hell you will. Don't fool with me, bitch. But, I thought you loved me. Kiss my ass, cunt! I love to stick it to you, that's what I love. Your father's a pig, your mother's a whore. Who told you, that's supposed to be a secret. I wouldn't piss on the best part of you, if you was on your knees begging for it. Don't fool with me, bitch. But I thought you loved me. Kiss my ass, cunt! I love to stick it to you, that's what I love. Your father's a pig, your mother's a whore. Laurie must be really scared. Yeah, it shook her up pretty badly. I gave her my police radio and showed her how to use it. You didn't tell her this is the guy we're after, did you? Why have her thinking 24 hours a day she's in mortal danger? She is, you know. Yeah, I know. We've got to do something, we can't just sit around. I know, I know. I'm gonna have to think about this. You know, in case no one ever told you, your daughter is something very special. Yeah, I know. Well, good night. See you in the morning. Smells like pretty good stuff. Confiscated material? You testing to make sure it's the real thing? I didn't expect anybody this late. Yeah, I guess not. Listen... I have a tape here I want you to give to millikan. Have him make a voice print and then compare it with the one we have on Warren Stacy. Where do you keep that tape? = in the file. Well, maybe you better check, make sure it's still there. = I will. You will, when? You want it now? No big rush, just as long as you do it within the next five minutes. Was there anything else? No, just see that millikan gets right on it, ok? Yes, sir. Um... I hope you don't feel you have to say anything about... Illegal possession of marijuana? Yes. I don't see any evidence. I can't bring any charges against you. Much obliged, sir. Yeah, me too. I was 12 years old. Stupid thing to do, but I was angry. I'd been punished. Yeah, yeah, for hurting the neighbor's daughter. Cutting her with a knife. It was an accident! You like hurting girls? I won't answer that! Call me Pedro. That means Peter. I got the biggest one you ever see. I take you to a motel. We do it every way there is. Same voice print. The same man, no doubt about it. And you want me to take him to court on this? It's a lousy misdemeanor. I mean, you're going to get 30 days, at most. Now, what's that going to accomplish? It gives us 30 days to find something to hold him permanently. What do you think, mcann? Well, sir, I think that whatever lieutenant Kessler asks for is what he should get. Well then, get a warrant and pick him up. Uh, what's all that? You told me to take his clothes to the lab. Just the clothes he was wearing on the night of the 7th, red jacket, striped shirt, bluejeans. What about the suit, the blue one he wore to the funeral? Ok, that too. Perfect match. Blood type, ab negative. Also evidence of hepatitis, now dormant. = then that's it. How do you figure a guy like this? Sets up a perfect alibi, and then blows it with a thing like that. Why didn't he have them cleaned or burned them? Well, I think that might look fairly suspicious, don't you? Well, suspicion leaves a reasonable doubt. This leaves no doubt at all, which makes him look awfully dumb. Well, he doesn't strike me as particularly dumb. Everybody makes mistakes. I made one myself, last night. I forgot to have Kessler sign for the tape he picked up. Last night? No, I was with Kessler last night, till almost 1:00 in the morning, at his house. Well, it was about 2:00. Anyway, have him come in and sign. Sign here. Standard bail bond agreement, what it'll cost you. = all it want is out. = that's what we're here for. They put you in, I get you out, Mr. Dante keeps you out. What's he looking at, Dave? Did they read you your right to remain silent? Did you? = of course. Good boy. We plead not guilty, and demand a jury trial. With their backlog, nobody's going to pay any attention to a sexy phone call. I can practically guarantee you a suspended sentence. Excuse me. I'm talking to my client, do you mind? Well, I have something more for you to talk about. We found some blood on your client's clothing. We're going to rebook him, murder one. - What? - See you at the arraignment you dirty shit! He's lying, there was no blood on my clothes, and he knows it! You dirty shit! He's lying, he's lying, he's lying! Nol nol they're coming out now! Ask the da. Ok, hold it, hold it! The defendant has been charged with first-degree homicide and held without bail. Now, evidence will be presented at the pretrial hearing. No further comment. Well, you did it. Now, tell me how you did it. Hell, luck? You're terrific. How does it look to you, Mr. Dante? I welcome the opportunity to prove that all the evidence against my client is not only flimsy, it's fabricated. What do you mean, fabricated? You got a dictionary, look it up. How well did you know her, Warren? Did you love her, Warren? Did you do it? How well did you know her, Warren? Did you love her, Warren? Dante says the evidence against his client is fabricated. Care to comment? = no. What evidence? Ask him. He wouldn't say. = makes it unanimous. What was he talking about, why would he say fabricated? Oh, they always say that. Daddy, I gotta go, I've already missed two classes. Ok. I'm real proud of my old man. Hey, and you, too. First time I saw you I said, "that's a good detective.” Well, I don't remember that. I said it to myself. I think I'll go down with her. Well, wait a minute, you never answered me. Why fabricated, what's he up to? Forget it. Mcann, can I have a minute of your time? I'm in a hurry. Tomorrow, at the preliminary hearing, I'm gonna call you as a witness. I'm going to ask you about the evidence against Stacy. What about it? You know as well as I do that there were no bloodstains till someone planted them. Well, who says that, Warren Stacy? Look mcann, you can deny it now, but if you lie on the witness stand, that's perjury, and perjury's a serious offense. Well, threatening a witness is fairly serious too, Mr. Dante. Who's threatening? All I'm asking for is the truth. "You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free." But if you don't know the truth, you better find out. See you. Hello, mcann? This is Kessler. Oh, I'm not interrupting anything, am I? I mean, if you have a girl there, I'll hang up. There's no girl, just me. I haven't seen much of you lately. I thought maybe you might've died of old age. I've been meaning to call you, Laurie. I know it sounds like a lame excuse, but I've been very busy. I've got a new partner, a new assignment. Well, I've got your radio here. And I was kind of expecting you to come by and pick it up. Maybe say hello, if you felt like it. Yeah. Sure, I'll do that. Is this Paul mcann, the detective? I mean, I feel like I'm talking to a stranger. I'm sorry, I've just had a lot on my mind lately. Look, I've got another call. I really have been thinking about you, and I would like to see you. I gotta go, I'll call you, ok? Yeah, sure. Hello? Just wanted to remind you, in case you forgot. When you testify at the preliminary hearing tomorrow, remember, you're sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you god. See you in court, mcann. When Kessler came to get the tape and the voice print, did you discuss anything else with him? Oh, shit. He told you, huh? All right, let's hear it. Well, the boys grabbed a load of, you know, stuff. They burned most of it, but this was such high quality... Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What are you talking about? When Kessler came here, you were with him the entire time, correct? Sure, except when I went to get the tape. But when you came back, he was still here? Where else? No, I mean here. Right here in this room. No, he was in there. What's kept in that refrigerator? Blood samples. Nice, very nice, just right. All right, let's hear it again. Guilty or not quilty? Not guilty. Good boy. We can always plead insanity later. = I'm not insane. I know that, but in case we have to go that route, I just want you to know that we're in pretty good shape. No matter what you've done, the worse it is, the more the jury's going to think that no normal person could have done it, you follow me? So we work out a routine. Say you're two people. One good, one bad, you start hearing voices. The bad boy telling the good boy what to do. He doesn't want to do it, but he can't help himself. You see? You're saying I'm a schizo? No, Warren. I'm saying that you'll walk out of a crazy house alive. They'll carry you out of a gas chamber dead. What? Stacy's lawyer's putting me on the witness stand. He says Stacy was framed. Oh, that Dave Dante's not a lawyer, he's a shyster. He's contending that the evidence was planted. Do you know that, to him, this is one big game? If he gets Stacy off, he's won the super bowl. And to all the scum out there, he's a hero. I went back to the lab and I talked to the technician. And I asked him if you... What the hell did you do that for? Because! Why didn't you ask me? Because I was afraid you might tell me you planted those bloodstains. Yeah, well, t did. Jesus, Leo. Why? What the hell's the matter with you? What kind of a question is that, you know why. We could've nailed him, sooner or later. After counting how many more dead? He had to be stopped. And the only way to do that is to put him away. You understand what I'm saying? Yes, I understand what you're saying. You want me to go into a court of law and to commit perjury. What the hell do you think he's gonna do? He's gonna perjure himself. He'll lie about everything he's done. Stacy's not a cop, he didn't take an oath. An oath, for Jesus Christ. Would you take an oath that he's not guilty? You go in that courtroom, and forget what's legal and do what's right. If I thought it was right, I'd swear to anything you say. And we will then present evidence that the crime was premeditated. And then we will call witnesses to testify that the defendant harbored malice towards the victim. Testimony confirmed by the victim's own diary. And then we will produce evidence that there were bloodstains on the defendant's clothing. Clothing that he acknowledges wearing on the night of the murder. Expert witnesses from the police forensic laboratory testifying that the blood type... Excuse me, your honor. Your honor, may we please approach the bench? You may. Your honor, I must ask for a dismissal of charges against the defendant, based on... Is that true, lieutenant? You planted the evidence? Yes, sir. Can you give us a statement? What have you got to say, Warren? How does it feel to be a free man? How do you feel about what lieutenant Kessler did? He's the one who belongs in jail. He not only violated due process, he thumbed his nose at the bill of rights. He's a disgrace to our system of law enforcement. Excuse me, lieutenant. Warren Stacy says you should be in jail. Can we have a comment? Why don't you go yourself? Turn that damned thing off. What we need is another drink. Come on Laurie, I think you've had too many drinks already. = no. We're celebrating. First time I ever got drunk with my father. Here. You know, dad, you ought to fire your housekeeper. Yeah, well, I've been fired once today already. That's enough. = son of a bitch. I hope he gets what's coming to him. I hope it's sooner than later. You know, they'll probably give him a medal. I'm talking about Stacy. I'm talking about mcann. Oh, well. You know, I broke the law. He wouldn't buy it. 20 years ago, I would have felt the same way. = t don't care. T still hate him. Laurie, you had enough. Dad, you don't understand. Alcohol is the most effective tranquilizer I know. You've still had enough. Yeah, but when you get up in the morning... Oh my god, the morning, I've got a test, I'll call a cab. No you won't, I'll take you home. No no, I'll call a cab. I'll take you home, I'm your father, you don't argue with your father. I'm not arguing, dad. You wanna take me home? Ok. Listen Laurie, if Stacy calls again, you call me. And if you can't reach me by the phone, use the police radio. Ok. And tell your friends up there to keep the doors locked. They shouldn't open up to anybody that they don't know. You know, dad, I bet when you had your daughter, you didn't expect she'd be so much trouble. Well, I don't mind, if you don't. All right, now you stay in touch, ok? Yeah, hello? Hello? How you doing, Mr. Kessler? Tam. I told you what a dirty shit you are. Now the whole world knows. Right? What's the matter, cat got your tongue? To forgive is divine, they say. But I don't aspire to being an angel, know what I mean? You tried to kill me, I owe you for that. And I always try and pay what I owe. Be seeing you, Mr. Kessler. Likewise, Mr. Stacy. I used to like this job, now I hate coming to work. I'm thinking about putting in for a transfer. Why can't they get rid of him? I can't sleep nights. Me, neither. What's wrong, Mrs. byrd? What are these doing here? Answer me! I didn't put them there. No? Well, who did? Not me, why would I? Take them down, get rid of them this minute! Will you listen to me, I'm telling you... I'm going straight to personnel. I don't want you in this office. Jeez. You trying to commit suicide? That's funny, I was going to ask you the same thing. You're making life very unpleasant for Warren Stacy. Who told you that? Oh, we in the police department have our sources. Ah. You keep it up, he's going to come after you. = you think so? Leo, if you wake up one day with your throat cut... I'll thank you for warning me. Say hello to Laurie? Sure, I'll do that. Tell her I drive by the dormitory several times a night. Me, too. I'm obliged. Are you enjoying yourself, Mr. Stacy? Come on, get in. First things first, hon. 50 one way, round the world 75. Ok, come on. What can I do for you? The girl that was standing with you here a while ago. Where does she usually take her tricks? Who wants to know? Usually the Regis, sometimes the drexel or golden state. All right, thanks. Want drinks, just call the bar. I got my own. Give me a wake-up call in three hours. Wowee. Looks like you got your work cut out for you. Hey, that's too much. My union don't approve of me drinking on the job. It'll loosen you up. I'm already a loose woman. Bottoms up. That's the story of my life. - I'm going to take a shower. - What for? Because I like to be clean. Buddy? A guy about this tall, young, came in with a hooker. Which room? Oh, brother, it ain't our policy to... Aw, come on, which room? Here. - 224. Give me the key. Don't I know you? Haven't we met before? Will you get that, bun? What, looking like this, you get it. I can't, my toast'il burn. Well, take it out, dummy. Come on buddy, give me a line! Somebody get the phone? Bunny? Ok, ok. Who is it? Hello? Flowers for miss Kessler. Oh, I'll take 'em. She has to sign for them. Laurie, somebody bought you some flowers. Who're they from? Who else could they be from? Your good-looking cop. Don't open the door. What? Oh, my god. Don't open that door! No, no, oh my god, no no! Leave me alone! Where is she?! Where is she?! = she's not here! Laurie Kessler! - Ti don't know! Where is she? Laurie Kessler, where is she?! =I don't know! - Laurie's at the hospital. - You're lying, you're lying! - No I'm not! - You're lying! - I swear she's not here! - Where is she? Hello, mcann? Come in, mcann. Kessler, this is mcann. County hospital, dormitory 3, over. 10-4, we're on our way. County hospital, hit it. T swear! Tell me, tell me where she is. - She's at the hospital. - You're lying! No no, really, she's at the hospital. That's where she is. I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you, I won't hurt you. She's at the hospital, I swear, I swear. She's on duty at the hospital. That's where she is, she's working. No! No! No! Why didn't you tell me? Why did you make me think she was in there? No, no, no! My father's gonna kill you! Oh no he's not, I know where he's at. That was him on the phone just now. He'll be here any second. Oh, yeah? Then I guess I better hurry up. = that's him! He's here! = you can count on this. I'll be back. = Laurie?! Mcann! Don't shoot, get back, get away! I tried to keep you from running loose. Now there are three more dead girls. = you drove me to it! That blood on my clothes! Those pictures on the wall where everybody could see them! Digging into my personal life, that's my life! Those phone calls on me every minute! All those girls. You sick son of a bitch. = t am sick. T am sick. I didn't know what I was doing. It's like something was happening and I couldn't control myself. Why else would I kill girls I don't even know? It's like I'm two different people. I hear voices telling me what to do. Once it begins, I can't stop. Go ahead, arrest me, take me in. You can't punish me, I'm sick. You can't punish me for being sick. All you can do is lock me up. But not forever. One day, I'll get out. That's the law! That's the law, that's the law! And I'll be back! I'll be back! You'll hear from me! You and the whole fucking world! no we won't.
