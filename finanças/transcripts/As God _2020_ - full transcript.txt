[English subtitles are available.] [Li Shuwen] Hey. Must be my lucky day today. Sheltering from the rain brought me business. Boss. Don't move. What do you have here? You seem pretty suspicious. Please go. He's asking us to leave. [As God] [In early Republic of China, ] [cults and unorthodox sects were rife.] [The Four Dharma Kings of the Liver and Gallbladder Sect] [were known for their impregnable bodies, immune to all poisons.] [They were specimens of heterodox schools.] [The Sect of All Things proclaimed that NÃ¼wa is alive and among us.] [But it was all illusions and tricks of the eye.] [And amidst all the deception, ] [the fight to overturn these fake gods] [by the wise continues.] Don't kneel! Do not believe in such lies. [Wu Zhongfeng, Sun Tong, Sun Jin] Gods and spirits do not exist in this world. The one who can save us is ourselves! Get up! Why don't you save yourself first? What else do you have? Show me what you've got. The real god is here! [Infinite Ancestor] All fake gods, disperse! Let's go. Hurry. Here comes another joker. We are the Liujia Holy Sect. This is our leader, the Infinite Ancestor. The Ancestor has the ability to control the weather, pluck stars from the sky and cover the moon. Come, bow and pay your respect before him. You shall be blessed with peace. Words of deceit! There's another one of him! And another one! Witchcraft. Evil! Apparitions. - This guy is really good. - Yes. You're fake. It's just an illusion. You're an illusion. - I am dignified and of good virtue. - Master Wu! I won't fuss over this. You may go. Now, pray to the real god! The Infinite Ancestor is great and indomitable! Master Wu, are you okay? Careful. [Melon Town is going to suffer.] [They will all be taught a lesson when Liejun returns.] - Mister. - Yes? These are all the latest rouge. You've picked out so many. Which one are you going with? - Let me think about it. - Okay. Sir. Your holy plaque is here. I welcome the holiness. Apologies for not being prepared. Please wait. What are you looking at? Let's go. Wait! My stuff. Give it back. [Yang Liejun] What stuff? This. I took it. Couldn't help it. The money was in our hands so it belongs to us. Give it to me. Oh, is that so? Since you're in my hands, you must belong to me. Sir. This is to pay for the rouge. This... Sorry for the mess. I am willing! - I'll do it! - Let me do it! - Let me do it! - Let me! - I'm willing! - Let me! - You, get inside. - Me! - Me first! - I'll do it. I'm willing. - Me! - Let me do it! I'm here! Have you all lost your mind? Wake up! This cult is only trying to insult you. Why are you even knocking on its door? - None of your business! - Stop trying to act all noble. You're not any better. The reality is, either you get insulted, or you insult others. You have a good father. We are nobodies. We have nothing to lose. That's right. Please believe me! They're bad people. - They're lying to you! - What's your problem? So what if you're rich? - Miss Sun. - Mind your own business. Long time no see. Chen Sihai, what are you doing? I know you're a jerk, but I didn't think you'd associate with the cult! Let me go this instance! - Or else, I'll... - You'll what? Why don't you get your little crush, Yang Liejun, to teach me a lesson. Listen. I'm not scared of him. Because by the time he shows up, the two of us would already be one. Wait! What? Tying me up like this is just going to ruin the moment. Why don't you untie me? They're all your men anyway. I won't run away, okay? Okay. My goodness. You missed! Liejun. What? Who are you? What do you think you're doing? Liejun. Venerable, please help me look after her. Okay. Hey, be careful of the Buddha. We have to jump from here. The stairs are blocked. It's so high up. There's no time. Hurry! Protect us, Buddha! Thank you, Buddha. Shuwen? We have to go. This way. Quick! Where are they? This way! Shuwen, when did you get back? Why didn't you pay us a visit? Are you still going to leave? Why is your face so hot? Do you have a fever? It doesn't seem like it. Master. Shuwen. When did you come back? Master. I went to school, but the main door was shut. This is a trying time. Nobody has the means to learn martial arts. It has been some time since I moved here. Jin'er has been the one taking care of me. Shuwen. You've been working as a runner in the West. There was no news about you. Have you been well? [Virtuous] I've been a bad student. - Actually... - I know. I know everything. Nowadays, the foreigners' ships and cars have come to our shores. Many couriers have closed. I'm sure it affected you too. Shuwen. As martial arts practitioners, we do not only train our bodies, but more importantly, our minds. "Train our mind." [Heart Sutra] Shuwen. Come to my room later. Okay. Is it pretty? Beautiful. Don't worry. Master Wu has told us about your predicament. I don't think it's all bad for you. Besides, your senior would appreciate your help, right? Actually, - the reason I came back... - Shuwen. How tall are you? What? Looks good. What do you think? You and Liejun are of similar builds. I was worried it wouldn't fit him. But it looks like I was worried for nothing. - I should take it... - No, don't. Wait a minute. Look over there. What's that? Shuwen! Xiaowen. Liejun. Liejun! Goodness. Why are you sneaking about? I wanted to surprise you. For you. I like this color. Xiaowen. Those were some pretty good moves. What about another go? It's Liejun. Master! Jiu, go and prepare some food. Liejun honed his skills on the battlefield. Naturally, it's more lethal. Shuwen, as a runner, cares about relationships. His moves are more calculated. To tolerate and be humane are signs of a hero too. I'm proud of you both. I've learned about Liujia Sect from the letters that Jin'er sent. I decided to come back. I spent the whole day today doing some sleuthing. I found it is indeed a criminal cult. They've been more active these days. They recently put on a show where their god supposedly manifested. All the town's residents fell for it. Manifestation of god? - You saw it too? - Of course. But this is not scientific. Sooner or later, I'm going to oust their trickery. Hey, Liejun. I think it's better to beat them to the punch. Lead your men and reclaim Melon Town. Fists don't do the talking. Now, the government has the authority. But the Braid Army is planning for a revival. Every party and sect is holding their breath. We're trying to figure out Zhao Guangxiao and what he's really up to. If he's interested in joining us, it wouldn't hurt to have him on our side. After all the commotion that Liujia Sect has created, as the official, he hasn't spoken up. - I'm afraid... - Master. You don't have to worry about that. Save your energy. Let me handle it. No matter how dark it gets, dawn is always around the corner. All right. It has been too long since we've gathered. Come. Let's enjoy ourselves. - Xiaowen. - Cheers. Cheers. Why are you here? It's time our relationship proceeds to the next step. Liejun. Have you forgotten our promise? Of course not. We will marry only when the revolution succeeds. We're already in the Republic of China. Doesn't that mean the revolution had succeeded? Our goal is to create a world that is fair and free for all. But the country is still being controlled by the greedy and powerful. So no, it hasn't succeeded. But that concerns the nation. This is about us. Some people have limited capabilities. This is as far as they can go. But you're different, Liejun. You're going to become a great hero. I'll wait for you. But I can't wait. First comes suffering. Then comes joy. Isn't that our ideal? All right. Good night. Jin'er. If one day, I do become a hero, you get half of the credit. - Liejun. - Yes? Have you noticed that Xiaowen has been... I know what you're trying to say. After traveling to so many places, I'm sure he has seen a lot. You're his senior. You should help him more. I will. As for Liujia Sect, what do you plan to do next? I want to pay a visit to the government office and see if I can dig up anything on Zhao Guangxiao and the cult. Take me along. - Take him to be paid. - Yes, sir. -Come with me. [-A few days ago, ] [I delivered a parcel to the office.] [But someone was lying in wait that night] [wanting to kill me.] [Thinking about it now, ] [the office] [must be hiding something.] [Government Office] What are you two doing? Patrolling. Come on. Stop right there. Bring the tea to the commander. Let's go. Zhao Guangxiao and I used to be in the same company. - He'd recognize me. - Okay. Yes. You're right, sir. Hey. Pour it. How are we supposed to drink? Okay. Are you dumb or what? Pay attention. Mr. Chen. Our plan turned out pretty good. It's all thanks to you, sir. Now, what should our next step be? Sir. I'm waiting for your order. You need not worry about that. As a... Who's there? Are you blind? I'm sorry, sir. Get lost! - Check who's out there. - Yes, sir. So Liujia Sect really is connected to Zhao Guangxiao. - Liejun. - Yes? Liejun. These past years, something has been on my mind that I didn't know who to talk to. What's wrong, Xiaowen? Since we're young, we haven't kept any secrets from each other. Every time you got into trouble, I was there to bail you out. Come, tell me what's bothering you. I'm not the master. When we were previously sparring, you should've felt it. - Our school's kung fu... - That's not important. I've been handling guns all day long that I've forgotten my kung fu. But it's different for me. [One time, ] [I strayed into a wolf's den.] [I spent a year] [living with the wolves.] [Since then, ] [every time I was in danger, ] [I felt like I couldn't control myself.] During my last errand, I found myself in trouble again. [I had thought I was the problem.] But after pondering over it, I believe it is related to the parcel I was delivering. So, I must find out Liujia Sect's secret. We'll figure it out. Okay? Liejun. If there really comes a day when I turn into a beast, I'd wish to die by your hands. Don't think too much. It's not that hard to explain when Liujia Sect is concerned. It's probably due to tricks creating illusions. Illusions? Sometimes, what you see is not necessarily the truth. Liejun. I have an idea. What do you think he's doing? That's the smell. Do you smell it? Master Wu, hold it like this and then press. Holy children of Liujia, manifest! - Goodness! - What's happening? Xiaowen? Liejun, there's something wrong with the smoke. Humans can lose their senses. But machines do not lie. Liejun. Good job. - Master. - What should we do next? I checked. The Infinite Ancestor is full of mystery. Unless we find his shelter, it'd be hard to figure out his tricks. Chen Sihai. This is it, Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen. Ms. Sun is inside. She's drunk. What? Do I look like someone who takes advantage of others? - Do I? - Yes. - What? - No! We're going to take her home. Back to my home. I'm coming, my baby! Nice. Come on, my princess. My goodness. My princess is quite heavy. What the hell? One sound and you're dead. I didn't say anything. Tell me all you know about Liujia Sect. I don't know anything. My goodness. Mr. Chen is really having a good time tonight. What do you want me to say? Looks like it's going to take all night. We should just go. - Okay. - Let's go. Halt. Here. Go. Who dares break into the Liujia Palace? Come on. You're digging your own grave. Run, why don't you? Shuwen! Shuwen, it's me! Shuwen. What's the matter? The Infinite Ancestor destroyed the Liujia Palace. The evidence is gone. Zhao Guangxiao can't run. Let's oust him. No. We can't be hasty. After all, he is a respected official. If he goes down, the town will be in disarray. Then bring your troop to take over the town. Take over? We are not bandits. My master is a man of honor. - Liujia Sect was just revived... - Enough. Shuwen. Calm down. Stay calm, I'm here. Master. Liejun told me everything. It's fine. - Okay? - Master. I'm sorry. I have disappointed you. Don't be silly. Do you know why I was so strict with you? It's to make sure I live an honest life. I had allowed you to go and see the world and left this medallion with you because I didn't want you to be affected by the darkness. I hoped you'd always have a kind heart. The fact that you're anxious reassures me. Deep down, you are a good person. Follow your heart. That's the right way. I trust you. Okay. [Virtuous] [The central government ordered you to provide backup] [but you haven't made any moves.] [What exactly are you planning?] [I've only got a few sorry guns.] [They're wolves.] [And I'm just a pug.] Damn you! I'll take care of you right here and now then. Sir, I beg you to spare me! Idiot Pang. I gave you a choice. Did you think I was scared of you? This Tianmang drug is indeed magical. Liejun. Liejun? Where is he? Do you think he has gone to challenge Zhao Guangxiao on his own? I'll help him then. Go back to Liujia Palace. Find proof that Zhao Guangxiao is colluding with Liujia Palace. Even if Liejun did do something to Zhao Guangxiao, we would have a backup. Okay. You guys were pretty useful, weren't you? I trusted you for nothing! Looks like Liujia Sect has to be cut off. You can't do that, Mr. Zhao. Don't shut it down, right? Right. The money I invested hasn't seen its return yet. Liejun. He's the one who burned Liujia Palace. Why such a late visit? Guangxiao. We agreed to work together in the letters that we exchanged. You provide the drugs and I provide the troops. Isn't that right? Well... Let me explain. Is that right? Or not? Yes. Then why did you have to horse around with the Liujia Sect? They're either thieves or bandits. They're incapable of great things. I was only trying to recover the cost a little. Then you should've used your brain a little. [Do you know how much they kept for themselves?] Damn you. You tricked me? What are you looking at? Run! Guards, go after them! Forget it. Liejun. Don't fret. Look. This is the latest product that was just delivered. It's 100 times more potent than the old drug. Traitor! Master! Yang Liejun, you wicked bastard! Master. - What are you doing here? - You traitor! - Master! - Do not call me "master"! I don't have a pupil like you. Master. My men are on the brink of despair and danger. The world out there is crueler than you ever imagined. Whereas I am the one who needs to bear everything. Very soon, my enemies will come for my head. This is the only thing that can make my troops run over the opponents. This is the power of science! Science does not bewitch. It doesn't cloud your judgment. Become the king, defeat the enemies. That's the only way! Those good-for-nothing and outdated practices need to go. That's how you become the true king! I'm the one. It's people like me who are fighting through blood, sweat, and tears in order to control my own fate! While you people only care about trivial matters. You didn't have to know all this. I only have a word of advice. You better not try and stop me. Because I... cannot be stopped. Yang Liejun. You should take a good look at yourself right now. Master. You should be proud of me. Liujia Sect is a cult. It has been destroyed. You guys should go home. They're all orphans. They have no home. What about you? I am the Infinite Ancestor's disciple. I had been following him all across Tianlu Mountain. The Infinite Ancestor ran away. He can't help you. I know where he is. [Mr. Zhao has given the order.] Liujia Sect is a cult that deceived the people. The criminal, Wu Zhongfeng was determined as its leader. He was secretly calling the shots and tried to kill government officials. He has now been brought to justice. Anyone who is found connected to Liujia Sect will face severe punishment. Shuwen. It's me. Xiaowen. We lost our master. How did this happen? I tried to kill Zhao Guangxiao last night. Master followed me. But they had set up a trap. Master did everything he could to allow me to escape. Xiaowen! Xiaowen. You must not be hasty. I've already lost my master. I'm not going to lose you too. Don't worry. I'll bring my troops here and avenge his death. Today, the two of us will bid him goodbye. Master. I will avenge you. I'm off. I'll go with you. No. The whole town is looking for me. It's too dangerous if you come with me. Xiaowen. Take care of Jin'er for me. Nice. Very nice. I know you want it. What's happening? Who's disrupting my happy time? Let me see. [Evergreen Tea House] Behold, the reincarnation of the Infinite Ancestor. Devout followers! Come and pray! Hold up your hands, oh followers! Receive the Ancestor's blessing and fortune. Almost there. - A scam. - Liar. - A lair! - What a scam! - What a liar. - You liar! - Liar! - What a scam! Tell me one thing. - What a scam! - Let's go! - We've been scammed. - A liar. Liejun. This is the new drug my men came up with. Not only it increases their power to the maximum, but it also ensures that they obey your orders without fail. With this, you can defeat the troops of the three provinces with ease and take over the whole Zhongnan. Become the ultimate ruler. You shouldn't have come. Was it you? Xiaowen. Don't ask questions. There's no point. I'll forget this ever happened if you leave right now. We will remain as good brothers, okay? Just shoot them. Save your breath and get it over with. You're really annoying. Yang Liejun. You damn bastard. Wuss! Why did you lie to me? Do you really want to know the truth? It's not so bad to be tricked by me. Once I win the war, none of you would know any better. Nothing's going to change. But now, how should I wrap this up? You're shameless! Shoot me. Shoot. Shoot! You don't even know how to shoot. Yet you talk about revolution. A true revolutionist harbors love and respect for mankind. This is not the way. Disregarding human lives. Kill me. I truly love you. It's too bad. You don't get me. Liejun. In the past, you always gave me a handicap of three moves. Today... I'll let you go first. You'll let me? Okay. Today... I'll give you that chance. You had your three moves. I owe you... nothing. You made me realize that humans can be scarier than beasts. I am not a beast, nor a human! I'm a god that determines my own fate. Kill him. I have the godly drug. That makes me a god. [Shuwen.] [Shuwen.] [Remember what I told you.] Follow your heart. Gods don't die. Shuwen? Shuwen. Get up. Shuwen. [Dad.] [I know you're sad to see me go.] [But I wish to follow my heart.] [I want to see the world.] [Miss, Master Li has left.] [He left this for you.] [Dear Sun Jin, ] [I hope you're doing well.] [I left without saying goodbye.] [Please understand.] [It's just that] [I am unable to go with you.] [You often said that the world is asleep] [and needs to be awakened.] [But what is a dream?] [What does being awake mean?] [I don't know the answers.] [And since I don't, ] [I must stay humble.] [But the days are long.] [The world is vast.] [We shall meet again.] [Your little brother, ] [Shuwen.]
