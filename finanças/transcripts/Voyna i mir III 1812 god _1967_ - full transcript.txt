GRANTINSH as Woltzogen D. EISENTALS as Clausewitz P. SAVIN as Timokhin On June 12, the armies of Western Europe crossed the Russian border, and the war began, an event completely opposed to human reason, and human nature. Will you listen to me, Papa and Mama? I have decided. You'll have to let me join the army. You can't stop me! - Don't be silly. You should study! - I’m not being silly, Papa. Fedya Obolensky's even younger than I’m and he's going. And besides, how do you expect me to study when... when... our country's in danger? You keep quiet, will you please? I tell you I’m serious. Nonsense! He's still wet behind the ears and he wants to go to war! Just listen to him! Almighty God! Take Thou the lance and shield, and rise up to aid us. Put to shame and confusion them that have devised evil against us, and let Thy mighty angel confound and destroy their ilk. Smite down our enemies and trample them swiftly underfoot. Our father, the Czar! Hurrah! Which one is the Czar? Which one is the Czar? Kutuzov has done nothing else but cause annoyance to the Czar. How is it possible to appoint as our commander-in-chief a man who can't mount a horse, who goes to sleep at council meetings? His morals are the worst you can conceive. I won't even dwell upon his so- called qualities as a strategist. At a time like this how can anyone call on a man who is so old? Just imagine. A blind general! He can't see anything. He could only play blind man's bluff. Never have our forces fought with such valor. But the fate of the army and of the fatherland are in the hands of a good minister and a bad general. Barclay is delaying action. The whole army is critical of him. The French are at Vitebsk. In four days they may reach Smolensk. Or they may be already there. Prince, what do you think of the situation? l? The field of operations may move so near to us that... I have said and I still say the field of operations is Poland, and that the enemy will never get beyond the Niemen river. When the snow melts, they'll drown in the Polish marshes. But, Prince, the letter says that they're at Vitebsk now. Ah, the letter... He says the French were defeated. Near what river did he say? The Prince never mentioned that. Mikhail Ivanovich, how do you want those plans altered? Go ahead! Take everything! I’ll set the place on fire myself! Those devils won't get it! Nowhere did he seem to be comfortable. But worst of all was his customary place on the couch in the study. This couch had become a dread, because of the oppressive thoughts that kept turning over in his mind when he lay there. No, no, not like that! There's no peace anywhere! Blast it all! Yes, there was something important I was saving to think about in bed. The bolts? No, it was something, something in the drawing-room. Tishka! What did we speak about at dinner? About Prince Mikhail. Will you keep quiet? I know, about Prince Andrei's letter. The French are at Vitebsk. In four days they may reach Smolensk. Perhaps they're there by now. Tishka! No, nothing. I don't need anything. Soul's in pain... The Princess is afraid. The soul's in pain. The soul's in pain. All my thoughts... were about you. I kept calling you all night. If I had only known! I was afraid to come in. - You weren't sleeping? - No, I wasn't sleeping. Why didn't you come, my dear? Thank you for all you've done, my child, my dear... Forgive me, and thank you. Forgive me, and thank you. Will you please call Andriusha? I have a letter from him. Where is he? He's with the army, father. At Smolensk. Yes, Russia has perished. They've murdered Russia! I want to try and sing again. It’s something to do, anyway. An excellent idea. You know, Nikolai's been decorated. Saint George's Cross. I’m so proud for him. I know. I sent him the announcement. Well, I don't want to interrupt you. Don't you think it's wrong for me to sing? Not at all. Why wrong? Quite the contrary. But why do you ask? I don't want to do anything you might disapprove of. I trust you in everything. You mean a lot to me, you've been such a help. The same announcement also said that Bolkonsky's in the army again. Do you think he'll be able to forgive me one day? Or will he always hold it against me? What do you think? I think he has nothing to forgive. In his place, I would... You're different. There's no one who's kinder and more generous than you are. I think if you hadn't been there then to help me, and now too, I don't know what would have become of me. Because... Oh, yes, I had forgotten. I must go home. Why are you going? Because... Simply I have business. No! Why? Tell me... Have you heard the great news? Kutuzov is field marshal! All differences have been settled. I’m so glad, delighted! At last we have a real leader, a man! - I’ve heard he's blind, Prince? - Nonsense. He sees well enough. He's a very shrewd fellow. I’ve known him for years. He's coming! With such fine men, why should we keep retreating? Good morning, Prince. How do you do, my dear boy? Come with me. I’ve sent for you because I would like to keep you with me. I thank Your Highness, but I’m afraid I’m no more good for staff work. I’m used to my regiment. I like my officers and they, I think, like me. I’d be sorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being in attendance to you, believe me... I regret it. You would have been of use to me, but you're right. It’s not here that we want men. The regiments wouldn't be what they are, if all the would-be counselors would serve in them like you. I remember you at Austerlitz. I remember you, I remember you with the flag. Ah, counselors and counselors! There're always a multitude of counselors, but men are scarce. Always in haste, and more haste, worse speed. It’s easy enough to take fortresses, but it's hard to win a campaign. It takes time and patience. At Rustchuk, Kamensky used his soldiers, and l, patience and time. And I took more fortresses than Kamensky. And I made the Turks eat horsemeat. Give me some time, and the French shall, too! Take my word for it, I’ll make them eat horsemeat! We shall have to give battle, though, shan't we? We must, if everyone wants to. What's one to do? Well, goodbye, my boy, go your own way, God bless you! I know your path is the path of honor. Remember, with all my heart, I feel for your sorrow, and that for you, I’m not his highness, nor prince, nor commander, but simply a father to you. As the girls went to the river, As the girls went to the river, Bumblebee, bumblebee, wonder-wonder-wonder me, That was Lusha, my honeybee! Bumblebee, bumblebee, wonder-wonder-wonder me, That was Lusha, my honeybee! They a-stripped of their shirts, They a-stripped of their shirts... Well, fellow countryman, are we to put down here, or taken out to Moscow? It’s not soldiers only, but peasants too, I have seen today! Peasants, too, they're hunting up, they can't pick and choose now. They want to mass all the people together. It’s a matter of Moscow, you see. There's only one thing to do now. Count, Your Excellency, how do you come here? Oh, I wanted to have a look... - There'll be something to look at. - It’s awful... These are from yesterday. The battle went on well into the night at the Shevardino redoubt. A lot of casualties. And we've lost the Shevardino Mound. I would like to join. I want to participate in the battle. One thing I wanted to ask you. Where is the position exactly? That is not in my line. Drive on to Tatarinovo, there's a great deal of digging going there. Come out on a mound, from there you get a view. A view from it? If you would... I would have shown you the way, but... I’m racing to the commander. There's to be a battle tomorrow, and with a hundred thousand troops, we must reckon on 20 thousand wounded at least. And we haven't the stretchers, nor beds, nor doctors for 6,000. There're 10 thousand carts, but we need other things as well. - Look at that get-up! - What's it for? To scare the French away? He looks like a doctor. Pierre's consciousness of the necessity of sacrifice, of suffering at the understanding of the misfortune shared by all, were drawing him inexorably to the site of the imminent fighting. Allow me to ask, what village is that before us? - Burdino, isn't it called? - Borodino. Are these our men there? Yes. And further on are the French. There, you can see them. - Where? -One can see them with the naked eye. - And out there? - Those are our men. Ah, ours! I see. And there? That's him again. Yesterday it was ours, but now it's his. Who are you? A doctor? No, I’m just looking... They're bringing it. They're bringing the Holy Mother, our protectress! - The Holy Mother of Iversky! - The Holy Mother of Smolensk! O Mother of God, save Thy servants. O Mother of God, save Thy servants. Glory be to Father, and to Son, and to Holy Ghost, now and ever and unto ages of ages. O Mother of God, save Thy servants from calamity, for to Thee we all fly as our invincible Bulwark and Protectress, Look with favor, O merciful Mother of God, upon my shameful thought and words and deeds and assuage the pangs of me the sufferer. For we have no other helper, for we have no other hope but only Thee, our protectress. Help us, having compassion on us. In Thee we rest our hopes, and Thee we glorify. For we are Thy servants, and we are not ashamed of Thee. He knew that the morrow's battle would be the most dreadful of all those he had taken part in, and the plain possibility of death presented itself to him vividly, almost like an awesome certainty. The fatherland... The loss of Moscow. And tomorrow I’ll be killed. What is the trial for, since I never will be? I am not! So for whom is it a trial? New conditions of life will arise about which I will know nothing. I’ll no longer exist. I won't exist anymore. I won't exist anymore. Your Highness, the left flank of the second battalion has been brought in closer to the village of Semyonovskaya. Sentries have been posted in each squadron. Who's there? What brings you here? This is really unexpected! I have come, you know... simply... It’s interesting. I wanted to see the battle. What's new in Moscow? My family? Have they finally arrived there? Yes, they have. Julie Drubetskaya told me they had. I went to see them, but I missed them. They've gone to the estate. Today I rode around the disposition of the troops. As a civilian I can't really say I fully understand, but I think I’ve understood the general position. I believe that our position... I think that the left flank is feeble, while the right flank is extended too far. So the whole position of our troops is clear to you? Yes, but how do mean? Victory does not depend, and will never depend on arms, nor even on numbers, and least of all, on strategy. On what does it depend? It all depends on a feeling that's within me, within every soldier. Why were we defeated at Austerlitz? Positions? Absurd. There's no such thing. We just wanted to leave the battlefield quickly. And so tomorrow what will happen? To me, it's simple enough: A hundred thousand Russian and a hundred thousand French troops will meet to fight. The fact is that those 200,000 are going to fight. Those who fight the hardest and spare themselves the least will win. Tomorrow, whatever may happen, we shall win the battle! Your Excellency, that's the plain truth! Who would spare himself now? The soldiers in my battalion wouldn't drink their vodka! "It’s no day for that” is what they said. Carried into a wide extent of country. In that open country I have a father and son and sister at Bald Hills. They've given all Europe up to him, and now they've come to teach us. Fine teachers! So you think the battle tomorrow will be a victory? Yes. There's one thing I would do, if I were in power. I wouldn't take prisoners. The French have destroyed my home and are coming to destroy Moscow. They have outraged and are outraging me every second. They are my enemies. They are all criminals. And so think all the army. They must be put to death. They plunder, they kill my father, and talk of generosity to a foe. No prisoners, but go to give and to meet death! War is not a polite recreation, but the vilest thing in life. And we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept it solemnly as a fearful necessity. Enough lying: if it's war, then it's war and not a game. They meet together to murder one another, as we shall do tomorrow; they slaughter and mutilate tens of thousands of men, and then offer up thanksgiving services for the number of men they have killed, and even add to it in the telling, and glorify the victory, supposing that the more men killed the greater the achievement. One who succeeds in killing most people, gets the greatest rewards. How God can look down from above and hear them? Ah, my dear boy... Life has been a bitter thing for me of late. Well, it's not for long. But you're getting sleepy and it's time I was in bed too. Go. You must be off. Before a battle one needs to get a good sleep. Goodbye, be off. Whether we see each other again or not... I know this is our last meeting. Go, my dear fellow, and Christ be with you. Battalion, forward march! Come on, a cannon ball! Permit me to ask you to move out of the way, sir. Aren't you afraid? You surprise me, sir. - And you? Are you afraid? - Why, to be sure! They can blow your insides right out. You can't help being scared! It’s a soldier's business, but it's surprising to see a gentleman here. Man your guns! Forward march! To attack, forward march! Charge! Fire! Bravo! Ready? Fire! Battalion, in ranks forward march! - What about the Russians? - They stand firm, Sire. They want even more of it. Let them have it then! A hot one! Not this way! Drop on the infantry. What, bowing to a friend? Further right. Again, fire! Guns number four and five, grapeshot fire on the infantry! Look, that one almost blasted our gentleman's hat off. Hey, awkward hussy! Now, you foxes there! Don't you care for our porridge? May I venture to suggest breakfast to Your Majesty? I hope that I can already congratulate Your Majesty on a victory. Gun number ten! Go ahead! With your permission, sir, it's my duty to report that there're but eight rounds left. Must we keep on firing, sir? Grapeshot! Your Highness, we've recaptured the advance posts. Prince Bagration is wounded. Hurry on to Prince Pyotr Ivanovich, and find out exactly what happened. Your Highness... Prince Andrei's regiment was being held in reserve. Without moving from the spot and without firing a single shot, the regiment had already lost a third of its men. - Tell the men they may sit down. - Yes, sir. First battalion, rest! Second battalion, rest! Left, left, left... There's no more ammunition, sir. Run to the reserves, bring the ammunition boxes! I’ll go. M. I’aide-de-camp, tell the men not to crowd together. Look out! Colonel! Lie down! Can this be death? I can't die, I don't want to die. I love life! I love this grass, this earth, this air. Fellows! Fellows! Stand fast! Forward march! Fan out! Battery, fire! Every point in our position is in the enemy's hands, and we haven't the troops to drive them back. The men are fleeing and it's impossible to stop them. I did not consider I had the right to conceal from you what I saw. Our troops are in complete disorder. How dare you... How dare you, sir, tell me that? You know nothing about it. The enemy's been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right flank. If you have seen amiss, sir, then don't talk of things about which you know nothing. Will you be so kind as to go to General Barclay now and inform him of my intention to attack the French tomorrow. The enemy is defeated! Tomorrow we will drive him out of the holy land of Russia! Rayevsky! Here he is, my hero! Your Highness, our men are holding their ground firmly. The French are not venturing a further attack. Kaissarov! Sit down and write tomorrow's order of the day. And you, ride down the line and announce that tomorrow we attack. But all that evening, and next day, reports came in, one after another, of staggering losses, of the loss of half the army. And another battle proved physically impossible. ...Sleep, my baby, my Andrei... Lullaby, lullaby, Sleep, my baby, do not cry. Little birdie, don't meddle, Stop a-rocking our cradle. Lullaby, lullaby... My God! What is this? What is he doing here? Dark and somber drowsiness Visits every home and nest. Lullaby, lullaby, Sleep, my baby, do not cry. On the couch, on the bed Golden slumber in each head. Lullaby, lullaby... And not only for that hour and day were the mind and conscience darkened in that man, on whom the burden of all that had happened lay more heavily than on others. Never, down to the end of his life, had he the least comprehension of good, of beauty, of truth, of the significance of his own acts, which were too far opposed to truth and goodness, too remote from everything human for him to be able to grasp their significance. He could not disavow his own acts, that were lauded by half the world, and so he was forced to disavow truth and goodness and everything human. Enough, enough, men! Stop! Consider! What are you doing? To the men on both sides, exhausted for want of food and rest, the doubt began to come whether they should still persist in slaughtering one another. Slay whom you will, do whatever you will, but I have had enough. And yet, some unfathomable and mysterious force led these men on and kept up the fearful work, which was done independently of their wills. A moral victory, that which compels the enemy to recognize the moral superiority of his opponent, and his own impotence, was won by the Russians at Borodino. The direct consequence of the battle of Borodino was Napoleon's causeless flight from Moscow, the ruin of the invading army of five hundred thousand men, and the downfall of the Napoleonic rule, on which, for the first time at Borodino, was laid the hand of a foe of stronger spirit! End of Part Three
