Please be kinder with her Hello, Dad Here again dropping in on you all of a sudden Don't be angry. We're not going to constrain you for long Sergei? Come show yourself. Ooh, brother, you're unrecognizable Isn't it Pavel, huh? Or am I wrong? Come look at me. Are you Pavel or not? Huh? Pavel! Look at Grandpa! Say: "How do you do, Grandpa"! And you say "I don't want to look at Grandpa" - Don't want! That's right! Person says what he thinks. Well done! May I? - Come in Dad! There's a thing Well what, is it money? - Nah The thing is: I've heard Viktor Petelin is tipped on this position What Petelin? Who told you? You listen to all sorts of rubbish! Is that what you've come to me to report? - But you listen No matter who - Petelin or someone else - he'll be seeking counsel with you about the staff, right? So? For me, this is a chance - What chance? I'm 27 years old. I'm sitting with 30 rubles a month Well, who's impeding you? - You Well, fine: I no longer do - But I want you to help! What's the commotion? No, there's no commotion I've been wondering, what'll be the first thing for my eldest son to tell me on these days And he says: "It's great, Dad, that you've been fired" "Now no one will interfere with my career growth, making a career" No, my darling: you being my son isn't what's hampering you - Sergei! An able man achieves everything himself! Himself! And it's all empty talk, that someone's hindering him! - Sergei! But you took all the positions! - Nikolai! Won't yield anything to anyone! What, isn't it so? - How are you talking to the father? Do you know this saying: "Found your place in life - wait until it's vacant"? Well, vacant now! Grab it! - Sergei! Olga! Olga! Phone! Mom Andrei Zakharych Abrikosov Andrei Zakharych, it's Abrikosov Coming to you Is it true? Firstly, greetings What are you talking about? - That Petelin Yes, true Well to whom has this come to mind? Can you explain to me? Why suddenly Petelin? Ridiculous! A person without a face! Now that's too much: "without a face". Just the opposite, he's got a handsome face Maybe someone's attracted to him with this face? - Perhaps, won't rule it out And how do you think the staff's chosen? - On business grounds. That's what I think Also, I figured it wouldn't be a sin to consult with me. Somehow I could have picked you a worthy person It's not that simple - "a worthy person" A worthy person has to not only please YOU, actually probably you - the least Why's that? Because we do not need your copy. 2nd Abrikosov - what's he for? We already have one Had! - Well, "had", if you prefer If you have to change - change for something different And you found Petelin? Thanks Maybe a cup of coffee? - No Right, don't go in for it I've got 180/110 pressure, and it's already consistent Slightly below - head's bursting Our age! I'm not complaining about age yet - Well god bless you Listen, Sergei! Sit down, relax, it's flashing in my eyes because of you I think there's some emotion speaking inside you... - Well? How to say this... - Well-well? Petelin is your man You've created him. And now it's hard for you to imagine... Oh what's that got to do with it? What's that got to do with it? Petelin is a capable engineer, but then there are different natures You know as well as I There are executives. And he's a typical executive And what could he have been with you, think about it! You wouldn't have tolerated another! Isn't it so? In short, here's what I'm going to say to you It's not my idea, you understand it yourself Even more, it's no secret I advocated you, but... The minister has his own reasons. That's why he's a minister And in this case on this position he... wants to see, well, like, a person from a different generation What you gonna say! Sound idea One can no longer operate using the old methods Have you got new ones? Don't play stupid! You're fully aware of what we're talking about After all, something happens to us with age We're gaining experience, correct. But... But maybe this is actually a bad thing. What is experience? A habit. A habit for the good, but also a habit for the bad These are all your arguments or the minister's? Ours, Sergei Nikitich, ours: both his and mine And since he's the minister, and I'm working with him Drink! It's going to cool down Got a car? No, no need. I'm on foot now. Pedestrian But I'm not talking about that. Own car, "Zhiguli" No, didn't get one And the villa? Government property - Well why so? For naught All of our generation - idealistic fools. We don't think about tomorrow We think we're eternal Too soon you're writing me off, Andrei - Wait. Wait! Well who's writing you off, weird guy? Wait. Hold on a bit The minister asked about you, he's definitely going to summon you. I think he's going to offer something worthwhile Just a piece of advice: don't walk around with a bitter expression A sort of a living reproach. It'll do you no good Do you understand me? Stay healthy And Sergei? Why are you in such an outfit? No good Yes. Excuse me please. A minute Good evening - Good evening Yes? Opened the door, sorry. Well-well? It's just like him - I'll feed you Strong tea. Where's Marina? Already in bed. A child couldn't fall asleep for a long time We've made bed for them in the office, your bed's in the bedroom Yeah? - ...well ultimately I don't care. Let him assert himself all he wants It is a sort of assertion Don't see the difference. Effeminate man of our time or manly - what's the difference? Well how's one better than the other? Oh, with such a pleasure! With pleasure I would have gone there! *lists places* (muffled speech) Anywhere! (muffled speech) Thanks, yes? Probably won't be possible now, no Circumstances have changed Yeah Well this isn't a phone conversation, yeah OK Call me. Or I'll call Anyway, someone'll call Gran, had Sergei had a meal? - No, he hadn't even finished his tea Want me to give you something to read? Don't look at me What shall we do with Marina? Maybe rent a house? Yes, probably How much money do we have on a (savings) book? Do we have a book? - 1600 Not too thick, by today's standards Have you been to the ministry? - Yeah And? - Nada Turn away And with whom were you on the phone? When? - Right now Valentina Valentina? Which Valentina? My friend. You know her I think you've seen her Yeah, can't recall You've got a lot of new friends, whom I don't know Naturally, of course Give me your hand - What for? Well, I need your hand Come on, Sergei, don't play games. Enough! Let's go to sleep. I'm killing the light Gimme.

Oh why did you, let me hang it up I was now at my old friend's Wanted to have a drink to the meeting But a friend of mine for 2 years now is no longer among the living But how can that be? - Like that Let's commemorate his soul Do you have any glasses? Well, why glasses? How do you live, Sergei Nikitich? Do not live! Going to And you? - Well you know, same old for now I honestly thought that Victor Sergeievich would take another assistant So I've been told, that "all of you will be substituted" But so far no change Good - And how are you, Sergei Nikitich? I think about you all the time But stop thinking. Don't I'm fine As you see: I'm visiting acquaintances, friends Previously, I only had to deal with superiors and subordinates And now such an advantage Seeing those whom you want to see Oh, Nelly Petrovna. The way we live In this bustle one can live 20 years without meeting a familiar person Friends unseen for years Can't even find out about a passing, if on that day you missed a social And with this friend of mine... Grigori Melnikov... We lived together for many years Were friends Studied Worked He literally saved me from a bullet If you begin to remember... Why won't you drink? I generally don't drink Sergei Nikitich Well here you've lived such an interesting life Why don't you write? To just sit down and write down To be published in a luxury cover Well even if unpublished? It'll remain But really. Come visit me, I'd write down. I've got a machine there Come visit me? You know, that's dangerous! Why? One had already been visiting and visiting, and then bam and... - And what? Love, what? Well, you know, I don't think it's a threat for us You think so? - Sure I've never seen you laughing To your health Got time to read? - Nah, a little And who's this?

Igor's got guests Well, tell me! - Tell what, Dad? Well, tell me! - Tell what, Dad? *ABBA - So Long* *ABBA - So Long* Getting old - Feeling the years *ABBA - So Long* *ABBA - So Long* You, years? - Sure, how old do you think I am? *ABBA - So Long* *ABBA - So Long* Hmm *ABBA - So Long* *ABBA - So Long* Husband having a drink? *ABBA - So Long* *ABBA - So Long* In spring *ABBA - So Long* *ABBA - So Long* Why in spring? *ABBA - So Long* Who knows? *ABBA - So Long* *ABBA - So Long* How are you both? - Same as everyone *ABBA - So Long* Fine *ABBA - So Long* *ABBA - So Long* You're not asking about Mom? *ABBA - So Long* *ABBA - So Long* What is it, how is she? *ABBA - So Long* Mom's in a nursing home *ABBA - So Long* What? Why are you all so scared? Very good home - She wanted it herself. She's better off there Better than at home? - Yes, imagine! We've been living terribly recently She was irritated by everything: me, kids Especially me. And the whole time talks about death Barely anything - prepares to die The apartment's just two rooms Not exactly like your mansion! Listen, what were you fired for? I wasn't fired Well, released. Or how do they call it I await appointment Listen! Maybe enough? Sons are grown. How much does your wife do? Don't know exactly - Well, at least 300 rubles? She's a docent after all - Well I don't know You know nothing about your own house You do not love me Why? I don't know why. But you probably don't love anyone A pity. After all, you're a doctor. A medic I'm in you, Dad We both don't love anyone You're wrong I don't know, perhaps you relented with age And as for the medic, you know... - Fine Go to sleep Good night Good night *Manfred Mann's Earth Band - Mighty Quinn (Live)* Isn't it time, friends? (voices) Y'all wanna go to my place? (voices) (all, in turn) Goodbye (voices) Oh, old hag Are you asleep? Are kids home? I put a chain on the door Antokhin gave a banquet Defended finally, before 50 years old We sat in "Prague", and then went to one of our graduates 5 people split off. For tea Sergei? You're not asleep You know, Sergei, we need to do something. This won't do Pull yourself together Constant resentment for me, for children You can't live like that! Marina's been here for days! You couldn't a few words to say to her! Don't know Maybe... we'll think of something? Maybe you should go away? Get a tourist voucher - relax somehow, recover? You can't go on like that: sit and torment yourself and others! Alright! Good night What? Tomorrow? I don't know Gotta figure I'll call you later Wait What, Dad? - Sit down I want to figure out how are you going to live Why "going to"? - I'm living You need a phone? Go ahead Thanks - But it's 6 o'clock already. Everyone's probably gone Who? - From where you await a call Sorry, Dad, but I don't know how to talk to you - Why? No idea. Probably because... You hardly pay attention to a person talking to you You hear what you want to hear You know, like in music? A familiar melody. If it's unfamiliar, it won't do Listen You're 20 years old You're already married If you can call it a marriage But neither you nor your wife have a degree or serious interests in life I'm still studying, by the way "By the way" - said that right Studying, by the way Dad, if you want to give me advices, I will certainly hear them out But you know - actually, it is our habit to always offer advices to everyone Vika is a grandmaster of giving advices And you don't need advices? You know the thing is Who said it: "We give advice to those who can not take advantage of them..." "and those who can - they don't need advices"? Subtle observation. Subtle-subtle And, by the way, I'm retiring You understand that? So far this question never came up, thank goodness But you don't know how to do anything! How will you live? In what sense? In the sense of money, you mean? Well, Dad, it's no problem You can make money How? Clean the streets? So what, is that not a job? One could, by the way, as an insurance agent. I had an offer Agent? - Insurance Good job. Decent income And free time Is that important for you? Free time? - Yes, Dad, yes! You've never had it, that's why you don't know what it is: free time Excuse me, but you knew nothing, except your work Whole life for work! And not because - believe me - the job needed it. You! You needed it! Because you didn't know what to do with yourself Sunday: it's been a nightmare You don't like TV, guests bore you, idleness irritates you Idleness, yes And maybe it's not idleness at all. Maybe it's the time your soul's working! As in poetry, you know: "Soul's bound to work, day and night, night and day"? Beautiful, beautiful What are you on about? - Soul Yes, Igor, it's time to decide, really. Dad's absolutely right And Vika needs to decide for herself, well I don't know Do you plan to somehow officialize your relationship? - You're going somewhere? Yes, a concert You're not a boy anymore. At age 20, your age by the way, father received his first medal What is this concert? French pianist Why aren't you inviting me? I didn't think you find it interesting Why? I'm very interested But you were never interested in music before Well alright. I'll take it into account And here's what we've got It's yours. Been waiting for you So Have you heard about our affairs? Which? - Victor Sergeievich has big plans Well how do you like him overall? A pawn Promoted to a queen. But still a pawn Well I don't know In my opinion Victor Sergeievich has very warm feelings for you - Yeah - No, really By the way, yesterday one person (I'm not going to name him, you know him)... allowed himself to comment on the old management So Victor Sergeievich cut him short and in the presence of everyone... Let's be silent Nelly honey And are you always that devoted to your superiors, huh? Nelly honey Here's what concerns me You must know women psychology. Can I ask a question? Please Well, woman, as is known, is a creature of higher order A man is capable of living a double life. This is also known But what about a woman? What do you mean, "what about"? I don't understand what question I'm supposed to answer This question - Which question? You're probably getting the wording wrong That is quite possible - As many people there are, there are just as many emotions Alright They say, living without emotions is bad Or with petty emotions Like, say, envy And jealousy? How is that? When a person is jealous of you... Well I... I don't know what you're talking about Who's jealous of whom? - Well me! Me! Of my wife Well, I guess, you don't have grounds for this No grounds? Right Yes, I've found your speech from the congress for party economics It's there, on the table - Oh throw it out! Got a folding bed? Oh what folding bed, Sergei Nikitich? You're going home now What if I beg? - But no, no, Sergei Nikitich Well, by god, I'm not going to encroach upon your woman's honor! What's the interest then? Please leave, Sergei Nikitich! Let's get out of here, I'm serious Goodbye Ludmila honey! Clean these please How do you do - Howdy Howdy, Sergei Nikitich Sergei Nikitich? What's this: you, here? I love dumplings You don't recognize me? Something familiar Familiar? But you dismissed me from my job How, dismissed? - Well, then, well, discharged Fired, sacked. How else? Well at the time I still had a small beard. We had two with a beard: me and Victor Petelin Gurenov? Is Victor still there, Not dismissed? Nah Laughter failed me hard Laughter? - Jokes Don't recall? - No "Very appropriate surname, rhymes well" So-so-so? OK, better let's have a drink Want a drink? But, do they serve? But of course Ludmila honey - Yes? Ludmila honey, we could use some mineral, 150 each Well come on, come on, Ludmila honey - Alright Curious So how did you rhyme me? I did, Sergei Nikitich! Was a time - Thanks Once you asked: "Who's such a joker?" And that's it. No more Gorenov Really don't recall? Weird You're a pitiful person. If you don't take a liking to someone, then... Is that the reputation I've got? Yeah You're on the other side of the table, and we're on this one Difference, after all, Nikitich From the other side the world is seen differently. Different scale To your health Well, aren't you a philosopher So where do you dwell, philosopher? - There, opposite What's that? - Metal repair I just fix umbrellas You're an engineer! With a degree. Umbrellas? What, went after the money? Yeah, and besides there's not much of an authority In an extreme case, you can even tell them to piss off You don't like our profession, brother. - Well, what for, Sergei Nikitich? So I didn't kick you out for nothing Not for nothing, Sergei Nikitich, not for nothing Ludmila honey - Yes? We could you use more mineral - No, boys We're closing, that's enough - Oh Ludmila! No-no, boys What to do, huh? How about we continue? Where? - There is a place Won't regret it So what? - Well what, "so what"? They won't worry at home? Family's, I suppose, in the country What exactly are you offering? - Comrade Abrikosov, do not be asking questions! (this rhymes in russian) We made your bed in your office And Marina? They left How, "left"? Where to? Summer camp She got a job there a doctor. She's got some friend there What, Mom? Dad, you do not need anything? No Good night Howdy, Sergei Nikitich How do you do I've been to the house, none of you are in Let's go So, that's it, comrades. That's it That's good.

Wanna stop it for a while Make an institution out of it What, won't let me? Come on, try it It was in fact one of my conditions, when I was appointed here You put conditions? - Of course But here's a problem, Sergei Nikitich... We don't decide anything, no one wants to decide, to take responsibility After all, not accustomed to, not to offend you Look here. According to science I, as the director, should have a maximum of 10 people, with which to deal directly. 10 How much do I have? Information's most inaccurate Everybody lies They to me, me to someone else. No good Shouldn't this be remedied? Go ahead, remedy. According to science (?) Sergei Nikitich, I'm not appealing to you on account of myself I can't compete with you It's a special gift - to subjugate people - timely to alienate, timely to bring closer It wasn't given to me But I want people to somehow move, think, solve Go ahead, try I'll try, Sergei Nikitich And if I fail - I'll leave.
