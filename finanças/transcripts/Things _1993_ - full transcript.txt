(dramatic music) - [Jane] Oh, Jack, yes, yes, Jack, yes! (moaning) - Number 33, wow! Wait till the guys in the coffee room hear abour her. I'll show 'em this time. (moaning) - Jack. (moaning) Jack. Who the hell are you? - You might say I'm with a collection agency. - What? - You borrowed something of mine. - What? - My husband. - Your husband? - Boy, I see your brains are packed as solidly as your breasts. Jack, the accountant you just screwed, or don't you remember that far back? - He didn't say anything at all about being married. - Oh, and would it have mattered if he had? - Would what have mattered? - Look, just tell me your name. - Why would I do that? - Because I have a loaded gun. - Jane Lawson, please don't shoot, no! - Lawson. Is that with an 'on' or an 'en'? - An 'on'. - Okay, Jane, get up. - What? - Boy, he really can pick 'em. Read my lips, dear. Get up and sit in this chair. Are you gonna sit in this chair or am I gonna blow your fucking brains out? - Okay, okay! What are you doing? - This is a rope, Jane. I'm tying you up. - You're crazy! What are you gonna do with me? - What do you think? You do think once in a while, don't you, Jane? - [Jane] Are you gonna kill me? - I'm going to tell you two stories and after I've finished you get to review them. Your fate, shall we say, will depend entirely upon those reviews. Don't lie to me, Jane, I always know when people are lying to me, especially bimbos like you. - I'm not a bimbo! - Shut up and listen! The first story concerns a box. You might say people have been dying to know what's in it. Once upon a time, there were three little prostitutes. You ought to like this one. They were moving to a desolate little mining town in Nevada. (slow disco music) - Hey man, here come the whores, dude! (guys chattering) - [Man] Oh, man, look at them! Look at that blondie! Come on, get out of the car, come on. - Hey, baby! (guys chattering) - [Daisy] You gotta be kidding me. There's just one door to this joint, is that it? - [Sherry] Well now, honey, it's our home we can put in another door. We can put in 20 doors if we feel like it. - We'll make it our home. - Yes, honey, we'll make it our home. The theater's right ahead here and our rooms are upstairs. This is a nice, old theater. Wouldn't you say, girls? I bet we can perform very nicely here. - Yeah, as long as we're on our backs in time for the climax. (Sherry laughs) Right, Tulip? (ominous music) What a fucking dump. - [Mayor] Who wears the hat in this town, Ernie? - You do, Mayor Black. - [Mayor] Then why did you sell them the old theater? You know how I hate sin. - I didn't know they were ladies of the night, they tricked me! - When you first decided to bring a theater to this town I thought, what an excellent idea. Art, culture. We can have that. One man! (Ernie screaming) - Boss, I'll do anything! I'll get them to go! - They signed a contract. You let them move into the very place where I trained him. Easy, my friend, easy. Soon, my friend, soon. Soon. My poor friend. Never to see the beauty of the world. Never to see the sunlight. Never to see the flowers. I love flowers. (crying) Don't you, Ernie? (screaming) - Please, Mayor, let me go! I'll get you money, anything! - I have everything I need. If I were you, (laughs) I'd start saying my prayers. - No! (crying) No! Oh my, God! (screaming) (wailing) (squishing) (screaming) No! (slurping) - [Man] Why do they call her Tulip? - She's a flower. My name's Daisy. I'm a flower, too. - Wait, why can't she start work until tomorrow? I mean, she doesn't have disease or something, does she? - Hey, are you paying to talk or what? - I just, I can't stop thinking about Tulip. I mean, you know, the miners are gonna line up for her. And I'm gonna be right there in front. Hope you're gonna be open tomorrow. - Why wouldn't we be open tomorrow? - Mayor Black is the man with the hat. - The man with the hat? Is that some sort of slang that miners use? - Mayor Black has his way around in this town and he says only the man in charge should be wearing a hat. Yeah, a few have tried to wear one but they, they disappeared. - That's crazy! Why would he care if someone wore a hat or not? - Well, just don't be calling him crazy, even if he is. If the man in charge should be wearing a hat who am I to disagree? - I don't think I'm gonna like it here. - I don't think you're gonna be here very long, anyway. The mayor gets a little high and mighty and if he wants you out he was gonna take his little box here and you'll be out. - What box, huh? What are you talking about? - You'll find out soon enough. - Now Tulip, honey, you just keep telling yourself I am doing the right thing. I'm doing the right thing. After the first time it'll all seem much easier. More natural, it's just a natural act. - Do you really think this could lead to my big break? - Oh, honey, there's a good chance. You meet a lot of politicians in this business. - You really think I could meet one, a senator or a governor? (laughs) - Well, anything's possible. And one thing's for sure, you have a much better shot at it here than you do where I found you, scrubbing floors and waiting on tables. - I don't feel right in this place. I mean, there's no windows on the ground floor and there's a bolt on the door. It's as if someone wants to keep us in. - Tulip, honey, don't you waste another second worrying about this place. I will take that bar off tomorrow morning and we'll put some windows in here. We'll make it our home. Now, let's make sure you are ready for tomorrow morning. Each man gets one hour. If you go even a second over you charge him for another hour. And arch your back when you stand, oh, yes. It accentuates your assets. (laughs) Now, Tulip, honey swing your hips when you walk. (sexy music) That's it. Swing your hips Tulip, honey. God gave you the goods, use them. (gasps) - I'm Mayor Black. Are you the new owner of this theater? - I am. My name is Sherry Leroux. What can I do for you, Mayor? - This town maintains strict moral standards and when you bought this theater your intentions were not made clear. - I have a permit. - Only I wear a hat in this town. The man with the hat owns the box. The man with the hat makes the rules! (laughs) - The real estate agent did not tell me about the mad hatter. - He won't make that mistake again. I require a city license for prostitution. You don't have one. I expect you to be out by morning. - Prostitution is legal in this state and I have a license to prove it. I have been around the block, honey. You can't pull any tricks on me. (ominous music) And I own this theater and you are trespassing. I suggest you leave now and give me back my hat or I will press charges. - Well, press charges, then. Although I'm sure the judge would be very partial to my side of the story seeing as how he and I are very good friends. We're close. In fact, it's me. (laughs) - Mayor, are you interested? She starts work tomorrow. - I don't pay for sin. - Well, seeing as how you are the man with the hat maybe we could arrange a deal where you wouldn't have to pay. - What's your name, child? - Tulip. - You don't belong here, Tulip. I could take you away. Protect you. - (laughs) How many times do you think she's heard that line before? - I could protect you from the box. - Tulip, honey, when a man comes along with real power and wealth you can go with him, use him, but don't waste yourself on this one. - I have the power here, I have the box. - Go back to the kitchen, honey. - [Mayor] Stay with me, Tulip. - I think you should leave. - You'll be sorry, Tulip. You'll both be sorry. - Yes! (moaning) (alarm ringing) Your hour's up. (man moaning) Care to try again? - No, I think I'll wait till tomorrow when the place is really open. - We're open now. - Then I wanna see Tulip! - What is it with Tulip? - I don't know. I mean, she's a looker and all that, but it's just there's more to it than that. - You only saw her for a minute. - I know, it's just, she's everything beautiful in this stinkin' world. She's like music and flowers and sunsets. It's crazy, isn't it? She's got me talking like some sissy. - She's just a hooker! - Look, I know. When you're down there in the mines every day, all day. I mean, it's dark and you start dreaming. You start dreaming about somebody like Tulip. - I'm sick of hearing about Tulip! I'll tell you what you can do with Tulip! - Look, I know what I can do with Tulip. I just hope the mayor doesn't get to you all first. (wind rushing) (dramatic music) (coughing) - Damn things are gonna kill me. (laughing) (rattling) (screams) - Miss Leroux? Miss Leroux? (screams) (dramatic music) (tapping phone) Oh, God! - [Daisy] Oh, Jesus Christ! - She's dead! - What the hell happened to her? - I don't know. - Call the police! (banging) Goddamn, we're locked in! - Who would do something like this? - Anybody in this town could have done it. I knew I never should have taken this job! - Mayor Black had something to do with this. He has the power, the thing in the box is not human! - What the hell are you talking about? - We're locked in here! It wants to kill us, it's going to kill us! It's going to kill us! (slapping) Why did you hit me so hard? - Whoever did this must still be in here. I'm gonna find him and kill him before he kill us. - I told you, it's the thing from the box that did it. Mayor Black was here earlier. He said whoever owns the box rules this town. - Yeah, my last John said something about a box, too. You know, this place is too crazy for me. Sounds like it's right up your alley, though. (crashing) Whatever it is, I'm sure this knife will put a nice dent in it. - Maybe we should get up off the floor. - What difference does it make? - You want to live, don't you? - Yeah, we're living here, anyway. - I'm gonna be someone important some day, a politician. - Would you give me a break with the politician bullshit? The closest you'll ever get to a politician is sharing a bed with one. - Don't you think I'd make a good politician? I'm honest, fair, I care about people. - Yeah, just your average fair and honest politician. - Why don't you like me? I never hurt you. - Look, I'm sure you'd make a good politician. It never hurts to set your goals high. - You really think so? - No! Well, that's what you wanted to hear, isn't it? - I want to hear the truth. - A hooker for President. Vote for me and I'll screw you for free. - Miss Leroux said a few call girls have become senators. - She would have told you anything you want to hear. You would have been the best meal ticket she ever had. Now, you have some real control over men. - She was my friend. Ever since I was six years old and my father... Men have always done things to me. They have always controlled me. - It's because you don't know how to use them. - You don't understand! When I got my first job as a waitress my boss kept me late and on the second night he... (crying) I want to become a politician so I can make the laws. I want power, I want to protect us! (crying) (screams) There! - Stay here! - [Tulip] Why? - Because if someone opens that door one of us has to be here. - Well, who would come to the door at this-- - Stay here! - You shouldn't go alone! - Don't worry about me, that thing's nothing but a pathetic piece of shit. - Daisy, wait! I have a feeling about this creature. That it could kill us right now if it wanted to. - It's just a big slug! - It's playing a game with us. I know this sounds strange, but (laughs) I think it's flirting. - Look, you gotta pull it together! You know what I mean? - You think I'm crazy. (laughs) - You've been through a lot. We both have, we can get through it. - Daisy. You're the only friend I have now. - I'll be right back. (ominous music) (dramatic music) (crashing) (door creaking) (steps creaking) (ominous music) (chilling music) (dramatic music) (screaming) - I didn't see you. - How did you get in here? - I took the bolt off the door. There's another door in the hall. - Please help us, the thing is here! - I'm not getting involved! - Please, I'll do anything! Anything! (ominous music) (gurgling) (screaming) Daisy! (screaming) (thrashing) (gasping) Be careful. (screaming) - [Man] Get it off! (creature slurping) (screaming) - Going somewhere, Tulip? Sit down, Tulip. I've loved you from the first moment I laid eyes on you. But you know that, don't you? - Why did you do it? - The men in this town live by my rules. A place like this will only bring 'em down. - But people are dead. You're responsible! - You all had your chance to follow my rules. - And they say I'm crazy. But you're the crazy one! - All great leaders have left people in the dust! You remember that! No matter how much respect they command. No matter how many memorials or schools that go in their names, they all have blood on their hands. It goes with the job. - You're no leader. You're a leech! Just like the thing in the box! - This is your last chance. Come with me now. I can give you a life where you'll never have to work. No one will ever harm you. - Wait! Before I die, just tell me what it is. - I found him in the mines. - Him? - I raised him, trained him, right here in this theater. - The bolt on the door was to keep him in. - He lives on coal, but he likes the taste of blood. He was surprisingly easy to train. - You trained him so he won't attack anyone wearing a hat. - Join me, you can wear a hat. - I could never be like you. - Don't be too sure! You, too, might thirst for blood once you've had a taste. I have everything I want. I have everything I need. - Everything, except me. (yelling) - What is it? What is your power over me? Is it just me or do all men lose their minds at the sight of you? (thudding) (groaning) - Are you afraid to watch me die? Well, live with this; I would rather die than spend one hour with you! They call me Tulip. Miss Leroux said that I have the gift of the flower. I can open my buds at the sun. I don't think I've ever blossomed. I don't want to hurt you. I'm just looking for a place to call home. A place with beauty and love. I'm looking for a place out of the darkness. I know you must be looking, too! Don't you understand me? I want to help you! We could help each other. (chilling music) (wind rushing) (wolf howling) - Tulip? (chilling music) (yelling) (slurping) (country music) (slurping) - So, what do you think? - I think you have a twisted and warped imagination. - Twisted and warped, good! No one's ever used those adjective before, I like them. - No one, you mean you've done this before? - Done what? I'm just sharing some of my imaginative access. You happen to be a captive audience, that's all. - Look, if I'm not back at the lab, they're gonna miss me, I'm very punctual. - And where did you tell your colleagues you would be? Out screwing my husband? - If you're so damn smart, how come Jack sought me out? - He's stupid. - And you're not, holding me hostage here? - And just who knows you're here, Miss Ph.D? I somehow doubt you left this tar pit as your emergency number. So tell me, Janie dear, who's the stupid one here? - Look, I'm tired, my head hurts, I'm thirsty and I'm sick of sitting here fucking naked! - Oh, well said, college grad. But I still have one more story to tell. - [Gen] I don't remember when Leon and I first met, but we were married within a year. I'd never been happier in my life. Everything seemed wonderful until Leon lost his old job and then something changed. Everything changed. In small ways you might not notice, but that you could feel. My father had never liked Leon and now I started to wonder. What had started in daylight would end in a nightmare. (creepy music) (crickets chirping) What, what do you want? - Come on, baby, daddy's lonely. Daddy needs you. - [Gen] It's the middle of the night. - Oh, what fucking difference does time make? - We've already done it twice. - Oh, you're keeping count? Am I on an allowance? I want some love and I gotta ask your permission all of a sudden? Listen, I earn the money. I pay for this house, I pay for the yard. I pay for the food and I pay for this bed. And I ain't gonna ask what I can and can't do when I'm at home. - No, don't hit me, please! - The fucking Queen of Sheba, you are! All you gotta do all day is three things; eat, shit and fuck! Yeah, it's that fucking Beverly bitch, isn't it? Huh? She's putting ideas into your head that I'm a loser, that you ought to dump me! - No honey, no! Okay, you're right about Beverly, you're right about everything. I was just, you know, sleepy before, I didn't know what I was saying. Besides, you know how long it takes for my motor to start running. But you've got it purring along in high gear, now. What could I have been thinking? Three time in one night with a tiger like you? - Oh, forget it! I'm not in the mood anymore. Thinking of that Beverly chick has ruined the whole thing. Is she quite happy now? - Sorry, honey. Can we try it again? - Oh, forget it. Just shut up and don't even talk to me. - So you're just gonna lay there like that all night? - Like what? Like what? (ominous music) Just what are you looking at, bitch? What are you looking at? You know I'm tired of you always looking at me? Always looking at me. I'm gonna make sure you're not looking at anything for a while. (muffled crying) (crunching) (phone ringing) - Hello, Bev? I know it's late. It happened again. - Another nightmare? This can't go on. - This is the worst one yet. Leon was so angry he cut out my eyes. God, it was horrible! - Listen, kid, dreams are how we talk to ourselves. Pay attention, huh? Get away from the guy. - But it was just a dream. You know, all warped and exaggerated. Just a horrible dream. - This time, sure, but next time it may be real. Then it'll be too late. - [Leon] Who are you talking to? - I gotta go, Bev, I'll talk to you tomorrow. - You calling Bev for advice? That cunt. - No, Leon, I wasn't. - Yeah, you woke me up! - [Gen] I was just-- (cracking) - Maybe that will stop you talking on the phone late at night. And stop your moaning and your bitching, arguing and complaining, or I'll stop it for good! (spitting) (gargling) What is it? - Nothing. - If you're dreaming, I hope it's about me. - Sure, honey. - It better be. How about some breakfast? (creepy tinkling music) (sizzling) - It happened again last night. This was the worst one yet, he was pulling out my eyes. - Hey come on, where's my breakfast? - Be right there. I don't know, I must be hallucinating or something. I can't seem to stop them. (gasping) - [Bev] What is it, Jen? - Look, I've gotta go. - [Bev] Meet me for lunch, we can talk more. - Sure, say noon at Pappy's? See you then. Here you go, hon. Your last home-cooked meal for the next couple of days. - It's about time. Whoa, this again. - Well, it's your favorite. - That doesn't mean that I have to have it every day. Besides, you don't fix it right. (coughing) Where's my coffee? You expect me to choke to death on this shit? - I'll get it. - I hope that isn't instant. I get instant on the airplane. I sure hope that isn't-- (coughing) What is this weed doing in my food? - It's parsley, honey, you're not supposed to-- (yelling) I'm sorry honey, I'm sorry honey, I'm sorry! - What are you doing? Just stop it, will you? Just stop it. I am leaving in 10 minutes to catch a plane to go to the most important meeting of my life and you help me by ruining my shirt! What the hell is the matter with you? - You're hurting me! - Oh, I am, huh? Well, let's see what I can do about that. You stick this poisonous weed in my food and now you ruin a $50 dollar shirt! - It was parsley. Ow, my hand! - Oh, this hand, this hand that takes and takes and throws and destroys and breaks and breaks! (crunching) - The last was just this morning, like a daydream. I don't know what's happening to me. - [Bev] I do. Ever hear of precognition? It's people who can see the future in their dreams. - [Jen] Oh, come on! - No, really! They'll dream something and it comes true. Only most of the time they don't know what the dream means until after it happens. Right here, a woman who lives miles from her son and she has a recurring dream that he stood in front of her and said, "Ma, I'm coming." Well, just like that he falls apart; arms, head everything. What does she think? That she's overworked or bad pizza, whatever. Anyway, you know what happened? - Sure, they sell their story to that sleazy rag and retire. - Two days later her son's decapitated in a car accident. He was on his way to visit her. - Disgusting, so what? Are there any good UFO stories in that issue? - I thought you were scared of your dreams. I didn't come here to play straight man. - I am scared, I'm terrified. - If that woman had listened to her dreams and warned her son, it could have been avoided. That's what you have to do, listen to these dreams. - Mine aren't that simple. Leon's not really like that, it's not-- - Oh, really? I think he is. Maybe not exactly like in the dreams, but he's a fucking, fucking loose cannon. You've got to get as far away from him as you can as soon as you can. Don't listen to me, listen to yourself. You have to do this. - If Leon catches me, he'll kill me. - [Bev] Don't worry. He's away off in Chicago, on business or something? - For three days. - Perfect, do it today. - You make it sound so easy. - It is. First go to the bank withdraw everything. - [Jenny] Everything? - Mmhmm. In cash, you don't want to leave a trail of canceled checks or credit card receipts behind. In fact, destroy all your cards and open new accounts under a different name. - Everything? That'd be just like stealing, the money belongs to both of us. - Both of you? Look kid, it's your money. That louse didn't have a pot to piss in when he married you. And anything he's earned off that so-called real estate career is just simple interest on the heartache he's caused you. This is what you're gonna live on, girl. Grab it and run! - Where will I go? - Who cares? Don't tell anyone, not even me. As long as Leon's not there it's the place for you. - The car needs some work before a long trip. - Uh uh, don't take the car. It could be traced if he hires a detective or reports it stolen. Don't fly either, take a bus and pay cash for the ticket. - He calls once every night when he's out of town. I guess he wants to make sure I'm not out with someone while he's gone. - What time does he call? - Seven, sharp. - Is that the only time he calls? Perfect. Go to the bank, go home and pack and wait for his call. When you hang up leave. By the time he calls the next night you'll have a 24 hour head start. He'll never find you. - I don't know if I can do this. - What are you gonna do, wait for Mr. Wonderful to dissect you? I'll come around after work to help you pack, okay? A kind of moral support. It's your decision, kid. - Thanks, Bev. I keep thinking about something Leon said a long time ago. - What was that? Hey bitch, where's dinner? - It happened just after we were married. Leon took me out to this fancy restaurant. We were sort of out of place. Neither one of us had ever been to a restaurant like that before. Maybe that's what made him do it. Well anyway, Leon thought that the waiter was paying too much attention to me, making a pass at me, and when the waiter asked him what the problem was... (punching) - [Waiter] No, no, no! (screaming) - Leon grabbed him and just beat him senseless. Right there in front of everybody. - I guess that's why you always eat in. Jesus, you should have seen this coming sooner. - When we got home that night, Leon said that he'd kill me if I ever left him for someone else. You know what I told him? - What? - Ditto. - Boy, if Tarzan doesn't get the message sooner, he's sure to know when he sees your closet. We're talking Mother Hubbard, here. - I never realized I had so much stuff. - Oh, geez. (laughs) Oh, now that's too important to leave behind. - My dad gave it to me before he died. - Oh, what do you put in it? - Nothing. I never found anything that was just right. Have to be something really special. So now we wait. Leon calls, I lie to him, leave without a trace and never see him again. - Oh, come on, he's been asking for this for years and now he's gonna get it. After all, he likes to get what he wants, doesn't he? (phone ringing) Go ahead. - Hello, honey. - [Leon] Any calls? - No, did you get in alright? - [Leon] Yeah, I hate Chicago. It's like a toilet with windows. Who needs it? - Your flight was alright? - [Leon] I said it was fine. Now what are you up to? - [Jen] Nothing. I knew you'd call, I was just waiting. - [Leon] Nobody else there, is there? - No, I was just watching Jeopardy. You know, doing nothing, as usual. - [Leon] But Beverly, she's not there, is she? - No. - [Leon] Good, she's probably out fixing someone else's life. You know, I don't like her messing with your mind while I'm not there. - I told you, I'm alone. - [Leon] Alright, I'll call you again tomorrow night. - Goodbye, honey. I love you. (phone buzzing) - I hope this next bag's as heavy as that last one. My back's really enjoying this. - Well, I did it. - No, you're doing it. Next stop, bus to anywhere. - Can you wait outside for a me? - Sure. - I just need a minute to say goodbye. - Take all the time you need, honey. I'll come back for that last bag. - Thanks. - Hey, come on, Gen, let's go! My spine's breaking under this pressure. Hey, check this out. I'm really getting buff lugging your bags. (laughs) - Goodbye, nightmares. - God, do I just love this portable phone. (screaming) I got home a little early, since I never left. You look surprised. (grunting) (screaming) (crashing) - Beverly, help! - How does this look? - What are you doing? - Getting ready to screw your husband after we finish screwing you. (screaming) (grunting) (slicing) - Why, why? - For the money. Of course, the sex wasn't bad either. - Wouldn't want us to live in poverty now, would you? (both laughing) - Okay, okay, okay let's go. You know the drill. - Uh huh. - Give me it, come on. - Oh, I'll give it to you. - Come on. - I dress like her, I make sure everyone sees me get on the bus. I get on the midnight bus to Tulsa. - And? - I get off at the first stop. - Which is Blythe. - Uh huh. - Alright. I'm gonna weigh Gen's body down, I'm gonna throw it in the river on the way to pick you up. - Mmhmm. - Okay? - Mmhmm. - Good, let's go. - Everyone will say, poor baby, runaway wife left with all the money and disappeared into the night. (laughs) Poor lonely, Leon. Do we really have to wait a year? - Yeah. - Do we really have to wait a year? - Yeah. Let's give it a year. When everyone's forgotten about it we can sell off this joint and we'll move wherever you desire. Come on, let's go to the living room. - No, let's do it in front of her. - It doesn't matter to her anymore. - It matters to me. (thudding) Leon! (thudding) What'd she do with the goddamn cash? Leon. Oh! Oh Jesus, she dreamed about this. - Her hands, her eyes and her teeth. If they ever find the body, these are what's gonna give us away. (gasps) Hey, do you understand? Yeah? - Fingerprints, eye color, dental records. Sure, they're all on file. If they found her, I know it'd lead them to us. (crunching) I'm ready to go. I looked everywhere, I still can't find the cash. - You looked everywhere? - Yes. Oh! - She finally found a use for this stupid thing. I've got a better idea. Now I add a little acid for insurance. (bubbling) - [Bev] What's it say? - No, it's nothing. I always told her not to listen to you. - We'd better go. She's got a bus to catch. What are you doing? - Well, we can't move away and leave Geneva behind. - Don't even joke about that. I'll be in the shower. - [Leon] I'll join, digging's dirty work. (grunting) (crickets chirping) (creepy laughing) (woman moaning) (bubbling) (squishing) (screaming) (squirting) (screaming) (dripping) - Come on in, baby, I'm ready for you. (breathing heavily) What's wrong? You know I don't like to wait for what I want. Are you hurt, sweetie? - [Leon] Daddy's home. Daddy needs you. - Leon! (screaming) No, no! (screaming) (clock ticking) (ominous music) (slurping) (water rushing) - It was this morning. There's no positive ID's on the bodies yet. Without the hands or teeth we never know who the woman was. We're assuming the man was the homeowner, a Leon something or other. His wife left him last year. - Looks like his luck went from bad to worse. - You guys, come on, it's over here. I gotta tell you, it's a pretty weird one. Ever tell you guys the story about the time we found a human head in a microwave? - No, what about it? - There was this head and it was in a microwave. - And? - That's it. Anyway, this is a lot weirder than that. Looks like heavy rains flooded the creek, lifted her up here. She was probably dumped in the river up there. Now, the water's pretty cold so we can figure a certain amount of refrigeration, but I'll tell you something, it really doesn't explain this. The rest of the body's badly decomposed, but the hands and the eyes, well, it's like they're fresh. Now, I was able to lift a good set of prints so we should be able to find out who she is. In fact, both her hands have recently been reattached, actually, melted back onto the body. You know, it's like somebody wanted us to be able to identify her. But what's really weird, she had a death grip on this. - There's something inside. (creepy laughter) - You've got to choose one, now! - Okay, okay the thing in the box, that was the most disgusting. - That's all I needed to know. Now, we can get out of here. - You're letting me go? - Not yet, not until we take a little ride. There's something I simply must show you. You'll drive. (ominous music) Please drive, bitch! - Where are we, what are we doing here? - Let me ask you a question, Jane. Do you think you're the first slut Jack's picked up during our marriage? - I don't know and I don't care. What does that have to do with anything? - You're not, you know. The first slut, I mean. By Jack's own accounting you're number 33, and Jack is good at accounting, I'll give him that. - What are you talking about? - Poor Jack, he tells all the guys at work all about his conquests, but then never gets to follow through with any of them. There's never any proof because there's never any mistress. So all the guys at work think he's full of shit. Which he is, by the way. Step back. The reason Jack always needs a new mistress is because I just happen to have all the old ones right here. (muffled screaming) I knew you'd pick that story. Do you know that 28 out of every 32 women surveyed choose the thing in the box? (shuffling) These were Jack's first two indiscretions. I have an idea. What do you say we have a little fun? Let's have it pick its next victim at random. (slurping) Your turn will come, Janie. (women screaming) One day! (door creaking) (sinister music) (country music) (sinister music) (dramatic music) - [Jane] That was sick and disgusting. - [Wife] Sick and disgusting. Oh, I write everything down, Jack taught me that.
