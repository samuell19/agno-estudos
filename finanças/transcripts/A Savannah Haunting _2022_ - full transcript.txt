I would come and visit Mark here in Savannah when he moved back. We realised that there were so many supernatural things that had happened here in the past that we should write a script based on that story, so um, Mark went to work on writing the script from all real experiences that people have had in the home. This happened all the time. I would be downstairs sleeping, and uh, a noise would wake me up. It was a... a banging noise. Someone walking, distinctive, someone walking with boots on a hardwood floor directly above me. I have chills. I I'd lay there, not wanting to wake dad up wanting, you know, just lay there and then it would get to me. It would just be too much, and it would continue, it would get louder. I'd finally go wake dad up, run in his room and... and... And tell him there's somebody upstairs. He uh, would grab his gun and run up the stairs uh, and never saw anyone. Mama! Mama! Mama, help me! Where are you? Mama, where are you? Okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Another nightmare? Well, I can't wait for you guys to see the house. It's in the middle of nowhere. That's part of the charm. Oh dear God. Hey, watch your step. Is this cool or what? You have got to be kidding me. April, enough. I think it's cool, dad. Thank you, buddy. Do you like it? It's filthy, but gorgeous. I love it. Mmm. I promised you a beautiful house. Not a clean one. Hey, why don't you guys go check out your bedrooms? Through that door, immediate right, at the end of the hall. I'm gonna show your mom upstairs. Can we see upstairs? Uh, not yet. Still got some work to do, make sure it's safe. So this could be game room. Put a pool table over here, maybe a table for board games. That sounds good. - Yeah? - Hmm. Alright, come on, more to see. You know, with a little TLC this room will be beautiful. It'll take a little more than that. And since we're starting from scratch, you can design it however you want. It's freezing in here. Once we get the insulation put in, it's gonna be fine. But it's a hundred degrees outside. It's an old house. Old houses have cold drafts. Once we get a little work done, it will be perfect. Promise. This is going to cost a fortune. Honey, you don't get a four-bedroom house on our budget if it doesn't need a little bit of work. Why didn't the last owners finish the house? Hmm. Who knows. Ran out of money. Their loss our gain. Ooh, you're sexy when you're heartless. Oh boy. What? I'm sorry I don't have a nicer breakfast for my big strong men. But I promise, as soon as I am done unpacking this kitchen, I am going to make you a giant stack of blueberry pancakes. Hmm, that sounds wonderful. Mm hmm. I like burritos. And I'm gonna try to get home as soon as possible, help you unpack. No, don't rush. Just focus on making a good impression. And you, young man, you better behave yourself at school today. Honey, don't you wanna get a little dressed up today? No. You might meet some cute boys at school. Everyone says that boys from Savannah are real gentlemen. - Doubtful. - I'll be in the car. Really? Cute boys? We don't have enough problems as it is. Mmm, what uh? Get to work. Thank you. You, let's go. Bye. Get your bag. Alright, come on. Have fun. Alright, I have heard some really great things about this school. And I think you guys are gonna make some good friends here. I already have great friends. Back home. I already made a friend. Alright, come on, get to school. Oh, fellas. Hey buddy, glad to finally have you on board. -James Wellen. -Eric Rancourt. Appreciate it. Heard you're coming to us all the way from sunny California. What, you got tired of all the fruits and nuts? No, not exactly. Uh, work dried up after the housing market took a shit. This was the best offer I got. Well, you'll definitely have your hands full with all of the historical, societal regulations of this place. City's not too fond of changing things. Yeah, yeah. It'll be a challenge. But I really like fixing up these old houses. Mm. Well, good thing seeing as I heard you just moved into that old place on uh... What, Fort Argyle Road. Yeah, it's a little rough around the edges, but it's a nice house. I'm just glad to see someone's finally in it. Been empty as long as I can remember. Dr. Pettimore referred me to someone here in Savannah. Said he was really good. So I made an appointment for later this week. That's great, honey. I have really good feeling about this move. Me too. Me too. Sweetie, time to get up. Dammit, Andrew! Stop taking things out of the trash! - Bye, sweetie. - Have fun at school. Yeah, right. She'll come around. - I hope so. - I love you. I love you. Hey, sweetie, I love you and I'm sorry that I yelled at you. She doesn't like the dark. What? Would you hurry up! Bye, mom. You know the difference between a city boy and a country boy? No. A city boy walks up and sticks it in. Whereas a country boy sticks it in and walks up. That's not funny. Then why are you laughing? Okay, it's a little funny. But it's certainly not appropriate. Oh, it ain't known to be appropriate. You got any plans tonight? Other than watching American Idol reruns? Nope. Why don't you and your wife come over for dinner? Rachel needs to meet some women here and give you a chance to see the house. Sounds good to me. - Hello. - Hey, babe. Hi, um... Look, I invited a friend and his wife to dinner tonight. Yeah. Um, the house is a mess. No, the house is fine. And you know, I have my doctor's appointment - this afternoon. - It'll be fine. - Alright, we need to meet new people. - Yeah. I can... I can pull something together, no problem. Okay. - Just honey, a little more notice next time. Okay, babe, sure. Okay, thanks. Alright, I love you. Love you. Great. Rachel, what brings you to Savannah? We were looking for a fresh start. So, when my husband was offered a job here, we thought "Why not?" Fresh start usually has more to do with you as a person than where you're living. I suppose. We suffered a tragedy in our old home. And it just reached a point where I... I couldn't stay there any longer. What was the tragedy? We lost our little girl. I'm so sorry to hear that. We have... We had twins, Andrew and Alice. She had just turned 7 when it happened. Loss of a child is a devastating event. How is your family coping? The last six months have been really, really hard. Everything changed after she died. It's understandable. How have things been since the move? Better. Things seem better. Rachel, listen, I don't care what Eric says about you, you are a great cook. Yeah. Do you have any idea how hard it is being married to a comedian? A bad one at that. Oh, burn. Well, I think you are a very lucky woman, Vanessa. - Huh? - Now, you hear that, babe? She said, you basically hit the lottery when you caught me. - Caught you? - Yeah. Um, as I recall, you chased me down for three months before I finally decided to go out on a date with you. Some details. So Vanessa, James says you have a very colorful family. Oh yeah, uh well, they're black. I didn't mean that, that's not what I meant. I'm kidding, man. Well, my family was brought here from West Africa. And damn good recipes for black-eyed peas ain't the only thing they carried with 'em. What do you mean? Oh, they brought their ancient African religion. Really? Oh yes. And it is still here. My grandmother, she's a Hoodoo priestess. She has what they call, "the shine". The shine? That crazy old woman thinks she sees things. Like things that ain't there. It's true. She can see into the spirit world. Okay. That's cool. You don't... you don't... You don't believe that stuff, though, right? I don't believe it, I know it. Vanessa, babe, don't start. He asked. Okay, yeah, 'cause she think she got them magical powers, too. Okay, they're not magical powers. I'm just more spiritual. So, I can sense things. Not like my grandmother, but little things. Like what? Well, that's hard to describe. Um, you know, how sometimes you think you might see something move out of the corner of your eye? - I guess. - Sure, yeah. Well, my grandmother taught me to look at it. To actually see it. You know how some men say that their wives are crazy. Mine's is like actually crazy, like actually. No, I don't think it's crazy. I actually think it's kind of beautiful. Oh my God! - Oh. - Oh, buddy. Oh. Come here, here. Come on. Okay, sweetie, come on. Are you feeling better? You made her angry, mama. Who, baby? How are you doing, sport? I'm okay, dad. - You up for dessert? - Yes, sir. Alright. Thanks you for coming over. Absolutely, man. Vanessa, it's a pleasure. Eric, stay out of the basement. There is a darkness there, I can feel it. I think you heard too many ghost stories. I mean, we don't even have a basement. Yeah, babe, let's save the Voodoo talk for your superstitious girlfriends. Yeah, sorry. No worries. Have a good night. You too. I don't wanna come back here. Are you sure you don't want to come? There's so much to see here. It'll be fun. No thanks. I'm gonna read my book and pretend I'm back home. April, this is home now. Uh-huh. So what are we gonna do about her? There's not much we can do. You can pray for her soul. What? Hi. Who are you? I'm Lilath. I live around here, so I thought I'd say hi. Uh, hi. I'm April. Room for me? Um, uh, sure. I am so glad you moved in. It gets lonely here. Tell me about it. Well, no more being lonely. Hey, I'm gonna get us a surprise, okay? So hang here with mom, I'll be right back. - Oh. - Okay. Hey. Remember what you said in the car about praying? Uh-huh. You know we're not really the kind of family that does the whole God and religion thing, right? I know. That's part of the problem. What? If someone dies and their soul is broken, they don't get to go to heaven. They have to go to the dark place. Hey, sweetie, I don't know where you're hearing this stuff, but it's not true. Yes, it is. You know it is. There is no dark place. And when someone dies, and none of us have to worry about that for a very, very long time. But when they do, they just go to sleep. But sometimes they wake up. Surprise! Damn it, Eric! You scared me. I'm sorry, babe. This make up for it? Cotton candy! Yeah. Come on, there's a lot more to see. You should relax a little. I am relaxed. It's such a pretty day. You should feel the sun on your skin. - What are you... - Shhh. It's just us. Now... Doesn't that feel nice? Uh-huh. Uh. Uh, my folks are home. I should probably be going. I'll see you at school tomorrow. I don't go to school. - Uh. - See you around. Uh, yeah. Uh, definitely okay. Yeah. Rachel. Rachel. Rachel. Rachel, Rachel. Wake up. Bad things happen when you sleep. Eric, I need to talk to you. - Damn it, Vanessa. I told you don't come up on the job like this. - Hey, what's up? - I spoke to my grandmother about your house last night. Yeah. Eric, you need to be careful. Careful about what? She told me the history on your house. It is not good, Eric. What are you talking about? She said your house was built over a foundation of an old plantation home that burned down during the Civil War. Okay. Former slaves, they passed down stories about the terrible things that happened down in that basement to them. Unspeakable things. I mean, thank you for the history lesson, I just don't see how this affects me. The slaves revolted. They locked the family in the basement. And then they burned down the house. There are very evil forces at work in your home. You and your family are not safe. Sorry, I just... I think this is all a little ridiculous. Vanessa, go home. Alright. You're right. I'm leaving. I shouldn't have bothered you, Eric. Yeah, it's okay. Hey, sweetie. What are you up to? And you're my best friend. No one would ever be that. I hope so. That's not true. I just wanna be friends with you. Who are you talking to? No one. Do not take this thing out of the trash again. Go to bed. You shouldn't do that. Please don't be mad at her. She doesn't understand. But she will. I promise. - Mm, thank you. Love you. - Love you. Alright, let's go, kiddos. Breakfast was delicious, mom. Love you. Love you. Bye, sweetie. Sometimes they wake up. I'm being ridiculous. - Hey, honey. - Hey, babe. I'm... I'm sorry to bother you, I... I just keep hearing noises upstairs. Sounds like someone's walking around. A squirrel probably just found its way in. I'll take a look when I get home. Yeah, yeah. That's probably it. Um, alright, I'm sorry to bother you. I'll see you later. Love you. I'm losing my fucking mind. What the hell? You have to be kidding me. Damn it. Looks like you got a little car trouble. Yeah. I... I don't know what's going on and of course, I have an appointment I need to get to. Pop the hood. - Really? - Mm hmm. Oh, okay, great. Thank you. Give it a try. Thank you so much. Happy to help a neighbor. Glad to hear y'all moved in. Houses ain't meant to sit empty. Especially that one. Yeah. Uh, well, thank you again. I have an appointment I need to get to. Let me offer you a little neighborly advice. Don't listen to the niggers around here. They tell lots of lies. I... I... I have to go. Righto. I just feel so guilty. Guilty about what? Alice. Many parents who lose a child have feelings of guilt. That's normal. But it's not your fault that your daughter died. Actually, it is. Why do you feel that way? It was a Saturday. Eric had taken April and Andrew to the zoo that morning. Alice wasn't feeling well, so we stayed home. Go on. I was so sleepy that morning. I put Alice in her room and I went to lay down to take a nap. And I told Alice if she needed anything to come wake me up. What happened, Rachel? When I woke up, I went to check on Alice, but she wasn't in her room. I looked everywhere. And I couldn't find her. It's okay. Tell me what happened next. I ran into the back yard. And I saw her floating in our pool. She drowned while I was supposed to be watching her. You can't blame yourself. Who else is there to blame? Go. It'll do you guys good. - Sounds good. - God, Andrew will be safe with me. - Thank you. - Okay. - Mm hmm. - Yes. Have fun! We will. ♪ Let me sing you a lullaby ♪ Let me beg you to close those pretty eyes ♪ ♪ So you'll fall right fast asleep ♪ ♪ And have lovely sweet dreams of me ♪ Wow, you look nice. Nice? Not exactly the look I was going for. What I meant, I just... I meant like you look you know... I get it. So, do you have a boyfriend? Uh. Not really. Not really? I mean I had one back home. Did you guys ever do it? Do it? Like sex? Yes. Uh, uh no. Really? - Uh... - Have you ever been with a boy? Uh, no. Have you ever been with a girl? Uh. Of course not! Have you ever been curious? Uh, I mean, I don't know. Maybe, I guess. I just... When are mom and dad coming home? I don't know. They went to a late movie, so it'll be a while. I'm bored. Can you come read to me? No, I'm busy. Doing what? Uh. Just talking. You should come read to me. I said I'm busy. If you don't wanna come read to me, just say so. Oh my God. Sorry. He can be a little annoying sometimes. Let's go somewhere a little more private. My brother is not allowed upstairs. Your brother shouldn't bother us here. You are a beautiful girl. You really think so? I do. Oh my God. God has nothing to do with this. Kids are sleeping. I hope so. I'm gonna go check on 'em. Mm. Wait for you in bed. Stop it. Hello. You shouldn't be sleeping. Bad things happen when you sleep. Morning, sweetheart. Hey, baby. I was just calling to make sure you're feeling alright. I'm fine. Hmm. Hmm. I love you. Thank you. I'll get the kids, so we can eat. Okay. Andrew? Sweetie? What were you doing in the closet? Playing hide and seek. Well, that game only works when you have someone else to play with. I know. Okay, baby.

Our class needs three chaperones for the field trip. I was thinking you might wanna be one. Mom? What do you think? It might be fun? What might be fun? Nothing. Hey. Come back. Where are you going? Come back. We're not supposed to be out here. Help! Help! Help! - Got him. - Hey, you okay? What were you thinking? You should never go outside at night. Never! You know how dangerous the pool is! You could have drowned! - That's enough. - No, but he would have... He's heard enough, Rachel! You really scared us. Now you gotta promise you're never gonna do that again. Pinky? Alright, go get some sleep. Come here, come here. Hey. I... I haven't been so scared since... Hey, hey, it's alright. Alright? I know tonight was scary, but Andrew's fine. I'll put some childproof locks on all the doors. Right? Okay, come here, come here. Come here. I'm sorry I yelled at you. I think you made her angry. Who, baby? You know who. Things don't feel right in this house. Rachel... It doesn't feel safe. I know tonight scared you, but... I think I want the pool filled in. Do you know how much value that brings to the house? I don't care. I want it gone. Okay, okay. If it makes you feel better, I'll get somebody here as soon as I can. Alright? The sooner the better. Andrew, time for breakfast. Mom's been really off lately. She's just tired. That's all. I don't wanna go through what we went through before. Me neither, baby. Me neither. Your family hates you. That's not true. They want you to be all alone. Stop saying that! Your mother doesn't love you. Stop it! She is not a good mother. You should come live with us. I don't want to. But it's so nice down there. Andrew, time for breakfast. We'll be waiting for you. I have to go. It's your fault. You did this. You killed me. Excuse me a second, guys. Hey, honey. I'm in the middle of an important meeting. Eric, I need you to come home. Now. Okay what... what's wrong? I can't stay here. This place is... Hey, calm down. What's going on? I have something to show you. Something I can't explain. Okay, listen, I'll be home as soon as I can, alright. But I have to finish this up. Never mind! I know this is going to sound crazy, but I think I'm being haunted by Alice. You don't really believe that, do you? I keep seeing things and hearing things I can't explain. Scary things. These are just manifestations of grief. No, no, doctor, I... I have proof. Listen to this. That's not true. Stop saying that. I don't want to. Andrew, time for breakfast. I have to go. That sounds like a young man with a vivid imagination. No, I don't... I don't understand. I... I... I heard it. It was a little girl's voice. She was talking to my son. Sometimes our minds make up things that we want to hear. No, that's not what's happening. I... I don't wanna hear anything. What you're seeing and hearing is your subconscious trying to deal with your grief. But it all seemed so real. It's completely normal. Tell me, what have you and your family done to come to terms with your daughter's death? Nothing, really. We just pretend like it never happened. That's not healthy. Embrace that your daughter was a part of your life. Do you still have some of her things? Yeah, but they're all packed away. Create a special place where the family can remember Alice. Put some of her things there. Think of it as a memorial to her life. Okay. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for some medicine that will help alleviate any anxiety that you may be feeling. Okay, thank you. Can I come in? Yeah, but you have to be quiet. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. I don't want to play anymore. No, really, I'm serious. No, I don't want to play with them either. Just leave me alone. Gross. - Yeah. - I think it's delicious and then my other favorite. Do you guys like dairy-free things? - Yes. - Like, you know how there's like almond milk, oat... Look at me, mommy. Turn around and look at me. Um, may I help you? I'm Josephine Williams. Vanessa Williams' grandmother. We need to talk. I fear for your safety. Your family's safety. Mrs. Williams, what exactly are you talking about? Savannah has a history you can read about in the textbooks. But there's another history most folks ain't privy to. A dangerous, otherworldly history. Voodoo, magic, demons. Only a select few know the truth. I'm sorry, but why exactly are you telling me this. I heard stories about this piece of land when I was a little girl. I was told never to come here. You're starting to scare me. Good. You should be scared. Long before this house stood here, there was another house. A slave owning house. My great granddaddy worked the fields that used to grow outside. He and the other slaves heard rumors about what was under here. What are you talking about? You've seen things, haven't you? Dark things. I know you have. You fancy white folks like to pretend like it doesn't exist. But deep down, you know it does. There are many names for it. The abyss, gehenna, perdition, the pit. Most folks today call it, "hell". If you're trying to convert me to Christianity or whatever it is, you're wasting your time, because I'm not really the religious type. The fallen ones aren't meant for this world. Hell's walls are supposed to protect us from them. There are breaches in the walls of hell. One of them lies beneath this house. This is crazy. The fallen ones change people. Changed the family that used to live here. They got out before it consumed them. You know, I think I've heard enough of this nonsense. And it changed that first family that used to live here over a 150 years ago. The fallen ones drove them to commit unspeakable horrors against their slaves down in that basement. That white family thought it would appease them. Didn't work. Never does. My children are going to be home soon and I don't want you scaring them, so I need you to leave. They'll change you, too, unless you get out while you still can. Please go. Whatever you do, stay out of that basement. You've got to be kidding me. He's the only friend I've made here. You sound like a 14-year-old. Yeah, well, you're acting like one. The woman was offensive. I don't want her or her kind around my family. Her kind? Oh... oh my God, you know what I mean. I... I don't want my children exposed to all that weird voodoo shit. They're not welcome in my house. Oh, so now it's your house? Who the fuck is working every day to pay for it? So, what I do doesn't... Just grabbing something to drink. Y'all can go back to arguing now. Mommy, mommy. I'm sorry I said those things. I didn't mean it. I miss you. See I told you I could find the path. I've got a surprise for you. How much further? I'm not a woodsy kind of girl. We're almost there. What the hell. Isn't it sexy? No. Not at all. Why is there a cemetery in the woods in the back of my house? There used to be an old plantation near here. This is where they buried the family members and the slaves. How creepy. It makes me wet. Uh, it doesn't do that for me. Can we just get out of here? Come on, just give it a chance. At least, let me show you around. Alright. But we have to be quick. May I help you? Nice to see you again. Your husband asked me to stop by. Well, he won't be home until later. Oh, I ain't here to see him. He said somethin' about doing a little work upstairs. About a little girl's room? Oh yes! Yes, let me show you where it is. About the other day, I'm sorry how I left. I just needed to get to an appointment. Ain't a problem. We all got places we tryin' to get to. I mean, to be honest, I was a little shocked by the language you used. For African Americans. Oh, niggers. I didn't mean to offend you, that's just how I was raised. My daddy called 'em that and his daddy called 'em that. Well, just because your family used that kind of wile language doesn't give you an excuse to use it. The world has changed a lot since your grandfather's time. And for the better. You know what they say about the South. "The times may change. But the people don't." But if it makes you feel better, I'll refrain from using that word. Thank you. So, what do we do with this room? We'd like it to be something special. A place for our youngest daughter's things. Few sheets of drywall, a little paint. You'll have a pretty little girl's room in no time. That is the best news I've heard since... Well, since we moved here. I'll grab my tools, a few supplies, and uh, I'll get to it. I'm ready to go now. Not yet. I've always wanted to fuck in a cemetery. That makes one of us. It'll be hot. No. This is creepy. I just... Trust me. You're gonna like it. Get off of me. Are you out of your mind? I'm sorry. I thought you'd like it. Well, I don't.

I'm taking the children to the park this morning. Her soul is broken, mama. Andrew, I don't know where you're hearing these things. That's why she came back from the dark place. There is no dark place, sweetie. I'm scared. For all of us. There's nothing to be scared of. She didn't come back alone. Hi, Lilath. Um, I'm really sorry I freaked out the other day. I really miss you. Will you please call me back? Thanks. Whoa! Oh shit. Hi, Mr. Rancourt. I... I'm sorry. I didn't know anyone was out here. What exactly are you doing out here? With no clothes on? I was hoping to get wet. Who are you? I live close by. I'm Lilath. I've been watching you since you moved in. I've been waiting for you to be alone, so I can introduce myself. You shouldn't be in the pool with me like this. You don't like me being in the pool with you? This isn't right. You should leave. Mom, I really need to talk to you about something. I met a girl. And I like her. Mm hmm. What I mean is like I really like her. More than as a friend. And I don't really know what to do about it. I just... Oh my God! Mom! - Where is she? - Where is she? What were you thinking? Andrew, what were you thinking? You... you... What is wrong with you? Look at me! What were you thinking? - Look, you just... - You need to go. Okay, I can't believe... just go. You're no fun. Come back in the water. Really. You need to leave. Now. What a shame. I'm all wet. Please, just go. You need to leave. Are you really not going to fuck me? No, I'm not. I have a wife, I've a family. This is wrong. Please, please just go. Alright, Mr. Rancourt. I'll leave. I'd hate to do anything to mess up your precious family. Hello. Is she okay? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there. - Hey, I'm Rachel's husband, Eric Rancourt. - Mm hmm. What happened? Is she okay? Yes. Physically, she's fine. We called you, because we were concerned about her driving home. What happened? Your wife claimed she saw your son push a young girl into the lake. She dove in to save her. Mr. Rancourt, there were a dozen other witnesses out here. No one else saw this little girl. Is your wife taking any medications? No. Uh, she's just... She's just been under a lot of stress.

Leave my wife out of this. What do you want? Do you know what would be really hot? What? If you tied me up and fucked me in your basement. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! - I have to warn him. - Damn it, Vanessa! You can't keep coming on the job site like this. Vanessa, if this is about your grandmother, I'm really just not interested. It is not my grandmother. It is about me. I have been having visions about your house. Really, I don't care. I have seen some of the most disturbing images. Terrifying, sinister things. I'm just... I'm just not in the mood for your ghost stories. Eric, what's in your basement, it is not a dead human. It is not a ghost. It is something darker, something dangerous. I don't have a fucking basement. I don't have a goddamn basement! There's nothing evil about my house. Haven't you wondered why your house was never finished? Enough, Vanessa. Just go. What are you talking about? Don't you wanna know why the last owners left without finishing the house? No, this has gone too far. Vanessa, go home. Now. I'm sorry, man. Hello. Rachel? Dr. Livingston? I was calling to check on you. You missed our last appointment. Just making sure everything is okay. Everything is perfect. Really? That's great. We followed your advice. My husband decorated one of the bedrooms just like the one Alice had when she was alive. Well, that's not exactly what I advised. But I'm glad you're doing well. When can we reschedule your next appointment? I don't need any more appointments. I'm doing much, much better. But thank you for all your help. Rachel, I don't think that's... It's time. This way. Follow me, mommy. Almost, mommy. What are you doing? I thought I heard something. I wanted to make sure Andrew is alright. Why do you have a knife? Hmm? Oh, I... I don't know. I... Come on, come on let's go back to bed. Sorry, sport. We didn't mean to wake you up. So, April, SAT's are coming up. You start studying? Yeah, dad. What about you, buddy? School going okay? Yes, sir. Okay, we should probably get going. Bye. Bye, babe. May I speak with Dr. Livingston please? Hi Lilath. Uh, this is April. Um, things are really weird at home right now. And I need someone to talk to. Could you just meet me at the cemetery after school? Please. Have a seat, Mr. Rancourt. I'm really worried about Rachel. I think she might be dangerous. Dangerous? Rachel hasn't handled the death of your daughter very well, but I see no indication that she's dangerous. What did you say? Rachel hasn't coped very well with the death of Alice. Who the fuck is Alice? Rachel said your daughter, Alice, drowned in the pool at your last house. And that's why you moved to Savannah. I have to go. Hey, this is April, leave a message. April, I need you to call me back as soon as you get this, okay? It's important. James, hey, I need to speak with Vanessa. Uh, yeah, sure. Just a second. Vanessa, Eric wants to talk to you. Hello.
