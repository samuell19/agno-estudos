[Ambulance SIREN] [Ambulance SIREN continues] [Ambulance SIREN] - [Porter:] Get out of my way! Get out of my way! How are you feeling? Oh, don't touch me! Nice to meet you, too. Hello! - You're in a hospital. Yes, I can hear you. My head hurts. - I'm not surprised, you were hit by a cricket ball. [Porter GRUNTS repeatedly] Now, I am a doctor. I guessed that. I qualified as a doctor just three weeks ago. We're all going to die. Thank you, porter. - [Doctor:] So, I have a questionnaire. Name? - [Tom:] Um... well... Tom. - Tom, super. Right, who brought you here today? Um... - Parents? - No. They live abroad. - Friend? I don't really have any. Right, I'll just put "other". - [Headmaster:] Let me past. Get up, boy! It was only a ding, you can run it off. Sorry, headmaster. [Tom GROANS] Right, that ball must have been going extremely fast. It was actually one of my slower ones. - Conk. - Right, would you mind awfully just waiting in reception? - Yes, I would mind awfully. - You might want to peruse one of our posters on fungoids. Do you want a detention as well? [BLEEPING] Oh, no, more emergencies. "Newsagent has stapled his fingers to a Mint Aero." We'll have to finish this later. Porter! [Lift CHING - Porter PANTS] Um... Have you got a dream? Something you wish you could do before you die? I haven't really thought about it. - [Porter:] Um... Maybe you should. [Lift DINGS] Children's Ward. Good luck. [Porter GRUNTS continuously - Lift DINGS] Hi, I'm Tom. - We'll call you New Boy. I'm Amber. I'm in charge. Is that clear? Good. Robin, from the sound of your voice I'd say you were seven foot tall with an Afro. - Not exactly. - We both know I'm right. - I'm George and I'm the smart, and the handsome, and the clever one. - Who's that? - That's Sally, but you're not to disturb her. - She looks really ill. - Maybe you should mind your own business. Aren't there any toys or games? No, Matron doesn't believe in them. - This is worse than school. What a, dump. Look at the state of this place. It's absolutely filthy. I mean, whoever's in charge must really hate children. "Hate" is a strong word. I prefer to say detest. Children are just grown-ups who are too lazy to grow up. I mean, look at you all, just lying there. "Oh, I'm ill" oh, boo-hoo. You must be Tom. - Yes, Matron. - The world's worst cricketer! [She GUFFAWS] So where are your mummy and daddy? They work in the Middle East. Oh, they must have wanted to get a long way away from you. George's parents are away as well, aren't they, George? - Please don't. - They're in prison, for theft. So if anything goes missing on the ward, we'll know who to blame, won't we, George? - That ain't not fair! That's a double negative, George, like your mum and dad. Now, rules to my ward. No running, no laughing, boys and girls visit the toilet on alternate days except for Sundays, when it's reserved as a footbath. No talking after lights out, no crying. Everyone's in pain, you're nothing special. "This", is your bed. I think that's meant for babies. Well, I'm looking at one. Did you bring pyjamas? - Um... they brought me straight from the cricket pitch, so no. No problem... we'll just try the lost property box. [Flies BUZZ] Hmm... [She HUMS] - Ugh. - Ugh. - [Matron:] There you are. - [Tom:] Oh, it... I don't think they're quite my colour. Would you like to be operated on for no reason? - No. - All it takes is one phone call. They'll be fine. - Good, I don't want to have to report you to the head of the hospital. He's got no time for nasty little ungrateful brats like you. Sir Quentin Strillers, is an extremely busy man. [Classical MUSIC plays] [He HUMS] Line seven... [KNOCK at door] [He CLEARS his throat] Come in! Oh, hello, Sir Quentin. You asked to see me about something very urgent. - And your name is... Oh, Luppers. - And you are a... - A doctor. At this hospital? - Yes. - Splendid, well, as I'm sure you can appreciate, I am a very busy man. - You asked to see me. - Did I? - Yes, I was told there were some strange goings-on at the hospital. Ah, yes, Luppers. There's some strange goings-on going on, at this hospital. Unnatural goings on. Unnatural? Hospital equipment going missing, boof - back again. Patients out of their bed at the dead of night, strange noises from the cellar. - Oh, no. - Oh, yes. What are you doing tonight? - It's my night off, sir. I haven't had one since I started three weeks ago. Splendid, then you can investigate, have a delve, let me know what you find out. - Yes, sir. - Now, if you'll forgive me, I have got a hospital to run. Of course, sir. [Classical MUSIC plays] Beautiful... - You look like an ape at the zoo. - You smell like one, too. [They LAUGH] - [Matron:] Laughter is forbidden! You are here... to be ill. Now, it's very late. Gosh, it's almost six o'clock. Lights out! No talking. And if you have a medical emergency, do it quietly. Um, excuse me. Are you talking? Um... I'm just asking you a question. That is a subset of talking. I was wondering if my parents have been in touch. No. Perhaps they just don't care about you. Or maybe they've died. Or it could be a mixture of both. Sweet dreams. [Door SLAMS] [Song: Goodnight Children Everywhere by Vera Lynn] Sorry, Tom, you must be missing them. - Yeah.

[HOWLING tape OFF] He helps us. It's amazing what you can do with a little bit of imagination and the ice off some frozen fish finger packets. It was wonderful. This is so cool! I want to know everything. - If you tell anyone about The Midnight Gang, anyone at all, you'll end up in hospital. I am in hospital. Oh, yeah. Well, seeing as George has given the game away, you might as well know. The Midnight Gang has been making wishes come true in this hospital for near on 50 years. It doesn't matter if you want to be an ancient explorer... [Exotic DRUMMING] [Ghostly MOANS] Or if you want to be a ballroom dancer... [Ballroom dancing MUSIC plays] Or be a racing driver!

[Music: In The Mood by Glenn Miller] My turn's tomorrow. - George wants to fly! - [They LAUGH] - Why's that funny? - Come on, George. It's impossible. - [Porter:] Nothing's impossible for The Midnight Gang. Come on, you lot, back to your beds. I'm going to get my blowtorch and start to defrost. Thanks, Porter. That was amazing. Oh, it was my pleasure, young Miss. Anything to make you little 'uns happy. - [Lift DINGS] - Oh, this isn't our floor. Oh, we're busted. What are you kids doing up so late? [She COUGHS] We're not. You're imagining us. [Lift CHING] - Imagining us. Imagining us... [BANG] I ain't got no imagination. Out! So...? - Um... - Eh... we're top-secret dirt inspectors. You what?! [She COUGHS] Yes, we're checking you're cleaning the floors properly. - You've got an F, for "filthy". You can't even see nothing. - It's all done by smell. When did you last change that water? - Last Tuesday. Good for another week yet. [She COUGHS] Aren't you a bit young to be inspectors? - [Lift CHING] Children are best because we're closer to the ground. We can see dirt more easily. Goodbye. [She COUGHS] - [Matron:] Yummy, yummy chocolate... Shoes! [BANG] [He SIGHS] Where did you go this time, then? - Nowhere. - You can't have been nowhere. It must have been somewhere. Sally, go back to sleep. - You'll wake Matron. - Tom promised he'd tell me about the adventure. Well, I didn't exactly promise. You're a liar! I thought you were different. But you're just as bad as the others. - [PA system:] Dr Oliver, please come to reception. I ain't afraid of no ghost, I ain't afraid of no... I thought you were a doctor. Oh, yes. I... I am. - [WHISTLE] Did you know that there have been more goings on going on in the night? Freezer room, even stranger than before. What are you doing tonight? - Oh, you know, sleeping, crying. - Ah, splendid. No plans, then you can be on patrol again. And, Luppers, the truth, is out there. [Lift DINGS] - [Tootsie SINGS] La-la-la! La-la, la-la-la-la! Good morning and good morning and good morning, children. Rise and shine. - Good morning, Tootsie. - Ah! I see we have a new patient. - Hello. I'm Tom. - Good morning, Thomas, and what a good morning it is that the Lord has given us. Now what would you like for breakfast? - What have you got? - Everything! Everything? Everything. Whatever your heart desires. Oh, great. Can I please have waffles with cold vanilla ice cream and two jam doughnuts covered in chocolate and whipped cream? I've got toast or cornflakes. - Oh. - Cutbacks, I'm afraid, Thomas. - I see. - But it makes the patients happy to think they can have whatever their heart's desire. But they can't? They can, if they desire toast or cornflakes. - Toast, please. - I'm out of toast. Cornflakes? Yes, OK. [She HUMS] Now... I don't have any milk, so how about, a drop of cold tea? - Super. - Ah! Yes. Mm! Oh! Mm! Here. Sally, I've brought you an iced bun from the bakery. - Thank you, Tootsie, but I think I can only manage half. - I'll save it for later. - I'll have it, thanks. Good morning, Matron. - Out! - Oh, dear. Somebody hasn't had their morning coffee. I won't say it twice. You won't have to. [Tootsie HUMS] I know it was you lot causing havoc downstairs last night. I just had a call on the telephone. They found tiny footprints in the freezer room. - Oh, really? - You are all in big trouble! I'm calling Sir Quentin right away. It wasn't them. What do you know? - I couldn't sleep a wink last night, but everyone else was asleep the whole time. So it couldn't have been them. Swear it?! I swear on my hamster's life. - I'll be watching all of you very closely, and I am sending you and your pathetic little bump to the doctor. I'm sure he will discharge you immediately. Your headmaster wants you back at school. [Door SLAMS] [He SIGHS] Thanks for that one, Sally. - Hm, no problem. I..., I'm sorry you had to swear on your hamster's life. That's OK. I don't have a hamster. [They LAUGH] - [Doctor:] Tom, I have some very good news. Really? You are, 100% better. Do you know what this means? I've cured someone! Who would've thought? You can go back to school. - [Tom:] Oh! What?! Something the matter? I've just made some really good friends on the ward. Well, two words. "Pen pals". Or is it one word? Anyway, pop this in for a final temperature check, and I will let the Matron know that you are good to go. - [Tom:] Ah, wait! But..., but we never finished the questionnaire. Oh, yes. Good point. Yeah, hang on. Right. "Would you say that the music in the lift was too relaxing," "relaxing," "too exciting," "or made you feel, off your nut?" - I'm ill. - Well..., you look fine. Let's see. Oh, no. Oh, no! This is the highest temperature ever recorded in a human being. Am I well enough for school? No! No, no! We have to get you straight back to the ward as soon as possible. This is medical history in the making. Porter! Take it easy, Master Tom. See you all later. Tonight, I'm going to fly like an eagle. So, how are you going to make me fly? My idea is still undergoing refinement. Ha! I knew you didn't know. [Door OPENS] - [Matron:] Time to go for your treatment. Do I have to? - [Matron:] You're not here to have fun. This isn't Alton Towers. Come on, come on, come on! Hurry up. I know how you could do it. I really don't need any help, but if you insist, you may tell me. But I'm not a member of The Midnight Gang, so I can't. [Indistinct WHISPERING] You can have a temporary membership. On a junior basis. - [Tom:] So this is what we need to do. So we need to get all the... [Big Ben CHIMES] [Big Ben CHIMES] - [George:] Om, nom, nom! - [George:] Om, om! - [Matron:] You're at it again. That's it! I'm calling the Amputation Department.

Uh-huh, George! My favourite customer. - What are you doing here? - I had a third-degree stapling accident. Oh, they can be very nasty. Newsagent's job is the most dangerous job there is. I've lost many good colleagues to paper cuts. I like what you've done with the place. What do you desire? Chocolates, flowers, get-well cards? Prewritten cards are very good value, especially if your name is Auntie Deepta and you want to send a card to a Raj. We need, balloons. We want to make this sick boy's dream come true. Well, then, the cupboard on the right below the Panda Pops. You are welcome to them. By "welcome", do you mean you're not going to charge us for them? Ah, they are being used to let a young boy's dream come true. I want you to have them. - You're a good man. - [Raj LAUGHS] They're £12.50. [He BREATHES scared] How are you getting on, Doctor? I've found nothing at all. - There isn't a ghost. - I'm sure you're right. I remember that's what Dr Wilson thought. Who's Dr Wilson? The junior doctor before you. They found him on this very ward, with a hole at the side of his head, and by his lifeless body, an empty juice bottle. And a note. W-w-what...? - What did it say? - Yeah. It said, "Thank you for the brain smoothie." "Yum-yum." I need to go to the toilet as a matter of some urgency. That's got rid of him. Come. Right, I think we have enough. - Oh, my! What beautiful balloons. Are they meant for me? - Come on. That's Nelly. She's 99 years old and she has no family left alive. I've never seen such beautiful balloons in all of my life. Who sent them? Was it Daddy? She think she's a little girl. I do hope it was Daddy. I miss him ever so. I know how she feels. Oh! Yes, Nelly, your daddy wants you to have this. - Oh, it's beautiful. Did he say when he would pick me up? Soon. He said he'd come soon. Oh, goody! - Goodbye. - Bye-bye. Oh! - Right, give them over. I'm going to fly like an ostrich. - Ostriches don't fly. - This one does. - I'm not lifting. - We're one balloon short. Oh, it's almost as if "someone" decided to give one away! - There aren't any more. - Actually, there is one. Wait here. I suppose you're here to ask for my balloon? - How did you know? - How else are you going to get George to fly? - Thanks, Sally. - If I can't go on adventures, at least my balloon can. - Here we go. - Thank you! Wa-hey, I'm flying! - Whoa! Whoa! - Wahey! - OK. - Not yet. We have to be able to get you back to Earth. Someone has to go to the top of the stairs and catch him. It's a lot of stairs. Thanks for volunteering, Tom. [They LAUGH] Just so you know, Robin, I'm giving you a look. - Some people are born to witness history, some, to make it. One of us is about to become the first man, to fly. - [Tape PLAYS] - OK, I'm ready. Please, could I swap this one for a red one? - Oh! - My balloons! Give them back! - [Porter:] Oh, she's going too fast. - I'm guessing she might be a tiny bit lighter than George. - Tom, you're going to have to catch Nelly before she flies past! [SMASHING glass] - Help! - [Nelly:] Yippee! - [Porter:] Let's get after her. - [Nelly:] Oh..., Big Ben! Oh! [Tyres SCREECH] Oh, look at the lights. Can you see me? If you see the old girl, just shout. Right, let's go! - Yee-hah! - Hold on tight. - Yes! [Tyres SCREECH] [Ambulance SIREN] Straight ahead! - [Nelly:] Hello down there! Ooh! [Tyres SCREECH] - [Nelly:] Cooeee! [Classical MUSIC plays] [Tom SCREAMS] [Tyres SCREECH] - [Nelly:] Oh, it's so pretty. Oh! St Paul's! Oh, my goodness! Oh, I hope I'm not going to crash. Ooh! Oh, dear. Oh, I'm in the nuddy! - Well, I'm scarred for life. - [Nelly:] Whee! Oh! - [Porter:] Stop that naked pensioner! Oh! [Tyres SCREECH] [Ambulance HONKS] - [Nelly:] Oh! Oh, I say! Oh! Oh, look at all these pigeons. [Balloons EXPLODE] Oh, my goodness! - [Tom:] Oh, no! [Balloons EXPLODE] - [Nelly:] Whee! Oh, this is comfy. [Ambulance SIREN - Tyres SCREECH] [BANG] Oh! I think this is going to look... - [Nelly LAUGHS] Horrendous! If there's one thing I've learnt running a hospital for 30 years, other than you can charge what you like for car parking, it's that you don't leave naked patients dangling off statues. How's Nelly doing, sir? - Well, she wants to know when she can fly again. - Never! - She isn't even a member of The Midnight Gang! - Uh! - "Midnight" what? - Nothing. Drugging a member of staff, stealing another patient's property, damaging a valuable asbestos ceiling... Making me clean the hospital. Dilly, it is probably better if the hospital is kept clean. - [Tom:] It's all my fault. I was the ringleader. No, I was the ringleader. No, I was. I wasn't. Sir Quentin, it was me. I'm solely, to blame. I knew it! - Please, it's not true. - Porter! - Matron, send these children back to their ward. With pleasure, Sir Quentin. Now, you deceitful little beasts! - I find it unbelievable that you allowed the behaviour of the children to go on in this way! You are a responsible adult... Get out! - [Tootsie:] Good morning and good morning and good morning. I have everything for breakfast. Toast or cornflake. What is the matter with all you kiddie-winkies this morning? They are sitting in a damp puddle of their own guilt. They broke every rule in the hospital. - [Tootsie:] But they seem like such a nice bunch. No, don't be fooled. They even got the porter sacked. But the porter has been here longer than anyone can remember. I heard his mother abandoned him on the hospital steps as a baby. - [Matron:] Well, who can blame her? I mean, who'd want to look at a baby that frightful? Oh, the poor, poor man. I must try and find him. He deserves not an ounce of sympathy. He is as ugly on the inside as he is on the outside. Off! Tootsie... If you find the porter, can you tell him I'm so, so sorry. I will try. Well..., The Midnight Gang was good while it lasted. It can't end yet. There's still a member who hasn't had their wish come true. You. Although, can it be something really easy? It needs to be very unambitious. Like, have you always dreamt of lying in a hospital bed... staring at a blank wall? Actually..., I'd like to give my wish to someone else. Who? Sally. She wants to be in The Midnight Gang more than anyone, but we kept telling her she couldn't. We didn't want to make her more ill. But..., we should all have one dream come true, shouldn't we? Sally. Thank you for giving me your wish, Tom. What is it? We can't wait to find out. The thing is, I don't know if I'll ever get out of this hospital. My dream is to live a big, beautiful life. Oh, Sally! It's a lovely wish. Well, it's hardly unambitious, is it? Did you not hear that bit? So, faker, guess whose lab tests are back? Boy, I'm taking you straight back to school, and I hope you get carsick. - [Tom:] No, please, just one more night. Can't I say goodbye to my friends?! You don't have any friends. When we get back to school, I will personally ensure that your life becomes a waking nightmare. - [Tom:] How about I don't come back?

Well, I missed my home comforts. - [Lift DINGS] Go in there. - [Headmaster:] Boy? - He's not down there. - [Headmaster:] Boy! - You won't get away with this. Where are you, you wretched boy? Oh, look at all this junk. I've been in tidier riots. - That smell. It's very familiar. Let's go before I develop a skin disease. It looks like the possessions of a homeless man. I shall come back later and put them all in the incinerator. - Cruel and callous, a woman after my own heart. Do you hate animals too? Nearly as much as children. I can't bear children. - Literally or metaphorically? - Metaphorically. We shall have to see about literally. I open all the letters the boys receive, I steal the book tokens and then burn the rest. The local church sends my ward toys for the children. I sell the toys, and I spend all the money on shoes. Tom's parents have telephoned the school every single day since his accident. I just put the phone down on them. Would you like to join me this evening... for chocolate cake? Is it stolen cake? - Robin's parents sent it to me to share amongst the children. - [Headmaster:] Then it'll taste all the sweeter! [They LAUGH - Lift DINGS] - What a lovely couple! - I must invite them back. - Have you always lived down here? When I was a young 'un, the hospital tried all sorts of operations to make me look... presentable, but they didn't really work. When I was 16, my time was up. I had to leave. I didn't like it out there. Sometimes people think if you've got a stain on your outside, you know, you have a stain on the inside. I don't blame them. We're all scared of things we don't understand. But..., I found a job, and a place I could call home. And things looked up. It ain't fancy. But it meant I was on hand for The Midnight Gang. - Why do you always help them? - There's no reason. - There must be a reason. I don't know what you're on about. - Maybe you were the one who started it! - Me? - Yes! You were a patient here all those years ago, bored and with nothing to do. You're a right little Sherlock Holmes, you, aren't you? I am right, aren't I? Yes, Tom, you're right. I started The Midnight Gang. Just wanted to make the other kids on the ward happy. And that's what I want for Sally. I said I would make her wish come true, but it's impossible. - Hey..., nothing's impossible for The Midnight Gang. We've just got to work together. So let's sneak upstairs and get the rest of the gang. [Lift DINGS] - Uh-oh. - [Lift DINGS] Cleaners! Thank goodness. They unplugged my freezer, because the nice lady in bed four needed her life-support machine back on. But now the floor is covered in Solero juice. - The thing is, we're not real cleaners. - Sorry, Raj. Oh, in that case, can I interest you in some ice lollies on very special offer? [Ice lollies DRIP] - [Porter:] Maybe later. We are on a mission. [Lift CHING And 12 melted Twisters for the price of 11! - [Headmaster:] Mm. Scrumptious cake, Matron. - Where's Sally? - She got worse. They took her to the isolation ward. [Headmaster & Matron KNOCKING AND SHOUTING] That door won't keep them in for long. - [Headmaster:] Open the door right now! Here, have some chocolates to keep you going before help arrives! - [Headmaster:] Oh..., chocolates. - [Matron:] Oh, no! We shouldn't eat these! - [Headmaster:] Why not? They're so very, very tasty. [BANG] - That will see them through to the morning. What are we going to do about Sally? I've let her down so many times. Can't let her down again. You mustn't give in, hmm? She wants a big, beautiful life. The Midnight Gang is going to give it to her. Yeah. Robin..., stand up! [Alarm BEEPS] OK, ready? You go find Sally, hey? - [Sally:] You took your time. Are you sure you want to do this? It's now... or never. Sally, welcome at last to The Midnight Gang's presentation of... your big, beautiful, life.

Here, have a duster. - Pure genius. - It was mainly my idea. Do you know what the most moving part was? - Oh, um..., me being on the old projector here? - No. Seeing this special little patient of ours do something we've not seen her do before... smiling. Everyone here at the hospital works so hard to help young Suzy. - It's Sally. - Are you sure? - Fairly. - But none of us thought to simply make her smile. Sally... it's going to be a really long journey. But I want you to be able to do all those things for real one day. And I promise you, I will never stop trying. Thank you. - Sir Quentin... we couldn't have done any of this without the Porter. The kindest person I've ever met and... the man you sacked. - Well, I may have been hasty, but I'm sorry, you're not, getting your job back. - Oh. - No. I'm promoting you! What? Yes, our very first Doctor of Fun! Oh, thank you. - But I hear you live in a basement and we can't have that. Come and live with me and I will bring you breakfast every morning in bed. - Well, that's an offer. - Now, then, I think it's high time we left young Sally here to get some rest. - No, please, can I just have one more night back in the ward with The Midnight Gang? - I'm not sure that that... - Please! - Please, please, please, please. - All right. All right! All right! Just one night, mind. Yes! - Thank you. - Thank you so much for giving me your wish. You deserve it. What would yours be? Oh, I have two, and... one's come true. It was to make some friends. You big softie. What was the other one? To see Mum and Dad. Well, dreams can come true. The Midnight Gang's taught us that. It's been the most amazing night. I've had the adventure of a lifetime. - [Tootsie Sings:] La-la-la! Good morning and good morning and good morning! Breakfast time! Who wants cornflake box and water? So..., how's my favourite patient? - Better, thanks. - Good morning, Sir Quentin, can I interest you in a sock on some cardboard...? - [THUMPING and VOICES] - What's that noise? - Don't hear no noise. - How can you not hear it?! - [Matron:] Let us out! Let us out, now! Arrest that man! He locked us in there all night, have him put down! Is this true? I may have to reconsider my reconsideration. I hope this explains... [RECORDING:] "I open all the letters the boys receive," "I steal the book tokens and then burn the rest!" - "My local church gives my ward toys for the children," "I sell the toys and I spend all the money on shoes!" [Police SIREN] - I was doing those spoilt children a favour by stealing their presents! - My shoes, what will happen to my perfectly normal number of shoes? Don't be strangers! [They LAUGH and SHOUT] - Losers! - Losers! Tom, Sally had a chat with me yesterday, and I made some calls and, well, there's some people here to see you. Mum! Dad! So, what's on the menu for this breakfast in bed? Everything. And I mean, everything. [She LAUGHS] Oh, goodness! I've come to say goodbye. Bye, New Boy. All of us have to move on in the end. I'll have these casts off on Wednesday and then I'll be out of here too. I get my stitches out next week. And then I'll be gone. - My bandage is coming off at the end of the month. Then that'll be the last of us. Maybe this is the end of The Midnight Gang. Never. The gang just needs a new leader. Sally? - Me? - Yes. You will make sure all the new patients have their wishes come true. I would love to! But, will you help me? - You bet I will! - Just... don't get The Midnight Gang in any more trouble. Of course. Well, maybe little bit of trouble. - [Nelly:] Yippee! [All:] Nelly!
