I've got you now, ¿you give up? You haven't kissed me. Now it's your turn! Oh, it's glorious. Isn't Acapulco like Mallorca? Remember that night on the beach six months ago... ...when we fell asleep in the sand? I remember, the fleas. And that little boy who found us the next morning? How you wanted us to stay. What was his name? Papi? Speaking of the angel. Have a penny? Throw it to him, It's been wonderful being with you. You are my everything. I'm so happy you feel fine again. Oh, I couldn't have stood that boat another day. Those... ...engines pumping, it was like being under bombardment again. I know, is all my fault. I got us a cabin practically in the engine room. Your head hurts again? Let's take off our clothes and go for a swimm. - People would see. - There's nobody on that way. Another time, darling. I'm going home and right to bed. I've had it today. Packing on the boat, ...getting the luggage off, unpacking at the pension. You go on and make your head feel even better. I'll take you back. No, it's not late. The driver will take me back. I won't be long, just up to the point and back. A fine way to behave. Wake me when you get in, eh? Wanna be kissed goodnight? Fetch on Reidl. A beer. - You artist? - Yes. Just a sketch. You like to dance? - Will you join us? - Good evening. I was just telling my little guests of your arrival. This is Miss Everling, who teaches the manual boxing. And this is Miss Bradley, who teaches the singing... ...and Tico away. Correct? This is Mrs. Stevenson. - Hello. I instruct manual arts. Alice my friend, teaches music in Kiercut, Iowa. You came through the canal by freighter? How romantic! I've always dreamt of that. I'm afraid it wasn't very romantic. No banana boat. Most uncomfortable I'll never be able look another banana in the face. Mrs. Stevenson. You mean this enchanting young lady has a husband? Oh, Captain. This is Capitán Monteros. My bad boy from the police. And this is the bad boy's son, a good boy, Roberto. And Noonoo told me she's got new guests. But nothing about the beautiful lady. You see what I mean? He's incorregible with the ladies. I don't trust my Enrique. - Where is Sr. Stevenson? - Trevor's gone for a walk. I'm afraid he hasn't got his land legs yet. He hated the boat. It made him rather ill. I know exactly how he felt. I suffer horribly from mal-de-mer myself. But I would imagine you to be an excellent sailor. I'm ashamed to say that I am. - Maria, coffe for the señora. - Oh, no, please. I must ask you to excuse me, I'm exhausted. That's why I came back. - You arrived today, señora? - This morning. And I thought the day would never end, so if you don't mind. My dear, please. And if you need anything, just call for Maria. I must be off too, Noonoo. Have a bid day at police tomorrow. Come along, Roberto. My Henrique he never comes to see old aunt. But he comes five minutes and he's gone. And usually she used to ask me to watch Roberto. While he is.... Perhaps now that you have such enchanting guests. I shall come more often and stay longer. I'll see you all again, I know. Goodnight. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. You don't live here, Captain? No, I just keep bachelor quarters with my son. - You are married? - My wife is dead. Oh, I'm sorry. It was lonely at first, but I've grown acustomed to it. Can one? I don't know what I'll do without my husband. You've not been married long, Señora? - Six months. - Ah, then you're still in love. - Is that bad? - On the contrary. It's the nicest thing can happen to any of us. I know, I mean it out of love several times a week. You're something of a cynic, Captain. An occupational complaint, Señora. Roberto! Happy dreams, Señora. - Thank you. Here. I saved the piece of your favourite cake. For you. - Thank you, Maria. I should think of you when I eat it. With Roberto. It's time to go home, Señor. But, eh... Isn't there any other place? Have you ever been painted? You know... I'd like you to pose for me. Could you... ...tomorrow? I'll pay you well. Tonight. Sr. Stevenson is at home? Yes? The Captain, from the police. Just a moment. Yes, what is it? Capitan Monteros to see Sr. Stevenson. What does he want? Ask him to come in. Good morning, Captain. I was reluctant to call on you at such an early hour, ...but I did not even gone to bed early last night. It's quite alright. You want to see my husband? - Yes, Señora. I'm afraid that's impossible for the moment. - He's not here? - Yes, but he's not up yet. You see, my husband hasn't been well, he's been taking a drug to sleep, ...it'll be impossible to talk to him until, perhaps eleven? What did you want to see my husband about? To ask him some questions. Is it about our passport? If it's something like that, ...I'm sure our papers are all in order. About his whereabouts yesterday. His whereabouts, why? The girl was murdered. What is that got to do with my husband? He was seen talking to her. But he was with me all day yesterday. We went for a walk, we had an early dinner together, ...I came back here and met you. Remember? Your husband did not come back with you. He was seen talking to her during the evening. You understand, we must question everybody... ...who was seen with the girl last night. A number of people were. Unfortunately your husband among them. If you will tell him to come to the police station this morning. Of course. That is a formality. Don't let this gives you a wrong impression of us in Acapulco. These things happen anywhere. I understand. We'll be in your office before noon. Thank you, Señora. Just ask for me. There was a canteen and this girl was there. You know I'm a painter. - Yes. Well, I've been looking for a model, ...the moment I saw this girl I thought she was perfect. I asked her if she'd pose for me, she said she would. I made some sketches of her on the spot. Very rough. I arranged with her to come to the pension this afternoon, ...we fixed the price for her posing. And? I continued with my walk along the beach. I walked a long time. Several hours in fact until I was completely tired. Did you see anybody during this walk? I don't think so. It was very late by the time I came back to the town. Was I the only person who talked to this girl? I would like to talk to your husband alone. I have no secrets for my wife, Captain. The girl had rooms near the beach. Did you go out with her that way? I left her on the waterfront. May I see your passport? - Thank you. - You want mine? No, that won't be necessary. You're from Velmont, your home is there? It used to be. Ever since my uncle left me an income, I've been .. ...beach-combing. - Trevor. He sells pictures all the time. He's good. Don't listen to her, she's encouragable. Before we even met, she sold 3 of my paintings... in the art gallery where she worked... And she' never gotten over tit. You're from Velmont too, Señora? My wife is from San Francisco. And how long do you plan to stay with us? A week, a year, forever... It depends on how the work goes, so far it's been charming. We want our honeymoon to last forever. So you'll be with us for a little while? You mean you want us to stay? Oh, you'll understand, formalities in something like this. But of course, if you feel like leaving quickly, ...I would like you to let me know. Of course. I think that will be all. And thank you for coming in, ...and I hope your stay in Acapulco will be pleasant. Perhaps you'll join us for a drink one evening, Captain. We'll appreciate it. We hardly know anyone here yet. I should like that very much. Any evening I stop painting when the light goes. I should look forward to it. Goodbye. What is it what you say, Captain? Yes, very good, señor, very good. Pedro. I want you to wire to the police in Rodland, Velmont. Here's the name and the passport number. I want the complete coverage on Sr. Stevenson. I adore crimes of passion. When I was young, ...and men tried to kill me. - They really? - It is the truth. How did you escape? Judo? Well, I'm not sure what that judo means. Not judo, Gertrude. Did you talk him out of it? - Well... You may call it that. You are late, Señora. But lunch is still ready. Or have you eaten? I'm not hungry, thank you. The heat, you know. Oh, yes, it leaves no appetite. Señor, you have your appetite I hope. Oh, yes, of course. I'll be right down. Darling! Hey, what's the matter? I couldn't eat. That poor child with a horrible death. I know. Don't worry about it. I can't believe things like that going on while we're so happy. Don't worry! Just put out your mind and rest. I'll be up shortly. Hey! Hey... The glory of the beach-comber. - Where have you been? - Why Stella you've been swimming. I looked all the beach for you. I painted the rocks. it was beautiful. - Did you hear about the birds? - Birds, what birds? Señora Reidl. The cat killed two of them this afternoon. Ah, good riddance, now may be we'll be able to hear ourselves think. They woke me up this morning. Trevor, how callous. Why? What's callous about it? They couldn't be very happy anyway. How do you like to spend the rest of your life shut up in a cage? It's a dreadful thing. They are not dead. They do not sleep. They are awaken from the spring of life. You and your shelling. You've been painting marvelously. You had a good morning then, eh? Glorious. When I remember more. They have outsoared the shadow of our night. Envy and calumny and hate and pain. and that unrest which men miscall delight, can touch him not. And torture him not again. Fool, I love you. - I'm soaking. You'll get all wet. - Who cares? You're beautiful, and my love. My only love. Telegraph for you, Captain. Open it, please. Regard Trevor Stevenson, ...born Rodland, Velmont. Purple heart, medal of honor, Croix de Guerre. Pacient of St. Elizabeth Hospital for mental illness. Amnesia as result of battle shock. Discharged after eighteen months. Treatment sucessful. Well known painter. Evans, police chief, Rodland. Papa, what is amnesia? How is the homework coming? I can do it alone. What is amnesia? Yes? May I see you? It's important. Just a moment. Yes? El señor has lost something. Something of value. - Lost something? Some sketches. This one, señora. Where did you get this? They were found in her house. Would you give the reward? Reward? Why? They are valuable, no? Maria, my husband probably threw them away. I don't think so, Señora. He left them at the house. Herrera found them. And who is Herrera? This was his wife. If you like to come with me, I'll take you to him. Here, Señora. It's alright, Señora. In here. She's here, amigo. Forgive me I don't get up, Señora. Since my wife died. Show her the sketches, Maria. - They are yours? - Yeah, of my husband. You give the reward? - Why? - You understand, Señora. Since my wife died. I have no interest. I don't work. Nothing matters, I can't help it. I loved her. Yes. I don't want to make it bad for you, Señora. They call me amigo. I'm everybody's friend. But I need money. Six thousand pesos. For what? For... ...Reward. That's ridiculous. Your husband say he was not in the house with my wife. I was in Guadalajara when she died. I came back yesterday. I found this. I think your husband lies, Señora. I think you pay the 6.000 pesos. Why don't you tell the police? The police... She's dead now, Señora. A man must live. Perhaps I tell the police. My husband has nothing to do with your wife's death. I don't say your husband had, Señora. But the police? Won't they believe in it? You go get the money, Señora. You come back. Today? Stell! Yes? Only be a minute! Where've you been? Darling, what is it? What's the matter? Why did you lie to me? What? You were in that girl's house. The girl had a husband. He was away the night she was killed. But he came back, he found some of the sketches... ...of the girl you do in the house. You were in that girl's house, why didn't you just say so? I thought I'd hurt you. I was afraid of how it would look. What you might think. I met her at that canteen in the waterfront. She agreed to pose for me. Suddenly I felt like I could work. I went to her cottage, sketch for an hour or so. She gave me a drink. When I woke up she was gone and I came back here. But how could I tell that to anybody? Who would have believe me? I wasn't even sure you would. I believe you. I didn't know. I wouldn't hurt you for anything in the world. There's also a man. Made me phisically ill just to listen to him. What man? That girl's husband. He's trying to blackmail us. Darling, you've to go to the police right now and tell them everything. There is a law against blackmail. Where did you meet this man? In his house, Maria took me there. She knows everything. When I didn't tell the police I was thinking of you. I wonder... ...now if I tell them... They'll believe you when you tell them why. Or won't they? Maybe they won't. How did we have to get involved in this when everything was so perfect? When does he want the money? - Now, today. - How much? 6.000 pesos. Trevor, we have to pay him, haven't we? There will be no end of it if we do. if we do. I better just face it no matter what the police thinks of me. No! It's my fault really. If it hadn't been for me you would have told them. Nobody will believe you now. Still blackmail is a dirty business. I don't care, I love you, I won't let them do anything to you. The money is not important. I'll go to the bank right now and cash it in travel checks. The only important thing in the world, my darling, is you. I'm in luck. I was just on my way to call on you. Oh, what was it? Why didn't you tell me about your husband? What do you mean? I received this last night. I think you should've told me that your husband was in a... ...mental hospital. Or didn't you know? Of course I knew. Then, why didn't you tell me? I was in the war too, I have great sympathy for your husband. I had no reason to tell you. You're very loyal, Señora. I envy your husband and admire you. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? Send for a full report from the hospital. Why? My husband is not ill now. I've been living with him for months. There isn't a better adjusted person anywhere. It's only a method of routine, Señora. Believe me, I didn't mean to shock you. It will never be my wish to make you unhappy. Good day, Captain. An american, Sra. Stevenson, was just in here? - A moment ago, yes. - What did she want. To change some traveller checks. How large that amount? Five hundreds dollars, I think. Yes, five hundred. Trevor! Trevor! Trevor? Coming, Stell! Forgive me, Alice. But in "The corpse had two heads", ...how did detective Browsey break the case? Don't you remember? He turned the soprano up by her heels. from the chandelier in the opera house. Thank you, Maria. Of course. So much better than the bumbling fool in this. Don't we love one another. I'm your wife, there should be no secrets between us. Oh, Trevor, don't ever try to hide thingd from me or lie to me... ...or keeping me from knowing things. I should have told you before we were married. But I love you so much I was afraid you might not go through with it. Darling! Battle shock, they said. I blacked out. Come to some strange town, spent over a year in a hospital. Some kind of amnesia. There was a hospital right behind the line, ...where they evacuated an orphanage. For the largest time I couldn't get it out of my head... ...the sound of those bombs whistling down on those kids. But I'm alright now, what good would it have done to tell you? What'll be in the report they sent to the captain? I don't know. Why? Monteros looked so strange. But I have nothing to do with this girl's death. I just talked to her. And she was murdered and he knows you've been in a hospital. If we could only leave. - We can't, there's no way. The buses, the airlines, they'll be sure to find out and stop us. Anyway, I have nothing to do with this girl's death. I don't know how they do things here, anything could happen. Look! Fishing boat. We could go fishing. Everybody does it here, It's one of the tourist industries. We're a thousand miles from the border. A fishing boat can get us to easter bay. From there a plane to Vera Cruz, and on to Brownsville, Texas... ...we can walk across the border, no passports, no anything. If we get away by tomorrow morning, we could be in East Peck by tomorrow evening. What about our things? Leave them closed, luggage, everything. Trevor, I wanna get out of here. I'm afraid. - Oh, darling... - Please. I'll drive down to the dock right now and find some fisherman... ...and tell him we've got to get to East Peck by tomorrow, I'll pay him anything. Still I don't think we should. Herrera, the husband. We've got to stall him til we get away. Maria! Tell your friend I couldn't get the money today, ...It'll have to be tomorrow, I'll have to wire for it. I'll see you upstairs, darling, I won't be long. Over there, Señora. Thanks you. Wait for me, eh? Good afternoon. I was hoping to find someone who spoke english. Oh, I speak a good english. Excellent. You take out fishing parties? All the best waters I know. Gomez fishing parties, are famous. Come on, come on. It's a lovely boat. I guarantee safety boat. She go everywhere. Could she go to Mazatlan and back? Mazatlan? Too far. Two days to go, two days to come. But my husband wants big fish. But there is big fish in here. I guarantee you'll catch plenty fish. But it is also a party. Fun. We'd like to stay out overnight. Ah, sí. Understood. You want overnight. You and gentlemen. No, you don't understand. He's my husband. Your husband. But Maria Cristina, my wife, if I don't come home, she get mad. Four days is too much. What about East Peck, closer? East Peck better. One day to go, ...one day to come back. Are there any good hotels in East Peck to stay ashore. Sure, nice hotel. You and husband, like it. Excellent. We leave early tomorrow morning, Stay in East Peck tomorrow evening come home the next day, ...you see Maria Cristina. - At what time we leave? Seven, six? Seven. - Seven. - How much? Two days... One thousand pesos? Good. Done? - Done. No, no, no, no. You pay now. In advance. I give receive. What is the name? Mrs. Trevor Stevenson. - Mrs. what? - Trevor... ...Stevenson. - Mrs. Trevor... Mrs. Trevor... Ready. I hate lies. You think Senora Reidl will believe this? I'll go first get a cab. When I've got one I'll signal from the gate. ...watch through the window. Alright, Stell. I see you love the early mornings too. How is Sr. Stevenson today? Not very well, the migraine still? Yes. - He's in bed? - Yes. Oh, that's too bad. You have the morning to yourself? My car is here. We could take a drive to morning beach, ...there's a magnificent view from there. Some other time perhaps, thank you. It's such a lovely day, no? No. C'est la vie. Oh, I almost forgot. As long as Sr. Stevenson is ill I dare say you won't be up... ...to travel to East Peck today. I took the liberty of picking up your passage money. I thought you were going to tell me when you plan to leave town. We wanted to go fishing, it was a sudden decision. The police asked you to stay. We do not like to be told what we can do and what we can not do. This is like living in a prison. - Oh, I know. And yet isn't all life prison in some way? And there is no escape from it. Not even the fishermen boat to East Peck. Please, don't forget to tear up the receive. Oh, Trevor... How did he find out, that Gestapo? Oh, darling. I'll show him, we get out of here somehow, ...I'll find a way, I promise you that. Darling, is not that important. It is. I want you well again. I want us as free to do as we please. I have to pay Herrera today. No, darling, I don't want you to see that man again. But you tell the Captain, don't you see darling, we need time. Alright, give me the money, I'll handle it. One, two, three... Six thousand pesos. Hello? Where is Herrera? I brought the money here and I want the things. Certanly, señor. I'll take your things. Here, señor. They are good drawings. But maybe a little expensive, no señor? Yes. Goodbye. You must seal the deal. Our custom. Compliment, señor. I wrong. Herrera say you give him the money. I do not think you do. You have much money, señor? Herrera never have money. He gamble, cockfight, ...get drunk, ...women, he knows. Money has no sense about. This he will spend real fast. I'd like to have money of my own. You do not know, señor. You're rich. But life is hard for a woman. A woman needs help. It is difficult to live. You draw her, señor. May be draw me too. I'll make a good model. I work for an artist once. She liked me, she teach me manyy poses. She say I'm the best he ever had. I think you would like me. Do not be afraid, Senor. It is only Manola. His old truck has no brakes. It will not disturb, amigo. We try, señor? You see if you like me. You know you have all your pictures? Try one. Birthday present. My mother in law just have them sent from La Havana. What a Chief of police. How can you take their attempt to leave town lightly? I think he's guilty. Stevenson? Ah, I told you to let them go. They will only be bothersome around here. I talked to doctor Cortes. He saw Stevenson on the first day he got here. He was sick alright. A combination of claustrophobia, ...and sea sickness. Perhaps a recurrence of his wartime mental condition. Tourists! Always something wrong. If there isn't their stomachs, it's a... But why pick on the american? Look what we get. Anybody could have murdered that girl. She was a kind of girl who invites being murdered. Probably was a fisherman or a drunken sailor. Anyway, What's her wife like? I guess she's most attractive. She is. And devoted to her husband. She hasn't sucumbed to your fascination? Why don't you talk to Stevenson? Bring me more evidences than your interest in Sra. Stevenson? And I will. I can never get near him. His wife always sees me alone. I know she wasn't impervious to your charm. Go on. Question the lady again. Who knows what may happen. How's my godson in these days? Growing more everyday? You ought to marry again. Give the boy a mother. It's what all the ladies say. Well, thanks for the cigar if not the marital advice. My pleasure. Good luck. Open the door. It is Manuel. He's drunk. It's true. he drink. It's his curse. Chiclet. Chiclet. Chiclet. Trevor? Oh, it's you. I figure I miss your husband again. He's out. You're expecting him, obviously. Not exactly. You mind if I wait? You aunt may appreciate your company more than I would. And you can watch both doors from down there. And Noonoo is a delightful woman. And in her youth has broken many hearts. But time, tequila and destiny have had their way. I prefer to wait with you. I've always heard that latin men were very gallant, Captain. It is not a virtue I specially appreciate. A national caracteristic, señora. If I offend, I'm sorry. But surely as a traveller, you believe in the old doctrine? When in Rome, do as the Romans do. You're very sure of yourself always, aren't you? Should not be? Captain... I don't know what your life is been like, ...my husband and I have known each other for over a year now. The only time in my life I've ever been happy. My parents died when I was a child. I never knew what happiness was until I met Trevor. I am passionately determined to keep my happiness. There was never a shadow until we met you and you kept us here. I do not think this is fair, señora. The circumstances of the crime but not my doing. We only stopped here because my husband wasn't well. We were on our way home, we'd like to continue that journey. But I realized after this morning. Your gallantery, captain, maybe a national caracteristic, ...or maybe a personal one. In the latter event, I assure you I don't like it. Señora... I've noticed you looking at me in a certain way every time we meet, ...I don't like that either. And if that is the reason behind your continually watching us, your... Persecution on us. I can not tell you how much I loath and despise you. You maybe your aunt Noonoo's naughty nephew captain. You are not mine. Señora, I have a job to do. I'm doing it. Are you? You know as well as I do my husband has nothing to do with the death of that girl, ...and your keeping us here is an entirely a personal matter. Here is my husband. Whatever you want to say, say. Whatever you want to ask, ask, ...I think it's time we have this all thing over and done with. What is this? I've just been telling the captain we want to be clear and get out of this town. We have nothing to hide, captain, ...in fact I think there's something we should tell you that you don't know. What did you say to her? What have you been telling my wife? We don't want you here, get out. Trevor, wait. To protect me my husband lied to you. It's the only secret we have, captain, and I don't want any secrets on this. - Stella... - Trevor, we must tell him. We can not go on living in this twilight of truth and deception. You know that, don't you. Please, let me tell him... - No Stella, you won't. Señor! Keep your filthy hands off of me! Señor! - What's going on, Alice? - I think someone is being killed. Trevor! Trevor! What a goddam help! Trevor. Gertrude. Come back here. Don't go near those ruffians. He's unconcious. What happened? What are you going to do? What you want me to do? I'm so sorry. Is he ever been like this before? No. I don't know. He's the kindest of man so I like him. This, war illness... Sometimes this things come back. What was this you were going to tell me upstairs? It was unimportant I thought. What was unimportant? Let me talk to him. I'll bring him to your office in the morning, first thing, ...I promise. - Capitán Monteros! Excuse me. Yes? Another urgent call for you, Captain. Homicide. - Get my hat, it's upstairs. - Yes, sir. If you need me... Thank you. What is it? Herrera's just been found with a murdered girl, captain. Captain. Where's the body? You sent for the doctor? The coroner? They are on their way. Who was in the house when the body was found? These three men. You, come over here! What you know about this? - Oh, well... - You killed her? - No, no, no. - Was your friend here? No, no, no. We come in the house and found him here. Making ********* of her. Crying. - Sí, she's dead then. He was drunk. What you know about this, Herrera? I didn't kill her, I didn't do it. I swear, believe me, I didn't kill her. I wouldn't kill her. I loved her. You loved her? So you killed your wife to be with her. No... No, no, no! No. He says he loved this woman. You think he murdered his wife? He was out of town the night his wife was killed. He is a prize-fighter. He had a match in Guadalajara. He didn't get back until the next day. Check again, maybe somebody was covering for him. I checked it, double checked his alibi holds up. Both women were strangled the same way. These prize fighters. You never know. What are you thinking? No evidence. No evidence against Stevenson. - Stevenson? We have evidence against Herrera. This afternoon he was found with the body of his girlfriend. Look... Wherever we turn, we come upon one figure, the american. He was seen with the first girl, ...the second girl is the maid where he lives. Several years ago he was in a mental hospital. No evidence and you know it. As far as I'm concerned, the american has nothing to do with the case. In fact, you've been telling them they can leave any time they want. You care if you want to, I want to hold Stevenson. If you want to hold Stevenson, bring me some legitimate evidence, ...not tinted with your personal feelings. Good morning, señora. Good morning. You are the Captain's son, aren't you, Roberto? Yes, señora, I saw from way down there. You did? And you run all this way just to say good morning? No, señora. To see if you are alright. Of course I am. What made you think I wasn't? My father. Your father? He did his job, I guess. But love makes he can not sleep. She says it is because he worries about you. How very considerated. You must not be afraid of anything, señora. Not when my father looks after you. And then what we will do .. We take good care of you. I'm sure you will. Thank you, Roberto. Si, señora. Forgive me, Mrs. Stevenson. My nerves have been so on edge since I heard the horrible news. Makes your blood run frigid, doesn't it? What news? You don't? I just slipped down the street for food Gertrude and I heard it. Poor Maria. Imagine a monster killing two girls. The bluebeard. Maria? Something's happened to her? She's dead. Strangled! Finger marks all over her throat. What's that man's name the husband of the girl found in the bay? Herrera! He did it. He carried with the body yesterday afternoon. The police are holding him now. We girls needn't fear any longer. Of course, he killed his wife too, both methods precisely the same. Crimes of passion. Gerprude, gerprude. You've been fascinating. Trevor. Trevor. Our father, ...who art in heaven, ...hallowed by thy name, ...thy kingdome come, ...thy will be done... - Who is it? - Sra. Stevenson? Just a moment, please. Sra. Stevenson, the chief of police asks me to tell you: You and your husband have the liberty to leave the city whenever you wish. He's sorry you have been troubled. The case in which the señor was a witness has been settled. - Settled? - There has been a new murder. And the man amigo Herrera is now being charged with both crimes. The chief wanted you to know as soon as possible. - Thank you. - Good day, señora. What's the matter, darling? Wonderful news. We can go. We can leave, we don't have to stay here any longer. We don't? The chief of police sent word just now. We can be home tomorrow, Trevor. Tomorrow. - Home! Then, why are you crying, darling? Who came to tell you, Monteros? Just a policeman. What are you looking for? What's the matter, darling? I had a bad dream, a nightmare. About yesterday. Only I can't quite remember. What kind of nightmare? That girl, the maid. She was in it. Maria. I went to their house. Those sketches. Yes, Trevor, I have them, I put them in the bag. My head, it hurts. I can't think. - Don't, darling, it's not important. Is just that I can't remember. Don't try to think, we'll be home tomorrow, ...we'll go to the hospital, you can see your own doctor. Those black periods of nothing... Stella. If I were sick you wouldn't leave me, would you? I mean it's not bad, it'll go away. You're wonderful, Stell. I do remember something. I hit you last night. - No, darling... - Yes, yes, I hit you, I did, I remember that. Trevor, look at me. You didn't hit me, do you understand? Don't hate me. Hate you? How can I ever hate you? I told you so many times, Stell you are all I've got. If I lost you, I... - Don't... Remember our honeymoon? The wishing well? We threw gold coins into it and promised we'd never be separated. We were pretty wonderful when we're still. There wasn't anything wrong anywhere in the world. There was a small world, just Stella and Trevor. Just two people. And then the other serpent came into Eden then. And drove us out out of paradise. Stell, you are all I got. You're all I've ever known of paradise. All I hope to find in heaven. If the shadow close in you gotta be here to give me light. I know that. What about your wife? There was nothing between us anymore. I know what she was like, but I didn't kill her. But when she was dead, I was glad. But Maria... Maria was my whole life. Both women are killed. Strangled the same way. Thumb pressure was brought to bear here. I didn't kill anyone. How much did you make on your last fight the night your wife was killed? How much did you have paid? Eight hundred pesos. You've saved your money? I have no money, sir. You can get nothing of me. María, did she have any money? How did she get this? Six thousand pesos. - Six thousand pesos. - It was found on her body. Then she came at last. She was there! - Who was there? - The american señora. - Sra. Stevenson? - That's it. She was coming. - Why? On bussiness. What kind of bussiness could she have with you? About her husband. What about him? When I came home from Guadalajara, ...after my wife is killed, ...I found some things of the señor in my house. I knew he was there with my wife. No matter what he says. - Why didn't you tell me that before? - I told Maria. She said we can have money. The señor doesn't want the police to know. She get the señora to come to my place or... ...I'd bring the things to the police. So they will know the american lied about not being in the house. That's blackmail! What about the señora? She was to bring the money yesterday, ...six thousand pesos. - What are those things? - Pictures of my wife of... ...the señor. He drew them. Where were they kept? There's a cabinet in the house. They didn't find anything like that. No, captain. We searched every corner of the house. We'll go back. Come along. I wanted to tell you yesterday. Yes, Trevor did go to the girl's house. He was afraid if he told you about it I might misunderstand. That is not true, señora. The sketches are no longer in the house, ...someone took them. Someone give Maria six thousand pesos Three days ago, señora, you took six thousand pesos from the bank. I don't want to talk to you. The chief of police said we can go now. My husband is ill, very ill, I don't want him upset. Whoever left the money murdered Maria... You haven't any proof of anything. A man is in jail now, accused of those crimes, ...an innocent man, what of him? There's at least a week before his trial, isn't there? Yes. Then I have time. Please, forgive me, captain, I have many things to attend to. - What are you trying to do? - Goodbye, captain. I'm thinking of you, señora. What about the future? What kind of nightmare will you have from this day on? Your love is not enough to protect you. What makes you think I want protection? You believe your husband is innocent? Innocent? Only children are innocent. I know my husband to be good. Goodbye, captain. I am sorry, señor, but we have so much trouble doing your stay here. I hope you'll have a pleasant flight. Thank you. There ain't nobody to help you with your bags. Poor Maria... I call the Express Company coming this morning, they said they would pick up our bags by this evening. You have our address if there's any aditional charge or anything. A good trip, señora. Perhaps one day we'll see you again. - Perhaps. Goodbye. - Goodbye. If you believe Herreras told about blackmail, sketches and so for. We could question the americans a little longer. She never told us she was there, ...he never told us he was in the house. Where are they now? On their way to the airport. You told them they could leave. Alright. Alright! Bring them in, but remember Henrique, diplomaticaly. Understand? Go on, go on! - To the airport. - Yes, sir. What is it? The noise. Your head's bothering you? It'll be alright, I'll take a sleeping pill on the plane. You go inside, I'll get the luggage through. Maybe we could make this trip tomorrow. No, Trevor, we gotta get out of here and get home. You'll be alright when we'll be on our way. You go inside I'll get the luggage through. It'll onle take a few minutes. Trevor! Darling. Sweet heart. Is the pain so bad? Go away, Stella. - Go and leave me alone! - Leave you, how can I leave you? Trevor, listen to me. We've got to fight this. It's our only chance. - Go away, Stell! Trevor, dearest... Look... It was this way before each time I got sick. I could remember. It's happening again! - Don't believe it. It's been happening since we came here. I didn't know! I don't believe it. Go away, Stella! I'm alright. Of course you are. There are children here! Children and wounded. Stella, Stella! It's a hospital! Hospital! - Check the hangar! - Yes, sir. Come, Pedro! Sister, sister! Help, sister. They are calling me there. The children! He's one of monsters, he must have crashed. Where's my gun? Where is my gun? Capitán Monteros! Let me go, sister, I'll get him. Trevor! Don't shoot! Run for an ambulance! Darling... Darling... What's the matter, Stella? There was an accident, darling. Oh? I feel so tired. Dying... Where are you, Stella? Right here, very close. Hold my hand. Don't leave me. I... I've .. Trevor? Trevor!
