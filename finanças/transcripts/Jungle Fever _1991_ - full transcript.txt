Right there, right there. Oh, God, oh. Don't wake the baby! Don't wake the baby! Don't wake the baby! You know you probably woke up Ming again. Why do you always say that to me? Because you always wake her up. I'm not the vocal one, Flipper. You are. I can't believe you said that. Every day we go through the same thing. You make too much noise. I love it, but you do. I was very quiet. Ming? Ming! Come on, Ming-a-ling-a-ling, you'll be late for school. Wake up. Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up! I know you're faking. I can see your eyes moving. Last chance. One, two... Three. That's it! Wake up! Wake up, wake up, wake up! - Daddy, why did you do that? - Because you were faking, that's why, and you're gonna be late. - Good morning. How are you? - Fine. - How did you sleep? - Fine. Good, OK. Put your slippers on. You go to the bathroom, brush your teeth and wash your face. Mommy'll be here to do your hair, and this is what you're gonna wear. See you later. High five. - Psych. - That's not fair. - Morning. - Morning. Good morning, baby. Watch your hand. Daddy, why do you always hurt Mommy? Eat your oatmeal. Mommy's always screaming like you're hurting her. Eat your oatmeal, baby. Honey, you know what? Remember how we go to school and feed the pigeons and squirrels? Yes. Remember the sparrow was biting that other sparrow on the booty? I remember. - And squirrels biting each other? - I think so. - I said it was a spring thing. - I remember. Mating season. Well, baby, that's what your mom and dad are doing. We're making love. I know, I was testing you if you'd tell me the truth. You knew. You little smarty. You are too smart for your age. - Mommy and Daddy... - Eat your oatmeal. Are you just doing it or are you trying to make a baby? - Eat your oatmeal. - I'd like a baby brother. - So, you feel full? - Yeah, that oatmeal's filling. Yeah. How do you like it? Hmm. I'm kinda tired of oatmeal. - I'm tired of oatmeal myself. - You never eat your oatmeal. Cos I'm tired of it. We should have Mommy fix something different. - We should tell her tomorrow. - All right. You think that I don't know that you be awake? That you have your door open every morning, listening? You're trying to jive me. I know what's going on. You know that? - Nothing gets past you. - Nothing gets past me. OK, here. I love you so much, mmm! - Have a nice day, OK? - OK. Tell Mrs Jones I said hello. - OK. Bye. - Bye, baby. ♪ This is fun day on a fine day ♪ When the air is filled with tweeting birds ♪ That sing together in the sun ♪ This is your day ♪ Yours and my day... ♪ - Could you wait here? - Sure. Hey, Flip. - Good tie, nice ensemble. Sharp. - Thank you, Jerry. Leslie, Tony's work here is awful. He's got this elevator shaft six inches off. - We caught that. - Whew! Listen, we have somebody we want you to meet. She comes highly recommended. This is Angela Tucci. She's replacing Terri. Hi. - What? - She'll be replacing Terri. - Glad to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. I look forward to working with you. We explained to the temp service how diligent Terri was. - Said give us the best. - And here she is. Listen, call me Angie. I don't like Angela. - Angie it is. - OK. You don't have a problem, do you, Flip? No, no. - All right. - She's all yours. - Bye. - Uh... - It went pretty well. - Of course. - So, your name is Angela Tucci? - Yeah. - You're Italian? - Yeah. What else would I be? And you don't like to be called Angela. Angie's fine, you know? Flip is a nice name. If you don't mind my asking, what kind of a name is that? My father. If you don't mind ME asking, how long have you been temping? Since high school. Have you ever worked in an architectural firm? No, but I learn really quick. I... like to learn new things, be around new people. - I like people. - You like people? I love people. Uh-huh. - Excuse me just a minute, OK? - OK. - C'mon, guys, what is this? - Oh... someone needs a chill pill. I thought I asked for an African-American to replace Terri. - An Afro-American? - African-American. You know I did. I put it in writing. I didn't see it. You see it? You send her back. Tell her you didn't like her performance because she's white. What? That's not the point. Flipper, give her a chance. This sounds dangerously like reverse discrimination. What?! Leslie, this is not reverse discrimination. Why is it that I'm the only person of color in this office? Is that discrimination? Why hire someone solely because they're an African-American? That's not fair. We hire who we feel is the best human being for the job. Fine, fine. Miss Angela Tucci it is. But I just want you to know, I hope this works out. Since she likes people. Angie's home. Dinnertime. All right, now to the graveyard. - Put 'em in the graveyard. - What time is it? - The train broke down. - We're hungry. Starving. - How was your day? - It was good. New job. Fancy place. I'm glad they got rid of Strawberry. He was too much trouble. If he wants his ass kissed, let him go to LA. Now he's a born-again Christian. Fuck born-again! - Play the fucking game! - We're starving, Ange. - You grown men crippled? - God forbid. - Do your arms and fingers work? - Don't be mean. We're hungry. - We'll help. - Help lift your fork to your mouth? - Good, huh? - It's good. No, that's plenty. I'm eating like a fucking pig. Dad, are we gonna cuss at the dinner table? Sorry. Sorry, sweetheart. Sorry. I'm still eating like a pig. You guys, you should thank your sister. - For what? - She works hard all day. - Oh, we don't work now! - She rushes home. She cooks like your mother, may she rest in peace. - I like Mommy's cooking better. - So why don't you cook? Jimmy, why don't you cook this week? - Jimmy's cooking this week! - What's the matter with you? - What's the matter with you? - Didn't you hear me? - Yeah. - You heard me? Did you understand what I meant? I just said it. I was thinking that and I just said it. She broke her ass. Made a dinner fit for kings. And "I like Mommy's cooking better." Is that nice? I want you to apologize to your sister. - Do what I tell ya. - Fucking apologize. Don't kick me. I'll put this glass in your face. - You apologize! - Shut up! Shut up for 10 minutes! No one cooked like my mother. - What a fucking life! - Just eat. Angie, come on in here. Sit down and eat. - You got no class. - It's not a world affair. That's it. Forget it. I'm done. - Just smack him in the head. - Come and sit down, Angela! Please, Ange. - Flip. - What's up, Cyrus? - You got any gum? - Gum, gum, gum, gum. Yeah. - Doublemint. - What's up, man? Doing my 25 miles... Daily. - What's up with you? - Hey, brother. I'm a natural black man trying to survive in a cruel and harsh white corporate America. - I don't know how you do it. - I don't know how you do IT! Hey, Cody. How you doing? What's up there, boy? - How you feeling, man? - Fine, Vera. How are you? - What's Drew up to? - Getting ready to cook. - Tell her to call me. - All right. - See ya. - Come on, Cody... Whew. Ohh... - Vera, how you doing? - Hi, honey. What are you staring at? Those birth control pills enlarging your breasts. Yeah, did you pick up that prescription? - I forgot. I'm sorry. I forgot. - You weren't supposed to forget. - When are we having kids? - I just got promoted! It's not an easy job to get. Plus, you promised you'd go back to school - before we had some kids. - That I did. You make all their money. Their whole Japanese account is because of me. They'd be crazy not to do this. - Baby? - What? I want you to be prepared, though. Prepared for what? Prepared for if they... they say no. - If they say no? - Look... No, no, no, no, they're not going to say no. - They have no right to say no. - Totally crazy. I've done everything. Most of the money they make is because of me. Totally! I deserve this. They're not going to say no. Don't think about it. - No negative thoughts? Right? - That's right. - Positive thoughts. - Positive. I'm so positive. What do you want, scumbag? Charlie. I'd like to see your sister. Angie's not home, Paulie. Come on, don't try to be slick. You know and I know that she's washing dishes. I want to see Angie now. Come on. - Angie! - What? It's for you. - Hi, Paulie. - Coming out? Yeah, I ain't washing the dishes tonight. - Charlie's washing, Jimmy's drying. - That's a change of pace. Let me go. - Yo, Jimmy? - What? Prince Charming's here. Check it out. Whoa... Paulie! Paulie Carbone, my man. - What's up? - Hey, Jim. - How you doing? - Good. Look, Paulie, we were wanting to know if you were fucking our sister. You fucking my sister, Angie? What kind of question is that? That's a good question. It's a stupid question and I ain't answering it. Paulie, if you are you better not be cos you'll get a fucking beating. If we ever hear she's not a virgin, your ass is grass. You'll wish your mother never had you. - You ever get her pregnant... - Hey! I don't know why I'm thinking this, but if you did... I'll give you the abortion, then you're gonna marry her, OK? Angela's not some slut. She's our sister. - Don't even think about it. - Don't even think about it! You guys. You guys are sick, you know? No, we're not sick. You look like a bum. What do you got, Louie's hand-me-downs on? Angie, come out and talk to this bum before I stomp him into the stoop. I'm coming. Whoa. What is this? Prom night? Go watch the game. Coleman just homered. - Where you going? - Have something to eat. - Where you taking her? - You going with this guy? Paulie, this doesn't settle anything. - Hey! We'll be waiting. - Right here. The clock is running. Don't wait up. We'll see you in the morning. - Why don't you say something? - I did. Like, I'm not a man. I'm a woman, right? When they pick on me, I can deal with it. You grin and take it. - Your brothers are retarded. - Yeah. I'm serious. Jimmy and Charlie are definitely retarded. - They don't even know. - They don't. Lucky for you, retardation isn't hereditary. - Is it? Cos it might be. - I don't think so. No, you could be retarded. I could be going out with a retarded girl and not even know it. "Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: "it is good for a man not to touch a woman. "Nevertheless, to avoid fornication "let every man have his own wife "and every woman have her own husband." Mmm, mmm, mmm. Well, well. I'll get it. Gator! - Is the Good Reverend Doctor home? - Can't you tell? Yeah, there's Mahalia. Come on in, but please be quiet. This is your father's quiet time. Time for meditation, time for prayer. I'll fix you something to eat, you don't look right. - I look fine. - You been eating? Like a horse, but I'm not hungry. I'll have a candy bar. That's not good eatin'. It's quick energy - sugar, glucose. I'm cooking you something. You don't look like you've been eating regularly. - Did I ask you that already? - Mm-hm. My mind is getting bad. Are you on that stuff again? You promised. I promise, Mama. I'm clean. You don't have to worry. You can rest your heart. That's why I came by. I got this great new job, but there's only one catch. The application calls for a hundred bucks. They say I have the job, but the fee is $100. Boy, you must think you have a fool for a mother. No, I don't! I think I have a great, understanding mother for a mother. - Hush, your foolishness. - I'll pay you back... with my first cheque with interest. I'm trying, Mama, really trying. It's just a lousy $100. Don't tell your father. Lucinda, what is he doing in our home? The "he" is your son, our son. Our first child, Gator. I'm fixing him something to eat. He is not allowed in our home. - But this is his home too. - How much money did he ask for? Gator did no such thing. Go listen to Mahalia while I get him something to eat. Now, go on back inside. Go on. I take care of Gator. You go on back. Gator, dance for me. Do that new move I like. Don't forget to call, as soon as you get that job. I am of the world. I have been out there. The Good Reverend Doctor knows the devil's work is never done. - Food's almost ready. - Devil is always busy. Angie, you can do that in the morning. You've done enough. That's all right. I like to work. - You like to what? - I like to work. Besides, I want my brothers to eat McDonald's tonight. You want your brothers... to eat McDonald's? When I get home, I usually gotta cook for them, and I don't wanna. So I figure if I don't go home they're left to their own... Why are you cooking for them? It's what they expect cos I always do. I think it's time for them to grow up, you know? Dig it, dig it. So, you're a good cook? I mean, you can cook, huh? - Yeah, I can cook. I love to cook. - Oh, yeah? - What? What can you cook? - I can cook anything. - What? Spaghetti? - Yeah, I can cook spaghetti. - L-l-lasagna? - Yeah, lasagna. You like lasagna? - I love lasagna. - Yeah? I'll make lasagna for you. - What? - You're gonna make lasagna for me? Yeah, I'll make it at home and bring it in. I'll come over and eat with your family. You could try. I don't know if... It's a joke. It's just a joke. - I'm joking. - I know, I know. OK. All this talk about food is making me hungry. - Yeah. - Are you hungry? Yeah. Where are you from? Bensonhurst. - Bensonhurst? - Mm. Nice neighborhood. Yeah. Where you from? Uptown. - The Bronx? - No... Harlem. - Harlem, USA. - Wow. You ever been there? No? You've never been to Harlem? No, I never met anybody from Harlem. I mean, not in Bensonhurst anyway. Well, you know, you should... you should go. You'd like it. There's a lot of nice people there. Yeah. - You like it? - When you put soy sauce on it. I don't like the soy sauce so much. What? - What? - What are you looking at? Wait, don't tell me. I know. I know what you're thinking. You're going... "Wow! Look at your skin color." "How dark it is. How... I love your color complexion. "I mean, me, I'm so white, I'm so pale. "I get sun now and then out at Jones Beach. - "But nothing like that!" - I hate the beach. You're definitely not a mind reader. But I admit I was looking at your skin. Boy, it's amazing. You know, this... this preoccupation with color. I mean, here you are staring at me. But my experiences, my people... I have... I've been called every... Black, dot, smut, midnight, spot... Every black derogatory name that you could ever think of. And then white people comment all the time. They love it. It's a deep, dark tan. Oh... sorry. It's... kind of messed up, huh? Yeah, it really is. It's beautiful. You happy? Um... We've been going out for a long time, since high school. How does he treat you? He's all right. Just all right? He's a nice guy, you know? He's just... from the neighborhood, it's a thing I'm outgrowing. Yeah? I'm just saying, I mean, you like all these things, but... you're temping. I think you could be doing a lot more than that. - Guess it's time to go home, right? - Yeah. - You want any more? - No. - Sure? - Positive, positive. So, how long does it take you to get back to Bensonhurst? 40, 45 minutes. And your... boyfriend meets you at the... subway station? - No. - No? No. What, there's no one there waiting for you? - Is that safe? - Yeah. - Let me help you with this. - Thank you. You know, Angie, um... I've never cheated on my wife before. I mean, I'm married. Happily married. I know. I kinda figured that. - Wait. - Ohh. Ohh... What's the matter, Daddy? Is there something wrong? How come you're not talking to me, Daddy? You're usually full of laughs and everything. Bye. Paulie, how many Daily News did you order? 75. How many Posts? 50. How many Newsday? Papa, I order the same number every day and every day you ask me the same question. - I gotta know. - You do know. It never changes. You kidding? Newspapers change every day.

Right here, I'm reading this story here. - Yeah, so what? - I'll tell you what. These Sicilian guys in Louisiana had a factory. It was around 1899, and they gave the black workers equal status in their factory. The regular white people found out and lynched the Italian guys who owned the factory, that's so what. Good! They shouldn't have gotten involved with no niggers! - That's not the point. - That's my fucking point. - Give me the money for Lotto. - Put it on my tab. Give me the money. Tab, my ass. Paulie, give me another chocolate egg cream. That's five egg creams you're drinking. What, does Donna got you in a state? I think she's banging the big blond-headed guy.

One Daily News for your parents and one Newsday for you. Yeah, what else? Have you talked to your father? About what? About the possibility of getting the Times in here. - The Sunday Times at least. - I did. He says it don't sell. It don't sell, he don't order it. Supply and demand. - I'll keep trying though. - Thank you. Here. Oh, I got something for you. I picked up that application from Brooklyn College. It's a lot of information, but don't let that scare you. - Thanks for remembering. - No problem. See you later. Bye. Have a good day. She ain't bad for a black girl. - Enough already, all right? - She's a beautiful girl. - Beautiful. - Every morning the same shit. - I don't believe it. - She looks like that Diana Ross. - Paulie, where's my egg cream? - She does. - Why don't we sell Ebony and Jet? - No Amsterdam News either. Tell her you can get plenty of copies in Bed-Stuy. - Tell her to move over there. - Shut up, Orin is nice people. - You don't know class. - My ass! Gentlemen, I, um... I think we all know why we're here. My contribution to this company's success and growth... speaks for itself. Jerry, Leslie, you know I've worked very hard, put in some very, very long hours. - We know that. - We both know that. And now I think it's time for a vertical move. I have moved as lateral as I can go. And I think the only fair thing to do is to accept me into the position of partner. Now, I'm not making any demands. - I'm just saying... - You're not making any demands? You ask for a partnership? That's not a demand? I'm asking what I'm due. I deserve this. I'm the next one in line. And besides, you promised. - We promised in due time. - "In due time" is what we said. Look, fellows, time is due. Look, we both understand how anxious you are, and how patient you've been. But... we can't do this now. Not at this time. When? Honestly, I can't say. I, uh... Oh. You can't say? Flipper, what is the deal here? What is... Is this an issue of money or is it this new secretary? It's not the secretary. And don't patronize me. - You know I work very hard. - I work very hard too! - I bust my balls. - I do too! I work seven days a week! - How long have you been with us? - From the beginning. What does that say? Mast and Covington! That's my design up there. I set up this goddamn company with... Still... we can't do this now. Well... that really disappoints me. Umm... I can see that you have no respect... for me or my contribution to this company. So you have forced me to turn in my letter of resignation. I can see that I have... no future here at... Mast and Covington. Gentlemen, have a nice day. - Come on, Flipper, come on. - Let him go! Quiet. Flipper, come on. You don't have to... don't walk away... - There's nothing to talk about. - Let him go! This is my work. Mine, mine, mine. You know what? Your ego's out of control. - Who'll play third base for us? - I don't give a damn! - Look, we spent a long... - Mine! - OK... - Mine, mine, mine, mine! - Ego, ego, ego, ego! - Come on, quiet. - Don't tell me to be quiet! - I'm telling you! - What's his problem? - It's been... We've... we've worked together too long... to end a relationship like this. Let's just cool down and talk about this. All we're asking for is a little bit more patience. We don't have any more patience. Fine. If you're that unhappy here... go. Come on. We don't have to deal with this. Look, I'm really sorry. You quit? I resigned. Good. Start your own firm. We need our own businesses. - Exactly. - Let me ask a question. Why are we out here? In this park late at night? - What's the problem? - Why are we out here? You've got to promise me you're not going to tell anybody. Who am I gonna tell? I don't say nothing to nobody. I-I-I-I nothing. You got to promise me. I know you, Cyrus. My lips are sealed. C'mon, what happened? I... I cheated on Drew for the first time. You did that? When did this happen? The other day. Yeah? I thought you were gonna drop a bomb. Well, uh... she's white. White?! Are you on crack?! - You're crazy. - She's Italian. - H-bomb. - From Bensonhurst. Nuclear megaton bomb. - I know you didn't bone her. - No, no, no. Uh-uh. - You got better judgment. - Right, I do. - Good. - My man, that's right. I didn't. - I'm glad you didn't bone her. - Nope, no. - You could have, but you didn't. - Whew. No, no. She put it in your face, but you refused. Cos you are strong. You're a strong black man. Strong black man who... I threw her on the table. Oh, Flipper, you did. You boned her. And I was... You promised, you promised. - Nuclear holocaust. - Hey, man, it just happened. I got a bad feeling about this one. Bad feeling. So what's so important? I'm supposed to go out with Vinny. - You gonna finally have a wedding? - No... I don't know. - You're wearing that ring. - Why are you so happy? - It isn't about Paulie. - She's glowing. I'm not glowing. - So what is it? - What's going on? All right, but you gotta swear. Like on a stack of bibles. - Swearing on a zillion rosary beads. - I swear on my great-grandmother. - We swear, what? - I'm seeing somebody. - Yeah? You two-timing? - Who are you seeing? - Somebody from work. - That new job? - That was quick. - A very fancy place. So what's he look like? Who is this guy? - What's his name? - It's a weird name. - Try me. - Flipper. Flipper? What the fuck kind of name is Flipper? I told you it's a weird name. Don't laugh. Is he a blond, blue-eyed surfer type? - Hey, dude! - Right? What is that? He's black. - Something wrong? - Black? - You did it with a black guy? - Yeah. If your father finds out... - He's not gonna. - Of course not! - Not from us. - I'm just saying, keep it quiet. - Look at Gina. - Gina who? She brought a black guy in. Look what they did to him. Why you talking about that Puerto Rican crackhead? She brought him in and they killed the guy. You better be careful. She's not stupid enough to bring him in. - Whatever. - Our lips are sealed. Personally, I think it's pretty disgusting. - Really? - Yeah, I think it's gross. - How could...? - Hey. Me, personally, I could never... You're not sleeping with the guy. What do you care? She's a beautiful girl, she can have any guy. Why go with a moolie? I mean, Jesus Christ. I mean... This is the '90s. There's nothing wrong with it. You having a good time? I have to admit I've always been curious about Caucasian women. That doesn't mean that white is right and sisters aren't beautiful. Sisters are beautiful too. But, hey, I mean, I was curious, so... I just jumped on it. - Literally. - Yes, indeedy. I mean, hey, hey, that doesn't mean to say... that because a brother is with a white girl that he's less down, I mean, less progressive. - I'm still very pro-black. - You're black all right. My shit is correct, very correct. You got a big problem. You and her. Both of you's got the fever. - The what? - The fever. The both of you's got jungle fever. The both of you's. We get some money we're going back to that... Babe bro! All right! Come on, baby. - Don't push me, nigger. - Don't start. Nigger, don't push on me. He done stepped into the cash money thing. Mr Flip-man! Yo, babe bro! Cyrus! Black men! Successful and shit. Meet my new woman, Viv. That's short for Vivian. She's good people. I like her. Mm! I was most fortunate to make her acquaintance recently. That's my baby brother, the one I been telling you about. He a architect and shit. And that's his main man, Cyrus. He a, uh... Damn. W-w-what is it you do again? - I teach high school. - That's right. He a high school teacher and shit. Hey, sorry. My mind's getting bad. - I gotta go. - You leaving me? I gotta go. - You promised. - I promise. My lips are sealed. Uh, Vivian, nice to meet you. Gator, peace, two fingers. Peace. Viv, would you let two loving brothers get a moment alone to get reacquainted and shit? - Where the fuck do I go?! - I don't give a fuck! - Sit in a fucking swing and wait! - A swing?! Motherfucker, it's cold! I'm tryin' to get some motherfucking money! Do I look like a fool?! Get this in your mouth, smoke this shit! - Give me a motherfucking light! - Take this! - Carry your motherfucking ass! - Hurry your ass! - Fuck! - Get the money! Motherfucker! Shit! - Go, go, go! - It's cold out here! I don't care if you freeze your fucking ass off! - Tired of your motherfucking ass! - Shit. Oh, I like her. Mm! Look here, baby brother. I'm a little light right now. Could you let me hold some change? No. No, Gator. No, no, no. That dancing shit ain't gonna work. I ain't giving you a red cent. What? Come on, you can do me this one solid. Would you rather I go out and rob some elderly person? Steal? Either way, I'm gonna get high. I really hate having to resort to knocking elderly people in the head for their money. But I'll do it. I'll do it. You know I'll do it. ♪ I'll do it, I'll do it ♪ You know I'll do it ♪ I like getting high ♪ Uh-uh uh ♪ I'm a c-c-c-c-crackhead ♪ I like to get high ♪ I'm a c-c-c-c c-c-c-c crackhead ♪ My brother. - Tch. Yeah. Yo, Viv! - What, motherfucker?! I'm not doing this any more. Come on! That's it, Gator! That's it! Come on! Motherfucker! I don't care! - I got fifty fucking dollars. - $50! - Get off me! - Motherfucker! Ladies, we have one chicken livers and onions with candied yams and collard greens, and one Sylvia's World-Famous Talked-About Barbecue Ribs Special - with potato salad and peas? - Right. - Two iced teas? - Thank you. - Can I get you anything else? - No, that's fine. I really should have done this a long time ago. Break away and start my own business. You staying to work at Mast and Covington? I'm a temp secretary, remember? Yeah. Damn it. Excuse me, miss, miss. May we order, please? - May I take your order? - Is this your station? Yes, it is. Unfortunately. You could have taken my order 30 minutes ago when I sat... Can I take YOUR order? Excuse me, do you have a problem? Yes, I do have a problem, to be honest. Fake, tired brothers like you coming in here. That's so typical. I can't believe you brought her stringy-haired ass here. Let me tell you, it's not your business who I bring in here. Parade your white meat somewhere else. You are a waitress. Your job is to wait. Today's specials are the Maryland crab cakes, Creole shrimp gumbo and blackened catfish. I suggest you have the blackened catfish. - I suggest you find the manager. - You want my manager? Oh, it's like that, right? All right, fine. I'll get my manager. - You're fired! - You're tired! - She's white. - Mm-hm. I love her. She's great. We have a great marriage, a great daughter. What does she do? She's a buyer for Bloomingdale's. So, what are we doing? I honestly... don't know. I guess I don't expect you to leave her. Well, I'm not. So, then... what are we doing? I don't think we're just fooling around. All right, is it true that black men don't like to go down on women? Come on, you heard that, right? - Don't tell me you didn't. - Untruth, untruth. Like white boys have Mini-Frosted Wheaties dicks? - Why? Is that true? - I don't know. You tell me. - I don't know. - It's not true. Of course not. It's a myth... I think. Take it! Take all his stuff. Just take it. Take everything. Cyrus, leave his stuff alone! Take all his stuff, the papers, blueprints, clothes! - Take it on home! - Hey! Yo, Drew! Drew! - I don't want it! Get it out! - Give it back. Drew, what did I do? Don't you give it back, Cyrus! Hey! Gimme that! - Put that back! Drew! - I don't want it in my house. Don't throw my papers out! Drew, what did I do? - Tell me what I did. - You're a liar and bastard. - A what? - A bastard and a liar, fuckhead! - What is she talking about? - She's hip to Angie. - Throw out the refrigerator! - Wait, wait. Drew, listen, listen! Hey, I can explain! Explain? Explain a white bitch you're fucking, motherfucker?! Vera, take Ming to your apartment. Take her to your apartment! Don't talk to her! That's my friend! You shut the fuck up! - Drew?! - Don't listen to him! Do we have to discuss this out here in front of all of Harlem? We don't have shit to discuss! Discuss that! Listen, listen! What am I gonna do about the business? Oh, fuck your fucking business! The house was gonna be my office. You better get a new house then, asshole! Give me this. Get off of it! Look... look, baby! Baby! Baby! Flipper Purify, there will be no penis between us! Asshole! We can talk this out. I know we can talk this out. Let us pray. Heavenly father, make us thankful for this, thy bounty we are receiving for the nourishment of our bodies. In the name of thy son Jesus. - Amen. - Amen. So... you have been cast out of your home like Jonah was cast out of the belly of the whale. I pray adultery was not the cause? - Daddy, it's complex. - Let the boy eat his meal. You don't have to answer. I know you and Drew will work this out. Was it the temptation of the sweet nectar of another woman's fruit? The devil is always at work. People are responsible for their own actions. The devil had little to do with it. Thinking like that led you from the straight and narrow. Do you ever just talk? Let him who is without sin cast the first stone. Straight and narrow? Not you, not me and definitely not you. You and me come from the same crooked straits. That's the end of this conversation. Go get your wife back. You need each other. And Ming needs you. Please, now, let's eat this meal in peace. Hmm! She ain't nothin' but a low-class white trash... She probably didn't even finish high school. - You know that's the truth. - That's what he left me for. I always thought Flipper was the ideal husband. You can never tell. I promise you, they're all dogs! That's right. We have to start datin' white men. - It's true. - I'm not datin' no white man. - Ain't no good black men. - There are. Most of them are drug addicts, in jail, homos... The good ones know they are so they got 10 women, leaving babies all over. My marriage is wrecked. He's fucking some white bitch and I still believe there's good black men out there. Where? What are the options? Be a nun, be gay, or see somebody who likes you no matter what. - Chinese, black, white, whatever. - You're wrong as the day is long. They're out there. But we're looking in the wrong places. I don't know where we're lookin' but we're not lookin' at bus drivers or truck drivers or garbage men. We just won't give 'em the time of day, but they're good men. How many men do you know - black men - who can deal with a mate who has more education and makes more money? They freak, and that's the truth. The fact remains that we are losing our men. That's the bottom line. A lot of this isn't to do with black men. We want to blame them, and it is their blame. Part of it is that white bitches throw themselves at black men. You see the way they look at 'em? You can't walk with your man without white bitches comin' on to 'em. They give up their pussy because their fathers kept it from them. When they turn 18 and leave home they're gonna get that black dick. They gonna get it. It can be yours or mine, they want it. And they're gettin' it. Deal with the black man for a minute. There's a lot of self-hate, he can't deal with his sister. How would you know? You won't deal with them. I date black men - and Chinese, Latino, Jewish - the full spectrum. That's not really a consolation for this argument. You think I should date black men, but I'll date who I like. Give me a man, regardless of his color, who is nice to me, who is sweet to me, and who I believe loves me. - It's not about the color. - I'm not the rainbow-fucking kind. You are the leading rainbow girl. We know this about you. I'll make a pilgrimage to Africa, the motherland, and find myself a tribesman. - A true Asiatic black man. - With a dick down to his knees, to keep me happy for days. - Ooh! Zulu dick! - That's right. Some serious Zulu dick in the bush. What a nasty! Do you know what it is like not being attractive? You believe that? It's the kind of shit you buy into. I was always the darkest one in my class. You know what I'm talking about. Guys ran after the light-skinned girls with straight hair. And that same thinkin' leaves us out when it comes to white women. Back in the day, brothers would get sisters that looked like you. But now, light skin ain't even good enough. Today, brothers are going for the real McCoy. That's why Flipper's gone. White girls got it made. The whole thing... everything in society, we keep on doin' the same thing over and over. We keep negatin' ourselves and our values. Look at the brothers who are successful. Most of the brothers who made it got white women on their arms, OK? In order to go up that ladder to success, you got to have "Miss Thing" on your arm. Their responsibility level isn't the same as ours. It's just a fundamental disrespect... for women. I don't care, the best man, it's hard for him to say no, some pussy starin' him in his face. I don't know the man that's been born that'll say no. He look around, nobody lookin', he gonna fuck the pussy. In a committed relationship you are supposed to be able to say no. It's the "art of no" theory for me. If you're involved with this person, you have no business... I mean, I know you gonna get turned on. You see somebody you wanna fuck, but your mind should say, "I have a committed relationship, a wife, whatever," and tell the dick to shut the fuck up and get down. Strap that motherfucker down! You know? You know somethin', though? It don't even matter what color she is. My man is gone. - Nah, Flipper. Nah. - I wanna talk to Drew. There's a war council goin' on in your living room. Where's Ming? Asleep, upstairs with us. Let's take a walk. How did Drew bust me? Don't tell me it was because you opened your big mouth? Goddamn. See... I trusted you! You see what happens? If I can't tell my wife, who can I tell? Nobody, nobody! Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody! I told you, don't tell a soul. You promised me. Are you 411 or somethin'? How was I supposed to know Vera was gonna tell Drew? - I didn't know that shit. - Use your better judgment! She is a woman. Women stick together. They always do and always will. Now I'm thrown out because of your no-keepin'-a-secret, married-to-a-blabbermouth wife! Don't talk about my wife. You need a place to stay, stay with us as long as you want. But don't talk about my wife! Yeah, right. Right. And be spied on all night? I'd rather live with the FBI and the CIA! She would be giving hourly reports of everything I did to Drew. Miss... Big-Mouth! Hey, did big mouth say go fuck that lady? We had nothin' to do with that shit. Put the fuckin' blame on the blamee - you, not me. That's right. Why you laughin'? Cos you fucked me up, that's why I'm laughin'. I didn't mean that shit. - "You got a place to stay." - So your marriage is fucked up. - I didn't mean it. - Fuck you. It was a mistake. I shouldn't have told her. She has a big fuckin' mouth. ♪ Well the night is young ♪ And the stars are out ♪ And your eyes are all aglow... ♪ Excuse me, miss. Can you help me, please? Flipper, why are you here? - Drew, these are for you. - I don't want them. - I need to talk. - I don't want to talk to you! - All right. - Sorry. Not out here, please. In my office. All right. Look, baby, I know you're upset, but... I guess I just wasn't light enough for you, was I?! You had to eventually go get yourself a white girl. What do you mean, "eventually"? What I mean is you've got a complex about color! All the girls you ever dated have been light-skinned girls! You and Cyrus! Both of you! You don't know the women I dated before we met. It's cos you're so black, you have a problem. - That's insane! That's insane! - Yes. Yes! I told you what happened to me when I was growin' up. I've poured my heart out. How they called me high yellow, yellow bitch. White honky, honky white, white nigger, nigger white, octoroon, half-breed, mongrel, and what do you do? - Do you love this girl? - Ohh! Oh, Drew. - You've gotta be kidding me. - Do you love her? - I love you. - Do you love her? No! No, no, no. No, I don't. I'm so glad for you. So glad. Cos don't you know white people hate black people cos they're not black? They can't relate. Did your white father hate your black mother? - You talkin' about my family? - This is what I'm saying! - Color's got you fucked up too! - Maybe it has! Maybe it has! Maybe that's why this hurts me so much! Can't you see that?! I trusted you. I... - And I loved you. - And you still do. Oh, please, don't tell me what I feel! I don't. And I won't again.

Locking yourself in the john like a little girl! All because of some... some skirt! Not some skirt! It's Angie. She's a woman. You call that a woman?! I was married to a real woman. Your mother. That was a woman! - I wanted to marry Angie. - She did you a big favor. Marriage to her would have been hell. Besides, marriage today is a joke. People get married, divorced, married. All they think marriage is for is humping. They don't know the duties. - What duties? - Wifely duties. Those kind of women are rare. Your mother and me, we had our wars. She didn't talk to me for almost... two years, not... not a word. Still, she scrubbed my back. Never stopped doin' her duties. That woman was there for me. "Till death do us part." That... was a fuckin' marriage. Sometimes when I'm alone, she says to me, "Lou... "kiss me." But I... I try.

Look what I've got for you. She's beautiful. Yes, she is. Daddy, Mommy takes me the wrong way to school every day. - She does? - Yeah. Well, there's more than one way to go to school. I still like our way, Daddy. I miss you and Mommy making funny noises in the morning. Your mother's the loud one. Wakes up all of Harlem. It doesn't bother me. I wish you and Mommy were back together making those funny noises. You coming home? - Uh, go ask your mother. - I did. She told me to ask you. - Well, go ask your mother. - I just did. Yo, daddy. I'll suck your dick good for five dollars. - You what? - Five dollars. - Get off me! - Five dollars! All right, three dollars. Motherfucker! Fuck you! Why don't you watch where you're goin', man? Now, you listen to me. If you ever use drugs, I'll kill you. Understand? I didn't do anything! My dear, are you a Catholic? Umm... I went to Catholic school so I guess I am by now. Hmm. In this house, we are Baptists. The Good Reverend Doctor was the head of his own flock, the Hard Rock Baptist Church. The devil and his cohorts conspired to oust me from my congregation. Now, Daddy, you know the devil ain't had nothin' to do with it. It was you. You and your stubbornness. That's all. "For it must needs be that offenses come into the world, "but woe unto him by whom the offense cometh." I recognize the devil's handiwork when I see it. That's good. Please, let's not argue at the dinner table. Flipper, have you met Angie's folks? Not as of yet. Well, my mother passed away and my father, he's, um... he's asked me to leave. - I'm sorry. - That's all right. I just don't think we'll be having dinner there soon. Has Flipper told you about his loving wife and daughter? Yes, he has. Um, excuse me. You think I don't understand about white women committing black adultery, but I do. Now, Daddy, no sermons, please. There was a lot of lynchings in Willicoochee, Georgia where I come from. Willicoochee, Georgia! What a name! Willicoochee. White man say to his woman, "You are the flower of white Southern womanhood, "too holy and pure to be touched by any man, including me. "I'm gonna put you up on a pedestal "so the whole world will fall down and worship you. "And if any nigger so much as look at you, "I'll lynch his ass." She believed him, thought she really was holy and pure, like the Virgin Mary. She let him put her up on that pedestal. Meanwhile, the husband, no sooner the sun went down, down to the slave quarters grabbin' every piece of black poontang he could lay his hands on, then running to the gin mill to brag about it. And that's how our blood got diluted. Mulattoes, quadroons, octoroons. I'm sure that most of those high and mighty white ladies felt abandoned. But they were so proud to be white, and therefore superior, they kept their mouths shut and their legs locked tight. But in the midnight hour, layin' there, alone, on the hot bed of lust, I'm sure they must've thought what it would be like to have one of them big, black bucks that their husbands were so desperately afraid of. I feel sorry for you. It's the nineties. Still tryin' to make up for what you missed. But I don't blame you. As for the black man... like my own son, Flipper, who ought to know better, got a loving wife and daughter, still got to fish in the white man's cesspool, I have nothing but contempt. Excuse me. I don't eat with whore-mongers. But you knew she was comin'! That's all right, Mama. That's all right. Angie, we're leavin'. Let's go. Mama, I'm sorry. But you invited them. Great. One good thing that's happened all night, a parking space. Comin' out? - Mmm. - Uhhh! - Uh! Hey, hey. - Ohh... Don't mess with me, I got two rough brothers. Yeah? Who do you think taught Tyson? - Gus D'Amato. - Gus D'Amato? But when he died, I taught him everything. - You wouldn't hit me with glasses. - Yes, I would. All those good Italian boxers there are? Graciano, yeah, Marciano. - Lamotta! - Lamotta?! Yeah. How's that? What about Ali? - I hate Ali. - What? Ali preached hate on white people. I'll kill you, you ever talk about Muhammad Ali! - You're a witch! - Get off! I'll never stand for you to talk about the greatest, Muhammad Ali. That's you... a heretic witch! OK, game over. Game over. Gimme my glasses. - Say please. - I'm not gonna say please. That won't stop me being angry. Get your hands up! Put 'em up, I said! Get your hands up! Get your hands up. - Back away. - Get your hands up... now! Move! - What'd I do? - Against the wall! - You all right, ma'am? - I'm all right. Let go of me. - That's my boyfriend! - We're just lovers... just friends! - This must be some kind of mistake! - Angie, shut up! Just shut up! - He wasn't trying to rape you?! - No! - I didn't do anything! - Take the gun from his head! - Talk to me! What?! - It's just a big misunderstanding. Slow. Turn around. Slow. - I was seein' she got home safe. - All right. Sorry about that. No harm, no foul. A call said an Afro-American male was attacking a Caucasian woman. You all right, man? No problem. What? What?! Give me a reason, man! - Don't you dare! - Better luck next time. Are you crazy? I have your badge! I'll bring you up on charges! - Shut up! - I'm gonna report this. Why'd you tell 'em we're lovers? You tryin' to get me killed?! - It's none of their business! - What a waste. Shit! What the fuck am I doin' here? - Let's go. - Don't touch me. No, no, no.

Listen I... I... Do you think you could be attracted to a white boy? A white boy. Could this white boy be Paulie Carbone? Possibly. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe. I would have to think about it. Why don't you think about it? OK. But can I be honest with you? I have never thought of you in that way. - I'm sorry. - I like you. You're serious. Why? Why me? You really wanna know? - You wanna know? - Yeah, I wanna know. You're intelligent and I find you very... very attractive. Well, thank you. That's nice. It's sweet. But I got to get to work. I have a class later. I gotta go. Bye. Remember, think about it on the way to the subway. Yeah, right. You see this shit? I don't believe it. Don't believe it. You'll burn your brain out. - You trying to rap Miss Goody? - Goode. Goode, whatever. Doesn't even talk to us. - Who does she think she is? - Orin talks to whoever talks to her. She said good morning to me one time. Paulie, did you fuck her? Did you fuck her? You know, colored women... - they like to fuck. - Oh, yeah? You put a saddle on them, you ride them into the sunset. I'm telling you, they love it. - How do you know? - He asked his mother. What's that supposed to mean? My mother's not black. She's dark. There are dark Italians. - I'm as white as anybody here. - Relax! - We're busting your balls. - My brother ain't no crackhead. - Frankie! - Tony's on methadone. - Fuckin' addict. - He's a recovering heroin addict! - So fuck you. - Fuck me? Fuck you! Don't talk about my brother! Your brother's a thief! He stole my car radio! - How do you know? - He tried to sell it back to me! Nobody listens to you anyway! - Ask Sonny! - Fuck Sonny! Fuck Sonny?! I'm gonna wring your neck! Come on! Come on! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! - Come on! - Take it easy, man! Go get a job or do something else somewhere else! Leave me alone.

Right? - Yeah, whatever you say, Vinny. We're just friends, all right? Friends! No such thing. Either you're doin' it, or you're not doin' it. And you're not doin' it! You're jealous because she speaks to me every morning. - We're dyin' of envy here, Paulie. - Hey! Hey, Paulie. Seen Angie lately? You miss her, right, Paulie? She's livin' in Harlem. Bought a Kanga. Got a pair of unlaced Jordans, too. Shut your mouth! - I'm not... - Don't laugh. Eat your fuckin' cake. Get outta here. I'll bury you, ya fuck. OK, Mama. It's all right. It's all right. I don't know what's wrong with Gator! I've prayed so much for him. He'll give me a heart condition. - What did he do now? - Gator left before you got here. Come over wantin' to borrow the color TV. For what? To watch the Mets, see Gooden pitch. I said he couldn't watch it here because the Good Reverend Doctor would raise hell if he saw him. - What happened then? - He got mad. Unplugged the TV, picked it up, just walked on out. Said he'd bring it back after the game. Look, Mama. Listen. Just... Mama, you can forget about the TV. You should also forget about Gator. In the end he'll break your heart. Hush your foolishness. The good Lord knows I raised you two the best I know how. Gator is your oldest brother, our first child. - Your first child is a crackhead. - Don't say that! - It's the truth. - Don't say that! He is not a crackhead. It's not your fault or the Good Reverend Doctor's fault, and it ain't nothin' to do with the devil. Find him and get the TV back before your father comes home. Mama, please listen to me. Forget about the TV, OK? I don't want to hear another word! Do as I say. Find your brother and get the Good Reverend Doctor's TV back. All right. All right. Love ya a heap.

Their skin is lighter than mine. No octoroon, quadroon, mulatto... babies. No. Don't you have a daughter who's got white blood in her? Yeah, so what? Look, at least in my eyes, Drew and Ming are black. They look black, they act black, so they are black! It's hard enough just being black out here. No. A lot of times the mixed kids they come out all mixed-up, a bunch of mixed nuts. You're not that much different than my family. Your family is racist! What is this stuff you're talking now? Angie? Angie! I'll be damned. Ain't that some shit? Would you like me to tell you what happened? I still care about you, Paulie. How do you feel? How do you expect me to feel? I don't feel the same.
