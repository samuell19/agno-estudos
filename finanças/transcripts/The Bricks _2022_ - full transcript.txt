You expect us to believe after being locked up with Tomas Jeffries for five months that you didn't get a shred of information that will bring forth on the indictment of the Jones Brothers? Woman, what you think this is? You think you can just throw me in prison with Tomas Jeffries and he gonna trust me with this deepest secrets? You knew it wasn't gonna go down like that when you sent me in there. Please tell me again, why did we send him in there? Obviously, he wasn't man enough for the job. Hey. You know why you sent me in there? Yeah, why is that? Because anybody else would've come out in a body bag. Hmm. Did you get anything we could use? You already know the answer. So, this is what we need to know about the Jones Brothers. Lamar Jones, the eldest of the brothers, and although we have no physical proof, word is Lamar is the brain of the operation. Did six years for drug distribution when he was 18. But since he's been out, his record has been squeaky clean. Lamar owns a rehabilitation facility where he teaches the neighborhood kids how to box and play sports. But we have an informant that tell us Lamar is still very much into the narcotic game. ♪ Try to force you to move things by 10 a week ♪ ♪ So pay attention ♪ ♪ Street's too quiet, the bears might do a sweep ♪ ♪ Welcome to The Bricks ♪ ♪ Just the realest this shit finna get ♪ ♪ When you niggas pull up better ♪ ♪ Tell us, homey, who you with ♪ ♪ If it ain't a dollar on the block ♪ ♪ We'll get it out a bitch ♪ ♪ If the plug ain't coming up ♪ ♪ Drozzy bringing in the shit ♪ ♪ 9601 ♪ ♪ She says she knew I was ♪ ♪ She could tell just by my aura ♪ ♪ I said you lying queen, you lying ♪ ♪ Don't you see all this before ♪ ♪ See my face and at the source ♪ ♪ Was smoked and I'm a forest ♪ ♪ Fool, light it you a tourist ♪ ♪ Niggas plotting making a rolls ♪ Okay, don't look yet, but the guy talking to the bartender, that's the middle brother. Deidrick Jones. That's their star safety from high school. Boy got a full scholarship to go to college. He was plagued with his all field problem, aggravated assault, possession of a firearm. The list goes on. College coaches tried to cover it up until they send him back home packing. We got intel that says Deidrick is smuggling over 500 kilos a month through his company trucks of course. But every time we try to seize 'em, we came up empty. ♪ Guaranteed to make you rich ♪ Goddamn, boy, fuck happened to face, bro? Last but not least, Marcus Jones, the youngest of the brothers, but definitely probably the most infamous. Last year, some guys from the east side cartel tried to rob him and a shootout occurred. Say, homey, man we got a whole situation going on right now, man. Fix it. Man, this dumb-ass nigga got robbed, man. No he didn't. Word is Marcus shot two suspects on the spot and ran two blocks just to gun down the other. The only motherfuckers I know getting robbed is bitches. You a bitch? So, that make me a bitch then. That's what I thought. Now, go get my motherfucking money Man, get your bitch as up. Get your ass outta here. If that nigga don't have my money by tomorrow. Shit, you know what I'm saying, small talk, big action. Gotcha, homey. Got off on self defense charges, 'cause he was shot six times. Police found him unconscious at the scene. That number Tomas Jeffries gave you belonged to several burners. We believe was purchased by none other than his son, Melvin Jeffries. Melvin and the Jones brothers have a jaded past, and if there's any angle that we can play here, it's through Melvin. That's right. It's said that Tomas brokered a deal for his son's protection with the Jones brothers. You know the deal is Tomas would give up a few of his distribution routes, as long as they cut a 50/50 deal with his son, Melvin. Sounds like y'all have all the information you need. No, no, no-no-no-no. You see nobody's gonna testify against the Jones brothers. All we have right now is a few crackheads and felons lying and telling stories to try to reduce their sentence. Look, we need something concrete, a wiretap or video surveillance, something that's gonna prove that this thing's being orchestrated by the brothers. Now we're gonna give you a long leash here, because we don't need any chances of detection. But if you need us, you call us on this phone. That it? Mother. But first, we have the news. It was a grim day in history. The horror was unforgettable, but so was the courage. Coming up, one man remembers how a massacre changed so many. This is not what we agreed upon. I cannot tolerate murder in your cell in the broad daylight. Would you rather it was me covered in my own blood, laid out here on the floor? How's Tammy? She like the new car? Your story better stick, 'cause one inaccuracy, this whole thing goes bad. All right, don't forget. If it goes bad, it goes bad for both of us. But don't worry, contingencies have been taken. What about that other thing? How's that going? The seeds have been planted. Now we just waiting to see what kind of fruit grow. No more bodies. You think we can trust that nigger Clarence on the outside? I think- Don't think, don't. Don't think. Coming up next, a man gets more than he bargained for when he falls in love. So you was locked up with my old man, huh? How he holding up in there? He all right? Man, your old man runs that prison. He's straight. Of course, he does. So what do he say about me? He talk about me a lot or no? You know he don't let me call him, paranoid or some shit like that. He's smart to be. Hell, yeah, he talked about you, all the time. He proud of you. So look, he wants me to put you on with our partners. Yeah? Who are they? And the first lesson you'll learn from me today is this. Don't ever ask about them, not to me, not to anybody. I like to know who I'm dealing with before I get my hands dirty. Everybody ain't built the same out here. True, but if words gets out that you asking those questions, man, it ain't gonna matter. Look man, all you need to know is this. You listen to me, you'll make a lot of money. But all money ain't good money. Now, I know you've been hanging around my old man too long, 'cause I ain't never met a dollar I ain't like. I'm about to introduce you to my girl, Kenya. She's the common ground between my family and the partners. So, you don't do business with them directly? Long story, but we ain't got the best history. And on top of that, them niggas trust is shit. Heard. Hello to you, too. Hey. What you got for me today? Huh, yeah, right. Where the money at? This Clarence. He was locked up with my old man. Came to Houston to see how the real hustlers do it. Nice to meet you, Clarence. I'm Kenya. Nice to meet you, too. Well look, glad to see y'all getting along and shit, 'cause he gonna be staying here for a minute. - What? - What? You can put your bag in, in the back. It's cool. What the fuck, Melvin? Look, this ain't no motherfucking daycare. I'm not about to be watching no grown-ass man. You ain't look like you was having a problem watching him to me. Look, don't let him out of your sight. If he checks out, and you say we can trust him, then we bring him in. And if not? Shit, either way he's out of your house. Fuck! I didn't know. I know, but it's cool. I just don't like surprises, that's all. But you're here now. That's the restroom through that door over there. There's a shower and everything. If you need anything, let me know. We already talked about this. Come on, man, just let me see him. Look, you said I could see him. I told you how this shit gonna work. My way or no way. Fuck, you understand? Just, just let me see him. I just wanna see him. Look, I promise I won't leave this time. And fuck all that.

Let's talk about how you can trust me, but you won't allow me to trust you. What? Clarence. Clarence. Clarence. What are you doing? I thought you was different. So you saying I'm not? No, you not different. You just like every other girl running around here, dumping her problems off on anybody who willing to help. I put myself through that shit before. I ain't doing it again. From now on, whatever energy I get, I'm giving back. What are you even talking about Clarence? You know what I'm talking about. Exactly. What's going on? I can't say anything. Look, my son life depends on it. Where is your son? I can't tell you. It's complicated. What's complicated? Tell me something. When I was younger I had a baby. My baby daddy wasn't shit, but I loved him so. I guess I wasn't shit either. He stashed a brick in my car for a drop off. But later that night a friend of ours came to our house and told me he was murdered. They shot him over a fucking chain. I grabbed my keys and hopped in the car and rushed out the house. I tried to get to where he was as soon as possible. It wasn't until I got there I realized I, I'm just gonna be raising my son alone. That I actually forgot my baby at home by himself. So I hop back in the car, and I started speeding on the freeway. Just trying to get home to him. Just to make sure he was safe. But on my way I got stopped by the cops. They saw the blood all over my clothes, so they decided to search the car. And they found the dope. Yep. But we got a friend. He claimed he was so fucking loyal to Blaze. He took the charge. He said it was so I could get home to my son. When I got there my baby was, he was sleep. He was safe, sleeping all peacefully. But the fucked up part is, I've been paying for it ever since. What that got to do with old boy? Marcus? His name is Marcus. He's one of our friends too. But the guy who took the charge, it's Marcus's big brother at the bar. They've been controlling my life ever since.

So how we move is important. Detective might see a woman walking the sub apartment, but it's all just the front, because we own 70% of the building. We have underground tunnels that are for each and every operation. Workers go into one door and then go into an apartment that no one knows about.

It's not so much a competition. I mean you're here for another 10 years. Look, besides you're making millions of dollars just sitting on the sidelines. So, man, just play your part. Play my part. The brothers are taking your place. So what was once yours is now theirs. Man, just be happy they allow your precious son the luxury of life, because we both know you and I would not. Shit. What the fuck is this? Work nigga, what? You think you got 20,000 in your pocket just for fucking the boss man niece? Crazy. Fuck wrong with this nigga? What we supposed to do, bury the body? We? We ain't doing a motherfucking thing. You going bury that motherfucker, you hear me. Time to get your hands dirty, nigga. Come on man, let's go smoke this blunt. I don't know why they always stick us with these new ass niggas. - Last nightSouthwest Houston. - Guess you saw the news, huh? Local pharmacy owner, Sonny Patel, was beaten and gunned down. Who do you think it was? Police are saying he may have been robbed of several cases of prescription narcotic medication. I'm looking at who I think it was. You know there was nothing I could do, right? But you could have told me something. Give me a heads up. Anything. A heads up? Clarence, look, I really, really like you, but you know there's no way I can mix business with pleasure. If they found out I was giving you information, man they'll kill me. And you know I got too much to lose. You know no matter what I'm gonna protect you, right? From who? Marcus? Not just him, anyone or anything. You're so cute. Look, just remember, don't ask no questions, okay. Just try to blend in and have fun. I mean this is a very, very important event. All the important people are here, and you're this close to being a part of the family. Don't fuck this up. Put me in the game, coach. So I heard that the owner of this house is a Mexican drug lord. And he throws this party every year just to get in good with the locals. Excuse my wife. Alcohol seems to give her a bit of a imagination. No, it does not. Whoever it is, I heard he's loaded. Yeah, perhaps I heard he had bits of powerful friends as well. Is that the mayor? Excuse me. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Follow me. Fucking serious. Listen, I'm not here for you. There's a girl inside who didn't make it to check in. I was hoping to see her here, but there's no sign of her. Did you check the safe houses? Nothing there. I'm starting to think maybe her cover was blown. Well what's her name? Maybe I can dig something up for you. You don't trust me. That's not protocol. We protect all our deep covers with 100% anonymity. And that's the only way we can keep it. Cut the bullshit, Kim. You know as well as I know, as deep as these guys' pockets are, they have ways to find out other links. Hell, you can be a link just as much as any one of us can. Give me a name. I'll see what I can do. Nicole. Wait, Nicole. - You knew her? - No. I'm just trying to remember where I know that name. Probably the other day at the bar. She was the one serving the drinks. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were seeing someone. What? Your girlfriend, she must be a lucky girl. Sorry, I imposed. Yeah, no problem. Nice seeing you again. Who's that bitch? Oh no, that was just some woman I met at the club the other night. She said she knew me definitely, but I don't remember her. Besides, I had to tell her I was seeing someone. I like how you don't make me crazy. Crazy, with all these people here? Shit, about 40 more seconds, I was gonna fuck it up for all of us. Anyways, they're about to have a toast. I wouldn't miss it. I finna to go to the ladies room. I'll meet you up there. - All right. - Okay. May I help you? I know exactly what you are. And what am I, little girl? You just like all the other women. Want something that don't belong to them. Girl, your man is too young. I was just looking for a little excitement. I got your excitement, bitch. Wow, you had me fooled for a second. Look at you with that beautiful dress. You look amazing. For a second I thought you was a respectable woman. You can take the bitch out the hood, but you can't take the hood out the bitch. That bitch. As mayor of this amazing city, I'd like to celebrate these two brilliant men for helping Houston continue its reign as one of the finest cities in the country. Between the countless donations and the heartfelt contributions with the inner city youth, these two have achieved their very own day. So congratulate these two by giving them a big round of applause and here for today, being known as Jones Day. Wow. Thank you for such a prestigious honor, Mayor. Appreciate it man. Looking forward to continue to building this beautiful place we call home. Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for coming out. I'm sure y'all didn't come to hear about all the contributions that my brothers and I have done for the city. Y'all come to celebrate a good year. And what better way to do that other than party? So let's party, turn up. ♪ Let's see how y'all bang ♪ ♪ This that big old drip ♪ - Let's take this shit over. - Nigga, we already did. ♪ She wanna make a movie on my headphone ♪ ♪ She wanna sit on dick ♪ ♪ Mix her off white with the fish scale ♪ ♪ Just hit a big old lick ♪ ♪ This that big old drip ♪ ♪ This that big old drip ♪ ♪ This that big old drip ♪ ♪ This that big old drip ♪ ♪ Mix it off white with the fish scale ♪ Ciao. Everything all right? Yeah, will be, if we can handle the new shipment. New shipment? I ain't green light a new shipment. Neither did I. But evidently my people back home have a load that never made it to its destination. Fuck it. Send it back. It's not that easy. You know this, Lamar. You can't just send back 600. You can't just ship 600 kilos back to Mexico. You know this. You know we don't work like this. We need time. Speaking of time, when that shit supposed to get here anyway? Two days. Not happening. What's not gonna happen? Hernandez trying to force a shipment on us. Not happening? Did you forget how powerful my family is? What do you think they're gonna say if you say no? Sound like a you problem. Are you ready for what might happen if you don't take the shipment? Crazy. I think I speak for my brothers when I say this. You love doing business with you and your family, but we don't take orders or lay down for nobody. Look, Lamar. No one's asking you to lay down for anyone. Consider this a favor for a favor. And what exactly do we get in return for this favor? See? Now, we're talking. When you take the load- If. If we take the load. If you take the load, all 600 kilos will be given to you at half the price. And after that, the next five shipments will be delivered to you. I'll take full risk and responsibilities for all deliveries. If we decide to do this, we do this under our terms. Absolutely under your terms, gentlemen. Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna go catch up with a few ladies downstairs. And Dedrick, man, I always love your parties. You never lack the essentials. Oh, yeah, and what's that? Pussy. This guy, man. Listen, I need an answer by the morning. So what y'all think? I mean, it ain't how things usually go, but half off, that's a lot. Shit. You know how I'm rock, and I'm ready for whatever. It's a big risk, man. Risk? What shipment we ain't had ain't been a risk? It's either gonna come with bullets or in handcuffs, man. Yeah, but our system cut 90% of that risk down. Bullshit, two days ain't enough time to set up shit. Man, what's that shit Pop used to say? When confused with a choice, go with what helps tomorrow, because That's where we headed. Facts. Shit, Pops ain't never led us wrong. You right about that. But tomorrow, let's figure out how to make this shit happen. Let's get it. We do this shit right, we can be bigger than the fucking mob ever was. Babe. We should go see that new movie that's out today. Which movie is that again? Deep Cover? No, I think the name of that movie was In Too Deep. - Where is- - Judging by the tail we put on her, she's meeting Marcus. But you need to be worrying about where she's gonna go. You know, I'll be honest with you. I'm highly disappointed in you. William Shephard, or what is it you calling yourself nowadays? Clarence. Since you've been on this case, you've given us nothing. Not one thread of the information that we can use on any one of the brothers. So since you can help us indict them, we're just gonna go to the next best thing. Oh, you act like you don't even know what she talking about. Kenya Thompson. It's all there in the folder. Distribution of narcotics. Mm-hm. - Conspiracy. - Mm-hm. Threatening a government agency. Oh and my favorite, the murder of Layla McKinney. Who? Keep looking. You may know her as Nicole. Ah, she didn't kill Nicole. See the fact that you didn't even acknowledge her being dead, but you were reacting to the girlfriend tells me everything I need to know. Look, you know how hard this say is pen, right? And you told me to get information on the brothers, not Kenya. Now if I get Kenya outta the way, how am I gonna get to the brothers? There's no other way, and you know that. I know you think I'm in too deep, and that's fine. But don't penalize me for being great at my job. Once I get something that can stick, you'll know I'm on your team. You have 24 hours to get us some valuable information. If not by the 25th hour, your precious little girlfriend will be on her way to a federal facility. Her son will be in a group home or wherever they send kids these days. And you, you might just find yourself behind bars with her. You know what, Will, I ain't gonna lie to you. I cannot help you this time, but you can help yourself. Get us something real solid. All of this go away. Come on, Kim. Let's go get something for lunch. Fuck. ♪ I'm legacy ♪ ♪ Niggas switched on who I started with ♪ ♪ But things changed ♪ ♪ Bloody niggas knew my heart ♪ ♪ But they don't feel the same ♪ ♪ Getting dark, it's getting harder to conceal the pain ♪ What's up nigga, you gonna answer the door? ♪ Switch on the glick ♪ New ass niggas. ♪ I hope this music make a way for me ♪ ♪ If they wanna hear my story gotta pray for me ♪ What's up, I got the text? Everything okay? Yeah, everything good. I was just making sure you good. I'm good. All right, well look I got some people waiting on me. I'll me back up with you later. All right. You here to trap or make love, nigga? Man, mind your business, man. Hey bro, for real. I think they got some top secret shit going on, you hear me. Shit, gotta be. Why you say that? 'Cause all them niggas pull up at the same time? Man, that shit don't go, bro. What you think going on? You ask a lot of questions, nigga. You feel it. Nigga, we don't get paid to ask no questions on what. Fuck we get paid for then? In a minute you gonna find out. For shit sure. Fighting broke out overnight between rival factions along the Israeli Syrian border. Hey, baby. I am so, so, so tired. And 13 civilians. How was your day? Boring as shit. Reported to have made it back to their headquarters. What did you do? Nothing. Just did a bunch of drop offs and pickups all day. That's it? Yep. You should be happy. Did I told you the deeper you get into this harder it is to get out. Like quicksand. What? Nothing. Anything worth mentioning? Yeah, but I gotta question first. Animal rights activists have been pushing for- If I asked you, drop everything and run away and start a new life with me? What about your son? About that. So I spoke with Marcus today. He told me after I do this last drop with him, then I'll be able to get my son. Last drop. Dang, all these questions. But you know what, they don't even matter. He wants me to run a decoy shipment with him. Decoy shipment? Was out for three hours in Eastern Metro because of down- He said we were gonna do a drop and sit and wait. No injuries were reported. Cleanup is expected to take at least two days. Then after that I'm done, completely done. And there was another drive by shooting today downtown. I can only get my hands on like 50 Gs though. It's something. Unconscious but expected to recover fully and should be able to help with- What? I've been saving this for about three years. How much is this? About 2.2. Million? Look, we can take this money, start a new life. Hell, I can even put my baby in private school. And make more babies. Ooh. Come here. Chances are we're in for another riot tomorrow. The benefits of laughter. It's no secret that... Clarence, we figured you see things our way. What you got for us? Not much really. But it might be something. It's gonna have to be, because it's the best I've got. There's gonna be a decoy shipment going out tomorrow. Are you kidding me? A decoy load? He's a fucking waste of time. Hey. And think about it. Why would they go through all that trouble with the decoy load unless they didn't want to get caught with the real thing? Continue. So the decoy load is meant to send you in the other direction of the real shipment. So all you have to do is figure out which one is the decoy load. So you know who the decoy is. All right. But you gotta promise me that you won't put charges on Kenya. Done. We never cared about her anyway. We just needed you to do your job. You know what? Hold on one second. Everything's gonna be just fine, if you can stop this load. Kenya will be exonerated of all charges predated from today. Kenya and Marcus are gonna be in the decoy truck. Now, I don't know where the real one is going, but I know it's not going be with them. You better hope this checks out. Go ahead. We got movement. You see what I see? Kenya and Marcus. We gonna catch them red handed. We got 'em. 911, what's your emergency? Oh my god, oh my god. I just saw a man force a white woman into a car. Have you been harmed? Are you okay? Uh-huh, uh-huh.
