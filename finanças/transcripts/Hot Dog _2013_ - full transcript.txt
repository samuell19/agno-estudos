Are you in Toronto? No. I took the 3pm flight. You didn't call. no good news? Actually. we didn't get the contract. The Toronto guys don't want our sausage. I know why. They know we're beating them. When are you coming? I'm taking the day off. I need to digest this. OK. See you Monday. OK. See you. Oh. Richard... Don't tell Conrad we didn't get it. I'II tell him. Don't worry. Have a good weekend. OK. Bye. Yes. Richard? And? - He didn't get the contract. - I knew it. It was the last straw. Is he coming? So I can tell him he's fired. No. He took the day off. It's better like that. He doesn't need more bad news. He was upset on the phone. I'd rather tell him right away. It would be a relief. I'd have a better weekend. I'm shocked. After all those years. I'm shocked. Annoying bastard. I'm not telling him he's fired. I'II do it. Get the paperwork ready so he can sign Monday. We'II be rid of him. To you. jackasses. What are we drinking to? To your future job. - Am I missing something? - No. Is it bad I don't have a job? You think I'm kind of a loser. Just a little? What do your friends say? ''Why are you with a loser?'' But I told them you're a good lay. That's priceless. I like that. Even if it's not true. I like it. I've been a househusband for 3 months now. and you know. I don't know why women fought for years to be able to work. I love staying home. I'II beat you. A battered househusband. that'II cost you. my dear. You're costing me. - Do you want a main course? - It depends. You're paying? Pizza Caprese. I've gotta pee. Who are you? - Who sent you? - I can't hear. It's OK. You saved my life. Massino... never forgets an enemy. Or a friend. We'II meet again. Madame. Don Massino. with all due respect? I know. You always give the same song and dance. ''We have to protect you. It's for your good. ''For your protection...'' I get it. but I'm sick of it. You're sick of it? Yes. Loretta. I am. Just a little. I'm scared. I'm scared. too. I'm scared for you. Everyone's afraid of something. OK. Don't listen. Go back to work. protect me like Loretta wants. Happy? Oh. and one more thing. Find me the guy who saved me. I want to know his name. who he lives with. who he works for. what he eats. what he drinks? I want to know it all. - Why are you laughing? - You should have seen when the cops asked: ''Were you close to the godfather Massino?'' And you? Your awesome answer. ''Uh. can you repeat that?'' - I almost laughed out loud. - I didn't expect that. What would you do if you knew he was in the mafia? - The same thing. - Save a murderer? - Yes. - I don't know. You don't know? Imagine it's your boss. you'd like to tear his head off. he starts choking at lunch. What do you do? You have a golden chance to watch him die. What do you do? You save him. It's not your boss you're saving. but life. And that's what I did. I protected life. Not on purpose? but? I did. You're OK. You've got no future. but I love you. Me. too. You must be starving. You were hungry before. We didn't have time to eat. What's in the fridge? I can make you my Michigan hot dogs. - Aren't you sick of those? - Not yet. Racquetball's great. Only you could make me work on Sunday. Bon. OK. 2 choices. 1. I screw in a new tooth. it takes 6 months to heal. ''6 months''? Forget it. Or I give you a bridge. - Does it look ridiculous? - No. They're common. Sorry. I didn't forget. Be there at noon. I have a meeting. Uh. hold on. - Noon? - You'II be out then. OK. Crazy for Crepes - Creperie You didn't eat your fruit. I'II make you a deal. Let me guess. You want to exchange your fruit for my bacon. It's a good deal. And healthy for you. I'II give you half my bacon for half the fruit. Last offer. Take it or leave it. If I refuse? I'II tickle you to death. Give me your bacon. Give me your fruit. What's in your teeth? Nothing. You don't want sausage? I'm done with sausage. I need a change. What's a godfather? Like Uncle Gilbert? It's also a mafia boss. What's the mafia? Organized crime. What's organized crime? They're like me. they sell things. but their stuff is illegal. and they use violence to help their business. Could you be in that business? No. no. honey. I'm too well-behaved. Do you know why you're here? I'd be lying if I said no. When you were in Toronto. something bad happened. Very bad. What happened? Well... Gilles and I? we had a bit of an altercation ''An altercation''... They fought behind the desk. I separated them. Gilles? Yes. Our own partner jumped on me. I couldn't even breathe. No one had ever hit me before. The 1 st and last time. He could have killed me. Gilles? We had to make a decision without your input. I hope you understand. Uh... Understand what? Well. I? We decided to fire Gilles and you're OK. We bought his 250/o share. it's 500.OOO dollars. You just have to sign. You could have told me. We wanted to talk in person. Pick up a damn phone and call. It's too important. We didn't want to distract you. What would change if we called you? Some things? I knew it. he disagrees. He's in shock. Let him digest it. I'm in shock. You fired Gilles. Is it permanent? No second shot? Who will handle R and D? Gilles was in charge of new products. ''New products''. We've made the same sausage 25 years. Gilles didn't have ideas. It's funny. When he showed you a new product. you rejected it. He said you had no vision. Me? I have no vision? Gilles. the great visionary? Let's not get into that. guys. Hold on. For a long time. I haven't bothered you with his crap. You know his last invention? The dog-burger. What? The dog-burger. It was a hot dog shaped like a burger. He must've had more ideas. No. Here it gets interesting. That was phase 1 of a trilogy. This summer he wanted to break more ground. Are you wondering what's better a hot dog hamburger? Ready? Ground beef shaped like a sausage. Oh. yeah. Turning a hamburger into a hot dog. Great. huh? You think he did nothing. just sit around for 1 5 years. Oh. no. The ideas machine was running on steam. Last week I told him: ''Enough.'' He took it bad. And to answer you. it's permanent. 500.OOO? That's not much. 250/o of the company is worth more than that. That's the other thing. We got the latest quarterly report. That's not bad. Turn the page. We're in the red. Why didn't you say? Did I know? We haven't stopped making sausages. Is the truck empty? It's too late once you know. We just found out. The good news is we can give Gilles less. Great news! Do you see why Toronto was important? If you'd told me I would have vomited on them. OK. Guys? We're the company. We have 2 quarters to turn it around. So no broken packages. no late orders. Iess spelling errors on the labels. No contract. To you. jackasses. No spelling mistakes... You picked a good time to fire me. The company's worthless. Why do I have to go? Huh? Why not Conrad? After 1 5 years of loyal service this. I don't accept it. You conspired against me. I'II get revenge. Hold up. ''Conspired''? You tried to strangle him. At least he didn't file a complaint. He could have. Move on. Think of yourself. You've worked there for 1 5 years. 5 days a week 1 O hours a day. You have no wife. kids. You have no life. Embrace it. Go on a trip. Visit Easter Island. How many times did you tell us? Aliens put the statues there for a landing strip. Go enjoy it. Live life. Most importantly put your pride and ego aside. It's not worth it. Believe me. It wasn't aliens. - Huh? - Forget it. Chile - Easter Island Here. Show this at the window. They'II give you a ticket to Easter Island. Bon voyage. Dorval Airport. Have a nice life. A hot dog with bite He signed. AII set. If that's from us. we're fucked. We know who it was. our ship is sinking. Who was it? Who do you think? Gilles. Gilles? But why? For revenge. He clearly said he was biting mad. He didn't say that. Even so. I know it was him. He never allowed cameras in the factory. I know him better. He wouldn't do that. An asshole did it. A jerk. a moron. Gilles. We'II sue him for trying to tarnish our image. sabotage... No. Calm down. We have no proof it was him. And if it were him or an employee or you. or you. or me. the problem isn't who put the tooth in the machine. it's the guy who found the tooth. You're right. We can't tell the press ''We know it's Gilles Langevin. ''You can eat your hot dogs in peace. We fired him.'' I doubt that would fix things. In any case my shares are going cheap if you're interested. Did the newspaper name anyone? Francois Pigeon. Pigeon must have called them to make money. Really? No. Surprisingly he has no intentions of suing anyone. He wants to return the package with the tooth to the company. Absurd. - Did he mention the company? - No. He's a professional. An amateur would have revealed the name and sued us. He's not going to court. He wants an undisclosed sum. He knows we don't want our name out there. Got us by the balls. This is going to cost a fortune. We don't know it's us yet. Even so. We have to assume it was us. OK... I'II repeat. my shares are for sale. For 1 5 years. we've worked for one thing: the best sausage. However it happened. we'II get through it. I don't care. I'II sell my car. my house. my cabin. live on the street. but Saucibec is what counts. Philippe. I'm moved by this. but there's nothing you can do. That guy's going to pay. it'II be a professional job. So what do we do? We'II find him. Francois Pigeon. make an offer he can't refuse. Only if it's us. Of course. Call the secret service. Ginette. at reception. What is this? trailer? He inherited it from his grandma. I don't know how they live there. Tony. don't repeat this to anyone. especially Loretta. or we'II hear about it for a month. She won't shut up. What happened that day was a miracle from the Madonna. While you were eying the waitress.. - ''Waitress''? It was a waiter. To each his own. I'm joking. Don't get upset. Every miracle deserves compensation. I'II go to church personally to thank the Madonna. I'II light a candle. You'II thank the Madonna? You don't know her. The only time you went to church was for your baptism. It's true. eh? I know you don't believe it. One day you'II grow up and believe. Now who did the miracle? Fran?ois? Who helped him perform this miracle? The Madonna. Only she performs miracles. ''The Madonna''? Hi. Hi. honey. You're working overtime? Remember we bought cretons at the Atwater market. Iast winter? No. I don't recall. It was in the back. Behind the soy sauce. Maybe it's still good. At first I thought it was a dead rat. It had a layer of white fur. Spare me the details. Did you do the freezer? You didn't send it. I've thought. I'm not sending the package to Saucibec. Think about it. What will happen when the tooth gets to the CEO's office? The general manager will get yelled at. Then he'II yell at the supervisor. who will yell at the poor factory workers. who have families. and who go home afraid of losing their job. They'II stress out their kids. who won't concentrate at school. they'II fail. It will have a repercussion on their life. AII over a tooth. Remember why you contacted the press. To scare sausage factories. To make them think before sending the tooth. If you don't send it. it falls apart. No. I disagree. OK. Saucibec won't know it was them. but they'II be afraid for their lives for 2 days. They'II be more careful. Can I ask you something very important? I never want you to buy sausages. - Too late. - You bought more? - What kind? - Saucibec. What do you want? I love them. And they were on sale. Why did you let a stranger over? He had something important to tell me. Life is funny sometimes. You're in the middle of an international crisis. open heart surgery. or a big date. when you have to shit. so the world stops. I think we're acquainted. No more filters. you can fart. We know what you feel. I love folks like you. - OK. Sonia? - Just fine. But like I was saying. I read the news article and thought: ''This will hurt Saucibec.'' Couldn't you shut your big mouth? Great. I haven't said anything. But I'm impressed. Not naming the company. Pretending you'II send the package to those clowns. It's genius. You should be happy to have a brain like that. Listen... It's nice to think that. but it's not our goal. That said. we're not dumb. We could have sued the company but? we aren't scammers. AIso. Saucibec. is a local company. founded and run by four Quebeckers. Three. Three. Whatever. We'd feel bad making money off them. And we don't want to make anyone Iose their job. That's it. The good little Christian who did without. with 20th century values. Are you afraid of hurting someone? What are the chances a tooth winds up in a sausage? You don't get it. God gave you a hand. My role is to share a message. You're a messenger of God? Don't exaggerate. More like God's bike courrier. I learned something recently. In life. it's each man for himself. Let the rest eat shit. Hockey is the best example. You know. each year. presidents of the national Ieague clubs meet and decide who will win the next Stanley Cup? Whatever. Do you watch hockey? In 1 995. an informant told Patrick Roy the Stanley Cup would go to the Quebec Nordics and the Canadians wouldn't get it for a long time. Wasn't he right? Patrick wasn't in a good mood. He threatened the league that if the Nordics didn't win it. he'd tell the press. That's it. No. no. I think I heard about this at work. What work? Touch?. Of course the owners freaked out. understandably. So they ordered Patrick's transfer to the Nordics. It didn't work because of Quebec-Montreal rivalry. but a few days later. the Nordics were sold to Colorado. Patrick was transferred and won the Stanley Cup. The moral of the story is Patrick put himself first. You see? We still love Patrick. Of course. My proposal is simple. You'II make a lot of money. without a trial. an attorney. or court. no bullshit. AII I ask in exchange is: you call the press and destroy Saucibec. so I can crush them for once and for all. Well? It's hard to have principles with 50.OOO dollars. Fuck your principles. They shouldn't put a tooth in their sausage. Saucibec never came to offer us compensation. Even if the poor families Iose their jobs. won't you regret it? - No. They'II do what I did. Find a new job. And the kids? They'II learn what poverty is. It'II make them stronger. No. it's positive. What's this? A gift for a friend. What friend? Francois. Francois who? He diverted the bullet. You're giving him a car? It's the least I can do. Life is worth more than a car. You were crazy but you're getting worse. You think I'm crazy? And you? You're normal? to still be with me. It's a nice gift. I want to take it to him personally. Alone. Alone. no. You're not going out. Ask Tony. Get it? Get it? I get it. I get it. Come to bed. I have a gift for you. too. Coffee and I don't get along. Do you plan to sue Saucibec? I didn't say anything. I swear. How do you know it was Saucibec? Well played. Now he knows. It was a Saucibec partner getting revenge. I think I know who. Listen. To answer your question. we have no intention of suing the company. I knew there were still generous people. Not just people who are out for money. Listen? Sincerely. on my behalf and that of the whole team. thank you. You're generous with Saucibec. Saucibec is generous with you. Ready? Saucibec is offering you a car worth 30.OOO dollars. it will be here tomorrow. AII you have to do is put in gas. Don't thank me. It's the least we can do. Wow. It's... That's very nice of Saucibec. but there's just one thing? we had a better offer. Much better. You're kidding. There's no offer. I know it. You're trying to drive up the price. I wasn't born yesterday. Incredible. But I'm not surprised. Who else would do this? - I'm surprised. - You are? He put a tooth in a sausage and 2 Good Samaritans ruin it. He pays them to change their mind. No. Guys. all companies must end. We're at the end. It's a declaration of war against Saucibec. He overstepped. He wants revenge and he won't stop till we're ruined. It's just the beginning. It'II get worse. I know him. No. We have to stop the bleeding so we have to act now. and act fast. We'II get rid of him. Get rid of him? - Get rid of. it's? - No. Kidnapping. ''Kidnapping.'' We won't hurt him. We'II shut him up 2 days. so he thinks it over and calms down. During that time. we make a deal. So. we're kidnapping him? Wow! Great idea. Conrad. get some garbage bags. You take care of the ties. Done. Are you insane? No. no. Know what? I'II give you my shares. I'II take them. Are you coming? Richard. coming or not? I thought Gilles was the only crazy one here. He's not. Where can you find a kidnapping specialist? Ginette. at reception. Some advice. AIways close the patio door. I was in my patio. Can we talk somewhere quiet? My daughter's bedroom. Perfect. See you in 30 seconds. Nice floor. That's not easy. Nope. So a kidnapping for 7 to 1 O days. housing. food. - Yes. - No torture. abusive use of force or mutilation. That's very important to us. Have a photo? We're talking? 1 8.547. That's expensive. No offense. I feel like you're taking advantage of me. Don't insult me. It's expensive because it's harder to not hurt him. It's 300/o more. And there's food. My hostages eat like in a 5-star hotel. I have all fresh. organic food. all you can eat. If I can't pay that. is there... a 2-star package? Unfortunately. no. Come on. you can do better. 8 x 8. 64. No less. My best price. 1 3.254. How did you get that figure? What's the calculation? My operation fees. I'm not the cheapest. But I won't screw up. You'II sleep at night. Give me a price and I'II make a recommendation. Here's the regulars' price. I hardly do this. You have 2 seconds to decide. There's a proposal! Sold. How do we do it? Do you take company checks? What do you think? You're so organized. I thought... Here's my account number. If there's no money at 1 1 tomorrow. we're done. I'II call you when it's done. Tony. I thought the fit for Fran?ois... The car. it's not enough. I had an idea. - More? - Yes. Rehab his house. - Just the outside? - The whole thing. in and out. That house is shit. Exactly. Tony. because it's shit. Boom. shit! No more shit! You have one week. - I've got architect plans. - Plans? Yes. It's not enough time. What? Tony. you're joking. And last year? You built a bunker in 6 days with walls like a prison. It was different. It was an emergency. Wasn't Francois saving me serious? It's not what? Give me a week. I'II do the work. There you go. I knew it. Listen. Tonight we dine and relax. Tomorrow. you go to the travel agency. To buy 2 tickets. Talk to Julio. 2 tickets to Mexico. First class. For Francois and his wife. They're going to Mexico. To my villa. Listen. Gilles. we called because we changed our mind. The truth is... Saucibec made an offer we can't refuse. It's not about money. We never wanted to ruin Saucibec's image. Well its' money. too. How much? 50 and a _30.OOO car. When you think about it. 3 things control everything in life. Power. sex. and money. But really one thing controls it all. Money. With money you bed who you want and you have power. You. Fran?ois. are proof of that. You personify the pathetic people who won't let the world change. But Gilles. don't take it personally. You're fighting a sausage giant. It's David vs. Goliath. Gilles. before you rip up that check. think hard. I have an offer for 50.OOO plus a car. What will you give me if I refuse? So I move my ass and run to the press? Your offer should be impressive. See what I'm saying? Sonia. I can't feel my hand. can you let go? I can't. I'm overexcited! 1 50.OOO dollars! I'm so excited! It's not over. We won't turn that down. OK. Listen close. You'II tell Saucibec we have a check for 1 50.OOO dollars! We can negotiate up to. say. 1 25.OOO. Come on. 1 35.OOO. So excited! I know you're lying. You moved your eyebrow. You don't know me. That's when I tell the truth. They say: ''No news is good news.'' No worries. We've got a pro. You're negative. Why do I associate with someone like you? Opposites attract. Slaves' work! And you're racist. No. my mom said that. - Do you prefer shit work? - Yes. I do. Hello? Florence? Uh... Florence is in the bathroom. she'II call back. Shit! I'm sorry. It won't happen again. I promise. You said that last week. Can you do me a favor? I told your mom you were in the bathroom. Hello? It hung up. What? I heard: ''It's done'' and it hung up. Must be a wrong number. Let's go. To apologize I want you to make filet mignon. If you want. I'm your chef tonight. I also want a chocolate banana split. You won't sleep. - That's your problem. - You're right. You'II be here a while. We'II try to keep some hygiene. I doubt you have a change of clothes. I'II remove the gag. but if you yell. it's the cold room. I warn you. it's boring. Or else you can watch TV. I have cable. How's this? On the menu tonight? Vegetarian lasagne. Just raw vegetables. And no pasta. It's fine layers of zucchini. How do you like the ricotta cheese? It's not ricotta. It's macadamia nuts you ground up with lemon juice. Gills is no idiot. And yet here I am. I try to cook raw organic food. It's a new thing. I have digestive issues. Maybe it's age. I get gassy when I eat. It's not that your digestive issues aren't fascinating. but I don't give a shit. Give me my checkbook. I'II give you 1 O times what Saucibec paid. 1 5! 20! 25! A check for 1 50.OOO? He's crazier than I thought. I imagine you want more. No. We're open to negotiation. Listen. Philippe. we're putting the cards on the table. We showed up 1 O minutes after Gilles left. I thought it was you. No. It was an attorney specialized in sausage. I asked him his name. but he said nothing. But he doesn't like Saucibec either. Basically. he said with our file he could get 250.OOO or 300.OOO. easy. And he's really motivated. He covers all the lawsuit fees. When he said that we were surprised. Yes. Well. I was surprised. Yes. and we thought: ''What do we do with this?'' You said: ''What do we do with this?'' And we thought. courts. attorneys. all that? forget it.. And Gilles... We forget him. 200.OOO dollars and we never speak again. We'II see you in court. What did you do? Impossible. Our plan was fool-proof. You're such an idiot. To buy back your mistake... Call Gilles and ask for a new check. - Am I clear? - Yes. honey. You're the worst liar I know. Hello. it's Gilles Langevin. Leave a message. Hey. Gilles. it's Francois. Listen. I put my jeans in the washer and the check was in the pocket? Could you bring me another? Same amount. No change. See you. Bye. He'II call back. We're dealing with a compulsive liar. Now he says there's a lawyer working for the competition. I give up. You handle it. I'm done. Are you joking. I think I know who it is. What? 2 days ago. Michel. from Lauridel. called my office. What did you say? He wanted to know? He didn't get the sausages and wanted to know if we got them. I said ''No''. Give me that. But I said: ''Don't worry. we're handling it.'' No? I didn't now he would figure it was us. I'm sure it's Michel. Of course. He's a lawyer. We've taken his market share for years. He wants us to fail. I feel like we're digging our grave. If we kidnapped one more we could get a deal. Call your guy. - Boss? - Don't panic. Keep watching TV. I just went to deliver my gift. Hey! Important: Don't tell Loretta. OK. Get me in 20 min at Francois' house. Call when you're here. Great. Yes. Yes. OK. Hello. It's Gilles Langevin. Leave me a message. Gilles... I've left you 6 messages. I'm disappointed. I don't know what you're up to. But I'm disappointed. Honey? Saucibec gave in! My strategy worked. What's this? Probably the car they promised. The 200.OOO are coming. If they believed you. they're really dumb. Call Saucibec right away and say we'II take their offer. Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. He's waking up. Hi... I'm Gilles. Were you the bassist in Kiss? I'II remove the Scotch. If you yell. I'II lock you up the cold room. Believe me. he'II do it. Understand? I'm looking at you? You look like the Godfather. What's his name? Passimo? Passimi? Do you want the Scotch back? Yeah? I know I fucked up at the restaurant. What do you want? If you're interested in Massino. I can deliver him alive. tonight. to make it up. Are you kidding? Sorry again. Listen. Jimmy. The last time I wasn't clear. So I'II repeat it one last time. You're an incompetent. has-been hit man. I don't work with losers. If you call again I'II put a prize on your head. Am I clear? No answer. I don't see him. There's no problem. He's in the bathroom. He takes his time. Isn't it quiet for people who just got a car? - OK. I'II look. - No. no. Don't move. I see. Who's that? The brains of the operation. The guy gave him a check. You're hurting my hand. I know. I can't stop. I have a check for 200.OOO dollars! - Where'd he go? - I'm calling the cops. What will you tell them? We just blackmailed a guy and he was kidnapped? If you want to go to jail. that's a solid story. What do we do? AII we do is manage crises between beige walls. You're right. We'II repaint. - Yes? - They took Philippe. - Who's this? - Francois. with the tooth. Who took him? A guy got out of a car with a machine gun and took him. ''Machine gun''? Philippe was kidnapped. - What did the guy look like? - Mad. I didn't now what to do. I called you first. Not the cops. Francois. shut up. And disappear. Yes. perfect. Great idea. Good luck. guys. and thanks again for the check. Bye. We did what we had to. Now it's their problem. We went too far. Lauridel's revenge. They know we kidnapped Michel. I told you! I knew these kidnappings would end bad. OK. What do we do? Conrad! Conrad! - I'm thinking! - We've got 2 choices: We call Lauridel or wait for them. Let me think! Let me think! Who do you work for? Saucibec. You're kidding. Who's your boss? I'm Richard's and Conrad's partner at Saucibec. Shit! It's true. He's VP at Saucibec. What's this? A cover to launder money? Calm down. it's a misunderstanding. I know Lauridel hired you. Right? ''Lauridel''? What's Lauridel? Lauridel is another sausage and hot dog company. Do we have a contact there? I don't think so. Maybe Michel? Who's he? I don't know. I've had enough. Who's your guy? My guy... Shit! It's Philippe. Yes. Philippe? Listen to me. Who's this? Doesn't matter. No time for that. I bring your guy and you bring the godfather. Got it? I don't know what this is. but the Italian mafioso accent doesn't work on me. Can you repeat that? You heard me. You're not talking to Lauridel. - What? - It's not Lauridel. This isn't Lauridel. Wait. I have to listen to my remaining partner. You must have an agreement with him. What's funny? Nothing. You realize we kidnapped the mafia godfather? Stop laughing. I can't. Please. stop. This is serious. OK. If it's true. the kidnapper we hired should have told us! Hope it's not that. stop laughing. OK. Settled. When and where? What are you doing? It's my grandpa's 1 2. It fed 3 generations. It still works. - Are we doing that? - This is serious. We kidnapped Quebec's most dangerous mobster. It might go bad. I'm not taking the risk. - How's this? - OK. Ah. here? You can finish the job you started. You want to know who hired me to kill you? You want to settle scores and clean house?
