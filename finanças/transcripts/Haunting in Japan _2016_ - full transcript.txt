Let me ask you seriously. Have you seen any ghosts before? If you haven't, do you believe there are ghosts? For me, I never believed it. Until one day, my friends and I happened to stay in this rental house. Oscar Lodge. This place... will make you forget everything you've heard about ghosts. It won't be what you think or have heard. This place is twisted. It is abnormal. There's no pattern, no direction... in taking revenge. There's only a knife. A knife in her hand. A knife that could kill you any second. This friend of mine is Nak. Right. Nak Charlie. I've known him since we were young. We did a film together. Yeah, our first and only hit. Now he is a singer, just like his dream. Nak is a gifted person. He plays his own guitar. Sings and writes his own songs. All of his songs are about a thing I've never seen. Love. The love he found in this house. The love that he told me... was real love. Someone told me that real love and ghosts have one thing in common. So many people talk about them, but so few have really met them. Nak must be lucky. He met real love and a ghost... at the same time. Mom always told me... that love is the most valuable thing for women. Love keeps us alive with hope. Hope makes us value life. So, for a woman to give her love to someone is just like giving her life to that person. Yesterday was my 20th birthday. It was the day I decided to give my life to the one I loved. A warm person, who had been raised in a perfect family. So perfect that I forgot about the thing my mom had always told me. "Before you love someone, you must know if that person spells the word 'love' with his heart, or another organ." Mac. Don't stop. Oh, don't stop! Mac. Mac. Don't stop. -Mac. -Rose. Mac. Tell her why you stopped. -Hey, you. -Lilly, stop it. I won't stop. I'm not afraid of you. My dad is a cop. Your dad is a cop? Yes. My name is Jack. Yes. Jack from My Girl. Ong! I have something to tell you. But my story is about life and death. Actually, three dead, and one in a coma. It happened in Japan. My friend Nak was releasing his single. So, I offered to make an MV for him. The location I chose was a rental home in Niseko. We decided to rent a house called Oscar Lodge because the rent was so cheap. So cheap that I didn't care about the ghost stories posted online. Let me ask you, Nay. The ghosts they talk about... Have you really seen them? I've never seen them. Many people who saw them wrote about it on the Internet, so nobody dared to come here. Hasn't the monk arrived yet? Not yet. It's been almost an hour. The holy dolls we brought, they were all rejected. What should we do? Give me another glass of beer. What about the holy dolls? Forget it. You have had several glasses. Aren't you drunk already? I'm not drunk. Japanese beer is so weak. Try a sake bomb, then. -"Sake bomb"? -That's right. What the hell are you doing? Again? Why don't you just pour the sake? To save time. To save the chopsticks. Ugh. Make it quick. Oh, well. How is that? Oh, shit. Sake bomb. You're Nay, right? Be blessed. Get up. That ice must be very cold. OK. Was it much trouble for you to come here, Venerable Nenkham? Not at all. A follower of mine has given me a private jet, so it's very convenient to travel anywhere. And this request was from your mother, so no matter how hard or how far, I of course had to come. I really appreciate it. Is this your troubled rental home? Yes, this is the one. It's quiet. No one has dared to rent it even in peak season. It can't be good if it continues like this. Don't worry. Wait here. Don't go inside. OK. I told you not to drink too much. Shit. The beer is not the problem. It's that sake bomb you gave me, bastard. What is it? Nothing. Is there anything wrong with him? Well, he... he had... So, you want to play with me? You'll see me soon. This house is so badly possessed. So bad that I had to puke. Really? So, what they wrote on the Internet is true? Did you see me puke? It's a million percent true. Wait for me here. Wait until I'm done. Then you can enter. Koy. Normally, he doesn't forbid anyone. I think you'd better wait here. Please, venerable one. Nay, look what it did to me. You evil spirit. Are you all right? Ugh! Don't ever give me a sake bomb again. Give me a cure for my hangover. Don't you know that I'm working? Is this the time and place for that? Take it back. Damn it. This is not a good time. Close the curtain. Why? So Nay can't see us. What should we do next? Kham, have you ever seen a ghost? To tell the truth, I've never seen one. What about the sound of the cutter and that drawing? We'd better leave. No. It's too soon. What's that? So obvious. I think we should leave now. Hey, how can we leave? If we leave now, he'll know. I have built my reputation up for a long time. OK? Just a little longer. I'll go to the toilet. Hey, how do you know the toilet is that way? Come back quickly. Koy. Koy! Hey. You want a piece of me? I've learned from the master. Not done. Not done? Not done, huh? -Kham. -Koy. What happened to your face? Do not tell me... I hereby am paying homage to the Buddha. Asshole. They are Japanese ghosts. How could they understand you? -Arigato. -Arigato. Gozaimasu. Arigato. What is she doing? -She wants the knife back. -No. If you get the knife, you'll surely stab me. You can't. No. You'd better give her the knife. I think it's too late. Why? It's already in her hand. Where's the knife in my hand? Ow! Koy! Wait for me. Drive! Quick! I'm in Japan, Mom. I came to ski. I want to try something new. Perhaps it can help me forget something that happened in Thailand. Yes, Mom. Sister. How can I get out of here? There's no way out. No way out? What is this place? It's a prison. A prison? A prison for the dead. Am I dead? I don't know. Try searching on Google. Hurry here. Love awaits. You want it this way? What way? Love awaits. Shit. Those "seven years" types like you don't understand. "Seven years"? Seven years of whores. You sound like you never done it with a whore. Yes, but not all seven years like you. One whore for seven years. Why don't you marry her already? That would be a very selfish thing to do. How is it selfish? -I'd get to keep her to myself. -Right. But no one else could have her. How can others have her if she's married to you? Yeah, that's what people call selfish. Only a lowlife like you could say something like that seriously. This house has five bedrooms. One downstairs. Four upstairs. But you can only use three. One is being repaired. What about Wi-Fi? Username is "Oscar Lodge." No password required. Here is the key. Uh, what about the car key? Oh, sorry. Here's the car key. Shit. Is it blurry? So, today we are here in Japan. We came to shoot an MV. Let me introduce the members. This is Get. Get is the art director. This is Ong. He likes to get massages. He's the cameraman. This guy's Aof. He's the manager. He takes care of us. Feeds us. Yok. Stand up. -You're out of the frame. -No head. Shit. Can you see his head? He's the tallest of the group. The boom man. And my friend right here is the lead singer. Listen to him now. I'm right here waiting for your return Waiting and searching all the time -Yes, sir? -Is someone squeezing your throat? I'm the director. Let's tell social media about it. The tone of this MV is an artistic style. Indie plus art film. Something like that. Do you know that I love you so much? I told you, but you never told me Your feelings We have been far apart since you left me Hey, Nak. Jack is going out to see the location. He asked if you want to see it, too. Can I not go? I've seen it. But if you don't go, will they know where that location is? Get. What's wrong with you? There are ghosts in this house. What? Japanese ghosts. So you wrote something on your faces to repel them? Tell me about it. I'm going to take a shower. I'm going to chat with Muay. How are you doing, Muay? Why didn't you take my call? Have you packed your bags? Is your ticket confirmed? Nak. I can't go. Oh? Why not? Do you remember my dad? Uh huh, your dad, Pob. He didn't allow you to go? Then why'd he say you could go before? Hi, Dad. I'm not your dad. Most importantly, I'm not Muay's dad. I'm her husband. Shouldn't we go back to shoot the MV in Thailand. It's up to you. I know how you feel. So what, Nak? Love ends. So be it. But to end the work because of love is not right. Correct. I'm glad you think this way. I'll take you to buy a fake pussy. Thanks a lot, Jack. If you'd like a massage, go with Ong. If you'd like pussy, stay with me. That's an option. You guys help me a lot. If you still want to make an MV, where will you find the actress? Right. Muay will be with her dad. Husband. Same person. Stop the dad or hubby debate. I'll take care of the actress. What will you do? That stunned look on Rose's face when she first saw Nak made me think... ah, shit. There's trouble. Mac? My name is Nak, not Mac. I'm Jack. Oh, hi. I'm Rose. We've just arrived this morning. Are you also staying here? Right. Jack and Rose. Just like in Titanic. Impossible! How come they look alike? I'm gonna call him. Hey, what are you blaming him for? What if he kicks us out? Where are you going to stay? Good. I really don't want to stay. Exactly. Don't, Aof. I have an idea. Nak. Do you think that girl, Rose, can be your MV girl? I don't think she'll do it. If I can talk her into it, do you think she's a good fit? Nay, don't worry. This time it's real. Are you sure, Mom? You sent me a fake monk. I'm sure. That Nenkham was a fraud, I know. But this time it's for real. He is an avatar of Ganesha. More powerful than the monk. Have you looked on the Internet? I'm looking at it now. It's... Pick him up at the airport. Is he coming? Of course. Pick him up at the airport tomorrow morning. Oh, wait. Mom. Hello? Mom. He's been naked for a while now. The longer the better. Jack, this is an MV, not an indie film. It's been 20 years since I last came to Niseko. You have been here before, Master Chang? When I was young. Did you come to cleanse the spirit or fight the ghost? I came here to ski. Are you cold? It's minus eight. Why do you have to take off your shirt? The director wants it to be artistic. Hey. Don't turn around. I'm cold. Five more seconds. Ong. Keep the camera rolling. What kind of ghosts are possessing this house? I'm not sure, master. But the people who saw them told me they are Japanese ghosts, mother and son. You saw, right? How did Jack talk you into it? I wanted to do it. Why do you want to do it? Do you have time to listen? -Jack. -Don't turn around yet. -Is it artistic enough? -Five more seconds. -Son of a bitch. -Cut. From the eyes of a director, who saw Rose's eyes from afar, I could only say that... something was up. Master Chang. I'm not Chang. I'm Ganesha. Oh. Right. Lord Ganesha must have taken your body. I thought there were two. But I found eight more. You will have to pay a hundred thousand. I will pay. It's a lot of money. It's worth it. I'm not here to bother anyone. I never intended any harm. Arigato. Shit. You asshole ghost. I've had enough. -Hey. -Never seen anything like this. I'm going crazy! Where am I going? Hey, Ong. Do you think Rose likes Nak? If not, would they meet in private? Do I look like Mac? Very much. Can you take me to see him? I want to see someone who looks like me. I don't want to. Why? I've broken up with him. He was the meanest man I've ever known. So you came to stay here alone? I thought to myself... that skiing might make me forget. How long have you known Mac? Three years. It can't be forgotten in three days. If it's hard to forget, can I erase it instead? How do you erase it? You erase old memories by replacing them with new memories. What would be your new memory? You, Nak. I'm not a good person, am I? For what? Being a slut. Being easy. It wouldn't be good, if you are easy with men who are... Mean. Yes, mean. But I don't think there's anyone meaner than him. Would you stop this joke already? The writing on the face, it doesn't work. Just wash your faces, all of you. You, Nak, go find the girl. It's late. Rose. Does my pretty face have anything on it? I told you. It's group hallucination. Let's go to work. Jack. This is too long. What are you waiting for? Waiting for her mood. Rose. Jack wants yesterday's mood. Nak, where did you get the kimono? They got it from the house. You don't want to wear it, right? I think the ghosts that your friends saw are real. Why did you think that? At first, I thought I was dreaming. She saw the writing on your face. We told you, but you didn't listen. Hey, guys. She said she met the ghosts last night. I believed it then. Not only that. Rose also disappeared... in broad daylight. No one ever saw her again. All that was left was the passport she dropped. Miss Buppah Rahtree. Are you all right, Yok? Who forgot the key, asshole? Nak, do you see something at the door? Yok. I'm trying to fix it. Yok. What is it? Don't you want to get inside? I'm not going in. What's wrong with you guys? Friends, why don't you tell me honestly? Shit. Close the door. Jack. Look at the door. I saw something worse, bastard. What did you see? The ghosts putting powder on. It was scary. Are there two ghosts? I think there are three. -How can we get inside? -We go back to Thailand, dumbass. -What about the video? -Forget it. That mother and son hadn't paid their rent. When I went inside to move their belongings, I found their bodies. And you never told this to anyone? No one would believe me. Have you told this to a girl named Rose? Rose? Who is that? Rose, the girl who stays in the unfinished room. -I never let anyone rent that room. -Sure. She's a ghost. I wouldn't believe it either if I hadn't seen it myself. Can I go to the restroom? Sure. It's downstairs. Go down and turn right. She's my niece. She had an accident while skiing. She has been lying unconscious since then. But her mother will take her back tomorrow. What's the name of your niece? Galawan. From the eyes of a director, I didn't catch the look on Nak's face. But if I had, I would have said, ah, shit. How do we get inside to get our stuff? Hi, Unkuru. Everyone, this is Unkuru. He can help us get the stuff from that house. -He's an expert exorcist here. -Yes. I've been to Thailand. I love Thailand very much. I like Thai foods. I love Thailand. I've been to Thailand several times. Ah, shit. Something's up. -You guys, I have something to tell you. -Is it scary? If it's scary, you don't have to. Don't tell it yet. Look over there. Everyone, gather here. I can conclude that there are three souls inside. One is not scary. It's a lost soul. But it's under the power of the other two souls. These two souls are mother and son. When the mother was alive, she was mad. She killed her son and then herself. Freaking scary. Not scary. The ghosts are not scary. The scary thing is the knife. The ghost has a knife. What's the umbrella for? It's for opening, dumbass. I know it's for opening. But what for? So the ghosts can't see you. Why do we have to take of our clothes? The ghosts can see your clothes. Three umbrellas. Six people. So, two people for one umbrella. We can see the ghosts, but the ghosts can't see us. Hey, the umbrella works. Get our stuff and get out. Hey. Whose phone is that? Come down. Down. Did anyone leave a phone in here? Son of a bitch. This is not a haunting ghost. This is Line ghost. Don't worry. The soul is attached to a certain object. I don't have that object today. Oh, wow. Not only a Line ghost, but also a vacuum cleaner ghost. Jack. Shit. Asshole. Where's your umbrella? Can you drive, Nak? Hey! Wait. Shit. This is too much. What kind of ghost haunts during daytime? A Japanese ghost, asshole. It's you, Nak. It was your idea about the MV. We can do it in Thailand. So, it's my fault, huh? But what hurts is that Unkuru left me. You left me. Ong, you shouldn't remember things like that. It's annoying. Hey, Nak where are you going? I'm going to Nay's house. Why? You already got your stuff. Let's go home. Fly back to Bangkok now. Go to the airport. I need to go. Why? Shit, Nak. Jack, take a seat. Yeah. I can't stand anyway. She might be drugged with a sedative. Damn. This Nay guy is really a psycho. -I'm going back to that house. -Why do you want to return? I believe Rose's soul is still in that house. And she doesn't know that her body is here. You're the good guy, huh? I'm not going with you. I'm just a supporting actor. -I'm going with you, Nak. -There you go. -I'm going, too. -Another one. I'm going, too. I know. Shit. Let's all go. This is what I talked about. It is twisted. It is abnormal. No pattern, no direction. I don't know what she wanted. Come in. What are you waiting for, asshole? You said you wanted to come to help him. I didn't say that. I was about to say that I didn't want to go. Oh, and I stopped you, right? Right. Rose. Am I dead? You're not dead. Why am I here? You're not here. Your body is in Nay's house. Why is my body in Nay's house? I'll go to the toilet. Shit. She sings well. -What the hell are you playing? -Do you really want to know? Jack... Jack. -What's wrong? -Shit. Hey, can I leave this with you? Shit. Kept me waiting for a long time. Shit. That's too much. I've had enough. Get, what is it with you? At the door. What's wrong with you guys? What the hell is this? What did she say? She wants to use the toilet. Jack is in the toilet. The toilet is in use. I'm shitting. Unchi. Arigato. Can you understand that, asshole? Itai. Goddamn asshole. Okasan. Okasan. Oh, shit. Itai. Let's run. What about Aof? Whatever. Damn, you do love your friend. Oh, fuck! Why are you still sitting? Help me. How do you think I can help? Shit. Look! She's controlling me! Don't force it. You can't fight her. She's about to slash my throat. Shit. I'm tired. Damn it. Possess me already. The soul has moved to this house. Ong, start the car. Ong. You're going to call the cops for me, right? Actually, three dead, and one in a coma. How is Jack? He's better, but he still can't remember anything. Nak, if we get back together Would it be possible? Nothing is the same, Muay. I have to go now. See you later. Thanks for coming. After I got out of the hospital, I'd forgotten a lot of things. When did my memory return? I don't want to talk about it. I really don't want to remember it. Hello, right. It's Jackie. I'm the manager of Nak Charlie. Oh, wow. So cute. No. Nothing. I'm just looking at the view at Niseko. I'm in Niseko right now. The ski town. Do you know it, huh? Oh, the commercial? Can you send me the paper first? The contract. But it's going to be seven figures for sure. It's fine if you don't want to. I'll post a picture on Instagram. One picture. One day and I'll delete it. Damn, you are hot right now. Jack. Can't you remember that you came here once before? When did I come here, Nak? I was managing your work in Bangkok. And then we flew in here for work. I've never been here before. This is my first time. Nak went back to Oscar Lodge once again. He believed that if Rose's soul had not left the place, he would meet her there. I asked him if he would come back next year if he didn't see her. This house has five bedrooms. Three toilets. Twelve beds in total. Up to 12 people can stay here. How many people do you have? His answer made me realize something about love. Sometimes, love can't be explained with words. You must face it yourself. Rose. Nak. One more time. My voice caught. Continue. Action.
