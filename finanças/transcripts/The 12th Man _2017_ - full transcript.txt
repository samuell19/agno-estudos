Where's your commanding officer? I'm here to pick up the report from Lieutenant Jan Baalsrud. That's him. This is London. On days like these, many in Norway may wonder what the mood must be like in England. Are our nerves holding up, or are we becoming discouraged? Allow me to respond with full conviction. Our nerves are fine. Our morale is far from weakened. It only grows stronger with every passing day. Sigurd! Hey, on your knees. I said get on your knees. They haven't seen you yet. Make sure this wasn't all in vain. I'm only going to ask you this once, and I suggest you answer me honestly. What is your mission? - I don't know. Sir. What is this? - I don't know. - Oh, really? Hey, hey! Over there! Someone stop him! Hurry! Get him! He went this way! Footprints. Over there. - I don't see anything. He's gone. - Damn! Over there, move! Keep searching. Check everywhere. See anything? The water can't be more than zero degrees. He won't last very long. It's actually less than zero degrees, Colonel. - How so? - Because it's saltwater. Can you help me? Please. I'm not dangerous. I just need to get warm. Then I'll leave. If they come here, tell them I made you do it, that I threatened to kill you. They're looking for someone on Rebbenesoya. ' Yes. But the girls picked you up on Vaeroy. YES. So you swam from Rebbenesoya to Vaeroy? YES. What happened? I got shot. It's okay. I can barely even feel it. That's because you're frozen. Let me get you some dry clothes and boots. I'll also get you some wool socks and underwear. Stop, he's my son! I'm sorry. What's the quickest way to Tromso? Translate it. He's Norwegian. It's getting hard to keep our spirits up. - Come here! - Right. I suppose we have this gentleman to thank. What's your name? - Sorensen. - Sorensen? Excellent. This is good. It's very descriptive. Unfortunately, part of the document is illegible. Festung Norwegian There's not much Norwegian left. - 11? - Yes. There are 12 men. Where is the 12th one? Hm, well, the 12th one, we chased him into the fjord and he never resurfaced. I SEE. And where is his body? Hmm? It's like I told you, he never resurfaced. How long did you wait? No, it's not possible. That water is below freezing. And the ocean, well, it's the ocean. It is deep and wide. He was injured and bleeding. And yet you failed to catch him? Why are you here? Wenders. What are your ambitions in life? Have you seen this? Ambition is rewarded. In my entire career I've never lost a single person. I want you to search every house in the area. Focus on people with any type of medical knowledge. Got it? Like doctors, midwives. Herr Sturmbannfuhrer. I cannot emphasize it enough. The man is dead. And I'm telling you, that until we find his body, he's alive. No one's ever swum that strait, even in the summertime. Tromso is swarming with Germans. I still have to go. Are you trying to save the others? The ones you came with? YES. And the ones not captured. Are we close? We're almost there. What's going to happen? They'll just send us to a camp, right? Don't worry about it. I can't. It's impossible not to worry... - Would you just shut up already? - Hey, hey... that's not helping. Bjorn! It's okay to be afraid. And now it's your turn. No, he hasn't done anything! Leave the boy alone! No! Hey, hey! Right there. Thank you. All for Norway. All for Norway. Goodness, you startled me. Sorry. I heard your husband could maybe... No, he's not here right now. I'm sorry. Hey, hold on. You're not going anywhere until I look at that foot. There. That's the best I can do. You need a doctor. I have more urgent matters. Listen, if you get gangrene, nothing will be urgent anymore. If you see it turning red here, get to a hospital or you won't have many days left. Do you understand me? Where are you headed? I have to get to Tromso. I thought I'd cross over here. No, don't go that way. Instead, head over to the Hansens at Karanes. I delivered Margareth, their daughter. They're good people- Get out of here! Herr Wagner? She's a midwife. We're looking for a runaway soldier. Have you seen him? - No, I've seen nothing. - Our apologies, ma'am. Let's continue northward. Thank you for your help. Goodbye. Onward! - The briefcase? - It's been helpful. The documents inside mention Operation Martin Red. It was a plan to strike the control tower and seaplanes. Is there any news on the 12th man? Ah, no. But we found the names of the two local contacts here in Tromso. Bring them in, then. - Any news? - Be patient. I'm trying something new here. Hey! You're supposed to feel the pain. What a waste of time! Not that anyone cares what I think. HEY- Tell me where he is. Do I really need to remind you that Heinrich Himmler, Reichsfuhrer of the SS, is expecting a report from us? Exactly how long do you think he will remain patient? Herr Wenders, a man can easily survive 20 minutes in icy water. True, there may be hypothermia. But his heart will be beating. He will be able to move. His brain will still function. The 12th man is not dead. - Damn! - Drop it. Security Police! Open Up! Come on. He's too frail. Get me another. Get in! Farther! Farther! Go down! I need someone stronger than this. God damn it! Damn it. - Who the hell are you? - Don't shoot. Margareth, go inside. Who are you? Is this Karanes? The Germans claimed victory, said they caught all 12. There were 12 of you, right? ' Yes. I'm not stupid. I heard rumors. Something didn't make sense. So I asked them, if you caught all of them, then why are you still searching? Now I know why. Did they mention the others? No. I just heard they were caught. Most of them were imprisoned. A few are in the hospital. Ragnhild helps out at the hospital sometimes. She knows some of the nurses. ' And? I'll fill you in later. Are you a soldier? No, not exactly. I'm an instrument maker. Do you make pianos? No, not like that. I make the kind of instruments that you can use to draw a map. Make sense? I also draw maps. And one time... I rode my bike... from Sweden to Norway. so I could draw a map of an airport. But when I returned to Sweden, there was a policeman there who told me I was no longer allowed to draw maps. So I had to leave Sweden. Then I went to Russia, the Ukraine, Turkey, India, Kenya, South Africa. And then... I took a boat over to Brazil and went up to Trinidad, the United States, and Canada. And then I took another boat... to England. And finally I came to Shetland where I met my friends. And then I came here. Why didn't you go to Australia? You're good with geography. A bookworm. She loves geography. Farm work, not so much. Are you ready to go? You need to tell me what you know. All I know is what I heard at the hospital. Which is? There have been mass arrests in Tromso. And there are rumors that the Germans found your secret documents. And the men I came with? I heard about one man called... Sigurd. They say he was tortured to death. But another one, Erik Reichelt, is still alive. He's in the hospital. The others? They are being executed... tonight. Here you go. Wow. This is my entire life. I'm going to treasure this. What are you looking at? Do you think the Germans have stolen our northern lights? No, that's not possible. My mother said if you can see the northern lights, then you're never far from home. If you like the northern lights, you can always hide here with us. We have lots of northern lights and lots of good hiding places. ' MY God! What have they done to you? I didn't say anything. I didn't say anything! No, I believe you. I believe you. They haven't been able to find him. The man who was with all of you, they haven't found him. He's alive. He's still alive. _ My family, give them my best. Please. I need to go. How can I help save our country if I just stay here in hiding? Are you going to Tromso? No, it's too late. I'm going to Sweden. Why? Because Sweden is what we call a neutral country. That means I'll be safe there. That's good. Since you're so good with maps, maybe you can show me where Sweden is? We are here. And there, is Sweden. A long WHY- All the prisoners out! Faster! You disappoint me. None of them talked. One was promising, but he died on me. Well, what can you do? Hey, here's an idea. Maybe the prisoners didn't talk because there's nothing to say. Because your man is dead. I was contacted by the Reich Main Security Office. And they are indeed anxiously awaiting a report. No, not until I am sure. Fine. Keep moving! You want to know what I think? I think you... are chasing a ghost. There is no trace of this man anywhere. We have searched every farm and house. We have spoken with every person who could have known anything. There is no sign of him. Delays are not much appreciated in Berlin. Go to the Eastern Front. Himmler will read that report. And what Himmler reads, Hitler reads. You don't want to lie to Hitler, do you? I've been told I can trust you. That's right. We've been expecting you. Jan Baalsrud. We're almost there. - Good. Here, 42. How did you know? Tiny guy like you? I just picked the smallest. Thank you. Peder. Peder. Here, take this backpack, food, some extra clothes for your trip. And this, too. You need to hide your uniform when you get to Lyngseidet. My skis, too. - I can't take your skis. I can't keep them. I'd never forgive myself. Okay. Let's go over the plan again. - I'm going to Sweden. - Right. Then to England. Then change socks. And come right back here. Okay. Look at this. Here is Lyngseidet. It's an important hub. Now, it's full of Germans. But you can't get around it. You see, the mountains are too steep on both sides. They're mostly searching along the coast. So they won't expect to see you in Lyngseidet. Look. That is Kurt Stage. He heads the Gestapo up here. We think he knows you're alive. They say no one has ever escaped him before. So for him, it's personal. He'll never let a saboteur like you get away. If you make it over to Sweden, it will be a crushing defeat for him. Type this up and send it to Berlin and France. Yes, sir. Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler. Excellent. Thank you. - Sure. This is as close as we can get. I can wade ashore. You'd never get dry again. You'd die. Give me the skis. Now you. No. Come on. Wait. There. Now you look like a real Northerner. There's a boat waiting for you on the other side of the field. Just leave it adrift so no one knows where you go ashore. You understand that, yes? If you have to cross the mountain before you reach the border, if the weather holds up, it should take two or three days. At least you have skis now so you stand a chance. Good luck. To the commander in chief of the SS and police in Norway. Provisional report on the sabotage cutter Brattholm in Toftefjord. On March 29, 1943, units from the Navy and Abwehr detained a fishing boat with Norwegian saboteurs who had been trained in Great Britain. There were 12 saboteurs on board. 10 were arrested and interrogated. And according to the Fuhrer's orders of October 18, they were promptly executed. One saboteur was killed on site. The final man was last observed swimming in a Norwegian fjord. I have personally made it a priority to thoroughly investigate and establish with certainty that he could not have survived in these Arctic waters. Hey! Hey, you! I thought Norwegians knew how to ski. Thank you. I followed his tracks straight into the avalanche. I lost him here. Are you sure? Wenders here thinks he's a ghost. Certain. If he did survive, there are three different ways down the mountain. Here, here and here. I am quite sure it was him. And that he may be alive. Don't just stand here. Get out! Did you send that report? Yes, of course. Immediately, Sturmbannfuhrer. That's good. Just checking. - Broken skis. - Ja. What is that? A backpack. Hey! Hello? Can you hear me? Baalsrud? Race you to the rocks? Huh? I'm not up for that right now. Please leave. Feeling sorry for yourself? Come on! Be quiet. Hey, you're the one talking. Come on. Ready, set, go! Let's be quick. I want to ask our questions and be on our way. Marius Gronvoll? Marius Gronvoll? - Mhm? Seen anything suspicious lately? No. No suspicious people? Good. I was wondering... How do you become one of you? I mean they don't admit just anyone. - No, that's true. - Yeah. You must have real faith in your cause? - Yes. - Yeah. That patch, the one on your arm. Are you proud of it? I've always wondered how you get one. Do you put your name on a list, or actually do something? We have checked everywhere. The man we are looking for is around 1.75 meters, dark hair, most likely wearing a Norwegian uniform, and reportedly walks with a limp. Hmm, okay- Let me remind you, to help, hide, or in any way assist an enemy of the Third Reich is punishable by death. Is that understood? Yes? - Yes. - Right. Good. We're done here. Let's go. We need to keep looking. On to the next farm. Yes, one more bite. Ottar, out! If anyone comes, let us know. Come, here. We have to get these off. We have to get his circulation going. Do you know? YES. Get all our bandages, and woolen underwear. Hanna! Hey. Everything will be okay. It's fine. You're safe here. I followed his tracks all the way from the avalanche. The avalanche? The one from three days ago? Yes. There are posters everywhere. We could be killed. - We know that. They'll burn our house, like in Telavag. They torched everything. His feet are bad. You saw them, right? He doesn't need us, he needs a doctor. And Ottar... - We can't call a doctor now. It's too dangerous. More dangerous than risking our life for a man with gangrene? He could die at any moment. He isn't going to die. We are going to him. We'll salt him, use mother's ointments, do everything we can. What if it were me? What if it were me in there? Hanna. This is how we prove who we are and what we believe. - Where? - Outside. Ottar has already kept guard for six hours. I'll relieve him. He won't wake anytime soon. We found something. Come here. Obersturmbannführer? Sorry to interrupt, but you need to see this. We found it in the avalanche above Gronvoll farm. Give me that. We found this hat in the same area. Shh, easy, easy. Careful. Here, take this. There. Lie back down. I told you I'd be here when you woke up. I've changed your clothes and bathed you. And you got Marius' underwear. Marius? Is he your husband? No, he's my brother. Who are you? Gudrun. - Gudrun? - Mhm. Shh. - What? The animals. I never used to be this jumpy. Me neither. Where is my uniform? I have washed it. Did you find a map, or a drawing, maybe? No. How are your eyes? Much better. And your name is Jan. Jan Baalsrud. You were talking in your sleep. Did I say anything else? Yes, you said a lot. Sorry. I have some vital information the Germans must never get. It would be better if you knew nothing. Bombay. In India? Have you been? YES. You talked about elephants and birds. And you talked about, umm... dancing in London. And you called out for... someone named Per, Sigurd, Erik, and a lot for, for Gabriel. Listen... There is a reason you've survived, Jan. A reason for all this. - Who is that? - Don't move. Where is my gun? I've ruined everything for you. Shh, not a sound! We have been here twice before. We found nothing. You. What's your name, son? Sorry, he's shy- Ah. That's okay. I don't need him to say much. Have you seen the soldier? - Thank you. - Yeah. Good? We have three additional farms to search before it gets dark. Before dark? You're funny. We have to get you down to the road. Watch his foot. Watch his foot. - Careful, careful! There's a cabin on the other side of the fjord. You'll be safe there, until we find a way to get you to Sweden. Pull! Careful! - Pull! - Come on! You'll be fine. - Let's go. Shh, Shh. - Halt! - What? Stop. Come back here! - I know someone in there. He's... - Sorry, no. Some food. To keep you warm. And here is my knife. Don't lose it. This is better than the Savoy Hotel. What? The best hotel in London. But it can't compare to this. Marius, we have to head back before someone notices we're gone. Yes. It encourages people that the Germans haven't found you. I'll make the most of my time. I will be back on my feet soon. Take your time. You won't get kicked out of the Savoy. Okay? - Yes. Your feet? YES. Give me a couple of days. I'll find a way to get you across the border. Dan} Savoy Hotel... One Esquire, please. Nothing here. Let's check the cellar. There are tracks in the snow. Here he is! We have him! 'Jan? It's me, Marius. I've found a way to get you to Sweden. That's good news. What happened? Gangrene. It was eating its way up. And I had to stop it. How is it now? Feels better. Put him down here. Okay! Here. - Thank you. Here, it's cold. Put this on. And now this. No, around there. There. Move your hand. Okay, good. There. Okay. The other one. Give him that. Here, eat this. Thank you. I think we got everything out. Except the smell. You'll get plenty of fresh air from now on. We're bringing you up the mountains. Someone from Manndalen will meet us. They'll get you across. Does this sled stop in Sweden? We'll see. Wait, wait. - Hold it there! - Yes? ' Yes? Can you turn it around? Stop, let's switch the ropes. Hold there. - Okay, I've got him. - Pull! Come on. Plane! He's passed out. Turn him back around. I told them to meet us by the big rock. We'll have to leave you here. I'm sorry. We have to get back to Furuflaten before they start looking. If they find me, they'll find you too. It's okay. This new sleeping bag is dry and warm. I'll be fine. The Manndalens will be here soon. They'll use code phrase "Hello, gentleman." Gentleman? YES. We felt that suited you best. Focus on Sweden. Isn't it fascinating? Why don't they like us, these Norwegians? And our fugitive... He has turned Operation Martin Red into a complete success! There. See that? Did you see the monogram? Their king, him they love. They're getting bolder by the day. Much too bold. The last thing we need now is for them to find another symbol. Where do you think he is now? I hope he's in Sweden surrounded by Swedish nurses. Cute ones. - So do I. - Do you? Marius Gronvoll? That's me. Is there someplace we can speak in private? Right here. - Who are you? - Better if you don't know. Your gentleman hasn't been found. We've searched day and night, but we can't find him. But it's been four days already. Why didn't you come sooner? Just mark that stone in Olmmaijarvi better and we'll find him. - Where? - Olmmaijarvi. Not Olmmaijarvi, Olmmaivaggi. I'll go mark the stone. - I'm coming. - What about Hanna and Ottar? Hanna and Ottar will be asleep. Someone has to stay and care for the animals. I've fed them, Marius. - What if the Germans come? - Then you should be here. Ottar can talk to them. - He's 10. Then Hanna can talk to them. I'm going- You're too fond of him, Gudrun. No. We don't know what to expect up there. If he's dead... - He's not dead! Don't say that. If you lose it up there in the mountains, I don't know what I'll do. - He isn't dead! I'm bringing Agnete. She has nursing experience. Here... here. Hello, gentleman? Hey! It's not your fault. Marius, Marius! Why are you here? Someone else was... - A misunderstanding. It's okay. I promise. Got him? - Yes. I'll go mark the spot. Warm soup. Hope you like peas. He's a good man. He's a good man. When did you run out of food? I'm not out of food. Here. One lick for breakfast. Dinner, one lick. Supper. And extra for the weekend. Listen... You're this close. This close. You've brought us hope. Give my best to Gudrun. He's alive. And he says hi. He's here, come! Hello, gentleman? - Marius? - No, I'm Nigo. Me and these boys are bringing you to Sweden. You must be lousy skiers, since it took you so long. You're thin enough I could have come alone and carried you myself. - We can't make it! - Yes, we can! Come on! We have to keep going! Are we in Sweden? No. We hit a blizzard and we had to turn back. - Back? - Yes. - You turned back? - Just a few kilometers. - Have we backtracked? - We're in Manndalen. You promised to take me to Sweden! And I will get you to Sweden. You said you'd get me across the border. Listen to me! Why did you turn back? There was a blizzard! I continued on to the border to scout the route we were going to be taking. And listen, Jan, if we hadn't turned back, we wouldn't be here today. There are Germans everywhere. There are so many guard posts, each is within sight of the next. Do you understand? Then there's no hope. Yes, there is hope! Look at me, Nigo. I'm skin and bones. If I survive this, it will be nothing short of a miracle. Do you understand? That's why I'm going to help you. Because we need a miracle. Are you taking my gun? Yes, I think that's best. But I need it for protection. Promise not to use it on yourself? ' “Ward Get moving! All hands on deck! Get down! Hold the fuse. - It wouldn't light! - Hold on. Over the side. Jan! Jan! ' Dan} Who are you? I am Aslak Fossvoll. Eat your soup while it's still warm. I brought you a fresh pair of socks. You sure need them. It's freezing out here. See anything? No. Don't tell me the Germans have stolen our northern lights too. Binoculars, Jan. Kill the engine. I found it. We are... here. Do we have a local contact? Our mission was to destroy strategic targets. Get the briefcase. 12 of us. We had eight tons of explosives on board. But we couldn't land where we first planned. So we had to find a new contact. The contact's name? Anna Pedersen. Anna Pedersen? He's dead. And you are? Hakon, Hakon Sorensen. The information we had was outdated. And the person we talked to could not be trusted. - Get me the police. - Start the engine! Start the engine! When we returned, we had no time before we were discovered. An then everything fell apart. We had a briefcase full of information. Get going! We tried to destroy the evidence. I was the last man overboard. They took everyone. I was the only one who got away. Make sure this wasn't all in vain. Everyone who helps me risks their life. I don't know if anyone has been killed because of me. The worst part is not knowing. These men have battled in the trenches for months. And they continue fighting to defeat the enemy, giving everything for The Fatherland. The bloodthirsty Soviets have met their match. In Norway, a successful operation led by Lieutenant Colonel Kurt Stage, intercepted a fishing vessel. Stage reports that 12 saboteurs were captured and that the operation was a complete German success. Damn it! - Here. - What is this? Halt! Go on. Here. This is London, transmitting on a 1,500-meter long wave, one wave at 19 meters, two at 31 meters, and one at 41 meters. I sit by this microphone not to report accidents, but to bring greetings to all compatriots listening. I make myself the spokesman for everything we achieve together. And I hope every listener at this moment feels how strong every man's heart is beating along with his own. Someone was just here. No one's been here for two days. We still can't move him. This doesn't look good. Have you lost the map? I know you'll find your way. Make sure this wasn't all in vain. Congratulations! Today is a special clay, Jan. Happy Constitution Day. Hooray for Norway. May 17th. And no aquavit? The eggs are from, from Olaf. And the syrup is from Ludvig. The cream is from Peder, even though the Germans have raided his place four times lately. And Signe baked it. The flag, well, the eight-year old made it for you. Happy 17th of May, Jan. God bless our dear Fatherland. - Is the snow melting? - Yes. Then how will you pull me across on the sled? We're not sure you're strong enough, Jan. I'm sure. This isn't about me. So, nothing? These Northerners are useless. But the Sami are even worse. May I ask what you were talking about? Yes, you may ask. What were you talking about? He had some questions, wanted to know when the snow normally melts on the plateau. And you told him? I simply told him the truth. - And what's that? - Only the gods know. But I'd move him pretty soon if I were you, young man. I know for a fact this snow isn't going to last. You understand? You might be interested to know the Baal brothers are moving their herd across the border in a few days. My name is Aslak Baal. Jan Baalsrud. There's still one bullet left. Sorry I lost my temper. No, good to see you're human too. You need to go. Marius, you know that kerchief mother gave me? - Hmm? - I gave it to Jan. Did you check that nothing was left behind? Did you check? It was dark. I was focused on Jan. I don't know if anything was left. Why is that kerchief so important? Because it has my initials on it! How do you intend to hide a fugitive like me in broad daylight? We have a plan. Once near the border, I'll go ahead and steer the herd in the right direction. We'll give you our strongest animal, one that knows the route well. It won't give up until you're across. If things go wrong and they capture me, I'd rather die by a Norwegian bullet. Okay-. GO, go, 90/90-' Go, go! Hoo, hoo! Guard change! He seems to have spent weeks in this cabin. We found supplies inside, leftover food, fuel and candles. We have long suspected this. We think he stayed here a while. Ready? The border is coming up. Not far to go now! Is this yours, hmm? Answer the question! Is that your toe? I want to know where he is! Look. Get down here. Careful! He might be armed. Stop! This is Guard Tower Six. What is it? This way. There's a reason you've survived, Jan, a reason for all this. - Did you hear that? - Over here. He made it across, sir. What? Jan, it's over now. You can let go, Jan. It's over now. You're safe. You can let go. Thank you. Dan} Listen. Don't be afraid. We'll put an end to this madness.
