Come on, final ball, winning point! Okay. Very good. Your wrist. - Yes. Super. That's enough for today. Thank you. Top, how much? 42 Good training, Jonas, very good. Bye, Jonas, see you Wednesday. Hi! Are you ready? - Yes. - Hi, Jonas. Hey, you all right? - Yes. Are you ready for today, Jonas? - Yes. Want a ride? - No, it's okay. He runs back. I take the train. Want something to drink? - Yes. Will you join us? - Yes. Bye, Bernard. - Ciao, Bernard. But Jonas, those are excuses. You're an idiot and you do not have the guts. - Whatever! No, but love and sexuality, that is not the same. The first time is important, no? I want to do it with someone I love. Who is it? Come on, who is it? - No one. She doesn't want to anyway. And why? She is super intelligent, she goes to the 6th year. And then? - She will not want to. But Jonas you're not inferior. Jonas, you have to take your chances. You should not underestimate yourself. If I were your age I would definitely be in love with you. Yeah, but you're an idiot. What's the girl's name? - Delphine. To Delphine! Did you have fun here? - Yes. I love you. I would like to take the time to talk with you, but ... well... I take it you already suspected this... We don't think it's a good idea to hold you back another year. Then your classmates will be 3 or 4 years younger than you. We believe it's better if you go to a technical or vocational school. How much did I have for French? 9. But Ms. Libotte says that without your big problems in spelling and grammar, you would have had good points Go to Ms. Lambert in the PMS center. She will help you find a new school. Agree? Will you ask your mom to call me? You will not forget? All the best. Goodbye, Jonas. Jonas! What? - How did it go? No, they do not want me restart. Really? - Yes. What a bunch of assholes. Mom called. You have to call back. Hey, Mom, it's Jonas. Well, I just wanted to say that I failed. I got my report card and ... Anyway ... They will not let me pass. I'll call you later. She has played well. 40-0. And? - It's okay. What, it's okay? - I have two transition exams. Which subjects? Chemistry and geography. Come on! - Forget it. Get in the water! No, no, it's okay. - How brave, Pierre! No, no. - Yes, come now! He will not go in the water. Come on. - No, I don't want. Damn! On your lovers, Jonas! - On your dick! We drink on Jonas dick. Well, how was it? Good. Yes? - Yes. It was good, that's it? But again: How good? How good was it? - Really good. It was really good! - Leave him alone! So you're happy? - Yes. How many times have you done it? - 1 time. And how long did it take? - I do not know ... An hour? But no, not even. - How long than approximately? - I do not know ... - 5-6 minutes ... - Oh yes! 5-6 min plaisure, that's still 5-6 min of happiness. And how was she? Wait! How was she? Was she good, at ease? What has she done to you? Nothing fancy. Has she sucked you, shown you things, caressed you down there? - No. He takes it easy. - And how did you do it? On the sofa. - Yes. - Was she down? On all fours? - We lay down. - She on top? Yes ... uh no ... vice versa. Yeah ... Okay, the missionary position. Yes ... One brave little missionary. Was it her 1st time too? - Yes. That's normal. My 1st time was with someone my age, just as inexperienced. He was done in 5 minutes, I was not even wet. It was horrible. It was only when I met someone with more experience who showed me things, otherwise I would still not have cum. Well yes, sorry, with you I would have ... I started to get worried already. And the guy with more experience, am I? No, an old man. - I thought so, if her 1st orgasms were with me ... That was late! - Well, yes ... Everything okay? Where have you been? - At the sea. When you pass you can clear the table, no? - Okay, I'll do it. You also want to move your ass please? What are you going to do for school? What are you waiting for? It's vacation, relax! When are you going to spring into action? - What is that to you? Help me! 40/30 Damn. - Game ... 5/4 Time. 0/15 The training is okay. In a game, you're too nervous. You lose it. Listen, Jonas Take it easy on the tennis. Concentrate on your studies. Okay? Okay, Jonas? I screw up everything. At school, tennis, I'm a failure. Calm down. You'll pass year exams. I don't even have exams! They don't want me anymore. I have to go to the losers. And where is it? - The vocational school. Where failures go. Bastards! Come on, Jonas. No, no, I don't want to. - Yes, come. Do you have a bucket? - In the bathroom. About the school, don't sweat it. You're not dumber than another. And what does she think? Mom says it's okay. She has faith in me. And you? What do you want to do? I want to go to the federation, but ... But Jonas ... You really thought you were going to be a pro? Or there is the exam committee. But that's super heavy. And how would you prepare for that? Well, a private school ... Wait, your mother can not afford that. My father, he can at least do this. That's what he can. If you need help, Give me a call. Pierre has even managed to drag Didier through college. It was hard. I have two transition exams. If I succeed, I still have three years to go and I've had it. That's why I thought of the exam committee. Because at the exam committee, you can do three years in one. I do not understand. You only have two exams, that's not too bad. For once that you can succeed ... - Yeah, but ... I'm tired of sitting with little brats of 14 Yes, Jonas But then you had to start working earlier. How much does it cost? 1000 euros 1000 euros a month? No way! Can't you give a part of it? No, you go to school like everyone else, It's not that bad. 1000, what else! I failed. - What! I failed, they won't even hold me back. I have to go to the vocational school. I told you that if you had failed, I would stop paying alimony. What does she do? She leaves you alone. She goes to the south and thinks that everything will go well here. She wants to take care of you by herself but she does not. Then it's her fault if things go wrong. Why do I always have to fix everything? Has she told you to come here? - No. 1000 euros per month! She has never had scruples, but now she exaggerates! Inhibitions she had never But this! She has always gotten everything, and she wants more! I gave her the house. Do you realize what that means? That she fixes it herself now! What should I do? - Ask your mother. She has to find a solution. Per month! You go to Brussels? Great, thanks. Super. You can make the exam for the exam committee as a free student. You should therefore not go to school. That's impossible. That is much too heavy. But no, we can help you. - Yes. I will make inquiries. We'll do it together, okay? The bastard! He makes another child with a slut and he can not even take care of his own. Listen, Jonas Don't call your father a bastard. He probably does what he can. You can also see this as a real opportunity. It is a challenge. If you succeed, you will always be safe. Do you know what you have to learn for the exam committee? - Yes. And it's not because Pierre is going to help, that you will succeed. Have you been to dad? - Yes. What did you tell him? I told him. And what did he say? Nothing. Nothing at all? He said nothing. Are you sure I need all that? - Yes. I'll pay you back. Don't worry. I can pay it. Do you have a historical atlas? - No I'll use yours. I rather you have your own things. For example: A is your pencil, B is your eraser. What is C then? That. - Yes. And what is "it"? Pencil and eraser. - I restart the exercise. I have ... a pencil and an eraser, equal to a pencil plus an eraser. Then a pencil plus an eraser minus an eraser equals ... ? A pencil. So A. - Exactly. Exactly. Mathematics is not more than that.. It is sometimes complicated, but it remains very concrete. You have to promise me that if you don't understand it, you ask me immediately., Otherwise it will not work. You have to learn how to learn. And I will be glad if you do not longer need me. Well? Do not touch me! I wanted to know if you're okay. Why?. Everything okay?? Got that? What are you doing, old man? Come on! Hey, you're jealous! Fuck you! Everything okay? Why didn't you come? - I had a game. How did it go? - Super. I've had enough of it. I'm going to study for the exam committee. That's all right. Are we going out? - Yes. What is it? Nothing. I do not know ... What? I don't go too fast? No. Did you cum? Yes. He is ready to throw the bomb at the Duke when he realizes that the Duke is accompanied by his 2 children. He would rather wait. The whole piece is about commitment, and how far you are willing to go for that commitment. For example, would you blow yourself up in a bus in the name of freedom? No. I don't want to kill innocents. You think like Camus. He says: He says: What are the limits of striving for justice? Even though our intentions are good, is there a limit that we are not allowed to cross to reach them? Then Camus replies: "Between my mother and my country... ...I choose my mother." He thinks that his mother could be in the bus. Is everything alright with Delphine? - Yes, it is. That does not sound very convincing If you want to talk, go ahead. What is it? I'm afraid that ... Afraid of what? Don't be afraid! We have no secrets from each other. Go on, don't be scared I think I'm too fast. I think she does not have orgasms and I can not ... You can not hold it. - Yes. This is normal in the beginning. You lack experience, that's all. Sexuality, one learns like everything else. Sexuality is like all the rest, you still have to learn. How can you please a woman with good sex if you've never touched one? That's impossible. This takes time. You should try experimenting. Nathalie can explain a few things. If I had someone, with more experience when I was your age it would have saved me a lot of problems. What is super important is foreplay. Do you think you can make a woman cum even without penetrating her? I can do that anyway. You, I do not know. And Delphine, has she rather vaginal or clitoral orgasms? I don't know. When you are inside her, do you feel contractions? I don't know. If she twitches, she is vaginal. Nathalie has no contractions, she's looking for years already. Do you know what a clitoris is? - Of course. I hate to ask, but do you still have your foreskin? My what? Your foreskin. I ask you that because they cut Didier his foreskin making it less sensitive so he lasts longer. If you still have your foreskin, it is normal that you're so quickly to cum, you're more sensitive. But... what is super important when having sex is that you are relaxed, otherwise it is normal that you cum too quick. It's hard to relax, as she is always below you. If you are in her, you must ask the right questions. Come on, come to me? - It's okay. But no, come here. - Let me do it. No, come on! - Let me make ... Come. Why? Didn't you like it? - Yeah, that's not it. It was good, right? Yes, but I want you to cum inside me. Let me continue, it will do you good. No, Jonas. - But let me do it. - I don't want to. Do you feel anything? Yes, but... I just want you to come to me. Here! Do you accept that, too? - Yes. Put it straight into the freezer? - Okay. Good? What's for dinner tonight? - Chicken croquettes, okay? Yes, great. We have found a working method. It's really cool. I don't know how to thank you. I owe you a favor. Hold on, Pascale. - No. You have food prepared for us, that is very good. And have you seen your Italian again? - Shut up about that. What? - Thanks for that formidable plan! Want some wine? - Who is that Italian? It was your idea, no? It is really fun going back to studying this curriculum, teaching Jonas. Really enjoyable. Make him work hard. If he doesn't work, then call me, okay? I am confident. And you accepted Tommaso's gift? No, and you know it. - Why not? - Because you don't accept something like that. Yes you do. - No, not if it happens like this. What does that mean? - Who is this Tommaso? - Nothing, a ... moronic ... Italian ... - Not a moron, very generous. Didier introduced me to him. Yes, that's correct. would you like a drink? - Yes, please. Thank you. Big kiss. Work hard, huh? - Yes. If there's anything, you'll call me, okay? We'll leave it at that. The written examination was bad, why should it go better now? No, wait! I know this. You must know your material better. - 2 minutes, please. Sorry, there are still candidates waiting. Goodbye. - Work well. And it's still the 1st test. It's like tennis. You put yourself under too much pressure. This is not a race, Jonas. You'll get there at your own rhythm. You will become tired. But no, I know very well that it will take time. And it's not because you're not capable. Think you can just absorb 3 years of material at once? You're not Superman. Nobody expects you to be. You did not get the necessary help for years. You don't fix that at once. Did you call your mom? What did she tell you? I should not lower my courage. Do not worry. I know very well what I started. I especially don't want that you doubt yourself. Agreed? Come on! You're lucky that someone with a lot of patience deals with you. Do not wear blinders. don't believe in a religion that makes you empty promises, don't blindly follow a moral that imposes you a way of life that you have not chosen. That's revolt! Remain conscious, Always look at things more closely. Example, if I tell you: You must love your parents? Yes. Why? Because they have put us on the world. And because they did, they deserve a life of respect that you shouldn't doubt? Yeah, maybe. No, wait, if you consciously think that, that's okay. But if you're just applying an imposed morality, I do not agree. Someone can have very good reasons to hate his parents. If he doesn't do it for external reasons, he is not aware, and certainly not a rebellious man. Later we have a chapter on Don Juan. In your eyes, is he a decent man Yes. What did you think honestly? No. And why? - Because he runs after all the girls. - Is that bad? Wait, I ask the question differently: Is that necessarily bad? No. What does Camus say? That we, faced with an absurd world, have to live as intensely as possible use all that is given to us, challenge the world, experience as many experiences. No imposed limits or prohibitions, because borders are totally artificial. He says: "Every healthy creature attempts to reproduce." And so does Don Juan. He experiences various love affairs very intensely rather then reduce himself to a single passion. I want to read you a passage. There it is ... "The only generous love is the one who realizes that she's both volatile and particular at once. These are all the endings and rebirths that constitute Don Juan's life. That is his way to give and let live. Everyone can judge whether or not this is selfishness. Well, it's late. We go to sleep. Think about it? - Yes. You should not feel obligated. Really, I'd prefer that you work. That's for you. Are you crazy? - It's my pleasure. Would you like lasagna? Lasagne? - Yes. You're nuts. It's his last novel. But he died before he could finish it. It is about his childhood... ... In Algiers. He lived with his mother and grandmother because his father died when he was one. His mother could neither read nor write and they had no books at home. His mother did not even want him to study. But when his teacher saw he was super intelligent, He has paid his studies. Thanks to him, he was awarded the Nobel Prize. When he received it, he wrote him a letter of thanks. The letter is at the back of the book. It's beautiful. You can borrow others too if you like to read it. I have them all. I don't know, I have not actually felt much. Maybe she doesn't know how. A good fellatio is not that easy. Yes, or maybe I have a problem. That you can only know if you do it with someone who has more experience. Otherwise, it's impossible. But ... I can't find someone else to do it. I understand. Anyway... It would be stupid if your relation would end because of sexual problems, no? 4 NH35 O2. Yes. 4 NO. Okay. Super. There, that is 18. ...+2 Yes, perfect. Will you continue? - Yes. You like that actress? Yes, she's okay. And her? Yeah, you like her. You know .. Pierre has explained it a little. If you want, I want to try to see if everything is okay. Just to be sure. Whether the problem lies with you or ... ... with Delphine, I don't know. And Didier? - He doesn't care. It does not matter? - No. It's not because you occasionally cheat, that you don't love each other. Well, it's like you want. I just want to help. You should not be embarrassed. It does not matter. I leave them on my rack for you to watch Search me the limit of this function. How can you find it? By determining the derivative. Jonas, what do you think of Nathalie? Handsome. - Yes. I believed you thought she's ugly. - No, why? I don't know ... It doesn't matter, I have no problem with that. What is cheating someone for you? Do not know. Sleeping with someone else. Sure? Yes. I do not think it is. Cheating ... for me ... ... Is if. .. if he stays with that person without wanting that. What do you mean? Well, the guy who always dreams to be with another woman, but who never does it because he's afraid. To me he is unfaithful, while the guy who's in a good relationship with his wife, but occasionally does it with someone else is not necessary unfaithful I think. Besides, in your case it's sex education, it's not even about greed. But it's when my father began to cheat, that it went wrong with my mother. That might be because he does not distinguish between love and sexuality. I would not cheat on Delphine. Agreed. No one forces you what to do anything with Nathalie. I'm not going to rape you. We might be able to show you things. Just looking, that's okay. So good ... When you watched a porn movie, you didn't cheat on Delphine. - No. And this is the same. Except that there is no screen. See? It also makes the two of you have fun. It is important to say what you like. Whether you want her to jack you off or suck you right away. Did she once ... You see, while ... you're in her mouth, she needs to continue to jack you. If you want her to slow down, you tell her. Or that she firmly grips you, or with a continuous motion. That is especially good in the beginning. She can caress your balls. If you don't want to say it, you just lay her hand on your balls. For example ... Slowly ... And when she enters? - But no, she will not come. You will like it. What are you doing? Let me. Hold on, hold on. Why? I'm sorry. You don't have much experience. - No. Does it bother you that we talk about it? Then you have to say. It's okay. At your age I also was ... ... A little uptight? No, but I was not at ease. The pleasure does not come by itself. You should be well supervised. You have to dare to let go, you have to trust each other. This is not so simple. Do not worry, everything is normal. And it comes with time. Really. You know, if you need advice ask me, I'm there for you. Fine by me. What is it? - What did you tell them? Nothing. - Yes, right. Delphine, come on. Wait. - No, I must go. What are you doing? Stay! - No, I don't want to. The coordinates of the four points are? Concentrate, will you? Sorry. What's up? Nothing. She'll call you. She panicked. You have to understand her. But you should not run after her. Let her come back. And concentrate now. Reread the problem. Specify on the graph points A 'B' C 'D', the respective image of A, B, C, D by the orthogonal symmetry the axis of which is the straight line of the quotients, Y is equal to X. And give their coordinates. I do not understand. I have to concentrate on my work. I don't prevent you from working. Is it because of the other night? What have I done? Nothing. Why would you be different? I'm not. Yes. You are. I have to work, that's all. Work well. After a week you won't think about it anymore. You will see, you will still have enough adventures. It is simply because you are evolving faster than your peers. It's normal that they're less interesting. Now you have to ... You have to concentrate, otherwise it will not work. But it doesn't matter. It's normal, it's the 1st time. It's normal that you want to believe you're in love. But you will see later, you will laugh. You can't spoil everything for the sake of a little adventure. That's it. Is it correct? - Yes. Really? - Yes, perfect. And good luck for everything else. - Thank you. Your hand down on the handle. A little more to the right. Okay. - Like this? Come on, you. Concentrate - Okay. Move, move. - Okay. Calm down. - What? Why do you hit so hard? Easy. - Okay. Come on, not so fast! Wait, wait, a service, here, Pierre. Forward. Calm down. What are you doing? More serious. - Okay. Come on, yeah. Forward. That's better. - Yeah, last one, quickly. What? Come on. Okay. - Come on. And? - Passed. Super. Hi, Bernard. Jonas has passed math. - Bravo! On your success! Same is for chemistry. So .. Here ... for you. You're crazy. I love gifts. Yours is great! Mine is bigger, yes. I like that! What is it? No, I'm grateful. - What? For everything. This is not over yet. Well, to your discoveries and ... - To Freedom! It was strong, huh? Yeah, it was good. And what if I would say that Didier was the one sucking you? How would you respond? - I don't know ... It was Didier. Only guys blow really good. And Didier ... Is he gay? What do you think? Nathalie is a boy? It's not because you act homosexual that you're gay. Basically, I think we are all bisexual. It's just a matter of choice. There are curious and courageous people and there are others. The weak, who tell make believe stories and lie to themselves. We are afraid of our natural curiosity to approach one another. But disapproval, inhibition, that makes no difference. No matter what you do ... where there is fear, there is desire. Yes, but ... ... I'm not attracted to boys How can you say that if you haven't tried it? People who claim to be straight, without ever trying to do something, make me laugh. How can you say in a restaurant whether a dish is good or bad, if you have not tasted it? When Didier blew you, it was the same as with Nathalie. You noticed no difference. But I'm not attracted to them. If I see a boy, I feel nothing. No, wait. I understand that. I was like you. Then, I started to doubt. I needed to experience things first to understand. I have evolved, and then ... It's true, I've started experiencing too late and ... that's why I feel like I messed up my childhood a little, but ... But you ask yourself these question already, so you're not far from the answer. But at your age I didn't have your maturity. And you, do you sometimes have relationships or are you gay? No, I'm not. What annoys me are men who act like they are women. No, when I was as old as you, I was into a girl very much in love. She was the woman of my dreams. And then she left. After that I never had such feelings anymore. But good. There is something that I ... There is something of great importance. And that is that sex ... And feelings are entirely different things. I think that sex is not that important. You have to keep it in the right place. Okay, Jonas? I've had enough. You should occasionally relax. Otherwise, you can not hold on. Calm down. It's like with Didier. Let yourself go. Can you check that, please? - Yes. "Moment" is neuter, so ... Consequently ... It is "it". Where are you now? Yeah, shit. No, but that's okay, Pascale. That's okay. Listen, here everything is fine. I am super happy. He works very well. Yes, yes, but don't worry. Really. Okay, I'll ask him. I will tell him that you called. If anything, you call me. Bye. What does she want now? You should call her back. She had a quarrel with her boss ... She went home. Okay, sweetie? Am I disturbing you? What is it? Nothing. I wanted to see you. May I come in? You are alone? Why you never visit me, I don't get it. I have exams. It's a little complicated. I would like to have you at home. Do you feel comfortable here? - Yes, I do. What is it? Nothing. You eat properly? You can give me your laundry if you want. - Mom, stop it. What do you mean, "stop"! Don't you miss the garden? No What is it, I do have the right to see you? Sure, but not here. Good, then you come to me. If I have time. You're gonna get some fresh air from time to time? I've got a lot of work, Mom. I have the impression that you ... That you don't realize it. Do you know what it takes, to succeed for the exam committee? I have to continue working. Here, give it to Pierre. What will you do? No idea, I'll rest. Take care of yourself, okay? How was your day? - Fine. My mother came by. What did she have to say? - Baloney. Here, she has given this for you. What's that money for? I don't know, it's for you. She gives you nothing, and I get money while I don't need it? What does she think? I don't do it for the money. Here, take it. What does she imagine? I like her, but ... It's especially for you, that it hurts me. Are you coming to eat? Yes, I'm coming. Turn around ... What? - Turn around. We don't even talk to each other. I do not know how to do it. Will you talk to him? If you want to. He will tell you what's going on. And ... If he has had enough of me, You tell me, huh? We don't see you anymore, Pierre, that's too bad. The work, you know Yes. You are not obliged to spend your whole life with him. Just want to reach my goal. The people begin to believe that you're a couple. They think what they want. I know very well what I'm doing. The introduction, I think that's super. I like that. Therefore, it's a pity ... Because your statement is a bit ... - Okay, it's good. You know that the mass is equal to 32. What do you need then? Jonas, I'm asking you a question. The mass is equal to 32. I have no idea. Damn. You have to be a moron to study sciences. How could you be doing five years of such bullshit? Okay, calm down, and we resume the exercise. All for a job that you dislike. You can only teach brats. I have already explained this 15 times. Who is the moron then? you calmed down? We resume the exercise. Jonas? Leave me alone. Leave me alone, damn. You are disappointed, but that doesn't mean you should talk to me like that. You know I've done everything to make sure you would succeed. You don't care. That's not what interests you. You interested in what else. What? You don't care if I succeed. That's not what interests you. Stand up. Damn! Stand up, Let me go. - And what interests me? You don't have the right to speak to me like that. I did not deserve it. Okay, I'm listening. - Deze namiddag ik zal naar de sportclub gaan. No, I told you that's not correct. What a fucking shitty language. - If you get agitated, I quit. I'm not Pierre. Without him, you would be nowhere. So, calm down; He's not your dog. He is not obliged to do all that for you. So ... What is the first word of the sentence? - No idea. Is it the subject? No. Well then, we often talked about this. What is the rule? Conversion. - So? And where does the infinitive go? Hello, Jonas. Everything okay? What's happening? - What are you going to tell? What do you mean, what am I going to tell? What did you say to Nathalie? Nothing, I told her what happened. Nothing more. I also have my story to tell. Did you tell it to Nathalie? What then? The fact that you have abused me. Take it back immediately! You take that back immediately! Leave, I don't want to see you anymore. Do you know what abuse is? Ask the cops what abuse is. Poor victim. Why didn't you tell me you're a faggot? Why didn't you tell me that? It's not bad, huh? I'm tired of everyone messing with me. I'll take you home. Let's go to your house. You will see how it is there. I'm staying! I have the test! Madness. I didn't think you were so opportunistic. You're just a whore, Jonas. You can continue your exam work alone. That's not what interests you. Damn. What have I started! I have listened to you, helped you. You are so unfair. Damn. Get out of here, Get out. Listen. From now on, we separate working from the rest I never forced you into anything. Samantha Servais, adjourned. Sion Christophe adjourned. Patricia Steelman, succeeded. Terlasen Bruno, succeeded.
