CHILE A GALAXY OF PROBLEMS Why is it that today, in Chile, so much is forgotten? That's a good question. It's a very strange phenomenon. It has to do with the way in which the transition came about in this country. It is the outcome of a compromise between the government coalition and Pinochet; in other words, the military. The agreement was never drawn up, let alone recorded and some subjects were not broached. They were forgotten. People were systematically encouraged to turn the page. In order to rebuild the country, the past must be forgotten and that is impossible. No society can be built on the basis of forgetting. I really liked what you said the other day about the missing artworks. There's a part of our collective memory that was consigned to oblivion. This was the fate of the artworks that were kept at the headquarters of UNCTAD. During the dictatorship, they destroyed the masterpieces of contemporary Chilean art. Mario Toral. Wood panel mural. Disappeared. Mario Carreño. Tapestry. Disappeared. Héctor Herrera. Painted tapestry. Disappeared. Guillermo Núñez. Acrylic mural. Disappeared. José Balmes. Mural. Destroyed. It's simply unbelievable. There are many things which even today remain unclear. We know a little about them, but not very much. Shedding light on all that would compromise this marvellous reconstruction, this reconciliation that we're forcing upon ourselves. To reveal the truth about certain facts would endanger the compromise that was established from the start and which, inexplicably, is still intact after 20 years. I sincerely believe that forgetting the past would be hard. It's a matter of knowing how to live with the past. The way in which this past influences how we see the present, and above all, how we see the future. In Chile there are different points of view on this matter and different attitudes. Is Chile still stuck in the coup d'état? I sincerely believe it isn't. As for Pinochet, after his international trial, how is he perceived by the army? I don't feel that I can answer that on behalf of a whole group of individuals, as I've never been informed of their opinion. Each person has their own opinion of Pinochet, of him as a leader, and of the consequences of his detention in London, etc. It is a question that doesn't have only one answer. What is your opinion? For me, he is a character whom history must judge. A person who has lived for a moment... For whom... As I said, he wasn't greedy for power, he did not try to take over the government. Nothing like that. He undeniably achieved his goals thanks to what he did. He managed to stabilise a critical situation. There is also a dark side to his character, which is not insignificant in a political leader. Justice should be done for the criminal aspects of the facts for which he is reproached. For me, these historic characters are swept along by a whirlwind, as was the case of General Pinochet. I am not trying to avoid answering the question. They grapple with these whirlwinds. I don't feel that I can give an opinion of him. I really don't. What is more, I am a Christian and I respect the law. For me, the only judge, at the end of the day, is the Supreme Judge. And here below, it's the courts of justice. In all political sectors, left, right, centre, we are constantly told that we must turn the page, that our future is promising, that we must forget the past. We are constantly told that the past is useless, that it doesn't matter, that a new Chile is underway and its history starts now. I'll explain what I mean. It is here, at the end of our textbooks that our history begins. What they want is for us all to become friends, one big family. In the photo, the child is indeed a young Chilean. But it's not that simple, it's very complicated. Today, a nation state like Chile, formed in the 19th century and explained according to the 19th century, might not continue to exist. When we evoke the past, those who say that the past must be erased, overcome, are talking about the extermination policy implemented by the Chilean state, through its repressive organisations led by Pinochet, with the complicity of civilians, who today are important political figures. That is what they are alluding to, I mean the establishment, when they say that it is "indispensable" to erase that past. It is the victors who write history. The coup d'état was a terrible defeat for Chile's popular movement. Are you justifying the coup d'état? Given that I took part in it, I justify it and base my position on four fundamental arguments. First, it was not just any old coup d'état. It was a call from the institutions of the Republic for the armed forces to act. How is the reconciliation process going in Chile? I believe that we were divided on the matter from the start. For some, political reconciliation means establishing cohabitation agreements on the basis of total impunity. That is Chile's history from the start. For others, political reconciliation is primarily the recognition of the rights of the victims. But also those of the executioners. They have the right to a fair trial and to the sentence pronounced by the judge. That is new. Why don't I ask for forgiveness? Forgiving is a very personal act. I cannot do it for others. It's an act that according to Christian tradition, involves repentance, recognition, and a genuine desire to repair the error committed. I cannot do that on behalf of others. I don't know if they are repentant or if they are ready to recognise their errors and change their behaviour. What I do acknowledge, and it's better than asking for forgiveness, is that it was not just five or six individuals acting alone. We committed these errors as an institution. As I said before, we were not taught to act like that. Why did we do it? What did we do wrong? That helicopter didn't drop the corpses into the sea by chance. It belonged to the army, it wasn't parked at the pilot's house. It's the story of the people who carry out the orders. In my opinion the non-commissioned officers have no say in how they carry out the orders. I also suffer from having seen so much pain. On both sides. We still haven't spoken about the man who caused the irreparable damage. He also carries a feeling of loss. It comes across in various ways. Whatever happens, this interview must not give the impression that I am comparing the pain. I witnessed the pain of so many people from different political sectors that I can confirm that the situations cannot be compared. And neither can we compare the pain of the victim with that of the executioner. But they all suffer, that's for sure. Both parties suffer irrevocably. The right in our country has got off lightly for having supported a political genocide. In order to make that possible, for this transitional culture and the impunity agreements to be accepted, they had to foster the culture of forgetting. They had to erase the collective memory. They had to continue censoring and encouraging the population to censor itself. They had to tell people to put the past behind them and turn the page. We've used countless euphemisms over the years without ever reaching the desired goal. Because despite all that, despite the establishment's actions, we have advanced, at least in terms of light being shed on the initial phases of the repression. Not thanks to the Chilean political classes, but thanks to the victims' families, to the human rights organisations, to the honest judges and journalists who have helped us. The judges have had to face major obstacles as there was a conspiracy to encourage people to keep quiet. Many of the facts that have helped the trials progress have come to light almost by chance. For example, someone is seized with remorse, has regrets and decides to give evidence. There were three or four such cases. Thanks to this we learn that there were other people involved. The judges summon them all and thus obtain certain facts. The trials are long and complex, hindered by those involved. - You mean the military. - Of course. 40% of the cases of the violation of human rights have been adjudicated. Official statistics published this year: 40%. 60% of the cases are still pending. What are the Chilean law courts playing at? What is stopping them from progressing? Until this figure reaches not necessarily 100% but around 70% or 80%, we won't be able to get through this transition! What kind of a transition is this? We are still judging the human rights violation cases of a small number of people. If everyone was involved it would be understandable, but these are the most heinous crimes. During the meeting with General Cheyre, I asked, "Who instructs the military?" "Who teaches them democratic values?" I didn't get much of an explanation. They organised public entrance exams after this meeting, for recruitment. I asked, "In the army, do they teach them a democratic constitutional doctrine?" In fact, they still use the old, faded textbooks that date from General Schneider, General Pickering, from General Prats. Although they have the means, they haven't developed any thought model that could guide an officer of the Chilean Republic. They still swear by Pinochet's La Geopolítica, a book published in 1969 using public funds and destined for use by the military academy. It is riddled with racial classifications. People are classed according to their Caucasian or Asiatic features. - Have the textbooks changed? - Of course. Does the recruitment of instructors have to go through parliament or is it independent? It's an independent public examination system. A teacher of Spanish cannot teach maths. The teachers are not chosen because of who they know, they are recruited through public exams. During that meeting, I said to General Cheyre, "Get rid of those Nazi helmets worn by the military in the parades!" "It's unacceptable!" He replied that the helmets come from further back, from before the German army used the swastika. Yes, the swastika is an Indian symbol, but nobody uses it as a military insignia. Here, we wear the Nazi army helmet. We're the only country that uses it for military parades. It is worn by the mounted guard. It's all the more ridiculous because our soldiers have Chilean features: American, dark. Some are Mediterranean-looking, Spanish, Italian, but with Nazi helmets! That sums up the muddle-headedness of the army. Because of a so-called loyalty to its history there exists a Nazi structure within its symbology. Many other armies use it; it was not invented for the Chilean army. It's used in the United States because it affords the best protection for soldiers. That's what I think. In the minds of some, certain associations are perhaps made. Like the closed-neck uniform. Ours is one of the only armies to wear this kind of uniform. Unlike the Nazi army, our army is not an institution that is breaking down. It is absolutely urgent that three things be changed, or rather four. I wrote it down. The symbols used by our army, the military instruction, the military justice and defence systems. Nothing's been done in these areas! The Constitution also needs revising. The military seem so docile but the Constitution gives them a special place. In our Constitution, we still have the concept of national security. This is a doctrine of division and hate. A Constitution that condones this does not pass the test of constitutionality. It would not be invited to the gala of decent constitutions. When everybody renounces their principles and values, it creates a country alienated from itself. This is the case here. In our society, people don't dare say what they think, whether they voted for Allende or what they were willing to do. Few dare to talk like that. People say, "I had nothing to do with it." Especially the military, they deny everything. We've been trying to uncover those responsible for years. Most people won't assume their share of responsibility. What we should do, not just with respect to the past, but in every sense, is to learn to be responsible for ones acts. Our society must take responsibility for its past and know all about it. People say, "Never again." But never again what? To know what we're talking about, the subject must be tackled. The media today create a totally false reality, a dishonest reality. There are problems in this country which are ignored by the press. The media conceal them on a regular basis. The workers' demands, the social situation, repression in the work place, the media don't pay any attention to that. Or very little. Instead they portray the image of a country on the up, a country with incredible macroeconomic indicators. This is why Chile is high up on the international rankings. The most competitive, the most thriving. It's a paradise for the multinationals. Everything is handed to them on a plate: tax exemption, low salaries, no environmental control, total freedom of input-output, unrestricted authorisation to repatriate capital. A whole package of benefits. If Salvador Allende were to come back to life and nationalise copper again, this would have to be done as 70% of this wealth is in the hands of foreigners. In this case, the Constitution would oblige the state to pay compensation to the foreign investors equivalent to the present value of the loss of all future earnings until the mineral supply is exhausted. That is the amount of indemnity they would have to pay. 40% of children leaving primary school can't understand what they read. 40% of people who went to secondary school can't understand what they read. 40% of university graduates can't understand what they read. 40% of teachers can't understand what they read. In the face of all that, in Chile, for decades we've acted as if nothing's happened. It's a scandal, it's really shameful. It is the main reason for the inequalities in this country. Education is at the centre of this division. There is no ideological split about public works; we all want new roads. But education falls in the middle of this division. There are those who fight for the education "market" as the only solution. They would slit their wrists to defend this market. And there are those who want to kill the capitalists who profit from education. They defend public education. This division paralyses any step taken. When a law is to be passed to improve the situation, the ideological split surfaces and paralyses all discussion. We can't get beyond it. In 20 years' time, we'll still be stuck there. Chile is incapable of bridging this ideological split. Some teachers come up against problems in the classroom. When they teach, the teachers are conditioned by the textbooks. If the teacher has a different version that disagrees with the textbook, this creates difficult situations. Politics are still going on in the classroom through the textbooks; that is a reality. We should analyse the past and the political history of the country. When we speak about it with the teachers, they say it is difficult to teach that. The class is split, the parents don't want politics in the classroom, they fear their children will be indoctrinated. It is very difficult to face the problem of the past and to speak of it. Occasionally, we manage to broach the subject. We did so in 2003, for the 30th anniversary of the coup d'état. There were many programmes on television and people spoke about it a lot more. After the Valech Report was published, it was spoken about for a fortnight. But in our society we are not used to giving a name to conflicts and even less to confronting them. We have to constantly build memory. What they've done with Villa Grimaldi is very important. I imagine you have visited it. It's a place of memory, but not of fossilised memory. It's a place of memory that lives, creates and has projects. The place has sound archives. You can watch videos of the survivors' witness accounts and ours, human rights campaigners, etc. It's something in constant creation. It's important. Why are women better able to overcome the pain and to talk about it? Despite many disadvantages, women are culturally able to express their fragility. Unlike men. I don't agree with you. In general, yes, but I have had many male patients... There was one in particular who really moved me. My patients come from a working-class background. It's not the intellectuals who've been coming recently or political leaders. These are the humble leaders, those who've experienced prison and torture. Militants of the Communist Party, for example. For 30 years they kept to themselves the pain, the shame and the guilt. This man that I'm thinking of cried as I've rarely seen a woman do. On the last day, he said to me, "In the beginning, I cried more than I spoke." "Now, I speak more than I cry." It's moving because he still sheds tears. Another important element is the way they used women and children to force men to speak. As I told you, I met a young girl who met the same fate as the children who were kidnapped and locked in cages to force their fathers and mothers to give themselves up. Pregnant women lost their children at different stages of pregnancy after being tortured. This is recorded in the archives of Villa Grimaldi. For me, it is also a form of torture when a woman is raped in front of her husband or given electric shocks. Or when a husband is tortured in front of his wife. One of my patients saw her son being tortured on an electrified bed frame. It was also a form of torture when a child was imprisoned in Grimaldi with its mother. That's also a form of torture. The question is, have we done enough to ensure that it never happens again? - What do you think? - Not enough. Not enough within the political classes. Not enough within the legal system. Society has not done all that it could to resolve its problems. We haven't done enough to understand the pain of others. We haven't done enough to forgive. If the motherland feels imperilled By the traitor's deceitful blow We shall brandish our swords proudly And impose the victor's law Let us carry on with the labour Our forefathers zealously undertook Victory has always been our ally The very symbol Of our flag Within us we bear past glory And the honour of Chile triumphant The homeland has been placed in our hands With its destiny, glory and honour Subtitles: Katie Henfrey
