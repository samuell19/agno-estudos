- Ben should have been back hours ago. Hope he didn't have any trouble filing those papers. - Not as much trouble as we'll have when we ride into Soledad. [ footsteps ] - Be quiet. I hear something. - Must be getting old. I didn't hear nothing. - That you, Ben? - Yeah. - Did you file the title with the Huntingdon County recorder? - Yeah. - See any of Payne's men? - No. - Reynolds' men? - Yeah. Frank Emmett. - Frank Emmett. - Soledad's full of Frank Emmetts. I guess we'll be riding into Soledad without Ben. - So we can get shot in the back like he was? - You and Ben have talked for five years of starting a spread in Soledad. You two have lived and breathed that town. You gonna give up a five-year dream? - That dream turned into a nightmare for Ben. - Now that Ben's dead, you'll own all that land around Thousand Springs. - Land doesn't do you much good if you're six feet under it. - You've got to stop running. - You haven't stopped, have you? - I've known you 25 years, Tom, and you've never lied to me. I'll believe your story about Ben Carter, but I want you to stay out of town. Your kind ain't wanted here. And I'm forgetting you're Drew Haney's boy. - Does that sign my death warrant in your county, Marshal? - I wasn't thinking of that. We can choose a lot of things in life, but we can't pick our parents. - Just a minute, Marshal. - One nice thing about this country-- a man doesn't have to live in the shadow of his father's reputation, unless he wants to. - What are you getting at? - I haven't got any wanted poster on you yet, Haney. But with the company you're keeping, it won't be too long. - A man chooses his own company. There's no law against that. - If there was, he wouldn't be wearing that star, not with the kind of company he's kept. - Well, there's no sense of digging up the past, Tom. I'm not proud of it. Where are you two headed? - Soledad, maybe. - Oh, if you went there, Tom, you'd be in your own company. I don't know about Haney. Tom, you and I have outlived our time. The rule of the quickest gun is on the way out. Your friend Hull is a relic of the wilder west. He walks among ghosts, same as me. When you pass through Silvertown on your way to Soledad, you'll see what I mean. - What are you preaching about, Garvey? Maybe you forgot. You and me started out the same way. - But after 25 years, I've got this. What have you got? And what's he gonna have? - That all? - Yeah. That's all. Sorry, Tom. - Yep, your father and me murdered this town. And other men like us-- gunfighters, killers, men who hated the law. Yep, it ain't hard for evil to kill a town. Your pappy and me proved that. Do you want to see this happen to a town like Soledad? This is where you and me are splitting up. No sense in looking at me like that. You ain't gonna change my mind none. I already made it up. - You mean your friend Marshal Garvey made it up for you. - So what if he did? He's right, isn't he? Not much of a monument to a man's life, is it? - You're gonna stay here? You're not coming with me? - Yeah, if you go into Soledad, you'll have trouble enough. If some of those gun-happy drifters saw me, they'd try to build themselves into big men by weighing me down with lead. Yep, the odds will be heavy enough against you. I'd only make it worse. I'm going in to see some old friends. Can't hardly read it no more. [ horse neighs ] - Hey, boy. [ leaves rustling ] The water warm or cold? - Now that you've looked me over, would you like to examine my teeth for age? - I don't have to. I know how old you are. - Oh? You know my name, too, I suppose? - Sherry Vernon. You've been in Soledad for some time. Got a brother named Bob. You both came into the Ruby Hills Valley and took over the old V.W. Ranch. - Who are you? - Ross Haney. - How come you know so much about me? - I know something about almost everybody in Soledad. - You planning to stay here? - Yeah, I am. - Well, if you're as frank with everyone here, you'll make a lot of enemies. - I made 'em before I came here, Miss Vernon. If I stand too hard, it's just because I'm a hard man to please about horses and women. - I'd say your judgment of horses isn't so good, by the looks of that one. - Rio's all right. He can outrun this beauty of yours from here to Soledad. - Flame's the fastest horse in this country. - It's a fine horse. And I'll bet you my saddle against $100 that Rio can throw dirt in his face between here and the hotel at Soledad. - Saddle's not worth 100. What else have you got? - I'm betting the saddle. - All right. The saddle. - Whoa, there. Halt. - You cut across the bend. - You left me standing still. You took a running start. - I thought you wanted a fair race. - Lady, you must come from a long line of sportsmen. Forget the bet. - That horse for sale? - No, he's not...Payne. - You got the advantage. You know my name, but I don't know yours. - No? - Looking for a job? I could use an extra hand over at the Box Inn. - Cowhand or gunhand? - Got to be both in this valley. - I'm not. Guess that lets me out of a job. - Man usually carries the tools of his trade. You ain't carrying any rope on that horse. - That's right. - I'll give you double what Reynolds is paying you. - How do you know Reynolds is paying me? - Isn't he? - Maybe. Maybe not. - Join up with Reynolds, you'll be bucking Jack Voyle. He's one of my men. - Voyle the best you got? - You want to face him? - You can't face him. He always waits until your back is turned. - Right now, I could cut you in two, Haney. - I won one bet today. I feel lucky enough to make another. - Don't crowd your luck. - You draw, and I'm betting I'd take you with me. - Forget it, Voyle. When I want a killing, I'll tell you. You know him? - Yeah. He built up a big reputation around El Paso. - How come you hire men like him? - Private war between me and Reynolds. - Yeah? Who's Reynolds got? - Frank Emmett. - Might not have him long. Somebody's liable to kill him. - That job could get a man an even $1,000. - He's not worth $1,000. [ bell dings ] - This confounded plate. Never did fit. If I ever see that Dodge City dentist again, I'm gonna... Room? - Best you got. - Take your pick. They're all bad. 15's as bad as any. - Food about the same? - Yep. Oh, but the waitress takes the edge off of it. [ chuckles ] Prettiest in the west. Yep. If you can't write, just put your "X" in. It's the law. - Didn't know this town had any laws. - Well, there ain't. But there may be someday, and I want to have everything real legal-like. - You're Scotty, aren't you? I've got some regards for you from a friend of yours, used to ride for you. - My trail days are over. "Ross Haney. El Paso." [ chuckles ] Funny things about a name, a town. You know, you just might not be Ross Haney. And you just might not be from El Paso. Fact of the matter is, you might be from Rio Grande or Fort Sumter or Cheyenne, even. People are funny, ain't they? You know, I've only had about three close friends in my day. - Well, who were they? - Two guns and a horse. - How about Ben Carter? - Well, how is Ben? - He's dead. Murdered. - Huh. Will you have, uh... will you have a cup of coffee? I make it myself. - Yeah. - Sit down. How did it happen? - Reynolds' head gunslinger shot him. - Frank Emmett, huh? - Yeah. Shot him in the back. - Emmett might not be in town now. - I can wait. - You want some advice, Haney? - Breeze out of Soledad, is that it? - Forget about Ben. Just get out. - I'm favoring on settling here. - This town is gonna bust wide open. And there's gonna be blood pouring all through this valley. - The man left standing in it's gonna be top man. Did you ever see a ghost town, Scotty? - [ chuckles ] I help make 'em. - Ben and I have watched this valley and this town for five years. We figured on moving in, building this town, building ourselves, too. I don't figure it ought to be another ghost town, Scotty. - So you want to be the ghost, huh? Well, Payne and Reynolds and his gang will accommodate you if you start stepping on 'em. - I know how they got their spreads. - A man don't talk about that here if he wants to live. Payne and Reynolds run all the little fellas off of the range. And they kept 'em off with lead. What do you aim to use for ammunition? - Water. Ben and I filed claim on Thousand Springs. - You what?! - We filed claim on Thousand Springs. Payne and Reynolds own more than half of this valley illegally, Scotty. - You know too much. - We made it our business to know. Just like a general studies his terrain before the attack, I know this land like a picture map and everybody who lives on it. - Thousand Springs is the main source of water for this valley. - I know that. And I own it. - That's what the battle started about. You know, you could control this valley, you and, uh... whoever owns Histon Springs. - You own it. - Me? - You. - You want some more coffee? - No. I want the title to Histon Springs. - Title? - The title. - Nobody around here knows that I own it. - I'll keep your secret. But I want that title. - You're writing your own death notice. - I'll give you my note for $5,000. - You've got a lot of nerve, Haney. I hope you've got the brains and the gun-savvy to see it through. Because when they find out that you own the Ruby Hills water, they're gonna kill you. Write this down. March 18, 1877. For title to Histon Springs, I agree to pay Westbrook Scott-- That's me. [ chuckles ] The sum of $1.00... and the fun of watching what's gonna happen. [ up-tempo piano music playing ] - Your special. I'm looking for a guy named Frank Emmett. - Dollar's for the drink, not information. - Raleigh Burt's my name. It's none of my business, but I'd leave Emmett alone if I were you. Mister, you mix up in the Payne-Reynolds feud, you've got trouble. - You sound a little prejudiced. What side are you on? - I'm not on any side. I'm on a payroll. - Which one? - Reynolds at the moment. Which side are you working on? - Neither. - Be interesting to see how you come out. - Haney? - I'm Haney. - My sister's outside. She wants to talk to you. - You found me. So can she. - Ladies don't come into saloons. - Ladies pay their bets. - You heard me. My sister wants to see you. - [ grunts ] [ piano stops ] [ piano resumes ] You wanted to see me? - I'm sorry for the way I acted. - I'm sorry, too. - I heard about your run-in with Jack Voyle. He's a dangerous man. - He is. - You didn't back down to Voyle, yet you did a minute ago to my brother. Thank you, Haney. That's two debts I have to pay you. - Two debts? - That's the first one, your $100. I don't know how to pay you the other. - Now you've paid me. - Scotty, I heard Miss Vernon's in town. Have you seen her? - I did. She just walked down the street. - Thanks. - Who's that happy-looking pilgrim? - Alan Doran. He's engaged to Miss Vernon. - Oh? How long has he been in Soledad? - Oh, 'bout three months, I guess. He works for the Vernons, foreman. - A foreman? - First foreman I ever see without any calluses on his hands. - [ chuckles ] - Here. [ crickets chirping ] - Emmett. - What are you doing in Arlington, Voyle? - I was sent to get you. Doran heard about the Carter killing. - A lot of people heard about it. - He wants to see you. Now. - About Carter? - Says he didn't order the killing. - Maybe there's too many bosses in the Ruby Hills. - There'll only be one soon--Doran. And he's waiting. - I didn't order that Carter killing. Who did? - Reynolds. - What for? - For 1,000 bucks. - I got you that job with Reynolds for one reason-- so I'd know what was going on. - Reynolds wanted him killed. Maybe I wouldn't be on his payroll if I didn't follow his orders-- and then you wouldn't be getting the information you wanted. - Look... if Reynolds wanted Carter killed, there was a reason. And if that reason interferes with my plans, you won't be on anybody's payroll. What do you know about a man named Ross Haney? - Nothing. Heard the name someplace. That's all. Why? - He's in Soledad, looking for you. Says you killed a friend of his. - I don't know. I've killed a lot of people's friends. - I'll take care of Haney-- for nothing. - That's why you ain't a success. You work too cheap. - Haney's just a gunslinger looking for trouble. I know his kind. He'll move on. - Yeah? What if he doesn't? - Then he'll find trouble-- plenty of it. - Is that all you called this meeting for? - No. Payne and Reynolds are about to have a showdown. It's liable to happen any minute. We're gonna see that it does. - Oh, ho-ho. Well, I haven't seen you in a couple days. I thought maybe I'd lost my investment in you. - Let's go in and see if that waitress is as pretty as you say she is. - Well, you won't think so now. - No? Why not? - Well, you've seen Sherry Vernon. And after her, all women look washed out-- that is, until you forget her. - I don't plan to. - May. You know, you've got a fine order cut out for yourself, Haney. Sherry Vernon is always pleasant but never familiar. - Well, this is different. I'm gonna marry her. - May, I want you to meet, uh, Ross Haney. - You were right, Scotty. - He says he's gonna marry Sherry Vernon. - Isn't everybody? - No. Just me. - You know, Scotty, I think he might. - We'll have a couple of steaks and some coffee. Well, I think you convinced her. Now if you can do as well with Sherry Vernon, you got yourself a deal. It ain't the food that keeps this place open. It's May. - I'll get some coffee. - You know, my upper plate ain't gonna like this. But I've got tired of humoring it. - I rode out to Thousand Springs today, and then I rode up on the mesa, back of the Springs. - What did you find on the top? - Cabin that had been built there some years back. - You can hold an army off with that, if a man wanted to. - That's right. [ crickets chirping ] - May, bring me some bread and milk. It always ends up this way. What can I do for you, Mr. Reynolds? - Not you, him. I got a job for you, Haney. $100 a month and your keep. - I got a job. - Working for Payne? - Not working for him. Not working for you. I'm my own man. - When you're in Ruby Hills, you either work for me or you're against me. That makes you my enemy. - Seems to me you got enough enemies and deserve 'em. - You mind telling me why, Haney? - I'd be glad to. You came west from Missouri, started selling guns to the Indians. - That's a lie, Haney. - Don't make me kill you. Go ahead, Reynolds. You might make it. Now you can hear what I've got to say much better right where you are. So when you sold out the white settlers, you met up with Ben Carter's father in Julesburg. He wanted to form a partnership with you and work this valley. - That's none of your concern. It pays a man to keep his mouth shut. In fact, it might pay double what I figure to work for me. - To murder? Like you did your partner? You and he worked hard, didn't you-- planting trees, building a ranch house. And then somehow you ran into a bunch of Comanches and your partner was shot in the back. Comanches, Reynolds? Or was it that white Indian riding behind you? I'll tell you something else. I'm here in the Ruby Hills to stay. And you can tell Frank Emmett when he rides into this town that he can sell his saddle. 'Cause the next trip he makes is not gonna be on horseback. [ door closes ] - [ chuckles ] You know, I'm getting a lot more than my $1.00's worth. - That's right. I saw the whole thing from that window up there. - Has Reynolds heard about this yet? - No, but when he does come in town, he'll be looking for Payne. - And when they find each other, this town won't be worth living in. - I'll tell you all one thing right now. Andy Fielding and I are moving out of this town as fast as we can get the children packed. We've had enough of this. - Reynolds in town? - Not yet. From what I hear, he'll be in soon. - You've made an impression on everyone in Soledad, one way or the other. Don't you ever get through examining? - I was told you were a staked claim. I don't see any sign of the title. When a woman's engaged, she usually wears her proof, if she's proud of it. - You always say what's on your mind, don't you? - I like for people to know where I stand. - Where do you stand? - What do you mean? - Raleigh Burt was shot this afternoon. Two of Payne's men jumped him. He killed one. - That's not my problem. That's a job for the law. - Well, the last sheriff we had rode out of town, never came back. - Town's in pretty bad shape without the law. How does Burt's shooting concern you? - Burt's a good man, even though he works for Reynolds. - He is? I thought you said he was shot? - Wounded. He's still in town, I hear. I also hear that Payne's men will be in town to find him. - You hear a lot, don't you? - Good night. - Good night. What's she doing in town? - I sent for her. - But she wouldn't help Burt, huh? - How do you know that? - Because now you're about to ask me to help him. Why didn't you take him to her place? - Because she said the Vernon Ranch was the worst place you could take him. - Is he hurt bad? - He can ride, if we can get him out of here. He's in the cellar. - You mean here? - You know, Haney, there's not many good men in this town. And Raleigh Burt is one of 'em, even though he's on the payroll of Reynolds. And one of these days, you're gonna need a lot of good men. - You're a fool, Scotty. You're declaring yourself. - Sherry said if anybody could get him out of town, you could. - She said that, huh? I could take him to my cabin. - May. Haney's gonna get Burt out of town. - Where's his horse? - Stable behind my place. How we gonna get him to the stable? - I'll take care of that. You get him out of the cellar. We'll stall Payne. - I'm looking for Burt, Scotty. He's in town. He killed one of my men. - Way I heard it, Burt was jumped--two to one. Looks like he's a pretty good man to have come out alive. - Now, what part have you got in this, Haney? - Just curious. - You're too curious. This ain't none of your business. - If you want to take this boy home with you, you better tell him to keep his mouth shut. - Ah, forget it, Voyle. Get to looking for Burt-- in the kitchen, in the cellar. - I can save you a lot of trouble. Burt's not here. - Well, we'll just make real sure of that. Go on. - Hey, Voyle. Maybe Doran can help you if you need another hand. - Thank you. - What did you mean by that last remark? Doran doesn't work for me or Reynolds. - Maybe he works for himself. - I don't follow you. - Ask Voyle. Maybe he's got the answers. - Get to the point. - You wouldn't, by any chance, be paying Voyle to ride with Bob Vernon and Doran, now, would you? - I want to take a look in the office, Scotty. - Nobody there. [ door opens, closes ] - Get him out all right? - Yes, but he can't get far. He's lost a lot of blood. - Where's he hit? - In the shoulder. He's in back of the hotel behind the broken fence. [ crickets chirping ] - Burt. Burt, it's Haney. - Hold it. - Take it easy. May told me. Can you walk? - I don't know. I can try. - Stay here. I'll see what our chances are. - He might be in the alley. Help me over here. - Yeah. [ hooves clopping ] - Where you going? - After Burt. - Then we'll both go. There's a reward out for him. - Payne told you to stay here and watch for Reynolds. - Then we'll both stay. - Hey, Payne! Payne! Payne, Payne! - Yeah, what is it? - Reynolds and his men. - They're riding into town. - I'll be ready for 'em. - What about Raleigh Burt? - Well, forget him for now. - $100 for every dead Reynolds man. And $1,000 for Reynolds himself. Pass the word along. - I'm gonna crawl out of here and try to get us a horse. I think we've got a chance now. Stay here and be ready. - String out along the street and follow me. - Come on, men. - Payne? Payne? It's Reynolds. Payne... I hear you're looking for one of my men. Come on out, and we'll talk it over. - Here I am, Reynolds. Burt's in town. He's hiding out, and I want him. Now, you go on back home and let me find him, we'll consider the matter settled. If you don't, you and me can have it out right here and now. Now, which way do you want it? - I'm ready to talk. - He's backing down. Voyle! [ gunshot ] [ gunfire ] - Hold it, men! Hold it! [ gunshot ] Hold it! Come on over here! I want to talk to you. Now, listen to me. This feud's been going on for a long time, and now it's over. Payne and Reynolds are dead. There's no point in getting yourself killed. You're not getting paid for it. Now, I can sign you on. I'm making up a new payroll. And the drinks are on me. First come, first signed. [ indistinct conversations ] - I'll take care of Payne and Reynolds. Hey, Doug, Charlie, give me a hand. All right, men. Pick him up. - May, you're a fool. Don't go out there. - I have to find Haney. - If you go out there, somebody will stop you. - I'll tell 'em I'm on my way home. - Now, listen-- - Well, a girl can go home, can't she? - Stupid... - Burt? Haney? - Get back to the restaurant, May. - Where are you, Haney? - Here, here. - Shh, he saw me. - May! May... Who were you talking to? Haney, Burt, who? - Let me go. - Now we're in for it. They'll be swarming out of that saloon like rats. - Where did the shot come from? - Didn't come from up there. - You couldn't tell. Take a look around. - Ah, could have been some crazy galoot. - May... - It's Haney. We've got to keep 'em out of this alley. String along with me, will you, Scotty? - Come on. - Give me your arm. - May and Scotty are trying to stall 'em. Maybe we can get a couple of horses now. - [ panting ] There are two men fighting in the alley. I'm not sure-- - Go on, go on. Who was it? Where? - In the alley between the buildings. - I heard the shot. May was on her way home. - Shut up, Scotty, and let her tell it. Who was it? Was it Haney? Could you tell? - I-I couldn't see. - You men, go search the alley. Now, go ahead. What did you see? - Well, it was too dark for me to see anything, but... - Search the alley. - I'll take that way. - If you see 'em, give a holler. [ indistinct shouting ] Some of you, go that way. - Nothing down this way over here. - Or back here. - Let's get out. - Nobody back there. - We couldn't find anybody in the alley, boss. - We'll keep on looking. - Well... you don't seem to be very sure about what you saw, do you? - Well, I-I'm not. I'm not! - Now, don't worry about it. It will be all right, May. - Coffee? - Thanks. - How's the shoulder? - Better. All I worry about now is my neck. - Well, we're both big boys, dad. You don't have to worry about that. You served your purpose. You were used to set off the explosion. How did you happen to walk into that setup yesterday? - Well, I met Bob Vernon. He told me there was a message for me over at the hotel. When I started over there, a couple of Payne's men jumped me. - Vernon got his orders from Doran. Doran staged that bloodbath in town last night, sat on the sidelines and watched, and then moved in and took over. I knew about both Payne and Reynolds before I came to Soledad, but I didn't know about Doran. - Nobody did. He's practically a stranger around here. - I wonder who else he's used. - Doran and Vernon's sister were supposed to get married. - Yeah. I know. - How friendly you think that makes them? - [ sighs ] There's one way to find out. Ask. - What do you want here, Haney? - Are you working for Doran or is Doran working for you? - I don't know what you're talking about. - You helped set up the Payne-Reynolds killings, didn't you? - I wasn't even in town. - You sent Raleigh Burt to pick up a message. - Payne and Reynolds were bound to kill themselves sooner or later. - Why did you help make it sooner? - That kind of question's gonna buy you the same answer that Burt got. - Morning, Haney. - Good morning. - Your fighting hours start early. - I find I have to get up pretty early in this town to stay alive. - Must have been a pretty rough night in Soledad. - It was. Now I see why you didn't want Raleigh Burt out here. - That's right. We didn't want that kind of action around the house. - But you do like having Doran around. - Doran's my foreman. - He was your foreman. Last night's killings got him his promotion. Now you're not marrying the foreman. You're marrying the boss. - There are a lot of things you don't understand. And a lot I don't. - Why you so interested in everybody and in everything? - I'm figuring on settling down here. - Well, now that the town's cleaned up, do you think they'll stand for the son of an outlaw? - I've owed him that ever since the day I first met him. You tell him he was right. My father was an outlaw. Or maybe you already knew that. So I have to be like my father. You have to be like your brother. I've made up my mind. Now you make up yours. - What happened to him? - He spoke out of turn. - I just saw Haney leave here. Did they fight? - You can call it that. It was short. - What's bothering you? - I heard about last night. - I've got a lot of explaining to do. - You could never explain. - What's Haney been telling you? - Nothing. - Then he probably didn't tell you that he's gonna hang for murder, along with Raleigh Burt. - And Frank Emmett? - And several others. I doubt that Haney will be easy to find when he learns that I've sent for the Marshal. - You sent for the Marshal? - He's coming in from Arlington today. I want to make Soledad a safe place to live. - Somehow, I never thought you would be concerned in saving a town. - Why do you think I came here? - I know why you came here-- first to blackmail us and then to take over my ranch. You came here to save Soledad for yourself. - I saved your brother. - My brother isn't worth saving. And neither are you. - Vernon. You heard all this? - You sent for the Marshal. [ chuckles ] That's pretty funny. - I did send for the Marshal. - Now you wish you hadn't? - There's a rope in Ju?rez waiting for you. - I know all that. - I'm taking the men to Silvertown. - The old--the old ghost town? - Yes. Can't operate here. - On account of Haney. Nothing must happen to him here, I can see that. - I'm bringing Frank Emmett back. We'll wait in Silvertown. - I'll go with you? - No. You stay right here. You got a job to do. When you do it, then you come to Silvertown. - Hi, May. Where's Scotty? - He's been in and out all day. - Well, I'll wait. - If you want coffee, this is the place. If you want trouble, you better try the saloon. That's where Frank Emmett is. - I'll have coffee now, half a cup. - How's Raleigh? - Coming along. - Quite a bit of celebrating going on down the way. Something's going on, something bad. Folks are still leaving town. Pretty soon, there won't be anybody left except Doran and his hired gunmen. - And then they'll still just start it all over again. - And who's going to stop them? - Thanks for the coffee, May. - Ross... I've been watching Emmett. - Still in the saloon? - He's sitting there, watching them batwing doors. He wouldn't have a chance to get through 'em. [ footsteps approaching ] - Drink... Then draw. [ gunshots ] [ horse neighs ] Where's Burt? - He said he'd be back after a while. - How did you know how to find me? - You can find anything if you want it bad enough. You taught me that. - What do you want? - You. - What about Doran and your brother? - They're not important now. It took me a long time to make up my mind about a lot of things. I know now what my brother really is. - Doran? - Does my being here answer that? - You made your decision. - No matter what happens, I want to be with you. - Come here. - So...I'm leaving. - You can tell Doran he'll have one less man to hang now when the Marshal gets here-- Frank Emmett. - I'm not gonna tell him anything. I'm through with Doran. - I don't believe you. - I didn't expect you to. - Must be some reason. 'Fraid of him? - Maybe. Maybe not. - Haney isn't. - He should be. - Why? - I know you don't think much of me. That's not important anymore. - What is important? - Someday I'm gonna prove to you that you're wrong about a lot of things. - Such as? - Such as your not believing I'm through with Doran. - Go on. - Doran's not gonna stop at anything to take over Soledad and everybody in it. Haney won't be the only one killed. Anybody else that stands in his way will be killed, too. You're right. I am afraid of Doran. If I wasn't, I could stop him right now. - How could you stop him? - Doran's meeting his men in the old ghost town between here and Arlington. They're gonna ride back this way, and when they do, there won't be anything left in their path. So I'm leaving. I don't know what you're gonna do, but if I were you, I just wouldn't sit around here and wait. Bye. - She believe you? - She believed me. So will Haney when she tells him. [ horses galloping ] - Ross! - I told you to stay in Soledad. - Is it safer there? - I don't know, Sherry. I don't know. Go on back to Soledad and wait for me. - No. I'll stay right here. Ross... - Yeah? - Be careful. - I got your message, Vernon. - I thought you'd come. - What do you want? - You filed claim to a Thousand Springs. You own it now. It's all legal, isn't it? - That's right. Land and cattle aren't any good without water, are they? You spent three whole months lying, cheating, conniving to get Payne and Reynolds to wreck themselves. You want to know something? All that land and all those head of cattle don't mean a thing. 'Cause you've got to do business with me. - Oh, no. You got to do business with me. I want that title. - That water belongs to the people of Soledad, people who want to build a town, not wreck it. - You're gonna sign that title to me, Haney. - That's all? - That's all. Make up your mind. - Haney... - You'll never make it. [ gunshot ] - You take Doran. I'll take the others. [ gunfire ] - Get their guns. - Deputy, come here. - [ sighs ] Guess I didn't have time to leave much of a monument, did I? - You've got your monument right here. - Your father will be real proud of you, son. [ exhales ] If I see him... I'll...I'll tell him-- [ gasps ] - You were wrong back in Arlington, Garvey. - Wrong about Tom? - Yeah. - I'm glad. - He told me about Doran's men being here in this ghost town. That's how I knew Bob Vernon was lying. Scotty and the boys decided I needed help. - That's right, Marshal. - I'll get a full report from you later on. - All right. Soledad was his kind of town. See he gets back there, will you? Thanks, Sherry.
