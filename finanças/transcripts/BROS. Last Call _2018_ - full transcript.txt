- When you hear the first computer, fax machine, female lawyer. Where do you think they're all from? The Silicon valley? Perhaps even New York. No, this is Iowa. Home of the only division 1A football stadium named after an African-American, Jack Trice. Who attended Iowa State University in the 20s. He was the second African-American competing in college football at a major university. Who's the first? Frank Holbrook, who played for the. University of Iowa a decade earlier. During the Civil War, 76,534 lowans served in The Union. No other state had a higher percentage of its male population serve. This is Waterloo. Waterloo, Iowa. This city, with the greatest tractors ever made. This is East High. Record for the longest football winning streak in the state. Strangely enough, the record for the longest losing streak, too. But whatever. Hey, Cedar Falls, suck my dick from behind for pointing that out in the first movie. Waterloo West High. The high school of the greatest wrestler of all time, Dan Gable. Waterloo is the home of the greatest American Navy family, the Sullivans. The Sullivan brothers all died on the same ship in the South Pacific during World War II. This is a story that inspired the movie, Saving Private Ryan. But my town of Waterloo, that's where you're gonna get the real American Experience. A large glass of scotch, plenty of great food, and genuine conversation. - American Pie was awesome. - I can't believe the kid from Rookie of the Year got Tara Reid. - Harold was not aware of this. Who was the kid from Rookie of the Year? - Thomas Ian Nicholas, if I ever meet him, I'm gonna tell him The Floater was shit. - Tara Reid is hot. - I like the part where the dude put his dick in the pie. - How do you know he's Jewish? - Because his dad is Eugene Levy, Jew. - You come off so antisemitic. You need to work on that. - The intern Clinton nailed was a Jew. - You know, in 20 years, our presidents, they'll be married to models and plowing porn stars. - You Neanderthals. - Since your parents divorced, your weekends with your dad have been great. - Thank you Father, for allowing us to watch R rated movies. - Pisses Mom off, which is funny. - I prefer American Beauty over American Pie. It will win an Oscar. - I would rather see a Jew screw a pie over a plastic bag in the wind any day. - Dad keeps asking me how many times the new boyfriend comes, comes about three times a week. Mom comes about seven or eight. Quit being such a fag, Dad. Move on, get a chick, sell some more Saturns or something. - If you ever need to talk about your feelings, after the divorce, Harold is a good listener. - Feelings? I have two Christmases now, you cock munchers. - Hey, where's Taylor? - He's hanging with his girl he met. She's here for the summer. - What is this, Grease? ♪ Those summer, nights ♪ - I prefer Grease 2. Much better movie. Musical scenes, way better. Best bowling scene in film history. - Taylor would sell out his buddies for a chick any day. Pervert, Dee tried to tell him to keep his hands to himself. - I will wait for the right girlfriend. Harold is classy. I want a lady with that same standard. - Fag. - No way Richard Gere's going to rescue you if you're a hooker. - Yeah, I guess he did make out with her. You don't kiss a hooker on the mouth. - No. - They'll bite off the tip of your tongue. - They'll bite right on. - Like that shame on guy. - Wait, Sham-Wow guy. - You know the guy from the infomercial with the shammy. - Yeah. He made out with a hooker. And she bit off the tip of his tongue. - Holy shit! - Bit it right off. You don't kiss a hooker on the mouth. - No shit. And Richard Gere gives her money to go shopping? - No, no. - He would've taken her in an alley, bent her over a dumpster, and said, "yeah, take that pig!" - Now that's a movie I would totally go, I would pay money to see that. - Yeah, you we think we're above men in this area, but we are just as depraved. How many copies of Fifty Shades of Gray were sold? Three blockbuster films. - Oh, my God. Honestly, I mean, I'd rather see that rich guy work over that chick, than watch the fucking Notebook. - I would rather have my Catholic grandmother catch me watching hardcore gay porn than to watch the fucking Notebook. - Gay porn is the best, though. That's a real romance movie. - Well, no, watching some twink get turned out by a couple of hairy bears, hot. - Yeah, take that pig. - Hey, where's Tanner? - I don't know, man. I don't think his fiance likes him hanging out with me. - Why? - She treats me like I'm from Marshal Town, man. I'm gonna take him out to the Tiger's Den. He's gonna get hopped up on crystal meth, take a swing at a stripper. - Well, she did have to pick you guys up last week at four in the morning. - It's different man. Dave's stash makes some killer Vegas bombs. Look at you man. Maybe you're the issue. Maybe he can't come here because of you. You look like the devil wears Tommy Bahama. - Hey bro, this shit gets me anything I want. And you're no peach yourself either. - I know. A grown man wearing Justin Bieber jacket. Maybe she's a little bit right. But still, fuck her. - Dude, you tell him to tell her he's at the real library. - That's what I'm thinking. Maybe you she'll wind up allowing him to come out. Maybe he's gonna go and say he's gonna I don't know, get like a boxcar kids novel, or Sweet Valley High. Hey, have we had this conversation before? - Matt, we have this conversation every time. - Tanner's fiance's a bitch. - Major bitch. She's says that Tanner can't come down here anymore because she doesn't want him hanging around. Mr. Lance. - Oh, she said Jeff Lance is a misogynist. - What a dumb clam. I don't even know gymnastics. - No, dude. That's a contortionist. - What the hell's a misogynist? - It's a man who's prejudice against women, thinks that they're inferior. - Doesn't she know that I'm Jeff Lance? I love women. - That's right man. You love women. You're Jeff Lance. You don't treat women like an object. They treat you like an object. - I know. I'm actually sensitive. I have feelings. I want to be held and listened to like a puppy. - You know what, I'm gonna text Tanner, tell him hey, tell your fiance that Jeff says misogynists is an awfully big word for such a little girl. And send. - Dude, that's something a misogynist would say. - Exactly. - Funny, bro. - Don't worry about it. She doesn't it to everyone. - Yeah, she calls everyone sexist, racist, homophobe. You name it. - Small minds do it all the time. Sexist. Homophobe. Racist. Vocal trump cards for the idiots. - You are a little antisemitic at times. - Don't worry, Matt, the Jews will not replace you. - Hey. Got a text from Tanner. His fiance says she will let us come over, but for just one drink. And we have to have it in the driveway. - In the driveway? It's like on King of the Hill, Dammit Bobby. The Fiance is such a bitch. - Yeah man, I don't know what you mean man. You know what, fuck it. Let's have shots. - Shots. - Shots. You ever know about Toby Huss? Actor from Marshalltown? Played the voices of Kahn and Grampaw Hill. So anyway, he was up for the part of Mr. Miyagi, and he showed up to the first audition piss drunk and did the most racist, asian voice he possibly could, and got brought back for the second audition. In his second audition, he came in sober, lost the part. - So dude, where you headed? Waterloo? - Sierra Falls.

On stage right now, Pamela the Punisher poet. The only dominatrix poet to ever make it. And, her sidekick, our good friend Sam the Slave. - Ode to the little piggy, dirty, nasty little piggy. I'm going to make you mine so get on your knees and whine, you nasty swine. I am Pamela, the Punisher poet. And you're just my little piggy and everyone's going to know it. I am the only dominatrix poet to ever make it so get on your knees you nasty little pig and take it. - I love Pamela the Punisher. I love poetry. You girls have boyfriends? - Yes. Fantastic. I love you Pamela the Poet Punisher. - Rutro. Where's Scooby and the gang? - Solve any mysteries lately? - No, not, not today. Why? - Is your mom picking you up from little league later? - I'm in a league. - Is your priest still molesting you? - You look like Lance Armstrong without the roids. - You look like Tom Hanks and the end of Philadelphia. - You look like Chaz Bono in a fun house mirror. - Sam. What's up man, how's it going? - Good. Yeah, could I get a scotch please? - Yeah, put that one on me. - Classy as always, sir. Dude, how's it going man? Where's Tanner at? - He's with his fiance, man. - Well that's what happens, right. You get older. You get kids. Got a nice wife, I guess. Or you can just be the guy drinking alone at the bar. - Yeah. - Right. - Yeah, yeah. Apparently right now, he's two knuckles deep in a game of scrabble with his finance. - Scrabble. Don't you have to know words for scrabble? - Yeah. You know that guy's just playing idiotic stuff. He's probably sitting there bored making houses and stuff like that. - Fucking lame crap. - Idiot. He's gonna play like this, they, them, it, as, and, an, and then do the D. And then yeah, you know he's gonna get to there and have like the wrong one. Like he's gonna go ahead and say ah, this means they are, right. They are, right. He's gonna be asking. - His fiance has to be having the worst time right now. - Well, woo. Look what he just played. Actually, Tanner is playing scrabble with is fiance with a bunch of her friends. She spelled Fount, which earned her 24 points. She was quite proud. Tanner had a word too. His fiance kept pestering him on his vocabulary all night. Starts with a Q. That earned him triple letter score. So guess what Tanner's word is. I'll give you a few hints. Muff grunt, box burp, sliz sneeze, womb wheeze, cunt cough. That's right. Tanner's word is Queef. And if you're still lost, Google pussy fart. Queef earned Tanner 63 points total on the word and gave him the lead. His finance was pissed. But her Ceder Falls friends were impressed, and also laughing so hard that Tanner's finally in with them. Just goes to show you everyone comes together at a campground over a twat tune. - Triple letter score on the letter Q, nice. - Nice. He's putting that extra chromosome to use. - I'll drink my scotch to that. - I'm telling you guys, Jeff Lance is my real father. I know it. - He went in with your mom when he was 12 years old, you do realize this. - That's what I'm saying. She had Jeff in class when he was 12. - That means your mom's a child molester. - Yes, but my real father's a stud. - Well, it makes sense. You do like raw dogging the strange. - Patrick Plumly. He owns On The Rocks, a bar with over 15 different Moscow mules, eight craft beers on tap, and even more bottled and canned. A place like On The Rocks is a staple in the Waterloo nightlife. Come have some of the best drinks, cocktails, beers in the whole Ceder Valley all while taking in some artwork of a vintage Waterloo. The Dipshit Twins, the smartest guys in the valley. They received the highest marks at Iowa State University. Later, they attended both Columbia and Harvard. Inspired by their heroes, Neil Degrasse Tyson and Carl Sagan. But like any other genius, if you want to throw them off, get them on a sex topic. It totally throws a genius off. Einstein can come up with a theory of relativity, but ask that non-practicing Jew krout to find the G spot on a woman, and he will be more shaken than Richard Spencer asking for directions in a KFC on the southside of Chicago. - You know, I was thinking on the topic of black holes again. - Here we go. - We do not know what laws of physics apply within a black hole. We just don't. We're applying standard laws of physics, but they can't apply there. They can't. - Again, the standard laws of physics can apply to a black hole if there is any presence of something here on earth such as gravity. - Gravity. Oh, so that's what Google was talking about when I looked it up earlier. - Yes, the same gravity that takes this beautiful dart to the black hole of that gaping bullseye. Right in the center. Don't look. - Well, - Jesus Christ. What in the world of Breaking Bad biology did I walk in on? - Matt. - You nerds talking about. Black holes again? - Just because we identify as nerds doesn't mean you can call us nerds. We can call each other nerds. You can't call us nerds. Nerd. - Hey, nerd. - Hey. - Yes, we're talking about black holes. - Man, you guys talk about black holes more than Robert Pinero. - Hold on. He's doing that comedy thing again. Because Robert De Niro, Bobby as I call him, he likes black women. So that is funny. - Bobby of Niro likes black. - Jesus guys. Seriously. But I'll play along. - Oh. - So, let's just say the guy particle accelerator and taken out all these mini black holes. - Yes, you're speaking my language. - They go ahead and toss us into the Mandela Effect. Mandela Effect. The Mandela Effect refers to an enlarged number of people share a false memory, originally attributed to the existence of multiple universes. Are we currently residing in it? - Let's see. Answer the question. - Bernstein. I guess you could be a possibility. Next question. - It could be a possibility. - But. - If only you were to believe in alternate timelines. Or I don't know, maybe something like alternate universes. A bubble universe. - I get it. Like Rick and Morty, right. - No, I don't like Rick and Morty. It's too smart for me. Make my brain hurt. - Pickle. - Pickle dick. Ow. - It's pickle Rick. I got another question for you guys. You think - because. - Yes. - These black holes opening, toss us into an alternate universe within ourselves that we actually have non binary people. People who do not identify as either gender, nor masculine, nor feminine. That they see neither of them. That however they exist outside the binary, and outside the cis normativity. I'm telling you some people do not see gender, but just see who they actually are as a person. - See people. I've been to 17 different colleges. - Dizzy. Matt, what the fuck are you talking about man? - Yeah. What are you saying? - I'm just saying these people don't see gender. - You're hurting Dipshitowits one. - Shut up, Dipshitowits two. - How can you not see gender? That's all you can see when you're doing it. Look, hey, hey, hey. Honk, honk. Honk, honk. - It's all you can see. It's all you can see. - Hey, hey, gender, gender, gender, gender. Hey, hey, hey. - Let's put it, hey, hey. - Hey. - I'm doing both parts. Hey. What? - You're gonna get us kicked out again. - Sorry. Sorry. - What are you gonna do? Oh yeah, here's a big seven inch dark and red veiny, sweaty, smelly non-binary. - It's my big, huge, two inches, give or take veiny. Looks almost like... - Big, huge, two inches? - Go. - I mean, I don't think they see it kind of that way boys. - Well you sometimes you need a microscope, but you can see it that way. - You can see it. I've looked. Scientific curiosity. Nothing weird. Look, Matt, let's put it in dummy language. - Yeah, we're the Dipshits. Sure. - There's no denying dick. - Yeah. - There's no denying dick. There's no denying dick. There's no denying dick. There's no denying dick. There's no denying dick. There's no denying dick. There's no denying dick. There's no. - You know what. - What? - Let's go home. - Yeah. - Get the whiteboard out, put some fricking Windex on it. And then we're gonna figure this out for once and for all. - Yeah Matt. You're such a fricking A-hole. Pardon my language, but we're trying to go on solve the straight dairy problem. Now you got me all twisted up. Now we have to fricking solve non-binary. - Computer scientists. Let's go. - A couple of science nerds, they're not very PC. Indepedent film. They must have meant Independent film. The Mandela Effect. But an Independent film set in Waterloo, Iowa named Bros. Oh man, that's got to suck. - You running off my customers again? - Come on man, they were just gonna drink up my fucking favorite scotch. - Doesn't matter. - Tell you what, I'm gonna drink the majority of that bottle in there anyways. And they were probably gonna have a bunch of waters. It won't matter. They're science dorks. I'm a drunk. I pay more. - I love alcoholism. - Hey, hey, the Waterloo Manati meeting just let out? - Matt, good to see you. - Good seeing you. - Where's your buddy, Tanner? - He's out with his fiance tonight. - Yep. That happens when you get older. People, they get married. They have kids. Be happy for your friend. - Yeah, speaking of which, he's playing scrabble with her. Check out the word he played. - Oh, yeah. That's nice placement there on that Q. Triple letter score. 63 points. Very nice. - Yeah. I hate drinking alone. - Eat your bread with joy and drink your wine with a merry heart, for god has already approved what you do. - That's beautiful. Who's that? Luke Bryant? Kanye West? - It's Ecclesiastes nine seven. It's from the bible. - Yeah. I always try to give musicians way too much credit. - Let me ask you something, what have you done so far today? - Well, it started off. I had some shots with Jeff Lance at the Library. I went and saw pro-wrestling at the Five Sullivan Center. And went and saw Pamela The Punisher Poet next door. It's been pretty cool. - All that in the course of one Saturday afternoon in the Cedar Valley. You know, the Douist define grace not so much by the words that you say, but by your actions, your movements, how you live life. You have more wealth in these few city blocks than most people have anywhere in the world. Where else, other than maybe Las Vegas or something can you get a glass of scotch that full? Be happy for your friends, for they come and go. You know they'll always be those children and those wives out there. Be happy for them too because this too may come for you someday. - Yeah. What if it doesn't? - Well then you're just another old guy at a bar. But see that's okay too. You need to cherish your memories, enjoy your scotch, and remember the five Sullivan brothers. They would have loved to be able to come back to this town and enjoy it the way that you have. - How'd you get so wise? - I come from Oelwein, Iowa. Oh hey, I have two tickets to the court games. Starts in about 15 minutes. If you can find somebody to go with you, great. If not, then you just enjoy your evening. - Thanks man. I always appreciated our friendship. - Take care. Finish that scotch. - The Cedar Valley court games. Waterloo's Midwest professional basketball team. Actually, the Midwest professional basketball league champions. - Speaking of broke, do you have enough money to finish paying for your haircut? - I see, it's cool, it's cool. It's hard out here man. - You look like Raggedy Anne after a house fire, man. - People's hair, I mean one more hair strand falls out your hair, man, you're gonna look like broke Bruce Willis or something. I'm just saying. - Jersey Shore reject. You look like old Asians. - Speaking of that, you sure look like you came off the gas golf course seven. - I did, I see you dad there. - Speaking of rejects, like your hairline's been rejecting your forehead a little bit. I don't know what's going on. - Your hairline look like a fundraiser. I'm sorry. - You guys are black. - You kind of look like an Oreo. - A broreo. - A broreo. I like that. I like that, let's toast to that right there. - Bros for life. - Bros for life. - So I was thinking, and I think I might like the sound of some little feet pitter pattering. I think maybe we should start a family. - Oh my god. I love being your wife. I would make such a great mom. I would love to have a little boy or girl with you. - Okay. I'll throw away the condoms. You start taking your temperature and charting your days. And I'll triangulate the insemination for the best possible outcome. - The way you sound it, it's so dirty. I love it. - Black Hawk county seat was originally in Cedar Falls. - Yeah, and then some Waterloo residents went over and seized the documents and brought them back to Waterloo. - Wait, is this a story where they threw eggs at each other? - Yeah, they called it the egg war. - Hard boiled. Just like city councils in these towns. - Or over easy, like the Cedar Valley women. - So according to this, we conceived on the weekend of the 11th and the 12th. - Hey, that was the weekend I was out of town at my nana's funeral. - Oh my god. Sorry. - It's okay. I fucked somebody else that weekend too. - C'est la vie. - Sera, sera. - Mom, you got to stop hitting on guys my age. Stop flirting with my guy friends. - You know people think we could actually be sisters. - You slow down. You're way too much. - I am a cougar. It's our time now. I will not slow down. It's MILF time. - Gross. - Your little friend, Jake, didn't think so. - This is Elias, a good Christian boy. Drank way too much one night. Actually, he went on an entire weekend bender. Now, he's in alcoholic's anonymous. So we refer to him as. AA Elias. - Shit this shit's man. Why don't they fix this shit, dude? Who gives a shit. - Hey, Jorge. - What you want, dude? - You know I'm really concerned about you man. I'm really concerned about your health. Hwy don't you take a look at this. Really could help you out. - You think? - Yeah man. It helped me. - Whatever dude. Go away dude, I'm drinking. - Alright, just think about it, man. - Yeah whatever dude. Go fuck yourself.

Can't hang out with me. - He found someone tighter than you, huh. - Yeah, I guess in a way. - In a way? Really? - Yeah. Who's fucking push light is that? - That's that milk weed, Tyler of the tool. - Oh Jesus Christ. Was diet mountain dew too spicy? - For that milk weed motherfucker, maybe. - Oh yeah. Extra cheese was a good call. It's a two flusher, baby. Pouring one out for your dead homies over there? You guys both have a grinder. That's how you guys met. That's awesome. Good for you guys. You guys are a beautiful couple. I like the melting pot kind of situation going on here. - Hey, at least I get swiped right, motherfucker. Hey, what's with the jacket? Were you worried about the Jews replacing you? - You couldn't replace me. I look like if Adolph Hitler could perfectly design somebody. A genetically modified boy band member basically. - Yeah, the Richard Spencer Five. I've heard of them. - You're just like my uncle. You went south of the border. You got a nice Hispanic wife. You're like the guy from Modern Family. That's awesome. - You're adorable. - That's like your mom said. She thinks I'm real cute. She put me up in her big strong Mexican arms, like a big bundle of fruit. Just picked me up. - Hey, where's your dipshit friend at? Tyler? - Pulling doubles over at the golf course, man. Golf pro. Making that good money. He's got a kid on the way. He fucks girls, unlike you guys. - Putting. The short game. Well, half the game actually. You master this, and I think I see a little green jacket in your future. But, but you got to eye on the ball and then put through to the hole. Through to the hole. But, you got to focus. Buddy. Focus. - Hey, I thought that was a baby ruth in Caddyshack. - Yeah, but all they had was snickers. - Hey, no more Caddyshack references. - But man, orange balls. Hey Wayne, this is a swanky joint. Go tell him you're Jewish. - No more Caddyshack references. No more Caddyshack references. I'm fucking serious. - Oh baby. This is a big one. - Alright, don't count that one. That was interfered with. - The whole world needs ditch diggers too. - What'd I say about Caddyshack references? - What's the matter? I just want to bring you a present. - No more. Caddyshack references. - Hey, that's from Caddyshack two. - Yeah, it's from Caddyshack two, bra. - Shit man. The last time I saw you, the night in Cedar Falls with Heather. - Yet that girl talks about how small my dick is. Like you're six foot four, everything looks that small compared to that. Come on. - You ever notice when she gets mad, she kind of looks like William Defoe? - Oh dude, it's like kind of like seeing my stepdad. It's crazy. Like the guy that got shot by fucking Jake Taylor from Major League in Platoon, you know what I'm talking about. - Yeah dude. Oh my god. Was she on the rescue in the Boondock Saints? - Yeah. Born on the fourth of July. - You two are peas in a pod. What are you, a fucking shake swords together sometimes. - That's not a bad idea? - Yeah man. Hey, you got to have somebody from a movie talk shit about your dick, who would it be? - Oh man, probably Hannibal Lector, man. He'd be like go into great detail about it, and then like snack that shit up with some fava beans. What about you? - Weirdly, Cruella de Vil. - 101 Dalmatians. - Yeah. Yeah, she'd talk shit about it, she'd still see the beauty in it. She'd just have to find a 100 more and fashion it in to a fashionable jacket. - A nice little dick coat. - Yeah, who wouldn't wear a dick skinned jacket? - I would look good in a dick coat. - That jacket is tighter than dick skin. - Absolutely. - So, fuck it. You want to go to Lava Lounge? I'll buy you a scotch. $12, the good kind. - Trailer Park Boys, nice. - Nice. - Well, it looks like I'm Julien on this one, cause I'm taking my drink with me. - It's about to fucking time. - Have a good one. Adios amigo. - Yeah, fuck yourself. - No, C3-PO has a silver leg. - Mandela Effect. - No, what. No, no, no, no, no. C3-PO is gold and Han did the Castle Run in 12 parsecs. Duh. - Pretty sure it was 14. - He told Chewy that he rounded down in Solo. - Either way, it's still impressive. - So, is Rey Han and Leia's kid? - How the hell would Luke and Leia not sense that? I mean these jedis are unreal. Leia can Mary Poppins through the vacuum of space, but she can't keep track of her damn kids. - There's no way that Rey is their kid anyway. Han and Leia, no, there's no way. No. - Jedi's are shitty parents. - Do you think that at like another bar in this town, there are girls talking about Star Trek like we're talking about Star Wars. - No way. - Yeah, Star Trek is dumb. - You're right. - You can have your Captain Pikard. You can have your Captain Kirk, but I'm after that Spock. There's a reason for live long and prosper. I'd put a smile on that Vulcan's face. - I understand that. But I want Mr. Chekov as I want to make him my first. You know them virgins. I want to take him boldly where no man has gone before. - Girl. - You know in can do a little. - Only you girl. - I'm telling you, that's the way it's supposed to be. - Cheers. - You know, I gotta say, Rent by far is the greatest musical ever created. It has heart. It's visceral. And it just moves you in every way possible. And also, it really hits home with all my gay friends and what they have to endure. - Les Miserable is the greatest musical of all time. It digs into the human spirit, the struggle. They yearn to be part of a higher power, and the grace of humanity. - Cats is the best. I just love it. Cute little cats running around. And they don't make me sneeze like real cats. - The Music Man, a light hearted musical set in Iowa. It saw the best production of it at the Cedar Falls Community Theater at the. The Waterloo Community Playhouse also had a superb production of it. - You guys are all wrong. I'm not trying to be a dickhead but, awful selections. Greese 2 is profoundly better than everything you guys have mentioned. You can roll your eyes, but it really is. You're just gonna have to revisit it. The Music Man? I don't mean any disrespect, I just, that's like, it's child's play for grandparents. It makes lowans seem like frumpy fools that can't spot a fraud a half a cornfield away. It's not any good. Cats. Cats. I don't have enough scotch for Cats. Rent man. Rent's insufferable. It just, like I get it. Like I understand the struggle. Totally sympathize with the gay community in New York City during Aids and persecution, living in weirdly shitty apartments. But really all it did was enable white sorority sisters to slaughter more Karaoke songs. I can't, I can't. Cats? Les Mis. I mean I don't hate it. I like Anne Hathaway in the movie. It's pretty great. But Jean Valjean is not and will never be. Cool Rider. In Greese 2, Michael comes to America with a dream. He makes his money writing essays for the less fortunate folks at his school. And he saves his money and he builds a motorcycle from scratch. A cool rider was needed. He built it from scratch. He repurposed these parts and he built them into something stronger, faster, and just beautiful. I don't know what else you would want. It's the American dream in musical form. Michelle Phieffer needed hell on wheels and by god, Michael bird hot. It also has the best bowling scene in cinematic history. It's way better than that trite gooey Beatles karaoke movie across the universe. - Seriously, Harris. That's the best you can come up with? - Please I, please, I prefer Harold. - I prefer Harris. - Okay. - A couple reasons why Greese 2 is shit. First of all, Michelle Phieffer sounds like she's got a dead cat stuck in her throat. Her singing is atrocious. - And yet she persevered. - That was easily the worst movie she's ever been in. Secondly, there's a production going on right now called 13. These kids are in junior high and they're putting on something better than these 30 year olds could. Last, these four musicals were on a stage, been on Broadway. Greese 2 has only been in theaters and has never won an award. - Well, better is the local theater. They chose to do Greese instead of the wrong one. If they would have got their heads out of their asses, they would have picked the right one, they would have found a cool rider and Harold would have obliged. - So what are you drinking there? - Young lady, I am not drinking anything. I am experiencing this single malt scotch. - You know, every time you drink scotch, it makes me really frisky. - Well I do suppose that the experience is different for everyone. - Well what are you doing later? - Young lady, must I inform you that I'm wearing my purity ring. - Why are you wearing a purity ring? - Because purity rings are so cool. - Cousin Harold. Are you doubting the coolness of my purity ring? - Well if your ear wolf hat is an indication, yes, I am. I've decided that purity rings are no longer. - Well then they are no longer hip for the Oliver. Young lady may entice away. - Do you want to experience my place or yours later? - Oh, Oliver does not want to wait that long. How about out back behind the dumpster? - Dumpster fucking? Yeah. - Oliver, please. - Oh cousin Harold, I suppose you're right. How about we go back to my place and we experience a bottle of single malt scotch and I will show you my huge vinyl collection. - Okay. - My work here is done. - Thank you, cousin Harold. Thank you. - Did she say dumpster fucking? - I believe they said dumpster fucking. Have you ever dumpster fucked? - I've never had a dumpster fuck, but I've had a handjob behind the Tasty Freeze one time. - That sounds like you. - You how I feel about those tractor shots. It's just kind of like, actually that guy up there on the TV. He seems like a guy who probably put himself in his own movies. - Yeah, multiple movies on the same subject. - Always in the same bars, in the same locations, and it's always the same gay dick jokes. - Constantly. Because the only thing this guy finds funny is dick jokes after a life of touring and bar hopping. - Drinking nothing but scotch. Pretty sure it just runs through his veins and he just like pisses straight scotch. - Burns all the time. You can never tell when he's got the clap. - I mean I'm sure he's got some good drugs for that. But three movies. Fuck. Kevin Smith won't even make a third Clerks. - Definitely not. - Strip clubs, pornography shops, come on Boss. There's got to be something else out there. - What would you suggest I do? - Christian bookstores. - Boss. This is the Boss. He owns a strip club and an adult bookstore in town. This guy's former boss. The Adult Shop Mop. - Okay, the idea of being in business is to stay in business. You realize that, right. Hey, you're a good kid. Everybody likes you, Elias. You know they call you AA Elias now cause of that weekend. But that's okay. AA's probably good. Alcoholics anonymous works for some people and seems to work pretty well for you. And that's good. Let me pose something to you. Imagine there's a good Christian man. He goes to church every Wednesday and Sunday. Goes to bible study, a great man, very faithful. He's driving down the road one day on his way to a bible study, soup kitchen, what have you. He gets a tightness in his chest. It's pains in his arms. Realizes he's having a heart attack, pulls off to the very first place he could find to seek out help. He dies on the floor of that business. Say it's my adult bookstore or one of my strip clubs. The news will read 77 year old man dies of a heart attack at 10:00 AM in the morning at an adult bookstore or strip club. You're automatically gonna think this man is bad. Let's go the other side. Imagine there is an awful guy. A guys that goes to my strip clubs all the time. He's at my adult bookstores, complete porn hound. A complete reprobate. A drunk. A whore monger. He's driving down the road one day. It's a tightness in his chest. Pains in his arms. Knows he's gonna have a heart attack. Pulls off to the very first place he can find to seek out help, and it's a church. The news will read 77 year old man dies of a heart attack at 10:00 AM on a Wednesday morning at a church. You're automatically gonna think he's good. - Well, at least I tried. - Always remember this, amazing grace was written by an atheist who was saved. So never stop trying. You're good man. - Thanks Boss. See you later. - Bye. - Praise be. Last time I saw an ass like that, it was carrying our lord and savior. - Are you seriously objectifying her right now? - No, I'm not objectifying her. I'm just looking at her ass. What's up with you broads making up words and shit. I'm trying to get my dick wet. Talk to you later. Anyway, I feel like you can be Columbine and I decide to shoot a bunch of kids inside of you. Hmm? You know mid 90s, you're a pog. I just start slamming that shit. Maybe you pull a Fonz and just bang against the jukebox til. Incubus plays, whatever that shit is you're into. Kati Perry? Taylor Swift? I don't know how old we are yet. Can you get a drink? Do you need a drink? - Hey Boss. - Matthew. - How's it going? - Kevin, get this bro a drink on me. So scotch? - Definitely. Definitely scotch. - I got this Highland Park viking scotch. Kevin suggested it. - Viking's honor. - Viking's honor. Good for us Norwegians. - Yeah, but you know what's not good for us. What the fuck is this AA pamphlet doing here? AA Elias in here? - Yeah, he was just in here. - I thought I saw that snail trail leading in. - Oh you heard about that weekend, huh? - Yeah. The bender to remember. - Alcoholics anonymous suits people like him. That was a hell of a weekend for him. I mean Jesus, parents got to him late Sunday night. His liver's inflamed. He's got the worst case of chlamydia or gonorrhea. That kid could not handle a weekend of liqueur. That was really, I heard it was an epic weekend. I heard it was a lot of fun. - I saw him at the beginning of that weekend. He showed up with a bottle of scotch ready to roll. - Oh yeah, he was a ball. But yeah, I think alcoholics anonymous is the correct position for him. I think that's the great place for him. - Hey, coasters? - I didn't see any. Kevin, you got coasters? - We're all out. - AA works. - AA works. - Alright. - Do you need someone to co-sign a loan for you? I don't know where you're at in your life. Would you like to see how much of my penis could fit in your mouth? I think you could almost get the whole thing. You seem like you have like a really just can do attitude, you know what I mean. You're a fighter. You're a survivor. - Are you a letter? - I've been told that I'm a D before. So. - As in a douchebag? - Like dick. I don't know if it's a big one, but it's a pretty cock. It's nice to look at. - Anyway. Since you're a letter, I'm gonna need you to C your way out. - Oh, that's funny. I'm gonna need to see you M on those tits. - I was actually one of your businesses today. - Well thank you for your patronage. - Yeah. - That's classic. Alright, which place were you at? - Mini cinema. - Did you wash your hands before you shook my hand there? - Shit. - That's okay, that's okay. - So it was weird. I went in there and I didn't see Porn peddler Pete. - Oh, he doesn't work for me anymore. - What happened? - Well he pirated pornography. I can't stand for that. I mean when you sell pornography, you have to pay the taxes, the rights, all these different fees towards it. He didn't do that. That's not right. People spend a lot of time and money making pornography. They should be paid a living wage for such things. Yeah, so he was pirating pornography all over town. And I found out about it and I had to let I'm go. Broke his heart. He loved that job. - He did love that job. Man, this whole time, everybody thought you were morally bankrupt. I guess we were just in a recession. - Irony isn't it. - Now you say it, now I do remember something about it. I heard his house got raided. Like the police came in, swat team came in and they found some stuff in the basement. - I didn't hear about this. What? - He had an archive of secret things. I mean it was almost like Donnie Darko and you realize Patrick Swayze had like the kiddie porn dungeon in there. It wasn't like that. It was a whole nother thing. Raider porn. - What's raider? I've never heard of a Raider porn. What's Raider porn? - It's when white supremacists have furry parties and they bang each other and film it. - But wait a minute. How many animals in the animal kingdom are actually white? - Like a snow leopard. - You got doves. Like an albino squirrel maybe. - God man, a polar bear. - Polar bear. - Polar bear. Yeah, polar bear. - You know when it's white supremacists is all in the missionary position. So it's gonna be boring as hell. - But wait a minute, if a brown bear comes in it just kind of throws the whole thing off. - Yeah. They ain't letting this guy in. Come on. - Imagine he walks in, do you mind if I dance with your dates? - Oh come on, they're gonna worry about it. They're gonna produce some sort of skunk baby in their minds. Come on man. That ain't gonna happen. - Imagine a neo-Nazi mid stroke in the middle of raider porn and a black bear walks in. Allah, adult shop mop and I'm soft. - I mean hand job even just, I watch you, you watch me. I would eat ass, but that would be like eating at Benny Hannas from the looks of things. - Seriously? - Yeah. For serious, oh big time. - This is the best you can do to pick up a girl? - I mean, the next one is either pull out a wallet or get you in one of my dad's Nissan's or something. I don't know what you're currently, your like current APR is or what your as far as lease goes or anything, but I can get you a car. I can get you money. Some fake titties, or something. Whatever you want, I would do it for you. - Dude, I am too good for you. - There's only one way to find out. And a lot of times, like the big trend right now I've seen online is for women to like carry men. I can be that piece of shit boyfriend that all your friends joke about. And you know, really though, when you come home, I'm... - Dude, I've been there, done that, so. - You haven't done this yet tough. - Raider porn. There's actually raider porn. That's not a joke? - No dude. I'm dead serious. - Why the hell did he have raider porn in his basement? - I don't know man. He had like some weird, sick little obsession in there. And he kept going with it. - And the cops came for it. Oh god. - They did dude. - Oh my god. I bet his nice little Methodist mother lost it when she saw the cops showing up to get his raider porn collection. - He was always in to like weird figure skating, but maybe because it's like usually white petite girls. - Well he was an interesting, he was an interesting duck. - Always kind of floating through the air, maybe like a bird. - A strange kid, a strange kid. But, I can forgive all that. But you don't pirate pornography because people are not being paid the proper taxes, fees and residuals that they are entitled to. But raider porn, that's a bridge too far. - Oh my god. Look at this sack of shit. Look at him. - Oh Christ. That is worse than having raider porn is being a stand up comedian. - I heard that porno Pete was actually saying that he was watching that stuff to build up a stand up comedy act. - So his excuse was I have a raider porn collection to... - Work on a bit. - To work on a bit. I think I'd rather be a porn hound than be a stand up comedian. That is like the lowest of the low. - God, can you imagine what it would have been like if we had to go around like the community... - You had to go door to door and tell everybody he was a standup. I'm sorry. I'm Pete, I live down at... - I live within your community. - Oh my god. What was his Methodist more upset about? The fact that he was peddling porn and pirating it all over town or that he's gonna be a stand up comedian? - Dude, I don't know. It's got. Oh my god. - Speaking, yeah, Jesus, speaking of the devil, look at that sack of shit. Oh my god. - Oh my god. How embarrassing would that be. - See, I bet his parents are so proud. Oh my god. - Oh yeah, definitely. That guys is just driving like a red mustang with a canvas top convertible. Not even a V8, a V6. Automatic. - It was a V8. I hope I'm never that low that I have to do something like that to garner attention. - Oh dude. I'd rather be sucking dick from behind in the alley making decent wage off of that than to ever have to speak any kind of words into a microphone. - Matt, please, let's make a promise that we never, ever have to do standup comedy. - Yeah. - Real quick, bathroom, three minutes. - I don't want to. - Behind this jukebox? We fucking pull this thing out. - I really don't want to. - That's okay. I'll watch you do some stuff. - Indeed rather have the Bros two times over than I'd have you. - That'd probably feel about the same. You got a little nubby nubby in each hand. A little corn holder. If that's what you want, I'll arrange it. I know them. - They don't like you though. - No one really does, but I mean. - Then why are you here? If no one likes you, then why are you here? Why don't you go fuck off? Back to Douche land? - I will do that. If you change your mind, - I'll be over here. - I won't. - That's okay. - You might. - So fuck off. - I've got that thing in the back of your mind. You'll be thinking about it. - Nope. - Think about it. - Fuck off. - God. I can't get any pussy in this place. I might as well go fucking kings and queens. - Jesus Christ dude, you're objectifying that sliz. - What does that even mean? Objectifying? You sound like one of those broads man. - You know, loose morals, a little bit of loose action. That's what I mean. - Yeah, then objectifying I was. It's my objective all night to do that. Trying to find some clam, man. A little slam clam. Clam digger. Anything I can do to muff some duff. - I didn't realize your a shoreman yourself. Nectar Wookie, a lifeless idiot whose whole existence consists of following around bands like Base Nectar. When they're not out selling bunk drugs, veggie burritos and grilled cheese, they're often swiping drinks and trying to borrow literally everything at music festivals. A Nectar Wookie is the natural enemy of a hipster, kind of like in Twilight with the vampires and werewolves. Hey, Kristen Steward is a jew. Why else would she get with a 100 year old guy with a nice german car? - I don't mean to cause alarm, but doth my nostrils deceive me, we have a nectar wookie in our midst. - Oh, I'm sorry yeah. That's me. I haven't, I haven't showered in a few weeks, so. - Also, Bonoroo has a bathroom in a few weeks. - No, that's, that's actually next week, I'm pretty sure. Yeah. - I don't have marijuana. That drink was not yours. Bonoroo is that way. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, Phish is about to take the stage man. You should go. - Guess what, guess what, Base Nectar not on the jukebox. How about you dubstep walk away from the situation you fucking wookie. - Jesus, okay. I'm sorry. - Stay the fuck out of gong fu, okay. - By the way, you guys have any mushrooms? - Get the fuck out of here. We don't have anything. - Fucking Mark Walberg in Rock Star. - That's not a bad movie, honestly. - Hey, did you see what happened to my drink? - Sorry man. The fucking woff took it. - Sorry man. - Thanks for looking out, man. Bartender, get these bros a drink on me. - So bros, it's last call. What are you thinking? - Scotch. - Scotch. - Scotch? - Scotch. - Scotch. - Better not be Doers. - Alright, bros, this is Singleton, the Glenlive 12 year, single malt. You know about that, Harold. - Hey, it's not Doers guys, we're good. - We'll pour it neat. - You know what that means? - No. - Harold. - Yes? - You're pouring it really quick. That's neat man. Neato. - What I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna put a couple drops of water in each one. It changes the molecular density. It opens it up. - Like a bouquet. - Exactly. - Like a lady's legs. - With the best water in the valley. Actually in the world. - Yep. - Best hangover cure right there. Water. - I wish we had some Roy Orbesen records. Is that how you discard your scotch? - Yeah, is there another way? - My god, you're still doing fucking Big League Chew? - Fucking A right man, cause I'm a pro. - We should have given him Doers. - What is the next plan of attack? Cause this is a lot of fun and all, but... - I have a Lyft. - Who? - Somebody named Ling. - No. No, no, no, no. Trust me. I got pepper sprayed by that broad. No. - I'm from Brooklyn, you motherfucker. - Wait, wait, there's a Brooklyn in China? - I sprayed her with my pepper. - Oh, I think I heard of that. Did she join AA Elias after that? - Oh hell yeah, she did. - Okay. - Oh yeah. - Yeah I'd sober up if I had to bang this guy. - I'm just saying, if I had my dick inside you you, your gonna make some good positive changes in life. - My god. Look, I'm gonna get on. Uber right now. I know I'm not gonna get in the fucking Uber Jew. - Oh, the Uber Jew. Yah. - Uber Jew? - Yeah. - Yeah. - It seems a little antisemitic and maybe a bit tasteless. - Oh my god. It's not like I fucking called in the sheeny shuttler. Fucking kike cart dude. Oh my god dude. - I'm on the old hieve highway. - Hey, - I wouldn't say I'm gay. But I've definitely done some gay shit, dude. - Yeah you have. - Yeah. - We're fully aware. - You haven't? No? - No. - Harold was never partook in homosexual. - You're gonna tell me with that jacket, and that beard you guys have never done anything gay? - Maybe watched the WNBA. - I would tell you, if you got more in touch with your male side, you might have, I don't know, more luck getting women. - I actually prefer the WNBA. It's more a team sport. - The only reason you like watching the WNBA is because a lot of those ladies have Adam's apples. - I really appreciate their talent. - God, would you be in to it if they did? - No, dude. I'm like a fucking ancient Roman warrior. That is the only reason why me and my other male friends have bonded in the way that we have. I wouldn't say it's anything sexual about it. It's more about becoming brothers, becoming closer than you ever could. Someone's life in your hands, you want to really trust somebody, jerk that dick off. You know what I mean. You really learn a lot about somebody. - Achilles and Hector, you are not. - No, hell no. I'm not gonna die because the back of my fucking ankle gets tweaked. You know what I mean. No, I'm like Brad Pitt, but more like Brad Pitt in Snatch. You know what the fuck I mean. - You like dikes? - Yeah. Do I like dikes? Or docks? - Guys. You like guys? - Eh, I wouldn't say I like them, but if you've never had a dude jerk you off, you haven't lived. The textile strength that a man has is so much better than a woman's. - Those calluses. - It's like getting a fucking handjob from a ranch hand, you know what I mean. Just a good firm old Midwestern hand shake. You know what I'm talking about. In fact, let me show you. From what I've learned by, I don't know, being amongst my fellow men, I'm gonna teach that lady over there a thing or two she's never seen. I'm gonna get her to suck my whole penis. - Her? - Yeah. - Her? - Yeah. Tiddle biddies over there. - Her? - Her? - Yes, let me, let me show you guys, okay. I'm, this is gonna be. Trojan warrior and that's my young squire. - This is the moment where Harold is continually baffled at how we are friends. - Let me give you a piece of advice. - I wouldn't recommend this. - I would not recommend this. - Why? She's too easy. It's too easy of a kill? It's like hunting a wounded deer? That's fine. That's all I fucking hunt, you know what I mean. - I think Tyler needs a challenge. - I'll accept roadkill. Yeah, absolutely. - Okay. - How about just enough funds to go malt scotch to appreciate this moment. - You guys keep my seat warm. I'll be getting my dick wet. When I get back, you guys can help dab it off and tell me how great we did. - He's always so rude. I'm not a prude, but I can see him appreciating the crude. - What's up girl? Get you a drink? - Yeah. Like Red Bulls over here, baby. - Sure, I love to smash Red Bull vodkas with you all night and then you can fuck me doggie style while we watch the new season of Blue Mountain State. Do you like Nickleback as much as I do? - Yes. - Yeah. - Oh my god, yeah. - I fucking love Tool. Yeah. - Pull my hair. - You're towing my toolbox baby. - Oh god. Get this little tool out right here. - Why do you call it little? - Damn, can I get a couple vodka red bulls on her please? - Wow, seriously? - Uh uh. - Who the fuck do you think you are? Do you think I'm just some little tool shed you can do whatever the fuck you want with? God, you are such a typical Cedar Falls WASP who probably only got through high school on the fact that daddy owned a car dealership. How many freshmen cheerleaders have you had your dirty little fingers in after a lacrosse game? Huh? Go home. Yeah, I can smell them from here. Go home, wash off the Axe body spray and wait for the next time that your mom signs you up for a bachelor date night at your town's failing country club. - Wow. You blew it. Guess who played piccolo their freshman year. Peace. - Whatever. Small penis. - It's bigger than yours. - I can't even see it through your jeans. Get out of here. - That's cause they're dark. - Oh, what gives Charlie Brown? - Fuck you man. I struck out. - Her? With her? - Her? - Yeah, I struck out with her. What's happened to me? - Fuck this. - Like pirates - I think it was Kirk tonight. - Guys. I'm calling in the nuclear option. - No. Not the man who's had more girls than anyone in Cedar Valley. - Yes. The sultan of sliz himself. - I do admire that man's sexual prowess. - And send. - She's doomed. - Oh boy. - Sir, you have a message. - Tyler, Matt, Harold. - Mr. Lance. Now might be a real good time for you to get horny. - It's my secret, Matt. I'm always horny. - Mr. Lance. - So cool. - He called me Harold. - Oh my god. Are you Jeff Lance? - You're goddamn right. Bros, Jeff Lance. - So what are you guys doing after this? - Going to Cornstalk at Spicoli's. - Oh really. - I heard Carolina Spine is playing. - Caroline. Spine. - Caroline. - Spine. - Get it right. - I'm sorry. - You know that song about Waterloo, right. - Yes, called Mrs. Sullivan. - Okay, so like about this Sullivan brothers and all that jazz. Okay, okay. - So oh my god, right, we gotta go. - Yep, gotta go. - Let's do this. - Carolina Spine. - Alright guys seriously, get on the fucking horns. We need a driver. We gotta get down man. Caroline's Spine. - Okay, got it. - Look at this, the initiative, I love it. Tyler the tool. Does that say fucking Grinder? - Yeah dude, trying to get my butt hole licked. - Can't meet a woman with a tongue strength that I require. - Tyler, cool it with the butt stuff, bros. I've done it. - You got a ride? - I'm a miracle worker. - It can't be Lyft. - Doth my eyes deceive me. - There's this asian lady, I climbed her great wall like I was Mongolian. Genghis Khan up in that bitch. - This, this is as poetic as Silvia Plath. It is. - Silvia Plath? - It most certainly is. - The chick that wrote Frankenstein? - Harold's eyes doth not deceive him. - Oh my god. They should have sent a poet. - They did. - Like Robert Frost? - It's gold doth stay. - The Uber Jew, the Jewish Uber driver who is very Jewish, hence he is. Uber Jew, the greatest uber driver ever. Fucking love that hebe. Hey, he who finds faithful friend finds a treasure. That's a Jewish proverb. - Hey, Bros got room for one more? - Tanner! - Hey. - Turtles Reunion tour? - You got to sit in the back. - You got to sit bitch. - Okay. - Oh my god. There hasn't been anyone as happy to see a Jew since I don't know, the disciples on first Easter. - Starting with that right away, huh. - Wait, so why are you back here again? - Well, I moved back. The cost of living in Chicago was a little too high for me. - Were you really in Chicago though? Were you in Logan Square? - I don't believe we've met. - Or more like Evanston? - Well Schaumburg actually. - I'm Harold. No, we have not had the pleasure. - Yeah, I was gonna say I would remember that beard. - Is it reminiscent of mahogany and ash? - No. - Dude, that fucking hat is sick. I gotta get me one of those with gold on it. And instead of the star, maybe use something like a knife or like a or something. - I think that would be a little much. You know I have to say, I'm a little surprised. - Oh. - To see a hipster, a tool, and bros all in the same car. I'm a little proud of you guys. I am. - Is it breaking your heart that we're ride sharing right now? - Kind of makes you wonder why Israel and Palestine can't get along. - You know, there's actually more to that. - I know. - And just like that crystal knocked the whole coverup bullshit you guys came up with. I know a fucking scam when you're trying to get that window pane insurance money. My dad sold them. I know that he... - Hey Tyler, Crystal knock knock. - Who's there? - An inside job. - And six million less Jews. - You guys have not changed one bit. - Why did you come back. You were with your bubby you said. And you were gonna work for your uncle. - Well, it ended up not working out. - Is it bubby or booby? - I'm not as good with the money as I thought I was. - That's the first you I will ever admit that joke. - So you weren't quite making six figures? - We won't talk about it. - They can't even make six inches. - What are you doing? Just rubbing nickles together to making our money or what? - Oh, I've missed you guys. I really have. - I just can't believe we found you on the app. It was a Christmas miracle. Oh sorry, a Hanukkah miracle. - Yes. - Does Hanukkah have miracles? - You can say Christmas. I'm not offended. - I don't want to offend. I just want to be historically accurate. - We're not offended that you killed Christ. - You know I really love riding with you.
