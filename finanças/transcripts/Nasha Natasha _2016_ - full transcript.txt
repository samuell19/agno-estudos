I have to run I have to run away from you I have to look For a way to escape Because your love is the target Your love is the fire That's burning me Because your love, unknowingly Spills the poison that's killing me And now I know That what could have been I don't want to see it Don't want to have it And now I decided not to lose again Alright! I'm telling you And you'll have to understand I had your poison I had your love and your fire too I had your poison I had your life And I don't want it anymore THANK YOU I thought you'd forgotten about me. It seems you didn't. Natalia, we're here!

Dreams announce a different possible reality, and delusions, a different reason. After all, we are what we do to change who we are." Passengers will board by row number. Please...

A few miles more than a trip around the world in just 30 days. 30 DAYS ROSTOV-ON-DON AIRPORT TERMINAL She has always been very determined. NOVEMBER 18TH KSK EXPRESS CONCERT HALL Since she was a child, she's been very energetic. NATALIA'S FATHER She has a magnetic personality that's drawn people to her since she was very little. We would go to my parents' house, when she was very young, the street would be empty when we arrived. But Natalia would go outside and, when we went looking for her, there would be... I don't want to exaggerate, but there were always at least ten girls surrounding her. LOVE, NATALIA OREIRO If you took your eyes off her for a minute, she would fill the house with kids. Wherever she went, there was a crowd surrounding her. It's a gift from our city. Oh, I love it! It's so beau... She was very restless since she was in my belly. She kicked a lot! I always say... Since at the time there was no way to know the gender of the baby, I said, "It's a boy, and a soccer player," because she drove me nuts with all that kicking. NATALIA'S MOTHER When she was born... to me, she was the prettiest baby in the hospital. And, yes, she was a restless kid. She would touch everything and run around all day long. Before you knew it, she was grabbing one thing, knocking another thing down, trying to put her fingers in the power sockets, pushing the TV... She was in constant movement. Because this rhythm is already... Wait. Why did I start early? You have the first part right, but then you rush. It hasn't happened to me before. We're in Rostov-on-Don. The night before the first show. We're rehearsing. MAY 19TH, 1978 I was four when Natalia was born, and I was so laid-back. And I thought that was the norm. And I noticed she was so vivacious, so mischievous. NATALIA'S SISTER Then I started to see what my sister was like. And she's exactly the same today. She still has the same personality, so nice and active. On one hand, she's very sweet and kind, but she's also so full of energy. POLAND ARRIVAL When she was little, she wanted to be an empress. An ambassador. An empress or an ambassador. She wanted to travel to every country. That's kind of what she does now, isn't it? Nati, I love you! CZECH REPUBLIC ARRIVAL Bye. ROMANIA ARRIVAL Natalia! ARRIVAL Natalia! PHILIPPINES ARRIVAL When we started to film Wild Angel, I never imagined it'd be known in the Philippines. Sunset in Israel. We move so fast. We were in our car, my husband was driving and the girls were in the back seat. And Natalia said, "Dad, I'll be someone important in life." I said, "Yeah, you'll be in the newspapers." And she replied, "Yeah, you laugh now..." We're about to start our first show. TAHITI ARRIVAL Thank you. GREECE ARRIVAL My bangs are a mess. ITALY ARRIVAL - Good morning, princess. - Good morning. In Rome, I'll be singing with Raffaella Carrà. We've rehearsed already. Zero, three, zero, three Four, five, six... I always thought she was very strong, but not specially talented. She was not better than the rest of the girls. To me, she was a girl, a teenager just like any other. I didn't fall down the stairs! I tripped a bit on my skirt, but I didn't fall. We've finished with this canzone thingy. Canzonetta? How do you say it in Italian? RUSSIA ARRIVAL SAINT PETERSBURG RUSSIA, 2001 We had been told she was very famous here. She put a wig on to be able to go sightseeing with us. NATALIA'S BACKING SINGER Wherever we went, there was a crowd yelling, "Natasha, Natasha!" It was mind-blowing, it never stopped. Natasha! It was truly astonishing, it was... different from anything else, completely unheard of. NATALIA'S GUITARIST We played in Moscow, in a beautiful, enormous skating arena. There were posters of previous concerts, because this is the place to play there. Deep Purple, Sting. And I thought, "Sting played one show, Natalia will play two. This is huge." - Are you filming me? - Yes. MOSCOW RUSSIA, 2001 NOVEMBER 28TH CIRCUS CONCERT HALL ROSTOV-ON-DON RUSSIA, 2014 Done. One, two... How are you? - How are you? I'm fine, great. - Fine, and you? Put the whole tape on it so it looks neater. Otherwise, I think this... Except in "Huracán," when the lights change. Okay, I don't have that ready. - Let's see... So, during the first song... - No, that's what I mean... - I'll tell Pablo about it. - I'll be down there. Now we will... And now I know very well Where life goes No lie can trick me I won't sell my mind for anything Say whatever you want Words... When she started working, she was very young. But she was very mature about how she handled her career. She knows how to showcase herself, how to stand on stage. She has an added charisma that not every artist has. I want a love that's flavorful and sweet That will wake up my heart at last That tells me he loves me And dies without my tenderness... She works very hard. ACTRESS, FRIEND OF NATALIA'S It's someone who... I mean, I know very few people... who work as hard as she does. TOUR PREPARATIONS Bam, bam, Ba-dam! Eight, bam! Seven, eight, bam! Better. From the top again? One, two... Do you want me to try on the doll dress and see? - Okay. - It would look straight from behind. - We could use that star you'll make here. - There, totally. One would think she has a team of image consultants, a person for this, a person for that... But she doesn't. She has total control of everything. It's just her and her mind. She obviously works with other people, but she designs everything herself, every costume change, the staging, the choreographies. She takes care of every detail. That's the love I'm waiting for A sincere love As I want and wish RUSSIA, 2003 There was this lady... There she is! She had a Natalia Oreiro card album, and she had thousands of them! She was desperate to get close to me, but security wouldn't let her. I was calling for her, but security wouldn't let her get to me. - No, let her! - No, no, no! "Please..." She kissed my hands. And I told her, "Please, stand up." - What did you tell her? - "Please, stand up." NATALIA'S SON - Why? - Because she was kneeling. - And what did you do? - I kissed her. - Why? - So she would be happy. Aren't you happy when I kiss you? Do you want a kiss? There. I know what you want. Take him. Don't you like the beige one? It's Daddy's. I forgot. - Open it. - There it is. Who's she? - Who is this? - Who? - Who is she? - Who? - Who is she? - Who? She. Who is she? Godmother Val. It was impossible for him to travel with her. It would have been very tough for him with those subzero temperatures. MUSICIAN, NATALIA'S HUSBAND It was unthinkable. He would have spent most of that time inside a hotel room. It was hard to explain to him, "Mom will come back in 20 days." To him, that was an unknown universe. He barely understands what "next day" is. One day, his mother left. Another day, she came back. The rest means nothing for him. That's why he didn't want to see her when I showed him a photo, or when she was on the phone or on Skype. He just left, he knew his mother wasn't there. He knows that's just an image, not his mother. Atita's pajamas. I miss him so much. NATALIA'S BAPTISM "Fear dries the mouth, wets the hands and mutilates us. The fear of knowing condemns us to ignorance, the fear of doing reduces us to impotence." UNITY - SOLIDARITY - FIGHT AMNESTY FOR ALL "The military dictatorship..." WORKING CLASS TO POWER TOTAL AMNESTY "the fear of listening, the fear of speaking made us deaf-mute." CIVIC STRIKE NATIONAL BUREAU OF CIVIL IDENTIFICATION ID CARD NAME - SIGNATURE The dollar pegs have fallen. What came after was an economic, financial and spiritual catastrophe for many people. Slowly, emigration became a constant. MILITARY DICTATORSHIP The queues to get passports and visas for different countries soon became part of the city landscape. Whole families left and... THE DOLLAR SOARED: BUY RATE: 30% - SELL RATE: 59% The 80's economic crisis hit us too hard. MEAT PRICE TO RISE FROM $3 TO $5 PER KILO I was young, and I had some debts. MILK PRODUCERS ASK FOR A 50% PRICE RISE So we left in search... GAS PRICE RISE BY 50% not for a better place, but we tried... to distance ourselves from the problem. SPONTANEOUS ART MY HANDPRINTS We sold everything we had here at a loss. We couldn't get more money for them anyway due to the critical economic situation. Then, between disassembling our family home and reassembling it in Spain, we spent a lot of money. Our plan was to get jobs, to work, and from then on, move forward. MÁLAGA SPAIN, 1983 We missed home, not just Mabel and I because we were older, the girls did too. At one point, we realized that home was here in Uruguay, so I told Mabel, "We have to start over." It was almost like starting over. Next day, we packed our things and flew back here. Mabel, little by little and very modestly, set up shop as a hairdresser. I got a job too, so we started over. The girls made sacrifices too. Without... They studied... spent very little... never asked for anything. So... I think I have a great family, I am... very proud of them. Transmutation: transforming an element into another by altering its structure. One Sunday noon, when Natalia was 11, I was making lunch and she came in with a newspaper and spread it on the floor. I asked her, "What are you doing?" "Looking for something," she replied. "Here: 'Models wanted, all ages, for a casting at...'" I don't know, some advertising agency. I looked at the ad and dismissed it. But her father, from the bedroom, asked, "What's up, Natalia?" She told him about it, and he said, "Okay, I'll take you there on Monday." O.B. TAMPONS COMMERCIAL In that commercial, she was shown with a very... sexy appearance. That caused that everybody started addressing her in a way she was not used to. That was obviously quite hard for her. It was an enormous change. She was pushed to transition from child to teenager very quickly. She was made fun of. Every time she passed by, everyone mocked her with the slogan: "Relax, you have a tampon on!" NATALIA'S CHILDHOOD FRIEND She couldn't even walk around, everyone looked at her and talked behind her back. She was the only girl at school who had appeared in a commercial. LIBER FALCO SECONDARY SCHOOL At that time, in Uruguay, you didn't know people who had been in commercials. And she appeared in a tampon commercial, so it was... sort of a hot topic for a teenager. There was always this ill will against us... They would push us or be rude to us, maybe even write something mean on the window panes or the blackboard. I wouldn't say they'd openly pick a fight with us, but it was close to that. QUINCEAÑERA PARTY I'm not better than you And I'm not perfect I'm still half way through I trip, but stand up again I learn from my mistakes And I think that destiny... We complemented each other, I was quite shy and quiet, and Natalia was very talkative and extroverted. Together, we were the perfect balance. And no lie can trick me And I won't sell my mind for anything Say whatever you want Words may come and go I show myself as I really am I want to live my way Say whatever you want... She started receiving many calls for auditions, and actually got selected in many of them. She was discovered quite quickly. I didn't want to audition because I didn't have faith in myself. And whether I win this contest or not, this helped me be more confident. Whatever I do in life, I know I'll give it my all, as I'm doing now. I know very well where I'm heading Say whatever you want The last memory I have of her is here, coming out of school. She was telling me that she was going to buy the tickets. She had made up her mind to leave school and start a new life in Argentina. She wanted to... Well, to seek a career there. Her destiny. WE LOVE YOU WELCOME! "Our Natasha. With love from Krasnodar." What do you think? It's such a pity to tear it. Shall I do it? Beautiful. Thank you so much. Take her stuff. We're leaving. Bye! - This is more complicated. - I'll take the pink one. - Bye. Thanks. - Bye. "Some people say that destiny rests on gods' knees. Instead, destiny is like a burning challenge that puts people's conscience to the test." We arrived in Siberia! Thirty degrees below zero. Wow! In the middle of summer... - How did it go? - Great. I have everything. - I love you. - I took a photo. Now... It looked better... I'll show you later. It's hard uphill, it's hard downhill It's hard to think there can't be change It's hard to see a pond in the sea ELEVATORS NASHA NATASHA TOUR 2014 Come in. That's it. I'm a bit emotional today. Thank you very much, Krasnoyarsk. You'll always be in my heart. We've completed one fourth of the tour. "We are made of time. We are its feet and its mouths. The feet of time walk on our feet. In the short or long term, we all know the winds of time will erase the tracks. Journey of nothingness, no one's footsteps? The mouths of time tell us of the voyage." Done. I'm so sleepy. I haven't slept a wink. - Hello! - Hi! Why is the flight delayed? - Does anyone know? - I don't want to know. Novosibirsk, Siberia. We're here for our fourth show. Be careful with the smoke. The other day, it was so dense. Was that normal? - Doesn't it burn? - It's burnt already. Natasha, Natasha! Natasha, Natasha! Natasha, Natasha! - Natasha, Natasha! - Come here. Natasha, Natasha! - Natasha, Natasha! - Come on. Give it all! TEMPERATURE: 25°C Cheers! Okay... let's sing "Me muero de amor." Do you know "Me muero de amor"? - Yes, of course! - Try it. - Does anyone have the lyrics? - I do... You left without saying goodbye Despite what I wanted Without emotion, in silence The door closed behind you "Door." You didn't want to look for answers... Soviet Union Soviet Union I had your poison I had your life And I don't want it anymore Hello, Omsk. This way. I missed her very much. She was about to turn 17 and I was 20 or 21. I remember she would come to visit us, and then she would take a bus, two blocks from home, to come here to Buenos Aires, and it was so... It was the worst part of her visit. Well, anyway... Later... Sorry. Then she went on with her career and became very successful here. I met Natalia in 1994, around the time when I used to play sax in the subway. I met her at a little karaoke bar in Buenos Aires... ACTOR, FRIEND OF NATALIA'S that was away from the places everyone frequented. One day, when I was playing at that bar, I saw her and asked where she was from, and she said, "I'm from Uruguay." She told me she lived alone in a rooming house. She said she wanted to be an actress, and that she had come from Uruguay chasing that dream. She was a diamond in the rough waiting to be discovered. And it was great to witness her discovery and everything that came after. Chase new dreams... It was something... Everything happened so quickly. Every time she came back to Uruguay, you couldn't walk around our block because of the crowd that came to see her. From walking with her to the bus stop to say goodbye, just us, in a year and a half, two years tops, we were surrounded by people. This way? - This way. - Yes. Oh! I'm going to miss the train to Yekaterinburg! Shooting stars usually pass us by, never to be seen again. But she is like a shooting star that came here to stay, changing her colors, looking for something new, always reinventing herself. That's what she is. Sometimes being an artist is not enough, you have to be more than that. And when there's more, you get someone like Natalia. Phenomenon: an extraordinary event that is hard to explain for those who see it. Historically, Russian people have always been interested in the matters of the heart. RUSSIAN JOURNALIST RESIDING IN BUENOS AIRES Very romantic, even sentimental. But that's very hard to admit, right? It's hard to say, "Okay, yeah, I'm a sentimental person. I have feelings. I suffer too." And besides, we were told for many years, "No, we're strong, strong like the Soviet Union." Attention! Right flank! Ready for the ceremonial parade. We had never had movies or series about women, or about those kinds of feelings. We had stories about how we had to work for the sake of our country, to build Socialism. So, we lacked that side of things. Where was that feminine side? Right? It didn't exist. Starring Natalia Oreiro... and Facundo Arana. - I'll take pain... - Wild Angel. WILD ANGEL I was 12 when Wild Angel premiered. We thought, "Look, she seems to be a girl like us, right?" She was like any girl in our neighborhood. She could even be my friend. Of course, on one hand, she was very pretty, nice, funny, but on the other hand, she also had a strong character. I knew you couldn't be trusted, Carlitos. Can't you see I'm a girl, man? I wanted to confirm you're a woman. And I wanted to confirm you're a man. At that time, in Russia, we were more closed-minded. Every female character in soap operas were girls who were always crying. But this series was different. Don't touch me or I'll bite you! Okay, I won't. I'll just do it. Just do what? She talked back. She was very self-assured. We wanted to be like her. - Get out of my room now! - I haven't finished with you! You didn't? You're so finished! Get out or I'll kick the macho out of you! - Why are you so mad? - Why? "Why?" I said I wouldn't touch you, and I didn't. - But you kissed me. - And you liked it. - I didn't love it! - You did! - I didn't like it! - Admit it. You liked it. - Say whatever you want, you liked it. - I didn't! - You did! - Out! I loved it. NATALIA OREIRO IS BACK - IS SHE SINGLE? EVERYTHING ABOUT NATALIA OREIRO I have to run... Almost every girl had pictures of Natalia Oreiro on their bedroom walls. We had markers, notebooks, stickers that were sold everywhere. There were Natalia Oreiro pendants. Because your love, unknowingly Spills the poison that's killing me... She represented what a woman is for us. SPANISH CLUB IN KRASNODAR We did our hair as hers. - We even copied her bangs. - Yes, the bangs! I'm telling you And you'll have to understand I had your poison I had your love and your fire too... I waxed half of my eyebrow and redraw it in an angle to look like her. I like to style my eyebrows since then. Exactly. She expressed femininity. We wanted to be like her. And to talk like her, that's why we were learning Spanish. Obviously, in Moscow, most classes teach Castilian Spanish. And I got lower grades for speaking with an Argentinian accent. To me and many others, Argentina and Buenos Aires weren't the land of Maradona, Evita, or Perón. That city was the land of Natalia Oreiro and Wild Angel. This is beautiful! For many Russians, Natalia is as Russian as them. It may be in part because of her name. Natalia, Natasha, is a very common name in Russia. I'm a Siberian woman. For many Russians, traveling, even within the country, like visiting Moscow, is a dream very hard to achieve. Because Russia is a huge country. HI! So when they see that someone comes to their city, their town, obviously, they feel a connection much closer than... Than between a celebrity and their fan. Thank you so much! Her fans are different. They truly admire her, they're not as crazy as other fandoms. They also take good care of her. And that speaks volumes about her too. Hi! Yeah, generally, in Russia, presents are something quite meaningful. A gift is a way to say, "Now we are connected, now you have something from me." Yes! - Thank you. - Thank you. It's even a way to express your emotions. Because maybe we're not as good at expressing them in words. Yes! - Cholito. - Cholito! We were in Argentina, and she bought these flowers in Buenos Aires to bring them for Natalia. There are no jasmines in Siberia. Oh, yes, say yes Oh, yes, say yes Oh, yes, please say yes Russians very often have meetings, or go to Latin parties, mostly Argentinian parties. They bring hearts with her name on them and film videos. Natalia had her own style. In the series, her favorite singer was Gilda. Only through Natalia Oreiro and her series could we know about that culture. Who knows the steps? Who wants to dance? Let's dance! Alright? Let's do it! That girl. Those two. That girl, that one, yes, you. Natasha! Hi, how are you? - What's your name? - Vera. - Nice to meet you, Vera. Hi, how are you? - Hi. Nastia. "How are you?" "Nastia"? "What's your name?" Is it okay? - What's your name? Nastia? - Nastia. - How are you? - Great. Great! Hi, how are you? So many kisses. Okay, a little... A little... Alright. Everybody! One, two, three! MOSCOW YEKATERINBURG I don't regret this love UFA Even if I lose my heart to it SAINT PETERSBURG OMSK Love is a miracle and I loved you As I never imagined I could Who will rip me from your skin? NIZHNY NOVGOROD From your memory, your past I feel life passes us by And today will never come back KAZAN MINSK Russians are said to be cold and distant, but in fact we're really warm, and when we open our doors to someone and welcome them, that's it, you're part of us now, there's no turning back. You'll be an honorary Russian forever. It looks good on you. Alright! Many of us still think she's from Argentina. Then we were corrected, "No, she's Uruguayan." Oh, well, who cares, she's our Natasha, that's it. It's so cold. It's so cold. - Please, don't get in! - It's so cold! It has to do with her charisma and her way to relate to people. And the wind breaks you... She talked to us as if she were one of us girls. That was it. That was very important, she didn't put herself on a pedestal, like a goddess... unreachable. She treated us like peers, as if she could sit with us and chat about anything. They see Natalia as their... Their sister, their friend. I will cry today. She takes some time off in every city, at least 15 minutes, leaves her family, everything aside, and goes see her fans. And she cares a lot about them. SAMARA, RUSSIA It's hard to explain, but I feel... as if a piece of my body was always... with my son. I... enjoy myself a lot every time I go on stage, and when I smile... That smile reflects what the audience gives me. So much love... so much affection and joy, such a long wait. I usually watch videos from fans... who tell me they've been following me for 15 years. And I see they were little then. That gives me so much energy. But when the show ends... it's quite hard. Lucid dream: the altered state of consciousness where the person has a dream and gains control over it. It's hard to walk along the street Urban painting Disappointment is hard PLEASE SPEND SOME TIME WITH US Diving head first all the time From every springboard But sadness remains The river used to be silver There are so many needs Despair is hard It's hard uphill Snow! - It's hard downhill - But why? It's hard to think there can't be change It's hard to see a pond in the sea The river is swelling We'll see what happens Oh, the river is swelling Six o'clock in the morning. We're playing today. Well, we'll try. The river is swelling Oh, it's so hard uphill Walking on the avenue It takes an endless will To make the moon come out again Among so many rewards Among so many high winds It's hard uphill It's hard downhill It's hard to think there can't be change It's hard to see a pond in the sea Your attention, please... It's simple: if I don't sleep, I can't sing. My voice is gone. It's a basic thing. I can't perform three nights in a row without sleeping! It's impossible. What time is it? It's 7:22. So... Okay, there are eight minutes left for 7:30. Excuse me, sir, what seems to be the problem? The newspapers will say I canceled the show. It's a problem between him and the manager. He never paid me either, and I performed every night anyway. Well, we have a problem, the tour manager that brought us here doesn't want us to play our last show, after opening the doors, with the audience, who don't know a thing, already here, because the local manager didn't pay him. Well, that manager who brought us haven't paid us for any show either, but we played anyway. What would you do? - The river is swelling - We'll see what happens We'll see what happens Oh, the river is swelling - We'll see what happens - The river is swelling We'll see what happens Oh, the river is swelling WITH LOVE FROM A FRIEND The river is swelling We'll see what happens Oh, the river is swelling MOSCOW MOSCOW THE NIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW, 3:00 A.M. I believe in dreams. And in luck too. And in destiny too. But most of all, I believe in opportunities. And when an opportunity comes, if you think it has... a place... as a part of your dream, you have to grab it. But there is... no success without hard work. I think your truest reality lies more in your dreams than in life itself. You put color to your life to make it more bearable. It's where everything is possible, where you direct your own movie. So, the design of that dream is part... DECEMBER 31ST, 2001 BRAZIL of what you'd like... to happen to you. R AND N After so much dreaming After so much waiting... The first time I met him, he was coming down the stairs. He was with someone who introduced him: "This is my friend Ricardo." When he finally appeared, I could only see his smile. Actress and singer Natalia Oreiro got married in secret with Argentinian rock musician Ricardo Mollo. She gave me the chance to feel that I could fall in love. I've only experienced that with her. That's something big. You're so full of light Your eyes are the river I sail up to your heart... By the power vested in me as the captain of this ship, I now pronounce Natalia Oreiro and Ricardo Mollo husband and wife. The storms of love That your body brings me Your smile brought me the sun... Respect for each other, support, care. That... is love. Your eyes are the river I sail up to your heart MOSCOW AIRPORT, 2014 Happy birthday to you Again! Happy birthday to you - What are you doing? - Playing the wah-wah on the guitar. Your attention, please... Hi! Hi, little piggy. Hi! I missed you so much! I love you. I love you very much. Shall we go to the hotel? Up you go! Yay, let's go! Hi, Russia! - Bye, thank you! - Thank you. Bye, thank you so much! Thanks. You left without saying a word Closing the door Just when I was asking you a little more Fear pushed you away from the nest Without an answer Leaving a hurt heart Leaving me behind And now I die of love if you're not here I die and I can't wait For you to come back here again Next to me, with your kisses I die of love if you're not here I die and I can't wait I need you to be here, next to me Without your love, I can't go on Hi, how are you? Okay? SAINT PETERSBURG Natalia is a smile. Natalia is courage. Natalia is pure heart. Natalia is a feeling. - She's our Natasha. - She's our idol. - She's our childhood. - She has a Russian soul. Natalia is a bridge between Russia and Latin America. I'll change pain for freedom I'll change wounds for a dream... We were visiting the Hermitage Museum and Natalia came in, I was behind her. And one of the museum guards, she saw Natalia pass by and said in Russian, "Anastasia has returned." It was really funny, she stared at Natalia, followed her with her eyes and then said, "Anastasia has returned." It is truly amazing how well prepared she is. Music, cinema, photography... painting. These look like leaves. These are leaves. They're carved. Her audience can see beyond the photos, the songs, the soap operas. They have the chance to see a person, a person who is so transparent that makes them feel moved. I traveled to Argentina, to Montevideo. It's something I cannot explain, it's... It's a very strong feeling. If Milagros could find her father, I can find mine too. That was my main incentive to look for him. Eventually, I found him. BOLSHOI BALLET MOSCOW, 2014 RETURN TO THE ORIGIN: CYCLICAL CONCEPTION OF TIME IN WHICH THE END IS AN ETERNAL RETURN TO THE BEGINNING. Many times I wondered why this has happened... this thing with me and Russia. Or other countries that are so far away from Uruguay. And I... couldn't understand it. It was such a different culture, with such a different language, because, although my movies and series were often dubbed, sometimes they were only subtitled. And my songs are in Spanish, and people in my concerts listens to them and sings them in Spanish. And every time I went there, it surprised me and filled me with love. It was incredibly moving, but I couldn't understand why that was happening to me. I thought it'd be fleeting, that it wouldn't happen the following year. But every time I went there... more people loved me. And I thought again, "They won't remember me next year," as if I was a fad. But they never forgot me. And during this last tour, I finally got it. And I think it happens... because... what you love in your childhood stays forever in your heart. Most people who come to my shows grew up with me. There was a bar here. When I came back from school, my grandpa was sitting here. There used to be... See? There are rocks underneath. They're covered with grass now. My grandma lived across the street. I used to play with some girls from there. This was my grandma's house. She had a rose bush here. This is the shed where I used to dress up. - What games did you play here, Natalia? - Anything, I dressed up... role-played, played school, cooked. I spent whole days in here. And here... And here... my grandma had many plants. I remember I made little bird houses and put food for them. I have a photo of me here with a chick. I held it like this. "Each person shines with his or her own light among all others. No two fires are alike. There are big fires and small fires, and fires of every color. There are people with serene fire, who don't even notice the wind, and people with crazy fire, who fill the air with sparks. Some fires, foolish fires, do not light or burn, but others burn life with such desire that you cannot look at them without blinking, and whoever comes close to them... lights up." With tears in my eyes I drifted away I experienced how hard it is To leave it all behind My people, my neighborhood Having to leave my land Alone when I was still a child Leaving it all behind chasing my fantasies I'm from the Río de la Plata, I have a Latin heart and a candombe soul I always wear a smile And carry my dreams on my back I have no borders I'm from the Río de la Plata Long live candombe and its hot blood That rhythm that lights up my soul And makes my people's eyes shine I'm from the Río de la Plata, I have a Latin heart and a candombe soul I always wear a smile And carry my dreams on my back I have no borders I'm from the Río de la Plata Long live candombe and its hot blood That rhythm that lights up my soul And makes my people's eyes shine YOU'RE THE SAME AS ALWAYS Thank you!
