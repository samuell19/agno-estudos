Sorry. Right son, you're nicked. What, what is that voice? Well, it's just a policeman's voice, why, do you not like it? It's just a bit, get out of my pub. Shut it, you slag. Shh! Don't shush me, lad, I'm a police officer, in fact you're the one that has the right to remain... Shh, no, seriously. What's up? I thought I heard something downstairs. And I think I can see something downstairs. No, I thought Pete had come back, but his car's not there. Just relax, it's probably just the cat or something, yeah. I haven't got a cat. - Well, a dog then. - I haven't got a dog. - A rabbit? - No, look, I haven't got any animals. Shit, there it was again! Go and see then. I'm scared, you go. I don't know where the kitchen is. It's not upstairs in the attic, is it? Um, look, it's your kitchen, you go and look. Okay, we'll go together, but be quiet. Hey, who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are we? We're the fucking people who live here! - Yeah. - Well, he doesn't, but. You're a copper? No, I'm not a real policeman. Then why the fuck are you dressed like one? We were. Hold on, are you a copper as well? I said I wasn't a real policeman. Hey, shut up, man! Shut up! Hey, that's one of my knives. Shut the fuck up or I'll carve the pair of yous. Now move over here, come on. Hey, come on! Why have you moved us over here? I don't know, I've seen it in a film. Listen, police officer! You tell me what's going on. - I'm not a real policeman. - Then why the fuck are you dressed like one? You're one of them, aren't you? No. Well, we're two of them. Well, seeing as you like things up your arse so much, I think you're gonna enjoy what I'm gonna do with this. - No, see I'm the top. - Shut the fuck up! My God, look over there, it's Meghan Markle! What? That worked quite well. Very well. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! I thought you were meant to be straight acting you. Shut up, what are we meant to do now? What do you mean? What do you mean what do I mean? There's a burglar just been knocked unconscious by a rent boy dressed as a policeman in my kitchen! Hey, I am a high class escort, technically he's not a burglar. Shut up, I am calling the police. No, no, no, wait, no, you can't call the police. If you do, they're gonna wanna come here and they're gonna wanna take statements and there might be a court case and I can't afford for anybody to know that I've been here with you, Kieran would murder me, if he knew that I'd been shagging about behind his back and then there definitely would be a court case. Fuck! And forgive me, because I don't know Peter, but I'm guessing that he's not gonna be that thrilled about all this either, is he? No, you're right, so what are we meant to do, just sit here and play Buckaroo, until he wakes up and starts dicing us like roasted pheasant? Pheasant? Chicken then, whatever, what are we gonna do with him? Look, he's outside the law, isn't he? We've no connection to him, no responsibility towards him, nobody except the two of us even know that he's here. I say that we just dump him and let him figure it out himself. He'll come back. What for, the sparkling conversation? I don't think so, mate. Look, he's made a botched burglary attempt, he's had a nasty knock to the head from a copper. You're not a copper. And he's gotten away with it without being handed over to the police, I'd just think myself lucky and drag myself back to my cave. - Okay. - Here, pass us that chain. Just in case. Of what? Pheasant. You should change. I wish I could, mate, but it's just part of my nature. Wait, you mean my clothes? Right then. You know, I was just thinking, it's funny really, 'cause now we're not calling the police, I won't be the only copper, who's not coming tonight. What are you doing? I'm making a drink, do you want one? No, thanks, I'm driving, even off duty, I'm a good lad. How are you so relaxed? We need to think of what we're gonna do with him. He's hardly any threat to us now, is he? I mean, if you think about it, we could do anything we wanted to him really, couldn't we? I'm not including him in one of your sordid sex games. Sordid sex, thank you very much, you weren't saying that 10 minutes ago, were you? Quite a lot has happened in the last 10 minutes, hasn't it? I didn't mean sex games anyway, I was just thinking that we could give him a bit of a slap about a bit. He is quite cute though, in't he? - Fuck! - What? You know that you were concerned about him like waking up and slashing us and that? Yep. Well, I've got some good news on that score. What? He's dead. I beg your pardon? - He's dead. - Well, are you sure? Well, if he's not, he's very good at holding his breath and heartbeat. Christ! No, no, no, don't touch him! - Why not? - Because you haven't yet and if this becomes a murder case. Fuck! If this becomes a murder case, you want the less evidence the better, you don't want your fingerprints or DNA anywhere near him. - But you touched him! - I know that! Fuck! Stop saying that! But I can't go to prison! I'm a vegetarian and everything, I can't even watch "Lion King" without getting upset when Mufasa dies, I can't go to prison! You're not gonna go to prison though, are you, 'cause you've not done anything wrong! I have, I'm a murderer. Hey, hey, - you're not a murderer. - I am. You're a manslaughterer. Well, thank you very much indeed, that's a whole lot better. No, what I mean is it was a self defense thing, he came at you with a knife and you defended yourself. Yeah, you think that'll go down in court, do you? When they say, so tell us what happened on the day in question, I'll say well, he came after me with a carving knife and I managed to distract him by telling him that Meghan Markle was behind him, then I hit him over the head with a policeman's truncheon. Don't think so, mate, this isn't Carry On Cosplay. What are we meant to do then? What other options have we got? When you think about it, nothing's really changed. What do you mean? Well, when we made the plan to dump him, he was still alive, the fact that he's dead now doesn't really matter. I think it matters quite a lot to him. No, I mean, he could've died after we dumped him. So you wanna just throw him out? Well, look, we were going to anyway, there's still no connection to us, nobody knows that he's here, nobody knows that we know each other, there's no motive. But there'll be DNA on him. Well yeah, mine maybe, but not yours, all you need to do is wipe that chair down and mop that floor and look at the bright side, you get your knife back. No, there'll be fluff and dust on him from me and Peter and... Maybe, yeah, but the fluff and dust department of the police station won't know the difference between your fluff and dust and the fluff and dust of everyone whose ever traveled on the 219 to Warrington. Look, what I mean is those tiny little particles could've got on him anywhere during the day, I'm telling you, there's no trail, there's no proof, it can't come back to us. I don't know, what if someone sees us? Well, obviously we'll have to drive out of town, won't we? I can't drive. But I can, you'll have to come with me though. What, no, I don't want to, you do it. Fuck that! What if I get caught? I take all the rap and you get away with it Scott free, I don't think so, pal. Well, what if Peter comes back? Yeah, because nipping out for a bit is far worse than getting buggered by a policeman on his bed, come on, man! You did this, if we both get pulled on it, it's you in the wrong, not me. Says who? - Me. - Your word against mine. And the CCTV. What, where? There and there. Fucking hell! Who has CCTV in their house? Rich people. - Why? - Because of this. So I'm not coming, so you're gonna have to sort it out yourself. Alright, alright, fine, I'll do it on my own, but I'm gonna tell everyone that I was here when it happened and that you put me up to it, you encouraged me and you and I have been having this really weird, sick, sordid affair behind your husband's back, really sick shit as well, I'm gonna tell them that you like being called Nipper and that you crawl around on your hands and knees and that you ate dog food and you'll lose him and you'll lose the money and you'll lose the house and you'll be on trial for murder, ha! You wouldn't. Yes, I fucking would, Nipper, unless. Unless what? Unless there was more in it for me. - Like what? - Like an incentive. What do you mean? Well, look at this place, you're hardly shy of a few quid, are you? Big house, nice cars, cordless Dyson. What is your point, Lloyd Grossman? Hush money, a one-off payment, I get rid of the body, we never see each other again. What? You can afford it living here, you've probably gone through more cards than Dynamo. - Who? - And Daddy, sorry, hubby will pay it off, no questions asked, probably won't even notice, I'm assuming he's a little bit older than you are. I'm not paying you. You'd better start looking for somewhere else to live then, hadn't you, murderer? How much? Where's your last credit card statement? Just so I know how much I've got to play with. You've got balls. You should know, sent you enough pictures. Your middle name's Julian. Hurry up, I want you out. Five grand. - Fuck that! - Come on, it's not enough that he'd notice it missing and it's enough to keep me quiet. And I'll never see you again? Never. And you'll delete our conversation history? Here and now and you delete all the CCTV footage as well. Don't worry, I'll get rid of that. No, do it now, so I know it's done. Fine, come on. Deleted, done. And the bank transfer? What's your sort code? Pheasant. What a twat. Yeah, it was kind of him to leave the door open. Well, made it easier for us. Hey, it's me, did you get the footage? Yeah, we've got it. Good work, officer. Thanks, sarge.
