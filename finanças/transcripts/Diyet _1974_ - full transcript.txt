Blood Money Alright! Everyone back to work! -Master Bilal? -The machine, sir, it snatched him. -Whom? -Mustafa, the new guy. The machine got someone, we don't know if he's alive! I hope he's not dead! Let's go! -It's Mustafa, Aliye's betrothed. -Mustafa! What happened to him? Tell me! -Wait, Aliye! -Let me go! It's him! It's my Mustafa! What happened, tell me, Master Bilal! Will he live? It was misfortune. What else could it be. Alright, stop crying. Emine, you take care of Aliye. Hacer, you let Mustafa's mother know. Everyone back to work! Why are you standing there like that? Go on! A man has died! It was an accident. No need to make a big deal out of it! That "deal" is about a young man's life! So what, you'll just stand there? It was an accident! Happens every day, by the hundreds! An "accident"! That thing is not a machine, it's a butcher! You have that machine to thank for the bread you eat. We earn our bread with the sweat of our brow! What can the machine do without us? Who is this machine you speak of? Salim Bey better not hear this nonsense. He will! We will tell him the very same things! You will not snitch on us. You mean now, with all that just happened? Yes, now. Don't get in our way! Let's go. Yes. It was an accident, sir. No. It was carelessness, you see... He's in the hospital now. As you wish. Goodbye. We're looking forward to your visit. Of course. We'll go to Yeniköy, by the sea. Good day, sir. Goodbye, sir. Farewell. So, you thought you'd seize this opportunity to cause trouble. -Am I right? -Not at all. -But this machine... -What about it? It's not a machine, sir, it's a murderer. Look, Master Muhsin. You're an educated man. Be reasonable. Think about it. How can you know better than the German engineers who designed that machine? Those great Germans have designed newer machines. That's all we ask for. If we don't replace this machine, it will be the end of many more. What can I do? Of course, I don't want to see anyone get hurt. I have kids of my own. Listen, guys... Don't try to cause trouble. So, you're unionized. Fine. 58 people work here. You're not even 10 people. Don't come to argue with me at every opportunity. It was an accident. He will be compensated. That's the end of it. -But, the machine! -Do you hear what you're saying! The new machine costs 450,000 lira. Without the customs tax. This is a small business. If we go for such ventures, we'll go under. And you, will be without jobs. 450,000 lira! You couldn't even count all of it. How many machines is a man worth? Alright, enough of this. Back to work. -As you wish, Salim Bey. -Go on. How's it looking? They're working, but they're testy. Some are undecided. Lots of growling. Get me their names. We'll give them a little raise. -Who's on the machine now? -No one at the moment. You operate it for now. It'll help us during the inquiry. As you wish. Have a seat. Why are you standing like that? I'm not hungry, daughter. Have a seat. You can't go on without food. None of that union nonsense. You mind your own business. Got it? Good. Your weekly pay is 200 lira, for now. If you work hard and do as you're told, we'll see... Of course, sir. -Whatever you say. -Off you go, then. You made a fool out of me! If you weren't from my hometown, I'd show you! But, what did I do? You ingrate, the man is giving you a job, providing for you, and you don't even think to kiss his hand? Forgive me, aga! Not mine, you were supposed to kiss Salim Bey's hand! Let go! This is your workplace. It's easy. Yet, keep your eyes open. If you start slacking, the machine might get you! -Aliye hasn't come today. -She is helping Mustafa's mother. She has to prepare food, do the laundry. She took the day off. They hired someone from outside for Mustafa's place, no one here would be dumb enough to man that machine! Have you heard? Salim Bey is all worked up. They say if Mustafa had joined the union, he could've gotten a hefty compensation. -And won't he, now? -No way, he wasn't even registered. I'm telling you, you should get yourself registered. Why don't you listen to me? It could happen to any one of us. You keep silent like a swine. Have it your way, then! Don't say I didn't warn you. Mevlüt, any news from Mustafa? No, only that he was better off dead... What do you mean? He is crippled from the waist down. -Where's Aliye? -She's on leave. What happened? I didn't want to bring this up so soon, but... If Mustafa was unionized, they couldn't have gotten away with this so easily. He should have gotten 100,000 lira worth of compensation for this! How long have you been working here? Two years? That's right. Why do you ask? Why haven't registered with the union? We're like foreigners here. We know nothing about any of that. So what? Where we come from they say, "don't back a horse you know nothing about". -Where are you from? -We're from Afyon. I'm from Nigde. We have a saying too, "don't feed your horse to the hounds". So, by your measure, we're horses here? Don't know, she's got it all mixed up. Look here, Serife, watch out for this Hacer. Not even a hello to us again, Hacer? As you wish. Here, wear these overalls. Don't get dirt on your clothes. Were you planning to wear them on holiday? Sergeant! Where can I change my clothes? This is a factory, not the military! My title is "foreman"! The cabinets are over there. Look for the fifth one from the right. Let me give you a ride home. Have pity on your own feet. Forgive me, miss. You forgot these in the cabinet. I told her I'd carry her on my back and she wouldn't let me. You think you can get her with a pair of shoes? Mother! How is Mustafa? -We heard... -It is as you have heard, my girl. My son, strong as a lion, will be no different than a blade of grass. What kind of fate is this? Grandpa. Grandpa! Mom, grandpa is crying! WARNING! NO VAGRANCY Hang them all over, inside the lunchroom as well. IF YOU ARE CARELESS... They think they'll get away with it by hanging those posters. They are all over. They'll say "we took all the necessary precautions" during the investigation. Nothing will come of this. You have to grow in numbers. We need at least 30 members. That will be difficult. Most workers here come from the countryside. Just the mention of a "labour union" frightens them. They get so stubborn, we can't convince them in any way. They get hired on the ground that they won't join the union, there's that too. I know... But if we could convince them, they'd do this better than any of us. We have to convince them. Let's hand these out and see what happens. -Patience turns dough into bread... -And berry leaves, into silk. We should drop these from the sky with a plane, they'll think it's God's will! STRENGTH THROUGH UNITY What the hell is this! I don't know, aga. I found it on the machine this morning. Who handed these out! I don't know, sergeant! I mean, Master Bilal. -Keep your eyes open, if you see them, come tell me. -I will. Have you gotten used to the job? Yes. It's so easy. It's forbidden to read or distribute these during work hours. -Stop trying to muddy the waters! -Don't worry, Master Bilal. It's a piece of paper, after all. "Worker brothers". So you all come from the same father, or what? "Join the union... No more pay cuts... No more accidents... No more foul food." "The labour union fights for your rights. You can't do it alone." What is all this slander! If that's what it is, don't worry, no one will believe it anyway. These must have been destined for you. Mustafa will no longer walk. You started work just the other day. How did you get those shoes? They don't fit? If they don't fit, they're mine. Where there's a will, there's a way... Come and do your laundry, while we still have water. I have a job, now. Don't mind me, Zehra Ana. I hope we're not a burden for you. Not at all! -I haven't seen my father today. -He left in the morning. I took care of the kids. He must be looking for work. He's looking, but is there any work to be found? -I'm leaving, Zehra Ana. -Alright my girl, thanks for everything. Come tomorrow and we'll visit Mustafa. We will. They said life in foreign lands was like death itself. -So it was true... -Stop talking like that, father! Being jobless, useless, depending on your daughter. It is like death. Why don't you sell something? I've never done that job, my daughter. I can't get used to it. You'll get used to it, Yunus Aga. Here I am, washing laundries for bachelors, after everything. We had better days, too. But no point dwelling on that now. And with what happened to my Mustafa... What will we do now? Have Hacer cook some börek... You can sell them from a food stall. Instead of just sitting there. But, how can I handle all that. Wake up before dawn. Cook börek. Go to factory. Take care of kids. He can sell hair combs, socks, vegetables. I don't know! Everyone finds a way to get by. No one starves to death. What is it? Have you brought laundries? -Greetings. -To you, too. I couldn't recognize you? It's my first time. I have a job, now. Alright, leave them there. When will they be ready? I can't say. Come tomorrow. Forgive me, I overheard you talking... I have neighbour, he sells balloons. If it's of any use... Of course it would be of use. We were talking about Yunus Aga. Hacer's father. It would not be proper for me to say... Where do we find them, how do we buy them. We know nothing about it. I'll take care of it, if you say yes. I can hardly hear my own voice. How can I wander the streets, shouting? There's no other way, Yunus Aga. You'll get used to it. Once you start earning 20 or 30 lira a day, you'll get your voice! It's money. It makes men scream! Are you barely making a living? Don't blame anyone else, the fault is yours! And yours alone! Listen to what I'm saying! If you join the union, they will have no choice but to increase your wages! That man of yours, no one can stop him, now that he's started talking. He's like this when we're alone as well. Once he starts talking about the union, I can't shut him up. When are you getting married? Whenever they increase our wages. He'll be lucky to not get fired, if he keeps talking like that. ...To prevent workplace accidents, no more spoiled food served to us... An increase in your wages. These are all in your hands! I see you've started running your mouth again. Are you afraid of what's coming out of my mouth, Master Bilal? Nothing I say here is illegal. It's all written down in the law. Sergeant! I'm sorry. Master Bilal. -There must be a mistake here. -What is it? -My pay was 200 lira. -So? -There's only 166 lira here? -It's fine! They must have deducted the tax! Move along! -He promised me 200. -Yes. I can guess. But, who else will pay taxes, if not us? 1 lira each for the balloons, and 15 for the gas. This is what's left over. And if he sells all of them? He'll make a profit of, say, 30 or 40 lira. I'll take my leave. Why don't you stay? I made some börek. Thank you. I don't want to be a burden. Thank you as well. Will he be able to sell them? Whatever is written... Greetings. -Welcome. -Hello. -All is well? -I hope so... But, not really. I have bad news. You will have to vacate the house. We gave it to a contractor. They'll build an apartment here. Please let Ms. Zehra know as well. Yunus... Stop being so gloomy. You can't get anywhere like that. -This harlot they call Istanbul. -A harlot it is indeed. If someone from my hometown saw me like this, and said "I saw Yunus on the street selling balloons"... I'd rather be dead. Look at this disgrace. It was hard for me too, until I got used to it. My son in law forced me into this mess. That's how it is around here. Even in your family home, you have to work to make ends meet. -Any news from that groom of yours? -No. That bastard abandoned Hacer and the two kids, he's gone. How far we've fallen... It's been five years since we left our hometown. This kid had just been born. Misery is all we've known. No jobs, no hope. Ibrahim was supposed to be my husband. He gambled, he drank, he beat me. He turned out to be no good. I didn't mind, since he was my husband, and only he could protect us. Then he left one day, without a word. Turns out, he signed up for a construction job in Iskenderun. We sent word, but he didn't even bother writing us back. Then we heard he signed up for work abroad. Left me with these children. As I told you before, aga, this is how people survive here. Dealing with the city folk... is nothing like working the earth. You make your way among this crowd by kicking, if necessary. If you can't do that, you're done for. Consider yourself dead. I was thinking to myself... No matter if you are out in the country, or in this sea of people, in the city... Loneliness belongs only to God. Among this endless crowd, you and I should watch out for each other. That's what I thought. Come here! -Yes, aga, what can I do? -Have a seat. These unionists, did they come your way? Of course not, they wouldn't dare. Why not? They've been going all around. I wouldn't let them near me, sergeant. -Foreman! -Yes, foreman. -We need to find out the ones they tricked. -We will! And after I find them, I'll give them a good... Hey, none of that. But, Master Bilal, they bite the hand that feeds them! You leave the rest to me. What are those? These? Nothing. Some food for the kids. Did you settle down with someone, without us knowing? Is it Hacer? Why are you silent? Hacer is a good one, doesn't get involved in that union business. But, she's not like those girls, you know. No, aga, it's not like that. In this foreign land, it's hard to be alone. Well then, Hasan, if you work hard I'll take care of your arrangements. -It'll be my favor to you. -Whatever you say, aga. Ms. Zehra, here... Thank you. You've helped us so much. -I hope you're doing better. -Thank you. Please, sit down. Don't act like strangers. -It was good of you to come. -Here, we brought these for you. -You got out of the hospital quickly. -Yes, but for what? It was fate. What can we do. Sure enough. Everything happens according to God's plan. But, there's more. This accident could have been prevented. You know, if only that machine... Listen. If only you had stopped being stubborn, and we stuck together, and said: "If you don't replace that machine, we won't work here!" They call that a "strike", according to the law. -Welcome, all. -Hello. Hacer, we would like to change your mind as well. To do what, seize another man's property? Not by force. By coming to an agreement, together. The women respect you. If you join us, it would be of great help. I'm sorry. What we know is this: “You don't bite the hand that feeds you.” -That's how we were brought up. -Those are old manners. They belong out there in the country, but this is the city! This is the factory. This is Istanbul! There's a different order here! Alright, calm down. Mustafa, we spoke with the management, the union lawyer will defend your rights even though you are not a member. You will get the biggest compensation. You could even set up your own shop! I hope so. Thank you all so much. We'll take our leave. Farewell. Please, come again. Don't forget us. -Take care. -Farewell. -Hello. -Hello. -Why were they here? -To visit Mustafa. Come in. -I got these for the kids. -Thank you. Please, come in. -Hello. -Hello. What did they want? I don't know. Union this, union that... "Let's come together", "increase wages", "better food", "replace the machine"... Whatever you can think of. We can only do these together, they say. There's a line in the holy book. Our prophet commands: "2 is better than 1, just as 3 is better than 2, and 4 is better than 3, therefore, come together." -A gift from Salim Bey. -Give him our thanks. He is a generous man, but only to those who are loyal to him. So, show him where you stand. -How's that thing going? -It's done, Master Bilal. Fine. If you need something, go to Hasan, don't get me involved. Now go and get your weekly payments, and don't let anyone know about this. This is even more than my weekly wage. And they call him a stingy man! We will buy Mustafa a wheelchair. Everyone is contributing. Nothing illegal about it. You gave your entire wage? Mustafa Abi, can I have that? Hold on there, first we have to pay for it. Here, let this be your first sale. Come on, make some more. You'll get used to it. He said, do with it as you will. I can build a house. A room here, a porch there. Master Bilal knows the mukhtar as well. -Maybe, we won't even have to pay. -But, how? Well, since we're workers, we get aid from the factory. -Salim Bey is the important one. -What about him? I'll help out with some circumcision feasts. Of course, that doesn't concern us. He is helping out couples who are about to get get married. - But, why? - Because he's a good man. He will give me the leftovers from the factory: bricks, wood, iron... Today, he paid me 200 lira more. Since, he's satisfied with our work, you know. -Why are you silent? -I don't know, Hasan. He wouldn't do all this, no strings attached. There are no strings, it's fine. I've been working like an animal. Who isn't? -I saw the machine today. -Which machine? The one you work at. I never saw it up close before. It's so strange, like a nightmare. I was afraid. There's nothing to fear. It's a machine, and my name is Hasan. So, put your mind at ease. We'll get over this, Salim Bey, don't worry. We will, no doubt... But they'll bring up the "work hours" again. If they have their way, we'll lose half our profit. No need to worry, Salim Bey. How many of these unionists are there? 5? Maybe 10? They can use the issue of work hours to convince more people to join them. It's best to come to an agreement. Who are you agreeing with, there? - Father, stay out of it. - What do you mean! How can you "agree" with those who work for you! Father, there are new laws, things you don't know about... And what is it that you know? When we came to this city, barefoot, you were a tiny baby, this high! I built that business by myself, carried each brick! You can't make a deal with those brutes, those peasants! They aren't "peasants" anymore, father, those days are over. Now, they are called "workers". Or, "labourers". Enough! What happened with that order? They'll give it to us. They won't "give it"! We, will take it! You will get the bigger share! The factory will grow, twice its size! You don't get this opportunity every day. Make use of it! As you wish, father. Fine. Now, you can drink. Two people have signed up for the union. -Did Hasim tell you? -Yes. Who are they? Macit, works at cutting. And Mürsel, works with him. They say they will put on the pressure to increase the wages. What are these guys, bandits? Will they steal from him? He pays more anyway when he likes you, right? Look how he paid us, much more than our wages. Fine, I'll let Master Bilal know. How much will you sell these for? Half a lira, 1 lira, these are for 2.5. It's good money, Mustafa. -For how long, though? -When winter comes, it's over. What are those balloons? My father was supposed to sell them, but he couldn't. Selling balloons is easy. He should come with me. Father. Sir, come with me, I'll show you how it's done. The balloons, we can sell them, easy. Let's go, sir. Aliye no longer comes around. She quit work as well. It's better this way. Why would she come? I was thinking... Those who visited us the other day, Master Muhsin, Mevlüt... Maybe they were right. We couldn't understand them. If we stood together, maybe they would have replaced that machine. And then, I would still be walking. The fault is not with the machine. -You can't do anything by force. -I'm not talking about force. They say they will sign a deal. The market is where you make a deal. You don't make deals with the man you work for! If it's the machine's fault, why hasn't anything happened to me? You should keep your eyes open! Be careful! If you don't do that... Forgive me. I didn't know. You didn't give us the candy! Forgive him, Mustafa. Hasan gets worked up, but his heart is in the right place. Friends, don't leave after you're done eating. Salim Bey wants to talk to you. Sit down, friends. Enjoy your meal. My friends... I'm keeping you here on your lunch break to give you good news. Our factory has received a big order. We know how much you produce each day. It will be difficult to make it on time. This might put us in a difficult situation. But, I wasn't afraid. Because you gave me courage. With a bit of sacrifice, I believe we can fulfill this order, God willing. -Am I right? -Of course. -We can do it. Thank you, thank you. Now all I ask of you... is that you work nights as well, for 30 days. That's all! Congratulations, sir. And thank you for putting your trust in us. But, how will we get paid for overtime? It will be as usual. That was before, Salim Bey. We haven't worked overtime in two years. Things have changed. What that means is, according to the latest regulations, overtime payments are required to be fifty percent more than our hourly rates. That's what the law says. -And then, there's that machine. -That again? It's dangerous for someone tired to be working there. We should take shifts. We can do that. I won't let you meddle with my earnings, Master Muhsin! I'll work there, I'll earn it! I'll work there for 24 hours! You mind your own business! That's it then. There's work if you want it. To be honest, I was expecting that from each one of you. But, it's up to you. -Greetings. -Hello. You can't go in. There's a meeting. - What meeting? - I don't know. Something's up in the union. They met in secret. They will hand out notices, I've heard. Hand out what? You know, like those papers from last time, "brothers", "let's stand together", what have you. Why do all this, when you can work hard and earn your keep. They're just lazy! Let them do that, then. I've brought soup, it's hot. You need it, since you're tired. Hacer. Since my mother's passing years ago, no one ever brought a bowl of soup to me. You have warmed my heart. You said you and I should watch out for each other, remember? I've thought about it, talked it over with Ms. Zehra too, she will look after the kids and my father. I'll work nights as well. If we are to make a home, we should do it together. The night shift is hard. After a while, a ringing starts in your ears, and it doesn't stop. You no longer even know what you're doing. Like you're part of the machine. -You can't handle it. -I can. I'll think of you, and hang on. I'll think of our home, and hang on. I have no one else in this world who gives me hope, Hasan. Stop it! Greetings. Hello. Step over there. Stop that! What's going on, Master Bilal, is this a factory or the customs office? It was necessary today. - By what law? - By my law. Wait, let me go! I'll show him! Are you afraid of being searched? It's not about being afraid. It's about democracy! -We couldn't find anything. -They must have gotten wind of it. Keep your eyes open. Of course, Master Bilal, don't worry about it. Hacer wants to work too, aga, can you put down her name as well? Sure. You two are saving up, I see? Together, we hardly get by. -So, you are together now. -Thanks to you. But I couldn't go to her father, and ask for her hand in marriage. -Because I have no one. -You have no one, you say. Is that what you think? Alright, let go. Off to work you go, now. Master Bilal. Are you alright, Mustafa? How can I be, you see how I am. Are you in pain? No, that's over. But the pain inside doesn't stop. You're right. But what can you do? It was fate. As you wish. Let's call it fate. -Greetings. -Hello. Mustafa Abi, we've sold so many! I've come to see you, Yunus Aga. Come in. Mr. Yunus is very strange. I did all the shouting. And, his hands were trembling. It's hard when you're not used to it. I also feel like tearing apart all these papers! He's a good kid. Very brave. I'm not saying this because he's from my hometown. He's a proper man. So, with your consent... What can I say, Bilal Aga. If they have settled on it... It'll be good for my daughter. He will take care of Erol and Cemile I assume? He'll be like a real father to them, don't you worry about that. It's settled, then. I am no longer afraid of dying. I always thought about what would happen to my daughter after I died. That's him. Hit him in the eyes, so he won't snitch on us. Hit him in the mouth, so he won't talk. Have at him. Enough! Enough! Tell me, was that enough? Mom! We watched the wrestling! -We'll come again, won't we? -Of course. If we get through this month, we will have saved 3000 lira. And, Salim Bey will give us a raise, for both of us. Friends will help out as well. We will start on the house. I look forward to your cooking, in our kitchen. Mr. Hasan, the wrestling started again! Can we go? Sure, we'll go. But, you need to eat first. Have you gotten used to it, Yunus? Once a tree has been uprooted it cannot be helped. We didn't know that. We thought a man can do without roots. We were wrong. There are those who can lay down roots anywhere, Yunus. That's not the issue. Farmers like you and I, we plant the seeds and leave the rest to God. That's all we know. It's not like that here. You can't get by if you don't ingratiate yourself to other people. That's the way it is. Sir. Let's go, we can find business inside. In my hometown, people would stand up when they'd see me, out of respect. Look at me now. Led by a child. -Can we have two börek? -Of course. Sir? Sir! Look at those great buildings. I can't stop looking. What good are they, they aren't meant for us. It's fine to aim high. -What? What happened! -Come, my girl. -What happened Ms. Zehra? Tell me! -Your father... Father! Hacer. It's no good, dying together with the dead. We share your pain. But, work would help take your mind off this pain. We shouldn't let this hinder our lives. We must go on. That's what your father would've wanted. Hasan is with you now. He will take care of you and your family from now on. Salim Bey sent this. He gives his condolences. It's for the funeral expenses, and a gift for your upcoming marriage. It covers them both. This was your father's will. Everything is ready. You will bring Hacer with you. Come on. ...Do you accept Hacer as this man's wife? I do. And do you accept Hasan as husband for this woman? I do. And, all present here, do you bear witness to this union? We do. ...God, please accept this marriage that has taken place in front of you and bless this couple and their families with your endless bounty... My daughter. It shall be four stories tall. -What's that? -Our house. We will rent out the other three floors. -Did you see it in your dream? -Yes. Let's hope it will become true. A single floor is enough as long as it's ours. As long as there are no wolves at our door. We can do more than just being content, you'll see. That's where the oven will be. We'll have a roof over our heads before winter. Bilal Aga told me, Salim Bey will eventually help everyone get a house. I wish we didn't have to vacate our home. I had the trees, my flowers. We will plant them here as well. That land was barren too before you planted those. And, a room for the kids. Why do you keep silent? Something's wrong with you. I don't know, Hasan. We're working day and night. We are no longer human. What are you saying, Hacer! As long as there's work, I'm up for it! There's nothing I can't do. -You started talking like those others. -Like who? Those unitar-ists, whatever they're called! They know only to do harm. Let them! But we will do good! -That's what Bilal Aga said. -I don't know. I wish someone could explain what's good and bad, so we'd know. Look here. Everything we have comes from them. Our jobs. Our money. They gave us each other. They gave us this house. They gave us everything! You call it a house, yet there is nothing but the wind over there. As for money, we can still hardly make ends meet. We're married, yet we still haven't gotten intimate, we're always tired. Hacer, stop talking crazy! Be thankful! -Being ungrateful is not for us. -Of course I'm thankful. But I'm also afraid. What if that Salim Bey and Master Bilal... What great toll will they exact in return for all their favors? Come on, move around a little bit. You'll get used to it! Come on. Yes, like that! Mustafa! I'm so happy for you. So, how is it? Is it comfortable? I'm happy for you, Mustafa. Thanks. May God bless you, you've made my son smile! We didn't do it, his friends paid for it, all of them. But you got them all together. You didn't forget about us. Hasan made the biggest contribution. He gave his entire weekly pay. Hasan, you could have been so much more, done so much more. If only you joined us. Come in, Master Bilal. -How are you, steward? -Thank you for asking, aga. He's not a steward, father. He's a foreman. You don't know anything, son. Have a seat, steward. Go ahead, sit down. -Where are you from? -From Cukurova, Ceyhan. Good, good. How are things at the factory? All good. We worked hard during this period. As you should! Always work hard! How are the peasants? Anyone making a fuss? A few, here and there. Nothing to worry about. Listen carefully, now. We're about to take another big contract. After a 15 day period, I'll want to see this hard work again! I want to see this effort for another 30 days! What do you say? Your word is our command, aga. We owe it all to you. My son is here. He'll tell you what's in it for you if you can pull this off. 2.5 percent of the profit will be yours. We'll give it with our blessing. Thank you. May God bless you! Hacer! Hacer, please come in. Welcome. Come this way. No need to be shy. We're so happy to see you here, at last. Friends, since we have Hacer on our side as well, they can't stop us. I've come here without telling him. Hasan doesn't know. Things are happening, and I can't make sense of them. Perhaps you could explain to me the truth of it all? Look, Ms. Hacer. First of all, know this. Our gathering here is all in accordance with the law. So, you don't need to be afraid or shy. As for the rest, your friends can explain it better. Please, let me do the talking... Could you, by yourself, knock on Salim Bey's door and say: "My wage is not enough, I need a raise"? You can't. But, if we all get together, we can sit down to make a deal with him and if he still refuses to meet our demands, then we can stop working! Then his factory will also stop working, and he will lose money. Only then will he say: "Alright, please come back to work, I will raise your wages". It's no different from bargaining. I'm not worried about the money, Mevlüt. Hasan... He's the only one I can lean on in this world. And Mustafa is our neighbour. I see what's happened to him, every day. Please, understand. You're right, Hacer. We can overcome that problem, too. But, it's all about acting together. First, we have to stand as one. My late father told me about the words of our prophet: "2 is better than 1. 3 is better than 2. And 4 is better than 3. Therefore, come together." We are almost finished, aga. We have made you proud! You act like you don't know how you've shamed me! What's the matter, aga? As if you don't know the mess you've made! -That woman of yours, she talked with unionists! -What! With whom! How does a man not know what his woman is up to! Hacer! -Have you seen Hasan? -He just left. Hasan is here, too! They're all coming, one by one! Now, they can't stop the flow of this river! -Greetings, Hasan. -This is no time for greetings! -Hacer has come here, is that right? -She has, so what? You twist everyone's minds, then you say "so what"! She won't come here again! We didn't force anyone, Hasan. If you have a problem, take it up with her! There was no harm in her coming here, my brother. Stop with the "brotherhood"! If she came here, it's bad for us all! All we want is a job! A job, to get paid! You listen to me, now! -You work with a machine, right? -Yes, so what! If a part of that machine malfunctions or is broken, what happens then? I don't know. They must have spare parts. See! That's what you are to them, a spare part! What did you just call me! Your father is "a spare part"! Let me go! Let me! I was worried about you. -You went to the union! -I did. You did! And you have shamed me! Shamed me in front of the man that provides our daily bread! I meant no harm, Hasan! I just wanted to hear what they had to say. -So that my fears wouldn't come to pass. -What are you afraid of! There, that's what I'm afraid of! Look, and see! -Sir, could you please come with me. -What is it now? It's a long story. You'd better see for yourself. What's going on here, Master Muhsin? It's nothing. He has come to visit his friends. These are work hours. We still have 15 minutes. And, we have the numbers now. Be ready to sign a deal with us soon. Here. This is our list. I see how it is... Then, we make that list right now, here. Some of you might have signed up for the union. And that's fine. That's the law. And the law is sharper than the sword. But, I don't want to see just names on a paper. We'll make that separation right now, in front of me. Unionists, you stay here. The rest, head over there. Let her go. No one can force each other. It's time, Master Bilal. You go back to work with the others. -So, we're being laid off? -No. I want to talk to you. Then, you can get back to work. What kind of a man are you! You've been playing both sides... First you suck up to me, then you send your wife to the union! After all I've done for you! May your house fall apart! May you starve out in the streets! I took pity on you, took you under my wing! And this is how you repay me! And you call yourself a man! You should let that snake woman of yours do all the talking for you, too! That does it. Take one last look at your machine. You won't be here for long. You will get the hell out of here! Hasan! What happened to you! Hasan! Hasan! Here's your pound of flesh! And who will pay our blood money! Who! Who! The machine is not at fault. It's not your fault, either. The fault is ours. Ours! The fault is ours! The fault lies with us. The End
