# When you were young and your heart # Was an open book # You used to say live and let live # You know you did # You know you did # But if this ever-changin' world in which we live in # Makes you give in and cry... # Look! Look! # Say live and let die # Live and let die # Live and let die # Live and let die. # This is the biggest stage in the world. My mind has been blown. I've never seen anything like that in my entire life. You came out here and you smashed it out of the ballpark! Unbelievable. Oh, my gosh! This is insane! They're actually lighting him on fire. No! Oh, my god! What have I signed onto? Manu, don't move. Don't move! Oh! Whoa! That is the future of performance. Behind you, it says, 'Australia's Got Talent', and that seems like an understatement. So thank you. Australia's Got Talent has the ability to launch careers, by one lucky break, and do you know how they can come? They can come in gold. What? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) CROWD: AGT! AGT! AGT! Come on, Australia. I'm ready for you, baby! Numbers 112 and 113, it's time to go to stage. Are you ready to meet your Australia's Got Talent judges? Shane Jacobson! # Ooh, singin' # Ooh, singin'... # Give it up for Lucy Durack! # I'm so in love with you. # Raise the roof for Manu! Bon appetit. I think I'm ready. Nicole Scherzinger! Cameras, standing by. Are you ready for Australia's Got Talent, 2019? How about we get this party started! Whoo! I wonder what we can expect. I'm really excited. Expect the unexpected, right? This is it, huh? OK, we gotta go. They're ready for you. Are you ready? I'm ready. Are you ready? Can I hold this? Yes. Just hold it. Like that? Yes. Come on, put us on the edge of our seat. You can do it. Hi. Welcome. How's it going? Great. What's your name? My name is Alex Magala. Welcome... Thank you. ..to Australia's Got Talent. Oh, my god, you guys are looking beautiful. (LAUGHTER) Alex, what are you going to be doing for us? Well, I'm a martial artist and a sword swallower. Oh. And these two passions allows me to travel around the world and do what I love. Wow. And I'm so excited. I actually prepared something special for you guys. Oh. Wow. So, it's very dangerous. Wow. I'm gonna risk my life. Oh, my goodness. I want to leave it as a surprise, but I'm just gonna put my life on the line and tonight is gonna be another level up and I'm happy to perform it here. Thank you so much, Alex. Yeah, thank you. Let me take off my clothes 'cause it's hot. He just goes so quickly from, like, sweet to, like, death. But I just don't know what's gonna come next. Thank you. That's not knife, is it? No. Oh. Gooluck. Be safe. His body is, like, hardcore. Hello. Wow. It's kinda like your body, right, Manu? Yeah. It's just like looking in the mirror. Oh, my god. That looks very sharp. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) No! Oh, my gosh! Oh! Oh! Oh, my... Do not try that at home. Oh, no, don't keep the knife in. Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye-aye! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh. I cannot believe my eyes. It's like he's in space or something. Oh, no! That's not a knife. That's a knife. Oh! No, no, no, don't! Oh, my god, no! No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! Oh, no, don't do more of this. No, don't go to the ropes! He's not going to do that. He's climbing. He's climbing, look. Stop! He's gonna drop down. He's gonna come down face down, face down. Oh, my gosh. Oh, shit! No! (ALL SCREAM) Oh... my... god. Did you see how close he got to that ground? Are you mental? Yes, he is. I'm scared! I'm scared. I know! I'm like... I wanna clap, but I wanna cry. That was insane. Just for you to be on those bands alone is hard enough, and then you did it with a sword in your face-hole? He just shoved that thing down his face-hole and it was all swimmin' around in his stomach, and then he was doing backflips and looking beautiful. And then moonwalking in the air and I'm like, "What?" I thought I'd seen it all. I thought I'd heard it all until I heard the word, 'face-hole.' (LAUGHTER) Alex, that is the most uncomfortable I have ever been watching a piece of entertainment, so I have two things to say to you. Goddamn you. And, god, that was good. Thank you so much. Thank you. Alex, that was so compelling. If I saw that on TV, I would think that there were special effects involved. It was like you were in space. Like, that was bananas. Yeah. Appreciate it, thank you. You're amazing. Your strength and all your energy and your artistic ways. I really enjoyed what you did tonight. Thank you so much. Thank you. I'm gonna kick off the voting with a 'please don't try this at home' yes. First yes, from Shane. Yes, I agree. Don't do this. Leave it to Alex. You've got this. It's a yes. Thank you. Thank you so much. Two yeses. I think you're absolutely crazy, but it's a yes, from me, mate. Thank you. Three yeses. You have four insane yeses. Thank you. Thank you so much, guys. Congratulations. Thank you all. No wonder he has to be so fit, because he has to have the strength to keep this aligned. That... ..is crazy. Congratulations. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. I feel bad for whoever's next. I would not want to be next. How do you get better than that? Yeah, I know. I do not know. I don't know. ('HABANERA' FROM BIZET'S CARMEN) That's sick. My name's Gavin Sempel, I'm 21 and I'm a telemarketer at a call centre. 'G' for 'Gav Dog'. What are you doing tonight, Gavin? Just gonna tell some jokes. Do some stand-up comedy. Awesome. What made you get into stand-up? I dropped out of law school to do comedy. Oh, wow! Yeah. Yeah, because lawyers don't get paid enough. "Hey, I'll go into comedy. That's gonna pay the bills." Dad, how did you feel about, uh, dropping out of law school? Oh, I wasn't impressed. Was not impressed. Uh-uh. You should have worn a collared shirt, like a uni student. No way. I am single. I was in a relationship last year, but she actually broke up by text, and then a week later, moved up to the Gold Coast. It's an easy way to do it, not gonna lie. She was very efficient. Actually, I do need to pee first. If you get past this stage, will you go back to law? No! I'm not going back to uni. Why not? Comedy's gotta go well soon. Who wants to see the next act? If I bomb on national television, oof. I think I probably need the practice. Just try it. What are you hoping happens out there? Oh, they bloody laugh. "Thebloody laugh"! Alright, they're ready for you. Good luck! How's it goin'? Hi, babe. What's your name and where are you from? My name's Gavin. I'm from Gippsland, Victoria. Taking it all in, Gavin? Yeah, this is bigger than my town at home. This is sick. What do you do for a living, Gavin? I am a telemarketer at a call centre. Livin' the dream. Livin' the dream. What are you doing for us tonight? I'm gonna tell some comedy. Do some gags. Why AGT? I chose to do this 'cause I actually dropped out of law school to do comedy, so I really wanna prove Dad wrong, to be honest. You have anyone with you tonight? Yeah, I got my disapproving father and... Well, let's try to prove him wrong. Have fun out there. No worries. Sick. Hey, I am from Gippsland, guys. I'm a Gippy boy, ho! Right? Good stuff. But my town was recently affected by the bushfires a couple of months ago, which was not good. And we got, like, the notification from the CFA. They're like, "You need to evacuate. You need to get out of here." But for some reason, my dad's a hero. He said, "I'm not going anywhere. We're gonna fight this fire. Get the hoses, Gavin. Get the pumps. When this fire comes over the hill, we're gonna take it on." And I was like, "Dad, we're renting. Like, this is a Commission house. Let the government fight the fire, you buffoon. What are you doing?" No, the thing about me is, I used to work in fast food for six years. I'm a real hero. But the thing about out in the country, right? It's fairly racist, unfortunately, and I had this one racist customer come up to me. He's like, "Hey, man, can I get a ham and cheese toastie?" It's like, "Yeah, man, 2.50, it's all yours." But he's like, "Is that ham on the toastie halal ham? Is that halal - certified ham on the toastie? 'Cause I only want true Australian ham on my toasties." He said, "I only want Australian ham between my bread." I was like, "Mate, to be fair, I don't even think it's ham." Because I live in the country, I'm always catching the V-Line into the city, which is sick. I had this guy come up to me, right? Which is always what you want on the public transport. And he comes up, he's like, "Hey, man, just wanna let you know that you look like a famous person." I was like, "Sick, comedy's going well." He's like, "Nah, I just wanna let you know that you look like Keira Knightley, if she had a moustache." Another thing I've been told is I've been told I look like Captain America before he's injected with the super-serum. The best one is, I've been told I look like Nicholas Cage, if he had an ice addiction, so... It's like, "You got me, Grandad, you cheeky bugger." Thank you very much! Whoo! That was awesome! Gavin! I'm just gonna cut straight to the point. I fricken love you so hard. Thank you very much. You are my Captain Australia, is what you are. Gavin, you had me at the Pasito t-shirt with a sausage sizzle on there. Everyone loves a bloody snag. Yeah. I dropped out of law school also to become a performer. Sick. Represent. So I have, like, a kind of vested interest in you. Your parents are actually backstage, as well. I don't think you knew. We got them in. We did it. Mate, I'm from Melbourne and that makes both of us from Victoria. I'm so glad we can prove that some of the great comedy comes out of this state, and it's so great it comes out of Gippsland. Thanks, man. Do you mind bringing your dad out? Yeah, get out here, Dad. "Get out here, Dad!" Give it up for him. What's your name, Dad? Gavin's dad. Yeah, OK. He's a comedian, too. Did you laugh when your son said to you that he was dropping law school? Was it funny for you? No! Do you understand why he's done it now? No! Do you understand why? UDIENCE: Yeah! Hey. Hey, Dad? This is gonna be really annoying. You ready? Watch how fast this happens. It's a yes, from me. It's a yes, from me. It's a yes, from me. It's a yes, from me. Thank you very much! Fist bump. Sick. You crushed it! Thank you very much. Thatas so awesome. I just shit my pants. I love - I love that type of humour. The second he started, I heard you giggling. I was, like, laughing, like, hard. I was like, "Ha-ha-ha!" Dad, what do you think? Yeah, no. He can keepoing stand-up? For now, yeah. For now? Alright. Oh! Coolest thing I've seen. This is like starting again. They say laughter's the best medicine. I just OD'd. There's a big chance that things could go horribly wrong. No, no, no, no, no! Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god! You are the real deal. The only thing left, really... And... Yah! This kid isine years old! Yeah! Yeah, I do a lot of Instagramming. # Get you in the selfie # On the side, I'll get you in the selfie... # Why I got famous that way on the internet was just, I'm alone in a room, so it's me on a webcam. When you say 'viral', how many views are we talking? There was one that was, like, 39 million. I mean, that's more than the population of Australia. There's one video on Instagram, and it's at 14 million views. # I'm so popular... # Oh, what's that? Oh, what's that? Then Ellen saw my Instagram and she said, "I should have him on." - You performed on 'Ellen'? - Yeah. - How amazing was that? - It was good. - Yeah? - She's very funny. Amazing. Well, good luck. He's so cute! So cute. Hey, buddy. How're you doing? What's your name? I'm Taj. I'm nine and I'm from Long Jetty. Are you Taj's dad? Yep. Taj. No worries. And you are nine. Yes. The guitar's bigger than you are. Yeah, kinda. So, mate, I assume you're going to play guitar for us here today, yeah? Yeah. So, mate, what got you into playing guitar? My dad and my pop took me to an AC/DC concert 2.5 years ago, and I said, "I wanna do that for the rest of my life." There you go. When he was, like, six years old. Six years old. Partway through the gig, he wanted to get up on my shoulders for a better look, 'cause everyone stood up. And I saw Angus Young play 'Shook Me All Night Long'. I looked down at Dad and go, "I'm doin' this." And I said, "I wanna do that for the rest of my life." Yeah, something happened to him that night and it was just - it was crazy. He's obsessed. So, I love guitar. Who doesn't love a good rock tune, mate? Let there be rock. Thank you. (PLAYS ELECTRIC GUITAR) Hey! Yeah! Come on! ('BACK IN BLACK' BY AC/DC) He's just so cool! Ahh! This kid is nine years old. Yes! Yes! Man! Taj. Taj. Oh, my gosh! Mate, you are the real deal. Man, you're nine? Yeah. I do look about 12, but I'm nine. Mate, you... He looks about five. You play like you've been playing for, like, four other people's lives. You had your eyes closed. I was watching you there. I watched your hands for a while, but you had your eyes shut. You were doing it like... ..well, like a professional, mate. That is unbelievable. Thank you. You are - you are it, man. You... Man, I'm your number one fan. And I don't know what your Instagram page is, but I'm gonna be all over you for the rest of your life. Thank you. Taj Farrant, you are a bona fide rock legend. Thank you. Thank you so much. It's alright. I love rock music. You probably don't know this about me because, you know, you're two. But I felt like, if I closed my eyes, I felt like I was at a rock concert. Yeah. And I'm gonna try to make sure I say this the right way, but normally at rock concerts in America, chicks are, like, taking their bras off and stuff. No, but I would keep... OK, go, go, go! And I would be like - I would just... And now he's traumatised. Manu? I'm just kind of jealous. Like, nine years old, you're so cool, you're so relaxed, you play guitar like crazy. Have you got a manager? Yeah, it's my dad. Damn! My dadenger. Yeah, he's got patter! Like, fantastic, buddy. thank you. hat's alright. Taj Farrant. AUDIENCE: Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold! We might have a golden buzzer. Golden buzzer. Taj Farrant, you're a bona fide rock star. I'm gonna follow your career for the rest of my life. It's a yes, from me, buddy. Thank you. Taj, it is a yes from me. Thank you. I can't wait to hear you make that puppy sing and soar again. It's a yes, from me. Thank you. There's definitely no doubt. It's a yes, from me. Four yeses. Whoo! See ya, Taj Farrant! # I'll get higher and higher... # So, how does that compare - to being on 'Ellen'? - There's more people. There's more people. It's better, right? It was a great crowd, wasn't it? This is the biggest show on the planet. This is Australia's Got Talent! From the age of five, I've always been into superheroes. The technology I work with lets me create whole other levels, whole other dimensions and storylines and characters. I grew up in a bookshop. Lots of comics, always exposed to superheroes, always exposed to science fiction, and it's definitely created who I am. I'm Peter Vosper, director of Vospertron. The name, Vospertron, comes from my last name, Vosper, and of course Tron, who's the mythical glowing hero of the '80s. Vospertron is sort of like a collision of technology and darkness. It lets me create the impossible, make it possible. Bringing superheroes to life. We can teleport, we can have superpowers. It's pretty exciting. Alright, Peter, I don't know what to expect from this. Good luck. Thank you. Hi, mate. How're you doing? What's your name? My name's Peter, Peter Vosper. I'm from Vospertron. What are you going to do for us here tonight on Australia's Got Talent? I'm going to show you some lights. You're gonna show us some lights? What does that mean? UmI'll show you. - Hold on. - Oh, here we go. Oh. (MAGICAL, TWINKLY MUSIC) That is so beautiful. Oh, wow. Oh. It's like Tron! It's Tron! (DANCE MUSIC PLAYS) Alien. Oh, my god, that's beautiful! So beautiful. Oh, my god. Oh! Wow! Yes! That was amazing! What was that? So good! Um... yeah. That was, uh... That was - wow. What a trip. Um, no-one just slipped me something, did they? I think I just saw all that. That was fantastic. Where did the idea come from? Yeah, just, I love the motion and the lights and seeing the... I've been mesmerised for years. We're very lucky to collaborate with this crazy, crazy genius, Peter Vosper. He's so passionate. He's been doing this for over 15 years, playing with these suits. He's an amazing person and thank you very much. Peter, you're a genius. I felt like that is the future of performance, literally. Thank you. Awesome. You are like electronic dancing human fireworks. Can I keep that? That's great. Thank you so much. This is definitely the coolest thing I've seen so far. So, you know how this works, yeah? You've gotta get three yeses to go through to the next round. That's how this works. Here's your first one. It's a yes, from me. I'm not sure if I can get away with saying this, but it's a fully lit yes, from me. fully lit yes from Lucy. Two yeses. It's a yes, from me. Three yeses. Have you got different costumes for the next... Different choreography, different music, different lighting, different everything, different whole experience. Hello! What are you doing? Alright, it's a yes, then! Four yeses! # Teenage wasteland... # Congratulations. We'll see you in the next round! # Teenage wasteland. # Oh, my god! # Teenage wasteland. # Hey, you guys, congratulations. That was amazing! Yay! That was so awesome. I almost thought about the golden buzzer for that. Yeah. Really? Guys, that's the future of performance, right there. # Teenage wasteland # It's only teenage wasteland. # Everybody will be in shock. The worst act we've had on this show. I'm about to go on. I haven't sung anything for the last 15 years. Some people might recognise me from 'The Bachelorette'. Oh! And I'm willing to risk my life. I don't feel very good about this. Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god! This is the biggest stage in the world. We're looking for unbelievable acts. This stage is a conveyor belt of surprises. We never know what's coming out. That's what's exciting. Hello. This is Thumbelina, the miniature reindeer. What are youere for today? We have a few tricks. Take the stage and show us what you can do. It's just a horse with a headband. My kids at school said I have to finish with an explosion. Hands over your ears. (TINY POP) Errrrr. That was actually the worst act we've had on this show. It can only get better. My name's Apollo. People might recognise me as one of the guys looking for love on 'The Bachelorette', but I want to be known as Apollo the Professional Magician. What brings you to Australia's Got Talent and why now? I had an amazing time on my shows but, coming off them, I felt like what I do as a profession was seen more as a gimmick. I've always had a massive passion for entertaining. By seven, I was heavily into magic and everywhere I went, I was performing. But I've been trying to be a full-time magician for 12 years now, and there has been so many setbacks. After 'The Bachelorette', work really dried up super quickly. I've had to do whatever I can to pay the bills. I've worked in security, landscaping, telemarketing, hospitality. There's moments when things get really hard and, in the back of your mind, you do feel like giving up. Right now is one of those times. My phone's cut off, I'm living at home, I'm super-broke. - Hey, Mum. - Hello! I'm so nervous. Don't be nervous. Just remember how awesome you are. It is a dream come true for you! I know, I know. This is, like, the biggest opportunity to showcase what I do, so. I'm really nervous about today's performance. I have never performed this in front of anyone before, and there is a chance that things could go seriously wrong. Can't they just sing? And if you need any help, just call halt. We'll come straight in, OK? Yes, yes. I'm here to prove that my magic's not just a gimmick and I'm here to be taken seriously, and I'm willing to risk my life on stage for this. Can we get a medic on standby, please? Oh! This is normally the bit where we say, "Hi. What's your name?" But I know exactly who you are. Hey, guys. It's Apollo, guys, from 'The Bachelorette'. Whoo! Why are you - why are you in a straitjacket right now? I'm here to show Australia what my profession is, what I'm passionate about and what I can do. What are you going to do today? So, in a straitjacket, I'm going to be suspended from the ceiling, to a pulley system set to incrementally drop me face-first toward a bed of razor-sharp flaming spikes. Oh, my gosh. The only way to stophe drop system is a switch located in a locked and chained box outside of reach. Oh! Oh, my gosh. And to take this escape to the next level, I'm going to be doused in gasoline, and my whole body will be engulfed in flames. Whoa. Wait, you're going to be on fire right now, on stage? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not gonna lie. There's a massive, massive element of danger in tonight's escape. It's, uh... It's very real and there's a big chance that things could go horribly wrong. Let's do this. Good luck, mate. Good luck. So, what could go wrong with this? I don't know what's gonna happen, but death is definitely on the cards with this one. Oh. Oh, god. Oh! I smell that. I can smell it, too. I... It just smells like gasoline. OK, so that's the bobby pin to unpick the lock. I don't feel - I don't feel very good about this. Oh, my goodness. Oh, my god, I don't want him - he can't be put on fire. He cannot be put on fire. I can't see him put on fire. He's - he's covered in that kerosene. This is not alright. He's covered. No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! They're actually lighting him on fire. Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god! No! No! Oh, my god, no! Oh, my god! Ahh! Oh, my god. His whole arm's on fire, isn't it? Oh, my gosh! His arm is on fire! Oh, my god. Oh, no. Oh, no! Oh, my god! Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up! Oh, my god, his arm is on fire. His arm is on fire! Oh, my gosh. His arm's on fire. The lock's gone. The lock's gone. Come on, come on, come on, come on! # I'm waking up to ash and dust # I wipe my brow # And I sweat my rust # I'm breathing in the chemicals... # Wow. # I'm breaking in, shaping up # Then checking out on the prison bus... # He is literally smoking. Yeah. He's smoking. # I'm waking up # I feel it in my bones # Enough to make my systems blow... # I'm traumatised. Can I ask auick question? Were you freaking out when your hand was on fire? That's the danger of what I do. A lot of this stuff that I do is 100% real. Is your... Your hands are bleeding. Your hand's bleeding. That's real blood. Oh, my... Oh, my gosh. That is, by far, most dangerous thing I know I've seen on that stage. Yeah. I'm... I'm speechless. Thank you so much. I kind of want to say, "Don't do that again," but that's kind of your whole thing, isn't it? Yeah, Mum's always been like, "Oh, why can't you just do something chilled and something safe?" But it's not really in my nature. That's, uh... That's not an illusion, that's just dangerous. And so, from that point of view, well done, man. Well done. Thanyou very much. I'm gonna start. Shall I start the vote? I just loved it and I wanna see some more. It's a yes, from me! You actually risked your life up there today for us. I believed that. It's an absolute yes, from me. I found that unbearable but, like, I want you to come back again. So it's a yes, from me. Thank you. Can't give you a rose, but I can give you a yes. Please come back. That's insane. Congratulations. - Thank you guys so much. - See you soon, buddy. You got cojones, amigo. You're - you're - you're insane, but amazing at the same time. I love it and I'm so excited that you're coming back for another round and I can't wait - to see what you do to up that. - Well, I'm gonna enjoy showing - Australia some more crazy stuff. - Yeah. I think you're going to also - enjoy a shower right now. - Yeah, I know. - Sorry about the stench. - No, no, no, it's amazing. I love it. (VOCALISING) My name's Jennifer Anderson and I'm from Melbourne. I am a classical singer and a full-time stay-at-home mother. I do all my singing training at home. I've actually set up a little carpet-baffle booth so that I can stand in the corner of the bedroom and do all my training, and not disturb the neighbours. So stand in the corner, sing to the carpet. I love classical music. Mozart is a definite top of the list. How long have you been singing for? Oh, my whole, very long life. I think part of the reason it's such a big moment for me is my age. I mean, come on, elephant in the room. I'm 50 years old. I haven't sung anything at all for the last 15 years. - How're you feeling, beautiful? - Oh, really scared. Don't be really scared. You ready? - Yeah, I am. - Breath. - I'm ready. - Out you go. If there's ever gonna be an opportunity, this is it. Hello. Hello. Hi. What's your name? Jennifer Anderson is my name. Jennifer, what do you do for work? I am a full-time stay-at-home mum, actually. Aw, and what are you going to do for us tonight? I'm going to sing one of Puccini's classic arias. Ahh, cool. Wow. So, what do your kids think of your singing? Well, they hear me sing around the house, but they've never seen this. Wow. Well, Jennifer, without further ado, just sing with all your heart. We're right behind you. Thank you. Appreciate it. ('O MIO BABBINO CARO' BY PUCCINI) What a voice. (MUSIC STOPS, ROCK SONG STARTS) # Oh, yeah! # Oh, my god. # Ooh, a storis threat'ning # Ooh, a storm is breaking # My very life today # If I don't get no shelter # Oh, I think I'm gonna fade away # Woah, children # It's just a shot away # It's just a shot away # War # Gimme shelter # I need shelter # Gimme shelter # Shelter # Oh # Hey! # What! # Yeah! # Yes! Come on! Oh, my gosh! Come on! Standing ovation from the whole crowd. # If you wake up and don't want to smile # If it takes just a little while # Open your eyes and look at the day # You'll see things in a different way. # Jennifer! You just blew the roof off this place. Thank you. That was bonkers. Thank you. I love you. The opera alone was so moving. I sing, I'm a first soprano, so I was like, "Oh, my gosh, the vocal control." And then you just ripped your clothes off and you were like, # Wahhh! # And I was like, "Yes!" We were all like, "Ahh, what?" Why did you take so long to get on stage? Um... Your voice started amazing. Thank you. And then it stopped. And I went, "Oh, here we go." And then, bang, rock and roll happened! Yeah. There's, like, no end to what you can do with that voice. Thank you. You're just this opera and rock goddess. Congratulations. Thank you. That was amazing. Yeah. Thank you. Blew my mind. Super badass. So, you just sing at home? Can we have your home address so we can come to your gigs? The fact that you did both of those at the same time, it answers a question that we always have at this desk, which is, "What else have you got?" Well, we've seen you've got a whole lot going on. Get out of your house, get back on the stage. Here's your first yes. Yes. Thankou. Thank you! Let's have a lot less time between drinks. It's a second yes, from me. - Thank you. - Two yeses. Three yeses, darling. Thank you. Jennifer, you've got four yeses. Thank you. Well done. Um, excuse me. She's amazing. That was great to do both. That was so cool. It was so surprising. She's got a great range. I'm so shocked and amazed and I wanna be like you. Oh, don't be stupid. You're awesome. That was amazing. That was amazing. # Yeah! # # Yeahhh! # I'm going to be creating an artwork. You have such a beautiful gift. It's mesmerising. Australia's Got Talent. I have 5% vision. It's gotten progressively worse throughout my life. What's happening here? Where is everything? OK, so, this is a room where... I gathered that. I want Australia to see what I can do. What I do is mind readings. What am I thinking? He'still thinking. I took something from you. Here is your watch! Ahh! The thing about magic is you can make anything happen. Therand illusion. A higher level of consciousness, you know? That was magic. I really - I believe in magic. It challenged what you believe to be true. How did they do that, you guys? I don't know. I don't know. My name is Lioz Shem Tov. I am a magician and I am from Israel. I have the ability to read people's minds... ..and to move objects, only with my mind. When I was a child, I always thought that my powers are a curse because nobody wanted to be around me. Kids were afraid for me. Today, I'm feeling it's a bless. I can do amazing things. I can help people. And also, I can entertain with those powers. First, I was on 'Israel's Got Talent'. Everybody were in shock. And now I'm going to do Australia's Got Talent. And everybody... will be in shock. What've we got? What've we got? What've we got? Wow. Strut. Very serious. Good evening. Good evening. What's your name? I'm Lioz. Lioz? And I'm a mentalist. A mentalist. Ooh. Where are you from? I am from Israel. Do you live in Australia? No, I came specially for Australia's Got Talent. Wow. All the way from Israel. I want to show my talent to the world. OK, so, a mentalist. Are you doing a little bit of magic, too? What I do is mind readings. - Yes. - And telekinesis. Well, I say welcome to Australia, and this is your stage and just go with it. Thank you. He's mesmerising. He is. First, I need a volunteer from the audience. Would you like to come up on stage? Me? Yes. Let's give her a round of applause. OK. Don't give him your PIN number in your mind, Lucy. Oh, my god, I don't know how to not do that. What's your name? Lucy. Lucy. Say the truth. Is that you? Yes. That is me. Lucy. Take it. OK. Here, I have a rope. I want you to cut the rope wherever you want. Mazel tov. Thank you. He's hilarious. He's hungry. He wants to eat. Do something. Be gentle with that. Sorry. No, no, be gentle. You will destroy the scissor. Oh, no. What am I doing? No, what are you doing? Do - would you like me to... No, what are you doing? Just hold it for a second. There youo. Go! Come on. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, Lucy, do it. Good. It's not your first time. He's hilarious. Now it's my turn. Let's give Lucy a round of applause. But wait! I took something from you while you were up on stage. Check good. What did I take from you? Check good. Um... I took something from you. Um... Heris your watch! Thank you. Oh, excellent. And you! Yes? I took somethinfrom you, too. Check good. What did I take from you? Check good. I took something from you. Your watch! And you! I took something from you, too. What is missing? Check good. What is missing? Check good. My watch? My watch? No, your wallet! And what's inside? Your watch! And you. Check good. I take something from you, too. Your enlargement pump! - Ahh! No! - And what's inside? Your watch! And finally, I took something from you, too. Another thing. Check good. What did I take from you? Another watch? No. Your urine test! And I tell you what you're missing. Magnesium. Magnesium. Thank you very much. Thank you. I love Australia. I love you all. You've been amazing. Thank you. Oh, my god. You know, all I ask when I see a comedian is... It's magic. It's not comedy. Sorry, I-I made a mistake. Regardless, all I wanted from you is laughter, and I laughed hard, - my belly hurts. Thank you. - Thank you very much. Thank you. Ahh... For me, it's all in the delivery, man. Like, nobody has had delivery like that on this stage. It's all in the delivery. Thank you. I didn't expect it. Thank you. I love that all of us watching today and at home watching Australia's Got Talent now have, like, an in-joke of, "Your watch!" That was freaking hilarious. They say laughter's the best medicine. I just OD'd. You just seemed like the most awkward human on the planet. Thank you. Oh, jeez. I can't even speak. Who cares! I'm going to the vote. Yes. Thank you so much. Lioz, it's a yes! Thank you for my watch back. It's a yes. It's a yes! Thank you. Thank you very much. I love you. You kinda don't know if he's joking or not. Look, there's the AGT sign. It's cool. Ooh. So, a big day, mate. Yeah. What do you mean? Just your hankie, Paul. Oh, the pocket square? The pocket square. # You've got a friend in me... # Ahh, high-five. Yeah! I am proud of ya, mate. You know it. Mmm. Good luck, sweetie. Love you. Whatever the outcome, alright, mate? Anything at all, you know I'm proud. And I've said that from day one and I'll say it again and again, OK? Love you, Mum. Love you, too, sweetheart. Alright, the time has come. Ahh. Go get 'em. Thank you. # But you've got a friend in me. # We have the judges. We have Manu, we have Lucy... Yep, OK. Sure, sure. Well. Hello. Who do we have here? My name is Paul Kapeleris. Hi, Paul. My name is Nicole and welcome to Australia's Got Talent. Thank you so much. It's an honour. May I ask who the lovely woman is that just walked you out? So, that was my mum. She gave me a hand 'cause I can't really see anything. So she was just pointing out where to go and who the lovely judges are. What's happen - what's happening here? Where is everything? OK, so, this is a room where... I gathered that. Well... I have Leber's amaurosis. It's a very rare condition that affects very few people. I have about 5% vision. It's gotten progressively worse throughout my life. School for me was mostly really fun. I tried to be just like everyone else. I would always want to play with the other kids. They'd run around and I'd try to chase them, and I'd hit a wall or crash into the floor. My mum is my biggest fan. She does all the running around, does all the crazy mum things, and I just thank and love her for that. You may not have your vision, but you've got everything else and you're using it to the best of your ability. That's all we can ask for, mate. That's all we can ask for. She's also nuts. But, like, you know, aren't we all? I'm a blubbering idiot. I'm a nut. You are. You're my nut. I embarrass you. I embarrass you all the time when I do whatever I do. You do. Yep. But, that's what mums are for. Mm-hm. I'm curious. Like, where would you want this to take you? What is your dream? I want Australia to see what I can do and what I'm capable of, and I just think it's the right time. Awesome. I love that. Well, the stage is yours, this is your time, so take it. Thank you. # You're broken down and tired # Of living life on a merry-go-round # And you can't find the fighter # But I see you # So we gonna work it out # And move mountains # We gonna walk it out and move mountains # And I'll rise up # I'll rise like the day # I'll rise up # I'll rise unafraid # I'll rise up # And I'll do it a thousand times again # And for you # For you # For you # For you # All we need # All we need is hope # And for that, we have each other # And for that, we have each other # We will rise # We will rise # We will rise up now # We will rise # And I'll rise up # Rise like the day # I'll rise up in spite of the ache # I'll rise up # And do it a thousand time again # And we'll rise up # High like the waves # We'll rise up in spite of the ache # We'll rise up # And we'll do it a thousand times again # For you # For you # For you # For you. # Standing ovation. Come and look at this crowd. AUDIENCE: Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold! He has no idea that they were standing up for him. He has no idea. Oh, my gosh. Paul, I'm crying my face off right now. You have such a beautiful gift and I'm so grateful that you graced - I mean, Australia's Got Talent, guys! You are the reason why I flew here. I mean, this is the reason why I came. Stop! Ahh, it's Manu here if you don't recognise the French accent. Oh, I do. Believe me, I do. I've got just one word coming out of my mouth. It's just 'beautiful', you know? It's just pure and beautiful and I love you for you-hoo-hoo. # Thank you. Paul, hi. It's Lucy here. Hi. Hi. That was magic. That was absolutely why we all came, is to hear -I mean, you have such a magnificent voice, but you sing with such honesty and heart. And I mean, the only thing left, really... I mean, the only thing left, really... # When the sharpest words wanna cut me down # Gonna send a flood # Gonna drown them out This is brave # This is bruised # This is who I'm meant to be... # You got the gold! # This is me. # Get up there, Lucy! Paul, I'm coming up. I'm coming behind you to give you a hug. # This is me! # Thank you so much. That was so beautiful, and you gave us all a huge gift. Thank you. And you are just - you're such an inspiration to me and to all of us here. And, Mum. So good. Oh, my god, Paul! You got a golden buzzer! That's the stuff I live for. That's the stuff I live for. So, the judges only get one golden buzzer for the entire auditions. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. And Lucy used that on you. Oh, my god. That's how much she was moved by that performance. Oh, my god. So that golden buzzer means that you're going straight to the semi-finals. Oh, my god! I just feel so honoured that I've been given an opportunity and... You've got a hanky to wipe your tears. Oh, I do. ou deserve it. # Oh, this is me! # I feel like I'm in the presence of greatness. I'm Australia's most prolific artist. Wow! I've never seen anything like that. I have so many questions. You love art, don't you? I love art. I love... What, as in, like, literally hand-drawn art? Yes, I love Joan Miro, Jackson Pollock, van Gogh, I love Picasso. I just love art, and there's been a lot of art on the show. Yeah. Yeah. What's your act? I'll be creating an artwork tonight. An artwork? Yeah. Live on stage? Yes. Oh, my gosh. We've seen a lot of different acts of many kinds, but this is just unique. Thank you. My usual job is I work as an artist 9-5. My passion in life really is performing and showcasing my artwork. That was such a generous performance. It's such - I was really moved by that. We haven't seen anything like that. I'm Tim Patch and I paint portraits. I always loved creating stuff. Gives me a feeling of fulfilment. I got divorced a long time ago. I thought, "Well, that was a waste of a life. You know, I've gotta do something that I wanna do now." I used to be a builder, carpenter, for half my life. Everyone in my family has been artistic. I like the old, the old painters better than the modern. I prefer looking at something like an old seascape, you know, and battles and things like that. I love that. The big dream for me would be to get my art more in the mainstream. How long have you been an artist for? - 15 years. - And do you sell your works? I'm probably Australia's most prolific artist. I feel like an idiot! Wow! I feel like I'm in the presence of greatness. This is amazing. What is this act? It's fair to say that I've got a very special talent. Quite unique, really. Hey. Wow! That... That is a lot to take in, right there. What is your name? My name is Pricasso. Pricasso, how young are you? In two months' time, I'll be 70 years old. Oh, my gosh! Abs of steel! Take a sweet look at that, Shane. Alright. Wow. What are you going to do for us today? I'm going to paint a picture of one of you... ..using my willy. Hence Pricasso. Well, happy... painting? Wahey. Oh, my god! # Baby, take off your coat # Real slow... # Oh, my gosh! Oh! Oh! What is happening? Eugh! He's literally painting with his willy! Oh, my god. He's using it like it's a paintbrush! # You can leave your hat on... # Oh, my god, it's Shane! # You can leave your hat on # You can leave your hat on. It's you, Shane! It's a very, very good likeness. You can't see what I can see! Ricki-Lee's seeing the whole thing. # Ooh-hoo-hoo # You can leave your hat on # You can leave your hat on. # It's dripping with paint! # If you want my body and you think I'm sexy # Come on, sugar, let me know... # I have so many questions. Hang on, it's not finished. I think, Shane, you should go and sign it. No, you don't have to use your willy. No, no, no. Where's the... I'll do it with the paint. Here we go. Yay, his willy's been in there! Don't put your finger in the art! There you go. Thank you. You've got a lot of paint on your... Oh! Wow. That is crazy. I've never seen anything like that. It's actually beautiful. The shading. The truth is that we're here to judge talent. The actual painting itself does look like me. Yes! Yeah. Thank you. And we loved it, so it's a yes, from me. Do you have talent? - AUDIENCE: Yes! - Thank you. Congratulations. It's a yes, from me. I love you, Pricasso. I can't wait till you come back. You've got three yeses. You know what? It's just a yes, from me, too, mate. You're fantastic. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Thank you, my friend. Well done. Give him a round of applause, ladies and gentlemen! What do I do with this? I... am gonna be thinking about you for a long time. Cheers to us, buddy. Both of us. An arsterpiece - uh, masterpiece.
