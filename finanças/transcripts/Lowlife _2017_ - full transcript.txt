This is El Monstruo. (GENTLE MUSIC) Kaylee. Kaylee. Dan, he... Oh, God. He needs the operation, like, real, real bad. It's so scary, his condition it's so serious. And I don't want to lose him it's just that time's run out. And if you're certain that she's a match and since there's no other option for us then, yeah. Do it. Take my daughter's kidney. Well, being the man of action that I am, I put it all in motion as soon as I received your frantic call. You know? Oh, don't throw that away just, just leave that right there. I'll rinse it out. I reuse them. Okay. Well, uh, as you can see from the medical record your daughter is a perfect match for your husband. Same blood type, HLA typing eye color, favorite jelly beans carpet, drapes. I'm kidding, heh. But, uh, you know, you couldn't ask for a better set-up, medically speaking. Why is Kaylee helping us with this? She hasn't even met us. You and Dan are still her birth parents. She's a good kid. It's, it's only because our backs are against the wall on this thing. [TED] Look, it's handled. Kaylee is on board so take a yes for a yes already. Alright. Let me just... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I mean, this'll be a fine start but how many ones are in there? Oh, you know what? We'll just call it a down payment. No. This is the amount we agreed on. I got every cent tied up in this business plus we've still got to pay for Daniel's transplant. Let's be clear, okay? This money is for Kaylee, not for me. It's for her future. So, are you trying to help your daughter? Or are you trying to screw her over? Again? No, no, of course not. You're right, you're right. Okay. Done deal! Now, find a bag for this cash and meet me out front, I gotta walk past all these shitbirds you let live here. Hey, Teddy, um, I need your word everything's gonna be okay. Jesus, Crystal, how many illegals you got here? I don't want to see Kaylee hurt, so. Maybe I should, uh, see her or something? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Kaylee was very clear about never never meeting you and Dan. It would be too hard on her. I guess that's understandable. On the bright side, you're still saving Dan's life, so. I mean, you are getting a kidney. Sweet deal! Dan. Dan? Dan! (COUGHS) God. Fuck! Honey, it's not what it looks like. Dan, what the hell are you doin'? Geez, come on. Why did you tape this shit? What the fuck, Dan? Playin' Edward 40-hands, looks like I lost. Where'd you even get the money for all this shit? [DAN] Change jars you've been hoarding. Are you? Dan, we need every single cent for your treatment. Come on, honey, it's not like you wouldn't sneak a drink or two if you were dyin' on me, right? Dan, you're not dyin'. I got you a kidney. I found a donor. (EXHALES) Daniel, you've got a new lease on life. What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I was as good as dead, where'd it come from? It doesn't matter where it came from. It's, it's a perfect match! No, no, no, no, no! Dan. Dan! Dan! I had just come to terms with this shit! Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. You are not giving up on me, Dan! You know what your problem is? I'll tell you. You can't give up on anything even when it's time. And that's why we live with all this shit. I mean, what? Who, who, who has an answering machine let alone in original packing? You cannot claim the warranty if you do not have the box. That's what I'm trying to tell you, sweetie. That's what I've been trying to say is my warranty expired a long time ago so let it go. I can't, Dan. (SIGHS) Oh, baby, baby, come here. Listen to me now. Listen, listen. Listen to me, okay? You know, the hardest thing for me, what's killing me? It's not this. It's knowing that you, that you'll be alone because of my weakness. (SNIFFLES) And then I made you give our baby daughter away. Oh, no, no, no, don't say that. That was, that was... That was for her own good, Dan. We were never gettin' sober. Well, you did! You did! B-but I... Shit. You tried. But, hey, there's more time now. You could beat this. (SIGHS) Baby, have you ever thought that, maybe this is just who I am? Maybe at the end of the day this is all I am? A fuck-up! Ohh, Dan. Listen, maybe, when you get better, we call Kaylee and maybe she'll want to meet us. Because, you know, she's older now. Yeah. Yeah. Wouldn't that be nice? Kaylee that would be, yeah. I think that's something I need. (SNIFFLES) We both need that. And I'm sorry. I love you. I love you, baby. I love you. And you found a kidney! (LAUGHING) You found a kidney! (SIGHS) You know what this calls for? A celebration. Ah. 'Cause this kidney is shot. Right? (GENTLE MUSIC) Dan. I gotta go out and run errands for a bit, honey. You watch the desk for me? Oh, my God! Fuck. (LINE RINGING) Pick up the phone, pick up the phone, pick up the phone. [TED] Yeah? She's fucking pregnant, asshole! Who's this? You know who this is! [TED] Lady, you got me confused with somebody else. Wrong number or something. Teddy, don't you pull this shit. She's fucking pregnant. Kaylee's pregnant. Call it off. Hey! For the record, I got no idea who you are or what you're talking about. Oh, my God! What the fuck! [TED] Okay, lady, I can see you're confused. And even if I acted as if I knew what you were talking about and believe me, I don't have the slightest fucking clue this pregnant chick probably considered the risks before she signed on. Well, I'm not signed on! Call it off! [TED] I gotta say, this seems like a very last-minute call. So? So. Last-minute calls yield last-minute results. What the hell does that mean? [TED] (sighs) If I had to take a guess it means that whatever you're talking about is probably already in motion. (KAYLEE YELLING) Leave me alone! No! (INTENSE MUSIC) (GRUNTING) Jesus! Fuck! Oh, my God. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (MACHINE BEEPING) (SOBBING) [DAN] Crystal, we've done enough damage to our baby girl. She won't suffer anymore on my account. It's time to let her go.
