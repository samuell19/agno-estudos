YOU'RE WEARING A WINDBREAKER, SIR. I WAS SPEAKING OF A DINNER JACKET OR AT LEAST A TIE AND A SPORTS COAT. COULDN'T YOU JUST PUT US IN THE BACK IN THE CORNER SOMEWHERE OUT OF THE WAY? IT'S MY LAST NIGHT STATESIDE, AND I WANTED TO TAKE MY GIRL OUT TO DINNER. I'M SORRY, SIR, BUT IT'S A RULE STRICTLY ENFORCED. WELL, THANK YOU. THAT MAN'S A PRICK! HE WAS DOING HIS JOB. BULLSHIT! JUST LIKE A SECOND LIEUTENANT-- YOU GIVE THEM A LITTLE POWER, AND THEY'LL ROLL IN IT LIKE DOGS IN SHIT. MAKES THEM FEEL LIKE WOLVES INSTEAD OF THE STUPID LITTLE FUCKING LAP DOG THAT HE IS. I'M GONNA BURN HIS ASS. EDDIE, WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A NICE, NORMAL DATE. OH, THERE'S NO PROBLEM, JUST A MAN WITH A MISSION. WHAT KIND OF MISSION? YOU AND ME AGAINST THE PRICKS. ARE YOU WITH ME? IT HAS JUST BEEN THE CRAZIEST NIGHT. EDDIE'S GRANDFATHER DIES, AND THE NEXT THING WE KNOW, WE'RE HEADED FOR MIDNIGHT MASS. PUT THAT BACK WHERE IT BELONGS. YES, MA'AM. AND HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE APPROPRIATE FUNERAL WEAR HANGING IN HIS CLOSET. I UNDERSTAND, BUT IT'S LATE. WE WERE ASLEEP. I KNOW AND I'M VERY SORRY. IT'S JUST, WE WOULD JUST LIKE ONE JACKET SO THAT EDDIE CAN LOOK HIS BEST. PLEASE, DARLING, HURRY. OK, DARLING. I'M HURRYING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. EDDIE'S HAVING TROUBLE MAKING DECISIONS. HE'S A LITTLE SHOOK UP. WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON? THEY'RE GOING TO A FUNERAL. I TELL YOU, ROSE, THAT WAS OUTSTANDING BULLSHIT. I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED. IT WASN'T EASY WITH YOU THROWING JACKETS ALL OVER. AHEM! GOOD EVENING. DINNER FOR TWO, PLEASE. THANKS. OH, LOOK. IT'S SO NICE, SO CLEAN. SHH! ROSE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ONE? HEY, FRIENDLY. OVER HERE. THIS WILL BE JUST FINE, THANKS. PLEASE. IT'S MY PLEASURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU'VE BEEN SO WONDERFUL. HERE. THIS IS FOR YOU--A BUCK. THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY, SIR. OH, PLEASE, I INSIST! YOU'RE WORTH A BUCK. NOW, ISN'T HE? SEE? YOUARE WORTH A BUCK. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND EFFORT, SIR. JUST WAIT TILL I'M THROUGH WITH HIM-- HE'S NOT GOING TO KNOW WHETHER TO SHIT OR GO BLIND. EDDIE, YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DO THIS? WHAT? LISTEN, ROSE. SOMEONE DUMPS ON ME 5 POUNDS, I DUMP BACK 50. ALL RIGHT? I'M NOT THROUGH WITH THAT JACK-OFF, YET. OK, EDDIE, IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF THE NIGHT TRYING TO MAKE THIS MAN MISERABLE, I'M GOING TO GO HOME. WHAT? YEAH, I'M SERIOUS. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WE CAME HERE TO HAVE A NICE DINNER. AND I'D LIKE SOME RESPECT FROM THAT MAN. THAT'S ALL. YOU DESERVE RESPECT, TOO. WE'RE PAYING JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS FUCKING JOINT. THAT'S HOW YOU GET RESPECT? PEOPLE ARE SUCH GODDAMN IDIOTS. I KNOW THEY ARE, BUT WHAT IS THE POINT IN SPENDING ALL YOUR TIME AND ENERGY TRYING TO GET EVEN WITH EVERYBODY THAT MAKES YOU ANGRY? BECAUSE IT FEELS GREAT, THAT'S WHY, IT FEELS FUCKING GREAT. ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S AN ASSHOLE-- AND WHAT'S THE POINT OF EVERY WORD THAT COMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH BE A CURSE WORD? HMM. WELL, ARE YOU READY TO ORDER NOW? NO. YES, GODDAMN IT. I'M GOING TO HAVE THE-- THE FUCKING POACHED SALMON WITH THE SON-OF-A- BITCHING RICE AND, UH...

THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE, A BEER? YEAH. YOU MUST BE STARVED. NAH, I'M NOT STARVED. HERE YOU ARE. THANK YOU. I'LL JUST PUT THIS OVER HERE FOR NOW. POACHED SALMON AND RICE PILAF. MMM. OH, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. ISN'T THIS BEAUTIFUL? YEAH. THAT LOOKS GOOD, REAL GOOD. SEE, YOU ARE HUNGRY. WHY DIDN'T YOU ORDER ANYTHING? I COULDN'T PAY FOR IT. I CAN PAY FOR THAT, AND I CAN PAY FOR THIS, BUT THAT'S ALL TILL PAYDAY. WHAT'S THAT FOR? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THANKS. I'M GOING TO HIT THE HEAD. OK. I'LL WAIT OUTSIDE. I KNOW THAT HE WAS SO RUDE TO YOU. A-HA! I KNOW, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO PREJUDGE PEOPLE ON HOW THEY LOOK OR HOW THEY'RE DRESSED. DON'T YOU THINK? MMM. THANK YOU. GOOD NIGHT. SO, WHAT ARE YOU GRINNING ABOUT? I WAS JUST WONDERING WHAT YOU'D LOOK LIKE WITH YOUR HAIR A LITTLE LONGER AND WITHOUT THAT-- THAT BRUISE ON YOUR FACE. WELL, NOT MUCH BETTER. THAT'S FOR SURE.

AS SOON AS I GOT THERE, I TRIED TO JOIN THE AIR FORCE, BUT THEIR RECRUITER WAS OUT TO LUNCH. SO THE MARINE RECRUITER SEES ME PACING AROUND THE POST OFFICE AND SAYS, "ELEANOR ROOSEVELT WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU." ELEANOR ROOSEVELT? YEAH. SO I SAY, "THAT'S QUITE A TRICK, SEEING AS SHE'S DEAD." THE RECRUITER SAYS, "WELL, SHE SAID IT BEFORE SHE DIED. "SHE CALLED YOU AN OVERSEXED, OVERTRAINED, UNDERFED, UNDERPAID KILLING MACHINE." I THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY. SO I ASKED HIM. I SAID, "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" AND HE SAYS, "SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT MARINES, AND YOU SURE AS HELL LOOK LIKE A MARINE TO ME." AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY NEAT, SO I BOLTED HOME, GOT THE OLD MAN, BROUGHT HIM BACK, AND HE SIGNED THOSE PAPERS SO DAMN FAST HE NEARLY SPRAINED HIS WRIST. WHOO.

WE'LL JUST BE THERE AS ADVISERS TO TEACH THEM HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THE COMMIES. THAT COULD BE DANGEROUS. NAH. KICK A LITTLE ASS, TAKE A FEW NAMES. BE BACK IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS. EDDIE, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME BEFORE THAT YOU WERE LEAVING? I THOUGHT IT WOULD SOUND LIKE BULLSHIT. YOU KNOW, SOMETHING JUST TO SAY TO-- TO GET INTO YOUR... SKIVVIES. WOULD YOU MIND IF I WROTE YOU? ME? HELL, NO. THAT WOULD BE GREAT. DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THIS CLUB IN NORTH BEACH CALLED THE STILL LIFE CAFE? I WANT TO SING THERE ONE DAY AND WHEN I WRITE ABOUT IT, YOU'LL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YEAH. SURE. WE DON'T HAVE TO.

PETER, PAUL, AND MARY ARE NOT REAL FOLK SINGERS. NO? NO. REAL FOLK SINGERS WRITE THEIR OWN STUFF, SAY WHAT'S ON THEIR MINDS. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO CAN MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. HOW'S THAT? THEIR MUSIC CAN CHANGE THE WORLD. WELL, IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD, ROSE, WHY DON'T YOU JOIN THE MARINES AND START SHOOTING? SHOOTING CHANGES THINGS REAL QUICK. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU JUST SAID THAT. WELL, I JUST DID. THAT'S RIDICULOUS. SHOOTING DOESN'T SOLVE ANYTHING. YOU SHOOT AT PEOPLE, WELL, YOU GOT PEOPLE SHOOTING BACK AT YOU. WHEN YOU SING TO PEOPLE, YOUR MESSAGE GOES STRAIGHT TO THE SOUL. YOU OPEN UP A WHOLE NEW POINT OF VIEW. YOU DISARM THEM. WELL, ALL I KNOW IS THAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S SENDING TROOPS ACROSS THE BIG WATERS TO MAKE SOME CHANGES AND HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T ISSUE THEM NO GUITARS. WELL, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO USE MUSIC OVER AGGRESSION. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THE SONGWE SHALL OVERCOME? WHAT'S SO FUNNY? WHAT--WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING? I'M NOT LAUGHING. YES, YOU ARE.

HE DIDN'T FIND MARCIE. HE HIRED HER. HE EVEN TOLD HER NOT TO WEAR HER TEETH. OH, COME ON. HE DID. I OVERHEARD THEM FIGHTING ABOUT IT. HE WAS TRYING TO CHISEL HER OUT OF HER SHARE, SO HE'S NOT ONLY A CHEAT AND A MORON, HE'S A CHEAPSKATE. THAT SON OF A BITCH. OH... HEY! HOLD IT. HOLD IT. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
