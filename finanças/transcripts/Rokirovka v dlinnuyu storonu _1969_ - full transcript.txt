Yurasova Put your glasses on You have arrived You don't recognise me? My surname is Brooks I don't care Put me in touch with the Embassy Do not start with the banale You are an intelligent man Put me in touch with the Embassy! Read Here Lower In light of above, I ask for political asylum Do you recognise the signature? Not mine You are too categorical Tests can be performed These injections What was injected? Calm down There will be no more injections You had alcohol poisoning Try to remember Yesterday night in Meinz in the restaraunt During the celebration Do you remember? Oh yes, you really are unwell You need a rest Well, how was it? He is overly excitable That is what appeals to me With whom was he on probation in West Germany? With Professor Mullmann From the Heidenberg university. He is of very high opinion about Lebedev His intellect is ten or eleven on a twelve-bar scale It does not concern you that he is a biologist No, it does not concern me Not even a tiny bit On the contrary - he will be useful to us as he knows the necessary material Have you really stopped the injection? Yes. I want him to decide with a clear mind Otherwise he may surprise us later He can surprise us now - there are two days untill the end and his dissappearance may be noticed During two days I will find a key to him But... in case of most extreme scenario We have psychiatric hospitals No injections Calm down The injections are abolished But you will have to take this It is a sleeping pill Everything is all right Try to fall asleep Let's go Where were you? Just conversation with a chance aquintance Well then Today you look at lot better Maybe there is something you'd like to ask of me Please, do not be shy My tie Naturally, it will be returned to you Actually... It does not match As you like Let us not play hide-and-seek, as they say in Russia We are interested in you We hope to generate interest in response You hope to create a revolution in biology with my help? I am glad you have not lost a sense of humour So, about your business You have not become involved by accident If one looks at you carefully It is not hard to guess that you have somehow lost yourself in life Interesting I was born in Leningrad During the blockade, in winter I was very weak and barely survived Only started walking two-and-a-half years old Then they noticed one of my legs was shorter than the other Blockade rations and all that When I was nine I had an operation but never could completely stop limping Just a little imperfection, and because of it... You retreated into yourself Discovered a painfully high self-esteem You immersed yourself fully in books, in Science But it is unlikely that you were valued as high as you deserved to be But your probation period in West Germany went splendidly By the way, you met Sonya Sterz there Do you remember how you were tortured by doubts? Who Fraulein Sof'ya would prefer: yourself or Victor? I am forced to listen to whatever rubbish comes into your head But one thing I insist on Do not pry into my private life Ok? Who has a private life nowadays? A private life! I want to help you find yourself We want action - unstoppable protest against the goverment That is the main aim of the Union of German Socialist Students Initally we need to limit the universities link with industry This is how we can prevent the serial production of idiots I would genuinely like to wish you success But what will you achieve? When you become parents, your children will also rebel Rebel against you! You radical view is simply a manifestation of biological aggression It will burn out with age How old are you? You are our guest and we are forced to speak politely You are wrong to be shy, I say what I think Young people must find a way to cooperate with society The question is - with which society We have started to look carefully at our society and we are convinced it is rotten It emits a stink You ought to cut your hair more often or use deodorant You want to cleanse society? Look carefully at yourselves Who have you chosen as your teachers? The argentinian Che Guevara The frenchman Juilles De Braille The black man Fanon Some of you the chinese man, Mao Do you present a united power? Which is capable of making society better Yes, we have different leaders, but we care about the same problems The place of the King and Kennedy brothers makes us no less furious than the appeance in our country of followers of Adolf Hitler One of whom shot our Comrade Rody Duchki We have the same mottos and a wide set of political right The participation in university management Stopping the war in Vietnam Nothing has united American and British students as much as protesting against the Vietnam war Only russian students have remained indifferent to it You became a student during the Korean war and studied in three colleges since It is time for you to speak on behalf of an older generation I do not think you are as naive as you try to pretend you are It is the help our country provides Vietnam, including weapons Which holds the invasion within certain boundaries But you did not answer the question Is that the official viewpoint? I would like to know your personal opinion Thirty years ago russian men went to fight in Spain Like young americans, french, germans Are you satisfied by my reply? Thank you I would like to ask your friend a question What does he think about Marks' doctrine of the death of &quot;State&quot; during socialism? Is it correct? Yes, historical circumstances will lead to a replacement of State with communal goverment But only during Communism Is that your personal opinion? If an atomic war does not get in our way Bravo, you spoke wonderfully! Although what you believe is, of course, unachievable And what do you believe in? My Dear, illusions are very dangerous It is them which will one day lead to an explosion Practicality, on the contrary, allows to calm the beast At every step we demonstrate our devotion to society Our readiness to serve it Where as in reality we are serving all of humankind You do not agree? Your friend is a great dancer, the girl too Yes, I liked you back then Your entire being was keen on achieving one goal To conquer Sonya It was then, as should have been expected You said something you should not have What exactly? Are you familiar with this Magazine? Aren't you? The replacement of state with community ruling - that what young Soviet scientists deman That can be achieved if the goverment does not start an atomic war They claimed Falsification The wording is somewhat licensious, but when this article is put together with your dissappearance from Germany And appearance here Just one question Please Tell me. That day, in the castle of Hornberg Were you not ashamed to pretend to be a scholar No, I really am a scholar Not a biologist like you, a physisist Interesting, which domain of Physics do your current activities fit? My young colleague The last days of war Hitler already had rockets that could start from submarines He was going to use them to attack New York and your Leningrad Due to the spy activity, Hitlers secrets remained no longer his alone Maybe that is why you are alive Hitler's secrets Hitlers secrets became yours when our troops entered Berlin Very well Let us no longer speak of the dead man Hitler Let us instead speak of your compatriot, Professor Konchinsky Sir Lebedev, Sir Chernov - Doctor Mullman awaits you in the library I can give you good news - your paper has been published in America Look, I have kept my promise You will receive payment in a month In your place I would wait untill you return to Leningrad before publication Are you serious? In any case, you would be published abroad sooner or later You know, times have changed In the past, biologists used to be quartered for respecting the West Now the West bows to us for what we are doing here I did not know you had such opinions Here are the two young slackers I told you about Professor Konchinsky would like to meet you Our famous compatriot Greetings, Sirs I have read your article Very interesting My colleague Chernov is also writing a very interesting piece of work Yes, especially his methodology Pleasant to hear it I carefully follow works of young russian biologists Even though we belong to different generations By the way, Gentlemen, I have come to make you an offer Would you like to work in my laboratory for a year or two I think my colleague here will not be jealous I have secrets to share Business-related and otherwise Personally, I'd love to accept your offer but... I hope you understand it does not just depend on my wishes I understand I want just one thing: for everything to be open between us I left Russia as a student With my parents Except one occasion, for which I paid dearly I never got involved in politics I corresponded with Vavilov and Shemerkaudze But now these names are respected in Russia, as far as I know I do not know what is thought of me in my Homeland But I always felt for my Homeland... In short, Gentlemen My soul is pure In front of you If I tempt you to join me for a year Do you think you aquiantance with Konchinsky will do you any favours there?' Not at all His speech about emigrants is published The year 1921 There are newer ones Two young russian scientist are invited to work in West Germany So what? How can this emigrant newspaper have known about a private conversation? It is on the tape of your tape-recorder Quite possibly But you have not replied to my question It seems that Konchinsky is collaborating with the emigrants Oh yes It will look just like that You are wrong to view it so lightly By the way, would you like to know what your friend Chernov thinks of Konchinskys invitation? A fantastic offer guarantees a great career The old man is so famous that after working with him you will be taken to any laboratory Even in the States That is impossible By the way, I don't know about Boris, but I... Do you mean that girl, Sonya? For her... Again you misunderstand me Turns out he is smarter than you, and you are left with nothing again What are you on about? Who do you want to deceive? You think I don't know what happened between you There is something appealing in being able to read other's thoughts, isn't there? Yes If you forget for a minute it is dishonourable Yes, dishonourable But do not forget what sort of world we live in Lies all around Spies Betrayal Better to read thoughts of others than to allow them to read yours You will find that out soon Today you met with Professor Konchinsky A lovely, though somewhat naive old man offers you to work for him for a year If it is worth fighting for this, then only for S. By this mysterious &quot;S.&quot; I assume Sonya Sterz is meant Now you recognise your own handwriting Remember what you wrote on the 14th of february? I never thought I could be so happy This takes me higher than what I could imagine It is not hard to understand For know reasons, you were not spoilt by female attention And then, on the 14th february... You are easily influenced But are direct enough You life will be long Very The line of fate The line of fate... Is about 30 years long Another line appears Which is next to the first line and strengthens it What a pleasant surprise! Happy to see you, Sonya But it seems you do not feel the same. Have I guessed right? You guessed right Boris Your girlfriend has lovely manners She cannot spit in a man's face I wanted a chess game Will have to do it next time Bye! Do you have any wine? No, Sonya I have some in the car Will you go get it? My dad died in 1944 That is why I do not remember him at all When he died, things were hard for Mother and I One time, we did not eat for several days So I went to the refuse-tip Wanted to find something But it was too late So, and suddently A woman with a bucket Gave me two herring-heads I grabbed them, ran But then saw a girl standing in an entrance A girl just like me maybe a little older She was looking at me I stretched the fish heads out to her She grabbed them and shouted to me: Get lost! I couldn't step away, I just stood there and looked at her Then she lifted her arm and... Why am I telling you all this? It's my Grandmothers I will stay at yours tonight They told me you are not eating That is a mistake - you need your strength Another piece of advice Never reveal your feelings I have already started to reform Great So let us talk about Sonya Sterz Do you not think there is something strange in the way she treats you? I do not think that You are tired? Mummy sent a letter Is inviting us to Meinz for three days You thought of this trip yourself Myself? Mummy will be pleased How will you introduce me? My mum does not ask questions May I ask you a stupid question? Borya... We are together What else can there be? We will be together for another month or two Do you think about that? Borya Can you stay here for a year at least? No I cannot go with you My mother is here My Father My Father lived here, everything is here for me, you see? You will leave, I will stay Both you and I must continue living Or do you think we will jump under a train together? No Borya Let us not make things difficult, I ask you You do it cunningly You could do it too I lack the imagination Nonsense It is very simple We have the equipment to record sound at a distance of 50-70 metres Even if you whisper But with the permission of your friend, the microphone could have been on her person Bravo First Chernov, Konchinsky Now Sonya There is no love, friendship Denying it is no less banale than believing it My goal is different Life is such that you are unlikely to be believed But rather our version will be trusted Any tale about Sonya will be trusted And when you believe this you will have to collaborate with us You are wasting your time We have almost reached our goal It remains to remind you of your trip to Meinz To the celebration of &quot;Fashing&quot; Lebedev That is for the sleeves This medal is given for the best dance This is a princess crown Greeting at the Fashing and then kissing You probably will not understand me But I was always against Slavistics Sonya is obstinate Just like her dad She wanted to read Dostoevsky in the original Mummy has started on her favourite topic Really, I am not sure why you are so against Slavic studies English, Italian, Japanese give well-paid jobs Where as Slavic studies What? What is up with you I do not want to work In any large company Life is harsher than you would like it to be Boris, are there similar celebrations in Russia? Maslenitsia Before they would ride on Troika horse-carriages with bells Burned straw dolls symbolising winter Made pancakes Boris, I want to ask What is wrong with your leg? With my leg I was born during the Leningrad Blockade In winter You are unfair towards him Our feelings for each other are serious Maybe he is a great person, but he is from Russia Everything repeats itself, Sonya Everything Your Father was german How much he had to go through because I am Chekh Maybe he will stay in Germany another year He has been invited to work In a large laboratory He promised Did you really promise her? No How can you prove that How can you explain what happened in the restaraunt yesterday Sonya was a little drunk And that is it? No-one will believe that Do you want to spoil the celebration for me? Just today I ask you not to create problems Do not drink, Sonya Leave me alone! I am a grown-up I know for myself what I should and should not do You do not want to give anything up for me Who have we here? Where did you come from? Just like you I have come to celebrate Where they drink the most Sonechka, you will allow me? What to do with you, fool, you may sit here Let us drink Let us I am bored otherwise here With pleasure, my dear fools Who is that man? Offering heroin Listen, maybe you should try some? A real man should experience everything, right, Sonya? What are you laughing at? Based on your hair... You are an idiot Sonya! Brudershaft How I understand you But it is worth staying for this girl What do you mean? Do not pretend to be a fool I know everything So Twelve hours later, you were here Now you can assess the situation for yourself You were constantly connected to Henry Arland He is well known as a drug-dealer by international police It is likely that you discussed your Homeland unfavourably with him The emigrant Konchinsky offered you to stay in Germany Sonya Sterz also encouraged you to do that In the Meinz restarant during celebrations You started drunk debauchery You ended up at the police-station, afraid of the consequences of your actions Naturally, you came to us asking for political asylum That is how it will all appear I want to help you find yourself To become stronger More confident To control your life Instead of being a robot amongst thousands No everyone is capable of it, but you could Now With my help If you refuse - your life and scientific career will perish anyway Suspicious looks behind your back You will remain a loser In addition You love her very much Don't you? You would not want to ruin her fate too I must tell you that the West Germany intelligence has investigated you thoroughly Even using infra-red to film at night I myself dissapprove of such methods I would do anything to destroy these tapes You understand To do that, it is necessary... I want to see these tapes Best not I will stay at yours tonight Stop! I agree Glad to hear it. I am sure you will never regret it Although I understand how hard it was for you Enough! Your conditions? Look outside A magnificent sight, isn't it? Here, in the ocean, lies the salvation of human kind From hunger for minerals and thirst In the next hundred years the continents will feel a lack of coal Oil Iron, and even fresh water Of course, this is not the only explanation of increased interest in the Ocean There is another reason Atomic submaries have become a strong military force The ability to exist underwater for a lengthy period of time Ease of movement Makes them a fine strategic weapon The Arctic is a unique region of military submarine activity Surfacing through the ice, the atomic submarine reaches the North Pole Electronic technology allows precise target aim A rocket fired from underwated can reach almost any point on the Northern hemisphere This is all very interesting But I am not sure how it relates to me You need to change your field of work slightly What do you mean? You will work on the sea Marine microbiology, to be precise Do you think that is so simple? No, you will receive scientific materials from us Present them in Leningrad as your own That will help you intergrate into the University which interests us What will I need to do in this University? Do not hurry Initially you need to stabilise your position in the new place To earn our full trust At present I am forced to be very cautious with you - that is my job Tell me, do you regret leaving you previous profession, physics? Do you think I do not realise what I am doing? Both my side and yours are accumulating a great military potential Only the equal balance of forces prevents the world from catastrophe When one country overtakes another in military technology level Only you as a technology intelligence worker are able to unconspicously restore harmony Is that not a great goal? I do not share your happiness Spying is dirty work I am forced to work for you But for me science and espionage will never be compatible You will say that science today works for the military That is a well-used phrase Not Einstein, others made an atomic bomb of his theory Yes, I used to reason just as you did But time freed me of illusions I prefer to live with illusions Heya, how was the celebration in Meinz Never better I bet you didn't waste time Hello? Borya, what happened? It was all ok Do you hear me? I think we are both being watched It is better for us not to meet Boris, darling, what happened? Why are you silent Borya! Studying oceanography? I did not know you scientific interests are so wide We have not seen each other for a long time and I have missed you terribly Maybe let us play? Just one little game I am sorry, I must run Wait, we will have to play our farewell game That is what Doctor Brooks asked You won't need to think Everything has been thought of for us Taking a pawn means your materials are acquired Castling the long way means a personal meeting is needed Not bad, huh? Yes Very well thought of Gentlemen, our year of working together is over I see our separation with sadness and with joy Gentlemen Let us drink for biology For our science which I consider sacred It is my conviction that there is no science more human than biology You are leaving? Yes, Sonya, tomorrow I know something happened with you Am I to blame somehow? I was suffering thinking of that all the time we were apart No, Sonya, it is not your fault Then what? You do not know We could not have met It would have turned against you and I must know all is well with you That nothing threatens you Now I must leave Right now that is the only way out I cannot live without you, Boris Maybe everything will be well Excuse me please Mr Lebedev, if I am not mistaken? Yes Pleased to meet you, I am Dr Karson All right, Boris, speak later Please I have a small gift from Dr Mullman for you We met at the congress in the Hague I can bring the gift to you tomorrow After eight pm I will try to return by the end of the perfomance Excuse me Please come in Thank you Maybe you would like tea or coffee? Now I am keeping house alone, Mother is in the country Thank you, I will not stay long You know every minute is valuable for a tourist I was asked to pass this gift to you Thank you for the book That is too much, really It is strange that Dr Mullman sent me a book on oceanography Mullman? That is the first time I hear this name Did you not mention it yesterday? No, I spoke of Dr Brooks There is some misunderstanding You have confused me with someone, I know of no Dr Brooks Brooks asked me to tell you, Alex Your trial period is over, time for serious work Hide this packed at yours for now It will need to be passed on to one of our Soviet friends Who cannot meet foreigners himself We will inform you where and when you should pass it on Money is hidden in the books cover, and page 341 contains a coded message With future tasks Boris Petrovich? You must be in the Hermtage at two-thirty Yes, Roden's building No, you will be approached A stunning sculpture Come down to the smoking room The task is being cancelled Where is the package? Excuse me, you dropped something Be calmer Calmer Your prevoius materials received a high mark and helped us in some ways Have you familiarised yourself with the new instructions? I am leaving on an expedition to the Barentsev sea In a month Very well, I will let Dr Brooks know He will find a way to give you detailed instructions When, where? Do not worry, we will find a way Prepare Hi, Boris Here is the probe The meeting place with Dr Brook.... Degrees latitude Degrees longtitude Machine to a hundred I will go check the buoy You brought the walkie-talkie? Lower the boat from the left You have changed The sea has done you good, colleague Glad to see you Me also I hope your boat is far enough, the locators from &quot;Persei&quot; could see it Yes, I know. They will return for me in two hours We need to discuss things thoroughly Sound, that is the problem Radiowaves we use to communicate cannot pass through water We can only locate our enemy using sound But for that we need to know all that affects sound quality and speed Temperature and salt concentration of water Warm and cold currents, the sea-bed surface Even microorganism presence. Gradually, will our help you will find know your way around these issues Here is your task It addition to what we discussed before This is much more serious compared to your previous tasks The new real work begins They are already coming for me The circumstances must have changed Well then, time to say good-bye I wish you success, colleague See you, Mr Brooks Seal openings, immediate submergence Take a seat, please You understand fully what happened to you and need no consolations, do you? Your name is well-known to me since 1945 Then you worked with Miss Yasus And worked with Hitler's atomic bomb secrets I was simply an army special-service agent Then later, I would come across your name in the context of rocket business And now we meet in the ocean Yes, Sir Brooks, you and I are far from young men Yes You recognise the signature It is not mine You are a soviet secret service agent? No I have just one question As well as his scientific activities Did Lebedev do anything else? No Boris is only a scientist Yes, only Shortly before Fashing, we discovered a provocation against Lebedev is being prepared A few days in advance we were able to warn Boris of the danger We decided there was no need to interrupt his scholarly sabbatical Just one thing we could not have predicted That you will sink to a violent abduction And use force When Dr Karson appeared in Leningrad It became clear you have long-reaching aims We had no choice but to respond That is the only role Boris had By the way, we have a high opinion of you Thank you I didn't write to you for a long time I needed time to understand how hard it is without you I want to see you I will come to you I do not know when it will become possible, it needs strength to achieve It is Christmas here now When I was coming back from Meinz University, the fairground roundabouts were spinning But the streets were empty and everything for me stopped I am glad you decided to come I understand that is difficult Maybe like no-one else, I know what a difficult world we live in But I know that from this unbelievable difficulty we need to obtain the simplest and kindest truths I have a lot of work now This will help me to wait The End
