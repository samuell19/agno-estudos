Like a fee? Mm-mmm, wasn't no fee involved, was there? No, We here because we want to be, Which is all the more reason why you should have these, $50,000? Holy shit! I mean shoot, Uh-uh, Mr, b, Ain't no way we could take this, We're here because we want to be, You know, until this very second, the only person I ever totally trusted in my entire life was Lily, Ha ha ha ha ha, I feel like dancing, [Music plays] Go, go!

Don't act like you don't know, Mickey, The guilt, the guilt of what we doing, Now, that old man down there is a nice old man, And he ain't got nothing around him but people trying to use him, like you and me, I know-- why do you think I got up and left, We should've been done got up and left, D, don't you think that we could at least say good-bye? We can't, Why? 'Cause if I go to him and I say we leaving, he going to say, "why?" And I'm going to have to tell him that you and me been a part of this whole big lie, I can't do it, So we're going to write him a letter, and we're going to tell him the truth,,, Everything, Everything?
