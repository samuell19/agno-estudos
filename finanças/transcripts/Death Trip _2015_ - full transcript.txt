Dawei. You startled me again! Is it fun? Cheeky girl. Don't work so hard. The world isn't going to end... ...if you don't work hard I've told you! Don't call me that. My colleagues start calling me that too. It seems fine to me. Instead of your full name, Cheeky girl sounds more friendly. Stop it! I've a very important meeting to attend tomorrow. Isn't every meeting of yours important? Look at you. You work day and night. Your work is far more important than anything else. Including me. Not again! Please don't get jealous with my priority in works. But today is a very special situation. They're going to choose... ...the head for the New York branch. Everyone is fighting so hard to get this job. So you're going to New York for sure? I wish I could make the decision. How about me? What's wrong? Isn't it tasty? It's your favourite beef congee. Why is it so smelly? Smelly? Nothing is wrong with it. I bet you're too tired. If you go on like this, you'll wear yourself out. I'd like to take a break too. Really? I feel that you are enjoying it. We live in the same city. But I feel as if we lived in different time zones. If you really end up going New York, can we still continue with our relationship? Dawei... I'm sorry. I know what you mean. But I really don't have time for this right now. We'll talk about it later. Okay? Fine. But don't you forget about tonight. I've made a reservation at that restaurant a month ago. You've said it so many times. It's been ringing in my ears! Don't do the same thing again. You failed to show up for my parents. I swear I won't. I think I owe you for the rest of my life! I'm back. Daddy. Miyeon. It's you. Where's Yuyeon? She's dead. Surprise! I'm sorry, everyone. Xiaoqi is still in the meeting. She'll join us later. Let's sit down first. Come on. Dawei. Are you being dumped? What are you talking about? It'd be great if it's true. You! Stop dreaming. His heart belongs only to Xiaoqi. He's the most faithful man in the world. An extinct species like dinosaurs. Well, that's hard to say. Stop teasing him. He's going to propose today. -Right? -Yes. Though Xiaoqi has been occupied with work recently. Dawei is definitely the most important man in her life. -Right? -Yes. Well, if it's true? Why would she want to work abroad? Am I right? Miss Tao Xiaoqi, I can't believe it! If I didn't come back for the keys, I'd never know how hard you work for getting the New York job. What time is it? It's almost midnight. No! Hey, where are you going? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know I've promised you. You know very well it's special case this time. Today is indeed a very special situation. As a couple, we should make decisions together. It's over there. Hi, how you doing? Hi. This is your key, enjoy your journey. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. What's wrong? That girl... She seems so weird. Let's go. Do you know I'd come? Of course. You weren't worried at all? Of course not. Really? Well, a little bit. How could you leave your work aside? What about the job in New York? Forget it. We're in Malaysia! Do you still remember where we first met? Don't be so annoying! I knew my mistake and I've changed. Did you? I'm not so sure. You'll know soon. The weather here is still so unpredictable. But on a side note, we would have not met each other then. It all started with a storm. Looking back at it, maybe it symbolized... ...the beginning of a stormy relationship. Nonsense! You make it sound so miserable! I have a surprise for you. What a coincidence! I have a surprise for you too. Why do you look so serious? What surprise? It's a secret. - You're so mean! - Yes, I am! You're annoying! Dawei. What's wrong? I saw something just now. Something very big. It looks like a car. Where is it? We just drove past it. It's in the bushes. How can you see it in such darkness? It's even in the bushes? You sure you saw it? I saw it... It does look like a car. Watch out! What's that? Did we hit someone? Did we? I don't know. I don't think so. I'll go down and take a look. No! It's too dangerous. It's so dark out there. It's fine. Don't worry. Hello. Are you Chinese? You are not local,are you? Where are you from? Hi, my name is David. This is Amy, my girlfriend. I'm Miyeon. Kim Miyeon. So you're Korean? You have a very large backpack. Are you an athlete? No. Why? Well, nothing. Just that your backpack reminds me that... ...Amy is an athlete too. She is a good swimmer. What's wrong? I'm very proud of you. So, Miyeon... You come here to visit or what? Are you alone? Yes. Where are you going? Sorry. We can only take you to the next town. Xiaoqi. It's not nice of you to say so. What's wrong with it? She's a stranger. You're not taking her with us, are you? At least, you should ask her where she's going. Maybe it's on the way. Don't be angry. We finally manage to have a holiday together. We don't know when we can do it again. What do you mean? You'll be in New York, I'll stay in Beijing. Aren't you coming with me? Are you willing to take me with you? You're a big boy now. You can come by yourself! Well, I still need to be looked after! I don't like her. She's so weird. Hey, she's sitting right behind us. She doesn't understand it anyway. What happened to the radio? I don't know. Maybe it got struck by the lightning. Turn it off. I want your man. He is mine. Dawei. What's wrong? I want her to get off as soon as possible. Why? I just want her to get off! What's wrong with you? Usually you're not mean to people. Something must be wrong with her. What happened to the man who picked her up at the airport? How about the car in the bushes? You think too much. You've watched too much Sherlock Holmes recently. Don't worry. Where is the toilet? Outside. There. I need to go too. Okay. Hey! The girl! Very cute! Is she your friend? No. We just met on our way. Miyeon. Did you just say that... ...you want my boyfriend? What did you mean? You think you've got everything now, huh? What? Happiness is all bullshit. What? What's wrong with you? Two sisters were treated as sex slaves by their stepfather. Many years later, they finally ran away. But... The eldest sister was betrayed by her younger sister and husband... ...while she was pregnant. Will she be happy again or not? What are you telling me? A story? Will she be happy again or not? I don't know. Maybe someday she will. What's your point? No surprise. Let's go. Where is Miyeon? I don't know. She wasn't there when I came out. Maybe she has left. Her baggage is still left in our car. Let's wait for a little while. I'll go without you then. What's wrong with you? You're not being yourself. You've been so mean. What's wrong with me? You should ask what's wrong with you! Why are you being so nice to a stranger? Men are all the same. What are you mad about? A girl was abandoned on the road late at night. How can we leave her alone like this? Would a decent girl show up alone on the road in the middle of nowhere? Okay then. I really don't want to upset you. I'll leave her baggage here then. No problem! I'll look after her for you. I'll go down and take a look. What's the problem? I've no idea. Maybe it's the engine. Get in the car. It is cold at night, don't catch a cold. Don't worry. What's wrong with it? This is weird. I don't know. Everything seems fine. It shouldn't be the engine problem. You get in the car first. I'll check again. Did you find the problem? I'm not sure. Sorry that we left. We thought you might have other plans. That's fine. People left me all the time. She has such a big bag with her. I wonder what's in it. I hope it's not machine guns or some heavy artillery. Don't scare me like that! What happened? Landslide ahead. No passing now. So how long will it take? We don't know. What should we do? We can only find a place to spend the night, and leave tomorrow. We can fill out stomach with some food too. Don't worry. Welcome. Welcome. How many rooms do you need? Two, please. They share one... ...and you stay alone. Am I right? No. We share a room. She stays alone. Two rooms. Please fill in the form. Okay. I'm starving. Is there anything to eat? The restaurant is just over there. It opens 24 hours. The food is nice. Don't you think she looks different now? No. You're paying too much attention to her. So that's what's all about. Tell me a little about your plan, please. I can't tell you now. Please look forward to it. Where are you going? I'll go check on her. Wait for me here. Where are you? What? What happened? The man was about to assault her. Luckily I stopped him just in time. I could never expect that. You stopped him really just in time, didn't you? Alright. I'll leave the rest to you. I am sorry to make trouble for you. I just didn't want to be left alone. But I always meet bad guys. You will be happy again. Thank you. David is a good man. I am happy for you. I hope he will come to New York with you. What did he say to you? He said he doesn't want to got to New York. Why are you still going online at this hour? Dawei is sleeping. He's sleeping? How could he do that? Maybe he's more interested in the girl that we picked up half way. What did you say? Nothing. Don't be so nosy. Have you heard about the New York job? Yes. I'm checking my emails now. How? Did you get it? That's the biggest thing in your life recently. You are really nosy. How are you? Why are you staying up so late? Tao Xiaoqi, You work so hard for the New York position. Can't I also make some contribution to the society? Hey, are you still there? Stop being so nosy. Work hard! I'm going to bed. These days I get tired or nausea easily. No way! You... Curiosity killed the cat! =1 Dear Mr. Robinson, with my deepest apologies =2 but I have decided not to take the GM post of the New York Branch. There are more than 20 wounds on the body. Fatal stabs in the head, neck and heart. The genitals were cut off by a sharp object. As for what kind of object was used... We need to investigate further. The time of death was between 11 at night to 1 in the morning. - Okay. Thanks. - Okay. What did you find? The money in the cash register is gone. But nothing is taken from the shelves. Do they have any surveillance camera installed? No. There is a mirror in the corner. You can see all the shelves from there. When you stay long enough in this field, you're bound to see all kinds of cases. Is this the same killer who struck in the house near the highway? The possibility is high. The methods are similar. By the look from the wounds, one can tell the murder weapon is no ordinary knife. This also corresponds to the other case. The victim looked terrified. He might have seen something unexpected just before he died. As if he had seen Hell. The killer was very cruel, but he didn't leave any evidence. None of the blow was fatal, but the victim was powerless to fight back. You can tell that he really enjoyed it. Or "they" I might say. Sorry. My shower doesn't work. Could you help me? Please. Okay. Xiaoqi. Don't be like this I'm sorry. Don't be angry. I didn't do anything. She said the shower didn't work. So I came to help her. You were still in bed. Listen to me! He came to me. I tried to convince him to go to New York. But he said he likes me. As you are not always there for him. You're insane! What are you talking about? What the hell are you talking about? Dawei! How dare you! You flirt with other women when I'm not around. How can you believe her but not me? Tell me then! How would she know if you didn't tell her all of these? Fine! You choose to believe this crazy woman, but not me. Don't you know me well enough? Now, I'm not sure I know you. What do you want? What the hell are you talking about? He's scary. Let's go out. Dawei! How dare you shout like this? Look at what you did and yet you are shouting at me? I did nothing! Let's take a walk. Maybe it is a misunderstanding. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Is it nice? It's tasty. May I? Please. You're checking out today? Check out? What do you mean? The girls who came with you last night. Both of them have left. So, do you want to check out today? They left? Yeah. They drove away. Drove? My car? Which direction were they heading towards? I've no idea. Maybe towards the east. Handsome, were you being dumped? Do you need someone to keep you company? Can I rent a car here? Sure. As long as you register with us. Breaking news. A murder took place at the gas station in Pantai Rhu Sepuluh. The cashier in the shop was murdered. Police predicted that... The time of death was between 11 at night to 1 in the morning. The police are investigating the case. It's a murder case. It happened on our road! Tao Xiaoqi, calm down. Don't get angry. Think about your baby. What am I doing? How could I come with her just like this? But Dawei... With what happened before... That's men. No. It's a misunderstanding, right? Maybe. So? I want to go back. It doesn't make sense that I just leave like that. Relax. He will find you if he wants. You don't trust man, do you? You are the elder sister, aren't you? Yuyeon! A cashier working on midnight shift yesterday... ...at a gas station in Jalan Pantai Penarik Terrenganu... ...was killed and the cash in the register has gone missing. The police believe that this is a homicide. That's the gas station we stopped by. It could have happened to us! I still want to talk to him. I want to go back. There's no way back. Hello, where are you? On some highway. I've no idea. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be so impulsive. Let's not talk about this. Where are you? I'll come for you. I heard on the radio that a murder took place in the shop. Soon after we left the gas station. I'm afraid. Calm down, which direction are you heading towards? I guess we're heading east. I'm not sure, she really freaks me out. I don't know what she's thinking. We're in Ladang Lembah Bidong... What are you doing? Haven't you said enough? Hello? Hello? Where are you? You are a crazy woman! You killed the man in the shop? Do you really think you're living a happy life? Let's play a game. Help me! Help me! She wants to kidnap me. What? Aren't the both of you lovers? No! She even killed the man in the shop. Please, help me. -Help me! -What are you talking about? Things between women are too complicated for me. Let's start the game. Hello, this is 999. Police! Someone is killed here. I'm looking for my girlfriend. She is missing. Hello, Sir. Please speak slowly. Watch out! Hello? Hello, Sir? Are you still there? Run! Quick! Run in a zigzag! Quick! I can't start the engine. She's here! Hurry! Hurry! Start the engine, quick! Let's go. She's here. Start the engine, quick! Quick! She's here. I can't start the engine. Go! Come on, hurry up! I still can't start the engine. What's wrong? Hurry up! She is insane. She must be insane! How can she look so happy when she kills? Calm down. Xiaoqi, please calm down. We'll be fine. I'm here. We'll be fine. Sweetheart. Don't be afraid. It's all over. Really? That Miyeon... She's a mad woman. I saw it with my eyes that she killed people. Come on. It's all over. You saw her got into an accident, right? You won't see her again. Do you think... ...she's dead? I don't know how badly the car crashed. What's wrong? You can't be worried about her! I'm scared. I'm scared of seeing her again. That's impossible. In a situation like this, she'll be sent to the hospital straight away. You should take a rest. We'll go back later. Back? Where are we going back to? Back to where the car crashed. The police will come when there is a car crash. We need to pick up our baggage from the hotel. No! If she survives and the police aren't there yet, we'll meet her again. But we have nowhere to go. We're not going back! I've been here. I drove past here on the business trip before. There is a town nearby. We'll find the police there. Miss. What happened to you? You are injured. Are you alright? Do you need help? Really? You know what? At the gas station, I saw a white vest lying next to the exhaust pipe. I suspected that she blocked the pipe. That's what caused the problem. So I decided to keep an eye on her... ...and see what she wanted to do. I didn't tell you this... ...because I didn't want you to get worried. Hello, want a ride? Sir. This is their hotel registration form. Two women and one man. They paid in cash. No credit card. These are probably not their real names. Did you check their ID? No. It was really late that night. I was busy... I was very busy that night. So I didn't check. What crime did they commit? Theft? No... It must be prostitution. Yes, prostitution! I can tell that the man must be a pimp. The women don't look like decent woman either. I'm good at judging people, sir. I bet they fought over money. What do you mean? Next day early in the morning, those women drove away. Then the man rented a car and went after them. Those two women were in the same car, right? Yes. Did he register for the rental? Yes. Yes. That's right! It's him! I can tell even if he's been burned into ashes. Are you sure? Don't you usually pay more attention to women? Sir. I am not interested in women. The car in the bushes is a rental car. These are the renter's details. This is all we have for news flash today. Thank you for listening. Why haven't the police started investigating? Why haven't we arrived in the town? Did we take the wrong route? Let's keep driving along the road. There is nothing we can do now. You must be thinking I should have listened to you, right? I didn't. I'm happy to follow your decision. Don't I always listen to you? I follow and carry out cheeky girl's decisions. Why do you have to listen to me? Can't you make your decision? In fact, you just don't want to bear the responsibility. What do you mean I don't want to be responsible? It's her! She's a killer. Stop! Watch out! She is a killer! They should have a phone here. I'll call the police right now. Wait for me here. I'll go with you. You sit down first. What would you like to drink? Can I borrow your phone? I want to borrow your phone. -What? -I want to call the police. The phone is not working. It's broken for ages. Be careful. You have to pay if you break it. Wanna use phone? Use mine. There is a police car coming. Hey police! I want to make a report. IC please. Listen to me. Many people died. The killer is still chasing us. Don't move! What! We are victims! You are under arrest. Don't panic. We're safer when we're with the police. We go with you. It's her! She came after us. She is the killer! The opposite car. Get off now. Get off the car now. Are you out of your mind? You crazy woman! Why didn't you save me? Dawei, are you alright? You're bleeding. You should sit down. I'm alright. I'm alright. Find somewhere to hide. I'll divert her attention. When she leaves, you run back to the road, and call the police. No. It's too dangerous! I want to stay with you. Don't be stubborn. Now is not a good time. Hide and keep yourself safe. No, I won't do that. Together we make an easy target. No. If you don't slow me down, I'll definitely beat the woman. Do you still remember... when we were watching 'Titanic' together, what did you said to me? You said... "Jack wouldn't die..." "...if it weren't for Rose." No, I don't want! Listen to me. You can run faster than me. You stand a better chance of getting help. Have I ever made a wrong decision? I don't want to wait anymore. I was going to give you a romantic surprise. But I'm running out of time. Will you marry me? I... I have a surprise for you too. I... Come out! What should we do? My dear wife, do as I said. Run! -No, I won't! -Run! Run! Quick! Come out! Hey! I know your little trick. Do you think I'll fall for it? If you don't show yourself, I'll kill your girlfriend first. Come out! Come out! Dawei! Dawei! Wake up! Dawei! Just as I expected. How pathetic. Did he know he was going to be a father? Dawei! Weak women. Do nothing but cry. I'm really sick of it! What do you want? Don't you always want to run away? Now your fate lies in your own hands. What are you talking about? If I catch you, you'll be dead. Run! What on earth do you want? Just kill me! You want me to destroy his body? It's a psychotic serial killing. Only different is that this time, it wasn't carefully planned. It's not hidden. It looks like someone was on the run. They hate men to such extent, I bet they were hurt by men. Such a strange combination. Could it be one of those evil cults on the Internet? Like the suicide clubs. Men-hater clubs? The social networks for women who are let down by their marriages. Block the road. Send more police officers to patrol. Especially those suspicious spots along the road. Yes sir. Help me, help me! She is there! She killed my husband. Help me! I want your man. He is mine. Give it back to me! Leave the ring to me, and I'll let you go. Why are you doing this? Why did you choose us? What? Are you still clueless? Remember what I said to you at the gas station? Don't you think that you've got everything. Happiness is just an imagination. Why didn't he save me? Why did he save you? Yuyeon? You didn't have to die! Why did you leave me behind? Sung-jae. You said you loved me. You lied to me. So, now you're dead. What are you laughing at? I thought you had a good reason. Or at least some perverse reason to kill. But you're just a jealous woman who longs for love! You know nothing about me! Come on. Kill me. Get revenge for Dawei's death and kill me! That's why I hate the weak the most. You can't do anything at all. All you want is happiness. So, shut up! The game is coming to an end. Say hello to Dawei for me. Amy is an athlete. She is a good swimmer. It's a pity. He would be a good father. You are a crazy woman! I won't let you get away with it. Live on. Do you want to hear... ...the real story of mine? There's no need of that. You're just putting on another show. Yeah, that's right. No one cares about it. How do you feel about killing people? I think killing people... ...is very lonely. That's right. I feel very lonely. I'm sorry. That's alright. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Dawei. You still don't know... ...the surprise I had for you, right? We have a baby. It's a boy. Shall we named him Dawei?
