[FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING] Yeah. Furthermore... Where was I? Yeah! [PEOPLE SHOUTING, CHEERING] [LAUGHING, CHATTERING] And to the, uh, the father of our country, General George. General, here's looking at ya. [LAUGHING] [FIREWORKS CONTINUE] Well, it sounds like they're gonna be at it all night. I'm sure, if Bowie has anything to say about it. Before Miss Rebecca came along, I recollect us taking a taste now and again. 'Course, it wouldn't be right now. Not for a man about to be remarried soon. No, that wouldn't be right. Got a young son to set an example for, too. No small thing for a man. And a fine son he'll be, Colonel, following your sober example. -Thank you, Joe. -You're welcome, Colonel. -A man does what he can. -That's all a man can do. Still, they say the wine is fine. And the ladies are ready. How long you think those ladies are gonna wait, Joe? Well, we get finished here, like as not, I'm gonna find my way to California. -But not tonight. -No, sir. California ladies are just gonna have to wait. Tonight I'd like to hear what you're gonna say to that bunch over in San Antonio. Me too. You got any ideas? Well, I figure between here and there, you'll come up with something appropriate. -You always have. -I wish I had your faith, Joe. You know, Rebecca and I are going to miss you when you do go to California. Well, we'd best be getting you over there, Colonel, while the men are still standing. [MEN CHATTERING] [FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING] -Lucia, you can't come with me. -Why not? Girls aren't supposed to stand sentry duty, that's why not. -Says who, Daniel Cloud? -Lucia... Danny! Hey, watch... Pardon me, sir. -Oh, Colonel Travis. -Colonel Crockett. Well, you missed out on all my speechifying and about two quarts of tequila, which I don't care for particularly, but it does get the job done. -Where is he? -Oh, Bowie? Uh, he's in his quarters. I'd like you to join us, if you wouldn't mind. Oh, I'd just as soon leave them Texas decisions to you Texans. I'll know my duty when I see it. -Oh, I forgot. You're only a private. -High private at best. If you could just, uh, tear yourself away... Oh, all right. Did you say two quarts of tequila? Oh, some lemon, a little salt. And you sober up just like that? Oh, I had a little nap. Maybe you did wrestle that grizzly bear after all. No, I never done that. I just tickled him some and he fell off the cliff. Damnedest bear I ever seen. [KNOCKS] [SPEAKING SPANISH] It's all right, Mina. Evening, Davy. I feel we should issue a joint order terminating the festivities. -Oh? -I believe that Santa Anna's within -three days' march of us right now. -You do? Well, let me tell you something, Colonel. The generalissimo himself could siesta in the plaza over here tomorrow. Don't you think you've had enough to drink already? There's 2,000 Mexican regulars camped down the Medina River as we speak. And how much I've had to drink is none of your damn business. Impossible. All my scouting reports... Are based on eastern notions. ...confirm beyond the shadow of a doubt that it's impossible for Santa Anna's army to move that quickly. Horse apples. Moving an army from Pennsylvania to Illinois in the winter might be impossible, but Santa Anna's coming from Mexico. Now down there, they got mesquite. It dries where it stands, and a whole army can be moved on it, and it has. This isn't Boston and the American Revolution. It's Mexico, Colonel. Mexico. -Your man is reliable? -Juan Seguin? -A Mexican? -I'd trust him with my life. You may have. We all may have. Uh, I was about to say, even in the Congress a man gets offered a drink now and then. Help yourself. Well, I take it we're agreed then, Colonel Bowie. -Are we? -I'll be waiting for you in the plaza. I'll tell you something, if I hear one more comment about Mexicans from some damn Easterner... -Oh, I believe he's from South Carolina. -Is there a difference? Speaking as a Southerner, a lot of difference. You know, the only thing that man and I agree on is that San Antonio is the door to Texas. We got to keep that door closed, give Sam Houston a chance to build an army. Well, you'd best agree on something, considering what's marching straight at us. What about you, Davy? I don't figure Santa Anna's gonna keep marching on into Tennessee. Oh, ho! Let him try that. No. Well, Jim, it's a shame you missed all my oratory out there. I was inspired. Well, I do go on and on sometimes. But you know, every now and then, when I'm right in the middle of speechifyin', I can hear myself saying something that makes a whole lot of sense. Now, for instance, I was talking about George Washington, how he got the country going and all that, and without meaning to get allegorical or anything like that, it come to me that what I was talking about is right here and now. The government, people's rights. Now you got 40,000 Americans down here. They was invited down by Mexico, wasn't they? All right, help tame the place, give 'em citizens' rights. Then this Santa Anna comes along, he's gonna take their rights away from 'em. That's wrong. I'll fight that right down to the ground. I mean, even if... Even if the only land I wound up with was the six feet of dirt they throw on top of me. Might be all we wind up with, Davy. What is it, Mina? It is your men, SenorBowie. They are fighting with Colonel Travis' men again. Ah, damn. You know, these boys keep this up, they're not gonna have any fight left in 'em. Jim Bowie's a drunk. [GROANS] [WHOOPING, CHEERING] MAN: Georgie, you're wearing him down. -He called Jim Bowie a drunk. -I heard him. That's my brother. Sergeant! -Sir. -Get up, Private! I said, get up! I could have your stripes for this right now, Sergeant. Yes, sir. There'll be no more fighting. The next men found fighting will be put in the stockade. -Clean yourself up, Sergeant. -Yes, sir. I'd appreciate a little help in controlling your men. We are supposed to be a military unit. Jim... Don't you think you ought to save that for Santa Anna, amigo? I don't know. I swear, if we didn't hold rank, I think you'd beat the tar out of that kid. I still might. Davy Crockett, Juan Seguin. -Welcome to San Antonio, SenorCrockett. -A pleasure to be here, sir. -I hope you mean that, senor. -Oh, long as you keep throwing these wing-dings. Juan here can talk a mare out of her foal. He's, uh, kind of a Mexican Davy Crockett. -That a fact? -I'm hoping he can work some of that magic on our neighbors to the east here, bring 'em to our side. Thousands oppose Santa Anna. I don't think I will need much magic. Well, maybe not, what with General Cos turning tail, huh? What the hell? If he's going to give another speech, I think I'm going to miss it. Well, that'll be a shame. I'll be back as soon as I can with as many men as I can. In the meantime, mind your temper, Jim Bowie. [CHUCKLES] Don't know what you're talking about. Naturally. SenorCrockett. -Good man there. -Yeah, good man. -Major, I want a battle alert. -MEN: What? Now? Now, Major. MAN: Yes, sir? Talk. Agreed? Agreed. [MEN LAUGHING] After rendezvousing with General Sesma and General Cos, we will secure San Antonio de Bexar. With 4,000 men, these rebels will beg to pay my taxes. [LAUGHING] Excellency, according to Colonel Cos' report, -San Antonio may prove to be... -No! I will not go around. It is a question of honor. My brother-in-law was a coward, retreating from his post, leading 1000 brave men into disgrace. I will not allow any man to stain the honor of this army or that of any soldier. Of course, Excellency. Ah. [SPEAKS SPANISH] The Mexican soldier will march into hell if you keep his belly filled with sweet bread. [ALL CHUCKLING] Colonel Black. [ALL LAUGH] Soon we will dine in San Antonio. [FIREWORKS EXPLODING] [KNOCK AT DOOR] [BABY CRYING] Shh, shh, shh, shh. [KNOCKING CONTINUES] -What is it, Sergeant? -A thousand pardons, Lieutenant. -What is it? -You're wanted in the plaza, sir. Oh. Well, you can tell Mr. Crockett that maybe he can wrestle bears all day and drink all night, but we lesser men need our sleep. Pardon me, sir, but it's Colonel Travis. Colonel Bowie is with him. -All right, two minutes. -Yes, sir. If Bowie and Travis are together, it might mean good news. -And if it isn't? -Then I'll listen to Bowie. He married a Mexican. He'll live Mexican. Yeah, he'll know. Not that Travis ain't a good man, he is. -Where are my boots? -Right here. Susannah, all the same, I still think it'd be best if you got out of here. Now with Fannin's men here, the place is gonna be a madhouse, and it's no place for a woman and child. Almeron, you know how I feel about that. Pay mind to me on this, please. My work'll be a whole lot simpler knowing that you're not underfoot with all these soldiers around. They may be the best army in Texas, but that don't guarantee they got fitting manners. Really, Almeron, you act like I've been in some fancy parlor for the past eight months. I've been right beside you the whole time. It's gonna be a different place now. My mind's made up about this, Susannah. I'll come back before the Suelas come to collect you. [DOOR OPENS, SHUTS] [CLAPPING] Here, here. That's enough of that. -[ALL LAUGHING] -MAN: What's the news? The news is that Santa Anna's crossed the Rio Grande. [CLAMORING] MAN: What about Fannin and the boys from Goliad? MAN 2: And Sam Houston? What about him? Both Fannin and Houston are on the march to come to our aid. -When will they get here, Jim? -As of this moment... -MAN: How about it, Jim? -As of this moment, we are on a battle alert. -[CROWD MURMURING] -Is that your word on it, Jim? Boys, listen to me. I've only got one thing to say, and this is it. Now if Fannin and Houston want to take any part in this, they better get here quick. [CHEERING] Now as far as I'm concerned, Santa Anna's plans for conquest are gonna end right here. [MEN CHEER] This Texan doesn't lay down and play dead, and this Texan fights for his freedom. And I'm willing to bet that every last god-fearing man amongst you don't feel any different than I do. This is for Texas, boys. This is for Texas and freedom. [BAND PLAYING] LUCIA: Report, Private! -Lucia. -Did you miss me? Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Why aren't you on your daddy's wagon, leaving town? Because... Oh, Danny, I spoke with my papa and asked him if you could come with us and he said you could. -What? Why did you... -I want you to come with us, Danny. I don't want you to stay here. Oh, Lucia, you had no call to ask your pa that. You know I can't leave. Why not? This is my village. Why do you have to stay? Because I'm a soldier. Because this is gonna be our home. My pa, he didn't leave Kentucky when things got tough. -That's different. -You had no call. Santa Anna is slaughtering people, Danny. The village of Zacatecas doesn't even exist anymore. That was a peasant village. It's nothing like San Antonio. It doesn't matter. Tell me, how are you going to marry me, Daniel Cloud, if you're dead? -Huh? Tell me that. -Lucia, we're an army. We just sent General Cos and his men out of here running for their lives and we're gonna do the same to Santa Anna. Nothing is gonna happen to me. Oh, my brother's right. You are pigheaded. I want Texas to be our home. If I stay here and I do this, I'll feel like... Well, I'll feel like I have a right to it. -Then I'm staying too. -Caramba! Is this what every decision is gonna be like? MAN: Bring it around here. Steady. MAN: Rider coming. Hey-yo! What'd I tell you about that saluting, huh? Old habit, I'm afraid. The deference of the common soldier. Well, is that how you survived going to Russia with Napoleon, Louis? You deferred to everybody? A professional soldier must survive in order to receive his pay, n'est-ce pas? Yes, I suppose so. I never was too good at it myself. If I was, I'd still be in the U.S. Congress. I got a second chance out here in Texas, though, a political office. -I would vote for you, sir. -Would you? Planning on staying after the fighting then, huh? Well, I'm here for the land, Colonel. Where I come from, land is riches. And money is rights. And there's not much of either of those to go around. Not for a man like me. I expect you're gonna find your satisfaction then, soldier. -Thank you. -Colonel. Ain't much of a fort, is it? Well, that's all it's been since the Spanish gave it up in '93. You think they're gonna have any siege equipment? Too difficult to move this time of year. The way I see it, is our weakest position is that 50-yard stretch of picket fence between the chapel and the stone wall. Mmm-hmm. We'll have to have some earthworks. Jameson's working on it. I ordered Lieutenant Dickinson to place our 18-pounder by that picket fence and form our eight-pounders there and over there. Uh-huh. We are gonna hole up, then? I don't see any alternative, do you? Well, we could show 'em some Indian fighting. Get out there and whittle 'em down some before they get here. You take a small group, you fire and run, harass the holy Moses out of 'em. Wouldn't be no trouble for me and the boys. We did come here to fight. I don't think I can risk that with just 152 men. The way I see it, our job is to delay Santa Anna as long as possible. Make it as costly for him as we can. I'm telling you this, Colonel, because technically you and your men are not under my command. Oh. It seems everywhere I go, somebody's inviting me to leave. -I'm merely pointing out that... -The point is, Colonel, you and Jim Bowie got a lot more in common than you know, because he gave me the same speech. Now don't you worry about that 50-foot of picket fence. Me and the Tennessee boys'll hold that for you. We don't cotton much to walls. -[BELL RINGING] -Listen. Danny Cloud. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] -Hey! -They're here. Thousands of 'em. -TRAVIS: Where? -Well, they... They were there, I swear it. Uh, thousands of 'em. I saw the lances and pennons. I don't see anything but bushes and sand. CLOUD: I tell you, they were out there. -How old are you son? -Twenty-one, sir. I mean, I'll be 21 in 13 days, sir. -Oh. -Colonel, I saw what I saw. I believe you, son. Hey, where are you going? -Where do you think? -Are you a commander or a scout? You know something, Colonel? You're getting to be a burr under my saddle. That's fine. We'll both risk our lives then. How's that? It's ridiculous, is what it is. Your position's here. That's right. Same as yours, Colonel. -Dr. Sutherland. -Yes, sir? -All right, go ahead. -Can I take Smith with me, sir? Be quick about it. I want to know what's out there, if anything's out there. Yes, sir. If it makes any difference to you, I want to go just as bad as you do. Colorado! -What's going on? -We're going out. -Anything, Colonel? -Nothing yet. -How are we coming along with the cannons? -We'll be ready, sir. Sir, I was kind of wondering... Well, if you don't mind, I'd kind of like to go into San Antonio... Go ahead, Lieutenant. Take my horse and give Mrs. Dickinson my regards. Yes, sir. Thank you. I will. My Rosa Maria, she's been seeing him in her dreams for a month. -Who? -Santa Anna. Don't you think it's kind of suspicious, Colorado, how she's always dreaming about some other man? Don't bother me, as long as it's me she's in bed with. Holy sweet jiminy. There ain't that many people in all of Texas. Let's go. You go tell Bowie. I'll go to the Alamo. That damn horse took a fall. Colonel, we've seen 'em. As far as the eye could see. Cloud boy was right. We're gonna need some help. [BELL RINGING] Jim, it ain't nothing like I ever seen before. -Speak up, man. -He's here. Santa Anna's here. Let's go. -Don't you understand? -No! Listen to me, Almeron. I've got something to say and you better quiet down and hear me out. I did not bring our child 1,000 miles to see us separated. -Sue... -I believe the lord wanted us to start a new life. He brought us all the way out here to Texas to do it. You can't say I haven't been a good wife, I have. Coming all the way out here across the country like this. And you can't say I've ever been one to argue with the lord or my husband, but Almy, I am staying. Beside you is my place, and that's where I'll be. And you got a lot to learn, Lieutenant, if you think I got married to you for any other reason than to be with you. When did you decide this? -About two weeks ago. -Two weeks ago? Well, you might've told me. Can I stay? Yes. Yes. Oh, it would've tore me up to watch you leave anyway. I'll come back tonight and move us into the Alamo. [MOOING] [WHISTLING, CALLING] Whoa. Father, father. -I want to fight too. -No, you will not fight. But I am almost 13. I am old enough. The people you want to fight are our own people. Is it them you'd like to kill? But they march for Santa Anna. It is the dictator we fight, not our own. You will stay with the children and your mother. It is my promise to her. Come on. Speak. My general, our latest intelligence suggests the garrison has not been reinforced. "Suggests"? With conviction, General. Down. There are no more rebels left in the village? -None. -Our scouts were precise on that matter, Excellency. Quite. Our new scouts prefer to retain their tongues. History teaches us, gentlemen, that great generals remain generals by never underestimating their opposition. So you will understand that I will not move against the rebels until I know exactly, precisely, within a man, the size and disposition of the forces of General Sam Houston and Colonel James Fannin. And... I will sacrifice as many scouts as I feel is necessary to possess that information. Am I understood? Yes, Excellency. [CHUCKLES] I like you English. Your thoroughness, your worldliness, on behalf of my countrymen... But I do not like your fine manners. Manners win women, not wars. Perhaps if you English had realized that, the americanoswould not be a country to plague me now. Yes? Yes. Major! You have prepared my carriage? Yes, my general. It might do you well to remember, gentlemen, you serve under a commander who has never known defeat. You'll probably find Fannin en route, John. Give him this and bring him back here as quick as you can. Yes, sir. Are you sure about this? Not much help to you here, am I, Colonel? I can ride. This is for Ponton in Gonzales, directing him to rally those settlers to our aid. -We'll get it done. -I know you will, John. I'll get the horses. Colonel Travis, enemy in sight! Man sure is full of himself. Yeah. Anybody who calls himself el Supremo hasn't got much of a choice. What kind of guns are those that they're using? BOWIE: Well, believe it or not, those are discards from the Battle of Waterloo, courtesy of that Englishman Colonel Black. They're no good past 70 yards and they kick like a mule, but, uh, Santa Anna likes a bargain. That's a piece of luck for us, eh? Maybe. Sir, Lieutenant Dickinson would like to move the southwest cannons flush to the south wall before sundown, sir. -He'd like to see you as soon as you can. -I'll be right there. Yes, sir. Well, I don't think there's any hurry moving those cannons right now. There's more important things the man ought to be doing. You know, I cannot for the life of me figure out why Houston left you and I here in co-command, but surely you must remember that he sent me here to finish your job. You were supposed to destroy this mission and defied a direct order. I find it difficult to take advice from a man so ignorant of military procedure. Let me tell you something, tin soldier. You're the one that said it would be impossible for Santa Anna to make a winter march into San Antonio. Well, take a look over there. I'd say they outnumber us 20 to one, wouldn't you? I'll tell you, you got nothing to worry about, though. Santa Anna's a man of great patience. You're gonna have plenty of chance to play commander, right up until he decides to come over this wall. [BEATING DRUMS] Open the gate! Whoa! Judicious expedition? What the devil does Fannin mean by that? It means he's gonna proceed. Judiciously. He hasn't enough horses broken for wagon work, and he feels convinced that travel by oxen is gonna subject him to harassment by enemy forces. -At Goliad? -What enemy forces? Well, he believes General Sesma's in the area. Sesma's between us and the Rio Grande. How's he supposed to harass Fannin from there? Oh, he must be having trouble communicating with his scouts. Either that or he's a coward. Well, before we start impugning the man's character, Fannin's in a touchy situation. He's got the only real army in Texas. He's got to be cautious. There's more. What with Austin out of the country and Sam Houston god knows where, Fannin believes that he is commander-in-chief. And who's gonna dispute that? Fannin, commander-in-chief? Lord help us. -Well, who needs him anyhow? -We do, that's who. Three days. Fannin said he'll be here in three days. We'll just have to hold out, that's all. -That's right, we hold out. -CROCKETT: All right, it's settled. No, it's not. I want Major Bonham here to go off and find Sam Houston for us. -My place is here, Bill. -You'll be here, Jim. But I want our commander-in-chief apprised of our situation here, even if he is against it. Oh, he'll be against it, all right. [FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING] What the dickens is that? I was told, Excellency, this was the home of your friend Jim Bowie. During my visits to this part of our country, this home was always an oasis. An island in a province of desolation. I wish never to hear his name again. As you wish, Excellency. The life of a soldier, my dear nephew, as I'm sure you're learning, can be very tedious. Very tedious. The days, the nights... Her name is Elena Musquiz, Uncle. She's the alcalde's daughter. You're a good nephew, Ricardo. Make the arrangements. Excellency, it's a matter of some... Some delicacy. Her father, being the alcalde, is a local official, and... You've proven yourself capable in these matters before, Colonel. Thank you, Excellency. But if you'll allow me to... Colonel? Me? Thank you, Excellency. My general. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] MAN: Open it up. This is folly. Going to the aid of a military position that by all rights should've been destroyed, facing forces greater than my own and not one but two of my superiors gone and got themselves lost somewhere. But you are going, aren't you, sir? I have no choice. -Good. -Where are you going? To Gonzales to raise volunteers. They won't have a chance. When you get there, they will. Utter folly. You get any word at all from Austin or General Houston, you get it out to me on the double, is that understood? Yes, sir. [MAN SHOUTING] MAN: Come on, girl! Fuego! MAN: We're out of range. [LAUGHING, CHEERING] Lieutenant, what do you think? Well, I don't know, sir. I'd say the 18-pounder might do it. Lieutenant, I would love to give Santa Anna a proper Texas hello. Yes, sir. All right, boys, this is where we show the Colonel we know what we're doing. -Zanco? -Aye aye, Captain. -Primed and ready. -Elevation? Right on target, sir. It's a little unscientific, sir, but without a practice shot... Don't worry, Captain. She won't let you down. I sure hope you're right. Fire at will, Private. [CANNONBALL WHISTLING] [CHEERING] That man's got to have some Tennessee blood in him to get off a shot like that. Not a bad way to say hello, don't you agree? -I agree. -SUSANNAH: Colonel Travis? It ought to remind Mr. Santa Anna that we Americans are used to living under a constitution. We don't take lightly to people breaking their word. Indeed. We used charcoal and lamp oil. Well, my compliments to you and the other ladies. Will you fly it, Colonel? It'd be my privilege, Mrs. Dickinson. My privilege and my honor. Thank you. Thank you, Colonel. Mrs. Dickinson, ma'am, we're gonna be running low on rifle shot before long, and I was wondering if you and the other ladies might, uh, oblige us gathering and melting and so forth? We could cook on rocks. We can melt down our pots and pans. That'll be fine. I'll bet I could even make a flue somehow. I had an uncle who was a blacksmith, and I learned just about everything that he knew. Well, thank you, Colonel. -Taylor! -BOTH: Yes, sir? Let's give Santa Anna a history lesson, Taylor. Run that up. BOTH: Yes, sir. [MEN WHOOPING, CHEERING] Your Excellency, the flag. The flag? The one these rebels fight under. Am I supposed to understand that? The great invitation. Free land and the Mexican Constitution of 1824 lured 40,000 Americans to Texas. Former constitution. [SCOFFS] You English should talk. Your own king sent troops against these people, and they made a mockery of him in front of the world. Who are you to talk about Mexico? I have sworn an oath to defend her. The pledge of my presidency. Not one inch of soil will be ruled by rebels or foreign interlopers. Mexico, finally, for the Mexicans! Who are you to speak for my people? -Reinforcements, Colonel. -I make it about 100. Maybe it's Fannin's scouts, Colonel. You'd send scouts out ahead, wouldn't you? Yeah, but that doesn't mean Fannin would. CROCKETT: Rides like an Indian. BOWIE: That's Seguin! Man the gates! [MEN WHOOPING, CHEERING] No, it was the last Christmas I spent with you and Ursula, remember? It was your father-in-law that said that neither one of us could ride to Nagadoches and be back in time to the break the pinata. -That's right. -And we did! Yes. Did it in six days, as I recall. You know, I remember that because it was Ursula's last Christmas. I miss her too. That sickness took a lot of good people. Yeah, and leaves a damned old war horse like me. -That doesn't make any sense. -[EXPLOSION] Jim, I would rather stay with my men, you know. It has been three days now. Santa Anna is likely to attack at any moment. I don't think so. I think he's gonna wait and pick up his cowardly brother-in-law and then try to save the family honor. Besides, Juan, we need men. Who else are your people gonna follow? They will follow Jim Bowie. Well, I'm afraid there may be a few here that'll regret that before this is over. You know, if we don't see each other again... Juanito, you go and do what you have to. When you're done, you get your Mexican carcass back here. You understand? -Vaya con Dios, amigo. -Adios, hermano. MAN: Keep him covered! Fire! He's never gonna make it. Well, if anybody can, Juan Seguin can. Will you look at him go! A Comanche can't ride no better than that. [MEN LAUGHING, CHEERING] And have a blood flag prepared. When the time comes, I will want to carry it with me through Texas. -See to it. -It'll be taken care of, Uncle. You have attended to that other matter? Yes, it's arranged. Not by you personally, I hope. No, I sent Captain Rojales to speak to her parents. And as always, they were overwhelmed to think that their... Yes, yes, yes, I know. We will do it tomorrow. -As you wish, Uncle. -Splendid. -And Ricardo? -Yes? Again you called me "uncle" before the officers and the men. Your general punishes you. Your uncle loves you. Remain a loyal nephew, be a better soldier. Yes, Excellency. [COUGHING] We're critical on rifle shot. Yeah, I know. I don't figure we'll need the, uh, metal strapping on the wagon wheels anymore. That's a good idea. I'll tell Mrs. Dickinson. Right. Their campfires just about encircle us by now. You still think they're gonna wait to attack us? I do. It took 'em three days to surround this place. I don't think he's in any damn hurry now. [COUGHING] Doesn't sound like no drinking cough. -Does it matter? -It doesn't matter to me. Save it, Travis. I don't need another doctor. It's not your health I'm concerned about. Glad to hear it. You can drink yourself to death as far as I'm concerned. But maybe your family might... My family's gone, Travis. They're not here anymore. That's why there's a difference between you and me. You got that young lady waiting for you in Galveston. Waiting to marry you, isn't she? And that little boy? You come out of this alive, you can start a whole new life. Maybe even grab a little glory on the way. What are you fighting for? More like the old life, I guess, like it used to be. Like it is in America where the people own the government. You see, Santa Anna, he thinks he owns the people. I don't like being owned. I'm, uh, kind of particular about that kind of thing. So am I. You say you lost everybody on your wife's side of the family? Well, I've got a second cousin. I haven't seen him in about four years. Where's he at? Right over there in town. His name is General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. Yes, sir, there was 10,000 of 'em, all a-hollerin' and dancing around, screeching enough to make your blood run cold. Far as the eye could see, there was nothing but tomahawks and spears a-shakin' and brandishing. War paint spread all over them devils. It was a horrifying sight, I'm here to tell ya. Now I know you Texans have got your Comanches and Kiowas and them Apaches, and they are fierce, I'll grant you that. But they ain't nothing compared to your ordinary run-of-the-mill Creek Indian. Now them people are mean. They don't have to work on it none. They're born mean. It's in their blood. Why, a young buck ain't even considered a man till he's killed and scalped a dozen people, preferably white. Oh, yeah. And that ain't all. The squaws... Now them squaws are just as mean as the men and they're twice as ornery. Why, if they... Well, you'll have to imagine what I'm alluding to, with ladies present. [LAUGHS] But I can tell you this, you don't never let 'em take you alive. No, sir. Now then... Where was I? Oh, yeah. Over here on our side, we got old Andy Jackson and me and the Tennessee boys. In them days, Old Hickory was just a tree instead of a switch. That's back when we was friendly. Yeah. -So what happened next, Davy? -Well, sir, we looked out at that sea of savages, and old Andy and me both knew we was gonna have to be plenty smart that day if we was gonna come out of there with our hair still on our heads, formidable a foe as your average Creek Indian is. So whilst we was pondering it, it come to me like a bolt of lightning and I knew just what to do. "Line up here, boys!" I hollered. "Line up and shoot bow and arrows at 'em." -[ALL CHUCKLING] -Bows and arrows? Bow and arrows is what I said. I wish you'd been there to see it. Confounded the dickens out of 'em. Didn't know what to do. Naturally, they was assuming they was the only Indians in the neighborhood. "Hoo-hah, hoo-hah!" They was a-dancing around like that. Why, they got so het up, they plumb charged us. CLOUD: So? Well, sir, then we put down them bow and arrows and we picked up our long rifles. "Fire at will, boys," I hollered, and they done it. It was not a pretty sight, folks. Decimation. Bodies stacked up there like cord wood. Excuse me, ladies. And I'll tell you this, to this day, there ain't a single Creek Indian left in all of Florida. Not a one. [EXPLOSION] Now in the Black Hawk War... They've brought in heavy artillery. Travis! This is no attack. They want those ruins. That's not good. Those rifles could be effective from there. -Sergeant, post the men on the west wall right away. -Yes, sir! [ORGAN PLAYING] Dearly beloved... All right, all you ladies back to the barracks, please. Colonel Bowie, how can they... That's an order, Mrs. Dickinson. Do you, Antonio de Padua Lopez de Santa Anna take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? Fire! In sickness and health, till death do you part? I do. -Where are you going? -I'm going out there and make sure a prairie dog couldn't use those shacks. I'm going with you. Colonel Crockett, while Colonel Bowie and I are away from our posts, will you keep an eye on the place? -Glad to. -Are you coming? He's catching on. First intelligent thing I've seen the two of you do. The ring. I pronounce you man and wife. Now you may kiss the bride. [CHEERING] You were attacked by two men? Two rebels with torches, yes, Excellency. My officers retreat from two men with torches? Excellency... What will you do when you have to face gunfire? -Excellency... -Lead my army into shame? If you ever humiliate me in front of this town again, I will have your head on a lance. -Excellency, I take great exception to... -Do you understand? If I were you, I should say yes. Yes, Excellency. Now do you think I can trust you not to lose my army while I devote a few moments to my bride? This is my wedding day. Driver. Here you go, men. They closed the pouch, Sarge. We're surrounded now. Of course, it took 'em all of five days to do it. Ain't the snappiest army in history, I'd say. Just means it makes our job a little easier. See, all their ranks are a little more thinned out. How about Fannin and Houston? How are they gonna get through? I don't figure nobody can stop... -Sarge? -Sarge, you okay? I think I'm gonna faint. Sarge! I'd say about 200 yards. More or less. They still can't do much with them muskets at that range, even dug in. 'Course, a cannonball is a different matter. I'd give anything to find out how Major Bonham's doing right now. Ah, thank you for your help, Captain. You're welcome, sir. Begging your pardon, General. Can I ask you a question? Of course. Go ahead. Those Cherokee, they don't really call you Big Drunk, do they? [CLEARS THROAT] I'm afraid so, yes. Matter of fact, when I was living with them, they gave me two or three different names. Of course, that one was the most objectionable. Well, if you ask me, it just don't seem fitting, you sort of being a chief yourself, General. I'll confess something to you. If the Cherokee don't join up with Santa Anna, I have every intention of living up to that name in celebration. We've had little enough to celebrate, don't you think? Sure wouldn't want those delegates at the convention we're going to to hear it. Be like throwing a rattler into a henhouse. 'Course, that's only if you want my opinion, sir. Well, I won't tell if you don't. MAN: Rider coming! General Houston. Son, you're gonna get yourself shot you go charging around like that. I've been looking for you for three days, sir. Well, you found me. It's the Alamo, sir. They're under attack. General, did you hear me? Yes, I heard you. Well, we have to do something. Mobilize your army. It's Major Bonham, isn't it? General, we haven't time. It may have already fallen. Major, I don't have an army to mobilize. What I have is a ragtag army and a bunch of bickering politicians who can't agree on how to make a government. What I need is money and men from the United States. But these are loyal Texans who believe that you are coming to help them. I never made that promise, never. I never believed that San Antonio was the gateway to Texas. This broken-down mission in the middle of no place? No, I serve Texas better as a constitution-maker, not as the savior of unruly and insubordinate officers. Their blood will buy you time. You don't mind that, do you? Those men that you are willing to let die are my friends. Then if I were you, Major, I would wish to be with them. You're a coward, General. I rather wish I were you, Major. What I mean is, we're the ones that made it work here. Not the Mexicans, not the French. Even the Indians don't care for this part of Texas much. Mexico invited us down here. We made the land work. If we succeed now, that land will reward us. We can hold our heads high. What if we fail? Well, death in the cause of liberty does not make me shudder, Colonel. You wouldn't have any political ambition, would you, son? Me? No. -Glad to hear it. -No, I come to ranch. -That's a grand idea. -Yeah. I'm gonna get me some of that prairie cattle. Even got a piece of land all picked out. With Lucia, I bet. [CHUCKLES] Yes, sir, you bet. When I was your age, all I wanted to do was find some adventure like my daddy had in the American Revolution with George Washington. CLOUD: How about you, Colonel? I was in school studying the law, my wife pregnant. [FIDDLE PLAYING] If they ain't pelting us with apples, they're serenading us with music. Musicians alone could outnumber us. [CROCKETT LAUGHS] If you're coming in here full of vinegar, I'm not in the mood. I want to know why you're not marching for the Alamo. Would you care for a drink, Major? No? Suit yourself. Colonel, I want to know. Fine! You want an explanation? Maybe broken-down wagons would be of interest to you, or run-off oxen, or my own sense of responsibility to a command that as of this moment is the only army in Texas. Now would that be a good start for you, Major? Start of a damn catastrophe? Take a good look at my shoulder. You see that eagle? That eagle means that I don't have to explain anything to you, not one damn thing. No, sir, you don't. Fire! Jim! Go on back. Go on, boys. Go on back to your posts. Jim just got the wind knocked out of him. Go on. Jim, you hear me? Now can you walk? Got to do it for the boys. There. -How's he doing, Doc? -He's really busted up bad. It's a miracle he walked in here. Well, is there anything we can do for him? Well, I just gave him laudanum. Asked the good lord to spare him. I don't want him out where every man can see him, Doc, so put him in the chapel. -All right. -You let me know as soon as he wakes up. Doc, I don't want him to suffer. Davy, I wouldn't swap places with that man for all the gold in Texas. Oh, I guess he'd swap places with anybody today. I heard. -Is he gonna be all right? -He's unconscious. You gonna be all right? We need Bowie. I need Bowie. When I was growing up, my mama used to say, "Child, every man is born to a destiny. "Some good, some bad. "Some know god and some know the devil. "Some of us, most of us, I expect, "are somewhere in the middle. "But the thing is," she'd say, "we can't never know what that destiny is "until it's upon us." You know, the last time I thought on that was the night before I was to hang. I thought, thank the lord my mama's dead, 'cause I sure wouldn't want her seeing my destiny was swinging at the end of some rope somewhere. No, sir. But I didn't hang that next day because a white man believed in justice enough to save a black man from hanging. I figured I've known my destiny ever since was to follow that man. Give me cause every day to thank our lord. I figure by now, Colonel, you ought to know your destiny. The lord needs a good man to lead these boys to glory. Lead 'em outta here. Needs a man who makes no mistake about what this is all about. There's only one man I know like that. There's a powerful lot to be proud of in your destiny. Powerful lot. He's sleeping. He knew. He knew that he was going to die. With his family gone, he has nothing to live for. He has Texas. Colonel. Riders, sir. I'll be back. -Sergeant, I thought you were injured. -No, sir, Colonel, sir. My head's the least vulnerable part of my body. -[BAGPIPES PLAYING] -Reinforcements? Yes, indeed. They're leaving a dust cloud the size of Kentucky. -Thank god for that. -Thank him for me too. [CHEERING] It's Mexican, all right. Heavily supported column. General Cos has chosen the longest possible route to obey my orders. He's still a two days' march away from us. Perhaps it is due to the lack of water. Lack of water? Ha! The man's a coward! Lack of water didn't stop General Sesma and his men and he had a longer distance to cover. My god. No wonder these rebels sent him racing home like a little puppy. [CHUCKLES] I would have given anything to see Bowie's face as he watched Sesma march in with his men. Excellency, we are all in accord. What with the addition of General Sesma's men, the attack on the Alamo should take place now. -Is there news of Houston? -No, Excellency. It would seem that he's invisible. Then until he is visible, I will stand by my decision. We will not attack until General Cos gets here. Excellency, your sister SenoraCos is here to see you. -Here now? -Yes, Excellency. Of course. Bring her in. That will be all, gentlemen. Where is he? He's making every effort to get here. So he sends his wife to plead his case. No, Excellency. I come to see my brother. You haven't kissed me yet. Yes. I've missed you, sister. And I you, Antonio. He's a coward. He brings shame to our family, to your children. He's my husband. He's not worthy of you. Antonio, you're a great man. You bring honor to our family, to your children. You are beloved by our people. That is your destiny. My husband will never be the great man you are, Antonio, but I love him. And in this hour of need, I will do my duty by him, just as you will do yours for our country. You are a lesson to us all. BOWIE: How long have I been here? Two days. We're going on our seventh now. That long? How's the men, Travis? They've been better. I'm sending out personal notes along with this. I was wondering if you wanted to dictate something. No, I... Expect I'll be seeing the ones I love soon enough. Everyone else is within these walls. Can I get you anything? Don't be worrying about me, Travis. You got enough to think about. Read it. [CLEARS THROAT] "To the people of Texas "and all Americans in the world. "Fellow citizens and compatriots, "I am besieged by 1000 or more "of the Mexicans of Santa Anna. "I have sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade "for 24 hours. "The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion. "Otherwise the garrison are to be put to the sword "if the fort is taken. "I've answered the demand with cannon shot and our flag still waves "proudly from the walls. "I shall never surrender or retreat. "I call on you in the name of liberty, "of patriotism, and everything dear to the American character "to come to our aid with all dispatch. "The enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt "increase to 3000 or 4000 in four or five days. "If this call is neglected, I am determined to sustain myself "as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets "what is due to his own honor "and that of his country. "Victory or death." Travis? You're no tin soldier. Well, maybe on account of us, my boy won't have to do this. I figure that's worth something, don't you? -Evening, Colonel. -Evening, Major. -We got a wonderful night here, don't we? -Certainly is. Yeah. Nothing like an evening walk in the desert. Shame we can't just stroll beyond the walls, ain't it? -Dirty shame, ain't it? -Yep. There's nothing like it. Well, I have my rounds. Always a pleasure conversing with you, sir. Keep your heads low. Yes, sir. -Danny! -Lucia! -Where are you going? -Go back to the barracks. You shouldn't be out here. Don't do it, Danny. Please don't. You'll be killed, I know it. Lucia, go back to the barracks now. Danny. [CHATTERING, CHEERING] Fuego! [MEN LAUGHING, CHEERING] -Almonte! -Antonio. Shh. Why is it quiet? Excellency, our artillery has been attacked. Why is it you didn't inform me? Of all the men under my command, you're the one I expect not to let me down. -But, Excellency... -I am the one on the attack here. Me, not those traitors. I outnumber my enemy by 20 to one, and I can't even protect my own ordnance. -Where are they? -In the study, Excellency. [INHALES] The artillery, why can't I hear the artillery? No one? -Excellency... -Almonte! [SIGHS] Excellency, raiders from the mission disrupted our bombardment last night. Mmm. Hmm. But of course they were driven off and repairs are underway. I see. It's interesting, don't you think, that 150 men are so underwhelmed by our overwhelming forces that they send raiding parties against us? Do you think it's possible that they know something about this army that I do not? Hmm? I represent the will of the people of Mexico to put down a rebellion. I have never failed in my duty and I will not do so now. From now on my patience, my goodwill, you may no longer rely on. From now on, more than your payment in gold weighs in the balance. Much more. We will go home with honor or we will not go home. Understood? Am I understood? Yes, Excellency. I will hear the cannon fire resume within 15 minutes. Thank you. [EXHALING] He's mad. That's what he is. We, gentlemen, are commanded by a madman. No, he don't neither. Look, it's the gospel truth. That's plain heathen. I've never heard of no such thing. And when he gets tired of his new bride, he don't ship her off back to her parents. No, that'd spoil the whole thing. He sends her off to Mexico City to his wife. So the real Mrs. Santa Anna... The real Mrs. Santa Anna. -...gets the new Mrs. Santa Anna. -Right. Well, there must be some hellacious words exchanged over that. -I'll wager there are. -So what does she do with them all? -Yeah. -Only thing she can. She packs them all off to a monastery. And I'll bet there's a whole new order of nuns down there in Mexico City, and every one of 'em is an ex-Mrs. Santy Anney. No, they ain't, and I'll tell you why. Women ain't allowed in monasteries. None at all. Now you want a true story? I'll tell you a true story. There was these two fellas that was business associates, and one of 'em was a bit of a scamp. And he had some partners who were very unsavory. And they got it into their heads one day that they might not be getting their fair share of the profits, you see. So they decided they was gonna kidnap him and take him out in the woods and just chop his hands off. Oh, I forgot to mention that fella was a pirate, the first fella. Now the other fella, the one that ain't a pirate, he gets wind of that, see? And he figures he's just gonna jump right in there and help out his friend because the pirate had saved his life at one time. Well, sir, life's too short to be cautious, you see? And off he goes to the rescue, just a-rippin' and a-tearin'. Meantime, of course, them pirates, there's no flies on them, they're moving with alacrity, and they just went out there and gathered him up too. Now they're just fixing to chop the hands off of both of 'em when one of these rascals gets an idea. "What do you say," he says, "we have us a duel? "Now we'll get our meanest, orneriest, gouginest, "rompin', stompin', rough-and-tumble fighter "and we'll put him in a room with him and they'll go at it to the death. "Whoever's alive gets to win." "All right," they say. Off they go. Now it's pitch black in this room and there's nothing coming out of there except sounds of mortal combat. I mean, screeches and moans and grunts and thuds and whacks. Till finally that door flies open and the winner steps out. It's our fella. Now that was down in Louisiana bayou, June 23rd, 1826, and the one that was a pirate was Jean Lafitte. The other fella, the one with all the guts, the man I always wanted to meet... Was Jim Bowie. Finally got to meet him. And he can still fight some. [CHUCKLES] [MEN SHOUTING] -The battalion of the Cazadores. -What? Cazadores is my hometown, where my family is from. I saw their flag. You still have family there? My brother. Riders coming in! They're definitely not Mex, sir. Give 'em cover! -Is it Fannin, sir? -I don't know. -It's Colorado Smith! -Come on! All I know is when I was there, he said he was leaving. I seen them all mounted up and getting ready to ride out. Then in Gonzales I ran into Doc Sutherland and Lieutenant Kimball here. -Sir, Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers. -At ease. -He told me Fannin isn't coming after all. -That's a fact, sir. -I got a brother at Fort Defiance. -And that was two days ago, while Juan Seguin was apprising these boys of our conditions here. -And you came anyway? -Yes, sir. Seguin is going on to Lavaca to see if he can roust up some more volunteers for us. What about Major Bonham? You see him? I sent him off to find Fannin also. We heard something, but it didn't make much sense. What was that? Sir, an Apache scout informed us that a white man was seen headed into Cherokee territory. -What? -The description sounded like Bonham. And you know the Apaches, sir, eyes like a fox. Cherokee territory is two days' ride from here. It's possible, I guess. Maybe Houston's meeting with the Indians to try to keep them out of this thing. Well, that may be, sir. Houston's not at the convention and our new governor's mad as the dickens about it. Says he's gonna drop him as a delegate if he don't show up soon. What convention? The provisional government, sir. You didn't know? Well, Lieutenant, you're our first acknowledgement from the outside world. It could be snowing in Galveston and we wouldn't be aware of it. Well, sir, Governor Smith has called a convention at Washington-on-the-Brazos, and he's sworn not to let any member go until Texas has a constitution. Texas is declaring its independence, sir. Why, there's even talk we may become part of the United States of America. Well, I'll be. Kimball said that we were the reason the convention was called. -You know what this means? -It means that Santa Anna's an invader. It means that flag out there's the flag of independence. They'll have to send us reinforcements now. What are they shooting at there, George? Looks like they're shooting at each other. It's Bonham! Cover fire, men! Man the gates! Jimmy. That is a two dollar hat. You recall the first time we did this? We were 12. Back of Jedediah Peckle's barn, down from your daddy's spread. I believe you had the first drink then too. -But I believe you finished the bottle. -I don't recall that. Well, you wouldn't. I carried you home. [LAUGHS] Now he remembers. My daddy polished my butt like never before. Pastor's son drinking like that? He wouldn't stand that, no. No, sir. Not a proper man like the reverend. We couldn't be further from Carolina, could we, Jim? Not much. Miles and years. Yep. He's not coming, is he, Jimmy? No, Buck, he's not coming. He give you a good reason? He had a reason. I called him a coward. You called Sam Houston a coward? -I'm afraid so. -Really? I wish I could've seen that. They'll probably want to court-martial me. They'll probably want to hang you. Probably. You really called Sam Houston a coward? I'm afraid so. How come you could always drink more than me? You ever notice that? -It's easy. -It's always annoyed me. It's your damn conscience. Always gets in the way. -Damn nuisance. -No argument here, counselor. Well, Jimmy, I'm afraid my conscience has gone and got us killed this time. Looks like it has, Buck. I'm sorry. Some of you men are probably asking yourselves the same questions I'm asking myself. I can't answer them for you. You can't answer them for me. What I do know is this. This is not about land or money. It's about the one thing that no man should ever be able to take from another man. The freedom to make his own choices about his life, where he'll live, how he'll live, how he'll raise his family. We face a man who would take those god-given rights away from us. Well, not from me, he's not. There can be no doubt about the price. General Houston will not reinforce us, as he is still assembling his army. We can expect no aid from Colonel Fannin, as his position is untenable. For the past 11 days, you have done more than any man has the right to ask. I'm honored to be among you. Those men who wish to stay will cross the line and stand with me. The others may go with my blessing. Damn it, boys, somebody carry me over, will ya? TRAVIS: Go with god, mon ami. I suspect god'll be staying here with us, Colonel. Gonna miss out on a good ruckus, Louis. Thank you, my friend. I didn't survive Russia and Waterloo to die in this desert. Maybe soldiering is all that I will ever know. I'd wait until dark. Yes, sir. -Major Evans. -Sir? That special ordnance I gave you, is it still in safekeeping? -Yes, sir. -How many would you guess there are? -I guess there are about 12 bottles, sir, exactly. -Exactly? Yes, sir. Well, why don't you break out those 12 bottles, Major Evans? -I think the men feel a thirst coming on. -Yes, sir. At your posts, though, gentlemen, if you don't mind. Lieutenant, Gregorio. I wasn't going to make it an order, but I thought you should evacuate your families. -It's not so easy, Colonel, not for my family. -Or with Sue, Colonel. Well, I thought if they could all make it to your farm, Gregorio, it would be the smart thing for you to take them. Thank you, Colonel, but I'm a collaborator. I cannot go back. Well, then your family alone. Santa Anna kills the families of collaborators. It's the same with Sue, Colonel. I wish to heaven I'd gotten her out of here when I had the chance, but I can't see sending her out there now. Besides, she wouldn't go. The decision has been made. God has taken it out of your hands. Well, the decision is his, but I bear the responsibility. GREGORIO: Vaya con Dios, amigo. Gregorio. I would've been a terrible farmer. Are we getting paid for this? No. It ain't enough. How long you been with Davy? Oh, about two years. Bet you've seen a little bit of fighting, huh? Some. Gonna see some more. [MAN COUGHS] What do you make of it? Well, if they was Indians I'd hazard a guess, but I don't know about Santa Anna. Man's peculiar. I don't understand it. The man's got his reinforcements. Why doesn't he attack? Never at the height of the day. The man hates heat. See, he's smart. Gives his men a rest, gives ours a scare. I'll bet there isn't a man sleeping in this fort right now. Oh, that's a safe bet. Yeah. Well, he wears us down without firing a shot, but, see, he forgets one thing. I know him. I know about the voices. What voices? In his head. His ancestors. He thinks they talk to him. See, he thinks he's descended from the sun god. You know when they talk to him loudest? -When? -Early in the morning. El Magnificothinks his ancestors talk to him loudest in the morning. That's when he'll attack, boys. Have the men rest up. Be ready to go before sunrise. [SOBBING] Lucia, what... Lucia, what is it? -Ask me to marry you. -What? Do you love me? -Lucia, you know... -Then tell me right now. I love you. And you were going to ask me. That's true, isn't it? Well, I still am. I'll talk to your pa tomorrow. Then ask me right now. Uh, will you marry me? CLOUD: Yes. Congratulations. -Lucia... -Shh. Uh... [CLEARS THROAT] -Lucia, I... -Shh. Quiet, Danny. Colonel. Colonel. Colonel. Colonel. It's 4:00, Colonel. Is there any movement? Along the west and south wall. Enough to wake up the men. Oh, good. You were able to get it? Joe, if we get to go to sleep tonight, do I have to give up my bed again? No, sir. Good. It's looking like Jim called it right. I thought you might want to come with me. Yes, I would. You know, they used lamb's milk mixed in with the mortar when they built this place. Accounts for the color. Conceived in milk. Well, that's, that's appropriate. And christened in blood. Davy, could you bring the women and the children in here? Have the boys move me over by the door. [DRUM ROLL] [MEN SHOUTING IN SPANISH] [BUGLE FANFARE] El deguello. It means no mercy. Cut their throats. [SHOUTING CONTINUES] -Fire. -Fire! Cease fire! -Cease fire! -We got 'em on the run, Colonel. Check the guns, Lieutenant. [MEN CHEERING] MAN: That was good shooting, men! Good shooting! He never got the reserves into it. Cavalry got in the way. They'll be smarter next time. I'm afraid so. [DOOR OPENS] Excellency. - El deguellohas stopped. -General Cos is dead. Colonel Duque was trampled by his own men. Our troops are in retreat. I ain't never been in a battle like this before. You know, I've seen some fighting like to scare my britches off, but nothing like this. Kind of sets in your middle, don't it? You always want to swallow. Can't get the sweat off your hands no matter how you rub 'em. You think you're alone, boy? You too? What you think? Anybody's any braver than you are? Well, we ain't. Not a one of us. Older don't mean braver. Y'all thought on it much? About what? With all I done, I tell ya, I ain't one time had to think about dying. Not like this. I never been real strong on thinking, but the way I see it about the bravest thing any man can do is decide how he wants to meet his maker. Boy, if this is brave, it ain't nothing like I'd figured. I give you a rabble of less than 200 men, and you humiliate me and my army. Then you insult me to my face by trying to explain it. You're nothing more than court jesters versed in charm. A real soldier... A real soldier would have taken that position or given his life trying. Done it for me. How am I to get conscripts if these rebels are not crushed? Victory... Or death. Let me make it clearer. My victory... Or your death. I do not want to see a single man left alive. All I want... Are flames. [FANFARE] [MEN SHOUTING IN SPANISH] El deguello! [BUGLE FANFARE] [MAN SHOUTING IN SPANISH] Fuego! Fire! MAN: Move that cannon around! This way. Turn it! Go! [SCREAMING] MAN: They're coming up! [GROANS] Come on, Jack! [HORSE WHINNIES] [GROANING] [ALL WHIMPERING] [SCREAMS] [GROANS] [GROANS] [WOMEN SCREAM] Come on. Come on. [POUNDING ON DOOR] [GROANS] [SOBBING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] It's an order. BLACK: Mrs. Dickinson? My husband? There are no survivors, ma'am. His Excellency has expressed a desire to meet you. You can tell His Excellency that I have no wish... Mrs. Dickinson... If I may be so bold... Accept his invitation. The life of your child and your comrades depend on it. And... Why should Santa Anna's version of your husband's bravery be the only one heard? [SOBBING] [DRUMS BEATING] Excellency. You know what I wish to see. I found Colonel Travis and the man Crockett, but I have not yet found SenorBowie. Then do it. I will dip my fingers in their blood. Mrs. Dickinson, Excellency. Madam. I ask that my daughter and the others be spared. For myself, I would have fought with the men. You're very courageous. Tell the others what you've seen. Tell them what will happen if they stand in my way. Send her to the north with the others. I do not make war on women and children. Just the freedom of your people? Wine. I will drink to my victory. Our general drinks to the victory that will cost him his war. TRAVIS: This is not about land or money. It's about the one thing that no man should ever be able to take from another man. The freedom to make his own choices about his life, where he'll live, how he'll live, how he'll raise his family. We face a man who would take those god-given rights away from us. Well, not from me, he's not. There can be no doubt about the price.
