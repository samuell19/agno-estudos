HOMECOMING No livestock on the bus. You'll be fined. The ferry. Everybody off. Here. Take mesa. Get off, get off. Whose stuff is this? Hey, Miss, wanna buy some tangerines? Free samples. Taste it, try it. - Tangerines aren't as sweet as sugar cane. - But they shouldn't be this sour. You've seen the world. You should know, right? What a smooth talker. Honestly, the ones in this bag are sweeter, but they cost more. You want a taste? I want the sweet ones. Too late now. Why didn't you say so earlier? Don't worry. There are a lot of sweet ones in there. - You're quite the businessman. - I'm the businessman's professor. Serves you right, serves you right. Miss, are you from Zhuangyuan village? Yes. - Are you from the Zhuang family? - No, my family name is Zhang. I'm a Zhuang. Going back to see relatives? No, to visit my grandmother's grave. She died recently. I'm retired and going back to live in the village. I have this letter in English from my son. I don't understand it. Can you read it for me? Your son is at UCLA. He's the third. The eldest works in Australia. The second, a daughter, is married and lives in Canada. You have good fortune. You dropped something. Are you alright? Rest right here. I'll go to the village for help. They're coming... They're coming... get ready. One, two, three. A warm welcome to returning compatriots from Hong Kong. Welcome, welcome. Welcome. Down at the ferry... This is the district's prize winning goose. Let's go and eat, the soup's getting cold. - Where's the girl from Hong Kong? - Down at the ferry... - But she's not part of your unit. - She fainted at the pier. Why did she faint? I don't know. I traveled with her. Uncle Zhong, who's going to fetch her? How about you? Hurry up. Let me take it. Request electricity tonight. After dinner we'll irrigate the fields. Don't push. There's enough for everybody. Come and thank Mister Tiao. Let me get off. The mad's muddy. Why get off? I'm feeling much better. Walk on that side, it's dry. I hardly recognized you just now. I recognized you right away. How many children do you have? One. A boy? No, a girl. Where's Ah Zhen? At the County Educational Bureau collecting an award. She must be a good teacher. Yes, she's the principal now. Oh. What happened to the old principal? He retired and moved into town. What happened to his daughter? She was in our class. She married someone in Harbin. It's cold up there. Yes. They get lots of snow in winter. What about your best friend, "Monkey Ass"? He died last year. Died? Yes. Last July, we were working in the fields. He was in front of me, carrying a sack of fertilizers... he suddenly fell down dead. Was he ill? No. We buried him the next day. It was hot. I never thought people our age would just die. Yes. Are you a party cadre now? No. - I'm still just a farmer. - Still working in the fields? Since she's head of school, Ah Zhen's a party cadre. Bless the village. I watched her grow up. Hello. Come and visit us. I'll go first. Shan Shan. Shan Shan. - Haven't seen you for ages. - Yes. - Come and visit us when you have time. - Yes. - Come and visit. - Alright. Birth control is the priority - the nation's policy. Praise the one-child family. Please go back. Thank you, goodbye. Come in, come in. Use the main entrance. Shan Shan, please come in. - Shan Shan. - Aunt Zhong. How nice. You're back. Th is way, please. Look, it's empty. The basket is still here. - Have some sweet potato. - While they're hot. Here's a clean towel. Wash your face. Thank you. Put on the slippers. Do you get enough food these days? I have more money than the Village head. Shan Shan. What should we do with this house? Whatever you say, Uncle. You're the elder. Alright, alright. Let me know if you have problems. It's a blessing when old people die. Don't feel bad about it. Dear Sister, I'm back in our ancestral home. Nothing's changed since we were kids. Opening the door again, twenty years have past. Now you and I are the only two left in the family. Shouldn't we be able to sort things out together? It makes me sad that we only talk through lawyers. Life hasn't been good to us in recent years. But if we don't help each other, no one else will. It breaks my heart... if Mom, Dad and Grandmother knew we were fighting like this, they'd be heartbroken too. - Thank you. - Alright. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Principal. - How are you? - You're back. - Yes. Tie your shoelaces. No lessons? Principal, did you collect Qiang's award? Show us. Find Qiang. Don't play. Here's the award. You should all follow his example. Be careful with it. Guess who. Who is it? Who's that? Don't fool around... Ah Zhen, it's me. Shan Shan. When did you arrive? Last night. Last night? A pity. I was away collecting a school prize. My pupil was sixth in the county's math competition. What a bright boy. He's Uncle Zhong's son, Qiang. Have you met him? Look, here he comes now. Why are you so obstinate? Oh, it's you. You know each other? Yes. He's my professor. Your professor? He taught me that tangerines aren't as sweet as sugar cane. Without "fat" there's no "thin," without bone there's no meat. The best meat is on the bone. I hear you're the principal. A very important teacher. Not that important. What are you staring at? Off to your lessons. Beannie, your mother's back. Have you seen him yet? Yesterday, but there was no chance to talk. Tsong. Look. Well, shake hands. My hands are dirty. Beannie, what kind of bird is that? Look, it's wonderful, the beak is so sharp. These fish balls aren't so good. But the vegetables are fresh. Don't add too much salt. - Need any help? - No. No, let him do it. We'll go inside and talk. Come, this will be for just us girls. Beannie, go and help your father. I want to have a good look at her. No, I'll help Dad. I like cooking. Sit. - Hang your coat. - No thanks. - Have some tea. - Take a break. Drink a cup of home-brewed tea. - I like the way you've done your house. - Tsong works hard. Your daughter's such a big girl. Do I look old? No. No, you're still as good looking. You're just saying that. You're still young and pretty. That's all make-up. What are your plans while you're here? Can I help? I've come to see what life is like here. See for yourself. The air's good. People here are healthy. You remind me of the carefree old times. When things got too much in Hong Kong, I'd think, "what's Ah Zhen doing?" What am I doing? Still eating chalk dust at our old school. No, I just want to chat with you, over a drink. But we don't drink. Oh, I didn't know you drink. Beannie. Don't bother. I don't drink during the day. Next time. Do you drink with friends a lot in Hong Kong? They're not real friends. In my circle, every/body's after something. No intimate friends. What about your sister? I'd like to chew her up. What's wrong? Don't mention her. I came here to avoid her. Time to eat. Food, food. Your husband really looks after you. Alright, stop chewing up people. Shan Shan, eat up. Don't give me anymore. - Here, have a few more slices. - Enough, enough. Eagle meat is good for you. Have another slice. I meant to catch a fish, but I came back with an eagle instead. He's crazy. When you were little, you ate anything. You must have tried the best "cuisine"? Everything tastes good to a child. I don't think this tastes very good. Children shouldn't talk so much. Just eat. I was eating this along the way. There's some left. It's delicious. Really good. It tastes good. Ah Zhen, you try. Shan Shan, how much does it cost? $10 for three packets. What? The packaging alone must cost $3. I thought I might take the children to Guangzhou. Open their eyes. I'm from this school too, after all. You want to take Beannie? Yes, and all the senior class. That will be expensive. Did you help Grandmother write her letters? - Dad helped carry her coffin. - Aren't you eating your dinner? Have you been to your grandmother's grave? Yes. The whole village turned out for her funeral. She didn't go alone. Dad died ten yea rs before her. It's sad that she didn't know. But didn't you send her his photo last year? My family is ill-fated. You're different. You bring good fortune to your family. Have a look. Does he bring good fortune to me? Shan Shan, look at mine too. Dad, Old Wu from the next village was beaten up last night. He's no man. He stole my cow manure last year. Uncle Zhong. Principal. Uncle Zhong, Shan Shan has donated these children's magazines to the pupils. She also wants to take them to Guangzhou. Good. Open their eyes and have some fun. And she's talking of scholarships for going to university. University? All of them? Who's going to work the fields? If they went to university, we wouldn't need them in the fields. We'd use machines to plow the fields. Can machines feed geese? Uncle Zhong, aren't you always saying that the Zhong family were scholars? That's ancient history. If Qiang leaves, who will watch the livestock? Who will live in my new house? Qiang. I asked Uncle Zhong. He refused. Why ask him? He's head of the production brigade. But why? It's not his money. I just don't understand. I'm sorry. You'll understand in time. I'm going- Stay and talk to me tonight. No. - Can't bear to be away from your husband? - Can't bear to be away? - Would you dare sleep here tonight? - Why wouldn't I dare? You're like a new bride. Just like twenty yea rs ago. You really know how to handle him. Men need proper handling. How do you get your own way? He used to be the bossy one. I go to study meetings often. Aren't you afraid of losing him? What? You're joking. So, what's your man's name? Man? No man. No husband, either. What do you have then? Just boyfriends. Who do this... and more than one. Are you really like that? Why not? Don't you want a family, at your age? What for? A bed and kitchen are enough. What a bout children? Wait much longer... and you'll be past it. What's the matter? Crying.? Never mind. Let's go to sleep. Miss Zhang, this letter is for you. Thanks. Something to drink? Coca-cola. Doesn't matter. I've just been to see if there was a letter from my son. So I brought your letter for you. Who's it from? My sister. That's nice of her, writing so soon. I don't know what's going on with my son. Still no letter. I hope he hasn't had an accident. Don't worry. I'm used to worrying. When they were small, I worried about my job. Later, I worried about them respecting me. Since they've gone away, I still worry about them... School's over. Go home. Have you fed the pig? Can't you hear it squealing? There were lots of leeches in the field today. Let's see, what's this? You're obsessed by a piece of wrapping pa per. She obviously had quite an effect on you. Shan Shan? She's just... Close friends, huh? All three of us were. OK. I don't want it anymore. Tired? You rest. I'll go and make dinner. I'll get the firewood. The Ho family great grandfathers are back from Australia. I heard they're twins, and also over a hundred years old. Beannie. Going to bed without eating? Aren't you feeling well? - Where did you get this? - I borrowed it from Shan Shan. You don't borrow books but you borrow this? Making yourself look like a monkey. Wash it off. Go. Give it back. Alright, you can eat first. What kind of soup is it? Shut up, please. Don't hang up or you won't get a cent. What? I said be quiet. Get the lawyer to sell the land immediately. The longer it drags on, the less it's worth. Everybody loses. I don't care. I want my share. You've wasted Dad's entire estate. What estate? If it wasn't for the government purchase, there'd be no money. That was your poor judgment. Swapping a field for a piece of wasteland. In all that time, what have you ever done? When times were hard all you did was complain. You don't deserve a cent. When we first went to Hong Kong, Dad and I worked in the fields. It was hard work raising you. Dad's been dead for ten years. Who sent you abroad to study? If you hadn't sent me, I wouldn't be like this. It's not my fault your husband left you with these brats. Be quiet, please. - You've always been like this to me. - Because you've always been stupid. I've got nothing else to say to you. Bring me the cotton for the embroidery. - What colors do you want? - All of them. The moon makes shifting patterns On the wall and the fence on the bed... on the curtain with the goose embroidery... Oh, sorry. We're measuring the tree. - So am I. - Hello great grandfathers. Hello. You're the esteemed great grandfathers Han and Tang? Yes. We're twins. He's older. It's been ninety yea rs but this tree hasn't changed one bit. When were you two born? The 18th year of Guang Xu's reign. We left when we were fifteen. That's right. How old is this tree? Our elders told us it was ancient. Faster... I'm faster than you. Qiang, wait for me. I came here often when I was little. We came here often when we were little too. Go. Go. Go and get the laundry in. Go. What do you think of the space ships? Can ships really take people into space? Yes. Can we go too? We can. The goose as well. What happens if it breaks down? No, it won't. Yes it will. Man-made things always break down. Didn't the bus break down when you came? The space ship on TV didn't look as good as in your magazine. Really? Just a black ball of fire that disappeared quickly. Not as nice as fireworks. The colors you painted here are so bright. Better than the real thing. You must be a famous artist in Hong Kong. Qiang. Qiang. Playing. Come down Quick, come down. What's that? A goose. You think I'm a three year old who doesn't know about airplanes? You don't know anything about space ships. Who cares? Go sell the tangerines. Tangerines? You won't let Shan Shan take us to Guangzhou. If you don't let her, I won't. You what? I'll give it more thought. Off you go. Go on. If you lie again, I won't come home. If you don't get a good price, don't bother. I'll help you. It's dirty work. Never mind. - You must be exhausted. - No. I told you not to. You're not as fit as you used to be. Is it a hard life in Hong Kong? Ah Zhen's fitter than you. Do the kids help with the harvest? Yes. Kids today are smarter than we were. Yes. I want to take them to Guangzhou. I heard Uncle Zhong wouldn't let you. I can't convince him. You try. If you can't, I can't. Uncle Zhong trusts you. You're honest. Me, honest? Pay me after you sell these tangerines. You sell wholesale to me and still want 90¢ a catty? I worked it out. You make $2.50 this way. Don't forget. I won a math award. - No umbrella? - Can I borrow yours? It's pouring. Tsong changed a lot lately. Even more docile? No, he's not so honest. That's good. If men are too honest, they're stupid. You asked him to have a word with Uncle Zhong? Anything to do with the school has never interested him. He doesn't understand. The rain's never going to stop. Yes. Spring brings the rain. If you don't leave now, you'll be stuck here. Please yourself. I know my way around here. I didn't mean that. It's the rainy season. I'm in no rush. I don't want to go back anyway. Time to eat. I'll see you home. Let's take some pictures when things get better. It's not easy getting them ta ken in the village. We're here. Stop the bicycle. Thank you. Try this olive pit charcoal. Beannie brought fit. Thank you. Have some tea. Are you building a new house? No, I'm making do with renting a place. Our new house is nearly ready. Two stories, a living room, a bathroom... You're both blessed with good fortune. My son sent this letter in English. Can you help me? From UCLA. He's bright. He's my third child. The eldest works in Australia. The second is married in Canada. My third is the smartest. He went to UCLA last year. Tiao, you also have good fortune. Good fortune? My wife was ill for eight years; completely bed-ridden. We tried the best doctors and every type of medicine you could imagine. She still passed away. You're a good man. You know those bamboo rafts? Traveling between here and Hong Kong is so easy. We went much farther. To Australia. According to old tales, people sailed there on bamboo rafts. Here we are, Shan Shan. - Will it be okay here? - Yes. - It's a good background. - Right. Beannie. Come over here. It's just a picture, not an execution. Sit properly. Come on, button your jacket. Liven up. We're smiling. Press the button already. My turn. Take one of me. Look at the camera. Why didn't you bring the award? Too much trouble? It's not trouble. Finished. Let's have a look. You have to do that? Isn't your camera the latest model in the world? It's coming out. I must get back to the fields. Be back early for dinner. Where's spring? Where's spring? Uncle Zhong's changed his mind. He came to tell me. Thanks for your help. He's the Village head. If he says so, then you can take them. What do you think? It's so heavy. Doesn't Tsong help? Don't always bring him into it. You've been drinking bitter vinegar for twenty yea rs. It's you who's bitter. Me... I'm pickled in vinegar. Even my flesh is bitter. Does Tsong still want you all the time? No. Is he still as good to you? Come down You've got everything. A husband, a daughter. I'll be an old maid for life. Can't you have children? I've been pregnant twice. Boy? Girl? Abortion? You had abortions? Why weren't you more careful? The first time, I was careless. I aborted it at three months. It was terrible. Like killing a blood relative. The second time, it was a different man. At first, I wanted to keep the child. But I stopped loving him. I went to the same hospital. Same bed. Same doctor. Oh, Shan Shan. Look at those birds... making their nests for their young. One naughty boy can destroy it all. You're alright. Good marriage. Good husband. A happy family. Happy? Maybe. But sometimes it lacks spice. Oh, what I would give for a simple life. They're so affectionate. Married three yea rs and still the same. Any children? I doubt she can have any children. She goes to town every week to see the doctor. Tsong, why aren't you coming? If it takes so long to wash your feet, sleep in the tub. You're letting mosquitoes in to bite me. Stay out there, let them bite you. Where did you get this? Beautiful material. Only the clothes is beautiful? Silly. If that's what you like, I'll sew it up to here. No early school tomorrow? What are you thinking? About Shan Shan. It's so sad. She's already had two abortions. Were they girls? No, she didn't even have a husband. Is she well off? No, the magazine is a flop. Her business is bankrupt. Her sister is suing her. Her life there is hard. What are you thinking? Nothing. No more thinking. Go to sleep, alright? Enough? - Have some more. - I'm full. Eat up, Beannie. I'll get the desert. Keep Shan Shan company. Beannie. Beannie. - No more. - A little more. - Enough. - Beannie, eat in the kitchen. No, I want to eat out there. Mom will tell you a story. Great. Which story? Once upon a time... Shan Shan. You had a sad life out there. Ah Zhen and I understand. Don't be depressed. Our door is always open to you. You're always welcome here. Our home is your home, our daughter your daughter. Mom. What's Dad doing? Dad is telling Shan Shan a story. I can tell this story too. Yes? Our food is your food, Our clothes your clothes. Our shoes are your shoes, our bed your bed. Where's Shan Shan? Principal. Going home? Tsong. Look at that kite. Like the ones we had when we were small. Who made it? What else have the kids got to play with? The same things we had. Look how well Qiang treats the girls. Girls are so petty. Always quarreling. You're unhappy in Hong Kong. It's because... you're too... straight-foward. Leeches. The leeches are biting you. Come on. What for? Come with me. Shan Shan, forget it... Tsong, free to come to town today? Oh yes. I've fertilized the fields three times today. - And it's too early for planting. - Bye. We have to get going. - Tsong. - Hello. Shan Shan, forget it. Try them on. They're no use. Can't wear these in the fields. Don't have them then. Shall I wrap them? No... Don't they fit? Good fit. Thanks. It nearly bolied over. Drink it quick. It's got lots of sugar. Drink it or the sugar is wasted. I don't want it. You drink it. But it's your medicine. If you don't drink it, all that sugar is wasted. Careful. This new machine will break up like bean curd. Shan Shan. Find a good school for Qiang in Guangzhou. Each district has regulations. It's not that easy. If they refuse, we'll offer money. Ah Zhen. You don't ca re about Qiang. I ca re more about Qiang than my own Beannie. - Right? - Why can't we offer more money? You go home. Peasant boys wearing socks? Peasants? Scholars. My son's future is brighter than ours. Our entire lives we looked down. He will look up. Does it look good? Who's in charge? I am. This boy took all the sugar cubes from the table. You said we could have as much as we wanted. Miss Zhang. Miss Zhang, excuse me. The bill is $120. - I only have $20 here. - I haven't asked for the bill yet. But this class leader paid. That's right. I paid. What are you doing? They're overcharging. $20 is already too much. $100 for a few glasses of water. They think we're country bumpkins? Sorry, the boy doesn't understand. I still want to order. And add the sugar to my bill. The sugar lumps don't matter. Here's the money back. Qiang. Don't be scared of them. We'll write to the papers to criticize them. It's too expensive. Line up, quick... time to go to the hostel. I want to go there too. Stay and have a chat. Go. - Why aren't you going? - I have money. Why can't I stay here? What's the matter? Don't mind him. There are drinks in the fridge. I should stay at the hostel. I'm worried about the children. Have a bath and stop moaning. A towel for you. Aren't there any here? I never trust hotel towels. Shampoo. - What's going on? - Nothing. Give me something to wear. My sweater's wet. What are you looking at? Hold the mirror. Once a woman passes thirty, time flies. It's awful being over thirty. You're right. Beannie already comes up to here. Soon, here. I've got wrinkles up to here. Soon, here. What's this ointment? Did Tsong talk to you? Feeling better now? - You put words in his mouth. - No. You're so great. Oh no, I'm not. If I may say so, you should have more self-control. Then things would be easier. No self-control'? You said it yourself, "this wasn't going well, that wasn't..." Did you tell him everything about me? He's only Tsong. Aren't we all close friends? Weren't you two always close friends? Don't get it wrong. I didn't come to be consoled by a man. I depend on no man. I've earned every cent myself. No man picks me. I pick him. What do you mean? That Tsong picked me? Let me tell you, we won the "happy family" award. The brigade awarded us a hot water bottle. So what are you talking about? What? Your life is so boring. You use me as spice. Who's using you? What spice? What have you done to me? I did your make-up. Let's take a picture. What? Losing your temper? No. Then let me take the picture. Wow. Fantastic. Look out, Dolly Parton. Dolly Folly what? I'm no spice either. I'm going to the hostel. I'm not staying here. I'm off. What spice? You're too sensitive. Qiang, what are you looking at? Get on the bus. Quick. The music is so loud. Thirteen more hours on the road. Impossible. It's so noisy. Ask him to turn it off. Comrade, can you turn it down a bit? Can you turn it off? Don't. It's great. We had a good time in Guangzhou. Let's keep having a good time. Qiang. Stop singing, Qiang- Stop singing. Stop singing. Everybody go to sleep. Close your eyes. Ignore him. Can't do anything with him. Hello, Lawyer Cheung. If I sell the business, what do I live on? She's squeezing me for such a small amount? Even a sister is capable of this. For what? To send me to prison? To make me jump off a building? So many people mistreat her, yet she does nothing. She knows I won't harm her so she attacks me. It's goodbye then. Come back often. Hong Kong's so near. Go. Don't worry about us. In another ten years, we'll still be here. Is life monotonous for you? At our age everyday is exciting. Goodbye. Take care. Keep trying. Don't give in. THE 21ST GENERATION Tsong can't see you off. It's warm now so he's planting. I'll send more magazines. The pupils will be very glad. Thank you. Look, the wild geese are returning. It's going to rain. No, it won't. Sweet tangerines, sweet tangerines. You're so busy. It'll probably be ten yea rs before we meet again. I'll come back next year. Take Tsong to Guangzhou for some fun, while you're still young. Or you'll turn into an old hag. When I'm an old hag, you'll be an old hag too. When that day comes, you'll have no worries. The moon makes shifting patterns On the wall and the fence On the bed... On the curtain with the goose embroidery.
