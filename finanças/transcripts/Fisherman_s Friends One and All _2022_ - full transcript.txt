(THE BONNIE SHIP OF THE DIAMOND PLAYING) MAN 1: (SINGING) The Diamond is the ship, me boys For the Davis Straits we're bound And the quay it is all garnished With bonnie lasses 'round Cap'n Thompson gives the orders To sail the ocean wide And we're bound for the land where the sun don't set Or darkness drear the sky CHORUS: And it's cheer up, me lads Let your hearts never fail For the Bonnie Ship The Diamond's gone fishing for the whale Here's a health to the Resolution Likewise, the Eliza Swan Here's a health to the Battler of Montrose And the Diamond, of our fame We wears the trousers of the white The jackets of the blue When we get home to Peter head We'll have sweethearts anew ALL: And it's cheer up, me lads Let your hearts never fail For the Bonnie Ship - (WOMAN WHOOPS) - The Diamond's gone fishing For the whale Hey! - (CROWD CHEERING) - (WOMEN WHOOPING) (WHOOPS) Thank you, Grimsby! (CROWD CONTINUES CHEERING) Thank you. Thank you very much. We are the Fisherman's Friends. - Yes, you are! - MAN: Yes, we are. You'll be relieved to know that fame hasn't changed us. - No. - (CROWD MURMURS) No, we're still very happy to play for common people like you. (CROWD EXCLAIMS) (SCATTERED LAUGHTER) We're going to hand over now to Rowan here, he's the housewife's favourite. (WOMEN CHEER) Apparently, he's got a girl in every port. Yeah, yeah. Don't tell his wife that, mind. Or the only tackle he'll have left is fishing tackle. - (WOMEN CHEERING) - (WOMAN WOLF-WHISTLES) Oh, hello. (MEN JEERING) I told him that blondes would have more fun! - (CLUB MUSIC PLAYING) - (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (ALL LAUGHING) MEN: (CHANTING) Down it! Down it! Down it! Down it! Down it! Down it! Down it! MEN: Aw! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (MAN 2 CHUCKLES) Jim. Hi, um, Gareth Bright well. Uh, A&R, Island Records. Uh, we met at the Cambridge Folk Festival. We did? Yeah, um... Uh, when Leadville's finished with his interview, I was wondering if you could have a word? She is a really influential music journalist. I think I've done enough talking for one night, don't you? (WOMEN CHEERING) Yeah, well, while I've got you, Leah Jordan was just wondering if you'd had any luck finding a replacement singer. Oh. Was she, now? Hmm? No, no, it's just I, um, yeah... We... Well, the "label", um, did notice that, um, the band could... could use an additional tenor. What about... I give you... a tenner to sod off and keep your thoughts to yourself, eh? JOURNALIST: You dirty old man! - (WOMEN CHEER) - How dare you? (MEN EXCLAIMING) Oh, my God! What... - What just happened? - I don't know. She was laughing at all my jokes. I thought I was in there. Leadville, she is literally paid to be nice to you. What did you say? All I said was, does she like meat in her pasty? FISHERMEN'S FRIENDS: (SINGING) For we sail On the sloop John B My grandpappy and me Over the seven seas we did roam -Drinking all night -Drinking all night Got into a fight -Well, I feel so broke up -Oh, yeah I wanna go home -So hoist up the John B's sail -Hoist up the John B's sail -See how the mainsail sets -See how the mainsail sets Call for the captain ashore Let me go home I wanna go home Let me go home -And I wanna go home -Hoist up the John B's sails -Well, I feel so broke up -Oh, yeah I wanna go home -I feel so broke up -Oh, yeah I want to go home Oh, dear God. Look at the sight of them. I've seen dressed crabs look more lively. Oh, at least they're all back safe, Mags. MAGGIE: Apart from my son. Looks like he's been swapped for a stowaway. Nice to see you too, Mother. - Oh, my darling. - (JIM KISSES) - Oh, what? Aw! - Hello, Granfer. - Oh, love, I've missed you. - (MAGGIE CHUCKLES) Oh! What's all this, then? Well, I thought I'd try something different. Hmm. As long as that's the only experimenting you've been doing. What goes on tour stays on tour, Sal. No, don't listen to him. No one's a patch on you, love. JIM: Come on, let's get up the hill. Oh, I swear you've grown over the last couple of weeks. You carry on like this, you're gonna be taller than your mother by the time she gets back. We finally sorted out the time zones last night. - Oh. - We spoke to them. But they're okay. And they're out to the Outback at the end of the week. Oh, well. Mum said she's gonna take some photos of koala bears and other endangered species. Don't know why she had to go halfway around the world to do that. She could have just stayed here and taken pictures of Leadville. (TAMSYN AND MAGGIE CHUCKLE) (SEAGULLS CAWING) Business still on the up, Sal? Oh, booming. Takings are up nearly 25%. Danny must be pleased. Man's sitting on a golden egg! Hmm. What do you think's paying for the honeymoon? (MOBILE PHONE CHIMES) Who's that? Oh, it's... Uh, it's just Jim. Wants me to pick him up some fish bait. No rest for the wicked. Tamsyn seems in good spirits. So would I be if I could still swing my hips like that. (MAGGIE AND JIM CHUCKLING) The fan club's been inundated with people wanting to be the new Fisherman's Friend. No. I don't need any more friends, Mother. Well, that's as may be. But nine's an uneven number. Doesn't sound right, doesn't look right. That's why your father wanted to have ten in the band in the first place. You know my feelings on the matter, Mother. You're not the only one who's hurting, son. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Hi! I was wondering if it might be possible to change to a different room? Well, I'm afraid you've... you've got the best room in the house. You know, superior double with a sea view, as requested. Yes, but I didn't request the flock of seagulls that keep waking me up at five o'clock in the morning. (LAUGHS) General rule of thumb, if you don't like seagulls, don't come to the seaside. General rule of thumb, if you don't like guests, don't run a B&B. Oh, well, I do have a small room at the back, but I'm afraid it doesn't come with a Corby trouser press. I think I can live with a few creases. Oh. That's very big of you. I'll move me things. What are you on, lad? - What? - She's a paying guest! And a rude one. No good morning, no thank you. Who the hell does she think she is? - Miss Flynn! - Hmm. She's viewing properties in the area, apparently. Well, that's all we need, isn't it? Yeah, another second homeowner. If you're looking for someone to blame, you look no further than yourself. - Huh? - It's your songs that have made them want a slice of our lives. (HAUL AWAY JOE PLAYING) JIM: (SINGING) When I was just a little boy Or so my mammy told me Away, haul away We'll haul away, Joe Oh, if I never kissed the girls Me lips would grow a-mouldy Away, haul away We'll haul away, Joe Away! Haul away We'll hope for better weather Away, haul away We'll haul away, Joe I picked him with a Yankee girl JIM: (OVER SPEAKERS) Around the corner, sonny CHORUS: Away, haul away We'll haul away, Joe JIM: Oh, better I stayed than made the grade With the girls from up our alley Away, haul away We'll haul away, Joe - Away! - (TURNS MUSIC OFF) What'd you think? They're just so end of the pier. Are you really telling me that Keane, Mumford & Sons, and Florence and the Machine aren't ready to deliver their new albums? They're artists, Jez, not Stock, Aitken and Waterman. They can't just churn out hits. Whereas, the Fisherman's Friends have a new album just sitting there. And ready to roll. We can plug the hole in quarter four and build on the momentum of their national tour. As president of this label, I have a duty of care to protect its reputation, and... Moby Dick and the Whalers are definitely not on message. Look, I know they're a bit rough around the edges, but it's all part of their old-school charm. Old-school? They're prehistoric, Leah! Nobody tries to shag the female journalist any more. I get it. They're struggling a bit since Danny Anderson hung up his boots. - I'll have a word. - That's not your job. My team can handle it. Fine. Listen. I can just about tolerate them singing songs from 1792 as long as they don't act like they're from the same era. I'll be sure we drag them into the 21st century. (DOOR OPENS) AUTOMATED VOICE: Please record your name and press hash. Leadville Trebilcock. (KEYPAD BEEPS) You will now be placed into the conference. You are the first participant in the conference. (WHIMSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) (GRUNTING SOFTLY) (BREATHES DEEPLY) Come on, man. Think of the ocean. AUTOMATED VOICE: Please record your name and press hash. Oh. (MUTTERS) Jim! (KEYPAD BEEPS) You will now be placed into the conference. You are the tenth participant in the conference. Okay, is everyone on? Yeah. We're, uh... We're still waiting for Leadville, I think. Can we just start without him? Otherwise we'll be here forever. Okay. This is Leah Jordan speaking. Managing Director of Island Records. - We met when you... - (SNIFFS) Ugh! ...gate-crashed my offices in London last year. Yeah. Yeah, I remember. LEAH: I'll cut straight to the chase. The music industry graveyard is littered with one-hit wonders. It's called the curse of the - second album, and it's real. - (BABY COOING) Talking of curses, I am dealing with a poo-nami here. - What? - (BABY CRYING OVER SPEAKER) Um, what? Ugh, I'm sorry, but Cameron's got the runny tummy again. (OVER SPEAKER) Um, you were saying? - What the flip? - Uh... We'd like to release your next album, but we have concerns. Oh, yeah? And what might those be, then? You can't continue acting like social hand grenades. Any negative publicity doesn't just reflect badly on you, it reflects badly on the whole label. With success comes responsibility. Understood. We'll mind our P's and Q's. - (EXHALING) - (URINATING) (URINATING OVER SPEAKER) Huh? Mmm... (CONTINUES URINATING) There she blows. (LEADVILLE WHISTLING DRUNKEN SAILOR OVER SPEAKER) (GASPS) - (WOMAN LAUGHS) - MAN 1: Oh, my God. (CONTINUES URINATING OVER SPEAKER) (LEADVILLE CONTINUES WHISTLING OVER SPEAKER) (URINATING STOPS) (WHISTLING STOPS) Hello. (OVER SPEAKER) Anyone there? JIM: Yeah, we're all here, Leadville. Just waiting for you to flush, mate. (OVER RECORDING) Leadville Trebilcock... AUTOMATED VOICE: ...has left the conference. - (MAN EXCLAIMS) - (LINE BEEPS) JIM: (GRUNTING) I don't think I'm bloody cut out for all of this. JAGO: Cut out for what? All that being in the spotlight lark. (CHUCKLES) End of tour blues is all. Oh, it's not just that. I'm just not sure I wanna be singing any more. I don't think life's got... any easier with all this fuss. No, it's just got more bloody complicated, innit? Why don't you talk to the boys, huh? I'm talking to you, aren't I? (LAUGHING) Don't you go telling too many people. They'll have you in a strait-jacket - before you can say... - "Stargazy pie." "Stargazy pie." (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) Oh, God. Oh, I miss you, Father. (SINGING) No more, I'm through All my little life I've been searching for the door Trying to put my finger on it... Um, you wanted to see me? - Relax. It's not your P45. - (SIGHS IN RELIEF) It's a return ticket on the Stella Express. The, uh, Stella what? The overnight train from Paddington to Penzance. Cornwall? Oh, mate, if it means spending any more time with those men, I honestly think I prefer redundancy. Gareth, you may not be able to grow a beard, but if you're gonna make it in this industry, you are gonna have to grow some balls. Yes, of course. (CHUCKLES) Uh, what is it? Media training. WOMAN: Okay. Well, um, thank you all for being here. Um... Let's start with a volunteer. Um... This is a safe space, who would... who would like to go first? Maybe share any... Anything. Okay. My name IS Leadville Trebilcock. And I'm politically incorrect. Right, welcome, Lead... Leadville. (SCATTERED APPLAUSE) Now, admitting you have a problem is the first and most important step in your journey of recovery. Let's explore the incident you had with a female journalist in Grimsby. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Well, to be perfectly honest, I'd had a few jars, so I can't actually remember what happened, my darlin'. Oh, can I just stop you there? Uh, referring to me, or indeed, any woman as "my darling" is inappropriate. But it's just a term of affection, innit? It's also a term that represents centuries of male oppression. How about "my fair maid'? Why would you assume that because I'm a woman I must be a domestic servant? No, no, no, no. He... He means "maid" as in "maiden". You know? Well, that's even worse. You don't know if I'm married or if I've ever had sexual intercourse. (MEN CLEAR THROAT) So, how should we address you? Why don't you try using... using my name? All right, Pet... ra. Can I... Should... Should we... Should we get back to basics? Yeah. Yeah, okay. Um... Let's try some neurolinguistic programming. Update the way you speak and think. Nope. Bugger this. - PETRA: Um... - Ooh, no. - Jim, where are you going? - I have got pots that need pulling. And, no, that is not a euphemism. (MEN CHUCKLE) Um, yeah. Jim, so... Sorry. Jim? Just a quick word? PETRA: Um, everyone, if we all just shut our eyes for a second and just stroke the top of your forehead. A little bit. Just take that tension out. Everyone. Okay, brilliant. JIM: Well, what did they expect, eh? (STUTTERS) When they signed ten proud singing fishermen? (SCOFFS) We speak this way 'cause we're Cornish. Not 'cause we're part of some patriarchal conspiracy. (DOORBELL RINGS) I'll get it! JIM: Right, my love! Thank you. (SCOFFING) And now they want to stop us using local terms of endearment and all. If I ever do that, I may as well stop eating pasties, drinking Tribute, and waving the flag of St Piran. Yeah, I know what you mean, son, but... (CHUCKLES) A little awareness of what other people might find offensive is... (TUTS) Well, it can't do no harm, can it? Hmm, well... What? Well, I know that we all have our signature crimping style, but... it's a crime not to brush our pastry with egg wash. That's 'cause I ain't finished yet, have 1? There's a music journalist at the door. Why can they not just respect my bloody privacy, eh? He doesn't want to speak to you, Granfer. He wants to speak to Aubrey Flynn. Huh? (SEAGULLS CAWING) - (JIM SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) - Thank you. Is it only me that finds it ironic? That I'm paying you for selling me out. I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean. If you wanted a celebrity endorsement, you could've just asked me for a signed photograph, and stuck that up on your wall. Oh, I'm very sorry, miss. (STUTTERS) We haven't got the faintest idea who you are. ROWAN: She's an Irish singer. She had a couple of hits in the late '90s. - Oh, is that right, is it? - ROWAN: Yeah. Yeah, Sal and I, we danced to one of them at our wedding. Oh, to be honest, I don't remember much out of my best man's speech. Yeah, probably for the best. Cousin Pascoe's wife's brother-in-law's auntie's daughter... - What? Morwenna? - That's the one. She says she's been asking about properties to rent. Oh, yeah? Probably to get away from prying eyes. I did a bit of Go ogling. She got a reputation as being a bit of a hell raiser. Makes Stevie Nicks - look like Shirley Temple. - Oh. Huh. She's not the only one. (PLEASANT MUSIC PLAYING) (MEN VOCALISING) Right. Tony. Come in here, my dear. Just go in there, sit down anywhere you like. Could put a glass eye to sleep, that one. Granfer! Have you seen the queue? - (ALL VOCALISING INDISTINCTLY) - (SINGING) White stockings White stockings, she wore We've got nearly a hundred hopefuls. - Oh. - But don't worry, my son. No one's gonna be stepping in anyone's shoes. Good. 'Cause they're too big to fill. - This just doesn't feel right. - Huh? (ALL CONTINUE SINGING INDISTINCTLY) Why's there no women auditioning? Leadville, I think the clue is in the name. "Fisherman"? We don't wanna be accused of sexual discrimination. Eh? Ever since our media training, he thinks he's become a feminist, see? (LAUGHS) Word of advice, my darling. You gotta be able to fill a bra before you can burn one. Come on. Let's get this over with. Right! Let's be having you. Hello. What are you going to sing for us today? Sailing. Rod the Mod's had a bit of a makeover. (SINGING) I am sailing I am sailing! GARETH: Ooh. Home again! Across the sea I am sailing (SOFTLY) Wailing, more like. (SINGING) Crying cockles and mussels alive, alive, oh! Alive, alive-o! Alive, alive-o! Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-o! (SINGING) In the Navy, come on Protect the Motherland In the Navy, come on now Join your fellow man! In the Navy Come on, girls Give yourself a hand! In the Navy I said, they want you They want you They want you as a new recruit They want you! They want you! They want you as a new recruit! - No, we bloody don't. - (SNICKERS) (SINGING) For... -I am a pirate king -(MOUTHING ALONG) Hurrah for the pirate king And it is, it is a glorious thing -To be a pirate king -(SINGING ALONG) I am the pirate king! - (CLEARS THROAT) - And it is, it is A glorious thing to be a pirate king Hurrah for the pirate king! Hurrah for the pirate King! - I think he should abdicate. - (CHUCKLES) All right, uh, my name is, uh, Morgan Jenkins. Well, that's a lovely lilt you've got there, Morgan. Where you come from? West Wales, a small town called Llangrannog. Try saying that when you're pissed. Try saying it when you're sober. (MEN LAUGH) What will you be singing for us today, Mr Jenkins? Well, a song that I know you all know. Uh, it's a favourite shanty of mine. Santiana. (LAUGHS) In your own time, me 'and some. (SINGING) O! Santiana won the day Heave away, Santiana He won the day down in Monte Del Rey All along the plains of Mexico Heave her up and away we'll go Heave away, Santiana (SINGING) Heave her up and away we'll go All along the plains of Mexico Oh, Santiana fought for gold Heave away, Santiana What deeds he did have oft been told All along the plains of Mexico Heave her up and away we'll go -Heave away, Santiana -(ALL SINGING ALONG) Heave her up and away we'll go All along the plains of Mexico Where's that golden button? (CHUCKLES) Buzzer. Ah. Golden buzzer, Mother. (IN CORNISH) (EXCLAIMS IN CORNISH) (IN ENGLISH) You speak Cornish? When I moved down, I thought I'd pick up a dictionary and learn a word or two. Well, it looks like you've done a lot more than that. Well, to be fair, Cornish is a close cousin to my mother tongue, So, it's probably the reason why I feel so at home here. Would you be able to take time off work to fulfil touring, recording, and promotional activities? You bet I would. (CHUCKLES) Absolutely, yeah! I'm my own boss. (RINGING TONE) (MOBILE PHONE RINGING) - Ooh! - (MOBILE PHONE BEEPS) Hi, Leah. Gareth, where've you been? Just doing some work. Yeah. On the harbour wall getting some, um, service. Uh, right. Look. I've watched Morgan's audition. He seems the perfect fit. Great! Okay, great, yeah! I'll let them know. (CHUCKLES) Oh, Christ. What? The tide. (LINE DISCONNECTS) (LAUGHS) Shit. Well, one thing to sing for us all in a church. WOMAN: You all right? Quite another to sing for a bunch of rowdy fans out on the Platt. Didn't look like the sort who would get stage fright. No. My feeling is that the man is going to be out of his depth. ROWAN: He's not the only one. - Eh? - (LAUGHING) Have a look at this. JIM: What's up? (MEN LAUGHING) (EXHALING SHARPLY) Oi! Gareth! Huh? Ah. Shark! (PEOPLE LAUGHING) Good one! Leah Jordan absolutely loved Morgan's audition clip. She thinks he'll be a real asset to the band. Oh, well, she does, does she? She also said Kenny's Seafood have been in touch. They were just wondering if you'd be interested in being the face of their new fish product. They Cornish fish, are they? (LAUGHS) What? I didn't realise fish had nationalities. Of course they do. How can you tell? They have Cornish accents, innum? (MEN SNICKER AND LAUGH) Oh, give him a chance, he's such fun! Sorry. Yeah, the label thought it would be a good marketing opportunity to sort of cross-publicise with the album launch. Any money in it for us? Yeah, a couple of thousand each. What do we have to do for it? Uh, Leah said something about dressing up as fishmongers. Oh. No. (FOLK MUSIC PLAYING) FISHERMAN'S FRIENDS: (SINGING) You will have a fishy On a little dishy You will have a fishy when the boat comes in You will have a fishy on a little dishy You will have a fishy when the boat comes in Dance to your daddy Sing to your mommy Dance to your daddy My bonnie lad Dance to your daddy Sing to your mommy Dance to your daddy My bonnie lad You will have a fish You will have a fin You will have a mackerel When the boat comes in (OVER SPEAKERS) You will have a fish You will have a fin You will have a mackerel when the boat comes in I'm losing it! I'm losing it! I'm losing it! Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi! - Cut! Cut! - (MAN CHUCKLES) - (MEN EXCLAIM) - Come on, what's going on? GARETH: It's all right. I've got it. MORGAN: Horsey, whoa! (LAUGHS) This is bloody ridiculous! How you supposed to serve fish dressed like this? Yeah, sorry, lads, I must have misheard the creative brief. Well, there is a world of difference, isn't there, between a fishmonger and a fish finger? What the bloody hell are you doing here, anyway? He isn't even officially a part of the band yet. (STUTTERS) Leah thought he might add some sex appeal. And since when a fish finger's been sexy? (GROUP LAUGHS) LEADVILLE: Yeah. GARETH: Sorry, mm... MORGAN: Look at him... You never were the sharpest tool in the shed, but I didn't think you'd be this dumb! - What are you talking about? - You don't realise you left your phone in the pub? Yeah. This popped up from some slapper in Grimsby flashing her assets wanting to pick up where you left off. No, no, it was just a hen-do. Oh, yeah, and what were you? One more fling before the ring? No, nothing happened, Sal, I promise. Don't bother coming home tonight. You're barred. Sal? Sal! - The ring, don't kick it. - LEADVILLE: Over there! - The flipper. - Sal! - Flip it on the flipper. - I can't! (LEADVILLE, ROWAN AND MORGAN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) Um, the director would like to do one more take. If he hasn't got it after 25, then perhaps he should get a different job, eh? Yeah, um, okay. Well, there's quite a lot at stake here, Jim. Yeah. Yeah, there is. Families, and friendship. And none of this is helping. ROWAN: Put it on the thing. Put it on the flipper. - I'll get it. I'll get it. - Get your flipper away! (ROWAN, LEADVILLE AND MORGAN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) ROWAN: Get your flipper out of the way. (MEN ARGUING) Right, okay, um... Well, enjoy the view, Miss Flynn. This is one of our most popular rentals. Cheers. What? Oh, God! Sorry. (GROANS) Oh, The Folly, eh? Oh, gonna be right up your street, ain't it? I'm sorry? Oh, yeah, hasn't he told you? The place was built as a den of debauchery some 200 years ago, so... So? Drinking, orgies, opium... That was just the tea parties, so... I don't know what you're getting at. Don't listen to him, Miss Flynn. It's all just old wives' tales. Oh, he'll say anything for a sale, he will. Oh, I don't know how you sleep at night, Logan. Pricing locals out of the housing market and whatnot? Hey, I have known you since you were a lad. Where is your integrity? Integrity, eh? Well, you are a fine one to talk. BOY: Excuse me? Can I have your autograph, please? (SIGHS) Yes, but you should be asking her for hers, 'cause she's the famous one around here. Apparently. It was a mutiny! There was nothing I could do! They're a bunch of ageing fisherman, not Pirates of the Caribbean. (SCOFFS) Yeah, well, okay. Give me Blackbeard any day. No, I can't do this any more, Leah! I literally cannot function outside the M25! Oh, stop being such a melt. How hard can it be? (LINE DISCONNECTS) Gareth? Hello? (SIGHS) I only agreed to this because you said you were personally going to take charge. I thought he could handle it. Time to pack your bucket and spade. (SIGHS) (LEADVILLE SNORING) Ugh! Will you get your cloven hoof out of my face! You can talk! Hogging the duvet all night. I'm surprised you need one with all that bloody hot air you've been leaking. At least I didn't try to spoon you. (SIGHS) I thought I was back in bed with Sal. (SAIL AWAY LADIES PLAYING) Ain't no use to sit and cry Sail away, lady, sail away You'll be an angel by and by Sail away, lady, sail away Don't you rock Don't you rock on Don't you rock on, my daddy Don't you rock on, daddy-oh (FOLK MUSIC PLAYING) Afternoon, Jim. Maggie said I'd find you here. Oh, hello. Head of the record label risking getting her shoes dirty? Must be important. Playing the Minack Theatre in front of the national press is about as important as it gets. What? You got us a booking at the Minack? Oh. Proper job. I'm here to make sure you're all on message for the press junket. Yeah? Whose message might that be, then? Yours or ours? Same thing, Jim. You ever done a junket before? No. Well, all you gotta do is grip and grin. Sounds like a prostate examination. Similar. Only more probing. JOURNALIST: Tom Roberts. What's it like sharing a record label with Lady Gaga? Well, according to our management, she's well chuffed. (ALL LAUGH) David White, BBC Radio Cornwall. Now, lots of people say that - you're just a novelty act. - Oh? But it looks like you're here to stay, so, what's the secret ingredient? Musical integrity. Oggy, oggy, oggy! GROUP: (CHANTS) Oi, I, oi! ROWAN: Oggy! GROUP: Oi! - Oggy! - GROUP: Oi! ROWAN: Oggy, oggy, oggy! GROUP: (CHANTS) Oi, oi, oi! Karthi Gnanasegaram. What's it like to welcome a new member to the band? Morgan Jenkins, like us, is a proud Celt with a fine voice who also risks his life volunteering for the RNLI. Are you a fisherman by trade, too, Mr Jenkins? Uh, no. I'm a farmer. (GAGS AND SPUTTERS) - (SOFTLY) Christ, here we go. - (PEOPLE CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) Not now, Jimmy. - What? Did you know? - I thought everybody did. Grip and grin, Jim. Um, that's enough questions. - Thank you. - (EXCITED CHATTER CONTINUES) If you could just make your way to the theatre, you can take your seats. ANNOUNCER: (OVER SPEAKERS) This evening's performance by the Fisherman's Friends will begin in approximately 15 minutes. Will you please take your seats? MAGGIE: Come on, son. Get over yourself. Look where you are. You're singing in one of the best venues in the country. Well, I am as open-minded as the next man, Mother, as you well know. But you've gotta draw a line in the sand somewhere, ain't you? Bad enough being told what we can and can't catch out there but blokes like him, he's been given subsidies not to farm. Right now, Father would be spinning in his grave. No, son. You are wrong there. Jago was a man of the people. Some of his oldest friends worked the land. (GRUMBLES) And you can pack that whisky in, and all. I... I have had it way up to here with your fussing! ALL: She sells seashells on the seashore. The shells she sells are surely... He sells seashells! "She", Leadville. It's not "he". That's the sort of gender stereotyping that's fuel led centuries of female oppression. (MEN LAUGH) Why should we assume it's a woman peddling her wares? Cheers. - What's that say? - Uh, it's a song list. No, no, this. Him opening with Little Lize? That ain't happening. - Why not? - 'Cause it ain't! The audience like it, and Morgan knows it. Yeah, the boys thought it'd be a good idea to start with something upbeat. Put a smile on people's faces. Oh, I ain't smiling, am I? No, if there's gonna be any changes, it's gotta be put to a vote, ain't it? We already voted, Jim. But you decided that getting another drink was more important than having a say. Little Lize was the first song my father ever taught me. Now lose it. - (EXHALES) - MORGAN: What was that about? (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING) Hey, alright? We're Port Isaac's Fisherman's Friends. If the salty smell of the sea has been overpowered by the... by the rotten stench of manure, well, that's because the band have asked a muck-spreader to join us here today. Steady on, Jim. Our first song is A Sailor ain't a Sailor. And ladies and gentlemen, please give a hearty welcome to our newest member of the band, Morgan Jenkins. - (ALL APPLAUDING AND CHEERING) - (WHOOPS) (SINGING) My father often told me When I was just a lad - (FINGERS SNAP) - The Sailor's life Is very hard The food was always bad But now I've joined the Navy aboard a Man-o-war And now I find a sailor ain't a sailor any more ALL: Don't haul on the ropes Don't climb up the mast If you see a sailing ship It might be your last (ALL EXCLAIM) Get your civvies ready for another run ashore A sailor ain't a sailor Ain't a sailor any more The killick of our mess -He says we've had it soft -(FINGERS SNAP) It wasn't like this in his day When he was up aloft We like our bunks and sleeping bags But what's a hammock for? Swinging from the deck head Or lying on the floor? ALL: Don't haul on the ropes Don't climb up the mast If you see a sailing ship, it might be your last (MEN EXCLAIM) Get your civvies ready for another run ashore A sailor ain't a sailor Ain't a sailor any more Don't haul on the ropes Don't climb up the mast If you see a sailing ship, it might be your last Get your civvies ready for another run ashore A sailor ain't a sailor Ain't a sailor any more (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING AND CHEERING) Ah. Thank you. Thank you. There we are, our nine Fisherman's Friends - and one sheep shagger! - (AUDIENCE BOOS) MAN 1: Get on with it. WOMAN 1: Come on. Ladies and gentlemen, our next song is Drunken Sailor! Oh, go and put a sock in it Germaine Greer, I'm gonna decide what we sing next. (AUDIENCE BOOING) - Here we go, lads. - MAN 1: Get on with it! MAN 2: Come on! (AUDIENCE JEERING) WOMAN 2: I want a refund! WOMAN: (ON RECORDING) I am strong. I can make a difference. I am strong. I can make a difference. WOMAN: Today I will succeed. Today I will succeed. WOMAN: You are not a victim. Hey! Hi. Uh... Um, sorry. Just, um... WOMAN: You are not a victim. Just going through new artist submissions. Mindfulness tapes, a growing market. Huge. WOMAN: You are not a victim. (SHUSHES) That's better. I'm trying to make contact with Leah. Any update from Cornwall? Uh, well, no news is good news, Jez... Boss. Jim! Jim? Jim, you're ruining this for everyone! - Jim! Come on! - Get off of me! Come on, Jim! What happened to "one and all"? One and all, my arse! Ever since we made the top ten, it's been every bugger for himself around here! Why don't you just take it easy, Jim? If you've got a problem with me, we can take it somewhere else. Oh, sod that! Let's have it out right here, shall we? Eh? All right, back off! Hey, if you touch me one more time, I'm gonna punch you so bloody hard, you're gonna be spittin' teeth for a bloody week! - Jim! - Yeah, what do you want? What the hell is going on? Well, why don't you ask him? - You need to calm down! - Oh, yeah! Take a time out, you're back on in ten minutes. No. I'm not going on anywhere. I've had enough of this crap. No, I quit! LEAH: Jim. Jim! (ROWAN SIGHS) ROWAN: Any sign of him? (SIGHS) Looked everywhere. See, this wouldn't have happened if I hadn't have joined the band. Don't be daft, Morgan. If anybody's to blame, it's Jim. I'm sorry, I know he's going through a tough time right now, but he's not the only one struggling. Not as simple as that, Rowan. You know that. Look, this doesn't sit right with me. You lot have been friends since you were in short trousers. And me being here is gonna get in the way of you boys patching things up, so... I reckon I should just leave you to it. - No, Morgan. - No. - Come on, man. - Listen, listen. I've had the best time singing with you boys. But this is bigger than that. (SEAGULL CAWING) (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) You made a right fool of yourself out there. Oh, the whole bloody situation has made bloody fools out of everyone, ain't it? All I want is for things to go back to how they were before. Change is inevitable, boy. And in my experience, it often brings something good if you embrace it. Ain't nothing good coming out of this for anyone. No, far as I can see, they're all just blinded by the bloody lights, that's all. What? 'Tis so much better sitting by yourself in the dark. Well, better that than being surrounded by people... and feeling lonelier than you ever have before. Leadville? Come on, wake up! Wake up, you lazy so and so. Morning, Maggie. You made the papers. On a scale of one to ten, how bad is it? Eleven. "Fisherman's Friends leave a sour taste." "Shanty band sink to new depths." "Cornish crooners walk the plank." "Fans left gutted.” What'd The Daily Mail say? (SIGHS) "Hook, line and stinker." No wonder Jim's laying low. The least he could do is look us all in the eye and say sorry. Well, I have never seen him so down. I don't know what to do to get through to him any more. JIM: (SINGING) Pass around the grog, me boys Never mind the storm Drink the good old liquor down Until we call for more Sing, sing... (AUBREY PANTING) Well, that was steeper than it looked on the map. Yeah. Yeah. - But worth it for this view. - Yeah. Yeah, it is. That was some performance you did yesterday. Well, isn't that what lead singers are meant to do? Put on a show, create a bit of a scandal. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) I've definitely done some crazy things in my time, too. - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Not quite the full Ozzy Osbourne biting the head off a bat or anything, but... Definitely stuff I regret. Well, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm up here 'cause I want to be alone. Mm-hmm. I get that. Cheers. Hey? If you ever wanna chat with somebody, you know where I'm staying. JIM: (ON VIDEO) Well, we're nine Fisherman's Friends and one sheep shagger. LEADVILLE: And our next song is Drunken Sailor! JIM: Put a bloody sock in it, will you, Germaine Greer? JEZ: Seriously? JIM: I'm gonna decide what we sing next. (SIGHS) Yeah, Leah? It's Jez. Time to cut them loose. LEAH: There's no easy way to say this. The president of the label has decided to drop the band. (SIGHS) What about the album? We can't release something we don't represent. There must be something you can do. These are hands, Rowan, not magic wands. So that's it, then? Our day in the sun is over? Some bands don't even get there. This isn't just any old album, Leah, you know. Jago sings on a couple of the tracks, it's dedicated to his memory. I'm sensitive to the situation, Maggie. But for the label, it's strictly business. Well, it might be business to you, my dear, but it's personal to me. Jago has a chance to live on through song. I'm sorry, Maggie. I really am. But this comes from the top. There's nothing I can do. (FOLK MUSIC PLAYING) FISHERMAN'S FRIENDS: (SINGING) Stormy's only got one eye Blow, Captain Stormio He'll always find you by and by Blow, Captain Stormio Stormy's roarin' round the bay Stamp and go and heave away Stormy's here but he can't stay Sailors stay in port today Stormy's watchin' with his eye Let him pass and blow on by He's a-lookin' at you from the sky Blow, Captain Stormio Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide Blow, Captain Stormio Stormy's watchin' with his eye Let him pass and blow on by Let him pass and blow on by Let him pass and blow on by (BIRDS SQUAWKING) WOMAN: Fame is a fickle thing that can vanish in the blink of an eye. Something that notorious Irish singer Aubrey Flynn found out when she had a major meltdown and turned on her fans. Maybe you can blame a failed album and the pressures of a national tour, but throw in plenty of alcohol, live TV and you've got a recipe for disaster. AUBREY: I don't care! - MAN: Boo! - Up yours! (CROWD SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) AUBREY: Kiss my arse! MAN: Boo! - (CROWD SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) - Get me out of here! (AUBREY PLAYING GUITAR) AUBREY: (SINGING) Sorry for everything There's a hundred roads That I've already travelled Got a story, ooh... (HUMMING) (SHE CONTINUES PLAYING GUITAR) Baby, got to write An ending No! (MUMBLING) Are you lost? - Eh? - Are you lost? No! No, I was just checking the condition of the stiles and fences along the coastal path. Must be a love-hate relationship. What's that? You and farmers? Oh, no, no. Enough of them buggers. No, no, no. It was for the lifeboat service. More work for them if someone takes a tumble down a cliff, that's all. Mm. While you're up here, do you fancy a cuppa? (HESITATES) Yeah. Yeah, all right. (STUTTERS) I don't suppose you got anything stronger, have you? I could add an extra tea bag. Huh. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (JIM SIGHS) Oh, thank you. (STUTTERS) Now that I'm up here, um... I'd like to apologise for... for being grouchy with you since you arrived in town. I've not been feeling myself of late. I appreciate that. I've... I've been told you... you've packed in the drinking, is that right? I haven't had a drink in 1,047 days. - Mm. Yeah. Yeah. - Ah. (CHUCKLES) Sounds repetitive. Each one's a victory. Yeah, I like a... pint or two myself, I can stop whenever I like. I used to say that. And then I realised I'd rather live my life sober and consider myself an alcoholic than live my life drunk and try and convince myself that I'm not. Yeah. (SNIFFS) AUBREY: I can't ever imagine getting tired of this view. JIM: Yeah. Sometimes she's got a nasty habit of letting you know how insignificant you are. I don't need reminding of that. Hm. You feel it even more when you're out there, mind. I tell you what... I'll let you know next time I'm going out. Maybe tag along? If you fancy. Hm. (GROANS) What have you done to your hair? You look like Kermit the Frog! Trying to get back to my natural colour. Where's your bloody washing machine? We haven't got one. If you wanna wash your grundies, you're gonna have to do it the old-fashioned way. Hot water, soap, plenty of elbow grease. (SIGHS) You'll have to wash the dishes first, mind. (ROWAN SIGHS) Right. I'm off to liberate a brown trout. - (SIGHS) - (PHONE RINGING) - Rowan speaking. - It's me. Is everything all right? Is Kenwyn okay? He's fine. I spoke to that girl from Grimsby. She said she took advantage of you being so hammered and hassled you into giving her your number. I'm so, so sorry, Sal. I've been a right fool. But... (SIGHS) Listen, if we're gonna get past this then I need to be totally honest with you, all right? I kind of enjoyed the attention. Made me feel wanted again. What do you mean "wanted"? Since we've had Kenwyn, you've barely looked my way or laid a finger on me. It's not that I don't want you any more. It's just... I don't have any time to be me. I'm either a mom or a landlady or a housewife. None of those things make me feel very attractive. Got ourselves into a right muddle, didn't we? - (CHUCKLES) - I swear on Kenwyn's life that I will never look at another woman ever again. (SCOFFS) Fat lot of good you're gonna be behind the bar. Ker-ching! (HUMMING) What are you so cock-a-hoop about? Sally's taking me back. Thank God for that. So if it took Mum and Danny 23 hours to fly to Sydney... - JIM: Yeah? - ...how long would it have taken great-great-great- great-Uncle Jack to sail there? Hm, four months he was at sea. Along with some of the best tenors in the county. All lookin' to make their fortunes in the great copper mines of South Australia, they were. - Did he become rich? - Uh, no. No, but he did find happiness. Yeah. He found and married his true love out there, he did. Aw. As it happens, turns out she were born in Padstow. (CHUCKLING) A man can't have it all though, can he, eh? Can we go and visit the old tin mine you used to work near here? Yeah, maybe next week. But I wanna get on with my school history project on it. Yeah, well, I'm a bit busy this week, Tam. Monday, after school. Make that a date, eh? I've got to get this lot off, so I'll see you later, my darlin'. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (ENGINE STARTS) (PLEASANT MUSIC PLAYING) (SEAGULLS CAWING) I can see why you like it out here. Away from everyone. All I ever wanted to be was a fisherman. Like my father. He used to say, "If you can find a job you love, son, "you won't have to do "a hard day's work in your life." Wise words. I suppose you were born with sea legs. No! (CHUCKLING) No, no, no, far from it. No. I suffered from seasickness so badly when I was a lad, the others used to call me Jonah. - Jonah? - As in Jonah and the Whale. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Someone who's bad luck. Yeah. Clergymen and redheads. Also unwelcome on board. As are women, but I expect that's for a different reason. I'm honoured you've taken the risk. You should be. So, how'd you get over it? Well, my father was a stubborn bastard, that's how. (CHUCKLING) He'd have me out here every day, no matter the weather. No matter how often he had to hose the deck down. He tried all the old wives' tales on me, he did. Had me sitting on a brown paper bag, chewing ginger, dabbing fresh water behind my ears. None of it worked, mind, no. No, the only real cure for seasickness is to go and sit under a tree. (LAUGHS) Yeah. No, eventually, yeah, I expect my body just adapted, that's all. It's amazing what we can overcome once we put our minds to it. Hm. Yeah. We should press on, we, uh... We've still got ten string of pods to pull before we head back in. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) She's like a siren... luring him onto the rocks. What's a siren? Similar to a mermaid, only more dangerous. JIM: You have chosen your eight songs? AUBREY: Mm-hmm. JIM: You've got your luxury item, you've got your book. AUBREY: Yep. JIM: Now, if you gotta choose one of those songs, Aubrey Flynn... They always do that, don't they? - Uh, yeah. (LAUGHS) - They always throw in a name. Which one's it gonna be? AUBREY: Can I phone a friend? JIM: No, this is not Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? - This is Desert Island Discs. - (AUBREY LAUGHING) JIM: Which one are you gonna choose? AUBREY: Final answer? JIM: Yeah, final answer. AUBREY: Fleet wood Mac, Landslide. JIM: Fleet wood Mac, Landslide it is. Thank you very, very much for joining us. - (JIM HUMMING) - (AUBREY LAUGHING) JIM: How was that? Was that all right? - That was delicious. - Good. It's been a long time since I've had the luxury of actually cooking for someone. It's been a long time since I've been cooked for. JIM: Hm. Well, I noticed you've got your guitar here. Mm-hmm. Does that mean you've been working on something? Yeah. Yeah, always. - Go. Go on, then. - No. Oh, no, no. No, no. - I couldn't. - Go on. I only sing for myself these days. All right. All right, what if I hide behind that chair and then you can pretend I'm not here? (LAUGHING) No. Go on. A verse. All right, just a chorus. - I'm too shy. - Four bars. - Two bars. First line. - Sold. Since you asked so beautifully. (AUBREY CLEARS THROAT) (SINGING) There's a hundred roads That I've already travelled Got a story for every day of the year But, baby, gotta write us an ending To stop my heart from hearing words I cannot bear Babe, I gotta let you go We both know it We know Maybe I'm a complicated soul But I can't say that I don't wanna see you again Ooh, babe, I gotta let you go We both know it, yeah We know - That's as far as I go. - That was beautiful. Thank you. JIM: Wow. What's it all about, now, that one? (INHALES) - My divorce. - Oh. That's a bloody eloquent response, if I may say so. (CHUCKLES) My marriage ended... and best I could come up with was a string of four-letter expletives, so... I've said my fair share of those, too. Yeah, I'm sure. The first I found out about my husband's affair... was when the tabloids turned up on my doorstep with photographs. - Oh, Christ. - Looking for comment. What about you? Oh, no. You don't wanna hear about all that. Oh, I have aired my dirty laundry. Fair is fair. Oh, yeah, well, it was a, uh... It was a lee shore wind that first exposed my wife's infidelity. We'd been called out to a stricken yacht that had run aground, was taking on water. When we got there, I found the captain was bailing the water out with his first mate... (SMACKS LIPS) ...who happened to be my wife. Wow. Seriously? Yeah, it turns out they'd been having an affair for a couple of years. Wow. And old muggins here... (CHUCKLES) Thought she'd taken up sea rowing. - (BOTH CHUCKLE) - Oh, yeah. What did you say to her? Well, let's just say the trip back to the port was something of a choppy venture. - (BOTH LAUGH) - I bet it was. At least you can laugh about it now. Yeah. Yeah, that seems to be coming a little easier, the more time I spend with you. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) LEADVILLE: Don't know why we couldn't have just driven. MAGGIE: We mustn't give them any warning. It's all about the element of surprise. Lord knows what's going on up there. How are you so sure he's up there, anyway? Call it mother's instinct. (SEAGULLS CAWING) But he's a grown man. If he's decided to take a walk on the wild side, what can we do about it? Stage an intervention. I lost one man I love, I'm not gonna lose another. Certainly not to drink and drugs. - These look lovely. - Yeah. JIM: Here, hold up. Now, this could be the end of a beautiful friendship. What could? Ah. There are two types of people in this world. There are those who put their jam on first... and then those poor lost souls who reach for the cream. There are rules for eating scones? Ones we live and die by. See, if you are unfortunate enough to be born in Devon, then you put the cream on first. AUBREY: Hm. But on this side of the border, we like to do things properly, see? Big dollop of cream on the jam. AUBREY: Hm. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - You first. - All right. (GASPS) - Oh, my God! - (LAUGHS) I can't believe you've just done that. (LAUGHING) So, would you like me to lick the cream off first? Or the jam? (STUTTERS) I don't think we've got a rule for that. (LAUGHS) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Oh! Hello. Is my son in there? Oh, my God! What has she done to you, son? Oh. What you lot doing up here, then? It's all right, Jim. We're here to help. - Help with what? - I told you he was in denial. What are you banging on about? There's no easy way to say this, Jim, but we've come to take you to rehab. Rehab? What? (SCOFFS) (LAUGHS) Jim hasn't had a drink in a week. Well, I knew she'd say that. That's what they always do, innit? Addicts. Cover up for each other. I've been sober for almost three years. You have? Oh. JIM: Yeah, she's been helping me out of the muddle I got myself into. And thanks to her, the black cloud is starting to lift. See? Does that mean you'll be joining the band again? No. No, Rowan, no. When father died, the band died with him. But together it's up to us to keep them both alive! - I'll leave you guys to it. - JIM: Yeah. All right. I've spoken to Leah Jordan. If we can come up with a memorable marketing angle, we are in with a gambler's chance of the label taking us back! Oh, well. Good luck with that, eh, Mother. Tell you what, you give me a call when you've booked us a nice slot on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury. Right? I'm teaching her how to bake a scone. I'll see you later, all right? BOTH: Scone? Sorry about that. They care. That's nothing to apologise for. Hm. (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) JEZ AND FEMALE SINGER: (SINGING) I want my love back It's over, that is that -This is the final act -(JEZ LAUGHS) I want my love back I want my love back Ah. This has got number one written all over it. (BOTH MOUTHING) Just wait until we get her on the chat shows. You're not seriously gonna let her speak? She's fun. She's thick. Success is measured in record sales, Leah, not brain cells. Jez, she thought Rio Ferdinand was the capital of Brazil. - Uh... - (DOOR OPENS) Hello! Um, I've got Maggie on the phone. (INHALES SHARPLY) Mad Maggie? From Cornwall. Do you want me to tell her you're busy? Uh, no. No. I'll take it. - Thanks. - (MOUTHING) Maggie, what can I do for you? Hello, Leah. I got one word to say to you. Glastonbury. Uh, what about it? Would the label take the boys back if they sang there this year? (LEAH LAUGHS OVER SPEAKER) Maggie, Glastonbury is the biggest music festival in the world. Every A-list artist dreams of performing there. Only a handful get to realise that dream. Well, that's probably because they don't have the special connection we have. LEAH: What connection? Joseph of Arimathea. Joseph who? You know, Jesus's uncle, the tinner. He sailed from Galilee to Saint Michael's Mount to buy tin, and he brought Jesus with him. (LAUGHS) The Son of God came to Penzance? We are the chosen people, Leah. (LAUGHS) You may laugh, my dear... (CHUCKLING) But where'd you think we got the saffron from for the saffron buns? Maggie, you're losing me here. What has any of this got to do with Glastonbury? Well, before they went home, Jesus and Joseph stopped off in the Men dip Hills to buy lead. And Uncle Joseph planted his staff on the mount above Glastonbury, which grew into the famous Glastonbury Thorn, which blooms every year at Christmas. You know, the one the Queen has a sprig of on her breakfast table before she gives the corgis their sherry? Sounds like you're the one who's been on the sherry, Maggie. It's true. William Blake wrote about it in the song Jerusalem. (SINGING) And did those feet in ancient time Walk upon England's mountains green Uh... (SIGHS) Look, um, Maggie, even if this holy connection paid off, you don't have a lead singer. Well, if you're talking about Jim, he's had a change of heart. We're all one big happy family again. - We are? - You are? He's always wanted to play Glastonbury. Ever since Jago took him there in 1982 to see Van Morrison. Okay, but what about the beef between him and Morgan? Wouldn't it be a wonderful way to celebrate them all getting back together again? Okay, yeah. Keep me posted and if anything comes of it, I'll take it to my boss. Okay? Good. Thank you, take care. And good luck! (LAUGHS) That woman has seriously lost the plot. - Yeah. A tinner? - (LAUGHS) MAGGIE: Come on, let's have a look. - ROWAN: There you are. - Oh, hello, my darlings. Off you go. ROWAN: Thank you. MAGGIE: Oh. Here. Michael and Emily Eavis, Worthy Farm, Glastonbury. That's the one. I hate to be a naysayer, Maggie, but how do you know Michael Eavis even likes lobster? Well, it's just a little sweetener, you know, while he listens to the album and reads my letter reminding him of our holy connection. If we manage to pull this off, it'll be up there with changing water into wine. (ALL LAUGHING) Come on, my darling. Let's go for that walk on the headland. Well, have fun. We'll see you later at lunchtime. TAMSYN: Will do. AUBREY: As much as I love having you to myself, you can't stay up here hiding away from the world forever. JIM: No, the trouble is I'm not sure the world is the same without my father in it. AUBREY: I know. Why is it the little things that... that I miss the most? Like the way he'd tell a story. Same story a hundred times, but you'd always wanna hear the end. AUBREY: Hm. JIM: And how he'd get up every morning of his life, before the sun, no matter what time he'd gone to bed the night before. (SENTIMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) And his hands. (CHUCKLES) I can't stop thinking about his bloody hands. He'd pull out pod after pod after pod, no matter what the weather was like. I don't know how he managed it. They were always so warm. He'd pick me up and he'd put me on his lap, and let me take the wheel all the way back to port. He'd put them on my cheeks. I was half frozen to death. (MOBILE PHONE RINGING) Sorry. (SNIFFLES) - Oh, God. - What? Mother and Tamsyn have gone missing. AUBREY: Tams yn! JIM: Tams yn! Tam! AUBREY: Tamsyn! (BREATHING HEAVILY) If anything's happened to her, I won't forgive myself. ROWAN: You can't think like that, Jim. ROWAN: Tamsyn! Tamsyn! - Mother! - ROWAN: Maggie! Tam! Hey! Anything? We came up from the village, checked Blubber Point, nothing. - Right. - Jim. MORGAN: I'm here to help. Where the hell are they? Oh, Christ, no. She wouldn't, would she? What? The mine. (JIM BREATHING HEAVILY) Tamsyn! Mother! - Tamsyn! - Maggie! Maggie! - AUBREY: Tamsyn! - Keep going. Tamsyn! (JIM PANTING) Just stop a minute and listen! TAMSYN: Help! MORGAN: I heard something. JIM: Where? MORGAN: Over there. Down on the ridge. TAMSYN: Help! Oh, Christ. TAMSYN: Help! JIM: Tamsyn! TAMSYN: We're down here! - Oh! - Granfer! All right, stay there! Coastguard! Coming, Tam. You just stay calm, all right? Pull this away. One, two, three! JIM: Mind the dust, Tam. - Right. - Coastguard, please! - An emergency! - LEADVILLE: Got you, Jim! - You all right, Tam? - I'm scared and cold. - Mother! Mother! - TAMSYN: She's not waking up. - Is she breathing? - She's gone to sleep. Stay there! Do not move an inch! Hurry up! - Good girl! - TAMSYN: Don't leave! - Coastguard's on its way, Jim. - Tam's hurt her arm. Looks like it could be broken. Mother's unconscious. Don't know about her injuries. I'm gonna want to get down there. We haven't got time to wait for the Coastguard. We have to, Jim. They are on a ledge, 15 foot down. If that one gives way, they ain't coming out. So, you're gonna have to lower me down and haul us all out! COASTGUARD: (ON RADIO) Request for immediate Coastguard Rescue Team and helicopter assistance to Port Isaac mine. That's it. That's it. Nice. Yeah. (GRUNTS) MORGAN: Slow, slow, slow, slow. I'm sorry, it was my fault, Granfer. I begged her to take me here. Don't you worry about a thing, my love. - Come on, give me more! - JIM: Just slow, now. I wanna make sure this ledge can take me! - Easy, easy, easy! - Let it out, let it out. “Wait! - (MORGAN GRUNTS) TAMSYN: Watch out, Granfer! - MORGAN: All right, Jim? - Yeah. - All right! - MORGAN: Hold. Now, the only thing that matters is getting you out of here, all right, my precious? All right. What we're gonna do... Let me just check Grandma's pulse. TAMSYN: Is she gonna be all right? Yeah. Yeah, of course, she's gonna be all right. She's strong as an ox, like you, eh? - JIM: All right, haul away. - Pull! Haul away. Up. Up. (GRUNTING) MORGAN: I got you! I got you. I got you. (JIM GRUNTS) MORGAN: Hey, Jim! Jim! TAMSYN: Granfer! MORGAN: Are you all right? ROWAN: Jim! I'm okay. (SIRENS WAILING) (INAUDIBLE) (SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING) Thank you. - (SPEAKING WELSH) - Aye? One and all, Jim. One and all, mate. DOCTOR: She's got a broken collarbone and the ECG's still showing signs of an erratic heart rhythm, which isn't unusual for a hypothermic incident. No, I mean, she's gonna be all right, though, isn't she? Obviously, her age is a factor. So, the next 24 hours will be critical. You should go home and get some rest. We'll call you if anything changes. (JIM EXHALES) It's all right, Mother. I'm not leaving you. Tamsyn needs you now. I'll stay with her. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) Thought we might find you lot here. Oh, hello, lads. - Hi. - All right? - Yeah, yeah. - Hi, Aubrey. Hey. - Hi, Tam. How's your arm? - A bit better, thanks. How is she? Oh, doctor's just saying, just gotta wait. And hope. (SINGING) I stood on Cape Cornwall In the sun's evening glow On Chywoone Hill at Newlyn To watch the fishing fleets go Watched the sheave wheels at Geevor As they spun around And heard the men singing As they go underground ALL: (SINGING) And no one will ever Move me from this land Until the Lord calls me To sit at his hand For this is my Eden And I'm not alone For this is my Cornwall And this is my home First thing in the morning On Chapel Carn Brea To gaze at the Scillies In the blue far away For this is my Cornwall And I'll tell you why Because I was born here And here I shall die And no one will ever Move me from this land Until the Lord calls me To sit at his hand For this is my Eden And I'm not alone For this is my Cornwall And this is my home For this is my Cornwall And this is my home - AUBREY: A... - (TAMSYN STRUMS GUITAR) - AUBREY: ...to E. - (TAMSYN STRUMS GUITAR) AUBREY: Mm-hmm.

Thanks for letting me know. Good. Yeah. Yeah, she's gonna be all right. Oh, my God. She's gonna be all right, come here. (EXHALES SHAKILY) All right. Here.

Yeah. - JIM: Mind those steps. - Oh. All right. All right. All right. All right. (ALL CHEERING) Steady on. Careful. You give Long John Silver a run for his money. All you need is a parrot on your shoulder. Yeah, I gave you the black spot and all. (ALL EXCLAIM) - Hello, Aubrey. - How you feeling? I'm grateful to be alive, really. (LAUGHS) And I'm even more grateful that I've got a great, big strong son like I've got. - (LAUGHS) - JIM: There. Hewn from that Cornish granite just like five generations of fishermen before him. That's enough now. (LAUGHS) From what I can see, the women are hewn from the same rock. Oh. (LAUGHS) Come on, let's get you in that seat. Let's sit you down over here, all right? Don't fuss, my love. Thank you, don't. - Some things never change. - (ALL LAUGH) Thank you for looking out for my boy. - He's a lovely fella. - (CHUCKLES) - (PHONE RINGING) - Oh. MORGAN: Lovely to see you up and about, Maggie. Harbour View Bed and Breakfast. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION AND LAUGHTER) - Granfer, it's for you. - Yeah? He says his name is Michael Eavis. Michael? Michael Eavis? Hello? Hello? LEADVILLE: It's him. ROWAN: It's not him. Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, well, you're welcome. Oh, thank you. No, we'd be very happy to. Yes, yes, Michael. Yes, yes, yes. One more thing, yeah, yeah. You're a silly arse and I know what you're up to. (JIM LAUGHS) Oh! Danny, eh? (LAUGHS) Oh, messing around, putting on a dodgy West Country accent and all. - (LAUGHS) - Well, but, Jim, it's, uh, it's nearly four o'clock in the morning in Australia. Yeah, well, he's still getting used to the jetlag, isn't he? - After all this time? - Eh? Well, what did he say, anyway? He said he was grateful for the lobster we sent him, he loved the album, and then he invited us to play at Glasto this year. (ALL LAUGHING) I think you should call 1471, love. Oh, Mother, why would Michael Eavis be calling us here, eh? How would he get hold of our number? I think you should check, you know? Just in case. ROWAN: Go on, Jim! Check! LEADVILLE: Go on, Jim. Yeah. ROWAN: Go on, just ring him. (KEYPAD BEEPING) Well... Oh, it's ringing. It's ringing. Bugger me. It is him and all. - (ALL EXCLAIM) - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! (ALL LAUGHING) What have you been up to, Mother? Nothing. Just pulling a few strings. (EXASPERATED SIGH) Sorry, Mr Eavis. We'd be honoured to sing on your farm. JIM: It would mean the world to me if you'd come along to support us. AUBREY: I'm thrilled for you. I'm thrilled for all of you, but... I made a promise to myself to never go back to that world. Oh. Oh. It won't be the same without you, you know. That world doesn't change, Jim. No, people do. You have. And I'd be there with you this time. Oi! Sid and Nancy! Hey, no. No, no, no, come on, mate. Leave us alone. Back on the booze again, is it, Aubrey? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh. - Piss off! Go on, piss off! What do you want me to do? Kick your bloody arse? - Oh, Jim, no. - (JIM SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) No, Jim, don't, don't! Don't! That's what he wants! Go on! Get out of here! Get you nicked for that, mate. Get you breathalysed, too! - That's exactly what he wants. - Thank you very much! - God! (GROANS) - Hey! Hey, it's all right! What the hell were you thinking? No, it's over. - It's gone! - It's not over! Those pictures are gonna be everywhere! - So what, who cares? - I care! Why? What? Are you... What, are you... Are you embarrassed to be seen with me or something? No! It's not about you, Jim. You've made the papers, yes, but you don't know what this is like. You have no idea what it's like to be followed, to be judged, to be commented on. You have no idea! I came here to get away from all that. I came here for a simpler life, not a more complicated one. No, I'm sorry about that, but this doesn't have to be complicated. It's... I can't do this, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Aubrey! Aubrey! (PENSIVE MUSIC PLAYING) But they are booked to play Glastonbury! How much more convincing can a man want? Glastonbury is the issue. (OVER SPEAKER) The boys screwed up the Minack in front of The National Press. - Shh. - He doesn't want to risk them humiliating the label again on a global stage. But I can rein 'em in. It's not just their behaviour, Maggie. It's their voices. Hello, Leah. Jim here. What was that about voices? There's no easy way to say this. The president doesn't think you can cut it live. Bloody cheek! (FOLK MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) GARETH: Uh-oh. Nothing to do with me. Oh, Christ, what are they doing? Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention? Please do not be alarmed, this is not a robbery. No need to stand up or curtsy, for that matter. - Have you taken a wrong turn? - JIM: Huh? Billingsgate Market's that way. Uh, we're not here to sell you fish, Mr Chandra. JEZ: Really? That's right, we're here to sing for our supper. Well, this is lunch, actually. Yes, and we'd like to be left alone in peace to enjoy it as I'm sure everybody else here would, too. Well, why don't we let them be the judge of that, eh? A sing-a-long never spoiled anybody's appetite. It depends who's singing it. Well, that's the thing, Mr Chandra. Apparently you think that we can't cut it. But you've never even seen us perform. No, it's like sending your food back - before you've tasted it. - (MORGAN CHUCKLING) Rowan? Take it away. (SINGING) I've been a Wild Rover For many a year And I spent all my monies on whiskey and beer But now I'm returning with gold in great store And I never will play the Wild Rover no more MEN: (SINGING) And it's no, nay, never No, nay, never no more will I play the Wild Rover No, never, no more I went to an alehouse I used to frequent And I told the landlady my money was spent I asked her for credit, she answered me, nay Such a custom as yours I can have any day MEN: (SINGING) And it's no, nay, never No, nay, never, no more Will I play the Wild Rover No, never, no more I went to my parents -Confessed what I'd done -Yes, he did And I asked them to pardon their prodigal son And when they caress me as oft times before I never will play the Wild Rover no more ALL: (SINGING) And it's no, nay, never No, nay, never, no more Will I play the Wild Rover No, never, no more Come on, one more time! And it's no, nay, never No, nay, never, no more Will I play the Wild Rover No, never, no more (CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) Thank you. Well, they do say the customer's always right. Well? (INHALES SHARPLY) You've got yourselves a new record deal. (ALL CHEERING) Yes! Yes! Get in there! GARETH: All right. Oh. Proper job. Thank you. CHRIS EVANS: (ON RADIO) Good morning, everybody! If you're just tuning in, I am joined by Port Isaac's Fisherman's Friends. - (ALL CHEERING) - Come on. You are the world's oldest boy band, right? With a combined age of, uh... What's it? 643? - That's just Leadville. - (ALL LAUGHING) CHRIS: How do you feel about having being asked to sing at Glastonbury this year? As long as we don't forget to put our teeth in we'll be fine, eh? (ALL LAUGHING) Now, all big bands throughout the years have had their ups and downs and you are no exception. ROWAN: Well, it'd have been a bit boring if we hadn't weathered a few storms. Quite right, but I do actually think people listening would like to know what you guys fell out over. Was it... Was it more song list than shellfish? It was my behaviour, actually, Chris, I, erm... Yeah, well, my father had passed away, you know. I was drowning my sorrows and behaved like a complete arse. That's a big thing to admit to. Oh, actually, what was bigger is, the lads here, they supported me, and for the most part, anyway, they, uh... (LAUGHS) They forgave me, too. Well, that's a sign of true friendship. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Do you have any advice for people listening going through similar? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I know, it's been said a thousand times before, but it's worth repeating. It really is okay... not to be okay. Well, I think there's a lot of... a lot of blokes out there who find it hard to talk about their feelings and such. Probably starts out when they're boys, being told to... to man up and be strong and, you know, "Don't cry like a girl," that kind of thing. And then it ends up with men feeling embarrassed and ashamed when they can't cope. Now, I learned the hard way, see? It's not weak to ask for help. You know, they say that boys don't cry, well... This man does. Well, I can certainly identify with that. Uh, for anyone just tuning in, I am joined by Port Isaac's Fisherman's Friends whose brand-new album is out at the end of June. And if you've got a ticket to Glastonbury, do not miss this old bunch of pirates who are supporting Beyoncé. I mean, actual factual Beyoncé! - (ALL CHEERING) - (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) FEMALE SINGER: You're everywhere And nowhere, baby That's where you're at Saying everything is groovy When your tyres are flat And it's hi, ho, silver lining And away you go now, baby I see your sun is shining But I won't make a fuss And it's hi, ho, silver lining And away you go now, baby I see your sun is shining But I won't make a fuss Hello!

Fisherman's Friends are a band. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) Yeah, they're playing the Pyramid Stage this afternoon, so... - (CHUCKLES) - (CHUCKLES) Uh, sorry. I thought you were talking about the cough sweets. No, they're a band. (CHUCKLES) (SINGING) What shall we do with a drunken sailor? What shall we do with a drunken sailor? Early in the morning! Hooray, and up she rises... This is supposed to be the VIP area, can't they just behave? It's who they are. Just got to grip and grin, I suppose. (CONTINUES SINGING) ...the morning! (ALL CHEERING) Black coffee, please. Hello, Jim. Well, it's a strange place to come, if you're gonna stay under the radar. Some things are worth breaking cover for. - Oh, yeah? Like what? - Mm. Supporting someone I care about. - I heard you on the radio. - Oh. Waffling on. No. Saying important things that some people needed to hear. I shouldn't have walked away. I shouldn't have let you. Oh, I have missed you. (KISSES) Here's Mother. Hello, Aubrey. - Nice to see you again. - Nice to see you, too, Maggie. - Hi, Sally. - Hi. If you're thinking of, you know, hanging around a bit, uh, Sally and I were wondering if you would like to join a rather exclusive club. What kind of club? The FWAGs. FWAGs? "Fisherman's Wives and Girlfriends." - Oh, Christ. Oh, Mother. - (ALL LAUGH) - I'd be honoured. - Oh, good! (MEN LAUGHING) LEAH: Lads, what are you doing here? We've been looking everywhere for you. - Jim? - Yeah? Jim, what are you playing at? You know. It's not like we're stalking her or anything. "Dear Beyoncé, we're happy to share our dressing room, "just don't go nicking any of our songs. "Biggest and best, "Port Isaac's Fisherman's Friends." Lads, you're gonna get us thrown out. No, we won't. Listen, I just been chewin' the fat with her husband. He's a really top bloke, that Jay-Zed, isn't he? It's Jay-Z, you pillock. - (LAUGHING) - Come on! ROWAN: Yes! Jay-Z since forever. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY IN DISTANCE) (EXHALING) Fancy one last song, then? One last song. (CROWD CHEERING) Oh, come on. Oh, my God. LEADVILLE: Here we go! MORGAN: Bloody hell! Look at that! (CROWD CHEERING) We are the Fisherman's Friends from Port Isaac in Cornwall. (ALL CHEERING) Thank you, yeah. Now we are the men who've done for singing what Long John Silver did for tap dancing. (MEN LAUGHING) There's been an awful lot of things going on in the world at the moment that's dragging people apart. So I'm grateful that we're all here in this field at Worthy Farm today, about to have a good sing-song. And that's 'cause we all believe. We've got much more in common than we have which divides us. BAND MEMBER: That's right. And out first song is a celebration of that. And it's called The Union of Different Kinds. (CROWD CHEERING) (SINGING) For all the small people And the tall people For the dispossessed And the observers For all the broken-hearted And the recently departed For the unwashed And the unheard ALL: (SINGING) Mother Nature don't draw straight lines We're broken moulds in a grand design We look a mess but we're doin' fine We're card-carrying lifelong members Of the union of different kinds For all the lonely faces In those empty spaces For the unloved And the denied For the little wheel Turning bigger deal For the dreams that bloom And those that die ALL: (SINGING) Mother Nature don't draw straight lines We're broken moulds in a grand design We look a mess but we're doin' fine We're card-carrying lifelong members Of the union of different kinds - Whoo! - (LAUGHING) We made it. (LAUGHS) And if you ever fancy a change of scenery, I think the label could use a fixer like you. (LAUGHS) You're never gonna believe it! I've just bumped into a movie producer. He says he wants to make a film about the band! Well, that's definitely never gonna happen. (SINGING) And the river finds its end in the sea Yes, it does ALL: (SINGING) Mother Nature don't draw straight lines We're broken moulds in a grand design We look a mess but we're doin' fine We're card-carrying lifelong members Of the union of different kinds Come on, Glastonbury!

Soon may the Weller man come To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day, when the tonguing is done We'll take our leave and go When we first got picked up, this was the plan. We thought, "If we get to Glastonbury, that's it. "We've made it." (SINGING) The captain ordered all hands and swore He'd take that whale in tow, ho! It's a huge, mega deal for us! We're just hoping someone's prepared to get up that early in the morning to come and see us. (SINGING) Take our leave and go Before the boat had hit the water The whale's tail came up and caught her... MAN: We got through about ten checkpoints, - we had to strip naked... - (ALL LAUGH) We're finally in. MAN 2: Well, you didn't have to, Trev. I didn't have to, but one or two chose to do that. (SINGING CONTINUES) One day, when the tonguing is done We'll take our leave and go No line was cut, no whale was freed These songs were just evolved by ordinary people, and so, people can still relate to them now, you know, they are the people's songs. And we're the people championing them. (SINGING CONTINUES) To bring us sugar and tea and rum One day, when the tonguing is done We'll take our leave and go - It's very muddy out there. - It did look muddy. It's not so bad, though, is it? There's nothing like the real thing now, is there? (SINGING CONTINUES) Boats were lost There were only four But still that whale did go, ho! Soon may the Weller man come Wake up and smell the bacon. It's the Fisherman's Friends. (SINGING CONTINUES) Take our leave and go For 40 days or even more The line went slack then tight once more Cornish flags. Very important. "One and all", Cornish motto.
