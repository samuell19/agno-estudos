Gotcha! You know you shouldn't be reading this on your own? It'll give you nightmares. Please Mum, just one story! What about the Werewolf? Or the Wendigo? I like that one! Ah! Here we go. The Grota was a savage and powerful beast. One day a brave young Warrior, just like you, came passing through the village. She alone decided that all monsters, no matter how scary, could be defeated. The warrior fought long and hard but the monster was strong and vicious. She picked her moment, took her sword and with one thrust, jabbed the monster in its weakest spot! And... Boom! But that's enough for tonight. Mum? Be quiet for Mum Pumpkin. Mum? Sophie! Sophie. Sophie. Sophie. Sophie! Lesbo. This is so boring! Right! Everyone put your pens down. Stop writing! It seems Mona can't go five minutes without wanting everyone's attention. So I want everybody to look at her. Look at her! You're the reason this school is struggling. A dedicated student raises their class up. A fool drags it down and you Mona are making the whole class fail. That's not true sir. Sophie don't defend her, you're better than that. Listen freak! Why don't you go and mess up your own life somewhere else? Some of us actually have a future. Yeah Arya. And your's involves taking it from three guys on pay per view. Slut! Right! Straight to the head's office! I'm gone! OK everyone, back to work. You have fifteen minutes. Go and speak to her. You're still here then? Thanks. Mrs Harris loves me. She won't kick me out. Hey. I've got something for you. My brother is a right computer nerd. No offense Beth. What the fuck? Oh you look pretty. No! No way you can't hand those out! It's a bit late for that. Been giving them out all morning. Even gave Mrs Harris one! She can't make it though. Come to Sophie's party! I'm just getting the word out. I said a few people, not the whole bloody school. You're only eighteen once! Besides, it will be the perfect opportunity to pull Jess. Stuff this. Cancel your plans tonight party people because there is only one place to be. What the hell? Sophie's having a party? And it's going to be banging. Professional DJ, booze on tap. Loads of hot lads. And lasses. This looks great. I'm in. Babe? It will be fun. I'll put you on the guest list. Get there for eight. Don't be late! Brice. Phone! What are you doing? I'm extending Sophie's invitation. Giving that Muff Diver a birthday treat. Hello? I'd like to make a booking for tonight. Absinthe has been a party staple since like Medieval times. It's a social lubricant. Gets everyone in the mood. Oh? So who have you got your eye on tonight? What about that skater lad in Geography? Is he coming? Oh God no! He's well greasy. What are you doing? I heard you say you were going to have a party. You only turn eighteen once so I wanted to make it special. Thanks Dad. Dad? Can I have a word please? In private? Come on Beth. Lets go get the drinks ready. Thank you. Thanks. I'm very proud of you. Dad. Listen! I know you don't want to hear your old man banging on. You're a special kid pumpkin. You've got so much potential. You're just like her. My friends are here. I'm not going to embarrass you. I've held on to this for too long. It's the book she used to read me. I don't want it! Mum would want you to have it! We used to call it the Book of Monsters. Oh, that's it! I liked the pictures. It' wasn't my first choice for bed time stories but your mother was unconventional. That's why I married her. I know I don't measure up. Dad. I do love you. And, I miss her too. I'll get out of your hair. Don't go too crazy tonight. It will be very tame. I'll see you downstairs. So what have you three got planned for this evening? Oh, you know! Just a quiet night in with the girls. Bed by midnight, OK? Bye! He has no idea. This is shit! I knew no one would come. No one ever comes here! Don't be like that! It's still early. Well! This is shabby. Get me some wine! You can put your coats over there and there is drinks on the side and... Or you could just do that. See. Party central. Who are these people, they don't go to our school? Relax! Hello handsome. Hey. Thanks. Cool party. Hi Sophie. Thanks for inviting me. Drink? We're in Geography together. I sat next to you last year. Oh! Sorry, of course. What's your name again? That's OK, it's Gary. Chug, chug, chug! Oh, this was a bad idea. Thanks for the drink Gavin! It's Gary. OK. Hey! I'm still drinking that! You're welcome! Watch this. Happy birthday! Stay Hydrated! Oh Shit. You alright? For the beer. Thanks. I'm sorry about Brice and Arya. Why do you hang around with them? Yo Who are you big man? That was horrible. Don't get up, big man! What a looser! I swear... You know what I mean? What the fuck? Sorry. Hi. I had two currys last night, I'm really sorry. Em... It's cool of your Dad to let us have a party. He doesn't know. God. He's going to kill me when he sees the state of it. Well, then you might as well enjoy your last night. Oh my God! What is that? Lightweight. Wait, no wait, that's my bedroom! Never mind. I know a good dry cleaners. For your sheets. Eww! Come on, lets go back inside. So what class are you in? What are you looking for? Sophie! The Police are here! What? They're at the front door. You'll have to answer it! Are you Sophie? I'm afraid we've had reports of a disturbance. I'm gonna have to place you under arrest. For what crime? A crime of passion! So you're a big re/ Big reader then? I like reading. I like reading fantasy novels. I'm going to a book signing soon. Tell me. Are you a Virgin? I've never kissed a girl before. Thought so. Oh shit son! What are you... Fuck this. Whoo! You're done hot stuff. Kill the music! Show's over. Just when she was getting a taste for it! Enjoy that did you? I thought you were different. I'm sorry kid, I was just told to show you a good time. Fuck off. Fair enough. Mona just leave it. She deserves it. Listen to your freak Mona. What is your problem? Sophie's gay, get over it. Gay is the least of her worries. We all know about little Sophie's trip to the looney bin. Oh, yeah. Didn't you know? Sophie thinks the Bogey Man killed her Mummy. Even her Dad thought she was crazy. Sent her to a mental Hospital for a year! My parents still think he did it. But maybe Sophie snapped and chopped Mummy up into little pieces? You bitch! Oh now you're going to get it. Hey guys! Am I late for a party? Oh God! Anders! Look out man! No! Oh fuck! Guys come on! Arya! Arya, what the fuck? Stripper Guy! Stripper Guy, help me! My hands! What the fuck are you doing? Come on. Sophie! Come on, come on! Sophie! Beth! Get out! Run! Come on! Tanya. I had math class with her. Where now? In here! You'll be safe here. A monster! A fucking monster! A big fucking monster! Help me! You get a lap dance and full frontal! You didn't pay me for this shit! Help me! This way! Come on. We need to get help. Wait. Who is that? Run! We need to call the police. I already have. What? But you weren't even there. I heard what was going on. What are you doing? We need to keep safe. Until the police arrive. Not by locking us in. It's the best way to keep safe! No! Stop! Who are you? Check the back door. This was meant to be a friendly party, a friendly atmosphere! Check the back door! You check the back door! I'm going to call the police. Have you got a phone on you? I'll check the back door. Come on, come on you piece of shit! Hello, Police? I have to be quick so please listen. My house is being robbed right now! I live at Hollow Farm. Down the valley through Hollow Wood. Please hurry! We're not being robbed, we're being killed! And what was I supposed to say? That a giant fucking monster has killed half our classmates? I don't think they'd believe that. I don't believe that. Yeah, OK that's pretty clever. Find the key! I'm calling the police. No! What the hell? We need to keep safe! What the fuck is wrong with you? You bastard! Wait here. Sophie? I know what it is. That can't be right, how can that be right? Sophie, what is it? I... I've seen it before. Not in the flesh but in a book. Ooh! Do you have a hair clip? I've had to break myself out of my own handcuffs a few times. Idiot! It can't be real. What book was this? It was something my Mum used to read me before bed. I don't understand. How do we kill it? There is something. Something I remember. There's a spot. A weak spot. On its back. I saw it, it's there. I know how to kill it. Trust me. Just have to hit that spot. With what? We should stick together. Fuck you! Argh! No one steals my look! Wait here OK. Shit! What are those little bastards? Whoa, whoa, whoa, they're doing something! Shit! You have got to be fucking kidding me! No! No, no, no, no, no, no! Fuck off! Kill them! Weeee! No, no, no, noooo! Huhh! Open the Microwave! Weeeeee. Fry you fucker! Get back here! Where's the last one? Over here! Get off him! Whooo! Who are you? I'm Gary. Good job Greg. Lets get the fuck out of here! Back inside. Now! How many of those things are there? In here, it's safe! We need to barricade the door. There's more outside. You came back. Grant here just saved our lives. Lets get this place secure. Has anyone seen Mona? What? Easy. You took quite a blow. That guy? Yeah. Not a guy. Some kind of fucking monster. He took a beating and then took to the window. God knows where he, She. Is now. Come on. Lets get the hell out of here. Listen. I will get you out of here. I promise. You throw a shit party. Arya. I'm really sorry for your loss. Brice was/ Brice was a fucking idiot. But his Dad had a Porsche. He let us drive it sometimes. He didn't deserve to die. Just give me that. I'll take it, let go. Mona! Are you OK? I'm fine. She needs a seat. What's that Mona? Why have you go that? I thought it might be useful. What do you mean, useful? This is really old. Hey guys! The Police are here! Car fifteen responding to call from Hollow Farm. Holy shit. You know where we are, right? Yeah, in the middle of fucking nowhere. No! Ten years ago, Homicide. Late one night, Dad goes home, Finds his wife chopped to bits under his kid's bed. It was all over the papers. Kid saw the whole thing. Only eight years old. Fucking hell. They caught the guy, right? No. And that's not the strangest thing. According to the kid, it wasn't a guy at all. It was... A monster! Wanker! Fuck. Stay here Rookie. I'll go and check out the place. Fuck you Keith. Help me! Keith, this is not the time to be fucking around. My God! Monster! Shit! Oh, come on! Oh, shit! Shit. We're on our own. Found anything? I've barely scratched the surface but here, look. Our party crasher. No, this! That's Mum's handwriting. Where did your Mum get this? I don't know. It's been around our house for years. I think it might have been my Grandma's. It doesn't matter where the book came from if it's got some answers! Jess. The monster in my bedroom. What did it look like? How should I know? I was unconscious. But you saw something, right? I don't know. I remember the sound of breaking glass. Bitch. Fuck! That looks like the one that killed the police. It's got us all trapped in here with no way out. Jess, hang on. According to Gary. That thing. Released these worms. And we're all familiar with that one. I never want to meet that one. Wait. This symbol. It's on all of the pages of the monsters we've seen tonight. I've seen that symbol before. To summon the five. A sacrifice must be made. Only the blood of a Virgin. On the eve of. A ritual sacrifice. On the eve of what? Five points. Five monsters. All with this symbol. And we've seen three of them. Which means there's still two more to come. If someone performed a ritual sacrifice. Then whose blood is that? What about that geeky guy in the Hawaiian shirt? He was probably a Virgin. At least, until he went into your bedroom. The girl in red. Wait, no. When me and Mona went into your room, that guy was fine. The girl wasn't there. How do you explain that? Unless. It's a Shape-shifter. Are you OK? That's the one that killed Mum. She wrote some notes in the margins. Cunning and smart. Imitates its prey. Can control the other monsters. No known weaknesses. And that last note simply says. Run. It could have killed me ten years ago. If this thing really is behind all this. Why wait until tonight to finish the job? Jess, over here! It's OK. I think she just needs a friend right now. What's a Jinn? Oooooh! Hey! You can't do that. She said I could! Wow. That's one creepy house. What now? Where did she go? Gary! Hey man! Move! Ow, what happened? And why do my balls hurt? Beth? Are you OK? Come on, where are you? Sophie, tell me you have something! A Jinn can posses anyone but never the same person twice! Something useful! We need to wind it! If we can force it out, we can trap it back in the picture! Jess, get the picture! Get ready. For what? Sorry Beth. Nice one. I'm alright. Guys. I killed him. It's not your fault Gary. I'll put him with the others. Shall I? What are you doing here? I was hiding from the monsters and you brought one here! Shit. You're that German exchange student. Helga, right? So you don't have a clue what I'm saying. Well, for what it's worth. There was a huge fucking monster attack that killed a bunch of people. Then this shape-shifting bitch threw me out a window and now I've got this weird axe man thing stalking me and you don't have a clue what I'm saying! Brilliant! I understand perfectly. I was at the party and escaped. I was perfectly safe hiding here until you turned up! Don't worry Helga. We're going to stick together. We need to find my friends and make sure they're OK. Well count me out! That's the spirit. I'm Mona by the way. I know! You're the girl who is always in trouble at school! It's a handshake. Means we're partners now. Come on. What are you doing? You can't go that way, you'll be killed! I have a car parked just around the corner. If we head back the other way, we can get out of here! I know you're scared but you've got to be quiet. In a moment we'll get our chance and we'll make a run for it. What?! Now! Get off me! My car's this way you idiot! Helga! See, there's a definite pattern in the notes. What was Mum up to? She knew all sorts. Breeds of monsters, their vulnerable spots, how to hunt them. I just wish she'd finished translating the book. Me too. Near as I can tell, each of these monsters was summoned by the blood ritual. But the rituals over now, right? I don't know. There's something missing. Also, there's something else that's been bothering me. That thing could kick the door down and slice us all to pieces at any minute but he hasn't. Why? And, when I was possessed by the Jinn. I couldn't control my actions but I could feel what was going on and when I had my hands around your neck, He wasn't trying to kill you. This thing had be backed into a corner. It could have killed me in an instant but instead, it hesitated. They're keeping you alive. For how long? We've been lucky so far. But I doubt a cake knife is going to get us past what's outside. If Mum really knew all these things, she must have had a way of defending herself. If I was a monster hunter I'd have kept a shotgun above the fireplace. It's the farm. That's the house... and the barn. But what's that? Vault. What does that mean? Well whatever it is, it must be underground. All that's out there is a field. It looks like there's a way in through the barn. Slim chance of getting there in one piece. There was another way. My Mum and Dad had the house renovated when I was really little. They had the fireplace removed. Over where the radiator is now. There could be a safe way out. You just couldn't wait, could you? Not quite midnight but I'm sure we can stretch this out. There's plenty of your little friends to kill first. Who the hell are you? You might recognise this face! Come here beautiful! Arya! Let me see what your insides look like! This way! Beth. Beth! We're just in here. Is Jess with you? No. Jess! Sophie! I'm coming! Don't go! Jess. Sophie. Here, come this way. Jess! Sophie! Come and get her Sophie! I'll be waiting for you! Sophie come on! Over here! It's taken Jess. Guys? I don't want to die Sophie. You are not going to die. Guys? I wouldn't let anything happen to you. I promise. And hey. If tonight proves anything. At least you know I'm not crazy. Guys, will you look at this! Your Mum had a weapons room! What? Sophie. Mum? That's what I'm going to call her. Jonas is over the moon. He's always wanted a girl but this changes everything. I can't go chasing monsters into the dark anymore. Not until Sophie is old enough to know the truth. They'll come for her. On the eve of her eighteenth. But when that night comes I'll be standing right beside her. The monsters will always be a threat. And it's my responsibility to hunt them. Soon it will be Sophie's too. No matter what, I'll protect this precious life growing inside of me. You're gonna have a lot on your shoulders kid. But I'll be with you, every step of the way. Sophie. This is why they've been keeping me alive. They need my blood to complete the ritual. They just had to wait until I turned eighteen. So what happens if they finish the ritual? We barely survived a handful of them. There are hundreds of monsters in that book. No. We have to run, there has to be a way. Beth. We need to get you out of here! If they can't find you! They have Jess! I won't leave her to die. I'm the only reason that thing, hasn't killed her yet. This one isn't like the other ones Sophie. You saw the book. There's no vulnerable spot, no secret trick to killing it! Then we do this the old fashioned way. This is my party! Lets kill some fucking monsters! Sophie. Over here. Are we ready for this? We're gonna head back to the house and kill anything that gets in our way. I think we should only kill the monsters. Yes Beth. I think she only meant the monsters Beth. That's good. Follow me. Please, you have to help me. I'm dying and there is a monster out there! She doesn't look good. What happened to you? At last! I was at the party when the monster attacked and hid in the barn. Mona showed up a little after. Mona? I tried to get her to follow me I have a car nearby, if only she had listened. Is she alive? Come on. crickets chirping) Sophie! Sophie! Sophie. How do I know you're the real Mona? When you were twelve, you had the biggest crush on Katy Perry. Still do. Oh God, I thought you were dead. I'm still here. You look bad ass. And Beth. You look fierce. I'm glad you're alive Mona. Me too. So. We're going back to the house. Get some drinks. Kill some Monsters. You coming? Hell yeah. Lets do this! Alright. You've already gone. OK! I didn't know your clock did that. It doesn't. Guys? I need a pee. Sorry. When you've gotta go, you've gotta go. Bathroom's down there. I'll be quick. Kill me. Kill me! Kill me! Sophie! Jess! Mona! Gary needs us! Sophie. You go with Beth. I've got this. Gary! Mona! Mona, come on! No, Gary! Happy Birthday Sophie. Let her go! You've grown up so much since we first met. And like the fatted calf, you're ready to be slaughtered. With your blood, I will summon all of my kin! And then the ritual will finally be complete! Will you scream for me Sophie? Just like Mummy did? Die you monster scum! Come on Gary. Come on Gary! Gary. Do not die! Sophie. Sophie. It's Mum. Sophie. Mum? What are you doing darling? I'm so disappointed in you. Put that thing down! You should be ashamed of yourself! Nice try Bitch! Jess! Get a room! Or at least clean this one up! Beth. Sophie! Jess! Is Gary OK? I thought I was a Gonner. But Beth saved me. Are we safe? For now. What about this? I'm gonna study it. Use it. Find all the monsters and kill them all. And we'll help you. Can we go to the Hospital first please? Hi. What the fuck? Hello. Let's do this!
