[GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC] [WOMAN SOFTLY HUMMING] [HUMMING CONTINUES] [HUMMING CONTINUES] Mary! Mary! I need you to come quick! [EERIE MUSIC] This ain't pretty, ma'am. [MARY GASPING] Are these William's clothes? Yes. [MARY GASPING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] MR. BRECK: All right. All right. Quiet down. Quiet down. Quiet. We've all gathered here to find solutions, not to create chaos. I know most of you have questions. I do. You're all scared. And rightly so. We've had a brutal act of violence instilled upon us yet again. [SIGHS] Poor Mary's husband. Most of you knew William. He was an upstanding young man. Hard worker, big heart. Calloused hands. I heard he wasn't all there. When he was found, that is. MR. BRECK: That's true. So this is like how they found Fred Hillard then. -And the Kensington boy. -Yeah. It's no secret that we have had a fox in the henhouse. This individual has disrupted our way of life, a peaceful way at that. We all came out here from back east. Most of us, to escape the war. And raise our families in solitude. I don't think any of us expected the horrors that we have faced in recent months. None of us. I've asked those in surrounding areas for assistance and they have responded in kind. MISS MAPLE: How so, Mr. Breck? Who has come to help us? I don't see any badges. I see scared people. MR. BRECK: I assure you, Miss Maple, that there are men among us that are here to help. And we would do best to stay out of their way and let them do their jobs as they see fit. It's times like these that their professions matter more greatly than our own. I have been assured that this man, this murderer, shall be dealt with. And what of the deceased? A burial would be the right thing to do. Is there any volunteers? Good. Well, how 'bout Sunday? That's still the Lord's Day isn't it? Good. Mary. Mary. Do you have any objection to this? My husband did not have much. Meanin' I do not have much. But I'm willing to give every penny that I have as well as the plot of land that we moved here for if someone or persons would be willing to give me in exchange a pistol, a rifle, a horse for travel and provisions for the trail. And what do you need these things for, Mary? Surely there are enough men here that would be glad to escort you back east, home to your mother and father, if that's what you wish. I assume that's what you want those possessions for? No, Mr. Breck. I aim to kill the man that took my husband from me. Mary, we all know how devastated you feel. And we sympathize. I'm not askin' for your sympathy, Mr. Breck. Nor did I make any such request to be escorted back home. My money, my land, regardless of how you feel on the matter, I do not believe any one of you is in a financial position to refuse such an offer. This is insane, Mary. Mary. It's not ladylike. MISS MAPLE: Mr. Breck. When we agreed to come here, the ladies within us stayed behind. This is a land of harsh consequences and abrupt action. Mary here is only doing what her gut is telling her and none of you can say that you feel any different. All I can do is give warning. I fought in the Great War, I know what it's like to take a man's life. And that is a road once traveled you can never return. The blood does not wash from your hands and the memories never fade. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Take this to mind, Mary. Revenge is a dangerous motive, and if indeed you go trollopsing into the wood after this man, he will not be the only monster you will find. MISS MAPLE: Mary. Yes. How you holding up? I am not sure, Miss Maple. May I? Please. That was quite a show. Was it a show? I had quite thought it was honesty. It certainly was. Those men, Mr. Breck especially, they're just not used to hearing it spoke so plain, hm. Matter of fact, I don't think that he's heard a woman speakin' up at all. Hm. This was my husband's. He made quite the living off of this thing. Hm. Used to hunt with it, went off, fought a war with it. It was his favorite possession. I'm not sure how many men he killed with it. But it certainly has seen death. Which is why I'm giving it to you. [DRAMATIC STRING MUSIC] I don't have much use for it. I was never good with a rifle. Even if the situation might arise, where intention to use it was called for, I... don't think my stomach could handle it. That's why I envy you and pity you all at the same time. Mary, the times being what they are, I do see cause for it. I saw your eyes today, your heart burns with a vengeance that could fuel the fires of hell. Lucifer could not go toe to toe with you. Are you capable of traveling? More importantly, are you capable of killing this man? William taught me how to shoot last spring. Borrowed Emery Steven's Henry. Showed me it was all in the breathing, timing. He never did care for weapons. Of any kind, that's why he never owned one. William never fought in the war? No. He made shoes in Boston. My father taught me how to strike flint. My mother showed me how to cook. Figure as long as I have a good cast-iron skillet, I can make just about anything out there on the trail. Mary, why did William bring you to Oregon? What made him change shoemaker to lumberman? MARY: William always wanted to show me the Pacific and the promise for adventure. [GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC] You keep your land, Mary. It's all you'll have to remember William by when all this is done. Assuming you survive the wilds of this place and find the man who murdered your husband. There's a pistol in here freshly clean. Flint, a canteen, tack, and a bedroll. It's everything that you need to survive as long as you know what you're doing. Mr. Barley... is holding a horse for you. And he thinks that you're going to be taking it down to Oak Bay so that you can get the coach to San Francisco. MARY: Don't let them bury William... until I return. [GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC] [DRAMATIC STRING MUSIC] Good to see you again, Mary. All right then, let's go. So, headed to Oak Bay, are ya? Well, stay on the trail, don't stop if you don't have to. Godspeed. Thank you, Mr. Barley. I hope you find what you're looking for. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Sh, sh, sh. [WHISPERS] Come, come here. MARY: Go ahead. Good, yeah, yeah. [GUNS CLICKING] You shouldn't be out on the trail, Miss. Camp's down here. There's a fire too. Well, come on. I'm not following you gentlemen, but can you give me any details, any information? We've heard tales. It's big as a mountain, strong as a bear. Every time he kills, he leaves a trail of bones. Been followin' that animal all up and down this coast. You should go home in the morning, ma'am. It's not safe here. Is it safe at home? [MAN SNIFFING] Hey. You smell that? [MEN SNIFFING] That's tobacco. [MARY YELPS] This is my bounty, Silas. You and that horse-buggering son of a bitch you call a sidekick better stay out of my way! [GUN SHOTS] [GUN SHOT] -Hey, jack ass. -[MAN GROANING] -[THUD] -[MAN GROANS] [MARY GASPING] [GUN CLICKS] Young lady, if you value your life, you best make yourself scarce. This ain't no place for a woman with thoughts of savagery on her mind. Now you go home and grieve. [WHISPERS] Yeah. Sh. [MARY SIGHS] [MEAT SIZZLING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [GUN CLICKS] JEBEDIAH: Spy somethin' you like down there? Easy now. I done told you once already. Huntin' evil ain't no occupation for the womenfolk. And this I will say one time, just once. Don't nothin' stand between me and my bounty. Not the law, nor any man, and certainly not a spindly little piece like you. Understood? Don't make me put one in ya. Just to be sure. [DRAMATIC STRING MUSIC] [EERIE CHOIR MUSIC] Well, I got plenty of salted meat for sale. Black powder, some cartridges, but not a ton. Hard tack and most other necessities. You can rent a bed for a dollar a night. Trail doesn't look like it's been kind to ya. Listen, lady, I'm about as harmless as a beaver. If I was not, odds are I would be feedin' the worms and my reputable business here would be in ashes. Coffee. Do you have coffee? Yes. I have coffee. Can't say I've had too many women stop up here. You must be engaged in something peculiar to be wandering alone around in these parts, ma'am. What do you require? Dry bed. And? Hard tack. Bread of any kind. What else? Lamp oil would be nice. That'll run ya ten dollars. Six. Eight. Seven. Fair. Is someone after you, ma'am? No. Then I don't have to be worried about a bullet findin' my innards in the middle of the night then? If a bullet finds you in the middle of the night, it is not because of me or my affairs. Sir. The name's Monty. It's short for Montgomery. Montgomery Gower, but that's a terrible name, so Monty will do just fine. Mary. Mary Ellen O'Malley. The widow. Word travels fast in these parts. Sometimes faster than the wind itself. I heard of a terrible thing that happened a bit down south. That is where you come from, is it, the south? Hell of a journey that you must have been on, I'm sure. MARY: The man that desecrated my husband, my William, I aim to find him and kill him. But of course. You've come this far. Can't imagine that a humble trader such as me could change the mind of a determined woman such as you. I would feel the fool if I even tried. And a fool you would look, sir. May revenge be just. And the dead rest in peace. Ah. He was not whole. Whoever did that to my husband, he took pieces like they were souvenirs. What kind of man does that, Mr. Gower? When I was in the war, winters were hard. Men were cold, food was scarce, it seemed as though it would never end. Even when we knew spring was just around the bend. We acquired a private one day, from some other company. A company that had been up in the mountains. [EERIE STRING MUSIC] And this private, he had that look in his eyes you see. A look that said a thousand words. That he had seen horrible things. The boy never spoke, till one night he snapped awake right next to me. Right in the middle of a blasted night, woke me up out of a good dream. And I'll never forget the words that come out of his mouth. "We ate him," he said. "We ate him all up." You see, those boys, been up in those mountains weeks since any resupply. It was too cold to hunt, most game had taken to hibernation anyhow. I never heard a word about what happened to that boy's company. But I have my suspicions. And what are they, Mr. Gower? I believe that boy did what he had to do to survive. And when men are faced with choices like that it can drive them mad. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GENTLE BANJO MUSIC] Lamp oil and a loaf of bread. I put in a pack of cards for those long, lonely nights. It's nice to have the company. And honest conversation. Most times all I get is a list of items thrown at me in a stern voice and when prices are mentioned, conversation turns into a hostile war cry. Where will you go now? Now to keep to the game trail and head north. That is the direction in which I believe he is headed. What makes you so sure? Been the most heavily trafficked. Well, what relevance does that have? Well, I believe he has a taste for violence. In more ways than one. So he'll keep to where the prey is easy. Oh, the way a bear hunts an elk. Course if I had to choose between huntin' a man or huntin' a grizzly, I would choose the grizzly, you can bet your last penny on that. MARY: Why's that? Grizzly's don't shoot back, Mary. No. No, they do not. You take care, Ma'am. Don't lose your cards. [GUN SHOTS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [WATER LAPPING AT SHORE] -[MARY GASPS] -I told you once! [GUN FIRES] Now you leave me no choice. I know you killed the Marshall! Shit. [BOUNTY HUNTER GRUNTING] Son of a bitch! Damn it! Now you done it, now you extinguished my cigar. And I don't like that. [GUN SHOT] I have never been good at listenin'. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [OMINOUS MUSIC] Huh? Oh. [LAUGHS] They want to know, where did you hail from? What was your name? Now, these are questions indeed I would ask myself if remorse was a friend of mine, but, alas, he doesn't visit me very often. No, he does not. Who loved you? Hm? Who did you love? Did love ever really know you? Better yet, did you ever really know love? Can anyone know love? I don't know. However, I did know of a girl once, her name was Flora. Oh, I liked Flora. Her skin was so smooth and soft, like a baby. Her eyes, as blue as the sea. A smile as bright as the midday sun. Her laugh, it would brighten the darkest caverns of my inner soul. [LAUGHS SOFTLY] What? Speak up. Quiet! What happened to Flora? I poked her eyes out. 'Cause she was lookin' at Michael Sneedly with lust. I bit her tongue off because she wouldn't stop screaming. People... like flies buzzing around cattle. At least cattle is worth something. People, just bags of flesh and bone. Flesh and bone. Well, flesh and bone does have a little value to me. My apologies. Back to you. Now, to me, you seem like a simpleton. The kind of man that values the things that he can put around himself. Take, take, take, take, take. That's what you do. I've seen your kind. You cut down the wooden giants and you burn them with your hellfire. Kill all of God's creatures, the elk, the deer, each other. You desecrate this land. Why? Because you can. Because it has value to you. It means something... to you. [LAUGHING] But your arm, and your leg, and your head, see, now that... now that has value to me. [LAUGHING] Man has no natural enemy in this world. So I must be that of which man is afraid. [GUN FIRES] [SCREAMING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] MARROW: Where are you? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Come out, come out wherever you are. [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MARY SCREAMING] [MAN LAUGHING] [MARY BREATHING HEAVILY] [MAN LAUGHING] I'm comin' for ya! Suddenly I feel like dancing. Do you want to dance with me, mate? Woo! [LAUGHING] See you! [GUN SHOT] [MARY BREATHING HEAVILY] MARROW: Agh, I grow tired of this game. I grow tired of this chase, mate. You're hardly worth the trouble. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [MARY COUGHING] Aw, you look scared, little one. You should take comfort in knowing that not one bit of your sweet flesh will be of waste. [GUN CLICKS] [LAUGHS] Well, we do prefer things a bit more intimate anyway. Don't we? [GUN CLICKS] [MAN SCREAMS] My turn. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [GROANING] [LAUGHING] Oh, oh. Ah. Yeah, I know. I know! Gotta stop the bleeding, I know, I know. [GROANING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [LAUGHING] [GUN FIRES] [MAN LAUGHING] You missed! [LAUGHING] Save your bullets! [MAN LAUGHING] Oh, ho, [LAUGHING]. [OMINOUS MUSIC] [LAUGHING] Work for your supper! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Oh, meat, you did want to dance with me. Let's dance. MARROW: No! This is not, no meat. It's not your choice. It's not. You, you have no right! No! No, meat, this is not up to you, meat. [GUN SHOT] [GRUNTS] This world needs me! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [MUSIC BECOMES GENTLER] [MARY GROANING] [GENTLE MUSIC] [MARY SOBBING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC]
