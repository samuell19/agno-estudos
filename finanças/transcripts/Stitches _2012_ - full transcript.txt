Here comes the cake. Here's your cake. Are you ready? Blow out the candles. Nine, ten! Yes. Yeah look, I'll be back in about an hour. Keep yourself on the boil. Aye. What are you talking about, love? Yeah. There's some biscuits under the sink. - Oi, you two. Not in the house. - Go to hell. Uh, bring it to us. - Gimme, here. - You stop it. Stop! Now, will you stop? Gimme that. You can see my house from here. Happy birthday! Tom and Kate sitting in a tree. Get out of the way, you little bastards. - How do you do? - You're late. And you're fucking ugly. Just kidding, love. Right, it's cash upfront. No dough, no show. Right, here he is, Stiches the Clown. Whoo-hoo. Everybody happy? Was that a trick? - Is everybody happy? - You're an asshole, you big dumb clown. Get on with the show, you loser! Yes. Bastards. Right, who's the birthday boy? - It's a clown. - That's gonna be worth nothing. That's plastic. Right, the hat of mystery. Ooh, empty hat. Empty hat. - Now that's what I'm talking about. - Oh, yeah! - What do you want to see? - A Stegosaurus. The balloons for the... for the dinosaurs are extinct. You can have a dog. - I don't want a dog. I want a Stegosaurus. - I love the dog. No, shut it, you. - No, you shut it. You're not my dad. Shut up. - Sure, I might be. - Right, here we go. - What is that even supposed to be? It's a bloody Velociraptor, isn't it? Look, there's a bit there. Bastard! Fall in, men, fall in. At ease, at ease! Attention! - You're rubbish. - Oh, I hate this trick. Can you start juggle? How could your mother get this guy? Right, kids. Now it's time for Funny Bones. Are you serious? Say hello, Funny Bones. "Hello Funny Bones." Goodbye, Funny Bones. - Nice one. - You are so violent. Right, here it is. Juggling. I'll kill you. Throw it out. Oh! Oh! - Yeah! - Finally this clown does something good. You bastard. Okay, anybody want... Get out of my way, bitch! You may want to get some sleep. Richard 'Stiches' Grindle "Everybody Happy" (Clown speaks phony language) (Clown speaks phony language) (Clown speaks phony language) (Clown speaks phony language) You are not our charge. But hear this. A clown that doesn't finish a party can never rest in peace. And the joke is never as funny the second time around. 6 YEARS LATER Six o'clock in the morning? Couldn't you have found an earlier flight, Denise? I don't know how I'm gonna stay awake in the meeting. No, no. No, no, no. Don't worry. No. I know my way around London. Yeah, happier times. Anyway, I better go. All right, bye. Well, all under control. Look good? You okay? Yeah, just homework. I got a maths test on Friday. And you're not gonna be here for my birthday. What? You little shit! Tom, I'm sorry, but if I don't go, they'll gonna send Bernie, and I can't loose any more hours to that cunt. If you're worried about being on your own, why don't you call one of your friends? - And ask them to come over. - I'll think about it. What's the matter? I don't like the look of it. Happy birthday! - Do you have your lunches, honey? - Yes, Mom. Just shut up. - How's it going? You all right? - Don't bother. - Yeah, gagging for it. Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, gagging for nothing. Get a grip. Cock-fucking bitch. - Wanker. - Twat. Prick. Kate, you should've been there. Jammed for four hours straight last night. Fintan described one of my solos as "brainal penetration". I played so hard you couldn't hear the rest of the band. I'm thinking of changing our band name to "Dan". Fintan was so moved by one of my solos that he wept for four hours. We had to play without a drummer. It's just okay. I just worked the bass drum on my foot for like... Still, I wish my number one groupie could've been there. Hey, not in school. And I'm not your groupie. - So you gonna get a phone? Ring me maybe? - I've got a phone. I've got three phones. - You were supposed to ring about eight. - Well, I was busy. - Yeah, obviously listening to your solos. - And working a bass drum with my foot. Yeah. You know, I'm really sick of you not calling, so maybe you should sit that out. - Okay, I'll just... I'll see you later. - I'll... Kate? Hey, Tom, so, can I have that homework? English class, five minutes. Please. I haven't... I haven't done it. Oh, come on, babe, you scratch my back, I'll scratch your back. - If that's okay with you? - I'd really rather you didn't. I think, Tom, we're still mates, aren't we? Sorry there, fuck-face. I mean apologies, old bean. Ta-ra for now, love. Okay, settle down. Settle down. Page 36. Try and answer a couple of them on your own this time. - Who's the new chick? - She's not new. That's Mary. Mary? You're fucking shitting me. - What the fuck? - You've seen Monster Munch Mary? Yeah, she hasn't been Monster Munch Mary since last summer. She went to boot camp or took a massive shit or something. Hey, are you doing anything this weekend on Saturday? No. You know, I'm just thinking. Maybe you could come around. We could have a couple of beers. I've got a box set of Vin Diesel movies. You know. - Hold on. You have a free house? - Yeah, but not like that. - Who's coming? - No one, just you. - What about Richie and Bulger? - No, two's company. Three's a party. - Did someone say "party"? - Party? Will there be cake? There's no fucking party. No talking! No talking in class. Oh, fuck! And here we have the male reproductive organ. - Presto. - Oh, my God, look how small that is. Give me back my dick. Give me it back. Your time is up, Tom. Your time is up. Please hand in your papers, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you again for your sterling efforts. That will be all for today. Blondie, more of a stretch here. Lose those pounds. You've put too many on. Scarecrow, come on. Do something there. You always wear the pink, you sissy, move! Now, come on! Betty Boo, put more of an effort into that. Come one, you Fatso. Get a move on there, Specky. Here, what are you doing standing there? Get a move on it. That's very good. You! You do that. Hey Magic, get rid of that fucking ball and start stretching. Yeah. What the... - Are you ordering food online again? - No. Of all the people to have a free house and he doesn't wanna have a party. - Vinny, give him a break. - Why? Because it's his birthday this weekend. - It's his birthday this weekend? - Yeah. Like this weekend coming? Yes, this weekend coming. It's his birthday. And garlic bread. Okay! I was thinking, this weekend, total surprise party for Tom. Dude, that's like flashing a strobe light at an epileptic. Can't do it. Let's get it on. Bulger. Bulger, give me the ball! Earth to Tommy. Wake up, you lazy bastard. Come on! - Dude, you should have this party on Saturday. - No. Kate and Dan are at breaking point. I'm telling you. You can put that six year boner to some use. Don't say anything! Just think about it. You're a legend, Tom. - Shoot it, Tom. - Shoot it, come on! Come on! Oh! Wait, wait, wait. Vinny. Richie. Bulger. - Holy shit. It's on. - It's on. - It's actually happening? - Yep. Oh, my God. This is amazing. - There'll be cake and everything, Bulger. - Whatever. Tom, are we doing presents? You know I don't do that sort of thing. You, Kate. You, Kate. What did I tell you about wearing those boots in school? - Not to. - Not to. Footwear is supposed to be black or brown. - How's it a uniform if there's a choice? - This isn't a conversation. I'm not asking you. What are you now? Emo, is it? And you're going to dye you hair pink next, and put a ear-ring in your nose. And then there'll be the drugs. And five years down the line... you're in a bedsit by yourself eating your own hair. Oh, it's funny. Laugh it up. That tickled you, did it? 4a, Four o'clock, detained. I'll be in to check on you. You're not laughing now, and here. If I catch you with those boots in here again, it'll be a letter home to your mammy. Hey! He's such an asshole. - Hi, Kate. - Oh, hi. - How're you doing? - I just got detention. Well, do you remember that time in Mrs. Burke's class when she gave us detention for laughing? I've got something for you. - You're having a party? - Yeah. I don't know about this Saturday yet. I might be going out. - Oh! Right, with friends? - Yeah, just some of the girls. Well, you can invite them to come, too, if you want. - I mean there's plenty of room. - Yeah? - Sure! - Okay, I'll say it to them and see. Oh, dress code for Saturday is smart casual, so I don't want to see those shoes, in my house. Or I'll be sending a letter home to your mammy. 7B, Mr. Cliffords, maths, yeah? - Yes, sir. - Chop chop, yeah? You litle fucker, you. - It was completely off-key. - Why are you still here? Jesus, I didn't mean to scare you, Tom. Looking very sharp. Any plans for the weekend? - None yet. - Are you gonna play that card? Well, we saw the event page. You invited everybody to come on My Face. No, I didn't do that. - Are you lying to me? - No. I can see it in your beady fucking posh eyes. You're lying to me, Tom. Me and the ATB will come to you house. And do you know who the ATB are? All the boys. All the fucking boys. Come on, Sarah. Give "Thomas the Tank Engine" his birthday present. - Birthday bashings. - Oh, you're okay, Tommy. See you Saturday, yeah? I bet you wouldn't even know how to kiss a girl. If you saw a girl's gash, you'd put a plaster on it. All right, man? What have been saying about my party? Spreading the word. You have 32 friends already. - I don't even know 32 people. - You will. Trust me. It's gonna be good. Yeah? HAPPY BIRTHDAY Enjoy your present -MOM xx Not the same shitty bike again. Bring on the chuck. Richard 'Stiches' Grindle "Everybody Happy" - Hey!

We've work to do. - Nice. - Okay, we get three hours to go. Let's get to work. - Relax. We just got in the door. Richie, where is the peanuts? You forgot them, didn't you? Huh, wait! Richie, shut up! Get you head in the game. Tom, this is easy. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. Richie, that needs to go higher. You have it arse ways. - Fuck off. - No, you fuck off, Richie. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. What are you doing? Here. Blow these up. Can someone cover up those bins? They look terrible. - Hey, did you get the crepe paper? - I bought skins. - You bought skins? - That what you meant? No, I meant crepe paper. But don't worry. It's only been his first party in like six years. Hey! - Good work! - Now all we need is some bodies.

You can practically see her thing. - There're lots of people here. - Yeah, it's deadly. - Is it? - Yeah. - Have you seen Kate? - No. Oh, my God, there she is. - Hey, what's going on? - She's too good for you, so. No, no. When she's had a few drinks, - I'm telling you... - Oh, whatever. Those blow job lips will be gagging for Mickey. Here, lads, group shot. Let me see those fuck faces. Bulger, that's a fuck face? Did you get the fairy lights? Oh God. Delete that. I've such a double chin. Fuck's sake, Tom. You need to relax, man. - Sorry. Relax. - Chill. It's time to party. Nice shot. I picked up a sniper and took all three of their heads off. Boom, boom, bomm, straight away. It was incredible. I'd never done that before. Straight up I ran down into the pit. And once I pick up the over shield, I jump on his head like three times. Assassinated him. It was incredible. - Hash cookie? - Oh, no, thanks. They give me the shits.

Oh, I missed you. - Oh, Kate, I missed you, too. - I meant with the drink. I can't stand him. He sits besides me in English classes. He's such a fucking idiot. And that pubic beard. He needs to shave. White socks with black shoes. I don't fucking think so. It ain't '92, aye? Oh, man, look. Here she is. Oh, she's so fucking hot. Look, look, look. Shake it, baby. Yeah. Shake it. - Working it! - Yeah, yeah. She's gonna get it tonight, I think. There's more a chance of me going on a diet. Seriously. Things are about to get romantic.

Hey, you want your picture taken? Yeah, yeah, you do. Come on. Just a little over this way. Okay? Yeah. Nice. - He's taking her picture. - Oh, I see. - How are we? - Hi, Dan. Thanks for coming. Wouldn't have missed this. Would not have missed it. Nice um... decorations. Quite a little shindig you got here. You pulled out all the stops, didn't you? - Well done! - Yeah. Yeah. Oh, look. There are some of your friends over there. - Do you want me to go? - No, no, no, no. Don't be silly! Yeah, Tom. Don't be silly, Tom! You don't have to go. - Don't be silly. - All right. I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Ha, ha. I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Ha, ha. - Look at the face on him. - It's only Paul, you dope. - I'm gonna kill you, Tommy boy. - Come on, you dick. Fuck off. Tom, are you okay? - Nice one, guys! - Not our fault, he can't take a joke. I'll slap that smile off your face, you knacker bitch. Fight! Fight! Fight! Oh babe, come over here. We'll have a bit of a cat fight. OMG, little pussy. - Babe, you're just a pigeon in a tacky frock. - Bitch, I don't wanna talk to you, poodle face. Babe, you're easier to get into than community college, so just leave. - Fuck you. - Fuck you, Sarah. Oh, wait, the whole party already has. That's enough, Bulger. You and the prick just leave because no one likes you. - Where's the first aid kit? - In the pantry. You have a pantry? I'm on it. Tom! He went that way, love. Hey, Kate! Where did you put that bottle of vodka? Is it in your bag? Kate? All right, I'll see you later. Bingo. My favourite. Are you okay? - How's your head? - It's fine. Do you remember we used to come up here? Oh, this is the crows nest. Do you still use it? - Tom, what the fuck? - What? Why is the telescope pointing at my house? - Pervert! - No. I was up here the other night, looking at the graveyard, and I saw your light come on. And... I turned the telescope around and I saw you in your room. You were a bit mad about something. You were wearing clothes anyway. That's all I saw. I swear. Why were you looking at the graveyard in the first place? Open up before I fucking piss in clown pants. Fuck's sake! - Go upstairs, you clown. - Fuck you. Yeah, I know how this sounds, but the night of Stitches's funeral I went to the graveyard, and I saw this ancient ritual thing in the clown crypt. It really freaked me out. You think I'm nuts, don't you? - No. - Anyway, I'm... I'm not a peeping Tom. I'm... I'm just a mental Tom. You're not the only one who's screwed up. All of us in that party turned out odd. Where's the fucking zip? No! Not again? No one would believe me, so I started researching everything on the clowns. I thought, maybe if I found something out about that ritual, I could prove that it happened. Clowns have been around for centuries. I've got stuff here on Mediaeval jesters. Pueblo Indian Delight Makers, ancient Egyptian rib tickling ceremonies, the Feast of Fools, the right of Osseous Humours... I... I never found anything. It was all in my head. What are these? When a person becomes a clown, they have to paint their face on an egg. They call it the Spiritus Singularum, the Uniqueness of Spirit. Nobody knows where the tradition comes from. But it's been around for as long as the clowns have. Paul. He just can't compete. She's with you. She feels sorry for him. That's all. Aw, tastes like piss. Is there any more? Up to your old tricks again, Paul? Who the fuck are you? Maybe this trick will jog your memory. Ah-hh! Ah! My fucking ear! You're a lucky boy, Paul. You've got a front row seat to my comeback show. Please. No, please. No. That doesn't sound good. You must have stuff hair in you throat. Allow me! Something. It wasn't a hair. It was a little fluffy bunny. - It was our fault he died. - It wasn't. And Tom, just for the record, not every party ends with a dead clown. This party is really kicking now. So, yeah, photography is your hobby, is it? Now, it's pretty much, kind of. I mean... You know... You can get some good results. - Come on, let me see. - I'm just trying to figure out where the lads are. - Great, come on! - Oh, okay! Yeah! Um, I really like this one. This one is... Yeah, that's of you. Uh... It's a nice picture, I guess. Hey, Kate. Kate! Oh, excuse me. What's your problem, pale face? My problem is you pulling that shit with Tommy, you ginger fuck. Oh! Fuck off. Okay. That boy needs to lighten up, all right? How is pissy pants anyway? Up in his layer crying, drying himself off? - It was a joke. He needs to get over that, all right? - It wasn't a very funny joke. It was pretty hilarious. Like, I... I was laughing. - Have you seen Paul floating around? - Your asshole boyfriend? - Oh... No! - No. Kate. Okay! If you really wanna get to me, you're gonna have to do better than slag Paul. But speaking of boyfriends, what lead singer are you sleeping with now-a-days? - Changes so often. - Keeping tabs, are you? Well, you know, it is difficult, though. It's... It's not a one man job. Speaking of jobs, I do hear you're more partial to the old blow jobs, yeah? - What? - How else would you acquire the name "Blow Job Kate"? Fuck! Sniff them out. Goodbye, Funny Bones. Look's like you've eaten too much, fatso. Paul, you dick. I'm not Paul. He had to head off. Let's see if we can find a room in there for desert. Oh, Jesus. Help!

Anyway, tell me something about you. I can make a girl's nipples hard without touching. - Bet you five quid. - What's going on out here? He said he could make my nipples hard without touching. He's not messing. I've seen him practice on Bulger's moobs. Okay, I need to concentrate. - Vinny! - Worth every penny. Oh my God! I hate you. Vinny! - For fuck's sake, you little prick. - Fuck! Vinny! Vinny. A love for a perfect pair, a dick and a cunt. Oh, Vinny, you dickhead. Paul! Paul? Paul, is that you? Are you trying to be funny? This clown's not funny. Not anymore. Pick up the phone, Vinny. Brace yourself. Here it comes. Bastard. Taken from behind. Sniff them out. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. - Guys! - What? You need to get out of here right now! There's a clown who is dead. Not dead. He died and he came back, and he's in my house right now! You need to get out of here! - Clown? - You're a fucking clown. No, I'm not joking. We need to go right now. - Oh my God, you are being serious. - No, piss off. - Vinny! - Vinny! - Vinny, I love you. - Tom, what the fuck? - You need to get out of the house right now! It's not safe. - What are you talking about? The clown's back, Vinny. Look, you need to get everybody together. Get dressed and get out of there. Will you calm down. It's okay. I'll be out in about five minutes. It's not safe, Vinny. We have to go right now! - Shut up for a second, please. - Six minutes. - He's ready for you, Vinny. Just get him! - Listen to me! - Come on, go for it. - I need you, man. - Oh! - O... Oh. - Are you in there! He's ready for you, Vinny. - He want's you so badly. He said he'll give you a hand job for a fiver. - Vinny! - Just tell him you love him. Let's see how many lives you've got left. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Uh! Dead. - Kate, it's Stiches. - What are you talking about? - The clown from my party, he's back. - That clown died at your party. - No, I'm being serious. - Tom, it's Paul dressed up. It's not Paul. I know what I saw. Come on! - Tommy, no. - Hey, fuck off. Guys, there's a killer in the house! - Vinny's upstair. He needs our help. - Help him get it up. Help! Has anyone seen Paul, Richie or Bulger? - So do you wanna go upstairs? - No. I don't want to encourage this shit. No, I mean do you want to go upstairs? Don't worry about her, man. She doesn't know a winner when she sees one. Chicks. Love you, see you. Vinny? Prick. We have to go, now! Vinny, the clown is back. If you don't come with me now, he could kill us. - We need to get out of here. - I'm trying to bang this chick. Oh, Vinny, tell the little prick to piss off! You don't look happy to see me. I know what'll cheer you up. - I saw him upstairs. You have to come with me now. - Vinny. Vinny. Yeah, I'll be back in two minutes. Can you tell what it is yet? Woof. Woof. Dickhead! Say cheese. Oh, that's not my best side. - What's happening to me? - Stop talking, big head. Let's get the fuck out of here. Babe, put your knickers on. We're leaving. Vinny! Vinny! Mary, come on. There's a killer clown in the house. Is there? I'd like to meet him. Sounds like a fun guy. You are 16, right? I don't want to go to prison. Long time no see. - Bastard! - Step on his head! Oh, for fuck's sake. Vinny. I'm not leaving here without Kate and the others. Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. Where are you? Right, where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are. Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. - Come on. - No. - Come on. - No. - Toughen up. - No. Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. Here, Tommy, Tommy. Here, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. Here, Tommy, Tommy... We'll be okay in the crowd. He's not going to attack us in front of everyone. Okay? Okay! For fuck's sake. What the... Whoa! - Whoa, whoa! Where do you think you're going? - Get out of my way, you wanker. You're so fucking sued. My dad's a lawyer. Richie! Richie! Richie! Oh! Oh my God! Why are you screaming, chunky? You clearly got the stomach for it. Everybody happy? Kate! - We have to... - Go! Hey, blow job, Kate, get your mouth around this. Vinny, Kate! Kate! - Kate, wake up! - Kiss her, Tom. Now's your chance. Kate! Come on! Déjà-motherfucking-vu. Where do you think you're going? - Where are we going? - To the graveyard. Stiches egg. If we can find it and break it, I think we can kill him. We-e-e-e... You little bastard! Oh, for fuck's sake. Come on. Hurry up. - Hiccup. - Shh! Hiccup. I can't stop it. Where are you? Where are you? Let's go. Okay. One of us needs to stand guard. Now when you get inside, you'll see this big shelves with the hundreds of eggs on them. - Tom... - Stitches's egg has his face on it. - Tom, I don't know what's in there. Just go. - Yes. Looks like there's a party at my house. Where are you? Tom, righty tighty, lefty loosey. Happy birthday, Tommy. It's time to cut the cake. Now which is funnier... the look on your face watching her die... or the look on her face watching you die? How about we flip a coin? Heads it's me. Tails it's her. That's really sick, Tom. I like it. Well, fuck me sideways. I never... I never thought I'd end up with egg on my face. 6 MONTHS LATER - What is it? - Open it. It's a moving house gift. - We're only moving down the road. - Just open it. I just figured, you'll need a stronger lens if you wanna keep an eye on me. - Not that you're in to that sort of thing, of course. - Oh, yeah. Steady. Steady. Steady. Yes. Yes! Yes! Everybody happy?
