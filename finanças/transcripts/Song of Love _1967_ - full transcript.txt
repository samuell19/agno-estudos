Nobuko! What're you doing, Nobuko?! Let's go! "I went to the market hoping to find a first rate dresser. "I pulled the first drawer, from the outside." "I pulled the second drawer, too." "I even pulled the third one and the fourth one." "I pulled them from the outside." "Match." "Memo." "Memo." Let's go, Fumiko. "Match." "Memo." Fumiko. And then? Four times three is twelve. Four times four is sixteen, right? Four times four is sixteen. Four times five is twenty. Four times six is twenty-four. Good morning! Three times four is twelve, right? Nobuko, make sure you answer the teaches when he asks, okay? Yeah! Carry me, sis! Carry me! Come on. Doc, get yer glasses fixed at Tengando when yer done makin' the rounds. Folks is gon' make fun if yer wearin' those! Lessee, what else… Gotcher tie on proper? Hey, yer wallet! Ye'd forget yer head if it weren't screwed on! Yer wallet! Doc, yer wallet! Sheesh… And why're ya wearin' boots in this weather? Don'tcha think ya oughta be wearin' somefin lighter? Don't come whinin' ta me if the kids call ya a fancy lad again! Heeey! Waaait! Yer lunch! Doc, yer lunch! Ya forgot yer lunch! Lunch! Here. Wait for meee! He wants to get on? Cap, we leavin'? We gotta wait for the quack. You see him? Yeah. Hey, don't get too friendly with Haruko. Ryuta's gonna whoop ya. Hey now! Doctor! Someone spilled some oil on the pier. Watch out, 'kay? There! Right there! Watch it! Stand-by, Kiyoshi. Sir! Sorry, captain. Got an emergency over in Niihama. Oh yeah? Doctor! Just leave it there. Okay! Thanks! Hey!! Geez, no one asked for no damn concert! Full speed ahead! I'm tellin' ya it was wild! So how was Osaka? Too many people, too many cars… It stinks, I tell ya! D'you go up Tsutentaku? Oh yeah. Just some big tower is all. What about Osaka Castle? Sure. Sennichimae, Dotonbori… You name it! Did'ya see Kontora? The hell's a Kontora? Famous guy from Osaka, Torakichi Kondo. Six foot tall round face small eyes bald spot. Ya'd know if ya saw 'im! Dunno. Ya didn't, then? Tellin' ya, didn't see no guy like that. Maybe he died… Such a nice fella, too. Yo Bingoya, heard you had quite a time in Osaka! Those Osaka strippers all they cracked up to be? Will you shut up!! What's so funny, Haruko? Osaka's boring, huh? You're laughing now but Ryuta's still in Kobe, right? You're not worried? After all he's a man, and there's a lot of cabarets in Kobe… Oh no need to worry for her. Got a letter here for Haru. "I'll be back the morning after next." So… Mailman! Yes? You can't just go around readin' other folks' mail! I can't? No way! It's illegal! Got a right mind to report ya to the cops. Git outta here, ya slime! Uh… Bingoya, wait up! I'm sorry! Forgive me! No way buddy. He mailed this on the 13th, so that means he's coming home today. Said he'd be home in four or five days, tho. Fool. Kiyoshi! Water's hittin' the keel. Starboard, starboard! Full steam ahead! Full steam ahead!! So you plan on telling Haruko? What if she cries? I think you're making a mistake. I mean, if yer not tellin' the old man it'd be better to not tell Haruko either. Welcome home! Where were you? Dad was worried. Later, Ryuta! Were you with Jiro? Yeah. Got ya some senbei. Gone for an entire week… Hope ya had fun. Haruko's been worried sick. Jiro's cousin couldn't put us up any longer, so… You still hangin' around with that deadbeat? What's with you lately? It's like yer barely here. Got yer head in the clouds all day… What is it? Don't tell me yer thinkin' about Brazil again or some stupid shit like that? Haruko, come listen to this. If that's really what's goin on I'mma smack it right outta that big head of ya! Y'know back in the day, my dad used to kick my ass until I was 30! Well that was then, and this is now. If yer pop had smacked those cheeks of ya more often when he was alive I wouldn't have to put up with ya talkin' back to me like that, Haruko. What are YOU laughin' at?! Will you turn that thing off?! Take it easy, general. Ryuta's gotta spread his wings from time to time. We all just wanna hang onto our youth some way or another. Had a big fight with my pops when I said I wanted to be a seaman when I was 25. A man of the seas, huh? And that thing there's your mighty vessel, huh? I see, I see. What're you tryin' to say? It's a miracle you stay afloat. That thing ain't a boat, it's a big bath toy. One bite from the sillago fish and that thing is goin' under! Oh shaddap! If it weren't for that "toy" we wouldn't be able to go anywhere. Wastin' yer life away on this island like a grub stuck in shit. Better'n boarding that floater! Sure, why try 'n board anything?! Boats, cars… women! What're ya sayin', you bastard?! What's wrong? Anything happen in Kobe? I… I think I'm going to Brazil after all. That's why me and Jiro went to Kobe. To arrange everything. Passport. Emigration permit. Proof of vaccination. I'm sorry for not telling you before, Haru. Ah, doc. They're upstairs right now. Haruko and Ryuta. Why'm I tellin' you? They're old enough, so y'know. Last year when you came back 'cause the factory in Osaka closed we talked and father got so mad, saying over his dead body and such… So I thought Brazil wasn't an option anymore, right? Remember? Dad just… Won't allow me to live my life. So full of himself, thinks he knows best for everyone… I wanna be my own person! But… I just can't be honest with him. It's tearing me apart. So please, understand. Just once in my life, I need to do something for myself. All my life I've put myself aside so I can look after my pigheaded father… What about… us? Three… No, two years, and I'll come back. That should be plenty of time for me to find myself… They value people with skills there. You can really be someone. My sisters are still in grade school for the next three years. That's… Someone else is gonna have to look out for 'em until then. Are you willing to give up their affection that easily? What do you want from me?! What do I want… What do YOU want from ME?! Doc. What do ya think? Those kids gon' be alright without me? Sure, Ryuta's alright now, but he can't keep up this game of coming and going as he pleases… Fixing a busted TV here and there… That ain't gonna pay the bills. You're right, Mr. Senzo. Hit the nail on the head. Ryuta? Why? Why didn't you tell me earlier? Haru. I gotta do this. Please, you've gotta let me go! Please don't go! Turn that damn thing off! Where are you off to this time?! Thursday, March 10th. The skies cleared up after a night of downfall. That evening, Haruko brought her sisters over for their bath. The expression on her face was lifeless, and troubled. She looked helpless. Doc? Do you intend to always live on this island? Yeah. Always? Yup. I like it here! Did you always feel this way? I ran away to the countryside as soon as I got out of school. I'm not cut out for city life. Hate it. Some folk just wanna hide from the world. Hey no need to put it like th-- Yeow! Sis, come wash Fumiko. Coming. Excuse me. If it's too hot add some cold water. Okay. Dammit. Lousy stinkin' barber! I got places to be, dangit! General, please, lemme at least-- Idiot! Leave it! Guess he's got a hot date, huh? Who do you think he's shackin' up with? Bet it's that widow from the Kankai Inn. The chubby one with the big eyes. Right, Ryuta? No idea! I seee, Hatsu? Now there's a damn fine woman. Sure got pretty skin. Soft like rice cakes. Rice cakes? How so? Not just fluffy, but the kind that sorta sticks to ya. Oh you've massaged her, right? That's just business! Where do you… Huh? Git! Ah, got a delivery. Ryuta not here? Mr. Ryuta. Man I am parched. Think I can get a coke? Sure. Captain. Drinkin' too much coke's not good for yer thing, right? I mean, 's not like the mailman's got a wife to please, so… Guess I better quit. Senzo's off, huh? Should be interesting to hear what excuse he comes up with. Ryuta, I'm goin' out for a bit, 'kay? What was it? Oh yeah, think I'll visit the Yoshizos in Nishihama. Oh yeah! Gonna go check on the oranges on the way back, too. Maybe I'll even go for a walk in the mountains. Yeah. Anyway, be back soon. Safe travels. Who said that? Was it you? No no. What're ya wishin' me safe travels for? I'm just goin' out for a stroll. What? Man my age can't be goin' on no walks anymore without it being a thing?! I get it already. Do you, Bingoya?! You wanna start some shit, buster? Calm down… What, you want a piece of me? Father, no one is trying to start any trouble. You're just going out because you've got stuff to do, right? Yes. You're right, Haruko. Who cares what others think, right? I'll be back at 6. Okay, have fun. Ryuta. If the Mikawa guy comes, order 2 bottles of second-grade alcohol. Should be 800 Yen. Right. And if not ya haggle it down to 800, okay? Okay already. Don't forget because I can tell yer spacin' out. I won't forget! I'm not a child, once is enough! 800 bottles of second-grade alcohol from the Mikawa guy. 800 BOTTLES?! Dumbass! You think I'm tryin' to line the walls with booze?! 800 bottles… Dumbass! This is why I'm asking ya to pay attention, okay?! Two bottles of… Hey! Turn that thing off, idiot. Fine. Fend for yourself. Guys like you, yer a lost cause… Dumbass. Outta my way! Talk big… Take a look in the mirror! Running off to some floozy. Ryuta. Don't talk like that. Hasn't yer pops made enough sacrifices? He's been a widower for 15 years now. It ain't easy livin' that kinda life, y'know. Papa! Huh? I've been waiting! Hey! Don't be so obvious! That postcard… It's about the boat to Brazil, right? Yeah. If you're setting sail on the 18th, that's tomorrow! Are you leaving from Kobe? Probably. I dunno! Jiro. I'm… I don't think I can do this. It's not my pops. I don't care what he says. But Haruko is… She's… been looking forward to being with me. Providing for her baby sisters. It's been rough on her. If I don't look after her… Where is this comin' from?! If you miss tonight's train you won't make it. Room & board in Sao Paulo's already set. What are you gonna tell immigration? "I wanna be with my woman" ain't gonna cut it. I thought you said you were gonna break up with her? You're the one who asked me along, and now you're talking like this?! Good grief, the exhaustion really sets in after the 7th trip. Haruko, booze. Huh, you alone today? Where's the general? You think it's a good idea to open up shop without the old sourpuss? Huh? I guess! Sorry. You okay? Hey player, you grabbin' a bite? Ramen. Is dinner ready yet, sis? I'll get started right away. Sis! Please take this. It's a parting gift. If you get 730 boat, you'll be able to make the 905 express train to Yanai. That way you'll arrive in Kobe around noon. But you've gotta start packing now. You can't back out now after all the trouble you went to. What are you talking about? Isn't it a bit late for this? I thought you didn't want me to go? So I decided not to go. It's too late to force it now. Let it go. I've been thinking about it all day. Don't give up your dream for me. I don't want that kind of resentment. I'll help you get ready. You'll need fresh underwear, and what else? A backpack? Hey now. Don't you think you'll regret this? I can't leave this place. Find another who will treat you well. It's better for both of us if I stay. Hey. Do you mean that? Don't lose sight of your dream. Just go. Pops ain't back yet, so it's best to go now… You don't have much time left. Oh, Haruko. How come you're still here? Shouldn't you be feeding your sisters? Yes, you're right. Better go then. Ryuta not here? No. Well let's go together then. Nobuko burnt her food. Poor kid. Haruko. What's wrong? Doc. Ryuta's leaving for Brazil. So please wait… I wanna stay here until father gets back at least. I don't want him to find out about Ryuta… Hold on now. I don't know what's going on here, but… Running off on your folks, that's… What're you guys thinking?! Why aren't you stopping him? Why are you spacing off here like this? Ryuta? Ryuta! Ryuta wanted to cancel his plans for me. But doc… Maybe, just maybe… If we got married, had kids, and stayed here for the next 40 years… How would Ryuta feel about having lived such a normal, boring life? "Where would I be now if Haruko had just let me go back then…" What if he's stuck feeling that kind of regret? I can't allow let that happen! I just can't! You're wrong, Haruko. You'll grow old and laugh thinking back on this. You'll have kids and be so happy you'll never even think about regrets. Haruko. Don't let him go! Doc, please… I just don't know what to do… Haruko. Please don't stop him! Doc. Ryuta! Hey. Haruko. Take this. Hey, Ryuta! You here?! Doc. Go out the back. Now. W-wait! Wait! Doc, that you? Ryuta not here? Oh. You still here, Haruko? Haruko. Were you 'n Ryuta makin' up in the back just now? Don't gotta hide it from me. I know what's up. Okay? So no use in hiding it. Mr. Senzo, you're soused! What should I-- Hey, Hatsu? That's my daughter-in-law. Ain't she a looker? I'll introduce ya to Ryuta, too. You know Ryuta? I don't! Is he the local ladies man? Hahaha! A ladies man? Ryuta's my boy! Hey Ryuta, you here? Ryuta and Haruko are-- Doc! Please! Alright alright. I know what's goin' on. Just cuz I'm old don't mean I'm blind! Right, Haruko? Mr. Senzo--! Quiet! You quack! Haruko, c'mere for a sec. Got somethin' I wanna talk to ya about. Okay? Ever since I took ya in you've not been a burden to me once. Yer basically the perfect daughter-in-law. Me 'n her wanna rent a small place of our own nearby. Early retirement, y'know? You know? Anyway, that's how it is. And that's where I need you. Nothing's been decided yet tho. My wife, may she rest in peace, she took ya in her arms and said "Haruko, please be a good wife to my boy." You just blinked, and nodded yer head all serious. And we all laughed! Yer dad was there too, right? D'you remember? That's right… Ten years… No, more like 15 years… What's wrong? Haruko! March 24th, clear skies, Spring is here. Orin ordered me to dress lighter. It's been 40 days since Ryuta left the island. Not a word from him. Okay take care. - Watch your step, folks. Come, Fumiko. Wanna thank all of ya for traveling with us and I hope to not see you again until your honeymoon! Bye bye! Phoo! I am pooped. General, ramune me. Sheesh, think you can run a shop with that attitude? Oh yeah, what does it get you? Losin' a lotta business to the ferry, ain'tcha?! Gonna fit the old girl with a big, 30 horsepower screw while it's docked, tho. Don't let those hydrofoil ships beat ya! Heard that if you take 'er out and the screw's too big ship's gonna be stuck, goin' in circles! Hmph! See if I care about the words of a no-talent barber and some perverted masseur. Guess we're not good enough for mister luxury liner here. Cap, where ya off to next? Europe? Shaddup! Phew, hot one today, huh? Yeah, southern wind. The Soft Drink Association Newspaper? That's all it says? Yeah. Hey, where do you get off comin' in here and reading a guy's paper? Dumbass. Guess I'll wait another day for him to come Well, see ya. Hey. What's that supposed to mean? That song. You sayin' I'm waiting for something? It wasn't about you. But it's funny seein' y'all stick yer heads out whenever the mail gets here. Dumbass! We're doin' no such thing! So… you aren't waiting for the mail? Whatever, I gotta get to work. Put the ramune on my tab. Stay safe, cap! Hey, captain. Soon as that boat of yours sinks I'll be there to gather the parts. Now get outta here! I feel for Haruko. Having to put up with these lowlifes. Bye bye, Fumiko. Do you have cola? Three please. Grampa, cider. This is shochu, kid. Hey there. Mr. Senzo. No news from Ryuta? You on the sauce again? Keep it up if you want an early grave. That'd make Ryuta glad, I'm sure. Bingo. Soon as I'm gone he'll come back 'n throw a big party, with a big cake for everyone! Lousy… He should've arrived in Sao Paulo by now, though… If I get a letter from a guy like that I'll light it on fire and use it to heat my bath without even looking! Treating your folks this way… I gotta take a leak. You shouldn't get so worked up. Bad for your liver. And that sake is gonna make things worse before it gets better. Please keep telling him, doctor. I'm worried… It's 'cause of Ryuta. If he'd just send a letter it might make him cut back on the booze. I was walkin' past here the other night… And I saw a light burning inside so I took a peek. There he was, the general, with a bottle of shochu next to him. He'd put Ryuta's hat on it, like he was talking to the bottle. Looked so sad, I started tearing up… So cirrhosis of the liver is that bad, huh?! Guess I better keep an eye on my pee. They say your liver turns hard like stone, right? Yeah, gets so bad, can't even use a scalpel or any blade during surgery. So they gotta make a big opening in yer right flank and take it out with a saw and hammer 'n stuff. What's up, mailman? Ah, sorry, got another letter. I didn't realize because it's written left to right. Somewhere overseas. Doc, was that for real what ya just said? Lately if I push here on the side of my bellybutton… Kinda makes a weird "thump" noise, y'know? Right, better come get that checked. Thank you. You know I don't even drink or smoke. The wife left me three months ago, too, so I don't even-- Mailman! Quit yer whinin' and get outta here already! Father, there's a letter. Where from? Ryuta. That brat finally sent a letter, huh? Senzo. Stop being stubborn and read it already. None of your business what I do with this letter! Please, just read it. Alright already. Back it up, I can't read that. "To Mister Senzo Kamei" "Mister"? Okay, this looks like bath fuel to me. Sheesh. Gonna burn it, huh? What a relief, though. You coming with me to make some house calls, Fumiko? I'm glad Ryuta's okay, but what about Haruko? We can't let her get down. Doc, you've got a thing for Haruko, right? How about proposing to her? Don't be foolish! Honey! What are you doing? Throw those clippers out already! I'll do it now. I swear. Is Ryuta okay? That bastard. You should read some of the stuff he writes. Can I see? I dunno why you'd wanna read a letter from some nogoodnik who abandoned you… Okay, go ahead. Hey now. Just… Read it out loud, okay? Okay. "Dear…" "Dear"? What the hell. Getting all fancy… Dear my ass! Dumbass! Okay, go on. Can I get a coke? Nah. Some OJ then. Don't got it. What's that then? I SAID NO! Father! If you want a drink that bad go to your own house! Take it easy, pops. Get lost, dumbasses! Go on, Haruko. "Dear father, I hope you are doing well." "I am sorry for leaving without telling you." "Please forgive me." Bah. Nincompoop. Some nerve, that kid. Forgive him? Pshaw! Father, please don't. It's fine. Keep reading. "I arrived in Kobe on the 18th, and it's now been 35 days since I got to Santos." "It was a long boat trip, but I was able to make a new friend, and we danced together in the line-crossing ceremony--" You see, Haruko? Here I am, unable to sleep at night and this guy is off havin' the time of his life somewhere. I swear, this kid… Dumbass! Anyway, continue. "As for Sao Paulo, it is located on the exact opposite side of the planet." "If I were to dig a hole right beneath the chair I'm on now I might end up in Hinagajima." So then, that means Ryuta's… … this way? I think so! So he's walking around below us, his feet facing ours… ? Yeah! That's so typical of him! Y'know? Opposing me by literally standing in the opposite direction all day… "Sao Paulo is a real metropolis." "There are about 400,000 Japanese people here." "The manager of the penson I'm staying at is Japanese, too." "A penson is a Portuguese word meaning boardinghouse--" There it is! Portugal?! He told you he was going to Brazil, didn't he?! And suddenly he's in Portugal? Liar! No, they actually speak Portuguese in Brazil. No they don't, people in Brazil speak Brazilian! Actually Brazilian IS Portuguese. Why? Why? … Anyway, keep reading. Where was I… You keep interrupting me so I lose track. The stuff about the penpen in Portugal. Ah, yes. "I share a room with three other people." "Another Japanese, an Italian, and a German." "I've picked up some Italian, too." "'Bongiorno,' which means 'hello'." Oh, he's talkin' Italian, huh? Well, he's always been good at languages. Was gonna go to the University of Tokyo, but I made him give that up. Yeah… Hey now, don't go reading ahead without me. Ummm… "Starting tomorrow I'll be working at Doutor Cesario Ikeda's iron foundry together with one of Kimura's relatives, who came here with me." "Doutor is Portuguese for doctor." Well if he's working for a doctor… "I just got here so I'm pretty exhausted." "I feel like I could drift off at any moment." "The food here is pretty greasy, so it's given me the runs." Forgot to bring yer meds, huh… "I'm going to bed now." "It's dark over here, so I assume it's still day over in Japan." "It's a surreal feeling, and fills me with sadness." "I guess I'm just tired." "Anyway, say hi to the doc, Bingoya, Gohei, and--" "And Haru, too." Guess he hasn't forgotten about you after all. "I hope everyone takes care of themselves and I'll be praying dad stays in good health, too." "Good bye." "From Ryuta to father." From Ryuta… "Father," huh? "P.S. Don't drink too much." Aren't you relieved, father? Ryuta seems well… Nincompoop! Making us worry for nothin'. Where did you come from Where did you go Right about now… Mr. Hanshichi Senzo came home drunk as a skunk that night. Overjoyed, knowing Ryuta was safe. God dammit! Opposite of the Earth, huh? Not much I can do iz dere?! Y'know it's morning over there now! Bet that guy's wakin' up in his penpen villa right about now… Getting ready to work for that Doctor Daughter fella… Hey, granny. Didya know that right now below us everyone's standin' upside down?! Ya mean facin' the other way? Nah I mean their heads are down and their feet are up!! Oh my, that sounds bad for ya. Hey, Haruko. Yes? I broke my glasses, see? Ah, sorry. Could you write a letter for me? To Ryuta, right? What should I write? Write whatever! Dear sir, sorry for not staying in touch, yada yada yada. That's kinda weird. Why? Well, it's Ryuta who hasn't kept in touch. Oh yeah, yer right! That kid will be the death of me! Tell 'im if this was back in my day he'd get disowned! That's a bit much. What then? Hmm. Dear Ryuta, thank you for writing. "Dear"? "Thank you"? Why should I be thanking him? Okay then, how about just "We've read your letter." We did? Shit! Fine. Just write. Tell 'im just two or three pages ain't gonna cut it! Yeah. Tell 'im he's gotta write at least ten or twenty pages next time! Ryuta! Getting kinda carried away lately, huh? Dancin' the night away… Don't you know how worried we've been about ya?! You should see how pale Haruko's gotten these days. Ain't even eating properly! She's been having chest trouble, too. What're ya gonna do if she starts coughin' up blood and dies?! We shouldn't write that, it'll only worry him. Then what do we write? What about we just write about your day to day? I'm sure Ryuta misses the island. Nothing happens here that's worth writing about. For example. Yeah… How about this? I was finally able to spend some time at the doc's place tonight. What's the point in letting him know that? Ah well, just write. "Haruko and her sisters came along to take a bath, too." "Doing this it feels like you're gonna show up any second, too." How about this? Ya write good, kid. What else? "I can just picture you in that blue striped polo shirt, and straw hat." "The sound of your geta clacking… Telling a joke to make us laugh." "The doctor, Gohei, and Bingoya are all well." "So are Haruko and the kids." "Everyone is worried about you." "Even when you're on the other side of the world and our nights are days to you I'm sure you feel the same." Saturday July 10th. The end of the rainy season approaches. One of those days where you can really feel Summer has arrived. Hey, mailman! C'mere! What is it? You deliver any mail to Haruko lately? Well, that is what I do, being a mailman… What I'm askin' is: have there been any letters from Ryuta? Us mailmen aren't allowed to pry into private correspondences. But you see who's sending the mail, right? Well, it'd be hard not to. So you would know whether Haruko got a letter from Ryuta? I fear I cannot answer that, as it would be illegal for me to do so. Ah yes, of course. Too bad, tho. Was gonna treat ya to a cold one, but I guess I better not. Ah, just a second… Um… While I cannot answer your questions there's no rule keeping me from joining you for a little idle chit-chat… However, I do believe that vocalizing any response would be breaking the law. Oh? So you can respond to our questions without using your voice? You just need to pay close attention to my body. Please, ask me anything you like. Yer talkin' outta yer ass, mailman. Just tell me whether or not Haruko got a letter from Ryuta. Dumbo. She didn't? Look. Look. What about before? Not one letter? Didn't send a single god damn letter. Haruko, what's wrong? Haruko! Watch out! Haruko!! General, general! What? What is it? Haruko fell in the water! Quick, pull her up! Heeey! Haruko fell! Heeey! Heeey! Daaad! It was a little past noon when I received the news of Haruko. Thankfully she hadn't swallowed any water, so no harm was done. I saved her, y'know! Heeey, captain! The boat's wandering off! Did you not tie it down?! However, by examining her I noticed she was showing signs of pregnancy. Five months, if I had to guess. Dear lord, have mercy on this poor girl. Forgive her her sins. Amen. Haruko? Sorry… What are you doing h-- Come in, come in. Lotta skeeters here. Come inside. Come on. Phew. Can't say it's completely foolproof, though. Anyway. Actually pretty chilly tonight, huh? Doc. Yeah? Actually, I'm… About your condition? I wanted to tell you sooner, but… Yeah, I first noticed when I checked you this afternoon… Actually a little while ago I had this feeling that maybe… But I couldn't believe a proper girl like yourself would get herself in a situation like this. Ah, no, I don't mean it like that. Um… I'm sorry. I should've noticed sooner. We see each other you every day, so. Must've been hard dealing with this by yourself. The fact you're gonna be a mom, and all. I'm glad you've been keeping yourself together so well. I'm… I'm gonna raise it by myself. I don't wanna be a burden on anyone. Out of the question! I'll help you out, count on it. Please don't cry! No, let it all out… It's fine. Ah yeah, that's right…I'll get you something that'll help you sleep. Please stay put. The wind's cold at night. Here, take this, Haruko. Haruko? Hey. Hey. Hey. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Oh? What is it, granny? Ah, nothing. Never mind. Probably overthinkin' things. You have a fight with that quack? No… Oh dear, what a scare. You see a ghost or what? I can't say. I really can't. If you've got somethin' on yer mind then out with it. Don't crop things up. It'll just rot and poison ya. Yeah… Problem with your son? No. Got a man? Oh no. Hey, what are you saying?! Hey calm down. Here, drink this. You'll feel better. Yer fallin' apart, granny. What is this? Oh crap, I gave her shochu. Here, granny. Water. Anyone there? Coming! Such a cute face. And it's all a front… For the devil! Thank you, Kiyoshi. No, no, let him do it. You're in no state. Kiyoshi, use your legs! Fumiko, you wet the bed yesterday? Huh? You did?! That's no good. Where was yer sis? What?! Haruko spent the night at the doc's place? Keep it down, you! Hey, Orin. You old bat. What did you think you see? Get yer mind outta the gutter! You heard me! Tellin' me Haruko shackin' up with the doc? Better quit jokin' around. Don't matter how Christian y'are when it comes to that. Right, Bingoya? Plus the doc's got a thing for Haruko. Ain't been with a girl in a long time. Y'all are a hopeless bunch! Hey, Bingo! Listen up. He might not be good at what he does but he's a wonderful person. Yall are different species. You sayin' I'm no good? Yer okay. The doc's just not good at his job. Oh he's the one who's not good at his job? Hey. Whether it's his stamp collection or his coins or whatever, a loser don't sell himself cheap. Don't you lot understand even this much? Speak of the devil. What are you doing here, granny? Go hold down the fort, I got house calls to make. Ah, doc. Take five. Bingoya. Get the doc a ramune. 'kay. That old bat of yours been goin' off like a fool y'know? Tryin' to warn me about some bullshit. You silly woman. Said you 'n Haruko been shackin' up. What?! Granny… You had no right, you uncouth woman! You're right, doc. I dunno what to say… I am disgusted. Unforgivable! Mr. Senzo. I apologize on her behalf. I may be just a man, b-but… But Haruko's different. When it comes to Haruko… Doc, I'm tellin' ya don't get so worked up. Calm down. It's just some old bat's imagination. Dad, we gotta go. Oh shit! Oh, Haruko. C'mere. Mr. Senzo. Listen. I have to tell you something important. Huh? Look. I want to start taking care of Haruko. Taking care of her? How? Listen. Haruko's… Haruko is… Her condition requires assistance. She gotta go to the hospital? She got a heart disease? No, no. Haruko's in good health. But, as a girl… I'm saying that… I've concluded that things are going to get less pleasant for her. You knocked her up?! W-what?! I take offense to that! Who then if not you?! Haruko? Who-- Isn't it obvious?! Ryuta? My grandkid? You're home late, what's up? I just dunno what to do. Should I leave it all in the doc's hands? Sorry, Haruko. Sunday, April 10th. Haruko moves in with me. One suitcase. One futon. One desk. It's a beggarly move. That evening Orin and I pray for Haruko's delivery to go smoothly. She did it! She did it! What is it? A boy! Really?! It's a boy! It's a boy! Woooo! She did it! Dad, Haruko did it! She had a boy! January 1st. A precious new life. Living with us in this peaceful land. Sigh… What a year it's been. Rather than calling it a gift of God to us it's nothing short of a miracle. Grow strong and healthy, little bean. And you as well, mom. You are my world. Welcome home. Welcome back. Haruko. Senzo's getting worse. He's not too worried about his own urine sugar but we can't let our guard down. I brought some medicine. Thank you. Sorry for always imposing. Not at all. How is he holding up? Father. How are you? I dunno, think this is it. Right, pops? Yeah, yer a goner. We're all goners. You, me. Haruko. We're all goners one day. All we are, is dust in the wind. Oh don't be so dramatic. How's Ryusuke? He's taking a nap. I couldn't bring him. Mr. Senzo. If yer urine sugar's bad, ya can't do it no more neither, right? You talk like you know. I was relieved when I found out it was just my urine sugar. But I ain't old enough to be givin' up on that! It's definitely 'cause of old age, tho. Shaddup! D'you understand, Haruko? The boat's here, I gotta go help. You understand. Must be hard on the doc, too. Why's that? Bein' with a girl like that all day, not bein' able to do anything. Urine sugar? Dumbass! Ryuta. Why… Ryuta. The two of you can talk later. Hurry up and show your face to the old man. He's sick y'know. Haru. Later, 'kay? It might be too much for him, seeing his son's face all of a sudden. Hey Ryuta, wait. I see. Senzo might figure out we sent a telegram to get him here. Heard of a case in Kaminoseki once. Some old timer who had stomach cancer died from a heartattack after the family had gotten the son to show his face. Pretty similar to this. Oh no… This is getting complicated. What should we do… As for the telegram that was sent to Ryuta… Make sure to emphasize it was merely a coincidence. I see. Please, tell us how we should handle this. Leave it to me! General! I can't believe what I just saw! I'm dreaming with my eyes open! Don't you know… Your son… has returned home!! Look for yourself! Can you frikkin' believe it?! General. I know what it looks like, but I assure you we did not send for him It's almost like he knew… I see. So I really am a goner, huh? You'd make a lousy actor. Hey, mailman. I don't got time for this bullshit. If y'all sent him a telegram just tell it to me straight! Papa! Dad. You shouldn't jump to conclusions. A lot's happened, so I had to leave Sao Paulo. I guess I should've written, but… No joke? You think I'm lying? See?! See, the truth is… Papa-- Mailman! Get outta my sight!! Look Ryuta, the old man's back to his old self! Shut uuup! Sheesh, I'm sweating. Sick people sure are suspicious. Well, could've gone worse! Dumbass! Ryuta. You know about Haruko? Yeah, I heard some stuff on the boat. She's living with the doctor, right? What about you? Sayin' you didn't have a girl there? No way. Ryusuke ready yet? Coming. There he is, the big man. Nice 'n warm eh, little bud? Can I come in? I can't stay long. Sure. You all seem well. Yeah. I landed a job at a factory in Osaka. Got a friend there in Nishiyodogawa. You know Kitajima from Yanai, right? What about Brazil? There's suffering no matter where you go. Actually Japan's… Sao Paulo is a big city, kinda like Osaka. But it's harder when you can't express what's on your mind. Speaking of, Haru… You got a kid? Haru. I didn't stay in touch because I needed to forget about you. You understand, right? But… No matter what I did, as the boat approached Japan I just had to go back to the island. No matter… No matter how I tried to let go… Why did you… Haru… Why did you… ? Hey, mom. Can you come for a sec? Yes. It's okay, Haruko. I'll go. Didn't father say anything? We couldn't really talk. He has his reasons, too. But, you and the doctor… Hold on just a second! Gonna let yer mom powder yer butt, kay? Oh dear… I wondered who it was but I had no idea it could be Ryuta. I gotta go. Hey, wait. Haruko, you okay with this? Oh I don't even know anymore. You wait right there. Hold this kid. Hold him. That's it, that's it. Cute kid, huh? Feels good, huh? Bein' held by him? Granny. This kid… Don't tell me… Haru! Haruko, you… Why didn't you tell him anything? Why… Why didn't you let me know? I'd been meaning to… Then why didn't-- Because I thought I shouldn't! If I told you… Could you have gone to Brazil? It's all you ever wanted. Ryuta. Welcome home. It's a lot to take in, huh? Doc. This kid, I… Yeah. You didn't know, right? I felt bad for Haruko, so I took them both in. Cute kid, huh? Get dressed, yer gonna catch a cold! Haru. Please, tell me. Hugging my kid… I realized-- Y'know, Haru? That's right, Haruko. Don't hold back now. Definitely not on account of me. I know better than anyone else how you feel. That's right, Haru! I misunderstood. Don't be mad. I guess I got caught up in the rumors, about you and the doc… What was I thinking! Sorry, doc. No need to apologize to me… Doc, I got a job in Osaka. Brazil didn't work out, but it was a good experience so I don't regret it. Since I'll be in Osaka soon… Will you come with me, Haru? I wanna make up for everything. So if you and the kid would… Nobuko and Fumiko, too, one day… Living abroad for a year and a half has given me a lot of life experience. So you… Wanna take this kid with you? Of course. Why? Ah, that's… You wanna raise a kid in the big city? It's no walk in the park… I got this. It's my duty as a father. It's just… I consider him my boy, so-- Do you have that on paper? Well, I was gonna… It makes sense for him to be with us. Now that Haru and I are reunited. Ryuta, don't talk like that. Why not… Am I wrong? I… I knew this day would come. Ever since the kid was born I knew you would show up one day, and say the things you're saying now. How about it, Ryuta? Can you let me have the kid? Let you? Doc. Are you serious? I love him. I raised him like my own flesh and blood. I bathed him. I carried him on my back. Haru, are you capable of leaving the kid? Of course not! Haruko. Please consider my-- You don't have the right, doc. I'm the boy's father. Ryuta, that's-- Where do you stand on this?! Ryuta. You need to back off. Mr. Senzo, weren't you sleeping? YOUR kid? Where do you get off?! Father, please. You need to lie down. Ryuta. What do you want? Haruko? The kid? Haruko, right? You wanting the kid is that for real? But-- But-- It's my kid! Right, Haru? Well, yeah. I just don't know anymore. Why? It's simple. Don't you get what Haruko's sayin'? The only thing you did was put a baby in her belly. A dog or a horse can do that shit. Thinkin' he's a father 'cause he had sex once. What are you saying, dad? Don't I have a right, as a father? Do you really wanna be a dad?! Abandoning a pregnant wife, runnin' off to Brazil… You don't know what it means to be a parent. Shit for brains! Come waltzin' back here all "Yo doc, hand me my kid." Mister worldwide over here… No son of mine would act like that! What am I supposed to do, then? Enough. Enough, Mr. Senzo. I'm at fault here. Oh, how's that?! I only see one bad apple here. There's no helping this dumbass… Even tho' I was on the other side of the world, I never forgot about you, dad. Yer all talk. All I see is lips flappin'. Is that how you talk to the son you haven't seen in over a year?! Zip it! You're no son of mine!! Father, stop! Ryuta. Where are you-- Let him go! I feel sorry for Ryuta… Oh yeah, feel sorry for him. What about me? Or Haruko? You leaving? He's such a cheerful kid, y'know? Every morning when sees my face he's got a smile, ear to ear. He looks so much like you. You can really tell he's yours. I kept thinking about you in my penson bed in Sao Paulo. But the only one who would ever show up in my dreams was dad. I ran as far away from him as I could, but he was still able to find me. Whenever I saw him in my dreams… I'd wake up, my eyes red from all the tears. February 15th. Ryuta left like a thief in the night. Saturday, February 16th. A heavy wind reared its head. It was going to be a tepid day. Haruko! Boy we sure had a time of it last night. Senzo got dead drunk. We were stuck with him until dawn. Morning. Morning. He's still sleeping. No wonder after last night. Wonder if he's still breathing. Hah! Who knows? Don't be so casual about it! Give me a hand. Father! Senzo! Hey, general! Get yer ass outta bed already! I wonder where Hatsu is? I guess she got tired of Senzo's shouting and went back to the inn. That bad, huh? Father! Well I guess we're partly to blame. Can you believe that Ryuta, though? Here one day, gone the next. (Father, I'm going to Osaka and I won't be back. Please stay healthy. - Ryuta) Monday, February 18th. Today I say goodbye to my dear friend, Senzo Kamei. We don't know where Ryuta is. Hey! What? Still not burnin'? Not yet. Probably take another two to three hours. Really makin' us wait here. You put in enough oil? Yeah, loads. Shoulda been baked by now. So sad… He's just not ready to pass on. Unfinished business. No wonder, always flyin' off the handle! Wouldn't even give water to his son if he was dying of thirst! Lemme fill ya up. Welcome back. Sorry for not noticing. 's Okay. Doctor. I found out where Ryuta is. I got a letter just now… Where is it? That letter? Yes, hello? Hello? Long distance please. Ah, hello… Um… I was wondering if you could look up a number for me? Osaka, Nishiyodogawa, Mitejima 2-5. Matsumoto Construction. Yeah, Osaka, Nishiyodogawa, Mitejima 2-5. Please put me through as soon as you've got it. This is Murotsu 85. It's urgent. No, life or death. Okay? Life or death. Is… Is Ryuta okay? Yes. Good! He working… ? Yes, says it's going well. Good, good. I'm relieved. Happy you found him. Haruko. If the phone rings tell him you're bringing Ryusuke, and coming over. To live together. Doctor… Tell him his father died, and you want to see him, talk to him… Tell him you need him to comfort you. No matter what you gotta be with him. And if it's money you're worried about, I can help. You know, Haruko… Ever since Ryuta left that evening, tears in his eyes… I've been eating myself up, every day… Thinking "I'll legally adopt Ryusuke." "I raised him, so I have my rights." I thought Ryuta's claim was selfish. But when I think back on it all I can remember was how harsh Senzo had been. His heart was filled with feelings of wanting to see you, Ryuta and Ryusuke together as a family. There they all were, his son, daughter-in-law, and grandkid… Yet he said all that, just to defend me… Family is… How do I put it? Even though Senzo died, I can't help think he'd been too harsh that day. Ever since that day I've just been on edge. I really got in the way of you all. What was I thinking getting mixed up in all of it? Haruko. Raising a kid in the big city ain't gonna be easy. But you gotta get out there, experience how hard life is outside of the island. One day you'll be able to take Fumiko and Nobuko in, too. Please don't feel bad for me. Go, live your lives! It's Ryuta. He's calling. Yes? Yes. Okay. This is Tachibana in Murotsu. Is Ryuta there? Ryuta Kamei. Hello? Ryuta! It's me. Haruko! Saturday, March 10th. I'm seeing Haruko and Ryusuke off to live with Ryuta. I… Once we're settled we'll come visit father's grave. No rush. Whenever you can. Senzo'll be waiting. He's not gonna throw a fit from the grave. He'll be waiting here… forever. Doctor. Don't drink so much. It's fine, it's fine. Clear skies ahead for you and Ryuta! Right, Senzo? Drink up. Alright! Turn it up! Not so loud, geez! Haruko. Phew, I made it. This is warm milk, so don't let it go bad. Hey. Did you bring the, uh, you know? The thing… The travel documents? Yeah. It's in her bag. Haruko! Got ya a lil' something. Eat it on the train, 'kay? Thank you so much. Here, take this. Haruko, we're leaving. Nobuko. Fumiko. Listen to what the doctor says, okay? Doctor, please take care of my sisters. No worries. You just get on the boat. Okay, we gotta go or we'll be late. Kiyoshi, stop daydreaming. Untie the rope. You clumsy brat, this shit's getting old! C'mon, give him a hand. This is the wrong record. It's supposed to be a different one today, idiots! Cap, wait! Hey, did you hear me?! We should arrive in time for the 10 O'clock train. Here, Kiyoshi. Haruko, you good? Yes! Hey, Kiyoshi. Your hat! I'm kind of anxious, doctor. Just be careful, okay? Okay. Okay, Haruko? Ready to go? Kiyoshi! Full steam ahead! Everyone, thank you so much. Haruko! Be good, Haruko! Okay, play it! Stay safe, Haruko! Bye bye! Good bye, doctor! Siiiis! Bye bye!! Kiyoshi, you're heading in the wrong direction. But pop… We'll leave the Pacific if we go hard to starboard. Dumbass! Port! Port! Dipshit! Translated by Carlo V
