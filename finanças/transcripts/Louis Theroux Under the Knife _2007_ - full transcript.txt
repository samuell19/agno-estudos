OK. I'm gonna take you back, get your clothes changed then you'll meet Dr Amron. He'll mark your body. OK. He'll take photos. Yes. You walk into the operating room. You're awake when you go in. Yes. You're in great hands. Dr Amron does this all the time. He's excellent at what he does. It's like his forte! I was in Beverly Hills, about to have a plastic surgery operation. I've been meeting the people of southern California for whom looking their best involves regular trips to the surgeon. Wow! Look at that! Amazing what you can do with a bit of skin. You don't want to do the butt itself. Never do the butt. They claim that by changing our outer appearance, they can change our innermost feelings. There are not many guys who are 50 who look that good! And now I would be finding out first hand. Lisa? Come on back, honey. How are you? My journey began at the offices of Dr Stuart Linder, a Board-certified plastic surgeon whose life's work is creating perfect bodies for the women of America. What brings you in? What are you thinking about? I'm thinking about liposuction and boob implants. What do you think your breast size is? Probably a 36B. What size are you hoping to go to? Around a D. OK. A double D. That's quite big, isn't it? She's a tall lady. What's made you decide to do this? Um, I've always thought of it. Now I'm gonna be 30. I figure you only live once. Why not? Yeah. Let's take a look at you. Excellent. OK. Excellent. I'm gonna look away. You have a bit of skin laxity here. How are you feeling? Good. She's excited. She's gonna rock'n'roll. We'll have fun. How do you feel? I'm ready to roll, man! Come in. This is our consultants' office. These are just examples of some of the patients I've operated on. You operated on all the women in these pictures? Correct. And they're models, many of them? Yes. How do you feel looking at these beautiful women you've helped achieve augmented breasts? I am a perfectionist with breasts. Just as Picasso or Michelangelo, I'm a perfectionist. This is my life. And I want absolute perfection. So I go underneath the nipple, get the folds even, and the nipples in the correct position and place the implants perfectly every time. So it's not all God-given beauty. Some of it's Linder given. I do the best I can. Dr Linder brings a touch of Hollywood glamour to the everyday women who visit him. They come hoping that an improved figure will boost their confidence and maybe change their lives. Look at the difference in the shape. See the difference? Yeah. This is moderate. These would be outdated. The young lady has quite saggy breasts. It's what we call Grade three ptosis. This can only be corrected with a total breast lift. We do over 1,000 implants a year. That is my forte. OK? She's got beautiful creasing. One finger. Before they were really far out. Now they look like this without a bra. You're Adriana. I'm Adriana. What do you do here? I run his front office. I help him with the patients, as you saw before. And I help with the dressings and all that. I understand you recently had surgery on your tummy. A tummy tuck. A tummy tuck and re-did the breasts. What does the tummy look like? The tummy is now flat as a board. I'm so, so happy. I'm 26 years old. I had a little bulge going on right about here and I couldn't get rid of it with sit-ups or a personal trainer. He has magical hands and I've... How long ago did you get the tummy done? It's about 11 weeks. What is that mark down there? This is a full scar. Wow. It goes from hip to hip. But I'm OK with it. You have to give something to get a little back. It'll gradually go away? It takes about a year to heal. Let me see your tummy now. Does that mean he made you... He made a new belly button. A new belly button! I have a new belly button. Virgin again! Where's the old belly button gone? It came out with the skin. So he re-does the hole. A new hole right here. It's so smooth, isn't it? Yes. Do you want to touch? I can touch it? Go ahead. Wow! It's so smooth, Dr Linder. Thank you so much. It's so smooth I let him touch. So far, so good. Happy. She's doing well. You made a new belly button? What we do is make a new hole. Same belly button goes through the new position, through a new hole. That's considered standard in the United States. And I had lipo on the inner and outer thighs. Suits you. Yes. Is it a requirement of working here that you have a perfect body? Absolutely not! No. But it helps! What can I tell you? The area around Dr Linder's office is home to some of America's wealthiest and most adventurous plastic surgeons. If you're shopping for the perfect body, this is where you come. My next stop was with a specialist from Russia, Dr Nicholas Chugay. Well, hello! Hello. Are you Dr Chugay? I am Dr Chugay. How do you do? Nice to meet you. And you. What is your name? Louis. Louis, it's a pleasure. Shall we come in? Please, come in. This is my office. Yes. This is where I do my best work. Is it? Yes, talking to my patients. So what is it you do, Dr Chugay, if I may ask? Well, I do a lot of body-sculpting surgery. I'd say that's my specialty. Yes. Whether it's pectoral augmentation or gluteus enlargement, or calf enlargement. So for men that would be to give the impression of muscles here. The Schwarzenegger look. I would be curious. If I came to you and said I'd like to improve my appearance, could you make any suggestions? If you looked at me, what would you say? Without fear of hurting my feelings in any way. Probably I might reduce the nose, just a tiny bit. The projection of the nose. Even though you have a strong face, still it's a pretty strong nose. Just a tiny bit to reduce the projection of the nose. You have a nice strong jaw line. Your features are good features. What is it about the work that you enjoy? You could not like your nose, Have a big nose, and spend three years on the psychiatrist's couch. You'd come out maybe liking your nose better. I can do that in one hour and you'll like your nose better. So that's the magic of plastic surgery. A regular patient of Dr Chugay, named Steve Erhart, had come in for a check-up. Tell me a little about Steve. Well, Steve and I have known each other for - how many years, Steve? Um... Probably 15. Probably 15 years now. Steve has had quite a number of procedures done that I've done for him. We still see each other quite a bit. Are you comfortable showing off your physique, Steve? Certain parts! DR CHUGAY LAUGHS OK. Pectoral implants, biceps implants. Has all the work been done by Dr Chugay? Except for a couple of my very, very early surgeries, back in 1987. May I ask your age, Steve? I'm... I never talk about my age. But I'm approaching a half a century old. Quite remarkable. In a way, is it fair to say that Steve is kind of a creation of yours, Dr Chugay? That's right. It's a Pygmalion complex! It's a collaboration. It is. It truly is a collaboration. Looking at Steve, are you pleased with the results? Yes. Proud? Yes, I am. I think he's done well. He's aged well. Does the roundedness here, the slightly feminine cast of that, bother you at all? Well, they're not perfect, but they're there. Right? Right. Why have you done it? Small things bother me in a bigger way than they do most people. If there were bags under my eyes, I don't feel I could live with it. It would be difficult for me to live with it so just remove them and get on with it. My last appointment of the day was with Laura Noblin. An office equipment lease administrator, Laura had retained a 2,000-a-day image consultant named Eve Michaels. On Eve's recommendation, she was about to transform herself through a series of surgical procedures. She'll feel a lot more confident to wear it afterwards. Right? Yeah. Would you, Laura? Uh-huh. Would you like to wear this? Yeah, I like this look and everything. but right now, I'd have too much hanging out the bottom. Not bad. Not bad, not bad. But too tight like that. When all this comes in, and this in here, and this is smaller, it will drop down differently. Do you think you'll feel better after the surgery? Will I? Oh, yeah. I can't wait for that. Surgery. Why? I'll be able to wear all these clothes and they'll look perfect. They're not gonna catch. That'll make you feel better about yourself? Mm-hmm. Do you think? How do you know that? Because I just know. It's one of the reasons I want the brow lift because she looks a little stern. Have you noticed? A little quiet. Her energy's down. And when we lift up the brow, what you'll start seeing is someone with more of a "Wow" expression. What about... And then why the breasts, then? Confidence. Bigger breasts, more confidence? No. We don't want to focus on the size. We're doing bigger so that she doesn't have to wear a bra all the time. Right now, they're a bit saggy. She doesn't look good without a bra. But it's when she makes love. They're uneven. More than anything else, they... But you are making them a little bigger. Since we're gonna be there, why not? She's getting them lifted and we want to go a little fuller. Now she's paying, she can have her wish list. Oh! OK. OK. Instead of doing this, even with a push-up bra... May I? Yes. ..it's gonna be more like this. Up. Her cleavage will come high. Back at her apartment, I was curious about something Eve had told me had happened the night before that threw some light on Laura's decision to go under the knife. Am I right in thinking you've just split up from your boyfriend, Laura? Um, yeah, I've been with him about eight years off and on. We work together so it's been a challenging thing for me but I've just kind of had some conversations and I've realised, "You know what? It's been eight years. I'm ready to move on." And that just happened? Uh-huh. I need to take care of myself and move on. EVE APPLAUDS Why are you applauding that, Eve? Yay! I'm so proud of you! Yay! That was a big thing for Laura. It was a big step for her. Don't you start! OK. I was crying last night. I get too close. I love my clients. I want Laura to feel so fabulous with her... ..that no guy is the cause or the affirmation or the whatever of her self-esteem. That she is... That she loves herself so much, she feels so good about herself, that she will be the princess and you will have your prince. Any guy that doesn't see that beauty in her, next! What's that four-letter word? Next! Early the next day and I had a full schedule of operations to attend. First up, leading breast surgeon, Dr Linder. Is Dr Linder around? Yes, he is. He's in his office. Come on back. I need to get everything. First I'll get your breasts. Legs apart, arms out. Arms away from your side. Go ahead. Gown up. Ready. You're OK? Yeah. You look a little white. Do I? Yeah. Oh, my word. You're not gonna faint or anything? Do we have smelling salts for this guy? And we are starting. You can put the music up. Here we go. I'm injecting under the nipple. Then I'm going to inject some portions of the medial breast and under the inframammary fold here. Good. Excelente! Excelente! Bravo! Bravo! Implant... going... ..in. That's it? It's in. Marcaine is in. We're filling it up to 600. First breast done. How about that? What did it take? 15 minutes? Look at how beautiful this is. This is Playboy perfect. This is as natural and voluptuous as you can get. Look at that. Here's our second implant going in. 550. Filling it up to 600cc. Here's our Marcaine, which is an anaesthetic solution. New breasts. New Beverly Hills breasts. For you, that was another day in the office but what I saw was a patient who was... I don't know. It's a big thing, surgery. It's a life and death thing. That's why you have to make sure the doctors are the best taking care of you. And how was that for you? That was like water off a duck's back. You take every surgery as totally serious. It's all real surgery. But again, surgeons who are well-trained and do the same surgeries year after year, thousands and thousands do these operations just as a bricklayer lays bricks and a plumber fixes plumbing and pipe-fitters fit pipes, I do these surgeries. Do you think you might have just changed her life? Always. We always change lives. Upstairs, I wanted to speak to Dr Linder's receptionist, Adriana, about a rumour I'd heard. Is it true that you're thinking of having another procedure? Yes! Yes, I'm actually in the bookings for this coming Friday. I'm going in for some lipo on the flanks. Really? Yes. I don't think there's anything left on the flanks! There actually is. There's a little bulge right here. You can't do it with exercise too much. I'm gonna have that smoothed out so it's more like this. Let me see the other side. So just those two little... Yes, right there. ..two little love-handles. Yes, I want them gone. Why? Because I don't like them. They make me wonder about my... When I wear tight-fitted clothes, you see a little... You can't see them, though. I can. What matters is that I can see them. Not so much that anybody else can see them, I can and that's enough. You know they're there. Have you asked Bree's advice? About her liposuction? I actually do think she needs it. You do? Just a tiny bit on the side to even it out from her tummy tuck. Bree? Yes, Doctor. Bree's advice and Dr Linder's advice is that I do as much as I could on my own, to get better results. She's getting her nose done too. You're not! I am! She's one of our plastic surgery addicts! Are you getting your nose done? I am. I'm getting the bulge fixed here. The bulge and my nose goes down. I'm gonna get that fixed. Lift it up a little bit. What do you think about that, Bree? I'm not gonna tell her no. It's her body. She's a perfectionist. She's looking to at least feel comfortable in her body. I don't think she needs it but she doesn't like the way her nose photos. It gives you character. That's all I'll say. It gives you character. I just don't like how it photos. I feel it's very noticeable. And I can see it. As long as I could see it, I think that that's what bothers, you know? Thank God for plastic surgeons. That's why they're here. That's why they were invented. They study and they work so hard to be so great at what they do. A little later, I checked in with Dr Chugay. His patient was a German-born food and beverage manager whose given name was Adolf Leiss and was now going by Adrian Davidson. Are you Adrian? Yes. I'm Louis. Hi. How do you do? Fine. Nice to meet you. So have you had all your plastic surgery done with Dr Chugay? Yeah. He did this one and he did the liposuction. "He did this one" meaning... The chest augmentation. On just one side? No, both sides! I mean both! Both sides. Can we see that? Yeah. But now it doesn't match the arms any more. There's nothing left. Right. Am I right in thinking you've had a tummy tuck there? Right here. How recently was that done? Er, about three months ago. Three months ago. It's still in the healing process? Yeah. Could I touch your muscle? I know that's odd, but... You see, it's... It's quite hard. If you flex it... You can flex it, yeah. It's still... So what's happening today, then? They're cutting underneath here and going under your muscle and putting an implant in there. So basically, it will be... ..bigger. Really. So you'll look like you've got big muscles. A bit bigger, yeah. But at least you create more symmetry. Matching both together then. Today, I'm going to make them look like Schwarzenegger. OK. Now, flex your arm. That's what I want to see. Dr Chugay, is Adrian a good patient for you? Adrian is a wonderful patient. He's very compliant. He's very conscientious. He takes good care of himself after surgery. He's really an ideal patient. And is he creating a look and a self, a physical self, that's his idea or your idea? I know you like to collaborate with your patients. I think it usually is a joint effort. The patient wants a certain look and they say, "What can you do to make me achieve that look? "I'd like to look a bit better built that way. "I don't want to spend five hours a day working out." Who's going to pray today? Letty. Letty, why don't you say a little prayer, Letty? God, we think about this day you give us. We ask you to bless us and bless our patients. Take care of them. Protect their lives. We ask you to just help us through this day. Help us to be better persons. Amen. Amen. The next day, and Laura was about to begin her programme of self-transformation. This time, I was hoping to get in on the act and find out if I might be a candidate for something. We were starting with liposuction specialist, Dr David Amron. Hello! Hi, Laura, how are you doing? Good. Hi, how are you? How are you? Good to see you. I'm Louis. How do you do? You must be Dr Amron? Yes, Louis. Anyway, how are you? Good. Feel good? Ready to go? OK, just remove the blue gown. OK. Ooh, pretty underwear. Let me just look here. What we're doing now, Dr Amron, is what exactly? I'm marking out the areas I'm doing liposuction on. Everybody has their own fancy way of doing their markings. I mark the area I'm doing. I mark the high point and my access points. That, to me, is the guide that I use. Good. Turn around and face the wall. OK. Her legs are great. Her inner thighs are great. She's a little full in her upper outer thighs. This area called the saddle-bag region. This is what's defining her widest point. If I just bring this in a little bit it'll give her a better line so she's not so poochy over here. Also, this hip and flank area needs to be brought down. You never want to do the butt itself. I almost never do the butt. But you do around the butt to give it a better shape. You make the butt look more round by bringing this area down. Was that weird for you, going through that? I was just... Not really. I knew he was gonna mark me. I was gonna get drawn on. We didn't mean to objectify you. No, I like to hear what he's saying. I'm excited. Do you operate on, do liposuction on guys as well? Yeah, absolutely. I would say that about 25, maybe 30% of the people I do are men. And so you, in theory, I won't say it's appropriate now, would be able to size me up and say whether I'd be an appropriate candidate for that? In about ten seconds. Yeah. Very quickly I can look and tell. Turn and face the wall. OK. See, this is very good. This is a very good thing to talk about. You're a pretty good candidate. I'll explain why you're a good candidate. You've got some fullness in your stomach and some fullness in your flank. Now, some of this is fat between the skin and muscle. And some of this is being a little bit out of shape, maybe a couple of pounds you can lose by losing some weight. If you lose some weight, it'll all come down. Yes. But you've got a layer of fat between your skin and muscle about that thick. Also, in your flank area, as you turn around... ..there is also some fullness here. You've got a great V over here and you've got this bulging that occurs in the "love handles", it's called here. What is it in England? Love-handles! But what liposuction will do is reduce that layer and make it much thinner... We are just loving this. Now do you understand how we feel? Shoe's on the other foot. Have you ever had it done? I haven't, no. Would I? I would. But I actually am about eight or ten pounds overweight And could be in better shape. But when I'm close to my ideal bodyweight, I'm very proportionate. So I just need to lose weight. It's a mistake to do it on me. Dr Amron began by numbing the incision points through which Laura's fat would be extracted. What I'm doing now is putting that tumescent fluid in Laura. He used tumescent fluid to anaesthetise the target areas and dislodge the fat, making it easier to suck out. Later, Laura went in for her breast augmentation. You have a bit of droopiness so we'll do a bit of lift to take it up like that. The scar will be just around the aureole. We'll see what makes them look the most even for her size. Is that a common size to want to be, full C, small D? Finally, she had her brow lift, stretching her forehead upwards to open up her eyes and eyebrows. Will those bumps go down? Yes, as soon as we go inside and remove some of the fluid, they'll all go away. I'm putting my finger in here just to feel what I call my release. Right there. By now I'd spent a couple of weeks immersed in the world of plastic surgery. The idea of it no longer seemed far-fetched. Encouraged by my consultation with Dr Amron, and reassured by everyone that it was a normal and risk-free thing to do, I'd booked myself in for lipo. But first I had an invitation from Dr Linder, to watch him operating on his receptionist Adriana who, having had her lipo, now needed one of her breasts lifted. Nice to see you. Look at you! Hi! You look different! I do! I am different. I hope so! Why do I look different? What's the... Let me see. You've had your nose done! Yes, I did. I did. How about that! Let's see from the side. My nose was broken from the top. So he smoothed the bottom here. And he slightly lifted the top which was really bugging me. It kinda went down like a parrot a lot. So he smoothed it down. It looks really good. Yeah. I know you want me to go with you. I'm sorry. I love you! Let's do this, finally, huh? Excited? I'm thrilled! It's a little surreal, is it? Like here I am and this is happening. Yeah. You'll be sleeping through it. Exactly. And I'm in the best hands. Dr Linder's the best and I'd never go to anybody else but him. Rebecca, would you like to bring her back so I may mark and photograph the lady? Let's get you marked. Here we go. And, all right. Her right breast is really perky so we won't touch this today. We'll just do this one. Perky is what you want to be, isn't it? Yes, yes, I do. I got the best doctor. That's boss. Let me just take a quick look at that. Wow! Look at that! It's amazing. It's amazing what you can do with the removal of a bit of skin. Adriana's breasts must be like old friends by now! OK. And she wants me to open up her tummy button a bit here. I figured I'd do this cos I'm under general. So I'll do a V-Y plasty. You can put the music up. See how that tightened her up? Look. See the difference? Small difference, but now they'll be perfect. I'll rub that. Is there a point at which a person or a patient should really stop, when enough is enough and they need to stop having procedures? You know, a so-called plastic surgery addict or junkie? Yeah, we don't see too many of those. Thankfully, I don't have those in my practice. Could we have a Vicro straight out? I'm only getting at that point because Adriana has had five or six procedures. So that seems relatively high, but... But you made a determination that this was... Well, her breasts aren't symmetric. They're different. I'm not making her breasts bigger today. I'm making them even. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah, I mean... One breast is sagging. The other one is tight. Doesn't look the same. She doesn't want different breasts. When you first met Adriana, she would have had a different appearance. And the new her that you've helped create, is it...is it your... She's happy, man. She's a happy person, I tell you. Personally, every day at the office, this girl is happy as can be. Yes. She's really sweet, she feels great. She's so happy about her image and how she feels about herself. Have you contributed to her happiness? Unquestionably. Course we have! She has a better self-image about her body. Look at this stomach. It's a flat, beautiful stomach. Her stomach had like skin hanging like you've no idea. Women care about how they look in the United States. I'm not sure if they care in London. They may not care about their appearance but they hell do in this city. So anyway, head right off! Yeah! Go, Brits! Did Nature get something wrong when Nature made women? Know what I mean? In Los Angeles, obviously, women feel that Nature did something wrong. I'm not the judge of what is right or wrong. Only God is. I'm just here to help in a system that we have at this stage in Los Angeles to make women feel good about themselves if this is what they want to do. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that the more women whose breasts you augment then the people with the flat breasts or small breasts will feel maybe a bit inadequate. I totally agree with you. You're right. So you're part of the... I'm part of the cycle. Part of the cycle. I totally agree with that. How do you feel about that? I feel that's the way life is. Life goes on. It is what it is. So you're saying if no women had breast implants, they didn't exist, then women would be happy with how they are and life would go on. Who'd need it? People wouldn't be insecure. Welcome to Los Angeles, Hollywood, Beverly Hills. It'll never change. You're happy to be part of that? I'm happy to help women feel better and improve their self-esteem. Every single day. We just agreed that part of that was making others not feel good about themselves. Who haven't had the implants. Go home. Good one. Get some sleep. Don't you do it like this over here? No, I don't. I'm a normal American. I shake hands. Thank you, honey. Bye, honey. See you soon. Bye, Adriana. # The look # Of love # Is in your eyes # A look # Your smile... # It was my operation day. I was making my bid to join the legions of beautiful people for whom happiness comes from knowing they look their best. I had my doubts about whether it would work for me but I was willing to give it a chance. Hi. Hi. I'm Joanne. I'm one of your nurses. How do you do? Nice to meet you. Do you have anybody with you? Yes, I've got these guys with me. OK. But no family or anything? No. I'll take you, get you checked in and we'll go from there. Thank you. Hi, Louis. Hi, how you doing? How are you? Good to see you. Good to see you. How are you feeling right now? Pretty good. I haven't eaten or drunk anything all day. And perhaps a tiny bit... Tiny-teeny, tiny-teeny, tiny bit of trepidation about going under the knife. You'll do great. Don't worry about things. Um, we talked about taking some Valium beforehand. Yes. If you want, you can have some. You'll probably find you'll do fine without it. Yes. It's probably better that... Let's try without it. You'll be fine without it. Put your arms straight out in front of you. Relax your stomach completely. Good. Do the same thing to the other side. All the way round. Very good. Good. You're not allowed to touch anything blue. OK. Just follow me. Step on the blue sheet. Turn. Don't touch the bed. OK? OK, go ahead and drop your gown. OK. Ready? I'm ready. Cos we know that you really like those undies. How am I doing so far? So far, you've been an ace. You're doing great. OK, Louis, we'll start putting the solution in. Just relax. You'll do great. You'll feel a little pinching as the solution goes in, OK? This part is not the most exciting. OK. Excitement is not actually the word. This is what's called an infiltration cannula. It's a very thin little metal straw. It's got a blunt end to it so it's not sharp at all. There's some little tiny holes there that allow the fluid to come out of it. If I turn it on, you can see it starts to spray out a little bit. It's slowly seeping into the fat. Once we start the liposuction, it's completely easy. This is the uncomfortable part. Is it? You're doing great. It's kind of weird. I feel occasional pinching. Right. And then I feel almost... It's hard to describe. It's like I can feel the sensation of the cannula going in. Right. Almost like I can hear it. I can sense the vibrations of it. But I can't really feel it. So I know something's happening. This area's more sensitive over here. The upper stomach area is probably the most sensitive in the body. Do you definitely have to do that bit? I definitely would like to blend this whole area in. We're almost done with this. The upper abdominal area has more fibrous tissue, more connected tissue. It's harder for the fluid to work its way in and separate the tissue apart, so you feel more as it goes in. Ee-ow! Sorry. A little poke there. Great. We're done with the numbing. OK. Great. So what's happening now? I'm gonna start the liposuction. OK. Got the light. Is that a little better? That's nice. Good. So it's now happening? It's now happening. See this? This is it. Wow, that's the good stuff! See the colour of that? The good stuff! He thinks so! See how pure this is? There's no bleeding in it. That's because of this way of doing it. Look at that. That's the first pressing! Extra virgin! That's right! So how does it feel? It feels, um... It's not painful in the least. Uh, it's weird knowing what you're doing and knowing you're doing it to me. That's a strange thought. It's like you're scrubbing me with a brush from the inside. That's what it feels like. Wow. A strange feeling, huh? It's quite weird. Yeah. How's it going so far? Fantastically. Are you seeing more or less what you expected? Honestly, a bit more fat than I expected. Really? Yeah. You've got a decent layer of fat here. You're obviously a talented doctor. You could have chosen any branch of - any specialism to go into. And, um, some people would say that, of the things you could be doing, this is a relatively, um... a relatively superficial thing to focus on. Uh, yeah. And sometimes, um... Sometimes I feel that. Sometimes I feel like you're not saving lives in this field. Ironically the other field of medicine I considered was emergency medicine. What are the satisfactions in this one if it's not saving lives? I think it's doing a great job at what I do. I'm providing a service. Do you consider yourself more of a scientist or more of an artist? Uh... Both. I guess more of an artist. So what I'm doing now, Louis, is I'm using my noisy spatula cannula. I use this at the surface of the skin to make sure everything is smooth to get a rasp evenly and use the instrument like this. You can probably feel that rasping feeling, right? I do, yeah. Louis, guess what? What? We're done. That was pretty smooth. Thank you! You did a great job. This is Pat and Joanne. I'll see you in the recovery room. Good. Sometimes it squirts out like a little something. Does it? That's it. Swing your legs over the side, there. It's weird, just being aware of him chiselling away. Exactly. Knowing what is going on is probably the oddest thing. The idea of it. People's minds start to work. I know. Even though you don't feel something, it's kind of weird. He's taking a part... He took a part of me out of me. He did. Yikes! So is it fat at the top and at the bottom it's the red-tinged tumescent fluid? Yes, but this also has fat in it. You know I told you I thought we'd get about 300cc out of you? That's about five or 600. Wow! This is great for how slim he is. It looks like a weird salad dressing or something. Yeah. Wow! That came out of me! Out of you, yeah. He says it's an odd idea that you took something out of him. It's a funny colour, isn't it, for a human being? It's more like chicken fat, isn't it? Goodbye! Thank you so much. I'll give you a call this evening. Great job. Take care. You did a great job, too. Very calm and relaxed. You really were. Back at my hotel and I was wearing a surgical corset padded with six panty-liners to keep the tumescent fluid from leaking. I felt relieved it was all over and curious whether the results would make it worth it. After a few days convalescing, I went to visit Dr Chugay's patient, Adrian, to see his results. Nice to see you! How are you feeling? I'm feeling good. You can tell it's... Look, there's not much... ..limited movement. Are you wearing a tee-shirt? Yeah. You see if I take it off, you'll see a little scar. In the light, do you see? Whoa. That's it. It's not much. If it's all right with you, it was about symmetricality. Can we see the whole package? Here we go. What do you think? I'm happy. There are not many guys aged 50 who look that good. What do you think... The only thing is the little gap there. Yeah. He noticed it because what sometimes happens is implants can be pushy and go to a certain direction. It can be corrected, like you see when I push. Hold it in like that. You see? So what he wants to do is he wants to close the pocket. When you do that, they're widening out, aren't they? You see, it's too wide. That's good. Do it like that. Yeah! You could go around... Go around walking like this the whole time. Yeah. Did you know I've had some liposuction. May I show you? Yeah. You did it. Are you happy? Yeah. May I show you? Yeah. That's cool. Are you still wearing your belt? Yeah. How long ago did you do yours? A week. Did Dr Chugay do it? You mustn't tell Dr Chugay about this. ADRIAN LAUGHS Are you happy? It still hurts? A bit. A bit swollen. Yeah. I know it still looks a bit plump, but that's swelling, I think. Yeah, but you wait six weeks and the next thing you have to do is some tightening. You have to do some... Sit-ups? Crunches. Crunches. Sit-ups and tighten it all up. And then you'll see it goes all the way. So how long did you wait between the lipo and the tummy tuck? Six months. Did the lipo, waited six months, did the tummy tuck. Yeah. I wanted to heal everything. To see how much skin really should be removed after all the swelling goes back. You've had quite a bit of work done. Yeah. Do you feel that now you're finished, basically? I'm finished, yeah, except for the touch-up here, I'm done. I don't want any more. That's it. Because if you count everything together, from the top of the eyes, the bottom of the eyes, the cheek implant, the whole facial filler, the chest implant, the tummy tucks, the liposuction, the biceps, besides 50,000 bucks, it also costs a lot of pain. Some people would watch this and think that's a lot of money to spend on something. It's just vanity, really. Do you look that much better and is it worth it? For me, yes. If people don't see behind why... I cannot give them the knowledge or feeling why he did it. They see only the plain facts what is presented on the TV. But if they would take the time and maybe read between the lines. If you get for ten, 15 years, told by everybody, "You're an ugly bastard", what happens? You start believing it. Who's been telling you for 15 years you're an ugly bastard? My stepfather. When you were growing up? Yeah. It sounds like what you are trying to fix is something internal, something inside. And external. Maybe going the physical route is avoiding the real issue. No, I went to therapy. I'm done with my mourning period, whatever you want to call it, with the self-pity, with being different than other kids. That was then. Because I learned that I can turn this negative around to studying, to learning. I can be better. Having changed your exterior, do you feel different? Yeah. It has changed a lot for me. Really. That's because of how you feel about the way you look. Yes. First I drove the Volkswagen, now I drive the Mercedes! I'd had a call from Eve to say that Laura's transformation was complete. I was invited to inspect the results and there was a suggestion that Laura's on/off boyfriend Brian might make an appearance. It's Louis and the BBC. Louis, hi! Hello. Nice to see you. Nice to see you, too. Lipstick kiss. Lipstick kiss. How's it going? Great. An exciting moment, the grand unveiling. Yes. Do you know what to expect? No. Well, no, not really. I mean, I know what she's had. Where is Laura? In the other room. Shall I get her? Yeah. OK. Everything OK? Here she is. Hello! Wow! Come on in! She's ready for a night on the town. Look at you! Turn round. Show them your beautiful body. See how svelte she is? Didn't she heal beautifully? Like a different person. Yes. How do you feel, Laura? I feel amazing. It's like... A lot to get used to. Stopping traffic. A lot to get used to, yes. She stops traffic now. When we go out, guys turn and look at her. Have you had that happen before? No. Let's look in the mirror. We'll drink it all in. And then we see... How do you feel, you know, looking at the new you? Does it match the sense of how you feel on the inside? You know what I mean? In other words, have you kind of got used to it? I'm getting used to it. It's a lot to take in. Yes. I definitely...I don't think it's all hit yet. But it's good now. So how do you feel when you see it, then? Um... I mean, look at yourself. What do you see? The main... The main thing that... I see is now... when I look in the mirror I see a beautiful sexy woman. Whereas before, I always saw like a cute little girl. So that's the main thing. So I'm totally thrilled with it. Now, you could say... that you now look like a lot of other attractive women you might see anywhere in Beverly Hills. You could say it's a more conformist look, like someone coming out of a sushi restaurant or someone in a magazine. Do you feel like maybe you've lost your identity a little bit? No. Not at all. You've kind of gone with the... I feel like I'm stepping into my true identity. There's going to be beautiful people anywhere. But now I'm one of them. Yay! Am I right in thinking Brian... Cos Brian's coming down here from what I understand. He lives upstairs, doesn't he, in another apartment. Am I right in thinking he might be joining us? I think he's coming down to see her. He hasn't seen her like this yet. We have a surprise for you. Hi, how are you? How you doing? How are you? Good. We've got Laura waiting. Hey! Wow! You look great! See my back? Oh, yeah! It's beautiful! Thank you. Do you... I understand... I know this is a little personal. I know Laura and you were in a relationship. On again/off again, a little bit, for a number of years, right? You were even engaged at one point. That's correct. What about now? Um... We're both a lot more complete with ourselves now. So I really see our relationship developing into something a lot more than it's ever been. And this is a very different-looking Laura to the one you've known for many years. Do you think it's an improved Laura? Oh, yeah! Yeah, absolutely. Why? Um, I just think she looks beautiful and great. I like to see her making her... Bringing herself to her full potential. Was that nice to hear that? Uh-huh. Why are you crying? Well, it just makes me happy cos I can see that he's really happy. I can just see it in his face. Yeah. Congratulations. Thank you. You look great. 'It seemed as though Laura's new look had won her man back. 'But I wondered whether it would really give her the inner changes she said she was looking for. 'My last stop was a check-up on my own progress 'with lipo specialist, Dr Amron.' Louis! How are you doing? How are you doing? Good. I'm good. And yourself? Yes, very good. Yes, good. So I'm wearing my corset, as you can see. But I'm no longer wearing any panty-liners. Cos you're not draining any more. No. Right. You know what I mean. Come stand over here. OK. Put your arms up a little bit. I'm gonna tell you something. You used to have a good layer of fat on top of here. There's no fat here any more. I'll prove this to you. Reach down with one arm, one hand. Just do a small pinch here. We'll get a small pinch. You can't grab a big thing here. Can you get a sense there's no fat remaining any more? Yeah. Turn round. Let's see your flanks. Arms up. Looks good. A little swollen here. It's settled down. You look great. So how was the whole thing overall? I felt weird. I had a weird moment when I looked at it two days later and I was shocked how good it looked, in a way. And I felt almost a feeling of kind of guilt at my own vanity that I was taking positive results from something to which I'd really given nothing. I hadn't expended any sweat in exercise, I hadn't worked out. It was like I'd paid a bunch of money to look like I'd worked out. I can, to some extent, understand that. But if you go back to... You know, in these areas, these were always your stubborn areas. You can never really lose these things. I'm not... I know what you said and you said that before, I think maybe if I had worked out really intensively, which I've almost never done in my life, if I spent an hour, hour and a half, every day in the gym, working on my problem areas, or had a personal trainer or something, I'm confident I could have made a significant improvement, maybe even to the point of getting rid of most of that. I have to say I disagree with you. Really? Yeah. That you would... My thing is about proportion and balance. If I feel somebody can achieve - this is important - can achieve the results I achieve with diet and exercise, I don't do them. I really only do people who are disproportionate like yourself and even though you're a lean guy, quite in good shape, those areas were disproportionate in my eyes and to my touch. And, yeah, it's true. In 45 minutes it's gone, it's an easy thing, but my role in this is about 75 per cent. Your role is the other 25 per cent to stay lean and in good shape. I suppose you work in an industry that is all about appearances. Do you ever worry that what you do kind of promotes vanity a bit? To some extent, yeah. I'd say that I think that people should not pay too much attention to it. That it's part of...being human and sometimes I wonder if I do things that make you think too much about it. And so... You know, so I'd have to say, "Yeah" with that. That was a very truthful answer that you gave. Is that all you have to say about that? Yeah, with all this stuff, I don't think people should pay too much attention to it. I think probably we're a bit too vain these days, paying too much attention to it, and there's a good balance with everything. I agreed with Dr Amron. In helping men and women to look their best, plastic surgery has also taught us to feel inadequate when we don't measure up, creating a world of beautiful "haves" and less beautiful "have-nots". As for my own decision, I had mixed feelings. Pleased with the results, but with a nagging feeling I'd caved into convention and lost a little part of me.
