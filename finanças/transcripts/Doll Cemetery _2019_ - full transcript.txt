I can't believe you did this to me. After all that I did for you. But it's true. Why are you listening to me? I can not. But I will. I just need more time. Hello? Is anybody there? Maria? Is that you? Very funny. This isn't a joke anymore. I am here. Hey, man... Come over here. come here. Good dog. Good dog. Hello. Very nice. Good dog. Come on. Come on. Come on. Did you make an appointment? Let him in. Arthur. I hope you are as enthusiastic about completing your book... ... like you who came here on time. Tea? Okay? Okay, two teas, please. Coffee. Thick, without sugar. So, it will be finished. Are you sure? How much is it worth? Don't change the subject. Arthur, you should be my business manager. I see you didn't have a script. You understand what a deadline is, right? Of course. You're the best selling horror writer, And honestly, you are nothing without this new book. You sold the film rights. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, But no one is short of money, right? No, I didn't say that. Look, it's true the last book danced so much attention. That's why publishers are so eager to get another book. I mean, come on, you can be the next Stephen King. I doubt that very much. I'd rather be H.P. Lovecraft or Clive Barker. I think you can benefit us if you clear your image. I mean, stop drinking for a start. Yes. Money from film rights is good. But the fact is you still have to write. I wrote! - So what's the problem, family? He brought the children. I understand. For how long? I do not know. This time it felt permanent. Look, I'm sorry to hear that... But I still have to type, right? Brendan, what don't you understand? You're a writer. And you are nothing without this new book. What is wrong? Are you stuck for ideas? Is that what happened? Look, it's not as bad as you think. Have you written anything? I mean, man, you signed a contract for three books. You only sold one book. You have an obligation, and so do I. It doesn't just happen. Is it true? It should. I don't care what, but it must. Arthur, you better calm down. This deal involves a very important person, And they don't like the answer to no. I'm not just a money-making machine. All right, look, this can be fixed. How? A retreat. Remote location. No Internet, no redirects. It can be overcome. I'll give you Paul's number. Who is Paul? He has the address. Look, you got three weeks to give me something. No more delays. If not, you'd be out there with other ex-celebrities. Now take this number. And off you go. Nice to see you too. Sir. Sir. Is he the one? One by one, Cam. One by one. Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? I have a license, you know? If this is some kind of joke, This is not very funny. I can see you.

Are you here alone? I want to ask you the same thing. Yes, but you... Girls? You're so kind. You think I'm weak and helpless? Absolutely not. So, you got lost? Yes. I'm looking for this place. I think the taxi dropped me off in the wrong place. Do you know that? Do you often stare at women openly? Not me... Sorry. No problem. I'm just teasing. thanks. So you live around here? Why do you ask? Just curious. Just curious? Yes... You have a friendly face, and... Maybe I should stop talking, don't you think? It is okay. thanks. The good news is you are close.

Does this have anything to do with Arthur? Arthur? - Yes, he... Listen, what's the problem? Are you following the first rule? Not. Should I? You must follow him! All right, look, you better calm down and get back in there. You may still have time. You may still have time! Okay. Let's do this. Is that you? Is that you? - What am I? - Leaving my gate open. No, sorry. The whole animal came out. - Your animals? - Yes, my livestock. This gate, you opened it? No, sorry. You're a typical urban type, huh? Are you serious? Soft handed, soft brain. People who don't know how to work hard at all. A person who is always being arrogant. Thinking arrogance can talk to others at will. Are you usually this friendly with your neighbors? Look, I just wanted to know if it was you who opened the gates. You said no. You can go. thanks. Wait. Are you following the rules? Yes, those rules... What do you care?

Maybe some other time. I gave you directions. At least you can accompany the lonely girl drinking. White or red wine? Red. So what's your story? - I'm a writer. - Really? - What kind of stuff? - It's mostly horror. That's not my thing. There is enough horror in this world. Is the pay good? Not bad. Are you enjoying that? That's a different story. Sorry for the pun. Frustrating? Maybe. Horror stories aren't really what I want to do. Not? No, I see myself as Dylan Thomas, or... ... Ted Hughes. The problem is nobody wants to read that, they... Immediate satisfaction. It is true. Everything now, now and now. Impatient. It's a shame. So you moved on to horror? Correct. It's easy to scare people. Is it true? thanks. Yes, you know. If you put it here and there at a fast tempo, You got it. You make it sound easy. It's not that hard, let's just say it. How about your family? That's a different horror story. That sounds like an interesting story to tell. Maybe another time. There may not be another chance. Why? Are you planning on going somewhere? You never know. Yes, I suppose so. Why don't you make yourself comfortable? Later. Who is that? That? It's a nightmare. That is all? Is that all you have to say? He's amazing. More drinks? Why can't you tell me the real reason you're here? Can't women come here for company? Yes. Married, have children? There is no? Not. It's a little tricky. Is that why your wife left you?
