WALTER: Good night, good night. - Night, Dad. - Good night, sweetheart. Get set for Hawaii. You had goodness in mind. I just want you to know I am so proud of you. Thanks, Dad. I'm actually really glad that you decided to come. It's actually a lot cooler having you here than I thought it would be. Well, I should give you trips to Hawaii more often. [laughs] No, seriously, it's, um... I know I've given you a lot of flack over the years for your life choices, but I just see that you've turned a corner. I've really noticed. - See you in the morning. - Good night. ♪♪ - Hey. - Hey. Sorry. Did I wake you? No, no, I was up. It's like the night before Christmas or something. Yeah, big day tomorrow. Small ceremony, but big day. Yeah. So what's up? Well... I kinda had an idea. May I? Yeah, of course. Oh, this is cold. How long have you been in here for? A while. Do you want to heat things up a little bit? Sorry. It's just... just weird timing. You know, with my mom. I knew we should've postponed this. You need to grieve. It's important. Don't tell me how to feel. People been telling me how to feel my whole life. I don't need that from you. I'm just trying to help, okay? Yeah, I know, I know. I'm pruning. ♪♪ [door closes] ♪♪ So... it's sort of a weird hypothetical question for you. If you had a secret, and you knew that it would ruin somebody's life, would you keep it a secret, or would you come clean? Well, why would you want to ruin someone's life? That's really timid. Well, maybe you're not doing it right. I have a black belt in smoking pot. Then you probably tried this before. Wow. That was really junior high school of you. [laughs] Thank you. Uh, um... uh... as amazing and convenient and perky as this is, I don't think I can do this. What's wrong? Do you have dick issues? No. No, I don't have dick issues. My dick works. I just... I shouldn't do this. I-I can't, and I won't. Okay, calm down. It was just for fun. I know, as fun as it would be to have sex with a hot girl named Brian, I gotta take a pass. If I did this, I'd pretty much be the worst person I ever met. Well... I hope tomorrow isn't awkward. I think tomorrow is going to be extremely awkward. Good night. Hey. Hey. I gotta tell you something. It's about your dad. Oh, I'm in here. Oh, oh, that's okay. I was done, Tamara. It's a little weird, Moon. I had a feeling you were gonna say something. Do we have any of that Paulo Santo left to do like a chakra cleansing ritual before the ceremony? Yeah, we should. We had a lot of that stuff. Uh, hey. Morning! Morning. You look like shit. Oh, thank you, Paula. Thanks for that. Has anyone seen Nic? Brides aren't supposed to see each other before the ceremony. It's bad luck. [beeping] [line rings] Would you like a hot dog? They're very good. I know you probably-- They're gluten-free. The buns are gluten-free. You're all so busy suntanning and doing your selfie-taking. [vibrating] Walter, how the hell are you buddy? Jack. Not too good, buddy. Listen, can I run something by you? Yeah, sure. I'll just get into it. I just found out my daughter is gay, which really isn't a problem, except that I found out directly after I had sex with her girlfriend-slash-fiancée. I'm in Big Sur, and they're about to get married in front of a teepee in about two hours. Holy shit. So I'm just thinking about just coming out with it and, you know, just coming out with it before the wedding. Is that a good idea? Should I... Is that the right thing to do? Whoa, whoa, whoa. You had sex with your daughter's girlfriend? Yeah. And you're feeling bad about that. Um, I don't follow. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think about lining up my daughter's friends one by one by one and fucking 'em. Every time with my wife, that's what I'm thinking about. I can't stop it. I don't want to. Right now they're outside... having a pool party. And when I walk over, and I wave, and I say, "How's it going, girls?" they look at me like I don't even have a dick. You didn't fly too close to the sun, Walter. You flew through it. Don't you see? You touched the hand of God, and you're feeling guilty? Yes. I feel guilty. You shut your fucking mouth, and you get down on your knees and you thank whatever god you want to. You can pick one because they've all smiled on you. But whatever you do, don't you spit in their faces. Yeah, it happened, and maybe you'd take it back if you could, but don't make your daughter miserable just because you had the time of your life. - Hey, Karen's dad! - Yes, Tina? How do you turn on the Jacuzzi? It's the last button all the way to the left. - The little blue one. - Jack? TINA: Okay, thank you. Hello? - [girls cheering] - I gotta go. Okay, you be good. And whatever you do, take a lot of pictures. Peace out. You are so pretty, it's like actually disgusting. - Is that true? - I can't look at your face. Stop. If it was me being this in love like you and Nic are, I couldn't do a small wedding. I'd have to do like a big wedding. WALTER: Hey, sweetie. Hey. You okay? Kim told me. I was just coming over here to tell you. I get it. I get why you would wait to tell me. I've been wracking my brain, trying to figure out the best way to tell you. It's just... I was drunk. It was just sex. There was no emotion. I know how babies are made, okay? It's like you're starting another family or something. It's like ours wasn't good enough for you, and... it's like your building another one on top of it. Honey, you've got it wrong. Lucy... is not family to me like you are. You know, I didn't want to have any family here because of all the shit with you guys. I thought it would be bad vibes all around. But now that I'm here, and it's the day that I'm getting married... I really wish Mom was here too. I feel like I fucked this whole thing up. You didn't mess anything up. If anything, I did. No. Actually, everyone really likes you. You passed the Kim test. Hmm. You really love her, huh? Yeah. I do. Well, then there's no hurry. You don't have to get married today. Six-person wedding, it's pretty easy to reschedule. Dad, it's not fair to give me cold feet. Sweetie. I know it's last-minute, but, um... Moon's gonna play Autoharp for the wedding, and I'd really love it if you would sing with her. Oh, uh... You have to. It's my wedding. What do you want me to sing? [line ringing] LUCY: Hey, it's Lucy. I don't call. Just text me. - [beep] - Hey. Listen, could you call me back? It's pretty important. Okay? So, uh... So call me back. All right, bye. Put a little bit of oomph in your hair. [knocking] Hey, blushing bride to be. Girls, can I have just minute with Kim? Sure, Walter. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Okay, I think I figured it out. You are not in a place that this can work out. And you are not in a place to tell me what kind of place that I am in. You know I'm in position to tell you. I am the most qualified guy in the world when it comes to fucking up relationships. That I'd say is true. You need to tell her the truth, and you need to tell her now. Let her choose. If she chooses to stay with you, great. If she doesn't, I'm sorry. But every minute that goes by that you don't tell her, you're hurting her. I know you don't think you have the ability to hurt someone with something you're not doing, but believe me, it's easier than you think. I can't. I can't. It's too late. I... - Then go. - Go? Where am I supposed to go? Anywhere. Just go. Please. Leave her. She deserves to be happy. Please, Kim, just go. Please. Hey, we gotta braid the bride's hair for the wedding, so you gotta go. Bye, Walter. - You nervous? - Yeah. Don't be nervous. You look so pretty. Okay, so I'm just gonna pull some of this back into a braid. ♪♪ [flute] [drums beating] [chanting] ♪♪ ["Canon in D"] Welcome, friends... and family.

We just did a little kissing last night, but that wasn't what I was gonna say. On the drive up here to Big Sur-- Don't. This is before I knew that you were-- This was before I knew.
