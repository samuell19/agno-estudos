What do you know about the plight of the poor? How do they repay these loans? This is illegal. How can this world be so cruel? A 70-year-old man with a 17-year-old innocent girl. It's a dry autumn wind... ... something like a combination with the gentle, calm breeze of spring. It does not fit. Wipe away your tears. I, if you change your tears into a smile.

Can you hear me Shekhar is hopeful about Latha. Even when he was in the village... ... always asking about her. why not? Young people today... ... make a lot of mistakes. I do not praise Shekhar... ... because he's a relative of mine. He thinks of no one but Latha. This is where he went wrong. Someone should see. Both eyes look at the world with open eyes.

Do you want to talk to me? Ah... are you? That day you hit my car. today... After playing the tabla tonight... -... Are we disturbing our sleep now? - Are you asleep now? Going to bed early at a young age is very bad. - You can get sick from nightmares. - Shut up. Who rented a house to you in this colony of good people? A girl told me something good. - She said I was good at accidents. - You should be ashamed of yourself. Even if you are educated, you do not know how to speak. Yes, I do not know how to speak well. You do not know how to listen well. Sir, what do you want? Do you want to fight? Fight? The battle between beauty and love. Something that has been going on for ages. Okay, I admit defeat.

It's a trick to hear about this place. The real reason is something else. Look, she's a prostitute. "my goodness" "God, you need to know what a human being feels..." "... came to earth as a stranger" "Look what we're doing." "You need to know about well-being" "Those who trust you" "Oh Almighty, in heaven, look at this."

Let's go. My good son, why are you crying? Now you can go back home. Home...? Nice boy. Mother's name is Malathi right? Yes. Father's name... Does he not have a father? do not say that. He lives in this city. In this city? What a man. He never came... ... to see his wife and newborn baby. Now I understand. Go sister, try and straighten your ways. Ram Singh. Bring my glasses. Bring quickly. Shaker? My Shekhar. That's it for sure. Shekhar. Shekhar. Brother! Is this Shekhar's house? Yes. Why did you come in? Beg, right? Get out. Did you see that, son? What a bad employee he is. He scolds the wife of this house. Let's say your dad comes home. To fire him. Is it ok When your father comes home, he will kiss you. Will bring you valuable toys. After that, we all go to the village by car. Your grandfather will be very happy to see you. You will forget me when you go to Grandpa's lap. My son, you do not, do you? Latha is mine. I lived on this hope. Will you ruin my dreams and marry Latha to someone else? Young man, do not be discouraged. Without this Latha you will find another Latha. If not this one, another. Son, there are more girls than boys in this city. One of them is written in your destiny. But what do I have that Kumar does not have? Am I not handsome? Please no, son. A walking ad for you to be handsome. Am I educated? You are like a professor. - Am I not respected in society? - No, son. Not only humans but donkeys respect you too. But son, I'm not Lathai getting married. My marriage could have done that. Uncle! You do not recognize my pain. the pain? So should I open a hospital for you? Son, marriage is written according to fate. Marriage to Latha is not written in your destiny. Forget about her. I am doing Latha's wedding. You know I'm single. Therefore, I would like you to take charge of this wedding. Uncle, you talk like you're salting my wounds. You will never meet a son-in-law as good as I am. I do not want a good son - in - law. You are handsome. But I like the handsome nephew. Uncle, you're kidding me. If you have ever loved anyone in your life. You, I have nothing to say about love. Now you, are you trying to teach me about love? you idiot. When I was in college in those days. I gave thousands of lectures on love. Do you know how many classes there are in love? - No. - Then why... ... are you bragging so much about love? Son, there are four classes of love like the train. First Class, Second Class, Inter-Class and Third Class. Your love is a third class one. Your thinking is also third class. All you need is to marry Latha to get my property. Uncle. If you do not think so, I'm leaving. Then why don't you go? He was created to teach me a lesson about love. I have been in love with God for the last fifty years. Shekhar. Son! Look, your father has come. Father... who are you? get out. Are you kidding, don't you remember your Malathi? I do not know a Malathi. Get out of here! Shekhar. It has happened. It definitely happened. Lattoo! What happened? What should not have happened has happened. The train in your heart... ... stopped near the love stop. - What nonsense is this? - Only you, as the parent can know for sure. I know that now too. 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 8, then 8 to 16... Do you keep your mouth shut? You get married, I keep quiet. Do you want that too? It cannot be done. Get out! Thank you, thank you! - Shekhar. - not. The trouble started again. To me, it has nothing to do with you. Go back the way you came. Should I go, did you forget that day? The day you promised to marry me? Sweet words spoken then, happy moments spent. Wasn't love in your heart at that time? It doesn't matter. Why these reminders? Are you such a cunning woman? I lost myself in spending time with you. You made a decent person like me worse. - I am not responsible for your child. - You are not responsible...? Shekhar, you are a man. You can do anything freely. But I am an innocent woman. The crime committed by a man... ... the world hides it. But a woman's slight fault... ... robs her of dignity for the rest of her life. Shut up! What do you know about honor? You came here to ruin my reputation. You are a woman who is tempted. You mean... ... to a woman who has accepted your child as a gift from God. Is this your justice? You swore to be mine forever. You have changed, Shekhar. But, I remember, it was a full moon night. I told you, ashamed. Shekhar, before marriage... You looked at me and said. Malathi, when it comes to our hearts, it means we are married. After that, you are an innocent girl... I was an idiot. I was deceived by your sweet talk. You gave me this baby. Shekhar. For your desires... ... let two lives be ruined? Malathi! Just say what you can. Say you need food and clothing. Take this money here and get out of here. Cash...? Shaker! Are you trying to undermine a woman's dignity? Shekhar, if I need money I will not come to you. If I kill my soul I can make a lot of money from anywhere. I did not come to this house thinking so. - I think this is a temple. - Malathi! I do not have time to listen to your stupid talk. - Tell me if you need more money. - Shaker! If you want to go with dignity, go now. Or I'm going to kick you out of this house. Are you going or not? I will definitely go. Not just from this house. From this world. But first, remove the stigma that has befallen me. Only accept this child as yours once. Tell the world that I am not a prostitute but that I am your wife. Wife? If a prostitute like you says I am my wife... ... the world spits and rejects me. You think about your dignity. Am I an unmarried mother in front of the world? Doesn't my honor matter? Tell me, Shaker. Why are you asking me? Ask the person who gave you this baby. what? Malathi, do not act innocent. As if you seduced me... ... may have attracted more young people. I know you are such a woman. Think about what you're saying, Shaker. Do not insult the entire female generation. That includes your mother and sister. Shut up! Poor woman, was she so brave? I deserve this punishment. Shekhar, are you going? If not me, please accept this baby at least. I do not care. Throw it down the drain. Or jump in the river and die. Shaker! Wait, Shaker! Shaker! God, a woman! She is injured. Take her to the hospital quickly. No need to worry. But, she was very injured. It will take her at least two months to recover. Give the child some glucose. "My darling, come to my heart, do not go back" "Do not go back" "Come like a king and take me with you" "Take me with you" "It will be a full moon night with starlight." "Our love meets for the first time" "Let's sing and rejoice in love" "My darling, come to my heart, do not go back" "Do not go back" "There will be little jokes and little love" "Sometimes I say yes and sometimes I say no." "When I am angry with you, you will try to please me." "My darling, come to my heart, do not go back" "Don't go back" "Grief will be gone when you are by my side" "My heart tells me that all of this will come true one day." "Come to me" "My darling, come to my heart, do not go back" "Do not go back" "Come like a king and take me with you" "Take me with you" Shaker, baby! With the baby... ... jump in the river and die. Doctor, you saved my life. I will never forget your kindness. Should i go Go sister, but... - what? - You said while unconscious. It's a terrible thing. - I am...? - Yes. You said... Asked to jump into the river with the child and die. Never think so. No, how can that be? Can any mother kill her child? Sleep, son, sleep. Sleep. All the doors are closed to you. The happiness of a home, the love of a father, you get nothing. One of your mother's faults has become a disgrace. Her whole life. The world thinks of you as the result of some dangerous act. Where do I take you? Why do you suffer with me? I wish I was dead. People will call you an orphan after I'm gone. They will call you the child of an unmarried mother. I'm helpless. Sir! We have not eaten anything since yesterday. Go. Have pity! Going or not? How many times do I have to tell you? You have to donate something. Here, take it. - May you have a long life. - Go, you go. You have made a lot of money... ... keeping high profits. You must give something to the poor. Otherwise you will be an animal in the next life. What if she was your daughter? - Did you miss a banana? - Yes. Take two from me here. Now give me an orange. Give me an orange too. Son, there is still some kind of grace left in this world. This is too ripe. Yes, this is not a mess. 1, 2, 3, 4, this is rotten. Yes, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. This, rotten like you. Yes, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. How much? Rs. 2.75. Rs. 2.75? But, according to my calculations, Rs. 2.10. 2 cents for the poor fund. Fund... Have you left an orphanage? The beggars in front of your eyes are coming hungry. You raise funds by saying that you are for them. I do not need them. He came to do business with me. Help her. no no. How does a cat get inside? Again...? No need to look. Maybe I was crazy. It's like a donkey's load. An invited guest! Am I an invited guest? Look at the things I brought for you. You are so weird. The new guest had to show his status... ... as soon as he got home. Where does that voice come from? - Latu? - Why, sir? Whose child is this crying? It can be heard in front of our house. Fool, speak slowly. Latha is in that house. Oh my God. Hey Lattu. Where did you bring this baby? What child? Sir, there was no child on the shopping list. But what is this? - what? - see. a child. Lord, the child is very similar to you. Shut up, idiot. Sir! He's good, leave the house alone. Did you see Lattu, someone has put this responsibility on you. Go and hand it over to the police. Police... why sir? What did this poor man do? Okay, I'll go. Wait sir, where are you going? It is 5 o'clock. I have to be at the party by 5.30. You go with this baby. For your lecture, he will applaud. Stop your nonsense and get my clothes ready. - Clothes? - Yes. - Sir, baby. Go! You idiot! God knows why this happened. What did I do wrong? be quiet. An article! Sir, did you bring your family too? The Deepavali festival is approaching. Tell your dad to give me a present. - Postman. - Yes? - Is that Mr. Kumar? - Yes. - That child...? - Mr. Kumar. Kumar's child? Suicide is crazy. Isn't that right? Life and death are in the hands of God alone. You jumped into the sea and tried to commit suicide but... ... he saved you. Forget what happened, daughter. Need to find your lost child. Do not lose hope. Consider this house yours. If you find your son, go where you want. Will I ever see my son again? Why don't you find him? God is with you. My child. Miss Latha's Indian Dance Performance for Orphans. Chief Guest, Chaudhary Govardhanlal Patwardhanlal. And Miss Ashok. The time is 5.30. Ashok has not come yet. Today's generation does not work on time. When I was going to college... ... I'm leaving on time... ... taking care of food, drink and everything. You are a really good person sir. Sir, trust me. If my wife is a minute late for the wedding... ... she will not be my wife. Need to work on time. And we have to be on time. I always have been. Mr. Ashok is present. Is Ashok here? I said he would come on time. Whose student is he really? Chowdhury Govardhanlal Patwardhanlal. Why is he not coming? Ashok, son! Shekhar, where is Ashok? Ashok did not come. Didn't come... okay. Chowdhury is there. Ashok has no need. Let’s start our program. "Oh... an outsider" "Oh... an outsider" "Come, bring the spring of love" "Take comfort in my heart, come, outsider" "It's not my fault." "Then why are you so far away from my eyes?" "Bring the love in your eyes and dream" "Oh... an outsider, come on" "Where did you go leaving me alone?" "Remember all the promises of love you made" "Where did you go leaving me alone?" "Bring a bouquet of roses and spring" "Oh... an outsider, come on" "Come with the spring of love and comfort my heart" "Oh... an outsider, come on" Social work... helping refugee children and orphans... ... Ashok is useless as chairman. Calm down daughter. Our elders have said... ... a little anger is a sign of intelligence. you are correct! But for Kumar, Latha has to endure a lot of disappointment. Yes, you are telling the truth too, Shekhar. But sometimes despair is good for health. In those days when I was going to college. At least once a week I get frustrated. You are right. Where does Kumar spend time helping orphans? He does not even have time for his child. Kumar's child... what is that? You do not know these, this news is old. But it just fell on deaf ears. How can that be? Chowdhury Govardhanlal Patwardhanlal's eyes and ears... ... has been open for nearly twenty-four hours. But your future son-in-law... ... father of a child. - Shut up! Calm down daughter. Stay tuned. You may have an accident. As our elders have said... ... we should even listen to what disgraceful people say. Say, Shaker! Do not ask me? Now I just said that Kumar is a father. He must have had half a dozen young women. Latha can be against me. Yes, this is possible. Daughter, what will you do? Turn the car towards Kumar's house. Silence and sleep. You missed the opportunity to go to my party. Shut up! Your mother will come... ... take you. Your mother will come and take you by the hand... ... heard this. Miss Kumar! Latha has arrived. Take this baby. There! The mother of the child. Come on, Dad. Let's go home. Wait sir, a little. Come on! Latha, come closer to the door and go back? Mr. Chowdhury, wait a minute. - Latha. - What happens to me now? - What are you saying Latha? - I did not know this. You are really a sinner Sinner! Who do you call that? Who else but you? Did you think you could keep this a secret? Come on, Dad. Mr. Chowdhury, listen to this. - Tell me! - Do not make yourself sick because of this bastard. Your blood pressure can go up. Mr. Go in and take care of your child. We will take care of our baby. You take him. The baby is ours! Do what you love. Come on, sir. I thought a lot, but this point is a little weird. Suppose the child does not belong to Kumar. But the woman. Who was in his house, and who was she? Forget it. You are a humble person. You believed what Shekhar told and showed you. Sir, he is a complete cheater. what did you say? Shekhar is a fraud. Get out of this house right now. Come on, sit down. If Shekhar is a liar, is this picture a lie? Open your eyes Chowdhury. How lovingly Kumar is holding the baby. Does someone else's child take more than this? The child is Kumar's. The woman is Kumar's wife and... ... she is the mother of the child. Umadevi, your voice is great. You speak rhythmically. Sleep now! I bow... ... now baby, go to sleep! Oh my God, what the hell are you doing to me? God, what to do now, where to go and die? Phone 2,4,6. Hello mom, talk to dad now. Hello, hello. Where did you get this? I brought this from our neighbor's car. Can this silence the child? Not only the child but also his father is silent. I do not believe in that. This is a strange problem. You are a very good boy. You started crying again. The baby started crying again. Where is your mother, where is your father? Where did you come from? You put our lives in trouble. My back hurts. God what can I do? - I'll tell you what to do. - What do you say? My baby! I am your uncle. He does not want it.

Go to sleep, Princess. Shut up. - Is he a princess or a prince? - Princess brother. Nonsense. Sleep, he talks like this every day. Who knows where you came from? You are made of earth and fall from the sky. Stand up and sleep. A bunch goes to sleep. Am I singing for the baby or for you? - to me. - what? - For the child. - For the child's child. To the older child. You messed up my life. God! Oh, my God! Sleep, sleep, sleep. Go to sleep, go to sleep. Go to sleep, go to sleep. God bless you! God bless Sita! God bless you! God bless Sita! God bless you! God bless Sita! Give alms. God bless you! God bless Sita! - Did you find the baby? - No. Fear not, God is with those who have none. You will definitely have a baby. God knows when I will have a baby. I want to see him. Definitely, meet him. Find the baby every day. Mr. You were someone like Charlie. Has now become a miserable person. I have heard. Women cry for men. But you become a man and cry... -... for a woman. - Lattu! If I can, I will sacrifice for one of your tears. Latha, shed a hundred tears. Latha has no one to see these. Then not even a flute will play. Latu, you're right. - pardon me. - Why sister? Who was that kind person who helped the beggar then? I do not know. There are oranges, grapes. Buy or go. If I get to meet you... ... So, I'm happy. Then... I would like to open my heart to show you. Only if you have a heart. Yes, that person is the one going... Do you not drink? How do you live? Your mother is not here. Drink. Here, Lattu came. He brought you a horse and a balloon. Great, good boy drink son, drink. I brought a horse and a balloon for you. Come on baby. do not Cry. When the father is with the mother, the child drinks... - Are you shut up? - Thank you. Take the baby out. I have things to write. What is this, sir? Do you write all morning, noon and night? Just writing every day. Come on son, let's go out. Sir has to write. My son. Who are you Sir, I... Are you begging Why are you looking at the baby? Don't look like that. If the baby's mother finds out, she will not leave you. Get out! My baby is good to be here. I will not interfere with your happiness. I'm glad to see you like this. Wow, son. The horse is dancing. The horse fell. The child has become a soldier. I have become his horse. On the way, the soldier turned to face him. The little kid grew up and I got older. Sit down, son. On horseback we go to Bombay. I do not hate Kumar. But that child... That child must belong to someone else. He cannot be Kumar. If you want happiness... ... try to find the truth behind this. Instead of moving away from Kumar, go to him. Try to understand him. Kumar! Latha, come on in, go inside. By the grace of God she came to my house. I think about you, I care about my house. You may think that I am not interested in you or your home. You were interested earlier. But now...? First of all, who is the mother of this child? Latha, this child is an orphan. I do not even know who his father really is. So how do I find out about his mother? That's just an excuse. Okay baby tell me who your dad is. Now tell me why you hid that secret from me. Wait, I'll tell you. Okay baby tell me who your mom is. tell me. Now tell me why you hid that secret from me. Bad boy. Am I your mother? Be my son... Latha, a love kiss? - What did you say, a kiss? - Yes, I meant a kiss. Kumar, I thought you were a gentleman. So, did I say something wrong? All I asked for was a kiss. Shut up! If Kumar says that again... I did not mean such a kiss. I meant for the baby... Well, a kiss to the baby. See baby? Even your real mother did not give you so much love. Does this mean you know who the real mother is? Yes, I know. Do what you love. - Then you must be his father. - Absolutely. I am his father. - Then forget me. - All right. Why are you delaying this? - Waiting for the darkness to come. - You treat everything as a joke. I never took you for a joke. I will marry you and keep that marriage vow. How can I marry Latha without her consent? There, Latha came. Ask her today. Why should I ask? - Ask her. - That request is not my job. You, her father. You can order to marry anyone. You will say anything. This Shekhar is asking you something. - What do you think? - Your wish, Dad. Look, Latha agreed. Should we start preparing? Today you both started reading at the same time. Do you know the meaning of marriage? Marriage is... Marriage, it will happen just like that. Lattu, you have helped me a lot to clear up Latha's misunderstandings. But I do not know how to explain this to her. Her suspicions about the child. I'm stuck between these two. Don't worry, sir. You are an intelligent person. You know more than I do. There is happiness after every sorrow. There is an afternoon after each night. After every problem... Sir! The child drank the bottle of poison, sir.

Take this. - I'm not a beggar. - Don't bother us. - Our baby is very sick. - That's why I'm here. Where is my son? tell me. My son, what happened? Son, look at me. Lady, are you back? You made our son sick. You looked at him then and now... Who are you I, his mother. - Mother...? - Mother...? Get out, beggar! - Shut up. - no no. My child. My child, call me mom for once. Doc came. Doctor, the child drank the bottle of iodine. - Iodine...? - Come on. Is the child sick? Yes, Kumar is very sad because of the baby. Kumar...? Do not worry. By evening the child will be well. Doctor, save my child's life. Don't worry, baby is fine. You caused me a lot of trouble. You are a good man, sir. I did my duty. But tell me, are you the real mother of the child? Yes, sir! I am his real mother. No mother in the world abandons her child in this way. I did this out of fear of society. If I had not left, the child would have been disgraced too. You saved the child and lost our peace of mind. You do not know that I had to wear a sari. I took care of the baby like a niece. - Not only that... - Latu! Stop reading. Sir, did Latha call you Anumpada because of this child? Go out. It was my fault. You two are separated because of me. No, it's not your fault. I suspected him and blamed him. Did you come to my house, Latha? You're wrong Latha, this is Kumar's house. Your lover is not here. Go there. He is waiting for you. Kumar, don't do that to me. Are you trying to be innocent now? Sir, it is not good to hurt a woman. Now the truth has been revealed. Thank you, sister. But is the baby really yours? Yes. Where do you live, where is your husband? - Husband? - Yes. Is he not alive? Don't say that, sister. He is alive. So where is he? Don't ask me that. I do not want to share my grief with anyone. Share the pain of your heart with us. Yes, tell us. Do not hide the pain in your heart. Tell us the same. Then your mind will get some relief. He came into my life two years ago. If he did not exist... ... I had to spend my life with my parents. But because of this I would have committed suicide. But he promised to marry me. There was magic in his words. Before marriage I accepted him as my husband. - Matt. - Yes sir. Where is Latha? She has only one place to go. Why do not you say clearly? Where is she Sir, I must have gone to Kumar's house. To Kumar's house... why did she go there? Probably because you're here. Shut up. - Uncle, where are you going? - To hell. - I'll come too. - Go! At first he refused to recognize me. He then tried to pay me to raise the child. But I actually went there to get my lost husband... ... not for the money. Disappointed, I returned. Finally I saw Sir's servant. I saw a look of sympathy in his eyes. Thinking my child will be well taken care of... ... I dropped the baby in his basket. Then I tried to commit suicide. How cruel must he be? Son! It's a very sad story. If it happened to me, I would have shot that poor man. Latha, what is your connection to this house? Yes, she is definitely your girlfriend. Latha, why did you come without his permission? Shut up! How can I talk to my girlfriend like that? - Sister Malathi? - Shashi? Sister. Are you alive? Bad guys, you said you were dead. It would be better if I died. Come with me. I'll show you something beautiful. Come now. Uncle! Look at this. - Malathi? - Shekhar. Shekhar, do you know her? Yes, he knows her. - He, who is yours? - He is the father of the child. what did you say? Mr. Shekhar, is he the father of your child? Who says that? - She says so. - I do not know about a child. Latha, do not believe what he says. He writes stories and plays. These are all his conspiracies. He makes someone a father, a son, a mother. Do you refuse to recognize her? Definitely. I will never forget a face. I saw this woman for the first time. Uncle, did you see her for the first time? We played with the sheep in the village and took photos in the forest. Promise to bring Malathi to town, did you forget all that? Shut up, witch. Come with me. - No - Where are you going? - Leave me alone. - Sir. - Sir. - Uncle. - Shekhar. - Uncle. - Sir. God, what happened? Sister! I came here thinking this was my temple. I will go, I will go not only from this house but also from the world. Erase this scar on my forehead. For once, tell the world that you are the father of the child. I am your wife, Shekhar. You are my wife, but I never said I was your husband. This is my fault. You are my wife. I was lost in the darkness of sin. You brought light into my life. Malathi, forgive me. You are a goddess. Can you forgive me Shekhar, have pity on this child. At least keep this boy with you. Malathi is innocent. I am responsible for her grief. I stole her happiness. I am a sinner. Malathi... Malathi! Shekhar, why this? Get up! Malathi, you removed the veil of sin from my eyes. Wipe away your tears. I will make you happy. Before the world I accept the child as my son and you as my wife. My son! Why are you standing? Sit down. Come on in, Mrs. Jeeva. Matt, give them betel. Your name is Uma Devi, right? Please Uma Devi? Mrs. Chowdhury, where are you? You are so beautiful! Look, in her old age she was still dressed like a girl. Look, how beautiful! Uma, are they not like husband and wife? God bless you daughter! Shekhar, you have a goddess. Make her happy. - Of course, Uncle. - Do you speak English? - Maybe, sir. - It's so bad In those days when I was in college. - English people... - You came to learn Hindi, right? OK! Look at Ashok. He writes in Hindi... ... eats, drinks, speaks, all in Hindi. From his head to toes, a real Indian. God bless you my son! You too daughter... ...God bless!
