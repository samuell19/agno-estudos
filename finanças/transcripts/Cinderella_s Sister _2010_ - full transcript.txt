Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad You do at least have some feelings for Hyo Sun's father right, Mom? Why are you asking me such a stupid question? At least tell me that you do like him, mom. Not because you can gain something from him, but you are staying with him because you like him. If you tell me that, I'll forgive you. Why are you being so foolish? I like him, okay? I like him. I like him because I can there are things I can get from him, okay? Don't you smile at any random person that you have nothing to gain from, you wretched girl. Those guys who smile at you have no benefits anyway. Do you know what life is? All this time you've been leading your life with your eyes on the top of your head. Life is such a dirty affair. You don't know as much as I do, so don't argue with me. Episode 7 Hey. Hey. Hearing her say it out loud, my heart does feel a little pained. It's not that I'm not aware of it. What? Do you think all along, I have no idea? Do you think I do not know how your mother feels? I have to go to the factory. Take a taxi home with your mother. Don't let your mother know that I overheard your conversation. If she knows, she'll feel bothered again, thinking of how to deal with it. I don't wish for her to feel bothered. In the beginning, I was really happy because I have a sister. I really liked Eun Jo. Although she always ignored me, for me, whenever Eun Jo said a word, I'll just giggle happily. I'll giggle even when she scolds me. But the way she treats me... How could she... How could she treat me this way, Oppa. How could she? How could she make me feel so pathetic? Don't cry. Spare me with your act. Snatched? Who snatched it away from you? If you don't want people to snatch it, you have to take good care of your own belongings. Why? Why are you getting angry at me? What? Can't I get angry? Can no one get angry at you? Does everyone have to look out carefully for whatever you do? Oppa. Look out for you, flatter you, praise you. Is that all you need? Do you think you are still a kid? Don't think of relying on anyone. Be independent and rely on your own strength. I'm asking you. With your own ability, what have you achieved? Eun Jo snatched it away? You have never gotten anything with your own ability. What is it that she has snatched away from you? What? Why are you looking at me? Why are you looking at me like that? Do you feel wronged? Are you angry because there's no one on your side? I'm not yours, you brat! Cry all you want. I'm not going to care even if you cry. Oppa. Don't be like this. It's scary. I told you not to do this. Oppa, what's wrong with you? Don't be like this! Eun Jo is not your enemy. You have to create what you want to be yours. And what you create, you have to protect it on your own. If not, even if your belongings get snatched away, you can't complain. Understand? You can't complain even if it?s snatched away from you! Don't depend on me. Even if you depend on me, I won't accept it. Instead of crying like that, you might as well go clean the wine vats. Hurry and grow up. Hurry. Get in. Don't you want a ride? Oh, you're doing well. Yes, I can do this very well. Since he's working for the Goo family, why not we scout him for the kitchen. It won't be easy. My value is a little steep, I'll want twice my annual salary. You should go now. Don't you have an outing today? I'll rush over when I'm done here, let me do this. Hello? Is the place where you make Dae Seong rice wine? Or should I say Dae Seong fake wine? What? You are all dead! Yah! Where exactly is the location of your place? You guys have the nerve to fool around with food?! Get your chairman to answer! Hello? Who is this? What do you mean fooling around with food? Hello? What hello?! Don't move, you better stay where you are. I'm going over now. Did you come home alone? Who? Having heard that your elder daughter is sick, the kitchen staff asked me to give her this. She didn't come home with me. I asked you to go back. With your current condition, you need to rest. Hurry back. Why are you doing this? Since you already know, why are you still... Know about what? Know that she's only staying by my side because I am profitable? Yes. It's fine. Why? Why is it okay? How can it be okay? Since when did it become okay? Since you already know, how can you let mom and me... Your mother, with that kind of thinking, I pity her. The first time I met you, the willful way that you spoke, following whatever you picked up from your mother. I thought, during that period of your childhood, it would be good if I were there. I had that kind of absurd thought. You too made me heartbroken. It's fine, because I like your mother. The fact that she thinks I'm profitable, to me, it?s better than not having your mother and not having you. This is how I really feel. Your condition doesn't look good. You have to rest, why are you still standing there. Let's go. Let's go home and rest for today. Or you can go for the outing with the rest of the staff. You can even get to see flowers. Shall we go pick up Ki Hoon? I... What should I do? Don't leave me. If you can do that, I'll be grateful. Hello? Where are you? I'm alone at Do Ga. I want to try on my own without relying on anyone, but I don't know what to do. Try it, you try it! See if this is rice wine or shit! Fooling around with food. Don't you know what this will lead to? Call your boss out! Don't you have a boss? What's wrong? What's wrong with the taste? Why are you behaving like that? What can we talk to you about? Call your boss! Does it taste weird? In what way? Let me try it. It has gone bad. How dare you sell wine unfit for consumption? This has gone bad too. Call your boss out here! You need to be an ethical seller! Is your boss here? But... Ahjussi, this isn't our rice wine. The bottle is ours, but the wine inside is not ours. What are you talking about? The wine isn't yours? Our wine has been selling very well recently, so we have no stock left. But in the past, we occasionally have leftover stock. We used that as vinegar for our food. The quality of our wine will not change even after the expiry date, it will still be fit for consumption. This is definitely not our wine. I'm very sure about this. What do you want to lose to me? What do you want to bet on if you lose? Has anything like that happened in the past? No. Drive faster. Hyo Sun is alone. I know. I'm driving really fast already. Cheers! Drink up! Drink up! Have one more cup! It's delicious isn't it? Ever since I was born, half of what I've drank was my mother's milk. the other half was Dae Seong Do Ga's rice wine. That was how I grew up, so there's no way that I can't recognize the taste of my family's rice wine. What's the taste of the vinegar that is made out of our rice wine? It's... I can't use words to describe it. Why are they still not here? I asked grandmother to help me get the vinegar. Before she comes, accept my toast. And then each of you can sing a song, how's that? Okay! Okay! Sing a song! Sing a song! Come on! 1,2,3,4! Dad. This isn't our wine. It isn't our wine, but it's packaged in our bottle. Hello. I'm Dae Seong Do Ga's owner, Goo Dae Seong. If it weren't for your daughter! It's bad. I already said it's bad, don't you trust my words? You don't trust me, that's why you have to try it for yourself right? Someone mixed a rice wine of inferior quality into our wine. Where did this come from? Bang Bae Dong Wholesale Shop. Bang Bae Dong? What I'm saying is... You have to understand what I'm saying. No matter who asks you, just say you don't know anything. How much money have you gotten from me already? You've already gotten the money, so just shut up. How can such a man like you have the courage the size of a bean? What do you mean by having the courage the size of a bean? Have you forgotten where I was born? Don't say useless things. Our wine, as compared to other brands, have a shorter expiry date. Other brands of rice wine, use additional preservatives or high-temperature sterilization to extend the shelf-life of their wine. But we don't use those. We retrieve back all our wine one day before the expiry date stated on the label. And because we don't have any stock recently there's no need for retrieving. Are you advertising for your wine in front of the police right now? Do you want us to buy more? There's no evidence to show that we have added prohibited additives during any of our wine making processes. Haven't you investigated? There's saccharine sodium found in the spoilt wine. This shows that someone had the evil intent to sabotage our wine-! This is definitely not a problem with the manufacturing process, but a problem with the circulation process. Please investigate the circulation process. We will try our best to help out with the investigation. We have helped with the investigation! Isn't it your responsibility to investigate it quickly? We have been repeating ourselves for a few days now. During this period, it?s not just the spoilt wine that has been circulating our district. Other areas are starting to return their wine. We've stopped receiving orders too! Don't get agitated, it will be fine. What should we do at times like this? Oh, right. You've said before, not to rely on anyone right? Is there nothing that I can do right now? Can I not even ask this? Is asking a question depending on you as well? I understand, I won't ask anymore. Thank goodness this happened before we added more equipment. If we have done so already and increased the production, the amount we have to retrieve will increase too. It can be solved, don't worry. Can you say it one more time, Oppa? eJust now, it's just like when you said the moon is square, right? You said it can be solved and asked me not to worry. I really felt like it can be solved and I don't have to worry. Since you let me handle it, you should have waited for my news. It's not like a kid playing games, what exactly are you doing? Do you think you can get Dae Seong Do Ga through this method? I didn't do it. It isn't you? Do you think I'm the kind of person to do that? Then... Did Ki Jeong hyung do it? You really don't know me. You also don't know Ki Jeong. It wasn't me, neither was it Ki Jeong. This should be a big hit on their image. Ki Jeong and I should be thinking the same thing. Although we don't know who it is, that person, won't be thinking of helping us. Don't think of using this opportunity to do anything. Please wait. What are you thinking right now? I have to be the first to get the Dae Seong Do Ga that Ki Jeong hyung wants, and let Ki Jeong hyung's nose bleed. I won't destroy Dae Seong Do Ga's image or let it close down. I have to get it. I don't want to have something that's damaged. I want to let it become stronger then own it. It's better for you like this. Is that so? Father and Ki Hoon? Yes. That fellow, Ki Hoon, didn't he enter Dae Seong Do Ga already? Yes. What exactly is father thinking? After he came back, Ki Hoon didn't have a suitable place for him to go. So he let him go there. Father's slave. Do you not like to hear this? Slave. Seems like I still have to say it. Slave. As father's slave, how long have you been following him? Don't you understand my father's train of thoughts? The fact that I keep in contact with Secretary Park, do you think my father doesn't know that? He just pretends not to know. That's the kind of person he is. Father knows everything that you are thinking. Secretary Park, why can't you read my father's thoughts? Go read it properly. Yes. Go out. Yes. Will it close down? What? Is this place going to close down? Are we going to be penniless? Can we get anything? If the factory closes down, can't we keep the rest? What about the house? Can we keep the house? You better be more vigilant. Before we become penniless, even if it's a house, secretly grab it if you can. Transfer everything that you can to under your name. Enough. Mom, please stop. Please, please stop. You wretched girl, what do you know? You only know to ask me to stop. It won't close down. Even if it does, there will be a lot of property for you to get your hands on. There's still a lot. Even if you die, you'll die of greed and not hunger. Is that so? That's good then. De colores (Of colors) De colores es el arco iris que vemos lucir. (Of colors is the rainbow made of that we see shining) Y por eso los grandes amores (And that's why the greatest loves) De muchos colores me gustan a mi. (Of many colors are pleasing to me) Por eso los grandes amores (And that's why the greatest loves) De muchos colores me gustan a mi.

(Of colors is the rainbow made of that we see shining) Y por eso los grandes amores (And that's why the greatest loves) De muchos colores me gustan a mi. (Of many colors are pleasing to me) Y por eso los grandes amores (And that's why the greatest loves) De muchos colores me gustan a mi. (Of many colors are pleasing to me) Excuse me. Um.. What? Um, so.. It's nothing. Salute. Turn off the light. Let's give this a try. Between us. What are you talking about? I won't let you have everything. There was a time when I wanted to be like you. You did well in your studies, you were smart, and haughty. And also.. your I-don't-need-anyone attitude. That arrogant attitude of yours that showed you didn't care if anyone paid attention to you. There was a time when I thought you were so cool. But with no exceptions, you always wound up hurling cold water on my admiration of you. Let's give this a try. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do yet, but let's give it a try. Open it! I had no idea this was what he was doing. He kept telling me to keep watch, so that's what I did. He must have mixed regular liquor in here. President, over there. [Dae Sung Cham Do Ga] You know my heart, don?t you Oppa? So don?t you do something about it? There! You know- Ah, Oppa! I made use of land that was abandoned. But you see, it's about to be reclaimed. Once it's reclaimed, I'll be paid twofold for it! Hey, hey, girls. Girls! Just believe in this Oppa. This Oppa will buy each one of you a huge rock the size of an egg! I'm.. against it. He's my mom's little brother. We can't put in an order for an arrest for Uncle who's run away, Dad. The factory has ceased production for some days now. If we're to cast off this disgrace and start up the factory again- He's my uncle! He has nowhere else to go. Where in the world is Uncle? We don't have time. I would prefer if you were to make a decision. I'll.. look after Hyo Sun's uncle while looking for a way to revive Dae Sung Cham Do Ga. How much time.. But we're unable to estimate how much time it'll take to rectify our maligned reputation. Slowly, little by little.. we can take it slow. We can't do that. Do you have the means to provide during that time? With all the expenses that the TV commercial cost.. even if we were to cancel it- That's enough. Let's take it slow. We can start again slowly. Let's release an official apology through the newspaper and think of ways to resolve the issue with the factory. Are you crazy? Why should we release an official apology when we've done nothing wrong? It was our fault that we didn't pay attention to what our employee was doing. I don't think he did it on his own. I'm positive that there were other people involved. If no one else will do it, I'll go to the police on my own and put in a warrant for his arrest. Try and obey President's wishes. Don't act like you're so perfect. Dae Sung Wine can get back on its feet in no time. Because the taste of the wine is so different from other brands, and because people can't bear not having our wine, they look at this regretfully. And there are other supportive calls that we didn't expect to come. Are you referring to that one supportive call? Do you really think those calls were sincerely supportive? Won't you be taking steps to restore your reputation? Won't you have to reorganize the factory? Can we reorganize it for you? There are already people waiting in the wings to open up their greedy mouths and swallow Dae Sung Cham Do Ga whole, you imbecile. Because of my stubbornness, we started the advertising and spent a fortune on it. I just want to die. Do you know that?! Wait! Let's talk for a second. Huh? What does that mean? Do you mean you left this place? Move. Tell me what you meant by that! Let go of her before you speak. Where is that? Couldn't you tell me where it is? What does it matter? We're not going to sell. Move! No, no, I don't want to meet you. If it's for that reason, I don't want to meet you. No, no, don't come. Our Dae Sung Cham Do Ga won't die over something like this. We won't hand it over to anyone! Dad. Dad, you didn't shave, right? What are you doing? I want to become someone who can be your support and a help to you. I really want to be like that, but I'm nothing, aren't I? How can you say something like that, you punk? Even though I'm nothing right now, in time I'll become a source of strength for you, Dad. Really? Your face has become so ashen. How did it become like this? That's enough. Here too! Here too! That's enough. You need some here too. Aigoo. Dad.. Let's go in. You won't go in? Let's go in together, we all need to talk. And so if we clear this up with buyers in Japan and it's discovered here that they had a positive reaction, I foresee a good chance that Korea will have a similar reaction as well. It's alright if we can't persuade many buyers. It's the taste of Dae Sung Cham Do Ga's wine that will convince the rest. There are a few clients currently staying at a hotel in Japan who've tasted our makgeolli, and they had nothing but positive things to say about it, which gives us hope for others. Is that so? We need to at least give it a shot. What do you think, Eun Jo? For now, I'll go to Japan. I need to go local to see for myself. I want to go. Really? And I'll take Hyo Sun with me. Hyo Sun's been having a mental battle with herself lately. I'm certain that she'll be of help on this business trip. I... I thought you said you wouldn't let me depend on you. Or on anyone. I'm not letting you depend on me. I'm showing you what to do if you don't want things snatched away from you. I thought you said that Eun Jo didn't steal what was mine. Even if it's not Eun Jo, I'm talking about anyone. If they're challenging you because they want something of yours, you need to protect it. These are your plane tickets and hotel vouchers. The business cards and contact numbers of the people you're going to meet are included as well. Since you need to leave early in the morning, he's said for you two to get some sleep. Excuse me. President wants to see you. Excuse me, Han Jung Woo. What's with the bag? Aren't I being kicked out? We've discovered Hyo Sun's uncle's whereabouts. You and I will need to go places together tomorrow. T-together? Leave your stuff and follow me. You know where Uncle is? What? Nothing. Don't get distracted and concentrate on driving. Yes ma'am. In the past, someone was cutting up some kimchi. When I stood by her side sneaking some pieces to eat, she'd always slap my hand away. I'm just saying. Where are you going? You and I still have some food left. Sit down and finish eating. Noona. I told you before... No matter where you're living, I'll always go and find you, and your life.. You're that Han Jung Woo? Took you long enough to figure it out! You're really quick on the uptake, aren't you, Noona? So you're that Jung Woo. Yep! You still can't believe it? I really am that Jung Woo. Why didn't you say anything? I told you I was waiting for you to recognize me, Noona. Since you couldn't figure it out at all, I couldn't hold it in any longer so I spilled the beans. If I hadn't told you, you wouldn't have ever figured it out, huh? How can I figure it out? That this Jung Woo is that Jung Woo. Because I've gotten so handsome, doesn't your heart race? If you keep fooling around, you're asking to get hit. Hit me then. I want to get beaten to a pulp by your hands. But I got a call that he was definitely here. He was here, did I ever say he wasn't? He was here for a few days, but he ran away without paying for his room! He left without saying where he was going? Look here. Have you ever seen someone who was running away say where they were running to? What relation do you have with him? Pay for his room before you go! He's disappeared? It doesn't seem like he's going to come back here. I heard that he bought some land with the money he made by selling the bootleg liquor. But that seems to be a fabricated lie. It's probable that he ran because he had no way of explaining his actions. I'm waiting for a call right now, so don't go far from there and wait just a little while longer. Okay. Honey, Joon Soo is anxiously waiting to go on that trip with you. Oh, alright. Are you in pain, Honey? No, I'm fine. Because you had a lot of stress from what's been happening lately, you couldn't get any rest at all. This won't do. Joon Soo can wait until next time, you need to get some rest. Having fun with my son is resting. Come on. Are you sure you'll be okay? I said I'm fine. Dad! Oh, my Joon Soo! Aigoo, Joon Soo! Now, let's go! Oppa, do you know how to speak Japanese? I don't know a single word of it. It's fine. They?re in charge of taking care of tourists for top hotels in Japan and they?re great fans of Korean dramas so they?ve studied our language. Ah.. Hello. It's delicious! Yes, it is! Hallyu stars drink this wine as well. I can confidently say that there's no other wine in Korea that can compete with ours. The large companies think we?re no competition for them but our taste is beginning to shake up the industry. I know this person. Ms. Matsumura showed us the commercial that this young lady appeared in. You're quite lovely. Thank you! My son doesn't speak much, but after seeing your ad, he's begun talking to me a lot. And has told me he thinks you're beautiful. Ah, yes. This may be a little much of me to ask, but before you go.. I'd like to invite you to my house. I feel that my son might consider me differently. Ah. We'll accept your invitation with gratitude. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! What is this? Take it. It's yours, Noona. All of the pay that I get after my service in the marines.. I've saved all of it without spending a penny. Even though it's not much, it's all I have. But why are you giving this to me? Because I saved it up to give to you, Noona. So why did you save it up to give to me? Brat.. pretending to be dense. Are you asking because you don't know of the reason? If I saved up my first paycheck, who would I give it to? What is Mr. Jang doing with his life? No, forget it. Don't answer that. I don't want to know. I don't know either. I've lived by myself since I was 16. But if I were to speak exactly, I wasn't by myself. Because I was living with you, Noona. What about baseball? Did you give up baseball? Noona, I was living with you. Stop fooling around. Yes ma'am. I'll take this for now. R-really? I'll try and build up the interest, and I might borrow a little, but I'll give it back to you when you get married. Hello? Oppa. Oppa! Oppa! What? Oppa. Oppa.. Dad.. What about President? Dad has collapsed. While Dad was out having fun with Joon Soo, he collapsed.
