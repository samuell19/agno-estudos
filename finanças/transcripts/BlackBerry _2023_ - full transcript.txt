I'm thinking of the incredible breakthrough which has been made possible by developments in communications, particularly the transistor and above all, the communications satellite. These things will make possible a world in which we can be in instant contact with each other, wherever we may be. It will be possible in that age, perhaps only 50 years from now, for a man to conduct his business from Tahiti or Bali just as well as he could from London. In fact, if it proves worthwhile, almost any executive skill, any administrative skill, even any physical skill, could be made independent of distance. When that time comes, the whole world will have shrunk to a point. And the traditional role of the city as a meeting place for man would have ceased to make any sense. In fact, men will no longer commute. They will communicate. - Fuck's sake. - We're not late! - No, I know, but I'm going to throw up. Okay. Shit! Matt Sundin is the sleepiest of all out there. He's proven NHL talent but not scoring like the Leafs need -- - Your 9:00 is here. - Where's Brock? - His office. - Mr. Balsillie? You wanted to see this report. - Talk to Shelly. Integrated circuits... Well, I finally understand that quote, When you grow up, your heart dies. That's from "Breakfast Club." John Hughes. Do you hear that? Uh, yeah. You talk about that buzzing? - Mm. It's an office, I'm sure they got a million little buzzes. - Mm. - It's a subtle buzzing. - There. - You've identified it. - Mm. - What? Made in China -- the mark of the beast? Uh... Um... Mike? - I can't concentrate. And so what? Are you going to fix this? - I'm going to fix it. - Uh, now's not the time. The meeting starts in, like, two minutes. Now's not the time. Now's not the time. Now's not the time. - Okay? I need, like, a paper clip. That's a guy's thing. That's a guy's fucking thing. It has no off switch. That means it's always on. So it's just always buzzing. - Uh-huh. Yeah. Um... Well, Yeah, go fast. You can tell him he's not going -- -- He's not going to get steel. Alloys, Harry! I'll call you back. They're outside. These guys really are Dutch, huh? Listen, Rick, I've thought about this a lot. And if these guys take the deal, I want to run the new division. Think you can run this place? Yes! Yes! Me too. Just so we're clear, if this thing doesn't go, we never had this conversation. Great. Great. Um... Thank you. There's one adjustment. Apparently the Americans offered them some fancy tax splitting plan, so we need to show them the Canadian version. - I don't have that. - No, no. Callahan worked something up last minute. We're going to bring him in to explain it. Callahan. Uh... You know what? I think that's a bad idea. Why is that? I tell you what, Rick, why don't you have Callahan explain the tax thing to me and I'll just -- I'll work it into my pitch. I think that's better. - Kyle was up all night putting this together as a favor to me. He gets to present. - Rick, I mean... You're going to have this guy present to Stork? I mean, he looks like a.. fucking, a total goof. Jim... I'm not asking. Okay, great. Okay. Bald, scary looking guy walking towards us right now. - God damn it! - Mike? Yeah. Got it. - Watch the fuck out! - Oh, shit. Sit down. Sit down. Much better. Yeah. What can I do for you? Yes. Hi. I'm Mike Lazaridis, CEO of Research in Motion. We create various computer hardware systems using both custom design integrated circuits, as well as off the shelf components provided by major hardware vendors such as Intel, American Micro Devices and CYRIX. Our clients have included US Robotics, Rogers Cantel, RAM Mobile. Just a second. Hey, you're on Callahan's desk, right? Okay, great. This is Jim Balsillie. Brock wanted me to do a quick proof of that tax stuff before the meeting. Could you bring me a -- Exactly. Okay, great. Thanks. Okay, uh, what is this? So w-we had a shop teacher... who told us -- oh, we had a shop teacher in high school named Mr. Moshinsky, who told us the person who puts a computer inside a phone will change the world. Well, we have a plan to piggyback on the unused bandwidth of the UHF spectrum to create an all in one mobile device. Adam Callahan's assistant is here to see you? - Send him in. Great. - Sorry, Mr. Balsillie. No one -- I didn't realize you needed a copy of this tax report also -- - I'm in a meeting right now. Okay. So, basically there is a free wireless Internet signal all across North America, and nobody has figured out how to use it. There's free Internet in this room right now. Mm-hmm. It's like the force. Sorry. Have you seen "Star Wars"? No. So, okay, picture a pager, a cell phone and an email machine, all in one thing. We call it, um, Pocket Link. Okay, listen, we don't do anything like that here. We are a commercial manufacturing company. You want to talk to a VC guy? And you need a better name. You're going to cry?! Mike! Oh, it's just disappointment? - Yeah. You did great! Well, I saw that Rick sent the limo to pick you guys up. We must need this merger worse than I thought. So, I know we have a lot to cover, but I thought we should start with our tax strategy. Now, I'm sure you heard it from the Americans, but let me assure you, we also know how to cheat on our taxes here in Canada. Okay? Here's what we can do: We run payroll out of Ontario, but we pay all our vendors from the Netherlands. We split that fucker right in half. The left won't know what the right is doing. Plus, we get a nice little provincial kickback on manufacturing labor. We get a massive federal tax credit because they don't know whether they're private or public. Beam me aboard! Prisoner, and held captive within the digital world of the computer itself. Hello? Hello! So, what you're saying is that you just touch and talk? You can use your cellular phone to order me a pizza. And that includes 50 minutes of air time. - We'll page you. - Well, it's very hip to be on the Internet right now. I still think Apple has a future. The way out is not to slash and burn, it's to innovate. Oh, okay. Here's what I think. Mike, super simple. Hit him with the good news, bad news routine -- good news, bad news routine. All right? You're going to say good -- Mike?! What? Everything's going to be fine. We still have the US Robotics deal. We're like, what did the cave say about Aladdin, "Diamond in the rough"? Fuck! - What? - I forgot the easel. No, we have to change the name. Product needs a new name. You're giving that guy way too much credit, man. He hasn't seen "Star Wars." He's bald. How much you want to bet they don't even mention the phone. Are you office dad? Dude. Okay. Make a make a -- make a thing. Make a "Scott sucks" -- - I can't. That's why I'm using your computer. 21 boy Canada. That's me. This guy's telling me about sniffing his -- Sniffing his -- Did they buy the phone? So, we've got good news and bad news. The -- okay, the bad news is that, yeah, the presentation, we were not heard, and they did not understand the product, and so they did not buy the phone. - What was the good news? - What's the good news? Emergency movie night, right now, Steven Spielberg's "Raiders of the Lost Ark," letterbox. - No way! - Shotgun. Shotgun. Shotgun. Shotgun! You said their headpiece only had markings on one side. Are you absolutely sure? Balloq's staff is too long. "We're digging in the wrong place"! Don't! - "Bad dates." - Bad dates. - Couple of bad dates. - A couple bad dates! Couple bad dates! - That was -- that was there. Why did they go the other way? That was like that... Mike, you're missing your favorite movie, man! Toronto wins it by a count of 5 to 4. Doug Gilmour adds three assists to his five to finish the game with 30.... ... in the extra period. But obviously the story was -- Are they top or bottom left? Go, I got my whole group. Send -- Send everything. Top left. Let's take. Let's take a gamble. We'll go for Scott. - Does anybody have a type-c coax? - They don't even know I'm not even top left. - Scott, you're attacking me. - What? - You're attacking me. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Send the dogs, Ethan, Send the dogs. They're rushing. - Bottom right. - I'm sending another. Another. They got rockets. I got to run down. Anybody have any type c coax cables? - Kiss it bye-bye! - Oh, the plunger is moving! - No! - The plunger is moving! Dude, come on. No! No! Ow! Ow! - Oh! - I'm sorry, boys! But it's back! It's back! - You had them -- - It's back! - Thank you. - Thank you so much. Nothing for me. Thanks. So I know how to sell your phone. I know how to market it, and I know who we can sell it to. - Who? - What do you mean, we? Here's the deal. I will leave my job at Sutherland Schultz. If you make me CEO of Research in Motion. Are you serious? That was the worst product pitch I've ever seen in my life. You guys don't stand a chance out there. You need me. Sorry. I don't know who you think you are, but we are just fine. We have a $16 million deal with US Robotics. - 16 million? - That's right. Wow. Okay. And what did they buy? Modems. Ever heard of them? Are they like the force in "Star Wars"? Very funny. You know, your logo literally is SS. And how much have they paid you on that $16 million? - Yeah. Nothing. - Zero? Nothing yet. We haven't delivered the modems. Well, we shipped them product samples months ago, and their accounting department won't even return our phone calls. - Yeah, but they're gonna -- What's going on? They're going to pay us. We have a $16 million deal with US Robotics. Yeah, so, uh, you guys are getting fucked. Why would you -- why do you think -- why do you say that? Well, because I would do the same thing. Little operation like yours. They know they can withhold payment till the last possible second and then crush you. These guys, they're... They're pirates. Uh-huh... We got it. Thank you. Um... How do you know anything -- What the fuck do I care? How much money do you got? Yeah, um... Okay, guys? - 2.50? - Here's what I'm going to do. I will give you $20,000 cash today. I'll sell the phone, I'll work out this problem with USR. But I want 50% of the company, and I've got to be CEO. - That's... - Are you joking? No. Obviously. Obviously. No. No! - Should I just -- - Mike? - Okay. Okay. - Who is in charge here? - Oh, I mean, technically -- - Mike is in charge, and he says no. I am in charge. And I say... Sorry. You don't need to do what this guy says. We just met him. He's not your dad! Okay... Thanks. Thank you. Very sassy man. Wouldn't you say? He had a -- He had a sass. "Modems, ever heard of those," or whatever, like -- Oh, no. I sassed him too, but he sassed me back. Like, what's he trying to say? We don't have our modem deal? US Robotics. How may I direct your call? Yeah, it's Mike Lazaridis from Research in Motion. We're actually building some circuit boards for you guys. - One moment please. -Mike! Is that you? - Yes, hi. I was just wondering if -- if it would all -- be at all possible for us to invoice you for the first half or third of our -- your order from us, if -- if -- can -- can we invoice you for some some of our -- your order. - Oh, what? What? - If that's okay? Did you not get my fax? We don't have a fax machine. Mike, those modems you sent us back in March, they were defective. - I'm sorry. What? Yeah, they didn't work. We had to cancel the whole order. But this was months ago, buddy. I really thought you guys had a fax machine. Hey, I tell you what, why don't you let me make it up to you? I'll have USR send you one free of charge on me. Okay? Um... Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Great. Okay, well, good luck, Mike. -Yeah. - Bye-bye. Bye. What? Here's what you got to do: You got to call him back, you got to "Glengarry Glen Ross" this guy. You got to grind him. Yeah... I don't think I can grind him. This is exactly what that Rolex guy said was going to happen, right? He predicted it! What did he say? He said US Robotics are pirates. He was fucking dead on. Yeah. All right. - Hey, Steve? Steve? - Yeah? I need the phone line. Some guy is trying to say Noonian Soong is a Q. Thank -- yep, thanks. - All right. - What are you doing? I think we should take this deal. No! No -- So... You don't get into business with people like this. That guy is sketchy. - I think he's... I don't think he's sketchy. His business card is literally sketched out. The guy's a shark. Okay. Do you know... Do you know who's afraid of sharks? Pirates. Um, so, uh... We've been talking here, and we -- We would like to make a counteroffer. You came crawling back like bugs, like grubs. Yeah. So, we would like to offer you... 10% for... $500,000. Are you out of your fucking mind?! I look at 100,000 deals a day! I pick one! Is that the quote? No. I look at 100 deals a day! I pick one! "Wall Street." Okay, uh, w-- uh... 25% for $250,000. 50% for 50 bucks! 33% for $125,000, and you can run the company with me. Mike? No! No! Yes. Deal. Deal. - Okay. - Easy. Dude. It's going to be totally fine. You're going to negotiate this guy to death. Score! - Yeah? - Hi, Jim. It's Mike Lazaridis from Research in Motion. We met at the office the other day. So, we'd like to offer you... 33% of our company for $125,000, and you and I would be co-CEOs. ... period. Couple of them are suspect. That's their eighth shot of this hockey game in 6:44. -Sure. - That's an improvement. Deal. Awesome! Awesome! Dude! Mike! Scott! Scott? He did it! What do you mean? Have you not heard anything that's been going on in this room? You can have, like, two minutes Maybe you should tell them about the modems. Oh, where do you want to put him? What the fuck is this? That's a -- yeah, everyone builds their own desk. That's -- that's a tradition. - Yeah, I'm not doing that. US Robotics pulled out of the deal. Told you. What's our exposure? - Exposure? - How much money did you spend on the modems? Oh, $1.6 million. - One point what?! - What?! Spent $1.6 million on materials and labor. Where did you get $1.6 million? I got a loan from the Bank of Montreal. Mike, come on. Get me US Robotics! S-- Sorry, who are you talking to? Yeah. What the fuck is that? Oh, it's called a carrier wave. The calling modem is a -- Hey! Get off the fucking Internet! - Yeah. - Mike? - I think it's Casey. - Uh-huh. It's going to be fine, no, it's going to be fine. You don't get to talk to our team like that. You just get to talk - - Mike! Hi. Actually, no. This is Jim Balsillie. I'm the CEO here now. - Co-CEO. Okay, Jim, what can I do for you? I want to talk about these modems. Well, there's nothing to talk about, sadly -- w-we can't accept the defective product. Let's cut the bullshit here. $2.5 million, all in, for the entire order. - Yeah. No, can't do it, Jim. Then I'll decimate it for you. $1.6 million. And if you don't take that, I'll turn around and sell them to Rockwell for even less. That's negotiation. Okay, how about this? We'll take the modems if you throw in the patent on Mike's phone. What phone? I thought we weren't bullshitting each other, Jim. We've been building our own for a year, we want M-- How long to build a prototype of the phone? The Pocket Link? Yeah -- a year. No, no, no. A prototype, Mike. A shell I can wave around in a meeting. It could be a complete piece of shit. No, it -- we're not doing that. No, we're... Mike's not doing that. L-listen to me: US Robotics is building their own phone. We are now in a race to get this thing to market, and we are a year behind. So I don't care what you need to do. Get these fucking nerds to drop everything and build this fucking phone! What?! Sorry, guys, um... My girlfriend tried to cash my check this morning and it bounced, and she said I'm not supposed to come in here -- allowed -- I shouldn't come in here anymore. And she agreed, I won't be coming in here any longer until I'm getting paid. - Whoa! I can fix this. Okay, Research in Motion. It looks like your account has exceeded its overdraft balance. Didn't they just deposit a check for $125,000 from me? Yes. Okay. All right. Um... I have a mortgage with you guys. Can we pull that up, please? Spell your last name, please. B-A-L-S-I-L-L-I-E. - "Ball-SILLY"? - "BAHLS-lee" Anybody gonna miss this red chair? - No. - You're good. Different guys, different piece. All right, everybody, listen up. From now on, checks will be coming every two weeks. You will come get them from Shelly. This is Shelly. - Hi. All right. That's you, Shell. Mike! - Me too? - Yeah, sure. Sorry. Who -- So, who is Shelly? Shelly? Oh, dude, that thing's haunting you. No, I'm motivating you. And don't call me that thing. I'm your boss. - No. No, you're not. - Yeah? Get me John Woodman at Bell Atlantic. - You got it. - Wait, um, what are you doing? We are selling the phone. Mike, I need a prototype. - I told you, I don't -- - Mike? Connecting you. Guys, -we are over $1 million in debt with no assets, no contracts and no products. -John Woodman's office. - Hi, this is Jim Balsillie, CEO of Research in Motion. - Co-CEO. One moment, please. Okay? - Yeah, I -- - No! He said there's no phone! - I'm not asking you! Mike. - Okay. - "Okay" -- wh-what do you mean, okay? No, no, wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. -John Whitman. - Mr. Woodman, I am about to make you insanely rich. - Mike does not agree with this? - He just fucking did! That was duress! Okay?! You're manipulating him! It's obvious! What do you want me to do? - Uh... - What? So there's a reason why your intercom is emitting white noise. It's because it was manufactured in China by engineers who didn't care. And now every office in the world has to suffer an annoying hiss, a blinking red light, 15 different power cords that are utterly incompatible with one another. So we're not doing that. We are not just adding to the hiss. I will build a prototype, but I'll do it perfectly or I don't do it. Mike, are you familiar with the saying "perfect is the enemy of good"? Well, good enough is the enemy of humanity. Shelley, get John Woodman back on, please. So I reach out, hang up the phone. He looks up at me like, "Are you ready to die?" No, no, no, no. And I'm prepared to die on it. Right? Mike steps in between us, brings the glasses down and goes, "Bitch, I tell you, when we set the goddamn meeting." And he backs off. - Oh! - All right! Woodman wants to see it. We're going to Bell Atlantic tomorrow. - Wait, what? - New York City tomorrow. - But he said -- - You have till 8:00 a.m. T-to do what? So, you didn't call him a bitch, did you? Okay. Okay. Okay, new plan, everybody. We are all going to chip in and build this thing tonight. Okay? All right, give me a Fillmore toggle switch. Give me 33PF, uh... - Yeah. I think it's like something kind of like a hybrid of one. So I like the... I thought you were playing "Civ." We're back. I've got something for you. That's why to me, like, remote controls... Buttons be small enough that... Got some spurs, neural connections lost. - You taking it off? - Yeah. I'll see you guys tomorrow. - Yeah. So adding the lithium ion does what... Still hot. Still hot. I had a dream we were rich. And sometimes my dreams occur exactly as I dreamt them. Let's go! What's that from? "Dune." A-ha! You'll get dressed at the airport. Yeah. Thank you. Should Doug, come with us or-- No. Because he has a lot to do with this. He's a goof. Get in the car. Yeah, I think he really wants to come. Let me tell you the best advice I ever got at Harvard. You want to be great, you need to sacrifice. The more painful the sacrifice, the greater you'll be. He -- he's my best friend. Okay, great. I saw him put a toilet plunger on a computer. Attention passengers on AC42 to New York, your flight is now boarding. Aww, come on. So, if you hear me crinkling a piece of paper, that means stop talking. Like, in general or... No, in -- In the pitch. Oh, yeah. Gotcha. Hey, we got to move here, man! My wife's in labor! Let's go! May -- may I ask why your business card had the phone number crossed out? I have no idea what you're talking about. Hey, let's make a deal, okay? You and I never lie to each other. Sure. I didn't quit my job. I was fired. And I just mortgaged my house to pay our staff. So, if this doesn't work out, I'm fucked. Why did they fire you? Because they're idiots. - Hi! Research in Motion? - How are you? Fantastic. Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water? - We're good. We're good. Okay. They'll be with you shortly. - Okay. Thank you. Great. - All right. - Jim? - No, no, no, no. Never take the drinks. Thirst is a display of weakness. No, I may have forgotten the phone. - Please tell me you're joking. - No, I'm completely serious. Fuck! All right, here's what we're going to do. I need you to draw out a little sketch. - Okay. - Okay? Something that shows the keyboard just like you did in my office. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Excuse me, miss. Can I trouble you for a pen and paper, please? They're ready for you. Great. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Oh, wait, wait. Here he is. - Don't worry, okay. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. Good. We, uh -- are we waiting for anyone? I'm alone. Okay. Good. All right, guys. Here's how I see it. All right, now, I know your marketing team tells you that you sell togetherness, family or staying connected or whatever, but let's be honest: you sell minutes, period. I mean, your market is minutes, so your biggest competitor isn't other cell phone companies, it's home phones and office phones. Those are free minutes. Those are wasted minutes. So how do we get those minutes back? We reinvent the cell phone. We put a computer in it. We put the Internet in it. We make your cell phone so fucking useful that you never have to come to the office again. Does email, text messaging, however you want to communicate; total individualism all in one device -- that fits in your fist. So, you can tell your marketing team you're not selling togetherness anymore. You're selling self-reliance. Uh... You are not a tech guy, are you? I'm not a -- The whole world... The whole fucking world is trying to do emails on a cell phone. We had an entire division working on it for, I don't know, eight months or so. You know how many phones they got to work at the same time? 11. I mean, it's a network that's built for pagers. That's all it can do. You're in la la land on -- on this one, you know, you got -- I think, you know, some nerds took you for a ride. Okay. Mike? - What happened? - It won't work. - What do you mean it won't work? - Mike? They tried it already. - How did you try this already? Guys, I think the meeting's over. Did you just put your devices. directly on the network as though they were clients? - That's right. - Yeah, right. So what did that get you? Like, ten phones working at the same time? - Uh, yeah. - Yeah. Okay, here, just hold this a second. Okay, so here's your issue. When -- when you use a phone as a client, what's it doing? It's just sitting on your network constantly asking the same question: Did I get an email? Did I get an email? Did I get an email? So it is forever pulling on your servers whether you got an email or not. We have a fix. Okay? So we are going to build a giant computer that will act as a sort of massive client that is hardwired directly to the Internet with our phone as server. Okay, so when a user gets an email, Waterloo pulls it in, packages it, and then... sends it. We engage with your network maybe a split second, like... like, less time than that. So how -- how much -- I'm sorry, how many -- A month's worth of traffic would be less bandwidth than a local phone call. So you could have half a million devices working simultaneously. - Can we see it? - Yeah. So it's a prototype. So it's a long way off from, um... Oh, it's just a long, long way off -- the prototype. Well, it's definitely the world's largest pager. No, it's actually the world's smallest email terminal. Sorry. I see. This is a... Oh, this -- this -- Yeah. Oh. So, try with your thumbs. Try typing with your thumbs. Oh, yeah. What do you call it? It's called a BlackBerry, it sends and receives email messages. It is also a cell phone. Morning, Mr. Balsillie. - Good morning, Mr. Balsillie. - Good morning, Mr. Balsillie. Mike's here before me? He didn't leave last night. You are mentioned on page nine. Carl Yankowski from Palm Pilot keeps calling. Yeah, well, tell him if he wants to talk to me, he can come to Waterloo. - That's what I said. Ted Rogers wants to have lunch in the city. He booked Canoe. No, no, I'm not -- I'm not going to fucking Toronto unless there's a game. Oh, and call Gary Bettman's office about those Leaf tickets. Fucker tried to stick me in the third row. "Fucker, third row." Got it. All right, try 114 and 114. Okay. Go for 114. Okay. Sending. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Boys! Done! Done! Yes! Yes! Come on. Hey. Hey, Jim. Yeah, we, uh, we built a messenger, fully encrypted two-way messaging that is absolutely inaccessible by anyone, including us. It is -- it is -- untrackable, untraceable, unhackable. It's texting. Uh -- so -- so, no. Do you know how much it costs to send a text message? Yeah, 10 cents, and the network gets every penny. We're never going to see that money. Right, but these texts are sent via data. So, behind the network's back. Which means...? Unlimited free texting, only on BlackBerry. Fuck yes! Hey! Fuck yes! I sent a message that Alexander Graham Bell said to his assistant, "Watson, come here." That's what I -- - Alright, let's just -- Let's just... - Yeah, yeah. What the hell are you guys doing?! Sorry. Who are you? You said if I wanted to talk, I had to come to Waterloo. So, here I am. Gentlemen... Meet Carl Yankowski of Palm Pilot. Oh, really. Doug. How are you doing? So, I just said three words: two liter bottle. And you know what they said? They said -- "Carl, nobody drinks two liters of Mountain Dew." I mean, they didn't see what I saw. Large pizza, big soda, complete dinner. We sold a billion liters in a month! You playing with yourself under there, Mikey? All right, let's clear the air here. I had nothing to do with US Robotics trying to bankrupt you back in '96. Defective modems, working modems. Were they defective? No, it was 100 years ago. Who's to say? Me. Exactly. Here's what we do. Combine BlackBerry and Palm Pilot, one product. It's the two liter bottle of smartphones. Would I still have complete control over every aspect of engineering and design? No. Okay, well, then that's gonna-- we won't be able to move ahead with this, I'm sorry. Sorry. You guys love saying sorry, don't you? Okay, let's see what you closed at. $4.50. Oh, God. Is that Canadian? US Robotics... Huh, $83. Now, that gives us a market cap about $45 billion. So what would happen if I just... I don't know, bought up all your shares. And what's the word for that again, sport Hostile takeover. Hostile take-- What the fuck? What is happening? We would just say -- we could just say no. We ow-- We own the company. You know, Carl, you've got a deal. - Yeah? Yeah. Just give us a couple of months to get our people taken care of and then we'll, uh, we'll agree to a private sale. - Wait, just -- - Mike, it's okay. It's okay. It's better to get rich now than to fight this guy in court for the next five years. That's right. You know, I like you. You like hockey? God, no. It's moronic. You? Hate it. I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubble gum. Oh, they based Duke Nukem on this guy. Like, that is Duke Nukem for real. Okay. Party's over. Has a shotgun. White male, 30. - What? - Listen up. Turn that thing off, please. - Wait -- - Can you -- can you -- Turn it off. Al, can you slide it? - Yeah. - You guys havin' fun 'Cause we're about to lose our fucking company. What the hell happened at this lunch? Turn that fucking thing off! Okay? Yeah, Doug? So, my question is actually for Mike. How are we supposed to sell another 500,000 phones when we are already maxed on every network we are on? - You guys will figure it out. - H-how? If we put more phones on these networks, they're going to crash, period. We are not allowed to sell more phones. Mike? No, you don't worry about what's allowed. I say what's allowed. I don't even understand what the problem is here. Who cares if this guy wants to buy our company? Isn't that good? - I fucking care! That's who cares? I care! I'm trying to keep this company together, you fuck! I'm sorry, do you even know what a network limit load is? Doug... Talk to me outside for a second. What? What's a network limit load? - This is impossible. - What are we supposed to fucking do, Mike? Either we jack our stock to the moon or Yankowski fucks us! Well, Doug is right. Unless the carriers rebuild their entire networks, there's nothing we can do, the phones use too much data. Well, then, fucking shrink it. Yeah, okay. Um... We -- we looked into that. - Uh-huh?! These guys can't do it. What do you mean they can't do it? You said they were the best engineers in the world. I said they're the best engineers in Canada. Well, okay. All right. Who could do it. Maybe top guys from Motorola or Microsoft or Google. Okay. Wait, what? What? What? - What are you doing? - Who else? Where else? John Carmack. Get John Carmack from ID. Did you guys hear me? The guy who made "Doom." What's "Doom"? Have you played "Wolfenstein"? Please just don't sell any more phones. - Can you hear me? - Yes! Yes! Oh, shit. Hey. All right. Listen up, you deadeye dumb fucks. Sorry to cut your little vacation short here, but we got some product to move. - Product? Can we move? - I'm sorry. What's that? Say it again. - Well, I thought the engineers said that we maxed out the networks. Yeah, they did, yeah, and that's their fucking problem. Okay? Your problem is you need to sell a million blackberries before Q3. - Uh. That's -- - "Uh. Uh." "Uh." I'm not fucking joking. I want them gone. Actually talking about banning these. - Banning? - Nobody pays attention to meetings anymore, they're crouched over. - Tell 'em to stop. - Okay. We call them Crackberrys. Come work for me. I can't. - Why? Because I'm under contract here. How much to break it. Excuse me. How much money do you want to break your contract with Google? I -- I'll give you $1 million if you sign right now. I am not moving to Canada. We are not having this conversation. - $2 million. - Stop. - $3 million. - I need you to leave. $10 million. Well, you don't have $10 million. This is $1 million option deal. I will backdate that to when RIM was trading at $1. Merrill just gave us a target of $13. Is this legal? -Carl! - Palm-Berry! Yeah. -Hey, listen, I can barely hear you, buddy. I said Palm-Berry, isn't that great? Listen, I'm getting some static on the line. Can I, uh -- can I -- can I call you back? I can barely hear you. What -- Carl? Okay. I'll call you later. Mike? Mike Lazaridis Uh, okay. If Jim fired you, I can't undo it. I'm sorry. I've tried. - No, no. I just got hired. It's Paul. - How you doing? Welcome. Where are you coming from? - Google. Nice. What'd you do? I was the, uh, head of a physical engineering. You are not a salesmen anymore. You're male models. I want you at every country club, yacht club, tennis club, wherever the elite go, you go. I want them to see you using it. Be big. Be loud. Have them thinking, "Who is this annoying prick, and how can I be more like him?" What is that? And when they ask you, don't say, "It's a phone that does email." It's not a cell phone. It's a status symbol. Anybody else? Anybody else? Alright. Hi, I'm calling on behalf of BlackBerry. I heard that you're interested in buying some of the Quarks for your corporation. It's 7:55. We're back with Fox 5 Consumer News. A global BlackBerry crisis this morning. The company says it's experiencing massive service interruptions. The company's helpline says that users can expect delays in sending and receiving messages. Yes, yes, we are aware of the problem and we are -- we are sorting it out right now. Down over there, Dougie. We've been down for this long before. Are we totally fucked? - Hey! Quiet! L-let's just keep it down out here, guys, for a second. How many are down? Maybe 10,000. Oh, Jesus. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hello? -You have a collect call from-- - What the fuck is happening?! Will you accept the charges? Are you still there? - Yes, I accept. -Thank you. - Mike?! - Hi. - There are three reasons why people buy our phones, do you know what they are? - For email. - They fucking work. Yeah. Okay. It's not us, Jim. It's the carrier. Verizon is doing something weird. Well, I'm about to do something weird if you don't fix this now! The deal was I get the engineers, you shrink the data. - Are you -- are you -- Are you selling more phones? - What the hell do you think I've been doing over here, Mike! We're in the middle of a hostile fucking takeover. Do I need to have somebody babysit you dorks?! Okay. Okay. So that's -- Okay, uh, yeah. The entire system is crashing. He's selling more phones. - Hey, Goddamn it! - Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. You know, maybe just hold off selling more ph-- I'm not fu-- God! Okay. Sorry. Is this technically legal? Eugene! I'm actually in a personal meeting, Charles. And I personally don't give a flying fuck. Engineering can't do a goddamn thing until you send that fax. Now, take a meeting when the union isn't ripping my guts out. Do you hear me? Get it done. Son of a bitch. You said you were located in Waterloo. What is that guy's name? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey, everybody. Welcome to Research in Motion. I know this is a bit disorganized. I promise we will get everybody settled. So in the meantime, we're having a bit of a network issue, So put up your hand if you understand MOBITEX architecture. Two people. Okay. That's fine. You two, you're with Mike. The rest of you, I don't know what you do, but follow me, we're taking a tour. Let's go. It's going to be a little bit like Sam Rockwell in "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles." Can I talk to you for a second? What is Charles Purdy doing here? - I'll get the DVD. - What are you talking about? The man standing in the hallway directly over my left shoulder. - Oh, Jesus. - Listen to me. That guy will fuck you up. Do not let that man anywhere near your engineering department. Trust me. Yeah, okay. Yeah. All right. I'm serious. He will fuck your shit up. Can I help you? You're Mike, aren't you? Yes, I'm Mike. What are you doing here? Charles Purdy. I'm your new COO. Oh. Jim hired you to be the -- Chief... - I'm here to get this ship under control. We are under control. Oh, really? Who's? Hmm? Okay, so then let's try something different. Instead of shrinking the data, maybe we spread it out. Thank you. Well, why not take multiple towers in the same zone and split the packet between them? We can put it back together at the server. We tried that. Here's the problem. The towers don't recognize one another. Each one has no idea which piece of the signal they're receiving. And the whole process just keeps. Maybe we reprogram the towers. They're not our towers. We don't control them. That's okay. At Naughty Dog, we had to hack the PlayStation to get "Crash Bandicoot" running. Okay, so if each exchange is triangulated, we could divide the signal three ways. We could actually do way, way more. Every BlackBerry is a server. We could divide the signal between every user in the same grid -- - Divide it by thousands. It'll be like Napster -- distributed network of your own users. - It's got to be in the terms of service, Hackers would be on it so fast. But they encrypt everything server side, right? Mike? I mean, everything is already encrypted. Mike? Mike. You can have my bacon. What are they paying you? I shouldn't say. - They're paying me $10 Million. - Yeah, me too. Hold your banner. Hold it. And now. Higher on that side. - Let's get a chair over there. Here you go, buddy. Yes. Come in. Mr. Purdy. Yeah, uh, so... First of all, sorry about before. Alan Lewis. Which one of you is Alan Lewis? Ah, Michael's had a breakthrough. Now I want these tested, and I want the report on my desk Friday. When? Sorry. Friday. This looks like a whole new relay system. Testing this would probably take me a month. Well, then you best get started, hadn't you? It's bad luck to work on movie night. Work on movie night... You're all children. Is that it? Sorry. Who are you? You think this is funny?! Is it?! Didn't want -- just wondering, who -- who are you? I'm Charles Purdy. From this moment on, you all work for me. And if that work is not done at a pace that I expect, you'll be fired. And I'll keep firing until this room is full of men and not little boys playing with their little penises. Now, are there any questions? Um. Where's Doug? Doug! How's it goin', bro? Movie night tonight. Movie night. Have you seen this? - No. - Have you been out there? No. Dude, Jim killed movie night! Actually, what am I saying? He didn't have the guts to do it himself. Apparently he got this 300 pound dude to go in there, start screaming at everybody, said he was going to fire Alan. Mike. We do -- we do need to get back to work. Yeah. Do you not ever wonder why these guys are willing to work 80 hours a week, never see their families, never get any credit? It's because they get to work on the best phone in the world, Doug. That must be it. Hello? You're making a big mistake, sport. -Yeah, sorry -- - Don't you dare fucking hang up on me. - I'll call you back. Don't hang up on me. Don't you fucking -- How's everybody doing? Jim. I know this isn't exactly what you want to hear, but this board feels that in order to avoid further disruptions, it's best we end our relationship with BlackBerry. John, we're just getting started. Jim, I'm serious. We're willing to take the hit on users and let them go crash somebody else's fucking network. It's over. No. What's over is your bullshit limit of 500,000 users. We quadrupled it. - Okay, Jim -- Our engineers reprogrammed your towers. As of right now, Verizon is capable of carrying two million blackberries at the same time, and we've already sold half of those. Bullshit. Try me. How did you do it, Mike? We are number one in handset sales, subscriptions, customer retention, attracting new smartphone users, and brand recognition. We control 30% of the North American market. And with the upcoming release of the BlackBerry Bold -- ...we're on track to control 50% of the global market. Now, our numbers are a bit below our estimates right now, but we are expecting a nice bump when the 8310 comes out in March. Now is probably a good time to talk about moving some of the assembly and construction to China. No, no. Take people off of Onyx, if you need more bodies, hire more people. We're not moving to fucking China. - All right. - All right. Oh, my God. What?! Uh, that's a good spot to leave it for today, guys, thank you. Hey, where's Jim? - Why? - He's not answering my emails. Well, we're pitching the trackpad to Verizon on Friday, so he's probably working on that. I'm in a meeting! And I really believe that Vasily -- 'is that how you say it? Or something like that? You know, he was in there. He says, I've heard guys screw up my name, but worse than you. Anyhow, he's a patriot. He really does -- He's a hockey guy that really wants -- there's no big money. That doesn't mean -- He's a hockey guy. He plays... No, don't! Hello? Hand the phone to Jim. -Who's this? - It's Jack Manishen in marketing -- it's important. Jack Manishen, marketing. Yeah, Mike can handle it. Maybe you could speak to Mr. Lazaridis. He does not want me going to Mike with this. At least tell me where you're going. He wants to know where we're going. Hang up. So, three things: A widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough Internet communications device. An iPod, a phone, and an Internet communicator. An iPod... A phone... Are you getting it? These are not three separate devices. This is one device. And we are calling it... iPhone. Here's four smart phones, right? Motorola Q, the BlackBerry, Palm Treo, Nokia E62 -- the usual suspects. They all have these keyboards that are there, whether you need them or not to be there. And they all have these control buttons that are fixed in plastic. - Why would anybody want a phone without a keyboard? Well, what we're going to do is get rid of all these buttons and just make a giant screen. A giant screen. And when we start shipping in June, we'll be selling iPhone through our own stores and through Cingular stores. And it's my pleasure to introduce the CEO of Cingular, Stan Sigman. - Are you fucking kidding me? - What? That's Stan Sigman. That's the CEO of AT&T. You know, Steve and I first met about two years ago in New York City when he shared with me this vision that he had for this product. - This fuckin' guy. - And we've been working on it for a long time and actually --- All right, everybody, That's it. Fun time's over. Back to work. I need a prototype of the Bold in my hand by Friday with a working trackpad. Thank you. That's crazy. Yellow. -Hi. Is this Douglas? - Yeah, yeah. I'm from the Securities and Exchange Commission, and I was wondering if you could answer some questions for me. - Sure. Okay. Check the knock. Were you involved in the hiring of a Mr. Paul Stanos? Sorry. You're from where? I'm from the SEC. It's a serious call? Yes. Yeah. You called the wrong person. I can't help you with anything like that. Is this Douglas Fregin? -Yes, ma'am. - Sorry, I have you listed here as one of the founders of the company. I... Yeah, I guess I am not. Uh... Doug? I got to go. I'm sorry. Unknown number? - No. - Mr. Balsillie? - Yes. Welcome to the NHL. Thanks for having me. Nice to meet you. Just this way. Okay, great. Right in here. Yeah. Good to see you. Thank you for taking the time. Oh, I've always got time for you, Gary. Get me on the phone with Copps Coliseum. It's at the arena in Hamilton. Yeah. Tell 'em I want to buy it. Okay. So I thought you were buying the Pittsburgh Penguins. Yes, I am. Let's go. - Okay, we got to go. - One sec. This is it. This is good enough. This is good. - This is good enough? Apple is launching a marketplace for applications. It's going to be third party developers. Any -- any -- any -- anyone -- This is bad. Bad time, bad time, bad time. - Bad time. - Third party developers. - Hey, man. - Yeah. - It's laggy as hell. - Good enough. Good enough. - Okay, now. - Yeah, we got it. - Doug, come on. They're launching an application marketplace. Okay. So the touchpad is working. I don't know if I would say that it's working-working. What? Do you have a suit? 2.4 inches, 480 by 360 HVGA screen, and to top it all off, the world's first trackpad, which we believe will be the dominant navigational device for all mobile devices within the next two years. The BlackBerry Bold. That's it? Uh-huh. That -- that's what you got for us? A trackpad? Uh... Y-you guys see Apple's thing? Any reaction to that? - Plenty. Yeah. It's an overdesigned, trying-to-do-too-much toy that will crash any network gullible enough to take it on. It is, by every metric, the exact opposite of everything we do at Research in Motion. Less data, no frills, reliable network. Okay, that's BlackBerry. Sexy slogan, Mike. So, I guess you just want to kill your whole network? Because that's what it would do. Yeah. The iPhone, they put a keyboard right on the screen. And it's the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my entire life. Ask anyone what they love most about their BlackBerry and you will get the same answer every single time: The keyboard, the click. Okay Th-this -- - Well... Yeah, yeah. - This entire market was born of our innovation, our idea to put a keyboard on a phone. We did that. We built that from a pile of garbage in 1996. So, there's another slogan I don't know, Mike. AT&T's got Apple, we were kind of hoping you'd come in here with an iPhone killer. I -- I don't need to kill it because it's going to commit suicide and it's going to take down the whole fucking Cingular network with it. I'm giving you gold, and I think you're all misunderstanding it. Uh... I created this entire product class. I created this entire fucking market. I created this entire product class. So listen to me -- the trackpad is a mouse pad. Uh -- Built into the phone. Yeah. And... Right. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Good enough. Thanks, guys, for coming down. Tell you what. Let us -- we'll we'll talk about this internally. We'll get back to you, okay? Tell Jim we missed him. Let's go. He's back. Back in Waterloo, working because... So, he promised me not to mention... the other thing. We're not quite there yet. But we're working on something pretty top secret. He made me promise not to mention it, um.. Prototype, we're still a few weeks out, uh, but, you know, I can demo it with our Bold prototype. So it's still a BlackBerry. It's our BlackBerry. So you -- Except for where -- where we have keys here, um, screen, the whole thing is a screen, except ours, when you press it, you'll get that that satisfying click, that BlackBerry click, our trademark click. So, screen, keyboard, phone. Screen, keyboard, phone. Screen, keyboard, phone. Are you getting it? Mike. Mike? What the fuck was that, dude! Where is this fucking limo? Capacity max is at 17,000, but we can enhance it to 19,000 without too much trouble. All right. I want all this basketball shit gone. From now on, this place is a permanent rink. We can't do that. - Why? We have active contracts with a dozen clients. - Cancel 'em. - Yeah, but there's going to -- I'll pay the fines. I want that to be my personal box. That's not a box. That's not a box. No, no, no. Okay, so it's a screen, but it needs a raised hinge or actuator, as I wrote, between it and the body so the entire device clicks when you press on it. Wait. What? I'm just wondering why we want to do that. That -- that -- that -- is not the question you ask me here. I don't -- "Why" does not matter to you? Okay? Because I said so. Because that's what I sold. Okay? Who are you, by the way? Easy, Mike. Oh, come on, guys, please. Silent mode! When we're at the office. Charles! - Phones off. - Sorry. Sorry, Mike. Sorry, everybody. Okay, so you know what I think all this is, is we're trying to do the old BlackBerry click while embracing the new iPhone screen. That's all. - No, no, no. We're not embracing anything to do with Apple! Guys! It's really not hard. Okay? We pay you a lot of money. This is really not hard. It's a keyboard on a screen, on a keyboard. And I don't care what you think of it. Mike. Fuck is Doug talking about. Embracing what Apple is doing? I don't understand. You come back from New York talking about a brand new phone, right? Prototype in a week. What are we doing here? - Can I talk to you? - It's a prototype, Charles, I can build the fucking thing myself in a night if I had to. - We still got to ship the goddamn thing. - I said use the Onyx -- I did! On curve! All right, China. It's the only way this gets done. I'm sorry, China. Yeah. Fuck it. Do it. China. China. Let's do it. - Wait. No, no. He doesn't mean that. - Hey, hey, hey. Don't -- Don't speak for me. - But, Mike, what are you doing? What am I doing? I'm trying to keep our biggest fucking customer, what the fuck are you doing? - Mike, I'm trying to help you. - You're not though. You're not. You're not helping me. This doesn't help me. If you can help me, we wouldn't be here. I don't need your fucking help anymore, okay? You're fucking useless! Okay. Figure out China Figure out China. And I'll build the fucking thing myself. Fuck. What? - Is this Mike Lazaridis? -Who's -- Who's this? - My name is Dara Frankel. I'm from the SEC. Do you have a second? Not really. Not right now. What is this about? I'm trying to track down some information on some stock options your company issued. Well, that's not -- I wouldn't know anything about that. I think you'd want to talk to Jim. Okay. Would there be a good time to come in and talk about this? No, I don't -- no. Okay. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Jack Manishen says he needs to see you. Okay. Yeah. Where is he? - Camped outside your office. - Great. Shell, do me a favor. Reach out to Carl Yankowski's office and let him know that Jim Balsillie's got opening night tickets to the Hamilton Penguins for him. I know how much he loves hockey. All right, all right. Relax. You got me. That same woman from the SEC keeps calling. Can I give her your number? - No. Okay, so first quarter, second quarter, third quarter. Fourth quarter. And this is us. Whose numbers are these? Apple's internal projections. They released the numbers on Friday. $500 fully subsidized? This is the most expensive phone in the world. It has the highest consumer interest of any product in history. We're going to go from number one phone in the world to that phone that people had before they bought an iPhone. It's gonna be fine. Mike'll figure it out. What? Hey, um... Why is the SEC looking at us? They called you? Yeah. Something -- Something about stock options? I'm sure it's nothing. Yeah. It -- It's nothing? Yeah. What's with this Apple thing? What--What about it? - Are we worried? - No. Okay. Why? Because one of them uses as much data as 5,000 BlackBerrys. Because it has no keyboard. Because the thing is a joke. So why are people telling me that they're about to kill us? Because they're idiots. Get me a meeting with Stan Sigman at AT&T. What are you doing? Okay, so the soonest I can get is next month. His office said he's leaving for vacation today. Tell him I'm coming to Atlanta right now. Let's go. Let's go! Tell them we'll be there in an hour. Hey, it's -- Gary, how are you? Good. We're ready to go over here. How soon can you get to New York? Great, uh... Anytime tomorrow. How about today? That might be a little tight for me. I've got the board here now, and I don't know when they're all going to be together again. If you want to wait, up to you. It's your deal. Yeah. No, that works, Gary. I'll -- Yeah, I'll be there. Looking forward to it. Okay. Alright. Bye. Change of plans. We're going to JFK. We're dialed in. Listen to me, you mouthy fuck! If I say we're going to JFK, we're going to JFK! Do you understand? So we're--we're not meeting with Sigman, then? I'm doing it all. Hey! Fuck. - Where's Jim? - I have no idea. C'mon, we got to get you out of here. - What? Why? - SEC is raiding us. Wait, what? Give me your phone. Where's your goddamn phone? Mike Lazaridis? Can you handle this? Who are you? - We spoke on the phone. You want to come and answer some questions? Sure. Sure. After me, is it? Okay. Okay. Okay, what? What are they doing? That's -- That's -- No, no. They can't touch any of that stuff. They -- - Passwords on everything. - Oh. What's the password, Mike? Am I required to give that to you? No. Are you hiding something? Um... Should I not have a lawyer or something with me for this? Do you think you need a lawyer? Jim. Gary, what's going on? You got me -- got me waiting out here. Jim, look, we're not going to waste your time here, okay? It's not going to happen with you and the Penguins. What? We held a vote with the other owners and unfortunately, it went against you, 26 to 0. Hold on a second. Hold on, hold on. I thought we had a deal. When did the other owners even get...? I'm sorry. What changed here, man? The owners did not find you to be of good character and integrity. I don't know what the hell that means. Gary, what the fuck is this? You know, it's funny. It's one thing to have a secret plan to fuck over the NHL and move a team to Canada. It's another thing to brag to your rich friends before you actually do it. Oh, you guys are so fucking stupid. You know what? Maybe I'll buy this whole fucking league. Huh? How about that? Don, can we see that Mr. Balsillie get safely back to Canada? Oh, fuck all you people! Fuck you! Get ready for a hostile takeover of this entire fucking league, okay, you fuck? You think I won't fucking do it? I'm from Waterloo, where the vampires hang out! Go, go, go, go, go! - We'll never make it. - I said let's go! - Delay Sigman. - I called. They said he's already left for vacation? Where? They just said he's going to the airport. Great, so are we. And is this your signature? Yep. And this? I don't know what you're looking for. These are standard employment contracts. I'm just wondering how you convinced all these engineers from around the world to come all the way to Canada. It doesn't make sense. It's because they get to work on the best phone in the world. - Mike. - Hmm? Each of these contracts offers backdated stock options. You were illegally pricing your own shares so you could hire engineers with money you didn't have. Do you know what the sentence is for multi-million dollar stock fraud? Okay, I swear I had no idea about any of what you just said. Do you expect me to believe that? You're CEO. Co-CEO. Tell me why this can't wait another few weeks. I'm telling you, Stan. I'm headed for the terminal right now. -What? - Well, hold on. I'm at gate 7. Where are you? -Are you running? - No, Stan. No, I'm good. I'm telling you, I'm -- just give me the gate. I'm getting on a plane here, Jim. Okay, listen, Stan. Alright, here's the headline. Half a million BlackBerrys for AT&T for $0. -What's the catch? - Nope. No catch. They're yours if you're willing to release them at a discount one month before the iPhone. Stan, come on. You owe me. You've sold a lot of minutes because of us. Yeah, but you know what the problem with selling minutes is? What? There's only one minute in a minute. -Hey. - Okay, Mike, listen to me. I think we've got a big problem here. I know what Apple's doing. We shouldn't talk on the phone. - Why? - Um, we're in trouble. -Why? - We're in trouble with the SEC. But get back as soon as you can. I have a way to get us out of this. Hey. Okay, so, listen. AT&T knows exactly what they're doing. They wanted Apple to build them a data-guzzling monster, because that's where they're going to move the market. They're not selling minutes anymore, Mike. They're selling data. He's here. Who's that? They're waiting for you next door. Who's -- What -- What did you do? I made a deal. The SEC gets you, your board seat, and our full cooperation in their criminal investigation. And for that, they'll leave us alone. And they want $183 million. You said next door?
