[waves crashing] [crickets chirping] - That's three in a row. - Bet you can't make four. - Put the ball down. Go on, put it down. Just hold it straight, no leaning. - It's straight, it's straight. - That's four. - It wasn't dead center. - The angle, it's tough and it's slightly dark. - No excuses. - Gotta keep the ball straight, Jenny. - You gotta kick the ball straight, Eddie. [Jenny laughs] - That was dirty. You pulled a Lucy on me. Now you're gonna get it. - No, Eddie, no! [Jenny screams] [Jenny laughs] Oh Eddie, Eddie I'm scared. - Of what? - I don't know, just scared. You, me, having to meet like this, everything. - Now that my scholarship at State is set, things will be different. When we get out of this small town, it'll just be me and you. Who cares about people? - You wanna take me with you? Promise, Eddie? - Of course. - I'll get a job as a waitress or something, and we'll get an apartment, and, do you think we can do it, Eddie? - I know we can. [motorcycles revving] - My brother! Run, Eddie, run! - I'm not afraid of your brother. - It's not only him! It's the rest of them too! - I'm not afraid of them. I can handle myself. - You don't know them! Get out while there's a chance! Hurry, please hurry! [chain rattles] - Sis. - Please don't hurt him, Moose! I won't see him again! Please leave him alone! - Bullshit. - Moose, please! - Get her out of here. [Jenny screams] - Run, Eddie, run! Run!

This bale right here? - All right. - That's ridiculous, talking to a damn goat. - [Man] You can get it. - [Man] Put it right here. - [Man] You can get it. - All right. [all clamoring] - Don't let it throw you, Boom Boom. - Where you want it? - Let's go. - [laughs] Hey man, both of y'all look anemic to me. You better go around the corner and get some of that goat's milk. [laughs] [laughing] - You gotta do better than that. - It's for you, man, here. - Awww, dag. You want it back? - What for? - You think you can do it? - [Man] Yeah, if you can. - Here. - Watch it, Frenchy! [Frenchy yelps] - Whoa! - Hey man, watch out for the goat. - Fellows, fellows! What happened? Is everything all right? - Yes ma'am. Stack just fell, that's all. - [laughs] My, oh my. - We'll house 'em right away. - Well hurry up fellas. Supper's on the table. - Hey man, food, food. - [laughs] Oh my, oh my. - Hey man! How am I gonna get down from here? - Try pole-vaulting with your tongue. - Oh, chump! [men murmuring] This is nice. - Ma'am, old Army chow was never like that. - Dig it. - Hope you fellas have enough room for some of my home-baked apple pie. [men murmuring] - Can I have the biggest piece, ma'am? [woman chuckles] - Now my Frank, God bless him, always used to say he kept an empty tooth ready and waiting for dessert. [men laugh] - This was really good, ma'am. - Here ya go, Kevin. - If you don't mind me asking, where are you from? - All around. - Yeah. We got no special place. Anywhere the wind takes us. - Good workers. I'd wish I could keep you on. - Appreciate that, ma'am. - But with Frank gone, things ain't as good as they used to be. - Thanks anyway, ma'am, but like, we don't have any roots really, and probably first time the wind blew, we'd be off with the dust. - Don't you have families? - Scattered here and there, ma'am. Scattered here and there. - Guess you could say the Army gave us a home, and we never gave it up. - My Frank was in the Army, and when he got back from the Pacific, he said he never wanted to travel off the land again. - Maybe he had something to come back to. - Well, you're all young and strong. Seems like you could get good jobs in the city. - Cities are trouble. - If I'd wanted to get mugged, I would've stayed in Saigon, mam. - Yeah, at least they got to jump to hit you in the head. [men chuckle] - But what about your future? Aren't you thinking about tomorrow? - There ain't no tomorrow. Just right now. We got our bikes, we got our 150 a month from Uncle Sam, but most of all, we ain't got no hassles. We got the open road, the country air, and the wind. But most of all, no hassles. [men murmuring] - Cool, man. - It was a hard day, man. I think we could all use a good night's sleep. - Yeah, I think we can, but let's try and find a place to call home. - Sorry I can't give you fellas more, but the bank account's about as busted as the boards on the barn out there. Maybe if you get around this way again, I'll have the money to give you to fix it. - Thank you, but speaking about the barn, do you mind if we bunk out there for the night? - My lands, of course not. You may find it a little drafty, though. You need blankets or anything? - Nah, we're like a carnival. We carry everything with us. Thank you. - Oh, excuse me, ma'am. [woman laughs] It's real good pie. Thank you. [rooster crows] [motorcycles revving] - Bye! - Just saw that bunch of Negroes drive out of here. Is everything all right? - Course, why? - Well, I thought I'd better check and make sure. You know how they are. - Yes. I know how they are. [upbeat funk music] - Hey, let's check this place out up ahead. - Okay, all right, over to the right. - Flora's Truck and Beer Stop, I've never drank a truck, but I'll try anything once. [chuckles] [light country music] - [Man] What kind of a place is this? - Looks like Pat Combs' place living in Saigon. [men laugh] - These place the same only the face ain't changed. - Uh oh. - Watch it. - What'll ya have? - Got any beer? - That's what the sign says. Flora's Truck and Beer Stop. - I'll have a ham sandwich and some beer. - Out of ham. - That's the strangest looking turkey I've ever seen. - And what kind of beer? - You got any Millers? - No Millers. - Pabst? - Hamm's? - Tunits? - Strauss? - Oly? - Nope. - Oh wow. - I'll tell you what, miss. We'll just have what that fella's drinking. - This is a man's drink. This a local brew. - In that case, give each of us two, and I'll take three. - Where are you boys from? I ain't seen you around here before. - Nah my boy, we're not from around here. Kidding me? - I could tell. Our Negroes have different places where they drink. - Yeah, I can't blame 'em much either, my boy. - We like it like that. They do too. It's just out-of-towners that cause trouble. - Yeah brother, I know what you mean. Like we have the same problem, you know, from out-of-towners. - Whatcha mean, boy? - Cat called me a boy, man, again. Well look here, man, see, from out-of-town honkies, whities, or crackers. They come down to our ghetto. You know, we're trying to live peaceful. I mean just cutting ourselves up now and then on Saturday night, I mean after we collect that welfare check. [laughs] Got to have that bread, y'know. See, they come down, honking their horns at them hos on the corner for 10-and-two, selling us that dope, you know, stuff like that that them out-of-towners bring. Like, they cause a whole lot of trouble, brother. I know just what you mean. - I think you're a little out of line, boy. - Hey man, just take it easy. - Well he's got a big mouth. People around here don't want no trouble. - Not me. - It's bootheads like you that cause all the stink. - Hey man, I'm really sorry, man. That's the last thing I wanna do is cause you folks no trouble. We just some happy niggas. Loves to dance and sing, loves to eat that chicken and watermelon. In fact, I'm gonna play a song for you right now. Yeah, this is the one. [bluesy jazz music] Ah yeah. - Now look, you better get him outta here before we throw him out. - All right, that's it. Get outta here! [bikers laugh] Just get out! - What did I do? - You just get out! - Yes ma'am, as soon as I finish my beer and listen to the rest of my song. - Your song's over, nigga. Better do what the lady says. Now. - Better get your black ass outta here! - That's a lady? Well, I tell you what. As soon as you find me a lady, I might do like she says. You know, you sure are fat and ugly, lady. - You can't talk to my wife like that! - Then tell her to stay outta my face, man! - No, Flora. - [Flora] Jeff, do something! Don't just stand there! Do something! - Now Flora, calm down. They didn't mean any harm. [all shouting] - Kill him! [Flora screams] [bikers laugh] - Look, it's cute. - Gorgeous, ain't he? [Flora screams] - They're crazy, they're crazy! They're wrecking my place! - Peace and love, brother. Peace and love. [laughs] [Flora screams] Peace and love, brother. Peace and love. - [Flora] Look what you've done to my place! [Flora screams] [bikers laugh] [Flora screams] - Niggers! Niggers! You dirty niggers! - Oh man. [Flora screams] - [Flora] Look what you've done! Who's gonna pay for this? [bikers murmur and chuckle] - I think that should take care of that, man. - Dirty niggers! Look what you've done! You wrecked my place, you wrecked my place. Who's gonna pay for this? [walls breaking] [Flora screams] [upbeat funk music] - [Man] Wow, man. - [Man] What a ride. How much further? - About 40 miles I think, man. - Hey, look. I'm gonna go over to the post office for a minute. - All right, fine. - Yes? - Here, I'll get it. - Say, my man. - Paint job. - My choke. I don't know whether it's the gas or what. Could you take a look at it? [light funk music] - [Woman] Can I help you? - [Bubba] Yeah. You got anything for Bubba Daniels? General delivery. - [Woman] I'll see. Bubba Daniels. Daniels, Daniels. Oh yeah, here's one for you. - [Bubba] Right. Thanks. - [Mama] I don't know when or if you'll get this letter, but as you can read by the paper, your brother's dead. They say they don't know who did it. We miss you, son. Do you think you'll be coming home soon? Mama. [motorcycle revs] - You ready, man? - Huh? - I said are you ready, man? What's the matter? Damn. Frenchy, Check this out, man. What're you gonna do? - Go on back. - That's a bad piece of road, man. - Ain't no easy road. - That's cracker country, man. You better bring your own ropes with you. - Yeah, but I gotta go, man. - [Frenchy] Why, man? I thought you left that mess behind you. - Down there, man, black's bad enough, but black bikers, that's worse. - That little sheriff would probably run you down the moment you hit town. I wouldn't go back there. - Who's asking you to? It's my problem. - Wait a minute. Let's get our things together, all right? Are you going back there looking for trouble? 'Cause if you are, we don't wanna be part of it. - Trouble? That's the last thing I want is trouble. - Then what are you going back there for, man? - I remember once some no-name town in 'Nam. A mother was holding her dead kid in her arms. Can't forget that face. It's gotta be the same face my momma's wearing right now. Tell you what. Why don't you guys riding up into Colorado? I'll get my business straight, and meet you up there in about a month or so. - Say, Bubba. You'd never find us there. Your sense of direction is horrible. - Anyway, I like your part of the country. Got the greenest trees you'll ever see. - Well, let's go see 'em then. - Peace and love, brothers. Peace and love. [motorcycles revving] [upbeat funk music] [dog barking] - Want more coffee? - No, Mama. - How was the dinner? - Oh, real good Mama, really good. You've grown up, Sissy. My little sister's all grown up. - She's going to college next year. - Hey that's good, Sissy. I sometimes wish I had gone. - You could've. Chose the army instead. - You do what you think's best. I got no regrets. - [Sissy] Then you got nothing else either. - Sissy! You don't talk to your brother like that. - It's okay, Mama. I got my freedom. That's what I think I fought for, and that's all I want. - What about my freedom? And everybody else's? You ain't got no freedom. You're a cop-out. - Hey, I don't wanna get into a family argument, but a man has a right to do whatever he thinks is right for himself. - If you wanted to go around waving a banner, jumping up and down, ranting and raving, that's your privilege. But we all have different ways of doing what we think is right for ourselves. - You are living in a dream world. The real world says when you hurt my brother, I feel the pain, and if I feel the pain, I'm gonna do something about it, and if it means jumping up and down, then you watch this sister jump. You just be careful who she lands on. And just what are you gonna do about Eddie? - Just what am I supposed to do? I didn't come back here looking for any trouble. Just want peace. - You know what you are? All of you. You are Uncle Toms. Not the old Uncle Toms, no. You're a brand new breed. And if you keep looking the other way long enough, you know what you're gonna see? Nothing. And that's like super beautiful, because there's nothing else for you to do but go right on, blind and beautiful. - Sissy, please! That's enough. - You're right, Mama, that's enough. Their world is dead. There's a new thing happening, new and beautiful, they haven't got any place in it. You're just a bad memory. A dead memory. [door closes] [sighing] - Hey, man. Like, you have one heavy-lipped sister. [light sad music] - Who killed Eddie, Mama? - I don't know, son. - Don't they have any idea? - If they do, they ain't saying. - Somebody must know something. - [Mama] I reckon. [sighing] - I think I'll go to bed. - Bubba, what's in your head? - I gotta nose around a little bit. - Leave it alone, Bubba. Let the police take care of it. It ain't nothing but trouble. - I'm used to it. - You'll end up like Eddie. I ain't got nobody left but you and Sissy. Nothing else matters much. - Sissy. She doesn't even know me. She calls me Uncle Tom. - What do you expect? You've been gone five years. You're a stranger to her. You're a stranger to me, son. - Yeah. Good night, Mama. - Bubba, are you gonna stay home this time? - I don't know. Got a lot of questions that need answering. I don't know. Did Ceal get married? - I ain't seen her. [light sad music] - [Jenny] You, me, having to meet like this, everything. You will take me with you? Promise, Eddie? - [Eddie] Of course. - [Jenny] I'll get a job as a waitress or something. Do you think we can do it, Eddie? - [Eddie] I know we can. - [Jenny] My brother! Run, Eddie, run! - [Eddie] I'm not afraid of your brother. I'm not afraid of them. I can handle myself. - [Jenny] You don't know them! - [Coach] How ya been, Bubba? - [Bubba] Fine, Coach. - [Coach] Been a long time, look like you've put on a couple pounds. Army must've fed you good. - They fed me often. - Sorry about what happened to your brother. Damn shame. You know, that kid was almost as good as you were, could kick a field goal 50 yards. You know that? You couldn't do that on your best day. - Any idea who killed him? - Kid would've made a heck of a pro. State signed him right up. Plenty of opportunities out there. And they say there haven't been any changes. Been plenty of changes. Football, basketball, baseball. Things are open. Wide open. You can make all that big money, providing you got a little bit of talent. - But about Eddie, Coach- - Eddie would've made a great pro, and you could've done the same thing, Bubba. You could've been a big man, really big. - Maybe you're right. Who knows. But about Eddie, Coach, you have any idea of what happened? - Only what I read in the papers. - Well, there must've been some rumors. - Rumors? Never deal with rumors, I leave that to the police. They deal in facts. Just like in my business, I deal in facts. Hit 'em hard, and hit 'em low. Knock 'em right off their feet, remember? - Yeah, I remember. - Want facts, you gotta go to the police. [upbeat funk music] Well, I gotta get back to the boys. Stop in and see me again sometime, Bubba. Good seeing ya. - Thanks anyway, Coach. [motorcycles revving] [tires screeching] [typewriter clacking] [door closes] [police radio chattering] - Can I help you? - I'm Bubba Daniels. I'd like some information about my brother, Eddie. - Eddie Daniels? - That's right. - That would be Detective Octavias. - Yes, Mr. Daniels, may I help you? Bill, would you sit in on this? - It's about my brother's death. What can you tell me? - There's not much to tell. It's all in here, really not much more than what the papers have. Right? - Yes, sir. Just what you've got there, that's all we've got. - It's all we've got on it. He was beaten to death with chains and other heavy objects. - Well, you must have talked to people. Somebody must know something. - Well, if they do, they haven't told us anything. Mr. Daniels, when it comes to talking with the police, you've got a very quiet community. It's like walking around on an oyster bed. Everything's shut up tight. People won't even give us their right names. - Well, maybe it was somebody outside of the community. - Possibly. A series of tire tracks on the field. - Bikes? - [Octavias] Seems so. - Well it seems to me, if you put chains and clubs and bike tracks together, you don't have far to look. - It's not that easy. First of all, kids. They like to ride on the field at night. They race on the track. No, it's too hard to tie in. Right, Bill? - Yes, sir. Kids play around this place all the time. - But what about the local bike gangs? - They're harder to get to than your people. They hate us worse than you do. Present company excluded, right Bill? - Yes, sir. - Now, we've covered all that. Most of the gang members were out of town about the time that it happened, and those that were here, they didn't seem to know anything. - Yeah, well thanks for nothing. It's about what I expected anyway. - Mr. Daniels. This may come as a shock to you, but we've done everything we can. We're still trying. Now, this department doesn't give a damn who committed the crime or who it was committed against. Our job is to apprehend and prosecute, and the records show we do just that. Would you agree with that, Bill? - Yes, sir. Absolutely. - Yeah, thanks again. - Mr. Daniels. I suggest that you let us handle this? We are not only equipped, but we are very well prepared. - Yeah, but so far, you haven't done very much, have you? Isn't that right, Bill? [upbeat funk music] Fat Jim! - Hey! Where you been hiding, man? I ain't seen you since 30 pounds ago! - Here and there, man. You know how it is. - Sorry to hear about your brother, man. - Can you tell me anything? - Wish I could, man, but I'm stuck in this bar half my life. - Hey man, you must've heard something over the bar. - Uh-Uh. If it ain't in the racing forums, I don't talk about it. - Hey, people scared to talk about it? - Hey, I ain't scared, man. I just like to mind my own business. I run a peaceful bar, and I live a peaceful life. - You seen Ceal? Hey man, you remember Ceal. She used to come in with me all the time. - Yeah, I remember her. - Well, she been around? - Hey man, I really don't know. - Oh man, why don't you tell the man? - Hey, why don't you drink your beer and shut up? - Hey, buy you one? - Yeah, don't care if ya do. - Fats, give the man a beer. Hey, what should he talk to me about? - Everybody round here is just scared, and I ain't scared. Damn hoodlums don't scare me none! - Tell me something. - Yeah, I heard about that old girlfriend of yours. Said she married some dude. Hoo-ustlin. He ain't no good. But he calls himself Copperhead. [laughing] - Where can I find him? - He say he does his business down at the Walker Johnson Pool and Binge Bar. - Thanks. - Here. - Yeah? Fats. - I can tell you who did it. Damn white motorcycle bikers got him, sure in hell! If everybody around here's just scared to say so. You find out who that white trash broad your brother was running around with, you'll find out who killed your brother. - Man don't know what he's talking about, man. That's just a rumor. - Rumors, my butt! Now, that's fact! Don't nobody ever want to look at facts. You show a man a fact, and he'd run like a striped-ass ape! Find the girl, man. Get your facts. - Hey, man. You got a big mouth. You don't own nothing, but you do have a big, fat mouth. - Do it any time, and any place. Always have, and always will. - Hey, pop. - You talking to me? - Yeah, pop. You always been so brave, flapping them pork-chop lips, hmm? - I don't call it being brave to say what you think. And you have a little more respect for your elders, mustard-ass! - Well, if you always been so big, so bad, where were you and your big mouth 30 years ago? [group chattering] [pool balls clacking] - Haha, I got the stripe in, lordy yeah! - Copperhead? - Say what? - Your name is Copperhead, isn't it? Jimmy Anderson, hey you're Jimmy Anderson. - Copperhead, the third son of Abba Ben Fahoo, the daughter of Kashmir Cut d'Cocoa, and the living son of Alibaba Muhammad the 3rd! And worthy my sconey. [pool balls clacking] - Don't you remember me, man? Bubba Daniels. - Back in your high school days, ra ra. Catch that pass, hit that line, all that jive ass shit. [pool balls clacking] The army got you, didn't they? - Yeah. - That's nice, couldn't get in myself, got a bad eardrum. And I wet the bed at night. It wouldn't do you no good pissin up whitey's blankets. Want a game? Shoot a little nine ball. - I don't play the game. Well, what'd you call me for? - Just wanted to ask you about Ceal? - What about her? - You marry her? [loud laughing] - Man that's funny. - What's so funny? I said what's so funny? - Nothin man, Copperhead marry her. - What else? - That's all. - Put him down, man. You got an argument you take it up with me. Don't be messin' with my friends. - Where's Ceal at? - She's out hustlin', so go blow smoke up your ass. [pool cue breaks] You broke my stick man, you crazy? Damn! Damn! - I asked you a question. Where's Ceal? - You'll find her at 22 4th Street upstairs rear. [all chattering] [funk music] [knocking on door] - Who is it? [knocking on door] Who is it? [knocking on door] Go away! - [Bubba] Ceal. - Who is it? - It's me Ceal, Bubba, Bubba Daniels. Let me in. - What the hell's going on here? Who the hell are you? - You, get your clothes and get out. - Like hell I will. I paid and I'm gonna get what I came in here for. - You better leave, Mister. - Damn lousy trick. I paid. I know what it's all about. You get a guy up here, take his money, then you roll him. That's it, go ahead shoot me! Oh no, I go for the money, you're gonna knife me. You think you're so tough. - What did you come back for? Why couldn't you just have stayed dead? - You got it wrong. My brother's dead not me. - Oh no, you're dead. You died for me four years ago. You died the day you left. What did you come back for? - Come on, get dressed, I'm gonna take you out of here. - Uh uh, I like it fine right here. - Come on. - Please Bubba, leave me alone. Please do not start it all up again. I can't take it. - Come on baby, no more of this okay? Come on. - And when you didn't come back after you got out of the army, well, nothing mattered anymore. I just sort of fell to pieces. I just went from bad to worse sliding further and further down the tunnel. Well that's when I met Copperhead. The rest you know and saw. - It's been about the same with me. I've been sliding down that same tunnel. Still am, what can you tell me about Eddy? - Well I saw him the day before he, with the girl he was going with. - The white girl? - Yeah, Jenny King. - Who killed him? - [Ceal] A lot of people have asked but nobody's talking. It has to do with her I suppose but, nobody's gonna come right out and say so. - Where can I find her? - Bubba look, why don't you just leave it alone? - She might know something. - It's her brother. They say he leads a pretty bad bunch of motorcycle riders. Moose. Well, don't look at me like that I'm just repeating what I hear. Whitey likes to come up in my room and tell me how big and strong he is. - Police must know this. - Well if they do they're not too anxious to tackle that gang. Bubba look they are mean and there are a lot of them. - Where can I find her? - Bubba look- - Where? [sighing] - Okay, she works as a waitress in a little dive in Minlow. It's a biker's hangout. - Come on, I'm gonna take you over to my mother's place. - Bubba, what are you going to do? - Just have a talk with the lady, okay? [motorcycle revs] [group chattering] [motorcycle engines running] - Where's Bubba? I thought he was with you. - We thought he was here with you Mrs. Daniels. - Do you know where the Silver Spur is? - No, we never heard of it, why? - I think you'd better get right down there. Oh never mind I'll show you. - That's a solid. [funk music] [all chattering] - Yeah? - You Jenny? - Yeah, why? - I understand you were a friend of Eddie Daniels. - You want beer, pretzels, sandwiches, you got it. That's all I serve. - I want information, Jenny. - Who are you anyway? - Eddie's brother. - Listen, I can't talk to you now. I've work to do. - Well when can you talk to me? - I have nothing to say. Why don't you leave me alone? - A glass of suds, Jenny. [funk music] - Jenny, beer. [all chattering] Talk to me. - I've got nothing to say, why don't you leave? Please leave me alone. - Who killed Eddie? - [sobbing] Please leave me alone. - What's wrong? - Nothing! - He bothering you? - Please, please forget it. - You got a problem man? - Man, I was born with a problem. - Yeah well this aint a nice place to bring 'em. What do you want here? - I wanna talk to Jenny about my brother. - All the brothers are on the other side of town. - Not mine. - Please leave him alone, Get out! Go! - Seems like everywhere I'm at, somebody's always askin me to go. - Look, we're not askin ya, we're tellin' ya, you leaving? - No. [bottleneck breaks] - Put that damn thing down. [dramatic music] Just relax. You Bubba? - Yeah. - Heard you been suckin' around, lookin for me? - [Bubba] That's right. - Well you found me, what do you want? - You know what I want. - I suppose. - You the guys that did it? - You know, you'd have been a lot better off if you would've stayed where you were. But you pushed til there ain't now way of moving back no more. Now you blew it. - Are you the guy? - Looks like it's gonna rain. Lot's of black clouds. - Do I get an answer to my question? - Up your exhaust pipe, mutha. - [Biker] No man, no, no. No man, no, no. - No trouble, remember? - [Moose] He ain't worth it. - [Biker] Cool it, cool it. - You boys havin a party? Was it just gettin' started? All right let's break it up. I'm comin' back here in 20 minutes. I don't want to find anybody here. - 20 minutes. [light funk music] [funk music] [motorcycle engines roaring] [crickets chirping] - Brother Thor. - Brother, hit? - That's heavy. - What's happenin', man? - We got a little problem. - And you need some help from your friends? - Yeah it ain't no big thing, but I want it done right. - Lay it on me. - Remember the boothead that got burned a while back? - Yeah, down and dirty. - His brother's been in town and stinkin' up the place. They came in the bar lookin for a rumble. - Man, you can't handle that you oughta low ride. - That ain't where it's at, man. These guys ain't normal spooks. They could be bad trouble. - Can't your club handle it? - We could handle it but we couldn't do it justice. - Meanin'? - Meanin' I want 'em put down, way down. - Now we've been partying with your club many times, how many guys you need? - All my men'll be there. - Yeah that's a heavy scene. - I mean it to be. I want the word to get out. I'm tired of spooks with white chicks strollin' up and down the avenue and flauntin' their black asses and challengin' you to do somethin' about it. It's time somethin' was done and I want it to come down so heavy that they'll talk about it forever. No more runnin', the white man is tired of runnin'. They've got to learn that they've pushed too far. And when you push a man too far, one day he's gonna turn around and beat your brains out. - You're gonna deep burn brother, amen. We'll ride with you guys. I ain't thumped a head in about a week. Girl, give me that pipe. I'm gonna get my brother high up on a cloud, up in the fleecy white clouds. [motorcycle engine roaring] [funk music] [blues guitar music] [motorcycle engine roaring] [funk music] [blues guitar music] [motorcycle engine roaring] [funk music] [blues guitar music] - [Ceal] You've changed, Bubba. - [Bubba] Nothin stays the same, everything changes. - [Ceal] Why didn't you come back after you got out of the army? - To what, the same things that were here before I left? - Nothing stays the same. Everything changes, remember? - Every place but Cottonwood Road. - Well I was here and I didn't change. Maybe the only thing that was different was you. - Well, we just fought a strange kind of war. Mud and rain, livin like a mole in the ground. Some stink place I didn't wanna be. I didn't even know who I was fighting. But I know one thing, I'm tired of fighting because nobody cares. Nobody gives you nothin. - Well they never did. You have to work and fight for everything you get. Well let somebody else fight it. I had my war and I didn't come back here to exchange it for another one. If people want to fight in the street, cool. Let 'em stretch out and do their thing. But old Bubba, no way. I'm not out to change the world and I don't want it to change me. I just want to be left alone, mellow, that's all. - I missed you so much, Bubba. I wanted you so bad. I had no way of making the pain go away, the pain that was so deep inside of me. And it didn't end with the mornings. It just grew all day and returned to torture me at night. And the longer you stayed away well, the worse it got. Then I didn't care anymore. No joy, no sorrows, no nothing. I was just a lot of empty flesh walking around with no feelings. Eyes that don't see and ears that don't hear. Life is just a lot of pictures passing you by in the night. I see nothing, no meanings. And then one day you wake up in a rat hole of hotel with some whiskey-breath old man lying beside you and $5 in your hand and you wonder where in the hell have you been all you life. Bubba? - Yeah? - Love me. - I can't, I've no love to give. [motorcycles revving] - You're the one. You're the kid's brother? - What do you want? - You dudes, you raised a lot of stink around here. You can't go around threatenin' people. [clicking tongue] I mean it just ain't civilized. - Man, you got somethin' to say, say it. - I'm gonna, I'm gonna. Now you guys, you did a real bad number. You're threatenin' people. You gon do this, you gon do that. - I want Jenny's brother and the bunch he rides with. - I run with him, I run right next to him all the time. [funk music] - Not yet, Bubba. Not yet. - Thanks, I needed that. - You talkin', or leavin? - No, I'm gonna do a little talkin'. Moose, Jenny's brother, he wants to see you guys. He wants to see ya, talk things out, rap a little bit. Now I'm bleedin' how about that? - Hey man, your ass is gonna be bleeding if you don't get on with it. - Well uh, he wants to talk to you guys. - When? - Anytime you want to. Now is all right. - Let's go. [funk music] - We'll be puttin' down the road. [motorcycles revving] Dangit, motherfucker! [funk music] - What's going on, what's wrong? - Mama. - What is it Bubba, what's happening? - Nothing Mama, just goin for a moonlight ride. - I swear you had me scared to death. You be comin' home, Bubba? You be comin' home? - I never left home, Mama. - Bubba, Bubba wait. Bubba, Bubba don't go. - This is what you wanted, wasn't it? - I don't want you to go out and get killed. - Everybody dies. - Bubba, don't go, they'll kill you. - I'm livin in a dream world. You said it, remember? A new breed of Uncle Tom. There comes a time when you have to stand up and deal with what you know is right. I tried to hide from it, run, keep my peace but it just ain't that way. When a man runs from trouble he just runs to it. - Bubba, this is no fight, this is suicide. - No Sissy, it's just a man too tired to fight and if life ain't no more than this, it ain't worth livin anyhow. You see, Sissy, I'm just plain tired. You understand? - I understand, but what about them? [funk music] - They got their own thing to do but I've got to go, Sissy. He was my brother. - Bubba. - We tried, they pushed 'em. We're all brothers. [funk music] [dramatic percussive music] - I didn't think you had the guts. - [Bubba] You killed him, didn't you? - I burned his ugly black ass. [intense funk music] [chains rustling] [agonizingly screams] - Thor! Thor, Thor, Thor! - What the hell is goin on down there, man? - Man it's happening man, Moose is dead. They're all dead, they've all been killed, man - [Thor] Ah shoot. [engines roaring] - [Bubba] All right let's go, let's get these bodies outta here, come on. - [Biker] They comin' down man, they comin' down. - [Bubba] Better hurry, better hurry man let's go. - [Biker] Come out, somebody gimme a hand. - [Bubba] All right, I got you. - Let's get us some black meat. [engines roaring] [chains rattling] [chains rattling] [all yelling] [screaming] Goddammit, let's burn 'em out. [all yelling] [screaming] What the hell did you get me into here? - I'll get him, I'll get him. He's gonna burn, baby, burn. - [Bubba] Hey watch out, that guy's coming over here. He's got a flare on his tank. He watch it, look out! [bike explodes loudly] [bike explodes loudly] [bike explodes loudly] [bike explodes loudly] [bike explodes loudly] [upbeat funk music]
