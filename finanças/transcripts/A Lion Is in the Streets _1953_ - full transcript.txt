Oh! There you go. Run on, honey. Run on. Here's your sweater. You can sit over there. I'll get the blankets. Boys, stop that now. Here we are. Come on. Girls, stop that running. All right. Here. Oh! What you doing down there, huh? What you doing down there? Gonna shake some of that off of you now. Come on. Get up there. There's my girl! There! Well, come on. Gonna put you right in there. Come on! Who all is that down there? Why, you must be one of the Graingers' girls. I bet you're Lukisha. There's my girl! There! Well, come on. Who all is that down there? Hank! Hank! Hank! Hey! Children, children, into the class. - Here. Let me get you warm. - Well, well! Johnny Briscoe. How's your pa and ma? - Fine. - Yeah. And Mary Lou and Emma! Ain't you got pretty, though? And you -- Oh, you just got to be Beanpole Simpson's boy. Children, children, this is a class. Ah. Now, look here. Everybody under four feet tall who ain't in his seat or her seat by the time I count three, you know what happens. One! Two! Ah! Three. You made it. That's better. Now turn to page 18. You don't know me, ma'am, but I saw you up at Lotus City a couple of weeks ago. Ah. You're from Pennsylvania. And you've been to a college. Elmer, you go on reading. Yeah, you know, it's about time we had people like you -- fine, high-type college people to teach our kids. I, uh, I know some men who have been to college, but never a tall, lean beauty of a girl. Uh, I never met such a girl, leastwise one that's been to college. You're a -- You're a peddler? Ma'am, I'm Hank Martin. Also, I peddle. We don't have rain like this up north. Well, uh, according to something I read from the US. Department of Agriculture, we have about, oh, on an average of 55 inches per inum. Annum. - "Annum"? - Mm-hmm. Thank you. Well, I'll be back this way in a couple of months from now. The roads will be dry by then, and I'll be using my truck. Do you have any toothpaste? Uh.. Yeah. Yeah. Pearly. Oh, it's, uh, it's kind of nice-tasting. So long. I-I really need some toothpaste. I'm almost out. Well, ma'am, to tell you the truth, Pearly is really second-rate stuff. And for you... everything has to be strictly first-class. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Bye! ♪ Oh, I met the girl I love ♪ ♪ The girl I am going to marry ♪ ♪ I met the girl I love ♪ ♪ The girl I am going to marry ♪ Oh, no. Wait a minute. Maybe -- Maybe she's got a fella already.

Oh, now, hold on. Hold on, Sweetface. This ain't for us. This is Jules Bolduc's manor house. - Oh. - ah. Oh, Jules! Jules! Hank Martin! Oh, Hank. Go right in. Take anything you want. The servants must still be at church. I'm always borrowing his law books and historical books. His grandfather was governor of this state. Say, Jules! I want to rent a house from you. For cash money. I don't plan on taking up sharecropping at this stage of the game. That house the Wisters used to live in is vacant -- only one. What's the matter? You finally get tired of living in that truck? No. I need a place for me and my bride. Your what? Since early this morning. Verity, meet Jules Bolduc. - Hello. - How do you do? Oh, Hank -- uh, congratulations, Hank. Uh, come to dinner tonight, you and Mrs. Martin. Well, thank you, Jules. Thank you kindly. - We sure will. - Tonight, then. We'll make it an early evening. Bye. Quite a thing to be asked to supper by Jules Bolduc, Esquire. I ain't never. Oh, uh, there's a couple of those government-built sharecropper houses hereabouts, but, uh, as you heard, Sweetface, uh, they're -- they're all taken right now. You know, uh, we could make our home base someplace else, but that, uh, that library of Jules' is... Oh, Sweetface. I never saved no money. Never saved no money at all. It's gonna be all right, Hank.

Sweetface! Hank, I'm not presentable. I want you to meet some fellow citizens, and it's important that they like my wife. Friends, folksies, this is Verity. Well, it's -- it's nice to meet all of you folks. I-I only wish that I... Well, the least I can do is make us all a pot of tea. Won't you -- Oh, they didn't come here to have you do for them. I caught them coming out of church full of that once-a-week Christian feeling. All right, folksies, shake the leg. Get your brushes, your paint, your whitewash right here. You name it, I got it. - How do you do, Mrs. Martin? - Oh, hello. Where you want I should put the barbecue pit? - Uh, why, I -- - Over there, Sophie, downwind. Tim? Tim? This here -- This here big horned toad is our blacksmith. Name of Tim Peck. And, uh, this, of course, is Sophie. Tim, uh, in addition to being our blacksmith, does a little politickin' on the side. Kind of helps get out the vote. Uh, what you'd call a one-man Tammany Hall, only not quite so honest. Right proud to know you, ma'am. Thank you. Hank's always joking at him and always get a rise. This is Jennie Brown. "Poor Jennie," we call her, on account of what she married -- Jeb Brown. The only man in the entire county who never had had a good year. That's sure right. Nor my father afore me. Sort of tradition. Well, now, come on, everybody. Everything has to be finished and perfect by sundown, or I don't get no honeymoon at all. Never thought I'd be running my legs off for another man's bridal night. You didn't for your own, Jeb Brown. Hank, what color Mrs. Martin want her floor? - How about brown? - Uh, how about yellow? - Nice, pretty yellow floor. - Green! That's what God's floor is. Uh, yeah, Hank. Green. A-A nice dark green. - All right. Dark green. - Green. Uh, Sweetface, now, this here squab -- don't let him fool you -- this is Swift. Probably the oldest bachelor in the entire state or maybe the entire world. And mean -- real mean. Now, uh, can't see to button his own shirt but can shoot the eye out of a squirrel at over 200 yards and maybe more. It's mighty troublesome. I can't see proper at speaking distance or hear proper at seeing distance. Well, it was nice you could come, Mr. Swift. I-It's an honor, ma'am. And someday I'll have glasses. Sweetface. Sweetface! You crying? Oh, Hank, it's -- it's these folks. They're all so wonderful. Well, all folks is wonderful if you just happen to know the right place to kick 'em in. - What? - Sure. It's like learning to play a music instrument by ear. All you got to know is what place to push to get what note. Then, pretty soon, everybody's dancing to your tune. Why, Hank, I-I don't think you mean that. Huh. Well, anyway, honeymoon ain't the time for thinkin' anyway. Oh, Sweetface, what happened to that, uh, that law book of Jules -- you know, the big fat blue one? Oh, you're not gonna read now? Yeah. It's the groom and his bride. What are you two doing up? Just managed to get an invite for supper with Jules Bolduc, Esquire. Marry a college girl, and up you go in the world. "Oh, uh, my dear, don't you find the caviar awfully tough?" "Well, uh, Jules, old boy, would you mind having one of your serving maids chew it up smaller for me? Thank you." Aw, Hank, you know Jules ain't that way. Oh, uh, electioning early this year, huh, Tim? It ain't never too early to start getting a good man back into office. Good man? Hank, you know dang well that Governor Snowden's a good man. Uh-huh. "Re-elect a man who, in his four years as governor, has built more than 500 miles of paved roads." Now, ain't that -- ain't that great? Five hundred miles and pretty soon the whole state. The whole state will be floating down in the rain before they get the roads built. Hank, you know Rome wasn't built in a day. Mm-hmm. To coin a phrase. Now, sharecroppers, you may carry your betters over to the door of Mr. Jules Bolduc's residence! Oh, Hank. Come on, Tim! Up, big man. Here we go! Now, mind you! Mind you, carry her gentle. I ain't through with her yet. Excruciatingly, Lord Chumley. Although it seems to me that buckwheat is as rough as a billy goat. Castleberry. Castleberry. What is it? What's the matter? Sweetface, this is one eating party that's gonna get along without us. Oh, we can't. It's -- It's rude. Rude? W-- Sweetface, look at this here. You see this skinny, scrawny little arm, which should be rich and round and fat? Well, you know where that fat went to? You know who stole it all from little Lucy Brown's arm? Robert L. Castleberry IV, who has this whole county in his thievin' pocket! That's what I call rude. Oh, little Lucy, I didn't mean you no harm. I think you're as pretty as a picture. Hank, I got to say I disbelieve about Castleberry having the whole county in his pocket. What's more, I disbelieve that he's a thief. Leastways, it ain't never been proved yet. Well, I guess I just kind of lost my appetite anyway. I don't understand all this, but the least we can do is let Mr. Bolduc know -- send some excuse. Verity, this ain't just some little thing. Castleberry owns a lot of cotton gins. He's the only one hereabouts we can sell our cotton to, and he cheats us by short-weighing. Everybody knows it. Most everybody. - Sure has. - That's a fact, Mrs. Martin. Well, then, I-I'll say we can't come. I'll tell him you're ill. Oh, now, hold on. I'll do my own apologizing. Sophie, save some of that corned pork roast. Me and Verity are having supper with you and Tim if you'll have us. We'll be right proud to have you, Hank. I used to hear things like this from my schoolchildren. The poor always prefer to think they're that way because someone's cheating them. You know, Hank, there's a book I'll get you one day on the true cause of poverty in these parts. That'll be plumb fascinating. Plumb fascinating. Welcome to Cypress Bend, Mrs. Martin. - Jules, I'm sorry. - Thank you. - Congratulations, Hank. - We just came by to, uh -- - Listen. I -- - Robert! Robert! I want you to meet the guests of honor. You married a remarkable man, Mrs. Martin. - He's always reproached me. - Reproached? Well, because first, although I'm a lawyer and he isn't, I think he's read more law than I have. And secondly because he suddenly made me regret being a bachelor. Thank you. Oh, uh, Mrs. Martin, Mr. Castleberry. - How do you do, sir? - Excuse me, ma'am. But it's sort of a belief of mine not to shake hands. And Mr. Martin. What kind of a belief is that, Castleberry, not to shake hands? Hank, Robert has some rather strange ideas. It may have escaped your notice, sir, but one of the ways disease is communicated is by shaking hands. Disease? Is that what's worrying you? Mr. Bolduc, I think this is the most beautiful home I've ever seen. Castleberry, there's a disease called pellagra. Did you ever hear how that's communicated? Hank, we were talking about the house. It's communicated by not getting enough to eat. And it's very common in counties where your cotton gins are. Jules, I'm very sorry. I don't mean any offense to you. But my wife and I can't eat with a man what's been communicating pellagra. - Well, I don't -- - I think I do. Would you mind explaining your remark, sir? Not at all, sir. - I'm calling you a thief. - Hank. And come to think of it, not just an ordinary thief. - A bloodsucking thief. - Hank, that's enough! You know very well there's a state inspection board which takes care of those things. What I want to know is who inspects the inspectors. Governor Charles Snowden inspects the inspectors. He's self-made, just like you, and he's my friend. And he's honest. As is Robert Castleberry, who also happens to be my godfather. Well, Jules, I never had no godfather. And I was almost too poor to have a father. So I must be wrong, and you must be very, very right. Well, sorry, Jules, to be spoiling your eating party. Martin. Or whatever your name is. Martin! Martin! You got it just right. M-A-R-T-I-N! I give you fair warning. If you ever make such statements again to a living soul, I will swear out a warrant for your arrest on a charge of criminal libel. Criminal libel, sir, can get you five years on the chain gang. Can it, sir? Well, now, ain't that funny? I've been reading up a lot about criminal libel in Jules' law books. And five years is right, all right -- lessin' if it happens to be true, which it is. I have warned you. Um, Castleberry, I suppose Moses here counts as a living soul, don't he? Moses... Robert L. Castleberry IV is a thief, and the weights he uses in his cotton gins weigh short. Now, Castleberry, go ahead. Swear out your warrant. I will, sir. I assure you I will. I'd like to use your telephone, Jules. I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Bolduc. I'm sure everything will be all right. He's quite a fellow. I-I know you'll be very happy. Yes. Never knowed I could love anybody or anything so much. That's the way I feel too. That wasn't no mating call. That was just to let the folks know that Hank is here. What an incredible part of the country. How could people live in this feverish wilderness? Plumb scarifying, ain't it? You know, you've seen enough misery in the last three weeks to last you a lifetime, and yet you've never complained. I love that silly face. "Like to a palm tree." What? "Thy stature is like to a palm tree." That means long and straight. Song of Solomon, from the Bible. Hank! Yo, Hank! Yo, Hank! Hiya, Spurge! You're plumb two months ahead of time this year! I'm making my rounds early this year. I had to get out of my home county. There's a warrant out for me. Hank? Hank, you're back! Flamingo! My little sweetheart! Spurge's daughter. Knowed her since she was a baby. Hank? - You bring that tonic? - Yes, Miss LeFevre. I got your tonic. I got everything. Like I always say, you name it... l got it. Spurge, Spurge! Miss McManamee! Ah! Honey! My baby, baby. - Hank! - My baby, baby, baby! - Aw, Hank! - Leave him be, girl! Spurge, it's wonderful to see you! And, Mrs. McManamee, you're looking younger every day. - Here you are. - Who all is that? Who is it? Who is it? Folksies... this is Verity, who happens to have the miserablest misfortune of being my wife. You said you'd wait! You said you'd wait! You always -- You said you'd wait! Flamingo! Apologize to Mrs. Martin. Spurge, Spurge, no. This is all my fault. I've been calling her sweetheart since she was a little baby. Spurge, you got to make allowances! Apologize! I.. Apologize. Mrs. Martin... we're mighty proud to meet Hank's new wife. - Mighty proud. - Thank you. I guess you'uns can both squeeze into my boat with Lula May and me. There's lots of room in my boat. Why, you little old wildcat. I wouldn't let no wife of mine ride in any boat with you. Leastways not my number-one wife. I made a fool, plumb fool, minutes ago. There'd be lots less talk and gossip if you'd ride with me, ma'am. We'd be beholden to you, ma'am, if you would. Wouldn't we, Flamingo? Real deep beholden. Come on, Hank! You got a lot of good customers waiting at the settlement for you. You're a right generous lady, Mrs. Martin. Now, uh, take good care of her, Flamingo. - Good care! - She will, Hank. She's carrying my pocketbook for me. What beautiful birds. They're flamingos. I've never seen any before. When I was born, they named me Sunny Lou. Till Hank come along one day and seen me swimming and diving. And he said, "With them long legs and that long neck, she's like to a wild flamingo." Hank named me. I understand. Really, I do. Why are you turning? Flamingo, where are you going? Give me that! Oh! Give -- Hank! Hank! Hank! Hank! Hank! Aah! Oh! Poke him in the throat! Poke him in the throat! Aah! Sweetface, you all right? I'm fine, but I think I'll need a doctor, Hank. It's -- It's my ribs. What are you doing in this slough, girl? It's my fault, Mr. McManamee. I-I wanted to come in here, and I stood up and tipped the boat over. It was Mrs. Martin's fault! Do you hear that, Spurge? Is that true, girl? Yes, Pa. Sweetface, I'm sending you home. And no more back talk. I'm sending you home. Reckon I'm beholden to you again. I reckon you are. And I hope you choke on it. Come on, Sweetface. Ooh! Hank. Hank? Flamingo. I asked the store man in Gregory. He thought you'd be along here somewhere. - Your folks know you're here? - No. Oh, no. Flamingo. I love my wife, Verity. I wouldn't let you go everywheres alone. Yeah, neither would she -- if somebody hadn't cracked her shoulder and three ribs. She sure heals slow. I'll make some coffee. I run away on account of you. I love you. I always loved you, and I always will. I'm going to Dodge City and be a beauty-shop girl -- hairdressing and such, like Mary Emma. And I'll always be there waiting in someplace like they got in the cities. A hotel or a room, someplace of my own. And I'll always be there waiting, belonging to you, like a mule in a barn. Girl, girl, girl. Right now I'm gonna stay here. I'm gonna stay with you a spell. Long as I can. You can't, Flamingo. You just can't. You don't know what you're saying. Besides, I'm on my way home. Uh, it's time I settle up a little bit of criminal-libel trouble I've been having. And you, you're going back to your family, where you belong. Hank" Hank, remember giving me this? Yeah. I've been giving away toy mouses this season. Ever since I've been old enough to know anything at all, since I was 11 or 12 playing with doll babies, playing mother to them, Hank... Hank, they always been your baby. Oh, there ain't no prettier girl anywhere. I've been your wife ever since I knowed what the word meant. No. Flamingo, you ain't been nowhere, seen nothing, don't know right from wrong. You don't know what you're saying. Now, you and me is wrong -- wrong to my wife, Verity, wrong to your ma and pa, who's friends of mine and trust me... wrong to you. If y-you tell me to go home, I'll go home. I'll do anything you say. Hello, Mrs. Martin. Hello, Jeb. Hello, Mr. Swift. Sweetface, Sweetface, Sweetface. Hank Oh! I missed you. Really missed you. Oh, I've been waiting all morning, ever since Swift came and told me. - You all healed? You all right? - Yes. Yes, I'm fine. Hank, did they tell you? Castleberry knows all about your plan. She's right, Hank. Somebody must have talked. Or maybe they just figured their first day of ginning -- Castleberry hisself's down at the gin, along with 20 deputies -- guns, badges, everything. - Shouldn’t we call it off, Hank? - We -- We tried to warn you. We borrowed Jules' phone, called Amityville. Uh-huh. Well, look here. Here are the weights. Here are the weights. And I got an affidavit here that says they've been checked and is exactly correct. You mean you're going through with it? The reason you couldn't get me at Amityville -- I was over at Hamilton. I learned about the deputies there. Twenty men? Well, we got 50 men! You all good shots? Hank, what are you saying? Not shooting. No, no, my little Quaker. No. Pennsylvania Quaker, she was born. But if some of those deputies get in the way, they're liable to age awful fast. - This is insane. - All right, now. Come on. Let's not keep Mr. Castleberry and his deputies waiting. - You're the doctor, Hank. - Now, Swift, you and Jeb, you go on down to Castleberry's gin by the east road just like you always do, normal and usual. Hank -- Hank, you're not a -- a gangster. There's one charge against you now. Sweetface, if I'm right, this is a battle of life and death we're fighting. And, if I'm right, what we're doing is no more wrong than stealing the ache and sweat off a man year after year after year! Yes, Hank, but you may not be right. Hank! Hank! Hank, you must be plumb out of your mind. Get out of this county 'fore they jail you. We've done enough advertising. Maybe too much. Now, get your heads down and keep 'em down! Now, brighten up, Sweetface. Brighten up. 'Cause you married a winner! Not a loser! Okay, Mr. Brown. Guess it's time to get the bad news, eh, Jeb? Oh, you're not very talky today, Jeb. Last year, I remember plain. You and Jennie, you come down together, just the same as you have for the last 15 years, she with her best bonnet on. Just planning to spend your year's money. Just laughing and t-- Well, what do you know? For the first time in more than 15 years, you brought in more than a ton. Yes, sir. Two thousand, two hundred pounds. You must have been staying up nights with them cotton plants. Singing to 'em, maybe? I'll get your money. Couldn't have thought things would go this wrong. What do we do? He's over there somewhere. If you're lying to me, you know where I spend the next five or ten years of my life, don't you? It's the middle of the floorboard, Mr. Hank, just like we told you. We grow cotton, too, Mr. Hank, and we got to sell it to that gin. Yeah. I see your point. All right. Jeb, you being such an old customer, Mr. Beach hisself is here to give you your money. Mr. Beach is the general manager of all the Castleberry gins, everywheres. Well, it's just that we want you to know we value your patronage, Mr. Brown. Well, maybe you want to make us a present of your cotton, Mr. Brown. Something the matter with our money all of a sudden? You -- You better say it. There ain't nothing else you can do. Well, Mr. Rector, Mr. Beach, uh... l got me some weights of my own here. That right, now, Jeb? Weights of your own, huh? What for, Jebby boy? Hank Martin, he has an affidavit that they's right. I want you should let me check your weights. Well, now, that's an interesting thing. Don't you think, Mr. Beach, sir? Yeah. Yes, it is, Mr. Rector. And a little disturbing, too, that such a valued customer should have doubts. However... go on and check 'em, Brown! Check 'em, and send that troublemaking peddler to the chain gang, where he belongs! Now, go on and check 'em! I reckon there's been a mistake. Giddap. Here! Here! Back 'em up in here! We're all right interested in what Hank Martin's weights has to say. That's the spirit, gentlemen. That's the spirit! Step right up! Step right up, gentlemen, and join the weight-guessing contest. Gentleman here got just a mite greedy. Wants that heap of cotton to weigh more than 2,200 pounds. I'm a pretty busy man, sir. He means hurry it up, Jebby. Hurry it up. One thousand! Be funny if'n he lost by this, eh, boys? Two thousand! Two thousand, two hundred! Well, what do you know? No cigar for the gentleman. Two thousand, two hundred. Seems to be right, Mr. Brown. And we got 20 deputies here as witnesses. Looks like your friend Hank Martin's going on a long, long trip. That so, Mr. Beach, sir? Well, this has all been very illuminating. Very nice gathering you got here too. Nice to be in such pleasant company. Such pleasant company! Lewis, serve your warrant. Hank Martin, I got you a warrant for your arrest. Charge of criminal libel. Well, uh, what are you so nervous about, Lewis? I warn you, Martin, that these men are peace officers, properly deputized according to law. Never did get a chance to read a warrant writ by a proper high-price lawyer such that the Castleberry Company got. Hmm. This, uh, this here lawyer of yours is a real honest-to-goodness blue blood, ain't he? Well, his blood is so blue his brain ain't getting no sustenance. This here so-called alleged warrant ain't no warrant at all. It was issued in Hamilton, county seat of another county! Are you so dumb, Lewis, you don't know that our county seat is Randolph? Me? I-I suppose it was issued in Randolph. Shut up. Now the peddler's a lawyer. You know, you fellas been making the law bend, bow, lean, and scrape so long your way that you can't understand it working for anybody else. All you fellas been deputized to the wrong county! Throw this man off Castleberry property! You heard Mr. Beach. Throw him off! You know the penalty for interfering with peace officers. Where they going?! Into the office. Any objections? Anyone crossing that threshold will be arrested for illegal entry. Arrest for illegal entry by a lot of illegal deputies. Sure is heap of illegals. Now, look, men. I got 50 men to your 20. And they're my men, and it's their sweat and their work that they're trying to save here. Now, what are you gonna take a chance of getting shot for? The day's pay you're gonna get anyway? Or maybe the love Castleberry and Beach bear for you? Ha! Right pretty weights. Right pretty weights. Not a scuff mark or a fleck of dust on any of 'em. You know, there's one thing I hate worse than a thief. And that's a bad thief. Well, now, that's more like -- more like the weights we've been cheated by year in and year out. Now, how about a little side bet it don't go to 2,200 pounds this time? No side bet. All right, Jeb. Five hundred. One thousand. Fifteen hundred. No, Jeb, not another 500. Try a 100. Yeah. I say it goes to 1,600 pounds. Sixteen hundred pounds! Sixteen hundred! Six hundred pounds short! Now, how about your criminal libel suit now, Mr. Castleberry? It's some kind of a trick. Some kind of -- Some kind of a trick, he says! You got no proof these weights have ever been used. - Hank, is everyth-- - We won! We proved it! And I'm apologizing. Apologizing for not having done this years ago! Hank, just to tell you for all of us, we're mighty grateful. Mighty humbled. Well, my little Quaker... Oh, Hank -- Oh, Hank! I know Robert Castleberry is honest. And I'd say the same thing about Hank Martin. Oh, I'll never doubt you again. Like Jeb, I'm plumb humble. Well, I'll -- Jules -- Oh, Swift! Gather up those false weights of theirs. We might as well have evidence on our side for a change. Put them weights down. Drop them weights! I'm gonna shoot! Y'all best leave, Mr. Castleberry. - There might be more shooting. - Go ahead, please. That's right, Castleberry! Run! Leave your wounded lying on the ground and run! You know that bird we got up in the swamps, the black skimmer? Always wears black? Well, he lives by skimming over the water and scooping up all the little bugs and fishes without even slowing down. Well, every time -- every time I see that black skimmer scooping and swallowing, scooping and swallowing, I want to take him by the neck and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze until he spews up every little thing that he et! And we've only begun our squeezing. Now we've only begun to squeeze! Only begun! - That Deputy Lewis, he's dying. - We've got to get a doctor. - Well, go and get him. - Hank, he's really bad. It's awful hard to kill a pool hall shark like that. Now let's see you avoid the chain gang. Inciting to violence, Martin. Inciting to violence. Or maybe murder. Oh, come on, Sweetface. Leave him be. Leave him be till the doctor gets here. Leave him there to die? Is that what you want on your name? Murder? Is that what you want to pass on to our baby? Our baby? Yes. Yes, our baby. Isn't this a fine time to tell you? Fine, fine time! Listen, everybody! I'm going to have a baby! A baby! Ha! This is purely my lucky day! Ya-ha! - Hello? - I want to see the man. Mr. Castleberry is not in. He only sees people by appointment. - If you'd write a letter... - I writ him letters. I writ him a letter signed by 300 names. I told you he's not in. Black skimmer! I am not in the custom of lying. What kind of man is he? What kind of world is it where they can hold a man for murder for shooting down a mad dog? Where they can deny bail and habeas corpus? Look here. You tell the man Hank Martin was here. And you tell him there's no place he can go where he can hide from Hank Martin. Oh, sir, I'm sorry. We tried to phone you to cancel your appointment. Mr. Castleberry was called up to Randolph. He had an appointment with me for 3:00, which he chose not to keep, huh? I'm the man you want to see. Who are you? I'm the one who can get Jeb Brown's trial scheduled. You don't know me. You're the famous one. I've even been thinking of driving upcountry to see you. Walking my way? If what happened that day at the gin regarding the weights should get into the papers, it would ruin Castleberry's business. Right now, every paper in the state is afraid to mention it. But if testimony about the weights should come out in a court of law, any and every paper could print it without fear of suit. They think they can legally keep Jeb Brown's trial from being scheduled. They're so cocksure, they've been turning down my offers to buy them out. Good offers. I might like to try and teach them a lesson. Hello there, Guy boy. Long time no see. Call me up sometime. "Guy," he called you. Is that a name? If I hadn't swung him a big piece of the Dodge City vote, maybe he wouldn't have got elected. And he didn't even bother to call me up and say thank you. I'm a great one for the little social things, like "thank you" and "please." Well, a minute ago, you said you'd be able to get Jeb Brown's trial scheduled. I'd like that. I know a judge up in your county. I know him pretty good. I hear you got political ambitions. Is, uh, is that where the thank-you comes in? No. It's just that you might serve my purpose is all. Like maybe help to get Snowden and his do-good boys out of power. Then, too, if this case comes to trial, you'll be a pretty big man with... a lot of cotton growers and farmers. I like pretty big men to owe me. Owe you what? A thank-you. At this time of year, I'm at the Dodge City Hotel. Day and night. The name is Guy Polli. Where to? 2108 Magnolia. I saw you talking to Guy Polli. You know Guy Polli? Yeah. He gave me 50 bucks once. - What? - Yeah. Ethel used to go out to his place all the time and touch up his hair where it gets gray. Once, when she was sick, I went in her place, and he gave me 50 bucks. - Just like that? - Yeah. Never tried nothing? Never asked for nothing in the way of a thank-you? Well, sure. I swear. Well. Last time I talked to a gambler, he took me for seven bucks and a brand-new pair of nail clippers. Driver... take me to the Dodge City Hotel. Might as well have a talk with Mr. Guy Polli, long as he wants so little in the way of a thank-you. Jeb. Sleeping just like a one-year-old, huh? Hey, did you ever figure that you might lose this trial and leave here hanging at the end of a rope? They'll all be coming down for the show. Everybody in Cypress Bend. And I'm the big man. Mm. Well, maybe so. Oh, I cooked you some corn pone, but it -- it all burned up. Getting yourself all prettied up, are you, Jeb? Yep. And I want to thank you for all that good attention you've been giving me. Oh, that's all right. Give 'em a couple of backfires. - Get 'em used to it. - Yes, sir. I'll blow the rear end off this crate if you say so. Help! Somebody please... help! What is it? What's the answer? Well, Hank, like I told you before, I've been coroner so many years, I see 'em dead soon as I take a look at 'em, but -- Well, somewheres, maybe, is a doctor could give that man a new esophagus, rebuild all the glands and what all is in the neck. But I never seen such a doctor, and I sure enough ain't one. - There's internal bleeding -- - Will he live? No. I'm gonna fix to give him this here hypodermic, kill the pain. Sometime in the next few hours, he'll probably pass away in his sleep. Quiet and easy as you please, probably. I'll get other doctors. I'll -- I'll sell my wagon. Oh, if it wasn't for me fixin' and fussin' -and pushin' and arrangin' -- -Hank, it wasn't your fault. Hank, darling, don't blame yourself. ♪ Work, for the night is coming ♪ ♪ Work through the sunny noon ♪ ♪ Fill the brightest hours with labor ♪ ♪ Rest comes sure and soon ♪ ♪ Give every flying minute ♪ ♪ Something to keep in store ♪ ♪ Work, for the night is coming ♪ Quiet! Quiet down there! They shot him! What's that you're saying? Jeb Brown is in there shot and fighting for his life! I swear to you -- I swear to you, the black skimmer ain't gonna get away with this! I swear to you! Now all you can do is pray. Down on your knees! And pray! Pray for Jeb Brown! Yeah, Jeb. He's trying to say something. The trial. Jeb, we'll postpone till you're better. Die. No, honey. You ain't gonna die. - Die. - No, Jeb. No, no. You're fine. You're gonna be as good as... You're dying, boy. But nobody's got a right to steal a man's last hour. Nobody's got the right. Maybe God. We'll get a minister. It wasn't a murder. Tell little Lucy it weren't no murder. It wasn't no murder. Jeb. This here stuff he'll give you will stop the pain. And chances are, you'll never wake up. You'll be warm and happy and peaceful, and you'll never wake up. You got a right to that, Jeb. You got a right to it. It's up to you. But how about it? Do you want to hold that trial? - Do you want to clear your name? - Hank, are you out of your mind? There isn't a judge in the country would consider such a thing. This judge is a friend of a friend. I agreed to act as counsel in this case to help Jeb Brown, not you, Hank. I have no interest in helping you to use this poor man to get statewide publicity. Jules, that's not true. You got a dirty little mind, Bolduc. Now, it's up to you, boy. Hard or easy? Do you want to sleep your life away or do you want to give it away, use it away? Do you want to go ahead with the trial? Do you want to clear your name? Hank, you got no right. Hank's got the right, Verity. They's men... and they's friends. Blood friends. They understand each other. And there ain't no publicity stuff in it. They's men who knows how to hate a murderer like Castleberry. Your Honor, the defendant is determined to go on. Your Honor, it's one thing for the defendant to be determined, but I believe -- In all humanity, sir, let us have no further delays. The trial will proceed. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to forget for a moment this poor, sick man sitting over here and to think of another man. An man named Wilbur Lewis, who is dead. Because of Jeb Brown! Jeb! Jeb! Your Honor, I refuse to prosecute an unconscious man. Your Honor, I think we should postpone. No! No! He's all right! He wants to go on! Jeb, in the name of heaven. Jules. Jules... We aim to prove that Jeb Brown, a man who ordinarily never carried a gun, did, on this day, early in the morning, arm himself for a shooting that took place near noon. Now, we aim to prove premeditation. - First witness. - Mr. Frank Rector. Jeb! Oh, Jeb! Jeb. - Jeb, are you all right? - Yeah, he's all right. Jules, you got to cross-examine Rector, and do it now! Hank, he tried so hard. He tried so hard to stay alive long enough. You got to clear his name. He's all right! He's all right! Leave him be! Jules -- Jules, come on. Cross-examine. Get it on the record. -Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I just got to. We can't yet, Hank. The prosecution is still... When Jeb Brown shot Lewis, was Lewis pointing a gun at anybody else? Mr. Martin, sir, what is the meaning of this? Your Honor... this man is dead. Was Lewis pointing a gun at anybody else when Jeb Brown shot him?! Answer yes or no! Mr. Martin, I will hold you in contempt. All right! Then I'll say it! I was there! And I'm a right better witness than this bought-and-paid-for Castleberry man! Yes! I say yes! Lewis was pointing a gun at somebody else! If Jeb hadn't fired, Swift there would be dead instead of Lewis! Jeb Brown never did no murder! Now, say it! Was Jeb Brown guilty of murder? Say it for his wife there, for his little daughter, for Jeb, who tried so hard. Everybody in town knows what happened that day! Everybody knows! Say it! Innocent! Wait! No! Wait! Nobody go! We're not through yet! We're not through yet! - We're not through! - Bailiff! Bailiff! Martin, what are you trying to do to a court of law? Stop it! Stop this farce! You know, and I know, and everybody knows what happened at the gin that day! Hank, you can't try a dead man! Try? We already tried Jeb and proved him innocent! That trial's over. Now we're trying Robert L. Castleberry IV, the real murderer! Bailiff, take Mr. Martin into custody. Hank, this is mob rule! Look, everybody knows what caused the trouble at the gin that day! I proved -- I proved that Castleberry's weights was weighing false! Now, there are you, reporters! What are you waiting for? This is no trial! Now, remember that! This is no trial! This court is adjourned. Only now he's adjourning! We got it! We got it in! Jeb done it, Jennie. Jeb done it. You should be righteous proud he done it. I am proud, Hank. I'm righteous proud. Oh, Hank. He never succeeding in nothing before. For his whole life. But he done this. He done this. Jeb done it! Jeb done it! He done it for you and for me and for all of us! Now everybody -- everybody everywhere will know the truth! Make way for the press! They carry your message, our message, the message that Jeb died for, to get to the people. Let 'em out! And I swear to you -- I swear to you we'll find the man who killed Jeb Brown and hang him! Hang him higher than Haman! Jeb Brown, who's gone to be a soldier in the army of the Lord! ♪ Gone to be a soldier in the army of the Lord ♪ ♪ He's gone to be a soldier in the army of the Lord ♪ ♪ He's gone to be a soldier in the army of the Lord ♪ ♪ His soul goes marching on ♪ ♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♪ ♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♪ ♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♪ ♪ His soul goes marching on ♪ ♪ Jeb Brown died as the slaves might be free ♪ ♪ Jeb Brown died as the slaves might be free ♪ ♪ Jeb Brown died as the slaves might be free ♪ ♪ But his soul goes marching on ♪ Let's not misunderstand each other, Mr. Polli. If you buy Castleberry and Company, you buy our plants, our employees, our stock of unginned cotton, and our ill will. One thing and one thing only I retain. My right to examine all records and accounts, to find out by any way I can what, if any, basis there is for these charges of short-weighting. I have already employed -- and I've mortgaged my home to do it -- a firm of private detectives to carry on this investigation. Should I discover that any trusted employee or employees of mine has systematically been fleecing the company as well as thousands of many small cotton growers, I retain my right to prosecute such ex-employees to the fullest extent of the law. You may have your attorneys prepare a draft of the sales agreement. I'm sort of way ahead of you, Mr. Castleberry. I suspect you have been for quite some time, Mr. Polli. Hank! Hank! We want Hank! Hank! Hank! We want Hank! We want Hank! Hank! Hank! We want Hank! We want Hank! Hank! Vote against... your going on being poor! Vote against Castleberry! And all the other -- all the other black Skimmers! Vote for me! And a fine man, the honorable Governor Snowden. I can't offer shortcuts or cure-ails. I have no patent medicine that will make hair grow, cure pneumonia, and be good for crops. That's right. And Mr. Martin doesn't have it either. And for the same reason. It does not exist. ...the end of us upcountry people to being poor and hungry. Well, the only question I got, Mr. Martin, is how are you gonna end it just like that? You got some way of getting manna from heaven? Well, let's put it this way, Mr. Pritchard. You know my motto, "You name it, I got it"? Well, where -- where would you like to have your manna delivered? Tomorrow is the day! Vote for me -- me, tomorrow! It'll be quite a storm. Come on, come on, come on! Say, Central? Central, I -- Borrowing your phone, Jules. - Is the line still open? - I can hear humming. Take care you don't get yourself electricked. Hello? Hello? Hello! I got to say, this don't feel like no little local storm. Just exactly what does a little local storm feel like? Hello? Hello, Central? Oh, Central, about that call to the weather bureau. Is it -- Oh. Uh, well, okay. Is it gonna rain everywhere? Is it -- What? Yeah, yeah. A general forecast. Hank. Hank, darling, you would have won. I know it. 'Twas the night before election, and all through the house... Hm. General rain, beginning before dawn, statewide. Rain! The one thing I couldn't do anything about! Rain on Election Day! Pleased as punch, ain't you? People that live close to a town, some of them will be able to vote. And my opponent, the citified Governor Snowden, thousands of his voters will ride to the polls in nice, dry streetcars. No blackjack mud for them. Hank? Hank, everything's all right, huh? A little storm. A big storm? - Oh. - Jennie, Jennie. Jennie, when you got fear, fill your chest with air, like to bust. I got 12 hours before the polls open. Jules, would you lend me your car? Even if you're agin me, would you lend me your car? What have you got in mind this time, Hank? I'm going to go into the city and get the city vote. Nice, dry, streetcar-riding votes. Jennie, everything's gonna be all right. I swear to you, on Jeb's memory, everything's gonna be all right. I know they are. It had to be. - The car's in the garage, Hank. - Thanks, Jules. Verity, wish me luck. Sit down. Hank, how? Jules, I ain't minded you not being for me, but I have minded you always implying that besides being wrong, I'm dishonest. Perhaps it's because you've never answered my questions. Such as the old one about the last time you went to the city and how you suddenly got Jeb Brown's trial scheduled -- and before that particular judge. Jules, he saw someone in the attorney general's office. A friend of a friend of his. He told us. Did he, Verity? Any reason to believe I'm lying? No, none. Just common sense. Well, sometimes a man ain't got time for common sense. Jules, one day you'll see. You'll see what a great man Hank Martin is. He'll need this. All right. Let him come in. The gatekeeper calling to say that a certain Mr. Hank Martin wants to see me. Well, I guess I'd better be going. I hadn't ought to be seen here. Oh, we don't hide from friends, Mr. Beach. By now, Mr. Hank Martin is almost on our team. Oh, it's just that he's got all them funny ideas about helping the people. The "folkses," he calls 'em. He had, you mean. The only idea he's got now, if I know my man, is getting to be governor. That must be our little boy now. Good evening, sir. Ah. - Good evening, Miss Flamingo. - Good evening. He sure knows your name awful good for somebody who'd been here only once. Well, somebody gave me a name that's easy to remember. - I'll wait here for you. - Oh, no. No, no, you don't. You come on in with me. Do as you're told. What can I offer him? What can I possibly offer a man that has all this? Hi, Martin. I, uh... ...I guess maybe you heard. Polli bought out Castleberry and Company. So now I work for Mr. Polli. See you around. Wheels within wheels within wheels. I stalled your friend Beach so as you'd be sure to meet. I want you and him to get friendly. What are you talking about? Paper says statewide rain, light country vote. That's why you're here, ain't it? You'll just have to wait till I'm through feeding my little beauties. Well what does Samuel T. Beach got to do with anything? Just another chump who bit off more than he can swallow. Even my fish are smarter than that. They fatten off the little ones like these. Well, I ain't got no time for no fish conversation. - Why do you want to be governor? - Because I got to be! The little fish, they like to live, but mostly they die. Well, I ain't gonna die. Not without a fight. So you want some of that nice, dry Dodge City vote, huh? Yeah. Please. I make it a rule never to ask a man to do nothing that ain't good for him too. It's to your interest as much or more than mine. We got to back up Beach. The slob's in bad trouble. If it comes to trial, the whole thing will be out, and all your fancy talk about the black skimmer will look pretty silly. What are you talking about? You can't have got this far and be dumb. You must have figured out it was Beach doing the stealing, not Castleberry. Beach and most of the other gin managers. - Hank, what -- - Well, I ain't giving up now! Almost in, and I ain't giving up now. Of course you're not, Hank. Well, maybe -- maybe I did pull a boner, but I'll make it up somehow, some way to Castleberry. He ain't waiting for you. He's been busy as a little beaver. He's had private detectives working with the sheriff. They found all the bank accounts Beach has got under different names. Also, they found some ex-con who swears he saw Rector driving the backfiring car the morning Jeb was murdered. You hearing me? I don't want no public trial for Beach, 'cause I'm gonna start putting Castleberry and Company on a good dollars-and-cents basis for a change. I ain't interested in no more people knocking it. Beach don't want the trial 'cause it'll hang him. You don't want the trial because it'll be the end of you as a politician. Hearing me, Martin? My lawyers ain't a million miles away right now. They're waiting to draw up a deposition that you was with Beach at the time of the shooting. There'll be no true bill. No indictment. Nothing will ever come out. No publicity. And then, I'll try my best to get you the Dodge City vote. The precincts that I control. Maybe it'll put you in, maybe it won't. You can't tell about votes till you count 'em. But I'll try. Just one other little deal. The rest you can fix up and improve as much as you want. Those roads you've been promising everybody. - What about the roads? - Build all you want. Except in certain counties where I got cotton gins. I'll give you a list. I don't want people free to shop around too much. Hank Martin's rain, huh? Hank, what's the matter? He said he'd do it. He said he'd help you. Give Jeb Brown's murderer an alibi? What'll I do if they find me out? What do you care? You'll be Governor Hank Martin. Then we can be together all the time. Yeah. I'll be governor. I'll be governor. Poll, your mother ever warn you -- ever warn you about making a house pet of a wildcat? Don't think she ever mentioned it. Well, you might get bit. All right, city boy. Bring on your lawyers. Bring 'em on. You got Castleberry's now, and you want Beach to stay out of jail. Well, city boy, you got a deal. Come on. Show me the color. Show me the color of your affidavit! Come on! Come on! Come on! What's the matter, city boy? You afraid of a little rain? Come on! We ain't got all night! Come on! It looks like it's Governor Snowden all the way. Not that the sharecroppers' candidate, Mr. Hank Martin of Cypress Bend, isn't making an impressive showing. He is. He's shown this state one thing, Mr. Hank Martin has, and that is that an independent... Of course, there's no way of telling what's going to happen four years from now and whether Mr. Martin would choose to or even be in a position to run again. But certainly some politician or new political party is going to take advantage -- Yes, even if he's defeated, this ex-peddler, who has spent his life up to now going from cabin to cabin and village to village selling toothpaste and lanterns and pots and pans -- Folks, it's Hank! Well... cheer up, folkses. The say we made what is called... a good showing. Hank. Hank. Oh, Hank. Hank, you got a baby. Hank, we ain't all the way lost yet. The election's a dead heat. - What? - You and Snowden. You got the same number of counties, and you got two Dodge City precincts. And she's all right, Hank. She done just fine, Verity did. A baby? A baby? - A baby! - Dr. Stevens has been with her. He'll be back before -- Sweetface. Sweetface. Oh, and to think... to think I wasn't here. Oh. I thought maybe we'd call her Nancy, Hank. It was my grandmother's name. Nancy? Well, Hank Jr. just won't fit now. Hm. Nancy. Nancy. Hey, what was this Swift was saying about -- about we're not losing? We have almost as many votes as Governor Snowden, and in exactly the same counties. It's up to the state assembly to decide now. But, Hank, the radio man said that with the assembly being mostly Snowden men... Uh-huh. Yeah. Hank... you got a lot of city votes. Thousands of them. How'd you do it? Oh. Hancy! "Hancy," with a capital "Hancy," with a capital H! - Hancy! - Oh. Oh, that's terrible. Folkses! Mr. Martin, we're all set to go on the air, and we thought if you had a moment you might be able to -- Folkses! I got me a daughter! A brand-new daughter, and her name is Hancy, spelled with a capital "H"! Mr. Martin, sir? Mr. Martin, we got a statewide hookup and we sort of thought if you were going to concede, you might make a statement. We gave you good coverage during the campaign. Get ready to switch me into the program circuit. - Next time, Hank. - One, two three... Everybody says next time you'll make it sure. Five, four, three, two, one. Jeb would be proud we got this far, Hank. He'd understand. Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to hear a statement by Mr. Hank Martin himself. Mr. Martin? We'd have won if we had the roads. We'd have won, hands down, beat him fair and square, without any sign of a doubt. Well, maybe four years from now, we'll win. Lessin' something goes wrong again. Lessin' it rains again. But, uh, it has a funny way of raining this time of the year. Four years. A little louder, Mr. Martin. Four long years. And how many of our kids will have grown past school age without learning to read and write, excepting maybe "cat" and "rat"? And how many suppers of potatoes and turnip tops will you have all et? And how many acres of mud that they call roads will you have trudged through? Oh, yes, folks, I've been thinking about you tonight. Just as I've been thinking about you all through the campaign. Oh, sure, sure, I've been thinking of me too. And my wife, Verity, and now my new little daughter, Hancy, spelled with a capital "H." I got to admit, I've been thinking of us Martins too. I've been thinking about that handsome governor's mansion. The state-paid-for limousine with the state-paid-for driver transporting me and my little family around. - Oh, yes. - Poor Hank. I've been thinking about... I'd follow him to kingdom come. ...so much that I can almost taste it. Well, folkses... if I were to tell you that I didn't want to be governor, I'd be lying. Now they tell me the vote's tied. And now it's in the hands of the assembly. Well, this here assembly is supposed to represent all the people. All the people. But just the same, when they meet in January, they're going to raise their hands for Snowden. They'll raise their little hands for Snowden, although the will of the people -- the will of the people seems clear. Now, it don't take no college professor to know what the will of the people is, barring a little rain. All right, now. We tried to express our will. We tried to express it legal-like -- polls, ballot boxes, and pretty speeches to each other. We tried it legal, and it didn't work. We got to ask ourselves if there ain't some other way. Well, I say it's up to them, not us, to wait till next election. They expect us to concede. They expect us to act like it was, oh, just a polite little tennis game we've been playing. How about that? Well, I meant it, and it still goes! We ain't conceding! Miss Verity, what are you doing out here in your condition? Jules Bolduc. Take me to Jules. ...too blamed mad to concede! Snowden's gonna concede! Snowden! Not us! It stopped raining, and we're gonna show Snowden the size of us. Let him count the noses of us in person. Now heat up and get rolling! We're gonna march on, move on, descend on Dodge City! And bring your guns along just in case! All right, now. Heat up and get rolling. This is where we're gonna assemble. This is gonna be our jumping-off place, and I'm waiting on you in front of my house in Cypress Bend... Hold on a minute, everybody! Hank must not have figured this out all out proper-like. Why, how does he know that he would have won if it hadn't rained? The count might have been worse against him. Aw, let's go! Ladies and gentlemen, this whole town is on the move. You just heard Mr. Hank Martin speaking to you from his home right here in Cypress Bend. We don't know what's going to happen, but it looks like it's gonna be a riot, because he's calling for guns, and I see some guns in the crowd. - Mr. Peck and Mrs. Martin. - Mr. Bolduc, Moses. Moses, where's Mr. Bolduc? Does he know what's going on out there? He left in a hurry. They come after him in the middle of his supper. And the sheriff from Randolph come with his siren on. Ma'am, what is it? - A lynching? - Oh, no, Moses. Certainly not that kind. This is -- This is a lynching of a whole state. A whole sovereign state. This is a lynching led by my husband. And people are gathering here in his front yard from everywhere. They're coming with weapons in their hands. From where I stand, I can see shotguns... Remember Governor Snowden's orders. There's not to be a gun drawn or a shot fired regardless. Well, folkses, it's about that time. And now... let us ask the aid of the Almighty. We, the needy... the oppressed, the enfeebled... ...we, the meek of the earth and our kinfolk ask Thy aid in this here undertaking. Amen Amen And now -- now let's get rolling! ♪ Jeb Brown died that us slaves might be free ♪ ♪ Jeb Brown died that us slaves might be free ♪ ♪ Jeb Brown died that us slaves might be free ♪ ♪ But his soul goes marching on ♪ ♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♪ ♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♪ ♪ Glory... ♪ -Stand aside! We're heading for glory! Jeb Brown died, all right! Jeb Brown died for nothing! Come on! Get rolling! Jeb was sold out -- sold down the river! - And so were you! - Jules Bolduc, what you saying? - What you saying? - Jennie. Jennie, they found the gun that killed your Jeb. And they found a witness to the shooting -- an accomplice. And they found the murderer. They got him cold. Who was it? They arrested Samuel T. Beach this morning and released him this evening. Jeb's murderer walks free because of a signed statement -- a sworn statement. And here it is! A sworn statement! The man who signed this swore he was with Samuel T. Beach at the time the murder took place! This crooked statement was signed and sworn to by Hank Martin! Cease your lying, Jules Bolduc. Cease your lying! I was with Samuel Beach! Like I swore. I was in a hotel room at the Randolph with him begging him to testify for us instead of agin us at Jeb's trial. You think I don't want to see Jeb's killer punished? He was my friend! My friend! I'd just as soon hang Samuel Beach on general principles. But not to cover up for a crime committed by the black skimmer, Jules Bolduc's precious godfather, Robert Castleberry. That's not true! It was Beach that was cheating you! Beach and Rector cheating you and Castleberry! We have the evidence. There is no black skimmer. There never was! Hank Martin has used that lie for his own ends! Jennie, don't! He's been lying agin Hank from the beginning. No, Jennie, don't. Hank wasn't with Beach. He was with me. The affidavit is false. Now, Jennie. Jennie, girl, listen. All right, now. All right, folks. Listen. Let's be grown up about this. Hanging Beach is not gonna bring Jeb Brown back. And I had to face facts -- hard, hard political facts. All right. I did sign the affidavit. You sold out. You! Look, little Jennie bird. Don't you think it hurt me too? Do you think I wanted to? You sold out! No! Hank! Hank! Hank! Hank! You told on me, Sweetface. You told on me. I didn't mean it, Hank. I didn't mean it. It's all right. It's all right. There's still time. It's all right. It's all right. Hank Let me be. Now... come on. I told you... told you I'd lead you to glory. Well, listen. There-- There's still time. There's still time! Come on! Come follow me! I'll lead you! Lead you to glory. Come on. Hank! Hank! Hank, lie still. You'll only make it worse, Hank. Lie still. You're the state's First Lady, Sweetface. - Yes. - You and Hancy, right? We're the whole state's first family. Yes, Hank. You're gonna be all right. All right, I tell you, Hank. - You told on me, Sweetface. - Oh, no. I was kicking 'em all in the right places, and... everybody was dancing to my tune. And all of a sudden... ...they found me out. Never knewed folks who could be so... awful and small. Hank! He's dead! He's dead! Hank.
