Carmela! Teresa. Carmela. Teresa. Carmela. Teresa. Carmela. Vamos! Rapido! Kill me. Fire, you son of a bitch. Carmela. Fidel Castro is emptying his jails of political prisoners and allowing them to flee Cuba. President Carter has granted asylum to all the 110.000 Cuban refugees that have reached American shores. The last boats departing from area harbor near Havana are heading towards Key West in a steady flow. He isn't coming tonight, Mama. Teresa. Remember 20 years ago? I was three. U.S. Immigration officials say the refugees represent a wide cross section of Cuban society. At a May Day rally, Fidel Castro urged one million cheering supporters to denounce the marielitos... I wonder which side of the bed he'll sleep on. I am waiting two months. When I can go on the boatlift? Bonita... You don't want to go. You have a good job cutting sugar cane. You are a whore, no? You like it, eh? I am like Cuba, used by many, conquered by no one. A man like you change uniform with each regime... Batista, Fidel. But I am siempre la isla. What do you want in America that I can't give you here? I love Elvis Presley. I dig rock 'n' roll. I want to fuck John Wayne. Oye. When we get to Miami I will have a gold compact with little shells on top. We go to United States. Ooh! Marielita soy, soy. Hold my money. I'm dreaming. Florida. Florida. I thought we were back in Mariel. No, senor. Look. Key West. Will my wife be here to meet me? How nice. You have a wife. That's good. I didn't know I'd be so old, senora. My teeth are too poor to kiss my wife. No worry. You can kiss your wife. Carry my things, senor. No! No! Play Nothin' But a Hound Dog. Chico. ♪ Nothin' but a hound dog ♪ Nothin' but a hound dog One bag, please. Only one bag, please. Courtesy of the American Red Cross. Scum. One bag, please. Hey! Hey! One bag! Your name? Juan Raul Perez. Political prisoner. Your charge? I set my sugar cane fields on fire. Instead of giving them to him, to Fidel. Marital status? Married? Si. Your name? Put down Dottie. Dorita Evita Perez. I don't like Dorita. I hate Evita. Little Dora, little Eva. It's not a matter of like or dislike. I am a new woman here. You came here for political asylum. You can change your name some other time, okay? I don't want no political asylum. I came here to get away from political asylum. I don't want no government. Do you have any other relatives here? I mean, other than your wife? Yes. Perez. If you want something done in this life, ask a Perez. There are so many of us. My mother was a Perez. They didn't ask me anything about Carmela. He didn't ask me nothing. America! Very lucky that you're married. Sponsors here don't want to take spinsters or bachelors, especially single ladies. A sponsor? We are getting a criminal element from your Cuba. Prostitutes, riffraff. Easy disease. Now, they're undesirable. Now for sponsors, large families at the top of the list. Single people stuck in camps waiting, waiting, simply waiting. Ay, Dios mio. Is it over? The coast lift? Yep. Thank God. This morning anyone named Perez? Everyone named Perez. Ah. I'm looking for Juan Perez. Try 110.000 marielitos in two months, my friend. Half of them named Juan Perez. Only one today. Juan Perez. Excuse me? And his wife Dorita Perez. Wife? No, no. I'm looking for, uh... I'll give you $20 to stop making that noise! It's free. I'm looking for the Juan Perez that's married to my sister Carmela in Miami. You positive this Juan Perez has a wife? Mami! I hire six boats to go over to Mariel. You know how much it cost me? And for what? Human garbage. You're working for Fidel, my friend. Are you French? No. Carmela, the radio. I heard they closed the boatlift. Did he come? He's coming today. I feel it. You know how you get those feelings? I hope this is working. Angel went to Key West. He's supposed to call when he's back with Juan Raul. That's okay. I'm just excited. Angel. Carmela. I'm so sorry. The last boat arrived and Juan Raul did not come. Carmela? I'm sorry. I kept sending them bribes to get him out of jail. No. Don't cry, Carmelina. Oh, no. I'll take care of you. Angel, no. No. Juan? Do you really have a wife in Miami? When was the last time you hear from her? Two years ago. I have a letter. Nothing in two years? No money, no nothing? Ooh, your wife could be dead, senor. She could be in a terrible accident or married to somebody else. She could be the wife of a rich man. She could be living in Venezuela. Are you sure your wife is waiting for you? Because I have a solution. Oye. If your wife does not come, you and I can pretend to be married. Perez y Perez. Just for the richest sponsor. When we're free, I help you to find your wife. I don't need your help, senora. Carmela will come for me. Good! Then you can take me into your house to pay me for my kindness. Just until I find a job. Don't worry. I take very good care of you. I explain your wife I have no interest in you. It is strictly survival. Hollywood. That where John Wayne live. Only 65 mile to John Wayne. Oh, I go there tomorrow. Welcome to the Orange Bowl Football Stadium. You are permitted to leave the premises between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. After 9:00 p.m., is curfew. But remember, when you go out, you are on your own. If you do not return, you will be deemed illegal. So be careful. Obey the rules of the United States Immigration Service. Welcome to freedom. My God! They're going to shoot us! These men are not los policias, solamente security guarde They are not going to fire. Senora, stay behind me. Juan, you are not in Cuba. The police will not touch. You must stop this. The American will think you crazy. I have to get another husband. They really ought to debrief these people. Senora, don't leave me. I won't leave you. Angel has completely lost his paranoid little mind. Show some respect to your uncle. He's just trying to protect us with this crime wave. This is the crime wave. Buying a gun with no serial numbers and then giving it to your own sister without a permit. Mama. Why don't you take the medicine? The doctor says it will make you feel a lot stronger. He's right. I feel a lot stronger. Put the coffee back on, Teresa, por favor. Hello, Angel. You didn't have the door locked? How many times have I told you about the Mariel criminals? Castro flushed his toilets on us! Forgot to flush one, Angel. Forgot to send my husband. Carmelina, as if I didn't try everything! I sent him bribes! "As if I haven't done everything!" "Spent every damn dime I had. And for what?" "He doesn't even thank me." When is the last time you even had a letter from him, huh? What do you expect, a Hallmark card? Get in the car. I'll take you to the hospital. Shut up! I'm your uncle! Carmela, where's the gun I gave you? You have to keep it where you can use it. I threw it in the garbage. - Are you crazy? - Stop it, Angel! What do you think you're doing? My mother does not need a gun! You don't have a man around to protect you. What happens when a marielito comes through that door? Oh, shit! Were we that loud? Hide the gun. I'll take care of this. No. In there. Hi. Got a complaint. Just want to make sure everything's okay. Oh, I'm so sorry. I realize too late the TV was too loud. Very loud. Looks like it busted a hole in your wall over there. Mmm-hmm. We're having some work done. It's been that way for weeks. Mind if we come in and look around just a little bit? It'll just take a minute. Carmela Perez? Yes, and this is my daughter Teresa Perez. She studies art history at FIU. Why do you wear a beeper, Miss Perez? We were waiting for my husband on the boatlift. My brother gave it to me in case I wasn't near a phone. Oh. That is actually the truth, and yes, I know. The boatlift is over. July '80. This prescription was filled today. Where are the Valium? I put them down the sink. She really did. If I'm in pain, I want to know it. That's my philosophy exactly. Forgive me, Mrs. Perez, but I don't want to leave here if you're in some kind of situation with a man. A man? There's no man here. There's no man here? No. Okay. My name is John Pirelli. I'm a federal agent. Officer Rhoades here is the cop. I'm just doing some research with the local force. If you're in any kind of trouble, I want you to give one of us a call. Yes, of course. But there was no trouble. Okay. Sorry to bother you. You're a really good liar! Wow! Maybe the most beautiful liar I ever met. Titi! What happened to you? Titi! Why are you always wet, Flavia? You're always in the shower. You could have come in. I was lonely. Ohh. Painkillers are worthless. Oh, baby! Titi! Ow! Oh, guess what? I have been asked to sing at the Varadero Festival. Yes! They asked me, Flavia, at the Varadero Festival. Dame un besito, titi. Why is it always so messy here? We could go to your place sometime. You know how much money I spent on that condo? I don't want to get it dirty. That's why I take the shower. You don't like things dirty. You like things a little dirty. Ow! - Testing, one, two... - Stop it please. I failed Carmela. The only thing my sister ever asked me for. You know, Angel, you used to be so much fun until you got obsessed. Okay. Go, go away. Go to your clean condo. I wish your brother-in-law had come, and then this whole thing would be over. It is over, titi. He didn't come, and he's never going to. I'm sorry. Juan Raul Perez no longer exists. Teresa, my daughter. Teresa, mi linda. I feel like I'm floating. 20 years ago, I lay alone in my bed each night. In the morning, my pillow would be wet with tears. Each day I put you in the most beautiful embroidered dresses just in case there was a day that he would come. The waiting is familiar now. It's become a friend. It's like breathing. It's part of my life. He's never coming. I should be happy. I wanted Papi to come, too, Mama. When I was little, I wanted it more than anything. But also it's just good to know finally that he isn't coming. I was not a prostitute. If that's what you mean, the paper are a lie. It is saying, "Agricultural worker." 230 is your number. We get the sponsor today? 230 is your number. For the sponsor, large families are number one. Any children? No. No children. - Any in-laws? - No. No in-laws. I am going to have to tell you what to do. Get a job. 'Cause if you get a job, you get a sponsor. You are liking movies? Tonight, Cowboys and Indians. Hey, psst, not my kind of Indian. Ah, John Wayne! Do you know I'm going to meet him? He live very near. John Wayne is dead. No. You are wrong. You are thinking Elvis Presley. Elvis is dead, yes, but not John Wayne. No. Big Joe, it's me. Isn't your John Wayne dead? Not John Wayne. John Wayne is dead. He's dead. John Wayne is dead. At first I thought... Well, I knew Elvis was dead. Elvis Presley's dead? So many assassinations. They told me I have to find a job, and there are only two things I know how to do. One is cut sugar cane, and I cannot see any sugar cane on this football... The other thing, I was saving it for John Wayne. This is libertad. This prison! When I will be free? Juan, you really have a wife? Carmela. Carmela is my wife. Why did she not come for you? Senora, she doesn't know I'm here. I didn't tell her I was coming. I sent her away for the weekend, and it turned into 20 years. Okay. We are going to Immigration, and we are asking them to find her. Corre, senor. This is our only chance. Don't forget to tell them maybe she don't live here no more. And don't tell them she's your wife. Say she's your sister or your cousin. Don't put it up like that. It looks nice. I look like one of my workers in the sugar cane fields. What's wrong with that? My teeth. To come to Carmela like this. Juan, you're very handsome. You don't know what I was. Juan, believe me, if your wife loves you, she won't mind, but don't hope too much. Probably they don't even find her. Lip gloss, Rolex watches, aqui! Ooh, mama. Come over here. I like the way you walk. Hey, Perez. That's my customer. You Perez? Me, too. Dottie Perez. Felipe. Glad to know you. You from Mariel? - Yeah. - Oye, mijo. My husband and I can use another Perez. The bigger the family, the quicker we get the job. Thanks, mama, but I did the sponsor, you know? I'm finished with that. I'm out. Besides, I'm a lobo. The wolf. I'm better alone. You smart to have your own business, mijo. How much for the nail polish? 50 cents, and no family discounts, mama. Did I ask you for a discount? Hey, Perez, where's my money? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. What's a day? He or she? Something to eat, man. Aw, come on. Son cosas, ve? Save me, San Ignacio. Lip gloss, nail polish, right here. Hey, baby, I missed you. Felipe, my pal. Where have you been, Mr. Invisible? Hey, Orlando, I been trying to find you. I'm getting the money together. You know, man. I been trying. Really trying. I'll tell you what, you little fucking faggot. I'm gonna give you 24 hours. Oh, no. See, it's like, I need more time. Please, man. You're out of time. Manana. Shit! Aw, come on, man. Don't kill me. Yay, Pepito. Yay, Pepito. Yay, Pepito. Pepito. Aqui esta El dinero. Ah, gracias. - My wife has come? - Now, just follow me. I didn't know she would be here. I was standing, waiting in line. I didn't know. Ohh, look at this shirt. Yay, Pepito. Hey, presenting your wife. Feel my hips. Money. This woman is not my wife. Where is my wife? Shut up. You crazy? This woman is not my wife! Oye, loco. You want me to find another husband? He's always looking down to me. Before the revolution, he was married to a princesa. Carmelina. Carmela. This is the best security system money can buy. You'll be completely safe now. I am safe, Angel. No, no, no. Carmelina, no. No one is safe. I think of you here in this house alone. It's not a good world. I shouldn't have bought the condo. No, no. Angel, don't give up the condo. You need your independence. I would never forgive myself if something happened to you. You're the only family I have. You're everything to me. Mr. Diaz. Mr. Diaz. How many times have I told you to put the grilles on the window? Put these grilles on every window! Now I'm in prison. Ha! I dreamed I was in prison. I lost all my teeth. You dream about your manhood. You fear you have lost your virility. I've not made love to my wife for years and years. Abuelita, tell me, do you think she has gone with another man? Years and years is a long time. Azucar. This polish is some kind of sexy. Tonight, abuelita. Sexy American movie. Ave maria purisima! Oh, Santos. If you were alive, I would be inside of you right now. Sabroso. Que rico. Dios mio. It's a miracle. Oh, God. I'm still on duty. I got to go. We'll go to your house. Oh, God. Curfew. I'm still... I can't let you off the premises. Ohh... My hero. My United States freedom hero. Mmm... If you want me, I deserve a real bed. Okay. I'll tell you what. Friday, I'll get you out of here. I'll take you on a real date. To a disco? Right. Disco. Everything. I've got to go. Gate 14. Manana. I remember in Colima in October. A thousand butterflies. The breezes were sweet. It was never as hot as this. - Next year... - Next year... - In Havana. - In Havana. I just come from Cuba, senor. Believe me, it's hot. Look around you, my friend. Cuba is here. Senor, where is Coral Gables? I'll get some hierbabuena from the yard. What happened, Mama? He looked like the beggars in Malecon when I was a girl. So sad and familiar. He was casing the house, Mama. He look familiar? There was just something about him, reminded me of Havana. Are you sure it wasn't your husband, Mrs. Perez? Oh, no. Not him. Juan wore size nine. These are size 11. My mother's trying very hard to put the memory of my father behind her. Poor guy was probably looking for some yard work. The world's a pretty safe place, all things considered. I hate to see you sitting inside all day with your doors locked. You have to get out a little more. You should live a little. Maybe I will. Would you two like some lemonade? Another day. Mom, you don't offer cops lemonade. Silencio, por favor. It is August, and Miami's football teams have begun their practicing, which means that you have to get out tomorrow. Families of three or more, you stay here. We are finding sponsors. The rest of you will go on I-95 to tent city or will be transferred to military bases. I did not come here to live on a tent in a highway. This I can do in Cuba. I can't... Mr. Perez on the football post. Yes, you. Get down. Juan, go take him to the shower right now. General Armando Perez. From now on, he's your father. This man is not my father. If he says so, he's lying. He don't say nothing. He don't talk, which is good for the sponsor. Husband, wife, grandfather, that's a family. Not my family. Vaya, Juan. Go wash him. I don't even know him. I can't go in the men's shower. He can't go in the women's shower. You wash him. He's your papi. Dorita, I'm leaving. What do you want from me? All day I am going and doing laundry, finding relatives, anything so they don't take us to the military base. And you think you're too good to get your hands dirty. All I'm asking you to do is clean him up a little! A little! A little! A lit... Do it. When we get the sponsor and you're free, I don't care what you do. Senora, you are not kind. Maybe not, but when I'm not lying, I'm honest. Ha! Ay, this loca, she thinks she owns me. Be a man. Well you can be her husband now. I'm going to find my wife. Oye! Oye! Wait here. Don't forget about our date. Let me guess. Please. Please, please. Your husband's... Father? After 20 years. You must be very happy. Now the sponsors are coming. With only three members in your family, you are number 27. But who knows? Maybe your grandmother will make a sudden appearance. Huh? Maybe. I want you to get some false teeth for a man to save a marriage. Very old, like me. Value was about $20 gold. Down payment. Of course, abuelita. Felipe! Who is he? Where's his family? He's a Perez. He has no family. Oh, Felipe, my lost son. You came back. Don't die. Please. Okay, canine unit's on its way over to pick up the Doberman. I'm so sorry for your trouble. My brother Angel is very protective. Don't tell me... Older brother? No. I brought Angelito over with my little girl. You met Teresa. My husband stayed behind to look after the sugar cane. It's funny, you know... This is all I could salvage. Would you like some cafe Cubana? Hey, we're in no rush, are we, Officer Rhoades? No, sir. I'll go call in. Fresh-squeezed. You do this every morning? No. Today was the first day of the rest of my life. Had to start over myself a few years ago. Divorce. No kids. I don't know. You know, sometimes you start out with this moral impulse. You want to protect and honor the things you believe in. Work takes over. 10, 15 years down the line, it fills up the whole horizon. I mean, you can't see anything else. I guess family life doesn't mix with my line of work. Well, maybe you won't always have this line of work. I was just thinking that. Do you want me to deactivate this thing? I mean, you know, it's very sensitive. Oh, no, thank you. It's just a couple of wires. Come on. It'll take five minutes. Five minutes. Well, there is something. You tell your brother there's such a thing as being too secure, if you know what I mean. If I were you, I'd go buy yourself a little dog. They're good company, and they scare the hell out of the bad guys. A... Agent Pirelli. Dang. Who is this boy? Your son, Felipe. It's a miracle. I made a sacrifice thanking Babalu Aye. Dottie told me how he was almost taken from her arms when he was only a little boy... When you were still in prison. Oh. You should be grateful to los santos. Si. Where is the woman of the house? Ah. The Yankee security guard. Who could love such a woman? She's so unrefined.

Single males on the bus! We are waiting here for my wife. Wait for her on the bus. Go! - No, I can't. My wife... - Come on, let's go. That's my son. Come on. Hey! That's my son! Don't touch my son! Security, some support over here! - What? - My hero, wait. What's wrong? It's my first date in America, and I don't want the date to be finished so quick. Hey... I took you to a club, I bought you four drinks, three bucks a pop. Crash. What more could you ask for? I might have a beer here, somewhere. Shit, out of luck on the beer, babe. Oh, God! You get what you want, but don't I get what I want, too? Oh. Oh. Uh-huh. Right. I get it. Whoa! I'm slow, but I do get it. Steve Steverino. He finally gets it. What? Is that enough? It's what you're after, right? Just tell me when. Heh. Ho-ho! What... Ah. Oh, papi. Where am I? You are lying on a cot in the Orange Bowl in the United States, and we're all here with you. Your son and papi, too. Dottie, you are beautiful. You always know where you are on this earth. Welcome to the Church of the Resurrection. We are your sponsors. Tomorrow, you will begin your jobs. Flowers, flowers! Two roses. Gracias. Say hi to your wife for me, okay? You look like you're in the mood to spend some money. Wait for me, Dottie. I'm going to go get something to eat. Gracias. Uh, bread? Oy. If we put all our money together, sometime we can get our own flower shop. Would you like that, mi vida? I feel safe with you, Mama. "Mama"? You're not sleeping there. - Take the bed. - No, no, no. Don't be ridiculous. Get in the bed. I've forgotten all about beds. I wonder which side Carmela sleeps on. Carmela! Good morning, senor hard-on. Oh. I was dreaming. - Mmm. - Oh, Jesus! Your father is up in the tree! Oh! I saw you watching! Mrs. Perez, you cannot come outside like that. Tell her, Father. Go in and get dressed! Come down, papi. Oh. Good morning, Father. How are you? I know, I know. You're newly married. And you might think you don't need a lot of inspiration, but let me tell you, I got this bed for my girlfriend, and ever since, we dance the mambo and merengue every night. Look. This, my dear lovers, is beauty. Eh? Money can't buy taste. Angel? No, no, no. I can't have you people hanging out here. I'm very busy right now. Nice, eh? You've grown up. I guess you don't recognize me. No, I guess I don't, and I don't have time to play games right now. Here. Buy yourself some food and don't come back. It's Juan Raul, your brother-in-law. How did you know my brother-in-law? I am your brother-in-law. Come into my office. Enjoy, eh? Sit tight. I may need you. Yes? Sit down. What do you want? Money? I just want the truth, Angel. Ah, the truth. When did you get out? A few days ago, I think. Feels like a month. So much has happened. So, they let you out of El Morro, huh? I was not in El Morro. I was in Calvario. You knew that. This is you, isn't it? You are Angel Diaz, aren't you? You were in Coral Gables the other day. So, Carmela does live there. Is she okay? And Teresa, is she all right? My sister moved some time ago. If you were Juan Perez, you would know that. What is it? Has something happened? Has Carmela remarried? Is that why you don't want to tell me? Am I forgotten? What gives you the right to come in here asking questions about my family, huh? Angel, just tell me the truth. I'm prepared. Mmm. The truth is you are not my brother-in-law. Sit tight. I'll be right back. Call the police. Got a burglar here impersonating my brother-in-law. I'm calling the police right now, Mr. Diaz. Stay away from Carmela! Stay away from my sister, or I'll kill you! Ah! Maybe she hates me. But she could be married to someone else. I must know, papi. Is it possible you called the police and then forgot you called? Why would I do something like that? Mrs. Perez, someone called us. Maybe you're lonesome. I don't call police when I feel lonely. I have my daughter, Teresa. I take classes at Miami Dade. Batik, ceramics. Last winter, scuba diving. I love scuba. You scuba dive? So far, only in the deep end at the college. Come on. You got the keys out there. You got the Caribbean. Sometimes it's hard for me to do the things I want to do. I get nervous. So nervous, you keep calling the police. Rhoades, why don't you go inside and dust for prints or something? Ssst. Seems like whenever I see you, there's a dog chasing you or somebody breaking into your house. Look, Carmela, I know it didn't work out too well the other night, and I don't want to push or anything, but I have to go to D.C. Just for a little while. So, I just want you to know that I'm much better on second dates. So, maybe you can call me sometime? Please? What do you say? I'll think about it. Don't make me wait. You have a headache, titi? Mmm. What happened? You want something? My hair used to be so dark. Now, it's gray like an old man. I like your hair, mi amor. Silver is very aristocratic. Mama. I don't want to sleep alone. Can I sleep here with you? I like it when you call me Mama. Come here. On the floor. Tomorrow, we put the mattress. Thank you, Mama. Maybe we can buy you some new teeth. We have enough. $300. You smell like flowers. He hear us talk, and he took the money to buy you some false teeth. Oh, wake up! Good morning! The boy took the money. He run away. He my son. He don't steal from me. In the land of the blind, you know, the one-eyed man is king. Felipe going to come soon, and then you see. Can't get your car started? Uh, yeah, want to help? Nice car. You know, I love getting to the beach early. Am I doing this right? Beautiful! Perfecto! So, guess you're not going to the beach, eh? Let's go. Enough, Angelito. If I do this, there will be no more bars on the windows, no alarms, no police, no police dogs. Okay. But, Carmelita, promise me, promise me you carry this everywhere at all times. If you ever see that marielito... Boom. Promise me? I promise. You look beautiful. Now, just pretend that's the marielito criminal. When I stop the car in front, you go to the car in back, okay? You can do it. Like this. Don't you dare walk like that for another man. Come back here. I'll buy all your flowers myself. I could never have a husband so jealous like you. Flowers! You tempt me. You want to take them all? Gracias. Idiot! The light is... ♪ Red Cono, este marielito. I'm going to find out where this maricon lives. Parasites! Does a parasite wear high heels? Manana. He was just a little boy. An angel. I wish he really was our son. Except he would be dead now. We must not martyr him, mi amor. He was from the street, mixed up with bad people. Gangsters. He had no family. He wanted change. To be with us. Si. Maybe. Maybe he was just looking for somewhere to hide. The truth is so easily lost, Dorita. If we lie to ourselves, it opens the door to a world of madness. Why did we come to this terrible country? We must be strong, mi amor. Your father. What do you see up there, papi? Angelito. That's the one. You, imposter. I came here to tell you stay away from my sister, or I'll have you thrown in jail. You were my jailer in Cuba, Angelito. Twenty years, you keep me in prison. Torture. Because of you. In her letters, Carmela tells me of the money you sent. A river of money. I never saw it. I write to her, "Don't send bribes." But no, you must play the big man. Twenty years. Oh, we'll keep Juan Raul in here because Angel Diaz in Miami sends so much money. Jesus! If you want my sister, Carmela, why do you keep this whore? Oh! Oh, Angel! Ah, baby. Not a word of this to Carmela. Angel, no. It would break her heart to see what Juan Raul has become. Let me out of the car. I mean it, Angel. Let me out! I thought you knew something about love. Hey! Oh! I am burning. I am burning up. It's so... Felipe burning in hell. I believe hell is here on earth, Dottie. Hell is waiting for the worst to happen, for the sound of your own execution. And it never comes. Hell is waiting for the best to happen. Uh! And it never comes. Never comes. We're never safe. Our only deliverance is to stop waiting. To expect nothing. To love desperately, without hoping for another. Ah, Mrs. Perez? Dottie? Dorita. My name is Dorita. Can I talk to you a minute? Last night, I talked it over with Teresa, the daughter. This is very difficult for me to ask. Do you love Juan? Will you give him up? When I dream about coming here, I never dream about Juan. I want a man who is free. The way I thought the United States was free. Inside of him free. After so many years, how could the gods have planned it this way? Exactly. Angel thinks I'm stupid and romantic because I really, really think that Carmela and Juan belong together. She wait a long time for him. Longer than I would wait for a man. At the Varadero Festival tonight, I'll be singing. Then I will make my surprise announcement. A man and a wife who have not seen each other in 20 years, we are going to unite them right here. Don't tell Juan, okay? We're not going to tell Carmela anything. You're so handsome. What is it? - Is it Felipe? - Mmm. I love you. Never leave me. I want to dance with you. Hey! Whoo-ah! You look beautiful. Back. Come on. Oh, my God. Excuse me. Ha! Hey, Flavia! I'm sorry! I love you! Marielita soy. Cubanita soy. Juan Raul, no matter what happens... Dorita, no more waiting. Juan. Carmela! Juan Raul is here! Hey! Carmela! Look! It's Juan Raul! Look at me! Hey! Carmela! It's him! Look! There's Juan Raul! Gracias! Can't you see? Carmela? He's not the marielito! There are two very special people here tonight, a husband and wife who haven't seen each other in 20 years. He's not the marielito! Aah! Carmela, no! Angel! Angel! Juan. Titi! Titi! I'm okay. I'm okay. It's just my hand... Again. Call the doctor. Ah! Ay yi. Okay, family reunion. Big smile. You look so much like my mother. Oh, titi, you were so brave. Do you love me? Um, listen, we just wanted to thank you for everything. All your kindness to my father, I mean. It was nothing... Nothing. If there's something I can do for you... I'll see you at the hospital. The cops need to finalize some release forms before we can go, but I'll take care of it. You two relax. Maybe I should follow Angelito to the hospital. No. You guys take it easy. Flavia's gone with him. You have some catching up to do. Doesn't she look like my mother? She's always saying that. Oh, it's the eyes. So like your grandmother. I want to know all about her. I can't believe he's really here. In fact, I have a lot of questions for you, so, get ready, okay? Talk to him, Mami. You have been a good mother. No. Teresa is good. She's a good girl, but she's an American. Who could have imagined me having an Americana for a daughter? Does she remember me? She says she remembers dancing with you. But time goes by. It's hard to remember everything. Papi, just sign some papers, and we can go. Happy? I don't know. An hour ago, my life was clear for the first time in 20 years. And now... Just talk to him, Mami, the way you talk to me. I mean, whatever happens now, we'll always be the Perez family. I imagined this moment so many times, but never like this. But still, I'm sorry I came to you like this. Oh, no. I'm so happy you're alive. I'm glad I didn't shoot you. It would have been a privilege to die in your arms. I used to lie in the dark assembling your face like pieces of a puzzle. You're so beautiful. Exactly as I left you. I was only a child, younger than our Teresa is now. Younger than Teresa? Si. And you were not much older. Thank you. For keeping our family together. But now I feel so sad that a woman so beautiful and so young waited all this time. For only me. But you waited. Yes. But it was no sacrifice for me. In prison, you have no choice. I didn't have the courage to let go. I felt you close to me as if you were holding me. And I couldn't let go of you until you let go of me. And then, one day, I could no longer remember your face. I'm finished with dreaming. Dorita! Dorita. Corazon. You taste like sugar cane juice. Papi. Always, he's looking for Cuba.
