MINSK BELARUS Benji. Benji, do you copy? Benji. Oh. Shit. Where's Ethan? Uh. I can't talk right now. The package is on the plane. Yeah, I know. We're currently formulate a plan B although technically, it's a plan C. This isn't going very well. I am aware of that, Brandt. You're not helping. Where's Ethan? I don't know. We're on radio silence. That plane cannot takeoff, with the package on it. You understand? - We're working on it. Luther? What the hell are you doing there? You are supposed to be on an assignment in Malaysia. I'm in Malaysia, I've been here 2 days. Benji needed my help. I didn't need help. I just- I needed assistance, it's a different thing. The package is still on that plane. We understand the package is on the plane. We're trying to cripple it remotely. - You can do that. We can if the pilot left the satellite uplink switch on. Which he has. - And how do you access the uplink? It involves hacking a Russian satellite. - I can't authorise that. Which is why I didn't ask permission. We are under investigation for misconduct. The package is on-board. What do you want me to do? Uh. Luther. I'm reading a heat bloom, Benji. The engines are starting. Yeah. I'm aware of that. But I can't do anything until I'm connected to the satellite. Benji, you are connected. - Okay, Great. The package is still on that plane. Shut down the fuel pump. Uh. Mechanical are lockdown. What about the electrical system? - Oh, that might work. No. No. Hydraulics. - Okay, standby. No, they're encrypted. Benji, the plane. Yes! The package is on the plane! We get it! Can you open the door? Ethan? Where are you? - I'm by the plane. Benji, can you open the door? Uh. Can I open the door? Uh. Maybe. Open the door when I tell you. I'm on the plane. Open the door. How did you get in the plane? Not in the plane, I'm on the plane! Open the door! Benji. Open the door! Yeah-yeah-yeah... Okay, okay. Benji, open that door right now! - Yeah, I am trying. Come on, Benji. - Benji, open that door! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Yes, got it. That's the wrong door! Benji, not that door. The other door. The other door. Right. Yes, the other door. Okay, yes, yes. Sorry, sorry. My bad, my bad. Check it out. Alright. Look, I'm gonna open the para-door. How's that? Hey. Hey. MISION:IMPOSIBLE Nation secreta LONDON ENGLAND We're about to close. I won't be long. You looking for anything in particular. Something rare. Let me guess. Classical. Jazz. Sax. - Coltrain. Piano. - Monk. Shadow Wilson on the bass. Shadow Wilson played drums. Know why they called him Shadow? Because he had a light touch. You're in luck. I've a first pressing. It really is you. I've heard stories. They can't all be true. Good even, Mr. Hunt. The weapons you recovered in Belarus were confirmed to be VX nerve gas. Capable of devastating a major city. The bodies of the air crew were found less than 24 hours after they landed in Damascus. They were identified as low level Chechen separatist. With neither the access nor the ability to acquire the weapons they were transporting. This would support your suspicion that a shadow organization is committed to inciting revolution. by enabling acts of terror in nations friendly to Western interests. IMF suspects this to be the same shadow organization you have been tracking for the last year Also known as the Syndicate. IMF would be right. Normally, you and your team would be tasked with infiltrating and disrupting this terrorist network, but we have taken steps to ensure that this will not happen. Because, we, are the Syndicate, Mr. Hunt. And now we know who you are. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to face your fate. Pursue us, you'll be caught. Resist us, you'll be killed. And you precious Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions. Good luck, Mr. Hunt. This message will self destruct in 5 seconds. Mr. Chairman, the IMF's misadventures date back to my earliest days in the CIA when the IMF broke into the CIA to steal a list of covert operatives. And now, more recently a Russian warhead. - Disarmed Russian warhead. A Russian nuclear warhead. - Branded safe by Th IMF. Clipped the Transamerica Pyramid before plunging into the San Francisco bay. Saving the western atmosphere. This made possible by IMF agents who did willing provide the launch codes to a known terrorist. Do I have that right, agent Brandt? I can neither confirm nor deny details of any such operation without Secretary's approval. This was the same week after IMF infiltrated the Kremlin. Here's the Kremlin before. And the Kremlin after. I can neither confirm nor deny details of any operation... Without the Secretary's approval. Yes, we know. In fact, until this panel appoints a new Secretary, you really can't say much of anything, can you, agent Brandt? Well. I didn't write the rules, Mr. Hunley. Mr. Chairman, the so call Impossible Missions Force is not just a rogue organization, it is an outdated one. A throwback to an era without transparency and without oversight. Mr. Chairman. - The time has come to dissolve the IMF. Mr. Chairman. - And transfer the salvageable assets to the CIA. Mr. Chairman, the IMF has operated without oversight for 40 years. Now, are its methods unorthodox? Yes. - Mr. Chairman. Are it's results less than perfect? Absolutely. But without the IMF, to be force... - There'll be order and stability. Without the IMF... This panel recognizes the IMF's contribution to global security. But the events laid out by CIA director Hunley also show a pattern of once and brinkmanship and a total disregard for protocol. From where I sit, you unorthodox methods are indistinguishable from chance. And your results, perfect or not, looked suspiciously like luck. I'm afraid today is the day when the IMF's luck runs out. What are you doing here? Huh? I said: "What are you doing here?" What does he see in you, I wonder. Who is he? I want to see what is done. Why don't you take off the cuffs. And I'll show you. Vinter. You know who I am? Janik Vinter. They call you, the bone doctor. The funny thing is. You're officially declared dead, 3 years ago. Nice shoes by the way. Not his. Yours. We have instructions to talk, not to kill him. There are men who are broken in different ways. This one's a fighter. He'll die, before you turn him. Are you worry he's gonna take your place? You should go, before it gets ugly. Yeah, he's right. You should go. Now, let's see how tough you are. You, Janik. We've never met before, right? Follow me. Give me the gun. What're you doing? - I can't leave. Look. You can't stay. We just killed those men. We didn't kill them. You did. I tried to stop you. You got away. Who are you? You better hurry now. Good luck. No, wait. Wait! Where is he? He's heading to the north corridor. He has closed the gate. Hurry, don't let him escape. Quick! Stack-com 7. - Western Europe unsecured. Designator. - Bravo Echo One One. Connecting. This is Brandt. - Go secure. Go. London terminal is compromised. Repeat, London is compromised. Agent placed is down. Request immediate extraction. What happened? Who breached London? Do you've anything to go on? A face. He wanted something. Not information. He could've kill me, but he didn't. Okay, what do you think it means. - The Syndicate is real. They know who we're, how we operate. I think I know why they've been so hard to find. Just focus operations on gathering any available Intel regarding formal covert operatives. It doesn't matter what country or agency. Just as long as they are dead Or presumed dead. Start with Janik Vinter. He's also known as the bone doctor. I can't do that. - What? What're you talking about? The Committee has shut us down. Operations are to be handled over to the CIA. There is no more IMF. I've been ordered to bring everyone in. Ethan. - I understand. Ethan. - I understand, Brandt. We didn't have this conversation. I disappeared in London. You don't know where I am. If I'm dead or alive. This man you saw. Can you find him? I won't stop until I do. This may very well be our last mission, Ethan. Make it count. Brandt. Since we are going to be work together, I want you to choose your next works very carefully. Where is Hunt? I don't know. - Don't lie to me, Brandt. I have no way of contacting him. He's deep cover. Last I heard, he's tracking the Syndicate. Let's cut the bull. You know who we are. You know what we are capable of. How come the CIA has never discovered any actual Intel regarding this Syndicate. What are you implying? - Not implying, stating. Leveling an accusation actually. Hunt is both arsonist and fireman at the same time. I believe that the Syndicate is a figment of his imagination. Created to justify the IMF's existence. I'm going to find him, Brandt. And when I do, he will be called upon to answer for every wanton active mayhem he's responsible for. Welcome to the CIA. You'll never find him. Set your watch, Brandt. Ethan Hunt is living his last day as a free man. 6 months later HAVANA, CUBA CIA LANGLEY, VIRGINIA All right, everybody. Heads up. This is it. Alpha team prep. Standing by. Execute. - Langley brimstone, go. I say again. We are a go. Langley, there's nobody here. Langley brimstone. Face the north wall. ANOTHER ONE VANISHES HERE IS FLIGHT 606? FIRE GUTS CHEMICAL WEAPONS PLANT WORLD BANK DECLARES CRISIS B. Dunn VIENNA OPERA YOU'VE WON! Dunn. Is it that time already. Okay. I'm going to ask you a series of control questions. I know and I'm gonna answer truthfully. And then you gonna ask me to lie intentionally. State your name. - The King of Norway. See, that's a lie. I'm actually third in line to the throne. My brother was... Has Ethan Hunt contacted you? - Why would he contact me? Hunt has resurfaced. This time in Cuba. He... left these behind. Tell me what you make of them. I don't know. He's taken up scrap booking? Look at the photographs, Dunn. All of them are either missing or dead, everyone. All of them were government agents. Russian, French, British, Israelis, you name it. These are highly classified files and yet Hunt had no problem collecting them. And he always seems to be a step ahead of us. I wonder how? - Are you suggesting I'm helping him? That thought had cross my mind. 6 months, I have been here. Sifting through mountains of metadata and exabytes of encoded excrement. I had decrypted, processed, passed more data than anyone in my section. And yet every week, you hold me in here. And you ask me the same question, just in a different way. And today, you haven't answered it. You seem to thinks I have some kind of obligation to him. Okay, nothing could be further from the truth. Ethan Hunt is still out there in the field, and I'm stuck here answering for it We're not friends. I owe him nothing. That'll be all, Dunn. Welcome to Vienna, Benji. Missed me? Ethan, where are you? Where the hell have you been? No act... you know what? Please, don't tell me that, because it's just another thing I would have to lie about in my weekly polygraph. Everything is going to be fine. Just keep walking. But, make sure you're not being follow. ed Oh. I didn't win those opera tickets, did I? - No, I'm afraid not So, where do we meet? - We don't. For your sake, we shouldn't be seen together. You have mail. Who is he? - That's what we're here to find out. What I do know, is he's our only possible link to the Syndicate and I have reason to believe that he's going to be here tonight. But I can't find him alone. Are you in? Are you in? - Yes, of course. Of course. So, what's the play? - Simple. You find him, we tag him. I follow him wherever he goes. - And after that? After that you're on a plane, back at work Monday morning. No one is the wiser. - What? That's it? You're in enough danger as it is. I didn't want to involve you this much but I had no choice. Whoa. If you're gonna bring me all this way, you could at least give me something a little be more... you know, dramatic. Benji, we are trying to keep a low profile. You want drama, go to the opera. Are you seeing what I'm seeing? - Yes, I am. Am I correct in assuming that is the Chancellor of Austria? Yes, you are. - Did you know he's going to be here? No - Right. Well. We have a European Heads of State here, at the same time as we're looking for a nefarious terrorist. And I'm sure the two things are completely unrelated. - Benji. Mean while I'll try and overlook the fact that you're an international fugitive wanted by the CIA. - Benji. And this little unsanctioned operation is tenement-ed treasonous. - Benji. Because as you stated earlier, I will be back in my desk on Monday morning, playing video games and no one will be any be the wiser. The show's about to start, Benji. - Right. Just take your position, tell me what you see. - Okay. Nice tux, by the way. Stage is set. Ready lights. Ready lights. The final preparations ready. Stay alert, please. Join the IMF. See the world, on a monitor in a closet. Okay, I have eyes. Searching Talk to me, Benji. - Nothing yet. Standby. I know you're here. Where're you. Uh Ethan, I might have something for you. Can't confirm. Where? - Backstage, I will direct you Take the door on your left. He should be right in front of you. Benji, did you see that? - See what? A woman. What woman? Where're you? I can't see you. What happened? - I don't know Ethan, do you copy? Ethan, come in. Ethan, the lighting booth. Ethan, do you copy? Oh god. It's a flash wound. Sorry, ladies and gentlemen. Surround the building. Secure the exits. I've a way out. Interested? Lead the way. Anything you want to tell me? - No, not right now. How's the pace? - Don't wait for me. What's next? Alright. There. Shoes. Shoes, please. If anything happens to you... Nothing is going to happen to me. Stop the car! Get in. Go go go. What the...! She tried to shoot me. It doesn't make her a bad person. I'm gonna have to search you. - You have to let me go. Oh oh. Not a chance. I assume you're deep cover back in London but isn't this taking the role a little too far. Hang on a minute, you know her? Oh. We haven't formerly introduced. But I am pretty sure she's British intelligence. Ilsa Faust. You're Ethan Hunt. And... that shade is very hard to find. What were you doing at the opera tonight? - What? Aside from killing the Chancellor. Saving your life in London put me in a tight spot with some very dangerous people. I was sent to kill the Chancellor to regain their trust. Ha. So, you admit that you killed him? I went through the motion, that's not the same thing. You thought you put him in the hospital, take him out of harm's way. The same thing you tried to do. You're not gonna believe that, are you? What about the rest of her team? You means those other 2 idiots? I can only assumed they were redundancies. In case you didn't follow through. One man to kill the Chancellor, the other one to kill you. A test. Second one I failed, thanks to you. And the car bomb was insurance. We have a tail. Who is he? We're after the same thing, and I can help you. If you want to bring down the Syndicate, you've to let me out. They're closing. This has to look like an escape. So, you just throw me out anywhere. Tell me who he is. Oh! Oh. Change of plan. Throw her out! You have everything you need to find me. Less than 24 hours after we interviewed Benji Dunn about Ethan Hunt He was on a plane to Vienna with tickets to the opera. And within 6 hours of his arrival, the Chancellor was dead. Now, that might be circumstance to some public defendant. But to the CIA, that is actionable intelligence. Consider the moment, the possibility that Ethan's investigation lead him to the opera. And he's the one with the actionable intelligence. In any case. Finding Hunt is no longer our pet project. The Special Activity Division will now have full discretion. You mean shoot to kill? Whether Hunt lives or dies. It's entirely up to him. New identity, passport, cash, road map. There's a change of clothes in that bag, right there. Everything you need to make it to DC undetected. Once you're there, you'll have to inform on me. I'm suppose... what? Sorry, what? - Tell the truth. You came to Vienna believing you won 2 tickets to the opera. And I attempted to recruit you into assassinating the Chancellor, you refused. That is not the true. - Your life depends on them believing you, Benji. It'll go easier if you tell them what they want to hear. Ethan, at least tell me what this is all about. You recognized anyone? Him. - He's former KSA, German intelligence. Missing, presumed dead. He was at the opera tonight. This one too. Former Mossad. - Let me guess. Presumed dead. Tonight, I made it official. I was looking for him in Bosporus. The same day a car accident killed the visiting President of Malawi. He slipped away again in Jakarta. Hours before a passenger plane vanished over the Pacific with 236 passengers. I just missed him in the Philippines. Right before a fired petrochemical plant gassed a village of 2.000 people. You're saying these accidents are somehow connected. That missing plane was carrying the Secretary of the World Bank. That fire bank corrupted a global arms cooperation. That wreck triggered a civil war. These are no accidents. They're links in a chain. The work of a single organization, the Syndicate. A rogue nation. Trained to do what we do. Inbuilt with a new sense of purpose. Destroy the system that created them. Regardless if who's in the way. An anti-IMF. And since Hunley shut us down, they've been escalating unchecked. Killing the Chancellor tonight was a statement The start of a new phase. Or they could just be a series of random disasters. He was there. Everytime. Just like he was there tonight. I'm sure of it. I don't know who he is, where he's from. How he's funded But I know he's the key. Ethan, this is what I sign up for. Let me help you find him. - That's why I brought you here. In the first place. And look what happened. I can't protect you. That's why I need you to leave. It's not your decision to make, Ethan. I'm a field agent. I know the risks. More than that, I'm your friend. No matter what I... con a polygraph every week. Now you called me because you needed my help. And you still do. So, I'm staying. And that's all we're gonna say about that. Okay - Good Where do we start? Ilsa. Right. And how do we find her? She said we've everything we need. We had an agreement. You send me to do a job, I'd do it. But my way, not yours. - When did I deviate? You put 2 more gunman at the opera tonight. One of them try to kill me. You missed. I missed because Ethan Hunt was there looking for you. Ethan Hunt is in Vienna because you allow him escape in London. Vinter would've kill him in London and that's not what you asked for. Twice now you've let him slipped away. Curious. Are you questioning my loyalty or my ability. Can't decide. - I've told you before. Trust me or kill me. But If you're going to kill me, be the man. Do it yourself. Did he say anything? He knows about Morocco. - What did he know about Morocco? He knows about the power plant. He doesn't know what's in it. Find him, please. He'll find me. I've him seen to that. Well, that's interesting - What is it? It's a SCIF. Secure Computer Facility offline, ultra-contained. It's impossible to hack in from the outside. It's essentially a digital safety deposit box. Very strange thing for a young lady to be carrying in her sundries. Where's it located? - Morocco. Morocco. CASABLANCA MOROCCO Now, what brings you gentlemen to Casablanca? Good to see you - What couldn't you tell me over the telephone? The Chancellor of Austria was assassinated. We believe that Ethan and Benji were there. Huntley's handed this over to Special Activities Division. We need to find Ethan before they do. That's where you come in. Not interested. - Okay. Look, Luther. Look, man. I know Ethan. I don't know you. All I know about you is that you chose to work for Hunley. Yeah, all I know about you is you chose to resign. You don't have to worry about Ethan. They'll never catch him - No, they're not going to catch him. No. This is the CIA, this is Hunley we're talking about. Thing are out of control And they're going to kill him. They're going to kill Ethan. They're going to kill Benji. We have to get to them first. Are you going to help me? You need to understand something. Ethan is my friend And if I have 1 second of doubt whose side you're on. I believe you Alright. - Alright. What do I have to go on? - Not much. And not a lot of time. His name is Solomon Lane. He created the Syndicate. Where does he come from? He's former British intelligence. Well. If British intelligence knows the Syndicate exist, why don't they just tell the CIA? Because they don't want anyone knowing the Syndicate was created by one of their own. I was sent undercover to earn Lane's trust. And eventually identifying the members of his organization. For the first time in 2 years, I'm close to knowing who they are. Lane had a ledger. It contain the identities of his operatives, his terrorist associates, the entire inner workings of the Syndicate. One of his agents stole it hoping to blackmail him. He kept it in a secure computer facility for safe keeping. He died being interrogated for the access code. Leaving Lane with a serious problem. So the key to crushing Lane is sitting in a computer just waiting for someone to take it? So why hasn't Lane just send someone to steal it? Oh, he has. He sent me. And I can tell you. It's impossible. The facility is hidden beneath the local power plant under military guard. And the only way to download the ledger is through the central computer terminal located there. To reach the terminal, you'll need to pass the main gates. Access the elevator with fingerprint recognition And open 3 separate combination locks. Well, that's easy. We just impersonate the agent who stole the ledger in the first place. And I get to wear a mask. Unfortunately, even if you can make it through every other security measure you won't beat the last one. That's because it's protected by gait analysis. A step beyond facial recognition. These cameras actually know how the agent walks, how he talks, how he moves, right down to his facial takes. So, what you're saying is, no mask can beat it. We're busted before we could even get into the vault. And I wind up in a Morocco jail playing mommies and daddies without a mother strangler. Okay, I don't get to wear a mask. And there's no other way into the computer lab? - No other way in. Air Shaft? - 6 inch diameter pipe. Foundation? - 12 feet of concrete, top and bottom. Electrical conduit? - Bottom line is, there's no way into that terminal unless your profile is pre-installed in the security system. Profile? Where're the profile stored? All security data is stored offline in the liquid cooler aid. Here, inside the torus, liquid cooled. You mean that thing is under water? Yes. - Yes. Okay. So, to get the ledger, one of us needs to enter the torus and change the security profile. So that the other one can access the computer without being caught. That's the only way. - That's the only way. Can I get in through there. What's that? - That's the service hatch. It can only be opened from the inside. If you try and open it from the outside, you'll be hit with 70 thousand gallons of pressurized water. Where does the water come from? Desalinized seawater flows through the intake. in the pipeline. And before you ask, the system is designed to shut down automatically if any metal enters the intake. No oxygen tanks. Alright. Well, how long will it take to free swim from the intake to the service hatch. 2 minutes. With the current at full power. Well. Then, you just have to hold your breath for 2 minutes. What about installing the security profile? - Well. That's gonna be like a minute tops. So, I have to hold my breath for 3 minutes? You can do that. But I think you're overlooking, is the physical exertion. The more you exert yourself, the faster you consume oxygen. Don't worry about him. Alright. All he has to do is install the fake profile before I get to the gait analysis. You said it yourself, it's the only way That doesn't sound impossible. Satellite over-watch covering all 7 continents, DNA profiling, facial recognition, drone surveillance, drone strikes. So, how are we suppose to find Ethan and Benji before they do? I'm not even looking for them. I'm looking for her. What do you mean? These sketches, what do you see? Ethan's not exactly sure who this guys is. But this woman, he knows her. He trust her. I'm betting that if he's not already with her, he's on his way. Find her, find Ethan. Tell me it's possible to pull facial recognition of a sketch. For mere mortals, no. For me, I could've done this at home. Alright. How long is this going to take? - Found her. CCTV picked her up at the airport in Casablanca. DISAVOWED DISAVOWED - What the hell? She's bad news. Card. - Hello. Sorry. Your card is not working. - Benji, we're in. Released Thank you. One more time. You have 3 minutes. 2.5 minutes to switch the security profile. 30 seconds to escape through the service hatch. Remember, conserve oxygen. Don't move a muscle if you don't have to. I'm in the elevator. That current will carry you to a torus. Once you're there, I'll shut it down. Important note. The profile is in slot 108. And a slightly more important note, if you haven't switched that profile before I reach the gait analysis, I'm dead. Thank you, Benji. What's the problem? - The cooling system is rebooting... by itself. Oaf. All systems' normal. Clearing systems at full power. SERVICE HATCH SECURE No, no, no, no, no, no... AUTHORISED You're alright. You're okay. See. What did I told you. Difficult, absolutely, but certainly not impossible... Jesus, is he alright? What happened? What happened? Okay. Okay. Here. Hey. I misjudged you. Hey, man. Hey. You okay? How're you doing? Hey, buddy. Benji. - Yes, it's Benji. You did good. You take a moment, alright. Just-Just take a moment. There's nothing a little sunshine and fresh air won't fix you. You'll be as right as rain. - What are you doing here? Look-look-look... We got it. I knew we'll get it. Listen. I don't want to sound ungrateful, okay. I appreciate everything you do for me, but... one of these days, you're gonna take it too far. We got it. We're gonna nail that... Wait. Wait. I thought you said you can find him? I said I could locate him. You've to find him. Right. SEARCHING SEARCHING Where's Hunt? He's dead. Oh. That really hurts! Can you walk? - Yes, I can. We have to get to her before Lane does. Whoa-whoa-whoa... Are you okay to drive? I mean. A minute ago you were dead. What are you talking about? This is not gonna end well. There she is. Stairs, stairs, stairs! Stairs, stairs, stairs! Ah! God damn it. Whoa. Hey? I found them. Come on, man. Shit. It's a high-speed chase. You just had to get the 4 by 4, didn't you? Hey, look. Don't blame me. You chose the car. You just had to have it! - Do you want me to drive? Do you want me to drive? - Look, it's a stick. Look at this. Look how slow you're going. Speed it up. Who's this guy? Shit! AWW! Go-go-go- Go! I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Ho! Whoa-whoa-whoa... Here they come! What're we gonna do? Gun! Do you have your seat belts on? What? You're asking me that now? Hang on! - Ah! Aww! Are you good? Things... got a little out of hand. Aw! Look out! Okay. We're good? Oh, hi boys. What did I miss? Woo. That look sharp. Careful, careful. So, what do we do now? Please tell me, you made a copy of that disk... Of course I made a copy. So where are we going? It's a ledger. The Syndicate's entire infrastructure. Who they are, the politicians they control, and where the money comes from. It's everything you want to know. What makes you think this so-called ledger is authentic? Why would Lane want it so badly if it wasn't authentic? Why would he ever let you have it if it was? Did you never stop to consider he may want me to have it? Misinformation, manipulation. What he does exercise, what he's trained to do. Lane lies to you, you sell his lies to Hunt. Together, you both are compromised. That's his ultimate objective. This may be authentic. But there's only one person I trust to verify that information. You. No. My orders were to deliver you information regarding the Syndicate. Your orders were to infiltrate the Syndicate that we may learn more about them first hand. This isn't prove, it's a test, like everything else. The only way to pass, is to go back. I can't do that. I betrayed Lane's trust too many times. And in every instance, you did so on you own volition. He was going to tortured and killed an American agent. And you should've let him, and you would still have Lane's trust. This is the trade, Hunt understands that. I wasn't going to let him die. He is our ally. There are no allies in state craft, Ilsa. Only common interest. As it stands, Ethan Hunt is a man without a country. This makes killing him decidedly less complicated. Are you ordering me to kill Hunt? Good god, no. Nothing so crude as that, no. Lane will order you. And to regain his trust, you will do it. You sent me to do a job. I did it. Now, you bring me in. Might I remind you, you're without a country of your own. The director of the CIA called me inquiring about you personally. Of course to protect your cover, I had to lie. So, as far as the Americans are concern, you're a rogue assassin, a target of opportunity. A precious few people know about your true identity. It would be unfortunate if we forgot. You see, there really is no choice, Ilsa. You're going back. Glad to know you're still with us. What? What's happening? I can't open it. What do you mean you can't open it? I mean I can't open it, ever. That's a red box. A what? - It's a red box. The British government uses it to transport national secrets. Doesn't sound good. Meaning it's triple encrypted. You don't get into that thing
