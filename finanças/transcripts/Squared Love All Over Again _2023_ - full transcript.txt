Hey, babe. We're almost there. I'm gonna look at the magazines. Sounds good. Hey there. Look! Um, would you mind signing my magazine? Um, sorry. I don't have a pen with me. Oh! You are such a superstar. Look at these! Excuse me, excuse me. Can I have an autograph please? Of course. Oh, I see. Welcome back to reality. - You turn your phones on? - What's going on? You said that if we go on vacation for a few months, all this would blow over. It's nice to see you too, Monika dear. - Did we miss anything important? - Not that much. The Polish soccer team fought like hell and lost, like they always do, parsley is twice as expensive now because of inflation, and the country fell in love with Monika. You're everywhere. And me? And, uh, how could I forget? Welcome home, buddy. Okay, bye! SQUARED LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN - Hi, Miss Monika! - Hi, Miss Monika. Hello there. - Hi, Miss Monika. - Miss Monika! Monika! Hey! Oh! Someone looks like they just returned from the best vacation of their life. Take me with you next time. - Come on! We'll be late! - You know she's planning to major in film? The girl films everything on her phone. Not kidding. It was nice to see you! - Oh, hey! - Darling! - Hi, dear. - Just don't know who it is we have here. Klaudia or Monika? Wow. Take a look at her. She has the audacity to come back on the first day of school looking all tanned and well rested. Darling, a teacher shouldn't look sunburned, they should look burned out. Isn't that the case? - Of course, of course! - Well, I've missed you too. Yeah, right. Like I believe that. Relaxing on a beach thinking about school... Let me tell you, this year is going to be great. That's not right! These are double standards! No, no. Listen! I understand, but there's only so much... My voice should be heard! Support our children! Everyone, please! Please try to stay calm, okay? My Ola was supposed to be in this class from the very beginning! I can assure you that all of our students have grown... Hey. What's your name, sweetie? Oh! Ms. Monika! Oh my God. Miss Monika, you have to admit my little Ola into your class. - Please, this is very important! - Very important! But we can't admit everyone into Miss Monika's class! The rest of our teachers are just as good! - They aren't on magazine covers - Exactly! - Or in commercials. - I'm going to excuse myself. And I want to see you, Miss Grabarczyk, in my office right now. Boss, the pretty boy's back. I report, mission accomplished. The vacation went well, the car's in good condition. I guess it's time to get back to work. And Monika? Monika's wonderful. No, I'm asking where she is. Oh. She went right back to school, but she'll be done in a bit. Well, I've gotta go. Sports cars won't rate themselves, you know. And how do you rate mine? Absolutely beyond compare. Bye! What a lucky bastard. Hush. Come on. Oh my precious little babies! Don't you worry. Daddy's home. And I won't leave you again for a long time. My buddy, hello! What do you have for me today? Let me check, okay? Well, it looks like the amount you're expected to get today is going to be... Oh. Nothing. Good one, good one. But, seriously, tell me, how much am I going to get? Excuse me, could you help me with something please? Sure thing, ma'am. Oh, be right back. Really? - Hey, sweetie. - Hello. Marzena! You finally got that promotion you deserve. Congratulations. I'll save you the time and cut to the chase. I can't let you in, sir. Your pass is canceled. Come on. That's gotta be a misunderstanding. Hey. Come on, boss. You are the boss now, correct? Well, since you ask so politely... N-no. Absolutely not. Security, can you come in please? Enzo? - Who are you? - Marcin. I'm Alicja's new right-hand man. Where is Szymon? There was a nervous breakdown. Couldn't handle the stress, or the pace either. Apparently he's having the vacation of a lifetime on Zanzibar, so... - Oh, he actually went to Mielno? - He did. - Alicja, is she here? - She's not. As of today, the company has terminated all of your contracts, I'm afraid. You've lost access to your company card, your sports cars, as well as your cell phone. Oh, this is a prank, right? All those hidden cameras gonna pop out? Unfortunately not. Listen... Apparently, this all has to do with some model, or teacher, or something. Maybe some kind of affair. But Alicja was the one who dumped me. Hey. I wouldn't worry about it all that much. If you ask me, this isn't about jealousy or wanting a different fit for the company. No. I think Alicja wants to destroy you because it's fun for her. It's a joke. But as they say... no hard feelings. So, your things please. Or should I just call security? Not the private car, the company car please. And the card. Did she really fire me? "Fired" is such a harsh and ugly word. We'd prefer the expression "between jobs." You know, just an impasse. Um, It's best to think of it as a, uh, new start. Stefan. Well, Miss Grabarczyk, I had a feeling this was going to be an uphill battle after the summer. I knew there was going to be some pressure, some tension, but seriously, already? On the first day? I totally understand, headmaster. I'll do better. Well, you really have to want this job. You have to want to teach those children. Your performance has been satisfactory, but, honestly, that's not enough. You will have to put in a lot of extra work. Also, couldn't you have picked up the phone once when you were on vacation? All these crazy journalists kept harrassing the school. Um, uh, I suppose I could teach some extra classes, then. - Free of charge. - Oh! Well, I guess it seems we have an understanding with each other. But please know that this is your last chance. I don't want to have to deal with a celebrity. Is that understood? - Is that understood? - Yes it is, sir. Excellent then. My daughter has been completely overlooked and neglected in the school's administration process. And, I mean, despite being part of the list... Excuse me, but what's going on? I would like to make a public statement. But not right here. Could we move away from the school's main entrance, please? Don't worry, darling. Don't worry. Follow me. Over here. Come on. Let's go a bit further. As for my statement... See you! Miss Monika, we'd still like a few words! Hit it. BUY TICKET ERROR CHOOSE THE AMOUNT Enzo? This is insane! You're on the same bus as me! Wait... wait a second. Uh, does that mean they're introducing a line of... sports buses or something? Enzo... That's Enzo. It's Enzo. I'd rather see my naked butt on billboards than this, you know. I've always said that the naked butt has feelings, a mind, a heart and dreams. And now people are finally realizing that. I keep getting offers for Klaudia. I mean, don't you think it'd be a good idea to take advantage of that? Why don't you just tell them Klaudia's retired? All right. How does this idea sound? One last interview as her so you can tell your side of the stories, nip any rumors in the bud, and Klaudia a proper send-off. What do you think? - Fine. One interview, then. - Just one interview. Who will interview me? It'll be with Rafał Wiśniewski. - Forget about it. - What? News sure does travel fast. Welcome to the natural habitat for gossip. Krzysztof! Hold on. Krzyśtof! Krzyśtof! Long time no see, man! You look great! How did you lose that much weight? Stress. Funny we should bump into each other. Um, I was just thinking about those shows you offered me, and it turns out... No. That's not gonna work. What do you mean it's not gonna work? I'm moving on to a new chapter... Well from what I heard, someone else started that new chapter for you. I'm not stupid enough to stand up to Alicja. In fact, no one is. What are you talking about? Krzysztof! I need to ask you for a favor. - Can we talk about it later? - Later? Two minutes until we're live. One, two. Come on. Come on. Let's move, guys. There he is. So first, Daniel Nowacki, writer and columnist. He wrote, "Inner Harmony." Then Monika Grabarczyk. Elementary-school teacher and model named Klaudia. - She is in a relationship with... - Enzo. I read your magazines. And I'm a fan of your show. Could you just this once make an exception, and, uh, try and go somewhat easy on Monika? What do you think, my sweet friend? Enough. It's fine, thanks. We're live in one minute. What we've got here, um, is, uh, your newly-published book, uh, "Inner Harmony." I read it. - Nice. - How long to write it? To write about harmony one must first find it within oneself, that can take a while. So ideal family, professional success. Your life seems to be in total harmony. Harmony is not always about the external circumstances and factors. You need to find that harmony within yourself. You need to first listen to your inner voice. Oh, that! Yeah. So it was that inner voice that told you to have an affair with a 20-year-old secretary? Great. So is cheating on your wife essential to reaching a state of pure Zen? Is that what you want us to take away from your book? I don't have to listen to all this nonsense. That's perfect. Get me a close-up on the guy as he's leaving. What a waste of my time! All right. But Daniel, don't forget about your state of inner harmony, right? Now get the audience reaction. Oh, that's perfection! Please join me in welcoming our next guest, Monika Grabarczyk! Hello there. Ouch! Ooh, that is a strong handshake. Stressed out? Well, I saw what happened a few seconds ago. Ah, so do you think that he didn't deserve all that? On live television, in front of the entire country? He'll remember that lesson. So pat yourself on the back for that one. Do you find it difficult to show your face in public? I mean, since your bare buttocks adorned most of the billboards in this city... I see you've prepared for a, um, pretty dignified conversation. I bet the children you teach are happy to recognize you as the sexed-up model on all those billboards they pass by on their way to school. I had a good reason to work as a model. What's yours for being an asshole? Ooh! She's so rude. Especially for an elementary-school teacher. You're rude, you know? And you're also pretty rude for a celebrity. Actually, I'm just a trusted reporter. Well, that's good to know. 'Cause in that case, I'd like to be interviewed by a reporter. Otherwise, I might just walk off set right now. - Here. - Thank you. So did she say what this is about? She didn't, but I don't think you should be worried. I... I read through those reports. I mean, how much did viewership fall? Like, seven percent? - Um... - Eight percent. Graphs and tables never lie, isn't that right? Those graphs and tables show something I don't very much care for. I'll be honest. It's beyond terrible. Well, at least soon I'll be starting to host that new, uh, kids show. My face will be all over the city. And with that kind of, uh, exposure, right...? The talk show viewership will skyrocket, and we'll be back on top. Are you sure about that? We did some focus group testing recently. We expected a catastrophe, but it was somehow even worse than that. Our kids show could be completely obliterated by your image. That is, unless, of course, we find you a female co-host who everyone loves. - Good joke. - Hmm. It's not a joke? Oh man, you've gotta be kidding. I think you should consider this one. - It's a really good offer. - Mm-hmm. But I don't wanna work with him. I... I didn't mean you. Oopsie. You won't be working with him, just next to him. It'll be just fine. I won't work with him, next to him, in front of him, or under him. No way. There's no way I'm doing that. But it's a really good offer. Your performance made the viewership of a doomed show skyrocket to record highs. And that's not all. The audience loved that you spoke your mind and really put him in his place. You should think about it. Might be a great chance. - May I? - Sure, let's take a picture. Oh, um, hello. Uh, you know where I can find Miss Monika? - Um, down that way, right? - Um, yeah. - Yes, there. - Down that way? - There. Yes, there. - Thank you so much. Check it out. Monika's really pulling in all the cute guys now. - Here? - Right there. Yeah, that one. - Um... - What are you doing here? I feel bad about how we started out. Well, that's okay because there's nothing for us to continue. Monika, you're the only one who can save my career. I don't think so. - But this is a talent show for children. - Yeah? It's a completely different kind of show. I'm not interested in it. Consider that every child on the show will get the opportunity to showcase their best talent. They'll have a national platform and, uh, free consultations with coaches for singing, dancing, or whatever they want from us. - Let me help you with that. - You don't need to. I got it. Also, don't say "us." There's not and will never be any "us." Ugh. Jeez, how can you be so stubborn? Leave me alone. I don't wanna talk to you, and don't wanna work with you. I can assure you that everyone who loses the competition will be referred to a cultural center so they can keep honing their craft. Monika, I want what's best for those children. Part of the ad revenue made from the show will go toward orphanages. And I've... ...I've already made the producers promise that I'll be able to work with an educator. - I can do it! Pick me! - No. No, I'm sorry, dear, but you've got a face that's much better suited for radio. But I suppose I could give it a try. - You think your face belongs on TV? - Yes, it does. There are other educators who'd like the job. - Yeah. - Come on. Care to tell me what's going on? Do you know how huge of an opportunity this is for your school? For your students? Even for you, headmaster. Uh, so do you hear anything? - Ugh. He doesn't stand a chance. - Which one? - The headmaster! - Rafał! Ugh. I've noticed that you're a very authentic person. That attitude plays well on camera. What if it turned out you're a natural entertainer? I can allow you to have Miss Monika every week for one full day. And if the camera likes you, prepare to be up to your neck in offers. A day and a half. Have you ever considered being an actor on television? All right. We're done. It's still no. - Why don't you call someone? - I did, man. I called everyone, but I couldn't get anywhere. Some people hung up on me the second I said your name. Alicja really blacklisted you from the entire industry. - Here's a coffee. - Black? Yeah, no. This one's yours, this one's yours. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. So what am I gonna do? Nothing. We're not doing anything. Let's wait for this to die out. Let the industry find someone else to blacklist. And if they don't? Then drop it. Find something else to do, like homemaking? - Homemaking? Like you? - What's wrong with homemaking? Should I sit around and waste my time waiting for Ania's mom to finish up her worldwide trip? You ever even bake bread before? I had no idea kneading dough could be so relaxing, you guys. Dough might be relaxing for you, but canceled credit cards are definitely not, Mr. Breadbaker Homemaker. We're in the 21st century. You're telling me a working woman and a stay-at-home man would be shocking news, not to mention Monika? Stop it. Enough. Enzo, you gotta have some savings, right? Yeah. Of course I've got savings. I saved up some money, I went and invested in stocks, in bonds, and crypto... Never mind. I got it. Okay, okay. - Got one more idea. - Yeah? I can get you a meeting with someone in the next few days. How does that sound? Ah! I think I got it. Someone from the industry? Uh, to a degree. But I do think you'll crush the meeting. Besides, you can always fall back on those advertisements and campaigns. Yeah. No one can keep this guy from his ads. - Yeah. - Hmm? - Okay? - Okay. Hey! What are you guys doing? That's my ad you're painting over. Sure, man. I was supposed to be up there too, but I didn't make the photoshoot in Atlantis. If you like, we can take a photo of you and that billboard up there. Come on! Huh. Hello. Hey, I know you're not picking up calls, answering emails... I thought I made myself clear. He just doesn't give up, does he? If this doesn't convince you, then... I promise I'll leave you alone. My name is Zosia, and I'm five-and-a-half-years old, and I really like to sing. And I like to dance and take ballet classes. And I'd like a white dress. A new one, from the store. I like to play the piano, but our teacher said it's too expensive and that I'll have to wait. I like to draw comics, but I'm embarrassed because I don't know if I can draw that well. Everyone deserves a chance, Monika. Hi, honey! I'm back! I heard there's a cool movie playing. You wanna go see it? Wow, is it messy in here. You know what? I'm not in the mood for a movie. Oh really? Why is that? Well... You won't believe who I bumped into. Uh-huh. So, he hasn't given up? He hasn't, but I won't give up either. I just don't wanna do it. - All right, then. - Hmm. Show business, huh? Sure can be tough. - Mm-hmm. - It's cruel, capricious. - Anything else? - And it's completely unfair. So how about you leave it, then? Hmm. If I can do it, you can do it too. Babe, you all right? They fired me. What? For real? - You got fired from the magazine? - From everywhere. Hi, Dad. - Hey. - So sorry. I got held up. You didn't bring any flowers? I forgot. I'm sorry about that. Oh. Hey, what is it? Some celebrity guy wants me to host this show with kids. So Klaudia's coming back? No, this time they want Monika. Well, they made a really good choice. To be honest, I don't really know Klaudia, but Monika's a wonderful person, and she's pretty great with children. What... what's wrong? I don't know, I'm kinda stressed out. Do you think I should say yes to these guys? Of course, you should. You'll say yes. Yeah, I know you will. You're just like your mom. She was always the first to try new things. Even when she was nervous. I couldn't keep up with her. All right. I'll buy those flowers. All right. I'm turning it up. And the ones on the side Is that okay? I have to admit you look very beautiful today. That video was too much. In here, maybe? But it worked though, didn't it? - We're all set. - Mm-hmm. We're ready to start rehearsal. - Monika, a bit to the right. - To the right? Just a bit more. Bit more. Yeah. Just try to stay under the light. All right, attention! Camera! Dream Academy with Rafał Wiśniewski and... Monika Grabarczyk. Welcome to a show that will exceed your wildest expectations. With us, you'll meet new people, new faces, and new stories. And a brand new host too. We promise to work together and not against each other, isn't that right? Each week we'll be selecting contestants who, under the watchful eye of our jurors, will wow you with their talents. and those who impress our judges will face off in the grand finale. Monika? Hmm? Isn't it true that in the grand finale... ...the viewers get to decide who wins the competition? Yes, it is, Rafał. The finale will be decided by the viewers who will vote via text message. And now, let's meet our judges. Stop! Stop! Let's take it from the top. Relax. We're all here to support each other, okay? Okay. Yeah. So I sit on the sofa, he comes in, and then there's a red light. - I start talking, and it becomes dark. - Oh really? Wow. That's crazy. - Hi. What's up, honey? - Hey. Going for a new look? The tortured artist is very in right now, haven't you heard? We're meeting tomorrow at 9:00, right? Yeah, um... - Got it. - You should've seen us, man. She's fire. For me, all I need is to see Monika every morning. I'll see you tomorrow. What, did you skip leg day? See you! Come on. Come on! Today wasn't that bad. How's Rafał? Oh, come on. What do you mean? Well, I saw your little cockfight earlier. Cockfight? What are you talking about? Babe, you have nothing to worry about. Yeah, sure. Rafał is just some famous, handsome, confident... - And what else? - Why don't you tell me? But he's still not you. Can I get you anything else? Uh, actually the check, please. I'll pay with card. No. I can pay with cash. - No, honey, no. It's okay. - I'm paying for dinner. No, please. Just, um... Perhaps I can tempt you with our selection of desserts, hmm? I'll be right back. Honey, stop. It's really not a problem. It's not up for debate. We'll continue this when I get back. Um, may I? Mm-hmm. There you go. - Hey! - Uh... The waiter was just finishing his shift, so... But next time it's on you. You're not getting out of it. You missed your one chance. Oh. Watch where you're going there, bud. Hello there, girls. Kazik? I didn't expect to see you here. I'm playing the guitar. Are your parents here with you? Ah. It's nice to see a familiar face. Headmaster. So I thought it would be a good idea for our school to be represented in this competition. Especially since I allowed you to take part in it. So make sure you do not forget that, understand? Especially when Kazik's up onstage. Now, it you'd please excuse us, he has an interview to attend soon. Do I really have to do another interview? Come on. Fingers crossed. Okay. Right over here. Right here. Here we are. Okay. - This is Kazik. - Hello there. He is a classical guitar virtuoso and he'll be playing Bach. I feel good about today. ROMANTIC DINNER WHOSE SUGAR MAMA IS THIS CELEBRITY? Oh God. Well, it can still be a good day, nonetheless. Excuse me, sir! - Good morning. - Morning. I need a ride to Montażowa? Montażowa... You know it's rush hour. How much? I can tell you're in a hurry, so how about 60 zlotys? - Really? - Yeah. You getting in the back or not? I'm outside. What floor is the meeting? UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE VOCATIONAL ACTIVATION CENTER I believe we had an appointment today. You're looking for a job? Yes. Hmm. He's the one to speak with. Hmm. You're unemployed? Yes. You're looking for work? No. I was just passing by. Look, man. I'm just trying to do my job and help you out. What is your profession? Male model, master of ceremonies, writer, expert. Yeah. But what can you do? Hmm. Host parties, generate discussions, sleep with women, beautiful women... Mr. Tkaczyk, do you have any skills that actually translate to a professional career? That's what I thought. I'm... I'm an engineer. I specialize in sports cars. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, okay, So, I'll register you in the system, and when Poland starts producing its own brand of Lamborghini, we'll get in contact with you, hmm? Anything else? We have about 50 contestants today. You think you can you handle that? I work with children every day, but thanks for the unnecessary concern. I just want you to make a good first impression. Impression isn't the most important thing. Well, no, I suppose it isn't. One, two, one, check. - Hey, guys. Are we ready to roll? - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. One question per kid, and then push them out onstage. Sir, um, sorry, but haven't you ever heard of stage fright? Yes. Yes, I have. I learned it yesterday working with you. - Krzyśtof... - No, "Krzyśtof." Stop wasting time. We're a half hour behind, okay? - Get to work! - Hmm. Well, get to work. What do you think about these guys? He's doing his best. - She's just here for the children. - Hmm. Pretty boring. Well, so? Plan B? You sure about that? Yes, absolutely. It's about time we turn up the heat up. I'm on it. Stefan, let's go! Oh my God! I'm so sorry! Wow. He's good! - Wow! Honey, you're so strong! - Yes! Go, go, go, go, go. Yes! APPLAUSE! Excuse me, please. Excuse me. - Headmaster, please. You can't do that! - I'm here for emotional support! Ladies and gentlemen. Dear viewers, let's all give a big hand... a big hand for Kazik! Who's a student at my... a student at my school! That man is hungry for fame. I think he'll go far. Except he's not the one competing, is he? All right, then. The laundry. That's great. As you can see, everything's under control. Uh-huh. Yeah, I see. I wanted to take you for a walk. Once you clean all this up, I'll be waiting outside for you. - Could you give me a... - No. Hand? Don't you worry, it'll be fine. You're young, you still have time. I'm sure you'll find a job sooner or later It's never too late to start something new in your life, you know? And if anyone can do that, it's Enzo. Who's Enzo? I'm only Stefan Tkaczyk now. Stefan? I... I'm Bazyli. Is your name seriously Bazyli? You know what? I used to specialize in fancy cars like these, and now all I do is repair old, worn-down, beat up pieces of junk. Just like me. Bazyli, it's never too late to start something new. I know that. Some old wrecks are just way too damaged to be fixed. Whoa! Look at the paint on this one! Oh, and my God look at the body line. This thing is straight as an arrow. The rims are vintage. My gosh, I'm sorry, Ma'am. Oh my God, it's you. Oh! You know each other? - This so-called mechanic? Yes. - It wasn't my fault! Admit you put my car together wrong. A bad driver can wreck any car. He'll never admit it. I can put a car like that together in one day with my eyes closed. So the issue lies with you. Why don't you prove it, then? But how about this time you do it right? All right. I will, then. Are you going to compete in that, uh, retro race of yours? I can still sign up. Okay, it's a bet. - Yes. - You won't win anyways. I will if the car you give me works this time. - We'll see. - I guess we will. That's great. APPLAUSE! Now, this is where the fun really begins. In a short moment, the jurors will announce who has qualified for the quarterfinals. Number... it's number 20. Number 45! Though I have my doubts that 45 will have any new surprises for us in the next round. Next up, it's number 17! And 32! With his completely mediocre performance. Hey, now wait a minute. Why are you being so mean? Stop recording! Hold on, hold on. Wait! What is this? They're just kids. They'll take this personal. Take what personally? Don't worry about this, she's just being hysterical. I was told I'd have a say in how this show operates, and that's why I agreed to do it. But who exactly is this woman? Who is she to tell us what we can and can't do? Hold on. You better listen to this woman. The board really wanted her to be a part of this show, but you, not so much. All right. Relax, relax. I'm the producer of this show, isn't that correct? Yeah, but do you need to insult these children on national television? Okay, okay. I'll make no more comments, okay? Are you happy? And call the children by their names, not their numbers. Okay. So is everything cleared up, then? Can we get back to work? - We can continue. - Fantastic! Hey, babe! Oh gosh, I'm starving. Do we have anything to eat? Wait, what? Didn't you say you were going shopping? All right. You're done with the sofa. Come here. But I really like it. What are you doing? Wait. Hey! Hey! What are you doing, huh? I like you too much to just stand by and watch you stare at the wall all day. Actually, I was staring at cars. Awesome. So are you gonna sit around at home every day from now on? Have you even looked for a job? Stefan, please pull yourself together! I knew this job was gonna change you somewhat, but this much? I was joking! - What is your problem? - You know what? If you like your sofa so much, then you can sleep on it tonight. Good night. Stupid. Just a second, just a second. I'll find something for you to do. Yeah. I hate sitting around with nothing to do too. I'm a man of action. Wow. You really could've fooled me, Wiesław. Come on. I'll get you some clothes. Jeez, are you okay? - Good morning. - Are you surprised? Well, if I'm being honest, I thought you were chicken out of our bet. And vice versa, which is why I came to check up on you. And I see you haven't even started yet. It's because... it's because I haven't found the right parts yet, and... If I may... Um, hello there. Well, hello there. As someone who was witness to the bet, I'd like to suggest that you put your car at stake. - The very same care that you... - Aleksandra. Enzo. ...that you started in that, uh, that ill-fated race, if that's still possible. Oh yes, it is. Very possible. Very good idea. So then you, uh, know where to find me when you're all done. See you. Goodbye. Have a nice day! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Boss, if I were you I'd just ask her out and smooth things over on a date. Wouldn't that be easier? Why don't you get back to work and smooth things out with that paint job back there since you're a man of action? Tell me why I still work here. What is it? I can see you keep breeding those nasty, obnoxious birds. Gallus gallus domesticus, if you please. They are my babies. Well, this is it under the tarp. I couldn't bring myself to get rid of it. Hmm. Oh my God! It's alive! You've gotta be kidding. I thought you like a challenge? Well, if you wanna back out, that's understandable. You'd want that, wouldn't you? It's fine. I'll start working on it this afternoon. Well, all right, then. What's the wait? - All yours. - Yeah, okay. - And good luck with it. - Mm-hmm. Now, she wants me to fix her chicken coop. Hi. Is everything okay? - What's your name, sweetie? - Klara. Mm, that's pretty. May I ask you, Klara... where are your parents right now? It's okay to cry if you feel like crying. You know, I cried just yesterday. Mm-hmm. 'Cause I had a fight with my boyfriend. Would you like to tell me what happened? That man back there told me my singing wasn't very good. - Which man? - That man onstage. - And you believed him? - Yeah. You do know that man has no idea how to sing, right? - He doesn't? - Mm-mm. What he thinks doesn't matter. - Would you like a hug? - Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Bring it in. Mm. Why don't we go talk to this man, okay? He will help you find your mom, okay? - Right? Okay, thanks. - Uh, Monika... Where are you going? Please state your name. Monika Grabarczyk. Are you participating in this competition? Because, if not, then... - What? You'll tell me I have no talent? - Do you? My talent is talking to children. That sucks. Come on. Don't you guys love it when I play the mean judge character? Oh do they? But isn't that why you're all here? Looks like someone didn't get the message. I know you think you can say whatever because they who won't fight back, but if I hear one more insult out of you, I'll make sure you're fired, understand? Are you familiar with anything having to do with cars or not? Sure, he is. He always posts about cars on social media. This screw right here, man, you gotta screw it in tightly or it'll all fall apart. Thank you. Should be thanking the boss. - Aleksandra. - Wiesiek! Bring me a wire brush... Best of luck. Hey. Oh, um, hi. How's it going? Is that what it's gonna look like? Yeah. Well, I like how it looks. It's kinda rough now, but I already found a new door. I ordered it, and it should be coming next week. Then I have to galvanize it, cover it with primer, and then paint it. This car will be as good as new, and you're lucky the engine's good. So what's your deal? Are you gonna keep showing up here just to see the progress? I guess I will if I have to. Mm-hmm? I need help. I'm trying to think of what to do about dinner. Oh! You know they just opened up an Italian restaurant next door? I don't wanna eat out. So you're... you're looking for food to be delivered to your house? No. I wanna cook it. You know, I think you could try making... Oh, actually no. Better not. Um, maybe call Ania. I bet she's got a great recipe. One that's really... easy to make. - You need a ride, Miss? - No, thanks. I'm fine. You sure you don't need a ride? - All right. Fine. Thanks. - Here you go. Hello? Plan B is in effect. Wait. This road doesn't go by my place. You're never supposed to say where you're going when you're a kidnapper. - I think you should tell me. - I wanna show you something. This better be quick. - Nope, won't. - What are you doing? - Should I go back? - Are you crazy? Maybe I am a little bit, but there's something I'd like to show you that I think you'll really enjoy. Well? Fine! Just go, then! Can you give me your phone, mine's dead. I have to let Stefan know where I am. Of course. RAFAŁ CALLING If you smash the garlic first, it'll be easier to peel. - Is that true? - Mm-hmm. Okay... What, are you recording me? Mm-hmm. Hey, this is your favorite ex-celebrity Enzo! Today, instead of driving one of my many luxury cars, I'll be taking you on a culinary journey to Italy. Lately, I've been trying many things for the first time, but I feel that cooking is in my blood... Ouch! There's someone who really wants to meet you. I actually promised them that I wouldn't tell you, but... - There she is! - Hello. Hello. Zosia said that you wouldn't come, and I knew you would come because you're the coolest person in the world. Well, Mr. Wiśniewski brought me. You're prettier than the last lady who came. Wait. Hey... Well, he's just talking about Child Services. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Will you play with us? Uh, sorry, guys. I'm not sure if we have enough time to, but, uh... - Oh, come on! - Please! Okay, okay. Well, since you ask so nicely, let's play tag, so run! Boom! So you said you had a reason for bringing me here. Yeah, um, I was actually raised here. And I owe a lot to this place, so I try to help the kids in any way I can. Those kids are obsessed with you. I forgive you for kidnapping me. But you could've told me where we were going. Well see, then you wouldn't have come along. Now you'll never know if that's true. But I do think I would've come for them. And maybe for me as well? And if you'd ever like to take me here again, I wouldn't say no to that. Okay. It's a deal. - Oh, it's a deal, then. - Bring it in. Thanks. You won't believe where I was. Babe, I'm so sorry. I was supposed to be home two hours ago... You really called me from his phone, huh? Yeah, um, my phone was dying, so I used Rafał's phone to let you know where I was. And then he drove you back here? I saw you made dinner. I shouldn't have. No. I'd really love to try it. It's probably cold by now. You could've told me you prefer spending time without me. - You know that's not true. - It isn't? I was in-studio. We just ran long today. I've seen how much this job has changed you, Monika. And being without a job has changed you just as much. Wiesiek, could you grab me the light. Hello. Not that light, a flashlight, you... Hi there. Hello. Well, you know what? I think it's coming along. Well... ...for starters, I put in the gaskets, now I'm just waiting on the fender, which is supposed to be delivered today. As for the rest, we'll just have to install the wipers and a few smaller details. We'll wash it and wax it and then we're all finished. It's gonna be ready on time. Promise you. Did you know I used to be a rally driver? I had to stop after I had Damian, of course. And years later I signed up to be a member of the retro car club. And why did you? It felt like my life was at a stopping point. My son lives in the States. He comes here every once in a while, but mostly to try and convince me to go live with him. I'm on my own here. I guess I just wanna feel the excitement again. Usually, club members choose their own cars for the show. It's not a real race, but I'd like for my car to make it to the finish line. Back then I was determined to make this car win, but everyone kept calling it a pile of junk. It wasn't your fault. You did a great job. I'm the one to blame. To this day, the club still won't let me forget it. Don't worry. This time will be a different story. Do you think this time me and the car will win? I wouldn't go that far, but you'll cross the finish line. You really can be so terrible. You know, I was thinking maybe in a couple hours you two would like to chat over dinner at a nearby restaurant. I'd like that. Wouldn't you? Oh. Hmm? Could you do tomorrow at 9:00? Yes. Well, great. It's a date, then. All right. I have to go. Have a nice one. I don't expect you to thank me, Boss. Wiesiek... Yeah, I know. I didn't forget about the flashlight. What's going on here? We're doing a first-aid course. It's being graded? - Yes, of course. - Okay. Kazik, where have you been? I've been looking everywhere. But Miss Monika wanted me to help her out here. But Miss Monika, why are these students outside during class? Because it's fun. "Because it's fun," huh? Jeez, you never stop surprising me, do you? I'm taking Kazik. This is important. Come on. - Come back when you're done! - Mm-hmm. Hello, and welcome everyone to The New Life of Old Cars. - That's a good name. - Well, that's just a working title. This blue beauty here used to rule the road, until it was destroyed in a race and was transformed into a chicken coop. But now, in the hands of our Maestro, it's being rebuilt with bigger and better parts, and new pieces are being implemented to completely eliminate rust. You can't paint over the rust? Actually, you can't just cover up the rust with paint. No, no, no. Anyways, once that's done, you put everything back together, order new windows, fill in the gaps, paint it all, heat it directly in the paint chamber and... good as new! Uh, that's somewhat accurate. What you see in front of you... is a true work of art. That should be good. You know, I would actually watch a show like that if it existed and I owned a TV. Why do you keep bending your hand like that? That's how you play. That's not cool. Play like Jimi Hendrix. Jimi Hendrix played with his teeth. Watch. With his teeth! Get it now? Here. You need to put more emotion into it. NEW TV SHOW PROPOSAL WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS? Good morning. Good morning. So what were you doing all night? I was busy working. Hmm. - So you were working? - Yeah. On what? Uh, can't spoil the surprise. - You'll just have to wait and see. - Whoo! - Are you free tonight? - Hmm. I can be. Well, how does this sound to you? Dinner, the second attempt. You know, I've got a good feeling about today. THANK YOU. IT MEANT A LOT TO THEM. TO ME AS WELL. Get the children in a wide shot, show how many of them there are, then focus on the main jurors, and, of course, get a shot of our lovely Monika. Uh, he's talking about the... Sir, don't you think it would be a good idea to focus more on the children? This isn't a debate. We've got a script, and we're sticking to that script. But this show is about the children, it's not about us. Wouldn't it be a good idea to film some interviews with the contestants? The children would get a big kick out of it. We're going to stick to the script, okay? We're not going to make everyone stay late just to shoot interviews with all those children. No one's getting paid overtime. Well, I can stay. Uh, yeah, I'll stay. Yeah, I don't have any place to be tonight. Well, in that case, I hope you'll stay too. Of course, I will. As long as it takes. - We can do test drives! - Yeah! We'll search for some really cool, old, vintage retro cars. I'm busy. Can't you tell me all this over the phone? - Okay. - Okay. And we can have guests. But not stupid celebrities, I'm talking car experts. - Enzo! - Jacek! - Oh my God! - What do you think? Sound like a hit? - You really love this idea. - Yeah! I'll cut to the chase. I talked to the execs. They all said the same thing. You know what they said? - Concept? Ingenious. - Yes! - Your video? Fantastic. - Yes! - Yes, but their problem is with you, Enzo. - Uh-huh. Well, they don't want you in it. - You said this would die down. - Yeah, I did. - I did... I did say that, Enzo. - Yeah? But you know what? I think I was wrong. I guess your career is done, buddy. I'm really sorry, but keep your head up. I'll make some calls, we'll go from there, okay? Hello? Hello. Yeah. Thanks for calling me back. I need to talk to you. What do you mean "done"? Mmm. Could you pass me a napkin, please? - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Don't worry. It's fine. - Here you go. - Thanks so much. I've been getting so clumsy recently. Yeah, I noticed. But it doesn't... Just don't think that it affects my work 'cause it doesn't. Your car will be ready on time, I promise. So, it's just about the car? No. I can fix it. And... and I can fix it much better than I did the first time, I promise that. I stopped caring about that car long ago. I mean... I mean, I obviously wanted you to fix my car, but I was hoping that maybe that fixed car would help fix me. That maybe we could help each other. Um... Well, I think I, uh... I think I'm gonna go 'cause I took the keys with me, now Wiesiek can't close up the garage. Are you afraid to give this a try? Yeah. I have to go. Look, I'm afraid too. You're right. You're right. I've noticed that you... you're afraid to get back behind the wheel. You're afraid of driving, aren't you? - Listen... - No. Listen to me. You know, if you don't, uh... if you don't work through that fear. If you just don't... Well, if you don't stop being afraid, even the best car won't help you cross the finish line. What are you afraid of? Well, me? Uh... I have found that not every car is built to be fixed. Okay. Well, you know what? I may be afraid to drive, but you're afraid to live. This is Enzo. I'm probably doing something super-dope right now, so leave a message... Excuse me, could we go a little faster? A little faster? You realize there's a speed limit? This is Enzo. I'm probably doing something super-dope right now, so leave a message and I'll get back to you... Stefan? THANKS FOR SPENDING THE EVENING WITH ME Uncle Stefan. I don't get why you couldn't just wait for her to come back. I waited for her last time. Are you enjoying it? This... this is really quite good. But next time maybe you could add a little more pepper and a lot less garlic. Couldn't you just talk to her and explain everything that's on your mind? Sure, I'll talk to her, but tonight I'm sleeping here, okay? THE SHOWMAN AND MODEL'S HOT LOVE AFFAIR Excuse me. Are you looking for Monika Grabarczyk? I bet she's with Rafał. Those two are inseparable. - What do you mean? - Well, it's true. He used to treat me like I was something special. I am special. But then she came along and he dropped me. Those two are always together. The other day, he even brought her a bouquet of roses. They really seem into each other, honestly. I mean... Shit! I shouldn't have told you that. You didn't hear any of that from me, please, okay? Fuck, she's gonna kill me. I can see you're working hard. It's no wonder why you've shown no interest in me lately. - Stefan, Rafał was... - Do you really wanna do this? Are you serious? Last month you said you're done with your TV career, but it seems like someone managed to convince you to stay. So have you just been moping around the house all day because you're jealous? Looks like I got a good reason to be. Yeah? Huh? Huh? Huh? See this? Monika, come on. I had no idea this was an issue. Stefan, you're overreacting. You were with him the night I made dinner for you? Jeez, Stefan, get it together. I still love you. I'll believe it when I see it. 'Cause what I see is that you'd rather be here with him than with me. - I won't ruin it. - That's rich, coming from you. You didn't have a problem ruining relationships when you slept with my fiancée. Hold on, when was it? It was March 22nd... My birthday, I remember! You don't know what you're talking about! Why do you even assume she cheated on you with me? Because that's your style. He got his career by sleeping around. Everyone knows Alicja gave him his career. And now what? His career is gone? So he's trying to find a new sugar mama. - Shut up! - Stop it! - Back up! - Hey! Both of you, stop it! - Hey! - Hey! I wasn't gonna step in but the audience is coming soon. Come with me. Monika? ISSUES DEPRESSION PREVENTION MONTH Andrzej? You won't believe this, uh... Now that I think about it, are you home right now? Stefan? No, it's me. - Oh hi, Dad. - Hey. I was in the neighborhood and I thought I would stop by and drop off that... that cake tin you lent me. Uh, where is it? - Where's what? - The cake tin. Oh, see. I... I forgot it. Dad, did you and mom fight a lot? Why? Is something wrong? No, it's... Then where's Stefan? Stefan moved out. We fight all the time and we can't agree on anything. I don't know what to do, Dad. I'm not really the best person to be giving relationship advice. Are you okay? You see, when your mom was alive, I was completely convinced that she was my soulmate, and that I couldn't possibly love anyone else but her, and... and now... Ola, I mean Aleksandra... I just really like her. Damn it, Monika. I even think I love her. That is awesome, Dad. That's awesome. What are you watching? Nothing. So you're just gonna lie there and do nothing? Don't you have anything to do? - Actually, I don't. - What about your TV show, then? It's not gonna happen. - Why is that? - How many questions will you ask? It's only my fourth one, and I think you're giving up. I've been watching this really cool video on YouTube... Just give it a rest already! They were able to scientifically prove that being completely honest with yourself is actually freeing. Do you even know what freeing means? Come on. Start doing something 'cause right now you're just making excuses. - Excuses? - Why don't you do something about it? I don't want to talk to her right now. About the show, dummy. You can do it on your own. Nobody watches TV anymore. Everything's online. Check it out. Welcome, everyone, to The New Life of Old Cars. - Move. - This blue beauty... Wow. You did this yourself? I did. Well done. Artem, your drawing is really nice. Thanks, Miss Monika. What is it? It's a house that mice live in. Mice, really? And do you like mice? Yeah. I think they're so cool. Monika, there's someone for you outside. - Go. - Stefan? I... I can keep an eye on everything here. Please say yes. Please! Zosia, Miss Monika doesn't even know what this is all about. - If this is about the show, then... - It's not. No, um... Are you free this afternoon? Because Zosia and I have plans, and we'd really like it if you joined us. I got you! Oh! Oh! Ooh! Come on. Let's go take a break. Kids, let's take a break. It's so great that you rented the ship for the kids. I also did it for you, you know? Hmm? Champagne? Around all these children? No. Now that you mention it, who put... Wait. I mean, how did this get in my... What am I doing? This is completely irresponsible! I just wanted us to have a little bit of privacy. - Well, the journalists won't find us here. - I wasn't talking about the journalists. I just wanted to spend time together away from everything. Hmm. Where I can't escape. Well, no. If you're a strong swimmer, then the Vistula shouldn't be much of a problem. Come on now. Am I really that stubborn? - Honestly? - Mm-hmm. Super stubborn. I guess for all the right reasons. I've never met anyone like that. I guess that's a good thing. 'Cause if you had to rent a boat for every friend you wanted to talk to privately... But I don't see you as a friend. 'Cause I wanted to... tell you that I really... Uh... It's really nice. With the river flowing. I guess it is. Get it together, pull yourself together What the hell are you doing? Monika! Excuse me. Oh. That's easy for you to say. Yeah, I did just like you told me to. I took her to the orphanage. I thought it'd work too, but she didn't respond like the others. Yeah, yeah, we got our pictures taken. I just got a little carried away. All right. Fine. I'll take care of it tomorrow. I'll just buy her flowers or something. Uh... Hey! Wait a second! Monika, it... it's just PR, okay? It was just a couple of photos. Maybe for you. I'm genuinely very glad you came here today. Rafał, just stop talking. Hey, hey, hey. What's the matter? I'm telling you the truth. What I heard was the truth. What, do you think you're more important than everyone? You think you're helping those kids? You think you'll save the world? Well, you won't. This entire world is completely rigged. What are you talking about? You're not gonna change anything. Listen, even our talent show has been rigged from the very beginning. Most of those kids don't need to show up 'cause we know who's gonna win. You need to understand this. Monika, you can't help everyone. And you can't fool everyone. Thanks for coming on such a short notice. Anything for a client. Listen, you gotta help me get out of this show. I won't take part in it any longer. Why? What happened? Everything has been rigged from the very beginning. Those kids trusted me. How can I watch them get eliminated unfairly? Hold on. You can't resign right before the grand finale. You signed a contract. You know what'll happen if you back out? My ass is on the line. What am I supposed to do, then? What you signed up for. Just one more episode. I mean, you wanna tell me what's the big deal again? I really thought the show was all about the kids and their talents. Ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to this year's retro car show, the meeting place for vintage automobile lovers. Now, you know what to expect. A rally with the most beautiful vehicles of the last century. Feel free to join in! You're not gonna want to miss this, folks! Hey. Ola. Look, I'll understand if you say no, and I'm not sure if I've earned it, but would you mind if I ride with you in this show? I mean, and the next one too? And then a few more after that? Hmm. Aren't you afraid of getting in the car with me driving? Yeah, I'm terrified. But what scares me more is the idea of you rejecting me. You are the worst. Crazy. Ola, my dear, I'm not afraid. And you... you won't have to be afraid anymore either. Okay. I'll be there in a minute. Just wait for me by the entrance. Okay. Hey. What's up? I don't know where to start. Mm-hmm. Tough day today, huh? Let's go for a walk. Wanna talk about what's wrong? - Well, you promise you won't tell anyone? - Of course not. I really don't like playing guitar, especially in front of people. So then why'd you sign up for the talent show? Because the headmaster made me. That checks out. Okay. So, what do you like, then? I like math a lot. But the headmaster said, he told me that mathematics are too boring and over-raisin... - Uh, over-rain... - He said it was overrated. Yeah, he said overrated. And not camera-friendly. And that mathematics won't win a talent show. And what do you think? I don't really care about the show. - Mm-hmm. - Is that bad? No, it's great. If you don't wanna play the guitar, then, honestly, you don't have to. - You sure about that? - Of course. But I don't want you to lie to anyone. And especially yourself. I'm so, so glad being on TV didn't turn you bad. You're a sweetheart. So are we going back to class? Come on, let's run back! Give me your hand. Whoo-hoo! Let's make it inside in ten seconds! And this here is number 23. Let's get this on the way. What a beautiful... And look at this one. Just a beautiful light blue. It is just as enjoyable... What's your number? Number 11. True affection like theirs is so genuine. Nothing like the ones in your magazines. What are you talking about? You seriously don't know? Everything is either made up or exaggerated. Nothing really sells like a down-to-earth romance. I'm still not following you. But you're the one in show business, man. I mean, at least you were. You still need me to explain this simple thing to you? You said the car was ready to race. - It was... It needs a good driver. - But? All right, Mr. Know-It-All, what's wrong with my driving? You overheated the engine. You said this car was ready. I'm not a mechanic. How should I know if... Hello? What? Why do you need me at the garage? Yeah, okay. I'm coming. I'm here! Dad, you here? Hey, Dad. Where are you? What are you doing here? Was this your idea, then? Ania wanted me to come here. - That's nice. - And why do you have a problem with that? I don't know what's gotten into you lately. I don't know. Maybe I'm a little jealous. Maybe I'm afraid you'll choose someone like how I used to be. Look, honey... I'm still in love with you. All those tabloid photos are fake. It was... it was all just a big set up. Then why did you agree to that? I didn't agree to any of that. I had no idea. The whole damn show is rigged. Wait, what? Tomorrow is the grand finale, and the winner was chosen from the start. And I can't do anything about it. There's always something you can do. The finale's tomorrow, right? I've really missed you. Okay, okay. I'll take care of that. Tomek! Great, great. I gotta run, bye. Coming! Kazik! Kazik! Excuse me. Have you seen a small boy with a guitar? His name's Kazik. I haven't. But if he's not here, we'll have to find another kid. No, I'll go find him. Can I borrow this? - Have you checked level minus two? - No. Where? - There. - Kazik! All right! We're live in five! Kazik! I'm sorry, it's just... there's a lot of pressure tonight, isn't there? The cameras are off, you don't have to pretend to be nice. - Ready? - Mm-hmm. This is our last show. Get ready! Three... Welcome back here to Dream Academy! I hope you're ready for our grand finale! We're joined live by ten million viewers. We welcome you! The finalists have been selected by our dear viewers. Did the viewers really choose, though? Well, don't the viewers always choose? As I was saying, the very best of the very best will now compete for... "The very best," huh? Is being the best really so important? Especially for young children? You see, we tend to choose our show hosts based on their sense of humor. Please join me in welcoming our next guest... Uh, these are our finalists. This way to the stage? Come on, come on. If this behavior doesn't cease, then just cut her mic and keep them both at a wide-shot. I'm sorry, are you listening to me? I said cut her mic! Wide shot, cue music, and go to commercial. Okay, okay, okay. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Just relax, gentlemen. I mean you no harm. Cut to commercials right now! Did you hear what I said? - It's time to welcome back our finalists. - Wait, Krzysztof. Tonight's gonna be a hit. ...to choose which one of them will be the first Dream Academy winner! And here they are now! Um... Is it really fair to measure talent? See what she's doing? Does that make it fair to take away a child's dreams? Honesty sells. Is it fair to label these children as losers? Well, it's not on this show. On this show, every child who had the courage to stand on this stage is a winner. Okay. I'm going to need you to step away from the trailer. - We're staying with it. - Hmm. And now let's welcome back to the stage Basia, Czarek, Klaudia, Weronika, Antoś, and Maurycy, and everyone else! Kazik! Kazik! This is every single contestant we've had since the first round. They did a great job, and have made millions around the country very happy. Now let's give them a hand. Bravo, bravo! These children have really taught us that we should never stop chasing our dreams. Because our dreams are what's most important. And for that, we thank you. Thank you! Kazik! Hello? I can't believe you actually think this is about those kids. Everyone's in show business for fame and money. You're just pretending you're a saint. Why did you manipulate those children from the orphanage into working for you? Was that for your public image? Or to save the viewership of your show and make more money? You can't do anything about it. You think the press will believe you? You cannot prove anything. But I can. Hey! Smile for the camera, Rafał. Thank you so much, Rafał. That was very brave. Thank you for being so honest with everyone. Let's all give one last applause for Rafał Wiśniewski, his career, and his last TV appearance, as well as his decision to donate his entire salary to his favorite orphanage. Bravo! So thank you, Rafał. And just like him, I'll be doing exactly the same. Yes, of course. Excuse me. Let's play! Oh my gosh. Will you stay with me forever, Monika? Mm-hmm. But wait, do you have the ring?
