How's it looking? Signal's getting strength. Looks like she's homing in. What are we gonna do with Iris One after we win the war on drugs? It's a highly versatile system, I'm sure it'll be put to good use. Now, let's not get ahead of ourselves here, gentlemen. Never underestimate my boys, Ross. I guarantee you. Delta will give Salvatore a blow he'll not soon forget. Either that... or they'll end up like the two DEA teams before them, Norm. What are you talking about, Alan? Well, ask Jensen there. He oversaw the ops. Is it true? Why was I not made aware of it? A decision was made to deny any knowledge. Cut the disclaimer horseshit, Jensen! Is it true what Alan was saying? Two teams? 12 men each. So you're telling me that 24 men have died attempting the same mission? I'm afraid so. Captain, I just wanna say I think we got no business... Hutch! Not now! She's homing in. Bingo. Tell the guys we got a 909er. Ability base, this is river rat. We've got a confirmed target lock. Repeat. Confirmed target lock. Americanos! Captain, talk to me! Get us to the other side! Vengas! Rapido! Nobility Base, we're ground zero and closing on target. Where the hell they all go? Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on! Come on! Come on! Clear! Move out! Move up! Hell of a party, fellas? We like it, Cap! Lombi, take point! Lombi, take point. Right, Cap! Lombi! Say "happy." Happy. Lombi! Say "birthday." Right, Cap. Let's do it. It's time to rock and roll! Watch your step, Doc. Don't worry about me. Just keep your eyes open. Clear. Pretty clean, Cap. Guess Salvatore never figured anyone would make it this far. What? Shit. Lombardi, move! Move! Move! Move! Fuck! Cap! Shit! Lombardi! Lombi's down, Cap. Okay. Move! Move! Move! Move! Go! Go! This is not good, Cap. This is not good. Give all you got, Doc. Come on, baby. You give me all you got, Doc. I want all you got! Clear! Clear! Go! You gotta stay with me. You gotta stay with me, okay? Stay with me. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Clear. Pay dirt. Man, this is a cokehead's wet dream. Not for long, it ain't. Hutch, why's it so damn quiet out there? Nothing left to kill, Captain. Job well done. Stay with me, okay? Talk to me. You're gonna talk to me. Let's talk about Becky, okay? Talk to me about Becky. Stay with me. You gotta talk to me. Skip! Nice toss, Cap. Come on, Mac, set the timer. Let's get the hell out of here! Come on, fucker! Let's get out of here. Let's go! Americans? Sí. Do they know who they're dealing with here? Because, I mean, this is... you know? This is a fucking insult, man. They insult me! They insult my family! Find out how they knew and find out now! Sí. One comma 8 billion. Stupid fucks! Who the fuck do they think they're dealing with? You just got yourselves a war! The world has been led to speculate on the details of the raid which reportedly destroyed a stockpile of cocaine with an estimated street value of $1.6 billion. It's rumored, however, that President Farrington will address the issue in his keynote speech at the U.N. later this week. In other news... War on drugs. Right. What a fucking joke. What's the problem, Hutch? Captain, this is not our fight. When have we ever been able to pick our own fights? Come on, Cap! War on drugs? We are just pissing in the wind. That's what burns me. What you talking about, Mac? He's talking about Lombardi in there, fighting for his life. Why? Why? For what? Because some fat-ass bureaucrat decided that fighting drugs is the fucking flavor of the goddamn month! You wanna know what the bottom line is? That until you start writing the checks or calling the shots, you're under complete and total obligation to follow orders, period! I'm sorry, gentlemen. There's been no change. Me? I don't know shit about satellites. But I got someone who does. I'm known as a hacker. I'm wanted by the FBI, the CIA, Interpol, Mossad, the Russians, the French, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Wanted for what? Cyber theft. I steal codes. Burgle information. You know, all with Mable's help, of course. Welcome to the Nineties, my technologically challenged friends! The world is computerized... and it's all at my fingertips. Stocks, bonds, utilities, insurances, communication, even the military. If it's networked, it's accessible. With a few exceptions, of course. Once I'm in, people like Sal pay me to observe, to manipulate, to sabotage. Now, a couple days ago, Sal came to me with this problem of yours. And here it is in all its glory. The Iris One constellation. Say hello to the American navy's finest, gents. The U.S.S. Roosevelt, the first in a brand-spanking-new class of ultra-quiet attack subs. Ultra-quiet attack subs. Why are you showing us this? What do the subs have to do with satellites? Chill! I was getting to that. You see, the Navy talks to its subs via another satellite network known as the SSIX. Mable and I have cracked the SSIX, gents, which means I can talk to the subs. Start sending a message. Z08375... from com sub... to U.S.S Roosevelt... one... emergency test... low... system.. Mr. Wallcox. Sir. A possible defect in workmanship of the valves in the emergency system? "Please test the system immediately and report any anomalies." That's what it says, Mr. Wallcox, so I suggest we get to it. And if there is a problem, don't you think it would be better to know sooner than later? Okay, flood the tanks so we can get on with this. Captain. Yes, sir. Standby to flood the tanks! All hands, this is the Captain. We've been ordered to perform an emergency blow drill, to test for a possible defect of the system. Batten the hatches, men. We're taking the express elevator to the roof. The drill will commence when all sections are reported in. Captain out. Surface preparation! Prepare to surface! Prepare to surface! Come on! Come on! You're behind on your drill! Let's go! Come on! Chemical clear. Sub is secure. Forward-weapons hatch open. Sal, you got yourself a sub. How long before the equipment's up and running? 8 hours, more or less, if the guys know what they're doing. They know how. Believe me, they know. How many hours overdue\is the transmission? 24. Theories? Well, she wend down. She was torpedoed. If she's on the bottom, it'll take weeks to find her. For God sakes, we're not at war! At least not yet. Lombardi's dead. Cap called. He died half an hour ago. Jesus, Paul. I'm so sorry. I told him to go. We were at the top of these stairs... and I told him to go first. And then I saw the laser tap him, and I told him to move... and he fucking froze. I told him to fucking move, and he froze. Honey, you did everything you could. This wasn't your fault. Maybe Mac's right. Maybe this isn't our war. But right now, you know what I want? I want him dead. I don't care if they legalize drugs or they don't. I want Humberto Salvatore dead. God, it's Frank. What the hell? This is Humberto Salvatore using live pictures from the U.S.S. Roosevelt. Surely you've been wondering what happened to the sub. Well, wonder no more. It's mine. Get me a VPA now! If it is him, he's got to be bluffing. Then how in hell did he know the sub's gone missing? He's got to be staging this somehow. It's just not possible. My men have already replaced the conventional warheads on the sub's cruise missiles with warheads containing mustard gas. I have the ability to strike at any four cities on the eastern seaboard from the sub's current position. My people tell me that you can push a button that will destroy your eyes in the sky, Iris One. I give you 24 hours to push that button, or I'll push mine. Your only choice is to decide what you lose... A few satellites or millions of innocent lives. You wanted a war. You got one. I'll be in touch. Come on. He's got to be bluffing about that. Would you take a chance on that, Ted? Would you? If we nuke it, it won't matter whether or not he's bluffing. If he's on the open sea, sure. But what if he's parked 25 miles off the coast of D.C.? Okay, what have we got here? We've got the quietest sub in the world poised to strike the eastern seaboard with chemical weapons. What I want to know is, what the hell are we gonna do about it? Skip Lang. Skip. Norm Henshaw here. If you and the boys are up for another crack at Salvatore, we've got a real situation here. We've decided to strike directly at him. Unfortunately there's no time to mobilize and deploy a large force. Naturally, your unit was at the top of the list. No, I will be honored to cooperate in every way posible, Señor, sí. And I give you my personal guarantee that everything will go smoothly, sir. The President is very, very grateful personally, and buenas noches. Thank you. Good-bye. Borrega assures me everything will be in place for Operation Trap by the time Delta arrives. Norm, this is my protégé, Ariana Decker. She helped me design and install the safeguards for the Iris One network. She also had a hand in the computer enhancements on the Roosevelt. Captain, too bad you weren't around to help with the SSIX. Well, we're pretty sure we know who Salvatore's point man was on that. Here, let me show you. Sure. All right, gentlemen. It's time we get down to business. As you know, Salvatore's grubby fingers reach into every nook and cranny of the Colombian military. So open communication to base is out of the question. Out of the question! I know it's contrary to standard procedure, but that's the way that this op's going down. Any questions? Where are we staging from? It's a small town called St. Crystal. We'll ride a train in across the tracks into his territory. Slip up under his nose. Kick him in the fucking teeth. I love that. Two. Three. Kilo, kilo, alpha, 9-1-4. Three, kilo, kilo, alpha, 9-1-4. Completed one. All automation systems normal. Bearing, 072. Range, 44,000. Automated systems responding accordingly. Turning. Okay, gentlemen. There are two phases to this op. Phase one. Infiltrate the compound, locate the target. Phase two. Capture and/or eliminate the target. This will be our optimal L.C. here. As we cross the border, it will be our secondary. Any questions? Captain. We're approximately six minutes away from the border. Let's synchronize our watches to 0700 hours in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Hey, hombres. Venga. Vayanse! Vayanse! Rapido! Vamamos. Rapido! Rapido! Vamos. Andele. Rapido. This is General Borrega. Do you wish to purchase any information? Yes. You sound like a smart man, Admiral. Everybody makes a mistake from time to time. That is human nature. And yours was wasting your time planning a strike against me when you could have put that time to better use convincing your President to destroy Iris One. Speaking of time, Admiral, it's ticking away. You have eight hours to get President Farrington to pull the plug on Iris One. Borrega. I'd say we're looking up a dead horse's rectum, Norm. Yeah. Cap, we got to get this train moving, man. Go, go, go! Beggars, go airborne! One in the hole. Hutch, Vicks, juice up the birds. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Battery on. Battery on. Come on, Cap! You get back here, goddamn it, Sparks! That's an order! Circuit breakers on. Phase two, circuit breakers on. Shit! Fuel pump, check. Fuel pump, check. Adonde? Adonde? Where are they? Son of a bitch! Hydraulics engaged. Shit! Let there be light. Son of a bitch! Aw, shit! Sparks is hit! Sparks! We'll come get you in five. It's coming around 1:00 high. Got you covered. Go, go, go! Move it! Take it up! Going up. Tango. Tango. Son of a bitch! Hurry, Cap! Incoming! We're coming! We're coming! Come on! Get on! Go! We're gonna land the thing over here. Let's go. Good work, guys. That's definitely one for the record books. I think it's time we go rain on Salvatore's parade. Come to Thane. He loves you, baby. Thane loves you. Yeah. So, General Borrega, tell me about the train. So where are they now? Jesus Christ! Hurry up! Get Thane. Thane! Hallway clear! Hello, Howie. You got me mixed up with someone else, man. Over here, Cap. What is it? Hutch, Vickers, download this punk. Mac, Doc, come with me. What the hell's he doing down here? Shit! The current! Son of a bitch is headed toward the river. Hi, Howie. I'm Hutch. That's Vickers. Hey. I only have one question. Where's the sub? Watch the material, bub. Hey. See, I know that you have a com link, so I know you're talking to the sub. How? Holy jeez. You guys just really don't... Don't make me ask you again. You idiots. Reload. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Howard! Look at me. Look at me. Are you gonna give me the answers I need? Or am I gonna have to convince you? Hold on. I really... I really don't know. I really don't... I can contact the hijackers, okay? Now we're getting somewhere. Get your ass over there and call 'em off. It won't help. They were only supposed to set up the equipment and take over. They're superfluous now. Don't you patronize me. What... do... you... mean? I designed the system to completely automate the sub. That's what Salvatore wanted. So what would happen if his demands were met? Fuck, I don't know! Fuck! And I liked him. Okay. Shit! I want you to tell me again. The SSIX. Only Salvatore knows the codes. Where is the Roosevelt headed? The hijackers were supposed to... We know that! He asked you where the Roosevelt was headed. Where's the sub? Cap! Cap! So fucking close! I take full responsibility for Salvatore's escape. At ease. What's up? We have a clear target, Captain. Where? The sub is headed for New York City. Shit! Is that true, Thane? Is that true? It's true. We're going airborne, gentlemen. Get this loser out of here. Sir. What the hell are you on? Captain, we cannot break radio silence. I have to break protocol, Mac. We have no choice. Captain, listen... It's a matter of national security! Track leader to Nobility Base. Track leader to Nobility Base. Do you read? Get up, goddamn it. Come on in, Skip. Let's hear it. Admiral Henshaw. We thwarted the ambush on the train without incident, but, Salvatore got away. Shit! However, we did grab Thane. Did you get the code? Negative. And, sir, it looks like the Roosevelt is headed to New York City. What? New York City? Okay, Skip, change of plan. Rendezvous ASAP on board the U.S.S. Coral Sea. I'll update the President. Nobility Base out. Good to have you back, dude. All over it, Cap. Morning, Admiral. Joe. Ten-Hut! Take it easy, boys. Carry on. Captain. Sir. So this is our infamous Mr. Howard Thane. Yes, sir. Howdy, Gramps. Um... I really need my medicine. He's talking about these, sir. We took 'em off him at the villa. Whatever they are, he's got a pretty strong habit going. Admiral. Do we have any news from the Roosevelt yet, sir? She's on a holding pattern up in New York Bay. And our course of action? Well, I've got to get you boys on board, don't I. You're wasting your time. Even if you get past those hijackers, you're never gonna override the program. Get that thing out of here! I want to talk to my lawyer! I still got rights, you know. I'm an American citizen for Christ's sake! Well, Captain, at least we stand a chance of finding the sub. And then what, sir? Look, I know Howard. Maybe I can talk to him. Maybe we should think about evacuation. Evacuating what, General? Just 'cause the submarine's heading for New York doesn't mean New York's the target. Hey, Howard. You're looking better than ever. Wish I could say the same. You said Salvatore's the only one who knows the code to remotely access your automation system. That's what I said. What about overriding it from inside the sub? What about it? Howard, don't be like that. Help me and I'll help you. How? If you cooperate I can fix it to where you're not wearing a tutu for some 300-pound murderer named Spike. You're gonna have to do better than that, Ariana. I look great in a tutu. I bet you do. Bet you'd like one of these right about now, wouldn't you, Howard. What would you do with it? Let it slowly dissolve on your tongue? No. Bet you'd chew it to a fine paste so it would get in your bloodstream a little faster. Like I said... you help me and I'll help you. Each major system has its own program. They can each be shut down individually. How? By entering the right codes. Can I please have my pills? What do you got yourself hooked on, Howard? Painkillers? Please. Choke on 'em, Howard. Very funny! Screw you too, you fucking bitch! They're never gonna mess with you assholes! Never trust a fucking woman! Especially one named Ariana. Excellent work, Ariana. Thank you, sir. I'd like you to meet Delta Team One. Hello. Captain, this is the unit that's gonna get you on board that submarine. What? Marcus, I'm really not ready for this. One of us has to go. The Navy may be building quieter and quieter submarines, but they're still not equipping them with wheelchair ramps. You're the best person for the job. You know that. DSRV bearing 2-4-0. Roger that. DSRV bearing 2-4-0. Turbulence factor, 18 degrees. Roger that. Turbulence factor, 18 degrees. Current, 30 degrees at 4 knots. Contact. Do we have contact? Negative on contact. Captain. My God, she's a beast. We have a hard seal. Admiral, we are locked on. Dree, check the escape hatch. Dree, report. Dree, report. Dree, report. They... They gassed 'em, Cap. H-8-M-2-6-9. Chemicals negative. Assume defensive series 8-3-5-L-Z. Come on. This ain't potpourri. Make sure there's no heat-sensors, booby traps, tripwire. Doc, I need you to link us up topside. Yes, sir. See anything, Hutch? Negative on explosive devices, Captain. You all right? Yeah. Nobility Base, do you copy? This is Team One. Over. Got anything for me, Doc? Nothing yet, Captain. Captain. One down. Mac. What the hell is this? That's good-bye, New York. In just under 30 minutes, President Farrington will stand before the leaders of the world and deliver the keynote speech for the 1998 drug summit. For days now, pundits have been predicting that the speech will serve as a platform for a major announcement. But as has been the case all week long, no one in the White House will even hint at what the announcement might be, although this morning a source promised that it would be, quote, history-making. Captain. What is it? None of the codes Thane gave us were accepted. What! Son of a bitch lied. No! I don't think he did. Salvatore's hijackers must have changed them. Let's just trash the freaking main-frame. No! I know how Thane works. I'm sure he's incorporated some safeguards to make this whole system sabotage-proof. We have 28 minutes, gentlemen. Mac, man the helm. Sir. Attempt a manual override. Doc, what do you have for me? Still got nothing. Got to do better than that. I need to speak with Henshaw immediately. Yes, sir. Cap? What's the problem? We got nothing. Hutch. Sir. Prepare the emergency blow system. Yes, sir. Everybody hold on. We're going topside. Brace yourself. Ready to fly in 3, 2, 1. Blow. Shit. Hutch? No response, Captain. Let's go again. Sir! Okay? In 3, 2, 1. Blow! She's wired! Damn it, why am I not surprised? Hutch, clear that passageway! Yes, sir! You okay? You all right? Nobility Base, this is Team One. Do you copy? Over. Come on. Nothing, Captain. Keep trying. Nobility Base, this is Team One. F1, shift. That will reboot the system. System's rebooting. We have a frequency. Nobility Base, do you copy? This is Team One. Over. Admiral, they've secured the cockpit. You're on speaker. This is Nobility Base, Captain. You've shut the system down. Negative, Admiral. The codes weren't accepted. The hijackers somehow transposed. Thane's emergency fail-safe sequence numbers. Captain. Can you at least tell which cities the missiles are targeting? Negative, sir. Ariana's trying to work on that program now. Prepare to fall-back contingency. Keep us posted. Nobility Base out. Hutch and Vickers, move to weapons lockers. See what you can do to disengage the firing mechanism. Mac and Doc. Take care of Ariana. Sir. Cool. Okay, baby, okay. Talk to me. The spheres... Son of a bitch, the spheres Vickers brought in, Cap, I knew I'd seen 'em before. In the Gulf. So it is biological. Yeah, sir. Which means it'll be an airborne virus and it'll be deadly. Can you guesstimate the area of contamination? Based on the size of that sphere, depending on how many there are, I mean, I'd say we're looking at Manhattan, minimum. That's 10 million people, Hutch. Dead people. What the hell is this? Cap, we got something. What do you got, Mac? Cap, it's right behind the sonar now. Son of a... Confirmed. Got a problem. Hutch we got two in the bush. You're flying solo on this one. Great. Vicks. Mine's down. Get down! Come on. Three down, Cap. Fail-safe. Fail-safe. Ho, ho, you are clever. You are... What is that? Sounds like the reactors are swelling up. We're accelerating. How the hell are we accelerating? There's no one driving this thing. It's the codes. Shit. Now we're turning. She's breaking our holding pattern. Maybe they got control of the helm. No, sir. She's headed towards the mouth of the East River. What the hell's going on in here, Mac? Heck if I know, Cap. Goddamn thing's driving itself. Sparks. Sir. Contact Henshaw. Yes, sir. Vicks. Sir. Scope up. Yes, sir. Nobility Base, this is Team One. Over. Roger, Admiral. You're on speaker to Captain Lang. This is Nobility Base, Captain. Have you got control of the helm? Negative, sir. At the moment we're belly-up and on a guided tour. You are heading up the East River. What? Vicks? Affirmative, sir. Son of a bitch. Salvatore's planning on making a statement at the international drug summit. What are you talking about, Captain? There's a biological bomb and three Tomahawk missiles on board, sir, all prepped and hot. They're headed for the U.N. Ladies and gentlemen, presidents, prime ministers, it is with the utmost pleasure that I stand before you today as the bearer of remarkable news, news of an historic turning point in the worldwide war on drugs. We got the helm. Vicks. Sir. Have we got enough water to turn this baby around? Yes, sir. Hard to port, sir. Hard to port! Eight hundred. Seven hundred. Six hundred and closing. I speak of a surveillance satellite network called Iris One... Come on, come on, turn. A network so sophisticated that it will enable us to pinpoint with great accuracy... Two hundred. She's starting to turn. Even the smallest amount of narcotics... One fifty. She's turning. As the recent raid on Humberto Salvatore... She's turning. Keep it hard. Keep it hard over. Hard over! Convincingly demonstrated. At 100. Hold on. Armed with this potent new weapon... We're clear, Captain! We're clear! Clear! Victory in the war against drugs is ours. Thank you, gentlemen. Now for the bomb. Give me good news, Hutch. We've got a tanker dead ahead. Can we avoid her? It'll be tight. Starboard! Starboard! Come on, baby. Starboard, Mac, starboard! Shit! Sons of bitches! Damn it! Goddamn it! Clear of the bridge. Cap... last phase is complete. I don't have the codes to access the trigger mechanism, Cap. I understand. Cap, you got to tell her. Tell her I need those codes. You tell her I need those codes! I understand. Ariana. Hutch said he can't disconnect the last phase until you give him the codes for this triggering mechanism. Cap, we got a problem. This clock has gone crazy. It's just jumped from 11 to 9. There's too many codes. The odds are against us! Come on, Ariana. You're better than that doped-up little turd. There's got to be something. Seven minutes. What the hell was that, Vicks? Bottom side, sir. Three minutes. Come on! Look, solider. We have done our job. You have got to get in this guy's head. You've got to think like Thane thinks. What motivates him? What makes him tick? Is it money, power, greed? The dope? What is it, goddamn it? What is it? Come on. It's me. Come on. A. R-I. N. A. It was you. Good work. Hey, Cap. Good God, Sergeant. Yeah. This sub, sir, she's breaking up. Vicks, I need a hand please. Nobility Base, Nobility Base, this is Team One. We have a slight dilemma, sir. Sub appears to be taking on a lot of water. We have, however, defused the biological bomb, but it appears we won't be able to contain her speed. She's runaway, sir. Admiral Henshaw, sir. Presently we are in possession of eight spheres of an airborne biological virus, sir. We have not had time to defuse the Tomahawks. Set your wheel to 3-5-3. Your priority is to get those chemicals off that vessel. Abandon ship. That is an order. You heard 'em, people. We're abandoning ship. Set the course for 3-5-3. Let's get the hell out of here. 3-5-3. Lock. 3-5-3, sir. Pick it up, people. We're running out of time. Jesus Christ! Let's just hope the DSRV's okay. Goddamn it. There's a major malfunction in the seal. What? The coupling's cracked. Must have happened when we scraped the bridge. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Hull damage. Mac, get the hell up here. We're flooding the tanks. Captain. Mac, that's an order! Get up here! Captain! What? The coupling's shot. We're not going anywhere. We're all gonna die. Unless what? Feed my cat, Cap. Mac! He jammed it. Whoa. You got to order him to get out now! Skippy! Finally I'm in. Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac! Mac. Mac. Mac. Get him on his side, Cap. Mac. Keep his head down and get him on his side. Mac. Come on, buddy. Keep your head down. Good job. Hey, soldier. What? No mouth to mouth?
