Digitally remastered with the support of presents And last but not least, the pride of our museum. Archeologists found it in the 18th century when exploring the ruins of a villa dating from Roman times. It's a statue of Demeter, the goddess of crops. It was made by a Greek sculptor in the 3rd century BC. She was named the Pagan Madonna because of her face and body. The statue was made of gold alloy. Its value cannot even be estimated. Excuse me, it's 7 o'clock, the museum must close. Thank you for your visit. Good-bye. THE PAGAN MADONNA Written from a short story by Directed by Director of photography Music Starring ls anybody there? What are you doing here? János Somos, the guard was found here. He was unconscious. He was only shot once. He was taken to hospital immediately and operated on but he is still unconscious. A candlestick was found beside him, with some hairs and bloodstains. It's in the lab. The guards head wasn't injured. Has anything been stolen? The Pagan Madonna. The window of the box was broken. The door was opened but the alarm didn't go off. Our technicians say it was the work of experts. The fuses are here behind this stone slab. To silence the alarm, you must turn off this switch. Here. It's turnecl off. Three fuses were missing from the panel. They controlled the lights. We replaced this one. The other one controlled the entrance alarm system, and this one the Pagan Madonna. It only takes that much to silence the alarm? No. You have to cut the safety circuits of the battery operated system, too, to avoid setting off the alarm signal. The entrance... and the Pagan Madonna. Cuckoo, come in please. This is Pigeon calling. Over. Cuckoo, come in please. This is Pigeon. Over. Cuckoo reporting to Pigeon. Over. The robbery required full knowledge of the place. It could've been an inside job. I've ordered the borders to be closed down - just to be on the safe side. - We must find them immediately. We mustn't give them time to hide the Madonna. I want you to find some clue, dr. Kardos. There will be something, I guess. And another thing. You're in charge of this case, but it would be wise to ask someone else to be in on it, too. I hope you know who I am talking about. Yes, but he is on leave. He'll bite my head off if I start bothering him. He was so anxious. I'm sure he could spare some time for you if necessary. Well, if it's necessary. I should make a phone call. You can do it in the office. The abbot is waiting for us. No...no... ls something the matter? No, no... My wife... Later. What was it you said? The abbot is waiting. Let's go then. We're waiting for the commander of this investigation. I'm in charge of this investigation. Not Ötvös? No. We've already met. We'd like to know where the members of the club were when the alarm was installed. Who could have known it, who could have had access to it. I can't give you an exact answer. But I can look it up in our files if you want me to. I'd be very grateful. Please tell lmre to come here. Will you have something to drink? No, thank you. I never do. Not the communion wine, of course. Something to eat then? I could do with a bite but only if it's convenient. Laudetur Jesus Christus. In aeternum amen. Kardos. I want to know who was not in the building last night. Take it easy. Everyone was at home. Did anyone come home later than usual? People don't stay out in this place. - May I leave now? - Yes, yes. Laudetur. Would you please instruct the cooks to make a few sandwiches? Right away, sir. Laudetur. Would you tell me how the reverend Somos is? Who? The guard. The operation is over but he is still unconscious. Excuse me, isn't there something that you can tell us? Something that you feel would help this investigation. Don't you have a hypothesis or some ideas? I'm sorry but I don't have any. I'm totally clueless. I have absolutely no idea. Thank you. Should my colleague be looking for me, I'll be in the museum. What about your sandwiches? This is the list of the members of the Physics Club. These people might have known the alarm system. - Check their alibis right away. - Headquarters cleared five of them. Ferenc Altmann, Budapest, no head wound, slept at home, no witnesses. Peter Kriván, Budapest, no head wound, slept at home, no witnesses. János Mórocz, Fonyód, no head wound, slept at home, no witnesses. Kálmán Pető, the same. Tamás Tímár, the same. No problem, but you must find the others right away. How many of them are there? 72. - How many? - 72. 18 of them are still working here. 11 left the order. The remaining 43 are scattered all over the country in various parishes. That's a lot. And the boss wants hot tracks. Excuse me for interrupting, but there's - something else that needs clarification. - What is it? Someone had to turn this system off. From inside. I don't think it was Somos because his injury is too bad. - Get to the point, Szemere. - The point is: where did the person... come from and how? Don't you dare come here. Turn back or I'll cut you to pieces. Back board! Attention. The finals. Star 6311... Now. 2 hours, 29 minutes and 30 seconds. Hurray. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations, Csöpi. Let me congratulate you. - Won't you give us something to drink? - Sure. Here. Drink. You'll have to fight harder in the next race. They weren't in the inside... Let's have a drink. What now? I thought you might help. You could come and have a look at the place and all that. Two heads are better than one. Let's go then. Congratulations. That was really nice. Thanks, buddy. Bye. Doc. - What's that? - A hot track. Skinny? I'm afraid, I don't quite understand the question. Well, yes. I'd like to know if there was a very slim or skinny person among the ones who could have known the alarm system. We'll ask professor Bárdos. Excuse me. I'm very sorry but I've never seen the Pagan Madonna. Could you give me a photograph of it? Of course. Lieutenant, how long must we keep the museum closed? People are already saying strange things. They exaggerate, which is bad enough. We'd stop the gossiping if we opened the museum again. I don't think you'll have to wait long. - Here you are. - Thank you. It's wonderful! Yes, it's very valuable. Well, I think I'd better go. Thank you for everything. Laudetur. And good health to you. Árpád Gyula Kocsis, still active as a priest, Zoltán Vályi, Szántód, left the order, Gábor Varga, Budapest, left the order... - Are those the skinny ones? - Yes. All right. Do you still need me? I don't think so. - Happy hunting. Bye. - Thanks. Goodbye. Check them as soon as possible. Szántód is straight across. I'll go there myself. You'll waste time waiting for the ferry. Csöpi! Why is he waving? It must be the mosquitoes. Hey, stop! Stop! Get them. That's first lieutenant Ötvös. Only a second lieutenant, Béla. Dear me, what have you done again, Csöpi? Just a little affair... Can I borrow your car for an hour? Of course. Go ahead, take it. I'm sorry. I forgot. - This is my colleague, Tibor Kardos. - Dr. Kardos. Oh, yes... Do you have new men again? Yes, Jancsi and Pista. They're on duty on the water. Tell them, next time we'll have a sign on our motor boat saying "secret police". Where are you going, Jani? They are stealing your car. Can't you see? They refuse to stop, they sail when it is forbidden... That big guy must be a real gangster. If he wasn't, he'd be a captain by now. But he is only a lieutenant. Good day. We're looking for Zoltán Vályi. Send him home if you find him. Excuse us, but we are the police. You? Show me your papers. Yours? I'm the driver because he can't drive. Could we come inside for a moment? Yes, why not? When did your husband leave? Yesterday afternoon. Where did he go? I don't know. How come? I work at the local bar. I went to work at 4 yesterday. I see. Did your husband leave after you'd gone? The pig told me he was not going anywhere. I came home for a minute at 8 p.m. but he was gone. I left him a message on the door but it was still there when I got home at 4 am. Does he usually stay out like this? Yes. And where does he usually go? He goes to the other side. To Tihany, Füred, to the disco and his women... Do you know the names of some of his friends there? Only their nicknames. That's good. Able, Briquette, Homework, Moustache... - And Cigar. - Thank you. That's enough for me. Just a minute! He'd like to ask you if he could have a look around, please? Even though he has no search warrant. What did my husband do, anyway? Do whatever you like. Perhaps with me? Madam. Did your husband take a car? Yes, he took his Wartburg. Color, license number? Dark green, UM 12-90. One last question. - Does he have a valid passport? - Yes. He got his tourist passport last month. Here. - Maybe this will tell you more. - Thank you very much. I hope you don't mind, but could I have a bite to eat? Some bread and butter with whatever you have. Salami, goose liver... Thank you. All right. He's not at home. Stay here. Wait for me. I want to know everything. And you can eat the bread and butter! Stop teasing me. I'm so hungry I almost fainted. I'm starving. I'm still growing so I have to eat hot food five times a day. And I haven't had anything to eat for a week. My foot! My hunch tells me that Vályi has nothing to do with this at all. Doctor Kardos, telephone. Yes. 117, who is it? Sárosi speaking. The guard has come to. He says he was attacked by his former mate, Zoltán Vályi. Order a nationwide search for Vályi. Inform the border crossings. He has a valid passport. Search for his car: dark green, Wartburg, license no. UM 12-90. Over and out. Let's go. 150. - Buy some matyó dolls. - I'd like some hair grower. Only if you buy some matyó dolls. I don't want them. No, you don't. Buy matyó dolls. Good day, Mr. Ötvös. Good day, Matuska. What is? You're working, are you? It's only a 4 hour job. You came to your senses at last? - No, I think I lost them. - What's that under the counter? In higher circles it's called "a combined deal". - That's against the rules. - I know. But try to sell these dolls according to the rules. - Isn't it for sale? - Sure it is. But I can't give you any hair grower. - Only dolls. - I have enough hair. - How much? - 100. Thank you. Wonderful dollies! Just 100! Hey, old man. Yes? Did you see a dark green Wartburg pass through here last night? License no. UM 12-90. I haven't seen a single car in the parking lot. There was only one car with UM plates but that was a Ford. You have a great talent for observation. Small wonder. I was a first class chess player for 39 years. I could still play simultaneous games on 20 boards any time. Thank you, Mr. Siminszky. Good bye. Good bye. - Congratulations, Mr. Ötvös. - From me, too. Let me invite you to the disco. I'll buy you some champagne. Make it two. Three. Four. I don't mind. Let it be five. Excuse me, haven't you seen Ötvös? I mean Csöpi. He hasn't come in yet. Able? Briquette? Homework, Cigar, Moustache. Do those names mean anything to you? They're all sitting there in the corner. Make sure they don't think you're after their girlfriends. Excuse me, I'm looking for Mr. Moustache. What do you want? Nothing. I just thought we might have a little chat. Why don't you clear off? What? Clear off, I said. To drink? - Do you have anything to eat? - Frankfurters. I hate those. To drink? Yes, a tonic. Three tonics. And a glass of milk for the little boy. Can't you be more careful? Why don't you go and restore order? One of our men is already up there. Please maintain your calmness. Your man is doing a good job. I wouldn't like to bump into him on a dark night. I wonder what else you know to amaze us. I'd make you an attraction if this disco was mine. He'd be a success with such versatile talent. Stop it, please. I blush very easily. You win races, you fight and what's more, you even get a borrowed sail for someone who forgot about it. Yes, Mr. Csík. How could it be possible that you forgot your sails? He might have known that help was on its way. Or I'm simply going senile. It would be too early for that, darling? Hello. Let's go for a ride. Look! Do you recognize him? Yes, it's my husband. Come on. Halt! Who's there? I'm a policeman. Me too. I'm looking for old Matuska. Please, step inside, colleague. Grandpa! Go back to bed, Bence. It's too early. My grandson. Come out to the porch, old man. Let's not bother the kid. Yes, sir. How old are you? 74. You were a sweet old scoundrel until now. Petty thefts, poaching, illegal fishing, etc. Why did you have to get involved in robbery and murder at your age? I don't understand, sir. You cut your left thumb with broken glass at the Greasy Spoon last October. Right? You took me in. How could I deny it? - All right, speak up! - About what? - About that green Wartburg. - I didn't take anything. The car was there between the road and the reeds. I thought I might as well have a look. The trunk was open, the doors were locked. Where was the car parked? Between the reeds and the road. Next to the lavender fields. At what time? Around 10 p.m. And what did you see in the trunk? This wrench and nothing else. You can show me exactly where that car was parked. Yes, sir. Come along. Come on. Now I'll show you. The car was parked right here. Facing the reeds. - Did you see any other cars? - No. But it must have come across the parking lot, so old Siminszky must have seen it. Do you know who I am? I guess so. You must be some local bum who took advantage of our slight inebriation last night. You can apologize to all of us a 3 o'clock in front of the girls. I'm not properly dressed. Then you'd better write your last will because we're going to have you for dinner. This guy wants to have a fight with us? Listen, old man, if you come across this statue, or if you give me any information that might be useful I'll buy you 500 spritzers. You have my word. I'll drink those spritzers soon. Give me a picture, too. - Good morning. - Good morning. I'm looking for old Siminszky. The old man has lots of visitors today. What do you mean? I can only tell you what I said to a man on the phone an hour ago: He went fishing. He's sitting at the third pier to the left of the harbor. Thank you. Csöpi. I spoke to the guys... I spoke to the guys from the laboratory. The hairs and the bloodstains on the candlestick belong to Vályi. Vályi was probably killed with the same gun as the guard. The blade of grass you sent in is also stained with Vályi's blood. Which means they transferred the statue there. Also means they didn't take the Wartburg. It was by the reeds. They took Vályi there in another car, shot him, and shoved him into his own trunk. He was bleeding heavily, so he must have left bloodstains in the other car as well. That's what I think, too. Oh, damn it. Damn! Where are we going? The other car could only have come through the hotel's parking lot. And since it happened at night, old Siminszky will tell us not only its license number but also the name of the newspaper in the back window. - Don't you think that I might catch cold like this? - Why? You're dressed, aren't you? I feel like Ernő Nemecsek dipped in the pool in the botanical garden. I should call my wife. We'll call her together just stop squelching for heaven's sake. I'm hungry, too. Did you know how horrible it is to have your shoes filled with water? Stay there, I've got something. - Come on! Help! - Stay out or help? Come on for Christ's sake! All right, pull it, old man. Just a second. - That's it. Pull hard. Keep it tight. - It is... Look, it's beauty. It must be at least 3 kilos. Congratulations. Thanks. She's ours now. - All right, pull me out. - Okay. - I mean with this one... Grab the oar. - I'm pulling. That's better. - Here. - All right. Damn. Say, old man, do you know who the second pier belongs to? Of course. It's Siminszky's He always comes later. He come here when he comes off duty around 5 or 5.30. I think he came by boat today. How do you know that? I saw a sailboat around his pier about one and a half hour ago. But I only saw the tip of its mast. You couldn't see what kind of boat it was, right? I couldn't tell two boats apart even if you brought them right here. I'm a fisherman not an Onassis. Dr. Kardos! No, it wasn't so tall. I saw less of the sail. The thirty square meter can go back. Send the Dragon out. That's suspicious. Now that star... That one's suspicious, too. Try to concentrate a little for God's sake. Send the Soling. Say, when the boat was there at the pier didn't you hear a bump or something? Of course I did. A huge splash. I thought the old man fell into the water. Watch this. Was it like that? No, it had a different sign. A red star. Yes, it had a five pointed red star. Or something like that. Dr. Kardos. Send the Star here immediately. Now watch carefully and tell me if the sign on this boat is the same as what you saw on the other one. Yes, it was exactly like that. Only it was higher. The star was almost at the tip of the sail. That's how I could see it. Thank you. Dr. Kardos, I want a motorboat. Where are we going? The killer's boat had a star emblem and the sign was high up on the sail. - I see. - We'll have to find that one. I see. Good clay, Dezső. I want permission to come over. I'm ordering you to do so. Thank you. Excuse me. - Hello Zsuzsi! - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? We don't see your boat today. I've some private matter to settle. Are you letting them sail? I don't think so. This weak wind keeps blowing in all directions. We'll have some north-westerly breeze by the afternoon. Give me your binoculars for a moment. - Here you are. - Thank you. - Would you give me a hand, darling? - What do you want, Csöpi? - Write down a few numbers for me, okay? - Okay. - Sorry. - No, no. 5837. 5837... This is from Siófok so it's not very likely to have come to Tihany this morning. But we might as well write it clown. 5849. 5849... Yes. 904. 904... 6456, G6456. 6456... And now we look up the crews from the list of entries. - Why do you want to know that? - Because I need it, darling. - What's this? - These boats carry their stars high. Here it is. 5837: - János Szántó, István Kanyó. - Yes. 5849: Ormos - Bánó. Yes. 904: Csík-Soltész, Austria. 6456: Borg-Schumann, Austria. Thank you. Give it to me for a second, Dezső. - Here you are. - Thank you. Iván, Iván, come in please. Here I am. I'm Ötvös from the jury's ship. Hello, Iván. Hi, Csöpi! You're not sick after your victory yesterday? No, unfortunately I have a private matter... lván, I want to know how you came out of Siófok this morning, by car, by boat or how? By boat in this windless weather? Our ten boats came with a tugboat. Thank you. Good bye, good sailing. Bye, Csöpi. You can cross out 5849. They were towed in. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Attention, please. According to the weather report, no wind can be expected before this afternoon, so the jury is postponing the race until 3 p.m. Good bye until then. All right, doc, let's get down to work. Yes. Take a motorboat to Tihany and check the passengers of the three boats. - All right. - Wait! Find out what cars they are driving. Okay. - Doc, there's something else. - What? Tie your shoelaces. It would be unpleasant for the whole organization if you stumbled. Jana! - Jana! - What is it, Csöpi? Give me a lift! Okay, let's go. Hi. Bye. Thanks. What are you after, darling? I'd like to know if you have some extra equipment. My friends. Damn it, you drink all of my supplies. Give me another one. Bitte, buddy. What are you going to do until 3 p.m.?? I have no idea. We should ask them for a 3 sports party. - What's that? - Footballtennis, tennis, minigolf. - What's the stake? - If you lose, you pay the bill. - All right? - All right. Mr. Csík. Herr Schumann. - Who's going to play tennis, Mr. Csík? - Frau Borg. That tiny thing? Oh, come on. That wasn't a joke. I meant it. All right. I'll put on something warm then, so I could sweat a little. I think it would be quite good to put on something warm. Here are the suspect crews of the three ships. Our man must be among them. - Kanyó... - He's got no car. - Borg. - He has a BMW. - Soltész? - His green Volvo is parked right here. - Csík... - Csík and his wife. A yellow Mercedes. Schumann? - He has a red Commodore. - A suspicious character. Szántó... His Lada is parked by the tennis court. That's what I said. Bravo, doc! Sniff around those cars in half an hour. You might find something in them. Inside? Inside. That's illegal. That's illegal. I won't do it. It's very likely that the one they took up at the Abbey is among them. I'm not going to commit an illegal intrusion. I'll settle that. Even if they tear my stripes off. I'm in charge of this investigation. I forbid you to use illegal methods. Okay, boss. Csöpi! I won't participate in anything fishy. Wait for me here. I'll be right back. We'll wait for you, colleague. Yes, hey! Frau Borg is winning by five games to love. Your turn. What a job! Love-fifteen. Extra good car wash. You're not going to fool me, you old scoundrel. Leave me out of this. What's that? 40 Forints or 10 Marks. I just remembered... German Mark not good, Only Hungarian Forint. Why? Somehow I don't trust Deutschmarks. The keys, please. Be sure to wash mine. It's a Lada 1500, ZP 32-47. It's parked in front of the hotel. Which car? The registration number is W... ...320 826. I know. I'm only asking for the sake of conspiracy. Wash ours, too. A yellow Mercedes, in front of the hotel. W 144580. - What about yours? - My car doesn't need washing. I'll be back in half an hour. My foot! I've sprained my ankle. Mr. Csík, please take over. I'll go and see a doctor! Jesus! I'm sorry. Excuse me! Jana! Take me to the hotel, I've sprained my ankle. I've got to see a doctor. I'm sorry, I'm not forfeiting this match. My car's right over there. All right, thanks. - What's up? - I've found this in the Commodore. - It could be interesting. - Send it to the lab! There's nothing in the Mercedes and the BMW. We've found a stain in the Commodore. I had it sent up to the lab. We took some samples, but I really don't feel like doing this. All right, doc, I'll take the responsibility. Give me the keys to the Commodore. Don't forget to wash my car. - Your car? - That's right. Like you promised. Here's the key to the Volvo. God damn! - Take it back where you got it from! - All right, colleague. - Dr. Kardos! - Stop yelling, I'm right here. I don't agree with your methods. We can talk about that another time. Write "Volvo - Soltész" on the envelope. Go to the lab right now. It's all yours, Matuska. I'll buy you another hundred spritzers if you find out something about the owners of these cars. I'll never close my eyes again. I'll stick unto them, the stakes are too high. I'll wash these cars first and yours a bit later. No, you won't. You said you'd do it, So get down to it. You can hand the keys over to that young man. He'll pay you. Hey, sir. Can you please wash this car? - No German, no work. - Shit... This isn't capitalism where workers have to work, you know! Everything is in order, colleague. To the races, gentlemen. Mr. Csík, to the races. Shall we go? It is my duty to participate in the race. - Here is Mr. Ötvös' keys. - Thank you. I've washed his car. I want my 50 Forints. Deutschmarks are also accepted. You've picked the right man! Are you a cop as well? A call for dr. Kardos. Yes... - Hello, is it you, Margit? - What do you mean, Margit? This is Sub-lieutenant Bélai. We have the lab report. The Commodore-Schumann envelope is not very interesting. Those stains were from an animal... - And the other one? - That's a great haul! - Vályi's blood is there on the thread. - What? Congratulations, Dr. Kardos. Attention, the finals! G 6511... Now! This is the police. Stop! Stop! - Gábor Soltész? - Yes. - Come over here, please. - Me? - I'd like to ask you a few questions. - About what? Go if they tell you. I'll tell you later. Come on over. Go if they tell you. I'll take the boat to shore. - I'd like to leave it right here. - Please, come over. Let go of that, please. - Pull out the super cop! - Okay. Catch! That's it. Calm down. Józsi, give me your car, will you? - You can take it, the keys are inside. - Thanks. Get out! Hurry up! - Csöpi! - I'm so glad you came, Buksza. Stay here and watch. My main witness is right here in this wheel. Burn it! Calling 21, come in. Over. This is 21, come in, over. Ötvös speaking. Listen, sonny. And we're always amazed at those jokes about cops. What's this, a good luck charm? Yes, it has always come in handy. Don't you think it's rather strange for a policeman to carry horseshoes in his car in 1980? I hereby confiscate it, in the name of materialism. One meter fifty. Sir, there's been a frontal collision. We're investigating the scene. Thank you. Carry on. That's all you have to say to each other? Yes, the more so because that's about all I know in English. - Two whiskies, please. - No whiskey, - apricot brandy, please. - Let it be two apricot brandies. It seems that Mr. P. Smith knows a lot about drinks. - Here you are. - Thank you. - Auto, okay. - Okay? Well, it will be okay. Cheers. Will be? Apricot? Apricot. Two apricots, please. Well, neither of us has much to boast about. - Cigarettes? - No, thank you. I've smoked too many already. Mr. Csík, Soltész wasn't with you at the last races, was he? I had another partner, but we split. He started flirting with my Zsuzsi. Thank you. Did you go out in your own boat this morning? How interesting! You all think alike! Your colleague asked me the same at the police station. I can tell you, if you want to hear it. I overslept this morning. I took the motorboat. I got into the boat on the water. Soltész took it out by himself. When? Ask him. You have him. How did you meet this Soltész? We're in the same club. He offered his services when he heard that I had no partner. I never had any trouble with him so far. Darling! Why did you hide away? To drink this special apricot brandy. To your health. Do sailors drink such amounts in the world? No, only in the spring and summer. And autumn. And in the winter. - To slightly intoxicated ladies! - Idiot! Isn't she sweet? We've been together for one and a half years. I'm 30 years older than her. And I'm in love like a teenager. It's all right now but what will happen in ten years? Do you know the old joke? I'll dump the old hag. Oh, I'm sorry. What does this little fellow want here? He's waiting for you. Damn old Matuska, why can't he tell him to go to bed? He said it was because of you. He went out to keep watch because you made him a very favorable deal. That's all I need. Give me my key, please. Thank you. Well, where's the Madonna? Why did you shoot Vályi? I'll tell you: first, because he was wounded, second, because the guard recognized him. Hello. - Give me the Vályi files. - Here you are. Which school did you attend in Hungary? Get off my back. Why did you shoot Siminszky? I didn't shoot anyone. Madame, I know it's very late, please excuse me. Yes, yes. Only one question. Your husband's graduation photograph there on the wall... When you heard that they discovered the Wartburg with Vályi you phoned the reception, they told you: Siminszky was out fishing. You took your boat and shot Siminszky with this gun. He was the only witness. After that you attended the races as if nothing had happened. Is that right? That's ridiculous. I've already told you. I want my lawyer. Who are your partners? Where's the Madonna? - Call my lawyer! - Why did you shoot Vályi? - Who is this Vályi? - That's strange. I know that there are people who were born in the same year and they don't know each other. Also people who went to the same high school and they still don't know each other. But this is the first time that I hear of two people who went to the same school and graduated from the same class, and they still don't know each other. I want my lawyer. I won't tolerate to be abused by two little lieutenants. I used to be in the higher ranks, Mr. Soltész. Until recently I'd hit a worm like you so hard that he spat his teeth out. I hope you're not going to use violence! There are things which disgust me. Klári, please get me Vienna, 12-72-07. - Csöpi! - Thank you. Hello! Hello, Hans? Ahoy. Ötvös here. I'd like you to find out something for me. And anyway, why aren't you here, the race is really fine this year. That's a pity. Well, Gábor Soltész, Vienna, 11 Schulerstrasse, born in Siófok in 1940. Yes, everything. I'm staying at the Tihany hotel. Okay, thanks. Hansi, ahoy. - What? - Nothing. What makes you think they graduated together with Vályi? He's on Vályi's graduation photograph. You walked right in front of it. I'm hungry. It's 5:30. I'm going to starve to death. Get me some food. I'm sure you can. I can but it's against the regulations. I'll close my eyes. We have lived long enough to hear that... What? That you'll close your eyes. You, for me... Stop fooling around. I'm hungry. What's that, a soft drink? Yeah, apricot brandy. How many? Two. Make it three. So we're in progress now. I think it was the plot of Soltész and Vályi. Now the whole thing is finished. Except one little thing. Where's the Madonna? Have you seen Soltész's room? How could I? But I do have a search warrant now. All right, go ahead. Maybe the Madonna will smile at you. I'll have a look at their boat. Listen, I wanted to tell you earlier, I think I can manage on my own. You can go back sailing if you want to. Whatever you say. You're the boss. I should make a phone call. Did you find something? What do you want here? I escaped. The robbers knocked me out and took me to a room. I came to, the door was open so I just escaped. The robber was me, I took you to my room because you fell asleep in the hall. All right, let's forget it. Give it to me. Come on into the water. It's cold! Come on. Now, we'll make minced meat out of you, buster. This game is not for kids like you. Such salivating pimps should stay behind the skirts of their whores. Give me that kid. Any complaints or remarks? Yes! Please. That was that, colleague. We didn't find anything. We searched his apartment thoroughly but the Madonna is not there. Csík agreed to search his room, but that was in vain. Shall I stay? No, just go on sailing. What about your wife? What do you mean? Did you phone her? Oh, that! No, you can't just make a phone call in this country. - I'll write her a card. - Do you have a pen? Idiot. Let it out! Let it out! One minute before the start. 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 - now! Hurray! Come on sweetheart, go for it! Look, we're falling behind. Pull in the main sail. Hurry, there's something wrong. There's absolutely nothing. Are you crazy? Attention, the finals are coming. 6311. 1 : Ötvös-Áros. Now! - Hello! - Hello, sir. No. 402. It's been taken already. What do you mean, I live alone! I've been waiting for you, colleague. Naughty little boy. Don't you dare take my keys again without permission. And I'm not your colleague, is that clear? What's the news? Nothing. - Hello. - Is that you, Margit? Yes. No matter how hard you blow on it, it never topples. Why not? That's a complicated matter. You can't understand. Of course, I can. I'm not stupid. If it starts leaning, the wind hits a smaller surface, and the boat is pulled back by the weights in its keel. See? It's like a toy that always bounces back. It leans, the weights pull it back. It leans again, the weights... Give it to me! It topples... Here. Hey, it sinks. Hello, Hansi, ahoy! Hello, old Matuska. Hello, Mr. Ötvös. I'll pay the whole season for you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. That felt good. Congratulations, Csöpi. Congratulations. - Congratulations. - My deepest regards. Is your boat on dry land, Mr. Csík? That old wreck, yes, it is on the trailer. I've just phoned to Italy. I asked them to send a new boat. I wish I could leave this old thing here... Pardon. Just stay here. Didn't count on this, did you, Mr. Super Cop! I just learnt through the phone that you and Soltész lived in Vienna for five years. I tried to call you so many times, Margit. What? No, this is a ball. Or a banquet. What the hell... No, no, no. There are no women. We're working. Working real hard. No, there's nothing yet. Nothing. I was lucky. I was lucky because Csík is a real sportsman. Soltész left the original sails at home but he used borrowed ones. And I was lucky because there was a strong wind, and I figured from the swaying of the boat that at least 200 kilograms were missing from the keel. The little mishap of me shooting you won't even count compared to your achievements. Tell me just one thing. The person with the other revolver is not lstván Csík, is he? No, he's a jeweler. He'd give anything for the Madonna. And I'm fond of money. Well, it's over. This bullet will be a revenge for Soltész, too. One... two... Guns are really flying low nowadays. I said, guns fly really low. You don't understand the essence of our work, Margit. Kovács, follow me. Arrest him! Come on. Here. Have you found it? This is it, sir. Turn it towards us. Lift up your chin! - The lady as well, please. - Thank you. Turn the Madonna around. Just a second. Very good. Great. Smile. Very good, thank you. Come on, I'll buy you a coke, Mr. colleague.
