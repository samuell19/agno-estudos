(ominous music) (people shouting) - Gareth? (suspenseful music) Gareth? Gareth? I know it's you. (creepy music) My call time is in two hours! What do you think you're doing? (mysterious music) I'm not having this conversation again. Go on, get out. (shadowy music) You're pathetic, you know that? It was a mutually beneficial arrangement. It's business. You of all people should've known that. (wicked music) Gareth. (glass shattering) Gareth! Gareth! (dramatic music) Oh my god. (menacing music) I'm sorry, stop! (Carly sobs) Stop! (Carly screams) (suspicious music) - [Adrienne] Mr. Baskin, Hollywood's not standing for that kind of behavior anymore. - It's what I do, okay? I appreciate beautiful things, beautiful women, you know. If they got offended, I promoted them. That's a win-win, right? I mean, why can't we just say that? - [Adrienne] Because that's basically just hush. - Whatever. (crunching) Okay. Why don't we announce a big donation to Hands Off? - That's a hash tag. The foundation is Speak Out Safe. - Why don't we launch an anti sexual harassment program online? - They already have one. - You know what? I don't hear any good ideas coming from you. - All right. Tell the truth. Apologize. - That's a great start. What else you got? - Listen, I think maybe you're looking for a different perspective. - Absolutely not. You, you're perfect. You're young, you're hungry, I'll say it, attractive, you know. If you fix this, I'll give you all my PR work for years to come. Huh? - That is a very generous offer, Mr. Baskin, but I started my own firm so that I could choose my clients, clients that I would be proud to represent. - Come on. (laughs) Don't you feel the rapport here a little bit, you know? I mean, the connection? - No, not really. Now if you'll excuse me, I have another meeting. - All right, how about I triple your rate? - It's not always about money, Mr. Baskin. - Well you know what? Your agency's probably gonna tank in the next month anyway. Loser. - [Mina] Where's mommy? - [Adrienne] Oh Mina, you know where she is. - [Mina] The gallery. - [Adrienne] Anyway, how was school? - [Mina] Bad. - [Adrienne] Aw, honey, why's that? - Juan didn't choose me for his soccer team at lunch! Are boys always jerks? - No! Sometimes they grow up to be idiots. (Mina laughs) - Auntie Adrienne, why can't I go to mom's show? I've been so good. - Oh honey, it's got nothing to do with that. You're perfect. Trust me, it's just gonna be a bunch of old people standing around doing boring old people stuff. - I don't care. I want to go. And anyways, you're not old. - I put the whole thing together. I have to support her, you know. - [Mina] I guess. - But I have hired the best caterers in the entire city, and they make these amazing mini cheesecakes. I'm gonna bring you home more than you can eat in a week. No, in a month. - Or a year! - Done! - You're the best aunt ever! - I kind of am, aren't I? (Mina and Adrienne laughing) - [Ramona] Mm mm, darling, this is a fantastic opening you've thrown for Emily, but what if nobody buys anything? Is she gonna be able to handle it? She could have another breakdown. - [Adrienne] Have a little faith, Ramona. Whatever happens, we'll get through it together like we always do. - [Ramona] Well, she does have your genes. - Mona, look around. Everybody loves it. Oh, meatballs. No, thank you though. - Honestly, this soiree makes me miss having you work for me. - Remember that when I come crawling back for my old job. - Oh stop it. You were born to run your own shop. - We need to talk. - Emily, I am so sorry, but look, it's only been a couple of hours, and I have always said, your work, it's very specific. - Specific? - This is all a process. - Well you should've warned me. This is your fault. - Wait a minute, what? - Gotcha. I sold my very last piece. (Ramona and Emily laughing) - I am going to kill you. Come here. Amazing. - Those two trophy wives over there actually got into a bidding war. - Wow. - Of course they did. Congratulations. - Thank you. And seriously, thank you so much. I mean, this is all you. - No, stop it. Go talk to that man over there with the fedora. He writes for the Times. - Seriously, can't you just let loose with me one night, please? - I will, I will, after you do the rounds one more time. Now go. - Go on, I got this. - Fine. (phone dings) - I deserve this. - Oh wow. - What? - Adrienne, Carly Nicks is dead. - Oh no no, that's just an internet rumor. - No, they've confirmed it. They found her in her home, strangled. - Oh my god, what? According to who? - It's on TMI Today. - [Adrienne] What? - Carly Nicks was sitting comfortably on the A list, with an Oscar nom expected for her role as a deaf activist, but early this morning, Carly Nicks was found strangled in her home. What kind of monster would take the life of America's sweetheart? Who? This guy. Carly's estranged hubby, Gareth Nicks, who is currently playing the role of an innocent man, another assured flop. However, Gareth's manager, Phil Navarro, claims he was with the washed-up has-been the entire night, to which I say sure he was, Phil. This is TMI Today where too much information is just enough. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, of course. It's just it's been a long night. - [Nikki] Carly's estranged hubby, Gareth Nicks, whose last two action flicks, well, flickered out. However, Gareth's manager, Phil... - I can't watch this anymore. I'm going to bed. - How could Ramona not know that you and Gareth used to date in college? You're not hiding it that well. - I need to take this down. - Ah, sorry. The internet's forever. - Ramona would've just pressured me to bring him in as a client. We were young. It wasn't that serious. - Uh, excuse me, three years is serious, and you were crazy about him. - How do you even remember? You were a self-involved 16-year-old. - Well I'm still self-involved. Doesn't mean I don't pay attention. You broke up with him, right? - Yeah. It was that year. I didn't want him staying with me just because he felt sorry for me. - Is there something you're not telling me? Well Hollywood's a small place. You guys must've bumped into each other. - We saw each other for coffee a few times. It was always awkward. - Why, because you were scared of him? - No. (tentative music) Because I broke his heart. Good morning. - Mm. - Where's mommy? - Sleeping. Did you know that koala bears are actually really mean? - Well, cute isn't always kind, young lady. - You promised me cheesecake. - I'll make it up to you. I will bring you something home tonight, okay? - In that case I'd rather have flan. - Do you even know what flan is? - Pudding in the shape of a turtle. - (laughs) You are strange. - So, you know who's really strange? - Who? - Juan. - Mm. You kind of like this Juan, don't you? - No, gross. Boys are disgusting! Plus, I'm way too young. - Good girl. Have a good day. - Don't forget my flan. - I won't. - [Nikki] Gareth Nicks, still a person of interest, seems to be laying low lately. Hm, why could that be? Stay tuned, because this'll only get juicier, people. - Ugh, that was my turn. Hey. - It's incredible. - [Adrienne] What is? - That Gareth Nicks could do it. - Hey, let's, let's talk about you and why you're thinking of changing PR firms. - You don't actually buy his alibi, do you? - Well I don't have any reason to believe that he's lying. - Phil Navarro. You know he pretended to be from Texas for a whole month when he was trying to sign me? - Did he? - Yeah. - Well, look. I think that I could be a huge asset to you. Now you would be my first country music star, but regardless... - Do you have any snacks? I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be rude. It's just I'm coming off this cleanse and I feel like my whole body is eating itself. - I had some peanuts, but... I will see what I can find. I'll be right back. - Thanks. ♪ Bass drum ♪ ♪ Overdrive system ♪ ♪ It's blowing up my mind ♪ ♪ I can't decide ♪ - Call Adrienne Kleiner. - [Woman On Recording] Hi, you've reached the offices of Adrienne Kleiner.

(majestic music) (moves into eerie music) Hey! (sharp thudding) (dramatic music) (tires squealing) (suspenseful music) (Adrienne gasps) - Gareth? What? - Yeah. How'd you recognize me? - You have worn that exact outfit in like the last four of your films. - Oh, so you watch my movies? - Gareth, honestly, I'm exhausted. - No no, I'm sorry. Listen, I'm sorry about the whole... I was just, I was just waiting for you to get home and, and then you did and I froze, you know. - That was really creepy. - That's not the impression I wanted to make after that many years. - Why are you here? - Well actually my manager was gonna call, you know, Phil, but, uh, I think it'd be better if we talked face to face. You know, I'm sorry. I should go. - Gareth, do you realize that every tabloid in Hollywood is hunting for you right now? You can't be out like this. - (laughs) Yeah, hence my lame and completely useless disguise. - Gareth. - Five minutes. Please. It's important. - Five minutes. Go around the back. I don't want you waking up my sister and niece. Come on, Gareth. You know everyone is gonna expect your manager to lie for you. - Exactly. In the court of public opinion, I'm already convicted. I need a solid PR campaign to revise the narrative. - Oh no, no. Gareth, please, don't. Well, look, if I do choose to represent you, and that is a big if, you need to level with me. - Do you need me to pinky promise? - Don't. Look. I am never gonna lie for you. All I do is tell the truth so that it is fully understood. - Deal. - All right, let's start again. Why are you here? - Because no one else will return my calls. - That's honest. - I didn't kill her, Adrienne. You know me, and you know I'm telling you the truth. I need you. - [Emily] I have coffee ready. Now tell me what happened with Gareth. - [Adrienne] Just a minute. - Did he lose it when you told him to get out? Wait, you don't think he's innocent, do you? - Yeah, I believe that you're innocent until proven guilty. - Didn't you start your own firm so you'd never have to work with creeps? - Among other things. - So, okay, why? Are you still hung up on him or something? - Please. - Well it's not like you've had a slough of serious boyfriends since you guys broke up. - Maybe I don't want a slough. - Oh you don't even date anymore. - Why would I have the time to date? I barely have time to have dinner with you guys. - Yeah, that's a choice. - Yeah, it's me choosing to pay our mortgage, Em. - Yeah, and what would I know about that? - I'm sorry. I don't want to fight. I get it, you're worried about me. I know. - People change, sis. - Not that much. - Well I did. Or do you still think I'm about to fall apart again? - No. No, absolutely not.

Um, we'll, we'll call you if we have anymore questions, all right? Everything okay? - Yeah. (worried music) - Adrienne, wait up. Are you all right? How did you get away? Did he hurt you? - What? No, I just found him. How are you even here? - I have my sources. Lots of them. Word is he was desperate to talk to you. Why? - No comment. - Look, I can play nice. Okay, I know your reputation. I know you're one of the good ones, which is why we're gonna pretend you were never here. - Thank you. - As long as you drop Gareth Nicks. I'm making it my business to sink him and anyone who helps him. Understand? - What has he ever done to you? - Nothing. This is Hollywood, honey. He's ratings gold. And don't pretend. You're in the game just like I am. - I may be nice, but I do not scare easily. - (laughs) That's only because I haven't said boo yet. (unfriendly music) - [Adrienne] I have got nothing to hide. - One segment about Adrienne Kleiner the killer lover and your life becomes very complicated. - No, Gareth has an alibi. Had one. - Exactly. You know, maybe Phil knew the truth and Gareth didn't think that he could keep a secret, so... - Maybe. No, maybe not! - Regardless, this doesn't bode well for anyone, you especially. - Ramona, come on! You have repped way worse people than this. - Yes, and I had the funds to defend myself if the story became about me. - Point taken. - Yeah. Look, if you have to do this, just promise me you'll be discrete. - I'm well aware of the potential... (phone dings) That's a voice mail. - [Ian On Voice Mail] Hi, my name is Ian Coulter. I'm actually at your office. I need to talk to you about Gareth. - What's going on? - Someone's just shown up at my office. They have information about Gareth. - And the plot thickens. - I'll talk to you later. - Hey, be careful. (foreboding music) - Hi, I'm Ian. So you're the one that got away. - Excuse me? - Gareth, that's what he always used to say about you. - Are you sure he was talking about me? - Oh, 100%. You look even prettier in person. - Wow. Thank you. Um, okay, wow. Please, take a seat. - Oh, yeah. - Tell me, how do you know Gareth? - Yeah, ah. Sorry. Um, so I've, I've known Gareth for years. I've, I've been his stunt double, uh, - Whoa, that is quite a while. - Yeah. Yeah, it's been a long time, long enough for me to know that, you know, Gareth would never harm Carly. - Yeah, I know. How would you feel about talking to Nikki Leone about Gareth? - Who is she? - Really? - What? - Never mind. She's the host of TMI Today. It's a celebrity gossip show. She has made it her mission in life to bury Gareth. - Why? - You don't want to know. How about you just say to her basically what you told me, that Gareth was nothing but kind to Carly? Let's just stress that Gareth really wanted to get back with Carly, but not in a stalkery way, if you know what I mean. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah, no. Yeah, I can do that. - Great. Okay. Thank you. - It was great. Really great meeting you. - You too. (touching music) Bye. - [Ian] Bye. (ponderous music) (phone vibrating) - Turns out Gareth and Carly were headed for splitsville, and a source close to the washed-up star told me that Gareth was heartbroken and ready to do anything to make her stay. And now enraged die-hard Carly Nicks fans have stormed his home. How did they know where he lived? This girl isn't telling. Gareth, darling, you probably should just fess up. He'd be much safer in a prison cell. This is TMI Today where too much information... - No, what have I done? - [Emily] What have you done? - [Adrienne] I sent Ian to tell Nikki that Gareth wanted to get back together with Carly. - Right. - And now I've made it worse! Much worse! - Well, maybe this was a sign. - What do you mean? - That taking on Gareth was a mistake. - Oh, man. (ominous music) (drill whirring) Gareth? - Hey. - Hey. Isn't that Gareth's car? - Actually, Gareth caught me eyeing his on set, and the next day I rolled up and that was parked in front of my trailer with a giant bow around it. - What? Wow. Next time you should compliment his house. How do you know where I live? - Gareth. - Not entirely appropriate. - Uh, no, please, don't be mad. I just wanted to apologize in person because I think I got a little nervous during that interview and I may have said the wrong thing. - Oh no, you did nothing wrong. It was my idea. My bad idea. - No, that, that's not true at all. - I don't know. Maybe I'm just not as good at this as I thought I was. - All right, you know what? I think someone needs a pep talk. How about I take you out to dinner? - I would love that. But I really have to put out this fire first. But you're welcome to come in for coffee. - Uh, uh, you know what? I'm, I got myself in enough trouble already. How about just give me a ring if you need anything, okay? - Yeah. See ya. - [Ian] All right, bye. (perplexed music) - God. Gareth, you could get a gardener. Shit. Oh man. (uncertain music) Oh, wow. All right. (crowd screaming) - [Gareth] It's about time. - Oh jeez. Yeah, well it's not easy walking like a mile uphill to sneak around back. - Well I didn't want you to wade through the crazies out front. Let's talk inside. Somebody was flying a drone an hour ago and woke me up. - What? Woke you up? It's like 1:00 in the afternoon. - Yeah, what's there to wake up for? I don't understand. - I lined up another PR firm for you, which I have hand-selected. - Of course you have. - They deal with major corporations facing nasty public lawsuits. - Oh, like when a chemical company gives a whole town asthma. Great. - I am out of my depth here, Gareth. - Or you just want off a sinking ship that could tarnish your stellar reputation. - Gareth, I tried. - You tried? That's Adrienne, folks. She tries. Give her a gold star. (glass shatters) (Adrienne gasps) (malicious music) You didn't deserve that. I'm sorry, it's... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just, I just, I haven't been sleeping. I, I'm stuck in my own house. I'm going a little nuts. I know you're doing everything you can. Hey! Hey! Get off my property! That's it, cops said they couldn't do anything until they trespassed on my property. Where's my phone? - You don't have a landline? - What am I, 80? I'm gonna check upstairs. Can you check my car? It's in the garage, it's unlocked. - Sure. (locks clicking) (engine cranks) Weird. (eerie music) Gareth! (Adrienne sniffs) (Adrienne coughs) God! Gareth! (labored breathing) Gareth! Oh god! (labored breathing) (car horn honks) Gareth! (car horn honks) (Adrienne coughs) - Okay? - Where am I? - You're at my place. Here, drink this. - What happened? - Well, somebody rigged my car to fill with gas while simultaneously locking you inside. I'm assuming it was meant for me, given there's a mob of Carly Nicks fans on my front lawn who'd prefer I was dead. Half the window is still in my hand. - Where are the police? Why am I not in a hospital? - So I was about to call 911, but you were breathing, so I decided to... - I could've died. - [Gareth] Yeah, but the internet said as long as you were breathing and I could get you out of... - Really? You went on WebMD for 10 minutes and you're a doctor now? - I'm a murderer, Adrienne. No no no no no. According to those people and half the world, thanks to Nikki Leone and TMI Today, I killed my wife. Do you understand? What do you think is gonna happen when they find out another woman almost died in my house? - I get it. I get it. - I am sorry. I am so sorry. I just, I didn't know what to do. You're okay, right? - Yeah. Thank you. - Please. (gentle music) And on another note, you're fired. I just can't let something happen to you. - I quit already, remember? - You tried to quit, but now I'm firing you. - All right then. What are you gonna do? I mean, you can't stay here. - I already booked a suite at the Rembrandt. - Which will be fine until the concierge calls Nikki Leone. - Fine, you're rehired. What do I do? - Uh, just stay with me. - Stay with you? - Temporarily. Just until all of this blows over. - Doesn't Emily live with you? - And her daughter, Mina, yeah. - And you're sure this is a good idea? - Don't worry, all right. It'll be fine. - [Emily] What the hell were you thinking? - [Adrienne] It's temporary! - Yeah, of course it is, because any second now the cops are gonna break down the door and drag him away! - He's not safe at his house! - Not my problem! - I would never do anything to jeopardize you two! - Oh yeah? Yeah, well you just did! - He's staying, Emily! This is my house! - Oh yeah, thanks for the reminder. - Hey Emily. - Really? - Been a while. - Look, Gareth, I just really... - Look, I thought it was a terrible idea too, but your sister wouldn't budge. - What happened to your hand? - Nothing. I just cut it making a sandwich. Not very eventful. - Yeah, I bet. I, I, I can't, I gotta go. - [Mina] Is mommy mad? - No, she'll be fine, sweetie. I promise. - Okay. He's Rolo, did you know? - I didn't think anyone actually saw that movie. - The wizard that moved to the suburbs? Yeah, it's in, what, like your top five? - My top one. - Oh, number one. - Mm. - Hey Mina, how would you feel if Rolo stayed with us for a bit? - Really? - Yeah, you bet. - Yes! Want to come see my room? - Uh, I don't know, can I? Or is it so messy I'll need a cleaning spell? - (laughs) A cleaning spell, those don't exist. Okay, I'll go clean my room. (Gareth laughs) - Well done. - Hey, how about I make dinner for you guys tonight? My carbonara might even thaw out your sister. - Sure, but I've got plans. - Do you? - Yeah. You know the guy. Ian. - Ian? Coulter? Really? - What, you got an issue? - No no no no no, he's a solid guy. He's a magician when it comes to cars, guns, and stunts. - Oh cool, I'll keep that in mind next time I need help busting through a window. Why don't you try and whip up that pasta and win over my sister? - Oh, all right, no pressure. - Oh come on, you're an actor. Just pretend to be someone she doesn't want to kick out of the house. (Gareth laughs) (affectionate music) (moves into misty music) (knocking on the door) Hey. - Oh, I, uh, got you something. - Aw, thank you. They're beautiful. - [Ian] Thanks. - Hey, I just have to go get my purse. Can you wait here one sec? - [Ian] Yes. - Okay, I'll be right back. - Okay. - Okay. - Here we go. - I want a lot. - [Gareth] Okay, here we go, a lot. Are you ready? Rolo's magic pasta. - Whoa. - That's enough. - [Mina] More! (dishes clinking) (foreboding music) - Ian! - Gareth. - What's going on? - [Ian] Hey, guys. - Adrienne is letting me crash here. It got a little weird at my place. - Oh, you're, you're staying here? - Yeah, crazy, huh? - Yeah, not everyone's thrilled about it. - I am. - Although if everything you cook tastes like this. - Better. - [Emily] Sure. - Hey, you guys could always eat in. I made plenty. - Uh, that's okay. I made reservations. - She made reservations. - Next time. - Yeah, for sure. - Hey, we should catch up. - It was really good to see you. - Hey Em, do you mind putting those flowers in a vase for me? - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. Bye, guys. - Enjoy. - Hey pal, have her back by 11:00. - I will be home when I please. - Oh, (laughs) she's the boss. - Is there bacon in this? I love bacon. - Well then yeah, there's bacon in it. - Yes! - [Ian] Hey, was that awkward? - No. No, we're ancient history. Why, was it uncomfortable for you? - No, no, no, not at all. - I'm sorry, I didn't realize that you were gonna come in and... - We're good, honestly. - Okay. - You know, I wanted to take you somewhere before dinner. Do we have time? - Uh, yeah. Reservations aren't until 8:00. - All right, but it's, it's not for the faint of heart. - Sounds like a challenge. - You up for it? - Why not? - [Ian] Game on. It's gonna be a good time. - [Adrienne] Good time, huh? - [Ian] Mm-hm. - [Adrienne] Good time with my stuntman. - [Ian] Mm-hm. (foreboding music) - [Adrienne] What is that? - [Ian] I've done this a thousand times, trust me. (untrusting music) - Are we almost there? - Ah! Mm. - Hey, are you all right? - Yeah, no, I'm fine. It's just 20 years of stunt work, that's what it'll do to you. (laughs) My knee is practically titanium at this point. - Have you seen a specialist? - After a while they just prescribe you more painkillers. I'll live. Come on, it's just, it's right over here. (wondering music) - It is beautiful. - Yeah, top of the world. You know, I always told Gareth that he should take Carly up here. - What, with his fear of heights? Uh-uh. (Ian laughs) - [Ian] You knew about that, huh? - Yeah. - You know, when he finished The Dark Cult, he drove for two straight days to avoid flying home from set. - What? That is even more dangerous, statistically speaking. - Carly, she used to fly everywhere. It drove him nuts! - I bet. - What do you think happened with her, honestly? - Some disturbed fan. - You know, you're one of the few people that believe that he's innocent. Why? - Because whoever did that to Carly is evil. Gareth isn't evil. - You seem certain about that. - You know, he would've stuck by me during the most difficult year in my life if I had let him. - Yep. That's Gareth. - Can I trust you? - Yes, no, of course. - Someone is trying to kill him. - What, who? - They rigged his car. They tried to make it look like he had committed suicide. - Okay, that's crazy. - I know, right? I went into his car to get his cellphone and I got trapped inside. I almost died. - Okay, maybe it's too dangerous for you to be around Gareth. Maybe you just need to... - Gareth's the only reason that I'm alive. He pulled me out. (questioning music) What's wrong? - I'm sorry, it's, it's just I lost someone a few years ago, someone very special. - I am so sorry. My mom passed away when I was 20. I know it's not the same, but... - It casts a dark shadow, don't it? - It really affected Emily. She's always had issues, but it just made it so much worse. - Drugs? - No. Her brain wasn't wired right. She fought it with meds, everything. (sensitive music) Having Mina helped. But geez, it has been a long, difficult road to get her back on solid ground. - She's lucky to have you. - Thank you. But with everything that we have been through, I feel like I'm the lucky one. (sentimental music) - Gareth was right about you. You are the one that got away. (hushed music) - Hey. - [Gareth] Hey. - How was your night? - Hey, for old times sake. - [Adrienne] For old times sake. So, what have you been up to? - I've just been sitting here regretting every decision I've ever made. - Oh come on. I would say those decisions led you to an incredible life. And they got you Carly. - True. But if I'm being honest, she wasn't always a picnic. - Was it hard watching her become more and more successful while you are struggling? - Actually, no. I mean, that's what everybody thinks, but, uh, I've had a blessed life. It was her turn, I get it. - Well so, what was the problem? - She'd been cheating on me. - Oh. Geez, I'm, I'm sorry. - She eventually fessed up, and I never figured out who the guy was. When we decided to reconcile, she broke it off with him. - Gareth, Carly has a jilted ex who has ample reason to have... - No. - This could exonerate you! - I'm not gonna smear her to save my own butt. - You hired me to do a job, right? I'm telling you, you don't have the luxury to do that. - You know, after Emily put Mina to bed, we had a chance to talk. - About what? - About the year we broke up. About your mom. About Emily's problems. Why did you keep that from me? - You were on your way to a new life. - A new life that was supposed to include you. - My mom was dying. My sister was off her meds. I was in college. I'm allowed to have made a few mistakes. - So dumping me was a mistake? (emotional music) - All right, I have to be up at 5:00. - Good night. - Night. (gentle music) Hey, Mina. - Hi. - How was school? - You're late. - 15 minutes tops. Will you forgive me? - Forgiven. Guess what? - What? - I told everyone that Rolo was staying at our house and no one believed me. Juan called me a liar, so I said that he'd be at our play date on Saturday. - Honey. You, me, and your mom were gonna keep that between us, remember? - I know, it was just too exciting to keep a secret. And people shouldn't be keeping secrets anyways. It's rude. - True. - [Mina] So he can come? - Let's get ice cream. - Yes! - [Ramona] Well, that's a mess of your own making. - What would you do? - [Ramona] I'd ask my former boss to help save the day because she just... - So help me. Come on, I am not in the mood. - Okay, relax. I went along my secret grapevine and I, uh, found this ripe little number. - I don't get it. - [Ramona] Just press play. - Ian! - Oh my god. - Come on buddy, I got you. - Gareth. - [Gareth] Come on, stay with me! - Where is this from? - It's from a behind-the-scenes documentary from Gareth's movie Overdrive. - He risked his life! - And someone who risks his life like that for another human being, they don't kill their wife. - Why has this not come out earlier? - A second stunt driver died in the accident. The studio buried the story. This was pre TMI Today, when you could actually do that. - This is huge. - Yeah. So use it. Or don't use it. I'm gonna leave it up to you. - I owe you one. - Just get through all this craziness with Gareth, then back to building your dreams, and then we'll be even. - [Ian] Hey. - [Adrienne] Hey, thanks for meeting me. - Yeah, what's going on? - What is this? - Where'd you get this? - Why didn't you tell me that Gareth saved your life? I'm not mad. I just, I don't understand. - Well you remember how I said that I lost someone? - She was the one that died in the crash? - Her name was Diana. - Oh, Ian, I am so sorry. I don't have to use this. - No, no, it's okay. Diana would've wanted that. - Are you sure? - Of course. And it's for Gareth. We have to. (sweet music) (kissing) - Thanks. - [Ian] Whatever I can do. (veiled music) - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, where's Gareth? - Oh, Mina asked him to tuck her in. - And he did? - You don't say no to my daughter. You know that. - And we'll read more tomorrow. - One more chapter. - It's already way past your bedtime. - I'm not tired. - How about a night nap spell? - No. - What's up? - I told all my friends that Rolo was going to be at our play date, and I had no idea it was a secret that you were staying with us. - Mm, that stinks. - And now they all think I'm a liar. - That's not okay. Maybe Rolo can do something about that. After all, he does have magic on his side. - Really? - No promises, but if you try to get some shuteye, I'll try to make something happen. - Deal. (gentle music) - Hey. - Hi. Auntie Adrienne. - Can I borrow him? - Yeah, we're good. (Gareth and Adrienne laughing) - Night, Mina. - Thank you. Night. - [Gareth] Good night. Come on buddy, I got you! Ian! - This makes you a hero, Gareth. - Diana still died. - That wasn't your fault, and the public will see it that way. - That's like using the second worst day of my life to make the worst one better. - It's not ideal. I get that. - [Ian] And what if that gets twisted into something negative? - How? You pulled a man out of a burning car at your own peril. Unless there's something you're not telling me. Is there? - No, no no no. Of course not. Why would I lie to you? - All right. I am gonna make sure Nikki Leone gets her dirty little fingers on this. - A source on set the day of his big save tells TMI Today that Gareth Nicks overruled safety experts, insisting the stunt be performed. What's even more interesting, Gareth was widely rumored to be sleeping with Diana Hilzer, the stuntwoman who burned to death in that crash. Coincidence? Or does Gareth simply dispose of women who try to leave him? This is TMI Today, where too much information is just enough. - He lied to me! - Those are just rumors. - You knew about that? - Of course I did. Everyone did. But no one believed them. Least of all me. Look, Gareth would never do something like that. It's ridiculous. - But you're 100% sure he wasn't having an affair with Diana? - You think I'd still be friends with him? That'd make me pretty pathetic, wouldn't it? - Did he pressure you to do the stunt? - Adrienne, Gareth saved my life. He chose my life over Diana's and I can't blame him for that. - No, but you can resent him. - It was my call, okay. I chose to do the stunt. I lost the love of my life. And I took the blame for it. Thanks for reminding me! - I'm sorry, it's just... I never... - No one would hire me in this town after that except for Gareth. He saved my career. - Yeah, I realize that. It's just, look, something is off here. - What, what, what? What's off? What's off? What the hell do you want from me, dammit? What? - Geez. You two are more alike than I thought. - Adrienne! Adrienne, I'm sorry, please! (troubled music) - I can handle those. - It's fine. - You saw the show? - Good guess. Do you even know why I'm helping you? - I know you don't want anyone to know you're helping me. - That's right. I have a business to run and a family to feed. But I'm still here, aren't I? - I appreciate everything you're doing for me, Adrienne. - Really? Did I not ask you very specifically if there was something that I should know? - I'm sorry. I just, I couldn't admit those things. Especially to you. - So it's true. All of it? - Can you let me explain? - It's a little late for that. I'm going to bed. Put those away in the morning. (creepy music) (moves into suspenseful music) (labored breathing) Okay. (scary music) (rustling) (Adrienne screams) - [Gareth] Oh, Jesus! - Gareth? - Don't do that! - [Adrienne] What is that? - What, I thought I heard someone in the house! - [Adrienne] You have a gun? - For protection, yeah. I've got a license. - How long have you had that? - [Gareth] For years, why? - There is a child in this house, Gareth! What if Mina found it? - I've got a trigger lock. - Oh wow. - Hey. Hey! I understand that you're upset, but it's not like I'm being paranoid! Someone was actually trying to kill me! - Yeah, I realize that. I was the one who almost died, remember? - Look, I promise I'll get rid of it. - No. This is way too much for me. You're gonna have to find some other place to stay. I want you gone by tomorrow. (ominous music) You know, I think your daughter has a crush on Juan. - [Emily] (laughs) I know. Wait, how many kids are there? - [Adrienne] Four. - Okay. No no no no no no! - What, a little sugar won't kill them. - Well if there are cookies, why eat anything else? (phone vibrating) (typing) What is it? - Uh, nothing. - Okay, well, I am hiding these. (doorbell rings) (typing) - Coming! Hi! - [Kids] Hi! - Where's Mina? - She will be down in a sec. - [Simone] Okay. - Hi, Juan. - Hi. - [Simone] Mina! - Hi, guys! (moms chatting) - [Simone] Come on, come on, let's go! (eerie music) - [Adrienne] I'll be there in a sec. - [Ramona] Okay. - Do you guys ever call? - I was debating about whether to say anything. - [Adrienne] Say what? - Gareth, he's acting weird, especially about you and Carly. - How so? - He keeps confusing you two. - I don't understand. - He keeps swapping your names out for each other, like, "I can't believe anyone would hurt Adrienne," or, "Carly's so nice to let me stay at her house." It's weird. - He's not staying here anymore. I kicked him out. - Really? When? - Last night. - Well it's, it's probably for the best. I know he's not right. - I don't know, I, I thought that I could help him. - You have helped him. Look, he's a big boy, he can take care of himself. - Well I've gotta... - Just know that I'm here for you. (suspicious music) - That didn't even make it in! - It did too! - I'm totally gonna win this one. - I'm bored! When is Rolo coming? - Yeah, Rolo! - He's gonna be here. - Two in one! - No he's not, because he's not even real! - Be quiet, Juan. - [Hunter] Yeah, be quiet. - Rolo is a sorcerer and you're stupid. - [Gareth] Hello! - [Mina] Rolo! (Mina squeals) - Hello, Mina. - I told you! - [Gareth] How's my newest apprentice? - Good! - Mina, have you been working on your lightning spell? - Yes! - Are there any other young sorcerers among you? - Oh, me, me! - Come on, you guys! (kids laughing) - Hey. - [Gareth] Hi. - [Adrienne] Rolo. - Aunt Adrienne, look who came! - At the behest of sorceress Mina, I'm here to find out, are there any other young sorcerers among you? - Me, me! - Me me me me! - You, over there. - Aw. - Me? - Lucky Juan. - I've heard quite a lot about you. - Bad things? - [Ramona] Everything okay up there? - Uh, yeah, Ramona, everything's fine! Just a bit of roughhousing! All right kids, play date's over. Everybody out. - Aw, Auntie Adrienne, that's not fair! - Downstairs, downstairs, come on, out. - Please! - But Auntie Adrienne! - Everyone downstairs. (Mina groans) What are you doing here? - I promised her. I know it was a risk. I figured if the parents were downstairs... - Come on, Gareth. That was irresponsible. - I know, I know. Sorry. - But I have never seen Mina so happy. Oh, and the look on Juan's face! (Gareth and Adrienne laughing) - I needed that. Do you know how long it's been since I made anyone happy? - Well I'm glad, but I'm still gonna have to ask you to leave. I'm sorry, I know you understand. - Of course I do. - There are times when I see the Gareth that I knew in college, then... - Hey. I get it, I get it. We can't work together. - We can't. But I may still have one last move. We'll see. - Adrienne, I don't want you to do anything that's gonna put you at risk. - I can't help it. It's who I am. (emotional music) Where will you go? - I'll be fine. (somber music) (engine cranking) - [Adrienne] Ramona, someone has information about Carly. - [Ramona] Who? - Well, they wouldn't say. But apparently it's information about Carly that hasn't gone public yet. - Tell me that you're not meeting some deep throat in some parking garage. - Very funny. No. No, they want to meet at a restaurant 20 minutes from Malibu. - I'm going with you. - Seriously? - No arguments. We're early, for Pete's sake. What is the rush? - This guy has been riding me for like the last two miles. Don't freak out, but it looks exactly like Gareth's SUV. - [Ramona] You're kidding me. - Or Ian's. - Are you kidding me? - They drive the same car. - Okay, great. I am not gonna be collateral in your little love triangle here. (car horn honking) - Whoa. (engine revving) (car horn honking) - Whoa. Whoa, whoa whoa whoa! - [Adrienne] What is going... - [Ramona] I, I don't know. (car horn honking) (Adrienne screams) - No no no no no no no! (crashing) - [Mina] Is Auntie Adrienne going to be all right? - [Emily] Yeah, she's gonna be fine, honey. - Look, I think she's waking up. - I think you're right. There she is. So, apparently you're indestructible. No internal bleeding, no broken bones. Just a minor concussion. - Where's Ramona? - Ah ah ah, don't you move. I'll find out, okay? - If you get band-aids, can I have some? - Mina. - What? - Mommy can take you to the nurse's station. I'm sure they have plenty. - Can we, please? - I'll be right back. I love you, sis. - Love you. (veiled music) (Adrienne grunts) Nurse, excuse me? Simone? Hey, Simone? Hey, honey? Is your mom in there? - She's sleeping. But she won't wake up, even when I ask her to. - Honey, she will wake up. She'll be all right. She'll wake up. - You promise? - I promise. (elevator dings) - Hey. I got here as fast as I could. - What are you doing here? - I had to see you. What did the doctors say? - Ramona is in a coma. - Oh my god, I'm so sorry. - Why? - What are you talking about? - [Detective Phelps] Miss Kleiner, it's Detective Phelps. May I come in? - Come in! - Hi. - [Detective Phelps] Detective Phelps. We spoke at Phil Navarro's. - [Adrienne] I remember. - How are you feeling? - Like I was just in a car crash. Did you find the driver yet? - Not yet, but we're on it. I assure you. Let me ask you a question. Uh, where were you headed when, uh, the collision occurred? - Earlier that morning, someone had text me about Carly's murder from an unknown number. We were gonna meet them at a restaurant north of Malibu. - And you trusted that they were, uh, telling the truth? - Yeah, they knew that Carly had been cheating on Gareth. Gareth and I are the only people who could possibly have known that. - [Detective Phelps] Why is that? - Because Gareth had just told me a few days ago, and I am assuming it wasn't Carly that was texting me, clearly. - Right. - You know what I think? I think that they were gonna tell me that Carly's lover murdered her. - We've already looked into that. - And? It's confidential. - [Detective Phelps] Yeah, for the time being. - All I know is the car that hit us is the exact model that Gareth Nicks drives. It had been tailgating us for miles before it hit us. - [Patient] Wait, I know you! - Sh! - I will not be shushed, young man! - How about this? - [Patient] Ah, keep 'em coming! Yeah, oh boy! (laughs) Thank you! (laughs) - Interesting. So uh, Gareth Nicks, huh? - Uh-huh. - Well, that's a start. Any idea where he is? - Hiding. - Of course, right. Well, if you see him, you'll call us, right? - You can count on it. Gareth. Gareth. Gareth! - A gift from Rolo! - Hey Adrienne, we're home. Oh my god, is that who I think it is? - Hey! - It's Ian! What is he doing here? Did you, did you tell him to come here? - Of course not. - Emily! Listen, I just, I'd like to talk to Adrienne. - Look, Ian, it's really not a great time. - [Ian] I just need to talk to Adrienne. - Auntie Adrienne, what's going on? - It's about Gareth, okay? - Don't worry. - [Emily] And FYI, you're trespassing. - It's about Gareth. - Everything will be okay. - All right, Adrienne. - Ian. - [Ian] Are you okay? - Ian, what do you want? - [Ian] Look, it's about Gareth. He came to my house last night. He was, he was spiraling, and I think this time he's out of control. - He's a big boy. You said it yourself. - Yes, I know, but he came to my house last night. His car was demolished, the entire back end demolished. - Enough! - Em, wait, let him finish. - Thank you. Thank you. Look, he's done this before. He's gotten plastered, he's come to my place, his car is totaled, he brings it to my place, I got a guy that can repair it and he takes care of it discreetly. All right? But I swear he's done this before, and last night he did it again. - Last night? - Yes, last night. - All right. All right, Ian, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. - Okay, okay, I'm going, but please, Adrienne, stay away from Gareth. I'm convinced now that he's dangerous. Please. (suspicious music) - I hired Marsh and Marsh. From the looks of your face, you haven't seen it? - What? - You should've told me. - Gareth Nicks struck again last night as he's suspected of ramming his SUV into the car of his PR rep, Adrienne Kleiner, and her mentor, the legendary Ramona Woodbury. Ramona is in a coma. Adrienne's status is unconfirmed. But as it turns out, Adrienne was more than his rep. The two were college sweethearts, reunited after Carly's death. And apparently, the two shacked up together less than a week after the murder. Can you say pure evil? And why did Adrienne think she'd fare any better than his wife or that poor stuntwoman? When you try to charm a snake, you just might get bit, Adrienne. This has been TMI. - True or false? - It's true. All of it. - Why didn't you tell me he was your client? It's not like it never came up. - You're right, I should have. - Look, this wasn't an easy decision for me. I really like you. It's just I gotta be able to trust you. - I get it. - I gotta ask you, why did you help him? I mean, when the rest of the world knew he did it? - History. We had history. - You loved him. - Oh boy. Yeah, at one point. And I don't know, maybe, but there was something else, something that I can't explain. - Well, what is it? - This stays here, you promise? - Promise. - Someone tried to kill Gareth. - You know this for sure? - I was there. You see, they had rigged his car to be like this, this death trap, but I was the one that got trapped, and Gareth, he saved my life. - Wow. I didn't see that one coming. Wait a minute. Why keep that a secret? I mean, isn't that all the proof you would need? - You're right. Okay. Thank you! Thank you. ♪ Peanut butter and jelly the things I like to eat ♪ ♪ Peanut butter and jelly the things are perfect for me ♪ ♪ I have peanut butter and jelly in the middle of... ♪ (doorbell rings) (eerie music) - Hey, kiddo. - Where'd you go? - Hey, is your Auntie Adrienne home? - [Mina] Don't know where she is. - How about your mom? - Sleeping. - Can I come inside? - Sure.

Honey, how would you feel about staying the night at Simone's? - Is something wrong? - I am gonna make everything all right. I promise! Come on. (serious music) (knocking on door) Ian? What are you doing? - Adrienne, get inside. - [Adrienne] Ian! - [Gareth] Adrienne, help! - [Ian] You're alone? - [Adrienne] Yeah, but Gareth left a note! - You need to come in here. Just listen to me! (muffled screaming) You just need to listen to me. - Oh my god. Gareth. Emily! Oh my god! - Gareth drugged her. - Why? - No! - I was worried about you. I went to your house. I walked up to the front door, and I saw this bastard carrying Emily's limp body in his arms. I thought she was dead, Adrienne. - Why wouldn't you stop him, Ian? - I thought you were in the house. I went in there searching for you. I looked everywhere! I thought that he killed you too! And then I found the note and I came here. I tried to warn you, Adrienne. I tried to warn you. - Ian. I am so sorry. (tense music) Ian. (Gareth grunts) (suspenseful music) I'm calling the police. - No, wait! (muffled screaming) No no no, wait wait. No, you can't, okay? No, he's gonna blame it all on me. - I will tell the truth! - No, no, you can't do that. Okay, it'll be his word against mine. No, you can't. - Well then what can I do? Look, I just want this all to end. (twisted music) (muffled screaming) - Adrienne, no! - Adrienne. - What? - Look, it'll be self-defense. I'll be your witness. - No. - Adrienne. - No! - Look at what he did to Emily. - [Gareth] I didn't do that! - Ramona may never wake up. Adrienne, if I didn't stop him, he would've killed you right here. - No! - Adrienne! He's a murderer! - No! - [Gareth] I wouldn't do that to you! - What are you waiting for? - I'm sorry. - Do it! (dramatic music) (muffled screaming) God! You know, I am so disappointed! I thought there was something between us. Ah, but you know, I was just probably being naive, like always. (Adrienne screams) (muffled screaming) - What? Oh my god. - Aw. Yeah, it was a test. And guess what? You failed. - [Gareth] Run! Run now! - He stole the love of my life. All Diana wanted to do was please him. Yeah, that's why she did that impossible stunt. And who got the blame for it, huh, who, who? Yep, not this guy. Then, you know, Carly, she started flirting with me. Yeah, well, anyway, Gareth, uh, you know, I just figured tit for tat. - You killed Carly! - So you killed her? (muffled screaming) You killed Carly? - What do you think you're doing? - [Ian] Yes, Adrienne, I killed Carly. (Gareth screams) - [Carly] I'm not having this conversation. - [Ian] Now he knows what it's like to lose someone you love and get blamed for it! - [Adrienne] And Phil Navarro too? - Oh. (Gareth screams) No choice, a loose end. (sharp thudding) (Gareth screams) Fortunately, Nikki Leone came to the rescue and pinned another murder on my old friend. You know, if Gareth had just gotten in the car that night instead of you, it all would've been wrapped up in a tight little bow. And then there was you. You. (car horn honking) All you wanted to do was just (crashing) protect him, save his name, clear his reputation! - But why seduce me? - Adrienne! Isn't it obvious? Trust, loyalty. You know, I wanted you to believe me, not this guy. - I never really trusted you, Ian. - What are you talking about? - Gareth's SUV, it never left his garage. It didn't even have a scratch on it. The note, maybe the guy that I thought I knew really did lose his mind. Do you have any idea how many love letters Gareth wrote to me when we were still together? Letters that I've still kept all these years later. Gareth wrote in all caps, Ian. It's all those little details. So I called Nikki Leone, told her everything, knowing that she would jump at the chance to cover the final chapter in Hollywood's most talked-about murder mystery, live. Say hello to Nikki Leone and her 50 million fans. We're live, remember. Don't get shy on me. - No. (sirens wailing) (Gareth shouts) (body thuds) (sirens wailing) (tires squealing) (punching) (grunting) (Gareth groans) - Police! - Okay. - You're fine, you're fine.
