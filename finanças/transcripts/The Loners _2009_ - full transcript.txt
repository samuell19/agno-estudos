Bye, see you. Shabbat Shalom. Do you have my beret? - Yes. Take care of it. - You sure you won't come? My mom'll be happy, my sister too. Thanks. Next time. - OK. - Bye. Glori, get up! We have to celebrate. Celebrate? I have guard duty, I need my sleep. Dumb Kavkaz, I was accepted to officer training and we're gonna celebrate! You, my commander? Officer! You speak Russian? - Yes. Why won't he let me in? - You can't go in. - Why? Private party. - Private? You can't go in, that's that. Why? - Because. What's wrong? Damn! Private party again? - I've had it. Want me to get you in? No problem, I'll get us in. - Forget it Glori. Let's go. It's beneath me. How 'bout we try one more time? I stay here any longer, there'll be trouble for sure. Let's go! Desk clerks. You have reached the home of General Bluchin, please leave a message. General Bluchin? I'm pleased to inform you your son is going to officer training. I'll be an Israeli officer, Dad! I'll be an officer! Here is commander Alex Sasha Shora Bluchin, Platoon stand at attention, 2,3... - Attention! To the best combat fighter in Golani and in the IDF! To my friend Glori Cambell! Cheers! To friendship! Now, you can't whine to the welfare officer: "Poor me, I'm a lone soldier, I have no money..." You're no longer a lone soldier, you're an officer. Can you lend me some money? I wanna try again. You think you can get in? - You said it's beneath you. I see. - What? Wanna come with me? Come. Forget it, I'll hitch a ride, I'm up for guard duty. How much do you need? Will that do? Thanks. Bye then! Take care! OK, bye! Everything's messed up Whores get fucked for money, Golani for free I don't want a cat I want pussy The drunk is lured by wine You're lured by dick Everything's messed up Whores get fucked for money, Golani for free... Weapons at 60 degrees! - Weapons at 60 degrees! Remove cartridge! - Remove cartridge! Dismantle arms for inspection. - Dismantle arms for inspection. Dismissed. Bluchin, you stay. I need you. Bluchin, give me your rifle. - Is something wrong, Sir? I hope not. Wait here, Bluchin. Glori Cambell? We'll tell them it was stolen. - No Russian, I said! Over 5,0005.56 mm bullets, 200 MAG machine gun munition rounds, 20 hand grenades, One FN Belgian pistol, a shortened M16 rifle Sgt. Bluchin signed for. A search was conducted and the stolen pistol was found among Sgt. Cambell's belongings. They also found another M16 in Sgt. Bluchin's possession. The other weapons and munitions that were stolen from the armory have disappeared. Sgt. Bluchin, did you sell the M16 you signed for? No. - How did it reach the Hamas? - I don't know. We didn't sell arms to Hamas, we're soldiers! My rifle was stolen. I was afraid to say anything. We took one from the armory. We didn't sell arms, we're soldiers, what's this about? The shortened M16 Sasha Bluchin signed for that was used by terrorists to kill 5 people in Hadera. That's what this is about. What are you talking about? Sasha's rifle was stolen. Stolen, I tell you! Your honor, the prosecution didn't tell defense about the attack. I ask we be given the material so we can prepare a defense. Hey, stop crying. They'll think we're guilty. We'll be OK. Hey, ease off! You're here! Good evening. All the officers wanted you for themselves, but I lucked out. You'll have a great time, take Galperin's word. To the company. Don't leave my side. That cop won't break us. Same company, same platoon, stay close to me. I see you didn't get it, you stinkin' traitor! Who're you calling 'traitor'? You think this is a hotel? Take him to the spa. Stupid Kavkaz! I won't forget you! Bastard! Desk clerks! Slackers! We got a garbage delivery unlike anything I've known. Traitors. Sorry for putting this scum in with you losers. You're a disgrace to IDF. Bunch of failures! Garbage! Bluchin! - Yes, Sir? Stand on one leg, Bluchin. - What did I do, Sir? I said, lift your leg. You should be grateful IDF was nice enough to let you stay in one of its finest prisons. Any other army would've sent you to Siberia, to dig up rocks and eat snow. "Isolation Unit" You'd be better off in many respects. In civilian prison there's TV, activities and much better conditions. - I'm a soldier! You're sentenced to 4 years. The army can't keep you in prison for so long. - I'm a soldier! Sasha, the army doesn't want you. What? If you don't want civilian prison, then... What do you mean, "the army doesn't want me"? We can appeal. You want to appeal? Yes, I want to appeal. - Fine, let's appeal. Write down why you don't want to be in civilian prison and... sign here. I think you should reconsider. You wouldn't want to stay in a military prison for4 years. What about a retrial? Talk to your lawyer. Lawyer?! Some kid they assigned to us 2 days before the trial. I think it'll be easier to get a retrial from civil prison. Don't you get it? This was a military trial and the army should retry me. - Sasha, fill out the forms, please. Get dressed, Glori. - What for? You're leaving isolation. - Already? Galperin's orders. You leaving isolation, Hamasnik? Haven't you learned anything? Need more homework? My friends heard what happened. Watch your back! Motherfucker! Traitor! Piece of shit! How are you? Fine. They hassle you when I was gone? - I managed. You did okay? - I can manage on my own. Glori! - What? - Stay calm. Excuse me, that's my bed. Find another one. - I've been here a week. You just got here, you find another bed. You know who that is? The traitor. Why'd you have to mess with Galperin? I wanted to teach him a lesson. All of them. Why d'you care what that jerk says? They keep calling you 'traitor', you'll start believing it! 27, 28, 29, 30. 31... Hey, ladies! Leave the fondling for night time. 33. 34... - Koskas, another 50. 1... - Don't fuck with me, Galperin! Say it in Hebrew, Cambell. Make me! Lift your leg. Like your girlfriend, lift your leg! Koskas, another 50. 1, 2, 3, 4... Company D, dismissed! Cambell, you stay here. Bardugo, gimme a light. - I don't have a light. There you go... Who's winning? I'm winning. 6-1. I'll make you my dog yet Cambell. Stay down! I don't give a fuck about you. Don't speak Russian to me, you soil the language. Don't worry, we'll have lots of quality time. Glori? Wake up! Glori Cambell? You were sentenced to 4 years, the army can't hold you for so long. Only me, or Sasha too? - Both of you. What did Sasha say? Sasha wants to appeal. Me too. - I think you should reconsider. I want to appeal too. - OK, if you don't want civil prison, write down why you appeal and sign below. Write what Sasha wrote, please. I asked for an appeal too. Why shouldn't we move to a civil prison? Move if you want, we don't have to stay together. - He's coming! To receive the commander, stand at attention. 2, 3... - Attention! Cambell, the commander's here. Can't you stand at attention? Only you, Cambell. Red... To receive the commander, stand at attention. 2, 3... Attention! What were you tried for, soldier? - Refusing a command. 21 days, Sir. Sir, excuse me, Sir! We had a military trial, we're soldiers. We should be in a military prison. Who said that? - Me, Sir. Combatant Sasha Bluchin, 12th regiment, Golani, Sir! - You should've thought about that before you sold arms to the Hamas. - I didn't, Sir, we submitted an appeal, Sir. - Tell me, soldier, you think it's right addressing me like this during roll call? Sir, we asked to see you a month ago. Our request didn't go through. Cambell, watch your back. For the departure of the commander, attention. 2,3... - Attention! "We had a military trial." "My name is Sasha Bluchin. "12th regiment, Golani..." Why did you say I could go to civil prison alone? You want civil prison, go to civil prison. All you do is get me in trouble. - I get you in trouble? I bet you don't last one day without me! Why didn't you stand at attention? He'll never see us now. If I stood at attention, would he see us? Don't be a child, Sasha! Don't be a child! Why hasn't he seen us till now? What's your problem? - Shut up and keep working! Get on with it! Everyone's a boss! - Fuck these potatoes! Who's coming to prayer service? Thank goodness. - Come on! Come on, it's nearly Sabbath. We'll drink wine, praise the Lord! Hey Red, where're you going? - To temple, he's religious. Red has discovered God. - IDF directive: You can't keep a prisoner from attending prayer service. Anyone who wants to pray, must be allowed to. There's wine? Never mind, we have a quorum. Koskas? Peace unto you, angels of peace Heavenly angels... Back to work! Shit! Glori, we gotta get outta here. - Go! Run! What's up Glori? Piece of shit! Hamasnik! Traitor! Garbage, Hamasnik! We'll teach you a lesson, traitor! - Who you calling a traitor? Motherfucker! Come on, Hamasnik! Get him down! - Get him down! Down! Shut your mouth! We'll show you! Bastard! I want my lawyer! You hear me? I have a right to see my lawyer! You motherfucker! What about my retrial? I want my lawyer! What about my retrial? - Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid, we'll get out! We're together, don't be scared! We'll get outta here, Sasha! Sir, it's beneath me to be in the same jail with them, Sir! Galperin, you bastard! - Sir! Galperin, come get your fuckin' girlfriend, Galperin! Galperin! Sasha! Sasha? Sasha! You alone in the cell? - Yes. I'm stuck here with some jerk. Sasha, what d'you say? It's my fault, OK? My fault. My fault you're here! That's what you want to hear? There, I said it: My fault. What more do you want me to do? You're nothing but trouble. Sasha! Sitting in jail, thinking thinking of you, mother feeling the pain a teardrops like a diamond want to see my mother not only in my dreams... Alex! Go to sleep, damn it! Hi. I have something for you, Glori. Your IDF discharge, you're a civilian. Read it and sign, OK? Someone'll come get it. Good morning, Sasha. Did we get a retrial? - No, I'm sorry, Sasha, the appeal failed, but you were discharged. You're better off, believe me. In civilian prison you'll have much better conditions. - We're soldiers. You'll be able to work on a retrial, even get your own lawyer. - Our own lawyer? We don't have money for a lawyer. Sign it and they'll come get it. Sasha, in civil prison we'll have a TV, showers, we'll be in one cell. We'll hire a lawyer who?ll get us a retrial. It's best, Sasha. You know what'll happen to me in a civil prison? You'll be OK, but me? Those are real criminals. You know what they'll do to me? Fuck me up the ass, you get it, Glori? I'm finished! I'll be with you. I don't want you to protect me, don't you see? I don't want civil prison! You don't? Then we'll stay here. As if anyone's asking you! Sasha, I swear. You wanna stay here, we'll stay here. Yeah, right. What'll you do, pull strings? Don't be scared, I'm with you. Sasha... Get in bed. What? - Get in bed, under the covers. - What? Under the covers! Damn it! You're sick. You hear me? - I'm sick? - Exactly. You have a contagious disease. - I'm sick, I'm sick. Real contagious. I'm sick. - Right. Very contagious disease. Guard! What is it, Cambell? He's sick, Sir. Fever, rash, diarrhea... I'll get a doctor. - Sir, let me out, he'll infect me. Sir... Sir, I'm sick. I'll get the doctor. He'll move him to isolation. Do me a favor, Sir, let me out, I'll get sick. Sir, I'm sick. Please, Sir, let me out. Guard, I don't feel well either. Now we're together, bro. Sir, I need a mattress. So appeal! - Sir, I need a mattress! Who cares about those soldiers? Let 'em drop dead! You're no officer, you're a virus! You asleep? - You see the irony? I was scared he'd find out how I lost my weapon, now he thinks I'm a traitor, now that I'm not a soldier, he'd rather see me dead. Cut the crap, Sasha. I mean it, he wishes I was dead. You know what it means to be a General's son? Forget about it. Sasha, what's 'irony' mean? Irony? It's being so scared your dad will know you were a bad soldier, then it turns out he believes you sold 50 grenades and 5,000 bullets to the Hamas because you have a moron friend, a Kavkaz freak who doesn't know what irony means. That's irony! You see why I love you? You're so good at explaining. Why've you never told me how it was with her? Was she pretty? I'm not your dad, not a General, why don't you answer? He hasn't spoken to me since then. It'll be OK, Sasha. You said that last time and look what happened. Civil prison, that's what. OK ladies, let's go. On the double, outside in pairs! Where're the Hamasniks, Sir? The Russians stay here. - OK. What is this? Stop whistling. I said stop whistling! How is he? I don't feel well, Sir, I think Shalom infected me. He didn't infect you, he's fine. Glori, let me out. - Glori, that's enough! OK, I got it, open up! You can't tell me what to do anymore, I'm a civilian. Open up or I'll call for backup. We're dangerous prisoners, didn't they tell you? Hey, let me outta here! Bluchin, tell him to let me out. Glori, leave him alone! - Fuck you! I'm letting you go and you won't say a word. Let's go! - What're you doing? - What am I doing? What d'you want? You wanna go to civil prison? We'll go to civil prison. Keep an eye on him. Keep an eye on him, OK? One word outta you, Sasha'll bash your brains in. And I'll finish off what's left of you, OK? Sasha, they'll hang you for this. We're two separate people. Don't you get it? You gotta convince him. Otherwise, you'll hang too. Listen, I'm my own person, OK? He keeps nagging me about it. Besides, his mom comes out of mourning tomorrow. So? Let him go home on Thursday. You want to let him leave? You take care of it. I will. What're you doing?! Leave him alone! You'll kill him! What're you doing?! What're you doing, Hamasnik? Quiet! Listen up, I'm... your new commander. - Yes, Sir! You got that? I'm the commander now. Sasha, I need you. What're you doing? - What am I doing? What I always do, I'm saving your ass! They'll kill us! You prefer filing an appeal? Here's the welfare officer. File another appeal. You're both crazy. - Why 'both'? You see me doing anything? You're both in trouble, you have no idea! - Why 'both'? I'm sorry, OK? I thought you'd be better off in a civil prison. - You thought? But you didn't ask us what we want. Maybe we think differently? - OK, I understand. I can appeal your military discharge. Give me a chance! Maybe a special committee will hear us. You can't arrange for a special committee. You discharged us. We aren't soldiers, remember? Boy, are you guys fucked! Sasha, you coming? You coming or not? I need your help. I'll say you're a hostage, you didn't do a thing. It's all me. You coming or not? Catch! You show them, Glori! Sasha, give me the keys before you get in too deep. Bluchin, give her the keys. If I give you the keys, what'll you do for us? I'll try to do whatever I can to help. Give me the keys. - The truth, will I get a retrial? I'll do my best... - Yes or no? Glori, you jerk! I knew you'd come, motherfucker! You came to your Kavkaz father? Yes, but don't forget I'm your hostage, OK? OK. Come here. I have a plan. Sit down. "To the prison commander, "Lt. Col. Sha'ashua. "We are combatants Glori Cambell "and Sasha Bluchin, Golani, 12th regiment." You said just Glori, no? OK, just Glori. "We have hostages. "We won't release them "until you cancel our transfer to civil prison. - In a retrial. "If in the retrial "we are found..." What is it in Hebrew? Not guilty. "If in the retrial we are found not guilty, "we ask for a guarantee "we will be returned to Golani 12th regiment." You joking or what? You don't believe your Kavkaz father. Keep writing. They'll kill you. I swear, they'll kill you. Guard! - Undress. I said undress. Take your shirt off. Now your pants. Pants? Why pants! Take off your pants. We're sending you on a very important mission. Give this to the prison commander. What're you looking at? - Move, damn it! Guards! That bastard. Guards! That fuckin' traitor! He showed you! You'll pay, all of you! You'll pay for this! What d'you think'll happen after they read your letter? Our letter, Sasha, our letter. If soldiers storm in with weapons, what'll you say? "He wrote it, not me"? You think they distinguish between Glori and Sasha? Him we'll shoot, him we won't? - So what'll we do? - What'll we do? Urban warfare. You're a Golani fighter. Urban warfare. - Urban warfare? - Not a problem! Come here. Fill this up. Only half, so it doesn't explode in your hands. - Explode? What's it for? Don't you know? It's a Molotov, our grandfathers' weapon. Commanders, roll call drill. - They got our letter. Come. - Commanders, roll call drill. I repeat, roll call, gather the prisoners in the yard. Guards, gather the prisoners in the yard for roll call. I repeat, this is a drill, gather all prisoners in the yard... Answer it! - You answer! No, you answer. I'll tell you what to say. Answer it! They hung up. Say 'hello'. - Hello? - Who is this? He's asking who this is. - Tell him your name. This is Glori Cambell. - I said tell him your name! What's going on there Glori? - We, we have... Tell him we want a retrial. We want a retrial, Sir! - Who's 'we'? Combatants Sasha Bluchin and Glori Cambell, Golani 12th regiment, want a retrial, Sir. Tell him we have hostages, the welfare officer too. OK. We can arrange it. - You'll arrange a retrial? Yes. Come out now and I'll arrange a retrial. He agrees. What d'you mean 'agrees'? He agrees to retry us. Just like that? Agrees? - Lf we come out now, he'll arrange a retrial. Tell him they shouldn't move us to a civil prison. They shouldn't move us to a civil prison, Sir. You come out now and I won't move you to a civil prison. He says OK. - OK? Hello, listen up, we're Glori Cambell and Sasha Bluchin. We demand to speak to... Who's higher up than him? What're you doing? He said he agrees! What am I doing? If we come out now, he puts us in a van, takes us to civil prison and no one'll be the wiser. Who's higher up than him? Ben Aruya. - We demand to speak to General Ben Aruya. If he doesn't come to speak to us face to face, we won't free the hostages. - You listen to me Cambell, if you think I... He's playing us for fools. What're you doing? Keep away! Keep away! Now you speak Russian? I'm no longer dirtying your language? I throw one match and you're all goners! Let's go. I said let's go! Let go of my hand! - Shut up! I won't shut up! - Shut up I said! Let go of my hand! Yes? - Listen to me... - Hold on commander. Talk. If you think a nobody like you... - Hello? Ilanit?! - Yes, Sir. - What's going on there? They poured kerosene over Galperin and he's all beat up, Sir. He must see a doctor! - How many of you are in there? Did you hear her? We're animals, Sir, we sold arms to the Hamas. Get your General here now! Wow! That was quick! Where's our food? I'm hungry. You have any idea who Ben Aruya is? You're screwed. Where's the food? Sasha! They killed me. - What's doing? Idiot. What're you doing? - Food! Everyone's hungry. You should be thinking about what you'll tell him. First, I ask him for 2 Russian girls then I ask him to talk to us. Glori, seriously, he'll be here soon. You know about these things. Don't you, Sasha? Why don't you tell me what she was like? Don't you see this is serious? Ben Aruya is coming, do you even know who he is? Who's Ben Aruya? His Dad was a great fighter in the 101st. What about his Mom? "Don't touch, property of Sgt. Galperin" Here, enjoy! What's this? - Galperin's CD. Galperin's? - Galperin's. The toys went to sleep The guards too... The blankets... Tanks await backup... In myths we skate on the moon and gallop into a rainbow and befriend an elephant and grab a bird's feather close your eyes Bye, bye, bye. Anything else, anyone? Sir! Yaacobi's here to deal with the hostage situation. That's what we have here. - Sir! Ready? - Yes, 2 mins. You realize these are soldiers, right? Yes, they poured kerosene and injured a guard. They could burn down the building. - Didn't you vacate it? Not yet, but I don't think they'll burn it down. What you think is irrelevant, Sha'ashua. We've got to gain entry now, Benny. When this fiasco hits the media... - Take it easy, hot head, do you have their profiles? - At headquarters. Be ready. - Yes, Sir! Glori? Glori! What? - I have to pee. Pee here. - I can't with all these men around. Come on... I have to go. I can't do it here. That's the best I can do. Would it kill you to take me to the staff latrine? The latrine is now a war zone. What? Don't get any ideas. - Me? Don't you get any ideas! You happy now, you're the prison commander. Poor Bluchin, I bet you convinced him to sell arms to Hamas, right? Sasha Bluchin, Glori Cambell... Come on. - Wait. - Come on! - Sasha Bluchin, Glori Cambell... Sasha Bluchin, Glori Cambell, This is Gen. Ben Aruya. You asked to speak to me. Sasha Bluchin, Glori Cambell, this is Gen. Ben Aruya. I know you can hear me. I know you want a retrial. I know you want to be soldiers again. I respect that. You see? - What I don't respect, is what you're doing right now. It's called 'soldier abduction'. There's no honor in that. You're infantry men, you know what has to be done in an abduction situation. The army doesn't negotiate with abductors. Come out now, say you're sorry, I'll make sure the army overlooks this shameful story. You have 30 mins to come out. 30 minutes. Glori, let's stop this, we can't take them. Get real! In war, few odds, in this battle, good odds! You know what soldier abduction procedure is? Sasha, they won't shoot us! - How do you know? No way they'll shoot at IDF soldiers! You got a light? - You insane? I'm not throwing it at them! Not at them. You throw it before they enter, so they don't come in! You have a light or not? - Yes. Light it! Make sure they're not wet. Here. What's going on, Glori? Hey Glori, what's going on? Yaacobi, this isn't a standard soldier abduction situation. You said this is the only procedure. Cool it. I'm warning you! These are IDF soldiers. They sold arms to Hamas. - Hot head, take it easy. The fact this is unprecedented, doesn't mean I want a dead man. Is that clear? Is that clear? - Clear. I want a clean job. No more inquiries than we've already had. You have less than a minute to come out. When they get close, you light it and throw. Clear? Clear? Take it. Perhaps I didn't make myself clear. If you're not out in 30 secs we're coming in. Yuval, go in! Guys, blankets over your heads, quick! Where's your blanket? Over your head. Shalom, blanket over your head! Quick! Alex, blanket over your head. Cover your heads, there'll be smoke grenades, you hear me? - Yes. - Blankets over your heads! Cease fire! What's going on? They're throwing Molotovs at my soldiers! Hold your fire. Hold your fire! Glori! Hold your fire. Yaacobi, over here. Glori? Glori, you alright? Glori? Glori, look at me! Idiot! Why do you always fuck things up? Look at me, keep your eyes open! Lift your head! What are you doing? They almost killed me, mother fuckers! Why do I listen to you? Why can't I learn not to listen to you? Why? Tell me why! The General will take us seriously. Now he'll negotiate. Sure, soon he'll call and ask if we're hungry. What'd you like to eat? I feel like Ravioli. On second thought, I want a green salad. You don't believe me when I'm telling you he'll call? Glori, I'm leaving. You coming? What? - I'm leaving. Enough. You leave now, it's 4 years in civil prison for mutiny. You instigated it, not me! You think they care? - I'll help you up. Glori and Sasha, if you don't answer me, I'll assume you were hit, we'll enter with medical aid. Glori and Sasha, I assume you were hit, we're entering with medical aid. Glori Cambell and Sasha Bluchin demand a retrial! We have hostages, we won't release them till you retry us! We won't release them till you retry us! Get me any info you've got. I want to talk to their regiment commanders. I want to know if they saw the mental health officer, I want to talk to their parents... Glori has no parents, he's an orphan. Sasha's father's in Russia. Get him. Are the buses here? - On the way. Wake up, Sha'ashua, wake up. Let's write another letter. It'll begin like this: "One: "We won't be tried for mutiny. "Two: We get a retrial, "and a real lawyer this time. "Three..." - Arrivederci! "If we're found innocent, we demand to rejoin our regiment, "the 12th. Four: "Gen. Ben Aruya will promise to approve our demands. "When he agrees we'll release the hostages and surrender. "Glori Cambell, Sasha Bluchin, 12th regiment combatants." "12th regiment combatants..." Golani, shit heads! Give me 30 minutes, I'll bring them to you. Out! Glori! Hurry up! Way to go, Golani! They're evacuating the prison. - Good, now they'll have no problem killing us. We made history, Sasha. - History? Let's surrender! People heard our story. The press will interview us. You'll tell your story to the press? Say where you lost your rifle? - Lf I do, will it help? What's up, honey? Come, we'll give you... Whore! Galperin, you bastard! I'm gonna see what's going on. Stop it! Do something! I can't hear you. - Do something, stop them! It's dangerous! Enough. Hello? - Who's this?- Sasha. Sasha Bluchin, Gen. Ben Aruya. Your father?s on his way. Hold on. Death to the guards! Death to the guards! What's she doing here? Why're you so wound up? Glori, we're walking out. You won't leave until you get a bullet to the head. Am I right? You wanna go, go. I'm leaving. You know what your problem is? You have no boundaries. That's why you get in trouble. Why did you throw a Molotov at a soldier? Why? - Yes, why? For you! - For me?! Did I ask to throw a Molotov at a soldier?! Do I want to avoid civil prison?! First you whine like a pussy then I save your ass, and you run like a pussy. You know what our problem is? You have no balls! If you had balls, we wouldn't be here! Fine. - Exactly. It's my fault you stole half the armory? Sgt. Bluchin, you owe us the truth. Where did you lose your rifle, Sgt. Bluchin? Don't you see it wouldn't help even if I told? Where'd you lose it? Where're the grenades you took from the armory, Sgt. Cambell? Where did you lose your rifle? Shut up! - Tell me! Tell me! I lost it when I was with a whore, OK? Good. How was she? Son of a bitch! - Is that why you're in prison? - Son of a bitch! Did I hear right? He lost it when he was with a whore? Shut up! - We're here because of me! You idiots got 4 years because he wouldn't say he was with a whore? Shut up your mouth! - I won't shut up my mouth! You don't even say 'shut up your mouth' in Hebrew! Either 'be quiet' or 'shut up'... Bastard! You see what I'm talking about? Sasha, Sasha... Did he promise you a retrial? - For both of us. Both of us? What about the mutiny? The mutiny's on me? My Dad's on his way. OK. - OK? Farewell, brother. Stop! Hands up! Remove your shirt! Slowly! Good. Undershirt. Slowly! Hands up! Now do as I say, no sudden moves. Take off your pants. Slowly. I said slowly! On your stomach! - On your stomach! How many Molotovs does he have? - Where's my father?

"Sir, "I, Glori Slava, was a MAG fighter "in 12th regiment Golani. "In all the company "there was no MAG fighter than me." - No better one than me! "No better one than me. "My mother's Jewish, "my father's not. "I came to Israel alone, "to enlist in the IDF. "Saturdays everyone went home, "and whoever had to stay on duty would pay me to replace him. "It was real boring "to guard all day. "So I did shooting practice "to improve my soldiering skills, "and when I was out of ammo, I procured what I needed. "I found the key to the armory..." - You "found"? You stole it! Write "found". "I found..." "then I took an RPG "and fired. "The next week I took grenades and blow them up." -Blew them up! "Blew them up. "General Sir, "there's no better fighter than me in the IDF. "When Sasha Bluchin lost his rifle - "I won't say where, "he can tell you if he wants - "I took him to the armory and said: 'choose! ' "General Sir, "Sasha Bluchin didn't mean to steal a rifle.

There's a guard inside! Everyone down! - Everyone down! Open the door! Open the door! You see this? Go get Gen. Ben Aruya. You won't let me go home, Cambell? I thought you don't negotiate. They said you wanna see me. Glori! Don't call me Glori. You won't do it. - Why not? I just know you won't do it. I don't know, and you do? I'm opening the door and coming in. Go. Go. You're free! What now? What d'you want? Sasha Bluchin didn't instigate a mutiny. He was my hostage. - OK, I got that. It'll be resolved at the trial. Let's go. - Gen. Ben Aruya, you must promise me Sasha Bluchin wasn't involved. I gave my word to my friend, Sasha, who was my hostage, and Sasha trusts me. Sorry, it's out of my hands. - Gen. Ben Aruya, give me your word! The word of a combat fighter! I wanted to be the best combatant. I wanted to be remembered. They'll remember you, believe me. - For what? For mutiny in an army prison? The way I see it, best they remember you for mutiny in prison than for selling arms to Hamas. - The way you see it. That's the problem, it's always the way you people see it.
