This documentary follows the making of Lars von Trier's Dogma film THE IDIOTS Lars von Trier recorded a diary, which was made available for this film The idea originates from a time when I had a summer cottage - - near something called Marjatta. I don't know if you know it - - but it's an institution. A mental institution or home. They follow a guy named Steiner's theory. They think of mongols as angels. They say they are a gift to Mankind. This is what it's all based on. The fact that they are a gift. Hello, we are from a commune for the mentally handicapped. - We're selling Christmas decorations. - How much? - How much are they, Ped? - £600. And 50 pence. - They cost £2. - Pop inside and get £2. - And 50 pence and 50 pence. - And 50 pence. Let's hope it lasts. We've debased ourselves enough in this shitty district. - Cobbles? - Look. They're too high. The retards were out selling and fell over. This one's too high too. - Sulker sulker. - Is anybody hurt? "Is anybody hurt?" - You've ruined it for them. - What do they cost? - £4 a piece. - And 50 pence. You forgot one. Why the humiliation? No wonder head cases get a distorted view of reality. THE HUMILIATED - This is Luis. - Yes, I can see that. - My name is Nikolaj. - Hello. Please take a seat and have something to drink. - Are you going to film everything? - Just some of it. - Beginnings and endings. - Yes. - You can't drink red wine from that. - An ordinary glass will do. Have you talked about the dogma rules? No, there's no reason to. It's based on technical rules which e.g. don't allow us to mix the sound. Just cut it. The story begins and ends with Karen, played by Bodil. With her background, she wouldn't normally take part in this. It's all very strange to her. For the others there is a certain logic to it, but not for Karen. Jens Albinus plays Stoffer. To some extent He is the philosopher behind all this. If anyone has psychological problems, it's Stoffer. He's the closest we come to a psychopath, if there is such a thing. Then there's Susanne, who's the only one who's not an idiot. I see her as a childhood friend of Stoffer's. She thinks he's fantastic. At the same time she's tenderhearted. She's a nurse and has worked with people who really are retarded. She's so good that the fact that they're just playing retarded is OK. And hopefully she becomes good friends with Karen. It's of the utmost importance that we all can be convincing idiots. By definition an idiot has an IQ of 0-25 and can just stare at the wall. And that's no fun. We could call them retarded or brain damaged. There's only one way to do that. No two. Either being retarded - - or by studying real idiots. There's no reason this group should be especially good at it - - but I want you to be, because it makes my film more convincing. And together we will work out what your roles will be like. We'll be as free as in the 70s. This is absolutely It's beyond my wildest imagination. At night we'd have to bring some lights in. A phone room! What's this? Skis! Imagine four retards skiing on the road in July. Here's a real stretcher. Now you can get some sleep. Make yourself at home. Today is June 7. I'm using this dictaphone - - in a humble attempt to continue my diary. Yesterday all the actors were at the house. It went well. We attempted to define each retard's personality - - in order to vary them. On Monday we start shooting. I'm sitting here alone. And it's finally cloudy. It's nice to have a break, but at the same time I want to get started. We'll assign a number to each scene. All right? There'll be a lot of improvisations. Let's just start by giving each scene a clap. Just write scene 1, take 1. It's June 16. We had our first shooting day today. We're going to see the queen. She lives here. See the queen! I have this document. Good. That's fine. I have just looked at the dailies, and they were really sick. Funny, but I didn't notice at the time how much they were overacting. Any poetry or potential interest in spassing went out the window. Shit. It all seemed too easy anyway. - I can't get much of a shot. - I can move if I'm in the way. If you sit down there, I can put my feet here. Sit up. This is best. We talked about what went wrong and the need for downplaying. So I enjoyed filming a scene which became more serious than intended. The restaurant scene is the starting point of the film - - and was originally much funnier, and is now less so. This is the first sign that something's unusual. You're trying to feed him. - Therefore you shouldn't react. - Stoffer just thinks: "This is wrong." - "Nothing's happening." - That's because of his upbringing. And where he's coming from. That's the essence of it. You're here to have a nice lunch. And at some point, some people start having mental problems. And that spoils things. Don't act like you're turning your backs on them. Just be ourselves. - Hi. - It's OK. Hi. Hi. - Come here, Stoffer. - No. You have the same problem as Jens. When you're on camera - - you think you have to deliver. It's forbidden. There's much more light here than where Karen is sitting. When you help clean up anyway and hand him the napkin, he's pleased. You react, but slowly and incorrectly. Shall I take him outside? The object is to get her in the taxi. It's really lame - - but let's see if we can make it plausible, if that's at all possible. - You come from back here. - Let's make up our minds first. Sorry! Complete calm! No panic! - Let me get in. - Would you? Thanks. Cut! - No. That won't work. - No, it won't. - I'll hold on as tight as I can. - Don't struggle with him by the car. When he won't let go, you just give in. Let go, Stoffer. That's enough! - It's all right. I can go with you. - You're too kind. Cut. That works. Let me try. This time we'll film a more dogma-friendly version. - You've been zooming, haven't you? - You told us we mustn't zoom. - I never said that. - You said no quick movements. True. But this is a motorized zoom. Scene 11, take 6. And action! I've started doing most of the filming, and I enjoy it a lot. But partaking in these long sessions filled me with anxiety - - due to the importance of my role. It's amazing I'm willing to take it on. And still be afraid to take part in something that was my own idea. But I guess that says something about Trier's hysteria. I still can't sleep at night. That's why I'm sleepy now. But now our working hours are staggered, so I'm trying not to sleep. But that probably won't work either. I still fear cancer of the balls. That's the way it's supposed to be. I guess there's always something which prevents life from being easy. The breaks I've had in my life have been bloody short. I'd hoped that hard work, which making this film certainly is - - would help. And maybe it does. I'm not exactly panic-stricken. And I seem to get through the shoots better than I had expected. - Put it on properly. - What did I do wrong? - It's worn like this. - Sorry. For Christ's sake! I have to watch you every minute or you mess up. - I wasn't trying to mess up. - You were! It's June 24 and I've just seen the dailies from Rockwool. Claus Strandberg is brilliant as the tormented guide. Now I stopped the production of Rockwool. Everything is underplayed and just the way I like it. The retards are acting well and down to earth. I'm pleased with Stoffer. It was a great pleasure. And the absurd conditions at the factory - - contributed in making it funny, easy and uncompromising. It was just a great pleasure. Cut! Why doesn't Nana react to a stranger's presence? Karen's. - You do. - No. But he reacts to Karen. But not to Nana. Why does he ask Karen to come, but not Nana? Behave! You'd bloody well better behave. None of the others asks questions. They maintain absolute silence. - Could you define it for me? - Bloody hell! We'll do it again. - Get out, everybody. - I just want an explanation. - There is none. - OK. - One case of beer. - Okay. - A bottle of red wine. - One? Buy enough for your stay here. - So vodka, beer - Buy candy. - Susanne? - White wine or rosé. Bread and lunch meat. Do you have to bring your cigar? - Pump it up. - I'll hang it over the bar. - Why do you need two lamps? - What about the other one? I hope there aren't any spiders. It's like summer camp. Can I have a bit ...? I'm a bit cold. You can cover yourself with me. Put me over you. Would Karen sit here alone? If she were feeling thoughtful? Yes, I think so. She's been with the group all day. It could start with the line: "Why do you do it?" I'd like to do that scene without a rehearsal. The camera is running! Action. Stoffer, I'd like to ask you something. - What's that? - I was wondering - Why do you make fun of retards? - Why did you go with us? In the factory? Why do you think you did that? Why did you go in there with us? - Stop it, Stoffer. - I'm just asking her why. - It sounds like an interrogation. - Cut! - Scene 16, take 5. - Action. - Is it fun to be a retard? - It's fun for me. - More fun than when I'm not one. - Cut! Ask her again why she willingly went with you. It's been a relatively hard day. We started with the scene - - in which Stoffer explains the philosophy behind the idiot complex. We tried different approaches, all of which were hopeless. Each one portrayed Stoffer as a phony, hopeless propagandist - - faced with Karen's authentic, spotless personality. So that was no good. What I was trying to do - - was to couple it to Stoffer's project. Because I have a lot of pent-up feelings about this. So what I'm doing is evading the heart of the matter. But the impression you're conveying, which I think is wrong - - is that it's great to be a retard. That's not the point, in my opinion. This is an investigation in which we're trying to find the value of it. It's not about acting up in relation to the rest of the world. Or not having things like mansions. That's Stoffer's project. But the basic idea is that there's value in these borderline areas. That's why she's stayed. Because it's fascinating. There's something about it we find alluring. But apart from that, why has she stayed here? - Do I say that? - No. I'm just trying to work it out. - You just found it interesting. - Yes. - And it is, isn't it? - Yes. The problem now is to make sure that Stoffer is convincing in this scene. Why does Stoffer defend the moral aspect of it? If Karen wins, and we don't believe their justification, she would leave. Why is it of secondary importance that retarded people are a problem? They're only a problem because of our morals. We'll have no retarded cashiers because we demand efficiency. Our morals prohibit them in having a sex life and say they're ugly. Aesthetics and morality are being questioned. You can give all the reasons you like and good ones at that - - but you can't compare reason and feelings. Karen represents feelings. When feelings and theory meet, theory always loses. It's just like defining love. Defining it is like beating it into the ground. In our discussion the actors revealed their commitment to the idiot cause. Why idiocy and the whole project was important. I found it moving. I understand Stoffer. If she's just sitting there - - I'd like to say: "Go home, Karen. You're right. We are poking fun." Maybe he should say that. Yes! Because the film's point of view is the girl who comes into the group. We see it through her eyes. When she asks the question: "Why are you doing this?" If she doesn't just accept it - - Karen would feel rejected and so would the audience. We decided to turn the situation around - - so Stoffer didn't try to manipulate Karen, at least not directly. What, Josephine? It's better if she stays because she wants in on this life - - rather than because she's convinced by some theory. The film becomes our argument. - Why do they do that? - Damn good question. I feel sorry for people who don't have our intellect. So So how... So how can you justify acting the idiot? You can't. The bit about having found their inner idiot is a bit difficult. - It sounds like. It smacks of - Of everything we don't like. The bit about being a person of the future works. And sitting in a wheelchair like Ped. Who wouldn't like to do that? So we moved our failed discussion from inside to outside - - where the ceiling was a mile high. This was inspirational. All the retards wandering about reminded me of - - Truffaut's "Fahrenheit"-something - - where people are in the woods memorizing books. It was very beautiful, insanely naive and sentimental all at once. These are gifts, inspirations that one wouldn't have included in a script. So the essence of the dogma rules is that they give one lots of freedom. And you'd better pull yourself together or I'll be furious. - You don't do a thing. - Not even when she takes the mayo? - No, let's see what happens. - Hey! I want to be on TV too! The less you try, the more you'll succeed. Quiet! One more take. You thank them too profusely. When you rub it on, treat it like suntan lotion. Pick it up and hold it for a second, so I can film it. - I bet you hear that all the time. - I quit! - Are you trying to get attention? - Feel how cold my fingers are. Oh, your fingers. I was told to tell you to play slower. This film is much less calculating than "Breaking the Waves"- - and yet much more calculating. That may be hard to understand. It's allowing oneself to go on a picnic of effects - - with many references to Widerberg and Tarkovski and fuck all. While I was filming, I actually cried. And since this is a diary - - some honesty is required. I got all choked up. And suddenly afraid for my talent. I know this sounds terrible, but after a scene like that - - I'm afraid hubris will strike like a fist from the sky - - and annihilate me, Just like a mosquito in the woods. And then I think, "Cancer! I'll get cancer now. " But that's how I feel at the end of a day like today. A day in Trier's puppet theater. - Good morning, everybody. - Good morning. The only item on today's agenda is getting started at the same time. For three days I've stressed the importance of being on time - - and today three people were, and the rest were late. It's impossible for you all to be so late. It makes me furious. At 9:00 I'm all fired up for our next scene and now it's 9:37. Fuck it! Lene, how can we solve this? We pick them at a designated time. No, they have to wait as long as they've kept us waiting. - I was here early. - Yes, you can go in. - I have to wait half an hour. - I'll wait ten minutes. Wait inside. We'll call you when we need you. You can clean up the kitchen. It's a mess. The actors and I discussed their dissatisfaction with my sarcasm. They accused me of being too hard on them. But I don't blame myself too much - - because at the same time I'm also very nice to them. - I'll do that then. - You did just fine. I'm pleased. - The others are the bad ones. - You're right. This is the least of my problems. - Hello. - Hello. Is the house for sale? I didn't see a sign out front. Why is the van here? Do you work with ...? - It's for the mentally handicapped. - What? Retards are treated differently today. Completely different from the policy in the old days. The policy restricted the number of institutions in residential areas. Say "limit" the number. They don't have any at all. Not one. - Where's zayn ? - The Seine is in Paris. Nice meeting you. We'll see you soon. We'll see you before you can count to ten. - I feel pressured. - You don't exactly agree to it Don't say the lines or I won't be able to use them. I just think it's fun to join in the improvisation. - All set? - Take it easy. Sorry! Nobody gives me any respect. No! Stop it. Sulker Sulker - Zayn . - What is zayn ? - In Paris? - Frieze? - Freeze? - Frieze! They look dangerous. What do you think, Jesper? - One of them had a puppy. - That's the dangerous part. The worst criminals always have a puppy, and then suddenly Your characters are the only people who treat the retards decently. And that's the funny part. You dangerous types are decent guys. - That's what we liked about it. - And also what's funny. The irony is that you are portrayed as nice guys. - They've all been bouncers. - Doormen are despicable. Well, some of them are. In the beginning you are strong, silent types and seem rather dangerous. So we're afraid for him. He's a reject, and so are you in a way - - and therefore you feel a bond. So what they're saying over there There are five dots on one side, and three on the other. Ready? How about that? What's the matter? Do you have to pee? You have to pee, don't you? Right there. Hand me the camera, will you? - It's pretty small. - Is there room for you beside him? - So this is what we'll do. It's not - Big. Quit harping about it. - It looks bigger on camera. - Lift his shirt up. - Exactly. - I mustn't block the light. I stand right behind him and help him from here. And take your time. He has to piss, but can't lower his trousers. You have to give him a hand. He can't hold it. - No, he bloody well can't. - Not a retard like him. You could argue about it! - There you go. - Drain the spuds then. - Come on. - It might help to turn on the water. It's interesting that tough guys like you are interested in hygiene. Yes, dry your hands. You can't grope Linda with piss on your hands. - Is there a close-up of his dick? - You bet. We want to see everything. You go down to the men's room, and we'll go to the ladies'. Let go, Stoffer. A consultant from a mental home said we should show their sexuality. One could say portraying retards without that factor - - is rather like Evangelical literature about sexuality. That is, we need to show the whole spectrum or forget it. I told him about our problem of getting Jens Albinus a hard-on - - in the ladies' changing room, in spite of Susanne's valiant efforts. lsuggested an injection which would give him a 2-hour erection. A bit claustrophic, in my opinion. But I must applaud Jens' success in getting a hard-on. We used all kinds of methods to help, plus Susanne. She's very touching. That is, Anne Louise. She's very compassionate, which must be a burden for her. And she claims to have personal problems and anxieties - - which are bloody well-hidden, I must say. At the very least, one could say she is vivacious. Are we having a party? Because it's my birthday? - It's not really my birthday. - And we're not real retards. We filmed the party scene, for which they made tickets. How ridiculous can you get! Then we experimented with ways of leading up to the gang-bang. And that was bloody difficult. - Picture lottery? Spin the bottle? - Gang-bang! Gang-bang! How does one get from Stoffer's suggestion to the actual act? Stoffer says it as a provocation, since he's that kind of person. Then Nana says: "That's the first healthy idea you've ever had." And she means it. Because a gang-bang basically is about social contact - - and contact between people. Cut! - Like that? - Yes, I have a few adjustments. It shouldn't be so imbecile. It's OK if you laugh at the start. But if every time we show something sexually dangerous - - we hear giggling, then the dangerous aspect is gone. It's interesting to me that there are so many improvisations. Everything we've filmed today is far from the original script and idea. Basically these are things the actors could have done. They lead up to something and don't follow it up for some reason. It's interesting to observe and to ask for. This is possible because I have the camera and an hour's tape - - and the scenes are really long, so things can just develop - - and I can incorporate them. This is possible because we're videotaping and have plenty of time. I'll bloody well give you a gang-bang. Instead of filming, can't you give us a hand? Today I'd say that "The idiots" is the most interesting film I've made. And although it fulfills needs arising from frustrations in my childhood - - it's certainly interesting that the first words that come to mind - - if I were to describe the goal of the project - - would be a search for authenticity. Later we had a "half-way party", which was nice. And I even danced for the first time in years. I did my Travolta routines, which I learned at dance school. It was really fun and lfelt like a young man again - - together with the girls. It was liberating. Life still has many facets. A retard picture? - Shouldn't we take a retard picture? - Yes! In brief flashes, life is wonderful. PS. The last sentence and this entry has made me so nervous - - that I'm getting physical symptoms. Plus it's a very hot day. Declaring: "Life is wonderful" fills me with anxiety beyond imagination. No matter what conclusions I draw or what anxiety this may bring - - I am very satisfied with my private and my professional life. Good morning. ls the camera running? I've been pondering about my relationship to actresses. As I said to Bente, in the beginning of my career - - I had a very difficult relationship to them. I was almost at war with them. That changed during "The Kingdom" - - and even more during "Breaking the Waves". I know I have fallen, not into the same trap - - but the same automatic relationship as other directors. And my conclusion is that it's much more healthy than the hostile one. Perhaps they're two sides of the same coin. This can be troublesome for the actress and for one's partner - - but any feeling at all is good, as I keep saying to myself. What I'm trying to say is that maybe one should just accept this as a fact. - ls something crawling on my back? - That's a cheap come-on. You're already getting What do they call it? Delirious. Yes. That snake you put over there Oh, you mean the one that just slithered by? We call that the garden hose. - So everybody is here now. - Yes. - All set? - Yes. It's big. This is almost how endangered species are treated. For example, putting them in a zoo. It's bordering on the perverse. - Do they know they'll be on camera? - I have no idea. - But you're their contact, Kristoffer. - I'll go talk to them. Could you come over here? Of course you have to be nice. Reverential is the right word, I think. - Camera ready. - It's talking. That thing down there. Yes, it is. Scene 53, take 2. Hi! Could we have one of them hug Josephine? Either Lis Bente or Torben. They would be your best bets. Shall I take a look at you? My old buddy. - Look at him. - OK. We had a visit from the mongols, who are really sweet. The only problem was that during the first shooting - - none of the actors was in character. Well maybe Josephine, but the rest of them weren't. It's uncomfortable, but don't show it. I don't think you should say anything. Your face gives you away. You just have to be humiliated like the rest. - There were some good moments. - It's rather disgusting, isn't it? But there's a goal higher than ourselves. Zentropa's income. The actors forgot their characters' names, so they used their own. That's the clash between reality and fiction. - Can I take a picture of you all? - Yes! Look over here. Everyone looks great except you, Henrik. Smile! It's wrong of them not to talk to me. They've shut me out from day one. That's the way I feel. I talk to them, but they don't answer. It's the other way round. You say the most provoking things to them. "When you saw the real retards, you realized how bloody awful you are." "it's a crock of shit." You can't expect an answer to that. The rest of you were great. Who knocked something over? - Jeppe. - That was just fine. It will be one of our best outtakes. OK Is it fair to say that we're not up to form after a visit from the real retards? They really took the piss! Oh hell, Karen. Susanne, Karen's gone into spass. Hi. I couldn't find you. We're so happy here. I have no right to be happy. Yes, you do, Karen. Of course you do. We still had to shoot the decisive scene on the steps - - in which Karen shows her great sorrow without revealing its cause. I thought Karen could use Susanne like a mirror or see herself in her - - because in the film no one shows any consideration for Susanne. So I thought they could find a mutual connection or solidarity. I had cynically counted on that happening. It didn't. The great release I had hoped for never came. I couldn't sense any bond between them - - or any acceptance from Susanne of Karen's grief or her very presence. I don't know much about how actors work, but when they have to cry - - some dig up a personal sorrow they normally keep to themselves - - and can thus cry more or less at the drop of a hat. You say everyone is happy here. More happy than you're allowed. You should feel really bad, as bad as the child that died. That's the basis of it all. And we're all going to die, right? The next day Bodil and Anne Louise were to go on with the scene - - which now takes place at the window. This is the third or fourth day we've tried to capture it. Then the most fantastic thing happened. After Bodil's many attempts to reach that level of emotion - - she suddenly burst out crying - - because she happened to think about an old hymn. "See the sun rising You know that hymn, don't you? I guess my direction was completely off the mark. I try every angle but you just pretend to listen - - and then at the sight of a leaf quivering, you break down. However, my biggest objection was that Susanne wasn't credible. It's paradoxical that she wasn't equal to it - - or that it didn't live up to my concept of authenticity. Lars, am I supposed to say that? Do I have to combine the two? - Goodness, you're nervous! - I know. Do I just comfort her? - Or do I say something particular? - Say what we've talked about. Because then she'll probably say that she shouldn't cry. Anne Louise was very anxious about this scene - - because my expectations have reached hysterical heights. But she is great at dialogue and is a bloody good actress. She is one of the most promising actresses I've seen in years. But if she gets nervous and doesn't dare, it's reflected in her acting. It's a perfectly natural mental block. Is it gone now? The problem with telling the story is that you're referring to your own. I went into a sort of therapy mode - - because all our talks somehow bordered on the therapeutic. So I encouraged her to talk about it and to open up. And she did. I have always felt it was easier to be nice to people. I have always found it easy. And I have always had to be strong. But that's the loneliest thing in the world. That's what it is. Lonely. But it's like I've never really met anyone, with whom I could just open up. I really need to talk to somebody, because Because I don't allow myself to feel. It's hard to make room for feelings. And after she had said the word "room", she got a tic. So this is how therapists work, they observe and add things up. Unspoken things are revealed. Things from the subconscious. Why don't you have room for them? I just don't. I've always been told there isn't. I've always been told that there was no room for feelings. I just need to let go of it all. Maybe we should take a break and do a scene. - Take 66, 2. - Why does it say 60? 60, 2. Sorry. The fact that we had done this exercise in psychodrama - - made her lines sound natural and unforced. I got exactly what I wanted out of Susanne. You're allowed to be happy. You're allowed to be here and be happy. - Do you believe me? - Yes. It makes one feel good to help someone feel release - - although it doesn't have anything to do with the film. I must admit I feel some satisfaction, although without any cynicism. I wouldn't say I've been fooling with something out of my depth - - because I do know something about it. I tell myself that it can only be beneficial. Go! That hurt like hell. - Go get it. - No fucking way. - Do it again. - That's because I'm not dead yet. - Did you go shopping? - Yes. But we couldn't find herbs. - Shopping for 2 hours and 40 min.? - It was crazy. Hi. We're spending the night here. I don't know what the plan is. We'll see. Maybe we could use a scene or two from it in the final film. Since we were meant to stay here the whole time - - maybe we'll get a taste of what I had hoped for - - that is, that the actors had stayed here and cooked their meals here. In the case of this film, that was a complete failure. Where's the trash can? They have no feeling for the props, which I find surprising. I thought actors felt props were holy - - and felt responsible for props which define their character. But no one feels responsible for the house. No one cleans up. All the worst aspects of living in a commune have surfaced here. No one felt like spassing or acting in character. Bodil spassed a bit. Then we had dinner, and that was uneventful. - Where are our dinner plates? - Inside. - Your wine or mine? - This is mine. Is that the last of it? - They poured the rest in a melon. - Have some of this boring salad. Put some more of that gooey red stuff on it. We were to talk about spassing and what it stood for. In a previous conversation, they voiced their unconditional support - - and how fantastic it was. Now they were inattentive and almost hostile. How do you want to do it? Should we sit around the fireplace? Can't we send a team in to light the fire? - Some of us went shopping. - And some didn't do squat. There's an unhappy baby who's been crying for a long time. Can't you hear it? There it was again. Then I felt a strange loneliness - - and you may well laugh - - but it's rooted in my childhood and parties I attended - - but didn't participate in, but rather sat sulking in a corner. - What is zayn ? - Sane or insane? - What's zayn ? - What is ZA YN ? What is zayn ? What is zayn ? - What's happened? - I put cream on. It doesn't itch yet. - What's zayn ? What can I say? - Can you figure that one out? - Are you going to sit there? - Shut up and let me participate. All you want to do is to get rid of me as fast as possible. Don't touch me! - I didn't touch you. - What's wrong, Lars? Be quiet. Be quiet. Stop it. Get the retards straight so we can do this film. The cake isn't included. Camera ready. Shut the fuck up! Quit telling me to lighten up every time I open my mouth. - You shut up. - No! This is my house. Stoffer, have a beer and a Valium! Come on, Stoffer. I felt more and more left out and my jealousy in regard to to everything. The girls. I just felt lonely in the group. It was so oppressive that I had to go to bed - - while Kristoffer bravely chaired another session. From what could hear, it was completely useless - - because of power struggles between the actors. Be quiet while I tell you about the game. It's called T, P or K. T is truth. And P is percent. And K is kiss. How high How high is the percentage of your faith in spassing? My faith in it? Zero. I would like to thank you for the past 24 hours. There's no way I can get out of this with honor. It's impossible. But we've learned something, so now our lives can be a calculated hell. - Right. Thanks very much. - Thank you. No one can blame me for not admitting my mistakes. So get the hell out of here! Smllermd fascists! Smllermd fascists! Crazy bastard! Today's PS must be that it's all about being loved. And about having power. Emotional and physical power. - What a racket you're making here. - What are you doing here? - Camera running. - 66, 4. The newspaper arrived. It's 3 am. I'm tossing and turning. 66, 5. It's churning around in my head, and after the weekend - - I had gotten over the mess with Anne Louise - - but now I can't get the damn thing out of my head. I can't take it any more. I just want to finish the film - - so I don't have to see her. Nothing seems to settle me down. I'm lying here alone because Bente is in Tisvilde. She should be with me. Bloody hell! Who does she think she is? Something which gives one great joy, can be painful at the same time. - This must be our slowest day ever. - Yes, I've had a hell of a crisis too. We have to finish this. Two more hours to get this bloody scene. It's the next scene in the sequence. Should we bite the bullet and get it over with? OK. Listen Some of you have lines in the scene, so leave some "space" for them. - What lines? - You two don't have any. - But Ped does. - Like: "Should we take him upstairs?" For fuck's sake! Just do it properly. I'm totally fed up with it now. Do you think I've gone mad? Christ, you're all pathetic. Are you afraid now? How could I dream of getting an honest answer - - from young career-hungry actors? And who the hell can see me as I really am? I just have to survive the next few weeks. To hell with it! Come home, Bente. In a huge cry for contact and love, I gush with pubescent honesty - - which makes everything worse. We haven't accomplished a sense of closeness or understanding. The only one who really believes in this film - - or thought there was some reality in it, was me. But that's all right. Fine! Fine! I guess I have to learn it the hard way every time. But that's the technique. To believe in it. Since I'm the director, I have to believe in the film. Or my starting point must be that I'm doing the right thing. And that's why it's so bloody hard and I become a little child - - when I realize this isn't reality, but acting. It's like a little game that little Lars has thought up - - and it never becomes reality because the heart of matter is - - that we are 190% alone in our own tiny, ridiculous, humiliating world. I'm sick to death of this. I don't believe in you at all. Go home and do your spassing at home or at work. Then I'll believe in you and not before. Who's first? The morning of July 21. Our final week. I'm prepared. I've slept fairly well even though I realized last night - - that the lump in my throat must be cancer of the esophagus. And now I'm going to give those bloody girls the cold shoulder. I'm sick and tired of all' that touchy-fee!y stuff. You must know when you came down. Must I do everything for you? - I don't know how far you'd gotten. - Find out for fuck's sake. If the bottle points at you, you have to go to a place - - where the people really mean something to you. Shut the fuck up! Are you done now? Is there anything else? Do you have a pain in the ass? Then butt out! Jens was impatient and is the first to sense - - the tiniest imbalance in the group. And he can read me in 4 1/2 seconds. When do I do it? And that will be all for today. - What happened? Nothing! - I tried. You cleared your throat three times. - Let's go home, Henrik. - I'm not coming. Stoffer is right. - It was fine. You tried. - Don't say it was fine. It wasn't. - Yes, but - No buts. All you say is: "You tried." - What are we trying to do now? - You don't have to change anything. I'm just trying to get them to Just relax. Don't panic! Can we try it now? I think I understand. What day is it? We've seen Troels teach - - and then we go home to bed and it's the next morning? - So Nana goes first. - And then I say goodbye. - No, you must wait. - There's something I want to say. 78,11. - What day is it tomorrow? - Saturday. Then I can do it. It's my turn to go home and play the idiot. At home. But someone must come with me. Do it again with a little smile. It was a good day. Bodil was brilliant and played a great scene. - But Susanne has lost her footing. - Let's do it. Now, OK? She needed help from her director and she didn't get squat. - Look at me. - Right. Tomorrow it's my turn to go home and play the idiot. But I need someone with me. And you can't all come with me. - It may not be pleasant. - Don't laugh with the others. - What day is it tomorrow? - Saturday. Then I can do it. I decided I would require a certain standard of professionalism. We yelled at each other like crazy, or rather I didn't yell - - but was terribly provoking, of course. And the end result was - - that the role of Susanne was completely ruined. Not a good result, to put it mildly. Let's do it! Why the hell does it have to take so long? You can take your things home. You can take your things home. You can take yourselves home. - Go home! - Just keep the standard tomorrow. A little tear from Susanne won't do. I want her to cry her heart out. Let's rehearse it and stick to a strict plot. Unlike the rest of the film. And as regards the two emotional moments - - just skip them during rehearsal. We'll see how we get there later. We have the whole day tomorrow. Suddenly we jump a hundred years back in time. Rather cliched. - Hello, mother. - Hello, Karen. But the scene soon found its natural form. Or unnatural, if you will. Where have you been? We thought you were dead. You want to go, but it's dangerous. What could happen to her? You see her mother. She doesn't look so nice. Now what? Then you see her sister. What's she doing? - What can I say? - I understand what you mean. - Karen, is that you? - Yes, grandfather. Anders and Karen lost their son. It's probably harder for Anders. She just disappeared and didn't come to the funeral. That's all that's left of the child. Hello, grandfather. Hello, Anders. He hits you, but that doesn't stop you from spassing. Only Susanne can do that. When we saw spassing at the table, our barriers were truly transcended. It illustrated how strictly we lay down the laws of table manners. I can't seem to get anywhere right now. I can't seem to get the tears flowing like I can at other times. - And as you'd like me to. - Yes, because you're our audience. If we don't get your reaction, then all our tears are in vain. This is the kind of film they teach you not to make at film school. Because the point isn't revealed until the end. And when it finally is, we need a violent reaction. It's like riding off into the sunset. We need the same closure. Otherwise there's no release. The slap was perfect and we got the beginning down pat - - but of course I wasn't pleased with Anne Louise, and she knew it. We were ready the next day, and the next day she was sick, of course. It was very dramatic. She ended up in the hospital - - and was kept under observation for appendicitis. Then the bitch was discharged and to make a long story short - - we spent our last shooting day, Sunday, in Karen's home. I'm closing the door. She clearly had a mental block, and since the scene presumes to be - - the liberation of Karen, assisted and encouraged by Susanne - - we had to give it our all, so the film would reach its peak. - I'd like a bit of ugliness. - Ugliness? Was there ugliness in the window scene? I found it extremely beautiful. But I like ugliness. Maybe she needs a slap too, so she'll feel something. - Now? From him? - Or from me. - I'm trying to be Susanne. - Fuck Susanne. I need three seconds where you find the feeling within yourself - - and then you look at her and unite the two experiences in your mind. This is what the whole film is about. It really is. She lacked the admiring director she'd had during most of the film. And that's made Susanne's personality strong. I was a much better director in admiration than in disgust. Much, much better. You poor little thing. You're struggling for your life. - I don't know what to do. - You don't have to do anything. I won't torture you any more, although it isn't torture. You should enjoy my attention. In 4 1/2 hours it's gone for good. Yes. But all of a sudden she could do it and gave a great performance. And Bodil, who was taken by surprise at Anne Louise's acting - - followed suit and gave a fantastic performance. It was very moving. And much to the film's credit, it all ended very satisfactorily. That's enough, Karen. Shall we go? She has to get up of her own accord. Don't drag her away. It's up to her whether she wants to go or not. It's essential. It's a real Nora situation. Leave with dignity. Yes. In regard to the two crying women, lfelt like a Chinese circus artist - - spinning plates on bamboo sticks. The plates spun on their own - - but occasionally needed a push. I think we've made a good film, and I think it was all worthwhile. On the other hand, the films I truly believed in bombed. We'll see. Subtitles: Karen Margrete Wiin SubLine
