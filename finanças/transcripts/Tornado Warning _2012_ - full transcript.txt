Goodbye Ms. Suzy. Dad! Dad! It's okay, girl. Yeah, it's gonna be alright soon. All mothers go through it, yeah. About 30 days from now, we'll get them foal out of you. Everything'll be okay, how's that sound? Yeah, good girl. I gotta say you look good. This'll all be over soon, yeah. The horse whisperer. Hey. How long you been standing there? Long enough to see the old man hasn't lost his touch. Old man. Well you aren't getting any younger. Hey, you'd better watch it, young lady. I'll have you bailing hay to earn your keep. Got my SATs back. Oh yeah? Look. I'm in the 99th percentile. I aced it. It's enough to get me into the University of Chicago. Congratulations, honey. I'm proud of you. What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing? No. You're jealous. I'm not jealous. I'm the first person in this family to go to college and you're jealous. Honey, I'm not jealous. Why can't you just be happy for me? I'm happy for you. You're walking away. I'm not walking away. When mom was sick and you didn't wanna tell me how bad it was, you just walked away. It's fine. Honey. Kelly! What? Get in the storm cellar! What? Get in the storm shelter now! Dad! Kelly! Dad! What? This is Brad. Hey Brad, it's Gail Curtis. Gail Curtis, how did you get my cellphone number? You're not the only person I know at the National Weather Service. It's too early in the morning, Gail. Listen, I'm getting reports of tornado activity in six counties and there's nothing on your website about it and diddly squat on any of the news nets. You care to comment? Hello, Brad? When was this? Yesterday evening through this morning. There hasn't been any tornado activity in Illinois in the last 48 hours. So 132 people are lying? No, I'm saying that you have enthusiastic readers. And that's the official government line? Nothing happened? You have a good day, Ms. Curtis. Brad. What the hell was that all about? Hello. Where the hell did you come from? Oh my god! What? This place is terrible. All this damage. Brother, I cannot believe it. Tell me it's not as bad as it looks. It's worse. Hi Kelly. Hey Norm. Well you're not the only one. Everybody in this county's seeing tornadoes. Look, I don't know how you people deal with this from year to year. I came here from the big city for a life of ease and I feel like I walked into a bullseye. If you go back, take me with you. Chicago? Girl, I thought you liked this country life. Yeah, sure, Norm. When I said I couldn't wait to try Union Street, I was just kidding. Kelly, don't talk like that. I'm sorry, I'm a little stressed right now. All our livestock are dead. All of them? All but one pregnant mare. Sorry about that, buddy. It's not the end of the world, right? Our insurance will cover it, right dad? Dad? Is there something I should know? Honey, you remember the twister back in '08? Yeah. The insurance company said our buildings weren't up to code so our claim was denied. Wait, what? I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry. How did we get the money? I had to use mom's life insurance. That was my college fund. Honey, I'm sorry. I thought I could make it up. Kelly. What? Where are you going? I'm going to Vickie's. Why? To help her decide what courses to take and university. Man, I don't know what to say. Just tell me you got the booze. In the trunk. Judd, you gotta let it go. You gotta stop living in the past, man. I mean you just gotta let it go. You tell me what's so good about the present. My farm's a wreck, I'm dead broke. My daughter hates me. Sound like a bad country western song. Look, Kelly's a good girl. She gonna get over it. Nah, you don't know her. She's been dreaming about leaving Lando all her life. Well I guess I got a little bit to do with that. I'd appreciate it if you stop filling her head with all those big city dreams. You got to tell people about the best hot dog place in Chicago. The Filling Station on Union Avenue. Gus has been in a business for what, 50 years? What does this have to do with hot dogs? Look man. The things happen. It's just bad luck. I mean, you act like this damn thing is chasing after you personally. Oh, you didn't see it. See what? Tornado. Been there, done that. No, this wasn't your run of the mill, garden variety twister. I've seen a lot of things, Norm, but this was not right. This was different. Different? Yeah, it was just hanging over that government compound down there, just hovering, and all these weird lights in the clouds and it was shooting out these lightning bolts. Man, this beer thing was a bad idea. This got nothing to do with drinking! I'm not nuts, I know what I saw! Why you yelling at me? I'm trying to help you. How the hell you gonna help me? You're gonna help me. You couldn't even hack it as a big city cop and you're sitting there telling me you're gonna help me. Judd, you don't know what you're talking about. No, I don't know what I'm talking about 'cause you never told me why you left the city. Need to shut up. Why did you come to Lando? And don't give me that garbage that you came down here for that laid back country living. I think it's time for me to go. Maybe that's a good idea. The beer's on me. Big deal. Look, give me a call when you sleep it off. Well don't hold your breath. Have a good one, buddy. Oh my god. Gail Curtis in the flesh! It's so good to finally meet you! Denise Gordon. You're Climate Chick. That's right, honey. Your number one fan. Look at you. So much prettier in person. What is it? You're just not what I expected. A little older. A little wiser I hope. Yeah, that's it. Come on, let's get you checked in. Frank, he's the manager. He'll wanna put you in the big spender suite. It's the one they reserve for the VIPs but I recommend the honeymoon grotto. Harry, that's my husband, took me there for our 10th wedding anniversary. Rest his soul. Did you feel that? What? Sudden drop in the barometric pressure. Tornado. How did you know? 10 years of storm chasing. It's sixth sense. That's it, that's what I saw. I've never seen anything like it. That makes two of us. Chasing it. Let's do it. No, Denise. This could be dangerous. Well I can't let you go alone. You don't know the area. Okay, come on. Hey Ben, lock up my scooter. Let's go. I'm doing it. Hello? It's me. Kelly. My bike blew a tire. Can you come without lecturing me? Where are you? I'm just down the road from Vickie's. Don't move. I'll be there in 15 minutes. I don't think we're gonna catch it. Here, see if you can get more video. I can't believe a celebrity like you doesn't already have an assistant. Harry always told me I was wasting time with websites like yours. If he'd listened, maybe he'd still be here. Hang on, I'm pulling over. Well alright. What's going on? Stay put. Okay. Unbelievable! Oh crap! Have you been drinking? What kind of question is that? Dad, I'm 17. I do know what alcohol smells like. Honey, I don't know what you want me to say. I've already said I'm sorry. Yeah, sure. Do we have to listen to that? Why not? Well for starters it's a little loud. So old. What? I said you are so old. I don't wanna fight with you. Who's fighting? Do you mind? Do you mind? In case you've forgotten, I'm still your father. I'd appreciate it if you'd stop treating me like I was the enemy. Well news flash, dad, I just found out my entire life is over. So dramatic. Your life isn't over, it's just beginning. Well dad, what do you expect me to do? Spend the rest of my life on a farm? What's wrong with that? What's wrong with that? Yeah, what's wrong with that? Dad, I wanna be a scientist. Not a damn shepherd. What? What is that? Beats me. What the? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh my god. You jerk! Where's he going like a bat out of hell? Oh my god. Oh my god, dad. Dad. What are you doing? Going after 'em. I gotta warn 'em. Are you serious? They'll get themselves killed. They're from the city obviously. Hey! That's a tornado up ahead! Turn around! Hey! Hold on, honey, hold on. The hell's wrong with you? You alright? My god, yes. Honey, get under that bridge. What? Get under that bridge and stay there til I come back. I'll be back, please. Dad. Great. Aren't we a little close? wants us to provoke a response! We can't get out of the. I don't like being the bait! I love being the bait! Tell me we have something. Another one bites the dust. This is not good, Mr. Parnell. Please. Take care of it. Time to get out of dodge. Who are these guys? Power company maybe? Not dressed like that. I smell FBI. Can I help you ladies? No, we're just tourists. I'm gonna have to ask you to do that somewhere else. You don't look like a rent-a-cop. I'm a federal agent. Oh. So you're trying to hide something, huh? What is it? Some new kind of twister caused by, what, runaway global warming? I don't know what you're talking about. Now are you going to put that away or am I gonna have to confiscate it? Are you serious? Yes. Um yeah. Ow, I am aware of the Patriot Act. That doesn't give you the right to take away my own personal property. Is there a problem here? Oh, Sheriff Mackey. Thank goodness. This fascist goon just stole my friend's phone. Is that what happened, ma'am? Yeah. I'm a federal agent and this is a national security investigation. National security? Since when... Can I help you folks? Are you the person in charge? That's right, Agent Armstrong. I'm with the federal task force in charge of infrastructure security. These are my credentials. Integrated threat response unit? Never heard of that. I thought tornadoes were FEMA territory. They are until they destroy a public utility. Then that's when they call us. Sheriff, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding but we've had massive structural damage and I'd appreciate it if you'd please keep your people back at least 100 meters from the site. For their safety, of course. Sounds reasonable. Gentlemen, let's get back to work. You are not gonna let him do this. Come on, come on. That guy was lying through his teeth. Look, he made a good case but now I wanna know what you were doing here in the first place. Gail is a tornado expert from the city. I told her what was going on down here and she came to see for herself. Really? Yes. You've had a lot of very strange weather happening lately, sheriff, and I don't know if you noticed but it hasn't been making the news. I have noticed. Well I think that these guys are probably responsible for that. Come on, let's go, everybody. Back to your cars. Let's go. Let's get out of here. Everybody's got a job to do. No, these goons compromised our civil rights. I mean it was ridiculous. They were... Ms. Curtis, this is not Chicago. Things are different around here, understand? I'm just trying to figure out what's going on with these storms, the storms that nobody seems to be talking about. Well that makes two of us. Hey Norm, we gotta talk. Something really weird is going on around here. You're telling me. Gail Curtis, Judd Walker. This is the farmer I was telling you about. Ms. Curtis is a meteorologist from my old neighborhood. Actually, former storm chaser turned climate blogger. Climate blogger? Yeah, I write for a website. I know what a blog is. Me and Kelly got run off the road by a black SUV. Looked like it had government people in it, something like that. They were chasing another one of those twisters. I know. I had a run in with 'em myself. And I forgot to tell you about my cows. Your cows? Yeah, cows, they always face north south. They got a compass in their brain and before that storm, they were all walking around in circles like their compasses were going all haywire. I'm telling you, Norm, something very strange is going on. Wait, there's no scientific evidence that undulates are sensitive to electromagnetism. Undu-what? Cattle. Oh. No offense, lady, but all those fancy words, they don't mean anything to me. I have farmer's intuition. Oh, of course, right. Who needs science? Cutting open pigs and checking their entrails was just fine for our ancestors, right? Look, look, why don't the two of y'all just take it down a notch, okay? I wanna know what's going on around here as much as you do but Judd, why don't you take Ms. Curtis back over to the farm, show her around, and the two of you guys come up with some answers? I don't think so, I'm no babysitter. Excuse me, what's that supposed to mean? Look, I would do it myself but man, you can see I am swamped with paper work. Okay. My truck's outside. It's not a limousine so you have to rough it. Oh, that's okay, cowboy, but I know how to drive. My daddy let me get my license when I was 16. He's very progressive that way. Sorry Judd, but a little respect might be nice. You owe me. Big time. * Don't let me go * Let me flee * Don't let me know, let me know, let me know * * That you hate me Dad! Yeah. You've gotta hear this. Oh my god! What? Gail Curtis? You know her? I had to do a report on tornadoes for science class. Her blog is like the hangout for storm chasers. Hi, I'm Kelly. I heard your farm got hit and I think whatever did it is something new. Something that we've never seen before. He told you about our livestock didn't he? Well, I have something better. Come on. Come on. Wow. What do you think? I think I wanna hear it again. Well I checked out your site and there was a twister that was reported about three miles from here at the exact same time I recorded this. Maybe it means something. Maybe it does. Can you make me a copy? Way ahead of you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you gonna do with this? Have it analyzed. By who? I have a friend in the city. He's a freelance code monkey. He's big into cryptography. No offense but we don't know you from Adam. Yes we do. No we don't. If we're gonna give this to anybody, we're gonna give it to Norm Mackey. He'll hand it over to the proper authorities. Oh, you mean like those thugs that nearly ran you off the road. Listen to her, Judd. She knows her stuff. Denise, if I want your opinion, I'll ask for it. You're just so... Okay Denise, I think we'd better leave. Good idea. I hope you're happy. Interfering with science. Listen, when you change your mind, here's my information. I'm at the Stay N' Save. Did you hear what he said to me? The rudeness. His wife would've slapped him upside the head. He's married? Was. She's dead now. I suppose I shouldn't blame him. Lord knows losing Harry did a number on me. It's more of those men from the power station. Now where are they off to in such a hurry? Are we following them? Looks like it. Another car chase. This is getting exciting. I'm sorry, honey. I just don't think it's a good idea for us to trust everybody, especially some celeb-utant from the city. For all we know, she might be working with the feds from last night. That's your problem, dad. You don't trust anybody or anything. That's not true. I trust my instincts. Trust the ground under my feet. I trust hard work. I trust you. Really? You didn't trust me enough to tell me that we're broke. Honey, don't be like that. Just walk away. Come on, car. When are they gonna make a hybrid with some power? I hear that. They're turning up ahead. Oh my lord! What's the matter? Some kind of interference. Like a really strong magnet? Not just cattle. It's coming this way. I see it. Go! Denise! Denise, no! Hey. What is it? Who is it? Judd Walker. What do you want, cowboy? I was a little rough on you earlier. I wanna apologize. Think your friend still wants to see this? I'm on it. Heading there now. Dead? Yeah. I've known Denise most of my life. I barely knew her at all and I'm a wreck. You okay? Yeah. She predicted this. Really? Yeah. Her husband, Harry, he was killed by a tornado about three years ago and, well I'm not quite sure what happened. She got a warning on a website and got into the cellar on time and he didn't and all these years she's been telling everybody that one day they were gonna be reunited by a twister. I saw something on the farm that kinda scared me. What would scare a guy like you? Well. I took pictures, it's on the flash drive. Here? Oh my god, that's horrible. What are all those pins? Confirmed tornado sightings from the last 48 hours. You think there's a pattern? If there is, I haven't found it yet. Gail Curtis? Hey Barney, listen. I just sent you an audio file. Could you help me out and analyze it for me? Do it as fast as you can. Well I'm glad to see you too. Alright, I got it. Now exactly what am I supposed to be looking for? Anything and everything. I think it's some sort of signal or code. So we're on to something big. Alright. I'll throw the phone book at it. Give me a couple of hours. I'll see what I can come up with. Thanks Barney, you're the best. Looks like all these are near government land or public utilities. This one here that wiped out my farm, it's right down from a NORAD tracking station and this one, there's a big power plant there and this one right here, that's an air force base. And Denise was killed near a reservoir. Somebody's testing our strengths and our weaknesses, figuring out the best way to bring us down. What does that livestock have to do with that theory? Maybe they're testing our biology too. Come on. This is too much. I mean I can buy the idea that maybe this is some sort of secret government weather weapon that got out of control or maybe the Chinese or somebody like that are sending these things over to mess with us but tornadoes trying to figure out our biology, no. I know it sounds crazy. It sure does and I don't like the idea that we might be the only two lunatics in the asylum. Mackey. Listen Norm, something very strange is going on with these tornadoes. You gotta get somebody to call the governor or somebody like that. I'm in West Bend. Tornado took out half the town. Norm. Norm! Twister just took out West Bend. Let's go. Well his car is here. Yeah but he's not in it. Norm! Sheriff Mackey! Norm! I'm over here! Judd! Help! Alright, we're here, buddy! My foot's stuck under this damn tree! You okay? I'm just stuck. Anything broken? Nah, I'm alright. What happened, buddy? Those tornadoes. They're attacking. They're looking for a fight. What are you doing out here? I got a report those MIBs were scoping out the place so I thought I'd just come out and take a look. When did the two of you bury the hatchet? Hey Barney, that's fast. Gail, what's going on? Are you messing with me, girl? What do you mean? I just ran your file through some pattern matching software and I got a huge hit. Great, so what is it? NASA, air force, what? It's not one of ours, that's for sure. Oh, so it's foreign. You could say that. So who is it? China, North Korea, who? Try Alpha Centauri. Come on, Barney. I need you to be serious, please. I'm dead serious. Have you ever heard of the Wow signal? Yeah, 1977. Some guys from CETI thought that they intercepted some alien transmission but it never repeated, right? Bingo. That file you sent me, it's an exact match. Mutilated cattle. Men in black. So what's next, flying saucers? Speak of the devil. What did you do? What did we do? Two of my men are dead, Ms. Curtis. You were there. Sticking your nose where it doesn't belong. Now this. They've never interfered with us before. Who's they? The signal is extraterrestrial, isn't it? Extraterrestrial, are you talking about like ET? Who told you that? What does it matter who the hell told him? Those things are headed for Chicago. We'd better start warning people. You've got your facts all wrong, Mr... Judd Walker. This is a meteorological phenomenon and we're studying it. Armstrong. Yes, I'm on the scene now. The damage is total. I think we can confirm hostile intent. And we have one more complication. The Curtis woman knows about the Nimbus. I don't know. Sir, they already are suspicious. I think that's gonna make them all the more suspicious. Yes. Yes. I understand. Hey, what do you think you're doing? This is my jurisdiction. Meteorological phenomena. That's why you're having us arrested? I'm not arresting you. We're putting you in protective custody to keep you from running around the countryside getting yourselves killed. Norm, Norm! Listen, mister. No, you listen to me! This situation is way above your pay grade. I make one phone call and you are out of a job. Is that what you want? Hm? No. I didn't think so. It appears our cowboy lives on a farm next door to the tracking station where the alpha incident occurred. He and the girl know about the Nimbus so either there's been a massive security breach or they've discovered something we haven't seen. The committee wants us to go take a look and that is what we're going to do. Sheriff, you have a lovely office. Thank you for the use of it. Look, I don't know who the hell you think you are but I represent the people of this county. And I represent the people of these United States. Who's got the bigger job? Bigger job. Bigger jackass. Hang on. I ran the plates on that black SUV. I got nothing. Thank you. What's going on, Norm? You two must really have a bug up somebody's butt. Just get us out of here. I can't do that, this is my job. This badge is all I got. People's lives are at stake and you're worried about your damn job. Look, this Armstrong is as serious as heart attack and the federal government is behind this. What do you think you can do that they can't do? Warn people, Norm. This thing is escalating, man. Do you understand this is more than a couple of isolated twisters we're talking about? Just what are you talking about? Mars, ETs? This is way beyond my area of expertise. Now what do you think that you two can do that the federal government can't do better? Fine. If you're not gonna do anything, at least get a hold of my daughter, will ya? I will call Kelly. Kelly, this is Norm. As soon as you get this message, call me. It's about your dad. It's an emergency. She's in danger. We all are. You gotta find her, Norm. Please. I'll find her. Man, what the hell do you think you're doing? Sheriff, don't make me tell you again, stay out of our way. Where's Kelly? She's gone. It looks like there's trouble in the heartland. Chicago, these things are going to Chicago. Sir, I think you should see this. I pulled up her recent activity log and this is what popped up on her blog. This is Kelly Walker and I'm recording this for posterity. A couple hours ago, I intercepted what I think might be an extraterrestrial radio signal. Here, check it out. Pretty cool, huh? Well I think it might have something to do with the tornadoes we've been having. If I can prove that actual aliens are messing with our atmosphere, I'll be up there with Einstein, Newton, Galileo, even. If that's not scholarship material, well, I don't know what is. Parnell, Cox, find her. And? For now just find her. That's what you're gonna do, arrest a 17 year old girl? Don't worry, sheriff. She'll be safer with my men than she will be on her own. What's your big plan? We have contingencies. Contingencies. There's a chain of command, sheriff. I follow it. I suggest you follow it too. Just be grateful we let you tag along. Excuse me. There is no plans. You're just making this stuff up as you go along and hoping this whole thing will blow over. Blow over. Oh, that's clever. Be careful, sheriff, because clever isn't always smart. Chicago? Are you sure? Look, I found it out at the farm with some of Armstrong's guys. They found a video that she posted on the web. She knows about the ETs and she can prove it. He sent some of his men out to get her. You gotta let us out, Norm. Judd, there's something I gotta tell you. What? You said that I couldn't hack it in the big city. You's telling the truth. What are you talking about? We were supposed to go pick up a suspect. I was coming in the back of the building. I didn't see a gun. I froze. I let him go. After that, everybody said that I couldn't be trusted. So you ran away. Look, following Armstrong isn't the first dumb decision I've ever made. Well now you have a chance to make a right one. Let us out. Kelly Walker? Never heard of her. I'm Agent Cox. This is Agent Parnell. Your father sent us. Where is he? Chicago. What is he doing in Chicago? He's helping us with our investigation. Here, get in. We'll take you to him. Or you could walk. It's your choice. Guys, do we have to lock the doors? Never trust a stranger, kid. You're out now, what do you do? Alert the media. We contact radio stations, TV stations, whoever will listen to us. I'm with you there but my daughter comes first. Okay, I've got an idea. I'll contact the radio stations because they're more likely to listen to a cop. Hey look, take the keys to the cruiser. Anything happen to my car comes out of my salary. Here's the keys to my truck. It's still out in connector three. Alright, take my cellphone. If I hear anything, I'll call you. Great, thank you. Operator. Emergency. This is Sheriff Mackey. I need the phone numbers for every major radio station in Chicago. I'm sure our listeners will have a lot to say about this issue so let's take some calls. Alright, I see we have a Sheriff Norm Mackey from Lando County on line three. Hello sheriff, you're on the air. Hello, this is Sheriff Mackey. I am calling about the tornadoes that we're having that the news services saying that we're not having. Yeah, actually, our topic today is the deficit, sheriff, but we all wish to weather the coming storm, financially speaking, as best we can. Let's try to stay on point, shall we? But these things are aliens and that's why they're denying everything. This is area 51 all over again. I see. Look, this is not a joke. I don't know what they want, I don't know where they're from but this is not... Gary, supposed to be screening these calls. They will lock up anybody that mentions... If you can't do your job, I'll find somebody who can. Hello? Hello? There's the bus. Kelly? Hey Judd, maybe she wasn't even on this bus. Yes she was. Okay, don't jump to any conclusions. There were no bodies. Maybe everybody got out safely. Norm. It didn't work. Who did you call? I called a radio station. As soon as they put me on the air and I mentioned aliens, it was open season on the crazy man. Yeah, we need proof. Proof? How do I get proof that aliens sent twisters to destroy Chicago? You have to try again. Go to Channel 37. It's the station I worked for when I was a storm chaser. Use my name. Tell them there's gonna be a major tornado outbreak heading towards Chicago. I have to warn people. Tell people to get down into their basements and stay there. Okay. Look, I will give it a... Norm? Norm! Mr. Walker, Ms. Curtis, I presume. Armstrong? Tell Judd we have his daughter. Where is she? We're taking her to one of our safe houses in the city until you two turn yourselves in. If we're right, Armstrong, there aren't gonna be any safe houses in Chicago or anywhere else. That's just the type of hysterical paranoia we're trying to prevent, Mr. Walker. Let's both be reasonable. Put our cards on the table. We know about the livestock mutilations. You know about the Nimbus. We know about the signal your daughter recorded. The Nimbus? Is that what you call 'em? It's a code name. What do they want? We don't communicate with them directly. They're not exactly on our wavelength. Look. The connections you've made are making my bosses very nervous and I've been instructed to prevent any further leakage. How long do you think it's gonna take for someone else to make the same connections? I don't deal in hypotheticals. All I can do is prevent a panic but it seems like everything you do is trying to incite one. Armstrong, I'm coming to get my daughter. If anything happens to her... That's a problem. The pattern's changed again. Yes. I think we're looking at the worst case scenario. Yes, I'm on my way to the airport now. I'm hungry. Can you pull over please? Pull over here and I'll run across the street and grab her a taco. I'm getting out too. No way, kid. I have to pee. Not happening. I told you I have to pee. Can't you wait? This is a government issued vehicle, right? So? So I watch TV. You guys have to sign for these things which means you're responsible for any damages like urine stains on the upholstery for example. You try one thing, okay, and I will... You'll what? You'll spank me? In your dreams, loser. Parnell. Go right over here. Help, help! I'm being kidnapped! Please! Let go of me! Back up, guys. Official federal business. Back up, federal agent! Federal agent! Back up, federal agents! She's that way, let's go. Did you get through? Dad? Kelly. I tried calling but no one answered. Why are you on Norm's phone? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Dad, I'm sorry that I left without telling you, I just, I wasn't thinking. Don't worry about it, honey. Where are you? Chicago. And this tornado hit and killed everyone on our bus and then these guys in suits showed up and they said that you were with them and then I went with them. Don't listen to them. They're lying about everything. They're trying to cover this up. Are you still with them? No, I ditched them. Where are you now? Careful, they could be monitoring the call. Honey, don't say anything. They might be listening to you. We've gotta figure out where to meet. I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be at Norm's favorite restaurant. Norm's favorite restaurant. Great idea, honey. Go there and wait for us. Dad. Please hurry. I will, baby, I will. So where does Norm like to eat? The Filling Station on Union Avenue. Best hot dogs in Chicago. That's right, that's right. Oh my god. This is not good. Dad! Dad! Kelly! Dad! Oh my god. I'm so sorry. I promise not to scare you like that again. That's alright. Oh my god. I saw it, it was like a tornado but it was different. It had three funnel clouds. One storm? One storm, three funnels, all interconnected. How do they do it? How do they manipulate air flow so precisely? There was a signal that came to me on the bus and I re-broadcasted the signal and it just went away. Are you saying that a tornado responded to this signal directly? Yes. Are you sure, Kelly? Yes, it saved my life. Oh my god. What? Whatever technology they're using to actually spawn these twisters, the commands must be coming from somewhere else. They're not from here, are they? They're alien and this is their signal to stop. Dad, this is first contact. So they can be controlled. I think so. What do we do now? Now we find a transmission tower and we amplify the signal. Let's go. The bastards took out the ballpark. Oh no. There's been a change of plan. Take us to the nearest television station. We've got an announcement to make. Come on, baby. I know you can go faster than this. Barney, I need you out of that apartment. You know I'm agoraphobic and the city's in chaos. I don't wanna hear it, Barn. Just get your butt to Channel 37 as fast as you can and bring everything you have on that signal. Channel 37? I used to work there. The station manager owes me a favor. Take care of the family, alright? All of you, just follow them. Take care now. Be careful. Griff. Yeah, we'll you, I understand, just keep us on the air... Mike. Gail! Oh honey. Holy, you haven't lost your sense of timing, have you? The Willis Tower just went down, do you believe that? It's like 9/11 around here. Now I mean, I have my crew. I sent 'em home to their families. It's just me and a skeleton crew right now. Listen to me. Remember when I brought you that exclusive coverage from the Macon County storm and you said to me that if ever I needed a favor, just say it? I remember that, yeah, yeah. I'm here to collect. Please, honey, honey. I'm a little busy right now. Can it wait? It's all related. Well it'd better be. Homeland security, they just commandeered my studio. Homeland security? For some public announcement they wanna make. I have to give you people credit. You are persistent. Wait a minute. You two know each other? If by know you mean dislike intensely, then yes. Sheriff's department, I need to see somebody in charge here. Norm! Kelly. Mike, listen to me. They are not from homeland security. They are not telling you the truth. They are trying to cover this thing up. The situation has changed, Ms. Curtis. We're about to go on the air to warn the public. Congratulations, you got what you wanted. You're gonna tell the people what's really going on? We're gonna tell them what they need to know to survive. I thought you said five minutes. Five minutes, seven minutes, what the hell. Alright, come on, let's do this, guys. Alright, this is live. It's gonna be live. Five. Four, three, two. My fellow citizens. A massive storm system is bearing down on the Chicago metropolitan area. Multiple F5 tornadoes with winds in excess of 350 miles an hour are reported. We are asking you to find shelter in basements if you have them and turn off all electronic equipment. I repeat, turn off all electronic equipment. This is not a drill. For your own safety and the safety of your families, stay indoors. Stay where you are until further notice. Thank you. Thank you very much. We're out. Alright. Turn off all electronic equipment? EMP. You're going nuclear. You're gonna nuke a major city? Relax. No one is nuking anything. This can't be happening. This isn't right here. That's not the only thing. We're being attacked. Attacked? By who? Aliens. Aliens? What? Suddenly you're all afraid to say it. The girl is right, of course. We've known about their existence for years. Data packets. Quantum state vectors. Traveling through the universe near light speed. No physical bodies. No need for spaceships. We're being attacked by ghosts. More like energy creatures. They manipulate our weather because it's the only thing they can manipulate in our environment. Why are they doing this? Maybe they were attracted to our planet because of radio emissions. But something's changed. Maybe our bandwidth is so clogged with so much information that they can't hear themselves think. Maybe they've had enough. Armstrong. Yes, will advise. Go in security. Armstrong. We can stop this. Kelly recorded a transmission. She proved it could turn them back. I'm only gonna tell you this once, Ms. Curtis. Park your mouth or you're gonna spend the rest of this emergency in handcuffs. Or maybe that's what you want. That goes for all of you. Who the hell does he think he is? Northbound Reports Network has gone hot. 15 minutes to antenna synchronization. 15 minutes to antenna synchronization. Oh Barney. You made it, thank god, you made it. Well I almost didn't. Freaking storm took my hat off. It's Katrina times 10 out there. Gail, you know I'm agoraphobic and I don't leave my basement! I'm sorry to put you through that, Barney. Look. I got another one of those signals on disk. It's almost spanning the whole band of that EM spectrum. Not someone, something. You recorded another one? Who's this? This is Kelly. She's the one who got the first signal on tape. Good work. Yeah, let me hear it. That's what I have. It's not the same. The signals are instructions. Then this has to be a whole different command set. If we wanna know what they're talking about, we have to find a pattern. Something's coming in from Synchronization complete. 10 seconds to pulse activation. Alright everybody. Unless you want your circuits fried, turn off all electronic equipment now. Wait a minute. The only thing other than a nuke with that much power would be a network of ultra wide band radar arrays. That's what you're doing, isn't it? That's classified. How the hell did you know that? You can't classify basic scientific principles. Three seconds. Two. One. Damn, not the power. Stay calm. Damn it. This part of your plan? Sitreps, did we get them? Checking now. Short north com reports there's a problem. What, what, what... The EMP did not work. Satellite imagery shows that the storms are actually increasing in strength. No, no, no, no. That's inconceivable. No. Sir, north com reports the storm should be right on top of us. Everybody in the basement. Come on, people, let's go... Wait, wait, give me a second. Okay. You need to switch those up 'cause if you don't, we're back to where we were. Come people, let's go, now, now. Hold on, man! We're all on the same team now! They're on to something, just hear 'em out. We can use the station's transmitter to broadcast the alien signal back to them. Send them away. It worked once before. Maybe it'll work again. It doesn't make sense! The pulse, the pulse should've killed them. Maybe it did! Maybe that's why the storms are getting worse. You cut off the head and the body keeps moving. Now they're out of control. Fine. Try your signal. Guys, I need that file. Won't work. What do you mean? Means I was wrong. That wasn't the command for stop. It was just a directional vector, latitude and longitude. It's just gonna send that tornado right back to Lando. How do you know that? Because we compared the different signals and we found patterns. Enough to use frequency analysis to make educated guesses about syntax. It's just a simple binary cipher that uses base 11 positional notation. That's it. That sounds great, honey. Can you give me that in English? It means they cracked the alien code. What? It was mostly her. Your daughter's a natural at this. Of course she is, she takes after her mother. No, I take after you. So Barney, what about the second signal? Will that one work? Yeah, it should. What are we waiting for? If we can talk to them, why don't we shut the bastards down? I have the kill command ready. I just need access to the transmitter. Mike. Mike, the transmitter? Yeah. Yeah, I can patch us into the main control booth from here. Alright. Just a second. Alright. Here. Alright, make sure that that... Hold on. Double check that. Alright. Okay. I hope this works. Why wouldn't it? Oh, I said that out loud, I'm sorry. Performance anxiety. Alright, you're good to go. Alright, we're all ready. Did you send it? No, I needed another second. I've got flashlights. I've got flashlights here! Here, here, here. Alright. You know, must be the genny but no one's been up there in years. So what does that mean? It means that we're out of gas, propane, or whatever it uses. Kelly, go to the basement. Dad, I'm not leaving. Listen to me, you did a fantastic job, great. But please go to the basement now. Please. Okay. Thank you. An operation this size must be diesel. Where is it? It's on the roof. On the roof? Who designed this place? The guy that designed the Titanic? Is it a separate fuel shed? No, yes. Well I'm not sure. Well I haven't been up there... Alright, calm down. Mike. Just show me where you think it is. This way. Stay put, Barney. I almost forgot this place was here. Here, here, right here, right here. That's it. Move it. Alright, keys. Come on. Alright, alright. Okay. Okay. This is gonna work. This is, it's gonna work. Sir, we just got a clean up and contain order from committee. All other priorities rescinded. They mentioned the Curtis woman specifically. Give me that. This is Armstrong. Repeat last order. What do we do? These people cracked a code we didn't even see. They're trying to save lives. They're doing a better job than we have. Gentlemen, sometimes orders aren't meant to be followed. If you have a problem with that, say so now. Alright, let's saddle up. Let's go do some good. It looks like you could use some help. Sounds like a good idea to me. No thanks, I got it. Gail. Damn it, Judd, I'm not letting anyone else risk their life for me. Somebody's gotta stay here and send the signal. Yeah, yeah, let's go. Here's the keys to use on that generator cage. Yeah, now you guys just have fun. We'll just stand by and wait for you. Are the stairs down here? Down at the end of the hall. Judd, hurry. Yes ma'am. Alright, alright. He can do it, he can do it. There it is! Barney. Kelly, what are you doing here? You're supposed to be downstairs. Where's dad? Somebody had to refuel the generator. Why him? Because he wanted it done right. He'll be okay, I promise. He will, sweetie, he will, he will. This is it! Two cans should do it! Judd, these things are right on top of us! You go back, Norm. And what do I tell Kelly if you don't come back? Just go! Look out! Norm, let's get up! Let's get inside! Let's go! We're back in business, people! Come on. Thank you, Judd. Send it now! Huh? The radar. The radar doesn't show anything! The skies are clear! We're almost home. Our heroes, there they are! Oh my god, dad! Oh my god. Hey, are you okay? Ah, it's nothing, Kelly, just my ankle. That was really stupid. That goes for the both of you. Tell me about it. Dad. Dad. Chi-town ain't got nothing on this. You got that right. Delivery for Ms. Kelly Walker. But wait a second, that can't be right. University of Malaysia? Oh my god! I got in! Oh my god! Don't thank me, thank the US government. They're the ones footing the bill and you can thank Ms. Curtis. She got us such a great attorney. So good, matter of fact, that attorney thinks he's gonna get your job back in the big city. Ah, no thanks. I'm staying right here. I finally found something I'm good at. What are you gonna do in Malaysia? Not gonna be brushing horses, I can tell you that. Where do you go from here? Well technically I can run a website from anywhere so I was thinking about maybe sticking around for a while. Got something on your mind, cowboy? Well they're having a little shindig over at the town hall this Saturday. Yeah? I thought maybe if you weren't busy, ah, maybe it's a bad idea. Men.
