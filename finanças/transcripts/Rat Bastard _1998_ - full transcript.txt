(ominous electronic music) (men chanting in foreign language) (objects squelching) (dramatic orchestral music) - [Alarm] Wake up. (Jeeter screams) (Tasmanian devil grumbles) - Fuck this. (uptempo rock music) (bells jingle) (bag rustles) This and a pack of classic menthol 100s, please. - Never heard the word cholesterol before? - Yeah, I have, but-- - And since when do you smoke menthols? - Since I was 13. - Man, don't you know what they put in those things? That shit'll kill you. - Gee, didn't know that. - Did you know that when we bought Colorado from the Indians, us pale faces actually tried to trade with menthol cigarettes? The Indians, they were smart, though. They went with the smallpox infected blankets instead. - Look man, I just want a pack of-- - Try these, Old Injun smokes. They're all natural and none of that crap in 'em. - [Jeeter] I don't want those, I want-- - And what is this I hear about you reading Kafka? - Wait, how did you know? No, not anymore, that shit was freakin' me out. - You know, most scholars feel that The Metamorphoses is actually autobiographical, about Kafka's relationship with his father and all, but when I read it, I can't get away from the religious imagery, myself. - Look man, I just came here for a pack of smokes, okay? - Well Butch, I guess there's no talkin' to some people. Menthol-smokin' neo-realist motherfucker. - Yeah. (people chattering) (machine beeping) (folder thuds) (midtempo jazz music) - Tell 'em today, two weeks' notice. Out of here by the end of the month. (Gwen sighs) - You know what's right. You know you must follow the straight to narrow. You know you must never stray from your path because if you never stray from your path, the sky's the limit. And you know there will be many temptations that will try to lead you astray, but you know you must always fly straight. - Mr. Dudley, can I speak with you for a second? - Must you always do that? - Sorry. - Sit down, Gwen. There's something we need to discuss. - Well, actually Mr. Dudley, there's something important-- - [Mr. Dudley] Have we ever talked about hardware? - Well, yes-- - No, I mean really spoken about it and all of its implications? - Well, actually-- - For instance, do you realize that if it weren't for us here at Hardware Heaven that thousands of men all over the greater Canton area would have nothing to do on Sundays than spend time with their wives and kids? What I'm saying is, we have a responsibility here. - Right. - Responsibility as in getting your facts straight. - What do you mean? - I was golfing with Mr. Jacobson yesterday. Mr. Jacobson, the vice president. And I mentioned to him what you told me about last quarter's figures showing a significant drop in retail sales and that we should be concerned. - Right, and it's all in the report-- - He nearly laughed me off the fifth green. He said retail sales were up 7% last quarter. - Mr. Dudley, I explained this to you. Yes, retail sales are up 7%. However, among men ages 28 to 45, which is our prime sales demographic, sales are down over 12%, and yes, that is a reason for us, well, for the company, to be concerned. - You never explained that to me. - Yes, I did. - And what as my reaction? - Well, you liked how I put all the numbers into little neat rows. - Yes, yes, well. You keep that up. But keep your facts straight next time. Now, I have a golf game tomorrow morning with Ms. Casner, the president. And I'm sure you're aware, Ms. Casner is a, she's a, um, she's a woman. So I'll need some help from you to deal with her. - My help? - First, I'll need some facts that will impress her. Good ones, happy ones, you know. And I'll need for you to go out and pick something up, a gift, perhaps. Something nice. - Mr. Dudley, all the facts you need are in the report, and I've explained it to you four times now. As to a gift or whatever, I'm sure your secretary can handle that. - No, no, can't do that. Ivana's getting waxed, we have a dinner engagement tonight. God, I hope she wears that angora sweatshirt-- - Not that it's really that important, but it's not part of my job. - Excuse me. I am the comptroller. You are an accountant's assistant. If I say it's your job, it's your job. - Mr. Dudley, I'm not going over that report with you again, and I don't have the time to do all your shopping for you. - (chuckles) Okay. Okay, I get it now. Look, Gwen, all you need to do is talk to housekeeping and ask them to replenish the tampon machine in the ladies' room. And then, once you take care of, well, whatever, then you can get right on this. - I cannot believe you just said that to me. - What've you got there? - This. I'm. A gift, huh? - That's my girl. Yes, something thoughtful, but not forward. Use my corporate card. - No, I need cash. - Cash, huh? Will it make me look good? - Oh, I'm sure tomorrow's gonna be a banner day for you, sir. - Excellent, here. Here's $50. Put whatever you were doing aside, this takes priority. And take as long as you need-- - The rest of today? - Well, if you really think that's necessary. - Oh, I have something very special in mind for you, sir. - Great. Just be sure to be here tomorrow morning so you can explain the rest of this stuff to me again. - All right, bright and early, Mr. Dudley. - That little filly's a shoo-in for employee of the month. - [Reporter] Pathfinder has made successful work of surveying the red planet. There are some people who think that a search for the infamous face on Mars should get underway. NASA officials took the time to explain to this group of people that this face, or head as they called it, was a promotional ploy for NASA's forthcoming theme park Face World. They were then put in a very dark room and told not to come out until the lights came on. - Principles of Government, Thursdays, 11 o'clock. (Jeeter knocking) - [Reporter] The owners of a Route 6 shopping plaza from the very start. (Jeeter knocking) And for landscaping. The county and city officials weren't available for comment. (Jeeter knocking) - [Mik] Come in! - Hey. - [Mik] You're early today. - Wanted to give you back that 20 bucks you loaned me. Don't look so surprised. I wanted to make sure you got it before I spent it. - Where'd you get the money? - Mrs. Ketterman. She gave me a few bucks advance on the job I'm gonna do for her. - Oh, so you are working today. - No. Now she's trying to decide between light blue and aqua. To tell you the truth, I can't even tell the difference. - Aqua is the color of the ocean, light blue is the color of the sky. I thought you were an artist. - I am an artist, Mik. - So in other words, you're not working today. - Actually, I'm starting an important project today. (phone ringing) - Shit, I'm gonna be late. Early, I have inspection today. Do me a favor, can you take that paperback to K? He needed it. - Sure. - Okay. - See you tonight, same time? - Sounds good. - All right, bye. - Go. - And lock the door. - Have a good day! - [Man] And I'll get back to you. - [Gwen] Mik? It's Gwen, remember I said I'd stop by on my way to New York? Well, it's gonna be a little sooner than I thought, like tomorrow. Be there by one, okay? Bye. (midtempo rock music) (Jeeter knocking) - K. (knocking) Anybody? Hey man, what the hell? - Shh. (tires screeching) - Here, this is from Mik. (gun firing) What is this? - Cannon. (tires screeching) Do you ever wonder how this show was pitched to the networks? I mean, before any show gets on the air, someone's gotta go to the network brass and sell 'em on the idea, right? - Mm. - So somebody say in head honcho's office and said, hey, I got this great idea for a show. It's about a private investigator. Now, I know you've heard this before, but in this show, the private investigator is this really huge fat guy. It's fuckin' genius. (sighs) You workin' today? - Yeah, I'm starting a big project today. - Oh, dude speakin' of big projects, I hear we're pitching this big promotion job, I can't wait. Finally, something different. You up tonight? - [Man] Hey, you're squashin' the pizza! - Yeah, I'll be there for a little while. - (laughs) He's jumpin' over the fence. - What time are you supposed to go in? - I'm supposed to be about nine. Tick's on next. (somber rock music) (phone ringing) - [Mrs. Ketterman] Hello, Mr. Jankovitch. It's Mrs. Ketterman. I've decided on beige for the spare bedroom. Mm, well, maybe eggshell. I guess I'll let you know later, bye bye. - Old people suck.

You got 10 seconds to tell me-- - Where's my 200 bucks? - Jerzey, you'll get your money, you always do, okay? - Yeah. Usually a week or two late. You know, if I wanted to, I could kick your ass out for this. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! My dad's away, and I'm in charge of the building now, so I'm not gonna put up with any of your starving artist bullshit. I can handle this place myself, and I'm starting with you, you little parasite. - Yeah, I'm the parasite. - Hey, don't talk back to me, punk! And don't think I'm kiddin' about the 200 bucks or about kicking you out. - Look Jerzey, your dad and I have an understanding, okay? I'll talk to him if you want me to-- - I said I was in charge here! Oh! (midtempo rock music) So let's hear it. - Let's hear what? - Look, I don't know, some kind of lame excuse or some loser attempt to beg me to let you stay here. - Gee sorry, Jerzey, it's just not gonna be your day, is it? - Don't think I'm kiddin' about the money. I want all the money! Tomorrow! Noon! I can't wait to see you beg me to let you stay here. You're gonna say, oh, Jerzey, please! Oh please, let me stay here! Oh, it's so cold outside, oh please! Please don't kick me out in the cold, cold street! Oh, I'm homeless and it's snowing, oh help me! - It's August, Jerzey. - Hey, that's not the point! - We got work to do, okay? Look, don't think this hasn't been a big bowl of pork rinds. - You just better have my money. Hey! (door thuds) (uptempo rock music) (Jerzey sniffs) (man groaning) (midtempo instrumental music) - (scoffs) What the hell is this? - Door jamb sticker. See, I had this idea. I write a lot of bumper stickers for cars, right? So I'm thinkin' hey, why don't they have bumper stickers for houses and apartments, you know? So that people could express themselves that way if, you know, they don't have a car. Check it out. - My other house is a condo. Big knockers welcome. - You get that? - Do you really think there's a lot of people who have houses that don't have cars? - It's a whole new market. I've already sold some on my own. - Well, it's kind of interesting in a demented sort of way. - [Roger] Have you talked to Fred about it? - No, not really. You know him, he wouldn't get it. - No, I'd give it a shot. I mean, he's always asking for new ideas, and business being what it is. - I don't know, I mean, I never really talk to him much anyway. - Whoops, here you go. - Oh, did I interrupt something? - No, not at all. - You're sure? - [Roger] Yeah, why? - Well, I'd hate to think I was interrupting such a meeting of the minds. I'm sure what you two were discussing was something very important. The cure for cancer, maybe? - Yeah, Roger here actually seems to put a lot of faith in genetic engineering, whereas I, on the other hand-- - A smart ass is not what I need right now. We've all got work to do. Now, where are those new bumper stickers? - They're almost ready, another day or two. - Oh, wait a minute. You said that last week. - It's the creative process, I'm a writer. I need to be inspired. - K, you right bumper stickers. And I still think that that paycheck I manage to write for you every two weeks would be inspiration enough. - Wait, I got this great idea, hold on. A bumper sticker that says hit the road. Get it, road? Cars? - (chuckles) K, you're a decent guy. I like your work, and usually I like you. But don't make me have to put you in a straight jacket and drop you in the middle of nowhere, okay? There's a new guy who's coming into town, and he's thinking about opening up this new punk club. Now this could be a great project for us, but I'm going to need your help. We're going to need creative drawings and fancy artwork. Start thinking about that, will you please? (midtempo rock music) - Can I do something for you, Bill? - Well, I did a little inspection earlier this morning. What the hell is this? - A spatula? - Notice anything peculiar about it? - Gee, I don't think so-- - Look closer, asshole. Not exactly the cleanest spatula you ever saw in your life now, is it? - Well, no-- - And guess what? - But, I-- - You know how I built this business, kid? I built it one pancake at a time, and do you know why? Because people kept coming back for my pancakes. Why, because they like my pancakes. They're good pancakes, they're clean pancakes, and you can't make clean pancakes with a dirty spatula. - I'm sorry, sir, this won't happen again. - You see? You all laughed when I put the names on the spatulas, but now you know why. - Um, Bill, I know this may not be the best time, but remember we talked about my getting Thursdays off, well-- - Hey, just do what I pay you for, huh? - Yo, Saturday's special, extra flapjacks! - They're not flapjacks, they're pancakes, god damn it! - God, I need a drink. (lively rock music) - Miss? Excuse me, ma'am? - It's Ms. - Oh, pardon me, but could I trouble you with-- - You're not gonna hit on me, right? - Oh, blimey, no, actually, I just wanted-- - You come in here, you see a woman in a subservient role, and you just figure she's yours for the taking, don't you? - Really, I just wanted to ask you if this place is always this dead, you see-- - I know exactly who you are. You are a spineless sack of sperm that sees the writing on the wall. You know the end of male tyranny is at hand, and you're confused. You are scared. You're just waking up to the reality that that appendage you worship is not the motive power of the universe, and you just don't know what to do, do you? - Can, um, I-- - Well, here's an idea-- - Get the check? - Why don't you crawl back into your little cesspool with all your other male buddies and stop harassing a hard-working woman trying to earn a living! God! - This tip's gonna be easy to figure out. - This yours, man? - Oh, thanks, man. ♪ Rock and roll, rollin' her eye ♪ ♪ And you put beside ♪ - [Jeeter] Sorry guys, I was workin'. - You didn't work today. - For a shot? - No, I gotta get in early. Billy reamed me out today, and I gotta get up and give my work area a thorough cleaning. - Oh yeah, hey, congratulations. Employee of the month. - Don't even get me started about work. I got this great idea nobody wants to hear about. - What, you mean those door things? - They're called door jamb stickers. All I need is an investor, and I'll make a fortune. - What about Freaky Freddy? - My boss just bought a truckload of rubber shit. The party vomit did really great last month. - So how are you gonna find an investor? - I don't know, I'll find some buy with a lot of money-- - Who's stupid enough to give some to you. - Bingo. Besides, I come in contact with a lot of wealthy types down at Fred's. You know, bankers, business owners, guys like that. I'm gonna start hittin' 'em up. - Where did you get this idea from, anyway? - Same place I get all my ideas. - Jesus Christ. - It's a known fact that during sex, all your senses are heightened. You're more aware, you're definitely more creative. Not that you'd know that, though. - Hey, I hold my own. - I bet you do. - What do you men want now? - Um, I'll have Yeungling. Can I have a black and tan, though. Black and tan? - Sure. - Nah, just a draft for me. - You know, for once Jeeter, you might wanna try a real bear. - I want a draft. - All right. - Oh, and can I get some barbecue pork rinds? - Will the oppression ever end? (sighs) Oh, God. - Why do we always have to sit back here? No chicks ever come back here. - He likes to sit underneath his painting. - Fuck you. - [K] Why not just hang the damn painting in his apartment and sit under it there? - Speaking of your apartment, I got a really interesting call at work today from your landlord. Oh, and thanks, by the way, for using me as your reference. - My landlord called you? - Yeah, Jerzey. - Jerzey is not my landlord. - Well, when his dad's out of town, he seems to think he is. - [Jeeter] What does he want with you? - He said he was over to get some overdue rent and that you were abusive. - Oh, come on. - He also said that you were on the verge of getting kicked out. - Look Mik, I'll be fine, okay? - Okay. So you got any work lined up today? - Well, actually, Ketterman changed her mind. Now she's trying to decide between beige and eggshell. - Eggshell's a lot lighter than beige. - Speaking of Mrs. Ketterman, what did you do with that money you claimed she gave you? - Bought some supplies. - What? - Remember, I told you, I started an important project so I needed some supplies. - What important project? - Self-portrait. - Guy's got vision. - You spent Mrs. Ketterman's money on supplies for you? - Mik, what am I supposed to do? I can't buy her paint until she decides on a color. Besides, I needed this stuff. - You are unbelievable. He's gonna get kicked out again. - The landlord will get his money. - How is he gonna get his money when you spend all of your time in front of that goddamn easel instead of out looking for a real job? - You know what, let me take care of my business and you just keep on flippin' your flapjacks. - They're not flapjacks, they're pancakes. - Yeah, whatever. - Hey, gainfully employed, responsible. - You know, we're gonna be needing some artwork for this new client down at Fred's. I could hook you up, dude. - You need the cash, what's the big deal? - Look guys, will you just play the damn game, all right? - What the hell is wrong with you? Here he is offering you a paying job and you sit there like. - K, I don't want the work, all right? I'm busy enough as it is. - What, spankin' off on canvas all day? - Jeeter, Jeeter. Think fruit. - Fruit. - Flower vases. - Yeah, seascapes and nice winter scenes, things like that. You know, I'm sure if you wanted to, you could probably crank out one or two of those a day. - Please tell me you guys aren't serious. - Every hotel buys that crap. - No! - Take me. The bumper stickers and stuff pays the bills and keeps me in CKB. Chicks dig that stuff, but that's not what I'm about. You know that head on Mars? You know that one in the tabloid? - Yeah, mm-hm. - Well, imagine it's not a head. (midtempo rock music) (glasses thudding) - I expect repugnant behavior from these two men, but I thought you'd be a little sensitive to the plight of my gender. I thought you were an artist. - I am an artist. - Anthills. Giant anthills, filled with these huge, flesh-eating ants that will attack the Earth to satisfy their blood lust. (laughs) It's scary, huh? - Can I read it? - Well, it's just an idea right now. I'm writing it, it's in my head. - I'd rather paint the giant ants than the damn fruit. - [Mik] Well, you better do something soon. Don't come looking for my help again. - Can I have a drink of fuckin' beer without you giving me this shit? - Whoa, whoa, did you guys just see the blonde that just walked in here? - No, where? - Oh man, what a biscuit. See you guys tomorrow. - [Jeeter] Oh, by the way, you got a call this morning. - Oh yeah, from whom? - Your cousin Gwen. - [Mik] Yeah, so what'd she want? - I don't know, something about coming in tomorrow. - Now she's not, she's not coming for three weeks. - Well, she said tomorrow. One o'clock. - Oh, shit. Look, can you do me a favor? - What is that? - [Mik] Can you be at my house tomorrow when she shows up? I have to work tomorrow. Some of us have jobs. - [Jeeter] Say please. - Would you please be at my apartment tomorrow at one? - Pretty please? - Would you, fuck this. Are you gonna be at my apartment or not? - All right, all right, all right, I'll go. - All right. - I guess my not working's coming in pretty handy, huh? - Look, it'll only be a few hours. (glass slams) - Next time your buddy runs outta here to take advantage of some innocent woman, tell him not to leave his glass on the damn condom machine, okay? (sighs) (birds chirping) (playful instrumental music) (spoon tapping) - I'll never get used to this. - Ah. (laughs) Protein. - Pork rind? - [K] Christ, don't make me sick. Where you off to so early? - I gotta go to Mik's later so I figured I might as well just work there all day. - What's he want you there for? - His cousin's coming to visit. Wants someone to be there when she gets in. - She? - Yes, K. Her name is Gwen. - What time's she gonna be there? - I don't know, sometime around one, I think. - One, huh? Hey, you wanna hear about last night? - You know what, that's okay, K. I gotta go. - Stealin' candy, hey, what does Mik want you to do with-- - Gwen. - Whatever. - I don't know, I guess we'll find out, won't we. - Gwen, that sounds good. Do you know what she looks like? - Do you ever stop, K? - Hey, I'm a grown boy. You haven't had a girlfriend since that scarred chick about six months ago. - Hey, hey, hey, I want you to lay off Diane, okay? She was having her wisdom teeth taken out. - Yeah, (chuckles) through her face. - (Sighs) She won the lawsuit, didn't she? - Yeah, and dropped you like a cold happy meal. Nice FUTAs, though. - FUTAs? - Female upper torso appendages. Seriously, have you even touched a woman since then? - You know what, as a matter of fact, I have. Last week, I saw Renee, she gave me a hug. - What kinda hug? - Whaddya mean what kinda hug? - On the hug scale, what type? - It was a hug, K. - What, you mean I never explained this to you? (sighs) There's basically five types of hugs. Type one, basically the grandma hug. Pretty much arms only. Type two, the closer upper body hug, which generally involves some boob friction. Type three, the classic boob-squisher. It's important that you don't confuse type three with type four, since in type three there is some boob squishing, but there is no crotch friction. - Crotch friction? - Type four adds the crotch friction. Type five is sorta different. Uh, it's pretty much just only done in the summer months or by swimming pools since it involves flesh actually pressing against flesh. - So what about type six? - Oh, there's no type six. - No type six, why not? - 'Cause after type five, you're not huggin' anymore. - I gotta go, K. - It was a two, wasn't it? - Goodbye, K. - Never settle for a two, always go at least a three. God, you'd think by now he would've learned something from me. (man chuckling) (lively rock music) Oh, it's you. Yeah, I suppose we can do this now. You got the money? All right, let's have it.

Seven hours on the road. I mean, I like driving and all, oh!

Mik told me a lot about you, and you louse! - What's the problem? - Is this any way to treat an attractive young girl? - What? - I'm sorry, I have to apologize for my friend here. He's obviously involved in something. Your idea of entertaining this lass is to make her sit here and watch your paint dry?

Trust me, the last thing you want is for Mik to cook for you. - Sure, okay. - Jeeter, you can take off now. - Bye, Jeeter. - Tell Mik we'll be back later.

Then you mean to say you have no refreshments around here? - Oh, refreshments? - Yeah. - Sure, I usually keep something around here for these occasions. Ah, here we go. - What is this? - America's favorite chocolate drink. - Oh, blimey. It'll do. (midtempo rock music) Meh. - Okay, now, with your grand opening, you're going to need publicity materials. Posters, flyers, bumper stickers, that sort of thing. - Oh yeah, that's right. You're the promotions bloke. - Yes, now. Here's an example of some of the work we've done recently. Look at the artwork and the drawings. Everything is done in-house. That way, you save money, and you save time. This is one of my personal favorites. We did all of the work for the opening of a new car wash. Pretty good, huh? - No, not really. - Whaddya mean? - I mean it sucks. I can't use shit like that. - Okay, it's not quite your taste. - No, I didn't say that. I said it sucks. Look mate, I'm opening a punk club here, I'm not opening a bloody car wash or a bleedin' balloon factory. I need something that's in-your-face, you follow? - In your face. - [Harvey] Yeah, you know, something to reinforce the whole punk image. You know, mate, anarchy, fuck the world, right? It's all image. - Oh, well, you know your business, but this is a small town. Something like that might, well, frighten people away. - Precisely. Look mate, everywhere you go, you're gonna find kids tryin' to piss of their moms and dads by spending their money on shit they hate. Besides, if I gave a bloody fuck about what anybody thought, I'd be sittin' where you are. Now look, the whole punk thing is about anger, and that's what I want from you, you follow? - Anger, hm. Well, I'll get my artist right on it. Now that you've provided the direction-- - Are you deaf? How could the same bloke that draws smiley faces on freshly-washed cars deliver anger? - Well, he's really good. - No, no, mate, it's gotta be real. - It's gotta be somebody who's, who's-- - Who's what? - Well, not some bloody purple-suit-wearin' office guppy, that's for damn sure. (punk rock music) - Well, wait, are we done? I still have some great stuff that I'd like to-- - Look when you come up with something I can use, call me. I got another appointment. Cheerio. - Ah yes, bye Harv. - Harvey. Listen, don't waste my time unless you can find someone who can give me what I want. (uptempo rock music) - [Bill] Yeah, Bernice? Get that rat account of mine on the phone. I can't make heads or tails of this shit. I don't know, just get him down here, that's what I pay him for. (phone clicks) (Mik knocks) - Bill? Good, you're in a good mood. - What the hell do you want? - Remember, I asked you about taking Thursdays off? Well, I figured you would need some coverage help, and I have a friend who can take care of my shift-- - Who said anything about you getting Thursdays off? - I talked to you about it a few weeks ago, and you said you would think about it. - What's this about, boy? You flippin' pancakes for somebody else on the side? - No, no, nothing at all like that. There's this class I wanna take at the community college. I have to register within the week, so I-- - Class, you mean like school? - Well, yeah, it's a government class-- - (laughs) Government, ha! - Well, yeah, and I-- - Oh no, you don't need to go to school. Old Billy can teach you everything you need to know about the government. Look at here. You see this big ass pile of papers? Let's say that this is all the money that old Billy here slaves to make each and every day. What does the government do? They take it, all of it! Federal tax, state tax, city tax, licensing fee. And what is Bill left with? He's left with this. Did you ever try to feed a family of six with this? - No. - Now, if I let you have Thursdays off and hire your loser friend, what am I left with? This. Look at this shit. You can't even write on this, much less use if for food. - All right, maybe I'll just go finish up. - Yeah, you go back there and see Walter before you leave. He may have somethin' for you later. ♪ Come on ♪ - Kids suck. (door rattling) (somber rock music) (keys jingling) - [Jerzey] So, am I gonna hear you beg now? - Jerzey, what have you just done? - I just called my father and told him that I was having trouble with certain tenants. He said that I'm in charge, and I can do what I see fit. - Did you tell him it was me? - [Jerzey] What's the difference? You, him, her? - The difference is your dad and I have an understanding. - And in my dad's absence, I can do as I see fit. I'm his legal agent in charge, and I see fit to kick your ass out. (door rattling) - All right, all right, all right, look Jerzey, just please let me in, all right? My shit's up there. - Oh! - Just open the fuckin' door. - Oh-ho, hang on. Foul language is an act of belligerence, and belligerence, as you know, is grounds for expulsion from the premises. - Jerzey, all right, just please, you can't do this, all right? Where's your dad? - Duh, I think I'm the one in charge. I'm calling the shots, I mean, what are you fuckin' stupid or something? (phone rings) Hello? Wonderful, perfect timing. Okay, I'll be right down. I have to go downstairs for a second. I have a real tenant ready to pay real rent in an apartment that just became available.

And what the bloody fuck is all that shit? - Did you know that during the Civil War, this house was a whorehouse where Abraham Lincoln actually bagged like five women, and not only did he bag 'em, but he like killed three of 'em. He was like huge, man. I can tell you're not from around here, but you must've heard the legend. - Blimey! - Oh, I can get a janitor to clean this stuff up.

In my office. Sure, but you don't need references. You've got an honest face-- - Cheerio. - Uh, there is still a small matter of a security deposit. - I'm not taking the bloody apartment, okay?

Maybe you got a sister or something. - What the hell are you? - You must be Mik's cousin. - Second cousin. - Told me you'd be staying here for a few days. Good tenant, that Mik. Actually, I'm looking for a loser friend of his. Name's Jeeter, he's kinda tall and dorky lookin'. Probably carryin' a few milk crates. - He's not here. - Yeah, well I know he wouldn't be stayin' here. Mik and I already discussed that. But I thought he might be here hiding out. - Uh, what do you want with him? - He's a former tenant of the building. I got word he might be on the premises illegally, possibly to terrorize the building. - (chuckles) To terrorize the building? - Look, I noticed you just got in, and if I could just get in there for a little while, you know, just check around, you know, it'd be for your own protection. - I'll tell you what, I'll take a quick look around and I'll get back to you. - It's just that I'm a trained professional.

(bottle clinks) - Oh! (Gwen laughs) You suck. That was my only beer. - Hey! - Being this obnoxious takes energy. I thought you said you were tired. - Of your friend, yes. - So how was your date with K? - It was not a date. He's harmless, he's just looking for something to brag to his friends about. - Someone here sounds awfully full of herself. - Well, you know what I mean. You have lovely eyes, can I cook you breakfast? - K said you have lovely eyes? - [Gwen] Yeah, I think he did. - I haven't noticed. (Gwen laughs) - Your girlfriend is a lucky gal. - Girlfriend? Nah. - Big surprise there. - Hey. Most women want two things from a guy, time and money. I got very little of both. (gentle instrumental music) It's been my experience. - You think all women are like that? - I don't know. Look, I should probably be getting back, you know? - Your beer's leaking. (uptempo rock music) You know, you'd think with all that's happened to you, you'd carry a tent in here. - You're funny. - Let's see, I remember a story that Mik told me, something about a fire escape in the middle of the night. - It was not in the middle of the night. It was in the middle of the night. (Gwen laughs) All right, I was living in New York, and I just left art school, and I ran outta money, but I was painting a lot, you know, I was doing some really good work-- - Yada, yada, yada, the fire escape. - So I get tipped off that my landlord is coming up to my apartment with the marshal, so I look around, and the fire escape is my only way to get out. - So how did you end up here? - I call up Mik, he wires me 20 bucks, and says that if I come back here, he'll give me a place to crash. - Until the heat was off. - Shut up. (Gwen giggles) You know what, Mik was really cool about it. I mean, you know, for a while anyway. - Yeah, well, that's just how he is sometimes. Trust me, I know. Oh, cool, where did you get this? - I found it in a garage sale. - [Gwen] This is great. - So Mik gave you a hard time too, huh? - Oh yeah. Well, when I was about 18, I had gotten accepted at this school down in Texas. - Mm-hm. - Only I had no idea whether I wanted to go to college or not. You know, the old should I go, should I not go, what the hell am I gonna do with my life? I mean, I liked business a lot, I just wasn't sure, and I tried to confide in Mik about it, and he just went on and on about how I'm being irresponsible and I'm ruining my life. He was a real pain in the ass for a while. To be honest, part of the reason why I went to college was just to get him off my back. I don't know. I guess it was all for the best, but still, I don't know about him sometimes. I mean, if he's so damned concerned about me, then how come he, what? - Nothing. - What, am I doing something wrong. - No. - Do you want me to stop playin' with it? - No, you can do whatever you want. - So when did you start it? - Well, I actually started painting yesterday. I mean, but I've been sketching it out for a few weeks. I work better when I sketch it out first. - Brash, yet organized. It's interesting. I'm amazed at how all these colors are coming together to create something. - So you like it? - I'm starting to see something in it. - Like what? - I don't know, anger, sensitivity, passion. - [Mik] Gwen? - Mik, hi. - Hi, great to finally see you again. I wasn't expecting you though for a few weeks. - Oh, well, there's been a slight change of plans. - Oh, I hope you're not just being your old impulsive self. You had a pretty good job, Gwen, and with your business background, I'm sure you could've. - Mik, watch out for the milk crates. - What's going on here? - Oh nothing, Jeeter and I were just getting acquainted. - Whaddya mean, acquainted? What is all this stuff? - Oh, that slimy guy locked him out of his apartment. - Locked out? - Mik, Jerzey's just fuckin' with me, man. - [Mik] I told you this was gonna happen again. - Mik, it's just Jerzey bein' a dick, okay? - So, what are you gonna do in the meantime? - Well, why can't he just stay-- - Just, don't worry about me, okay? I'll figure something out. - Damn it, I knew it, you cannot stay here. - Why? - Did I say anything about staying here? - This is bullshit, he's 29 years, you are 29 years old. What is wrong with you? - All right, first of all, Mik, it's a mistake. - A mistake? - Okay. - Are you or are you not late with your rent? - A little bit, yeah. - And you're gonna stand here and tell me that it's not your fault. - Mik, what I'm saying is, you know-- - A mistake, this is typical. - Mik, you know my landlord and I have an understanding. - Mik, it's not like you're gonna kick him out into the street. Oh, come on, you have the room here, and it's only for a few days. - A few days, yeah right. That's what he said the first time. In some ways, he's still living here. - [Gwen] It's very temporary. - Look, I don't have time for this right now. I gotta go. - Where are you going, you just got here? - A new cook's starting tonight, and I volunteered to help train him. I won't be gone the whole shift, just a few hours, if that. This just better be straightened out by tomorrow. - [Gwen] It'll be straightened out. - Look, when I get back later, you and I will go out for dinner. - Okay. - We'll talk then. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. - Yeah. - Yeah. (punk rock music) (gentle electronic music) (balls clacking) (phone ringing) - Hello? Oh, Harvey, how you doin'? Yes, I got your fax, and we're right on it. Oh yeah, it's goin' great. Oh sure, I've got some stuff to show ya. Yeah, tomorrow, late afternoon, oh, that's still fine. Yes, yes. Okay, see ya then. Oh, shit. - What's wrong, I'm gone for a few hours and the whole place falls apart? - Oh, it's this Harvey. I've been at this all day, but so far, I've come up with nothing. - Was that him on the phone? - He wants, oh hell, I don't even know what this guy wants anymore. - Well, is he comin' here? - Hey, wait a minute. I thought you had a family thing. You were supposed to be meeting with a cousin or something like that. - Oh yeah, yeah, that didn't last as long as I'd hoped, and I thought you might need me. - I do, here. Take a look at what he faxed us over. He said that this was the type of thing he was looking for. - Where'd he get this? - Oh, it doesn't matter. - Looks familiar. - We've just got, what did you say? - Nothin', um. Do you have his number? I thought I might give him a buzz. - I was just on the phone with him. - Yeah, but you know how guys like this are, they need to be stroked. Come on, I'm great with clients, you know that. Lemme take a shot at him. - Why not? I've tried everything. Take him someplace nice, a country club, maybe. Shove a few pints down his throat, loosen him up a bit, you know? - And if you go, let me know because I would like to be there. - Absolutely, absolutely. - And we really have to sell 'em on the company. I don't think he's too impressed with us yet. - Don't worry, he'll be impressed. I can use your phone, right? - Oh, sure, and, uh. If you go, you'll let me know? - Absolutely. You got it. (midtempo rock music) (sighs) Shit. (phone ringing) Hey Gwen, it's K. I need to talk to you about that pass. Gwen, damn it, answering machines suck. (slinky rattles) - I told you the apartment was slanted. - Okay, so I owe you a beer. So I'm leaving tomorrow. - I know. - Am I gonna like New York? - As long as you stay out of the middle. - What is that supposed to mean? - Well, in New York, there are three types of people. People with a lot of money who can spend it, and you know, that's great. - Mm-hm. - You have people with no money, but they got a lot of time, and that's great, too. But see, the problem is that most people are in the middle. - What is the middle? - Nowhere. - Do you miss it? - I'd go back in the right situation. - Why don't you? - No money, no time. - Well, I think I will like it. - Why are you going, anyway? - Well, you're in a place, and the littlest thing happens and you realize that you're going nowhere, so you move on. - Good for you. - I thought you would understand. - Yeah, well. I've always figured you just gotta follow your instincts, you know? - Mm-hm. - I mean, you just gotta do your thing, and whatever happens, happens. - Yep. - I mean, you gotta trust yourself. - Definitely trust yourself. - And keep moving along. - Keep movin' along. - And take control. - Take control.

Can't you tell he's never gonna be a thing? He's just a lazy bastard. - He's not a bastard, Mik. - You know, you're right. He's not a bastard. You're a rat bastard. A selfish, spineless, rat bastard.

You don't know anything about me. - I know you don't do shit. - No, I just don't do what you do. - I'm not like you, Mik. I don't wanna be like you, and you could never handle that, could you? - You see that plaque there? - [Jeeter] What, employee of the month? - Damn right, you know what it means? - [Jeeter] What? - It means that I take things seriously. It means that I've taken responsibility for myself and am conscientious enough to work hard at a job-- - At a job you hate. Is that your idea of being responsible? Slaving away for an abusive boss and wearing it like a fucking badge. That's responsible? Well, I don't want any part of it, then. - Look Jeeter, real people in the real world really work. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Now, you're telling me that you're happy? - We're not talking about me. - Bullshit. What is it that you really want, Mik? I mean, you happy straddling a grill all day? Is that what you really wanna do? And be honest with me for once. - Look, I'm paying my own way, which is more than I can say about you. - Bullshit. I really want to be a painter, that's all I've ever wanted to do. What do you really want? Finish the sentence. I wanna be. I mean, say it, I wanna be a, a what. - Shut the fuck up! - Tell me-- - I wanna be you, Jeeter. Yeah, I wanna wake up every day of my life and sponge off my friends, just lounge around in somebody else's apartment painting all day long. Yeah, that would make me really happy. Let me ask you something. Where has all this happiness gotten you? - Hey guys, what's up? Come on in, Harv. This'll only take a second. Let me introduce you around. This is Mik, Jeeter, and Gwen. - I thought you said we were going drinking. - Really, it'll only take a second, okay? Gwen, hi, I need that pass that I gave you. - Which one of you blokes paints? - He does. - He does. - Mind if I look? - Whatever. - Yep. - Thanks. - Bloody hell, it's the drawing. - What drawing. - Well, the one in the attic-- - My good friend Jeeter here is obviously a very talented artist. We've used some of his work in the past, and I think you'll be-- - This is my drawing. Where'd you get this? - Well, I found it in that attic that that slimy bloke showed me this afternoon, right upstairs, actually. - You're talking about my apartment. - Oh, bloody hell, you live in that shithole? Whew, no wonder you're so angry. - Well, Harvey, so long as you're happy, I think we should have-- - Relax, kid, will ya? All right? This is incredible. - What? - The painting, I mean, it's perfect. This is exactly the kinda stuff I'm looking form - [Mik] You've been looking for that? - Well yeah, I'm opening up a punk club in town in a few weeks-- - And we're gonna use some of Jeeter's artwork in the promotional material. - Jeeter doesn't work for you. - What do you call it? - Well, the company's called Fred's Funhouse, but personally, I've always-- - I'm not talkin' to you, all right? The painting, what do you call it? - I call it Rat Bastard. - (chuckles) Rat Bastard, I like that. It's perfect. - Great, then we can meet with Jeeter in the morning, but in the meantime, we really need to discuss-- - Hold on, the artist isn't affiliated with this gentlemen. He's an independent. I represent him, so if you have any interest in his work, you can just deal with me. - What? - I didn't get your name. - [Gwen] Gwen. - Look Gwen, I like the bloke's work, and I want the man to do some designing for me. I tell you what. I'll give you $200 in advance for the job and another $200 on completion. - I'm sorry, but you obviously don't know who you're dealin' with, here. - You know Harvey, since you've got money, I've got this great idea-- - Oh blimey bollocks, don't you ever shut up? - This gentlemen happens to be a famous artist from New York City. His individual work alone sells for about a thousand to 1,500, but you're talking about a whole design job. - It's a right simple job. Posters, flyers, a few pictures here and there. Not a bad gig for a starving artist if you ask me, eh? Okay, all right, we'll go as high as 750 for the whole project-- - Well, then I guess you're wasting your time and ours. Good luck on finding someone else though. Perhaps this gentlemen can help you. - $1,000, but I can't-- - Hire my artist for $1,000 that's what you can't do. I'm sorry, Harvey, was it? We have several other deals in the works. In fact, we're about to meet with some potential clients right now, so if you'll excuse us. - Do you have any idea what's going on here? - Sorry, I just live here. - Are you fuckin' crazy? - Wait, wait. Now surely love, there's some room in here to negotiate, okay? Okay, let's say $1,000 in advance for the job, and an additional-- - Thousand dollars upon completion. - Oh, blimey. Fine, whatever-- - And-- - Bloody fucking hell. - I retain complete creative control. Look, if you want my art, you gotta have it as is, no changes. - [Harvey] Oh come on, bloke. Surely, you realize-- - It's not negotiable. - Blimey. You are a rat bastard. - Great, I'll drop a simple contract, and I'll have it to you by tomorrow sometime. We'll talk specifics then. - Fine. Am I the only bloke here that needs a drink? - Yeah, I could use one. - Tell that purple-suit-wearin' arse hole boss of yours to lose my number you follow? (sniffs) Is that CKB? - Yes it is. - Wanker. I'll talk to you tomorrow. - Great. - Cheerio. - [Gwen] Cheerio. - So I guess I'm not going to New York tomorrow. - Well, somebody's gotta walk you through this thing. And besides, you owe me a commission. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Well, you owe me a beer. - Okay. (giggles) - Let me see if I understand this. He just left with my client and my girlfriend? - You mean your client and my cousin. - Second cousin. Boy, he is a rat bastard. So, are you gonna go with him? - Yeah, I'm gonna go. - [K] What about work tomorrow morning, you gotta go in early again? - No. Maybe I'll go in later. I've got something else to do in the morning. - Hey, are you guys comin' or not? - Ladies night at The Camel? Damn straight, I'm there. - Jesus. (suspenseful music) (Jerzey laughs) What the hell do you want, grease boy? - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! I am this close to renting out your old apartment. I gotta British guy who's interested. But, to show you I'm a nice guy and because I've got no place to live, I'd be willing to let you stay there on a temporary basis. - [Jeeter] Oh. - For only (sniffs) a hundred more a month. - [Jeeter] A hundred a month, huh? - Hey, it's still less than the Limey's payin'. And just to show you there are no hard feelings, I'll let you slide for a week, baby. (teeth clicks) - Jerzey, that is really kind of you, but, you know what? I don't think that's gonna be necessary. - Why? - [Mik] Because Jeeter's already got a place to live. - Oh, well. Hey, is that hot little cousin gonna be stayin' in town? 'Cause if she is, I can let her have it real cheap. You know, even cheaper than I let Jeeter have it, 'cause you know, Jeeter had all that art stuff there, then it was an artist's loft, and, you know, that's a whole different category. This way, it would be a finished attic. Yes, and a finished attic is a lot cheaper than an artist's loft, you know what I mean? - Hey Jerzey, when did your dad get the new wheels? - What, the Caddy? He got her about week ago. Got a really good deal on it. Daddy? - Yeah, he's outside talkin' to Gwen. - Daddy's home now? - (laughs) Man, does he look pissed. - Oh, shit. (Jeeter laughing) - I'll see you guys outside, there's no way I'm missing this. (midtempo electronic music) - Come on, I'll buy you a beer. How often does that happen? - Never. I'll be right out.
