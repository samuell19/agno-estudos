- Carse, what's in the box marked "Lady Things"? - Oh, that's the stereo. You can't mark it stereo, or else somebody might steal it. - Oh, so it's lady things. - Yeah. - Ah, and in the box marked "Long Boring Books"? - That's the TV. - Thank you. - Do you think if we just keep sitting here, they won't be able to move us and you guys will have to stay here in Chicago? - Hey, come on. I wanted our last day together to be fun. Now it can't be fun if you start crying every five minutes. Fun, got it? - Okay, got it. - I guess this is it. - Promise to e-mail me every day, okay? - I promise. - I know it's gonna be hard to leave this place. Beach can't be that bad, huh? You and Peter always have fun, right? - Yeah. - Hey, want to do something special to say good-bye? How about a little trip to the hoo-ha-hee? - Oh, come on, Mom! That was when I was little. I'm too old for the hoo-ha-hee. - Oh, you are never too old for the hoo-ha-hee. Let's go! - Wait, wait, wait. Okay, ready? - Ready. - All right, let's go! - Hoo. Ha. Hee. - I said, - Hoo-ha. - Ha. I said. - Hee. Hoo-ha-hee! - Wait, wait. I want to see if this guy will take our picture, okay? - Okay. - Hi. Could you take our photograph? - Sure, yeah. - So you'll stay with Peter and Margaret for the weekend. - Yeah, I know the plan. So if Peter's my ex-step-father and I call him by his first name, does that mean I get to call you, "Susan?" - No way. You can call me, "Mom." Or you can call me, "Oh, great and "powerful Mom." - I got it. - Boy, in the morning, cold Chicago. By afternoon, sunny L.A. It's like magic. - It's called a plane, Mom, duh. - Duh. So, you'll stay with Peter and Margaret - Hey, Carson! - just until the furniture comes on Tuesday? Yeah? And you're sure you'd rather do that than... Guess I have my answer. Okay. - Oh, did you have a good trip? - Yeah! - Hey, good to see you. Hi. - Good to see you. - I'll go get my bags. - Oh, hey! Margaret. - Hi! - Hi. - You look great. - Thanks. Apparently the idea of camping out with her mom didn't exactly hit the spot. - Hey, I finally got the new Mortal Kombat. - Cool! - Ah, well, let the spoiling begin. - Zachary! - Hey, baby! - Right here. - Oh, my goddess. - Oh, she's not your type, Mikey. She looks like she might actually have a brain in her head. - This calls for the Yvonne special. - What? - It's, "Is your name Yvonne?" - And that works for ya? - Totally. And they go, "No, it's Fritsy," or whatever, and I go, "Wow, you know, you look like someone I knew "named Yvonne, but you're much, much prettier." - You're scary. - So what... - Well... - Listen, I... I think that busboy's checking you out. - The words every woman wants to hear. - I'm gonna get some menus. - Hi. - Hi. - Enjoying the ambiance. - Oh, it's lovely. - Is your name Yvonne? - Yeah. - Well, bec-... Oh, okay. - There you go. - Thanks, honey. - How'd it go for you, Pal? - She called him "Honey". - Oh. - Michael! Michael! - Mr. Gold, Sir. You are incredible. First thing in the morning, 1st of the month. Rent day, it's like Christmas 12 times a year, 13 if you count Christmas. You're gonna be shocked, but we need a couple more days. - You can't be late with it anymore. - It's not me. It's my roommate, shopping channel addicted, and I told her, "Kate, you have enough anatomically-correct dolls." - It's not her. It's you! - What's a couple more days? I'll wash your car. Okay, I'll go out with your daughter. - You will not go out with my daughter. - Okay, I don't go out with your daughter, and you give me two more days. - Two! - I love you man. - Michael. Michael, bussing is your job, not mine. Is everything okay here? - Oh, great. - Oh, Phillipa? - No! - What? - You were gonna ask me for an advance. - God, you're beautiful when you say that. - Forget it. You folks okay here? - Could I have some more... - Thank you. - Hey! I prefer dinner and dancing first. - Did you blame me for not having all the rent? - I cannot tell a lie. No, I did not. - So you found a house! - Zachary found me a great place on the beach. You remember my friend, Zachary. - Oh, Susan, of course. Is he still gay? - No, Mom. Actually, he took that new pill. Yes. - So how are you feeling? - Okay, actually, which just makes it that much harder to believe. - You know, I read about this very interesting new treatment where they boost your antibodies. - Mom, I told you already, I stopped treatment. There's nothing else... - Wait, is that what the doctors are saying? - No, it was my decision. More treatment isn't gonna save me. - Well, says who? I mean, who knows? - I know. I know, and I assure you, I've looked into this. - I only think that you should get another opinion. - I think I'm getting one right now. - Is everything all right? - Oh, sure, I just wanted to hear your little voice. - Margaret made carrot muffins. She took me shopping. - That's fun. - Mom, she made me try on a dress with a collar like when the dog's not supposed to scratch its stitches, and she even braided my hair like hers. We're twins. - I'll see you soon, huh? - I love you, Mom. - I love you, too, sweetie. - Bye. - Hey! Yvonne, isn't it? - It's Susan. - Michael. Look, I'm sorry about before. I never do that. Okay, I do it a lot, but it usually works. So, where you from? - You can tell I don't live here? - I can tell a lot of things. - Like what? - I can tell you haven't been to the beach in a while. - Yeah, well. - I can tell you're a professional. That means a lot to you, but you're tired of something. Maybe your job, maybe your husband? - Hmm, psychic surfer. - Yeah. You know, they say the ocean cures what ails you. Euripides said that. - He a friend of yours? - Yeah, Euripides Jackson. He's a surfer. - Hmm. - Hey, do you like poetry, 'cause there's a reading tomorrow night-- - I'm not... I'm not into dating right now. - Actually, I meant for you to go alone, but if you want me to go, that'd be okay as long as we went as friends. - You did better with the "Is your name Yvonne" line. - You think? - Okay. - What? - I'll go with you. - Really? - Tonight, I'm going to be reading from my new work, The Maiden Me. Paris, 1958. The light, unlike any other as it tumbles into the room onto my bed and lays itself across my lover. I remember the night before, his mouth hot, wet, searching, then the plunging passion of his kiss, pulsing with raging excitement. Oh, I am a horny volcano! - I love it. I have never heard a 77-year-old woman or any woman, for that matter, refer to herself as a horny volcano. - The fact that she rhymed it with something is what I found most impressive. - Oh! Yeah. So, Michael. What do you do? - What do I do? I surf. I work here. I read. - Did you go to college? What? - You like everything figured out, don't you? Yes, I went to college. - Mm-hmm. - I even did a year of business school at Stanford. - What happened? - What do you mean, what happened? I quit. I quit, and I work here. What about you? - I'm an attorney, or I was. I was a partner at a big firm in Chicago. Big firm. Isn't that the name of the poem we heard tonight? - So what do you do now? - Nothing. - And how do you like it? - Takes some getting used to. So what brought you back to the ocean? - Oh, ah... It's a long story. Yes, so, ah! Isn't the ocean just great? - God, you're beautiful. I, I'm sorry. Was that wrong? - Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson. - Shut up. - Look, is this right, because... Are they supposed to be this close together? You know, how do people find gardening relaxing? How do they take it easy? - Don't ask me. I think stress is a major food group. - Oh, well, my parents are coming over. - Do I still have time to get out over the back fence? - Oh, you got a lot of light. That's good. You're gonna need to get some drapes, though, some sheer drapes. - This is really nice. - Isn't it? - Yeah. - Look, you've got room for a garden here. I could help you with that. - Well, I actually am trying to grow some roses. - Oh, honey, you'll never get them to bloom out here. There's too much salt in the air. - So Mom, Dad, there's something we need to talk about. I was gonna bring it up the other day. I was thinking, when the time comes, whenever, that Peter would take care of Carson. - Why? - Well, he was her step-father for five years and he's very good with her. - Look, I don't know what to say. I mean, what do you expect me to say? - I don't know. I hadn't thought about your side of the conversation. - Why don't we talk about this some other time? - This is what I decided. - Well, let's just talk about it another time. - Like this is a pleasure for me, the plans-after-I'm-dead conversation. I think it really brings a family together. Look, look. It could be years. - Oh, did the doctor say something? - I don't know. All I know is I feel okay. No one is gonna give me a time frame for when my life is over, not before I've had a chance to get some sheer drapes. - I was kinda surprised when you called. - Me, too. Look, I don't think I want to go to a party. - No, no. It's not just a party. It's a wear-Phillipa's-clothes party. She's the owner of the place I work. My friend is house-sitting. - Uh-huh, so we're going to wear her clothes? That's horrible. - Darlin', so is Phillipa. - Michael, what are you, dumb as well as deaf? Hi, how are you? - That's true. - You're an idiot! Anyone want a beer? I need another drink. - No, no thanks. - I'm good. - No? - Uh-uh, thank you. - Okay, I'm goin'. Good party. - You do look incredibly fetching in that. - Thank you. So do you, Foxy. - You know... - Oops! - We could never kiss in this, because then we'd be two Phillipas kissing, and that would be wrong. It would like rain for 40 days and nights. - Let's try. - Oh, wow. - When I was young, I always used to come down to the ocean no matter what was goin' on at home. - Why'd you leave? - To make it, to make something of myself. - And did you? - In a way, but I realize now it was all bull. But, oh well. There you go. - So now you have another chance for it not to be bull. - Yeah. I'm not into anything serious. - We've established that. - Hey. - Hey, I got some muffins. - I see. And you cut them. A lot. - Some coffee? - Sure. - You know, last night was really nice. Really, but I can't do it. - What do you think I want from you? - I don't know. Milk? - Sure. I have to pick my daughter up today, and I really need to spend some time with her. - You think I can get some coffee with my milk? - Yes. - Look, you know. I'll just get my coffee on my way home. I'll see ya. - Okay. - Okay. - Hello? - Peter. - - Susan. - Hi, yeah, it's me. Is Carson there? - Yeah, she's right here. - Hey, Mom. - Hey, Honey. So, I'm comin' to get ya. Is there anything you need? - No, thanks. Are you okay? - Mmm, yeah. I'm feeling fine. I'll see you soon. - Okay. - Can't wait. - Me, too. Bye. - Mom! - Honey! Baby! Oh, God, I missed you! - Mom. - Oh, I know, how embarrassing. So, you have a good time? Yeah? You ready to go? - Let me go get my stuff. - Okay. - So how's it being back home? - It's okay, good. - Yeah? - Yeah. You look good. - Thanks. Hey, I like Margaret. - Well, you know, Maggie and I are planning on getting married. - That's good, isn't it? - Yeah, it's good. It's just that Carson has been acting out a lot with us. - She was? Oh, Peter, why didn't you tell me? I could've talked to her. Oh, God, I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's okay. I'm telling you now. It's just I don't... I don't think that what we talked about before is the right plan. - Oh, yeah, b-... - There's just been so many changes since we first talked about this. Your parents are great people. - Okay, okay, okay. Now I remember why we got divorced. - Why you have to go there? - Because if I don't make a joke right now, I just might hate you. Carson, we're outta here! Wanna go out and paint the town? - Paint the town? - Yeah, I know. What does that mean? It sounds like a lot of hard work. You know, sweetie, I talked to Peter. - Yeah, I know. - I heard them talking back at Peter's house. - You know, Carson, it's not about you. - By the time I'm gonna live with someone, I'll be graduated from high school and I can get my own apartment. - Carson, you all right? - Yeah. - Hi, I'm Michael, a friend of your mother's. - Mom, your friend is here! - Hi. - Hi. I wasn't anywhere near the neighborhood, and I thought I'd... Look, I came to ask you both out. I had fun the other night, and it doesn't have to be a big deal. I knew your daughter was coming, and I thought I could take you both and show you the town. - Well, I grew up here. - I can show you another town. Is that a yes or... - So I think this will be fun. We don't have to go if you don't want to. - So what's the deal with you and this guy anyway? - No deal. Michael's just a friend. - Does he know about you? - No. - Are you gonna tell him? - Probably not today. Hey, I can't believe we have been here this long and we haven't gone to Venice Ice Cream yet. They make their own ice cream. It's incredible. I used to live there when I was a little girl. - Mom, this isn't an olden days story, is it? - Oh, yeah, yeah. The olden days before there were CDs and fax machines. Those were the days. Come on! So, Michael, this is Carson. Carson, this is Michael. Wait, I forgot my purse. - So, Carson, how old would you be? - Eleven. - Eleven, wow! That's a good age. - Why? - I have no idea. It's just... Hey, you know what? I... I brought you some of my old comics. I thought you might like these. - You don't have to be nice to me, you know? - Well, that's a relief. - I'm used to it with my mom's boyfriends. - They buy me giant lollipops and crap to get me to like them so she likes them. - Well, what if I want you to like me whether or not your mom likes me? - What if I don't want you to? - So, Carson starts school tomorrow. - Yeah? You seem pretty excited about that. - You can tell? - And I start taking some new classes, one in Art History and one in Art Appreciation. - Appreciation? - I'm not that happy with that one. - If you don't like it, drop it. It's simple. - Pretty radical, Mom. - So, Carson... - Don't bother. - Okay. So Carson, oops! Right! I forgot, but it was good, but never mind. - Mom! I'm home! - Hey, Honey, how was school? - The only girl who talked to me also talked to herself. - Ah, see, I always told you you were special. You're the most interesting person other than her. Da! - Mom. - I made those. - This is a little weird. I mean, you were never home when I came home from school. - I know, I know, and I feel bad about that. - Actually, I kind of liked it that way. - Oh, ha, ha, ha. You did, did you? - These are really good. Not! - Oh, you know they are. - You can't catch me. - This is war! - Hey. - Hey. - I thought maybe I could buy your affections. - You wanna give me a bike? - You kidding? I rebuilt this puppy from scratch. I'll let you ride it, but I'm not givin' it to you. - Okay, let's go. Race ya! - Hey, Carson! - You can't catch me! - Come on back! Carson! The hell were you thinking? Hey, what the hell were you thinking? - It was a million miles away! - Don't give me that. That was stupid! - Fine. I'm goin' home. - Carson, I'm sorry. Carson. Hey, I'm sorry. Look, I over-reacted, I know, and I'm sorry. - You snapped. What is that about? - Look, people get hurt that way. - Well, I didn't. Are you blind? - Well, people do. - Right. I'm walking home alone. - Carson? Look, would you stop, please? Please, Carson. - Four years ago my sister was hit by a car when she was riding her bike. It was night and she was killed. It wasn't the driver's fault. He didn't see her. So that's it. I did snap, but I'm sorry. - How old was your sister? - Twenty. Two years younger than me. - Did you really love her? - She was my best friend. I know that sounds stupid. - That doesn't sound stupid. - I remember one Christmas when we were both kids. I really wanted this boomerang. You know, you throw it out, and it comes back to you. My parents said, "No," that it would hurt someone. Still, Christmas morning came, and I kept expecting to see that boomerang. I got an encyclopedia and football. No boomerang. And then later my sister calls me into her room, and right there, right underneath her Dukes of Hazzard poster, she hands me this present wrapped like a boomerang. It was. She spent her whole savings on it. First day I threw it, it landed in someone's car, they drove away and I never saw it again. From that moment on, my sister could do no wrong. - You were lucky to have a sister like that. - So, Dr. Carlin recommended you very highly. - She's an excellent oncologist, but she cheats at poker. The things you learn about your college roommate that you never wanted to know. I see you've had a lot of treatment. - Chemo, radiation, crystals. I've done it all, but it made me really sick. - Chemo is rough. - I meant the crystals. I'm not much of a believer. - So tell me, how are you feeling? - Fine, really, with some headaches, a little lower back pain but no big deal. - Well, really the only thing to do is to monitor you to help keep you as comfortable as possible. Is there anything you need right now? - A new body would be nice but other than that, no. - I'm gonna spend the night at Emma's tonight. - No, you're not. - Why not? - Well, first of all, it is a school night, and second of all, we are going out to dinner. - Doesn't what I want count? - Oh, honey, of course it does, but what I want usually wins. - Why are you doing that? - It is the right of the mother, the because-I-said-so rule. - No, I mean why are you putting make-up on? - Well, because it would be too expensive to hire someone to do it for me. - Does it make you feel better? - No, but I look like I feel better. Anyway, go get dressed. We're goin' to dinner. - Fine. I'm goin' to Emma's tonight. - No, you are not. Now, come on. We're going to dinner. You can go to Emma's tomorrow night. Carson, you know, you're so, so... - So much like you, huh, Mom? - Hey, Susan. - You've got to be joking. Oh! - Does it look like me a little bit? In the eyes, you can see-- - Get it out of here. It's awful. It's awful! Oh my, I hate it! - All right. I'm done with it. - Alice Walker. Hey, hey, this one has my favorite poem in it. Wow. "I have learned not to worry about love "but to honor its coming with all my heart, "to know the rush of feelings, "swift and flowing as water. "The source appears to be "some inexhaustible spring "within our twin and triple selves. "A new face I turn up to you. "No one else has ever seen." - Where's Carson? - She's spending the night over at her friend's house. - Great, so we're... It's just the two of us. - I can invite some people over. My parents are free. - No. No. That's okay. - Uh-Huh. - Something wrong? - You're different than how I thought you were. You have depth. - Well, gee, thanks. - It's not a compliment. Michael, I'm not well. - What do you mean? - I mean I have cancer. - Is it bad? - No, it's the good kind. Dang. Yeah, it's bad. I knew something was wrong, but I just... I just was too scared to get it checked. - So are you doing treatment? - I did, but it didn't touch it. - Are you telling me that you're dying? - I'm telling you I have cancer. - Why didn't you tell me before? - I didn't know you'd matter so much. - Mom, I'm home. - Here, right here. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. So you wanna do something? You wanna be seen at the movies with your mom? - Did you go to the doctor? - I'm gonna go tomorrow. - I thought your appointment was today. - I changed it. - Where's Michael? - I'm not seeing him anymore. I miss him. - How long will you be gone for? - I don't know. Don't worry about the rent. I'll send you some money. - Why you doin' this, Mikey? - I gotta get my life together, Kate. I can't keep livin' like this. - Look, you can do whatever you want. Just quit pretending this is about getting your life together. Hey, come here. - Going somewhere? - Yeah. Actually, I'm going away for a little while. - Thanks for saying good-bye. - I was going to. - Liar. I thought you might want these back. - Actually, I wanted you to keep them. Look, the only reason I came by was to tell you that I think my mom misses you. She told you, didn't she? - Yeah. - I thought you liked her. - I do. I just... It's just not as simple as that. - Why not? - I don't know. - If you knew your sister was gonna die, would she still have been your best friend? - Just... Please, keep these. - Look, I don't care if you guys get back together or not, but I saw how much she liked you, and you seemed to have fun. If I can do it, you can do it. - Hey. - What are you doing here? - Amway? - Look, I got somewhere to go. - Where? - Well, to the supermarket, if you must know. - Well, yeah, I know how they are if you're late. Look, Susan. I'm sorry I walked out. I shouldn't have done that, but I did need some time to think. - That's fine. You take all the time in the world. - Come on. Can we not fight? I mean, because we haven't fought yet, and I don't want it to be over some little thing like you've got cancer and I walked out on you. Thank God you found that funny, because that could have gone either way. So you should give me another chance. Come on. We can be friends, whatever you want. - I don't... I don't think I can just be your friend. - Thank god you said that, too. - So you divide that by that? - Right. - Oh, okay. - This is fun. I should do math more often. - You could do the rest of the answers since you're so good at it. - okay. - Hey, you guys ready to go? - Yup. This is gonna be great. - I don't think so. - What? - Just wait. - What? - So Mike. What do you do? - Well, Sir. I am currently working as a waiter, but I'm close to getting my degree in business. - What's keeping you? - Well... - He really makes more money as a stripper. - Your daughter's very funny. I don't strip. - Oh, good. - Burgers are ready, Marnie. - Marnie? That's new. - Yeah. - Not amusing. - Hey. - Hey. This is a picture of my mom when she was around my age. I guess this is gonna be my room one day. My grandparents are gonna take care of me when my mom is gone. Lucky me. Peter, my old step-father, he said he didn't wanna take care of me. It's okay. I didn't wanna live there anyway. - He doesn't know what he's missin'. - Yes, he does. It's okay. Did my mom tell you about my real father? - A little. - I'm sure she did. She tells everyone what an idiot he is. Guess that makes me half idiot. - She couldn't have always thought that. Carson, come here. You know something? It's all right if it's not okay. - I know. - Trade ya. - Sure. - Okay. - Is he looking? - He's looking. Look! - No. - Look! - No! - You missed it. - Oh well. - - What's goin' on? - Carson! - Who is he? - My mom's boyfriend, come on. - Wow! - Is Mom okay? - Oh, she's fine. She was just taking a nap. I didn't want to wake her up. - Michael, this is my friend, Emma. - Hi. - Emma? Let's go! - Darn, it's my mom. See you later. Bye! - Bye! There's this guy in my class. - Yeah? - And he's pretty cute, and I think he likes me. - Uh-huh. - Well, anyway, he's really cool, but every time he's near me, he acts all goofy and stupid. - That's a good sign. The women of your clan have that effect. - Yeah, well... Michael, were you mad at your sister for dying? - Yes. - Oh, good, good. Carson's been wanting these. They have to be a specific make or they're just not cool. - Does she always have to dress like that? I mean, she looks like a gang member. Carson is a very pretty girl. What about this? - Try it. - Honey? - Oh, God. Okay, seriously. - Sorry. Here you go, sweetie. - All right! Sometimes they're a little baggy for me, too, but she likes them so I keep quiet. - Yeah, well, I kept my mouth shut when you went through your new wave phase. You were just like that, very strong-willed. - I guess I come from a long line of strong-willed women, huh? Got my father's eyes and my mother's will. - Well, just be glad your father's eyes are nice. - Hmm... that was funny. - Well dear, I do have my moments. - Ooh, Mommy? - Oh! Darling! darling! - Please, somebody help me! - - Mommy! - Mom, please. - - Darling, don't leave me. - No. - Darling. - - No, Mom. - Somebody call an ambulance! Please! Call an ambulance! - Somebody help! - Darling! - No, Mommy, please! - Susan, judging by the MRI, it looks as if the cancer has spread to your brain. - God. - Carse, who you calling? - Jamie. - Didn't you call her already today? - Oh, so now I can't call her? Mom, stop acting like you can tell me what to do, like everything's normal, 'cause it's not. - Hey, hey, hey, hey hey! What is this all about? - Grandma tells me what to do. You tell me what to do. - Yeah, well, if it's any consolation, Grandma tells me what to do, too. - Why did we have to come here? - You know why. I needed to come home. - Well, it's not my home. You take me out of school and bring me here? And then you're just gonna die and leave me? - Carson, come on. - Leave me here with Grandma and Grandpa, and I hate them! - That's enough. - Is there anything else you could possibly do to ruin my life? - That's enough! - Hi. - Nice of you to show up, finally. - I'm 10 minutes late. So where's Carson? - We had a little fight. She's over at a friend's house. - Yeah, this is hard for her. - She talks to you about it? - A little. She's gotta talk to someone. - Of course it's not me. - Susan. It can't be you. - Look, don't. Don't. Just go. - You wanna push me away? If that'll make you feel better, go ahead. I don't think it will. - How do you know how I feel? How do you know? - I guess we'll be ordering pizza. - When Carson was a baby, I promised her I would be there for her. And her birthday is coming, you know? And how can I not be there for all of her birthdays and when she gets hurt and when her heart is broken? I should be there! Things are not supposed to be like this! - I know. - Oh, God. Whatever I did, I'm so sorry. Please, don't take this away from me. Don't take this away, please. Oh, sweetheart. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's okay. - I love you. - I love you, too. Come here. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. - Mom! - Yeah? - There's clowns at the door. - Oh, no. Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I told Grandma and Grandpa you're too old for clowns. - I've always been too old for clowns. - Okay, go. - My turn. Carson, will you give me a card? Thanks, honey. Okay, here, I have this one. - Oh, just my seven down on your seven. - Carson! - Mom? - Happy birthday, sweetie. - Carsey! - Janie, this is Emma. Emma, this is Janie. - Come on, Carson! You serve. - Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I paid you guys to lose. - I don't think he knows you moved. - Carson? - Oh, no! Oh, what do you mean, "Oh, no?" This is a big day. Come on. How many times in a girl's life does she turn the big one-two? Come on, we'll bury this. We'll make a time capsule. - Dear God. - Come on, we'll bury this. We'll dig it up in 10 years. Okay, what would you say to somebody in 10 years? - I'd say, "Why are you spending your time "digging up video tapes?" - Come on. - I know what you're tryin' to do, and I can't do it. - Hey. Hey, why don't you sit up and get under the covers, okay? - Okay. Oh, this is the most fun relationship you've ever had. - Stop. - Wanna go get a beer, go to a disco or somethin'? This is so weird. Can't tell you how weird this is. - I'll watch it get light. It's great. No wonder so many people are afraid of the dark. It sneaks in the part where it gets light again. I was thinking I would go back to school, get my teaching degree. I think maybe I'd like to teach English. - That's great. You could teach some Jane Eyre meets The Fantastic Four. - Actually, I think Jane Eyre could've used a meeting like that. Pick up her spirits a little. Susan. I love you. And if you were gonna be alive forever, I'd wanna be with you forever. - Better watch it. If a miracle happens, I just might hold you to that. - What would you think about the idea of me taking care of Carson? You know, when... I... - I don't know what I think about... Are you serious? - Absolutely. Okay. You look beautiful. All right, now tell me a secret from your past. I won't tell anyone. - Well, when I was four, I seriously believed I was a mermaid. I did. I did. I would wrap a green towel around my legs and make my parents carry me all around the house. - And did they? - Yeah, they did. They did, which was pretty cool of them. They did have their moments. - Okay, so history of Carson. What was Carson's father's name? - Evan. - Tell me about him. When did you fall in love with him? Okay, when did you like the guy? Come on, for Carson. - Well, we met in college, and he was very sweet, funny. I could always call him and he knew just what to say. I really did love him. And maybe we're just meant to love some people for just a little while. - If you could say anything to Carson on her 16th birthday, what would it be? - I'd say, "I love you, "and even if I were alive, you wouldn't be getting a car." And... And also to know that you have a voice and that that voice matters. - And at 21? - Ah, this is a big one. I'd say that... Okay, Carson, Your head and your heart, they might be choosing different paths right now, but go with your heart's path. You meet the most interesting people. - How about on the day that she's getting married? - Wow, I'd say my little girl has grown up and that I hope... I hope you met somebody wonderful, and I hope... I hope that he loves you. You deserve to be loved and that... And you deserve to be loved and honored and cherished and that, God, if you change your last name, I hope it doesn't rhyme. - What about when she has her first baby? - Your baby is the most precious thing in the world, isn't it? While your life will never be the same, you can't imagine any other way. Carson, I know we've had our fights, and I know there have been times we've been really made at each other, but that's okay, and I don't want you to feel guilty about that, and I don't want you to feel that anything was ever left unsaid, because we never had to say anything to know how much we really loved each other. And you should remember that you are never, ever too old for the hoo-ha-hee! I have decided what I want to do and what I think is the best thing for Carson. I want Michael to adopt her. - Are you crazy? What are you talking about? - Mom, this can't be what you want at your age, to raise another child. - I want what is right, and what is right is that we raise her. - What is right is that I raise her. What is right is that I don't leave in the first place. - Do you think I don't know that? - You know, it really seems like what we all want is what's best for Carson. - You're not family. Stay out of this. - Dad, dad. If I were to stay alive, Michael and I would marry, and he would adopt her anyway. - Well, don't expect us to support this decision, Susan. - Look, this is the hardest decision of my life. Now do you think I would make it frivolously or out of spite? I wouldn't, and I would ask that you would support me even if it's too much to ask. - We will fight it. - Well, you can't. It's my decision to make while I am still alive. I can't, I can't, I just can't believe it. - Well, what will he do about money? - Oh, great Phil, great. - Mr. Morton, Mrs. Morton, I'm not trying to take Carson away from you. You're her family, and she's gonna need her family. She's gonna need all of us. We all want what's best for Carson for who she is, not for who she reminds us of. - I don't know why you're doing this to us. - I know. Mom, why are you making this about you? - Well, isn't it? - I am not trying to punish you. - Susan, please listen to me. You are making a mistake. - No, no, no. No, no. You know what? I don't have time to try to please you anymore. I've gotta think about what's best for Carson. Oh, God! God! Are you... Are you ever gonna give me a break, huh? Are you ever gonna see me for who I am? - Why do you get into all of this? - Because, because I must. Because, Mom, my whole life has been about how pretty I looked, how well I did in school, how many ribbons I brought home and what color they were. - How does this matter anymore? - Mom, it does. Don't you see? I am leaving with me. All I have left is me, only me. - Yeah. - And I hate that that doesn't feel like enough. - I only wanted the best for you. - And I want what's best for Carson, and I hope... No, I believe. I believe that one day you'll be able to understand that. - Tomorrow it would be a really good idea to move her out of the beach house... - She's in a lot of pain. There's gotta be something we can do. - We can give her the morphine. - She doesn't want it. She doesn't want to feel drugged. - Well, if she doesn't want to take it, there's nothing I can do. - Is she okay? I'm going in there. - Honey, she finally fell asleep. Maybe we should just stay out for a little while, huh? - Excuse me? Who the hell are you? - I'm the nurse. - Carson, come on. - Well, she's not gonna tell me what to do. - It's just what she thought was right. - How would she know? How would you know? Have you been here? She's not just some sick person. She's my Mom. I know her better than you. I know her better than all of you! - Get out of here! Leave me alone. What is wrong with her? Why couldn't she fight it? She could have fought it, you know? - She did. She just couldn't kill it. - Does she hate me that much? - Of course she doesn't. This isn't what she wanted. She never wanted to leave you, never. Sometimes things happen and they don't make any sense, and they hurt us in a way that you think no one will ever understand. - Like she doesn't need me anymore. - She does, Carson. You have to help her. You have to forgive her. You have to forgive yourself for not wanting to forgive her. - What will I do without her? - I don't know. I don't know. - Susan has made her decision that Michael Blake will receive custody of the child, and we've heard from all the parties. As the appointed attorney, I'd like to hear from Carson. Carson, where is it that you'd like to go? - Oh, baby. Oh, it's okay. - The person that I want to take care of me is you. But I know that won't be forever. I know that when you met Michael, they probably thought you were crazy for liking him. I know I thought you were. But I can talk to him, almost like I can talk to you. And I think I'd want him to adopt me, not just because I'd have the coolest-looking dad in my whole class. But because he cares for us. I love Grandma and Grandpa, but I think I want to stay in our house with Michael. - Okay. - Mom? Mom. - You slept a long time. That's good. - Why? - Why what? - Why is that good? Do you love me? - Yes, I do. - Do you? - Of course I do. Of course I love you. - She doesn't want to eat. - How is she? Can I talk to her? Okay, then let her sleep. I'll see you soon. He's so cute, Mom, and he likes me. All the girls in the school like him, and he likes me. - Oh, so he's cute and smart, huh? Mmm... No. Sweetheart, maybe you should go stay with Grandma and Grandpa. - I'm staying here with you. - Carson, don't hate me for leaving you. I don't want to. - I don't hate you, Mommy. - Come here, sweetheart, come on. So many things I want to tell you. Just stay true. Keep your heart open. Know you are such an incredible person. Know that you are enough no matter what. It took me so long to figure that out. I want you to know that now. Okay? Carson, I will always, always love you. And if there's such a thing as angels, I'll always be right there in front of you, protecting you the whole way. Know that. Honey, you can stay with me now, but when the time comes-- - Mommy, no. - When the time comes, I want you to remember this feeling, okay? I wanna leave with my arms around you. You know, when you were born, I looked into your eyes, beautiful wise eyes, and I thought wherever you came from, it must be a beautiful place. - Maybe that's where you're going. - I hope so, my love. I hope so. - Oh, thank you. Michael? Thank you for all you've done. You've been very good to Susan, and I just want you to know that if you need anything at all, we would be glad to help. - Thank you. - Michael. - Right here. - Where's Carson? Is she in the room? - No. She's outside. - Oh, good. - You're so beautiful, so incredibly beautiful. - Carson has something I never had. - She had you as a mother. - Is she close? Promise me that she's not here. - She's looking out at the ocean. It's a beautiful day. It's warm. Susan, it's okay to go. We'll be okay. You're so loved. - Tell me about the day you teach Carson to surf. - Really? Surf? - Surf. - Well, you know Carson. In a year, she'll already have told me that I'm doing it all wrong. She'll show me what's right. - Tell me more, Michael. - Yeah. One day she'll paddle out past the breakers, and we'll be sitting together, waiting in the sun, and then... Then a big one will come. We'll drop in together. She'll be perfect, unafraid, the wind blowing her hair back, and I'll be watching, speechless. The women of your clan have that effect. No. - Could you take this? Hey. - Hey. I had to come outside. Grandma kept wanting me to pass things to people. She says pass them clockwise. Forget it. It's not fair, is it? - No. - I'm gonna miss her for the rest of my life. - I will, too. - What're you lookin' at? - Good Lord! There's a cat in the kitchen licking the butter. - Was it licking it clockwise? - Marcia, would you do something with it? Carson, would you like to come and help pass out the coffee? - I'd love to, Grandma.
