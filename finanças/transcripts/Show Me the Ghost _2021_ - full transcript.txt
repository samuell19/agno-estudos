Subs OCR'd/cleaned by RSG. Thanks to 25tab. Excuse me.. Would you like some water? Or... some eye drops? Oh. What’s happening? Yeji? Hodoo! - Did you drink again? - Hodoo! Look! I failed again! Ah... Again? I hoped maybe this time, but.. And, I totally bombed another interview today. Hey, it's no big deal to fail. It’s no big deal? 4.24 GPA, proficient in English and Chinese, 6 licenses, 3 internships, 5 contest wins! What more do I have to do? Is it a crime to be a graduate of a non-Seoul university? Is it a crime? You’ll get in next time. You will! No, no. I won’t. There’s no way that I will. There’s... There’s.. There's no hope for me. Ye-Yeji! What, what, what? Give me back my money. Mo-money? Fifteen thousand. Weren’t you rich from stocks? You said I can pay back slowly. That was before my stocks got cut brutally to pieces! Pay back now! I put it all in my rent deposit. Deposit? I told you that I was moving. What? Sorry. Fuck.. Fuckin’ 28 years of my life! Did you get some sleep? Do you remember last night? Nice house, right? You know how I always wanted a kitchen. This place is fully furnished! Plus, a brand new fridge! Look at this. Isn't it clean? Isn't it? Total vintage vibes, right? Look at the tiles. Such a retro feel, right? Wow. These setups are rare to find. Just awesome. The bed was here, too. Isn't it great? Ah! This is my new roomie, Charles. -	It’s really strange... - This is why I quickly signed. I did good, right? There’s got to be something. Ah. There is one bad thing. The neighbor’s window. Oh my gosh! Oh, I’m sorry. H-hello. Ah. Yes, hello. You just moved in, right? - Yes. It’s been about a week. - I see... - I guess you're newlyweds. - What? No! Oh, then you're siblings. No wonder you two look alike. Ta-da! Look what I made. Try it! I feel a bit sick. Before, you said that you were hungry. Yeah. I suddenly feel sick. Come on, it's delicious. How long are you going to stare in the mirror? Hey! Does it make sense that you and I look alike? No. We don’t look alike at all. And, I really don't think this makes sense. How can rent be $330 with a $20,000 deposit? The house is a bit old, but it’s in a good location and it’s spacious. Plus, it’s fully furnished. Hey, it's because I made a good bargain, of course! Bargained? You? I’m a Psychology major. So, it was a piece of cake! A piece of cake? First, you have to know the house owner’s psychology. As much as tenants want a home, house owners want tenants, too. Why leave it empty? They still pay loan interests and maintenance fees. Yeah, they do.. After you see through psychology of the house owner, from then on, it's poker face time. You can’t look like a pushover. P-p-p-please reduce. T-t-t-twenty dollars, please. Once I saw through him, he just agreed to it. That’s strange... Still, isn't it too furnished? Like it's missing the person who used to live here. So, this is better. Just think how much we’d make, if we sold it all! By the way, Yeji. When do you plan to leave? Oh, right now? Well, didn't mean right now. Hey, Yeji. Your bag. Yeji, what is it? Are you okay? Hey, do you still play with these things? It’s not mine. Whether it’s yours or not, you should’ve put it away. Are you okay? Ah... that’s my room.. Hey, Kim Yeji! You should get going, now. Oh, did I wake you? Hodoo. Yeah? Whose money was the $15,000 out of the $20,000 deposit? It-it was yours. Then, who has a larger share in the house? Please have a good night sleep. Yeji, what? Why do you keep...? You scared me. What did you dream? Hey! Are you okay? Y-Yeah... I’m hungry. You’re dead if it’s a prank. Turn it on! Now! Oh, come on... I told you not to... prank me? Hodoo, don’t worry. I really didn’t see anything. I saw nothing. It's okay. It’s okay. I saw nothing. Yeah, nothing. Go upstairs, now. I still think it’s strange. Yeji. Aren’t you going home? It’s not that I won’t. I just can’t. Why? I took the rent deposit and blew it all in stocks. What? I know. I'm an idiot. That’s just how it is for me. Then.. How about going to your parents’ place? If you tell my mom, you’re dead. But, still... Wouldn’t it be a bit weird to stay at a single guy’s house? Hodoo. Want to break our 20-year-old friendship? Who lent you money and fed you during your rough times? Yes, please have this, too. Welcome to... On! Hello! Ah, yes, hello. I guess you work here. Yes. Luckily, there was an opening when I moved here. Did you come to buy something? What? Oh! I’m out of ramen. Oh, ramen’s over there. Yes. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Hope to see you next time. - Yes, good bye. What's with him? Why’s he so awkward? Well, if he’s really shy, he could look that way. Shy... This is the best thing about working at a convenience store. They’re all expired. It’s OK. They haven’t gone bad. Later, I’ll cook a proper meal for you. What is it? What is it? - Someone’s in the house. - What? Let’s just call the police. Then, it’ll be too late. Turn the lights on? Charles! Ah, geez... Yeji. What is it? Are you okay? Why does this keep crawling out? Ta-da! What do you think? I definitely saw it. Oh, come on. You always saw things ever since you were little. I definitely heard it. You always heard things, too. And, you always acted silly ever since you were little. Yeah, you’re right. Lock the door properly. Don’t be sorry after you get robbed like last time. All right. All right. Hey! - What’s this sudden smell? - Smell? What smell? Like something rotten. It's not mine. Then.. Ah, it’s not it. Can’t smell it here, either. I think I can smell it around here. There’s nothing. I think I really smell it here. Then, are there ticks or molds in here? Are they? What’s that? - You saw it, too, right? - Yeah! On! Are t-ticks... a bit big? W-where are you going? Hey, hey, hey! Is this real? How did... that get in there? Who is it? Oh, hello. What brings you...? You knew, right? Excuse me? You already knew about that house being weird, right? Something happened to the woman who lived next door, right? I bumped into her few times. She was weird, as if she was possessed by a ghost. Admin Law Lecture That house was weird, too. Like it was possessed by evil spirits. And, after a while.. I still have nightmares. Did I call the police too late? Should I have done something beforehand? It all feels like it’s my fault. I’m sorry for not telling you in advance. It’s all right. I thought it wasn’t appropriate to bring it up. It would’ve been hard for me to tell, as well. Excuse me, but those boxes.. Oh, I’m leaving in a week. Are you moving? Yes. I’m going to the training institute for passing the Admin Exam. Oh, the Public Administration Exam? Wow! It’s no big deal. Initially, I thought it would only take me 2, 3 years. But, I kept failing until I barely passed. All I got left are neck pains and debt. Still, that’s great. You must’ve worked so hard. Thank you. Lucky him, passing the Admin Exam. You know, I could smell that same smell from our house. The rotten smell. Our house... Could he be in danger like us? Something’s off. Off? Now, you think it's off? What? Call right now! - W-Who? - Who do you think? House owner! Please give back the deposit! I mean, really. Huh? How could you rent out while hiding that someone died? What? What is it? Special Terms. The fact that there was a suicide. cannot be the cause for breach of contract. This is really.. Psychology? See through the house owner? You cut $20 from a monthly rent of $350 to get $330? Plus, for 3 years? You could've signed a 1-year lease, but 3 years! 3 years! How could we get such crappy special terms? There’s nothing we can do. Even if the dead is dead, the living should keep living. What could go wrong? We probably saw nothing. Yeah, you're right. We weren’t well-nourished these days. I heard dozens of people commit suicide daily in Korea. - By the dozens. - Yeah, right. I heard most of them hang themselves. Look. Nothing’s here. Yeah, this is a piece of cake. - Have a warm cup of water. - Oh, thank you. - Hot! Hot! - Are you okay? Wait. I’m sorry. It's hot! That's right. We just need new tenants! That's right. Wow. It’s really nice. Wow. It’s fully furnished? These terms are a rare find, so I’m very sad to be moving. - Isn’t it nice? - Yes, it is. You got 1 text message! Oh my. I’m sorry, but someone else texted to come see right now. - Please wait. - Honey. - We’ll sign it. The lease. - Today. Shouldn’t you think it over a bit more carefully.? - No! It feels right, and... - We'll sign now! What was that? Is it an earthquake prone area? Excuse me? Didn’t you just feel something like an earthquake? What earthquake? What do you mean? Oh no! Honey! Honey! Let's get out. Get out! - Honey, wait for me. Hey! - Come quickly. Quick! It’s not an earthquake! It isn’t the earthquake! Your shoes! Honey, wait for me! Ta-da! It has a total vintage vibe, right? And, a total retro feel? These days, anything’s got vintage or retro feel. It’s totally old-fashioned. I'll sign the lease. - What? - What? I said I’ll sign. Yes. Can’t catch my drift? I said that I’ll sign! What do we do? What's this? What’s going on? Wait, please. No, no. Don’t go! Don’t go! - Your shoes! - Don’t go! Why are you suddenly moving during your lease? Oh, my husband changed jobs. It won’t be easy to find a house with these terms. - So, we are worried, too. - I see. Then, I’ll sign right now. - Yes. Let’s go outside to sign. - All right. Oh my! Who...? - Hubby, what’s wrong? - Hubby? Hubby? Hubby! He's not my hubby! He isn’t my hubby! We’re ruined. Hey, what happened? Why is my neck...? If this keeps up, we won’t live long. That’s it! We need an expert! An expert? General Bodhisattva. Exorcist fairy. Il-wol Guru. This is it! Expert exorcist for possessed houses! - Hello? Is this ll-wol Guru? - Yes, this is ll-wol Guru. A ghost is in our house now. It’s really bad. Can you help? - Basic plan’s from $10,000. - Excuse me? - $1,000 more per 35 sq. feet. - I see... What did they say? Why’s it so expensive? We can do it ourselves! Us? Self-exorcism. Wooden sword made of wild peach wood? Evil-spirit-chasing bells. Geez, why’s the equipment so complicated? Chicken blood. Yuck. Hey! Hey! This is it! Red beans and salt! Red beans and salt! Be gone. Be gone. Go away, evil spirits. Go away. So salty. Evil spirits, go away. Please, I pray. Please. I pray for the evil spirits to go away. Please. Go away, evil spirits. Be gone! Over there, too. Yeah, that's right. Harder. Harder. "He told me that I could do...” In the curtain, be gone. - But, will it really work? - Hey! Don’t jinx it! What’s happening? What's this? What’s happening? What's this? Yeji! I’m sorry. I apologize. Get out now! Yeji. I can’t take it anymore. I’m scared. Cheap Exorcists. Special discount event. Handsome flower boy? Oh, the charisma. He looks different. Would it be okay? It says he was an idol singer. They say celebrities and shamans share similar fate. On top of that, special discount. Are you having a hard time now? Are you disappointed in yourself and feel depressed at times? Have you lost all hope and stopped dreaming? - Yes. - Yes. But, who will console me if I don't do it myself? If you don’t do it now, when can you do it? Do not worry. It’s not too late. I, Handsome Flower Boy, will be with you. - All right! - All right! 24-hour on call! Handsome Flower Boy, the dependable exorcist. Your serenity is my happiness. Hey, is that the evil-spirit-chasing bells? Then, is that the wooden sword made of wild peach wood? Lately, you looked in this mirror a lot, didn’t you? - Yes! - Yes! Mirror is a spiritual path, so one must be careful. If not careful, your souls can get snatched. - Oh, no... - Oh, no... Didn’t you talk to yourself a lot these days? - Yes! - Yes! Then, the ghosts will try to communicate with you. - What do we do? - What do we do? We’re doomed. You can’t have these things in the house. Bad energy seeps in. It’s my roommate. - Charles! - No! Let it go. No! Oh, that's right! It’s over there! Yes, it’s her. Excuse me. Excuse me! Where are you going? Not catching the ghost? - I really didn't know. - What? I really didn’t know there would be real ghosts. - What did you say? - I’m so sorry. What now? You really... M-m-my hair. You fraud! You come here. Give my money back! I knew when you mentioned idol singer. - Yeji, talk it out! Talk! - You fraud! You! Stop her! Stop her! Get out of my way. You fraud bastard! ID Card. Kang Gwi-Doo? It’s Kang Ki-Doo. I wanted to change since I was little, but my shaman grandmother gave me that name, so... Oh, Ki-Doo? I’m Hodoo! Hey, we’re of same age! Gwi-Doo or Ki-Doo or same age! You said prepay on discount period. I sent you the last of all my savings and you, what? Yeji, let’s talk this out. Give my money back! You fraud! My credit card has debt, so the company already... - took it. - What? I'm sorry. I even lost my house, so I sleep in a sauna and I can’t even eat... I’m the idiot. That’s how it is for me. I'm sorry. I’ll pay you back somehow. Ah, hello. Yes, hello. We’re just getting close to each other. But, you haven’t yet gone to the institute? - Oh, I’m going in two days. - Ah... Well, then. Have a good move! I made this. It's okay. Even ghosts need to rest. Wow. It’s different from the way it looks. - Isn't it? It’s tasty, right? - Yes, it’s really delicious. But, how did you end up..? - I do apologize. - No, I just thought.. You might have your reasons. Actually, our family’s been shamans for generations. This is also a family relic. I inherited from my shaman grandmother. Ah, I see. I was told to walk this path, too. But, I really hated it. So, I left home. Maybe because I’m part of a shaman family, I was really interested in singing and dancing. I also got a lot of offers from everywhere. Everyone had high expectations. They said I’ll make it big as soon as I make my debut. On the last day of recording, that’s when things got real bad. I rode it out no matter what. Believing my fate would change. But the more I resisted, I had to suffer even more. I’m really afraid of ghosts. Still, I had to make a living. So, when I talked about things that I saw since I was little, I gained some subscribers. So that’s how I... I am sorry. She’s like that when drunk. We can leave her be. It's alright. Yeji, what’s wrong? You weren’t this bad before. What’s gotten into you? You weren’t this bad when you got drunk. This... This.. This is unfair! Wait a minute. What’s going on over there? What’s all this? What's going on? There’s... there’s... This is the police. Please come out now! It’s always the same thing. I’m so sick of this. What is this about? I know, right. It’s bad luck when you go to that house. I wonder if there really is a ghost. A ghost? The woman who lived there committed suicide, you know. Ah, you mean the victim of the hidden camera? You remember, right? We responded to a call a couple of months ago. But, didn’t she say that she found footage of the suspect? She did, after doggedly searching for it. Did you catch? So, did you catch the criminal? You said the footage with the criminal was found. But, the criminal was wearing a mask. I guess that must’ve made her feel more hopeless. The suspect cleverly hid the camera in the fire alarm. So, all kinds of things probably got filmed. So, I think that's why she chose to commit suicide. Maybe it wasn't suicide! She even left a suicide note for the detective in charge. It’s sad with those videos still circulating around. Enough to make her turn in her grave. Yeji. Wanna eat something? You haven’t eaten a thing since yesterday. Yeji. She came to tell us something. But, we didn’t even catch that. The more I think about it, I feel so sorry. I feel like a real idiot. But... I don’t know what I can do. That makes re even more angry. I found it. Huh? There must be something. There must be. Hey, just now. What was that? It’s a camera. Mom! Mom, I passed! Yeah, I really passed this time. Mom, now I’ll really be a good son to you. Yes, I'll go see you tomorrow. Can't wait to have a meal with you, Mom. Hey. Yeah, my treat today. Why? You're not free today? Why? You're not free today? Please. Please. Please. Please. Please. Detective Lee JungHo What's taking them so long? No... No... Public Administration Exam Study Guide Fuck. Fuck! Where are you? - Hey. - Over here! Here! Hey, catch that bastard! Hey, you! Stop right there! Stop! Hey you! Stop right there! I’ll go this way, you that way. Yeah, okay. - And you go back home. - Why? Because it’s dangerous! The police are here, so hurry back home. Go back home now! At first, I was just playing around. But, when I uploaded it online, people looked up to me. In reality, I wasn’t even shit. And, now I’m finally about to fulfill my dream. So, Why. Do I. Have to. Ruin my life for that one bitch? I worked so hard to pass the exam. I gave my all and just barely made it, so why should I... You bastard! Yeji. You crazy bastard! What about my life that you ruined? What about my life? What about my life? What about my life? Hodoo! Hodoo. Hodoo... Hodoo! Hodoo! Hodoo. Hodoo, Hodoo! Hey! I thought Hodoo bastard died! So, you cried? Cried your eyes out? Such a worrier since childhood. Thought I won’t get the money back. My $15,000. I’m still injured. I’m hurt. Aren’t I? Ah, don’t cry. It’s all fine. Now, everything’s fine. Oh, you showed off your skills! Sohee... On! Thank you. Actually... It's my first time to have done something right. Me, too. It's my first time to have properly helped anyone. Me, too. Hey, you! Do you have somewhere to go? How about you? Got money? How about we do something properly? An exorcism start-up? An exorcism start-up? Think about it. We did it in the end, right? Yeah! Who says we can't do it? Let’s try it. Okay? - What’s going on now? - What’s happening? Hey, are you sure you did the ritual right? I learned from my grandmother, but I forgot some parts, so... Ah, come on! Hello. What brings you here? Sir, how’d you get in? Should I get you some water? You guys... That person... is a ghost! Subs OCR'd/cleaned by RSG. Thanks to 25tab.
