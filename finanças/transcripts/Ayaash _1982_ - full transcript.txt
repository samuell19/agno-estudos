"May this beautiful night not end!" "Must not end!" "The union of tune and songs brings pleasure and color." "The union of tune and songs brings pleasure and color." "May the colorful stories of such revelry never end!" "May this beautiful night not end!" Is this Thakur Jaswant Singh's villa? - Yes! Whom do you want to meet, sir? - Sansar sir. Go in and meet the accountant. Here. Bottle gourd, gourd and banana. You brought just this much? There was nothing else, accountant. Is it that or you gobbled up everything? - No! Take me for a fool? Ramu. - Yes, sir. Send this home. - Okay, sir. What've you brought, Mangru? Accountant, I've got a bag full of rice. You didn't pay the tax for 2 years. And you've brought only one bag of rice? How will I face Thakur sir? Why, accountant? Just yesterday I gave you two bags of rice. Why are you laughing? I'll teach all of you a lesson! Listen! - Yes. Are you the accountant? - Any doubt? No, I had, but now there's none. Don't laugh! Tell me! What do you want? I want to meet Sansar sir. - Is this the time to meet? He'd called me in the morning. - Let the dawn break. It's already dawn. The clock doesn't affect timings here! - Then? The time runs according to Thakur sir's wish. Understood? Accountant! - Come, Adalat! Everything fine? Money. - What? So soon? Thakur sir is awake. - What? Take this. Is this the entire sum, accountant? The bag seems light. - What are you saying? You're Thakur sir's special man. Can I lie to you? The money is what we receive every day. Fine, accountant. God judges everything. Listen. - Yes. I want to meet Sansar sir. - Sansar! He'll come before senior sir's arrival. - When will senior sir come? By 4 o'clock. He got up early today. He got up early today. So he might come early. Right now, he's praying. Great! - Wow! Keep it here! - That's great! Give me hot tea. Keep it. We'll take it on our own. Yes, on our own. Keep it. - Thank you! Janki sir! - Yes! Drink tea. - Ok! The tea is marvelous! - After all, it is Thakur sir's tea! Sansar sir. - Amal, you've come. I came in the morning. - In the morning? You told me to come in the morning. Listen to him! I didn't mean morning according to you. I meant Thakur sir's morning. Have a seat. - Sit. Have you spoken to Thakur sir about me? - Yes. Will my work be done? Look at him. Amal, you don't know Sansar sir's position. That's why you are talking like this. You'll know gradually. - Yes! It'll be done. - Yes. It's 4 o'clock. - Adalat is here. Sir hasn't come. - He'll come. Have tea. Adalat. - Yes. Is sir coming? - Yes. It's the time for him to come. Sir is coming! - He's coming! Greetings, sir. Greetings. Come. Sit. Give. Here. Sir, since the past 3 months, you've not signed, on the expenses records. Why? - You were busy with your work. So I didn't want to disturb you. Work goes on all day. I just don't have time. Right! - Yes! But that mustn't keep the records pending for 3 months. Sir, this pen is precious. Sir, signature. Here. With this pen, sir. - Yes! Is everything fine? - Yes. Everything's fine. You just have to sign on it. Say that. - Here. So, Mr. Sansar. Here. - Any latest news? Sir, the news is latest and unique too. First finish off with his work. Then I'll tell you everything. Here. - How many signatures are left? Sir, only one or two more. This is fine. Sir, these are the legal documents. If I don't submit it by tomorrow in the court, we'll lose 300000. Why are you here? - What? Tell me! Do I give pay you for nothing? Then you try to scare me about losses. Scaring Thakur Jaswant Singh! Shame on you, lawyer! You talk about losses when the treasure box is brimming with money! That was a lowly comment. Lawyer, cleanse yourself with the religious water. And for that, you'll get a raise of 10 or 20 rupees. - What? Thank you, sir! Then I'll do one thing. I'll make a power of attorney in my name. You won't need to sign so many times. Power of attorney! Did you hear that, Sansar? - Yes. A raise in the salary has made his mind sharp. Now he'll sign. Take this. Come on, laugh. Who is he? - I.. Sir, his is Amal Kumar. He belongs to a nice family. He passed his BA from Muzarffarpur. Where? - From Muzarffarpur. I stay there. I see! That makes you my brother-in-law. - What? His wife is from Muzarffarpur. - Understood? So that makes you sir's brother-in-law. Yes, brother-in-law. What do you do nowadays? He's unemployed. He had a photography shop. Couldn't pay the rent. So the shop was confiscated. By the way sir, he's a good photographer. Really! - Yes. Then you can work here from tomorrow. Click my snaps. Do you have camera? Or is that confiscated too? I have that. Where do you stay? - My cousin sister lives 10 miles away. I stay with her. My camera is there. Why there? Live in our guesthouse. Janki stays there too. - Okay. Adalat. - Yes. Make arrangement for his stay at the guesthouse. - Ok. What's your name? - Amal. Amal, get your luggage tomorrow. Fine? - Okay. Brother-in-law! I've got sweets! Eat it! It's hot. What's all this? Amal has found a job at Thakur sir's place. He's leaving. He's leaving? - Yes. Brother-in-law! Shankar brother, you've come? What are you carrying? He's got sweets for you. Eat it. For me? Give it to me. No! I won't! What do you think of yourself? - Why? What happened? What's the trouble here? Why are you leaving? There's no trouble. But.. - But what? One should work too. You may work anywhere you want! But what's the need to leave home? Thakur sir asked me to stay there. He'll open the shop soon. What shop? He'll make you slog like others! Why are you so angry? I've often told you to get him a job in your office. You can't do that! - Working for the Englishmen doesn't suit a decent man. I'm going to quit. - You say this countless times in a day. Only because of you! If I didn't have to worry about the expenses, I would've never worked. What? What did you say? The same thing that all husbands say to their wives. Brother-in-law, think before you speak. Yes! You can do anything that you want. But I can't do anything! He's got a job. And she has packed his bag. I'm nothing in this house! I don't care about this world! Aruna, don't feel bad about whatever he said. You know that he has a clear heart. I know everything. Actually, he's very sad because you're leaving. I know. You explain to him later. - Yes! I'll get a rickshaw. Bye, Aruna. Are you really leaving? I'll come to visit you at times, Shankar brother. No! No need to pacify me by saying this. What do you think? If you leave, I'll be hurt? No! Not at all! I'm happy! Very happy! Go! Go and sit! Go, driver! Go! You're leaving! But remember one thing. You'll have to return some day! Understood? You'll have to return! He thinks that if he goes away, I'll be hurt. Come, Amal! - Greetings, Thakur sir. You've arrived at the guesthouse? - Yes. Have a seat. Sansar, what were you saying about that helpless woman? Not much, sir. An idiot used to stay nearby. She got trapped in his words. And that idiot eloped with her. Eloped with her? - Yes. What's her age? - Only 18 years. Only 18 years! - Yes! She's a minor. And that idiot ran away with her? Sir, when she dances, it seems like instead of anklets, lightening is striking in her feet. But what's the use now? He ran away with her! And you couldn't do anything? Sir, I'm a poor man. What could I do? If you couldn't, you should've told me! Was I dead? Sir, you shouldn't talk like this. Yes. Don't talk inauspiciously on a Tuesday, sir. Forget all that! That poor woman is being harassed. She's only 18 years old. God knows where and in which state she is? Poor girl! - Poor girl! By the way sir, I've found out her whereabouts. Then why don't you tell me? You're just going on talking rubbish. Shouldn't we help her? - Yes! We should! Then come on! Get up! Come! C'mon! Hurry up! Amal, can you click snaps in the dark? - Yes. I've the arrangement. Very good! It's good to have a camera during such times. There should be a record of our doings. - Record? Yes. Meaning document. Come and get the camera. Amal, you don't even drink. It's not good. No, alcohol doesn't.. - Alcohol? You call this alcohol? This is nectar. Drink a bit. You'll be purified. No. If I drink now, the documents will get spoilt. If you drink, the documents will get spoilt? How? What if I sway while clicking the snaps? Really? You sway after drinking? Sansar, did you hear that? He sways after drinking. No! But there's always a danger! Fine, you can drink later. Sansar sir, how much further? - Sir, we'll be there soon. Look! We've reached! Stop! Sir, you sit here. I'll go and check out. Why? Why will you go alone? Sir, I'll go and check if the idiot who had eloped with her is nearby or not. Fine. Go. - Yes. Come soon. - Yes, sir. Sansar is a useful man. Kamali! Who? - Kamali! Sansar sir, you? Kamali, Thakur sir has come. But I'm feeling very scared. - Why are you afraid? Fall on his feet as soon as he comes. And do what I've told you. - Ok. My darling, you've become lucky. Now think about me too. Get ready quickly. I'll get him. Right now. Fine. Sir, come. She is crying uncontrollably. Why's she crying now? I've come. Sir, that idiot betrayed her and ran away. - Yes! Ran away? - Yes. She's all alone? - Yes. Then let's go. - Come. Come. Such a filthy place. - Take this, sir. Sir, finish this. It doesn't look good. This is the house. Come. Come, sir. Kamali. Now why are you crying? Sir has come after hearing your sad story. At least show your face. Very good! Sir, I can't show my face to anybody! What are you doing? The person I loved betrayed me. Whatever god does is for the best. Sir, I don't have anybody! What will I do now? Don't worry! I'm here. Get up. Tears don't suit your eyes. Wipe them off. This youth and this beauty are not to be wasted. Come. Come with me. Come. Wow! Sansar, wow! Amal, is your camera ready? - Yes, sir. Everything is ready. Just tell me what I've to click. She is an 18 years old girl gorgeous girl. She knows 18 types of arts. Click snaps of her each art's pose. - Okay. Come. Come close. What happened? Sansar, is she the beauty that can be only seen? Nobody has taught her anything? Sir, she is a nave girl. Fresh from the garden! Gradually she'll learn everything. Fine. I'll teach her everything gradually. Take this. This is the first art. No. C'mon. Take a sip. Sansar, Amal is very talented. He clicked the snap at the right time. Yes! It's very stuffy here! Come on! Let's go and sit outside in the fresh air! C'mon! Get up! C'mon! - Let's go. Let's go in the open air! C'mon! We'll drink outside! Just a sip. Very good. Sansar sir. - What's it? Nothing. I don't understand why do you con Thakur sir like this? What do you mean? I can't understand the meaning. That's why I am asking. Listen! I gave you the job and now you.. No, I'm indebted to you for that. If you hadn't brought me here, how could I get to see all this? Enough! Keep on watching quietly! Keep quiet. And earn money! Understood? That's what I am doing. "The youth of these flowers." "This lovely morning." Wow! You sing so well! Sing more! Will you like it? Why not? Sing a song. "It recites the tale of the passed twilight." "It recites the tale of the passed twilight." "This lovely dawn." "The childhood of buds and the youth of flowers." "The childhood of buds and the youth of flowers." "This lovely dawn." "This lovely dawn." "All the stars went away to a far off place." "The slumber and the dreams went away." "The slumber and the dreams went away." "Before leaving, they gave.." "Before leaving, they gave a memento." "This lovely dawn." "This lovely dawn." "All the birds flew away from each branch." "The travelers walked on their path." "The travelers walked on their path." "It distributes.." "It distributes life to the buds." "This lovely dawn." "This lovely dawn." "I've not forgotten anything." "I've seen this beauty and form somewhere else." "I've seen this beauty and form somewhere else." "It has brought.." "It has brought with it many old memories." "This lovely dawn." "It recites the tale of the passed twilight." "The childhood of buds and the youth of flowers." "This lovely dawn." You're here? Who was singing? - The photographer. The photographer? Who is he? Senior sir gave him a job a few days ago. To click snaps. I see! Come, I'll comb your hair. - Come. Come. Mithu, say Amal. Amal. Say Amal. Amal! Yes! Give it to me, Adalat. I'll stitch the buttons. Okay, daughter-in-law. You're here? I was searching for Munni. I saw Adalat arranging the clothes. So I did it. Adalat does these things properly. That's why he has been kept here. And why did you come to this palace, leaving your own? Where is Bimla? - I've sent her for work. There are other servants too. If there's a shortage, hire some more. But I don't like you leaving your palace and coming here. Understood? Listen! Why have you not worn the jewelry? I don't like it. If you don't like old jewelry, I'll get new ones made. But the women of this family should always wear jewelry. It's about our pride. You may go now. Adalat. - Yes, sir. Send the accountant. - Okay. Did you call me, sir? Inform Hamilton jeweler that my wife needs new jewelry. - Jewelry? Do you have dandruff? Why are you scratching your head? - No, sir. How much will bit cost, sir? We need new jewelry. I don't need to know the cost. It's your work. Not much is left in the bank, sir. If it is so, then arrange for it. Sell 2-4 villas. Will our work stop because of money? I don't want to hear such lowly things. You may go! Okay. Holding the book upside down reveals that your mind is not here. It's somewhere else. Are my thoughts restricted to this palace too? You're still angry? I thought I'll ask you to apply powder on me. - Adalat can do that. That's the custom of this family. Humiliating in front of the servants is the custom of this family? I've atoned for that. I've told Hamilton jewelers to make new jewelry for you. Good! Those will come to your aid after my death! I don't like such talks! Don't talk like this! What should I say to impress you? Actually wife, we got married 3 years ago. We've not formed a strong bond till now. You didn't stop going out even for a single night. I'm helpless. How can I give up the flamboyance that's our family heritage? And you don't even like my drinking habits. Now you tell me. What can I do? You don't have to do anything. Now I'm used to all your habits. If it is so, then you've to tell me the reason for your visit to my palace. Will you accept it, if I tell you? Apart from asking me to give up my habits, I'll accept whatever you say. I want to get a snap clicked. Snap? - Yes. After my death, what memento will be left here apart from my bird's cage and jewelry? If there's a snap, maybe somebody will remember that even I used to stay here. That's it. Fine. To calm you down, I'll break the family custom. I'll surely get your snap clicked. Greetings, photographer. Come, Adalat. What's it? Take all your equipment and come. Really? I've to click your snap? I'll surely click your snap. Your snap is very important in the album of my life. You can click it whenever you want. Senior sir has called you right now. Whose snap do I have to click at this hour? - Daughter-in-law's. Daughter-in-law's snap? - Yes. Did you hear it clearly? Yes. Senior sir has given the command to bring you. Come. I'll take you from the back side path. Back side path? Why? The people here are gossipers. The news will spread immediately that daughter-in-law's snap has been clicked. I see. - Come! Let's go. Bimla. - Yes, Adalat. Sir, we're not allowed to go ahead. Bimla will take you to daughter-in-law's palace. Senior sir is there too. Take this. Come, photographer. You're very lucky, photographer. This has never happened before. - What has not happened? What should I tell you? You'll understand yourself. The photographer has come, sir. Come, Amal. Go and inform your ma'am. - Okay, sir. Today my wife said that she wants her snap clicked. I agreed. - This is great! There should be a snap of both of you. I never realized that before amidst work. I'll make the arrangements. Come, ma'am. Come. Sit. This veil. If you have the veil on, how will your face be seen? He's Amal. No need to feel shy in front of him. Remove your veil. 'Deepa, he's Amal. My cousin brother.' 'He studies in Patna. He has come here for his vacations.' 'Greetings. - Greetings.' 'Brother, she's Deepa. My best friend.' 'Your style of clicking snaps has floored her.' 'And she has come to meet you.' 'With the hope that you'll click her snaps' 'and include it in the album of your life.' Look at this! You've removed your veil. And he went behind his veil. Amal, hurry up. We're getting scorched in the heat. Just 2 minutes. Steady please. 'What a romantic pose! Great!' 'Brother, keep your hand on her shoulder.' 'Deepa, smile.' 'Yes! This is perfect!' 'Look, Deepa. Such beautiful birds.' 'But they're in the bonded in the cage. - Still they're happy.' 'Why is it so, Amal?' 'Because they love each other.' 'And lovers don't accept any bondage or restrictions.' 'They remain happy at any cost.' 'What if one of them separates from the other?' 'People say the other dies due to the pain of separation.' 'Amal. - Deepa.' 'Amal!' 'Mother said that your uncle has banished you.' 'Yes, Deepa.' And instead of apologizing to your uncle, you're clicking snaps here?' 'Not snaps. I'm collecting my memoirs.' 'My uncle snatched away my belongings due to dad's loan.' 'But nobody can take my memories away.' 'Will you really go away, Amal?' 'Yes, Deepa.' 'My family has disowned me. What other option do I have?' 'Amal, I won't be able to live without you!' 'Take me along! - No, Deepa.' 'There's a boundary of love. We don't have the right to cross it.' 'Wait for me, Deepa.' 'Some day, I'll surely come back. And I'll marry you.' 'Amal. - Deepa.' 'Don't cry, Deepa.' 'Be strong! Smile and bid me farewell.' 'Won't you come along with me for a while?' 'Come.' "The birds fly away. The cage remains where it is." "The birds fly away. The cage remains where it is." "Oh boatman!" "Memories of people who go away torment us." "The birds fly away. The cage remains where it is." "The birds fly away. The cage remains where it is." "So many monsoons came and went away." "Showering for so many years." "So many monsoons came and went away." "Showering for so many years." "But traveler doesn't return home." "The birds fly away. The cage remains where it is." Here it is. - So soon! You play so well! Enough! Not any more! You all may leave. Ma'am, shall I give you a foot massage? What's your salary, Bimla? Only 40 rupees, ma'am. You'll get 10 rupees more from next month. It's your grace. Take this. For me? - Yes. I'm thinking of getting more snaps clicked. Great! Surely do it! Can you bring the photographer? - What? But bring him here on sly. Don't worry! Nobody will know. I'll bring him as soon as I can. - Fine. Bimla, you? What's it? I've come to take you with me. Me? Why? Ask all this later. Right now the villa is isolated. Come. But with you at this hour? I don't understand. You're a man. Why fear? Come with me. Come. Why is it so dark here? Lower your voice. I've switched off the lights. Come with me! Come! Come. Ma'am! You may leave, Bimla. - Okay. Come. You didn't do the right thing, Deepa. - What? You called me on the sly. You didn't give me the right to meet you in public. I wish you'd waited for me. Amal, I couldn't do anything. When you went away I stood watching you leave by the river bank. 'Suddenly a gun shot startled me.' He followed me to my house. He met my father and asked for an alliance. I cried a lot. I implored. But nobody listened to me. After that, he married me and brought me here. Then whatever happened made my life miserable. Daughter-in-law is so beautiful! - The palace will light up. There's a jamboree to celebrate the wedding. Sir will come late. Till then, you can rest here. "Listen to me beloved." "My image has been tarnished." "You got bored with me." "And you found dearth in me." "You had gone to the market to buy earrings." "You had gone to the market to buy earrings." "And you brought your mistress along." "And you brought your mistress along." "You had gone to the market to buy earrings." "And you brought your mistress along." "And you brought your mistress along." "You forgot the story of dawn and dusk." "You forgot my youth and my love." "You forgot the memento I gave you." "You got a new woman and you forgot the old woman." "You got a new woman and you forgot the old woman." "Give her! Yes!" "Give her! My earrings." "You had gone to the market to buy earrings." "And you brought your mistress along." "And you brought your mistress along." "Tormentor, you brought your mistress along." "I won't allow you to make any excuse." "If I had known, I wouldn't have allowed you to go out." "I wouldn't have allowed you to ruin my world." "I wouldn't have allowed you to ruin my world." "I can sacrifice. Countless such earrings." "You had gone to the market to buy earrings." "And you brought your mistress along." "You didn't listen to me." "And you brought your mistress along." "Listen to me beloved." "My image has been tarnished." "Listen to me beloved." "My image has been tarnished." I know that everybody is afraid of me. But it won't be good if you're afraid too. Sit. Sit comfortably. Sit. I'm the sole inheritor of all the wealth, money and property of the Thakur family. And from today, you're the sole mistress of this villa. Why did you go away? Come here. Okay! I understood. Today I'll have to take the first step to make you comfortable. When I had seen you from a distance, you looked beautiful. But I hadn't thought you'd be so beautiful. Leave me! I feel like vomiting! Why? Did you eat stale food? No! The odor of alcohol makes me feel nauseous. Whenever you drink, don't try to touch me. You call this odor of alcohol? This is the fragrance of affluent families. Right now you can't differentiate between odor and fragrance. You belong to an ordinary family. That's why you're saying this. Before you, some girls from ordinary families had come here. They too hated alcohol. But gradually they got used to it. You will get used to it after staying here for a few days. Those who got habituated must've been illiterate. I'm not like them. I'm educated. What education is this that keeps the husband away from the wife on the nuptial night? What kind of a husband are you to flirt with filthy girls and come to mock the wedding night in a drunken state? This is the family custom. I don't like such customs. I'll change it. Really? In a single night, you'll change centuries old customs? Do you've guts? I'm not here to talk about guts. But you've brought me here as a wife, not a servant! Wedding night is the beginning of a sacred life. And the first night of my life is not for a playboy, who has slept with filthy women. - Keep quiet! Playboy! Yes! Thakur Jaswant Singh is a playboy! But I'm not dependant on my wife! Listen! In our family a wife gets just one night with her husband! The wedding night! But you forgot your status and lost that night too! 'He went away. He didn't let his night to go waste.' 'But my wedding night ended even before it began.' 'The sun rose.' 'The flowers adorned on the wedding bed withered.' 'And I remained seated on the bed.' 'I tried my best to reform him.' 'But he didn't pay heed.' 'He started living in his villa. I started living in mine.' 'Like a prisoner.' I endured everything considering it to be my fate. To spend time, I got pets and birds. The number of servants increased. Amidst all this, my life became miserable. All the signs of a married woman became a joke. Forgive me, Deepa. I wasn't aware of your plight. Take me away from here, Amal. Take me anywhere. I want freedom. - Deepa! Yes, Amal! I feel choked here! I'll die! Take me away! No, Deepa! No! I'm unlucky! But not a betrayer! I've come to work at Thakur sir's place. Not to rob him. - Amal! Yes, Deepa! I can't do this! And now I think I should leave from here. I should go away! - No, Amal! Don't leave me and go! Luckily, I've found you for the second time. If you leave, I won't have any option but to commit suicide. No! No, Deepa, don't say this! Then for my sake, don't go! I'll endure this imprisonment by seeing you! Promise me, Amal. You won't go. Ok, Deepa. I won't go anywhere. Take this. Keep this in the car. Come, sir! Come! Sansar, is everything ready? Sir, I'm your servant since years. Can there be anything wrong in my work? That's why I say my world is incomplete without you. Wonderful! - Right! Amal is not coming? And where is Janki? Sir, Amal was scared to come. - I see. So Janki has gone to fetch him. He has come! Greetings. - Greetings, Thakur. Amal, I heard you didn't want to come with us. It's not so. I thought I'll sleep for a night. Sleep! Have you gone mad? In youth, nights are not to sleep. Yes! - Really? Come with me. You'll feel better. Sit. Come, sir. You all.. - Let's go with him in the horse-carriage. Today we'll have fun! Hurry up, Adalat. Tell me something, Amal. Why do you always look so lost, sad and worried? I've become habituated to it. I don't agree. There must be something. Are you in love with somebody? - What? Did somebody hurt you? No, Thakur. This is not so. Then be happy. This is the age of merriment! As far as your shop is concerned, don't worry. I'll open that too at the right time. Do you know? Sansar claims that this tour will be unique and lovely. Am I right, Sansar? Sir, I've dressed up Bajri as a bride. Now the beauty is eagerly waiting for you. "Love tortures my heart." "Beauty provides solace to my heart." "I'm a playboy." "I'm a playboy." "Love tortures my heart." "Love tortures my heart." "Beauty provides solace to my heart." "I'm a playboy." "I'm a playboy." "Beauty is a river." "Alcohol flows in it." "On top of that this evening of dances." "This evening of dances." "On this moon lit evening, beauty is by my side. "In my hand, lies the ocean. And obsession in my head." "I'm a playboy." "Love tortures my heart." "Beauty provides solace to my heart." "I'm a playboy." "I'm a playboy." "I don't care about work." "I've penchant for intoxication." "Bartender, mix water and fire and make me have it." "Make me have it." "This is my nature." "This is my habit." "This is what I am. What can I do?" "I'm a playboy." "Love tortures my heart." "Love tortures my heart." "Beauty provides solace to my heart." "I'm a playboy." "I'm a playboy." Sansar, what happened next? - What else, sir? Whatever happens to girls from poor family happened. - Here. It happens! The groom went away! And the girl remained unmarried! She remained unmarried? - Yes. Go away! The girl remained unmarried and you're harassing me! Go away! So, Sansar. Who else is there in her family? Nobody, sir. Only god is the savior. That's the problem with all of you. You leave everything on god! After all, why has god created humans? Tell me! An unmarried girl is helpless! And you all are sitting idle! Sir, this is not so. I've made the arrangements. Really? Then tell me! What is it? First complete this work. Then I'll tell you! You can see I'm busy and yet you're interfering! What's it? Power of attorney! Where do I have to sign? - Here. Take this! Go away! - Thank you! What's the arrangement? Sir, I have sent her to Rang villa. - Sent her. So that you can aid her. Then why were you silent? Let's go! - Come! Come, hurry up! What happened? What are you thinking? I was wondering that you sign without checking the papers. What if there is a blunder? If you've the guts to think about this, then how did you lose everything? I don't have the time to think about all this. Let's go. The photographer isn't there, ma'am. His room is locked. He has gone with sir. - Where? I've heard he has gone to aid some unmarried girl. Take this. Give it to Thakur with your own hands. You will be blessed. Photographer! Enough of clicking snaps. Come here. You join us too. What about these documents? Leave that! Come here! Come! Come! Sit! Sansar. - Take this. Today I'll make you drink. I don't like alcohol, Thakur sir. Don't say no! Alcohol given by Thakur sir is like offerings. - Yes! Drink it. Drink it. - Very good! Now I'll hear your song. - Yes! I don't know singing, Thakur sir. - Don't lie. I heard you singing on the roof of the guesthouse. Yes! - But you might not like my song. Don't worry about that.

I had come to see how you look after tonight's party. You must be drunk! Wow! Today you too are fragrant like the Thakurs of this family. But you didn't do the right thing by coming here. Why not? You all can go to a girl's house to have fun. And I can't even come here? If you've some alcohol, then give it to me. - Deepa! I'll also satiate my craving. Let me also dance with you after drinking. Deepa, I'm really ashamed. Thakur sir forced me. And you drank? Couldn't you refuse? In future he'll ask you to do something else. You'll do it? Amal! I respect only you. I trust you. Don't break my trust. At least you don't be like him. That's all. I had come to say this. Surajgard's treasurer received a punishment of 50 whips for embezzlement of funds worth 50,000 rupees. And.. - What? Surajgard's treasurer received a punishment of 50 whips for embezzlement of funds worth 50,000 rupees. Accountant, senior sir is awake. He was whipped? No, whips! Senior sir has woken up. So soon? Sir is awake? - Yes. Then why are you reading out the news to me? Go and read out the news to sir. - Yes! Greetings! The main news is that on the death anniversary of Lokmaniya Tilak, the British were unjust for bringing out a rally in Mumbai. The British government fired bullets at the rally. What rubbish are you talking! - I am reading the newspaper. Did I call for you? I heard that you've woken up. So.. - What! Go away! Go! - Yes! Sir, if you could look at this record. - I don't care about the records! Fine. Forget it. Adalat! Adalat! Sir! Yes, sir! - Why are you harping about sir? What's the time? Now it is only 10 o'clock. Today you got up early? If you want, you can have another nap. - Again nap! Fool! Have Sansar and Janaki come? Sir, normally you don't wake up so early. So they.. I don't wake up! My wish! They should be here on time! You may leave! Greeting, Thakur. - Come, Amal. Have a seat. What are you carrying? - Snaps. I went on clicking. But you've still not seen it. So many snaps? Wow! You've clicked many poses. I didn't even come to know. It implies that I'll have to be careful about you. It's good! The snaps are very good! But these girls aren't nice! I wanted to say it earlier too! Adalat. - Yes, sir. Keep this. - Yes, sir. Carefully. - Yes, sir. These girls are conning you, Thakur sir. What do you think? I don't know who all are conning me? I know everything. But there is a fun in being conned. There is a strange happiness. - Yes. I wanted to say one more thing. - Yes. I'm leaving. You are leaving? Why? My health isn't fine. And I've stayed here for a long time. I'll forever be indebted to you. - For what? I've still not given you the money to open the shop. No problem. If I am destined, then I'll get a shop. Anything else? No. - You may leave! Sir! You fool! Go away from here! Ma'am! Sir is very infuriated. Nandu went to tell him something. And he slapped him hard. What's new? Nandu is lucky. He'll get a raise. No! Sir is angry because the photographer is leaving. What? Adalat! - Yes, sir! Why is Amal leaving? I don't understand, sir. This has never happened before. Whoever has come here, has settled here permanently. And today! Go and call him. - Yes! Wait! I'll go! Listen! I want to know the real reason for your leaving. Actually, I'm not well. If you aren't well, then stay here and take treatment. Go and see a doctor. If you want to stay away from my parties, then I can permit you to stay away. But I won't permit you to leave. It's better if I leave. - I will think about that! There are some customs of this family. Whoever comes here, stays here for good. Understood? And listen to one more thing. If you tried to leave without my permission, then I'll get you arrested for the crime of robbery and bring you here again. Munni! Where are you? Bimla! - Have you seen my Munni somewhere? My cat? I didn't see the cat or Munni. I can see only you. - What? Will you gobble me up! Move! - Talk calmly! Munni! Where are you? - Bimla! Munni! Where are you? - What's it, Bimla? Sir, have you seen my Munni? No? Tear it after reading. Munni! Where are you? 'Come tonight. I will be waiting for you.' If I hadn't called, then you would've left without meeting me. Am I right? Deepa, I think it's wrong to meet secretly like this. My conscience doesn't agree to it. I feel I'm betraying Thakur sir. And what about me? Were you playing with me? Deepa! Do you recognize this? Or you've forgotten this too? Wasn't this a trust and a promise? 'Deepa, my mother has given me this locket.' 'For her daughter-in-law. This is my promise to you.' 'And for me this is a wedding garland.' 'I'll always wear this.' 'I'll keep a small snap of yours inside this.' 'What's the need for a snap when I'm here?' 'What if you forget me?' 'No!' 'This will never happen. - Amal!' 'This will never happen. - Amal!' You forgot all that? I didn't forget anything. But.. - What? Now you're Thakur sir's wife. If somebody snatches someone's memento, it doesn't belong to him. Deepa! Don't disrespect my love. If you can say it, then say. That you still don't love me. No. I won't be peaceful by refusing. I love you. That's why I want you to belong to the person who is married to you. There's a huge difference between marriage and hunting! I'm his prey. Just like the lions' heads on the wall, I'm just an adornment in this villa. Even after knowing all this, you're taking that playboy's side! He made me his prey! This season! This rainfall! And this flash of lightening! Any girl will embrace you out of fear. Today Basanti is very lucky, sir. She'll be lucky if we reach there. Sir, we'll reach there soon. And this white horse will not stop. But sir, if you had brought the car instead of this, we would've reached by now. Sansar. - Yes. You think I'm a fool? - Why, sir? Water doesn't make a difference to the horse. - Yes! But once the water enters the engine, the car will break down. What has happened to your brains, Sansar? How could you even think like this about Thakur sir? How did you even think? The rain has made my brain numb. Now no matter how much it rains, this foreign horse won't stop. Kasim! What happened? Sir, the horse isn't moving ahead. Then whip him! Rip his skin apart! How will he not proceed ahead? Will you kill us? Adalat! - Yes, sir? What happened, Kasim? - The horse fell down. Adalat! - Yes, sir? What happened? The horse fell down. The carriage can't proceed. Do we've to be in the rain for the whole night? Kasim! Yes, sir. How did the horse fall down? Do you gobble his entire food? Sorry, sir. - Keep quiet! You spoilt my mood! Adalat! Make arrangements to return. - Yes, sir. Give me. Cover this. Sir, go and change. Or you'll catch cold. - No, it's fine. Shall I arrange your bed? No, Adalat. Do one thing. How will they go in this heavy rainfall? Let them sleep in my room. Today I'll sleep in the upstairs room. Nandu, where are you going? - Sir has come. A terrible thing has happened, ma'am! Senior sir has returned! - What? This has never happened before. He's coming here to sleep. - Here? Yes! Bimla, take him away from the back path. - Yes! Quickly - Come, sir! Come! You had said that to strengthen our bond, I didn't stop going out at night. Did I surprise you? Today I proved you wrong. Adalat said you'll need alcohol. Keep it. But you don't like the odor of alcohol, do you? I'm used to the odor now. You're standing so far away. I don't think you're saying the truth. Fine, I'll believe you. Since you can endure its fragrance, I'll have it. Bimla! Bimla! Yes, sir. How did this gent's handkerchief come here? Actually.. - Did the laundryman come here? Laundryman? - Did the laundryman come here? Yes! He came just now! Tomorrow onwards, my wife villa's laundryman and the outside laundryman should be different. Got it? - Yes. Take this away! Why are you crying, darling? I didn't say anything to you. Look at me. Hail the lord! Goddess, have mercy! Listen! Yes. - Where do you disappear all the time? What do you want? I'm going to the office! I'm getting late! Fine. - Close the door. Oh no! Now what? Now what? You didn't give my pills. - Pills? Yes. - I had kept it on the table. You didn't take it? No. - Let me see. I had kept it here. Where did it go? Did you keep it in your pocket? No, that's why I am saying! You can check! What is this? - Yes! That's why I was thinking that while changing, I had a pill. - You did. Yes! After that.. How can you work for the British with such a mind? I won't do it! Now I won't do it! What happened? Now what happened? Why did you lie down? You taunted me! You challenged me! Now I won't work for them! Fine! But until you don't leave the job, you'll have to go to office. Get up! No! Aruna! Shankar brother! Brother-in-law, come! Why have you come here? Great! You told me in the villa that Aruna has called me. You asked me to come. I did, right? - Yes. Heard that? I had told him. And you say that I forget every time. Did I need give a second message to call him? Fine, forgive me. Now get up! Brother-in-law, I'm getting late for the office. We'll talk in the evening. - Fine. You've forgotten us, brother. I think Thakur sir has cast a spell on you. - No, fool! How can I forget you? I don't have anybody else in this world. Why didn't you visit us for so long? Actually I'm stuck in a trouble. Trouble? What trouble? Do you remember Deepa? Deepa? Where did you meet her? I heard she had got married to some landlord. Thakur Jawant Singh is the one. I see! So this is your trouble? Brother, what relation do you've with her now? Now she belongs to somebody else. Deepa is unhappy. And Thakur sir is not a nice husband. But brother, you can't change her fate. So what will you do by staying there? You won't understand that. I don't want to understand either! And I don't want you to stay there. Your brother-in-law will get your luggage tomorrow. No, Aruna. I've promised her. I'll have to stay there. - Brother! Listen to me! Don't waste your life like this! Forget Deepa and settle down. I'm getting late. I'll leave. Brother! Listen to me! Tell me, lawyer. Did you build up a fortune? Accountant, you're the one who looks after it. How can I do it in your presence? Greetings, accountant. - Kasim, come. What brings you here? - Today is the 15th. And we've not got the wages. - How will I give you wages? There's no recovery. Lawyer is sitting here. Ask him about our state. Yes, Kasim. Our state is ready bad. Even we've not received the fees. - Did you hear that? When we've money, you'll get the wages. Now go away! - Fine. Accountant, sir has called you all. - What? Sir has woken up? - Yes. Come! - Come, accountant! Come, lawyer! Sir, you called me? Of course I did. I've heard that you've built a huge villa in your village? Sir, it's just a small hut. Small hut! Why haven't the servants got their wages? The condition is very bad, sir. No farmer is giving the tax. There's no recovery at all. - And you all are sitting idle? We've filed a case on the farmers. - Yes. The hearing is in the next month. - Yes. The hearing is in the next month! And the case will drag on for 5-6 years! Lawyer, I want money! I have so many houses, property and land. Sell anyone for a good price! But I want the money within 2 days. Thakur sir, everything is being sold one after the other. What is more precious? The honor of Thakur family or a piece of land! Answer me! Forgive me. The court expenses are compulsory. But we can reduce the villa's expenses. No! Never! Till the time I'm alive, the honor of Thakur family will remain intact. Everything will go on as it used to. But, sir.. - I don't like to argue! Do as I say! Go! - Yes! Sir! Come soon! Daughter-in-law has fainted! - Why? What happened? Congratulations, Thakur sir. Your wife is pregnant. You're going to be a proud father. Thank you, doctor. - Its all right. Doctor. - Yes. Here. - Is that for me? Yes. - Thank you. Did you all understand what the doctor said?

Command? What command? It's your sister's order to get you along with your luggage. Will you wear this shoes or.. - What's this? Listen to me. Tell it to your sister. Here. I've have kept this too. And your suitcase is ready. But is it right to leave anybody's house without reason? It implies you don't want to go. It's not so. There should be a reason. I can't leave just leave! - What do you brother sister duo think of me? Am I an animal that can be dragged? And what's your work? You serve the landlord! Aren't you ashamed? Fine, at least sit. I don't want to sit! I don't care about both of you! Why am I worried? If you want, then come. If Aruna wants, she'll come. Why have you harassed me? I'm leaving! Shankar brother, listen to me! - I don't want to listen! I won't stop. I'm leaving. Ma'am, the photographer has come. Fine, you can leave. Did you call me? - Yes. You don't come if I don't. Have a seat. I want to talk to you about something. Tell me. I've spent half the imprisonment of my life by looking at you. The rest of my life too will pass away. But what about Naresh? Why? What happened to him? Living in this atmosphere, he's becoming like him! One more Thakur! To carry on the traditions. You're the only person who can make him a human. You can save him from a curse. Save him, Amal! I'll try, Deepa. Amal! Amal! I've always asked for favors from you. But I didn't give you anything. What is this give and take? Life isn't a book of accounts. Then what happened, Munna? I gave 1 rupee to the watchman and he opened the school gate. Then? - Then we went to the theatre. And we saw the movie. Naresh! What's going on? From where did you learn all the bad habits? Who are they? My friends. I was talking to my friends. What's bad about it? - Keep quiet! You don't even have etiquette. You're talking to your friends! You don't want to go to the school? I'm not feeling well. - If you're unwell, go upstairs and rest. You all go away. Come on! Go! You go upstairs. And henceforth, you won't miss your school. No chat sessions anymore! Understood?! Go. What happened? Why are you crying? They always scold me. Who scolded you? The photographer. In front of all the friends! He scolded my friends and told them to go away. What did you do? - Nothing. Who were your friends? - They were from affluent families. Chaudhary's son, Sher Singh. Raj Bahadur from the palace. I was talking to my friends. The photographer came. He started scolding. Asked me to go upstairs and rest. Humiliated me in front of my friends! He always does that. Fine. Don't cry. You go and play. I'll see who dares to scold you. Did you call me? What's going on, Amal? - What? You're always scolding Naresh. The teacher comes to teach and you interfere in that too. What's all this? I want to make him a human being. You want it? Who gave you this right? Naresh is my son or yours? Who are you? Follow the norms while staying here. Do your work. I don't want to hear this complaint again. - But.. You may go. Why did you close the door? - What if somebody comes? We're not afraid. We're not stealing anything. No. - Raju, take out the bottle. Okay. Serve it. Everybody can have it. I won't drink it. I'm scared. Scared? Did you all hear it? He is scared! His name is Sher(lion) Singh! But he's a coward! Drink it! No! - Drink it! Drink it! Hurry up! You've reached this level? You've learned all this too? Henceforth if you touch alcohol, I'll break your bones! Go away! Go away right now! How dare you! You hit Naresh! Why did I hit him? Listen to the reason at least. I don't want to hear anything! Even after forbidding you, you dared to hit Naresh! - Yes. He parties with his friends at such a young age. He is drinking right from now. - He's doing the right thing! He belongs to the Thakur clan! He'll do whatever he wants! Thakur sir, it's not right to pamper him so much. Who are you to talk about such things? My son might go to hell! It's none of your business! Go away from here right now or.. - Or else? You'll banish me? Right? No need for that Thakur sir. I'm leaving. I scolded him a bit and he went away. Sansar, you brought a useless man! Janaki. - Yes. You too were there. - Yes. Did I say anything wrong to Amal? No, sir. He doesn't have brains. - Yes! Sir, forget Amal! He's a fool! He left the villa and went away! Now he'll wander for the rest of his life! Yes! What else will he do? Yes! - He was a fool! Yes! Sir, all the arrangements are done for the dance. - Forget the dance! Sir! What happened? Did you find him? No, sir. I searched for him far and wide. I didn't find the photographer. - Lock his room up! He'll come to take his luggage! I'll see how he moves out. Sir! Ma'am has called you. Where's she? In the adjoining room. Don't worry. Have faith. Why did you come here? I've forbidden you, right? Why did you banish him? - Who? The photographer. Who told you? The entire villa knows this. He slapped Naresh. He did the right thing! I see! So you've come to fight on behalf of Amal? Why do you feel pity for him suddenly? You won't understand! But even I've a relation with Naresh. You're his dad but do you know what you've made him? - Wife! What is Naresh becoming? He's becoming a playboy. He'll be immersed in alcohol when he grows up. He'll spend his nights with cheap women! Who said that? Mind your language! No! I won't let Naresh become like you! He'll become another playboy! I don't want that. Wife, keep quiet. Or.. Or what? You'll kill me? Take this! Shoot! And kill me! What are you thinking? Kill me! Go away from here! Go away! Ma'am! - What happened? Ma'am! - Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am! Hail! - The motherland! Hail! - The motherland! Hail! - The motherland!

You'd said one day I'll have to come back. So I've come. Come.. Listen! Look! Who has come! Who has come? Who's it? Brother! Come! Look at your plight! The British have thrashed him badly. - Oh god! Sit. Lie down. Put his leg up. Water. I'll just get it. - Water. Get water. - My throat is parched. Brother-in-law, you rest here. I'll get the doctor. Why are you worried, brother-in-law? It's a matter of a few days. - No! Even the doctors can't do anything. - No, brother-in-law. You'll be fine. I'll get the doctor. You rest. I'll just come. I'm going to get the doctor. You sit with Amal. Okay. - Don't tell him about Deepa's death. Or he won't be able to endure it. - Ok. Understood? Go! I'll just come! Adalat. - Yes, sir. All the arrangements are over? - Yes, sir. The guest room has been cleaned. And the band too has come. The sari vendor will be here soon. Did you go to the Madhu Sudhan jeweler? - Yes. When will he deliver the jewelry? - By tomorrow. The work is going on. Ok. - Ok. Listen! Put it till here. Sir, look at this sari. It's pure Banarasi silk. The pride of rich people like you. Is it real gold? - Yes. Ok! Keep all of these! Keep all of these! Sir, yesterday I had gone to Peeli villa. Don't talk about them here. They survive by taking loan. I'll make the payment by cash. Sir, this is what I told them. Thakur sir's money is in the bank. - Yes, it is in the bank! Tell me! Where does the band play 7 days prior to the day? Nowhere except sir's house. Adalat! - Yes! Keep all these things. - Ok. Sir. Sir. Accountant. - Yes, sir. Settle his accounts. - Okay. Come with me. The clothes are very nice. - Wow! I had danced in sir's wedding too. Sir, greetings. - Yes, Madhu Sudhan. Is the jewelry ready? 1 or 2 are left. I'll get everything tomorrow. Then why did you come today? Sir, I want to talk to you urgently. Why? Even you want money? Oh no! I can't even think of this! Sir, I want to talk to you about something in private. In private? Fine, I'll come later. - No, wait! You all.. Okay, sir. We'll sit outside. Come on. I was melting your wife's old jewelry to make new ones. I found this locket. It has a snap. I thought it must be somebody's memento. So I brought it to show you before breaking it. Look. Did you make this? No, sir. Do you remember properly? Very well, sir. I've not made it. Fine. You may leave. Greetings! Come! I said get out! Adalat! - Yes, sir. Where's Naresh? He's gone to distribute his wedding cards to his friends. Stop this! - Sir! Stop this clarinet! Stop it! Stop it! Stop this clarinet! 'You've brought me here as a wife, not a servant.' 'The wedding night is the beginning of a sacred life.' 'And this first night of my life is not for the playboy who' 'sleeps with countless cheap women!' 'I want to make Naresh a human being.' 'You want it?' 'Who gave you this right?' 'Naresh is my son or yours?' Amal! Amal! Amal! Amal! Amal! Amal! Amal! Amal! Amal! Amal! Amal! Amal! Amal! 'Don't waste your life for Deepa's sake.' 'Just think of what will happen if Thakur sir comes to know?' 'Your sister, Aruna.' Doctor. - I've given the injection. But there's no hope that he'll survive. Pray to god. Nothing else can be done. Your fees. - Thank you. Does Amal stay here? - Yes, but who are you? My name is Thakur Jaswant Singh. Where's he? His state is very bad. - I don't care! Is he alive? See him. Amal! Amal! Listen! Open your eyes! Listen! Open your eyes! Open your eyes! I say open your eyes! Did you recognize me? I'm Thakur Jaswant Singh! Recognized me? Yes. This locket! Did you give this to my wife? You gave this to my wife? Answer me! Did you give it to her? Yes! - Why did you? What was your relation with her? Tell me! Whose son is Naresh? Mine or yours? Tell me! Tell me! Whose son is Naresh? Brother! No! You can't keep quiet. You'll have to answer me! How can he answer you now? There is nobody left to answer you. He'll give me the answer. This man will answer me. He can't defeat me like this! What have you done? Are you mad? You shoot a dead person! Aren't you ashamed? How did he hurt you? - Sir. Come, sir. Why did you shoot him? - What's going on? Brother-in-law! - Brother! Sir. Sir. Sir. Junior master! 'Why did you banish him?' 'He slapped Naresh.' 'He did the right thing!' 'I see! So you've come to fight on behalf of Amal?' 'Why do you feel pity for him so suddenly?' 'You won't understand!' 'You're his dad but do you know what you've made him?' Greetings, lawyer. - Hello. Have you purchased a new car? - Yes. It's very nice. I've got a very bad news for you, son. There is bad news. What happened? - The high court decided against us. They have seized it. - Seized it. We can't save this villa from auction. What're you saying? - But don't worry. It won't be auctioned till the time of your marriage. Junior sir! Come soon! Senior sir isn't well! Oh god! Have mercy! What happened? Father! - Sir!
