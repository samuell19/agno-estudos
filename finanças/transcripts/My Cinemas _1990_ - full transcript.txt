Two movies at Yavuz Cinemas tonight. There are cowboys and Indians too! Don't miss it! Run! Yeni Sabah, Vatan, Cumhuriyet, Hürriyet! Yeni Sabah, Vatan, Cumhuriyet, Hürriyet! I came to ask if there is any news. Alleluia. I think you were sleeping. I'll come later. You should sleep. What sleep? Today is the third day. We have no news. I sit up all night when my husband doesn't come at night. While trying to calm his anger, I forget that my daughter disappeared. We've had enough. Matter of honor is not like anything else. You must call the police to find the girl. You were at ease since Nesibe was working at Beyoğlu. She was looking fine. She was obviously making good money. You bought a sewing machine recently, didn't you? She wasn't making that much money. Recep Efendi also asked for a raise from the place where he was working. Oh, really? Neighbours are talking about that Recep Efendi is always in the cafe, wondering if he is unemployed. They are probably talking about a few pennies we saved up. For sure. For sure. Nesibe is so young. She wouldn't make that much money. But you should do something. If she met a few punks in Beyoğlu, they would rip her to bits and they wouldn't even give an account. I stopped by her workplace in the morning, girls were surprised. She was very happy on Saturday. It was Sunday evening when she left. And today is Tuesday. My dear. She thought it was easier to be with strangers than with us. Going to the police is hard. Recep Efendi never went to the police station in his life. It would hurt his pride. My heart sinks. He doesn't ask about her. He acts as if Nesibe was never born. He doesn't ask about her. Don't think bad things. She is probably with a relative of yours. Don't you have any relatives? Not exactly. We fell out years ago. Now we are all apart. How are you auntie? Did you get any news? Oh, dear Ayşe. Unfortunately, we didn't. I should go, farewell. Maybe she shows up, I hope so. I always say, girls should be married when they get their period. Otherwise, they get into hot water. - Brother, give me that. - No. - Give me. - That's mine. - Please, give me. - No. - Give me. - No way. The photos are not alike, are they? This is from when Nesibe was in her last year at primary school. This is the last photo of her that I found and printed because my neighbor said give it to the newspaper. They must have darkened her lips. Otherwise, you know, she wouldn't paint her lips. Does the photo look like her, please tell me. It does. Other than the lips, it does look like her. You pushed her buttons before you could learn to tolerate her. She had her reasons. She is a good girl. She is. Look how happy she was. Just as happy as when she was telling the movies. When I came here as a bride four, five years ago, she was just a little girl. Out of spite, she stood on the stony ground all day long. I was astonished. Dear Nesibe, how are you? Come on Nesibe, don't be stubborn. Come on in. It's getting chilly. The summer cinema will probably close as well. Look, it's not sunny. They're also removing chairs as you saw. Yes, they're. Let's go to the pier. We'll look at the boats. What will we do there? We've already looked at the boats. - Nothing. We'll have fun. Come on. - Wait, I'm coming. Look, he's drinking. Let me show you The Cibali Tobacco Factory. Why? Show it from here. It looks better from inside the pier. When I grow up, I will work there like my sister Firdevs. Really? Like sister Firdevs? Are you really going to work there like sister Firdevs? Yes, really. I will have so much fun. I will take the ferry in the morning and the evening. You will really have so much fun. You two inseparable chums! Looks like you got the permission again. Here you go! I watched Baytekin yesterday guys, it was very good. MOULIN ROUGE THE BLUE ROSE DOUBLE INDEMNITY CAMILLE LADY GANGSTER THE LOVER COLORFUL JUDY GARLAND NIAGARA DIRTY WOMEN LOST HOPES How are you? Is everything okay? - I forgot my keys, sister Ayşe. - Come in, my dear. I'm sorry, sister Ayşe. I keep forgetting my keys. I'm glad you came. Well, sit down. My mother is right saying that I'm goofy. I was getting bored anyway. We can chat while my naughty kids sleep. Let me have a look at them. Okay, they're asleep. How about some coffee? You're almost a grown up. Come on, drink your coffee before it gets cold. It's like a graveyard around here, my sister. I feel sorry for my mom and dad too. They didn't have a moment of peace. You should see the women who come to the shop, they all look like monkeys. If they had your hair and beauty, they would go crazy. They spend money like water to become beautiful. Some days I get so bored. Do you think Atike did better by working at the tobacconist? What do you want, dear mother? Could I get you some water? I don't know what you want. Did I make noise and wake her up? No, dear. She can't hear for the last fifteen days. And she doesn't recognize anyone anymore. She even thinks my husband, her son, is a stranger. Come on dear, why are you getting bored? You said that you loved it there. You were saying that it's huge and it's like a fair ground. Did you change your mind dear Nesibe? You're right. Let me tell you the last movie I've seen. Maybe I can cheer you up, dear sister. You crazy girl! My lovely girl. I really love movies, my sister. The movies I've seen are so beautiful that I think I'm in a dream. Songs, music, colors... There was a very beautiful female star in the movie I went to. Her hair was very blond. A man loved her very much. They were staying at the hotel next to a large waterfall. The waterfall is in America. The beautiful woman was singing a song. Look, I even memorized it. ♪ Kiss, kiss me in your arms ♪ ♪ Kiss me once again ♪ At this rate, I'll learn English. I also went to that movie once with the girls. The woman gets on the bus and goes far away. She gets on the bus and comes back. She loves the young man, not the old man who loves her very much. The way she is walking out the door... The hotel looks like home. - Sister Ayşe. - Yes. Let's go to the movies together one day. We leave the children to my mother. She does not go to the Grand Bazaar every day. - Okay. - Yes why not! Let me tell you another movie, my sister. A rich earl falls in love with a poor girl. The man lives in a very large palace. The palace has huge doors. Doors open one after another. One last door opens and the door leads into the ballroom. People are dancing. They are dancing a waltz and they are spinning. They are spinning and spinning, and spinning. The women are so beautiful. How in the hell did she leave? How? She is a good girl. Brother Recep should calm his anger. I recall that whenever she was happy, she got roses in her cheeks. She's so young. I can't blame her. We have been in this house for five years. Always the same difficulties. Our days are dwindling down. Nesibe is a good girl. She is. She was honorable. The things she aspires to are so far from us. We couldn't teach her to appreciate what she has. My boys have probably started misbehaving. They don't listen to me. They are exhausting me. If you need anything please let me know, auntie. My dear Ayşe. God bless you. I said, don't scream! Don't! Shut up! - Everybody can hear. - Will I not be able to go anywhere? From seven in the morning to seven in the evening I'm run off my feet! I'm grown now. You don't know anything about the world. See how others live. You just want me to watch while everyone else is having fun. Shut up! Thank God that uncle Aslan did not go to your father. He saw you at the pier with a sailor. He said he felt embarrassed in front of his stallholder fellows. - Shut up! - Why do I have to shut up? I said shut up! Shut up. Aren't you ashamed? If your father had been at home when Uncle Aslan came and heard what you were doing he would have killed you. He is not my uncle. He is my step-aunt's husband. I'm not a kid. I said it wasn't me he saw. Look who's talking, the drunken liar. He gives his wife a few pennies and spends the rest on booze. Don't make me beat you up. Do you think they will marry you? My stupid girl, they just mess with you. I was just dying for it! They aren't a patch on me. Who the hell are they? Damn those goody two-shoes. Your father is looking for a job again. He went to Cibali and still hasn't come. He will shoot you, stab you, kill you. I pray he doesn't hear about all this. We are poor but we are honorable. We used to have good days too. If I die, I die. I've lived enough. Don't start on me with your 'good days' stories. I've had enough. We are honorable people. Mother. My mother. Honorable, huh? My weekly wage keeps increasing. You don't ask about it. You beat me for wandering with someone my age. We didn't do anything bad. But you're trying to tell my father. You bought the Singer sewing machine. Who will pay the installments? Any girl in the store can do what I do. Why would they always increase my weekly wage? Shut up! You're going to be the death of me! So you've been lying. Weren't you making that much money from work? Is it so easy to make money? You know we are poor, that's why you think so. You know that I've been wandering around with old men. What? It's a problem only if they're young. Shut up! Or else I'll tear you apart. Shut up! Your father will be home soon. He should not hear this. How aren't you ashamed of yourself? Shut up! You already knew, Mother. You already did. Shut up. No mother would shut her eyes to such a thing. - Shut up. - But we are poor. ♪ I don't have a penny to bless myself with ♪ ♪ I only loved you this much ♪ Come and take a swim. - It's so hot. - No. I won't swim. You should at least sit on the shore. You'll have a good appetite. Then you'll have a delicious meal. ♪ What I say is always true Listen to my words ♪ ♪ If you don't believe Look into my eyes ♪ Welcome, my daughter. Welcome. I'm trying to finish tomorrow's work. I better go to the Grand Bazaar in the morning. The weather is so hot. And no wind at all. Come here to me. Come to me. What happened, are you upset? Come on. Who knows how tired you are today, mother? Eat something if you're hungry. Would you like a bath? So you're bathing yourself. Do you want me to soap your back? My lovely daughter. So you're grown now. My daughter is grown. My dear Nesibe. I wish your father would get a good job so I could prepare your trousseau. I will fast for the three months this year. I'll make a vow to begin to enjoy prosperity. I warmed the water my daughter, let me take your dress. Give me, my beautiful daughter. Mother, I'm coming. Come, my daughter. Nobody's here. Come on. Your hair is dry, my dear Nesibe. You can towel your ears, okay? My dear. You are still talking. Shut up. Or it'll get worse. Haven't you slapped me enough? Back off, Mother. There's so much more I can't say. He said “I will always wait for you.” Where will he wait? We can make it, don't worry. If we go like this, we won't make it. - Welcome. - Thank you. - Yes, can I help you? - I'm looking for a red button. - That one. - Wait for a second. We have this and this, miss. When I open shop in the morning at least you two come on time. We won't be late ma'am, don't worry. I'm saying that they are young. They don't understand. I couldn't see the beautiful girl. Is she off today or is she running late? Sir, they are making decisions among themselves. Youth, you see. - I like this one. - How many do you want? - I want 8 of these. - All right, miss. I'll have it ready. - Thank you. - How are you? - I'm fine. - Here, miss. - What happened? - We'll talk later. - All right. See you. - See you. I'm on duty next Saturday. Thank you ma'am. - Have a nice weekend. - Goodbye. I'll pick up the buttons. - Are the belt orders ready? - They are. - Did you wait long? - It's okay. Every time I try to get off work, they show me a new job. It's not a problem. I can wait for you for days, months. Mimosas. The harbingers of summer, mimosas. Man, get out. They get mad at me because of you. Don't take the bread out of my mouth, man. I can't believe what you said recently. Will you really go to Africa when you become a captain? Of course. Our business is on the open seas. Will you go to Egypt, to that noseless statue, too? Of course. We can even go to America. I'm most curious about Africa and Egypt. I watched two movies in the cinema. They were very exciting. There were steaming forests and wild tigers. Those who entered the tombs of the mummies fell under irreparable spells. Did I tell you that I really love cinema? You walk in and the movie starts. Everything is beautiful like a dream. Isn't it? Otherwise, cinema wouldn't be lovable. Now let's see what we will eat. Excuse me? What would you like? Where are you lost? Are you upset about something? What are you thinking? Nothing. I am not thinking of anything. - What did you ask? - I asked what would you like? - I guess you didn't hear me. - I didn't. Mimosas, mimosas, mimosas. Mimosas. The harbingers of spring, mimosas. Mimosas. The harbingers of spring, mimosas. - Mimosas. - Would you like strawberry? - No. What did you order? - Ice cream pudding. - I want that too. - Ice cream pudding. There is something upsetting you. I want you to tell me. No, there isn't. I am not upset. - I just spaced out for a second. - Don't do that. - It's okay now. - Really? - Yes. - All right. Our ice creams have arrived. Thank you. - Do you like it? - Yes. - Here they are. - Hello. Hi. - Hello. - Welcome. - Hi. - Thank you. - Welcome. - Hello. - Welcome. - Thank you. Would you like an ice cream cone? HOTEL IMPERIAL - You know this place very well. - Of course, I do. - I was born in Istanbul, I'm from here. - Where do you reside? We live a little down Tepebaşı. So your house is not far from work. Yes. If my house was far from my work, my family wouldn't allow me to work. I'm working because I get bored. Poplar, cypress, chestnut, white poplar, black oak, hornbeam, plane, pine. Lime, beech, nut pine, hack berry, magnolia. What are you saying? What a surprising girl you are! Do you know the name of all the trees? I don't know the name of this tree. Do you know? I don't know much about trees. We learn about ships and what is needed for the cavalry of the far seas. My nanny would know it right away. She taught me all the trees. She is not here anymore. And I don't know this tree. Do you want to find it a name? Come on. Let's find it a name together. We can do it. Let's find it. This tree looks most like to foremast. Let's call it foremast tree. What do you say? Don't you like it? Don't you like the name I find for the tree? Don't you? I like it. May I kiss you? Please take me seriously, okay? I love you more and more. - Is that you? - Are you sleepy? - Of course it is me. - Well, just a slip of the tongue. Any news? What about the job in Cibali? They already found someone else. I told you, you can't work there on Sunday. You are talking nonsense. Do you think it makes sense for a man to take a Sunday holiday? You should eat something. They want me in the marketplace on Monday, I'll go there. - Tomorrow? - No. Next Monday. Did the girl go to bed early without eating? She reads novels on Sunday nights. Or has she given up on being a bookworm? I know exactly what to do to her. Please for God's sake. Don't do anything bad, swear on me. I said shut up. Sit down. Get up. I have something to say to you. I said get up. Don't dawdle. Hurry up or I will get you here. Recep Efendi, don't go too far, please. Just talk to her. And tell her not to talk back to me. That's all. You came home late yesterday, did you? I'm asking you, didn't you hear me? Answer me. I heard that you jumped on your mother and you didn't say where you were. Don't you know how to speak? When she was only seven years old, she stood on the ground in the house on the hill all day and we couldn't get a word out of her. She drives me crazy with her stubbornness. I'm asking you, didn't you hear? Answer me! Recep Efendi, stop. Don't, Recep Efendi! I told you answer me! Answer me! Get up! Tell me where were you yesterday or I will kill you! Tell me where were you or I will kill you! Tell me! Don't, Recep Efendi! You're going to kill her! Don't! Get away from me! Get up! Get up! Tell me! Come on, come on! Tell me! Where were you? - Where were you? - Don't, I said don't, please. - Don't hit. - I told you get away! Get away, woman! Don't make me beat you too after all these years! Don't make me! I wish we hadn't come here. I wish we had a garden. How did we become like this no matter how hard we try? Let go of my daughter, Recep Efendi. She's fragile like a bird. Forget about your home and garden dreams! You don't deserve anything but these rooms. Goddamn you both! I'm fed up! I'm fed up! She's fragile like a bird. I just wanted you to talk to her. I shouldn't have said do it. My baby almost died. Then let her die. Then let her die. Then let her die. I wish she never grew up. I wish she had died earlier and never grew up. Only whores and thieves are lucky in this life. Only whores and thieves are lucky in this life. RIZA PASTRY, CAKE, BAGEL SELLER CAPTAIN BLOOD I didn't know. He loves us. As the years pass I will make vows. It will pass. It will all pass. It will all pass. Don't touch me. I didn't tell him to hit you, my dear Nesibe. I said "Don't hit me dad". Didn't he hear me? You didn't say anything. You didn't say a word. Even if you said it, he didn't hear it. He was furious. Please don't lie to us, my daughter. You are the liars. Green courtyard houses, good days. You are the liars. At your age! - I'm going to sleep. - Let me put bread on your cheek. Let it rot. I don't want it. I'm going to sleep. Nesibe. I... I can't take it anymore, my daughter. I'm human, too. Enjoy the grills. Enjoy the grills. Enjoy the grills.
