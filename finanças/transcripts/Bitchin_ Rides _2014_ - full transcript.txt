[ fwoosh ] dave: We're rebuilding a c10 from our past, and our new client wants to drive this thing really hard. Awesome. Who doesn't like c10s? It's like the coolest pick-up ever. Dave: I'm super excited to get this project rolling again. Dave: What is that machine? Kevin: This looks like one of those motion rides. [ laughs, retches ] it should fit right up. This is gonna be close. Hell, yeah, I do. Get you one nugget. Mm! Want another one? I feel like this is a trick question. Bryce: You start seeing these little bubbles and it's just completely rusted underneath of it. I've seen better. You make it sound easy, like, oh, yeah, we just bring a car in, we do everything in one place, and we give it back to you. Yeah, that's but this is we're supposed to make it sound easy. Oh, boy. The truth. Okay, say it again. -Just give me a bitchin' truck. Dave: Clean... Custom... Bitchin'. ♪ my name is dave kindig. Designing and building custom cars is my life's passion. With the best mechanics, technicians, and fabricators in the business, quality is our only focus. We build bitchin' rides. ♪ eric: It's a little chilly this morning. Kind of get an idea of what we've got going on here, dave: So this c10 truck's actually been kicking around the shop for quite some time. A good old friend of ours, we met many, many years ago, chuck, had to start to build this truck. We had a full custom chassis underneath it and basically it just kind of fell to the wayside. Chuck had some reasons that he needed to stop on the project and we just never got going on it again. I haven't really worked on this truck. I don't really know a whole lot about it. Looks like some someone here in the shop had worked on it back in the day and it needs to be finished up. Dave: So this c10 truck has been taking up space for years in the shop and we really want to finish it. So enter dave maxwell and his brother bobby. They really want this thing finished up and they're stoked to see what I can do with it. Gonna pull it apart, who knows what that entails. I do want to take apart the least amount as possible. ♪ right on. Kevin: I am super happy to get going on this c10 again. We were so close, and I'm really excited to see what the new owner expects out of this build. The first time around we took it, we did some really cool custom mods, we chopped it a little bit, we did some window work, did a really cool exhaust. I wasn't super happy with the chassis that was under there, but it was customer supplied, so we were running with it. It's been six years since we touched this build, and there's definitely some areas of concern that we're going to have to address. This is exactly why we have eric digging into this truck to see if there's some major problems. Here's the fun part about taking apart a custom cars, is you don't know where any of the hardware is supposed to be or what's holding it together, most time we try to hide everything. So when it's the first time coming back apart, kind of a mystery. We play, where's that bolt? Kevin: So tearing down this c10's going to be a little bit different. We've obviously modified a lot of stuff on this thing. We need to tear it down and we just need to pay close attention that we don't have any outdated parts or better ideas for a couple of things. [ grunts ] I might have to pull the headers off to get this guy out. ♪ maybe this other one will come out. Dave: The truck really didn't have a lot to do, and it's finishing up and it shouldn't be long before it goes over to the body shop. I'm still convinced this one can come out without me pulling the headers. But I may be wrong. ♪ can't get it. At this point, removing the headers isn't that big of a deal, but eric has a great point. You don't want to have to pull these headers out once everything is all painted and complete to get these panels out. So we're going to have to make a tweak. Eric: Yeah, looks like this is intended to be cut out. So we'll be able to remove these inner fenders without having the exhaust off and on. So we'll remember that. Wiggle it out if you have it just in the perfect twist and movement. [ grunts ] I'm just going to pull the headers. Just gonna do it. This is great though, my hands aren't getting filthy or nothing this is the best disassembly ever. Yeah, so this c10 looks pretty trick, looks like a lot of work's been done to it. And I'm looking forward to getting this thing buttoned up and out of here. Chassis looks a little questionable, but let's see what dave is going to talk to the client into, because this thing has a lot of potential. Maybe it's more than just that. [ metal creaks ] so far, there's only a few minor things that just need to get trimmed up and we should be good to go. ♪ ♪ sheesh! Dave: And now that we're going to go full throttle back into this project, it's time for me to contact the guys that own it and find out what they want to do. Hey, bobby, how are you? I'm doing great, dave. How are you doing out there? I'm doing fantastic. Thank you. I hope you guys are staying healthy and warm. Oh, we're staying healthy. It was a little bit too warm the last few days. Well, hey, listen, I wanted to give you a call, dave. I guess he's a little tied up, so that's great. I get to talk to you at least. At least I want to talk to you guys about the c10 and kind of get a game plan of what we want to do with it. Alright. A little bit about that truck. So it's got a lot of stuff that's already been done. The hood's been stretched all the way to the windshield and we have about a two inch chop, a lot of really cool custom touches. And of course, the chassis has been upgraded as well as the stock chassis. It's boxed and it has like c4 corvette suspension, independent full front and rear, ls2 and an automatic. So are you guys wanting to kind of stay that same way or what do you guys want to do with the truck? Well, let's go to the engine. Okay. I'm going to want to have some more horsepower. I don't blame you. The motor that's in there right now just has the stock intake. And so it seems like it's really low down in the engine bay. It'd be nice to get something with a little bit more height to the intake. So whether it's a heat stack injection or something like that, maybe we do some really cool fuel injection or some sort? The suspension you say it's a box suspension? Yeah. So it's the stock chassis from the original c10 and then they've boxed it and then it's got c4 corvette suspension both front and rear. My honest opinion, depending on how much you guys are going to drive it, it might be better to maybe do a different chassis. This one will work, it's nice, but I think they made a lot of improvements on on chassis since we started building this thing so long ago. Yeah, well, I know our our goal is we're going to show this truck. So but after the show, we're going to want to drive it and drive it like a truck should be driven so -- hard. How about changing that chassis out for us, and what do you suggest? You know, honestly, I'm a big fan of the stance with the roadster shop, and they've gone independent. And since that truck's already been built with enough room for an independent suspension, maybe we just go back to doing something like that. It should bolt right back on. Well, the roadster shop sounds great. Heard a lot of good about them. I think a little bit more horsepower. You're probably gonna want a better chassis anyway, and that one definitely will do it. So I'm just making a couple of notes here. What kind of colors are you guys thinking you'd like to do on this truck? Well, dave, the maxmotive colors are black, red, white, that'd be awesome. Sure. Because you guys are going to kind of use that as kind of a promotional vehicle at the beginning of its life with you guys. And then you're going to drive it after that is kind of the plan? Yes, sir. Okay, perfect. Well, you know, that's my company colors, too, so that'll be really easy to get behind that and come up with some cool ideas. Maybe I'm just kind of spitballing right now, but I'm thinking maybe do the outside black and white and do a red interior. I think that's just a wonderful combination. It'll look real natural for that truck. And maybe give us an idea, maybe a little bit of red pin stripe thrown in there. Sure. Or whatever you think. Yeah, sure. I think that'd be kind of cool looking. The inside of that truck has got a '59 impala dash as well, which is kind of cool. It's been grafted in, so maybe we'll play around a little bit with that too. Alright. That sounds awesome. I'm excited, dave. I can't wait to tell my brother about all this. Yeah, same here. You know, he's excited as well. Awesome, buddy. Well, cool. Let me put this together for you and dave and let you guys take a look at it and then let's, let's go from there. Alright, dave. Thank you so much. We're excited to work with you and your team out there. Right on. Well, right back at you guys. I'm very excited. I know you guys are car guys, and this is going to be a wonderful project together. So thank you. Alright. Thank you, dave. Alright, buddy. Bye. Bye. Bobby's right on the money with putting a new chassis under this will improve the stance and the quality of the ride. So right now, I got kevin looking up a custom chassis and I got jordan rocking out on some aluminum work. Jordan: This is the trim I machined up, just wanted a groove in it. Dave wanted it a little off set so it kind of resembles the old stock style trim. I just need to start shaping it to fit the body. It's going to be a little tricky to go in a few spots. We've got to got to go up and over the wheel wells and follow that body contour pretty close, so. I'll just anneal this just so it's easier to bend. It made a little jig fixture thing that I can bend it around, but we've got to wrap around the entire truck. So I'll anneal it and hopefully that'll make it easier for me. But we'll see. ♪ this process just softens the metal, so it's easier for me to bend it around the, around the jig there. So it'll curve this way and then around like that. But the really sharp part, I have no choice but to bend it while it's heated up. I wait for the plane to turn slightly orange and stop at that point. You don't want to go much further. That gets hit pretty soft and you can manipulate it pretty good after that. Put a little more pressure as I need kind of constant and I'm mostly letting the heat do the work. The hard part's just getting it to lay down exactly how you want it, so there's none of the springing action because it's just going to be held on with a double-sided tape. I think maybe a fastener or two on each end just to hold it in place as insurance, you know, but for the most part, it's going to be double-sided tape. So you want it to be able to relax on there.

This place is awesome. Jeremy, how are you, man? Great to see you, phil. -Josh. -Good to see you, man. Thanks for, thanks for inviting us out here, guys. You know, we've been doing a lot of stuff with you guys, but never had the opportunity to come and check out your facilities. -Pleasure to have you here. I'm excited. Appreciate you making the haul. Well, yeah. Well, we got a little bit of business to discuss, too. We needed to order a chassis. I think we can handle that. And the phones were all down in salt lake. -Josh, is your man. -Being at the roadster shop is like a dream come true. There's all these cool things going on. We were in the area for a show and I'm super excited to be here and check it out. Who knows? Maybe they're hiring. I brought the checkbook so we're gonna order a chassis. You can see whatever you want. I hope we just come home with the chassis that we need. I hope dave doesn't try to buy something dumb. Dave: Yeah, this is pretty cool in here. In the almost decade that we've been working on this truck, and wanting to get back on the truck, you know, it's funny how much technology changes and being at the roadster shop and seeing all the technical advances of these foundations of the "perfect" ride, well, it's pretty impressive. So you have a couple of different options on that. You have one with just a regular nine inch, you know, ford-styled axle, four-bar or triangulated, obviously independent front. I think we're probably a little bit more interested in doing an independent front and rear. Oh, fast track irs. Yeah, I think so. Gonna push on this thing a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. If you want the best, that's really the way to go. The fast track irs? It's absolutely the best performing chassis. So the fast track chassis that the roadster shop offers is their top-of-the-line chassis. It has irs, it has ifs. This thing is dialed from front to back. Man: This chassis it's been through a lot of different generations. It's just gotten better and better and better. Trying to fine tune all those customer requirements, make it as easy as possible for the install and just trying to get every corner and every little expectation fixed so that we have a solution for someone. If they need something actually figured out for it. -That's awesome. -Right. When you have to design the frames or the chances that you never have before. What's the craziest thing you've come across or or one of the hardest problems that you had to get through? Generally, the rule of thumb is the customer wants it as low as possible. The biggest wheels and tires possible, the biggest engine possible, the biggest transmission possible with the least amount of modifications possible so that everything gets big, everything goes down, low motor comes up and then nobody wants to modify it. So a couple of hours could we just wait for it? -Sure. -Totally. Is there a place to get a burger around here? Well, cool, let's get a c10 ordered, huh? Let's do it. I'm going to stay here and actually work on the frame rails. Are you really? Ah, you traitor. How come every time I take you on a field trip you want to stay there and work? Oh, it's fun. Seeing all the r&d that goes into these chassis is cool, but they're more than just a chassis place. Dave: So this is all of the fabrication area. Basically, we're putting the cars -- for all the car builds side. Yeah. And you guys are doing a ton of those survivor series. So that's basically just, take the car the way it sits, put it on a brand-new chassis and a new engine drive train, and then the outside stays the same and then you can just rally it. Yeah, just just drive it. It's a full build minus paint body, chrome, and glass. Get in the car, tear it up. I'm all about that. But there's something I'm just a little bit more excited about. Josh: We have chassis storage or chassis purgatory. ♪ what you working with? ♪ ♪ couple racks up on the fit ♪ ♪ giovanni's on the whip ♪ ♪ girl, you're man-ing ♪ ♪ what you working with? ♪ kevin: I'm beyond excited right now. This right here has made this whole trip worth it. Oh, look at all these chassis. This is a chassis' -- chassis, chassis, chassis upon chassis. I think you should say it a little slower. Chassis. Once again. There's way more chassis here than I've ever seen in one spot. [ laughter ] for those of you that forgot, chassis are kind of my thing. -Chassis needs to come back. -Chassis. -Right about, maybe there-ish? -Chassis. -I'm under the four link -chassis. Chassis. That's one class of chassis. A lot of class and chassis. [ laughter ] it's like I'm in heaven, roadster shop has been building award-winning, great-handling chassis ever since I can remember. And I've been wanting to see how they do their process. Josh: Alright, so we're at the beginning of the chassis fabrication process. Raw material comes in flat plate or box tubing. Comes in this side, goes out the other side as finished chassis. Kevin: So amazing, like I said. So you're looking at all of this stuff right here. You're looking at somebody's future chassis is sitting right here on this floor right in front of you, whether it's here or here, you know, one of these parts, somebody is going to be riding on some of this material. I mean, it's just insane to think about. What is that machine? Wow. Kevin: We're in illinois at the roadster shop to pick out our new chassis for a c10 build. Dave: What is that machine? That is our fiber laser for our flat plate and our tube. So we cut all the spec rails as well as fast track and revo frame rails and basically any other piece of metal that needs to be cut is done on this laser here. Wow. How many sheets does it take for to, you know, for an average chassis. Can you get it all out of one or is it two or four. You can pretty much do everything out of one. Wow. So one sheet gets you all the components for the most part for a pro chassis. You make it sound easy, like, oh yeah, we just bring a car in, we do everything in one place, and we give it back to you. Yeah. That's what we're supposed to make it sound easy. And we always say everything starts with a good foundation. Obviously, that is the very beginning of a good foundation. You know what this reminds me of? This is like one of those motion rides. [ laughs, retches ] I'm sure you could get in. Oh, I don't know. I don't think that'll, I don't think that'll end well. Like they used to say on "cribs," this is where the magic happens. This is where all the magic happens, baby. So it's two access, well then, actually, because you're doing radial stuff but it spins the pipe right? Spins the pipe, correct. Dave: This magical massive metal-cutting microwave is a game changer, I wish I had one. The bed lifts up and that one rolls underneath it and then he -- and then this one will come forward and drop down. Do you want to shut the door and start you can cut a chassis. Yes, I do, that's awesome. Uh, you got to shut the door. No, no. I want to watch. [ laughter ] so it'll just run through that whole thing, optimize all of the material as much as it can. So I pre-nested everything and right now you can see where the head's at. And this is all the frame rails, all the suspension components already preexisting, and now they're all going to be cut in order. So the heat in the sheet gets diminished throughout the whole entire sheet. Oh, wow. So that's something that I would not have even thought about until I had a sheet in a machine, that's all rolled back. Yeah. And this will take about how long to cut this, chassis? Roughly about an hour per chassis. So, yeah, so it's not terribly time consuming. Where would we put something like that if we needed one? I'm just saying, if we needed one. We don't need one, we have the roadster shop. That's true. That is super, super cool. Let's take a look at the frame rail shop. Yeah, let's check that out. That's amazing. Chassis. -Alright. -And here we have the frame rail shop. We've got a set of frame rails jigged up. Basically the lasers cut four pieces, weld everything up, grind everything down flat, put a nice chamfer on the corners, and then you have a fabricated frame rail. So you have a lot of these frame rail jigs then, because you're making a lot of different chassis. A lot of frame rail jigs. So, when he's at this station, how many frame rails of the same thing will he do before he swaps out or just whatever? He'll do a couple of styles of frame rails and just swap jigs. And each guy will do the same thing. Wow. Kevin: This place is unbelievable. It may be me, but I'm getting a little moved here. There's a craftsman that sits in this room and welds these and these frame rails could end up under who knows car? -One of your cars. You never know. That's amazing to me. That might be one of ours right there. That's awesome. -Very cool. -They're the artist for sure. So we've seen the frame rail shop. We obviously saw the laser as things come out of the laser, they split everything, frame-rails related, goes to the frame rail shop. Small parts go to the far right side. Down the middle, all the chassis fabricators are grabbing frame rails and small parts for that individual order jigging that specific chassis, whether it be a c10, a chevelle, corvette, mustang, whatever it is, they all have specific jigs. Then they're welding those up in that jig and completing that chassis. -Wow. How many jig's do you guys have for a full frame? The good thing about a jig is you can have a chassis on each side so each jig can actually do two chassis. Total we have about 25, I think, jigs. We have over 110 applications. -Wow. -That might be a lot of jigs. That is you do have to get real jiggy with it. Okay, I'm coming up to come up to this point. Well you didn't get that. I heard you. But don't laugh at your jokes anymore. I got to put up with? Um, are you guys hiring over here? No, I'm kidding. Well, josh, this has been really, really cool to be able to see how this process works. That's awesome. I mean, a lot of technical information. We got to get a place in order. I got a really itchy pen. There's so many choices now. This is an amazing operation you guys got here. Now that we've got the chassis all spec'd out and on the build sheet, it's time to get back to the shop and see what else we're doing. [ bird chirps ] ♪ so today, I'm going through and redesigning the chevy truck for the maxwells. Now, this truck's been around the shop for quite some time. If you've seen in the past, it's always been sitting up on the shelf basically in the assembly area, not touched for almost a decade. Back when we were building this for chuck, we're going to do some cool stuff, like a blue and white two-tone with a '59 impala dash and had the super cheyenne styled wood grain inserts for the trim. So pretty clean truck. Really nice. Really loved the exhaust we had come up with. But the truck went on hold for quite some time and it was time to move on. With the new owners, the maxwells, we're going to do up some different stuff. We want to do basically a red interior, black and white exterior, cool company colors, I'd have to say, because they happen to be the same as mine. And really, we're not making a whole lot of changes other than a couple of changes on the front fascia. I'm going to put a lower scoop in there, kind of chrome it out, give it a little bit of a nice flair. Changing up the wheels and actually on the trim, we're going to do a red line insert to match the red line tires and really kind of pull in that red detail. The engine will be red, of course. And I think it'll look really cool. ♪ ♪ ♪ dave: The new chassis is now back at the shop here and looking at that independent rear suspension is exactly what the doctor ordered.

So I'm really excited to get this body pulled off the old chassis and got on this one. There's tons of better handling. Obviously, it's got a rack and pinion it's got adjustable coilovers. This one has an independent rear. So it's going to give you a little bit more adjustability for the rear suspension, which is really important in trucks when you race trucks, trucks are light in the rear. So you want to be able to dial-in your suspension so you can get traction and grip in the corners, et cetera, et cetera. We're going to get the engine put in and we'll get the body put on and we'll be good to go. Sounds like we're just trying to get this body on that chassis over there. -Pull the wheels? -Yeah.

Because we always bring a car in and we have a plan, and then dave likes to change the plan sometimes and add stuff I'd really not to like to add things to this build, that'd be great.

We found a new client, started on the custom trim, and now the truck is sitting on the perfect new chassis. Now that all the big chunks have been taken care of on this c10, it's time to get to the fine details. Dave: So you got it on the new chassis. Everything fittin' pretty good there? That's all level down squared fits really nice for swapping chassis real quick. Didn't end up doing really anything. It's looking good. Nice, nice. Stock core support went back in place? Or the one that was on the truck. Yep, stock core support's in. I had an idea the other day because when I drew up this lower splitter and being in chrome, I still want to do it in chrome. I think it'll be a nice little accent. I kept thinking of what are these reveals, you know, the way that the grill surrounds are. So I want to kind of try and tie-in something in that has kind of that same, you know, detail to it, just on the front leading edge. So, of course, this air dam is functional. The idea behind it is just a front row pan, but I didn't want it just smooth, I wanted to try and incorporate a little bit the shape of the grille surround openings. That trim has a little bit of a reveal, so we added that on the front-leading edge. I-I'm kind of just thinking, really, just as simple as have it come out flat spot. Forty five, another little step, and then just have a nice arch to it. And it will just bring it to a peak. Kinda same shape as the grille? Just bigger and down low? Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Just something kind of ties in so it has a little bit of that step look like the openings, everything looking okay on the interior? We're thinking we have to cut the tranny tunnel up, raise it up a little bit get more clearance. But we're waiting 'til we get the motor before we -- because I'd love to not two but I think we're gonna have to. Yeah, well, I know that that transmission's going to be quite a bit bigger, but I'm going to -- we're going to design a steering wheel and do tiptronic kind of like what we did on the mercedes. Okay, that'd be cool. I think that'll be really cool in here, something a little bit different from everybody else. And of course, with a '59 impala dash, it's already going to be different. I like it a lot. Yeah. So bed all working out good? Yeah. So back here, that trim is going to come across, you know, just right at this body line comes around the corner and we've got that obviously have a little jog to get back into that rope-pan area. But I think if we raise that taillight bottom up, 'til we maybe maybe have about half an inch of painted surface between the chrome trim to separate the two tone. And then, let's just, let's take that little leg out right here and we'll just make our -- we'll just machine our own, you know, housing, hidden hardware, one piece lens. I don't want to reverse light in there. I don't care for a reverse light. That'll look really good. This is gonna be a bitchin' truck. Kind of wish I'd bought it myself. I just like building them. See, I actually I'm okay with that part too, because I still get to build it and I'll probably get to borrow it a couple of times... Before it goes? Yeah. But I think dave's going to have a great time with this truck, so. Yeah, he's gonna love it. If not, I'll take it off his hands. Right? I'll put you on the list. Yeah. Right behind you. Yeah, exactly. Thanks. Looks good. Thanks, dave. ♪ I got the plans, the blueprint and the drawing from dave, so we're going to get right into this project. I got four guys and we're going hot and heavy on it. Jordan's still doing his magic with the aluminum trim. Making it perfect for this truck. Izzy's building the buckets for the taillight and then greg's going to do all the cnc trimwork around the taillights and make a really awesome-looking bitchin' piece. And then daniel, I got him building the front lower ram air chin spoiler, not sure we've had it called ten different things. But I was going to be down where the grille's at. So he's going to make it look awesome. Just gotta do some layouts and kind of get this profile down the side? It's kind of going to be the look of a bumper. So that's why we're putting this little detail in it so it can kind of have a step to it, like the stock one would. But it's actually like a chin spoiler. I got to break it, but the top has a slight radius to it. So rather than it just being a straight piece and then a curve, it's going to be rounded into it. So this is just going to put a tiny little contour in it you can't really tell when I do it, but when it's on the truck, you'll see it roll rather than just a flat plane. ♪ ♪ I just got to put a bead roll in to get that that beauty line that I'm putting in in the front side. Yeah, it makes it a hell of a lot stronger, but it turns out that it's pretty, too. So first one's a 90 and then the next one just kind of take it as far as it can go. Well, the next one's a tricky one, we've got to roll it right here, clamp over it, and I'll just bend it by hand. I got both sides done, match pretty good. I welded them together and now we fit the truck pretty good, that's centered well, so now I got to just round the corners to make it look like it finishes somewhere. ♪ ♪ dave: The aluminum trim that jordan's building right now is two-fold, we wanted some chrome on the truck and I need something to separate that two-tone paint job. Sometimes you have to twist it and it's hard to... Hard to know exactly where to smack it, to give it the twist you want, you know. Good enough to test fit it. ♪ I'll tack 'em together and then test fir it a couple of times and then do fully weld it. Totally flawless, you know. Kevin: Jordan is what we like to call the trim whisperer. He can work, massage, shape, trim better than any man could even imagine. Jordan: I'm going to tap it in a tiny bit, get it to sit a little closer, most of it already bent. Looks like I need to bend that a touch to get this downhill a little. Tape it in place and get a better idea of what I need to do. Mostly there, though. ♪ eh, it's pretty decent. ♪ I got to shorten up the height of the taillights and then recess them into the bed. Try and get the top of the body line to match the top of the taillights, so they don't go past it. So we're getting rid of the factory reverse lights in it so they won't be there anymore. ♪ kevin: Once izzy has the buckets welded in, then greg can scan and start designing these custom taillight lenses. Oh, boy. So izzy got the taillight buckets pretty well figured out, it all looks great. So what I am doing is I'm going to make an aluminum trim ring and then a red taillight lens. I'm designing it on solidworks right now. I basically am making the part on the computer, but I need to tell the machine how to cut it out. I'm going to cnc the aluminum ring and then I'm also going to cnc red acrylic to make the taillight lens. That stuff is a little bit sensitive to scratches, so I think we're going to do a coating on the top. Going to be kind of trial by fire on this one. So greg is making the billet taillights for the c10. This is just like a prototype. Either you get it or you don't. So we're going to hope for the best in this process. Man, the program has no idea what it's doing. There's a lot of factors at play. Kevin: Cnc machine is a great addition to the shop, but when you're prototyping parts, you never know what's going to happen with the first one until you do it. Greg: Going to be kind of trial by fire on this one. So we just got these machines. This one's controlled by the computer. It's a lot of code. It's kind of the same way. As, like, making websites, you know. It's a lot of stuff that looks like a foreign language, but the machine just runs on some simple rules. It's just cartesian coordinates, runs on inches, x, y, and z. So your three dimensions. There's a lot of factors at play. ♪ I think it's going to look really cool with light coming through it. It looks pretty wild. Dave said, don't make these things too crazy. He wants them to look kind of stock. I tried not to make it look too tech-y. So now I just need to drill some holes in the bucket so that I can mount these things and then I'll screw it all together and hopefully it'll fit in the car without too much extra work. Should be should be pretty close. Well, the cncs are definitely a game changer, but old school is where it's at. We're going to hand shape all of these other details for this truck and make it flawless. ♪ dave: That's a nice piece, daniel. We've done rolled pans before here, we've done chrome bumpers, whatever, but I think this air dam kind of utilizing that same style cues the grille openings. I think that's gonna look pretty cool. Yeah, I think so. And not ugly like a diffuser. Right. But it's doing the same job. I mean, it's both form and function, really. We're going to get a lot more air passed up into the radiator and it's going to look good. Yep. The way this truck should've been built in the first place. Right. Okay, I'm just kidding. I agree. Well, I mean, yeah, this should have been. Yeah. ♪ jordan: I think I like it enough for now, just going to fine tune it later and get the groove totally smooth, but the shape is there it's what I'm after, so. -Wow. Jordan, dude. -You like? Yeah. Just like what I drew, man. -Yeah. -This looks awesome. I'll get it 99% done then let them finish body work. And if we need to tweak anything just a tiny bit we can come back and do that. Make sense. Yeah, I'm kind of thinking maybe across the interior kind of tight end. Maybe separate or bringing it into the door panels and stuff, too, so cool. No, I'll get let you get back to work. But yeah, it's looking awesome. This stuff's been tedious. I bet. Yeah. It doesn't bend as easily as the other stuff. No? No. I have to anneal everything. You know, they say, jordan, if it was easy, everybody would be doing it, then it wouldn't be cool, right? Yeah, I guess that's why I'm here. Yeah, you're super cool. Dave: This truck has gone from sitting on the shelf to the fast track of customizing. Once this part's wrapped up, we should be able to go over to body. Bryce: So I was pretty excited about this bill due to the fact that it was already body worked and already end primered, and so all we were going to need to do is get it over to the body side, sand it down, maybe put a final two primer on it and then block it, go straight to paint. But after finding what I think are some pretty big issues, you start seeing these little bubbles and then you start picking at 'em and it's just completely rusted underneath of it. Sections that the primer and bondo is just flaking off. And so being able to go over there and just scrape that away is not normal. You shouldn't see that. You know, my other concern, too, is this is a polyester primer and polyester has the tendency to be a porous material. If this was an epoxy primer would be a completely different story because that's like a moisture barrier. Well, as the polyester is just wants to absorb a lot of stuff that's out there. So six years of just sitting, that's that's a pretty big deal. And again, I think we just end up chasing problems if we're trying to just spot it in here and there. So in my personal opinion, this thing needs to get stripped back down the metal. And there's a crap ton of freaking body filler on this thing, too. [ ticking ] dave: Well, much like any kind of technology, body shop technology also improves and the fact that this has been done for so long, it's been open to the elements. We have a couple of areas that look like they're coming loose. To be honest with you, I don't want to chance that at all. It's better to send this thing up to strip, get it back in fresh metal and we'll start over. Kevin: It's not the end of the world. We're going to get the truck stripped and get it back into the metal shop. Man: Well, how's it look? Ah, look at that. ♪ I've seen better.
