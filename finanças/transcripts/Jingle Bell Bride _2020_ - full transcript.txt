RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Yes, no, I understand that the venue says their capacity is 300, but the fire marshal has it listed at 350. Yeah. I gotta call you back, okay? Hi! Hi, hi, hi! I'm so sorry. The caterer mixed up the location, one of the bridesmaids lost her hotel reservations, and I had to track down a cake topper with two turtle doves. Well, I'm just happy to be penciled into the busy schedule of Manhattan's premiere wedding planner to the stars. You have got the permanent ink, and two exclamation points. Before I forget... Kaylee insisted on making the invitations for the Christmas party. She told me, "Tia Jess says an elegant invitation is your first chance to make a good impression." She worked so hard on them. Smart kid. We are having the asado. No... La receta de la abuela? Of course! About the party... Jess... You promised. Mom and dad are flying in. Everyone is dying to see you. I know, I thought I'd be able to sneak away since Renee's wedding is in Manhattan, but I'm already running behind. I am this close to the London promotion. If I can deliver the perfect wedding for Renee, it's mine! We barely see you now, and you live in New York City. What's gonna happen when you're an ocean away? Well, there's... video chat, and email. Look, I know it's not ideal, but it's everything I've worked so hard for. You understand, right? We're just gonna miss you. There's always next Christmas. That's what you said last year. Duty calls? Yes, it's Renee's dress. She wanted a more traditional style, and I promised to drop it off. I hoped I had a little bit more time, but Renee lives all the way up in Scarsdale. - Tia Jess! - Hi! Mom's taking me to see the tree at Rockefeller Center. Can you come? I'm sorry, Kay, but take notes. I want to see your "A" game tomorrow when we do your tree, okay? See you tomorrow? I wouldn't miss it. Bye. Have fun! Is that it? Let me see, let me see! Oh, my goodness. I love it. It's exactly right. And the veil? There's been a delay. A delay? Nothing to worry about. Just a little mix-up. A mix-up is worse than a delay. We're taking care of it as we speak. I promise you. Okay. I'm glad you're here, because I want to talk to you about the bouquet. The florist is flying the miniature roses in from Ecuador. This particular breed grow on the side of a volcano. Very fragrant. I had a new thought. About the bouquet? Yes. The bouquet, and the boutonnieres, and I want to walk through an archway of flowers. My mother was going through some old pictures, and she found this. It's my grandmother. Are those amaryllis? Jingle Bell flowers. That's the name. Can you believe it? What could be more perfect for a Christmas wedding? My grandmother had one of these flowers pressed for years. When my mother got married, it was her "something borrowed". It would mean the world to me. Well, the wedding is less than two weeks away. I know. Thankfully we have time. Actually, that's not what I... Jessica? I put my complete trust in you to deliver the wedding of my dreams. I was assured you were the best. Anyone can get miniature roses flown in from the side of a volcano. I want these. The Jingle Bell flower? Yes. Rare and out of season. I called ten different florists, no one has them. I see, and what are we going to do about this? Well, I was thinking of suggesting a more practical compromise. Maybe chrysanthemums? There are a dozen event planners in the city that can do practical. Brides come to us because we can make their every whim a reality. Yes, but I can't give her a flower that doesn't exist. Renee's wedding is going to be on the cover of every magazine. Every talk show. We can't have our name attached to a disappointed bride. Jessica, do you know what I see when I look at you? A bit of yourself? No. I see potential. With commitment, you could go far in this business. You're still interested in the London assignment? Heading up our international office? Yes. Of course. So get me those flowers. I'd need them for Christmas Eve? Yes, this Christmas Eve. I didn't think it was that funny... Well, thank you for your time. Merry Christmas. Candy cane? It's a family recipe. Guaranteed to put a little happy in your holidays. Did you make those? Well, I was stuck at a patisserie at a cake-tasting for two hours, so I just decided to whip up a batch. I mean, you know what they say, idle hands are the devil's workshop. Anyway, I need your notes on the Carter-Rogers wedding. Barbara wants me to cover your consultation. She said you're dealing with a bit of a crisis? I wouldn't call it a crisis. A pickle? A fix? A jam? Nothing I can't handle. Well, if you're spread a little thin, I can always help with Renee's wedding. Lighten the load. Thank you, but I got it covered. If you change your mind... I'm just going to leave these here. Peppermint's really good for stress. Hi, this is Jessica Perez. I'm calling for Mayor Margaret Wilson? Thank you. Mayor Wilson? Have I got an opportunity for you. What about a new scarf? I could use one. Or a nice sweater. Aunt Mary, I'll love whatever you give me. Christmas shopping for you is always so difficult. Mayor Wilson! Here to check out this year's crop? Getting into the holiday spirit? It's for the flowers. They say music stimulates growth. Is that right? There is some research suggesting a link, but I think aunt Mary just loves singing along to her favorites. Here they are... the Jingle Bell flower. You two have really outdone yourselves. They're beautiful. Best we've ever had. Now you're buttering us up. Can't I compliment a job well done? Okay, I may need a tiny favor. Would we have enough to spare? Spare? I got a call from someone interested in purchasing them a wedding planner, and if we agree to make a few of our flowers available, she's promised to fully fund this year's music program. It's a chance to get the word out about our little festival. Really put us on the map. I... guess a few flowers won't hurt. Wonderful, and, Matt? I need a favor. Why can't we arrange for a courier? A courier couldn't assure the flowers would be here for the wedding. Tapeesa is in a remote part of Alaska, and limited flights in or out. What happens if you miss one of these limited flights? The wedding is in eight days. These flowers are too important to leave to chance... Plus I may have undersold how many we need. I'm hoping it'll be harder for them to say no once I'm there. 20 hours, round trip. I'll be back before you know it. Five minutes. Are you sure you can't stay a little longer? Dan can drive you to the airport. I know, I know, I just... I'm already cutting it too close. Kaylee's gonna be so disappointed. She wouldn't let us touch the tree decorations until you got here. I'll make it up to her. Here. In case we don't connect before Christmas. I haven't finished my Christmas shopping yet. Or started it. Not until Christmas. Okay. Thank you. Tia Jess! Merry Christmas, Kay! Can we start with the popcorn string? Mom says you're the only one that can make them so the popcorn doesn't fall off. I have to take a trip for work, so I can't stay. I'm sorry. It's okay. I understand. I know you'll do a fantastic job. You send me a picture when it's done? Yeah? Okay. Okay. Bye. - Safe trip. - Bye. Okay, shall we get started on the popcorn? - Yes. - Okay. Airport, please. You look a little lost. Hi. Yes, I am. I'm... I'm supposed to meet someone here. Which way to the terminal? There's no terminal. Baggage claim? Baggage claim, yes. Baggage claim right there. Welcome to Tapeesa. Take care! Tapeesa Mayor's office. Hi, I'm Jessica Perez. I'm meeting with Mayor Wilson, and she said she was sending a car over to pick me up at the airport. Can I place you on a brief hold while I check on this? Yes, of course. Excuse me? I am so sorry. I didn't mean to hit it. I-I... it got stuck. Please, all yours. Just steer clear of "D". Actually, I was... - Hello? - Yes, I'm here. - Yes? - Okay, right. Thank you for your patience. I just spoke with the Mayor, and your ride should be there. At Tapeesa airport? Yes. Well, I don't know what to tell you, because I'm standing in the middle of the only hangar in existence, and there is no one else h... You know, thank you for your help. I-I think I found him. Are you my ride? Matt Holden. My family grows the Jingle Bell flowers for the festival. Mayor Wilson asked me to make sure that you had everything that you needed. Yes. Good. Thank you. I'm so sorry about before. I guess I was just expecting someone, you know... - ...well, with a sign. - A sign? With my name on it? So they can find me at the gate. Right. Wouldn't want to miss you with all these people here. Right. Are those my cookies? Yeah, I mean, I did spring them free. We can share. Oh, no, I don't think so. Okay. Well, my truck is parked outside. Wait. Truck? I think your welcome sign has a typo. It says population 112. It is. People? Well, we certainly don't count the moose. Here we are. They're a lot smaller than I thought they'd be. You could always back out if you want. No hard feelings... No, no, no, no, no, no! I want them. Let's pack 'em up. Okay, well, they need to be individually clipped, wrapped, and hydrated. Okay, okay. I just need to be on a plane out of here in a little over an hour. Okay, well, we'd better get a move on. So, how many sprigs did you need, about seven? Seven? Like... "seven maids a-milking" seven? Like, "seven swans a-swimming". Is that not enough for a bouquet? No, it is. It is. It is. I just... I need enough for boutonnieres, and an archway. Not just the bouquet. Okay, well, Margaret didn't mention all of that. Well, the nature of negotiation. One starts low, the other one starts high. You meet in the middle. I traveled an awful long way, on a very small and shaky plane, because I need these flowers to dress a wedding. Well, it looks like you're in quite a bind. Look, my client has her heart set on these Jingle Bell flowers. She has this deep personal connection. They were in her grandparents' wedding, and I swore to her that I would do whatever it takes to make her dream a reality. Please. I really need your help. Okay. I think we can work something out. Yes! Perfect! You have no idea what a relief this is... You're not serious. I am. It's the nature of negotiation. Fantastic. Okay, so... Bouquet, boutonnieres, and centerpiece for the head table. And I really need that archway. Deal? I'll get those boxes. Oh, and... For you. What's that for? Well, if you want the flowers, you've gotta help. It's gorgeous. It's beautiful. You're talking. Yeah. The roads are in rough shape after the plows went through. I have to take it slow. I'm sorry if I've been a little... Pushy? I was going to say "brusque," but... I'm just, I've been under a lot of pressure. Do wedding planners typically travel thousands of miles for flowers? They do when it's for Renee. Who? The singer? Renee? "Too In Love to Leave"? "Christmas Bells for My Baby"? Nothing? Well... It's a big deal. Probably the biggest of my career. Everything needs to be perfect. Why did you stop? Popular moose crossing. Moose crossing? Yeah. I thought you were kidding... Never can be too careful. What's wrong? Nothing. Are we stuck? No, of course not. Just... Okay, yeah, we're stuck, but don't worry about it. Nothing I can't handle. Okay. You drive, I'll push. No, no, no, I can't let you do that. Why not? Well, because you're not dressed for it. Fine. You push. Why do I get the feeling like you'd drive off without me? Don't be ridiculous. I don't know the way to the airport from here. I'll count you off. Okay. One... two... three! I knew I should have pushed. It's really wedged in there, isn't it? Yeah. We're going to have to call someone for help. Okay, here, you can use my cell phone. Hey, Mr. Gregory! Can you give us a hand? Only take a minute. I thought I recognized your truck. Okay, I'll meet you... inside. I'm here. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry, you just missed the flight. What? No! How could I miss the flight if you're right here? Well, Tapeesa's small, it's not that small. We have two pilots. Of course you do, and when is your next flight to Anchorage? I can get you on one tomorrow. Tomorrow? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It is critical that I leave today. Well, I sure do apologize about the inconvenience, but I'm afraid you're gonna have to extend your stay. You're in luck, though. You're just in time for our annual Jingle Bell Flower festival! - Hey, Matt. - Hey. Hey, don't worry. Those flowers should hold up until you leave. That's not what I was worried about. Is there any way that you can give me a lift to the nearest hotel? What, there's no hotels? No. Sorry. Well, an inn? A lodge? B&B? Where do people stay when they come visit? With friends and family. Well, maybe they'll let me camp out at the airport. I guess you could just drop me off at the Mayor's office. She definitely won't be there. Where would she be? That sure is a stroke of bad luck. I hope this doesn't put you too far behind schedule. No, it... It's my own fault, really. I should have factored in the moose crossing. I'm sorry, I'm having a little trouble finding cell service. Is this a bad area? Reception can be finicky down in these parts. Comes and goes. How often would you say it goes... Jessica needs a place to stay tonight. Do you guys know anyone that might be able to help? Well, she can stay with us, of course. With us? I have an extra guest room. That's what it's there for. What about Amanda and them? They won't be here until tomorrow. I don't want to be any trouble. It's no trouble at all. Really? Thank you. I really appreciate it, and I'll be out of your hair in the morning. First flight out. Why don't you get her settled in? I gotta help out with the festival today. We have plenty of volunteers. Okay, I just gotta make a quick stop. Okay. Yeah, the cold can take a lot of people by surprise. I'm a New Yorker. I'm used to the cold. Well, there's New York cold, and then there's Alaska cold. I'm perfectly comfortable. When you get it home, you're gonna want to cut a few inches off the trunk. If you wanna keep it nice and green, then just put a little aspirin in the water. A little bit of sugar helps, too. Hey, thanks again for the help earlier on, Mr. Gregory. You know, I got stuck in the same place last week. Are you here for Aunt Mary's tree? Yes, sir. And, did she tag along with you? No, she's doing festival prep all day. I got one special for you. Actually... Marta will help you. All right, great. I'll stay right here. - Okay. - Yeah. So, is this your first time at a Jingle Bell Festival? Yes. Isa! First-timer! Hello! Hi! We have everything you need right here. An itinerary, a history of the festival, a map of Tapeesa... Don't forget about the tree lighting. I was getting to that. It's four whole days of events, but I've circled some of my personal favorites. Mr. Gregory loves the tree lighting, but I'm partial to the final night's dance. Thank you. No, no, that's... that won't be necessary. It's no trouble at all. Name? It's Jessica. Perez. I'm sorry, I really don't want to be a part of any mailing list or anything. It's for the draw. The draw. Every year, one lucky festival-goer is selected for Tapeesa's greatest honor... Jingle Bell Princess. That's... What, does she get a crown? No, it's a tiara! Of course it is. So, have you finished all your Christmas shopping? No. There's a Christmas marketplace in the square. I'll be running a booth there. Come say hello. Great! Well, thank you for all... this. I should... Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! How long have we been here? Here, the sun sets at 4:00. In the afternoon? When's sunrise, midnight? 10:00 a.m. How do you guys get anything done in the dark? Flashlights. Flashlights. Hey, room service. That's your carry-on? Yeah. I worked on the plane. No change of clothes? No... no pajamas? Toothbrush. Okay, my Aunt Mary might have something that you can borrow. I'll leave those here, and if you need anything else, I'm just in the guest house out back. Great. Thank you. All right... Hey. Lights are all rigged up, and the tree is ready to decorate. It's perfect. Last douglas fir from Mr. Gregory's farm. They was moving fast, so he set one aside for you... How thoughtful. ...and two wreaths. I think Mr. Gregory might be sweet on you. How's our guest settling in? She's been holed up in that guest room since she got here. Poor thing. What a bad stroke of luck. Yeah. I think if she could, she would walk back to New York. That reminds me... You got a letter. Second letter this month. They must be anxious to get you back. Yeah. I'm gonna go get those other wreaths. They're gonna look great on the back porch. I've got my laptop. I can work from here for the time being. Do you have any idea when you'll be able to leave? Tomorrow. I'll be on the next flight out. This is exactly what I was worried about, and now you're going to lose a whole day of preparation. The caterers are set. The dress is delivered. We've already done the walk-through with security. Everything is 100% under control. Oh no. Is everything all right? It's fine. I'm just going to have to call you... back. There she is! I was going to see if you needed anything, but I didn't want to disturb you. Well, I was wondering if you had a cell phone charger? I left mine in New York. I'm sorry. I don't have a cell phone. Around these parts, if you want to talk to someone, you just knock on the door. But if you need to make a call, you're free to use the landline whenever you need. Great. Thank you. This is a lot of fruitcake. I always make treats for the festival volunteers. Going on 40 years now. Really? When Matt was a little boy, he'd show up on my doorstep bright and early on the day I made fruitcakes. To give you a hand? And to sneak some of the batter when he thought I wasn't looking. So he grew up here? Right down the road. Matt's father is my late husband's brother. And do his parents still live here? Retired to Florida. Couldn't do it myself. Not quite Christmas to me without a blanket of snow. Man! The storm is really picking up out there. This should get you through tonight. The... storm? Is it... is it bad? Probably looking at one, two feet. Feet? Hi. Please tell me the runways are clear. Sure are. Plow's out there working around the clock. Thank goodness! Okay, so one ticket to Anchorage, earliest you've got. - Jessica. - Hi. I'm sorry, there's no flights today. What do you mean there's no flights today? Unfortunately, the plane is grounded for maintenance. The plane? There's only one plane? Yes. Yes, there's one, but it's a relatively simple repair. I'm just waiting on the part. Wait, you're the pilot and the mechanic? I make a mean gingerbread, too. Okay. All right, well, when do you think that it will be able to fly again? Part should be here by Monday. I'm sorry, I must have misheard you. I thought you said Monday. I did. As in three days from now? I called in a favor. Around these parts, three days is practically a Christmas miracle. It shouldn't take me too long once the part arrives. Okay... I'm sorry. No. Okay, thank you. Okay. All right. I guess this is goodbye. Right? Yeah, yeah, no problem. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise. It's a very good disguise. The Jingle Bell flowers can be a little temperamental. The closer you cut them to the wedding, the better. But I guess we could just use these ones for the festival, and if you don't mind a full house, I'm sure my aunt will let you stay a few extra nights. What am I supposed to do for three days? In Alaska? Well, you're definitely going to need a jacket... ...and boots. What? I'm wearing boots. Winter boots. Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you! - No problem. - Yes... So good. Just right here. - Thank you. - No problem. Where is everyone? Matt! Hey, Isa, what's up? We need your help. We need a few things for my friend here. You caught me just in time. I'm just packing some stuff up, and I'm gonna close for the festival. So the whole store shuts down for the festival? The whole town shuts down for the festival. Give me a shout if you need anything. Will do. All right, coats are over here. Scarves and sweaters... You know, I'm also gonna have to stop somewhere to get shampoo or toothpaste. One-stop shop for all of your essentials. So the pilot is a mechanic, and the clothing store is a pharmacy. Well, okay, I'm just spending the weekend. I'm not hiking the Himalayas. Well, you'll wish you had 'em when you start sinking into the drifts. Yeah. When in Alaska... So, you're from Tapeesa? Born and raised. Seems like it would be hard to be so isolated from the world. I don't see it as isolation. There's a whole community. I mean, life moves at a different pace here. You know, people take the time to appreciate what they have, and they don't just rush into the next thing... I guess no one told them. We've gotta get this stuff in my truck. Come on. So, what is this festival, exactly? It comes from an old town legend. In the 1800s, the town was settled by prospectors trying to find gold. They would decorate their Christmas trees with the flower that they found along the riverbanks. The Jingle Bell Flower. You got it. How about another round of applause for our talented troupe! All right! Thank you for coming out today to celebrate the beginning of the 66th annual Jingle Bell Festival. Yeah! Couldn't miss the opening ceremonies. We have four days of wonderful events planned for you all. You'll find posters all over town with the full schedule. Make sure to circle the final night's winter dance to experience Tapeesa's most cherished tradition, the Bouquet of Blessings. And now, it's time to kick off the festival. As is tradition, it's time to crown our Jingle Bell Princess. Please join me in welcoming our honored guest, Jessica Perez! You won. - Go on. - What? No... No, no, no. Is Jessica out there? She's right here! She's right here, guys. All right, let's go. Get up there, Jessica. Just take your hat off. Now, Jessica, do you solemnly swear to faithfully execute the duties of the Jingle Bell Princess, and keep Christmas in your heart all the days of the year? Yes. Cue the band! Not a word. I have a wedding to plan. I don't have time to be the queen of your festival. Princess, and it's strictly ceremonial. You shake some hands, kiss a few babies. Nothin' to it. Looks good on you. Uncle Matt! Hey, what's going on, little man? There you are. I was wondering if I'd see you here. When did y'all get in? We drove in an hour ago. Steve's back at the house. Hi! I'm Amanda. I'm... I'm Matt's cousin. I'm Jessica. Nice to meet you, Jessica. So... How long have you two been together? - No... - No, we're not... - No. - Definitely not. Definitely not? No, it's not that I don't think that... I mean, you're very... We just met. We just... - Really? - Yeah. Okay. I'm so sorry. Could you please excuse me for just one minute? - Sorry. - Please. Hello? Hello, Renee... Jessica, I need you. I... Is that a... dulcimer? No, no, no... it's a banjo. There's a problem with the dress. Again? More beads? I have to leave for a Christmas concert in 30. How soon can you be here? Well... I'm a little far at the moment. Midtown? Alaska. Alaska? Hello? Hey, daddy! Hey, just in time. I got everything down from the attic. Who's ready to decorate the tree? Yeah! I'll get the eggnog, and don't start without me. Okay, we won't. - Jessica? - Yeah? Would you like to join us? Well, I should probably be by my computer in case something comes up... It's nearly 10:00 on the east coast. They could survive without you for a little while. Yeah. Okay. That's beautiful. It's passed down through our family for six generations. Would you like to do the honors? Oh, no, I shouldn't. You should. Okay. Thank you. I'll go grab a step stool. I'll get that. Hey, I thought I lost this! It was a gift from Matt. When he lived in Manhattan, he would send a different decoration every year so that he could be with us in spirit. Matt lived in New York? Yeah, for years he taught at Lexington University. And why did he leave? Well, my father passed away early last year, and mom was having a very difficult time taking care of the farm alone, so Matt uprooted his whole life to come out and help her. He got the university to sponsor a dissertation while he's here. There's four feet of snow, night is day, and I have to stand on my head just to get reception. And there's no way you can get to another airport? No. The nearest one is 10 hours away, and every flight is booked, thanks to Christmas. What are you going to do? I just... manage things from here until the plane is fixed. So, tell me more about this Señor Jingle Bell. Is he cute? I'm in the middle of a crisis. It doesn't matter how cute the flower guy is. You're right. The better question is, is he single? Wait a minute. Are you making turrónes? Sí! I finally talked Tia Linda into giving me the secret recipe. No! This whole time, the secret ingredient was acacia honey. Yeah! I hate being so far away. I know. But it's good practice... for London. Right. Hey, Kara, I'm gonna have to call you back, okay? Okay! Good morning! Hi. Look at all that snow. Wouldn't you rather play outside? Well, I would, but my mom says I have to practice on the piano for an hour every day. I see. Well, I'll leave you to it. The community center's pipes froze. So we just lost our venue for the dance? Good morning. Good morning. Hi. Hey. There's coffee in the pot. Thank you. Maybe we can split up the dance over two different venues? No, don't do that. I'm sorry. I'm minding my own business. We had been planning to make the food on site, but even if we do find a new spot to host, we most likely won't have access to a kitchen. I guess we could find volunteers that can make something simple and transport. Lasagna, maybe? I'm guessing that's a "no," too. You can't serve lasagna. If the venue is already small, that means seating is limited. You can't serve a food that's difficult to eat, especially one that stains. She has a point. Sorry I'm late. A moose and its calf were crossing Beacher Road. I'm starting to think these moose crossings are worse than rush-hour traffic. Any luck with the community center? It's definitely a no, but I might have an alternative. I know it's not much to look at now. It's the best we can do under the circumstances. It's either this, or we cancel the dance. Well, it's certainly big enough. I know you'll be able to work wonders. I'll do my best. If there's anything else you need, let me know. Diamond in the rough. The very, very rough. The Jingle Bell dance is supposed to be the festival's big finale. You know, the night everyone looks forward to all year. This? This is a disaster. Meh, I once planned a destination wedding on a cruise ship, and the night before, it was stuck in an island port 500 miles away. And what did you do? What you're going to do now... improvise. Look, all you need is just a little imagination. We can put the band there. Then we can just scatter tables around the hall and string up some lights. "We"? Well, I'm clearly stuck here for the time being, so let me help you. It's the least I can do. Cool. Those don't go together. Actually, they're both indigenous to the region. All right. Ta da! Not bad. Trust me. This is what I do. That looks beautiful. Well... we might as well put that expertise to good use. Jessica, do you think you could give me a hand with these lights? I don't know what happens in this box, but they always end up a tornado. I'd be happy to help. Thank you, Jack. Another fire. You can handle this on your own, right? - Yeah, of course. - Great, thank you. You're a lifesaver. Hey. Hey, I don't know what to do with these napkins. Let me see. You don't like it? I could also do an elf's hat, or a tree, or a swan, but that doesn't really fit the decor... - No, it's lovely. - Here, you try. Okay. Like this? Well, that might be better than mine. Amanda, do you know where the white lights are? Yes, we stored them back in the supply closet. I'll go get them. Here you go. Thank you. No problem. What's this? Well, the elementary school used to hold their Christmas pageants here. Really? I have an idea. Cool. What are you thinking? Well... I can't decide. What's our theme? What do you mean? What do you want our snowman to be? Jolly? I'd go with the top hat, and don't worry, I'm waving my normal consultation fee. All right. So, hold on, what brought all this on? We... we used to have one of these every year in my town. And let me guess, you were the reigning champion? No. I was the judge. What is all this? A snowman-building contest. Jessica's idea. I just thought that they might have fun. I think we may have found a new addition to the festival. Me too. Good job. Thanks. That's a beautiful song. Off your second album, right? Hi! I thought I was meeting with Entertainment Tonight tomorrow. I'm not a reporter. I'm with Novak Events. I have your veil. I just want to reassure you we're dotting every "i" and crossing every "t" when it comes to your big day. I appreciate that. Jessica has not let me down yet. Well, hopefully she'll be back in time for the ceremony. You don't think she will be? She's certainly trying her best. I know how stressful it can be to have your wedding planner out of reach. I'm Rebecca. You can feel free to call me day or night. Thank you. No. No, no, no, no, no, no. It's 209 vegetarians, 86 gluten free, and 17 paleo, and a partridge in a pear tree. Okay, that last part was a joke. Wait, hello? Hello? The call dropped. I have almost no cell service here. Well, for some, it's a selling point. Who? Who are these people? Everyone, gather 'round! I'm going to need your help. We're gonna light up the tree, so let's count down from three, okay? All together! Three! Two! One! Aren't you glad you didn't miss this? Yeah. Princess duty calls. More photos? Yup. Come on, now. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. All right. So... Jessica's nice. When's the last time you went out on a date? Three months ago. You set it up. I remember that. When's the last time you went out on a second date? Amanda, it's not that I don't appreciate your well-intentioned meddling... Assistance. But I'm just not ready for a relationship right now. Well, maybe you don't have to look. Maybe one just dropped in with the blizzard. Do you want two flapjacks or three? Matt... It's been two years, and I know that you were hurt, but if you dwell on all the might-have-beens, you're gonna close yourself off to all the wonderful could-bes. - Hey. - Hey. We're just heading down to the hall to do some decorating. You okay? Yeah... I just, I haven't heard from Renee today. Isn't that a good thing? Not when she typically calls me more than my own sister. She called me yesterday, and didn't leave a message, and I called her back, and she didn't answer. I really can't afford to lose her trust. Pulling off this wedding is a "make or break" for my career. Well, maybe you should remind Renee why you came up here in the first place. Do you have any mistletoe? No. That's too bad. Would have been nice. Nothing says "love" quite like mistletoe. I don't understand. Did you know that mistletoe is actually pretty toxic? Way to suck the romance out of the room. Romance, huh? Just keep clipping. You know, I have to admit, Renee has good taste. These look great in a bouquet. I don't know how you do it. Well, it's just about lining up the stems... No, no, I mean, spend your life racing around trying to meet someone else's whims, you know? Weddings can be stressful for couples, and everyone expects perfection, and the unwritten rule of celebrity weddings is that it has to be bigger and more unique than the last. Did you always know that this is what you wanted to do? Yeah. When I was little, I used to beg my mother to plan the Christmas parties and the birthdays. I just... I like bringing people together. Creating memories. What about your own memories? What about them? What did you do last Christmas? I was at a ski chalet in Val d'Isere, France. Unforgettable eggnog. Okay, were you surrounded by friends and family, or clients and guests? Okay, well, what about you? When were you going to tell me that you lived in New York? The secret's out, huh? Okay, well... I was married, and, long story short, it didn't work out. I'm sorry. No, no, no, wasn't meant to be. I know that now, but at the time, it was hard, being in New York. But Alaska has been good for me. It gave me space. And are you planning on going back? I don't know. I think I'm... I'm happy right where I am. This collar is tighter than I remember. Goodness. Sorry, I thought she might get a better idea if she saw it on a jacket. Bad idea, right? No, no, no! No, no, no, it's... It's a great idea. Okay, well, I got this for last year's festival. I haven't worn it very often. How do I...? Here. Let me. They smell good. How do I look? You look good. Here. Say "Jingle Bells". Okay, just smile. The sun is already setting. I don't think I'll ever get used to that. Hey, can I show you something? Yeah, what? It's a surprise. Just let me get changed. Okay. The Aurora Borealis. I... All right, let's get you up here. Yeah... I've seen it hundreds of times, and it never loses its magic. What? I just... It's just that if... If you would have told me a week ago that I would just be sitting on a truck, just staring at the sky, I would have said you were nuts. Yup. Honestly, life is too precious to just race through. Sometimes you just gotta stop and appreciate what's around. Thank you... for bringing me here. Of course. You know, I thought you might wanna make a memory all your own. I've never seen anything like it. Clearest night all week. I feel like we got really lucky. Yeah, I guess we did. So... I'm gonna go. Okay. Good night. 'Night. Hey, Matt? Hey? Thank you. My pleasure. I am still mad at you. Hey. You still having trouble with that note? I always forget which key it is. Give me one second. Here. I used to do this to my niece, Kaylee, when she was learning. And it helped? She's the hit of every Christmas party. Okay... which key was it? - This one? - Yeah. I got it! I knew you would! Try again. That's so good. I'd play along with you, but I just... I'm a little rusty. I thought you said you played with your niece. Yeah, I... I used to. I haven't in a while. Why not? Well, I've been a little busy. Yeah. Hi! You've reached Kara Lawson. Leave a message after the tone, and have a very merry Christmas. Hey, sis, it's me. I... I was just thinking about you, and I wanted to say hi. Call me back, okay? Bye. Hey, what's going on? Hey... we're gonna take a little break. Grab your boots and your jacket. Okay. So, we're making snow angels? Yeah, at Foley Field. It's one of the most popular events at the festival. But isn't that a little... juvenile? What are you doing? Checking the festival bylaws. Nope, nothing about an age limit, but you gotta be this tall to participate, and look at that, you just squeaked through. Let's go... Well, I'm not really dressed for it. Hey, look, it's the Princess! Yes, right here. Snow angels! Let's go. Okay, so do we just... No, no, not yet. We gotta look for the perfect canvas. Okay, where did you do it last year? I didn't. Why not? It's more fun with a partner. Okay, here. This is the spot? Yeah. All right. Go ahead. Me? Yeah. Fall back. No. You first. Okay, we'll go together. Together. Okay. Okay. Come on. All right. And... three! You were right. Yeah, that was fun. Cold, but fun. Hot chocolate? - Yeah. - All right, cool. Barbara? The reporter from Esquire is here hoping to get some behind-the-scenes on the Renee wedding. I'll be right there. Any word from Jessica? No new updates. Maybe it's time for someone to step in. Renee is pretty adamant about sticking with Jessica. In these cases, I defer to the bride. Besides, Jessica has been true to her word in staying on top of things remotely. You and I both know the last 48 hours are chaos, and they cannot be handled on a conference call. She's done a good job, but we can't afford a fumble. Let me get this over the finish line. I'll grab these, and... Yeah. I'm going to... - Okay. - Yeah. All right. Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. Let me know if you need any help. Okay, thank you. Those are Jingle Bell flower pendants. Right, snowflake or candy cane? Snowflake. All right. And what are we cheers-ing to? To getting home. To getting home. See anything you like? Yeah, I was looking for something for my sister. I... I opened my Christmas present early. Our mother had one just like it when we were little. It's lovely. My assistant got her a gift card. Yeah. My sister and I live in the same city, and I can hardly find a minute for her, and I swear my niece grows a foot taller every time I see her. Maybe you should change that when you get back. Yeah. So, what is the Bouquet of Blessings, exactly? Well, every member of the town is given a bouquet of the Jingle Bell flowers, and they write their Christmas wish on a little tag, and attach it to the flowers, and then they place it in the display. It's like a little reminder that Christmas is a time of hope, but you'll see that tonight. Tonight? Yeah, at the dance. I... I didn't realize I was going. Well, I mean, you can't come to the Jingle Bell festival and miss the best part. I don't have anything to wear... I'm sure you'll look great in anything. I mean, that there's not like a dress code, or anything like that. So... would you like to go? Yeah, I would. All righty, then. Let's go. This should fit. We're about the same size. Thank you. The only clothing store in town doesn't sell formal wear, and I didn't think I should show up in a parka. Well, I think you're gonna knock Matt's socks off. Well, we're not... It's... it... He's only taking me because I helped. - Right. - My mistake. No, really. - We believe you. - We do. Now, what are you thinking about doing with your hair? Hey... It's too much. Your cousin talked me into the heels and the hair. No, you look beautiful. Hey, captain Jack! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, indeed. I've got good news. The part came in early. Really? Yup. Flight's back on schedule. Wheels up, 8:00 a.m. sharp tomorrow. Is there any way we can leave any sooner? Airport's closed, I'm sorry. Not much fun being away from people you care about during the holidays. I'm sure you're eager to get back. Yeah... yeah. There's your chance. My chance? Mistletoe. Welcome, Tapeesa, to the final night of the Jingle Bell Flower Festival. These past few days have been full of a lot of wonderful moments with friends and family, but we've reached my favorite part of the festival, the Bouquet of Blessings. So if you'll all join me at the back of the room, and if I could request the help of our Jingle Bell Princess? Jess... Merry Christmas. There you go. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. I'm going to get on stage. Okay. Yeah. Madame. Merry Christmas, Mary. Merry Christmas, Ben, and thank you again for the lovely tree. Well, when I saw it, I... I thought of you. Listen, I was just thinking... Well, I thought... Look, I'm not very good at this. Would you like to dance? Yes. You look lovely. Thank you. So, what did you write? It's a secret. Okay, I see, I see. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite so beautiful. Yeah, me too. Yeah. I haven't done this in a while. Here. I've had to help many grooms with their first-dance jitters. Just... look at me, take a deep breath... and sway. Yeah, there you go. So, it looks like tonight was a success. Yeah, seems so. Thank you, for all your help. I'm the one that should be thanking you. For what? For bringing a little Christmas spirit to my week. Well, you know... I could ignore that. No, no, it's okay. - Are you sure? - Go ahead. Okay. Hello? Hello, hello, hello, can you hear me? Please tell me what I'm hearing in the background is a noisy airport terminal. Not exactly, but I should be able to fly out tomorrow morning. That is cutting it real close, Jessica. Even if everything goes exactly perfect, you still need time to prep. I think, given the circumstances, it makes sense that Rebecca takes it from here. You're taking me off the account? I've spoken with Renee, and she agrees it's best for everyone involved. What about the flowers? We're gonna have to make do with what we have. Barbara, please, I... I can do this. I know I can. I just need a little bit more time. We're out of time. I'm sorry, Jessica. Hey, there you are. You gotta be freezing. What's wrong? I just lost everything. What happened? I told my boss that I couldn't fly out until tomorrow, and they said they couldn't wait. I tried so hard, and... and I let everyone down. I put everything I had into this wedding. I did long hours. Thousands of phone calls. I sacrificed dates... Christmas plans... all to make this perfect, and now I can't even see it until the end. Maybe it worked out for the best. How can you say that? Well, are you happy, Jess? You're always trying to make someone else's dream come true, and never your own? Well, I guess I can't be like you. I can't hide out in Alaska with my life on hold thousands of miles away. Okay, that's not fair. I'm sorry. I have to go. Hey, Jessica, wait. Jessica! ...fly down to Seattle, have a bite to eat. I'm sorry, I gotta tell you, you look absolutely stunning tonight. Thank you. Hey, I thought you left. Everything okay? I need a favor. I'm sorry, Jessica. I had no choice. I needed someone here. I can't do this on my own. No, no, don't be. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I let you down. I know how much you wanted Jingle Bell flowers in your bouquet. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done. I wish it could be different, and I'm just so sorry you're 3,000 miles away from your family because of me. Don't be. I made the choice. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hey, come in. I just got a call from Matt. He wants you to pack up everything you've got. We're supposed to meet him at the airport in 20. Wait. The airport? Why? What's going on? You're going home. Are you leaving? Yeah, I gotta get home. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. You take care, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Hi! Got everything? Yes, I think so. I'm definitely leaving with a lot more than I came with. I hope you have room for one more thing. You didn't have to. I give one to all of the festival volunteers. You make sure to reach out to Matt when you touch down. Let us know you got in safe. I will. Thank you. How is this happening? Maggie made some calls to open the airport. We wanted to make sure. Thank you. Wait, "we"? Isa! Good luck. Thank you. Mr. Gregory... Hey, Mr. G. Wait, who's flying the plane? I'm not sure. I am. Of course. See you out there. Yes. Yeah. The flowers are all set, and I called ahead to the Anchorage airport, let them know the proper way to store the flowers when you switch planes. I can't believe you did all this. Thank you... for everything. Of course. Well, you need to... Yeah, yeah, I... Wait a second here. For your flight. I mean, in case you get hungry. Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go. Hey, Matt? Yeah? If you're ever back in New York, just... look me up. Yeah. I'll do that. Okay. The caterers are set. I doubled the security detail, since the paparazzi started staking out their spot a day early, and the dress is on its way to Renee now. And the bouquet? We put in that order last minute. I'll call the florist to get an update. That won't be necessary. I've got the Jingle Bell flowers. Jessica? I thought you were stuck in Alaska. I was, but we have the reputation of making the impossible possible. Well, I'm a woman of my word. The promotion is yours. About that... I hope I'm not too late. Of course not. - I turned down the London job. - You did? Why? I think I want to stick a little closer to home. You opened it early! I did. I'm sorry. You know I've never been good with patience. Look who made it! Feliz Navidad. - Feliz Navidad. - Feliz Navidad. Tia Jess! I hope Jessica got home in time. She did. She let me know. You two seem to have gotten very close. Yeah. I mean, she was a big help. Is that all? I mean, there might have been something there, for a minute, but that moment passed. Are you sure? I'm here, and she has her life back in New York. So do you, Matt. Not anymore. But you could. You know what, aunt Mary, if I didn't know any better, I'd think that you were trying to get rid of me. I appreciate everything you've done, helping me when your uncle passed, but I think it's time for you to finish that dissertation and get back to the life you built for yourself in New York. It's finished. What? My research. Yeah, I finished it a while ago. I guess I haven't been ready to... go back. Maybe you finally found something worth returning for. It's perfect. Not quite. You got them. I promised, didn't I? Mom... They're beautiful. She got them. The ceremony is in 15 minutes. Jessica? Thank you. Of course. She got them. Give me one second. Thank you so much for the perfect ceremony. Take these. Maybe they'll bring some luck for you. Thank you. What are you doing here? Well, you did say if I was ever in the city... I spoke to the Dean at the university. I'll be teaching classes again next semester. Right down the road, actually. So you're back? For good? Yeah. Look, I went to Alaska for a fresh start, and I stayed because I was scared of getting hurt again, but when you close yourself off, the good stays out, too. Jess, I want to take a risk again... if that risk is you. So... what do you think? I guess wishes do come true. Nice jacket. Thank you. I thought you might need a date to the reception, so... - Shall we? - We shall. - You look great. - Thank you. Be careful. How's everybody back home? They're going to feel good. Yeah?
