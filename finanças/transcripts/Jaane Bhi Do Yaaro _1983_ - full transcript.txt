Not a soul in sight! Ah! There comes one. Welcome, welcome! The auspicious hour is passing away. And you are sleeping? The auspicious hour has passed two and a half hours ago. What are you upto? - Nothing. Why haven't the guests arrived as yet? - You invited twenty five of them. Where are they? - As if your guests have arrived. l feel that the guests will surely come. Let's wait. What were we doing till now? - We have to wait, Sudhir. We got to run our business, no? We borrowed 7500 from Dharamji and 2500 from Kundan Shah. Don't we have to return them? - Add to it today's expense. How much is that? - More than a thousand. The guests will come. Believe me, they will come. ''We shall overcome'' ''We shall overcome'' ''We have faith'' ''lmplicit faith'' ''We shall overcome'' Remember it, always. Sweet is the fruit of hardwork and honesty. But how long does it take? - lt depends... Don't. lt's for the guests. l told you to get trousers that fit. You've picked up a loose one. Thank the launderer for giving this. He wasn't even ready to part with it. Besides, life offers you this and much more. You just got to make adjustments. Like me. ls this fine? - Yes. A guest. l'll go and receive her. But l invited her. She's my guest. l've been waiting for long. What kept you? Where's your mummy? Good you came alone. The city's best photo studio's partners, Vinod and Sudhir... cordially welcome you. Let's click a beautiful photo... There they are! Vinod and Sudhir welcome you all. Who's that? Mr Kamdar will now inaugurate... - Another photo studio? our Super Photo Studio. Mr Kamdar, please cut the ribbon. As you all know, Mr Kamdar is an assistant editor... of a leading magazine, ''Khabardar''. A magazine that exposes the evil... and corruption in our society. And it is located right opposite. My friends, my well-wishers, l hope Mr Kamdar will be kind enough... to keep offering me contracts. That's all l have to say. Now l'll request Mr Kamdar to cut the ribbon. Applause! l did just as you asked me to. Not a single guest will go that way. Tables, tablecloths, beers... and snacks... l messed up everything. Beauty Studio has downed shutters. Sabotage! Guests have arrived! - Congratulations! Congratulations, congratulations! Three months have passed without a single customer. Possibly today...? Zoom. Closer. Closer? - Yes. More? - Yes. Closer, eh?! When did you come? Got some assignment? - Nothing. l just met Kamdar. - How long can we pull on like this? Think of some ideas. - There's just one. l've told you! Good salesmanship. Not just shooting girls! Win the hearts of customers! - Provided we have customers. And how's your daughter? Here's your wife's photo. Wonderful! What composition! Perfect framing. Excuse me... - My wife looks okay. But he has captured her beautifully. Great! l guess, you must've done a diploma in photography? Oh no, doctorate. - Doctorate?! That shows in the photograph. He has done his doctorate. Take a look. lt's Hema Malini. No less an actress, isn't she? - Right. So, how many copies do l make? - 20,000. 20,000...? - Twenty. The thousand later. Anything else? - Get off my back, will you? Attend to this gentleman. He's been waiting for long. Tell me, how can l help you? - Take this, mister... Don't you want to be photographed? Let him take your photo. What is he saying? l don't... - l'll shoot you in such a way that... it will make the women hold their hearts. l told you, he's an amazing salesman. He won't leave you just like that. Don't lose him. - Never. Come on, this way. - Go on before the light goes off. Where are you taking me? - Don't you worry. l'll fix that fat nose. Come on. No pushing... will you listen to me? - You listen to us! We haven't earned a penny since three months. Get in. Vonod, let me see how he doesn't get photographed. Sit! Don't move! Now tell me. How many copies? - l haven't come for a photo session. Then why have you come? - To collect the rent of this place. You haven't paid the owner for three months. The rent? You came to collect rent? Why didn't you tell us before? You never gave me a chance. - Can't help. We're so busy that... we don't even get a chance to think of rent. You may leave now. l'll send a cheque as soon as my partner comes in. Okay? Bye. Why did you have to give me the actress' post card? Why did l have to, eh? And why did you have to show him that? Hello, l've got some work for you. Are you hurt? What brings you here? - l got some work for you. Work? Please be seated. What is it about? - lt was tough getting the editor... to offer the two of you an assignment. - So kind of you, sir. Great! - Why did you take the trouble? You should've summoned us over. - Tell us more about it. lt's a trial assignment. Go on. - The work should be good enough... to satisfy the editor. - Rest assured, Mr Kamdar. Well, Sudhir? - Right. Hang on, hear me out. Super Studio made me a chief guest just to fool me We know. Remember, every task of Khabardar is secretly carried out. lt exposes the city's rich and famous That guy, Ashok, from the studio over there.... What's the matter? Come here. Beware of Ashok. - Sure. He's is Tarneja's man. - Tarneja...? Who is that? He got Super Studio put up here. To spy on Khabardar magazine. But who is he? - What? You don't know Tarneja? He is the city's biggest con man. Corrupt, and a big time swindler. He makes roads, flyovers and skyscrapers. Mr Tarneja is here, Ashok. Hurry up! As you ordered, we've sold 2000 bags of cement in the black market, sir. l've told you! Such things should be spoken about in whispers. But we're left with only 5000 bags whereas we need 10,000 bags. Have you heard of the Kutch desert? - Yes sir. lt's huge. Yes, huge enough. Don't let it grow any more. Gather the sands and stuff as many sacks. 10,000, 20,000... as many as you wish. - But sir, that can prove harmful. That's business, Tuliani. Some lose, some gain. l spoke to the Municipal surveyor. He disallows us... from building the 24th floor of Tarneja Towers. lt's illegal, he says. The law is for the common man, not for Tarneja. Go and build the 24th, even the 25th floor. Sir, the commissioner is here. Tarneja has come in a Toyota, eh! When did you come from America? This time you took so long? Oh yes, the job was such. l had been studying their drainage system. America is great. They have separate conduits for waste and drinking water We lag far behind. We must do something. But we can't do anything. America is matchless. We lag behind in gutters... and their buildings tower over ours. They have hundred storeyed buildings. - Of course, l've seen them. That reminds me, D'mello, the government announces that... the constructions in place of the slums will be permitted more... More Free Space lndex. - Yes, FSl. And more floors. And l'm not getting permissions for 24 floors. lt's strange. But Tarneja, there are no slums here. Slums aren't visible from here. But you could see them clearly... from the 24th and 25th floors. 40 percent of Bombay's populace... live in the slums, D'mello. - They have us surrounded... from all quarters. Look, sir. - So sir, we must get the permission. All right. Go ahead and make the 24th floor. But permission for a foot more is impossible. The commissioner before you used to say that nothing is impossible. But l adhere to some principles. l'm a responsible officer. And what do you think? My father owns the Municipality? No sir, you own it. Granted. Yet, l can't grant permission for the 25th floor. Shall l put it logically, D'mello? - Go ahead. Assume that it's your birthday today. And l'm offering you a present. One cheque. A cheque of 99,999. You'd find the amount odd, won't you? - Yes, l would. You must. Because the amount isn't a round figure. And 100,000 is a round figure. Tarneja, it's tough to score over you in logic. All right. Make the 25th floor. Send a real good cake over to D'mello's house. And listen, go and give it personally. - Both us will go over, sir. l hear Switzerland's cakes are damn good. You'll have them, too. What have you thought about the Bandra cemetery? What's the logic behind that? - lt's very simple, sir. The cemetery is choked.They've even put up the ''No Entry'' sign. The sign looks too good. - Ever since he was a kid... Mr Tarneja has been dreaming of constructing a building... over the cemetery, that will rise to the skies. You know that, sir. lt is possible, D'mello. - Never, Tarneja. No. At least let the dead rest in peace. Why must you disturb them? What are you saying, Mr D'mello? The basement is exclusively for them. Now listen to my logic. There's a park beside the cemetery. Clean up the cemetery and create an amusement park instead. Clear the existing park and pull up a high-rise building in its place. And on the 25th floor, reserve two flats for me. Tarneja, what's happening to the Mahim flyover? lt's been three years. When will you complete that? - Pretty soon, D'mello. The contracts for the rest of the flyovers is mine, is it not? Let's discuss it across the table. Come over to my beach house. That reminds me of something important. Khabardar magazine. What rot it is writing about me! That l accept bribes from you is also published. How do they get to know about our secrets? Not to worry, D'mello. Such fleas do keep flying about. l'll find a cure for them. - Do it. Else... a honest man like me will get killed. Not to forget the cake. Don't you come! Handling Khabardar is your business. Make no mistake. They mustn't even suspect that you work for me. Madam! Our last issue was just a cracker. But you will see, our next issue will just blow them off. lf the truth about the 24th and 25th floors outs... Tarneja will lose his sleep. - Kamdar! What's so exciting? Such insignificant evidences won't break Tarneja down. Madam, the 2nd machine is out of order. So? Where's Fernandes? - On leave. His wife is marrying Marrying whom? - Fernandes. Love and weddings! So sick! All right, let me look into it. By God, you are in full glory, like the moon. Touchwood! Watch how l glow in there! This editor is going to run for cover What has she been publishing against us? Wait and see. l'll fly away with all the evidence against Mr Tarneja She's going to be in a spin! Where is the editor? Where? Where is the editor? l made a mistake! Please try to understand! lt'll kill me! How did they get in? Were you asleep? - No, l saw them coming Has the work we gave Beauty Photo Studio been completed? lt's being done, Madam... - Being done? What's being done? You can't do anything l'll personally go and take a look whether they are worthy of our trust What a stunner! What a bomb! But she's a customer. And what's that Sunil said? l'll show Welcome The equal partner of the most beautiful studio in town, welcomes you l promise to take a photograph which will want every man to marry you! Mister, l came here because... - l know! As a photographer... l can see in your eyes what you wish to say You dream of being a model.

Let me try modelling So come here and sit down Push that hair back. And look there... bring passion to your eyes, bring sensuality to it Let me wipe your forehead l promise. l'll take only a picture. l won't take anything else The relationship between a cameraman and a model is like that... of a patient and a doctor There's nothing between them. Do away with all covers! Work over! - No. The real work begins now Know who l am? l'm editor of ''Khabardar'' Now give me the job Kamdar entrusted to you So you're Shobhaji! Glad to meet you. l thought you were Rita She's a struggling model. l've made a mistake. Forgive me Return the works to me or l'll call the police Police? l'll get it in a moment Where's Sudhir? Where does he keep disappearing? The equal partner of the most beautiful studio in town, welcomes you l promise to take a picture that'll send the men in the world in raptures As a professional photographer, l can see in your eyes, what you want You dream of becoming a model Only one man can fulfill that dream. That is... Vinod! Where've you been, Sudhir? We have a customer Now look at that picture And look at this one And look at all these - And this one! When she first came to your studio... she was clad in a burqa. And look at her now! l'll go one step further Once you get working. Let's go. - Please come Shut up! Where do you go during business hours? She's... - Later Sit at the desk. Don't move. Go on! Listen to me, Vinod! She's no customer! She's Shobha! These locks... Look ahead. Ahead Bring sensuality to your eyes. Passion You're sweating... let me wipe it A photographer and a model ought to share a relationship... like that of a doctor and a patient There must be nothing hidden. So do away with everything... lt's Shobhaji. Editor, Khabardar Return the job to me. Go on Shobhaji! Forgive him! He thought you were Rita too Do you now believe we were really expecting her? lt's not our mistake. lt's Rita's actually Why hasn't she shown up? - To hell with Rita! Why spoil our relationships because of her... Check out our work, madam. They're morons, no doubt. But they're good at their work l can make use of the two of them l will give you another chance The work you're now going to do is very dangerous At 10, next Saturday,... at the Commissioner's bungalow at Madh lslands... there's going to be a secret meeting between Tarneja and the Commissioner You needn't worry. l'll be with you this time We'll quietly record their conversation and take pictures Come here Get to that window Over there! l can't hear anything. We'll have to open the window This is a cake from Switzerland and here's a small gift, Mr D'Mello For your kids This is the revised quotation of those fly-overs. Take a good look What are you up to, Tarneja? There's a difference of a hundred thousand between this and the original! You quoted less in the original That was only to have the quotation passed So that's why! You told us to increase the figure later Bloody idiot! Did l ask you to increase it by so much? You've doubled the figure! Do you want to land me in trouble? See when the bid was passed. lt was a year ago How much have prices increased since then? Things are so much more expensive. Prices have doubled lncluding your fee Treat Mr D'Mello to some cake first Nice cake, all right You'll okay the bid, won't you? - Forget about the bid... and tell me, you'll meet me at Madh lslands again, won't you? See that bid? The one Tarneja gave the Commissioner? We must get a picture of that. At any cost Don't tell me! - That's it! Think of a way. - What a thing to say! There are four men in there. Taking pictures is impossible You saw he had a gun? Others must have guns too l have one too This is a toast is to the bid. Bloody idiot! Who rang that bell, sir...? - l'll check it out. At once! l'll check... - No, l will! Are you the Commissioner's cook? - Cook! Tell him that the reporter from the Times and Newsweek is here... to interview him. - America's famous magazine!

How come you're early, Ahuja? An hour before the appointed time? ls your watch running ahead? What's that? Ahuja? What's my business rival doing here at the Commissioner's? Why has he come to the Commissioner? - You ought to know How would l know? You're scolding me as if l invited him over! So you happened to remember my words at last That's not true, Ahuja. Pangs of conscience, you see Forget it You were blacklisted, you see You've been into a lot of hanky-panky Who isn't upto hanky-panky in this business? You've snapped my shoe! - When have l done that? Because of you, my Blood Pressure has shot up! Look, don't talk to me like that. - Shut up! You have no right to talk to me like that! Get that down! Get down! l love you so much and you keep cursing me Ahuja, you drink too much. How will you listen to me if you get drunk? l drink with my mouth, not my ears! Let's talk business - lt's like this...

We both have our specialities, Ahuja. We're in the same business. Why don't we work together? You build two flyovers. And l'll build the other two Brotherhood, l see! You had me black-listed last year. Where was your brotherhood then? You're sitting on pins and needles this year! Don't be silly, Ahuja. Don't go overboard on the strength... of the Commissioner. l go far higher than him Which means you want to have me black-listed all over again l can too. - Really? Got it? - Yes Good, they're fighting. They're arguing loudly! May l say something, if you don't mind? Go ahead lf Mr Ahuja gives us two flyovers... we can easily bury him in the graveyard at Bandra Why, you pipsqueak! - l'm sorry, sir l mean, we can make him a partner in the graveyard at Bandra What say, Ahuja? lt's a fair deal. What do you think? He's got them to stop fighting What amount does the project involve? About 50 to 60 million 50 million? - Yes Do something! They mustn't compromise. What will you tell Shobha? So what do you think, Ahuja? 50 million? - Yes, 50 million Let's split it 50:50. You take 25, l take 25 l have a trunk-call, sir.

She's making mincemeat of you, ass! - l know She has taken photographs of your bid! Photographs of the bid? - At the Commissioner's bungalow! The bungalow?

Hold it! There's someone in my room! He's listening to our conversation Where is he? Drive him out! Have you listened to our conversation? Were you listening to us talking? Are you deaf?. Pinto, he's deaf. - l know And once l tell you what l have to... you'll be dumb-founded Why? - Because that editor... has you trapped so badly... it's difficult for you to survive How come? Because, right now, under your roof, under your very nose... the editor's best friend, your enemy is very much present Who is it? Who? Pinto! Who is it? Ahuja. - Ahuja? He's here to strike a deal A deal? Deal, did you say? - Yes He's putting on an act, l tell you. He's hand in glove with the editor What proof do you have? Please don't scare me Proof?. Ahuja wears a wig. Get it? lf you want those pictures of the bid back... you'll find them under the wig Ahuja's wearing a wig, sir He's hiding the photographs of our bid under the wig He's conning us! Check out his wig Who is it? What are you doing? Get his wig! Pull it off! lt's a wig, sir! - Bodyguards! He's trying to double-cross us. Your game is up! What are you guys doing? What are you doing? Listen to me... You guys won't listen! l want to tell you something very important The flyovers you're fighting over... neither of you's getting the contract What are you getting at? - The Commissioner has fooled us He has given the contracts to a third person How can he do that? He has taken a bribe from me! He's taken a bribe from us also. But this is true How do you know? - Mr Srivastav told me That's impossible. - But it has happened Look, l have photo-copies of the contract Commissioner! l'll fix you! Tarneja, you bastard! l will always remember what you have done for me, Mr Srivastav l always hope to be of some use to you, sir Please wait inside. l'll join you in a moment This Commissioner's getting out of hand Arrange a meeting between us at the earliest l've been screaming my lungs out for you ls this why l pay you guys? Tarneja, l'm not going to spare you And D'Mello! You're dead! Vinod, this thing is getting murkier Tarneja, the Commissioner and Ahuja...? it stinks! They're all out to cut each other's throats lt would be best for us to save our necks They're the ones who steal, and we find ourselves in a mess That editor of yours is no less. - What are you talking about? You're bent on maligning the poor girl. Don't you see? She's doing such great social service Social service, my foot! She lives in a bungalow. And we're starving You always say that the fruit of labour is sweet Here you are... have a banana for your labour Eat it up Go on. - l don't want to lt's from our first earning. Please Vinod, look at this Should we take part in this? - Forget it We won't get any prize. They might give us t-shirts No, the first prize is 5000 in cash l've found the 5000 buck shot. Look at that Here... come here A banana Hurry up Vinod, what do you think about this? Well, it's quite beautiful But it's not a prize-winner. - Why not? They'll drive us out But look at my shot from a human angle How about your face in the mirror? Where? - There's your reflection. Look What's this? lt's not me. - Who's this? Someone with a check-coat l wasn't wearing a coat. Nor was l in that spot ls this a camera...? Or is it a pistol? Let me see Vinod, this is really a pistol How about enlarging it? Vinod, is that Ashok? What's he...? This is a pistol. For sure This man shot at this man... but who is he? He's behind the bush. Let's enlarge it some more Vinod, whose hands are these? He must've stood here when he was shot and he fell in the shrubs Tough to tell who's firing Let's enlarge it some more Look This guy with the pistol... it's Tarneja himself! He has a pistol in his hand and he's firing at someone... whose face is hidden in the shrubs So Tarneja has murdered someone. - Yes. But who was it? Vinod, let's go back home This is it. Let's go in Who is it? Vinod, we are in the wrong park. - Shut up! Look, this is the branch under which you took the pictures Let's go over there. - l said it was here! l'm the elder! So shut up! This is our banana-peel. - As if nobody else has bananas! Look at this Yes. Remember, we changed the roll. - Near the monkey... here Here Here was the mirror This is where we took the picture So the murder was committed right behind us Which means... the body's right behind us! Let's take a look. - Let's go home, Vinod C'mon! Look... - That's the board Which means, this is where the murder took place Come on There's no one here. - Shut up! This is the wrong place. - lt's right. The board's there ln the middle. Which means l was standing over there... the victim was here, and Tarneja must have been here Go and stand there. Go on! - No! lmagine l'm Tarneja Now l'll fire at you. And you will fall down No, let's go home Haven't we to find the corpse? So stand here One, two, three... Why did you run away?

Come and show me How's this possible? l saw it for myself So where has it gone? - Blood...? What's this? lt's a cuff-link lt's the same cuff-link Who is it...? Who? They've taken the body away Subtitles Encoded By Desi Doctor @ Team Bindass We can't go to the cops without any proof We don't even know whose body it was lt makes me happy you're inaugurating the flyover, Commissioner Srivastav Please Congratulations Please come lt's a great day for us that the D'Mello Flyover is being inaugurated This flyover is the fruit of the hardwork of thousands of people... and it's a big step forward in the progress of the people of Bombay This flyover is a symbol of our commitment, hardwork and faith This is not just a flyover. lt's a dream of millions in the city lt's meant for the whole society, not just for one man lndustrialists, workers, hawkers, or even political leaders and peons And some day, many poor people will make their homes under this bridge lt's unfortunate that the man who was responsible for this bridge... is not with us anymore. Mr D'Mello was fighting this terrible disease... for which he even had to go to Switzerland for a cure And Christ has taken him away from us Was the Commissioner ill? - Something is fishy lt wasn't the Commissioner's body, was it? l will now request Mr Srivastav... to speak in memory of Mr D'Mello... and dedicate this bridge to this memory l just can't say enough in praise of Mr D'Mello He has become immortal for what he did on a single programme And that programme is gutter Mr D'Mello always said... that a nation is known by its gutters He is dead But his last word before he died was... gutter ln his memory, we will close all the gutters in the city for a day l appeal to all of you to have your drinking water one day in advance May his soul rest in peace You will be happy to know that this press conference... has been organised on the tallest skyrise in the city This skyrise is a gift to the city from Mr Tarneja, alongwith the flyover Mr Tarneja has built an empire in such a short time Mr Tarneja is always ahead even in matters of social service lt's said that behind every success is a crime. You've reached the peak of success. How would you respond to that? What a bookish expression! To be successful, all you need is hardwork and honesty. Period Even your labour works hard. But he's rotting in your factories What were you 10 years ago? A mere contractor? The press is jealous of anybody's success To rise in life, you need ideals and a commitment lt's our job to highlight the filth behind the ideals Why do you view everything with suspicion? One has to rise above problems of every day life And who doesn't want to rise in life? - Your rise is too much, Mr Tarneja Don't you want to rise in life? - No, Mr Tarneja The more you rise, the more people fall Where...? lnto their hells? Yes, you could call it hell The destiny of 800 million lndians... lies in the hands of less than 10,000 people How can they ever rise in life, when they find... their feet caught in the quicksand of poverty and helplessness Tens of people live in a single room There are huge queues for rations And the danger of being run over by a local train, at any time They dread the new day even when they go to bed This is a hell of your making, Mr Tarneja At a press conference recently you said... prohibition ought to be imposed in the country But you have a distillery yourself. - Now look... l never said we must impose prohibition. All l said is that... the poor can't afford liquor. They shouldn't be drinking They get drunk and cause riots; beat up their wives and children Have you ever hit someone? - No... l don't drink, but... You hit someone recently. - No, not recently lt happened once, when l was crossing a road and there was this thug who was stealing money... Did you hit anyone at a park? - Won't you let me speak? ln the shrubs? Won't you let me speak? There was this blind man from whom a thug was stealing money... You were hiding behind a tree. - What nonsense are you talking? l don't answer such silly questions Why did l call this press conference? To be praised? To have nice things written about me, isn't it? Not to have people cross-examine me, did l? That's how journalists are nowadays. Bloody ingrates They ought to be drowned in the Arabian Sea or the Bay of Bengal! l think those two bastards have got to know about the incident at the Park Find an opportunity and... finish them We can't escape now. No way! Why did you open your mouth? ''ln the park, behind the trees and shrubs...'' our bodies are going to be found now. - Sudhir, whatever l do... l do after great deal of thought. Am l not the elder? Oh yes! And a fool too! Guess what l found at the site. - What? This one. - What is it? A cuff-link, we'd have been dead if it were lost But that cuff-link is with me. Here it is Where did you find it? - At the function lt's an identical one! One cuff-link we found at the park. The other, at the flyover Which means... from the park to the flyover Let's go. - No. We'll go there in the night Here... we were right here. - Where did you find the cuff-link? Here? Was it in this? The body must be in there. Let's see lt's so bloody heavy Give it a push Tarneja can't escape from us anymore. They're going to rot in prison They've spilt so much of blood Vinod, will we get a reward for this? Even if we don't, what difference does it make? Won't it be a reward when the newspapers expose Tarneja? Truth will triumph. And evil will be vanquished That's what l always say. We have the body. We have the pictures. We have all proof Where is the body? lt was right here How come...? Let's go. To the police station What are you doing here? What? - Nothing Nothing? Know what nothing means at this hour of the night? You were up to no good! To the police station. Come on We were only taking a walk and some fresh air Fresh air, or were you stealing? - Stealing? What can we steal here? ln fact, we're the ones who've lost. - What? lt's the... Skip the singing. Bloody clown Bring your face closer. Closer! Open your mouth What is your name? What? - Sudhir Mishra And yours? - Vinod Chopra Where do you live? - At Haji Ali What have you stolen? What? We've stolen nothing. You can search me What are you doing? - Shut up You dress like a hero and carry just a measly 50 paise coin Get lost. - That money's for our ticket We've got to go home. - Travel without a ticket. Get lost Get lost! Go away! Let's go. Without ticket. - We can't! lt's against the law Against the law? And how about what the cop did? That's the law lt's the law to snatch money from the hungry What Tarneja is doing is the law too But what people like us do is against the law l wish l could take a gun and... We can't do anything about it! - Why not? Why can't we? We have pictures of the murder and the body. We have all the proof We have no proof unless we find the body! Go to the police with the pictures and tell them that Tarneja has murdered Will they believe us? Won't they rather believe what Tarneja says? We'll be in trouble if we go go them. - Damn it! lt's all about money! Can't anyone do anything about it? ls there no one who can stop Tarneja? Have they given him a free hand? For all that he's doing, the law is fast asleep? What is it? Get lost. Go on There is a way. - What? lf these photos are published in a newspaper... this case will turn into a public issue Which newspaper? - We have Khabardar Shobha is bound to agree. After all... But we don't have the body. - We have the pictures of the body The photos can be published We have the pictures We'll say we've hidden the body somewhere Come on Come on Without ticket? - Yes Let's go But where could the body have gone? Now what's that? Who has parked that car right in the middle of the road? Hey mister! Good afternoon, wrestler! What's the problem? Looks like his car has stalled What...? What model is this? Sport? l drive an Austin A new model and it has stalled. What say? Let me check The radiator is okay. So is the carburetor What's up? Hey, you have a flat tyre? Are you sworn to silence, feller?

You have proved what stuff you are made of You did a great thing by not going to the police and came to me Publish the news immediately. - Of course, l will darling Now tell me where the body is The body... we have kept the body at a safe place We've hidden it. - Right. We've hidden it Nobody must get to know... especially not Tarneja You may go now. Leave it to me. l'll set everything right This is the editor of Khabardar. Shobha Singh l don't have the time to give stupid interviews No... don't disconnect. Or you will regret it What do you mean? l want to talk to you about Commissioner D'Mello But he's long dead Dead? Or killed? l can prove that he was killed And l also prove that you are the one who killed him What rubbish are you talking? l have a photograph in which you are seen firing at Mr D'Mello Photographs don't prove anything, Miss Shobha But the body will. And it's with me right now lf you can't believe me... you can check out the foundation slab under the flyover You have conned so many people. But you can't escape me l don't let people like you get away After all, we're all after the same thing in life What do you want? Not much. Only a million rupees lt can be negotiated When? - Tonight. Over dinner Where? - At my place l'm not coming alone. Vinod and Sudhir will come with me Dinner at Tarneja's place? - He's an enemy! Exactly. And that is precisely why We'll have to be very careful There are five more days to go before our next issue is out Think of the things Tarneja could do during these five days Especially when he gets to know that the body has disappeared Which is why l must extend a hand in friendship and distract him We have guests tonight, Ashok Make special arrangements.

The crash has spread panic among the residents of Bombay The Government has appointed an enquiry committee under Mr Kelkar... which will soon report its findings to the Government The flyover was built by Tarneja Constructions Corporation Our chief correspondent met its Chairman, Mr Tarneja What do you think is the reason behind the collapse of the bridge? The enquiry committee will tell us what was responsible But l left no stone unturned l've used the best of cement and imported construction material l'm sure Mr Kelkar, the chairman of the enquiry committee... will surely reach a conclusion very soon lf the fault lay in the construction, many buildings... in Bombay would have crashed already. - l'm not suspecting you. But... You know the answers, my friend. Think about it This bridge was made to collapse. lt's a conspiracy. Sabotage! Someone wants to defame me and have me black-listed Our correspondent met the constable... who was on duty at the bridge on the night the collapse occurred Were you on duty on the night the flyover collapsed? What do you mean? You say l was asleep? What's that...? What? - Moron! lt's a camera. You're on tv! Nothing happened, sir. l was on duty. - Are you sure nothing happened? Oh yes, l do... one moment That night, there were a couple of suspicious looking boys around What were they carrying? - No worries, sir l've noted down their address in my diary Look at this.

Don't worry, sir l'm a policeman of Bombay. l'll follow their trail l won't let them escape Vinod, even the cops are after us! And that's a good thing too that the bridge has collapsed! Just don't worry. l'll handle the police Tarneja's in a bind now! He can't escape from my clutches The two of us will destroy him now You guys are with me, aren't you? - What a thing to ask! We're all the way with you in teaching Tarneja a lesson What say? Didn't l say... Truth always triumphs. - And evil is vanquished l'm not waiting anymore. l'm publishing this issue tomorrow The artwork isn't ready. Blocks of the body's photos have yet to be made We have all the evidence to blast Tarneja The biggest of our evidence is the body which is with us Shobhaji, l wanted to say something to you... The post-mortem will prove that the bullets in D'Mello's body... were fired from Tarneja's pistol! - Listen to us, Shobhaji Go immediately and bring the body here to me Only he who has the body will win this battle Listen to me, Shobhaji... we don't have the body What? Whose photographs are these? - They're the body's, all right But the body later disappeared l get it The mention of a million makes you greedy What are you talking about? - You want your share, right?

There's no price for help, Shobhaji Skip the drama and tell me where you have hidden the body You're the one who's enacting a drama with us! Social service indeed!

Truth always prevails. And falsehood is vanquished Ashok is the spy Now we'll watch the fun! They're all going to be caught We might have a flourishing business And a big shop ''Truth shall prevail'' ''We shall overcome'' ''We shall overcome'' ''We have faith'' ''lmplicit faith'' ''We shall overcome'' ''We shall overcome'' ''We have faith'' ''lmplicit faith'' ''We shall overcome'' Forget it, friends
