Wow! That's a nice one. Maybe that one? That's the one I want! It's really nice. Albert...! Look at that nice dog! That's exactly what I want for my birthday. We have to hurry to the supermarket... ...before it gets dark, or we'll have nothing for dinner. - I was just going to. - "Just going to, just going to!" I've told you to ask permission before borrowing grandpa's telescope. But I saw such a nice dog. Of course you can use the telescope, but you have to ask first. It's a family treasure. Yeah, I was just going to. - But I was just going to. - "Just going to"... Daddy... Daddy... Aren't we going now? What? Don't we have to buy food before it gets dark? - Yes, I was just going to. - Now it's you who says it! Says what? "I was just going to", you said. Did I? Yes, so I did. How do we really know that a dog is a dog? They are so different. What kind of dog should I want? Albert, is there nothing else you might want? A fish, perhaps? How about a fish? Albert? - It's so nice! - He's friendly dog. Look at the sweet little dog, daddy! You're so little! There's a nice place for you to sit. He is a nice doggie... Good dog... good dog! But we must hurry, Albert. Bye bye! Bye bye! I think a bigger dog would suit me better. Maybe not that big. What sort of dog do you think I should have, Daddy? You're far too little to have your own dog. Maybe you can get one when you get bigger. No, look! There's Nurket, who you babysit for. - Hi, Nurket! - Albert! - Here I am, Albert! - Here are we. Whoop-de-do! Well, I'll go in and shop. Wait! I'm coming with you! What? Don't you want to play while I shop? No, I'm almost 7 years old, as a matter of fact. - You've got too big? - Yes. Then you can go shopping and I can stay here and play. No, people who are too big to play with the balls, don't eat lollies. Wouldn't you rather have dark chocolate? No, I'm not that big yet. - Hello there! - Good gracious! Long time no see. Look who it is! Hello there... Goodness, Albert, how big you've grown! You remember Gustav and Singoalla, Albert? We were neighbours. Sim sim sala bim! No, what do you have there? Can you do magic and conjuring?! Yes, Gustav can do both. Look, Albert... Singo wants to play with you. Is his name Singo? Hi, Singo! Come on, Singo. Look... here's the ball. Try and get it! Daddy, look... I got Singo to stand on his back legs! Don't you think Singo is nice? That's exactly the sort of dog I want. When I get my own dog, it will walk on its hind legs and do tricks. It will say hello, spin around, shake hands and everything. You mustn't walk around thinking about that dog all the time. There's a lot of responsibility needed in having a dog. You're too little. I'm not too little at all! You always say that. What? Do I? Yes... maybe I do. I'm always too small. Yes, always, always... too small... too small... Yes, Schubert... At least when you want a dog. Yes, especially then. Too small for such a big responsibility, says Daddy. Yes. Just too small. Tiny! Even if you're growing all the time and getting bigger... ...and have started school. Exactly. But it's the same at school. Do you hear me, Captain? Land crabs in sight. Over. All under control, skipper. Land crabs identified. - I want to play Pirates! - Me too! Come on! Hoist the Jolly Roger! Weigh anchor! What do you want? We want to join your game. You're only in first grade. You don't know the rules. - Yes, we do! - We can sword-fight with sticks, too. Sword-fight with sticks? Forget it! First-grade kids! Why can't we join in? You're too little. No, we're not! Forget about playing with Silly Signe. Silly Signe. That's what she is.... silly. Jokke and Peter are silly, too. Silly Jokke and Silly Peter. We are always just too small to get to join the game We're bossed around by big kids It really is a shame! Because you never get to play you never get a go But one day I shall prove to them I can be part of their fun show All I get is "Get out of the way" "Squirt, get out of here" "It's best you go away instead" "Your brain-power's much too low" Though I know more than they can tell they just don't want to know They say "Wait until you're big but until then, it's no" There are so many to choose from. - I want to see that one! - So do I. No, over here. This is the one we'll see. It's very funny. I know that I am little now but soon I'll be much bigger But everybody else grows too. What's big enough? Can't figure. That grown-ups always know what's best I don't believe is true They should listen to what we say. I think so, don't you? All I just get is "no, no, no" "you can't do it like that" "It's better that it's done like this" "One day you'll have it down pat" I know exactly what I want Why's that so hard to prove? They say "sit down, sit still" just when I'd like to move Daddy... Yes. In a week I have a birthday... And then I'll be a whole year older. And you said I could have a dog when I was older. So I'll be older then. I said that maybe you can have a dog when you're bigger. But mean a lot bigger than you are now. You always think I'm too small when there's something that's fun. Yes, maybe. But I'm not buying a dog for you now. I'll buy one with my own money. What money? With my pocket-money and savings. I'll stop buying my Saturday lollies. That's a good idea. Excellent! And I can ask for money as a birthday present. But it will take you a long, long time. And that's just fine, because you'll have time to grow big enough. I am big enough! You don't know anything. I'll save a lot faster than you think. That won't go very far. You need much, much more. This much. But what will you actually do with a dog? You've got me, haven't you? Well, stop now. Only toddlers have imaginary friends. Maybe you aren't as big as you think. I am so! Daddy doesn't think so. Nor Silly-Signe either. You're not big enough to play Pirates even once. I know... It's unfair. If only we could show them. Good morning. Come on sleepyhead... Up you get! Alright... I'll just... ...sleep a little longer. How awful it would be if Albert owned a dog. The poor dog wouldn't get to go out, because Albert was too tired. If I had a dog, I'd be up like a rocket! We're playing Pirates after school. Yeah... that's great. You'll never get it. The treasure's mine. Okay, then it's a duel. Out on deck! Swords drawn! A fight to the death! Winner takes all! Those first-class kids! Look what I've got! What is it? A pirate telescope! Wow! Show us? - Hurry up! - It's very high! - Come on! - Nearly there. Hi. Hello. Amazing! It looks like a real one! Want to borrow this? Wow! A walkie-talkie! Enemy definitely spotted. Over. Situation under control. Over. We'll hide inside! Enemies taken by surprise and captured. Over! Reinforcements on the way. Over and out. Oh! A big ship is coming. Look! They're firing at us. Help! We must defend ourselves! Can you see the ship? Oh, it's lovely. Can you see it? Hey, are you out running about? Look this way! It's Singo. It's our old neighbor's dog. Are you looking at dogs? No... But I have to go now. Can I borrow your telescope? No. It's very valuable. It's been in the family for over 100 years. It's a family heirloom. I don't believe you. Because then you wouldn't have been allowed to use it. Yes, I'm allowed. No! Wait! We're coming with you. Bye bye! This is Singo. He's the wizard's dog. - Hi, Singo. - What wizard? - Hi again, Albert. - Hi. That's him. The Wizard. Are you a wizard? It depends on how you think about it. You did magic tricks for me. Oh yes, of course. Show us, then! Do some magic for us. Yes! Please! Abra... cadabra... No! What do you have there? Here you are. Thanks! Where did it come from? Do you have one today too, Albert? Wow! How did you do it? Do magic on me too! Abra... cadabra. Only a 1-crown? Both the boys got 5 crowns. We'll have to try again. Hocus pocus... abracadabra.... 2, 3, 4 and 5. You can do real magic! Anyone who has sharp eyes could even see it. What can you see? Can we play with Singo? Yes, you can. As much as you want. Thanks. Come on, Singo! - More magic! - Not now. I can't anymore. - I have to rest. - Yes! Come on! These are such heavy carry-bags. We can help you with the carry-bags as thanks for the magic money. Would you? - The boys too, don't you think? - Yes, they'll want to. Thanks for the help. How kind you are. I can take Singo out every day after school. That would be great! You may get a crown for your trouble. Come on in, Albert. It's so nice to have visitors. Come along... in you go! These are witch doctor masks from Africa. I bought them when I was a sailor. - Have you been a sailor? - Yes. I've sailed on all the seven seas. I must say he has. - Are the masks magic? - Yes. The witch doctor thought so. Was it a witch doctor who taught you to do magic? I learned magic here and there when I was a sailor. I also want to be a sailor. But mostly, I want to be a pirate. Do you really? Yes, I can imagine that. Oh, I wish I had one of those! Then you can build one like me. How do you get it into the bottle? That's my little secret. With magic. Is that right? You could say that. It's a kind of magic. Does magic make it smaller? Just think about it. Are there any hungry children here? - There are rolls in the kitchen. - Yes! - Yum yum! - That's mine! We've no more juice left. So there's just water. But you can probably fix that, Gustav. Abracadabra, simsalabim... - Do you like raspberry juice? - The juice came! Eat now. - More magic! - Yes please! Now I've no more magic power. Next time I can do more magic. Bye bye, Singo! - He doesn't look like a wizard. - But he is one. How can you be sure of that? He looks quite normal. I know. They're like that. I'm reading a book about wizards and witches. They look quite ordinary. No one knows they can do magic. It's a top secret. I do not think it's that secret. They buy food like everyone else. They have a dog. I wonder if Singo is also magical. I wonder what he conjures up next time. Rabbits, maybe. Or birds. I've seen it on TV. Actually, I hope it will be more money. We know a real live wizard. Not many other kids do. If you look in the book, you see it, you do... that he is a wizard through and through We know a wizard who does magic tricks He really can do it He does it for kicks But is he real? Is it true? Just look in this book and it will show you We saw water changed to juice that's sweet Only a wizard could perform that feat Whatever you ask for, it's as good as done To have his powers would be such fun If he makes a mistake he can conjure again or conjure up help from a magician friend I thought wizards had castles on mountains steep or lived with bats in caverns deep But wizards can live in a house like yours with ordinary windows, lights and doors But if you go in, you'll have the pleasure to see lots of things that a king would treasure We know a wizard who can do magic tricks He can do proper magic, he does it for kicks He just waves his wand and in front of your eyes Your wish is fulfilled, oh, what a surprise! We know a wizard who can do magic tricks He can do proper magic, he does it for kicks He just waves his wand and in front of your eyes Your wish is fulfilled, oh, what a surprise! Old Gustav is not a wizard. But he can trick you. He made it look like the money came out of your nose. - No one can do real magic. - He can. I saw it myself. Maybe he's the one who made my grandfather's telescope disappear. Or do you know where it is, Albert? It's in my backpack. I wanted to show it to Viktor and Milla. You're supposed to ask permission before you borrow it. I didn't think you'd notice that it was gone. I was going to put it back. That's not the point. I forgot. When you make a promise, you have to keep it. Do you understand now why I say you're not big enough to have a dog? - I'll never do it again. - Good. I'll be the biggest boy in the world. I'll be quite happy when you're big enough. Hi there, Albert! - Is the wizard home? - No, Gustav... The wizard is not home. He's at the doctor's. He said I could walk with Singo. That was a good idea. Of course you can. Hey, wait on! Once I've bought my own dog, you can play together. I don't have much money yet. But soon. The wizard has promised me money every time I walk with you. And I've asked for money as a birthday present. Got it in! I can help Daddy wash windows and a lot of other things. I can babysit for Nurket. It's going to be great. And then we'll come and visit you. My dog ​​will probably be bigger than you. But he'll be a nice dog. And black. Or brown, maybe? - Is that your dog, Albert? - Yes. I'm getting a dog too. A much bigger dog. Not such a silly lapdog. - Do you have the telescope with you? - No, it's at home. I don't believe you. We want to borrow it. Now! Get it! Run for your life! - It's chasing us! - Me first! Pull the ladder up! You're not a silly lapdog. Singo! Wait! Singo! Hello there, Singo. And hello to you, Albert. Singoalla said I could take him for a walk. We agreed on that. Singo and you have become such good friends. Speaking of friends, look who's coming here. Hi there, kids! It'll have to be a magic show, as I promised. Yes! Here I have my magic things. - Magic what? - Hush! Magic elements. I just want to understand what he's doing. He waves his wand and tosses his hat so it flies round the room like a terrified bat Abracadabra, it flits all around but then back it comes without touching the ground Voila! Now we shall show you some magic with pride for look at this hat there's nothing inside But what have we here? A lovely bouquet has come from the hat to the clear light of day Wait now! Here, from our house, he's holding the key If it gets lost, he's as mad as can be Somehow the key's gone like a rocket across the room into Milla's pocket Mine? Watch! It's raining lollies! So many sweets! - Who wants to jump in the box? - Yes now I'm excited! Applause for Singo, my magic assistant. It's like the dog has disappeared without a trace. Where's Singo? There you were! I was supposed to conjure Singo out of the box again. But I've conjured up something else instead. I really think it's a gift to the future sailor, Viktor. To me? Oh, thank you! Do you want a ship in a bottle? No. Think of something for next time. That would be fair. First, Albert will be paid for walking with Singo today. Abracadabra, simsalabim... - There you are. - Thank you. Soon I'll have earned enough for my own dog. I have to go for a walk with Singo every day. I think there's more money left up in my nose. Do you think so? Abradadabra hocus pocus... I don't think so. Are you up already? - It's Saturday. - I'm going for a walk with Singo. But it's raining. Dogs have to go out anyway. Yes... yes, of course. I understand. Daddy... If something disappears and then comes back... ...where has it been while it was gone? - Have you lost anything, Albert? - No, when something is conjured away. - What did Gustav conjure away? - Singo. First he was in a box. Then the wizard conjured him away. And then he came back again, from under the table. Gustav just made you believe that Singo was gone. Singo was, of course, under the table all the time. Even if you didn't see him. Do you remember that time you banged your forehead? The flagpole was there even if you didn't see it. Do you know why you don't believe in magic? Because it does not exist? Because no one has conjured money out of your nose. Goodness, what a dirty dog! You need a bath. Well done, Albert! Where did he go then? Now I've got you! Dinner time, Singo! Come and eat. No you don't! Don't be afraid, Singo. It's just like lots of rain. Just like a big puddle. There you go. Into the bath you go... Just like a puddle. Oh you're getting so clean and pretty. Thanks for the help with dog-walking and bathing. Hocus pocus... There you are. You've earned it. - Here are your wages. - Thanks. - Buy yourself something extra good. - I'm saving for something special. Something I really want. Can you conjure up big money too? Banknotes and stuff? - Do you think you got too little? - No. I was just wondering... It's not harder to conjure banknotes than coins, out of noses and ears. In here, there is great value. Could you conjure me up some money too? I'm going out shopping. Hocus pocus... I don't need that much. Now I have to rest a bit. But come on back with the others tomorrow. I'm going home now. So much money was inside my head? Maybe thought-money can be conjured into real money. I reckon it can. He said that there was even more inside here. It's actually my money. 14, 15, 16, 17... ...18, 19... Albert, where in the world did you get that money from? The wizard conjured them from my ears. There's a lot more in here. Tomorrow I'll ask him to conjure up even more money. Now I'll soon have enough for a dog. - But that's real money. - I was the one who thought it up. Did he really give you all that money? Have you taken it? You must return it immediately. No. I'll buy a dog with it. Even if you think the money's magic, you can't just take it. It's the same as stealing. I didn't steal. No, I realise that. But anyway, you have to give it back. - Do you want me to come with you? - No. But you go and do it right away, right? - Come on. He's not with the dog. - Coming. Where's the telescope? - Hand it over! - It's at home. I don't believe you. Got to see. - No! - What's this? The wizard conjured it out of my ears. Out of your ears? Which wizard? Isn't this real money? Magic money is super good in the treasure chest. - That's it. We'll borrow it. - No! Give it back! - If we can borrow the telescope, then. - No. No. Come back! - Give me my money. - Hurry. Give me my money! Only if we get the telescope. No, I'll get the wizard to conjure up new money. - Albert, there have been thieves here! - What? I must have put it away somewhere. - We can't find our money. - Can't you conjure up more? We can help you and think up a lot of money... all of us! Then you can conjure it out. No, that won't work. Money is special. It's forbidden to make it yourself. A person could go to jail for that. So you can only conjure up money that you already have. And one must make oneself deserving of money. Doesn't Singo need to go out? We forgot that poor Singo needs to go out for a walk. You are so good and responsible, Albert. - We have to fix up the tree-house. - Yes, there are some loose planks. Then it's up with the toolbox. - I need the saw when you're done? - Can I have the hammer then? Wait here, otherwise Signe won't dare to come down. Hey, I've got the telescope. - Great! - I can go down. No! I'll go. Give me the money. We've not finished playing yet. We'll borrow both the money and the telescope. You said I'd get my money back. I've changed my mind. - I don't understand. - It's disappeared without a trace. - Under here, maybe? - They must be here somewhere. I must have put it away somewhere else. Is it in the hat, I wonder? No, not there either. Maybe they're in the box anyway. Well thought out, Albert. One can never know. Maybe they're back... No. They're still gone. Now that's enough of that. It has to be pleasant when the kids are visiting. Very true! I promised to conjure up something nice for Albert and Milla. Have you figured out what you want? I wanted money. But it doesn't work. - What can you really conjure? - I want to learn to conjure. Then you have come to the right place. First you take your spells... and then you say... Abracadabra hocus pocus... Abracadabra hocus pocus... Look, Gustav! You've put the money in the hat instead of in the chest. Next time, take the box on your head, instead of the hat. No! It was me. I conjured it up! No. There was no magic. It was me who... I looked down at my hat. And then they weren't there. Well then, there must have been magic. Don't be sorry, Albert. I understand what happened. It was my fault. - It's forbidden to conjure money. - That's quite right. - Am I going to jail now? - Heavens no! You just conjured up money which already existed. - I can do magic. You saw it. - So show us now then. Abracadabra hocus pocus... You can't conjure! I need to have the wizard's spells. - He can conjure without spells. - Yes, he's used to it. Or... he's just kidding us. - He conjured up a ship in a bottle. - But he'd built it himself. Yes, but isn't that magic? I have to practice a lot. Double, double, toil and trouble. Simsala bimble... Fibble, fabble, fiddle de de... Hey, Albert. How did it go? Was Gustav happy with his money? What did he say about you taking it? Nothing. - Did he say nothing? - Yes. He said it was his fault. Did he really?! That it was his fault? Well, well. It will take forever before you have enough money for your own dog. - I know. - Maybe you never get your own dog. Shut up. Too bad it's banned for the wizard to conjure up money. Maybe he can't do magic at all. Of course he can. How do you know that? Do you remember the wizard on TV? He conjured rabbits out of his hat. The wizard may conjure up a dog for you. - Do you think so? - Dead-set sure. Ask him, and you'll see. - Where are you going? - Out. Not for long... It's getting dark soon. Albert? Hello. What are you doing here so late? Can you... conjure up a dog for me? I really want a little dog I can play with and cuddle. What? A dog? Yes. It doesn't have to be big. Like this, maybe? Or like that? - Is that okay? - I can manage such a dog. - And it's not forbidden? - No, no, it's not forbidden. Come back tomorrow, then we'll fix it, you'll see. I don't want a dog for a birthday present anymore. And not money either. I want a dog collar. And maybe a rubber bone to play with. What have you come up with now, Albert? Can I take the big box in the closet? If it is empty. The wizard will conjure up my very own dog for me, today. It's not forbidden. Wow! Can't wait! Hocus...pocus...filiocus! That's a little one! Oh no. Look here... See how much fun it can be. I thought you could conjure up properly. I thought you should conjure up a real dog. A real dog? That's not possible. I have to go home now. Bye bye. Now you've messed up completely, Gustav. A life that is empty of magic at all is so really sad that you begin to pall When no one can conjure conjure something for me everyday life is not where I can be The world was so magic yet so hard to vet but too it was funny and all I could get No one, no no one can conjure for me everyday life is not where I can be everyday life is not where I can be everyday life stay far away from me for where have the fantasies gone? Today everything went so wrong All there are are regular folk like Viktor and Milla and me Ordinary everyday stay away from me Are you home already? Aren't you at the wizard's today? I long and I long, I long till I'm blue There isn't a wizard that I know is true For no one, no no one can conjure for me So sad that there are just ordinary people. Only ordinary ones... Like Silly-Signe. Daddy. And you. And no wizards who can conjure up for real. Get on your way! You don't exist either, do you. Everyone has to cry a bit sometimes. Grown-ups must, too. - Is there something wrong? - Close the door! We'll be eating soon. Do you want some food? No. There are no wizards. There's no one in the world who can do real magic. No, that's true. But there are some who can do it so it looks like magic. That can be pretty cool. There's no point, when it's just fake. I'll never go to the wizard anymore. That's a shame. But there are other things that are fun to do. It's only two days till your birthday. There's no point with that either. You think I'm too little, even if I get older. That's Singo! What a nice dog! Well, well! It's Albert! So nice to see you. Hi, Gustav. Or do I address you as Wizard? I don't know about "Wizard" now. Yesterday, the magic failed. I understand that you're disappointed. But can't you visit us again? At least for Singo's sake. Yes... maybe. Albert is so good, helping us by walking Singo. Yes, he is. He's a big, responsible boy. Absolutely. Big and responsible. Can I take Singo for a walk in the park? Yes, that's fine. Then your dad and I can get to talk for a bit. Those two have truly become good friends. Are you brave enough to say that you want your telescope back? I don't know. Ask the wizard to conjure it back for you. He's sitting over there. No, Schubert. It doesn't work. The telescope can't be conjured back. This is something I have to do myself. He's coming up here. - What are you going to do? - I have to get my telescope. Too bad. We're not done with it. You can't borrow it any longer. It's not mine. It's my dad's. I'm not allowed to play with it. I took it without permission. Just so I could join your games. Did you get into trouble? Daddy doesn't know I took it, yet. He's going to get real angry if he discovers it. - OK then. - Thanks. And by the way, Singo is not my dog ​​either. Why did you say that then? It was just something I said. I don't have a dog. Not me either... I just said that. But I want one! Not me. I don't like dogs. You shouldn't be afraid of them. Dogs are very friendly when you know them. Here's your grandpa's telescope. But Albert! Did you take the telescope again? After our last talk? I was just going to... Sorry. I borrowed it again without asking. But here it is. Oh well. Thank you for letting me know. I didn't know it was gone. Sometimes you think that something exists... even if it doesn't. That's true. Yes, there you are on the trail of one of the great secrets of magic. You're a wise little boy. Gustav means, of course, that you're a wise, big boy. It's okay to be small. You become big anyway in the end. Yes, we're all getting older. Some get big fast, it seems. Gustav is a good and sensible man. But he's not a wizard. He can not conjure for real. It's just trickery. Don't say that... You never can tell. You always say that what looks like magic is trickery. But sometimes reality can look like magic. I have to save for a dog, even if it takes a long time. That it will. But not as long as it takes for you to understand... ...that I'm big enough to look after a dog. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday dear Albert, Happy birthday to you Hip hip hooray! Look at that cake! - Blow them out. - Well done, Albert! And now we want to give Albert a present. Hocus pocus, happy birthday, Albert. Yes, Albert. Happy birthday. Singo! Will Singo be mine? You see, Singoalla and I are getting a little too old... ...to take care of Singo properly. He needs someone with younger, faster legs. - Can he live here with me? - Yes, Albert. We've decided you're responsible enough for your own dog. This is real magic. Thank you, Daddy. And thank you, Wizard. And thank you, Singoalla. Our pleasure, Albert. Call me Gustav. Not Wizard. - You must come often and visit us. - Every day. You must all come. Then the wizard... I mean Gustav, can conjure for us. Now we have another magician here with nice, young fingers. Abracadabra... hocus pocus... Bravo! - Happy birthday. - Thanks. Where are you? There he is... under the table. What are you doing there, Singo? - Happy birthday, Albert. - Happy birthday, Schubert. Maybe Singo wants some cake? No. Singo has to have bones. Soda too? Yes. - Birthday soda for Singo! - Dog soda. Birthday burp! Subtitles by FatPlank
