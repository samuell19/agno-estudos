I think you should buy another ticket. It would be the best solution for you. - Thanks! - You're welcome. - Destination? - New York. Exit 2. The flight is boarding in twenty minutes. It is non-stop, right? Yes. It will land in New York in seven hours. Can I change my ticket? I'd like to stop in Barcelona. One moment. There's an Iberia flight in one hour. It will arrive in Barcelona at 11:20. Do you want me to change your ticket? Yes, please change it. Your water, miss. Miss? Here's your water. Thank you. Attention, please. To all passengers, please fasten your seat belts and observe the no smoking sign. We'll be landing at the airport in Barcelona in a few minutes. Thank you. Welcome to Barcelona! Three million inhabitants, second city in Spain and the capital of Catalonia! It's known as the pearl of the Mediterranean, with good reason! It's so beautiful! Valencia to Barcelona in five hours. How do you like old Martinez? Let's hear it for Martinez! Stop or I'll get emotional and forget everything! This is the historic town centre, you can see the Palau Nacional... ...and the Plaza de Toros. Not something you see everyday back home, right? What a strange tower. Do you like it? See? That's where I went to school. It's a bank now. Stop it, Robby, I've had enough. Your house has been turned into a hotel... ...your playground has been turned into a parking lot... ...you've been bothering me since we left. Why can't you be less trite? Look! Well, I thought you'd have liked to see where I lived. Sure... You can see the Gothic Quarter on the left. On the right you can see the Cathedral of Santa Eulalia. You're always sitting alone, Father Bronson. Why don't you join us? We could have a little chat together! Thanks, I'd love to. I'll join you in a little while! - Can you see better now, dear? - Yes! That statue depicts Christopher Columbus. Some people say he was Italian, but I guarantee you that's a lie! Listen to old Martinez, people: Columbus was Spanish, definitely Spanish! - Is it true? - I don't know. What do you say, Ms. Stone? Whatever he was, he should have gone another way. - It wasn't a big discovery. - Why is that so? Here we are! - Your key, Mr. Hamilton. And yours. - Thanks. - Good morning. - Good morning to you. Hold the oranges. Room 19. One more thing, Ms. Stone. Someone called you from Paris this morning. - Paris? Are you sure? - Of course I am. I've answered it myself and said that you weren't expected till early afternoon. - Did you get a name? - Sorry. I only spoke with the operator. Good morning. Don't forget Peggy's deodorant. Peggy! What happened? You've got an hour to freshen up, we're going to the Ramblas! - Mom, look! It's beautiful! - Not bad, but don't stop. - Are you having fun? - We are. Have you seen my granddaughter? - I don't think so. - If you do, tell her I'm looking for her. I will, but don't get too worried, Jenny's not a child anymore. Exactly, that's why I'm so worried. See you later, father. Excuse me, have you seen a young American girl with dark hair and light eyes? No, I'm sorry. Thanks anyway. Hold that pose, Naiba, and give me a smile. Do you like chrysanthemums, Lisa? What a silly question. You know they're the flowers of death. Hold it. Good. - Come on... - Stop, there's too many people. Bye! See you tonight. Is it yours? God! Paulette! Let's get out of here. Mark! What are you doing here? I can't tell you now. - What happened? - That poor girl! Quick, let's go! - We must do something! - Call the police! God, I'll never forget the vision of that poor girl's eye socket. The other one looked as if it was staring at me. It's horrible. Try not to think about it. Here, drink. A little better? Why did you come, Mark? Why do you want to complicate things? When we were in Paris, me and Alma did nothing but argue. So, when the conference ended, I decided not to go back to America with her. I told Alma I'd join her in a few days but I came here instead. I wanted to see you again. I wanted to be with you. Not under these conditions, Mark. I already told you. I want to compete with your wife on an equal basis. I don't want to take advantage of your situation. I'd feel terrible. We'll have this conversation again when she'll recover from her illness. I can wait. That's not true and you know it. The first time was a mistake that won't happen again. I don't want to be your mistress. To work for you and to be in love with you is difficult enough. Try to understand. Besides, I hate making compromises. Stop saying that, it's just a matter of time. Alma didn't go back to Burlington. I've convinced her to undergo deep sleep therapy in a New York clinic. She had a nervous breakdown. I'll tell her the truth once she gets better. She'll realize that divorce is our only solution. What are you going to do now? Stay here with you. There's going to be a lot of gossip. All the others are from Burlington. So what? Don't you like taking risks? It's my last week as a policeman. Eight days from now I'll stop chasing criminals to start fishing trouts. I've been waiting years for this. You can't wait to take over, huh? Well, inspector, I can't deny that. When I was your age I was chasing small-time crooks. It was a different time, of course. I had to learn everything on my own. No police academies back then. What can you tell me about your men? One thing at a time. There's still a week to go. That can be quite a long time, young man. Hello? Yes, it's me. Where did it happen? The Ramblas? I see. I'll be right there. Actually, we'll be right there. Did you ever witness an autopsy during your training? The blade entered the abdomen several times from different angles. The blows were inflicted with great violence. The liver was greatly lacerated, while the lungs presented more superficial wounds. What I don't understand is the mutilation of the left eye. I guess the killer wanted to torture the victim. Excuse me, doctor. Are you saying we're dealing with a sadist? Yes, I wouldn't rule it out. What kind of weapon was it? A navaja knife, I'd say. Or something similar like a long, double-edged blade. What about the victim? Her name was Pepita Barreiro. She was 18. Her father owns a flower shop on the Ramblas. It's very close to where the victim was killed. No witnesses? No one except for a priest who claims he heard her screams. Where is he now? If only I had arrived earlier, I might have saved her. You can't imagine how worried I was, Jenny wandered off without saying anything. When I heard that poor girl screaming, for a moment I thought that... Stop that. Lisa, look. Who's coming? I'd like you to meet Mark Burton, the president of the company I work for. We bumped into each other this morning. What a small world. You can sit down here. I can go to the next table, there's an empty seat. Don't worry, father. Me and my secretary can sit at another table. No worries at all, Mr. Burton. Please sit down. Please. Are you from Burlington, too? Well, not exactly. I've been living there since I became president of Murray & Sons. So, what do you do? Promotion. And what does that mean? Publicity. - I'll give you an example. - Let's see. You know the prizes and free gifts you can find in boxes of detergents sold in stores? That's part of what promotion means. Yeah, I recognize him now, that's Mark Burton! I went to school with his wife and I see her all the time in Burlington! Poor Alma, she wouldn't like to see her husband fooling around with that girl. What do you mean, Mrs. Alvarado? Ms. Stone is just his secretary. Is that so, father? - Come on. - How much longer do we have to wait? A gift for you, miss. This is the Tibidabo, the highest point in Barcelona. What's the point of going to an amusement park when it rains? There's no point, but you can't change the itinerary, right? Did you get that? She's always complaining. I think I agree with your granddaughter. There's no point. I guess Mr. Burton agrees with your two. He didn't show up. He had some business to attend to but he'll join us later. Are we still doing the photo shoot? - Yes, of course. - With this rain? It might stop. Here you go. On the house. - Here. - Thanks! You're too kind! - Mr. Hamilton. - Thanks. - Miss Jenny. - They look so nice! Hurry up, Jenny! - Let's go! - Wait for me! Quick! I think it's stopped raining. - Peggy, have you seen Martinez? - Yes, he was over there. I'm gonna find him. I'm out of film and I think he's got more on the bus. Let's go to the haunted tunnel! It'll be fun! Yeah! - You go, I want to get a roll of film. - All right! - Come on, let's go! - Yeah! My God, look! - Where's my daughter? - What happened? - Don't let her see! - Right! What have they done to my daughter? Let me see her! Let go of me! I want to see her! Peggy! Peggy! Two murders with the same modus operandi. We haven't found it yet, but we're also sure that the killer used the same weapon. There's one more thing. You're all connected to both cases. Either the killer is targeting your group... ...or the culprit is here. That's absurd! We're all from Burlington and we've known each other for years! He's right, inspector. There are no monsters among us. Of course! The killer is probably some maniac, or a boozer! Something similar happened in Burlington, too. You remember that, father? One year ago, a maniac killed a girl near the railway. I remember. They got him fast. He was a beggar, a real nutcase. Try to calm down, Mr. Hamilton. No one's accusing you. You're innocent. This was found in the victim's hand. Is this yours? Yes, it is. I lost it yesterday in the dining room. It's a lie! He had it this morning, when we were on the bus! That's not true! He was always pranking all of us, including Peggy! He loved to scare us and got a kick out of making people scream! I didn't do anything! I told you I lost the spider yesterday! And now you're losing your head. You're coming with us. - Inspector Lara. - Bring him in? Yes. Enjoy the rest of the evening. Are you travelling with this group? This is inspector Tudela. He's investigating Peggy's death. My name is Mark Burton. She's my secretary. I'm in town for business. I see. Keep yourself available, I might have to ask you some questions. What is it? Why don't you take your clothes off? Don't you wanna get into bed? Leave me alone. I don't feel like it tonight. Yeah, I understand how you feel. It's a horrible tragedy. But you don't have to get mad at me. You think I didn't notice how nice you were with Peggy? You never missed a chance to talk, caress or embrace her! - Don't be silly. - You liked her, don't deny it. I wouldn't be surprised if she refused you and... Come on, spill it. Where were you when Peggy was killed? Tell me! Enough! Forgive me, Naiba. Stop crying. Please. Forgive me, I didn't mean it. Come on, stop crying. Please. This holiday has turned into a nightmare. I want to go home, Robby. I can't take it anymore. The killer has been arrested. There is nothing to fear. What if they got the wrong guy, huh? There's one thing I know, dear. I've planned this trip for years and I won't leave until... ...I visit the place where I was wounded during the war. - Wounded, you say? - During a bombing. I told you that. - Where did they hit you? - On the back of my neck. Gail, you cannot believe that... I'm sorry to bother you, Mr. Hamilton. My wife isn't feeling well and... ...I was wondering if Jenny might have a tranquilizer for her. Yes, we have some. Please, come inside. I was having a shave. - Hello? - New York's on the line. Speak up, please. St. George clinic. I'd like to speak to Mrs. Alma Burton. I'm her husband. One moment, please. I'm sorry, she's not here. She was due here on July 12 but she never arrived. - Hello, did you hear me? - Yes. Thank you. Alma never went to the clinic. - Yes? - Everything fine with your call, sir? Yes, thank you. Miss, could you connect me with Burlington, Vermont, please? Number, please. Two, three, four... ...six, two, five and one. Hold on, please. I'll dial directly. What does this mean? Why isn't she at the clinic? I don't know. I've got a dial tone. I'm sorry, nobody is picking up. Thank you. That's strange, she's not home either. Why are you so worried? She probably changed her mind about the clinic. And she's not home right now. What's strange about that? - I hope you're right. - What's worrying you? Nothing. Some weird thoughts... I'm sorry, but I don't feel like talking about it. Hey, you! Wait a sec! What are you looking for? Who are you? Quick, tell me! Come on, tell me! What happened, Paco? Who's that guy? Pepita's killer! Call the police! Mr. Burton! Mr. Burton! I'm so lucky I ran into you. The hotel received an urgent call for you while we were eating breakfast. Here's the message. I wrote it down because your secretary had left. 9.45, your wife called. She is waiting at the Hotel Presidente, room 108. Thanks, father. See you later! Thank you. Mrs. Alma Burton, please. Room 108. There must be a mistake, sir. The guest in room 108 is Ms. Foster. I'm sorry. Maybe you got the wrong hotel. Oh, how silly of me. Burton is her maiden name. - Would you announce me? - Your name, sir? Her husband. In that case, you can go right up. Third floor, the elevator is on the right. Thank you. Alma? Hello? Hello? The group is meeting at the Montjuïc Castle. Are you coming? Maybe. I don't know. What's the matter? You're acting so strange. Please, Paulette. Don't ask me questions, at least not for the moment. I'll tell you later, at the right time. See? You're admitting that you're hiding something from me. Why don't you confide in me? I know this is a bad time for you. I could help you, but only if you don't consider me a stranger. At least you could tell me where you spent the whole morning. Was it so important to leave me alone without a word? That's enough! Stop asking me questions! I told you there's nothing to explain! Such a lovely day. - You work too much. Here. - No! No! You hungry? Eat up. - Have you seen Mr. Hamilton? - No, I'm the first one here. You go ahead, I'm waiting for my husband. I'll tell Hamilton you're looking for him. Thanks. What happened? Tell us! Another murdered girl. Robby, what happened to you? - So, Mr. Alvarado... - I already told you! She was washing clothes at the fountain. She wore a miniskirt. I said something and tried to touch her. I admit my mistake. She got mad and started scratching me. And, coincidentally, right after that she disappears. Moreover, no one around here has seen her or knows who she is. Tell me, does it seem normal to you? I've had enough of this. Arrest me if you want. But at least tell me my motivation behind gouging out that poor girl's eye... ...and behind killing Peggy and the first victim. That's absurd! Maybe. We still got to prove who scratched you. We'll see. Hold on, inspector. Look at all that mud. The killer's shoes must be dirty. That's probable. A little while ago, Paulette was washing her shoes in a fountain. They were covered with mud, just like Inspector Lara's. What shoes is she talking about? These. It was hot so I decided to put on another pair. And you washed the first pair in the fountain? Yes, I didn't want to put a pair of dirty shoes in my bag. Inspector, I think we should send them to the lab to check the traces of mud. Don't you think so? You see, Inspector Lara, all shoes here are covered with dirt... ...and if Ms. Stone washed hers it's obvious that we will find mud traces. Don't you think so? Inspector, none of us could have murdered those girls. The killer isn't among us. I'm sure of it. How can you be so sure? Good morning. I'd like to talk to Ms. Foster. - I'm sorry, she left an hour ago. - What? Are you sure about that? She said she had urgent business in New York. I booked her flight myself. - What flight? - The Pan American flight at 5.55. - You're her husband, right? - Yes, why? Ms. Foster left this in her room. Thanks! Excuse me, what is the gate for the New York flight? - Gate 3. - That one? Yes. Attention, please. Ms. Foster, travelling on flight 320 to New York... ...please proceed to Gate 3. I repeat, Ms. Foster, please proceed to Gate 3. Yes, all right. Very well. You're welcome. Excuse me, what about Ms. Foster? She has canceled her flight. - When? - I just talked to her on the phone. - Do you know where she was calling from? - She didn't say, sorry. Thank you. Mark! - You leaving too? - I'm seeing the Randalls off. First class. Non-stop flight, if available. Those poor people. I feel so sorry for them. Right. Lisa, could you take a look at this? You're really photogenic. Don't look at me. Take a good look at the woman. - Who is she? - That's not important. Just tell me if you're willing to help me. Yes, but I don't understand. Listen, I know this is a weird request, but I've gotta try anyway. You're a professional photographer, after all. I'm sorry, but I just don't understand. Look at the woman, remember her face. Better yet, keep the picture. Now listen to me. This woman is in Barcelona. If you should meet her on the street, you must take her picture. I can't tell you more at the moment. Do you think I could see her? There's a chance that she might come to our hotel. Will you help me? You must not tell anyone. Has it something to do with the murders? Where have you been all day? Don't worry, I can assure you I was not staring at young girls. Where did you get this? My hairdresser, I suppose. These matches are from the Hotel Presidente. What were you doing there? One of the best hairdressers in town works there. I had my hair done there. Get out of here and remember what I told you! Don't worry, I'll keep my eyes open for suspects! I even understand English! - You can count on me, inspector! - Go. - Thank you! - Get out. It was a mistake to arrest him. Just say it if that's what you're thinking. - That's not what I... - But that's what I think. The left eye. There must be a meaning, don't you think, inspector? Even the craziest of killers follows some sort of logic. No matter how absurd or insane, there's always a logic. If we find the reason behind the mutilations, we... ...we'll nail the culprit! Is that what they taught you in the academy? You better keep searching for the murder weapon. The chief is furious, the American consulate is pressuring him for results. Why don't we ask the consulate to give us some details on the group? - We could find something useful. - Already done. Already done. I spoke yesterday with Mr. Williams, the secretary at the consulate. - I know you think I'm just an old fart. - Inspector, I... You keep investigating. You know, I'm in this situation... ...just because this maniac started his killing spree a week before my retirement. Come in. - Am I disturbing you? - Quite the contrary. Why are you avoiding me, then? I don't want to start arguing like yesterday. You're right. I'm sorry. We're all so nervous and, much worse, we've even begun to hate each other... ...and to suspect each other. - Are you talking about Mrs. Alvarado? - And myself as well. I wish I had never come here, believe me. I would like to be a million miles away from here. To be in Burlington. Listen. Do you remember what happened a year ago near my home in Burlington? I do. Hamilton was mentioning it the other night. The victim, Terry Moore, was killed in the same way. Yes, it happened near the railway, if I'm not mistaken. Did you know her? No. These things happen everywhere, but in that case they got the killer immediately. I think he was a beggar and an alcoholic. That man killed himself before they arrested him! Listen to me, Paulette, and don't interrupt me. I know that he was innocent. My relationship with Alma had already become troubled... ...even though there was nothing yet between you and me. She had a total nervous breakdown. She knew she couldn't have children and it made her more and more jealous. She had hysterical fits and she was always fainting. I don't know if you remember. I was often out of the office, back then. I went home earlier that day. The news of the murder just got out. They were looking for the killer. I was driving a Pontiac Sedan then, remember? I parked in my driveway, as usual. I was about to open the garage door when, by the pool, I saw... ...Alma. She was unconscious. As I got closer, I noticed that her hand was holding a dagger covered in blood. It's true, it was a dagger covered in blood. And, next to her, a soft, vitreous lump. It felt like a nightmare. I remember I cleaned the blade and put it back in a drawer in my study. Then I dragged Alma to her room. It was 2 in the afternoon and the murder had been discovered a half-hour earlier... ...about a hundred metres down the road. No, it's too crazy! Besides, Alma has gone back to America! She hasn't. Alma is here in Barcelona. - Have you seen her? - Not yet, but I'm sure she's here. Hello? Yes, I'll be right down. Thanks. I have to go to the consulate immediately. Give me till tomorrow morning and I'll explain everything. All right? All right, Mark. I'd also stay away from Ms. Alvarado, if I were you. Come on, Lisa. Let's dance. I have a headache, and I don't think we should dance. I've never asked for anything, you could make me happy once in a while! Now listen, Naiba. You wanted to come here tonight and here we are... ...so please stop being so difficult! I just don't get how you can think about having fun after what happened! So? Should we lock ourselves in our room and wait for the killer to strike again? You can leave if you want. I'm perfectly able to make it back on my own. And stop patronizing me! Naiba, is that you? I'll be right with you. Just let me develop this film. Lisa? Are you still angry with me? Can I come in? I want to explain... Gail? Where are you? Gail? Gail? Have you seen my granddaughter? No, I can't find my wife. What's going on? I have no idea. I heard a scream. - What happened? - Lisa Sanders has been murdered! Call the police! Please, stay calm. Robby! There's someone in the garden, hiding in the bushes! - Are you sure? - Yes. Call the police! Hurry! This way! Look! Blood. Here. No one goes near her, understand? Don't worry. She'll be under heavy security. So, you were reading in your room when you heard Ms. Naiba scream. Exactly. And I dashed out. - Their door was open and... - Did you see anyone in the corridor? - No. - Did you see anything unusual in the room? No, nothing in particular. Could you please retrace your steps? Unlike Robby, I couldn't sleep. Without waking him, I went out in the garden to smoke a cigarette. I was on my way back when I saw someone running out of the back door. Did you recognize this person? I don't know, it happened so fast. And it was too dark. It looked like a red cat that sprinted in front of me. It disappeared into the trees. That's all. A red cat, you say? I see. What about you, miss? What were you doing in the garden so late? Wait a minute. You can't think that... I think about a lot of things. Right now, I'm not thinking about anything. I'm just asking questions. Come on. Answer me. I sneaked out to go to a club near the hotel. I see. Could you please put this on? - You cannot... - Give me a hand. Excuse me, inspector, I know it's not my business but... ...that's one of the raincoats I gave to all passengers last Monday. Explain. It was raining. The company gives me about 50 of them for every tour. They're all the same size. You've all got one, then? I threw mine away when it stopped raining. I don't have mine either. I must have lost it. What about yours? I never had one. I didn't go to the amusement park with the others. I met them later. I left mine on the bus. Here's mine, inspector. Arpege! Arpege? Yes, I recognize it. It's Paulette's perfume! It's nonsense! - Don't listen to her! - Why? It's pretty simple. Ms. Stone used it on Peggy's mother to make her regain consciousness. I accidentally bumped into her and spilled the perfume all over the raincoats. That's all for now. I'm sorry but we're going to revoke your passports. You are not allowed to leave Spain until this case is solved. Don't you feel well? It's too depressing. I couldn't take it anymore. I can't get over the concept of death. It's not just that, there's something else. Something you're trying to hide. Come on, tell me. Why did you lie to me? Don't accuse me. But you lied to me about that girl who was murdered in Burlington. Terry Moore. How could you not have known her? She was the daughter of Dr. Moore. He was your family doctor. She lived down the street from you. All right. I might have seen her a few times. But I knew her like I know the milkman or the traffic cop on the street corner... ...or the clerk in the drugstore! Please, be reasonable. It's a whole lot of nonsense. Okay. Let's stop talking about it. Any news about Alma? Did you try calling her again? Shall we go back to the hotel, Jenny? Or would you like to take some sun? Yeah. Any news, inspector? Your friend is still in shock. The doctor wants her to stay at the clinic. What about us? You cannot force us to stay in that horrible hotel. I've had enough of this, believe me. I want to return to America! Please, calm down. That is not possible at the moment. But you're not forced to stay in that hotel. You can go wherever you like. Excuse me, inspector, but we were supposed to go to Sitges today. Go ahead. Sitges is a small town and it'll be easier for us to protect you there. That's what Mr. Burton requested at the consulate. Allow us to investigate. Try to remain calm and do not panic. We're closer to solving the case than you think. There's a fellow who'd never get my vote in any election. I'm sorry about Naiba. Do you think she'll be able to rejoin the group? Of course. Maybe tomorrow. We're here! A roll of film. I guess it belonged to poor Lisa Sanders. I wonder if it can still be developed. Give it to me, you might lose it. It belongs to Ms. Naiba now. I'll give it to her. - What day is today? - Friday. Friday the 19th. - Three days to go. - Let's get a move on, then. We've got to find out why Lisa Sanders was murdered. It's not complicated. He killed her for the same reason he killed the others. No, not at all. This was different. The other victims had their left eye removed, while the photographer... ...was attacked from behind and had her throat slashed with cold determination. But you're forgetting that Ms. Naiba interrupted the murderer. It could be, but I'm not totally sure. I think the killer had a different reason this time. - What? - I'm just taking a guess but... ...let's suppose that, by pure chance, Ms. Sanders... ...found something that could have framed the murderer. Something she wasn't even aware of. The murderer sensed it and had to kill her. - But found what? - That's the question. Come in! Inspector, this is from the American consulate. It's in English! It's the details we requested on the group. Hamilton, Alvarado, Bronson... Well, what does it say? Wait a minute! We have something here. Listen to what they say about Mark Burton! Why didn't you tell the inspector? Sure. That's easy to say. It started with a doubt. A terrible doubt I didn't even dare tell myself. What about later, when you knew that she was here? I couldn't prove anything. Alma was nowhere to be found, and she checked into that hotel under a false name. I don't have any proof. What about the dagger? And the picture? No, that's not solid proof. Why? Because I could have brought them here myself. There are my initials on that dagger, it's mine. We must get out of this maze, no matter the cost. Sometimes I think that there's someone helping her. Someone who's following a precise plan. An accomplice? Well... I don't know. Mark, can I ask you something personal? Could it be that your wife found another man? I asked myself that same question. I'm just guessing, but it would explain a lot. It wouldn't explain the murders, of course. What if someone is committing the murders to frame you? Maybe it's someone back home, some rival who wants to damage your business! Arthur Slater, for example! Or maybe some corporation! What are you trying to say? That you haven't seen Alma in Barcelona, and no one else has! Someone did and got killed because of that! Like Lisa Sanders. Only Alma could have ripped that picture in half. There's something I still don't get. One detail regarding Alma in Burlington. I can't put it together! It doesn't make sense! Please, stop. We're not playing a game. You're right. We must get out of this maze. I'm going back to Barcelona to see Inspector Tudela. Just a slight fever. Do you feel better? I'm so tired but I can't sleep. Take one of these. It will help you sleep. - Do you need anything else? - No, thank you. Goodnight. - Is she alright? - Yes. - Okay, very well. - Good evening. Yes? Excuse me, nurse, I would like to say hello to Ms. Naiba. She's a friend of mine. Room 24, father. But you'll need to get permission to see her. It's so late. Wait here. Yes? There's someone who wants to see Ms. Naiba. I told him to wait. I'll talk to him. - Let's go. - Yes. He was here a moment ago! Father? Father? I don't understand. He left the flowers and... What did he look like? Quite old. I think he was English, maybe American. He wore a collar. Connect me to the police station, please. That booth over there. I forgot the sweets I bought for her... ...so I went back to get them. That's one big coincidence. You came back here right after the killer fled. Well... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. Can you show me what's inside that briefcase? How often do you bring an empty briefcase around? Oh, never. I bought this two hours ago at a store down the Diagonal. The price tag is still attached, see? - I see. - May I return to Sitges now? There's a cab waiting for me. Yes, you're free to go. - Are you sure you don't need me anymore? - I'm sure. No funeral Mass today. How is she? Much better. She just needs rest. Good. May I question her? Of course. Good girl. Did you see his face? Could you identify him? Red. He was red. You mean the red raincoat? I understand. Try to rest now. Get some sleep. The window was ajar. Who would have thought that... Any footprints? Nothing, I'm afraid. No footprints anywhere. What time is it? It's 11:20. Call Inspector Lara. Tell him that the priest will get there in about 15 minutes. He must not tell anyone about what happened here. Got it? Yes, inspector. Flamenco isn't just a spectacle, it's an art form! You can't visit Spain without seeing it at least once! Well... I don't think it would be appropriate under the circumstances. Come on, it's 15 minutes to midnight. What do you say? What do you think? Well, I'd like to, but... ...I'm waiting for my wife. She had to return to Barcelona... ...because she forgot something at the hotel. She'll be back any minute. You three are up to something, don't deny it! Are you joining us? With three old guys like you? Only if you invite Paulette too. - Deal? - Of course, I forgot to ask her! Could you please call room 78? Ms. Stone is resting. She doesn't want to be disturbed. Okay, I see. Well? No luck. She's sleeping. Good evening. - Goodnight. - See you tomorrow. Are you joining us, father? No, thank you. - Hello? - Yes? Can you tell me whether Mr. Burton is in his room? No, he's not. - Did anyone leave a message for me? - Mr. Martinez. Thanks. Goodnight. - Keep the change. - Thanks. Have you seen Father Bronson? There's a call for him. He was in the lobby, I think he went to his room. - He's not in his room. - He's probably around here somewhere. Thanks. I'm going to see if my wife has arrived. See you later. Mind if I go to bed? Of course not. Get some sleep. Goodnight. Help! Help! Hurry! Help me! Help! Quick, don't let him get away! Are you hurt? Here, let me help you. Give me your hand. Here. Try to calm down. It's over. - Stop! - Let go of me! Let go of me! Does it hurt? - A little. - Jenny! - Try to remain calm. - Jenny! Jenny, I'm sorry, it's all my fault! Are you hurt? It's just a scratch, don't worry. Take her to the hospital. I'll have an officer drive you there. - I'm going too, inspector. - Let me help you. Let go of me! He was near the wall. We found this on the ground. This is ridiculous. I was about to catch the killer when they jumped me! But your initials are on the dagger, Mr. Burton. That's incredible. Two attempted murders in the same evening. Only Jack the Ripper could have managed that. I'm telling you I was nowhere near that clinic. I was in Barcelona to see you. And tell me a crazy story about Burlington, your wife... ...the Hotel Presidente and the dagger. But unfortunately, you couldn't find me. Should I believe you? I've already told you, inspector. Alma couldn't control herself anymore. She kept fainting, she had a nervous breakdown... No. I'd say that she was desperate after finding out who you really are. She found out about your sadistic tendencies! What have we got on that girl who was murdered in Burlington? That she had a relationship with Mr. Burton. A very intimate one. It's a lie! Terry was the daughter of my family doctor! Maybe she had a little crush on me, but nothing more. Let her in. Come in. I'm sorry to have bothered you. - Please sit down. - Thank you. Forgive me, but I must ask you a personal question. Do you remember when that girl in Burlington was murdered? I do. Did you already have an intimate relationship with Mr. Burton? Yes. But it wasn't the kind of intimacy that you're suggesting. I understand. Were you aware of the relationship between Terry Moore and Mr. Burton? No. I never met that girl. Thank you. You can go now. Paulette, I'm sorry. There was never anything between Terry and me. You have to believe me. You'd better confess, young man. Listen to me. Stop telling us that crazy story. Leave your wife out of this, wherever she is. Where do you think she is if not in Barcelona? Maybe she's on vacation in Florida. - Bronson. - Thank you. - Your passports, Mr. Hamilton. - Thanks. - Do you feel better? - Yes. - Alvarado. - Finally! Book the first flight to New York. I'm going to see my analyst tomorrow morning. Hello, Ms. Stone. Why are you still here? Shouldn't you be comforting your boss? That's all? One more thing: he's a monster. They should sentence him to the gas chamber. Are you absolutely sure that he's the killer? Did you identify him? Why don't you ask the inspector? You shouldn't have said those things. It's not up to us to judge, you see. - And... - And what, father? Well... To be honest with you, I am not entirely convinced that Mr. Burton is guilty. I think that poor Lisa took to her grave... ...the truth behind these horrible murders. I don't understand. What do you mean? Didn't your friend tell you anything? Maybe she found something. Not that I know of. Did you develop that roll of film I gave you? They'll deliver the developed photos any minute. Search through her things, listen to me. You never know what you could find. We could find a clue, or a detail you might have missed. But why? Do you have another suspect? Hello? Hello, Burlington? Yes, I'll hold. Is this the Burton residence? Nobody's answering? I see. Cancel the call. Wait! I need to contact the best lawyer in Barcelona. Just ask somebody! Here he is, inspector. - Good morning. - Hello. Sit down. Do you know this man? Yes. Where did you see him? The Hotel Presidente, inspector. He was looking for his wife there a few days ago. He got the last name wrong but I still allowed him to go to room 108. Can you describe the lady in room 108? A very distinguished lady. Is that her? - Do you recognize her? - Well... There's a resemblance, but I'm not completely sure. - You know how many people we see... - All right. You're free to go, but remember to be at our disposal. Yes, inspector. Do you believe me now? Are you satisfied? I told you the truth! Do you remember what colour Terry Moore's eyes were? Of course. They were grey and blue. See? I was right. Well. The three girls killed in Barcelona all had light eyes. It's an important clue. Inspector. Here's the report on the injuries sustained by Jenny Hamilton. As you can see, apart from some minor details, it's the same modus operandi. The killer's right-handed. The blows were struck in rapid succession... ...from a high angle. Let me show you. Look. The blows to the abdomen were inflicted with great violence. My wife is left-handed! She could have never held the dagger in her right hand! You're right. And the victims were killed by a right-handed killer. This confirms that your wife isn't the killer. Someone put that dagger in her hand, then... The real killer. It makes sense now. Paulette was right! Someone is trying to frame me with this crazy story... ...about Alma being in Barcelona! Someone from Burlington. Now listen, Mr. Burton. This box contains the eyes removed from the victims. Shape, colour... Look at them. You could come up with something. They're just replicas made of glass, of course. Glass... Now I remember. Why didn't I think of it then? The eye I found when I opened that drawer was identical to these! I think I know who the killer is. Inspector, let's call Burlington. Come in. Good morning. There's something for you. Thank you. Father Bronson! Father Bronson? Excuse me, have you seen Father Bronson? He left about an hour ago. He said he was going to visit the old castle. Where is it? It's easy. It's right out of town, on the hill. You can't miss it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Let's go! - Yes! Excuse me, father, is this yours? Yes, it is. I must have dropped it. Thank you. Forgive me, miss, but now that I see your face I feel a little unsettled. Why? You look like someone who's very dear to me. Really? Yes. Here. The girl on my left. It struck me when I looked at your face. You have the same eyes as my daughter Martha's. Where is she now? She's dead. She was only 19. Come on! Let's go! Hurry! - I want to sit in the back! - Wait for me! - Let's go! - All aboard! Father Bronson! Father, I'm here! Hello, this is Inspector Tudela calling. Any news? Nothing, inspector. We couldn't contact that person in Sitges. Why? The person left the hotel about half an hour ago. The person is probably going to the old castle like the two other tourists. Any more orders? No. That's all for now. No! No! No! Yes. I killed them. All of them! Even the one back in Burlington! Their eyes... I couldn't stand their eyes! I was like them once! I was like you! Before my best friend at school destroyed my eye while playing with scissors! She kept her beautiful blue eyes... Nobody punished her! Nobody! But I punished them! Don't look at me! Don't look at me, I said! Paulette, stop! Let her go! You've already caused enough harm. It's over. No! No! Go away or I'll slit her throat! It would be pointless. Just like it was pointless to steal the dagger and the picture from my office... ...or pretend to be Alma in that hotel. Drop it! It's all over now. - Are you okay? - Yes. Paulette! - Just in time! - You took a big risk. Father Bronson told me to look for a clue, he suspected Paulette. He saw her outside the clinic the night I was attacked. Paulette sensed the danger, followed the father here and silenced him forever. Mark... Thank you. I was so stupid. Can you forgive me? Burlington's on the line. Speak up, please. Hello? Mark, is that you? Alma! Where have you been? I've been trying to call you for days! I'm sorry, Mark. I didn't have the courage to go to that clinic in New York. I decided to visit my mother in Florida. It was good for me. I feel much better now. I need to see you and explain everything! Yes. Listen... There's something I need to tell you, too. I was so upset when you left the hotel in Paris. That's when I decided to take the flight to Barcelona. So you were in Barcelona? I didn't even have the courage to leave the airport. I took a flight back immediately. I had time to think these past few days. I agree to the divorce. I love you, Mark. But I don't want to ruin your life. No, Alma. We've both made mistakes but it's not too late to start all over again. Mr. Burton! I'm here to wish you a safe journey. Thank you, inspector. Good luck. By the way, inspector, out of curiosity... When you arrested me you said that my wife was probably in Florida. How did you guess? I didn't guess. I simply got a call from a colleague in Burlington. I asked him to locate your wife. Pretty simple, right? - What day is today? - Sunday. You solved the case just in time. Yeah. Now I can finally start fishing trouts. Well... It's up to you now. Good luck... Inspector Lara. Thank you.
