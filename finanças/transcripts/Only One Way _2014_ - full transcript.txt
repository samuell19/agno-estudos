- Ooh. Hey, little Johnny. Why's he setting up the Christmas tree? It's only September. - It's his thing, man. - Oh, okay. Hey, that sounds good. Hello. I'm sorry, I can't hear you, speak up. Yeah, I'll be there. Okay, bye. That's good, Johnny. - Do you really like Professor Johnson? - I mean, yeah, he's cool, why not? - He's so boring. - You're just too picky. - I'm the picky one. - Whatever, I gotta go. - Hey, don't be late for Bible study tonight. - Okay, I won't. - Sorry, I'm late. - Aw, don't worry about it. - So I been thinking what I should get Mom for Christmas. - Christmas? You're thinking about Christmas already? Son, you have plenty of time for that. Besides, your mom just wants you to serve God anyways. - I been serving God my whole life, Dad. - I know you have and we're proud of you for that. - Paul? It's time of Bible study. - I'm coming. You guys don't need to wait for me, you know. - Well, it's your turn to give the message. - Right. Let's go to Jeremiah 29:13. The word says, seek God and you'll find him. There's just a lot of meaning in that for me. - That's our God. He'll never forsake us. - So many people stop serving God. - Son, they just need prayer. - Paul? Maybe you should start a Bible at your college. - If you'll excuse me. - I just really like classical music. - Great, we've been looking for a violinist. - Really, does that mean y'all have an opening? - Yeah, you can probably sign up, we can probably get you in. - All right, sounds great. - Hey, do you need some help. - Yeah, I don't know how to change a tire. Can you help? - Yeah, let me look at it okay? Yeah, do you have a spare? - Um, yeah, it's in the trunk. - Okay, yeah. Looks like you got everything here. - I've been so swamped with homework. - Yeah, tell me about it. - So how was Friday night? - It was so awesome. - Really, what happened? - So many people got saved by Christ. I mean they were just running up to the altar, it was crazy. - Oh, that sounds amazing. I'll have to be there next time. - Yes, definitely. - Oof. Okay, yeah, that should be good. - All right, thank you. I'm Melanie by the way. - Hey, I'm Paul. - Hey, so if I ever have another problem, I could call you? - Okay, yeah, sure. All right. Okay. - All right, thank you. - Um, drive safe all right. - All right. Bye. - Bye. - Hey, Tim. - Hey, man. Hey, man, come on. - You're late. - I know. I had to help this girl, she got a flat tire. - So you helped her? - Yeah.

She just looked so helpless. - You helped her right? - Oh, yeah, of course. - You learned to change a tire when you were about. - I was eight. - Really, that young, huh. - I learned from the best. - Well, that's true. - Mark the blameless man and observe the upright and the future of that man is peace. Hello? Hi, Paul, it's Melanie. - Oh, hey. - I just wanted to thank you again for helping me with my flat tire today. - Yeah, I'm glad I could help. - And I would like to have coffee with you sometime, could we? - Sure.

You guys have a lovely house. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you. - My daddy's a very successful business man. - Stop being gross. - Your mom is the most beautiful woman in the world. - I thought I was. - No, I am. - Will you two stop. - So, Paul, are you living on campus right now? - I'm actually living at home with my parents. - Really. Wow, you know you're not a real man until you move out of your parents' house. - I agree. - Yeah. - What do you think of being a real man? So I've been thinking about getting my own place. About time I grew up and became a real man, I suppose. - All right, tell me something Paul. What does having your own place have to do with being a real man? - Everything. - You don't think it's gonna be hard? I mean you're gonna have to go to school, and when you get off you're gonna have to go to work and then you gotta pay your bills. - I gotta try. - Okay, Paul. - Let's get back to our run, yeah. - Sure.

And what's the truth? - What am I doing? I'm gonna be late to meet Kathleen. What are you doing here? - I was so drunk last night that I couldn't even drive, so I just slept on your couch. - You should go. - Let me tell you something. - I don't wanna hear it. - I just want you to know that you're a man. Like you're the only guy who never tried sleeping with me and didn't really use me just for sex. When I get older, I want to homeschool my kids. - Why do you say that now? - Well, honestly, I struggled in high school, especially my senior year. - I thought you said you had so much fun in high school. - I pretended to be happy. - Are you pretending right now? You're not gonna finish your food, man. - I'm not hungry. - What's up man? - I got a lot on my mind. I'm moving back to Colorado. - Okay, why? - There's this doctor there. I guess my mom goes and sees him. You know, he says she has cancer. - I'm really sorry. - I need to go help out with my little brother, you know, be the man. - Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry, man. - Paul, you need to go back home. You know the Bible says we should honor our parents. - I'm just not ready. God. What am I gonna do? Hello? Hey, Paul, so let's party at your place tonight. - I don't have a place right now. What, what happened? - Hey, Lady, where you been? Hey. Where've you been. - Hey. What are you doing out here? - Just pretending to have a picnic. - Oh, really. - Yeah, when my mom was alive, we would always come here for a picnic. - You really miss your mom, huh? - I miss her so much. - Sometimes I just want to fall asleep so I can see her in my dreams. - Does that work? - Yeah. Whenever I dream, we're always here having a picnic. And then I wake up and she's not here and I get sad. Hey, Lady, you want some sandwich. - Hey, Ben. - Wow, you must be really hungry. Want some more? You want some? - Sure. - Okay. - Oh, cool. Your picnic and everything, yeah. - Yeah. - It's really good. - Thanks. - You look really happy today. - Yeah, I don't have to go to school. - Really? - Yeah, my stepmom's homeschooling me now. - That's pretty cool. And that makes you happy? - Yeah, it's what my real mom used to do. - All right, Ben, time to go. - I gotta go. - All right. - I'll see you. They must still be on vacation. - What's up man? - Hey, I saw you from other there. You look kind of hungry. - No, I'm good. - You sure? - Yeah. - You know what, I'll be right back. - I am pretty hungry. - Here you go, man. - Oh, thank you. - No problem man, God bless. - Oh, thank you. - Hey. What are you doing here? - I came here to practice drums. - Oh, it's nice, huh. Quiet, everyone went home for Christmas. - Yeah, it's nice. - So have you done your Christmas shopping? You know we could still use you on the drums. - I'm sorry, I've been really busy. - I mean, the least you could do is help me decorate the tree. - Yeah, sure. Of course. How long you been here? - Just an hour or so. - Here, let me get that for you. - Someone sounds hungry. - No, no, I'm good. - Come on, let's go eat. - Really? - Yeah, come on, let's go. But, we just. - It's okay, let's go eat. All right, let's go. - Something's different. - Like what? - Oh, I don't know, it's nothing. We're gonna have a good Christmas. - Thanks for this. - Yeah, no problem. - It was good. I hear these make you fat, though. - Yes, they do. But they're so good, they're addicting. Me and my brother, we'd go get them all the time. - Really? - Yeah. - You guys are close, huh? - Yeah, I mean basically best friends. - What, he didn't have his own friends? - Well, we were homeschooled, so, all we had was each other really. - You were homeschooled? - Yeah, we were. - I didn't know that. You liked it? - I love it. I mean, me and my brother got to spend a lot of time together and grow really close and I mean I'm glad my mom homeschooled me. I love it. - Huh. - So, why don't we go finish the Christmas tree, come on. - Yeah. Okay, let's go. Back to work. - Don't move, stay right there. Now you look like a Christmas tree. - And you look like an angel. I'm sorry, that was really cheesy. - So what are your plans this Christmas Eve? - I don't know, what are you doing? - Me and the band are gonna go down to the homeless shelter and play some music. - Really, that sounds really great. - Do you want to come? - I'm sorry, maybe. - You know, every Christmas my brother would just stare at the Christmas gifts under the tree and one year my father told me not to forget the real meaning of Christmas. So before we could open any of the presents, I would remind everybody the true meaning of Christmas of why our Lord Jesus was born. - That's really great. God. What do I do God? What do I do? I know. I know. God. Why? What do I do? - Hey. - Hey. - These past couple of days, they've been great. I don't think I've had so much fun in a long time. - Life with God is always fun. - I'm realizing more and more what's important. Seriously, thank you for being a good friend. - You're welcome. - Oh, hey, hey, Lady, guess what? I actually remembered you, look. I know it's a couple days old, but it's good, right. Okay, we're about to go to a homeless shelter, all right. I know we're technically homeless, too, but it'd be nice to help somebody. Hello? - Paul. Can you come see me? Paul, I wanna kill myself. - No, no, don't say that. - You know where I am. - Okay, I'm on my way right now, okay. Oh, my God. - Okay. All right, I think he's gonna come. - What a loser. I don't know why you like this guy, man. - Oh. - Look who it is. Melanie never shuts up about you. - We really miss you. Remember last Christmas when we were all together. - Yeah, man, what you been up to bro. - You seem fine to me. I rushed over here. - Come on, it's Christmas Eve, I miss you. - I don't know why he's acting like that. - I don't know how you guys do it. I have things to do and somehow you guys always pull me back in. - Come on man, Melanie wants you here anyway, ain't that right? Yeah. - I had plans. - Oh, really. What are those? - I'm gonna go feed the homeless. - You mean go feed yourself. By the way, man. What happened? - So the mama's boy goes back home. - Yeah, man, I heard you lost your place, - I don't have to sit here and take this seriously. - Wait a second, man, we're just having fun over here. Won't you just stay with her for a little bit, huh? Party just started. Ooh. Tough guy, huh? Be a real man about it, okay. You know what's your problem Paul? You think you're better than all of us. Wait, where you going? Let me talk to you. Where you going? - Back off. - Oh, yeah. - Hey, stop, come back inside, have a drink. - It'd be that easy, just to come inside and have a drink. Go back to everything and have fun, huh? - That's it. - This isn't how we're supposed to live. - You know what, since you wanna be all preacher like, why don't you tell us all how to live, Paul. Huh, why don't you let us know exactly what we need to do, St. Paul. - It's not supposed to be like this. It's not supposed to be like this. Jesus is the only way. - Paul wait! Come on. - Hello? - Hey, Mom. I wanna come home. - Where are you? I'm at a homeless shelter. - A homeless shelter, are you okay? - I'm feeding the homeless. - I love you. I've been praying for you every day. - I love you, too. Your prayers worked. Bye mom. - Bye.
