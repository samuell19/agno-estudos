Will you care for me like this? We have known each other for so long. Have you ever paid so much attention to me like now? It’s only because I’m thin now. I got pretty. I care about you. Focus on you. That has nothing to do with your weight, or your appearance. Xiaoxi. if you really wanna slim down. You must do exercise. Keep on a diet. You can’t control your appetite. You can’t keep doing exercise. Tell me, how will you lose that weight? Every time I take you to work out You always have some excuses not to. How will you ever lose weight. You need to be responsible for yourself okay? Nobody can help you except yourself. Do you get it? He is fooling you around, can’t you see? You’re always like this. Since we were in school, you are like this. You’ve always put other people before yourself, tortured yourself. Can you also put yourself into account as well? I can’t save you. You gotta help your own. I got fat for helping you! You... You helped me with what? You don’t remember? You don’t. Don’t come. I don't want you to see me turning back to Lin Xiaoxi. You’ve always been Lin Xiaoxi. Always are. I’m also a decent man. I shouldn’t fight with him. I want to apologize to you. But... I don’t want to see you and Han Bing being so close. I wanna ask you a question. If I get fat one day. Will you still treat me like now? How could you ever get fat? I was discussing with Lu to help you become a star. Forget about being fat. I think You’d better lose two or three kilos. I know you will come back again. You wanna stop it or continue？ Dream Fixer. I want the Permanent Dream Fixer. You’re getting even more unruly. Be reasonable! Okay, okay. You gave me that thing. You have to answer for it. Fine. Permanent Dream Fixer. Permanently. Using this can let you live your life As you are now. Don’t you forget I’ve told you this comes with certain cost. What kind of cost? Don't you realize it? People are always greedy for things they don’t have, Forget to cherish what you already have. They will only realize the cost when it’s too late. Hello. Have your started to write your song? I’m on it. I always have this strange feeling lately. What’s wrong? My memory is getting worse. Things are like a mess in my mind. My hand. How did I hurt my hand? Cut it out. Don't play dumb. Focus on your work. I will stop by some other day. I’ve told you this comes with certain cost. We fully respect director’s intention Miss Song, it’s not like that. It’s... It’s not my call. Fine. Okay. Okay. I know. Okay. Next We shall welcome our main actor Chris Huang. And the main actress Alice in this MV. Chris Huang Hi, Chris Huang. Chris Huang, could you please tell us When did you and Su Mengmeng become a couple? What do you like about Su Mengmeng. Rumors said Su Mengmeng was signed to your company because of her relationship with you. Is that true? She was overwhelmed when she joined our company initially. I’m more experienced so I tried to help her. Then naturally we got closer and closer. Please give us more space. Thank you. Miss Alice. About your identity, there are rumors circulating online. Would you like to explain it? Rumors...about what? Some acquaintance says your background and your identity are all fake. And they say you were once weight more than 100kg. Your appearance is a result of Liposuction and plastic surgeries. So may I ask Is that true? Did you do plastic surgeries just to get into this show business? There were news said ， you were deeply involved with Christ Huang. Now that his relationship with Su mengmeng has gone public, do you have any comments? Miss Alice. Are you having an affaire with him? Miss Alice. Can you tell me is it all hype between you and Mr. Chris Huang or it is true? Miss Alice. You bitch. Ugly monster. You think you can get Chris’ attention? Are you alright? I... Why are they so nasty? You can’t fight with people online. Besides, they wouldn’t listen. Keep the coat. Take care. Where’re you going? Han Bing, why do you treat me like this? You... do you need any help? What do you mean? Don’t you recognize me? I’m sorry. You must have taken me for someone else. Who else? What’re you talking about? I’m not mistaken. I... Look. Look. Is it you and me? Who is this? Where did you get those photos? This... This... This is me. This... This is us. This is us. Don’t you know me? I’m Lin Xiaoxi! Xiaoxi? Xiaoxi. You’re not Xiaoxi. I’m Xiaoxi. I’m Xiaoxi. I’m her. I’m her. Don’t you recognize me? I’m Xiaoxi. Now I... I’ve lose some weight. I got thinner. But I’m still Xiaoxi. I’m Xiaoxi. I’m her. Calm down, calm down. Miss please calm down. I’m Xiaoxi. I’m Xiaoxi. Don’t you recognize me? Please calm down. Keep calm. I... Listen to me, listen. Well, Xiaoxi and I.... Xiaoxi and I... We grew up together. But I haven’t seen her for a long time. I don’t know where she is. I miss her so much. But you’re definitely not her. I’m sorry. Share me Han Bing's Wechat ID. Share me the Wechat ID. Excuse me, Han Bing. I want a... I know. Not too spicy. Extra peanut butter. Spring onion set aside separately, with bean sprout and chitterlings. And no coriander. Where’s Xiaoxi? Why are you only by yourself today? I just want some noddles. Okay. Reporters found Chris Huang and Su Mengmeng shopping together. Very sweet. It's so touching Playboy can also turn to be a loyal man. He doesn’t remember me now. How is that possible? I heard, He wrote a song for the girl he likes. I thought he wrote it for you. If it’s possible. Can you ask him to sell that song to me? A song? What brought you here? I wanna listen to Han Bing’s song. You haven’t? What a team. Han Bing. Han Bing. Han Bing. Where's the key? No. You two are just deceiving yourselves. You have regular dates every month at the same place. Neither sleet nor rain could stop you. Still hold onto the friends term. Yeah, like I would believe it. No. Good evening. Another round! Don’t you know you’re allergic to this? Don’t eat it. Xiaoxi likes this. Come on. Let’s go. Who would choose a pig as girlfriend? Say it again? How dare you? Don’t you dare say that about Xiaoxi! I’ve grown tired of his face. If any of you like him, just tell me. I can help. Cut it out, Lin Xiaoxi. You are a hypocrite. Everyone knows you love him. Xiaoxi and I We grew up together. I was fat at the time, My classmates bullied me, but Xiaoxi wouldn’t. She is She is so kind. So brave. She likes to take photos, likes to buy beautiful clothes. And she is a big foodie. Every time, when I watch her eating, that pleasant look makes me so happy. Although she is a little fat. But in my heart, She is the most beautiful and most kind girl. I hope this year I can start a relationship with a supper hot guy! Now help me to make it happen! Help me realize it. Make it happen! Make it real! You hear me? She is my first audience Finally, I wrote a song for her. Open the door. Open the door. Let me in! Hey! Open the door. Open it! You little girl. Keep making requests. Do I look like an easy-going man? You chose this. Once it starts, there’s no way to stop it. Game has rules. One last time. I wanna reverse it. Turn everything back. I’m not here to ask for more. I just want to go back to the past. I’ve been ignoring him. It’s because, I don't have the courage to face the one I really care. I’ve realized it. The one who really minds me being fat was never him. Not my friends either. It’s me. I’m such a coward. I was so afraid. I was afraid of those criticisms. I was afraid if we cross that line, we would end up like strangers. That made me a joke, a huge joke. Have you really think it through? This is the last chance. I change you back There’s no more change of mind. I’ve made up my mind. I want that. Han Bing. I’m back. Today is the 17th. Are you here? Han Bing. Do you remember me now? Xiaoxi. Lin Xiaoxi. What’re you doing? I thought you were not coming today. I... I thought you didn’t remember me anymore. I thought you would never speak to me anymore. What did you say? I said, I thought you didn’t remember me anymore. I thought you would never speak to me anymore. Speak louder, I can’t hear you. I thought you don’t remember me anymore. Wait there, I’m coming. Han Bing. Han Bing. I know it’s two-for-one, but slow down. Your face is getting puffier. I... Got fatter? Yeah. But it doesn’t matter. Haven’t even noticed it's autumn already. Lots of things happened unnoticed. You have changed back now. Do you regret it？ No. I’ll become even better. I know. We will all become better. I know. Is there anything that you don’t know? Now I realized, I have fallen for you a long time ago. I love you. Now And Ever. I will love you forever.
