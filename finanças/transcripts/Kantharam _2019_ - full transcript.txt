Welcoming you to Breaking news. Great online fraudulent play aiming the tourists of Kerala. Coming to the details of news. This massive loot is centered around the families and tourists coming from foreign countries and other states, to see the forest areas of Kerala. This gang attacks the tourist vehicles by blocking them in various ways like puncturing the tyres,etc and creating accidents with heavy vehicles. There are huge gangster teams situated in the borders of the state only for this purpose. The team attacks after a clear estimation of the vehicle colour, number, persons inside it, number of males and females, etc. The preplanned attacks are later converted into natural accident cases by this gang. These cases are not being noticed clearly, which is the reason for such repeated occurences. The complaint that government is not taking any action against these gangs is being raised strongly now. Former IG for crimes Mr.Kamalesh is here with us to discuss on this matter. Sir, what is the stand of government in this matter? See, according to the changes happening in various periods, the nature of crimes also change. But the government has taken notice of such crimes and started necessary actions. Like signboard, night patrolling, etc. But what i really meant is that, by the time we find a solution, they arise with new fraudulent plays. For example, recently there happened a case of missing of 4 couples who had come to Kerala for honeymoon. News on none of them is found here. But I'm sure they are not dead. I cannot reveal further details on this case. I'm sorry. Ok sir, thank you. I can't do this No problem Baby, i have surprice for you What surprice? Excuse me. Surprice What are you doing. Don't worry. Please wait. Welcoming you all to this episode of 'Kaanaakkazhchakal. Today I am going to introduce you a very different personality in this episode. Sri.

See Mr.Sidharth.. since some months, there is someone playing behind tourists in Kerala Karnataka border, especially newly married couple.Whoever is playing, let them, but their real intention is not clear till now. Missing couple are newly married and all have There is no clarity whether these people are alive or dead. As it happens beyond our state, we have limitations for the enquiry too. What reply can I give to the CM ? Usually these team aim at money, gold, vehicles, etc while creating accidents. But this is not clear. So the responsibility of this case goes to Sidharth. Ok sir. You have interest in such cases also right? Your investigation methods are different too. So all the best. Thank you sir. Poor fellow, such a case during his marriage time itself. If i am not interfering in your personal matters, is this a right idea? What is this dad, I will return soon right? Sidhu, did you marry me for your investigation purpose? Tell me Sidhu. My life and my future, everything you spoiled. Finally you are safe, but me? Tell me now, what should I do? tell me, Swathy, please listen to me. I am a police officer. In police records, this Martin and gang was just robbers. But this hidden cameras and video streamings, i was totally unaware all this. But now I am proud of you. Because we have saved a lot of couples from falling in this trap. I am a girl. I want to live in this society. You are living with me, I am your husband. But this video, those who see it should think one thing. It could be their mother, wife or sister. If so will they enjoy it or share it? Swathy, I am the son of a father who taught me who is a woman and who is a mother. I am an unlucky son who did not get the care and love of a mother. Again i can get all this only through you. I love you Swathy, I love you
