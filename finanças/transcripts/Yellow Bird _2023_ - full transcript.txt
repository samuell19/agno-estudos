Ah. Crap. Come on. Jakey? What is all this? Are you homeless? No, no. I. I'm just going through some personal things at home, and I had to sleep in the car. Okay. Can you let me in so I can get some coffee? Fine. But just this one time. Do I make myself clear? Yeah, yeah. Crystal. Okay. I'll be back. Okay. You're a bloody wuss, Jake. Yes, you. It's too early for this. When are you going to learn to stand up for yourself? Just shut up. Jakey. Hmm? Are you insane? What are you doing? Oh no, that was for someone else? For someone else. Who else is here? Hello? I. I’m just, you know, caffeine deprived okay, well, you're also Joe now. Who's Joe? The last idiot I fired. Jake is my third husband. Fourth. What’s that sweetie. Jake ass is your fourth husband. I forgot, Brad. Fat nerd ball. Anyway. So My daughter Casey here was competing in the little miss sunshine beauty pageant. And I won. Let mama finish her story, baby. What I did. I know that, baby. But it's very important for you. Let me get my story out fine. I'm out of here. She's at that awkward age. So I was laying by the pool. At mar-a-lago and Jake walked by, and he was wearing a speedo. And he had moves like Jagger, and he had looks of Patrick Swayze. And I thought to myself, now he is dirty dancing husband material But sadly, he's like every other man. That I have married. It was a successful PR agent when I first met him. He was working for major corporations and celebrities, and now he is building pyramids. He's stacking them with cat food cans and toilet paper rolls. At this two bit grocery store. It's just it's just humiliating. It it’s awful. How was that? You're a natural. Now, if we can only do something about your roots. How long have you been married, Jake? 13 years. Hmm. That's not a very lucky number. Ee You ever tried counseling or therapy? You ever tried counseling or therapy? No. My wife Ellie doesn't believe in counseling. Oh, you know, that sounds like my father before him and my mother got divorced. Yeah. Counseling is a sign of weakness. Oh, no, no, no. I never said anything about divorce. I believe in marriage is for better or worse. Jakey, here you are, showing up to work with scratches and blood all over you. You use a Cpap machine, and now you are living out of your car. It doesn't get worse for you. And you know what you need? You need to grow a pair of these, jakey. Right here. All right. Oh, my goodness. Hey, tigger. I run a grocery store here, not a bunny ranch. I want to see you and Howard back to work, please, and thank you. Chop. Chop. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Jake, what are you doing? Getting more coffee. What does it say? Scotty. Underneath, Scotty. Store manager. Mm hmm. And don't you forget it. I want you to finish that TP display that you were working on yesterday. You remember that? And then you can get more coffee. Thank you. Good morning Mr. Rush. Scotty. Oh, my goodness. This hair, everything about it. Gorgeous. Beautiful. It's going to look even better in the grocery store. Go show it off, girl. Yep. Yeah. You see that? I can do that sort of thing, because unlike you, I know who wears the pants in my marriage. Back to work, please. No, no. Little boy. No. I'm just reading what's on my clipboard. Paula. That’s the coward way out, Jake. You think you're the only one whose life is crumbling around you? I guarantee everyone in this store is facing some sort of dilemma. That includes the pretty blond cherub with the big blue eyes. She does resemble an angel. Why, thank you bright eyes. Crystal. Well, what are you doing here? Checking on you. You haven't been in any meetings lately? Yeah, I've been, you know, working a lot. Your wife gave you those sketches. Huh? Oh, no, no, I. I fell out of my attic. Details. Well, yeah, I was up in my attic. I was looking for my old art supplies because I thought if I get back into painting, you'll be good for my soul. And I. Ellie, she kind of locked the door, and there was just no other way out for me. So. There's always a way out. Bright eyes. It's just gotta know when to exit. So how did that gnome wind up in the hood of your car? I'll tell you, I threw that name at Jake because he's a perv. That's why. So this one that I was home alone watching. Here comes honey boo boo. There was no food in the house except for a leftover rotisserie chicken. That I already ate. And so I was stuck in whatever meat was left on one of the wings, and a bone got stuck in my throat and I couldn't breathe. So I passed out. And when I came to, Jake was standing over me, pressing on my chest and blowing air into my mouth. It was like, totally gross. Like. Like weird uncle gross. I mean, he's supposed to be my father. Where the hell that is? Hey mama. Mama we are outta cheese puffs. You almost finished, jakey. Yeah. Almost. Hey Howard one second, please. Jake, while you're up there, would you clean that light for me? Be a doll. Ee Whoa! Clean up, aisle six. Get. Out. Paula. Jakey. What am I going to do with you? It was an accident. No, no, no. Oh, well, I thought it was on purpose. No, you're a klutz, jakey. You are a middle aged klutz. Why don't you just fire me, then? Oh, yeah. And allow you to get unemployment from the government. No, no, no. I don't think so. Get back to work. I want to see all this teepee in a pyramid when I come back here in 5 minutes. Jake. Hey tigger. What's your favorite poison here? Well, my favorite poison is not here. He's over there. You seem happy. I'm not just happy, Jake. I'm over the moon. Happy. Divorcing Sam is one of the best things I could have done. I didn't know you and Sam having problems. That's because I knew how to put on a good front. So one day I woke up and realized. Time waits for no one learned to put myself first. Here. Have a bear claw. They’re Howie’s favorite. Thanks A bear claw Jake? Careful. I don't think Ellie likes muffin tops. I left my wallet in the car. $0.50. Here's $0.48. $0.50. Paula, why don't you just put the $0.02 in like you always do, and we'll call it a day, okay? Ee That was pretty funny what you told Paula earlier. Yeah, it's funny now, but I'm sure Paula is casting a spell on me as a speak you okay, Mr. Rush. Yeah, I just have this. Just this back spasm. Thing. Oh. Count your blessings. All that toilet paper blocked your fall. It could’ve been a lot worse. Saw that? Here, give me that. Just lean back and relax, okay? Does that feel good. Oh, yeah, it feels great. Your muscles are wound tighter. Than a slinky toy. When's the last time you had a massage? Oh, gosh, I can't remember. Well, it's really important. It stimulates blood flow and moves toxins out of your body. Not to mention the human touch is known to help with depression. Oh, should. Should be a nurse. I am, kinda. How so? Umm. Well my mom was in a really horrible car accident years ago. And after my daddy and my brother split, there's no one to take care of her except me. Have a nice day. Check it out. Paula. You're wicked. Not as wicked is Ellie. I can never leave her. You know, she's all I got. Her and my boyfriend, rusty. It's really nice. I should get back to my register. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, me too. Thanks. Yep. You're walking a fine line, jakey. I'm on a break. Breaks over, so get back to work. Really wish you wouldn’t do that. Oh, it's one of the perks of being a manager. Jakey. Comes with the job as store manager of the yellow bird. What's your natural color? My what? Your hair. What color is it? It’s blond of course. Oh, my god. You know, with your complexion and those gorgeous Hazel eyes. You know what would really make them pop a nice, warm ginger shade? Ee Yeah. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. You see this right here? Yeah. Grab it. Oh, yeah. Oh. I'm impressed, Scotty. You keep a secret. I've always wanted to be a hairdresser. What stopped you. Oh, my father. You know, he calls that a sissy job. And get this, he owns ten of these stores. Ten of them. Expects me to take care of every single one of them when he's gone. You married? Yes, I'm married. Happily? I can't complain, doll. Pity. You know, Scotty, the hottie. I'm a hot commodity. That's what they say. Ellie! Shhh. Just put this on Jakes tab. Wait. Is everything okay at home? Yeah. Well, what have you heard? I have not heard anything. But I saw something. Uh-huh. I know. I know. I'm sorry. Hellooo gorgeous. Hey, Doug, how have you been? Better now that I'm talking to you? What's up? Listen, I need a little bit of legal advice. Only I have all my money tied up in this reality show that I'm shooting. Keeping up with the Kardashians. Are you? You always did say that I was good at keeping things up. That you are. Don't worry that pretty little head of yours doll. In lieu of money, I'll take it out in trade. Thank you. Pardon me, but where can I find the gray poupon? Go away. Gnome. Oh, now I'm a gnome?!? Sorry, Steve. I thought you're someone else. Well, what the hell? You change your name or what? No, I. Bird crapped on me. It's a long story. What are you doing here? I thought you left Bailey heights. Yeah, uh. I gotta put my mom in a home. Yeah, I'm in the same situation, but she does want to leave her Winnebago. What about you leaving your home? I don't know. Winnebago. Your home. Jake, I just ran into Ellie in the parking lot. What the hell is wrong with that woman? So what? Jesus Christ, she's not the same woman you married. I'll tell you that right now. People change. Did her daughter change? Or is she still built like Jabba the hutt, right? No, it's not funny. It's not funny, Jake. Seriously, you got to do something, man. Look at you. I swear to god, you need to do something. You're not the same guy I knew. You used to be adventurous. Used to be fun. You used to be good looking. Alright, Steve. You can stop any time. I realize I need to change. Yeah. When? Soon. I'm going to hold you to it, alright. Let's grab a beer one night. Alright. Hang out. Bird dog some chicks later. Sure. Your friend’s, right Jake. You need to do something before your wife send you to an early grave. That or drives you crazy. I’m not gonna let that happen. That's what they all say. Until you find yourself locked up in a padded room wearing a straight jacket. Straight jacket? Don't you think that's a bit extreme? You're talking to a ceramic gnome. You tell me. Still here. I'm going to just throw you in the trash. Who are you talking to jakey? No one. I was just counting how many more ketchup bottles I had to stack. Okay, well, when you're done with that, I want to see you in my office. Okay? Okay. Say it with your chest, please. Okay. The long angled Bob, also known as a graduated Bob, is flattering and versatile. It frames your face beautifully and looks great. More an either straight or wavy. And who can forget the famous Farrah doo from the seventies? That is so cute. It's open. Scotty, you wanted to see me? Yeah. Do you own a suit, Jake? Yeah. Of course I own a suit. Well, I want you to wear it to work tomorrow. My father's coming by, so we're going to see if he can boot your middle ass up the corporate ladder at a different location. Serious. Huh? Yeah. No, I'm just messing with you. Oh. Gee, thanks, Scotty. That's really okay. Yeah, okay, well, you can. We can go now. What the?!? Ellie! Have you gone mad? Damn straight? I'm mad at you, and I am filing for divorce. What's. What's triggered this on? Oh, don’t act like you've been living under a rock, Jake. This has been a long time coming. Perv. Shut Casey. Mama, he hollered at me. Do not talk to my baby girl that way. She's not a baby girl. She's a grown woman who's got nothing. Nothing. If you keep feeding your ego like she's a beauty queen. I am a queen. No, you're not, Casey. You're an overnight recluse with no plans or purpose in your life. Oh, this isn't the pot calling the kettle black. When I first met you, you said you were comfortable. I was comfortable. I had a nice little nest egg that was going to last me all the way to retirement. And so you keep putting your hand in the cookie jar. This is golden. Who are you? I'm Harper. Ellie hired me to film the reality show. Why are you making a reality show? So I can let everybody know how you use and abused me. How on earth did I use or abuse you? I give you everything you ever wanted. Oh. Not everything. Oh, really? Uh-huh. What was it that was missing from your life, Ellie. Respect! When we moved to Bailey heights, you said we were taking off and we were going to palm beach. I can't help it if my mother got sick. Sick in her head. Ellie, that's so unfair. She has Alzheimer's. It's. It's not her fault if she can't remember things. So what's your excuse? Oh, wait a minute. Oh, wait a minute. You're a blacked out drunk. Now I am filing for divorce, and I do not want you to come one step closer to that house. You're forgetting one thing, Ellie. It's my house. Oh, no. Not for long. My lawyer says you do not have one leg to stand on. Lawyers cost money. He is pro bono. Is he? So you're offering him something in exchange for his services? Slap him again. Get out. I just want to know. What the hell triggered all this! You’re affair! What are you talking about? Oh, did not play dumb, Jake. Everybody knows Paula and tigger and everybody knows about your Becky skank. And I have proof. Proof? Yes! Proof. I've got pictures, Jake. Pictures. Right? Here she is and she’s rubbing your back right here in front of the store. And that just disgusts me. Now let loose of my arm, before I slap you with a restraining order. Perv! Perv! Perv! Perv! That was some show your wife put on earlier dude. Yeah. Well, he's always been a bit of a drama queen, but never this bad. Hey, you should talk to Freddie the butcher. His cousin's a lawyer. Works dirt cheap. Yeah, yeah, got me out of three DUli’s. And a grand theft auto attempt. Cars was in the shop at the time, ready stud? I’m always ready for you, babe. Mr. Rush? Yeah? Um. I hope I'm not the cause of the ruin of your marriage. Oh no Becky, our marriage is already in ruins. I just thought, maybe I. Maybe I could salvage. It, but I know. Oh, that's so sad. My mom said the same thing before her accident. I'm sure I'll work something out. It'll be fine. I hope so. See ya. Bye. Big perv! Babe! Oh my god. I get that a lot. I bet you could use a drink now, huh Jake? There is women on death row. Nicer than those two nasty trolls. You were living with. You have a game plan? Not yet. Better figure one out, you're not getting any younger. Just saying gotta go see my mom. Fred! Fred, wake up! Mom, nope, nope. There’s a burglar. Mom. No, no, no. Mom, dad dead. It's just me. It's just me, your son. Oh. Oh, that's too bad. Jakey, what are you doing here? Mark, I just. I have an interview in the morning, and I just need a good night's sleep. So, uh, Ellie, finally gave you the boot, did she? Yeah. Oh. Ow. What did you do that for? For marrying that bloodsucking leech in the first place? Oh. I’ll warm up some lasagne for you. Wow mom, I've never known you to make lasagna. This is. This is really great. Well, I didn't make it. Marie did. Who's Marie? Calendar. Right. Helen Schwartz has been doing most of my grocery shopping. Now. You remember Helen? Yes. She was married to. Oh, dear lord. Dale? What's his name? Dale. No, that's not it. No. Helen Schwartz's husband, Dale. I never heard it. Oh, well, what are you doing? I'm putting a cup of tea. No, no, no. That's a sugar bowl. That’s a sugar bowl. I’ll get you a cup. Potato. Potato. Here you go. So Ellie is getting a lawyer? Yeah, she says she's getting one. Are you going to get one? Yeah, I'm working on it. Lawyers cost money. Yeah, I know. Mom. Do you want me to sell the Winnebago? No, no, no, no. But. But, you know, it would be. It'd be nice if you could move somewhere a little less cramped. I don't want to go into a home. Yeah, no, I don't want that either. I just think. But I would if it would mean being less of a burden on you. You're not a burden on me. Mom. Okay. You never have been. Never will be. Look, uh, do you have any of pop's old suits or anything lying around? Yes. I do. Oh, that's pretty. This looks like something out of a jazzercise video. Oh. Oh, that's. That's pop's favorite hat. Oh, cool. How come you got so much of pop's his old clothes? Oh, because it reminds me he's still here. Oh, don't get this the wrong way, mom. But didn't you and pop's kind of, you know, get it. That we hated each other. There was a lot of good mixed in with the bad when it came to me and your father, jakey. But he was always my yellow bird. Did you say yellow bird? Mm hmm. What do you mean? Like where I work? I don't know where you work. Well, I just work just across the way there. We used to go shopping there. When? When I was younger. We did? Yeah. Every Thursday night, pops would get his paycheck and we'd go grocery shopping at the yellow bird. Helen Schwartz shops for me now. Uh. Right? Yes. So what's this about the yellow bird again? The yellow bird, jakey. It defines a person's true love. The one person they can't live without. If you find that joy, you are the luckiest person in the world. And if you don't, you're eternally screwed. Oh. Oh, I like that one. Yeah. Me too. What are you looking. For, mom? Oh, I'm getting you a blanket. That's the fridge. So it is ah ha. Oh. Thanks. What did your father do for a living? He was a salesman, but, uh, he was also a degenerate gambler. Basically burned through all his life savings. And by the time he died, he left my mom with. With this. I rather like this place. It's all so compact. Funny thing is, mom always said not to end up like your old man. Pissing my life away. But. But how'd that work out for you? You know, you're very opinionated, aren’t you? Who are you talking to? Jakey? Oh, no one. Oh. Sometimes I worry about you. Thanks. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite. But if they do, there's a can of raid under the sink. Today is going to be a great day, my friend. Who said we're friends. Of you looking like a member of the rat pack. Look at you. Looking like a member of the rat pack. Well, like you always said tigger. Sometimes you've got to put yourself first. And I finally realized that's what I'm going to do in life. Ellie is a fool to let you get away. Thank you. I always thought you deserve better. Thank you. Mr. Rush. I can't apologize enough for the way rusty treats you. Oh, look, Becky, honestly, it doesn't bother me at all. It bothers me. He bothers me. I can't take it no more. I'm sure you figure something out. I don't want to. I can't spend the rest of my life with someone who didn't even listen to me, you know? Oh, well, you'll figure it out. Right. Grrr. Don't even think about that. What? What are you talking about? Girls like that love to lure men like you in, huh? Only thing is, it never works out. Well, you know, it's sort of like going out after midnight, if you catch my drift. Scotty, I'm old enough to be your father. And that is the perfect age gap for girls with daddy issues. Jake. Is this your suit? Yeah. What's wrong with it? Oh, my goodness. This is his suit. You look like a half clown, half magician. Oh, my goodness. Tigger, we don't have time for this. Jake, we need to get in my office right now. My father is waiting for us. Would you get some coffee and pastries for us? Stat, please. In my office. Let's go, Jake. Go. Good lord. What the hell. Where is the crayons and the coloring book with this chair. Come in. Oh, good morning, pops. Morning, son. I'll take. Take a seat, Jake. All right, great. You guys are both sitting. How the hell do you work with this chair? I feel like I'm four years old, looking over a counter or something. Yeah, well, I work with what I have. Dad, it's not a great chair. I'm my own secretary. That's how it is. Why is this so heavy? My roster shows that you have one. Maggie Ryan, as your secretary. Maggie RY. Oh, Maggie's right. No, she quit. How come? She had no sense of humor? You must be Mr. Rush. Yes, but you can call me Jake. Ah. Lawrence Finley. It's a pleasure. And by the way, I like your suit. Thanks. Coffee, sir. Oh, please, please. Cream and sugar. Black. So uh. Scotty here tells me that you used to own your own PR firm. Yes, a very successful one. Oh, oh, oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you. So um. So just tell me, Jake. What uh? What happened? Oh, yeah, just life. Well, translated. He means wife. So, Jake, I'm curious if someone that has worked in public relations, what suggestions do you have to increase the business at this yellow bird location? Oh, yeah. I think, uh, if you really want to spike it and increase sales, I think introducing a home delivery service. That is not going to happen. Allow him to finish. Scotty. Okay. Yeah. Jake, finish. Up. Yeah, well, you know, take my mom, for instance. You know, she's elderly now, so she doesn't get out and do her own shopping. She relies on somebody else to do it for her. Or you have, you know, single mom or dad who are too busy to go to a grocery store on a daily basis. I mean, and just how would you order how would you do that? Well, I think we could add a special insert in the circulars that go out on a weekly basis or they could go to the website and order on the website. Jake? The website? We don't have a website. Jake. Uh, oh. We don't? No. Um. Mr. Finley do the other yellow bird stores have websites? Well, the ones in a major Metropolis do, but this yellow bird doesn’t. Well, with all due respect, sir, I mean, most people in these rural areas have access to the Internet or mobile phones or an iPad, which they call their best friend. Oh, jakey, is that what you call your devices, your friends? Oh, that is sad. That so sad. So, Jake, any other suggestions you might have? Oh, well, I think, you know, the staff could use a bit of a facelift. It still looks exactly the same as it did when I used to come here as a kid and, you know, maybe introducing rewards campaign you know coupons like the green stamps used to have. Like food stamps. That's food stamps. Jake, that's food stamps. That's food stamps. Jake, what is your current position here at the yellow bird? Uh. It’s um. Stock boy. Stock. Umm. I call him my whipping boy. It's usually with the clipboard. Right Jake. Tell him. It's usually, yeah. On the butt. Just. Scotty, we could share the office. Oh, wouldn't that be cozy? Jake, I don't want to share an office with you. I don't even want to share the same store as you. Come on. What was that all about? Scotty's dad just made Jake store manager. Okay. Scotty! Scotty! Scotty. This is too small a store to have this much tension. Yeah, well, you should have thought about that before you accepted my father's offer. It was your idea for me to meet with him. Yeah, because I felt sorry for your pathetic old, tired ass. Never dreaming you would stab me in the back. Jake! You're a bloody wuss, Jake. When are you going to learn to stand up for yourself? Scotty! I may be tired, I may be old, but I'm no longer pathetic. And I am your manager. If you've got a problem with that, then I will gladly, gladly reassign to another store. Do I make myself clear? Crystal? Another thing is no longer be needing this. Keep an eye on the store. I'm going out to lunch. Howard, give me my clipboard back. Howard. Okay. Did you get a promotion? Yeah. Then why the long face? I don’t know. I feel like I stepped on someone's toes to get there. It's a dog eat dog world, Jake. Remember that. You going to have a drink to celebrate. To play with my sobriety. Because you're such an easy target. I love me a man with strong backbone. The problem with Jake is he is a spineless, pushover. Well the perfect example is he didn't even go look for a better job before he took that loser position at the yellow bird. We get lots of freebies, though. Their fried chicken is to die for. Your mama doesn't eat fried chicken, Casey. Well, you don't know what you're missing. Ugh. You said, Jake. Was mean to you. Do you mean physically? Oh, no. But I read somewhere how mental anguish is equivalent to physical abuse. Casey knows I used to get my hair done at the beauty salon once a week. Now I can't even afford that. You are paying me today, right? Um. Hmm? Casey. Casey! Get back here. Why doesn't anybody ever listen to me? Cut! Nice job. No. People suck. Jake sucks, and all of my ex’s suck. And Rosa sucks. This pink towel! Who’s Rosa? Rosa is only the worst housekeeper on the planet, and she doesn't even speak a lick of English. I can’t stand it. I swear. I speak seven languages. That's make me a polyglot as for Ellie? She's ‘malvada.’ that is Spanish for evil. I was her nanny before she met Mr. Rush her housekeeper, and then was nanny for Casey. I came with a divorce settlement from previous marriage. I used to call Casey, ‘cerdita.’ that's Spanish for piggy. I used to call them a lot of things for making fun of me. But neither one of them knew what I was saying. I was about to quit when Mr. Rush came into the picture. He wasn't like others. Sap, Ellie married. He had heart and genuine feeling for her and little miss piggy. God only know why Ellie cheat on Mr. Rush for years. I never say anything, but I did warn him. I say if you stay with these women, they eat you up alive. Especially cerdita. I mean, I've been collecting. These recovery coins so long, I could open my own bingo joint. Sell them as chips. But all I got. Yeah. You look handsome. Bright eyes. Thank you. I just been promoted to manager. You go, girl. When are you going to leave your wife and marry me? Well, since the divorce come through, will be off. Famous last words. Jake. We haven't seen you in a while. You've been following the steps. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do my best. Don't slip up. It's a long journey to get back. On the right path. Yeah. So. Yeah, um. Hi, everyone. Hi Jake. Um. So as some of you know I've been going through a lot of drama in my personal life. Um. It's felt a lot like being swept up in a tornado, never knowing when you can land. When you do, you wake up dazed, confused when you feel you're going to find any. A sense of normality. Now to be honest, I. Umm. I really feel like getting wasted sometimes. You know, just a just don't have to deal with all this crap that keeps hitting the fan. But I gotta have faith that there’s gonna be a rainbow waiting for me at the end when this storm finally clears. Anyway. That's it. I really like the wizard of oz reference bright eyes, and I truly hope the yellow brick road leads you to your yellow bird. Did you say yellow bird. Yes. But I'm not talking about that schlock grocery store you work out. It means the one. True person you can't live without. Yeah. That’s funny, my mom just told me. Can’t believe I've never heard of it. That's the beauty of being sober, babe. You become aware of all the things he close to ears and eyes to when you were higher than a kite. Wish me luck. She seems like a nice girl. Jake! Pay attention. These are the overhead lights. These are all the department lights. Okay, this is deli. This is fish. This is meat. This is bakery and this is produce. All right. And you have 30 seconds after entering the security code to exit and lock up. Otherwise, it will leave the security company you don't want that. She is all yours, boss. Scotty, you know, I specialize in public relations. So how long to talk to your father and try and work something out so that, you know, maybe you stay the manager or. No, no. I keep doing what I'm doing. Jake, you have done me a huge favor. I don't have to listen to any more of these whiny employees. No more ticked off customers, not to mention getting up at the crack of dawn to open up this thing place. No you are store manager, Jake. Well done. Oh. Oh. Scotty. Scotty, you didn't give me the code for the alarm Oh. Thanks. All, done? What does this note say? Thanks. Sorry I’m late Mr. Rush. Oh, is everything okay? Um. I broke up with rusty. So I had to call my friend Amber for a ride. I’ll hurry to my register. Just take your time, okay? Oh, come in. What a dump. So you got my message? I’m here aren’t I? Well, what do you think? You want to work here? Define work? Well, umm. You can help manage my office and filing things, stuff like that. I like your girl Friday. Yeah, yeah, like my girl Friday. I don't know bright eyes. I don't really play well with others. Look, if anyone gives you any grief, you just let me know and I'll take care it. So what do you say? I say we replace that Scotty guys, picture with yours. That sounds good. Scotty. I'm just popping out for a bit, so can you. Keep an eye on things? Yeah, I know it's been a running routine with you lately, Jake. What's in that bag? None of your business. Jakey. My father owns the store. It is literally my business. Look. If you're so sick of working here and you don't like it, why don't you just quit? Jake? Are you deaf? Mike my dad owns the store. So what? I forget about your father. What is it that you want to do? What would make you happy? You wouldn't understand, Jake. Try me. Convince me. I do actually want to know what would make you happy. Eh. Mom, I get you some groceries. What are you looking for? The keys. The keys? The keys to this monstrosity. I want to drive cross-country. Just like your father promised me. Mom, your license expired ten years ago, and you're in no condition to drive. Then why am I even alive? Where did this come from? Oh, a real handsome gentleman. He look like Robert Goulet. Did you sign for this? Does Robert Goulet still perform? No. Because your father promised me that we were going to see him. In “man of la mancha” on Broadway. Him and Steven. Eddie in Las Vegas. Oh, and. And Sammy Davis Jr mom. Mom. Robert Goulet Sammy Davis Jr, Eydie Gorme. Whoever they are. Steve and Eddie. Mom! Did you sign for this? Where are the gloves, bright eyes? I don't want to catch anything. Namely a disease. Aisle eight, I think. Yeah. What's wrong? Well, Ellie, sent the divorce papers in and now my mother signed them, and now the clock is ticking. So I'm. Calling your lawyer. No I have to call my housekeeper. Deep breaths, bright eyes. You're going to give yourself worry lines. To late. Tough crowd. Oh, hello, Rosa. This is Jake rush. Yeah. I'm Ellie's husband. Yeah, I'm still married to her. Look, can you do me a favor? Can you take care of my mother for. Hello? Hello? Come on. What the hell? I work here. Yeah, right. You're kind works the streets. Oh. Whoa. What's going on? You're carny folk cashier here accused me of stealing these gloves. Oh, I'm the carny folk? Yeah. What's that make you a freak nature. To see what I mean? This will never work. Whoa, whoa, hey. Crystal. Crystal, please. Please come back. Paula, I hired crystal to help me with the office management. Okay. Ha! Jake? I never had anyone help me organize when I was store manager. No, you did, Scotty. Her name was Maggie Ryan. Remember her? She quit because you whacked her on the ass with that clip board of yours one too many times. Just the same way you've whacked the majority. Everyone standing here. But they were too afraid to say anything in case you fired them. Am I right? I asked you all a question. I'm all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. Okay. So we all don't have to be friends, okay? But we do need to work together. My job as the manager of the yellow bird is to create the best working environment possible. If you don't like it, there's the door alright? Paula? There's something I want to say to crystal. Sorry, miss. Me too. You're a man of your word, bright eyes. Thanks for defending me. It. It will get better. Um. I have to go. Sorry. She uh. She does that. I'm Becky. Crystal. That’s a pretty name. Thanks. I picked it out after my change. What did you change? I was born Craig. Oh. Oh! Like? Oh, wow! I never would have guessed. Well, as Dolly Parton says, it takes a lot of money to look this cheap no. I think you look really pretty. Thank you. How'd you meet Mr. Rush? We met in AA. Like, like the meetings? Uh. No, like the batteries. Oh. Oh, okay. Because I thought, like. Freddy? Hey! Sorry. Sorry. You could lose your head sneaking up on me like that. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Whatever. I don’t think we have met. I'm Jake, the new manager. Yeah, I know. I saw your name above the urinal in the men's room. This Jake rush is a wuss. Well, you know, he can't be everyone's friend when you're the new boss. Pish. Boss? When I think of a boss. I think of fat Tony two shoes or my cousin Vinny, not somebody who's afraid of their own shadow. I'm not afraid of my own shadow. You were saying? Is, is your cousin Vinny the same Vinny who's a lawyer? What's it to you? Well, I was talking to Howie before and I mentioned I need some legal advice. Would you kill somebody? No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm just going through a divorce. Good luck. I've been trying to divorce my old lady for the past 25 years, and she won't go away. You want me to give Vinny a ring? Uh. Yes. That would be great. Yeah. Alright. Okay. Becky, you’re still here? Yeah. Um waiting on my friend Amber to pick me up. She's running late. She's a manager at the dollar store. Oh. Do you want me to give you a ride home? I mean, that's probably not the best idea with the whole Paula thing and your divorce. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you're welcome to keep me company till Amber shows up. Okay? Don't do that. Can I ask you a personal question? Shoot. Um. Is your mother an alcoholic? I don't know. My mother's past, but I do know since the accident, she is dependent on painkillers. Those and diet coke. What's her name? Mary Jane. But her nickname was MJ MJ Dooley? Yeah. That was her maiden name. I just know that. Well. I. Uh. I. I dated her high school. No way. Yes, way. And we, look. Use to talk about running away and leaving Bailey heights together. And what happened? I went to college, and by the time I got back. She was married to your father? I guess. That's so crazy. You could have been my father. Yeah. When did uh. What did your parents separate? Oh, I was in grade school, but my mom says their marriage was on the rocks. Before I was even born. So. Why do you ask? Just. Just curious. There's Amber. It's good talking to you, Mr. Rush. Likewise. Hey, bozo. Hey, Heeey. Welcome back, rip Van winkle. What happened? Well, I came here to have that beer we talked about and found you laying out here in front of the store. Oh, yeah. That's a beauty, isn't ow! Disgruntled employee? No, a disgruntled boyfriend. Is there something you need to tell me? Oh, it's just. Becky, the cashier, her boyfriend thinks I have a thing for her. It’s a long story. Is she cute? Steve. She's like, 19. Oh, no, no. That's total. That’s jailbait. Material. Here. Drink up. I. I can’t. You can't? I'm. I'm an alcoholic. Sure. Oh, okay. All right. Yeah. Drink up. No, no, I. Look, Steve, I’m in AA. I'm following the steps. I just can't afford to slip. Wow. Damn, bro, you really are a changed man. I tell you, you're not the same babe magnet I knew in high school. I'll tell you that. Yeah well. Time catches up on all of us. I can't do anything about it. Speaking of time, you remember the high school reunion we went to 20 years ago? Yeah, I remember. I doubt you do. Yeah. You were falling down drunk. You left with, what's her name? What’s her face, that. MJ Dooley. Yeah. Becky. The cashier is my daughter. I. I see. I well. I think I'm. I think I'm her father. From that one night. Yeah, I mean, that's. That's all it takes. Okay. Wow, man. I mean, that that. Wouldn't that be a trip? Seriously? Seriously. You drink up. Whoo! Not again. Rusty! I am not. Sleeping with Becky it’s completely not what you think. If you knew the truth. The names Harper. I know you. Yeah. If you pull out the camera again, I'm going to sue you and my wife. I'm done with your wife. She lies. We got some incriminating footage that could prove beneficial to your divorce. Alright. Uh. Just meet me inside. Just, yeah. Take a seat. So, um. Why did you stop doing Ellie's reality show? Ellie ran out of money. I tracked down a few people she ranted about. Including your old housekeeper. She claims Ellie cheated on you during your marriage. That confession alone is gold to your case. Wow. Oh! That from rusty? Yeah. Good call. Um. So, how much do you want for the flash card? Ten grand. Ten grand. Harper. I don't have ten grand. It's how much the lawyer's going to cost you give or take a few bucks. I don't even have a lawyer. Whoa, you really are screwed. This here is your trump card buddy. But what if, uh. What if I get you a gig, that paid five grand? Would? You know. Could we call it even then? Vroom. Vroom, vroom. Where are you heading mom? Oh! Hollywood, I'm going to be a big movie star. Like Elizabeth Taylor. Is she still alive? Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's still working. She's doing a remake of cat on a hot tin roof. There's a cat on the roof. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. There's a there's a cat on the roof. Oh, sort it out when I get back. Oh, thanks. See ya. You won't see me. Jake. You're not going to see me ever again. Here we go. So we have the grand reopening coming up, and I've just got the go ahead for us to all shoot our very own TV commercial, and you're all going to be in it. Alright. Right on. Last time I was on TV, I was in a high speed car chase. Is there script? No, no, no. Is this going to be mostly a voiceover with you know, customers and some of the staff? And, you know, there might be a little bit of that. Yeah. Okay good. Because I hate memorizing lines. Cost me a show last fall at the Bailey heights community theater. Which show? Wicked? Bitch. Takes one to know one sweetie. Touché well. So. So which one of you is artistically inclined? I am. I can draw. Great Becky. Uh. So how about you help me paint some banners? We'll put them over the produce bins and bakery and meat departments and crystal? Would you like to maybe do hair and makeup? Yeah! What? What. What's hair and makeup? What's going on here? Jake's making a commercial and we're all going to be in it. Oh, well, does my father know about this, jakey? Yes, he did. He gave me the go ahead this morning. Look, I think that's the time. Everybody back to your stations. Have a great day remember to smile. And yeah. So how did you come up with that genius idea, Jake, filming a commercial? Well, it's a PR agent to me. And just for the record, your father thought this was a brilliant idea. Oh, he would. He loves clowns, loves magicians. He loves you. Mm. Hmm. What are you hiding, jakey? Those bloodshot eyes from a late night out with the Walker brothers. Hmm. You get it. Johnnie Walker, red and black. Give me my coffee. How about you finish that diaper display you're working on yesterday, and then you can have some more coffee. Okay. It’s old coffee anyway. Big baby. No you big baby. No, you are. Jerk. Here I come. What’s this? I brought it in to take a picture of you to replace his. Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh. That's bad timing. Why? Bright eyes! Please tell me you did not fall off the wagon and run into something. No, no, no. Still sober. I just had a run in with Becky's ex-boyfriend's fist. He's got it into his head that I have a thing for her. Eww. She's young enough to be your daughter. Yeah, uh. There's a good chance that she is. Is what? My daughter. See, I dated her mother in high school, and there was this high school reunion 20 years ago. You know, I was drinking back then. We kind of hooked up, and then one thing led to another and. Yeah. You sure know how to shatter a girl's romantic vision of love, bright eyes. Sorry. And here I thought I had a chance with you. Like all those small town girls in those hallmark movies. But you really are a breeder. Oh, hey, Freddy. Yo. Freddy who? Krueger. Got a minute? Sure, sure. Should I call 911? No, no, shush. Pest control? No, no, Krystal. This is uh. Freddy's cousin Vinny. Uh, you're Vinny the lawyer, right? How did you know that? Are you kind of resemble your cousin? I don't see it. Me neither. Um. I didn't know we had an appointment, so. I don't trust appointments. People miss appointments, and then I have to have moose here, break their legs. Run while your legs are still intact. Uh. Can I get you gentlemen a drink? Oh, sure. Scotch, single malt, if you have it. Uh, Krystal, do you mind getting them a drink? Okay. Thanks. Um. Oh, I like the way you swagger. Please uh. Take a seat. So tell me about this divorce of yours. Oh, well, my wife sent me the divorce papers, and they're being signed and I realize, legally I need to respond before the due date and. Well, yeah, that's where we're at. Soo, did your wife give you that black eye no, no, no. She didn’t. Uh. Too bad. Oh, let's see. You're a good husband Jake? Yeah, I like to think so. Yeah. Hmm. He says he'd like to think so. Have you read all these, uh, divorce papers? Uh. Yes. I mean, kind of. Yeah. Read them again. Carefully! Okay. Okay. There you go. Thanks. Toots. Now be like a banana and split. How old are you? Yeah. Sorry, Krystal. You could take the rest of the day off, work on the make up for the commercials or something. Gentlemen. Well, at least you've got one woman who listens to ya. Vinny? This. This last. Clause here is completely untrue. I can't believe I’m saying this. I never made sexual advances towards my stepdaughter. She was choking on a chicken bone, and I gave her CPR. That's all. That's how. That's. Yeah, you know, how about this Becky girl? Did you make advances towards her like your wife claims? No, no, no, no, no. That's completely untrue as well. She was giving me a massage just on the shoulders and one of the cashiers took a photo. Send it to my wife. It's just. Oh. Oh, really? Now? Hmm? Jake, do you have a 401k? I did, but my wife burnt through that as well. Now, that's too bad, because this is going to cost you a boatload of money. Your wife has solid grounds to get everything she's asking you for. If these accusations are true. As I told you, it's accusations are completely false. But. But there is some incriminating evidence on her. Oh. Where is it? Well, it's it's on a flashcard. What the hell is a flashcard? Well, it's something that a videographer uses to capture footage and stuff. So anyway, Ellie hired Harper, this videographer, to do a reality show, and apparently he saw something. You lost me at videographer. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is that it? If I give you more advice, I have to charge you more. You owe me 500 bucks. Wow, $500. Usually I charge a grand. But since you uh, offered the good stuff, I'm giving you a discount. I don't have $500. Oh! Who doesn't have $500 lying around? Can you believe this, moose? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't, don't. Don't, don't. Shoot, shoot, shoot what? It's time for my blood pressure and heart pills. Okay, look, I get paid on Friday. Jake, I told you I am taking blood pressure and heart pills. I could be dead by Friday. And so could you. If you don't pay up. Hey? What's in the bag? My mom's lunch? You coming back? Yeah. Why wouldn't I come back? Oh, now you're raking in that store manager money. You may want to go to a big city somewhere where the local yellow bird has its own website. You would like that, wouldn't you? Jake! It's the other door, Jake. Yeah, you got it. My lawyer says that your mama signed the divorce papers. Yeah, she did. Mm. Mm hmm. When are you going to deliver me mine? I won't like this to be over. Like yesterday. I'm still trying to find a lawyer. Perv! Ugh! Where did you get the shiner? So be honest. It was Becky's boyfriend. Well, it serves you right for sleeping with underage girls. Big perv. Hmm. Look, Ellie, this doesn't have to get ugly, okay? I'm happy to sell the house, and we split it 50/50, and we'll just call it a day. Uuummm. Well, that would be perfect in a perfect world. But you are far from perfect. You are a. You know what, Ellie? I feel sorry for you, you know, because one day you're going to wake up old and alone with nothing to show for your life. Well, so have me. Dork face. Yeah. Hello? Yes, this is Jake rush. Well, okay. That’s my mother. Which hospital? Okay, I’m coming. Your mother's a tough ol’ bird. She’ll pull through. Yeah, yeah. Everything she owned was in that Winnebago. You know, I wanted to move her into a home, but not this way. Change is good. Besides, everything in that Winnebago, was just things. Like the things in your own home. Jake. Sometimes when you let go of the past, it opens up a whole new world. Sorry, Scotty. I didn't call my. My mom's been in an accident. She okay? Yeah, she's she's a little shaken up, but she's going to pull through. Look, I can take over. It's not your job anymore, jakey. What? What do you mean? My dad's in the office. He’ll explain it to you. In the office. Lawrence? Jake. Scotty told me that you stole $500 out of the safe. Oh. Oh. Man. If you were going to go big, why didn't you just take everything inside? Oh, no, no, let me explain. Freddy butcher set me up with his cousin vinny. Who? Who's a lawyer. I use that term loosely, and he gave me some legal advice. However, he then wanted me to pay him $500 on the spot, and I didn't have the money, so I was. I was going to borrow it from the safe and pay it back later. And. Oh, you were just borrowing it. Oh, I was mistaken. How about this? Were you going to pay back this too? This is a $2,400 bottle of scotch. I was under some delusion that you were a recovering alcoholic. I am. I am. I didn't drink that. That was for vinny and his bodyguard. Oh, so what you're telling me is that you took it upon yourself to let the yellow bird pick up the tab for all of this chaos that's going on in your personal life? No. Let me finish. I. I. I like you, Jake. I liked you from the first day I met you. But this reckless disposition, it's just. It's a red flag. You could just snap at any minute, I can't afford to take that risk. So you're fired. But what about the commercial? I mean, everyone was so excited about doing it. There'll be no commercial. Oh, but. Already paid the deposit. I had payroll. Cancel that check. And that's. That's the bad news. There's good news. Yes. There is good news. I'm not reporting any of this to the corporate office. And I'm also going to put back the $500 into the safe out of my own pocket as far as this bottle of scotch shoplifter stole it. I don't know what to say. Let me say it for you. Clean up your act, find something that you're passionate about. And when you do contact me, I'll see if I can help. I. I have found something I'm passionate about. Lawrence. What is that? It’s the yellow bird. This. This store. The staff. The the people who I work with. I mean, it's like a family to me. I'm sorry, Jake. Scotty is my family. All right? And blood is thicker than water, so I, uh. I. I'm just going to let you gather your personal belongings. You want to check? It’s just my personal stuff. No, I trust you. You trust me now? Mm-hmm. Now, why don't you wait till I go back? So I can explain why I took that $500? Gut instinct told me you were running off and not coming back. Keys, jakey. You know, I thought you're sick and tired of dealing with whiny customers and ticked off employees, huh? Getting up at the crack of dawn to open this place? Yeah, but, you know, stocking shelves and building teepee pyramids. It's all so demeaning to me now. You know how I felt. Mr. Rush. Okay. I've been looking for you all day. I've got some cool ideas for the banner. What happened to your eye? Oh, um. I fell. I fell hard. You. Are you going somewhere? Yeah, I. I'm leaving the yellow bird. Why? No, we're all real excited to do the commercial. Even Paula, you know what a witch she can be. It's not by choice. What happened? So it's a long story, but Scotty got his old management job back. Back to the clipboard spankings. Oh, there's rusty. You’re back with rusty? Yeah. Umm. He swung by last night. We sort of work things out. He's really. He's really not all that bad. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Whatever makes you happy, I suppose so, umm. Take care of yourself, kiddo. You too. Oh, Becky, can you do me a favor? If you get a chance, can you? Can you ask your mom if she remembers seeing me at the high school reunion 20 years ago? Yeah. Okay. Becky, come on. Get in here. Bye Mr. Rush. Bye. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What in the bloody hell are you doing, Jake? I had a rough day. Boo hoo! Look, you don't understand. I just lost my job. My mom lost her home. I'm about to lose my home. I just. I just need to escape. Are you even trying to turn your life around, Jake? Yes. You! I’ve tried everything. It just doesn't work. Well, then try harder. You, you lousy excuse for a man. You can't talk to me like that. Oh, but, I can Jake. Because I'm the only one who can tolerate your moaning and woe is me attitude. And I had a rough day. Well, so did I! I've been stuck in this car baking in 80 degree heat with the sun beating down on me because you can't afford to fix that faulty sunroof that's been broken for the past five years. Not to mention that stench from your mother's lunch. I'm over it, Jake. Yeah! Well that makes two of us. Oh, this is my sendoff? After all I've done for you, you're throwing me in a dumpster with meat scraps and old produce. Why don't you join me, Jake! Cause god knows you don't have to nickels to rub together to Bury your own sorry ass. Tell me, what is there left to fear? The yellow bird jakey. It defines a person's true love. The one person they can't live without. If you find that joy, you are the luckiest person in the world. Oh, crap. Man. You know, jakey. They say getting crapped on by a bird is good luck. Screw you, Scotty. I'm going to use that hose whether you like it or not. And I don't like it. Oh, what are you going to do, fire me? No, no jakey. I have a bad idea. I want you to come inside and take a shower and then put this on. Okay. I'll make some coffee. Careful. Watch what you're doing. That is money. There. Has anybody seen Scotty? He's in his office. Just get back to your stations. Yes, sir. Is there something y'all know that I don't? This better be some kind of a joke. No, no joke. Pops, please sit down. There's something important that I need to tell you. I wanted jakey here. We'll talk when he's gone. No, we'll talk now. Please sit down. Make it fast. I have another meeting. To attend to. Yes, I know. This business comes first with you. It always has. Which is one of the main reasons that mom left because you paid more attention to your stores than you did to her. Scotty, I don't like your tone of voice. Well, maybe that's because I never had a voice. Dad for the past ten years, I have begged you to let me be a hairdresser, and you always shut me down, calling it a sissy job. It is a sissy job. Not you know what?! This conversation. It's over. Oh, Laurence, if you walk out that door, you're going to lose your son forever. You know what? You. You. I want you out. I don't want you interfering in anything that you know nothing about. This has nothing to do with you. No, no. That's where you're wrong. When I told my father I wanted to be in publicity, he shut down my dreams. Said he wanted me to follow in his footsteps. And being salesman. But I knew if I did that, I would never be content. The same way I know Scotty's never going to be content doing what he's doing here at the store. At this store. This store! And all of the stores and the chain is Scotty's legacy. And I’ll guaran-damn-tee you, it's a hell more than your old man left you. Pops! No, no, it's okay. Look. Your father's right. Look, my father is a degenerate gambler that left my mom and me with squat. But you know the one thing he taught me, Lawrence? He taught me how to be humble. He always said to me that life is simpler if you just don't judge other people. But I. I will be forever grateful for the fact that you didn't call in corporate office with what went down a week ago. I don't know. Just. Work things out with Scotty. None of us are promised another tomorrow. Thank you jakey. Ugh. So. You. You really want to be a hairdresser? More than you know. Guess, who just got his own pop up hair salon at the yellow bird. This guy. Yay. There goes the neighborhood. Mr. Rush! I heard about your meeting. I'm sorry you didn't get your old job back. Yeah, Scotty tried, but his dad won’t budge. Well, speaking of dads, I spoke to my mom last night, and she remembers going to your high school reunion, like, 20 years ago, and she suspects the same thing you do. Only was too afraid to say it. So. Oh. Okay. I'll. I'll take a paternity test. I I'd rather you didn't. Not now, anyway. I mean, like, why ruin a good thing in case you're not? You know, deep down, I. I know who you are. Don’t be a stranger on us will ya. I won’t. Jake! Lawrence? I want to thank you. What for? Giving me a lesson in humility. So. Welcome back. That is, if you still want to work, here? Is that even a question? Good. Good. We can insert this into the edit and if any of the staff, you know, screw up their lines, just keep rolling. You got. Uh. Yeah, I'll be back. Mom! Jake! Oh. Lawrence. Ready to shoot a commercial? Yep. Almost ready. All right. Jakey! Jakey! Look at me. I'm flying. Hahaha. Yeah, that. That’s. Oh. I demanded a raise. Oh, well, that's my mom. And that's her caregiver. Where’s Scotty? He's in the break room doing everyone's hair and make up. Well, it's not exactly what I wanted for him to choose as a profession, but, hey, if it makes him happy, then so be it. Well, you know. That's what life's all about, is finding that one true passion that you have in life pursuing that. Are you going to stay around for the commercial? No, I'm going to wait and see the finished product. I want to be surprised right. Whoohoo! Catch me if you can. Get back here. Loco old lady. Yeah, I've gotta. Mom! So yeah, if you take a shot down there, that would be really, really good. And I just. Just give me a sec, rusty. Hey, Mr. Rush. Listen, um, I really am sorry about punching you last week. Right? Yeah, that's. That's fine. No, no, no, it wasn't. Becky really likes you in a father sort of way. I get that now. No hard feelings. No hard feelings. Cool. Oh, hey. So you think it'd be cool if I stay. And watch the shoot? Yeah, sure. Oh, cool. Alright. Actually, do you have a job? Oh, well, I've had many jobs, but none really liked. Or kept I mean. Would you. Ah, you like to work here? Well, I mean, I guess that’d be cool. Would you like to be in a commercial? Yeah. Last time I was on TV was a high speed chase. Let me guess. With Howie, right? Yeah, he was best buddies at school. All right. Come on, let's suit you up. It's awfully puffy. Oh, trust me, Paula, you look fabulous. Yeah. Someone's going to get lucky in the bedroom tonight. With what? My cat. My husband died five years ago. Oh, my god. I am so sorry. Don’t be. He snored like a bear and ate like one too. Scotty! Pops. I had no idea you would be here. I just want to swing by and check out your new found profession okay. What do you think? Hmm? I. I think. I think you're on to something. Thanks, pops. Can I have everyone at the front of the store? Oh, I'm not ready. Can you do my makeup? Okay. This is your brush. Okay, so the main thing is, is that everyone should just smile and have fun and, well, just a get to your places. Becky you. You look beautiful. Thank you. I feel beautiful. Krystle's like a fairy godmother. I hate you, Jake, rush I hate you with a passion. So, uh. Are you one of the extras? Excuse me. I'll have you know that I want to have my own reality show. Well, I don't watch reality shows. I'm too busy overseeing my store's. You own the yellow bird stores? Yes, ma'am. All ten of them. Oh. Lets do it. My car. Are you married, Mr. Finley? Lawrence Finley. And as a matter of fact, I'm divorced. Miss Ellie. Miss Ellie. By a chance. Have you had dinner yet, miss Ellie? Because I know this great steakhouse at third and hollinger. Well, I do love me. A piece of aged meat. Will follow me. To the ends of the earth. Keep up the good work. I'll be damned. What's wrong?
