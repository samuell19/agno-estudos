You will see that it's not as bad as it's made out to be, out to be. We can go, go on some magic carpet trip. And I know we're into love and partnership. Wait and see what the pleasures of the world can really be with me. Come play with me. Take me by the hand, and stay with me. Come away with me. Play with me. Come play with me, got to make you wanna stay with me. What do you say to me? Play with me. Take control, don't need to go mad impatiently. Don't you know it's gonna be love, just you and me? Take your time. Take it easy, and the better it will be. You'll see. Take your time. Take it easy, and the better it will be. You'll see. Come play with me, got to make you wanna stay with me. What do you say to me? Play with me. Come play with me, got to make you wanna stay with me. What do you say to me? Play with me. Come play with me, got to make you wanna stay with me. What do you say to me? Play with me. NARRATOR: Yanne could have been a fashion designer. But instead, she chose the profession which from time immemorial has born the dark tint of shame, except, that is, in the countryside of Normandy. A man of honor like Colonel de Granville could never have contemplated marriage to Mademoiselle Yanne had he not heard he'd compromised himself by staying overnight at her house. But he could never have foreseen how his life would be transformed by this incident. Otherwise, he would never have provoked the rumors which were eventually to force them to the altar. Since Yanne is now a widow and no longer bound by the ties of marriage, her two young nieces, Julie and Florence, have come to stay with her. She treats them as friends but nevertheless maintains a certain distance. [MUSIC PLAYING] But these young ladies are not as cultured as she is, nor have they had her experience of life or of love. They have a rather different approach to both. Good morning, little birds. [SIGHS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, how bored I am. Breakfast is ready, Baptiste. BAPTISTE: Right, Ms. Ninette. Did you sleep well? Yes, but all alone. BAPTISTE: Tonight will be different. Not so loud. BAPTISTE: Come on. You know you like it. That's true. Your coffee's getting cold. - All right. Don't you want this coffee? - My mind's on other things. - Mmm. Like this? That's more like it. Well? Tonight, you won't be alone. You can bet on it. [GIGGLES] Yeah, we get all the dirty work 'round here. Oh. [VOCALIZING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [HORSE NEIGHING] Flo, wake up. Aunt Yanne has been up for ages. - I don't care. It'll soon be 10 o'clock. So what? [SOFT MOANING] Cut it out. [MOANING] Ms. Ninette, the vegetables. She's still asleep. Well, well. Ah. Hi, my sweet. Darling. It was about time. - What if your boss comes in? - Oh, let her. As you wish. [MOANING] [MOANING] MADAME YANNE (VOICEOVER): That's how we Colonel liked it, all these memories of happiness we shared. Darling. [LOUD MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Excuse me, Madame, for interrupting your entertainment, but I'm a gentleman and a friend. A beautiful woman like you shouldn't have to entertain herself. I offer my services. MADAME YANNE: You are very kind, sir. My warmest thanks. MAN: The pleasure is all mine, Madame. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] You are very kind, sir. MAN: Do you like that? Oh, yes, it's wonderful. I love it. MAN: It's wonderful for me, too. MADAME YANNE: It's marvelous. [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Mmm, Julie. [SOFT MOANING] You're so hot. [MOANING] Come on. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Oh, god, you're beautiful, Julie. You mean it? Oh, don't stop. Come on. Come on, yes. I'm fainting. [MOANING] [GASP] Will you stop that immediately? There are men for that. FLORENCE: Yes, Aunt, you're right. It's easy to say, especially for girls as well brought up as we are who aren't interested in old men with heart conditions. Some men. Come on. Let's carry on with our game. [LAUGHING] BOTH: (SINGING) Where have all the young men gone? Long time passing. [GRUNTING] BOTH: (SINGING) Where have all the real men gone? [LAUGHING] [VOCALIZING] I think we've made a hit, there. You may be right. I'm not sure what they want, but they're going to get it. Good idea. Hey, you. Yes? Let's go, Jacque. OK, come on. [GIGGLING] Hey, wait a minute. Come on back here, you two. - Save your breath. Let's get after them. You get the blonde one, George, all right? [MUSIC PLAYING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Up there. Yes, in the hay. What are those fools doing now? We're the fools, running after them. [GIGGLING] [SHUSHING] Come on, Jacque. I've had enough of this. They're here somewhere. They're not even nice looking. What difference does it make in the dark? One of them's too fat for me. And the other's too skinny. Come on, Jacque. They're making fools of us. Oh, what a pity. They're giving up. That's too bad. What do you mean? We're too good for these peasants. We're better off as virgins, are we? [LAUGHING] Who said I was a virgin? Oh, what a sense of humor. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] JULIE (VOICEOVER): [SPEAKING FRENCH] JULIE (VOICEOVER): [SPEAKING FRENCH] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [MOANING] [MOANING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [OWL HOOTING] Let's go for a gallop to the bridle path in the forest. It's Aunt Yanne's favorite ride. Out of the question. We might bump into her. - So what? She'll probably tell us to leave the horses alone and go out looking for men. It's too bad you haven't got one hidden away somewhere. We could have given her a surprise. I could get one if I tried. [BIRDS CHIRPING] And yours-- is he really a forest inspector? I'll introduce him to Aunt Yanne as if he were the spoils of battle. You know, an inspector of forests-- that's a almost a colonel. How did you get him? Oh, when Auntie's friend was out of the room for a while, I give him one of my meaningful looks. You're the man of my dreams. And he fell for it? Of course. You lucky thing. I'm telling you, he's twitching like a fish out of water. And you keep him twitching, I'll bet. He's gasping for it. Don't keep him waiting too long, Florence. Just as long as it amuses me. Is he really as young and good looking as that? Oh, yes, a bit provincial, perhaps. And is he well off? Oh, that's not the kind of thing you can ask. And as long as a man is sexy, I don't care about his money. We'll find out soon enough, won't we? Come to think of it, I could go and visit him today. Don't trouble yourself on my account. Don't worry. I won't. A poor little orphan girl like me has to think of her future. And that's what I'm doing. You're quite right. Oh, look, the horse is getting excited. Say hello to him for me. I'll be delighted. I'll be curious to see this Greek god of yours. He'll be absolutely over the moon when he sees me coming. Well, at least a young forest inspector's better than an old colonel. I couldn't agree with you more. But you mustn't say anything to Aunt Yanne. It's a surprise. - Not a word. Au revoir. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [WOODPECKER SOUND] You're a beautiful mare, Diana. The colonel would be proud to have a fine mare like you in his stables. Who's that? - It's me, Julie. - Mmm. [GRUNTING] Hm. JULIE: Calm down, Diana. Oh, hi, Erik. ERIK: Should I rub her down for you? Must you? ERIK: That's what I'm here for. JULIE: She doesn't need it. All right. But you're not going to keep your cap on, are you? [PLAYFUL LAUGHTER] Oh, it's beautiful. Long blond hair like that, you shouldn't keep it covered up. JULIE: Oh, that's just flattery. ERIK: That's not my style, mademoiselle. I waited a long time for this opportunity to talk to you. And now, I'm going to tell you what I think. First, mademoiselle is a lady and should take off that man's tunic, which hides her good points. And now, take off your blouse. I suppose a groom is not distinguished enough to give you a hand. Mmm. JULIE: You're completely crazy, Erik. ERIK: Maybe I am, but I could never have hoped for this. I'm not a man for fine words, but I know what to do when the situation arises. Oh. JULIE: Now, it's your turn to show me something, or was it all talk? Ah, a great wine, wine from the vineyards of southern France, an aristocratic wine of great nobility, a true and loyal companion. I'll appreciate it for the rest of my life. We'll grow old together, you and I. A noble wine is the best friend a man can possibly have. [UNSTEADY BREATHING] JULIE: Oh, Erik. Erik. [MUSIC PLAYING] Erik. [YELLS] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Erik. [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SOFT MOANING] Erik. ERIK: [SPEAKING FRENCH] JULIE: Come, Erik. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] Erik. [LOUD MOANING] Erik. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Florence. Simon. I'm so glad to see you. What a wonderful surprise. I'll get out some wine, and we'll celebrate. Yes, what a good idea. I'm thirsty. My mouth is so dry. Make yourself at home. FLORENCE: Aunt Yanne mustn't know I came here. An eligible bachelor should only receive the young lady in the drawing room. Don't worry. It's about time I made the acquaintance of your Aunt Yanne. She's probably not as puritanical as you seem to think. FLORENCE: Ah, she's a respectable widow. There's not much you can teach a widow. After all, she doesn't have to defend her virtue. It's quite different in your case. You have everything to lose, huh? Uh, take off my boots. There's a darling. SIMON: My dear, you should remember you're no longer a child. FLORENCE: I do remember, darling. [GIGGLE] And I'm a grown man. I can see that. But you do understand. Do I make my position clear? I think you do. But what are you doing? Why do you look so worried? SIMON: Me? I thought you were a man. SIMON: I am, but we should be married. FLORENCE: Exactly. So isn't it about time we started to get to know each other intimately? After all, you should see what you're getting. SIMON: Right. I'll show you what a real man can do. I'll show you what a man is made of. FLORENCE: You take my breath away. Yes? FLORENCE: Somehow, I always imagined it would be a bit more romantic. SIMON: Romantic? Classic is more like it. Think of me as Adonis. But it's not Adonis I want. It's you, Simon. Well, I want a man, a real man, and not a show-off who struts and preens like a peacock. [SOFT MOANING] You're so soft, my love. [MOANING] Oh, yes. Oh, my Darling. Oh, yes, that's it. That's nice. Do you like that? Yes, yes. Oh, yes. [MOANING] Simon, you're so big and strong. [HORSE NEIGHING] [OWL HOOTING] JULIE: Florence, where are you? Erik. [SOFT MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, Erik. But it can't be true-- oh, Auntie Yanne, the guardian of our virtue. [BREATHING HEAVILY] FLORENCE: Having a good time? And you? FLORENCE: Oh, yes, hot from Simon's bed. I had a taste of the future. Did the Earth move? It's better that way. Well, that's just about the way it was. I had a hard time getting him going. He's not exactly a smooth-talking lover, a bit slow at first. And then? Well, go on. What happened then, after that? Mm. Tell me about it. You seem very reluctant to talk about it. Or is the question indiscreet? [HESITATING] I'm always frank with you. Hm? Oh, be secretive if you like. Well, I can have secrets from you, too. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [LAUGHING] Hey. Oh. Hey, Ajax. Hey. Hey. ERIK: Ajax seems to be in great form, hey, mademoiselle? Yes, Erik. ERIK: The rider is also in form, if I may say so. God, there's a woman for you. She rides like the devil. She's scared of nothing and nobody. Mmm. That horse is the apple of my eye. I groom him every morning and every night. [GRUNTING] Hey. Hey. I'm going back to the stables, Erik. You can come and do your grooming now, if you like. [DOG BARKING] ERIK: What am I supposed to do with this, mademoiselle? What does this mean? [SOFT MOAN] I don't understand these games you play, women of your class. When the mare is in heat, the stallion is always ready to oblige. [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] FLORENCE: [SPEAKING FRENCH] Very well, inspector. Come in, please. Madame will be with you in just a minute. Merci. [PARROT SQUAWKING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] SIMON: Madame. Oh. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Simon Canard. Please accept these simple flowers-- Thank you. --as a token of my esteem. I assume that I'm not the object of your visit. I have two charming nieces who are very attractive. To be very frank with you, it's Florence that I come to see. That's all very well. But what are your intentions? They are very serious. As her guardian, I have to have some proof of that. You do understand, don't you? - But of course. - This way, please. With great pleasure, Madame de Granville. I'm sure you'll find my credentials in order. I'm sure you're very thorough, inspector. You'll see. The door on the left. Mmm. I'm sure you'll prove yourself a worthy member of the family. I'll do my best. We'll soon see, I hope. At your service, Madame. We're an honored family. But I'm the one who's honored. Very well. So far, you're doing fine. So far, yes. There's a risk in marrying someone so young. Don't worry. I'm a man in my prime. Do you feel able to satisfy the desires of a woman? I ask nothing better than the chance to prove it. Well, now is your chance. SIMON: I am deeply grateful to you, Madame. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHING] [SOFT MOANING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, wait for me. JEAN: But it was Madame that I came to see. What a beautiful day, just right for the harvest. Bonjour. - Bonjour. I came to ask you if we should have held the crop as it stands. - Oh, yes? Well, why not? After all, it's just as profitable that way. Yes, and maybe the corn crop as well. I think that would be best. It's your money, not mine. But those horses of yours must cost a fortune. We all have our weaknesses, huh? Those who can afford it. Well, there's enough hay in the barn. Yes, if we keep selling crops. Of course. You can see for yourself how much is left. After you, Madame. Mind your feet. It's all right, Jean. Those shoes were not designed for walking in barns. I'll just have a look. Yes, go ahead. Five layers at about a thousand, that makes around 5,000 francs. Oh, my god. What's wrong? Madame, are you ill? Tell me what it is. Your heart beats strong. You'll be all right. You fainted. I often feel faint when I'm near a handsome man. It always muddles my head. There's no need to feel faint just because you find me handsome. We'll soon find a cure for you. It's not often I have the opportunity to pluck such a delicate flower. Such fragile beauty requires delicate handling. What a lucky man I am. I can't tell you how happy it makes me that you have chosen me. Believe me, I have. Ah, Madame. [MOANING] What a beautiful park, a feast for the eyes. Even better, monsieur. You can feast your eyes on my niece, Julie. Julie. What do you think of her, monsieur? [NERVOUS LAUGHTER] Faced with a veritable goddess, what can a poor mortal say? Well, you could always offer to paint her a picture. My pleasure. You won't mind if I tell you you look even prettier without the dress? Quite the contrary. Of course, an artist always sees the body in the purest light. The Mayan naked is eternally pure as long as she remains the creation of an artist. As from this moment, you become my creation. Every inch of your body becomes mine. [SOFT MOANING] Your bosom is my refuge. And your little nest becomes my hiding place, dark and deep. JULIE: But you're not acquainted with my nest, yet you speak as if you knew it intimately. Does the contact with the model remain purely spiritual? Hm. I always thought artist and model had to be as one in the purest sense. [SOFT MOANING] There are certain advantages in being a mere mortal. [SIGHING] [MOANING] Does your goddess disappoint you? No, she's just as I hoped. Is that true? Oh, how nice it is. [MOANING] Oh, yes. Oh, my angel, I can't tell you how much you inspire me. Yes? Oh, goddess, take me with you to paradise. [HEAVY MOANING] You are complete now. Nature has paid to your just tribute. My goddess, my Maya, my muse, my Venus. Now you are clay in the hands of the artist-- Entirely. --to do with as I choose. [ROOSTER CROWING] - Madame Yanne. - Erik. ERIK: What a lovely hat. I haven't seen you around for some time now. I have to change my clothes, and there's no one in the house to help me. It's very clammy today. I'm frightened of thunderstorms, you know. In here with you, I feel protected somehow. Mm. MADAME YANNE: You don't mind if I keep you company for a while, do you? [MOANING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] ERIK: Are you leaving so soon, Madame? Jesus, now I've done it. I hope I don't get into any trouble. [MUSIC PLAYING] You rang, Madame? Who else would have rung? Madame? MADAME YANNE: I need you here. Get undressed. What have you been up to all day? NINETTE: I was helping the gardener. The gardener? Yes. MADAME YANNE: So you've had your eye on Baptiste, too, have you? Hm? You really are a little tart, aren't you? Gaston, Erik, now Baptiste-- you should restrain yourself a little. When you get married, you can get up to anything that takes your fancy. Why throw it all away now? NINETTE: But I feel happiest with you, Madame. MADAME YANNE: You still like me as much? Mhm. MADAME YANNE: Because I'm still very fond of you, much too fond, I'm afraid. That's why you think you can get away with anything. Who knows? Maybe you had the colonel, too. Never. MADAME YANNE: No, maybe you thought it wasn't worth the effort. NINETTE: I never thought of it. Liar. NINETTE: Honest, I swear it. MADAME YANNE: That's another lie. It's the truth. I promise. Little Ninette. I need your affection, Madame. Why do you mistrust me so? Forgive me. Yes, but you always hurt me. Be quiet now. Shh. Maybe it's better if I go away. No, stay with me. Come and help me take my bath. Yes, Madame, if that's what you really want. I want you to stay with me, the way we always were. Yes, we've had good times together, haven't we? I don't know. It's not like it used to be. We need a master in the house again, Madame. And what about my freedom, Ninette? It only brings you loneliness. You brood too much. Ninette seems to be quite a little philosopher. However, her diagnosis is very accurate. You're getting more and more melancholy. So you think I should remarry? If I was a widow and felt anything at all for men, I would think about it. You'd understand? Up to a certain point. You know, I envy you. You're so attractive, and you've never been enslaved by a man. You have legs that drive everyone crazy. Oh, yes, including you? - Including me, of course. - Really? They're gorgeous. Ah, Yanne. Oh, if only I hadn't such a weakness for men. They're so persuasive. You're rather persuasive yourself. Yanne, you obviously need both. Variety is the spice of life, and that needn't change if you get married. - Come on. Let's go upstairs. As you wish, my dear. After all, we must be careful not to offend the sensibilities of others. You know how prudent I can be. Every time I go up this staircase, I feel like a young bride. Don't tease, Ann. Now is not the time. Well, here we are. There's no one home. Good. [SOFT BREATHING] A visitor, Madame. Not now. I told him so, but he just came in. He wants to speak to you. It's important. You can go. Forgive me, Madame Yanne, for bursting in like this. You couldn't have picked a more inconvenient moment. Maybe it could wait till later. - I'll wait, if you prefer. - Yanne. Very well. In here, please. You can wait here. Thank you, Madame. [MUSIC PLAYING] ANN: I hope he's not the one you're going to marry. [MOANING] JEAN: What are they doing in there? [MOANING] ANN: Yeah, honey. MADAME YANNE: Come on. Come on. Yes. Oh, it's you. JEAN: Good morning, mademoiselle. Sorry to disturb you. I've got to get a book from the shelf up there. Don't mind me. Madame Yanne asked me to wait in here. Oh, I see. Is she very busy? - As always. Where has that Mirabeau got to? Ah, there it is. Do you know this book? [SPEAKING FRENCH] The forest inspector suggested I read it. That's your fiance, isn't it? That's right. Sit down. Thanks. I will. Do you know Mirabeau? I'm afraid not. As Simon says, he raises the veil on the secrets of sex. Uh-huh. But you probably know them already. Nice drawings, aren't they? JEAN: I didn't realize they went that far in those days, I mean, so explicit. [GIGGLES] FLORENCE: Oh, much more so than now. Compared to those days, we're backward and prudish. Can you imagine being painted doing that with Auntie Yanne? JEAN: And with you, mademoiselle? FLORENCE: Oh, and here with Julie and me. JEAN: We would kill ourselves laughing. We don't have great literature like that nowadays. They could teach us all a lesson. Don't you think so? Oh, Jean. Hm? I see. Bursting in like that, you did it on purpose. You did it to spite me. You must pay. You can take it out on me. You're used to it. It doesn't bother you. I know you. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Oh, Jean. [MOANING] What are you doing in the drawing room? I usually see you in the kitchen. Mademoiselle Ninette was out, so I thought I'd bring the fruit up myself, Madame. Oh, personal service? I ask nothing better than to be of service to Madame. I have great respect for you, if I may say so. But of course you may, Gaston. I trust that my friendship with Mademoiselle Ninette doesn't distress you? If so, I'd give her up at once, I assure you. I understand. But please bear in mind that I am always at your service. That's nicely put. It's not just talk, Madame. I really mean it. I think you could perhaps, um, show your sincerity. Mmm. Madame, I'm ready to prove it in any way you wish. Oh, you know, there's no particular hurry. It's just a manner of speaking. I'm a man of my word. And I'm always prepared, if you like to back it up with action. Make no mistake about it, Gaston. Don't misunderstand me. - Oh, that's clear enough. - Hm. In here, Madame Yanne? Now, show me how sincere you can be. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOANING] Take a little dessert to the countess. She's not here often, and I don't want her to feel left out. NINETTE: Very well, Madame. For you, Madame. Ah, thank you. Don't go, child. Stay with me a while. I feel rather lonely. [GIGGLES] Oh, how delightful. You're wearing garters. MADAME YANNE: A coffee for Gaston, Ninette. NINETTE: Straight away, Madame. MAN: But my dear, you must keep the horses. You know they're your pride and joy. [LAUGHTER] Darling. [MOANING] JULIE: The colonel was always finding fault with Aunt Yanne. Oh, bravo. Let's drink to three happy couples. But champagne makes me sad. Huh. MADAME YANNE: We'll open the bottle. I'm longing to see Simon let his hair down. JULIE: Oh, yeah, and now for some fun. Everybody take cover. Bravo. GERARD: Bang, another virgin gone. JULIE: Oh, Gerard. GERARD: What have I done? JULIE: Control yourself. GERARD: I wasn't talking about you. JULIE: When I think of your usual precious manners. GERARD: We've hardly got engaged, and now my first taste of nagging. JULIE: That's just a start. And it gets worse. GERARD: We won't get to that stage. SIMON: Let's drink to that. Of course, I'm a model fiance. A toast to the ladies. MADAME YANNE: Live ones. JULIE: This engagement party's going straight to my head. FLORENCE: OK, silence for a speech. I'm very happy to see that we're all here together. My nieces always considered that I was too severe with them, perhaps. But they have found worthy fiances who will stand firm by them. And it's thanks to my severity that their future happiness will be assured. I protected them like the delicate creatures they are. My great pleasure is to have found the man of my life after such a long period of widowhood, a man who has reawakened in me the capacity to love. JEAN: Darling, I thank you for the compliment. SIMON: I hope I'm as worthy of Florence. GERARD: And I of Julie. Let's drink to that. Will you marry me? I thought you'd never ask. Let's go and tell Madame. SIMON: That was a lovely speech, Aunt Yanne. JULIE: Congratulations to you both. GASTON: Madame, may we ask you for your blessing? From now on, you must love her and provide for her always. I will. A woman must grow up sometime. I'm ready. You can always come back if he doesn't behave. MAID: Don't worry, Madame. I will. Gaston, your duties start here. We'll soon see about that. Now, you little minx, if I decide to go on strike, what happens? You wouldn't do that. [LAUGHTER] You're right. I can't resist you. There. You're a man, after all. That depends on the woman. Happy now? I'm not without my weaknesses, of course. Ah, that's more like the old Simon. Absolutely typical. JULIE: And that's a reason for divorce. GERARD: Another other illusion shattered. What happened to the sensitive girl you got engaged to? You'll forgive me. Won't you? I might. SIMON: My sweet little girl, forgives me. GERARD: Just a moment. Didn't she say "might"? SIMON: Come on, my darling. We're going. But first, tell the company that you forgive me. FLORENCE: All right, I do. SIMON: You all heard that. I've been pardoned. And I look forward to sweeter rewards. JULIE: Sleep well, Florence. Men are strange creatures, aren't they? [PARROT SQUAWKING] FLORENCE: Are you awake? SIMON: Reconciled? We might be later. You always say might. Well, I have to restrain you somehow. Come on. We're not going to argue. No, we're going to make love. About time we were leaving, too, angel, hm? Indeed, my dear. MADAME YANNE: Everybody is leaving us. GERARD: With your permission, we have pressing matters to attend to. Good night, Jean. Sleep well. - Let's go now. - At once. She really looks like a goddess. Good night, Countess. ANN: We'll stay together a while, you and me, hm? NINETTE: I'd love to, Countess. Let's try another room for variety. Come, my dear. We won't disturb the bride and groom. NINETTE: They'll never notice. ANN: I feel rather superfluous here, anyway. You have such a nice figure, my dear, and such beautiful legs. [MOANING] SIMON: Florence. MADAME YANNE: How nice to have the house to ourselves, Jean, just you and me. JEAN: And now you have a man to satisfy your every need. Yes, Jean. JEAN: You can depend on it. MADAME YANNE: How nice. Up until now, my life has been an act of self-denial. JEAN: Apart from the little treats you gave yourself now and then. MADAME YANNE: They were always forced on me. I gave in only after a heroic struggle. Let's go to bed. The colonel's favorite words. Perhaps, but the rest of the story will be different. I'm sure it will. Help me to forget him, Jean. I'll do my best. Let's drink to that promise. Let's drink to us. The past is buried. The colonel's wife is no more. [LAUGHTER] Oh, yes, let's go to bed. You're so beautiful in that dress, I can hardly contain myself. No, not here, Jean. We'll be disturbed. But they've all gone. Yes, to bed. Where do you think? [MOANING] What did I tell you? [MOANING] [LAUGHTER] Well, they can do what they want. As for us-- - Come here. I'll take this off. No, I'll do it. Well, I'll take this off. I could hardly believe this moment has finally come. It has. And now that it has, I don't want anything to change. Oh, I'm not so sure about that. Oh, so that's why you kept the dress on. Yes. It's nice this way. Yeah. [MOANING] Oh, yes. Oh, Jean. [MOANING] Jean. Oh, Ninette, my little play thing. Yes. [SOFT MOANING] You drive me wild. Let me love your breast. Yes. [MOANING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] [SPEAKING FRENCH] Now, Erik, three's a crowd. (IN SURPRISE) Erik! Look, he's saluting. His intentions are clear. He is comfy, after all. [MOANING] Erik! I can't take anymore. [MOANING] You made her happy. Thank you. How can I thank you? - How? - Yes. - That's easy. - No. - Oh, yes. - No. No. [SOFT MOANING] THEME SONG: Come, baby, play with me. Come on, come on. Take me by the hand. You and me can go to some strange erotic land. You will see that it's not as bad as it's made out to be, life with me. We can go, go on some magic carpet trip. And I know we're into love and partnership. Wait and see what the pleasures of the world can really be with me. Come play with me. Take me by the hand, and stay with me. Come away with me. Play with me. Come play with me, got to make you wanna stay with me. What do you say to me? Play with me.
