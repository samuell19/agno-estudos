Rascals! Parasites of the world! Sir you're just a bit of walking sternum. What right do you have to bother me? You have all the scientists of the world on your back, Professor. You mean the merchants. The temple is polluted. I'm going away. The nations of the world are going to covet the Annulator then. I already said it. The world is not for sale. Whom is the world personality you admire the most ? Dracula ! The Annulator could bring you the Nobel prize. Is it true, Professor ? Professor, how do you see the next war? It will be as I want it to be. It is said you're pursuing your researchs alone. Is it true? A last word of conclusion ? Good night! Delicious music! Marvelous! Don't you think? Sylvaine? It's time. Yes, father. All is ready, father. I was waiting for the end of the piece. You're in love with this music, aren't you? From now on it will be our daily bread. Thank you, father. Other people's lives have ceased to exist for us. I belong no more to this horde of merchants. Our reason will not go beyond the walls of that house. You seem to be scared by the life style I'm proposing you. Did the people on the outside mean so much to you? Do you know why your mother had married to me? For my beauty... and my virility. Good night, father. What are you thinking about? On your guard! At ease. Good. Almost very good. However the gesture should be more silent. For the quickness you're perfect. The music doesn't smooth your reactivity. But, if you please, with more serenity. So. In 57 seconds initiation will begin. Hide your instruments. Soften the lights. The amazing discovery of Von Krantz and then his strange resignation... ...are worrying the scientist's world community. That's good. Believe me. To buy Von Krantz or to take the Annulator formula by force we need a scientist. When his name was Bobby Kuhn in the Wehmacht Bobby Gun was attached to the chimical experience service. As you know Bobby Gun is now working for us. He's one of our best agents. Bobby gun will reside at Hotel Inter Continental. And his men will take quarters at Central Bowling. Here is the plan for the residence. Annulator X-113 exists only as blueprints. We need to grab them. This invention could defuse all nuclear war machines in the world. Sterilize them accordingly to the agreeable phrasing of the Professor. In other words: "anyone" grabbing those plans could rule the world with impunity. Any deterrent power would be ineffective on "him". Do you understand? Von Krantz is now hiding the Annulator formula at his home. We know the place. A villa located in an isolated place in the suburbs. Beware... A little useful detail... The villa's entrance is always opened like the jaws of a trap. Secondly : His daughter, Sylvaine. She never leaves the house. Statisticaly and psychologicaly she's the old man's weak spot. She's the perfect hostage. I will just add that it would be funny, crazily funny, atrocely funny, for the world proletariat to receive such a christmas gift from the hands of that old switz reactionary. Some good news, boys? -It's done, Mr. Gun. -Bravo Do you have the pictures? Yes. If we keep going on we'll soon take them in front of Von Krantz. To tell you the truth it's the secret wish of the White House. Let's go. Villa Von Krantz. North front. Outside of Laboratory. Villa's main entrance. Professor's room. His assistant's room. Ground floor. Outside of drawing room. Over. -OK. You've done a fine job. I don't know if they will be useful but send them to microfilm at the Pentagon. A bunch of vampires, reptiles, scolopendrae. They call themselves scientists. Merchants. Merchants searching to pollute the well of life. I'm searching for a way to save the world. I find it. I break the claws of anguish. Do you think they would be relieved? No. They only want to reach military hegemony thanks to my invention. Ivan. Did you notice how I look like the Annulator formula? When the final equation was written I saw myself in it. They would like for me to abuse of my own image. It would be like a lizard vomiting his own skin. What are you observing now? Your hands. You have fairy's hands. The wicked fairy. I don't like mankind. Or I like it in a jar full of arsenic. Where are you going? What are you looking at? Miss Sylvaine. She's in the garden. She's taking a walk. Sylvaine. The beast! The beast! It's his time. Fear. It can be tamed. Funny, isn't it? It's the best way to attract attention! The top ranks will never understand. I need to be invisible and they give me a commando. What's the use of it? We don't want to attack Von Krants's house. Target 2. Fire! Look out! Look out! To the cars. Hey! And me! We'll pass by the top of the hill to avoid them. Hey! Wait for me! Camouflage is the first necessity in our trade. Who says camouflage says disguise. To take someone else's face. To be noticed is in any moron's possibility. To be invisible is the chameleon's art. An accomplished spy is at the same time psychologist, artist, funambulist, conjurer. He must exercise with assiduity, obstination, passion to maintain skilfulness. Our life is at this price. I will show you a few examples. No kidding. Of course. A mourning grave-digger. A tragic actress A duchess. A "lady". A "Yellow". A Black. A White. An important note : you shall always keep your accessories with you. Make yourself easy. They all hold in this briefcase. You just have to learn to arrange them. With method. Over. And now. Burn everything. Don't we keep copies? -No. Singles. On film. The film could spoil. We thought of that. Ultra secret and confidential report on Koralnikoff project : The Koralnikoff project is pure stupidity. Koralnikoff is a stupid mouse running straight in the mouse-trap. Do you like doors wide open with a bait behind? Not me. I deeply studied the Von Krantz question. I have 40.000 reports on the table. Masons, locksmiths, mechanics, electricians, opticians, electronicians, chemists. To sum it up briefly, a fly caught in a spider web has less to fear than a man venturing in Von Krantz's place. I won't risk the life of any comrade in this wheeling-reactionary's place. Not even one! My suggestion is very simple. I want the albino in flesh and blood. He's Von Krantz's assistant. A young man with white hair and black glasses. He's Von Krantz's confident. His favorite. He knows everything. I want this man. Only him and nothing more. Signed: Chostakovitch. See that! The handsome Manuel. Him again. Are you still in love with this play-boy? He've had enough time to forget you since a year. Unless you are unforgettable. He wrote to me. Only a christmas wish post-scriptum he sent to me. Nature's balance. Perfect looks matching perfect emptiness. Why do you say that, father? You liked him well then. I liked the holidays we had in Shandigor. It's not the same thing. What are we going to watch now? Roll 13. Shandigor's parks and houses. Have you already heard about Shandigor? You know me, master...outside physics and insects. Shandigor... A great poet...A mystic poet ..Creator of a stone world. What the...? Stop, stop it, I tell you! Out of my sight, gallicaenous! From now on I forbid you to touch to this roll under no circumstances! -I give you my word, I didn't know. -You're lying! Disappear! I don't want to see you anymore! It's all my fault, master. I should have marked better the holidays roll in which you asked me to hide the blueprints. -I was stupid. -Let's say careless. What if Miss Sylvaine has understood about the Annulator blueprints? I don't give her the permission to understand. After all, where is the risk? She never goes out. Leave me alone! Help! Did she talk? Are you sure the dose is strong enough? I'm afraid..Manuel.... Mechanical objects everywhere... wires...mikes...I've seen them. What did you see? The Anulator maybe? No I don't want to die! -No...the blueprints... -Here we are, go on. -The blueprints. I've seen them. -Where did you see them? Manuel...it's not my fault ...it's not my fault. Manuel...he's a friend? By night...by day...everywhere I'm afraid. Manuel...he's a friend? Shandigor...Shandigor... Shandigor? I didn't know...it's not my fault. -Have the plane ready. We're on the right track. Sign 1. I order you to go to Shandigor with her to follow that clue. Go on. Bad news, Chostakovitch. Von Krantz's daughter is in the hands of the baldies. And very far from here, at Shandigor. A word to the wise. If that story is true, very good! They think they're annoying me but I'm enchanted. You're worrying. Aren't you? Worried? For who? For what? The movie roll is well guarded. And you're taking care of me. Aren't you? For Sylvaine, of course. But she has no money and knows nobody. She'll be back. She would have been back already. I think she might have been... -She might have been...what? You forget that for us the world begins and ends here. She must come back. Miss Sylvaine has seen the blueprints. She has understood. Outside our world she's nothing. Where else could she possibly live? Of course. The handsome Manuel. Always the same casing? Always the 13rd. Other people's happiness. Ivan. You're forgetting. It's time. Yes. Master, there's someone in the villa. It must be Sylvaine. Go have a look. An armed man. He's in the corridor leading to the laboratory. We're going to pin that amoeba. Where are you going like that, Mr? Stop! Don't move. Drop your weapon. Now! Step up in front of you. More. More. Now turn on your left. Stop. Now step over the threshold of that door. Go on. Step inside. That's it! My pills, please. -What are we going to do with him? -The gas will take care of him You want to kill him? What about the body? We'll have to get rid of it. It will be transformed, decomposed, liquefied. And now show me the acids last color. At school when I was a kid I was afraid of skeletons. I was dreaming about them at night. -Such anguish. They were a symbol of death to me. -How brave of you then to accompany me here today. But I'm a big boy now! I was trying to picture those gigantic beasts browsing earth's ground. All were not vegetarian. Some were even devouring at each other with sharp teeths. What an uproar it must have been! Bob, why do I say such silly things? Why am I afraid to simply say I'm happy with you? Maybe because I can't find the words to say it. ...maybe I had to know that today it's real, without questioning you... ...and one day we don't believe anything anymore -Go home, I'll see you there. What's up? You don't believe what you've seen, do you? I can tell that you're back from death. Then what? Don't you know you're a stake in the game? Like everyone around Von Krantz. Nothing forces you to risk your life. You're a scientist. Don't you think it's time for you to step out of Von Krantz's shadow? The choice is yours. You just have to earn the right to our recognition. You know what I mean. I'm boarding at Inter Continental Hotel. Intern 007. Take this card. Learn it by heart and destroy it. Don't lose your time. Sooner or later someone will take hold of the blueprints. Better turn the situation to your advantage. Come with me Miss. It's best for us not to mingle in this kind of business. And now be careful. Take this cab and go home. See you soon. War is declared! They killed one of ours. Last week Igor disappeared. Today comrade Ginikof was stabbed. They want war? They will have war! I want immediate retaliation, total, brutal! Understood? At once. 500. At the Bowling. I want an omelette without eggs but much vinegar! You killed a man. I fought for Germany. After the war I fought for me. I carried on around the world. Alone. I was searching for you in my own way. I believe it, you know. I really do. Until I met you I still believed I had a mission to fulfil. Scores to settle. And since that moment I just kept going. Like a tired robot whose only wish is to stop. -Where is the truth? -What truth? -My trip here. -Don't think about that? Don't you think that I speak too much? You seldom say a word. -Where is it coming from? -What? -This silence of yours? I wished to speak to someone for such a long time. I could have died without seeing you again. I'm positive he could have done it. He was becoming completely mad. He had a terrible fit the day I discovered that he was hiding his formula in our holidays film. By coincidence it was on one of the roll we shoot in Shandigor. You remember? I broke his faith and he was terribly angry at me. I did not want to die before seeing you again. And here we are. -You have nothing to be afraid from now on. -I know. I get dizzy. -And now? -Now? No more now. Now is something else. Kiss me. Nobody. Nobody will be able to snatch our secret now. We have codified our lives. I have codified our lives. And the moment and the day I will decide that the code has been broken we will disappear. Thanks to this. Sylvaine, do you think you can refuse such a death? -You're late. -And yet I ran. Hello. -He's playing dead. -I wouldn't like to be in his shoes. -Me neither. It's a long way from Shandigor. -Enough now! Sign 1 doesn't like confort. Sign 1 will never wake up anymore. Poor Mr. Smile. Get ready for embalming. The ceremony will take place under the dome Bye bye Mr. Spy. Go and find Argus again, the one hundred eyes prince. Go to the land where silent guns keep quiet. Show your Intelligence with the enemy. From Satan's realm bring me the blueprints. When you'll go to the ball, the Evil's ball... ...clutch from Lucifer the mystery veils. Mr Spy, bye bye. To Inter Continental Hotel. But...Hotel was on the left! Where are you going that way? Are you listening to me? Stop, stop at once! Ivan! Ivan! Sylvaine! I have a shameful feeling. A noise? A cold brothel noise. People who will cover for me? But they can't cover for me. Yes, yes, yes. I've transformed into a vulture ...like them...with no image. Cold...cold. Someone's ringing? Someone to steal from me? The signal. You give me a signal? Does it work? My house is drowning. Come! Beast! Come! It will warm me up. It's as cold as me It must not die. See that! You look like me! Come, come, nearer. You can't come. Me I can. Manuel. I have to go back. I must be there for his burial. I can't let him leave alone. -Stay with me. -You're not accompanying me? -You knew it. -No I didn't know it. Come on, Manuel! Don't you understand that I need you? I'm nothing without you. I love you, I love you... I know that you lied to me. I saw you speaking to the bald man at the Luna Park. I believe you're just a coward. I'm leaving if you have nothing to say to me. -I love you. -That's all? -Sylvaine, it's too stupid. -Let me go, don't touch me. -Sylvaine, come on! -No, I don't want to see you no more. It's over. Sound and lights! Nice barbarian music! Quintessence of the decaying capitalism! Maybe a little too noisy? I'm going to faint. I'm ill. Stop. It's nothing. You're listening to yourself when you should speak and I should listen. Despicable albino! Stupid creature! He gives me much complication. -He swears he knows nothing. -I know that he knows! I only want the blueprints. It's not asking too much. I'm not asking for the moon. Von Krantz didn't show me the hidden place. He wants me to play Ivan the Terrible and I hate that role. Too bad. Let's play. Mr. Albino! Maybe you didn't notice the black grid at your feet. How unfortunate! And did you hear about the Siberian carbonic moss ? How unfortunate for you! If you did you would have spoken. I was forgetting. This moss is toxic. Consciously or unconsciously you will speak. Hurry up! Level is rising fast. I can still stop it. Taking pictures of the blueprints without copies and hiding them in a holiday movie. Delicious and efficient idea. I recognize Von Krantz. But deposing the roll in a postal box. Stupid idea! I don't recognize Von Krantz. Wishing to sell the roll to Gun! Very bad idea! Traitor's idea! Showing your degrading political views. Which of these keys open the postal box? That one, huh? You will go to the post office when it opens. What do we do with him? We finish him? Not necessary. Let him loose. Let someone else put a rope around his neck! A miracle! I have the roll with me. The Post office send it back to me with a warning card. I have no right to put such objects, foreign items, in my postal box. That's a miracle for sure. Take your car and come to my hotel. But I can't do that! My life is at stake! Chostakovitch's men can jump on me at any time. No. I'd rather hide here. There is a beach and public baths nearby. At this time and in this season there's noone. The place is safe. It's deserted and nothing is locked. Nobody would have the idea to look for me there. I will hide in a cabin. In cabin 101. I'm waiting for you but make it fast. You're my last chance to stay alive. It's noted. Cabin 101. I will be there in one hour sharp. Be careful. One hour? Why so long? What are you thinking of? He's an happy man. He's alive. He's afraid. Me too, I'll be afraid one day. Thanks to you. Get nearer. Closer to the Brain Monitor. I'm here. The first part of your mission is a success. You are still worthy enough to wear BLACK. SHINING.SUN. secret organization's ring, We now have all the data we need to be the first and only ones to possess the Annulator. However imminent the final victory, there's still danger at large for us. Watch the Brain Monitor. You're going to wear the Kamikaze outfit. That's where our scientists put the final touch to our secret cloth made from nitro-fiber and viscose polymozic coating. When any bullet reach the cloth it instantly disintegrates with the man wearing it. You know what it means. You come back alive with the roll or you blow up in front of the enemy if you're hit. No traces from Von Krantz discovery or from your passing through our world must be left behind. Now dress on with the Kamikaze outfit and leave. BLACK.SHINING.SUN. is watching you. Are you here? "To Herbert Von Krantz" His friend. From the gates of hell protect his soul my Lord and have mercy for your deceased servant, H. Von Krantz. Spare him the punishment his doings should bring him since his only wish was to please you. And since his true faith made him a pious man down here we hope that, when in heaven, your kindness will give him a place in the angels choir. Let him rest in peace. Amen.
