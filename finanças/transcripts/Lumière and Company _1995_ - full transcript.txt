It's cold in Romania. I can't believe it! Is this the box? It's unbelievable. This is a relic. I feeI like crossing myself. It's so beautifuI. It's only just a box. Not bad. WonderfuI. Fine. Impossible. It's too much in the corner. It's rustic, cleaned with your fingers. Arrival of a train in La Ciotat (France). When I was offered to take part in this little saga, I fancied the idea.

THE GAME 100 years after the Lumi?re brothers 40 directors shoot with the Cinematograph Why did you agree to use the Lumi?re camera? Well, I think when a director hears the word "limitation," he's thrilled because it's a challenge. I don't know. Out of curiosity. It's for the game and as some colleagues wanted to play... There was something both happy and melancholic about it. It didn't take me long to decide to do it, but again, not for serious reasons. Out of challenge. I like the city of Lyon, the people who have invented the basis of my work, I like the food in Lyon and I have a lot of friends there.

For fame! Why do you film? This is a very immodest question. Not the question, the answer. I film because... I want to be loved. Why do you film, Mr. Rivette?

Of course, like anything. Unfortunately. As long as imagination and memory exist, people will try and remember, and print this memory somewhere. Stories won't disappear. The need for listening and watching stories won't disappear. I have no speciaI mystic about it. I believe cinema is a means of expression, as others before. It's no more nor less mortaI than them. Maybe cinema is old, or getting old? I don't care. Sometimes, old people are more beautifuI than young ones. 5 years before the year 2000, hundreds of Spanish boys are imprisoned for refusing military service. A day in the life of a conscientious objector, the writer Felix Romero. Every morning, he comes out of prison and goes back in the evening. I wanted this film as a testimony.

Splitting sounds and music which link the shots, 2 or 5 seconds, is fabulous! That is the question: to tell a story with the means of cinema. I don't think about it, I keep it to myself. Can I see the Lumi?re camera, Dad? Dad, let me see their camera! Are you shooting? Hey, Dad! The crank's here. Wim Wenders, why do you film? Because there's nothing else. - Let's forget about this traveling. - Oh, no! But look, it's not possible. Can we already view something? He's not Deneuve, you can't ask him to be precise.

This way I can frame. Fine. Half a step forward. Okay, it's fine. Is there someone behind? You two, up! Quickly! 8 out of 8/36 Why do you film? I like seeing things or imagining things, and putting them in a frame. It's the framing of what I have in mind which I enjoy most in filming. It gives me an extraordinary pleasure, almost sensuaI. Because... just because. Filmmaking is a pleasure for me, but I don't take it very seriously. It's a playground for me, as when I was a child. I don't know and I don't want to know. Maybe it's just for the pleasure I get from it. It nearly reaches exultation when I am with the audience watching my films. I think it's some sort of obsession, obsession is when you've lost all rationality, when you can't express it so you go on filming to try and know why. So, I can't give any coherent answer. Never ask a centipede why it walks or it'll stumble. Are you ready? Go! Look at me! Look! Look at me, Sven! Why do you film? I think I film to survive. It's the most efficient way to survive. I know no other way to survive without filming. You've got to work for the backlight. Be carefuI, Lolo is married. She's got stiff principles! No, wait!

To start with, I don't believe in death and even less for cinema! Impossible! Eternity gives me the blues. Cinema is mortaI, it's all the best, for we have to enjoy now what's mortaI.

What about you? Go! It's impossible, impossible. Yes, it's too much in the corner. Now people tend to believe that cinema can describe all the events in the world, even the comic universe, as in science fiction. On the contrary, I believe that cinema can't shoot any image. This is what I'll try to show you. Can cinema describe the image of that instant 50 years ago? It is totally impossible. If we had been shooting then, me and the camera, we would have been destroyed by the atomic bomb. We mustn't be presumptuous. Cinema can't describe everything.

Do you want the center or don't you? Wait, I'll tell you. Why did you agree to shoot with the Lumi?re camera? The Lumi?re camera is a relic. Something like the Holy Shroud. Some have different religions, I have the religion of cinema. That's why I wanted to shoot with this camera. Cut! Perfect! Nothing to do except watching unpacking. Directors don't do anything, they watch the unpacking. I can't see a thing. Okay, I go! It's 1.33 isn't it? 1.31? Better still. Ready? Go! Why did you agree to shoot with the Lumi?re camera?
