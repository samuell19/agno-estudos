Mr. Wong king fai, we're stop! Don't move! You need to clam down first... Calm down Catch him! Get him!! Move! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! What are you doing! Stop! Where do you think you're going? We suspect you've been infected. You have the right to not cough. But any fluid you cough up can be used as evidence against you. What? The epidemic task force is investigating where the patients have been during the incubation period. Suspected cases will be issued a 14-days compulsory quarantine order onto other news... Uncle kau, dinner time! The Mrs. Said you need to be fully sterilised first Turn around Darling, I'm starting. I thought it's food? Mrs. Said you have to drink the soup first. It's so disgusting, I'm not eating this. Sure, you can do that but when Mrs. Comes back from Bangkok... We're from the epidemic task force, is Mr. Yam here? What is it? We suspect he has the virus. He's inside. What's going on? We're sent here by the epidemic task force centre we suspect you were in close contact with a carrier and need to take you to a quarantine centre for 14 days. How's that possible? I haven't left this house for more than 10 years! How could I be in close contact with any carrier? Did you receive a delivery recently? Yesterday, at the door. That was it! Come with us! I can't, I can't leave my wife told me I can't leave this house until! She comes back go! Go! No wonder the voice was so familiar, it's really you, tin. I miss you, it's been a long time. Isn't he the delivery man from yesterday? Who are they? Your fans, they worship you guy, Dee, say hi. Great. Tin, thanks for rescuing me. But if my wife finds out, it'd be bad. I've checked... she is still in Bangkok no flights flying in or out at all. We just have to say we aren't able to make any contact. As we've put you in a quarantine centre quarantine centre? It's a hotel and ladies have been arranged for you the plan is perfect. Allin all, it's logical, reasonable, legal, viable and family friendly. It's within all the guidelines for cheating, I'm sure you'll be happy with it. It's a meticulous plan, it even has a codename love in the time of corona. Love in the time of corona? No, it's make love in the time of corona. Make love is the whole point excellent codename. Make love in the time of corona. You were quite remarkeable luckily we were well prepared. Or else you'd be escaped it was better than a movie, right? I didn't have a stunt double. Honestly, it has nothing to do with me. Why don't you let us decide. Just tell us where you've been. What's the big deal? What do you want me to say? It's my privacy. That means you don't cooperate for the safety of the people, we can lock you up in quarantine for 14 days. I woke up at 7 that morning. Had a breakfast at home, then went back to the office. And? Went for lunch. Where? The grande hotel what is this? The skin is not crispy. No, it's more crispy than fried chicken. It's already our 10th tasting, and it's still like this? Babe, you realised it's the 10th tasting. I thought we're not having shark fin? How come it's here? At the last tasting, you said it wasn't decent enough, so we added the shark fin. There should be shark fin. Will you two stop irritating her? All I really want is a perfect banquet. I didn't want to let you two down. Nothing wrong with the tasting, as long as the in-law is happy. Looks like you will pay the bill today? You want to talk money with me? I'm an award winning actor. Do you know how many celebrity friends, I've already offended for having only 50 tables? We'll need another 10 tables, at least! I'm sorry, what award? Sai wan ho civic centre best amateur actor. I thought you're a fishmonger. Yeah, he does look like one. Old lady, can you stop taking aim at me? Old man, watch how you talk to a beautiful woman! You two should watch it. I'll hold you two accountable, if my celebrity friends don't get a seat. Keep talking crap, we won't be leaving until you pay. Then let's stay, blow me! I'm coming over! Come on! Another word, I'll beat the hell out of you! How? Let me think, I'll sit down and think about it. We're staying. Staying? I can't, I have to go and play mah-jong. Why didn't you say something earlier? Come on, let's go. I'll let you have it this one last time. Slow down, be careful. What're you doing? Leaving. Did she let you? If you don't listen to her, what you'd face will be worse, your life won't be easy. It's the hard rules, understand? Think about it. Where were you yesterday? Went to kowloon park... For swimming lesson. Swimming lesson at your age? No, I know how to swim. It was an advance class. You know, just to keep myself fit. You're quite a liar. That's alright, you wife has been waiting outside, should I get her in here? I went to sauna and spa. What's the big deal? Is it illegal? Did I kill someone? It's a healthy, hygienic activity. It's nothing, my wife knows about it. Were you in contact with anyone in the bath? I was on my own. But you know... I had a massage afterwards, I wouldn't just take a bath. So I had two masseuses. So you were in contact with two people? It was 'buy one, get one free' during this pandemic period so it was four. Where was the sauna? The grande hotel I'm calling you speed, because it fits you do you know why he's called speed? Because he runs away at speed when there's a fight! Do you know why he's called diesel? Ever seen how a diesel train moves? Moves like this... I'm stupid, I'm stupid... Stop laughing! Stop wasting time. We're in the same gang, bros before golds I'm glad you said that, bros before golds whatever you've got, I'll take them. You think you can sell them all? You think you can sell them all? As long as you have the goods, and give them to me, my people can sell them. I've imported loads of guns. Accurate, with a nice grip, of a great value. Let me have those too and I'll sell them as a package deal. If I make a profit I'll give you a 20 percent of share. Say thank you. Piss off... See! No fever. American made, brand new and waterproof. Arriving tomorrow. Good stuff. Pure alcohol, kill gems and virus. It smells good too, straight from Japan, also arriving tomorrow. That's great, since they're all arriving tomorrow, just let me have them. I've just got an idea. I'll have your goods, sell them as a package and give you 20 percent of share. Why're you copying me? Copying? I just thought of it! Then there's nothing more to say. Boss. Hey, are you stupid? That's pure alcohol. What if it catches fire? Mister, where were you at 7 this morning? I was watching lions in a park. You don't have mental problem, right? Then? Went to Hong Kong island for what? To release a shark. Where exactly? The grande hotel Kiddo, what're you doing here? Can I film you? Of course. I'm the manager of this hotel. I take good care of this place at all time. This is daddy. I'm Danny, not daddy. It's alright, bye-bye. I'll handle this. What's this? Don't come closer, stay there! I'm the head of pandemic task force it's fine, we just confirmed three suspected patients had been at the hotel. So we decide to lockdown the hotel for 14 days. That means we can't leave? Gosh, isn't that the date of our banquet? Wing, where are you? Where are you? Woa, chill out, boss! Where are you now? I'm here. Where? I see you. Really? I can't see you. I'm outside the window. Window? Hello but it's really fine, it's all under control. Disinfect the place! What are you doing? Back off stop, get back. Dad hey, hold on. We have to break out our shipment is arriving tomorrow, we can't be trapped in here. If we can escape and they can't, then we can take their shipment. Let's move out. Quarantine? Nah, I've got work to do! Don't try to get out. If you're caught, you'll be put into compulsory quarantine. So let's clam ourselves down, it's a hundred times worse there. It's better for all of you to stay here. Trust me, it's gonna be alright. All under control lockdown the hotel! Look what you've done, tin! Hold it, I've got a backup plan. Do you remember Rouge? Rouge from ritz club? Yes didn't she married and move to the us? Divorced, came back and works again. I've already booked her for 2 weeks she's waiting for you upstairs. Ah! Saving grace! Thank goodness! I better wash myself up. Take Rouge to my room later. No problem. Thank you. There must be other exits. The basement carpark should still be open. Call the driver. Everything will be fine. It's all good. We will get back to you... I'm Danny chan. If you need anything, just come to me. We've had our 10th tasting already... Everyone! A moment please! Please clam down! Our boss would like to say a few words. Boss. Honorable guests, I know everyone is worrying about what is gonna happen in the next 14 days? And you should. Because this virus is extremely evil and lethal. It might cause the apocalypse. But that's only for the outside world. Inside the hotel, none of you have to worry at all. It's extremely safe, because I, Tommy Lee is here. You might not know this, but to be honest, in Hong Kong, nobody knows more about hotel management, than I do. And nobody knows more about f & b, than I do. And most importantly, no one knows more about coronavirus, than I do. Why don't speak in Chinese? But I can promise you all, over the next 14 days, I'll stand with you, live and die by your side I'll guard this place until the very last second. I, Tommy Lee, promise you.. In 14 days, we'll meet again in this lobby. Every single one of you, leave no man behind! Allow me to quote from the captain of the Titanic if the Titanic should ever sink, I'll sink with it! Clap, everyone gives a round of applause. Victory! Victory! For the next 14 days, breakfast, lunch, dinner and supper is all on me. Free for everyone. Let's get a seat. That's great. Come on! Free meals all day! You crazy? Boss. Leave no man behind, get it? Get it. Really get it? Get it. Yes, leave no man behind. Is everything sorted? Yes. I'm having my wedding banquet here, how'll you sort it out? Yes, miss, clam down first. Tell him to stay. No problem, calm down. My banquet is scheduled on the 14th day of the quarantine. How'll you deal with this? Is the rooftop ready? Yes, can leave anytime. If I stuck here with them for a fortnight, I'll be as good as dead yeah, brother. I told you, stop calling me brother, call me boss. - Yes, boss. - Boss. Boss. Rest assure, everything is sorted. Discretion is the essence check this out, this is the rooftop with no one in sight. Where's the chopper? Our helicopter because of air traffic control, it couldn't come. - Then what? - Don't worry. I'm here. He's a graduate from the 65th royal air force academy. Nicknamed the flying dragon, Mr. Robin... Cut it. Boss, this is the academy's latest ground to air jacket. With it, you can continuously fly 500 km. It even has a GPS but it's so flashy, people will spot me escaping! But it's made in the us. What does that have to do with this? I'd be seen. Can I wear yours? You like this? I happen to like the colour green boss, I'll swap with you. Doesn't he know our plan? I told him, he just didn't get it. Alright. Boss, just lightly pull on this, and you can leave. Can you demonstrate for me? - Of course. - Cheers wait, don't... It's fine... Watch me. Didn't you say he's the flying dragon, that's it? You arranged this? You arranged this? - Maybe. - Take care of this. Take care of this. Boss, come on. Alright. Boss! Protect the boss! It's locked? It's my boss' car! Sit tight Chill out, it'll be a smooth ride. Hey, I'm not on yet! Shit, dead end. What is he doing? This is nothing. 8000 revs At 2 km per second. I'm so great at driving! Boss - come on... Who is he? Slide handbrake! Gas, down gear, burn tires, slide again! Gas again, down gear again! Drift... Once you're in my car, you'll make it. Boss, it's alright, I've got a weapon. Boss, let's go. I'm not drunk from one drink open another bottle Open another bottle I'm more drunk from seeing you with my squeezed eyes. You're a friend, let's open another bottle where's the boss? I don't know, just go! How do I know if you're lying? Of course not, just remember me, Danny chan you can find me at the front desk. Danny who? Danny chan Mrs. Tsui, just leave it to me. - Bye, Mrs. Tsui. - Rest assure, I'm on it. How can I help you? What? Unbelievable... Don't you recognise me? You fired me this morning, said I took too long to make the rooms excuse me, I only recognise guests and staffs make 30k a month, or more great answer, I'll remember to use it later. So, what do you want? Accounting department said I can't get paid, unless you sign this right away. What? No staffs coming in for next shift, and our staffs can't work 24 hours a day one more staff is better than one more guest what? What're you saying? I said I'm not working for less than 30k. Why would I want to pay you that? Then you'll remember me, my name's mango. You think we can't afford that? Then thank you, and I'll need a super deluxe suite. You're here to work, what suite? I'm a guest. Good girl. Get it sorted, now! Thank you. What's up, kiddo? My mom said your smile is so fake. Hahahaha is this the room we'll have for our wedding night? 14 days of quarantine, meaning 14 free nights at this hotel, that's brilliant! I'm so excited, let's make out, babe. Brilliant? Really? We don't even know if we can still have the banquet anymore! Then just let it be. What did you say? I'm just saying we only have the banquet to keep our parents happy I did say we should elope while on holiday. But, it's a once-in-a-life-time for my babe to be the leading lady, of course she'll need a perfect banquet. And after the perfect banquet, there comes the perfect wedding night... Why don't... What's wrong? I feel dizzy. Again? Have some water. The doctor said you have prenuptial panic disorder, try not to stress yourself out, relax. Are you the manager? What's the star rating of your hotel? Five stars. As if! The apple is not crunchy, the towels are not warm, the water is not French, and the magazine selection is poor. When I switch on the TV, there's just one screen, I can't choose other channels. What hotel is this? We'll open up all the channels, all on us. All the channels? What channels? Porn. Porn? What're you doing? - What the hell are you doing? - Why're you here? You took off my clothes? You took advantage of me? You disgust me! You two are awake. Hello, I'm milky you were together when we found you, so milky guessed you two are together. I've changed your clothes to be clean, and have you two sharing a room. Milky, right? You're so naughty. Where did you hide my pants? I didn't. Just kidding. Milky, I'm not with him. Please get me another room, so I can be with you. All the other rooms had been occupied by suspected carriers, they're off limit. Not even one? I'm sorry, the hotel is full. I'll let you two rest. Milky, wait. Only one person can stay here. For the first time, we're on the same page. Please. You want a fight? You think I'm scared? Come on... Wait! Gang rules said, 'punches are for enemies'. Yeah? Then let's do it. Alright, agree. Open up, swap rooms. What is it? Nothing, just want to see what view you've got. Oh, it's the sea view. Come in. Are you barbequing? We'll talk when you come in. It's alright, thank you! Do you have a new light bulb? Let me ask for you. Well, we're acquaintances after all, you sleep first. You're welcome, you sleep first. Come on, I won't attack you while you're asleep. Me neither, go on then. You sleep first. I'm not tired. Really? I'm used to staying up late. Really, me too, the later the better. Then great, let's stay up. Madam, phone call, it's sir. Hey? What're you doing? I miss you honey. Why is it so dark? Where are you? Yeah, I've got put into the quarantine camp. They said I might have the virus. It's so harsh here. I can't do anything, not even allowed to be on the phone. That's why I'm calling you from under the bed. What, you can't even talk on the phone? What's your room like? Show me. I'm scared they'd find me filming. They're very ruthless. A man was dragged away. Hey! Who's talking on the phone? No, they've found me! Pull him out! Help me, honey. Help! What're you two doing? Hubby! And off, perfect. You two evil masterminds... so promising. What can she do with you now? She can't even reach you. Do we take Rouge to uncle kau now? So impatient, come on. Two, three. - Wait, don't! - Um? You didn't just... - What? - The blue pills, you took them? Just swallowed them. Where's Rouge? Here. Rouge? Uncle Kai... I'm so grateful for all these years, no matter where I go, you will always call me up. So when tin said you're out, I really wanted to see you. But, we're not young anymore, we're both in the high risk group, so it's better for me to stay in. If possible, you should too. Damn it, I have the worst luck of all! The ladies was right there at the door. And the one who's supposed to be here, left me alone here. Come on! What is it? Not calling for you. What should I do, look, the pills are working! Don't get angry, we'll find a way. - Yeah. - What way? As long as we have our phones, it'll work, leave it to us. Alright, but give me a little time, ineedice. It's so itchy. We have prepared these clean laundry, feel free to take them. Come take a look. Thank you. See you next time. Thank you waiter, get me some food, some oysters. I'm sorry, sir, please queue up. I need to queue? That's what people do at buffets. You want my people to beat you up? Sir, I urge you to queue up now, as that is the last tray of oysters. Where're the plates? Boss, we're all worry about you. How's the hotel? Are you out of your mind? Have I ever needed you guys to be worried about? You know perfectly clear, you've got no one with your right now. A gangster without his gangs, is trash, completely useless... Enough! Did your mum ever teach you about manners? Don't be this blunt. Bye! Better recruit some underlings. Interested in joining the triad? Will you protect me? Of course, I'm doing a flash sale, just give me some money in a red pocket. But I don't have cash. Do you use payme? Play me? You want to mess with me? You think I don't know English? You're so outdated. Triad is a sunset industry. You want to pick a fight? Don't get all worked up, you just want some money. It's true, right? Be realistic and buy London gold with me. Buy gold? Hey... How? ID number. Finger print. Done. I'm going to recruit some underlings, and will need to have an induction ceremony. Will need some usual ceremonial stuffs. Bring me alive chicken! The hotel has grilled, salted, boiled and soy sauce chicken. There's even roasted Turkey during Christmas. But no live chicken. Do you have a lord guan statue? Can I borrow it? What? Lord guan statue? The one with a beard, wears a gown, a stern looking man. Alright. Yes, yes, him? Lord guan? Yes, he's very stern. Alright, thank you. Do you know you're useless? I guess you already know that. That's why father left everything to me, and nothing to you. He's right, you know? Father is right. But it's alright, I have a plan b. How could I trust your plan again? Hurry up. Same father, he's the boss, but you're the security guard. That's just bleak. I just need to hold on a little longer. Soon he'll die in an 'accident', this hotel will be mine. Boss, hereitis. I didn't know the hotel has such a place. This is the top of the aquarium. We exit from here. Boss. Ah, right. He's top class! He was a key member of the Navy seal, and, he'll lead us out. Yes, wear the diving suit, and with this underwater GPS, we'll get beyond the aquarium, arrive at the septic tank a kilometer away. Septic tank? Whose idea is that? It's mine, boss, sorry. Yours? Genius, no one could have guessed we'd escape through the septic tank. Well done, come on. Allow me. Sit, boss. Look, I've already swapped the bags. Inside is 10 kilos of led once I buckle this to his waist, he'll hit the bottom in 3 seconds. Plus, I filled his oxygen tank with carbon dioxide. He'll surely die of asphyxia. Good job. Give me that. Sure. Thank you. - Boss, be careful. - Give me a push... 123 you're hurting me! Hello. What to do when there's a problem? Solve it ourselves. Then get going, get back to work! Got it. Hello, William and Judy. Hi manager. What's wrong? Nothing, just want to talk about our banquet. Are you two happy with the honeymoon suite? We'd be more happy if you can refund our deposit. The virus came out of nowhere, and we have a lot of work to do. We wouldn't be able to do that for the time being. How about this. I promise you, as soon as my boss say yes, I'll get back to you. That does make sense. I'll leave you two to talk it over, I've got to go. I'll let you get back to work. All the best. You couldn't even handle something this simple. Are you a man? Stand right there! Yes. Refund. William, didn't we just agree on... Don't call me William. Call me Mr. Wong, refund now. Mr. Wong, I just explained. I don't want your explanation, I want the refund. You think I don't know you were just playing along? You're smiling again. You know how hideous you look. I hate your smile. I command you, to refund our deposit right now! Yes, right now. Immediately! Man enough for you? It's alright. You want me to show you? William... Mr. Wong! Judy stomped off. I shouldn't watch this. But she is just like me, sacrificing for the arts. I should admire her performance. And exchange of acting techniques. Hello, I'm michiko. Her facial expression is stiff. How are you? Lines unclear. What's wrong? A lack of body language. I will punish you! You are too lazy! What app is this, can we trust it? We searched a bunch of dating apps, finally found one beautiful woman in here. So many social networking apps, your generation is so good with tech. We've already asked her to meet at the restaurant. How much should I pay? It's an equal society, everyone gets what they want, no money invloved. But there're rules. It's free and it works, I'll follow all the rules. It's alright, I remember them. Are you pinky? Never thought someone as pretty as you would use these apps. But would you like someone who's as mature as I am? No problem. Let's get to it. I have two rules. I know. One, if we ever see each other again, we have to act like strangers. Two... I also know. Now that we've met, we can't quit, and you can't give me a bad review, or else, I'll be blacklisted. Since you now know the rules now, why don't we take it upstairs. Perfect. Didn't you say upstairs? Why're you still sitting here? I've stood up, it's you who's still sitting down. I think there's been a mistake. It's not me who's on this date. It's him. Fine by me. Not me. Your daughter is asleep on my bed, take her away. Ok. Coming. Hold my phone for me. Why are you in my room? Can I talk after I zip up? Left or right? Meaning? What are you talking about? You want my daughter... Sh.. Told me to move my daughter, you want me to put her to the left or right? Or on the floor? That works too. I meant take her back to your room. This is my room. What? Alan said, a guest had a bathroom problem so I had to let him have mine. And? And this became my room. If you don't like it, I can. Alright... Alan, what's wrong with you? How can you let mango sleep in my room? There're no other rooms. It still doesn't have to be my room, right? She has to stay with you. You know the hotel is full. I have to share a room with milky. Fine, I'll deal with it. No room, right? Tomorrow... I'll think of something tomorrow. What? You've been sunbathing for so long, it must hurt. Here's a bottle of aloe Vera. Nah, men don't need this. I do. Thank you, kiddo. OMG... What're you doing? I want some. Can I? Gang rules said, you must help a brother in trouble, if not then you'll be destroyed. You don't have to bring up the rules all the time. Turn around, I'll help you. Thank you. Wait, you think I'm stupid? I'm not turning my back on you. You turn around. Wait, you think I'm stupid? I'm not turning my back on you. Then what? What? How do we do this? Hey! Stop moving. You think I'm scared? Geez... Your technique's not bad. I go to the western palm for massages. Really? Me too. Whose your massuer? me too. There's discount after 10. I normally go after 11. Do you eat their noodles before the massage? They're not bad. Do you add the egg? Of course not bad. Do you like them using elbowing? I like walking massage better. Lower I want higher. No problem. With this ppe, we can do whatever we want? We are the pandemic task force, here for bodychecks. Wow you're exempted. Sorry. Yes.done. What's your problem? Why does it take you forever to make a room? If you're so great at it, why don't you show me. So? So clean yet so fast. I think I can go 30 seconds faster in the next room. There's no next room, you've done them all, thank you, manager. Wow what is it? We're the pandemic task force, to give you a body check. What kind of test? Rope skipping. Hello? Why are you just standing there? What's taking you so long in the shower? I'm nearly done! I've got to go, the queen is summoning me. You're useless, like a beggar, a fool, crap. What's taking you so long in the shower? I'm nearly done. I've got to go, the queen is summoning me. Remember to wet your hair. I have to do a deep throat sampling. Open your mouth, and I'll put it in. It's really dark in here. Close your eyes and you'll know how dark it is. It's alright, we've got a sleeping buddy service. Ms tsui I'm happy to be of service. Can you do it? Of course. I dreamt of becoming an action actor. I'll die if I can't smoke. And this is a non-smoking room. You really can't smoke here. I've thought it through, when we finish the quarantine, we'll have the banquet at another hotel. But we will cut it down to 30 tables. But you have 29, doesn't that mean I'll just have 1? We're the pandemic task force, here to do a bodycheck. The air conditioner is too cold, the freezer has no ice and the shower dribbles. And that corner, it used to have two switches, how come there's only one? I've checked everywhere, through this vip area, we can escape from the hotel. But maybe the task force is in there. It's alright, we have an elite from the army. With him leading the way, it'll be easy. Boss, I've dealt with everyone inside, please. Please. - Go inside. - You take another look. Open the door. What? Wait, who are you people? I'm the boss of the hotel, Tommy Lee. I'm with the pandemic task force, even the boss can't leave. I'm not leaving. I saw a staff escaping, I was trying to catch him. Was it you who broke my window? I was working, I'm sorry, it wasn't on purpose. Sorry? Do you know how much does that piece of glass cost? It was venetian blown glass, 410k a piece. How much are you making? How could anyone blow such a large piece of glass, liar. What do you know, how much do you earn? Per month? You can report a complaint. How much do you earn? I'm asking you a question. Go and report me. I'm asking you. How much do you earn? We've got an complaint department, you're welcome to report me. Answer me first. - You go and... - Sir... - Where's the suspect? - That way. Report me. Close the door. A rise of 38 cases today. As epidemic prevention equipments are coming short in supply, there's a hike of price. But people are still queuing up for the equipments. Under the panic buying, most shelves are emptied in supermarkets. Police got a report this morning, that 60 packs of toilet rolls were stolen... With the situation deteriorating, we'll have to shut down all leisure facilities, including the swimming pool and gym room. As for catering arrangment, it'll be on ration system. Apart from meal times, we hope everyone can stay inside their rooms. We'll also schedule some outdoor time. Of course, remember the 1.5 metres social distancing. Please stay 1.5 metres apart. Please stay 1.5 metres apart. Instead of buffets, everyone will be served individually with a portion of food, to minimalise the risk of cross-contamination. Lastly, I hope we can all work to fight this virsu together. These Japanese masks are selling at 1300 dollars, at least! These disinfectant sprays can easily make a profit of 100k. Kiddo, what're you doing? Filming you two. - Give me your tablet. - No. - Give me! - No - give me that! - No. - Don't be so mean. - Mommy, save me mommy help me, save me. Save me mommy help me, save me. Save me baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo baby shark mommy shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo mommy shark you stole our inventory? Stay back, we have a hostage. Calm down. I'll burn all the mask! We are taking these with us! We'll burn together. Just talk to us. If you guys have the protective gears and we don't, then we'd all be dirty. She's got a point. If only we have them but they don't... We might still get infected. Ceci, come to me. Hey yes? Bye-bye bye-bye. Remember to wear a mask. I know, good night. You always end up in a girl's hand. But she's so cute. Bravo, you scared that guy away. I've already given you 3 chances, and you failed all of them. Give me one last chance. This ventilation duct is connected to a tunnel built in the 2nd world war. Why did we mess around so long with all those escapes? Because this route is the toughest one, poor ventilation, harsh and dangerous. It can't be more dangerous than staying here for 14 days. Use your brain. Come on. Boss, are you alright? Be careful, I'll wait for you. Hey, pup! Not so fast! We can't keep up. It's all your fault. If you went with that girl, she wouldn't smear us online. That's not what I want. Don't argue now. Tin, I know you're in the hotel. OMG! Get down! I saw the post online. Saying you are there with kau... Trying to get yourselves a date but, I'm not blaming you. No one knows what will happen with the pandemic getting serious. Life is short, have fun while you still can. But you still have to take care of yourself. When you get out of shower, remember to apply the... Athlete's foot cream, haemorrhoids cream, nail solution. Then take the gout and kidney pills. Remember to take them every day. With your prostate just getting better... Stop, just stop. I got a couple of ideas. Pretend a robbery or a fire. Not bad, but count me out. Didn't your wife just give you a hall pass? You guys go and have fun. Let's go. Such a heart-felt conversation with your wife, it wouldn't be right if we don't make it count. No, I miss her. You can miss her and have fun at the same time. We're here anyway, we should have fun, then go home and treat her right. I really don't want to go. I don't want to do my wife wrong anymore. You're not the only one with a wife? Why did you rescue me? It's you who said you've got no appetite when looking at her, that's why I rescued you. No appetite is still better than you. You kept complaining how much you hate your wife. And you? You said your wife without clothes on is like a shar pei. You said when you see your wife in the shower, her skins are nearly touching the floor. We're great friends, but do you know what our biggest difference is? You like playing games with women, I don't. You're my friend! How can you say that? - Asshole. - At least I talk like a person, unlike you - I've been loyal to you. - Who rescued me, - would do anything for you. - Who rescued me, - you're just a bastard. - Then put me in this jail. - Ungrateful - just like the jail at home. - Son of a bitch. - I'd be punished when I get home. - You mother fucker. - You too - what did you say? - Shut up! Don't you think I didn't hear you swearing. I hate people swearing. Uncle kau. What the fuck you want? Can you speak slower? I couldn't hear a word you said. With such a hellish situation out there, I wonder anything would happen within this hotel? Of course there'd problems stucking here with you everyday. What? What did you say? Yes, I was saying, even though it's getting intense outside, as long as we stay here, we'll be fine. Then what about our banquet? Babe, don't worn yourself out, we're doing fine. Wear a mask. Hey, 1.5 metre distance. Ok now? Why're you wearing a mask? You just told me to... Why're you so far away? Didn't you just say? You just do whatever I said? Don't you like me, don't you want to see me? You... you're really... Never mind, not going to say it. No, go on. I'm fair, say it. Go on. - You want me to say it. - Go on. - You... - Shut up! I know what you want to say. You want to say, why have I become so fickle? Why am I insisting on a perfect banquet? But you won't understand even if I tell you. Why? Because you've done nothing. You didn't even propose. What have you invested in the last few years? It has been me, who kept giving. I'm so exhausted and it's killing me. All because you're a terrible boyfriend! I've had enough of this, bitch! What made me the worst is wanting to marry you. I've done nothing? It's not I don't want to, but I was going to do them later. I haven't given anything? All these years, I've given you... my dignity. You think I want to call you babe? You're just a big baby! Wong dai ho, leave! This room belongs to both of us, why don't you leave. Don't ever come in again, we're getting a divorce! We're not married yet. Isn't there rice with steamed chicken? Just the heads and necks. Soon, it'll just be the butts. Try it first. It's delicious. Updates on the pandemic... 15 mores... - Local cases today. - What's this? Most of them are within... - Families and friends... - What's wrong? Therefore, - nothing, - we should be more careful... - I feel hot one moment but cold the next. Watch out if you have any symptoms. I feel that too. A lot of confirmed cases have symptoms, such as diarrhoea, - with mushy poop. - Great, I don't have that. Also, they'd have fever with cold flashes, sore throat, coughs. So everyone should wear masks or cover the mouth and nose... It's alright, I just choked on the water. But the most overlooked symptom, is the lose of sense of taste. Some people could taste nothing. And if you have all those symptoms... Wow, this salted egg is really salty. It's 99% positive that... - You've contracted the virus. - Wow, so spicy. The virus will attack the lungs, kidneys, blood vessels and even cause encephalitis. Lead to organ failure, might cause sudden death. Cheer up and call our hotline as soon as possible. Cheer up and call our hotline as soon as possible. - 2900-0766 - hello, temperature check before the meal - no need. - I repeat, 2900-0766 - the food doesn't look appetising, I'm alright. - 100 hotlines waiting... - Wait. Hey... Keep calm. I'm not drunk from one drink open another bottle Open another bottle I'm more drunk from seeing you with my squeezed eyes. You're a friend, let's open another bottle I'm so scared... Are we infected? The news mentioned 6 symptons, we only had five. It's just a coincidence. Stop being paranoid. Thank you. Did you know that salted egg I had, wasn't salty at all. When I tried the chilli sauce, it wasn't spicy either. I normally can't eat anything spicy. - Hello. - Hey, can you... This is the pandemic task force hotline, we're very very very busy. We'll put you on hold and our staff will be with you shortly... I miss my doggy. If I die, who'd take care of her? What would she do? You've been here for a week, if anything, she'd be dead already. Momo, it's all my fault. The biggest regret of my life is never watched a match at old trafford. Why not? I thought I still have time. I really want to see the world. Shopping in Europe. If we survive this, I'll go with you. Great bro. What's the last symptom that hasn't occurred yet? Diarrhoea. Shit. Wait. Uncle kau? Aren't you uncle kau? You really are uncle kau! Do I know you? Every man my age knows of you. You're an example to all men. I'm making a mojito, you want to try? Mojito? Perfect. Thank you. I was going to have my wedding banquet here. But with the hotel on lockdown, that's not happening. And being stucked in a room with my fiancée 24/7, we finally had a big fight, so I need some air. I really did want to marry her, but lately, somehow, it just feel like, we're just butting heads. I mean, when she's here, she's always the one in charge what I wear, what we eat. Everything is her decision. She keeps saying I don't do anything while she already does everything, what else can I do? When I'm with her, I lose myself. Stop... Everything you said are positive. Seriously? Actually, what's better than having someone arranges everything for you? You might feel suffocating but it's a blessing. Sometimes the best things are right in front of us humans are like this. We get so easily used to what we have, and take it for granted. Maybe, from time to time, we need to remind ourselves, to open our hearts and feel that love is always right by our side. So melodramatic. You're right. I've been giving nothing, thought I can always do that later. But I got that now, something can't wait. I only have this bouquet of masks, and now, I, wong dai ho is down on my knees, marry me, chu lai ying! My parents already got the dowry, how can I say no? I have my own faults too. I'll listen to you more. You ladies are really something. Sometimes there's social distancing, sometimes there's zero distancing. Anyhow, I'll stick with you for the rest of my life. The fever is gone, so we aren't infected. But how come we're still going? I think I know. Remember that tray of oysters, we'd been eating for days? No wonder I found them rancid when I ate them yesterday. Yet, you still ate them? I was hungry. Nope, it's coming, budge! Thank god, I have a small ass. What's happening? Why're you looking at my daughter's tablet? You're invading her privacy. She's kid, and it's not password protected, which means no secret. You want to have a look? Here. Hand it over, I've never seen it. This is my daddy. I'm Danny, not daddy. Play the next one. Kiddo, you have the wrong person. I'm not your daddy. Should I take you to your mum? You don't know what she's doing, right? It seems, she's choosing the best clip for her homework, the homework is my perfect father, funny right? I don't know who she'll choose? Look, I'm quite handsome from this angle. I know, I as a person... is quite... Confinue. An asshole. And me? You... you're... I dare you. An asshole loves playing tricks on other assholes. You're full of it. Come on. Here, brother, give me your hand. Come and help. That side... Slowly, boss. It's alright... You alright? Now we did it. Brother, somehow, I'm feeling a bit guilty. Father used to say you're hopeless but I disagree. Really? You being a security guard is correct. Let me tell you, being brothers... Bro. What was that? A pangolin? That one? Could it be a masked palm civet? What now? Oh hell! Alright, wait for me, let me go down first. Why don't we sit together? Sit with him? Not unless he apologises first. Uncle kau. What? Tin wants me to tell you he's sorry. You tell him, I'll be the bigger person. Uncle kau said he thought about it. He knows you always have his best interest at heart, like when his father passed away. That was his mother. Right, when his mother passed away, he was grateful that you were there. I didn't really do anything. I only helped out at the funeral. When my father passed away, I was thankful that he was a pallbearer. He said he's grateful you carried his father's coffin. His father even appeared in his dream, told him to treat you right because you're his guardian. Uncle kau said he saw his father in his dream last night, and said you two will be bros for life. In his dream? Really? And you two shall buy a lottery and win the jackpot together! Really? Yeah, give me some numbers. What're his favourite numbers? 2, 7 and 17. 6, 34 and 44. Bonus number must be 9. Represents! You two are full of wicked ideas. Hello, let me take a photo for you. Closer. Arm around shoulder! Ah, I'll do it... Because he can't reach my shoulder anyway! Smile. Babe. What's wrong? Where did all the hair come from? Why're you so young and handsome? I had nothing to do, so I practiced sword fighting in my room. Why do you need me here? Dad, tea. My dear, you're getting marry today, you're a real adult now. I've never really given you anything. I'm giving you a big fat red pocket, once we leave the hotel. As for you, I'm giving my daughter to you, if I hear she's unhappy, I'll kill you. I promise you, I'll love her forever. Where are my bros? Mr. and Mrs. Wong, where are you going? We've been looking for you. We're going to the meet up point. Everyone needs to do that except for you two. This way please. Where are you taking me? What is it? Is everyone ready? The bride is coming. Kiddo is the flower girl. This way, this way. Are you disappointed not everyone is here? This is enough. It's alright, look what we've prepared for you. Look this way. Congratulations on getting a good son-in-law. Yes, our son is a great man. We're lucky to have a good daughter-in-law, too. Congratulations, knowing you for so long, you're in for a ride. Congratulations! It'll be my treat next time. Thank you, kiddo. Kiss her... Alright. In just few minutes, everyone will be free to walk out that door. But to be honest, for all the guests I've served, you must be the largest lot that wants to walk out on me. I've arranged this wedding, hopping everyone will remember our times in here. We started out as complete strangers, but now we've lived under the same roof together, have helped each others at one point. We gather here to witness this union, and give out our blessings, so we can reflect and be a better person than we were. Alright, so the time has come. Let's countdown from 5. Hey, help here. Boss, here... We're finally back and it's the 14th day. Tell you know who, to gather the guests at the lobby. Alright, right to it. Boss, let me tidy you up. Congratulations. Congratulations on completing the quarantine. But the pandemic is not over yet so please continue to fight. Congratulations. Hubby, do you feel it's somehow different now that we're out? The biggest different is your surname changed from chu to wong. Mrs wong the sky seems clearer, the wind breezier, and the air is fresher. Really? Haven't breathed in such clean air for a long time. It's great. Michiko? Thank you, thank you. What're you saying? You... you turned me into a new man. - Can we take a photo together, selfie... - No... Come on, I'll be quick. Tin - yes? Where do we buy the lottery? Let me. If we win, then let's go to Macau, 3 days and 2 nights. Macau, 3 days and 2 nights? Wouldn't that be interesting? Darling. It's our lovey-dovey couple retreat. You're counting me in? Won't happen without you. Good boy. I miss you, darling. Wear the mask properly, let me give you a full check-up. Hey, baby? Yes. It's me, just got out of the hotel. What time is your flight tonight? Let me get changed and pick you up at the airport. Now, there's one less enemy, and one more friend, boss... boss... What do you want! What, what're you looking at? What do you want? What are you looking at? Stop it. Let's go. Hey! Old trafford. I know. And shopping. Where's old trafford? Can we get there by bus? Such a clown, you should see more of the world. Yes. Oh, you're wearing the mask wrong. Right, better be safe. - Congratulations. - Chef. Everyone's been tested negative, well done. Thank you. Danny the quarantine is over, are you happy? I love it. Why? It was like a neighbourhood. We're all neighbours. What is there you don't get? Was that some sort of joke you taught her? You're still missing a photo for the homework, right? I need a family photo. Us, family photo? Take your mask off. Smile. A genuine smile daddy. More genuine. Alright. Come on! You, come here. Boss. Where are the guests? I'm sorry boss, I couldn't make them stay. Do you think you should kill yourself? No, because I need to take care of this hotel. I'm sorry. Can't you even take a joke? Any reporters? Yes, they're outside. The one with the suitcase, move. Mr. Lee is here. Can you tell us how you fee! After the quarantine? I want to thank everyone. The success to the quarantine, was mostly down to our honorable guests and our excellent hotel managemet. It's a rare thing. But more importantly, was I, Tommy Lee, was here. To be honest, nobody knows hotel management better than I do, right? And nobody in Hong Kong... Knows about... I... I think it's time to... Take them! Hurry up! Grab them aboardd for quarantine. Wow, the earth really does become cleaner. I hope it stays this way always.
