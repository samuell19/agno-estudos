Ugh, spiders… they’re all over the place, what a plague! Her hands are fragrant with the heat of summer Her breasts are fragrant with the heat of summer When I feel the cold I go to her And she gives me the fire of summer Dreaming on the shore, hot and steamy nights We’re closed …those Augustów nights Good morning.

You’re a new woman, you look really beautiful. - So I looked ugly before, did I? - No, no, you look beautiful. But that means I looked old and ugly before, right? Is that what you mean to say? No, I’m just saying you look beautiful. Honestly. You’re trying to tell me I’m old and tired and ugly, are you? But… God, no…nothing of the kind. You look great, ready for a party, exquisite. Honestly, ready for a ball! I tell you, it’s highly convenient. Six months of peace and quiet. You don’t have to do a thing, not even comb it, nothing. You don’t think she made it too light? It’s... really pretty. Really pretty. Not too short at the back? I tell you, it’s charming, very charming. Augustów nights… Get it yourself, all right? Thank you very much. … on the shore… Just leave it on the counter. My hands are all oily from the fish. Oh, it’s lucky you reminded me, I must buy some oil too. Then please get it yourself.

Shut up, you little brat, right this minute! You bloody little bastard! Shut the fuck up, or I’ll give you a real hiding. Put a sock in it, right now! Quiet! Come on, wake up. Oh Christ we’re about to get off. Come along, wake up. Come on, child, wakey wakey. Oh Christ, he’s dropped off again. I was all alone, Alone it happened to me Just last night Someone just like you Kissed me, just like you I don’t know who it was Because there wasn’t any light And when the sun came up, I was all alone, alone And when the sun came up, I was all alone, alone It happened to me Just last night Someone just like you Had long hair just like you Although you’ve been, yes, Since yesterday in the ground, So go now, go, I want to be here alone. So go now, go. I want to be here alone. Mariusz dear, what are you doing now? Are you drawing something new? Yes. Hm, yes. You must be very busy. Yes. Yes. So what are you drawing? A film, nothing special. A film, nothing special… Tell me about it, I so rarely see you. Tell me a bit about it, I’m all alone here, lonely as an owl. Once I’ve drawn it, I’ll show you. But you can tell your mother about it. Oh, mum, I don’t know what to say. I’m not good at describing my films. Don’t get upset, son. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I spoke to Tadzio Nalepa and he’ll be doing the music. Really? He plays so beautifully So you’re still friends? And do you sometimes go and see him there? To his forest by the river? Yes, yes. Does he have dogs? Yes, yes. What are their names? Gibson and Bimber. Gibson and Bimber? Gibson, Gi… What a strong man he must be. He’s so brave about his illness. I heard him say …he’s simply grown to like it. Yes. I think it was on TV. Or maybe the Ra… radio… I can’t remember. Yes. Oh God, what’s wrong with my memory? He’s going to sing and play. He’s going to sing and play for your film, right? Play. Play. You look very tired. Do take care of yourself, dear, …be sure to eat …at least one hot meal a day. Hmm. …and don’t smoke on an empty stomach. Oh, Mum, I know, I know, I know. I’ll come in a couple of days, then we’ll have a chat. Lots of love, bye. Bye bye. Bye bye, son. Look after yourself, please, get enough sleep. Someone knocks at night, And wakes me from my sleep, I don’t know what he wants from me. What he wants. Perhaps he wants a glass of water, Perhaps he wants a slice of bread, Perhaps he needs a place to shelter You’ll deal with the flies, won’t you? We can’t have them flying around like this, for God’s sake. Oh dear, them flies! Them flies are all over the place, the bloody things. To hell with them. We’ll never be rid of them. They’re everywhere. Today I was eating a brawn and aspic roll, I just put it down, over here, for a moment, …and they were all over it. They’re a right plague, they are. That’s a... house fly. Musca domestica. Calliphora vicina. A stable fly. Stomoxys calcitrans. What’s that? You’re interested in flies? Those filthy creatures? And that’s a hover fly. Oh Christ, what’s this one? I’ve never seen one like that in all my life. You’re really interested in these filthy things? It appealed to me once, when I was younger. Everyone has a hobby. Well, yes, little boys have all sorts of strange ideas. Who did you want to be when you grow up? - Do you remember? - An airman. Really? Yes. And was it your secret, or did everyone know you wanted to be an airman? Yes... No... I don’t know. An airman is an airman. To me, pilot is a pilot. No joking. In the air you’ve got to... Shit, how fiddly this is… Did you have a secret when you were little? I won’t say. When I was a little girl I used to draw two dots on my finger, a vertical line just below them, and a smile under that – eyes, a nose and a mouth. That was my friend. Inseparable, my one and only, till death us do part. I used to tell her my secrets, nobody else knew them. And no one knew about her. Every time a plane flew past I’d run to the meadow, wave my hand and shout: Mr Pilot, Mr Pilot, your plane’s got a hole in it! I believed the pilot could see me and hear me, and was even smiling. And that one day he’d land for a while or at least lower a ladder. I wanted to fly to my daddy. That plane flew over every day. And straight after Granny would call me in for tea. There was always a slice of bread and butter waiting on the kitchen table, and strawberries sprinkled with sugar. You know what, I used to go and see my granny too. On holiday. To Granny Lodzia. And Grandpa Longin. There was a river there, a small garden, a bee hive. But from the tree you could see the smoking chimneys. Granny often served cucumber for tea. With honey. She used to say it was watermelon. All day I climbed trees and crawled in the bushes, I was always dirty as a little imp. Once I was in bed after supper, Granny would tell me to poke my feet out from under the quilt to see if they were clean. She only checked one, so I only washed one. But little girls are well-behaved and don’t get dirty, do they? Of course. A few days before Christmas Granny died. In the church, beside the crib with the baby Jesus there stood Granny’s coffin. With a green fly wandering about on her mouth. It made me think of the last days of summer. How did a fly get there in winter? The man who bought Granny’s house didn’t like the noise of the passing planes. Then he set up a car repair shop there. Now I’ve heard there’s a petrol station there. Hm… well, such is the fate of the airman – one kiss and he’s gone. Farewell, Barbara. Mirek… You still keep the seashell Found beside the lake... We’re out of the frozen ones. A few live ones, perhaps? Round it up to a kilo? Ah, I’ve got two nice smaller ones here. Leave it at that, or shall I take out the fatter one? What? Cut the heads off? Want them gutted? If you like, I can cut off the heads and gut them. Well? But what are you…? Madam, we’re all in a hurry for the holiday So make up your mind, either – or, chop-chop. Cut off the heads or not? What are you doing? Do you want them with the innards, or shall I get rid of them? Someone might want them for the dog. Please decide quickly. There’s a queue of people waiting. Have you seen my little dog? Pimpuś, Pimpuś, Pimpek! Don’t say a word, I beg you. Don’t say: one day I’ll return. Bye bye, Mummy. We’re off. Quick march. Bye. The train has blown its whistle, but It’s not bringing you home Julia... These spiders are everywhere. What a plague! Shut up, you little brat, this instant! Fuck you, you little bastard! Shut up or I’ll give you such a hiding. It happened to me Just last night Someone knocked at my door Someone just like you. I don’t know who it was because There wasn’t any light And when the sun came up I was all alone, alone And when the sun, when the sun came up, I was all alone, alone, I was all alone. It happened to me Just last night. Someone just like you, Had black hair, just like you. Although you’ve been, yes, Long since in the ground, So go now go, I want to be, I want to be alone. So go now, so go now, go. The Berlioz express from Moscow to Yalta via Griboyedov, Kislovodsk and Sevastopol will arrive at Platform Two, Track Three. It is due to depart at… Oh dear, I’m so sorry. I slipped. I do beg your pardon, sir. Here. What are you… What’s this? Maestro thanks you, citizen. Sorry? Thank you, citizen. What are you talking about? What’s this money? Please take it back. You were short of it in the shop. You were short of it this morning. In the shop. Short of it? Six zlotys and sixty groshy. But who the devil are you? I am part of that power which wills forever evil, yet does forever good. What are you talking about? I am the spirit, …ever, that denies! And rightly so: Since everything created, …in turn deserves to be annihilated: Better if nothing came to be. So all that you call Sin, …in short, you see, Destruction What you’ve meant by Evil …is my true element. N-RU-ter, n–RU-ter, n–RU-ter, YA-wa-NUr, YA-wa-NUr, YA-wa–NUr… When I’m alone And a bird starts singing Is that beauty?... N - RU -ter… N - RU -ter? What was the head trying to say? What was the head trying… Wait a minute. YA - wa - NUr, YA - wa - NUr… YA - wa - NUr… Could it be saying “Your number”? … and why would it want my number? Who’d want to call me, what the hell for? Who’d want to talk to me at all? About what? When on your hair Am I of any use to anyone? The night casts shadows Is that beauty? I’m old. Or is it beauty When I kiss your hair? May I? Sorry? May I ask you? I don’t understand. May I ask you to dance? Me? Yes, you. B-but… no, N-no, I … I can’t, I can’t… Please, please say yes. Look, The night is falling A cloak of darkness Is flowing from the sky. It’s hiding your house And the path where I’m waiting. So don’t make me wait out here for you in the chill of the night. Look, Now the night has fallen, shielding the window panes. Wrap up your face in its darkness No one’ll know you in a veil of darkness So open the door And don’t make me wait for you in the chill of the night. Christ is born this evening, Let us go rejoicing, Though the night is gloomy, Day will soon be dawning. Angels from on high are singing To the one who comes from Heaven Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, in excelsis deo. Look, he’s about to nod off. His little eyes are closing. Little Mariusz, Daddy’s going to show you a fairy tale. Are you pleased? Let’s ask very nicely. Please Mr Magician, may we have a lovely fairy tale for our darling little Mariusz? Light It’s off. “FOCUS” Read it! It’s a fairy tale called: “How Fiki Miki Mouse Sailed Across the Seas and Oceans from America”. Something here’s not… What’s this? Why isn’t it...? Something’s… Why won’t it move on? Maybe try the other way? Why’s it stuck, dammit…! Shhh! One day you’ll wonder where he got those words from. Why can’t we do anything properly in this country? Polish shit. It says “Ma-de in GDR”. What? It’s from the GDR, it’s German. You can’t trust anyone. Here, let me have a try. I wanted to get him a construction kit and not… have him watch fairy tales. What’s wrong with a little boy watching fairy tales? You want to make a little girl of him. What do you mean? When he grows up to be a faggot, you’ll have what you want. Wash your mouth out with soap! Can you help me? Please help me. Yes of course. Where shall I put it? Here, here. On the rack. Thank you. ...fast train to Poznań and Skarżysko-Kamienna, continuing as the slow train to Świnoujście, is departing from Platform One, Track Two. Please step away from the platform edge. Mothers, don’t let your child play with matches. Ladies and gentlemen, the driver and his crew welcome you on board this train and wish you a pleasant journey. Excuse me, which medal is that? Sorry? What did you get that medal for? May I take a look at it? Melancholy? Sorry? You’re so young and already so sad. I can’t hear you. What did you say? Where do you get your cheerful nature? Not so loud, not so loud. I’m sorry. My wife has just nodded off. I’m sorry. It’ll do her good to have a short nap. What did you ask? Where do you get your cheerful nature? About this medal? Where do you get your cheerful nature? Cheerful nature... My favourite season’s an Indian summer, you know, yes. I like an Indian summer. What about you? Do you like the Indian summer? Yes, I do. I take the dog for walks then. Two soldiers lured my dog over, out of the blue, all of a sudden. They just appeared in the gateway. I couldn’t understand what they were saying, I hid out of sight, it was a bitch. Zorka, yes. They petted her, threw her sticks, They tied her to a tree, First they shot her in one paw, Each smoked a cigarette, Then another paw, Then they ate some ham sandwiches taken from their pockets, tossed her some scraps of ham. Then they shot her in the third paw, and laughed at the way she turned funny circles. They couldn’t be bothered to finish her off. When they’d gone I lay there till evening, holding her tight, Until she bled to death, yes. 63 days. We had to escape through the sewers. Sewer, that’s a big word, sewer. Just an ordinary sewage pipe, a rusty pipe underground. Less than a meter wide. No oxygen, feeling our way in the dark. On all fours. Excrement floating in urine everywhere, vomit, stink. My foot caught on something, I tried to pull it free, but it was stuck. When I finally broke loose, it was covered in rotting flesh, I don’t know No, I can’t imagine by what miracle I managed to crawl all the way to the city centre. I don’t understand why I was one to survive. Man – on the one hand it sounds so noble But on the other, it’s made of such flimsy material. Such flimsy material. Do you want to buy this medal? Sorry? You’d like to buy this medal, wouldn’t you? This medal. But you can’t buy something like that. Well what the devil, do you want to buy it or not? You’re buying it. But you can’t sell your… Damn and blast it, we’ve gone and woken her up. I did ask you not to talk so loud. What’s that, dear? Those were the finest years of all. The war? You see, Mariusz dear, we were both young. How do you know my name? I don’t, I don’t, it just slipped out. You see, sir, we were young then. I simply don’t believe in death. He doesn’t believe in death. Who? Him, the old man who passed down the corridor just now. But I didn’t see anyone. Never mind. Goodness, what a lovely little doggie! Just like our Zorka. Remember? Zorka, Zorka, Zoreczka. What are you up to? Calling a dog? She’s scared of Granny and Grandpa. She’s not scared of us, just him. He probably trod on her. Are you talking to me? Those young people in the corridor are behaving like hooligans. Hippies or something, with guitars. Probably on drugs. Hello! Excuse me. Would you please go away? Move along please. Who are you talking to? There’s someone talking in your voice in the corridor, hear it? But there’s no one there. It’s deserted. Not a living soul. Good God, is that Mariusz? Hello. Hello, Tadzio. I’ve been longing to see you. We could have sooner, but somehow I hadn’t the courage. But anyway. What’s it like there? Do you remember the last time we saw each other? I remember very well, in hospital, just before I died… I was extremely frightened. If it weren’t for you I’d be someone else. A completely different person. I miss you. I simply don’t believe in death. Everyone who has gone, has gone. They haven’t died, they’re still alive in my imagination. Including my parents. To this day I can see them young, smiling, happy, thinking about tomorrow. It’s incredible. And you’ll finally let me say something about you, now I’m so close to you. And forgive me, because I never tell you this sort of thing. I can always count on you. When I’m in need Overcome by by pain and anxiety When something frightens me. You make no demands. You ask nothing of me. And I, in turn, demand and ask nothing of you. Because I know that this selflessness makes for the purest of friendships. You’re always there for me. Zoreczka! What are you, calling a dog? Zorka! Zorka, Zorka! Calm down, our Zorka died sixty years ago. Sixty years without leaving the house. For sixty years we haven’t been among people. Give me a break. What about the barber, the tailor, the barber, the tailor? You’ve never even had to wash up after yourself. You live like a pig in clover. All your life in comfort. You’ve never had to do a thing. You didn’t even want to give birth to that child of ours. I can’t tell when you’re joking and when you’re being serious. Don’t you feel too hot? Why not take off that hat? You’ll catch cold again. I’ll have to make you chicken broth and nurse you. Oh dear, I love you. For God’s sake, what did you say? I love you. It’s as hot as hell and you’re waltzing about in that thick hat. Think you’re trendy, eh? All dressed up for the funeral, eh? Take off that hat and shut the window. The Porpoise local train is delayed by twenty minutes.

My husband promised he’d call as soon as they got there, but he hasn’t called, you see. I don’t know what could have happened.
