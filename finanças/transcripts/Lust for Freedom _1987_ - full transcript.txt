GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): The story that I have to tell is about freedom. But it became a nightmare because of what we had to go through to win it. It was a nightmare, because I took my freedom for granted until suddenly one day it was gone. This is a story about the terror and torture that I and others endured passively, like scared rabbits, until we finally gained our lust for freedom. My name is Gillian Kaites. It used to be Undercover Detective Gillian Kaites. I was one of the best on the force. Three mayor's citations for dangerous undercover work. But I made one mistake-- I fell in love with my partner. Ron Peterson had-- believe it or not-- become my fiance. He had been working side by side infiltrating a small arms smuggling connection. Finally, months of work were coming to a climax. I found out that a huge shipment had just arrived, so Ron was pretending to be an arms buyer with ties to certain terrorist groups. And I was posing as a lowlife go-between. Those drinking bums in the parking lot were really our undercover backup. Parker, who always came through in a pinch, and Saunders, a very green rookie. Ron was going to meet with the head man of the whole operation, a guy named Jonathan Trauma, or JT for short. I had worked hard and long getting him to trust me. I hated JT. Hi, Sunny. JT, good to see you. Hi. This is, uh, Ron, the guy I was telling you about. So what? I just hope we can do business together. My end of the deal is in place. You mind if we search you? No, go ahead. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Ron and I had been partners for two years. We were going to get married in three days. We'd put the wedding off four times, but we both agreed that after this big job, we deserved some time together. Everything was going according to plan. Two more minutes and it would all be over. But I didn't count on that rookie Saunders jumping the gun. Stop! Police! Hold it right there! [grunting] Don't get in middle of this. I'm getting a promotion for this. [phone rings] Oh, shit. That must be my old lady. Just-- just cool it. I'll get rid of her. Hello? Yeah, Whitey. What's up? Yeah, uh-huh. What? When? Motherfucker! Freeze! [gunshots] [off-hook tone] Ron? Ron! [screams] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Thanks to that dumb rookie, my fiance was dead. But at least JT didn't get away. There he is! Get him! What about this guy? Go check on Ron and Gillian. I'll take care of this bastard. [gunshots] [off-hook tone] Ron? (CRYING) No! GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Hell was breaking loose all around me, but I didn't hear it. I'll get you! Forgot your key, butthead? [screaming] [glass shattering] [thud] There's enough here to blow up ten cities. Ron! Gillian! Get in here! I found it. Hey! What do you think you're doing? You scum! Pull a gun on me? I'll show you. Bye, scumbag. [door creaks] PARKER: Ron! Gillian! Get in here. I need cover! GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): I should have answered him, but I couldn't. GOON: You finks are all alike! You're all stupid assholes! [maniacal laughter] Well, then I've got a surprise for you, scum. See you in Hell! GOON: Huh? Holy-- [explosion, screaming] [MUSIC GRIM REAPER, "LUST FOR FREEDOM"] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Cops were dying all over the place, and all I could do was act like a woman. I knew my days as a cop were over. I had to get away. I had no idea where I was going, and I didn't care. There was nothing for me in this city anymore. Without Ron, my life was meaningless. [phone ringing] GILLIAN (ON PHONE): Hello? Hello, Gillian? This is Captain Franklin. No, she's not here. When do you expect her? GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): I drove away. I drove aimlessly for days. I drove until it got to the point where all the roads looked alike, and it didn't matter which direction I went in. I don't really know why I stopped by the lake. Maybe I was just drawn by its beauty. I hadn't been in a place like this for years. It was soothing. Everything was so quiet. I almost felt peaceful, and peace was exactly what I needed now. Peace, and the time to think things through. Little did I know what was happening just a few hundred feet away. [MUSIC GRIM REAPER, "ROCK YOU TO HELL"] When I got back to the car, I could sense that something was wrong. But that was only the beginning. Oh, God, please! Please! Please stop! Please stop the car! Stop the car! Please! I'm stuck! Please! Please. You've got to help me. I escaped from the work farm last night. My God! I was up at the house. I know what you must be thinking, but I'm no criminal! I was just passing through like you, and like the others. It's been a nightmare! We gotta get past the line. They won't go beyond the county line. Wait a minute. What is going on? They'll kill me if they catch me. Can't you drive faster? [car horn honking] Keep going. The black van! Don't you understand? They'll kill you! [car horn honking] Whatever you do, don't stop! Keep going! [sirens approaching] What are you doing? Don't stop! Don't! [screaming] Good afternoon, ma'am. You letting her go? No, we're not really. There's hardly anything between here and 30 miles in any direction. I suppose the girl told you she escaped from the work farm? Wearing an evening dress? That is kind of silly, isn't it? Well, I guess the little girl just thought she'd be better off-- in something pretty, that is. [engine revving] Is anything going to happen to her? No, no. These things happen every once in a while. Nothing to be alarmed about. Look, uh, may I have a look-see at your driver's license, please? Would you remove it from your wallet, please? You're a long ways from home, Miss Kaites. Hardly anyone comes out here anymore, what with the freeway passing us by a long shot. OK, it's in order. I know you're probably in a hurry to get back, but I was wondering if you could follow me to the office. Why? Well, we have to take a statement regarding this incident. Now, it's only a mile down the road. It won't take very long. All right. OK, good. Oh. I'll get you back on the road in two shakes of a lamb's tail, how's that? [MUSIC GRIM REAPER, "ROCK YOU TO HELL"] [gunshot, screaming] Open your eyes, bitch. I want you to see this coming. [gunshot] [chuckles] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): The last person I wanted to be around now was a cop, but I knew where he was coming from. He needed my statement, and I knew too well how difficult it is when witnesses don't cooperate. Besides, I really had nothing better to do anyway. Turned out I was in a place called Georgia County. I didn't know exactly where it was, but it sure wasn't in Georgia. The best I could figure, it was somewhere near the border of California and Mexico. [dog barking] Well, Miss Kaites, this is our women's correctional facility. Now my office is over this way. Go ahead. Take your hands off me, you rat eater! I'm gonna teach you to fight. Mind your Ps and Qs. Sheriff called. Vicky's been a naughty girl. I'm taking her to detention room for corrective training. She be staying with us? No! She staying with us? Why don't you just get a move on, Ms. Pusker? Go on. VICKY: Let go of me! You know, I'm afraid Ms. Pusker's a little-- if you know what I mean. But until we can find someone to replace her, I guess she'll be head matron of this facility. I'll tell you what. Walk this way, please. All right. Where were you headed? Away. No place in particular. Got a family expecting you? No. Pretty girl like you must have lot of friends, then? No, not really. You know, I really admire a person like you, independent as yourself. Ah, here's your drink, Miss Kaites. You really must be thirsty. And I'll go look for that form. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Sheriff Coale was OK. The place seemed normal enough. But something inside me caught my police experience, or just women's intuition, told me things weren't right. You seem like such a nice girl. Want me to be so easy? Now. When you escaped, where were you headed? I was going home, where I belong. Don't lie. You were headed east on Highway 58 when you were captured. There's nothing on that road for 200 miles. I was gonna hitch a ride, that's all. Don't lie to me, bitch! Now you gonna tell me where you were going. You were going to have your boyfriend pick you up down the highway. Weren't you? What can I say to convince you? Just the truth, bitch. That's all. Now, who helped you escape? I planned this alone. Look. We've already captured the other girl who escaped with you. You tell us who else is involved, your punishment will be lighter. Nobody else was involved. Did Sharon help you? No. Check her for contraband. [scream] Is there something wrong, Miss Kaites? [moan] [thud] [humming] More dead meat. Can you, uh, file her belongings in the county police? Just a lot a worthless junk in a purse. Typical women stuff. Oh yes, uh, let's charge Miss Kaites with illegal possession of drugs, all right? Well, what kind? Well, check in the safe and see what we got on stock, all right? (LAUGHING) Oh. In the meantime, I'll take her over to the house and get some work done on her. And will you please get the paperwork done on Miss Kaites and get her car ready for transport to Mexico? Can you do that? -Yeah. I don't see much of you around here anymore, Karen. I've been busy, Ms. Pusker. Too busy to see old friends? Well, I've got my duty. (LAUGHING) Yes. The shitters. Where you conveniently put this. Honest. I found it, Ms. Pusker. Honest, my ass. Now I want to know who's bringing it in, how much, and where you're hiding it. I don't know. I found it. [gun cocks] --[laughter] You didn't find it in no toilet. You're probably a little goob trying to muscle in on my action. Now I want to know who's bringing it in. It's not true. There's no one. [moaning, humming] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): I was in a room somewhere. I couldn't get myself to wake up. I was so tired. All I knew was that I was terrified. Was I dreaming some kind of nightmare? [chuckles] [woman sobbing] You know, Karen, everything that Big Eddie touches seems to grow and turn green. Everything you touch seems to turn to shit! Don't you agree? I'm not hearing you, Karen. Yes, Ms. Pusker. There's something deceptive about a rose. And looks so beautiful and smells so sweet. Appears so soft and safe. And yet. [yelp] Now, who brought it in? My boyfriend. And you distribute how much? Not much. Very little. From now on, you bring it to me. All of it. You tell your boyfriend to keep it coming, and that you're mine while you're in here. Mine! Do I make myself perfectly clear? All mine! [phone ringing] Where's Miss Kaites's car? Garage. Being fitted for shipment to Mexico. Get the paperwork finished? Almost. All right. Afterwards I would like you to prepare a file on this case, would you? I'm bogged down in paperwork! Why are we always pushing papers? Because this is a business. And because we have to have information for our record. You know, like profits and losses, that sort of thing? Blowing away that little girl's brains-- was that profit or loss? You'll have to ask Maxwell that question. That's his department. You know something, Scruggs? SCRUGGS: What? Sometimes your worry me. Why's that? Well, sometimes I think you've got a conscience. Is that good or bad? GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): When I came to, I was sopping wet and nauseous. I could tell a lot of time had gone by, and I was in some kind of prison cell. Why was I here and what had happened? What was going on? Obey me. You're under my care now. Do you understand? Don't understand? You will. Hey! Somebody in there? Who's there? It's me, Vicky. What are you in for? Ain't much of a talker, are you? Ain't nobody stopped me once I got started. Once my grandma tried to. Beat the shit out of her. Not even Ms. Pusker. She'll get hers. Hey! What's up in there? What's going on? Gloria? Are you in there already with Randy making out? Ms. Pusker catches you, she'll make you do it in front of her. That bitch, Ms. Pusker. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): I was going to demand some answers from the sheriff, but I didn't get the chance. Move it! GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): I guess I was still too dazed to fight back. Fixed you up for a date. Bet you'll like him. Mind your manners. You may go, Ms. Pusker. Come in, Miss Kaites. Sit down, please. My name is Maxwell, and I'm the warden at this here facility. May I make a phone call? No, I'm afraid that won't be possible at this time, Miss Kaites. You've already had three long-distance calls. I think that's plenty for now. I never made a call, let alone a long-distance one! Well, I beg to differ. You just don't remember making them calls. This is getting us nowhere. As I understand it, Miss Kaites, judging from this report, you've been higher than a kite ever since you came here. That's a lie! I beg to differ. A search of your vehicle uncovered a wide range of illegal drugs in your possession. Why are you feeding me this load of bullshit? Now, wild talk like that ain't going to get you nowhere, Miss Kaites. The judge, he decided already to go light on you, thinking maybe you're just a little misguided. And in light of that fact, he gave you an indeterminate sentence, which means that you'll be out of here in no time if you just behave yourself. I could be here forever! Well, now, forever's a long time. I want to see an attorney. I have constitutional rights! And we have bent over backwards to comply with your demands. But frankly, Miss Kaites, I don't give a damn about your constitutional rights, as you see it to make a mockery of our judicial system. Ms. Pusker! Now, if you just behave yourself, Miss Kaites, life can be very easy for you around here. Is there a possibility that I could see the judge? You're looking at him. I told you she was no good. Let's go. Gillian? GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): All I could do was stare at him. Sheriff Coale, will you tell one of your deputies to release Vicky from the cooler? Yeah, sure. Let's go. Take a shower, put these on, and put your street clothes over here. Move it! Mm-mmm. [wolf whistle] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): I was in shock. I just couldn't get my brain to work. From now on, you're placed into the general population. Do as you're told, and there'll be no trouble. Don't personally do this to you lovely, stupid [inaudible]. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Ms. Pusker was straight out of some low-budget prison movie. But this wasn't a movie. This was real. Stop. This one's yours. Starting tomorrow you get work detail. Make your bed. I'll be back later to check on it. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): The bed was already made, but I wasn't in a state of mind to argue with this sadistic maniac, so I started to make the bed again. [voice on pa system] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Little did I know what was about to happen. Get away from my bed! You're dead! Dead meat! Out of the way. Get off! [inmates clamoring] Think you're pretty cute with that karate shit, don't you? SHERIFF COALE: Excuse me, please. All right, excuse me. What the hell is going on here? What is this, Ms. Pusker? Just a little misunderstanding. Nothing I can't handle. Fucking shit was taking my bed. Nobody takes my bed. When I come back, I always come back. I'm sorry. I didn't know. I wasn't told. All right, girls. The show's over. Everybody out, ladies. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): They had screwed up my mind so that I couldn't think. Thanks to my police training, they hadn't screwed up my body. Yet. You're slipping. I didn't know she used that stuff. I'll get her next time. There won't be a next time. Not like that. What do you mean? Heard of a game called Kick the Can? Yeah. Played it when I was a kid. So what? You're gonna play it again, only this time it's gonna be my version. My game's called Kick the Bag. You're gonna enjoy it. Is there anything I can do to help? No, Holly, everything's under control. Nosy, aren't you? No, Ms. Pusker. That can be dangerous. You're hurting me! Do you understand? Yes, ma'am. Please let me go. VICKY: Gillian! Who's there? Me, slut. I got a score to settle with you. Look, I don't have any beef with you. It's over. You've got your bed back. You put me down. You embarrassed me in there. Nobody does that to me. [screaming] Now! Get her! The slut's turned on. [moaning, grunting] SCRUGGS: What's going on in there? VICKY: Scum bucket! What the hell happened here, Scruggs? She was bagged and kicked around. Well, did you recognize any of them? No, sir. It was too dark. Another misunderstanding, Pusker? I suppose you know nothing about this. Not a thing. Should I investigate, sir? What? No one knows anything about this. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): I hated Sheriff Coale for getting me into this, but there was something about him that seemed different from the rest of these animals. If I could just get through to him. When I got out of the infirmary, I lay in a cell, recovering. For five years I had been a cop putting criminals behind bars, and now I was behind bars myself. Caged alongside the same petty trash and scum that I had helped put away. I knew a lot of brutality and perversion was going on in those cells, but I didn't care. I had my own problems. JACKIE: Watch my kids grow up. Get old with my husband. LYNN: Hey, that sounds really nice. Wishful thinking, huh? No. You can have all that. We'll get out of here. Don't worry. Yeah. You know, this may sound crazy to you, and I've never even talked about it with anyone here. What about? Well, we've been real close these last few months. I can't get you out of my mind. Every time I dream, I see your face. I'm lonely, Lynn. I never had a woman touch me like that. Make love to me, Lynn. Please? All right. That'll be your lousy hundred bucks, there! Please stop. I'm doing the best I can. Nobody's buying. Or maybe you just don't try hard enough. I can't force the girls to buy! Big Eddie's watching every move I make! Maybe I'll take out the rest of this week's money in trade. What do you mean? Take off your clothes. That's what I mean. No! What did you say? I didn't hear you. Nothing. I didn't say nothing. That's more like it. [cackling] [moaning] [music playing] [heavy breathing] [laughing] What are you going to do with me? I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget. Gonna wish you never escaped. Ha! Please help. Let me go! Let me go. Nobody escapes from here. Nobody! [whipping, screaming, laughing] You wanna see my John Henry? I'll show you my John Henry. [MUSIC GRIM REAPER, "ROCK YOU TO HELL"] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): And why should I care about the screams of these women? It's true that in one sense they were my sisters, but they were hardened criminals, weren't they? Besides, there were still screams of my own that I couldn't forget. [sobbing] MAXWELL: Doc, it's mighty good of you to come. I sure hope it's worth it in all this heat. Oh, I'm sure you'll be pleased. We will see. Take a deep breath. Open wide. What are you in for? I don't really know. They said I had drugs in my car. Same here. I think most of the girls aren't supposed to be here. What do you mean? Well, I think there's something funny going on. I mean, look around. None of these girls seem to be hardened criminals. They're not prostitutes or robbers. They're nice girls. But I don't know. I'm afraid. I'm scheduled to be released next week. What are you afraid of? Some of the girls, they only stay a short time. There are never any visitors here. No phone calls. I mean, doesn't that seem strange to you? Yeah. Pyorrhea. P-I-A-- Cody, if you're going to work for me, you're going to have to learn how to spell. Oh, I will, Doc. I will. I promise. I give her five. Next. CODY: Bring in the next prisoner. That ain't necessary, Doc. I got a good heart. It's required. Here, then. Let me help you. Breathe in. Breathe out. Didn't I tell you, Doc? Ain't nothing wrong with my heart. Let me be the judge of that. Aw, Doc, that was a good cigarette. Open your mouth. Say ahh. Ahh. Don't you believe in brushing your teeth? Only when I'm going to kiss a good-looking male, and there ain't none of those around here. Hmm. Hmm. I ain't no piece of meat to be picked at! No need for that, Cody. Just trying to protect my employer here, Sheriff. Now, calm down, Vicky. I ain't gonna let that son of a bitch touch me. You apologize to the Doc, Vicky! I ain't going to apologize to that flesh peddler. Get her out of here! Let me go! DOCTOR: Help me up. VICKY: Let me go! Let me go. Young people today. No wonder we lost the war. But Doc, you haven't seen all the girls yet! I've been knocked down and insulted. I'm hot and dirty. I'm calling it a day. But Doc, you haven't seen Holly, and I was saving her especially for you. Doctor Bass, this is Holly. Well, how old are you, child? 17. 17. Imagine that. Where you from, child? From Houston, Texas. All the way from Texas. Any family there? No, I was an orphan. Good. I mean, I'm sorry. We're gonna have to do something about that. But a quick examination's in order. Take a big gulp of air and suck it in. That's right, honey. All the way. Suck it in all the way. That's right, all the way in. That's it. Suck it in all the way. Doc, Doc, come out of it. Come out of it. [exhales] Sorry, Doctor. I must have her, Cody. The marvellous ones. You know what to do. Open, dear. Open wide. Say ahh. Ahh. [clears throat] Doc, what's wrong? Why you leaving? The contest is over, Maxwell. But what about Holly? She didn't make it. You must be crazy. Look at her. She's young and wholesome and she's a beauty. She may be in your eyes, but in my client's eyes-- you know, I'm dealing with a different clientele now. They notice things like bad bite, crooked teeth, ratty hair, rough complexion. But you could fix all that. Sure, but it takes money. The state don't pay me to fix teeth. And I can't make them girls brush. I'm sorry. She's very nice in spite of these defects. How much would you give for her as is? Well, considering she needs a lot of work, I would have to invest about, uh-- How much? 3,000. 3,000? Why, she's worth at least five! Doc Bass don't pay no top dollar for damaged goods. Bad bite, crooked teeth, frayed hair, malnutrition. Very good, Cody boy. Very good. Pay the man. That's, uh, 3,000 in cash. Doc Bass don't carry no cash. Not in Georgia County. Like, you never know who you might run into out here. I'm gonna take you away from all this, child. I'm gonna take you to my home, where we will put good food in your stomach, and good clothes on your back. Pervert. Well, you got 3,000. That's good enough, isn't it? Oh, she's worth twice that much, and that bastard will sell her for that, too. Well, maybe he just wants her for himself. Dirty old man. Look, Coale, we got to get rid of Vicky. She has become a burden, and we ain't in business to carry no deficits. Yeah. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Luckily, I didn't get to see Doc Bass that day. When I got back to my cell, I found I had a roommate. Are you all right? Yeah. My name's Gillian. What's yours? Sharon. Why am I here? Why can't I leave? Why have I been here so long? What were you charged With Possession of illegal drugs or something. It's a frame. I never saw that stuff before in my life! I just want to go home. I know my parents are worried. They'll never find me here. Where are they? Hollister, California. They have a farm on the outskirts of town. You know, Mom and Dad are pretty old. And they had trouble relating to me, but they never wailed on me or anything. I just wish I could go home. I'd never run away again. We'll see what we can do about that. You'd better rest. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Even though I had ceased to care about myself, Sharon was so innocent and helpless that something within me began to stir. When I look back on it now, I realize that it was meeting Sharon that sparked the first embers of resistance in me. Meanwhile, the goings on at the prison were getting worse. First, Maxwell got even with Vicky for screwing things up with Doc Bass. I said I'd look into it. In the meantime, I got a girl I got to get rid of. I've arranged a little wrestling match tonight. How does that sound? Good. Who is it? Vicky. Break her in half. Show her who's the boss. That stupid bitch. I'd reckon I've raised some feathers on her back today. Well, she can take out her frustrations on the wrestling match tonight. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): And because Doc Bass was getting greedy, Maxwell had an idea to eliminate the middleman. Using the prisoners as talent, he started to make his own porno movies. Of course, Maxwell's idea of a porno movie was sicker than anything anybody could imagine. Please, no more. Henry, did you finish with that tape? No, I got more. MAXWELL: Well, save it for the new girl. We got a special order on this one. HENRY: You want the video camera? MAXWELL: Is it connected? HENRY: Ready to go. You feeling pretty good, hon? [giggling] Please. Please. I didn't do nothing. Don't make me do it! Shut up, you yellow-bellied hippie! Do as I told you. No, I won't. Bullshit! Do as I told you! No, never! I don't care what you do to me! No, please don't. You do it right, and it'll be all over. Now get your pantywaist ass over there! [MUSIC GRIM REAPER, "ROCK YOU TO HELL"] [gunshot] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Sheriff Coale, however, was a mystery. He didn't seem as bad as the rest, but he did his part. Hello, Charlie. Weather's cleared up a bit. Sheriff Coale, what's up? Well, Charlie, we had another accident at the prison, and I, uh, I'd like you do the paperwork on it. Would you do that? I'll do that. Just, uh, just mark her down as another Jane Doe, would you do that? I'll take care of it. See you later. [sirens] Where were you going, young lady? Nowhere special. Would you like a ride into town? Yeah, that'd be fine. Why don't you hop in? Tomorrow I want you to get us a new girl, and make sure she's pretty, too. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Jud and the others who ran the place took special delight in the pain of other people. Pusker treated people like animals. Even though she had used Vicky to get at me, she had no loyalty to her. This time she would use Big Eddie to get Vicky. Hey. Big Eddie. Yes, Ms. Pusker. Ah, Warden Maxwell says there's going to be wrestling match. Yeah, who's the competition? Me and you? Nah, some girl the warden wants to get rid of. What's in it for me? What do you want? An evening alone with Sharon. OK, you've got it. But no rough stuff. BIG EDDIE: Sure. PUSKER: Here she comes now. Vicky! Move your ass over here! GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): And Vicky fell right into her trap. Yeah, what? You stupid bitch. You're standing on my garden. What garden, fatso? This garden. [MUSIC GRIM REAPER, "ROCK YOU TO HELL"] PUSKER: Come on! Stand up, all right? The warden's coming. All right. Any time, any place, I'll break your chicken neck. Listen, baby, I'll stick those pants up where the sun don't shine. Any time! Get back to work! [shrieking, laughing] Get me a beer, will you? Ah, fuck! Oh, man! Oh, fuck. That's funny. That's funny. Jesus. [shrieking, laughing] [car horn honking] [shrieking, laughing] Hey, you goddamn asshole! GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Sheriff Coale was about to be confronted with a situation that he had secretly known for a long time would happen. He had always tried not to think about it, though. But it was about to hit him right between the eyes. Sheriff! Sheriff! My name is Warren Clarke. I'm glad to see you. I'm Sheriff Coale, what can I do for you? I understand you found my daughter. Your daughter? My daughter, Sharon. Oh, Sharon Clarke. Who told you I found her? Mr. Holbrook. Mr-- To your left, your right, your left. Go to your left, your left, your right. Sound off, one, two. Sound off, three, four. Oh, I was born in-- I see. Petey. PETEY: Go to your left, your right, your left. Go to your left-- (CHUCKLES) Well, that explains it. I did have a young lady but, uh, she wasn't your daughter. She was that girl, Sheriff. I-- I know she had a red backpack dealy. Petey, Petey, Petey. What are we going to do with you? Right? We leave you here alone, and what you start doing? Exciting folks with your visions. Well, don't you remember, Sheriff? She wore the same hiking boots that she wore in the-- in the picture. Petey, every kid that passes through here wears the same wardrobe, right? I mean, boots, shorts, backpack, windbreaker. It's basically today's uniform of the road. All right? So the little girl you saw me with was a girl named Nikki. Nikki? Now while she did look like the girl in this photograph, well, she wasn't. That kind of hurt. I'm sorry, Petey. Look, why don't you go back there and take care your business, and I'll attend to these-- Well, Sheriff, you know, maybe you're right-- Petey, just go back in the kitchen, and I'll take care of these-- My brain got chopped. I understand. OK? Just-- I'm gonna go back and get the cheese sandwiches. Yeah, fine. Fine. I'm-- I'm sorry, folks. Are you sure, Sheriff? Could you be mistaken? Mr. Clarke, I would really know a face like that. Now I can't forget. Mr. Holbrook was so sure. PETEY: Sound off, one, two. Poor old Petey. Can't rely on what Petey has to say. I mean, every town has one, and Petey just happens to be ours. You know, Mrs. Clarke, I'm going to help you. I'm going to issue an all-points bulletin for among my deputies. Now I do have her picture, description, your name and number on the back. And if she's anywhere-- and I mean anywhere-- in this county, we're gonna find her. I'll tell you what. I'm also going to give you the name and number of a sheriff, Ken Richards. Now, he's over in Kern County. That's the next county over. I have a feeling that she might be there. I'll tell you why. Because your husband did say she likes the sites, doesn't she? And Nathan City's there, right? So if she's there, I think you'll find her. Thank you so much. And God bless you, Sheriff Coale. Well, good luck to you. PETEY: [singing] Where is he? Who? Doesn't he have responsibilities around here, or is he spending all of his time with that new chicken? Well, how should I know? I only work here. What's all the commotion here? I'd like to know why Sheriff Coale is taking charge of Gillian, of that new internee. I demand the prison be remanded back into my custody according to the rules and regulations. I'm aware of our procedures. According to the rules and regulations, I have complete authority over all the girls entering this facility. That's true. Then what right does Sheriff Coale have to remove a girl from camp for his own purposes without my consultation or consent? I'll look into it. If I were a man, I wouldn't have to put up with this. But because I'm a woman, I have to put up with this damn lot of double dealings. It's because I'm a woman, isn't it? I said I'd look into it. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): When Sheriff Coale wasn't available to bring back girls, the job fell to the big Indian named Jud. Jud had a slightly more direct approach than the sheriff. MAN: Hold that one. Hold that. Yeah. Perfect. Hold that. WOMAN: Wait. Once from the back. MAN: Yeah, perfect. Hey, turn around. OK, let's see some good ones now. Yeah, perfect. Yeah, all right. All right, yeah. Hold that. Hold that. JUD: [calling out menacingly] What the hell? WOMAN: Come on. Please don't start anything. MAN: Relax, man. Hold on! Hold on, man. I want to handle it. WOMAN: Come on. Please. Hey. The fuck's your problem? I saw your girlfriend French kissing a donkey on the reservation. [MUSIC GRIM REAPER, "ROCK YOU TO HELL"] You're gonna be sorry you did that. Amy, get out of here! OK. Come on, get up! Son of a bitch. Open the fucking door. Open it! Open it! The fucking door! Open the fucking door! No! [humming] [car horn honking] Son of a bitch! [gunshot] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Jud was every bit as good as Sheriff Coale in terms of bringing back new product. There was just one minor detail. He sometimes forgot to bring them back alive. [explosion] I want you to show her who's boss. Yeah, when she gets in here, I'm gonna break her in two. [laughs] Well, here she comes now. Take your time. Enjoy yourself. Make if fun. It's just a good thing she showed up. This is gonna be another short one. Punish her. Make her sorry she ever was born. OK. Here we go now. I want you to give us a good fight. The warden says he'll release you. Don't worry. I'll kill her to get out of here. [bell rings] [bell rings] Come on! Kill her! Little bitch! Now. Come on! Come on. Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Yes! Yes! [inaudible]. [inaudible]. SCRUGGS: Don't you think this has gone far enough? No, I don't. Ooh! [bell rings] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): So it was a wrestling match to the death. [bell rings] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): This was too much. But I knew if I got up and did something or said something, I might be shot on the spot. [inaudible]. Show's over. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): But I couldn't just sit back anymore. I couldn't not respond to the pain of those around me, like I didn't respond to my fellow cops when Ron got shot during that terrible arms bust. When we got back to our cell, Sharon was real upset. I tried to comfort her, but it was to no avail. The wrestling match had also heated up the bloodlust of some of the prison personnel. You two. Get out. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Sharon and I were about to become personally acquainted with Jud. Jud and one of the guards took us on a double date. Nobody owes me shit. And I don't owe anybody. My mom died when I was 11. Hey, I'm sorry, man. I heard my dad died in a knifing in some bar down in Arizona. Hey, at least my folks are alive. I'm gonna go see them next month. They think I work in an office somewhere down in LA. Little do they know. Bang! [laughing] Hey. How come we always got to do the warden's dirty work for him? All work and no play makes Jud dull boy. Hey, you all having a good time back there? [laughter] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): I couldn't let this happen. I had to fight back, no matter what the cost. You can't bring it here. You have no right! I don't need a reason. What's right or wrong doesn't mean shit to me. We're gonna have a little party, just the four of us. Now get back on the bed. Sheriff Coale is going to hear about this. I don't think I like your attitude. [grunts] You bitch! She's out. Leave her. Let's take care of this other bitch first. If the warden finds out, he'll be pissed. And if the sheriff finds out-- Don't worry about the sheriff. I could take care of him. The warden owes me. [muffled screaming] Anyhow, we'll be very gentle. You won't say a word to anybody, right? That wasn't very smart. You shouldn't have done that. If you move, you die. Do you understand? Please. Please. Stop. I'm about to be married. Good. I'll be glad to tell your husband what you were like in bed. Please don't. Please don't! Please. Very nice. I'm going to really enjoy this. [sobbing, screaming] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): That was it. Sharon was the most innocent girl you could imagine. I vowed there and then that I would not let this unspeakable horror go unpunished. I vowed that Sharon and the other prisoners would be free. I started to think of a plan. I knew a chain was only as strong as its weakest link. What keeps you here? What are you doing here? What do you mean? Well, it's obvious that we're all prisoners here. I don't mean in the general sense. We're gonna die here, aren't we? Why are they pretending? What is going on? You know, there's-- there's no keeping anything from you, is there? You know, Gillian, you are smarter than the rest. You're smarter and-- I don't know anymore. I know at one time it was the money, but you know, you can only make so much of it and then-- then it begins to lose its value. When I think what we've done, sometimes it just makes me sick. And these-- these horrible nightmares. We're in it too deep now. I just don't think we can stop. But you seemed so different from the rest. As if you didn't belong. Why don't we get away from here? Away from this living nightmare! It's not that easy. Oh, maybe a year ago might have worked. But I'm in too deep now. And I have too much-- too much blood on these hands. I could help you. We could run away together. Gillian, I-- I need to talk to you, Coale. This is insanity. Why Gillian? Why the hell don't you choose somebody else? Stop your bellyaching! There'll be others. This girl ain't no better than the rest of them. Besides I've already sold her to Doc Bass and that's the end of it. What the hell's the matter? You in love with this girl or something? What in the hell have we gotten ourselves into? Now, this has got to stop. Oh, slow down. No, it has to. Damn you. Damn you! In my entire life, I never met me a prime cut. They's all dead meat! Look, Coale, you can't let yourself get emotionally involved, and the sooner you get that through your head, Sheriff Coale, the better it'll be for everybody. Oh. Well, now I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to take Gillian and Sharon out of here. Now you can have my share of the money because I don't give a damn. I just want out! [door slams] I want you girls to get in the car that's parked out in the back. Well, come on. Let's go. Move, move! Let's go! Well, we have to wait for Sheriff Coale. Oh, why? I'm fine! He's got the key! Sorry, ladies. There's been a change of plans. Well, how long are we gonna be in here? Not long. [sobbing] Stop it. Stop it! Get a hold of yourself! We have got to figure out a way out of here, or we're dead. When they come back again, they're gonna kill us! Do you understand that? [unintelligible sobbing] Just get a hold of yourself. We need your help. I got this from one of the girls. Here's my plan. Huh? Holy shit. You stupid boob! You let a cop in here. Ms. Pusker, Gillian Kaites is a cop. Kill her. Kill her now! Her? Make a fool of me? Ha! It would be my pleasure. Take Big Eddie with you. You, uh, you need some help? I can handle it. I don't see her. [inaudible] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): Once I was out, I rallied the girls. We don't have much time. Donna, here's some gasoline. When you get to the east wing, pour it on the floor and light it. You get in trouble, use this. Let me get Pusker. I'll say hello for you. Sharon, wait here for me until I get back. Let's move it! GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): We bribed some of the guards to disappear. Hey, what are you doing here? I was hoping I could persuade you to be on the letter board. Hey, what's going on? What Maxwell wants doing, Kaites's dead. And I want to make sure she's real dead. You never needed artillery before. When did you ever need a gun? PUSKER: Gillian knows all that damn karate shit. She attacked Big Eddie, and I want to make sure she gets what's coming to her. SCRUGGS: Yeah, but you took Big Eddie with you. Two against one? PUSKER: I'm gonna put these shells into her. That'll stop her. SCRUGGS: What if she gets by you? [background chatter] Good night, guys. [screaming] Freeze! [gunfire] Gillian, get us out of here! [women clamoring] Going somewhere? Give me the gun. Don't be foolish. Now, give me the gun! [gunshot] Fuck! [explosion] [women clamoring] Hey, let me out! That you, Kaites? Come on in and get Coale. I'm sick of this bellyaching. I'm unarmed, and I swear on my baby's grave. [gunfire] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): I could see that poor Sheriff Coale was beyond help. It's over! [women clamoring] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): All the girls ran as fast as they could. Nobody looked back. As for the place, I suppose the authorities found it. It didn't really concern me now. [doorbell] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): We were so happy to put it all behind us that we felt like little children. Mom? It's OK, Mom. [crying] GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): I never realized how much I took freedom for granted until it was taken away. While I was enjoying myself at the party, I couldn't help but feel lucky for having survived the whole ordeal. I thought of Vicky, and all those other poor women who died in that horrible prison. They would never be able to enjoy life, to taste the sweetness of freedom. I was grateful at least that I was able to help Sharon. This wonderful little girl had made me care once again about myself and other people. Now, listen everyone. We all know we're here to pay tribute to two wonderful people-- my lovely daughter, Sharon, and my future son-in-law, Gary. My friends, I'd like to make a toast to the happy couple. To Sharon and Gary-- may your lives be filled with nothing but happiness. I'm so happy for you. What are you going to do now? Well, I'm going to put the pieces back together. And we're going to start a new life. I'm gonna work for a victims' rights organization. That's great. GILLIAN KAITES (VOICEOVER): I would never again lay down in submission. I had learned that there are times when we all must fight for what is ours. Nobody I knew would ever have to suffer again. Not if I could help it.
