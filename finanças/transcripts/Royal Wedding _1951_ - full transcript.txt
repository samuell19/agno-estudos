My royal day can be a royal bore It leaves me colder than a basement floor The only moment I keep waiting for Is when the day will be through I never notice if it's dark or clear What people say to me I hardly hear The passing hours are an endless year Until at last I'm alone with you Every night at 7 You walk in as fresh as clover And I begin to sigh all over again Every night at 7 You come by like May returning And me, oh, my, I start in yearning again You seem to bring faraway spring near me I'm always in full bloom When you're in the room For every night at 7 Every time, the same thing happens I fall once again in love But only with you Every night at 7 Every time, the same thing happens I fall once again in love But only with you May I say your performance was ragged? You were so slow going around, I almost caught you. Well, the audience seemed to like it. It's hot in New York in the summertime. I'm glad we're closing tomorrow. What happened to the air conditioning? Mr. Hiller probably turned it off to save money. Oh, would you blot my face too? Up here. It's trickling. - Who's Mr. Hiller? - The house manager. You've been playing his theater for a year and a half. That evil little man who comes around and pinches? That's your department, sister. I say let Mr. Hiller keep his air conditioning. He can't take it with him. Where he's going, he'll need it. Boy, it's hot. If ever I play a king again, I'm gonna be one of those Asiatic boys... ...who just wears earrings and a sheet. Hey, what's your hurry? - Pete. - Hi, Ellen, honey. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. - You know my brother, Tom? - I don't believe I've had the pleasure. - How are you? - I'm fine, sir. Thank you for asking. I'll be out in five. Oh, my, Pete. You look nice and cool. Make yourself at home, won't you? Sit down anywhere. - Oh, how was it, sir? - Hot. Oh, your agent stopped by to see you, sir. Irving? What brought him out this clammy night? He didn't say. He just told me it was imperative... ...that you and Miss Ellen meet him at McGuffie's bar after the performance. - Ellen? - Yeah? Irving wants us to meet him at McGuffie's. Okay. How'd you like Pete? Isn't he cute? He's from the South. No. Why, Ellen, honey, I never would've guessed it. He owns miles of tobacco land in Virginia. You ought to hear him chant. I met him at Hilda Swann's house and I'm mad about him. Is that all? - That's all. - Roger. Miss Ellen seems quite taken, doesn't she? This will be one of those affairs that drags on a weekend. The news overseas concerns the royal wedding in London. The British capital is festive in anticipation of the wedding, still several weeks off. - Towel? - Please, sir. As for the princess, the most-guarded secret since radar is her wedding gown. The princess herself will see it for the first time this weekend. - Chester--? - Please, Mr. Bowen. In Miami, a tropical hurricane seems to be approaching-- - Can I talk now? - Yes, sir. You know, I danced in Trafalgar Square the day her grandfather was married. I'd give anything to be there again this fall, wouldn't you? Yes, I like weddings provided they're not mine. Oh, marriages are very healthy, sir. Married men live much longer than bachelors. If that's true, they're trying to outlive their wives so they can be bachelors again. - Haven't you thought of getting married? - Once, as a matter of fact, I did. The lady changed her mind at the last moment. I've been deeply indebted to her ever since. Good night, Chester. I wonder what Irving wants. I hope it's something that-- My gosh, what a muscle. It's like cement. Oh, it's nothing. All us tobacco men get kind of strong. - What from? - Lifting money. Oh, come now, it wasn't that good. - Good night, Eddie. - Good night. - Good night, Eddie. - Good night. He's the only stage-door man I know who isn't called "Pop." - Hello, Will. - Hello, Ellen. - Gee, it's been a long time. - Hi, Irv. I couldn't wait for you backstage. What is with that heat there? - How was the show? - The first act was a-- - Dollboat. How are you, baby? - Fine, how are you? - You look so sweet tonight. - Oh, I do, don't I? Come on, order. I got big news. - Let's have it. - May I present Pete Cumberly? - How do you do? It's a pleasure. - Thank you. That's very nice. - Who is this square? - A friend. - A Tom Collins. - Nothing for me, thanks. - Hit me with a rye. - Shall I give it to you? - Come on, what is it? - My brother, Edgar, called from England. He's head of our London office for years. Mayfair Theatre wants your show for London. - No. - They want you during the wedding season. - England during the wedding. - I like that. - Oh, Tommy. - Ellen, does this mean you'll be leaving me? Yes, Pete. Isn't it wonderful? When do we open? As soon as possible. You've gotta rehearse the England cast. - Hit me. - What about transportation? - French boat's leaving a week from Monday. - Which one? Who knows with the name? It's in French. Don't worry. I'll get you on it. This means we'll be saying goodbye in 10 days. Oh, yes, Pete, and I'm so happy. - Ellen. - Oh, hello, Dick. I was waiting backstage, that's why I'm late. - Who is this fella? - Finish your drink, Pete. Did you hear the news? We're going to England during the wedding. What are you doing here? - What do you mean? Who's he? - A friend. What are you doing? I demand an answer. Go peddle your papers. When are you leaving? - That's an insult. - What's an insult? - What's the matter with you? - This is embarrassing. I forgot about Dick. Hope they don't hurt each other. We ought to start packing. - I have to buy new clothes. - You'll have time. - I'll send the company over. - I wonder what they'll be wearing. I don't know. Pay the man. - Yeah, sure. How much do we owe? - May I? - Yes, you may. - And keep the change. I have business to take care of. - I'll meet you on deck. - Okay, sister dear. Hello, Billy. This is goodbye. Thanks for coming down to see me off. It's hard saying goodbye after all we've been to each other. I know, it's been a lovely three days. But I'll be back soon. - Oh, dear, I must go now. - May I walk you up the gangplank? I'd rather you wouldn't. You understand? No. Well, it's just better that way. - Write to me, Billy. - I will. Goodbye, Ellen. I'll miss you very much, Linda. Knowing you these past few weeks has been one of the most exciting things... - ...that's ever happened to me. - To me too, John. - Pete. - Ellen, honey. I thought I went to the wrong deck. Well, you haven't much time. - Really? And I had so much to say. - What? - Well, you're gonna be away-- - Yes, I know, Pete, but what? Suddenly knowing you're gonna be away makes me realize my feelings for you. - So I thought I'd-- I mean-- Ellen, honey. - Visitors ashore, please. - Oh, Pete, you have to go now. Goodbye. - But, Ellen-- Write what you had to say, huh? - I will. - Bye. Barbara, knowing you these past few weeks has been one of the most exciting things. Oh, I'll miss you, John. - Goodbye, baby. - Goodbye, Irv. I know you'll be a smash. If you want anything, you ask my brother. - He's gonna meet you at the hotel. - So long. Bye. - So listen, have a good time. - So long, Ellen, so long. Well, all right! Bye, honey. Bye. See you soon. So long. See you. Hey, who are you waving at up there? My girl, right there, see? - That's my girl! - Oh, don't give me that. That's my girl. Hey. Hey. I'm betting 8-to-5 on Dixie boy. Wait a minute, wait a minute. This is not.... Hey, fellas, now look-- Poor Irv. Come on, will you listen? Stop it, please. Stop it-- - What a beautiful, beautiful day. - Isn't it wonderful? We don't know a soul on the boat, and we can have fun together. - Yeah. - Good day. Good day. Well, I don't know him, Tom. Honest, I don't. - I wanna write a letter. - Don't forget, we've gotta rehearse. - What time? - Two o'clock in the gym. - I won't keep you long. - I'll be there. - Now, don't be late. - Okay. - Good day. - Good day. There's carbon paper in the middle drawer if you want duplicates. I'm not writing a letter. I was just doodling... ...waiting for an opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Brindale. Lord John Brindale. And what's yours? Bowen. Duchess Agatha Bowen. Oh, no, no, really. What is it? Oh, let's see now, "E.B." "E," is that Ethel? Wait a minute. Bowen. Why, of course. You're Ellen Bowen, aren't you? - You're doing fine. - It's very stupid of me. I should've known. Why, I only saw your show a few weeks ago. Please forgive me. Oh, that's all right. I know you have a lot on your mind. Oh, I can explain those two little episodes that you witnessed yesterday. - Oh, you can? - Yes. Then go ahead. Then go ahead.... Well, you see, they're both terribly nice girls and they're both so fond of me... ...that I couldn't bear depriving either one of them. You know how it is. In order to be kind to people... ...one has to be a very, very good liar. But tell me, why were you following me? - Following you? - Yeah. Why, I was doing no such thing. I was only saying goodbye to a couple of.... - The same? - Yes. Does this sort of thing happen to you very often? - Oh, all the time. And you? - Constantly. - I guess we're both too kind to people. - Yeah. I have to get stamps. Do you live in New York? No. I've been there on business. But I'm just going home for the wedding. - The royal wedding? - Yeah. You're going to the wedding? Well, I'm escorting someone, yes. - Well, you really are a lord, aren't you? - I'm afraid so. My, my. Haven't you ever met anyone who held a title? Only Joe Louis. - I'm very glad that you're Ellen Bowen. - Why? Because that means that chap you're with is your brother, not your husband. - Do you know what I did last night? - No. What? I surveyed this boat and I discovered you're the most attractive girl. Well, thank you. And I kept thinking that, "What a pity that she's married... ...because that's gonna make things terribly awkward." But it isn't gonna be awkward at all now. - Thanks for the use of the hall. - Not at all. If you see my sister, tell her I'm waiting. - I will. - I like your boat. Thank you, monsieur. Oh, Monsieur Bowen. I have a favor to ask. On every crossing, we have a gala benefit for the disabled seamen. I was wondering if you and your sister would dance for us on that night. - We'd love to. Just tell us when. - One number would be sufficient. - We don't want to ask-- - No trouble at all. I know it's an imposition to ask you. I would feel so-- We'd love to. Don't worry, we'll do it. There's a fella that won't take yes for an answer. Come on, come on. Oh, fine. Thanks for showing up at rehearsals. John, this is my brother, Tom. Tom, this is John. - How do you do? - Glad to know you. - I picked up John in the Writing Room. - I gather. He's a real lord. - It's nothing at all. - Miss Bowen? - Yes? - Cable. Oh, thank you. Excuse me, please. Oh, Tom. Tom, it's from Pete. Says he's very blue, except for his eye, which is black. Let's forget Pete for this trip, shall we? Excuse us. Looks grim out there, doesn't it? - Yeah. - Monsieur Bowen? I'm wondering if you and your sister would dance right away... ...instead of 10:30. We're afraid of the weather. - Oh, you mean it might be a little...rocky? - Yes. That won't bother us. We can handle it. - Thank you. - Anytime you say. - I better change my dress. - Yeah. Open your eyes There's a sapphire sky above us High above us, made for you When you open your eyes Open your eyes There's a carpet of jade around us Laid around us, all for you When you open your eyes Let me show you the sights Take you on a tour Of this great, new fabulous world we own We alone So open your eyes And you'll see how this momentary Ordinary night can seem More unreal than a dream Oh, we can handle it all right. What do we do now? - Keep your balance. - Oh, sure. So sorry. - Certainly. Certainly. - Pardon us. - Tommy. - What? - Isn't it wonderful, Tommy? - It sure is. Hello? Yes? Oh, sure, yes. Yes, do come on up. Room 211, 12 and 14. - Okay. - Who was that? Edgar Klinger, Irving's brother. He's coming up. I'm so happy, Tommy. I wonder what the princess is doing this morning. Why don't you call and ask? Wonder what I'd be doing a month before my wedding. Trying to figure a way to get out of it. - Do you really think so? - You know you would, and so would I. Yeah. How'd you do? I'm Edgar Klinger. - We didn't know-- - That Irving and I were twins? - No, we didn't. - Oh, I must say. But he should have told you, you know. After all, this is a pretty box of pickles. - May I come in? - Of course, I'm sorry. - How do you do? - I'm so happy to meet you at long last. - My, it's amazing. - Yes, it is rather, isn't it? - I do hope the rooms are satisfactory. - Fine. - They're fine. It's a miracle you get them. - Yes, quite. The wedding has packed things up a bit. But then, there are ways. - How's everything at the theater? - Oh, seems to be humming. The dancers are to audition this afternoon. - The singers tomorrow. - Good. Excuse me. Hello? Oh, hello, Johnny, how are you? Ellen's boat romance, John Brindale. You know him? Know the family. Very old. They do say that young John is a bit of a chaser. He didn't have to chase very hard after Ellen. She stood still and waited. This afternoon? No, they're auditioning all day. Just a minute. Tom, you don't need me this afternoon, do you? John wants me to see his country home with him. It's all right, but I think you'd want to see who you're working with. Oh, I never notice anyone but you. John, I-- But I want you home for dinner. And no dates at night until we open. You'll come in at 4:00 in the morning and be tired out next day. Yes, Papa. It's all set. What time will you pick me up? Okay, I'll be ready. Bye, Johnny. - Shall we? - Yeah. - I'll see you at 7, and be back. - Oh, I will, I will. - Cheerio. - Goodbye, Edgar. Oh, and if there's anything you need, do call. - Thank you. - After you. Tell me, old boy, how are things in the colonies these days? Oh, fine, fine. These English clothes are terrific. Frightfully amusing tie, what? Yeah. Got a match? Thanks. I hear that shaving lotion's great stuff. - Do you ever use it? - Oh, every day. Sorry. I thought you were him. How odd. Thank you. Well, I must get back. You know where the theater is? - Sure. - I'll see you later. Cheerio. Okay. Hello again. I wish you'd stop following me. - Following you? - I'm not a bit flattered. - I'm Charles Gordon, your stage manager. - It's nice to see you. - Everything's ready, sir. - Oh, good. See that girl in the green dress near the end changing her shoes? - Yes, sir. - Let's begin with her. - They can each show me a few steps. - Very good, sir. - Your name, please? - Anne Ashmond. - Thank you. Will you begin, please? - Why, yes. Miss Anne Ashmond. - Will you try a few steps with me, please? - Oh, dear. - Can't you dance with a partner? - I could until a moment ago. Well, try. We'll take something easy to start. May I have a pickup, please? You should have seen your face when you saw me. - How did I look? - As if I were a dentist. - You dance very well. - Thank you. - I think you'll do fine. - Will I really? Sure. It's nice of you not to hold what happened against me. - I do, a little bit. - Well, what can I do? - You can have dinner with me. - Well, I should love to. - How about tonight? - Well, I don't know. I-- She'll do fine. Pick you up at 8. Thank you. Who's next? Is it much further? No, we're almost there. - My, you look pretty. - I know. - What do you have to do at the house? - Get the wedding present. We sold everything at auction except for one set of Coalport china plates. I was supposed to get those when I married. As there's precious little chance of that, we decided to hand them on. - Why is there precious little chance? - Oh, I don't know. You have to enjoy living with yourself before you have nerve to ask anyone else. Besides, you know how I am. Well, here we are. John, it's beautiful. Yes, it was. I think they're in here. - Oh, what a wonderful floor to dance on. - Yes. - How long since anyone's lived here, John? - Oh, about five years. No one could afford places like this today. I imagine you miss it terribly. No, I don't think I do anymore. I just don't have anything to replace it with. - I say, what time do you have to be back? - Seven sharp. I wish you could have dinner. I don't know when I'll get another free evening. There's some sort of party every night from now on. Can't you? I don't know. You know how Tom is. - Will you try? - Yes, I'll try. Good. - Hello. - Hi. Back on time. - How was the afternoon? - It was wonderful. - How were your dancers? - Dancers. What do you wanna do tonight? I'm kind of tired, Ellie. I thought I'd just skip dinner and go straight to bed. - Would you mind? - Oh, no, no. It's a good idea. That country air knocked me out. - Yeah. You sure you don't mind? - Oh, gosh, no. Matter of fact, I'll turn in now if it's all right with you. - It's a good idea. - Yeah. - It's been a kind of a rough day. - Yeah. - Good night, honey. - Good night, Tommy. Sweet dreams. Taxi, please. Thank you. Taxi. Thank you. - More coffee? - Thank you. Yes, Ellie and I have done quite a few shows together. Do you like to dance? Yes. Yes. It's hard work but it's fun. - What made you decide to dance? - Oh, a very silly reason. How silly? Well, when I was 11, I fell in love for the first time with a boy much older. - Twelve? - Thirteen. His name was Alonzo. And I was so happy that suddenly, all I wanted to do was to dance. So I figured that if I danced when I was happy... ...I should be happy if I danced. Is that silly enough? I think so. I felt so good about Alonzo, I used to close my eyes... ...and pretend I could dance all over the floor, walls, even the ceiling. If you ever learn to do that, I can get you a good booking. - Want anything else? - No. Let's go. - You'd better not take me home. - Why not? It's a long way. Besides, this is Friday. Friday, I have to stop and see my father. - I'd like to meet him. Cabbie! - All right. - What's the address? - 150 Mitchell Street. Could you take us to 150 Mitchell Street? Love to, guvnor. Love to. - Wait, will you, please, driver? - Love to, guvnor. Love to. See? That's my father. He's the proprietor. Oh, dear, I do hope he won't offend you. He's quite impossible. He and my mother have been separated for years. I have to stop here every Friday and get her money. - Why doesn't your mother do it? - Well, they're not speaking. I says to him, "McBride, every time you get four drinks... ...under that belt of yours, you become a nuisance. What's more, every time you fall down... ...you chip a piece out of the bar with your chin." So I says, "From now on--" Annie. Well, my little girl. How are you, dear? Hello, Jamie. Tom, this is my father. Father, this is Tom Bowen. - Glad to know you. - Pleased to meet you. To the royal couple. Bowen, eh? I used to know a Willie Bowen. Good old Willie. Married a girl we used to know named Gladys Hawkesley. I don't think you knew Gladys, Annie. Very happy they were for years. Then one night, Willie threw her right out of the window. Nobody knows why. But I always figured that they must have had an argument. I don't suppose you'd be any relation? - I don't believe I have relatives over here. - "Over here"? - I'm from America. - America? Get out of my pub! Leave. I'm not on speaking terms with the United States. - Jamie! - How dare you bring another Yank? - Out, do you hear? Out! - Wait, what's the matter? Matter? You owe me money, you do. Where is it? Here, look at this. Two pounds 10. Run up for your blooming soldiers. What do they do? Hopped it. Walked out without paying. - I'll not serve you a drink. - Stop it. To the royal couple. I can't allow Anglo-American relations to be threatened liked this. - I'd like to square that bill. - You shouldn't. Oh, sure. How much is that? Two pounds 10? - Let me see. There you are, sir. - There's a gentleman for you. Not at all like that other Yank you're so fond of. You can just add 10 bob to that and give it to me for mother. Has she found out when we go to the palace or is she keeping it from me? Three pounds, Jamie. You see, we sent a little token to the royal highnesses for the wedding. According to the papers anybody who did are allowed to see the wedding presents. - It's a nice custom. - Three pounds, Jamie. Oh, all right. Here. What you counting for? Don't you trust me? Just like her mother. No faith. You're 5 shillings short. That's what you might call a typographical error. Here. Thank you. We better go. Good night, Jamie. - Good night, dearie. Night, pal. - Night, buddy, To the royal couple. - Thanks. - Looks like Mother is still up. Since she and Jamie separated, she can never sleep till I get home. Let's walk a minute and get some nice fresh fog. Who's the Yank you're so fond of? Hal Rayton. He's my fiancé. - You don't sound very happy about it. - Oh, I am really. - Is it a secret? - No. Oh, this is ridiculous. He's in Chicago. - Illinois? - He lives there. - And you live here? - Yes. If you keep that arrangement after your marriage, you'll be very happy. - How long since you've seen him? - Oh, about two years. Two years? - You're still in love with him? - I've never thought of not being. - Do you hear from him very often? - Every few days, as a rule. I haven't heard from him for two months now. But he's probably been busy. I wrote to him and told him I was in your show... ...and asked him to call me opening night. I assume you have plans about getting together. - Oh, yes. - Are you going over there... ...is he coming over here, or are you going to meet in the middle? You see, he works in Ogilvie's Department Store in Chicago. Oh, well...? As soon as he makes enough to send for me... ...or I make enough to go over there, we're going to be married. That's fine. You don't mind, do you? - Mind what? - My getting married, I mean. I should love to go out again. I had a good time. So did I. Of course I don't mind. I'm kind of glad you're all tied up. Now we can go and have fun, without pressure. Yes. I guess so. - Good night, Anne. - Good night, Tom. Yes, this is New York. We have him on the line. Mr. Irving Klinger, we're ready with Mr. Edgar Klinger in London. - Go ahead, please. - Hello. Hello, Ed? This is Irv. - How are you, twinsie? - Buzzing, old boy, simply buzzing. I got a fast note by airmail from Tombo this morning. - He says everything is terrif. - Oh, well, that is good news. Tell me, have you heard from Tom? No, how are things? Oh, absolutely superb. I think we should have a fantastic opening night tomorrow night. Fantastic. What about Ellen? Tom having trouble keeping her caged up? No, quite the contrary. She's been frightfully conscientious. Goes straight home from the theater each night. Tom's the one who's been romping about. No kidding. What'd he do, catch himself a chick? No, no, no. Tom's quite well. He's taken a fancy to some girl in the show. Pretty little thing she is too. What I called you about, call me after the opening. That light in the window is gonna be me waiting. I will, old boy. Don't give it a second thought. Oh, by the by, how's the mater? - Oh, Mom's fine. - Oh, splendid. - Give her a peck on the cheek for me. - I gotcha. - Dig you tomorrow night. - Pip now. "Pip now"? "Dig you"? What's all the commotion about? Some regiment that hasn't paraded its finery in years. You can feel the excitement, can't you? After all, the wedding is only a week off. I wonder what the groom is doing this morning. Why don't you call him and ask him? - Very funny. - Well, I thought it was. What time did you get in last night? Oh, around 11, I guess. I didn't pay much attention. Well, I did. It was around 2. My, you're a busy little man these p.m.'s, aren't you? - We were just having a few laughs. - Just a few laughs. That's all. Come in. - Morning. - Johnny, a pleasant surprise. - How are you? - Fine. - Hi, John. - Hello, Tom. - As good a place as any to see the parade. - A sensational view. Before I forget, your ticket. Second row, right on the aisle. - Thanks very much. - What time is the parade? It should pass any minute. It's wonderful seeing you again. How's the show? Oh, just fine. Gee, it's been a long time. I know. Four days. Tomorrow night after the opening, Edgar's giving a party. You're going with me, okay? - It'll take a little doing, though. - Why? There's a huge affair. I'm supposed to take someone. You can get out of it, can't you? This is my opening night. Besides, if you don't take me, nobody will. I haven't been with a soul but you since I got here. I'll get out of it. - You're looking well these days. - Thank you. - I think about you so much. - I think about you, Ellen. - What? - I said, I think about you. It's so different from anything I've ever felt. - How? - Well, first of all... ...I'm not interested in anybody or anything I do. Now, that's completely new for me. I said, that's completely new for me. Ellen, I think this is getting very serious. What a parade. - I've never seen anything like it. - The parade? - Oh, is it over? - Wait, I'll tell them to come back. Ignore him, Johnny. I'm so excited about tomorrow night. Girl, we're due at the theater five minutes ago. Do you realize we've only been out at night together... ...about three times since I've been here? - Well-- - Come on. Come on. Well, just a minute. What's that you're playing? The song she's supposed to be rehearsing at the theater. Well, why don't you rehearse it here? Oh, that's a good idea. Is that all right with you, Tommy? All right. I wake up and sigh each morning Happy the night's gone by I wake up and pray each morning Pray that the day will fly And then I sit back and smile And dream of that day When I'll be standing by your side, My love The happiest day of my life How my heart will swell with pride, My love The happiest day in a lifetime Then as the last words are spoken The bells in the steeple will chime And I will love you so And you will see It will be for a lifetime! Hold it. Hold it, please. Charlie, what time is it? - It's 4 a.m., sir. - That's enough. All right, that'll be all for tonight. Sorry to keep you working so late. - What about our last two numbers? - We don't have to rehearse. - You were fine this afternoon. - I thought so too. - Show looks pretty good, doesn't it? - Not bad. Anne? - Excuse me. - Yes? - Don't forget tomorrow night. - The opening? How could I? Oh, yes, do try to make that, we'd love to have you. No, I meant afterwards. Edgar's giving a party. We'll go together. Oh, Tom, I can't. - You can't? Why not? - Hal is calling me. Oh, that's right. I forgot all about him. Well, it doesn't matter. I wouldn't bother except I haven't heard from him in a long time... ...and I do have to talk to him. - Taking the bus home tonight, Anne. - I'll be right with you. I'm sorry, Tom. Well, that's all right. It's all right. What time tomorrow, sir? Three o'clock for the company and 11 for Miss Bowen. - Yes, sir. - Eleven? What for, Tom? I wanna take those two we didn't do. - I thought you were satisfied with them. - There are still a few rough spots. Say, what happened to you? Did you get stood up? What are you talking about? What a manic-depressive life you lead. It's gonna be a marvelous party tomorrow night. I'm going with John. Who are you taking? Every night at 7 - Where's the key? - Well, you have it. I have not. I gave it to you. I'll have to go all the way down to the desk-- See? If you think nice things, all doors open to you. Is that your message for the day? Flowers! For me? I wonder who they're from. - Not from me. - Oh, well, that I know. - Who? - It's from John. - He can't make the opening. - He can't? My, what a shame. I had a feeling he wasn't gonna make it, but he just didn't know how to tell me. Now, isn't that terrible? Now, isn't that terrible? He's weak. And I just hate weak people. Yes, dear, I know you do. Up one minute, down the next. What a manic-depressive life you lead. All right, all right. So we're even. - Who you going with tomorrow night? - I don't know. Why don't you take me? Think we should go together anyway, don't you? - After all, we're the stars of the show. - Yes, I think we should. Miss Bowen, may I escort you to Klinger's clambake tomorrow night? Why, I'd be delighted. And what a surprise, you're asking me. Oh, Tommy, let's be terrific tomorrow night. - We'll be cosmic. - Stupendous. A smash. We hope. And, Ellen, don't forget. That's still the most important thing. Yes, Tommy. I know it is. - Good night. - Good night. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - You listen to me just once. - Oh, sure. - Wait. Sure. Yeah. Told you a million times. You never listen. All right, so I said it, so you heard it. So you're mad, so what? It's the last time I'll ever go to a party with you. - Will you put that in writing? - Always making cracks. - Like what? - My, you're always humiliating me. - Didn't your mother teach you manners? - Never had no mother. We was too poor. Say, what's the matter with you lately? You used to tell me you loved me. Used to treat me like a high-class dame. - Well, "usedn't" you? - So I used. - So you admit it. - I ain't admitting nothing. I'll give you one more chance. - Do you love me or don't you? - No, I don't. Quit stalling. I want a direct answer. Listen, kid, there's one thing about you I can't understand. How could you believe me When I said I love you When you know I've been a liar All my life You've had that reputation Since you was a youth You must have been insane To think I'd tell you the truth How could I believe you When you said we'd marry Why, you know I'd rather hang Than have a wife I know I said I'd make you mine Now wouldn't ya's know That I would go for that old line How could you believe me When I said I love you When you know I've been a liar You sure have been a liar A double-crossing liar A double-crossing liar All my doggone cheating life You said you would love me long So what? And never would do me wrong Stop bending the suit. And faithful you'd always be Me? Why, baby, you must be loony To trust a lower-than-low two-timer like me You said I'd have everything Get her. A beautiful diamond ring A bungalow by the sea A bungalow yet. You're really naive to ever believe A full-of-baloney phony like me Boy, I sure must have lost my head. You ain't lost nothing you never had. What about the time you went to Indiana I was lying, I was down in Alabama You said you had some business You had to complete What I was doing I would be a cad to repeat What about the evenings You was with your mother I was romping with another honeylamb To think you swore our love was real Baby, leave us not forget that I'm a heel How could I believe you When you said you love me Why, you know I've been a liar A good-for-nothing liar All my good-for-nothing life Hey. Hey. Hey. You know you've been a liar I know I've been a liar A double-crossing liar A double-crossing liar All your good-for-nothing life - Johnny. - Darling, I just had to come. I just had to. - Who's that with Ellen? - Who? - The chap with the accent. - Him? - Yes. - Brindale. - They've become very good friends. - Oh, yes. You think we should be getting to Edgar's? Later, Johnny. Tonight's my night. And tonight I wanna be alone with you. When you didn't show up, I didn't even feel like going on. - How'd you get away from your party? - Oh, I just walked out. I couldn't stand not being with you tonight. Ellen.... Ellen, I think we're in love. Yes, darling, I know. - Well, what are we gonna do about it? - Nothing. Well, we can't go on in this indefinite state. Well, aren't you happy? - Oh, you know I am. - So am I. Let's not kill it with improvements, huh? - But something might happen. - Like what? Someday, you might look over my shoulder and see someone else. - Someone else? - Yes. Too late now to forget your smile The way we cling When we've danced a while Too late now to forget And go on to someone new Too late now to forget your voice The way one word Makes my heart rejoice Too late now to imagine myself Away from you All the things we've done together I relive when we're apart All the tender fun together Stays on in my heart How could I ever close the door And be the same as I was before Darling, no, no, I can't anymore It's too late now Does Tom know how you feel? No, goodness, no. Do you think he'd mind? I imagine if he ever found out, he'd get us a booking... ...someplace in South Africa just to get me away from you. Would you forget about me in South Africa? But how could I? All the things we've done together I relive when we're apart All the tender fun together Stays on in my heart How could I ever close the door And be the same as I was before Darling, no, no, I can't anymore It's too late now - Who is it? - It's me, Jamie. Tom. Tommy, my boy. Come in. - You all closed up for the night? - Well, it's after 2. - But I'm never closed for you, Tommy boy. - Thanks. - The show went well? - Oh, fine, fine. I didn't feel like going home after the party, so I thought I'd say hello. Well, you're just in time. It was announced we go to see the presents on Monday. - Thanks. - I was about to try my suit for the palace. I'll slip into it. You have a look. Then you can tell me what you think. Sure. Oh, by the way, isn't this Anne's night to visit you? Yes, she was by about an hour ago. Picked up her money and stole away like a pickpocket. Did her call come through from Chicago? No, that blooming blighter never called. - She must be upset. - Well, I couldn't say. I don't know how Annie feels about anything. She's not an easy one to get to know. Very quiet, she is. But deep. At least, I hope she's deep... ...or else she's wasting a lot of her time being quiet. Well, brace yourself. What do you think? Do I look like a gentleman? Jamie, you look like a banker. - But do I look like a gentleman? - It's written all over you. I got it this afternoon from Percy Monroe. Last year, when he got pneumonia, they bought it for him to be buried in. But he recovered. Well, my only advice is... ...if you meet the royal family, I wouldn't bow too low. This is a wedding, not a coming-out party. I see what you mean. I'll watch it. - Are you excited? - Excited? No. I'm just scared. Nervous and scared. - Why? - It's meeting the old crow again. - Haven't clapped eyes on her in three years. - I know. If it wasn't for this royal wedding, probably I'd never have crossed her path again. On Monday, I'll call for you and take you down to meet her. I'll give you moral support. Now, that's nice of you, Tommy. Unusually nice of you. You're a good man, you are. I don't know what Annie's doing... ...waiting for this knucklehead in Chicago... ...when she knows a fella like you right here in town. - That's love, Jamie. - What about you? Do I look like the settling-down kind? Come on, let me out. I'll do the bending. I'm dressed for it. Thank you, Tommy. - Good night, pal. - Good night, buddy. Everywhere that beauty glows, you are Everywhere an orchid grows, you are Everything that's young and gay Brighter than a holiday Everywhere the angels play, you are You're like Paris in April and May You're New York on a silvery day A Swiss Alp as the sun grows fainter You're Loch Lomond When autumn is the painter You're moonlight on a night in Capri And Cape Cod looking out at the sea You're all places that leave me breathless And no wonder You're all the world to me Every night at 7 Come in. - Oh, morning. - Oh, hello, Edgar. Absolutely fantastic notices, every one. You could stay on for years. - Have you seen the dailies? - Rather. - We're so thrilled. - There's an eight-week call at the libraries. - There's been a what at the what? - The libraries, old boy. That's what we call our ticket brokers. They want blocks of seats eight weeks in advance. Why didn't you say so? Did you see the one where they say we're brilliant? - Where? - Here. - Edgar, have you called Irving yet? - I'm off to the office now. I'll take it in my room. Edgar, sit down a second, will you? - I want you to do a favor for me. - At your command. When you call Irving, ask him to find out what happened to a boy... ...who used to work at Ogilvie's Department Store in Chicago. His name is Hal Rayton. I've written it all down for you. - Oh, right you are. - Will you do that? And don't say anything to anybody about it, will you? - It shall be graveyard, old boy. Graveyard. - All right. - Thanks. Thanks. - Cheerio. This is New York. We're ready, London. Mr. Irving Klinger is on the line. - Hello, hello. - Irving there? Edgar here. - Hey, Eddie, so how are things? - Buzzing right along. Smash, huh? So how were the notices? - Wizard, old boy, wizard. - That bad, huh? No, no, no. Wizard. Wizard. - Oh, wizard! - Yes. Now, look, Tom wants you to follow up on a chap named Hal Rayton. R-A-Y-T-O-N. Hal Rayton? What does he do, a single? Mr. Rayton is not in the theatrical profession. - He ain't in the theater? So who needs him? - It's a personal matter of Tom's. When last heard from, Mr. Rayton was employed... ...at Ogilvie's Department Store in Chicago. Ogilvie's? Dig you. I'll throw the hassle to our Chicago branch. Have the whole mess in your lap in a fast two days. No, no. That won't be necessary. Just follow up on the Rayton matter and let us know. Natch. I just said-- Pip now. Oh, yes.... Dig you. Oh, there's Jamie for you. Wouldn't you know he'd be late even to the palace? Take it easy, Mother. Maybe the traffic was heavy. It's not the traffic. It's Jamie. Ever since I told him I don't like to be kept waiting... ...he's been keeping me waiting. You know, Mother, there's an old Spanish proverb which goes: "He who does not love the faults of his loved one does not love at all." That may be well and good for the Spanish, but I'm English. - Do you know what I think? - No. - I think he's all excited about seeing you. - Do you think so? - How do I look? - As elegant as can be. Tommy, tell him he's going too fast. - Could you slow down a little? - Oh, yes, sir. What do you say we have a quick one to the health of the royal couple? - Sit back, Jamie. We're not stopping. - Tell him to go slower. He can't go any slower. And don't be so nervous. Be sure you act like the gentleman you look like. I will. But one word of criticism, I'll hit her on the head with this cab. You'll do nothing of the kind. Here we are. Stop here, driver. We'll walk the rest of the way. Come on, now. Don't lose your nerve. Get in there. Go on. - Hello, Jamie. - Good day, Sarah. Jamie, your suit's handsome. Handsome. Thank you. - I'm sorry I'm late. - The traffic was heavy today. I told the cabbie to go as fast as he could. - Shall we go? - Allow me. Jamie, don't. I knew they'd hold. There are some days when you can do nothing wrong. - Do you think they'll stay together? - Sure. I hope so. For them as well as for me. I could never have left Mother alone. - You can get married and forget about them. - Yes. Yeah? - Good evening. - Edgar. I have the information you requested regarding Mr. Rayton. - Oh, what? - Well, it's nothing terribly exciting. Mr. Rayton still works at Ogilvie's. He's still in the Luggage Department. Used to live in Chicago proper, but not long ago he and his wife moved to Evanston. - His wife? - Why, yes. He was married several months ago. My, my, my. I say, who is this chap, anyway? He was engaged to a girl in the show. I was just finding out about him for her. Oh, I say, that's frightful. - Yes, isn't it? - Well, what are you so pleased about? I always smile when I'm heartbroken. I'd better tell her. Don't you think you should wait till after the performance? - It would seem kinder. - Maybe you're right. Edgar, you're a real pal. I'd stick up for you anytime. Thanks, old chap. That's frightfully decent of you to say. - Well, if you'll excuse me. - All right. I shall be around to pick you up tomorrow morning. - What's tomorrow? - Why, the royal wedding. I shall take you where you'll see all the pageantry. - Great. - Second act, Mr. Bowen. Right. I left my hat in Haiti In some forgotten flat in Haiti I couldn't tell you how I got there I only know it was so hot there She took my hat politely And wound her arms around me tightly But I remember nothing clearly Except the flame When she came near me Her eyes had the fire of surrender And her touch, it was tender And I guess in a moment as that You forget about your hat So if you go to Haiti There is a girl I know in Haiti If you can find her, you'll adore her Just look around till you've found Someone who has a blue-gray fedora I think of that gorgeous creature When I'm all alone Whenever I do from down inside There comes a groan That son of a gun in Haiti Has got the prettiest hat I own And when it is bleak and chilly And life is flat I think of that Haitian dilly And think I'd better go get my hat I left my hat in Haiti In some forgotten flat in Haiti I couldn't tell you how I got there I only know it was so hot there But I remember nothing clearly Except the flame When she came near me Her eyes had the fire of surrender And her touch, it was tender And I guess in a moment as that You forget about your hat So if you go to Haiti There is a girl I know in Haiti If you can find her you'll adore her Just look around till you've found Someone who has a blue-gray fedora Ellen. Ellen, got anybody to take you home? Good. - Good night, Mr. Bowen. - Night. - Anne, I've something to tell you. - Yes? I hope you won't think I butted in where I shouldn't have... ...but Jamie told me your friend didn't call. I didn't ask. He told me. I don't quite know why I did it... ...but I decided to try and find out what happened to him. Did you? - Yes, I did. - Well? Anne, he's married. Married? I'm sorry. How wonderful. How simply wonderful. Oh, Tom, thank you. Oh, it was nothing. Anne-- I've been worrying to death over him on account of you. And he's been married all the time. Isn't it wonderful? What do you mean on account of me? On account of me being in love with you and you being in love with me. - I'm in love with you? - Well, aren't you? Yeah. What a mess. Why? Next thing, we'll be thinking about getting married. - I'm thinking about it right now. - There. You see? Well, don't you want to marry me? Yes, I do. Anne, it isn't you. It's marriage. I'm afraid I couldn't be married and make a go of it. I've been living one way too long. With me, it's always been work. Everything else has just been a side issue. It isn't because I don't want to. It's just that I-- I don't know if I could change. Anne, I know I'd be an awful flop as a husband. Do you understand? I think I do, Tom. What'll we do? Perhaps you better take me home. Tom, I only disagree with one thing. What's that? I think you'd make a marvelous husband. - You do? - Yes, I do, Tom. - Hi. - Hi. - You're back early. - It isn't early. I thought it was. Well, it isn't. It's late. Is it? I didn't say anything. Tom, John wants to marry me. He does? That's funny. Well, it might be to you, but it's terribly serious to him. He's very much in love with me. And says he's found a new faith in everything, all on account of me. How do you feel? - Well, very constructive. - I never thought I'd live to see the day... ...you'd inspire anybody to do anything but slug it out. All right. Go ahead and make fun of me. I'm sorry, Ellie. You really are involved this time, aren't you? - Up to here. - What are you gonna do? Well, I don't know. I was rather hoping... ...you'd make up my mind for me like you usually do. It sure is funny. Why do you keep saying that when it isn't funny at all? - It's very important. - I know it is. I only meant it's funny because Anne wants me to marry her. She does? My gosh. - It sure is funny, isn't it? - Why? Well, I don't know. It's just funny, that's all. What's so funny about someone wanting to marry me? I have a few good points, you know. Tommy, are you really in love with her? - Up to here. - Oh, my. Well, I wonder what would happen... ...if we threw all our principles, went ahead and got married. - You'd stay here with John. - Why would I stay here? You can't go all over the world and leave your husband at home. - What kind of a marriage would that be? - No, I suppose not. - Well, what would you do? - I'd marry Anne-- - No, who would you dance with? - I never thought of that. Not having you, I might try Anne if she wants. She loves to dance and shows a lot of promise. - Do you really think so? - Yeah. I thought she was a little awkward myself. So were you when you started. Well, I know it, but it takes years to build a good team. - You always said that. - There's excitement in doing it. - Well, it just isn't fair, Tommy. - What isn't? - I'm getting the short end of the stick. - What? You want me to get out of the way... ...while you go with someone else and have fun. It's rotten of you. Simply rotten. - I didn't ask you-- - Everything's been perfect. We've had a wonderful life. We've been very successful. How can you consider breaking it up? Breaking it up for what? To get married. - No, marriage is a tough business. - I've always-- Responsibilities, obligations. A home to take care of. Maybe children to look after. Imagine being married to someone you're dancing with. If the marriage or the dancing doesn't work out, both go kerflooey. No, Thomas. It's a terrible chance to take. - It is, isn't it? - We mustn't do it. We've slaved too hard to get where we are. Why give it up? It does seem foolish. We're a team, and a darn good one. We ought to stay that way. - Maybe you're right. - Well, of course I'm right. You do see it, don't you, Tommy? I see it. It's you and me, just like it's always been. I'm sure we're doing the right thing. Thank you so much for deciding for me. Forget it. What a lovely day for a wedding Happy are we to say It's a lovely day for a wedding Lovely in every way The sun is out without a doubt To see what all the joy's about For everywhere The world is merry and gay What a lovely day for a wedding Over again we say It's a lovely, lovely, lovely wedding day What a lovely day for a wedding Happy are we to say It's a lovely day for a wedding Lovely in every way The Royal Guard is off their guard And drinkin' Scotch at Scotland Yard Big Ben has quite forgot The time of the day The time of the day What a lovely day for a wedding Over again we say It's a lovely, lovely wedding Lovely, lovely wedding - Lovely - Lovely - Lovely - Lovely Wedding day - Hello. - Good morning, old chappie. - Hello, Edgar. - Good morning. I've come to take you to the wedding and what a wedding parade we shall see. - Are you ready? - As ready as I'll ever be. What's the matter with you two? You're at sixes and sevens. Nothing's the matter. Let's go. - Tom, I want-- - Ellie, I've got to have her. I lose. So do I. I wanna get married, and today. - Today? - Before I change my mind. - Think we can do it? - We must. We wanna get married. - I thought you two were related. - No. We wanna get married today. But it takes three weeks. Anything can happen in three weeks. You can fix it. - Irving said you could do anything. - I know. But one must have permission from the archbishop. - He's busy today. - You've got to swing it for us. I'll try. You two meet me at the vicar general's in two hours. If it's possible to get permission, you shall be married this afternoon. - Where? - Clyde Street Church. I know the minister there. This is a pretty box of pickles. - I beg your pardon. - What do we do? - We have to find Anne and John. - In these crowds? I know what corner she's on. Where's John? He should be leaving the abbey for the reception. Well, you'd better find him. Ellie, I'm gonna miss you a lot from now on. - Tommy, you're a wonderful brother. - Good luck, darling. - Good luck, Tommy. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Will you excuse me? - John! - Ellen, what's the matter? - John, I wanna marry you. - What? - I said, I wanna marry you. - You do? Yes. Meet me at the Clyde Street Church at 4:00. - Right. - Here, here, here. - What do you think you're doing, miss? - Oh, officer, I love you. Anne! Anne! Tom. - Will you marry me? - What? - Will you marry me? - Yes. - Goodbye. - Bye-bye. They didn't have to go to all this trouble. A small wedding would have been all right.
