Ma! What are you doing here? Who's he? I've been discharged, Ma. Look. Aren't you tired of trying to fool me? Who's he? I got a deferment, Ma to avoid court. This guy's a buddy of mine. I just got out of the hospital. Is he the one who was looking for you that other time? If you don't stop I'm leaving! Stop what? Three years of lies. Turn on the light and give me my glasses. Where's Stratos? Mrs Kostoula... Come here. Go on, read it. I had only seen his brother. I didn't date go to his mother... when I learnt the army and the police were looking for him. I brought you a pomegranate. -Where did you steal it from? -From Afalona. We always had plenty of fruit in the house when I was a kid. Every morning my mom she asked me where I found them. There was a guy selling it outside the tavern, I'd say. -Know who I am? -Lakis. -Love me? -Where are you staying? -Here. Don't you want me? -It's my grandmother's house. Should I go? -Are you raising it? -So I can have some company. -Where's your mother, kid? -I don't know. In her house. Go get us something to eat, we've been up since morning. I've got some beans. Good! And give us a few money so we can go out. I don't have any money. For the first time no one was after him. We had spent an exhausting week at the military hospital... until we got a temporary discharge. He spent 25.000 on me. -You're... -Christos. -I heard you'd come. -Word is out already. You have papers or will they be after you again? -Show him, mum. -Let them eat. Your name is Christos? It was the first and only time she addressed me that evening. With Stratos we hit it off right away. And when Manolis told the story of the hospital... Stratos listened attentively, perplexed. And how come you, a stranger, helped him so much? Stratos is a good guy. He went to high school for two years and knows how to speak. Manolis, come and sit down. Get us some glasses. -What have you done with Zoe? -Drop it. -What were you doing with her? -Manolis. Do you know that she threw herself at me after you left. Sit over there and I'll be right with you. -Where did you find him? -We didn't. He just came along. -And the girl? Isn't she with you? -Come on now! What d'you care about the girl? Manolis admired Alogoyannis, his older cousin... and had imitated him in everything. He was a shepherd who found himself owner of two butcher shops. Then came his downfall. Now he only has about 100 sheep. He had one weakness: the women who came for the baths at the spa. -Hey, dude. -He's a regular little devil. He's already riding a bike. What's this, buddy? Your third leg? He's got a jock that's that big. As a kid he'd ask his mother... "Am I growing another leg?" Do you understand now that jarheads shouldn't take you for a fool? When did I ever call you a fool? You'll get drunk again and start imitating the Prime Minister. Last night I had a couple of drinks and starting imitating Papandreou. When I drink I laugh. Look at you... never setting foot in the house... He hasn't been home in a week. I'm not going anywhere tonight. What did you see in the old cows, damn you? We'll have a high old time! -Stratos is waiting for us. -Forget about Stratos. Alexandra lives here now. She's engaged to the baker's son. She's lucky. Know how much money he's got? I talked to him. "See that we don't have any stories with her or you're finished." He's a good guy. Doesn't smoke or drink. I even tell Alexandra, "He seems very quiet. Is he a..." We met a couple of years ago. Remember me? I know all about you and I know how you feel. My son was in trouble too. But now he's married and settled down. Cut out the shit and get us something to drink. Please stop shouting Yannis, they'll hear us. New blouse, I see. Did you make it with the salesman? I'm Eleni. Your name is Eleni but you didn't say where you're from. From Katerini. Does it matter? All these years I've known you, you little whore, all you do is lie to me. Don't shout! You'll make us the laughing stock. Now Manolis became the centre of attention... talking about his drama and troubles. And I felt left out. trying to understand the strength... which lay hidden in these two women on the last flutters of love. For their sake Yannis had lost two butcher shops. Sit closer. -Want to go for a drink? -At this hour? Why not? We don't work tomorrow. -Come on, Elpiniki. -You little vixen. Okay. Wait outside while we change. They're changing their panties. -We'll get them to give us a blow job. -Man... After a couple of drinks she's out of it. And that's when the fun begins. Okay? They'll give us a blow job each. -Do it for my sake. -You've got to be kidding. Please, do it for me. I thought we were going some place else. This establishment is not good enough for Madam? Ilias! Wine for us... and ouzo for the lady. Good thing I'm leaving on Wednesday and I'll get some peace. -Give me a kiss now. -Go to your wife. Ilias! Bring me another one. -Take it easy, Eleni. -Cheers, friend. She's pure gold, a rock. With her by my side, I don't need any of you. I didn't expect that of you. Who d'you take me for, trying to pass me off on your cousin? -Ilias. -Come on, now. I was on to it right away but I kept my distance. We just came here for a drink. -Right, Christos? -That's very nice, what you said. He's a good kid. I could tell from the flowers he gave us. But it wasn't right. Well, will you bring them or what? Things began to turn nasty. Alogoyannis is looking for an accomplice in me. I can feel the pressure on both sides. I tell them that friendship is not far removed from love. "You must realize Manolis has been in jail so long." The ouzo! No, Yannis, we've said not this sort of thing here! Wine! -Go on now, Eleni. -I'm not going anywhere. I've been with him for seven years and what did I get out of it? But I didn't expect that. -What happened? -I'd tell you but... You'd tell me what? If it was my fault I'm sorry. Never mind. It happens. Eleni is too sensitive. -No, girl. -Go on, he's waiting for you. We are all together here. Let's go, I don't want to find my friend with her throat slit. The check! You go, I'll get them a cab. Goodnight. You're a real gentleman. -You're late. -Kostoula, you know I love you. -Cut it out. -Don't I love you? -That's what you always do. -Mummy, I do love you. When you were ill, I washed and scrubbed. I've helped many times and no one said "thanks". -How do you get along with Stratos? -I keep telling him to get married. Does the vineyard belong to Stratos? It's yours. Stratos has his mother's inheritance. Do what you want with the vineyard. But keep the house. I'll come grow old with you. -Or you'll follow me everywhere. -Stay here and get a job. We've got to fix up Alexandra too. -What if they want the house? -What for? It's a wreck. I'm going to help them harvest their olives. I'll come with you. You do the job you've been trained for. I'm not gonna leave you. Let me give you a kiss. Good night. Where's Yannis, Manolis? He stayed behind at the tavern for a couple more drinks... Yanoula's shouting woke me up early. Alogoyannis hadn't come home! Kostoula made me some coffee. -Did you sleep here? -Where did you want him to sleep? How should I know? At the hotel? How can you drink it black this early in the morning? Let me see your I.D. -Come on, Ma. -You keep out of it. With all the things she's seen... it's only natural she doesn't believe a word you tell her. I'm going to go to Father's grave and light a candle. I dreamt about him the other night. "What are you doing here?" I told him, "you've passed on." "What are you saying, Kostoula," he replied. "Go away, my good man, you're dead." You upset him, but he kept telling me... "Don't upset yourself, he didn't become a thief..." "he's just deserted from the army, he's not a criminal." Don't start saying I was the reason he died or I'm leaving. Come on, I'll show you Thodoros. He was killed on the railroad tracks. There were four in the car. He's the only one that died. He was a great guy. Let's go see your father. He'd got mixed up with pills and such. He was married... When his kid was born, he stopped his wife from working as a hooker. I've never seen a guy with so many broads. But he's the spitting image of Stratos! When we were at Yota's house, Manolis got the photo album. He wanted to show me how he was when he was younger. Did you see Thodoros Yokaris' tomb? His brothers fixed it a year after his death. Good kids. Only they're on pills. You look like a girl. I had a toothache once and they wanted to give me a pill. -But I was scared and didn't take it. -They live here? Two of them do. Thodoros was the most good looking. He was the one I liked. Got a pair of pants for me so Ma can wash these? We wear the same size clothes. I bought him the pants he's wearing when he was in prison. I used to be overweight. My breast was huge. After the second baby I slimmed down. This is Giorgos, my first fianc√©. -He was killed with his motorbike. -I didn't want to marry him. When they brought him home, I locked myself up in the other room. Then I grew to love him. Then he was killed. Then they married me off to Andreas. I didn't want to get married. I liked going with my girlfriend, Vasso... and take her father's sheep out to pasture. Eventually, you get used to everything. -The kid is outside? -No. -Where is he? -We went to see father. Christos lit his candle. They brought him to the funeral under guard. He was completely broken up about it. He loved his father. They drank together every evening. As soon as they told me in jail, it broke me up. I don't know how I came to the funeral or how I got back. I only remember bending down and hugging and kissing him. After we were told all the news by Yota, we set off for the spa. We took Andreas' bike. He was still away. What's going on? -I got out with a temporary discharge. -Your mother alright? I used to go up and see her. She'd cry and I'd cry. I'm off to feed my boss's dog. Let's get together tonight. -I'm a waiter at the cafeteria. -Okay. 18 months in prison... because he helped a friend of his elope. He almost went mad. We were good friends. -Do you hear me? -Yeah! He made me the cross I'm wearing when he was in jail. He used his boots' shoelace. We'll see who you'll have for company this time. Don't remind me of it or I'll run this right into the sea! Manolis' trial for his third desertion was still pending. The deferment he had obtained did not mean that he had got off. And so we lived in uncertainty over the outcome of the trial. And we didn't know when it would be held. We were very busy this summer. But it'll be quiet in winter. Are you the only one at the cash register? In the morning. So if we run short we can come to you for a refill... In the morning time. Are you staying on here? You were a good boy but you changed. It's high time you got married. Find a woman to put you back in order. Men should settle down as soon as they're 25. Women when they're 18-20. But men, at 25. When my youngest finishes with the army I'll marry him off. I feel like hitting them all. How understandable murders in the country now seem to me! But there is, they say, some good in this story. Lefteris loves Alexandra. I have no complaints so far. But if I see any funny business I'll get my whip. Kostoula had given her daughter away all by herself... to ensure a better life for her. Her brother was in prison for three years and came back tattooed... with an unsavoury woman in tow. what could she do? Her courage fails her, she finds it again and carries on. She also has her son's shotgun. You'll never sell that as long as I live. You know what a good shot he used to be? He never used to come home with fewer than twenty birds. It was piece of cake for him. While Stratos simply lay in wait for them. One, two, none... He was walking around the mountains. Tell about the time the policemen were after me, Ma. He was just a kid. He didn't have a permit. They even came here, looking for him. She got scared. They told her I would go to reformatory. You were just a kid. But they didn't find him. It's not like they wore themselves out looking. Then he came back with a bunch of blackbirds. The shotgun's the only thing I bought for myself, when I was at sea. I sent everything here. She regards the shotgun as a sign of strength in the house. She doesn't care about her clothes or plates. She fights on like a man, like an outlaw. That is why she wants her rifle. I have a complaint. You should have let me know in prison when you gave Alexandra away. I went to the betrothal alone. They're good people and rich. -Panagiota didn't come? -No. Is Lefteris inheriting the bakery? -They haven't come up at all. -We went to see them. -When did you go? -This morning. What did you talk about? Things in general, what did you want us to talk about? You went by Alexandra's? -What did they say to you? -Ma, you're driving us crazy. -Make us some coffee. -We're all out. We drank it this morning. And I didn't go and buy any. -Want to go to the square for coffee? -It's on me. I'm going to the tavern for a glass of wine. I'll be by later. He's strange. There's no understanding him. I kept trying to understand... the power struggles within the family. I could never have done what you did. I have my work. He immediately tried to find excuses for himself. We didn't grow up together with Manolis and the girls. We rarely got together. Usually I was away. And when I was here, Manolis was away. When I left to go to sea Alexandra was just a child. In this place it is as if all family ties have been abolished. Manolis never remembered sitting at the table with his parents and siblings. Are you best buds with Stratos? What was he telling you? When he comes to Athens he'll drop by the house. Wait a minute. Half a kilo of coffee. Anything else? Good kid, I don't know how he hasn't beaten up anyone yet. Manolis seemed to harbor a secret admiration for Grigoris. He stole a motorbike. He was high. He took it and disappeared. He'll be by. He went to the dentist. -Is he on pills? -You want coffee? Get us a couple of gins. -Now what happened? -Nothing, just scratches. I didn't see a pothole. I was going full speed too. -I'll be with you shortly. -We'll be waiting. I had met Alekos at the military hospital. He had crashed with his motorbike. His arms are full of scratches. His sight is very bad... but has no intention of wearing glasses. He has magnificent eyes and thinks it absurd to hide them. Don't say I don't look after you. He's the best. I brought the tape just for you. We've been through some rough times. Remember that broad who came to see me in jail and I made you kiss her? -And when I touched her, I came. -Man... I met this broad last summer and did her out of fifty grand. I told her, "You'll give me twenty grand. I need it." She said she would send it. So I called her. -"I want fifty," I tell her. -"I can't,", she says... -"my husband will know." -"You don't love me", I say. -"I do", she says. -I hang up. -I call back. "I want a hundred". -"Are you crazy?" she says. "I really need the money." "Okay", she says, "I'll see what I can do." Don't go away, you jerk. -I can't stand the village. -Screw them! Know how much I make? Nearly eighty. And I don't need anyone. I wondered whether everything here could be exchanged for money. Manolis told me that Alogoyannis had a younger son... he had given up for adoption and took the house where he lived in exchange. "Captain", I ask, "if you had a daughter would you let me marry her?" "Oh sure," he says. "Why, Captain, aren't I capable of being a family man?" "You?" he says, "You'll have seven kids and turn them all into bikers." "In that case," I tell him, "I'll open a bar"... "hire a couple of women and strike it rich at least!" A real character. Remember what he looked like? Shall we have another drink? Call Michalis. Where are you going? Have a drink. I'm off to see my old man and hit the sack. Hitting it off, I see. In the summer we have a ball picking up tourists. Forget it, Michalis. I don't chase after women. You live in Athens? What line of work are you in? Want my I.D.? Get me a grilled sandwich 'cos I've got no teeth. I get off in 15 minutes, then we can go wherever you like. We've got to be going. The drinks are on me. How're you set for money? What do you think? Want anything else? He was the only one who came to see me in jail... I was playing football and they called me. The coach is looking for you. He found out you are here and wants you to play. -You are staying, aren't you? -I don't know. Remember what the shrink told you? "Don't think so much," he would tell him, "take up soccer." You told him that I play soccer. Are you staying? I let things take their course. I've cut out going down to Athens. At one time I'd go every weekend on the bike. It only means trouble. We set off down the road to the village on foot in silence. When we got to the square I got up the courage to ask him. Do I know? I may come for a few days to unwind. We'll see. What's this you're watching? It's a detective story. Say, Ma, can you read the subtitles in time? Sure can. If I lived in other times I'd have been educated. And why didn't you give me an education? What education? I had to chase you just to get you to go to school. He would come, throw his satchel and go to the mountains. Hunting, friends, fishing. Good thing Yota did his homework for him. But he was always first in sports. So, Ma, what's the movie about? He's killed some big shot and they're all after him. The police and some other guys. He loves the girl and she loves him. But she's involved in something and they're tailing her. Just like Zoe. Remember Zoe? -Do I remember her! -Tell Christos. There's nothing to tell. Ma, you know she brought in the money. I can't believe men would go with this woman. Why? She was no good. Still, I have no complaints. She did whatever I told her. At first she called me "old lady". "Now see here," I tell her, "don't call me old lady again." "Call me whatever you like. But not old lady." So the poor thing called me mother. But you're not bringing her here again. Christos, did he take up with her again? -I rather think not. -Goodnight. Manolis began a game with his mother. Every so often he would say goodnight and then start a conversation again. They spoke of what was said about him in the village... and also about Zoe. Goodnight. Yota caught up with her at the ferry boat. "I've got to go, Yota", she said, "and save my sister." Panagiota asked about her parents. "Anyway," says Yota. "Œ•ou shouldn't have sneaked off." I didn't care she left. I was worried about how he'd take it in jail. The next day forced me to come to some decisions. I no longer had any excuse for staying on. So i tried not to think. -Who's he? -Let me see. -Uncle Manolis. -That's not true. Same thing in the morning. Kostoula read us our fortune in the coffee dregs. Manolis' foretold money, women, a wedding wreath, rings. It was crystal clear. And she told me that I would talk with someone. I also see someone coming into your house. See it? It's Manolis. -We are going to Athens, aren't we? -Athens? -He's staying here to work. -Don't press him until the trial! He'll work. What else can he do? We need the money. -The jewelry you got for Lefteris? -Yes. I'm 24 years old and I've never worn a watch. -And she went and bought rings. -I had to. -What's gotten into you? -We woke you up? And you want to go to Athens. You stay here and settle down. Start training. I've got your papers all ready. -When did you do that? -While you were away. And if you buckle down to it you'll play on the team. -Any jobs going at the quarry? -There's always something open. Good thing you came, pop down and get us some bread. I want to come too. Bless him. A quiet kid and he loves his work. Plenty of jobs, if you have a mind for it. Only I think pimping is all you're good for. -I was just kidding. -Don't worry about it. -Where's Andreas going? -To get us some bread. Are you getting any food ready? -Here, come and get it. -Where are you going? -To the cafeteria. -Can't you go in the afternoon? Don't be late. We're eating here. I haven't cooked anything. Your uncle gave me the invitations. Your brother. He's expecting a gift. Well, I don't intend going. Not that I have anything against the girl. But he looks the other way when he sees me. Except when he told me I was no longer a member of the family. Fuck him! -Panagiota! -Whatever I did I only harmed myself. Why should we send him a gift? I sent him a bottle of Beau Mec. Cologne for the likes of him! The house in the next village will soon become vacant. Why? You want to leave here? I've arranged everything. -You're not leaving here! -You stop it. Don't you butt in because you fucking well turn my stomach. We left before I could become aware of what had happened. Twice I found him in her house. He wanted to say hello too. Whenever he would see me, he would invite me for a drink. Well, one time it got too much for me and I beat him up. Then I went and turned myself in. It was the second time I'd gone AWOL. Good thing he didn't nail me, or I'd be in trouble. Yota had a lover from the next village and wanted to live near him. Manolis appeared deeply hurt by this fact. Wouldn't it have been better to talk to Yota instead? She got what was coming to her too. I made her black and blue. Why don't you let them be? I don't understand that. I'm a country boy. I considered it dangerous for him to stay here. I don't want you to get upset, okay? Why don't you stay and I'll go to Athens? What would you do in Athens without me? I'll get a job in construction. I'll get a flat and you can visit anytime. I didn't mean that. Forget what you wanted and didn't want, it's not my style. And where will you leave Grigoris? I told you there's nothing between us any more. He's like a brother to me. Are you leaving at noon? We haven't decided yet. -Are you going too? -I don't know. -Is everything okay? -Yes. Why do you ask? Fine. I'm off. Have a good trip. How many tickets shall I get? Forget it. I'm staying. I went away certain I was leaving behind me some unfinished business. No, he had never spoken to me about Grigoris. But his insinuations before I left hammered in my mind... while I waited for his call. How could you have left him there alone? They'll tear him apart. Yet Grigoris had ignited flames of jealousy... and I had begun to lose control. He got all he could out of you, honey. He just wishes he could have taken more. All he knows, is take in return for the pleasure of his company. When he called me the first time I was harsh with him. Take me away from here. Don't leave me all alone. I didn't go that first weekend. I couldn't get away. Not that I tried it. He started calling me up increasingly late every night... and always drunk. Whatever happens remember that I love you. Come and take me away. That night there had been a brawl at the "Havaneza" club. They fought with some guys from Seliana. -They said he was a cop. -Try not to get into trouble. When you're one of the gang you can't stay out of it. My shirt is full of blood. My feet ache so much I can hardly feel them. Still, my muscles have firmed up. Here, feel. Yes, I can see. What happened? You made it through practice? Of course I did. At first it was hard. That jerk made us do 15 laps. -Shall we get some coffee? -Get on. No way. I'll walk. I like walking. Fine, we'll meet up at Michalis' place. I was getting increasingly worried. Now I kept thinking how I would face his mother. How were things at his place. I'm coming to Athens for a couple of months. See if you can find me a room. I couldn't hack it. I left at three. Did we have to consume all that booze? -Booze? I went hunting afterwards. -But I went to work. He and Lefteris are really close. He's settled down since he got engaged. Gone are the days when he'd strip the fags. Last year he made big money out of some fag. Ask Michalis. He knows all about it. -Would you ever go with an old man? -What can I tell you. A hole is a hole. Man, woman, donkey. I remember once, when I was in the army... I fucked a donkey. The next day the whole regiment knew about it. Our C.O. says to us... "Didn't I tell you it's better you do it with each other?" He asked me to go with Lefteris to buy bullets. Obviously he had something he wanted to tell Grigoris. I don't have 9 mm. Only 6 mm. Okay, 6 mm. Do you have money to pay or shall I go get some? I put in three days' work for Lefteris. I collected wood for the fire place. Do you know how much he loves me? At first he liked Stratos. But since I've been back he's nuts about me. -My nails hurt from playing ball. -You should cut it now and then. I guess so. What were you talking about with Grigoris? Nothing. -He was telling me his troubles. -Has he been giving you pills? Cut it out. -I'm dead beat, Ma. -He didn't come home at all yesterday. He went hunting. He's nuts, what can I do with him? Shut up you malicious woman. Know what she was telling me this morning? "The bastard didn't come home again last night." No kind words for anyone. Even tried to say something about you. But I stopped her. They're serious kids, I tell her. "What about the girl that was with them?" she asked. And I said, he's a friend of Manolis. "Manolis, is he gay?" "Pity, because he's a good-looking guy." I felt mercilessly besieged by the closed society of the village. Fortunately Kostoula found the solution. the words "he's a friend". But I was sure that in this war Manolis was not entirely disinterested. Don't bother. I'm not eating. -You just finished? -Yes. He was friendly as always, formal, distant... with a profound anguish in his eyes. He had a different kind of charm. I'm fixing up the kitchen in a small house I have by the sea. Electricity and water. -For the summer? -For year round. I'm getting out of here. The place isn't big enough for us. Is Manolis coming down with you? -We haven't said anything yet. -He's not cut out for life in Athens. Leave him here, so he can get a job. He's lazy. "Dig up this debris and clear the place, I'll pay you" I tell him. It's been a week now and he's not done. Wait until he finishes with the court martial. Then he'll settle down. -The engagement's off! -What engagement? The girl's father is against it. Scared we're after his sheep and property. -You know what I mean? -Do you like her? She's okay. Only 15 years old and a little dumb. -What's her name? -Vaso. -In other words it's finished? -Not yet, but I told you. Her father's scared I'm after his money. Fucking hell it's too early for bed. I suggested we go and see Yota. He started insulting her for still wanting to move away. She had also convinced Andreas. Forget it. Big deal. The girl's pretty I'll grant you that, but flighty. You should see how she wiggles her ass when she walks! Between us the man does have a point. -You're not too level-headed either! -Why? Got any complaints? What will you do with a 15-year old kid? He'll be able to make her the way he wants her. And how will Manolis get along with a 15-year old? Why not? You'll break her. You'll be beating her up soon. She'll come to heel after a couple of beatings. That's the only language women understand. And what d'you want me to do down here? What? It's too cold to sleep on the floor. There's room enough for both of us on the bed. You're right. And anyway I'm short of blankets. How about getting me a job with your team? You'll get rich. Ma, they're getting me my shoes tomorrow. If only I had let him go to that first division team. If only I knew... We have to be up at five. Don't oversleep. Lefteris will be waiting for us. I don't sleep any more, son. -Keep away from the fire. -Shan't. -Get up. Why don't you listen? -No. Don't make me hit you. I was struck by the fact that no one cared about Stratos. He was sleeping in the other room. Good morning. You're up too? There's no room. The road's bad and it's cold in the back of the truck. I already told you I don't mind. I'll stay here. We'll be back at ten. Get back to sleep. A little later I heard Manolis calling me. They'd found another solution. If we spot one, we'll cook him and we'll have a party tonight! Guys... How could I shoot? I'm frozen stiff here in the back. Why didn't you shoot? -Fucking hell and I was doing so well. -Come on now. It wasn't easy. -Think I got him? -We'll search later. -I didn't see anything. -Shut up or I'll belt you one. I'm sure you were praying it would get away. Jump in the back now and see how you like it. Fucking hell. It was the first time I shot a hare. -Not a word to anyone in the village. -Come on now, hunting hare isn't easy. He doesn't like losing ever. As a boy when he lost at soccer he cried. And when I win in cards, he is very silent. As we lay in wait I was for a while alone with Manolis. -What sort of trees are those? -Oaks. Oaks? Haven't you been up here before? We didn't come here to talk. Get down and don't make a sound. The rest of the day went by with no surprises. On the way back we stopped to shoot thrushes. Once when we stopped I asked him to let me fire. Drop it. We don't want to waste any cartridges. You went and got 6mm. You need 9mm or 10mm for thrushes. They were all he had and Lefteris took them. -What's that bird there? -My balls that's what. Go on, fire. It was best I keep away from him. A little later he bagged a quail and I went to get it. -It's gone. -Forget it. I'll go. He's hopeless. What have I got on my back? We didn't stop for coffee, as we had planned. It made me sad to think that I may never pass by there again. Go visit Roula. She's a good girl, studying in Athens. Don't be late tonight. It was Saint Demetrius' day. We went to the tavern for a beer and we must have drunk at least ten. -What shall I get her? -I have some bottles of liqueur. I know. I don't like it. Do you have a thousand on you? So what's going on with Roula? Nothing, if I wanted to I could have taken her before the army... but I respected her. And cut out the shit. Roula! Look who's here. We'll have some wine. Come over here. You had company and I didn't want to intrude. Why? What's your problem? -Don't we see each other? -Well, you don't need anyone. Why? Do you? You've got your house. You've got your sheep. So your father doesn't let you stay out late. But he'll die at some point. Cheer up. Do you remember what we went through in basic training? Here, have some wine. Bread, cheese and wine. all home-made. I began to feel comfortable. Soon I had begun to succumb to the charm of these people. He was a shepherd and so was Roula's father and Manolis'. -How about some real music? -Come on, let's dance. You're having a good time here. Alekos and Grigoris are waiting for us. Let them wait. Don't you have a good time? Screw them! I heard you missed a hare at five meters. -Where did you hear about it? -What d'you care? For the next hour the topic of conversation was the hare. -Where do you live? -In Kalithea. -I live in Pangrati. -Excuse me a moment. I tried to approach her but she kept her distance. I realized the family wanted to eat. Get off my back dammit. Mrs. Despina will tell me when it's time to go. -Right, Despina? -Right. Get the hell out of here and quit bugging me. Stop acting tough. I have to spell out a couple of things for you. Outside. Come on now, he doesn't mean you any harm. - Please tell me if I should leave. - Stay. We're going to eat. I'll just take my glass of wine and sit in the corner. I began to wonder whether I'd been wrong. I told you, I'm not hungry. Why are you drinking so much? What else can I do? I felt ill at ease and wanted to leave. But I didn't find the courage to do so. Get him out of here. It's almost one o'clock. I think it's time to go. Roula will make me some coffee and then we'll be off. Whatever Manolis wants. Coffee, anyone? -So, where are you now, Roula? -In Athens mostly. -And what are you studying? -Computer programming. I was told something that upset me once. Yes, I wanted to join the police force. I made an application. In the end I didn't get into the police academy. As we left he wanted to jump down from the porch, like when he was a kid. I was completely confused. Roula's contempt bothered me. My failure in surroundings which I considered familiar and accessible. Help me pull off my pants. How about a massage? My feet ache. The whole evening passed before my eyes in waves. I wanted them to turn out the lights... so that I could cry without being seen. I'm letting out the pigeons. Come and see. -What? -I'm letting out the pigeons. D'you know how high they fly? They disappear. We'll see. -You have a lot of pigeons? -They're mine. My mother can't stand the sight of them. They mess up the yard. You didn't show up yesterday. Manolis got tied up at Roula's. We had some trouble too. That jerk wouldn't let us in. Called the cops. We did get in finally. I teared up the paper saying "Don't enter". We ended up by getting really high. -Is Manolis still asleep? -We stayed very late. He did some really crazy things. He'll only calm down if you take him to Athens. -He's not happy here. -I'm afraid for him in Athens. I'll try and take him with me on the boat. I'm starting next week. Grigoris was the lover of Manolis' youth. He was in love with him. a love that was unconscious... conducted in the lawlessness in which they both existed. When I was a kid I cut off the cat's whiskers... just for the hell of it. Now, heaven help anyone who harms an animal. He's done for. Last year I had a whole zoo here. A hawk, goldfinches. I still have a hedgehog and turtles. How'll you get them down now? I'll let the others out, don't worry about it. I had a dog but it died. You've seen Alogoyannis' dog. I gave it to him. It was for Manolis. Grigoris was "accursed" in the village's harsh society. That's why he commits extreme acts. He runs off with a girl and becomes engaged to her. She leaves him in two months. In the village there is talk of impotence. That's why he drinks. He drinks in order to survive here. I don't get along with the people here. They're jerks. They mean no good. I only have three friends. Manolis, Alekos, Michalis. We fucked up once and now they spit on us. I saw the pigeons and said, "It's that jerk fooling around again." I have to leave in an hour and I'll miss the moto-cross. Get a load of that windbreaker! Where did you get it? It's real leather. How much did it cost? 20-25. Shall we go down? I tried to be pleasant with him. In vain. What have you been up to? Your lips are chapped. I don't care, you can do whatever you want. -Do you like her? -Women don't come near me, a jailbird. It's their loss. Really? Tell me, why did you ask for my I.D.? I've seen so many things in my life. Did she really ask for your I.D.? Once two priests came looking for him. One of them must have been quite important. And they kept asking. "Where's Manolis?" How should I know where Manolis is. Andreas says to me, "I'll bet they're cops in disguise." At noon manolis disappeared. He had some business to take care of he said. -Is there anything left to eat? -Didn't you eat at your in-laws? I just had a little chicken. I don't know, I can't eat there. It's too short for you. Lefteris is coming to have dinner with us tonight. You go to sleep. I'm going hunting. And then we'll go for coffee. -I'll be working two days this week. -Good. We need the money. I'm beginning to feel sorry for myself. What am I doing here? -What's the score in the Eolikos game? -A tie in Kavala. -Good! -Not good at all. -I struck out with my football pools. -What was your bet? But I wish it was just that. It's Manolis. He really goes all out. Manolis brought four birds and so did Lefteris. They would provide a tasty meal with bread and cheese. They sent Andreas off to fetch the grill and some bread. Then wine. Thank goodness. My sons in law are good. Andreas had accepted his fate. all he does is work. He has invested all his vitality in his children. When he takes them for a ride on his scooter, you can feel him flying. Who's the guy with the whistle? That's Nikos, the gym instructor. Do you know his surname, Manolis? Surnames are for the police. He has won some medals in the Balkan games. But he's a very nice guy. -I don't like him. -He's very relaxed. But I like him. -Is he from here? -Yes. The most interesting part of the population was not in the parade. All these youths with their tattoos and their pills. If I was the organizer I would have them parade naked. I'm thinking of going to play ball today. -Alight. -Thank you. I gave 3 hundreds to a junkie who was doing the rounds. Have you finished eating your pastry, kid? Let's go. Why don't you take him with you to Athens and find him a job? -Are you leaving tonight? -Tomorrow morning. Come again. Manolis is always happy to see you. And I had missed you. -I can't come before Christmas. -Come at Christmas. -It's Manolis' name day. -Mine too. -We'll have a party for both of you. -And we'll know for the trial. I'm off. Stratos, find a car for Christos. -Isn't there a seat for me? -Did you think we'd have a bus? -Why didn't you tell me? -We'll find something. It's okay. I just thought things were different. -No problem, I won't come. -Suit yourself. What are you wandering around for? What's up? -Nothing. -Don't go too far. We may find a car. Don't worry about it. Now what do you want? A punch in the mouth? Don't laugh. You're getting me all riled up! Why don't you let me find a way of escape? -What do you see from there? -The children playing and the turtle. Haven't you seen a turtle before? At two in the afternoon on October 28, 1987, no. Fuck off then! How could I leave? He had my money. I only had five hundred. It wasn't enough. Hey, a friend is coming up. Wait here, he'll bring you. And come closer, dammit! I've found a car. You'll go instead of me. The jerk. I felt an intense desire to leave for Athens. But I didn't want to give them the feeling that they had won. I'm all fucked up over this mix-up. Don't worry, we'll find something. -Hang on to it. -Do you have holes in your pockets? We leave our clothes behind. You never know. I wondered whether it was an indication that I should leave. On the soccer field he turned into a kind and innocent child. After the game was over he ran to celebrate with his mates. Get the shoes out of the bag. Everything needs washing, Ma. They must be expensive. They will also buy me a tracksuit. -Stratos, I may play in the A team. -Why not? Cut down on the smoking and the booze. Come on down. We're going to eat in the tavern. My poor aching feet. Will you give them a rub? I had saved it for Lefteris but he didn't come. It's the cream. You finally managed to come. -I'd tell you a thing or two but... -Now what am I supposed to do? -Nothing. -Come now, don't quarrel. How was Manolis to know there wouldn't be a car for you? The gist of it is that you don't care about anyone. The three of us ate in the tavern that evening. Manolis didn't say a word until we left. Why did you pay the bill? We'll pay for Stratos now? D'you know how much money he has? He doesn't give my mother a single penny. -What does he know about me? -Nothing. -And your friends? -Nothing. -Not even Michalis? -Not even Michalis. I told him to make a move on you. He asked me to find him a room. Really? Some people are getting too bold for their good. I need to talk with him. I spoke to him about his behavior the past few days. He listened to me with his head down. Why did you go with me? -That's different. -In what way? You know I love you. We're never going to part. We'll be like brothers. He kept insisting he was not a homosexual. He went with fags only for the money. -Hello Christos. -What's up? I just got in. The police came for a deposition. -What for? -For my gun and the uniform. -What happened to them? -How should I know? It's been two years since I was with my unit. He wouldn't have called if he wasn't in a tight squeeze. I prepared the deposition with the lawyer and sent it to him. I wanted to see if he'd call me as soon as he received it. -Hello. -Is Manolis Tsolakis there? Manolis? No. Do you want to talk to Stratos? Is he there? Let me speak to him. After ten days I couldn't stand it. I called the tavern in case he was there. Hello. Stratos told me you complained about me not calling. Don't get upset when I don't call. Remember I love you. Today we were having fun at Ilias' and I came back now. And when did you find the time to get drunk? -Grigoris is here too. -Let me speak to him. -He's shy. -Let me speak to him dammit. -Hey. -How're you doing? -Fine. We're sitting here drinking. -Are you alright? Yes, I'm fine. When are you coming down to Athens? Come on. Yes, we will. Here's Manolis. -What do you want? -Nothing. Ten days is a long time to hang about waiting for a phone call. -Were you really waiting? -Not for the whole 10 days. Once I went to a nightclub and once to the theatre. But I can't concentrate. But I feel as if I know what you're doing at any given time. -What did I do Thursday evening? -I don't mean that. I stayed home and watched TV. The next day he called again. I'm not well. I don't know what I want. I'm sick of all this routine. Come to Athens. But call me again when you're sober. Now what? Think I'm lying? No, but you never do the things you say when you're drunk. I'll be waiting. I'm thinking of putting in a few days' work first. So I can buy some clothes for Christmas. -Will you make it? -Otherwise, I'll come on Saturday. -Come at once. -And who'll pay me my daily wages? I think you should come. I can't speak to you now. I'll call you tomorrow to let you know if I'm coming. He didn't call, or the next day or the next. After two weeks I became obstinate. No, I was not going to play the part he wanted. Hello? This telephone call was completely unexpected. How're you doing? He had found a job in Athens for the winter. My old man's in hospital. It's serious. -Manolis must have told you. -When? Didn't he come to Athens? -Well, he hasn't been here. -Maybe he didn't come to Athens. He may have gone to Patras. He's been going down that way lately. Anyway, he's not at all well. I saw him the other day. He was tending sheep with a broken rifle. How are the others? Stratos, Yota? What a bitch. Did you know she doesn't sleep with Andreas? The other day he told me, "I haven't fucked in two months." -"She doesn't want to." -"Leave her, you jerk," I tell him. "And what about the children?" he says, "I have the children." -Think they're his? -Tell me... did Manolis have a fight with her boyfriend? Know who was her boyfriend? Manolis' boss. And not just him. I feel so sorry for Andreas. -Know what a great guy he is? -How's Stratos? He's fine. He's the best over there. I asked him why doesn't Manolis work with him. "No work," he tells me, "and anyway he'd quit." He's right. Michalis' presence took me back to the beginning... enchanted by the world I had seen for the first time... and which would never become mine. It's not only Manolis who draws me there, I told myself... knowing full well that things would be much more difficult. I was sure I didn't know him. I felt that they all knew me in there. Come on, let's go for coffee. -How're you doing? How's business? -Lousy. Money's real tight. It cost me 150.000 to get the fucking car repaired. I owe money, I don't have much work. I paid for the coffee. he pretended not to want to. But he took me up to the village. Stop at the corner. I wanted to get some pastries for Mrs. Kostoula. He found it absurd. -Come on now. -Stop. Manolis has really settled down. He works every day. Okay, he drinks and so what. He makes 1.000, 1.500. Spends 500, 700 on booze. What's it to him? Manolis must have gone hunting. -Any news of the court martial? -No. We'll have to wait until after the holidays. I asked him about his work. he said jobs were scarce. At least now I have time for the house in the vineyard. Want to go for a walk? He made me tell him the story about the hospital again. He interrupted me the whole time. I would have begun to suffocate if it wasn't for the wonder in his eyes. Therme must have been beautiful once. It's beautiful now too. But sometimes you don't know what to do. A new cafeteria opened today. This way one doesn't have to go to the spa every day. What? No hello? What are you doing here? I was just telling Manolis you'd forgotten us. -Have you seen him? -No. He must have gone hunting. He'll be back any time now. I haven't been feeling very well lately. Very often I can't stop my hands from shaking. It must be because I smoke too much. I rather think it's because we're getting old. How're you doing? While we smoked they tell me about Stratos. How he hasn't been working and how he gets up at noon. I've quit playing ball. That jerk got me all riled up. He only let me play as a substitute. He asked me literally in the last minute. I said I couldn't because I was in pain. I did them the favor but for the last time. I've still got the uniform and the shoes. Let them come get them. I wore myself out for them. He's really tired himself out. Even works on Sundays. Does any job that's going. Not like Stratos. You can't live with just one job. Why doesn't he do something else? Instead of acting high and mighty? I'm not telling him anything. We hang around together. I gave him money for a glass of wine the other day. Mother and son formed a united front against Stratos. Lefteris' sweater. Let's go see if I can get paid. And why shouldn't you get paid? Tonight I'd like us to go somewhere alone. Why? We have so much to talk about. -I'm all fucked up. -What's wrong? What can I tell you? Is this any kind of life. That's not an ass. That's a UFO. Put it on. -A gift for me? -No. -What have you brought me? -I decided not to bring you anything. Is that so? Well I got you a present. You shouldn't have. What present? So, Grigoris, what's the problem? Broads? Among other things. Better drop it. Well are we going in? Grigoris didn't come. We would meet at the disco, he said. -You've brought the camera. -Yes, how did you know? You went through my bag. -You shouldn't have done it. -Why? I wanted to see if you had brought Lefteris' sweater. I told my mother, "You'll see, he's brought it." -And you pretended you didn't know. -I don't want you to upset yourself. -I've brought you a present. I forgot. -What? A little hash. Don't ask how I got my hands on it. I said to myself, "He'll enjoy it and it's not bad for him like..." I told you. I'm through with the pills. 1, 2, 3... 4, 5, 6, 7... -And 8. How much do we owe him? -Eight. -Okay. Goodnight then. -Where are you going? -26 days to civvy street. -Yes, man. Feels like eternity. I'll see you later. Done. -Come. You'll hold the door. -Get up and do a little dancing. I'll be back in five minutes. What were they doing in there? It seemed like ages. What about me? Don't I get a scarf? -Why did you give it to him? -He liked it. Are you glad I came? If I gave you a couple of punches and you'd come running! If you gave me a couple of punches I may do the same. Get it well into your head. I'm never coming here again. Forget what you've been used to with your gigolo friends. -At least with me. -You don't say. Seriously? Manolis' words Floated in the air. A present for your name day. Shall we go? Was it the image of me that he gave his friends that was crumbling? Or he didn't like my attitude? Let me have a couple of pills to pay for the gin. Leave him alone. He'll get over it. They're for the bartender. -What's this shit? -Where's the scarf? -Give it to Grigoris. -I'm not giving it to anyone. -Not even to me? -Not even to you. I thought they had gone to dance. -Have you seen Manolis? -No. -Are you okay? -Fine. Where were you? I was looking all over for you. Really? I was right here. Go get the drinks. We're going on to the "Havaneza" afterwards, right? Alekos' high spirits won me over. The "Havaneza" was a night-club just outside the village. That broad dances to anything, even the news. She's here every night and she always starts the dance. So, will you give me your tie? -Why? -Because I fancy it. My song, my song! That's what she did all night with each new song. Manolis went up to ask for his special request. Will you take me home? Who's she? He's flipped out. -Shall I give the joint to the kid? -Go ahead. I'll be back. That's the way I want to die. When drunk, we don't know what we say. Alekos will take you home. We're taking the kids back. Go away my good man. I don't have any money. Impossible. You know that I have helped you but I need the money. I've got kids too. That night I fell asleep immediately. I didn't even hear Manolis. Take it, but you've left me penniless and it is Christmas. I'm sorry but I've got my family to think of too. -I have two kids. -Anyway, goodbye. Get me the card to complete it. -When is Alexandra's wedding? -Now they say at Easter. They're expecting an uncle of Lefteris from Australia. You will come to the wedding? I'll be so relieved when that's over. She began to tell me various stories about her son. Stories she had told me before. God only knows how I managed to get the girl away from them. I went to Athens and got her. It was Yota, who had got mixed up with the Yokaris brothers. They were the ones who ruined Manolis. I was never to find out what was the brothers' hidden secret. Shall we sing some carols? Go away, we've already heard them. -Aren't you working? -He didn't go to work today. Though I told him Panagiotis was waiting. It's Christmas. I'm taking it easy. Isn't that right, Christos? Don't tell me, I'm already on leave. Today we'll relax and tomorrow we'll get drunk. Got anything to eat? I'm thinking of going down to the spa. Get us some shortbread. Get me half a kilo too. You know how much I like shortbread. I can eat tons of them. Come and I'll buy you an orange drink. Are we drinking orange juice now? How did you sleep? He didn't say a word. I told him of the side effects of pills. I don't take them anymore. I stopped. My teeth were falling out. Christos, come closer. He's better than his "mother." His "mother" was Manolis' new fianc√©e. -Are you planning to marry her? -If she gives me half her property. -Things have progressed I see. -Her son loves me. We're old friends. One day she tells me... "Do you want me for a sister-in-law?" "I want you," I tell her... "but Manolis is young enough to be your son." Don't listen to her, Manolis. She's got lots of money. Alogoyannis had arranged the match. And you should see her in the nude. I've seen her. I've often gone to her house and she'd be dressing. Her belly is a mess. -It doesn't seem to bother him. -Has he seen it? They' re just friends. Has he told you he's been with her? I don't think so. Manolis went hunting and I went to take photographs of Thodoros. -'Morning. -'Morning. -You from these parts? -No. -Are you staying here? -Yes. -Where are you from? -From Athens. -Where are you staying here? -What's it to you? No, nothing, you don't have to tell me. -Know Stratos Tsolakis? -No. I'm staying with him. -Has anything happened? -Nothing, son. -He never listens to me. -Shut up. We're being heard. While I was away Yota and Andreas had had a fight... because he hadn't paid me for the shortbread. -Did he take the kids with him? -He took them for a ride. They'll all be killed on that scooter. In her rage Yota will remember her relationship with Giorgos... the soldier who was killed. I was the one who ran after him... followed him to Samos. He used to beat me but I liked it. He was jealous of me too. I knew he went with other women but I didn't care. And the more I wasn't jealous the more furious be became. Alexandra doesn't let Lefteris stir a step. If I knew he beat her, I would have taken her away. She's a good girl and I love her. I had begun to like this girl who was slowly sinking into inertia. He would tell me... "Yota, she'll be the death of me." He had become involved with a divorc√©e... over forty she was. She got him the motorbike on which he was killed. He would have married her. But I loved him even more. Until he was killed. -And they married me off to this jerk. -Shut up! He's the one who feeds you. I couldn't bring her back to her senses. She would sit in a corner and not say a word. "Mrs. Kostoula," the doctor told me, "she's in a bad way." A year later Thodoros Yokaris was killed too. Thodoros and Giorgos were best friends. They were the ones who had turned Yota into a hooker. He's probably gone home to get himself something to eat. If he messes up my kitchen heaven help him! What d'you want? Manolis is not here. I'd like to say something to Christos. Grigoris was uneasy. The police had picked up Pantelis. -Did you give him anything? -Not me. Manolis. Is he crazy? He'll spread the word to the entire village. -Where is he now? -He went to milk Alogoyannis' sheep. And then he would go hunting. D'you think that's the reason. I had begun to be alarmed. "Could it be?" I asked myself. -Was only Pantelis picked up? -Yes. He'll get us into trouble. Grigoris? -Did he make a run for it? -I don't know. He came to warn me. My feelings of guilt had woken up inside me. I thought that everyone was looking at me behind the closed shutters. -Does my mother know anything? -No. -What have you done! -Take it easy. What happened? You won't bring the police in here again. Do you hear me? -Have you all gone mad in here? -Kostoula? -Get out of here! Get out! -Did you hear it? -Get your things and go. -Want me to belt you one? -Don't! -Kostoula! -Is anything wrong? -Nothing, nothing. Keep it down, we're being heard. Why are you going on at me? Do what you want, but harm no one. -What's he talking about? -The girl you raped last night. -What are you saying? -That's what the police believe. They found her in a bad state outside the village. Are you all paranoid or what? Let's go before I blow up. Things were serious. But I was unable to hide my relief. Nothing happened. My cousin came to take her to his house. She started acting up. -Like she was high. -But she was high! Anyway. She got us all riled up. In the end we left her where they dump the garbage. In the garbage? Where they dump it. 3-4 kilometres from the village. You left her in the middle of the night? We should have all had her. But I had my court martial to think about. Go inside. I'll try and find Grigoris. And don't worry. It's nothing. Don't trust him. Manolis is full of lies. We've been listening to that for three years. Take him with you to Athens and find him a nice girl. Whoever marries him will live like a queen. What will he do with him in Athens? What am I listening to this shit? Listen to me, son. Manolis loves to work. Take him with you. I felt trapped. And saddened at the thought of such a prospect. What's the matter? I'm leaving. I thought about it. I can't take it anymore. I can't. The same thing all over again. I saw that he hesitated to speak. For him I was always Manolis' friend. I've got some self-respect. I want to be able and talk, without feeling ashamed. I'm getting out. Tell them. -Me? -Mark my words. They'll spoil it for Alexandra. Why don't you wait until after the holidays? I'm leaving. I'll sleep at the pub tonight. And tomorrow I'll open up the house. I'll live there and paint it during the day. -Do you have blankets? -I'll find some. You can come whenever you can. I left him in his world. But his proposition haunted me, when I got my ticket for Athens. -How about some coffee? -I've drunk too much already. -Where's Manolis? -He's sleeping. Has he got anything for tonight? Pantelis took the last joint. -How is he doing? -They've let him go. But her mother is pressing charges. He's got nothing? When are you coming back? When are you leaving? -Tomorrow. First thing. -Already? Let's go and I'll buy you a drink. I didn't go. I returned home to find Manolis. He had woken up and left. People are spiteful. They've been bad-mouthing us... to Lefteris' family ever since the engagement. And now this. Don't worry about it. I told you nothing happened. Manolis told me as well, but I don't trust him. And just when they were getting fond of him. Damn him! Why not? He's a good boy. Anyway, they're coming tonight. They are really nice people. They're so fond of Alexandra! -Where were you? -At the spa. -Did you find Grigoris? -Yes. -What d'you want him for? -I'm going to lie down. He had drunk wine and his head ached. -What did Grigoris tell you? -He didn't tell me. I told him. They didn't touch her I tell you. Just fooled around with her and left her. She's sick, poor thing. Her folks let her do as she likes... You should see the things she used to do. -Where's Stratos? -He didn't come home tonight. Give me a cigarette. Get down. I wondered whether I should tell them of Stratos' plans. I felt that I had no right. Yet... I hope he doesn't come now I'm smoking. I don't know. I feel ashamed in front of Stratos. He told me he wasn't coming. He's staying at his house. For Christmas? -Forever. -And who'll cook, do his washing? If his shirt isn't ironed he yells at my mother. Don't tell Manolis and get him all riled up. And there's the property. That's his too. -Where's Andreas? -Drinking somewhere. -How did you get here? -Kyriakos dropped us off. Only the three of us sat at the Christmas table. Missing were Manolis who was sleeping... Andreas who always gets drunk during the holidays and Stratos... who is getting ready to leave the village. The in-laws are coming tonight. Don't worry, I'm leaving. I'm going visiting. And Andreas? Will you babysit for me? Don't come back before ten. I admired the secret understanding between the two women. Andreas shouldn't have done that to me. It's been four years since I've been home for Christmas. And where is Stratos? I'm off to milk Alogoyannis' ewes. He's dead drunk. Wait for me here. Have some coffee. He was with Alogoyannis all night. It was obvious that he no longer wanted us to be seen together. Anyhow he shouldn't have said it, Christos. Our girl just got engaged. Stratos knows how to carry on a conversation. Don't worry. He'll cool off and he'll be back. Yes. It's not easy living alone. He came back two hours later dead drunk. -Where's your mother, kid? -With Uncle Kyriakos. -Where did you say? -Leave the child alone. Go and wash. We're expecting company. Michalis was right. Yota slept with Manolis' boss. And everyone in the house knew it. He hasn't shown up yet. I saw her for the first time at a loss... faced with all the impasses. He picked the day. He'll come, don't worry. I don't think he's gonna push it. He was upset. He's not going to break up my family. -Where's she gone to? -To find Stratos I imagine. -What for? -How should I know? Silly woman. Where are you going? For one more time I felt left out of the events. Now I had remained alone to welcome the in-laws. -We're going home. -Can you drive? I would find an excuse, something... that Yota's child got sick and that Stratos had taken it to hospital. -Andreas took the children. -I know. -Did you find him? -Stratos? He's in the square. Go on, get out of here! Shut up. Go and keep him company, son. He's been drinking and doesn't know what he's saying. -Like this or with my things? -Anyway you want and stop bugging me. Don't pay any attention to him son. As soon as the holidays are over I'll send him in Athens. His nerves are shattered too. When we go to the village we'll go hunting. -Never. -Why? I'll do the shooting. That's exactly why. I may fire a shot at you too and end it all. If it does you any good. And where would I find such a friend?
