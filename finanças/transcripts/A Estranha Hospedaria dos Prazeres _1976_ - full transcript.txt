Power of the powers... the kingdom of the time... turn the ashes of nothing... into everything. Live to die... or die to live? Is there a correct answer? No! Only doubts. Only deductions. Only the certainty of the emptiness. Loneliness is desperately searching for... everything or nothing, the wideness of the gloom. For the answer for this riddle... would be the end of the mystery... the end of eternity's secret... the apogee of happiness... before an accomplished mission... because man would be face to face... with his best conquest... the awakening of the origin itself. Asking the size of the universe... is the same as asking... what is the end of eternity... or what is the real form of God. How many stars? How many planets? How many galaxies are there in the universe? These are questions with no answers... familiar with an inferior dimension. Why that? Why don't you accept the extinction? Why fear? Why the emptiness of your presence... if you are superior? What happens when the deadly mantle falls down on you? Only your imagination can tell. It's the end. It's the beginning. Nothing. Everything. Yes. You are afraid of the materialism. You are afraid of yourself. Contemplate the cosmos. Let a mental fantasy flow. The illusion of the illusions... searching for a real truth... a glade in the darkness. It's the magic of the light that blunts. They're breezes from the breath of life... that caress your bosom. The unrestricted joy that involves your mind. It's a word that, like in repeat mode, repeats... and repeats, but it doesn't say the magnitude of its meaning. The light of existence. The disguise of death is the awakening of life. RECEPTIONIST AND CHAMBERMAID REQUIRED IN A INN GOOD SALARY NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED GO TO ESTRADA DA REDENÇÃO KM 17 I'm sick and tired of waiting. Let's see who's lucky. - Has anyone talked to you? - We're waiting... I'm also in this line for a long time. - Is the salary really good? - If it's as announced it's ok. - I think someone is coming. - Me too. You and you. The rest is dismissed. But the ad asks for 3 women. The other 2 have already been recommended. I need a job. I do whatever you want. Maybe the next time. At the right time, I give you news. - I've decided not to stay. - I don't want this job too. You are right. It is not the right time. Come back later. I will be waiting for you. At the right time, the right things. What is written, not even the time can erase. Welcome to my home. The task begins now. Host your colleagues. Is the job already ours? Yes. - You were recommended. - But this far? Will be any guest coming? For those who look for peace there isn't a way... that will not be found. There are limited vacancy and they're all reserved. You can start your job. The guests want to rest. Welcome. You're already registered. Your room is the number 17. The gambling table has already been provided. THERE ARE ROOMS It doesn't seem good, but anyway... Welcome. I was waiting for you. Don't you need our IDs to check in? Do not worry about that. It is all right. Show them their room. Hey, man. - What a rainstorm! - It really is. - Excuse me, is there any room? - Talk to my boss. The reservation is already done. Room 15. - What a strange place. - It's my first time here. Excuse me, may I ask you a question? Leo, I love you so much. My dear. No, I don't want to know. It's your problem. - You solve it. - But I can't. There's no way. - It's too visible. - I've already said. It's your problem. I was... waiting... for you. I have a special room for everyone. - Room 13. - It's my lucky number, buddy. Rest in peace. Cool. I don't have money. I can't ask my husband... or else he will discover. Don't you understand? It's your problem. Let's make love in the wardrobe. Give me this bottle. Who brought it? Come on, give me the bottle. Hey, buddy, give me this bottle. The last thing I remember is the sign on the road... - Danger: no trespass. - Cool. Crazy. I'm high. I don't even know how we came here. You're crazy. Hey, man. I hadn't seen you. I thought you were dead. Give me a break, are you crazy? Welcome to my inn. Unfortunately... four of you cannot stay. Go. God! Sorry, but this house scares me. Don't hesitate. What should be done... is already done. Go. THERE ARE ROOMS There is no room. Maybe some other time. - Mister, it's raining. - Would you like some coffee? Our services are only for guests. Good night. Don't worry, my dear. We will make it. Emotions do not make any sense. How important is an object? How important is a living creature... if the true reason for being is the eternal existence? - Is there any room for us? - Talk to my boss. There will always be a room for those who volunteered... or did not volunteer to be indicated to my house. I hope we are in a safe place. Don't worry. The important is to make a bankruptcy. The company is almost in the share market. I heard that the poor guy is gambling all his savings. He hopes to make extra money... to save his hospitalized wife. - I love you. - Me too. Great! Everybody naked, great! Everybody naked, great! Everybody naked, great! Let's go! Everybody naked, great! Everybody naked, great! Everybody naked, great! Everybody naked, great! Everybody naked, great! Get this. Everybody naked. Everybody naked, great! Everybody naked, great! Let's do it. Let's go. Great! Great! Great! Everybody naked, great! Everybody naked, great! Great! Great! We won't have rivals anymore, thanks to our informer. I hope you understand my situation. I can't and I mustn't show up at Satan. Don't worry about it. You'll have a great reward. Well, to the plans. - Paid. - Let's double. - Bad luck today, isn't it? - That's it. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and mine. Enough. I can't do it anymore. I've lost too much. No, please. Don't leave now. I've lost too much, too. To prove you I have a good heart, I'm staying. This way you get your money back, ok? Everybody naked, great! Everybody naked, great! Everybody naked, great! Everybody naked, great! Great, great! Come up here. Good. Everybody naked, great! Everybody naked, great! Let's see, let's see who shakes better. Let's go! - We don't have any room. - It's not what the sign says. Gentleman, this place goes according to my wishes. Please, I ask you to leave. Maybe you don't know me. I'll pay your price. I can't go on with this rain. This problem is only yours. Sorry, I'm sorry. Take good care of our guest. It's not over. I'll make some arrangements. There is no redemption for those... who want to be blinder than the blind one... having his sight to see. Be our guest. Everybody naked, great! Everybody naked, great! Well, let's go to the signatures. Sign here, please. All right. - There. - Right. - Here too? - One minute. - Here, here and here. - Right. - Everything all right? - Exactly. - Great. - Here too. Just sign. - Very good. - Sign. Finally. You know what you want. When I had money you kept on giving me false hopes. Who is she? What does she want? Calm down, Olga. Put the gun down. I love you and you know that. - I know. - You bastard. Where am I? Some acts should not be repeated. What is done, done is. Don't try to get rid of things that are no longer yours. Don't come back. Go away now. Where am I? God, where am I? You're where your name doesn't need to be said anymore... for what you were looking for is already found. Interesting. They're all showing the same time. Exactly 5 minutes after the robbery in the jewelry. What a storm. I'm going. It's three in the morning. My watch broke at 3:30. Mine too. But at 4. Funny. Funny. We're playing for so long and it's the same time. It seems like the time stopped. What time is it? One o'clock. - What happened? - The light. - Which light? - The light. The light. - The light. - Miriam. The light. The light. The light. The light. The light. The light. The light. The light. The light. The light. Miriam! Sorry. Let your will be respected. This day shall not be repeated. Miriam! Miriam. Miriam! Why? Why? Why, gosh? It can't be true. Why? Why? It's wrong to search for happiness... if you don't know what happiness is. Everybody who exists has the right to know. The time of truth has arrived. The man... has the right to forgive his similar's mistakes... but never his own mistake. The one who searches for the beginning of the end... will find an end... with no beginning. Better the dung of life than life in a worm... a worm that cannot die because it does not exist. And this clock? Why doesn't it give the time? There is no punishment worse than time. Give time to the time itself... and fear its arrival. After all, who are you? Do not wake up the beast who lives in me. Let my rest be its extinction. The inn is here. But this is a cemetery. That's not possible. Maybe the crash did it to you. Maybe. THE END
