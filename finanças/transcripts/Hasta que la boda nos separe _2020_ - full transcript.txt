That's not why you're leaving. Look, you made me a really nice offer. And a few months ago, no problem. But now everything is different, and you've changed that. And you can't change back. I want more. I know about wanting more. I invented the concept. The question is how much more. I want the fairy tale. Impossible relationships. My special gift is impossible relationships. I'm sorry I ever met... I'm sorry I ever got into your stupid car! As if you had... What are you watching? Pretty Woman. Mummy says you're leaving because you slept with the neighbour's daughter. No, look... Mummy is angry right now. And from now on she'll be saying some bad things about me to make you hate me. Yes. But... The real reason why I'm leaving is all this crap they sell in films about everlasting love and happy-ever-afters. It's all lies, sweetie. I'm telling you this because I don't want you to end up like me trapped in some sad, meaningless life. I want you to promise me that you won't let them trick you and to live life as it's meant to be lived with no obligations, no commitment. Because in the end... Everything goes wrong. You promise? That's my girl. So... You didn't sleep with the neighbour's daughter? Well, actually I did. It's true, I slept with her. Several times! Your Daddy's an absolute legend! I love you, sweetie. By the way, Pretty Woman is a whore. THE WEDDING UNPLANNER OK, checking, the crying grandmothers with depression seated in second row with clinex and orfidal. Don't ask about the page boy, it's the best we've found. The priest is checked and no background, I have checked his record. OK. How is the groom? With the same stunned face, there's nothing to be done. It's what we have. Everyone it's in position. Bride, check? Bride entering in carriage in 3, 2... - What the fuck. - What's happening? That the bride is beautiful, Marina. What if my mother is right? I'm over the hill. Irene, now's really not the time. Bride entering in carriage in 53, 52... - 51... - And... The music, Mum? - 45,44... - Mum? - 40, 39... - Excuse me. - Mum! - I fell asleep. - Jesus Christ! - No, no! Not yet! Sorry, not yet, false alarm. Stay seated for now. What a mess, what a mess. - Alright, alright. - No, no, sweetie! And you wanted to stay at home? That's some water! Don't worry, it's fine. I'll put it out. It's all good! Oh my God. Stay calm! A fire... Sorry! OK. And it's out! We can carry on, it's OK. She's so fast. - Bride in 6, 5... - Here you go. - 4, 3... - Now play. - Marina, is everything alright? - Now, now! Bride entering. They're so in love. Why do you think I'm in this business? When people are in love, I get paid. As romantic as ever. I could just take her right out of there and swap places. How long's it been? - Since your last shag. - Not that long... - I don't know. - You need a nice dick in your face. That's really sexist. - Yeah? - Come on. Seriously, you should liberate yourself. I am liberated. - Alright. See the waiter over there? - Which one? - That one. He been checking you out. - Me? Go over and say "hey, cutie, where do you come from? Come to the bathroom, I want to show you my pina colada. - Marina, we're working. - Make me a cocktail. He's right there, for God's sake! Is that my Mum? - Yeah, meet me in the bathroom. - Excuse me? In the bathroom? Copy that. Excuse me. - Congrat... - Excuse me. She has to control everything... The bride wants this, the groom wants that... And what about what I want? Nobody cares. - Am I invisible, or...? - Hey, Mum. - Hi, sweetie. - Having a little drink, are we? - No. - Yes you are. - What's this then? - Tonic. Tonic, yeah? Let me taste. Alfredo! I told you no alcohol. You trying to get me drunk? Did I hire you to help me out or to drink the place dry? See what I mean? Hello. - Sir. - His name is Manolo. Manolo. Can you hear me? - His hand is, um... Very cold. - Manolo! - Turn down the air conditioning! - Excuse me. Sir... Eh, Mum... I think this man is dead. Makes sense, for a man he was too good a listener. - What did you do to him? - Nothing, conversation... Irene, emergency at the bar. Manolo. Manolo, come on now. - Goodnight. - But there's a group of girls taking shots, asking me when I'm planning on getting married. They'd hook up with any old idiot. And who's that gonna be? And that's why I'm out. - Shit, are you serious? - Yep. No, Carlos, please. He gave it to me... Manolo. Let's see... Manolo. Shit. It's my cousin Manolo, he came from Albacete. - He might not be going back there. - Mum. We should probably let people know, send everyone home... No, no, nobody's going home. We're not cancelling the wedding. Manolo's an asshole. Anyway, he was 90 years old. - He told me 60. - Really? Well there you go. He's always been a pain in the ass. You think I'm going to ruin my daughter's day for this? One moment, please. Alright. Wake up, you old fart! - What the hell are you doing? - Just an idea, shit, it was worth a try! - You know how much I've paid for all this. - A lot. My daughter can't be asking me for another wedding because I can only afford one. So I'm counting on you to sort this out. How am I supposed to hide a body before the wedding's even over? You'll think of something. You're the wedding planner. Of course. Leave me alone. - Can't you stay another half hour? - I'm leaving. - It's been a crazy week. - All the more reason for a crazy night! - That's all I ask. - I mean it. - The groom's cousin was giving me the eye. - Act casual. - Groom's cousin, six o'clock. - Where? - Six o'clock. - Should I look over? OK. Hey! What's wrong with you? - Carlos, don't be an asshole. - Sorry mate, I'm going. Ambulance, please. A discreet ambulance. I don't know, tell them no sirens. Don't make a big deal of it. I know he's dead, but we're not going to ruin the whole... - What? - The bride. Shit, it's the bride. - Hello. - I was looking for you. Come on, man. You always do this. OK, have a great time. No. No! - Hello, hello. - What? I was obviously talking to him. Hello, hello? Can you hear me? - He's dead... - Sir? Hello? He's dead, he's dead... - I'm going to call an ambulance. - Like hell you are! You wanna go to jail? For a homicide we're talking 1-4 years. Look, it's fine. The car is fine, he's not injured. We can just put him in a room. It'll look like he passed out from the rum and heart medicine. I've seen CSI. - You've seen it before. - Oh, yeah! - And how does it always end? - I don't think they catch them. - They always catch them. - I saw it in season 4, don't worry. Hide the body, give him loads of rum and I'll keep watch, OK? - Hey, you're walking away. - No I'm not. - You're slowly walking away. - Slowly, yes, but just to get perspective. - Don't leave me with a dead body, please. - Just breathe. One... Two. I'm out of here. - Well, this is unfortunate. - OK, let's not panic. - Something's happened, we've lost the body. - Maybe someone took him, I don't know... - We have to do something. - I totally agree. Maybe he was never dead. - It was just a little dancing... - Lourdes! - OK, OK, let's go. - Lourdes. - Right, let's go. - Slow down, I'm all dizzy! Have you seen anything? Any news? - Excuse me, which way to the rooms? - Down the hall. Grandpa's had a little too much to drink. He's a tad... Hey, hey! What are you doing? - Nothing, nothing. - What are you doing? - It's my grandfather. He's a bit drunk. - No he's not. - He's not drunk. - I hit him with the car, I'm sorry. No, he was already dead. We found him like that. - Be quiet, we have to get him out of here. - He was already dead? This way. - I'm Carlos. - That's great, come on! Nice to meet you! Where are we going? Goodnight. I'm so sorry. - For what, my cousin? - Yes. Ah, I couldn't give a shit about my cousin. I wanted to thank you for everything. Really, you did a great job. - Thank you so much. - It was perfect. - OK, see you later. Have fun. - Same to you. - Sorry for your loss. - No worries. Thank you for lending a hand. No worries, it was "dead" easy. Sorry, that wasn't funny. Let me buy you a drink. - I was actually leaving. - No, you're not. Come on. It's easy, really. All you need is a nice venue, a good menu and a good band for the party, and that's it. You've convinced me. If I get married, I'll hire you. Actually, good idea. It'd be great if I could close the year with another wedding. - No. No. - Were you thinking traditional, or... It was a joke. I was joking too, I wasn't... What a shame. Two shots, please? Thanks. So, this never ends. People keep getting married... - Luckily, people keep getting married. - This is... - Are you married? - No I'm not... I mean... Marriage is my business, I plan weddings, but I don't... - You don't practice it? - I don't, no. Clearly. - I don't really believe in marriage. - Me neither, to be honest. Is that an awful thing to say? With me being a wedding planner? - No, no. - Anyway, I just think... - Oh, I love this song! Let's dance, Mario. - Carlos. - Carlos, whatever. - I really better be going... Yeah, yeah, you have to go. I get it. Fuck! - Are you OK? - Yes, why? - You said "fuck". - Never mind, just don't stop. Don't stop, Mario! - My name is Carlos. - Whatever. - Was it good? - Yeah. Oh, my taxi! - Your taxi? - Yes, my taxi is there, sorry. How did you call the taxi? Well, I'm pretty good at time management. Alright. Sorry. I had a great time. - Me... Me too. - Coming! Actually, wait. I'll give you... ...my card. It's got my name, my e-mail, everything... - "All yours"? - Yes, it's the name of my agency. - So... - So... Ciao. - Nice meeting you. - Likewise. Have a good night. My god... Hey, honey... Good morning. How was the wedding? It was good. Yeah, good... - I'm sorry I couldn't go. I felt so sick. - Don't worry, sweetie. You know what Ben's like. He loves all of that stuff. I'm going to put on a wash, OK? - OK. - I'll take this. Oh my God. Alright, this... What's this? Who's Marina? Carlos? It was in your pocket. Oh, my voice is all... What did you say? You really don't know who this belongs to? Well... It was a wedding, these things happen. "All yours". Carlos. Where did Ben take you? - That card has an explanation and... - Well, what is it, then? Because Marina's card from "All Yours" is in in your pocket and you don't know why? Ah, she's a wedding planner. So, what? We're getting married? Yes. - Yes? We're getting married? - No. Yes or no? Surprise. But... You could have asked. Oh, about getting married? Um, should we get married? - No, not like that. - Yeah, I'm a bit nervous. Will you marry me? Yes, of course! Yes! - I wasn't expecting it! - Me neither. Thanks for reminding us we owe money when we're broke as shit. - Ben. - What? I keep thinking about what Alexia will say when I tell her. Let's talk about that later. First, I have a question. What's wrong with you? You can't tell her. Are you crazy? How could I not tell her? I've never cheated on her before. So what? Honesty is great and all, but if it's just going to bring you grief then what's the point? You'll get over this guilt eventually. We need to be at the church in half an hour. Don't worry, we'll be there. How are you, how was last night? Nice time with the waiter? Did you rub your face on his dick until... - Marina, my nephew's here! - Hi, sweetie! - Go play with your transformers outside. - OK. Great! Know how many guys cheat on their wives? 72.3% of the population. 68.8% go through the same thing, keep it to themselves and they're happy! That's from Boston University. Google's not always right, come on. This is just who I am. When I met Marina, something special happened. Did you clean the scene of the crime? - OK, and the espadrilles? - They'll bring them. I think that's it. Hello? Hi Marina, it's Carlos. Who? Mario? - Hello, Mario. - Hello... Um... How are you? Yeah, good. I just have something important to tell you... Mario, sorry, it's not a great time. Can I call you later? OK, but don't forget to call, pl... OK, talk soon, bye! - Jesus. - Who was it? Some guy I fucked at the wedding... What? And you gave him your phone number? Seriously? I gave him our card, he must have gotten confused... - Will you see him again? - Irene, it was just sex. - And how was it? - Good. Normal, you know... - Like... - Bing bang. - Well there you go. - Get the guestlist, OK? - Here it is. - We're expected at 12:45. At 14 I want the photographer with the bride and the groom. Smile. Photo! Keep the parents away from me for an hour. I don't like them lurking. Sir, there's a bit of a problem with the tables. We're missing some names. Please go on through. Problem solved. Please, Irene, take a look at my mum. Guests arriving. All OK. You need to be cheerful, lively and angelical. Miss a note and you're out the fucking door, OK? Alright. 1, 2, 3... Stop. Honey. You're out of tune. Get out. And 1, 2, 3... Cheers for the newlyweds! Cheers! OK, Mum, music in 3, 2, 1... - Oh, no. - Sorry. What are you doing? That bloody page boy. There. Problem solved! - My God. - Don't worry, it was just a little trip. Up you get. - Alright, alright. - We've reached a million hits on YouTube. Marina, we've had 4 cancellations. The father of the bride won't pay. - Because of your mother! - It was an industrial accident. "Industrial accident". You were drunk, Lourdes! I wasn't drunk and stop shouting, I have a hangover. Got a pill? I want her gone! Well, I'm not so keen on your retarded nephew either, but he's here every day. My nephew is not retarded. He's ten and believes in the tooth fairy. The tooth fairy isn't real? - Not retarded. Just deluded. - Of course she does, go wait for your Dad outside. Go outside as well to think about what you've done. On you go. Alright, kid, let's go have a good think. OK, no need to get upset. - I'll sort something out, and... - You better. - Shit. - What? Has he fallen for me? Marina? Hi. Hi. Sorry, Marina, I fucked up, I... Don't worry, Carlos, I mean... You are being a bit invasive, but... You remembered my name. - OK, so... - Hello. Alexia? Yes? Eh... Yes? It's that... Eh... I'm Marina. Marina? You know each other? Well, yes, from... ...from primary school, from way back! You've arranged for our wedding to be planned by my childhood friend. - Wedding? - Friend? Yeah, she found out about the surprise, and... Well, hi! - How are you? - I'm good. - It's been ages! How are you? - Look at you! Yeah, I've changed, thank God. You're so pretty! - I know everything. - Really? - Yes, Carlos told me... - Not everything, um... She, well she found the card, and... This is Irene, my business partner. This is Alexia, an old childhood friend. - And this is Carlos. - A pleasure. I'm Carlos. - Carlos... - Carlos?! - You didn't tell me about this. - Well, I had no idea. And I'm sure she doesn't either, so... - Lots of secrets being kept here! - Yeah, because it was a surprise! So, yesterday he really insisted on me giving him our card and then she found it. There's no fooling this one! True. - Why don't we go take a seat inside? - Yes, perfect. - After you. - OK! Have a seat. Can I get you anything? No, that's alright. - Marina, how nice to see you! - Likewise. I had no idea you were a wedding planner, and with your own company. - Our company. - Yes, it's ours. I knew the teachers were wrong about you not achieving anything in life. - Which teacher said that? - It doesn't matter. What matters is that you've doing amazing! Yeah, like a bullet in the neck. - That's great. - So, Carlos. Carlos, Carlos. I've got some bad news for you. OK? - No. - Yes. The thing is... I've been thinking it over all morning, and, well... we've got such a busy schedule right now that - we won't be able to plan your wedding. - Oh, no... - What? - I feel awful. - I understand, we don't want to... - Of course we'll organise your wedding. - Of course. - Irene, I've been looking at the agenda. It's very tight. I know, but you'll do everything you can to slot them in, right? Of course. We'll do it. - Wow! - It's our pleasure. Oh, honey, this is great! So, um... Where do we begin? We pick a date, first of all. I was thinking of next month. I'll go get the diary. - It's a bit early. - If it's love, why wait? I thought we could get married in Tenerife, just like my parents. We should make the most of the season. It's all planned out... First we have to choose the three main components. Your dream venue, a great band, and a delicious menu. - Your dream wedding. - Oh, yes. - I have an idea! - Another? Because we're short of time - come spend a few days with us in Tenerife. - Well, now! - and we can make some of these decisions. - Exactly! - Excuse me? - My Dad has a house there, you could stay, more practical, right? - Not a bad idea, eh? - Um... Right. - In Tenerife? - In Tenerife. In Tenerife. Of the 25 little assholes in my class, it had to be Alexia. Was she at your school? I don't remember her. - Did you ever come to my school? - Why bother? You still hold a grudge? Well, a grudge... "Grudge" isn't the right word. Right. Children of Sat... I mean, children of God. Give me three facts about amphibians. Yes, Alexia? They are born from eggs, the tadpoles live in water, the adults on land. Very good, thank you. Marina! Give me three facts about mammals. Well, they... They have a lot of fur... So you're a mammal, then! Marina the gorilla, Marina the gorilla! Marina the gorilla. I don't get it. - All the body hair. - Peach fuzz. - Fuzz that wouldn't stop growing. - Peach fuzz, Mum. - Yeah, body hair. - I don't think I'm going to go. - What? - Yeah, I'd rather stay here. Marina, everyone has cancelled on us. We've only got Ernesto and Paul. Exactly, I can't leave all this work behind! Well, me and your Mum can hold the fort. - You don't get on. - That was before. - We get along great now. - Yes, just fine. How's that genius nephew of yours? Marina. Close the deal or close the business. - I can't do it. - You're going to marry Alexia. You've been together for 6 years. You live with her. What's your problem? - My problem? - Yes. That I slept with another woman. You know I don't give a crap about monogamy. Alexia is different. She's fun, sexy, intelligent. And the most important thing? - I love her. - And she loves you. She's the love of your life. Yes, yes. I'm a piece of shit. Maybe. But you can't ruin your life because of one mistake. You're right. You're right. I was about to throw myself off a cliff tied to a rock, I fucked up so bad. - I'm fine. Let's go. - You're fine. - Hit me. - What? - Hit me hard. - No, I... - Yes. - I'm not gonna... Thanks. Honey? Let's go! Don't forget, the most important thing is to get that contract. You have to be the best son-in-law ever. - You have to suck up to him. - He hates me. - Laugh at his jokes. - He can't stand me. - Just do it. - He's arrogant. - You'll save our lives. - Don't worry. Trust me. - I trust you. - Babe? Ready? Marina's waiting for us. - Just one thing. - Yes? - I love you. - Love you too. Let's go. Marina's waiting. I'm thinking about something... Are you travelling on your own? First time? Scary, right? Don't worry, you'll be fine. I've always fantasised about doing it in a plane. People say that spicing things up reduces infidelity in couples. Yeah, sure. Sorry? Sure, a plane crashed in Russia yesterday killing 180 people, how could it happen again today? It's impossible. He's a bit nervous. The kid... He's afraid of... Flying. Any drinks over here? Water? Coffee? - Oh, coffee, no. - He hates the smell of coffee. One extra strong americano, please. Thank you. I'm going to the bathroom. Meet me in 2 minutes. - What the hell are you playing at? - She found your card. What could I do? Did you consider how I might feel about all this? - What we did was bad. - Ah it was bad, was it? - Yes, it was bad. - No, the other night was great. It was good. - We had no luck. - Sorry, sweetie! Toilet's busy. - What did I miss? - The other night... There was a plane crash in Indonesia and a lot of kids died. We wouldn't want that to happen again. Planes are terrifying. Ptolomeo must be wearing the same suit as us. It's as if the three of us were getting married. A handsome trio. Why don't we do a photoshoot for Ptolomeo? - What do you think? - Of course. - Done. - Get him an XS. He prefers a slim fit. Slim fit. Got it. Look over the invites, we should finalise them today. I'll be right back, need to make a call. Oh, you sweet little... Ptolomeo! It's pre-wedding jitters. Little shit. Marina. We're out of luck. The gay couple won't put down a deposit. We need the money. You need to sell the full works over there. Whatever. Ponies, ice cream truck, mariachi band... Everything. Don't worry, it'll be fine. Bye. See you, bye. Sorry guys! Whoah, Marina, please. Babe! It's our song! Last year when we went to Mexico, we had this song on repeat. - Do you know it? - Never heard it before. 11:35 in Canarias. There is where the madrilenian band is right now. Honey... Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Tell me first so I don't put my foot in it. Maybe it's a crazy idea, but they could play at our wedding! No, I mean, they're here in Tenerife, we could maybe schedule a meeting? One second. Watch out. Irene, I need your help. There's a group here in Tenerife called... Carolina Durante. Alexia would love for them to play at the wedding. Could you organise a meeting with the manager? OK, thanks, kisses. Your wish is my command. Watch out! Ooh, sorry! - Marina! - Didn't see that bend. Well, here we are. Yes, and in one piece. Dad! - I'm getting married! - How exciting! - You got here so fast! - By the skin of our teeth... - Hi, Arturo. - Hello. One thing. Back in my day it was traditional to ask the father before proposing. - This is Marina, our wedding planner. - Hello. - Son, you're letting her carry the bags? - No, of course not! A beautiful woman shouldn't carry heavy loads. - What? - This way, welcome. No, I can carry it... What do you think? Impressive. Amazing. Look. A perfect view of Mount Teide. Amazing. - Do you live here all year? - Pretty much. I also spend some time in my hotels. Sorry, but I'm sure I know you from somewhere. Are you on TV? - No. - We were at school together. Of course! You're the gorilla! Come on, don't call her that, we're not 10 anymore. - But look, she's matured like a fine wine. - Thanks. - They called you "the gorilla"? - Nah, only a few kids. - Everyone called her that. - The thing is... Marina was quite hairy as a child. It was peach fuzz. I hope she's a better wedding planner than actress, right? Remember the school play, your mind went blank! Took me years of therapy to get over it but hey, whatever! Where is my room? - Second on the right. - I'll go and unpack, OK? In half an hour, we need to go to the menu tasting. - Alright. - Great. - So, Carlos. - Yes? - How are things? - Very good. - Pretty good, yeah. - Any new projects? The design tries to harmonise indoor and outdoor space. I like the proposal. It's modern and a good fit for my hotels. Sit. So, Carlos. Alexia is everything to me. I want her to have a strong man by her side, it's what she deserves. - Thank you... - I was talking about me. Oh, right. So if you can prove to me you're a man who can take care of her, I'll sign a contract with your studio and you'll design the hotels. Good work, son. Ready? - Yes, I'll be right there. - Perfect. I inherited these bottles from my grandfather. There's a 1929 Petrus, a 1966 Montblanc - and a 1958 Angélus... - They must be worth a fortune, right? They are. But telling you their value would be pretentious. - True. - Six hundred thousand. You'll see, the chef's a good friend, Michelin star, she puts so much passion into her food, you're going to love it. - I'll go say hello, I'll be right back. - OK. Hey, Marinuskis! Beautiful! How are you? - So nice to see you! How are you? - I'm good! I heard you and Juanjo broke up. What an asshole... - We just got back together. - He's a gem, I'm so happy for you! I don't know, I feel good! More calm, more relaxed... If I find one bone in that fish it's going right in your eye, OK? How are you? - I'm fine. - You have a little glow. You're in love. You have! Finally! - Who's the lucky guy? - I'm not in love. - You got your boobs done? - Of course not. Amazing, you can't even tell! - Because I didn't get my boobs done! - I won't tell anyone! - Everything looks great! - You already know, in this kitchen we only use the best ingredients. - This is my client, Carlos. - Hi. Hello, nice to meet you. - Likewise. - This is great... Excuse me, I just need to talk to you... You absolute disgrace! You really think you can serve pork loin like that? Come on. - Just like your Dad. - Mum, please. No, out of my sight! - I have to do everything... - What's up? Marina... What? I... - I wanted to apologise. - OK. No worries. Putting myself in your shoes, this must be hard for you. Carlos, really, it's fine. Come here. Sorry, I got your hopes up... and then I just... What did you say? I mean, more or... Sorry, you must be confused. I had a great time and all, but I don't fancy you. Not one bit. Not on a general, physical or intellectual level. Sorry, I have to be honest. - Alright. - OK? - Great, so you don't like me at all. - That's right. I also think you're only marrying Alexia because you can't tell her the truth - but that's another... - Excuse me? Now look here... - That's not why I'm marrying Alexia. - No, of course not. You love her. That's why you cheat on her. I never cheated on Alexia. It's fine, it happens to every guy that cheats on his girlfriend, you know? You're capable of cheating, but incapable of assuming responsibility. - So you try to justify it... - Right. It was a one-off, one drunken night, - magic, or... - No, you know why I did it? Yes. The opportunity came up and I thought I'd never see you again. But life is a funny thing... I like how things are and I'm not leaving Alexia for some one night stand. - OK - Are we OK? - Absolutely. - Really? Totally. - What about you? - I'm fine. Time to go eat! This is ready. Deconstructed pepitoria with a hint of chilli. - They like spicy food? - Yes. This one burns on the way in and on the way out. Manolo! What did I say about the breadcrumbs! Sorry. Oh, you can leave this with me. I want to help. Is that alright? I only put up with you because you're my son. Alright. Et voilà! Yum! What is it? - Pepitoria with a hint of chilli. - Carlos can't, um... - Babe, you shouldn't. - No? Alexia, are you his girlfriend or his mother? Real men can handle spice, right? - Right. - Let's eat. It's delicious. - Should I get another fork? - Just a glass of wine. - You sure? - Yes, thanks. - Do you like it? - It's divine. I would have liked it a little spicier. Right Carlos? No, it's fine. - I can get some more chilli sauce. - No, it's perfect. - It's good, really. - So, Marina... Tell us more about yourself. Are you married? - No. - So you have a boyfriend, - or still looking for your other half? - No, no boyfriend. I'm happy on my own. - Is that some sort of feminist thing? - Oh, Jesus... No, I'm just happy on my own, I don't need a boyfriend to be happy. - You'll meet someone soon. - It's just been idiots up 'til now, but... Look at you girls getting along. They hated each other in school! No, we were great friends in school. That's not true. In school we were just awful to you, Marina. But... I would love for us to be friends now. Lately I've been thinking a lot about that time in my life. Maybe because... Because soon we'll be parents... - Well, not that soon. - No? - Are you pregnant? - Yes... - You are? - No! - No! - I'm not pregnant. We are trying, though. - You shouldn't eat any more. - Let him eat! Eat as much as you want. - The doctor told him... - Who cares about the doctor! This is something to celebrate. Let's drink to my future grandson! - And the parents too, congratulations. - Of course. What fantastic news. So, tell us ab... - Did you just fart? - No. Well, I... Maybe the doctor was right about spicy food. I, um... I'm going to the bathroom to... To fart in private. I'm all... - Good grief. - The doctor said no spicy food... - And still... - He insisted. Irene. Hi there. I wanted to call you first before making a decision, but... I'm kind of messing this up and... I don't think I can do it. OK, talk soon, kisses. Bye. - Goodnight, Don Arturo. - Goodnight. Wait, come here a moment. Look. Just a little kid. Now she wants to be a mother. - Alexia? - Yes? - Can I talk to you? - Can it wait until tomorrow? - Carlos isn't feeling very well and... - I don't get it. We all ate the same. He's still vomiting, but the diarrhoea stopped. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - This is you, right? - No, that's... That's Dayar, he was an Indian exchange student. People always got us mixed up. Ah, poor thing. That's the day we went sailing. - She's been afraid of the ocean ever since. - Really? I had no idea. No one knows. She's ashamed of it. Hey, don't tell her I told you, eh? She'd kill me. Don't worry. The past is in the past. I have to say, I'm delighted you're both getting along so well. Anyway, like I told her, it was just a nickname. What nickname? Marina the gorilla. - It was her idea? - Yes. - Fancy that. - Kids will be kids, anyway... Alright, I'm off to bed. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. "Marina the gorilla". It's a good one... "Finding Lemo". - "Lemo"? - Yep. It's... Cute, right? I guess... Babe? What do you think? Well, I just... Is getting married in a boat beautiful...? Beautiful and very on trend. Very classy. It's trendy to get married... ...in this? No, this boat is just to get us out on the water, to pick a nice route, some nice coves... - The boat's called Cristina. - Yes! After my wife. The apple of my eye. My compass, my guiding light, my haven... That's why the boat's called Cristina and why I moved here, too. - Righty-ho. - Oh, careful. - Take my hand... - No! Oh, what's this? Finding Lemo, laughs and tourism. Someone's calling me. Must be my wife. We call each other every other minute. Every other second! Laughs and tourism. I'm going to... Hello! Yes, my love. Yes. Did I tell you I love you? What? He's a bit weird. I find him a bit creepy. He's a character. A man of the sea. You know, like, the wind... The levant wind, you know... Now, just calm down. I'll get the bus home and you can tell me all about it. Sweetheart. Sweetheart!! Sweetheart! Everything OK, Captain? Yeah. My wife and I, we fall out sometimes. The course of true love, and all that... It's... Right! - Let's get you on board. - Alright! All aboard! Yarr! Let's set sail! Cristina, I've been calling you. We can't leave things like this. Just pick up the phone, OK, Cristina? Alright. I love you. Looks like bad weather. We'll be OK, right? Yeah, we'll stick to the coast to see the coves. - You alright, babe? - It's too sunny, I'm going inside. I better go. Captain. I've seen you a little nervous before. - Are you alright? - Yep. - Is this safe? - Yep! - OK. - Marina. I'm going inside. How is it going down there? Marina, should it be moving this much? Completely normal. Seems like we're going into a storm. Storm? What storm? Just stay calm. You guys get so worked up over nothing. I'll go talk to the captain. What?! Captain? Can I ask you... What do you mean you're shagging Minervo? Minervo's my best friend, love. Tell me you're joking! I swear, I'll do something really stupid. Cristina, don't hang up! So... Gossip time! You remember Cristina, the love of his life, his other half? - Yeah? - She's fucking some guy called Minervo. I'm going to sink this boat with everyone in it. I made the same face, like, Minervo, is that really a name? Oh my God. Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me We pillage, we plunder... Oh, Jesus! - Marina, do something! - Who am I, Blackbeard? He's your friend, get him to take us back, please! Get him to take us back! Watch out. Are you alright? I'm OK. Holy shit. We have to go talk to the captain. Don't leave me here. - Please! Please take us back! - Over my dead body! You're going to get us killed! - That's the idea! - You fucking psycho! If I survive this I'm taking you to court! Take us back, you bastard! I don't want to die! Honey. - What are you doing? - Take us back, Captain! No! This of your family and the people who love you! I only have one friend and he's fucking my wife. - What? - I've known him since I was 3. What sort of person cheats on their partner with a childhood friend? Where are you going? Go inside! This is very dangerous! You're going to get hurt! Listen to me, Captain. Everything seems awful now because you've been trapped in a cycle of emotional dependency with your wife. You might have a point there. You know, this should really be seen as an opportunity. This world is full of wonderful people. You'll always encounter problems, what matters is how you move forward! This is your chance to grow! Thank you! But for God's sake, take us back! Yes! What a crazy thought. I nearly killed us all! No, I know from therapy, you have to leave toxic things behind you. You have loads of new things to achieve and loads of people to meet. Really, you'll be able to... Just lose the glasses, that's my advice. What a woman. So brave. - One more piece of advice. - Yes? - Wash this shirt. - OK. Marina. - How are you? - Good. Can we talk? I wanted to say sorry for what happened in the boat, really. Oh, no, how could you have known? That wasn't your fault. I want to talk about something else. The sea. I've been afraid of the sea my whole life. And after today, that fear has gone away. Like the whole thing was shock therapy. So, good, right? I'm not sure how to... I wanted to tell you that I made up that horrible nickname. Ah. It was you? And I put that glue on your seat, started the "Marina gorilla-bum" song... - It's fine, Alexia. Really. - No, no. - I'm so sorry. - It's fine. And I had completely forgotten about the glue thing, it's in the past. - No. - I mean it. We're fine. - Really? - I promise. Thank goodness. I couldn't stop thinking about it, you know? I've moved past so many things today! That's great, isn't it? - We should celebrate. - Alright. - I'll get the champagne. - Yes, that's... Dad! Come here a minute. Carlos! I love this one. - Do you like this one? - Oh, yes. - What's all this? - You're dressed! - We're going to make a toast. - What's the occasion? - We're toasting to life. - To life. - And moving on... - To the fact that we're alive... You're not going to help her? No, really, I can do it. - I mean, she seems to... - Help her out. OK. Here, I can... - He wants me to help... - I've opened a lot of champagne bottles on my own, there's no need. Alexia, are you OK? Up you get. What terrible aim, and such bad luck. - She's dizzy. - She's gone all purple here. Want to sit down for a bit? - Alright, give her space. - Yes, let her breathe. You can't speak? Can... Yeah, it hurts, I know... What's wrong, honey? Don't panic. What's wrong? - What's that? - No, no, no... Holy shit! Holy shit! I'm so sorry! It was an accident! It was an accident, I swear! I know. Don't panic. - We need to get her to the hospital. - I'm getting married! Let's move! She is going to pass out. Alexia, I'm really so, so sorry. Please forgive me. - It wasn't your fault. - Yeah, but... You should stay, there are good dentists here. I want to go to Madrid, I only trust Dr. González. - I'll go with you then. - No! You and Marina have to go meet with the band manager. - But... - The door! I'll go with you. No, tomorrow we're meeting the priest. I'll be back tomorrow. Give me a kiss. - Don't forget your teeth. - Carlos. A moment, please? That's how you treat my daughter? If you don't get the band she wants, forget the wedding and the contract. But it was an accident. Alexia, it was an accident, you know that, right? I'm sorry. Sorry, but your Dad kept saying: "Open the bottle"... Bye. What a day. When it hit her, I could almost feel it myself. I was like... It's easily fixed. - They use a special paste and it's done. - I hope so, because... This is all kind of weird, Marina. Yesterday, at the restaurant, today you break Alexia's teeth... - It was an accident, Carlos. - Oh, right, and what about the boat? I don't know, it feels like you're trying to sabotage the wedding. That wouldn't be difficult, but, anyway... What? - What do you mean? - Well... You're not going to last two days, Carlos, I'm sorry - but it's so obvious... - Right, I see. - And this is the wedding expert talking. - Well, kind of, yeah. How can you be such an expert if you've never been in a relationship? You like being alone so much - because you're afraid of relationships. - Yeah, right. You might be an expert in other people's love lives but you have no fucking idea how to live your own life. Irene, did you confirm today's meeting? You have an appointment with their manager tonight. - I'll send you the location. - Oh my God, you're the best. I know. Goodnight. Listen, the one thing a musician needs to have is a spark. You've either got it or you don't. And you? You've got it. - No. - Yes, you do. Good evening. Are you Raúl Guzmán? - Depends, who's asking? - I'm Marina, this is Carlos. We have a meeting today about the wedding? It's Saturday. Yes, exactly... Well, I'm sorry but I'm in the middle of something. Let's talk Monday. Very kind of you. Thanks. - Tell me about Shakira. - I gave her the idea for "Waka Waka". She wanted to call it "Taka Taka". - Do something. - I can't force him to... - Arturo's going to cut my balls off. - What do you suggest? Excuse me, sorry, Sir. Sorry to interrupt. I know it's not a good time, but... My girlfriend loves Carolina Durante. She wants them to play at her wedding. - Really? You do? - No, I'm the wedding planner. Your fiancée should be here asking me. - No, she's... She's my fiancée. - Yes. - I'm the bride, the wedding planner... - You know... - 21st century, self-empowerment... - What are you talking about? - I don't know. - You're planning your own wedding? - I'm a bit weird. - She's not wrong there. From what I can see, you guys don't get along so well. Not at all. At this point in my career, I don't work for money. I work for love. And I'm not feeling the love. I'm a romantic, what can I say? Yes but, listen, Raúl. - I do feel the love. So does he. - My love. - There's a lot of love here, we really... - My love... - She's... - Alright. I've got an idea. Can you give me two minutes? Two minutes. I don't care. I charge for hours. - OK, take a seat. - Of course. Let's see. I'm going to do a foolproof test to see if you're in love. - A test? - If you pass, we can talk. Good shit. - Let's start with you. - OK. The first thing you noticed about her. First thing that pops into your head. I don't know. Her beauty. - You love her for her beauty? - Well, why not? I mean... Come on, man, open up a little. Don't just say any old thing. - You said the first thing... - Whatever, love doesn't abide by logic. - Look her in the eyes. - OK. Think about the day you met and let you heart speak for you. - I can't hear it. - I haven't said anything yet. Speak, then. Alright, I will. Um... - The day I met her... - Don't look at me, look at her. - Right. - Of course, sorry. I... Well, I... Nothing. The day we met we were at a wedding. You were the wedding planner. Everything went wrong. It was a complete disaster. The altar caught fire, you put it out with wine. I couldn't stop looking at you and I thought that my life would be awfully boring without you in it. And although at first you seemed a little aloof or standoffish, I thought how nice it would be to get to know you more, and... Nice. Nice, very nice. Goosebumps. OK, your turn. My turn, right. Well... The way he dances, maybe. His eyes. His brown eyes. And the way he looks at me. When I met him, he looked at me, and... I felt like he knew me, and that I could be myself and come out of my shell and tear down all those walls, or... I'd never felt like that before. That's it. Shit, you really love each other. Oh yes, you do. - I was totally mistaken. - In that case, great... Wow, more drugs... You know... - Perfect, now we can talk money... - Yes. Here. No, I don't smoke. This is how we close a deal in show business. - In show business that's how it's done. - OK, but we're... It's fine, smoke. - I haven't smoked a joint in 15 years. - Don't worry, it's not a joint. - It's called the Walking Dead. - And what's in here? Nothing, just a bit of opium, ecstasy and peyote. A touch of MDMA, ket, meth and ayahuasca resin, to balance it out. - This isn't dangerous, is it...? - What am I, a doctor? Just out of curiosity, why is it called the Walking Dead? Because your legs go numb and you end up walking like... Of course, I see it! Don't smoke any more. The taxi will be here in 5 minutes. OK? Are you alright? The joint freaked me out a little. But the fresh air's good. Well, don't freak out. There's no way there were that many drugs in it. You can't fit all that in a joint. If I had really smoked all that I'd be high as a kite, but I'm fine. That guy was weird. - Yeah, he was. - He was weird, right? Just one thing. "Standoffish"? I don't consider myself to be standoffish, not at all... Nowadays people are so intense, you know? You have to set your boundaries. Before you know it, they've moved in. First it's the toothbrush in the bathroom then it's their pyjamas and then you break up, they take everything back... It's a big old mess... Sorry, sorry. I mean... You're about to get married and I'm telling you this, how depressing. It's not depressing. I mean it. You want to know something depressing? I would love to. Alright, um... It's very personal, OK? Wedding planner's secret. Vasectomy. - I know what a vasectomy is. - No, I... You really got a vasectomy? - Why? - Well, Alexia wants kids and I... - I talked to Ben one day and he... - OK, one question. You got a vasectomy... without telling Alexia? No, she already knows. - She doesn't. - You must be joking. Oh shit! You got a vasectomy without telling her. Oh my god... Well... It's reversible, you know. The taxi! Thank God. Sorry! - It's not funny, you know. - I know, I know. Thanks. - Where are we? - Come on, open the door. - You OK? - Yeah. - Sure? - Yep. Time to get some rest and tomorrow... This looks delicious. - It looks delicious? - It's so smooth... - OK, well... - Good evening. Hi, Don Arturo. You're up so late. I wasn't tired after coming home from the airport - so I'm having a night cap. - I see. And... - How's Alexia? - If she doesn't smile, fine. Always good to have a sense of humour. Hello, Arturo. The thing is... We had a bit of a rough taxi ride around Tenerife and he got carsick. We'll go get some fresh air. - You're carsick? - No, not me! Don't freak out, but I think that joint's starting to hit you. Come on. Up you get. Are you OK? - Yes, I'm fine. No worries. - You sure about that? - OK, Arturo can't be seeing you like that. - No. What Arturo shouldn't know is that... That I'm... falling... Carlos. in lo... - Hello, Marina. - Stay right there. - What's with Carlos? Is he OK? - He's fine, just a little nervous. He's getting married, it's normal to be nervous, have mixed feelings, all of that. Yeah, of course. Tell me, how did it go with the band? It was a bit hard with his manager, but we got them in the end. We just need to agree on a price, but it's all up to Alexia. - Yes, whatever she wants. Don't worry. - That's great. We might have to haggle a bit. Carolina Durante are really... - Yes. - Really popular, and are... - ...great musicians. - Yeah. - I'm really happy to be here. - Great. I better be getting to bed. Alright, sleep well. - Where did that boy get to? - He went to sleep, he needed some rest. - Right. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Are you alright? - I think I'm feeling it. - I'm feeling it. - Alright, let's get you up. Careful, now. Thanks. Feeling better? Yeah. - I can almost feel my knees again. - Well, that's a good sign. - And thanks for keeping Arturo away. - No problem. - Crazy stuff. - Yeah. OK, so... I'd better get some sleep. - Ah, but... - Yeah? - About what you said at the hotel... - Yeah... - That was all made up, we had to lie. - Yeah, I mean, I was lying too. Yes and yours was actually quite a beautiful lie. What are you doing? Nothing. You were going to kiss me. You were. Come on... - You opened your mouth like you were... - No, did it look like that? - Carlos, you did a real kissing move there. - No, you're wrong. I wasn't trying to... - No? - I was just getting comfy, that's all. Ah, alright. In that case... - Maybe that's why. - I was confused. Go ahead and make yourself comfy. But... If, hypothetically speaking, I were to kiss you, would that be a problem? Well, yeah. I mean, you're getting married. You're in your father-in-law's house. I think it would be a problem. - I don't want to be with Alexia. - What? I'm going to leave Alexia. - No. - Yes, I'll tell her tomorrow. Wait a minute, Carlos. No, no! - You're not breaking up. - What's wrong? What's wrong with you? I just gave you the toothbrush speech, how can you be dumping all this on me now? - Marina. - No, listen to me. You're going to get married and forget any of this ever happened. No, I can't do it, Marina. - Listen. - I mean it. - Stop pushing me, please. - Sorry, I didn't mean to push you. - I'm trying to tell you something. - What is it? I can't forget you. I can't. OK. I've been trying to get over this for weeks now. I've tried. But I can't get you out of my head. What? Hi. Hi. Marina! - Alexia's here! - What? Pick up the clothes, quick! - This is yours. - What? No, all of it! Babe? - Honey! Here so soon? - I missed you! - We have to go meet the priest! - Oh, yeah. Look at that! - Wanna try them out? - Yes. - What? - You cut me. - It's because they're new. - Hello! - Did it hurt? - Gently. - Carlos? - Yes. - What are you doing here? - Not happy to see me? - Of course I am. How's it going? - I found a cheap flight! - He decided to come join us. - To keep you company, of course! - You came together? - Same flight, same seat. Well, this is some... What? Holy shit. Carlos. Oh, dear. - So... - Wait right there. There's something special here. Something in your eyes, a sparkle... It's... Dazzling. Look at those new teeth! - Eh... Anyway! - No, no. Come here. - Ben! - I'm so happy. I'm so happy you're here. Really. Where are you getting married? - In a boat! - A boat? In a boat, wow. That's amazing. - You know who else got married in a boat? - Who? Those guys in Titanic. Well, they nearly did. - You done now? - Yes, sorry. - I got carried away. - It's just so moving. - Let's go through. Do you want a drink? - Some wine would be great. I didn't have any breakfast, I didn't do anything... A nice glass of wine would... Jesus, actually, it's a little early for wine. Why don't you show me the roof terrace? - You don't want... - No, no thanks, I'd rather see those views of Mount Teide. - Breathtaking. - They certainly are. What was that? What was that noise? - What have you gone and done? - It wasn't us, we just heard a noise. Is this yours? Is this yours? Yes or no? - Yes. - Is that so? - Yes. - I'll tell you what. First you stink up my house. Then, you break my daughters teeth. And now, this? - Get out of my house right now. - Dad, please. You're not marrying my daughter. - Come with me. - Carlos was outside with me the whole time, there's no way it was him. It could have been the wind. You don't realise, you love me so much that no one is ever good enough for me! It's lovely, that you care about me that much. But Carlos loves me too. He cares for me and he's the man I'm going to marry. So you can stop giving him such a hard time. If not, you'll lose me, just like your precious wine bottles. And now, in half an hour, We're going to see that bloody priest. Right, babe? - Calm... - What are you playing at? What? What do you mean, "what"? Marina was naked in your room. I know. - Know where you are right now? - In Tenerife. No, idiot. You're in the relapse zone. It's fine, you'll get over it. - We really like each other. - What makes you say that? - Well... - You fucked, you fucked hard. I have proof. What proof? Did she say to you, "Carlos, I really like you"? - Want to know what she said? - Please. - She said to me... - Yes? "Carlos, don't leave Alexia for me." Are you stupid? Do you want me to throw you off this cliff? - Yes, please. - Be serious. You'd ruin everything for something that doesn't even exist. Shit. Can you give me a hug? And put some love into it? There. Let it out. Carlos. Can I talk to you? - What are you doing? - Sorry. I just love earlobes. Here. This is... My way of saying sorry and officially welcoming you into the family. The hotel contract. What do you say? Shall we sign? This is amazing, really. Um... I'll need to read it over but thank you so much Arturo, really. Stop overthinking, we just got our dream deal. Here's what we're going to do: we're going to phone the agency and say - we've signed a contract. So many zeros. - No way, Ben. Hello. Hello. I'm Marina. Right. I'm Ben. - Nice to meet you. - So, we're pretty happy. - Really? How come? - Because we just signed a little contract... Just a billion euro contract. Yeah... - 3 billion euros. - Wow. Great, congratulations. We're going to design Arturo's new line of hotels. - Yep. That's the big news. - Yeah. Of course. Your father-in-law's line of hotels. Nice. - We just... - No, congratulations. That's great. You and your big mouth. Because this doesn't mean anything. I've not signed the contract yet. - Marina, I want to do this right... - Whatever. - No, really, it's fine. - Marina, please. - Alexia. - How are you? You look great! Like it never happened. - You're not dressed? I was waiting. - OK, I'll get dressed. Your Dad, he... - Are you coming? - Yes. I always go wherever. You should come too. - To the church? No... - Yes, yes. The priest wants to get to know us better and you knew me as a kid, it's perfect. I'll wait for you upstairs, OK? Put your nice grey blazer on, it suits you so well. I'll be right there. - I'm sorry, Marina but we need to talk. - We can talk. - Good. - After we get to church. - No, not at the church. - Yes. We'll talk then. Not at the church. - Emilio. - How are you? What lovely news. And the young couple? - Right here. - Oh, what a handsome pair. - That spark of love in your eyes. - No, no... - The bride is my daughter. - Ah, so you're not... - Just as handsome a couple. How exciting! - Very. - Let's hurry on with that marriage dossier. - Perfect! Follow me please, this way. - This will only take a few minutes. - Alright. What is the marriage dossier, exactly? - It's just a part of the proceedings. - To determine compatibility, and so on. - Or to declare that you are in love. - A type of test. Not exactly. It's to show that you will abide by the Christian values of marriage. Alright. Well, later on we can do a little relationship test I know. OK. - Anyway... - As I was saying, - Arturo told me you're Catholic, Carlos? - He is. - Carlos? - Yes. Yes, yes. Carlos. Carlos. Tell the truth. What? - You're under oath. - No, not yet. No. Even so, lying to a priest is awful. Really awful. Well, yes, but what are you trying to say, here? - No, I... - I met Carlos at a wedding and he didn't know the words to a single hymn, just in case you want to note that down... He's very devout, Father. - That's all that matters. - Of course. I just can't lie, that's what it is. No one is asking you to lie, but if you could stay nice and quiet, - that wouldn't be a bad idea. - Thank you, Arturo. Shut up. - I'll be quiet. - Perfect. - OK, so... - It's that Alexia wanted me to take part. That's why. But if she doesn't want me to, I'll be quiet. - Tell her to shut up. - No. It's fine, say what you have to say. - We don't have anything to hide. - But really, there's no need. I heard you're thinking of starting a family. - Well... - We're in no rush, but... We want three kids: Marta, Olatz and Eric. - Eric? - Fantastic. Kids... We'll see. That's a whole other issue. - I'll shut up now. - You should have shut up half an hour ago. - She means well, I guess. - Just say what you need to say. It's, um... You won't be able to get pregnant yet because... Shut up. Why not? - Because he got a vasectomy. - Alright, to hell with this. What? It's reversible, honey. Alright, Arturo. Let me know when you've sorted this out and we'll talk. Hey, if kids aren't an option then what about a hamster or a cat...? Sweetie. I'm sorry. He looks great. Will you be done in an hour? Will we be done in an hour? Yes. Can't you light him from below? It's more flattering. - Then you won't need any Photoshop crap. - Let him do his job. - I studied photography. - You mean that Instagram class? One "Valencia" filter doesn't make you Ansel Adams. Let's go. Hello. Hey guys! You look lovely. - Marina? - Hi. The wedding's cancelled? What happened in Tenerife? I messed up a little. How so? - Irene. - What? Not now, please. Bye, now. I'm sorry. You're not alone in this, Marina. I want to help you. - Talk to Alexia, you're her friend, right? - It's no use. Even if I could fix it, I don't want to. What's going on? Marina. No. I can't believe it. Me neither. Why didn't you tell me before? - No, no hugs, please. - Don't be silly. Shit. You fell in love. - Let's see what we can do. - I'll think of something. "Valencia" filter, eh? You always have to make fun of me. You just need to relax a little. Or I can just shrug it off, like you! Shrug off the wedding, everything... You need to learn to trust other people. OK? Come here, you old sod. Want the ball, you rabid little prick? Here it is, come and get it. - Stupid dog. - Their wedding has to be perfect. This is just about you, me and Ptolomeo. - What happened? - No, no, no... Maybe it's still alive. Ptolomeo! We can make it up to you. We'll do a discount on catering. Drinks on the house. - Tell them we'll get them a new dog. - A new dog. A smarter one. One that's smart enough to not jump out a... Hello? They're suing us for damages, animal cruelty and PTSD. OK. People get taken to court all the time. It's fine, I'll think of something. But what? Our only option is to close the agency, leave our flats in Madrid, move in with our parents, - and only shop in sales... - Stop panicking, I can't think straight. First of all, the PTSD. How on earth are they going to prove that, anyway? Shit, did she see me? Yes. Marina. Marina. - Marina? - Oh for fu... Alexia. I'm so sorry, I should have called. I wanted to tell you... - No, no, Marina. - I'm really so sorry... - We're going ahead with the wedding. - That's the spirit. - Yeah? - Yeah. I would still love for you to be our wedding planner. What? No. - After the mess I left behind... - Well, I talked to Carlos. We cleared the air. Great. Clear the air, as in... Well, we... We talked about - not rushing into things, pressure... - Important things. OK. - You really did us a favour. - Oh, right. That's why I need you for the wedding. Alexia, I just... I just need to think about it before saying yes. Everything's prepared. - It suits me, it suits you. - It suits everyone. Everyone. So? Marina. OK. Yes? Yes. - Yes! - Yes! Amazing, let's do it! What are you doing tonight? - Nothing. - Mum. Why do you ask? - It's my bachelorette party! - And you're inviting me? I would love to go! Let's drink to friendship! To friendship! To friendship, 'cos I'm with you til the end! - Til the end. - Let's drink to your happiness! - To our new contract! - The contract! And what else? - That's it. - No, no. To Alexia! Let's drink to Alexia, goddammit. - Hello, Madrid! - Hello! I'm getting married! On a boat! I want to thank my friend Marina. She's planning me a killer wedding! - And I want her to come and sing with me! - Eh, no. Yes, yes, yes. Come on! - Let's drink to this. - No way. - Don't put music on... - I won't, I won't... When we were young I bullied her a bit but we've made up! She did bully me a bit, but... What doesn't kill you...! - Listen... - Yeah, yeah. Sing with me! I don't know the words. I love this bit. - Thank you for coming! - It was my pleasure! Ah, shit. OK. Goodnight. Shit, shit, shit. - All good? - All good. Get your jacket. You're getting married, man. - Tell everyone we're leaving in 5. - Got it. I'm sure we can pick up some new clients here. Hello. For any future wedding plans. Excuse me. Just in case you've got a wedding coming up. Hello. In case you're getting married. Or not. - Carlos. - Sorry. Thanks. - Have you got your vows? - The vows! - Are you serious? We have to go back? - No, I've got them here, it's fine. There, you've got them. - Can we stop for a moment? - What's wrong? I just need some air. What's wrong? Wait a second. What's wrong now? Look, mate, I'm sorry but I can't get married. What do you mean? Hey, listen. You know what's happening? You've got Peter Pan syndrome. - Don't start with the percentages. - Time to grow up. Marina won't ever take you to Neverland. - You only care about the contract. - Of course I care about the contract. It's what we've been dreaming of since uni. I don't know when you stopped caring about it. - You know what I've learned from all this? - Tell me. Just how shitty and selfish we can be when we want to be with someone. Don't drag me into this. - Oh shit! Really hot girl, six o'clock. - Where? - Lock the door! - Hey! Let go. I have to go find Alexia and tell her the truth. I'm sorry. Listen. Stop the car! Want me to rip your head off? Is that what you want? I don't know how, but I'm going to do it. It was a mistake! What, am I supposed to run after you? Jesus Christ. Have you seen Alexia? Alexia? Watch out! Unbelievable. Bride is on her way, we arrive at the cove in 10 minutes. And... The groom's here. OK, Marina. Boat in position, bride on her way. - I've got some problems. - Like what? Everything's fine. I can't find Alexia. - She's on her way. - No. I need to talk to her. - You have a whole life to talk to her. - You can't see her before the wedding. It's tradition. Ah! There she is. Wow, she looks beautiful. Marina, Alexia incoming. Carlos, go to the altar. Come on, you look great. Come on. Please, listen to me. If it doesn't last, I know a good lawyer. - Honey, we need to talk. - Not now, babe. Listen, this is a wedding. We're on a boat. Any more funny business and you'll be getting a parochial punch in the face. Alright. Today we celebrate the holy union of Carlos and Alexia. Thank you all. Can I help you? - What? - Do you need help? Actually, yes. Did you see a boat leave just now with a wedding party on board? - I don't know. - Can you take me to it? - No way! - Oh my God... - I've got no time for weddings. - Can I be honest with you? My best friend is getting married to the love of his life, I wanted him to because a multimillion contract depended on it. Like, 3 billion euros? To work on a hotel project that I've been dreaming of. I want him to marry her because I don't want to lose him, I don't want him to leave me. OK? Sick of everyone asking me that. Well I'll be damned! The balls on this one! Let's take my boat, Liberty. - It says "Dylan". - It's a long story, golden balls. It was summer... Now it's time for the wedding vows. Alexia, do you take Carlos as your lawfully wedded husband? Well... That's a good question. What? - No. - Great. One moment, please. I'm sorry. Just a moment. - I'm sorry. - It's OK, um... Tell me what's wrong. I just realise that I can't... I can't marry you. I'm sorry. - Thank you! Thank you! - Arturo, your daughter is speaking. Please. I just... You asked me to marry me. And I said yes. Because I'm supposed to say yes, right? And I wanted to. I wanted to say yes. Right. And now I realise that I never... I never asked myself if I really wanted to be here. I just don't know. I can't help thinking that for my whole life I've been "the daughter of", "the girlfriend of", and Carlos, I can't be your wife if I haven't been myself first. - Right? - Right. I... I've never been alone because it terrifies me. But... I was scared of the sea. Right? And look where I am. I love you so much, Carlos. But you must understand why I can't marry you. - You do? - Of course I do. I'm sorry. - I love you too. - You do? - I love you so much. - You do? - But I can't marry you either. - You can't? I was too scared to tell you. Quiet, please. We're talking about something here. I think the same as you. I was just too scared to say anything. Why didn't you tell me? Because I'm a coward, you know that. I'm telling you now. Not quite in the same words, but... So what are we doing standing here? Board that ship, Captain! Deary me. Don't cry. OK, everyone, well... Wedding's off. - We're not getting married, no big deal. - Hey, wait! - No wedding? Alexia! - Wait, Ben...! No, don't cry! Don't be silly, it's fine. What's done is done. You can continue the ceremony, Father. Carlos fucked Marina. So what? No! - And you fucked her hard, no biggie. - No! Yes! Lovingly, whatever! - Unbelievable. - You'll marry her and that's that. You're made for each other. That's all. Father? Resume the ceremony. Are you out of your mind? The wedding's off. She changed her mind. - How come? - I don't know, she doesn't want to. She needs to focus on herself right now. That's genius! Genius! That's what she told me. Marina? Hello. Hello everyone. This is a joke, right? It's got to be a joke. It's not a joke. I'm sorry, I'm a piece of shit and she's a horrible human being. - And this asshole... - It was you who got me in this mess, eh? - You put the card in my pocket. - It's true. Well you could have thrown it out. - Exactly. - Yeah. I didn't have time, she rifles through everything! Alexia, I swear, when I gave him that card I had no idea he had a girlfriend or that you were his girlfriend or that you would book me for the wedding, - I swear, I had no idea! - Yeah, that remains to be seen. - She didn't know. - You didn't know? No one forced you to plan our wedding. Yet here you are! He's right. So now it's my fault you shagged your girlfriend's friend. No, but it's not my fault either that you shagged your friend's boyfriend! Who made me climb stark naked out of a window the other day, very humiliating, I might add, after our second shag! This happened twice? Maybe, but it was his fault! Because I was on drugs. But that's another story... I never cheated before I met you, Marina! Because it was a magical moment, right? - I don't know why I did it! - Me neither! - Why did you do it? - Beats me! Maybe I fell for you a little. Shit. Oh! You fell in love! Well maybe I fell for you too. - So, what, you're in love with me? - Yes! I am! - There he goes. - You're being a coward. I am. I should have told her the truth, and not gone to the wedding. Hello! Hello! Anyone realise I'm still here? On my wedding day? A day to remember. Right now, I don't... I don't know which one of you is worse. I think Carlos is worse! - That's enough! - Yes, that's enough! The bride is talking to you. Votes against Marina. She's your daughter. That's settled. Marina, out. No, no. Hold on a minute. Marina. You're an ungrateful bitch. I welcomed you into my home. I begged for your forgiveness. And you still came and organised this! But him? He's been lying to me in my face for days, now! What if I've never said anything? You would have married me! Lied to me for the rest of my life! You realise how much therapy I'm going to need after this? You bastard! You really socked me one, Alexia. Man overboard! Get a lifesaver! Somebody do something! Excuse me, excuse me! Mum. Hold this, and this. - What are you doing? - No idea. What are you doing? What a hit! Marina! - Where is she? - Shit. - Where are you? - Marina, breathe! Are you OK? He's fine! We're fine! You've always been a terrible swimmer! What happened? What happened? Alexia punched you in the face. What are you doing? - Saving you. - Thanks. One thing. I've never had a boyfriend, and I don't believe in commitment because everything comes to an end for whatever reason. - This couldn't really start any worse. - Yeah, that's true. So, what are we? Friends? Lovers? Like, you're the love of my life? I just don't know. - Captain! - Yes? Take us back. - There are two passengers overboard. - Take us back! - She's off her head. - And you guys! Aren't you here to play? Well, play, then! No! Not without my daughter! - No! - Who's paying for this boat? To the port, goddammit! Thank you! - Mum! - Hey! Lourdes! We're in the middle of the fucking Atlantic, you bastards! We're freezing! We're still here! I guess we're shipwrecked. THE END Hello everyone. Hold on tight, we've got some bends coming up! Sequence 40, 41, 42. Take one. I would kiss you, but... You're all snotty. Warn me when there's snot, OK? Wait, I have a runny nose. You! You absolute disgrace! Do you really think... That plane crash in Indonesia that killed... Don't start! You're laughing already. There, there. Isn't Alexia your friend from... Shit. Luckily, her dad... I really wanted me to marry... "Me to marry..."? Sorry, I've got the giggles! Are your ready now, Hugo? No, you're not. This'll make one hell of a short film.
