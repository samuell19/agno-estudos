From time to time life changes drastically. I?d no idea that a young man on a snow-covered highway in Northland - - would get such a great impact on my life. I often meet him in my dreams. A small pale figure in way to little clothes. (In Swedish) We have a visitor... Oskar. What? Hallo! Can i help you? What do you want? What... What do you want? Dear me, he almost have no clothes on. Come in. Come into the warmth. Come and have some tea. Here you go! (In Danish) Where is the fridge? What have you done to the fridge? What did you say? I think he said something about the fridge. Are you Danish? Hey? Where are you going? You can't be here. It's private. Where is the harp of the sky? What has happened to the harp of the sky? I don't understand what you are saying but you can't be up here. Come. Let us go down. - Come! Give me a hand. - He has already left. - Should we let him freeze to death? - Of course not. I can't go out in the middle of the night? It's freezing out there. - It knocks on the door. - Blast! What do you want? What do you want.. Oskar? - SOS Alarm, what has happened? - I'm calling from Avatr?sk. (From the telephone) Hallo? What has happened? Hallo? I'm sorry... Sorry, God. What next? This can't be true. Is there nobody, who can remember what to do now? - Yes, Bo? - The creed? And then presents and party? Not yet, Bo. You won't get off so easy. When I have... Caroline? What did I say about mobile phone in the church? - I just have to see something. - No... No! Turn of that mobile! Right now! And put it away! You are probably careless about this, but I'm not! This here is the reason why we come here on Sunday. We are having a little dinner in the church council tonight. You should come. Yes, I would like that but unfortunately I have guests myself. Thank you. It is the first time a priest swears in our church. You may be in a crisis of your life. You may have lost your job. Maybe you have a bad health. And it goes on and on and on. And when we go on our personal Emmaus-walk, we just want to quit. Goodbye, goodbye! - Goodbye and thank you. - Thank you. - Hallo. - Hallo. My name is Lisbeth Wendt. - Can you spare a few minutes? - Yes. I come from Katrineb?k. You know the big institution near the inlet. It's one of the country?s best protected psychiatric wards. I'm doing a big research project. I'm trying to map the inmate's social and emotional abilities. I'm a psychologist and I've come in touch with a young man - - who... who yesterday.. ...tried to take his own life. I thought it would be a good idea for him to talk with a priest about it. He says it's God plan. God is speaking to him. He says it's God plan that he ends his own live. But don't you have a prison chaplain? Someone with experience in these things? No. We haven't had a priest in many years. - No... - I'm... I'm really afraid that he will try to hurt himself again. It was not that kind of a trip I've dreamed about. But I have never been to a closed institution before. And this young man God called upon ... I was curious. On that time I didn't know much about Lisbeth's project. She had arrived to Katrineb?k a couple of months before. The method is not new. It have shown positive results in American prisons. My research examines if pets have positive influence on violent persons. - Like the persons you've got here. - So a couple of dogs can cure the patients? No. Of course not. The aim is to map emotional and social skills. I hope that it will lead to results you can use in your work. I'm not here to cure someone. I'm here to observe and write. Lisbeth Wendt, a psychologist... It's section three. Here is a floor plan for you. (Speaker) Go ahead and step inside the elevator. Do you have any sharp objects on you? Knifes, scissors or stuff like that. I would advise you to take of your scarf and your high-heeled shoes. - I can't walk around barefooted. - It's just a precaution. Everything will be fine. Don't you think? - Knud. Principle officer. Welcome. - Thank you. I will escort you around this department - You have to sign here. - It is an insurance issue. It means that we are not to blame if anything happens to you. Will you please step over here. Do you have any questions? A lot. However, I'm not sure I want to hear the answers. No. Lisbeth Wendt is waiting at the consultant. - Are you psychologist? - No. I'm a priest. I've gotten that all wrong. Well. There is many ways to abreact. So, you are going to work with one of Lisbeth's patients? - Did she tell you about her project? - Briefly. I think she is researching patterns of behaviour and empathy skills. - Have she said that? - Yes. Isn't it true? - Yes, yes. You can say it like that. - What would you say? Don't worry. He can't get out. What kind of people are they... The prisoners? We call them inmates. It's people with very violent behavior. They kill without reason. We have to turn right here up the stairs. - It doesn't have to end this way Lisbeth. - Doesn't it? Funny? when you talked to the press about my project you didn?t mention any limits. - And that is true. - Then why are you doing this? It's not me. It's the commission and the university. - You asked the commission to come. - Sweet Lisbeth... Stop saying sweet Lisbeth. Did you call the commission? Yes or no? The commission has independently chosen to come, after they got our quarterly statement. And I sincerely hope we can end this as good friends. Hallo Helen. I'm really pleased that you are here. Shall we go over in the department? We need 2 minutes before we go in. No problem with me. 03-07 is my coffee break. I'll wait downstairs. - 03-07? - That's his number. 03 is department 3 and 7 is his cell number. - Again.. I'm really happy that you're here. - Of course. I would really like to tell him that God doesn't want him to kill himself. Are you ready? We are going to something called the "zero cell". They go there if they have attempted suicide. 131 00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,999 Normally he's in zero cell. No phychial contact Between you and the inmate. This door has to be open all the time. This is an attack alarm. Press this button, if you feel insecure. Please take off your shoes and put the scarf in your pocket. This is Knud. We are at 03-07. Is it okay, if I see him first? - Yes? - Yes. - Here you go. - Thank you. Hallo. I've brought someone, you shall meet. Helen is a priest and I thought you would like to walk with her. Lisbeth, Lisbeth, Lisbeth... Would you like that? Concentrate. Helen has travelled far to talk with you. Valde, Valde, Valde... - That's his cat. - Valde, Valde, Valde... I'm here because Lisbeth has told me you tried to take your own life. She also told me that you said it's God's plan that you should do it. - Do you feel like talking about it? - Oysters, oysters, oyster... Drip, drip, drip... - It's time for coffee. - We are talking. - Yes. I can see that. Coffee time. - Can we get 5 minutes? I don't think I heard that. Coffee. If God comes should one not accept him? - Would you like a cup of coffee? - Yes. Thank you. Thank you. - Are you okay sitting here? - Yes, yes. He is ready in 20 minutes. They look... quite normal. - Was it unproblematic to share the animals? - No. I got a warm welcome. It's a really brutal place. Welcome to Katrineb?k. 03-06, it's the budgie. - Here you go. - It's so nice. Can it say anything? I think you can! You can say something. Can't you? Can I hear? - And here is the hamster - Yes, 03-02. It's here. You got a visitor! Here you go. - How often does it need fresh water? - 2-3 times a week. Okay?? - That was a cozy place. - Yes. He has been here for 33 years. That?s why there was a rug on the floor. - So the boy gets the cat? - Yes. When he came, he couldn't even talk, eat or use the toilet. - That's why he is perfect for the project. - Yes. What do I know...? Look what I got for you. He's going to live with you for a couple of months. Don't you want him here? That's no problem. It's okay. We can't bring it back right now. I will make sure his gone by tomorrow. You can play with it and... give it food. Okay. It's only today. Now I could use a cigarette. Thank you. Hallo. - Hallo. - Hallo. I'm sorry. When I'm doing assignments I'm not really present. - I'm the schoolteacher. - That must be a challenge. Yes. You're right about that. - My name is John. John Eriksen. - My name is Lisbeth. - Oh. It's you with the animals. - Yes. We've just handed them out. - Not all of them? - Yes, all 6. - What about me? - No, I'm sorry. Give me an animal. I need to have an animal! - Stop it, Eriksen! - Give me a goddamn animal. I want to participate in your goddamn experiment! I want an animal! I'm going to destroy you, you whore! - That gut with the mustache... - Yes. That's him. - And they never found the g...? - No, they never found the girl. Let?s find another place to talk. It's in here I've studied. Here you can see the cells. If you press... - Have your project had any effect? - Yes, for some it has. - And what about him? - Yes, he has... - Lisbeth, we have to talk about this. - This right now, Ove. We are working. We didn't say hallo before. Ove Nielsen, I'm the consultant here. - Helen Schmidt. - Are you one of Lisbeth's colleagues? - Ove, let's talk about this later. - It only takes two minutes, okay? Not now... It seems like everybody thinks I'm your colleague? I would like to explain that. I had to call you a psychologist because otherwise they wouldn't let you in. I've been called worse. What are you arguing with the consultant about? Tomorrow at 11 A.M. the commission from the university will close my project. - Why? - We?ve lost their confidence. I've only got one day left here. Everything has to be settled. I'm afraid, that I've started something I can't control. - I hope you can help him. - I will do my best. Let's try again? Lisbeth has told me about the project, but... I would like to hear more about God's role in this. If... you like to. - The test animals got test animals. - What do you mean? - Oysters, oysters, oysters... - Stop. Stop that. - Oysters, oysters... - Stop. - I don't get it. - Drip, drip, drip... Lisbeth's death little oyster won't pull together. Drip, drip... Okay... - So, do you like oysters? - We're not talking about that. She is asking about God and the prayers. - Tell Helen about.. the "skygame"? - Lisbeth, please. Can I just... - You don't know him. He's circulating. - Oysters, oysters, oysters... - So what's is it with the oysters? - No, tell us about Eriksen. Tell Helen what happened and about God calling. Please.. Come with me. - Don't you need my help? - What do you mean? - Don't you need it? - Yes. Let him talk. We need to have a dialogue. He's playing us. Do you want me to help? Good. Let me talk. Alone. Okay. Sorry about that. How long did you have the cat? Did they take it from you when they moved you up here? - Will you tell me about it? - It's not a "it". No.. - But... The cat? - Valde. Most of the time he was lying here... ...on my stomach. That sounds nice. Back then I had socks... I made a little frog out of them and Valde caught it. I also made an animal out of a chestnut. He really liked that one. That was before I got here. - How does he sleep? - It depends. We give 20 mg Zyprexa and in some cases we give him Iktoviril. Just 2 mg. And then she sleeps until 7 A.M. He claims his cat is able to sleep 21 hours straight. Valde can sleep 21 hours in a row, right honey? Yes. Thank you. Week 3. 03-07 is caring and seems serious about his object. No sign of changes in his sleep cycle. He eats and is more frank. - You've seen it. - Yes. What's the problem? We could keep them apart. Eriksen in is my control group. We got other things to worry about. I need to show you something. I you coming? We found this in Eriksen's cell. Look. You know what happened to Eriksen's family, right? Yes. Why have I not seen this before? - I've just received it from the nurses. - Shouldn?t they go directly to me? Yes. Of course. But they don't feel secure about the situation. But this one... Is the worst. It's made of hair. Human hair. His own. And spit, nails and a chicken bone. And something we think is feces. - Ugh, damn. - Adjusting his medication doesn't work. I think we should protect Eriksen and keep the cat away from him. It will ruin the project. I asked you out of courtesy. I've already made a decision. I should just tell the university that we're quitting the project. Then I'll tell the press about the secretiveness and the medication. - I'm trying to find a solution. - I won't accept that you separate them. The sky was dark as before a huge storm. There was a sound... like a devastating thunderstorm. And the sky was completely covered by Messerschitt bombers - - Ready to bring death and destruction over the cities of Europe. - I won't eat it. - It doesn't want to. - I won't eat it. - Is there a problem? - I just wanted to... - Let's go for a walk. Forget it. Have you calmed down? That's good. No! What the hell are you doing, John? Relax. Relax. Take it easy. - Let me go! - Let go of me! Take it easy... Take it easy... A priest who doesn't talk. Have you ever heard God sing? No, I haven?t. When a cat like Valde smiles... ...Then you understand that God has a plan. I could almost hear the harp of the sky. Have you heard it? - Have you seen it? - No. Valde often lay here... ...in my armpit. He called it God's armpit. How... Did he talk? - No, you don't believe it. - No. But I want to believe. - You could try... - Nobody believes it. No.. - I want to go home. - Do you? Where is home? Why did you call the cat Valde? It doesn't matter. But... thank you for talking. She came back with him. She came back with Valde after a fox had ripped him to pieces. He was stone-dead. He told me himself. Even so, she brought him to me the day after that. Yes, just like that. Get your feet up. Yes. Exactly. Now you should get some rest. Valde? Valde? Valde? Valde? Valde! Open the door! Open, goddamn. I need to go out! Valde! Valde! Kitty, kitty... Come here. Come. Kitty, come... - What is that? - It came to me last night. Outside. The doctor said it didn't feel so good. He said it was weak with hunger. But the fox killed him. He was stuck in the bushes, right? Yes... Maybe it did.. But now it's back. It's not the right one. It's not Valde. You're not in the project anymore after the episode with Eriksen - - but it's important to say goodbye in a good way. You really liked it. Why should I say goodbye? Goddamn. It's not it. You got in until tomorrow. There is nothing else I can do. Be nice. Be nice to it. Help! It's bloody talking! The cat is talking. Help! I don't want to hear it! No! Stop it goddammit. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. I cannot take anymore. Stop it. I'm afraid. Stop it, goddammit. Thank you our Father in heaven, for the protection you have given us today. Forgive us our sins, and guard us tonight - - we confide in you with our body and soul, I place everything in your hands. Amen I think you're right. You're right. - So... What did you get out of that? - He talks a lot about that cat. - Was it called Valde, when he got it? - No. That was something he came up with. And what is the story behind the cat coming back? I need some air. Do you want to come? Everything he says is about the cat and God. What do you actually know about his background? Let's go outside. When the authorities first noticed him, he was 11-12 years old - - and was kept in a hospital with an overdose of sleeping pills in the blood. His mother wouldn?t have him back again. She had moved to Spain. He lived at 2-3 children's homes until he was 15 and ran away Then he lived on the street... Until he killed the Swedish couple. - In Sweden? What was he doing there? - I have no idea. A brutal murder. They sat in front of the window like they were enjoying the view. - What do you mean? - He never told why he did it. They were sitting close with their arms around one another. What about the cat? Where is the cat? He liked the cat. It changed him and his sleep cycle. - And then he choked it. - Why didn?t you say so? Why do is suddenly feel like this is an interrogation? If you want my help, you need to tell me what you know. Things wasn't getting better after the episode with Eriksen Lisbeth! The consultant wants to talk with you. Sorry. I need to fix this. - You need to keep the doors closed. - Yes. You know? No psychical contact. And the scarf... And shoes... Yes, that's fine. I want to ask... I do not blame you for anything. I'm just trying to understand. Why did you choke the cat? I failed. You failed? How? - Where's your scarf? - It's out there. Valde was so strange. He was different. Before he was just a cat. There was something. Something not right. Not right? How was it not right? Like in the hour of the lynx. A lynx sleeps 21 hours a day, hunts in 3 and eats in 1. - But that's 25 hours? - The last hour is beside the others? That's the hour of the lynx. That's where everything can happen. He were to leave at first and then I should follow. So your plan was that the cat should leave first and then you should follow?. It wasn't my plan at all. - I heard the cat came back? - Yes. That's good. What's that? Now where are going home Valde. We shall eat fish cakes.. ..and cowberry. I will give you a bath in cowberry... ...and the harp of the sky. It will sing all night. Now I come. 03-07 is committing suicide! I failed. You have a way with that kid. Oh, there you are. Sorry, he needed me. - We need to talk. - Yes. There is something you haven?t told. - Have you been talking to him again? - Yes. Can we talk? I got many questions. - Can I sleep here? - I can't get the permission to that. Yes. There is many free beds on the top. You stay there yourself? - But I probably won't get the permission. - I will find some sheets. Okay. - Thank you Knud. - Thank you too. Thanks. Why did you give him the cat just for 1 day? I had never thought it would make him... - What? - Try to kill himself. So it has nothing to do with your project? - Do you also blame the project? - You tell me nothing! - I've made mistakes. - But you don't tell me about them! I don't think it's my fault that he tried to commit suicide. Why did you give it to him? He wasn't in the project anymore. To help him. I had to show that the cat was alive. - To get one last day with it. - He said it was another cat. But he became tied to it. He talked and cuddled with it. - Was it the same cat? - Yes. It was the same cat. It has earmarks. I can show you. It's in a freezer in the basement. - Why is it in the freezer? - I wanted to show him, if... ?he thought that he heard it or something like that. I just wanted to let him have one last goodbye. You show him it's alive and then you give him one last night - Was is the last night of your project? - No. Did you like to see what kind of results one more loss would make? Drip some lemon in your oyster to see if it's still alive? Then he choke the cat and tried to kill himself. I don?t know why I did it. I wanted to end the project in a good way. I'm a professional, godammit! If I had known, he would... I would have? I just wanted to help him. I just wanted to help him. Hallo. - So, we got you hospitalized after all. - Yes. Yes you did. Is it true you got a dead cat in a freezer? - Is it a possibility to answer no? - No. Why do you want to see the cat? Do you want to pray for it? 465 00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:23,199 - No. I'm just curious. - We are getting used to dead animal. Here you go. - It's really dead. Are you done? - Yes. Thank you. An experiment... Or an experiment with animals... - Do you think that's a good idea? - No. I don't. Now I've been here for 15 years. I've never experienced an inmate who had a positive effect from challenges. But you have to try something? They are never getting out of here. So you are giving up on them? They are going to be in a cell for the rest of their life. They die after 50 year and we bury them. Nobody will miss them. So it is. You must believe development is possible. You are the priest. Believe what you want. If you ask me... Leave them alone. Turn up the medicine and let's hope they won't grow to old.. I have to show you something. Come with me. This is here she lost it. 03-06 got a bird. This is what she got out of having a bird. Anxiety and pain. It can show interesting results but it takes months to stabilize her. - And what about him? The boy. - Yes. What about him? - What do you know about his background? - We know what we need to know. He killed to innocent people with no reason. Now he is receiving medicine to sleep and to wake up. - Has he got a journal? - Yes. Can I see it? - You don?t back off? - Well, no. I'll be right back. Here's something to read. Thank you. I can't look out for you all night. - You?re off your head. - Oh, no... I'm a priest. Yes. You know the rules. If something is up, you know... I also couldn?t fall asleep. I read about you grandfather. His name was Valde. Per Valdemar. Valde is none of your fucking business. I had a grandfather once. He is dead now. I really didn't like him. He was a tough man. Especially towards kids. I couldn?t do anything right. I actually think he's the reason I wanted to be a priest. You don't even believe in God. A priest who doesn't believe in God, can't understand me. Give me at change to understand. Valde died. The fox killed it. But it came back. How can you be sure that it's not the same cat? It knew everything about me. Goddamn. Valde knew everything... about the harp of the sky, the frogs and oysters. I didn't believe it either. A cat that rises from the grave. A cat that speaks. It's insane. But he did. He made me happy. Valde was inside me. Everywhere. Like the sun, light... We laughed and talked. He even made me cry. But why did you choke it? - He convinced me. - About what? That we were going home. Together. Therefore, it came back to... get you? I said I didn't want to. He said I was scared and I didn't dare to do it. Yes... I can understand that. When we woke up the next morning I understood everything. Then i said: "I?m not scared anymore. But you have you go first Valde.? I really wanted to go home again. We were going to live in my grandfather?s house together. I thought it sounded great. In my grandfather?s house there is a lot of apartments. If not, I would have said to you - - that I'm leaving and arranging a place for you to be. - And when I'm gone... - To arrange a place for you... Then I will come back to you - - because I shall be where ever you are. Will you tell me about you grandfather? - I don't want to! - Come on! Stop it. (Swedish) Five minutes, honey! Hallo? Goddamn, didn't you hear what I said? I don't want him here. I can't have him here...! - Don't make a mess of my things. - I can't have him here! I said no, goddamn! I see that you made a mess in my stuff. You're still a bastard. - You can't come along with... - It's called grandchildren. - Does he talk Swedish? - No. But he's good at crying. (Danish) Aren't you? Have a good time, darling. (Swedish) You can teach him some of your religious nonsense. Stop crying! Stop it! Don't cry! Sleep well. Hallo! Kid? Hallo! Where the hell are you? Can't you here me calling? Hallo! Little brat! Why the hell aren't you answering? (Danish) I don't understand anything that you are saying! Okay, and then you just... Then you just shut up? Your mother will probably ask for you when she need maintenance payments. Our Father 568 01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:45,839 in heaven hallowed be your name Your Kingdom come, your will be done, On earth as in heaven... - I'm sorry, Grandfather. - Valde. My name is Valde. You're just a little heathen. But that's going to chance. - Not lemon, but sugar. - Not on my oyster. - Oister...? - Oyster. Now eat. Come. Your job is to guard the frogs. To protect them. - Guard? - Yes. Against snakes, foxes and the lynx. - The lynx? - Yes. The Swedish tiger. - The lynx. - And against mom? Yes. She has kissed many frogs, but none of them turned into a prince. We thank you our Father in heaven - - for the protection you have given us today. Forgive us our sins, and guard us tonight - - we confide in you with our body and soul, I place everything in your hands. Can you read? _ Not much. - Can you read a little bit? "My". "Her"... "His". - No! - Yes, "his". What the hell? Goddamn! Remember your medicine. "And the sky was completely covered by Messerschmitt bombers" - - "ready to bring death and destruction over the cities of Europe." "Then the first airplane came rumbling through the skies." Listen to the harp of the sky. The harp of the sky is singing. Is it that sound "ouii, ouiii"? - What is the harp of the sky? - I think it's God. Sometimes he sings like that. - Is it something you know? - I think it's him. - What is he singing about? - I almost know it. But... you have learn to listen if you want to understand it. - Can't he speak? - No. However, he is good at singing, if you understand it. Valde... Can you always hear God sing? No. Only in the hour of the lynx. The hour of the lynx? The hour beside the others. The 25. hour. Right now. A hour, where we are the most happy, little Lasse. Come here. - Hallo. - Hallo. - Did you sleep all right? - Yes. Fine. - I feel terrible. - Lisbeth, the commission is waiting. Yes. I catch you later. Hallo. - Are you leaving now? - Yes, in a short while. May I give you absolution for your sins? Come and sit here... On your knees. God, you know our secret thoughts, the deepest meaning of our words and actions. In the name of the father, for his sins and death? This is the most holy. This is where, I've been and observed. - Come inside. - Thank you. He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Christ. Peace be with you. Now you may stand up. You smell like my mom when she was nice. Lisbeth, I'm sorry... But I don't feel like the management have kept their promises. I strongly feel that I owe you my gratitude. Thank you. Thank you Knud. - Drive safe. - Thank you. Helen! I just wanted to say goodbye ... before I go the commission. - Have you said goodbye to the boy? - Yes. Let's hope he gets better. A little holiday would be good for you. Yes. - Thank you for the help. - No problem. It has to be now! Lisbeth? Yes, hallo? (Swedish) Your mother has called. She needs the maintenance payments. She will come and get you on Monday. So this is the place where strangers had taken possession of his paradise. Here he had done something terrible. I burred him with is cat, even though that's illegal. The following year I quit my job. Maybe it was stupid, but if you are starting to see God as a red cat - - and grandfathers house as love, then it's hard to stay. I learned something that day with the boy. Something that has helped me and that will help me when I shall die. I hope I will die lying in the armpit of God... In front of the window in grandfathers house. White snow and full moon. Listening to the harp of the sky, the telephone wires, that sings. Then maybe I will understand how everything is connected. English subtitles By Jenslyn123
