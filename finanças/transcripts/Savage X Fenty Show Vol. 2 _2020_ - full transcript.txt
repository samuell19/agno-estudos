Ten year old me had secrets. Ten year old me did not put secrets down on paper. - As a child, I was definitely a bit of an alien, or a bit of a creature. Just felt very feral. - I always wanted a diary, but I always thought my mom would get into it, so my diary was always in my head. - If my little girl, uh, snuck into my diary today, I wouldn't want her to read half of it. - Just don't go in the diary. That's all I'm gonna say, just don't go in the diary. - You know, if she gets to that "to be continued" ellipses part, I think that she'll have a lot of hope in her heart for, you know, what's to come. - So me telling my 10-year-old self at 32 now, just roll with it, girl. Just go. Be grateful always, be thankful always, and just let God take you on the ride. Creation for people are driven from within. - WOMAN: She loves something if it's a story. - I think we have a unique opportunity to use this concept in a way that hasn't been done before. - Let's talk about that chick. (laughs) Rihanna the creator. - I don't think about this pink in lingerie ever. Inspiration can come from anything. What makes it unique is your own interpretation on that message, that color scheme, that texture, and so everything that I do is gonna be personal to me, when it comes to Savage, especially, but... I want to kind of establish that as something core to the brand. I think we should make... - DENNIS LEUPOLD: I think she's very, very observant how beauty, how make up, how styling affects how people react to you. - WOMAN: ...tone pink, but more... - RIHANNA: We gain inspiration from everything that we're around, and we have just been blessed to have the opportunity to be around a lot of different experiences, a lot of different cultures, and we try to take advantage of all of those experiences. - OMAR EDWARDS: When you travel the world and you experience these different countries and cultures, you reflect that in your daily life. - RIHANNA: Whether it's Japan or Paris or the U.S... Wherever I see a fabric, the first thing I want to do is touch it. And I get into a lot of trouble at museums because of that. Whether it's a shoe, or whether it's a piece of fabric on a tablecloth, she has that eye that spots beautiful aesthetics, and sometimes imperfections and makes them into this global sensation. (indistinct chatter) - This was screaming, it's so fresh and perfect. - You can really see her come to life when she works on something and it gets her excited. - I love the hot pink. It's so fucking dope. - EMILY WHITEHEAD: It's like tapping into, like, the fun side of design. If you try too hard, then it becomes stale. But if it's kind of spontaneous and fun, it works. - RIHANNA: And I'm the number one customer so... - WOMAN: Same. Same. - So what the fuck is it, then? Savage X Rosales? - Do I get number two? - (laughing) Can I at least be number two? The experience of fabric is completely different. Seeing it and feeling it, you can't really grasp how beautiful fabric is until you come into contact with it personally. This is amazing. This feels so good. I get to see fabrics, I get to experience them, I get to say this is tacky, this is gonna itch, this is gonna not feel great on our bodies. By the time it becomes produced, you get to see it in its full realm, you get to see it perform, you get to see it move, you get to see it lay on the body. - EMILY WHITEHEAD: She has a lot of experience having couture garments fitted on her, lingerie, and so she can just look at something really quickly and just know exactly what it's gonna do. - We need the curve to marry in front. - WOMAN: Okay. - And that kind of steers us and makes it better, but also makes it hers. She puts her stamp on it.

I'm from Los Angeles, California. That was Ella Mai. That was Roddy Ricch. Thank you. - RIHANNA: I feel like a true bad bitch comes to life whenever she puts an outfit on. If I could switch, getting new personas is creating new avenues to expand. It really is inspiring to me how you can use colors, paint, make up, textures just to embody whatever you want to. I watch drag queens do the same thing when they draw on their lips and all of a sudden their entire demeanor changes. You can see the confidence, you can feel the confidence. There's a huge emotional attachment to that, and there's an empowerment within that. - MAN: We all have multiple personalities. There's so many different parts of us that are colliding and weaving themselves together. That's powerful. - CIARDA HALL: I changed my hair all the time growing up. Dyed it blond, dyed it orange, dyed it black. - I want a pixie. No, I actually want to be blond. - I always want my art and my fashion to be where I express that evolution. - I'm, like, fuck it. Just be you. - Using make up and hair to kind of float through all of genders and sexuality. - Like, if I wear Burberry, I might feel classy. If I put on some Doc Martens, that might mean I'm about to kick a bitch in her face. - Fashion is just an extension of expression. It's your very first impression, you know, that you give and get from people. It's fun to watch artists like Rihanna do it so effortlessly. That's what being a creative and being a shape shifter is all about. Rihanna's the queen of it. - She has so many personas and roles in her, and the sexuality is elegant. They're all part of her personality, and she can, like a chameleon, go from one to the other. - Oh yes, it's a mood thing for me, girl. It's a mood thing always. - MAN: Rihanna is somewhat demure. She's super, like, reserved and chill, and those are sides that people probably will never really see unless you, like, knew her. She's Robin. It all about the mood. - So much inspiration comes from my mood in regards to my fashion. If I'm feeling lazy, I'm gonna wear the biggest hoodie, the biggest sweat pants. And be just as bummy as I would feel when I'm not feeling my prettiest. Whatever makes you feel the best just go for it.

Sometimes it tainted because you've had horrible experiences, or been robbed of your own power. - PALOMA ELSESSER: Sexuality is inherently powerful. It's kind of been co-opted into a performance for someone else. But sexuality is so deeply each of our own. - GIGI GOODE: For me, sexuality is not for anybody else. I am a virgin. I mean, like, I love fooling around, don't get me wrong. It just hasn't happened. - You're not worried about nobody else feelin' you, like, you're into your own fantasy, you know. - I know, I turned 30 and I just like don't give a fuck. Like...

I want to make stuff that I can see on the people that I know, and they come in all different shapes, sizes, races, religions. Whether that comes from my household and my childhood, to the circle of family that I've created around me. I really care that they be a part of what I do. - Not everyone's the same. You have a slew of people that you love and enjoy and admire, and when she creates anything, she thinks of all the people in her life. - The beautiful thing about Rihanna is that she's a global artist, and she includes everyone. - She kicked the door down and she opened up the world to all these possibilities of make up, fashion, lingerie, all that being for every size, every shape. That's some, like, ballsy, powerful shit. - MARGIE PLUS: Found a community of creatives that are pushing the boundaries, and showing that that uniqueness, girl, is what you need to start with. - JENNIFER ROSALES: To work on something and love it is enough, but then to have it received globally the same way is just... next level. - WOMAN: We are strong women and strong men... - RIHANNA: Inclusivity for me has always been something second nature. It's not anything I really think about. - I would never have thought Rihanna had sizes that would fit me. I asked her and she said yes. - RIHANNA: I didn't think it would be such a talking point after the fact. The only thing I could think about was including everyone. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪ Sim'e mnyango ♪ ♪ You need to open the door ♪ ♪ Sithi nkqo nkqo nkqo nkqo ♪ ♪ Sithi nkqo nkqo nkqo nkqo ♪ ♪ Ey yo ♪ ♪ Sim'e mnyango ♪ ♪ Sim'e mnyango sim'e mnyango ♪ ♪ You need to open the door ♪ ♪ Open the door, open the door ♪ ♪ Sithi nkqo nkqo nkqo nkqo ♪ ♪ Sithi nkqo nkqo nkqo nkqo ♪ ♪ I am the zef kid ♪ ♪ Future baby on that next shit ♪ ♪ Got you feelin' all warm and fuzzy 'cause I blessed it ♪ ♪ With all my love and affection ♪ ♪ Every time I bust it ♪ ♪ They say you fuckin' crushed it ♪ ♪ I am the softest ♪ ♪ But I still jump on the mic and spark a fuckin' mosh-pit ♪ ♪ We represent The House of Zef ♪ ♪ Rock "Fuck you hater" chains around our necks ♪ ♪ Every time we spit, it sound so fresh ♪ ♪ Keep hearing our voices inside your head ♪ ♪ We represent The House of Zef ♪ ♪ Rock "Fuck you hater" chains around our necks ♪ ♪ Every time we spit, it sound so fresh ♪ ♪ Keep hearing our voices inside your head ♪ ♪ What am I? ♪ ♪ What am I, what am I, what am I?
