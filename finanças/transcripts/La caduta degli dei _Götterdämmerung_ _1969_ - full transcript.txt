- Janek! - Here I am, Baron. Come on. [cello playing, muffled] [grunts] Rub hard! - Everybody here? - No, Baron. Not everybody. Who's missing? Mr. Bruckmann and Hauptsturmführer Aschenbach, who shall have to arrive from Oberhausen. And the old man, huh? [chuckles] Baron Joachim. [scoffs] Come on, talk. [Janek] Baron Joachim is in his apartment. He's getting dressed for dinner, and so are the others. And my son? Can't you hear him? - [cello continues] - Hah. Gunther. Gunther! What do you want, Thilde? Come. Come. Come. What do you want? See? Just like last year, Thilde. No more, no less. Yes, but last year I was part of the audience. Instead, this evening it will be different. [chuckles] I hope I don't forget my part. It will be a grand debut. Tomorrow your name will be in all the newspapers. All right. Thank you. All right. [man] A little compromise today, a little compromise tomorrow. And one fine day, we won't even be able to find our chairs. Yes, dear. I'm almost ready. You know how Uncle Joachim insists on punctuality. - Especially this evening. - Please help me. - Darling, stay still. - [sighs] Thank you, dear. You see, one can't always be saying yes. They're not reasonable people. The more you give them to eat, the more ravenous they become. Darling, it's 40 years that Uncle Joachim's been at the helm. And always with... with equilibrium and firmness. [scoffs] Equilibrium. You've used the right word. A favor to the Liberals, one to the National Socialists. - A favor to me and one to Konstantin. - Herbert, you're not being fair. Joachim is certainly not soft with that "particular gentleman." Because he's a snob. If Hitler were not the son of a customs agent and a servant, Joachim would have already thrown himself in his arms. Yes, I know, but you must admit he took your advice and didn't even give a mark to the National Socialists. That's only because he's so miserly. The children? Oh, you'll be hearing them soon enough. They must be so nervous. - Come on, Herbert, let's go. We're late. - Thank you. - Come, darling. - Yes. [reciting together, indistinct] Aha! [chuckles] - Happy birthday. - [laughing] - Hmm. - Best wishes for your birthday. Come here. I thank you. I thank you, too, my dear. My little dear. Happy birthday, sir. Janek. Ah. [laughter, muffled] - Listen. Do you hear them? - Yeah. [laughter continues] Ever since she was born, she's always had someone to tell her, "You are the most intelligent, you are the richest, you're the most envied, you're the Baroness von Essenbeck." How can I ask her just to become Mrs. Bruckmann, the wife of an ordinary executive of the steelworks which bear her name? "An ordinary executive" is not exactly the right term. You have Uncle Joachim's confidence and Herbert's. And Konstantin would never make a decision without you. - Doesn't that mean anything to you? - Or something. - But it's not enough for Sophie. - [chuckles] Oh, I've made a career for myself, but I'll always be one of her employees. If we decided to get married tomorrow, old Joachim would suddenly lose that confidence and liking for me. He likes to believe that she's the inconsolable widow - of the adored son, the hero. - [both chuckle] - [horn honking] - Idiot. He'd probably sack me on the spot, you know, Wolf. No, Friedrich, you are wrong. Today not even his 10,000 slaves working his mines and factories, not even his money, his castles have enough power to put you out. Because we have the power. And we want you to remain where you are. If anything, we want you to climb even higher. [chuckling] [chuckling] Over whom should I climb? Herbert? Oh, the fact that Herbert's got to climb down is no news to anyone. His hostility towards the National Socialists is a little too apparent. [clicks tongue] - But Konstantin... - Konstantin? - Mmm. - Does he have that much effect on you? Well, he's a member of the SA. He has connections with Röhm. Our large industries will need men like you. And our chancellor has a weakness for big industrialists. - [horn honking] - [chuckling] In any case, it wasn't Konstantin I had in mind. [reciting in Italian] [applause] Do you think they would agree to an encore? I think even more than one, so don't risk asking for it. [chuckles] Then I will give up the idea. [chuckles] - Oh, Erika, that was beautiful. - Wonderful, my dear. Wonderful, my dear. You were perfect, Thilde. Come, sit down. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Oh, thank you. Bravo. Thank you. - Bravo. Bravo! [chuckles] [grandfather] Very good. [family chattering] [playing classical] You are the first to hold yourself back. [cello continues] You seem to be ambitious, but you're only a social climber. Sophie wouldn't be happy. You worry too much about Herbert and Konstantin. And you forget there's somebody much more important than they are... Joachim. You must realize that today, in Germany, anything can happen, even the improbable. And it's just the beginning, Friedrich. "Personal morals are dead. We are an elite society where everything is permissible." These are Hitler's words, my dear Friedrich. Even you should give them some thought. Tonight, for example. [playing continues] [playing ends] Wonderful, my dear. Perfectly good. I've so enjoyed it. Thank you so much. [chuckles] I know it doesn't matter to you, but your son is really talented. [scoffs] - Good evening, sir. - Oh. [murmuring] - [murmurs] - Thank you. Good evening.

The Berliners are on the terraces, enjoying the spectacle. [young man chuckles] Perhaps I shouldn't be here. The SA have been confined to their barracks. Keep calm, Konstantin. The coup d'état has failed. Wherever your battleground is, it's not Berlin. Or at least it never has been until now. In any case, the fact that we've uncovered the leaders of this conspiracy proves... What conspiracy? It's clear it's only a pretext. That's farfetched, Herbert. [laughs] Herbert's theories are always farfetched. [laughing] It's a deliberate provocation. It can only be somebody who's against the government. If there is anyone who doesn't need a parliament to govern us, it's your chancellor. Herbert, please. [Herbert] All Germany knows there is a list of proscribed people. And now is the moment to get rid of all opposition without trial and without publicity, with all Europe looking on! The internal order of Germany cannot interest Europe. [Herbert] What internal order? The kind that allows his friends to enter homes and kill? [woman] Herbert. Please. Wasn't it perhaps your Goring who promised the enemies of the Third Reich enough rope to hang themselves? You're losing your head, Herbert. Göring refers to the communists. Perhaps you're a communist too. Today it's the communists. And tomorrow? Don't worry about tomorrow. At this very moment, there is someone in Berlin who is already doing the worrying. Isn't that so? - Well said, Cousin Sophie. - [Konstantin laughs] Our only worry should be the celebration of Uncle Joachim's birthday. Even if this is not a night like all the others. - [man clears throat] - [chattering] HAPPY BIRTHDAY - [clears throat] - [chattering] [loud thumping] For a long time, I have intended telling you what I am now about to say. The dramatic events which occurred in these last few hours force me to overcome any hesitation and uncertainty and go ahead. In all these years, you know that I have had only one object, to hold on to the unity and prestige of our firm. For that reason, I always tried to adjust our work and our structure according to the circumstances. During the Great War, during peace, during... crisis. Now, in the face of these recent dramatic events, I maintain that it is more than ever necessary to protect the Essenbeck steelworks from eventual political pressure or from even greater risks. You must admit that I never yielded to this regime. And everybody knows I never had and never will have a rapport with that, uh, "gentleman." Nevertheless, in the interests of the factory, our production activity compels us to keep in daily contact with these people. This is why I feel an indispensable need to have at my side a man in favor of the regime, who can guarantee us... All right. My resignation has been ready for some time, Joachim, if this is what you're asking. I am forced to do it, Herbert, against my will and without strong conviction. - But the steelworks... - [Herbert] Yes. Right or wrong, they must always come first. That has always been your creed. You even sent your son to the slaughter so you could say, "The Essenbecks put children and cannons in the world with the same sentiment." And with the same sentiment they'll be buried! Forgive me. The children. I congratulate you, Konstantin. You'll be the vice president that we deserve. [glass clatters] Come, Herbert. Please. [laughs] I hope I don't follow in the footsteps of my predecessor. Agreed, Friedrich? [glasses clinking] [in German] ♪ Boys, for tonight I 'll choose just who I want ♪ - [Konstantin chuckles] - ♪ A man, a real man ♪ ♪ >4' Boys, I'm so tired Of all these young ones 4' ♪ A man, a real man I' If it suited him, Aschenbach would stab me in the back. I know that. But not this time. He's on my side. On our side, Sophie. Herbert was right. They did set the Reichstag on fire. Coming here in the car tonight, Aschenbach was perfectly clear, in his own mind, that it was going to be successful. We talked about you and about me, about... Joachim, about the steelworks. But underneath all that... underneath all that, he was saying, "Tonight you will be given a special opportunity. It's up to you to decide whether to take it or not... whether to be with us or against us." You understand what that means, Sophie? [chuckles] I can't believe they'd put Joachim's name on the proscription list. He's much too important to them still. Herbert... perhaps. - Yes, probably Herbert. - [gasps] Strange things will happen tonight probably. And the only losers will be the onlookers. I feel as if I've been given a... a special mission. - [sighs] - And if I accept it, if I take that chance, they'll give me all their help. And there won't anymore be a Herbert or a Konstantin or a Joachim. I will be in command. I will make decisions. You and I, Sophie. [Sophie] What have you decided? It will be the first decision I've taken without consulting you. You did well, Friedrich. Even if I will never know how to push you enough. [Sophie breathing heavily] Go. Go. And go to the limit. None of them are worth even half of what you are. You did well to wait, to always say yes, to thank them. But now you must make them pay. All the times that Herbert tried to push you aside, that Joachim looked down on you. And Konstantin, with his protector air, always trying to help you, to offer you a hand... he's the worst of all. Ah. Don't be afraid, Friedrich. [Friedrich] I'm not afraid. All we have to do now is to convince your son that I can do the job. I'll take care of Martin. I know Martin's desires. [exhales] He has no sense of values. The steelworks or a Rolls. [chuckles] It's all the same to him. We'll throw him the bait. Leave it to me. Bomb! [scoffs] - [both laughing] - I've won. I've won. - Yes, you've won. Where's Erika? - Erika, come. - I've won. You can come out now. - Erika! [Martin] Erika! Where are you? - [Thilde] Erika! - Erika. - Here I am. - Ah, there you are. You naughty little thing. Come here. Oop-la! Now it's your turn. Come. Put your hands over your eyes, Erika. Like that. Now count up to a hundred, out loud. [mouthing words] [Erika] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20. Erika. Come. [Konstantin laughing] Drink! Let's not talk anymore. Drink. I will not leave my school. You'll leave that dirty hole. You'll come with me to the factory. I'll drag you if necessary. But I swear, in ten years, you will be in a position of command, in a position to even throw me out. At the cost of breaking that damn cello over your head. You're getting to be like your mother. The same delicate stomach. Never wanted to put her foot inside the factory. The heat of the ovens... made her giddy. [scoffs] - Listen, Papa, I've decided... - I'll decide for you. I know you can't bear me. But, uh, even I... [chuckles] I don't ask that you love me. On the contrary. But I don't intend to leave that seat to that eager Friedrich. Neither to Martin. I'll tie you to it when your time comes, and God help me if I don't. Those bastards have poisoned your mind. But we'll tear that school of yours to pieces! Including all their bloody damn books! Gunther! Gunther! - Erika. - Shh. Do you want her to find us so quickly? Shh. [footsteps departing] - [knocks] - [Herbert] Come in. Gunther. Come in. [man] Yes. All right. As I foresaw. Before daybreak, Herbert will be arrested. [fire crackling] Poor Herbert. And to think that we're so close to the border. Will there be a trial? Is there a specific charge? I don't believe such formalities are necessary. We just have to be careful of their substance. And the substance is this. Before the flames of the Reichstag are put out, the men of old Germany will be reduced to ashes. Nevertheless, a semblance of legality can also be useful... sometimes. But now you must excuse me. I'm tired and would like to retire. Sophie. Friedrich. If you need me... [woman] But to leave like this, like thieves. We aren't the only ones, Elisabeth. Every day there are a lot of people who have to leave for other parts of Europe. We can say we are among the more fortunate. At least we know where we're going. We have friends. But when? The time it takes to get ready and hand over the office at the factory. - It's all over, Gunther. - [gasps] It was our fault. Everyone's, even mine. It does no good to raise your voice when it's too late, not even to save your soul. All we have done is give Germany a sick democracy. The fear of a proletarian revolution which would have thrown the whole country to the left was... was-was too great, and now we can't defend it any longer. Nazism, Gunther, is our creation. It was born in our factories, nourished with our money. I know what you're thinking, that I shouldn't run away. And perhaps you're hating me for it. No, Uncle Herbert. I... We'll keep in contact, won't we? Yes. It's so late. What are you doing? Where's Thilde? Do you know, Erika? - I don't know. - Thilde. Thilde! Thilde. [in Italian] Where has she gone? Don't you know? It's time to go to bed. Immediately. It's very late. Thilde. Thilde! [woman screams] [exhales] [pounding] [pounding continues] Herbert! Herbert. They're here. They've come to take you. You haven't got a moment to lose. - Elisabeth. - Oh, no. No. Herbert, you haven't got a moment to lose. For the love of God, hurry! - Don't worry. Darling... - Hurry! [pounding continues] [pounding stops] Herbert! You're mad to take that. Give it to me. - No. - |'ll get rid of it for you. And hurry! Hurry! Herbert. Darling, quickly. Quick. Quick. Take care of the-the children. Darling, just go. Go, go. Herbert, no. This way. Quick. Come on. [pounding on door] - [man] Open! - [pounding continues] - Open! - [pounding continues] [breathing heavily] Do you, too, recognize this weapon? [sighs] Yes. The weapon apparently belongs to Mr. Herbert Thallman. Should we continue with our investigation? Let's leave it to the legal authorities. Mr. Thallman has taken a file of compromising documents concerning the most recent research in the steelworks. It could be very useful outside the Reich. He cannot make any concrete use of it. [clicks heels] To the prosecuting attorney. 18th of February, 1933. Subject: The incrimination of Herbert Thallman, fugitive, for the first-degree murder of Baron Joachim von Essenbeck. I know what you are feeling, my dear Martin. But you can't, from one day to another... assume such a big responsibility without feeling, let's say, uh... afraid. But neither I nor Friedrich will leave you alone. We say, however, that you'll have all the time to continue your studies and to take in hand the problems of the firm. They aren't small problems, believe me. Meanwhile, Friedrich and I will keep the business going as we have always done in the past. I had really hoped that you wouldn't have to assume the presidency of the steelworks under such, uh, tragic circumstances. But, uh... unfortunately, I still wanted to say that... [Martin] I... Grandfather was right. In these times our... our plant... Yes, after all... [sighs] Either it is in agreement with the government, or else our business, our advantages... I don't pretend to be a businessman. Not even a politician. However, this I know too... it's a matter of... fact of special produc... production. There are technical problems. [Konstantin laughs] Good! [laughing] Very good. You've even made a crowning speech. Now, however, don't exaggerate. Let's try to give this meeting a rather more familiar tone, huh? [chuckles] - Uh... Joachim's intention... - I beg you, Konstantin. Martin has not finished. He's still saying something. Let's listen. Uncle Konstantin, I will respect all of Grandfather's will. He has nominated you vice president, and it's fair that it should be so. But... But-But I think that in a moment like this, I think... Yes, in a moment like this, the presidency, above all, needs a technician. - What kind of a joke is this? - [Sophie] It's not a joke. Enormous interests are at stake. And Martin thinks... As far as I know, it's the first time that Martin ever used his head to think. I inherit the major stock, and it's up to me to decide. It is up to me to decide. [laughing] [laughing continues] I nominate Friedrich Bruckmann president of the administration and general director of the Essenbeck steelworks and all its associated member groups. [exhales] Friedrich Bruckmann. I pulled you up like this from the nothing that you were. Herbert's pistol. Aschenbach's testimony. The arrival of the SS. [sighs] Too much fantasy, Konstantin. You come with me. Today, you, too, learned something. Things you are not taught in a school like yours. Come. Don't have any illusions. This war has just begun. [Konstantin] Gunther, come! [sighs] [gasps] [sighs] [sobbing] [ceremonial march] [march continues] [march continues] [hissing, rumbling] [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] To the first model. With the hope that we will quickly hear its music. [heels clicking] Will this entertainment last much longer? Your place is here, Martin. You can't leave now. All right, sir. Uh, Mr. Bruckmann. I don't understand this, uh... I knew your father at the French front in 1916. - A true Essenbeck. And a heroic officer. - I know. The General Staff is quite firm on this point. Either Röhm goes or we go. It's naked extortion. The SA has a knife at the throat of high finance, not to mention the Reichswehr. Consequently, it will be necessary to stop the flow of heavy artillery into the barracks of the SA. Is that your personal opinion? It is the opinion of the General Staff. And also of the chancellor, if you don't mind my saying so. The army is the army, and the SA is the SA. We are not concerned with internal order. And we will not divide our traditional duties with others. Traditional duties? I'd like to know where the Prussian generals were when we cleaned up Germany from top to bottom. This country will never be clean enough... I beg your pardon! Gentlemen. No one doubts the merits of the attack formations, dear cousin. We ourselves would not be here without the work of the SA. But heavy arms are not needed for public order. All you have to do is look around. Germany is the most orderly country in the whole world. It's a pleasure for the American and English tourists. What more do you want? And so, gentlemen, we're all agreed. Not one single machine gun leaves this place unless it is requested by the General Staff. We are close to the elections, Friedrich, and we must win them at all costs if we want them to be the last. But you know that takes a lot of money. Essenbeck is late. Joachim's stubborn hostility has created this disagreeable state of affairs. All the other industrialists have paid their quota while you... It is... it is difficult to set aside such a large sum of money without juggling the balance sheets. This is a corporation and, as you well know, Konstantin can be... a problem. If Konstantin wants to become a problem, well then, I say that a problem always can be resolved. Don't you think so? "The state cannot but crush the innocent little flower - if the flower obstructs its path." - I am not the state. I've done everything I was required to do and I will involve myself no further. Oh, come on now. [chuckles] Don't take me up on every word. They are words of Hegel, you know? He'd turn over in his grave at the idea of Konstantin being compared to his innocent little flower. Don't you think I could go? It's late. - Yes, go, Martin. - Thank you. Goodbye. You will answer for everything that may happen here. Remember that.

I don't want to be involved in it. I only want you not to drag our institute in this mess. And then I can't believe, I... Hmm.

I don't know anything. What do you want? Look, the house is full of gifts. Expensive things. [breathing nervously] I don't know anything. I don't know anything. [man] When I heard that it concerned the Baron von Essenbeck, I took the liberty of calling you. Otherwise, I'd never have dared. As you can see, sir, I haven't forgotten all the things you have done for me. There's no formal charge yet. Only the usual evidence from the family and a name spoken in delirium by the poor victim. By the child, I mean. Nothing else. Nevertheless, the young Baron was seen coming out of a club. One of those clubs, you know. On Graffenstrasse. I'll take care of it. [chuckles] Take her to the police. - [grunts] - I don't want to go to the police! Get out of here! I don't want to go! I don't want to go! {Screaming} -[man] Shut up! - [door opens, closes] - [footsteps approaching] Read this. It's incredible. [Friedrich sighs] [nervous chuckle] - What does it mean? - That's what I want to know. When has Martin ever shown this kind of initiative? To call "an extraordinary meeting of the board of directors." Of course, he is the major shareholder, Sophie. He can do as he pleases. But why does he want to call a meeting of the board of directors? - We'll know soon enough. - Hmm. - Do you know where he is? - No. I've been looking for him. He can't be found, Sophie. He was last seen in a bar in Dusseldorf, three days ago. - [clicks tongue] - Now they've lost all track of him. He must be found. We'll turn Germany upside down if necessary. [clicks tongue] - But the president... - The president is not here. In his absence, you will do as I tell you. But we have received direct orders that do not... I assume every responsibility. The whole shipment must be diverted to Stuttgart. And delivered to the area SA command. You understand? [phone ringing] Hello? [hangs up phone] What's happening, Friedrich? What's happening? - It's all right, don't worry. Don't worry. - [sobs] We'll find him. We shall find him. We've got half the city looking for him. [sighs, sobs] [Sophie sighs] Try Aschenbach again. - It's too early. - It's almost three. You can always try! [sighs] [dialing] [sobbing] Hauptsturmführer Aschenbach. It's urgent. [sighs] Friedrich. Friedrich. Friedrich. Bruckmann. Friedrich Bruckmann. From the castle at Kleistburg. Uh... Yes, yes, I'll wait. [door squeaks] [loud clatter] - Martin? - [breathing heavily] What are you afraid of? Answer me. Why does Konstantin keep you in here? What does he want from you? What have you promised him? Martin. - Konstantin. - What happened, Martin, what happened? I'm afraid. I'm in his hands. - No, Martin, no. - |'m afraid. No. No. No. I'll help you. - But tell me everything. Everything. - No. I must know everything in order to help you. Tell me! - Martin, Martin. - No. Speak, Martin, speak. Is he the one who made you write that letter? No. No! Is he the one who made you write that letter? [screaming] No! [crying] I'll take care of it, dear. - [crying continues] - Your mother will protect you. Then the moment has come to crush the innocent little flower, because the flower obstructs our path. I have already preannounced to Friedrich a similar occurrence. But Friedrich has not developed well his sense of the Hegelian system. When is the board of directors meeting? Within a month, according to the bylaws. And what will be the procedure? Very simple. Konstantin will ask for verification of the powers. There will be a vote. Martin, who has the major stock, will withdraw his support from Friedrich, and... Will pass it on to Konstantin. But... how did Konstantin get his hands on Martin? He has many friends in the police, SA, even the Gestapo. Another cord to cut. Very soon, however, the files regarding Martin will pass into... [chuckling] more important hands. Come. [clicks heels] These are the most complete archives ever to be conceived. This is the secret Germany. Nothing is lacking. You can even find your history and Friedrich's. Can you believe it? You see, it's not very difficult to enter... into the lives of people. Every German citizen, today, is potentially one of our informers. The collective thinking of our people is now complicity. Don't you think that this is the true miracle of the Third Reich? If you wish, we can read Konstantin's future together. If he has one. Konstantin will always have a future. As long as his friends are in power. If I were you, I wouldn't be so pessimistic. You see, Sophie, if we needed the SA to conquer Germany, to conquer the world... we need the army. But the army wants no part of the SA. The generals have been explicit: "Either us or them." Do you want the chancellor to be displeased with our fine generals? Do you really think that Hitler is willing to put his friend Röhm in the background? In the background? A man like Röhm? That wouldn't be enough, and too much of a risk. Certain things are not done halfway. [chuckles] Konstantin is your risk, as much as ours. For you, it would be easy. No, Cousin Sophie, that is not so. It's nice of you to try to save Friedrich from such a... hmm, distasteful task, but the terms are very clear. We also share the disadvantages of our alliance. Friedrich will do what must be done. But I would like you to help me never to expose him to this sort of thing again. What do you mean? I would like you to help to transform the Essenbeck corporation from a family enterprise to a company with a sole owner. And since Friedrich's name is not Essenbeck... - It's impossible. - Nothing is impossible in this country. A decree is sufficient. And Friedrich would be able to obtain the name and the title of Essenbeck. Don't you think you are demanding too much? You are also demanding. [chuckles] You know the hostility that still interferes with our marriage. Oh. Yours is a beautiful love story... Sophie. An exemplary story. But I don't see how it is directly connected with the life of the Third Reich. It's not just a love story. To wage war, they want cannons. They won't have enough without the Essenbeck steelworks. Watch out, Cousin Aschenbach. In this negotiation, I don't have less of an argument than you have. [chuckling] What made you suddenly become such a miser with concessions? - That's not difficult to answer. - [chuckling] In every question of power, always an alternative is necessary, even hypothetical. It's the first rule in the art of governing. Enough, I understand. That means it doesn't seem practical to put everything in Friedrich's hands. Even that which is Martin's. [chuckles] He's your son, Sophie. Must I always be the one to remind you of that? I can't believe it's possible. - When? - Soon, Friedrich. [chuckles] Much sooner than you think. - And Aschenbach? - [scoffs] Aschenbach is against it. [chuckles] But what does that mean? He, too, will find himself faced with a fait accompli. [clicks tongue] But can't you understand that you count more than he does by now? Aschenbach produces words. You produce cannons. It's the one thing that carries weight, believe me, above all, to the Chancellery. The decree, Friedrich. Don't you think so? Friedrich von Essenbeck. [both chuckling] [Sophie moans, giggles] Ah, power. All the power or nothing. Remember? Then we'll get married, Friedrich. Very soon. You and I together forever. - And Martin? - [chuckles] Martin has never been a problem. And Konstantin... has he never been a problem? You have to do it. It's your move. Oh, God. [gasps] I am not afraid, Sophie, I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid. Joachim, Konstantin... and tomorrow? God, the complicity grows. And I know I'll... [sobbing] I'll be trapped with Aschenbach all my life. When you are at the peak of the pyramid, not even Aschenbach will have power over you. Oh, my God. I've accepted a ruthless logic... and I can never get away from it. Oh, Sophie. When? Aschenbach will tell you where and when. BAD WIESSEE WELCOMES THE SA - [chattering in German] - [brakes squeak] [in German] I've not been in Wiessee since Munich. Those were bad days. Now we're fine. Don't you agree? When I think of Munich, I remember a putsch, a whore and a flea-ridden cell. Me too. The putsch and the cell must have been the same. - And I bet it was the same whore. - [all laughing] - Take aim! - [man laughing] Fire! [cheering] [SA soldiers singing in German] [in German] Nothing happens to the old one. [all laughing] Today, it's Hindenburg. And tomorrow, maybe the chancellor. That's a wonderful idea. He gets on my nerves anyway. [cheering, shouting] [cheering continues] [Speaking German] Halt, this is the boss. He arrives by car because he gets sick on the train. [all laughing] [all] Heil! Heil! [shouting, laughing] [chattering, laughing] [singing in German] Do you see it, friends? Don't you see it? [singing continues] [Bavarian music playing] [Bavarian music continues] [Speaking German] [cheering, whistling] [Bavarian music, cheering continues] [music stops] - [chattering] - [laughing] - [music resumes] - [cheering] Raise the flag The ranks are tightly closed [music stops] The SA marches on With firm and steady step Our fallen comrades Brought down By the Red Front and Reactionaries March on in spirit amidst our ranks Our fallen comrades Brought down By the Red Front and Reactionaries March on in spirit amidst our ranks Now clear the streets For the brown battalions Now clear the streets For the men of the storm division Upon the swastika Millions now look with hope Their day of freedom and plenty Soon will dawn - Drink, drink, brother, drink - [clapping hands] And leave all your worries at home - [speaking in German] - Drink, drink, brothel; drink And leave all your worries at home Forget all of your worries Forget all of your woes Be happy, be carefree - [woman screaming] - [cheering] [cheering continues] [man] There is no place... There is no place where I dare let my tears flow but here. O, by all, Roderich, that you and I hope and expect from heaven, do not cast me out from this place. [laughing] I have no one, no one upon this wide earth. No one upon this wide earth. [continues laughing] [coughs] Röhm would be a fool to be let down by Hitler. Nonsense. How can you say that? They're bosom buddies. What do you think? Nonsense! I can only tell you that if he doesn't stop making difficulties for us, - only his mustache will remain. - [laughs] We've brought him to the position he now holds. He wants to chase us off to impress the Wehrmacht. What do you think? How long will these nice holidays last? We will stay here until they have agreed. And if they do not agree? - Then there's going to be some shooting. - Shooting... What else should we do? Let's go in, or you'll be missing the best. - Come on! - There will be some shooting! [laughing] - [piano plays cancan music] - [screaming, laughing] [laughing, cheering] [shouting, cheering] - [piano stops playing] - [laughing, shouting] [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] [all singing] The rotting bones are trembling Of the world before the war We have routed this scourge And won yet another victory And we will go on marching Though the world to pieces falls For Germany hears us today And tomorrow the entire world And we will go on marching Though the world to pieces falls And though from war and battle The whole world should lie in ruin For us, the devil may care We'll build it right back up And we will go on marching Though the world to pieces falls For Germany hears us today And tomorrow the entire world And we will go on marching Though the world to pieces falls For Germany hears us today And tomorrow the entire world [whistling] [laughing] [laughing continues] - Good night! Sleep well. - Let's go now. - [singing continues] - [shouting] Ah! [chuckles] -How he sweetly -[piano playing] Opens his eyes Do you see it, friends? Don't you see it? Lighter and lighter He is illuminated Bathed in stars And lifted high Don't you see it? Don't you see it? Don't you see it? - [piano stops] - [man laughing] [motorcycles approaching, faint] [boat engine running] [engine shuts off] Don't be foolish. Put the gun down! [no audible dialogue] [machine guns firing] - [screaming] - [Speaking German] - [shouting, screaming] - [machine guns firing] [screaming, shouting continue] [machine guns continue] All dead. Let's go! No! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! [machine guns firing] No! - [screaming continues] - [machine guns firing] Let's go! Go! [shouting] - [screaming] - [machine gun firing] Is... Is that- [machine gun fires] [machine guns continue] [Martin in English] I realized immediately what she was about to do. I understood. I don't know why, but I understood. I did not move. I did nothing to stop her. I sat in Olga's room without moving a finger. There was a deathly silence all around. And when night came, I stayed there... waiting. Waiting. Calm yourself, I didn't bring you here to blackmail you. Konstantin has already tried. It didn't bring him any luck. And that put you in real trouble, you, the son of a hero — The true hero, the only von Essenbeck. Just because a little Jewess... had the bad taste to hang herself. Didn't you know? Jew. According to the new order, yours isn't even a crime. In fact, it's... But that's not enough to say we are friends or allies. Allies? If you wish. -I thought that you and Friedrich — -I thought so, too. Until yesterday. Friedrich thinks he's become irreplaceable. [scoffs] But he's mistaken. Only he who acknowledges he can lose from one day to the next everything he might've gained thanks to our support, that, yes, is a trustworthy friend. But he who wants to become master of all, even of himself, who deludes himself into thinking he's able to make his own decisions, to think... by himself, that, no. You don't have these... pretensions. Right, Martin? But isn't it too late? The decree? The decree? Certainly that piece of paper has got a tremendous value, as long as the receiver is in a position to enjoy it. They are using National Socialism as an instrument for their own ambitions. They still don't understand what National Socialism really is. But they've already cut me out. Friedrich can appoint his own successor. As far as I know, Friedrich has no sons... yet. Your mother, on the other hand, has one. You, Martin. It would be so easy. But if you're afraid... I'm not afraid. I've waited years for this. I don't say afraid of Friedrich, but of your mother. I could do anything to destroy her security, her strength and her power. Anything. I was always kept apart. She only wanted to humiliate me. She never realized that I loved her and needed her. And I really did. But now all that changed to hate. I hate her. [scoffs] Very simple. I want to see her weak, ruined... and alone. Help me, please. I'll do what you say. I'll do anything. Anything to accomplish this. Yes, Martin. I will help you. I won't give them any peace. [fork clatters loudly] Gunther, pay a little attention. Uncle Friedrich has something to say. I bet that you're now going to tell us the date of the wedding. - I shall try not to miss it. - You won't miss it, Martin. Neither will any of the others. You mean the ones who remain? I assumed total responsibility not only of the steelworks, but of this entire family. And therefore, I intend to stop this habit of taking liberties. Excuse me, Friedrich. You don't mean to include me amongst your subjects. I'm simply a guest. Oh, no, no, dear cousin. I wouldn't dare. -But if you're a little patient, you can — -Excuse me. Gunther! - I haven't finished yet. - They're not problems which concern me. They concern you because you live in this house. [Gunther] I didn't ask to stay. - And I won't stay very much longer. - I order you! Get back into your place. [sighs] At least this can be a moment for truth. Neither one of you condescended to come to the opening of the new steelworks. For one reason or another, you decided to miss a most important family obligation. - [snaps fingers] - Your absence was conspicuous to me. And I insist that this kind of behavior never happens again! What is the meaning of all this control? The, uh, impromptu visits, the secrecy, the spying. The investigations carried out by the secret service against some of my most trusted colleagues. What is all this? For some time, the works have seemed to be besieged, and I know very well that none of this could have taken place without your full knowledge. So what is it? I assure you... that no one will leave this room until all that has to be said is said. [door opens] - [footsteps approaching] - [floorboards creaking] Can I sit down? I was sitting here that night. I don't have much to say. Elisabeth and the children took the train to Salzburg on the morning of June eighteenth. They never arrived. You know where they were taken? Not even you? They took them where you decided. To Dachau. To the internment camp. I know you didn't mean any harm to any of them. You just wanted to compel me to return. In the interests of justice, of course. And the steelworks. And to get rid of anyone who one day might say, "Yes, it's true, it was Herbert's gun that killed Joachim von Essenbeck... but the hand was another's." [shouting] What do you want? Nothing. You have succeeded with your plan. I have returned to give myself up to the Gestapo. In exchange, they will release the children. They won't talk. They can't harm you. And Elisabeth won't talk. - She's dead. - It's not true. It is, Gunther. Someone has to know and remember. And tell the others, because they also must know, and remember. Uncle Herbert! Wait for me. Gunther, where are you going? Gunther? Gunther. Stop. Where are you going? Idiot. You haven't heard the best yet. - Idiot! - [Sophie] Martin! Come with me. Come. Come with me. Look at him. It's he who killed your father. He! With his own hands. Don't you believe it? Why don't you ask him? Tell him! How many shots did you fire? One, two, three? Oh, you can tell him now. Who could prove it? Why did you do it? Why did you do it? Why? Because Friedrich said that we had to say everything that needed to be said. I cooperated. Isn't that what you wanted? The sole owner. I'll make you pay for that, you little swine. But don't you understand that something's changing in this house? I'm not afraid of you anymore, Friedrich. And even if it seems paradoxical to you, if anyone should be afraid among us, it's you from now on. And you, too, Mother. What do you want of Friedrich? - Everything. - You're crazy, Martin. I want everything, Mother. And I'll take everything. Everything that belongs to me. I won't let you. - Mother! - Ask my pardon. - Kneel and ask my pardon! - Ow! Mother! Kneel and ask my pardon on your knees. Kneel. No, Martin. No, no, no! - No, on your knees. On your knees. - [indistinct] [crying] [crying] Tomorrow, Martin will repent, you'll see. He'll ask my pardon. - He'll repent. - Shh. [Sophie cries] It's okay. Come on. Come on. [crying continues] Gunther. I will kill them. If you want, I will kill them. [Aschenbach] You see, Gunther, you, tonight... have acquired something truly extraordinary. The brutality of your father, Friedrich's ambition, even the ruthlessness of Martin. But all that is nothing compared to what you already possess. Hate, Gunther. You possess hate. It's a young hate. Pure. Absolute. But be careful. This potential of energy and fury is too important to use it in a paltry, private vendetta. It would be a luxury. A useless waste. To destroy Friedrich, the venomous bite of an asp is enough. You will come with me, Gunther. We will teach you to administer your immense wealth. To invest it in a better way. You understand, don't you? Come. Gunther. Come. [no audible dialogue] [objects clattering] [soft whimper] Martin, what are you doing here? Martin. What are you doing here? Go away, Mother. - Go away. Please. - [syringe clatters] It's he who sends you. Why do you hate him so? And me? Do you also hate your mother? Go away, Mother. Please, go away. Please. [laughing] [sobbing] You don't know the risk you are running by putting yourself in... into Aschenbach's hands. How can you have faith in him? Should I have faith in you? Listen, Martin. You listen, Mother. It's not Aschenbach who makes me afraid. It's not Friedrich. It's you, Mother. You who's always been my nightmare. You with your oppression, with your will to subjugate me at all costs. In every way. With your idiotic wigs and lipsticks. [sighs] You've never loved me. You have always preferred him. You gave him everything. Everything that belongs to me. My factory, my money, my house... brick by brick. Even my name. And your love. You're the worst. So it's you I hate! [crying] Ah, you can't imagine the evil I wish you. I will destroy you, Mother. Martin. [thud] Martin! [screaming] No! [crying] [sniffles] [sighs] [sniffles, moans] [dogs panting] [chattering in German] Sophie. Sophie, we must do something. We-We can't stay inside. Isolated. Prisoners in our own house. Hunted just as Aschenbach wanted us to be. - [Sophie crying] - Sophie. I will not be destroyed in this way. I... Sophie. I've learned to kill. The game isn't over yet. And I'll go to the very end. But you must want it too. You must help me. I will not let Martin strip... I won't let Martin strip me of all the things I have gained. I can still break him. I only need you. - [sobs] - Sophie, I only need you. [sniffles, sobs] - Sophie. - [sniffles, sobs] I need you. Sophie! I need you! [faltering voice] Don't abandon me now! [Martin sobbing] I beg of you. Don't abandon me now. [sobbing] Not you too. I... [knocking on door] [no audible dialogue] MOMMY AND MARTIN [brakes squeal] [brakes squeal] - [brakes squeal] - [doors opening, closing] [indistinct] [door closes] I brought some of my friends with me. Otherwise, what kind of celebration would it be? [plane flying overhead in the distance] You seem depressed. And it's your wedding day... Friedrich von Essenbeck. [opens drawer] Thank you. Thank you very much. It's just a piece of paper, Friedrich. You were wrong to place so much importance to it. These days, decrees are very unreliable. Aschenbach said that you haven't understood anything of National Socialism. And yet it's not a very difficult thing. Even I have understood it. Now hurry up, Friedrich. Mother is waiting. [door closes] [pearls rattling] ["Nachts ging das Telefon" playing] [indistinct] Come on. Light the candles. [Martin humming] Come on. Come on. [glass breaks] [music continues, faint] [music ends] [chattering] [man] Do you claim to be of the Aryan race? - Yes. - Yes. Do any hereditary diseases exist in your family? - No. - No. [snaps fingers] [cork pops] [chattering] Uh, thank you for coming. Thank you. [door closes] [light clatter] ["Nachts ging das Telefon" resumes playing] - [Speaking German] - [Speaking German] [music continues] [music continues] [music ends] [clicks heels] [heavy machinery rumbling]
