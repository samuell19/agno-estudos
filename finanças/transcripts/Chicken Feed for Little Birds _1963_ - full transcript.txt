CHICKEN FEED FOR LITTLE BIRDS You want me to help you? - Lucie? - Mmmm? You think he's going to give you the money? There's no doubt about it. Lucie, you swear to me, that between him and you... Oh, not that! I've told you, it's "Platonic”. He came one evening, to the dive, he wanted to drown his sorrows. When he saw me, he cried out "Marguerite”. She's the daughter he lost. It seems as if I'm her double. "Marguerite”, he said, “It's you, I've found you." She died at 20 years old, of a lung infection, in springtime. What shall I wear? Sometimes, like today, we have dinner, and he looks at me. At his age, it's all he can do. He talks to me like I was Marguerite. It's hard, seeing an industrialist weep. You called him "general”. So? They have captains of industry, they ought to have generals, he is a general of industry. That's with the money he has. Ah, my 'Nato, I can see us already, You, in the car, me, with a brand new hat. We arrive, you take me by the hand, I have a lump in the throat. Your mother looks at me and opens her arms. What does she say? "Figlia mia!" - Oh, "mamma'! Suddenly, I'll have a family, me whose never had one. And for the benzine? "The benzine"? What's benzine? The petrol, for the car. You think of everything! I'll ask him for 300 notes. Renato, tell me that you love me, in Italian. "Ti amo". "Ti amo tanto, tanto.” It's unbelievable the affect that has on me. Renato... Oh! 12.30! I don't have time. I must go, I'm going to be late. Ciao, cheri, Ciao. Ciao! Buy what an idiot. What an idiot! Hello, everyone! Hello, Mme Antoinette. Hello, Mme Lucie! You want your cut of spider steak? Keep it for me for this evening. It's reserved. Until later! The concierge is upstairs. Concierge? Concierge? What is it? Mr Guylain de Fleurville? Third on the right. Of course, I've forgotten my dustpan again. And hup! He'll never look under there. Coming! Coming, coming! Yes? A pneumatic. "A pneumatic”! Thank you. My word! You'd think we were in Sing Sing. He can't give you any money. You want to see my accounts? And pick your feet up, you'll scuff my polish. It's me, Mme Communal, Mlle Pain. And for Mr. Lodet, what do you do for him? He doesn't eat there, I just do the dusting. Have I told you about his poor aunt? The one who gave him everything? 300 times. She was 15 years younger than me. Well, she died first! To annoy me, you'll live to be 120. 94... Paralysed, my poor head is going to... I haven't got that long to live. Stop talking such nonsense and eat. Communal, the napkin! These days, it's impossible to get good service! It's just as well I love you. You love me, Communal? Really? You will never let me go into the hospice? Here you go with this again. It's the poor who go into the hospice. It's terrible, to be old and poor. But I'm not poor, oh no! We know, you have a nest egg. You won't find it! I haven't looked. Oh! Such a bad temper! Well, despite my flaws, on my death, you will not be forgotten! Eat it while it's hot, instead of all this chatter. Sir has eaten well? The chicken curry was good? Revolting. But the place is convenient, and then there"s the view. Oh, sir, what will Madame think? Nothing. Mostly she doesn't think. - 1 have to get going! - Scram. Eh? If you have to scram, then scram. Don't get angry, we were here to talk. You're not here for the conversation. Every Tuesday, and never the same. Where does he find them? Where indeed? Count the money. Albert, the door. - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. Goodbye, madame. Goodbye, sir. And bingo! Off to 6 in the next street. To Mme Josepha's? You think? It's why he eats here, it's close by. It seems like it's a bit of a luxury! Ice creams before bedtime... "Before bedtime"? With Albert, I prefer the lights out. Sodol. What did you say? Okay, mistress, leave. 2 bundles for the room, 4 for the plonk, 1 for the Jap, and the service isn't even any good. Why are you looking at me like that? You like it? The arched back, the buttock near the ground... You're looking more and more like a maid. Get a move on, eh? - Louis? - Yes? I'm afraid. - Stop joking. - No, not with you. You're a pussycat, a dreamboat! He won't believe me. What are you squawking about? Yes, the appearances are against me. The real ones will have paid before. Are you ready, my chicken? At once. - Louis? - Yes. You know that daddy is unwell? He's not getting better? Oh no, it's getting worse. If that's so, I'll have to go to La Villette. I'm worried about my dad, and you talk about slaughterhouses. It's for Antoinette. "Antoinette”! It was myself I gave! Oh, you can talk! You have your Italian. He doesn"t count, Renato, I'm his victim, if you knew him, he terrorises me. I want to leave him. The knife, the razor, the navaja, that's what it's like with the Italians. Loulou, tell me that for you, I'm just a caprice, a fantasy of commerce. Oh no! Then help me, Louis... - With Renato? - No, with daddy. Tell me as we're going down. I know that if you have any heart, you'd like him, my papa. Alone in la Creuse, retired after a life of toil. He has a pension... Minuscule! We have a government that fires rockets we all have to pay for. - What did he do? - Who? Your father. Ah, but I've already told you... - Locomotive. - Eh? At least, I mean to say, he drove them. It's hard work, have you never seen, at the cinema? They go out in the fog, coal in the engine, shovelling here, shovelling there, tunnel ahead, precipice... With that regime, it was fatal. He was never going to stand it. - But what did he do? - The coal! It was terrible. Mine isn't, amid the cattle? And on the railroad! I know him, my father went everywhere. He'll die, if something isn't done. And me, his only and favourite daughter, there's nothing I can do. He's in the hospital! "In the hospital”, my father? Never. And the draft that he has in his little house... He can't pay to fix it because he isn't working. Louis, give me 300,000F. 300,000 smackers? No, are you crazy, you... Well, I say, you've got some nerve, you. Finished in 7. You're not going to let papa die? I don't have it. It's Antoinette that holds the stash. You know her! Good. I know her, and I thought I knew you. Don't stop there. I don't believe it, for papa, it's a matter of life and death! 300,000F, what is it to you? 200kg of rumpsteak. He values my father in kilos! I'm getting more like you? Loulou, so then, it's no? But I can't, I've told you. You want a lift? Suit yourself. Don't fret too much. He'll get better. There is fresh air, in la Creuse. Is that the best you can offer? When shall we meet again? Meet again? Never! Don't mouth off like that here! Butcher! Assassin! Satyr! Debaucher of young girls! I've take them, mine, at the same age... my boot would make them dance. The twist, You're not in step. - And he is? - Yes, he is. I should have his rhythm, like Jojo! You can see, it's not dancing cheek-to-cheek, it's more like calisthenics. That's "dancing™? Words these days... Give me another. Bravo, Jojo! "Bravo" for the false notes? Don't bug him, it's his debut. Leave it. It'll be different when I'm famous. What name will you take? "Jo and his gang."” I'll have lots of cars, with girls inside. Say, get off your cars, it's your boss doing all the work. Oh, shit! Already? Wait, madame Antoinette, I'm coming! I'm so sorry. There's no harm done. So, have you made some progress? I haven't had the time. Plus I need an electric. You must save up for one. I do, but... Pardon. There's no harm done. Thanks for asking. My husband doesn't like jazz, but I do. It's rather funny, considering your age. And for 3 cutlets with walnuts for Mme Moreau who'll be collecting them. Louis, will you take a joint of beef to Mlle Ferber? It's for her father, he's ill. It's not because of the coal, eh? "Coal"? Yes... I know what I mean. And isn't it me who's going to cut this? Troubles? Has meat gone up again? Like you say, yes, she's put up the meat. It's good quality, of course, fresh and tender... of course, a piece of prime, as they call it, of course! But this goes too far! There's a limit to everything. Hello, Mme Jourdan, what can we get you? A small shoulder? A small shoulder... Very amiable, the owner, too much so. I hope that he won't look past the surface. The concierge is in the shower room. Never there, the bitch. - Pardon me! - Pardon, sir! You've been told a hundred times not to slide down the bannister. » They are beautiful on the mountain » The feet of your cherubs ? "They cry out, but nobody comes to deliver them.” Psalm 18, verse 42. You can spend your evenings distributing this literature, but I waive you from the need to slip these under my doormat. There you are, tiger. It's a long time since I last saw you. Mr Clair, this building is a suitable building, occupied by suitable people. Certainly, sir, certainly. It's not Noah's Ark. All these animals you allow in the house... The house built by the rich is like those with ringworm. He goes to bed rich, and it is for the last time... What are you trying to say? Do you know something? Ask the birds of the skies, and they will answer you. It's in "Job". You'll find yourself in deep do-do if this continues, you have been warned. Don't worry, I have to watch what he gets up to, and afterwards, I'll give you your food. Greetings, sparrows! You'll have to wait for your pasta. The concierge wasn't in her hole. You've had your dust bath, you, now I'll have to wash your feet. 6 weeks tomorrow, we join the big league, we'll be able to have watercress. You don't look well and are keeping quiet. I see what's up. Tonight, castor oil. Oh! Pardon, sir, madame. Is it okay to give this? Perhaps not to bad subjects... Mecton, you're great. You'd win me a 100 points in a contest, if I could take you. Only, here, I can't. We never know. Your scandalous ride is not to tomorrow, Feignant! Here, come experience the life of a youngster. Show him a little of what it is to be a boss. You might knock. Letters from travel agencies, are we going to the Cote d'Azur? I'm going to get some spinach to go with the pasta. I was in the shower room. I blame you. For being cleanly? For never being in your lodge. Oh really? My neat profile didn't displease you, that day you had heatstroke, I had to slap you. Madame Communal... Notice, I never told anyone. I'm never there? It's like a revolving door down there. Are you afraid someobody's going to steal your sparrows? At night, nobody who enters has to give their name. The door is going to be locked at 9pm. At 9pm? In June? Precisely because we are in June. What's more, in June... What are you looking at? Shush! Listen to that, the cry of the rain forest. It sounds more like a dripping tap. Get the hell out of here! I'm as good as any man and in a crisis here, I am the concierge, but I'm still a woman. And as that woman and concierge, there is a tone I won't allow! You're out-of-date, Mr. Lodet, it's over, the concierges of yesteryear! There's no denying it, you're a champion. And you? You heard all that and you just sit there? You couldn't let one out, eh? Good, we'll try something else. Rest yourself, papa, I'm going to get you a treat. A little birdseed and niger. A spot of listening and repeating. Doesn't it inspire you? Let's try again. Why aren't I blessed with good health? I could work and I could buy the car. I can't do anything! The heart! The heart! And you were sure that you'd have the money. Yesterday he was going to give it to me. Only, at noon, the stock market ruined him, not a penny, nothing. He wanted to kill himself, I managed to prevent it. That and the death of Marguerite, it was too much to bear, poor thing. Stronza. What is it this time? Overcooked, every time it's overcooked! Ah, mamma mia... Your pasta, your delicious pasta! She should have taught you how to cook fettuccine. She will teach me, as we"ll be going. I assure you, we'll have the car. No, it's too late. Yes, we'll have it, I'll do anything for it. 'Nato, write to your mother, tell her that we"ll be a little late. She won't believe it, we told her we already had the money. I have it, we can send it to her. When she sees this, think how happy she'll be. Ah, Lucie, thank you on behalf of the family. Lucie, how good you are. "God Loves You". At 9pm! What's this all about? Nothing, doors don't exist for him, he"ll come like a thief. - Who? - But God, you'll see. Ah yes, Him, if he comes, he won't say his name. Youth passes, think of eternal life. "Domani,"” with you, it's always "domani”. I can't wait any longer. First, I need the money. Second, if there's the chance, I have reasons to offload it quickly, special reasons. I've given you my word. Lucie will get the money. That mouse of yours? Don't make me laugh. He's a painter, he's handsome, he repainted the kitchen. One morning, I was in bed, he cried "Mamma" and fell on my bed. Your bed is in your kitchen? No, we were talking. I'll continue... From on top of my bed, he got in. He confide to me: He's sick, he's killing himself to send money to his family. I wanted him to rest, he recovered and we decided to get married at his. Lucky you, married! For this, I need money. There are always complications. Here, on a good night, you sell a packet of gauloises. Oh, I know. Gladys, you remember Maya who used to sing here? The one who used to do the lunch hours, with the prison warders, with their bunches of keys and truncheons? Oh yes! What was she drinking! Do you have her number? Montmartre 64-27. Say, you're not... Oh, we gain nothing without some pain and I want Renato. To succeed in this line, you have to know how to pick your women. Lucie, she'll never be a real winner. Listen, I'm telling you, you mustn't stay with her. Here... this is the sort of woman who can help a man. You look down in the dumps. Homesickness. Ah, Italy, I spent 3 months in Turin. You know Turin? Oh, I was there for the season. As a saleswoman, I didn't see very much. All my family are in Italy, my brother, my mother... You're nice, Maya, I'll explain it to you, tomorrow, 5pm, okay? That's it, my girl, we'll raise a glass. From the terrace, we can see the sea, Vesuvius... When it smokes, it must be spectacular! I called him, he spoke to his friends, I'm seeing him tomorrow. With Lucie, you need never despair. What are you doing there? Go rest and sleep. Go, until later, bye-bye. Ciao. Isn't he handsome, Renato? Isn't he worth a small sacrifice? Yes. What's this illness? The heart. Say, doesn't that trouble him? For? Oh, for that? No, nothing bothers him there. Cigarettes! Shit! That's a good start. Sorry, but I don't have anything. I'm not lying to you. Here, look. From January 1st: 10,000 and 5,000 old Franc notes will no longer be valid. I don't like these little games, they're really stupid. Mademoiselle Pain? My good Communal? A biscuit is missing. What did you say? You've eaten - a biscuit. - What biscuit? Oh, my bit! Don't play around with your Louis. And you, don't make insolent remarks in my home. Paralysed as I am, I'm supposed to get up and cross the room? At this height, I'd have to put on my crampons. - You great fool! - Good, okay. No, it's not okay, not at all, in fact. Don't work yourself up, I was wrong. Can I make you a veal roll? With fresh peas... We're sulking? Good, it will pass. Come in. Mr Clair, I didn't hear, I was praying. Very good. I'm pleased with you. How are you this morning? Oh, not so good... Are you going to read to me? Where were we? Exodus 8, where King Darius is searching for the treasure. He won't find it, the treasure, they never do. She won't find it either, shush. I'm going to sign up. Good, it's what my brother did at 70. I'm going to be a soldier. Bravo! They must take back Alsace and Lorraine. Isn't it done? You think so? With all these wars, you never know what's been taken. If it's taken back, you'll find something else. Here. Read. Read here. "The Song of Songs," it's beautiful. "Ah, let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth,." "His caresses are sweeter than wine." Oh, Mr Lodet, what a surprise! Mademoiselle, please. Paris is strange. We can live in the same area, the same building, and we spend days, months even, without having the joy of meeting. Yes. We don't keep the same hours. I work at night, a very good job. I say it to Renato, he's my husband. An lltalian doesn't like his wife working. I sell cigarettes in an elegant establishment. No, thank you. Please. I love hearing your little birds. It's lovely, it's like the countryside, I love the countryside so much. - Don't you? - No. I do. The air there is good, especially in la Creuse, it seems. The concierge is at the Grocer's. Mlle Lucie, have you seen if the benefits have arrived yet? I doubt she deals with your business. ll wasn't really looking. Well, with a man who works all hours... Returning freezing, he warms himself. And I'm still asleep. So, goodbye, sir. Mademoiselle. Oh... Hello everyone! Hello ladies. You've changed your hairstyle. How are you! I can't hold it in place, I'll have to speak to the hairdresser. I'm finding it the same. I have an appointment, ll must look beautiful. Two chops. Cost: 6F. Who's next? 6F. Hello, handsome blond. How's the rock'n'roll going? Are you here for your spider steak? No, I want some rumpsteak. A nice joint for Mme Lucie. My husband is fed up with spider. There's a spider who's not tired! I beg your pardon? I was joking. There are limits! It's true, Louis. Don't get worked up, it's the way he is. That meat there? 18F, Mme Lucie, a fine joint. 18F for us. What does this feel like? Am I dreaming? This can't be... But yes! Here's what I get for 18F! Me, a loyal customer! The sort of meat that Kills you! Sorry, this is the leftovers we give to the animals. It doesn't exactly give you confidence in the business. Excuse us, we'll change this. The best cut, like for ourselves. Watch out! Meat for the animals. It wasn't me, it was you... What's going on in your head? That music of your savages? You waste 8 years, and instead of friends... You've fallen on the new wave. I know the Corsicans, the Fritzes, the Ricans, the Nordafs, all the real men. But this... at the first sign of trouble, he does a runner. Even the transvestites would be ashamed. No! Ah, shut up, you're pissing me off. Go on, fill me another glass. You're banned from staying here, Victor, watch out. Don't fret. A guy to see, a little business fixed, and goodbye. You were in the Asnieres' hold-up? Ah, she's very good! Who said that? At the time, everyone said lots of things. You must see, 30 big ones, people are going to talk. Between us, we never knew anything. They were champion, both of them. Yeah. You came here for what? The evening of the hold-up... Coincidence... For a petty job, the fencing must be arranged 8 days before. So, for a bank vault, well... We're going, ciao. Ciao, Gaby. Bye. That look! We had a different look. And Marco? In the slammer, 15 banks. Freddy? In Rio, retired. Lucien? Doing 2 years, 10m from here. And Armand? There's someone I'd like to see again. Me too, he's owed me a slate of 50 bags for 8 years. No! You've not seen him since? You had done subterranean work together. That's why we asking ourselves if both of the heists... No, Armand, without saying goodbye, without selling his girls, two little ladies found themselves without protection on Rue Frochot. Perhaps he's dead... Such talk brings bad luck. 3000 new francs, here. For once, they aren't so bad. These don't keep you in one place, they're pratical, when traveling. As you say. The concierge is at the hairdressers. With the egg or the marrow? With the marrow. I should have known. The lady's a butcher. Third on the right. More for Fleurville? It's Sevigne, his chick. A man in love, I think... His editor sent back his love stories. Have you read them? Why? I have my memories, love has used me up. So young, never say never again. Who told you that I say it? A pneumatic. Must be bad news. There's also the good. Nicely said, come in. I'm going to give you something. Will you have a drink? No, I'm not thirsty. Oh, don't pout. There are things that I can't explain, at your age. But a word of advice: Don't get married. Ah, marriage, for the man, it's hell. We can come, sometimes, to regret the war, that's to say. Hey, look who's passing. She's mounted on ball-bearings. You told me to give her that rotten meat. Yes. And I was wrong, she has a sense of smell. And it's a wop that has her running like that. There're enough of them in France. Yes, it's that wop. But where's she going? To make him 300,000. Who with? She insulted me in front of everyone. I could've had them, I'd give them to her, her 300000! Antoinette's a bitch, with her money! She asks 300,0007? Nobody's paying that. What do you know about it? Nothing, it's you who brought it up. Yes, you're right. Today's not going well. I'd do better to go and prepare my beef. You have time. Stay here. Here, beat that bastard thing. There's still one at least who can enjoy the small pleasures. Don't worry, she was delayed. He doesn't like waiting, me neither. And regarding the motor, I can't wait any longer. Here she is. So? Nothing? Nothing of nothing! My word, she's plastered. The police raided the Queen 2 days ago. I always get there too late. Who's the Queen? It's the boss. Oh, you know, she informed on her friends, two senators and a former President of the Council. They've all gone away with Maya. Tallyho, all in the nick! And they're throwing the book at them, because of Antoinette. Oh, hey, say something! You're not angry, eh? It'll all be okay, you'll see, with little Lucie, it all always turns out okay. Is it troubling you? - Your heart? - A little. That must have hurt you. Yes, terribly. Eric, two scotches on my tab. He doesn't know Lucie drinks. Sometimes, we make our lives with people about whom we know nothing. Then, when we learn, it's too late. Yes, it's too late. It's tough, but there it is. I don't want to bad mouth a friend, but can you imagine her at your mother's spilling chianti everywhere? I regret it, it's an excellent singer. You are great with canaries, Mr. Lodet. Yes, yes, great with canaries. And the Harz? I'll call you. Place de la Contrescarpe? Yes. I'm relying on you. Where's there a bank around here? - Rue de Rivoli. - Thanks. Goodbye, Mr. Lodet. Always at your service. You're a real cordon bleu, Communal. I have my specialites. And what "specialities”! Your puff pastry, for example, it has a lightness, a breath, we don't feel it in the stomach. - Communal, my good... - Yes? Would you make me a strawberry tart? At the price they are? I love strawberry tarts. With what life has to offer me, I'd be better off up there. At least I wouldn't be troubling anyone. Don't cry, you know very well that I'll make it for you. - When? - When I have the time. At my age, who's to know if I'll be here tomorrow? So are you saying, you want it for tonight? Would you? I can do you this or the other thing... Madame Communal, Madame Communal! Here, here, no need to wake up the neighbourhood. Eh... Communal, that's definite, eh, for tonight? Yes. On top, you'll put a little Chantilly cream? A Himalaya! Madame Communal! She is not at your orders, but she will find your spinach, for those poor little beasts. But you, for your meals, cannot rely on me anymore. Better to have grass with friendship that beef with hatred. Mademoiselle Pain... Cuckoo! It's me... But where are you? I hear you... I've found you. I've brought you a little treat, the caramels you like. You're very kind, Mr Clair. But it's silly of you. Not at all, I've just gotten my... But... but you... you are... My God! My God! My God... you're standing. It's a miracle. Yes, yes, a great miracle. "A miracle"? A miracle! I, unworthy as I am, have seen a miracle with my own eyes. Hosannah! Hosannah... "Hosannah”, that's it, it's the right word. But I don't feel very stable, even so... help me to sit down. But pick up the lid first. I was praying, like you taught me, and then I got a pricking in my legs. A voice said to me: "go to the kitchen." A force propelled me... It's like that. And like in one of your readings, I was not in my bed, but I was walking. You felt bad in the head? I had to take 4 aspirins. Here? Is that where it throbs now? Yes, that's the exact spot. It's the sign. The Spirit has come into you. The Philistines ought to know. Not them, above all. Open the temple, that they may see! Ow! I feel bad... my legs, my poor legs. I feel them going numb, they're returning to how they were before. No, God would not allow you to experience this false joy. It's been witnessed, people who got up and walked and then suddenly... Last year, at Lourdes... At the Papists. But with us, the Huguenots... Shush. The Communal, she has no more religion than a capuchin. If we told her about the miracle and I could no longer walk, she'd tell us what for. The Philistines too. It'll be our secret, until the healing is certain. This is wise, the time will come to reveal the prodigy. Of course. Until then, not a word, not to the Philistinse, nor to Communal. We will be like the tomb, shush. Shush. Didn't I hear something about caramels? Watch out, eh! He has a chill. He spreads the microbes. You've been in a mood, these last 2 days... - Fever? - I don't know. A big guy like him... The big ones are the most fragile. You were bad, at dad's. Yes, and I could have died. He's a sod, your father. Don't insult the dead. Him, he knew how to choose an animal. Look at this meat. Pay attention, when you're buying. I buy what you want to sell, then you complain. Because you don't know how to buy. He taught you, dad. Him, at la Villette, he was like the others. What did they do that you didn't like? They add water when they need to. Why don't you add water? That's the best yet. You are more stingy than your mother! Lose 1000F, you break your heart. I told you the legs needed to be greased, and you said: "No, it's okay like that."” Well, no, it wasn't okay. The proof, here it is. The customers will go elsewhere, to a competitor and that'll mean bankruptcy. Oh, don't say that! Yes, bankruptcy, dishonour. Excuse me. How, in this world as it is, since we have taxes, impositions, pressures, and it's still necessary to grease legs, well, let's grease them! How many will it be? Ah, in the... It's fun, the life and the world of honest folk. Il envy the workers, they don't have our problems. Well? Since I have to do it, how many? Well, say it! 300,000F. - "300,000F"? But it's a crime, it's monstrous! Because they never give anything. Afterwards, it's the compliments, it's the money that we need. With this, she won't lack for money anytime soon. Who's “she"? The fat cow I'm taking to lunch. Moreover, we have to feed her? Well, that's the custom. A little blowout, and then a dessert, the little envelope... cash, no cheque. Yeah, it could be traced. It's best not to. By the way, I have a union meeting, tonight. It's a pain, but... Go, go. Everyone must bear their cross. I'll go the bank somewhen. Oh, my poor Jojo, come on. Hearing all this, how do you expect him to grow up with any morality? Is the tip included? No, sir, thee "tip" is not included. Thank you, it's the thought that counts. Gladys, you haven't seen Renato? Where would I have seen him? What are you insinuating? I was only asking. You want me to take him off your hands? I've got better offers. - Cigarettes. - Here. He stopped coming here about the same time as you. Don't look, beautiful. Thank you, sir. He ripped you off? A job we pulled together, and for 8 years I said nothing, not a word. Besides the point. It's by his vices that we discover the real man. He hasn't any. He doesn't even smoke. Doesn't he even have a passion? Yes, in his room there are always canaries. He sold some... If he's not dead, try your luck. You have nothing to do but stick it to the sparrow seller... Cigars, cigarettes... A large Havana. For her big Loulou. You really have some nerve! Coming to her work to taunt a girl whose father's in agony. "In agony"? Almost, the air of la Creuse isn't helping. Champagne. And he appears in front of me, in my misery, to offer champagne. B.O.F. Sit down, duckie. And say no more cruel words. Lucie, ... your father's life, I have it, here! Loulou, you aren't mocking me? It would be ugly to have to leave at a moment like this. Loulou, I'm distraught, this is madness. You're just sorting them out? What are you playing at? You're not giving it to me? Tomorrow, in our little room... at the same time, we'll resume our little habits. Of course, I'm missing it badly. But for the cash, Loulou, why not tonight? If daddy died tonight... Go on, to his health. To his good health. (Shut up, Sage, ) (Shut up, the bad rich guy will hear.) (Go on, go lie down, go lie down.) Face against the wall, hands in the air. Oh! It's me, Mme Antoinette. It's for Jojo. He's not well, I wanted to take him some grog. He's fine, the boy. You're wrong, I'm going to treat him. Yes, yes... love's a beautiful thing. Who are you to judge, you who may be next? A valiant woman is the crown of her husband. ) Here, give your 16 years 1? » Happiness takes shape » » For your child"s body ?» » Gradually transforms 2 } Come, give your heart, put your hand » 2 In my hand » Open, hurry up and open. » And give your 16 years » Jojo, what an outfit! Sorry, madame, I'm rehearsing. At the Red Cross, they look differently. Drink this, and I'll apply a poultice. Unclothed, in your condition! The height of stupidity. Go on, quick, in bed. Drink. Oh... it was strong. To have more effect. It's having one. Really? Oh yes, I feel it already. You're tickling me. That's ticklish, madame. Yes, funnily enough. Tickle-tickle. You're playful, Mme Antoinette. Jojo, why did you switch it off? It wasn't me, I swear. Then it must be a power cut. Jojo... but what are you doing? Me? Nothing, it's you that... Oh! Well, crikey... Mr. de Fleurville? Third right. Quick to the Bois! Hurry! There won't be any more places on the grass. They slide down the bannister. They have to exert themselves. Oh, you! Here, this'll teach you. Go on! It's always me who gets it! Hello, youngster. Hello, Mr. Armand. Oh, it touches me that you put on that tie I gave you, especially for lunch with this gangster. Don't let yourself be hoodwinked, eh? No, and tomorrow, the change... Oh, I'm sure of it. Go on, move yourself. Take your time, it's the result that counts. Ah, you... here. He won't be smiling so much later. Well, well... Come in, my Jojo, I'll make you some nice kidneys. You don't like them? Yes, madame. Jojo, after last night, when we are alone, you can call me Antoinette, and use "tu", eh? Yes, Antoinette. Only, here, after... I'm sorry, but I don't have to tell you about Mme Lucie... You're concerned like a man who loves a woman that he doesn't want to see duped. Here. You think so? Jojo, you are completely good. I want you to have your electric guitar. Take this. I didn't do it for this, you know. - Has she gone? - Yeah. She intimidates me. It's terrible, not to have a little nest. You're telling me... And when we're in love, it's awful to have these money worries. No more talk about money. I promise, my coquette. Give me those 300 k. The void will be filled. As you wish. Now or later? It makes me so ashamed, you can't know. To think that to save my father, I almost broke our love. Ah, you... Put them in my bag. From hand to hand, I could never accept it. Heck. You don't have them? I checked this morning, ll can't have lost them. They were there, in this pocket. Oh, you, you're kidding me, right? You're the one who's kidding... Then I don't understand it. I've looked everywhere. Antoinette thinks that it's for the meat. You and your meat! I'm going vegetarian. What are you doing? I'm leaving. You wanted to swindle my body. Me? You've only ever given me the eye, you never intended to give me the money. You can't believe that? I'm worth more than 300. Get your bloody hands off me. I've washed them. Think of your father. He died yesterday. Then you need money all the more... For the funeral. Get off me, scrapmeat! You hear me? Wait until you see the room. The 5th, it is the Pompadour Square. Lucie, wait! You can't leave me like this. I knew it. Come on, budge up. Where are you going? I'm going where I like. And alone! Oh! Hello, Mr. Lodet. Oh, shit. Sir... Thank you for the privacy. They knew each other, you have to be more careful. They'd only just gone up, I didn't think they'd be leaving yet without having drunk their fill. Keep the change, okay. Thank you, sir. Oh, Mr. Lodet, a great misfortune. Mme Communal came back, she found her. - What? Who? - Mlle Pain. - Ah. - She is dead. Oh. Excuse me. Mme Communal, they tell me... Greetings, Lodet, long time no see. Long... yes, inspector. You know each other? We are old friends, aren't we? So will I have to beat it out of you, or will you confess that you killed her? She was killed? She couldn't walk, she was found in the kitchen, on the floor, like a mop. Not finding that Catholic, I called the fuzz... the police. And the doctor has refused the permit. They're taking her to the morgue. She who loved so much her little comforts. Excuse me. We could talk better in your flat. As you like, it's on the second floor. After you, inspector. It's well maintained, your little building. Landlord, it's fitting. Her soul has escaped, like the bird from the net of the birdcatcher. Yes, yes, okay. - Is he drunk? - Crazy. Ah, I'll have seen him. Death, where is your victory? You have a nice smile, your face is that of the just. I will talk, the day is near. The day is near where I'll have you gutted, I'm warning you. You should have kept a girl, at least to do your housework. You've never had more than two. Oh no, never. You were only ever a minor irritation, nothing more. You were even somewhat amateur. That's not to speak ill of amateurs, when they pull off a big job, it's them that we never catch. Gangster wasn't my vocation. As a young man, I was trained... fell in with bad company, and then it was a slippery slope. Say no more, you'll make me weep. Nice view. How did you afford the place? An old aunt left it to me, with a little cash and the furniture. It's not worth much. An old Dufayel judging by the woodwork. I can tell you about it, I have the same. They belonged to my mother-in-law. So, as soon as you got your inheritance, you quit Pigalle, you took your retirement. Very happily, I felt myself to be misplaced. That's how it is for the cons. Me, I continue to work. In the end, in a bind, I can always send my reference to the Old Cops" Home. It's pratical, your little kitchen. You stole it, the stash? - "The stash™? The old lady's. We haven't found it. So, are you going to open this? It's nothing exciting. It's the room for my birds. It's hard work, but it's my little pleasure. There, that's the corner of the young one... selected, resulting in breeding. Even retired, you have to live off the death of others. It helps me. The rent is not large. Even so, a room just to house sparrows... Is your tenancy on the same terms as those below? Exactly. You aren't losing out? I wanted to sell birds and get some fresh air. You're looking good. Stay here. I'm suspected of what? We found the old lady, and her nest egg has vanished. Come on, Lodet, see you soon. You don't really think it was me? To tell the truth, no. But there will be an inquiry, we will have to go on looking. And you are an ex-con... For 8 eight year, I've lived like a bourgeois, like a veritable monk. Nobody has anything to reproach me for. You'll see. Trust me, I'm going to. Everything went well? More or less, yes. Where did you eat? At Dagorno. It was good, a marrow as starter, 2 good bottles, and for dessert, I gave her the dosh. It's all sorted out. All? Say, it's me you need to sort out. I married you when you had nothing. I had the butchers. Let me explain... A lot of money for a bag of old bones, 300,000F. You'd have been better off with 2000F, if you wanted to fool me. Not that I really care, seeing as for making money, you're a zero. Yes! And you wanted to skim me for 300,000F? Take this! That you've deserved. Now for that other one... Antoinette, no scandal! Think of the shop! You've a nerve! Coming, coming.. Bitch! Homebreaker! My husband not being enough, she takes my money. Here! A few secs and you'll see! Watch your eyes, fatso. She wants to blind me in one eye! Come on, ladies! Don't get involved in that. And she gives us lessons, this one who picked up a housepainter when he was an honest trader. I'm begging you. Stop this! Ow! You'll pay for that! Ah, you want to fight for your fat old man who's not worth diddly squat? Who are you calling bitch? She's hurting me. Who was going up to debauch the shop assistant? Who was it going to Jojo? - You did that? - She's lying. Renato saw it, eh? Yes, it's true. The scrounger saw you, the owner saw you! Ah! I took him up a drink. With her face, she has to get them sozzled. With a shop assistant! You, the boss's wife and girl, acting like a slut! Here! What have you done? I wanted to get married, "General of industry”... and it was the butcher, Lucie, a butcher. Blood, meat! Go pack your bags, before I cut you in half! He did nothing wrong. He can piss off out of here! What will become of you? Don't worry, I'll be a star, with my electric guitar. "Electric guitar”... He has an electric guitar? It was you who bought it for him! Is anyone there? Madame Mourier. What a surprise! What would you like? I have a nice little bit of prime. (The paws!) You promise you've forgiven me? - On the Madonna. - Then don't go. Impossible, I must. While you write to me often? Promise. Where are you going? Well, with you, to the station. To the station? No, Lucie, that would be terrible. You don't want me to? You, on the platform, with a handkerchief... Me, at the window like an immigrant, in 2nd class, in the corridor. No, Lucie. You're not going to stand all the way to Naples. Take 1st class. Thanks very much. What will happen to me, alone, without you? Only until you rejoin me. Yes, as soon as possible. With the car. Ah, no more talk about the car, I'm going. Renato, tell me that you love me, one last time. Yes, I love you very much. I'll be there soon. Good. Arrivederci. Ciao, bambina. Renato! Kiss the family for me. Have you changed butchers? Hello, Mr Lodet, have you been keeping well? I thought I heard some rumpus, yesterday evening. Mme Antoinette wanted to make a scandal. Me, I do everything to pass unnoticed. It all goes to show that one shouldn't become too familiar with shopkeepers. For the last week, I've had nothing but bad luck. And nobody wants to understand me. I could try. Shall we have a drink? You and me, "a drink™? To celebrate this new encounter. What must you think of me? Men have their needs, so must a landlord. But for me to be seen there... So, are we going? If I say yes, you'll think I'm too easy. Oh, I'm starting a new life. Yesterday, I liquidated Louis. And in the evening, I got shot of Renato. He's left for Naples. He should be there by now. It's distinguished, The Prince of Wales. Do you like it? Yes, it's very beautiful. Sold. And I saw your car. Forget about it. - Why? - It's not worthy of us. Your mother is really so ill? No, she's only a little fatigued. Let me go back, SO we can arrive in a real motor. Dressed like a prince. Ah, Gladys! Ti amo tanto, tanto. When is Mr. Lodet going to know that? We'll ask him. He doesn't eat here anymore. As he's robbed me, I'm not making him any more grub. I'm not doing anything for anyone, since her death I don't care. We should talk of the tart. In front of a dead person, what will people think? She would not have had that embolism, without the tart. I only gave her a tiny bit. The doctor didn't say so. Of Course! They can't find the guilty and they want to load this on me. But it's futile. I have my alibi in the cupboard. She ate it, your alibi. She was greedy? Less than an old cat. The thief must have forced her. The nest egg, I'll tell you about that later. And to stuff her face, she didn't need any help. I see, you want to cover up the case. I don't like your tone, chatterbox! "Chatterbox” perhaps, but not an idiot. From there, by herself, how did she come to finish up over there? She couldn't walk at all? Are they deaf, the French police? You tell me! I repeat: She couldn't walk. Stupid woman. This is not the right time. On the contrary, the right time has come. Is he having some sort of breakdown? It's you, you, the just with the nice smile? You, you're going to understand. You, you will spread the news, the great news! She walked. Yes, she walked. Is it true or are you raving? Yes, she walked. I saw it with my own eyes. Yeah. Yes, that's it, old pal. Tell me about it. God had touched her with his finger. You imagine, the poor made rich. The Philistines, the faces they will make! It's not his personal number. It's a cafe on the Contrescarpe. I've had enough. I'll do it myself. Thank you. Those of us with a passion, we must assist each other. Do you also do mating? For the last 8 years, I've had little chance. You must have missed it. Rather, yes. Come on, guys! We're late. No stash. That's the best part. Just a tiny life annuity. You've been played for a sucker, madame. I should have let her go moldy in a hospice. That other simpleton, it was left to him to explain the miracle. The cop has changed his tune, I could have killed him. He also said that you can now get some fresh air. - The inquiry is over? - Yes. Since the money has evaporated, and the weapon was a strawberry pie. Are you preparing a last meal? Will I have to watch the door tonight? I thought I'd told you so. And you'll be going out, to take the air? - Madame Communal. - What? Come and see. The staircase. - What about it? - Take it. Because your life, as concierge of 12 and your questions, I've had it up to here with them. Go on, fatso, scram! To your lodge! I'm going, to my lodge. And let me worry about my weight! You'll see her again soon, your Lucia. There they won't disrespect me. Proprietor, that's better than a butcher, eh? Well... happy? Oh yes. I'd only come to see the little birds. Where are you going? To make our breakfast. I'm starving. Eat at your own place. I'm sleeping a bit more. Ah? Good. I'm going to find it a long time until tonight... Why tonight? I'll come down again. Hang on a minute. Passing an enjoyable moment doesn't mean we must stick together like glue. Yesterday evening, you said... Well, baby, you've passed the age where we believe what was said before. Are we only going to see each other on the staircase? - I'll let you know. - Soon? When I return from my trip. You're going away? (Shush, don't move) (Here. Come, come) Who's there? Police! So, Lodet, will you open up? Coming, just a minute. One moment, I was in bed. Hello, Lodet. I smell you have a good woman here. It's my brillantine. The pimps, they use more scent than their strumpets. The concierge said that the inquiry was closed. It is. However, as I was passing, I thought I'd come up and say hello. May I sit down? Please, inspector. Funny, that old coot whose been bothering us all, did she at least pay your rent? So, can I go on my holiday? Ah, you enjoy the good life. Where are you going? Probably to the South. When one goes to the South, one can get up late... We might almost say that you are in clover. When I see where I am, after a life of work... There's nothing to eat in here. This is for the sparrows. Oh, nice, some chocolates. I live in a small room on a courtyard. So I thought to myself housing for the elderly is free. Two rooms, that's what I need. I'm not asking you for a gift, the current price. For an landlord, having a cop is a form of security. We'll get along fine. Two retirees, cop and yegg putting their feet up. We could talk about it some more or are you worried you must be going? It's that... I have practically promised it. It's funny, the idea came to me while I was making my inquiry into you. Sympathy... You've always interested me, even when you're sitting on your backside. For 8 years, you've behaved yourself, you've not spent heavily. You have even been rather stingy. Yes, but in the end, all that means nothing. I knew two guys live for years with their dad, and then one day, they reappeared in the light, loaded to the gills. They'd pulled a big job before. What big job could I have pulled? I wasn't talking about you in every detail. But as you have always been a crook, what do you expect me to believe? Me? Oh yes, well... I don't know. One day, I must have a closer look at your file. But only out of simple curiosity, don't worry yourself. Shame about the apartment, I never have any luck. But, if I can... You're not going to open it? I've found you, you swine. Who doesn't let his friend in? Aren't you happy to see me? You haven't changed, Victor. I thought you were in a cell. I've done my time, they released me 3 days ago. Let's see your papers. Come on, quicker than this! Your record book. Yeah, it's what I thought... Blackballed. And you're in Paris? With your record, that'll get you far. I was going to check in and I'd left the area, but I'd left without a... And I owe him some money. But I'm not easy to find. That's it, isn't it? Yes. It's taken me a long time. If I had the day spare, I'd go to Melun to secure your removal. You didn't think that I wasn't going to pay you back? No, of course. For 3 days, try to keep out of trouble. It's all about to be sorted, very soon. Eh, Victor? Yes, very soon. We were talking about lack of good luck. Victor never has any. Ah, no biggie. A nice gesture, what. It should please... your landlord. He's my tenant, he lives just below. Scram, and if you don't report in tomorrow, you'll be hearing from me. You should be thankful Wait, I'll give you the chickenfeed. But... like this, now? In your situation, you can't come back. It would not be the best thing. Oh! For 20000, you're running a big risk. 20... 20000? It was 15, but that's okay. Don't thank me. You owe him a great debt of gratitude. Make sure I don't see you again. I'll have you, soon. Yes, write to me... include your address, if you need anything. There's light, trees. When are you leaving? Whenever you like. I'll be going, all the same. They can say what they like, but fraternity, in our milieu, it exists. Buddies are sacred, inspector. Yes. If ll don't see you again, have a good holiday. I'll try. Oh, you scared me. You followed the conversation? No, I fell asleep. I'm so tired. You know that you please me? Really? However, you are wicked. You hurt your Lucie. Forgive me. When I wake up, I tend to be grumpy. Yesterday evning, didn't you say something about a car? A car, me? Ah, the one of the barman's that was too expensive for me? I'll buy it for you and we'll head South. Oh, darling, you've made me so happy. Can you buy it immediately? Well, yes. Wait for me. When will we be leaving? Right away. And my suitcases? We'll buy everything down there. You are in a hurry. I'm sick of Paris and I want to be alone with you. New ones, I've never seen them before. 3pm, Porte-d'ltalie metro station, don't double-cross me. You aren't the only one in this. You think I love you so little? That I could bear not to see you again? Already hooked, eh? You have no idea how much. All the same... Go on, run along. See you soon. Birdbrain. Soon in Cannes... And after... And after, in nature. Life, the real thing. Old twit! And in the service, what's more. My friend, listen. I'm going to alert buddies and the Post Office. It's a terrible mistake. And the Minister of Sport. He knows me, I played rugby. Rugby? Oh, here's why he's so brutal. We are athletes, us, the healthy youth. What's all this yelling about? Why did you run away? And what's with the pagan uniform? Well, the PTT. Take it off at once! Copy me. You are young. Rejoin our ranks. Don't touch me! What is this house of lunatics? I can't take you. Down there, I'll replace you. Are you there or not? Did the inspector tell me the truth? Perfectly. A cop here, his buddies will follow. What will we become here? A police station? - You don't care? - Not at all. Because in a few minutes, I will have left these lodgings. And your critters? I won't... I'll stop off at the sellers. He'll take them. And my wages, my seniority bonus? In the money for the birds. You can send me for the rest. May we know where? General delivery to Cannes, the next 8 days. And then? Then... then, I'll write to you. One last service... go find a taxi, if you'd be so kind. To get shot of you, what wouldn't I do? You'll be shot of me, and forever. Hmm... This is also precious. You've won, Armand. My great darling landlord, who didn't respond when I smiled at him on the staircase. And the registration? In my bag. It's annoying me, your stuff. Can I put it in the back? Leave it, the discs are fragile. I'll never touch them again, your preserved canaries. Say, where are we going to stop to sleep? We're not stopping, I'm eager to get there. Take a nap in the car. You're right, I'm going to dream... Great dreams. Mum, it's me, mum. Poor sweetie! Have you caught a cold? Madame Communal! Madame Communal! Madame Communal! Quick! What's she done? Mum says she"s having the first pains. I'm coming, hurry and tell her. Quick, quick! Escape! Don't be afraid, little flock, people will be saved by the Lord! Sing with joy to the honour of God! Off you go! The day has come! The rivers should clap their hands! The mountains should cry with joy! I'll be back up. It's not happening yet. So you're back from the Post Office? Funny. Off you go! That the heavens may rejoice! He saved Israel from the perils of Egypt, made fall the walls of Jericho. My bonus. Sound the horn, the trumpet! The Lord is freedom! Freedom! Freedom! This time, it's the asylum. This is too big, I'll have to get your change from the office. Oh, this suitcase! And hup! The fleet can have the sparrows! Oh, we're rich, Renato. Rich, rich, rich!
