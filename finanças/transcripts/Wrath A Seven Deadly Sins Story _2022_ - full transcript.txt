If it pleases the court... In front of you is an email from you to Mr. Brooks, dated August 16th of last year. Could you read it aloud, sir? I don't have my reading glasses. That's all right. "Tim, if you think you're going to get one more penny out of me for the Bixacorn hard drives, after I've already laid out two expletive million dollars, you are expletive dreaming. Push this any further and you'll be explaining to the expletive cops how you managed to steal them in the first place." Now, I've omitted a few choice words, but those are your words, sir? Think clearly before you answer. I'd like to remind you that you are under oath. I'd toot my own horn, too, if it wasn't such a slam dunk. A first-year law student would've got a settlement. Not for 147 million! 200 would have been better. Chastity, you're awesome, and we are hitting the clubs tomorrow night to celebrate... on you. Yeah, right. I have a huge deposition to prepare for. You know I have to be flawless, right? Chastity, you're gonna flame out if you keep up this pace. You need a drink or two in you, and a dirty dance with a hot guy. But I already have a man in my life. I'm about to go pick him up now. And there he is! Duncan! There's my little guy. Thank you. We will see you tomorrow. -You're welcome. Have a good one. Come on. Roxanne, sweetheart. Would you let me by? Roxanne, don't you think this is a little bit of an overreaction? I just got upset. - You know that's not me. - What's not you? That, right there? Did your fist do that right next to my head, or am I remembering incorrectly? I hurt myself, not you. You know I would never hurt you. Listen, baby, we're gonna get married, we're engaged. What, are you gonna throw that away for one bad night? If it were one bad night... no. Don't do that. But we both know it's not just that. Hey, man. What are you doing in my office? Just checking in. We still on for racquetball? Uh, yeah. Yeah. I guess, yeah. Buddy, I mean, you gotta treat it like she's dead and move on. It's just hard, man. Look. The best thing to do is get back on the horse. Nothing makes you forget about a woman better than another woman. Yeah. I guess. Let's dance! I gotta go. Oh, there you go. Bet he'd bang your gavel. Oh, Melanie, you gotta stop. I told you I'd only come out for one drink. I'm having one drink. What happened to you? You used to be the one dragging me out to the club! Melanie, nothing happened, but the road to partner isn't paved with club-hopping. Well, I went through med school and started a practice, and still had time for this. What happened to the modern woman who wanted it all? Melanie, I still want it all, it's just that the only name change I need is my name on that door at the office. Okay. Okay! But, uh... I can open doors for you, too. Watch this. Trust me! Don't do that! Hi there! - Hi. Let me ask you something. - Hi. Um, isn't my friend here uncommonly beautiful? Uh... yeah. Uh... I'd actually say that you were, um... underestimating things. She's brilliant, too. Big-time lawyer. Oh? Well, I'm a lawyer, too. For real? Yeah. Yeah, I'm with Steyer and Smith. I don't know about "big-time," but... Yeah, that's big-time. Well, then... I'll leave you two to cross-examine. My gosh, I can't take her anymore. Yeah, I'm so sorry. Oh, don't be. Don't be. I wouldn't have had the nerve to come up and talk to you. What firm are you with? Um, I'm with Garvey Lobel, but I won't be there long if I don't get... "Get back to my desk". Let me guess... deposition? How did you know that? I didn't, but I know what it's like trying to get everything perfect. It's tough measuring up when the bar is so high. You have a tough time measuring up? I find that hard to believe. Well, why don't you give me some time, and maybe I can convince you beyond a reasonable doubt. I'm here to have one drink with an old friend. Now you got a new friend. So... let's have one more drink, huh, and maybe I can make my case? All right. Can we get, uh... Can I get you a drink for last call? - Oh, my gosh! - That is so lame. All jokes about lawyers are lame... Lame and mean, if you tell 'em right. Okay, you're next, go ahead. Okay. How does a defense attorney sleep at night? Oh, I remember hearing this one! How is it, again? They lie on their left side... And they lie on the right...! And they lie on their right side. Oh, my gosh. Okay, well, listen, I've got to get going. Did... Did you know it's after one a.m.? Well, I knew that, but I wasn't about to tell you. Oh... I gotta get going. All right, you knew this was coming. Give me your number. Xavier, it was wonderful meeting you and... Don't tell me that. No. No, seriously, seriously. I'm just not into the dating thing. - Oh, come on. - I'm so swamped at work. It's just really hard right now. How about this... I'll take your number. I'll put it in my phone. And I will try to call you once... no more than three times. If I get voicemail, I promise, I'll delete you. Oh... But at least, this way, you won't have any regrets. I'm a lawyer. I should know better. But okay. Hey! Oh, my baby girl! Hi, Mama. I'm so glad you're here. Oh, Mama. You're early! I know. I made good time. I thought you were coming on the 6:00 ferry. Well... maybe I was driving a little fast. Okay. I'm making your favorite. I'm excited. Where's the birthday boy? He is in the living room. Okay, I'll be right in there. Come on, Duncan. Let's go see him. Happy birthday, Dad. - Hey-hey! - Hey! There she is! - Oh, good to see you. - Good to see you, too. I brought you a little something. You didn't have to do that. Oh, open it. A Brown Estate Special Selection Cab? That must have put you back a pretty penny. Well, I won a big case the other day, so I wanted to splurge. Well, that kind of law certainly does pay, doesn't it? Most law does. Just thought you'd like it. I do. Thank you, sweetheart. Okay. I'm gonna put Duncan downstairs. Before you say anything, you know he didn't mean it. Yes, he did, Mama. He just couldn't resist. You know, your dad respects what you do. It's just that, sometimes, it feels like you want your life to be... I want my life to be what, Mom? Well, maybe the opposite of what he does. It's like he thinks he walks on water... The noble defense attorney, advocating for the downtrodden. He gets paid, too, and very well, so I don't understand why he thinks my law is less virtuous than his. In his defense, he's always cared more about justice than two big corporations fighting it out. Geez, Mom. You sound like him. I just want to explain his thought process. I've been with that man for many years now. Maybe you could help expand his thought process, get him to see that when I help corporations settle disputes, that's justice, too. Well, he's right there in the living room. Why don't you go tell him yourself? Mom, I came to celebrate his birthday, not argue with a brick wall. Really? You need to read your Bible. "Honor thy father and mother." This is still your father's house. I know. I read that part of the scripture too, Mom. You know it also says, "And, ye fathers, provoke your children not to wrath." I think mine would fit better on a coffee mug. Yes, ma'am. Let me take this call? I'll be right back. Hello. Welcome to King's Pizza. How can I help you? Wow. You answered, and after only one call. I gave you such an easy out. You know what this means, right? It means that you called at the right time, to rescue me from my parents. I guess it means I have great timing. I'm taking you to dinner tonight. Well, I'm actually out of town, so you're gonna have to dine alone. Really? Yeah. All right. Well, I'm taking you to dinner... tomorrow night. Well, we can go for a drink... one... On Friday night. That's only because you called at the right time. Chastity, this is your local police. We've traced the call. It's coming from inside your house. You better get out of there, now. My gosh, Xavier, you're so corny. I gotta go, but we good? We good. All right, I'll talk to you later. Wow. That is not a dress. That is a lawsuit. Stop it. Hey, so, uh, I was thinking, maybe we can track down that food truck later... Sushi Wham? If you haven't had it, let me tell you, it is... Xavier, I said one drink. I just thought maybe you'd be hungry later. Mm, I bet I know what else you thought. Think again, friend. - Oh... - Whoo! What is your secret? I exfoliate... five to six times a week, but then I do this avocado facial peel that's incredible. We're not talking about complexion, are we? No, I'm not. Okay. It's just that I don't... I don't... do this. I won't tell anyone if you won't. You'd better not. Hey. What's this? You heading back to the club? No, it's... it's getting late. Listen, if you think I was in this just for a quick roll, that's not my style. Of course, I didn't assume that. I like you. I want to keep seeing you. Yeah? Yeah. You wouldn't be one of those nice guys I've heard tales about? The legends are true. And if you let this one get away, you can't go crying to your friends in ten years, saying all the good ones are taken. I got to go. That's so good. Wait, wait. You're trying to get me drunk. Well, I guess whatever does the trick, right? What is that look? It's just that... you-you did all of this... you went this far to celebrate. I haven't celebrated a one-month anniversary since I was a freshman in high school. Are you kidding me? You don't celebrate one-month anniversaries? What's that? Huh? Who does that? I celebrate every special occasion, and that certainly is one of 'em. When's your birthday? December 15th. Come on. No. It's December 15th. You're not gonna believe this. I've gotta show you. If we are not meant to be in the book of fate... December 15th... Both lawyers... Same birthday. Wow. Wow. Whoa. And it appears the angels are onboard. Wow. If that isn't a sign from up above... I mean, actually. Hmm? Hey, what's up? Hey. Can I get you some food? Bring you down something? No, I'm good. I'm just kind of under the gun. They pushed the court date of the W.G.I. case. We lost a witness, so we're scrambling. Well... maybe two lawyers are better than one, huh? Do you have any extra work you want to source out? I'm happy to help. Really, that's much appreciated, Xavier, but I'm gonna be non-existent for the next week. You're gonna have to live without me. You there? Yeah. Yeah, I'm here. Uh... is, uh, there anything else wrong? No, no, it's just that I'm insanely busy. Listen, I'll call you when I'm out of the weeds. Okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'll talk to you later. You're crazy if you don't think that belongs in a frame on my wall. - No! - Let me see it. - Uh-uh. - Look at this. It's amazing! It's the first time I ever painted something in my life. That's the first thing you ever... Okay, it's definitely gonna go on my refrigerator. I'm telling you that right now. Well, great, you can have it. - Oh... - Oh. Let's go... dance in the park. Uh, that's probably the wine talking. Yes. And it's the wine telling me that we need to dance in... ♪ ...the park! ♪ - Okay! - Let's go dance! Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I have on heels. All right. Have a seat. Okay. Oh. Oh, what the hell? I'm going for it. Uh, what's happening here? Marry me. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. I'm serious. Let's get married. No, you're not. What if I told you I was? Oh, my gosh. Look, Chastity, I just never connected with anyone like I have with you. That's really sweet, but... You don't have to answer me right away. Just think about it. You know... we could stay engaged for as long as we want, and we don't have to get married right away, obviously, but I know what I got here. I know, after only eight days of being away from you... the real mistake would be letting you go. And the answer to all this is getting married? When did this occur to you? What if I told you I've been thinking about it for a week? I'd say you need to get your head examined. Well, I mean, I clearly just came up with it now... but it doesn't mean I'm not serious. This is epically romantic... but no more wine for you. All right, at least I let you know how I felt. I'm so glad you did. And I'm-I'm glad you're in my life. - Right. - Okay. Will you call me when you get home? Mm-hmm. Okay. Bye. You wouldn't know a guy by the name of Roger Thompkins, would you? He just skipped out on his check. Roger? Oh, my god! Ooh! What're you doing here? Hey, I'm not a total rube. I get to the big city every now and then. Okay, sit! Sit. Talk to me. Chaz, Chaz... Wow. Look at you, looking like a zillion bucks. Oh, thank you. I can't believe I'm seeing you. I mean, what has it been... Seven or eight years? Easy. Actually, I run into your folks a lot back at home. I hear you're doing really well. I'm doing all right. What have you been up to? Don't answer that. Mom told me that you're in business for yourself. I am. Businessman. That's so, so good. I'm happy for you. Wow. I don't know why I put anything in this purse. It takes me three years to find anything... Whew... mm, oh. So you wouldn't need that pepper spray if you stuck with the karate, young lady. Well, have you seen what my neighborhood has turned into, young man? Please, give me your phone and email. And email? - Absolutely, absolutely. - Okay. Date of birth, height, weight... - Need my social, too? - Absolutely. - I do background checks... - Some things don't change. - Oh, Xavier! - Hey. I would love for you to meet an old friend of mine. How're you doing? - Roger Thompkins. - Hi. We grew up together, home in Wave Crest. - Ah. - Yeah. You know what? I gotta go, but keep in touch. I will! And please, send me pictures of the new place. Nice seeing you, Chaz. Aww! So good to see you. - You too. - All right. Oh, my gosh! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spoil the reunion. - Oh, no. - Chaz. Stop it, Xavier. You're right on time. I'm starving! Listen, I was thinking... Maybe later we could go check out that museum you were talking about. What do you think? I was kind of thinking something different. You gotta give me a little bit more warning next time you get so enthusiastic. I'm gonna have to up my cardio regime in the morning. Oh, I'm sorry. I needed a stress-reliever, big-time. Oh, no, I am more than happy to oblige. Big-time. Thank you. Sorry I was late earlier. I'd sent this accidental email at work and I had to do some fancy footwork to get out of it. - Oh, no. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, I fixed it, but it could've been bad. The unforgiving "send" button. Hmm! That's right. You at least had your buddy there to keep you company, though. Yeah. I was so surprised. What does he do, anyway? What's his name again? R... - "Roger." - Roger. - Mm-hmm. - Roger, right. He owns a karate dojo, and in fact, that's how we met when we were kids. We took the same karate class. You took karate? - Yes. - Oh. I did. I am a green belt. So, if anybody should be bullying you or bothering you, call me. Yes, there is one, uh, it's a guy in accounting he keeps on stealing my juice box. Well, karate was the extracurricular activity my father insisted on. But it didn't stick. Roger kept going, and we stayed friends. Just friends? Or... maybe a little bit more? Okay, well, maybe we dated for a year in high school... Oh. He's a small-town guy and I'm a big-city girl. It wasn't gonna last. What if the circumstances were different? What if you never left the small town, or he was in the big city, then what? Then, of course, we'd... We'd be married with ten kids. I know you're not the jealous type. Well, I'm not jealous. I'm not jealous at all. It's just that I could tell he's still into you. Oh, no, no, you could not. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, no, he's not. I'm telling you. - I could see it. - Whatever. It's all right there in the eyes. What, are you psychic now? No. I'm not psychic. People don't realize how much they give away with their eyes and their facial expressions, that's all. Mm. Well... what are my eyes saying now? That you want round two. You do have a gift. No, no, no. That was the perfect ending to that movie. Oh, no. It was... It was depressing. Yeah, but it was real. If she got on that train, it would have been a cheat. No, you don't... The ending was okay, but... something about the priest not being able to, you know, see anything or... what was he, blind? He didn't know anything about it. Oh, speaking of priests... Did you get the invite to Joanne's baby's christening? Oh, I did, and I'm dreading it, 'cause I know it's gonna be a big production. You know, my family, we just kind of do the family thing, and we just move on. Well, you know, to me, it's not a christening unless you smash a champagne bottle over something. Oh, well, babies' heads are too soft for that, darling. Well, obviously, we'd... We'd put a helmet on them. Y'all are definitely made for each other. This is true. Can I have a piece of cake? Absolutely. Are you religious, Xavier? Can I ask? Yeah. You can ask. Um, I'm of the "undecided" denomination. Really? Are you an atheist? Well, agnostic. I'm gonna need a little bit more evidence before I take it to the jury. How about you, Chastity? I'm not the big churchgoer that I once was, but I still believe the broad strokes. The Ten Commandments, the Seven Deadly Sins... Well, you all can keep your Ten Commandments. I'm gonna go with the Deadly Sins. They sound more fun. Right? Well, here is to Gluttony. Cheers to that! An agnostic? Your parents are gonna love that. Oh, let 'em think what they want. Not everybody was raised in the church. Are we at the meet-the-parents stage yet? Am I nuts, but is he a great catch? He ticks off every box I can see. Again, not to get ahead of ourselves, but do you think he's the marrying type? If anyone is... he is. Did I tell you he proposed a few weeks ago? No! You most certainly did not. He got on one knee, girl. Chastity. Okay. He was... He was drunk. It was cute, but he was drunk. Okay, is it just me, or is that crazy-cuckoo? It was impulsive... He's a romantic. He's so embarrassed by it still. I don't even bring it up. Oh, my Lordy-Lord. I don't know. I don't exactly know what happened, but... oh, I sent the email, and then I realized that I forgot to take her off "cc" s. I realized it was an idiotic mistake, and I tried to fix it. Trying to "fix it" was the idiotic mistake. You should have come to us first. But you were more concerned with covering your own ass than following protocol, and now we have this huge mess. You're right. You're absolutely right, and I'm sorry. I, uh, I won't do it again. Not with this client. You're off the case. No. W-Whoa. That's... That's too far. You can't be serious. You know, we bear some of the responsibility ourselves on this. You just weren't ready for something this delicate. If it comes between losing this client and losing you... we are not losing this client. You have anything else you want to say for yourself? Yeah? "Yeah?" How about we start that again? I'm sorry, baby. I'm... I'm just having a day. Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. You know, you can tell me anything. No. It'll just upset me all over again. Well, would a home-cooked meal help? Immensely. Perfect. I'll order up some Thai. See you soon. You like that? So what do you think? Oh, my gosh, Roger, your new place looks amazing. I can't wait to come visit. I'm so proud of you. Thanks! I'm just getting started. Listen, Xavier's here, so I've got to go, but we'll talk soon. Hi! Hey. Ohh. Oh... you're quite tense. Yeah, I told you, I had a rough day. Chastity, why... why is it that I'm always finding you yukking it up with your ex? What do you mean, "always"? Come on, it's only been, like, two times. You're telling me you only talked to him these last two times? Okay. Let's set an early relationship rule, here. We're not gonna take out our office problems on each other. "Office problems"? I'm not talking about office problems. I'm talking about you striking up again with your ex. You're not actually jealous? Do not talk to me that way. It's a perfectly reasonable take-away. Yeah, but I wouldn't take that away if I walked in on you talking to somebody that you said you dated for a second in high school. A second? Yeah, I mean... - Oh, my God. - A second? You said you dated him for, like, a year or something. Listen, you're obviously not in the state of mind to have a rational conversation. Man, I hate that. Hate what? That I want you to be rational? I hate that you assume that I'm not, just because I'm upset. You're upset about something irrational. Look. Why don't we just call this a night where you can go home and get some sleep and have some distance from the day... Don't dismiss me. You are the one that invited me over here. That was before you accused me of running around on you. So what are you gonna do? Kick me out? I'm going to ask you to leave. Please. That's a good idea, actually. I-I think so. I'm gonna get out of your hair. Why don't... let you do me a favor... call your best friend, Roger, back. Talk to him all damn night. Good luck. - Cheers. - Cheers. You should really be proud of the work you have done. I mean, we really came through with this one. - Excuse me, miss? - Yes. This is from the gentleman at the bar. Excuse me for a moment. Chastity... How did you even know I was here? Lucky guess. I appreciate the gesture, but I'll replace the phone. Look, about the other night, I just wanted to, uh... Listen, it's okay, I know you didn't mean it. All is forgiven, but... I think we should leave things the way they are and let's just go our separate ways. I'm a survivor of child abuse. That's not meant to be an excuse, by any means, but just to let you know that... why, sometimes, I behave irrationally. Look. I've avoided therapy my entire life, but after the other night, I realized that I'm gonna need some if I'm gonna get any better. Having you in my life as a friend wouldn't be so bad either. Tell me. Well... So my mom had me when she was very young and she just couldn't handle keeping a job and raising a young son. So she abused you? No. No, no. I loved my mom. But, um... she had to leave town for a bit to get herself set up better, and she left me with my grandma. She was a very angry person, my grandma, and then, my mother died. For years, I had to put up with that... that monster. I'm telling you, that does things to you. I eventually got away. I, um... buried myself in the books. That got me scholarships, put me through college, and eventually law school, so, my brain's good... it's just my soul that's broken. I understand. That's all that I was hoping for. But you do need therapy. Yeah. I know. And you can't ever let yourself get the way you did the other night. I won't stick around for that. So, does this mean you're... keeping the phone? For now. But I don't give third chances. I mean it. I know. It's okay. It feels good to finally be the hero over here after such a long time in the doghouse. Oh, you saved the day, baby. They just merely underestimated my greatness, is all. Chastity? Lewis wants to see you in his office. Okay, just give me one minute. He said "right now". All right. Okay, babe, I got to go. I gotta call you back. Bye. "Junior partner". Mm! That's me. Say it again. Junior partner, on her way to "senior partner". Mm, now, that sounds so good. Ten more years, you're gonna be running the joint. Oh, right, how am I gonna do that at the White House? I don't know how you're gonna get enough votes for the White House, carrying around that ratty-assed briefcase. "Ratty-assed briefcase"? Now, that was a gift from my father. For what, your fifth birthday? Come on! You've got to trade it in for something better. What, you or the briefcase? Why would you say a thing like that? Have I not been the perfect yin to your yang? Yes, you have, I'll admit. Try this. - Hmm? - Mm! Now we're talking. - Can I cook? - Mm-hmm! You can. You know, I was... I was wondering if you would like to have dinner with me and my father? Really? He's coming into town next week. I was thinking that... it's time. Don't you? Yeah. I do. Wow. I mean, Chastity never told me that her father was the Victor Jeffries. Oh, I never told you that? I thought I did. Come on now. It's not like I'm Thurgood Marshall over here. I can't believe that I didn't put it together when we were first introduced. Ah, there's more than one attorney named Victor Jeffries, I'm sure. None with your reputation, however. I mean, you smashed through boundaries where they were never broken before. I studied many of your cases in law school. Hopefully the ones I won. Are there any other kind? Enough, sadly. All right, I think you've inflated Dad's ego enough for one night. Yes, I'd like to be able to fit my head through the door on my way out. My apologies. Didn't mean to pour it on. Would you both excuse me for a moment? Of course. So... do we like him? He's very nice. He's a very... smart young man. "But"? Why does there have to be a "but?" Because... we are getting pretty serious and I could see us being together for... well, a long time. Well... you're a grown woman. Yeah, I know that. I was just asking your genuine opinion of him. I know he's a nice guy. I know he's a smart guy. Come on, Dad. Chastity, you're my daughter. I love you very much. And I think... you'd be smart to move on from this man. Go on. Please. He strikes me as a man of great style, but very little substance. You know, I'm curious, Dad. Have there been any choices that I have ever made that have measured up - to your standards? - This again. Yes, "this again". When I was just learning to stand, you thought I should already be walking. I starting walking, you thought I should already be running marathons. You know better than to exaggerate when you're trying to make a case, Chastity. We're not in a courtroom, Dad! No, we're not. We're in the real world. You're my daughter. I knew you'd have to be better equipped than your competitors, so I tried to give you the equipment. And I also knew that, for you to succeed, you'd have to work twice as hard, and be twice as good, so I pushed you hard. And to whom much is given, much is required... So forgive me, Ms. Junior Partner... but it seems to have worked out pretty damn good. Clearly, it's something. I mean, your mood went from a ten to a two out of nowhere. It's my father. But just, please, let's drop it. Okay, I would... but it feels like you're taking it out on me. How am I taking it out on you? I just don't want to talk about it. This obviously has something to do with me, so it makes it at least partly my business. It's nothing new, but I was just seeking approval from my father, and I didn't get it. End of story! Approval of what? Me? Yes, Xavier, but please don't take it personal. He's never approved of anything I've done. Well, it's clear his approval means something to you. I mean, look, if he doesn't like me, fine. You know, I wish he did, but I'll live with it. But why does what he thinks about me matter to you so much? You know, his reputation isn't exactly spotless, for all the polish. Xavier. I thought you were trying to make a name for yourself. Listen, his approval does not matter to me. You haven't said two words to me since we left the restaurant. I'm angry at my father! I don't want to talk to anybody. This... this is your problem, Chastity. This, right here, is the key to all of your problems. - Oh, here we go. - No, no, no. It all comes down to Daddy, doesn't it? Excu... Xavier, you're walking close to the edge! I'm walking close to the edge? Yes, you are. I think you are willing to sabotage what we have over your father's approval for just one second, and that's why you focus so much on your career over your personal life. So tell me, how's that going for you so far, Chastity? I don't need you to be my armchair psychiatrist, okay? How about you worry about your mommy issues before you worry about me and my daddy issues? Hey, listen, you don't talk about it like that. - Excuse me? Xavier... - Do you understand me? - Get your hands off me! - Stop pulling away from me. Let me go! You okay... You okay? All right, I bear gifts from the all-night shop. Now... there were only two choices... So, not a lot... And you are definitely not the "World's Greatest Grandpa". What do you think? Yeah... this is supposed to fix things? Chastity, it was an accident. You shoved me into the street and a car almost hit me. You fell off the curb. This is just not going to work. Listen to me, Chastity... I understand where your rage comes from, and I'm very sympathetic to that, but you cannot direct it at me. But that's why I started therapy. - If you would give it... - I told you I am not giving you a third chance. So, what... Because of this rule you set for yourself, you're gonna throw every other damn thing away? I mean, a couple of hours ago, you were taking me to meet your-your dad, and now you're here, you're willing to... to break up, for what, one lousy argument? What is the matter with you? Look at you. Look at how furious you are getting. And it is more than anger. When you boil over, it turns into pure wrath. And that can't be my burden. I cannot let that be. Chastity, please. This just happened, so everything is raw. I'm gonna give you whatever time you need to gain perspective on this. You have to know I love you. Yeah. I know. But that's not enough. Don't do this, Chastity. Sorry. It's over. I'm sorry. Oh, God. And how about you? How are things? I've been killing it at work lately. You know, I-I thought... Thought everything was back to normal. But those guys, I'm telling you, they just... They don't let me live down that one stupid mistake. I'm starting to think that I need to look for another job at a different firm. I don't know. Do you equate their treatment of you as abandonment? "Abandonment"? Really? Is there any other way to look at it? Of course, it's abandonment! I'm just saying maybe it's not a very good fit for you there. Not every bad thing that happens should be a confirmation of your fears. That's incredible. - Okay, what about, um... - Using "shrink language" on me? How about Chastity? Have you stopped trying to get in touch with her? I only get voicemail. She doesn't return my calls or my texts. Which is absolutely ridiculous, because I think she at least owes me a damn conversation after what happened! Doesn't she? I didn't mean to hurt her. I think you need to take stock of where this obsession with her has gotten you. Obsession? Seriously? I'm not obsessed with her! I am in love with her! Okay. Maybe so. But, Xavier, she's not in love with you. Look, you have to understand, it's her decision. She has every right to end things with you. And the healthiest thing you can do is to accept that and move on. We're done here. And I just had to say no. I'm a plastic surgeon who draws the line. I'm not about to make her face look like it's vacuum-sealed. Well, that kind of thing, it kind of sounds like a mental disorder, if you ask me. Too true, too true. Anyway... what about you? Oh, girl, I'm good. I'm all right. Is he still trying to call? Oh, my gosh, all the time. I am on your side, but I do feel sorry for him. Me too, but that's the way it's gotta be. Do you still miss him? Oh, of course I do. Sometimes. But I'm not about to be a woman in an abusive relationship. I'm sorry. Should I not have brought him up? It's okay. You know, it's my mistake, but I've learned from it. Well, if there's anything you need, I'm right here for you. Oh! Oh... Look, girl, I gotta go. Oh, no. He was right about one thing... That I do need a new briefcase. I've got a package for you. Wow, what is this box? I don't know. A messenger delivered it. Okay, thank you. You're welcome! Hey. I guess you got it? Yes, I got it. What is this about? I just wanted to get your attention. Anyone could send flowers, right? No. No. What is the briefcase about? What'd you do, bug my apartment? What are you talking about? I mean, I spilled wine on my briefcase last night, and, by coincidence, this shows up. Maybe it's a coincidence when it showed up, but we both know you were in need of a briefcase. We talked about this, sweetheart. No, no, no. Some... Something's going on. Xavier, I swear, if you did something like that, - then I'm gon... - I missed you, all right? I thought the gesture would get you to talk to me, maybe you'd agree to let me take you to dinner, that's all. Xavier, it's over! Move on! And I'm asking you, do not call me again. So, yeah... you have definitely got spyware all over this thing. Really? How could spyware be on this? I have this with me all the time. Yeah, it could've been a bunch of things. You download a file, something attached to an email. Also, nobody has their computer with them all the time. Somebody could've slipped a thumb drive into it. It takes, like, a couple seconds. Okay, well, well, what would a person like this have access to? All of it. Everything on the computer. What if I did a video call? If it happens on your screen, they'd be able to see it. How can we prove who did it? Can we trace them? How could we get pee out of a pool? No, look, this could've happened in the next office over or literally any boiler room on planet Earth. I would recommend you just wipe this thing totally clean. Yeah. Okay, all right. Thanks. Mm-hmm. I'm gonna see if he's home. Well, look who it is. Hey, Roger. 'Kay, I have a question. Shoot. Why do you think I have such bad judgment in men? Is this a trick question? Because I'm somewhere on that list. Well, that was in high school. High school's where it all begins, right? If I'm being honest, I feel all your troubles began when you let me go. You broke up with me! Oh, I broke up with you? Who was the one who said, "Roger, I'm going to Seattle, you're staying here. Things aren't gonna work out." And after I said that, you broke up with me. Uh-huh. You're such a lawyer. What's bothering you, Chaz? I won't bore you with it. 'Cause I live a very exciting life, huh? Please, bore me. What're you talking about? See? You don't even know. Your dad loved me! - No, he didn't. - He did! He told me himself. My dad told you he loved you? Well, no. But you know how your dad is, he didn't say those exact words, but he pulled me to the side one day, and he was, like... "Roger. You're a good guy. But you hurt my little girl, I'm gonna kill you." Oh, my gosh! No, he did not. I don't think he sounded like that, but, shortly after, you dumped me. I never took it personal. I always assumed his seal of approval was what did me in. Had I known he liked you, that probably would've been enough. Roger, you are a good man. And you even came all this way just to hear me complain. Well, next time, you come to the island and return the favor. I will. I'd better get going. Until next time. I'll see you again. Thank you, Roger. I'm here to pick up my little friend. Oh, he was already here. Who was already here? Your friend. Picked up Duncan, like, an hour ago. No. What're you talking about? Yeah, you texted me. Did you forget? Wait. No! Tha... "Hello. I can't make it in today. Please allow my friend..." Xavier, what are you doing? Just what it looks like. I picked up your dog for you. Give him to me! Just one second. No, I've already called the police. Aww, Chastity, you're making this bigger than what it is. Okay. Y-You're right, but... I just want you to talk to me. I stayed away, all right? I proved to you that I'm not some clinging lunatic. Okay. Xavier... w-we're talking. You haven't been fair to me, Chastity. Yeah, sure, I did a bad thing... but I don't think I deserve this. We can't have a real conversation with you holding Duncan like that. The fact that I'm holding him like this is the only reason why you're talking to me. Xavier, I promise you, you just give Duncan to me, we can sit awhile, we can talk about this. We can work this out. Just like I was saying to you... A person's eyes... Oh... I know you're lying. That hurts me... and that makes me want to hurt you. Xavier. I've missed you. I've missed you so much. Duncan! Chastity! ♪ A-ma... ♪ ♪ ...zing grace ♪ ♪ How sweet ♪ ♪ The sound ♪ ♪ That saved ♪ ♪ A wretch ♪ I made you some tea, baby. Thanks, Mom. It's so nice to have you home, Chastity, despite the circumstances. How long do you plan on keeping what happened from your father, though? I just don't want to give him another win right now, on top of everything else. Chastity, he's your father. He wants to know that you're safe. Mom, I told you. Xavier was arrested and charged with battery. I don't think he wants to throw his life away on me. He's out on bail, though. We don't know what he's going to do. Well, that's why I got a restraining order. It's just a piece of paper, baby. Mom, what else do you want me to do? Xavier, he doesn't know I'm here, so... I thought I could just... Just recharge and reassess everything's that's happened, and Melanie's gonna take good care of my dog till I get back. Well, why don't you go to church with me tomorrow? We haven't done that in a while. I'm so angry at God right now. He's all-powerful. Why does he allow things like this to happen? Why does God allow you to be such a successful attorney? When the good things happen, do you always stop and thank God? No. Well, then if you don't thank him for the good things, then maybe don't blame him for the bad things. We have a choice whether we want to be good or bad. Some folks decide that they want to be bad. I blame them, not God. Fine. I won't blame God, but... I think he could've thought through things a little better. Front kick. - Hyah! - Side kick. - Hyah! - Roundhouse. - Hyah! - Alicia, great job! You're a real, live beast. What do you say when a beautiful woman is approaching? We make like logs and split! Class dismissed. Great job today. Aw, that's so sweet. So is that how you win all the girls over? Just some wisdom from my sensei, and his sensei before him. All right, Kung Fool. Where are you taking me to eat? Before we go eat, I need you to do something for me first. Punch me. With everything you got. I've been waiting for this moment. I'm serious. Punch me. Roger, I don't want to do that. Try again. Yeah, just what I thought. You're gonna need some work. Oh, yeah, right. I put up my belt a long time ago. Well, you better get the dust off of it. Look, I'd rather you be prepared in case Romeo pop up again, okay? Listen, the problems that I have with Xavier will not be solved through a karate fight. A wise philosopher once said, it's better to know. If you need to use it, you can use it. If you don't, then don't. It's muscle memory. You know that. Okay. Too late for your pepper spray. What you gonna do? Oh! Mm! - I'm so sorry. - No, that was... that was good. So, are you coming over to Mom's? All right, Miss Sarah. I think that's enough cans for these boxes. I don't want it too heavy. What? You're supposed to be a strong karate man. You can't carry a box? I can put it in the truck, but somebody scrawny like you has to take it off at the church. You two! What? I'm just having a deja-vu about when you were teens and you used to take jabs at each other to cover how sweet you were on each other. And then I'd catch you out back in a lip-lock. That'll do, Mom! That's enough. Y'all thought I didn't know what was going on, huh? You know what? Imma finish loading the truck. Okay? I didn't hear none of that. Thanks, Mom. I know what I did wrong. She just needed more time to think things through, that's all. You put your hands on her. You broke into her house. That's the kind of crap crazy people do. You're in big trouble, all right? You were arrested. You're on forced leave from the firm. You're lucky if they don't fire your ass, not to mention maybe losing your law license. Get your head out of your ass. All right? It's over. She doesn't want you. And if that's the way it is, I'm cool with that. Just don't call me crazy. My serve. There we go. Okay? Come on. Okay. Okay. - There we go. - Okay. There we go. Just like riding a bike. Yeah, but I didn't land any of those hits I was trying to throw. I'm a fifth-degree black belt. Nobody's landing those. An ordinary Joe could be in big trouble, though. But that was fun. That... I won't be too hard on myself, it was fun. You should have stuck with it. Yeah, I agree. Maybe you should've stuck with me, too. I... I agree. Well, with that being said, maybe you should practice law over here at the island, move back over, we'll pick back up where we left off. How about you move to the city and open up a dojo there? Mm. I like it here. I like it there. But... I'm here now. Oh, really? Yes. Well, get over here. Mm! Come on. Got you some VIP tickets. Front of the row. That's so sweet. You can be real sweet. I love this. Look at that. Wow. Roger... Roger! - What? - Xavier's here. - Who? - Xavier! He's right there. Come on. Come on! Hey. Hey! Hey! My fault, man. I... I thought you were somebody I knew. Drink up. We don't have a long break. Even as a kid, I just never liked cilantro. You're not gonna taste the cilantro. See? That's the point! Then why put it in there? Listen, can you get my gloves for me in the car? - Right now? - Please. I love to see you walk. Only because you said that. I'm gonna let you enjoy the view. It's a great one. Hi, Chastity. Xavier, what the hell are you doing here? I was just in the neighborhood, visiting some clients, although, I thought I might run into you. You don't have any clients in this neighborhood! Let's just agree to disagree on that, huh? You look nice, however. It's nice to see you. I have a restraining order against you, and you are well within 100 feet of me. I'm not supposed to be anywhere near you, I know that, and you're probably afraid of me, but I'm just here to tell you that you don't need to be. All right? If you'd just give me ten minutes of your time, - I'm sure you'll... - Xavier. Your time ran out a long time ago. I thought you were supposed to be Christian? I thought you were supposed to be the one that's... supposed to forgive? Look, if you'd just allow me 10 minutes, that's all I'm asking for, and you understood the pain that... Is there a problem over here? Oh, great, of course, Roger's with you. Why don't you mind your own business, pal? - I'm making this my business. - Oh, really? She obviously doesn't want to talk to you. Let me tell you this, okay? You keep things pleasant, there'll be no need for things to get unpleasant. - Help! - Listen to me, okay? If you want to live a long, fruitful life, I advise you to never contact Chastity again. Let go of me! - Do you understand? - Get the hell off me! I have a restraining order against him. I'll take that as a yes. Out of here. Chastity! You know I love you. Why are you doing this to me? You know... you could have told me before. You should have. I know. I... I just didn't w... It... It's over. I hope so. But you were right about him. Once again, you knew better than I did. Sweetheart, I am not trying to be in a contest with you. Why don't you just believe that I just want the best for you? Ever since you were a little girl, that's all I wanted. I pushed too hard for excellence, because I knew life would push you harder. But you were right. You were. I just wanted to tell you. It's not about me being right. Since the day you were born, you had me beat. I'm going to bed. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. What? No. No, no, no, no. I-It was him. Who else would do such a sick thing? An animal heart? Yes. He definitely did it. But that's not all that he did. What do you mean? Roger, what else did he do? I'm coming to get you. Oh, Roger! Your new place. Watch your step. There's glass over here. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. Chastity. Detective. Why did you let him go? He made bail. He was just arrested last night. Wasn't there going to be an arraignment? This isn't the city. The judge that's out here, he... well, he went fishing. Anyway, we haven't found any prints so far, but guys who do things like this always leave something behind. He's not gonna leave any prints behind. He's a lawyer. He knows exactly what you guys look for. You have no idea where he might be? Well, he could be anywhere, but... I mean, what good is that gonna do if he didn't leave any proof that he did this? Something's gonna come up, Chastity. Okay? We're still collecting evidence. But one thing we know for sure is that he's still out there... and you can't help me. There we go. Good job. Damn! Good kick. But you're using too much of your lower body, okay? More balance. You got arms, right? Use 'em, young lady. But you said "Good kick." Right! But I'm anticipating kicks, 'cause that's all you're doing, All right, I need a break. All right, so, tomorrow, Imma teach you how to rip out a man's heart and show it to him before he dies, - like the movies, okay? - No, please. I've seen enough hearts lately, thanks. Roger, I-I do have to get back to the city. I have to get back to my life. Think that makes the most sense? I mean, maybe you should wait until the cops pick him up. Well, the cops'll pick him up, lock him up, and then he'll make bail. Again. I can't hide forever. Chastity, this man's dangerous. Yeah, but if he wanted to kill me, he would've done it the other night when he was in my room. A man with a mind like that, who thinks like that... I think you need to take him more serious. Are you suggesting that I'm not taking this seriously? I'm suggesting that you stay smart, stay aware. Why do you think you'll be safer in the city anyways? And I'm safe here? Roger, I've got to clean this mess up myself. I brought this here. I brought this to you, I brought this to my parents. You don't need to worry about me. And you don't need to worry about me. I can handle myself. A woman with a psychopath stalker? Of course, I will worry about you. Roger, I just got out of a controlling relationship. I'm not trying to control you. You know that. I'm trying to help protect you. But that's the problem. You can't. And the presumption that I need a knight on a horse? You know it's not like that. I gotta pack. Chastity, come on. Are you seriously gonna leave things like this? What do you mean by things? Us? Yes. Us. Roger, I thought we both understood. You like things here. I like things there. Remember? Roger, I'm not upset. I'll call you before I leave. - Hi. - Hey, Mama. Oh, girl, I wish you didn't have to go. I know, but it's time. I'm still gonna worry. Listen, I've had about $7,000-worth of security equipment installed in my apartment. I'll be okay. Well, one more piece of security won't hurt. I got you a going-away present. Mama! That's not even wrapped! Just take it, baby, please? You can't just give me a gun. That's not legal! Since when do you have a gun, anyway? Girl, everybody on this island has at least one gun. How many cops you think we have? Oh, come... Just put it in your nightstand. And if it doesn't give you some comfort, it's certainly gonna give me some. Mom, you know they're gonna trace my life of crime back to this moment. Hey. Hey. I'm sorry we argued. Yeah, me too. I know you're just concerned about me. I know you don't need a big, strong man to take care of you. I just can't help it that I'm a big, strong man. You know, no matter what, I always enjoy talking to you. Yeah, right. I do! I'm about to get ready for my night run. So, run on over here and see me off. You're leaving tonight? Well, how can I convince you to stay another day? What was that? Roger? Roger? Hey! Are you okay? Roger! Call an ambulance! - Excuse me? - I'm sorry, but I'm a friend of his. You can come in. He's stable for now. "For now"? Um, how bad is he? He's going to make it. You can put your mind at ease about that, miss, okay? Thank God. But he did sustain a lot of injuries. Um... is there anything permanent? Will he walk again? There's no reason to think he won't make a full recovery. But he is gonna be here for a while. Okay. Thank you. Just take your time. Thank you. Thank you so much. Roger? I'm so, so sorry. Ohh. Mm. What a day. You must be exhausted. Oh, I don't even have the words. Thank you, Detective. I think I have it from here. All right. Get some rest, Chastity. Thank you so much. I'll try. Thank you. "I'm leaving the hospital now. I'll be home soon." I didn't leave it open. What the heck? Hmm? Get in the car! Where's your boy, Roger, now? Ow. Ow! Your leg's broken. I mean, it looks broken. Another way to put it is you broke my leg. It didn't have to come to this, Chastity. It didn't "come to this". You brought it to this. And what choice did you give me? Huh? You just shut it all down. Everything. I love you. Then why are you hurting me? You hurt me. Yeah, I did some bad things, I know, but I'm a good person. You didn't even give me a chance. What are you gonna do? Shoot me? I don't know. Maybe I should. I just have this... this anger inside me... I don't know what to do with. You know, I was better when I was with you. Do you know that? Xavier... I want to help you. I do. Well, that's sweet, but it's a little late for that now, Chastity. You did this. You brought out this wrath. And now you're gonna pay. She's still not here? What time is it? She should have been here two hours ago. I don't know why she hasn't called me. She knows I worry. Let's call her again. Okay. And call the detective. I said I'm sorry. Congratulations. Don't you have to forgive me? Why do I have to forgive you for something you did to someone else? Where do you get your rules? "The Agnostic's Guide to Christianity"? She is not late because she's visiting a friend. I know. I just have to explore all possibilities. Nobody's seen her, Sam. We've called everybody we know. Is it possible she changed her mind and made the last ferry, drove herself back to the city? She told me she was coming straight home from the hospital. Okay. I don't want the two of you to work yourselves up too much. We have patrol cars out there, looking. We'll find her. I'm trying to be the guy you wanted me to be. People can change, you know. I know. I'd like to think that you're not beyond redemption. Xavier... this has to stop now. You are not at the point of no return. You see that, Chastity? That's all that I wanted. I just wanted you to talk to me. And to listen. Am I crazy to think that there might still be something between us? Chastity? No. You're not crazy to think that. How can I believe that? We'll find her. I know. - I know. - We will. You gotta go back to therapy. I would do that. And I have to be a part of it. I can't take your word for it that you're making progress. Of course. The only problem is... I don't believe you. Xavier... you don't believe that I sincerely want to help you? I think you're telling me what you think I want to hear. I mean, look at where we are. How do I know you're not just trying to manipulate me? By looking directly into my eyes. The eyes always tell. Right. You'll know if I'm lying. I love you. I love you. Come here! Let me go! I've got wrath, too. Lucky for you... I also got mercy. Chastity! I love you! Chastity! Oh, my God. We were worried out of our minds. I'm okay, it's just a broken leg, Dad. Your mother's gonna meet us at the hospital. I'm coming with you, all right? I love you. Hey. Hey. I obviously missed something. Visiting hours here are too short, so I came up with this. Smart woman. Gamin' the system, huh? You know it. Did they get him? I got him. You? Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah. Only six more deadly sins to conquer. I can't believe you're here. That makes two of us, and everyone else I know. I'm really glad to see you. How have you been? That's not why I'm here, Xavier. Why are you here? I came for one thing... To forget what's behind me and reach to what's ahead. Why? I think it'd do my soul some good. I'm sorry for everything that I did to you. Yeah. Maybe. Xavier, your anger destroyed your life and I was not about to let it destroy mine. You're right. I did what I came to do. Hang on, hang... You know, Chastity, I've got, um, parole coming up in a couple of years. Maybe you could put in a good word? Xavier, how does it always turn right around to you? How is that? You know... you did forgive me. I don't think you will ever get it. Do you understand you put me in prison first? I mean, there were no bars, but I still couldn't get out. I was always wondering if you were gonna be lurking around every dark corner. My forgiveness is not a gift to you. I forgive you so that I can forget. I forgive you so that I can move on. I forgive you to purge my own wrath. Am I stupid to think that you'll come visit me again? I'm never coming back. But I will pray for you. I can do that. Dad? You wanna come back in? You leadin' the witness? Well... old habits die hard. How's that leg? The worst part about it is the itch. It's torture. The worst part is what could've happened to you. But it didn't. I'm okay. But we're not okay, sweetheart. What if I lost you? I'd be the stubborn old man who didn't take the chance when he had it to set things right with his daughter. You're no more stubborn than I am. I have treated you too much like some extension of myself. But you're your own woman, and you've done real well. And you handled this whole thing better than anyone I know would have. I can't tell you how proud it makes me. Thanks, Dad. I really appreciate that. I was just so worried. Yeah, but it's okay. Things worked out. Always been proud of you, Chastity. I'm sorry I haven't said it enough. It would've been nice. But... I'm so glad that you pushed me the way you did. Oh, so... so maybe now you'll admit you should've stuck with karate, like I wanted? See, Dad, there you go. You had to throw a jab in. It's a lovable quirk of mine.
