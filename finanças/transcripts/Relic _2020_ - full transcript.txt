Kay. Hi, it's Mike Adler here from Creswick Police. Look, I'm just calling about your mum. The neighbours haven't seen her in a few days. I've been by her house, without much luck. And I was just wondering if you'd heard from her. Could you give me a call when you can? Thanks. Gran? Gran? Gran? Mum? Gran? Wait. Just…wait out here. Mum? You should set up in my old room. What? - Kay, what? - Nothing. Call straightaway if she… - Yeah, I will. - OK. Does your mum still drive? Sometimes. But her car's still at the house. - And... any medical problems? - No. She's in her 80s. She forgets things. She managed to flood the house last Christmas. And when was the last time you spoke to her? It's been a while. Could... you be more specific? Um… Well, in situations like this, we... we need to come up with a time line. When Alex called last night, he said he hadn't noticed your mum leave the house for a few days, maybe a week. So, if we can figure out who the last person was to speak to her, we can... - Yeah, of course, yeah. - ..Figure out exactly who… Sorry. Um… It's been a few weeks. Work's been crazy. You know how it is. And what did you talk about? Nothing, really. Normal stuff. She didn't mention anything about a holiday, appointment out of town, visiting friends? No. Nothing like that. We'll organise the overall search strategy. OK. - Did you bring a recent photo? - Yeah. This was taken late last year. Jesus Christ. Great... She's been putting food out for Chester. Is your boss OK with you taking time off? Yeah. Well, no. I stopped working at the gallery. Since when? A while. What are you doing for money? I've got some decent shifts back at the bar. Still planning on going back to uni? I don't know, Kay. So, what, you're just gonna work in a bar for the rest of your life? Yeah, maybe. I'm glad you're here. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing. I think you're doing it. Edna! Edna?! - Edna! - Mum! Edna?! Edna?! Mum?! Edna?! Edna?! Edna?! We'll regroup first thing tomorrow. We should check the trail by St Georges Lake. Gran used to take me there all the time when I was a kid. Gran? Jamie? Hi, Sam. What are you up to? Patrolling. OK. Did you find her yet? No, not yet. When was the last time you saw her? Not for ages. Dad doesn't like me coming over anymore. Why's that? Smells weird. Can I have a go? I'm allowed. You're 18! When did that happen? Oh! Thanks, Jamie. I really needed that. I might go inside. It's freezing. Do you want to come in? Make you a Milo? Nah. That's OK. It's D after that bit, not E. How do you know? Gran taught me. Of course she did. I could never get the curl of the fingers right. I think she gave up on me at a certain point. Are these locks new too? I think she was scared. Scared? Of what? She called me a few weeks ago. She thought someone was coming into the house. What? Why? Doors were left open, the lights were left on, she... the... ..armchair had shifted. Well… ..did you tell the police? She forgets things. You know what she's like. It was her. Well, why didn't you call me? I could have driven up here. I mean, what if she was… What was that? Kay? Don't know. What is that? What... what's wrong? Nothing. Go to sleep. Mum? Where...? Where have you been? Tea? Are you OK? One sugar, right? - Gran! - Oh! About half an hour ago. No, she's... she's not hurt. She's... As far as I can tell. She won't tell me anything. Whenever I ask, she just changes the subject, acts like nothing happened. Like she hasn't been gone for three days. Yeah, I don't wanna push her. I just... I just hope she's OK. Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Yeah, I will. Bye. - Any chest pain? - No. Breathlessness? Dysuria? Dysuria? Does it hurt to pee? Oh. No. Neither of those things. Would you mind taking a slow walk to your daughter and back? - Edna, when's your birthday? - April 10th. And how about your granddaughter's? March 3rd. Good. See? This one worries about me. - May I? - Mm-hm. Do you know how you got this bruise? Oh... I must have knocked it. Clumsy. Just to be safe, I'm going to recommend that you not be by yourself for the next couple of weeks. - Is that really necessary? - Sorry, Edna. I insist. House arrest it is, then. Well, tell them it's a family emergency. Yeah, I know that, but he's perfectly capable. Uh-huh. A week, maybe two. Well, what do you expect...? Yeah. Fine. Fine, email it. I've gotta go, Luce. What's that? Do you know where you were, Mum? - Where? - No, I'm asking you. I suppose I went out. Out where? If I'd known you'd call the police, I would have stayed home. There's blood on your nightgown. Do you need help? With what? There are Post-it notes everywhere, Mum. It's my house. I can decorate it however I want. Just tell me what happened! Look, can we just take it easy today? Gran must be exhausted. Gran? Oh. Got your tea. What service! Sorry about Mum. She was worried about you. We all were. I had to stop wearing it. They say you shrink with age, but my fingers just keep getting fatter. It's lovely. It's yours. Gran, I can't take this. You might need it one day. And your mother's already had a go. Wow, you cleaned up. Please leave it. I've got a system. - What are you doing? - Work. Look at this. Guess I was. Wow. He could draw. Yeah. God, I haven't seen this for years. Wait. What's this? Oh... Oh, that was on the property when your grandparents inherited it. My great-grandfather lived there. - By himself? - Yeah. There were all these stories. Apparently, his mind wasn't all there in the end, and nobody knew how bad it was. I don't think he was cared for like he should have been, you know? Mm. I was happy to see it go. Mum used to threaten to lock me in it when I was being a brat. Is that the same window as the one on the door downstairs? Yeah. Yeah, when they tore it down, they saved some of the windows and used them to build into this place. Can you keep an eye on her for a few hours tomorrow? - Where are you going? - Back to Melbourne. - You going back to work? - No. I... I've booked a tour of a retirement place. You can't put Gran in a home. You heard her before. She doesn't know where she was. I don't think she can remember. That's not what I heard. She can't live on her own anymore, Sam. - Well, why can't she move in with you? - Because that's not practical. There's plenty of room at your place. No, it's not about room. She has to be watched. Well, isn't that how it works? Your mum changes your nappies and then you change hers? You need to be on the same side as me for this. Does Gran even get a say? This is what's best for Gran. What noise? No. I didn't hear any noise. I told you. I told you it's nothing. There's no-one. You're scaring me. Mum? Are you alright? Are you leaving? No, Mum. That's good. Will you be alright now? Mum? Mum, what is it? It's here. Under the bed. No, there's nothing under the bed, Mum. Are you sure? Yes. Will you check for me? Please. See? Nothing. You didn't look. Ow! Shit! Oh! Oh! You did that on purpose. - Did what? - You dropped that on purpose! - Why would I do that? - I don't know. - Did you hit your head? - Yes! Yes! Yes. Now, you mentioned your mother has some cognitive impairment? Yeah, I... I don't really know. She forgets things. She's started wandering. Well, the staff here are on call 24/7. Think of it as independent living with the edges taken off. Just in here. This side of the building has ocean views. Handrails in every room, high toilet seat, mobility aids if your mother needs help getting in and out of bed. No, she's fine with that kind of stuff. She's fit, she's active. I... I'm not even sure she's ready for a place like this. Well, it's five-star living. Then there's the lifestyle and therapy programs, disability support, computer classes. Your mum'll make friends in no time.

I'm not a... project, Kay. I'm... I'm Sam, Gran. I know who you are. Well, wouldn't it be better than moving into an old folks' home? That's where Mum is right now - checking out a place in Melbourne. Here, let me help. - What's this? - What? - What are you doing with this? - What do you mean? - This is mine. - Yeah, Gran, you gave it to... You're trying to steal from me. You're trying to rob me. - No. Remember when you... - Give it back. - Give it back! - Ow. Gran. Ow! Ah! Oh! Fuck. Take it! Gran? Are these my school reports? You're throwing these out? I didn't even know you'd kept them. Well, I have to make room, don't I? Room for what, Mum? This one's moving in. No, she's not. She... I think you're confused, Mum. I'm not sure why you think it's your decision. How was Melbourne? Everything alright, Gran? I don't like this place. Is that why you installed the lock? I thought this was where it got in. Who? Whoever was coming into the house. Since your grandfather passed, this house seems... ..unfamiliar. Bigger, somehow. This house is the only thing left. All our memories. I'm glad you're moving in, Sammy. Are you sure? Gran? Gran? Kay? Mum? What's that noise? I think there's something in the house. I need to go downstairs. There's someone down there. Everything alright in there, Mum? Sammy? I'm not being ridiculous. I can tell. Sometimes they look at me and I... I don't think it's really them. They look like Kay and Sammy, but it's not them. They're pretending. You know what I think? I think they're just waiting for the day. I think they're hoping I'll go to sleep and I won't wake up. Then they'll dump me in the ground to rot. I can see you. Who are you talking to? - Gran, you're bleeding. - I can do it myself. - You've hurt yourself. Just... - No! - Gran, stop! - Get out! Get out of here! Get out! Get out! It's my room! - It's my house! Get out! - I'm sorry! Hi, Sam. - Hey, Jamie. How are you? - I'm OK. - Is your dad home? - Uh... Dad?! Alex, what happened... between Jamie and Gran? They were playing hide-and-seek and it was Jamie's turn to hide. And he hid, I guess, in a cupboard with a lock on it. Well, she came along and locked the closet and... left him there. I think she forgot they were playing. He was trapped in that cupboard for hours. When he didn't come home, I went over there to check on him and... ..Edna said she hadn't seen him. But I could... I could hear him screaming from upstairs. He had paint under his fingernails just from scratching the door. So, we've been keeping our distance a bit. Yeah. Nah, of course. I get it. I'm really sorry Jamie had to go through that. OK. Mum... Mum, stop. Stop! Ow! Jesus! What are you doing, Mum?! No! No! - Give it back! - No, Mum! No! I'm still your mother, Kay! I think these might be safe out here. Do you think that's right? Safe from what, Mum? I don't know. I knew it was a bad idea. I hate that window. I can't bear to look at it every time I go through that door. There's such a... ..coldness in the house. This is what I'm like now. It's all I do. I keep thinking... ..thinking maybe it was just waiting for me, maybe it's just been waiting till I was weak enough. Alone enough. I wish I could bury it myself so it can't get at me. I just want to go home. I just wish I... I could turn around and... ..go back. I'm losing everything, Kay. No. It's alright. You're not. I'm here. I'm here to help you, Mum. Come home with me. To Melbourne. Will you... will you move into my place, Mum? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry I wasn't here more. Please let me help you. Yeah? Yeah. Where's... Where's my... Where's everyone? Your photo album? It's here. It's right here. Where's everyone? They're here. They're here. I'm here. It's alright, Mum. Mum... I won't leave you. I'll get dinner started. What do you feel like? Thanks, dear. Sam, we're back! What the...? Fuck this... What? No, no. No. Mum? Mum! Mum! You have called 042...
