[COUGHS] AS PUNISHMENT, LA CROQUE CUT OFF MY HAIR TO MAKE BLACK LACE. WHY IS LA CROQUE SO HORRIBLE? THEY SAY SHE WAS A CABARET STAR ONCE. [CANCAN MUSIC PLAYS] Fifi: THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED. Narrator: FIFI EXPLAINED THAT LA CROQUE WAS A DANCER WHOSE KICKS DAZZLED ALL OF PARIS. AND ONE FATAL NIGHT THROUGH A "SEAMING" MISCHANCE... [FABRIC RIPS] [ALL LAUGHING] UHH!

WHAT TO DO? ¡JASE! I KNOW! Narrator: WHILE PEPITO RAN OFF FOR THE THING HE FORGOT, CLEVER MADELINE TRIED A NEW LACE-MAKING KNOT. [BOBBINS CLACKING] [FOOTSTEPS] Narrator: AS THE FACTORY VILLAINS INSPECTED THE WORK, IT WAS MADAME LA CROQUE WHO FIRST SPOTTED A QUIRK. REGARDEZ! I CAN READ. La Croque: COME UP HERE! ALL OF YOU! AHA! La Croque: HELP... I AM A PRISONER... IN A... LACE FACTORY. YOU WILL STAND HERE ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT, ALL YEAR TILL I FIND OUT WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SACRILEGE.

[BOBBINS CLACKING] Narrator: MADELINE HAD A SLY TRICK UP HER SLEEVE, AND SHE AND THE GIRLS TRIED A TASTEFUL NEW WEAVE. Narrator: WHO SAYS THAT A MOUSE CAN'T APPRECIATE ART?

EXTREMELY RARE. EXTREMELY ZUPER-DUPER. MAGNIFIQUE! BUT I HAVE A RED SILK DRESS. POSSIBLY, EH... LACE MADE FROM RED HAIR? I THINK THAT IS VERY POSSIBLE, BUT TRÈS CHER, VERY EXPENSIVE. [COINS CLINK] YOUR DEPOSIT IS ACCEPTED. I WILL MAKE DISCREET INQUIRIES TO SEE IF THE MASTERPIECE CAN BE OBTAINED. COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS.

[SNIP SNIP] [GASPS] [GASPS] [PANTING] [GASPS] RED HAIR FOR RED LACE. [GASPS] [CLOTH TEARS] [GASPS] [GASPS] YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS! Narrator: AS HENRI HURRIED DOWN THE STREET, HE SNUBBED A LAD HE CHANCED TO MEET. HE ROUNDED THE CORNER BUT FAILED TO SEE A WITNESS WHO KNEW HIS IDENTITY. Miss Clavel: ALORS! THAT IS HIM! BUT SO DIFFERENT. [BRAKES SQUEAL] [SIREN WAILS] [GASPS] Narrator: HE HAD BEEN SPOTTED, HENRI KNEW, AND WILDLY DOWN THE STREET HE FLEW. [PANTING] OHH! Narrator: POLICE PURSUED, BUT SOMEONE SMALL WOULD FINALLY CAUSE HENRI'S DOWNFALL. [PANTING] AAH! OOF! [BRAKES SQUEAL] Miss Clavel: THAT'S HIM! UNCLE HORST FROM VIENNA. UM,MOI? I AM HENRI. I AM FRENCH. I AM INNOCENT. WHY WERE YOU RUNNING AWAY? I WAS WALKING BRISKLY. THAT IS NO CRIME. THIS IS MISTAKEN IDENTITY. CAN YOU PROVE HE IS THE MAN? OUI! [SARCASTICALLY] AW, YOU ALWAYS PLAY WITH DOLLIES AND WEAR THE LITTLE DRESS? [DOLL CRIES] [GIGGLES] TELL US WHERE MADELINE IS! IF YOU DO NOT, IT WILL GO VERY HARD ON YOU. MMM!

NO ONE CAN GET DOWN HERE... TO HELP YOU. Narrator: WHILE MADELINE'S FATE HUNG BY A THREAD, HER FRIEND PEPITO WAS PLANNING AHEAD. La Croque: THAT'S THE OLDEST TRICK IN THE WORLD. THINK I'LL LOOK BACK? [CHUCKLES] THINK AGAIN! THERE IS NO ESCAPE. Narrator: WHILE HENRI'S CROOKED ACT WAS THROUGH, IN MISS CLAVEL'S MIND, THERE WAS STILL MUCH TO DO. IF ONLY THERE WERE JUST A CLUE... MONSIEUR, SURELY, IF YOU HELP, THE COURTS WILL NOT BE SO HARD ON YOU. WHAT IS IT YOU ARE SAYING? THEY WILL GIVE YOU A LIGHTER SENTENCE IF YOU LEAD US TO MADELINE. YOU CAN PROMISE THIS? HMM. ALL RIGHT. I'LL TELL YOU. I THINK YOU WILL LEAD US THERE. [MADELINE LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] LAUGHTER? YOU WILL NEVER LAUGH AT LA CROQUE AGAIN. Narrator: LUCKILY FOR MADELINE, PEPITO ACTED JUST IN TIME. UNH! AAH! [LAUGHING] OHH! [LA CROQUE GASPS] AAH! OHH! HELP! GET IT AWAY FROM ME! Narrator: AS LA CROQUE TRAPPED HERSELF IN THE LACE ON THE FLOOR, FIFI RUSHED OFF WITH THE KEY TO THE DOOR. HURRY! WE MUST HELP MADELINE! HURRY! TIE HER UP! Narrator: THE GIRLS AND PEPITO DASHED INTO THE SHOP JUST AS THE GENDARMES PULLED UP TO A STOP. La Croque: HORRIBLE CHILDREN! MADELINE, YOU ARE THE WORST OF ALL! VOILA! MY ANGEL. [KIDS CHATTERING] UNH! ARGH! MADELINE! MISS CLAVEL! Girls: AWW! MY LITTLE ONE. MES ENFANTS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? RESCUING MADELINE! [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] HENRI? [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] YOU RAT! IT WAS ALL HIS IDEA. IT WAS HIS SCHEME! EVERYTHING! OOH! La Croque: OOH, LET ME AT HIM. Narrator: AND THEN AT THAT INSTANT, HENRI TOOK FLIGHT. [BLOWS WHISTLE] Narrator: AS THE GENDARMES PURSUED HIM, HE DODGED LEFT AND RIGHT. THEN LA CROQUE JOINED THE CHASE WITH A WELL-POINTED KICK... HA! AAH! AND PEPITO PERFORMED AN OLD ARGENTINE TRICK. Pepito: ¡ARRIBA! WHOA-AAH! ¡OLE! WHOA-OH! OW! OOF! Girls: YAH! UNH! DAAH! A FITTING CURTAIN FOR A COWARD. [GASPS] [GIRLS LAUGH] All: YAY! [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] THERE WILL BE A SUBSTANTIAL REWARD FOR THE CAPTURE OF THIS ONE. Narrator: THE GENDARMES LED THE VILLAINS AWAY. THEIR MISDEEDS WERE ENDED. NOW THEY WOULD PAY. MY BRAVE MADELINE. I WAS BRAVE BECAUSE I HAD FRIENDS ALL AROUND ME. VOICI. LOOK. MAMA'S BEADS! ALL OF THEM. EACH AND EVERY ONE. [GIRLS CHATTERING] YOU WERE RIGHT, MISS CLAVEL. FAMILIES COME IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES. AND NOW I WANT TO GO HOME. [WOOF] Miss Clavel: OUI, MADELINE. HOME SOUNDS GOOD, NO? [GIGGLES] Narrator: THE VERY NEXT MORNING, THE OLD HOUSE WAS CHEERFUL, THOUGH MADELINE'S HAIRCUT WAS STILL A BIT FEARFUL. AS THE GIRLS LEFT THE HOUSE, MISS CLAVEL WAS IN SHOCK... [GASPS] WHEN SHE SAW THEY HAD ALL COPIED MADELINE'S LOCKS. [GASPS] [CHUCKLES] TRÈS BIEN, LITTLE GIRLS. WE ARE THANKFUL THAT MADELINE IS BACK WITH US SAFE AND SOUND. Girls: OUI, OUI! BONNE NUIT, MES PETITES. I HOPE YOU SLEEP WELL. Girls: GOOD NIGHT, GOOD NIGHT, DEAR MISS CLAVEL. YOU ARE LUCKY TO RECEIVE SUCH A LARGE REWARD FOR CAPTURING THOSE THIEVES, MADELINE. OUI, THAT IS TRUE. I KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITH THE REWARD MONEY. ME, TOO! I WOULD GO SHOPPING FOR WONDERFUL CLOTHES AND JEWELRY. AND TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD TO EXOTIC COUNTRIES. I WOULD HAVE A PRIVATE ZOO WITH ALL OF MY FAVORITE ANIMALS. OUI, THOSE ARE TEMPTING CHOICES, BUT I HAVE SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL IN MIND. Narrator: AT LAST IT ARRIVED, THAT WONDERFUL DAY WHEN ALL DREAMS CAME TRUE IN MADELINE'S WAY. [GIRLS GIGGLE] THEN LORD CUCUFACE PROUDLY STEPPED FORWARD TO SAY... MESDAMES, MESSIEURS, ET MES ENFANTS, IF I MAY, I NOW DECLARE THE NEW CITY SCHOOL FOR GIRLS, FUNDED SO GENEROUSLY BY OUR VERY OWN MADELINE, OFFICIALLY OPEN!
