EMMANUELLE 2 Follow me, ma'am. Here, ma'am, 72. - You joking? - No, is this your bag? But I got a 1st class cabin, not a dormitory. A collective cabin, exclusively reserved for ladies. Lucky for me. Sorry, it's not our fault. The agency must have made a mistake. Verify it yourself. See, place 72, deck 3. It's here, ma'am. But I paid for a 1st class ticket! All I can do is cancel the ticket. But you'll have to wait until next week to go 1st class. July 18th. No thanks, I prefer the dorm. At your service, ma'am. - Bon voyage. - Thank you. I reserved in 1st class, too. What imbeciles! Incompetent! Do you have a comb I can borrow? Of course. - Here. - Thank you. See you later. He doesn't know I'm coming. I'd like to call him now. - Call him? - Yes, my husband. - Where is he? - Hong Kong. I don't know if you know this, but you can't call from here, you send messages with this. Yes, I meant send a message. It's not really the same thing. You must be 3 miles from the coast to send a message, or have special permission from the Commander. It's maritime law, I can do nothing. They put me on the 3rd deck instead of 1st class. Also maritime law? What? You, in the dorm? That's horrible. - Please sit down. - Thank you. You should have asked for Igor. Yes, I'm Igor. When something's wrong, you ask for Igor and it'll be OK. Such as tonight, you'll sleep in my cabin. That's very nice. And you? Wherever, on a deck chair or in the Pasha's bathtub. It's OK. Write your message down, I'll send it out top priority. Beautiful, sensual handwriting, written by no less beautiful hands. Thank you! Don't fill that out, I'll take care of it. Has it been long since you've seen your husband? Two months. That's a long time! Is that maritime law too? If you change your mind, don't hesitate. Cabin 8, deck one. Bitch! Are you OK? No. - You're sick? - No. - Here. - I'm not thirsty! What's wrong? This place scares me. What? I can't hear you. I'm scared. There's nothing to be afraid of. Yes! All these women! Three women took me. Do you understand? No. Raped me. I was raped by 3 women. - Here? - No, not here. In Macau. I was in boarding school. I was 16. A virgin. I'd never had an orgasm. One night, I was in the library with a few girls. There were 3 of them. They were laughing. Three Filipinos. One held my arms behind my back, another held my face. She kissed me on the mouth. I wanted to bite her, but I was scared. I felt a hand under my dress, in my panties. I didn't want to. Then they all caressed me at once. I felt fingers enter me, hard, very hard. I came. It was all over school. Then, when girls came into my bed, I liked it. Do you understand? Hi, ma'am, we weren't expecting you. I know. Where's Mr. Jean? - On the veranda. - Thanks. You have soft hands, my little Wong. Continue. Oh yes, Mr. Jean! I'll continue! Is that good, Mr. Jean? Yes, that's very good. Very good. Mrs. Jean. You have a nice moustache, Mr. Engineer, but it stings. You wanted me to grow it. That's true. It looks good. Do you think so? I thought you arrived in 10 days. It's almost been 2 months, Jean. 63 days, to be precise. I couldn't stand it. I took the first boat. I hope you've adventures to tell me about. A lot. Like what? The adventures of a single woman in Bangkok. Hectic? Very hectic. Come on. I'm waiting for Wong to finish shaving me. - I'm going up. - See you soon. Hi. You know, it's dangerous if the fan falls in the water. Yes. I like bathing dangerously. What are you doing here? I'm taking my bath. Sorry, I forgot. Have you met? Not yet, but she saved my life. She's Emmanuelle. - Your wife! - Yes. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. - Pleased to meet you, sir. - Christopher. Are you English? A bit, by the women. Half and half. Go back to your pool. Lindbergh... Is it Christopher or Lindbergh? Lindbergh. He's a pilot, you know. A pilot! You always sleep with your propeller? It's a real love story. - I'll tell you. - Another time. What's up with the plane? Nothing, he deals a bit. Opium? No, art, I think. Isn't it risky having him here? Not at all, don't worry. - Is he staying long? - No, a few days. Fuck me. Dressed so I'd undress you? No, I have a meeting, I have to cancel it. Hello, Miss. I've a meeting with Mr. Piang in half an hour. Would it be possible to reschedule it? Because... Because his wife hasn't fucked him in 2 months! Are you crazy? What? No, someone else must be on the line. He already left. Too bad. Thank you. What is it? Do you want me to make love to you for 5 minutes? Now Hong Kong won't be thirsty anymore! I hope you like my article. Very nice. You exaggerate. I have to go now. Thanks for the cigar. - Bye, ma'am. - Bye, sir. Goodbye. See you soon. Do you like me? Not bad, front page. Not bad at all. Don't you think you should shave the moustache? No, do you? So go on, was it a pretty French woman? Yes, with great breasts and a fantastic body. And you... No, she did. She started off by telling me a boring rape story to turn me on. - This was in the dormitory? - Yes. - And no one saw you? - Yes... Where have you been 3 days? My wife, Emmanuelle. Emmanuelle, Laura. - Hi. - Hi. I'd imagined you differently. Good or bad? Bad, obviously. - Want a drink? - No, I have plans. I forgot to confirm for dinner at Peter's tomorrow. Bring Emmanuelle. With pleasure, ma'am. - See you tomorrow. - See you. Who's this Peter? Peter's the man Laura lives with. Did you do Laura? Yeah. Was it good? Yeah, really good. In water. In water? In a bathtub? No, in the sea. The sea... Like fish? Yeah, like fish. - It's hard? - Very. And did you come under water? Yes. Look at me. Look. Come here. Come. I love you. Me too. Breakfast? You have to eat it all, ma'am said you lost weight. - What is this? - Porridge, eggs and bacon, toast with honey and passion fruit. The special overworked frog man menu. There's the irony! Don't think I'm jealous, but it seems to me that your mermaid has the exclusivity on intoxicating depths while I get the bathtub or the shower. Speaking of my mermaid, we eat at Peter's tonight, remember? Yes, Laura's friend. Has your little Laura done this for you? No! I'd rather stay here. Me too, but it's too late. Too bad! Peter researches Asian musicals for UNESCO. His parties aren't bad. Come on, make me happy. Wear your blue dress. Isn't it a bit too sexy? I can't, it's in my suitcase. You can ask Wong to take you to town to buy a dress. What if I asked Christopher instead? Why not? He'll love it, it's right up his alley! - They're really pretty. - Yeah. You really like Asian woman, don't you? Did Jean tell you? Yes sir, I know all about you. I know that every night you go to some place called The Emerald Garden. The Jade Garden. And I know white women scare you. They don't scare me, I just like yellow ones better. Best friends repeat everything to their wives. I thought it'd stay between us. I'm Jean's best friend, and we share everything. It's different with a woman. Well, you see, it doesn't bother me that you're a man, quite the contrary. I could tell you you're sexy. I think you're very sexy! Don't be ridiculous. Me, sexy? Yes, you have a nice smile, great teeth, a large nose, which indicates virility, as does the neck, the shoulders... everything! Very sexy! Do you think I'm sexy? Want me to punch you? Good morning! What's that for? This is not for you. Good for very old Chinese gentlemen. I have something for you. Wait. This is for you. For beautiful ladies like you. Try it. - That's for my hair? - Yes. For her pubic hair! Will you mind your own business? No. Very good, very good. Magic. Give me your hand. Beautiful hands. Feel good? You like? Really good? Let's go, this is a trap, a prank store. And the good magic? Feel good? That tickles. OK. We take your stuff. Beautiful lady. Now try acupuncture for happiness. But I'm already happy. No, no, no. This is very special. For women only. First floor. Come with me. - Where? - It's on the first floor. Come on, come. I'm scared. We can still leave. I like being scared. Fantastic, isn't it? Aquatic... like little fish. - Jean told me. - And? Seems you swim well. So does Jean. He's talented, and has good taste. - You're very pretty. - Thanks. Asshole! Why'd you tell her? I tell her everything. And she's not jealous? She's intelligent. That was great! I knew very well you'd enjoy it. My daughter promised to join the dancers, but as usual, she let me down. That young girl over there? Yes, that's the little idiot over there. Anna-Maria. So I'll just repeat that you have a lovely house. And I'll repeat again that you're a lovely girl. Thank you. Excuse me, please. - Hello! - Hello, ma'am. It seems you refused to dance tonight? Yes, my dad's furious. He'll get over it. Would you make a spectacle of yourself in front of tourists? I would if I danced like that. It's easy, you need two fans and a very good teacher. Come to the school... I would like that. Did you like the show? Yes, very much. Yet they kept messing up! - Be available if we need you. - Of course. Good morning. - Can I do something for you? - You're very kind. Thank you, no. - Something wrong? - Nothing at all. Don't worry. Goodbye. What'd the inspector want? Nothing, it's a little visa problem. Cops are interested in you lately. Really? What now? An inspector came by the office, asked about you. What did you say? I vouched for you. Nice of you. It's the Boy Scout in me. I do a good deed per day. - It's not serious, I hope? - No, don't worry. Hey, that's my shirt! I didn't notice, I swear. It's ruined. Keep it. Snap out of it. - Want a beer? - Yeah. Thanks. You caress it like a woman. Tang Ling at Jade Garden said I caress her like a prop. Regarding the visit of those 2 men you saw earlier, I need to stay a bit longer than I thought. Is 4 more days OK with you? You're kidding. How's Emmanuelle? She's fine. It's the special acupuncture. I think she'll go back. If she liked it. She seemed to like it a lot. You don't mind an old man made her come with needles? Emmanuelle does as she likes. If someone jumps her, it's OK with you? First, no one jumps her. What do you call it? She chooses. That's just talk. Listen, I have no rights over Emmanuelle. She's free. So am I. You two are strange. It's too much for you? You'll never get it into your stubborn little head. I'm sorry, madam. One mustn't disturb the students when they're in their lessons. You have to wait in the study here. See you later. OK, that's it. Sorry about earlier, Naim's often rude to visitors. Are you still coming to class? Maybe. You think he's cute? He's very cute. He's your boyfriend? No, not at all. All the girls love him, but not me. Do you have a boyfriend? Yes, his name is Sam. He really loves me. Want to go talk about him over a cup of tea? - Yeah, OK. - Come on. Imagine the effort, the continual effort boys make. Pick-up lines, eye contact, pounding hearts, all that to slip a hand in a girl's pants. That's all they think of. Us too, no? At least I did. How they'd try... It turned me on. Is Jean your first love? My first love, but not the first one I made love to. The first time, it was a guy. I remember, he always wore big jackets. He was the nicest guy. He was so clumsy! He was unsure of himself, I said he was great! Were you with him long? Not really. It was just to lose my virginity. And then? I waited 6 months before doing it again. That one gave me my 1st orgasm. Want to come over? No, I'm a bit tired. Next time. You're not going further with Sam? What do you do? We kiss. - That's it? - Yes. Doesn't he want to go further? No. Liar. There's no Sam. I'm dumb. I invent stories while I dream. While touching yourself? No. Yes... Sometimes. Ma'am, your husband has a call. Yes, but he's playing right now. I'll go. Hi, beautiful! Hi, Jean. - Is Laura here? - Yes. You love Laura, don't you? No, what makes you think that? Nothing. I really like Emmanuelle. But there's something about you two I don't get. You play with love. If you mean we sleep around, and call that playing, then yes, we play. Isn't it dangerous? No. Sex isn't dangerous, love is. Here's a secret, I don't love Laura, I love Emmanuelle. And if you fall in love one day? Well, that's a risk, I like risks. So does Emmanuelle. She knows? Yes, I hide nothing. It's how a couple acts, no? I don't know. No lies, even by omission. I've no rights over Emmanuelle, her pleasure is mine. So, you're flirting? Oh shit! That's all I needed. What's wrong? - Did you hear about Nina? - No. - Singer? - Force 8 typhoon. Over Formosa, be here in 3 days. Why do they give that shit women's names? Why? Is it bad for you? No, but I have to leave fast. I have 2 days to take off. Where will you go? Australia. A problem? No, I don't think so. A typhoon won't mess you up? The drilling station's OK. May inspect it. Another time. Gotta go to the hangar, bye! Don't forget your prop. Thanks. Oh, my God! It's hotter in here than it is outside! I know! What heat! I slept all day. I couldn't even hold a pencil. Take us to the baths? Good idea. Coming? No, you two go on. I can't move. Be nice, Anna-Maria, I want you to come, indulge me. Are you coming? Which one do you want? I don't know. Whichever. I've chosen. Be nice, let Anna-Maria pick. It's her first time here. Which one? That one, I think. The one on the right. - Can I? - Of course. I'd have picked that one. I'm not surprised. Are you happy? I'm happy you're here. That both of you are here. There you are! I looked everywhere! Surprise, I'm going with you. - That's impossible. - Why? I have to work. It's not nice there. I'm leaving with you. Don't be stubborn. OK? Not OK. Let's go. - Want me to tell you? - What? I have a surprise for you, a real one. What surprise? Pack your bags, we're leaving tomorrow. - Where? - Bali. Bali! That's fantastic! Are you happy? OK, I'll leave you alone. The bags are ready, ma'am. Here's your red dress. I think I'll order a white dress with red stripes. No, brown. Wong, bring my wig, I have an idea. There, Mrs. Jean, you're a real girl from heaven! You think so? Now Mrs. Jean is prettiest Chinese girl in Hong Kong. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello. Is Mr. Christopher there? No, sir, hold on a moment. Do you know where Mr. Christopher is? Hello, sir. I don't know where he is. It's very urgent. He must contact Mr. Ming. Understand? Ming. Quickly. Otherwise he'll... Just tell him to contact Ming. That's it. Goodnight, ma'am. Listen, it's very important. You don't know where Christopher is? Maybe Jade Garden, ma'am. Jade Garden. Is it far? No, very close. Listen, I'll explain. You go there, and find Mr. Christopher. Tell him Ming called, Mr. Ming. No, ma'am, I can't go to Jade Garden. Why not? I'm scared. - Can I go upstairs, please? - No, no. You can't. - But my friend's inside. - No, no. You have to be with somebody to go inside. Can I help you? No, thanks, I'll handle it. I'm looking for a date. She's looking for a date! She's my sister! Why're you here dressed as a whore? - Ming called. - So? Sorry. He said you had to call him. Screw Ming. This place excites you. What's with you? Is it this manly fair that puts you in this state? Is it illegal to get excited, or just reserved for men? Women here are paid to make other people come. Stupid idiot. And women? They're just machines to fuck for you. You think you hate them, but they scare you. She's with me, OK? Get out. What's this? We pay for girls with it. Do you realize you're paying for girls with casino chips? Don't you think it's pathetic? Are you done yelling at me? Let's go. You know I leave tomorrow. I'm staying, I want to make love. Me too. Too late Christopher. I really wanted you, but I make love to whom I want, when I want. Bye! It's the immaculate virgin! Why are you here at this hour? I don't get along with dad, I left home. Finally! Bravo! Are you leaving? Can you hand me that shirt? You're lucky I'm going, I'd love to get you between the sheets. You too? Yeah, me too. Thank Jean for his shirt and Emmanuelle for her moral lessons. Emmanuelle gave you lessons in morality? Yes, a real philosophy professor. This is for the road. What? You're not gonna cry. What are you afraid of? Men still? You're 18, you're pretty, superb, among all the toads, you'll meet Prince Charming one day. Bye, cutie. Oh, Emmanuelle! I didn't want to wake you. I got into a fight with my dad. I left home. I didn't know where to go. You were right to come here. You'll tell me about it. Your dress is cute. Christopher left. I know. I'm sad. Things will work out. We're going to Bali tomorrow, you'll come with us. Jean's not sleeping here tonight. Do you want to sleep with me? No. I'd rather stay here. I'm fine, I promise. What's Anna-Maria doing here? She had a fight with her dad, wanted to sleep on the sofa. I'm beat. She's coming to Bali with us. You look great! Yeah, I'm good. I went to the Jade Garden last night. I saw Christopher. - He didn't leave? - Yes. And you slept with him? No. Well, what did you do? What did I do? I slept with three men. Really? - Was it good? - I'll show you. - Did you get paid? - Yes! How much? A lot! Tell me. Go on, tell me. Tell me, that boy who's with Anna-Maria... - Who? Michael? - Yes, Michael. She likes him? Are you jealous? No, I want her. She excites me. What did you say? I said Anna-Maria excites me. Do you think she likes you? Are you gonna answer? You must ask her. How about her eyes? Blue. And her nose, her mouth... Stop, you're turning me on! Her legs, her breasts... I can't take it! Are you sure? Come on then. I'm coming. The little sluts. Is it true what you said? No, not at all. You're ugly, I don't like you. - I hate you! - Me too.
