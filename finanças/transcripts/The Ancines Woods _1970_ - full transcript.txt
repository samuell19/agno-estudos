If I may have your attention to tell this tale Which happened here in Galicia at the turn of the century Benito Freire was a peddler at the fairs He'd guide the travelers from town to town Fourth Sorrowful Mystery. Jesus Carrying the Cross. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy Name, thy kingdom come... Damn kid, come here! THE ANCINES WOODS - Who died? - Jose?no Vigairo. Rest in peace. The bad spirits have now left. Praise the Lord. My son Jose?no. Nothing could be done, even though we called the faith healer. We even prayed St. Mary's Ninth. Just 17. See for yourself. He was about to become a worthy man. And now? Have patience and shuffle the cards, Mr. Vigairo. My Jose?no! Those of us still alive have to get on with life. What has life done for me? Four boys I had, each as bright as the sun. And all four are gone. "Get on with life. " Resignation, Vigaira, resignation. Avelina. How's the aunt? Trenca? Like a queen. I left her in the best house on the mountain. I bring you a letter from her. The bailiff wrote it and I didn't even read it, out of respect. And because my reading is not that good. Give it to me. You'll get it as soon as we get to Vigairo's house. There's no land like that one, I tell you. Soup? They feed it to the hogs. No offence meant, but I think everyone should move over there. It's typical, if you'll pardon the comparison... of animals to want to stay in their own stable. It's a land of plenty, and your aunt is well-off there... Even Rosa and Manuela are well-off. They have bellies this size. What about the letter, Benitino? Here it is, for whomever understands it. I'll read it. "My most unforgettable goddaughter Avelina: "I hope this letter reaches you when you are in good health. "Mine is good, thank God. Same goes for Rosa and Manuela... "who live half a league from me. "This is to let you know how fortunate I am to be serving at this master's house, "who's a rich man that brought back a good number of doubloons from Cuba. "Well, goddaughter, if it be your will to come to these lands... "you'll lack nothing, as you're as dear to me as a daughter. "You can travel with Benito Freire, who knows the road well. "He's a righteous and worthy man. "Sell your things, and if that's not possible... "don't worry, as this gentleman will provide for you... "and also for your daughter Teresa, if you bring her. "Don't hesitate, as I'm well-off here. "Your dearest godmother sends you her love, "Primitiva. " That's the gospel. Trenca was fortunate. The land over there is by the sea. And the ships from Veracruz come loaded with silver and fine pearls... it's a blessing. If you want advice, mine is for you to go. It's a good deal for a single girl with a daughter. Though you're free to do whatever you want, Avelina. If only I were healthier and better at making decisions. I'd be there like Trenca, living the good life. I'd go, but what would become of my poor child? She can stay with Vigaira until you beckon her. Think about it, Avelina, think about it. Oh my God, I can't stop thinking about my Teresa. But if things turn out all right like you say, Benito... You'll soon bring her to me. Benito! Benito! What's the matter? Saint cards blessed with the true effigy of Santa Eufemia, protector from evil! Color ribbons brought from the Court! Scapulars with relics and shells from St James! Needles and fine threads! Saint cards blessed with the true effigy of Santa Eufemia, protector from evil! Clothes of all sizes! Scapulars with relics! Shells from St James! Clothes of all sizes! Color ribbons brought from the Court! Needles and fine threads! You'll have the answer tonight. A little kiss! A little kiss! No kisses! I'll sing you a lullaby! And tell Don Nicol?s that I need to see him. Letters aren't enough. May God reward you, madam. Go back, Dona Pacucha, someone might see us... and misunderstand the situation, then go and tell your uncle the Abbot. Don't worry, madam. I'll do my duty as usual. Get to Astorga safely and hasten back. God will reward you, faithful Benito. As you know, Dona Pacucha, I'm always willing. Pacucha! So you had forgotten him. Sit down, Pacucha. And don't deny it. Once again with that Valc?rcel. When will you realize that a courtship like that is no good for you? What do you know about him that somebody who knew him well here doesn't know? He achieved a just reputation as a rake. He spoke big words to you, but then... letters and letters... and... just letters... for years... secret letters! His father was ill, very ill. And he's the elder among eleven brothers. - Then his father died... - No need to hide something like that. Pacucha, just think that during all these years... it was very hard not to find an opportunity... just one... to see you again and talk to me. If, as you say, he's really interested. Marriage is not something to be taken lightly. One day you'll thank me. And don't think I speak thus because I fear being left alone at my age... and in my health. I only seek your happiness. And I know that you won't be happy anywhere as you are here. Think about it. That man is no good for you. I'm off, Pacucha. I can see you understand me, and that makes me glad. God bless. Go on with the party, nothing's happened. Don't overdo it! Don't overdo it, Benito Freire! - I was going to buy it from you. - It's not for sale. How the devil is something Benito Freire carries not for sale? Or is there a story behind that shawl? Story? What do you mean? Something you take care of in between all your travels. What do you know? Our saint has a double life! You're wrong, Queiruga. The shawl... - That's it, go on, and explain the shawl! - There's nothing to explain. It's just... your imagination. Here! Keep it forever! If you keep quiet and don't let anyone know I gave you a gift! Benitinio, darling! I never dreamt i could have such a fine thing. During the night he'd commit all sorts of crimes, protected by the night and the skin of a wolf he had killed. And at dawn he'd shed his wolf skin and return to his human activities. Nobody who saw him suspected his night-time adventures, which took place mostly under a full moon. He'd hang the wolf skin carefully, avoiding both cold and heat, because he felt the skin as if it really was his own. The prudish Englishman. - Good evening. - You're here again, Don Robertino! Have a seat, I suppose you came for supper. If I'm not disturbing at this time of night. No trouble at all. The pot's on the fire and we always have something hot ready. I can see that this last trip wasn't bad. No, not bad at all. I said that because you're almost out of Bibles. I have more on the mule. She's injured so I left her at the blacksmith's. Well, well... Please go on. Don't interrupt your conversation on my account. It's just that you were talking about something really interesting. We thought that you Protestants... Please go on. I'm a man like any other, very curious regarding human beings. - We were talking about werewolves. - Go on, go on. We were each telling a story. I spoke about one that appeared in Jallas. The story I will tell has never been heard. I was a lad when I met the wretch. And I was as near to him as I am to all of you now. They were seven brothers, all boys. And no girls among them. And this one, who was the youngest... had the misfortune of being a werewolf... for seven years. And the strangest thing was that no one could harm him during that time. Because the curse had to stand. One day, after several killings in Santiso, he tried to enter a mill, still in his wolf guise. And when he got his leg beneath the gate, the miller came and cut it off. Then he started to scream, and became a man again. But he was a cripple. And that was the last time for him as a wolf. You should have seen him crying, full of remorse over all the killings. He'd swear and swear that God had wanted it that way. And that he couldn't help it. But even with the hex gone, people would utter the recommended incantation for these cases: "Entrust yourself to God and to St Mary, "and to his Precious Son, born from her. "And to St Sylvester and to the 37 angels. "May God always deliver us from snakes and serpents. "And from all bad things, and from cruel men... "and from the rabid wolf. " I can see it, of course I can see it. You have to leave her here until you leave. I can just see myself carrying the load, or part of it. I'll leave some things here, if you don't mind. - Of course, sir, as you wish. - Thank you. Is it going all right? At least I'll have some company during the trip. - May God be with you. - Until the next time. I noticed last night that while they were telling their tales you kept quiet. I often think that us travelers; me, with my Bibles, and you, with your wares from town to town, seem to have different ideas about things. Traveling, my friend Freire, educates you. Culture! I've traveled and have comrades in many parts of the world doing the same job. And everywhere you go there are legends that have never been proven. For example, that absurd superstition about lycanthropy. It's nothing new. Even the Classics broached the subject. Ovid wrote something about it. So did Herodotus, Virgil and Petronius. What is strange is the fear it arouses among you. I think the alleged werewolves probably suffer from epilepsy, or "palsy" as you prefer to call it. Which is a disease that's been researched... I don't believe in these fantasies, nor do you, as I recall from last night... when I was watching you. Don't you believe - like I do - that all that talk was just superstition, rooted in the poverty and ignorance of these people? Look, look! Don Nicol?s de Valc?rcel? Dad, dad, they're asking for you! Excuse me. I bring a letter from Dona Pacucha. First thing I do is deliver it, despite the fever I caught in Galicia... It's a miracle that I'm still on my feet. And I do it all to accomplish my mission. Don Nicol?s, I hope you won't get me wrong or get upset... - I'd like to ask a favor. - Tell me Freire, tell me. Even though I'm not from these parts... Could you help me get into the hospital, to cure my fever? You can count on it, Freire. You can count on it. Go to the hospital and tell them I sent you... you'll be well taken care of. Now go in peace and get better. - What about the reply? - The reply? Don't worry, Freire. I'll take it myself to the hospital. Now go and get better, that's what matters. - God bless you, Don Nicol?s. - Goodbye, Freire. Pacucha, again? We'll talk about it later. Clean inside and out. That's it. You can thank the Lord. - Good morning, Don Nicol?s. - Good morning, sister. - Hello, Ram?n. - Good morning. Good morning, Don Nicol?s. Good indeed, my friend Freire. I've heard good things about your health. You gave us a good scare. We thought you were a dead man. But fortunately, we're all very happy to see you have recovered. Oh, indeed, before I forget. For "that client" who's expecting a reply. Good "client", for sure. Tell her it's my wish... for the relationship to continue as it is. Even though I'd like to see it improve. You shouldn't have bothered, Don Nicol?s. Tomorrow, I'll be discharged... I thought I'd visit your mother-in-law to stock up on merchandise and... - as long as I was at it... - No bother at all, Freire. Not at all. As a matter of fact today we're having a Hospital Council meeting. Now, in five minutes. Now, dear Freire. Time to grow strong. May the Lord be with you. May God repay you, Don Nicol?s. Good morning. Freire! Blessed are the eyes that gaze upon you! Through my son-in-law we've been keeping up to date on your illness. You know you're welcome at this house. We've known you for so long... - If you'll excuse me... - Yes, sit down, sit down. And take a deep breath, you seem exhausted. It's only natural, after all you've been through... So. You've come to stock up as usual, right? Let's leave it for later. I'll bring you some brandy that would raise the dead. Don't bother, Dona Garav?a. My fatigue will go away just by sitting down. This time, my order is smaller. Business has been slow lately. "Twelve saint candles, scapulars... "a black twill piece... "lace strips, rosaries... "Saint cards, strips of... " Thief! I was right about the kind of person you were! Damned peddler! How did that music box wind up there? - Enough, dear! Let him explain himself. - Yes, let him explain himself! Well? We're waiting. Don Nicol?s promised he'd give it to me. In exchange for this! "My darling Pacucha: " My God! Hi, Benito. - Here again? - That's right. Yes, that's fine. It's Benito Freire! A good afternoon to you. Don Gravier. I knew that you'd be with us for Saint Cosme. Teresa. Teresa! Come here, little one. Yes, Abbot? We wanted to see you to hear about Avelina. And also to see what we'll do about the child. How is Avelina? Like a lady at a house that belongs to the brother of Trenca's master. She lacks nothing and only yearns to have Teresinia by her side. - Didn't she send me a message? - No. Will you be staying long? I'll sell what I can and then... Right. Well, give us hand. We'll talk about the girl with Vigaira. Although I know she'll say that Teresinia is best off with her. Go and help Minguinios, he's in there. Run off and play! Hi, Mr. Benito! How are you, Minguinios? Still with those fantasies in your head? Dreaming about the sea and the ships. Wait... let me do it. Mr. Benito. Tell me a story. Let me tell you that on my last trip to the mountains... I reached the sea. It's blue there, and it expands beyond what the eyes can see. It's really impressive. Now pay attention to what I'll tell you. Of all things that Benito Freire has seen... nothing compares to looking at the sea. You never get tired of it. Mr. Benito, if you don't have a place to spend the night... My mother now has an inn. You'll be fine there. We'll see. We'll see later. Listen, Minguinios... a captain on his ship is like the town mayor... or better, like the mayor and the priest together... and the high seas is just water everywhere, no land in sight... - Furthermore... - Go on, Mr. Benito, go on. We've hunted down the werewolf! Death to the werewolf! Death to the werewolf! If only all days were like this one, my dear Benito. Like nothing. Everything sold out in less than two hours. Well, sold out... but keep in mind, Mr. Abbot, that I didn't bring a full trunk. But I'm not complaining, St Cosme has been good. Now that we're all relaxed, tell us how Avelina is doing. Well, to tell you, I mean to really tell you... I can't say much, as I had to return very soon... and I hardly spent a day at the house... What I know is that when I left there was a feast. And what a feast! The master is liberal, so the poor get invited! I've seen them tumbling down over the tombs due to cider alcohol! Benito, Benito! Come on, Minguinios, let's prepare the Queimada punch. What did you say Avelina's master's name was? The... last name is very long... I don't know it very well... But people call him Don Francisco de Paula. I think we should talk about the little girl's future. She won't be better off anywhere else. But if her mother beckons her, and, as Benito says, they live so well there... I'd like to see that for myself. Enough with the arguing. We're trying to fix this, not to make it worse. My opinion is that the child should be with her mother. Especially as we know that she's well-off there. No one asked me, but I agree with the Abbot. We have to remember that her mother had a bad time here. And now she's doing fine. And what about the trip? Because I believe - and no offence meant - that it's not right for such a young girl to travel with a grown-up man. But you know what? If it comes to that, I'm willing to chaperone the child. I don't want her to regret her destiny one day... as I've done so many times. Yes, I'm willing. It's better late than never... and I have nothing to keep me here. And Trenca lives in those mountains, she's my niece. I don't think it's... necessary for Riquitina to come... because... and also no offence meant... of all my travels as a guide - some of them carrying children in my arms - I never ever got a complaint. That's not the point, Benito. Nobody doubts you here. But my advice is that if Riquitina has made such a decision... the child will be better off with two respected persons than with one. Minguinios, the herbs. I don't mean to fool you, it's a rough trip and hardship can be expected. And in all good faith I think you're out of your wits if you insist on the trip. Let's speak no further on the subject, Benito. We'll all feel more assured if Riquitina travels with you. Is it true, Mr. Benito, that some ships on the sea are bigger than our church? Benitinio, don't forget about my medicine when you see the healer. I'll really need it now that they're taking Teresa away. This is about ready. Let's toast to that trip! Minguinios! What brings you here? What brings you here? Mr. Benito, I want to go with you. Go back right now or I'll split your head in two! Go away! Go away, you wretch! Go, get out of here now! Riquitina and Teresa went to fetch water! Greetings, grandmother. Come in, peddler, and tell me what you want. I have to take to Vigaira some medicine which she said you know about. This is the medicine. Benitinio... Benito Freire. You don't look good, peddler. You don't look after yourself like everyone should. Especially you, who was cursed as a child. Now you're scared of the healer who held you in her arms. Just by looking at you... I can see that you're not taking my medicine for your ailment. Benitinio, you won't reach old age if you don't take care of your health. Minguinios, child! Where have you come from, damn you? I'll... Do you know how you made your mother cry? And all your father's spoken sins because of you? Let's see. Where have you been? And why on earth did you leave? Speak up, Minguinios! I trailed Mr. Benito. I wanted to see the sea. So Benito brought you back by an ear. No, Mr. Abbot. I came back alone. What of Benito? I escaped from him. Look, Minguinios, stop it with the tales! So, you trailed him, and now you're telling me you escaped from him! It's true, Mr. Abbot. When I met him in the woods... he threatened me and told me he'd break my head... with a rock he picked up from the ground. He told me to go back to the town and other things I didn't understand. You lie, you wretch! Benito is incapable of threatening you. He's as good as gold. I know that for a fact. And don't damn yourself by telling lies! Everything will come to light when Freire comes back from Castile! It's the truth, Mr. Abbot. He was so angry, I thought he wanted to kill me. Didn't Riquitina come to defend you? Or was she also furious? Mr. Benito was alone when I woke him up. Believe me, Mr. Abbot. May my mother perish if I'm lying. And so she will, you wretch, if you keep on upsetting her! And I'm through speaking. Your father will set you right! Come home with me, Mr. Abbot. My father will kill me. You have it coming! And it won't be enough to wash away your sins. All right. I'll go with you so worse doesn't come to worst. Wait for me here. The way you look, it's better if no one sees you at Mass. So, you say that he's extremely melancholic? My God! What joy! And didn't he... send a special message? Take me with you. Dona Pacucha! If he can't come to me, I'll make the trip myself. I've made up my mind! What about the Abbot? Forget about him. It's my life, my own business! - Have you thought about it? - For years and years. We'll leave this same night. Come to my house in an hour. To your house? What about your uncle, the Abbot? He's away. He traveled for a funeral and won't be back for a few days. - I'll see you later, Benito. - May God be with you, Dona Pacucha. If we need supplies for the road, just grab them. You'll know better than me what's necessary. In the midst of all the flowers, flowers, flowers just like a daughter of love, yes, of love The birth of dear Corina, yes, Corina the daughter of love. Benito! Come here! Get on! You never miss one! So? You have nothing to say? We haven't seen each other in months, and this is what I get. So many trips, and you have nothing to say. Look... Benito Freire. Nobody pulls the wool over my eyes. I know my way around. I travel here and there just like you. So, you'll sell all this stuff? If it wasn't because I've got my hands full I'd even help you out. I could even teach you a thing or two about selling. Remember that damned shawl you gave me? What shawl? What do you mean "what shawl"? You made quite a fuss about it. - I remember. - Well, I sold it. I sold it yesterday to someone who took a fancy to it. I told him it was your keepsake, but it was useless. Who was it, who was the man? Lameiro, the delivery man. He's sort of one-eyed. Do you know him? I want to know about the owner of this. I'll try to help you, though this is not really for a healer. I think I'll be able to divine the owner's fate. I see blood around her. I'll need the owner's name. Avelina de Souto, who traveled to Castile. Was she wearing the shawl when she left? - Yes. - Was she traveling alone? No, with Benito Freire. Benito Freire the peddler. I know him. When he was a child, he had an ailment which was never cured. Do you know if Benito Freire traveled in good health? - Is Don Gabriel in? - Yes, sir. Come with me. - Hello there. - Good day to you. How is Don Cipriano? In bed, because of the asthma he gets when he's upset. And what's he upset about? As a matter of fact I'm here to ask you to see him as soon as you can. Is he feeling that bad? Not worse than before. But he asked for you to see him as soon as you can. All right, Bouso. Do you know why he wants to see me? Well... as far as knowing... I don't know anything... But I know what the whole town is talking about. And what is that? Dona Pacucha, who suddenly left town. - Minguinios, go to the vestry and clean up the dust! - Yes, Father. There's talk that... she left for Astorga, to meet a certain Valc?rcel... who was her fianc? years ago. Right. And what do I have to do with it? You... I think it's because of Freire. Freire? Benito Freire, the peddler? What's the matter with him? He's the one that guided Dona Pacucha, he knows all the shortcuts. Freire mixed up in that? Impossible. Don't go on Bouso, don't. Yes, Mr. Abbot. Benito Freire. The very same one. Some have seen him with Senorita Bilouzas. And through some that followed him for a while, Don Cipriano found out. As far as i know, the Abbot wants data on the peddler and on his routes. If they didn't travel the King's Highway it'll be hard for the Law to find them. But Freire is on his way to Santander with two females from my parish. And you're sure it was Freire who was traveling with the lady? I didn't see them myself. But I know the witnesses. And nobody was with him when he was with Pacucha or on the way to Astorga? Nobody with Freire, either before or after, with two women... one an elderly women, and the other almost a child. Nobody I know of, Mr. Abbot. At least nobody's talking about it. All right, Bouso. Tell the Abbot I'll go and see him very soon. And be sure I've heard nothing of what you've told me. - May the Lord be with you, Bouso. - And you too, Mr. Abbot. Minguinios! Minguinios! Get over here! Listen, son. You're going to tell me again how you found Benito Freire asleep in the woods. - Mary, Mother of God! - Conceived without sin. - Going hunting? - Exactly, son. You'd be better off with some dogs by your side. You're right, but I'll just be exploring. God be with you. We'll soon know what it's all about. Come out whoever you are! Please don't shoot. It's me, Mr. Abbot. What are you doing here, Lameiro? What are you doing so far from town? Alas, Don Gabriel! I'm afraid we're both after the same thing. Teresinia! And you, Lameiro, how did you come to suspect this? Come on! Get on your horses! All pay attention to my orders. We have to hunt him down whatever it takes. When the right time comes, we'll split into groups. Understood? I've told you more than once I don't want to see you in my parish. I can be useful at this time. Benito, poor wretch! We have to hurry! We need to cross the woods before dusk. That way. Let's leave the horses here. Let's split into groups as I said before. Let's go. Look! There he is! Open the trap. Thank you! Thank you! All the hunters are taking Benito away the werewolf is the prey the hunting party's gathered. And thus came the end of the curse of Benito the werewolf who through a curse of fate was charged with eleven murders. Peace returned to the region and we thank you O Lord and thank you for your attention that's the end of the story. The events in this film are authentic. Only the names have been changed. Benito Freire was sentenced to death by a court in La Coru?a. Locations subtitles: scalisto for the KG tracker.
