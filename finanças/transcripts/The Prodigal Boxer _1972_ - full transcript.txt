(waves crashing) (dramatic music) (crickets chirping) (people chattering) - Not a chance. (people chattering) Hey, come on. There's no point in stopping it now. Just put that away. - Damn you! It's a fix! You're going to have to pay me for that cricket. - Huh? Now come on. It was a fair match. What is this? - Yeah, you deaf? You heard him. You're going to have to pay him compensation. (men shouting) (punches thudding) (dramatic music) - The best thing you guys can do is go get a doctor. - Let's go, huh? - Yeah, come on. - Hey, hey, you all right? (people chattering) - Fang Shih-Yu, you killed him. (men shouting) (punches thudding) - Hey, teacher. - Teacher. - I think it's safe to say that my brother I are probably the best teachers in the province. He trains the feet, and I the fist. So if you practice hard, and do what you're told, you won't be beaten. - Wait. - Hey, what's wrong? - Don't talk too soon. - Hey, what's happened? Mai got into a fight last night, and he's probably not going to live. As you know, he was one of the best students we had here. - Do we know who did it? - Who do you guess would do it? - Fang Shih-Yu. - They've had some trouble before. I know Mai wanted to kill him. - Let's get him. - But we can't let him get away with it, otherwise we lose a lot of face. - Listen, that boy's a very tough character, you know. (screams) - Hya! Ma, is that enough? - Not yet. Go on, you practice that. - Hmm. What's this? It's something new. - I know that. It's for you. I had it made specially for you. - Right. I'll give it a try, but then I rest. Hya! Hey! - You see? It's just what you need. It'll sharpen your eye and your ears. - Hya! Ma! How about that! I got it! Pretty good, huh? - Yes. (whistles) - Can I stop now? I need a drink. - I'll get you some tea. You stay right where you are. Anyway, you're not going off with your friends, for sure. They can whistle all day if they want. You're not going. (whistles) Ma, I made a date, though. - Sorry. You'll only get into some fight, like always. (whistles) - Hya! (dramatic music) - Damn it! Fang Shih-Yu can't make it, so let's go. - Hey, hey, hey, not me! Try and face that gang, and without Shih-Yu? You must be crazy. What's keeping him? (whistles) - Hey, there's no use waiting here. Fang Shih-Yu is too scared of his ma. We're wasting our time. He won't come. Let's go. - Are you going? - I'm not going to let them laugh at me. - Right. If you can manage to beat me, you can go. I, I don't want to fight you. - Huh. You want to rush out and take on the whole world. But you don't want to fight with me, because you're too scared of me. - Well, if that's what you want. - Get down! - Ma, you said that I had to beat you. You didn't say how. Well, I think I've done it. And if you don't agree, come and get me. - You! Come down! (laughing) - I won't be very long! - What's going on? What can I help you? - Yes, sir, can I help you? - Where's Fang Shih-Yu? - I'll get him. I'll get him. - What's this? What's going on? - We've come for Fang Shih-Yu. - Oh, so you've come to make trouble. But why, though? He's only a boy. - That so? And just who are you? - I'm his father. Let go. Let go. - Well, let me show you what we want him for. - What do you want here? What is this? - See, he's just a boy, but you claim he's done you some injury. We'll see. If so, we'll pay compensation. - Sure, sure. - Right. Your son has killed a man, beat him up for no good reason. That's why we're going to take him to the police. - That fellow was one of the students. Your son murdered him. - Well, that's what you say. But if he did, then you'll- (all shouting) (punches thudding) - Are you hurt? - Shih-Yu! (mumbles) (all shouting) (punches thudding) - Hold it! (all shouting) (punches thudding) - Ah, serve him right. He had that coming to him. That's Chien Nu, a real pig. A few days ago, he and his gang robbed a couple of women travelers here. But Fang Shih-Yu found out. He's trying to find out where the stuff is to give it back to the women. - Yeah, good! - Where is it, huh? - We sold it all. We sold it. (crowd applauding) - Well done, well done. - We sold all the luggage, but we haven't spent a cent of the money. I swear, it's, it's all here, all of it. - That better be the truth, or you're gonna be in trouble. Now, how do we find these women? - I think they're still staying down at the hotel, so let's take the money to them. - A good idea. Let's go and find them. But we need some witnesses, though. (all shouting) - You did it, you did it. (sobbing) - I'm sorry, but the body will have to be moved out. - No, you can't move her until I can arrange a proper burial. You can't move her. - Come on, you can't even pay for your room here, let alone pay for a proper funeral. (laughing) - Yeah, that's great, huh? - You kicked the hell out of that one. (laughing) (sobbing) - Well, you got here too late. The girl's mother decided to hang herself this afternoon. - God damn them all! I should have killed them. Look, I know how you feel. You can come to my place, and stay with my mother. She'll fix up the funeral. - Ma, I'm sorry that I made you mad. Didn't mean to. I just wanted to help these women out. Ma, I'll work harder. Look, I'll practice every day, as much as you want. I'll really work on those dummies. Now ma, don't hit me, does no good, just hurts your hands. Ma? Ma! What's wrong? - See. Your dad's dead. - Huh? (laughing) Ma, Dad! Tell me how he died. Talk! Tell me how he died. Talk, damn you, talk! - The men came here and beat him to death. - Well, who was it? - I'll tell you later. - Tell me now. Tell me who did it. - I'll tell you later, when you're ready. Go and get your things. We're leaving here. - Wait! - Ma, won't you avenge him? - Yes, but we'll wait till you're good enough to do it. - I'm strong enough to do it right now. Look, I can do it. I know. - No, you won't have a chance with them. - But I've got to try. Even if I die, my father lying dead there, I can try it. I've got to. - Listen, son, you need more training yet, just for a year, then you can take revenge. - I won't! - Look, don't be upset. I must go. - I can't help it. I'm so frightened of losing you. I lost my husband today. And now you're going, too. - No, I'll do what you ask me. (laughing) Now, come on, huh? Look, this stuff isn't worth that much. I'll tell you my last offer. I'll give you 300 taels. - You what? 300? You have got to be joking. That's all first-class merchandise there, some really valuable stuff. That lion, that's worth a 1,000 taels itself. - Well, maybe in a shop it is, but this is stolen stuff. That makes a difference. - Yeah, yeah, but you know plenty of rich folk around here would like to buy it. You can easily get rid of it, or make a nice, fat profit as well. So don't be so damn greedy. We had to risk our lives to steal that, you know? - Well, in that case, you sell it somewhere else. - Oh, now hold it, you're my only friends around here, and you know it. I daren't travel around too much by myself. I'd be arrested. So then I've gotta sell to you fellows. Come on, now be fair, 3,000. At that price, you'll be able to make a clear 10,000 on it. All right? - Mm-mm. Go on. (dramatic music) - Hya! (all shouting) (punches thudding) - Well, now. Not here. - Damn you! (laughing) - Everybody's going to be grateful to us for getting rid of a bandit like you. (men shouting) (punches thudding) (mumbles) - We kept our word. We've avenged your son. We killed Fang Shih-Yu's father. I'm afraid that he and his mother managed to get away. - Take a seat, please. I want you to fetch me Fang Shih-Yu's body, or else my son's soul will know no rest. (laughing) - Don't you worry now. My brother and I can fix that up. There's no one in the whole province can stand up to the two of us. - We'll have inquiries made. We'll soon find out where they are now. - I'd like to give you something. - Oh, well, thank you, sir. But we don't want to get paid for avenging your son, though. We did it because we felt that we had to. After all, he was one of our students. Nevertheless, we have spent a lot of money on building this school. So to raise money, we'd like to sell some of our antiques. It occurred to me you might like to buy some. We'd certainly be willing to give you a good price, honest. - Of course. - All right, bring them in, will you? - Sure. (mumbles) I've just come up from the village. I believe that you're looking for a new maid, so I brought one. She's a hard-working girl. - Right. Take her to see the housekeeper. - All right. Come on. - You wait here. I won't be long. Don't go away. (men shouting) (man shouting) (punches thudding) - (mumbles) come on! What's wrong? - All right, who killed my father? - Uh, (mumbles), we, we know how you must be feeling. We've just come from burying your father, but your, your mother's ordered us not to tell you anything. - Can't tell you, that's right, sir, can't tell. - Come on. Tell me who killed him. - We can't, we can't, sir. - In that case, I'll have to assume that you did it. - No, no, no, no. - Tell me. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right. - Tell me. - All right, all right. It was Iron Fist Tan and his brother. They did it. (choking) (dramatic music) - What's wrong? You've told the boy? - Oh, we didn't have any choice, though, said he'd kill us. So then we had to tell him. - I should have known. Quickly, see if he's already gone. Hurry. - Yes. (dramatic music continues) (men shouting) (punches thudding) - Fang Shih-Yu! - Where are my foes? Come on, then, tell me! - They've both gone out. What do you want? - I want their lives. (all shouting) (punches thudding) Brother Tan, where are you? Come out! (men shouting) (punches thudding) You! Tell me where to find him! - They're, they're, they're in the hotel. - Get after him! - Fang Shih-Yu. (dramatic music) (people chattering) - Just take one, the jade lion. It's worth 3,000 now. - Maybe, but still, he's a friend. So say, then, 1,500, shall we? - This way, sir. (people chattering) - Hya! - What, what's happening? What's happening? - Fang Shih-Yu! - Wait! Let's not fight here. Let's find a better place. - Now listen. He's only a young kid. Why fight him? - Huh. We've got some very old scores to settle. (bright music) - Aah! Aah, oh! - Fang Shih-Yu's been here. Where is he? - He, he's gone now. - You lie. - Oh, no. He went off to look for the two teachers. I hope he's all right. - Who are you? - My name's Shiao Ping. Fang Shih-Yu helped me once. Also, he said his mother would help me. After that, he disappeared. Tell me, are you his mother? - Mm-hm. I'll take you to see him. - This looks like a good place. - Hmm. Fang Shih-Yu, I think this is where we're going to bury you. - Hya! (men shouting) (punches thudding) (groaning) - Stop it! Stop it! - Oh! - Stop it! Shih-Yu! Shih-Yu! - Please, make them stop. - That's enough. That's enough. What the hell are you doing? Are you trying to murder that boy? Come on, don't you have any sense of decency? - Oh, It was just a fight, nothing more. All right. All right. (murmuring) - Mrs. Hua, now you listen. We didn't pick the fight. Your son did, you got that? And so if he does die, it isn't our fault. - Shih-Yu! - Fang Shih-Yu! - Leave him. You go down to the village to get some herbs. And go quickly. Oh, no, you can't die! You mustn't! (groans) My son! (groans) (mumbles) (somber music) (men shouting) - Hya! (shouting) - Shih-Yu! - Ma! It's all right. I'm not going to die yet. (groans) - Come on. He's been so ill, unconscious for five days, and you didn't cry then. So why are you crying now? (mumbles) I'm just so happy to see him better. - Help me. I, uh- - Lie still. Don't try to move. Your body's still strapped up. But the main thing is you're getting better. So be a good patient. Lie down. - Yeah, I, oh, oh. - Hey, hey, hey! - I can move now, so get these damn bandages off. Help me! - I can't! It's too soon. You must stay like that for a while, to let the herbs soak through. - Take them off. Come on, you owe me a favor. - I know. That's why I came here. - Right, help me. - No, I won't. - You- (groaning) - Shih-Yu, you hurt? - Leave me. Get off, let go, get out! Get out! Go! - She won't go. This is her home now. - Ma! Why am I all wrapped up like this? My god, I'm just like a corpse! - Well, that's too bad, but that's how it is, and for another two weeks yet. - Ma, you can't! - Shiao Ping, help me. - Hey! Get off! (groaning) Hey, put me down! You, you can't do this! Leave me alone! Wait! Put me down, will you. What are you playing at? Put me down! Let, let go! Ma, let go! - Boo! (laughing) - You scared me. How do you feel now? - Oh, I'm all right now, just great! - Come on. You haven't got much balance. - I think I'm doing all right. - I don't think so. You practice some more. - Well, was that better? - Not bad, but you'll have to do a lot better than that. - For you. (laughing) - This place is pretty dull, you know. I get bored, so quiet. Ma, could I- - Yes? - Could I go to town? Ma, I'd like to go. - You can't. - Hey, what's that for? - Huh. you keep at it. - Huh. - Ma! What's all this, then? - Take this log, you think it hurts. Compared to a kick from Chien, it's nothing at all. And that's for sure. - I can get out of the way of Chien's kicks. - The first one, maybe, but not the second one. And even if you manage to get him, there's still his brother to reckon with. - Look, I- - Just practice. - Ma, this is a bit hard. Do you reckon you could do it? - If I could, your father would still be alive. (dramatic music) - I've had enough. - Shih-Yu! Stop him! - Shih-Yu! Now why are you acting like this? What's wrong with you? - Go home. Stop bothering me. - I realize this place is getting on your nerves. So then let's take a walk into town. - I don't have to practice? - No, I think you're getting tired. I think you need a change. - All right, come on. - Hey, hey, have you seen the state of your face, though? It's dirty. You'll have to wash it first. - Hey, hey, hey. - What is it? - Hey. - Hey, come on! Hey! (people chattering) - For you. - You're not eating? - I just want to watch you. - Hey, hey, what- (shouting) - Look, out there! Something seems to be happening. Hey, let's go out. - Uh, careful! Don't go out. Tan's men will still be looking out for you. Let's stay here. - Oh, I won't get into a fight. I'll just take a look. That's all. - Those are Tan's men there. Shih-Yu, you promised you wouldn't fight. - I can't just stand here, I- - You must. You promised me that you wouldn't fight. (all shouting) (punches thudding) - You mustn't get mixed up in that. Let's go back now. Come on. - No! - Ha ha, my men and me can do whatever we want to in this damn town. Is that perfectly clear now? - Yes, it is. So can we go now? - Sure, but not so quickly, because you're going to crawl out. Crawl. - You swine, you. - Well, are you going to do it, or not? (all shouting) (punches thudding) - Fang Shih-Yu! - Thanks for helping us. They would have killed us. They wouldn't have let us go. - Thank you. - Hold it! So it's you again. What do you want? - You're pretty cocky, but watch it. Now, you just go and tell your bosses, I'm alive, and I'm going to get them. - Huh! They'll break you into pieces. - Yeah? - We're going. - Yeah, we're going. - On your knees. Crawl! Or you'll die! (all shouting) (punches thudding) (crowd applauding) (crowd cheering) Crawl! - You wait till we get there. - Shut your mouth. - OK. (all shouting) (punches thudding) - Get going. - Fang Shih-Yu, I'm going to watch you die. - You won't live that long, unless you start to crawl. Crawl! (crowd laughing) - Shih-Yu! - Don't bother me. - Oh, please don't go! I don't want you to be killed. Listen, why don't you come home now? - Just shut up! - You're still too weak, though. - I practiced for a month. - Not enough, you know it isn't. Listen, for our sake come home with me now. I don't want to lose you. - Well, all right, are you coming? - Yeah, we'll rest here. - Yeah, OK. - Your brother? - He'll be here soon. He's on his way. - Hey, boss! Boss! Hey, boss! Boss! Hey, Boss! Fang Shih-Yu's on his way here. - Fang Shih-Yu? - Where is he? (people chattering) - Hey, boss! Boss! Boss! You gotta help us. - Don't go! - Hya! (men shouting) (punches thudding) (laughs) (men shouting) (punches thudding) (sobbing) (laughs) (groans) - Oh, well, if he's not dead, he's in a pretty bad way. We really gave it to him. (laughing) - That we did, he left half his skin on the hillside. (laughing) - And if his mother's got any sense, she'll just leave him to die this time. Otherwise, we may have to do the whole thing again. (laughing) - That's not very likely. I imagine he's lost his enthusiasm. (laughing) - Shih-Yu! Shih-Yu! Shih-Yu! Shih-Yu! Oh, no! - Shih-Yu, you've been in there for over two weeks now. You feeling any better? Hmm. - Listen, how much longer must I stay in here? - Till you're better. Now be patient. - Hey, listen! There's 49 of those dummies. When you can split the mud out of every single one of them, then you'll be ready to fight. (grunting) - Listen, don't you think he ought to rest? - Hya! - What's wrong? - Ma! Ma, you all right? - What's wrong? - Are you sick? - I'm all right. Carry on. - Listen, you lie down for a while. - I'll keep going. - Come on. I'll put you to bed. (grunting) - Ma! You all right? - Of course! I'll have a rest. Listen, don't forget your medicine, huh? - Tell me- - Hmm? - How long has it been since you had that big fight with them? Do you know? - Hmm, it's over a year. - In all those months, haven't you once had the urge to go out, and take revenge on those killers? - Well, I wanted to, but I was scared. Just one more time in that herb bath, and I'd be just like a lump of pickled pork. So then I reckoned I'd wait until I was ready, and fit. - I think that time has come now. - Hya! Hey! (laughing) Oh, yeah, hey, ma! That's great! Well, I'm going now. - Wait. You can't just kill them now, or they'll arrest you. - Well, how then? - Listen, I've got it. They'll be having a birthday soon. - Hey, come on now! It's our old friend's birthday today, so let's drink to him! (people chattering) - Hey, fill it up there, OK? - God damn it, so you didn't die. - All right. - Now listen, I don't want to break up this party, but I'll be available later, though. - Well, I don't want to fight now, either. I came here to give you an invitation. I want to take the three of you on in a public duel, and I'll take the three of you at once. - Oh! (laughing) - Well, will you? - Well, there's one thing that worries me, who's going to look after your poor, old mother? (laughing) - Do you accept it, then, yes or no? - Yes, they'll be there. And I shall be there to watch it, too. (dramatic music) - Here you are, a present for your birthday. - Oh, thank you. - Huh. This should be funny. They'll tear that fool to pieces. You can take him first, and I'll take over what's left. But don't forget to leave me something. (laughing) - Must be mad. I reckon that there isn't a man in the whole of the country who would stand a chance against the three of us. (people chattering) - Come on, move, move. (people chattering) - Look at that sign! Best in all Guangdong, Champions of all Suzhou. - Yeah, sure. - God damn it, I hope they get beaten. - Where's Fang Shih-Yu? - Yeah, where'd he go? - Where is he? It's late. (people chattering) - I challenge him, sir. (people chattering) (men shouting) (punches thudding) - Right, try me. (men shouting) (punches thudding) (groans) (people chattering) (groans) - Fang Shih- (dramatic music) - Ma, drink this now. - Son, you go now. You ought to be at the contest. - He can't. He's waiting till you're better. We want you to be there when he wins. Get some sleep now. - Be careful. They may come here looking for- - Fang Shih-Yu! Where are you? Come on out of there! - Listen! You mustn't fight with them here. If you do, and you kill them, they'll call it murder. Listen, stall them. Say what you like. Please, if only for my sake. - Right. I promise. No matter what they try on, I won't fight them. - You throw out all these big challenges, and then you hide at home. (laughing) - I won't fight with you here. My mother's pretty sick, and I'll wait until she's better. - Oh, what a considerate son you are. But what if she never gets better? After all, we can't postpone this thing indefinitely. - Don't worry about that. Whatever happens, I'll meet you in three days time. - Oh, you want to put it off, right? Hmm. Well, I could oblige you, providing you crawl and- (dramatic music) (laughing) (crying) (men shouting) (punches thudding) (people chattering) (men shouting) (punches thudding) (people chattering) - Fang Shih-Yu! (people chattering) - Listen, those guys have killed our kin. - Yeah, those bastards. You've got to get them. (people chattering) - Get him, Fang! (people chattering) (dramatic music) (men shouting) (punches thudding) (crowd applauding) (crowd cheering) (people chattering) (men shouting) (punches thudding) - Get him! (people chattering) - Stay here. He can handle this. (men shouting) (punches thudding) - Shih-Yu! Shih-Yu! - My god. - Shih-Yu! (intense music) - Hey! - Shih-Yu! (building crashes) (dramatic music)
