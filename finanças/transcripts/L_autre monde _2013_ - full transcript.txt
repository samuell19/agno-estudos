One cannot penetrate the labyrinth by moving in a straight line. THE OTHERWORLD Here, in the south of France, exists a web of concentrated telluric energies. A portal in Montségur, Rennes-m-Chéteau and Bugarach. Together they form a gateway to the otherworld. Seven centuries ago, crusaders perpetuated a genocide against the Occitan countries and the Cathar faith. In 1244, they besieged Montségur where 210 martyrs condemned by the Church of Rome died at the stake. But their faith and occult science didn't die with them. MONTSEGUR - SUMMER SOLSTICE - 2012 AD URANIE - sorcerer It's that time of the year when there's a sort of portal... A gate that might open onto a spiritual world. And which allows some people who so desire to accomplish a transmutation. It's alchemical. And it's part of a system that was adopted by the Cathars and the Templars from ancient prehistoric and megalithic sites designed to capture and channel the different telluric and cosmic energies. And here in Montségur, the castle is built according to a certain geometric shape according to siderial geography... It's a sort of... How can I put this? Sort of testament they left behind. It's a tradition that goes way back in time. And that's the Cathar heritage. The Cathar Grail that was described by Otto Rahn: is the geometric form of the castle, the way it's built, the way you make your way around it... It's the geometric symbolism of the star system, the pentagram: incarnation of the flesh the hexagram: the union of heaven and earth... It's very symbolic and at the same time, it's like radionics. Waves that form shapes. The connection has been established by people who supposedly had access to the spiritual dimension and whose mission it was to transmit that knowledge over time. And speaking of those portals or gates, they're still very much active. Science and all that... That's for trying to understand how all this works, so as to gain access to other worlds, you see? It's a place where obviously, things happen to people who come in search of something, like all the ones present here tonight... There was a time about twenty years ago when a lot more people were present here for the solstices. There were Occitans, nazis, hippies... There were Krishnas, and even inquisitors recognizable from their Dominican clothing present hereto see what was going on... They were intrigued, they were wondering what so many people were doing at Montségur, freezing their butt off just to look at a ray of sunlight. There are stories about solar temples because this ray of light was discovered but what was it really? It was just a calendar because the people who lived here, they were peasants and they needed to know when the solstices ended so they could plant their seeds and things. There's nothing weird about it, it's a sort of clock. Everybody's going nuts over this orange ray of light... Yeah, it's a phenomenon but that's not the point. This is a high place since prehistoric times. Every man looks to the heavens in search of God. You only have to look at the starry landscape above. People have always gathered here because it's a high point, it's a place full of energy and submitted to telluric forces and that's it. There's every chance of meeting outsiders here whose vision and way of thinking is similar to that of the inhabitants of Montségur. We're here to see the sunrise tomorrow morning and everything has been thought out, everyone will see it... The sun aligns, it lights up... The ultimate goal is to release our souls trapped in our material bodies living in this world of Satan and ascend towards the kingdom of our Father of which we were born. An old Cathar prophecy announces that after a period of 700 years, the laurel will turn green again and the old ways return. When we come to Montségur today, in the 21st century, we're struck by the magic of this place. FABRICE CHAMBON - archeologist - There's the landscape, and this mountain dominating the forests facing the Pyrénées and where sometimes birds of prey fly over. The feeling here is that of being out of time. RICHARD PIGELET - curator - The mountain of Montségur is a very particular place. Whichever side you observe it from, you see this emerging peak and you feel a strong magnetic pull. Just from looking at it, you can feel this strong natural magnetism coming off of Montségur. There's the history of this region, the tragedy that took place Much can be said about the treasure or the stake... But you never leave this place as you came. To a lot of people, Montségur is a solar temple. To others, it was a temple of worship to the Cathars. And others still, by touching the stones of the castle, try to communicate with the memory of the rocks. Some, in a more mundane way, come to Montségur to meditate. And a lot has been said about Montségur Some even said it had a relation with extraterrestrials. This place is a site of pilgrimage that attracts more and more people, I think it's because they wonder about Catharism and its still remaining mysteries. It's on a spiritual level. I think they're looking for understanding. Montségur is a place of initiation. to their past, to their future and to their present. They identify with the history of the Cathars, a history worthy of a novel or a movie. You get the feeling that everything was predestined. You can feel people searching for something inside themselves, as if this place called for instrospection of the self. The height of the mountain symbolizes the union of heaven and earth. As in all civilizations, it's the dwelling place of the gods. It's where man rises up, where he has the possibility to rise toward God. As you can see, this place is no simple castle. It's not just an historical site. We're in a place that holds a lot of depth and importance to many people. AIMEE COUQUET - inhabitant of Montségur Many people hold magical rituals up there. Sects still come here to practice magical rites. SCARLETT AMARIS - author & esoteric researcher We know that the Cathars - and this is very innovative - did not discriminate between women and men. There's a woman from here who's very famous, she was the sister of the Count of Foix and her name was Esclarmonde Ever since she was a child, she was surrounded by poets, troubadours and musicians so she was very gifted, very intelligent. When the troubadours sang about Esclarmonde, they praised the beauty of this woman but not just her physical beauty, her inner beauty as well. She allowed the fortification of Montségur so as to be able to receive the Cathars fleeing from the Inquisition at the time. When the Northern Crusaders arrived in Languedoc, arms in hand, they were very surprised by the freedom women had here. They were astonished to see women commanding men. Countesses of Comminges commandeering their troops. There were women, as in Montségur, who took up arms. They were like Occitan Joan of Arcs. Esclarmonde died in 1240 and didn't witness the fall of Montségur. What's interesting about Catharism is the great role played by women. One might say that without the Cathar women, catharism wouldn't have scared the Roman church so much. One might extrapolate even further. Maybe the crusades never would've existed. It was the women who really shook the Roman church in its beliefs. Beyond that, it's interesting to note that when prehistoric people depicted human beings, they were always women. The most beautiful examples of ancient findings were discovered by archaeologists deep in the caves of the Pyrenees and they're called “Mother Goddesses”. They're small statuettes and form the first known traces of art created by humanity. Today, even in novels, when Cathar women and Esclarmonde are mentioned, it's obviously a direct reference to the worship of womanhood that still exists in the Pyrénées today. Like I said, the castle of Montségur is the grail itself. It holds the keys to the architecture and the network in place since prehistoric times. THE DEVIL'S CHAIR - RENNES-LES-BAINS We don't know why there's a pentacle, why there's a hexagram... In fact, nobody really knows. Those are astronomical markers for certain periods of time... that coincide with... the places built on telluric and cosmic landmarks. THE CIRCLES SPRING It's the heritage. In that sense, it is the grail. The Grail isn't hidden somewhere. It's not about blowing up Montségur in order to find it. The grail is the castle itself. So, if you have some time on your hands and you don't know what to do, you can take a map and trace lines accordingly and see what turns up. So, Hook a map of the surroundings and the castle... And I thought to myself, if there's something to be found, it must be accessible for everyone, more or less, by easy means. Not everybody's a freemason of the 33rd degree and carries knowledge of all the arcana of sacred geometry. And my first thought was Rennes-le-Chéteau, Rennes-les-Bains. So I said to myself that I'd trace a circle, just out of curiosity... I took the church of Rennes-le-Chéteau and put my compass here, hop, The church of Rennes-les-Bains, toc We try to make it somewhat precise, since we're going at it... And I traced the circle, simply enough. This is when I realized that the circle... was connecting with Campagne-les-Bains to the ancient Templar fortress and the church... I traced the line and... The first evident line that stuck out was the radius connecting Rennes-le-Chéteau / Rennes-les-Bains And so I traced... And I thought to myself, well, these things have stumbled upon themselves nicely. I then pursued from Rennes-les-Bains, hop... and kept the same radius... Without changing it... And I then traced what they call the Vesica Pisces shape in the construction lingo. And now, we trace from Rennes-les-Bains... And I realized that churches of Rennes-les-Bains and Bézu. Were connected on the same radius. Well, hum, a whole new coincidence... Four churches that connect just by making one tracing like that... Which made in turn, a composite of two hexagrams... with a slight offset, which allowed me to draw a twelve-branch star. Drawing this shape led me to discover other points and little by little, that's how it developed. And I realized that in relation to my place... URANIE'S PROPERTY ...on my property, there are landmarks relating to the phases of the solstice and the equinox... So, I had my three axis seen from here which were already included in a figure because... That's sort of the shrewdness... If you begin this personal research because that's what it is... Nobody else can make it for you... Tracing... You have to do it on your own... to see. Already, when we trace, we find things we can't explain! And we realize that these shapes are alive. They're active. They act on the spirit. There's always a moment when something will happen, that'll lead you to discover a new figure made by mistake. And I've made lots of mistakes. And found lots of things by making errors in my angles... I would be tracing one figure and end up drawing another! So yeah, some things happen on their own because this site remains active. RENNES-LE-CHATEAU - SUMMER 2012 (Latin) This place is to be feared, this is the house of God and the Gate to Heaven. CHURCH OF THE HOLY MARY-MAGDALENE The church is dedicated to Mary Magdalene who is another manifestation of the Goddess. The first ray of sun on the 17th of January illuminates the edifice. In the nineteenth century, Abbé Bérenger Saunière allegedly uncovered a fabulous treasure that made him immensely wealthy. He built this place following an occult concept and took the secret to his grave. This mystery fed a prosperous commercial industry ranging from "The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail" to the "DaVinci Code". ALAIN X - Stone Mason -'Rennes-le-Chéteau is a place... that can be as beneficial as negative. ALEX PAINCO - Mayor of Rennes-le-Chateau -Rennes-le-Chéteau is an old village, an historical village and it has changed a lot since the arrival of Abbé Saunière in 1885. Abbé Saunière has built a lot of edifices here and that's where the mystery of Rennes-le-Chéteau springs from. Rennes-le-Chateau is a place of initiation. Not everybody can just go into this. The elders knew that Hell had seven gates. Each one has a guardian worse than the other. It's only by passing through these gates that we can escape the hell of the material world. Or bring heaven down to earth. ARTUR SALA - physicist And the horror movies? The Fulci films? The Italian horror films? Yeah. That's what opened the door for me. The gates of Hell? Yes. Rennes-le-Chéteau is... It's special... It's a place where you can either lose your soul or rise. It's... it's a labyrinth like the ones that exist in old cathedrals, built by our ancestors... With hidden pits and traps... We get a lot of tourists here, about 120,000 each year. For such a small village with eighteen year-round inhabitants, ten shops is a lot. So we can say tourism is what makes Rennes-le-Chéteau live. Rennes-le-Chéteau is like a spiderweb with a spider in the middle. It's gigantic but invisible at the same time. And the people who come here should know that they're like flies. If they get caught in the web, well... They get eaten. Thanks to Abbé Saunière, the mystery lives on. Researchers come here, several movies have been made about this place... ...Numerous books have been written, about 600 until now. Rennes-le-Chéteau has become internationally known, since Abbé Saunière came here. When you set out in your path of initiation, when you travel around France... ...It's up to you not to stumble and keep walking on the right path to become what is known as a "companion". If you're not capable of being a companion, if you can't get rid of... If y0u're just bait and y0u're incapable of seeing the apprentice side of things, You can't be a companion. You're not part of the companionship in Rennes-le-Chéteau, it's as simple as that. For the people to understand. It comes from ancient times, it's from a lost world of gates and... For the people to understand. I mean... For the people who come here, the ones seeking something, it's up to them not to get lost. That's all I have to say. If some people lose themselves here in Rennes-le-Chéteau, others come to seek answers. That was the case of François Mitterrand who came here a few days before the election on a very mysterious visit. As for Mitterand's visit to Rennes-le-Chéteau, ANDRE GALLAUD - Journalist -it didn't go exactly the way it's described in the books or the movies made about it. It happened during the presidential campaign that took place in the month of May, 1981. Mitterrand was asked to come to Couiza to present himself to the people here. As tradition has it, a great dinner was held at the village hall. After the dinner was over, president Robert Capdeville turns to Mitterrand and asks him if all is well and Mitterand responds in form... Capdeville then says “Listen, if it's all right with you and in order to properly digest this excellent meal, I would like to show you a site that you’ll remember. Instead of your usual walk, I'll take you up to Rennes-le-Chéteau... So they went up to Rennes-le-Chéteau, They were welcomed by the departmental councilor and the mayor. Mitterrand then discovered this site and was amazed by the view and What the Abbé had built, but there was never any question about a treasure or anything like that. After walking around a bit, Mitterrand wanted to see the Magdala Tower. So we came up here and he climbed to the top of the Tower and he was... He was completely in awe with the view. That was that. That was the way Mitterrand's visit to the department of Aude, Couiza and Rennes-le-Chéteau went. It all happened very simply, it was mostly a digestive walk. As history has it, something happened here a few years back. The mirror downstairs is not the original one. What happened was that several youngsters came up here, one of which was the owner's daughter. They looked into the mirror and saw the Devil. They were scared out of their wits. And they ended up at my place. The only time they ever came here...! They told me they'd seen the Devil in the mirror. And it reminded me of what one of the early researchers told me, a guy named Jean Pelé. He said he knew about formulas to call up the Devil in mirrors. He had taught this formula to certain people and now regretted it because they'd abused it. And what probably happened back then, I think that the people who lived here... ...used those formulas and opened a gate, toc, through the mirror... and saw the Devil. But they weren't prepared for it. And I'm the one who broke that mirror when I came here in the early nineties... ...to do a sort of purification... Because it was so loaded that something had to be done. And this mirror had an importance in history. I don't really know the bottom of the story, what happened then... But point being, I broke it! And so I closed the door for this devil. When you dine with the Devil, you better have a big spoon otherwise... you don't eat. And since this place is a sort of spider web, you know, it's like a spider... This is sort of the center where impulses are received from various places... URANIE'S HOUSE ...from as far away as England or maybe even further... ...it's the whole network that's used... And over the course of history in Rennes-le-Chéteau and the area of La Coume... URANIE'S CAT I can say that there have been lots of assaults... ...a lot of things done to destroy... this place, the community and the people who live here. I've made all this over time and it's... Well, there's no artistic purpose in exhibiting works with a "vision"...! The ultimate goal is to balance the energies so all this has been made little by little, during certain periods, moments, certain phases... ...over time. It has a therapeutic purpose. Magico-therapy. To balance energies and avoid taking too much in. They're like shields. URANIE'S NEIGHBOR - corporate CEO Jaap Rameijer JAAP'S HOUSE JAAP'S CAT JAAP'S VIDEO - LES LABADOUS - SUMMER 2012 It's... To really understand Rennes-le-Chéteau one must come here, look around... And then one must check out a map. If you have Rennes-les-Bains here... Rennes-le-Chéteau there... And draw the equilateral triangle... Then you only have to look out the window and see what there is. If you look hard enough, you can see a farm called Le Carla. If we divide this in half... And take the bisector... Le Carla is at this precise spot. It's a very particular geometric shape If you look at the bottom of those rocks... Just at the edge of the field, there's a tiny red spot. All that's needed is a little bit of phonetic Cabala to make an anagram of Carla So, toc, what does Sauniere show us? The Grail. It's a nice gift, isn't it? And then I discovered... ...that a shape appears here... ...of a woman's head... ...right in the axis of the rising sun and leading straight to Le Carla. Le Carla can be seen from the Magdala Tower. Let's see what Saunière might have wanted to tell us if it had any such intentions... It's the alignment of this ramp knob with the middle of the window, the church window that has been placed here... And if we align the two... We end up on the cave of Mary Magdalene. It used to be the Fournet Cave but it has been renamed to Mary Magdalene. I think it used to be an ancient celtic or druidic site, where certain initiations or rituals took place... There's all this symbolism of fecundity, death and rebirth related to caves. And we can see on the church's altar a painting of Mary Magdalene in the cave... It's always been a place where groups of people come to do rituals... It's always active. There seems to be a certain specificity to this place in that it has this sort of incubating role... in the practices of certain occult groups surrounding the culture of succubi and incubi and other spirits... These people are trying to get women to copulate with the incubi in order to give birth to fantastical creatures. Legend has it that Mérovée, the first Merovingian king, was the son of a witch and a succubus. Just like Merlin the enchanter. So there's a persistent underlying base in Rennes-le-Chéteau where there's a lot of ceremonials and sexual rituals that are carried out in order to incarnate spirits that are believed to be superior. I hope the village will stay as it is, pretty and peaceful, and keep attracting tourists, but normal ones. I've had a lot of administrative problems such as obtaining a building permit... ...of conformity... Right now, I'm living here as an outlaw since my house isn't in accordance with sanitary regulations. Three years ago, we surprised several people digging beneath the cemetary. They were caught in time. I receive mail from people telling me that Jesus is no longer buried here, but is buried in Bayonne. People who believe that the body of Jesus is in the church or that they've uncovered the treasure... -- people who believe that Mary Magdalene is buried beneath the village --... It took me twelve years, twelve years and three internments... ...to get the whole property back. Plus the problems... The worries... Everything you can imagine... ...all the things that happen when the powers that be have decided to destroy your life. Things like isolation... Total isolation, separation from friends and family... No more means, no car, nothing... Loss of income, the maximum in other words. We've also had Jesus himself stop by at the mayor's office, some guy claiming to be Jesus. It's fabulous. I filed a complaint... They said I was right. And then they measured up the terrain and to tell me I was right, they went toc, and reclaimed some of it! So, yeah. It's that type of administrative harassment... But we can't say they did it on purpose. I don't know. We can say it's a mistake, at least, that's what they told me after twelve years. “We're sorry, we made a mistake”. They still confined me three times to a mental hospital with chemical treatment. That's not nothing. It's not an easy situation. I still have treatments with a psychiatrist. It's three months in a hospital. And then it's three months of therapy... ...and injections of psychotropic substances. In my case it was Aldol. Generally, I just turn them back nicely by saying that Rennes-le-Chateau wants to remain a peaceful place... So that these types of people can just go away and not stay here. Then there were the direct threats on my life, death threats. Obvious ones. And several misguided attempts to eliminate me. Physically. There are quite a few people who are a little “special”, one might say.. But they're mostly in Bugarach To me, Rennes-le-Chéteau was the precursor to the Bugarach phenomenon. BUGARACH - SUMMER 2012 JEAN-PIERRE DELORD - mayor of Bugarach - We're all a little weird... People come here with their own beliefs... This is a democracy where people are free to think and believe as they want. I have no problem with people coming here on a pilgrimage or searching for something else. My problem is if having too many of them here at once. 36 years as the mayor. It's a job like any other. It's like being the chief tribesman. But it's okay. Two hundred people to care for... A superb countryside and... that! Fantastic! That mountain is particular. We can already see it by its shape and placement. It's particular because geologically speaking, all the layers are reversed. If you consult a compass... there's a definite discrepancy. There must be a very large mass of iron underneath. I tell everybody to "Get up there and you'll see, you’ll come down different”. Some never get fully back down, they stay perched up there! The truth is that when I heard about this event, I notified the prefectoral authorities so they'd take an interest in the phenomena. In turn, they notified MIVILUDES, the government department that monitors cult activity and which have investigated the three regional divisions around here. They indeed thought there was something going on and following that discovery, the prefect decided to put this place under surveillance. Maybe they'll call in the military. There's always that possibility. JEROME VIGUIER - mountain guide - The mayor's office and the mayor in particular is very down to earth. So he's probably afraid that people are going to climb the mountain of Bugarach and throw themselves into a vortex or portal. When the month of December is over, they'll just find another date to hold on to. They'll all look like idiots. That's what I believe. It's all bogus stuff. It's a complete delirium. I still have my feet firmly planted on the ground, I'm not gone yet! If I'd wanted to set all this up myself... Already, with an advertising agency, it would've cost me a fortune. It probably wouldn't have had the same impact. I'm completely baffled... by the proportions this fad has taken. Of course, these stories about the end of the world periodically resurface. We humans are haunted by the demise of our planet. I think the real problem lies therein. One night, it must've been around 2 a.m. I was spending the night in a cave with friends... Just near its entrance. And around 2 a.m., I woke up for no reason. And I saw this huge white light outside. It filled up the whole entrance to the cave which must've been... 30-50 feet wide. I didn't have the presence of mind to get up and check it out. The next morning, I talked it over with my friends and one of them said he'd seen the same thing. Like me, he didn't get up to see what was going on but... A great white light... On a moonless night. We were far from the road so it couldn't have been car lights. The mystery remains. The story stems from a character who lived - he's passed on, now - he lived near the "Source Salée" domain on the edge of the village... He claimed to hear humming coming from a cave and believed the sound was coming from an underground garage where they repaired flying saucers, etc... The myth started from this. It got in print in UFO magazines and then the story came back on the internet, etc, etc. A trekker took this picture in Montferrier in 1976... It shows a flying saucer that supposedly appeared in the sky one morning. The picture has never been authenticated by professionals so nobody knows whether it's fake or not. The person whose idea it was to print a postcard representing a flying saucer is a photographer who lives one village over. He sold it to us. There's another postcard with a small blue-green creature next to the peak who's obviously an extraterrestrial. Some people firmly believe that Montségur is an extraterrestrial landing base. There was this group who came in with all sorts of electronic equipment and who set up antennaes all over the mountain. So l went up to them to ask what was going on... They told me they were communicating with extraterrestrials who were living inside the mountain. I have a lot of friends who are very much in touch with Nature... They see faeries, gnomes and goblins in Bugarach. All sorts of phenomena. You pass through a gate where you see all things material such as houses, standing stones, dolmens, trees, hills, mountains, earth... That's what you see. And then, there's another gate where you hear voices, sounds of horses, but you can't communicate with them. It's as if they don't see you at all. All the places like that, like in Montségur, are doors. There are certain periods of the year when those energies are more active than at others... It's a sort of... it's a celestial gate... and at the same time infernal. Because it's also a gateway to Hell. If you invoke the Devil here, no problem, he'll show up and ask you what you want. In general, when passing through a gate, there's a mix of the past, the present and the future. Let's say that, a few years back, I had an intense experience about Montségur. I came across a book about the Cathars which I'd never heard about before. When I looked at the cover picture of Montségur, I had a revelation. I think I may have lived a previous life here. The first time I went to Montségur, I remembered who I was... I don't know... They say that before you die, all the important things in your life flash before your eyes... I experienced that but the other way around. In fact... I was Arpaïx de Péreille, one of Raymond de Péreille's daughters. He was co-lord of Montségur. My role was very important. But I didn't end up at the stake with the others. We ran off... in the direction of the mountains. And we were arrested there by our own men. I don't know the reason why. It was very hard for me because I ran away with my husband and he had our child in his arms. It was a little boy but I don't know exactly how old he was. And we were separated at that point. I spent the rest of my life in a prison in Carcassonne. This is a place I need to return to regularly to renew myself. I feel at home here. Not so long ago, about three or fours years back, I realized that I'd lived several past lives. During an akashic lecture, it was explained to me that I'd lived a very important one in the Middle Ages and it had made a mark on me. Which explains the problems of my present life. So I delved into this... ...and I realized that everybody has had several lives filled with different experiences - good and bad - and that one needs to find a balance between the two in order to become an accomplished soul and no longer have the need to reincarnate. Maybe that's the reason I chose medieval names for my children. I didn't yet know about this past life, I didn't feel anything towards reincarnation. I didn't even understand it. The names I'd chosen for my children were Aliénor, Margaux, Childéric and Alaric and I know now that it was no coincidence. I've always been attracted to the Middle Ages. So evidently, there's a problem with those who mistake their desires for reality or their dreams for reality. Still, it's kind of amusing that during the course of one year, four different Raymond de Péreilles stop by the museum of Montségur to introduce themselves... If all the people pretending to have been reincarnated were accounted for, I think the number of Cathars burned at the stake would greatly supersede 225. The number would be closer to the thousands. I think we're all destined to find each other. I've met people in Lavalanet or in other places who've had the same experience as me. - Even on Facebook - So it's more or less of a coincidence... JAAP'S VISION OF THE MAGDALENE I put this clock here to be sure of what time it is... Because we're not in the real time. If you check your watch, it's probably around 2 p.m., maybe a little more? A little later, 2230 p.m.? And in fact, there's a two hour gap here so we live on fake time. So here's our famous pentagram. You just have to open your heart and soul. The key is the heart. That's where the grail is. Since our souls are locked in this world of flesh it is our destiny to rise and return to the Father of all good souls. That's it. Have a nice journey home...
