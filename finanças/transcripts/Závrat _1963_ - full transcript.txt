VERTIGO - Lock the door or you'll fall out. - Why would I fall out? - You haven't been running all over again, have you? - No. Here. - Did you get your report card yet? - Yeah. And you haven't failed, have you? Can't you herd them on the meadow? Hi bumblebee! - Look, a horse. - Duh. And how he shone his shoes! - Hello Božena. - Hello. Do you ever have any duties? Daddy! How many B's? Pour us quick before the train leaves. Penicillin. - Someone's sqeamish! - You'll be in Teplice, send this. Three times three hundred for child support. This will put you on a diet. Forget about smoking, too. Dear friend, indulgence always comes at a price. Pour me too. - Have a beer instead. - Give him three packs of cigs. You'll see, he'll end up just the same. No way, Gába has a method, always scrams in time! He can wish. You only mess up your life once. It's touch-me-not now, not so at night! - Put it on my tab. - Leavin' in the afternoon? It's the end of the week. I'll be back for the card game. Don't inconvenience yourself. Let's not play today. - Working again tonight? - Only number six will be on. - Hello. - Sir. Božena dear, could you do something for me? Got it. The shirt. Božena! Well? - Are you going to the movies Sunday? - I don't know yet. Maybe. - Then I'll buy you a ticket. - Not yet. Only if I end up going. - Bye. - Bye. Hey! Božena! Turn on the water, pronto! Daddy! - Why did you turn off the water? - I was here all the time. - Isn't it true, Mr. Engineer? - Sure. I've ironed the shirt. Daddy, I'm going out to read. Still nothing? They'll kick us out after all. Well, who knows if there's any tin at all. Yes, there is. All of Moldava is on tin. But it is very deep. So deep they won't wait any longer. - It already cost a fortune. - It costs me too. I'm not young enough to wait for another such place. Don't take up this job. Choose something more perspective. For the kidneys, to cheer up! One more, Božena dear. Come on. Turn it off! Damnit, where is he? Are you asleep? - Yes. - Open. - Why? - Do you know where Gába went? - I wouldn't know. - It's very important. We have a broken diesel. You know his routine. C'mon! - I'll go get him. You don't need to go. We only asked where he is. - I'll go myself. - Wanna get spanked?! Good night. Martin, she's not little anymore. - What do you need? - Good evening. - I'm looking for comrade Gabriel. - Who? Comrade Gabriel. There's no comrade Gabriel. - And anyway, who do you think you are? - Listen, tell him he's urgently needed. Mr. Engineer sends for him. Otherwise, I'm not leaving and I'll keep ringing the doorbell. Help! I don't know what I'll do to you, dummy. - Stupid dummy. - No one here is a dummy. - No, I'll even end up thanking you, brat! - No one here is a brat. Mr. Engineer wants you to fix the diesel. He can go fix it himself. Now what? You aware I'm gonna spank you? Like you've never been before. And like I should've a long time ago. Not only did you break it, you had to start fixing it as well. With a hammer! I'm sick of this overtime! Never heard of the poetry of labour? Hand me a spanner nineteen and a screwdriver. You think it's all nonsense here? No, I know that. Still, I may have some sympathy for genuine zeal left. But that's not the case for you. Why don't you go to bed? I'm going. I brought food. Breakfast! Hurray! - How much? - About thirty. I'm off for diesel. Take some bread. I'm not hungry. That mumbling one called again. She said she'd call back. What shall I tell her? - You better tell me what you told her! What would've I been telling her? I don't care for your grannies. She said she was baking strudel. Buddy, watch out this strudel doesn't end up too dear! - Is that strudel? - You can tell? - Will you work for Tatra again after your service? Yes, they wrote they still want me. - How much do they pay? - 1,500 or so. Depends. Go, they're waiting. I'm not gonna beg. - How's it going? - She's baking me strudel. Nice! Let's try two more feet. Well, how does it look? I believe we can break through. It worked out in Slovakia after all. I've… Gába, what was it like? Moldava 5, who's calling? No, he's not home. Where'd he be? He's out. Anything to note down? What's the number? Extension 108, alright. - Who was that? - No one, actually. What's the matter? Idiots, there's tin! Turn it off! You've had enough, Mr. Engineer. But I finally can, Božena dear. Everything turned out fine. Now I can even retire. I wish I had a daughter like that. You have no idea how lucky you are. Only troubles. Poor thing could do with a mother. Why are you crying? Just tell me if you want a daughter. I have three of them. - Yes, my friend, but where's all that gone? - Down the drain! You roar like an elephant! Gába! Harem calling, the pasha's missing! I'm not here. Moldava 5 He left. No. I don't know. Can you dance to that? Who was it? Božena, in an apron? I'll go get changed. No ironing. Really, I will not iron! - Are you looking for someone? - No. Put the beer down. Daddy! You should've left our women alone, bastard! So that you don't forget! Watch out! Daddy, help! Water. They're gone? Yes, but I remember their license plate. - Damnit, could you be a little gentle? - No! Don't tell anyone, okay? No need to. It's all broken, even daddy's table hockey. Don't answer. Don't touch it! Moldava 5 Yes, bring beer too. Monday. Goodbye. Goal. Oh my God! I'll maim that idiot. Scoot upstairs! - Hey. - Good afternoon. Three hundred for bed and board. - Five hundred for the broken stuff. - How much? - How much for that junk? - Five hundred. Just pay and get out. - Where to? - Wherever. To the chicks for all I care. Give me a beer. Not to a scoundrel. Out! - Daddy… - What are you doing here? - The stupid records he brought you will go too. - No! - Cheers, Gába! - Hi! How's it going? - Where are you moving? - I'm leaving in the morning. I'll manage without your Moldava. And where shall we get a fourth to play cards? You can't throw him out. Why not. I'll even kick his butt. You can't just throw people out. Pub's a public place. - Meh, you just keep eating. - Pour me a beer. I should have put an end to his affairs a long time ago. He did not want to fight, you know. - What? - He did not want to, they started it. I'll smack you too, always taking his calls. If only she were in Prague already. - Yes? - It's me. - What did I tell you? - She has more reason than you. Hand over that 800. 700. That's all I have. The rest after payday. - Well, goodbye Christmas tree for the kids. - Oh, come on! Okay, it can wait. Božena. Božena! Hey! Lay off the stupid jokes! What jokes? Don't play dumb! Or else I'll get up there and...! Yeah? But who's gonna lift you up? Or do you have a helicopter? - Don't provoke me! - Take it easy, you haven't recovered yet. Who wants to climb up there? You, with that arm? Now you've asked for it. I'd climb up there blindfolded. At midnight. Here's a fifty note, hotshot. I'll put flowers on your grave. Cut it out, it's not worth it! Take off your shoes. I'm serious, get down! We were only joking. Oh, brother. I'll fix the bandage. That's Germany over there. Why do you come here? To have a look? Is it worth the climb? How's it going? You dizzy? Well, almost. The descent's more difficult. There used to be ladders, but they were removed. - I'll go first, I'll show you how. - Wait. You know you are… you have... Gába! What? Listen, if you ruin that girl's life... …I'm done with you. You have no concept of fun. Hello, Daddy. What's wrong? Let me. - What'll I get for fixing it? - How was your tour? - What? - Well, yesterday. Boring. Really? - Twenty. - Very good. Here's the ten. Oh, the general himself. - Good evening - Oh, you're still alive? - I'd have a beer. - Take it from the counter. - I'm off to bed. - But who will play? The soldier. Good night. - Do you play whist? - Well... - Not well. - Sit down. Božena, I want to tell you something. I had to come. What position am I on your list? You're a good kisser. Natural gift. You've been with someone? - Have you? - Where's daddy? Downstairs. - He always comes before bedtime. - They're playing cards. Maybe he's not coming. Wait, I'll have a look. Božena. Quiet! Božena. What are you doing here? Walking. Give me some coffee. Didn't Božena bring you some? Daddy, I'm going. May I tell them the party's here? Just remember to clean up afterwards. Gába! Hop in, I'll take you to station. No need. I've plenty of time. Why did you lock the door? I always lock it. You kiddin' me? I do my best. - It wasn't funny for me. - I know, you could've fallen off the roof. Božena! Draw already! Focus on the game. For you, right? Yes, speaking. I can't do it, really. I know, but... No. I said no. Daddy, I'm off to bed. Good night. - Colour. - Good. - Red. I'm off. Good night. Wait, I'm going too. Dammit! What's wrong with you? Hey, can you play this? Good night. Listen, I don't need a watchdog. - I've just about had it. - Why so uptight? Gába, we have to send a truck to Chomutov for a week. Wanna go? - Why me? Do I have to? - No, not necessarily. Anyone of you three will do. Engineer! - I'll take it. When do I leave? - In the morning. Why so soon today? - Moving. Is there a place left? - Yep. - But only until Thursday. - I'll be back in Moldava by then. - Hi Gába! You're back. - Hello. - Cheers! - Good evening. - Are you hungry? - No. - Are you sure? You see. Better than Congo. Tin's everywhere you step. - Looks like there's lithium too. - Excellently. - Good evening. - Hi. Now solo for Božena! Woohoo! Do you have a torch. I can't find mine. - Where are you going? - Number 3. - Hold on, I'll drive you there. - Get some sleep. Come on. - What's new? - Tin aplenty. - And what about Božena? - Leave her alone. Have you joined the missionaries? Am I mangy or what? Not that. You just easily get fed up with them. Come on. Should I have just played cards all the time? Waste time in some dump? Am I a slacker or what? So why the reproach? Oh, come on. She's just not a girl for guys like us. - Don't put her on a pedestal. - I don't. But don't you try to make a... Get out! Are you deaf? Scram! Scram or I'll do you in. Get in. Get in! I brought you a cake. With chocolate. Are you kidding me? You baked it yourself? Go. Go. Do you hear me? I... Good night. - Where is everybody? - Who? - Martin, Pernikl? - They went to see the girl off. - Where's she going? - Božena's moving to Prague. To study or something. Didn't you know that?
