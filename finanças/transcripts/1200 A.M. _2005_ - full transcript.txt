12:00 AM Good morning, Inez. It's you, Amel. You surprised me. Come on. Honey, where are you going? I'm going with Bayu. Why? I told you, I'm going to take photos. So that's it then? It's your camera over me? Why do you talk like that? You've known me since the beginning, haven't you? Fine. But tonight's plan is still on, isn't it? -What's that? -Dinner! Of course it's still on. -Okay, I'll leave, then. -Okay. Be careful. Okay. I'll definitely have dinner with you. Honey, what's the purpose of this? -It has this thing on it. -That's crazy. Hey! You really surprised me! Alvin! What the hell? -Are we leaving now? -Let's go. -Come on, then. -Honey, be careful. I'm slipping! -Bye! -Bye! I love you. Alvin, your job is to take good care of my boyfriend. It's rare to find a male like him. What is he? A rhinoceros? -Damn it. -Damn you! -Okay, then. Bye. -Bye. What is it? I'm at the studio. I've been waiting for you for a long time in the restaurant. Damn. I forgot. Okay, I'm going there right now. This is infuriating! He's very late. Maybe he's still on his way. Would you like me to call him? No. Don't bother. He's always like that. Whenever he's in his studio... ...he'd forget about time. Don't be so tense, Inez. Besides, it's not like we need to discuss an urgent matter... ...is it? Calm down. Let's just relax. That doesn't mean he can arrive very late like this. He promised to arrive on time. Well, have it your way. -Bayu! -Hi, Alvin. A moment, please. I'm staying out of this. Honey. What's with you? I'm angry. You don't have to act so extreme. -You've changed. -How have I changed? How have you changed? Something needs to change in our relationship. Alvin, how much longer do I have to be patient? How much longer? Okay. I was wrong. I apologize. Okay? -Alvin, come close! -The point is, we need to be unified. Especially both you. Stop quarreling. That's not true! We're solid, aren't we? We need to be united at heart, feelings, and nation. For independence! You're dropping by, aren't you? Dropping by? I don't think so, Honey. I have a lot of work to do. I'll come tomorrow. I promise. I'm sorry. Fine. -Thank you. -Okay. Are you sure you won't drop by? Yes. Okay. Hello? Yes, Mother. What? It's okay if you can't return this week. How's Grandmother? You don't have to worry about me. I'm okay. Yes. Okay. Please, be careful, Mom. Be mindful of your health. Bye. Hey, Alvin. Damn, I had a bad night. What happened? I think I hit something with my car last night. What did you hit? I think it's a person. But when I try to find that person, he's already gone. Alvin. Maybe it has something to do with the place... ...with the place we photographed yesterday? Of course not. Why would the photo be connected to a person I hit? Maybe his diligence to take photos is only for the time being. Not really, Amel. But you knew how it was. When we were simply friends... ...he was far more attentive towards me. But now, after only a month... ...we constantly fight. Maybe you're just being overly sensitive. Well, I'm not really sure myself. I'm confused now. Does he really need me? It's as if he cannot appreciate what I feel. I don't think that I act as complicated as you. I've never been hard on Bayu. I also feel that Bayu has his own world. Just like I do. That is why, you need to have trust. The main thing is trust. Maybe you're right. I should see Alvin now. Don't yell at him, okay? -Fine. -Give may regards for him. -Buy me lunch. -Okay. Be careful. -Ouch. -Where have you been, Honey? From the library. What are you doing? I'm checking my camera. I think something's wrong with it, but I don't know what it is. Honey. Let's go to the theater tonight. A good movie is currently playing. Not tonight. I have to go to the magazine's office to deliver the photos. So, you're busy again? Next week, okay? I promise, next week, we'll go watch a movie, okay? -Whatever. -Don't be angry. Inez. Inez. Inez! Hey! It's okay. Inez. I didn't kill my husband! I didn't know. Please, don't take me, Sir. I didn't kill my husband. I didn't know! Please, don't take me, Sir! I didn't kill my husband! I didn't know! I didn't know! I was told by Miss Neni to see you here. Yes, I told her that. I didn't kill my husband! I didn't know! What is it? That woman slaughtered her own husband. She sounds as if she's denying it. Well, it's shock. A psychological disorder. She is convinced that her body and soul are overtaken by a demon. She could remember nothing. Her actions were beyond her control. I'll have to think about it. How long are you going to wait? I've always asked you to go along to crime scenes during coverages. By being an intern in my office... ...you can hone your talent and potential, Alvin. Do you know... ...that on some of the cases I've encountered in crime scenes... ...the perpetrators believed that they were overtaken by supernatural forces. They committed the killing in a sadistic manner. It was brutal and unusual. Do you find it logical... ...when a father kill his own child? Hello? Yes. Okay. Vin, I'm sorry. I have to be at the office immediately. There's an editorial meeting. -See you later, then. -Thank you. Hi. I ran into you at the campus. Oh. I'm Alvin. Clara. We're in the same campus, aren't we? Yes. It's only been a week. A transfer student. No wonder I've never seen you before. I haven't had the chance to know anybody. Okay. If... If you need anything in the campus, just tell me. Okay? I should go. Bye. You are connected to the mail voice service of... What is wrong with you? -You look gloomy. -It's nothing. The electricity in the studio is out of order. -Seriously? -I don't know what to do. -Hello, Honey. -Hello. Honey. Were your cellphone inactive yesterday? It was active. Really? What is it, Honey? I called you all day yesterday. Maybe it was the signal. That may be. -What's the problem, Honey? -It's nothing. Inez, let it go. Well, I have to go now. Bye, Amel. Bye. Why was she angry? What's wrong? Forget it. She'll cool down. By the way, both of you seemed to be discussing something urgent earlier. -What was it? -Alvin was disturbed by ghosts. -Seriously? -No! Alvin, I believe in supernatural sightings. You were disturbed by ghosts. No. If you both believe in such things... ...obsessed in such things, then don't drag me with you. I don't believe in that and I never will. Fine. Then let's have some quality time. Let's go. Let's have a date, Honey. -Okay. -It's not easy being alone, is it? -Bye. -Don't forget to take your things. Okay. Thank you, Vin. -Hey, Alvin. -Hey. -How are you? -I'm fine. Don't you have any class to attend? I do. I just don't feel like attending. You don't like the teacher, do you? It's not that. I'm just not in the mood. -I should go now. -Okay. Honey, are you okay? I'm okay. I'm really worried about you. What's with you earlier? Did you fall? Yes, I fell upstairs. Honey. I'm sorry for being angry at the campus earlier. It's okay. I felt as if I was in another place. I don't know where. Lately I feel strange, Honey. I feel as if I'm being stalked by something. Like some kind of a dead person's spirit. I can't feel any peace. Honey, why didn't you tell me? I don't want you to worry. This must have something to do with one of the photos you've taken. Of course not, Honey. It's all just my illusion. That's why I never like it. I've always been uncomfortable with what you do. Going to scary places and photographing dead people. That could fill you mind with scary things. Maybe... ...what you experience lately is because of that. What is it, Honey? Honey? It's nothing. Honey. -It's afternoon. I have to go. -I'll take you. It's okay, I'll just get a taxi. It's fine. I'll take you. Where are you going? Just rest. We'll see each other at the campus tomorrow, okay? -Are you really fine with this? -Really, it's okay. Just rest. -Okay? Bye. -Okay, then. Be careful. -Hello, Honey. -Hi. Are you okay? I'm fine. I slept soundly last night. That's good. Honey, I'd like talk to you about something. Alvin. Just a moment, okay? Let me talk to Dodit first. -What is it? -Do you want to come along? What kind of exhibition? In Bentara Budaya. Please say yes. I don't have anybody else. Just you. (Alvin, if you're free tonight, can you accompany me?) I'll answer you tomorrow. I'll send you an SMS. -Call me. -Okay. Bye. Dodit asked me to go to a photography exhibition in Bentara Budaya. That's good. So? I don't know yet. I'll have to wait and see. There was a new SMS in you cellphone. Who is it? A friend. -Is it a girl? -No. Why don't you reply it immediately? I'll do it later. It's not important. It's not because I'm here, is it? No. What is it with you? It was from a girl, wasn't it? No. She's asking you to go out with her, isn't she? Whatever. Amel, do you think I'm being too hard on Alvin? Actually, we need to be hard occasionally... ...so our boyfriend would respect us. -Hello, Honey. -Hello. Give me your cheek. Where's Alvin? I don't know. Maybe in one his classes. Inez, stop bickering with Alvin, will you? -It's tiresome. -That's right, Inez. Before you were an item, you and him got along very well. Well, that's what I would've wanted. Who would want to constantly quarrel? The beginning of a relationship is commonly beautiful... ...that doesn't mean that problems would never come. It's just a matter of anticipating it, you know? Isn't that right, honey? Two heads in one brain. That's expected. But we've been getting along just fine, haven't we? It's different for everybody. It won't be the same. The first lady is furious. The menu. Please, eat. Why is there only one? Please give us one more. Take a look at this first. I have to go to the bathroom. Hello. Hello? Hello? -There was a phone call. -Who was it? I don't know. It was hung up. What if all this time when he said that he's out to take pictures... ...he's actually meeting that girl. My God, being a girl is so difficult. Don't let your thoughts get the better of you. Let it go. But his attitude is gradually more conspicuous. There's always odd things happening around him. Okay, but we need to investigate it to confirm that... ...whether he was really taking photos or not. Maybe he's done nothing wrong... ...and is truly in love with you. So smart in hiding things. I don't think I need more evidence. I'm becoming more convinced. Well, have it your way, then. I've tried my best to talk to you. Do you want some? No. I don't feel like it. I'll finish it, then. It's already empty. Get up! Hey! Your reading materials are so classless. -You've returned. -I just got in. Alvin. You need to read such books to open your horizon. Supernatural beings are as real as both of us. -They can communicate with us. -Come on. That's not worth the discussion. It would yield no profit. Besides, aren't you a coward? Screw you. By the way, Inez dropped by earlier. She waited for you until afternoon. She looked like she was very upset. Here's your lens. -I should go, then. -Hey, stay and keep me company. No. Bye. Be careful. There was a new SMS in you cellphone. Who is it? A friend. -Is it a girl? -No. Why don't you reply it immediately? I'll do it later. It's not important. It's not because I'm here, is it? No. What is it with you? It was from a girl, wasn't it? No. You haven't slept yet? Did you just get home? -Hi. -Hey. -Don't you have any class? -I just finished one. Are you free tonight? No. Please accompany me. -Where? -To go to my friend's house. There's an event but I don't feel like coming alone. Well? Okay. Hold on. Inez! Where are you going? You're infuriating. You're selfish. Why? You went out with a girl last night, didn't you? -No. -Alvin. I called you last night and a girl picked it up. Maybe you're wrong. -I... -Stop. You don't have to explain. Who was that? My girlfriend. Have you been with her long? We've only began dating recently... ...but we've been friends for a long time. I don't know what's wrong. Lately, we've been having bad time. We're having some problems. Let's cancel tonight, then. Okay, whatever. I'm hungry. Let's eat. -Do you have any coins? -No. Okay, thanks. I can't constantly live like this. I don't believe in mysticism, the supernatural, or occultism... ...but for the last few days I've been disturbed by that ghost. Alvin. When I came home from the studio... ...I was also juga harassed, Vin. I saw a ghost which was about to exit the garbage bin. I don't know about that. Why should I share your experience? Please try to remember, Alvin... ...maybe you've hurt someone a long time ago. That person's pain would linger until his or her death. Not to my knowledge. But I don't know how a person would feel. I can't read minds. If a person have a grudge for me... ...I wouldn't have thought too much of it. -So, now what? -I don't know. Maybe we shouldn't see each other for the time being. Why, Honey? Well, if it's about that issue, the let me explain it to you. What more could you explain to me? I know it's about that girl. There's nothing between us. I only love you. The problem is... ...you've been lying so many times lately. Nobody would want to be lied to. I'm not lying. Okay, I lied. I was wrong. I'm sorry. Enough. I need time to think. I want to figure out what we're actually doing. How long? I don't know. -Fine. -I need to rest. It's better that you go home. Hey! What the hell is wrong with you? -Sorry. -Hey. Idiot! I found you unconscious, so I took you here. It's as if we're destined to meet again. -I need to go home. -Just rest here for now. I live here alone. Still, I don't want to get into trouble. What matters is that you rest here for now. I'm willing and ready to listen to your grievances. I'm having a lot of problems. Problems with my girlfriend... ...the feeling that something is stalking me... What thing? I don't know. Maybe it's a ghost. Alvin, if I had to choose between having to fear a person or a ghost... ...I'd definitely be more fearful of a person. Why should you be scared of a human being? Do you know... ...that ghosts, demons, and all of those things... ...only thrives in our imagination. They can scare us but they don't necessarily hurt our feelings. Whereas a human being... ...could hurt us... ...physically... ...and mentally. A wound inflicted by a person... ...can incite grudge... ...maybe even for a lifetime. A person can be more ruthless than a ghost. Good idea, but I still have to go home. Just rest here for now. I'm sorry, Alvin. It's okay. But, for now... ...I need to redeem myself of my mistake. I realized that I really love my girlfriend. Your girlfriend is possessive, Alvin. Excuse me. You may not pass judgment about her. You don't know her. Amel, what is it? Amel! Amel, wake up! Please, wake up! Inez, what really happened? I really don't know, Bayu. -I don't understand it. -What did the doctor say? Inez? Inez. Are you okay? I'm okay. Alvin, I'm sure... ...that whatever happened to Amel is due to something supernatural. Come on, stop talking about that! -Please, use your common sense. -I really mean it this time. You said it yourself... ...the ghost's wasn't just focusing on you. -Look at Amel. -Okay. So? She's just depressed. You can experience that. I can experience that. -It's not a big issue. -I disagree with you. So, what do you want to do? Stop. Can't you see that Amel is dying? Okay, then. I should go. From your description... ...I think she was possessed. She's capable of harming people, even committing suicide. But what does the sentence that my friend wrote means? It's obvious that there's a special meaning. A message designed for a concealed purpose. So, the bottom line is that according to you... ...all of this has something to do with other wordly forces? Inez. If Amel did try to commit suicide... ...why did she make time to write on the wall with her own blood? Do you really think that's possible? I believe that the writing on the wall has some kind of meaning. Amel! Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! Please help the patient! Nurse, she's... Hey! Hi. Why are you here? How did you know where I live? I'm here simply to emphasize... ...how sorry I was about what happened earlier. Forget about it. It's okay. I like you, Alvin. Ah. Didn't I tell you about that? I love my girlfriend I don't want to disappoint her. So, the answer is no? No. It's late. I think I should go in. But, Alvin... I was reading a novel... ...then, suddenly, I strange woman appeared. She looked so terrifying and she was standing before me. I immediately felt cold... ...and I felt that my body was being controlled. It was so scary. I was terrified, Bayu. Afterwards, I regain consciousness. I could only scream. My hands felt very painful. Amel, do you remember... ...last night you acted as if you were possessed. I was also being terrorized. -But you're fine, aren't you... -Yes, I'm okay. Yes, Inez? Bayu. Get to Amel's house right now! Leave that hospital immediately! What? Leave that hospital immediately! Why? Just leave! Right now! Inez? -What is it, Bayu? -It was disconnected. I'm scared, Bayu. Why can't make this work? Push this one. It's narrow. So long. Inez! Inez! Wake up, Inez! Your friend, Inez. -Thank you. -Okay. Bayu told me about you. What's going on with you? I'm really sorry. I didn't think that my experience... ...would be affecting you and Amel. I really want to go away, Alvin. Where do you want to go? Wherever. Somewhere far away. I'm scared. I'm afraid of ending up like Amel. But where would you go? What's happening to you, Honey? Just tell me about your problem. If you keep crying, how am I suppose to know your problem? Clara. This is the girl that you suspected of going out with me. That's impossible. That's impossible, Alvin. Clara's dead! Don't you know? Clara is dead! -Hey, what is wrong with you? -Clara is dead! -What is wrong with you? -She's gone. -She's gone! -Calm down! Shut up! Tell me slowly. What is wrong? Clara was my friend. We were best friends. She's dead, Alvin. She's dead, Honey. She's gone. The three of us would go everywhere together. One day... ...they started dating. I didn't like the fact that they're dating. I don't know why that bothered my so much. What is it? Clara was my best friend. We were so close. Until one day... ...we met Boy. We were always together. But in the end... ...Clara had a relationship with Boy. I didn't like that. I finally lost control of myself. Clara! I'd like to explain this. I regret that. I finally asked Clara to meet me. Clara. I wanted to apologize. "Sorry"? I'm not interested in your goodwill. Would you like to hear how am I doing right now? I'm pregnant. He left and it's all because of you! So, what now? Clara. Stop it! Clara. Clara. I promise you, Inez... ...when you find the man you love... ...I'll return. I will make your lives a living hell. I will... I will make you pay, Inez. I will make you pay. Clara. Clara. Clara. I panicked. I was distressed. I was afraid of going to prison. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean to kill her. It was an accident. I could never tell... ..whether you're lying or not. I could never know that. Only you could know that. You don't really think... ...that I'm capable of killing someone, do you? I don't remember anything that time. It's impossible that you can't remember anything. Honey... ...everything happened so quickly. I actually didn't think... ...that you could do that. I wanted to tell you this, Honey. I sympathize with you, Inez. But this is too big. Honey, listen to me. You believe me, don't you? I'm not a murderer. -I'm not a murderer. -But you held the knife, didn't you? -You didn't know. You weren't there. -You held the knife, didn't you? Clara lost it! I only wanted to apologize... -...but she brought a knife. -But you didn't have to kill her! Pull yourself together. You're out of control. You screamed uncontrollably. I do love you, but that doesn't mean... ...that you could do this to me. I... I cannot bear this. This is too much for me. You need to take care of yourself. Get out! Clara. Clara. Damn it! Clara, stop. Clara. This is impossible. It's impossible. It's impossible. Clara. It's impossible. Go away. You're dead. Inez. I've been waiting for this moment for a long time. A moment where I can meet... ...my best friend to feel what I felt back then. Inez! Honey. Run! Hurry, Honey. Hurry! Go away. Help! It was exactly 12 AM when you took my life. And now I will also take your life. Honey. I'm back, Inez. This is impossible! You're dead, Clara! You're dead! You are right. But I would never forget my promise. Clara. Please, let me go. I didn't mean to do it. Let me go, Clara! Clara, let me go. Clara, I didn't mean to. Clara. Clara! Alvin. I'm sorry, Alvin. I used you to get my revenge for Inez. The woman you love. She has destroyed my life. You're a good man, Alvin. I love you. Inez! Inez. Inez. Inez. I hope you're strong enough to face all of this. Be patient. I love you.
