Whoa. This piece of shit. It's 300 all the way. Fly, drop, land, run, don't go back to Mexico, ever. Hey, babe. Just remember when you go to the grocery store to pick up... - Hey. - Where were you? - Uh, where? I'm on my flight. I'm talking to you on the Wi-Fi. What's uh, what's wrong. - I'm coming. I'm just in the bathroom. - Wait, is someone there with you? Megan came over. Uh, so what's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I feel good. I don't feel sick. Okay. Um, are you drinking? I've had a few glasses of wine. But I'm an adult. I can drink. I understand that, but, uh, did the doctor say that was... - The doctor says it won't kill me, so, is that enough of an answer? That's fine. You know what you're doing. Suddenly, you care. I always care. Just tell me that everything's gonna be okay. Um, Jen, you know, you and Megan go finish that wine, and I'm gonna be back before you wake up. How's that? - But you can't just say everything's going to be okay? I'm working on it right now. Okay? I... Okay, um... I'm sorry, honey, I got to go. - What was that noise? - It was the... I'm just calling the stewardess. I can't hear you. I... - The seat belt sign just came on. It's getting kind of bumpy. - Okay, well, call me later. - Yep. My man, my man. Yes? My man, can you hear me? Yes. You left so quick. - Yes. You said I was fighting the morning. - There's something I need to tell you. But listen, there are reports. - What-What reports? Reports of what? - They're packing up on the border. P- Packing up? Okay, I don't know what you mean. You mean they're... Yes, yes, my man. - Right, they're leaving or, like... - I don't know. - Okay, "packing up," like, leaving, or, you mean, like, "packing in"? - Radar, searchlights all over the border. Hello? Hello? Do you... Do you hear me? - Hello? - What's his name? It's okay. You knew this would happen. You knew this would happen. You are cool. Cool as... You're fine. Just do your job. Just do your job, Sean. What? Everything will be okay. Hi. Hi. You know, you should apologize. For what? - For the wholly unnatural thoughts about your body you make me have at night. Stop it. You're trying to be cute and it's not working. Not, not even a little? Maybe a little. - Uh, how long is Megan gonna be there for? Not much longer. She's on the phone with Jeremy right now. their kid just split her chin on the edge of the coffee table. - You really want one of those? A husband? - Yeah, that's exactly what I meant. - I'll let you know when I find one. - I can't wait to have a kid with you. - Yeah. Sean, you know that can't happen right now. I know. You know that... that moment that all couples say they have, when the... the house's a mess, and they're covered in vomit, and the kid's, like, finally sleeping for 45 minutes, and they look at each other like, "What the fuck did we do"? I am... I am actually looking forward to that. We're gonna be great at it. And I'm... I'm done flying. After this, I'm done. Is everything okay? the last time you said that, you left the Air Force. Hey? Yes? Hello? Okay. It's okay. You knew this would fucking happen. You knew this would happen. there's a change in plans. Uh, change? Change how? - New drop zone. Nothing you can't handle. - Wait, that's... That's 50 minutes away. Hello? Yeah, that is, that's 50 minutes away. Take or give. - Well, I barely have enough fuel for that. - You have enough. If you follow the course, you have enough. - Well, no, not really. This isn't the plan. Okay, you can't just... - My man, this is the plan. This is the new plan. Hey, hey, what was that? - Uh, it's nothing. It's the pressure. The oil pressure. Uh, it's, it's fine. I copy you on the new drop point. Jesus Christ. What? Oh, Jesus Christ! Fly. Fucking idiot can't get a phone. Okay, so, what, that's... 48 minutes out. Yes, what? Hey, sorry for the false start. Obviously having some trouble setting up the secure line. - What are you guys doing at the border? - What are you talking about? We're not at the border. - Don't lie to me. They're fucking scared. They already rerouted me. - Do you have the laptop? Is it secure? - Yes. Good. That's good. - No. I got to tell you, something feels off about it... - Hey, hey, Sean. You need to focus on your wife. She needs to get better. You are doing the right thing here. I promised you a new life and treatment for your wife. Didn't I? I trust you. Don't start doubting that, okay? - Okay. - I just want to make sure you understand what's expected of you here. Oh, shoot! Come on. What was that, Bloom? It was kind of hard to follow this time. What was hard to follow? - That line of bullshit you love to read me about how this is all for my own good. - We have a good thing going here. Yeah, you give me a laptop, I give you a new life. It's not bad for a night's work. I need those coordinates now. - Yeah, when I get them, you'll be the first to know. - What do you mean? You said they already sent them to you. Bye. So, 50... minutes of fuel, 48 minutes out. That's fucking... That's fucking... Yes? Hey, what happened? "Happened"? Uh, sorry? - You just climbed suddenly. Is there a problem? - No. No, no, no. No problem. - From this point on, you check in every 10 minutes. - Okay, what, I... - I want updates. I just call you on this line? - This behavior is not good, my man. We have decided to change your terms. - What do you mean, "change"? What behavior? What do you... Hey! Hello? Hello! It's fine, it's fine. Sean? Sean? Were you talking to someone? Talking to you. Thinking out loud. Did you get my voicemail? - Um, I'd rather hear it from the horse's mouth. What was it? It's just for... for when you land, for the drive home. Um... Uh, tell me about your day. Oh, my day, my day, my day... What'd I do today? Well, I... lay in bed for a while. This new medicine makes me feel like shit. Can't wait to get this damn operation over with. then I did laundry and thought about you. And then I took a bath so I could really think about you. then I decided the next time you take a long transport contract with the Peace Corps, I'm coming with you. - Shit! - What happened? Oh, I popped a button. Too many burritos. - Uh, no, they don't have burritos here. It's just... It's plates of rice and beans and the occasional tough flank. - Ugh. Sounds like the makings of a disgusting burrito to me. - No, I guess they do. Yeah, they have burritos here, but they're different. Everything is a little bit off here, you know? Like some bizarro Corpus Christi. It's so beautiful this time. those thin clouds are out, so... it's all blue, with orange streaks. Mm-hmm. You didn't see it, did you? What? - We watched the sunset together. I know it's stupid, but... they sent you to the same time zone this time, and we don't always get this lucky. It helps. Sean? Are you even listening? What? Jesus Christ! Ah, fuck! Hi, buddy. Hi, Bloom. - Pretty cool, huh? - What are you doing? It's a drone. Yeah, I can see that. I love it. It's got a feed that streams straight to my phone, so I can watch it on the shitter if I want to. - Man, I thought this relationship was built on trust. - No. Truth is, this relationship is built on paranoia and fear. But you'll be happy to know that I now trust that you'll do the right thing there. Is that clear? Are we good? - I can't talk right now. Hi, honey. Hi. I'm sorry. this is Statewide Health. Excuse me? - Yes, we handle all insurance claims through your Peace Corps program. I was wondering if I could have a minute of your time. - Uh, look, I'm really sorry. I don't mean to be a dick right now, but no, you can't. Um, and it's the middle of the night. - Yes, I apologize, sir, but there's an issue with your wife. What? - The claim you filed for your wife. Oh, right. No. Well, no. You know, yeah, call back another time. Oh, no. Hey, wait. Are you there? - Sir? - Uh, what's the issue? - The estimate for some of these procedures are being contested. - Yeah, I know, and then you guys denied her after you spoke with the goddamn medical folks. - Mm. I understand she needs a procedure for ovarian cancer, is that correct? Yes. - I have sympathy for these difficult times, but coverage for a Peace Corps contract isn't that extensive. Who was your previous insurer? - It was the United States Air Force. Okay. That helps. Yes, well, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you... - Sorry, you have to call me back, okay? - Sir... Let it go. Come on, Sean. It's not hard. Uh, hey. I have to ask you something. Okay. When are you getting home? - Uh, I don't know. Soon. Are you gonna be hungry? Uh... I don't know. Is that what you wanted to ask me? Megan's gone. - Okay, good. Then, um, yeah, you can get some sleep. Jen, please, can you just, like, have another glass of pinot and pass out? It's not pinot, it's... sauvignon blanc, Sean. - Whatever it is, kill it. I'll see you when I get home. Why were you in Mexico? What do you mean? I was... I was building a school for the Peace Corps. Don't do this, Sean! Please stop thinking that I'm a fucking idiot. Jesus. - I'm sick, and we don't have any money. So why do you keep saying that everything will be okay? I have a deal worked out with the Peace Corps, with the doctors. - You're not working out a deal as a Peace Corps contractor, Sean. they haven't sent you anywhere in months. So what the fuck are you doing in Mexico? - Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on. That's not fair. I called Dave, Sean. - Wait, wait, you called Peace Corps Dave? How did you get his number? - Yes, Peace Corps Dave. They didn't send you anywhere this week. It sure as hell wasn't the Air Force. - Jen, we should not be talking about this right now, okay? - Oh, no? Well, I'll be able to change the damn locks before you get home. Jen, don't... Jen! Come on! Jesus Christ! Shit. Let's see how good you are. Come on, come on! Come on! Yep. Come on. Come on. Yes! Yep. You're fine. Just do your job. Just do your job, Sean. Uh, are you... Um... Hey, can you roll down the window? Or turn on the air, please? Honey, they, um... they gave me a bonus. They... Fuck. Passport. What? - My man, my man, come on, come on. - No. Uh, no. We don't do that. That's never been part of the deal. When you came into Mexico, they stamped you in at the airport, no? Yes. - And when you leave, we stamp you out. Satellite phone, GPS, you leave everything when you land. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I know. You have enough fuel to make it to the drop. - How much fuel? - Enough. But you need to leave now. You're fighting against the morning at this point. - Uh, what the hell's that? - That is your cargo. Well, that's supposed to be 25 kilos. That has to be double that. It is what it is. Jen, I'm sorry, okay? I don't have time for this right now. Please just go to sleep. I don't have time for this either. If something happened to you doing whatever it is your doing, where would that leave me? - Just please try not to think about that right now, okay? Just believe me. I know... I know what I'm doing. Oh, shit. - What? - That car is back. What car? Some car keeps... coming to the driveway, turning around. Must be lost. I don't know. What was that? Jen! - Broke a wine glass. - Okay, Jen, lock the doors. - I just got these! Shit! - Sean. - Hey, did you send someone to my house? Jen says there's someone in my driveway. - What? No. Why would I? - If I find out that you send your boys around there, I... You said she was out of t... - Jen! - This is Karen with Statewide Insurance. - Oh, Jesus! What the f... - Sir? - You guys just called me. Okay? This is not a good time. - Uh. We must've had our logs crossed. - Yeah, just call the Air Force insurance office. They will tell you Sean Haggerty was dishonorably discharged, and all benefits were revoked, you got that? - Okay. Mr. Haggerty, we'll get right on that. Thank you. What the fuck? Yep. Is this Sean Haggerty? Uh, this is, yeah. - Sean, I'm calling on behalf of your employer. Is there a problem? What employer? You have more than one? Uh, nope. No, no. I read you. Is there a problem? No. No problem. That's good. Yeah. Everything's on schedule. That's good news. I'm going to be frank. there're suspicions. What do you mean, suspicions? No. I'm doing everything you want. The package is on time. - Nevertheless, our employer has suspicions. No one in particular, but still, you should be aware. - You can trust me. Of course you can trust me. Uh, what's your name, sir? - Mallory. - Mr. Mallory, I guarantee you that nothing is wrong. Everything is going off according to the plan. - Guarantees mean a great deal to me. I told our employer that I guarantee every package they have crossing the border today will arrive safely. You don't have to worry about me. I know I don't. Is there anything else, sir? No. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'll be in touch. Shit. Shit. Okay. Shit. Come on, come on, come on. - Hey, this is Jen. Leave a message. - Uh, hey, Jen. Uh, it's me. Um, I-I hope you're sleeping, but still, if you, if you get this, can you just call me back? Okay. Thanks. Spread 'em. - That's... That's my payment. - You're not packing, John Rambo? Uh, no. I'm not packing. Why not? - And we normally, we just call him "Rambo." Rambo. - Drugs, a laptop, anything else you want me to carry? - Hey, this is Jen. Leave a message. Uh, Jen, I-I... Look. Uh, it's me again. I'm-I'm... If you get this, I know, I... If you get this and you don't want to talk, I- I-I get it, I understand, but please can you just text me or something? Okay. Uh, I love you. Jen? Sean, buddy, I'm getting tired of this. The coordinates, now. - I don't have them. You give me that laptop, Jen gets her surgery. that is the deal. Don't forget it. Yeah, believe me, I haven't, okay? I know you're not doing this 'cause we're old pals. I can get you what you want. Just give me a few seconds to myself, please. - Where is the drop? tell me now or I'm going to lose my shit! - What does it even matter. I thought you had a crack team of Nevada Top Guns tracking me. Hey, boys! - If you want us to protect you, we need to know where you're going to be. I don't want a camera circling your corpse from 300 feet above. Haggerty? - Shit. Shit! - Hey, what's going on up there? - Shoot! Sean, I have a team standing by. Okay? You just... - Yeah, I got to go. Okay, what is this, now? Hello? Jen? Do you love your wife? Mallory. I will ask again... - Okay, listen to me, asshole. I'm not going to fucking... Do you love your wife? Yes, I do. Say it louder. I... I love my wife. - Now, I need you to understand that this has absolutely nothing to do with you. I was called into service because a problem was discovered at the airfield. W- What problem? - Again, nothing to do with you. But to be safe, extra measures needed to be put in place - in order to ensure that... - Extra measures? - ... the plan is carried out to its conclusion. So are we clear? You do understand? Th-This is a mistake! You don't have to do this. We're not going to be... Okay. I'm gonna explain how all this is gonna play out. The new coordinates have been uploaded to your craft. Will you confirm? - Yes. - You will land there. I'll be waiting to collect the cargo and the craft. Your wife will be with me. - Well, how-how can I trust you? Because you must. - She has a condition. - Yes, we know. We know. - She has pills that she has to take in the morning. Once we determine that the cargo and the craft are unmolested, you and Jen will be set free, and there'll be plenty of time to take all the pills she needs. Now, would you like to speak with your wife, Sean? Hello? Jen, where are you? I don't know. I'm in a car. I was in the kitchen, and the next thing I knew, they dragged me out, and I'm here in a car. Listen, we have a way out. I'm coming for you right now. What did you do? - I... I... It doesn't matter right now, okay, but I, I'm sorry, and I'm gonna... I'm coming to get you. I don't... I don't... Wait, but... - I don't know what to do right now. I'm sorry. Everything is going perfectly. I've been in this position many times before. I know. You're doing great. there's an exercise I'd like to... leave with you when I hang up. You should make a list of all the things that you love about your wife, but more importantly, you should make a list of all the things you'll miss if she were to be suddenly taken away from you. You are a sick fuck. - I say these things for your own good, Sean, and for Jen. Fuck! Fucking fail at fucking everything! - I'm here. - You have to shut it down, okay? The operation, whatever you're calling it... just not this time. - Signed the paperwork this morning, buddy. Got your new name, background, right here. You and Jen. Don't try to change things, Sean. You're an asset. - I'm a fucking pilot, okay? I flew night sorties, and I... Nobody cares. The Navy, FAA's not gonna let you anywhere near a pilot's license. You're a drug mule, Sean, a beast of burden on borrowed time. Don't think for a second you're anything more. They have Jen. Who does? They took her. - They took her? - Yes, they took her. - What the fuck are you trying to pull? - Yeah, they were at my house, okay? they took her. that's all that matters. - Who has her? - I don't know. Some guy named, uh, Mallory. He's taking her to the drop point. I'm landing there. So the plans have changed. Do they know about me? Do they know about what we're doing? - I don't know. I don't think so, okay? the guy said it has nothing to do with me. I don't know why, but... I believe him. Hmm. You trust him? - I don't... I don't... I'm not saying I trust him. I'm saying I believe what he says. - Okay, Sean. I can help you. - No. You can help me by staying out of this, okay? You need to stay out of this. - When did you get permission to give me fucking orders, huh? You will fly, you will land, and you will stall until we can secure you, your... fucking wife, this Mallory, and anybody he has with him. And only when I deem you worthy of being released from my custody will you be allowed to start your new pathetic life in whatever town, backwater America. You will get me that laptop, Sean. It cannot fall into the wrong hands. Sorry, Bloom. - What? Sorry for what? What are you talking about? Sean, what are you... What's going on? What the fuck was that? Sean, what are you doing? Stop it! Sean, you don't wanna do this. What the fuck is wrong? Sean? Sean, can you hear me? Fuck! Drone's down. We'll be in touch. Okay, so, what are we? Uh, 50 degrees north by... Okay, so, figure in 30 minutes. Great. Okay. Okay. - Uh, this is Sean. - Are you on schedule? - Uh, yeah, I'm set to land in 30 minutes. - When you land, you will exit the aircraft... - Perfect. I'll see you there. - Once the package has been secured, your wife will be released. And when you land, exit and step away from the aircraft. Slowly. I would not want to have to fire on you. - No. No, don't do that. No one would want that. Uh, is-is that everything? Just to be clear; land and exit the craft with your hands high. - Is-Is Jen with you? - Now, is that all perfectly clear? - Yes, perfectly fucking clear! Is my wife with you? Of course. Is she safe? - If you don't trust me at this point, I'm afraid we won't be able to continue business. Yep. Okay. That was really fucking stupid, Haggerty. - I have everything under control. - I don't want you to have everything under control. That's my job. - Jesus, stop thinking about your job for one second of your life. - Thinking about my career is exactly why you're not in fucking prison right now! What did I say when we started down this path? - I don't know. - I said, "You have to tell us where your wife is at all times during this operation, for her own safety... Tell me what you love about your wife. God, why do you need this from me? Why are you doing this? - What would you miss most if she was gone? I- I can't think of anything right now! What was she doing at home? You said she was going to Arkansas to visit her family. - She's under enough stress. I didn't need your trigger-finger cadets breathing down her neck when she's not even involved in this. This part of my life is over, okay? You said so. Jesus. She doesn't know about any of this, does she? - She knows that I love her, I hope. - She doesn't know she has to close her life down in the morning and start a new one. Well, don't worry too much. She'll probably leave you when she finds out. Hey, my love, just reminding you when you go to the grocery store to please pick me up some milk. - Sean, listen to me. - One percent, not two. I can't deal with that stuff you drink. It's like... - Sean. - No, I just... I... I would miss her. I would miss everything about her. But I... I can't think of anything specific. I know that's shit. I... I can't. Don't do this, Sean! Don't! I'm a shitty husband. God! Hey, my love, just reminding you when you go to the grocery store to please pick me up some milk. Don't do this! Stop lying to me, please! We got a video. the director got a video. I am so fucked. So? - There was a man at the airstrip, a Mexican federale who was working with the cartel. He was about to start working for us. He's the reason you had that laptop. Octavio Hernandez. Cartel found out he was playing both sides. Poured jet fuel down his throat. threw a match at him. What? I... This is not my fault. Now, you listen to me. - Can I... Can I talk to her? Please! - She doesn't wanna speak to you right now, Sean. She's only going to be safe once she's in a federal protection program. Hold the line. Oh, and eggs. And if you have time, uh, I guess I'm just asking you to make me some breakfast. Will you please make me breakfast when you get home? Mexico just cleared five simultaneous air strikes within their borders. That doesn't happen if we don't get what's on that laptop. - Air strike? What are you talking... This is why they have Jen, okay? This operation, this whole thing, it's too big. I would never have agreed to this if I knew. Okay, can you just tell her what I meant when I said I was done flying? What I... I meant that I'm done... I meant that I love her and I am done hiding from her and us and I am sorry and I love her. Please, please tell her that, okay? You don't have to do anything else. Please tell her that. I love you. No. Okay, f... You're only a couple miles from the border, aren't you? - Yeah. So, yeah, maybe, whatever. I mean, it's a big border, Bloom. - Yeah. You're right. I don't know exactly where you are, but I do know you're well within range of a U.S. Border Patrol heliport. And that department owes me a couple of favors. What? What? What? Don't do this, Bloom. I didn't do this. You did. Do not do this, Bloom. Oh, shit! Bloom? Bloom! Shit! Goddamn it! Fuck! Come on! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Bloom! Oh, God. Oh, no, no, no! No! No! Get over here! Jesus! Jesus Christ! Come on! What the fuck? Shit! Stop! - Hello, this is Bloom. - Bloom, they're going to drive me straight into the ground! - What are you talking about? - They're shooting at me! - What? I told them no. Hang on. Hello, this is Bloom. - Yeah, I know who the shit you are! - Shut the fuck up, Sean. I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to border patrol. - They're coming around... coming around again. Jesus, say it! We are on the same side! Say it! - They're patching me through. Just hang on, Sean. Hello? Yes? Yes, am I talking directly to the pilot? - No, God! This is not happening right now! Okay, well tell your men to stand down. I said I need that plane in one piece. Shit! Listen to him! - I said stand down! No deadly force! - Shit! Come on, Bloom, repeat it, please. Do not authorize deadly force! What? No, no, no, no. No, not good, not good, not good! No! Shit! Oh, come on! Okay, yes, I get it! Everybody calm down! Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay, easy. Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on, come on. There are no vital signs. I don't understand. I'm sorry, but you have lost the child. There is something else, an irregularity. I... I was... - We need to keep you here for additional tests. What did I do wrong? Hey. Hey, hey, hey. - We did nothing wrong. - I don't understand! No, no, no. this is not us. It's not us. How do you know? - It's just a fucking terrible thing for that to happen. Dry. Fucking dry. Dry. Okay. Hey, my love, just reminding you when you go to the grocery store to please pick me up some milk. I forgot it again. One percent, not two. I can't deal with that stuff you drink. It's, like, practically butter. Oh, and eggs. And if you have time, uh, I guess I'm just asking you to make me some breakfast. Will you please make me breakfast when you get home? I love you. Sean. You have made an unscheduled stop. Why? My fuel line was, um... - What happened to the fuel line? Uh... it broke. - The people above me will insist on a very thorough report. Well, uh, tell them... tell them that the fuel line was cracked, and since I had to leave without a pre-flight check, I didn't have time to catch it. - Is that what happened, or are you just having me repeat a lie? - You make reports on all your kidnappings? - Our employers are very thorough, Mr. Haggerty. - Yes. That is what happened. And Mr. Mallory, my wife can never remember the fucking milk. She always forgets it 'cause it made her sick when she was younger, so they never had it in the house. But ever since we got married, she finds out that she loves it. Only the one-percent, though. She's... She's very specific about that. She needs me to get that for her tomorrow morning. We'll be arriving in 13 minutes. If you're not there in 20 minutes, Jen dies. - No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'll be there. I must report in 20 minutes. If our employer doesn't have confirmation of your landing... - I will be... I will there. I swear. I swear to you. Mr. Mallory, I will be there. You don't have to worry about me, sir. If I have to kill Jen, she will have to be dissolved in acid, because I can't guarantee a precursor of a bullet. - Please, you don't have to do this. We will fuck off quietly. We will go quietly out of your life. Please, you don't have to do this. - Don't think for a moment that you are the only one with something to lose in 20 minutes. As I said, our employer's thorough, punctual, and viciously effective. Now, that's a fact. Would you like to speak with your wife again? Tell her I'll see her soon. Okay. Okay. Extra full. Flaps, 10 degrees. Come on, come on. Faster, faster, faster. Fucking fall apart in like, 10 minutes. Jesus, come on. Oh! Okay, there we go. There we go. Come on. Baby, come on! All right, moving. Clearing... should be... should be right below. No. No. - Son of a bitch. - Where are you? - Staring down at your fucking SUV. Why are you doing this? - The director decided you needed to be intercepted at all costs. - They're going to kill her, Bloom! What part of that don't you understand? - Yeah. Sorry. - How did you know? How'd you know I was going to be here? - Helicopter pilots. they intercepted your heading. Wetlands were always a candidate for a cartel drop. Just needed someone to confirm. - For the love of Christ, Bloom, tell them to stand down for like 10 minutes, okay? They don't see the SUV yet, but if they do... It's out of my hands, okay? Just get to Jen as fast as you can. She might have a shot. Asshole! Come on. Okay, just fucking get there, Sean. Okay, come on, you piece of shit. You can outrun an SUV. Come on! Four minutes. Okay, come on, come on. That's where we are. Now, come on. Let's hit that clearing. That's all you got to do. There it is. That's it. That's it. Right there. Okay. Okay, we're coming in. This is almost fucking over. Fucking... Uh, hey, Mallory, um, I'm on my final approach. Everything seems solid, but I got to warn you about something.
