Nothing grew... and there was no life... except in one place, the Blue Mountain... where the Blue Gnomes live. By the light of the moon on top of the Blue Mountain... grew the juiciest blueberries. And one day, these blueberries changed everything, because there is something else in the Blue Mountain, the Magic Silver. By a small accident... the gnomes discovered the secret of the Magic Silver. That's how the very first magic hour began. But good things never come without obligations. The mountain understood that it was a secret to be kept. And every Blue Gnome that's outside when the mountain closes... will disappear forever. Because you can not just come and go as you want... if your job is to create light to bring to the world. Every morning and every evening we make the magic hour... and bring night and day to the world. That is the reason for our existence. That is why we Blue Gnomes are where we belong. We are where people need us. The mountain gives to us... -And we give to the mountain. What is our most important rule? When we borrow we give back. Yes, that's right, Princess Bluerose, but we have another one. Blue Gnomes always help each other. -Yes, that is also an important rule. But the most important thing... It is time for the magic hour. -I want to see it. Father? No, but... -Just go. Hey, wait. Hey. Hey. Hey. We can never allow foreigners in the Blue Mountain. Nobody is allowed to find the Magic Silver. Do they know that rule? You with your rules. Of course they know that. The magic hour comes. The magic hour comes. Glittering silver and berries so blue. Open the mountain for your gnomes so faithful. Let life bring light for everything that grows... and flourishes in the great world below. The Magic Silver changes the night into day... so that everyone who is young is allowed to play. Doesn't that look nice? -Yes. When I was as many winters as you were I went for a sleigh ride. The cold bit into my cheeks and I had butterflies in my stomach. Don't you want to try it once to go outside? Yes of course. -Really? But wha if the sleigh goes too fast and I can not stop? Or if I get lost and the mountain closes? Maybe another time. Is something wrong? No, it is nothing. Bluerose, do you want to help me ring the bell? See you soon, Father. All gnomes inside. The magic hour is over. Erke and Tufsa, the mountain is closing. Hurry up. That was close. Catch. Give it to me. Where did it go? Oh no... What is that? This goes to the ancients who know all the answers. Only gnomes that are from the royal family are allowed. Well? A princess is probably not good enough. Let's go to the throne room. Bluerose. That is the best pine cone that I have ever found. Please. Erke... let her go. She is not courageous. Hello, my little girl. Why do you look like you lost your blueberry basket? If a gnome is afraid of almost everything... how can she ever become courageous? If you are never afraid, you can never be brave. What do you mean? Courage is doing something that you would not dare to do. On the day that something is really important... that gnome will be brave enough. What will I ever do without you? Bluerose, can you excuse us? Why? -Because... this is only for those that the matter has to do with. I want to deal with it. You have to wait. Today it is not yet necessary. So. Forget it. Go away, you. Go. Would not wild reindeer milk help? Or I can ask the ancients. Maybe they know a medicine. You have lived a long life. You only see gray. Your life is almost over. That's the way it is. Fairytales! The Mountain King is going to tell fairytales! Hello? Old wise gnomes? What is this noise all about? Only members of the royal family may come here. Don't you see that she is the daughter of the Mountain King? Princess Bluerose. I wondered who's crown it was that would not shine. Do not be so impatient. It will shine... if she performs actions that are worthy of a queen. She is not courageous enough to be queen. I'm not coming for myself. My father can no longer see blue. If you lose your blue vision, the mountain will claim you. There must be something to heal him. His time has almost come. -That is what happens. There is one thing. Something that the houses have. -What? Previously, when I was young... I heard a bunch of housedwellers crying at a sickbed. They said they could save the patient... if they had one thing. They called it 'money'. Money? What is that? I do not know. It must be something magical... if it can cure the sick. Where can I find these houses? -They are dangerous. If housedwellers look at you, you will disappear. They live down in the valley. Outside the Blue Mountain. The magic hour comes. Do not worry, father... I will find some medicine. Are you going outside? But you never go outside. Am I dreaming? What are you doing here? -I need help. So now you want help. Yes, it is dangerous to be alone. -You think everything is dangerous. Erke, Blue Gnomes always help eachother. You did not help me with my pine cone. Why would I help you? Is it really dangerous? -You know me. Yes. Can I borrow your sled? Have fun. Well, at least you're down. -Do not look at me! I don't have to. But open your eyes. You almost clashed against a gnome king. Gnome king? Really? Here. Really? -Your king is here for you. I am Dreng, King of the Red Gnomes. Red Gnomes? Do they exist? -Exist? The world would stand still without us. We take care of the farms and the animals. That's how it is. Where are you going? To the Red Gnomes on the farm. Are there housedwellers? -Yes. Then I will go there too. I am expected in the stable. -What does money look like? It is round, it shines, and it fits into a pouch. Thank you, Dreng. -Thank you... Bluerose. Watch out that the farmer does not see you, Bluerose. Because then... Hey? Two, three... 14, 15, 16... Hi. I just got out of bed. -They are waiting for you. Come. I'm first. -No me. Is it that time again? I can not help it. It smells so good. No. Enough fun, children. Go into the pantry to pick up some salted meat. Take as much as you can. And then some more. Is your stomach not fat enough yet, Pens? They are coming. Wake up, the queen is here. What is all this noise about? You are not our queen. The Queen of the Red Gnomes is too old to travel. She passed on the throne to her son. I am Dreng, your new king. More is needed than a crown to be a king. A king is a man, not a boy. I am a good king. Look at how my crown shines. And was it not the queen that made it shine like that? What is that? Bluerose, a Blue Gnome that I encountered. A Blue Gnome? You are not only too young, you also take in foreigners? With hats in the faded color. I will not stay long. The magic hour is almost over. The farmer is coming. He can not see us. Hide everything and everyone. Where are you? I know you're here, bunch of predatory Gnomes. He is looking for us. He has never done that before. What did you say? Gnomes? He is leaving. We have to flee. Run. Mother! -Father! Why is he angry with us? -Have we caught too much food? Housedwellers do not do that for just a little bit of food missing. It must be something else. It was you. You asked me about money. You have stolen money from the farmer. -Bluerose. Return the money. -No, my father will die. The ancients said that money is the only thing that can save him. I understand that you want to save him. But who will save us? Where will we go? Erke, go get Rimspa. Quickly. We are here. Come this way. Come in all. What is our most important rule? We borrow and give... -Not that rule. We help each other if necessary? -No. Never take foreigners to the Blue Mountain? So why is the Blue Mountain then full... of gnomes with the wrong color hat? Rimspa? Didn't I tell you that you should not get so excited? My princess. What? Have you been outside? Yes. I had to, it was necessary. I found something to make you better. A human possession? It's money. I borrowed it from the farm. You can not borrow from the houses. Who knows what it leads to? In any case the farmer got angry... and we have lost our house. Who are all these Blue Gnomes? They are not Blue Gnomes. They have red hats on. Foreigners? In the Blue Mountain? They could not go anywhere else. Well maybe if you give that money back. But, father... During the next magic hour you have to give back what you have borrowed. We can not trust her. Maybe she'll steal something else. Someone has to go with her. The boy who wants to be king. He brought her to the farm. Well, then we will now see whether he is truly cut from royal wood. Good. So be it. -Use the money for until then. No. You know what the law requires. -You know what that would mean. She was not allowed to let Red Gnomes in. She only wanted to help them. That's what I mean. She should have known better. You know that. Imagine if they find the Magic Silver. I could have eaten the whole valley... if it had been full of porridge. If you are hungry... then think about how Pens must feel. Yes. Where is he? No, that is not going to happen. Here only Blue Gnomes are allowed. What is that glow? That does not concern you. Go back to your friends with their red hats. Why didn't you say that you were a princess? I do not really feel like a princess. Sometimes I do not really feel like a king. Why didn't he take the money? -I do not know. But maybe we will feel better if we give it back. That will not help my father. -But the Red Gnomes it will. I do not see the farmer. Come. -Wait. I don't know if I have the courage. Me neither. But if you never fear you can not be courageous either. Hurry up. Under the table. Good day, Bjornar. Come on in. What do we do now? -Quiet. I do not know. Look. I see that you have pulled out all the stops. Tablecloth, silverware... -I had just enough. It is not bad that there is sometimes something to eat that disappears, but now... they have started stealing money. And that is not all. My pocket watch is gone. And my medals. I did not take that. Then someone else steals. Just wait, bunch of predatory Gnomes. Gnomes? -Yes. But I'll get them. Maybe we should not say anything about gnomes to the guests. Gnomes will not make a good impression on Solveig. I mean, who believes in gnomes? Look. I picked it up last night. Look at that. -Not bad, is it? Is it not beautiful? Would she see me? -Of course. Let's not speak anymore about gnomes, okay? There they are. Hi there. Hello, Solveig. I'll help you. We have to go back. The magic hour is almost over. But then they will see us. You probably have never seen such a Christmas table. It looks delicious. Yes, but you have to notice all that silver. I am not a poor man. Solveig? -Yes. I... Never mind. I have to go back to the Blue Mountain. Sit here. -What a feast, Halvor. Everyone have a seat. We have to go. Good... I am not a great speaker, so this can take some time. I have to get out of here. -In friendship... we sit around this table. -We have to go. So raise your glass. Cheers. -Now. Cheers. Did you see that? They ran out, with hats on. Gnomes... It is... Let's... Thieves! Predatory Gnomes! I have had enough of you. Do you hear me? I'm done with this. Hurry up. Faster. Have you returned the money? Can we go home? We have returned the money. But someone else is stealing from him. He thinks it's you. When we go back to the farm... we will grab that thief. But then he might catch us. Do what you want. You can not stay here. You are throwing us out? This is all your fault. It is not our fault. They said someone else is stealing. Everything went well... until a certain Blue Gnome stole something from that farm. Listen. I want to say something. Hey! Listen to him. Dreng has something to say. If we give the farmer something that he would like to have... he might let the Red Gnomes return. But we have nothing. We would give him some Magic Silver. Bluerose! -Magic Silver? Was that what I saw there shining like that? The Magic Silver can never leave this mountain. Otherwise we can not make the magic hour. And the world will be shrouded in eternal darkness. How could you suggest such a thing? Can a little silver in one or the other caves be so important? The Magic Silver stays here. It is not yet the magic hour. I'm coming in. Bunch of predatory Gnomes. He must have followed us. Did you bring a housedweller here to the Blue Mountain? We have no choice. Give him the silver. You heard them. We can not take the silver. They just want it for themselves. They know their mountain better than we do, Pens. Are we going to listen to someone whose head is too small for his crown? Are we going to stay here waiting until the farmer picks us up? Or are we going to give him the silver so that we can return to our stable? To the Magic Silver. Everyone out. Where are you? Where is my ring? I need that ring... This is not a ring. But it is beautiful. That ended well. It is getting darker. -So it begins. Father! This is all your fault, Bluerose. You have broken our rules. What we are experiencing now... is the end of the reason for our existence. Your Highness... you have to do what needs to be done. Father? You have to leave the Blue Mountain... and you may never come back again. I'm so sorry, Father. I wish I could come with you to take care of you. Me too. Maybe the farmer would want this. There is more in Pens' box. The farmer's ring? You? You predatory gnome! Predatory? Predatory? I have worked hard for all of this and nobody is taking it away from me. Give me that! Wait, this is not the magic hour. Is it safe for you? I would never be so bold, Erke. Where are you going? You always know so much... so you know where I am going. The mountain is disappointed. It will not be easy to correct this. I have no strength anymore. Your successor is now your only hope. And who is that? -The same that it always was. Bluerose. -Bluerose? This is all her fault. She made all the wrong decisions. Oh yeah? Look at her crown. But how... -We still have to see how this ends. It's all mine. Make sure you get next to him. Get off! Bluerose! Hold on, Dreng! Brats, I'll show you! Not bad, King of the Red Gnomes. At least we can now go outside and pick up pine cones. When all the trees die, there will be no more pine cones. And grain? For the porridge? There will be no more porridge. No porridge? That is impossible. Nothing is possible without the Magic Silver. But you preferred to listen to Pens. Yes, I regret that now. There is a difference between foraging and stealing. I thought it was the fault of the Blue Gnomes. Of course, I know what we have to do! If we can do one thing well, it's foraging. And when we make a mess, we also clean it up. Red Gnomes, we must forage for the Magic Silver. Not without the help of the Blue Gnomes. Look. That is too heavy for us. How can we do this? In the way of the Blue Gnomes. So, now we just need the farmer to go outside. I'll do that. In the way of the Red Gnomes. Horse, Daisy, Goat... let me hear you! What the hell? What is going on here? Pull. Hey, calm down. Calm down. Ready. Why are you restless, Daisy. Quiet, I am here. The farmer won't miss this. Take it and save your father. No... not if the whole world is in danger. You are the bravest Gnome that I have ever met. It doesn't work. It's too heavy for us. And for us? Is it too heavy for all of us? It's mine. -Stay away, Pens. No, you do not need that, Pens. I'll came to see how you are doing. -Me? Fine, you know. But I'm glad you're here. I want to show you something precious. You've never seen anything like it. Leave it, if our Christmas porridge is dear to you. Come on in. -Pens! Thank you. Go to the living room. It's on the table. Do not look at me! Come. What? I swear it was here. Everything is here, Halvor. But this is not... -It's beautiful. But I do not care about such things. I like you, with or without silver. So, now we can only wait... and hope. I could not save Pens. A king can not do everything for his gnomes. Certain things gnomes have to do for themselves. Bluerose. Don't throw it too far. -No. Where are you going, Bluerose? Do not worry about me. I'm going now. There are certain rules Blue Gnomes adhere to. When we borrow we give back. We always help each other. And we remain where we are most needed. I think I speak on behalf of everyone... when I say that we need you here, Bluerose. Please stay. There is nothing I'd prefer more. Father? My little blue girl. Do you know how happy I am to see you? I have lived for a long time. The mountain is calling me. But what do I do without you? The same thing you do now. And you do that excellently. Tell me how it was outside the Blue Mountain. I rode on a sled and fell hard. The houses there had shutters made of glass. -Oh, did they? -And it was... You are always welcome to come back. As long as you do not try to make us porridge... That can sometimes take a very long time. The magic hour for evening has started. Your friends are leaving. Do you want to say goodbye to them? I'll be back. Dreng! Goodbye, Dreng... King of the Red Gnomes. Goodbye, Bluerose, Princess of the Blue Mountain. And so became a small frightened princess... the bravest queen that the Blue Mountain has ever experienced. Now everything is back as before... in the Blue Mountain... and below the mountain. Porridge! And so the smallest boys can become the greatest kings. And people can believe in gnomes... and in love. Bye, Father. Goodbye, Bluerose. Bluerose will become an excellent queen. I have always said that. -So true! So true!
