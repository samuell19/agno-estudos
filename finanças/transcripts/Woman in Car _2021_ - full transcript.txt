I'll take the Deep Six FMJ. - Hey. - Ah! Did you find anything? Maybe. Oh, the key. I'll make some room. Look, I've got to go or I'm gonna miss my flight. Give my regards to Charlotte. I'll see you soon. We're out of milk. How was your day? Emma, get your sweater! Don't forget Aunt Charlotte's card. Owen! Emma stay here! You can look at him from the... You're too big for me. Too big for that! Welcome back, Owen. You got bangs or something? Your hair's different. How was the drive? Where is he? David? He's out of town for the week. Safiye, this is my stepmother Anne. Hello. You must be Emma. Are you also at the music faculty? No, I'm not musical, I'm afraid. Where's your accent from? She's from Turkey, but we met in New York. And I lived in London, for a long time before that. And now Montreal. Yes. Are you happy to be here or just bored? I'm not bored. Good. We're having rabbit for dinner. You can throw it. What do you mean, a sword? What do I mean, a sword? Hey, we're gonna need to bring a lot more snow to make the... A piano. Are you tired? No. Owen. ♪ One, two, three, four, five, six... ♪ ♪ One, two, three, four, five, six... ♪ At the end of your message, press one. Mommy! To Charlotte. - To Charlotte! - To Charlotte! And to my dear brother Fraser. I only wish twins died the same day too. It would make it more bearable. But to the return of his talented son and to Anne's marriage to the lovely David. May they live in happiness. David's mother and I used to play in the same park when we were babies. Our nannies were best friends. Now we're on just about all the same grey-haired volunteer committees. Life is funny. Owen, are you bringing the plates? Just a tiny piece for me. We're so happy to have you back, aren't we Anne? Yes. Safiye, I've been meaning to drop by your shop. I have a rocker I'd like you to look at. I work evenings usually, but my boss can help you in the daytime. She's a night owl. How long did you live there? Nearly 15 years. That's almost all your life! Hmm. Delicious cake. Spending 20 years in Paris was the best thing I ever did. It strengthened me. We have a long line of strong women in the family. Did you know Anne was an athlete? Yes. She almost went to the Olympics, almost. An almost Olympic athlete amongst us. Let's finish all this wine. Anybody? I'll have some. I'll have one. Ha! That's the first time I see you have more than a sip of wine! Are you finally giving up your athlete ways and joining the human race? I need to talk with you. I wish David were here this weekend. Such a shame he's away right before the wedding. Well, time apart before builds up the romance all the more! Stop it! Emma. Emma! Sit in your own chair! - It's fine. - Emma. It's fine, it doesn't bother... Can you not interfere? Anne? The money for this month couldn't go directly into your account. Everything was frozen. Here. But by next month everything will be back to normal. I know today must be as hard for you as it is for me. We loved our Fraser so. Happy birthday. Bye. I'm going to the store, does anybody want anything? - You drank. - I'm fine. - Just let me drive. - I'm fine. - Give me the keys. - No. - Just let me... - I'm fine! You're not fine. Don't smoke in here. Emma will be up soon. Safiye's gone. - What? - She must've hitched. Did you say something to her? Did you tell her? Tell her what? I told her how he died. What did you say? A hit and run. - Nothing else? - No. If she saw you, she'll say something to Charlotte. - No she won't. - You saw them together. - So what? - If she thinks something, Charlotte will get it out of her. Safiye wouldn't say anything even if she did think something was going on. You don't know what people like her... - People like what? - People who have nothing. Where is he? South America. Do you really expect me to go to the wedding? They'll wonder why you're not there. - Who will? - Charlotte, everyone. Who cares what she thinks? - I do. - Don't! - I have to. - You don't have to do anything. You know nothing about having to do something... Don't you give me that bullshit! All you care about is having your stuff, your restaurants, your manicures, your lingerie. When's he moving in? What does that have to do with anything? I'm leaving today. You told Emma the whole weekend. I'm being selfish, something you know all too well about. I can't find Poppy. Go look. I already did. Go pack, we're leaving. Why? What's that in your hand? Show it to me! Where did you get this photo? Where did you find this? Safiye gave it to me. Go pack. Go pack! Hi, Emma. Me and Safiye climbed a tree! Sofia? Who is Sofia? Mrs. Lewis? She's out, Mrs. Charlotte. Can I take a message? Ah! One ticket, please. Thank you. Anne? What are you doing here in the middle of the afternoon? I thought we were the only ones so decadent. Clearly we're not. Are you here to see A bout de souffle? Yes. Good! Finally working on your French! Listen, you've never met my Jeanne. Nice to meet you. Yes. How's Emma? She's good. She must be getting so tall. Yes. Fraser was so tall. It's funny, I just found this old piece that Fraser and I bought on one of our trips to Berlin. Anyways, he chose it. I hated it but you might like it. Or Owen or Emma... I forgot to put money in the meter, I should... Nice to meet you. Yes. Maybe we'll see you after the movie. Hi. Can I help you with something? Yes. I need chairs reupholstered. Let me see, do you want us to pick them up or are you going to have them delivered? You can pick them up. Okay. Safiye, samples please. Hi. Here are the samples. See you tomorrow. Goodnight. You do work late. Not tonight, I just had to pick something up. Who owns that? A church. We're refinishing all their pieces right now. Hearing you worked with furniture reminded me that I wanted to have my chairs reupholstered before the wedding so I thought I should come in as soon as I got back. Owen must be waiting for you. Here are the samples. It's hard to decide. I'm going to have a drink, do you want one? Might help. Do you like vodka? - Teo has one from Poland. - I don't drink. He says it's a must for all new customers. To a new customer. I'm sorry if I left without saying anything. I didn't want to drag Owen away. I wasn't feeling well. Are you pregnant? No. Are you sure? I would know. Not always. Where else have you been besides London and New York? All over Europe, South America, a little in Asia. Owen's father used to travel a lot. With friends. Did Owen tell you that? Yes. How did you meet him? I spilled a drink on him at a wedding. In exchange, he wined and dined me. When he proposed to me he gave me a necklace with these incredible pearls. I'd never seen anything like it. He was very charming. Like Charlotte. It must be genetic. She's very generous too. She gave me a bag of dresses she doesn't wear anymore. I feel like another one, do you want one? Sure. To... You. So she invited you over? Yes. So she must have served you tea. No. No? I had to leave. She didn't insist? Maybe a little. So she didn't have a chance to interrogate you? About what? Anything. No. What do you think of her house? It's gaudy. I would have thought that churches were broke and shutting down. This is a very beautiful one. I've never been to church. Have you? - To a service? - Yeah? Yeah. But I've visited a lot of them. I always say I'm going to go but whenever I try, I walk in and it's so quiet and cold and there are these faces staring down at me in stained glass. I always end up walking out. Where did you find that photograph? The one you gave Emma? On the floor. Where? In the living room. You look happy in it, very much in love. Owen didn't love his father much. Well, he wasn't around very much. But you stayed. I was used to being alone. I had a mother who was never home. Always out with some guy or another. When I moved into Fraser's house, there was barely a light on. He used to keep the house really cold. He would go on these long trips, I never really knew where or with who. The only one really around was Owen. He was nine years old when we got married. He was so skinny, he'd barely eat. He just stayed in his room all day and play piano. But at night when Fraser was away, lying in his bed at night, he would knock on the bedroom wall. After a while I realized that he was waiting for me to knock back. So I did. We'd do it until we both fell asleep. He didn't like any of his nannies. He wouldn't even let them in his room. He... He would've starved to death. So I stayed. I'm tired, I have to go. I have to order this piece. Here. It's for this car. It's all I got. Mrs. Lewis, one or two days. Anyways, you left some bags in here. I don't need them. Hello? Yeah. You can come by, those tires came in for you. You should be asleep. I wasn't tired. Hello? Can you talk or is he back? No, I can't talk. I need to see you. I can't, I'm busy. We need to talk. I'm busy until the wedding. Owen? Did you make room for David's things? Yes ma'am. But so much of Owen's things are in the basement room. Take them out. Call him and tell him to pick them up or we'll throw them out. Yes, ma'am. Safiye! What are you doing here? How's my wife-to-be? I have to get used to you having a key. How was the trip? It was good! Got a lot done. But I do have to go to a dinner meeting tonight, sorry. Me too, I'll be out. Phan took Emma off to Alison's. They waited up but they were going to be late. I forgot. Where were you? What? Where were you? I had errands to run. You couldn't answer your phone? You couldn't answer your cell all weekend? The site was a little bit far from cell coverage. My battery must be dead. You should charge it every night. Should I? I'm sorry. There's just so much to do. Welcome home. Just the bill, please. What are you doing here? You can't come here like this anymore. We need to talk. It's late. I'm tired. Let's go inside. Go home, Owen. Why, hmm? What is it? Is he back, is that it? Don't marry him. You're drunk. She's... she's gone. What? Safiye's left. I don't... I don't love her, Anne. Owen. Owen. Owen... What are you doing? Stop it! I want Emma to be made legally mine. I want the tests done and I want the papers. He didn't touch me for years. You know that she's yours. I want it on record before you get married, 'cause she's not going to become his! That wasn't the deal. I was too young then to make deals! She'll find out. If you do this Charlotte will find out and when she does... I'll tell her the same thing I told him that night, he's an asshole and I love you. I told you I'd tell him, I didn't care and I still don't. She won't touch you, Owen. Then we'll go away. This is crazy. Emma can't leave, this is were she belongs. I can't take her away from all of this. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. No, I can't, I can't. I can't! And I won't! It doesn't matter anyway. Charlotte will never allow us to do this. She'll make it impossible. I need a week before the wedding to get the paperwork done. No, Owen. I'll give you two days until I contact my lawyers, and then you can decide when Emma finds out. Owen, no. Owen... Owen, don't. Owen, no! What are you doing here? Where's Emma? I came here to see you. Do you care to explain why David has moved out? And why you've cancelled the wedding? You alluded to having financial problems. I don't see how. I've taken very good care of you, haven't I? Fraser made sure that I would. You cannot cancel a wedding two weeks before. It's just not done. The Neilsons will not be happy. And people are going to start asking why you decided all of a sudden to cancel. And I do not want to deal with it! I'm not ready. Not ready for what? Emma needs a father. She's fine. Only because I'm here to ensure that she is! That she gets the best of everything! A child is not meant to be raised by a woman alone with a maid. It looks absurd! He would always be away anyway! What... what difference does it make? Do you think my mother was not left alone to raise me and Fraser? That was 60 years ago. Things have changed. Nothing has changed! Anyone who tries to convince you that things have changed is either a fool or a nobody! Do you think I don't know? Do you think I didn't see what was going on between you and Owen? You and your dirty, disgusting, perverted mind. The three of you, living here in my family home. You will marry David, or rest assured Fraser's mysterious hit and run will have your name all over it and I don't care who did it! You will spend the rest of your days rotting in jail and you'll only see your love child on visiting days through tempered glass! Do I make myself clear? I'm having lunch with David at the Verve at noon. I think you should join us. I don't see how you could find a better father for Emma, and we need to think of Emma. Get yourself together, make yourself look your usual beautiful self. I can't do everything. Hello? Hey, hello, it's Steve. Yes. I just dropped your car off at your house, okay? Yes, I see it. Alright. Okay, bye. Thank you. I just thought I'd drop by. No one just stops by after 12 years. Do you still practice? No. What do you think of her? Best I've seen in a while. She reminds me of you. Same style. Doesn't want to fit in with the rest of the team, like you, too. Do you ever hear from the others? Now you care about the team? Sarah's married, got three kids. Josie is with an embassy in the Middle East somewhere. And Deb's coaching. I think she's divorced now. She asked about you the last time I saw her. I said I hadn't heard much since the tryouts, that you'd married some really rich guy after we didn't make the cut for Sydney. She was only asking to be polite. Yeah, right. Patrick! You have a granddaughter. I thought you didn't want any. What's her name? Emma. How old is she? Seven. Does she look like me? No. Can I meet her? No. Why are you here, Annie? I just... I don't... I want... You want to help, is that it? You pity your poor mom, finally? - No. - You want to spread your bucks around after all these years, after I worked like a horse to raise you on my own? To train you to be the best. You never helped anyone in your whole fucking life! I dreamt of this day for years. Now that it's here, I don't feel a thing. Go back up your mountain, Annie. I'm sure you're a better mom than I ever was. You can afford to be. Goodbye, Annie. Anne! Now run. And pray that I never catch you! Is everything okay, madam? What time is it? A little after six. I'm just leaving. Can I see your license and registration please? I was just leaving! Can I see your license and registration please? I was just leaving. What's in the bags? I'm an archer. A what? An archer. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Uh, is this your car? Yes. Who's Fraser Lewis? He bought the car for me but it's registered under my name. Okay, wait here. Okay, it's fine.
