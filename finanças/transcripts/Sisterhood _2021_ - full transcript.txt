I heard she came down with something. Stop talking or I’ll question you on the lesson. Sara? Maya! Where are you headed? Practice. Without me? I think Mars wants to get in my pants. But I know he won't make the first move. I plan to fuck him tonight. Jana. We have to tell someone. We have to see if she's home or not. Listen to me. If you say a single word to anyone, I'll say it was you who posted the video. Do you want people to find out? No, you don't. So keep your mouth shut! Okay? Guys, Elena's absent again. -I hear her parents want to move. -I'd move to another country too. I wouldn't be surprised if she's already gone. I heard she changed her look completely. Cut her hair and dyed it. Does it look good on her? If it were me, I'd leave this planet. As far away as possible. Maya! Come over here! Come on, come on! Stop hitting on my girl. Act normal. People will notice. …I called all her friends. Jana, I can't take it anymore. Are you there? Don't say anything. Don't do anything stupid. Okay? I have a plan. Stupid jerk. Give me your phone. Everyone's posting about it except us. Maybe someone has seen her. Please! Have you seen my Elena? Please tell me if you hear something. If anyone asks, we know nothing, okay? -What about the video? -Not a word. We were never involved. I bet she's killed herself. I bet. If I was a girl and it happened to me, I'd… Quiet! I'd jump off the top floor. I'd find something even higher. -Quiet over there! -Sorry. Jana, come in. -You know what to say. -Quiet. You said nothing, right? Like we agreed. Make a wish. -I have one. -Now pull. You win! That girl, was she from your school? The missing girl? Yes. -It's horrifying. -What are you talking about? Nothing, dear. I saw her mother at the bus stop today. Poor woman. I can't imagine what it must be like. Jana SMS: Where are you? Pick up! Seat, Axel. There's Jana and Monika. -Hello. -Hi. Come here. Why didn't you text back? What do you mean? Don't act dumb. I tried to reach you all day. -Hi. -Good evening. Let's get going. Elena! Elena! Elena! Elena! Elena! How can we help? I want to report… What? Report what? Tell me. A stolen phone. You'll have to wait. We have more urgent things to do. Fuck. You're such a coward. Stop filming! Monika! Monika is a pussy. Pussy. Pussy! Stop it! OMG! Yes Queen! We're the cutest. -I heard a rumor about Maya. -What rumor? Her parents split up and her dad left. Old news. You know what I heard? He got another woman pregnant. -Are you kidding? -I know, right? -OMG. So sad. -Juicy. You know what I heard? Kris told me Maya didn't put out. This is the gravitational pull of the earth. This force is simply… Maya, Jana. Stop it. It's Monika, sir. I don't care. Sorry. The bodies we encounter have a negligibly small mass… Who posted this photo? Holy Virgin -He asked you out? -OMG -Didn't he use to date Daria? -He dumped her. Martina! Look at what you've done. You're a mess! -Please never do this again, okay? -Okay. -Come in, Jana. -Hello, Mrs. Iskra. She'll be down in a moment. Haven't seen you in a while. -How are you? -I'm busy with school. Lots of homework. -How about a snack? -I'm not hungry. -You sure? -Yes. I have something for you. It's good you came. I've been working on it for a while. -It's really nice. -You like it? Turn around. The mirror's over there. The color suits you well, I think. I can't wait to wear it. Maya didn't really like it. Maya, dear. It looks good on her, right? Sure. Everything okay? Smile. Have you said anything? No. There's a party tonight, if you want to come. I won't. I knew I shouldn't have come. I only came because your mom begged me. Thank you. Come on, Axel. He keeps running away. Get in, boy. Did you tell her? If you do… I'll kill you! What a party. Why didn't you come? I didn't see your post. I even wrote in the group chat. Next time. Hurry up! You spend more time out of the pool than in it. Have you lost your mind?
