[ pen scratching on paper ] - When I was 29, I decided to kill my mother. [ sighs ] When I was 29, I decided to kill my mother. [ pen scratching on paper ] - But don'’t believe everything you'’re told. It isn'’t always the truth. Give me the fairy story any day. Once upon a time, a baby boy was abandoned in a forest. [ brakes squealing ] - An eagle had snatched him from his mother'’s arms and dropped him on a tree far away from home. But as luck would have it, he was found by a kindly woodcutter, who named him Fir Apple. The woodcutter took Fir Apple home, to be a playmate for his daughter, Lizzy. Never were two children so happy. But the woodcutter'’s evil old cook was jealous of Fir Apple and plotted to kill him. Over time, Lizzy sensed her malice. And one night whispered to the boy, "“If you never leave me, I'’ll never leave you."” Fir Apple replied, "“Not now, Nor ever." And the two escaped into the night. The evil cook chased them far and wide, but Lizzy and Fir Apple disguised themselves as a flower on a rose bush, as a duck on a lake. Finally, the cook catches up with them, and starts to drink the lake dry. [ duck quacks ] But the ducks bites her with his beak, and the water drags her down, down into the lake, drowning her. And Lizzy and Fir Apple live safe forevermore. I'’ll never leave you, not now, nor ever. [ chattering ] - And guess what was inside? Three big bowls of porridge. Try the first one, and it was yucky. Too sweet. And then she tried the next bowl, and it was too salty... [ seagulls crying ] [ child laughing ] [ chattering ] - Can I used your toilet, please? - Can, if you buy a drink. - I don'’t drink. I'’ve got my period. - Go on. - Thanks. - Excuse me. How far is Tigh-Na-Beane from here, please? - It'’s "Tie-na-Bane". - Can I get there on foot? - You can get anywhere on the island if you walk for long enough. - Or swim. [ laughs ] - Just turn left and keep on going. You'’ll find it. - Hello? Is that Mrs. Lovich? Hello? I called up about the room. [ gate creaks ] - Mrs. Lovich? Phyllis Lovich? - Yes. - I'’m Nikki Black. We just spoke on the phone. I'’m doing the geography project. - Come in. Do you want room for your books? - If you don'’t mind. - I'’ll get my son to move those things for you. - Your son? - Yes. Calum. I'’ll get him to move them for you. [ sniffles ] - A brother? Fucking hell. [ knocking ] - Oi. - Can I help you? - Hi. I'’m Calum. Mother told me to show you around outside. - It'’s treasure. - What? - Treasure from the sea. - So, where'’s your dad? Calum? What do you do? For work? Must do something. What about all that treasure? You sell it? - Sell it? The sea brought it here alive. I keep it. - Of course you do. - Mother doesn'’t like it. Too much treasure, Calum. - What about your father? What does he think? - Want to see where I live? [ bottles clattering ] - What are these? - Footwear. 36 pairs. The rest are odd. - You'’re right there. What the fuck are you doing? - Pretty. - Don'’t touch me. - Sorry. - I'’m sorry, Nikki. I didn'’t mean to. But it is very pretty. - You'’re like a magpie. - This is prayer ground. Elders came here for prayers before they built the church. - Here? It'’s a bit fucking bleak, isn'’t it? - Out there was a monastery. But you can'’t get on or off it. Except at high tide. That'’s why the monks built it there. - What'’s that got to do with the islanders? - They came to hear mass. - It'’s half a mile away. There'’s no way they'd ever be able to hear each other. I'’m going to head back, now. Thanks for the history lesson. [ clock ticking ] - What is it? - I wondered where I could get supplies. Milk and stuff. Is there a farm? - Farm? You can get everything you need from the post office where you saw my card. - What about fish? Does your husband-- - Like I said, you can get everything you need from the post office. - Thank you. Witch. [ wind howling ] [ footsteps ] - Don'’t forget to mend the fences down on the Colloran side today. Creatures keep getting caught in the wire. And be extra careful with the cutters. Gerry sharpened them last week. [ door opens and closes ] - Late riser. - Eat up. - Is this all yours? - Yeah, thank you. - Did you find Tigh-na-Baene? - Yes, thanks. - And are you long staying on the island? - I'’m doing a human geography project. Background research. - Tell me, how are you finding it up there? All right? - I only got here yesterday. Why do you ask? - Oh, no reason, really. It'’s just, well, some people think she'’s a bit standoffish. - Is there a man about? - There was. Angus McLoud. Of course, she didn'’t change her name when they got married. - What happened to him? - The poor man, he didn'’t stand a chance. - He'’s dead? - Not just dead. And you telling me the best sailor on the island drowned? Huh. - Nikki? Hello? [ birds squawking ] - Fuck! Great. - Nikki! - Oh, I don'’t believe it. - Are you okay down there? - What do you think? - I don'’t think you'’re okay down there. - Fuck. Why have you brought me here? - Special place. ♪ The Blue Men are beast high with foam gray faces ♪ When billows toss, oh, who would cross ♪ The Blue Man'’s Kyles [ chuckles ] - Sea killed my father. - When? - Seven years ago. - Tell me about him. When did he meet Phyllis? - Oh look, look. - What is it? - Seals. Look. Do you know the story of Seal girls? Do you want some tea? - No, and no. - Family of crofters were thrown out by their chief. So they went in their boat up the kyle. There. - Got it. - There was a storm. And they overturned. Capsized right there by Seal Rock. - Is that it? - They all drowned. Except for the baby. She was taken up by the seals. She sucked milk from the mother. The other pups taught her to swim and bark instead of talk. Men tried to catch her, but no one could. - What happened to her? - Well, she'’s still out there. [ chattering ] - Crush them really hard. - Can I help? I love laundry. When I was little, I always thought fresh laundry was what sunshine smelled of. So that even at night, it'’d still be day. [ child screaming ] - I wondered if you could help me, Mrs. Lovich. I need some information on the island for my project. [ exhales heavily ] - Are you okay? - I get a pain. I'’m all right. [ grunts ] - Should I help you inside? [ sighs ] - Please, could you bring me my medicine? It'’s above the sink in the kitchen. Brown, no label. - Are you sure you don'’t want me to call the doctor? - This will be fine, thank you. Ugh. Were you going out? I don'’t want to keep you. - I'’m not in a hurry. - About your project. Calum would be able to tell you as much as anyone about the island. - He was born here? - 24 years ago. Oh. I can'’t believe how long ago that sounds. How time flies. - Does it? - Angus, his father, taught him more all the hearths and hidey-holes as a child. - Is that him? - Mm-hmm. - I heard he died. I'’m sorry. - He filled Calum'’s head with all the ancient stories of Vikings and myths and Clearances. - Yeah, he told me some of them already. - Hmm. He lives in a dream half the time. - That'’s not such a bad thing, Mrs. Lovich. What about yourself? What brings someone like you to the island? - I'’d been living in Italy. - Is your family from there? - No. No. I had no contact with them. - Why not? - Fell pregnant. With Calum. - So? - I hadn'’t married Angus yet. They didn'’t approve. - Seems a bit extreme in this day and age. - I'’d been pregnant before. A daughter. Susan. She died. [ gate squeaks ] [ gasps ] - Hello? Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear me? [ crying ] - Nikki! Nikki! [ shouting ] [ door closes ] - Calum! I'’ve been going out of mind. Where have you been? - At the net. - The net? What were you doing there? - Calum. Answer me. - I can go there. I'’m allowed anywhere on the island, you said. - Not in this weather. I'’ve told you a thousand times. From now on, you tell me where you'’re going every time, or I won'’t let you out again. [ shivering ] - Calum. Come and help me with this. - I was just out walking and bumped into Calum, which was lucky. I would never have been able to find my way back by myself. I'’m not used to how fast the fog comes in. - You were supposed to be going to Moody'’s for some eggs. - I was going to go to Moody'’s. - From the other side of the island? I don'’t understand you, Calum. It'’s not safe. Especially on a night like tonight. [ wind howling ] - I could have told you the fog was coming in. - You knew the fog was coming? - You'’re staying in the spare room tonight. No argument. [ birds twittering ] [ clanging ] [ sniffs ] - Happy birthday! [ chattering ] [ chattering ] - Or someone. Fuck off. [ laughter ] - Picture time. Smile. [ crying ] [ phone rings ] [ phone continues to ring ] - Calum. Calum! - What'’s exactly wrong with her, Calum? - Cancer. - That'’s medicine she'’s always making. - Do you know what these are? - No, Calum. - They'’re houses. The little people live here. Nikki? - Yes. - Do you know who the little people are? - I don'’t believe in fairies. - You shouldn'’t say that. - Why not? - Can'’t keep sheep here because the little people drive them mad. They run in circles, around and around. Until they die. They were Lucifer'’s angels. When he left heaven they had to leave, too. Some of them fell in the sea. The Blue Men, the ones I told you about drowning my family. - And? Some fell in the sea. And? - Others fell on land. Things is, they play all sorts of tricks and deceptions. Sometimes calm, but always plotting. - What kinds of tricks? - Like, sucking the insides out of stuff, but leaving the outside looking exactly the same. - Explain. - Like a feast. A table full of cakes. Looks delicious on the surface, but crumbles to dust when you touch it. They can do the same thing, hey. With gold. And houses and castles. Like brown berries. Flesh, good for you. Seeds are poison. - Can they do it to people? Suck the insides out and... - Some say... they'’ve done it to the whole world already. Do you want to see inside? - Okay. Where'’s that piece of mother of pearl you found earlier? - Do you want it? Because I'’ll let you have it, Nikki, if you want it. - Oh, no, thank you, Calum. I was just checking. I like your room. It'’s your own. Must be nice. - She'’s not allowed in here. - Last night, when I got lost in the fog, why was Mrs. Lovich so angry with you? - She gets cross around dusk time. - Why? - I used to live in your room. - And? - I wanted to leave. It... It was this exact time last year. On her birthday. - Phyllis'’ birthday? - No. My sister'’s. - Why did you want to leave, Calum? - I knew she'’d try to stop me, so, I didn'’t tell her I was going. - And? - Tried to kill herself. - Why? [ water pouring ] - She didn'’t want me to go. She was crying. - She'’s going to die anyway, right? [ wind howling ] - Hello? [ exhales ] [ door opens ] [ pants ] [ child screaming ] - I'’d been pregnant before. Before. A daughter. - Smile. - Fuck off. - I don'’t want to keep you. She died. A daughter. She died. [ heavy breathing ] - I heard something. Calum. What are you cooking there? - Steak and kidney pie. - Do you make his dinner every day? - He'’d live on bread and cheese otherwise. - Is he okay? - Yes, thank you. - I mean, he doesn'’t-- - He'’s absolutely fine. - Can'’t he get a job? - There'’s not a lot of work on the island. - I'’m sorry, but there seems like there'’s plenty of work fishing. Why doesn'’t he fish, Mrs. Lovich? - I'’m sorry, what? - Why doesn'’t Calum fish like everyone else? - He does fish. - Not from a boat. You won'’t let him. He told me. We talk all the time. - As I said, he'’s different. - Scared he'’s sail away and never come back. - He has his food cooked for him. And the run of the place. He can come and go as he pleases. - Well, that'’s little more than you give a dog, isn'’t it? Do you want anything from the post office? Hello? Hello? Calum? Calum? Calum! Calum. I'’ve been thinking about you stuck here. - Don'’t mind. - But you wanted to leave. Remember? - That was different-- - Have you ever been to the mainland? - Once. Once I went with mother. - Your father never took you? What a shame. I'’m sure he would have wanted you to go. Why don'’t we go? Together. - To the mainland? When? - Whenever we like. - I don'’t know. - There'’s a wide world out there, Calum. It'’s full of treasure. - What about my mother? - What about her? Wouldn'’t you like to see where I come from? - Where are you from? - Nowhere. All over. I'’m from all over. - I'’m not sure. - Have I ever told you the story of Fir Apple? Once upon a time, a baby boy was abandoned in a forest. An eagle snatched him from his mother'’s arms, and dropped him on a tree far away from home. Ever feel like you'’re flying? Are they cormorants? They look like cormorants. I love saying that word. - You know the story of Table Rock? - Did you consider my proposition yesterday? - I liked Fir Apple. - That was a story, Calum. What about the mainland? Okay. Let'’s hear your story first. Table Rock, was it? - A long time ago, there lived a fisherman and his wife. They lived in a little cottage above the cliffs. Like that one. There'’s lots of abandoned villages around the island, Nikki. After the clearances. - Just keep to the story, Calum. - Okay. One day, the fisherman went out on his boat. His wife felt ill. She had a baby in her belly, and it was time for it to be born. She went down to the beach to have the baby and then she carried it across the shingle and laid it on Table Rock. You can walk out to it at low tide, you see, but at high tide, it looks like it floats on the water. Like a raft. - Why would she abandon her ba-- - Didn'’t belong to her husband. She walked slowly back up to her cottage and made her husband'’s tea. And after their supper, he went down to spread his nets. He hears a mewing. Is it the cormorants? Is it a bleating calf? Or maybe the wind moaning over the rocks? Then he spots the little naked child on Table Rock. He reaches out and gathers up the baby and carries it back to his wife. Look, wife, a gift from the sea. We must look after her as if she were our own. And the woman takes her and puts her to the breast. - Is that the end? Maybe that'’s not how it goes. Maybe the husband is stupid and dangerous. Maybe he beats his wife. Treats her as his slave. Maybe the real father, the lover, who promised to take her away from it all, is dead. Drowned. - Nikki. - She leaves the child on Table Rock because she can'’t bear to kill it. She thinks, when the tide comes, the waves will carry it away to its real father. The man she truly loved. She managed to conceal her morning sickness, but she'’s forgotten that Table Rock isn'’t covered at high tide. So when she sees her husband wading across, she sits here and prays. She doesn'’t allow herself to hope. She doesn'’t allow herself to hope. He can'’t imagine that she could have been unfaithful or that any other man could desire her. Doesn'’t enter his head that the child is hers. It'’s his, by right of finding. And she, as his slave, will tend to it. So she takes it from him without a word, and bows her head to hide her grateful tears. - Who told you that? - No one. I made it up. Why don'’t you come away with me, Calum? - I really like you, Nikki. - I know. This isn'’t right, Calum. Calum. Calum. [ grunts ] Calum. - Oi! - She'’s ill! [ singing ] [ chattering ] - Nikki. - Oh. Look. Are we interrupting? - Oh. [ laughter ] - What'’s in that? - Treasure. - Ooh, treasure. - Want to see? - All right. - Go on, then. - Let'’s have a look, lads. - Is it--is it precious? - Yes. - Let me ask my mates. What is this crap? - Calum, let'’s go. - [ laughter ] - Give us a chance, we only just got here. - What did you do that for? - This place is a shithole. - It'’s not a shithole. It'’s not a shithole. - Calum, ignore them. They'’re just a bunch fuckwits. - What are you, love, his fucking girlfriend? - Lucky for you I don'’t hit girls. - Come on. - All right, good, because this place is a fucking dump. [ grunting ] - Oh, shit! - Get off him! [ grunting ] - Get off him! Leave him alone! - Nikki. Nikki. Nikki! [ footsteps ] [ chair scrapes ] - Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Hurt face. - I hope you'’re fucking jealous, Phyllis. [ coughs ] [ grunts ] - I wanted to have a word with you about the room. - My room? - Yes. I'’m going to be needing it, so I'’d like you to find somewhere else. - Needing it for what? - I'’m giving you notice. - Why? - I don'’t think I need to answer that question. - Is there something wrong? What have I done? - It'’s-- It'’s unsettling for Calum to have someone in his old room. - Why? - You saw what can happen. He'’s distraught over the incident with-- - He'’s distraught? - I'’d be grateful if you'd leave him alone from now on. - But he enjoys talking to me. - Please, Miss Black. I expect you to leave by the end of week. [ glass breaks ] - I'’m leaving tomorrow. - What? Why? - I have to go. Project'’s nearly finished. - You can stay here. - No, I can'’t. - Is it what happened? - No. Because your mother wants me to leave. - Was mother in the house? - Well, she doesn'’t want me here. Did you tell her what happened? - No. She never asks me what I want. She--she treats me like I'’m stupid. - I know. - It'’s not fair. She'’s not fair. I'’ll come with you. Show her. - Right. I'’ve got it all planned. We'’ll take the morning ferry before she'’s even woken up. - Right. - We won'’t tell her. We'’ll just go. [ seal barks ] - Calum. Come on. Come on. Ready? - Yes. I'’m telling her we're going. - Calum, why? Come with me. Either way, I'’m going on the ferry. - What are you doing? No, it'’s-- [ yelling ] - Woo! Look, look at the thing! Where is it? Where'’s the boat? - It'’s not going. - But it has to go. - Storm'’s coming. - Everyone will be stranded. - It'’s okay. Sometimes it can'’t go for days. - What? No. You could swim that, for fuck'’s sake. I do not believe it. - Why? - You don'’t understand. The weather was with us. It was saying yes, you can do it. You shall go to the ball. It wasn'’t telling us to go back to the old witch'’s house and listen to fucking weather forecasts. You know someone we could borrow a boat from? Calum? [ laughs ] Calum. We'’ll be there in no time. Whose boat is this anyway? - Gerry. - I thought you weren'’t allowed in boats. - He was a friend of my dad'’s. - You sly old salty sea dog. - Whoa. - Whoa there, sailor. [ laughs ] - Aren'’t you going to start the engine? - Don'’t know how. - Let me have a go. You come over and do some oaring. All right? - Okay. [ engine turns over ] - Thank you, thank you very much. [ laughs ] - I'’m doing this for you, Calum. For us. Isn'’t this great? [ laughs ] [ thunder ] - Leave it, Calum. Just leave it. We'’re on our way. We'’re flying. [ engine roars ] [ laughs ] - Nikki! - I can'’t hear you. - I can'’t swim. Whoa! I sorry, Nikki, I can'’t grab it! It'’s gone. The book, everything. - Leave it, Calum. It doesn'’t matter. We'’ve got to keep going. Fuck! Bail out the boat. Bail it out! Where'’s the light? Fuck! She can'’t do this to us! - Nikki, no! [ water splashing ] [ gasping ] - Calum. Calum! Don'’t leave me! Don'’t leave me. Calum! [ gasping ] [ door closes ] - Calum? - No, me. - Where'’s Calum? Did he leave? - And go where, exactly? He couldn'’t get very far in that storm. But you know all about that. - I don'’t know what you mean. - You just tried to drown me. Sounds stupid, I know. Where do you think you'’re going? - I have to get Calum. - No, you'’re not. And in the future, if you'’re going to call up a storm, you better make sure you know who'’s in it, because we both nearly died. Those magical powers always backfire, don'’t they? - What do you want? - I want you to admit it. - I don'’t know what you'’re talking about. - You don'’t give up, do you? I have the birth certificate. All the paperwork. I am Susan Lovich. Your daughter. Born 2nd October, 1980. Wrapped in a white towel, left on the steps of Camden Post Office. Found by a cleaner at 6:30 A.M. and taken to hospital. Brought up in care and foster homes, and pathologically unstable ever since. Not to mention fucking angry. - What do you want? Money? - Well, now, money would be nice. But first of all, I want to know why-- - Whoever told you this should have told you that Susan died. [ door opens ] - I'’m not dead. I'’ve been living for 29 years. - Susan died when she was 10 months old. - You'’re not listening to me. Okay, what did she die of? - I don'’t know. - You don'’t know. You don'’t know what your own daughter died of. - Get out. - What-- - Get out! - No. Why don'’t you know what your daughter died of? - I wasn'’t there, I was in Italy. I told you. - So how do you know she died? - My mother. My mother told me. This is none of your business. - None of my business? It'’s the only business I'’ve ever had. [ sobbing ] Why did you leave me? - It won'’t make it any better. - Please. - Susan'’s father was my brother. Calum. [ shouts ] [ sobbing ] - What have we done? Oh, God. - I just--I just got so angry with her. - Shh. - I didn'’t mean to. - I know, I know. - I just didn'’t want you to go. - I know. - Is it true? - What? - That you are Susan? - Yeah. - She never said. She never-- - I know. She never. - I won'’t go. You can'’t make me. - We'’ll tell them a story, okay? That it was my fault. I did it. - That'’s not the truth. - Listen. It'’s truer than the truth. Tell them where you found me. - In the sea. - Okay. That'’s what you tell them. You saw me walking into the sea because our mother hurt me. And I killed her. - They'’ll take you away. - But you can stay here. And one day, I'’ll come back. - If you never leave me, I'’ll never leave you. - Not now, nor ever.
