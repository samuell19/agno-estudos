Okay. Mr Lo, Serg Shih's up above. Sergeant. Sergeant. Sergeant. Shen Kun. Shen Kun. What happened? I Don't know! Andy, you? Believe it or not, he'd died before I came. How did you get in? Through the front door! Front door? Did you see him? No. That man this morning was not him. He never came in from day tonight. You... Sorry, Andy, you're under arrested. Stop! Sister! - Andy - Thank you. Are you okay? I'm alright. Don't worry. How did my brother die? That was a trap. He'd died when I arrived. Killed by a gun in hand, Karov must've done. Karov? Yes, don't stay in my home anymore. You'll be their next target. Have you informed the people I told you to? Yes, all of them. Watch out for them. Buddy, what a small world! So what? After I came in, there are more friends. Much more than before. I thought I couldn't take vengeance. But your day has approached. You can't take vengeance today anyway. You claimed to use violence. Let me go! What are you doing? Mr Lo, your sister gave us a message. I've prepared over 200 men. No need! Tell them to have mercy. Listen, everybody. Last fight for an hour or so. Okay. Okay. I'm hungry. See if there's anything to eat. Forget it, all remnants. Youngster, don't block my sight. What are you doing? Trying to steal? Help yourselves! Help yourselves! I won't serve you. What are you doing? Go into hiding at once! What now? The jade. Let me point at him & he'll have strength. Pan-Chuang-chiu, come here! Come here quick! Just a chicken. He's passed out. What now? Why can't he see us? I use electric wave caused their brain nerve. to lose sight of us. Stop speaking. It may weaken my electric wave. Good Kung Fu! Good swordplay. Foreigner, did you kill my brother? Yes! Make believe I killed him. I'll beat you to a frazzle. Woman can only cope with her husband. Your brother is not my match. Is that so? What kind of a blow is this? This to cope with my tomcatting husband. It's true that a ruffian's afraid of a shrew. Sorry, I specialize in fixing shrew. Go over to the jade. I'm now gifted with ESP. As I said, a woman can only cope with her husband. depends on what kind of a woman. Interpol agent, Cindy Morgan. Your English is as rubbish as your Mandarin. Painful? Oh! That's it. Mammy. Don't move! I like children. But I'll kill him. Put the child down! Put the child down! Mammy! Mammy! Cover the jade. Mammy... Run! Mammy! Pin-pin! What now? Go and help Pin-pin. Pin-pin has been captured. If anything happens to him. I'll have you responsible. We will, but we won't free you anyway. I don't care, I must go out. Andy, don't act on impulse. Mr. Karov. How's it? They won't free Andy. Force him to say. I won't let him live. Understand. Yes. Boss, according to our research, this jade is harder even than a diamond & can't be cut. A test of it with an instrument gets no reaction. I suspect it has an aura of mystery. Yesterday I was nearly controlled by it. Luckily, I was strong-willed. What shall we do now? Child, you can use it, show me. What a shame. We're not evil. We brought you here for the welfare of mankind. If we know the energy origin of this jade. That will be the greatest discovery in history. Tell me now! Well, speak up! No, I've nothing to gain. What do you want? Let me bite your finger. Okay! You're nice, I won't bite now. Never mind, come on! I'll bite it lightly. Tell me now. I didn't promise to tell you. Okay, listen carefully. If you're nice, I'll buy you ice-cream. Otherwise, you'll get nothing. Jade, Jade, they've all left. Wake up and talk to me! What happened? Take him to the ward at once! Quick! Lao Ta, come on! Come on... I'll help you! I told you not to go against me. Buddy, now only one finger left. I'll separate it for you. Get in! Why did you free me through jailbreak. To throw the police spies off the guard. And I know the location of Karov's headquarters. I'm afraid they may move away. So we can't use police personnel. Superior wants you to take immediately. Quick! Now we'll divide into 2 groups. one to go down from 2nd floor... other to go up from ground floor. How are we to form? Palm, back. You in one group, go up from downstairs. You're lucky. They may come tonight. Watch out. Yes, sir. Little friend, little friend. Good friend. Why didn't you care for me till now. When I reacted, they might use laser. to dissect me, so I couldn't react. Why are you speaking to me then. Someone's here to save you. Don't be scared now. I'm damn scared. Let's change his dress. Okay. They're coming. Watch out! Let's scatter to cope with them. Beat him. Who are you? I'm a newcomer. A goodie or a baddie? A goodie. We're baddies. Andy. Why are you coming to hell here Are you fed up with life? Hand over Pin-pin. He's fled, we're after him. Andy, it's more important to find Pin-pin. Why didn't you tell that foreigner to free us. I can't control his brain wave for he's too strong. He's dirty in thinking? Friend, where do you come from? A faraway place, several million, light years from your planet. Is it as far as Africa? You'll understand when you grow up. After we leave, help me do one thing. What is it? Keep it a secret from anybody. Okay. Pin pin. Mammy, Uncle. Pin Pin. Mammy. Pin Pin, are you alright? How are you? Mammy, I'm tired. Sister, take him home for a rest. No, your home is dangerous, keep him in the police station. Pin Pin. Why do you let him hold that rock? Pale, look. The glue from the rock is sticking his body. It seems an operation is the only resolution. How strange. What devil is this? Sister, don't worry, there's a way. We go out for a talk. Yes. You watch. Yes. Listen, I'm taking this child out. Sister. Yes? Sister, give me an air ticket for Greece. Little friend, where's your mammy? Give us air tickets for Greece. Okay. It's okay. Thank you. That child's in Greece, & it's been confirmed. Must have to do with that jade. What then? I'm going to Greece too. Athena, I'm back. Please bless me with the return of the jade. Thank you! How about it? They can't find Pin Pin on the plane. Impossible. Not impossible, if the jade has magic power. My nose touched it & I have super power. Stop lying! Andy, you need imagination to be a cop. When so many say it, there's a possible. Hello! Yes! I'm Cindy Morgan. Okay, thank you. An hour ago, a child took a boat to an island. The jade, why are we going to the island? I must return to my real home. Little friend, we meet again. Over there. Where's the entrance? On your right-hand side is a cave. Let him go! Ask the jade where it's taking to? Jade, where are you taking us to? Karov! Uncle! Uncle! Andy. Pin Pin. What happened? They've dropped down. They may get killed! What now? Andy, go down and pursue Karov. Andy is not his peer. Calm down! Watch out! Luckily, I'm nimble. Oh, my goodness! Are you alright? Are you alright? Yes. They've taken Pin Pin up there, After them. Okay. What now? Look! This light shows there must be another outlet. Let's look everywhere. There 3 signs may control those doors. But which controls which? The dart... Wave... Skeleton... Which symbolizes the outlet. Easy! Boss. Skeleton signals danger, wave, safe. The dart, the outlet. Come here! What's it? Help me... Magnetic wall. Let me try. Something wrong with this tunnel. Let me go first. Be careful. Follow where the light. What kind of a monster? They seem to be dead. I'm now speaking to you with brain wave. People of any nationality can understand. I'm an explorer from the Milky World. 2000 years ago, earth time my spacecraft. was damaged & I had to form a base here. They all took me for God. I made a perfect earth woman for them. and they called her Venus. Venus? Oh, my goodness! I successfully quick-froze myself, change to light & had it reshipped to the planet. I got wounded & paralyzed in an accident. To find a Greek put the jade into the modulation. The jade is a combination of my computer and my pets. It is a computer with thinking. and the key to motive force. Whenever you hear this tape. it's an alarm that someone has cheated me. taken away the computer. but the computer when coming upon someday. with a suitable brain wave will return. I see. I've got this man from outer space. Little friend, thank you. Karov, put him down! What a shame if I've to obey you? Don't Move! Thank you, everybody. The achievement. for my country will make me a leader. To show my appreciation. I'll gladly send them to Heaven. Eagle Claw? Why are his metal weapons not magnetic. I don't know. Surprised? Luckily, they're made of special alloy. It's absolutely not magnetic. It's a proud product of our country. Come on, try. Watch out. Let's go and take him. Climb over. Pin Pin! Pin Pin! Don't be afraid. Step on the crevice, not the rock. Pin Pin! Pin Pin! Catch! Pin Pin. Pin Pin. Pin Pin, put me into the modulation. Jade, you're back. I can now return. Thank you, everybody. I'm on my way home. Good luck, everybody. No! No! Where's that foreigner? Gone with the ultra-man to space. Space? Jade, how are you? Answer me! Jade. Goodbye, little friend.
