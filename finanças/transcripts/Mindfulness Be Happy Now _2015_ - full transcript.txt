♪♪ [ BELL TOLLS ] - WHEN YOU DRINK YOUR TEA, YOU MAY LIKE TO BRING YOUR MIND BACK TO YOUR BODY SO THAT YOU'LL BE, UH, COMPLETELY THERE, ESTABLISHED IN THE PRESENT MOMENT. AND WHEN YOU DRINK LIKE THAT, YOU DRINK NOT ONLY WITH YOUR BODY, BUT YOU DRINK, ALSO, WITH YOUR MIND. UH, YOU DRINK THE TEA AND YOU ARE AWARE THAT YOU ARE DRINKING THE TEA. THAT IS MINDFULNESS OF DRINKING. YOU SEE? AND WHEN YOU DRINK YOUR TEA WITH MINDFULNESS, YOU ARE REALLY THERE AND THE TEA IS REALLY THERE AND THAT... IN THAT MOMENT, IS TRUE LIFE. WHEN YOUR MIND IS ELSEWHERE, WHEN YOU ARE NOT ENTIRELY WITH YOUR TEA, YOU ARE NOT THERE ALSO. SO THAT ACT OF DRINKING TEA IS NOT LIFE. IT'S, UH, YOU BEHAVE... UH, YOU OPERATE LIKE, UM, A ROBOT, A MACHINE. UH, THE MIND IS NOT THERE. MINDFUL MEANS YOU ARE FULL OF MIND. SO WHEN YOU BREATH IN AND IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE BREATHING IN, THAT IS MINDFUL BREATHING. AND WHEN YOU BREATH MINDFULLY, YOUR MIND IS BACK TO YOUR BODY. MIND, BODY TOGETHER... YOU ARE TRULY THERE IN THE HERE AND THE NOW. YOU ARE FULLY ALIVE. YOU ARE FULLY PRESENT. SO MINDFULNESS MAKE YOU FULLY ALIVE, FULLY PRESENT. MINDFULNESS IS THE KIND OF ENERGY THAT ALLOW YOU TO BE IN THE HERE AND THE NOW SO THAT YOU CAN GET IN TOUCH WITH LIFE, WITH THE WONDERS OF LIFE THAT ARE IN YOU AND AROUND YOU. AND IF YOU CAN GET IN TOUCH WITH THESE WONDERS OF LIFE THAT ARE, UM, REFRESHING, HEALING, NOURISHING... AND YOU GET THE NOURISHMENT FROM THAT. YOU GET THE HEALING, UM, THAT YOU NEED. SO MINDFULNESS, UH, FIRST OF ALL, IS, UH, THE CAPACITY TO BE TRULY THERE IN THE HERE AND THE NOW, IN ORDER FOR YOU TO GET IN TOUCH WITH THE WONDERS OF LIFE SO THAT YOU CAN TRULY LIVE YOUR LIFE. AND WHEN YOU GO BACK TO YOURSELF, YOU MIGHT ENCOUNTER SOMETHING THAT IS, UH, NEGATIVE, LIKE, UH, YOUR SORROW, YOUR FEAR, YOUR ANGER. AND MINDFULNESS HELP YOU TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR FEAR, YOUR ANGER. UH, THE ENERGY OF MINDFULNESS, UH, UH, MAY HELP YOU TO RECOGNIZE THE PRESENCE OF YOUR FEAR, YOUR ANGER, YOUR DEPRESSION. UH, THE ENERGY OF MINDFULNESS, UH, GENERATED BY YOUR MINDFUL BREATHING CAN HELP YOU TO, UH, EMBRACE, TENDERLY, THE FEAR, THE SORROW THAT IS IN YOU SO THAT YOU MAY GET THAT RELIEF. SO MINDFULNESS, UH, CAN ALSO HELP YOU TO TAKE CARE, UH, OF, UH, YOURSELF. AND WHEN YOU NEED TO, UH, TAKE CARE... AND WHEN YOU GO BACK TO YOURSELF, AND IF YOU ENCOUNTER THE POSITIVE, UH, THINGS... AND THEN YOU CAN BE NOURISHED AND, UH, HEALED BY THESE POSITIVE THINGS. WHEN MINDFULNESS BRING YOUR MIND BACK TO YOUR BODY, AND IF YOU ENCOUNTER SOME, UH, TENSIONS, SOME, UH, PAIN, SOME SORROW... AND THEN MINDFULNESS WILL HELP RECOGNIZE, EMBRACE TENDERLY THESE EMOTIONS, THESE FEELINGS, UH, THIS PAIN SO THAT YOU WILL SUFFER LESS. AND MINDFULNESS, UH, IF YOU PRACTICE, UM, REGULARLY IT WILL BE STRONGER EVERY DAY, AND YOU'LL BRING, UM, MORE CONCENTRATION. AND WITH MINDFULNESS AND CONCENTRATION, YOU CAN, UH, LOOK DEEPLY AT, UH, WHAT IS THERE AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND, UH, DEEPLY THE NATURE OF WHAT IS THERE... UH, MAYBE, UH, YOUR ANGER, YOUR FEAR. IF YOU KNOW HOW TO LOOK DEEPLY INTO THE NATURE OF YOUR FEAR, YOUR ANGER, YOU WILL GET THE INSIGHT INTO THEIR NATURE. AND THAT KIND OF INSIGHT WILL LIBERATE YOU FROM... FROM, UM, YOUR FEAR, YOUR ANGER. SO MINDFULNESS BRING CONCENTRATION. AND MINDFULNESS AND CONCENTRATION BRING INSIGHT THAT IS LIBERATING. - MINDFULNESS IS CONSCIOUS, UM, CURIOUS, UNATTACHED, NONJUDGMENTAL AWARENESS. AND IT COULD BE AWARENESS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD. IT COULD BE AWARENESS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN YOUR BODY. IT COULD BE AWARENESS OF YOUR THOUGHTS. IT COULD BE AWARENESS OF IMAGES AND CONSCIOUSNESS. IT COULD BE AWARENESS OF EMOTIONS. SO WHEN YOU OBSERVE WITHOUT JUDGMENT, THAT'S MINDFULNESS. AND IT'S VERY PROFOUND. IT'S THE HIGHEST FORM OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE IN THE MERE OBSERVING OF YOURSELF... BECAUSE, IN A SENSE, YOU'RE OBSERVING YOU... YOUR PERCEPTIONS, YOUR THOUGHTS, YOUR SENSATIONS, YOUR IMAGES. UH, SO THE HIGHEST FORM OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE IS TO BE ABLE TO OBSERVE YOURSELF WITHOUT JUDGING YOURSELF. AND IN THE MERE OBSERVATION OF YOURSELF WITHOUT JUDGMENT IS TRANSFORMATION, INSIGHT, INTUITION, CREATIVITY, IMAGINATION, HEALING, SELF-REPAIR, SELF-ORGANIZATION, HOMEOSTASIS, UM, THE TIMING OF YOUR BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS, UH, TO THE RHYTHMS OF THE UNIVERSE, WHICH WE CALL CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS AND YOU... SEASONAL RHYTHMS. IT'S HEALING, BASICALLY. IT'S YOUR ESSENTIAL STATE. YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING. YOU'RE NOT A HUMAN DOING. - IT'S THE IDEA OF JUST NOTICING. JUST NOTICING IN THE PRESENT MOMENT, WITHOUT PUTTING WORDS TO THE EXPERIENCE AND JUST... JUST NOTICING. THEN THERE'S THE DESCRIBING PRACTICE, WHICH IS JUST TO PUT WORDS ON WHAT THE EXPERIENCE IS. THE FLOWER HAS PETALS. THE PETALS ARE RED. UM, THE SMELL IS SWEET. [ BELL TOLLS ] - WHEN YOU, UH, BREATHE IN, AND IF YOU BRING YOUR MIND, YOUR ATTENTION TO YOUR IN-BREATH, YOUR MIND STOP ALL THINKING, WHETHER OF THE PAST, OF THE FUTURE, OF YOUR PROJECTS. YOUR MIND IS FOCUSING ONLY ON YOUR IN-BREATH. STOPPING THE THINKING HELP YOU. YOU BECOME YOUR BREATH, YOUR IN-BREATH. YOU ARE CONCENTRATED. YOU'RE ON YOUR IN-BREATH. AND WHEN YOU BREATHE OUT, YOU FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION ON YOUR OUT-BREATH. UH, YOU STOP THE THINKING. YOU ARE ONLY YOUR IN-BREATH. THE OBJECT, THE ONLY OBJECT OF YOUR MIND IS YOUR IN-BREATH AND YOUR OUT-BREATH. YOU ARE CONCENTRATED ON YOUR IN-BREATH, ON YOUR OUT-BREATH. AND IF YOU CONTINUE TO BREATH LIKE THAT FOR A FEW MOMENTS, THE QUALITY OF YOUR IN-BREATH AND OUT-BREATH WILL BE IMPROVED. YOUR IN-BREATH AND OUT-BREATH HAVE BECOME SLOWER, MORE PEACEFUL, MORE HARMONIOUS, AND YOU FEEL BETTER. THERE IS A PEACE NOW, MORE PEACE NOW IN YOUR BREATHING. AND AS YOUR, UH... YOUR BREATHING HAS BECOME MORE PEACEFUL, YOUR BODY WILL PROFIT FROM IT. THERE... THERE MAY BE A LOT OF TENSION AND PAIN IN YOUR BODY, BUT IF YOUR BREATH HAS BECOME PEACEFUL, YOUR BODY WILL BECOME MORE PEACEFUL. AND THE BUDDHA PROPOSED THAT, UH, WHEN WE, UH, GO BACK TO OUR BODY, UH, WE SHOULD, UH, RECOGNIZE OUR BODY AS EXISTING. AND, UH, WE... WE MAY REALIZE THAT THERE IS TENSION AND PAIN IN OUR BODY. SO HE PROPOSED... UM, HE PROPOSED, UH, THE EXERCISE, UM, BREATHING IN I'M AWARE OF MY WHOLE BODY. BREATHING OUT, I RELEASE THE TENSION IN MY BODY. SO TO GO BACK TO YOUR BODY AND TO RECOGNIZE THE PRESENCE OF YOUR BODY IS A KIND OF A RECONCILIATION BECAUSE, UM, YOU MIGHT HAVE NOT, UH, TAKEN GOOD CARE OF YOUR BODY. YOU MIGHT HAVE WORKED YOUR BODY TOO HARD. UH, YOU HAVE ALLOWED TENSION AND PAIN TO BE ACCUMULATED INTO YOUR BODY, AND, THEREFORE, YOU GO HOME. THE MIND GOING HOME TO THE BODY AND ALLOW THE BODY, UH, TO RELEASE THE TENSION. THAT'S VERY NICE. THAT IS THE PRACTICE OF, UH, RECONCILIATION WITH THE BODY, UH, HELPING THE BODY TO RELEASE THE TENSION. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. UH, WHEN YOU HAVE SOME PEACE IN YOUR BREATHING, UH, THAT PEACE WILL BE EXTENDED TO YOUR BODY. AND THEN IF YOU HAVE FEELINGS THAT ARE PAINFUL... EMOTIONS... UH, YOUR MINDFULNESS CAN HELP, UH, RECOGNIZE THESE EMOTIONS, THESE, UH, PAINFUL FEELINGS, UH, HOLD THEM REALLY TENDERLY AND HELP YOU TO GET THE RELIEF. SO, FIRST OF ALL, UM, YOU BRING YOUR MIND BACK TO YOUR BODY AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY AND YOUR BODY WILL HAVE MORE PEACE, MORE RELAXATION. AND THEN, UH, YOU ARE IN A POSITION TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR FEELINGS AND YOUR EMOTIONS. THERE ARE PLEASANT FEELING. THERE ARE PAINFUL FEELING. THERE ARE STRONG EMOTIONS THAT, UH, MAKE YOU, UM, SUFFER. SO MINDFULNESS IS THE KIND OF ENERGY THAT CAN ALSO RECOGNIZE, UH, A FEELING AND EMOTION AND ALSO HELP, UH, EMBRACE, TENDERLY, THAT FEELING, THAT EMOTION SO THAT YOU CAN GET THE RELIEF. AND IF YOU ARE, UH, A GOOD PRACTITIONER, IF YOU, UH, CONTINUE YOUR PRACTICE OF MINDFUL BREATHING, MINDFUL HOLDING, AND THEN, UH, YOU CAN LOOK DEEPLY INTO THE ROOTS OF YOUR FEELING, OF YOUR EMOTION AND FIND OUT, UH, THE REASONS, UH, THE CAUSES THAT HAVE BROUGHT THAT FEELING TO YOU. AND THAT KIND OF LOOKING DEEPLY IS CALLED MEDITATION. IT IDENTIFY THE SOURCES OF, UH, SUFFERING. AND ONCE YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED THE ROOTS OF YOUR... YOU'LL BE, UH... YOU CAN, UH, GET THE LIBERATION THAT YOU NEED. IT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR DOCTOR HAS IDENTIFY YOUR SICKNESS, AND THEN HE CAN PROPOSE YOU... TO YOU THE KIND OF MEDICINE, THE KIND OF LIFE THAT CAN HELP END, UH, THE SICKNESS. SO, UM, MINDFULNESS, UH, AND CONCENTRATION, UM, HELP BRING YOU RELIEF, HELP YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE DEEP, UH, ROOTS OF YOUR SUFFERING, HELP YOU TO SEE THE PATH LEADING THROUGH THE HEALING, THE TRANSFORMATION. - YES, MINDFULNESS HEALS BECAUSE IN MINDFULNESS THERE'S EQUANIMITY. AND WHEN THERE IS EQUANIMITY, THEN YOU'RE SUSTAINED IN THAT EQUANIMITY. THERE'S JOY. AND WHEN THERE'S JOY AND EQUANIMITY, THERE'S THE BIRTH, IN THAT, OF COMPASSION. AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS ACTUALLY CAUSE YOUR BODY TO GO TO ITS ESSENTIAL STATE, WHICH WE CALL... IN MEDICINE, WE CALL IT HOMEOSTASIS, WHICH IS SELF-REGULATION. IN OUR SOCIETY, PEOPLE ARE DOING, DOING, DOING. AND IT'S MOSTLY MINDLESS DOING. THEN, OF COURSE, THEY'RE THINKING A LOT, AND IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT THEMSELVES. UH, THERE'S NO CREATIVE THINKING OTHER THAN, YOU KNOW, IN THE CREATIVE FIELDS, WHERE EVEN THAT IS... IS MOSTLY, UH, WHAT I'LL CALL, UM, UH, SIMULATED CREATIVITY. IT'S NOT REAL CREATIVITY. THERE'S VERY LITTLE FEELING, AND THERE'S NO BEING. AND MINDFULNESS REVERSES THE WHOLE THING SPONTANEOUSLY. WHEN YOU'RE MINDFUL, YOU'RE IN A STATE OF BEING. AND WHEN YOU'RE IN THE STATE OF BEING, IT SPONTANEOUSLY AWAKENS LOVE AND COMPASSION. AND WHEN YOU'RE THERE, THEN IT SPONTANEOUSLY UNFOLDS INTO CREATIVITY, AND THEN YOU DO THE RIGHT THING. - BREATHE, YOU'RE ALIVE. IT MEANS NOTHING, AND IT MEANS EVERYTHING. IT DEPENDS ON OUR STATE OF MIND BECAUSE, AS MY BROTHER, UH, SHARED EARLIER, ALL OF US, WE BREATHE. IN THE WOMB, MOTHER BREATHE FOR US. AND THE MOMENT THAT WE ARE BORN AND WE START TO CRY, THAT'S OUR FIRST IN-BREATH. AND SO HOW EVER OLD WE ARE RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE BREATHED ALL OUR LIVES. BUT, FOR MOST OF US, IT MEANS NOTHING BECAUSE WE'RE NOT AWARE OF IT. THERE IS A BREATHING CENTER IN THE BRAIN THAT TAKES CARE OF IT. AND SO WE... WE DO NOT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. WE DO NOT HAVE TO BE AWARE OF IT. IT'S DONE AUTOMATICALLY. AND SO THE... THE LIFE THAT WE HAVE ALSO CONTINUES. IT CAN CONTINUE AUTOMATICALLY BECAUSE, UH, THE BODY HAS AN AMAZING CAPACITY TO TAKE CARE OF ITSELF, TO REGULATE ITSELF. AND SO BREATHE IS SOMETHING CAN BE VERY AUTOMATIC. AND TO BE ALIVE CAN BE VERY SOMETHING ALSO VERY AUTOMATIC FOR OUR WHOLE LIVES. BUT A PERSON WHO LEARNS TO BE AWARE THAT HE OR SHE IS BREATHING, THEN IT CHANGES EVERYTHING. WHEN A PERSON LEARNS THAT HE OR SHE IS ALIVE, IT REALLY CHANGES EVERYTHING... THE HEALTH, THE MENTAL HEALTH, AND ALSO THE PHYSICAL HEALTH. SO, IN THAT WAY, THE AWARENESS OF THE... OF THE BODY, WHICH IS THE BREATH. WE START WITH THE BREATH. WE LEARN TO BE AWARE OF THAT. AND WE LEARN TO TOUCH THE CHANGES IN THE BREATH, THE CHANGES IN THE BREATHING PATTERNS. AND THROUGH THAT, WE LEARN TO BE MORE AWARE OF OUR BODY, LIKE, RIGHT NOW, SOME OF US ARE QUITE RELAXED AND SOME OF USE ARE LESS RELAXED. BUT IF WE ARE AWARE OF OUR BREATHING, WE WILL BE MORE AWARE WHETHER WE ARE RELAXED OR LESS RELAXED. SO WE'RE IN TOUCH WITH THE BODY. AND WHEN WE'RE AWARE OF OUR BREATH, ALSO WE ARE AWARE OF OUR MIND BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE ANGER, WE BREATH DIFFERENTLY. WHEN WE HAVE SADNESS, WORRIES, WE BREATH DIFFERENTLY. SO WHEN WE LEARN TO BE AWARE... MORE AND MORE AWARE OF THE PATTERNS OF OUR BREATHING AND THE ABRUPT CHANGES IN EVERY MOMENT, THEN WE LEARN TO BE AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR MIND, WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR THOUGHTS AND PERCEPTIONS THAT CAUSES THE CHANGE OF THAT BREATHING PATTERN. AND SO IT MAKES LIFE VERY DYNAMIC, VERY LIVELY. - I ACTUALLY THINK THAT MINDFULNESS, UH, SHOULD BE THE CENTERPIECE OF PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT. BECAUSE, IN THE WEST, WE ARE SO SCIENTIFICALLY ORIENTED... SO IF WE PUT MINDFULNESS TO RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTATION, WE FIND THAT IT HAS WAYS OF WORKING WITH THE MIND THAT, UH, CALM THE MIND. AND I THINK THAT IN TODAY'S, UH, WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING IS A DISORDER, WE'RE PATHOLOGIZING EVERYTHING, UM, THAT MINDFULNESS HAS A CORE AND CENTRAL ROLE IN... IN HEALING. [ BELL TOLLS ] - IF YOU ARE MINDFUL, IF YOU ARE TRULY, UH, THERE... YOU ARE TRULY, TRULY THERE IN THE HERE AND THE NOW... YOU ARE CONCENTRATED AND DRINKING YOUR TEA AND MINDFULNESS IS, UH, SPIRITUALITY ALREADY. SO WHEN YOU, UH... WHEN YOU LOOK AT ONE PERSON, AND IF YOU ARE TRULY AWARE THAT HE IS THERE, SHE IS THERE, AND THAT PERSON THERE IS, UM, SUFFERING, THERE IS, UM, THE NEED TO TRANSFORM. AND IF YOU CAN LOOK AT HIM OR HER WITH COMPASSION AND UNDERSTANDING LIKE THAT, THAT IS SPIRITUALITY ALREADY. AND WHEN YOU, UH, TAKE A STEP AND IF, UH, YOU ARE AWARE THAT YOU ARE MAKING A STEP, THAT YOU ARE WALK... THAT YOU... YOU TOUCH, UH, THE EARTH WITH YOUR FOOT MINDFULLY, AND THAT IS, UM, A SPIRITUAL ACT ALSO. THERE IS A GREATER, UM... PLACING YOUR FOOT ON THE GROUND IS TO PERFORM A MIRACLE. EVERY MINDFUL STEP HELP REVEAL TO YOU THE KINGDOM OF GOD, THE PURE LAND OF THE BUDDHA. SO... SO WALKING WITH MINDFULNESS CAN HELP YOU TOUCH ALL THE WONDERS OF LIFE THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE HERE AND THE NOW, AND THAT'S VERY NOURISHING AND HEALING. UH, MANY OF US WALK LIKE SLEEPWALKERS. UH, WE DON'T ENJOY OUR STEPS. OUR MINDS... OUR MIND IS ELSEWHERE... IN OUR PROJECTS, IN THE FUTURE. SO, UH, WE DON'T GET THE HEALING, THE TRANSFORMATION. WE DON'T TOUCH THE KINGDOM OF GOD, UH, WITH ALL THE WONDERS... THE BLUE SKY, THE FLOWERS THAT ARE BLOOMING, THE GREEN HILLS, CHILDREN WHO ARE PLAY, WHO ARE PLAYING AROUND YOU. THEY ALL BELONG TO THE KINGDOM OF GOD, TO THE PURE LAND OF THE BUDDHA. AND IF YOU ARE TRULY IN THE HERE AND THE NOW, YOU CAN GET IN TOUCH. SO, UH, YOU CAN LIVE YOUR SPIRITUAL LIFE, UH, IN EVERY MINUTE OF YOUR DAILY LIFE. WHETHER YOU ARE DRIVING, OR EATING, OR COOKING OR WASHING, YOUR LIFE CAN BE SPIRITUAL IN EVERY MOMENT. AND, UH, IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH, UH, HEALING AND PEACE IN YOU, EVERYTHING YOU DO, YOU SAY, WILL HELP PEOPLE AROUND YOU. - BEING MINDFUL HELPS YOU BE A BETTER ACTOR BECAUSE IT HELPS ME BE A BETTER LISTENER. AND I THINK BEING A BETTER LISTENER IS THE ROOT OF BEING A BETTER ACTOR. - IN OTHER WORDS, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A DOG WHISPERER, I'M A DOG LISTENER. 'CAUSE I'M LISTENING... FROM THE MOMENT I AM 20 FEET IN FRONT OF A DOG, I KNOW HOW HE FEELS. THE DOG IS JUST TALKING. THERE'S JUST A HUMAN NOT LISTENING. WHAT DOG WHISPERER MEANS TO ME IS THE HUMAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO LISTEN. IT'S NOT THE HUMAN WHO IS WHISPERING IN THE EAR OF A DOG. THAT'S A MYTH. THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL TITLE. THAT'S VERY MAGICAL, YOU KNOW, BUT IT'S NOT REALITY. THE... THE HUMAN TELLS YOU THE STORY. THE DOG TELLS YOU THE REALITY. [ BELL TOLLS ] - MANY PEOPLE, UH, ARE NOT CAPABLE OF BEING... OF BEING HAPPY IN A PRESENT MOMENT. THEY THINK, UH, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO BE HAPPY RIGHT NOW, RIGHT HERE. THEY NEED MORE CONDITIONS TO BE HAPPY. SO MANY OF THEM ARE LOOKING FOR HAPPINESS IN THE FUTURE OR ELSEWHERE. BUT ACCORDING TO THE TEACHING OF THE BUDDHA, UH, YOU HAVE, UH, ENOUGH CONDITIONS TO BE HAPPY RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW. AND MINDFULNESS HELP YOU TO GO HOME TO THE PRESENT MOMENT AND TO RECOGNIZE THESE, UH, CONDITIONS OF HAPPINESS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. UH, IN THE TEACHING OF THE BUDDHA, IT IS SAID THAT, UH, IT IS POSSIBLE TO LIVE HAPPILY RIGHT IN THE HERE AND THE NOW. AND THAT IS WHY THE PRACTICE, UM, OF MINDFUL BREATHING, MINDFUL WALKING CAN BRING YOU HOME TO THE HERE AND THE NOW. THE PAST IS ALREADY GONE. THE FUTURE IS NOT YET THERE. YOU ONLY HAVE ONE MOMENT, UH, WHERE YOU CAN LIVE, UH, YOUR LIFE DEEPLY. THAT IS THE PRESENT MOMENT. UH, YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH LIFE IN THE... AND THAT APPOINTMENT TAKES PLACE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT. AND IF YOU MISS THAT, UH, THE PRESENT MOMENT, YOU MISS YOUR APPOINTMENT WITH LIFE. THEREFORE, UM, "I HAVE ARRIVED," MEANS I HAVE ARRIVED IN THE PRESENT MOMENT SO THAT I CAN MEET WITH LIFE AND ENCOUNTER LIFE. I HAVE ARRIVED IN THE HERE AND THE NOW. IT MEANS I DON'T RUN ANYMORE. I HAVE... I DO NOT WANT TO RUN ANYMORE. I HAVE RUN ALL MY LIFE, AND THAT IS WHY I AM DETERMINED TO STOP. SO EVERY BREATH, EVERY STEP BRING ME BACK TO THE HERE AND THE NOW SO THAT I CAN BE ESTABLISHED IN THE HERE AND THE NOW TO ENCOUNTER THE WONDERS OF LIFE THAT ARE AVAILABLE. SO, "I HAVE ARRIVED," MEANS, "I DON'T WANT TO RUN ANYMORE." "I WANT TO TOUCH LIFE DEEPLY." AND LIFE CAN BE TOUCHED DEEPLY ONLY IN THE HERE AND THE NOW. AND, UH, MY HOME IS IN THE HERE AND THE NOW. AND IF YOU LOOK DEEPLY, YOU'LL SEE THAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD, THE PURE LAND OF THE BUDDHA, YOUR HAPPINESS MUST BE SOUGHT, MUST... MUST BE FOUND IN THE HERE AND THE NOW. UH, THAT IS TO SAY THAT THE KINGDOM IS NOW OR NEVER. UM, THERE IS NO WAY TO HAPPINESS. HAPPINESS IS THE WAY. YOU HAVE TO FIND HAPPINESS RIGHT IN THE HERE AND THE NOW. SO I HAVE ARRIVED. I AM HOME. IT MEANS THAT I AM FULLY ESTABLISHED IN THE PRESENT MOMENT. I AM TRULY ALIVE. I AM TRULY, FULLY PRESENT. AND, UH, THAT IS NOT A STATEMENT, THAT IS A PRACTICE. UH, YOU BREATHE IN SUCH A WAY, YOU WALK IN SUCH A WAY THAT EVERY BREATH, EVERY STEP BRING YOU HOME TO THE HERE AND THE NOW. AND YOU ARE FREE FROM YOUR WORRIES, FROM YOUR DESPAIR, FROM YOUR REGRET. AND, UM, GETTING IN TOUCH WITH THE WONDERS OF LIFE THAT ARE REFRESHING AND HEALING AND NOURISHING, UH, YOU GET THE HEALING THAT YOU NEED. YOU CAN GET THE NOURISHMENT THAT YOU NEED. AND AFTER THAT, YOU CAN BE HELPFUL TO THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU. - RECENTLY THERE'S, UM, RESEARCH ON MEDITATION, AND I'M SURE IT APPLIES TO MINDFULNESS, AS WELL. IS THAT, UM, IT INCREASES THE LEVEL OF AN ENZYME CALLED TELOMERASE. TELOMERASE INFLUENCES THE LENGTH OF, UM, LITTLE TELOMERES, WHICH ARE LIKE BUTTONS AT THE END OF YOUR SHOELACES. LIKE YOUR CHROMOSOMES HAVE THESE BUTTONS SIMILAR TO THAT. AS WE GET OLDER, THESE BUTTONS, OR THEY'RE CALLED TELOMERES, THEY START TO FRAY. AND THEN WHEN THEY START TO FRAY TO A CERTAIN LEVEL, THAT'S BIOLOGICAL DEATH. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU... WE MEASURE THE BIOLOGICAL CLOCK THROUGH THE LENGTH OF TELOMERES. NOW, JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, THERE WAS A STUDY THAT DONE... WAS DONE BY SCIENTISTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF THE STUDY IS THE WOMAN WHO WON THE NOBEL PRIZE FOR DISCOVERING TELOMERASE. AND THEY SHOWED THAT WITHIN 3 TO 4 MONTHS OF MEDITATIVE PRACTICE... MINDFULNESS... YOU INCREASE TELOMERASE. SO YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR BIOLOGICAL CLOCK. - FIRST BENEFIT IS YOU'RE A HAPPY PERSON, AND YOU... YOU... WHEN I HOPE... I HONOR THE WEATHER THAT I'M HAPPY. AND WHEN I HANDLE A PIECE OF BREAD, I DO NOT NEED TO THINK ANYTHING. OH, IT'S COME FROM THE SKY, THE... THE GOOD RAIN, THE GOOD FARMER, THE GOOD HARVEST, A LOT OF LOVE, A LOT OF CARE. I LIVE THE PRESENT MOMENT, BUT I... I TASTE THE WHOLE UNIVERSE IN THAT WONDERFUL WAY OF, UM... AND I'M HAPPY. - WOULD I SAY ANIMALS ARE MORE MINDFUL THAN HUMANS? A HORSE, A CAT, A DOLPHIN, A DOG WILL KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL, REGARDLESS HOW DIFFERENT THEY ARE AS A SPECIES. ENERGY IS A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE THAT ALL ANIMALS HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO... TO BE MINDFULLY AWARE. - IF ONE HAS A SPIRITUAL RADIANCE ABOUT HIM, YOU SENSE IT. YOU SENSE IT IN THE EYES. YOU SENSE IT IN THE DEMEANOR. AND THAT PERSON CAN GENERALLY LIFT UP THE SPIRITS OF THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM. THAT'S WHAT'S REMARKABLE ALL OVER THE WORLD, EVERYWHERE I'VE GONE. [ BELL TOLLS ] - WHEN ANGER COMES UP, UH, YOU FEEL... YOU SUFFER. YOU SUFFER. AND IF YOU ALLOW ANGER TO POSSESS YOU, TO OVERWHELM YOU, UH, YOU GO ACT OR SAY THINGS THAT WILL CREATE, UH, SUFFERING. WHEN ANGER COMES UP, UH, IF, UH, YOU DON'T PRACTICE, YOU WILL SUFFER AND YOU WILL MAKE PEOPLE AROUND YOU SUFFER. AND IF YOU ARE A PRACTITIONER, YOU WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN ANGER IS COMING UP. UH, YOU GO BACK TO YOUR BREATHING. YOU PRACTICE MINDFUL BREATHING. YOU GENERATE THE ENERGY OF MINDFULNESS. AND WITH THAT, UH, ENERGY OF MINDFULNESS, YOU RECOGNIZE THAT ANGER IS... IS IN YOU. BREATHING IN, I KNOW ANGER IS IN ME. BREATHING OUT, I AM TAKING GOOD CARE OF MY ANGER. I AM HOLDING IT PEACEFULLY. AND THE ENERGY OF MINDFULNESS, EMBRACING THE ENERGY OF ANGER. OTHER WORD, THE ENERGY OF ANGER IS STILL THERE, BUT YOU ARE MUCH SAFER BECAUSE THE MINDFULNESS IS ALSO THERE. MINDFULNESS TELL YOU THAT ANGER, WHILE YOU ARE ANGER, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SAY ANYTHING OR TO DO ANYTHING. IT MAY CAUSE, UM, DAMAGE. SO YOU JUST CONTINUE TO PRACTICE MINDFUL BREATHING, MINDFUL WALKING SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOUR ANGER, AND YOU GET THE RELIEF. AND IF YOU ARE, UH... IF YOU, UH, PRACTICE LOOKING MORE DEEPLY, YOU WILL SEE THE ROOTS OF YOUR ANGER. AND, UH, THE CAUSE OF YOUR SUFFERING MIGHT BE IN YOU, UH, NOT MY... NOT IN THE OTHER PERSON. AND IF YOU RECOGNIZE THINGS LIKE THAT, UH, YOU CAN, UH, TRANSFORM YOUR ANGER. SOMETIME, UM, MANY TIMES, UM, THE SEED OF ANGER IN YOU IS VERY IMPORTANT. UH, OTHER PEOPLE, WHEN THEY HEAR THE SAME SENTENCE, THEY DON'T GET ANGRY. BUT YOU, YOU GET ANGRY BECAUSE THE SEED OF ANGER IN YOU IS TOO IMPORTANT. SO NOW YOU HAVE THE INSIGHT THAT THE SUFFERING COMES FROM YOU MORE THAN FROM THE OTHER PERSON. SO THAT IS THE KIND OF INSIGHT THAT CAN HELP YOU TO TRANSFORM. AND THEN, WHEN YOU LOOK DEEPLY AT THE OTHER PERSON, YOU SEE THAT THAT PERSON HAS A LOT OF, UH, ANGER AND SUFFERING IN HIM. AND, UH, HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE HIS SUFFERING SO, UH, HE MAKE THOSE PEOPLE AROUND HIM SUFFER. AND YOU HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THEM. SO IF YOU TRY TO PUNISH HIM, HE WILL SUFFER MORE. AND IF HE SUFFER MORE, HE WILL MAKE YOU SUFFER MORE. SO THAT PERSON NEEDS HELP AND DOES NOT NEED PUNISHMENT. AND YOU MAY BE MOTIVATED BY THE DESIRE TO GO AND HELP HIM. AND WHEN YOU ARE MOTIVATED BY THE DESIRE TO GO AND HELP HIM, UH, YOUR ANGER HAS BECOME COMPASSION. UH, YOU HAVE TRANSFORMED. SO THAT IS THE KIND OF INSIGHT THAT YOU CAN GET WHILE YOU PRACTICE MINDFULNESS AND CONCENTRATION. - THE HUMAN BRAIN IS A VERY FASCINATING THREE-POUND, SOFT, JELL-O-LIKE ORGAN INSIDE THE SKULL, WHICH IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE. WE HAVE THREE PARTS TO OUR BRAIN. THE FIRST PART OF THE BRAIN IS CALLED THE MIDBRAIN. IT'S ALSO CALLED THE REPTILIAN BRAIN. THE REPTILIAN BRAIN EVOLVED 300 MILLION YEARS AGO. UH, THE REASON IT'S CALLED THE REPTILIAN BRAIN IS THAT WHEN YOU GO NEXT TO A REPTILE, AND YOU EITHER MAKE A SUDDEN MOVEMENT OR A SUDDEN NOISE, IF YOU'RE VERY CLOSE, THE REPTILE WILL ATTACK YOU. IF YOU'RE A LITTLE FURTHER AWAY, IT WILL SLITHER AWAY. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF WHAT WE CALL THE FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT RESPONSE. AND THIS THEN BECOMES, IN OUR SOCIETY, THE STRESS RESPONSE. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO SAVE YOURSELF FROM A SABRE-TOOTHED TIGER, BUT SOMEBODY BLOWS THE HORN AT YOU, OR SOMEBODY SAYS SOMETHING THAT TRIGGERS AN OLD HURT OR PUSHES YOUR BUTTONS, AND YOU ATTACK, YOU RUN. AND SOMETIMES YOU'RE NOT ATTACKING OR RUNNING, BUT YOU FEEL FRUSTRATED. THAT RAISES YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE. HEART RATE GOES UP. CORTISOL GOES UP. UH, ADRENALINE GOES UP. UM, STRESS IS LINKED TO ALMOST EVERY MAJOR EPIDEMIC OF CIVILIZATION, WHETHER IT IS CANCER OR HEART DISEASE OR INFECTIONS OR PREMATURE AGING, UM, SUDDEN DEATH FROM CARDIOVASCULAR ILLNESS, ALL LINKED TO STRESS. AND THIS IS WHAT THE STRESS IS... THE MIDBRAIN REACTING AS IT HAS DONE FOR 300 MILLION YEARS. THEN THE SECOND PART OF YOUR BRAIN IS CALLED THE LIMBIC BRAIN, WHICH IS ABOUT 100 MILLION YEARS OLD. THIS IS OUR EMOTIONAL BRAIN. SO WE HAVE BASICALLY FIVE EMOTIONS, AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS A VARIANT OF THEM. THE FIRST EMOTION IS HAPPINESS. OKAY, SO LOVE, COMPASSION, KINDNESS, THEY ALL FIT IN HAPPINESS. IT MAKES YOU HAPPY WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE. THE SECOND EMOTION IS SADNESS. THE THIRD IS ANGER AND HOSTILITY. THE FOURTH IS FEAR. THE FIFTH IS SHAME AND, UH, WHAT DO YOU CALL... UM, GUILT. AND EVERY OTHER EMOTION... DISGUST, JEALOUSY... IS A VARIANT OF THESE. NOW, IT TURNS OUT THAT WHEN YOU'RE HAPPY... AND THIS HAPPENS ONLY IN MAMMALS. REPTILES DON'T HAVE AN EMOTIONAL LIFE, OKAY, BUT MAMMALS, ALL MAMMALS, FORM SOCIAL GROUPS. ALL MAMMALS NURTURE THEIR YOUNG. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, ALL MAMMALS SING. OKAY, ALL MAMMALS PLAY. AND, UH, THIS IS THE EXPERIENCE OF WHAT WE CALL LOVE. THAT OCCURS, UM, IMMEDIATELY AFTER A CHILD IS BORN, AND EVEN IN THE ANTICIPATION OF A CHILD. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT OUR FEEDBACK LOOPS, SELF-REPAIR MECHANISMS IN THE BODY, ARE MATURED AND COME INTO EXISTENCE AS A RESULT OF THE EXPERIENCE OF LOVE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT ATTENTION, AFFECTION, APPRECIATION, COOING, CUDDLING, KISSING, TOUCHING, UM, THE DANCE BETWEEN AN ADULT AND A CHILD, WHICH IS EYE MOVEMENTS, FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, BODY LANGUAGE, VOICE TONE... A CHILD DOESN'T UNDERSTAND RATIONAL LANGUAGE BUT UNDERSTANDS THAT LANGUAGE FROM DAY ONE. OKAY, AND THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MATURATION OF SELF-REPAIR MECHANISMS AND SELF-REGULATION. IF YOU'RE... IF YOU'RE DEPRIVED OF THAT, YOU WILL BE A SICK ADULT. YOU KNOW, UH, WHEN YOU GROW UP, YOUR... YOUR EVERYTHING WILL BE EFFECTED BECAUSE THE SELF-REPAIR IS LINKED TO HORMONE LEVELS, BODY-TEMPERATURE REGULATION, AUTONOMIC RESPONSES, EVERYTHING THAT KEEPS THE BODY HEALTHY. THAT'S OUR LIMBIC BRAIN. MOST PEOPLE HAVE DYSFUNCTIONAL LIMBIC SYSTEMS IN THAT THEY'RE RESENTFUL OR ANGRY ABOUT THE PAST. THEY'RE ANTICIPATING SOMETHING... FEAR IN THE FUTURE. THEY HAVE SHAME AND GUILT ABOUT THINGS THAT THEY REGRET, THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE. AND AS A RESULT, YOU KNOW, THEIR BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS ARE TOTALLY DISRUPTED. UM, BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN YOU HAVE WHAT THE BUDDHISTS CALL LOVING KINDNESS, JOY, PEACE OF MIND AND, UH, UH, COMPASSION... THE BUDDHISTS CALL THEM DIVINE ATTRIBUTES... IN THAT STATE, YOUR BODY'S THE BEST IT COULD POSSIBLY BE, OKAY? SO THAT'S YOUR LIMBIC BRAIN. AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS CORTICAL BRAIN, WHICH IS HUGE... UH, WHICH IS ONLY 4 MILLION YEARS OLD. THE CORTICAL BRAIN HOUSES RATIONALITY. IT'S ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR ORCHESTRATING INTENTION, YOU KNOW. AND IT SEEMS THIS IS THE PLACE WE USE, UH, FOR IMAGINATION AND INSIGHT AND INTUITION AND CREATIVITY. NOW, HERE'S THE SECRET. IN MINDFULNESS, WHAT YOU CAN LEARN TO DO, AND THIS IS PROVEN SCIENTIFICALLY... YOU CAN TOTALLY OVERRIDE YOUR MIDBRAIN. SO A PERSON LIKE TIKLATAN, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES, HIS MIDBRAIN IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONING. YOU CAN'T GET HIM TO BE ANGRY OR FEEL HOSTILITY OR RESENTFUL. HE'S JUST... HE'S QUIETENED IT, OKAY, THROUGH MINDFULNESS PRACTICE. AND IF YOU STAY IN THAT MINDFULNESS PRACTICE, YOU FEEL SO CONNECTED THAT, SPONTANEOUSLY, YOUR LIMBIC SYSTEM STARTS TO GET ACTIVATED. SO YOU NURTURE ONLY HEALTHY EMOTIONS, LIKE LOVE, COMPASSION, JOY, ET CETERA, THAT COME FROM THAT PLACE OF EQUANIMITY. SO YOU'RE USING YOUR CORTICAL BRAIN TO, FIRST OF ALL, OVERRIDE THE DETRIMENTAL, DESTRUCTIVE TENDENCIES OF THE MIDBRAIN, WHICH IS NO LONGER RELEVANT IN A MODERN SOCIETY. AND YOU'RE ALSO ACTIVATING THE LIMBIC BRAIN FOR NURTURING RELATIONSHIPS. YOU'RE LITERALLY REWIRING YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM. IN NEUROSCIENCE, WE SAY, "NEURONS THAT FIRE TOGETHER, WIRE TOGETHER." YOU'RE AN INTELLIGENT HUMAN BEING WHO HAS SUBDUED THEIR REPTILIAN BRAIN, WHO KNOWS HOW TO ACTIVATE THE LIMBIC BRAIN, WHO KNOWS HOW TO SELF-REPAIR AND HEAL, WHO HAS MORE INTUITION, INSIGHT, IMAGINATION, CREATIVITY, AND CHOICE-MAKING. IT'S A NEW EVOLUTION OF THE HUMAN SPECIES. - IMAGINE A SITUATION WHERE, UM, YOUR DAY WAS GOING FINE. SOMEONE LOOKED AT YOU IN A WAY THAT YOU IMAGINED WAS ATTACKING, ACCUSATORY, OR JUDGMENTAL, AND YOU GET ANGRY. NOW, WHEREAS, IN THE PAST, YOU MIGHT HAVE BECOME VERY ANGRY AND DISREGULATED AND DONE BEHAVIORS THAT... THAT GOT YOU INTO MORE TROUBLE, WHETHER IT'S DRUGS OR ALCOHOL OR WHATEVER IT IS. WHAT YOU DO WITH MINDFULNESS IS YOU PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT IS IN THIS PRESENT MOMENT. WHAT HAPPENED? DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED. THE PERSON LOOKED AT ME FROM THE SIDE OF THEIR FACE. THEY SEEM TO HAVE A FROWN. WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING, YOU'RE DESCRIBING WHAT IS, NOT WHAT YOU IMAGINE IT TO BE. AND BY DOING THAT, IT GIVES YOU A FIGHTING CHANCE OF STAYING A LOT CALMER THAN WHAT YOU COULD HAVE GONE BECAUSE ONCE YOU START DESCRIBING, THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE CURIOUS. YOU MIGHT ASK THE PERSON... "HEY, WHY DID YOU GIVE ME THAT BAD LOOK?" HE SAYS, "WHAT BAD LOOK? YOU KNOW, I HAVE GASTRIC PROBLEMS FROM THE BURRITO I HAD AT LUNCH TODAY. AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I WAS GRIMACING." I MEAN, WHO KNOWS. - WE SHOULD BE LISTENING TO EACH OTHER. YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? BECAUSE, OFTEN, IT'S... IT'S LITTLE THINGS THAT WE MISINTERPRET. AND WE GO INTO FIGHT, FLIGHT, AVOIDANCE BETWEEN YOU AND I. WE DON'T GO INTO SURRENDER. BUT ONCE WE LISTEN, WE UNDERSTAND... "AH, I GET IT." - DURING THE DAY, THIS ALWAYS... LIFE NEVER UNFOLD EXACTLY LIKE WE WISH. - RIGHT. - YEAH. AND SO WE HAVE TO EXPECT THAT WHEN PEOPLE PROMISE SOMETHING, THEY DON'T DO IT. IT'S NORMAL IN THAT WE FEEL IRRITATE. BUT WE FEEL IRRITATE, WE SAY THAT, "WHEN I'M IRRITATE, I DO NOT FULFILL MY TASK IN THE BEST WAY." SO I GO BACK TO MY IN-BREATH AND OUT-BREATH AND CALMING AND RELAXING AND SAY THAT, "I WILL DEAL WITH THAT." SO YOU NOTE THAT UNSATISFIED THING. AND YOU DO OTHER THING WHO NOT MAKE YOU IRRITATE FIRST. YOU COME BACK... YOU WILL COME BACK, BUT WHY YOU DO THE OTHER JOB PROFOUNDLY? THE OTHER THINGS WILL SETTLE A LITTLE BIT. AND THEN SOME TIME DURING YOUR WORK... THE SECOND WORK HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FIRST WORK. IT MAKE YOU IRRITATE. SECOND WORK MINDFULLY... SUDDENLY THERE IS AN INSIGHT BECAUSE YOUR IRRITATION SEND A MESSENGER INTO YOUR STAR CONSCIOUSNESS. THIS MEAN THE DEEP PART OF YOURSELF, YOUR UNCONSCIOUS. THAT WASN'T IS ALWAYS LIKE THAT. HE HAS THAT QUALITIES. HE HAS THAT WEAKNESS. SO SUDDENLY YOU REMEMBER THAT TO HANDLE THAT SITUATION, YOU HAVE TO TOUCH THAT POINT IN ORDER TO HELP HIM TO CHANGE. I HELP HIM TO CHANGE. SO... AND THEN YOU GO BACK TO WORK. YOU SAY THAT, "I DONE HANDLE THAT." - YOU'RE LISTENING TO THE OUTCOME, NOT THE FUNDAMENTALS. SO IT'S FUNDAMENTALS, TECHNIQUE AND OUTCOME. MOST OF THE PEOPLE SEES AGGRESSION. I SEE BEFORE AGGRESSION. THEREFORE, I CAN PREVENT AGGRESSION. - JUST TAKE THOSE 3 SECONDS WHEN YOU WALK INTO A ROOM, WHEN YOU WALK INTO ANY NEW SITUATION. AND THAT HELPS ME QUITE A BIT, BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING IN SO MUCH THAT I FIND, IF I JUST DON'T... DON'T JUST BLOW THROUGH EVERYTHING AND I TAKE THOSE 3 SECONDS, OR I GET A NEW SITUATION, IF I JUST... [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] I WILL FIND THAT I HAVE THAT INTUITIVE NOTION. AND IF I JUST... AND JUST HIT IT THERE FOR A SECOND, I'VE GOT THE INFORMATION THAT I NEED TO HANDLE EACH GIVEN SITUATION... THAT IT'S BEEN PUT BEFORE ME, AND I HAVE IT IN MY HEAD ACCOUNT. I'VE BEEN GIVEN THAT INFORMATION ALREADY. I'VE SEEN IT SOMEWHERE. I HAVE IT IN MY MIND. I'VE BEEN PREPARED FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE BEFALLING ME. I'M ACTUALLY READY. YOU ALMOST SEE IT BEFORE IT HAPPENS. YOU CAN SEE IT COMING. IT'S LIKE IF YOU WOULD SEE, LIKE, A TSUNAMI. YOU SEE THE WAVE FAR OUT IN THE OCEAN. IT'S LIKE IT'S SLOW-MOTION. "AH, THERE'S THE WAVE. I THINK I'LL GO GET MY STUFF, PUT IT IN THE CAR, AND DRIVE FAR UP IN THE MOUNTAIN LONG BEFORE THE WAVE COMES TO THE SHORE." - IN MINDFULNESS, THERE'S ALSO THESE, UH... THESE MINDFUL PRACTICES. FIRST, YOU... YOU EVOKE LOVE AND COMPASSION IN YOUR MIND FOR SOMEBODY THAT IT WOULD BE EASY FOR YOU TO DO, LIKE YOUR CHILD OR YOUR SPOUSE OR SOMEBODY THAT YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT. YOU EVOKE THAT IN YOUR MIND. YOU OBSERVE AN ACT OF COMPASSION OR LOVE. BUT THEN YOU COULD GO TO, UM, THE MALL AND SEE A STRANGER. AND IF YOU'RE MINDFUL, YOU'LL REALIZE THAT THAT STRANGER HAS JOY AND SORROW LIKE YOU DO, PLEASURE AND PAIN LIKE YOU DO, IS GONNA GROW OLD LIKE YOU DO, IS GONNA DIE ONE DAY LIKE YOU DO. I MEAN, YOU DO THAT, YOU HAVE COMPASSION FOR THAT HUMAN BEING 'CAUSE HE'S JUST LIKE YOU. AND THEN YOU CAN DO THAT WITH AN ENEMY... UH, A PERCEIVED ENEMY. AND SLOWLY, YOU TRAIN YOUR MIND, UH, IN SUCH AWAY THAT YOU DEPRIVE YOURSELF OF ALL ENEMIES. - WELL, THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ENJOY THE MOST ABOUT AN ANIMAL, RIGHT? THE NUMBER ONE IS UNCONDITIONAL LOVE, RIGHT? NUMBER TWO IS HOW PRESENT THEY ARE. NUMBER THREE IS THEY LIVE IN THE MOMENT. NUMBER FOUR IS THEY'RE THE MASTER OF FORGIVING. HOW MANY TIMES HUMAN MAKES MISTAKES EVERY SINGLE DAY? HOW OFTEN THE DOG FORGIVE THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY? - ONE OF THE BEST GOALS OF BUDDHISM IS TO TAKE NEGATIVE ENERGY AND MAKE IT POSITIVE. AND THAT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DO. - DURING THE WAR IN VIETNAM, I HEARD THAT MY HOMETOWN HAD BEEN BOMBARD. AND... AND I, RIGHT AWAY, TOOK MANY MEANS TO GO TO MY HOMETOWN. AND WHEN I ARRIVED, I WAS SO MAD BECAUSE, UM, MOST OF THE HOUSE, BIG HOUSE... AND, UNFORTUNATELY, ONLY MY HOUSE IS HALFWAY BOMBARD. AND WE STILL LIVE IN. MOST OF OTHER HOUSE HAD BEEN BOMBARD. AND PEOPLE CRY AND SCREAM. AND THEY SAY THAT, "OH." THEY HATE ONLY. THEY HATE THE SIDE OF NATIONALISTS. THEY HATE THE SIDE OF COMMUNISTS. THEY SAY THAT, "YEAH, THE COMMUNISTS TRIED TO... TO... TO, MM... TO PROVOKE. AND THE NATIONALISTS CALLED AMERICAN PLANE TO BOMBARD." AND... AND SO I'M ANGRY AT EVERYTHING. I DON'T KNOW, AND SO I... I SAY THAT, "WHAT I CAN DO?" I WENT BACK TO MY BREATH. AND I WALK CALMLY, MINDFULLY. I WALK. AND DURING THE... I TRIED TO BE MINDFUL IN MY STEP. IT MEANS MY MIND ONLY WITH THE CONTACT OF MY SHOES AND THE GROUND... THAT'S ALL. AND I WALK, I WALK. AND SUDDENLY, AMONG THE RUIN, I SAW THE LITTLE FLOWER, VERY TINY, LITTLE, VIOLET FLOWER, COME THROUGH ON THE RUIN, LIKE SMILING. AND I SAID, "OH, THE LITTLE FLOWER THERE TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS RUIN AND... AND... AND BLOOM. AND ME, I CANNOT BE IN MY PEACE." AND THEN I CALM MYSELF. AND I LOOK AROUND. AND I TRIED TO SEE POSITIVE THING. I SEE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO TRIED THEIR BEST TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE WOUNDED, THOSE WHO ARE STILL BURY... SOMETHING. AND THEN, SO THEY HAVE PEOPLE WHO MAKE RICE BALL TO GO AND DISTRIBUTE TO THOSE WHO HAVE NOTHING. THERE ARE THOSE WHO CARRY BECAUSE THE BOMBARD IS GONE ALREADY. AND SO... SO I FEEL THAT I SEE MANY BODIES THAT FAR... MANY GREAT BEING WHO ARE NOT ANGRY LIKE ME. AND I WANT TO SHOUT. BUT THEY TRIED TO HELP, TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS. SO THAT IT TENDS TO THE... THE GOING TO MY PEACE THAT I CAN SEE MANY WONDERFUL THING. AND WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR OWN PEACE, YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO AND WHAT NOT TO DO. [ BELL TOLLS ] - FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT FEAR IS IN YOU. MOST OF PEOPLE... MOST OF PEOPLE, UM... TRY TO FORGET. THEY ARE AFRAID OF MANY THINGS. THEY ARE AFRAID OF LOSING THEIR JOB, THAT THE OTHER PERSON DOES NOT LOVE THEM ANYMORE, THAT, UH, TOMORROW THEY WILL BE SICK, ABANDONED, THAT, UH, THEY WILL DIE... THINGS LIKE THAT. AND, UM, THEY DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS. THEY GET BUSY IN ORDER TO FORGET. AND, UM, MOST OF THE TIME THE FEAR... THE FEAR... DOES NOT HAVE, UH, A FOUNDATION. THEY ARE AFRAID OF THINGS THAT DO NOT EXIST. AND THAT IS WHY THEY NEED TO, UH... TO LOOK, UH, DEEPLY. UH, OR THEY MIGHT NEED A FRIEND TO TELL THEM THAT, UM... THAT, UH, THEIR FEAR HAS NO FOUNDATION, UM, SO THAT THEY CAN RECOGNIZE, UM, THE NATURE OF THEIR FEAR AND GET LIBERATED. THERE IS, UH, A WONDERFUL, UH, PRACTICE IN BUDDHISM, UH, THAT IS VERY HELPFUL, UH, FOR US TO REDUCE OUR SUFFERING. THAT IS THE PRACTICE OF THIS AVOIDING THE SECOND ARROW. WHEN SOMEONE IS STRUCK BY... WHEN SOMEONE IS, UM, HIT BY AN ARROW, UM, THAT PERSON SUFFERS, OF COURSE. BUT IF, UH, A SECOND ARROW COMES AND, UH, STRIKE HIM OR HER EXACTLY AT THE SAME SPOT, UH, THE PAIN WILL BE MANY, MANY TIMES, UH, MORE INTENSE. AND THAT IS WHY IT IS VERY HELPFUL TO AVOID, UM, THE SECOND ARROW. AND THE BUDDHA SAID THAT, UM, SOMETIMES SOMETHING HAVE HAPPENED TO YOUR BODY, TO YOUR MIND. UH, YOU SUFFER. BUT IF YOU GET ANGRY AT IT, IF YOU, UH, WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT IT, UH, YOU WILL MAGNIFY THE PAIN INTO 100 TIMES. UH, SO, UH, UH, IF YOU IMAGINE TOO MUCH, UH, IF YOU DON'T KNOW, UH, THE REALITY OF YOUR PAIN... AND THEN YOU WILL SUFFER 10 TIME MORE OR 100 TIME MORE. SO THAT KIND OF, UH, ANGER, THAT KIND OF, UM, IMAGINATION, THAT KIND OF FEAR, UH, INTENSIFY YOUR PAIN BY 10 TIME, 100 TIME MORE. THAT IS THE SECOND ARROW, YOU SEE? SO FEAR, UH, CAN MAKE YOU SUFFER MUCH MORE. AND FEAR IS BASED ON IGNORANCE. AND THAT IS WHY LOOKING DEEPLY HELP YOU TO HAVE THE INSIGHT THAT CAN DISSIPATE, REMOVE YOUR... YOUR IGNORANCE. AND TEACHER OR A FRIEND CAN HELP YOU TO SEE THAT, UH, YOUR FEAR HAS NO FOUNDATION. - I GREW UP ON A FARM... NUMBER ONE. I GREW UP WITH A PHILOSOPHY OF NEVER WORK AGAINST MOTHER NATURE. ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU, HUMAN, GAIN THEIR TRUST, RESPECT THEM. THEY'RE GONNA GIVE YOU A BEAUTIFUL GIFT CALLED LOYALTY. SO ONCE YOU GREW UP WITH THOSE TWO SENTENCES, EH, THIS IS WHAT YOU BECOME, RIGHT? YOU LIVE A PHILOSOPHY, YOU LIVE A LIFESTYLE THAT TRIGGERS AN ENERGY IN YOU, RIGHT? WELL, IN THE ANIMAL WORLD, THIS IS VERY ATTRACTIVE, YOU KNOW, TO BE CALM FROM WITHIN, BECAUSE ANIMALS' BIGGEST GOAL IS THE FAMILY AND THE HARMONY, TO BE PART OF A FAMILY AND TO LIVE A HARMONIOUS LIFE. ONCE YOU STUDY HUMAN, THAT'S NOT HIS GOAL. HIS GOAL IS FAME. HIS GOAL IS MONEY. HIS GOAL IS A DEGREE. MY CLIENTS ARE HARVARD GRADUATES, BUT THEY CAN'T WORK A CHIHUAHUA. - WHETHER YOU HAVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL REASON, OR WHETHER YOU HAVE A SPIRITUAL THING, IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT STRESS HAS TAKEN A MASSIVE TOLL ON THIS COUNTRY, HOW WE THINK ABOUT EACH OTHER. AND THAT BY BRINGING MINDFUL PRACTICE BACK... AN ANCIENT PRACTICE THAT WAS ALWAYS THERE, THE WISDOM TO USE IT WAS ALWAYS THERE... BACK INTO OUR LIVES, WE BEGIN TO HAVE A MUCH HEALTHIER AND HOLISTIC WAY OF APPROACHING STRESS AND, IN FACT, BRING A STILLNESS AND CONTENTMENT TO OUR LIFE THAT IS MORE PROFOUND THAN ANY QUICK HIT. - WE DO THINGS THE WAY WE DO BECAUSE WE'RE NOT AWARE. SO THEN IT'S JUST A PATTERN. IT'S JUST TO GO OUT EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT, OR THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT IT BECOMES VERY BORING. BUT YOU STILL GO BECAUSE WHAT ELSE DO YOU DO? SO I SHARE WITH TEENAGERS THAT, YOU KNOW, BE AWARE WHAT'S GOING ON. AND YOU... WHEN YOU HAVE THAT SENSE OF CALMNESS, IT'S ACTUALLY VERY ATTRACTIVE TO OTHERS WHEN YOU ARE, UH, CALM AND COMPOSED AND YOU SEEM, YOU KNOW, TO BE AT EASE WITH YOURSELF. OTHER GUYS WILL COME AND ASK YOU. OR YOU HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO GO AND ASK A GUY TO... TO DANCE. SO THAT'S A LITTLE TIP I SHARE WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE. - I THINK PEOPLE CAN HAVE THIS... THESE THINGS HAPPEN JUST BECAUSE YOU NEED SOME HELP. YOU NEED SOME WAY TO BALANCE YOUR LIFE. FOR ME, THIS MINDFULNESS, THIS WAY TO BE RESPONSIBLE, THIS WAY TO BE RESPECTFUL TO YOURSELF AND OTHERS, THIS WAY TO FIND A QUIET JOURNEY WHEN THE WORLD JUST SEEMS TOO CHAOTIC... AND WHEN THINGS ARE HAPPENING TO YOU. AND YOU THINK, "I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN HANDLE ALL OF THESE THINGS." IT'S... IT'S GONNA BE A BALANCE. NOTHING IS... IS JUST GREAT ALL THE TIME. AND YOU'RE GONNA... EVERY... LIFE IS... IS... IS DIFFICULT. LIFE IS... IS A STRUGGLE. YOU HAVE TO WORK HARD TO HAVE THINGS GO AHEAD. AND LIFE DOESN'T GET EASIER, BUT THINGS GET EASIER TO UNDERSTAND. - NEUROTIC ENVIRONMENT MAKES A NEUROTIC DOG. AGGRESSIVE ENVIRONMENT MAKES AN AGGRESSIVE DOG. A FEARFUL ENVIRONMENT MAKES A FEARFUL DOG. [ BELL TOLLS ] - FOR THOSE, UH, OF US WHO HAVE, UH, LOOKED DEEPLY INTO THE NATURE OF SICKNESS, OF DEATH, OF OLD AGE, UH, WE CAN ALSO TRANSCEND OUR FEAR BECAUSE, UH, LOOKING DEEPLY, YOU CAN SEE THAT, UM... THAT, UH, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR US TO GO THROUGH THESE THINGS PEACEFULLY, SICKNESS AND OLD AGE AND DEATH. UH, WHEN YOU LOOK AT, UH, A CLOUD, AND IF YOU, UH, LOOK DEEPLY, YOU SEE THAT THE NATURE OF... OF A CLOUD IS A NATURE OF NO BIRTH AND NO DEATH. I KNOW THAT A CLOUD HAS NOT, UH, COME FROM NON-BEING BEFORE. UH, THE CLOUD IS A CLOUD. THE CLOUD HAD BEEN OTHER THINGS. SO A CLOUD HAS... HAS NOT COME FROM NOTHING. SO THE... THE NATURE OF THE CLOUD IS NO BIRTH. THE... THE APPEARANCE OF THE CLOUD, THE FORM OF... OF A CLOUD IS ONLY A CONTINUATION. BEFORE A CLOUD IS A CLOUD, IT HAS BEEN THE WATER VAPOR. IT HAS BEEN THE... THE WATER IN THE OCEAN, THE HEAT GENERATED BY THE SUN. SO THE... THE... THE CLOUD IS ONLY THE CONTINUATION. AND WHEN THE CLOUD CEASES TO BE A CLOUD, THAT'S NOT DYING. A CLOUD, UH, CANNOT DIE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR A CLOUD TO DIE. A CLOUD CAN BECOME RAIN OR SNOW OR ICE, BUT A CLOUD CANNOT BECOME NOTHING. AND IF THE CLOUD KNOWS HOW TO MEDITATE, IT WILL SEE THAT, UH, ITS NATURE IS NATURE OF NO DEATH, NO DYING. UH, TO BE A CLOUD FLOATING IN THE SKY IS WONDERFUL, BUT TO BECOME THE RAIN FALLING ON A RICE FIELD ON THE MOUNTAIN IS ALSO WONDERFUL. UM, AND A CLOUD CAN LOOK DOWN AND SEE PART OF THE CLOUD HAS BECOME, UM, UH, THE RIVER. SO TO BECOME A RIVER IS ALSO NICE. AND WHEN YOU PRACTICE MEDITATION DEEPLY, YOU SEE THAT YOUR NATURE IS NATURE OF NO BIRTH AND NO DEATH. AND YOU CAN CLEANSE, THEN, THE FEAR OF BIRTH AND DEATH. YOU SEE? SO THERE ARE MANY WAYS OF PRACTICE IN ORDER TO... TO DEAL WITH OUR FEAR AND, UH, BECAUSE WE ARE SO BUSY IN OUR DAILY LIFE, WE HAVE NO TIME IN ORDER TO PRACTICE. WE HAVE BECOME VICTIMS OF FEAR, ANGER, FRUSTRATION. AND THAT IS WHY IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE IN SOCIETY, UH, SHOULD BRING IN, UH, A SPIRITUAL DIMENSION TO THEIR LIFE SO THAT THEY WILL SUFFER LESS. A POLITICIAN, A BUSINESSMAN, A SCHOOL TEACHER, A FILMMAKER SHOULD BRING, UH, UM, IN, UH, THEIR LIFE A SPIRITUAL DIMENSION SO THAT THEY WILL SUFFER LESS. AND WHEN THEY SUFFER LESS, THEY CAN DO THEIR JOB, UH, MUCH BETTER. - THERE'S NO NEED TO FEAR DEATH BECAUSE DEATH DOESN'T HAPPEN TO YOU. DEATH IS, BASICALLY, YOU UPGRADE THE ILLUSION, I THINK, AFTER DEATH. - THERE IS NO WAY TO HAPPINESS. HAPPINESS IS THE WAY. THERE IS NO WAY TO PEACE. PEACE IS THE WAY. AND THE WAY IS TO BREATHE IN MINDFULLY. THE WAY IS TO TAKE ONE MINDFUL STEP BECAUSE WHEN YOU, UH, WHEN YOU DO THAT, UH, THE ENERGY OF MINDFULNESS IS, UH, GENERATED. AND IT IS EXACTLY WITH THAT ENERGY OF MINDFULNESS THAT YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THE SUFFERING INSIDE. AND YOU EMBRACE IT. AND YOU GET A RELIEF. - WE'RE NOT HUMAN BEINGS WHO HAVE OCCASIONAL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES. WE ARE SPIRITUAL BEINGS WHO HAVE OCCASIONAL HUMAN EXPERIENCES. [ BELL TOLLS ] - IF YOU DON'T HAVE PEACE, YOU CANNOT OFFER PEACE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE CALM, YOU CANNOT OFFER CALM. IF YOU DON'T HAVE COMPASSION, YOU CANNOT OFFER COMPASSION. AND THEREFORE, UH, YOU HAVE TO WALK, UH, THE TALK. YOU HAVE TO DO IT FOR YOU FIRST. IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOVE YOURSELF, YOU CANNOT TAKE CARE OF ANOTHER PERSON. YOU CANNOT LOVE ANOTHER PERSON. SO SELF-LOVE, SELF-PROTECTION IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE LOVE AND PROTECTION OF ANOTHER PERSON. - WHEN YOU'RE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS, THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO BE GOOD. SO, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I TRAIN EXECUTIVE LEADERS FOR LEADERSHIP AND BUSINESS SKILLS. I TELL THEM, "PURSUE EXCELLENCE AND IGNORE SUCCESS," BECAUSE IF YOU PURSUE SUCCESS, THEN YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL GO INTO STRESS RESPONSE. WHEN YOU PURSUE EXCELLENCE, YOUR WHOLE BODY WILL GO INTO JOY. AND THE SUCCESS IS GUARANTEED. IF I'M WALKING FROM HERE TO THERE, I SHOULDN'T BE ALWAYS LOOKING THERE. I'LL STUMBLE. I SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF MY WALKING. IF I'M STUDYING FOR AN EXAM, I SHOULDN'T BE THINKING OF THE RESULTS OF THE TEST. I SHOULD BE STUDYING, OKAY? THAT'S MINDFULNESS, OKAY? AND THAT GUARANTEES SUCCESS, BUT YOU'RE NOT ATTACHED TO IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT COMES FROM WITHIN. YOU SEE, PEOPLE WHO ARE ATTACHED THINK THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE THAT IS THE SOURCE OF THEIR SUCCESS OR WHATEVER HAPPINESS. BUT HAPPINESS, SUCCESS, ALL THESE THINGS THAT HUMAN BEINGS PURSUE, THE SOURCE IS WITHIN YOURSELF. - THIS IS TRAINING, TRAINING TO REMEMBER, THAT IN US, THERE IS THAT... THAT ABILITY TO BE VERY PEACEFUL, VERY UNDERSTANDING, VERY LOVING. BUT WITH THE BUSY LIFE AND ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE SURROUND BY VERY NEGATIVE CONDITION, WE ARE EASILY IRRITATE. AND WHEN WE ARE IRRITATE, WE ARE LIKE, UH, UH, UH, A POND OF WATER... VERY TURBULENT. AND YOU DO NOT SEE ANYTHING CLEAR. AND THEN THE PRACTICE IS TO RESTORE THE STILLNESS OF THE WATER IN YOU... THE PEACE IN YOU. AND WHEN YOU SEE, YOU ARE MORE LIMPID, MORE CLEAR IN YOUR MIND. YOU SEE THING IN TOTALITY. AND YOU SHOULD SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOUR... YOUR MIND IS AGITATE, YOU LOOK AT THE MOON AND YOU ONLY SEE A LITTLE PIECE. BUT WHEN YOUR MIND IS FULL, IS STILL, YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE TOTALITY OF THE FULL MOON. - THE DOG MINDFULNESS IS HELPING US, BUT OUR LACK OF BEING MINDFUL IS HURTING THEM. - SO THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE WORLD WILL CONDEMN SOMEBODY... DO YOU REMEMBER THE STORY OF JESUS? HE WAS CONDEMNED, TOO. NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE WORLD CONDEMNS THE MAN, UH, OPEN YOUR HEART TO WHAT THAT MAN IS SAYING. THERE MIGHT BE A MESSAGE THERE. - WHAT'S DIFFICULT IS FOR THE PSYCHIATRIST WHO'S GOT 15 MINUTES TO WRITE A PRESCRIPTION... IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO INTEGRATE MINDFULNESS INTO THOSE PRACTICES. FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A FULL HOUR, THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THIS. BUT THE IRONY OR THE SILLINESS TO THIS IS THAT A PRESCRIPTION THAT I GIVE YOU, THAT I WRITE AND I CAN WRITE EVERY MONTH, YOU TAKE IT ONCE A DAY, COMES WITH SIDE EFFECTS, COSTS YOU, COSTS THE INSURANCE COMPANY. MINDFULNESS... AND I SOMETIMES DO THIS. I'LL TAKE UP MY PRESCRIPTION PAD, AND I'LL SAY, "YOU NEED TO GIVE ME SOMETHING FOR ANXIETY." SO I SAY, "I'VE GOT JUST THE THING FOR YOU," AND I'LL WRITE THIS... "MINDFULNESS, TAKE DAILY AS NEEDED. MAY REPEAT AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT." AND THEN I'LL TAKE OUT THIS AND I'LL HAND IT TO THEM, AND THEY'LL LOOK AT ME AS IF I'M CRAZY. I'LL SAY, "THIS IS THE WAY OUT FOR YOU." - YOU ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU SUFFER VERY DEEPLY. THERE IS A WAY TO SUFFER THAT CAN BRING RELIEF, AND EVERYONE WANTS TO LEARN HOW TO SUFFER LIKE THAT IN ORDER NOT TO SUFFER. AND IT'S... THE PRACTICE IS VERY CLEAR. DON'T BE AFRAID OF YOUR SUFFERING. BE WITH IT. UH, TAKE ONE DEEP BREATH, COME BACK TO YOURSELF, AND RECOGNIZE THE SUFFERING AND TRY TO HAND... TO HOLD IT DEARLY. YOU CAN DO THAT BECAUSE, WHILE YOU ARE BREAKING IN MINDFULLY, YOU GENERATE THE ENERGY OF MINDFULNESS. AND IT IS EXACTLY WITH THAT ENERGY OF MINDFULNESS THAT YOU CAN RECOGNIZE AND EMBRACE YOUR SUFFERING. OTHERWISE, YOU ARE OVERWHELMED BY YOUR SUFFERING. THE PRACTICE OF MINDFUL BREATHING, THE PRACTICE OF MINDFUL WALKING HELP GENERATE THAT ENERGY OF MINDFULNESS. WITHOUT THAT MINDFULNESS, YOU ARE OVERWHELMED BY YOUR SUFFERING. WITH THAT MINDFULNESS, YOU ARE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE YOUR SUFFERING, EMBRACE IT, AND BE PEACE... BE AT PEACE WITH IT. AND THAT IS THE... HOW YOU LEARN HOW TO SUFFER. - NOW, AT GALLUP, WE'VE DONE STUDIES... I'M PART OF GALLUP ORGANIZATION... THAT, IF YOU HAVE A HAPPY FRIEND, YOUR HAPPINESS GOES UP BY 15%. IF YOU HAVE A HAPPY FRIEND WHO HAS A HAPPY FRIEND, IT GOES UP ANOTHER 10%. AND IF THE HAPPY FRIEND'S HAPPY FRIEND HAS A HAPPY FRIEND, IT GOES UP AGAIN INCREMENTALLY. SO, YOU KNOW, YOUR HAPPINESS IS DEPENDENT ON THE HAPPINESS OF OTHERS. AND WE ARE ALL ENTANGLED. WE ARE ENTANGLED HORIZONTALLY NOW, UH, NOT ONLY THROUGH RELATIONSHIPS BUT THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORKS... YOU KNOW, TWITTER, FACEBOOK, THIS, THAT, AND THE OTHER. THE OTHER DAY, SOMEBODY ASKED ME ON TWITTER, "HOW DO I FIND THE RIGHT PERSON?" AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST TWEETED BACK. I SAID, "INSTEAD OF FINDING THE RIGHT PERSON, BECOME THE RIGHT PERSON." NOW, WITHIN 5 MINUTES, PEOPLE STARTED RETWEETING IT. AND IN 5 HOURS, 5 MILLION PEOPLE WERE PASSING ON THE MESSAGE. SO, YOU KNOW, OUR EMOTIONS ARE CONTAGIOUS... OUR THOUGHTS, OUR INSIGHTS... AND THESE NETWORKS ARE TAKING THAT MIND AND PROVING WHAT THE BUDDAH SAID, THAT THERE IS NO SEPARATE SELF. AND NOT ONLY IS THERE NO SEPARATE SELF HORIZONTALLY BUT VERTICALLY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOUR MIND IS INFLUENCED BY THE CULTURAL MIND THAT GOES BACK MILLIONS OF YEARS. SO, VERTICALLY, WE... WE... WE EXCHANGE MEANING THROUGH EACH OTHER HORIZONTALLY THROUGH RELATIONSHIPS AND, THESE DAYS, THROUGH SOCIAL NETWORKS, BUT VERTICALLY THROUGH CULTURE AND HISTORY. IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU GO DEEP ENOUGH, YOUR MIND IS ALL MINDS EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME. - BUT IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO BE CAREFUL AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF YOUR COMPASSION... THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT QUALITY PEOPLE. AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CHOOSE TO BE LOST EACH AND EVERY DAY. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE... DON'T... IF YOU KEEP GIVING THEM YOUR LOVE, THEY'RE NOT GONNA "GET BETTER." THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE WHO WERE JUST HURT IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND, IF YOU LOVE THEM AND LOVE THEM AND LOVE THEM, YOU'RE GONNA FIX THEM. AND SO, IF YOU JUST KEEP BEING COMPASSIONATE AND LOVING AND THEY KEEP BEING MEAN AND ABUSIVE, YOUR COMPASSION IS GONNA MAKE THEM BETTER. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WAKE UP EVERY DAY, AND THEY'RE LOST ON PURPOSE. AND IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO BE MINDFUL OF YOURSELF AND TO OBSERVE PEOPLE WITH THOUGHTFUL MINDFULNESS... MINDFUL OF YOURSELF, MINDFUL OF THEM. AND BE AWARE IF THAT PERSON IS CHOOSING TO BE LOST EVERY DAY. - THE WORLD LOVES DOGS, BUT IT BEHAVES LIKE A CAT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO WHEN IT COMES TO... WHEN YOU SEE BEHAVIOR... AND YOU HAVE TO EXCUSE THE CAT BECAUSE THE CAT WAS PROGRAMMED THAT WAY. THE HUMAN IS NOT PROGRAMMED TO BE SELFISH. THE HUMAN IS PROGRAMMED TO BE PACK-ORIENTED. BUT WHEN THERE'S MONEY INVOLVED, AND THEN IT BECOMES SINGLE-ORIENTED. WHAT EVERYONE WANTS IS TRUST, RESPECT, AND LOVE. BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT. ARE YOU GIVING IT? THAT'S THE QUESTION. [ BELL TOLLS ] - THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO... WHO... WHO JUST DO THAT. THEY DON'T NEED ANOTHER PERSON TO TELL THEM. THEY HAVE LEARNED FROM THEIR OWN, UH, SUFFERING. THEY KNOW THAT, UH, THEY WASTE THEIR LIFE IF THEY LIVE, UM, WITHOUT MINDFULNESS. AND THE OPPOSITE OF MINDFULNESS IS FORGETFULNESS. YOU LIVE IN FORGETFULNESS. YOU LIVE LIKE A ROBOT. YOU ARE ON, UH, AUTOMATIC, UM... PILOT. AND THERE ARE THOSE OF US, UH, WHO NEED A FRIEND IN ORDER TO LEARN HOW TO LIVE MINDFULLY BY WATCHING THAT FRIEND, UH, WALKING, SITTING, DRINKING HIS TEA... UH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. UH, EVERYONE HAS, UH, THE CAPACITY OF BEING MINDFUL. UH, YOU CAN DRINK YOUR TEA MINDFULLY. YOU CAN DRIVE YOUR CAR MINDFULLY. ONLY YOUR MINDFULNESS LASTS JUST 1 OR 2 SECONDS. SO IF YOU TRAIN YOURSELF... AND THEN YOU CAN, UH, BE MINDFUL FOR LONGER TIMES. AND WHEN YOU ARE MINDFUL, YOU ENJOY MORE. AND, UH, YOU ARE TRULY THERE. AND YOU LIVE MORE DEEPLY EVERY MOMENT OF YOUR DAILY LIFE. AND THAT'S NOT HARD... HARD WORK. THAT'S VERY PLEASANT. - SO SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT MINDFULNESS IS, UM, IDENTIFIED WITH BEING A HIPPIE, WITH BURNING MAN, WITH SITTING AROUND SINGING "KUMBAYA," UM, YOU KNOW, UH, SMOKING A LITTLE PEYOTE. WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S LIKE THIS REALLY ALTERNATIVE PRACTICE. BUT, IN REALITY, MINDFULNESS IS BEING PRACTICED, UM, IN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS, UM, AT ALL THE MAJOR UNIVERSITIES. AND A LOT OF, UH, THERAPISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE DOING IT THEMSELVES, ALTHOUGH YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT. AND A LOT OF, UM, PEOPLE WHO ARE, UM, SERIOUS MEMBERS OF SOCIETY THAT WOULD... VERY RESPECTED WHO WOULDN'T BE, UH, CONNECTED WITH A DESERT-DWELLING, PEYOTE-SMOKING HIPPIE IS... ARE DOING MINDFULNESS. - IT'S A RECKONING WITH YOURSELF EVERY DAY, WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A SOLITUDE, AND A SOLITUDE THAT'S DISCIPLINED IN THE SENSE THAT YOU HAVE TO... WHEN YOU... WHEN YOU WANDER OFF INTO THE CLOUDS OF THOUGHTS THAT YOU HAVE, YOU GENTLY RETURN TO THE CENTER. - EVERYONE CAN DO IT. UM, A BUDDHIST CAN DO IT. A NON-BUDDHIST CAN DO IT... A CHRISTIAN, A JEW, A COMMUNIST. EVERYONE CAN DO IT. - LIFE IS SIMPLE. WE MAKE IT COMPLICATED. - I THINK, IF YOU START WITH, SAY, MINDFUL AWARENESS OF BREATH AS A LIFESTYLE, IT SOON BECOMES A MEDITATIVE EXPERIENCE LIVING. - THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT IS TO PRACTICE. AND IT IS TRUE, LIKE WITH ANY OTHER SKILL, WITH ANY OTHER PRACTICE, THAT THE MORE YOU DO IT, THE BETTER YOU GET AT IT AND THE MORE EFFICIENT IT BECOMES AND THE EASIER IT IS TO DO. - NO MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION IN THE WORLD, YOU CAN BREATHE THROUGH IT. - AND THE BREATH IS THE LINK BETWEEN THE BODY AND THE MIND. AND THANKS TO THE BREATH, YOU GO BACK, AND YOU PAY ATTENTION ONLY TO THE IN-BREATH... THE AIR WHICH IS ENTERING INTO YOUR LUNG. AND YOU'RE CALM, BREATHING OUT. YOU'RE RELAXED. YOU'RE CALM. YOU'RE RELAXED WHEN YOU DO IT FOR A WHILE. AND THEN YOU TOUCH SLOWLY YOUR PEACE. AND WHEN YOU HAVE THAT PEACE, YOU START TO THINK. AND YOU START TO SPEAK OR ACT. SO THAT IS THE KEY POINT FOR THOSE WHO PRACTICE MINDFULNESS. - THE BREATHING IN SHOULD BE PLEASANT. IF, UH, YOU DON'T FEEL PLEASURE WHEN YOU BREATHE IN... YOU BREATHE IN, YOU ARE NOT REALLY PRACTICING CORRECTLY. UH, IN THE BEGINNING, YOU MIGHT JUST, UH, FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION TO YOUR IN-BREATH. YOUR IN-BREATH MIGHT BE SHORT, NOT REALLY PEACEFUL, BUT YOU ALLOW IT TO BE LIKE THAT. YOU JUST ALLOW YOURSELF TO BREATHE IN AND TO BECOME AWARE OF YOUR IN-BREATH. AND IF YOU CONTINUE LIKE THAT, YOUR IN-BREATH AND OUT-BREATH WILL BECOME, UH, DEEPER, MORE HARMONIOUS, MORE PEACEFUL BY ITSELF ALONE. THAT IS THE MIRACLE OF THE PRACTICE. AND WHEN YOUR IN-BREATH AND OUT-BREATH HAS BECOME A LITTLE BIT DEEPER, SLOWER, MORE PEACEFUL, UH, YOUR BODY WILL PROFIT FROM IT. THE STRESS, THE TENSION IN YOUR B... BODY WILL BE REDUCED BECAUSE YOU WILL KNOW YOU KNOW HOW TO BREATHE IN PEACEFULLY AND, UH, WITH HARMONY. AND ALSO, EVEN IF YOU HAVE A PAINFUL FEELING, UH, A PAINFUL EMOTION WITHIN YOURSELF, AND, UH, MINDFUL BREATHING, THE PEACEFUL BREATHING, WILL HELP YOU TO SUFFER LESS RIGHT AWAY. - WHEN I WAKE UP, I TRAIN MYSELF TO SEE THAT, "AH, I HAVE 24 HOUR TO LIVE DEEPLY." IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT MY DAY IS ONLY WONDERFUL. I HAVE MANY STRESSFUL THINGS TO DO. BUT I SAY THAT I VOW TO MAKE MY DAYS MORE RELAXING, EVEN I HAVE A LOT OF... OF, UH, EXPIRING DATE, UH, PROJECT TO FINISH. BUT I HAVE TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO REMIND MYSELF. THAT IS THE FIRST ACT. THEN, I... I... I GO START TO STAND UP AND WALK. AND I WALK MINDFULLY. THAT TAKES TRAINING. IT'S NOT EASY. - I DON'T SEE A DOG AS A STUDENT. I SEE A DOG AS A TEACHER. WHAT THE HUMAN HAVE TO DO IS TO HUMBLE HIMSELF AND LEARN FROM AN ANIMAL. 'CAUSE A HUMAN ALWAYS WANT TO TEACH THE ANIMAL. - FOR A BUSINESSMAN WALKING FROM ONE BUILDING TO ANOTHER, UH, HE MIGHT ENJOY EVERY STEP HE MAKE. UH, HE HAS TO MAKE A DECISION, OF COURSE. BUT WHILE WALKING, HE... HE MIGHT LIKE TO ENJOY EVERY STEP THAT HE MAKES. AND IF HE GET, UM, THE PEACE, THE JOY WHILE WALKING, WHEN HE ARRIVE, HE IS FRESH, AND HE CAN MAKE A BETTER DECISION. - QUIET DOESN'T MEAN CALM. HE'S SITTING DOWN, WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE INTERPRET AS HE'S CALM... NO. QUIET AND CALM IS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY, "I AM CALM, CESAR." THEY'RE QUIET. THIS IS CALM. NOT CALM. CALM. - WITH MINDFULNESS PRACTICE AND MEDITATION, YOU CAN TURN ON THE GOOD GENES AND TURN OFF THE BAD GENES. THERE ARE ABOUT 500 GENES, 400 TO 500 GENES, THAT INFLUENCE THINGS LIKE INFLAMMATION, UM, AUTOIMMUNE ILLNESSES, HEART DISEASE, AND CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER. WITHIN 4 MONTHS, YOU CAN TURN ON THE GOOD ONES AND TURN OFF THE BAD ONES, UH, THROUGH THE FOLLOWING THINGS... GOOD SLEEP, MEDITATION, MINDFULNESS, EXERCISE, HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS, AND A REASONABLY GOOD DIET, WHICH MEANS NOT EATING ANYTHING THAT COMES IN A CAN OR HAS A LABEL. SO THAT IS GENETIC INDETERMINISM, WHICH MEANS REGULATING YOUR OWN GENES, AND THEN NEUROPLASTICITY... WHEN YOU CHANGE YOUR BRAIN STRUCTURE THROUGH MINDFUL PRACTICES, YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE GENES. YOU KNOW, WHEN NEURONS THAT FIRE TOGETHER WIRE TOGETHER, YOU'RE LAYING DOWN NEW PROTEINS. IN ORDER TO LAY DOWN NEW PROTEINS, YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH DNA. YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH WHAT IS CALLED TRANSCRIPTION AND TRANSLATION. SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY TURNING ON GENES TO DO THAT. - I HAVE SAID THAT, UH, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LEARN FROM... FROM THEMSELVES, FROM THEIR OWN SUFFERING, AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO CAN LEARN FROM A FRIEND, FROM A TEACHER. WE HAVE TO LEARN THERE ARE THOSE WHO READ BOOKS AND KNOW HOW TO READ BY THEMSELVES. THERE ARE THOSE WHO NEED TO GO TO A TEACHER, UH, TO A GROUP OF FRIENDS. WE HAVE TO LEARN. AND THE BEST THING YOU MIGHT OFFER... BEST GIFT YOU CAN MAKE TO A FRIEND MIGHT BE TO TELL HIM OR TO TELL HER HOW TO LIVE, UH, HIS OR HER LIFE MORE DEEPLY, MORE MINDFULLY. UH, BUT, UH, YOU CANNOT DO THAT UNLESS YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT. YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO... TO LIVE, UH, YOUR LIFE MINDFULLY. UH, YOU HAVE TO... YOU... YOU... YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY OF ARRIVING IN THE HERE AND THE NOW, FEELING AT HOME IN THE HERE AND THE NOW BEFORE YOU CAN HELP ANOTHER PERSON. AND ONE PERSON LIVING LIKE THAT CAN HELP SO MANY PEOPLE. [ BELL TOLLS ] - SO, HOW DO WE THEN BEGIN TO INTEGRATE MINDFULNESS? I THINK THERE HAS TO BE A POINT AT WHICH YOU SAY, "WHAT I'M DOING ISN'T WORKING FOR ME. THE OTHER SOLUTIONS, TALKING TO MY FRIENDS, ISN'T WORKING FOR ME," IF IT ISN'T. "AND SO I NOW NEED TO DO SOMETHING ELSE." THE PROBLEM IS THAT, FOR A LOT OF WESTERNERS, THEY ARE SO USED TO VERY RAPID RESULTS, WHERE EVERYTHING IS, UH... "I WANT THIS NOW." UM, THE PRACTICE OF MINDFULNESS CAN SOMETIMES TAKE MUCH LONGER THAN A PILL DOES. SO CERTAINLY, A LINE OF COCAINE OR A LINE OF... OR A SHOT OF HEROIN OR... OR A DRUG, UM, IS GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER MUCH QUICKER. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THOUGH, IS THAT THE AFTERMATH OF THAT LINE OF COCAINE AND THE HEROIN IS TREMENDOUS UNHAPPINESS. SO IT'S A SHORT-TERM SOLUTION TO A LONG-TERM PROBLEM. - IT'S BIOLOGICALLY INGRAINED IN US TO... TO LIVE IN A WAY THAT IS THE... OF THE LEAST RESISTANCE, THE WAY THAT IS EASIEST AND ALSO JUST SAFEST, LIKE OUR ANCESTORS, ANIMALS, FIRST HUMAN BEINGS WHEN THEY LIVED IN A CAVE. THEY HAD... THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS TO SURVIVE, TO BE SAFE. SO WE DEVELOPED INSTINCTS THAT HELPED US. IF WE HEAR A NOISE, WE WILL, YOU KNOW... WE WILL HAVE A FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT RESPONSE IMMEDIATELY. OR WE SEE SOMETHING, WE IMMEDIATELY CATEGORIZE IT SO THAT WE CAN MAKE A VERY QUICK DECISION WHETHER IT IS SOMETHING SAFE OR SOMETHING UNSAFE. SO THAT WAS DEVELOPED VERY EARLY IN OUR HISTORY AS LIVING BEINGS. AND SO THAT'S MUCH MORE INGRAINED. THE CAPACITY TO BE AWARE, THE CAPACITY TO RECOGNIZE, TO... TO... TO... THOSE ARE MUCH MORE DEVELOPED, AND THEY HAVE... THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED MUCH LATER IN OUR HISTORY, ESPECIALLY THE EVOLUTIONARY OF HUMAN BEINGS, OF THE HOMO SAPIENS. SO WHEN WE HAVE THE... THE BRAIN, THE CORTEX DEVELOPED, THAT'S A COURSE OF OUR CAPACITY, LIKE MINDFULNESS, AWARENESS, COMPASSION, ALTRUISM. BUT THOSE ARE DEVELOPED MUCH LATER. SO, FOR US, WE LIVE WITH OUR INSTINCTS. AND THAT'S EASIER. AND IT'S QUICKER. WE CAN MAKE A QUICK DECISION, AND THAT'S WHY I WAS SHARING LATER THAT LIFE CAN BE VERY MONOTONOUS BECAUSE WE LOOK AT SOMETHING, WE MEET IT, WE MAKE A CONCLUSION... "OH, IT'S A TREE, IT'S AN ANIMAL, IT'S THAT, YOU KNOW, FRIEND, OR THAT'S MY WIFE OR SOMETHING." AND WE MAKE THAT DECISION IMMEDIATELY. AND, SO, THEN IT IS OVER. THE BRAIN DOESN'T PROCESS ANYMORE. WE DON'T SEE THE SITUATION, THE PERSON ANYMORE. AND THE BRAIN SHUTS DOWN AND LOOK FOR ANOTHER NEW STIMULUS. YOU SEE? BUT LEARNING TO BE MINDFUL, IT TAKES MORE WORK BECAUSE IT TAKES US TO STILL THE MIND, TO QUIET THE MIND, SO THAT THE BRAIN DOESN'T JUST MAKE A TOP-DOWN CONTROL, A TOP-DOWN DECISION TO SAY, "THAT IS THAT." BUT WE KEEP THE MIND QUIET SO THAT WE CONTINUE TO PROCESS THAT STIMULUS, THAT PERSON. THAT... THAT MAY BE OUR WIFE, OUR CHILDREN, OURSELVES, OUR FEELINGS, OUR BODY. THE BRAIN CONTINUES TO BE IN TOUCH WITH THAT IN A NEW WAY WE CALL THE BEGINNER'S MIND. WE ARE IN TOUCH WITH IT... NEW EVERY MOMENT. AND IT IS A MENTAL TRAINING. WE HAVE THAT CAPACITY WITHIN US. BUT THE OUTER CAPACITY OF, YOU KNOW, RELYING ON OUR INSTINCTS, THAT'S MUCH MORE INGRAINED AND MUCH EASIER AND QUICKER. - PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BAMBOOZLED AND HYPNOTIZED INTO HARD WORK, EXACTING PLANS, DRIVING AMBITION, WHICH IS THE PERFECT RECIPE FOR FAILURE. OKAY, IT'S PART OF THE... WHAT DO YOU CALL IT? JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ETHIC... WORK HARD, MAKE PLANS, UM, BE AMBITIOUS, BEAT THE OTHER GUY, ET CETERA. AND IT'S THE PERFECT, UH, RECIPE FOR FAILURE BECAUSE, EVEN WHEN YOU GET THERE, YOU WON'T BE A HAPPY PERSON. - BUT IT'S AN EXPLANATION OF, "WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAPPINESS AND PLEASURE?" AND YOU KNOW, PLEASURE IS THE THING THAT YOU DO, AND YOU GET IT RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE... AND IT'S ALL GREAT RIGHT THAT SECOND. AND HAPPINESS IS THE CHOICE THAT YOU MAKE THAT SUSTAINS. AND I REALLY THINK IT GETS REALLY SIMPLE TO PICK, YOU KNOW? IF I HAVE THREE MARTINIS, I'M GONNA GET A GREAT, BIG BUZZ, AND I'M GONNA FEEL REALLY CRAPPY TOMORROW. IF I DON'T HAVE THREE MARTINIS BUT I SIT WITH MY FRIENDS AND DO THE MINDFUL THING, I'M GONNA HAVE A LOT OF FUN RIGHT NOW, AND I'M GONNA HAVE A LOT OF FUN TOMORROW. - MY MIND IS WITH MY STEP. AND THEN WHEN I ENTER INTO THE WASHROOM, I OPEN THE WATER TAP TO CLEAN MY FACE, BUT MY MIND IS WITH THE WATER TAP. AND WHEN I OPEN THE WATER, I SEE THE WATER. AND THEN, SOMETIMES, MY MIND IS SO DEEP THAT I SEE SOMETHING THAT... USUALLY, IF MY MIND IS NOT THERE, I DO NOT SEE, LIKE, THE WATER. OUR ANCESTOR DO NOT HAVE WATER IN OUR WASHROOM LIKE THAT. THEY HAVE TO GO FAR AND PICK UP THE WATER. AND IN SOME AREA, THEY ARE SO... VERY LITTLE WATER. AND... AND HERE, THE WATER FLOW CLEAN. AND I ONLY SWITCH THE WATER TAP. IN THE LEFT SIDE, IT WILL BE COLD WATER. IN THE RIGHT SIDE, WILL BE HOT WATER. AND IT'S SO WONDERFUL. AND SO I FEEL THAT, "OH, ALL IN THE WISDOM OF MANY GENERATION... OF PREVIOUS GENERATION, THE PLUMBER, THE ENGINEER TO MAKE... TO BRING THAT WONDERFUL WATER." HOT WATER IN THE COLD WINTER I HAVE SO WARM. HOT WATER IS... I CANNOT TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. WHEN I SEE DEEPLY LIKE THAT, I'M SO HAPPY. - THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT MINDFULNESS IS A CLEANER, SIDE-EFFECT-FREE WAY TO LONGER-TERM MENTAL HEALTH, STABILITY, WAY OF BEING THAN ANY OF THESE OTHER SHORT-TERM SOLUTIONS THAT COME WITH SIDE EFFECTS. - YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR GREATNESS. YOU'RE A FIELD OF INFINITE POSSIBILITIES. YOUR INTENTIONS ARE VERY POWERFUL. YOU HAVE INFINITE CREATIVITY. AND YOU'RE CONNECTED TO ALL THAT EXISTS, NOT ONLY NOW, BUT IN THE PAST AND IN THE FUTURE. YOU ARE THE IMMEASURABLE POTENTIAL OF ALL THAT WAS, ALL THAT IS, AND ALL THAT WILL EVER BE. - ♪ EVERY MORNING, WHEN I WAKE UP ♪ ♪ HMM ♪ I AM HAPPY - LIFE IS A MIRACLE. WHEN YOU BREATHE IN MINDFULLY, YOU MIGHT GET INSIGHT THAT YOU ARE ALIVE... STILL ALIVE. AND TO SEE THAT YOU ARE ALIVE IS ONLY A MIRACLE. A PERSON WHO IS ALREADY DEAD CANNOT BREATHE IN ANYMORE, CANNOT TAKE ANOTHER STEP ANYMORE. SO WHEN YOU BREATHE IN MINDFULLY OR WHEN YOU MAKE A STEP MINDFULLY, YOU REALIZE THE MIRACLE OF BEING ALIVE. AND THAT MIRACLE CAN HAPPEN IN EVERY MOMENT. [ BELL TOLLS ] ♪♪ [ BELL TOLLS ]
