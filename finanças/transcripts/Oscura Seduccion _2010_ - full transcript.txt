DARK SEDUCTION - Who's next? - The lady at the back. Okay, thanks. Penelope Ruiz? Let's see. Do you want my honest opinion? There is nothing wrong with your breasts. They're perfect. No, Doctor, look, this breast is a bit lower. Penelope, if I had your body, I'd never let a scalpel touch me. - Excuse me, Doctor. - Yes. - I should have knocked. - Yes. - Here is the file. - Leave it there, please. Thank you. So will you do the surgery, Doctor? What can I say, Penelope? It's your body. If that's what you want, I'll be glad to perform the surgery. And since I'm going into the operating room anyway, how about removing some fat from here? You know, where we tend to gain. If your boyfriend will pay for it, that's what we're here for. - Are you studying? - Yes. It's my first year of medical school. So our assistant will be a doctor. - I have to pay for my studies. - Sure. I'm Laura. Dr. Laura. - I should have introduced myself. Sorry. - Nice to meet you. - Don't worry. You were with a patient. - What's your name? - Gustavo Munoz. - Wei I. - I like your bracelet. - Thanks. My grandma gave it to me. - It's very nice. - Thank you. Now that we know each other a Hittite better, can I ask you a question? It's a bit improper. Wei I, not improper, it's personal. A personal question. - Of course. - Are you gay? Why are you asking me that? Is it because of the bracelet? No, because you waked into my office and didn't even look at the patient, who was nude. No, look. I'm straight, I love women. But your patient wasn't my type. I see. What is your type? I like women who are interesting and independent. Women like you, for example. Interesting. Although looks can be deceiving. If you’d excuse me. So are you going to do the operation? What else can I do? You taught me that the client is always right. Yes, but there are some Limits, Laura. It is amazing how women get addicted to plastic surgery. Once they start, they can't stop. You should see her body. It's ridiculous. I would give anything, All I have, for a body like that. Your body is beautiful. How do you know? That's the image in your mind. That's fine, keep thinking like that. But it's actuality far from perfect. I'd like to do a full exploration to give an informed opinion. Yeah, sure. When will you find the woman you deserve? I already found her, but she won't make up her mind. We've discussed that a thousand times. What will I do 15 years from now, when you're an old man? I don't know, give me some Viagra for my birthday. First I'll show you these pictures so you can choose what you want. The bigger the implant, the more expensive it is. Don't worry about the money. I have a very good friend who will pay for it. Come in. - Excuse me, Doctor. - Yes. - Here is your agenda. - Thank you. Gustavo? Gustavito? I'm Carmen, Leonor's daughter. Carmen, of course. How are you? Sorry, I didn't recognize you. You look competency different. - Do I look different? - Yes, you do. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - So you work here? - Yes, I started two weeks ago. - That's great! - Thanks, I'm doing well. - Can we meet and talk later? - Of course. - I finish around 4:00 p.m. - Sure. See you later. - Goodbye. - Excuse me, Doctor. Of course. How about the 26th? - Can you make it at 5:00 p.m.? - Yes. Perfect. Have you known Gustavo for a long time? - Excuse me? - Have you known Gustavo for long? We were next-door neighbors for many years. - Doctor. - Yes? Shall I walk with you? There's no need, I live nearby. Excuse me for insisting, but the other day a woman was attacked here. I didn't know that. Thank you. Excuse me for asking, but how long ago did you graduate from med school? Are you trying to guess my age? No, it's just that I'd like to have my own clinic, like you. It takes some time, Gustavo. Time and a lot of sacrifices. When I'm determined to do something, I go all the way. No matter how great the sacrifices. That's great, I'm happy for you. Thank you. It was my pleasure, Doctor. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Happy 40th birthday. They're Improve. Thank you. You're welcome. Of course. Let me take you out to dinner tonight. You decide where. No, I can't. I already have plans. Maybe some other time. - Have a good time. Happy birthday. - Thank you. - Aren't you going to blow out the candles? - Yes! But I want to make a wish first. Yes. Done. One, two, three. You can't tell. They look fantastic. Excuse me one second. - Hello? - Happy birthday, gorgeous. The only person who didn't wish me a happy birthday today. Hello. I'm really busy at the hospital, I don't think I can make it for dinner. Do you mind if we leave it for tomorrow? No, Eduardo. Just don't let any patients die on you. - Gustavo. - Doctor. I was wondering if your invitation still stands. Of course. I never knew my parents. Perhaps that's why I don't really miss them. Of course, I'd give anything to have them by my side. And your grandmother? How long since she passed away? It'll be two years next week. I miss her a lot. I can imagine. Did I tell you she was Spanish? Her grandfather was a famous general. No, I didn't know that. How interesting. It's a very long story. I'll tell you about it when we have more time. - Do you have a family? - Yes. My parents live in the provinces. My sister is a flight attendant, so obviously she travels a lot, but sometimes she stays with me. - She must be very pretty. - She is pretty. She has good genes. And do you have a girlfriend? Girls my age are irresponsible and immature. And the women I'm interested in are married or have kids. Your case is a strange exception. Do I look strange to you? Don't get me wrong. I mean it's difficult to find such a beautiful woman who is single. How come you never got married? Let's change the subject, okay? They're expensive, but they're worth it. You can borrow them if you like. - Really? - Of course. - Why not? - Thank you. You're welcome. I'll be glad to lend them to you. I like that you're making an effort, I like what you're doing. - I like it. - Thank you. Thank you very much. Aren't you going to invite me in? What made you think I'd invite you into my place? - Facts. - Which facts? We're both here. We're both free. I want to make love to you. And I know you won't regret it. No, Gustavo. I don't think this is a good idea at all. - Forgive me, Doctor. - It's all right. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Doctor? - Yes. Don't forget about the books. I won't forget. Good morning. Dr. Laura, you're here! Rosario. Doctor, I need to talk to you. - It's urgent. I need your help. - What happened? - Is something wrong? - Nothing much. This idiot says I don't have credit at your clinic. Rosario, you used up your guarantee. You ran out of credit. What can I do now, Doctor? How will I afford my other surgeries? Rosario, unfortunately we're not a finance company. You could... I promise I'll pay! If I don't have the operation I'll lose my job at the cabaret. You have no idea how many younger girls are ready to take my place. I'll die if I have to stop singing, Doctor. - Yes. - Doctor? Don't worry, Rosario. We'll find a solution. Please wait your turn. I'll be glad to help you then. - But, Doctor... - Rosario, you know you can't smoke in here. Yes. - Excuse me, Doctor. - Yes. I'd like to apologize for my behavior last night. Don't worry. It was my fault, too. Let's just forget it happened, okay? Thank you. Here are the documents you requested. Thank you. What's up, Doctor? I've been waiting for two hours. When will you see me? Can we talk later, Gustavo? - Yes. - Thank you. Step back! Don't come any closer! I swear I'll kill her! Shut up! Rosario, this won't make things better. Step back! Don't come any closer. Step back or I'll slit her throat. - Relax, Rosario. - Relax. What do you want? She refused to help me, so I want money. I need cash to pay another surgeon. - Bring my checkbook from my office. - No paper. - I want cash. - Step aside. - Go away! - Put your gun down! - Put it down. - Why? - Put it down. - Security, please put it down. - All right. - Leave me atone with them, please. Trust me, please. - Bring me the check. - Right away. But listen to me. Task fast. I don't have time for speeches. I know you're desperate. You're suffering in a body you hate. And you don't know who you are anymore. I've been through that. We've all suffered trying to figure out who we are. Calm down, please. The doctor promised to give you the check. - Who will do your surgery after this? - I'll find an underground surgeon. You know they're butchers. They'll ruin the doctor's good work. Your body is beautiful. Your face, your new identity. Are you just going to throw away what you wanted so much? Rosario, there's a solution for everything, except death. Please, give that to me. Please. Come with me, please. Take her outside, but don't call the police. Please let her go. Are you all right, Doctor? Yes. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Two days later, but that's okay. I finally managed to leave the hospital. But I hope this present will make up for everything. I love it! Thank you. It's so beautiful. I love it. Eduardo, you really shouldn’t have. In exchange, I'll accept a dinner here at your place. Let me think about it. Okay. It seems I have a competitor. And a strong one. Red roses, the symbol of passion. No, they're from a colleague. - A fellow surgeon? - No. A nurse. He's studying to become a doctor. "Youth, treasure only gods may keep..." Don't be a pain. He's just a coworker. Laura, young guys nowadays only give flowers like these when they want to sleep with a woman. So what if he wants to sleep with me? Is it illegal? Of course not, especially if the woman just turned 40, and feeling wanted by a 20-year-old is a wonderful present. Enough, Eduardo. I said he's a coworker. What are you trying to say? You're not 20 anymore, Laura. You can't afford to waste your time on flings with young boys when you're surrounded by mature, responsible, hard-working men - who share your interests, right? - Of course. There are also old and boring men who only think about their pension, going to the doctor and measuring their blood pressure every 20 minutes. But I still feel young and full of energy. I don't get it. What do you mean, you feel for the books? If I were the books and you were my owner, I'd never leave you. I almost forgot! - This is for you. - Thank you. I bought it for your birthday, but I forgot to take it to the clinic. What's this? Carmen. It's my grandma's favorite opera. It's classical music, but romantic, too. I thought you'd like it. You don't know how much I like it. - Really? - Of course. - Can I play it? - Of course. - But let me warn you. - What? This music is for when you're in love and the person you love feels the same. Do you know what I mean? Sometimes it can be so sad that it hurts. Do you listen to this a lot? Since I started to work at your clinic, Doctor. Gustavo, - can you do me a favor? - Sure. Don't be so formal with me. Where are you going? What time is it? I don't know. I have to go to the clinic. Don't go. You're the boss. - I know. - Just a little longer. - A little longer. - No! Don't you like it? Scalpel. How are you, Doctor? How are you? Good morning. - Hello. - Good morning. - May I sit next to you, Doctor? - Of course. Good evening. Good evening. Who is it, Eduardo? Hello. How are you? This is my friend Eduardo. This is Gustavo, the boy I told you about. My assistant. The medical student I'm helping. Yes, I remember. What are you going to specialize in? Plastic surgery? I don't know yet. I think I'll be off. I'll walk you to the door. Good luck with your studies. Who is that guy? Eduardo? I told you, he's a friend. I don't like him. He looks like a pervert. What are you talking about? Eduardo is a great guy. - You're sleeping with him, aren't you? - No! Why didn't you kiss me in front of him? Of course I kissed you. On the cheek. Do you think I'm stupid? Why didn't you kiss me on the lips? - You're ashamed of me. - What are you talking about? You're ashamed of your rich friends seeing you with a poor guy like me. I can't believe you're saying that. So why was he here with you atone? Are you jealous? I'm not jealous. - Yes, you are. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. - I told you I'm not jealous! Don't you ever yell at me again. Don't do that again. Let me say this very Carrier. I am not a slut. I don't go around looking to get laid. Eduardo has been my friend for ages, and he can come here whenever he wants. If you want to be with me, you'll have to get used to that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Why are you laughing? - Nothing, forget it. Why are you laughing? I was thinking of our fight, and I thought of the typical husbands in soap operas, always jealous. I lost my mind. My grandma used to love those characters. I don't know that kind of man because I'm single. - Due to stupidity. - Why do you say that? I gave up a great man for my job. For my career, my ambition. - Did he ask you to marry him? - Yes, in the third year of med school. I got pregnant. He wanted to marry me and start a family, but I found all that horrifying. Thinking of myself as a housewife and... It was like throwing all my work, my studies, my efforts in the garbage. So one day I had an abortion, and he never forgave me. You're still young, Laura. Seriously. Will you marry me? - Don't be silly. - I'm serious. - That's crazy. What are you talking about? - I'm serious. Or at least let me move in with you. I spend more time here than at home. I don't think it's a good idea, Gustavo. Why do you say that? Is our relationship just a fling? It's not that, it's just... I'm not ready for that. Give me some time, will you? - Yes. - Okay. Arms up. That's it. Excuse me for a minute. - Hello? - Doctor, this is Federico, your neighbor. Hello, Federico. Sorry to bother you, but something strange is going on. - What? - Someone's moving boxes into your place. Hello, my love. You're home early. - What's this? - What? - All this. - I'm sorry, darling. Who told you? The super? I knew it. He freaks out if he sees a little mess. Don't worry, your house will be as good as new in less than an hour. No, Gustavo, I mean you. We agreed you wouldn’t move in. Last night I understood... We talked about it the other night, and I said I'm not ready. I need time. - I understood something else. - What? That you wanted me to surprise you. When did I ever give you that impression? Gustavo, please answer me. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Just take your things and go home. I don't have a home. I have nowhere to live. What are you talking about? I lied to you. I don't have a home, Laura. My Ordinands asked me to leave two weeks ago, and with my tuition fees I don't have... I can't. Why didn't you say so before? You would have thought I just want a woman to support me financially. Of course not. And I was so naive I thought sooner or later you'd ask me to move in. That's why I asked you last night. I thought you'd be glad to come home and find me moved in here. But I see I was wrong. Don't worry, I'm leaving. Stop, Gustavo. You can stay with me. No, Laura, I don't want to bother you. You're not bothering me. You're a spoiled child. But promise me one thing. Never make another decision without asking me first. All right? I'm starving. - I'll cook something. Did you eat already? - No. Gustavo. Gustavo. What are you doing? - I'm waiting for my grandma. - Your grandmother? Come on, let's go to bed, okay? Do you think she'll be back soon? Yes. Let's go to bed, come on. No, Eduardo, his eyes were open. He even answered me. Laura, sleepwalkers open their eyes. Otherwise, they wouldn’t see where they walk. What did you expect? For him to walk with his arms extended and his eyes closed like in the cartoons? No, but it was very weird. I don't know how to explain it. It was scary. Don't be afraid. Calm down. Sleepwalkers are more likely to hurt themselves than someone else. - Although... No. - No, tell me, please. Go to sleep. All right. See you tomorrow. Thank you. - Did you have trouble sleeping? - No, why? I woke up and you weren't in bed. Yes, I got up to drink some water and then I watched TV. Gustavo, the truth is I looked for you and you were in the rocking chair singing some kind of lullaby. Is it the one your grandmother used to sing? Yes. It's pretty. What does it mean? Who is Mandru? His name is Mambru. I'm not sure. It's a Spanish lullaby. Mothers would sing it to their kids when their fathers went to war. And your grandfather was in the army, wasn't he? Yes, in the Blue Army during World War II. - You must be proud of him. - Yes, very much. And have you ever - hurt yourself when... - When I sleepwalk? - Yes. - No, never. - But there's something I want to do. - Really? - And I've never been able to. - What? - Make love while I sleepwalk. - No, wait. No, Gustavo. I'm late, really. Doctor. Not here. Seriously, no. I'm counting the hours. Why don't you round up the missing clients? How is my suicidal patient? I feel fine. But I'm so ashamed, Doctor. Don't worry, Rosario. We're human. Anyone can lose their mind at some point. Now you need to recover for your next procedure. Thank you, Doctor. There's something I want to tell you. - What is it? - The nurse who talked me out of it. - Gustavo. - That one. Last night he was here, looking at me. - Are you sure it was him? - Yes, Doctor. I thought he was working, but he disappeared as soon as the nurse on duty came. Hello, darling. I'm making dinner. Where is the painting Eduardo gave me? It was awful, so I gave it to the gardener. My grandma used to say that abstract paintings confuse the mind. Gustavo, your grandmother doesn't live with us. If you mention the word "grandma" again, you'd better take your things and leave. I'm going to see Eduardo. When I get back, I want to see the painting where it was. - So you're not going to eat here? - No, don't bother. Are you asleep? No. Thanks for returning my painting. Besides the fact that Eduardo gave it to me, I think it's a beautiful painting, I love it. It looks great in my living room. Thank you. You were with him, weren't you? I'm not going to argue now. I'm tired. I really need a bath. I haven't stopped liking him. I'm afraid of him. It's as if there were two men inside of him. One is kind, loving, cute, and the other is jealous, possessive, sick. I'm scared. I warned you. I told you it was too soon to let him into your life. Eduardo, I'm also scared of losing him. And I think he needs me. Laura, you're afraid to be atone. But you'll never be atone. You'll always have your old friend... Eduardo. How long are you going to take? I'm almost ready. They won't hold our reservation for more than 15 minutes. Don't you get tired of that music? No. - Never. - I do. Please, give that CD a break, will you? - I don't like that dress. - Really? - Well, I'm the one who's wearing it. - It's from that old man, isn't it? I'm not going to answer that. Change your clothes, or we won't go anywhere. What's wrong? Now you're telling me what I should wear, too? Laura, I didn't mention it to avoid an argument. But your clothes are more revealing every day and I don't like it. People will say you're a slut. How funny. I did it for you. I thought you liked seeing me look younger. I liked how you looked when I met you. So please take off that dress or we won't go anywhere. All right. I'll go by myself. Why are you doing this? Why are you treating me like this? - Don't I deserve some respect? - Why should you? Because you're mine. Gustavo, let me go. Let me go. Enough! You are a child, that's what you are. And you know what? I've had it. So please take your things and get out of my house by tomorrow. I'm not hungry, so there won't be any dinner. You can't do that to me, Laura. After all I've done for you. You can't kick me out of your house like that. The only thing you've done for me is bring trouble into my life. Enough. Just what I needed. A kid telling me what I should wear. - It's ridiculous. - You got bored with me. Let me go! Honestly, yes. I'm sick of your foolishness, of your childish jealousy and your lies. Yes, I'm sick of it. When will you understand that a relationship isn't just about sex? You still like it, don't you? You love having sex with me. What's wrong with you? Let me go! Don't come any closer! I swear I'll kill you. You're sick. Very sick. - I'll get back at you. - Police, I need help! Thank you. Why didn't you report it? What for? To make things worse? What if he comes back? Or if he goes to the clinic and attacks you? Don't be so dramatic, Eduardo. I'm not being dramatic. These guys start like this. Laura, tell me the truth. Is it the first time he's tried to rape you? I think so. What do you mean? I don't know. Sometimes he's very violent. I thought... I thought it was just part of a game. Do you realize he's never going to leave you atone? From tomorrow, you'll stay with me at my apartment. I don't think that's necessary. Laura, I'm serious about this. From tomorrow, you'll stay at my place. Or I'll come here and stay with you. And I'm not trying to take advantage of the situation. - Good morning. - Good morning, Doctor. When Gustavo comes in, please tell him he's fired. And could you take care of the paperwork, too? That won't be necessary. Gustavo quit this morning. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Dear Laura, I'm writing because I don't have the courage to face you after what happened last night. You can't imagine how sorry I am. But I can also imagine that you will never forgive me again. Sometimes the love we feel for a woman is so powerful that it blinds us. Even more when it involves a woman as special as you. That's why I have decided to quit the clinic and leave the city. I hope you will understand me. I am weak and I cannot stand being near you if you are not mine. Gustavo. Dear God, Eduardo, what happened? Did you have an accident? Someone wanted to play baseball with me. What? You were beaten with a bat? Why? Were you mugged? No, they didn't even touch my wallet. The worst is that I couldn’t see his face. But who could have done something like this? Your friend. Gustavo? Why would he do something like this? That's nonsense. As revenge, or out of jealousy. How should I know? I'm going to press charges against him. How are you going to press charges if you don't know it was him? I saw his bracelet, Laura. His silver bracelet. Eduardo, do you have any idea how many men wear bracelets like that? Especially young men. Besides, he just went to my office to resign and leave a letter of apology. You're out of your mind. And you believed him again? Laura, how long are you going to let him play with you? I thought you knew better than that. I'm not stupid. You're behaving as if you were. What if you're trying to get even with him for some reason? Don't be stupid, Laura. I already said I'm not stupid. Let me tell you something. If you press charges against him without any evidence, I swear I'll never speak to you again. We all make mistakes. Carmen? What are you doing here? How did you find my address? Carmen, I need to talk to you. It was in your file. - I have nothing to discuss with you. - Listen to me. I need your help. I promise I won't say anything to Gustavo. Help me. - Okay. - Thank you. How did you know each other? From the neighborhood. He told me his grandmother's story. But it wasn't really his grandmother. Who was it, then? When his parents died, she was a good friend of his mother's. She was happy to adopt him. That is how he came to live with her. I don't understand. It's simple, Doctor. She adopted him and they became lovers. They lived as husband and wife. My God. That's horrible. How old was Gustavo at the time? I don't know. I guess he was a teenager. Then people found out about it and she ran from the authorities. She went back to Spain and Gustavo was left atone. SLUT I WILL KILL YOU We'll do all we can to find him. But tomorrow you should file a report at the police station. I'll do that, Officer. We'll be watching, but she shouldn’t be atone tonight. Don't worry, I won't leave here until you catch that bastard. Very well. Good night. Thank you. Good night. You were right. He's very sick. He needs help. What that guy needs is to be put in prison before he goes too far. He looked so fragile. So vulnerable. Don't torture yourself. You became fond of him and he took advantage. But they are going to catch him, aren't they? I hate saying this, but just in case, I have a very good gun at my place. More sweat. Forceps. Thank you. What's wrong, Doctor? She's in cardiac arrest, Doctor. What's wrong, Doctor? She's in cardiac arrest. What's wrong, Doctor? The resuscitator. We're losing her, Doctor. Crash cart! Don't worry. We saved her. I can't understand what happened. What happened? The anesthesia device was tampered with. Someone broke the pressure valve on purpose. I'm sorry. That bastard won't catch me off-guard. Don't worry. Actually, I could use a bullet right now. So I could escape all this. What's that? When did it happen? A week ago. I didn't want to alarm you, but the patient's husband is suing me for malpractice. Do you know what the worst part is? I'm sure it was Gustavo. This is an absurd amount. They want to ruin you. I know. No, Laura, no. You're right, I'm stupid. I'm stupid. You're only stressed out because of that madman. Listen. You just need a vacation. Get away from all this for a while. Why don't we go to Cancun, or Europe? I can't. What about my clinic? - You can close for a while. - I can't do that. Many people depend on it. My patients, my employees. I would have to find another solution. Laura, what you have to do is worry about yourself for the first time in your life. Eduardo, you really scared me. I'm sorry, but I didn't want to wait until tomorrow. What's up? They caught Gustavo. The police just called. They caught him at the airport. The idiot bought a ticket in his own name. You know? I think you're right. Let's go on that trip. I want to go. So you're not going to wait for the police? They're bringing photos of the detainee. I don't even want to see a photo of Gustavo. In that case, I'll have the pleasure of identifying him. Put that thing away. You're going to shoot yourself in the behind. I'd rather shoot myself in the behind than be used for batting practice. Until I'm competency certain that Gustavo was arrested, my friend here will stay by my side. I'm off. I'm late. Don't forget your suitcase. - Whatever you say, boss. - Very good, you're learning. Laura? Aren't you gone yet? Laura? Hello, Doctor. The police are so effective. It seems I'm late. The doctor rushed out. Are you looking for this? Why don't you leave Laura atone once and for all? Doctor, have you ever felt abandoned? And without any hope of survival? I have. Just like my grandfather. When I was a child, my grandmother told me how he died in the Siege of Leningrad. Alone. Like a dog. Abandoned by his own comrades. Have you heard of the Blue Army? Of course not. Let me show you. The Blue Army were the patriots who fought against Hitler and communism. They were real heroes, Doctor. And my grandfather was one of them. But we seem to have forgotten them. I don't want to follow in my grandfather's footsteps. Do you understand? Don't worry, you won't suffer... Much. Doctor? Doctor? Open up. It's the police. Looks like nobody's home. Leave the papers here. Open up, old man. Don't worry. Sleep well. I'll be back for you. Hello, Penelope. - Doctor. - How are you? - It hurts a lot. - That's normal. It's normal, but you'll get better. You'll see. I wanted to tell you that you'll be my last patient for a while, so don't worry if it looks a bit deserted here. - Everything is all right. - Thank you, Doctor. I wanted to thank you, because I know my life will be very different after this procedure. Thank you, Doctor. Don't even mention it. Everything will be all right. I'll check on you in a couple of hours. - Doctor. - Yes? - The night nurse has come. - Great. Who's staying? - Marta. - Very well. - Enjoy your vacation. - Thank you. Penelope, it's Laura. I came to give you a small treatment and to see if everything is all right. I'm going to turn on the lights. This won't hurt. I'll remove your mask, but it may feel strange because your skin is so sensitive. Breathe deeply. It will be all right. Ready? Here I go. Laura, what took you so long? I was waiting for you. You woke up, my love. Let me go, please. Help! Don't worry, my love. What are you going to do to me? You'll look beautiful. Don't do it, Gustavo. Please, don't do it! Gustavo, don't do it! Listen to me. Calm down. Don't move. It will only hurt more. Please, give me an anesthetic. You want an anesthetic? Please, I beg you. What for? Carmen resisted the pain when her lover killed her at the end of the opera. I resisted the pain too when you kicked me out of your place and treated me like a dog.
