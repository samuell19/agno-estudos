Just listen. Táncsics was jailed because of this? For writing the truth? Yes. Because here too, it says... It's just Gyurka. Go on, Uncle Márton! It says... "Our ancestors came to this country as free men." "Thus is it fitting that everyone should be equally free today." "That... ...we be equal, beloved children, of this homeland." Of what? Our homeland! The homeland? What's that? Homeland? Homeland? What a peasant fool you are, that you don't even know that! You can hear it from the pulpit every Sunday! Especially lately. The homeland... Read it to him from the book... If it's in there. Everything is in here. "Do you love your parents? Would you stand up for them, if you had to defend them against any vile attack? Would you stand by them through life and death? The homeland is no other than a country-sized, big family. One that unifies us, one that helps the weak, one that grants justice to the destitute. We must transform our country to become this sort of homeland." Indeed... We certainly should. BUDA-PEST MARCH 14, 1848 CAFÉ PILVAX We demand universal equal taxation. Freedom of the press, and we demand the abolition of censorship. Evening mail from Vienna! Is Sándor writing the poem? I don't know where he is. He gave me this. Thank you. In France, they're dividing up the King's estates! Vienna's favourite general is under court proceedings. Berlin is seething. In Warsaw... In Prague... I regret that your Excellency had to personally come here from Vienna. People may recognize you. You can imagine how convenient it is for me that I am also forced to conduct the personal supervision of our men, like some chief of police. It could even be dangerous. Especially in these... tense days. Barricades everywhere around the world. The world is on fire! Yet, all we do dare to do against tyranny is... eat and drink to its doom. - You are right, but... - Let's continue. I'm a writer. We agreed that I would only serve you with the instruments of a writer. To only report on them in writing. I read it. Let me see these heroes with my own eyes. Who are the leaders? Here are gathered the elite of Hungarian Letters. My writer friends. Names, please. These are the twelve points the nation will request from the king. Request? It demands them! It will fight for the Hungarian nation! My friends, let's not be overhasty! I see. And the one in brown? Who is he? József Irinyi, a 26-year-old lawyer. Pál Vasváry, a 21-year-old university student. Mór Jókai. He is... Just a writer and nothing more. As to who is "just a writer", we will decide that. Right. That... lady in green is Mrs. Petőfi, Júlia Szendrey. And Petőfi? Petőfi? Petőfi is... perhaps the greatest poet in Europe. I don't see him here. Stormy days are coming. It is your duty to make every effort to calm them down. I don't have enough influence. Get some. Otherwise, the garrison will fire. Mention this to them. They'll open fire at the first infraction! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! I've just arrived by boat. Revolution broke out in Vienna yesterday! Metternich is out! I'm the representative of the Bratislava youth. All youth awaits your word to stand on its feet. On its feet! "Come, Magyar, the homeland calls!" "On your feet, Magyar, the homeland calls!" Sándor! Sándor, did you hear? You were right. The sea has risen! In Rákos tens of thousands gathered at the market today. For a real and new Parliament! Around it. This is the time for us to take the matters of our country into our own hands! From tomorrow this town is ours! This country! I seize this in the name of the people! NATIONAL SONG "On your feet, Magyar, the homeland calls!" "The time is here, now or never!" The time is here... By the God of the Hungarians we vow! We vow, that we won't be slaves any longer! The Magyar name will be great again. Worthy of its old, great honor. That which centuries smeared on it, we will wash away the shame! By the God of the Hungarians, we vow! We vow, that we won't be slaves any longer! Where our grave mounds lie, our grandchildren will kneel. - He's so pale. - Don't disturb him! And with a blessing prayer, Will recite our tainted names. By the God of the Hungarians, we vow! We vow, that we won't be slaves any longer! By the God of the Hungarians we vow! We vow, that we wont be slaves any longer! And that's not all, Your Excellency. There are 40,000 peasants standing at Rákosmező! This is terrible! This is a revolution! If we rouse them, they may turn on us! Colonel! Give the orders! We won't shoot. For the time being. Yes, Sir. We must reach an agreement. Today! It snowed earlier. You'll catch cold, my dear. No. It's clearing up. One of us is still missing! Let's liberate Táncsics from prison! ONE AFTER THE OTHER, THE PEOPLES OF EUROPE ROSE UP. BUT TYRANNY DID NOT GIVE UP THE BATTLE. AFTER DEFEATING THE ITALIAN REVOLUTION, VIENNA CONCENTRATED ALL ITS FORCES AGAINST THE HUNGARIANS. THE CROATIAN COUNT JELLASICH, THE EMPEROR'S HIRELING LAUNCHED AN ARMED ATTACK UPON HUNGARY. - We're fleeing! - Since morning. From the fields of Földvár. Those who went by yesterday told me of many horrors. Infants impaled on pitchforks. Little girls raped... And no one to defend them? I hope they don't get this far. Then we'll have to run as well! I'd rather be stabbed at my front door. But before that I'll use my pitchfork on them! - Or the scythes! - The axes! If only the sons of man had the weapons... to defend themselves. And what's theirs! That's right! All who have carts and horses have left. Paupers can't even leave! The gentry have it easy! What will happen to our children? I didn't understand everything from what he said... But what I did understand went straight to my heart. It convinced me. I'm going. - He spoke the truth. - Who? Lajos Kossuth's messenger. He just spoke at the market place. From a carriage. From a carriage, because he's travelling onwards. He's going everywhere to rouse the people! - For what? - For what?! Against the robber! Against the arsonist! Against that dog Jellasich! Kossuth's messenger said that beyond the Danube, Count Jellasich is attacking us with fire and iron! He kills anyone who is Hungarian! Hungarians? Why? Because they are Hungarians. Do you hear that people? Do you hear that? Are they coming here? Only if we let them! Enough of this shame! The messenger will come back tomorrow. Let all able-bodied men... go along with him. Along with me. All the way to Lajos Kossuth! My home won't be burned down by bandits! I won't let anyone spit me in the eye just because I'm a Hungarian! Why do they hate Hungarians? Because the Hungarians have only one God now. Freedom! We are going! On horseback, as hussars! What horse? With Lord Szárazberky's fine horses? He can also take part with a horse or two! We raised them! We'll go on raising them! We'll make them into warhorses! Don't you dare! We're just borrowing them! We'll return them! We don't want to... We don't want to die out there either. Bring them back! Dead or alive! The Hajduk men are after us! Good appetite, respected lord! Don't worry! I beg to report, my Lord, that all the restless young farmhands, after today's Assembly... have run away. To join the soldiers. They ran away? Taking with them, shamefully, the horses that they tended and raised. The finest of them all. My horses!? To join the soldiers. Am I to supply the horses for these supposed hussars? Once I learned, by the grace of God, what had happened, I sent the Hajduk men after them. Take the path! I'll go through the reeds! Are you leaving already? We hardly had a chance to see you. They need soldiers now. That's what they said at the meeting. What meeting? The one at the Szárazberky's farm. They said... we are all needed! What else can we give you, my boy? We have only some cornflour... If there's any left. But that's nothing. And this salt... It's been five years since the last time we had meat. I don't need anything from you. Only the scythe... Straightened out. You're too late, son. Your brother János has taken it. Where to? To where you wanted to take it. Then the pitchfork! Your brother István took the pitchfork. And Béni took the flail. Döme took the hatchet. They left nothing for me? You might take these... The fall will be cold. Gunfire will keep me warm! The other one! Daughter! Play some more. Play! Madness... Jellasich... It's all just simple border warfare. And you lost your mind! The peasants are holding meetings! And you want to leave the farm? Instead of getting into trouble with the elites of Pest, you should have studied your law books at the Pozsony University! March 15 was my university! You studied fine things, I must say. Their wages and a pasture aren't enough for them! Now they even take my horses! For free! For free! He's giving away for free everything that should be defended! What must be defended, above all, is the homeland! Not with words, but deeds! What did you say? We can talk about this peacefully at the table. Your son! Makes my blood boil! Yes. The skin would burn off my face with shame if I stayed home. When even ragged peasants join the army! Whom are you to obey? You! You! My sword! And my homeland! JULY 11, 1848. THE PEOPLE OF PEST EXPECT THAT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WILL AVERT THE DANGER. Down with Austria! Down with Jellasich! Hang the traitors! Down with Jellasich! Hang the traitors! Down with Jellasich! Down with Austria! I was in the southern regions. I saw with my own eyes that Jellasich has crossed the River Drava! He's heading for Pest! He's burning the land and looting! If we don't risk everything now... If we don't cut him off now, and stop this for good... His Majesty Emperor Ferdinand the Fifth, our gloriously reigning Apostolic King has not declared war. Therefore, there is no question of war, not even in constitutional law. We can thus entrust his Majesty with halting the Croatian uprising. Blindness! Stupidity! His Majesty has again sent Jellasich a stern message. Thus, it is proven that he is defending our constitution and status against him! The emperor? We don't trust him. The Emperor of China is closer to us! We need an army to defend the nation! A peasant army! That's right! You're a fool, Táncsics! Lord Szárazberky is right. We have no army. Kossuth will raise one! A peasant army! That's right! Kossuth, Kossuth... All you talk about is Kossuth! Always Kossuth? Yes, Kossuth! Who created our money? Kossuth! Who created our industry? Who stopped profiteering? Kossuth! Who builds ships? Who made contacts abroad? Who sent diplomats? Kossuth! Kossuth! Kossuth! That's why we always speak of Kossuth! Long live Father Kossuth! We won't bargain! We must protect freedom! The people are with us! - Where's Kossuth? - Is he still ill? Kossuth isn't coming? He must come! And he must decide. Kossuth! Now we'll see whether there will be a Hungarian homeland. Now we'll see if we can create a new one. Gentlemen... Our homeland is in danger. With today's decree, God has placed the nation's life... and the nation's death into our hands. You shall decide! I can say... that since March, I haven't had a single moment in which I could have been satisfied with myself. We were misguided enough to believe that the lords of the Viennese camarilla would be grateful to our nation. We didn't even recall our armies from abroad. Although Croatia is openly waging war. But why? When in March we fought for rights, we also fought for their rights. And these duped, unfortunate people have thanked us with this rebellion. But why? Because the power that lies within the walls of Vienna can no longer rule over Hungary! In these last moments, the truth was become clear! The Vienna camarilla is behind the Croatian rebellion! This compels me to state to the honorable parliament... that the nation is in danger. Or, it will be in danger. Unless the nation makes up its mind ...to live! Indeed, no nation, and no man, can live unless they are upheld by their own vitality, and not by the patronage of another. Gentlemen, I entreat you to make a great resolution. I ask the House of Representatives... To grant me 200,000 solders! Also the money needed for... Granted! Granted! Granted! Granted! That was my request. And you rose as a single man. For that... I bow my head before the greatness of the nation. And I ask you... To put as much fortitude in the execution... as much patriotism you put in the resolution. And Hungary will stand firm even against the gates of hell! Hurray! Hurray! OCTOBER 1848 THE HUNGARIAN INSURGENT ARMY BRAVELY STOOD ITS GROUND AT PÁKOZD AND OZORA. IT PURSUED JELLASICH'S ARMY TO THE AUSTRIAN BORDER NEWS THAT THE HUNGARIAN REVOLUTIONARY ARMY WAS APPROACHING INSPIRED THE PEOPLE OF VIENNA TO RISE UP ONCE MORE AGAINST TYRANNY. VIENNA The emperor has fled. They've left us behind. Prey to a crazed Vienna. To die a miserable death like rats. This is the gratitude of the emperor. For my loyal service. My dear Baron. Were I Vice-Chancellor of Transylvania, in this historic moment, I would at least give an appearance of remaining calm. The rabble of Vienna dare not break into the burg. Please leave. Once the people go mad... The people? What is "the people"? Hysterical women and snivelling children. You misjudge the situation, Prime Minister. If the Hungarian Revolution unites with Vienna's, it would mean the end of this world order. Live ammunition! If the people approach, fire! Don't fire on your brothers! TO: PRIME MINISTER KOLOWRAT HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL! You don't know the latest report from the battlefield. Jellasich is counter-attacking against the rebellious Hungarians. The situation isn't that dire, Baron. Have a little drink. It will calm you down. Baron Jellasich Joseph is here! Ban of Croatia and plenipotentiary military commissioner of Hungary. What happened? How soon can Windischgraetz's reinforcements get here from Prague? Two or three weeks. That'll be too late. The Hungarians have reached the border. I say, Sándor? You're in Pest? You article made us believe.... We thought you're fighting in Transylvania leading the Szeklers. - I couldn't even get there. - Sándor! What happened? I had to take my wife to Debrecen from Erdőd. Imperial officers are paying off people and inciting them against us in Aszód. There too? - Welcome! - Pálfy! A newspaper. Imperial officers, eh? I can't believe that. Fortunately on my way I heard good news: our troops crossed the Austrian border. Where are we now? The Home Guard has been stopped. They were ordered back to the Hungarian border. PARLIAMENT ORDERS HUNGARIAN TROOPS BACK TO THE RIVER LEITHA Impossible! And Kossuth? What did he say? He'll speak again today. To march into Vienna. And the General Staff? Issues contradictory orders to the troops. They are uncertain. Stopping is half defeat. We must continue the attack! We have to make the General Staff understand! You have no right to interfere in the decisions of the General Staff! We must respect the borders. Though of course the Habsburgs will not respect them! I forbid anyone to speak about his Majesty in such a manner! Especially one who agreed under oath to the Pragmatic Sanction, and who regards this sacred agreement... It matters as little as this scrap of paper! This is the creed of those, who have nothing to lose. Hot-headed, penniless people. God has blessed you with blindness! There's revolution in Vienna! And our path to them is blocked! Rumors say that Móga won't go to Vienna because the people are in power there! That's like him. But we shall do better. And we shall keep an eye on these hot-headed apostles. Immediately send word to the camp, to our friends. We must put this in the paper. Strike the iron while it's hot! - While I'm going... -...back to Debrecen? To the River Leitha! Near Vienna. And those hills? Those are already in Vienna. And the city? A four-hour march. Within our reach! And the soldiers? What do they say about the halt? A Viennese penknife. That's what they called it on the market. I'll use this to get myself a sword in Vienna. It knows what to do. That it does. Done. Next! It will serve well in battle! Look, it's Petőfi! You wait and see! He's up to something, I'm sure. I'd face the devils of hell with him to lead me! Petőfi? I know him. You know him? Where on earth from? I know him well. Even his mother. And his father. From Szabadszállás. Where I come from. I've looked over the whole camp. It's like the army that first founded our Homeland! These men weren't recruited by force. No one told them to fight. They don't fight for pay. Not for rewards. They sense... They feel... what is at stake. And if we help them understand... They will work wonders. We must stand by them. Exactly. Next to them, not above them. You're right. That's how it will be. You hear them, Sándor? They're singing. Captain! Are we going to attack? That's none of your business. Wait for your orders! This isn't what they promised back home. The problem is that even here the gentry are for the gentry, and nothing but sorrow for the poor man. Even here, it's just "silence, Jani", "keep quiet, Dani", nothing more. We should do something... that would shake up the Commander-in-Chief. Let's send a signal to the people of Vienna. Let's light bonfires. Ten... Twenty... A hundred! Look at the huge fire! Fire! Why did you light this huge fire? For the people of Vienna! Sándor! Uncle Sándor! Gyurka Hajdú... How you've grown since I last saw you! Major Sándor Nagy and his friends must finally understand. A rushed attack would be a catastrophe. In a war like this, where nothing is by the rules... As Colonel Artúr Görgey is beginning to see as well. I would like to remind you, Commander-in-Chief, that the government promised we'd help the people of Vienna! Against the emperor! To whom we swore allegiance - an oath which is still valid today! Its violation is punishable by lead and gunpowder! And confiscation of property! And eternal shame! You want to betray the people who have taken up arms and who have placed their trust in us! Just imagine what a mess we'd get into, if these troops of rebelling peasants joined up with the like-minded rabble of the Vienna streets! Triumphant and undisciplined! Sándor, I always looked up to you... like I'd look up to a star in the sky! How often we talked of you in the plains. I've never seen anyone jump as well as you back then, Sándor! Did you hear anything else about me, out there on the plains? No, praise God. Nothing bad. Only from these people here. They don't like us. They didn't even give us proper weapons. They say we are just rebels. They also say, why give us weapons, when we don't know how to use them. If only we had a way to fight back. Who can we trust? If we can't even trust our own leader? Do we even have a leader? But who will tell that? To those men? I saw it with my own eyes. That poet is inciting the soldiers again! I'll have him arrested. Petőfi? I wasn't commissioned to read poetry. I don't care who he is! Petőfi is very popular. My dear Görgey... A republican? A writer, general! And writers understand words. We must talk to him. He may be useful! What you say is surprising. One week ago today, I too smelled treason here... But... it's not treason... only reasonable caution. If we'd immediately pursued Jellasich, without any "reasonable caution", we'd have been in Vienna long ago and united with its people. I must confess that I fail to understand the connection between our battle for self-defense and the Vienna uprising. And the common enemy? Should I teach you strategy? Even now. If this camp is aroused, their enthusiasm will inspire even you. You still trust the people. Only few weeks ago, in your own native land, your life was in danger because of your nationalist ideals. Never mind. Even... if the people don't... I do know your worth... The battleground is no place for a poet. But seeing as you're looking for adventure here... Would you like to join the General Staff? If only for the sake of comfort. You could speak to the soldiers. Much more effectively, as you'd have much more authority. You don't even have to think about what to say. Your messages would be inspired by excellent minds. It's happened before that... they wanted to buy my pen... and my soul... But then, I had no sword at my side. But then... But they were enemies! They only wanted to discourage you. At the very least, I would like to warn you. Military rules apply to you too. Your irresponsible inciting actions can result in very serious sanctions. I was mistaken to believe that the Hungarian army has a leader. I wouldn't trust this leadership with my dog, let alone my country. Captain! So long as you are serving in this army... I only serve in it so long as it serves the revolution! Our land is a sorry battlefield. Where death reaps the harvest. Burnt villages, flaming towns. The wind carries moans of hundreds of thousands. Death and looting... all because of the king. Hang them! The kings! In vain, heroic blood you shed If a crown remains on the ruler's head. The monster then again will rise. Then you will have to slay it twice. So many sacrifices would be in vain. Hang every one of the kings! Messenger from the Chairman of the National Defense Commission. Send him in! What's this? Kossuth, Chairman of National Defense sends instructions to Commander Móga. Your troops must cross the border and attack the enemy immediately. If you wait for the enemy, you shall be defeated. If you move first and attack, you shall win! It is my conviction... that... Call Görgey here. From now on, you will obey him. I am resigning as Commander-in-Chief. Good. Let him decide. Let fate cast the dice again... If it wins, we win. And if it loses? If Windisch-Graetz's troops arrive? We can still win. Bring my horse! The emperor sends his regards. In the last minute! The Hungarians will be killed like sheep in a slaughterhouse. Do you hear that? Eighteen-pounder guns! This isn't Jellasich! Windisch-Graetz's cannons. We waited, now they're here! Now we pay for it! The situation is worse than we thought. Your Excellency's invincible artillery will do its work. The Komárom units are retreating! Help them! Down with the Germans! Move forward! Don't retreat! Don't retreat! Would you run now? When you should stand firm like a rock?! Get out of my way! Don't retreat! Attack! We have been betrayed! May God punish him who has brought this on us! Our blindness brought this on us! Let's fight! After me! It's too late! Doomsday has come! If we live, it's thanks to their swift feet. Yet they are worthy men, true soldiers. All the better reason to send them home. A popular uprising like this can easily lead to other kinds of uprisings. To Bratislava! Let's go! Sándor! Uncle Sándor! Have we lost the war? Have we been beaten? We are doomed. Gyurka... Look at those trees. Are they doomed? They will bud again in spring. Our spring will come too. We also can't be killed. Gyurka... Lajos Kossuth sent a message His regiment has run out of soldiers If he sends a message once more Then all of us must go to him. Long live Hungarian freedom! Long live the homeland! AT KOSSUTH'S QUARTERS IN BRATISLAVA Hurry, hurry, doctor! Commissioner Kossuth is unwell. They say that the old man found a leader for the Hungarian army abroad. Yes. None of us are good enough to be leaders? They've already found one. They're bringing him from Vienna. He's Polish. Bem. His name is Bem. It's not him. But they're waiting for him impatiently. Maybe that's why you've been called here today. He may not even come. Maybe Windisch-Graetz already ordered him hanged. Even if he does come... What does he know about things here? Even we can barely follow it. Goodbye. I'm Szontágh Pál. Bem? I've brought an urgent report to Kossuth. Finally! Come. As a matter of fact, who is this Bem? The book writer? Yes, him. A great soldier! An artilleryman! Until the last moment, he was the leader on the Vienna Barricades. And that makes him suitable for Hungarian general command? The Chairman of the National Defense Commission begs the pardon of General Görgey Artúr, who is next in line. An unexpected visitor. Lajos Kossuth will now see General Joseph Bem! I'm very grateful for your help. That coincidence has brought you from Vienna to Hungary. Vienna was the coincidence. The Lemberg Committee sent me to Hungary as I am partly of Hungarian origin. General. Allow me to describe the desperate situation of the Hungarian revolution. We could still stand up to the enemy face to face, if only we didn't have to fear an attack of our rear guard. From where? Transylvania is the crucial point. The military governor of Transylvania... Puchner... He has launched a war against us rousing the Saxons and the Romanians. The greatest weapon is in your hand. If all peoples get a share of the blessings of freedom. Those people must be granted what they desire. So, not only words. General. Do you consider yourself suitable... to lead the Hungarian army? Let me introduce myself with my deeds first. So, the country's most endangered spot is... Transylvania. Transylvania. Almost lost. Yet, strategically speaking Transylvania is the stronghold of Hungary. All of Hungary's freedom depends on gaining possession of Transylvania. Well? I accept to take command of the Hungarian Transylvanian troops. When can I go? Immediately. I shall supply you with references and an appropriate staff. Thank you. But I would like to travel without attracting any attention. I understand. Whoa! Whoa! Let us have the horses, we need them for our coach! I don't think the owner of the cart speaks our language. Mes excuses... Important state mission. We have to hurry. Thank you for your kind courtesy! We can't waste single minute! We have to be in Transylvania in two days. - What happened? - The new general is coming! - Who? - Bem, the great Polish general! Among other things, these gentlemen need to learn to keep quiet. MILITARY BARRACKS NAGYVÁRAD Where's the commander? Where's the commander? Where's the commander? Is this the commander's room? Yes. Where are you going? You're the commander? You will answer me. How dare you? Who are you? General Joseph Bem. Commander-in-Chief of the Hungarian Transylvanian troops. The revolution doesn't mean carelessness, chaos, disorganization... The revolution is about demanding accountability... from the disgusting parasites! The big ones as well... as the small ones. Those of yesterday and those of today. The regulation book! We don't have one. Get one by tomorrow. This is the first requirement for the campaign's success. The campaign? But... The campaign is on. Equipment? Clothing? Your task is to provide reserves. From what? From the funds the Hungarian government gave me. All the bookmakers, cobblers, tailors and hatters you can find in the town will serve in the army! Let all hammers make bayonets! Let all the pharmacists make gunpowder! The bakers, butchers, millers, gunsmiths, seamstresses must finish the work in a week! In a week? That's impossible, general! Don't you want to save your homeland? Erase the word "impossible" from your vocabulary! The only thing that's impossible is that justice fails to triumph! I want to visit the barracks. Guard your guns better in the future, son! What do you think of him? He was made for us. Guards to arms! Where is the Transylvanian army? At Csucsa... If there's any left... Sadly, we've lost Kolozsvár. We heard cannon fire. I'll make sure that you hear more of that. Isn't there a cannon-caster somewhere? - No, there isn't. - Áron Gábor at Vásárhely! I know him! You're coming with me. - Let's go! - To Csucsa? To the enemy, to the battlefield! Who are you? Bem's hussars! My first regulation into the book! Spare the poor! Regardless of their nationality! Whether Hungarian or not! No requisitioning! That's just another way of robbing the poor! How will we get oats? Don't put me in the position of having to shoot you in the head! And I even gave him cigar. But he's the devil himself! He just arrived. The more you know him, the more he seems like an angel. Who are you? Gergő Kicsi, Szekler hussar. And you? Kelemen Mikes. The one who used to be a count? Yes. But not anymore? No. That's a smart and healthy decision. Why is it healthy? It makes your head sit more securely on your shoulders. The only problem with cannons... is that we don't have enough of them. The military post is good. The enemy? Two or three hours' march away. And discipline? Not good. Especially among the peasant rebels. After many defeats, they don't trust anyone. We've decided to send them home. That is a serious mistake! Instead of sending them home, they should be reorganized! A fight for freedom can be won only with a people's army. A people's army that knows its purpose. One that knows both its goal and its duty. They always want to attack. To take back their homes. In this desperate situation when we have no guns, ammunition... Perfect. They're right. Signal to the troops. We'll attack! Soldiers! The government has appointed me as Commander of the Transylvanian army. I've brought guns and ammunition! The enemy is slaughtering your families! If you want to save them, you have to defeat the Austrians here! Together! I demand unconditional obedience! But whoever comes with me I will regard as my own son. END OF PART I PART II DECEMBER 1848 AS THE COUNTRY FALLS UPON HARD TIMES, PETŐFI IS INCREASINGLY ISOLATED, ALONE WITH HIS CONVICTIONS. HE IS SENT TO DEBRECEN TO SERVE AS A MERE TRAINING OFFICER. TO THE PUBLIC! GENERAL GÖRGEY CHOSE NOT TO RISK WAR NEAR GYŐR. THE WAR COMMISSION HOPES TO SOON REPORT OF A DECISIVE BATTLE THE LATER IT IS FOUGHT THE MORE VICTORIOUS IT SHALL BE. Don't jostle around so much! Everything's fine, see? Clear out of here! Sándor! You'll see the people loyal to the emperor in a different perspective. They know more about war than artists like you. We shall see. I can't say that I'm fond of Görgey. But I saw him at a county reception, in Győr. Of course. When he came in, the men were envious, while the women went wild for him. He was like a god of war. I don't like gods. They are unreliable. But I do love the people. REPORT: WITH THE NEW TRANSYLVANIAN ARMY, WE ARE ATTACKING TOWARDS KOLOZSVÁR. - Who the hell is Bem? - Bem! I saw him at Várad! Well, God sure wasn't in a good mood when He created that man! He doesn't look like a general. Rather like an old beadle. I don't care if he looks comical, if he has a solid heart and mind. I don't trust strangers like him, who knows where he came from. We've never even heard him. Come along with me to my newcomers. In half an hour I'll repeat Bem's words. - How? - Like this. "Soldiers..." "An army like ours... Can achieve wonders. Because it gives us the freedom to be patriots, to be enthusiastic, and to reflect." Now comes the best. "Enthusiasm makes men into soldiers and soldiers into heroes. Sometimes, the Marseillaise song can replace many cannons." Do you understand it? The Marseillaise song replaces many cannons? The Marseillaise, now for soldiers too? Yes. Starting riots on the streets wasn't enough? Similar words come out of your mouth all the time. These are Bem's words. It doesn't matter whose words! Captain! But today, you must address the recruits in accordance with these instructions! Sándor! Think this through! You must obey orders. Be careful! Don't mess with these people. I want to be at peace with myself. Not with the world. "Europe is quiet, quiet again Revolution no longer storms..." If our light did not shine... Throughout the endless night... What light, Sándor? On whom does this light shine? Nobody reads your poems. Those who do... don't understand a thing. And if they did... that would be disastrous for us. Chains... rattle on every hand. Only the Hungarian holds a sword. Sándor. Aren't you speaking to me? Go on... Go on, I hear what you're saying. Forgive me... Those poems... Poems... Sándor... My dear... We can't even afford swaddling clothes for the baby. What will we live on? With our child... Gaze down upon us... Gaze down upon us, Freedom! Come, and know your people. While others... do not even dare to shed a tear. We... will sacrifice our life's blood for you. We? Sacrifice for you... JANUARY 1949 GÖRGEY SURRENDERS THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL WITHOUT GIVING BATTLE KOSSUTH, THE GOVERNMENT AND THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY FLEE TO DEBRECEN. Debrecen's merit is that we are free from the noisy rabble of Pest. I hope these foolish folk won't get drunk on Kossuth's speeches! You couldn't talk Kossuth out of this madness even though you are always with him. There are others around him too. Jacobins. Jacobins? Now them as well? Yes, there are. Madarász, Irinyi... ...Petőfi. Then make sure to keep a closer eye on him! At any cost! Rose-tree in my mother's garden. I was the loveliest blossom. Until you cruelly picked me. And under your heel crushed me. Since our situation has become so critical, the National Defense Commission cannot ensure the physical and financial security of the ambassadors, nor the future of the nation. For this reason, I suggest that Parliament should once again send a committee to Windisch-Graetz. - Infamy! - Treason! The committee shall start unconditional negotiations as soon as possible. Enough! Lads! You don't know the words to the song! We certainly do, Captain. Yet still, you don't. That's not how the real words go. It's like this! Just listen. He who is a true Hungarian, a true hero, boldly meets his foe! Forward! Every Hungarian is a hero, of one mind with God! Forward! Every Hungarian is a hero, of one mind with God! You think that... just shouting freedom is enough? And if the moment of danger comes, we can simply step back? History will remember the names of traitors. The curse of the nation will haunt us if we are unable to defend Hungary! Here too, I suggest that we... we, who are Hungarians and also representatives... join, shoulder to shoulder, in the battle for our Homeland! Whosoever leaves his comrade behind... shall be shot in the head by whomever comes next! Is it the end, take my head, let us perish, not the land. Forward!" Is it the end, take my head, let us perish, not the land. Forward! Private! Make them stop that caterwauling down there! Caterwauling?! Lieutenant! Victory! Victory! Victory! Do you hear? Victory! Victory! General Bem reports! By Christmas Day, he drove out the Austrian troops from Kolozsvár, Naszód and Beszterce. Hurray! General Bem also reports the following: "I don't need any soldiers or weapons from the government. I shall get them all myself!" In ten days, he turned the tide in Transylvania. And the fate of all Hungary! Tell this to General Bem: I thank him, in the name of the entire Hungarian nation, for having kept his promise. Tell him: We shall fight on without any compromise... until we reach the final victory. Every Hungarian is a hero, of one mind with God! Forward! Under my feet blood flows on the ground. Look, Uncle Sándor! It's Father Kossuth! There is nothing worse than that, I'll serve you with my death. Forward! Hurray! God bless you son! God bless you! You're finally here with us! Piroska was so worried about you! We have to worry when we have such a warrior. Only your eyes can harm me. My son! He speaks the truth! I hope you gave your gout to Windisch-Graetz before coming here! I'd give him another thing or two, my dear son! He's destroying our property! What's left of it! Calm down! You do have a day or two off, don't you? I'm leaving tomorrow. Tomorrow? - I have another task. - What? I came to fetch someone. To Bem? Bem's request. Do you know Father, if Sándor Petőfi is here in Debrecen? Petőfi? Petőfi hasn't been seen anywhere. We don't need fine words, we need commands! I haven't seen his name in the newspaper either. We need lead for bullets now, not for printing! - But he's here? - He is. Rumors say the Minister of War made him a training officer. For new recruits. He can incite his peasants to his heart's content from right to left. The days of his great fame are gone. Where is he? All that Bem does in his spare time is read Petőfi's writings. Bem is looking for the noble nation in the wrong place if he chooses Petőfi! I raise my glass to Sándor Petőfi! Not just in my own name, but on behalf of the entire Transylvanian army, I say: Long live Sándor Petőfi, whose prophecies have come true! Let's hope that God fulfills his greatest prediction, the full triumph of Hungarian freedom, as soon as possible! Hurray! Amid all this rejoicing, I would add only one thing. Long live the Republic! Hurray! I am glad that I could bring Bem's greetings to you. And everyone else's who wants the freedom you've envisioned for years. He's waiting for you! Thank you! I will go to him! Without delay! - You'll have to ask permission first. - I'll write to Kossuth himself! Are you going away? Alone? To the battlefield. To Bem's camp. Without me? I've already done a few things without you, Gyurka. Poems... That's quite a profession too... I see that words seek to come from you. Why then do you stand in silence? All I do is just stand around. I never wanted to guard doors. But to be a hussar! And fight the enemy on horseback! Very well. If you want to come along, nothing shall prevent you, Gyurka. When we are leaving? As soon as Kossuth answers this letter. So hurry to deliver it! I'll will also request permission for the travel! Well, Juliska... No one can say that Petőfi is hiding behind his wife's skirt. And we... May we follow you? Together with my son! Aunt Mari! What can one to do to calm him down? Rock his cradle, my dear, sing to him. I can't sing. I love you my dear! I love you! I love your fragile body, your black hair, your snow white forehead, your dark eyes, your rosy cheeks, those sweet lips of yours, those soft little hands... Just to touch them is a cloudless joy! I love you, my dearest! I love you! No one has ever loved as deeply as I love you! I could almost die from it. I alone am your everything, all who ever loved you, who lives for you! Your husband, son, father, lover... brother... Sándor! I haven't seen you in a long time! No one hears about you these days. - Congratulations! - Thank you! Since I've become Kossuth's secretary... Speaking of secretary work... I have something important to tell you. Kossuth hasn't been able to read your letter yet. I see... But... But because of his important business... He can't receive you. You've solved it. Thank you. Don't misunderstand me... It's not out of the question. We sent your letter to Lázár Mészáros war minister. He will gladly be at your disposal. A letter to me from Kossuth? I don't remember. So many papers and reports lying around here... Like this! About Bem. An unpleasant business. I'd like to have that letter back. He's deciding property lawsuits. Giving the peasants pastures and forests. All this will lead to anarchy! To revolution! Some say that only a people's revolution can save the homeland. I request you again, to sent me to the battlefield. To General Bem. I would never do that. You are staying here. And see to it that as of tomorrow, you wear a reglementary uniform, I ask you with respect for the last time, minister of war... Instead of a costume parade, send me to face the enemy! To Bem's camp! Because it looks as if today, it is only in Bem's camp that one can live without dishonor. You either obey orders, or leave the military! I resign my rank as officer... I'll serve as a private. With or without your permission! Death won't care if I'm wearing a proper uniform or not. And here it is! "My friends and I... are convinced that Hungary only has a future, if it acquires the rights of which it is still deprived today. The people must immediately be given what they deserve. That is, land for the landless..." AMONG THE MOUNTAINS OF TRANSYLVANIA THE ENEMY, NOW REORGANIZED, USES EVERY MEANS TO DEAL THE INDEPENDENT HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT A FATAL BLOW. WITH HIS SMALL ARMY, BEM BREAKS INTO THE RANKS OF THE ENEMY. Every messenger brings bad news. Nagyenyer in ruins. They impaled its people on their swords. They killed every Hungarian. Traditional Habsburg methods. Divide and conquer. They deceive the Romanian people. But... Why do you spare these murderers? To give them time to sharpen their axes for our necks? The officers are revolting. We have to negotiate with the representatives of the Romanians. We need men who understand the people. Like that Petőfi... No news about him? Do you see? Transylvania.... General, you have to intervene before it's too late. I said from the beginning, the Romanian priests won't come to an agreement. This is where Avram Iancu's troops are stationed. Avram Iancu? He's some revolutionary. That makes him the right man to negotiate. Send delegates to Avram Iancu this very day! What about the priests? The two issues are connected. As we know, you want to shackle us. This is mafia. When did we make a difference in granting freedom? It's time to stop the massacre of the defenseless! And the arson! Continue, gentlemen! General, as messengers of God, we always God gave his due, and the emperor his due... Don't give the emperor anything! Let's follow the word of God together, as one people. Sándor Petőfi requests permission for conscription from General Bem. Not here. At the General Staff. Don't you understand, brother? He's Sándor Petőfi! The poet! Let's go, Sándor! Can't be done. Sándor! - Sándor, my friend! - I want to talk to Bem. Well, the old man's in a stormy mood. But I'll see what I can do. I have summoned you here to find a path to an agreement. Sadly, we don't have authorization to enter into an agreement. But we'll make a report! From whom do you expect authorization? From Saguna, the patriarch of Transylvania. We know him. But you don't know Avram Iancu, the people's true leader. Father Kristian... You lean too easily towards new ideas! These won't help us to agree. The new ideas are the agreement! Agreement? With these?! We must find a common language! So long as two nations hate each other this much... ...both remain in chains. They shackle each other. General, Sándor Petőfi is here. Show the honourable gentleman the way out. The poet? Bring him in. Their forces are superior. And our troops are so few? The military situation is difficult, but not serious. But what is truly serious is the situation as a whole. Your profession is words. Make your compatriots understand that the freedom of their homeland is only possible if they take upon themselves the cause of all oppressed people and every oppressed nation as their own. Especially for small nations, there's only one way to freedom. World freedom! And freedom between peoples. They think I'm a maniac for saying this so often. We can only win if we're with the people! I'm called a maniac for the same reason. I know. That's why I'm glad you came. You can be extremely helpful to me. My sword is at your service! You offer your sword, but I also need your pen! Your heart! I hereby name you my aide-de-camp! Do you accept? Then you must obey from now on. I entrust you with something more valuable than any weapon. The souls of my soldiers. Do you have a family? I have a wife... and a son. He looks like you. General... The people call you Father... Let me also be your son. My son... You don't even know... How much I missed you... What's your name? Gyurka Hajdú. Whom are you guarding? The one... Whose life is worth more than anybody else's. Ehh? That can't be true. Why not? That is the one I guard! The leader of the Hungarian army hereby orders and declares that every peasant, whether Hungarian or Romanian... consider the land they cultivate to be their own. This also applies to the house they built. The animals they raised. This is also part of freedom! If the gentry objects... let them face our cannons! They told us that if you come here, you will rob us of our freedom! Because we are just Romanian peasants. They said the same thing to the Hungarian peasants! Freedom is like air... It is for all nations or for none! We were watching you from the window, my dears. As you protected us, poor people... We brought you some food! - Thank you! - God bless you! - Goodbye. - God be with you! This is how things go around here? It's like that everywhere we go. To your health! Fine wine. To your health! Tastes good? It's very good. General, the men have packed. We are ready. Repeat the message, Gergely. I'll tell Major Gábor Áron to send the twelve cannons promised, without delay, because we need them urgently. Tell him also that our cannons have been destroyed. Victory also depends on his cannons! Your path through the enemy is dangerous. Look after each other. We will. Gyurka! Make me proud! Thank you for your kindness, uncle Sándor! NAGYSZEBEN: HEADQUARTERS OF AUSTRIAN GENERAL PUCHNER The Emperor recognizes the great deeds of Your Holiness so far, but now he expects more. More? That is, from now on, the Emperor considers every means acceptable in order to restrain the proud Hungarian race. Your word is like the Scriptures. The new Church bows down before it... insofar as we also receive written assurance. You still don't understand. We must stop the actions of that adventurer Bem. That will be very difficult, Your Excellency. That crazy Kossuth is telling the truth! That the fate of Europe will be decided in this place. You won't be alone. The secret police will support you in your task. That is... to incite the Romanians and the Saxons and put the blame on the Hungarians. Burn their fields, granaries, barns everywhere! Let them starve! Curse them with ice and fire! You may go. I hope you have finally understood. You have a free hand, gentlemen. Then we shall begin the holy war, in the name of God. The Hungarians did it! Curse them! The Romanians did it! Curse them! Father, let's hide! Soldiers! - What kind? - From the Emperor! Oh my God! The emperor's soldiers! Again? Men like these should be burned. Eszter! Where are you? There she is! There! Murder, looting and violence are in their blood... Oh, Lord! Our God in heaven... Good evening! Gergely! My dear Gergő! Anikó! My little brother! These are Bem's soldiers! Yes, the old man's. Then we are brothers! He is the father of us all! Right, my girl? Come out! Our soldiers! Out with the hidden food! And bring your lovely faces too! Gergely... - Here you go! - Don't I deserve better? - No! - But we have the same rank. - What? - Almost... Thank you. We have an important mission. Can we proceed to Vásárhely? To Vásárhely? Where Gábor Áron is working. Those Germans surrounded the town because of him. There's no way. I know a way in. I always said, the song is right: "Girls should be hussars too!" I'll lead whoever comes with me. If the Germans do stop us, just say that we are bringing water for the wine. We'll trick them! We are Szeklers after all. As for you, Gyurka, you'd best not open your mouth. Well, well! Want to silence me already? I haven't even married you yet! It isn't too late if you're afraid! Well, Szekler... Want to take a chance? Yes. That's how it should be. Let's the wedding begin! Uncle! Send Major Gábor Áron to me immediately! The major? Sergeant isn't enough? Uncle Áron! Now, brother. We came from General Bem. Am I to believe you? The other messengers all perished. The devil take it... Going back will be harder. With cannons. I've made twelve, I'll send all of them to Bem. How did you slip past the enemy? The Austrians are everywhere. If we could come in, we'll get back out. Even with people like this. Come! Watch out for this last cart especially. - Who'll drive it? - I will, if you don't mind, sister. Someone has to be last! If I were a soldier, I'd always want to be first! Let's hurry, we don't have time! Szeklers! We are off! God bless you! Wait a little bit. - Let me see your eyes. - My eyes? So I can find you once I return. PUCHNER'S HUGE ARMIES SURROUNDED BEM'S TROOPS. As you can see, the Emperor has no cause to worry. We'll crush the revolution! The embers are still glowing in all of Europe. We must hurry! In Germany, in Galicia, even in the Tsarist army, they are forming committees. Revolutionary emigrants are joining the fight with the Hungarian rebels. Only to meet their doom! The comedy is over! Halt! Halt! Who goes there? Halt! Go! If I die, avenge me! Death is better than slavery! Fire! General, I requests an order to commence the attack! No! The artillery will be more than enough to turn them into dust! You live once, you die once! Damn them! They have at least 40 cannons! We only have these four! But they haven't even one Bem! You see that hill with that little tree on it, son? Yes. All Puchner's ammunition is stored back there. Too far... But if we moved the cannon up into the front line? Will you do it? - I will! - Let's wheel it forward! Cursed Pole! What a disgrace! He forces me to attack! What are we waiting for? Sound the alert! We must not let them reach the bridge! If they get here we are lost! We can't leave a single cannon behind! Save the cannons! I'll follow you after! Go! Hurry, go! Hurry up! The cannons! Look over there! They've arrived! Put the cannons behind the bridge. The enemy will pursue us. They will be trapped into the valley. They'll cross the bridge, and face Áron Gábor's cannons. This is the rat trap! Lieutenant Szárazberky. The cannons stay behind the bridge, ready to fire! A company is covering them! That will be all! Send every messenger to the battlefield! Sound the alert! - The cannon is in danger! - Attack! Blow the trumpet! Blow it! They're getting close to the cannon! Let's tow it away! Halt! Halt! Halt! Szeklers! Quickly! Assemble the cannons! General! We swore that death would be better than retreat! Then you shall break your vow! Death is easier than following orders! But General! Anyone who doesn't obey will be shot dead! At the bridge we attack again! Retreat! Retreat! Backwards! General offensive! That adventurer Pole is in my hands! Pursue him! The Vienna legion attack from the rear. Use the Romanian rebels too. We can't, unfortunately. Avram Iancu won't fight against Bem. Retreat! Stand ready! Range: 50 paces. Cartridge! The Germans are coming! Now fire! And reload quickly! Back! Back! We have to run! Forward, my sons! Attack! My fellow soldiers! After me! Polish legion, forward! Forward, my sons! Avenge our dead! Soldiers! You saved the homeland! Thank you, my sons! FOR THE PEOPLE AND FREEDOM UNTIL DEATH General Bem's victory in Transylvania, defended the mind and heart of this War of Independence! Saved the Hungarian revolution! Hurray! They won again. Against us too. - For good. - For good? Only according to Kossuth. They don't know what is coming. And now, let the decisive battle begin. In all Europe, it is only here that the fire of freedom still burns. I know. There will still be hard times ahead. But a fight for freedom... never loses hope! Real internationalism. Soldiers of world freedom! Write it down in heaven as eternal justice, Though the galley is above and below the water floods, Still the water rules! The water rules! THE END
