It changes everything If the body isn't found... you can only get the inheritance in 5 years Starting from the probable date of death Article 115 of the Law Pardon me, I don't quite follow If he's dead We have to wait 5 years? That's unbearable! Such is the law First time I hear about this When my father died... The colonel died in his bed He was there... where he last closed his eyes Your uncle, on the other hand... Sir, you say there's no doubt about his demise Medically speaking he's dead But legally he's absent I'm sorry but there's nothing i can do A dead man should be easy to find We've looked everywhere He couldn't go far In his state... Would you like to see the premises? I'm at your disposal Who brought this in? I did Optimist Have you seen Jeanne? Strange folk Very inconvenient - Debts? - Yes, debts For the last 2 months, Mr de Kellequen hasn't left this room During the last week... he couldn't even sleep he made terrible progress he stayed there in this chair il est toufaive But he still found the strength to put on his Knight of Malta attire Are you sure? Certainly, the dress is no longer in the closet He had lost his mind It's tradition to be buried in the Knight of Malta clothing Nobody stayed by his side? When he needed something he called Marthe You know very well there's a hidden room The one used by Mr Charette in july 1895, that infamous thursday You believe in this hidden room? I'm curator of the National Museum. I know about these things. - Let's tear down the place - Not before the 5-year's passed There's millions worth in this place Millions...hundreds of millions you mean The old man's got a spell on us Berieved us, you should say And don't forget... during these 5 years you'll have to maintain this castle Bear the costs Pay taxes Pay with what? We take some things 5 years - We'll borrow money - On what grounds? Nothing here belongs to you This is enough to make you mad Like so many others, we'll open the castle to visitors We'll hire a conservator Still remains to see if we have the right Nothing says we can't I say it's a scandal! What bad luck! Marthe... just who we need You know very well the ideas of the Count Strangers at the castle He couldn't hardly stand his own family being present If you had taken better care of him we wouldn't be here today The Count ordered me to leave him alone You don't have to worry about the old fool anymore I can assure you if I had been there... I'd have chained him in his room He wouldn't have left alive My god if he'd hear you talking From wherever he is... - What shall we do? - Let's get settled in the castle I promise we'll find what we need - Are you optimistic? - What can I say? I'm a notaire, not a clergy man You think you're so smart You make me drive 60 kilometers at this hour You disguise yourself in fancy dress we arrive and there's no dead Get back in Hello, can't I visit your castle? On one condition... You'll keep quiet I'll be a mute Like a carp It's me, the carp Say something In the 13th century An evil nobleman called Simon de Kellequen lived in a castle with his young wife Eliane He was our great, great, great... grandfather The Count had only one great passion: hunting Soon Eliane took a young lover a handsome knight While the count left the castle... Eliane attached a white scarf at the highest window Seeing this signal the knight came a-running The count left with his spearmen and his dogs Far away in the forest One could hear the sound of trumpets and the howling of the pack How could the lovers suspect anything? However... It was a cunning trick Leaving his hunters behind the count returned The count climbed the stairs to Eliane's room A terrible duel ensued between the two rivals The husband called the lover Desperately Eliane went hiding in the tower She loosened the scarfs that symbolised her lover holds them close to her heart and threw herself out the window So Micheline I'd like to climb the tower Behind this door lies the grand galery the treasure room The birds enter via the open windows they fly around and around and can't get out What's over there? Here's the attic... and its ghosts If your castle were mine I'd know what to do I'd organize a light and sound spectacular With the Legend of the Lovers we'd have a full house every night Micheline, my love you're a genius Stop it I can't take it anymore You don't know how much I love you You love me Yet you left me - Remember how it used to be - Be silent It's too late now I can see clearly in love with your nephew a dishonest guy unsavory, shady They probably said it's my fault So marry her quickly Before it's too late Like a composer... an artist... a failure It's so difficult Jeanne Jeanne I want to talk to you Andr?, please... Listen I haven't told you everything He's seems so sweet and harmless But he's jealous and sick He watches my every move Sometimes he locks me up He imprisons me I'm scared You're so nervous You have nothing to fear Listen to them He's far away I beg you take me with you In the 13th century Get down from there So Guillaume How's the test going? I can't find anything No mention of the underground even though I have here the work of my esteemed collegue Samacul Samacul Do go on And you... How's things? I'm at my second bottle Obviously The text is almost finished? Take it easy Inspiration isn't like electricity It's not as easy to come by Listen to this Centuries have gone by When there was nothing Wolves howled over the land quenching their thirst in the lake called Kellequen in the old language: Maroub?te One day... a knight passes by leads his horse to drink and finds the place divine He settles down and builds a castle That's just stupid! That's not the meaning of "Kellequen" Who cares? The tourists want medieval stuff Heraldry So, the crime has been abandoned They will find that interesting Nothing else The computer is ready But listen to this... There's a complaint because of the loudspeaker in the chappel He doesn't want be disturbed while playing Let him grumble while we continue our work There's also the 2 broken projectors I'll fix that tomorrow You'll have other things to do tomorrow I'll do it myself The power's off, right? Yes, completely Aaaaaaaarrrgggghhhhhh Julien, Marthe's husband found the body Who had put the power back on? Probably one of the workers without knowing the danger There's only 2 buttons on the machine Will he turn himself in? He would already have done that by now The cops spent two hours in the castle Besides, it wouldn't bring Henry back alive What do your relatives say? We don't talk that much Except when our interests are at stake Tomorrow they're gonna probe the walls The day after, they'll drain the lake Guillaume has sent for a dowser An amazing guy I'm told Do you think we're a strange family? Even you This pile of money just out of reach You must think I'm crazy Look at me It's true you're not the same What's wrong There's this amazing thing We're all looking at each other as if we're not on the same side We used to be friends This whole castle for us We don't know each other anymore Leave them be Let's take a trip Why? I told them about your idea for a sound and light spectacle What will they think if I run away? You don't want to embarrass the family, right? Then stay! But I'm not related to the deceased I'm out of here! I'm tired of your castle and your treasure That's Hedvige That's what I thought she's suspect Is she just riding or going on a date? What are you on about? She's widowed, she's young she's pretty A date? You don't know her I'd like to get to know her Tell me, Jean-Marie... Is it because of me you don't want to introduce us? Or is it because of your family you don't want me to meet them? You're unpresentable Ivan? I'll be right there What do you want from me? Take care of Princess she covered in sweat No surprise I'm not asking for your advice but for a service It's almost 11 pm It's an order It's dangerously hot in there How long have you been working here? 6 months How did the count act towards you? Like you Do you find it amusing riding this late? I love the night time Take off my boots They're glued to my skin Don't hit me that hard, Andr? you'll hurt me Don't speak, gentlemen Don't talk How can I record the sound? So cousin, still looking? If you can't find him Look for our uncle Maybe we'll strike oil Too bad he doesn't believe in anything Over there Your uncle fell in the canal Look at my pendulum What did I say it's infallibble No need to continue Your uncle isn't here It's pitch black below We'll have to drain the lake Leave the bedroom of count de Kellequen You're now entering the grand galery... First, at your right...First, at your right... First, at your right...First, at your right... Old fellow, i'd say your disc your disc, your disc... Thanks, I can hear it ...courage In god's name it's been fired 7642...9872 25000...32000 18000...4963 - 320000 - 320000? What's that about? - The electric material - That's not possible You must have added something Your tip I'm amazed you talk to me at that tone. A tip ?! - That word coming from your mouth - What are you insinuating? What I'm insinuating? What's everybody knows If you're gonna speculate here like you did in Africa... We'll see you in court A punch in the face How much would that cost me? Please be calm, where not gonna fight over a matter of percentage We'll pay what is due How much do we owe? Approx. 2600000 that's 350000 each Pfew! Pardon me... - It's actually over 400000 each - How so? We're only 6 now - Henry is dead - You already forgot about him It's only our spiritual cousin having fun We have to find some other form of distraction Have you found another? Tell us Yes tell us The more I'm drunk... The more I'm fed up Marthe Take that away You don't his wife is cheating This very moment she's with her lover And he? He plays his organ Oh! This is still on... No! Please don't! That's terrible what you're telling me Claude has killed Andr? Anger...Jalousy Hatred We're not thrown from the tower? A girl so tormented Don't get carried away No, I'm just thinking about the legend The husband returns Claude The death of the lover Andr? The suicide of the lady Jeanne Doesn't the co?ncidence strike you odd? There's no proof of Jeanne being the mistress of Andr? I know her I cannot believe it She was devastated when the cops came for her husband I hope this time you'll drop it I'm fairly sure old Marthe was right Listen Micheline think about it Everything is ready The inauguration is in 3 days You persist You don't quit I warned you I'm leaving you here I'm going back to Paris No, you're no longer sleeping This is not a bad dream A door has been opened A woman has been surprised ...and a man killed Don't search, Jeanne You cannot see me But I can see you I see you I see you Because of you Andr? is dead You are guilty Guilty! Hedvige! She's gone the cow still sleepy? sit down - What's wrong - Nothing There is something wrong I don't dare enter my room anymore Why? I hear voices And you listen And when I call You don't hear me I hear a voice A voice all around me Everybody hears voices here It's a loudspeaker The castle's full of them What does the voice tell you? It says I'm guilty It's tormenting me You're not guilty, Jeanne I've been told when you were little... You were often scared You were a sleepwalker But now you're a big girl Do be alone Let's have some tea I stop the record player and I cut the power - So Julien, you understand? - no Come closer, I'll start again Why? I don't like electricity I'm scared I don't want to die like mr Henry Someone has to take care of this when we've left It's child's play I switch the electricity on Obviously, nothing lights up Because there's no one in the castle But suppose a visitor enters the first room The first sensor will come on Then you put the record on and you put on the speaker of room 1 Now the visitor enters the second room Second sensor gets activated Switch off speaker 1 Put the needle on track 2 and switch on the appropriate speaker And so on That's not too hard is it? Would you like to try, Jeanne? Did you get it all? The light Who's walking around? We're all here So we must conclude... It's not a set up Look, he's entering the old man's room Keep calm, Jeanne A slight breeze could start a rocking chair A ghost would be a lot more cool Don't be silly Maybe the old man is still alive? You saw the doctor's report too And his rocking chair Don't start again Very clever...Is our life not ruined enough already? What's up? Have you taken the tins of beef? Tinned beef? There were 3 tins and a can of sardines A loaf of bread has also been stolen What? They've stolen stuff from the kitchen - When? - Last night Keep this to yourself Understood? Don't mention it People are nervous enough already Probably just a joke by Christian Man overboard! What's wrong? I'm fed up Even worse... I'm bored Is that why you're clowning about? What do you want me to do? I can't be a soldier like daddy I don't have his health I can't be a banker I don't have a penny I can't even be a vicar I have no faith So what can Daddy's boy do? I could be a squire There's no more castle It's you You frightened me No, seriously You could kiss me Explain yourself No, not here No, not the camembert Are you kidding me? Get going How weird Not at all I've thought of everything Come sit next to me What am I getting Beef... So the rocking chair... that was you You know about it? More or less Well done Let me explain Why did you walk around in the castle? what are you doing here? You'd rather have me go back to Paris What do you do all day? I think about things You reflect Exactly When you're asleep or when you're all outside I go browsing 2 people dead your uncle missing I want to know all What did you find out? Nothing much I have deducted some things What's the result of your deduction? I've concluded: 2 deaths means minus 2 heirs Meaning? That means if this goes on without any suspects The last one standing will inherit all What are you playing at? for Henry, you didn't know the power was back on No Nobody has wondered why Benoit left his organ to confront Hendry How did he know about his wife's date Go on and say it was one of us We haven't yet found the body of our uncle Such a risk for waiting 5 years What risk? First one was an accident Second one a crime of passion Forget all that Tomorrow is the opening the day after we're out of here You're always saying: we're out of here We'll leave in style Mister prefect No Julien, that won't do The prefect will come Certain? Even a man from the museum here are the confirmations I got invoices and mail How's Jeanne? Still the same, in her room Too bad, I've an convocation for her from the examining magistrate They want a confrontation with her husband Any news about Benoit? No, he refuses to make a statement. How strange I think it's dignified This summons hinders our plans You have to give it to her Give this letter to madam right away Yes sir Black suits you Who are you mourning? Your husband in prison or for your dead lover? How lonely is little old Jeanne Lonely and helpless At the back of the gallery there was a door This door led to the tower So Eliane, helpless and desperate Eliane wanted to die And you think Jeanne can go on living? Jeanne! Follow Eliane's route You are Eliane! Open this door Open this door! Climb those stairs Climb! Take that, 'cause you won't be at the feast Go on 'Evening, madam She doesn't recognize me all stuck up Silent! They don't scare me Drunkards! Whores! Prefect, we are honoured to welcome you at this dress rehearsal My pleasure, madam I present you mr Dhon of the Ministery of Arts and his wife You are the heart and soul of this undertaking Allow me to introduce my cousins In the 13th century... lived in this castle... count Simon de Kellequen and his young, beatiful wife Eliane The count had only one passion ...hunting Fair Eliane was often abandoned That day, as so often Simon de Kerlequen departed with his men He went with his huntsmen and his dogs chasing wild boar in the neighbouring woods The troop left the castle... Eliane climbs up the tower To the highest window she attached a long white scarf that's the signal Gilles, a young and handsome knight Eliane's lover is coming Gilles approaches Eliane's chamber How the lovers were worried! Didn't they hear the trumpets blare and the howling of the hounds But what was that galloping? It's Simon De Kerloquen who returns Suspicious, he had abandoned his men in the woods Dismounting Simon unsheathes his blade The count climbs the stairway He arrives in the hallway Only 3 doors to go Only 2 more Only 1 more The count batters the chamber door Eliane hurls herself before Gilles to protect him But Gilles throws her aside Gilles falls down deadly wounded Eliane runs away Up the tower Once again she's up the narrow stairs She's at the top She arrives at the window In the window She unties the white scarf She throws herself into the void Sound the bells again I'm going Marthe looks at us like we're assassins She doesn't forgive us for continuing the spectacle We have permission No difficulties The prefect shares our view Upon hearing the story of her ancestors Jeanne had convinced herself she was Eliane She played the part 'till the very end A case of "transferring" Medical case You should know about this Jean-Marie Yes exactly What's wrong? Why the long face? We should be punctual This place is anarchic Has she left a long time ago? As usual This mania, she has the entire day for riding, even at night She chooses when to have breakfast What is she up to? Not that I'm worried But with everything that's happened here In god's name! Look at that This is all worn out it was inevitable Where is she? In the woods or at the lake Come with me, hurry! Nothing broken at first glance - Listen to her breathing - What's the matter? She was knocked out Her pulse is rapid she's out of breath Let's get to the hospital 20km in her state? That's stupid What should we do? I'll take her back to the castle Fetch me some carbogen to stimulate her respiration Let's move quickly Easy... She's responding well If night passes without complications I'll be confident Marthe, is that you? Where are you going at this hour? - I'm leaving - Where to? Anywhere I can't stay in the castle any longer You're not staying for the spectacle? I'm told it's very pretty What I saw the first night was more than enough The count would never have approved It's sacriligious The count went up the stairs The assassin was you My dear cousin Did you believe the riding accident this whole charade? Don't go my dear Guillaume You're drunk Guillaume Stop the spectacle Light up the courtyard Stop the man who's coming out Do what I tell you Shoot! Pardon? Shoot! In the legs Go on shoot him he's the assassin The assassin? The assassin of whom? The old man
