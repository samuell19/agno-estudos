This story is about a small, very small planet in the universe called Earth On it lives a very small young girl her broad chest harbours a story "The Aimed School" Good morning... Morning Wait for me Good morning... See that? Not clearly Don't you feel excited? Yes Who is it? What are you doing? We were just crouching here Don't fool me, I saw everything You little kids, what are you doing? why are you so excited? - Right... - This is our panties heaven - You want to look too? - What are you saying? - What are you mad at? - Good morning - Yuka - Good morning... - These kids... - Let's go, goodbye - Stand still... - Goodbye These young devils - Kohji is also a kid - Hurry What are you saying? Don't get mad But I understand why are you so mad You knew it It's the start of a new term The button is lost What a miracle, you got promoted Good morning... You haven't been very serious I gave you the key study points for examination but you still got low marks Hope this could cure the voyeurism What do you mean? Don't ask Good morning... From tomorrow onwards don't use the fly-over - Use the zebra crossing - Why? - Doesn't that mean a longer way? - Why? There's a pervert - How could that be? - That's true - Good morning... - Megumi, wait for me Don't use the fly-over again - It's really strange! - Yuka, good morning How are you? Good morning Let's go Hurry Good morning Good morning Good morning Hurry Good morning Gone... - So tired - Indeed Go... Hurry and get in I want to drink It'd be a waste to give it to you, let me drink it Good Do secondary school students know only about studying? What can examinations prove to you, tell me No, what I mean is our school is an experimental institution The discrepancies shouldn't be too great What? Didn't we say we should be healthy in body and mind? Isn't a healthy body necessary for exams? Do you mean what you said is nonsense? Please clarify for me I...I'll think about it I'm busy right now I've to handle some suspended student cases - Keep up your work - Yes - Teachers will do their best to help - Thanks - Buck up - Alright - Then I'm going back - Alright Mr. Yamagata Principal wants to cut all extra- curricular activities & focus on studying only I object Our school is an excellent school Please understand or else those who are only good in Physical Education would neglect studying and bad students would increase Our class is the same Good morning, Teacher - Stop playing - Sit Teacher is here Good morning Stand up Greetings Good morning Teacher... - Here you go again - Sit It's embarrassing A new school year now You are now students of the Second Year But before I start teaching I must tell you I've been teaching this class for a year yet I have a heavy heart The student with the highest marks is in this class but the 5 students with the lowest grades are also in this class This has made the results of this class the lowest of the year It's you Teacher What is it? Please announce the worst five - What - Who suggested this? This will hurt them I think it's better not to do this Then who's the one with the best results? Of course it's Yuka Mitamura That's correct...it must be her You are marvellous He's right None of your business, shut up Keep quiet... Being a matter of glory for our class I'm announcing it This first goes to Mitamura Shut up Teacher, I want to know why am I not the number one Your English and Mathematics are really better than Mitamura but your grades in Physical Education are really bad That's good. I never care about Physical Education anyway - This has nothing to do with examinations - But... Right. That's why I feel no regret Unlike those who are only good in Physical Education but poor in other subjects Are you refering to us? I didn't mean that - What are you talking about? - You are so arrogant You are such a book-worm You are good for nothing else Keep quiet, this is a classroom Sorry...Mouth is zipped Teacher, I suppose all have reflected on themselves They'll be working even harder this year Really? Then all you guys have to work very hard Teacher, we're females, what do you mean 'guys'? Then I take back what I've said, sorry Everyone in the class has to work hard Put in more efforts this term Lesson begins For the group, results mustn't be too bad Yes, membership has been declining recently We're going Good bye People genuinely interested in Kendo are getting less They talk their way through Take yourself for instance you could get good results even with little effort unlike people who study all day and yet get lousy results I envy you Our family car Has your dad been summoned by teacher? It's just the start of the term Your promotion may have some problem - Nuisance - Study hard afterwards, no big deal - Right - Do you want to look for your dad? Give me a break Friend, come on... Want to join the Kendo class? You'll grow tall like me in half a year Really? We never lie Wait, next month there's a Kendo competition You could make it, join now I need to discuss with my mom You are not in kindergarten You can decide for yourself If you don't join us, what club would you like to join? - Come on - Let's go - We have a manager - Which one? Our manager is beautiful. Look, here she comes Well? This fellow wants to shake hands with you Let's shake hands, you must join Alright Welcome Good bye... Good bye... Good bye... Only one guy joined Don't be so particular Just work harder Go back, hurry How could it be? What happened to you? I just... I just... How are you?

Michiko Good evening, how is Chosuke? - You're back - Yes Brother is back You're back Kohji So late - Practising Kendo? - Right Be careful today Your dad's blood pressure seems to go high Really You think I could take it? I want to train in Kendo Don't underestimate me, I am a good at it I was called to the school I was so embarassed Have you ever thought about my reputation? Never mind, results are no big deal Besides, after graduation I still have to take care of this shop How could this be? You must study at the university Listen, that is your late mother's dream Yes, mom would be sad Only good in physical training the others are like in swan troop What do you mean? Failure in all The figures are like swans - What a quaint comparison - That's not important Kohji, take up your duty as the eldest male child Put in more efforts please Your dad would give anything for you to study hard I feel so sorry I've only studied up to secondary, can't help young master I really feel bad - Sorry - No one wants your help Stop speaking nonsense Oh, have you delivered the beer to Mitamura? Not yet Madam, even a fool knows how to use scissors I am not that stupid Boss, I think it's better to get a private tutor Could anyone manage him? Yes, right before your eyes Girl from Mitamura's family No way Right...Shouldn't have too much scruples Let's get that girl to teach Kohji We know their family Great idea Give them a discount on the beer they ordered Let's strike the iron while it's hot, I'm going to talk to them now - I'm going - Okay... - Thanks for your help - Mom - Leave this for me - No problem Attack Stop fooling around How do you feel? Mom, do I look okay? Does my face look okay? A bit pale, but still okay Why do you ask? Today I... Well? What happened? Mom, is your intuition strong? Intuition? You mean sixth sense? I...

Mom, the beer is here Hi, I am delivering the beer - Thanks - It's okay I have a favour to ask it's important to our family Listen up I'll be serious Kohji, our young master - Coming - ...has been having bad results - Teacher? - So our master - What is it? - He wants... I don't understand what do they want? I was almost expelled from school Then there's also today's incident I suppose that's only a coincidence Guess the driver must have backed the car himself You care about it so much. I am truly worried Then you refuse to be the private tutor I'll think about it Good bye Arikawa This term I'm going to come through I have found a great tuition class; its location is a bit secretive albeit Welcome - Miss, thanks - How are you?

What's up? Thanks for your hospitality Sorry, I don't feel well, I'll go back first Let me take you No need Wait, don't go I'm going Yuka, let me take you Who are you? Come, get in I was taken in by a strange force Who is this man? Perfect day, huh? Didn't you let Kohji win? How do you know? Of course I do Because we are partners Partners? Yuka, you should realise that I've protected you all this time Haven't you been calling me? For this... I am very clear Am I right? If you work with me you can become a superwoman You can manipulate the whole world You've said so much but I don't understand a bit Let me think about it Who's he? It seems that I've known him since quite long Don't you like cake? Didn't you always like it? I don't want it now What happened? You don't look good Are you not feeling well? I'm fine, goodnight Honey Do you think she could be in love? Really? Looks like it Could it be Kohji? No, it's someone else She doesn't have any appetite and sighs from time to time She's been acting strange, don't you think? That's puberty I suppose Can't you understand that? Is it so? Still the same with us Living day to day without much awareness but something in my heart has changed Yuka You look tired recently What's with you? Even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me You haven't even tried Do you remember a young kid... The one almost knocked down by a car? Yes I do What's the matter? It was me How could it be? I fixed it so our school won the last time - What are you saying? - That's my ability What nonsense are you talking? - You really don't believe me - Of course Really? Yuka, what's the matter with you? I have a bad hunch I am perturbed But why? Good morning You're early today - For once I am not late - Hurry Good morning Great...I see it Special service Great You really dare... So painful What's this about... So painful - Good morning... - So painful Good morning - What are you doing? - Good morning - Are you afraid of exposing your panty? - Good morning Yuka Good morning Yuka Good morning Let me introduce our new student Takasawa She has switched from Sapporo, Hokkaido to our college Hi everyone, I am Takasawa So beautiful... We are so lonely... Look our way... Look our way... Look our way...we're the lonely ones You're so rude, watch your behaviour please - Right - Please welcome our new student with sincerity It's okay, this is a good and sincere class just a little bit uncouth Tomota, Takemura Wow, how did you know their names? Tamiya Iguchi and our no.1 student Yuka Mitamura Hi, we must be nice to each other Great... We'll get along just fine Teacher... It's about time to select a class representative - Takasawa - Pervert The new semester's syllabus has been set Then let's do the usual and have an election Can I say something? Because I am a candidate for election to the Student Union I cannot be the class monitor, I am so sorry You think too much No one knows you, who would elect you? That is to say... By the way, the candidates for the Class Monitor would be Arikawa and Mitamura and I'll definitely support Arikawa What are you talking about? Stop talking nonsense We know what to do We won't change so easily because of you, right? That's correct - Who do you think you are? - Step down - Nuisance - Talking nonsense Arikawa Arikawa Mitamura Arikawa Mitamura Arikawa Arikawa Kohji Mitamura Mitamura Mitamura Mitamura Mitamura It's over Mitamura will be the monitor Of course - Great... - Serves you right Great, Yuka Great It's right after all Yuka voted for me That's my only vote What are you talking about? Of course Yuka will be the monitor Undoubtedly... Yuka, you look weird You look a bit depressed I want to resign from this position Why? I don't have the confidence Yuka, what are you talking about? We'll support you That's right... What a shame! It's all because of you that this college cannot be defeated That's why I am here to help Not realising that it's so bad Why, may I ask, did you opt for private lessons? I'm sorry Never mind That Yuka Mitamura is not good enough to be my match I'll teach her a lesson I'm here to say which is my favourite college I love Dai-ichi most Owing to examinations however everyone loses their own identity Well said... As the candidate for this term's chairman of the student union I will reignite our passion for freedom in the campus - Well said - We'll support you Quiet... Quiet, shut up What's freedom? What you call freedom is reckless waywardness Look at our campus it's filled with bad students who love to play pranks What are your feelings towards these disobedient students? This phenomenon exists because there's no more discipline - That's right - I want to set the rules of discipline And hence I've joined the election Great... Yuka, what are you looking at? Nothing, we can go now What do you think of Takasawa? In what respects? What she said is right, simply perfect But is this good? I've a feeling that something is bound to happen soon If someone's thoughts could get people to do as the thoughts command it's scary I don't know why Takasawa is like that She is respectable That Takasawa could even get the naughty ones to listen to her Really? An outstanding student in my class who imparts some sense of relief Teacher Yamagata Takasawa must be great at sports too How do you know if you don't try it out? And the chairman of the student union... Let Takasawa be the chairman Those violent students must be very unhappy now If our school had more students like Takasawa there'd be hope for our school, goodbye Results of the vote, 85 per cent A majority win We must take revenge Things will change soon Great Let's go - Have some tea - Alright The student union folks are looking for you, you'd better go now Campus Patrol, what is the meaning of this? This is Disciplinary Patrol which exercises correctional actions against misbehaviour Select Disciplinary representatives from this group 3 people in a group They should wear the same uniform In class during the day and when school ends, they should patrol the campus I think that's not necessary What does everybody else think? Ogawa I agree Who is against it? Ohki, you disagree? I... In any event, the majority supports this Then we'll decide on setting up the patrol guard Mitamura, you can be the patrol leader No, I'm sorry I can't Why didn't you object to it? That's right, I've elected you as the class monitor What is it? I'll be the first one to get caught Me too Takasawa is really great When you look into her eyes, you won't dare to object Will the patrol guard really be set up? Teacher Shimizu seems to have no objection to it Takasawa is really something She even has the design of the uniform ready They already decided on the banned items too It means the Parent-Teacher Asscn. will definitely agree to it Damn it, even the hamburger has became tasteless Well, give it to me then.. What's wrong with you? Damn, I'm so angry You must be tired of living Don't worry They'll soon get tired at playing policemen Then that'll be great But Takasawa seems to be quite serious about it Her behind... What is it? I'm so afraid when I think about it Here, found it - Come out - What's going on? Come over Don't run It's you What are you doing... - Go, go away - What do you want? Let me go What are you doing, it's too much - Don't run - What is it? Be careful - What's going on?... - Run, hurry and run You've broken the regulations Run Stop struggling, hurry and run - Go... - Come over Don't run Bring her over to me - You...come over - What's going on? - You broke the regulations - Why? Move What is it Let go of me What do you want? Stop messing around Let me go I'm so furious when I see this uniform Damn it, what is it? Beat them Beat them - Calm down - Teach them a lesson Calm down I want you to know the consequences of going against me Damn it, don't let them do as they please That's right My head aches What happened? Lemon Alright, calm down... You're too much Tonight I'll bring you to a very special tuition class That's called Eiko School Eiko School is the centre of the universe It has the power to change this college But don't tell anyone about it or you'll be dead Everyone, did you hear that? Don't be scared Be quiet and follow me You are the chosen ones You'll be reborn at the Eiko School today Your kids go to the tuition class too Yes, introduced by Mrs. Arikawa Ours are the same We didn't know how our parents suffered but it's getting better now Not only in studying kids are also getting less violent That's to say... Kohji, even if you don't help, you should at least work harder It's said that everyone is having private tuitions Although this will cost money I can afford it Go and have private tuitions too But, Dad It's not a class one could join as one pleases Dad, give me back my jacket - Kohji, you... - Give me back my hat too I won't go to tuition class I've had enough The patrol is effective Although those students being counseled have become calmer their results have progressed a lot Except the physical education studies Does it matter? Many parents called and thanked us Principal, the patrol is no good. Disband it But the students have become very disciplined There'd be no difference in treatment among the selected & non-selected students Those being counseled are bad students No, everyone is equal What a pity, righteousness has been abused What does that mean? For example During the war Self-defense troops If we divided them into the patrol and student trust will be gone Then the patrol leader would become the dictator What is it? Teacher Yamagata, not feeling well? If so, do you need to have some rest? No, I... Takasawa Are you alright? Mom What is it? Hi, how are you Please wait Yuka, Kohji called Yuka, the tenant called He said the Teacher has been sent to the hospital I'm not in a good mood for practice I want to gather everyone to visit teacher together See you later What is it? Teacher Yamagata has had an accident But... How come Nomura is so slow? Is something holding him up? Which room is teacher Yamagata in? You are his students He is sent to the recovery room after the operation He's accompanied by students, you could join them - Thank you - Take care Nomura is here first You should have said you'd come You're here too, Mitamura Mr. Takakura The hospital called just now informing us the situation of Yamagata - Takasawa? - Teacher hasn't recovered consciousness yet There's no point going in Why are you here? I've got the consent of director You'd better go back We want to see Teacher too You are too self-centered You'll know when the time comes Wait... Wait... - Open the door... - Teacher Yamagata I love you... Teacher Yamagata I love you... Teacher Yamagata Nomura It's bad Have to go now? Your lunch box Teacher Yamagata and Nomura are so pathetic How are they now? Yuka Murase Yuka, what's up? So painful... Go away Are you alright What happened I don't care now Wait... Teacher Takakura I've decided to trust my own ability I don't know what this is for either But someone has laid his eyes on this school I'll fight hard I believe what I am doing is right I think god will help me too Good Anyone knows what "lookout" means? Good Look out... Is there any other way to say it? Be careful Good Kohji, I also need your help You must help me - Are you Arikawa's mother? - Yes - Arikawa... - he has gone for private tuition Where is the class? He didn't tell me He said if he leaked this information it'd be trouble Examination is like war Right, want to eat? No Yuka The judgement is coming soon Open your eyes Join hands with me My dear Yuka I've come a long way to meet you Our souls are as one You are my lover Yuka, you're my lover Come Come with me Kohji, help me Kohji Yuka My pajamas Goodbye You sleepy head What's with you? I don't know I dreamed about fighting and then woke up aching all over What are you talking about? Always having strange dreams You should wear your pajama pants Damn, I thought it was a letter but it's the ad. of a tuition class Eiko School Yuka would not need to attend tuition class Next year she'll be in third grade she should make preparations for it now Dad, mom, I really can't think of the future right now Just living from day to day That's it then Finding yourself each day and living your life There's no routine Grandpa taught me this Live today well, then tomorrow will take care of itself Live the fuller life Dad and mom have confidence in you we are not worried at all I am so well loved Right Love means trust I must learn that Thank you Kohji, you protected me - I'll nurse you - What's the matter? Close your eyes Yuka, you look like my mom It's not painful anymore For you You need to protect me from now on - Yuka, what are you talking about? - Not yet asleep How's teacher Yamagata? You'd better worry about yourself Eiko School's information has been sent to your house I sent it A final word of advice Mitamura, join us or you'll die I'll seek revenge - I don't think that person... - He is not from this world You'll be in danger Don't go to Eiko School any more You are really hopeless It seems I am wasting my time Good bye Yuka, you should know about everything Teacher Yamagata and Nomura's accident are not accidents at all It's unbelievable that Master Takakura could fall down the stairs I must go and look at that tuition class I can't keep on doing nothing You can't go there The truth is you want to go yourself Yuka, I want to help you I also have supernatural power But I am only clear about your affairs Kohji Cheers... - Congratulations - Thanks Yuka is eighteen Had to rush to the hospital, so couldn't cook anything more decent Sorry, hope you don't mind It tastes great I love mom's sushi Luckily it's not serious Yes When Kohji called, I was almost scared to death My heart is still beating fast Let me see Dad, don't be like this Can't I? We bought this gift after discussing with dad You like pictures But there's none here I hope you'll pick the one you like I am eager to see what pictures you'll select Dad, mom, thanks I am so happy I am going to rest Yes, you had a shock today rest early Good night Good night I have a feeling that kid is getting more aloof I feel both hope and disappointment Don't go to the private tuition class Yuka, I've come from Venus Welcome the approach of night That star is the brightest in the darkness It symbolises the universe's intelligence I am here to save the earth Guiding the chosen ones Ietting them know the value of their existence What is my ideal universe like? At Eiko School we gathered together many friends They are increasing and then we can change the world Damn you We can't let you change the world Stupid fellow You fool whoever wants to strike me will end up like this What's the matter... Why treat me like this, why? I hate useless fellows like you Why? It'll be your turn Damn O' God please give me strength Yuka I am waiting for you Yuka, don't come over I beg you Save us Don't talk nonsense Go with me I won't It might not be worth anything to you but I like our earth as it is now I like the people here too If you keep saying things like that, you'd surely be dead I don't care not even for death Please return my friends to me Stupid fellow No, this is very important; more important to me than my own life I don't care about my own life, so... Shut up Yuka, you can't waste your superpower just like that Is it a waste to rescue people? You are not human You don't have the love humans possess I am the universe I am human I must fight you So, I must use human love to fight you then he'll become like this Damn it Yuka, go back, never mind me Kohji Don't move What's going on? This is the first time I've come across a human being like you I can't figure out your thoughts Buck up... Yuka, you have me staying with you I'll go back first Go back and think about what you've said Then one day... One day, I will definitely come back Arikawa Yuka, go Hurry, let's hurry and go Hurry Go home Go home Come back I'm back, Mom Fireworks Fireworks Fireworks You scared me I didn't realise that Takasawa is a girl who has lost her memory and has been under protection at Hokkaido She's disappeared for 3 months just like a novel No, it's more like a serial drama When she lost her memory she was a student of our college Yes I find it very strange The patrol was disbanded That's right, the student union was disbanded too A new one will be set up That's correct Like the free and raucous kind we had before are more child-like That's true Kohji's father! Teacher Yamagata, it's heard that you were seriously wounded You've recuperated? In no time So sorry, always giving you too much trouble - Kohji's father is bringing gifts to everyone - I was going to talk about Kohji with you I hope that he could try his best this time I'm looking forward to seeing his achievements Way to go... Over Way to go... - They won again - Give it your best shot... Way to go... - Everyone please try harder - Looks like we're going to win this time That's right Kohji from Dai-ichi School Way to go... Kohji, try your best... Kohji Take it easy, Kohji Go... Don't lose Kohji, go ahead Way to go... Oh god Way to go... Kohji, get up Begin Give it your best shot... Kohji, change position... Way to go... - Oh god, please - Come on... Be careful, Kohji Front Lose Are you alright? Anything wrong? Kohji Wake up, Kohji So painful... You are angry So sorry I've been praying very hard already but don't know why I suppose I have become normal again and - I don't have the superpower anymore - That's better That is to say... the college is at peace now And Kohji, if you don't have the power and yet you win there'll be more trouble I still hope that you can try hard everyday and let yourself become strong gradually I'd still prefer Kohji like that because Kohji will always rescue me So... Say something Why don't you say something? Say what? Idiot I have lost face in this competition I'll have a bad summer holiday There'll be hard training again Maybe you will win the next time I too have super power, Yuka Amazing There was once a Eiko School The first star Stars...you can see so many stars in this universe
