Yun-hui... Yun-hui. When will the snow die down? Dear Yun-hui. How are you? I wanted to ask you this for a long time. You might have forgotten me. It has been 20 years already. I suddenly wanted to reach out to you. You know, life's like that sometimes. You just can't hold it in anymore. Why aren't you leaving? I thought you went home. Do you want to go for a drive? Something wrong? Nothing. I'm just feeling under the weather. I can't go for a drive. Why not? Are you not feeling well? Yes, a little. What's wrong, exactly? Do you want to see a doctor? It's not that serious. You know, I'm into upcycling lately. I'm going to sew them and use them. You don't have much to do these days. I envy you. How is the university search going? I haven't started yet. What about the major? What do you want to study? I don't know yet. It will work out somehow. I envy your recklessness. Hey, I have worries too. You are late. You scared me. Do you work this late every night? I took the afternoon shift today. Why are you so harsh on yourself? You don't need to work this hard. You know, I'm tired. You never age. Yun-hui. You should tell me if you are seeing someone. Go back if you've already seen Sae-bom. I've already talked to her. She told me you've been really busy. I brought some dietary supplements... Let me go! Your drunk visit scares me. Uncle, I don't look like my mom, do I? You know, she's pretty. Can you turn your head slightly to your left? Good. Perfect. I think I look like my dad. You look like your mom. Really? Of course. Especially when you smile like that. Are you not interested in taking pictures of people? No, I only take pictures of beautiful things. That's profound. Uncle. Tell me about Mom. Is there any interesting story about her? About your mom? What story? I just want to make fun of her when I'm back home. An interesting story... An interesting story... Sae-bom. Did something happen to your mom? What? No, I don't think so. You are acting strange today. Why are you asking me about your mom? What's strange about it? Who else should I ask? Captain Park! Captain Park? Hi. - Dad. - I'm listening. Why won't you answer me? Why did you and Mom get divorced? Sae-bom, do you want some candy? Candy? I quit smoking. So you want to smoke a cigarette now. No matter what... we are... sorry for you. Not that again. Your mom is like... Right. She leaves people... Right. lonely. Dad. Yes. Be nice to that lady over there. I heard you were popular when you were young. Uncle told me. Did you go to see your uncle again? You know he develops my film for free. Next time, go somewhere else. Don't owe him. You'll have to pay back later. Sure. Mom, what do you live for? What has gotten into you? I'm just curious. What do I live for? I live for my daughter. Sure. You don't need to live for me anymore. I won't visit here often when I move to Seoul for university. That's disappointing to hear. Don't make me owe you. I know I have to pay you back later. Mom, do you know that Dad is dating someone? Mom! What? Do you know that Dad is dating someone? That's good. You should date someone, too. It doesn't feel fair. You are still decent! Seriously, what has gotten into you today? Why doesn't it snow? It's winter. What? Do you want to travel overseas? Somewhere where it snows a lot. All my friends told me they're going on a trip abroad with their moms. To be honest, we can afford that much, right? I have been saving my pocket money from Dad, too. What's wrong? I told you it's nothing. Go hang out in your classroom. I have upcycled this. My Christmas present for you. Let me know when you feel better. Are you asleep? I can't fall asleep. When you and Dad got divorced, do you know why I decided to live with you? Because you looked lonelier than Dad. I thought you wouldn't be okay living by yourself. But I got it wrong. I feel like I have been a burden on you. Are you going or not? The train is approaching. Please stand behind the yellow line. Dear Yun-hui. How are you? I wanted to ask you this for a long time. You might have forgotten me. It has been 20 years already. I suddenly wanted to reach out to you. You know, life's like that sometimes. You can't hold it in anymore. Do you remember my parents? Their marriage was toxic... And they ended it when I turned 20. My mom stayed in Korea and I moved to Japan with my dad. It's over. It is. Your mom said she would come to visit us. -Did you contact her? -Yes. She needs to consider her husband, I guess. It must be difficult for her to come all the way here. My dad sent me to my aunt after we had arrived in Japan. At least we used to have a chat on the phone every now and then. But I won't be able to do that any more. He passed away some time ago. Isn't it funny? I decided not to care about my dad a long time ago. But thanks to him, I'm writing this letter to you. Uncle Haruo was a funny man. When I was in middle school, I think he ran a business in Korea back then. He dropped by my place in Sapporo. He came into my room, totally drunk. Then made a bet with me. To give one's entire fortune to the one who can handstand for a longer time. He could have just given me some pocket money if he wanted to. Anyway, he was a funny man. When will the snow die down? Exactly. Every winter is a surprise. Remember my aunt, right? I used to tell you about her, Auntie Masako. I live with her in Otaru. She is very like me. She doesn't like people who speak loud. She doesn't like crowded places. She even likes nights where everyone is asleep. She is a good match for Otaru's winter. During winter in Otaru, we have the snow, the moon, the night and the silence. Sometimes I think that... you must be a good match for here, too. You'll like Otaru too just like me and my aunt. Jun, isn't it difficult to live in Japan? What do you mean? You used to live in Korea when you were young. If I were you, I would be missing Korea. It has been over 20 years since I moved to Japan. Right. I see. Are you going to marry someday? Do you want to meet a Korean guy? I know a really nice guy. No pressure, but why don't you go on a casual date with him? Not interested. Stop it. Or I'll get mad. He speaks fluent Japanese. Open the photos. His picture is at the top of it. I told you. I don't want to. I haven't had a dream about you for a long time. But strangely, I had one last night. Auntie, I'll walk back. Jun, where are you going? Jun, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, too. No worries. You are going through a difficult time. I wasn't being considerate enough. Ryuske. It's not like what you think. That's not why I'm being sensitive. Right... I see. I'm so sorry. We are almost there. Let me walk back home. I just want to be alone. I used to write you a letter whenever I had a dream about you. But I couldn't send those letters to you because you were married and had a family. So things I wanted to tell you just piled up in my heart. It always feels like the first time whenever I write a letter to you. I have been hesitating and time has passed since then. I was a coward. I ran away from you... and I still am. I'll probably write you another letter as if it's the first time. Hello? You picked up almost immediately. What are you doing now? Does Waru have a good appetite now? Yes. She can go home in a few days. That's a relief. It's lucky that you found it out early. Feline Tooth Resorption is an extremely painful condition for cats. And it's tricky to tell the status without a CT scan. Thank you so much. Oh, thanks to you, I found a good name for her, Waru. I was going to send her back if the owner shows up. Now that I have named her, it won't be easy. I wonder who lost... that little angel? You said that "Waru" means "moon" in Korean. Right? Did I? You did. That's right. Shall we give some late-night snacks to Waru? Where is she hiding? Waru! GREENWOOD VET Waru! Ryoko. Yes. Thank you for coming. You wanted to say something else. Would you like to go for a drink with me sometime? That would be nice. The moon is beautiful tonight. Did you arrive in heaven well? I'm back! Welcome home. Sorry, Auntie. I made you worry. Kujira... Did you have a long day, too? What is it? Jun. Yes? What? Come over here. What... I feel awkward. Quick. Are you all right? What has gotten into you? You are acting strange. Do you want me to hug you? Really? What's going on? I didn't expect this at all. It's better than I thought. It has been a long time. Let's stay like this for a while. It would be awkward if we don't. Am I being foolish? Am I still callow after all these years? Maybe I am. But I don't care. I'm not ashamed of writing this letter to you. Yun-hui. I have always... admired you. After I had met you, I came to realize what kind of person I was. Kujira... Sometimes I miss Korea. I would like to visit the town we used to live in and the school we used to go to. I wonder if my mom is doing well in Korea. And I wonder how you are doing too. I don't think I could get into a university in Seoul. Try a private prep institute in Seoul, then. I have already flunked out a year. It used to be my mom's. It was broken when I found it. So I fixed it. That's cool. I think I'll see if there's one like this at home too. Don't. Don't. Yun-hui. Are you in trouble these days? No, I'm not. Then why are you acting so odd? I'm worried. Can I... take some days off? No. You know that'll put me in trouble. Who's going to cover you? Please. I almost feel betrayed. You are really irresponsible. OK, then. You can take some days off. But I can't guarantee you will still have your job when you're back. What are you talking about? I can't wait for you. It is beyond my power. I get it. Sorry? Don't wait for me, then. Let's have some alone time in the morning. What do you have up your sleeve this time? I think I'll sleep in every morning. All right. As you wish. I'll pop down to a convenient store! Okay. What? We are not in Korea! Be careful! All right. Don't worry! Hey, Sae-bom! Here! Nice room. I looked through every guesthouse in this town. It's freezing. The only downside is that... It is freezing. It's not that cold. The heater is on. Have you found anything? Well, it was just a house. A two-story house. -You went there? -Yes. There were an old lady, a middle-aged woman, and a cat. That's all. How did you find about the cat? A strange moving silhouette caught my eyes, and it was a cat. I could hear its sound. Do you want to go inside? Their coffee is good. No, I'll come back. I'm not sure if I'm handling it right. By the way, what's up with this house? Who are the people living here? They are Mom's friends. Why didn't you just ask your mother about them? It's complicated. Hey, where are you going? What? That's the wrong direction. I knew it. I'm back. Welcome back. Another SF novel? By the way, Auntie. Were you in my room recently? Yes, I put back the clean clothes in your room. Have you seen a letter then? I thought I put it on my desk but I couldn't find it. A letter? I don't think I have seen one. I'm tired. Shall we head back home? Sae-bom. Sae-bom? Where did you go in the morning? I just took a stroll. Nice coat. Where did you get it? Does it look good on me? Yes, it does. Why don't you dress up like that in Korea? What? What? What's the matter? Hand me your lighter. What? I know you smoke. How did you figure it out? I'm your mom. I'm sorry, Mom. I smoke only occasionally. Quit smoking. I will. By the way, do you smoke, too? Only occasionally. Mom. Will you get mad at me? Please don't. What? Can I smoke one, too? Who did you take after? Uncle told me that I take after you, Mom. I'm confiscating this. Don't. You look pretty. Oh, the full moon. What did he say? Is there something in the sky? I think he said, "the full moon". Did you have a relationship before you met Dad? I did. Oh, really? What kind of person? Come on. Answer me. It always smelt good when I was around. That's it? Tell me more. Let's get out. It's not good to stay in the bath for too long. You're cheap. Why don't you go and see a doctor? What? Your wrist. You always rub your left wrist. Oh, really? Have you not noticed? I haven't. You should go see a doctor when we go back home. Are we there yet? Where in the world did you book us? We're almost there. Welcome. Text me! Isn't this place nice as well? It's better to experience different places when you travel. It's nice, but a bit freezing. I was given that camera instead of going to university. Sorry? Back then, your grandparents only supported your uncle to go to university. Your grandmother felt sorry for me and got me that camera in secret. How come you never told me? Is it okay for me to have it? I don't use it anymore. Let's go out. I'm hungry. Do they have a delivery service here? It's so cold. Mom. There's a closed-down railway track here. We can't see it because of the snow though. Would you take a photo of me? Are you asking me? You have the perfect posture. I guess you did photography back in the days. What? One more? I'm back. Welcome back. I'm so tired. Hey, Auntie. Another SF novel? I'm hungry. Auntie, why don't you go out and socialize a bit? Wait. You should date someone. At my age? Have you ever been in a relationship? I have when I was young. Oh, with who? He was a middle school teacher. It smelt like toilet air freshener when I was around him. What? -Toilet air freshener? -That's right. The cinema he used to go to smelt like toilet air freshener. He liked films that much. You have such a good memory. Why didn't you marry him then? Because I didn't like watching films. Are you kidding me? Only for that reason? I think of him every now and then. We went out for only about six months. Now that I'm approaching the end of my life, I guess I haven't forgotten him for my entire life. Do you want a pair of gloves? Why do you only wear one of them? It's sort of meaningful. A gift from your boyfriend? Sorry? You have a boyfriend, Gyeong-su. I got goosebumps. How on earth do you know his name? You were pretty loud when you were chatting on the phone. Why didn't you tell me you knew? I have been waiting for you to open up. Sae-bom. Yes? As you already know, an old friend of mine lives in this town. Really? I had no idea. So what? Did you meet your friend? Not yet. That wasn't bad. When will the snow die down? What's the point of saying that? You have been living here for years. You know it won't stop soon. Honestly, I feel stuck. It's kind of a spell. When it snows, we clean it up. Then it snows again. Again, we clean it up and it snows... We are helpless in the face of nature. Take some rest, Auntie. I'll quickly finish it. CAFE Welcome. Jun Katase? Good morning. Coffee, please. Oh, coffee. Okay. You shouldn't come here. My mom might find out. Sure. Go back in. Come over here. What's the matter? Hurry. What now? Can I hug you for once? What is this about? Come here. What is this? This is so nice. Idiot. Sae-bom? Hello, ma'am! Gyeong-su is on a vacation here too. You must be out of your mind, right? I apologize. Don't tell him off. I asked him to come. He said he would travel by himself and go back. You don't seem to be patient. Is it that hard being apart for a few days? Please don't. I should get going. Have a pleasant trip! I'm sorry, Mom. So what is he doing now? I don't know. He must be hanging around somewhere. Poor thing. In the end, he is a precious son of his family. It doesn't matter. It was him who insisted. What are you doing? I'm trying to cool my head off. I have been thinking a lot these days. I'm boiling. Go out and have some fun. What about you? It's all right. Are you serious? Bom, I love you. I'll be a better person. How could you run away, then? I already told you I'm sorry. Can you move to your left a little bit? Be spontaneous. Anyway, it's nice to be together, isn't it? Got it. Can you just take a photo? The sun is going down. I took the photo. I'm not sure if it's working though. Just check the numbers here. It was eight and now it's nine. So it's working. What's the manual for? Stop nagging me. So what are you going to do? What? I'm moving to Seoul for university. I know. Of course, you should. You've always wanted to go. You can make it. Won't you stop me? Why would I? There are only a few things that I can do for you... I shouldn't be a burden on you. Are you that confident? What do you mean? Thank you. I find that a lone customer tends to smoke. Are you here for sightseeing? A friend of mine lives in this town. Oh, I see. Have you already met your friend? I'm sorry. Would you repeat that? Have you already met your friend? I have. It has been long. So we had a nice meal together... We took a stroll together... And I visited her place. I see. When did you start smoking? I have been smoking since I was 19. So you were a wild one. You are a good person. You, too. I felt it the moment I first saw you. Did you? I feel so comfortable when I'm with you. I think we are similar. I'm sorry. I think I'm drunk. In what way are we similar? I just have the feeling. Why are you not dating anyone? Ryoko. Yes. I don't want to be rude. And I might have misunderstood you. But I'll squeeze my courage and spit it out. I have been living my life... trying to hide that my mother is Korean. Because it doesn't help me. In other words, I have been hiding my identity all along. If you have been hiding something, keep hiding it. Do you understand... what I'm talking about? Please pick it up. Hello, Auntie. I'm sorry. I forgot to tell you. I'm with my friend. Yes, a friend. Do you know why I decided to live with my dad when Mom and Dad were separated? Why is that? Because he didn't pay attention to me. But Mom was different. She cared a lot about me. And she blamed herself because of me. This photo... Did your mom take it? No. Yun-hui took it. Yun-hui. These days... I see her in my dreams. What kind of dreams? It's just... We are together in my dream. Actually, Yun-hui's daughter was here. What? Sae-bom. Do you even know her name? And you didn't tell me about her? I'm telling you now. Come on. Tell me more. She said, she wanted to meet you tomorrow. -Tomorrow? -Yes. Me? What an odd kid. Good morning. I have always wanted to meet you. I have heard a lot about you from my mom. Have you? Oh, my mom didn't come with me this time. I came here with my friend. I see. If it's not inappropriate to ask... What are you going to do tonight around 6 p.m.? May I take you to dinner? Dinner? Yes, dinner. Can you say yes? Actually, my friend left me alone after a small argument. And I'm not used to traveling by myself... I don't want to spend the last day of my trip in a guesthouse... I have traveled so far to come here... Where are you, Mom? In the guesthouse? I'm outside. Sorry that I left you alone on the last day. Do you want to meet in front of the canal clock tower at 6 p.m.? You know where it is, right? Is it you, Yun-hui? What the hell are you doing? Oh, you are here. I'm confiscating it. Why? Don't smoke. You don't even know how to. It'll be nice if we smoke together. Don't. Don't! Where are you going? Let's go out! It's our last night! It has been a long time. That's true. Auntie. What are you doing? Coming. When will the snow die down? Dear Jun. How are you? I'm writing back to you as soon as I received your letter. I'm not a good writer like you but I'm trying. First of all, I hope your father rests in peace. What are you up to? Your mother is here. Smile a little. One, two. Thank you. Your letter didn't make me uncomfortable. I thought about you often and I missed you, too. I used to be truly happy when we were together. I may not feel it again for the rest of my life. I didn't do anything. One more, please. It's hard to believe that it all happened such a long time ago. That day, I genuinely meant to break up with you. My parents thought that I was sick when I told them I loved you. So I had to see a psychiatrist. Sae-bom is a good photographer. She is. Were you on a trip? We were. Where did you go? Do I need to tell you everything? What are you going to do with a passport photo? I'm going to use it for my resume. I'm looking for a job. Is the work in the factory hard? Do you want me to find a new position for you? I'll figure it out myself. How will you figure it out? You have no special skills, or experience. I'm leaving this town with Sae-bom. What has gotten into you this time? I came by to say goodbye. You little swine! Goodbye. I ended up marrying a man my brother fixed me up with. I don’t want to use my unfortunate past as an excuse in this letter. I didn’t have other options back then. I ran away too, like you. I didn't drink. I'm not lying. I just came by to give you something. Do you want to go and talk? I'm just worried that Sae-bom might hear us. To where? It won't take long. Yun-hui. You are the very first person to hear. I felt the need to do so. WEDDING INVITATION Congratulations. I'm so happy for you. Don't tell Sae-bom yet. I'll tell her by myself. I won't. Please be happy. Please. Lee Eun-young. What a pretty name. So this is her name. It is. She looks nice. She seems to have a lot of love. Sure. I'm really happy for you. Sure. Why are you crying? You are delivering the good news. I'm sorry. You should be happy, too. Sure. Stop crying. It may sound funny, but on my wedding day, it was you who came up in my mind first. When strangers wished me happiness, I truly prayed for your happiness even though you left me. It's me. A selfie with a film camera? I was bored. It looks nice. Mom! Come over here! Check this out! Check out what? Just for a second! You look so cool. - Do I? - Absolutely. Don't say random things to my mom. How on earth is there not a single photo of you smiling? Neither is yours. Jun. I thought the rest of my life was a punishment. I have been punishing myself all along. You wrote that you were not ashamed of yourself. I wish I wouldn't feel ashamed of myself anymore. You're right. We didn't do anything wrong. FINAL EDUCATION: HIGH SCHOOL -Hi. -Hi. Are you writing a resume? You are mean. I won't look at it. I'll make money and learn the business, then open a small restaurant. A restaurant? Yes. You are the very first person to hear. When did you come up with the idea? I'm sure you'll be good at it! It suits you so well. It'll take some time. Lastly, I'll tell you about my daughter. Her name is Sae-bom. She will become a university student soon. I'll keep supporting Sae-bom until there's nothing left to study. Until she says she wants to stop. Although there's your address on the envelope, I'm not sure if I can send you this letter. It would be nice if I could be courageous enough. I should get going. My daughter will come back home soon. Will I be able to tell her about you some day? I want to be courageous. I'll be able to be courageous. Mom! What? Is that the one? It seems like it. Are you nervous? P.S. I dream about you too.
