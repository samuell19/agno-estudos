My name is Xiong Dun. Xiong, like "bear." Dun, like Newton. Tomorrow, I'll be turning 29. Alexander Bell invented the telephone when he was 29. Murakami started writing novels when he was 29. Spielberg directed Jaws when he was 29. And at 29, Steve Jobs introduced the Macintosh. I believe the next 29-year-old to influence the world has to be me! If the butterfly effect does exist, then I think I must be the butterfly that could flap its wings and change the world. Hey, you! Do you have a death wish? Go. Hurry up! Fine, you got me. As for this city, I'm no butterfly. Maybe a moth at best. Perhaps for most girls, success means having the perfect wedding. But that's not me. We gather here today to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony. If anyone has any objections, please speak now or forever hold your peace. Sorry. If no one objects, all right. Excuse me. I had to work late. I didn't miss anything? I said you didn't have to come. This is way too important to miss. Through good times and bad, in sickness or health... To be honest, if it wasn't for leaving a good impression, I'd be home sleeping right about now. Look over here. Smile. Okay. Cousin and cousin-in-law, I'm Xiong Dun. - You're Chuan's girlfriend, right? - That's me! You're really pretty! You've got a loose thread. Sorry. I pulled too hard. It's a loose thread. It really was a loose thread. If you're tired, you can go home and sleep. No one would mind. No, I'm okay. Why would I be tired? I'm doing this for you. Right? That poop-haired lady, is that the groom's mom? That's my mom. I'm sorry. I should go say hello. That's okay. More eating. Less talking. Here, this is for you. It will guarantee a happy marriage in the near future. There are two types of bosses in the world. There are only two kinds of men in this world, dumb ones and dumber ones. Cowards and cheaters. Which one would you choose? And a Virgo on top of all that, now that's one of a kind. My boss is like that. Right on her chin, there's a huge mole. She spends all day covering it up. The harder she tries, the more obvious it is. Stop trying to hide it. I mean, what's the point? Where is my applause? I just love champagne. Damn it. She is so freaking heavy! Lao Zheng is a woman. She's a small business owner and amateur boxing enthusiast. Her punches are steady, accurate and fierce. And she's the same as a person. Your typical Beijing chic. When she's around girls, she's manly. And when she's around guys, even manlier. She loves plaid shirts, dislikes pretty dresses. Wherever she goes, a trail of screams follow. Let me go. I can walk by myself. Stop messing around. Amy, my BFF and roommate. Born smack in the middle of the Yangtze River Delta area. She likes astrology and loves tarot cards. She likes Korean dramas and loves American shows. She loves selfies... but no peace signs, please. Loves working, hates overtime. Even though she always has to. You got it now? She is a Japanese company actuary with an insanely unreasonable boss. That's why she's always exhausted. Push! Just a little more! Push! Well, okay. I made up that last part. But it really, really is that bad. Holy crap! Damn, that's exhausting. You always mess with me at the most important parts. Play. That's my man! Move. I'm here to protect you. Step back. Me and my love are going zombie killing! Demons, back away! Amy, I'm really sorry. - Gotta go. - Lao Zheng! There are people inside. Let's hide for a while. I would rather be killed. It's not safe outside. Oh, my God. When did you come in? Xiao Xia asked you if you remember what day today is? It's deadline day! How many did I tell you to finish last time? Procrastination! There's something wrong with you, right? Nothing's wrong with me. What's the matter with you? Nothing. What are you saying? Are you out of your mind? That wasn't a question. Last time you said to finish five, so I put in more hours and finished it. It's all done. More hours? Doing what, goofing around? Last time I said seven! You said five! I'm sure of it. No way I could finish seven, so I wouldn't have agreed. Are you saying that it was my mistake? Huh? If you're not interested, then you can get out. A lot of people are waiting for your spot. What, you think I wanna be here... right? Okay, let's continue. Xia, say something. Honey. I guess you're still in that meeting. Message me back when you're done, okay? Miss you. This is good. Waitress, clean it up. What are are you doing? There are a lot of people here. You're so bad. Be quiet for a second. She just called me. I didn't even answer. Let me call her back. What are you doing, sweetheart? Answer the phone. What are you doing, sweetheart? Xiong Dun! Xiong Dun! Xiong Dun! Xiong Dun! Xiong, happy birthday! As expected, I gotta work overtime. Sorry I can't come. We'll celebrate another day. Xiong, the manager is dragging everyone to dinner. You're lucky you got away. Gotta go. We'll talk tomorrow. Xiong, I've got a game tomorrow. You guys have fun. I'll head over after the match. MOM Mom. Sweetheart, happy birthday! Thanks, Mom. You guys finished decorating? Yes, we just finished. We're letting it air out. Next time you're back, you could stay at our new house. Is Dad there? Yeah, he's here. Papa Xiong, come here. Our daughter is on the phone. Coming. Your dad is messing with his plants again. Hurry up. Hurry. Dun, honey. Happy birthday! I asked around, there are plenty of good jobs for you here. You should come back. It's better here. The air is fresh. It's her birthday today. Stop with your blabbering. Your dad, he's always so chatty. How are you celebrating today? I'll be with... Lao Zheng, Xiao Xia and Amy. They bought a huge cake for me. Don't eat too much cake. Sugar isn't good for you. I know, I know. We're gonna go now. Talk soon. Bye. Okay. I'LL SEE YOU THERE. Surprise! May your fortune rise as high as the sky We wish you a happy birthday Come on. Picture time! You guys suck. If you guys showed up later, I probably would've killed myself. It's just a job. Coward. I didn't see you stand up for me today. Well, let this one go. He did a good job preparing your party. Very dependable. Here. Take these. How's this gift for ya? How did you guys find out? The jerk was showing off on his profile. What? His dream is finally coming true. What a dick. We never liked that jerk actually. Never got what you saw in him. Now, you tell me... Amy, how about the jerk you're dating? Let's make him a target too. That's right, Amy. How could I forget you? If we had a jerk competition, you'd win for sure. Let me tell you, if it were up to me, I pretend single. When she found out about it, he'd say he's got marriage problems. I'd slap the shit out of him. All right, okay, everybody, Today is a day for celebration. We should talk about something more cheerful. Xiong, for you. Hey, listen. I wrote this song. I love it. You should quit your stupid job like I did. Let's start fresh, together. Xiong, I don't think that was quitting. You were fired! Say it again! Stop, stop. Or else you can kiss your present goodbye. Wow. That's more like it. Why is it so light? Did you write me a check? LOTTO TICKET Holy... Xiao Xia, thanks a lot. Man, you're generous. Let me tell you, I've been saving those numbers for a long time. You know how much the winning pot is now? Over 200 million! This would have worked normally, but today is the worst day of my life. Silly girl. All this means that your luck's about to turn around. I think so too. I really hope my bad luck ends right now. When life sucks, most of the time, you can only share only so little. As for the rest, just tell them to go away. That's right! Let them all just go away! Cheers! Go away, bosses! Go away, jerks! Go away, overtime! Go away, smog! Go away... landlord. You don't have to start over after every breakup. Save it for the next guy. It works just the same. Exactly. This is your third time taking it apart, right? Fourth. You ain't cool enough. Well, you seriously lack culture, dude. Do I really need to explain myself? Let the past be the past. I bought a blouse online. It's gorgeous! I gotta show it to you guys. Hold on a second. Narcissist. Xiong! Xiong! Xiong Dun! Xiong Dun! Xiong Dun! Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you PEKING UNIVERSITY INTERNATIONAL HOSPITAL Show this to the chief, please. Okay. Judging from his big eyes and long eyelashes, there's an 80% chance he's hot. You're awake. What are you looking at? Don't pretend to be innocent after that punch. Did I do that? Some punch. Almost sent my flying. Oops, sorry. - Does this hurt? - No. Do I need to take off my bra? No. This is fine. Doctor, test results. The boxing champ is awake. Let's do a biopsy too. Before we have a diagnosis, I suggest you stay here for monitoring. Stay here at the hospital? And you're responsible for me? What's your name? My name is Dr. Liang. A spot just opened up. I'm going to get you an inpatient form to fill out. Rest up. Did you see him? So damn hot! You guys see his fingers? Long and sexy. Come on, what sign do you think he is? Is he married? You're thinking too much! You're in the hospital, Xiong. Everything is gonna be okay. - Maybe not. - Are you serious? Of course not. Go to my place and bring me my best mascara. And in my closet, the first one on the left. The red dress, the one that shows my goodies. Get that for me and I'll be just fine. Nurse, who's gonna do my checkup? Is it gonna hurt? Should be Boss Liang. It's usually him. Boss? You mean Dr. Liang? Yeah. He's the boss? He's not, but we call him the boss because he's always so serious. Maybe it's because he grew up abroad. None of us seem to have things to say with him. Do I need to undress for this? - Of course. - Really? You don't have to do it now. Wait till he gets here. All right. Young lady, it's your lucky day. Our chief is going to do your checkup today. You're awake? Who are you? Get down! Get down! Little brat! I'm gonna... Mao Dou. Daddy! Come here. Who told you to leave your bed? You're bed 23? Hello. Mao Dou, say hi to this nice lady. Oh, no, that's all right. Your name is Mao Dou? You're so adorable. What's your name? My last name is Xiong. Xiong, like "bear." Bear! Stop it. Okay, go play with big sister. I'm going to pay the bill. What does your dad do? My daddy's in big business! Big business? Bear! You little brat. Aren't you full of energy. Isn't that right? Come here, let's fight. Xiong Dun, right? Are you okay here? Are you sleeping well? Everything is fine. How do you feel? My chest feels a little tight. And sometimes... I want to cough. If you could come and visit me more often, then I'd feel a lot better. If you come visit me more often, I'd feel a lot better. Little brat! Mao Dou, stop copying what adults say. Got it? Bear, stop copying what adults say. Got it? Dr. Liang. Get some rest. Boy. You're a boy. You don't have boobs, so you're a boy. See, they're right here. Fake. If my daddy squeezed hard enough, he'd have them too. Boys have them too, so we know what's front and what's back. Are yours for the same reason? Xiong, how can you stand this kid? Now you feel my pain. It's time for my examination. You guys can take off anytime. Bring some yummy food. Sure thing. What are you looking at? Go away. Mao Dou, I'll play with you. Let's sword fight. What, am I wrong for telling you not to smoke in the room? This is a hospital. What's your problem? I was smoking in the bathroom. That's still in the hospital. The smoke goes everywhere. If you don't care if you die, that's your problem. We don't want to die. No manners. No morals. Happy? - What's your problem? - Forget it. There're a lot of people watching. Let's go. I don't want that. Let me tell you... Mom... Try not to move, no matter how painful it is. Otherwise we have to do it over again and it'll hurt even more. The first time is always the worst. You'll get used to it. Let me help you. I can distract you from the pain. Bear, tell me a story. That's a crappy solution. I'm hurting and you want me to tell you a story? You got no sympathy, kid. No, I don't... What's sympathy? Come on, tell me a story. I'm bleeding. The doctor told me not to bleed. Lie down. Hurry. What happened? This is what we were worrying about. I tripped and fell. Okay. Lie still. Stop talking. Stay in your bed and don't move around so much. Don't worry, I won't tell my dad. Thanks. Mao Dou, do you know what you have? I don't know. But after I got shots, all my hair fell out. Acute myeloid leukemia. Lymphocytic leukemia. Chronic granulocytic leukemia. MISS YOU FOREVER No way... I won't let you die. Don't ever leave me. You're a heartless girl! Big brother... I have one last wish. I'd fulfill not one, but a hundred, a thousand, or even a million of your wishes. Tell me! I'm sorry. What do you think of my cleavage? Sexy enough? You think I should pull it down more? More? Any further and I'd see your belly button. Although I must say, your persistence really is quite moving. But this is a hospital. Come on. Nowadays, love has no boundaries. Why would time or place stand in my way? Remember, a woman needs to always stay beautiful, both inside and out. If you were to get hit by a car, they would always rescue the pretty ones first. Never mind, you wouldn't understand anyways. That's him right there. Liang Junbo. Let's go find this Liang guy. Yeah, that's right. Take a picture. Zoom in more. Don't look back! Don't ask why. Just come with me. - Why are you dressed like this? - Don't say anything. Hurry up! Oh, my God! That was really close. There are these scary guys looking for you. Looking for me? But I've always been good to my patients. Yeah, but misunderstandings happen. It's not always up to you. Are you wearing perfume? Yep. You like it? You're not thinking about leaving the hospital, right? Nah. I... Look at my eyes. I've got fake lashes on too. You putting on makeup would affect my judgments on your condition. For example, looking at a patient's eyes and nails to determine the state of a patient's illness. Initial observations are very important for a doctor's diagnosis. I understand. Even without makeup, you're still pretty. Really? So you like the makeup-free me, huh? I think a lot of women are actually prettier when they don't wear makeup. Oh... Dr. Liang. Your heart is racing. Are you all right? Hypoxia. A lack of oxygen will cause an increase in heart rate. Is it me, or is it a little stuffy in here? - They should be gone by now, right? - Wait! Hold on a second. Let me listen. Just a minute. It's so hot in here. The biggest tragedy in life is when you should have held it in, but you didn't. This is not what it looks like. Come on, let's go. We didn't see anything. Even in a place like that. It really isn't what you're thinking. Let me go sort this out. Will you please go back and lie down? Please. Liang Junbo. What do you want? I've been watching for a while now. This is a civilized society. So, what, you wanna play rough? It's a misunderstanding. You're Dr. Liang, Mao Dou's oncologist? Yes. What's the matter? We're Cui's friends. We heard that Mao Dou is going to have an operation. So, we collected some money for Cui. We were afraid that he wouldn't accept it, so it's better to just give it to you directly. Mao Dou's cross-matching was unsuccessful. He can go home for the time being. Daddy, I don't want to grow up. That way, you'll never get old. Silly boy, did you forget? Dad knows magic. When you grow up, I'll use magic to make myself as young as you. Then why can't you cure me? Promise me you'll sleep well tonight. Come tomorrow morning, I'll use my powers to get you out of here and bring you home. - Really? - Really! I can go home now! Yes. Yep, let's go home. I can leave and go home now! Bear, I can leave now! I've never met Mao Dou's mother, nor have I heard about Cui's story. But one thing I know for sure is that he's a wonderful father. Xiong, you must be mad because I get to get better before you do. Oh, it's the worst. Without you here messing with me all the time, I'd feel lonely. Xiong, are you going to die? Do you know what dying is? Of course I do. Dying is just sleeping for a long, long time. It's what my grandma told me. Then are you afraid of sleeping for a really, really long time? I like sleeping, it's comfortable. And I wouldn't have to get shots. I'd wake up eventually. Right? Right. You will wake up one day, for sure. Xiong, can you tell me a story? I promise I'll never bully you again. Sure. Story time! Let's see, what story should I tell? A long, long time ago, there was a little boy who knows magic. His name was Mao Dou. Hey, he has the same name as me! Yep, that's right. One day, Mao Dou had awoken from a beautiful, sweet dream, and realized the world around him was perfectly tranquil. The sky was unbelievably blue. Mao Dou was wearing the coolest, newest clothing. He ran through the streets. He ran, jumped and ran until he came to a garden. Inside that garden, there were beautiful, colorful flowers everywhere. But there were a few kinds. A monster appeared and Mao Dou struck back. Do you like it? Here, for you. This is awesome. Thank you, Xiong! Let me tell you a secret. Dr. Liang's girlfriend died from a disease! It's true. I heard it from the head nurse. She's so scary, I don't think she tells lies. I can only help you so much. The rest is up to you. Mao Dou. Let's go home. Let's go. Time to go home! - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye! Let's go. Sometimes, living in your own imagination is a rather wonderful thing. You wouldn't have a worry in the world. No fears. No grief. Not even death. It's you. Why are you out so late? I couldn't sleep. I came out for some moon-bathing. No way. The nurse tells me that out of all the patients, you're the one who eats the most and sleeps the best. Who told you that? Bad-mouthing me on purpose. She's obviously jealous of my stunning looks. Do I have the same disease as Mao Dou? Patients must avoid thinking too much. It's like this. It's my responsibility to treat you and your responsibility to believe in me. Let's wait for the results to come back. So, I'm really gonna believe you now. My life is in your hands now. Pinkie swear. You don't know pinkie swear? Even a 3-year-old knows. Here. Like this, then stamp. This way, if you don't keep your promise, I'll curse you to remain single for the rest of your life. That's harsh. How long have you been a doctor? Seven years now. What about you? What do you do? Right now, I draw to make a living. An artist. That's good. Better than us. It's tough being a doctor. There's so much risk but rarely a sense of accomplishment. That's easy. Treat me! I'm the best at making people feel accomplished. How can you do it? I feel like anything and everything can make you happy. I'm silly. When I was in college, no one took me seriously. Happy or not, we still have to live on, one day at a time. So just live life to its fullest without a care in the world. Yeah. That makes sense. If it makes sense, then why are you still so serious? That's right. You have no idea how important a doctor's smile can be for us patients. So take it from me, learn to smile and grin at yourself in the mirror. Because when you smile, you're so handsome, you make me wanna take off... I really want to stab myself a few times. Watch your mouth! Take off my old identity and be reborn again. You wanted to say, take off your clothes? Hello? Okay. I'll be right there. It's been fun talking to you. I gotta go work. Get some sleep. You guys should contact Xiong Dun's parents soon. It's better if they're here. What does she have? Her condition is very complicated. So it's best if her parents are here, so we could talk about it together. Okay? Please tell us how she's doing so we have an idea. I know you care about her a lot. Dr. Liang, please don't move. This is for your own good. She was the biggest badass of our neighborhood. They used to call her Miss Tyson. DIAGNOSIS: NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA I don't think we should tell her unless it's absolutely necessary. What if she couldn't handle it and just gives up hope altogether? Xiao Xia, if you were the one who's sick, would you rather find out now, or later, or be kept in the dark the whole time? If it was me, I would rather know it sooner... Never mind. You shouldn't ask me. You can never decide on anything. It's useless asking you. How about we vote on it? Raise your hand if you agree to tell her now. Xiao Xia, are you going to raise your hand or not? Why are you here? I am starving. Excuse me. Hello. Can I help you? This one. This too. Quickly. - Okay. It'll be right out. - Thanks. Are you crazy? Can you eat all that? I mean, you only live once, right? One meal eaten is one meal less. I want to tell you guys something. - I really hit the jackpot this time. - 200 million? Dude, where is the context? Pay attention, please. So you know? It was cleverness that killed the cat, not curiosity. Xiong, we've asked around. It's not that big of a deal. On a tumor scale, this only ranks number 10 on the chart. Tumor? What tumor? I thought you already knew? I have a tumor? It's not leukemia? Oh, thank God! I thought I had leukemia! Really. Thank God and Buddha! Why do you look so worried? It's a tumor. Just cut it off! From now on, I'm gonna be healthy! No more laziness. No more junk food. When I'm all better, I'm going to work out everyday for two hours. No, for three hours! I'm in the middle of an IV injection. You guys eat this junk food. You totally know her. Look at her. "It's a tumor. Just cut it off." Come on, dude! Have you forgotten all your bio classes? It's lymphoma. Lymph nodes are all over the body. "Cut it off." How about I cut you off! What are you looking for? Xiong Dun wants to watch The Walking Dead. I made a DVD for her last time. Why can't I find it? And her comic books too. Come get something to eat first. You didn't eat much for lunch. Amy, you too, come eat something. I'm not hungry. What's the matter? Are you okay? How can I be okay? My best friend is laying in the hospital. Lao Zheng, don't... Shut up! Eat your noodles. Could you be any louder eating those damn noodles! GO AWAY MR. TUMOR! What do you mean? You've already done it! Why are you calling me now and pretending to be a good guy? You're such a jerk! Answer the phone! Her name is Xia Meng. She was kicked out of her old room and has become my roommate. Whenever the sound of a retro Vespa is heard, she appears a few minutes later. She rarely smiles. When she's not on the phone, she barely speaks. And when she's on the phone, the cursing almost never ends. She would always receive flowers and fruit baskets, but no one has ever visited. So the flowers go in the trash and the fruit is left there to rot. Go ahead. I don't know why, but it doesn't matter what Meng says. I always feel an impulse to say, "Yes, ma'am." What is it? I have bestowed these upon thee. How dare you not accept? Thank you for your kindness, Your Highness. Doctor, can you please help me? You see, I'm looking for... Uh-oh. I knew this day would come, but I didn't expect it to come so soon. UNKNOWN CALLER - Hello? - Hi, Mr. Xiong. I'm your daughter's friend. She's sick. She's in the... Liar. Bamboo eight. Hello? Mr. Xiong, please don't hang up. Xiong Dun shaved her head at six. She tried to shave like you and cut her lips. And one summer, your brought her to a farm to watch an irrigation plane, but almost lost her. And before she turned 16, she weighed her heaviest at 180 pounds. Who is this? Let my daughter go! This is a systemic disease. It's very hard to treat. Within five years, the survival rate is no more than than 20%. What we can do now is sessions of systematic chemotherapy to prolong life. However, migraines, hair loss, these are side effects of the chemo. So don't be too nervous. Our goal for late-stage cancer patients is to improve their quality of life and prolong the time they have left. Go be with her. I'm going to buy some stuff. It's no problem. You'll get better. You're always too rebellious. Do you remember? What I tell you every time I call you. You have to eat well and bundle up when it's cold. You always wear so little. You never listen. You always sleep so late and wake up even later. You'd draw for hours and hours without eating or drinking. Nobody could take that. What happened to your mouth? Give it to me! Give it to me! How many times did I say? Your father's side has diabetes, can't eat sweets. Maybe you got sick from all this carelessness. Please stop nagging me. I'm already like this. It's only a piece of chocolate. I'm sorry. I won't eat it again. You have to change. Listen to me. When you get well, you should come back home. Stop messing around in this city. I'm not going back. I've just started my career here. What career? It's been how many years since you graduated? If you don't go back, your dad and I will sell the new apartment and move here to live with you. That would drive me crazy, Mom. You taking care of yourself drives us crazy. Okay. Who's up? Don't look at the records. Through two mediastinal biopsies, the pathology shows non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. PET-CT shows a high metabolite of the anterior mediastinal has infected parts of the lung and pericardium. We are starting two cycles of MA chemotherapy. After two cycles, the evaluation is... The evaluation is PR. It's important to be familiar with a patient's conditions. This is fundamental. Especially with the patient's specificity, you have to remember it all the time. From now on, no one is allowed to read from the records when visiting patients. Xiong Dun, how do you feel? I'm fine. Are your urination and defecation normal? Why are you asking a girl such question this early in the morning? Stop fooling around. The doctor is talking to you. Be serious. Normal. I thought no one could control you. Why do I need to be controlled? I'm a really well-behaved girl. I think you're really imposing today, kind of like a Mob boss. Are they all afraid of you? Why would they be afraid of me? I don't bite. Are you guys afraid of me? No. Why are you laughing? Don't just laugh because someone else is laughing. Laughter should come from the heart. Right, Xiong Dun? Yep. This is Xia Meng. Who's turn is it? I'll do it. Xia Meng's immunophenotype is B-PLL. Her peripheral leukocytes are more than 100,000. The bone marrow is diffused by naïve lymphocytes. They are also present in other organs. We've been using the CHOP plan once every three weeks, CTX for one day and VCR with a maximum of no more than 2 mg. Also, she's been taking PDN separately, 60 mg each day. You can't leave. Let go. What do you mean? You've already pissed off all my friends. And I'm the one who cleans your mess every time. Come on, what do you want from me? How can you just leave my stuff? Don't leave me like this! You know I'm sick, how can you just abandon me like this? - Let go of me. - No! Wu Xiaoliang! You jerk! Jerk! What are you doing? What the hell? Listen to me, there are three things in life you should never touch. Drugs, prostitution and people jumping off buildings! Jump? From this height? I'll probably die faster if I don't jump. You want some? You got enough? First, I lost my job. Then I lost my relationship. And now, even my health has abandoned me. I still haven't told my parents about that son of a bitch ex-boyfriend yet. You're afraid to tell them. Me? I've got no one to tell it to. I don't even remember what my parents looked like. Are you afraid? Afraid of what? Afraid that everyone around us has just started living life, but ours are already coming to an end. You have to believe that each time God presents us with a challenge, he does it for a purpose. If you've never even had a chance to come face to face with death, then you've never really lived. Right? It's not that I'm afraid of dying. It's just, for the past 30 years, I feel like I haven't really done anything meaningful. And if I were to die today, I'd be forgotten, leaving no trace or impact on this world. You're missing the point. Why do you think God planned for us to get sick? He's reminding us that you only have one life to live. Nobody knows when they'll expire. Right? So it's up to us to cherish every day and make the best use of our time, to live the way you want to. Sometimes, taking a leap and being impulsive would make us regret it for maybe a day or two. But being a coward, that's when you'll regret it for the rest of your life. Great. Good point! Here. Cheers! Cheers! I was 28 years old, living the best days of my youth, when my master decided to shave my hair. All right, stop acting. It's time to test just how beautiful you are. How can you still be gorgeous when you're bald? I'd probably look like a nun. No fair. Okay, okay. Stop looking. The more you look, the harder it's gonna be. Just close your eyes. Okay, you can open them now. What did you guys do? Surprise! Come on, let's remember this historic moment! Come on. Picture time! Five hard-boiled eggs! Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! Sir, your dessert. There's more? Here, give it here. I grant to you an oyster. It's an aphrodisiac. Hey, you guys keep eating, I gotta use the bathroom. - Where are you going? - Escape. I gotta go liberate myself too. Here. Forget about them. Let's drink. Bottoms up. Cheers. Xiong's not back yet? No. I saw her asshole ex-boyfriend! What a small world! - Both of them are here? - Yep. Looks like the Avengers are going to assemble tonight. I'm full. Time for the show. Follow me. Go ahead. You handle the girl. Let's dish out our usual. I'm going. - All right. - Trust me. Go ahead. Go ahead. Where are you going? Do you know why I'm here? Why? To tell you the truth, when we were together, he would always bring me here too. Who are you? Who I am is not important. Give me five minutes and I'll make it unforgettable for you. Stop it. Are you sure this is okay? I didn't plan on telling you this, but he said that I wasn't his cup of tea. He says he likes them buff. What are you guys doing? ...and that I couldn't satisfy him. What the... That bitch. Listen. Did you know, when we were together, he wasn't just cheating on me with one person. He'd have three or four. Xia deserves an Oscar. He really likes one of the waiters here. Tall, strong and handsome. I broke up with him because I caught them in the bathroom. Is he in the bathroom again? It's up to you now. Hey. What are you doing? Ladies is this way. Move. Hello, sir. Sorry. Honey... Honey my ass. And the Best Actor goes to Xia! We're a group of crazy women. I don't remember who it was that said true friendships are like health. You'll only appreciate them when you're about to lose them. I can't imagine what I'd be without them. Dun Dun! Sweetheart! - Dun Dun! - Family members, please wait outside. Let's go. Where's Dr. Liang? Heart rate increased. Loss of consciousness. BP is low. It should be the ontological syndrome. Pulse has disappeared. I can't find a heartbeat. Prepare for defibrillation. Two pads at 200 joules. Charged. All right, step back. Prepare a shot of epinephrine. 1 mg. IV. - 1 mg of epinephrine. Ready. Go? - Go. - 240 joules. - Charged. Good. It's all right now. Pulse and BP back to normal. Give her fluids. Check on her every half hour. Let me know immediately if there's a problem. Okay. Dr. Liang. sign here, please. Here's your pen. Dr. Liang... Give me one! Are you all right, Dr. Liang? You didn't feel anything? You didn't even know about the zapping? Do you know how scary it was? The nurse said Dr. Liang's hands were shaking like he was a first-time intern. Did they take off my clothes? Who was it that did it? That means Dr. Liang saw me naked. Honey, what are you thinking? You almost died. I heard that when you were trying to save me, you lost it a little bit. Why are you smiling? Do I have something on my teeth? Your wig is crooked. Is it good now? You don't think it's a hassle? No one minds what you look like here. It keeps me warm. Do you have time now? It probably has fleas. So what? I have tumors. Have you ever had a pet? I don't even have enough time to take care of myself. How would I have time to take care of a pet? When I was three years old, my dad brought a puppy home. I called him Huan. He grew up with me. He walked me to school every day. And when school got out, he'd be right there, waiting for me at the gate. One day, my dad and I brought him out for a walk. We were walking out in front and Huan followed us. We had just crossed an intersection when I heard a screeching sound from a car's breaks. Right when I was about to turn my head, my dad took my head into his arms. He covered my eyes. I never had a chance to see what had happened to Huan. CONFERENCE ROOM 5 I've got a meeting. Here, sanitizer for your hands. Let me give you some hand lotion. No, it's okay. You wash your hands so many times every day. You need to protect them. It's yours. I have more. Well, okay. Thanks. Am I particularly resilient? Like an unbeatable little cockroach? I need to go. After looking in his eyes, I think I can start knitting again! Okay. Go and get the paperwork ready and let me know if anything else happens. Okay. Who were you talking with? Your grandma tripped and fell. Was it bad? Yeah, she broke her leg. She's in the hospital now. You guys should go see her. It's okay. I've got Lao Zheng and Amy here with me. Are you sure? I do feel like we should go back to see her. Because of your grandma's situation and her age. And her heart isn't so well, either. I'm not sure she can handle the surgery. You know, sometimes I feel like I'm just dead weight. Absolutely worthless. Dr. Liang, there you are. Let's go to your office. There's always been a delicate relationship between doctors and their patients. Patients depend on their doctors. Also, when you care for your patients in every aspect, it's often easy to develop feelings. They're just rumors. It's all exaggerated. We shouldn't worry about it. I understand, and I trust your judgment. I just wanted to remind you, that's all. But, on the other hand, it's about time you start thinking about your life. You can't be single forever. That girl Xiong Dun is pretty sweet. If she wasn't sick, maybe there's a chance. You guys seem like you'd suit each other. Please, Director, stop joking around. She's my patient, nothing more. Hello. Okay. I got it! The report for patient in bed 6 is out. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. How many have you eaten already? That's enough. Why didn't you bring some vinegar? Don't be so picky. Just enjoy it. What took you so long? Let me tell you, my mom's dumplings are ridiculously good. Come on. Professor Liang, clinically speaking, when leukocytes are lower then 3.0, or neutrophils are lower then 1.5, what should we do? That's not hard, actually. The majority of patients' leukocytes will return to the normal on the second day. The answers for those questions are in the textbook. I suggest everyone to ask some questions about patients' psychological problems. I have a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patient. Her name is Xiong Dun. I have never treated anyone who was so positive and so upbeat about her situation. During our encounters, I've noticed a few really interesting personality traits. First of all... All right, stop taking it apart. Time to go home. Give it to me. Give it. Congrats, Xiong Dun! Even though your evaluation has cleared you for release, you should take the medicine on time and come back for examinations regularly. Are you here as a friend saying goodbye or as a doctor checking on his patient? Dr. Liang, please sign for the prescription. Okay. Take care. Don't ever come back. And don't come back to visit me, either! Yes, Your Highness. - You must pay attention to these. - Sure. Amy's company is going to send her to Japan for a while. She's leaving tomorrow morning, but she has to work tonight. She said not to wait up for her. Tomorrow morning, she'll go to your room to say goodbye. Let's go to Amy's workplace. What is everybody doing? How many times must you make the same mistakes? You can't go in. If it happens again, you're all fired! Got it? Can you speak Chinese? Yes. A little. Good. You asshole! What? One of your employees, Amy, is my roommate. In the whole year, I have not seen her for at least three months. When she's off work, I'm already asleep. And when I wake up, she's already gone. Forget about a relationship, marriage and kids. She even has to pick what dates she's allowed to get sick. She's moving to Japan tomorrow, and you're still keeping her here tonight for overtime? Does this company have any compassion for human beings? Stop using your Japanese workaholic spirit crap to fool us. We've only got one life. Even if she work her ass off, it shouldn't be for someone as shameful and horrible as you. You don't deserve her! You think you're all better now that you're out? Why did you come here? That little stunt you pulled was fun for you, but what happens to me after this? Why aren't you saying anything? Being better now doesn't mean you're better than everyone! Lao Zheng, let's go. Xiong Dun! If you're mad because I didn't tell you about going to Japan... Stop saying what you think I feel. Okay. Then tell me. I've got nothing to say. I'm a bitch. I shouldn't have interfered with your life. Just how meaningless do you think my life is? I don't need you to run out so you can come and save me! I'm allowed to choose how I live. What's wrong with that? How did you choose? You're someone's mistress. You're nothing but a slave. You think you're the only one that understands love? Seducing your doctor in a hospital, how's that any more noble? If you ask me, I think you're a joke. Amy... Go way! Congrats on your recovery, now get the hell out! All of you, get out! Mom... I want to go home. 29 YEARS OLD WELCOME HOME, XIONG! What the heck? Welcome! The warmest welcome! Welcome! INBOX - XIONG DUN I'D RATHER BE DUMPED TEN TIMES BUT NOT BY YOU ONCE. YOUR LIFE IS MINE, DON'T SCREW IT UP. It's you again. Am I dreaming? Yes. I wanted to say the same thing too. It's you again. You know, if you wanted to see me, you could've just called. You didn't have to come all this way. Are you happy to see me again? No. I knew it. But I'm happy to see you. Let us be like before, like I told you. I'm responsible for treating you, and you're responsible for believing in me, all right? Looks like it's my only option. Stamp. All right. Get some rest. Okay. Have you been here long? No. Does it still hurt? The injections make my nauseous. But after I took the antiemetic pills for the nausea, then I get constipated. If I took the pills for constipation, then my head starts hurting. So, do you think I should take the pills for my headache? That bad, and you're still being silly and telling jokes. I think it's better to die happy than sad right? Can you hand me that? The blue one. - This? - Yep. It's for you. What is it? You're not asking me to knit you a scarf, are you? It's for your future girlfriend. Ask her to knit something for you. If she knows how to, that is. It's okay if she doesn't, just don't throw it away. It was pretty expensive. It's very warm. Then why don't you keep it for yourself? I've been knitting for a long time now, but nothing ever came of it. I don't want to knit anymore. I won't take no for answer! Okay. Thank you. I've always wanted to ask you a question. If... If I was your girlfriend, would you feel embarrassed? Let me put it this way. You are a surprise, one that I'll only see once in my lifetime. Just like an angel sent from the heavens. You have left a seed of happiness in my heart. And now, it's begun to sprout. Am I that powerful? Yes. You must be saying all this because I'm about to die. You aren't me. So you wouldn't understand what you mean to me. Do you still remember the story of Huan? Of course. He was your dog. Yes. I didn't finish the story. I thought he died. Yeah. And after Huan died, I was sad for a really long time. A year later, my dad found another dog for me. In the beginning, I was really happy. But after I had him for a week, I told my dad that I didn't want to keep him anymore. Because when I thought that he'd die one day too, that I'd have to experience the pain all over again, I was scared. But my father told me we shouldn't be scared to live just because we're going to die someday. Death is only a result. How we live is the most important part. To have experienced life, loved, fought through difficulties and overcome ourselves. It's only when we have experienced all these things can we really know what life means. Therefore, we can't give up just because we're afraid of losing. Right? As for me, it's simply too late. Otherwise... You know? What do I know? Stop it. Don't make me say it. I know. This victory is for my friend Xiong Dun. I want to thank her. It it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be standing here today. She's the one who told me we must have dreams. What if they came true one day? Xiong Dun. That's when I realized that I may be great at consoling other people, but a lot of things that I wanted to do have only been thoughts so far. When it comes time to really check things off in my life, I've found out that it's never too late. Standing in front of all my dreams, everything can be excuses. Is this what you want to do? No. This is only the beginning. Go to a rock concert and rock out alongside your ears! Drink a round of shots and scare alcoholics out of their shirts! Host a cosplay party! Hooray for the two-dimensional world! Pet a big reptile and become one courageous Bear. Eat five pounds of sticky rice cakes. Roll, stomach, roll! Cruise on a motorcycle and feel the speed racing through my veins! Meet a Weibo star and experience kindness. WEIBO STAR Learn to play an instrument and play it for a crush. Plant an epiphyllum and wait for it to bloom. Cook a delicious meal for my parents if they aren't delicious. Go on a night fishing trip and absorb the moon's serene energy. Stare up at the Kanas sky, and finding my constellation. Bathe under Mohe's northern lights and feel its magical mysteriousness. Watch the sun rise at the top of the world... and shout... "Go away, Mr. Tumor!" I've always liked touching your lips, ever since I was little. Otherwise I couldn't fall asleep. You were so dependent when you were a child. I have been thinking a lot about your childhood these days. I still feel like you were a kid just yesterday. And a day later, you've already grown up. I remember one time I had a fever and felt miserable. But whenever I laid down next to you, everything would feel better. It was so weird. It still is. Tell me if you don't feel well. Don't keep it to yourself. Okay. Mom... do you know my bank password? I don't want to know. It's your birthday. It's the same for all of my cards. I'm afraid I might forget. Let Lao Zheng deal with the rest. Mom... I know how hard this must be for you. It's pretty tough for me too. Mom, I'm sorry. In the next life, Mom. Let's still be family in the next life. Mom. It won't ever hurt again. XIONG, WE MISS YOU Hi, everyone. Even though I'm standing up here, I will not be hosting this funeral today. According to Xiong Dun's will, she will be hosting her own. Hello, everybody! Isn't it a huge surprise to see me here? Unfortunately, I can't see your expressions. It feels a little strange. For my funeral, I don't want sad music or paper flowers. I want fresh flowers. No tears. Forget it. This is the fifth time already. Because I really don't know how to start. Whenever I think that all of you will see me again at my funeral... It just feels a little spooky. It really makes me wanna laugh. Sorry, everyone. I couldn't make it. But when I think about it, from now on until forever, I'll always be 30 in your hearts. When we finally get to meet in heaven, I will look the youngest! That leaves me quite satisfied. The voice and expression of the deceased... I think I fit that pretty well right now. Thank you, Mom and Dad. Thank you... Lao Zheng, Ai Mi, Xiao Xia and all of my friends who have accompanied me through my final days. I am the only one amongst all of you that's had experience dealing with Mr. Death. So from now on, I have the authority to direct your lives. My train has arrived at its terminal station. But yours have not. You must live happily and spectacularly, and live out the rest of your days. Remember, to love and to be loved are the most important and wonderful things in the world. So, don't ever give up. I've never really left you guys. This is just a different way to continue living, in your hearts. Finally... whenever you encounter difficulties you can't overcome, repeat my name silently three times in your hearts and I will bestow power to you from up above. My name is Xiong Dun. Xiong, like "bear." And Dun, like Newton. BASED ON THE COMICS SERIES "GO AWAY MR. TUMOR" EVENTS, CHARACTERS AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTIONAL I WISH TO SWEEP AWAY YOUR SORROWS WITH MY SMILE LOVE YOU FOREVER, XIONG DUN I was just thinking about which picture I should use for my funeral. Sorry. One more time. RESIGNATION LETTER
