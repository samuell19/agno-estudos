Having a good day? Only joking! OPERATING ROOM No entry You can't come in here. He's my friend. Part of his brain could be permanently damaged. It'll be a miracle if he pulls through. Go and walk around for an hour and come back. Will you be all right? In a year or two you'll be back on your feet. They tell me ten times a day that in a year or two... Fancy a Gauloise? A TALE OF THREE COUPLES The only free table is upstairs. - That's not possible. - Why? Look. Understand? We'll sort something out. You and your wheelchair, what a nuisance! To Olivier! To you, Olivier. It's rather good, surprisingly. It's good. There's better stuff, but expensive! What's the matter, Olivier? Something wrong? I was fine at home. I shouldn't have come. Why? Either you haven't noticed or... What are you on about? - Doesn't it bother you? - What? Everybody's talking about me. I can't stand their staring. Because of your chair? It's a good one, though! It cost an arm and a leg! A huge drain on Social Security! I know what Olivier means. We should have gone somewhere... less busy. As someone who rarely goes out, I like it here. Olivier's just making a fuss. Right! A fuss about nothing, I suppose? What are they all whispering about over there, then? About the good food and wine? No, they're saying how outrageous it is, letting that into a restaurant like this! Eh, Pascale? I'll go and ask them. Jean-Xavier, ask your wife to stay here, please! She does what she wants. Look, you can't stop people... Looking at me like a sideshow freak? - They're all voyeurs! - Don't exaggerate. They're wondering what's wrong with you. Thanks, Estelle. That's nice. I'll go and tell them to have a few bets about it. They could have a sweepstake. With your ears and tail as the prize? Arsehole! - Shall we order? - Yes, let's! - Good idea. - Olivier, you first. You've put someone off their dinner! They're coming this way. Probably to insult you. Or to ask if it's a championship wheelchair. Olivier? Well, I never! - My son Hugo's father. - Hello. Stéphanie. We've heard a lot about you. The same here, of course. Shame we never met before. - Yes, a shame. - Don't overdo it. Are you walking a bit? Well... I recommend the petit salé. Have a nice evening. So? What are we having? Nothing. I couldn't eat a thing. Two years earlier... Still not hungry? Isn't that a bit odd? What's odd? Your operation was 3 days ago. Doesn't it bother you, as a doctor? I'm not a surgeon. I'll ask them about it. Don't go anywhere. Not much chance of that! Hello. Dr Mangin? I'm Stéphanie Ledantec, from France Info. What do you want? I'm doing a report on the attack. Can't people get attacked in peace? - Look, I... - Rémi, she's just doing her job. Come in. Don't be scared. He barks, but we had his teeth pulled ages ago. I'll leave you, then. I'll find some old patient and nick their false teeth! Your attacker's been arrested. He's suspected of murdering a paediatrician. Stabbed, like you. There must be something sexy about us doctors to attract a serial killer. - So... - A problem? No, it's OK, it's working. Just start talking and explain what happened. Don't stop. - Right up to the stabbing? - Yes. Well, I... I was getting ready to leave my surgery, when my assistant announced a patient without an appointment. This chap walked in, looking a bit vacant, and not really answering my questions. Suddenly, he drew a knife. All I remember is the knife, but not being stabbed. And the next morning I woke up in hospital. What's going on? It's France Info. Wonderful! You poor thing. That's all you need! Don't the media have anything juicier at the moment? My wife and son. You can always call me if you need anything else. Claire, can you give her the number? Poor Claire! She didn't even realise you'd fallen for Stéphanie. "Fallen for"? Totally bewitched by her, more like! You even got your wife to give Stéphanie your number. He was on a drip and couldn't get up, remember. - Claire was there. - Devil's advocate! - He's your husband. - Always defending his pal... his "brother". By involving his wife, his subconscious was sharing the guilt between the two of them. You ought to be a shrink on the telly! But a word of advice... Don't give up your day job! Olivier, at that point in his life, didn't want to share anything with his wife. Have you finished talking about me as if I'm not here? Seeing her again has put me in the same state as the first time we met. I've only got half an hour. We're not interested in you now. You survived, everything's fine. All we're interested in is the killer. What can you tell us about him? Who? The killer? I don't know. I... If they send him to the guillotine, that's fine by me. We haven't had the death sentence for a long time. Let him go, then. I couldn't care less. Are you all right? Not really. Because of the operation? No, it's not that. I... I want you to be my wife. What? I want you to be my wife. I don't know how else to put it. You're still in shock. - We barely know each other. - Sit down. Bloody sit down! My whole life depends on my pulling this off. "Pulling this off"? This is ridiculous, I'm going. No, stay! I don't want to lose you. You don't know what it is to lose someone. It happened to me once. I'd rather die. Than lose me? Yes. - Don't they have music? - What do you call this? - Noise! - If it's not Mozart... It's noise! His pupils only listen to techno. I understand your problems with them. What? Dope and techno can't do their brains any good. What about your brains at the foreign office? - Nothing personal, you understand. - No, he's being "witty". I'd better not encourage him. Well, we came here to dance. Coming? It's not exactly my strong point at the moment. Nice one, Pascale! Let's rent a house for the summer. Why? We've got our place in Douarnenez. Exactly. It'd make a change. For the last 15 years Pascale has been bored stiff. What are you on about? Pascale? Of course she's bored. Look at her! She likes to dance, have a laugh... She was a right nutter before she met you. Wasn't she? - It's you! - Did I wake you? No, come in. Jean-Xavier is in his office working on his book. Come on. Hungry? Eat up! My kids loved it. Don't ignore me. - For once I cook something... - Did you hear what I said? Yes, I heard. You said that... Stéphanie is more important to you than your wife. What do you want me to say? Well? - What? - The tart? - Pastry isn't your thing. - You're not being objective. - It's a great tart. - Yes. - Where are you going? - To puke. Stop it... Come on. You want to leave Claire? And you want my blessing? Why me, Olivier? It's important. You're the only one I can talk to. You know what I think? Your Stéphanie has brought you back... What? Back to your real self. Your self-image was damaged. It's a narcissism thing. Yes, Olivier! Yes. At school, you wanted to join Médecins Sans Frontières, discover rare diseases... Yes. That's how I imagined my future. There you go! But that was then, and I was madly in love with you. Médecins Sans Frontières was just to seduce you. Since you wanted to travel... We're not going to go over all that now. Are you afraid to? You needn't be. You have a happy marriage with a man you chose, a boy and a girl that we'd all be proud to have. - You do a job you wanted to do. - Don't keep on, Olivier. Whereas I, the doctor without borders... The only borders I crossed were to move to Paris! You're the one I should have married. - Stop it! - Kiss me! But Pascale likes your house. Did your dad buy it? My grandfather. To get elected. The one you slag off in your book? - "Slag off"? - One of your expressions. You can live in the house of someone you tear to shreds? Anyway, whether it's your grandfather, even a dead one, or your wife, there's always someone dragging you down. What are you on about? I have to tell you something. You've totally fettered me, Claire. You've made a little provincial GP of me. Julien despises me because I'm so insignificant. For the last 20 years I've accepted this cloistered life. Lobotomised... and resigned. I don't understand. I want to be a conqueror again. Stéphanie is there to be conquered! I'm returning to the front line. Julien will be proud of his father. Who's Stéphanie? You want to screw? Come on, then. I'm going now. You're just a spoilt child. You don't understand. Do you think I left my wife and child just for a screw? So you want to get married and have kids? Do you realise what you want? The same again. Like the first was a trial run. But I don't love you enough to accept a... Unless... What could you give me you didn't give her? I've sacrificed everything for you. Where are you crashing? - At Stéphanie's. - I didn't think it'd last a week. Well, you were wrong. I'm deeply in love. I've even got her pregnant. I've finally taken my revenge on my mother, on Claire... - I don't understand you. - What? I wanted this child. With Claire I never wanted anything. I've won. I've won. Won what, you arsehole? But... - There we go! - Carefully now... Tequila and salsa: an explosive cocktail! - You're right. - Eh, Olivier? Yeah, I'm worn out with all that dancing. That music reminded me of Guatemala. Stéphanie, Guatemala... That's enough bad memories. Sorry, Estelle. Anyway, thanks for the Paris-by-night tour. It'll be something to remember when I'm dead. Very funny. Goodnight. See you tomorrow, maybe. How long has he been here now? - Love means not asking. - You're right. I'm off to bed. School tomorrow. See you in a minute. Doing the washing-up now? No, just putting it away. We have to be at the airport in half an hour. - I'm scared. - I've got all the contacts. - I spoke to them. - We can't bring a kid back. We have to try. It's perfectly safe. To Guatemala! We're expected. Estelle, hurry up! What are you playing at? Olivier. Up already? Coffee? I know it bothers you but I'm here to help. You can't wait on me. You have your job. What are you doing with that? I found it in my room. Were you hiding it? Careful! You're so clumsy. - What's so special about it? - It's a real Maya statue. Like a real tourist! Have you forgotten why we came here, to all this shit? I'm a prisoner here like you, waiting for these people... - They'll call! Maybe you're right. You're not bothered about a kid. I think you prefer old lumps of rock to people. - Do you believe what you say? - Never. Will that answer do? It's hurtful, but I forgive you. Wonderful woman! You understand everything. Don't mock. If I didn't understand, I'd have already left you. - I don't think so. I would. Unlike you, I think what I say. What do you think? How many countries do we have to go to before your frustrated paternal instinct is appeased? Look at them! Living in the shit we've created. And we come and take their children! Because your bourgeois wombs no longer produce. That's very clever. "Bourgeois wombs"... Let's stop arguing. We're hurting each other pointlessly. We're tense. I don't know what we're waiting for. These people, appointments, phone calls that never comes... You're tired. So am I. Anyway, we'll have the statue, even if we don't get the child. Does Rémi know it's a fertility goddess? How do you know it's a goddess? - She looks like one. - I hate to disappoint you. She's not a goddess, she's a doll. Kids used to play with her. They were lucky. It's not like your average Barbie. Feasted your eyes? I'm putting her away. Call me if you need me. No smoking in hospital! Be nice. He's been through a hard time. Your letters. And put it out! Open it. It's from Stéphanie. Is she leaving me? I don't think you should take it seriously. It doesn't matter. Stéphanie's history now. Oh, fuck, Rémi! I want to die. Stop it, Olivier! Please! Julien loves you. You can't imagine how much. Hugo will need you, and so do we. I can't take any more. Know what we'll do? It's gloomy here. Why don't you come and live with us? I can't even piss on my own! - We'll manage. - No, no, no! It's already been decided, OK? Estelle suggested doing up the big downstairs room for you. You can do what you like. Estelle can't stand me any more. What are you talking about? It was her suggestion. Olivier? Olivier, what's going on? Have you hurt yourself? What's going on? What is it? I admire you, you know. I admire you. Every morning, you show so much courage. You have to keep at it. Don't give up. It'll be OK. You can't give up. It'll be OK... Calm down, calm down... Nobody's touched you for a long time. Just a sec. Give me your hand. Don't be afraid. Put it on my breast. Go on, touch me. Maybe you prefer it if I come to you. Come here. Don't be afraid. Why are you doing this, Estelle? Why are you doing this? We can look at each other. You're strong enough to do that. Hang on... Touch yourself, Olivier. Go on. Yes? Can I sign some letters? Three of them? Are you sure it won't tire me out? I'm joking, Hélène. I'm joking. They're introduction letters for the mission to Bratislava. Can't Duroy go with them? All these letters... I'll sign them! Then they can manage by themselves. The minister wants to see you at six. Leaving time? Of course. What does he want? Oh, I know! He'll ask me if I'm going to Douarnenez again this summer. - He came to see you last year? - Yes. To pay homage to my grandfather. He was quite sweet. He acted like he was in a museum, caressing the furniture like holy relics. He really worships my grandfather. Like everyone. "When I think... "that in 1968 they wanted his head, "and now here I am, sitting in his chair, in his house! "It took me a long time to understand "how much we owe your grandfather. He was a visionary!" Europe is all thanks to him, Mr Minister. "Mr Minister? Call me Georges here." If he could see you! A perfect impersonation. You think so? I could have been an actor, eh? We're all actors here. My grandfather was the best of all. - No? - You're hard on him. Not hard enough, Hélène. What film is your wife working on? My wife... She got a bit fed up of filming ants. Député Cances, take one. Hello, Monsieur le Député. You are one of the youngest new members of parliament. To what do you attribute... - Stop it, I'm working! - You're watching telly. These are my rushes. Get to bed! Bed! Go on, kids. Right now! - Goodnight, then. - Goodnight. Hello. - The kids in bed? - Yes. Go and kiss them. No, I'll only wake them. How's the filming? It's coming along. What will you do? What? About your book? Why are you asking that? Why tonight? - You've forgotten my birthday. - No! I'm sorry. My mind was on other things. But it's not February! I was just testing you. Go in your office, go on. - When will you finish it? - I don't know. But I have to finish it. Otherwise... I'll go and work. - Jean-Xavier. - Yes? I love you, you know? - Yeah. - Don't I say it often enough? Don't worry about it. Love, Jean-Xavier. Love! Make love to me, Jean-Xavier. Make love to me. Make love to me, Jean-Xavier. ...understand the voters' expectations. And today... How can I put it? We must get closer to people. France expects a turnaround in political action and thought. We must embody this turnaround, and scrap the pointless debates which preoccupy the media. OK? And cut! Were you pleased with that? Thank you, gentlemen. Did you like it? You believe what you're saying? That was my speech to show I care about the voters. Maybe it seems to you that I'm just putting on an act, but I got 56% of the vote in the last elections. It didn't grab you? Look, I'm making a film about the changing political scene, and I wanted to show young, sincere people, who are able to... revive our trust in the system. So you're looking for young men and women who are sincere, awkward and moving, willing to give their all for France? Yes. Smooth talkers aren't necessarily devoid of sincerity, you know. - What if I believed in what I say? - You'd make use of it. Exactly. I tell people what they want to hear because I need them in order to go on. Is that clear? I think you're repulsive. I don't believe you. I have a proposal for you. In 15 years I'll be the president of France. I'd like you to be at my side. Thank you for your trust, Hubert. I knew it the moment I saw you. I know! You're married and have two children. Your husband is my hero's grandson. He's currently vegetating at the foreign office. You're not fit to lick his boots. Think my proposal over. I'm going to bed. Who was that you were watching? Hubert Cances. Member of parliament. Do you know him? Ambitious schemer, so I hear. How do you know? Rumours at the office. He's one of those who want to get ministers "more involved". We're wary of him at the foreign office. But he's definitely on the up. There. Choose the exercise you want to do. Obviously, you'll all go for the easiest looking one! Hard work doesn't motivate you much. What motivates you, Rémi? Not you, that's for sure! Right. Some of you are going to be struggling soon. And remember: time isn't lacking, it's we who don't have enough of it! Till next week. - All right? - Hi. You got mentioned at the meeting. And? Letting your pupils call you Rémi is undermining our authority. The kids aren't stupid. They only do it with me. What do you mean? You're more obsessed by their marks than by the kids. You skip half the syllabus to organise political debates. They're not into politics. Let's raise their consciousness. If you can. I just wonder why you find any pretext not to do your job as a maths teacher. Go on, Rémi, give her one! Hey, you there! Come here! - What did your husband die of? - Testicular cancer. - Shit! - Yes, it was shit. Dying like that, at 35... Yeah, spare me the platitudes! It was tough for him, but for me too. I can't begin to tell you how guilty I felt. Guilty? Why? Are you stupid? Testicles... Oh, right. People gave me an odd look when I told them what he died of. People always believe the worst. It's a shame we're not cars. A car never dies. Do you want to shag her, then? No, I don't want to shag her. She was just telling me her life story. - And what is it? - Stuck as a teacher, like me. Guess what she does in her flat to escape her mundane life. - Belly dancing? - Arsehole! She sculpts. What? You can sculpt in a little flat? - Little sculptures, yes. - There's no point. Maybe. But I thought it was quite moving. - Did you tell her about Estelle? - Yeah, her studio and so on. She really wants to meet my wife. But I think you might quite like her arse. That's nice of you. And what might she like about me? My wheelchair... The real man that you are! You have to get it up! If not in your trousers, then in your head. And you need a woman for that. Hi. Thanks for coming. - You invited me. - It's nice, anyway. This is Olivier, my best friend. Doctor, former top model... He had a bike crash but he'll soon be as right as rain. Thanks. You're a doctor? I was. Now I don't really know what I am. Because of the bike accident? No... More a wiring accident. Well, I'd better find Rémi. I don't know what the hell he's up to. Excuse me. Jean-Xavier has been writing his book for... For... For how long now, Olivier? For ages. In fact, the book is aimed at only one person: his grandfather. Who's long dead. And from up there... - You can't see a thing. - Yet to be proved! - And his wife? - Pascale? She has her own life. Her kids and job make her happy? So she'd have us believe. - She manages? - Yes. She just hopes Jean-Xavier will finish his book. I don't have any friends from when I was 20. It must be great, watching each other grow up... And die! - Marianne wants to see your studio. - Really? - Fancy a coffee? - I wouldn't say no. - I couldn't work among all this. - I like a mess. Sorry. I mean I've really got used to not making a mess. Maybe you should try something else, like knitting! - But I like what you do. - Don't force yourself. I'm not. No, I think it's strong... generous... A bit masculine. I like it. And it pays? Yeah, I do all right. You know why Rémi invited you? So I could see your work. Are you sure? I get you. There's nothing between Rémi and me. He's never tried it on. I'm not worried about that. Rémi's never been a philanderer. But what do you think of Olivier? He overdoes the Quasimodo bit. Why do you ask? Rémi is convinced you and Olivier would make a great couple. A trap! What, Olivier and me? What's Rémi playing Cupid for, anyway? A gorgeous young woman like you can't be short of offers. Whereas Olivier... That's Rémi all over. But Olivier and me... He's clever, he'll get someone. When he's clean shaven and spruced up, he's not bad. - Yes, but there's still his... - His disability? He gets around in his chair. Anyway, it may not be for life. I hope not, for his sake. Will he walk again? He's trying his hardest. Well, tell him he should shave when he's introduced to a potential fiancée. Come here... To stop Rémi cocking up again, you wouldn't know a jolly young woman who could revive Olivier's desire to live? Think it over. Well, boys? What have you decided? - Herb tea or cognac. - Cognac, no doubt about it! I'm sure! Goodnight. I don't know if a child could live here. - There's plenty of space. - Yeah... - It's run-down. - We only moved in recently. We're going to do it up after the holidays. - And the disabled person? - That's temporary. Anyway, he's a friend. He's here... Send me his medical file, since he lives here. Look, I'll write my report and then we'll see. But, well... I fear the answer will be... Of course. Shall I see you out? - Yes, thank you. - Goodbye. Did you hear? Yes. I'm sorry. You should have told me the investigator was coming. The cripple would have gone out! He's an arsehole. What have we ever done to them? Anyone'd think adopting was a crime. I hate these civil servants. I only put up with them for Rémi. He really wants a kid. I can't give up. Look. This summer we'll all be at the seaside... Shag yourselves silly and it might just work. Sea, sex and sun. You think that's the solution? Lots of you are on the roads, but there are no jams just yet, the traffic's flowing... I like this piece. Hey, we've still got work to do! This is no time for listening to music. I fell asleep. Yeah, having a young mistress must tire you out! No, it's not that. I'll put the coffee on. - Where is Stéphanie? - At a friend's. You'll be OK here. It's nice and big. My surgery will be on the other side. It'll be fine. And your holidays? We went to Biarritz. Mum met a bloke. No! Really? What sort of bloke? The sort who jogs every morning. - She jogs now? - No. But she went walking on the beach every morning. - And that's where... - Have you met him? I mean, have you talked to him? Yeah. We all had dinner last night. You've got dandruff, dad. Yes, I know. Your mother lets you smoke? But is she in love with him? No, it's too early. She says she still loves you. She'll get over it. She's a good person. I do hope she'll be happy. I never thought you'd call me. You could have called me. After you said that you were ashamed of our life? I didn't mean that. Forgive me. What's wrong, Olivier? Nothing. I miss you, that's all. The same here. - I love you, Claire. - Stop it! When's the baby due? December. And you? - What about me? - Julien told me. - Do you love this bloke? - Is that why... - Just say you love him. - You're unbelievable! If I didn't still care about you, I'd... Anyway, I know you don't love him. Don't say anything else, Olivier. And stay out of my life. Do I interfere in yours? No! I don't even know what your Stéphanie looks like. Let's just try to be happy. Let's at least have that, in the name of all that's happened. Did you sleep well? You didn't even notice that we'd stopped. I'm sure you were dreaming about another woman. Absolutely not. I don't believe you. But I love you all the same. Shall we? OK? Not too fast for you? Fine. Is it much further? Here we are. Magnificent, eh? Hard to define the style... There isn't any. That's the style! How many other rooms? I don't know. Enough for everyone. Who's coming? - Well, Olivier. - Who with? I don't know. He's been very mysterious. This'll do Olivier. - He can't get up here. - He won't be alone. He's not coming with a prop forward! Who'll help him up here? How do you know? Olivier with a prop forward? I'd like to see that. What's that? I know that car! It's Marianne. How did she find us? It's him! The crafty bastard! What a crafty bastard! - You crafty bastard! - I'm not a crafty bastard. I knew you were interested in Marianne... I was afraid you'd... Afraid I'd what? I love Estelle. I don't see how Marianne... You don't know me. Oh, I do. If I'd told you I liked her, you'd have got too enthusiastic and put the kibosh on it. You're worse than a mother with me. I felt bad after that dinner. I called and, luckily, he was alone. We decided to meet. He showed up in his chair. - And he was different. - How? - He didn't look the same. - Like Quasimodo? He's not bad when he's spruced up. He's even attractive, eh? It's not just that. I haven't told you but I love taking care of the sick. - Where does she get that from? - Her husband. He had testicular cancer. She looked after him. Really? Not very well, obviously, if he died! Olivier doesn't have cancer. Give me your hand. Come on, make an effort! You're almost there. She might get him walking earlier than expected. Or kill him! They piss me off, watching us! - Who? - Them. Especially Rémi. He doesn't act like a friend, he acts like your mother! It's weird, how hysterical he gets about you. He smothers you... In fact, he wants to bugger you! - What are you on about? - He wants to possess you, cannibalise you. Maybe he wants to be you. - I've read stuff about this. - What does that mean? Cut the cod psychology crap. I can tell the difference between cod psychology and the truth. And does your interest in me stem from a guilt complex about your husband? - How dare you? See? It's annoying, isn't it? I can do cod psychology too. There's an art to psychology. If not used wisely, it can blow your head off! OK, I'll keep quiet. - In fact, you love Rémi. - Yes, I do. And I know why. Any mail today? No. Why? Just asking. Had any visitors? Claire. I saw her... and her bloke. What bloke? Her... Her bloke. Pierre. What did you say? Hiding in the car? Right. Right. Shall we walk a bit more or go back? I want to go back. No classes tomorrow morning. I'll see you for breakfast. - Did the lovebirds sleep well? - Hi. Some nice hot croissants, there you go! Isn't life wonderful? Did you get the paper too? Pass it here. I love the small ads. This one's great... "Farmer seeking wife with tractor. "Send photo... of tractor"! I don't believe it! - No more coffee. - I'll make some more. And I'll get to work. You know what this garden needs? A Giacometti. I can see it now. A man walking, standing out against the sky, eh? Yes, but we couldn't afford it. On the other hands, a few garden gnomes would be nice. - What? - You're the great sculptress. - I hope you're joking. - No. I can see a little gnome with a lovely beard... You make the first one. We'll see what the men think. Gnomes indeed! Can you imagine? So, Olivier, how are you feeling? Tip-top, sergeant! Is it that obvious? Shaving every day. It's a long time since I saw you so... Handsome? You can say it. She's given you some of her energy. She's got plenty to spare. And I can plug into the mains for free! Do you still love Claire? No, thanks. Not any more. Marianne hates the smell of tobacco. The stupidest thing is... I don't even know why I left her. - You were bored. It was obvious. - No. No, I have no memory of ever being bored with Claire. What's more, I loved making love to her. I've never heard you say that before. Well? No news. Sit down. It's too early to go back yet. Did you know he still loves you? It's more complicated than that. Did you know, yes or no? He told me. - Yes. - Julien... Any of us could be struck down by an aneurysm. I'm sick of waiting. I'm going to the hospital. If you work every day, you'll make me feel guilty. I'll do it quietly. You'll be fine. I've made him have a nap. It'll do him good. He's sleeping without medication now. It's the country air. He'll be walking before the holiday's over. We'll have to call you Mother Teresa. Making myself useful, for once. Is that for the garden gnomes? - What are you on about? - Just a silly joke. You brought your stuff here for "rainy days", you said. There are no rainy days in her life. Because of you, I suppose? Bighead! - No, that's how he is. - I don't seduce women with pity. Olivier didn't make me pity him. He found the right words, that's all. I think it was his wheelchair... - You're jealous! - I just don't want him making a mistake. - And I'm one? Well, I've proved I'm not. And Olivier isn't your property. Everything related to Olivier is my problem. And always has been. Everything I did wrong before, I want to do right with Olivier. Everything he did wrong with Claire, he tried to do right with Stéphanie. I'm not Stéphanie! Leave her alone. Or you'll ruin our holiday. After all, if it makes him happy... Olivier isn't cut out for happiness. You're wrong. Olivier is finally accepting to be loved for what he is. I hope you're right. And if I am? Is Jean-Xavier coming or not? He's coming... with Pascale. I doubt that. Remember the night Marianne came for dinner? What's he want? What's going on? You should have come. A little dinner party for Olivier. Yeah... A possible girlfriend. Are you on your own? Is something wrong? All right? I should be asking you. What are you doing here, alone, at this hour? I was just out walking and... - Do you want a whisky? - Yes. I think they're closing. A whisky. - Cigarette? - No. And your book? I'm getting nowhere. Does that mean it's finished? No. It's Pascale. She's doing something... that, in a way, destroys my book. What? What is she doing? - She's living. - What? She's living. I don't understand. Forget it. It was good to see you. You can't sod off like that. I come halfway across Paris, and you just do a bunk? Look... It was good to see you, I feel better now. Tell me what's going on or I'll stick to you like glue! - I'm touched that you came. - Hang on... You're not at the foreign office now. Tell me! It's that house there. See? Yes. So? Well... - What am I meant to see? - Hang on. Where are they? Yes! Here, use these. - I can't see anything. - Why? Get on the car. Get up there. Come on! Well? See? - I know him! - Hubert Cances, an MP. - I've never met an MP. - Well, he's one. Where could I have seen him? Yeah, of course! I've seen him in the paper. Paper, telly, radio... They keep a high profile! Not half! She's having dinner. So? She's had dinner there 3 nights in a row! She's just doing her job. It's for her film about politics. She's filming up close, like she did with the ants. That's why she's there. But she hasn't got her camera. She wouldn't keep going if she didn't enjoy it. She's enjoying herself listening to that dickhead! So? - She'll leave me for him. - You're mad! Yes, she'll leave me for that MP. It's history fighting back. That Cances is my grandfather. Everything I hate, everything I'm writing my book against. OK... Let's say she likes him... Or that he amuses her. Is that enough for her to dump her husband and children? No. I think she's just trying to make some new friends. With good reason! Olivier and I aren't always a bundle of laughs. No. Well... Olivier can be a bit of a pain, but you're a laugh. You always make me laugh. Here's your car. It was nice of you to come. Really, thanks a lot. So not much chance of seeing Pascale. A shame. It'd be nice for the kids. Yeah, the kids. You're right. Dad, he said hello. No. He's a wild animal, not a friend. What sort of bear is it? A polar bear. Take a good look. With global warming there won't be many left soon. - When I tell Théo... - You little tease! - Can I go over there? - Yes, sweetheart, go on. Are you working? Trying to. Can I come in? Can I have a word? Hang on, let me make some room. If I had an affair with Cances, how would you feel? You're having an affair with Cances. I don't care. It doesn't hurt? Yes, a lot. But not how you think. Your Cances reminds me of my grandfather. The same sort of pushy careerist. It's like you're sleeping with him. Who? My grandfather. He'd have liked you, in fact. Are you going? We can't discuss anything without your bringing him into it. He's been knocking me down since I was little. This book was to get me on my feet. But you and Cances... I'll never get up again! I can't finish my book. I've knocked you down? I'm the one who's knocked you down? Look at us. How long is it since we touched each other? I thought I was frigid. But when Cances... But when Cances looked at me... with that desire... that desire he has, to... Let me suck you off, my love. - Stop it! - Let me! Cances says I do it divinely. Let me go! I just told you I've sucked another man's dick. Hit me. I'll never hit you, Pascale. You'll never hit me, never raise your voice to me, never... - You're a coward, not a gentleman! - I care about you. Not so loud, I nearly heard that! I care about you. There! I don't want you to leave me. I don't want us to part. There, I've said it. What will you do with that? No, it was a good choice. That zoo is a must. We just wondered where you were. So it's just you and your daughter? Where's Théo? A horse-riding course. I thought he preferred video games. Dad, look at this! I don't suppose I've got a choice! I'd have preferred a bigger bed. It doesn't matter. Mum's not coming. Right. - And Pascale? - You know what a rupture is? What? An aneurysmal rupture. She overheard some people at the zoo. Was Olivier's a serious rupture? Yes. Fairly. What happened? I don't know. He fell. There was haemorrhaging. They'll be operating on him for 5 or 6 hours. The nurse told me to go home. Claire! No, I'm Stéphanie. You've got the wrong person. What are we doing? I can't just stay here. Clear off, then! My mobile number. You don't mind calling me, do you? No. After his stabbing: Stéphanie. After his aneurysmal rupture: Marianne. What else does he have in store? Words, words, words! Get a move on! Cough it up! All right, dude? The terrible child on vacation to Royan with his new partner - What are you doing? - Going home. Something wrong? I'm hot. What's got into him? Hello. Can I see Mr Cances? Mr and Mrs Cances have gone out to dinner. Mrs Cances... - Can I take a message? - No, I... I'll call. They're not back yet? No, I'll call later. I loved Film Club at school. Kids never get to see those films. - Like Le Mépris. - Godard's greatest. But the discussions afterwards... - Can I tell the story? - Yeah, it's a free country. They sat through two hours of film without batting an eyelid... Some were asleep, of course! All the same, Rémi, with his usual enthusiasm, suggested a discussion at the end, and asked questions about the beginning. Do you remember the scene with Piccoli and Bardot? She's naked and she goes... "What do you think of my bum?" That's right. Rémi asks the students if they felt the poetry of the dialogue. But the kids are exhausted by a film without fight scenes. The poetry inherent in "What do you think of my legs?" or "What do you think of my bum?" goes right over their heads. One little sod goes, "Talking about someone's arse isn't poetry!" And Rémi, still serious, says that poetry... What did you say? "Poetry is everywhere. Just try and you shall see!" And then, this other little sod goes, "Yeah? So what do you think of my dick, then?" And that was it. Sheer mayhem! They were all swearing, claiming it was poetry. We couldn't calm them down and Rémi lost his rag. - He screamed at them. - I can imagine. In the end, one of them goes, "And that poof in the hat..." By "poof" he meant Piccoli... "And that poof in the hat... "Can't he see that the bird in the buff wants shagging?" - What did you other teachers do? - Showing great solidarity, they buggered off, leaving me with a horde of raging kids! Your poor thing! We were cowards, but we couldn't stop laughing. That's education today. Teachers unwilling to face the reality of society. Was I right to rejoin this world of maniacs? It's time for invalids to go to sleep. - May I? It's good for muscle tone, pushing his hotrod. The teachers will clear up. To work! What do you think of my dick? Leave it out. - What do you think of my fanny? - No! And what do you think of your wife? - Switch it on, I'm not asleep. - I woke you up, sorry. I'm coming straight to bed. What are you doing? Looking at you. You've got a tan. You're beautiful. I'm no Bardot. You're tanned too. - Muscly. - You think so? - No! - You're really brown. Not tonight. You have to be fit for tomorrow. I've had a bet with Rémi. I bet it's something stupid. You'll see. Now go to sleep. Not sleeping? No. I have to tell you something. He just got in, I'm telling you. How do I know? I just do. Put him on. Well, Cances? Is that you? Jean-Xavier, Pascale's husband. Does that ring a bell? I want to talk. Now, right away! You've nothing to say to me? Tough! You'll just have to listen. On the pier facing the hotel. I'm waiting. Now, right away. Good. In a minute. Thanks. I read, in a very serious book, that Freud and his best friend... Fliess. Fliess, that's it. That they both loved the same woman. And their homosexual relationship began through her. - Yeah. - You knew? Yeah, I'd heard it. What are you getting at? That Rémi, in love with me, but unable to have me, brought me to you. So I could have you in his stead? Is that how you see yourself? As a token of love that Rémi offered me as a sacrifice. But subconsciously. Sublimating your latent homosexuality. Rémi's a bit over the top with you, isn't he? Rémi's "over the top", as you say, with everyone. He's very giving. Outgoing. And he's full of love and goodwill for mankind as a whole. I've made the most of it for 20 years. Shamelessly. OK. But if, one day, your pal full of love wanted to... What would you do? I'd ask your permission first. - Plonker! - Plonkess! - Imbecile. - I trust you. But... they're not going to bed! He daren't tell her I'm waiting. What a coward! What a coward! The bastard! The fucker! You're not asleep? Did dad tell you when he'd be back? No. Just that he'd be back sometime tonight. I can't sleep. Can I sit here a bit? Come on. Are you comfy? Have you put her to bed? She went straight off. What's that face mean? When I tucked her in, she hugged me, and, half asleep, in that little voice she said, "'Night, mummy." It felt weird. It would have felt weirder if she'd said, "'Night, daddy." You're as stupid as your pupils. Can't I joke any more? What is it? You're crying. - Look... - It's nothing, I'll be OK. She's a lovely kid. Just like Pascale. Have you noticed she never mentions her mother? Maybe it's just as well we never had one. Why? - What if we got divorced? - We'll never get divorced. And kids are tougher than you think. I'm not so sure. Look at us. We did all right, didn't we? Not like that, sir! - What? - Give it here. Fill it up. Tell me the truth, I'll be strong Go ahead Will things be better tomorrow? A woman leaves you It makes you completely crazy Everything's wrong and it's the end I can take it all even if it's hard Go ahead Will it stop one day? Will we get back to square one? Before the amnesia? Before we'd forgotten what love was? The aching heart The sense of despair The lovesick feeling that clings like a leech Finding yourself flat on your back That's the blues That's the blues That's the blues Crying a river, as they say That's the blues... I bet loads on this! Five metres, she bet! Let's go! - Go on! - You want to do it? Go on! Go on! - Get up out of this! - Yeah! - Great! - I'm going to do it! Go on, five steps. One... Yeah! Two... Never two without three! Listen, ladies and gentlemen! Never two without three! No! Wait, wait... I can make it. Three... four... Oh, shit! - There! - Five! Did you see, dad? What have you been up to? Where have you been? - Look at your face. - What about it? - Haven't you slept? - Slept? I'm starving! Starving! Thank you. Goodbye. - It was a pleasure to meet you. - Same here. I'll be back, for sure. Don't forget... You're my bedrock! See you soon. Let's go. Goodbye. Subtitles:ECLAIR
