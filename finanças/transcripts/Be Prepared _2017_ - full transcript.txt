We are taking pictures! Group photo! Hop! Hop! Hop! One-two, one-two! The younger ones go ahead. Norbertick, are you a junior? Not simular! - Be ready! - Always ready! Scout Camp 2016, let's go! -One two three four five - One two three four... - Will you have some bread? - No, old man. Have you seen your mother. Failures at the distribution of certificates? The best advertisement for sobriety. Really, Failure? Okay, we were joking! Jacek! - Drinking alcohol from behind. - To the left! - What? - Turn around. - Oh, you ... - What? - No spine. - How funny. - Let's go ... - Bad luck, I was joking. - Sit down ... - Guys, do you know who is sitting there? - Where? - Ahead. - Need to share with them? - No, but we agreed on something, right? - Okay, Jacek, good. - Give it back. - Come on. - You should set an example for the younger ones. - We serve. Thank you. BE READY Very funny. Come on, come on! Switched off. - Does the link also concern? - Link too. Thank you. Have you given everything? I'll return it at the end of the shift. Oh, damn it. Crazy? Where is my picket? - Petrek. - Norbert. Finished singing! Camp to attention! Get ready, Comrade Commander! Transport carrier Jacek Veselovsky reports ... ... the camp is ready and ready to start the summer scout shift 2016. At ease! That year we invited young people from Ukraine to our camp ... ... this year we will also accept children who could not go on vacation. And I'm sure that ... ... Petrek, Antek, Lukash, Wojtek and Romek ... ... become good scouts. - We don't use telephones here. - Why? Because there are more interesting things to do. - These are our rules. - I have others. Do you remember that before your arrival you agreed to receive ours? - Telephone. - And I do not have. Good. - Are you whole? - Turn away. Don't look! Lord, calm down! "Do not utter my name in vain", does this mean anything to you? That's how kids ... Yes, Jacek, these are children. But my program is designed for elementary school students. So what? Can't handle these? Send them back? Of course I can handle it, Comrade Commander. Well, don't punch my brains. This is not a parking lot. What? This is not a parking lot. And not a gas station, right? Norbert? You missed the meeting. - He helped me change the wheel. - It's true? No. Thanks for the ride. Has the ambulance station been set up yet? We must put up a tent. These silvery things are called "matches". Here you go. You insert "matches" into your pockets. There are 12 of them in total. And these long green ... ... are called "masts". Tie pegs to the ropes. Drive the pegs into the ground so that the ropes are taut, this is very important, remember. Turn off! Relax, he's chronicling the camp. Let's go and try. We have the most beautiful tent, what do you say, Tomus? Young, help him! Listen, Tomek, go get them there a little. Go bring me on, please. “Don't tell me what to do. - Please, a chair ... - A chair has already been brought. Jacek, Jacek, you are a womanizer! Will it survive? Guys ... I don’t know. Bad luck. Sit down and check. One two Three! - Give it back! - You are nuts? Give it back! Let him go! Are you out of your mind? Dont touch me! - Get an extra outfit in the kitchen. - Fuck you! Make us! Try it! Who will help the guys put up the tent? Tomek, choose someone. Norbertic. You. You will figure it out. Petrek, let's step back for a minute. Listen ... one word of mine ... ... and your pocket money will be frozen. Three hundred a month? - Take them for yourself. - Wait. And if they refuse to travel home? To pitch a tent, you need a mast ... ... "matches", pegs ... -... and ropes. Where is it all? - Here. - Where? - Here. - Where? - In the ass! Okay guys ... Have you already chosen your link name? From the nursery to the coffin, one city - one club! "Legia"! - The theme of the camp is connected with the Warsaw uprising. - Exactly. - Fight and dedication. - The fans did not participate in the uprising. Fuck. “We would fight these days. “Maybe yes, maybe not. Choose a title from here. Pull harder here, but loosen up here. Now tie the beams with a triangular knot. You only know how to tie a loop? - What you think you are? - Hey! What are you doing, huh? Sorry, I wanted to chop off the mote. Everything is fine? Comrade, we have ... What do we have? We have an accident. - With whom? - With Petrek. In which place? Show it. Nonsense. He will heal before the wedding. And when is she with us? Make me an offer first. - That's right, friend. - Comrade. Girlfriend? Cargo? - Friendship? - Pull on your pants and let's go. Who is it? Andrzej "Morro". He was 21 when he died during the uprising. - Hero. - Marek. Women were crazy about him because he was handsome. They called him "Cupid". It was derived from the pseudonym Andrzej Morro. Do you know who this is? Do you know who this is? - Oh no. - I give a hint. "Before you fall, you crossed the earth with your hand." "The bullet overtook you so, did your heart break?" - Kapets, hint. - Bachinsky. - This is Bachinsky. Great Polish poet. - Franek! What it is? Our patron. German? As if the Germans hadn't fought during the uprising. Change. Give me a book. “You said yourself to choose from here. - Change the name! You break the rules that you set yourself. The rules do not change during the game. That's it. Only Hans Frank did not participate in the uprising, as he was at that time in Krakow! We'll have to change the name. Can't you shine in your face? I'm out of gas. Well, don't push it, I just need a couple of liters. Why are you silent? Have you ever talked to a woman? Yes? How many times? - Does mom count? - Well ... Mom is mom. Then you are the first. Thank you. Can I help you? Hold on. You're a criminal now. We'll merge it a bit, we'll return it tomorrow. Camp! Form two lines facing me! Thin, you will be paired with Kshishek. Gonza with Lukas. And Antek with Andrzej. And you, Petrek, will be paired with Tomek. - What? - What hear. Does he even know what a compass is? Now he knows. Attention! Disperse to the starting point! Pick up the pace. - Do you hear? - I go, I go, shut up. Shut up - you're going to tell your mother. - That? - Nietzsche. Found north? I was lucky that Jacek gave you a pair, otherwise b ... -... I missed the compass. - On, choke. Electrolov. - Hide, moron, get out of here! - Wait a minute! Dad, how many amperes are there? Oh, for 40. - How much do you need to fry them? - Them? One. Do you know that this is illegal? I'll notify the police. What? - Will you kill us? - Shut up! - This cretin is delusional. - Son, bring the hooks. Do you hear? Run! Well, freaks? Nobody will believe this little thing anyway. How do you recognize us without eyes? Stum? "Little Red Riding Hood was walking in the woods ..." Did your father hang out in Stum? Ten. You answer with your head so that this junk keeps your mouth shut. Time! Two! Three! Run! Kapets! - Like in the movies! - Like in the movies, damn it? - Have you finished? - I'll knock on them. Do you want our death, fraer? We were by a hair's breadth from her. I also found a savior. What is your dad? Did he steal coal or tore goats? Laugh now, apricot! Laugh! Is it funny to you, you little bitch? Is it funny? Fuck off, woodpecker! Calm down. What would you do if you were me? - I would have kicked out of the camp. - Why? “Because he's a stupid son of a bitch. - Shut up. So... He brutally beat the scout. You're right. What do we do with the scout? Who brutally beat a friend. So, comrade transport ... ... what would you do if you were me? What's happening? Are you defending him because you yourself are poor? Fuck you all! - Tomek! - I didn't give a damn about this camp! Where is your efficiency? Contagion ... how do I look? As usual. No ice. - Yes? What are you doing there? - Mushrooms. - This rooster is kapets. - Yes, I agree. Get crazy. These ditches are usually neck-deep in shit. We were going for gasoline. Okay, I count to ten. One ... two ... ...three... ...four... ...nine ten! You missed 5,6,7 and so on. You see, we hardly teach mathematics in medical school. Probably not only her. Listen, you better put on your pants. Maybe you will follow the road and not smoke? I wonder how you will react. For what? That you will have to undress in front of me. I am not planning. And yet? I assure you that you will be lying naked in the dispensary today. “Then you're in luck. - True? - Because I'm handsome. - Dream. What time will you see? It depends ... ... how quickly you want to get rid of the tick that I noticed on your bottom. The point is clear. From the guy with alcohol a mile away. I stumbled, fell, broke my head and you're done. What are you talking about? Tomek never drank. And this time he got drunk. You dirty the crime scene. Good guy. I'm just saying that Tomek couldn't have been drunk. What do you think happened here? Jacek ... it's not your fault. I would like to quietly search the tents. Can we keep what happened a secret? - How long? - Until the autopsy results come. - They will start asking. - Who? All. What to answer if asked where Tomek is? Gone AWOL. But I have never deceived them. Sometimes it is necessary. For their own good. Unrealistic. - What? - Everyone will know everything anyway. Yes. But the later the better. Better for them. Just say you want to cover the commander's ass. Tell me. I want to protect the camp. Form two lines on the parade ground! Run! On the parade ground! Two lines! Two by two! We are building! Antek, we're building! We wake up! Run! Put on your shirt and run! One, two, three, four, five! Attention! At ease! Guys, faster! Voytek, Romek, faster, let's build! Thin! Thin! What was it? What was it? Attention! At ease! The camp is dirty. In toilets, tents, in the kitchen, there is dirt everywhere. I see dirt everywhere. Now the whole camp goes to the outpatient clinic for sanitary control. Attention! Disperse! - Jacek! - Norbert, everyone! Do you understand? - But can I ... - Do you understand the word "everything"? Then go. Did you know Tomek well? Did he have enemies? Has anyone wished him harm? Everyone was willing. He had a difficult character. When was the last time you saw him? Last night. - And you were not surprised by his disappearance? - No. He left things, documents. Doesn't this seem strange to you? It's in his spirit. He often ran away, but then always came back. Do you think Tomek could ... No, this is definitely not suicide. - Where such confidence? - Because I know him. It only seems so to you. - Not ice. - Yes? - What are you doing there? - Mushrooms. - This rooster is kapets. - Yes, I agree. - Okay, let's go swimming now. - Are you crazy or what? You don't know how to swim. “This is not your fucking business. - Relax. Fuck you! Come out. Come out! Listen... Marek and Antek have lice. Bring them to me for disinfection and we'll finish, okay? Following. What it is? - Oh, yo. - Someone forgot the rules? - Give it back. - No, why do you need it? The carrier robbed me. Thief! Antek, Marek - to the isolation ward. Stand up! The rest of the Nazis are in the kitchen. March! Petrek left the camp at night. - So what? - They drank vodka. Yes, they drink, they steal. Does that surprise you a lot? They came here to learn something different. And it seems to me that we will not teach them anything. They don't obey our rules and don't even try to do it. Because you cannot convince them to submit. - Where the fuck are you going? - To Tomek's parents. If you want, you can go instead of me. You are temporarily responsible for everything. I will try to get back as soon as possible. - Did you eat today? - No. And you? Were you well fed in the center? Delicious on Tuesdays. Did you live in the same room? I mean, you're with Petrek. - And two more. - Does he hit you? - Who? - Petrek. What are you! How long did you sit yesterday? - Not for long. - Did you drink vodka? We don't drink. I found vodka bottles in your tent. - Can not be. - Did Petrek drink? - Petrek does not drink. - Then where did you get them from? I do not know. It was tonight. - I do not remember. - Look. - Look at the screen. - I tell you I don't remember. Antek, what are you afraid of? I'll protect you, just tell me what you did tonight. Do you have lice too? - Help yourself. - Thank you. I won't give it to you. You are generally superfluous here. I heard stars drink pissing to improve their complexion. Infection! Let go! Let go! What the fuck do you want again? We were going to go for gasoline. I am busy. - Then I'll go. - No. I'll go, but then. - Okay, I will wait. - Stop! Infection! Is there a rabies vaccine? Get up, come on! Ssy! - Come on! We will be sure that you will not surrender us! - Come on! Okay. Imagine the biggest asshole in the camp. Introduced? Now imagine that this asshole is on his knees in front of you with his mouth open, and you sip into it. Let him go. Thank you. Didn't see him yesterday? Not. Take a closer look. Did you come last night? - Who is asking? - I'm asking. No, I didn't come. It looks like I saw him after all. - What is it? - Check. Pierced at night. I wasn't there yesterday. Maybe you can call the one who was on the night shift? Sleeps after shift. Have you seen this? Take a closer look. Not. Don't boil. This is the first time I see him. - Wait a minute! - What? - Would you like a coffee and a pie for the promotion? - You go! In your mouth or pussy? Have you seen him? Did you see him or not? Maybe you saw him? When? Have you seen this? And when? Can not be. When exactly did you see him? Thank you. Tuk-tuk. - Who's there? - Scouts. I do not believe. Open it, you cheat, they don’t lie! Damn, Norbert! I'm sorry. - Your plate is full. - I'm not hungry. - Not hungry? - Not. Sit down and eat! Sit down! - Eat. - They no longer fit. Do you want to help them? This applies to everyone. Please eat! Please eat! Until you eat, do not leave the table. Eat! - Glory to Jesus Christ. - Forever and ever. Come on in. - Are these graves? - Tombs of the rebels. Young people need examples. But these are all tragic images! Each of them could live a wonderful, useful life. Yes. “But they donated their lives to the country. - Not donated, but donated. There is a difference. Please move the altar somewhere else. - May our Lord always be with you. - And with your spirit. Greet each other with peace and love. Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those who are called to the supper of the Lamb. Lord, I am not worthy for You to enter under my roof, but just say the word, and my soul will be healed. - The Body of Christ. - Amen. Priest, sorry ... ... that guy in a tracksuit with a short haircut ... - Petrek. - Yes, Petrek, and what happened to him? I'm worried about him. I cannot understand him. He is a good guy. You just have to be patient. And he did not tell you that ... I really want to understand him. Do you know about the secret of confession? Would you forgive the murderer's sin? The road to forgiveness is open to everyone. Whoever takes someone else's life does not deserve to live. Fortunately, you are not the one to decide. With God. Anxiety! Let's get up! Climb! Let's get up guys! Anxiety! Narchik! Bartek! Alive! Norbert! Let's get up! We put on uniforms! Guys! Anxiety! Three minutes! Three minutes! We collect things! Gonjo! Climb! Thin! Thin! Wake up! Collect your backpacks! Alive! What are you looking at? Put on your uniform! Pack your things! At the pace! Alive! Two minutes! One minute left! Two lines! Fast! You can't even get together normally! Do it! Run after me! March! Left! Left! Left! Left! Let's run! Let's run! Norbert! Norbert! In action! What the hell is this? Dictionary. I'm looking for a new word every day. What was it today? Fraer? Do you know that earlier a man caring for a woman was called a fraer? A kukan is a string on which a caught fish is put on. - Norbert! - Kukan, get up! Go see, dude! Antek! Anyone have a lot of fun? Sit down! - One. - Louder! - Two. - From scratch. Countdown from scratch! Zero. - One. - Louder! - Two. - Louder! - Three. Four. - Louder! Five. - I can't take it anymore. - Could you yell? Could yell? Get up! Let's continue! - Two. - Louder! Norbert, I can't hear you! Louder! Seven... Eva! Eva! Wake up! Hush. Take it. This is glucose, will give you strength. Only real men eat candy. Why are you standing here? Sorry, Norbert. - Dont touch me! - Dude, calm down! “You have nothing to be ashamed of. - Dont touch me. Can you use it? An idiot. And now... ... maybe someone from Hans Frank? Come on. Good. I will go. Get in. Fear of heights? - What are you doing? “You don’t need her. You can trust us. Can we trust you? Fuck it, got it? You will answer a few questions. Whoever decides that you are telling the truth will have to hold the tarp to catch you. And whoever decides that you are lying will return to his place. Have you ever stolen? No. - Maybe once it was. - So you're a thief, right? - No, I'll get you in now. - You're a thief? Yes, damn it, I'm a thief, happy? He told the truth. Have you had sex with a prostitute? Yes ... but free. - Did you kill? - What, epta? Killed? Yes. John Lennon. And I was the one who shot the Pope! It's true? It's true? - Are you crazy? - Why do not you answer? - Who are you to judge me? - Stretch, okay? Well, what are you waiting for? Stretch. Still have questions? I will tell everyone about Tomeka. It's not normal that they don't know. - You can't. - Why? Do you want to play prosecutor? I want to know the truth. Take a look. Filmed that night. “It doesn't prove anything. - Of course. What an amazing coincidence of circumstances. - Why didn't you give the tape to the police? - This is too little for them. He must confess. The one he likes. He trusts you. And tell the truth. - You're crazy. - If I'm wrong, nothing will happen. So what? Then you let go of the situation, right? Then I'll let go. One, two ... Something like that. Ready for the Olympics? Not quite yet. Why haven't you escaped from here yet? Compared to my usual life, this is a vacation. I am very glad that Tomek escaped from the camp, I could not stand him. So do I. Once he entered my tent with a bare bump ... ... and offered two hundred square meters for a suction, count? So what? Nothing. I wanted him to die. Voice over - you get. Confessed! Everything is recorded! - Skin. - Run away! Fire me! Wait. Brother was swept away. This rooster has laid us down! You should have been watching him! One extra word - and I will find you! My rebel! Nothing. Nothing wrong. This means nothing. Do you know from experience? Fuck you. Thank you. Heavy night? Sit down, I'm going to you. Let go. Hey. Did you know her? I will finish you! - Stop! - I want to show something to Pan Inspector. - Then! - Calmed down? - I have something for you. - Similarly. Do you recognize? Yesterday was on me. Found in the victim's hand. - I do not understand. - I also. You will go with us to the police station, there, maybe we will find understanding. The resistance can be very spectacular. You should watch this. One slut claims to be hitchhiking and didn't see you for sure ... ... and the second - that she just came and knows nothing. Can't you say anything? "It's not me". Or ... "I loved her." I already told you who did it. The problem is that Peter has an ironclad alibi. What can not be said about you. "She was excited, she said she should wash up immediately." How many people saw you run out of the ambulance at night? Witnesses saw Eve crying as she washed in the lake. Have you watched the recording? - A beautiful couple. - He then confessed to the murder of Tomek. So he killed her. I can not hear anything. But I also found this. - Did you like it? - I didn't shoot it. I like you. Rape is not murder. Did you find your cell phone? In a case with the Legia logo. There is a record of the guys drinking the night Tomek was killed. - We didn't find any phone! - Well I said that he was in my jacket! Swipe between the gum and lip. - What for? - Let's see if you left your DNA on it. I can't breathe! Why is there a grid? 4096... ... multiply by two ... ... will be 8192. Multiply by two ... ... will be 16384. Multiply by two ... ... will be thirty ... Get dressed! So what? Finally, they are all together. No wonder. After two corpses. Come back home, Jacek. I did nothing, they let me go. They let go because there was no evidence. And Eve died from an electric shock. - You do not trust me. - What's the difference now? - You destroyed the camp. - I destroyed the camp? - The lads are afraid. - Do you know what they are afraid of? - The gang that you brought. - They are afraid of you, Jacek. Leave the camp immediately. I have your backpack. Parents came for Jurek. Count it up, I say hello to them ... ... and they: sorry for Tomek. Of course, I tell them, he did a stupid thing to run away. And they told me: ran away? He's been fucking dead for days! And you knew everything! The police say he fell off a cliff drunk. - What does it matter? - Have you ever seen Tomek drink? That very night the punks drank three bottles of vodka. They all leave tomorrow. And we will never know the truth. Can't you find a smoke? Keep it! Why did you kill them? Are you fucked up or what? Are you funny? For help! He pushed Tomek off the cliff. And drowned Eve. But why? Because he's a monster. Ask him. “He doesn't look like a killer. “Ask him why he killed. Come on ask! Infection! Let go! Lord! Where did you get them from? Who! Eva gave. When? I know you loved her, but she was just a common whore. What did you do? Generator plus cable ... and boat. That's how poachers do it, didn't you know? And I'm sorry for the cross, I was angry with you. Very angry. - Why? - Because you are weak, Jacek. Didn't react to Tomeka. And he mocked us. From the inside he was breaking up our camp. How? How did you do it? Pushed him into the cliff. I took vodka from the gopniks. And poured it into his mouth. And that's all. You will rot in prison, Norbert. And for what specific reason? Everything I've told you is just a hypothesis. It could have happened, but it didn't. Do you know that you and I are very similar? If something gets in your head, turn off the light. But don't worry, I won't tell anyone what happened tonight. It's not your fault, Jacek! It is not your fault. If you leave, who will be waiting with me? What to expect? Maybe it will come up?
