Subtitle created by - Aorion - "Minions 2015" ^ (Run time : 01:30:51) minions Minions Minions have been on this planet far longer than we have. They go by many names. Dave, Carl, Paul, Mike. Oh, that one is Norbert. He's an idiot. They're all different. But they all share the same goal. To serve the most despicable master they could find. BOSS! - Boss. - Boss. Making their master happy was the tribe's very reason for existence. But that's not to say that they didn’t have other passions. - Hey, look. It's a banana. - Move over. Hey, I know. It's a banana. Ha-hah-ha. Yum yum. Huh? Finding a Boss was easy. But keeping a Boss... therein lies the rub. Ow. Ow. Owww. Whoa! Oh. - Oop. - Aw. - Oh. - Oh. I am... oaf. Aw. Nope, it wasn't easy for these guys. But they never gave up. With the emergence of the stone age came the rise of a new species. Man was very different from the dinosaur. He was shorter, hairier and way, way smarter. The minions took an instant liking to Man and helped him as best they could. Oh, no no... Here. A present. - This? - Yes yes yes. For hitting. Ut-ut. Aw! Poor man. So trusting, so fragile, so-so delicious. Their quest for a boss put the minions front and center for some of the civilization most historic moments. Ancient Egypt held great promise. Okay! But it didn't last long. Hmm. Oh. Here. Yup. Ow! The dark ages were actually fun times. Their new master had a tendency to party all night and sleep all day. Ahem. Yoo-hoo. [Happy Birthday] 357 Oh. But eventually the party was over. Achoo. They bounced from one evil master to another. But they never seemed to find their perfect fit. One particular employer took their failure very very badly. Huh? The Minions had no other choice but to keep moving. Oh. Look. And then, when all hopes seem lost. They found sanctuary. The Minions were safe. Years passed as the Minions forged their own civilization. They truly made a life for themselves. But something just wasn't right. They felt empty inside. Without a master, they had no purpose. They became aimless and depressed. If this continue any longer, the Minions would perish. But all was not lost, for one Minion had a plan. His name was Kevin. He was excited to share his idea with the tribe. He'd been preparing for days, weeks, months. But now he was ready. Buddies. Kevin would leave the cave, go back to the outside world and he would not return until he had found his tribe the biggest baddest villain deserved. But he needed help. Me! Me! I will come. Bob was eager to go. - Kevin? But Kevin felt he was just not strong enough for the dangerous journey ahead. Uh no. One other Minion? Me. Choose me. Me! Choose me! Aw. Me! I will come. Luckily someone stepped up. - Huh? - Stuart! Come here. Huh. Me? Me? Oh, thank you. Truth be told. Stuart had no idea what he was chose for. Huh! Wh-Why? But was thrilled that made people cheered for him. Uh. Stuart, Stuart. One more? ME! I am strong. See here. See! - Oh. - Oh. Uh... okay. One more. Kevin. Choose me. Please. Choose me, Kevin. Come here. Huh. Yeah! Ha ha. Eventually, Bob's energy and enthusiasm but mostly lack of other volunteers changed Kevin's mind. - Kumbaya! - Kumbaya! Kumbaya. Big boss! Big boss! The tribe said their farewells. Kevin had given them something they haven't had in a long time. - Hope. - Kevin! - Bob! - (Big boss! Big boss!) Hey,Tony. Good luck to you. Tom. Take care. And Chris. See you later. - Hey Bob, you coming? - Yes, yes. Big boss! Big boss! Bye bye. Kevin felt pride. He was going to be the one to save his tribe. Stuart felt, hungry mostly. He was going to be the one to eat this banana. - And Bob - Oh. Bob was frightened of the journey ahead. Okay. Okay. Look for the big boss. Ah. There you go, Bob. Come on. And they were off. Off, to find their new boss. Come on, Bob. Huh? Kevin? Oh. - Hungry? - Food? There is no food. Huh. Banana. Uh. Stuart, What it it? Banana. - Banana! - Aww. - Stuart. - Food. Stop! Bob! Stop! Huh. Oh. Land! Bob. New York 1968 - Oh, look at that one. - Whoa! Whoa. Look at that one. - Peace! - Make love, not war! Peace to the world. Boo ya. Boo ya. Boo Ya! Boo ya, boo ya. [Music Pad] Banana.

This is going to be so fun! And the bedtime story. Oh, yes, I've got a really really good bedtime borey. Once upon a time, there were 3 little pigs. One fateful day, the pigs encountered a big bad wolf, who had a wonderful surprise for them, The wolf offered the 3 piggies and all their friends a job working for her. Everyone would be so happy. All the 3 little piggies had to do was just steal one little crown. That the beautiful wolf had wanted ever since she was a penniless little street cub. Unloved and abandoned. But that crown would mean she was a princess. And everybody loves the princess. So, the wolf sent the piggies to get that crown. But the little piggies weren't up to the challenge. They failed their mission. So the wolf huffed and puffed and she blew them off the face of the earth! The end. Good luck getting the crown tomorrow, little piggies. I know you won't disappoint me.

Clearing the way for Scarlet Overkill to be crowned Queen of England, She will be coronated at London's historic Westminster Abbey. If I'm wasn't so polite, I say this spells certain doom for the country, if not, the world. But, I'm so very polite, that I shall keep my mouth shut. But, seriously, we are all in big trouble. - Scarlet - Ms. Overkill. I don't have time to answer any questions. I'm just want to thank the minions for going above and beyond the call of duty.

So get comfortable, Minions. Get real real comfortable. Because this is where you're going to spend the rest of your worthless little lives. Alright, let's do this. Look. Look, it's Herb. Who's this handsome Herb fellow? No, My name is Blerb. I'm a-a dungeon master. Prepared for torture which I do. Alright, are we comfy? Doesn't matter. This is TORTURE! - Oh. - Uh, anything? No no.

Ha ha ha. Buddies! Hey, Kevin! Eww. Ah. Kevin! Kevin! Enough! This... ends... now...! KEVIN !!! Ha-ha-ha, you imbecile. Have fun exploding. Take me home... - What's the rush? - Got to get out of here! Let... us... go! Whoaaa! No, no no no... Ke-Ke-Ke KEVIN! Here. Your Puchi. Huh. Puchi! You're alright. Look! - Kevin! - Kevin! - Oh. - Ooh. Yoo hoo hoo. Ouch. - Stuart. - Hm. - Bob. - Yes? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen. We are here today to celebrate the Minions. The country owes you a great debt of gratitude. Bob, you were a wise and noble king for all of 8 hours. So for you, I offer this tiny crown for your Teddy Bear, Tim. Oh. Thank you. Thank you. Oh. Very good, Bob. Oh! Oh, spectacular! I'm so proud of you boys. - Oh, Stuart. - Ah. What's up. For you, I have this beautiful, super duper incredible snow globe. Snow globe? And, look. Look. Hours of excitement. Oh... Yippee. Thank you. Oh, Stuart. We're just messing with you. Don't be mad at me. It was Kevin’s idea. - Ha. - Kevin! We have a much better surprise for you. Here. A Super Mega Ukulele. Wo-Wow. Cool. Thank you. Right. Uh. And finally, Kevin. Yes, my queen. You are hero of the highest order. For your bravery and valor, I am knighting you. From here on out, you are Sir Kevin. Well done. What a beautiful moment. - Kumbaya! - Kumbaya! The nation and the world was celebrating Kevin, Stuart, and Bob. The last few thousand years were rough, no question, but things were finally going their way. Kevin had never been more proud. But something was missing. Ha ha, yes. Good show Good show. My crown is gone. It's gone! Blimey! - She lost the crown. - Oh my god. Ha-ha-ha... Scarlet? They took everything from me. My castle. My reputation. Things looked bleak, baby, I'm not going to lie. But now, at least, I have my crown! Fellow, give me that back. No, I don't think so. You have no idea who you are messing with. I'm the greatest supervillain of all time. Oh, were you? Bud-Bud-Buddies. Come here. Come here. Lo-Lo-Look! It's the boss. The boss! Come on! Are you really going to allow that little penguin to make off with my crown? Oh, Herb. I'm done. Here. For Me? Oh. Yes, for you. Bye bye. Big boss! And that is how the Minions found their new boss. He was cunning. He was evil. He was perfect. He was despicable.
