Maise, I'm here. Raymond? We waited as long as we could. Lawrence, let's let your daddy sleep. Oh, how are the things? The coroner arranged for transport, can meet us up there. I'm taking her. Okay, alright, well, we'll meet ya up there. How's the mountain air, buddy? I always talked about bringing you up here, but Mama didn't think it was worth shit. They own the defense, offense, everything, it's unbelievable... I'll give you time. What a play to the left. Daddy? It's alright, buddy, it's just Pastor Hirsch. Marty. Raymond. Good to see you, Raymond. Glad I caught ya. Hello, there. How ya doin', buddy? Daddy? Hey, stop it. I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, no it's just gonna take him some time. I don't want you to worry about anything. She's in good hands, Raymond. We got her the plots that are right next to your parents. I know you're going through a troubled time right now, but I want you to know that I'm here. So is the Lord. If you ever wanna talk to me, my door's always open. It's a drive, bringing here back here, Raymond. Hey, look, that's enough. Just sit still. Thanks, Marty. Yeah, sure. I gotta get going. Okay. Ew, gross, Mommy. Hey, Lawrence, come on. Look at me. With people like that, they're gonna spend their whole lives trying to be original. You, you're lucky enough to be born one. Just get yourself some chips. Just don't look at him, baby girl. Mommy! Oh, my God. Where are we? This is Nana and Papa's house. It's where I grew up. Ray. Hey. Oh. I'm so sorry. I don't understand, what the fuck happened? Truck just came out of nowhere. Just the middle of the day. A regular day. I got me the first flight back. Oh, my God. Officer Marrow. Hey. Hi, Lawrence. That's right, I'm Officer Marrow. This is your Aunt Caroline. Say hi. You're nice. Nice to finally meet you. Ooh, he's precocious. I just... I don't know what the fuck I'm doin'. You know what, you're here. Why don't we just start simple, and go grab some take-out from Coney, and we'll teach him how to play rummy. How does that sound? Okay. Well, I'll come by first thing in the morning. You're here now, right? You better get used to seeing my face. Are you gonna stay here or with Amanda and Burg? No, we're gonna stay here. Alright. Okay. Alright, then. Alright. It's time to go to sleep now. Are we gonna put Mommy in the ground? That's enough now, Lawrence. Time to go to sleep. You're tired. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. Now I'm gonna be sleeping right here next to you. Go to sleep. Have I ever let you down? If we do this, you gotta deliver, 'cause if you don't, Denver's gonna wipe us off the map. Hello, Shelly. Two well and a cup. Mm-hmm. Fuck Colorado. We make one call, first truck's on the road in five minutes. Don't make me the bad guy, Bernie. And that's a yes? Yeah. Who's your friend? Oh, we met on social media. Can I help you with something, Bernie? I heard Ray's back in town. That's right. And I heard Maise Connely met her maker in the form of an F-150. I figured somebody who knows how hard it is to lose somebody would be a little bit more empathetic. You don't talk about her. How you doin', bud? Lawrence? I look pretty, Daddy. Jesus Christ, what are you doing? You don't do that. Here. Why am I a boy this time, Daddy? Because your mom and I asked for you, bud. I don't wanna yell at you. I'm here, okay? Do you here me, bud? Let's get you dressed. Is Mama gonna be at the party? Yeah. ♪ Summer without the candlelight ♪ ♪ To blush up your baby and gone ♪ ♪ And I ain't got no sugar baby now ♪ ♪ No, I ain't got no sugar baby now ♪ ♪ Giving up every cent I made ♪ And I wander in the shade ♪ And I ain't got no sugar baby now ♪ ♪ No, I ain't got no sugar baby now ♪ ♪ Done all I can do ♪ To make peace with you ♪ I sung it to you on the next payday ♪ ♪ Oh, I sung it to you on the next payday ♪ ♪ And it's you, I cry you, honey ♪ ♪ And it's you who'll sing this song ♪ ♪ And it's who I can cradle when I'm gone ♪ ♪ Ooh, it's who I can cradle when I'm gone ♪ When the dust returns into the ground from which it came, and the spirit returns to God. Maise was a daughter of this community and a wife and a mother. And we all remember Daddy? What we love about Maise, and take that love with us everyday. Dad? We should all remember to keep what we love about Maise close to our hearts. Daddy? And in that way, Look, that's enough. Her spirit lives I'm sorry. Through us. What are doing? No. No, Daddy, no. Stop it, I don't even know what you, you're out of line. Come here. No, no, no. No, Daddy. Stop it. No, Daddy, stop it. Stop. Lawrence, just shut the, stop. No. Stop moving, stop it. Get away from me. Hey, that's enough. Yeah, we're fine, thanks. Stop. Get up. That Maise has gone to a better place. And the Lord welcomes her. And she is also here with us. You can't expect him to be all sunshine. I can barely hold him down. You know, pediatrics over in Sunbury, they have some... Let me go talk to 'em. He's not seeing a fuckin' shrink. All's I'm saying is that if he needs help... Ray, what do you want us to do here? I don't fuckin' know. Well, let's see how he's doing when he wakes up. Just one more thing for the people to talk about in this town. I just thought he'd have a chance at something normal. But I guess it don't matter. 'Cause this shit is just as random as an IED on a 10 year old. Don't bring that Eckhart Tolle shit back here after everything you saw over there. You don't get to tell me it doesn't matter. It does matter. You matter. Lawrence matters. And I'm sorry about what happened to Maise, and I'm sorry that you had to come back here with your family but you need us. And we need you, Lawrence needs you. So you can cry and you can be sad, but you damn well better be strong. She's still with you. She's with you in him. Everyday. There now. That's good. You're gonna be just fine. Are you then one makin' all that racket at the service, huh? Lawrence, this is... Nana. Norma, this is Norma Coleman, Lawrence. July's Nana. What? Lawrence? July Rain's Nana. You son of a bitch. Norma? Now just hold on. What's goin' on? Tell your father what you just said, Lawrence. It's okay, buddy. What did you say? July Rain. Ah, here, I'll take him. Come on, bud. What? Have you been talking to him about anything? I told you that he's been saying shit since we got up here. It's not normal, I know it. You know, Maybe Maise was telling you things that were goin' on up here while you were deployed? Maise fucking hated it up here. That's the whole reason we left. July Rain Coleman is Bernie Coleman's daughter. Remember you and Maise left town when she was a toddler? Ah, yeah, okay. Well, maybe she was at the funeral? Mm, that's not possible. July's case is a cold case. She's been missing. She was 15. No one would dare talk about it. Lawrence saying it to Norma, it's beyond rude, it's downright dangerous. Well, somebody said somethin'. Look, you know how things are here. Answers don't always have to be true as long as they're believable. So you talk to him or you don't talk to him, but you gotta come up with somethin'. Alright now, stop playing with your food, buddy. Do you wanna talk to me about what you said to Miss Coleman? Did your mama maybe say some things to you about up here while I was gone? About July Rain? July Rain? Yeah, that's right, July Rain. Little girl from around here. Do you remember talking about her to Miss Coleman? Did somebody say her name to you? Maybe somebody said it at the house? Alright Lawrence, look, it's really important, okay? You really hurt some people's feelings when you said that, and these aren't the type of people that we wanna be hurtin'. I really need you to try and remember where you heard it. I didn't hear it, Daddy. Lawrence... Alright, you're done. I'm not done. Yeah, you are. Look, I don't know who taught you to lie, but you don't do that shit with me. Get this. C'mon. So, where's your boy, Ray Marrow? Bernie. Figured you'd have been gone by now? Yeah, you're good right there. My condolences about Maise. I appreciate that. Some people might say you bad luck. But I guess that reaper, he follows all of us, don't he? Norma says your boy's quite a talker. Yep. You know how kids can be. Yes, I do. At least I did. Spit it out, Bernie. When my baby girl first went missing, whole town was bells and whistles out lookin' for her for weeks. For weeks. You know, these people up here, they, they got their faith until they don't. They went from scouring the end's of the Earth to just droppin' it. And no one even dared so much as mention her name again after that. Until today. Well, somebody did. And that's where he heard it. He didn't say nothin' else? Look, Bernie, I am sorry about your daughter, but we're talking about a little boy here. Yeah. Well, you have a safe trip back to the city. Do you like it here? I remember it. You remember what? Playing in the woods. Yeah, you mean earlier? I used to play in the woods. I think you're tired, bud. Let's get you outta here. I pulled up into the parking lot at Coney's the other night, it was a beautiful night, twilight. Sun had just set. And saw this remarkable vision. Really, you could see everybody's face inside at the booths, and they all looked like they were perfectly at peace, and strangely they were lit from underneath. Stop what you're doing right now. It was like a beatific vision. So I walked up the steps and I walked inside and saw everybody was on their cellphone. Everybody was connected to what? We live in such a difficult time to, it's, I call it the disease of separateness. Which is why it's so wonderful that we're here today, and every Sunday to bear witness together, to have fellowship in Jesus' name. And what we fight on a daily basis, what we struggle is the separateness because when you separate, you are alone, and when you are alone, you are removing yourself from your fellow man. Your brothers, your sisters. And it's easy to fall. Sunbury. That's right. Hey, listen, bud. Do you remember what you said during Mama's party? Easy buddy. St. Luther's. How did you know the name of that church, Lawrence? I was there. And when was this, Lawrence? At July's communion. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six... When were you with July, Lawrence? Before. Before when, bud? Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, again. Hey. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Ask him something. Lawrence, hey, honey. You like it up here, huh? Do you see that lady over there behind the counter? What do you think her name is? Shelly. Everybody knows Shelly. He knew St. Luther's. He said that he was there for July's communion. So what are you thinking here, you think he's clairvoyant? Maybe the accident did something? Lawrence, look at me, buddy. How many fingers do you think I have behind my back? Three, Daddy. Lawrence, maybe you can talk to me about July Rain? Do you remember what she looks like? Is her hair, is her hair like my hair? No. What if we showed him a picture? I don't know. Well, you called me down here, Ray. What do you want from me? Look, I don't know what this is. I got her file at the precinct. If you wanna know if maybe he just heard something about her at the service or if there's something else going on. Let's just stop guessing here. Ooh, yeah. I picked her up for stealing from the Wawa over on Norton Street. She was 15 years old. About six months before she'd gone missing. Wanna play a game, Lawrence? You see all these girls? You think you know which one is July Rain? You sure, Lawrence? Jesus Christ. Did your Grandma show you this photo before? Look at me. Did Mommy show you this photo? No, Daddy. Don't lie to me. Ray, let's take a break. I don't know if this is related to the accident, but I know the idea of someone trying to get into Lawrence's head isn't what you want, but he's gonna need to talk to somebody. We got this woman out of Harrisburg. She's come out for child trauma cases before. A real nice lady, a little bit liberal with some of her techniques, but to tell you the truth, if I get on the phone with someone from Sunbury or Lewisburg, I doubt they'd even come over here. So... You knew what Maise would have done. He's still your son, Ray. What's goin' on? To tell you the truth, I don't know. My nephew is showing signs of trauma. Hard to explain right now, Chief. What's that got to do with the Coleman case? Not sure. That's why I figured I'd leave you be until I got something more concrete. The Coleman case is cold. Yeah, I know, Chief. Alright, well, get out of there. Come on, now. And put your goddamn belt back on. ♪ He said, I want you back ♪ She said, you can't have that ♪ ♪ He said, I want you back ♪ She said, she's never coming home ♪ ♪ Never coming home to you ♪ Never coming home to you ♪ Never coming home to you ♪ Your love is a hurricane ♪ Come on up and set me right ♪ And you got me going under ♪ With a heart racing like thunder ♪ And so my job, really, at this point, is just to merely hope that some part of the gospel gets through your brains and your phones to your hearts. And for that, I will be truly grateful. See you next week. God bless. Raymond, welcome. Marty. Sit. The Dark Knight has arrived, Raymond, and he calls himself the internet. You know, oftentimes it's when there are no answers that we struggle with our faith the most. I'm not a very religious man, Marty. We're all born with faith, Raymond. Even you. Before your parents were called on. You may not remember but I do. Well, I'm not here for me, Marty. I'm here for my son. Do you think that a man's demons can be passed down to his son? We've all done things, Raymond. I don't think that's true, Marty. I think that some men have done things so that others don't have to. Have you ever seen anybody die, Marty? Right there in front of you? I've done things, and I think that I've cursed my son because of it. Phew. Would you let me pray for you? Yeah. Heavenly Father, hear our prayer. Guide us to peace. Ray, this is Sherry. Hi, Ray. I understand that you just lost your wife. My deepest condolences. Death can be quite confusing for the living. This the little child of light you two made together? Yeah. Hmm. Hey, what's your name? I'm Doctor Sherry. This is Lawrence. Hey, Lawrence, how are you doing today? Good. Hmm, just doing some light reading? So, Caroline, on the phone you said that he's been saying some pretty wild things? Ever since we road up here to bury my wife. He's known the names of people and places. He's never been up here before. Hmm, and the girl that you mentioned... July Rain Coleman. Huh, well, that's a name, isn't it? Okay, well, why don't I sit down with him, see if I can figure out what's going on. I don't know how long this is gonna take, but you're welcome to wait right outside. That woman makes me more nervous than a crack head with a shotgun. How are Burg and Amanda holdin' up? Best they can. You know, Burg served in the Gulf. I ain't sayin' he's much for conversation, but he knows what it's like out there. Everybody's got their limits, Ray. Talkin' to someone might serve you well. You have yourself a beautiful boy there, Raymond. What are we lookin' at? Well, first you have to understand that when a child is involved in a tragic accident, they may suffer from what some might call post-traumatic stress disorder. Right, you may know something about that being in the military. So what? You think the accident did this? I think the accident may have woken something. And what are we talkin' about here? Come. Lawrence, look what I have. Now, Lawrence. I wanna talk about July Rain again, okay? Like we just did. Your daddy wants to know what we talked about, okay? It's okay, bud. So, where did you hear the name July Rain? Yeah, in your head? Mm. And did you know her? When did you know her? Before. Before when, buddy? Before me. Huh, I mean, I have never encountered this before, but I've heard stories about it many times. In some cultures, children born with distinctive birthmarks like Lawrence's, they are watched very carefully as they develop. They believe that these children have a special gift. That they can remember information from before they were born. What are we talkin' about? Are we talkin' about psychic ability? Ah... She thinks he's having memories from a past life. I was stationed in the Middle East. There are a number of religious groups there that I think you're referring to, Doctor. They believe in reincarnation. Sherry here thinks that Lawrence is remembering July because... He was July. Okay, what are you two effing with me or something? No, it's not a joke, Caroline. And Ray, I'm happy that you're familiar with some of these practices, but these events have been documented throughout the world. They're not specific to one place. I hate to break it to you, but this isn't some kind of spiritual awakening. God knows you'd have a bestseller on the shelves in a month. But you're reachin' here. And this, this ain't helpin' my son. Ray? Ray? I'm sorry, Carol, but Jesus Christ. Give us a scotch. Two. Thanks. There's plenty of empty tables you'd be more comfortable at. What is it that you do, exactly, Dr. Sheryln Bomont? And what business is it of yours? Well, ordinarily I just make it my business. But see you with this kind of landed right in the middle of my wheelhouse, you know what I mean? I treat people. Yes, that much I know. Of more interest to me is what you talked to Ray Marrow's boy about? Now, while I'd love to breach the doctor, patient code of ethics for you and your band of degenerates over there, I think I'll refrain For the sake of my career. I don't always get to practice non-violence. I always ask myself is that because I'm a violent person, or because of the bullshit I get from people? You see, I've been lied to all my life, Doctor. And even when my baby girl went missing, there was no person in this town who had a goddamn word to say about it. All I'm askin' is for a little truth. Is that too much to ask, Doctor? One, two. No. Better not get hurt on that thing. You know, I never blamed you when you left. I was proud that Mom was proud of you, even to the end. She knew. I was fightin', it was in our cards. You in the war and me in the force. I knew that you'd be alright once you joined up. Yeah. I don't know why things always happen for us the way they do, Ray. God knows I wish that we had it different but we don't. And for whatever reason, hell, this could give us a little glimpse. I mean, what if this is true? I think we deserve it. I think we deserve a little glimpse into the other side. And I think as much of shitty person as Bernie Coleman is, I think he deserves it, too. Lawrence, get over here. You lied to me, Raymond. Bernie, listen to me. There's a lot of unanswered questions right now, but I want you to think first. You gotta... I gotta what? This bitch telling me my daughter's inside of him? He knows what happened to her. Put the guns down. Fucking kill everybody here. I wanna talk to him. Put the guns down, and I'll let you come over here and talk to him. Put 'em down. Baby girl? July? He ain't your daughter, Bernie. Are you in there, baby girl? How does this work, how... That's not July, Bernie. Look at him. What is he possessed or somethin'? Lawrence, this is Bernie Coleman. It's July's daddy. Are you in there, baby girl? Bernie? What, what's happening? Talk to me. Is she gone? What happened to you? I gotta know, please? July, I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you. Alright, look, I need you to let go of him now. You're not takin' my baby girl. Ray. You do it, you think I give a shit? You let him go, and I swear to you, I will stay in town until we get to the bottom of this. But if you don't, I will put a bullet in you, and you're never gonna get any of your answers. God. Hey, you okay? She sounded iffy on the phone. Bernie probably scared her straight back to Harrisburg. Good morning. Good morning, Dr. Bomont. Hello, Lawrence. Ray. I am so sorry about Bernie. Oh, No. I should apologize. He just didn't leave me much of an option. Ray, I wanna thank you for choosing to do this. I think that you'll find that this helps you as much as it helps Lawrence, here. How do we do this? We just walk inside the memory. Remember that old board game? Maybe you played it when you were a child? If Lawrence sees something, a street or a shop or a building that he can match to some image he has in his head, and he can build those images into a pattern. Into thoughts, and hopefully, into memories. Come on, buddy. We're gonna play a game, okay? Winner gets his very own stack of pancakes. Okay. Parzano's. Anthony's. Krug's. It was hers. It was July's. Did I do good, Daddy? Did I earn the pancakes? Yeah, bud. You won. You did really good. Chief, I don't expect you to understand. Shut up. Look, I realize in the whole scheme of things, your family has been dealt a hard hand with death. Be honest, that's why I thought you'd be good at this job. It's best to know death is gonna be knockin' on your door at every traffic stop. But your brother comin' back here with his troubled kid startin'... That's my nephew. I said, shut up. Did you ever think for one minute how this would effect this town? That's the trouble with America today. No one lets a dead dog lie. A man lost his daughter. And you want me to ask him to relive that 'cause some kid is playing hide and go seek? You've known me longer than my own daddy, Gordon. In that time, I feel like I've tried to be an asset to this department, and I've kept the oath that I swore to, but this, this is... Here's what's gonna happen. I'm gonna forget we ever had this conversation. Your brother's gonna pack his van up and go back to the big city, and you are gonna return to being a model officer in this community. Now if you don't mind, Shelly's chili dogs are calling my name. So have a good day. Thanks, Warren. Thanks, ladies. Ray? Do us both a favor and get your son back to Philadelphia, will ya? You get him some help. Leave the people of this town alone. I don't like this anymore than you do, but something is going on here, Sheriff. If you ain't gonna fix it, then you should sue me Because I'm not going... Lawrence? Lawrence? He did it, Daddy. It was him. He hurt July. What are you doing? You don't do that. No, daddy, no. Just, shut up. Praise to Christ. It's okay. He hurt, July. Until next Sunday. Goddamn it. He hurt July. Lawrence, stop. Get over to the Coleman ranch. You better hope Norma doesn't flap her gums to Bernie. What'd you think was gonna happen with your little stunt here, huh? I swear to God, anything happens to my brother, I'm holding you responsible. I'll come with you. Ain't no goddamn way you got a warrant that fast, Caroline. I didn't see you there, Norma. Just wanna word with your boy. I heard your nephew. We all heard him. Boy's got the devil in him. Well, it's hard to say. It's a bit confusing right now, isn't it? It would really help if I could speak with Bernie. Is he inside? I told him the boy must have caught some demon in the car when his mama died. Pastor Hirsch, a killer? You know, I've always been fair with you and your family, Norma. Even through the investigation, I treated that case like July was one of my own, didn't I? Bernie, come on out. I always liked you, Caroline. Your mama was a good friend of mine. But what your brother spawned, Bernie's coming for answers. And with the Lord on his side, he'll right the wrongs done to this family. You can believe that. I swear to God, Norma, I ain't askin' this time. Don't fuck with me. Chief, Chief, come in. I'm on my way to his house in South Harrisburg. Put off on... Goddammit. Has she contacted you? He's gonna want answers, Marty. Jesus Christ. It's the word of a five year old. Now you know how people around here are. If a raccoon came out of the woods and started talking about Bernie Coleman's daughter, then animal control would be cleaning up raccoons for the next year and a half. After all this time. Only thing you gotta do is just keep your mouth shut on this right now. Let me deal with the Coleman's and the Marrow boy. But listen, if we come down to it, if we get to a breaking point, I want you to think about offering up what you know. Oh, they ain't gonna believe I just put her on a bus. Huh, well, I'll take being a lousy lawman and you being a son of a bitch over lettin' 'em hang you for this. We're talkin' 'bout the goddamn Coleman's here, Marty. Now I want you to come back to the precinct with me. The only way I know you'll be safe. I go hiding at the precinct, I may as well put a guilty sign on my chest. Now you have to trust me on this one. Caroline, come in. Chief? Chief, I'm pulling up now. Looks like some kind of barn. I'm on my way. Can you get to the precinct? I wouldn't ask if I had somebody else. Best case scenario, we bring Bernie in, and you get to listen to one of Marty's sermons. Do me a favor, just stay here. You let me deal with Bernie Coleman. Come on, bud. Let's get you sorted. Grandma's got your favorite pancakes in the car all ready for ya. I need you to talk to him. Find out what you can. Well, come on, if you're coming. Shit, shit. Chief, there's no one here, we gotta get back. Pastor. You have a gun? You alone? Now open the goddamn door. So, I wanna talk about where you've seen the pastor before, Lawrence. In the woods. In what woods, Lawrence? I've served this community for 30 years. I know you have. And I know that you're not a violent man, Marty. Bernie Coleman is not the type to listen to reason. Do you believe your boy? I don't know what I believe anymore. Pastor? I need you to get someplace safe and hide. Now. You don't wanna do this. This is not gonna end well if you make me come in there, Raymond. Let him go. He's good where he is. Goddamn it, Bernie. I want 'em in the same room, and I wanna hear him say it. You ask him right here. Not like this. I said I want the truth. I ain't gonna get it here. Put the gun down. You know, Gordy's gonna be pullin' up any second now. You think his brother's gonna give me a fair say? You're on the clock here, Raymond. Enough. If I take you to him, they stay here. I just want answers. This is it, Bernie. No guns. Including yours. We take my van. Jesus, please don't do this. Oh, God. Please don't do this. Ray? Please. Are you sure you don't wanna play, baby? Daddy. Oh, he'll be back for ya soon, bud. Amanda? I want you to get him in the back. Lawrence. Ray? Ray, this has gone way too far. He's unarmed. Raymond? It's okay. Daddy? What y'all are doing, this isn't right. Look, look here, baby girl, July. Come, come, come, come a little closer. He's not possessed, you half-wit. Shut up! This is insane. That's enough. How do we do this? I wanna hear it fro, fro, from him, and I wanna, I wanna hear what he saw. Please, be quiet. Lawrence, do you recognize this man? What did you do? Ray, please? Lawrence, look at me. Did he hurt July? This is a child's imagination. You shut your fucking mouth. It's alright, bud. What is it? He hit her. You think for one moment that this man's gonna let me live? That you're willing to carry that? Lawrence, did he kill July? You motherfucker! No! Bernie! Bernie, don't. No, Bernie. No! Okay. Ray? Ray? Ray? Ray? Lawrence? Lawrence? Lawrence? ♪ I'm never coming home to you ♪ Never coming home to you ♪ Never coming home to you ♪ Coming home to you ♪ Never coming home You ain't gonna touch her, Ray. It's okay, Bernie. Ray, don't take another goddamn step. It's not your fault. Ray. She loved you. Lawrence? Lawrence? Hey, hey. Are you okay, bud? Down there, Daddy. Down there. Not here. I need to see your hands, Pastor. Now. Do you trust the words of a child? For they are the keepers of the divine light. Marty? Jesus Christ. Stand down, Caroline. She had no business being in this town. I told her. She was better. She should see the world. Marty, don't say another word. I loved her. Marty, listen, Marty. I loved her. The ambulance is on the way, Marty. I loved her. I tried. I put her on that bus, Gordy. Mart... Shut the fuck up, Marty. Caroline, holster your weapon. You knew. Deputy Marrow, put your gun down. He did the right thing by puttin' her on that bus and gettin' her the hell out of this town. Jesus Christ, Gordon. But she showed up in the middle of the night. Are you kidding? She convinced the bus driver to drop her off. It was pouring rain. Marty... I'm sorry, Gordy. She was gonna tell her father. She just wouldn't listen. Don't... Gordy, I tried.
