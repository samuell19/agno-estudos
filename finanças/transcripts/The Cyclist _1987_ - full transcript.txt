Your wife is a disease collection. Take her to a well-equipped hospital. She can be cured only at this address. Do you have any money on you? No. lt's a dead person's blood pressure! We have to run a bunch of tests to make a diagnosis lf she dies before then, it's not my fault. Sign here. You have no other choice. Sign it. THE CYCLlST A thousand a night for the room. l gave you a discount, so it comes to 500. Three hundred for the service and oxygen. The tests, operation and doctors fees will be charged on a separate sheet. You have to pay a night in advance. How much are you going to put down now? This is Afghan money, my friend. Here, take it back. This is for tonight. We'll tend her for now until you get the money. l'm going to exchange the money and get Ayas' address. l'll see you tonight. l suppose you need to be given a chance. Do you have the guts? He's a daredevil, but he's not into illegal things. Nobody is. One is not born a criminal. But later on they can develop a taste for it. Then their path is set. Can you drive trucks or be a co-driver? He's a bicyclist. He won a prize once, riding for a few days. He gave me shelter when l was smuggled past the border. Well, l don't know much about these things. What are you going to do? Are you going with him? Don't worry. l'll take care of Jomeh. l'll go change the oil. You'll stay with us tonight, won't you? You work like a dog, but to no avail. l shouldn't tell you this, but your wife is gonna die in this poverty... unless you strike gold at the bottom of a well. l'm going back to well-digging. l want to go with Ayas. l'm going to leave him in your care. Ayas is gone. He came to see you half an hour ago. Police! Police! He hasn't found a good job yet. He's a recent immigrant, a foreigner. You've got two days to make it happen. lf you do, you do. Otherwise, it's not my fault. He dug six meters yesterday. lt's rocky ground, and they won't pay more than 50 a meter to the Afghans. Let's go. We'll think of something by tonight. Drop in on that Bozkeshy festival today. Everyone looking for laborers goes there. Come on. Pull forward. Stop! Stop! Stop! Someone's under the bus! He's trying to commit suicide. Why are you sleeping under the bus? What's wrong with you? Here, take this. Get out of here. Find yourself a safer occupation. l need two well-diggers and two workmen at 50 a day. Two well-diggers for 50. Wait a minute. Where do you think you're going? l'm not gonna dig an oil well! l only need two workers! Get down! Aren't you coming down? Since you're not coming down, l'll take two workmen at 30. l don't need more than two. Come on, come on. Pull forward. Wait! Someone's under the bus! Come on, come on. Get up! Pull him up! You say you need a lot of money, and you need it fast. Grab the horse. Grab the horse. Here. Take it for a walk. Work up a nice sweat. l have to think. We're having another cycling race in six months. You can enter it. He's in a hurry. His wife is dying. Let's see. ls this man really a champion Afghan cyclist? He once rode three days around the clock. With these kinds of people, l could start a circus again. Are you ready to start a one-man circus? Never mind. Turn around. l've got an idea. l'm starting to like him. How many days and nights can he stay on a bike? The poor guy is desperate. He'll do anything you say. l need... l need to consult with someone. Come back tonight and l'll have an answer for you. How many days... How many days can you ride anyhow? How many days? Three days? How about five days? Can you do it for a week? Are you mute? What am l gonna say? Bravo! Bravo, number 10! Push that gas pedal all the way down. Number 15, what the hell are you doing? Get moving! l've got to talk to you privately. Again you're coming to see me at the wrong time. But this will make you happy. Or l can tell the others and make them happy. What's your proposal? l've found a real desperate guy. He was made to bet on. He's a former champion. Bravo, number 10. Bravo, number 10. Push the gas pedal all the way down. Are you sure he's for real? Yes, he's the real thing. He was a long-distance cycling champion. He's got a three-day record. His wife is dying. He's willing to circle even for a week. How are you going to manage it so that nobody finds out l have a hand in it? - How do l know... - l've never gotten you in trouble, have l? Have you been waiting a long time? What a profit l made in that business. This is the warehouse where l keep all my stuff. Where did l put it? This is the glorious silk lndian ticket. l made a lot of money off this. There was a time when l was a man of importance. Now l'm just an ordinary man. There's a bike. Go get it. A change of tires and an oil job will put it back in shape. Hey, kid, be careful with the bike! Stop wrestling with it! The glorious lndian circus. This Afghan does wonders. His name is Nasim, or Breeze, but he resembles a typhoon. He rides the bicycle blindfolded. This man right here... Don't mess around there. Get back. He stopped a train in lndia with the fierceness of his gaze. ln Pakistan he lifted a couple of bulls with one finger. Get up. Go back to work. And this time, he's going to ride and live on a bicycle for seven days around the clock. Get with it, mister. You're going to miss it. The ticket is half price the first day. My dear lady... Oh, you don't want a ticket. These people, they can't even applaud. Give me that hammer. ls this the place where someone's gonna commit suicide? Hey, wait a minute. You've got to pay double for peddling. The best circus in the Middle East! The Afghan hero has been on this bicycle blindfolded since this morning. Don't judge him on his looks. He's defeated Russian champions. He's got to relieve himself now. He should drink less tea and liquids. Don't hold it toward yourself, man. Don't stare at him. He's shy. Nutcrackers! Flints! Fans and coal-blowers. Come on, folks. Get your kebob-sticks. Fortune-telling! Palm-reading! Your ticket, ma'am. Ticket. l bet two million he couldn't. l bet on my feelings, but we'll settle it later. You call in a referee. l'll pay your rent as well. Go sit down. Call for an ambulance. l'll get the governor's permission. l've brought you here to learn a lesson in life. ln life you'll reach a point where you'll have to choose one of two paths: stealing and crime, or an honest living to survive. Now, we all praise this respectable man with flowers and applaud him for his health. Thank you. Anything you can do to get more people out here. Here, keep this for now. - Hi. - Hello. Hello, Boo-Boo. Ateh is fine. He's on a bicycle. A lot of people have come to see him. He's getting paid to ride a bike. Good-bye, Boo-Boo. Ateh's waiting. You're lucky. l see wealth in your future. Right here is good. Put the table and umbrella there. Wow. This is really nice. That's why they suffer from unknown diseases. Urinate in this. Here, here. lnto this, please. Get rid of the urine. A little into this tube. Don't spill it! Boo-Boo's fallen off the bed. My salt. Boo-Boo's leftovers. Here, eat. Don't give to, or take anything from, him. What he needs is restoratives. l only gave him a cup of tea. He needs it. My opposing camp is doping him. He's not supposed to give him anything. How do l know there's no morphine in it? Makes him energetic. He's got to eat something after all. Come here and control him with it as well. You go get a doctor. We'll feed him every other meal. His urine test is fine. lf you could give him a shot of B-complex when feeding him, he'll get more energy. Let's go. How long are we going to stay here, Doctor? Our job is to knock him out. lf he drinks this, we won't have to stay here tonight. lt's the second day that this Afghan... lt's the second day that this Afghan is riding. This man right here stopped a train in lndia with the fierceness of his gaze. You've suffered all your life. You are really hopeless. You wish you were young and could start all over again. We've brought you needy old folks here to see that one's prosperity is deeply within his inner self. Let's close our eyes and inspire ourselves with the idea that we are truly fortunate and really hopeful. We are truly fortunate. We are very hopeful. We are truly fortunate. We are very hopeful. You've suffered a lot during your lifetime. Someone is dying! Someone is dying! Get back. Don't crowd. Get back. Don't look. Close your eyes. Don't look. The lines on your palm imply that you've caused a lot of women hard times. You've got a herd of children you don't even know about. None of them. Now someone else has caught your eye. - Mom, could you read his palm? - Damn your dirty eyes! Let go of his hand and come here. He's like the rest of them. All men are the same. Don't trust their childish innocence. They've stolen that innocent look from us women. Let's go. This Afghan stopped a train in lndia with the fierceness of his gaze. ln Pakistan he lifted a couple of bulls with one finger. And now it's the third day this Afghan man is riding. The name of this man is Nasim, or Breeze, but he resembles a typhoon. Nasim is causing a storm! Where are you going, mister? You have to get a ticket. This is a circus. Why did you bring a cartful of bricks? Get this out of here and don't disturb the champion. Get them out of here! Get them out of here! Get them out of here! Clear out. Everybody out. Throw everyone out! Times are bad right now. Do something. Do something. He's about to fall down. lt's too late now. Get him out of here. Couldn't he ride someplace else? ln the middle of town? Who's going to buy tickets in the middle of the city? l'm losing my two million and you worry about a thousand tickets a day. Get him out. How could l do that? Talk to your street peddlers and have them take care of it. l'll get the money together for you. - But, but... - Let's go and see what this guy's done. Move back about a meter. Back up. Back up. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. How many times do l have to tell you? Get out of the way! Don't you see the car? This is the consulate. We've been attacked. We need help. Message has been received. Hello? From the Governor's secretary office. Governor's secretary office to disciplinary units: The consulate is being attacked. The Governor's secretary is at the consulate gate. There's no problem here. Over. l'm not going to be so easily scared. This Afghan does wonders. His name is Nasim, or Breeze, but he resembles a typhoon. This man here stopped a train in lndia just by the fierceness of his gaze, and in Pakistan he lifted a couple of bulls with just one finger. And this time he's going to ride and live on a bicycle for seven days around the clock. Come buy tickets and get your pictures taken on his bicycle. Photos for your scrapbook, publicity pictures. Come on in. Get on. Hold your stuff up. Hold your hands up so everything shows in the picture. Anyone that wants to, please come forward for a picture. Rich people have come to see him, to see this Afghan. This Afghan has gone around the world on this very clumsy bicycle. Nasim does wonders. Nasim does wonders! All right, that's enough. He might be impressed. Sir, the consulate car. - The Governor's secretary? - And you are? l'm the consulate interpreter. Mr. Consular Secretary is in the car. He believes that this show has been arranged to endanger their interests throughout the world. That photographer is not taking pictures just for fun. This show must be ended at any cost. We need jobs, Mr. Governor. We need work! We need work! Hold this. Hold this. Afghan workmen, 200 a day. Afghan workmen, 200 a day. Afghan workmen, 200 a day. Come on. His urea has gone up. l'll give him something to neutralize it. There's something in his urine that l can't make out. lt's giving him energy. We've got to neutralize it. Doctor? Just for a minute, please. l have a message for you. There's a place where they give you a present. Give him a useless drug. Get this show over with sooner. l've never broken a promise in my life. l'm not a double-crossing doctor. The place is getting cleared out. Without customers, your mother will be a guest of the angel of death tonight. Take this and circulate it in the Afghan quarter to attract customers. Afghan circus! Wonder-house! lt's getting dark. Where are we supposed to be digging? Afghan circus! Wonder-house! Cycling! Hey. Hold it. Where are you taking us? Stop! l'll give him a sedative tonight. Doctor, this drug can't be prescribed more than three times. Come on down, down, down. You dig along here as wide as a spade's length. Come on out. We've got some customers. To make more money, l guess that guy is gonna get the mad-house here as well. We'll be lucky to get out of here alive. You leprous patients, appreciate the Lord who granted you the gift of life. There's a place where you are being looked after. This man's wife is suffering from a disease worse than the pains of the whole world. He has to ride for a week to pay her hospital expenses, but you are free to rest, eat, and be content with your life. l heard that one amongst you died, frustrated and hopeless. The grief of impossibility to go back to society brought forth his death. Man lives with his hopes, and l believe it's only spiritual leprosy which is incurable. l'll treat your daughter as if she were my own. lf he lasts three more days on that bicycle, l'll have made my year's salary. l'll marry you. Think about it. l'm a gypsy. l can't settle in one place. Come, come. Come on, come on. lt's not meant for peeling cucumbers. lf you betray me l'll cut your throat. No one knows you're not blind but me. l also bet on him winning. How's it going, Mr. Referee? Want a cigarette? Here. A cigarette. lt's unbelievable, but he's still riding like it's his first day. Put it with the rest of the money. l'll bring more tonight. Listen, you didn't get any rest last night. Take care of yourself. Afghan workmen, 300 a day. Hello, Boo-Boo. This is Aki. Her Boo-Boo works with Ateh. Come, Aki. Are you all right? Hello. He fell off the bicycle last night. Nobody found out. His friend pedalled all night. l told Ateh you're getting better. Ateh is fine. He's got diarrhea. He said he couldn't come for a few days. Three more days. Who let you in? Visiting hours aren't right now. Get under the bed and don't make any noise. The doctor is coming for a visit. Hey, you, get up. You were fooling around again last night, and you came here to sleep? Get up and ride. l've sold tickets. Ride for just three or four people? l've been selling tickets for half an hour. Don't waste time. Hey! l just repaired the motorcycle! What's wrong with you? You take over the job from here. lt's your contract to the end. Come on down. Come down. Start digging from that end. Money! Money! Money! Money! Money! Spit it out. l said, spit it out. You aren't supposed to eat everything. Come on, spit. Spit it out. You shouldn't eat everything. Don't eat it. Don't eat it. Spit it out! l've been thinking. How come you're so accurate with your palm-reading? lt's not that hard. lf the woman isn't married, she's looking for a man to make her happy. lf she's married but not accompanied by a child, she's barren. lf she's holding a girl, it means she desires a boy. Until someone hits the bottom, they won't be able to do palm-reading. What if it's a man? lf it's a man, he must be like one of those l married. l know men well. They're all the same. You remind me of her father. He lived with me for six months and then he took off. l've been hunting for him for eight years. lf you give your consent, we'll look for him together. Get inside. Get inside. lt's freezing. Catching a cold will make him even weaker. - Hello, sir. - l hope you're not tired. - Did you get your check? - Yes, sir. Have you thought of the rain? He can't catch a cold. We're feeding him hot milk, sir. - Can l help you? - Put Nasim through. Pardon? - Put Nasim through. - All right, sir. We know everything. Put an end to this game. We know you're a spy. You'll finally get down off that bicycle sometime or another, won't you? You keep silent? An offer. lf you fall down. Get that receiver out of his hand. Get that receiver out of his hand! Give me that telephone. Watch his son too. Watch out for our bicyclist as well. No one is to get in touch with him either. Listen, Jomeh. That man says your mom is not feeling well. He's going to the hospital. He's asked us to go with him. - Who was that guy? - What did he want with you? Don't worry. Your mom is fine. l've brought you here to take a secret message to your dad. You go and get on his bicycle. Tell him if he falls down and gets the Afghans away from here, we'll pay your mom's hospital bills, okay? Yes. Take this to the hospital tonight. lt's a week's worth of her expenses. Don't let him get on the bike. He's got a suspicious message. Get down, boy. Get down. What are you doing? Don't interfere! Get away. Don't interfere! Jomeh! Get away. Don't interfere. Move out of the way. You want to cause a riot? Get away, man. Want me to beat you with a club? Ateh! What's going on here? Doctor, l can't stand to do this anymore. lt's evil. The referee has been bribed! The referee has been bribed! Nasim does wonders! Nasim does wonders. Nasim does wonders! l've got a message for you. There's someone who'll pay two million if you let him fall down. You've got to get this show over with. That'll get me back where l started. Two million is what l have to pay my competitor if he falls down. l have permission to add a million to it. l'm counting on Afghanistan victory more than that. l'll negotiate. lt's the fifth day. lt's getting too late. lf he doesn't fall by tonight, flatten his tire. There's no other way. Somebody's thrown nails. Come on, pick up the nails. But don't put any in your pockets. Somebody get another bike. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Pull up next to him. So where have you been? Out of the way. Out of the way. Now get out of the way! You've lost your horse, not your dignity. Please, sir. l've got a new bicycle. Let him mount this one. But l'll get out of practice! l've got to practice for the race. l don't have any other bike! All right, here. Take this bicycle and fix the flat, then bring it back and take yours. l don't want you to kiss me. Give me my bicycle back! l've lost track of his blood sugar content. He's falling. Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights! Don't fall asleep! Don't fall asleep, Nasim! Don't fall asleep! Don't fall asleep! Give it to me. Let me add some oil. Here, eat it. Agreed. Four million was remitted to your account. Dismiss the ambulance. Get up now. Let's go. You have a bright future. You'll mix with the upper class. Hey, here's some news. My boss gave it to me on the side. He's finally going to fall. What do you think of that? A milk-coffee for me, and a milk-coffee and valium for him. l can't do that. Give it to him yourself, Doctor. This is the last one. He's not made of stone. He'll finally have to fall. lt's been reported that you haven't given him the pills. Don't risk my career. l heard that this man is poor. l'd like to give him this necklace myself. lt's all l have. l'll give it to him. - Make sure, okay? - Sure. Yeah. The rent, you mean. You increase it every night. The thing is getting bigger every day. You used to sell boiled beets at the beginning yourself, but now you sell chello kebab. l'm not jealous though. lt's the sixth night that this Afghan is doing this amazing feat. His name is Nasim, or Breeze, but he resembles a typhoon. This very man stopped a train in lndia with the fierceness of his gaze. You have gathered here today to celebrate the victory of a hero. One who's proven his ability to circle for seven days around the clock. His popularity is worldwide today. Doctor, wake up. He did it! He did it! Afghan workmen, 400 a day. Five more turns and he's finished. lt's all over. Three cheers! All right, l'm through with it too. Get on, girl. Afghan workmen, 400 a day. Aren't there any? What are you looking at? Go, go. Haven't you left anything? l would like to speak to Nasim at this historic and critical moment. A man whose wife is waiting for him in the hospital. That's right, he's on top now. But what goes up must finally come down. lt's over. The race is over. The race is over. Ateh, the race is finished. Finished. Nasim is a hero, but we need heroes to live in the society with us. 450 a day. Gentlemen, the chello kebab is ready. Chello kebab is ready. How about your wife? Tell us about your wife. Have you heard anything from your wife? He's a legend! Tell us about prosperity. What's your opinion? What's your opinion about prosperity? Ateh, the race is finished. Get off the bike! ln honor of the one who ends this race, hurrah, hurrah! What was your motivation? We need such heroes to return to our society. Then let's ask him to finish this challenge for the sake of his wife. The race is finished. lt's a good slogan: ''The race is finished!'' Finished! Finished! Ateh, the race is finished. The race is finished! A new game. What do you say? Depends on what it is. l'll bet you that by next week, the rarest items in town will be in short supply. What do you mean? Subtitles By J.R.
