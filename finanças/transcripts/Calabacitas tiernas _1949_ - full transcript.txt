Did I hurt my life? I'll take you to the hospital. Oh that naked so abused this. Do not be tough mama, I'll take you. That dirty beggar. First go take a shower. Hail and very good day Don Gume. Hello boy. That the old weapon you have in there. In the window. That works better than many new ones. I would not advise you to enter a shoot with her. And you can not pass me a little. So just borrowing? Look, boy. Things are for sell. Not to borrow. It's an American pistol and you already know that the dollar is floating a lot. That Don Gume is good for me. It's very important to me. Good. What do you want it for? You know... I'm going to serenade you. And how I dress Mariachi. You know, it's not a good one. Mariachi without a gun. I'm just sorry. But it does not convince me. Now. If you let me, your guitar. Because. I'll serenade you with what... But look. I can leave you this lamp. Men. What a coincidence. I just have to then one exactly the same. A couple of days ago I bought it. Good. Take the gun, but. Give me back tomorrow. In the end you are peaceful people and will not do with her no bullshit. Of course Don Gume. You know me. Thank you very much, yes. Good luck. To you too. What a loving thing. Look. I swore that here had the other lamp. Hi, my life. Here's your Robert Mitchum. If you see pothead. Are not you ashamed to walk in these clothes? My life. Here is your future. Is this my little saint? The miracle is what you're doing here. Listen, man. What pure rags. Why did you find work? Only sour cream my old man. But I already know how. Everything consists of go tidy and with soft claw. AND? "I need you to give me a hand." Right now, little brother. But this is not man. He does not hesitate. I need you to borrow a very neat outfit. He's crazy. Do not you know they're customers? I put them on. - Here it is. - But I'll give it back. Make me stop man. Do not be a killer. I need to impress. If. If it all comes out wrong? If I miss the detail? I'll kill myself. Look. But will you give me the suit again? But I'll give it back. - Come on. Goes into. - Really? But it will not hurt me, eh? No way. In the mirror of the soul I made a sweet look. What steals the calm. With the eagerness to love. A deep mystery. I did not know how to see you. The most beautiful in the world. Oops. Where are you young? "Ques que vu vi". "Ques que vous a ve". "Je voutré" to see the "manager". Call it "boié". The ox is you. Even if it comes dressed like decent people I know "rear fly". Men. Paisano. Let me see the manager. Now we are countrymen. I've told you a hundred times already. That the entrepreneur does not receive anyone. "Oui, oui, oui", which is "tritu". That's enough soft talk. Man is not "Evil," man. This is my last chance. You're driving me to suicide. I'm casting out on the street. And if you come back here, I'll break your nose. Shameless. Pay me. Already already. I called to heaven and did not hear me. Cause your doors close me. From my footsteps on earth. Master can be retired. Will we continue tomorrow? We'll let you know. Read. What barbarity. And now? Without a Capitalist partner, there is no magazine and no saint to watch us. A man who looked so formal despite being a millionaire. And with the hidden case that appeared now. And all for a contortionist? Women are women and nothing more. Helen of Troy was a princess. And unleashed a dreadful catastrophe. And what are you going to do? In this historical moment I find myself without any penny and will list the threat of that from one moment to another arrives at Vedete Brazilian that I hired. They say it's a authentic beast of Mato Grosso. Have you seen? Why complain? This is no time for regrets. - You got the car there? - Yes. Let's go for a walk. I need air. Eat a lobster with chilpachole. Goodbye, traitorous world. Goodbye, a thousand years old. Testimony of my last sighs. Tomorrow when my pale remains oppress the earth. From what I've been through the world. Who the hell will remember. I already know who you will remember. Don Gumercindo and Wily. The pistol! My God. Have they taken me yet? Oh no. Here it is. Only thing is thought wrong. Goodbye songbirds. Goodbye lake of Chapultepec. Goodbye Ahuehuetes full of ene. Bye. Goodbye girls. Here's your pachucote. Goodbye everyone, no? Goodbye my life. Even at the time of my death. The women run away. What a bastard. Death! Death! Death! What the hell about Don Gume so bad. Why did not you tell me that this dirty thing worked? No! Young. Young. But happy. Do not. It was not me. It was not me. - Yanita? - What thing? Each day gets more yanita tapas. My name is Lupe, sir. Call it Lupe, but almost now I saw without his robe. That said? "Nevermind." But... Where am I? What are you doing? What do you want with me? - What? What? - Where am I? For you will know it, sir. I just got used to the house. Employee at all, eh? It seems to me that he is delirious. And scared you, love? - Now... - Lupe. You can retire now. I do not like trusts with the maids. Do not think bad things, Nelly. Just started working. And beyond that it is necessary to encourage domestic service. Yes. And you've already called him love. He listened badly. I told him "I'm going". Good. Anything else? Did you find something? Look. There was nothing in his pockets. But it must be rich people. From behind is written that name. Of the Olympics. That caster guy of darts. - Are you back? - Yes. The girl said she is not well. From the head. Is it the blow? Shall we see him? Good. Let's see if this serves you as a lesson. Please. Calm down, sir. Calm down. There is no no reason to be alarmed. Yes but. Where am I? In a safe, protective and affectionate place. So is the chain. But I said I was not. Oh, yes, sir. It was you. I swear it was my bad luck. I'm as innocent as a young lady of 15 years old. Well well. Do not shake please. We will clarify this later. What's your name? Why do you want to know? To warn the police. No! Listen. Understand that we have that save our responsibility. It was your fault. No! See what appointment you have here. Look, sir. Let's go back to his house. Where do you live? - Do not know. - As? I do not remember. But this is not possible. What's your name? Do not know! Is your name Pedro, Pablo, Chucho? Page 2 Force the memory. Peter... Pablo... Chuco, Jacinto and José taracatan, triacatan. No. I do not remember. It's a case of Olympic amnesia. Surely the commotion made him lose memory momentarily. Try to remember my friend. We will see. What's your name? Your family, your friends. Yeah. No. I do not remember. As a child they called me... like this clock. Tin tan. "Tin-tan?" What? Do not you believe it? The beast. I say the Brazilian "do morro". "My God." The Inquisition. They follow me with dogs. Fuzzy dogs. Tell them I'm not. I went to London. That I'm sick. I'm running out. Tell them something. I want to know who this businessman is? Are you the businessman, boy? I want to talk to this entrepreneur, why? After all, Plantation left me more than an hour... Shut up. The Businessman is sick. Please do not disturb me. This Brazilian macaw should give a barbecue and so much. And you believed that I would not have come? Refugee face. I am exiled honoris causa. There. Are you the manager? Look. Take that. - Is sick? - Honey. I swear I did not know. "Will you forgive me, Anjinho?" Oh yeah. Of course not. But what about you? I do not know what I have. I believe that what I have are pains or something strange. Wow. You have an infernal fever. Oh how pale my little boy is. Poor thing. Look. That hair tougher. That's what they did to me anyway. My God. "What is the comb that combs you?" What? What? Who? Who? "What is the comb that combs you?" Ah. The comb that combs me? That's it? Why does it bring you so abandoned? Is it your wife or something? No, no. I'm here to visit. So there is no one to watch over you? No one. Oh, poor little boy. So cute. So cute. Oh, my business. I'll take charge to take care of you. "Oui"? - Oh, what can I do? If deep down I am all spirituality. Me too. I can not see anyone suffer without staying all moved. My little boy so Funny that he is. Even logging, huh. Look. And what do you do standing there with that face of... Just like the face of Biriba. What fear, oh! Who are you? Because. Look. I am the Secretary of the Lord. Your reliable man. Your right arm. We would say. Your other self. Sugarplum. Where is the phone? Mr. Biriba. Why do I want to talk to the hotel to send me the luggage. Everything here, huh. - Here? - Yes sir. I'll take care of myself. Of this poor, unhappy little owl. My yellow monkey face. - Even logos. - Even logos. Take care of him Yes Biriba. Listen. I'm not… Why are you shutting my mouth, man? It can not be. Why did you say that? I'm the businessman? Because you are the famous Businessman Kings. Who I? Naturally. Do you want me to help you remember? We will see. Does not that tell you anything? This room? You do not have the impression of everything here. Is it familiar? Well, listen. As much as I would not say but is very much in confidence. Very tender and their crust with biscuits. Of those broad with sugar spread, this... Morelian chongos? For this proves that you consider yourself in your home. Well, look, I really did not remember. As you improve, you will. Remembering everything. Do not worry. Listen. But it will not be too much too difficult for me to be an entrepreneur? You who believe? No way. Here we are. Secretary and I to serve you. Really? And who are you? And I'm your first assistant. The basis of your projects. And what good base, huh? We are getting. Okay, right? And you live here? No. I live with my mother. Is that good? Oh yeah. Always safer. But do not worry Bring her here. And here we all do together. It is not necessary. I always come here. My God. If I'm dreaming. Save me this Dream at least until you wake up, do not you? Now it is good for you to rest. Expect very strong emotions. Leaves the cement strong For the house does not fall. Do not think about working now. Take a rest. But I already feel very well. I think I should take care of the company's work. No, no, no. You rest now. I get tired. Goose. Said a mosquito when flying could not. Tender squashes. Oh, nice legs. Who spoke? Where did that voice come from? Weird. Have you seen that? The echo? - Ah. - Ah. - Listen. - What? - Who speaks? - The echo. - Ah. - Ah, go. But you do not end? I'm already convinced of what is happening to me that there is something hidden here and it is inside this house a mirror that speaks an easy life and women and women that this is my weak nothing would surprise me if the mirror told me nor would it surprise me that I soon married because if it does not surprise you, we'll talk a little. You're already curled up like a vile goofy you believe in the businessman and die by the legs. In other conditions, tender squash. So it's no wonder the mirror sings to you. Nor should they be surprised that they kiss and deceive you but we have to act together because we are flesh and nail. Can you get me some fuckin 'and I'll give you umaaaaa. Can I take the service? When I'm alone I do these things. Listen to me Lupita. Do not go so distressed. And tell me something. What time do you go to mass? Are you done? Now yes. Why did not you like those verses? No. "Well then?" To me it makes me like you of shrimps with meringue... Calm down and do not be rushed. Let's talk a little bit. I have nothing to talk to you about. I also have a lot of work at home. A little bit and nothing more. You rightfully give me this pleasure. Come here, man. Now. Do not you see that things fall to me? Hold still, man. Already sweetheart, no. Nene, baby. Good. Just load that tray. - Really? - Really. Close your eyes. Let it be a lesson to you. How stupid he is. A cat. Yes, but my old man plays the guitar. Did you notice how the others treated me? I'm made for the fine. Not for the ordinary. Look. Get this delirious my brother. And as a mirror I do not go wrong. What laughs? Here big things will happen and wonderful I think you like things. Very complicated. It would not be my fault. I've always asked God not to give me but to put me wherever there was. That of posing as an entrepreneur can cost your masked know-how. But this will keep wanting. I do not know what happens. It suits me because of the forest. Why did you say that out of the woods? Ah. Do not know? I knocked one down! According to his ideas it was thought decorate this with more classic themes. Even from a Hellenic impression. Look. Already forget Heleninha and put working. This is getting very little. It looks like a box. I need more breadth, more space. Did you get it? Yes. But we have to limit ourselves to these measures. Yes. But how am I going to put my paws here? Here I can not walk the Caetano as I would like. Where am I going to put my show? I can not see any way to increase space. How not? Drop that wall. Drop this other wall. Drop that wall. This wall... do not drop it. But run about ten yards farther back. This is not going to be possible. And why not, My love? Why on the other side is the police department. The police? Oh, then, no. You have to be well with. The jury. But in all the ways that the other drop if you need to buy the houses that you buy them. There. What if they do not want to sell them? In every way that knocks them down. Then give him a tip. I need space. I do not fit here. Look. Look. I can not. Of course. How do you give this breadth of evolution. What did you think was wrong? No, no. Instead. Did not expect you to had such good ideas. I have so many and so good that I do not fit into my cunt. It is said Sir Architect. To knock down the walls, Climbing the ceilings. Down the floors. To widen the walls. With smallness you will not go anywhere. "You understand me, do not you?" Yes sir. Ah. And one more warning. With that wall. Please, do not overdo it.

If in the portrait he does what he does. - Offer double. - According. And a "business" that does not want to pay big salaries. Worthless. You are very right. Grab the phone and give it a message. And that it comes in the first "aeroplato" that leaves there. Perfectly. And now for your Spanish number I have these attractions, mind you. Notice you body. What a face. Temperament and grace for four sides. Yes, by the four cardinal points, which are three. This is the other. This is a very common friend of mine.

Worse than we are we can not be. Let it do what it wants. In addition, if you see his name, who knows what it brings into your hands. What if you do not have any money?

Since we are here for the same price. Why do not we settle some late debts? What do you think? Perfectly fine my "Secre". How many checks do you want? Make me one for about ten thousand pesos for overhead costs. We'll see the others tomorrow. "Tre bien". You're crazy again. See my queen? From here on out for me the pulp is chest and thorn ladder. I see it and I do not believe it. And yet more. I have two checks left. One will be for our little house. And another for our honeymoon in Acapulco. Why do we buy furniture better?

With the utilities of our Cabaret. First of all, our little house. With that I conform. Good. And where do you want it? In Lomas? In Narvarte? In Polanco or in Merito Pasujo de a Repuja?

And will you need them For that same night? Good for today not. But maybe tomorrow. Look. Artists refuse to work if they. Do not make money right now. Tomorrow we go to the bank to get a new one. Look. Do you believe that you will give me? To the male? Then do not come to me. Difficulties. What answers? Of course. Barber talk, sir. A pen. And to what date are we today? The date does not matter. The amount is very clear and in chubby handwriting. But how? What does this mean? Why not a check? Yes. But for that signature. Because he signs with the name Kings. Why should I no longer call myself Kings? To sign checks no. In the bank there is not a penny for that name. God damn it. I've all signed it by that name. - No! - Yes! Listen.

Which mustachioed parrot but parrot is your aunt. Lupita. Forgive me, my life. I believed everything would work out for me. It was too beautiful. I thought with having illusions was sufficient to carry them out. But you see. Everything came out crooked. I believe it is my destiny. The only thing I feel is that I gave you that. Pure illusions. These illusions were the happy of my life. Now what matters is that you leave. It's all the same to me. I failed completely. Do not say that. What does money matter if we want. It is enough to be happy. There. Many thanks Lupita. But now. It's you who dreams. How are things? God is very great. All will be well. Will restart. Soon. Do you have faith in me? Yes my king.

The nerves are gone. How was I? For meddlesome. This could not be so, huh? I've been talking to my college for a long time. And he did a scribble when I taught to rumbar. He told me it was not rumba. The rumba I danced. And the rumba lacked what the fool gave him. And of this beautiful reason since I start rumbera and moving the chair. He invited me without hesitation. Look at my rumbar. Watch me dance. Look at my singing. The rumba we combed rumba. Rumba combs the rumba. The rumba we combed rumba. Rumba combs the rumba. We're on the rumba. That rumba that tomba. Look at my rumbar.

Look at my rumbar. Look at my tire. Look at my dancing. Look at my singing. What story brings you now? He has just confessed to us that the. A bludgeon that shot up high hit a man. Exactly. But he did not kill him as he believes him. And yes, it saved his life. As? Why did this guy try to commit suicide. And how do you know? Because it was me. And it was not only that that in addition to saving my life he had a fortune. How was that? Because. For a financial operation that I believed ruinous. That was the reason I tried suicide. Resulted in a great deal. You were in considerable debt to him. Why did not you look for him before? This is precisely what I have been doing since a month ago. By order of this gentleman. But that, moreover, weighs upon him an accusation of fraud. I'm willing to pay whatever it is required. Good. If there is withdrawal from the accuser. Tomara can fix it. The matter is in your hands. Whatever the cost. Do not worry. Home Sweet Home. Sweet place of dishes. Where the pants. There's always someone to send. Home Sweet Home. No worries. Why here the pants. There's always someone to send. If I wash because I want to I do not need. It's just that I want to be a patriot. They help the city. I'm happy with my Lupita. And since we got married.
