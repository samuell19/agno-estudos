Great, let's tomorrow start with the Champs Elysee, then hit up the Louvre, lunch at La Cafe Marly, a walk down the Seine, perhaps a pre-dinner crepe? Croissant? Oh, no, my trainer has me on a paleo diet. You know that's for cavemen, right? Have you seen cavemen? They're very fit. They also bonk women on the head and drag them into caves. Unlike you, who goes to Paris for a nine-month anniversary. Oh, come on, wasn't a big deal. Please, I have cream cheese in my fridge older than our relationship and it never took me to Paris. Well, I had to go to Switzerland anyway. Chad, stop trying to spoil it. It's romantic, you took me to Paris, the end. Oh, maybe the beginning. You know, this Swiss deal is huge for me, like next-tax-bracket huge. And I was thinking maybe we could enter that tax bracket together. It makes so much sense for us to get married. What do you say? This is all moving so fast, you haven't even met my family. Well, but I'm flying home for Chanukah, I'm gonna see them in a few days. Hanukkah. That's what I said. I'm proposing to you, not your family. You've never dated a Jewish girl before, huh? But they're gonna love me, just like you do, huh? What do you say? Do we close the deal? Yes. I do close the deal, I do! Let's go over the basics one more time, how many nights of Hanukkah are there? Nice try, that's a tricky one, changes every year. What, no, the dates change every year based on the Jewish calendar. No, you said December 8th. I said there were eight nights of Hanukkah. Let's move on, my family runs a? A bakery, but not just any bakery, "Becker Family Bread: A pillar of the community for three generations." My dad's name is? - Frank. - Mom? - Linda. - Brother? - Oh... - Think fast, 'cause he's picking this up in like two minutes. Oh, I got this one. Sagar. - Sagar? - Yeah, he's picking us up, Uber Black. What? Yeah, I figured we could use a nice ride to the hotel. Hotel, what hotel? We're staying with my parents. Think of the hotel like a life raft, we don't have to stay there, but we have it if we need it. - A life raft on the Titanic. - Eh? You've never met my parents. Staying at a hotel would be beyond scandalous. I'd have to wear a scarlet H on my shirt - for the rest of my life. - Hey, calm down, baby. I just need a place to work. This Swiss deal has to be closed by New Year's. I'm gonna be with your family for dinner and Chanukah stuff, but sometimes I need to work and I need stable Wi-Fi. My parents have Wi-Fi. Like stable, like video-conference stable, huh? Sagar? Hey. Yeah, babe, that's Sagar, I'm gonna go to the hotel, get some work done. You have fun with your big brother, put some FaceTime in and we'll reconnect with your parents later tonight. - You promise? - Yeah, cross my heart. Oh, don't tell them about the engagement, please. I wanna do that together, deal? Deal, you wanna shake on it? You might want to take that ring off. Yeah, off. So Esther Schwartz, do you remember her? - Yeah. - Right. She tells me the bagels tastes different. I said, "They do not taste different." She said, "Jacob, the bagels tastes different." I said, "Esther, we haven't changed this recipe in 80 years." But, no, if you think they taste different, the bagels taste different." Oh, my God, I thought that arguing with customers was dad's job. Mostly he just kinda putzes around, keep it... and smiling a lot. Mom's still handling the books, but I have been running the bakery. That's amazing, you're like taking over the family business. I missed you. I really did, how long has it been? It's been like almost two years. I know, I missed you too. It turns out that giving up your corporate job to start an independent food blog doesn't leave much money for vacations. Oh, you know who came home? - This is fun. - Who? Ben. - Ben's here? - Ben's here. What, I'm just surprised. It's like, I just thought he traveled around the world, taking amazing photos. It's like he's in a different country every week. Shut up. I can't believe the Baum sisters grew up in Sol Viejo just a few grades above us. Look at them now, they're like the Julia Child, they're like the Julia Children of our generation. Yeah, and I'm a food blogger who can't even get verified on social media. How'd they do it? Know what dad always says. - Oh, he's not still saying it. - Oh, yeah, he is. "Rachel and Becky Baum" used to come into our bakery every day after school for two pieces of rugelach. Nothing made them happier than my rugelach, "it's probably why they became chefs." It's so embarrassing. It's humiliating, but imagine if it was true. I'm pretty sure that... Where's your boyfriend? Okay, I'm gonna pull around back, I'll meet you inside. Oh, wait, wait, wait! I really wanna see mom and dad's face when you tell them that Chad's staying at a hotel. So, wait for me. I need this. Sarah! - Oh, we missed you, kiddo! - I missed you too. - Mum. - You must be starving. I'm fine. - Are you kidding, I can practically see through... - Mom. What's the last time you had a. Oh, come on, give her a break. Hey, okay, I'm gonna go out and meet Chad and I'm gonna help him with the bags. Oh, Chad's not here at the moment. Oh, honey, what's wrong? Oh, no, no, nothing, he's in Sol Viejo, he's just not like right here in this room. Well, exactly, because he's getting the luggage. See, there's nothing to worry about, honey. No, Dad, Chad has a lot of work to do over Hanukkah, like a lot of video finance conference calls. So, he rented an office for the week. Oh, like a work week. Exactly, except it has a bed in a concierge. Chad's staying at a hotel. Thanks, Jake. I beg you to wait for me. I don't understand, did we do something to offend him? - You haven't even met him. - And that offended him? No, he's just getting some work done and then he's gonna come here and eat and then stay. Oh, good, because your mother prepared her famous briskets. Okay, if he can't make it, I'll just put his brisket in the freezer. - Don't do that. - I don't want it to get cold. Let's get you settled sweetie. Come on, my daughter is home for Hanukah, best gift in the world. Smile. Ben. Hi. What are you doing down there? Honestly, trying to decide if I should tell my Juliet joke or my Rapunzel joke? Let's hear them both and I'll decide. Okay, they are both terrible, just know that I know that. Noted. Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair, unless you are an Orthodox Jew, in which case it's a wig and I will definitely break my neck should I try to climb it. Not a wig, also not long enough to climb, but if you don't mind waiting there, say 20 years. Fine by me. What's the next one, Romeo? - Oh, one sec. - Where... - Hello? - -I think your phone's broken, I'll get you new one. No, my phone's fine. But I texted you two minutes ago. I'm here. Bakery looks closed though, I can make somewhere else. No, no, no, stay right there, I'll be down in one sec. - I gotta go. - Oh, hey... Come over for the first night of Hanukkah tomorrow, I want you to meet someone. Okay. There he is. - Hey, Frankie. - Whoa. Okay. We've heard so much about you. Oh, you didn't tell me you had a sister. Don't tell me you're Linda. Mrs. Becker? No, no, Mrs. Becker is your mother, 'cause you're Sarah's sister. Hi, he's funny. Yeah, Linda, Linda. Okay, what do you do with your wife? This is my wife Linda, Chad. I see rubbing the cradle back then. - Hey, Chad, I'm Jacob. - Hey. I already know I look good for my joke. No, no, you look like a Jewish Ben Stiller. You're right mom, he's a real card. Well, my frat voted me ask clown if that means anything. - It really does, yeah. - Who's hungry? Yes, come on in. Come on in, Linda made a beautiful feast. So, Chad, Sarah tells us you're in finance. Yeah, well, real estate, financing, Crypto, NFTs, PCP, follow the money, you know how it is. Not really, our family has been in the same business for three generations actually. Well actuaries, that's another sector I crashed. Cool, do you know who is from the SV? Oh, here we go. Rachel and Becky Baum. Oh, the cooks. The chefs, but yes, yes. They used to come into our bakery every single day after school, They loved my rugelach, it's probably why they became chefs. My husband, inspiration to the stars. Hey, hey, hey, it ain't bragging if it's true. All right, we haven't let you get a word in edgewise, you must have a million questions for us. Yeah, there's something I've been wanting to ask you. Go ahead, we're an open book. What's the Wi-Fi password? Okay. It means a lot to me that you're here. So, when should we tell my family. About what? That we're getting married. Oh, that. Well, Chanukah begins tomorrow, how about after we light the candles? Perfect, can't wait to wear my ring again. Is this a twin? It's a queen, it's at least a full. Really, can I see the receipt? Come on, it's romantic. Yeah. Babe, couldn't sleep in the doll bed, rolling over to the Double Tree with Sagar, back by breakfast, XO, Chad. There's nobody around for miles, the big guy, huge dude, grabs my camera, smashes it on the ground, hog time, he stick a gag in my mouth. - Benjamin! - Then what happened? Okay, so then they force me to the ground, onto my knees, hold up their rifles right at my head and bam, I wake up, it was a dream. I fell asleep on the Trans Siberian railway. You are a wise guy. It was a very intense dream. Mr. B. My God, Jake, did you hear Ben's story? I'm brightening the color, Mom. There she is, hey, sweetie, look to stop by, Ben from next door. Not ringing any bells. Oh, I also go by Benjamin if that helps. Sometimes I go by Ba, ba, ba Benny, if I'm performing with the Jets. Oh, weren't you the kid that got stuck in the hollow mirrors? No, I don't think so. Yeah, county fair, summer of seventh grade. - Maybe. - Oh, no, you'd remember, they had to shut it all down and extract you through the roof. Oh, so you're saying I got to ride for free in a helicopter and get my face on the front page of the SV Courier because that would be awesome. Ben was sweet enough to take some photos of the bakery for socialized media. Speaking of which, here they are, hot off the press. The photos are in this? Yeah, crazy, right? I'm sure one of your kids can show how to view them. I'm sure they have no idea, Jake... Still great, Mom. So, who is it you wanted me to meet? Oh, where is Chad? Don't tell me we scared him off before the first night of Hanukkah. Doesn't he want to crush the Hanukkah sector? No, nobody scared anybody, Chad just had a work thing. He has a lot of business overseas and with the time difference. You wanted me to meet a business man named Chad? Got it. He's really sweet once you get to know him. Greetings beggars, I come bearing gifts. Feel free to take anything you want, I got multiple... How thoughtful. - I love panda bread. - Yeah, who doesn't? You know we are right above a bakery right this second. Yeah, but this one was open. Yeah. You weren't on my flashcards. I'm Ben, friend of the family, happy to make you a flashcard. Oh, nice to meet you, friend. Okay, who's ready to hit the beach? I brought my long board and I'm stoked. We need to tend the bakery, but you and Sarah should go, enjoy. I actually have some work to do for the blog holiday recipes, get the most clicks. Oh, you you want me to call Sagar and take you to the office? We have a fiber optic Wi-Fi. You know, I think I'll just stay here and work. Jake, you should go with Chad. I would love to, but the is not gonna bake itself. Hey, man, show Chad around town. I can hold down the fort for one day. Frank, the doctor said you should take it easy, that means less work, not more. What I think he said was that you should take it easy on me. I'm serious, I think this is a good idea. You know, I can help. Are you sure? Yeah, I wanted to grab some candid, save Mr. B in action, anyway. Hey, hey, hey, remember tonight is the first night of Hanukkah, I wanna see all your lovely faces back here at sunset for the lightning of the menorah. Yes. Hey. Sarah, bear. What was the all that about dad and the doctor? As hard as it is to believe, your parents are aging and... Is he sick? No, but he has to be more careful about everything these days. What he eats, what he drinks, how hard he works, how hard he plays. Thankfully, we have Jacob and your brother's just doing more and more every year, so. Is that what Jacob wants? Right? I think he'd tell us if he was unhappy. Well, what can I do? I mean, I'm here to help, I wanna do something. You're doing everything, you're gonna create the best food blog there ever was and slap it up there on .net. What are you... Haven't you ever heard of knocking? I knocked like five times. Well, I was working. Your dad wants me to get some shots of you for the new ads. Highlight the family aspect of the business. Why are they doing all these ads anyway? We never used to do marketing. Have you walked around town since you've been back? No. Grab your shoes, time for you to see the new SV. This spot, remember what that used to be? - Remember Greg's? - Greg's! Closed last month? I love Greg's. - And the bookstore. - I know. - Remember that? It's gone. - So unfortunate. Horrible. What happened? Corporate America finally found us, that plus internet. Let's scope out the competition. Free sample. - Thank you. - Thank you. Is this old? I've had better bread on airplanes. I don't get it, why is this place so busy? Same reason all chains are busy. Spent a ton on marketing and they cut corners to keep prices low. There's gotta be something we can do. Why do you think I'm here? Spent the last decade traveling around the world and anytime I wasn't on assignment, I came home to the SV. Each time, another local business was closed, came back this last summer and there's only a handful of the businesses left from when we were kids. So, I decided to stay, see if I could help save them. The bakery. It's doing better than most. Thanks to a bunch of old Jews who would rather starve than eat a black and white cookie your family didn't bake. But they're getting old. My parents? Their customers, and the younger generations, they leave for college and never look back. I'm part of the problem. What, no. That's not... You have a great life in Chicago with Chad. Oh, we gotta get home, it's almost sundown. Oh, time to rock the dreidel I wish Zayde Max was here. He is here. Who's ready to get their dreidel. I am, I am. I'm sorry, are we playing for dimes? It's just a way to keep score. Care to make it more interesting? You don't even know how to play yet. I assume you're gonna show me. It's pretty simple, really? You just spin the dreidel. So the name of the game is spin the dreidel. Literally. It's got four sides, shin, hei, gimel, nun. And depending which way it lands, you either get dimes or you lose them. There's one more rule, fellas, it's a house rule. You land on nun, you gotta drink some. No one wants locusts, right? Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, Here we go, here we go, here we go. Come on, come on. Yeah, whoa! I am the man, one, two. Okay, everybody, this man is a dreidel hustler. Guilty, guilty. The gloves are coming off, Frank, yeah. Oh, bring it, bring it. - Oh, no, no. - Come on, bring it. Bring it. - Let's go, come on, bring it. - Oh God. - Dad. - Frank. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. - Vini. - Dad. ♪ What will become of Frank ♪ ♪ Took a hard one To the upon him ♪ ♪ Will his injury destroy him ♪ ♪ Inflicted by the goy ♪ ♪ Our heart They will for Frank ♪ ♪ Even though they don't know ♪ ♪ It suck ♪ It's just that it's been hours, and so I'm a little worried. Could you look one more time? It's Frank Becker. I don't mean to be a pain, but we haven't heard anything, still. Why are you still here? Out of concern, why are you still here? Well, I just put my soon to be father-in-law in the hospital. Father... Oh, wow. Congratulations. Yeah, that's not a good thing. It's just that it's been hours and we haven't heard... These are my children, this is Sarah and Jacob, could you just look up Frank Becker? Frank Becker. Mrs. Becker, I'm Dr. Bruce. Oh, Doctor, how is my Frankie, is he gonna pull through? Frank is fine, but I do have a few concerns, number one being his drinking. His what? Well, we ran some tests and his blood alcohol levels were quite elevated. No, he drinks on holidays in Bar Mitzvahs, we're Jewish. I see, well, my other concern is his blood pressure. It's a bit high. Again, we're Jewish. All the same, we'd really like to keep him here a few nights and run some more tests. Well, can we see him? Of course, he's in recovery, might be a bit tired, but should be fine, right? Come on back. Oh, God. What a way to spend the Festival of Lights. And more like, more like... Hundred bucks says it goes with lights out. - Festival of lights out. - There it is. You're gonna be fine. Here at Big Wayne's used cars, we've got them new, we've got... Oh, just seeing if I can get the game on. - What game? - Any game. Its Hanukkah week in our kitchen, Vodka, Google, jelly donuts with weird names. Let's show you how to make this Hanukkah the Baum, and join us next week for Christmas cookies. Those ladies are from Sol Viejo. Really? Rachel and Becky Baum. They used to come into my bakery every single day after school, love the rugelach. I gotta get back. - Wait, what are you doing? - No, it's Hanukah, it's the busiest time of the year. No, I gotta... I can't sit here eating Jell-O. Dad, dad, the doctor said you have to rest. Okay, so what? The doctor's gonna pay our mortgage or wave the hospital bill. Frank Becker, you stay in that bed or I will never, and I mean never rub your feet again. You're bluffing. Try me. Dad, I can help out at the bakery while you recover. And I know every big order we have, I'll make sure we get paid. Jacob. What, I already worked there. Yeah, but covering for me. Well, do you remember when Zayde got sick and you stepped up? Well, now it's my turn. Plus, I can easily it's not... You are such a munch. I can help too. How? Well, you said something about a mortgage, if you're struggling with the payments, I can talk to the bank and lower the interest rate. For that, I'll need the assets, balance sheets, inventory, that kind of stuff. You'd really do that? Yeah, your bread and butter is well, bread and butter, but this is my bread and butter. Chad. Oh, if you'll excuse us, Sagar is here, let's go, babe. So, what do you think? Look real leather. Touch it, feel it. Sagar, you're spoiling us, huh? Wait, where are we going? Oh, if I'm gonna help your family, I need a good night's sleep. And also I need to get some work done. You're staying at the hotel again? Bingo. I can't believe that actually worked. What's up? My dad's doing okay, in case you're wondering. I know, I slipped out after the doctor told you. You didn't say goodbye. Yeah, well seem like more of an immediate family vibe. You're basically family. No, but hey Chad will be soon, Mazel tov, by the way. Can we go somewhere and talk? It's the middle of the night, there's nothing open. I know a place that might be open. Haven't been here in years. You know what this place makes me think of? Hard lemonade and clove cigarettes. Junior prom, I asked you to be my date here. Yeah, and then the next day, Tad Yost asked you to be his date and you said yes. I had a huge crush on him. Come on, it wasn't like I ditched you. No, we all went together and then I went home, and you came here with Tad Yost. You still mad about that, like 20 years later? Mad, no. No, I actually learned something really valuable from that, that I never want to be anybody's backup. I know you'll find someone great. Yeah. Are we okay? Yeah, we're good. We should probably get back, your fiance is gonna wonder where you are. Come on. Where's my schmear? Frank always tosses in some schmear. I don't think we sell cream cheese. - Here you go. - Thank you son. Greet your father, I hope he feels better. Say a hello to Harry for me. We do sell cream cheese. No, that's Philadelphia, just keep it around for Mr. Paper. Got it, who's next? Thank you so much, thank you. Okay, bye. Okay, Linda, let's kick the tires on this jello bean. Kick away, come upstairs, I'll open the books. Thank you, honey, I wish your father was still with us. - He's not dead, Mom. - I know, I just miss him. - It's gonna be okay. - I know. Okay, who's ready to spin some more, huh? I don't think we're gonna do that tonight, Chad. Nun, you have to drink. So, how's it going with the accounting stuff? I think it's going well, Chad? I'm gonna stop by the bank later and talk shop with the suits. Thanks, babe, I mean so much. I do have a question, this bakery has been in the family for three generations, right? Why do you still have a mortgage? We took out a loan when Sarah got into college. Oh, college, well, where do you go to college? At the Becker Culinary Institute. - Where's that? - It's downstairs. Our Zayde passed away the summer Jake graduated high school. Zayde ran the bakery, so when my dad took over, he asked Jake to stay and help out. Well, financially speaking, it's a good thing you both didn't go to fancy colleges, once it is Panda, put a bagel size hole in your finance. Anything you can do to help, we appreciate Chad. No, should we tell them? Tell us what? Nothing, not nothing, something, but not now, when my dad's back. I'll get it. Just came to drop something off for your mom. - Is that Ben? - Yeah! Let him in. Would you like to come in? Hi, sweetheart, please join us. Oh, thanks Mrs. B, I can't stay, I just wanted to drop off these, I got some great photos for the new ads. I'm glad you're here. - You are? - You are? Yeah, you know, Linda and I discussed it and we agreed to put a freeze to all non-essential expenses, no more photos. Oh, well, I wasn't charging for these. Yeah, but it cost money to use them, ads, marketing materials, printing cost, ah, it adds up. Well, you can still keep the photos in, use them later. I guess you're not understanding, look, no more photos. Okay, the thing is that I promised Frank. Yeah, do you see Frank? Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank. Not here, no Frank, no photos. Okay, I'm gonna go, happy Hanukkah everybody. - Sweetheart... - Ben, wait. Let him go, this between the family, not the neighbors. Thank you my good man. Remember Frank, take it easy, all right? No strenuous activity, you need to get lots of rest and keep your stress levels down. Mainly you need to relax. Can I get that in writing so I can show my wife? - I'm serious, Frank. - Thank you, Doc. And you, ah, Dr. Bruce, my stress levels are rising. Is this right? Thirty thousand dollars, this is crazy. That ambulance ride cost more than our entire honeymoon, go figure. God, $15 for an aspirin. To be fair, it was two aspirin and it did the trick. How are we gonna pay for this? I think we've gotta ask Chad. Poor kid, he just met us and now we're dragging him to our family mishigas. He wants to help, he's at the bank as we speak. Grab my foot. These numbers are not great. Yeah, tell me about it, what can we do? Depends on the angle. Bottom line, I don't want my future in laws to be homeless. What'd you say the address was? 263 Valencia Street. I'm in real estate, one block from main. Yeah, and great building too, I checked with the county. It was built 1948, a post-war classic. - Good bones I bet. - Great bones. So what's the play here? Technically, the bank holds the building, so you tell me. Alpha by Delta. Alpha man flourish across the land, take that rich bounty, woo. I'm sure we can work something out. - Hey, my man. - Knock it out. Thank, you son, that was beautiful. Okay, if I could have everyone's attention. Up, oh, up is good, right? These are your expenses, Frank. Where do he get the pointer? I think he travels with it. Can we keep the chit-chat to a minimum? Sorry. This are your profits. Wait, sorry, I don't understand, business is fine. Yeah, but the cost of doing business has risen over the years. Meanwhile, your prices have not changed enough - to cover that difference. - Chad, we get by. Yeah, but the hospital bill changed all that. That's you. So, what are you saying? That we have to raise our prices? Okay, price of a bagel, no longer 50 cents, 75 cents. For a plain bagel, are you insane? It's too late for that, you would have to charge $5 a bagel, it's allowed every day to even make a dent. So what are you saying? We're finished, kaput? Not yet. This is the real estate market in downtown Sol Viejo. Oh, great. I'm sorry, I don't understand, what does this have to do with saving the bakery? Not save, sell. He wants us to sell the bakery. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, sell Becker Family Breads, and then what? We move to Boca Raton? You would make enough profit in the business, Boca Raton is totally doable. Yeah, okay, I've heard enough. No, stop it, he's only trying to help. - How is this helping? - I don't know. Frank, with the hospital bills plus the bakeries expenses, you don't have enough in the accounts to pay the next mortgage payment. It's due a week. How short are we? Okay, so we have until the end of Hanukkah to raise $40,000, no problem. You haven't had a $40,000 month since ever, we are talking about a $40,000 week, friend. So what, youknow the Maccabees, they had enough oil for one night, it lasted eight. I have no idea what that means. I know what it means Chad, it doesn't make any sense. There has to be another way. If you don't make these payment to the bank, they seize the property and sell it themselves. You know, okay, then let's get baking. Okay, Jacob, Jacob, go fire up the oven. Honey, I want you to go into my office, find a file marked corporate clients. I want you to call every single one of them tomorrow and tell them that we are gonna have a special on catering holiday parties. Dad, what can I do? Just being here is enough. If you didn't wanna be my backup plan, how come you never ask me out? Well, there are a few reasons, which one do you want to hear? Start with number one. Okay, well you were my first kiss, summer after seventh grade, Camp Shalom. Same. When we got back from camp, things were weird between us for like a month. We were 13, kissing is weird when you're 13. Okay, fair, but it wasn't the last time we kissed. There were three more. Very good, Halloween, ninth grade. I was Hermione. I was Bob Dylan. You grabbed me and kissed me, but you wouldn't take off your sunglasses 'cause you were so cool. No, I was so nervous. I remember thinking that if you rejected me, I was gonna reject you back and say, how does it feel? Third time I kissed you, in the cemetery. You were confused. And I was sad. Your bubbe was, she was the greatest. She was my best friend. I know And then when she was gone, you were my best friend. That's what you needed, I didn't wanna let you down. Boyfriends come and go, but you needed a best friend. You still did kiss me one more time. Oh, yeah, well that time I had no choice. Why? Well, you were oing to college. So? So, wondered if I never saw you again? I wasn't gonna miss my last chance to kiss Sarah Becker. ♪ Talking about Kissing and kissing ♪ ♪ It's close but missing ♪ ♪ Talking about Kissing and kissing ♪ ♪ It's getting there But missing ♪ ♪ It's kinda like Going to a breast ♪ ♪ And they don't Actually cut a thing ♪ Bad example? ♪ Talking about Kissing and kissing ♪ ♪ It's close but missing ♪ - Thank you, Chad. - All yours. So, honey, where are we at? So, the temple placed a big Shabbat order, $800. Oh, and you know Barbara, she's been doing my hair since the last millennium. - Oh, yeah. - So she's retiring... Honey, I'm sorry about your hair, but you need to focus here, okay? Eye on the prize. And the salon is throwing her a retirement party, and they gave us the order, $300. Ah, oh, that's great, anything else? - Not yet. - Okay, well hey, that's $1,000 down, $39,000 to go, who's next, Jacob? What's up? What do you got for us? What was I supposed to do? Come up with an idea to help us save the bakery. Oh, okay, how about this? Instead of going to college, I'll just spend my life working here six days a week for no pay, just room and board, and that's my final offer. Deal. Okay, just make sure she's firing on all cylinders this week, all right? Okay, so, Chad, how did it go to the bank? Any luck getting us the extension? Heading over there as soon as we wrap up here, taking the suits out to lunch. Great, schmooze them until they cave. That sounds illegal, Frank. It just means turn on the charm. Oh, no problem. Excellent, okay, that leaves Ben and Sarah. I spoke to the SV Courier this morning, told them what's going on, they offered to run a free ad for the bakery all the rest of Hanukkah, half page. - It's wonderful. - I'm gonna turn the blog into a giant ad for the bakery all week. The theme is family, friends and food, Becker Family Breads through the years. - Oh... - I love that. And, Mom, do you have any pictures of Bubbe and Zayde when they ran the bakery? Do we know each other? Well, I'm gonna need those, and then pictures of me and Jake when we were kids. I don't have any. And if anyone has an idea for a hashtag, we wanna get something trending on social media. Hash, hash, hash what? - You know, the number sign, Frank? -$40,000, that's the number, Hashtag $40,000 by Shabbat, how's that? You know, Ben and I can figure it out. Yeah, we got it. All right, great, so come on, people, let's get to work. Right, okay, okay. Thank, you everyone. And we have three more orders for tomorrow. Ugh, that's my girl. Chad, any progress with the bank? I think we are getting somewhere, - should know more soon. - Okay. Sarah, whatever happened with that tick tack toe. Oh, the hashtag raise dough? - We got it trending? - Is that good? Unfortunately, it hasn't translated into any business. Was it supposed to? Yeah, Dad, that's the whole point. But wait a minute, that is not social networking for Jews of a certain age. I mean, they don't get the news from Face Jam. - Face Jam? - Well, we put an ad in the courier if that's what you meant. No, wait, wait, hold on, hold on. Linda, honey, when you go to get your hair done, what do the ladies talk about? It's two subjects, they talk about their children and their grand children. Uh-huh. Huh, huh? Jewish geography. Boom, you want all the people who have been here over the years to come back and help, support Becker Family Breads, okay? So you use the oldest slash youngest social network in the world, Jewish Grandchildren. Okay, so do we just start calling kids from school? Do you even remember who was Jewish? No, we could go by last names. Yeah, but that could get tricky, I've been to like two Kirk Patrick Bar Mitzvahs. - Good point. - Yeah. Oh, I got it. Camp Shalom. Duh, everyone at summer camp was Jewish. Even the people who weren't. Guess it's finally time to reconnect with me Old Color War tribe. Okay, I'll start with Abrams, you start with Zimmerman and we'll meet in the middle. Okay, except let me trade you Stacy Rothman for Evan Cohen, 'cause I don't think either of us -wants to make those calls. - No, I don't, I really don't wanna talk to him. I remember the first day you came to work with me. Yeah, I was 16 years old, I wanted a car. Can you hand me the bench scraper, please. You had just turned six, it was me who wanted something, not you. What did you want? I had just been offered a job in Denver, pastry chef at a five star restaurant, my own kitchen. I wanted out of the bakery. You wanted out? Very much so. Brought you with me that day because I had finally worked up the courage to tell your Zayde. I was just a kid, you needed my help? Sort of, nothing made my father happier than seeing you and your sister, thought if he was in a good mood, maybe he'd be more willing to go along with the plan. Was seeing me really that big a deal? Oh, yeah, especially after bubbe got sick. My father worked seven days a week the last 15 years of his life. He only saw you on Jewish holidays when you came to the bakery. - Can I ask you something? - Of course. What happened, what did he say? He didn't say anything, Jacob, because I never told him. It took me years to forgive him for not reading my mind that day. Imagine that. Ruben, my man, we really, really could use your support at Becker Family Breads. Yes, so we'd love to see your mom and dad. ♪ Wherever you go ♪ ♪ Wherever you are ♪ ♪ Someone of the tribe Ain't too very far ♪ ♪ Hey there lunch month ♪ ♪ Born under David Star ♪ ♪ The people of the book Ain't too very far ♪ ♪ Columbus drops anchored Jumps onto a log ♪ ♪ What does he see ♪ ♪ A lovely Santa Gog ♪ ♪ Neil Armstrong Steps on the moon ♪ ♪ Cheers and he pivots ♪ ♪ And whose there To pour cup man ♪ ♪ They might be Wearing dreadlocks ♪ ♪ While waiting on a sax ♪ ♪ They might wear kafia Or a cap like Sandy Kovac ♪ ♪ They might wear light linen Or a thick Polish layer ♪ ♪ But what holds them Together ♪ ♪ Are heart full of player ♪ Sounds like you should get some cream on that, I don't know, I'm not a doctor.

As does Tracy Kramer. We did it, that's everyone. Nice. Jewish geography, right? More like Jewish pornography. Chad. I think it's time for a family meeting, Oh, stick around, Ben, you are practically family. Becker family, I have big news to share. Okay, you asked for my help and I've come up with the plan. Is everyone familiar with the concept win-win? Nope. Is where you win and I win, sounds fair, right? What exactly are you winning, Chad? Your bank payment is due four days and you're not gonna make it. Great pep talk. But that's the bad news, but the good news is I can make it. What, are you willing to loan us that money? I thought about that, but very little upset for me, remember the name of the game is win-win. Okay, so what? Ah, two part plan. Part one, I'm marrying your daughter. I've already proposed, she accepted that deal is closed. Part two, hasn't happened yet, but it will as soon as you default on your loan. I've already made a deal with the bank to purchase the building, Sarah gets me, I get the building property stays in the family, win-win. Okay, say we agree to this. No, there's nothing to agree to. What happens to the bakery? You don't own the bakery? Oh no, no, no, no, that's all yours. Okay, so how does that work? We live up here, we work down there and what we pay you rent? We can get into those details later. I'd like to get into those details now, Chad. Oh, well I'll have to talk to my business partners. Oh, now he's got partners. Yeah, to see the rent comps in the area, but if you wanna stay, I'm sure we can work... Okay, Chad, yeah, you know what? I am so glad that you gave us this presentation. Because of you, I'm gonna make sure that Becker Family Breads has its first $40,000 week ever. Me too. Our surfing secret is off. No. Yeah, oh, it's happening, this man wore a wet suit on a boogie board. Bro code, dude. No, congratulations on marrying my sister. She's the greatest, just ask Ben? - What? - I gotta go bake, but you all need to get some sleep.

Before the break, we added the pumpkin mixture to pasta, and sprinkled a little everything with some bread crumbs. Now let's bake our creamy winter pumpkin pasta for 15 minutes. TV Gods, dissolve us 15 minutes into the future. And now, we should have a nice golden crisp, let's take a look. Can already smell the wintery warmth. Cut. Where's our sous chef? Does anyone have eyes on Scott? Why does this keep happening Alice? Does Scott hate us? Tell us the truth. I don't speak for Scott. Okay, but say you did, say you were Scott, what would you say? Shoot, I overslept again, I hope those nice ladies don't fire my lazy ass. Oh, wait, who am I kidding? They're total pushovers, I've been late like 10 times now and I'm still employed. - Hell, yeah... - And scene, thank you, Alice. - Let's take five. - Let's take five. The network called they wanna discuss your new weightless Mondays. What, did we upset Big Cattle? Hey, Layla. - Layla. - Hi, Mrs. Baum. When did you put out this guacamole? I just put it out. Why is it brown? I think it's just the lighting. Okay, well, why don't we take a taste and see. I'm good. No, you're good, me too, let's take a taste, cheers. It's good, it was the lighting, my apologies. Becky, your therapist called to confirm your session on Thursday. Oh, okay. You're going to a therapist, are you talking about me? What are you saying about me? It's for my knee. Oh, which one? Bad one. I haven't seen you limping. She's a really good therapist. - And your mother called. - What does she want? Well, she said it was something important and to call her back immediately. Well, important means either like somebody died or... Somebody else's kid did something more impressive than creating their own food empire. Poo, poo, poo, let's hope somebody died. Yeah, Alice, just tell our mom that we really wanna talk to her, but we can't because... We're being silenced by Big Cattle. Thank you, thank you. Take a walk with me. Can I see the ring? Very pretty. I'm not really thinking about it right now. You should be. The bakery, there's still time that we can... You know what my mother said to me before I married your father. He'll do. Very funny, she said, this is the most important decision a person ever makes. Things were different in grandma's time. It was, but she was right. Jobs, careers, homes, even bakeries, they come and go, marriage is for the rest of your life. What are you saying? That I'm making a mistake. It doesn't matter what I think, you are so smart, I know you're gonna make the right choice. Not for me or your father or Becker Family Breads, for you. Well, what if marrying Chad is the only way for us to save the bakery? I mean, if he's my husband, he'll obviously let us keep it, right? Why don't you ask him? What's going on? Who are these men? These are my partners, I told you about them. Why are they measuring the walls. In case you want to put in a salad bar. Chad, why are these men in my bakery? Frank, relax, I told you I had partners, they just need to get to know the place. They have to do this now? We have customers. We, since when are you part of the family? Okay guys, we'll start upstairs. Wait, you're measuring our bedrooms. Those men are from Panda. Chad isn't buying this bakery, Panda Breads is. Sagar, this is a violation of driver-passenger privilege. All week I've been driving this jerk around, all he does is make plans to take this bakery from the Beckers. I didn't know you spoke English. I'm from San Diego, idiot. And I love Becker Family Breads just like everyone in this town. Well, I hope you like Panda. Find someone else to file your taxes jointly with. Mom, this should put us over the top. It's fake sweetheart. No, are you sure? I worked at Macy's before I met your father, I know Cubic zirconia when I see it. Sorry baby. I was gonna replace it eventually. All right, Becker Family Breads is closing in 10 minutes. - Place your final order. - Hey, how did we do? Well, we're short. How much? Ten thousand dollars. Well, we had a good run. We sure did. Good evening, everyone, if I could ask you to put your phones in airplane mode, keep them concealed and clear the path down the center through the pastry counter. I'm looking for a Frank Becker. Does anyone here know Frank Becker? That's F-R-A... I am Frank Becker, can I help you miss? Great, if I could just reposition you to the center of the counter. Sure, I can reposition myself. Do you wanna buy something? We're in position, Mezuzah and Dredal are clear to land. Okay, are you just gonna order people around or do you want to order some food? I'd like to order two pieces of rugelach, please. Oh, my God, look how small it is, I didn't think I could remember it. It's small. Oh, God. Oh, Becky, look upstairs. Wait a minute. Hold on, we wavered our initials. That was permanent marker... Becky, it's exactly the same upstairs. Incredible. This is, you're the little... This is the little girl, you're the little girl that was running around. I remember you, you were three when we used to come here. Oh, you know, when we were little girls, the best sound in the world was that final bell at the end of the school day, everybody loves that final bell at the end of the school day. And when you're in grade school, it means you can go play tag or climb a tree, when you're in middle school, it's what's soccer practice or the mall. Yeah, and in high school it's getting high in your car or getting to second base in your car, or both, usually both. But for us, the final bell meant something very different. It meant I was five minutes away from the greatest sensation in the world. The fresh, fruity, cakey taste of Becker's Fresh rugelach. Drooling, you know, we were latchkey kids. Google it. And we didn't know that rugelach cost anything because we didn't think about money because we didn't have any money. Now we have so much money that we've like forgotten about it again, it's weird. It's ironic, we understand. But the point is that, well, we didn't know rugelach it cost anything, but it turns out, it's 25 cents a piece, and I probably had one every day, five days a week for about 10 years. - So did I. - It was on the house, darling. Well, we heard the house could use some help, Frank. You don't owe me anything. This is where we fell in love with food, so, I disagree. Is it Linda? Yes. You still the brains behind this operation? Well, I do the books. Okay, what's a $1.25 a week times 10 years. - Six hundred and fifty dollars - Times two. Thirteen hundred dollars. And then interest. - Oh, interest. - Interest. - So, five percent... - Five percent interest. If you insist, amortized? - Yes, definitely amortized. - Whatever that means. Don't worry, they won't even get close. That's $3,184.35. That sounds fair. - Doable. - Yeah, Alice? Thank you, Alice. We're still gonna be short. They're still gonna be short. After this, we're even Frank. Wait a minute, I don't understand. This is for $20,000. Frank, it's Hanukkah. Hey, aren't you forgetting something? Yeah. Oh, say thank you, Frank. Cheers me. Hey, Chad, now his is what you call a win-loose. Worst Christmas ever. ♪ Home of Hanukkah ♪ ♪ Who will light The chalice ♪ ♪ Who will cook the lotas ♪ ♪ Home, home, home ♪ How do you make those? I'll never tell. How long have you been running this place? Too long. Move to New York, work for us, we need a new sous chef. Nothing would make me happier, but you gotta understand, my father wants this place to stay in the family. And, look, I get it, it's kind of in the name. Well, what about your sister? Why can't she run this place? No, she's busy with her food blog. That does not sound full time, and don't you have internet here? Yeah, yeah, we do. Okay, where's the guy she's in love with live? You mean Ben our neig... No, how do you know that? How do you know that she's in love with him? So, now what? I'm gonna get you drunk and take all your money. And after that. No idea. I gave up my place in Chicago. Something tells me I'm not gonna be moving in with Chad anytime soon. Well, you know, you could always crash with me until you figure things out. And I only have a twin bed, it's pretty uncomfortable. Why are you so good to me. Isn't it obvious? No, I'm messy, I'm impulsive, I'm picky. I constantly buy fruit that goes bad before I get around to eating it. You refuse to drink tap water. You have to pet every single dog you pass, you suck at throwing rocks and you take a really long time to figure things out. Exactly, who needs all this? Should we do it? I mean, it's the quickest way, it worked for you in Jeff Schultz at Camp Shalom. Oh, yeah, okay, you're coming to New York. Just watch this. All right kids, we're gonna play a little game, stand up. This is a game my great aunt Esther, our great on Esther taught us. What's it called? I'm glad you asked this called Menorah in the Middle. How do you play? Well, with this menorah between you, and you stare deeply into each other's eyes until I pull it away. What happens when you remove the menorah? Well, that's the best part of all, you kiss. I'm going to New York, I'm going to New York. Can I talk to you for a second? Yes. I don't know how to say this, but I've been... I said yes. Oh, wait, but what about... Don't worry, we'll be fine. Just walk away before he changes his mind. Hey, you never told me that Romeo joke. Actually, I didn't have one, I just always thought of you as my Juliet. Come on, come on, come on, you two it's starting, come on, move it, come on. It's time, it's time, it's time. Here we go, here we go, here we go. We've got a huge show today, not only are we making a pastry that tastes like our childhood wrapped up in a flaky crust, but we are doing it with our very own brand new sous chef who's gonna tell us about his very personal connection to this very tasty concoction. Please give a big long welcome to Jacob Becker. Tell us what we're making today, Jake. Becky, we're making rugelach, which is a traditional Jewish pastry. And we're using a recipe that was created by my Zayde. That's grandfather for you Gentiles out there. Zayde means grandfather, and would it be safe to say, Jacob, that this is your Zayde's baby? Because that's fun to say. It is fun to say and it's true because he taught my father, my dad passed it on to me, and it is an honor to share it with each and every one of you watching at home. And I hope you'll bake along with us, and if that's too much, just follow along in the shared spirit of tradition, creation of a profusely dense pastry of family and love. Jacob, I don't know if you know this, but when Becky and I were kids, we used to walk to school. And every day on the way home, we would go to your family's bakery and your dad would give us two piece of rugelach, and, boy, was it delicious. ♪ Zayde and bubbe Of blessed memory ♪ ♪ Said opened up the store ♪ ♪ Of Becker Family Bread ♪ ♪ A blessing on your house And a blessing on your head ♪ ♪ Meanwhile There's bread to bake ♪ ♪ Get your tuches Out of bed ♪ ♪ A little heavy On the Bechamel ♪ ♪ Light on the Mayo ♪ ♪ The secret for escaping The ♪ ♪ We finally have A sous chef ♪ ♪ Worthy of the name ♪ ♪ Jacob Becker is gonna make Himself famous in the game ♪ ♪ I'm in New York on my own ♪ ♪ But don't say I'm alone ♪ ♪ I'm on TV and oi I found a nice Jewish boy ♪ ♪ I bake color in a spiral ♪ ♪ My food blog's Going viral ♪ ♪ The bakery is for loving ♪ ♪ Got a bun in the oven ♪ ♪ I really made a killing ♪ ♪ In these NFTs ♪ ♪ Never will I set Foot again in the SV ♪ ♪ I got my taxi fixed The insurance covered it ♪ ♪ I no longer drive for Uber I'm now a podiatrist ♪ ♪ Frank watch Your hypertension ♪ ♪ Shift it down a gear ♪ ♪ Is someone Actually working? ♪ ♪ I came in for some shmear ♪ ♪ When you see the moon ♪ ♪ Rising over Sol Viejo ♪ ♪ Just know I see the moon too ♪ ♪ And I'm thinking of you ♪ ♪ When you see the moon ♪ ♪ Rising over Sol Viejo ♪ ♪ Just know I see the moon too ♪ ♪ And I'm thinking of you ♪ ♪ Just know I see the moon too ♪ ♪ And I'm thinking of you ♪ ♪ Just know I see the moon too ♪ ♪ And I'm thinking of you ♪
