(dramatic music) (blasting) (booming) - The continued wave of death-dealing explosions struck yesterday at area defense headquarters as in previous occasions the authorities are unable to detect the cause of these blasts which have done untold damage. Who could possibly be doing this? - Well there are several theories Joan, but so far no one is even sure what kind of explosives are being used or how they're set off. Maybe Mr. Henderson will have some information for us when he gets in from Washington. - That guy Henderson wouldn't tell you what time it is. Just what is his job anyway? - He won't tell you that either Ted, it's a big one. He only answers to a few people in this country of ours. I think that-- (knocking) Hello Mr. Henderson. - Hello Commander Cody. Ted, Miss Gilbert. How are you getting along with the rocket ship? - As well as can be expected sir. Our test with the model is satisfactory. If the government will let us make a few test flights with the rocket-- - It's out of the question. This whole project is strictly top-secret. Since you people developed the rocket ship for us and we'll be the ones operating it, it has been decided that you should know more of our plans. I've been authorized to tell you this much: its primary use will be to combat this wave of sabotage and destruction of our defense system. - You mean the government knows what's causing it? - Not definitely, but tests of the wreckage show that the explosions are of atomic origin. - You mean someone's dropping atomic bombs on us? - Not bombs; no planes have been observed, and the explosions aren't severe enough. - No, from what I've learned of the nature of the blast they see more like an atomic ray of some kind. Of course that's just a guess. - It's the same guess that we've made because it's the only possible answer. - [Cody] But no one has ever been able to make an atomic ray machine. - You mean no one on earth ever has. - Say, this rocket we're building we'll be able to fly to the moon, maybe someone up there's built one that could get down here. - We believe that possible, and for some time our astronomers have been noticing an unusual amount of atomic activity on the moon. Atomic activity on the moon. Atomic blasts on the Earth. The two known facts fit together. - Yes, it adds up. So that's why you want us to fly to the moon. - Yes, and when you get to the moon find out if these attacks are actually coming from there and try to devise some plan for stopping them. In the meantime we'll do we can with these attacks here. Is your flying suit still working? - Yes. - We may ask you to use it. If a ray gun is being used to cause these blasts, it's probably being operated from the ground and if you could get to the scene of the attack soon enough, you might be able to find some clue to the attackers. - I'll be glad to try. - Good, we'll phone you as soon as we have any information about another attack. - All right, sir. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. (light instrumental music) (horn honking) - There she is, right on time. (blasting) (dramatic music) (chuckling) Well, that did it. Let's get over to Kern Pass. That troop train will be along soon. - All right I'll get out there right away. Say, give me a hand with the flying suit, Ted. - Sure. - A trainload of army supplies was just blasted off the west end of the valley. A rancher reported he saw a truck parked on a hill overlooking the tracks with two men in it. Working some kind of a gun. They pulled out right after the wreck and headed toward Kern Hills. Henderson's office gave a description of the trucks and I'm going out to look for it. - I suppose you'll be wanting this. - Yes I may need it. (light dramatic music) (blasting) - She ought to be along anytime now. (chugging) Okay get set. Now! (banging) - Let's get out of here! - And leave the ray gun? - What else can we do? - The loss of the ray gun is not too serious. I brought sufficient equipment from the moon to build several of them but I do not care to have the Earth people learn the secrets of our weapons. From the description you gave me of your attackers costume it must have been Commando Cody in his flying suit. He will probably take our ray gun to his laboratory for examination so you must go there at once and recover the atomic chamber from the ray gun. - That's a large order Krog. We hired out to work your ray gun, this business-- - You were hired to do anything that I may consider necessary to pave the way for our invasion from the moon. You're being well paid for your work, so do as you're ordered. - Okay. (light dramatic music) - Is working on this gun going to hold up finishing the rocket ship? - No, I'll just give it a quick examination and then turn it over to the authorities. We'll still be able to take off for the moon next Wednesday. - Take it easy and you won't get hurt. Move back. There's the unit we want, grab it. (dramatic music) (clattering) (grunting) (thudding) (banging) And don't try to follow us. (light spooky music) - [Krog] Krog Calling Retik. Krog calling Retik. - Come in, Krog. - A rocket ship is leaving here in five days to investigate our moon. - I did not believe the earth men possessed a ship capable of making the journey. - I just learned about it myself but I'm sure my information is correct. - Very well, it is not too serious. We will be prepared to take care of the visitors when they arrive. - I still think this is no trip for a woman. - Now don't start that again, you'll be very glad to have someone along who can cook your meals. - I'll say we will. Don't give her any more arguments. - Okay, I like to eat too. - Well boys that's it. - Well the best of luck to all of you sir. Hope this thing works all right. - So do we. See ya, bye. - Goodbye, sir. - Hiya, folks - Hello Hank. All set? - All warmed up, we can take off right now, that is if the ship will stand up to the test we made with the model. - I think it will. Now, let's go. Safety belts fastened? Fire pilot jets. (air hissing) (light dramatic music) Fire main jets! (whirring) - Right, well you'd hardly know we were moving. - Well, believe it or not we are. A lot of miles per minute. - She's living up to the test we made. Set a course for the moon. - Right. Take over here, will ya, Ted? (light suspenseful music) We're just about here. Looks like we're on the right track. We ought to be down in another two hours. (whirring) There's a city just ahead. - [Hank] Where do we sit down? - Let's take her back in those hills where we can find a place to hide the ship and I'll fly over the city in the rocket suit. - Okay. - Settle down in that canyon. - Okay. (clattering) (blasting) (light dramatic music) - You are going in the right direction, Earth man. Enter the first door you come to. Turn the control, the door will open. (creaking) Welcome, Commando Cody. I am Retik, ruler of the Moon. - Apparently you are expecting me. - Of course. For many years our radio has kept us informed of events on Earth and my men there have advised me of your every move. - I see you have adopted our language. - Yes, all our people are required to speak English so we can operate more efficiently in your country. - You mind telling me why your men are carrying out that campaign of destruction on Earth? - Not at all. They are merely softening up your defenses for our impending invasion. - Why do you want to invade the earth? - Because the atmosphere on the moon has become so thin and dry it is impossible for us to raise food except in pressurized greenhouses and none of us can move outside without helmets so we are planning a mass migration to your world. - You will find that conquering the earth isn't so simple. - Ah, but it will be because of our atomic weapons on the Moon we have an element, Lunarian, which is far superior to uranium as a base for atomic reactions and we can completely control the force of these reactions enabling us to build atomic weapons ranging from huge cannon to these small ray pistols. - It's very considerate of you to give me all this information. - You deserve some reward for your long journey, but unfortunately I cannot permit you to return to Earth with it. - Maybe I have something to say about that. (dramatic music) (whirring) - So much for the effectiveness of your weapons. Now I will demonstrate one of ours. (blasting) (dramatic music) Seize him! (clattering) (thudding) (blasting) (clattering) (blasting) (dramatic music) (thudding) (blasting) (clattering) (booming) (creaking) (blasting) (light dramatic music) (buzzing) - So Retik plans to invade the Earth with his army from the Moon. As soon as the saboteur's, he already has their finish softening up our defenses. - Do you think he'll be able to do it? - I'm afraid he might. I don't know how many men or rocket ships he has, but his atomic weapons are so far ahead of anything we have he wouldn't need a very big army. What did you find out about the ray guns? - Only that they use an element called Lumarium. instead of uranium as the base for their atomic reactions. They apparently can control the reaction so they will work either as a disintegrating ray or as an explosion like our atomic bomb. - Well if their weapons are that powerful it would be impossible for our people to attack them here even if we had rockets enough to transport an army. - That's right. Apparently they let us land because they weren't afraid of a single ship but they would undoubtedly blast it at an invading fleet. - Then hadn't we better go back right away and warn our people? - Our orders were to find out if the attacks were coming from here and if so, to try to figure out some way to stop them. - And those are large orders. All we have is a light machine gun and some hand grenades. They wouldn't do much to that walled city. - No, but there was one of their ray guns in Retik's laboratory. If I could get hold of that it would be easy to blast open their pressurized buildings and really put them out of business. - All you've gotta do is get the gun. - That may not be too tough. We brought some nitrous oxide with us, didn't we? - Yes there's a small tank of it. - I'll find the air-intake that leads to Retik's laboratory and turn the gas into it, that ought to put them to sleep long enough to let me get away with a ray gun. - If it's like the gun you found on Earth it'll be too heavy to carry, let alone fly with. - That's right, but the tripod isn't important. I'll dismantle a gun from the tripod. I think I can handle a gun all right. - Maybe you can but it'll be quite a load. I better get a helmet and go with you. Hank and Joan can stay here and guard the ship. - Okay, I may need some help with that. (light suspenseful music) You better not come any closer. I'll fly on in and get the gun. I'll manage to lug it back this far myself. - [Ted] With the whole town chasing you? - [Cody] I don't think they can get around outside very well, but we'll find out. (dramatic music) (blasting) - Nesor, something's wrong the ventilating system. Get the oxygen. (thudding) (creaking) (clanking) (dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (crashing) (buzzing) Guards, guards! The Earth man has escaped with a ray gun, send a car out to search for him. (rumbling) - You got it. - Yeah. But it sure is heavy. - Is anybody after you? - Not yet. Give me a hand with this. We've got to move fast. (suspenseful instrumental music) (rumbling) - [Guard] He must have come this way, he couldn't have got by the guards at the canyon bridge. - [Guard] No, and he won't move very fast carrying that gun. There they are, give them a blast. (blasting) - [Ted] What do we do now? - [Cody] Let's try to keep going. Maybe we could dodge around those rocks and lose them. - [Ted] They're still after us, let's go. - [Cody] That looks like a cave, let's get in there. - [Guard] We can't follow them in there. Set the ray gun at constant heat, it will melt the cliff and bury them alive. - Right. (dramatic music) - [Ted] What's that? - [Cody] They turned the ray gun into the side of the cave and it's melting the rock. Let's get back as far as we can. Never mind the gun! (dramatic music) - [Guard] That will finish them. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (bubbling) - [Cody] Maybe we can get out along that side. - [Ted] But what about that tank? - [Cody] We may be able to take care of it. (suspenseful music) Let's try this one. - [Guard] That will finish them. - [Cody] Get me a hand grenade. (booming) - [Guard] They must have gotten out, let's move out of here. (rumbling) - [Cody] That does it Ted, let's get back to the rocket ship. - Too bad you lost that ray gun. You'll have a tough time getting another one now. - We haven't a chance of getting one, and we couldn't possibly attack their city with any of our weapons. - That isn't the worst of it. They've already tracked us halfway to this ship so they know about where we are. It's only a question of time until they find us. - One blast from that ray gun will pop this ship like a toy balloon. - Maybe we better get back to earth. - I think so. We've accomplished the most important part of our mission; we discovered that Retik is planning to lead an invasion from the moon as soon as the saboteurs finish softening up our defenses, and it's up to us to get that information back to Earth. How soon can we take off? - Well I've gotta build up the pressure in all the tanks and warm up the jets, maybe a couple hours. - Then get started. I'll fly out and scout around until you're ready. (light suspenseful music) (clicking) - Scout Seven reporting to headquarters. Scout Seven reporting to headquarters. - Come in. - I found the earthman's rocket ship, Your Excellency, it's in a canyon only about a mile west where our scout car was attacked. - Splendid. I'll send another car out after it at once. Stay there and keep watch. - [Scout] Yes, sir. (blasting) (dramatic music) (thudding) (smacking) (blasting) - The scout found our ship. I took care of 'em but I'm afraid he already reported us. How much longer before we can take off? - [Ted] One of those tanks is headed this way! - How 'bout it, Hank? - I won't guarantee the results but we can try. Here it goes, all jets. (hissing) (light suspenseful music) Looks like we may make it. - If we get out of range of that ray gun in time. (rumbling) (booming) (rumbling) - Shut off that induction valve! Protect the other compartments. - Right! (blasting) - Well, that one barely reached us. Looks like we're in the clear. - Things are sort of messed up in there, but nothing serious. - Okay, Hank, you can start for the earth now. Make a 180 degree turn. - Right, Commando. Homeward bound. - Very well. Patrol car reported that the spaceship has escaped. - That ship must not be allowed to land on Earth. Retik to Krog. (light music) Retik to Krog. - Come in, Retik. - Commano Cody's rocket ship has escaped and is headed back to Earth. He has all the information about our planned invasion and must not be allowed to tell it to the authorities. Will you have a ray gun completed by the time he lands? - I'm afraid that is impossible, Your Excellency. - [Retik] Then use of bomb any other weapon available. That ship must be destroyed before anyone could get out of it. - Yes, Your Excellency You heard the orders. - Yeah but it might not be that easy. There may be guards at the landing field. - Nevertheless you will carry out instructions. I will furnish you with a bomb, you can devise some means for placing it under the ship the moment it lands. - How do we know when they'll get here? - I'll pick up their approach on my radar so you can be in position when they land. (light music) - Just like we figured. - Yes, we've got to blast them, then plant the bomb before anyone can get out of a ship. - Here she comes. (rumbling) - Going in for a landing. Calling landing field. Calling landing field. - Landing field to rocket, come in. - We're coming down. Is the field clear? - Yes, sir we're all ready for you. - All right, Hank, make your 180 degree turn. - You take the one on the right. (banging) (dramatic music) - Let's get over to the car! - We'll never make it now, let's get outta here. (rumbling) - They're taking off in a car. I'm gonna go after them, you guard the ship! (engine rumbling) - They're after us, step on it! (tires screeching) He's hanging onto us, give it all you can. Stop on that bridge! (tires screeching) (frantic dramatic music) (hissing) (booming) (dramatic music) (tires screeching) Stop on that bridge! (light dramatic music) (hissing) (booming) (splashing) - So the people on the Moon are planning a direct attack on the world as soon as their saboteurs have softened up our defenses. - What do you think their chances are of succeeding? - You've seen what the ray guns have already done here. If they send out a fleet of rocket ships armed with atomic weapons like those or perhaps even larger ones it would be difficult to hold out against them. - Perhaps our best move would be to attempt an attack on the Moon. - We'd be at a terrific disadvantage. I don't even see how we could land ships there in face of their ray guns. - But we just can't sit here and wait to be attacked. - No, of course not. Retik the Ruler told me they plan to attack after their saboteurs here have accomplished their mission. If we could round up the gang operating here we may stave off the attack until we are better prepared to meet it. - Yes that's certainly the first thing to do. You know some of the saboteurs don't you? - Yes, well that is by sight. And my flying suit gives me a considerable advantage in running them down. - Right. I'll have you notified whenever there's another attack. In the meantime we'll put every available man on this case. Goodbye Cody. - Goodbye sir. (light dramatic music) - I'll have this ray gun finished in a short time now so you'd better arrange to get another truck to mount it in. - Okay, but I'll need some more money. You'll have to sell some more of those jewels you brought down from the moon. - I've only a few of them left and I must keep those for an emergency. It will be necessary for you to take up your career of bank robbery. - Not me. I'm already on parole for that. - I know but you would be wise to continue to obey my orders. Your more recent activities would be of extreme interest to the authorities. Will you need someone to help you? - Yeah, but they'll have to do the dirty work. Of course I'll go along to check on them. - Very well, make your arrangements at once. Select a bank which is located in a not too heavily patrolled area. (light dramatic music) (alarm ringing) - Something went wrong. Here they come. (banging) (engine rumbling) - After that car. Step on it! (banging) - We oughta lose 'em now, we're out of traffic. (crashing) - But we must have more money. You've got to get it somehow. - Not by any more bank jobs. I'm too hot in that business now. We'll have to figure out something else. - I'll radio the moon, perhaps Retik can advise us. Krog calling Retik. (light spooky music) Krog calling Retik. Krog calling Retik. - Come in, Krog. - I have to report that our scheme for obtaining money was a failure Your Excellency. Can you suggest some plan that might be more successful? - I think I can. From what I hear of activities on Earth kidnapping important persons and holding them for ransom has proved highly profitable. Commando Cody who threw his rocket ship to the moon is very valuable to the defense organization of his country. I suggest you select him. - An excellent idea. We shall carry it out at once. - It'll be a rough deal, but a lot safer than robbing another bank. - Of course. Commando Cody should be worth at least $100,000. - Shall we bring him here? - No. Hire a plane and take him to... (light instrumental music) (tapping) - Where's Cody? - [Ted] Right over there. (dramatic music) (thudding) (clattering) (grunting) - Now will you tell us where Cody is? - I don't know. - Why don't we grab her and use her to trap Cody? - That's an idea. On your way sister. Wait a minute. (light dramatic music) - What happened? - Those same two men who wrecked the ray gun, they came after you. - Where's Joan? - I don't know, maybe they took her with them. - Two men and a woman drove away from here just as I came in. They were too far away to be recognized but it must have been them. Police headquarters. (engines buzzing) (dramatic music) (tires screeching) Okay I'll tell him. The police found out that the car went to the Eastside Airport and a man took off with Joan in a trotted plane. They left just a few minutes ago. - If I'm lucky I can catch them. (blasting) (dramatic music) (engine rattling) - Don't get excited, sister. I'll take care of him. (banging) (clicking) (dramatic music) - He wrecked the controls. (booming) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) - He wrecked the controls. - [Cody] Get into that parachute. (booming) - What became of that man? - [Cody] He must have landed somewhere near here. If you're sure you're all right, I'll look for him. - Oh, of course I am I'll walk over to the road. - [Cody] Okay. (blasting) (dramatic music) - How about a ride to town mister? - Well sure, hop in. (blasting) - Man in a flying suit chasing us, step on it. - Huh, are you crazy? - Don't argue, step on it. (banging) That stopped him. You keep going. (rustling) - I must report to the Moon. Krog calling Retik. Krog calling Retik. Krog calling Retik. - Come in Krog. - I have to report another failure, Your Excellency. We were unable to capture Commando Cody and hold him for ransom. - You still have no funds. - No, sir. And until we can get a ray gun into action again we are unable to continue our campaign against Earth's defenses. - Listen carefully Krog, I cannot have my preparations for invading the earth delayed by such a minor detail as obtaining a small amount of money. If the men you now have cannot accomplish this simple mission then hire someone who can produce results. This is an order! - I understand, Your Excellency. You heard. It's up to you to decide whether you can still be useful to us or... - We'll figure something out. - Remember that payroll job Duke was trying to get you in on? Maybe he'll still go through with it. - Well? - It's risky but it might work. It's the Western Wholesale Supply Company. They keep their payroll in the office safe every Friday night. There's a man in the office who knows the combination. (alarm ringing) (dramatic music) (whistle blowing) There's a cop, get going. (banging) - Hold up men in a black sedan. They took the turn to the right. (dramatic music) (tires screeching) (banging) - They're gettin' closer. We can't get caught with the payroll on us. Watch where I throw it, we'll pick it up later. (clattering) - We finally got a break. They called me down to the jail hospital to see if I could identify a prisoner and he turned out to be one of those two who've been making all the trouble for us. - Well how did they catch him? - Well he and another man staged a payroll robbery. The police went after them and the car crashed. The other man was killed but her pal was only banged up a little. - What did you find out about him? - His name's Graber, he's an ex-convict out on parole from a bank robbery sentence. - Well what about his connection with the invaders from the moon? - I haven't had a chance to find out yet. There were too many people around the jail hospital so Henderson asked me not to question him there. We might be overheard. - But aren't they going to try to find out something? - Yes. They're going to move him under guard to a private sanitarium where we can question him without any danger of the story leaking out and throwing the whole country into a panic. - When will that be? - Probably this afternoon. Henderson is going to let me know as soon as they make arrangements for having him transferred. I'd like you to go with me Ted. - Sure. (light dramatic music) - I got some news about Graber. A friend of mine's a trustee in the jail hospital and he tipped me off they're moving Graber out in an ambulance this afternoon. - Is there anything we can do about it? - Yeah I got it all figured out. Now my friend told me which road the ambulance is taking and I'll-- (light dramatic music) (tires screeching) - Start walking across country. Go on! - What about the driver? - I sent him hiking. - You should have slugged him. As soon as he gets to a phone he'll have the cops on our trial. - Nah, it's okay. There's a car parked a few miles up the road to pick you up. - Okay, let's go. (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) - It's about time you got here, the cops are after you already. - What? - Yeah it's coming over the radio right now. - [Dispatch] Calling all cars, calling all cars. The stolen ambulance was last reported turning onto the east end of Harrison Canyon Highway. - I told ya you should have slugged that driver. - [Dispatch] Calling police headquarters, calling police headquarters. - It's Cody. - [Dispatch] Police headquarters, come in. - [Cody] This is Commando Cody, I picked up your broadcast and I'm just turning in to the west end of Harrison Canyon now. If I meet the ambulance I'll stop it for you. - [Dispatch] We'll get some men up there soon as we can. - That's a bad break. What's he doing out here? - Probably on his way to third degree me. I'll go back to town with you Sam. You keep going with the ambulance until you can ditch it. If you meet Cody first smash him. - Right! (engine rumbling) - Do you think we'll meet them on the road? - We got a good chance to. (suspenseful music) - There it is! It's gonna crash into us! (crashing) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Do you think we'll meet them on the road? - We've got a good chance to. (dramatic music) - There it is! It's gonna crash into us! - [Cody] Bail out! (crashing) (light music) - Here's the payroll. We found it right where it was thrown. - Splendid. Now we can-- - Retik calling Krog. Retik calling Krog. - Yes, Your Excellency? I was just about to call you to report that we are about to put our ray gun into operation again. - I have another mission for you first. Do you have an atomic bomb strong enough to start a volcanic eruption in the Mount Aldo Crater? - Yes but an eruption in that mountainous area would do very little damage. - On the contrary, it will do a great deal of damage. The present atmospheric conditions on Earth indicate that the eruption would cause torrential rains and the resulting floods should seriously disrupt transportation and defense measures. - Excellent idea. We shall carry it out at once. - Very well. Then start an intensified campaign with the ray gun. Earth's defenses must be completely broken down before we can risk an invasion from the moon. - Yes Your Excellency. You heard the orders, charter a plane and drop one of our atomic bombs into the outer crater. Nature will do the rest. - Okay, when do we do it? - At once. I will get you the bomb. (light suspenseful music) (rumbling) (dramatic music) - Here it goes. (booming) - If the moon men did start that eruption they certainly got results. - Well somebody must have started it. That volcano has been dead for years. Took quite a blast to get it going again. An atomic bomb dropped from a plane would seem to be the only answer. - You know Commando Cody thinks that maybe-- (door clicking) - How'd you make out? - I think we're on the right track. The second airport I checked had chartered the plane on the day of the eruption to two men answering the description of Graber and his pal. - Then we're right. They're the ones who bombed the volcano. - Looks like it. - Yes but that doesn't help us catch them. Couldn't you get a line on them? - The names and addresses they gave were phony, but I did get one break. The airport manager borrowed these matches from Graber and forgot to give them back. - Al's Cafe. That might do us some good. - It at least means they've been there and if we're lucky they might be regular customers. So let's go and look the joint over. - Right. - If we hear anything Joan, we'll give you a call. - Yeah I know the guys you mean. They come in here pretty often but I don't know their names or anything about 'em. - Well, if they show up I wish you'd call me. - Oh, sure. I sure will, Mr. Cody. - Thanks. (dramatic music) (thudding) (clattering) (shattering) (grunting) - Drop it or I'll drill him. If you or the cops try to follow us I'll give it to him quick. - They took your pal Mr. Cody. You gonna call the cops? - I don't dare to. They'd kill him sure. (banging) (dramatic music) (tires screeching) - [Daly] We'll never find him down there. - You're right. And as soon as he can get to a phone he'll have the cops on our trail. The road to Clark Mountain is just up ahead. We'll hide out there until Krog can send us another car. Calling Krog. Calling Krog. - [Krog] Come in, Graber. - We just had a run-in with Cody again. Our car is hot. We'll have to have another one. - [Krog] Where are you? - We're heading up to Clark Mountain. We'll stop before we get to the top and wait there. - Very well I'll have another car out there as soon as possible. (dramatic music) - What do you think they'll do to him? - Oh it's hard to tell. They'll certainly hold him until they-- (phone ringing) Cody Laboratory. Ted, where are you! - In a gas station on Highway 17. I jumped out of the car and gave them the slip. - Good work. Now we can go after them. Where are they heading? - They were going up the Clark Mountain road. - I'll use the rocket suit and try to find them. - Okay. Don't worry about me I'll come right back to town. - Phone the police and tell the block to highway on the other side of the mountain. - Right. Police headquarters. (dramatic music) (blasting) - Hey, Daly. Quit worrying. Car can't get here for a while yet. (dramatic music) - Hey, hey it's Cody. (banging) (dramatic music) - It's time to get out of here. Follow me, keep low. (dramatic music) When Cody gets here give yourself up. Try not to get too close to him. - But look-- - Don't argue, do what I tell ya. (suspenseful music) - [Cody] Don't move. Drop your gun. Where's Graber? (thudding) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - When Cody gets here give yourself up. Try not to get too close to him. - But look-- - Don't argue, do what I tell ya. - Don't move. Drop your gun. Where's Graber? (thudding) (dramatic music) (whooshing) I got the flying suit under control just before I crashed but I'd lost my gun. When I tried to look for Graber and his pal they had disappeared. They'd must have taken over the hills on foot. - So where are we now? - About back where we started. Except that we do know that Graber's been hanging out at Al's Cafe. - They'll probably never show up there again. - But I might find somebody around there who knows them. Anyway I'm going to give it a try. I'll call you later. - Sure I've seen him around here and talked to him a few times but I don't know anything about him. - What'd you talk to him about? - Well I'm a mechanic and the last time he asked me to do some work on a truck motor for him I couldn't handle the job so yesterday it was, I told him to try Benson's over on the south side of town but I don't know whether they ever went over there or not. - I'll check up on that. Do you know Benson's address? - It's on Central between 14th and 15th. South side of the street. - Good, thanks. - I'll let you know if they ever turn up here again Mr. Cody. - Good, see you later. (light spooky music) - Krog calling Retik. Krog calling Retik. - Come in, Krog. - We have the new ray gun ready to mount in a well camouflaged truck Your Excellency. And are prepared to renew our campaign. - Good. What are your first objectives? - Since the authorities here learned of your planned invasion from the moon, there have been heavy troop movements in this area. We plan to concentrate on destroying troop trains. - Very well. Work as fast as possible. We must have Earth's defenses completely disorganized before we start our invasion from the moon. - Yes, Your Excellency. Is everything ready? - Yes, we can pick up the truck and get going. - Here are the timetables. The map with the best points of attack indicated. Cover as many of them as you can today. - Right. (light dramatic music) - No, I don't remember anyone answering that description but of course we run a lot of jobs through here and I don't know all the drivers. - How about these trucks that are in here now? - Well this one and this one are a couple of my regular customers. That was a cross-country job it came in last night for an ignition check. I didn't see who the driver was, the night man took care of it. - Okay if I look it over? - Sure, go ahead. (rattling) (clanking) - Get away from that truck. - Hey, what's going on? - Frisk him. - Stay out of this or you'll get hurt. - Now look, I don't want any trouble in here. (dramatic music) (grunting) (thudding) (clattering) Let's roll. (engine rumbling) - That truckload of radios was a phony. That whole back end was a fake door. I'm sure they're planning and hiding something inside. - Probably a ray gun. - That's what I'm afraid of. They'll probably start blasting again any time now. I've sent Ted out to the airport to stand by in a plane with some light bombs. Soon as we hear of any ray gun attacks I'll fly out and try to locate that truck and radio Ted to bomb it. (phone ringing) Cody Laboratory. All right, we'll be right out. They just blasted a troop train in the east end of Carson Valley. Radio Ted to take off and in a plane at once and fly around out there. I'll contact him as soon as I spot the truck. - Right away. Calling Ted Richards. Calling Ted Richards. (dramatic music) - [Cody] Calling Ted Richards. Calling Ted Richards. - This is Ted, come in. - [Cody] I've spotted the truck. It's going along a dirt road just east of the end of the valley. - I'll be right with you. - [Cody] Okay, I'll keep them in sight until you show up. (dramatic music) - Cody's after us again! - We'll stop him, use the rifle. (banging) Did you get him? - No, but I scared him off. - So he'll fly back and tell the cops where we are? - So what? By the time they get out here we'll be long gone. - [Cody] Ted, Ted. - This is Ted. - [Cody] You're headed the right direction, just keep going I'm coming aboard. - Right. (dramatic music) What gives? - The truck's just ahead. Fly over to that dirt road. - Okay. - [Cody] Where are the bombs? - Right there. - Right a little. That's good, just keep going. - Okay. (booming) - What was that? - There's a plane up there, he must of bombed us and looks like he's coming back for another try. - I'll stop. We'll give a blast with our ray gun. - That was pretty close but drop down a little lower next time. - Okay. Hey, they've stopped. - Looks like they're aiming a gun at us. Dive on 'em, quick! - Okay. (engine rumbling) - Hurry it up, he's diving on us again! (booming) Ya missed! - He came too quick. Turn the truck around, I'll get another shot at him. - Right! - [Cody] They're getting set for another shot at us. Get going. (booming) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Ya missed! - Came too quick. Turn the truck around, I can get another shot at him. - Right! (engine rumbling) - [Cody] They're getting set for another shot at us. Get going. Better bail out. - Okay. (booming) (dramatic music) - It's going to be a serious problem organizing any system of defense against those ray guns. - It's practically impossible unless we build ray guns of our own. - We can't do that without lunarium as the base for the atom reaction. - That's right. So if it meets with your approval I'll make another trip to the moon and try to get a supply of lunarium. - Do you think you can do it? - I'm not sure but it's worth trying. Anything is better than sitting here like tin ducks in a shooting gallery. - I heartily agree and if you're willing to make the attempt you can certainly have permission. How soon can you start? - Right away. The rocket ship is all fueled and ready. Joan, phone Hank and tell me get the jets warmed up, we leave right away. I want to get started before there's any chance of the news leaking out so Retik won't be laying for us when we get there. (light dramatic music) - Well boys, that's it. - Hope this trip is as easy as your last one. - Thanks, it should be. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, sir. - Hiya, folks, here we go again. - Hello, Hank, all set? - Any time now. (engine rumbling) - Safety belts fastened? Fire pilot jets. (hissing) Fire main jets. We're full speed, Hank. Set a course for the Moon. - Right! (light dramatic music) - Take over here, will ya, Ted? We're just about here. We oughta be down in another two hours. (hissing) I can see the city now. We don't wanna get too close, so swing west, Hank and head to that same canyon. - Okay. - We're almost to the canyon now. - Okay, I'll take her down. - All right, set her down. (dramatic music) - You sure you don't me to go along? - No, not this time. This is just a scouting trip to try to find where they keep the lunarium. - [Joan] How do you expect to do that? - Well if I'm lucky I'll be able to capture one of the moon men and get some information out of him. (light dramatic music) (buzzing) (blasting) (dramatic music) - [Cody] Do you want me to cut off your air again? - [Moon Man] No, no. - [Cody] Where is the lunarium stored? - [Moon Man] I will tell you. - Think I'll pass? - Sure, you'll pass all right, if that joker told the truth. - He wasn't any position to lie very well. Now it's just lucky I picked up one of the men who guard the lunariam. If we're gonna get there in time for you to take his place we better hurry. (light dramatic music) It's a little after 9:00. I'll go right in, you find a place to hide and watch for me to come out. - [Ted] Okay. (creaking) - [Moon Man] About time you got here. - [Cody] I was delayed. (banging) (creaking) (buzzing) You've got it! - [Moon Man] Yes, it's so heavy it's going to take us a week to lug it back to the ship. Get out of sight, quick! (engine rumbling) (creaking) Come on. - [Moon Man] Parol number six reporting. (suspenseful music) That is all, very well. (rumbling) This is patrol number six. Somebody stole my car, send another one quickly. - [Cody] How's the fuel pressure? - [Ted] Seems okay. - [Cody] Make all the speed you can. There he is. That's right where they're amiss. That might stop it. (booming) - [Ted] What was that? - [Cody] A ray gun blast. See what's behind us. (dramatic music) - [Ted] There's another car chasing us. We'd better use our gun. - [Cody] We'll have to turn around to do it. There's a bunch of rocks ahead that will give us some shelter. We'll wait till we get there. (suspenseful music) - [Ted] It's heading for some rocks, we'll have to stop it. (booming) That's our feed pressure line, we're stuck. - [Ted] I'll say we are. - [Cody] Pressure's down to nothing. - [Ted] I can fix this if I have time. Fly out and try to stop them with your grenades. - [Cody] Okay. - [Moon Man] They stopped behind a rock, but I think I can blast them. (blasting) (booming) (air hissing) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - [Ted] There's a bunch of rocks ahead that will give us some shelter. - [Moon Man] He's heading for some rocks, we'll have to stop him. (booming) (clattering) - [Ted] That's our feed pressure line, we're stuck. - [Cody] I'll say we are. - [Ted] Pressure's down to nothing. I could fix this if I have time. Fly out and try to stop them with your grenades. - [Cody] Okay. - [Moon Man] He stopped behind a rock. But I think I can blast him. (dramatic music) (booming) (booming) (rattling) - What was that? (air hissing) We're stuck! - So is the other car. - [Moon Man] Let's go after him with our ray pistols. - [Cody] Feel better? - [Ted] Yes. Did you stop them? - [Cody] For a little while, but I don't know for how long. - [Ted] You better go out and see what's happening while I try to fix that feed pressure line. - [Cody] Okay. (dramatic music) (booming) (booming) - [Ted] Hey! (rumbling) Get Hank and put this aboard. Get set for a takeoff as fast as you can. I'll ditch this car. - [Cody] Right. - [Hank] Okay we're ready. - Right. - [Moon Man] Aren't you going to let me go before you leave? - No we're taking you with us and you better go back to your quarters until we get started. Get going! Safety belts fastened? Fire pilot jets. (roaring) Fire main jets. (hissing) Well, we're on our way. - And am I glad. I'll go get us some coffee. (thudding) (dramatic music) (grunting) (air hissing) (clattering) (banging) - What'll they do with him Hank? - It's just like a burial at sea, Joan. Only his body will float around in space forever. - Everything okay, Hank? - She's under control now. - Good. Make a 180 degree turn and head for home. - Okay! (dramatic music) (light music) - Retik calling Krog. Retik calling Krog. Retik calling Krog. - This is Krog, Your Excellency. - [Retik] The rocket ship from Earth has been here again and has escaped with a supply of lunarium. - That's serious, now they can build their own ray guns and prevent your invasion from the moon. - Of course. So their ship must not be allowed to land. Calculate the time of their arrival and have your ray gun set up ready to blast them. This time you must not fail. Your own life and the future of our people are at stake. - I understand, Your Excellency. You heard the orders, there must be no bumbling this time. I will draw up a detailed plan of operations. (dramatic music) - There we are. We ought to be able to pick up the good ol' Earth on a scanning screen pretty quick. - Here it comes, right when Krog figured. Wait'll it turns in for a landing. - Okay. - All right, Hank, make your 180 degree turn. (blasting) - Going in for a landing. - Any time now. (booming) - That was a ray gun blast. Take her up again, quick! - Quite too soon, it wasn't close enough. - Keep going up, we've got to stay out of range. - Okay, but then what? We're almost out of fuel. Gotta set her down sometime. - It's probably Graber and Daly on a truck with a ray gun. I'll try to stop them! - Still climbing slow, but it's way out of range. - Well, they'll have to come down some time. - Yeah but we're gonna have trouble first. Here comes Cody in his flying suit. Get him in your sights and blast him when he gets close enough. (dramatic music) - If I wait for him to get any closer, he'll be right over us. - Then take a shot at him! (booming) (dramatic music) - Well this is it, folks, we've gotta turn back and land before we're clear outta fuel. - Rocket's coming in again. Get set for it. This time, wait'll it gets so close you can't miss. (rustling) (suspenseful music) (banging) Through the ray gun at him! (booming) Forget him, get the rocket. It's almost down. - Now what? - We gotta get Cody first, give it a blast. - I can't get at him behind that rock. - Then hit the cliff above him and bring it down on him. (booming) (rumbling) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (banging) - Forget him, get the rocket. It's almost down. (banging) - Now what? - We gotta get Cody first, give him a blast. - I can't get at him behind that rock. - Then hit the cliff above him and bring it down on him. (booming) (rumbling) - That get him? - Can't tell. But we missed the rocket, it's already landed on the other side of the hill. - Maybe we can blast them before they get a chance to unload. - No, there'll be too many guards there, we might lose the ray gun. We'd better pull outta here. (dramatic music) (spooky music) - This is serious. And Cody did escape, I heard the announcement over the radio. I must report to the moon. Krog calling Retik. Krog calling Retik. Krog calling Retik. - Come in, Krog. - I have very bad news, Your Excellency. Commando Cody has upset our plans for destroying the rocket ship and the lunarium has been landed. - This is intolerable. If the Earth people use that lunarium to build ray guns they will be able to repel our invasion. - [Krog] I realize that, but I did my best. - Your best is not good enough! I'm going to fly down to Earth at once and take charge of operations myself. - I will welcome your help. - Apparently you need it. In the meantime, have your men go after Commando Cody and any other key personnel they can reach. We must delay the completion of any ray guns on Earth until my invasion fleet is ready. - Yes, Your Excellency. (dramatic music) Cody and his assistants must be destroyed. - The lunarium arrived safely at the government atomic laboratory and they've already started converting it into a compound suitable for use in the ray gun. - How long will that take? - Some time, I'm afraid. The element's entirely new to our scientists, and they'll have to build considerable equipment to handle it. - Well I hope they can get it ready before the moon men attack. - Do you have any idea when the invasion may be expected? - No. The moon ruler told me himself he was planning the attack, but he didn't say when. - The time element is vital. Let's go over in detail what happened on your trip to the moon and perhaps we can find some clue to when they plan to strike. - All right. Well, our passage through space was uneventful. The rocket ship functioned perfectly. When we reached the moon, I decided to go on a scouting trip. (light suspenseful music) (door creaking) - Welcome, Commando Cody. I am Retik, ruler of the moon. - Apparently you were expecting me. - Of course. For many years our radio has kept us informed of the events on Earth, and my men there have advised me of your every move. - [Cody] I see you have adopted our language. - Yes. All our people are required to speak English so we can operate more efficiently in your country. - Do you mind telling me why your men are carrying out that campaign of destruction on Earth? - Not at all. They are merely softening up your defenses for our impending invasion. - [Cody] Why do you want to invade the earth? - 'Cause the atmosphere on the Moon has become so thin and dry it is impossible for us to raise food except in pressurized greenhouses. And none of us can move outside without helmets. So we are planning a mass migration to your world. - You'll find that conquering the Earth isn't so simple. - Ah, but it will be. Because of our atomic weapons. On the Moon we have an element, lunarium, which is far superior to uranium as a base for atomic reactions. And we can completely control the force of these reactions, enabling us to build atomic weapons ranging from huge canon to these small ray pistols. - It's very considerate of you to give me all this information. - You deserve some reward for your long journey, but unfortunately I cannot permit you to return to Earth with it. - Maybe I have something to say about that. (whirring) - So much for the effectiveness of your weapons. Now I will demonstrate one of ours. (dramatic music) (booming) Seize him! (thudding) (clattering) (booming) - We decided we would need a ray gun if we were to attack the city. So the next day, Ted and I went back and turned nitrous oxide into their ventilating system. When Retik and his guard became unconscious, Ted waited while I went in and got a ray gun. But before we could... (dramatic music) They're still after us. Let's go. (rumbling) - [Ted] That looks like a cave, let's get in there. - [Moon Man] We can't follow them in there. Set the ray gun at constant heat. We'll melt the cliff and bury them alive. - [Moon Man] Right. (dramatic music) - [Ted] What's that? - [Cody] They've turned the ray gun to the side of the cave and there's no way to run. Let's get back as far as we can. Never mind the gun! (rumbling) - [Ted] Maybe we can get out along that side. - [Cody] But what about that tank? - [Ted] We may be able to take care of it. - Let's try this way. I hated to lose that ray gun, but it would only have been good for a few shots without another charge of lunarium. - And now that we have a lunarium, we can build our own ray guns and pistols. - Yes. We brought back one of their ray pistols. - [Henderson] Looks fairly simple. - [Cody] Yes, would you like me to take it apart to show you how it works? - [Henderson] Please. (dramatic music) - There's the intake for the air conditioning system. Put the hose in and turn the gas on. (whirring) Let's find a spot where we can watch the window in case anyone tries to get out. - We must start manufacturing these weapons at once. - Wouldn't it be better to save the lunarium for bigger guns? They're what we'll need to stop an invasion by rocket ships. - Excuse me, but isn't getting awfully stuffy in here? - I'll open a window. (dramatic music) (banging) (glass shattering) You better get her out of here, Mr. Henderson. (thudding) - It won't open! (thudding) (dramatic music) (light dramatic music) (hissing) (banging) - You better get her out of here, Mr. Henderson. (rattling) - It won't open! (thudding) (alarm ringing) - We'd better get outta here, that'll bring the cops. - We can't yet. (clanking) (sniffing) Well, I guess that finished him. Let's get outta here. - I'm all right now. - He seems to be coming around all right. - Somebody took a shot at me from outside. I'm going to go look for them. You'd better stay here with him. (light dramatic music) (banging) It's Graber and Daly. Come on! - I'll drive. - Okay. - [Henderson] What's the matter? - Somebody stole my car, I've gotta get to a phone to report it. - [Graber] There's a car following us, keep rolling. (banging) - We'll have to get closer. - [Dispatch] Calling all cars, calling all cars. A black sedan has been stolen from in front of Cody Laboratory. Last seen going north, get after it. - Cody must've taken the cop's car. I hope they take after him instead of us. (engines rumbling) - We've got some help, there's some motor cops right behind us. - What if the cops are on our side? All we have to do is stay ahead of Cody a little longer. (gun banging) - I'm out of shells. Try to get alongside and I'll use that gas grenade. - He's catching up with us. (thudding) - Try again, that threw me off balance. (banging) (coughing) (tires screeching) - [Joan] I can't see a thing! - Something's wrong with their car. Slow down. (crashing) - Get out with your hands up. - [Officer] We'll handle this. - Wait a minute, officer. I'm Commando Cody. These men tried to murder us in my laboratory. - Yeah, well all I know is that you stole the police car, so I'm taking the whole buncha you down to the station. Come on, get in the car. All of you. - Certainly, officer. That's a good idea. - You must've done some fast talking to get out of that. - No, as soon as I convinced them who I was everything was all right. - Did you find out anything from Graber and Daly? - Not a thing. They denied they ever used the ray gun or that they have anything to do with the planned invasion form the moon. - But you can testify that you've seen them using the ray gun. - I could but I'm not going to. - What? - My testimony could convict them, but what good would it do? They're just hired thugs. And whoever is boss of this show could easily hire someone else to operate the ray guns. - But it's ridiculous to turn those murderers loose. - I know it looks that way, but it's the only way to locate their headquarters and perhaps smash the whole gang. - How do you figure that? - Well, I've instructed the police to release them and trail them until they leave town. Then they'll radio me and I'll take over. (light dramatic music) - Still can't figure out how we got out of that so easy. - Yeah. Did seem kind of phony. There's a car back there and it might be tailing us. - Do we run for it? - Not yet. Take it easy till we make sure he's after us. - [Dispatch] Calling Commando Cody. Calling Commando Cody. - This is Commando Cody, come in. - [Dispatch] Your men are headed out of town on Highway number 19. They are driving at a moderate rate of speed. They should pass the city limits in about five minutes. - I'll get out there right away. Well, I hope it works. - Good luck. - You're sure you won't need me? - No, Ted, but thanks anyway. (blasting) (dramatic music) - That car turned off so I guess it wasn't following us. Head for the cave. - Right. - I can't understand why they let you off so easy, but it's very fortunate you came back when you did. Retik has arrived. He came down in his personal rocket ship. He landed it in the cave in the east side of the old Mount Henry mine. I just spoke to him by radio. He wants us to arrange for four more trucks and eight men to operate the ray guns he brought with him. - [Graber] Okay, we'll go to town and get 'em. - [Cody] Get those hands higher. (dramatic music) (clattering) (grunting) (thudding) (crashing) (sizzling) (screaming) (gun banging) (sizzling) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (spooky music) (dramatic music) (clattering) (thudding) (grunting) (sizzling) (screaming) (gun banging) (sizzling) - They're both finished. - [Daly] So what do we do now? - This is Retik, ruler of the Moon. You will carry out Krog's orders. Get the men and the trucks necessary to operate my ray guns and bring them here at once! (dramatic instrumental music) - And there was enough metal in my flying suit to partially ground the current so I was only knocked out, but the other man was killed instantly. - From what you've told us, he must've been the leader of the Moon forces here. - I think so. But now that Retik is on Earth, he'll take command. And if Graber and Daly carry out their orders, he'll soon have a strong force of men and ray guns. - Then we must capture him before he can get organized. - If he has ray guns there, it won't be easy. - No, but at least we can get the ray gun in Krog's cave and use it ourselves. - I'll arrange to have it picked up at once. - If you will have it mounted on a truck it can be taken directly from there to the mine. - Ted and I will go out and scout around so we can move in on them as soon as the ray gun gets there. - I'll get it to you as quickly as possible. - Yes, sir. - Do you know exactly where the Mount Henry mine is? - Yes, it's an old abandoned one. It has two entrances and a-- (phone ringing) - Cody Laboratory. Yes, he's here. - Hello? - This is the bartender at Al's Cafe, Mr. Cody. - [Cody] Yes? - Those two men you asked me to watch for just came in. They're talking to some other fellas. Looks like they're tryin' to work up a deal. - We'll be right down. Graber and Daly are at Al's Cafe. We have time to pick them up and still get to the mine before the truck. That's their car, all right. (dramatic music) Get to your feet. Search him. (thudding) (dramatic music) (grunting) (clattering) (crashing) (thudding) - Come on, now. (suspenseful music) - They're after us, keep rolling! (gun banging) (tires screeching) (horn honking) (crashing) (booming) - No chance of getting them out of that. - No. Let's go after Retik. Everything all right? - Seems to be. - We were delayed getting here and I don't know what the set up is in the mine. So you stay here with the gun while we do some scouting. - Yes, sir. - Should be here by now. Go out to the mine entrance and see if there's any sign of them. - Yes sir. - Let's take a look inside. (suspenseful music) (gun banging) (thudding) You take that tunnel, I'll take this one! (blasting) He's getting away in his rocket, let's get to the truck. Get the gun ready, quick! (booming) - Now that Retik's dead, we feel sure there's no immediate danger of any enemy invasion from the moon. And we'll have time to build an adequate defense. - Will you want us to make another trip to the moon to see what's going on? - I don't think so now that the moon men's attack has failed. We can make the whole story public and the military authorities can take charge. But we will need more of your rocket ships, Commando, so I suggest you make plans for going into their manufacture on a large scale. - Before we get started on ships using regular rocket fuel, let's do some experimenting with atomic power from lunarium. - That might be pretty hard to control. - No, I've got it all figured out. Stand back, please. Look, by setting the controls on this model rocket, I can make it slowly circle the room and come right back. Watch. Here we go! (hissing) (shattering) - I thought you said it was going to slowly circle the room and come back. - At least it did come back. (laughing) (light instrumental music)
