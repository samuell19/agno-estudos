(KOOKABURRA) How do you do? My name is Senator Douglas Manton, and I'm the Australian Minister for Culture. You know the world has enjoyed some very wonderful cultural renaissances, insofar as culture is concerned. The Egyptian Dynasty... The very wonderful Greek civilisation... The grandeur that was Rome... The Italian Renaissance, and the artistic glories of France. However, none of these very wonderful movements can compare with the Australian Cultural Renaissance which is sweeping the world at the present period of time. You know we Aussies are pretty slow to blow our own trumpets, but I think I can say without fear of successful contradiction that among the many fields of artistic endeavour, in which we Australians have shown such wonderful leadership, is the art of the motion picture. The fillum which you are about to see now makes me proud to be an Australian.

For madam, monsieur, an aperitif? Ah, no tea, monsieur, no. Though they look very fresh. No thanks, all the same. I never eat on an empty stomach. - Wouldn't mind a nice cold ale though. - Pardon? I'm that thirsty I could drink out of a Japanese wrestler's jockstrap. Oh Barry don't make such crude remarks about our dear little stunted, slant-eyes yellow friends! - You got frogs' legs, haven't ya? - Oui monsieur. - Well hope off and get us a drink. - Mad Australian! Strewth Aunty, what are you doing? Oh, it's just a little tiara I picked up in London, Barry. Isn't it gorgeous? I'm going to wear it to the Opera House for the first night of the Algerian Space Circus. I'll be the cynosure of all eyes. - I was right. It's her. - You are sure? But she has glasses. The queen does not wear glasses. - She's incognito, imbecile! Then the man is Prince Charles. Imbecile. Prince Charles has a mole on his right buttock. That man is a Royal Body Guard and he's built like a brick shittenhausen. Wake me up when we get to Gay Paree. No worries, Aunty. He must be liquidated. - Dan's after the blonde stirring... Hey, Bazza! - Scrotum Baker, you old bastard! - Can you keep one down? Just watch me! Better than that Pommie piss! Baker! - Get one of these up ya! - Yeah, right mate, ta! - Going back to Oz, lads. - What route are you taking? No-one mate. Travelling with my Aunty Edna. Geez! Cop the Frog hostie, Bazz! Bet she's a box tosser. - I could be in there up to the apricots and off like a grenade. - Plenty more of that in Paris, mate. - Dunno. Bloke can pick up Christ-knows-what from one of them Continental sheilas. Mate of mine knew a bloke who told him he had a friend who's mate's nose dropped off after going chockers with a Frog! Oh, Marcel! Back in a jiff, fellas. Just off to rinse the prince. - Yeah, righto, Bazz. See ya. - Righto mate. - Hi! Dr. Delamphry! - Oh! Mr. McKenzie, my dear. Former patient of mine at the clinic. I'd like you to meet Miss Rhonda Cutforth-Jones, editor of 'Jet Set'. Pleased to meet you. Hiya, horny! Ah, look, Doc... Madam fought off the guard! I'm glad I got this chance to talk to you private-like, Doc. Well McKenzie, you couldn't have chosen more intimate surroundings. It's the sheila's. I've got this little problem. You're right McKenzie, it is a little problem. I mean, how come a good-lookin', clean-cut Australian like me gets so many knockbacks when some dirty, greasy, ikey, no-style old bastard like you scores it for a knee trembler with an Abo in an airborne dunny? Sorry Doc, I hope I didn't get you with me gong beater! - Ya dacks drip dry? - I should be so lucky! Mr. McKenzie, in answer to your romantic problem, Miss Cutforth-Jones and I are on our way to Paris for an international sex seminar- Christ and the Orgasm. Perhaps you and your delightful wife might care to join us for some of the lectures. That's me Aunty Edna. Oh, we there yet, Barry? No, Aunty. This is Dr. Delamphrey and Miss... Cutforth-Jones. How do you do? I've just been having my beauty sleep here. We've been trying to persuade your charming nephew here to look into some of our theological seminars during your stopover in Paris. I'm sure you'll both find them spiritually uplifting. Oh do come, Mr. McKenzie. It's fascinating. Do you realise that a high percentage of young men are unable to find sexual satisfaction? You don't say? How do you work that out? My magazine conducted a door-to-door survey. Strewth, you can't expect for a bloke to crack it for a fat on his own front doorstep! Furthermore, our questionnaire revealed that a starling proportion of males under twenty-five find themselves virgins. Lucky bastards! Barry, we're in Paris. Isn't it exciting? I believe it's almost as cosmopolitan as Sydney. - No worries, Aunty. - We must not lose touch. I want you for the male centrespread of my October issue. The chicks who read my mag are bananas about you well-hung Aussies, darl. - Beauty, Rhonda. - Barry, dear, hurry up! - What's that Aunty? - Just an old metal detector, Silly Billy! - Come along dear, quick stick! Frog bastards! Hello, I would like to make a reverse charge call to... Transylvania. You old bastards! Come on over! How are ya! (WOLF HOWLS) Plasma Castle... Plasma speaking. Just reporting, master. - We have located the Queen. - A chantée, Mon princess. We are quite sure, but the bodyguard was bristling in weapons. Stiff cheese, hey Baz, the fuzz bustin' your Fosters! No prob, Skeet. Always manage to keep a couple of spares up my sleeve. Master, he's still armed. Some kind of a Molotov cocktail. None of your whimpering excuses, cretin. I want Her majesty in this castle - by noon on Friday night. And if you harm so much as a hair... on her legs... You know the consequences! I smell success. Clothilde, this calls for a drink. Dorothy, the Queen of England, with a little encouragement, will be spending her holidays in our nice country. Once she has tasted the delights of Transylvania our tourist industry will be the envy of the world. Dorothy, I tell you, I have a hunch about this. So have I, master. So have I. Hey Baz, meet Col the Frog. He comes from Melbourne but he's been knocking around Gay Paree for donkey's years. He's a bit of an old bludger, but he knows where the action is. Speaks the lingo perfect. - Bonjour, monsieur. - G'day! Tre bonze to meet ya. Barry, Mr. Lucas, or Colin, if I may, has offered to show us the sights of Gay Paree. His mastery of the language will prove him very valuable. Too flambé right! It's an ill vent that blows no-one any bon. - Merci, madam. Oh, Mr. Lucas, you have the gift of tongues, would you order some lovely food for us? Avec pleasure, madam Garcon, bring a vous what's the menus of this place, and don't spare the flambé bechamel. I could go a steak. How would monsieur like his steak? Ah, just knock off its horns, wipe its arse and bung it on the plate. Lovely, lovely, lovely! Oh, isn't it lovely? I can't wait to show my Paris footage at the Melbourne Creative Leisure Centre. - Yeah. - Hey, Col. - Yeah? I reckon that dinner I put down at lunchtime was a bit on the nose. Got a funny feelin' in me Ned Kelly... I'm gonna cry Ruth! Better do it over the rail, Mon ami. Notice the way the little Frog sheila keeps lookin' at me? Think she'd be in a game of 'Sink the Sausage', no risk! Bazza! Barry McKenzie... It's me, Nerida Breeley! You remember, in the old Bondi West Sunday school days? Nerida Breeley! Cripes, what are you doin' here? I was just a poor innocent Australian come on a trip to London when my work permit ran out. I took up this job so I could save up the fare for a mini trek over to Afghanistan. - Does your mother know you've got a job like this? Cripes, I never thought I'd see the day when a decent, clean-living Australian sheila would sink this low! Nerida Breeley! Don't you realise the bastards who come to opera houses like this are the scum of the earth? Don't come the blue-nose wowser, Baz. Besides, you were never against having a bit of a grope Sunday arvo by the dunny at Shark Beach. Yeah, but that wasn't in front of a dirty great mob of perving Frogs and Deigos! Barry, a girl's got to eat! I'm gonna save you from all this you poor little kid! - Get outta the way, Barry! Your Aunty's in Bondi. Think about your poor brother Craig! And what about Russell, your boyfriend? Slaving his guts out for that block of land, the poor deluded bastard! Hey wait a minute you Froggie! I'm just trying to save this Australian lass! You're a ravin' ratbag, Baz! You wrecked a bloody-good cultural show! You bastards don't give a stuff about Australia's image! I missed the bodyguard by two seconds. I had the bomb right under his seat! How was I to know he would be kicked out of the club? - ...that explosion! Nearly got... - Where have you been, Barry, my lad? - Sorry Aunty. - I've been standing here... Das cultural underground opera house, see... I kill him now and then grab the Queen. Don't be a fool! If you miss and kill Her Majesty you know where the Count is capable of sending us? - No! - Yes...Australia! Jeez Col, how can you stand livin' in this dirty old dump? There's a lot of old buildings and not a decent beach in sight! Strewth! Look at that ruin! Why don't they knock it down and put up some amenities? You know, like garages, bottle shops, a few drive-in Opera Houses? An arty-crafty bloke like you'd be laughin' back in Australia now. The government's shellin' out piles of moolah for any bastard who reckons he can paint pictures, write poems and make fillums! Look at old Paddy. He's a film critic from Sydney. Copped twenty thousand just to come over here and go to the flix! Blood oath! I mean don't let this clapped-out culture grab you ,mate. Back in Oz now we got culture up to our arseholes! It's no good, Baz. Wild shivelles wouldn't drag me back to Oz now. I once was shook on a sheila in Melbourne. - We were gonna be married. - Yeah? Yeah. Col, she says to me: 'I'll bend over backwards to make you happy'. And then I found out she was bending over backwards for a lot of other blokes, including one of me best mates. So I came over to the old Gay Paree...to forget. Mon dieu. I tell ya, Baz, I'd have crawled over half a mile of broken glass just to hear that little sheila piss into an empty jam tin. Strewth Col, did you ever tell her you felt that way about her? G'day, Col. Brought around a bon little fille to meet you, Baz. They reckon she goes off like an alarm clock. If she goes off in here there'll be strife. Me Aunty Edna's in the next room. Allo darling. You 'ave a little gift for Germaine? Col tells me you Australian. A friend of mine is Au pair to an Australian dentist. She say he like it, how do you say, plain and simple... But Germaine not so simple. Yeah, I reckon that. Hey, she's comin'' on a bit strong, isn't she, Col? Takes two to tango, Baz. - You might have to butter her up a bit. Look, Col, I hope I don't cop a rash or something. I remember me dad tellin' me about his mate during the war. Had a naughty with a Deigo tart and the poor bastard's nose dropped off! This lovely mademoiselle is no ordinary tart. - She comes from one of the top families. - Convent educated. - She's RC! RC, AC, DC- the lot! Come on for just for me drongle. I'm in for horse collar! Germaine is cold. You come here, keep her warm. Look, couldn't you come back later? I was supposed to be going out with me Aunty Edna. This Edna is sexy, yeah, like Charmaine? I bet Germaine knows more tricks than this Edna. I reckon you're not wrong there, Germie. Listen, hold on. Hold ya horses! Me nose'll be a right-off at this rate! Aw, stone the crows! Now you've done it! I reckon it's loose already. - Tomorrow morning I'll probably be looking for it among the bed clothes! - What a mug I've been. - Barry? - Barry, what's going on in there dear? - Nothing, Aunty. Look, Germie, you're a colossal lookin' sheila and all that, and to tell you the truth I'm that randy I could root the hair on a barber shop floor, but I promise my Aunty Edna I'd take her to this lecture. Bugger me dead! That sky pilot's a dead ringer for you, Bazza! Barry, Barry, it's Kevin. - Barry, isn't it a small world?! I wonder if he brought Cherylene? Kevin?! Looks like a flamin' pie eater! Gee Bazza, your brother is a sky pilot! No wonder you never let on about him. Pull your head in! I don't think a bloke would skite to his mates - that his only twin brother wears his collar back to front, do you? He's the only one on your side of the family with a modicum of refinement, Barry. Oh, yeah. Look boys, I've still got that snap taken of Barry and Kevin when they were toddlers. - You poofters! Dearly beloved, the Reverend Kevin McKenzie from Australia. He's no stranger to you who have read his wonderful book 'The Coming of Age on Kangaroo Island'. - The Reverend Kevin McKenzie... - Kev, look who's here! Barry! Would you believe? - It's been donkey's years! - G'day Cherylene. Gee it's bonza to see a real, fair-dinkum Australian sheila for a change. Oh Kevin, it's quite a family reunion. Verily, Aunt. God moveth in a mysterious way. The family that prays together stays together. Geez Barry, you're just the same. We heard you'd gone all sophisticated from being in England. Yeah, they reckon me Aussie accent's nearly disappeared. Cherylene, curbest thou thy enthusiasm for my profligate brother if thou willest. Fair suck of the pineapple, Kev. Look at you all dressed up like a pox doctor's clerk! - You haven't changed. - Neither hast thou. - Barrington. - Barrington?! Big sheila! I told you never to call me that, Kev. The others will reckon I'm a shirt lifter! Seest thou drongos later. We're that proud of young Kevin. The bodyguard. - Hopefully I'll be contributing a paper on the modern church. He has yet to accept the consecrated use of marijuana in communion service. Christ would have really dug the gay scene. Have you ever balled another chick, Mrs. Everage? I may be old fashioned, young woman, but lesbianism has always left a nasty taste in my mouth. And without any further ado, I would like to welcome him to this parish seminar on Christ and the Orgasm. dearly beloved, the very Reverend Kevin McKenzie. The very Reverend Kevin McKenzie... - Kevin...McKenzie! Barry, Edna, Kevin's disappeared! They can't find him anywhere. Have you tried looking in the throttling pit? There's no-one in the rest room, Barry. Quite frankly I'm frantic! - The very, very Reverend, Kevi McKenzie! The Bishop sounds worried. Sounds like a ravin' ratbag to me, Aunty. - I've got it Barry- you go on. - Me?! - Come off it Cherylene. - Don't be mad, you can't let the family down. If they think Kevin's shot through, he'll be up the creek with the Bishop of Bondi! You have to do it Barry. You can't let Australia down. Right-o, Aunty. And now here he is, all the way from Sydney, Australia- the Reverend Kevin Menzies Nelson Eddy McKenzie. Thanks Arch. As a sexual counselor, what might your approach be - to a young female parishioner with grave nyphomaniacal tendencies? I reckon that's a tough one. Ah, I suppose I'd take her to the pictures... - buy her a few shandies and then have a crack at puttin' the ferret through the furry hoop. They're loving him, Cheryl. Mr. McKenzie, I'm a priest. I'm also a homosexual. - My gay liberation colleagues in Australia tell me there is employment discrimination against us. - Speaking as a churchman and humanitarian, where would you place me in Australia? I reckon somewhere around Kings Cross in one of them all night dunnies. Good on ya, Rev! You're not a man of the cloth, obviously. Now for the queen. Sir, in your book, 'The Coming of Age on Kangaroo Island', you refer to the local Flying Saucer Society as a bunch of ratbags.

The Australian Embassy? Ah, kangaroo? Waltzing Mathilda. You know, sky pilots are lucky wearing these dog collars. At least they can enjoy a decent chunder without having to tuck their ties in like other bastards. - What's the matter, Cherylene? - Oh he's not here and there's no note. - What are we gonna do now, Barry? - Dunno. The kids at school used to reckon Kev had two dongers. What do you mean? Well, I mean he couldn't have got as silly as that playing with just one, could he? Oh, don't worry, Cherylene. He must have got nervous and shot through like a Bondi Tram! Aw, he'll probably roll up later full as a bull's bum. Oh geez Barry, you're a great comfort to me. You always were a beaut bloke. Oh gee, thanks, Cheryl. You know Barry, when you went away last year before I married Kevin, I didn't know what I was gonna do. I was pretty keen on you too, Cheryl, but just my luck the old ah... Old Kev got up there first. All the blokes reckon I, I used to be creaming me jeans over you just because you had a set of top bollocks like a pair of Mudgee mailbags! Ah, Kevin never paid me compliments like that! He doesn't really know how to talk to a woman. Oh Barry! - Thou dirty dingo! - Kev! Thou shalt not covet thy twin brother's wife! - Kev! - Kev, you'll hurt him! - Oh, Kev! - You're gonna get the hell out of here! Now Kev listen... This way Kev. It's not my fault! Thou seducer! - Kev...Kev... - Thou explain. Stop it. Stop it! Barry, you've gone far enough! It's stupid! You Bible pimp... - It's not my fault. - stop it, Barry! - Barry, get off him. You'll hurt him! - This one's for Dad. - Fight fair you bastard! - That's enough! Barry, talk to me, talk to me, talk to me! The Commo's have got your Aunty Edna! - I'm over here mate, that's Kev. - Who the hell are you? - Foureyes Fenton. Australian Cultural Attaché to Europe. G'day. Listen mate, Kev's just been down at the Embassy, giving us the drum on two foreign-type bastards he saw shoot through with your Aunty Edna. - What would they want with Edna? - We don't know, but something smells. Kev must have opened his lunch. - Listen mate, all I know's your aunty's in more strife than Speed Gordon. We reckon you're not safe in Paris, Barry. Gotta sneak you back to London, mate. - Not that dump again! - I'm afraid they don't want you neither, mate. Under these new British immigration laws, Aussies have gotta have a Pommie work permit! Work? Brits couldn't even spell it! Bloody Pommies wouldn't work on an iron lung. That's for sure, but don't worry mate... - We got a little scheme going with an English businessman and some wogs... - Erm, some tinted people! Guv, where is this mate of yours? I gotta get this shipment over the channel by 8 o'clock. Listen, just hold on another couple of minutes, will ya? I don't do this for money. I only do this illegal immigration thing for humanitarian principles. G'day Foureyes! Sorry I'm late mate. We got caught in a traffic jamb at the Champs-Élysées. Salam, cobber. Abdul McKenzie's the name. Come on mate. I'm not taking that flaming camel. Now listen Barry. we'll be transporting the other side to London. We gotta meet at 2 o'clock sharp. A high level - consultation with the Australian Ambassador. Your Aunty Edna's life could be at stake, Barry! Right-o Foureyes! Right up he they can't get where we come from. What the bleedin' hell we got here?! What are you gonna do for a crust in London, mate? I'm going to get a job in a snake-charming factory. I don't reckon there'll be too many snake charmers in England, mate. How very wonderful. Then there's sure to be a vacancy! You'd make a pretty good little snake charmer yourself. - Do you play the flute? - No! I am studying Kant. same here, but I keep failing the practical. Comfort stop. - Must be the flamin' curry! - This your vehicle, sir? No, left by foot. is that a Colonial twang, sir? Australian are you, sir? This your national costume? - Born in this country, sir? - You gotta be kiddin'! Indeed sir. Passport please, sir. - That your basket, sir. - Yeah, like it's me dirty washing. - Do you have a license for that serpent, sir? - Excuse me sir, look at that. No entry stamp. This man's an illegal immigrant. Well, well. Welcome to England, cobber. We better find you a bit of accommodation. - And bring ya cobra, cobber. - Oh, very good, lad! I like ya clobber, cobber. - Ah, very good. - I'm really chuffed to meet you, cobber. I tried to migrate to your bleedin' country a couple of years ago and got knocked back, didn't I! Well, they're making things a bit tough, aren't they now? You gotta be able to read and write before you can be a shit house attendant. You're gonna be the guest of Mother England for some time, cobbler. Let me outta here! I mean there'd be no flamin' Mother England if it wasn't for Australia! Our fighting men came over here when you Pomms were ready to throw in the towel! Plus all them slimy yellow men would have flattened this dump if it hadn't been for me uncles and their superlative fighting spirit! I mean the game was nearly up for you Pomms, no risk! If it hadn't been for Australia, most of them slant-eyes pricks would have strung every white titty on a pills and gone chockablock with all the nurses and bus-conductresses! Let me outta here you ungrateful Pommie bastards! - He, Barry. - How did you get in here? I'm your great-great-great-great uncle Crowther. I'm here unofficially to give you a helpin' hand. You're a flamin' ghost! Now come off your high horse, Bazza. I'm no apparition what's come to haunt ya. - You know, the Beaks threw me in here... This stinkin' hole, in 1804, and then transported me to Botany Bay. Pull the other one! Mum said there weren't any convicts in our family. Pig's arse there weren't! Here, you wanna get out of here, don't ya, meet your mate and rescue - your Aunty Edna? - My oath I do. Well, take this and scrape around those big, hefty rocks down there. Go on. Strewth! Five years I was in here. Dug that tunnel with me bare hands. - Leads to a sewer. - How come you never escaped yourself, uncle? Oh, I was dead set on scarpering. Gave it a lot of thought. Then one day I was thinkin'- Why not go to Australia? Anything's better than this bleedin' dump! You're right there, Uncle Arthur. There's a bit of a boat down there. See ya in heaven. Hey uncle, what's them letters on your back- P.O.H.M? All us Commies wear this. 'Prisoner of His Majesty'. Pohm. They tell me the word's still being used to describe what's become the lowest form of humanity. Ta ta. How strong with the needle you gave Her majesty? I think we'll be at the castle before she wakes up. That's good. Cripes, it's darker than an Abo's arsehole! Pong! It smells like a lubra's loincloth. Oh, beauty! Strewth, no oars! Now I'm really up shit creek without a paddle! Bugger all changes here mate. It's worse, if anything. - Got me a bob, guv? - Piss off! - Geeze, watch it mate. - Bloody dog crap! Nearly broke me leg on that Alsatian’s visiting card! The Poms can dodge 'em, mate. Just like those tinted islanders walking on hot coals and never getting burnt. Oh, I could hit that in the golden jail like a plate of porridge! Put on a spurt, Baz, the Australian Ambassador's waiting for us. Hey Foureyes, you reckon this outfit's all right for meeting the Ambassador? Don't worry, Baz.

Just turned up this morning. - Look, I won't say we don't try a few swifties to pull the tourists with - all that garbage about that flamin' Opera House. - But this bloke takes the flamin' cake! Oh, what a wonderful, warm welcome Count, especially after such a nightmare of a trip. You know when I filled in that form in London for a surprise package tour I didn't think I'd be in for so many surprises! The Minister of Tourism will do anything in hos power to make your stay a joyous one. It was so sweet of your daughter here to lend me this pretty frock and matching accessories. He name is Clothilde. She's my slave. She will be looking after your every need, your Majesty. Oh, please don't keep calling me your Majesty. Where I come from informality is the keynote. As you wish...Elizabeth. - You mean me Aunty's in some Commo castle with that oily lookin' poofter? I'd like to come in here, if I may, Excellency. Fair enough, sport. Boys, I’d like you to meet Sir Nigel Stewart of the Pommie Foreign Orifice. - G'day. Pleased to meet you. - G'day. - Like a cold one, Sir Nigel? - Thank you, no. Gentlemen, I read this situation as serious. Damn serious. I want to give you some idea of the kind of villain we're up against. Lights. - Erich Count Plasma. Educated Charter House in Cambridge. Brilliant scholar... Friend of the famous. - Sent down for grave robbing. - Flirts openly with Black Magic. - Defected to the Eastern Block. Thereafter maintains a bizarre ménage while head of the Transylvanian Tourist Commission. - Believed to be a practicing vampire. Do you mean he'll be practicing on Aunty Edna?! Well, she could be all right if she doesn't stick her neck out. - Hugo Cretin...a known pervert. - Modeste Imbecile...homicidal maniac. But otherwise quite harmless. Dorothy...Plasma's repulsive Catamite. - Fanatical Socialist and Secretary of the all-powerful - Amalgamated Union of Transylvanian Hunchbacks. - The woman known as Clothide. Apparently Plasma's mistress. - Voluptuous, perverse. Apparently of low intelligence but no sucker. Could be no bastard's giving her a fair go. Kev's creamin' his cassy! Givest thou the drum, Sir Nigel. Is my aunt in danger of sexual molestation? With respect I should say that was highly unlikely. - However, once Plasma realises he is no longer entertaining royalty, he may be after her blood. Excuse me Erich, I wonder if I might put a call through to my husband Norm, in Melbourne? Reverse charges, of course. There is really no need to sustain this elaborate subterfuge in front of me. There is a cross on the line! - I've told you never to use that word! - What? Line? No...cross! My son, Dorothy will advise us when... communication with Buckingham Palace is restored. Make a note Dorothy, the code name for the Duke of Edinburgh is Norm of Melbourne. Norm of Melbourne. A conventional commando raid to rescue Mrs. Everage from plasma's castle would create embarrassing diplomatic repercussions because of the absurd detente between Australia and the Eastern Block. That's for sure. Bloody Reds! However, my top espionage wallers have discovered that Plasma's mountain fastness is open to conducted tourist parties on Sunday afternoons. This is where you come in, McKenzie. - Ah, you too, Prickface. Mr Foureyes, could rustle up a team of young, intelligent, sober Australians? - Well, a team of young Australians? Wadda ya reckon, Barry? No worries mate. We'll smuggle in Scrotum, Paddy, well, the whole gang. Hey Foureyes, here comes that Abo sheila I committed intimacy with in Paris. I hear them tinted lasses don't like it plain and simple, Barry. Yeah, I heard that... I mean you're not wrong there, mate. Watch out matey! Flipping hell! Well, well, well, Mr. McKenzie! So you put your foot in it again, I see. G'day Doc. Strewth, I must have slipped in an egg and Brit broke the leg off a billiard table. I heard you Aussies were well hung but I didn't realise you kept tripping over them! I understood you were en route to Australia, McKenzie. What brings you to London? It's like this Doc... Me twin brother, Kev the Rev bumped in to two Transylvanian ratbags - who sunk the slipper and dumped him in a dirt tip. Then this oily bastard called Count Plasma - from Transylvania, who was chucked outta school for bein' a vampire and then later became - the third man... - well, mistook me Aunty Edna for bein' the Queen, see, and he whipped her off in an ambulance. Well, Sir Nigel reckons that if my aunty lets on that she's not the Queen, a great, dirty big hunchback dwarf named Doris is gonna turn her into a Frankenstein monster. See, you can only get into the haunted house on Sunday, so Foureyes and me, we're gonna round up some - of our mates and take a decko! You're a sick, sick boy, McKenzie. - Here... Take my card. You can pour your heart to me anytime you like. Must have been the flamin' dog crap on me clothes. Turned me stomach. Come on back to my place, Barry a- and you can clean up some. I'll see ya later, Barry. - Great! - Is that all right? - ♪ You think you're ratbag free... ♪ If you shake your family tree... ♪ See the great big ravin' ratbags falling out... - I’m comin' in honey child! Righto. Oh, let me feel for it, man! - Hey, what's on the go, Rhondy? - Screwless! I done told you. Ride on Monty, the harrumph! May your centrspread inject his navy! Oh, give us a break, Rhondy! If me mum sees any of them snaps her veins'll be a right off! Too much soap on it man for our liberated readers. Fantastic! Fantastic, man! Great! Great! Great! Rub yourself down and come on out. - I got somthin' nice! I's here for you! Rhonda? Rhonda? Here I am, Rhonda darling. I reckon I love ya. Shit! Out of my bed, white trash! What's going on in here? I've got a modelling fee for you, man! How many times I told you, Rhonda, - not to bring any of them male model poofters of yours - to our private quarters? Especially the Australians! - They are the biggest and the most BSA poofters of them all! Welcome, Excellency. Right on time. Now your chaps will be taking off from our old wartime airstrip over yonder in exactly twenty-seven minutes. I take it you've briefed with MI5 instructors? No worries. You've told them about the parachute drop into the pine forest? Cripes... Oh jeez... Cri... Look, I reckon it'd be smart if we broke to 'em on the plane. I think you'll find these lads have got plenty of the old Anzac spirit. Ah, capital. Why not ask the lads in for a grog before you go over the top? Shit hey? Come on you blokes, it's a piss up! But apparently that meeting's gone black form, so... - Where's the eats? - Dunny... - The Australian men's in for a drink. - Australian day, eh? - G'day. Why don't you chaps put on some sort of corroboree? Sorry to disappoint ya sport, but we left our nulanula's back in Earl's Court. - Pommie bastard. - Yeah. Do I hear those dulcet Aussie tones? God, I absolutely worship the Dingo lingo. Listen to this jolly fellow. Say something in Australian, cobber. Listen drongo! I wouldn't piss in your ear if your brain was on fire! Glad you could make it, Col. Never reckoned you'd leave the old Paris. Yeah well, when any of mine's in trouble. - I'm always there. - I say... Is it true that all Australians are homosexuals? Mate, that's just a rumour spread by the Australian government to attract Pommie migrants! She has a photograph of her husband, the Prince Philip. I said your suspicions were unfounded you contorted... I tell you she is not the queen! She is frightened of dogs and horses and loves gladioli! Quiet! Can't we discuss this matter quietly like normal, rational human being? Don't they live in a gorgeous little unit, Barry? No worries, Nolene. It's nicer than a naughty on an inner spring mattress. Don't tell me you two are Australians too! God help us! My oath I'm Australian, and proud of it! It's the greatest little humdinger of a country in the world. You poor Poms don't know what you're missing. Beaut sandy beaches, lovely, juicy steaks. Big shiny cars. Millions of drive-in bottle shops, and decent church-going buggers all over the place, and lots of gorgeous, beautiful, clean-livin' sheilas who root like rattlesnakes! To that! Good on ya, Bazza!

Now remember you blokes...and sheilas, the only types that they let into these Commo showplaces is ratbag Australian journos and trade union whingers who have brown-nosed their way into a free overseas trip. - What if the Secret Police question us? - I'll flatten the bastards! No you won't! Now remember, if you're questioned, you're all radical students from Bondi Uni who want to abolish ya tests before you get a chance to fail 'em. You all think that the sun shines out of Starlin's arsehole. - And don't lose them flamin' badges! Bondi Organisation for Radical Education. Hey, what's this me lunch? Hope you put in some nice curried spaghetti and peanut butter sandwiches. That's a parachute, mate, not ya lunch. And don't open it until you're out of the plane. Oh, you're spoiling me, Erich. This is a banquet fit for a queen! - What could be more appropriate your Majesty - for Transylvania's most honoured guest? No formalities Erich, please. I'd like to get to know this little lass. - I must say dear... - A drink before luncheon, sir? - ...sophisticated kind of a way... - You know when I was your age I used to have hair I could sit on. Tell me dear, do you wear your surgical hose over or underneath your body stocking? You know Erich, my nephew Barry would adore this lovely child. and I'm sure that she would admire the Continental, overseas style elegance that he has acquired. He's given his family a lot of heartache, but I've still got a soft spot for him. And what's the old saying... 'Blood is thicker than water'. Yes...it is. What a sweet little tinted person, Erich. He was a gift from our friends in Peking. Oh, I love Pekineses! Perhaps I could take this little one aside later? He could give me a couple of slants on how to grow Bonsai gladdies! Gladys? Who's Gladys? Oh, I love your old-world home, Count. How I'd adore to decorate it in a contemporary Australian-Spanish style. The lord is my shepherd I shall not... Make sure you get those stakes real sharp, fellas! - ...green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. - He restoreth my soul. - He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for His own sake. - Yea though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death - I will fear no evil. For Thou art with me Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. - Thou preparest a table for me before mine enemy. - Thou annoitest my head with oil. What's up, Col? - You look as nervous as a nun in an Op shop. Here, get this down ya! De apelle, Bazz. Merci a vous. - The lord is my shepherd I shall not want... Okay fellas, we're over the target. Get ready for the jump. The best of Australian luck to the lot of youse! - Tell us all right. - Australia's fightin' to go! Hey, Nolene, you're a bit of alright! When we get back would you like to go down to the Red Cross? We could sink a couple of coldies and take in a talkie. - We've got Australia's shitload! - we're goin' hiking ya fool! - Really, truly, Bazza! (WOLF HOWLS) Believe me, I'm not going cruising. Ripper! - These glorious buildings... - built on the site of wasteful and unproductive parkland - and children's playgrounds - are a lasting tribute to the innate artistry of the Transylvanian people, - and a permanent memorial to the unquenchable progressive spirit of the cheerful, resourceful and industrious C-C-Carpathian worker. And so we say - farewell to glorious Transylvania. Just do it, do it, do it! Jewel, jewel... Jewel of this Socialist Block. What a delightful educational film that was, Erich. It just so happens I've got a little home movie here of my own. It's all about Australia. Would it be rude of me to ask Dorothy to run it through her aperture? What a charming thought, dear lady. Run this through your aperture you mishapen moron.. It's a film of one of the royal tours. Welcome to Plasma Castle, pride of the glory of the people's - Republic of Transylvania. - Come on boys. I've got an idea. - Accompany, because at this moment, the Prize Monarch of England - is viewing the table and the light switch. - You will come this way, please. Fashion wise our Australian menfolk - are real trendsetters. They're the envy of Seville Road. - We are now crossing the fabled Bridge of Death... - How nice to leave the hustle and bustle of city life - and try our luck with gay nature - on one of Sydney's world class beaches. - That's Barry. - Bodyguard. - Wonderful young man. - Oh, those beastly sea wasps again! - However, it's not really as bad as it looks. - The majority of carefree holiday makers nibbled by the wasps are only maimed for life. - The cheerful members of Australia's world-famed shark squads - skip nimbly to the tragedy within minutes. - They're trained to give not only pain killing injections - but on the spot amputations to grateful swimmers. Courtyard of Plasma Castle. Scene of so many glorious battles. - Invaders of the castle... - Hey Col, where you off to? Got a lead on me Aunty? No Baz. Follow me, I'm just going off to train Thomas at the Transylvanian terracotta. Have one for me. Col? This is a typical lower income bracket Australian kitchen. Oh, that's the little chemist where my husband gets his films developed. - Your husband? Oh, the Prince? - Yes, the prints. Once we got the wrong prints. - The wrong Prince? - Yes, prints of Wagga Wagga. I didn't know there was a Prince in Wagga Wagga. - Norm took the prints back. - Norm? Ah, the Prince. Yes, the prints. -...has the finest political system in the world. - Excellency...there is an urgent matter. - I shall have to leave you, dear lady. - Comrade Lucas. - Why aren't you in Paris? - I got some info, Count. It had better be good, Comrade Lucas. Why the KGB tolerates an old-fashioned revisionist like yourself never fails to amaze me. You're in dead trouble, Count. - The castle's crawling with Australian agents come to rescue - Mrs. Norm Everage of Melbourne, Australia. - Never heard of her. My only guest is the Queen of England. If Edna Everage is the Queen of England, I'm Prince Philip! You are the Prince? - Listen Plasma... You filled me in properly in Paris. Give me the drum who you was really after. I could have told you - Edna wasn't Betty Britain! She's not the Queen? Just a moment. That nauseous film...that hint of... Colonial accent! I thought I began to detect inconsistencies in her absurd royalist postures. This bird-brained Australian - harpy has tried to dupe me! To abuse my hospitality. This Everage has made a laughing stock out of this Transylvanian's working class! Bazza! What's the matter, Erich? Didn't you like my little film? I, Erich Count Von Plasma, duped by an Australian housewife! What an unexpected honour to see our illustrious, fortunate leader, Erich Count Von Plasma. - Where are you going? - My boots and stockings are hurting me, dear. Geez Col, you saved me life. Leave me alone Baz, I'm done for. I couldn't lie straight in bed. Ever since... Since they put the finger on me back in Australia in the 50s, for bein' a Commo sympathiser, I've been on the run selling Australia short. I was one of those dirty rats who reckoned there were better places on earth than Oz. - And look where it's flamin' got me! You'll be all right Col. We'll get a quack, a specialist. I'm glad it happened this way, Baz. Will you do us a favour? Take me body back to Australia and bury me under an old blue gum tree beside some sleepy billabong. And Baz, if you see any of them long-haired students or Commo Trade Union types, you tell 'em from Col the Frog, that Australia is the greatest little country in the... Poor old Col. He'd give away his arsehole and shit through his ribs. Cripes! - Col's had it. - Yeah... He saved me life. - This way to the great... Right, let's get up and get those dirty Commo vampires! And now for the Grand staircase... Your don't think your acting, your corny impersonation of royalty fooled me for a moment, do you? Oh, you are a silly Count! This is the last time I go on a surprise package tour. - What kind of a place is this? This place dear lady, is one of the most comprehensive blood cellars in Europe. It will be interesting to add a rare Australian vintage to my collection. - I always give a pint to the Red Cross but this is ridiculous! The Auto-vamp, dear lady. A little labour saving contraption of my own. It can suck you dry - whilst I, for example, mow the lawn. Or watch the cup final on TV. Can I get a cup of tea and a bikkie after this? Full bodied. Pleasant aftertaste. Rhesus negative, if I'm not mistaken! I have been searching for years for this vintage and always in vain. But I must leave you, dear lady and deal with your uncouth Colonial friends. Cooee! Repent! Repent! Please mister, gimme a chance! I liked the film Queen Edna showed. I want to be an Australian, now! I want to start a new life, that's for sure! I want to be a Sydney taxi driver, no worries! Stiff cheddar, son! We don't want types like you undermining our wonderful institutions, our unique lifestyle! Crawling like termites in the fabric of our nationhood! - We've got too many cheap lovers as it is! - Blood oath, Alec! I want to be an Australian! I dunno, Alec. Perhaps given half a chance he might have come good in a country like Oz. He might have been an estate agent, an add man, a car dealer... a or a Cultural Attaché like me. Foureyes...you can't win 'em all. Coo-ee! Oh, sorry to disturb you, but I'm looking for Count Plasma. Funny lookin' bloke... Sorta creepy... Red-lined cape and great big teeth! Strewth! Her eyes, Scrotum! don't look into her eyes! No worries. I never look at the mantlepiece when I'm pokin' a vampire! Coo-ee! - Aunty Edna! - Where's that Plasma bastard? - Are you looking for me? - My Colonial fiends. - Let's get him! This is it fellas. Got ya stakes? Shall we drop all this vampire nonsense, gentlemen? Fuck me! You've obviously all been brainwashed by B grade...horror movies. - Surely you don't believe all these crude fables about pointed stakes and lucky charms? do you? You'll be telling me I keep a pet bat... Cooee! As Minister for Tourism and President of the B grade horror movie writer's guild I have personally expelled from this land countless writers who have debased our image in the west with absurd vampire fear. But beware... Australia too has countless dissidents and capitalists lapdogs who are already producing comic strips and films depicting Australia as a nation of crude, insensitive, beer swilling boors, coarse yokels and guzzling hicks! - Pull ya head in ya mug! - Pull ya head in! - What about me Aunty Edna? - Where is she, fangface? - Yeah, where is she? - Tell us ya bastard! - Where is Mrs. Everage? Tell us, Plasma. - Call off these Colonial cretins, Sir Alec.. - Give up, Plasma. - Us Aussies can lick you dirty Reds any day of the week. - We've got the bravest fighting men in the world! - I won't be wasting my next bullets on...cans of that foul, foaming beverage. - You'll never get away with it, Plasma. - My oath he won't. Fan-bloody-tastic, Prickface! - Bloody beauty, mate! - Hey that Foster's fixed him! - Great mate! You really did it! - Coo-ee - Hey fellas, listen to this. - Cooee. Coo-ee! Edna's down there! Mrs. Everage. Come on! Tell that slant-eyed bastard to piss off, Foureyes, all right! Listen mate, I'm flom Australyan Embassy. Pliss off! Coo-ee... You slant-eyed prick! - Tear him the bloody apart! - Go on Bazza! Get him, get him! - Look out! - Aussie poofter! Cop this! Now I kill! Now I kill! Cooee... -Give him between the eyes, Bazza! - Barry! - You heathen Chinese! - You'll get hurt, love! Ah so, ta ,ta, ta! poofter! Hit him in the pearls, mate! - Fight like a man! Slant-eyed prick! Aussie bastard. What you are now witnessing is a real and raging fortresses fighting and defeating the corrupt forces of the western world. - Go plant ya shit! - Follow me. You rotten, mongrel, Commo, poofter bastard! Right, let's go! Strewth! Turn that bloody thing off immediately! - Turn it off! - Can't find the switch, Alec! - Try that green one! - No, that's not it. She's sinkin' fast! You all right, Aunty? Barry! I tell ya, we were knockin' off them vampires like maggots off a chop! Hey, it was great the way you handled that Plasma, mate. Yea verily, Barrington. The foaming article hath its rightful uses. Hey Barry, come and have a look at this! Strewth! I hope they don't sell that in Australia! Geez Baz, you musta really put ya Que on the rack for that Abo sheila! I might have. Hey Barry! Here's something that should interest you possums! Take a gander at this. Hey, it says that they're gonna pay the fares back to Oz, for expatriate artists and intellectuals. - Hey Baz, that's us! - Too flamin' right it is! - You want a trip back home, fellas? - No, not for me. I'm hooked on European culture. I'm gonna stay here for the Munich beer festival. Fair enough mate. Can you fix it for the rest of us, Alec? No probs boys. - Fix it up Foureyes. - Right-o, Alec. Hey listen wait a minute, before you go. I'd like to propose a toast. Col the Frog Lucas. - Oh look, Barry. - I wonder if the Prime Minister himself - will be down there to meet us? - I hope so. I don't reckon he'd miss out on a chance to welcome all us intellectuals back home. He's no mug you know, Aunty. I reckon the PMs that smart he could sell soap to the Pommies! Did you know Barry that the Prime Minister and I once slept together? Ah, come off it Aunty. I don't believe it! Yes Barry, it was at the Sydney Opera House during the second act of War and Peace. Cherylene beloved, I hope that after my exorcism of Erich Count Plasma I might have won a few converts among Barrington's heathen friends. The church can always do with a bit of new blood.
