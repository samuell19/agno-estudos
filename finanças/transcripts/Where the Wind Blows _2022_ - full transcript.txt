All the guards, quick march! The following story spans three decades Squad, halt! We're the storytellers We're part of the story I've trained new cadets for years I always ask them one question: Why did you sign up? I was bullied So you want to prove yourself? Police are only human We can't fly but we can die I don't care if you fly or die Now that you're a cadet, you must obey the rules Sir! Who makes the rules? Someone-not you Ready... Fire! Nam Kong: 100 Lee Keung: 80 That's pure talent You're now a member of the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) Do yourself proud! Sign here Signing in English? Who are you trying to impress? Your name? Nam Kong Rewind Look at this, guys! Look at what we did! Welcome to the August 26th News Report The Hong Kong government failed to extradite Chief Godber after he escaped to the UK on June 8 Hong Kong citizens protested in Victoria Park, petitioning British Prime Minister Edward Heath to extradite Godber to Hong Kong To report corruption, contact the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) office His many properties were purchased under the names of relatives His many properties were purchased under the names of relatives "The HK$500M Sergeant" is no joke - We need a thorough investigation - OK ICAC Former Staff Sgt. Nam Kong returned to Hong Kong yesterday Find him Yes sir Sir Nam Kong is in the conference room This early? I didn't expect you Yes I'm an early riser It's an honor to meet you, Sgt. Nam Kong Likewise, Officer George Lee You're famous for preventing colleagues from getting rich You're a good fit for ICAC You have quite the sense of humor | brought coffee from Italy in honor of the ICAC launch I'll send for more, if you like Smells good When you open for business, you must treat all clients well The air conditioning is a bit too cold for comfort Perhaps it's intentional? How about 23°C? Sergeant Let's cut the small talk I want to discuss something with you What is your opinion on this issue? What is your feeling right now? Corruption in the Hong Kong Police Force is a way of life I mean, it is as natural as going to bed and getting up in the morning and brushing your teeth Two years ago you failed to extradite Godber How did you succeed now? Godber was previously charged under Section 10, but Britain does not have the same provisions We gathered more evidence a few months ago and were able to bring corruption charges... against Godber under Section 4 It's pretty easy to use the word "frame-up”, but I pleaded not guilty ICAC was accused of using underhanded tactics The police can use the same tactics to catch crooks but not the ICAC? ICAC put their lives on the line Mr. Hunt Have you ever involved, in any way, with corruption at all Absolutely not Sir, you're lying Everybody lies That was a white lie A lie is a lie [t has no color, sir You've got Hunt and now Godber What do I get? My men are harassed daily by ICAC You think Hunt volunteered to be your star witness? You think Hunt volunteered to be your star witness? Are you stupid? My wife often tells me: "Don't expect others to understand everything you say" I disagree Some people just play dumb When I was young, I didn't understand why my father made me choose between a gun and a typewriter Now I know How do you see power? What is the secret of power? The secret to power is knowing that others are weaker than you OK? Back in the day British drill instructors wore leather shoes Indian cadets wore leather shoes As for us, Chinese instructors and cadets alike... we only got sneakers Good Lui Lok told me he didn't just want to shine foreigners' shoes he wanted to shine my shoes, too If I don't wear leather shoes, how can I grant his wish? He also said he wanted to shine the shoes of all Chinese cadets Starting today, all Chinese cadets must wear leather shoes In Chinese culture one offers free shoe-shines in order to get ahead Offering everyone a free shoe-shine, however... makes us all equal Hey! Madam do you have a complaint? No, I'm fine You can tell me Treat yourself to tea, sir Take it back This is all I have Take it back Come here On your knees apologize to the officer Down on your knees! Stop it! Kneel down! Give it to me! Thank you, sir Thank you That's your share Take it or everyone else will look bad Lok Refuse all you want, they'll just leave it in your locker Hey! You ran into me Bring him over You're beaten, not because you refused the money but because you're a snob! I didn't refuse the money because I didn't want it I refused because I don't work for scumbags like you Waste him! What's going on here? We're all colleagues! Get him, too! Even cops get beaten up Lok, just take the money When you're young, it's normal to get beaten up for not paying bullies But getting beaten up for refusing money that's just stupid Following the defeats of... the Western Brigade at Staunton Creek, Middle Gap, and Wanchai Governor Mark Young plans to hand over Hong Kong this afternoon Kong We're not going on vacation; we're fleeing the war Pick one of the two It's almost time, sir Hurry! We could be bombed at any time! Get to the air-raid shelters on Chatham Road! "Those deserted shops..." "Are like morgues” "People die there..."

Kuomintang (KMT) General Kot Siu-wong... and his followers relocated to Hong Kong Their Guangzhou headquarters was located at No.14 Po Wah Road hence they were known as the 14Tong As clansmen, you must never collude with government officials Yes, sir Never betray your clansmen Yes, sir Never betray your seniors Yes, sir Or you'll be stabbed three times Sui-hung serve Sgt. Yu some congee You must be Master Kot's son Give him some The world belongs to the young now From now on Lok will take care of things for you Sir it's easy for you to say Are we the scapegoats in your power struggle now? A handshake between cops and criminals? What's the world coming to? Not bad but not as good as the congee from my hometown Sir our food is a little base and coarse I know-and so are your dealings Sit down all of you! Sit down! Let's make a deal: My men will arrest one man each Arrest whoever looks at you wrong For all I cared people said I was too young to fear or acting without thinking ahead I just knew that... I must let the triads know they place Officer Lui Lok was outstanding in this operation He struck a severe blow to the triads Officer Lui Lok was outstanding in this operation He struck a severe blow to the triads Nam Kong Why don't you present the case to the senior officers? The 14Tong is an anti-Communist action group They're mortal enemies of the local triad organizations Fights often ensue In other words, rather like Al Capone? Yes, sir But with or without syphilis? God knows Sources say Nam Kong's father was a lawyer Nam grew up affluent, a St. Joseph's College alum, A sharp shooter His nickname is "Headless" Give me all your bullets Just so you know, I'm not returning any It's just you? Yes, just me Why? It's not like I'm moving house Rumor has it that on that day, I volunteered to capture the bus mogul's attempted abductors in order to get myself a promotion My true intention was to subdue the criminals In the end, was the brave man victorious? No, the wise man was Let's get a drink sometime Why? Want to recruit me? What are you thinking? I'm just interested in a partnership OK, when? Liquor or herbal wine?

The protesters demanded compensation for the damaged flags... a firecracker event and a public apology Negotiations failed I told you just to stage some looting to cut me some slack How did you get the ambassador's wife killed? Beyond your control? What kind of triad boss are you! This is not a simple issue about Hong Kong It's a high political issue Do you understand? Dickhead Any solutions? Any suggestions? Anyone have suggestions? I have an idea I believe a gang of hired thugs... are behind the riots Our riot police have cordoned off Tsim Sha Tsui, Yau Ma Tei and Sham Shui Po But the rioters are using guerilla tactics to hit Kowloon City, To Kwa Wan and Jordan By the time we get there the rioters will be gone Our entire police force is only 6,000 strong We also need to protect the banks, police stations, and government offices We don't have the manpower to handle the rioters Seventy percent of the rioters are triad members Forty percent of them are looting Our priority is to catch... the looters OK We meet again We haven't even had breakfast yet I'd rather have a drink My gallstones have yet to harden I'll send you an invitation Officer Lui, you're lucky to have won... Miss Teat's heart So you know? You just need to clean up this mess before the wedding Any suggestions? We just received our orders: Open fire to suppress the riots if necessary Sure Then we'll follow our orders Do you have a better idea? Do you? You're about to get married A blood bath is inauspicious How do they tell the looters... and the KMT apart? Long live San-min Doctrine... Crazy Chuck Freeze! Police! Search upstairs Arrest them all We're not done searching that side, let's go Stop there ...or you'll die Run? Wanna run? Run, I dare you! Hit him... British troops may intervene soon Then it'll be out of our hands Do you think I should smoke now or not? I'll get you even if it costs me my life - Come help out! - We're not outnumbered or afraid of you! We just received our orders: All officers are free to open fire I understand how you feel We've lost a few colleagues ourselves But our targets are looters, not protesters There's safe passage for you on the backstreet Please cooperate Let us catch the looters first Go home take some rest Come back to protest tomorrow British troops may intervene Then it'll be out of our hands This is a Chinese affair Keep the foreigners out of it! My father and uncles all are KMT I don't want any of you to get hurt Brother What should we do? Sir Is your father KMT? What do you think? During the unrest earlier this year, Officer Lui Lok exhibited great courage and displayed unwavering commitment to suppressing these rioters He is now promoted to the rank of detective in the Tsuen Wan District in the New Territories Nam Kong also displayed outstanding abilities in suppressing the rioters He is now promoted to the rank of senior corporal in Sham Shui Po Congratulations! Thank you, sir! I will do my utmost to assist the detectives in Sham Shui Po to bring order to this chaotic old quarter My sources found out why you got transferred out of Sham Shui Po Deputy Chan issued the order He wanted his henchmen to take control I believe the recent riots and disturbance caused by the triads are headed by the 14Tong This toxic cancer of society must be rooted out Safe travels to Taiwan Take care of your father's funeral arrangements I'll send you condolence money The bride's here Leap over fire and smoke: The bride will bear an heir The bride enters the marital chamber The phoenix and its mate sing in harmony Kneel Uncle Nian, your tea May this household will be filled with prosperity and happiness for generations to come Thank you, Aunt Hunwa Kiss her Lok Thank you, everyone! - Sir - Lok Lok, a small token Congratulations! Cheers! Congratulations! Thank you I knew my husband would invite you Thank you for coming He mentions you often- he admires you Admires me? What's so good about me? What did you say to my wife? I was badmouthing you You'll get drunk at this rate You won't stand in for me? Drink up! One more! He's sober, give him more! - Refill - Drink, drink, drink! Cheers!!! Did you know I was a cop? A cop? You're pretty good for a cop You've been firing bullets all night without knowing who I am? I've set up the meeting I feel bad for you They took credit for your work Sham Shui Po and Tsuen Wan... are worlds apart Tell the seniors it's time to retire to make way for you Why sit on the pot if you're constipated? You may not like the triads, but they're useful when you need some dirty work done Mrs. Lui, talk some sense into him! Women should stay out of men's affairs Bring us more wine I need to hear his full confession They say Lui married a smart lady- they weren't exaggerating Skip the small talk Mr. Kot must know why I am here My husband thinks I'm on a business trip I promise everything stolen from 14Tong will be returned Lui is on the path to greatness If anyone gets in his way, we'll eliminate them Deputy Chan? Tsai Zhen and Kot Sui-hung formed a partnership and did all sorts of things... to help Lui Lok get ahead Those were kind of open secrets Even I got wind of it I told you to take action I didn't tell you to kill people Miss Tsai For triads, taking action means killing people If I didn't do it how could Mr. Lui land his post? It says... Lui Lok never received a formal education He was a shoeshine boy, a paperboy, and a rickshaw coolie But Lui Lok... was probably the last to know The triads have overtaken every district Their turf wars create unending chaos The current system is not working I'll grant a limited number of licenses to opium dens, gambling joints and brothels in our district and eliminate the others Each establishment will pay us a set fee each month Each establishment will pay us a set fee each month That should take care of everyone from the Police Chief... That should take care of everyone from the Police Chief... down to toll guards In short the district sergeant will determine who and how much to charge Now, the rules are... clear and simple Understand? This circle represents our district The triad establishments will be licensed We'll charge a monthly management fee The collection and payout will be centralized We'll be filthy rich! Payout is easy but collecting is tricky You can start by collecting from strip joints and mahjong parlors The monthly take will be easier to handle ...took a red pill out of his bag The maiden swallowed the pill and felt great pleasure She asked the fairy: "What is this pill called?" "Debauchery” Daily collection from drug dens, brothels, and banks will be too much for you to handle They're big money Banks? Gambling houses, idiot! Let the name lottery begin! It's the most profitable game Hongkongers are the most gullible This name lottery proves it The winning names are predetermined No one sees how much money goes into the pot It all comes down to one word- "belief" Miss I'd like Room 517 I'm sorry, sir But it's currently occupied Ask them to leave We'll rent it long term Keep it simple Just break down the key points, Just break down the key points, so it's easy for me to remember Over the last three months, Yau Ma Tet's revenues... ...doubled. Why? It's called a management fee We'll collect from them... only once a month We can't all flock to the lucrative districts Sharing a cake with many people means a smaller slice Where's the good in that? Chaozhou pastries are the best, but they're too small to share Our goal is to make a bigger cake Let's make a big Xiqiao cake But can we have our cake while ignoring the triad problem? What about Her Majesty? Collect reports regularly Make the triads provide an account of all dealers and loan sharks... on the streets Find out who's doing what, where... and for whom With this information we will have power over the triads Put out the news that we have the triad situation under control Better yet, disband the Anti-Triad Unit Then we all look good So the foreigners will have nothing to do? No, they'll be busy ...counting money Thanks to the recently implemented security reforms crime is down Brothels, gambling, and opium dens have been repeatedly raided Armed fights among criminals are at a new low People claim that they're feeling safer on the street I want 100% of cases solved But there will always be some that slip through Find some scapegoats Pay them off Come get your crime tokens! For the To Kwa Wan robbery! For the Sham Shui Po assault! For the Kowloon Tong robbery! Brother Lok, why don't you start a football club? The boys love football! Sure Sai-wing is our best footballer! Yes? You set it up As you wish Nosy You've dabbled in horse racing, movies, publishing You've even written news columns And now football? Do you have a real job? Of course, I do I work for Brother Lok Don't we all? Please don't mind Brother Lok may be less educated, but people refer to... you two as "Lui and Nam never "Nam and Lui" In other words Headless may be educated, but he can learn one thing from Brother Lok- how to make friends When I was small, a fortuneteller told my father that I had many servant girls in a past life, so I'm fated... to be a servant in this life He also warned me against being ambitious It's not easy being a servant girl Keeping a house in order... is no small task Nosy, listen closely After mahjong we'll visit Club Tonnochy No need to bring cash Fat-Bee says there's a new batch of girls Good! Yeah, they all have melon-sized breasts! No way Quit stalling - Impossible! - Pong! Don't tell me... Brother Lok? - Pong - Just pong Yim, trying to lose on purpose? It's a ten-grand game! Did Limpy Ho give you money to buy a sergeant rank? You've become generous Limpy Ho? Yim's cousin? He's great; smart man with guts I have Yim to thank for the introduction 7 Myriads But it takes more than money to be a ranking officer now Damn... I have a winning hand... Hurry up Come on! - 1 Myriad! - I win! - That's the one! - No way! No way! You're so lucky, Brother Lok! Why didn't you intercept the tile? Nam, you could have won You folded with a great hand? No wonder they call you "Headless" I dozed off and missed it "Thirteen Orphans” is the top hand Let's say we both won There's no double-win in Cantonese mahjong You can't make them pay twice Why not? Can't we both win? Are you the master... or a servant girl? Hypocrite! It's just a game! Carry on Everything's fine! Let's play No matter how I look at it I can't call this a winning hand Can you? Son of a bitch! Did I ask you to throw the game? Are you the boss? What? You think you get to decide who wins? It's just a game! OK, OK, it's my fault It's my fault! I deserve to die! What's wrong with you? What's wrong? Don't you know? All these years, I've humiliated myself doing all your dirty work I did it all Instead of thanking me, you just stomp all over me Who told you to lick my boots? How about I make you a sergeant? Are you up to it? Fuck! -Yim... - Don't.. We're all brothers Don't fret Take your winnings Here We each get half Say... Your glasses are broken I think so They're expensive I'm leaving Brother Nam Come drink with us Forget it, my glasses are broken What are you doing? Keep it Brothers, clean up Let's clean up.

Syphilis Why aren't you helping her? How? With what? Do you have money? I want to help them all- but there aren't enough resources The suppliers are inflating the drug prices I can only help the ones likely to survive Mr. Lui Mr. Lui, she's here Your skin is so pale You've got bruises from pole dancing Pity Does it hurt? No Are you sure? I followed Master Zhang to Hong Kong but no one was interested in Peking opera Master owed the smugglers money, so he sent us here I'm slow I fall down a lot Next time you fall, I'll catch you Are you Mary, Helen, or Vivian? I'm Xiao yan, and you? Lui Lok Don't worry, I'll be fine Are we going to have children? Yes, we'll have lots of children You promised... to give me lots of children Yes... I promise Don't leave me again Up all night again? Yes Nosy and Fat-Bee made me play mahjong They kept winning and wouldn't quit Father said... he wants to name our son Son? How does he know? It could be a girl What makes you so certain? Because I want a girl I've already chosen a name Nian-yu Lui Nian-yu Nian-yu I thought you men from Haifeng prefer boys You're still speaking to your father? He's my father He should know if he's having a grandchild When I was young, I was fascinated by high heel shoes By the time I was old enough to wear them they said I was too tall to wear high heels I was so angry If others could wear them why couldn't |7 They said I was headstrong I felt even more alone, especially after my mother passed away Mrs. Lui, you've just had a baby. Shouldn't you be resting at home? Lok wanted to come; I want to keep him company What's taking Nam so long? That's how he is Your father has passed away Why didn't you visit him on his deathbed? Who wants to see a dying man? Do you? You asked me why I didn't go see him one last time I was afraid if I went, it really would be the last time When Japan invaded Hong Kong, my parents and I fled to the mainland I met a Japanese officer there His name was Tokai, Tokai-san I was 20 years old at the time You want this? You like it? He often had me play piano in the barracks He said he liked the piano The Japanese soldiers often saw us together They thought we were friends, so they treated me well Salute What did you mean to him? A friend? I don't know There's a lot I don't remember Or maybe I just don't want to One day he took me to a deserted building Inside I saw my father crouching over my mother My mother was lying on the ground, covered in blood He gave me a handgun Kill him and follow me Be my son We'll go to Japan after the war You won't die You'll have food I remember that my father grabbed my hand and told me to pull the trigger Shoot! Shoot me! Shoot me! Without thinking... I turned around and shot Tokai I thought I was done for Stand down! It's an order... from your superior When we left, I didn't dare look back at him Why didn't you shoot me? You almost got yourself killed! The events of that day were like some strange play rehearsal No matter how many times the scene plays over in my mind I still can't watch- especially the part where my mother died We didn't even say goodbye The scene was pathetic... absurd You seldom smile except when you apply rouge When we were little, the troupe master always said: "Only dead people wear rouge without smiling" I like seeing your smile I'll buy you more rouge You've had enough Stop nagging! I'm drinking because I'm happy! I'm getting married to make you happy Sorry for leaving early How are you? Same old same old Pa I miss you I'm asking, what do you plan to do next? There is no such thing You know how it is in our family We'd never replace a dead dog or a resigned servant That's not what I'm saying Just take this: Stop doubting yourself so much The Police will establish two posts for Detective Staff Sergeant Class One They shall lead the CID, give direct orders, and execute unified transfers and commands Yau Ma Tei and Mongkok are both yours Don't let me down, OK? Ready? Wait Bee, switch places Ready? 3, 2, 1 I appreciate your continued support Cheers Everyone here gets a share! Police babes!

I know you deal drugs to provide for your military government They get the whole country You get the big contracts for building railroads and ports That's a good deal We can't do that, damn it Hong Kong was conceded to the British because of opium Need I say more? You know people give you a name "Hongkonger Lo Hsing-han" Mr. Yim A small token Bastard! I don't know who the heck is Lo Hsing-han You tell him My name is Ng Cheuk-ho "Limpy Ho" Not enough?

No This medicine will take care of it Trust me With both Nam and Lok behind him Limpy Ho has taken over... all the prime districts The other three clans are powerless He even took over my turf You may not be able to intervene, but you must at least warn Lok... about Nam Kong Uncle Nian Take refuge in Wanchai for now I'll resolve this somehow Brother Ho! Sister! It's been a long time Sit, sit, sit! Sister Talk to my wife If I don't play with my children, they'll be upset Brother Ho is such a doting father Have some tea Sister, I've been learning Shanghainese Don't laugh at me Sister What do you think of me? What do I think of you? Your reputation and conduct are beyond reproach Who are we to judge you? It seems you do know your place I encouraged Ho to be ambitious, I never asked him to cross the line What line? A line you drew? We will continue to pay Chief Lui's fee- not a penny less but don't interfere with our business Sister, Why work so hard? Chief Lui doesn't acknowledge your work behind the scenes So why bother? Don't meddle in our family affairs As for Kot Sui-hung, I can't keep him at bay much longer Who's afraid of that bastard? Now that you mention it- Kot is rumored to be your lover Even if I keep quiet, Chief Lui will find out eventually Men like him cheat all the time, but if he finds out that his wife cheated on him, your family will be ruined If I hear a whisper of such a rumor again even if you don't breathe one word I'll hold you responsible! Sister, my Shanghainese is so poor! You spoke too quickly for me to understand Lok shouldn't you save the best cut for your own men? Tell Uncle Nian to retire His wealth should last for generations Such lofty talk! Isn't Limpy Ho selling drugs too? That's Limpy Ho's business This is Hong Kong- the strongest stay on top! - Red Pocket here! - Thank you, Sister Enjoy yourself! Thank you Brother Ho Come watch the show! Trash the place!

You instructed her doctor to prescribe... abortion drugs It left her in such pain, she took opium incessantly Xiao yan It hurts... I'm still hurting I need to make it stop Back off! There are obstacles in your path But you don't care- you don't even know And Xiao yan? Whose path did she block? Everyone respects you You're Lui Lok's only true wife What more do you want? I checked Xiaoyan's background The word "yu" never came up You can barely read, but you know the words "Nian-yu"? I gave birth to a boy, not a girl... but you still insisted on that name? I thought I could give you what she couldn't I'm sorry... I've lost our baby You may have killed Xiao yan, but you won't kill Xiao yu! I'm glad... we met The doctor lied to me He said no harm would come to the mother On that day the soldiers threw me into prison - Here - the Superior Salute!

Watch out! Cease fire! Cease fire! Have some Mid-autumn Festival dumplings Thank you Have you forgotten why we set up the rules? To control the triads so that everyone can profit If you continue causing trouble, I'll fight to the end I haven't forgotten- you have The triads have taken over every district Their turf wars have created chaos The system is not working See for yourself Do they have to live in squalor just because they're poor? In the past, the triads were to blame Now the police are responsible too To them, nothing has changed You want to control the triads? They're thriving better than ever I used to think I was smarter than you Later I realized I really was smarter I knew your system would fail But you got everyone to play along I couldn't just walk away I never wanted to compete with you You were making a big mess, I just wanted to fix it But I've had it Smart people... also make mistakes... but they know when to quit Back when you rejected me, you said I over thought things You preferred a simpler man I used to admire your husband He was simple and direct But I never imagined you would do all that dirty work just to protect his ego It got me wondering how far... were you willing to go? One night a few years ago, After playing Mahjong with you, Cora came home... and threw away the perfume I gave her She asked me what was wrong with her I didn't know what to say She later confessed... her only crime in life was that... she wasn't you I'm sorry I keep stepping on your toes It's fine Go home, it's late Did you ever suspect me of hiring that hitman? Never Not even out of jealousy? On the contrary- I suspected what you did had nothing to do with Lok It was all for me? "You smiled and my heart's no longer mine" "It keeps on repeating your lovely name" "Even when we are far apart” "Oh what have you done to my heart" Goodbye Haircut, please Mind waiting? No Please sit Carry on I'll pay for him OK Why? Bribing me? Would I dare? You have an army of henchmen All my men... defected to your side Take some back I was always bad at "human resources” I was always bad at "human resources” I'll just help you reestablish order then you can take it from there Don't use English "Human resources" - the art of misinformation ...your specialty In 1967, anti-British sentiment was on the rise, Many workers and students rebelled violently against the colonial rule Cars were set alight in the street; bombs threats were omnipresent plunging the city into a crisis that lasted 7 months To rebuild social and political trust the government adopted a new stance against endemic corruption Justice of the Peace Jason told me that... the British government just passed a bill They're sending an anti-corruption commissioner to Hong Kong I'm worried I wish to make an announcement I'm retiring I'm immigrating to Canada with my family Why don't you all join us? We can go into business together There are five of us- let's call the company "Five Dragons" What part of you resembles a dragon? Maybe your claws? I'm serious The British are not playing games this time Haven't we seen it all before? The British... don't know how to deal with the Chinese They always resort to threats Let's wait and see Business is booming out there Even if we wanted to leave, our men wouldn't let us I'm not leaving; it's the same everywhere Not at all Hong Kong is unique All kinds of people end up here It's a place where anything can happen if you put your mind to it I'm used to the smells of Hong Kong I'll be sorry if I can't taste its street food anymore Inside the brightly lit Lion Rock Tunnel, it's easy to forget that we're traveling through a mountain On December 6, 1972 a fire broke out at 7 a.m. at White House Hotel on Wanchai Road The entire hotel was reduced to a pile of rubble Welcome, sir A burnt out ruin- what's there to see? I've never been inside this place They say it was a hangout for elite members of the police force The elite? The police? They're just men They can't fly but they can die Are you a policeman? I'm a... civil servant INTERPOL issued Red Notices for the arrest of senior officers embroiled in corruption Some say it's customary... for officers to accept cash gifts in Chinese culture It's not corruption; any comment? You are correct Such transactions are customary among... friends and relatives But for civil servants, it's corruption- pure and simple Good morning, gentlemen I'm sure you're all aware of the political circumstances occurring outside of this room Now I'm concerned that this crisis may affect our ability to rule the colony Now I'm concerned that this crisis may affect our ability to rule the colony So what I need is a proposal Mr. Governor I don't have any suggestions yet, but... I would like to ask the Commissioner of Police some questions, if I may May 17? It's fine I took a tram here today, and I haven't been taking the tram for a long time, actually Because my car was smashed by demonstrators yesterday, right here, outside Because my car was smashed by demonstrators yesterday, right here, outside Do you know who those people are? They're Royal Hong Kong Policemen They're your men then, right? That's correct May I ask what their duty is? To uphold the law and order And what are they doing now? They're just expressing their grievances Expressing their grievances by smashing the door of ICAC? By purposely breaking the law? Governor, under the circumstances, I hope you'll request the police to do something After all, this is their mess This is an emergency Commissioner If I may, it is rather difficult to carry out these arrests After all, they are our colleagues You know they are facing a period of great hardship Of course We fully understand the brotherhood among you all Some have already lost their lives So to save the embarrassment, not only on your part, Governor I feel that you might consider sending forces to resolve the crisis at a suitable time Would the British forces in Hong Kong support the colony? No, sir, we oppose this proposal It is completely wrongheaded Even if we carry out the mission without using weapons, the relationship between the British Army and the Royal Hong Kong Police Force is certain to suffer So it's brotherhood again So seeing as the military nor the police are prepared to solve this problem, it leaves me with just one solution- and this will cause some embarrassment for some members in this room... and God knows, myself, a lot of pain My staff and I have sat down, and we have come up with a very bold proposal We propose an amnesty Any corrupt act which occurred before a certain date will not be prosecuted Sir Murray just warned us that the crisis outside will strike a major blow in colonial rule Maybe he's correct... I think he is correct Because to you we are just a colony- that's what we are But I must admit that our work in ICAC has always been painful and shitty! We have hundreds of letters every day crying out for help- people stifled by corruption, right now, right here! So if... we grant an amnesty now, I suppose all departments will be happy, and they'll go along fine, when your tour of duty is over, you all go back to United Kingdom, and... What about me? And the four million people who have to carry on living in this colony? What about them? What about them? What choice have we got? We don't want to live in a city where we'll have to bribe a fireman to put out a fire in your house Right? As the saying goes "Money makes water flow; No money, no show" Right? We don't want to live in a city where you have to bribe an ambulance crew to take your sick mother to the hospital This is not what the Hong Kong people want I remember Abraham Lincoln once said: "I don't know who my grandfather was, but I am most concerned about what my grandson will be" Likewise, I am most concerned about what kind of a city my son and my grandsons will live in Gentlemen, the so-called crisis outside right now is about the integrity of our people It's the key foundation of the future of Hong Kong It's the key foundation in building a clean and beautiful city Governor, I suppose that is all I want to say- Governor, I suppose that is all I want to say- except... I hope... with all my heart... you'll seriously reconsider... the amnesty I wonder what will become of Hong Kong Corruption-free, I hope Is that possible? Thanks Regardless I hope Hong Kong's rule of law will not disappear I may as well tell you I had goose noodle soup on the house several times It was wrong So I paid one day and my colleagues went berserk Soon, I got transferred to the Marine Region Hong Kong's problem is not that bowl of noodle soup Hong Kong's problem is whether we'll produce a decent policeman one day... someone who will proudly pay for his goose noodle soup out of his own pocket I announce a new policy with regard to ICAC operations Have a good day, Sir As from now, the ICAC will not normally act on complaints or evidence related to of fences committed before January 1, 1977 or evidence related to of fences committed before January 1, 1977 I'm leaving the police force for good Your worries will be over But you love Hong Kong Yes But you're all I have You also have two brats How could you forget? They're God-given- You're who I chose So when do I get to choose? How about this time? Would you choose Canada, Taiwan, or Thailand? Thailand I won't go to Canada I don't want to share my husband Let's just live; we're married, after all We'll rely on each other for the rest of our lives I'm grateful that I met you Really? Good Rest if you're tired You should eat more You're too skinny Really? Do you think humans are born actors? Look at him He's not even two... still got that baby smell When he plays and falls, he picks himself up without a fuss But if his mother is near, he pretends to fall again and cry, so convincingly His emotions are real Have we all been acting our entire lives? I think so Those able to fool even themselves are truly gifted Then again... don't dwell on such thoughts We only live once Just follow your heart Cheers! After I die, probably no one will tell this story again Everything disappears eventually We just become characters in some other story How that is told... no longer concerns us The Taipei District Court passed the verdict on Chen Shui-bian's corruption trial last Friday Chen was sentenced to life in prison, fined NT$200M and permanently... banned from running for office for embezzlement, bribery and money laundering Many things happen in a lifetime What we remember tends to fall into two categories: things worth remembering and things we'd rather not remember... but can't forget
