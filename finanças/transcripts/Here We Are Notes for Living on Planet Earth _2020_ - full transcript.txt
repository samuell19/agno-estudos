[woman narrating] Here, in the vastnessof the cosmos, sits a solar system. If we look closely enough,just past Mars and next to the moon, we can see a small blue planetfloating in space. This is Earth. Here we are. [man] Okay. Close your eyes. [woman] I'm holding a baby,I'm not closing my eyes. Oh, right. [chuckles] Sorry. Okay. Come in. Okay. And watch this. [gasps] No way! Did you make this? Yes. Yes, I did. And your mom helped. It's all so sweet. Really. We used to be a family of two. Now look at us. [man] Mmm. [siren wailing in distance] [trunk horn honks] Are you all right? It's so much bigger. What? The Earth. It's so much bigger than that, and a million times more complicated. If Finn is gonna navigate this planet,he'll need to know, well, everything. Which means we have toteach him everything we know and everything we don't know. But how do we do that? I don't even know where to start. Oh, I'm so lost. All right. Breathe... and sit down. Look, this is new for both of us,but we'll figure it out. It's like my mom always said,"If you're feeling lost, just start with what you know,then take it one thing at a time." Suddenly,I feel like I don't know very much at all. Come here. You know at least one thing: We have a perfect little baby. Yeah. I guess so. Um, why don't you get some sleep.We need a little father-son time. Okay. Oh, hello. I'm your dad. We met earlier at the hospital. Um... Let me give you the tour. Here we are. Planet Earth. Yeah, it's pretty big out there. Maybe, um-- Maybe let's startwith the easy stuff, like this apartment. It's where you live with me and your mom. What do you think? It's nice, isn't it? And here's where we eat. Here's where we keep the food cold. And here's where we keep the food hot. Yeah. Someday I'll make breakfast for youwith this pan. Daddy's very good at pancakes. Here's where we do bath time. And here's where we'll do bath timewhen you're older. Here's where you'll sleep and wake up. Oh, and dream. These are called books. They're wonderful. You'll wanna come back herewhen you can read. I know you can't speak yet, and I'm sure your headmust be filled with questions, but be patient. You'll learn how to use words soon enough, and then you'll use them forever. Now then, let's see. Eight planets revolve around the sun. Saturn's rings are made of dustrock and ice. The world's tallest volcanois Mauna Kea in Hawaii. The octopus is consideredthe most intelligent of all invertebrates. The blue whale is the largest animalknown to have ever existed. Polaris is also known as the North Star. The incandescent lightbulbuses far more... [continues, indistinct] [clock ticking] [elephant trumpets] [donkey brays] [alarm ringing] Finn, turn it off. What? Off! But I wanna see how it works! -What?-What? -I wanna see how---[alarm stops] I wanna see how it works. Time for breakfast, hon. Oh, great. Give it time. You only checked yesterday. So, this clock is really cool. There's a spring,and it presses against this-- Incredibly loud alarm clock? [chuckling] Dad! No, this other thing. And when the hand reaches the right place,it sets off the spring and-- I think we got it, thanks. But here's a question for you:Why do we have clocks in the first place? To tell time. [chuckles]But why do we have to tell time? So... um, so people can... I don't know. Because time is precious. So maybe the better we organize our timeinto hours, into minutes, into seconds, the better we can spend our time. Look, it's great that you want to knowhow the alarm clock works, but sometimes you need to step backand wonder why it works. Try to see the big picture. How do you both know everything? Whoa! Earth pancakes? [Dad] For Earth Day. [Mom] Mmm. Not too bad at all. The countriesare all in the right places, yes? Well, I wouldn't chart a courseby them or anything. [chuckles] Oh, did you pack the lunchfor the park? We're going to the park? For Earth Day, remember? Isn't the park nearThe Museum of Everything? Yeah, I think it is. Okay. And yes. Lunch is packed, and the forecast has changed,so it looks like sunny skies. Can we have a family meeting? Yes, we can. Great. I propose that we goto The Museum of Everything today. It's Earth Day,and Earth is part of everything. So the museum would be perfect. Plus, there's a rocketry exhibit, whichprobably has my top five favorite rockets, and plenty of other space stuff, like the Milky Way and Sputnik,and, you know, space things. You know that nobody loves museumsmore than I do, but today is Earth Day. We should be enjoying the planet outside. And also, the museum gift shopprobably has telescopes. And if I had one, I could seemy top five favorite constellations. Which are Scorpius, Draco-- Buddy, we're going outside. But the museum is outside. It's outside this apartment building. That counts. [chuckling] No, it doesn't. That's a clever argument, but no. But the spaceships... [Mom] You can come back to outer spacewhen we get home. -Hello.-Hi. -Morning.-Hi. [Dad] Whoa, Sumiko, that's a cool outfit. Oh, thank you. And more geographically accuratethan your pancakes. -Long story. [chuckles]-[chuckles] So, where are you headed today? [Dad] Oh, you know,just a little trip to the park. [Sumiko's dad] Us too, but a bit later. Maybe we'll see you there. -Bye.-Bye-bye. Bye. Right then. [bicycle bell rings] [Dad] Hold up there, Finn. Look. The Museum of Everything. Can we go? Please? Come on now. Not today. [chuckling] Come on. There's a lot of fresh air out therewe need to breathe, and plenty of grass to picnic in and birds and squirrels, and butterfliesto watch and trees to climb. [Finn] Yay. Okay. So, I just want to say, it's not too lateto go to The Museum of Everything. Seriously? Do you know what we can learn aboutin The Museum of Everything? Earth. It's perfect. Ow. I think the parkis telling you to stay outside. [chuckles] Agreed. Let's go. I can't win. Whoo! Hey, Dad, how much fasterdoes a rocket go than our bikes? Uh, well, we're probably going,I don't know, 15 kilometers an hour You know what,we can figure this all out later. For today, let's just keep our thoughtshere on Earth. Keep her steady, keep her-- Yes. Great. [laughs] Hey, Finn. Sure you don't want to join us? Yeah, come on, buddy,the wind is just right. It's easy, it's just-- [shouts] [chuckles] [Mom] Nice. There you go. Look at that. I mean, it's better thansitting on a stump, right? But I like sitting. Then I have an idea. [duck quacks] Maybe I don't like sitting. [chuckles] [sighs] Hello, fish. Hello! [man] Uh, no. "You are here." Hmm... Ah. This is great. What you thinking about, Finn?You seem distracted. I found a really cool bike trailon the map. And after lunch,we should all go for a ride on our bikes. -Um...-Uh-huh. And along the way, we can look at nature and think about how great the Earth isbecause it's Earth Day. Good idea, right? Okay. Cool trail. Look at those trees! I know. Nature is so beautiful. [pants] Oh, wow. The Museum of Everything. [panting] I'm so, so surprised. Yeah, what a surprise. Since we're here, I don't know,maybe we could go to the museum? He totally tricked us. You gotta hand it to him,the kid has persistence. And ingenuity. Part of me is really proud. Well, I think he won this round. Okay, shall we? Ah-ha, yes! Hmm. Come on! Hi. All right, bud. So you got your way.We're here at the museum. But if you're gonna be here,you should really learn something. Let's see, let's see.Where should we start? Finn. [Finn] Over here! [recorded dinosaur groan] Ankylosaurus, Carnotaurus, Diplodocus,Apatosaurus, and Spinosaurus. "The Diplodocus is related to--" What? He was just here. Come on! [dinosaur groans] [beeps] [heartbeat] What's that? [Mom] That is you on the inside. Here's my brain for thinking, my lungs for breathing, my heart pumps my blood... and my bones hold it all together. Yep. And there's a lot to look after,so look after it. Most bits don't grow back. What about my hairand my toenails and my fingernails? You're right. Those do grow back. Very clever. [xylophone dings] Hang on. [sighs] I was enjoying that. All right! Liftoff in five,four, three, two... one? Oh, hey, I'm so sorry, but we're full up, and this exhibit is now closedfor the rest of the day. Aw. No! Never mind, Finn. Maybe there's something else to see. [Finn] Oh! Oh, let's check this out. This looks cool. Wow! It's so big. [echoes] Is it broken? I think it might be out of service. Wait a second. Oh. Hello? Okay. [narrator] Well, hello. [Dad] Oh! Hang on. [Finn] Whoa. [narrator] Welcome to this planet. We call it Earth. It is the big globe floating in spaceon which we live. We're glad you found us,as space is very big. There is much to see and do here on Earth,so let's get started with a quick tour. The planet is basically made up of-- Oh. What's-- Oh. Was that supposed to happen? Oh, I guess the voice is broken. Can you do it? Um, sure. Uh, the Earth is basically madeof two parts: land and sea. And, um... First, let's talk about the land. We know lots about it. The desert is dry and hot. The plains are flat. The hills are bumpy. The tops of volcanoes can be very hot... Wow! ...while the tops of mountainscan be very cold. And now we're above the sea,which is full of wonderful things. It goes nearly seven miles deep. Is that true? Yeah. The, uh-- Pretty sure. The-- The "Mariana Trench" in the Pacific. [whispers] It says it right here. Look. Whoa, do you see that? [gasps] Wow. Huh? Wow. Whoa! No way! [laughs] Look at that. [Dad] Ooh. Okay. The sea has creaturesof all shapes and sizes. From the tiny seahorseto the, uh, to the... [Mom] Giant octopus? [Dad] Yes! Octopus. Good. Ooh. The bottom of the sea is very dark, but luckily many kinds of fish producetheir own light so they can see. It looks awesome! [Mom] Okay. There's also the sky. Though, that can get pretty complicated. This looks like, um, Earth's atmosphere. [Dad] And, uh... And, uh, this, uh, Stratos-thingy. Uh... [narrator] The atmosphere is the layerof gases, which we call air, that surrounds the Earth. Oh, thank goodness. She's back. You were good. Thanks. The tiniest change in the atmospherecan have a huge effect on our weather and on our lives, producing rain,wind, snow, fog and more. When we take a bigger step back, we can see that the moonspins around us here on Earth, while the Earth spins around the sun. And in the very far distance,almost six trillion miles away, we can see stars, bright, burning balls of gasthat dot the sky on a clear night. Whoa. But closer to home,down here on our planet, there are people. People come in many shapes,sizes and colors. We may all look different,act different, sound different, but don't be fooled, we are all people,and we all share the Earth. There are animals too. They come in even more shapes,sizes and colors. They can't speak to us, though that'sno reason not to be nice to them. There you go. Things can sometimesmove slowly here on Earth. More often though, they move quickly,so use your time well. Because time is precious. Though we have come a long way,there is plenty left for you to do. You will figure lots of things outfor yourself. Just remember to leave notesfor everybody else. Well, that is planet Earth. Make sure you look after it,as it's all we've got. That was epic. Did you like it, hon? For the first time in his life,he's speechless. Can we have a family meeting? [Mom] Um, sure. I propose we go back to the park,like, right now. [Dad] Really? Yeah. I mean, the museum is really cool, but we should be at the park,especially today. -[bicycle bell rings]-And off he goes again. Hello, trees. Hello, lake. Hello, fish. [birds tweeting] Hello, birds. [chuckles] Hey, butterflies. [chuckles] Whew. You know, if you count the rings,you can find out how old it is. Oh, yeah! One, two, three, four,five, six, seven, eight... ...forty-one, 142, 143. [sighs] A hundred forty-three rings. That means this tree was 143 years old. Whoa! That's older than Grandma! [chuckling] That's-- Yes.That's older than Grandma's grandma. -[chuckles]-[sighs] The clouds are beautiful today. Hmm. Is that onean octopus riding a dolphin? [Dad] No, it's more likea car full of balloons. Ah, very nice. Oh, now it's just a bowlof mashed potatoes. So, what do you see up there? Hey, Finn. You okay? So to this bug, I must look really big. Yeah. The way you look to that insectis probably similar to the way... that building looks to you. It's so big. Whoa. That's really big. Uh-oh. Well, it was fun while it lasted. Come on. Let's get home. [ship horn blows] [car horns honks] You've been pretty quiet, Finn. What's up? I-- Well, you know the bug at the park? [alarm rings] What were you gonna say, hon? [Dad] Oh, great... What's happening? Looks like the power's out.Must've been the storm. It's nothing to worry about. I have an idea. We were thinkingwe might go upstairs on the roof. With the power out,the stars will be really bright. Yeah, okay. Uh, you two, um-- You go ahead. I'll be up soon. Huh. It's pretty. Yes, it is. So... the telescope you wanted? We were saving it for your birthday, but we're giving it to you right now. No way! Yes way! It's a present for Earth Day. Oh. Thank you. All right.I'll leave you for some father-son time. I'm gonna go check on the neighbors. Oh. Right, then. Hmm. All right. I'm pretty sure this one is Scorpius,your favorite constellation. All right, what's going on? You've been quietever since we were at the park. Well, you know how Mom alwayssays to look at the big picture? Sure. Well, at the museum,and then later at the park, I felt like I was starting to seethe big picture. And... It was too big? Yeah. And I always wantedto know everything, you know? Oh, I know. And now, it's like-- It's like, the world is so hugethat no matter how much I learn, it'll never be enough. I feel like how that bug at the parkmust've felt when it was looking up at me. Well, it sounds like you feel-- Lost. Hey, come here. Finn, I completely understand. It can be scaryto think about how big the world is. But sometimes,if you look at it the right way, the world can be much smallerthan you think. You know what Mom once told me? "When you're lost,just start with what you know." You know where the Big Dipper is? Sure. Right there. Exactly. Well, those two stars at the end there,they point directly at... [Finn] The North Star. Right. Polaris. So... So that means you can always find northin the night sky. It's always there, wherever you are. And if you know where north is, you can start to find your way homeand you won't be so lost. Dad, does everyone get lost? Yes, they do. At some point,every single person gets lost. Then we should show them allwhere the North Star is. [chuckles] Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that's a good start,but it's a little more complicated. I'd say, just treat everyonewith kindness and respect. And then you can help peoplefeel a little less lost. And listen, if you ever need to knowanything else, just ask. I won't be far away.And when I'm not there, you can always ask someone else. -Hi.-Bonsoir. -Hey, there.-Hola. -Konnichiwa.-Privet. -Hi.-Shalom. You're never alone on Earth. [Dad] Look. [Finn] Wow. [cheers] That's better. Is that your telescope? Uh, yeah. You wanna take a look? Yeah! So that's Scorpius. It looks like a-- Scorpion! Exactly! It's my favorite thing in space. Actually, wait. No, it isn't. What is? Earth.Earth is my favorite thing in space. [narrator] Here we are on Earth. When you travel far enoughaway from Earth, one thing becomes clear: This planet, alone in the cosmos,is the place where people live. And live we do. Life on Earth is a wonderful thing. It looks big,but there are lots of us on here. Seven and a half billion at last count,with more showing up every day. Even so,there is still enough for everyone, if we all share a little. So please be kind. Of course, there is so much more for youto learn about living on planet Earth. But for now, these are the thingswe think you need to know.
