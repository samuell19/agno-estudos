It's nothing you did or didn't do. Believe me, the last thing I want... is to be letting you go like this. It's just that it's a rough time for everyone. People get scared. They get scared and they pull out their money. Well, did he say something about me? Is that what this is all about? No, he didn't give a reason. Can somebody tell me... just exactly how the fuck something like this happens? - Language. - Yeah, Jesus. Shit, man, take it easy. Don't tell me to take it easy, Todd. This isn't happening to you. It's happening to me. I'm sorry, but what's done is done. What are you saying to me? I'm saying what's done is done. Mom! Don't say anything. I just need you to come over here... right away. Hello? No one is available to take your call. Please leave a message after the tone. Kershe? Yeah, back here. Oh good, it's you. It's nice to see you, Cole. The door was open and I... Yeah yeah, good. Come. Come on in. Sorry. I don't have any clothes on. Everything has just become such a goddamn mess lately. And I never have been very good at housekeeping. - Kershe, put the gun down. - I'm not finished with it. But I don't want you to worry about that, Cole. This is strictly a family affair. You know? I'm gonna call somebody. No no no, don't. Can we just... Can we just sit here Together for a minute... You and me? And... you know what my problem is, Cole? I always tried to do everything myself... never wanted any help from anybody. I thought that made me strong, But I've been a very weak man, Cole... very weak. The truth is, the only real strength... is knowing you can't do it alone. So I really want to thank you, because I don't think I could have done this by myself. Anyway, it's getting late... and I know you've... you've got things to do, so... so... away we go. I've been in this... This bin... for the last 30 days. I'm happy as hell to be getting out of here. That's for sure. Excited to get back with my family, pick up right where we left off. And you feel that you're ready for that? Ready as I'll ever be. It's true you've made some pretty significant progress. And we've been talking a lot about... how he plans on staying busy out there. Out there? Christ, you make it sound... like I am parachuting behind enemy lines. Do you expect to find many enemies when you leave here? No, that's... That's not what I meant. I... I have a job lined up. Are you at all concerned about your ability To manage the hallucinations? They're hallucinations. That means they're not real, so no problemo. I'll take my meds. I promise, okay? Okay? Jennifer, I'm seeing something going on for you right now. Do you want to tell us about it? It's... it's been... it's just been a lot. And I don't know, I guess I just don't feel very comfortable with you. Say that to him. I'm sorry, Am I missing something here? It's... It's just... I'm sorry, I... I don't feel safe with you anymore. What? You've just... You're not... I just... I think you need more help. Given the particulars of your condition, In addition to the added stress Of a recent trauma, we believe that the work you've done with us... is only the beginning of what will be... a considerably longer process of rehabilitation. How much longer? We're recommending that you undergo an additional 60 days. At $1000 a day. The cost of treatment is the cost of treatment. The question is, are you prepared... to pay the price of leaving before you are ready? - It's not gonna happen. - As you both know, legally we can't keep you here. This is merely our attempt to do everything we can... to protect your well-being and the well-being of your family. My family is fine. Nothing is gonna happen. It's not gonna happen. Today's the big day, huh? Huh. Yes. Yes, it is. Oh, and these are for you as well. Use only as directed on the label. No mixing with alcohol. Right. You need me to call you a cab? No, that's okay. My wife is going to be picking me up out front. Here's your iced tea. Oh, thank you. What's that? I said, "oh, thank you". You're very welcome. Yeah, Mike, I'm done. Yeah, I'm just finishing up and driving away, So punch me out for the day. Hold it, Cole. A call just came in. I need you to go out and take a look. Write the guy an estimate, get the paperwork going. Come on, man. I've worked a double every day this week. I'm off. Just get Paul or Terry to do it. They're both doing an office job. You're all I got. I'm telling you, I'm freakin' exhausted. I'm literally seeing double. I just want to get home and sleep for like 17 hours. Go out there, walk around. Scribble some shit on the contract. You'll be back in the city by 6:00. - Where is it? - It's out in Haybrook. Haybrook? Fuck, Mike. I'll bump you up 10% on the commission. Shit. In 2/10 of a mile... turn right onto Cheswick Park road. Fuck you, lady. Fuck you and Mike, for sending me out... in the middle of goddamn nowhere. Hola. Hello? I'm here with Mahoney's carpet & floors. I'm here for the floors. Can you... can you buzz me in? Hola. Hi there. I'm here to take a look at your floors. No comprendo. - You don't speak english? - No. I don't even know how to say "Spanish" in Spanish. To the ear. Not even to the ear. Yes, over to the ear. Oh, to the rear. You want me to meet you around back? Adios. Okay. For the... The... The tracks. Thank you. S?. Aqua, por favor. So you want me to just wait here then? Hey, right here? I can't very well show a house... and leave off the master suite. Then try asking nicely. Henry, you're being completely ridiculous. What's completely ridiculous... is that I've never taken you to my bedroom. How about we move this to my office... where I can ply you with alcohol... and see where it goes from there? What about your wife? She's not in there either, but you're getting warmer. The mister... He comes. - I'll meet you in there... - Bye. ...in 20 seconds or less. - Are you the guy? - Yeah. Yeah, of course you are. You're also late. Sorry, I came from another job in the city. That's not my problem. Where is your... Your gear? Well, usually I survey the job first, then I find out what gear I need... and I go out to my van and get it... a little system I got worked out. - How's that working out for you? - So far so good. I'm sure this is just the beginning... of a long and fascinating conversation... Chock-full of the crude jargon of your profession. Unfortunately, I am engaged at the moment. So why don't you show yourself around? And I'll get to you when I can. Cool. I mean, awesome. So did you do it? Did I do what, Kirby? Henry, I know that for guys like you... the established rules of the game don't apply, but for the rest of us who have to scrape it down here at the bottom, The situation is a bit more... How can I put this? Serious. Stop it. You're breaking my goddamn heart. Where is she? - Who? - Your wife. Oh right, that. Well, she was here, but now she's not. She's at her book club. It's a long book club. They... They talk about a long book. And it's really far away. So she's not gonna be back until later... Much much later, So late in fact that she might never come back again... and you and I can just live here together. Henry, as much as you want this cat-And-Mouse thing To turn me on, it really doesn't. I think I got over rich bad boys... when I was about 20, and rich married guys when I was about 25. You and I are in a business relationship, that's all. Now I've worked my ass off for the last eight years... to get where I am today, and I'm not about to fuck that up. You'd better try another eight years... 'cause you still have a really... When was she here? An hour ago. Oh really? No, not really. I can't lie to you. But when she wasn't here, she did sign that thing That you've been wanting her to sign so badly. Where is that... Hello... Thing? This is her signature? I think you can see it's not mine. So no one sees her for over a week... and then she just pops in and signs something... that, from what you tell me, would send her over a fucking cliff, and then swings out to discuss literature? That's the story I'm going with, sure. You do realize that forging a signature... on a legal document is a federal offense? Please cuff me. I'm going to ask you one more time: Where is your wife, So I can contact her and get her to sign? Beats the hell out of me. To tell you the truth, I don't even know why I'm here. The floors look like they were done last week. So do it again. - Come on, Mike. - Run a spot check on it. The guy called for an estimate... Give him an estimate. - Who is this guy? - How the fuck should I know? - He's not exactly in my social circle. - Right. Speaking of social, are you gonna finally bring... your mystery family to my house on sunday... or is it just gonna be you again? Yeah, sure. Yeah, and as for the wife, you'd have better luck... spotting a fucking California condor. Yeah, probably, like chopped her up... and mailed her to the newspaper in like 43 packages. Hello? - I guess we could show it tomorrow. - You there? Yeah, about 9:00 am. Okay, okay, bye. - Can I help you? - I'm just here to look at the floors. Well, then you'd best get inside, because that's where the floors are. Hello? Yeah, I just came from there. Who are you talking to? Hello? Are you there? Yeah, Mike. Consider it done. Punch me out in 15. Have a nice weekend. Asshole. - It's a hell of a place you got here. - I know. - So are you coming or going? - Is that really any of your business? All right. So I wrote you up an estimate here. And I'm assuming You're looking to have all the rooms serviced? Okay. And when did you want the work done? Immediately... Tonight. Well, I'm afraid that's not gonna be possible. And by that you mean what exactly? I mean I can't do it. It's impossible. With an attitude like that, it's no surprise You're the one holding the clipboard. Look, a house this size, in that amount of time... It's a three-Man job at least. Look, I can schedule you for an appointment next week. I'll bring a couple of guys, do a beautiful job for you. Let's try it this way: I'm not especially interested in what you think is possible. I need the job done and I don't care If it takes you all night to do it. With all due respect, sir, I guess you're a wealthy gentleman... What makes you think I'm wealthy? For starters, Your house is a dead giveaway. Okay, let me explain something to you, Cole, If that's really your name And not the last guy who died in that suit... You don't pay for a house like this with money. You pay for it with clarity and well-Being. You pay for it with an all-Consuming repulsion Toward the concept of failure. So when a man says to me, "I can't do it," It makes me want to throw up. And I'm glad that it does, Because the day that I say, "I can't do it," Is the day that I taste the barrel of my shotgun. And, well, Cole, I'm not ready to die today. All right, all right, let's just take it back... You don't seem to feel the same. I'm prepared to make you an offer... $5000 To complete the job yourself, tonight. First of all, all billing goes through the office, so I can't... I'm talking about $5000 in cash in your hand. That's in addition to whatever I am charged by your company. Sir, that is a very generous offer, but the truth is... I'm coming off 5 straight days of double shifts... and this is a 3-man job at least. And I specifically asked for one man. Are you trying to tell me I didn't even get that much? What I'm trying to tell you is After a week like this I'm a liability. I'm insured. I can't do it. Asshole. You... I can't believe you're asking me to leave. I just... I don't think it's good for Sammy. I've already started the process... and all I ask is that you don't fight me on it. This is crazy. You know that? This is really crazy. I'm not gonna take everything. I'm gonna leave some of my stuff here. I assume that's all right? It's fine. Sammy's game on sunday... I suppose I'm not welcome there either. Look, what do you want from me? Honestly, I just want you to get better And start supporting this family like you used to. Jesus christ. Clean this up. Fuck. Hello? Hello. Just a second. Forget something? No, I... I had to make a... I went to... Come on, you can do it. I made a few calls and rearranged a few things. You... I think you said $5000. Do you have $5000 in cash? What do you think? Is it here? Wouldn't offer it to you if it wasn't. Can I see it? Oh, let's not cheapen the moment. We have an agreement or what? Yeah. Cool. If you don't mind me asking, what's the rush? I do mind you asking. What in god's name do these people eat? Look at you. You look like you got something up your ass, sir. What you got up there? You hiding something Up that rich gold-Plated ass of yours, You golden ass? Hello? Hello? You've reached the Sharpe residence. Please leave a detailed message at the sound of the tone... and someone will get back to you as soon as they can. Hi Susan. It's Liz. Where are you? You missed the last two book club meetings, And I'm just calling to check if everything's okay. I left a message on your cell also. I don't know what's up, so please call me back. Oh, and we're reading Death of a Salesman for next week. - I told amy that was a play, but whatever. - A book club, huh? Okay, call me back. Are you feeling any better? Jesus. I wish. You can't keep doing this to yourself. I know. I just... It's just a really bad time for me. You are not the only one. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I guess I'm just really not okay. You're just not the same. You need help. I know. Tell me we're gonna be able to work this out. I think we just should talk about that another time. Even if you don't think so, Just do me a favor And fake it for a second. Who's here? There's no one here. Where? In the house. Seriously? Come on. There's someone in here. There's no one here. There's no one here. Please just relax. Just lay down and relax, okay? - Who's here? - There's no one here. Lay down, relax. - There's no one here. - There's someone coming up the stairs. - There's no one here. Just stop it. - Where's Sammy? - Get away from the door. - Stop it. Stop. Damn it. Mom, what was that noise? Jesus christ, I really don't know how much more of this I can take. It's locked. Oh yeah. I... I thought you... You did? Good for you. But I'm not paying you to think, am I? I'm paying you to clean the place. No, I just thought you wanted all the rooms... Okay, cool. Well, I'm just about done here, So I'm gonna go ahead and... okay okay okay. Take it easy, guy. Take it easy. I'm just giving you a hard time. Yeah, I know. It's okay. You feel all right, guy? 'Cause you look a little... What's the word? Wasted. Huh? No, I'm good. Yeah? You good? That's what...? So this is what good looks like these days? 'Cause I'm real good too. You look it. You're fit. I feel real clean... Nothing on me. You know what I mean? Yes, I do. I sure do. - I bet you do. - Hey, that's my job. So listen, Have we met before? No, I don't think so. No? No. 'Cause you look... You look real familiar to me. You know who you remind me of? You look exactly like the guy Who came here last week, Cleaned the shit out of my septic tank... same exact uniform. Thanks. Well, unless there's anything else, I'm gonna just load up my rig and... Yeah... you think you could give me a hand with something? Yeah sure. What is it? It's in the garage. It's a little awkward. I left my keys in the house. I told her that people who use the ring... that comes with the phone deserve to die. I must have told her 50 times... if she doesn't change that ring, I'm gonna lose my mind. Did she change the ring? She didn't. All right, let's get these fuckers up in the car. One, two, three. All right, this one's heavy. Lift with your back. One, two, three. What the fuck are you doing? Nothing. I just... Well, then stop just breathing and get your fucking end up. Jesus christ. Sorry, I gotta make a call. - Just shut up the fuck up a second, okay? - I'm tired. Just meet me in the kitchen, guy. Hey, Jen, it's me. It's Cole again. Um, I just thought I'd try you again. Yep, I... I don't know, I just was calling to... I'd love to hear your voice right now, that's all. Um, I just wanted you to know I've been taking my meds Just like the doctor wanted me to and... Anyhow, I'll talk to you later. Just give me a call back. Love you both. Bye. Turns out... the only real strength... is knowing you can't do it alone. Just sit anywhere. I opened a few bottles just to let them breathe a little. Sam... that's my son's name. Huh? Sam... isn't that your son's name? Oh yeah. Small world. So that's a rabbit. It's formerly a rabbit. Now it's just rabbit. And we're gonna eat it. Francis Ford Coppola, my ass. Who? Nobody. He's nobody. Here, try this. No, that... that's all right. No? What, are you sober? Don't tell me you're sober. No, it's... medications then? Are you depressed, Cole, upset? Yeah right. Oh sure. Why the hell not? Well, that's one way to do it. Chateau maison ledoux, 1965. Susan's favorite. Susan... Is that your wife? Maybe I shouldn't be drinking this. She had her chance. You know what? To I'd, huh? May she rot in a special circle of hell... reserved just for miserable, blood-sucking cunts like her. Is she out of town, away? I mean, for a while? Something like that. So what about you, guy? Married, Fucking everything that moves, or both? No, I'm married. Or I was married. Just didn't work out. It's nobody's fault. It's just one of those things. Well, it sounds to me Like you found out a little too late That she prefers black guys. You know, we went through therapy and all the rest. I guess she just decided it was over. Of course, I was the last one to know, right? Turns out it's like a band-Aid. You just gotta take it off with one clean move... just like that. Just... You know, I was going through some really bad things. And isn't the whole thing with marriage... that you help out the other person... richer or poorer, sickness and health and all that? There was this time where I really needed her help, but nope, she just couldn't do it. Then all of a sudden the person... who's on your side... is leading the charge against you. Funny how that changes so fast. I used to think a strong man Should be able to do everything himself. The truth is, the only real strength Is realizing that you can't do it alone. I'll drink to that. Yeah, Susan... She's all right, I guess. The truth is, my wife and I... Don't you want to get that? Hey, the things I want to do, I do. The things I don't want to do, I don't do. You've reached the Sharpe residence. Please leave a detailed message at the sound of the tone... and someone will get back to you as soon as they can. So you still want to settle up? Jesus. Fuck it. Let's go take care of some business. What did I say? $5000? The money I've offered you is to help you forget... what you're about to see on the other side of these doors. Do you understand that? Yeah. Well, okay, let's have a look inside then. Here we have the master suite. Go ahead. You're a professional man, Cole. I'll give you 500 bucks If you can name that stench. Yeah, some... it's piss. It's dog piss, If you want to be precise about it. Yeah, Susan had this little fucking dog. And I swear it was put on this earth For the sole purpose of pissing on my house. But I took care of that bitch. I took care of the little dog too. Yeah. Things got a little out of hand, I guess. Oh, but don't worry. It's... It's wine. Mostly it's wine. I'd say pardon the mess, But the mess is what I'm most proud of. Does your wife know that...? What? That I killed her shit? She's got bigger problems than that right now. Either that or no problems at all, depending on how you look at it. Oh right. I forgot to show you the best part. Come here. Come on, check it out. Lady's powder room. In all fairness, you know, I took the idea from Susan. When we were first together, she used to write me These messages in her lipstick. I used to pretend to like it. Shit, I might have actually liked it, for a while. But then it started to seem, I don't know, kind of cheap to me, like something a hooker would do. Lady's powder room. Just once I'd like to hear... one of these real estate people call it what it is... "and here's the room where the lady of the house..." will take most of her shits... Not all of her shits, 'cause she'll probably take... one or two shits in a downstairs bathroom, just to keep the staff on their toes". And that's important, because if I walk into a bathroom in this house... and the toilet paper roll is not folded... to a perfect point like that... If it's not folded to a perfect point like that, I'm gonna lose my mind. Do you see that? You see that? You see that little guy right there? As long as I have that, everything's perfect. You see that? Now let me ask you something, guy: Is that the toilet paper roll point... of a man who just killed his wife and kid? - What? - Huh? Did you just say you killed your wife and kid? Shit. Did I? Because if I did, it was a mistake. Because if I didn't kill them, It'd be a mistake to say that I did, Because it would be false And so a mistake. On the other hand, if I did kill them, it'd be a mistake to tell you that I did, because then you'd know... and I'd have to do something about that. And you'd want to resist and there'd be a struggle... and so on and so forth. And that'd be too bad, because I feel like we're finally starting... to understand each other. Now you listen to me, you pathetic, used-up shell. Some people are coming here tomorrow, 9:00 sharp, to see this place. And it won't do for them to see what's gone on in here. You read me? It just won't do. - I can't do it. - Bullshit you can't. - It's too much. - We had a deal. - You said... - I said "all the rooms". Are you really in any position to turn me down? It's late. It's a three-Man job. Shut the fuck up! Thattaboy. Women... just like target practice, right? You knock one out, another one pops up right in her place. You might think about getting started there. After all, you're just one guy. There's no one here. Given the particulars of your condition, In addition to the added stress of a recent... Jesus. Fuck. I don't feel safe With you anymore. Hello, Cole. Shut up. You're not real. All right, if you say so. I bet this looks familiar. No? You know, in the end It's not the ways in which we're different... that define us, Cole. It's the things we've shared. That is our strength. I don't know what you think you're doing. This is private property. Well, it's not your private property, Cole. You only work here, right? So what do you think? Do you think he knows? Knows what? About us. About you and me. Kershe. At your service. Shut up. I... You're not real. Yeah. I'm afraid it's a little more complicated than that, Cole. You think you're the guy in the uniform... with his name stitched onto the tag, but you're not even the suit. You're just the name on the tag. I'm losing my mind. You don't have a mind to lose. You're not real. Unfortunately, Cole, you're not real. What are you trying to do to me? You really don't remember, do you? Or else you won't. It's amazing, isn't it... the lengths that we'll go to... to forget the terrible things we've done? What the fuck are you doing to me? Take it easy, Cole. I had been suffering from certain delusions. And from what I could gather, life with me... had become increasingly difficult for my family. I don't really think that you know... how fucking hard this has been for me. So I admitted myself... into a 30-day treatment program. I don't feel safe with you. But when the time came for me to go home, it was pretty clear that I was the only one... who thought that was a good idea. And these are for you as well. Use only as directed on the label. No mixing with alcohol. Okay. Everybody was concerned that I was gonna have a difficult time... out there... in the big bad world. I assured them they were wrong. But they'd already made up their minds. I've already started the process, okay? And all I ask is that you don't fight me on it. I was asked to leave my own house... the house that I had paid for... this is fucking unbelievable. ...By the woman that I had worked... so fucking hard to give it to. And I knew at that moment that... well, that I was all alone in the world. That was a feeling that followed me everywhere. Can somebody tell me just exactly... how the fuck something like this happens? - Mr. Kershe. - Take it easy. Don't tell me to take it easy, Todd. And with nobody on my side, it became palpably obvious... that everyone was against me. And the people who were supposed to be... the closest to me... they were the worst offenders of all. Mom! And I understood their indifference to my struggle... to be an attack... that they were trying to kill me... with their disregard. So I did what I felt I had to do... to protect myself. I didn't kill my family. No, you didn't. I killed my family. I know you. You'd have done the exact same thing. But then I had a new problem. The threat had been effectively silenced, but in its place I found... a rather unmanageable mess. And there was no question... that it had to be taken care of, but in my state I knew... that I was in no condition to do it myself. I knew I needed help. So I looked... deep into myself for strength... and there you were, Cole. I'm pretty sure... there's no way I could have done this without you. You were calm and collected... and efficient. You assessed the job. You gathered the appropriate tools... and went right to work... methodically removing all the traces of the mess... that I was powerful enough to create... but was too fucking weak... to see through to the end. And I've got to say, Cole... you did a hell of a job. You're insane. Well, we wouldn't be having this conversation if I wasn't. I gotta get outta here. Before you do, you should take a look in the shower. I'm actually a little surprised He left it off the grand tour. It's quite a show-stopper. Go ahead. It's nothing you haven't seen before. I'm gonna leave some stuff here... just in case. I hope that's okay with you. I noticed you're not helping me with my little problem. I'm talking to you, guy. You don't think he's gonna let you just walk outta here, do you? Cole. Let's think about this. Why do you think he was so insistent... about having just one guy clean this whole big house? Maybe because he couldn't handle more than one... when the job was finished? I don't know about you, But I'm not ready to die tonight. I can make it down to the highway And hitchhike my way out. Then what? You don't think he's gonna come after you? 'Cause he will. What are you saying? I'm saying... we did it before. How hard can it be to do it again? I can't. I can't do it. You don't have to. We stick to what we're good at. I'll make the mess. You clean it up. Trust me, Cole, okay? Just trust me. A special solution... You know, for the really tough stains. Yeah, all right. Hold it right there. Let me see those booties. There. Put down the box And put on the booties. So what do you want to hear first... The good news or the bad news? Well, the bad news is That there's no $5000 in this house. So there's that. The good news is That I won this bat at an auction And, as you can imagine, it's quite valuable... Quite valuable. In fact I think I paid just over $5000 for it. And that was a few years ago. There's garbage under the sink. A special solution, huh? For the really tough stains? I mean, is that what we're dealing with here... The really tough stains? Hey, guy, why is there...? Kershe? You've reached the Sharpe residence. Please leave a detailed message at the sound of the tone... and someone will get back to you as soon as they can. Henry, it's... well, it's me. It's Susan. So... listen. I don't know exactly what I was gonna say. The truth is, my wife and I have been having some trouble lately too. It's pretty late. I hope I'm not waking you up. - I haven't spoken to her in a few weeks. - I just... She's up with my kid in sonoma. I don't even know what the fuck that means, to be up in Sonoma. I really just wanted to call and talk. I guess I'm thinking that we should try to work this out. It's only money, you know? I guess we're gonna try to patch things up, my wife and I. I haven't spoken to her in a while, But I was thinking of calling her tomorrow. And Samuel... well, Samuel really misses his dad, you know? Okay. I shouldn't be leaving all of this on the machine.
