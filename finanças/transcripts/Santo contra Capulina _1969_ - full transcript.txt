Santo vs. Capulina What's up? Amantero! Excuse me. How's it going Ruben? I was almost late. How's it going Benito? What's up Stache? Lovely, just lovely. And I didn't even take a shower this morning. You're always late! You know how it is, you have to keep your eyes wide open. How am I supposed to sleep with my eyes open? You're paid to keep guard the place, not sleep, that's why you're the watchman! You have to sleep at night you know. Just a minute, the watch. Oh yeah, the watch. One of these days you'll forget your own head! I hope I don't forget! It's time, let's go. Where do you think it is? Let's check the registry. Here it is, section 'C'. It must be over there. Let's go. This is the place. Here it is. Blood! Now blood will flow! He's quicker than he looks. I'm a good helper, I caught one. I caught him, I caught him! Idiot, are you on their side? Don't insult me, I'm poor but honorable. Which way did they go? Now I'm not telling you. Listen, we need to keep them from coming in here again. They surely used a secret entrance, which way did they go? Well, I'll tell you if you give me an autograph. And you write what I tell you. Here. "To my best friend Capulina," "from his best friend and admirer," "Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask." Now tell me, which way did they go? I don't know sir! Then why did you lie to me? I just wanted an autograph to show to my kids. In any case, we've made some progress. I'll take that box to show to the police. No, that's impossible, you can't take anything from here. Those are orders from the management. Pretend they were stolen. Well now... it looks like you're on their side, doesn't it? I don't have time to argue, it must contain something very important. Well, because I trust you I'll let you take the box. Here. Take it, take it. Goodnight. Diamonds! Hidden in the ceramic. But how did you suspect it? They're worth a lot! The box contained items of little value that no one would order from abroad. Did you check up on the recipient? Like in the other thefts, the recipient doesn't exist. That's why they're sent to that warehouse. And when no one shows up to claim them, they're taken from the store room. Very ingenious, but how? At first I thought the watchman was in league with the smugglers, but now I doubt it, he's a simple man- even childlike I'd say. Who knows? Maybe he works for them. I think the warehouse must have a secret entrance. But my men have gone over it with a fine toothed comb! If only we knew which packages they'd go after. It'd be impossible to check them all. Why's that? I'll keep an eye on the watchman, if he's guilty, I'll make sure he gets punished. Santo must live here, I'm going to meet him! What a pleasure, what a pleasure to see you! I finally know what you look like! How's it going? Aren't you going have a struggle today? (Wrestle can mean struggle in Spanish) I struggle every day! Food doesn't put itself on the table. What a pleasure to meet you! Hey, why don't you have bruises on your face? Because my wife doesn't beat me. She's an angel! Of course, an angel because you're a saint (Santo)! What a pleasure to meet you! Yes, it's a pleasure to serve you. Hey, what does it feel like to be Santo? No, my saint is Paschal Baylon. Come on, don't fool around, aren't you Santo? Only if I'm the saint of retail. Stop joking, I mean, Santo the wrestler, that's not you? Wrestler? No, I'm not Santo. Then why are you wasting my time? Now ask me what I want. What do you want? None of your business! What do you mean none of my business, what do you want? How much for the mask? It's not for sale. Why not? Because it's a replica of Santo's mask. I'll give you 8.50. It's not for sale, it's not for sale! That's not the way to treat a client, shorty. Don't move, for the love of god, don't move! I'll give it to you, you can have it, but by all that's holy don't move, you'll destroy my store! It's Santo. Follow him! But he's too fat! Idiot, he must have a bullet proof vest on! Hey boys! Hello, my little friends. My friend Capulina told me to drop by and say, 'hello'. Take off that mask, Capulina. I can't. Can't you see I'm Santo? Just because we're small doesn't mean we're dumb! There's Santo. Wait! We shouldn't kill him in front of witnesses. And how did you guess it was me? Santo wouldn't have such a big belly. Oh, I guess so. What luck, we're about to discover his secret identity. If only we had a camera to take a picture. Since we don't, watch closely. I bet you don't even know Santo. Sure I do, look what he gave me. It's an autograph with a dedication- look. I think you wrote it yourself. Don't mistrust your trainer! How are we going to train today? Today we're going to train for the 350 km walk. You'll win the gold medal for 1972... And you for '76... And you in '80, like that... - We're ready - What do we do? Walk real fast, and since this the first day you'll do 2 laps around the field. Alright, everyone line up. You do the same thing I do, ok? I'm obviously going to win because I'm the instructor. On your mark, get set, go! I won! Ok, time to go to school, we'll come back another day. No wonder no one knows what Santo does in his free time. Another piece of machinery gone to waste, I wish the genius who created it would use his knowledge to benefit mankind. Of course it's me stupid! Boss, we saw Santo without his mask on. Are you sure it was him? Of course, he took it off in front of us. That isn't enough, don't lose sight of him, and call me every half hour. I'll finally get my revenge by killing Santo. He'll pay for what he did to me. It'll be ready in half an hour. Santo will have be quite surprised when he trains with his friend. - Who's that? - I don't know, it's his first time here. Your camera. I'm a journalist, I just wanted an exclusive interview. And you'll have it, but not that way. I'm going to go train now, you can wait outside if you like. To be honest, I'm not just looking for an interview. I'd like to see your face. Any special reason? We women are very curious. That curiosity has cost many their lives. So long. - Did you get a picture? - No, As soon as he steps in to the ring, kill him! Hey, what are you doing? Hi, is Juan here? Juan what? I Juana find the guy I'm looking for. Look, don't waste my time! I wanna go in. Do you have some reason to? I'm here to see Santo. Without his orders you can't go through. And what's this? He's my friend. Fine, go on in. You see now that that's Santo? He came to the gym to train. Let's go. - Hold it, where are you going? - We want to watch the training. I'm sorry, Santo's training, come back some other time. - But we were just... - Police orders. Fine, where's the nearest phone? On the corner. - Thank you! - You're welcome! Fight champ, that's it! I want to talk to you Listen, I wanna talk to him. Calling Santo. Calling Santo. Why don't you buy a phone? Santo here, I'm listening. We have a lead, you need to come here. - I'm on my way. - Hey, I wanted to talk to you! I'm sorry, another day. It's just that I wanted you to see my kids. My kids! He ignored you, didn't he? Of course he did, he's my friend. Santo doesn't have friends. Why not? He can't have friends because he's a bad man. A criminal. What? Why do you think he covers his face? Maybe he's cold? No sir. It's so no one knows who he is. He's a murderer, and you must help me learn what he looks like. But why me, why not ask someone else? No one knows what he looks like. Not even his mother? No one. Now do you see why it's so important to get his mask off? I have an idea. Look, seeing how he's my friend I'll ask him to lend me the mask, he'll take it off, we'll see his face and that's that! No, let's think of something else. Fine girly, have it your way but I'll need some... Impossible because you're "out". Come on, hurry! It doesn't matter if we lost him, we know where to find him tomorrow. An investigation has given us some very interesting results. These are false names or wrong addresses for packages shipped internationally. There's many of them, more than I thought. That's why I think they'll try to rob the place again tonight. It's possible. I'll be prepared. I messed up! You finally got here! A very important man is waiting for you. Could it be a movie producer? Clown! Oh, a circus owner? Circus my grandmother! Oh, if it's your grandmother I can't keep her waiting! Excuse me. It's great that you came to see my kids, but I didn't bring them along, I'll go get them. Hold on, stop babbling and listen: do you know what this is? Oh Santo, how could I not know? What is it? It's a watch, and do you know what it's for? How could I not know? What's it for? Aside from telling time it emits a secret signal in a special frequency which I get on a special reciever, understand? Of course, how couldn't I? It's a signal to for when you want me to come. But you're already here What are you going to do if the thieves break in again tonight? I'll go home. No, you'll call me with this so I can take care of the crooks. Now I understand. They come in, I call you, you trap them Man, that's too easy, even I could do that All you have to do is press this button. The button. It lit up. Exactly, that's all you have to do. Will you remember? Of course, but I'd remember better if I switched my ring from one finger to another. So why don't you do it? Because I don't own a ring. So you do it right just remember you're doing it for your country. What? So it is, your country needs you. Me? Capulina? I feel like an important man Good. Good evening. Thanks! Hey! Don't forget you have to come with me to see my kids! Where are the thieves? Thieves? Why did you call me? To see if you would come whenever I called. Yes, whenever you call. Alright, now I understand perfectly. So this doesn't happen again call me with 3 long beeps and 2 short ones, like this... So if I don't call you like that you won't come? That's it. But if I call you like that you will? Look, why don't I leave and you call me? Listen... I could have someone else here to help me but I don't want the thieves I'm trying to catch thinking something's going on. You have to stay here, understand? Well, alright, but you have to teach me how to wrestle. Alright. I'll show you a key... Don't play around Santo! Alright, alright, I'll do it. If some guy tries to hit you like this, what would you do? I'd stop it like this. Let's see if you learned. If he tries to hit you like this, what would you do? I know, like this. No no, come on. Let's hope you learn. If I tried to hit you like this, what would you do? For my country, for my country! For our country. I'm starting to feel real brave. You're going to need it. Now what did you say about the beeps? 4 long beeps and 5 short? No, it was 5 long and 8 short... Calling Santo. Calling Santo. Santo here, I'm listening. What's going on? You weren't answering my calls. The signal was weak but I've taken care of it. Where are you? Guarding the internation shipment warehouses. I need you to come to my office immediately. I'll head that way. You can trap Santo here. - You brought the money? - Yes sir Good, the game's over. C'mon boss, shoot. Surrender! Don't touch that button. Not even bullets will stop us. Who are you? What are you? Machines, and soon you'll be like us. What package are we looking for this time? No package, we have orders to destroy everything. It's a shame, there's millions of pesos worth of merchandise here. Alright, where do we start? Over there. The chief isn't in. How strange, he just called me. You can wait in his office. Alright, I'll wait. Everything for my country! I'm calling Santo. Run away, it's gonna blow up! I'm gonna blow up! That's right! I won! I made them run away by myself! Sorry for the delay Santo, but I had to go to the laboratory. Anything new? Fake diamonds. I had the diamonds examined, they're made of plastic and are worth nothing. That doesn't explain what the thieves were doing in the warehouse. Maybe it was a false clue? They might be planning another attack and used it to distract us. That's likely. I guess this case is a loss. Good night. The diamonds are real, whoever wants to stop me now will need to use a very powerful weapon! The warehouse didn't explode, you know what happens to those that fail me Santo left in his car, we saw him leave. That was a trick, the real Santo is in there. Fine, I'll give you another chance. Go get him! Hey, who are you? I'm Capulina. I'm Capulina. Enough games. I congratulate you Professor, you've made another perfect robotic reproduction and shall be paid accordingly! Thank you. Now we have to make Capulina record the robot's memory with what we want it to tell Santo. I'm not going to be able to do that? Why not? Because I don't want to. I do want to! That's better. Read this. I don't know how to read. I do know how to read! Go on, read. The Infernals will go at midnight to pick up smuggled jewels. They'll enter through the south side's alley Did it register? It's registered. So I can go now? No. I'm not needed here, I'm not doing anything. We need your voice to record more messages. But no one's going to believe what I say if I don't do this. Catch him robot! Not him, Capulina! Hello children, have you seen Capulina? Do you know where he lives? I promised I'd show you how to wrestle. Finally, do you always make women wait so long? Forgive me, I didn't know. Don't tell me you forgot about our interview. Yes, but now I'm at your service. - I'd like a few photos of you in action. - Alright, let's go. Why the rush? Oh sorry, I didn't mean to barge in. Wait Capulina! Sorry, I didn't know you were with your wife. I'm not his wife. But you're dating, right? Think what you want, but tell me, where were you last night? I went back to the warehouse and you weren't there. I didn't leave, they took me. I escaped and here I am! Who took you and where? I can't tell you in front of her. Alright. Excuse me Miss. Santo, you have to understand, there's another me that isn't me, is that clear? Yes. - Alright, tell me what you understood. - Nothing. Look, I just don't want you listening to the me that isn't me. Capulina, I don't have time for more... more nonsense! It's not nonsense sir, this me is your friend, the other me is your enemy. and anyway, it's a secret. Tell me some other day. It's the Inferals' secret! The Infernals? What did you say about the Infernals? The Infernals will go at midnight to pick up smuggled jewels. They'll enter through the south side's alley. Good thing I'm made of rubber. Why so worried? A difficult case. Can I help? I doubt it. You told your friend I was your girlfriend, don't you trust your girlfriend? If you're involved in what's going on just remember that playing with fire is dangerous. Yes, that's true. Get out of here! Just a minute, he's my friend. Stupid robot, this isn't the moment to strike. I had almost gained his trust. Go back to your guards. Let him go, take the robot away. - But. - I'll take responsibility. Santo to HQ. Control to Santo, over. Where are they holding you, over. I don't know, but I'm fine, over. Don't worry, I'll try to rescue you, over. That's how you repay me for rescuing you from your kidnappers? They shaved my head?! (shaved and kidnapped sound alike) Nah, you're kidding. I didn't say they shaved you, but that you were taking hostage. Oh... what's that?! Yes, and since I did you a favor you should respond in kind. Is this a declaration of love? Now you owe me a favor. If this is about money I prefer being kidnapped. It's not like that, I just want to know who Santo is. If you're his girlifriend why don't you ask him? He doesn't want to tell me. Maybe he's married. So you'll help me? Nah, you started too many rumors, that he's a killer, he's a criminal. It's because I'm a woman in love, and a woman in love is capable of anything. Anything? Even asking him? It's useless. Well, just because you look a like nice person I'll help. Thank you. Don't get carried away, your boyfriend's real strong. There he goes! Don't worry, he didn't see anything. Follow him. What should I do? Take a picture with this camera. Good luck. She's falling for me! Can I come with you? Where are you going? I want to learn to catch bandits Alright, maybe you can help me with something. Let's go. A toast to your success dear. Go on, don't be afraid. I wouldn't poison you knowing that thanks to you I have your father under control. Cad! If you hate me so much why do you help me? Because that way you'll let us go. That's right, I gave my word. As soon as Santo dies I'll let you and your father go. Why did you make me stop here? It's because I'm hungry. Fine, hurry up! Don't you eat? Not right now - Hey, do you ever take off your mask? - Sometimes. Do you take it off to sleep? Hey now, why so many questions? Do you take it off to shower? Of course I take it off, I wasn't born with it! Now what's going on? I'm not hungry anymore. You're going to go in the daytime? How did you find the entrance? I have my ways. Are you ready to catch the bandits? Not yet, I need your help. I'll help you on one condition. Anything, I need to save a man's life. Do you give me your word? I do. I'll help you if you take off your mask. Agreed. Give me a big smile please. I did it, now it's your turn. What should I do? I already told you, I have my ways. The television camera didn't discover Santo's identity either. We'll have to kill him. No, not that. You told me Santo was a murderer, but now that I've met him I know that's a lie. Shut up, you've failed! I'm only sparing you because of your father. Just a minute! Tonight at midnight the Infernals will come to take the jewels. You already told me, that's why I'm here. Me? But you didn't want to listen to me. At the gym, don't you remember? The me that isn't me told you. Then it's a trap. Of course it is! Perfect. I'll give you something to help me. They're jumping beans! - Put them here. - Now you're a robot. Hold it! Now you're going to pretend to be the me that isn't you, understand? Of course I do. The me that isn't me... Oh, the rubber one! Exactly, tonight will decide everything. Did you understand the instructions? Repeat them robot. Attack Santo. Kill Santo. You see? All that mechanical strength against Santo, who won't defend himself because he'll think it's his friend Capulina Yes, you said the same thing about the police chief, and yes Santo is still alive. I overestimated his strength, but this robot is ten times stronger and won't fail. He better not, it's your last chance. If you do your daughter will die. I'll keep it in mind. This will be the last attempt to recover the merchandise. Understood boss, just as soon as our friend finishes with Santo. - You know what you have to do now. - Yes, now I'm the rubber one. Hold it! We failed again. The scientist will pay. Let's head to the laboratory. Come out and wait in the laboratory, be ready when I come for you. I'm ready. I'm just taking the plans for the inventions, don't forget you promised me protection. Agreed, did you get a weapon? Here it is. - Let's go. - Follow us. He tried to force me to reveal my secrets, he had a gun. Don't worry Professor, I'd just be hurt if you left without saying goodbye. My robot triumphed, right? No, I'm afraid you'll have to fix it. Get out robot. It looks like he's very damaged, I'll check him. Let's examine the robot. Please, help us get out of here! I'm made of rubber. That man will kill us! I'm made of rubber. We have to all run at the same time. To open the door you have to move the control. Is the control made of rubber? No, to open the door. Watch out Father! Get that gun! Careful! Be careful Capulina! Out of the way! This one. Now this one. Back to this one. One at a time, one at a time! We won! There he is. He pretended he couldn't walk, I bet he could've won a marathon! There's an explanation for that. Cedric got medical treatment in the United States. He bought stolen jewels from all over the world, and placed them in his wheelchair. But how didn't anyone notice? No one suspects a cripple. And now I get to keep the chair. Mexico, Mexico! On your mark, get set, go! - How's it going Santo? - How's it going? How are you? What happened, you don't want to see Santo's face anymore? No, now I expect we'll start dating. Well now Santo, someone's going to see your face. And how's the chief? Getting better quickly and quite happy. Thanks to you a large international gang was destroyed. You know that whenever you need me you just push the button, it'll call me and I'll be right there to help you. Excuse me, I'm going to keep training!
