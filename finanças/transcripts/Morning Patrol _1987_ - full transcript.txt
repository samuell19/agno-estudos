MORNING PATROL A NIKOS NIKOLAIDIS FILM Excerpts are from: D. du Maurier, P. K. Dick, R. Chandler and N.N. The film was shot in Athens between October 1985 and February 1986. Written and Directed by Nikos Nikolaidis Last night, I dreamt I went to Manderley again. It seemed to me I passed through the great iron gate... with its rusted spokes... and walked along the drive in front of me. It was narrow and unkempt. Not the drive that we had known. The gravel was choked with grass and moss. I came upon the house suddenly and I stood... because there was Manderley. Our Manderley... Secret and silent, as it had always been. The grey stones shining in the moonlight of my dream. When I'm awake and in fear... I think of Manderley without a trace of bitterness. Those images can never be dissolved. They are memories that cannot hurt. All this, I resolved while dreaming. For like most, I know that I'm dreaming. We can never go back, that much is certain. The past is still too close. We have no secrets from one another now. We share everything, but we never talk about Manderley... for Manderley is no longer ours. Manderley is no more. I have to keep talking or I'll die. I have to keep walking... even if I risk getting caught by the Morning Patrol. Because if I stop I'll fall asleep and never wake up again. Like so many of us. I was returning home after years when something happened... and I'm no longer the same. That is all I remember. The stupidest question anyone on Earth could ask is: "Where the hell has everybody gone?" Sometimes I see them in the distance... sliding down the hills, heading west. They die heading west. They kill each other over a drop of wafer... or they get killed by Patrols. Black jack on the red queen. Black ace on the three. That's how it should be. Now, I'm miles away from home... in a country that seems foreign. In a few minutes, I may wake up... or be found lying dead, on the side of the road. Last spring, I felt very tired. Then, I realized I was growing old. It's mid-winter now and everything is getting worse. All I own is a coat and a knife and I feel awful. I keep thinking, maybe I had a man once. Or maybe I lived with my parents. My father must be dead by now. Our world is a grave... our pain and fears lie buried in its ruins. What does it matter where you are once you're dead? Whether a dirty swamp or a marble tower. You're dead now and you no longer care. To you, oil and water are the same as wind and air. You sleep the big sleep... Untouched by all this filth. So I left him and followed the road to the big bridge. But all you out there must keep away. You must stay in your peaceful beds. Your heads beating a brief, uncertain murmur... and your thoughts as grey as ashes. Soon, you too will sleep the Big Sleep. For this land is ours no longer. Manderley exists no more. When I was fifteen... and came to the island for the summer... there weren't as many houses and people. We hadn't noticed then, the beauty of the island and the sea. I spent the summer of '42 with my friends Oscy and Benjie. They called us "the terrible trio". And that house up there was his house. And nothing since then... and no one has made me feel as frightened or confused. Because no one in my life has ever made me feel more secure... yet insecure. More important yet insignificant. I lost him that summer of '42. Nor was I ever to learn what became of him. We were different. Kids were different then. It took us longer to understand the things we felt. Life was made up of small comings and goings. And for everything we won... there was something we lost. In the summer of '42, we raided the Coast Guard four times. We saw five movies, and had ten days of rain. Benjie broke his watch... Oscy gave up the harmonica... and I, in a very special way, lost my own self. We always talked about a trip we never made... far from the tranquil sea. But in the end, at the moment of departure... I asked nothing... I knew nothing. M y body just followed. We were speaking of different trips. I was twelve. I was sixteen... my heart beating fast upon the sand hills. I thought I was ready to face anything. Except the terror of this nightmare. But I still hear the music, that kept me company... till the end of my childhood. Mixed with the sound of the sea. With fingers over my tight-shut eyes... I can still see red, from the fires... and the explosions of the sun. And my hands covered in blood. And the picture of a body, disappearing in the dark. After some time, everyfhing comes back to me. A metal soldier blocks my way. I tell him some story and he lets me pass. But the music is not the same. And the sea is of another age. That's where I find everyone again, but without names. Nighttime is the best time to run. Here you find nothing but shadows... skeletons... and empty houses with white curtains. This is where I'll wait for you. When I was fifteen... and came to the island for the summer... there weren't as many houses and people. I often see their faces floating to me from the dark. I turn to meet them... but it's getting late. The sun has set and the night comes fast. Then, there are no more faces. There is no sea. There is nothing. And I am no longer there. I found it on a dead body, so I took it. Did you help him? - How? - To die. He was dead when I found him. You mean murdered. Yes. What could I do? I had to get through. So you did... Now what? Here there's food... a place to sleep. Water. I had to get in. I've seen people dying outside. - What has happened? - Happened? Whatever happened everywhere. Where have you come from? I don't know... all I remember is walking. I walked through hills and ruins. There are lots of bodies on those hills. Manderley... Have you heard of Manderlay? I think that's where I came from. Last night, I dreamed I went to Manderley again. It seemed to me, I passed through the great iron gate. What's happened to your hand? I don't know. It looks like a burn. I don't know how I got it. I must be sick. Oil and water are the same as wind and air to you. Please tell me what happened. You don't remember anything? Nothing... All I remember is walking. - To go where? - West, towards the sea. What? Isn't there a sea in the West? Everybody thinks so... They all go west looking for it. But no one has ever returned to tell us. Why is that? Because no one ever gets there. And it's probably worse. What's worse? A worse death. Don't you remember anything? No one does. Is that your bicycle? How long have you been following me? - Since you entered the city. - Who are you? I wish I knew. Now I'm with the Morning Patrol. Why do you carry a gun'? ...To kill. It's a solution. For whom? For all of us. So why did you let me live? I haven't... yet. I thought you might remember something. And if I do, you'll let me live? You'll need two days to get out. On the third day, if you're still in the city... I'll have to kill you myself. That's my job. This will help point you west. Stay away from movie theaters, stores and phone booths. They're all traps. Nighttime is the best time to run. Do you have a name? Why? Do I need one to be killed? What if I kill you first? Who knows? You may take my place on the Morning Patrol. But you'll need these first. You've got three days. Deal? Moonlight can play odd tricks upon the fancy. Even upon a dreamer's fancy. As I stood there hushed and still... I could swear that the house was not an empty shell. That it lived and breathed as it had lived before. If you're looking for your pills, they're on the table. Stop playing games, I need those pills. Ok, what do you want? Get me out of the city. In exchange for my medicine? I could have killed you, you know. Yes, but who would help you then? - When did it start? - What? The pain. I don't know... about two weeks ago. First, my bones were aching and cold. Then I got a fever. You were moaning in your sleep. You must get me out of the city. - That's not easy. - Make it easy. There are only a few exits and they're heavily guarded. And I have to sign in every day. If I don't show up by tomorrow... they will be looking for two. Who are "they"? The Morning Patrol. I keep the pills. You'll get them back when I'm out of here. What are you doing? You'll see. Morning Patrol identification: Code 33, Alpha Sector. Reporting 4 dead in movie theater on borders 3-4. - Credit them to 33. - You killed them? Let's get out of here. My throat ached... My fingers were numb. Like they were someone else's fingers. Like the ones they send us by mail... along with the identity card, badge and diploma. The world was dark out there. And then something red, like a virus under a microscope. And then nothing. Only darkness, isolation and traps. The long and lonely night had just begun. I never understood why death smelled like honeysuckle... and was always heading west. I'll get you out of this city. Either dead or alive. In a coffin tied with thick black cable... on a humid, moonless night. I could have killed her at any time. But when there's a gun at your back... you're supposed to be doing what it says. Later... hands dirtier than mine will take care of her. Her deep blue eyes were staring without seeing me. Why did you stop? Central to Alpha 19. There's a guard up there. You go first... You've got the gun. Move it! If they kill me, who's gonna get you out of here? Whoever kills you... Move! Come in Alpha 19. I can't. Central to Alpha 16 & 17. Secure Sector 5, west. Locate Number 19. He last reported from Sector 5. Over. Stop right there! Wait here. Alpha 16 to Central. Securing Sector 5, in 20 minutes. Alpha 17 calling Alpha 16. Contact point: Bridge. Central calling Alpha 16 & 17. Alpha 16 reporting from Bridge. All nineteen are dead. Securing building in 10 minutes. Let's get out of here, before they trap us. Haven't we met before? Where? Back East? Yes. What's it like back East? Alpha 17 now securing west side of building. Central switching to Blank frequency 3. Don't you remember anything? Alpha 16. Received. Let's go. You must remember something... You had a house up on the hill. I used to watch you from afar. No, I don't remember... nor have any scars to remind me. Nor photographs, nor something forgotten in my pockets. Even the clothes I'm wearing must be someone else's. I'm afraid of death... afraid of dying. Scared of black waters and empty sculls. Water tastes strange nowadays. The river's still far, and time's running out. I often see her face floating to me from the dark. I turn to meet her... but it's getting late. The sun has set, the night comes fast and she's not there. Neither is the river. Nor is anything. I'm not even there. People who tried to leave this city were carried out in coffins... bound with thick black cable. On a humid, moonless night. Then there was something red, like a virus under a microscope. I wonder where she hid my pills. Perhaps in the house where we spent the night. Maybe she's carrying them with her. She probably knows she'll need them soon. So, on my way downtown, I had two double whiskies, at a bar. They didn't help much. But they made me recall that platinum blonde... which I'll never see again. Central calling Alpha 16. Switch to Blank frequency. Alpha 16 to Central. Alpha 19 is deceased. Cause unknown. Medicine is missing. Awaiting command. Central requesting Alpha 18's return to base. Alpha 17 to replace the deceased. It's useless to keep asking: "What happened here?" You end up with a piece of black marble on your face... blood bursting from your belly and your fingers turning info wax. All we need is clean water and some luck. Either dead or alive, it's all the same. One way or another, I'll get you out. If all goes well. All will be fine. - Are you in pain? - Not yet. First your body gets cold, and your bones ache. Then you get a fever. Isn't that how it begins? Let me have a look. Hold this. - Does it hurt? - No. It did now. Have you killed many people? No. Any women? Four, including you. Maybe five. I have to leave for a few hours. Where are you going? To work. I'll come with you. You can't. I want to see how you kill. I want to watch. Don't worry, I'll return. I promised I'd get you out of this city. Didn't I? If I don't get busy, they'll start looking for me. My quota is one body per day. If I don't report one by tomorrow, I'll be considered a suspect. That's why I have to go. What if you get killed? You'll head west. You're taking me with you tomorrow. I need to sleep now. I bet you we'll find the sea. See anything? Nothing. Keep watching... someone will show up. Everyone's looking for a phone that's ringing. What's wrong? Nothing. Something's moving! Where? Behind the car, to the right. Let it reveal itself. There's nothing there. Stop worrying and keep watching. Central calling Sectors 5, 6 and 7. Switch to Alert frequency. Sector 5 to Central. Now on Alert frequency. Central to Sectors 5, 6 and 7 Search for 33. Arrest issued for Alpha 33. Deny west-Sector entrance. Sectors 5 and 6 to Central. Acknowledged. Alpha 6 and 7 now on Alert frequency. West Central to all Alpha units. Morning Patrol on Alert. What now? We'll fake it into Sector 5, then circle back to 3 and 4. Sectors 3 and 4 are behind us. We'll get to the river through the railway. Central requesting radio silence for 30'. Over and out. Our turn to sing. Alpha 33 to Central. Central to 33. Justify position and means of transport. Reporting phone-trap in Sector 5. Credit dead female to 33. Central to 33... Contact Headquarters immediately. Contact in 4 hours. Reporting two traps in Sectors 6 and 2. Central 5 to Central 6 and 7. Phone-trap placed by 33 is confirmed. Male found with throat wound. Perpetrator's identity unknown. Switch to Blank frequency. All circuits are monitored. Receiving you. Stay out of Sector 6. You're wanted. I know. State final destination. Sectors 3 and 4. - Then what? - Don't laugh... Some people, carrying a gun, say the sea still exists. Need any help? No. You never saw me... or things will get worse. You neither. Get off the road. - They've blocked the west exit. - What about the old airport? They just shut it down. Get off the road now! Over and out. Why did we stop here? What time is it? It's broken. We'll leave as soon as it gets dark. Are you alright? The river's still far and time's running out. I have no watch, but I can sense if. Besides, watches aren't made to measure this kind of time. I often see her face floating to me from the dark. I turn to meet her but it's getting late. The sun has set, the night comes fast and she's not there. Neither is the river. Nor is anything. And I am no longer there. - What's this? - Cyanide. What for? It ends the nightmare in 5 seconds. They say your whole life flashes before you... but you're too far gone to shout about what really happened. The river is 4 kilometers away. You'll get through easily in the dark. I'll cover you till the stream. After that you're on your own. I just stood there watching him die. Why did he save my life? Perhaps he believed in the sea too. We are both tormented by the same questions. "Where am I from?" "Where am I going? How long have l got to live?" Does it matter anymore? Oil and water are the same as wind and air to you. You sleep the big sleep. This filth can't touch you now. His eyes were staring without seeing me. Dead or alive... I'll get you out of this city. The Patrol was on its way. Don't think I've given up. This is my last chance... and they won't take me alive. There are so many stories about us. They say that beyond the river and in the valley of death... seven angels pray for those who escape the city. So, when the battle's over and the smoke clears... they carry you to the sea. Dead or alive, it makes no difference. Don't think I've given up. Do you have a name? Translated by Vicky Harris Adaptation by Katerina Nikopoulou
