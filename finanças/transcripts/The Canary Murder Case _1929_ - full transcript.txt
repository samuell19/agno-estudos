[Music] [Music] Tell me, Vance What happened backstage? Were you able to see the Canary? No luck, Charles. She’s about as hard to get at in a dressing room as she is in that swing. [Music] [Applause] Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK If you want an idea what I ran into back there let me point out a few of her admirers… [Applause] See that man standing in the box opposite? Yeah… [Music] That’s Dr. Lindquist. He was outside her dressing room just now, along with these other two. I understand that the Canary has her claws in all three of them. Are they rich? Naturally. Then what does she want with my son? The allowance I give Jimmy is hardly tempting. Ah my dear Charles, our little feathered friend in the swing there has social ambitions. She wants to be Mrs. Jimmy Spottswoode. Impossible. I’d do anything in my power to prevent that even if Jimmy still cared for her. And I still believe that she’ll listen to dollars and cents. I wouldn't be too sure of that, Charles. As you know, I’ve more or less made a hobby of crime and criminals. That girl is no ordinary blackmailer. I'm firmly convinced that she'll stop at nothing to marry Jimmy. But Jimmy won’t have her. I tell you, he's really come to his senses. Another girl? Yes. You know her - Alice. Oh yes, of course. A very nice girl too. Yes, she is. Vance, I'm afraid that I’ll have to use my own judgment in this matter. I'm going to see this Canary at her apartment as soon as possible. Oh very well, Charles, but act quickly. Oh I know you'll smile but… You know, I have a strange premonition that the Canary is headed for disaster. [Applause] [Music] Evening Mr. Spottswoode. Hello there. It… shall I announce you to Miss O'Dell? No, don't bother. That's perfectly all right. Very well. Jimmy! Alice… Jimmy, you were going to see the Canary again. No, I wasn’t, dear. In fact, I just started to put this note under the door to tell us her so. Oh Jimmy, I'm afraid of her. Oh, she’s clever and cruel and unscrupulous. She’ll hurt us again, I know she will. No dear, she can't hurt us now. Boy, will you announce my… Oh, never mind. Oh yes sir. Hello Jimmy! Why hello dad! Good evening, Alice. Good evening, Mr. Spottswoode, You know I'm delighted that you and Jimmy have made it up again. Thank you. You know I'm gonna try to show you that all show girls aren’t like, well… Like the Canary, eh? Yes. Yes, I want to talk to her. Do you suppose she's home yet? I suppose so. No dad, you know, you're you're a regular guy, helping me out with this thing, You know, if the Canary ever came between Alice and me again I don't know what I’d do. I don't know what I’d do. It's all right, Jimmy. I'll do everything I can. Shall I go along with you? No, I can handle this better alone. I’ll send in my name now. [phone ringing] Mr. Spottswoode is calling. Send him in, please. Good evening, Miss O'Dell. Good evening. Shall we go over here? Well yes! Will you sit down? Thank you. Well I don't think we need waste anytime, Miss O'Dell. You know why I am here. How much? Nothing doing, Mr. Spottswoode. I've decided to marry Jimmy. I'm afraid that marriage is quite out of the question, Miss O'Dell. Oh you're sure about that are you? I'm positive. Well how would you like me to tell the world about Jimmy's embezzling from your bank? What? You heard me. You know, Jimmy has a weakness for writing letters and I have a weakness for using them. If Jimmy did write you a letter, you will tear it up. Now, before I leave here. Sure, go ahead. Tear it up yourself. My memory is still perfect. Yes, I see. Very well. You win. Now what do you really want? I've told you what I want. I want to be Mrs. James Spottswoode and that's that! Haven't you any heart? Won't you give him up, Miss O'Dell? For the sake of his happiness. For the sake of the girl whom he really loves. Give him up. No, what do you want me to do? Burst out crying? Listen Mr. Spottswoode, I know all about Jimmy and Alice and if he marries her, I'll tell every newspaper in this country that he's a dirty thief. No no, you wouldn't dare do that. That's blackmail. Sure it is! Call it anything you like, but get this into your head That's what I'm going to do! Well that remains to be seen. Good night. [phone ringing] Mr. Cleaver, please. This is Mr. Cleaver speaking. Now see Mr. Cleaver, the great reformer. Well this is your favorite weakness. Don't get nervous, baby. I’ve got some news for you. Good news? Yes darling, I'm going to marry young Spottswoode. Well well, may I send you my hottest congratulations. You bet you can, but send them from Tiffany's. What was that? You heard me. And send me one of those fancy autographs of yours on a nice fat check. I'm very sorry but I'm afraid I shall have to refuse. Ah be yourself. Big reformers who lead double lives can't refuse. Now look here, I’ll see you dead first! Listen, you'll be here after the theater with the dough and like it! The little rat! [phone ringing] May I speak to Mr. Louis Mannix, please? Quiet, quiet, my wife... Don't get excited. I just thought you'd like to know I've sold the body down the river. I'm gonna marry young Spottswoode. Heh, splendid! Yes darling. And I’ve decided that you're the best man. Best man? Yeah, the best man I know of to kick in with a nice handsome present in cash. Now see here, you know I can't afford... What you mean is you can't afford to let the ball and chain know what a big hearted Santa Claus you've been. Now look here, I've told you what I'd do to you if you ever got to the wife. Forget that bunk! And be on my front porch after the show with that check or I'll get to your wife all right! [phone ringing] This is Dr. Linguist speaking. Oh yes, Dr. Linquist, how would you like to do me a little favor? Certainly Margaret. I'd do anything for you, you know. How would you like to go jump in the lake? Oh Margaret, don't joke with me. I'm not in a mood for it. Oh get wise to yourself. I'm through with you. You give me the willies. I've warned you, Margaret. I'm desperate! If I can't have you no other man shall ever have you alive! Tony! In person, baby. How's my little squaw? I thought you were still in jail. Well I got tired of the big house, Mrs. Skeel, so I dropped in to see my little wife. I'm not your wife. How come? I divorced you six months ago. Yeah? Listen baby, a little thing like a divorce don't mean anything to me. I heard you taking those suckers down over the phone and I'm in and in on the works, 50-50. You big crook, you're not in on this one. Don't, you big heel! Hey I ought to bump you off. You do and you'll swing for it. Well maybe it'd be worth it. Now get this, I'm in on this racket and I'll be back for my cut. Yeah? Try and get it. Say baby, don't bother changing the box on this door. The lock I can't pick is still in Yale. Miss O'Dell, may I see you for a few moments please? It won't get you anything but come ahead. Thank you. I have something to say to you, Miss O'Dell, which I believe will make you change your mind about Jimmy. Paper mister? Morning paper. No no no. Thanks, mister. Very well, Miss O’Dell. That suits me perfectly. Think it over tonight and then I’ll come for your answer in the morning. Good night. Boy, would you call me a taxi, please? Yes sir. [scream] What's that? Miss O'Dell! Miss O'dell, what's wrong? Something startled me, Mr. Spottswoode, but I'm all right now. Are you sure you're all right? Yes, quite sure. Run along home and come back in the morning. Very well then, I’ll see you in the morning. Good night. Driver, the club. Yes sir. [sneeze] Say fella, what’s the big idea you coming in here late? Me late? Yes you late. I been here for an hour. I don't want that stuff. I beg your pardon. Mr. Spottswoode calling on Miss O’Dell by appointment. She don't answer. Has she's gone out do you think? I've been on all night. And you haven't seen her go out? No sir. That’s funny. Do you suppose she can be ill? What we may go and knock. Yes yes let's do this. [knocking] Miss O'Dell? Miss O'Dell? Are you ill? No! What's the matter? Something has happened. Go get your passkey. Yes sir. Yes sir. Say fella! Just gets running and get a cop! And say, get a big one too! Here, you better let me have that. What's the matter here? Something has happened in there, officer. You better take that key and go in. She's dead. Police headquarters, please. Patrolman Cassidy speaking. There’s a woman dead at 184 West 71st Street. It looks like murder. Okay Cassidy. She’s been dead since midnight, Sergeant, strangled to death That long, eh? Sergeant, the district attorney just pulled up and he's coming right in. That's great. He's got that Mr. Philo Vance with him. Well, that'll be just dandy. Sherlock Holmes on-the-job again. Heads up, boys. Morning, Sergeant. Good morning, Mr. Markham. Well hello, Mr. Vance. How are you, Sergeant? Fine. Haven't seen you since the Green murder case. Quite right. Oh good morning, Mr. Spottswoode. Good morning, Mr. Markham. Well Sergeant what does it look like? Well Chief, just another clear case of robbery. All I can make out of it. Nasty business, Charles, eh? Oh terrible. As you know I was here last night to make my final appeal to her for Jimmy and when I came back this morning for her answer, this has happened. Yeah, they'll probably want to keep you here for a few moments Charles. Yes, I suppose they will. And by the way I explained to the district attorney on the way down about Jimmy and the girl here. Oh that's good. I'm glad you did that, Philo. You know, if I can tell you anything that will help... Well perhaps later, Charles. Meanwhile I'll have a bit of a look about. I don't think there's anything worth you looking at, Mr. Vance. It's a clear case - robbery. She put up a battle and they wrecked the joint. I see. As simple as that, eh? That's it. Well just the same, Sergeant, if you don't mind, I think I'll have just one little look. Surely Mr. Lance, go right ahead, make yourself perfectly at home. Thank you, Sergeant. Excuse me, mister policeman, when do we sleep? Now you get this, sonny boy. You'll go for a long sleep unless you button up that big trap of yours! Yes sir. Ah, Sergeant? Yes Chief? Any fingerprints? Well, so far no. I’ll tell you this job was done by an expert. Yes, perfect. Yes, that's just the trouble. What's that? It's too perfect. Well that's a little over my head, Mr. Vance. Just what do you mean by “too perfect"? Well Sergeant, what usually happens when a heavy lamp like that is knocked off the table? Well I don't know, but I'll bite. What does happen? It usually smashes, doesn't it? It might. Well look at that one. Well what about it? Well simply that that lamp was placed there to give the effect of a struggle. Maybe. Let me see Sergeant. It does look a little obvious, doesn't it, Vance? I should say so. Hey boy. What happened here last night after you heard Miss O’Dell scream and you and Mr. Spottswoode ran down the hall to her door? Well, she said she was alright and I called Mr. Spottswoode a taxicab. And you got away with it? Yes sir. What time was this? It's on the call sheet there I gave you, about 2-2-2-2... Never mind, I can read it. 12:10. Mr. Spottswoode, where did you go last evening after you left here? I went directly to the Stuyvesant Club. That's right, Sergeant. I met Mr. Spottswoode at the club shortly after 12:00. We played poker until almost daylight I believe, wasn't it? Must have been. I know it was long after 4:00. Oh yeah, you mentioned that coming down here, Vance. Right. That'll be all for the present, Mr.Spottswoode. Thank you, Markham. But if you do want me later on, Mr. Vance has my number. Quite right. Goodbye, Charles. I'll phone you. Go right ahead, boys. Go... Oh Sergeant, would you step over here for a moment, please? All right, Mr. Vance. What is it now? Do you observe anything peculiar here? Why surely! The key is on the inside! Excellent, Sergeant. Don't you think we might go over that knob for fingerprints? Well now... Oh I get you, Mr. Vance. The murderer locked himself in this closet. When Spottswoode left, he came out and croaked the Canary. No, I hardly think so, Sergeant. If you'll observe, this is the one place in the entire apartment that hasn't been disturbed. Now what does that signify? ...that and the fact that the key being found on the inside? Just as I told you. The murderer was in this closet and came out when Spottswoode left. I don't think you quite get my point, Sergeant. If the murderer had been in here, he would have upset this closet as he did the rest of the apartment. Wouldn't he? Well yes I guess he would. Precisely. Gentlemen, it was someone else who was in that closet while the apartment was being ransacked and that someone witnessed the murder through the keyhole. Splendid, Sergeant. And if you'll find who was in that closet, I think you'll learn from him or her who it was that killed the Canary. Sergeant, get the fingerprints,will you. Oh Joe. Oh Sergeant, you might check up on the other apartments. Mr. Vance and I are going outside. You, come here. Yes sir. Who lives in that apartment there? Miss Alice LaFosse. Isn't she the dame that had the battle with the Canary the other night over young Spottswoode? Ye-ye-ye... Alright, alright. Couldn't possibly get in here. I'd say so. Humph... Well, what is this? That's odd. Might prove interesting. What do you think? I see, Miss LaFosse, I see. but you and the Canary had a fight over young Spottswoode, didn’t you? Why yes. We did have a fight. You see, she took Jimmy away from me and got him into trouble. But that's all over now. Jimmy and I made it up just day before yesterday. You didn't see young Spottswoode last night, did you? Why yes. He brought me home from the theater. Aha, so he was hanging around here last night, was he? Yes, but he was with me until after 1:00... Now wait a minute, lady. Wait a minute. You save your alibis till we get you down to headquarters. Go slip on your things. Now look, you don't think... Put them on! Mr. Vance, I'm frightened. Now don't you be worried, Alice. Just you do as the Sergeant says. Alright. You know, I'm beginning to question this robbery theory, Mr. Vance. You and I were right. Oh yes. Why I can see plainly that this murder is all mixed up in a love spat. You know Chief, I think we better round up this young Spottswoode and give him the works. What do you say? Quite right, Sergeant. Markham, I'd like you to add a few names to that list, if you don't mind. The men I mentioned on the way up here. Dr. Ambrose Lindquist, John Cleaver and Louie Mannix. Well, young man. What do you know about what happened at the Canary's apartment last night? Nothing. But look here, sir. That has nothing to do with Alice... I mean Miss LaFosse. The papers say the Canary was murdered before midnight and I tell you we were together the whole time. It isn't fair to hold her. You haven't the right. Now Jimmy, don't get worked up. Everything's going to be all right. Why not interview the others first, Markham. Very well. Gordon, take Mr. Spottswoode out in the other room and hold him there. I'll talk to you later, young man. Be off. Well, who's next on the list? Mannix. I'd like to make a bit of an experiment, Markham. Have you a pad and pencil there? Yes. There you are. Do you have that newspaper handy? Yes, right here. All ready? Alright. Morning, Mr. Vance. Good morning. Mr. Markham. Good morning. Will you please take a seat? Thank you. Sorry. Mr. Mannix, there are a few questions I'd like to ask you. Questions? What about? I don't know anything about this. It was a great shock to me! What was a great shock to you? Why, I thought perhaps you were going to ask me about the Canary. Yeah, exactly. You read my thoughts, Mr. Mannix. Did you ever see that necklace before? Why, why yes! Fact is I gave that to the Canary. A little token of esteem. Nice girl, the Canary. I'd met her once or twice, mm-hmm. Casual acquaintance. Rather an expensive gift to give it to a casual acquaintance, isn't it? Do you know that the Canary was strangled that necklace? Most remarkable. Unfortunate, I should say. Where were you last night between 11:00 and 1:00? Between 11:00 and 1:00? Yes. Let me see. Why I was home. I went to bed about 10:00. Oh, tired out. You understand. Pardon me, Mr. Mannix. Any comment to make, Mr. Mannix? Odd habit of mine, drawing triangles. Mr. Mannix, if you were in your bed last night at 10:00, how did you manage to drop that newspaper just outside the Canary's apartment? And that edition isn't on the streets until 11:00. Well, you've caught me. I'll tell the truth. It's always best to tell the truth, especially when there's no reason to lie. It was like this. The Canary called my home at dinnertime last night. Most embarrassing. Mrs. Mannix was with me. I had admitted to tell my wife about the Canary. She wouldn't have understood. The Canary told me that she was going to be married and wanted to see me. Said that I should come to her apartment at 11:00. Well I,,, I couldn't argue over the phone. The missus was listening. So I said alright. So at 11:00, I went to the Canary's apartment. I entered the hall by a side door. I went directly to her apartment. I was about to enter when I heard voices inside. I listened. It was a man in there. He was arguing, of course. Well, there was no place for me. So I returned home without seeing the Canary. or entering her apartment. Well that'll be all the questioning for the present, Mr. Mannix, but I'll have to ask you to wait in the outer office. I may want to speak to you later on. Oh won't you let me go home? I'll get an awful mess with my wife. I’m sorry you'll have to wait. Oh Mr. Markham, I wouldn't run away. Millfield. That'll be all. Mr. Markham, you've gotta help me square this with my wife. We will now have Mr. Cleaver. Good morning, Mr. Cleaver. Good morning, Mr. Markham. Can I do anything for you? Will you please have a seat? Mind if I smoke a cigar? Please do. Mr. Cleaver, do you mind if I ask you some questions? Why of course. If I can be of any help. Where were you last night between 11:00 and 1:00? Motoring up the Hudson in the moonlight alone. So I don't see what that has to do with the District Attorney's Office. Well only this, Mr. Cleaver, if you were indulging in the nocturnal beauties of nature along the Hudson last evening, now how does it happen that this cigar band bearing your initials was found just outside the Canary's window at an early hour this morning? Well if I was passing the Canary's apartment, you can't twist that into a crime. Oh then you didn't pass her apartment? Why, yes I...I've nothing to hide. About dinnertime last night the Canary phoned me. Oh of course, my acquaintance with her was holy in my line as social reformer. I'd hoped that she was going to leave her immoral life and marry or settle down. Be a good woman. And you kept the appointment? Yes, yes and no, I was a little late. I arrived at her apartment about quarter to 12, or thereabouts. I waited for a minute outside her windows to light a cigar. Then I jumped down to the side entrance to the building. But who should I chance to see but Dr. Lindquist. He was behaving in a very peculiar manner. Seemed to me very queer, very mysterious. I didn't like it. So I made up my mind not to see the Canary again. And I turned and walked back home. Let me tell you, I'm a busy man and I hope you'll excuse me. I'm very sorry, Mr. Cleaver but I'll have to ask you to wait in the outer office. I might want to question you again. Mark my words, Markham, you'll be sorry for this. Well, I'll take my chances, Mr. Cleaver. A charming fellow, that Cleaver. Yeah, rather. By the way, Vance, I didn't see you pick up the cigar band in front of Canary's apartment this morning. I didn't. Where did you get it? From your wastebasket. Waste basket? Cleaver dropped it there when he entered. I took a chance on his not remembering that. It seemed to work. Well I'll be.... Very good. Dr. Lindquist. Come on doctor... I can't be... I caught Dr. Lindquist just as he was leaving town. It’s a lie! It was a grateful patient... Won't you please sit down, doctor? I’d like to ask you a few questions. Doctor, where were you last night between 11:00 and 1:00? None of your business. It is some of my business. You were seen coming out of the Canary's apartment at midnight. I never... Not so fast, doctor. Calm yourself, doctor. Sorry, I lost my temper. I'm under a terrible strain. I loved the Canary dearly. And... and I be upset. Do you know that the Canary was strangled with that necklace? You, you don't accuse me! But Dr. Lindguist, there's really no need for you to be excited. Now Mr. Markham here is merely trying to find out what you know. Know? Know? One moment, doctor. Markham, don't you think that we might postpone the interview with Dr. Lindguist for a while? Why, what... Very well. That'll be all for the present, doctor. I'd like to have you remain in the outer office. Come on, doctor. What was the idea, Vance? We had him where he was about to tell us everything. Well, on the contrary, Markham. In his present extremely excited condition, I very much doubt if he would have told us anything. I do think, however, that if we give him a chance to cool off a bit, he's very likely to tell us the truth. Well, perhaps you're right. Good morning, Sergeant. How are you, Sergeant? Good morning, Chief. Hello Mr. Vance. Take a slant at those. There is the Canary's jewels. They were found in an ashcan about a block from her apartment this morning. I guess that kind of disproves the robbery theory. We were right, Mr. Vance. Hmm? I say, we were right. Oh, oh yes, yes apparently we were, Sergeant. Now it's up to us to find another motive. Yes, quite right, Sergeant. You know, Markham, I've been thinking this over all morning and I believe that I can come pretty close to the psychology of the man who committed this murder. I believe that I can pick him out from that list of suspects, if he's among them. However it will require a bit of an experiment. And what is in your mind? Well, I'd like to use that conference room of yours there for a friendly little game of poker with your suspects. Well now, that's a cute idea. And just what is your idea then? Oh just this, Markham. A man's true nature always comes out in a game of poker. Now I know the type and the temperament of the man who murdered the Canary. And in the game of poker, I believe that I can come pretty close to putting my finger on him. That's a new way of catching crooks! Maybe it's not, will you, please. Oh go ahead, Vance. The experiment can do no harm. Quite right. Now I'd like to have the Sergeant tell them. Well I'd be very glad to help you, Mr. Vance, as long as don't try to hang the murder on me! Sergeant, will you take Mr. Vance's orders please? Okay Chief. Will you get me a deck of card and have some poker chips handy just outside there. That's easy. Then bring in the suspects and impress upon them that they may be detained here for quite a while, possibly two or even three hours. Well that's okay, Mr. Vance. But how are you gonna get these suspects into this poker game without it appearing phony to them? Sergeant, I rather think that the power of suggestion will take care of that. Oh, our suggestion. Exactly. Now Sergeant, look in from time to time and when I pull my handkerChief from my pocket so, break up the game by telling them that they're all free to go home. Understand? I get you. But when you release them, I'll have my boys tail them. Very good, Sergeant. And Mr. Vance, here's to the power of suggestion! Jimmy. Well gentlemen, you're liable to be here for two or three hours, perhaps longer. That's outrageous! Just make yourselves at home. Well, you know this is gonna get me in an awful mess with my wife. That is of no interest to me. Sorry. What's the idea, Mr. Vance? Well, what are they going to do with Alice? Now Jimmy, don't you worry. Nothing is going to happen to Alice. Mr. Vance, you know this is gonna get me in an awful mess with my wife. Martha... My wife's a wonderful woman and all that but sometimes she just doesn't understand me. The last time I was little indiscreet, it cost me a fur coat. Hmm okay. I hate to think what this is going to cost. But don't you think it's a... Beg your pardon. I'm sorry. Mr. Vance, you haven't got an extra pack of cards, have you? I'm sorry, Mr. Mannix, but you're welcome to these. No, no thanks just the same. I wish we could play a little cards. Say, that's a good idea. How about poker? I'm agreeable. What about the others? Dr. Lindquist? Anything to pass the time. Mr. Cleaver? Well, as a rule it's against my principles, but I suppose on an occasion like this, one can relax such rules. Just draw up a chair, gentlemen. Thank you. Sergeant, how about some poker chips? Surely. Chief? Yes? Mr. Spottswoode is here. Let him in. Come in, Mr. Spottswoode. Good morning, Mr. Spottswoode. Good morning, Markham, good morning. I say, Markham, what are you holding Jimmy for? Surely you're not accusing him. Oh no, of course not. We're simply trying to find out what he knows, that's all. Well yeah yeah. Where is he now? Why, in the other room there with Vance. May I see him? Why certainly. Mr. Vance, Mr. Spottswoode is here. Oh, hello Dad! Hello, Jimmy. Hey good morning, Charles. Good morning, Philo. Dad, what are you doing here? I came to be with you, Jimmy, while you're detained. Oh, by all means. We've just started a little game of poker here, Charles. Would you like to join? Come on, Dad, sit and take a hand. Well alright. House to the end. I'm fine. Suppose you take that chair, Charles. Thanks. Gentlemen, this is Mr. Spottswoode. Mr. Mannix. Dr. Lindquist. And Mr Cleaver. How do you do? Shall it be jackpot, gentlemen? Why yes, anything. Yes the missus and I usually play jackpot. Cards? Three, Mr. Vance, please. Thank you. Cleaver? Two, please. So it's between you and me, Mr. Cleaver. Yeah. I'll bet a white one. Oh, so you're calling me. Yeah. Well, just openers. Pair of jacks. Three aces. So you called a one chip bet with three aces. Open. I'm out. How many, Mr. Vance? Two cards, please. Mr. Mannix? I think I'll play these. I’ll check the bet to you, Mr. Mannix. Calling. 9-8-7-6-5... and they're all spades. You bet on a sure thing, Mr. Mannix. I open for one. I'll stay. Oh, let's make it a little more interesting. Ten more. Well, that let's me out. I’m out. And me. I'll stay with you, Charles. Cards, gentlemen? Three to me. One-two-three. Mr. Spottswoode? I have plenty. Mmm... A white stack, Charles. Two white stacks. Up to chips, Charles. Oh, you want me to do the betting, eh? Alright. I'm afraid I'm overcome by curiosity. What have you? Two deuces. They're good. They're what? Well, why the philanthropy, Philo? Well I had 8-high. Pardon me, Mr. Vance. Could I speak to you a moment? Excuse me, please. We've traced the fingerprints… …in the closet and saw the Canary murder. Gentlemen, here is the man who was in the Canary's clothes closet and who witnessed her murder. Hmm, well I shouldn't like to be the man he saw. Thank goodness he didn't see me through the keyhole. So that man witnessed a murder. Singularly unattractive countenance. Well, if he knows, why doesn't he tell who did it? Gentlemen, I have been instructed by the district attorney to inform you that you're all free to go home. Thank goodness for that! I wonder what the wife will say. Has anyone a fountain pen, please? There's mine. Thank you, sir. Now what I didn't tell you about this bird, Mr. Vance, in front of the others, is that he phoned in and said that he'd be in the district attorney's office tomorrow. Spill the whole works. He says that he saw the guy that croaked the Canary. And that he'll come in tell us who it was. Now we haven't been able to locate him yet, so I guess we just have to wait. Well Sergeant, that takes the matter out of my hands. Markham, there can be no doubt of it. The same person who strangled the Canary, strangled Skeel. This new murder was done to cover up the first. Skeel was obviously blackmailing the Canary's murderer. He threatened to inform the police of what he had seen through the keyhole of the closet. And when the murderer learned yesterday at the poker game that the police knew who had been in the closet, he put Skeel out of the way at the earliest possible moment. I believe you're right, Vance. Oh, come in. Did any of the suspects get away from your men last night? We never lost sight of Lindguist. Mannix, and the girl. But young Spottswoode and Cleaver gave us the slip. That will be all. Right Chief. Vance, that means Jimmy and Cleaver. Morning, Chief. Morning, Heath. Boys. Hello, Mr. Vance. Good morning, Sergeant. Well Chief, everything is okay. I've got the guilty man and I've got him right. You've got him? I'll hope to tell you I have. Where is he? All right, Mac. Bring him in. Mr. Vance. Jimmy. This fool arrested me this morning at breakfast for the murder. Why... It’s just like shooting fish in a tub, Chief. I've got all the dope and I've got it down pat. Motive and everything. Now this dame Alice croaked the Canary. Jealous, because she'd stolen her fella. The kid here bumped Skeel off to shut his mouth and to protect the dame. It's a lie! That isn't all, Chief. I've got the evidence. And it's not psychology, Mr. Vance. Mr. Vance, he lies. He hasn't any evidence. He couldn't have. Just a minute, Jimmy. Sergeant, what is your theory? Well, I don’t go on theory. I use cold facts, Mr. Vance. Now you wait a minute. Did you ever see that pen? Yes, it's mine. You bet your life it's yours! Take a look at that pen, Mr. Vance. Chief. Well. Now listen to this. This morning I found that pen on the floor there by the table where Skeel was murdered. And the kid here admits that it's his! Well, young man. What have you to say? Yes, I killed them. Both of them. Well, I guess that does it, Chief. We've got him in a sack. Now this dame Alice... Wait a minute! You got what you wanted. Now, take me off. Take them away, Max. Well, I’ll see you later at the office, Chief. Alright. Sorry, Mr. Vance. Well Vance, I guess that closes the case. No Markham, it doesn’t. What do you mean? I mean that the boy is not guilty. Well that's nonsense! Not nonsense, Markham. Because I know who is guilty. Come now, Vance. I tell you, Markham, I know! And inside of one hour, you'll know too. I'm going to telephone at once... to the real murderer and have him come to the Canary's apartment. And I want you to be there. The boy has confessed everything. Markham, if you don't meet me there, you'll be the laughingstock of New York in 24 hours because I'll have the confession of the real murderer. Well, all right, Vance. If you want it that way, I'll be there. Number, please. Bayview 2-1-2-1. Bayview 2-1-2-1. Yes, please. Ah, this is Philo Vance. I want to speak with... Oh hello, Philo. How are you? I didn't recognize your voice. I've something of extreme importance to tell you. Jimmy has just been arrested. He has confessed to the murder of both the Canary and Skeel. Do you understand? Yes, I understand, Philo. Jimmy is not guilty. I am the man you want. How soon will you meet me at the Canary's apartment? It'll take me almost an hour to get in from the country, but I'll be there. Good. [train horn] [crash] It's been over an hour now, Vance. Don't be impatient, Markham. He'll be here. Who is it you're expecting? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. And I must admit that without his confession, I haven't a shred of real proof to offer you. [phone ringing] Hello. Yes. Ah this is Mr. Vance speaking. What? Yes. All right. What is it, Vance? Spottswoode has just been killed in a motor accident. Spottswoode killed? My sympathies, old man. I know what great friends you were. It's worse than you realize, Markham. It was Spottswoode who killed both the Canary and Skeel. Spottswoode? I've known it ever since the poker game. But how could you know? Sit down, Markham. It wasn't really so difficult. Remember, the man who committed this particular crime must have had certain definite qualities, a mind capable of working out a well-planned and brilliant cause of action, willing to take a desperate chance and see it through. Now consider the men in the game. Jimmy I ruled out at the start, But I've known him as a boy and his youth and impulsiveness were hardly consistent with such a... such an obviously premeditated murder. Lindquist was far too excitable and erratic to have plotted such a carefully calculated crime. Cleaver, much too cautious and entirely lacking in the necessary boldness. Mannix, timid and unwilling to take any risk except upon an absolutely sure thing. The only man at the table with enough imagination to plan such a crime and with sufficient self-confidence and daring to carry it through was Spottswoode. When he held a pair of deuces, refused to draw to them, and bet every chip he had on the chance of bluffing me out, a realization suddenly dawned upon me that he was the murderer. For he was the one man of them all psychologically fitted for such an act. But how about finding Jimmy's pen in the Skeel apartment? I borrowed Jimmy's fountain pen after the poker game. My hypothesis is that in the confusion, Spottswoode put the pen into his own pocket and that Jimmy saw him do it. That is why Jimmy made his confession, to shield his father. Yes, but against all that theory, Vance, we have certain definite facts. Now for instance, Spottswoode left the Canary's apartment while she was still alive. He talked to her through that door. The hall boy, looking through the keyhole, saw the Canary lying on this sofa smoking a cigarette. Spottswoode then went away and spent the rest of the evening with you. True, and yet I know he committed the murder. And I've got to find out how he did it. I'm afraid you will, Vance. But Jimmy can go free. Spottswoode himself was coming here to tell how it was done in order to free Jimmy. Now he's dead. I've got to solve it. I think I have the whole thing. Now follow me closely. The Canary was lying there. Spottswoode, let us say, was standing here making a final plea for his boy, which met but an absolute refusal. He walked around to the head of the sofa. Suddenly he clapped his hand over her mouth. And with his other hand, caught her necklace. And before she had a chance to cry out, he strangled her. He then proceeded to set the stage to make it appear that the crime had been committed with robbery as a motive. He stripped her jewels from her and placed them in his pocket. Then... he took a cigarette from that box and lit it. He laid her hand here. Placed the cigarette between her fingers so that in case anyone should look through the keyhole of that door there it would appear as if she were lying here smoking. He then overturned the entire apartment to make it look as if a burglar had ransacked the place. Now just step over here, Markham. He came to this closet door but he couldn't open it. Skeel had locked himself in, though Spottswoode didn't know that. And Skeel, through the keyhole, saw everything that Spottswoode did. That accounts for the orderly condition of this one closet, but everything else in the apartment was ransacked. And that, Markham, was the technique of the crime itself. But that doesn't account for the fact that... Just a minute. I haven't quite finished. I want you to go out into the hall and stand by the desk where Spottswoode stood when he ordered his cab. Very well. [scream] Something startled with me, Mr. Spottswoode. But I'm alright now. Yes, quite sure. Run along home and come back in the morning. You understand now? This record was Spottswoode's alibi. Undoubtedly, the reason he returned here the next morning was to get it back, but he was prevented by the arrival of the officer who entered the apartment with him. The Canary was dead. And the scream issued from the apartment that night, she was dead when she apparently spoke to Spottswoode through the door. But what clue led you to the phonograph record? It was this magazine. That is hardly a magazine the Canary would have read. So I concluded that someone else must have brought it here. Then in running through the pages, I happened to notice this. Look closely. You see it? Oh yes, the imprint of a large circle. And on the opposite page? Why, the same thing! Precisely, as if a disk had been pressed between the two pages. That brought to my mind the thought of a phonograph record. And suddenly the whole plot became clear to me. It was the only way that Spottswoode could have committed the murder and have produced a voice in the apartment after the Canary's death. I can't understand how he could have reproduced the Canary's voice. It wasn't the Canary's voice, Markham. Spottswoode made that record himself. Probably it was his own voice in falsetto. And remember, it was only necessary to fool the houseboy, and through a closed door. Yes, I can see it all now. He played the game, shrewdly and boldly. It was Jimmy's whole life's happiness that was at stake. And Spottswoode risked his own life for his boy. Goodbye, Mr. Vance. You'll never know how grateful we are. Goodbye, my dear. I wish you great happiness. Oh, thank you. Goodbye, Jimmy. Your happiness will come. Thank you, Mr. Vance. I can't any more, just now. Well, Mr. Vance. Well, Sergeant. I guess we put it over again. Right you are, Sergeant. Many thanks. Well I'll be seeing you later. Goodbye. Goodbye, Sergeant. [Music]
