Hurry up! I'm going as fast as I can. No, you're not. You're milking it to piss me off. You're so paranoid. Come on. Whoo! Slow down! Come on. Whoo! Baby! How's it handle? Steering's mushy, front end alignment's soft, and RPMs are running a bit hot. My God. You're such a nerd. Pull over, I want to drive. Forget it. I stole it, I get to drive it. Come on, Em. You always get to drive it. But this is really fun. - Crap. - Just pull over. It's okay, it's okay. We'll be fine. We're in a stolen car. It's fine, okay? Trust me. I've talked my way out of worse situations. Don't worry. There's something I didn't tell you. I don't actually have my driver's license. What? My mom wouldn't even let me take the test. She's scared I'll die in a crash. Em, my God. Are you kidding me right now? I've got possible suspects. What do we do? Hang on. Hey! Hey! Hey! My God. Holy crap. I don't see them. Em, where are we going to go? Hang on. That was awesome. Yeah, I'm glad you liked it, because we are so not doing that again. Yeah, right. Where have I heard that before? I'm serious, Max! No more joyriding. Okay. Jeez. Bite my head off. Can't a girl just have a little fun? I'm sorry she's still in pieces, Dad. Parts cost money and minimum wage sucks. Maybe you should ask for more shifts. They can barely afford to keep me on as it is. Maybe you should look for a better job. I need a car for a better job, and a driver's license. Nice try. Is there something you want to tell me? Like how awesome of a mom you are? It's a school night, Em. I'm sorry, I lost track of time. Yeah, right. Well, I don't know where you and Max go every night but a little bit more focus on the future wouldn't hurt either of you. Come on, don't you have homework or something? I already did it. All right. Well, just call next time so I'm not worrying. Deal. Anything else? Yeah. Get your butt in bed, it's almost 11. Miss Wheeler, can I have a word? What? First of all, you can drop the attitude. Second of all, you're supposed to be on the machine press today. You have a project due, remember? You said I could do engines first. When you're done your other work. By the time I get back you better be well on your way to a lawn dart, young lady. Lawn darts, really? What a prick. He just resents the fact that I'm a better mechanic than him. Really? Are you? You've been here for what? Two days? So I forgive you for not knowing that. I see. So you think you're the queen of this little ant farm? What do you say we... we prove it to you? Be my guest. You're sure you're up for this? Bring it, new guy. Okay, neither of these cars can start without a key. On your mark, get set... hotwire! Yeah! That's the stuff! Keep going. Keep going. Car. How the hell did you do that? Powered the starter. All right. Thanks. - I'm Dylan. - Emily. Nice ink. You like? Got that my first week in juvie. So that's why I haven't seen you around. Yeah. Not my finest six months. Six. What'd you do? Rob a bank? Do you really have to ask? My God. Is this where tires come to die? How did you even find this place? An old friend of my dad's recommended it. You can find any tire you want. Yeah, well, the only thing we're getting here is the evil eye. Hi. I called about the '70 Dodge Charger. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We got that. - You sure you don't need two? - I'm good. - All right. - Yeah. Here you go. Yeah, cash only. I don't have enough. Can you spot me? I'll pay you back as soon as I get to an ATM. Em. Thank you. All right. God, this place is so weird. - I love it. - Of course you do. Stevie. You got it, you got it. Em! Hey. - Cool. - Pleasure doing business. Thanks. - You got it? - Yup. What? The VIN number from that car was missing. So? So that's illegal. I think that car was stolen and they were stripping it for parts. Stop. You think Homeboy's running a chop-shop in there? What do you want to do? Go get our money back? No. It'll be twice as much anywhere else. Let's just go. You sure you don't want to drop off a resume? Funny. Ha-ha! Hey! I'm so sorry I'm late. The bus driver wouldn't wait for me and then I had to take a cab and there was traffic. What? "Things are tight"? Really? You're like her best employee. My mom will be happy. She wanted me to get a better job anyway. Like what? Stocking boxes? Maybe you could scrape gum off of the bleachers at school. Okay, it's not like I have a lot of options. I'm making a point. Working more of these crappy jobs isn't going to get you anywhere. You want me to go back to that chop-shop, don't you? Yes, I do. I can't steal cars for money. We're already stealing cars for free. Why not get a little more out of it other than just a good old lady boner? Come on! What's the worst that can happen? We're underage, which means we're practically untouchable. If they catch us, we go to juvie for a few months and, you know, say hi to your boyfriend's friends. Big deal. Okay, he's not my boyfriend. Not yet. Can we do this? Just let me do all the talking, okay? And please, take the stick out of your butt. I don't think I heard y'all right. I think you did. You trying to play me, girl? We're just trying to do a business deal, that's all. You need inventory, and let's be real, you don't really care where it comes from. We can help with that. As long as you're willing to cut us in. Y'all either real stupid or cops. And I know y'all ain't no cops. Right? Show 'em, Em. Where is she going? Just watch, okay? No, hold up. No, seriously, just wait. Girl, do your thing. I ain't got no time for all of this, man. Trust me. You're going to want to see this, okay? This is my shop. You understand that? - Just give her a second. - So get you girl out of there. I ain't got no time. We should talk about money. We were thinking a flat fee of $500 per car to start. What do you say? Yeah. Okay. Hit it, girl! Let's see how fast this one can go! Push it! Whoo! Honey! Dinner. Wash your hands, okay? - Soap. - Be right there. How was school today? I don't know, it's school. What do you want me to say? Well, how's the car coming along? Spending a lot of time in there. I think I'm going to have to rebuild the engine. Sounds expensive. Not really. I can get cheap parts. For a car like that? Where? Scrapyard. Scrapyard? I thought the point was to fix it up. You don't know anything about cars, Mom. That was your father's area of expertise. You know I'm not trying to punish you, right? Could have fooled me. I just don't want you growing up thinking that the only thing that matters in life is how fast you go from zero to 60. Do we have to talk about this right now? - We never talk about this. - You never talk about it! Dad dies in a crash and suddenly I'm not allowed to do the one thing I actually want to with my life. It's not fair, Mom. Yeah. Maybe it's not. And maybe you're right. Look, I've been doing some thinking. I... I'm going to let you take a driver's test, but I do not want you driving too fast. And as long as you get straight A's this semester. - Mom. - And not just in shop class... Or industrial arts. Why do grads matter so much? You and Dad went to community college. Why do you act like if I'm not on the honour roll, then my life is over? Because your father wanted the best for you. He didn't want you living in the past, in his past, obsessed with this damn car. Em! Em! I didn't... It is an impressive presentation. Your words. You know, cars are, um, they're my passion. Well, the passion is certainly on the page. Well, I'm glad you think so. Unfortunately, I just don't see how exotic car rentals can generate enough income to make sense on a balance sheet. I... I hear you. I do. Um... I know that the margins are not much, but if you take a close look at my estimates you'll see that I've put a lot of thought into this and... I ran the numbers, Mr. Curnow. So did I. So did I. I... Many times. I ran them twice. And I'm... I'm sorry but with your credit history... Hold on now. I'm working on that credit history. That's something... I'm in the middle of fixing. With your current credit history, I... I just don't see how I can help you. And to be frank, I don't know of any bank that would. I appreciate you time. - Your artwork, Mr. Curnow. - Yeah. Throw that in the trash. Sure you want to do that? Do what? Walk away from me? Are we flirting? 'Cause I've been away for a while and I'm a little rusty. What do you think? I think if you're not doing anything Saturday night, maybe we could hang out. Is that a yes? Emily was so good. She hotwired the car. Absolutely amazing. Look at Em, she was going so fast. I swear to God. Mr. Curnow, I'm sorry. What is so funny that you can't watch where you're going? I wasn't a part of it. You got this, Em! Whoo! - Go back to class. - Okay. Sorry. Six stolen cars over two weeks, all within a five mile radius. We've got a new gang of car thieves on our hands. You're joking, right? Is it really that bad? Em, I know the military thing is your look but are you sure you want to wear that on a date? It's not a blind date, Max. He's going to go blind if he sees you in that. What time is he picking you up at? Actually, I'm picking him up. In what? You don't drive. No, you didn't. Thought I may as well make use of it, right? Okay, I mean, picking up a rando ex-con's not really what I had in mind, but... he will love you in that. Cute, right? Pfft. Nice ride. Going my way? So there's a rumour going around school that you don't have your license yet. I don't. ♪ And how much time ♪ So, this is it. My favourite spot. Pretty cool? Yeah, it's beautiful. So, you like to drive fast, Emily Wheeler? I like speed. Gives me freedom. - Freedom? - Yeah. From... school, my mom... life. I like to be the only one behind the wheel. So you like to be in control? And what you have... an obsession with cars? It's more of an addiction. Yeah, I've been down that road. And I'm going to take a wild guess that this isn't yours. Nope. Then whose? I didn't get their name. Wow. I thought you'd be impressed. Look, you get that I was in juvie for auto theft, right? It's okay, I'll have you home before you turn into a pumpkin. Emily, it's not a joke. All right, screwing around in shop class is one thing, but actually boosting cars, that almost ruined my life. Okay. I didn't know you felt that way. I'm sorry. Please just tell me this was a one-time thing. It was. It was just a one-time thing. I promise. Hey. 'Kay, you were lying, right? About not ripping rides anymore? - Yeah. - Obviously. Okay, good, because Nestor just texted me like, a list of stuff he needed yesterday. So, let's hit it after school, okay? Okay. No, there's no way. You always get to drive. 'm driving my own car. - Fine. - All right, let's go. Stop the car. That's the one. Wait here. Okay. Hurry it up. Mr. Curnow? Hello, Max. What are you doing here? I would ask you the same question but I think I know the answer. You going for a joyride? It's my cousin's car. He left his keys inside. I was just helping him. Save your breath, Miss Wheeler. You can either talk to the police or you can talk to me and I think you'll be a lot more interested in what I have to say. Max, you're going to take me to my car and then you two are going to follow me. Didn't know you were a farmer. Nobody farms anymore. Been trying to sell this dump since my Pop kicked the bucket. So what are we doing here? Coming to a mutually beneficial arrangement, I hope. We already have one of those. Let me guess, you two boost cars that are easy to steal, yeah? Your silent partner pays you a pittance while turning around and making a mint stripping them for parts. How'd I do? Ladies, that is a sucker's game. There are bigger fish out there; much bigger. We're not interested. Maybe I wasn't clear. Either come and work for me, or spend the rest of your teen years making licence plates in county lock-up. Maybe we should hear him out, Em. Listen to your friend. I already know what he's gonna say. He wants us to go after luxury models. That is exactly what I'm going to say. But those cars all have that smart-key system thing. I thought they were, like, impossible to steal. Not impossible. Just risky. With great risk comes great reward. You're talking about a relay station attack? Yes. Yes, I am. What's a relay station attack? That is a good question. Smart keys use RFID. Radio frequency identification. It is the same tech that allows you to buy anything with the tap of a credit card. Now, the trick is making the car think that you are the owner. So, how do we do that? You need two people. Miss Wheeler is correct. Allow me to demonstrate. Let's say that you were the owner. Miss Wheeler, you will be our thief. Take this. Come with me. Stand here. Now, in order to trick the car into thinking that Miss Wheeler has a legitimate key, I have to get close enough to you to ping your fob with this. The closer, the better. Disco. Once I've captured the car's unique signal, I then transmit it to my accomplice. Press the button. Go ahead. There it is. Allowing her access to the vehicle, yeah? Hop in. Now, since most new cars have keyless ignition as well as keyless entry, once you're past the security system, starting the engine is simply a matter of pushing a button. Go ahead. Yeah. So, what do you say, Miss Wheeler? Are you ready to play in the big leagues? - That's it. - She's a beaut. Okay. Who's going to do this? Rock, paper, scissors? Okay. All right. Here you go. Thank you. I can do this. Okay, okay. Very well. How are you? - Good, thank you. - Reservation this evening? Yeah. For two. - Under what name? - Under Williams. Mina will show you to your table. - Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. 'Evening, folks. Reservations for McDonald, please. Come on. Come on, Max. Come on. Please work. How can I help you, ma'am? Hey, excuse me. Which way is... Just a second. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. I'm sorry. My lunch date actually just cancelled. Yes! It worked! Now, this? This is a car. Glad you're happy. Where's our money? As soon as I land a buyer, you will get your cut. That wasn't the deal. Yeah. What are you trying to pull? Don't do that. I'm not trying to pull anything. Do you think that I'd be doing this if I had that kind of cash lying around? You get paid when I get paid. And ladies? I see a lot of empty space here, right? A successful business needs inventory, right? Now is not the time to rest on our laurels. Now, help me cover this up. That right there. Get these, in good shape. What? Something came for you. Parts for your dad's car? Yeah. Express delivery from Canada. That can't have been cheap. Couldn't find it anywhere else. You can afford that on what they pay you at the mall? - I asked for a raise. - Really? 'Cause you said they could barely afford to keep you on. I'm doing some extra work for Mr. Curnow, my industrial arts teacher. - What kind of extra work? - Farming. - Farming? - Yep. He has a farm. Out on Gibson Road. I mean, it hasn't been used in, like, ever. So, me and some other kids are clearing out some junk and cleaning it up. There's an old racer, too, so I've been helping him with that. And, yeah. He's giving me extra credit. So, he's giving you extra credit and enough money to buy rare parts for a vintage Dodge Charger? Okay, Mom. Look. I should have told you earlier. - Yeah. - I'm sorry. Listen. Can I go? I have a trig test to study for. Yeah. God. - Hey. - Hey. How you doing? Door was open. Thought I'd drop by. Hope you don't mind. No. Of course not. So, this is your baby? Yep. That's her. And you're gonna restore her all by yourself? Well, my dad always said we'd do it together. He's gone, so... Yeah. Mine wasn't around much, either. But hey, at least you had him in your life as long as you did. - Yeah, I guess. - What's the package? Parts. Cool. You want help installing them? Um, you know, you really don't have to do that. Well, I want to. I appreciate the offer, but... Look. I thought things were going well with us. They are. All right, well, I know my way around an engine, so what's the problem? It's just something I have to do myself. Does that make sense? Yeah. Totally. Um, well, how about I take you out tonight? I told my mom I have to study. Okay. After that? It's a school night. I'm beat. Okay. The weekend, then? I promise I won't help you with the car. Well, me and Max have a thing. A thing? What thing? A girl thing. Yeah. You guys are really attached at the hip? I know, and I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you. I promise. Okay. Well, I will see you later, then. I'll call you. Okay. That he, embraced. And every single line that he wrote... Is to know the AABBAA... Where the hell are you two? I been hearing rumours, and not the good kind. Hit me back when you get this. Mr. Baines? Detective Torres, auto theft division. Can I have a moment of your time? All right. Catch you guys later. Dylan? Nice to see you again. Detective, what... What are you doing here? I just wanted a moment of your time. Can we chat? Sure. Yeah. Principal Moss tells me you've been adjusting well. That's good to hear. Hey. No one is happier to be out than me. I believe it. So, why are we having this conversation? I've got a problem. I thought you might be able to shed some light on it. What kind of problem? Someone is boosting luxury cars, the kind with rich and powerful owners who have pull down at city hall. You think I'm involved? Maybe. Not directly. We have witnesses who put the same teenage girl at three of the scenes. I believe she has at least one accomplice, also female, probably the same age. I don't know anything about that. Like I said, I really don't want to go back in. I bet you don't. Because the next time I catch you in the same zip code as a stolen car, it won't be pretend prison. It'll be the real thing. I don't know who stole those cars, detective. I swear to God. Well, then, I guess we're done. If you hear anything, don't hesitate to give me a call. Emily? Emily? Hey. Look. I need to talk to you. So, that car the other day, that wasn't a one-time thing, was it? - Look. Dylan... - Don't try and deny it. The cops just finished grilling me. They are on to you, Em. You and Max. - What did you tell them? - Nothing. But they have witnesses. What if they put you in a line-up? I mean, we're just guesses. You think that that matters? Man, you're so naive. Okay, look. It's not that simple. There's someone else involved. - Who? - Curnow. Industrial arts teacher Curnow? He found out what we're doing. I don't know how, and he's blackmailing us to steal for him. You got to get out now, before it ends badly. Trust me. I have to talk to Max. Mr. Curnow? - That's right. - Hi. I'm Gail Wheeler. I'm Emily's mom. I'm sorry to just pop by like this. Your secretary said you might be in. Come on in. What can I do for you, Miss Wheeler? Um, this might seem like an odd question, but do you own a farm out on Gibson Road? I have a few acres. Why do you ask? My daughter said that she was working for you, I just wanted to make sure she wasn't full of it. Well, she's not exactly tilling the fields, if that's what she told you. Well, she mentioned she was working on an old car. That's right. I'm a, collector. Um, just more of a hobby than anything else. I don't expect to be making any... any money from it. I see. Well, speaking of money, can I ask how much you're paying her? What did she tell you I was paying her? Well, enough to buy expensive car parts, apparently. I'm sure you're aware of her obsession with cars? I am well aware. Your daughter is quite the mechanic. Truth be told, she's my best student. I'm only here temporarily until they find someone permanent, but she's my favourite. That's good to hear. It just doesn't answer my question. I'm sorry that your daughter is having trouble managing her money. I'm just not quite sure what it has to do with me. Well, I guess my concern is that she's spending a lot of time out there, and she might be neglecting her schoolwork. I would never let this interfere with her education, Miss Wheeler. In fact, she's earning extra credits. I see. I'm sorry. I've got to run. I've got a conference call in a few minutes. Can I walk you out? No, it's okay. I'm good. I insist. Just to the door. Okay. I appreciate you coming by and talking to me. Well, it's nice to finally meet you. Absolutely, absolutely. Enjoy the rest of your day. - Okay? - And you as well. No. No? If they were onto us, they would've brought us in for questioning already. Well, you really want to take that chance? Look, Max, I know this detective. She's a hard-ass with half the judges in the state on her speed-dial. You guys will be tried as adults. This isn't just about a few months in juvie anymore, Max. We need to talk to Curnow. Maybe he can do something. - Like what, Em? - I don't know. Damn it. If we had just stuck to the original plan... Low-profile cars, selling them for parts... We wouldn't be in this stupid mess. Look. We just need to tell him that we're out. Just there. Thank you. You two are hard to track down. - Who's this? - The original plan. - I don't know you. - It's okay. He's cool. It's not okay. Get lost. You tell him about me? No. And what about this mystery man that you been boosting cars for you? You tell him? We don't know what you're talking about. Shut up. Now, I thought you were smart. I guess I was wrong. You getting way too ambitious. Bringing heat down on my business. I can't have that. Okay. We didn't know, so... What did I just say? Here's the deal. Now, listen carefully. It's a one-time offer. Stop what you're doing. Go back to your sock hops and sleepovers. And if I hear that you've been dipping your pretty little toes back in the pool, I'm going to chop them off. You understand? My God. Damn it, Em, we really need to talk to Curnow now. Okay. Let's go. Em. What have you gotten yourself into? Miss Wheeler. If you're looking for Emily, she's... She's not here. Yeah. She, um... She didn't come home. I just... figured she was with you. I got it. You know, folks around this way don't take kindly to people traipsing around their property uninvited. I'm sorry. Or peeking where they shouldn't. No. I didn't really see anything. Not even my collection? Yeah. Well... Must be expensive. Not if you know the right people. Like your daughter, for instance. So, what is she, your... on-call mechanic? More of a partner in crime. I'm just going to see myself out. - Get... - Don't move. Relax. We're just going to have a conversation inside, okay? Okay. Anything? Curnow's still not answering. Seriously? We've got to figure this out, Em. I know. I'll just keep trying. I'll call you later, okay? Okay. I love your taste in cars. Dukes of Hazzard changed my life. What are you doing here? You are not the only one who knows how to bypass a security system. I've been trying to call you. I know. I got your messages. So, you know about the police? When you steal this many luxury cars, you're bound to attract attention. And you're okay with that? Well, by tonight, my lot will be empty and we will both have an extra zero in our bank accounts. There's just one more thing I need you to do, and then we can go on our separate ways. I can't. Our silent partner found out what we're doing and he's not letting us work for you anymore. Well, that's not my problem. You don't understand. This guy is serious. What makes you think that I am not? He'll kill you. He'll have to find me first. - I'll tell him where you are. - No. No, you won't. Not if you want to see your mother alive again. What are you talking about? I caught her sniffing around my home. What the hell are you thinking, telling her that you were working for me? I had to tell her something. She was getting suspicious. Well, congratulations. You just put her life in danger. - What is this? - That is your last job. Bring me that car by tomorrow night, midnight, and you will see your mother again. And what makes you think I'm not just going to call the police? You mean besides the fact that she will die and you'll go to jail? Nothing. Nothing at all. That's the Hummer. What's the big deal? We can totally steal that. No, no, no. The big deal is whose car it is. That's Staxx's, and he loves that car. Who's Staxx? He's the owner of Live nightclub, and no one messes with Staxx. He's connected. Okay. How bad can he be? His name has two "x's" in it. No, Max. You're not listening, okay? No one steals from a guy like that unless it's some sort of vendetta. It's suicide, okay? You have to walk away. - I don't have a choice. - We could call the police. She's my mom. I'll do it myself if I have to. Em, you're my best friend. I'm not just going to abandon you. But it's my fault you're even involved in the first place. Are you kidding me? I basically had to drag you back to that chop shop. Yeah, but if I hadn't been so good at... All right, all right. I get it. You're both amazing and you're both to blame. Let's start working on a plan. Okay. How do we find him? Easy. His nightclub. Dylan, you can't be a part of this. What? Look. Em, I know I'm just the idiot that got caught and went to juvie, but I'm your boyfriend. - I'm going to help you. - It's not that. The police could be following you, and we can't afford to tip them off. If you really want to help, you'll stay as far away from me as you can. So, basically, I get the hardest job. You'll manage. All right, but I'm backup, okay? If something happens, you call me. I will. You be careful. I will. Just heard back from the surveillance team. Our boy's got company. Two females. High school age. Where? 6861 Mervis. The house is owned by a Gail Wheeler. Has one daughter. Emily, 17. It's her class photo. It gets better. Her father was Jason Wheeler. Won a couple of mechanics' jobs. Died in a street race six years ago. That's our girl. Tell the team to sit on all three until I get there. Got it. I'll handle this one. What happened to rock, paper, scissors? She's my mom. I'll take the risks. Fine with me. What do you mean we lost the girls? What part of "sit on all three" did you not understand? We took separate cars, we couldn't follow both of them. Put out a BOLO. I want those two in an interview room by the end of the night. What about Felt? Let's take him down. No. Damn it. We need to map out multiple escape routes and we need to buy a new look. Em, we're fine. We just plan it out like we always do, okay? Don't worry. Hey. We must have been under surveillance. Which means they know who you are. - Who is it? - It's Dylan. Put it on speakerphone. Hey, Dylan, what's going on? Give me this. Is this Emily Wheeler? This is Detective Torres. Your little joyride is over, Emily. You and your friend need to turn yourselves in right now - before someone gets hurt. - My God. I know you're listening. You're a smart girl. Don't end up like your father. Emily, I did not sign up for this, okay? It's over. I mean it. No, it's not over. It's not over. - Emily... - It can't be over. - Wake up! - No. What else are we supposed to do? - They know where we are! - The only thing to do! We stick to the plan and we finish this. Are you with me? How do I look? 21? You look hot, that's enough. Okay, good, because I am all out of fake IDs. You're gonna be fine. Okay? You've got this. - Good? - Yeah. Good. Okay. It's my phone charger. Go ahead. Now would be a great time for this to work. I can do this. Excuse me, does anybody have the time? The time? Nobody has a phone or a watch or anything? Honey, for you, I've got all the time in the world. Why don't you sit down? Thanks anyway. Now, now, don't be rude. Sit with us. Have a drink. What's your name? Um, what's yours? Friends call me "Staxx." First name "Big." I get it. You look nervous about something. Doesn't she look nervous? Come on, Em. Come on. Don't worry, honey. You don't have to be scared. Play your cards right, I might even show you my car. Sounds rad. Women and their purses... What you got in there, anyway? Crown jewels? Nothing. Just girl stuff. Ask your friends, they know what I'm talking about. Hey! Give it back! What the hell? Hey! Stop her! Stop her! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Follow that Hummer. Go. What happened in there? He got a little friendlier than I planned. You actually talked to the owner? Jesus, Em! Like I had a choice! Okay, pull over. I want to drive. No way. You always get to drive. Em? Cops? Worse. I think that's Nestor. I warned them not to mess with me. Come on, let's go, let's go. Push the whip. Get me closer. Come on. Pull over! Pull over! Pull! Over! My God, Em! He's got a gun! What do I do?! - Lose him! - Okay. Great. Cops now, too? Seriously, Max, you really need to let me drive. Well, what do you want me to do? It's not like I can just pull over. Hold it steady! God. My God. Damn. Yo, move out. We lost Nestor. Just checked the Wheeler house. No one's home. All units be advised. Female suspects wanted on multiple counts of grand theft auto heading west at high speed on Charleston Avenue in a grey Hummer. So, what's the plan? The plan? The endgame? Don't worry. Your daughter will be here soon enough and you'll never have to see me again. That's a relief. The feeling is mutual, believe me. How much are you making on this deal, anyway? A lot. My buyer is very committed to owning this vehicle and he is not the kind of man you want to make unhappy. Why? Is your buyer a crime boss? Actually, yes. And it just so happens that your daughter is stealing from a local thug who pissed him off. Relax, Gail. Emily can take care of herself. Assuming my daughter comes through for you, then what? You don't seem like the strippers and coke type. If you must know, it's seed money. For what? My future business. Which is? Exotic car rentals. I'm thinking somewhere warm. Maybe Florida. Costa Rica. You think it's... such a good idea to be telling me this if the plan is to let me go? You're not planning to let me go. Are you? I could use some ideas here! - Run! - Run?! Hey, stop right now! Emily Wheeler! Maxine Bing! Stop! Come back here! Money in the bank. I think you're getting a little ahead of yourself. It's nearly midnight. She's still not here. If I were you, I'd be thinking about plan B. Do me a favour... Stop talking. Yeah? Or what? You'll kill me twice? I didn't say that I have to make this quick. Is something funny? You, high school teachers breaking bad... It's such a cliché. You won't think it's funny when your daughter is the one with a gun to her head. Yeah? Okay. Yeah. This was a great idea. It's almost midnight. We have to move. I hate to break it to you, Em, but we just lost our only bargaining chip. Curnow doesn't know that. I got no eyes. I'm gonna check over here. Okay. So, what do we do? Nothing here. Flashpoint down, man. Hey, we know you're there! No. There's no way. Beggars can't be choosers. Come on. Okay. How about this way? A stolen Hummer has been abandoned near the neighbourhood of Ferndale, and two female suspects wanted on multiple counts of grand theft auto are still at large. SIU executive director Heather Douglas has confirmed the suspects are known to police, but their identities will not be released to the public at this time. A third suspect in the case, Nestor Barnes, has been arrested in connection to a major local chop shop and may face hundreds of felony charges. In breaking international news, heavy rains and flooding have killed at least 12 people in Jordan and forced authorities to evacuate. Lights over there. Get those lights to the back, please. Em? There's someone coming. How much time do I have? Um... I don't know. Like, 20 seconds maybe. Em, he's gonna catch us. Hang on. Come back here! We are so going to jail. Who is it? I don't know. Hello? Hey, Em, it's me. Mom! Where are you? I'm at Curnow's farm. Okay, listen to me. Don't come here, okay? Whatever you do. - What? Why? - Because he's gonna kill you. Listen, just go to the police and tell them everything. But... Just do it, okay? - Mom? - She hung up. - I can't just leave her. - I know. What? How the hell did they steal your car? Everyone, mount up! Right, copy that. Let's go! Move out! Move out! Okay, let's just calm down and think about this for a second. You don't really want to do this. Your daughter just cost me a lot of money. Maybe my life. Believe me, it makes it easier. I-I promise I'm not going to tell anyone about this. Nope. No, you will not. He's not picking up. She said he was going to kill her. Do you think he already... No! He still wants the Hummer, right? If he kills her, he gets nothing. Yeah, right. But we don't have the Hummer anymore. Damn it. How are we gonna get him to let her go? Come on. Come on. You don't need me, okay? Can you just please let me go? You're already ahead of the game, right? You've got money. You can leave the country. Do I need to gag you? - No. - Good. Get in the car now. There's a house. What do we do? He's a convicted felon and we're the police. We can arrest him. Do it. Get out of the car! You better do as she says. This isn't right. Let me try. Okay. Um... You heard her. Get out of the car and put your hands above your head. Do it now. Max, you son of a bitch. Mom?! Mom! That's far enough. Em, I told you not to come! You should've listened to her, kid. Leave her! Freeze! Drop the gun! You okay? Up. Never thought I'd hear that sound again. Nice paint job, Em. Dad would be proud. Even though I dragged the family name through the mud and had to do community service for a year? Helped put some bad people in jail. If he's happy with it, so am I. Your mom is so cool. My mom has me grounded for, like, the next ten years of my life. Aren't they expecting you down at the scrapyard? You're gonna be late for work. It's okay. I'm dating the owner's son. - Hey. - Hey. - You ready to go? - Yeah. - Let's take my car instead. - What? You mean...? No way. Passed with flying colors. Well, I'd expect no less. Hey, um, can I get a ride with you guys, perhaps? Thanks. Remember what I said... One speeding ticket, this car goes out on eBay. I know, Mom. Bye.
