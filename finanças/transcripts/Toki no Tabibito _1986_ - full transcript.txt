Where am I? Where is everyone? Remy, stick close or we'll lose you. Where are we? Who knows? Where are we going? Can't say. It's nothing new for us. The Time Étranger Several days ago, the six crossed the desert and came upon a city without a name... Where... am I? Where? Oh yeah, that hotel in the city we found. I got a single room... Now it's coming back. No water again? This is no planet for girls! Wonder if the others are up yet? And the criminals who robbed the City 13 branch of the Three Mark Bank at 2:20 continue... their flight from justice in three air cars containing their hostages and 3.4 billion in gold bullion. All city express ways have been blocked off, with civilian traffic barred from access. Because of this, city traffic is backed up for 5 kilometres, with no relief in sight. The criminals are believed to be carrying heavy weaponry, leaving the patrol cars in a cautious pursuit behind them. Had to happen today, didn't it? What do I do? I'll never make it at this rate. And the express ways are practically empty. That's right, I don't have much time left. To hell with this! Let's go! Sorry. Stop! Hey, stop! What the hell? — What's that? — Freeway ticket. At least he's not trying to sneak a free ride. What the hell's the matter with you? After him! License plate reads: S-E-E, Y-O-U, A-G-A-l-N. Got the owner. "Remy Shimada." A woman! Remy Shimada. Travelled space as a member of the Goshogun Team. Winner of the Galaxy Award for Valour. Refused acceptance... Great technique! You think she'll give me her autograph? Kinda doubt it. Doesn't look like she even likes getting her picture taken. This photo's pretty old. — A woman of mystery. — You think so? She turned down the Galaxy Award 40 years ago. 40 years? You mean... The Remy Shimada driving that car is over 70 years old. Outta the way! Come on! Gimme a break, will you? I'm just in a hurry. I don't have any beef with you guys. I was going to get a good price for this thing! Okay, if that's how you want it. One down! And the next one... We got the perps and recovered all the hostages too. Damn, what a woman! Swell. Better put out that fire on my ass. I guess I'm not going to make it. Look out! Mama. Where is this place? Where am I? Mama! Mama. Who's the kid? Remy. Didn't I tell you not to come here? But... But... She's yours, huh? Gonna be a real looker when she grows up. Get away from her! She'll never have to sell herself! What the hell're you doing? Time's up. Pay and get out! I ain't comin' back! Remy, Mama has more work to do. Buy something nice for yourself, and wait for me at home. That was the first and last time mother ever gave me pocket money. One chocolate crepe... and ten sweet broiled chestnuts later, it was gone. I don't even remember how they tasted. And there was mother's death not long after that. These are the only memories I have left of her. We meet again, Shingo. Yeah. God, Killy. 40 years. I'd forgotten how long it's been. Want one? No smoking in the museum. Since when do you smoke? The day we stopped fighting... was the day there stopped being any point to not smoking. And now Remy's 40 years older too. Jesus, you mean the two of you never got it together in 40 years? Look who's talking, you second-rate Casanova. There was never anything between Remy and me. To my eternal regret. We never had anything either. What a couple of jerks we are, wasting poor Remy like that. Only ones left are his royal Bundle-ness and the other two. Looks like those three won't be coming today. But, Remy, what would make her call us here now? I dunno. Anyway, she's late. She has no relatives? Yeah, and her house is locked up, like she was a hermit or something. What about her hospital expenses? No savings account at all. But she won the Galaxy Award! Can't the government cover it? Well... She never accepted it. She hasn't had anything to do with the government since then. Health insurance? Defaulted on the premiums. So who's going to pay for the treatment we've already given her? At 6:30 will be dinner with the president of the All World Banking Union. You'll be discussing financing for the coming year. At 7:30 will be a party hosted by the Fishery, Agriculture, and Industrial Unions. They request you make a 20 minute speech. President's office. Sir, phone call for you. — From who? — A hospital, apparently. Hospital? Yeah, what is it? What? Hospital costs? We've gotta company health plan! Just... What, she isn't? Why the devil should I pay for someone who isn't in my company? This isn't a damned charity I'm running! Galaxy Award? Woman who turned it down... Cancel everything on my schedule tonight! But there's a round-table meeting with the President after the party. I don't care! Yes, sir! Remy's been in an accident. Closing time. End of show. Curtain falls. You'd drop the curtain before the heroine's entrance? Mr. Shingo Hojo and Mr. Killy Gagley? Yes? I've a message for you from the president of Kernagul Fried Chicken. Ms. Remy Shimada cannot join you today. In here. How is she? The examination revealed a problem... in addition to the wounds she received in the accident. Progressive Leuko-Isolation Syndrome. Leuko-Isolation Syndrome? If we'd known about it earlier, we could have done something. Look here. It's spread throughout her body. As it is, she has a five percent chance for recovery. — Here. — Thanks. Taking the accident into account, I'd say she has two days left. Two days? You just said she had a five percent chance! Yes, if we got hold of a specialist at the City University Hospital. But relations between the Central Hospital and the University Hospital aren't that great. And her injuries are very serious. If we moved her, she'd die within the hour. Then call the guy at the University Hospital. Now! Stop it! Don't kill him! He's the only hope Remy has. The walls between hospitals are thicker than you'd think. It'd be different if we had an order from the Surgeon General. Surgeon General? The Surgeon General! What's with you? Our Surgeon General's a man that the big-wigs on the Federation Council know pretty damn well. — You don't mean... — Exactly! Mr. Caw-Caw Crow! The joker we accepted the Galaxy Award with. Where is he? Christ. Why does my job have me end up... bouncing around these god-damned mountains? Christ. Sun and moon are like travellers moving for a hundred generations to and fro. Time passes unconcerned, the starlight unchanging. Making the darkness tonight all the more beautiful. The taste of Shadojima style somen noodles is pleasing to my palate. Yet I find the slim but firm Miwa style much more suitable. With Welsh onions the only seasoning. Bundle. Somen isn't much of a meal by itself. You should add some fried egg or ham to it. At least I'm not eating cold Chinese food. Don't be like that. We're both getting old. And that means we have to eat well and learn to cooperate. Here, just sign this. — That being? — The title to this land. I shan't help a corrupt politician evict me from my own land! Don't be like that! Despite what you think of me... I am the Surgeon General! I want to turn all this into a public health resort. It has to be developed. So hey, be a pal, Bundle. The mark of development is not suited for this plot of nature. Leave this place. If you don't... Alright! Alright! Christ, if you weren't an old friend, I'd bulldoze this shack. — You'd what? — Nothing! Nothing! You've got good ears for a man your age. Ah, hell. I'm the one going deaf lately. Yeah, hello? I'm kinda in the middle of something right now. Remy Shimada? Yeah, yeah, I know her. What? She's in critical? You need my authorization? But I'll never make it down from these mountains in two days! Cuttnal. Leave this to me. The city's only 50 minutes away at supersonic. Sword and sabre alone are not enough in today's world. This, too, is a requirement of the samurai. Even with the rain, it isn't any cooler. Probably why the guys haven't come out of their rooms. A locket with no one inside. Everyone gets tired of being alone eventually. Shingo? Killy? Kernagul? Cuttnal? Or is it you, Bundle? — Yes? — Here. This is for you. Thanks. Wait, who sent this? In two days, you will be dead. That is your destiny. How you will die is shown within. "In two days, you will be dead. How you will die..." Get that specialist at University Hospital now, god dammit! Tell him it's an order from the Surgeon General! — Thanks, Cuttnal. — You've saved her. W-Well... I don't think she'll be able to pull through. Remy's condition is deteriorating as we speak. Even with the operation... I only give her a one percent chance for survival. — One percent? — Jesus. No. Remy defies the odds. Her will to live itself has always been a thing of beauty. Even now, surely... What's wrong, Remy? Don't you want it? Just take off your dress. We'll buy it from you. Alright! Remy's gonna strip! Thanks, friends. I'll just take this for my cleaning bill. See ya. This will be you in two days time. You will die in the most shameful of ways... ripped apart body and soul by strangers. A baptism of blood awaits you. Thanks for the warning. What's that? Did I forget to turn it off? Real cute. I don't mean to scare you, but I need to know something! What are the guest room water pipes connected to? — The water tank, on the roof. — Thanks! Remy, don't shoot! No one's up here. 'Cept us, that is. Nothing but water in there. Blood! Blood! I hate having blood running all over the place! Oh, you guys! There isn't a drop of blood up here. You saw it too? We all got those bloody love letters. Someone apparently wants us all dead. A baptism of blood, eh? I'd rather prefer one of fine wine, thank you. Those who receive the baptism will surely die. You, in two days. No one can escape their destiny. That's her! She's the one who stole my money! You little tramp, how dare you! I'm taking you to the police! Where is this? Where am I? I understand your situation. But it wouldn't do to raise a fuss over this sort of thing. "This sort of thing"? Quickly vanishing baptisms of blood... and letters of fate are common things in this city. Like hell, common! You don't see that much blood in boxing or pro-wrestling! When death draws near, everyone here receives... a letter of fate and the baptism of blood. They then pray to God and prepare their souls. Correct. No man may change the fate God grants him. Even strangers like yourselves. Poppy-cock! My medicines have saved lots of peoples' lives. I've changed peoples' fates! Look out! You see that? He saved me. Stuff that in your "letters of fate"! Your letter did not decree your death this day. Your destiny remains unchanged. Don't leave this hotel. Our people don't take kindly to people who defy fate. Sunset prayer is called. Come, we must pray to God. Now what? He told us not to leave. Making that option all the more appealing. I was starting to go stir-crazy in that room, anyway. Let's chase the blues away. I'm with you. Like the old woman said, I'm supposed to die in four days. Five days for me. — Three for me. — Four. I see no point in keeping a tally. Looks like I'll be the first to go. Good. I wouldn't want to see any of you die, anyway. We won't let that happen, Remy. I've never had anything in my life and I'll be damned if I go out that way. Or Remy, especially. I say we blow this burg. With Remy, of course. Thanks, guys. Aw hell, lighten up! Cheers! Cheers! 'Tis still too soon to harvest this lovely rose. We have no mercy for those who defy the God of Fate. Whoa, guys. Aren't you a little early? Your fate will not change. You will not die. No matter how badly we beat you. I gotcha. Sorta like a divine carte blanche. Well, we can cut loose without worrying, then. As extreme as always. The only ones fated to get beaten are you guys! I haven't danced in ages! Let's make a hot day hotter! Why be violent? You alright? Have some medicine. My special sleeping aids, that is. Pardon me! Hope I didn't disturb you. Not at all. A forte was appropriate at that point. Your playing just makes me want to kick up my heels. Thanks. Wait! We're here to protect you! Clear out, rioters! This is insane! You're cops, and you act like that? We protect the citizenry from rioters. I suppose that this was their "fate"? Exactly. As you have your own fates to meet. Until then, stay in your hotel. For the sake of civil order, at least. Don't worry, we're leaving your happy little city. There is no "outside" to this place. You're now one of us. No one can escape this city. Just as no one can escape his destiny? As you say. The whole city's our enemy. And somebody's pulling their strings in the background. — That thing they worship? — Probably. Do we take it down? There is no beauty in a hopeless battle. — Then we run like hell? — Running's nothing new to me. This will be you in two days time. Disgusting! You can't kill it with bullets. I said you couldn't. No, look at how you will die. Fine, I'll look. It's your own foolishness I see. I don't know who you are, but you won't win! Yes, that's the way. You can't win. Just wait two more days. Remy! Use the knife! Thanks, Killy. You're at least a century ahead of these jokers. But why are you here? You tipped us off when you jumped out your window. You always did like to do things solo. We figured you could use our help. Listen, Remy. Just for once, let us protect you. No arguments. Look, I like to pull my own weight. If you survive... then maybe Mr. Fate over there won't look so tough. And maybe I'll still be alive in three days. Killy. We're all together on this. — Looks like they followed us. — Yeah. This gun's too big for rapid fire. If you shoot too much, you'll hurt your hand. I know, but I'm used to it. Okay, get going. I'll handle things here. But... No, no, no. Not a word. Remember, I die in three days. Catch you later. See you again. Get away! Remy! Now's your chance! Get up here! — Shingo! — You can say "hi" later! These things aren't human. We can't use normal tactics. Where do they keep coming from? How long do you figure it'll take them to get up here? Much as I'd like them to take their time... a minute. It's enough. Over here, boys! Good job on your graveyard shift. Bye-bye! Tough luck, guys! Persistent, aren't they? Remy, run for it! I'll handle this! No way! I'll help. Don't be stupid and make this all for nothing! But... I'm team leader and that's an order! I guess old habits are hard to break. Go. Shingo. Thanks. This is all I'm good for, anyway. Better reload. Ow. Did I overdo it with the gun? I can't move my fingers. On bicycles, now? For Pete's sake! I think I'm starting to lose this little footrace. Well, considering I'm facing a pretty nasty death anyway... Remy! Get on! Any more fighting is pointless. Don't waste your ammo! Bundy! Cool bike. Where'd you get it? I borrowed it from the police. My natural abilities at work. Living up to your name, I see. Note: She jokes about Bundle's name (Bundoru) sounding like "to plunder" (bundoru) It isn't stolen, merely rented without the benefit of paperwork. We have to get you out of the city. The sooner, the better. — What about you guys? — We still have some things to do. The exit! And a big god damn welcome wagon! — They aren't attacking! — Let's go! That's... That's impossible! It'll be the same as many times as you try. You cannot leave this city. Your only escape is when the God of Fate... decrees that you sleep in that graveyard. You'd better make the arrangements. Yes, doctor. And keep it from that entourage of hers. Understood. No one's coming. No one's here. Right. No one's coming. No one's here. It's so quiet. Yeah. Mama's buried here too. Yes. Mama and I will be together. So I guess I'm going to die. You will. That was decided the day you were born. So this is it. Yes. There's no escape from this darkness. It was decided from the beginning. Tomorrow's the day. At least I got water today. It'll be tomorrow. You'll die. Are you ignoring me? No. You wouldn't let me even if I wanted to. But it's time for little girls to be in bed. Just take your precious pet and go home. You will die in agony! Nighty-night, little girl. Seven rounds, huh? I doubt I'll even manage to get off six. An empty locket. Hate to see it go to waste. In the end, it's always this one... And in the end, I had nothing. Nothing at all, no matter how I looked at it. The Autobiography of Killy Gagley: The Bronx Wolf. Volume one, tenth revised edition. The End. Hell, it'll never get past one volume anyway! Nothing more can be said. The glitter of this blade, polished to perfection, is a beauty which never fades. People are no different. You know, I was pretty good with my hands when I was a kid. Used to build plastic model kits I'd steal from stores. My family was so elite that I didn't have many friends. I built lots of super alloy model kits. Purchased, of course, with my American Express gold card. I miss those days. Being a kid. I miss... Our common interest. Gloomy. Don't squawk! On sheets of red, I turn Turn on the old merry-go-round On this night alone, tonight Half-forgotten thing My dream merry-go-round I climb aboard and fly away Eyes filled with loneliness With a tear ready to fall I wait for my gentle someone A half-remembered song Fills my ears And it sounds to me Hey, need a lift? Just like a lullaby Same as it always was We're giving our little project a test run. Free rides to anyone going to a creepy enemy cathedral. Our midnight merry-go-round Round and round it goes, tonight All aboard! Back then, oh my angel Full speed ahead! Making small talk with you My heart pounding as I... My body's so cold. So cold. Yes. Your sleep has come this far. It doesn't seem right. Just dying like this. There's nothing you can do. Just give up. This is all you could have expected from your life. Yeah, I guess you're right. Adieu, and farewell, Remy. Adieu, whoever you are. Don't give her that "adieu" stuff! Yeah, he's right. Who's there? Who? Well, you haven't met us yet, but there's a chance you will. You're one of us! One of you? But I don't have any friends. Not friends. We're all alone, like you. So you're one of us. You're all alone? I've never had anything since I was born. No parents, no brothers or sisters, or even a house with lights in it. My parents died when I was little. Right now, I'm in a military school, studying how to be a spy. So I don't have any friends. We all live in different places, all of us alone. But we think we might meet someday. Of course, we don't know for sure if we will. Will I really meet you? Who can say? But we're here now. Will you play with me, whoever you are? That's why we came. What do you mean, "you've called the hearse"? It's almost time for it. Can't you do anything else for her? This hospital is here to serve the living. 200,000 people a day get sick or injured in this city alone. We can't waste a bed on a terminal case for even one hour. The dead have no business being here! And I have final say over making a life-or-death call. That's the law of this city. Isn't that right, Surgeon General? It's hopeless? The Grim Reaper's knocking on the door? I give her 30 minutes, at best. But there's still a small chance! Yes. There's no point in isolating her any longer. You can go in if you want. — Here they come. — These guys just love to race. Why, you... — We're going in! — Strike team, up top! Gotcha! Here we go! It worked! Go fly up there and give 'em a hand. So, you've made it this far. Whatever you do won't change anything. You cannot escape from this city or your destiny. Really? If we can't leave, then we'll just destroy it. Then we'll survive. Cuttnal! Do you read? Yeah? Oh, Bundle! How's it going? It's time. Let them have it! All right! Kernagul! Time for the real show. While the kids were showing off to Remy for the past two days, we were doing our own thing around town. Destroying the city will change nothing. It exists only to give form to the fear of destiny. I'm changing mine! Nothing can be altered. It will be as it was that time. No one's coming. No one's here. So quiet. Yeah, I'm going to die. My body's cold. So cold. I may as well give up. This is all I could have expected from life. That's me? No. It's wrong! Something's different! What is different? Nothing can save me. I'm going to die. No, that's not me! Why? Why am I not you? You, who dares rebel against your own destiny... I hate you all! I wish you were dead! You cannot change your fate, little streetwalker! Damn. Can't shoot anymore. Remy, get a hold of yourself! — We're here with you. — Us, too! Remy, I never said what day my letter of fate gave me. I'll tell you now. It was yesterday. But I'm still alive. Remy. You can beat it too. Bundle. Do you understand? Don't give up, Remy. Be seeing you. I dunno what to say. Remy's catchphrase "See you again" seems appropriate. Why you overblown piece of... C'mon! Where are you going? Thanks, guys. We'll meet again. We haven't really, yet. But maybe, someday... Anybody down there? It's me! Remy! Down in there? I don't believe it. She's still alive! Remy, think back! To when we fought together. You never gave up, then! Hang on, Remy! I'd better go. No! I won't be beaten! Why does she fight it, even now? It's beyond me. Because she won't give up! No matter what. No one can escape from the pain The pain that comes from when they follow their dreams That keeps their wings hidden in their heart The only moment's peace you can find Is in the feeling when your bodies touch As they lay dreaming, now Just this one time Warrior! Those cobalt wings of grief are Always seeking the free skies! That's it. No more ammo. One shot. Still one shot! Before it turns to stardust Glowing crimson, shining Hold on to that dream, never forget it If you turn away, even a little From living your life as you've chosen Then at last you'll finally see Just what you're fighting for! Warrior! Those cobalt wings asleep inside your heart Awaken and turn to the sky Last shot. Make it count! I'm truly sorry. Where are you going? Fess up, Bundle. Pardon? You lied, didn't you? About your letter saying it was yesterday. You just said that so I wouldn't give up. Perhaps. You're alive, in any case. And after they even made a grave for you too. "Here lies Remy Shimada." No kidding. Bastards! Bang! You forgot. What? I didn't lose hope that time. As long as you stay alive, even if you haven't met them yet... even if you're not sure you ever will... you may find people who will be special to you. Really? Really. It's over. Yeah. Everything's over for us. Guys! Guys, wait up! I want to go with you. Beautiful. As I always knew you were. And somewhere in endless time, their journey still continues...
