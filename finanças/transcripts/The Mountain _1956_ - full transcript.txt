Early reports indicated that the wrecked plane has been located just below the summit of Bald Mountain, and rescue parties have been formed and planted to the site of the disaster. The airliner was on a routine flight from Calcutta to Paris. So far there's been no report on the possibility of survivors. - I thought you'd never get here. - It's a long drive. Which is Bald Mountain? There. Why? There's a plane wrecked on it somewhere. Really? Come, we'll have lunch. Good afternoon, sir. He's mr. Magnus, he owns the hotel. - Charmed. - Welcome to --, sir. Will you put the mademoiselle's luggage in my car and bring me the bill? Right away, sir. It's wonderful of you to drive all the way up here for me. - You're so considerate. - Expecially under the circumstances. - Am I too early or too late? - What does that mean? I've seen that look before. Many times. Haven't I? If you're going to be jealous of every man I have to talk too.. I'm too old to be jealous. Anyhow, it will make it easier for me to say goodbye. When I get tired of you and your... habits. I will say goodbye someday, you know? Maybe you'd like it to be now? I'd rather surprise you. You there. Boy. You amused mademoiselle very much during her stay. She wants to thank you for it. You didn't say thank you. Aren't you going to thank mademoiselle? Thank you. - Well, Zachary. - Oh, good afternoon, Marie. So you're back, are you. And with all the family, too. - And all in good health. - You'll give me the wool's spin, and we'll share the --, like the last year? - All right. Oh, and don't forget my roof. The snowes are coming and the shingles are cracked. You promised to fix it. - I'll come and fix it. Come Saturday. And stay over. We can go to church together on Sunday. - I don't know about that. - You can have the best bed. I've got a bed of my own. A man your age got to... sleep -- once in a while. Do you good. I wish you wouldn't keep talking like that. I guess it's no secret that I'm -- to you, Zachary. I'm -- to you, and everybody knows it. Well, I don't see how they can help you -- you keep shouting about it all the time. Well, I have never -- to say out loud. It's been five years since I became a widow. And I'm very good in being a wife but I'm not too good at waiting. Better get me while I'm willing. - And I'm willing. - I... You know I have my brother to look after. You can not keep on being father and mother to him all your life. And in case you wondered about it, you're not getting any better looking as the years go by. I don't know why I waste my time with you, anyhow. - Will you or won't you, Zachary Teller? - Well, I ... I don't know about marr--I don't know about getting married and things like that. I'll teach you everything there is to know. - It's not going to take forever, either. - I don't know. Somebody's coming. I never saw as so many cars as today. Don't forget about my roof! Got a whole series of pictures. Fairly clear. NSG for survivors. I went in at 15.000, it was below me, but I say the other two -- 12.000 feet. Hello, Zach. What's going on? An aeroplane crashed on the mountains last night. One of those big ones, with passengers. - It's all smashed up, everybody dead. - Dead, all dead. It came all the way from India, they say. Imagine that coming all the way from India crashing here. Imagine that. Nothing there. All the way up there's nothing. Must have happened on the other side. - That's what they say. - They located it from the air. - Dead, all dead. - Hello, crash wagon. Hello, crash wagon. Do you read me? Over. What's all this? Well, there a whole lot of men here from the airplane for you. Most have moved at the school-house, having a meeting. At the school-house. They're getting up a rescue party to climb them out. - Why if there's no one alive? - Bring back the mail. You know, important letters and all like that. Whoever belongs to these sheeps, will you please get them out of here? Please. - They are mine. I'm moving them. - I'll help you, Zach. Thank you. Search plane gives a negative on survivors. - I say again. Negative. - Let me talk to them. Enlargements of the photos give us quite a lot of details along the crest, at least 12 passenger thrown out on impact and four bodies visible in the tail section. More coming on this. Over. CWU to emergency. We've organized the rescue party. We'll leave here this afternoon, in about an hour. We'll go as far as the glacier. The actual climb will start in the morning. Emergency to CWU. Understood. Over and out. Zachary! A plane crashed on the mountains, you heard about it? I know, the phoned the hotel, they want volunteers for a rescue party. They're having a meeting in the school-house. Listen, if they want people, you can ask them to take me. Oh, Chris, they want only the best climbers- You can ask, can't you? It's important to me. I have to be something, I'm tired to be nothing. Now go ahead, ask. - Excuse me, mister, please... - Sorry, I'm busy. - It's about the climbing party. - Thanks, but, uh... You better look after your sheeps. Leave the mountains and the people will know about it. Maybe you don't know it, but he climbed the mountain when he was 12 years old. - 12 years old. - He and his father. They were the first to climb the mountain. He's the only one that climbed it alone. The only. He's Zachary Teller? You've heard about me? Yes, dumb as I am I've heard of you. Come with me. The main climbing party will leave as soon as the rest of our equipment gets here. By night -- will be on the glacial here... and that will give us all--. Is anything all with that, Servoz? I told you, --, I don't like the route this time of the year. Oh, you there, Zachary Teller. Come up here. We thinking of climbing the north face. How big of risk is it? - The north face this time of the year? - I told them, it's a big risk. Well, it's been done, and in a single day. You've done it in a day in your time, haven't you? Well, it was the summer time, it's fall now, so it's winter up there already. Everything above 8.000 feets is snow and ice, except on the south face. We can go up that way. It's almost straight out. Straight out is best sometimes. We have to carry up some flies, a stretcher, radio, even a doctor in case someone left alive up there. Well, how about it? I'll take you, as far as possible. Well, how far is that? Suppose we get to a place and I say go on and you say no. When I say "turn back", there's no use going further. Well, that's not good enough. What about you? How about you taking us up? - I don't climb anymore. - You still talk, though. - Too much, maybe. - I think too much. For a man who won't get his behind off the ground, a lot too much. I just came to ask you a question, Nicholas. You want to lead them up the mountain, you'll need man. My brother would like to go with you. If you go with, Zachary, I'll follow you. That's no answer. I'm sorry, Zachary. You come with us. I don't climb anymore, you know that, Nicholas. - I never read it about him. - Why won't he climb? Is he some sort of coward? I'll call him back and you can ask him. Why did he stop climbing? He fell from the mountain three times. Each time was worse than the time before. The last time a man was killed. He has an idea about the mountain now and he won't go near it. He has an idea the mountain doesn't want him. Do you have any ideas like that? No. We'll -- the north face. - Servoz said no. - You know what it is. - That time you... - Two men died that day on that climb. - I was right not go any further. - Is not for you to make that decision when you were with Nicholas. - Now he holds it against me. And you won't do anything about it. Once it meant something to be your brother... but not anymore. They're going up to the first peak on this side with radio equipment so they can keep in touch with Servoz on the glacial. They're going up the north face after all. It's a good thing you're not going with them. I don't know why you wanted to go anyway. I had a reason. It doesn't matter now. More dead in the mountains. Nothing to do with us anymore. In the old days you'd have been in charge. - I don't need Servoz --. - And getting good money for it too. Not for that. You don't take money for a thing like that. Here it is. I knew I'd remember seeing it. Calcutta, India. That's where the plane came from, they say. And here it is, in the geography book. They've got funny looking houses. And those trees grow where it's hot. - Palm trees. - Palm trees, that's right. You imagine? That plane coming all the way from there and ending up here. Must be a long way off. Yeah, about 4.000 miles. 4.000 miles. And there's only two miles from here to the village. Imagine. The other end of the Earth. I used to teach you how to read this book before to head to school. - You didn't teach me much. - I didn't know much. Was 14 years old when I went to work. I was already a grown man by the time you were born and momma died. There wasn't much time to learn anything. Oh, I'm sick of hearing about how you took care of me and raise me up. I didn't ask to be born and I didn't ask you to raise me up. What's the matter, is something bothering you? I don't like being poor. And I don't like taking orders from people that call me boy and think because they give me a tip it makes up of whatever feeling --. I don't like being laughed at. I never laughed at you. You're to blame for it. We used to have money and it meant something being your brother. When I was a guide you used to take people on the mountain. It's all over now. Just because that Englishman got killed. I don't see what difference it makes, you both fell. You lived and he died, it's all a matter of luck. I was the one who fell and I pulled him with me. He was surprised. I remember. When I fell, I looked right into his face, he looked so surprised. Imagine, me, Teller, falling like that. The last thing in the world he would have expected. Me too, for that matter. I don't climb anymore. The mountain gave me his warning. He doesn't want me. That's just an idea you got. You got caught in a rock slide and of them hit you, and the truth of the matter is, you don't remember what happened. The mountain warned me. I don't climb anymore. Get out! They don't know any better, Chris. Those are the ones that lost their lambs. They're others hurt. I can't live like this anymore. Well, --? We need money. I got an idea. I went to see about it this afternoon after I saw you. It can be arranged. - What? - We can sell the house. I spoke to the people at the hotel about it, they're opening up a new ski slope below the first peak and they can use this place. Sell? You want to sell our house? - Sell it? - What do you think I'm talking about? But you can't... But this is our house. We were born here. You and me. Our father, and his father... Look what it says. Placed here by the hand of Jack Teller. 1763. With the help of God. It's his house. He build it. It isn't ours to sell it... - Listen! You're always reminding me about how I was born and Mama died. And before she died, she said "His name is Christopher, take care of him". - That's how it went. - Then take care of me! Do what I say, sell the house, I have to have your permission, Zachary, now give me your permission! No. What do you mean no? Maybe now you'll see I mean it. I mean it, I'm gonna sell the place. Takes a long time to sign the papers. A month, maybe less. - You'll change your mind. - I won't change my mind! - Well, as long as we have time... - You understand? - Do you realize I wanna sell the place? - I understand. - And you say yes? - I say no. - I'll ...! - Don't do it, Chris. Don't ever hit me again. What are you going to do, Chris? I'm going down the village to get drunk. Christ, now, don't go get you drunk! Chris, listen. Don't, don't, don't go, Chris! Christoph! Maybe we can talk some more, Chris! Maybe we can think of something! Chris! Chris, come back! It's not good when you get drunk! I can't hear you! Servoz. Servoz is dead. Servoz... is dead? He's dead, Zachary. On the mountains. They said so on the radio. The rescue party is coming down with him now. Down the glacial. - Happened early this morning. - Oh, Servoz. He was somebody. We often went up together. He was a good man. Listen, they're bringing his body down now, it said on the radio, you want to come with us to meet them? - How did it happen? - I don't know, they didn't say. Do you want to come with us? - I don't understand it. Man doesn't just fall, they were roped together, I... Something must have happened. Well, you know Servoz did't want to go up that way, everybody knew it. They'll be angry. Maybe you better come with us. Zachary! Do they know what happened yet? Only that he fell into a --. His wife is taking it very bad. We'll go up there to meet them. Did you see my brother? He was at the cafe all night, somebody said. - He's still there. - Is he drinking? - He didn't go there to talk. - I can send somebody for him, if you want. No, not if he's drinking. - They're nearly off the glacial - I can see them. Watched them all morning while they were climbing. Rocks falling all the time. You were right about that north face. Servoz didn't want to go that way. They had no other choice with all that equipment to take up there. Maybe you saw how'd it happen? I would like to know how'd it happen. - How did it happen? - It wasn't anybody's fault, Zachary. - I'm asking to him. - Yes, you have the right to ask. We're up beyond the --, above the glacier. The level is off a little, a lot of --. - I know the place. - We are crossing a snow bridge. Three men on a rope. Servoz was leading. It broke under him. Who was second on the rope? I was. I was at the edge of the break when I saw him fall, and I just had time to -- in my ice axe, but not enough. Some jerk on the rope pulled me over the edge. I hung there with the axe. I was losing my grip. The third man couldn't hold both of us. Servoz was below me, swinging back and forth, and looking up. I guess he could say I was slipping and cut the rope. He knows what he wanted to know. There's nothing to say. They were good friends, he and Servoz . - You radioed in? - We got a full report. We're packing, ready to leave. They ordered us to abandon and search for the plane. I thought they would. This is a tough one to lose. No signs of live, no survivors. The plane'll still be there next year. Wasn't right from the start. We're close to winter. We'll come back in the spring. Servoz ... Where were you? -- to Servoz. - You've heard about it? - Yes, I did. You want something to eat? Here. Zachary, take a look at this. You know what that is? It's a picture. -- stupid. Oh, listen, don't be mad about last night, forget about last night. This is important. This was taken from a plane that -- the mountain. It's the wreckage of the plane that crashed. Look. Look, you can even see the bodies. - Thirty feet higher and they --. - I know that place of the mountain. I thought you would. Don't you think Servoz would have done better by taking the mountain's south face? They were carrying too much gear to go up that side. You climbed the south face eight times. Could have been climbed at this time of year? The rock would still be alright, without too much ice. It could be done, then. Is it possible to reach the wreckage of the plane? I don't think so. Otherwise those people wouldn't have given up. If anybody could get them up there, it would be Servoz. I wasn't thinking about Servoz. I was thinking about you and me. What do you mean, you and me? Well, we could get up there, just the two of us. We could reach the wreckage alright. As long as we didn't take more gear than we actually need for a climb. But why would anybody want to go up there? There's nothing there but corpses and broken things, mail... It will all be there next year, they'll send another party up in the spring. You remember I wanted to go up with Servoz. And those people at the airfield, why do you think they were so anxious about getting up there right away? Everybody in the hotel was talking about it. - The plane was carrying gold. - Gold? Gold, a whole -- of gold for England. A whole lot of it, somebody said. You mustn't believe everything you hear. Think about the passengers. Even if the plane wasn't carrying gold, think about the passengers. Everyone of them must had money with them, you have to be rich to travel in an airplane. What's it to us -- ? We could take it from them. - Take money from dead? - What good is it to them? What could they buy with it? By next spring there won't be anything left of it. The snow and ice will have destroyed everything. We can't let all that money just lie there until it's lost. -- -- . If we don't go up and get it all, somebody else will. All that stuff up there doesn't belong to anybody, Zachary, is just there. Let it stay there. If we got that money, we wouldn't have to sell the house. You could even fix it up the way you've always wanted to. You can build a new stable, you have more sheep, 50 or 100 head, maybe. I won't go up there. Look, do you think I'd ask you to take me up there if I didn't trust you? You are sweating. Thinkin of the dead man's money is making you sweat. I blame myself. It's my fault for you been like this. Somewhere I must have done something wrong for you to be like this. You're not going to take me up there? I haven't climbed in 10 years. That in itself would be enough for a man that gets old. And besides, my hands are not as strong as I were. And the mountain is against me. That would be enough. There's all that, but there's one thing more. The most important thing. It isn't right. Isn't there anything inside you that tells you that it isn't right? You want me to take you up to the top of the mountain within the sight of God, so you can pick up pockets of some dead people? Does money means that much to you? I'd do worse than that to get out of here. Take the house. It's yours. Sell it. Whatever you get for it is yours. Draw whatever papers you have to have and I'll sign it. - You'll have to be satisfied with that. - It isn't enough! Don't you understand it that it isn't enough? Now listen to me! You and I have worked hard all of our lives and we've got nothing to show for it. Up there, a half a day's climb from here, there is more money than you ever saw before. How can you sleep with all that money just waiting up there? I can sleep because I don't want it. - What are you doing? - I'm getting out the climbing gear. What does that look like I'm doing? I told you I wouldn't go up there with you. I heard you. Alright, you won't go. I'll go alone. God protect you, you've gone mad! You can't go alone! Even with me it wouldn't be sure! It took me 12 years to learn the right way up! What do you think, it's like climbing stairs? Listen. Listen, boy. Once I climbed alone. Only once. It was summer, 20 years ago, when I never got tired. A dozen times before I got down I gave up. - I was lucky to get down a life. - Maybe I'll be lucky. Don't think I don't know what you're trying to do. You still think you'll get me to go with you, don't you? You think I'll worry because you go alone. Go ahead. If it was summer I'd give you a chance up there, some kind of a chance. But not now. You'd never get past the first --. - You'll break your neck. - I don't care. You understand that? I don't care if I break my neck. It's all right for you to go on living like this, you're finished. You don't know anything better. I know what I want. It's on top of that mountain. It's the only chance I've ever had and I'm going up there to get it, even if I have to crawl, now will you leave me alone? No, not that -- . It's too old, I don't trust her anymore. We'll use the silk --. Silk calls its strength. In my room under the bed. You said "we"? I can't let you go alone. I guess you knew that all the time. Believe me, Zachary, you won't be sorry fo this. I'm sorry already. - Oh, if you'll going to be like that- - I'll take you up the mountain. And I don't like you for this. You might as well know it. That what you getting me to do, I don't like you for it. Go on, get the ropes. Take care of your equipment. - Lose anything else, but not the axe. - Some things I know. I don't take chances on the mountain. I treat everybody who goes with me the same, like they didn't know anything. Don't trust that too far. Use it only if I get into trouble or something. You gave me the second best rope. You'll be on the end of my rope. Something goes wrong, I'll be on the end of yours. Wanna change? Come on, let's move. Take it easy. It will be a long day. I thought it'd be easy to get this far. You hurry. Everybody hurries when they first start. You sure we'll reach the base of the mountain by 08:00? I'm sure. I think you're wrong. I still can't see the mountain. Are you sure we're going right? I'm sure. You'll see it soon enough. We can always go back, Chris, it's not too late. You go back if you want. I can't let you go on alone. Then move. Get moving. I wanna get to the mountain. - No. - Eat it, whether you want it or not. There is the south face. You sure that's the best way? It's the only way. But is it safe? - Want turn back? - No. - How do we go? - Over there, that up. Almost straight up. We cross the snow ledge. -- on the left a little more. Up above 30 feet to the chimney. We'll use the pit arm there. After that we'll rest a little. How long will it take it to reach the top? If everything goes well, four or five hours. Now here, you show me how you're going to be --. Here. I'll always want our body --, you'll be -- looks easy, you understand? That's good, that's good. Now, when we're using pit arms, when the -- gets shallow, I want a rock to --. You understand? - Are you ready? - I'm ready. - You ready? Shall I come up? - Come up. - All right so far. - Yes. Which way from here? Looks tough. It's where I fell with the English man. - No other way? - No. It's all dead smooth. I know. You're afraid. Yes. - You don't wanna give up, do you? - No. I'm just afraid. Not more than usual. This is a bad place. And there'll be others. Can you find holes, do you think? Maybe there's a better way. No. I don't want you to pulling me down, like you did... Untie yourself if you want to. Let go of the rope. If I'll do, I'll have to cross alone. Yes. No. Either we -- or we don't. I'm going on now. You alright? Don't talk to me. Not right now. - Chris, can you see? - Yes. Off my left hand, there should be a -- crack, 5 or 6 inches long. I see it. How far above my hand? About 10 inches. Fine. Anything above my right hand? About 6 inches, there's an -- rock. I'm gonna try for it. -- on the rope. I have to move my left foot. That's your best hold. I know it better than you. Are you alright? Let me get my breathe. Alright. Send up the packs. Okay, -- away. Alright, you come up now. What's the matter? It's the last part. Even with the rope I never thought I could do it. Which way from here? The chimney. You never looked at it, it's full of ice. It always is, except in summer. Then is running with water. The ice is better. We just have to be very careful. Servoz knew what he was doing going up the other side. Servoz is dead. Aren't we going to rest? Snowstorm rising. - If it catches us here ... - Maybe we can wait it out. - No, we gotta keep moving. - I'm tired. You get rest while I'm going up. Much easy at first. When it starts to widen out, I'll use the pit arms. Watch for them on your way out. But don't trust them too much, because the rock is -- by the ice and the snow. About 100 feet up, I have to cross the crack. That's the difficult part. Now, you must be ready to pull the rope tight when I tell you. Start with your left foot otherwise you won't come out right, you understand? I understand. Pull the rope tight. Are you alright? - Where are you? - I'm almost up. How much rope is left? - I can't hear you. How much rope is left? None. Come up about 15 feet. - Fifteen feet? - Yes. Gimme some slack. Hold tight. Don't move now. Hold me. Slack. Tight! Alright, your turn now. Come up. - I said come up. - Alright. Wait! Wait, don't pull on the rope. It's caught on on my left arm. All right. Pull! Have you got me? - Have you got me? - I've got you. Pull! Give me some slack. Where are you now? I'm below the second pin. I can't reach it. Don't say that. Try hard, you're almost there now. My hands are frozen. I can't hold on. I'm getting a cramp. Don't tell me that. Try hard. Give me some slack. - Wait! Wait! The rope is caught. - Where? Above the third pitch on. Give me some slack. I said give me some slack! Is it safe? --. I'm safe, go ahead! Chris! Chris, are you hurt? Chris, can you hear me? I can't move. Get a hold, any kind of hold. Have you got a hold? I can't climb. I can't. Chris, I'm going to pull you up. You can't. It's impossible. I'm going to pull you up. Help me wherever you can. One more. When you shooked out the rope, the vibration caught me. I moved. I hadn't expected it. My pack pulled me over backwards. We've got to get out of the wind. Come on. I want to go back down. Do you hear me? Let's go back. You can lower me down. - It won't be easy. - You can lower me down, Zachary. All right. - Its' too bad. - What do you mean it's too bad? Chris, the worst is over. It's easier from here all up. We could be at the top by noon. You're lying to make me go further. I don't lie, you know that. Do whatever you want to, but... after we've come this far, we're over the worst --. It seems too bad not to go on, it was a good climb. Something to be proud of. Look, look at that, you've hurt yourself. You couldn't be able to help me from now on. I can help you. I can pull you up as a dead weight if I have. You're just saying that without thinking, like you always do. I'm saying it and I mean it. - Can we make the top by noon? - Yes. - And -- me back down - Yes. Well, then we'll go on. It's something to be proud of, allright? It's a good climb, and... It's a first too! It's never been done before this time of the year! And we did it together! You and me! Something we can remember all our lives. Something to be remembered all our lives. We made it. It's just a walk from here. It was a good climb. It can't be far from here. Probably on the other side of that ridge. - What? What are you talking about? - The wreck of the plane. Wreck..of the pla- Oh, the wreck of the plane. Oh. That's why we came up here, I...I forgotten. You forgotten about it? Why do you think I'll risk my neck coming all the way up here? Well, I just forgot about it, that's all. I just thought about the climb -- started... somehow it seemed important for we to get here, I don't know why now. I know why it's important to me. Come on, I'll show you. There it is! I knew we'ld find it! Stop it! Leave them alone! God forgive you. And me for bringing you up there. Not bad. I told you. --, they all have exactly the same things: Watches on their wrist, rings on their fingers, money in the pockets. It bothers you first, but, after a wihle they're not people anymore. They're just things. It's almost time to go back down. - I'm not ready yet. - Haven't you got enough? This is just junk compared to what's inside the plane. What do you think you're doing? By spring they'll be buried in the snow. They shouldn't be buried without something to mark the place. You fool, you won't think something like that. Then when a rescue party -- they'll know somebody's been here. But it's a cross, you're breaking a cr- Listen, Zachary. All your life you've been climbing this mountain. Up and down, like a crazy man, breaking your bones. Taking people where nobody in their right mind would wanna go. Now for the first time in your life when there's any reason to come up here, all you can think of doing is... is putting two pieces of metal together and playing like a baby, I... Here, watch that for me. - Zachary! - Don't worry, I won't leave without- In the plane back there! Something moved, there's something in there. - The wind. - No, no, no, I saw it. There's something back, there's something moved. Zachary, what is it? It's a...bring my pack! Oh you must...be hurt bad. You..don't! Don't be afraid. It's all right. It's only me. You...you're all right now. We'll get you out. I-I can't hear you. I...I could hear you that time alright, don't know what you said. Just be patient and...and we'll take care of you, I-I promise... One of the passenger's still alive. She must have...crawled here and cover herself up. -- anybody looking trough a crash like this. She's probably dying. Is she dying, Zachary? I don't know. She's dying. Look at that! Look at that, her nose it's a diamond! A diamond, her nose. She's a Hindu. I heard they did that in India. It means a rich, important. That's a real diamond, you know that. - --. - Get away, go, go away from her. She's dying anyway. We have to get back on the -- before it turns dark. No. No. We'll stay here tonight. We'll down in the morning, maybe I can help her. - You wanted to leave, Zachary. - Not now, not now, not while she's still alive. It's alright with me. You give me more time. I...I know it hurts bad, but... you'll be alright. You'll be alright now. I don't understand. Oh, you're...trying to tell me what happened? It must have been like the end of the world when the plane crashed like that. And then...when you were left all alone and no one came for so long. But you don't have to worry. It's alright now. We'll take care of you. You...you...wondering were you are. Well, you're...on a...on a mountain. We had to climb. We had to climb. The mountain. Everest! Yes, that's right. Everest. Like...in the Himalayas, we call it. But you don't have to worry, I can get you down. I know how to get you down. Wish I knew how bad you are hurt, but... Here. Now, that's a good girl. You don't have to worry. We'll take good care of you. Not too fast. Not too fast. What do you want? - Don't scare me like that. - What do you want? I'm just taking a look at her. She's getting worse. She took a turn. She seemed to know where she was a little while ago when she took a turn. She's dying. I told you. You're foolish trying to save her, by morning she'll be just like the rest of them, and it's allright with me, it'll save trouble. - What do you mean? - Nothing. Just talk. - Get away from her. - All right. She's nothing to me. What do you think you're doing? Fixing a sled for the girl. She's -- dead, it makes no difference. She'll be alright, the doctor in the town will give her something. -- she'll be alright. You still think you'll take her down into town. - Of course. - You can't. If we're seen, -- that'll give us away, everybody -- we'll been up here. Can't you get it through your thick head? Listen to me. Do you think anybody will believe we came all the way up here just for the trip? The police will be after us, they'll ask us questions, we'll be searched, arrested, is that what you want? If we take that girl down into town, we have to give away everything we got. It's time to start now. Down the mountain. We're going down the mountain. But you'll be alright. I know the way. We go by way of the glacial. And the glacial is frozen over after a storm, and it's the safest and easiest way. You'll be alright. Listen. We'll leave her here. - We leave her here, she'll die. - She's going to die anyway. Maybe not, it won't be so bad going down the glacial. We have to try it anyway. You'll be nice and warm. There. I have to cover your face, becuase snow's so deep. You're breaking my arm. You quiet. Now you'll leave her alone. Zachary! Wait for me! Zachary, wait! Zachary! Wait! Zachary, wait! I'm sorry, Hindu lady. I know it hurts, but it's the only way. Are you warm enough? Yes, you're alright. Now we'll go on. Zachary! Wait! Zachary, which way do I go? How do I get to cross? I don't know. Zachary, for the love of God, which way do I go? How do I get to cross? Is it this way? Tell me, is this the way? At least tell me that! No. No, it's not safe that way. You're lying. You want me to stay up here and die. I'm coming with you. No! We'll soon be there. Soon be there. You'll be warm. I'll light a fire and I'll close the door. You'll be safe. You'll like it, here with us. Cause we don't have any elephants here, the way that you do in India, but... we have marmots, we have -- -- birds, montensas and goats. Christopher shout a -- one day, I don't know why. You know Christopher? He's my brother, fine brother. He's my friend. I brought him into the world, my own two hands. I took care of him when he was little. But he died. Now I'm alone. Do you hear that? It's a dog bark. My dog. We must be almost there. We're almost there. So I said "Who is it?" and he said "It's me, I've been upon the mountain." And I said "Well, what have you got there?". He said "I've got a woman from the wreck of the plane." He had brought her all the way down by himself, so I hitched up my wagon there and brought them down to the mayor's house because I knew the mayor would know what to do. In behalf of our little town... Later we'll make speeches, where's the woman who was brought down? Upstairs. Hey, you said on the phone that you thought the woman would live. Do you still think so? - She'll recover. - She'll recover. - Can she be moved? - Well, if it's necessary. Don't worry, I want you to stay with her. I've arranged you'll have everything you want at the hospital down in the city. If you're ready, we'll move her right now. I'll make the arrangements. Remember what you asked me once? I want to know what happened. He didn't tell us anything. You must tell what happened. You didn't go up there alone. You're good, but not that good. My brother was with me. - Where is he now? - He's dead. It happened on the way down a cravasse. Was crossing a snow bridge and it broke. What are they talking about? Chris Teller got killed on a cravasse coming down. After your brother was killed, you brought the woman down the rest of the way by yourself? Must have been rough. She lived through it. Were there any other survivors in the wreck? Watch it. Allright, get this end up. Carry on. Take it easy. Goodbye, Hindu lady. Yes, yes, I'm very please to have met you. Goodbye. She's a...very beautiful girl, isn't she? Zachary, one moment more, please. You understand I'll get all the details in a few days after you get over this. There's one thing. Something I have to know right now. About you and your brother. You understand? You want to know why we went up there. It was my idea, I wanted to rob the plane. Nobody's gonna believe that, Zachary, not after what you've-- It's true. I wanted to rob the plane, I knew there would be money and things and I wanted that for... buying sheep. Things like that. - What about your brother? - No. No. He was against it. He begged me. You could see that, he... but I made him come with me cause he was my brother. So we climbed the mountain and we found the wreck. Then, while I was robbing the plane, you know, ... my brother found that Hindu woman. Still alive and he helped her. And then...then, in the morning... you came down the mountain? I didn't want to bring the lady with us at first. Let her die. That's why I said, "If you let her die, nobody will ever know we were up here." But my ...my brother made me bring her with us. All the money and things that I took, he made me put back, "It doesn't belong to you", he said. My brother said that. "Doesn't belong to you, Zachary." He brought the Hindu lady down, he made me help him, and then, when the snow bridge broke, he fell, and... I came all along with the lady, that's all. - You saved her life, Zachary. - No! My brother saved her life. You have to write that down, now, no? You write that down, yet. My brother saved her. Will you write that down? I'll write anything you say, Zachary. Well, then, write it down. The way I told you. My brother was a good man. He's name was Christopher Teller! And he did it all. It was his idea to save her. - Zachary, I never heard you lie before. - Tell him, Father, tell him good. I'll expect you at -- Sunday. We'll be there. I'll make sure he is. But first he has to fix my roof.
