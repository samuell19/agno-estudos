[dramatic music] [native american music] [gunshots] [phone ringing] Yeah. MAN (ON PHONE): So I hear we're going back to work. That's right. I want you to pick me up in the plane. MAN (ON PHONE): When? Day after tomorrow. MAN (ON PHONE): Where? A place called Rock Springs. MAN (ON PHONE): Who the hell is this shit-kicker? He's a nobody. Named Gibbons. He's just my way in. I'm going after the man who pulled the trigger. MAN (ON PHONE): Is this official business? No. It's personal. [rock music] Just a little. Just a little time with you. Oh, just a little. Just a little time. We don't need forever. Just the time it takes to take our time. Whenever we're together the world stands still. Getting bored of chasing this asshole. [gunshot] Happens every time. MAN: Hey, Jimmy, nice place to park your car. MAN: Good to see you, son. [chatter] Hey, Stevie. Hey, man. Stevie, I got myself a little problem, man. I need some help. Jimmy, you've always been nothing but trouble. [country music] I'm nothing but a working man. I fell in love with an uptown girl. You guys really gotta cover for me now. Cover for me. [chatter] You want something here? I take it you must be the maitre d' of this nice establishment. I'm the owner here. And I don't want no trouble. Get out or I'll call the cops. No, that won't be necessary. You see, I'm here looking for a nice young man by the name of Jimmy Gibbons. I said get out! What are you going to do this, join the Little League? Kick his ass, man. Now, there's an easy way to do this, and of course there's a hard way. I just as soon-- [grunting] SPECTATORS: Oh! OK, so it's gonna be the hard way! All right! What are you doing here? Nice little girl like you doing in a place like this? Hey, asshole! Here, catch. Oh! Why don't you put that away before you cut somebody? [glass shattering] Come on! Get him! Get him! Come on. Let's go. Come on! Why don't you come along now, Jimmy? Someone wants to see you. Yeah, well, piss on you, buddy. Hey? Ooh! Ow! Ow! Ow! SPECTATORS: Hey! DUKE: You want to keep going? What are you doing? What are you doing? Are you crazy? Jimmy, he's got a gun! And who might you be, his lawyer? Move it! Move! You're in my way, fatso. And what do you want? Thanks for the help. Say goodbye to your pals, Jimmy. COP: Freeze, asshole! Hold it right there! Drop the gun! Do it now! Drop the gun! I'll blow your brains out the other side of your head. Hey, I don't give a damn if you're the governor of this state. You do what I tell you, you understand? DUKE: Yes sir. Walk your ass over there and put your hands on the wall. Do it now! Put your arms behind your back! DUKE: You're making a big mistake here. No, partner, you're the one that made the mistake. Now, you want to tell me what the hell's going on here? Name is Evans. I'm a bounty hunter. I have a warrant for this man's arrest. He jumped bail across state lines. - I didn't-- - Shut up! You got ID and a warrant? You'll find ID in my back pocket, a warrant on the dashboard of the vehicle parked across the street. - I'll check it out. Watch him! Well, Mr. Evans, let me tell you something. Bounty hunter or no bounty hunter, that doesn't give anyone the damn right to come in my town and wreck the living shit out of one of my bars. You understand? I do apologize for that, Officer. Apology not accepted. Yeah, I need a record wanted one time. Subject's last name is Evans. First name's Duke. Holy shit. Could be a male, Caucasian, 39 years of age, blonde and blue-- - Holy shit, Jimmy. - Stand by just a minute. You won't believe what this asshole's got in his truck. He's driving a battleship. What's he got? He's got an M16, an AR-15, a Mack 10, and all kinds of other shit. How do you explain that, mister bounty hunter? I got a permit for every piece. Every piece? There's a federal tax stamp on some of it. Warrant looks fair on the face. Hey, man, I'm filing charges against him! Shut up! He tied me up with a hose! Take him in the car. JIMMY GIBBONS: Filing charges against you, buddy! I'll tell you what. Let's check all the guns out real good. I want to take him down-- JIMMY GIBBONS: Filing charges against you, man! You can count on that! - All right, load him up. Shut up! Let me tell you something, Mr. Evans. You're probably looking at quite a few assault charges. You understand? Yes, I do. Get in the car. Watch your head. Boys, go find something to do. I think I can handle this. Go, go, go, go. [chuckling] You know, you got more firepower in there than Patton had when he was marching across Europe. I must have seen that movie 50 times. Well, I wish I had time to show you my gun collection. But you just not gonna have the time. You see, Mr. Evans, I've already-- already got enough trouble in this town, and I don't need any more than I already have. And, boy, when I look at you, all I see is trouble. Sheriff, you got a good reason for keeping me here? Hell, I don't need no reason. I own this town. I keep you as long as I want. I did supply your deputies with all the proper paperwork you know. Yeah, you know, that's all well and good, but let's just back up here a little bit. Now, why is it that some big-town bounty hunter comes down here loaded for bear through my little town looking for some low-life, small-town, frog-headed, shit kicker like Jimmy Gibbons? Now, why is that? Criminal jumps bail. I go get them. It's what I do for a living. Ah. That's all well and good. But you see, Mr. Evans, I ran a little check on you. And, uh, it seems that you're not some small-time two-bit bounty hunter. You big time. You go after the big money. Am I right so far? Now, why is it that you come down here in my town looking for somebody like Jimmy Gibbons? Well, hell, if you put his brain on the edge of a razor blade, it'd look like a BB in a four-lane highway. I guess I got a thing for small towns. People are so warm and friendly. I like that. Yeah, they are warm and friendly. But you know what? They're not very receptive to, uh, out-of-towners, if you know what I mean. Oh, yeah, I get your meaning. But I wasn't planning on moving here and starting a family. Well, that's all well and good. Well, that's why I had your car towed in. It's right out front there. Now, why don't you get in it and just, uh, drive on out of town, Mr. Evans. Today. Well, I tell you, Sheriff, I'll give that some thought. I'll be back in a couple of hours for my prisoner. (LAUGHING) No way. Don't worry about Jimmy Gibbons. I got enough to keep him around here for a while. And don't worry about it. I'll see that he gets what he deserves. I see. Well, thanks very much. Yeah. Have a nice day. Have a couple of boys follow that asshole. Go on, get out of here. OK, Sheriff. We'll take care of it on this end. That sheriff of yours is a real nice guy. Yeah. He was just telling me a real interesting story. About an incident that happened here about a month or so ago dealing with an Indian, name of, uh, Thomas Foot. Yeah? What was the name of that arresting officer again? Well, that'd be Eugene. Eugene Barnes. Ah. He wouldn't happen to be here by any chance, would he? No, today's his day off. He'd Probably around home though. Thanks. Would you mind signing this for me, please, sir. Thank you. I'll see you later, Kevin. Hey, Willy. Here comes that cute little squaw. Yeah, she's looking fine. Hi, babe. What's going on? Excuse me. Can't you even say hello? Just please let me get by. Is there a problem here? You ain't getting no problem. You have a problem, Tonto? Please, Kevin. No trouble. [siren blaring] All right, let's move it! Don't worry. I'll see you at home. How you doing? [phone ringing] Barnes here. Eugene Barnes? [dial tone buzzing] What a jerk! Son of a bitch! [muttering under breath] (WHISPERING) Stay right there. What in the hell's the matter with you, Eugene? You bite a dog? No, I was just brushing. Never mind. Did you see anybody out here? Oh, that nice old lady next door there. What are you doing here? Bennett wants to see you. Why? He didn't tell me that. He don't like to wait on anybody. You better get ready and let's go. Yeah. OK. I'll be right there. All right. My daddy and my granddaddy lost everything in the Depression and nobody gave them shit. They used to have a little place right over there. A little house. I remember when I was a kid, we used to have to eat cold biscuit. Didn't have no-- didn't have no shoes to wear. But! Who gives a shit about the working man? Nobody. I ask you. Here I am, a public servant doing my duty, and they give this land to these goddamn dope smoking, alcoholic dirt farmers. I ask you. Is there any justice in that? Sheriff, you know, this is all really very interesting, but the bottom line is if we don't close this land deal by the end of next week, we're gonna have to find a new location. Hope that's clear. Oh, yeah, that's clear. Don't you worry about that. I'll have all the acres you need by the end of next week. Well, I wish you the best of luck. You know where to reach us. Let's go. Yeah, I know where to reach you. Have a nice day. Eugene. Hey, boss. Want a chew? What's that pretty little waitress' name that you're dating? [mumbling] Look, we, uh-- we got a little problem. You know, that bounty hunter, he came down here looking for Jimmy Gibbons. Looking for Jimmy? Mhm. But that ain't what bothers me. What bothers me is-- is that he went down to the station and asking the boys around about you. Jesus. I knew I saw someone at my house. I told you this was going to happen. I knew it! Jesus Christ, they're gonna catch us. I know it! Eugene, it's all right. Now, what I need for you to do is just go about your average, everyday police duty. And I'll worry about mister bounty hunter. All right? Yeah. Eugene, didn't I once tell you that I was gonna make you rich? Didn't I tell you that? Huh? Yeah. Well, it won't be long before you'll be driving yourself a brand-new Cadillac convertible. I told you I was gonna take care of you. You let me worry about it. OK? I'll take care of the bounty hunter. [sighs] [country music] --on the highway say stop. Don't walk back-- Would you like some more coffee? Yeah, sure. Sure you wouldn't want anything to eat? No. No, thank you. I hope you don't mind my asking, but by any chance would your name be Marion Foot? Why, yes it is. But how did you know my name? Frank. Good morning, Eugene. Oh, hi, Wanda. How are you doing? - I'm doing just great. How about a piece of chocolate pie? I'd love it. All right. Look, I, uh-- I need to talk to you. Sure, go ahead. No, I can't do it right here. MARION: What do you mean? Me It's something important about your brother. Kevin? Did something happen to my brother Kevin? No. I'm talking about Tom. Were you a friend of my brother Tom? Yes. We were very good friends. Near that motel that's right outside of town-- I want you to come see me there when you finish work. Then I'll tell you what I'm doing here. All right? OK. Deputy Barnes? Yeah. What can I do for you? I'd like to get some information about a shooting that took place here in this town. A shooing? What shooting? The shooting of an Indian by the name of Thomas Foot. I'm not real clear on the details on that. Maybe you should talk to Sheriff Bennett. Yeah. Yeah. OK. That's a very good idea. Don't you have any rounds to make, Eugene? Just on my way out. Well, now. This is interesting. What is it that you would like to know about Thomas Foot? Well, I was told that he was killed right here in this town about a month ago. That's a fact. That's a fact. You see, he was arrested on a drunk and disorderly charge. And while incarcerated, he assaulted a police officer. And it seems that he took his gun. It was an-- an unfortunate necessity on our part. It was a damn shame. Damn, I hate to see those things happen. But you see, when you're in a town like this, when you have all the friction between the white and the Indian population, it's-- you don't know what's gonna happen. Well, that's about that. Now, is there anything else that I can do for you? No. That'll be just fine. That's good. That's good. Because I want you to seriously, and I do mean seriously, think about my, uh, terms of you leaving our little town. You see, I don't want to stir up any racial tensions around the town right now, if you get my meaning. Oh, yeah, I do get your meaning. And I do appreciate your concern. Yep. Well, I ain't got all day. Yeah, that's what we like to see. We'll see you next week. Look, I'm really sorry. I'm a little short this week. EUGENE: Jesus Christ. The sheriff ain't gonna like this. Better watch your ass, boy. MAN: B 13. B 13. WOMAN: Bingo! Let's go to your office. How you doing? You know something, Buck? You wouldn't figure that bounty hunter for the bingo type, would you? Sheriff's real impressed with the way business has been going here. I'm gonna have to raise the ante a little bit to, uh, $200 a week. OK? You got me? Good luck, chief. Hey, chief. Don't call me chief. Put that back. You know, sometimes, Eugene, you try-- you try-- you try my patience. What are you talking about? I'll tell you what I'm talking about. There's a very good chance that bounty hunter's been following you all around all day! - What? - What? - Where? Where? What, where. There's been a change in plans. You think you can get in your car and follow me? - Yes, sir. - Do you? - Yes, sir. - Well, then move it! - OK, OK. - Let's go. Goddamn it. (ON RADIO) Eugene, you copy? Yes, Sheriff. Why don't you take our friend Mr. Evans to our usual drop-off point. I'm arranging a little surprise for him. I don't like this, Sheriff. I'm just gonna scare him, Eugene. You just make sure you don't lose him. Should have been a goddamn fireman. Let's go. MAN: You ready? MAN: Yeah, I'm ready. Here he comes. [suspenseful music] Yahoo! [gunshots] All right, let him have it! Yeah! MAN: Give it to him! MAN: Better get your ass out of town, son! Run, son! Yeehaw! MAN: Come on, let's move out! Let's get out of here! Come on, load up! [laughing] Jesus Christ! I thought you said you were just gonna scare him off! Shut up, Eugene! We got a problem here. And I'm gonna handle it my way. Billy Bob, let's move it. How'd you get back out, Jimmy? Like I told you, I get friends in high places. What are you gonna do if that bounty hunter comes a-looking for you again? Don't think he'd be too stupid to worry about that. Sheriff's done told him to get his ass out of town. You won't see the likes of that bounty hunter around here no more. That sheriff owes me a favor. A big favor. [knocking] MARION: Hello? Is anyone here? Uh, just give me a minute, please. Hello. Uh, please come in. Have a seat. I came as soon as I could. Um, did you come alone? Yes. Did you see anyone else outside? No. Uh, thank you for coming. What I needed to talk to you about were those two police officers that you saw me with in your coffee shop this morning. Well, um, Sheriff Bennett runs the town. And he makes no secret about the fact that he hates Indians. I want to let you know that I'm a little frightened about being here. The only reason I came here was because you told me you were a friend of my brother. That's the only reason I came here. Believe me, I knew your brother very well. Let me get you a glass of water or something. Thank you. I'm sorry about this, but I have very good reason to believe that your brother was murdered. My brother and I did everything we could to get an outside investigation. But no one would listen. They said we had no proof of any wrongdoing. I believe there was plenty of wrongdoing. If there's anything I can do, I will. You haven't told me what your name is yet. I'm sorry. Uh, my name is Evans. I don't think it's really safe for you to be here right now. So I'll call you in a couple of days and I'll explain much more of this to you, all right? OK. I'll wait to hear from you. MAN: The manager says he's in the corner room. [gunshots] [screaming] [gunshots] Are you all right? Come here. I'm OK. But who were they? And why were they shooting at us? If you ask me, I think it's your sheriff, or at least some good friends of his. Well, that's very possible. He sometimes hires local rednecks to do his dirty work for him. You won't be safe here. Come and stay with my brother and I. It's on Indian land. Sheriff Bennett won't come on that property. He has no jurisdiction. Well, I'm not gonna argue with you. Come on. Get in. I don't want you to tell anybody who I am or why I'm here. You understand? MARION: OK, if that's the way you want it. But I should warn you that whites really don't come out here and my brother Kevin can be a little difficult. I'm sorry. It'll be fine. Don't worry about it. Who's he and what's he doing here? He's a friend. Since when did we start having white friends? Kevin, don't start. He needs a place to stay. In our house? Look, maybe it's better if I just go. Yeah, that's a good idea. MARION: Kevin! Yeah! That's not such a good idea. Now, back off! Oh, yeah? Yeah! Stop it, now, please! He's here to help! Now, Kevin, he's a friend, and I mean a friend, and that's all. Now, I want you to apologize. I don't apologize to anyone! MARION: Kevin! Please, come in. It's a little bit chilly tonight. Maybe we should start a fire. Sure, let me give you a hand. Oh, and, uh, if you'd like anything to eat or drink, go ahead and help yourself. Thanks. COP: [inaudible]. Jesus Christ. Sheriff. Oh, boy. This is definitely getting out of hand. I'm telling you, he knows. He knows everything. I don't know how, but he knows everything. We're getting in deeper and deeper! We're gonna end up like this if we don't cool our shit! Jesus-- Oh, shut up, Eugene, and quit your goddamn whining! I gotta think. What the hell is there to think about! Jesus Christ! He comes to town for Jimmy Gibbons, now he's looking for me! He knows what you did. What I did? We're all in this together, dipshit, and don't you ever forget that. Besides, he doesn't have any proof. And the only way he could get proof is through an eyewitness. You're not, uh, planning on telling our little secret, are you, Eugene? - No. No, of course not. The motel manager told me he left with someone. He came to town alone. It's got to be someone from this town. Nobody around here's gonna say anything. And it they did, they'd end up just like this. Was one of my-- my best men. Wonder what I'm gonna tell his poor widow. Let's go! Listen, tell me about this brother of yours, this, uh, Kevin. - Well, he's hurt. And he's angry about what happened to our brother Tom and what's still happening to the Indian community around here. What is the story about this town? What is going on here? There are no jobs around here, and the white people blame the fact on the Indians not being willing to give up their land to the oil companies, who say they'll come in and supply jobs. I guess it's none of my business, but why don't you sell? It seems like you'd stand to make a pretty good profit. There's a lot more to life than just money, Mr. Evans. Generations of my family lived here. Men in my family fought in wars to defend this country. So why do we now have to accept being pushed off the only thing we have left by oil companies and racist bullies? You really think there's a piece of land worth dying for? You know, in some way you remind me of my brother Tom. And then again, you all are so very different. How did you know him? We both served in Vietnam. Here's a picture of him. We went through a lot together. We stayed in touch over the years. A few months back he wrote me telling me about some of his troubles here. He said if anything ever happened to him, he wanted me to look out after his kid sister and brother. Ooh. What do you want? What are you doing here? Buck, who was MVP '66 State Champions? You were, chief. Thank you, Buck. Just wanted you to know that white boys play basketball too. Hell, even old Billy Bob. [chuckling] We've come to talk a little business with you, Kevin. Uh, maybe we'd better talk downstairs. (SINGING) Camptown lady gon' sing this song. Doo-dah, doo-dah. Camptown lady gon' sing this song. Oh, doo-dah day. [humming "camptown ladies"] Doo-dah, doo-dah. Come on, come on. Phew. All right, let him go. Boy, it's hot in here. Sheriff. Shut up, Buck. Now, you listen to me, you son of a bitch, and you listen good! Because I'm gonna tell you this one last time. I'm making you one final offer. Because the next time I come out here, I might not come out here just to see you. I might come out here to see your pretty little sister. How would you like that? Huh? I hate violence. I hate it. [groaning] You OK? The boy's sweating like a Louisiana whore here. Shit. You better cool off, boy. (SINGING) Camptown lady gon' sing this song. Doo-dah, doo-dah. Camptown lady gon' sing this-- I won't sell my family's home! And you go near my sister, I'll kill you! Good morning. Morning. It's a beautiful day, isn't it? Yeah. Very beautiful. Did you sleep well? Yeah, just fine. Tell me, you and your brother run this place all by yourself? Yes, we're part of a co-op of all the Native Americans here. We work together, helping each other to keep our land. And we take care of ourselves rather than ask for handouts. I'm impressed. So tell me, you really think you can [inaudible] considering what's going down here? I'm not letting my brother's death be for nothing. I'll defend my right to stay on my family's land to the very end. Lots of luck. Luck has nothing to do with it. What is it you care about? I mean, who are you, really? It's like I told you. I was in Vietnam, where I met your brother. It's where I learned how to kill people without feeling guilty about it. When I came back home, I joined the police force. I hated it. So I went out on my own. Now I track down criminals who jumped bail. It pays good. You make your own hours. So what is it you're going to do here? I'm gonna find the man that killed your brother and I'm gonna bring him in dead or alive. [chatter] You sure you're in the right place? [laughing] Did you see the way he walked in here like he owned the damn joint? Boys, let me tell you something. You've been doing one hell of a job for me and I really appreciate that. We'd do anything for you, Sheriff. You've been a good man for this town. Right, boys? Oh, yeah. MAN: Great. Damn right. You listen to that, Roy? Well, I appreciate-- put that down, will you, Roy? Well, boys, I appreciate that and I can, uh-- I can tell you this. Things are gonna pick up around here. You can rest assured of that. Good. As a matter of fact, why don't you buys come on along with me right now? You might be able to help me out on a little certain business deal. That is if you boys got time, now. I don't want to take up your time. You got time? Let's do it Well! GIRL: Hi, Sheriff! Hello, Bobby Sue! How your mama? Fine. She gonna grow up to be a cheerleader. Well, you gonna feed your face all day, Billy Bob? I got it, I got it. Good boy. Oh, boys. Um, you're gonna have to drive out there in your car, if you don't mind. Oh, and, uh, don't speed or I might have to pull a "Walking Tall." [laughing] Let's go! Let's go! You want to ride with me? [laughing] We have a daycare program here as well as a senior citizen center. We also have a law clinic where Native American attorneys supply legal aid for our community. I guess this seems all very different from the cliche image that white Americans seem to have about the Indian. Yeah, I guess you're right. Most people think you all still live in tepees or something. Yeah. We do a lot more than just [inaudible].. This is a hospital completely supported by the Indian community, where we take care of our own people's needs. Yesterday we were talking about the legends of the different tribes-- This is our Freedom School. My brother Tom started it. Yeah, he used to talk about it over in Nam. He was very proud of it. It's where we teach our children tribal traditions so they develop a sense of pride, a sense of identity, and a knowledge of their heritage. It's so important that they know where their culture comes from. Oh, uh, look, I have to check something in the office, but why don't you stay and watch? You just might learn something. Hey-- His name is Konekawasha. Washer This is Konekawasha and his friend Uncle Billy Washington. And Uncle Billy was a Choctaw medicine man, or Indian doctor. And every day Uncle Billy would have to go out and gather around-- please sit down if you'd like to join us. Thank you. He lived in the Yellow Hills down in southeast Oklahoma. And every day Uncle Billy would go out and gather his herbs to make the medicines to help the people get well. And Konekawasha would go with him and help him. One time Uncle Billy's family wanted him to go into town and have his picture taken. And next to him was a table. And there wasn't anything unusual about that. But when the film was developed, there was Konekawasha standing next to Uncle Billy on this table. The years went by and Konekawasha, and Uncle Billy were very, very close. And when Uncle Billy passed away, Konekawasha was very sad. And the Indians down there say that late at night up in the hills you can see a little light going through, and that that's Konekawasha looking for another Indian doctor to help. Well, Kevin, I guess you was on the way over to the courthouse to see me. I told you I wasn't selling my land, Bennett. What's that? I said I wasn't selling my land. Why, I never said nothing about-- did I say anything about selling land, boys? No. No, sir. Tiny, there's something wrong with this car. Look on the front and see if you see anything. Hey, Sheriff. He ain't got no license plate. No license. And that-- [sniffing] Do I smell alcohol? Homer, look in there and see if there's any alcohol. Yes, sir, Sheriff. It sure looks like somebody's been drinking some alcohol in this here car. [snickering] Well, spread 'em. Well, that's sure a waste of good fishing, man. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to, uh-- to, uh-- oh, shit. Here, read him his rights. [laughing] You have the right to remain silent. TINY: Come on, let's ride, boys! I want to thank you for showing all this to me. But it's, uh, really time for me to get going. Are you sure there's nothing I could do? Bringing in this prisoner Gibbons, this won't be much of a problem. But dealing with two crooked cops is another matter. Please be careful. You're the one who should be careful. See you. These are truly difficult times we live in. We're all trying to get ahead. You know, Kevin, you're a lot like your brother-- [door slamming] --and make life difficult on yourself. But what pisses me off is is you make life difficult for me. And, goddamn it, I don't like that! I don't have time for this shit! Your land, my land, who gives a flying fuck! We're all in it for money. Now, I made you a good deal, just like I did your brother, God rest his soul. Don't let it go too far, Kevin. Don't. I don't like doing this. Donny! Roy, I didn't ask for no shave. No, you didn't. But I'm gonna ask you a few questions, like what are you doing back on the street? Hey, you. They told-- they told me they took care of you. Yeah? Who told you that? Who! Sheriff Bennett. Really? Now, tell me one other thing. Who killed Thomas Foot? And you make me believe you, Jimmy. It wasn't me. I swear! I didn't have nothing to do with it. They just told me to set the Indian up, that's all. Just for to start a fight. That's all I was paid to do. Tell me who paid you to do that. Sheriff Bennett. And who else was involved? Who! Deputy Barnes and Sheriff Bennett. [tv playing] [door clicks] Sheriff? I don't think the sheriff will be coming, Deputy Barnes. What do you want? I haven't done anything. Maybe, maybe not. That's what I'm here to find out. Mr. Barnes! Don't make this difficult for me. Now, I'm willing to take you in alive, but I have nothing against bringing you in dead. Listen, uh, maybe we can make some kind of a deal or something. Maybe-- maybe some money. No deal. No money. Just the truth. This Indian is one tough son of a bitch. This Indian's one dumb son of a bitch. All this trouble for a piece of land. We can't turn him loose looking like this. Is he still breathing? Barely. Give him your gun. What? Give him your gun. He's gonna try to escape. We won't get away with it. You think anybody's gonna miss one dead Indian? Have they ever? So it was the Sheriff. Yeah. I was right there. I want you to turn around, then I'm gonna handcuff you. Then you're gonna come with me. Go. Where you taking me? To a witness protection program. Sheriff was right. There's our boy. This is really embarrassing. COP: Watch out for Eugene. SNIPER: I got him. Take him now. SNIPER: Damn! What about these kids? COP: Back off, back off. Sheriff, he's got Eugene, all right. Couldn't get a shot at him. What do you want us to do? Well, considering he's attempting to kidnap one of your fellow officers, I would advise you getting your ass out there and finding him now! Put out an APB on him and move it! Goddamn! [sirens blaring] Somewhere, somehow Bennett's gonna stop you. The man's crazy! Believe me, I know! He'll catch you! Oh, shit! Hey, Duke. Good to see you. What's the plan? Get the hell out of here as fast as possible. BENNETT: Unit 617, I've got them in sight. DUKE: Let's go. All right, let's get her up. Stop the damn airplane! I'm gonna blow the nose cone right off that son of a bitch if you don't stop it! Stop! Buck, tell the boys to block the end of the runway. We gotta stop this son of a bitch. I can't get enough runway, Duke. What do you want me to do? - Go for it! Stop this thing or you're gonna get us all killed! DUKE: You can't live forever, pal. It's not gonna happen, Duke. I told you you're a dead man, Evans. You're history. DUKE: All right, let's shut it down. EUGENE: You're a dead man, Evans. Come out of that plane with your hands up! I know you got a gun, so get those hands out or I'll punch you in your belly button! Walk to that car right in front of you, bounty hunter. You hear me! I'll tell you what, this thing ain't nothing compared to that stunt you pulled in the pool hall. It wouldn't make a pimple on a boar's butt. Walk to that car. Get your hands on it right now. Step back and spread your legs. Watch him, Buck. He's dangerous. I'm taking Eugene Barnes in to see the state district attorney. He has some information dealing with a crime that took place in this town. COP: Put your hands behind your back. Put 'em behind your back! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed before any questions are asked. Yeah, Sheriff, uh-- Get out an APB on them two [inaudible] boys. Do it now. You got anything for me? Goddamn it, seems like all I do is sign papers. PAM: Chief, telephone for you in here. Oh, thank you, Pam. Thank you, honey. You're welcome. Bennett here. We got a damn interesting problem here. You know that bounty hunter you told us about? Well, he's kidnapped Eugene and claims he has reason to believe Eugene's involved in some sort of a crime. Thought you might want to be made aware of the situation right away, sir. Well, that's-- that's mighty good thinking on your part. Thank you, sir. Uh, I think you're going to-- have to go ahead and terminate both of these situations for me. You mean Eugene too? I'm afraid so. Afraid so. Have a good day. All right, I'll be in my office. Throw that out, will you? Guess your plan got shot to hell. [laughing] Hey, you want to take these things off? Get In the car, Eugene. We'll take care of it in a minute. Huh? Get in the car. EUGENE: Is this a joke? We were partners, guys! I know your family! (CRYING) This can't be happening! Seems like the sheriff thinks you're a hell of a lot more trouble than you're worth, Eugene. Nothing personal. I'm just following orders. You know, ever since he got that Indian kid, uh-- what's that Indian kid's name, Dave? Kevin Foot. Kevin Foot, yeah. It's just a matter of time till he has all the land he wants. Besides, I don't think he wants to keep any skeletons in the closet. You know, Eugene, I think I'm gonna be taking your place. You son of a bitch! Asshole. You think you're a badass? Huh? He thinks he's a badass. Well, I don't like badasses. I don't like badasses, bounty hunter. I have had it with the bounty hunter. Goodbye, asshole. [gunshots] God damn, do you drive much? Let's go. God damn it! Shut up! EUGENE: This is a bad place to be. Let's go. Who's there? DUKE: Open up, it's me. Are you all right? Yeah, I'll be fine. Look out. I got our man right here. You killed my brother? I never killed anyone, lady. Sheriff Bennett killed your brother. This is our eyewitness here. But we got a bigger problem. The sheriff's got your brother locked up in his jail. Oh, my god! Look, look, don't worry. Don't worry. I'll be able to get him out of that jail 'cause Mr. Barnes here is gonna help us. Come on. [phone ringing] God damn it. Sheriff Bennett here. Hello, Sheriff. I want to thank you for your friendly escort out of town. Well, you do surprise me, Mr. Evans. Yeah, I bet you are. But, look, you've got something I want. Now, give me the kid back and I'll get out of your life. Well, now, you're a hard man to discourage, but, uh, why should I give you anything? It seems that Mr. Barnes has a great deal to say. Have a nice day. I will have a nice [gun cocks] day. I've known the man 15 years. He's gone too far to stop now. He's gonna kill her brother and then he's gonna come and get us. Not if I can help it, pal. I signed your paper. Now What else do you want? Well, I'm gonna let you go. What you think I was gonna do? You're a real smart boy, Kevin. And believe me, you did the right thing. Listen, you did the right thing for you and that sweet little sister of yours. But whatever went on in here between us is just between us, right? I mean, it'd be to your best advantage not to start any rumors, if you get my meaning. Be sure to say hello to Marion. And, uh-- Buck. Escort Mr. Foot to his farm. He has something to do for us. - OK, chief. Y'all drive careful, now. You bet. Aren't you guys riding on the wrong side of the road? How you doing, Buck? I'm doing fine, Harvey. What do you guys need? Sheriff Bennett called us. He wants us to take Kevin here the rest of the way home. Said you wouldn't mind. I'm gonna have to check on that, Harvey. You go right ahead, Buck. Check on that. Hi, Kevin. Remember us? Yeah, this is Buck calling in. Is Sheriff Bennett there? Morning, Miss Jones. COP: Sheriff. Yeah? Buck just called. It seems some of your boys took Kevin Foot. So? Well, sir, he said they're a little wild and drunk. You call Buck back and tell him I don't give a shit. You understand that? 'Cause this is no longer a police matter. This is personal. Out [hooting] Come on! What's the matter, Injun? Woohoo! [gunshot] MAN: Bounty hunter! MAN: Let's party! You remember to bring the fire crackers? Woo, party hardy! [gunshot] Hey, bounty hunter! Let me at that tall, skinny bastard! We having a party here and you the guest of honor! MAN: Come on out, bounty hunter! Hide Barnes in a safe place. He's the one they're here for. MAN: Why don't you send Eugene out! If you try to run, I'm gonna kill you. Just keep away from the windows and doors and do what I tell you. Keep him in a safe place. Come on out! Tiny wants to beat your ass! And old Homer wants to blow somebody away today! All right, send him in! Mama didn't raise no fool, bounty hunter! [laughing] We'll send him halfway. When we get Eugene back, then you can have him. Homer, make sure he don't move too fast. [gunshots] Jesus Christ, Homer, can't you shoot better than that? Woohoo! MAN: You coming out? Or do we kill him? You stay with Barnes. I'm gonna draw their fire into the woods. [gunshots] Homer! No! Come on! Let's go! Hey! I tell you, this is all just a little bit too familiar to me. Your brother and I were in Nam together. What? They're not giving me a lot of time to sit here and tell you war stories. Now, get inside, take care of your sister, and make sure nothing happens to Barnes. I'll give you some cover. Go! [gunshots] Oh, Kevin! Are you all right? I'm all right. I'm fine. It's OK. Tiny, you take that car. Cut him off. Run over him if you have to! I'm not letting anybody fire on you. Kevin! Woohoo! [gunshots] Have a nice swim. You don't want to try that, do you? Because you know what'll happen if you did? I'd take your head off, wouldn't I? Now, do you want to drive? [laughing] Hey, bounty hunter! Drop it! Drop it or I'll kill her! Drop it! [laughing] - All right, let her go. - Hell, yeah! I said let her go! Bounty hunter, you played your last card. The sheriff, he's sure gonna be happy if he find out I'm the one waiting with the bounty hunter. So just-- You're on Indian land! [gunshot] They didn't get to Barnes, did they? No. He's back at the house, safe and sound. That's good. Are you all right? I'm OK. Come on. Dwight, I know it's gonna sound corny, but, boy, my old daddy, he'd turn over in his grave if he saw this. Gentlemen, this is truly one of the best days of my life. For the first time, I can see myself getting ahead of the game. Well, Sheriff, the company really appreciates all that you've done for us. Now that you've secured these properties that we wanted, well, we'll set the ball in motion so we'll make a financial settlement on your behalf. [alarm blaring] Uh, you gentlemen stay here. I'm gonna have to look after a little police matter. Won't be long. Boys, we got a psycho who's kidnapped a police officer. Now, I'm gonna try to talk him down. But if that don't work, watch for my signal. OK, turn my officer loose. All right, Evans. Release the hostage. I told you it was wrong! It was wrong from the beginning! Why didn't you listen to me? Why! If he gets next to us, shoot him. You should have given it up! We planted the gun on him! It was all a set up. It was all so unnecessary. But why did you have to kill him! Why! Eugene, I told you! [gunshot] [music playing]
