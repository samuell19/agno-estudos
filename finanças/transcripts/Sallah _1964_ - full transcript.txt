It's a nice place, lots of air. When did you get here? Six years ago and you still don't have a house? Not yet, what can you do? You mustn't speak like that, Mr. Goldstein. You play backgammon? -Sure. Six years in a transit camp. Mordechai! Dad, may I look? What for, nothing is in place yet and he wants to see how we play backgammon. He wants to see. Go home. Does Mr. Goldstein have a cigarette perhaps? This is a good cigarette, this is a good cigarette. Let's start. Please, put down half a lira. I already owe half a lira. Start. What' s he doing? -Nothing It's just a clock. But he's disturbing my ears. Play. This is a good game. Are they coming? -l' m working, no? -And so am l. Get into the kitchen. -Alright. Please stop the singing over there. Sing after the meeting. I can't hear myself talking. That's your luck. Rita, please. Comrades, this is a general meeting and not a party. Silence! And in the kitchen please. You may continue. Friends, you know that in the hour of need our kibbutz is always to be found forging ahead! Please, Bat-Sheva. We have a lot of time. I' m sorry, but I've just finished work with the cows. Comrades! The many immigrants arriving in the country need us, and there is no doubt that we will do our best for them. For this reason, I suggest we adopt the transit camp. That means the transit camp. Who opposes the motion? Nobody opposes? Those in favor, raise your hands. Bat-Sheva, Zigi... Thank you friends. The vote is unanimous. Again the kibbutz has shown its ideological maturity. Who is prepared to be the counselor for our adopted transit camp? There are two. -The general meeting is over. No, it's not. -I disagree. I didn't vote... Excuse me comrade. Do you know where Shabaty lives? Over there. -Over there. Thank you. Miss, Miss, What's it for. What is it Miss? What do you want? What are you doing here? Nothing happened Lady. I' ll help you pick them up. That's nice of you. -You' re really nice too. Excuse me, are you by chance Mr. Shabaty? No, l' m his son Shimon. -Pleased to meet you. How do you do? This is my mother. -Salah! The government has arrived. Go quickly Salah. Perhaps she's a social worker. Sure. She' ll give you a note to get a house. A note for a house. That's good. I' m coming. I' ll be back right away. Hallo. -Hallo. There's no work, no food, no house, 7 kids, one on the way. His name is Ben-Gurion. We need a note to get a house Lady. Mr. Shabaty, I don't give out notes. It's my job to help you solve your personal problems. That's it, and what's your trade? Shoemaker. -A shoemaker? -What's wrong with that? I can't talk like this. Come please. -What? -Come. One moment, Mr. Shabaty, I have a few questions... Here. Please sit down. -Here? - Yes, please. Thank you. That's it. Now... Now the lady gives a note for a house, and that's that. Just a few more details, Mr. Shabaty. Did you have brothers and sisters? -Sure, lots. How many? You can't say exactly Miss. some of them died... About how many? -About a lot. When were you married? -A long time ago. How old were you? -Small. What's going on here? Is it a cinema? Lady, enough with the questions. We've finished. One moment, Mr. Shabaty, let me help you. Your lack of confidence is due to personal conflict, stemming from an underprivileged childhood. Lady, I don't like that sort of talk. Then I shall explain what I mean. Look, a snake bites you when you' re small and you forget, but the trauma leaves a scar on your soul. Who's small? You, Mr. Shabaty, when you were a child. Me? -Yes. Maybe. What happens after, when you see a snake near your house? Lady, there isn't a snake here and I don't have a house. We don't need snakes here. We need a note for a house, not snakes. Mr. Shabaty, you don't understand me. We must become friends, musn't we? We should get to know one another, no? That's true. What is the lady's name? -l' m Bat-Sheva. Bat-Sheva, are you married? -Single. Where do you work? -With the cows. -Cows? -Yes. One moment Miss. I' ll write it down. Cow-shed. Salleh, Salleh. Wait, I must think. The lady works every day and gets 60 lira a year. Yes, that's our budget. I can't even afford to buy a nice dress in town. Never mind, never mind. Where do you live? In a hut! -Like this one? -More or less. Only the married couples get a house. The single girls sleep 3 in room -3? Yes, 3 girls in one room. We don't have any money. We never will. You shouldn't talk like that Miss. -Yes. -You shouldn't. So you are in a difficult sociological situation? But, with the Lord's help it will be better. When Bat-Sheva was small, was she bitten by a snake? No, of course not. That's Neuman. I have to go. Goodbye, Mr. Shabaty. Nothing bad happened. Don't despair Miss Bat-Sheva. The government does what it can, good people help. But Mr. Shabaty, I came to help you. Neuman, Neuman. You should be well, Miss Bat-Sheva. If you troubles in your heart, l' m always here for you. You never disturb me. What a sociological girl that is. Forestry! Next! -Yes. -Name? Miki Raveh. T rade? -Dental Technician. -Forestry. Is that why I studied for six years? I don't care, I also studied and worked on the roads. Forestry. Next. Name? -Kalman Binstock. Work? -Administration. -Forestry. -Excuse me. Nothing. Your like all the other new people here. Next! It's your turn Dad. -I don't want to. I' m scared of him. Dad, it's for our new home. Alright, but stay with me, I won't go alone. We' re here Dad. -Next! Salleh Shabaty. -Trade? Shoemaker. -Forestry. Thank you very much. That is excellent, forestry. No forestry. When I arrived, I took any work I was given. I ate grass and slept in the fields, my friend. But I want. -I don't care what you want. Forestry. -Forestry. These new immigrants are poor human material. Right, it's very simple. As you saw, I dug a hole about 30 cms deep. This is the plant, shake and remove thus, you see? Put it in the hole, and cover. Now, press it down and dig a saucer around it Smile a little, can't you! And with that, lets go to work. Are there any questions? Yes, what's this for? We are turning this place into a forest! God makes forests. -Yes, but we help him. He doesn't need help. -Comrade, enough. To work. Is that enough? -Comrade, no time for frivolity now. Very nice. -So perhaps you' ll do some now? Yes, please, this has to be shaken. It's all wild. It doesn't want to be a forest. Hold it please. -What are you doing? You' re hitting it like a shoemaker. -That's true. The old man doesn't like working, does he? -What? He'd run away if he could. Do you know him? Yes. He's my father. Yes, my Dad also... So, 30 cms as we said, and cover the plant. Please Sir, what is that for? I' m preparing a sign for the man who gave the money for this forest, my friend. Here's the happy donor. How do you do? -How do you do? Mr. and Mrs. Birnbaum, this is your forest. After me please. -Thank you. No, no... Go, go on. What's up? What do you with me, Sir? What's going on? He won't let me go past him. Simon! -l' m coming. Where is that driver? I love working in the garden. You know, my dream is a small house and garden. I' m also learning to be a cantor. Comrade, they' re hooting at you. -l' m not deaf. I know One day, l' ll show you how I work in my garden. Comrade, they' re hooting again. -Be seeing you. See you. -Goodbye. " In Jumlat the old Messiah lives " alone in a house, without..." What's going on over there? What's he doing there? What's that Sir? Another one? It's the tourist season. Everyone wants a plaque. But that's not nice Sir. It's like a lie. How do you do? -How do you do? -Follow me, please. Mr. and Mrs. Zimmershein, This is your forest. What the hell's going on here? Hey, stop that, d'you hear me? Stop that! Stop that. What are you doing here? It's Mr. Birnbaum's forest. For them, you have to plant a new forest. You, you' re fired. Me? -Yes you. -Blessed be his name. Salleh, you' re the first guy to be fired from relief work. There's a lot of people there. I need some relief myself. You haven't learned the rules of the game yet. It's a new game. Goldstein, where did you get so much money from? I've got a bit left from the last elections. Elections? Is that hard work? No. You get paid for voting political. You put a letter in an envelope and you' re off free. Which letter? -The one they tell you. Goldstein, looks like for once there's some easy work though I can't work at it. -Why? I don't recognize the letters so well. It doesn't matter. It's secret and no one sees. So how do they know what you put in? -They don't. That's democracy. "The evening breeze, Sings in the trees "To whom does it sing? To you and to me. 'The two of us here... Hush. It's late. I must go home. Can't we walk a little? That's how things are here, not like in the kibbutz. Who says? Maybe I should ask if I can date you? Is this a date? -Of course. In a minute. Habuba! Habuba! To hell with it. Habuba, Habuba, Home. What's the matter Salleh? I don't like that counselor from the kibbutz. He's turning Habuba's head. -Habuba's a good girl. Did I say she was bad? Only in the evening, I want her in the house. House? This is a house? Can anyone see a house? Sits in his hotel all day long, doing nothing, like a king, and says, house, he says. Don't start with me woman. Give Paula some milk. Backgammon, backgammon all day playing with that Goldstein. He's not ashamed. An Ashkenazi playing backgammon. We' re all Jews. There's no difference. How long do we have to stay here, with the little ones playing in the dirt and the big ones running around like... Is it my fault? -Did Ben Gurion make my children? Go to work so we can get a house. -What can I do? They said they'd give us a house and they don't. Everybody else gets, except me. What can I do? Good evening. Where's the money? -Money? -From the work in the forest. He took all the money Shimon earned as well. He went to drink in the coffee shop. Drunkard! Drunkard! Give me the money. Lord of the universe, this is Salech Shabaty talking to you. You, who brought us out of Egypt, look at me, How do I look? How? The wife is right. There's no work or house, nothing. All day long backgammon. The house is not a house. It's a children's store, that's all. Lord of the Universe, help me. Everything is awful. Please Lord, do something for me. Help me Lord! Help me! Help me! " Announcement about the elections" for the Knesset. Why have we been sent to this hole? You should know that the Party values every vote. Good. What do we do? -l' ll tell you. From my experience in the last three elections, the transit camp has a very efficient system. They find the local " leader", the " strong man", the " king pin" of the place and that' s it. Hallo, my friend, where is everyone? -The coffee shop. Park at the side. " All is well with the Messiah, -Ho! -God will bring fortune. " In Jumlan the Messiah lives alone, without wife or child. " Saved money all his life, so that he could buy a wife. " How many dinar has he saved? -Only Alla knows " Maybe three dinar? Maybe a hundred times so. " Maybe thirty dinar? Maybe twice as much. " Maybe three hundred? -Lets raise our glasses. 'All is well with the Messiah. Ho! -Allah bring him fortune. " In Jumlan the Messiah's alive At 70 he bought a bride. " A good woman for all his gold Many sons to make him bold. " How many will he have? Seven with God's help. " If he only has six? The Lord be praised. " Maybe only five... " If the Lord wills it one son He will give. " All is well with the Messiah. Ho! -Allah bring fortune. " In Jumlan, the old Messiah prayed to have a son. "The Messiah was in Heaven, not one child, but seven. " And who was born first? -The daughter Jamila. " And who was born second? -The daughter Jamila. " And who was next? -The daughter Jamila. " And who was born last? -Zillah and Gilah. " His name's not given to sons until the Messiah comes. " His name's not given to sons until the Messiah comes. In short, Mr. Shabaty, what are your conditions? For my vote, first of all, I need a house. We' re already building. You' ll be the first to get a house. We don't just make promises, we always keep them. It will be good. Elections are good. Can I move on now? -Only after the elections. What's the difference? Before or after? Comrade Shabaty. -Comrade? Never mind. We've come about the elections. Elections, that's good. Please sit down. Cigarette? " A gift to the transit camp, donated by the Party." Goldstein... -What's up? -A miracle happened. They' re giving us a house and everything we need. You made an agreement. -Yes, with three parties. Each of them promised me something. It was really hard to say no. I know, I have a deal with four or five parties. So how do you vote? -According to my conscience. Greeting from the Party. We hope that you will chose our man to fight your battles. Things like that are not forgotten, Madam. -A small gift. -Thank you. Accept this gift from the Party. We hope that you will chose our man to fight your battles. -A small gift. -Thank you. Greetings from the Party. Take these home, we' ll bring more. Come back quickly. I hereby declare the polling booth station open. Mr. Shabaty, please. That's me. This, and this. And this. And this. And this. And this. And also this. And some of these. And some of these. Next please. -Next. I haven't finished yet. And this. These are for the children, and so are these. And this and that's enough. There's a lot. In here, yes? But the hole is too small. It doesn't go in. It's no good. -Excuse me. What are you doing? -What are you doing? It's alright. It's difficult to vote so much. That fell and that fell. Wait a minute. Do you know what you' re doing? What do you want? There's no room for all of it. It fell down. " Disqualified" They disqualified my vote but l' ll get my house. They told me I'd be the first on the list. The Lord should bless all political parties. -Amen. Housing? -T ransit camp? -Let's go. Nice. What's this for? -It's for letters. Are we going to get letters? That's good. This one will be for you, and this is for you. There's enough for everyone. This one is for me. It's all new. Your shoes. Look how nice. Like a synagogue. -Nicer even. It's lovely. -lsn't it nice! It's new. Dad! That's for water. And this... And this one is also for water. For water there's two taps. Rat a tat. Like a train. There's two for the electricity as well. For every room a window. for the air. This is my workshop. What the hell do you think you' re doing? Who gave you permission to come in here? It's our house. We got it for the elections. Elections. Where is your documentation? Documents, there's a lot. This, or this. All sorts. Idiot! Documents from the Ministry to prove possession. Why, these are no good? What minister? Sir, believe me, they told us. "They said", doesn't work with me. Bring me the papers and l' ll let you into the house. Now get out, while l' m still in a good mood. This is not good. The government doesn't allow us in. Get on. " Ministry of Housing" That man works well. I know him. Stay here. Let's go. Back to the transit camp. What did he want? -Money. -They said it was for nothing. The house is for nothing. The papers cost money How much? -A thousand lira. A thousand? Dad, are you asleep already? -Yes, what do you want? The houses were so nice and new. -And white. Why do they trick us all the time? -Because we' re new. You trick greenhorns. -It's mean. -Why not? One day when we've been here a long time we' ll also trick the newcomers. I' ll fix 'em. If, let's say, a new immigrant comes to my shoe shop. What do you mean, your shoe shop? -Never mind that. He asks for new shoes, I say, " l' m sorry Sir, You have to wear old shoes, why, because you are new. " I was also new once." I say. That's the way it goes. That's what you' ll say to the poor guy? "You won't believe me Sir, once " I lived in a dirty, old hut, " but I never said a word. " I didn't wait to be given a kiosk, my friend. " I went to work in the road gangs and in the forests. " I sweated my guts out, the way I worked" Now it's late. You've got to go to sleep Mordecai. Perhaps l' ll look for a job. No, you' re too young. You still have to learn. Someone has to work, no? Neuman, l' m obliged to point out that hired labor opposes the basic principles of the movement. -4 men Chichi. Even half. We' re talking about quantity here. Did we adopt the transit camp or not? -We did. So these are like our own sons. But ideologically that is absurd. Who knows? Maybe you' re right. I thought that. OK, send 'em back. It's not that. I need someone in any event. Even half a man. Neuman, you should live so long, you wouldn't do that. Let me have him. I' m sorry, I've already promised him to the kitchen. One, just one I want. -Neuman, l' m getting mad. You, you go to the fields. -Neuman, Neuman. Neuman, I want him. -Excuse me? What? We've known each other for a long time I helped the lady picking fruit. -You picked fruit? -Yes. Can you work with the cows? -Who, him? -I can learn. He's cut out for the job -l' m mad about cows. A real case of mad cows disease. -OK. T ake him. But he's mine. -Neman gives, Neuman takes away. -Simon. Hallo Mr. Shabaty. -Hallo Miss Sociology. -He's a good boy. Pretty as a picture. -Dad, stop it. -What's wrong? Are you still three in a room? -We' re four now. If Miss Batsheva wants to live with us, she's welcome. That's kind of you Mr. Shabaty. -lf you have any problems, I can always help you. -Thank you, but it's OK. What's going on, a party? -Goodbye, Mr. Shabaty. Come my friend. You can help me move my office. What's up with you? -What's this? -It's nothing. It's a very big nothing. -Don't worry, he's our guard dog. Come with me. -He should go first. Jeremiah, sit. Are you afraid of dogs? -l' m not afraid of anyone. It's just, I don't like the way he looks at me. Freda, I've found some one. We' re moving the cupboard. At last, thank goodness for that. Move, my friend, move. Is this the cupboard? -No, this is the cupboard. You take it. One, two, my friend. One, two. I must think. How much? -How much what? -Money. How much? The same that we give everyone. Six lira a day. -I don't talk to women. *?Sir, it's not like for everyone. -Friend, we say here. Not Sir. I don't know the lady. Why should I say friend? Sir, a porter gets per unit. -my budget is just six lira. No, this cupboard to that house, seven. Finish it already. -You tell me where l' ll get another lira. I don't care, as long as you take that monstrosity away. Take a lira from the animal budget. -Thank you, Lady. It's nothing friend. Sign here please. And here. And also here, please. And here. I hope the committee will authorize this. Now get out of here, both of you. A bit right, and left. Be careful. What are you doing? Move, my friend, move. Lift it, one, two, and we' re done. I' m not doing that. -What do you mean? -No! Excuse me, we agreed that you'd bring it to this house. As far as the house, I said. This is the house. This far. And who will take it upstairs? Don't know. This is the house. Upstairs is something else. Oh yeah? Nobody makes fun of me, my friend. If need be, l' ll even do it by myself, even today. Guys! Come and give a hand. Yoske, just for a minute... You' re insane. 60 grush? -3 lira! Where do I get 3 lira? I don't know. You own the kibbutz. Sell it. -Sell it? That's wonderful, sell it! Look, the time is going. See here, friend Shabaty, you want 3 and l' ll give 60 grush. Let's reach a compromise. For you Sir, I do compromise. But cut out all the talk. -Alright, how much will you take? 3.60. -What? Well, what's going on? I' m doing just what you told me and nothing's happening. That's because you' re not concentrating. Sit closer. Put the bucket between your knees. Close your fingers. Don't bend over. -I won't tell my father how girls boss me. Your father is sweet. -Yes, he likes you too. Really? He says you' re a sweet, sociological case. Usually he won't talk to women. -You don't say. That's how it is with us. We take no notice of women. When my mother is about to give birth, we' re all scared. So, has Ben-Gurion been born yet? Paula was born and Mother shut herself away 2 weeks. I don't believe a man of Mr Shabaty's caliber who shows such concern for other people, a man who is so sensitive, would ignore his wife, in so boorish a way. Forgive me, if you want to know, l' ll tell you, I have never met a nicer man. When he looks at me with... those flashing eyes of his, and when he smiles at me with that smile... I would, do you hear me, if he was 20 years younger I could fall in love with him. I swear... Why aren't you milking? Have you got two left hands? Like this, like this. Isn't it boring with four hands? Boring? I could do this from morning till evening. Alright Comrade Shabaty, I won't go on vacation. From me you' ll get 4 lira and want Mr. Comrade not to have a vacation because of me. I' ll go, l' ll go. Just take the cupboard upstairs. -Alright. Mr. Comrade, you have a cigarette? Anything, as long as you take the cupboard up. This is a good cigarette. You have a good job? Yes, l' m an accountant. -And my brother can count sheep. I' m the kibbutz secretary. I' m an official. Then it's another 50 grush. -Why? -For being an official. Now it's 5 lira and 1 0 grush. No, my friend you won't get rich at the kibbutz expense. I' m not getting rich. I just need How many cupboards a year do I have? -I don't know. Just one. -How many children do I have? -I don't know. 5, 5 boys 2 girls and a girl. -Very nice. -What's so nice? Not nice. -lf you had problems Sir, like my problems you wouldn't talk like that. Don't you think we need to eat? We need electricity, glasses for Mazal. the sick fund for Juli's asthma we need. -You need, you do. Who needs? -No need, l don't need. I just need to rest The cupboard can sit here forever. -But the rain will come. The flood can come. Hallo Joseph, the wise one. The Lord bless you and keep you, Goldstein. If you stop playing backgammon with me, I don't know how l' m going to make a living. But it will take a year till I can win a1 0000 lira from you. 6 months. -That's also a long time. Goldstein, 1 000 lira and I get a house. A lovely house. Haven't you got anything to sell? -No, l' m a shoemaker. Mr. Goldstein, perhaps you have something I can sell. I could sell the clock with the bird in the flea-market. It doesn't matter. I don't need it Goldstein. How can I earn some money? There's notices. -For work? " Lost, a white Poodle.

If the lady loses a cat, l' ll find him for 30 lira. If it's little and skinny, for 20 lira. Never mind, take the money. Take the glass. You stay here and l' ll go and get him. Puzzi, Puzzi. Theodore, I want to cry. -Calm yourself my dear, soon she' ll be here with us. -My darling little dog. Come on, come here Puzzi. Here's your Puzzi Excuse me. What is that? -That's Puzzi, that is. That's not Puzzi. -It's a dog, isn't it? The man is mad. Get him out of here. That's not my Puzzi. How do you know? -It's 3 times the size, not a bitch, and it's almost black. -So it's black. -Can't you see? Always the same. Black's no good. If it's white it's good. No, it's really not because of that. I know, it's not the dog, it's the color that counts. Is that why I brought it all the way from the kibbutz? I don't have any luck. I never have any luck. Theodore tell him to go. -Get out of here. Go on. That Jeremiah is a dangerous dog. You have to be careful. Sir, please take me, take me. Please take me. Why not? Please take me. Please take me. No one wants to give me a lift. Why aren' t I a young girl? Good evening, Mr. Shabaty. Good evening fat driver. Get in. -T o the transit camp. Hallo. -Yes I see you' re always together. The silly bitch is in love with me. She's got a lot of money. She can't understand what we' re saying? Course not! What did you say, Honey? -We say you very pretty, sugar You silly man. She's nothing to me. You know who I really like. My daughter, Habuba! -How did you know? If it wasn't true, you wouldn't have stopped for me. I think about her a lot. I'd even be prepared to marry her. I know that you have different customs, I know, but l' m even prepared to pay or her dowry. How much? -How much do you want? -1 000 lira. I've got 600. 600. Would you marry her? That's it. You always get what you don't want. Always what you don't want. -Ain't that the truth? So what about Habuba? We' ll see. I' m thinking. You say the dog stayed there? And Mr. Kurtz and his wife, they were scared, and the maid. Come, let's have a drink. -What? It's very funny, Goldstein, but I didn't make any money. No, not the clock. Who needs it? -No -Who needs it? You know Goldstein, that fat driver wants to give me 800 lira to marry Habuba. -Shall I take it? Does Habuba love him? -l don't know, but she' ll learn. If not, l' ll kill her. -That's not nice. Not nice to sell your daughter. -Those are our customs. I need the money for a house, Goldstein. I can't go on living there. It's driving me crazy. You know, that fat driver's right when he says that you always get what you don't want, he says. If I wanted to stay in the transit camp to live, then they'd probably want me to go and live in the housing project, Mr. Goldstein. In a house? Do you hear? You get what you don't want. No Housing Project. We want the T ransit Camp. No Housing Project. We want the T ransit Camp. No Housing Project. We want the T ransit Camp The housing project is garbage. -Houses garbage. T ransit camp! -T ransit camp! None of this makes an impression on me. It's not for you to decide on absorption policy, but for the government. This is anarchy. Disperse at once, or l' ll call the police. Rabble! That was a success. Go home everyone. Go home, that was good. Juli, come over here. You' re staying here on strike. Sit down. Zigi. Zigi. -Yes There's a cab driver, you know him. He's tall. So what? -He wants to get married. Congratulations. -To me. He wants to marry me. You? Why? Do you like him? Dad likes him. -Then he can marry your father. You can marry me. Zigi, that driver offered dad 800 lira. For what? -For me. Well, you've got a good price, Habuba. Zigi, those are our customs. Aren't I worth 800 lira? -You' re worth a million. You' re worth a million. But we live in the State of lsrael not the desert. It's not nice to talk like that. -l' m sorry. Have you got 800 lira? It's not the money that is important, no, I don't have it. You don't love me. -I love you madly, Habuba, but I don't have 800 lira or even 8 lira. That's not true, you work in our place and earn a wage. But that all goes straight to the treasurer. -Wonderful. Those are our customs. Sorry. Zigi? -Yes. -Will you buy me from my father? -Yes, sure. I' ll talk to the secretariat. Perhaps they can help me. I shall fight them till the last bullet. Silence, I request silence comrades. Silence! Members, Zigi's problem is an individual problem. But it is also a matter of principle. No, Neuman, it's a matter of 800 lira. Fellow members, I am basically opposed to any form of buying women from outside the kibbutz. How's it possible from inside? Just a minute Zigi. Why spend money on a product that you can find inside the kibbutz. That's true. Maybe Bat-Sheva doesn't have two eyes or long hair. Ask her new helper with the cows. -Simon... That's enough, we' re really just friends. Simon... Just a minute, is it possible for a simple person to say something? My dear Zigi, there are some basic principles that even you cannot ignore. -For example? For example, that everything bought with kibbutz money belongs to the kibbutz, for example. No, no, it doesn't. A member of a collective can not keep a live inventory. But Habuba is not an inventory. -That's true. Shall I write this expense in sub-section 54? We don't have a budget for buying wives! Come on Neuman, it's still a basic necessity. When Saruki got lumbago, we bought him a mattress. We did, but the mattress belongs to the kibbutz. It belongs to the kibbutz, but only he sleeps on it. Fellow members, l' m leaving the kibbutz. Dad, can I talk to you for a minute? -Not now. Perhaps we' ll stop now? No, Goldstein. You' re staying here. You don't leave a game at a bad time. What's up? Someone wants to marry me. -Really? At last she's got some sense. She's a good girl, that one. When did you talk to the fat cab driver? -Dad, it's not him. It's Zigi. -Zigi? That's an Ashkenazi name isn't it? Mr. Goldstein is also an Ashkenazi. For losing a game, not for marrying. I love him Dad. -Never mind that. Does he have money? He's so nice. -Does he have money? -You' ll like him, Dad. Does he have money? -The kibbutz won't give him any. You' re never going to see him again, in your life. I can't do that Dad. Your good father tells you to do something and you can't? I' m sorry Father, l' m going to marry Zigi. Without my permission? -Yes. Without money? -Yes. Alright... Alright... I' ll kill you. I' m going to kill everyone. They want to steal my child and without paying for her. I' ll kill 'em all, the thieves. Thieves, thieves. Hallo Freda. -Hallo Zigi. Hallo Zigi. -Hallo Neuman, How are you? Maybe for all that Zizi? -For all what Neuman? Why have you come here? -It's like this Zigi, we came to prevent you from doing something irresponsible. Are you really stupid or are you just putting it on? There's nothing more to say. I can't live without Habuba. Habuba costs 800 lira. I don't get the 800 lira. I' m leaving to find work and that's that. -That's that? Very nice, l' m sure. -Leave it Neuman. Leave him alone. Zigi doesn't care about the moral harm he causes. The people in the camp will think they can grow daughters and sell them to the agricultural sector at exaggerated prices. But 800 lira is not an exaggerated price! Do you know how much aluminum piping you can get for that price. And 1 0 kerosene stoves. But who wants to cuddle up to a kerosene stove? Calm down Zigi... Fellow members, there is... Dear Lord... Hallo Mr. Zigi, l' m here. Hallo Mr. Shabaty. Please meet Habuba's father. We have already met. Hallo. -hallo Sir. You' re not going to give money for Mr. Zigi? Comrade Shabaty, let's have a talk, like old friends. Why? Comrade Zigi tells me that you' re demanding 700 lira for your daughter. It's 800, Sir. -800. Habuba is young and strong and can work like crazy. That's no way to... -I don't talk to women. It's difficult to accept that. You don't have to,Lady. A woman doesn't sit and Iisten to men talk. She does washing and cooking. See? My dear Sir. We are living in the 20th century. I live in a transit camp, Lady. The 20th century's not a place to live. -Nor is the camp. We' re not talking about living standards, but emotions. This is about a father selling his daughter, like a horse. A horse? I' m selling Habuba like a horse am l? Can you get a horse for 800 lira, can you? The lady knows how much is a horse? -1 200 or 1 500 lira. An old horse. A new one costs 2000. For sure Lady. You can get a woman for 50 lira. The sort of woman who's like Miss Comrade. Not young, not pretty, not work. Just talk all day. Certainly it's possible. -My dear Sir... No friend. -Dear Sir... Freda, leave him alone. -Zigi, leave me alone. This has gone too far. My dear Mr. Shabaty, You oriental communities, with all due respect, must try and adapt to our country's new, modern reality, and forget your own barbarian customs which you brought with you. Forget? Why should I forget? You always want us forgetting what's not good for you. Tell me Sir, if our customs are ' barb', whatever that word is we have a custom where the father gives 1 000 lira for his daughter to marry in kibbutz? This also we should forget? Not this. You say only to forget if not good for you. You say it's not good. Why? Why do Sir and Lady eat shnitzel all day? Pretty songs, pretty songs, like cotton wool. That's no good. Symphony in minor all day on radio to drive you mad. And that's good? Why Sir and lady hear this only this all the years? When they were little they heard just this, just this? Now already, they don't know what's good. Barbara or no, our custom is to pay father for bringing up daughter all the years for Mr. Zigi. Here in kibbutz, you sow and you don't want harvest? Enough. We don't need anything. Mr. Zigi, I wanted money for housing project, but now I don't need. I see you talk and talk but truth is, you' re poorer than social welfare. Finished. We don't need anything. To tell the truth, Mr. Zigi, I can get 800 lira for Habuba. What do you think of that? From a bus driver who is very inter-urban. But Habuba doesn't love him because of he's fat. We don't need. Salah Shabaty gives his Habuba for Mr. Zigi. For no money. How's that? Mr. Shabaty. -Thank you. Salleh Shabaty doesn't take money from poor people. Just a moment, poor? What's this, Neuman, we' re poor? Wait a minute. No fat driver is going to out-do our kibbutz. There's no difference. No money is no money Don't you do us any favors. You' ll get your money. Down to the last penny. -Freda, my dear. Zigi, what are you doing? Stop that, really. So you mean, you do want to pay me? Yes! Yes! Well, if you all want, l' ll take. Everybody here. Yes, the Sir is giving money for Habuba. Not yet, not yet. Sir. Neuman, Is it final? Where will we get the money from? I know. We can steal chickens. Sir... Not here, come with me. Mr. Shabaty, I congratulate you. -Thank you very much. I' ll never ever forget this. -Leave me alone already. I' m resigning anyway. Excuse me, Comrade Shabaty, how do you want the money? Like money. -I understand, but how many payments? It doesn't matter, as long as I get all of it now. No, not here. Come inside. 750! 49.50. More small change. 50... That's alright l' ll live. -From your lips.... Thank you. Got it. Now for the housing project. Here's our sociological. Hallo, Simon. -Hi Dad. -Hallo, Mr Shabaty.-Hallo. I've got news. I' m getting a new room. A family room. For how many girls? -Two of us. Simon and me. We' re getting married first, of course. What did you think? What, you and... get married. That's a good thing, my son. She's a very good girl. In spite of the snake bite. Come on woman, don't cry. This is a great day. Not only will we get a house, but also grandchildren... Bat-Sheva is a good girl, healthy, strong, works well. No! Yes. Enough, back to the camp. Salleh Shabaty, he' ll never have a house, never ever, Never, Salleh Shabaty, Never. What's going on. What are you all doing here? What are you doing? What did I do? You think l' m a thief? Leave my children alone. Leave my children. What do you want of my children? What have we done? I said you won't decide where you live. The housing project! What's wrong? -Go to the houses! -To the houses... That was successful, that was. -Congratulations Salleh. Congratulations. Backgammon? Off to work. Fix this. " In Jumlan lives an old Messiah, in Jumlan... " And he was lucky seven-fold " And who was born first? -Jamila, his daughter... " And who was born next? -Jamila, his daughter. " And who was after that? -Jamila his daughter, " And who was born last? -Zillah and Gilah " No son to bear his name. -Till the Messiah comes again. " Salleh Shabaty" Subtitles: Elrom Studios
