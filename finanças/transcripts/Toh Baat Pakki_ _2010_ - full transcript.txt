We're going ahead, and you're left behind. You car is slow. What do you care? It's our car. Papa that train crossed ahead as well. Son, train always travels faster than the car. And cycle? -Well.. That does too. I can't see your face. Keep this at the back. It will break. Don't you remember? This is the glass vase.. ..which Mrs. Rai gifted us on our anniversary. Since then I've been thinking.. ..who can I gift it, so that I don't get it back. Hello. -Hello. Hello. Congratulations. Oh, you're here too. Listen, this is sister Rajeshwari. And brother Surinder. -Hello. And Sister, he's.. -I know. He's Mohan. Mohan, you're very fortunate that you got our Sarita. Otherwise, all the boys in our neighbourhood.. ..got close to her but didn't get her. I mean, she rejected every boy she met. Thank you. Let's get a photograph taken. You stand beside Sarita. And I'll stand alongside Mohan. You won't come in the picture if you stand here. Pick him up in your arms. Just a minute. You won't come either. A little to the left. Please. Okay, ready? Okay, smile. Thank you. Do you remember Mrs. Chawla's marriage? It's nice. Isn't this fourth? -No Mama, this is an ice-cream. He's very smart. -Actually Rajeshwari, ..even I can't control myself over ice-cream. That's right. But just see the ice-cream that they've served vanilla. Butterscotch, almonds and raisins. They're expensive. -Right. I've heard that they've spent a lot on the wedding. Money can't teach you etiquettes. You should have taste as well. Carefully. Rajeshwari, they've found a suitable groom. Hi. The truth is, I didn't like him one bit. -Why? What's wrong with him? Listen, there's nothing wrong in this world. Everything is good. It's about matching Such a highly educated girl. And I've heard that the boy has only a diploma. He doesn't even have a degree. -Really? Both of them will look like.. Mrs. Rai. Eastman colour. She has worn every colour on her person. From sari to purse. Bravo. Everyone's laughing. What are you all joking about? -About you. What do you mean? Your tenant. We were talking about him. Haven't you thrown him out yet? I'll ask him to vacate the room on the first. He won't find another room immediately. It will take four to five days. And then.. I'll have the entire month's rent for myself. Rajeshwari. What gift did you give the bride and the groom? Looking at the size.. Is it a flower vase? It is. The one you gifted me. Happy? Listen. Please repair the hook of the wedding necklace. It came off thrice at the wedding too. It's come loose. I've been asking you for so long to buy me a new one. lf it has loosened, so, get it fixed. Why do you need a new one? -The fashion has changed. You've a knack of changing old things. Television, fridge, telephone, wedding necklace.. That's not it. I still have one old thing which I'll never change. What's that? I'll withdraw the money from the bank.. ..for the wedding necklace tomorrow. You're so nice. You always do whatever I say. But you haven't given the room upstairs for rent yet. That job is done as well. Uncle Gajendra called from Benares. His friend's son has got a job. And he.. -And he wants that room for free. Therefore, he remembered his nephew. Give the room for free, and then.. ..tea, coffee, breakfast and lunch everything. We don't want to do social service. Mrs. Rai's pigeon house.. has been rented out for Rs.1000. And our room is a grand manor compared to that. We won't charge anything less than Rs.1200. That's it. You'll get the rent. Let's do a Laxmi-Ganesh. Look, it's Laxmi. That means, concentrate on the money. With Rs.1200 as rent.. ..we can fulfil many of our requirements. The children have grown up, they need a computer. And Nisha. We've to get Nisha married as well. You know, these days whenever I see a nice boy.. ..I start thinking whether he'll suit Nisha or not. I've dreamt about this since she was small. That I'll get her married very grandly. She'll have a huge house. A big car. And the boy will be a prince. We'll find a gem of a boy for her. And everyone will be stunned to see him. I'm..I'm sorry.. I'm really sorry. Yes, yes. It's the grace of God. -I'm sorry. Otherwise, you'd almost killed me. No, actually, you were walking in the middle of the road.. Otherwise.. -So what? Will you kill me? -No, no. I was just.. Actually, I did some work on my engine. So, I was just.. Look, it stopped instantly even at the speed of 80. You're wonderful. -You did a good job. I'm sorry. -lf you like speeding that much.. ..then go for Olympics. Should I throw it away? Why do you trouble the pedestrians? This is our road. We pay tax to the government. And my husband is the cashier in a government bank. Look, it isn't all my fault. Yet I apologise. So, that's it. Forget it, madam. Let it be. Forgive him. Did I ask for advice? And what's all this? Are we shooting for a television reality show? Don't you've work? Leave. Come on, leave. Let's go. Come on, let's go. And you. lf I see you speeding your motorcycle again.. ..I'll dismantle all the parts. Of the engine, and yours as well. Likes to show-off the speed. Leave it. Listen, the key. And that's a six. What is it? -Ice-cream, ice-cream. Shlok, come here. Show me your hand. Ice-cream. -No ice-cream. You get a sore throat easily. Isn't it? Go. You're just.. He doesn't know what's best for him. He wanted to.. -He'll understand later.. ..that we did the right thing. But if.. -Fine, I understood. You've a habit of arguing with everyone. No, I mean you always argue with me.. ..but you argued with that boy as well. Who? That goon. I'm not going to be afraid of some goon. I call a spade a spade. That's it. There's a boy here to meet you. -Which boy? He's tall and fair. And he has muscles. And he's here on a bike. So, are you here to vandalise? To use strong-arm tactics. What did you feel? lf you come home, I'll be scared? Leave quietly. Otherwise, I'll thrash you so hard, you'll forget your name. Rahul Saxena. -What? That's my name. lf you hit me before I complete what I'm here to say.. ..then you can remind me of my name. Are you here to joke with me? -No, to return this purse. You left it on the street in the morning. Count it, it must all be there. No, there was an important paper. I was looking for that. Someone on the streets told me.. ..that you live in our neighbourhood. So, I asked for your address and.. -Oh, you live here. Where? -With Mrs. Rai. But you're Saxena. So, how can you be Mrs. Rai's relative? No, I'm her tenant. I'm studying in the engineering college here. Engineering. That's why you keep repairing your motorcycle. Oh, no. That's my hobby. By the way, I'm not doing mechanical.. ..but civil engineering. Whatever. But you're doing engineering, aren't you? Yes, final year. Okay, I'll leave now. Hey.. What did you say your name was? -Rahul Saxena. We're Saxenas too. I 'M Rajeshwari. -Really? And this is Surinder, my husband. -Hello. Nice to meet you. Which village are you from? -Biruwa. District Azamgarh. We're from Jaunpur. Sir, that's a nice car. Nice car. Yes, my grandfather.. He's from Azamgarh. Final year, engineering. Rahul..Rahul Saxena. Nisha and Rahul will look really nice as a couple, won't they? Yes. He's absolutely suited for your sister. But.. Don't always interfere with your buts. I'll have to, if you fly too high. Rahul is doing engineering. Do you know the rates of the boys these days? IAS officer, from 50 lakh to 1 crore. Doctor or engineer, 20-25 lakh. These people charge that much to get married. We're.. -Not everyone is concerned about money. Some are more concerned about the girl. And you didn't ask for any dowry as well. I'm neither good looking nor intelligent. Otherwise, I would've got an engineering degree.. ..and dowry as well. - No. But I've decided that Nisha and Rahul will get married. Now that you've decided, even God can't save Rahul. How are you? Rajesh. -Hello. Pankaj. Shaukat, how are you? -Fine, how are you? Absolutely fine. Shaukat, make a betel-leaf for me. Look..it's my job to make betel-leaves. First, give the money, and then take your betel-leaf. I follow just one rule. Friends are good, but credit isn't. Can I say something, Shaukat? -Yes, go on. There is no charge for talking. Might not be in other places. But in your place, we've to pay for everything. What are you saying? What if I prove that you charge pay for talking here? Then I'll do anything you say. Fine, tell me one thing. Everyone uses a cell-phone to talk. -Yes. You refill the balance in the cell-phone. -Yes. And you even charge money for it. -Yes. That means you charge for talking as well. -Yes. Yes. Come on, keep your promise now. -What? Refill my mobile balance today without charging anything on credit. I'll pay the money tomorrow. For sure. Sister. I'll be right back. He's coming. Sister. Sister. Oh, you. -Rahul Saxena. Yes, I recognised you. -I see. How are you, Rahul? -Absolutely fine. Come, I'll drop you. My bike is right there. You won't listen if I refuse. But we'll walk. Have you finished smoking, or do you need to go back? Oh, no. I don't smoke. Then you must be eating betel-leaf. -No, not even that. I came here to refill my cell-phone. Sometimes in the evening, my friends gather here. We talk about different things, it changes the mood. That's absolutely right. You can't spend the entire day in college or with Mrs. Rai. So, tell me, how is Mrs. Rai. -She's fine. Do you know, that tomorrow.. ..that is on the first.. ..she'll ask you to vacate the room? -No. Do you know where you'll go? -No. You do know that you won't find a room instantly. -Yes. Then she'll say, Fine, you can stay here a few more days. And charge you the entire month's rent. I didn't know that. -You should know. The world is very selfish, Anyway, you do know the address of our house, don't you? Yes, I do. -Look, you're a Saxena. You belong to our community. So, whenever Rai tells you to vacate the room.. ..you can take your stuff and come to my house. To your house. -Yes. Consider that there's a room vacant.. ..especially for you in our house. And don't tell Mrs. Rai about this. It's a very nice room. Come in. -Yes. You can see the rising sun from here in the morning. And you wake up to the chirping of the birds. And if you look out the window, you'll see greenery. You'll be able to concentrate on your studies.. ..and top your class. Sister, how much rent will I've to pay? Look, I like everything.. ..but not when kin discuss money. You're no stranger. -No. You're a kin. So, I'm sister, but.. -Let it be. Let it be. Sister, I'm not a stranger. I'm a kin. -Okay. Keep this down. Sister, all that is fine, but.. Still, I.. What is it? Today I gave you a room to stay you're asking for the rent. Then you'll ask for the price of the blanket and pillow. Tomorrow, if we serve you food.. ..you'll ask for its price as well. And then the day after that, if I get you married.. ..then you'll ask for my fee. No, Sister. Don't worry about my marriage. Why? Are you married? So, are you having a love affair? Oh, no, Sister. I just don't want to get married.. ..until I finish my engineering and find a job. You can study and look for jobs all your life. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't get married. No, Sister. The house can't be proper.. ..until the foundation isn't strong. Engineer. But I'm sure. No matter how many times you refuse.. ..your family must be looking for a girl for you. I don't have a family, Sister. All I'd was a mother, she passed away last year. Now there is just an uncle.. ..and he's mired in many problems himself. Uncle Rajbali. This is called 'Sashtang (knock-out).' Come on. Now, apologise to everyone. -Everyone? But we flirted with just one. Why did you.. -Apologise to everyone. Forgive us. I'll beat you. Uncle. -Nephew. Wait. Wait. Wait. Son. Son. Son. Uncle, what are you doing in my college? Those boys were flirting with the girls. So, I taught them a lesson. -Yes, but why did you come here? I've selected a girl for you. You remember Mr. Kedarnath? His daughter Janvi. Is he your uncle? -No, I'm his nephew. She's as virtuous as her name. It's a very nice family. They're the followers of Gandhi. He's a true Vaishnava (caste) who.. Uncle, you know I don't want to get married now. They were saying the same thing. -Who? Shyam Sunder Kedarnath. Shyam Sunder Kedarnath, who? Uncle, who are you.. -Janvi's father. Janvi's father. Is he your uncle? -No, I'm his nephew. I went there to make arrangements.. ..for the village council elections. So, I made a bad impression on him. He thought I was a goon. He said, I won't get my daughter married.. ..into a family of ruffians. My blood boiled. I hope you didn't do anything. -What didn't I do? I've made all the arrangements. We'll abduct the girl tomorrow. And get you two married. -That's what I came here to tell you. Uncle, what are you going to do? He's your uncle, isn't he? Yes, he's. Everyone has one. Uncle, you know I don't want to get married right now. And you want to abduct the girl.. ..and invite her family's wrath.. That's the problem with you educated people. You think so much that you can't do anything. Now, I'll have to leave. I'll have to cancel the arrangements.. ..I made for the kidnapping, Shall I send some clarified butter from the village? I'll have it sent. -Fine. Uncle. Uncle. Get the car. -Yes. Come, sir. He's your uncle? Everyone travelling to Jaunpur alight here. We've reached Jaunpur. Everyone travelling to Jaunpur alight here. lf you'd informed.. ..I would've sent someone to the bus-stand. Oh, Mother..I would've called Kashiram.. ..then he would've informed you when he'd time. I would've have arrived by then. But this time around, I'll give you a cell-phone. So that we can talk whenever we want. That's it. And I've told him to buy an inverter. He'll send it next week. -You look after us so well. Me and Nisha. You're my son, and not daughter. No, Mother. I'm your daughter. But daughters take more care. lf people understand that then India will reform. Nisha talks like that. -Really? But where is she? She's gone for her classes. To educate the wives of the farmers. I've selected a boy for her, Mother. He stays in our room upstairs. He's studying engineering. He's handsome, and has enough property and wealth.. ..in the village. So, if you feel it right.. What can I say? lf you like it, then it's fine. Okay then. I'll take Nisha with me tomorrow. And fix the alliance. Hail Lord Vishnu! Hail Lord Vishnu! He is the savior of his devotees.. He is the savior of his children.. He solves all their problems. Hail Lord Vishnu! You are my Mother. You are my Father. Give me a place at your feet. There's no one other than you.. There's no one other than Lord.. Who else shall I wait for? Hail Lord Vishnu! Nisha. There's a boy staying upstairs, Rahul.. He must he studying. Give it to him as well. Come in. You're.. -Aarti (veneration fire). Aarti. Nice name. I'm Rahul. -I know. Sister just told me. Oh, you're sister Rajeshwari's sister. -Yes. She arrived last night. She's beautiful..I mean, she sings beautifully. She doesn't just sing, she cooks well.. ..takes care of the house.. ..teaches the children in the village. And she's doing B.A. -Okay. And she's a topper in her studies as well. Hindi, History, Geography, she's a topper in everything. But her English is slightly.. English has unnecessarily been given such importance. Otherwise, English isn't that important. That's fine. But here, English is important to pass B.A. lf you don't have any problem.. ..can you teach English to my sister? -I.. Oh, no. I'm not forcing you. You shouldn't feel that just because we aren't.. ..charging you rent, you've to teach her. -Oh, no, Sister. I'll surely teach her. I.. Mama. -Coming. I'll be right back. -Yes. But I hope it won't be any problem to you. Oh, no. I'll teach you when I'm not studying, No, I mean.. I mean.. -I get it. It's okay. There definitely is something. Does he like Nisha? Our sister isn't a vegetable.. ..that he'll select her at one look. It'll take some time. Time? -Yes. Days or months? -What difference does it make? A loss of 1200 every month. Two months mean 2400. And three months mean.. -3600. I too know the tables of 12. Pass me that pen. -Move. That.. Let me do a Laxmi-Ganesh and clear everything. Lord Ganesh. Which means? -That means think less about wealth.. ..everything is going well. Before I start teaching you.. ..I should know how much I know. Sister, give it to me. I.. Did that hurt? -Yes. Where should I.. Sorry. Sit down. Start. -Yes. We should know how much English you know. So, what is your name? -Nisha. I did tell you. What are your subjects? You're so forgetful. Didn't I tell you? Hindi, History, Geography and English. Tell him. -No, I.. Wanted her to speak in English and know.. ..how much does she know, so.. -Oh, that way. She can speak fluently. You can ask her whatever you want. Fine. Now, translate whatever I say. -Okay. Shakespeare was a great writer. Shakespeare was a great writer. -Yes. Say it. Where there's a will, there's a way. Where there's a will, there's a way. Say it. Birds are flying. Birds are flying. Clouds are coming. Clouds are coming. I'm going. I'm going. I'm..going. -Oh, no, Sister. Please sit. No, no. I should leave. Okay, fine. `What is your name? -Nisha. Hungama. -Cartoon. Hungama. -Cartoon. Sana.. -Not on my stomach, not on my stomach. No. Sana, Shlok. Sana, quiet. Why have you created a racket? She snatched the remote. -He hit me. When did I hit you? Quiet. You two are creating such a racket. You know Rahul must be studying at the moment. He'll get disturbed. He's studying engineering, it's no joke. You two don't seem to get it. You need to use your brains. One needs silence for it. But you two have created uproar in the house. You're screaming more than us, Aunt. There's no confusion, it's very simple. Solar eclipse is a solar eclipse. And a lunar eclipse is lunar eclipse. Isn't it? When you don't see the sun, that's.. ..called solar eclipse, right? And when you don't see the moon? Go ask brother Rahul to teach you. He's tutoring aunt very well. I.. I.. -Go, go. Yes, I'm free. I'm free. You teach the best. Why don't you teach him? You talk such nonsense. Rahul will explain to him scientifically. Tell me, what is the centre of the universe? - Sun. Very good. Imagine that I'm the sun, so, what does the earth do? The earth rotates around the sun. -Correct. Now imagine that your aunt Nisha.. Imagine it, Nisha. Imagine that your aunt Nisha is the earth. Now, tell her what she has to do. Aunt Nisha, rotate around the sun. lf you go around, it'll be easier for Shlok to understand. So, Shlok, remember..the earth always rotates this way. When will the solar eclipse occur? -Never. Then what'll I write for my homework. -Anything. Oh, yes, homework. Yes, now, tell me who rotates around the earth. -Moon. Correct. -Now, mummy is the moon. Now, everyone rotate around. -Yes. So, while rotating.. ..the moon comes in-between the earth and the sun. The earth cannot see the sun. It seems like the sun has strayed far away from earth. The earth is scared, it's gripped with darkness. The time when sun disappears.. ..is called the solar eclipse. But the sun hasn't disappeared. It's waiting for the moon to move away.. ..so that it can shed his ray of love on earth. And earth smiles once again to see its sun. I..homework.. -Do your homework. Let's go, Shlok. Not from between the earth and the sun. Why is my heart making me restless? Why is it yearning for someone? It desires those moments of happiness again. It has fallen in love with someone. What's wrong with the heart? It desires those bangle-adorned hands again. Wishes someone to talk to him for hours. It desires those feelings at night again. It wishes to feel those delicate lips again. It desires someone to stay in the arms all night. It desires a sweet encounter once again. An encounter. Why does it have so many desires? Why does it mention only your name? It desires someone's love once again. It's expressing desires once again. Why is my heart making me restless? Why is it yearning for someone? It desires those moments of happiness again. It has fallen in love with someone. What's wrong with the heart? What's wrong with the heart? Did you fall asleep while studying? Or are you studying while sleeping. I didn't realise when I fell asleep. I was watching a beautiful dream. I'll show you what beauty is. Come. No, Brother. I'll sit with aunt. No, I want to sit with aunt Nisha. You can't sit with her. -No Today, I'll sit with her. Shlok, Sana. You'll fall down. -Sit down. Isn't she looking gorgeous? Can any boy refuse to marry her today? No boy can ever refuse to marry Nisha. Rajeshwari. We expect the same. Tell me. -Yes. When the ration arrives, have it kept in place. -Okay. We're taking Nisha to the doctor. -Doctor? Why? Nisha was looking fine. In fact, she was looking very nice. That's why we're taking her. To talk about her alliance. Tell me is the MD greater or MBBS? -MD. Yes. The boy is studying for that. Wear that. -Shlok, you wear it too. -Like this, isn't it? Yes. Like that. What ruse have you plotted now, madam? lf you want Rahul to marry her.. ..then why did you tell him.. We're fixing her alliance with a doctor? At times, you've to use crooked means for fair end. And only a person who handles the kitchen.. ..can know that. There's another truth that.. ..men can never understand women. It would've been so much fun.. ..if uncle Rahul had come along too. Isn't it, Aunt? It'll be much more fun if Rahul doesn't come along. What do you mean, Brother-in-law? He means, if Rahul doesn't waste his time around.. ..and tops his engineering exam.. ..that'll be much better, isn't it? Nisha, what do you think of Rahul? Just like you do, Sister. I like him a lot. So, do you? The main course hasn't been served yet. And the dessert too. Aunt Nisha.. Carefully, Sana. You all are back. You'll were late, isn't it? Nisha, Sana, Shlok. Go change your clothes. It's so hot. Sister. -Rahul, has the ration arrived? Yes, Sister. It has been delivered. -Okay. You're sweating so much. -No. Actually, while studying.. What happened, Sister? It's just as I'd expected. That's why we got late. Get me a glass of water. I'm feeling thirsty. Yes, Sister. I.. Sister. Sana's book is in your room. Sister, what did the doctor say? -Operation successful. What? That's what the doctors say.. ..when they're successful, don't they? So..Nisha's and the doctor's alliance has been fixed, right? That means..he has said yes. -Instantly. Just like you did before we left. The truth is..I wanted Nisha to marry you. But that doctor turned out to be more sensible than you. How's that? He didn't say, First education and then marriage. He said Sister.. ..if I fail in the examination, I can reappear. But if I lose a beautiful girl.. It's out. The bangle is loose. I'll just give Sana and Shlok their book.. -Sister. I was thinking. -lf you were thinking. Continue to think. As it's, you've more brains to think. Sister, my mother used to.. When you start building bridge from both sides of the sea.. ..you should make sure that they meet at a point.. ..otherwise, it's useless. Your mother was an engineer too? -Yes. No..I mean.. ..my mother would say, lf you respect your elders.. ..always listen to their advice. And I respect you the most, Sister. So, I'm ready to marry Nisha. Really? -Absolutely, Sister. But that doctor.. -Yes, Doctor.. I've a way to get rid of the doctor. So, Sister..is it final? -Final. The heart wants to rejoice. Wants to create uproar. Happiness has returned to my life. Run around announcing your marriage. The heart wants to rejoice. Wants to create uproar. Happiness has returned to my life. Run around announcing my marriage. Everyone will talk about me. Everyone will talk about me. The day I.. The day I get married, I wonder what'll happen. The day I get married, I wonder what'll happen. Few flowers and a small garland. Ward off all the jinxes. All the guests have arrived. They've arrived. Ironed traditional shirt, polished shoes. I look like a handsome groom. I've arranged for the horses and the elephants. How long do I control myself? The heart's getting restless. Everyone will be present there. The day I.. The day I get married, I wonder what'll happen. The day I get married, I wonder what'll happen. She's here, she's there. Whether it's on land or in the sky.. I see her face everyone. I would've brought her home today. Crowned her as my queen. But look for an auspicious date. I can't resist myself. The girl is still hidden behind the veil. How long will I have to wait? The day I.. The day I get married, I wonder what'll happen. The day I get married, I wonder what'll happen. The heart wants to rejoice. Wants to create uproar. Happiness has returned to my life. Run around announcing my marriage. Everyone will talk about me. Everyone will talk about me. The day I.. The day I get married, I wonder what'll happen. The day I get married, I wonder what'll happen. Yes, Mother. Yes, we've begun the preparations. Yes. Yes. Rahul is preparing as well. Yes, we've fixed an auspicious day a few days from now. Mother, tell Nisha.. ..that we've bought her bridal wear of her choice. Yes, don't worry. Yes. Yes, he has taken leave. For 15 days. Yes. Yes, Mother. Everything is fine. I'll hang up now. Are you Mrs. Saxena? -Yes. I'm Yuvraaj Saxena. I've just joined Godrej as the junior.. Please leave, I don't want to buy anything. Oh, no. You're misunderstanding me. No, I'm absolutely right. These big companies dress up good looking boys and girls.. ..and send them as their salesman. I'm not a salesman. I've been appointed as the Junior Manager in Godrej. -So? Why have you parked the car here? Take it out. Your husband's uncle has sent me. Uncle Gajendra. Take your car out quickly. Quickly. He said that you've a room. I mean I can rent it out. There was, I don't have it anymore. Actually, the mess' food doesn't suit me. I wanted a room for just two months. Actually, the factory's bungalow.. ..will be ready in 2 months. So, I can appoint a cook then. And your family.. -I'm still a bachelor. You're the Junior Manager in Godrej. -Yes. Fixed job. -Yes. And you're going to get a bungalow after two months. -Yes. Is that car yours? -Yes. And you're a Saxena? -Yes. Come on then. You'll have to take one sweet. It's an offering. -Okay. So, why are you still a bachelor? Mummy is looking for a bride. When she finds one, I'll get married. On that note, have one more. I just had this. -This one. That's an offering as well. Come. I was thinking, uncle Gajendra has sent you here.. ..so, it's our duty to help you. Sit down, sit down. So, I suggest that.. you adjust yourself.. ..in the mess for two days. After that, we'll adjust you in our house. Thank you, Sister. These days, people hesitate to rent their room to bachelors. lf it wasn't for you.. I'm helping you because you're a bachelor. What? -I mean, anyone would've easily.. ..helped you'd you been married. You wouldn't need our help then, isn't it? You're right. Only kin help in times of need. That's humanity. Today, we've helped you. Tomorrow, you might be of some help to us. Sister. Sister, I need to finalise from these two cards. This blue one or.. Is..everything fine, Sister? You look worried. You aren't an engineer, but a doctor. You've guessed it right. What's wrong? I wouldn't mind if just one person said it. But the entire neighbourhood is talking about you. And I can't endure it. Sister, tell me clearly.. Mrs. Rai and Mrs. Sharma.. ..say that you've become a live-in son-in-law. Now, I can't charge you rent just to prove them wrong. So, they're right. They don't see what their children are doing. Instead, they pry on others. You know Mrs. Rai's daughter.. What do we care about what they do? But I couldn't endure your defamation. So, I just told them that you don't stay here. You did the right thing. That's the end of the issue. -That isn't the end. They're coming here to see it themselves. And you know Mrs. Rai. Mrs. Rai.. -No, Sister, you..don't worry. I'll make some other arrangements for myself. Okay. But Rahul.. -Yes. Where will you go at such a short notice? I'll..go stay with Shaukat. He's my friend. You'll stay with a betel-leaf seller. That isn't right, then Mrs. Rai.. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone anything. As you wish. They'll be here by 10 o'clock. Fine, Sister. I'll leave by 9:30. Look, I'm telling you again. What you're doing isn't right. And what if Laxmi-Ganesh say it's right? Laxmi-Ganesh.. Last time, Lord Ganesh gave the green signal for Rahul. Yes, so, he was the right choice then. Now, let's see what Lord Ganesh says for Yuvraaj. Laxmi. I knew it will be Laxmi. That means wealthy Yuvraaj will keep our Nisha happy. Rajeshwari, can I ask you something? What if tomorrow.. we find a better.. ..and wealthier boy than Yuvraaj? Then we'll get Nisha married to him. Look, our responsibility is to see.. ..that the boy is nice. lf he's wealthy, Nisha will be happier. And I'll fulfil my responsibility at any cost. Don't keep calling me all day? Otherwise, we'll keep discussing the same topic. Good morning, Sister. Yuvraaj is here, and Rahul is still upstairs. What now? -We'll lose both the boys. What else? No, no. Don't do that. You'll have to help me. -Not at all, I'm going to the office. You're under my oath. -What? Yes, you'll have to help me in this. I don't know anything. You're under my oath. Yuvraaj why did you come so early? You arrived so early, isn't it? -Yes. You asked me to come. So, I thought I'll shift before I leave for office. You did the right thing. You did the right thing. Yuvraaj, this is Surinder. Uncle Gajendra's nephew. -Hello. And this is Yuvraaj, our new tenant. I'll shift my luggage quickly. -Why? Why quickly? Do it slowly. lf there's something delicate like glass or porcelain.. ..it might break. Do it slowly. Help him in getting the luggage. I.. -Slowly. Get up. This isn't the time to sleep. Get up. Get up, they're here. Is that all the luggage you've? -Yes, that's it. Okay. Slowly, what's the hurry? Listen, listen. -Not that way, go out from the rear exit. Okay, fine. Hey. -What? My luggage. My luggage. No. Stand beneath the window.. ..I'll throw it down. -Okay. Don't forget. Can I help? What's the hurry? There must be expensive stuff inside. It might break. Be careful. Careful. Brother. Slowly, you might slip. Carefully. Car. -Car? Ancestral car. -Oh. It's my car. -Really? It runs really nice. -Really? But.. -Slowly, isn't it? Yes. It's small but.. -Runs slowly. Not bad. I don't even need to send it to the garage. -Why? Because it just lies here. -I see. Now, you take care, I'm leaving. Yes. -Go carefully. Yujraaj, come in. It's a very nice room. You can see the rising sun from here in the morning. And you wake up to the chirping of the birds. Come here, take a look. And if you look out the window, you'll see greenery. You'll be able to concentrate on your studies.. I mean you'll be able to concentrate on your work.. ..and reach the top. We don't have any cockroaches or lizards. I don't let them in. I think they're scared of you, isn't it? You're very funny. We'll enjoy your company, Yuvraaj. And listen, have tea, breakfast and lunch with us. Feel at home, okay? Of course. In fact, uncle Gajendra said the same thing. lf you don't mind, can I ask you something? lf I don't mind you'll ask me only one thing. And how many questions will you ask if I do mind. You really are very funny. But I wanted to ask..you're so.. What is it called in English? Handsome. Good-looking. You look just like an actor. Then didn't you think of trying your luck in films? Films are all fake. They're an illusion, a delusion. We belong to the family of freedom fighters. We're the followers of Gandhiji. Mummy says, Simple living, high thinking. What high thinking you've! -They're Gandhiji's. What a high family you belong to? -It's my ancestors. What a handsome photograph you've? Mummy clicked this one. Actually, she clicked three photographs.. ..but mummy says, This looks the best. It's your face, isn't it? -Yes. Even the job. -Yes. You'll be getting the bungalow. -Yes. And you'll get married. -Yes, I'll. But only with mummy's permission. Wow, Rajeshwari. You thought of your uncle Gajendra after a long time. We remember you everyday, Uncle. We just called you today. Actually we wanted to see you and Yuvraaj's mother. Yes. Pick up the phone. Hello. Hello, Mother. -Mother has called. How did Yuvraaj's mother call you? She's talking on the phone. But..you're talking on the phone, son. Yes, but she.. -Yes, talk to your nephew. Just a minute. -Talk to him. -What will I say? -Talk to him. I.. -Talk to him. Hello. -Hello. I can't hear you clearly. -Okay. Hello, hello, hello. -Yes, hello. Hello. Hello. Mother, I..Mother.. We wanted to talk about Nisha's marriage. Listen, please talk to him. -With me. You talk to him. But you're already married to Rajeshwari, son. That's right, Mother. But now, she wants Yuvraaj. What? She's gone crazy. Disconnect it, I'll call her again. Come here. -Just a minute. Mother..I'll talk to mother, you talk to uncle. -Yes. And the network is very weak, hold it right here. -Yes. Hello. - Hello, hello. Hello.. -Hello, Mother. What am I'm hearing? You want to marry some Yuvraaj? -Yes, Mother. He's a very nice boy. Exactly like I wanted. Then..what's wrong with Surinder? Mother..this isn't the time to discuss his drawbacks. Let him be as he's. Just send Nisha here as soon as you can. And yes, listen..don't tell her anything. Why shouldn't I? -She might not be ready? I'm not ready for it as well. Why, Mother? Because I can't send the younger sister.. ..to be the other woman in her elder sister's marriage. What's wrong with mother? I never seen mummy so angry before. And that too with you? It's a new cell-phone. She must've heard it wrong. -Really? That's why, she calmed down.. ..only when brother-in-law called. I asked her, What was wrong? She said Nothing, it was just a misconception. And said Pack your bags and go to Rajjo's house. But what happened, Sister? Nisha, the children's bus must've arrived. I'll go pick them up. Freshen up until then. Yes, that's fine. My hand.. Did you get hurt? Sorry, I thought it was Rahul. -What? Sorry. -What? Sorry. -Sorry. What? -You.. Hello. Listen. Sorry. -Okay. Sorry. -What? I only look at you whenever we meet. My heart feels relaxed when I talk to you. You dwell in me. You're the only one for me. Come fall in love with me. Come fall in love with me. I love only you. Come fall in love with me. Come fall in love with me. You're the relief to my heart. When you're not with me.. Life seems so full of despair. Darkness grips me in broad daylight. My heart says to you..I belong to you. Come fall in love with me. Come fall in love with me. I love only you. Come fall in love with me. Come fall in love with me. You're the relief to my heart. People like to gossip. But when Rahul heard that the neighbours.. ..are calling him a live-in son-in-law.. ..he shifted to another house instantly. Rahul is like that. I thought the boy living upstairs is his friend. No, no. That's Yuvraaj. Yuvi. Remember your brother-in-law's uncle Gajendra? His friend's son. He works in Godrej. He has a fixed job. And next month, he'll get a bungalow. But where did Rahul go? What happened? -Sister, I can't get him on the phone. I don't know why it's showing as unavailable. You try it. -Okay, you can try later. Uncle Gajendra and Yuvi's mother are coming over.. ..for dinner tonight. Let's prepare for that. -Okay. Come on. What happened? Did you finish the balance in your cell-phone.. ..talking to sister-in-law? Not just Nisha, I can't even talk to sister Rajeshwari. I can't get through to this number. -Why? Have you been cut-off? I'm not like your betel-leaves to be cut-off. It's because of these cell-phone companies. They make such big promises.. and when we try to call someone.. ..either the network is missing, or the.. -I got through. Hello. Wrong number. Thank God, we don't have to pay for incoming calls. Otherwise we would've been flat broke.. ..paying for wrong numbers. Wow. Sit down. -You sit down, sister. Sit down, Nisha. Come on. Have some. Dear, what've you prepared? Nisha has prepared everything, Aunt. Whenever she comes here.. ..she doesn't let us do any work. But no one could cook as good as Rajeshwari.. ..and no one can. But it isn't right for a woman.. ..to be engrossed with cooking and cleaning. Isn't it? -Yes, Aunt. Sister Rajeshwari says the same thing. That's why I teach at the village. The children, as well as elders. What are your hobbies? -Learning, teaching.. ..and social-service. Just like you, Aunt. But no one can serve society as Rajeshwari, isn't it? What else do you like? Going out, watching movies and fitting bulbs. Hello. Hello. I said wrong number. It was a wrong number. But the wrong number was on that phone, Mummy. Enough of goodness for a day. Go. Wash your hands, come on. Dear, do you want to ask Yuvraaj anything? -Me? No. Dear, would you like to keep working after marriage, or.. She's.. Nisha is very shy. No one can be as shy as our.. Really, your sister is very cultured. And sweet too. We like her. -And me too. So, is that done? -Absolutely done. And look, the marriage should take place quickly. Yuvi will get a house in a month. And our Nisha will bring the good-fortune.. ..to turn it into a home. And, there's an auspicious date after ten days. A quick wedding and a quicker marriage. Just like our Rajeshwari got married. Please have some sweets. -Yes. Sister, you'll make me fat by feeding me sweets. What's wrong with my heart? So, what is it that you don't like about Yuvraaj? It's not about Yuvraaj, Sister. It's about Rahul. You've fixed my alliance with Rahul. Wrong? I'd fixed your marriage with Rahul. Now, I've fixed it with Yuvraaj. lf she doesn't like your decision.. ..then she has the right to say no. She's naive. She doesn't know what's best for her. And she's angry today. But she'll understand tomorrow. It's such a nice family. No one thinks about money. Stay with aunt Nisha, I'll get the offerings. Did you find out anything about Rahul? Yes, he's close-by. -Where? Will you give me chocolates? -A lot of them. First, tell me where is he. -Finish the veneration first. Shlok. -Finish your circumambulations first. ..just like the earth does around the sun. No one was ever so unhappy to see me. Shall I leave? -Rahul. That's more like it. So, tell me, how are you? When did you arrive? Why didn't you inform me? I know..Sister Rajeshwari doesn't want us to meet. Correct? Where are you going, Mother? For the circumambulations. Why take such a big round? You can do it right here. Like this. And why? -Because the one who takes the shorter round wins. Who said that? -Grandma did. What? -Yes, grandma told me. Grandma said Lord Ganesh took smaller rounds.. ..around Shiv-Parvati because of which He won. Don't go, Mother. Otherwise, I won't get chocolates. How is it connected with the chocolates? Aunt Nisha has said, Keep mother busy here.. ..until she doesn't meet Rahul. Sister Rajeshwari. Come on. Carefully. Sister. Sister, how can you do that? Why? Do I need your permission before doing anything? But Sister, I've made all arrangement for the marriage. Just because you've prepared for engineering.. ..it isn't guaranteed you'll pass. But you were after me. -Fine, I'm not after you now. You don't follow me as well. -Sister, you can't do that. Why? Are you the government.. ..to tell us what we can do? Sister, that's wrong. I won't let that happen. I love Nisha, and she loves me. And you promised me, Sister. You fixed this marriage. So, I didn't sign any stamp paper. Will you drag me to the court? Put us behind bars. Come on, Nisha. Nisha. Let's go. I'm prepared to do anything for your marriage. Yes. Tell me what I've to do. -Nothing, Uncle. Nothing? Son, how will you get married if I don't do anything? Son. Son. Are you crying? - No, Uncle. I.. I can count the feathers of a flying bird. Tell me the truth. Uncle, you reminded me of mother. He's missing his mother. Look, son. Don't worry. I'll do everything. The bride's family is doing everything. You don't have to come. I'm there. Fine, son. But do go to the bride's family.. ..and surely ask them if they need anything. If they need any help, they can talk to me. I'll do whatever needs to be done, Uncle. I won't leave them. Didn't you bring the police along? The police arrest those who commit crimes. What do you mean? - No, I'm here to apologise. I'm here to tell you that what I did was wrong. I don't have the right to question you. You're Nisha's elder sister. You'll know better what's best for her. You can fix her alliance with anyone you want. You can fix it, and then break it. And get rid too of you. That's enough, leave. - No, Sister. I won't leave until you forgive me. And will you leave if I forgive you? So, I forgive you. Go now. Allah, did you really tell Sister-in-law Rajeshwari.. ..that Yuvraaj and Nisha.. - Yes. But you told uncle Rajibali that you and Nisha.. - Yes. Because if I tell him the truth, it'll be chaos here. You mean.. Sister-in-law and Yuvraaj are really.. Do you think I will let that happen? That means you and sister-in-law Nisha.. - Absolutely. I'm just paving a way.. ..so that Nisha and I unite forever. That's why you told sister-in-law Nisha this fact. I didn't tell her. The green betel leaf isn't right. Nisha is very innocent. If she finds out the truth.. ..then she won't be able to keep it from sister Rajeshwari. And my plans will be foiled. So, it's better that only I know about the truth. Do you know what the truth is? Shaukat, the truth is I love Nisha. And only I will marry her. Sister. Why are you carrying these things? Let me carry them. - No, no, I'll carry them. Sister, you know I won't listen even if you refuse. Why are you unnecessarily Don't be stubborn. Let go of this bag, and I'll stop being stubborn. Come. And how are you? - Everything is fine. How are Surinder, Shlok and Sana? - They're fine. How are the preparations for the marriage going? Everything is fine. Cards, musicians, catering.. Have you arranged for everything? No, I mean I was in contact with these people. I discussed with them about the discount too. I was getting a very reasonable rate. After all, I was getting married. Here, Sister. Keep this with you. Take a look at it. No. - Keep it, Sister. Fine, I'll keep it in this. You're my sister. I can do this much for you. I'll drop you, its close-by. - No, no I've reached. We've almost reached home. Okay, fine, Sister. I think you dropped it, Sister? I'm picking it up. I've kept it. 7000 for the cards. Band 2000 for the band. Tent, catering, car. A savings of 18,200 including everything. Rahul can bargain very well. This is for you Sorry. This is mine Sorry. You asked for orange, isn't it? Yes. I was saying, Decorator.. Please can you charge a 1000 rupees less? And in your case, I feel you're charging 500 more. And you If you can charge 100, that'll be best. And if we bargain, then we can reduce a few thousands more. Yes, we might get it for free. Why will they do it for free? They aren't related to us. But we'll save 20,000. I've already spent Rs.20,000. How much more do you want? - 30. Think about that poor boy. He was doing all this for his own marriage. Instead, you're making him do all this for you. To save your 20,000 his heart doesn't shatter into 2 million pieces. So, have you splurged your wealth? What if the plan doesn't work? Look. - Laxmi? Pick up the phone and save wealth. No, I've hit the target. Bull's eye at that. Yes, sister Rajjo. So. Is the deal fixed? - Yes, fixed. Don't change it later. - We might. We'll reduce it. We can reduce the rate if Rahul says so. Isn't it? - Please lower the rate if you can. How much will you reduce it, son? Let them spend some money as well. After all, it's their family wedding. Yes, we've fixed the deal and that's final. I'll pay advance to all of you. - Yes. We've already received the advance. What do you mean? Rahul, Rahul. - He means to say.. ..Rahul's words are enough. You just make the final payment. - Okay. So, on that note, can we have tea and sweets? Oh, yes, of course. - Yes. Until then. I'll show them around the house for the decoration. Come. Please, come. - Come on. I'll show you this part later, and.. - Rahul. Are you going to get a big fat dowry? Please take the measurement. And make him stand at the door, outside. "We've received the advance." Why did you have to open your mouth? Come here. This pillar.. - Yes. Decorate that. - We'll decorate this as well. Go ahead, make me bankrupt. Nisha. Nisha. What are you doing? - Nisha. I expected you to come here, talk to sister.. ..explain to her, create a ruckus. Otherwise, elope with me. Will you elope with me if I tell you to? By tarnishing the honour of your sister.. ..who has done so much for you.. I knew that you wouldn't be able to do it. That's why you're arranging for my marriage, isn't it? How could you imagine that.. ..I will marry anyone else other that you? How can I forget you? Can you forget me? Nisha, don't cry. Believe me. I'm doing the right thing. Sister Rajeshwari only wants the best for you. You won't find a better boy than Yuvraaj. You'll be really happy if you marry him. You should forget me, and think about Yuvraaj. You're absolutely right, I should think about Yuvraaj. A person who can't defend his love.. ..I don't want to think about him. I shouldn't shed tears for someone.. ..who can't think about me. "What's wrong with my heart?" Yes, Prakash. Have you arranged for it? The Saxenas are getting married, no compromise. Please. Rahul. - Yes, Sister. Oh, Sister, sorry. Prakash, I'll call you later. No, you can finish talking to him. - Yes.. No, Sister I'll call you later. Yes. You really are a very nice man. I misunderstood you. I would've really got you and Nisha married.. ..if I hadn't found Yuvraaj. Its okay, Sister. If I can't get married.. ..you'll have to allow me to help you in the marriage. Okay, allowed. - Fine. Now, I'll make this marriage truly memorable.. ..the kind no one has ever seen or heard of. These are the wedding cards. Fresh from the printers Enjoy before they get old and stable. This is Rahul. He's a very nice boy. Sit down, Rahul. - No, Sister. I'm fine. He's like our family member. - Distant relative. But we're very close. You're very interesting. What do you do? At the moment, I'm only interested in your marriage. Once I get that done, I'll think about the future. He knows how to talk. - I've learnt it from you, Sister. I just remembered, you haven't talked about.. ..what you came here for. - Oh, yes. I was saying, you're living in this guest house.. ..though we've our own house. That isn't right. - No. We'll stay here. Otherwise people will say.. ..that Yuvi has become a live-in son-in-law. If he doesn't get married.. ..then he can't be a live-in son-in-law. What do you mean? - No. I mean, they'll call you live-in son-in-law.. ..only after you get married. You aren't married yet, for anyone to talk about that. Isn't it, Sister? - Absolutely. And anyway, Yuvi is quite settled there. So, the shopping, marriage, and the preparations.. ..will go smooth. - Fine. Let Yuvraaj stay there, I'll stay here. And for the shopping.. - At your service. I'll help you in the shopping.. ..and pickup and drop aunt on the motorcycle. You were absolutely right. He's a very nice boy. Look. How is this one? Bride kidnapped from the marriage dais. Show me the fourth one. Bride eloped, but sister-in-law gets married. What's going on in Palanpur? Strange. Yuvraaj. - Mother. Have a lineage of freedom fighters. You all follow the principles of Gandhiji. You fight against social evils. I know a girl who belongs to a similar family. Janvi. Principled. She would be a perfect match for Yuvraaj, but.. For Yuvraaj? But son, Yuvraaj is getting married to Nisha. Show me that second sari? Is this for Sister Rajeshwari? - Yes. Rahul. - Mrs. Rai, how are you? I'm fine. - Are you here to buy saris? Come, sit down. You're buying many saris. For Nisha? - Yes. He's helping us with the shopping. I'm Mrs. Saxena and this is my son Yuvi. - Hello. I'm Mrs. Rai, Rajeshwari's neighbour. - I see. Then you'll have to attend our marriage. Me and Nisha. - Really? But Nisha.. - You're right. She's getting married to Yuvraaj. We lovingly call him Yuvi.. ..that's why you were confused. Show me that sari. - But.. As far as I know, the person Nisha likes.. She'll like the red sari. Show me the red sari. You've given me the green sari. Green again, then brown. What are you doing? - Brown again. Come, Aunt. We'll look at the other counter. - Let's go. He isn't showing it properly? But you did like the sari here. Green, brown, nonsense. I'm stuck, someone get me out of here. Where did they go? Bravo. Mrs. Rai, where are you going? To tell Yuvraaj about me and Nisha. Yes, there's nothing wrong in speaking the truth. Then let me tell you about another truth. - What? Your daughter and the driver are having an affair. - I see. What nonsense! You should keep track of what's going in your house too. If you again try to tell anyone about me and Nisha.. ..then you'll see your daughter and driver's poster on every wall. Bravo. "Put up posters everywhere." Bravo. I bought a lot of things, it was fun. Yes, I would've enjoyed too. If Mrs. Rai hadn't arrived there.. ..and spoiled all the fun. What was she saying? You can never expect such woman to think well of anyone. They only know how to defame people. She was saying "Only sari won't do.." "Nisha is a very fashionable girl." "She'll need matching handbags, sandals, makeup everything." So, I said, "What's wrong with that?" These days every girl likes to stay decked up. But Yuvi, Mrs. Rai wasn't satisfied at that. She was saying "Nisha likes jewellery." "Diamond ring, gold necklace, she'll want everything." I said "What's wrong with that?" "Her in-laws are wealthy." "She'll be their only daughter-in-law." "Who else will they make the jewellery for?" Yes, you're right. Yes. Come, Aunt. She's a very evil woman. There's no limit to the extent she can go to defame someone. She was saying "Nisha gets fits at night." - What? Yes. I asked "Have you entered her bedroom at night and seen it?" "If you haven't gone in her bedroom.." "..then have you heard her screaming?" I did the right thing, isn't it? You did the right thing. Now, the real fun begins. Aunt Nisha screamed, and from our room.. Mummy. - Yes. You run a social service centre, don't you? - Yes. If someone gets fits, does she scream like this? Does she? - Yes, just like this. That means what we heard was right. But Rajeshwari didn't tell us anything. She won't say anything now either, Mummy. She'll come and say that it was a cockroach or lizard. Sister, what happened? - Nothing, it was a rat. Please go and rest. - No, we'll leave now. Then please drop them. - Yes, let's go. Oh, no. Rahul is there. - Yes, I'm there. Okay. - Okay, see you. Okay. Aunt Nisha was scared of a rat. Aunt Nisha was scared of a rat. The children are trained as well. Were you scared at night? - Slightly. Better get used to it now. Now, you'll be slightly scared while sleeping. Why? Because I'm getting married? No. Because you're getting married to Nisha. God knows when she might start screaming. By the way, I salute your courage. You didn't refuse to marry.. ..though you knew the truth. Wow. What can I do? What if Nisha had developed this ailment after marriage? Wow. What a thought! - Not mine, Mother's. I see. I'll have to think of something else. - What for? Marriage. About your marriage. You think so much. "I care about you more than myself." "I talk about you all the time." "I care about you more than myself." "I talk about you all the time." "My darling, my sweetheart." "My heart's filled with your love." "Come steal my heart. "My heart's in a dilemma." "Come steal my heart. "My heart's filled with your love." "Come steal my heart. "My heart's in a dilemma." "Come steal my heart. "No matter how hard you try.." "You can't get me." "Why are you after me?" "My love is the blessings of God." "It's invaluable." "I've come across many like you." "You might have many lovers like me." "But I'm different from all of them." "Why don't you believe that?" "My darling, my sweetheart." "My heart's filled with your love." "Come steal my heart. "My heart's in a dilemma." "Come steal my heart. "My heart's filled with your love." "Come steal my heart. "Shake your feet, lock eyes with me." "Come dance with me." "Shake your feet, lock eyes with me." "Come dance with me." "My heart's shattered." "It's not my heart's fault." "My suit's colourful. Your eyes are so beautiful." "I'm your true lover, my heart's crazy for you." "I can't take my eyes off you." "I shower my blessings on you." "I wish.." "May your life always be filled with happiness." "May your beloved always stay close to you." "May you never be sad." "I won't let you face a dearth of anything." "I'll take all your sorrows." "My darling, my sweetheart." "My heart's filled with your love." "Come steal my heart. "My heart's in a dilemma." "Come steal my heart. "My heart's filled with your love." "Come steal my heart." "My heart's in a dilemma." "Come steal my heart. Yes, come in. Come. Mind the head. Come in, come in. Bring the refrigerator inside. It's a heavy refrigerator. Carefully. Yes. Don't let it fall. Come on. Refrigerator, washing machine, air conditioner.. ..microwave oven, keep all of it carefully. To the left. Keep it down, down. Carefully. Carefully. Okay, thank you, thank you. Andand this diamond ring. Diamond ring. This one. This You keep it. Bravo. Such an lot of dowry. The families of all grooms are like that. First, they say "We don't want dowry." And later they handover a list of their demands. Take a look. They've clearly said that they don't want anything. Then this television, fridge diamond ring. Look, we don't have the stature to give all this. So, don't. Look, everyone was stunned to see that you're giving all this. Especially, Mrs. Rai. Aunt doesn't want dowry. When she refuses, we'll.. - We'll return these things. Correct. I've already discussed it with the shop-owners. Wow. You're so smart, Rahul. So, Sister, I wasn't your first choice without reason! It's a nice plan. But don't end it here. You're still my first choice. We wanted to gift a double-door fridge to Nisha. - Wow. But it wasn't in the showroom. Those who take dowry always say.. "We don't want anything." "Give it to your daughter." People will think you're one of them. We made a big mistake. Have you seen everything? They are the best brands. Rajeshwari. We don't want dowry. - But.. Look. We only want our daughter-in-law. Please return all these things. As you wish, Aunt. Plan two has failed too. Aunt was insulted yesterday. She must be hurt. What did you do? I feel like breaking this alliance. But mummy won't agree. Because it's mummy's duty.. ,,to think about the betterment of others. What is your duty? - To think about mummy. I was telling you. You're getting married in the wrong family. The best girl for you is that principled girl. - I know. She's the right girl for me. But there's no way to break this alliance.. ..and yet maintain mummy's dignity. There's one way. Get yourself kidnapped. - Kidnap? Yes. If the groom is kidnapped on the day of the marriage.. ..then the marriage will be cancelled. And it's neither the groom nor his mother's fault. I'll arrange for you to get kidnapped. But what about poor Nisha? - Don't worry about her. I'm there. - What? I mean, I'm there, I'll handle everything. You'll handle everything, won't you? - Yes. I'll even lay down my life if needed. I'll marry that girl if required. Thanks, friend. Thanks. I'll arrange for an expert kidnapper. I don't want any violence or bloodshed. Everything should be done nicely. Yuvi is a good boy, he.. - Rahul, you don't worry. Really? And what about the money? - Nothing. It'll be your wedding gift from me. Don't consider it a wedding gift, madam. It's a real diamond ring. Speak slowly, everyone is listening. What are you saying? We won't accept a diamond ring from you as gift. I am not going to give a gift. It's worth 100,000. - That's all. It looks so beautiful, it seems like its worth 200,000, Madam, I don't want 200,000. I want only Rs.100,000 of mine. That's all. Yes, and I was coming to you.. ..to pay your Rs.100,000. You do your work. - Yes. But my husband had to go somewhere urgently. And the groom's mother.. She refused to accept the ring. So, now, I'll have to return the ring to you. So, do it. Give it. - Why are you screaming? I'm telling you, I've kept it somewhere. I can't seem to find it. I'll return it as soon as I find it in a day or two. I want my ring, or Rs.100,000. And before the marriage tomorrow. Otherwise, I'll tell everyone. Then whether you get slandered.. ..or the marriage is broken.. Goodbye. What happened, madam? Mind your business, go. You mean to say, I'm a goon.. ..that's why Rahul didn't invite me to his marriage. I'm asking you something, so, answer me. Sir, what can I say? Go see it for yourself. Why didn't you say that before? Sit down. - Yes. Let's go. All set? - Absolutely, smooth like a cake. Bhikulal will be here any moment to kidnap you. Which one is Bhikulal? - Yes. Amongst them? - Yes. Is he amongst them or not? I don't know. I've never seen him before. Bhikulal. Bhikulal. - Wrong number. Bhikulal, you are Bhikulal. Then why are you inquiring about Bhikulal? Don't you see I'm in disguise? Let it be. I'm just checking whether anyone recognises me or not. Okay. - We'll find him. Are you Bhikulal? - Are you mad? Excuse me, are you Bhikulal? Oh, yes, my grandfather was Bhikulal. Are you here with the wedding procession? I've been observing you for a while. This is the tenth one. Come on, get out. If I leave, the groom will leave along with me. - Why? Are you the groom's father? - No. I'm Bhikulal. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Son, son. - Come here. Uncle. - I missed you so much. Uncle. - I missed you. Yuvraaj, Bhikulal. Bhikulal, the groom. - Groom? I came here to see you get married. But someone else is getting married here. Why didn't you tell me all that before? Anyway, it isn't too late yet. I'll kidnap the girl right away. That's why. That's why I didn't tell you. Uncle, Nisha.. - Fine, son. Not the girl, let's kidnap the boy. Uncle, please don't do anything. I've made all arrangements for getting him kidnapped. Please. You too, son. Look. After all, it's in our blood. Uncle, what are you doing? Listen. Sister Rajeshwari. Hello. - Hello. You didn't give this platter yet.. That glass-vase has come back.. Fine, I'll give it. Hello. Shlok. Come here. Are you calling me? Just a minute. Just a minute. Quickly. I'll be back soon. The colour Rahul. - Yes. Please get some ice-cream for Mrs. Rai. She should know what real almonds and raisins taste like. Madam, he's watching. That curtain is not proper. Give this letter only to uncle Yuvraaj. Who? I know I'll give this letter only to uncle Yuvraaj. - Yes. Now, you may go. Go. You called me. Why would I call you? - Nisha, I.. Sister is right. I should marry Yuvraaj. I'll be really happy with him. Do you want to ask anything else? Nisha, I love you. And I won't let you get married to Yuvraaj. Really? - Really. Yuvraaj will be kidnapped right now. And this wedding will stop without much commotion. But why didn't you tell me that before? - Rahul. Coming. - Don't worry, everything will be fine. Rahul. - Coming. Shlok must've given the letter.. 'Yuvraaj, I love Rahul and he loves me.' 'I want to marry only Rahul.' 'But I can't go against my sister.' 'If you refuse to marry..' 'Please refuse to marry.' 'Please.' 'Even if I've to stay unmarried my entire life..' 'But I cannot marry anyone other than Rahul.' Nisha! Excuse me. Has Yuvraaj left? What can I say? - You haven't taken him yet. Now, we'll leave with the bride? - Who? The lover. You tried to explain to me since the past so many days.. ..who the right girl for me is. Now, I understood who the right girl for me is. Who? - Just watch. Come on, come on. - You get lost. The auspicious time is passing by. Call the bride quickly. Priest, start the marriage rituals quickly. Enough of your charades. It's not right to insult him. Leave me. I'm kidnapping you. Uncle. Uncle, what are you doing? Give me this hand. Uncle, what are you doing? - Give it to me. I will take him away. I will take him away. Uncle, don't.. You'll break his hand. -Leave me. I don't want to be kidnapped. And stop this charade. - Charade. Charade? Yes, this is a charade. And this charade has been plotted by.. Rahul. But why would Rahul plot this charade? Because he didn't want me to get married to Nisha. He tried to get me to refuse the marriage. And he hatched a plan to get me kidnapped today. Bravo! There are a lot of charades in their marriages. Is it true, Rahul? Before we call the police.. - Police. Let's get out of here. Better leave. - Excuse me, don't threaten.. Uncle, let's go. Son, our daughter-in-law. - Uncle. Hey, girl, you can't get married. We're kidnapping you. - Why are you giggling then? Go ahead. Pardon us, all this all that.. This marriage.. - This marriage will take place. And Nisha will be the bride. - Yuvraaj is absolutely right. You and Nisha are not at fault for whatever happened. This marriage will take place. Rajjo, go get Nisha. Listen. - What? Nisha.. - What happened to Nisha? Bhikulal kidnapped her. Nisha has been kidnapped. Let's go. Bhikulal kidnapped her. Yuvraaj, where are you going? - Mummy, Nisha.. Inform the police. Sister, Brother-in-law, don't worry. I'll get Nisha back safe and sound. Come on. Hold Hold me. No one will interfere. Rahul will go alone. I've a request. Just like you brought her here safe and sound.. ..please take her back home similarly. And if you have any problem, then I'll take her home. Come on, Nisha. - I won't go. What are you saying? - She's saying that I won't go. You don't come along, that'll be better. Come on, Nisha. Have you gone crazy? - She's being crazy.. Sorry. And you're.. Rajeshwari, have patience. Have faith, everything will be fine. - Hello, Rajeshwari. Rahul. What's the use of going back now? The marriage has been cancelled. It isn't cancelled, everything has gone wrong. I don't understand how Yuvraaj.. What a kick! Is it because of our letter? - Letter? Why did you.. Which letter? Go on. Go and tell everyone.. ..that I stole your ring worth 100,000. And also tell them that I don't have money to repay you. But Sister, why would I say that? Everyone's creating a scene here. So, why not you too? You won't say that? - No. I've found my ring. So, I've come here to return the money. You found the ring? Where? The woman who stole the ring.. ..came to sell it at my shop. When I threatened to turn her over to the police.. Here. But we didn't give this money. Rahul did. You must have sent it. We will have to go back. Sister, Brother-in-law will be worried. No, I won't go back. Sister will get me married to Yuvraaj. - Nisha. Till now, we did everything.. ..so that sister and brother-in-law's honour is not tarnished. If we don't go back now.. Then why did he play this charade? Maybe he didn't know that it would aggravate so much. All he wanted was for the alliance to break.. ..without our honour being tarnished. Otherwise, he could've eloped with Nisha. He could've told Yuvraaj and his mother the truth. And today, he even left without saying the truth. Rahul is such a nice boy. It wouldn't have been bad if Nisha would've married him. Why didn't you stop me? I.. Anyway, there's no use of saying these things. Yuvraaj is here with the wedding procession. Under the pretext of Laxmi and Ganesh.. ..you did as you pleased. As you wished. Now, with the grace of Laxmi and Ganesh.. ..do what's best for everyone. Always stay happy. Bless you. Okay, do keep writing to us. - Yes. Sister. Be careful. And don't eat outside too much. You might fall ill. - Why do you worry so much? Sister, forgive me. - What are you saying? Where is Rahul? - Yes. There's Rahul. He's getting tea for everyone. He's such a nice boy. Very nice. Shall we go? Here. Your love. I am sorry. For everything. - No. Everything is fair in love and war. I was in a fit of rage. But I can't stay angry all my life. - How true. Not me, mummy says that. Why don't you say something? Go on then. I let Nisha go once because of sister. I won't let her go again. Bye. Vishal Saxena. Hey, buddy, how are you doing? I just arrived from America after finishing my engineering. Marriage? Oh, no. Not there, I want to marry someone from here. No, no, my house is being repaired. So, I'm looking for a place on rent. Sister.. No, Sister, this marriage is final. Bye, aunt. "The heart wants to rejoice." "Wants to create uproar." "Happiness has returned to my life."
