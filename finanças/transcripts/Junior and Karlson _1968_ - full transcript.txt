Inspired by Astrid Lindgren's fairy tale. Karlsson and The Kid Voice over: The Kid - K. Roomyanova Karlsson -V. Livanov Fido! Fido! Here, boy! What did I say? Sit! Tell me please, do you always have to fight? You can resolve any argument with words. Sure you can! Easy for you to say. For example, you two have each other. And I've got no one! No one! Not even a dog... Excuse me, requesting permission to land What? What what? Can I land here? Can't you see I'm running out of fuel? Go ahead, please. OK. Let's continue the conversation. What's your name? Mine? Of course yours, not mine! Kid. Just Kid? No! You should do it like I do. I'm Karlsson, who lives on the roof! - Sounds good, doesn't it? - It does. But don't worry about it. You can simply call me Karlsson. - Let's try! Hey Kid! - Hey Karlsson! See! Let's continue our conversation. How old are you? Seven. Only seven? And I thought eight. What are you looking at me for? Why don't you ask how old I am? I'm very sorry, how old are you? I'm a man in the prime of my life and at the height of my powers. Really? And at what age do you reach the height of your powers? When, you know... Let's not talk about it! Can I press that? Help yourself! Press it! Stop! You got any jam? Yes, I have. Let's have it, then! Should I press it again? Go ahead! Hey, Kid! You'll never be bored with me, will you? Ha-ha! What are you doing? Ah, just a little bit of monkey business, mucking about. But it will fall down! Don't be alarmed, all'll be fine! It did fall down! 'pon my word! Did you see that? Smashed into pieces! Yeah! But I wonder now, what will my Mum say? Well, Mums. That's life! I'll give you 10 000 lamps tomorrow. Hey, let's muck about! I can imagine how angry Dad will be! Dad? What about him? Really? I'd better be flying! Don't be alarmed, all'll be fine! What's happened here? A mere trifle! Things happen! That's right! He'll bring 10 000 lamps! No bro, you must shoulder the blame and not shift it onto a certain Karlsson! Right you are, Dad! We'd better hurry or we'll be late for the film. Shame on you! Listen Mum. My brother'll grow up, get married one day, then he'll die Will I have to marry his old wife, then? Why, darling? 'Cause I have to have to have all his hand-me-downs: pyjamas, bicycle, skates ... and the rest I promise, I'll do everything to rid you of his old wife. That's good, but I'd rather have a dog, than a wife Don't be alarmed, all'll be fine! Karlsson! - Karlsson! - Hey, kiddo! That's so wonderful that you came! Sure it is! Karlsson, my Mum's strictly forbidden me to touchthe jam. You get so nasty, when the sickest person in the world wants to have a couple of spoonfuls of jam Are you sick, really? I've got the highest temperature in the world! - Really? - Yes, really! if you need to know You know what, you have to become my mother! Listen, I don't think you are sick - Of course I am! - No, you are not! - I'm telling you I am - No, you are not! You're so difficult! Can't I get sick like everyone else? Do you want to get sick? Like you don't! Nope Everyone wants it! You're just lying in b... Listen, let's go to my place! I'll lie in bed, and you'll ask me how I'm feeling And tell you: "I'm the sickest person in the world... and I need nothing, but maybe just a huge cake, loads of chocolate and ... some kind of enormous bag of sweets." That's it! "I'm upstairs, at Karlsson's, who lives on the roof." Hey! What happened? Nothing, we're just flying Wait! You've forgotten about the jam! No, it's here! Listen, you've left the sweets! No, they are here too! Don't press on my neck! Karlsson, who lives up on the roof Welcome, my dear friend ... ... Karlsson. Well, you can come in too. You gave me pins and needles in my neck! I almost forgot that I'm the sickest person in the world! Why are standing there like a spare part? You were going to become my mother! Well? Um, do you have any medicine in here? What are you talking about? You've brought everything with you? Does it help? Really? You start and you'll see! Oh, I'm the sickest person in the world! So? Is there a bit of jam left? No, it's all gone All gone? Not even half a teaspoonful left? No, none at all. Too bad. Wondrous thing! A friend's saved a friend's life! Our dear Karlsson's got a normal temperature now and ... And he deserves to sky lark a bit! Hey, Kid! Let's stroll on the roofs. What for? What do you mean "what for"? To seek adventures! Don't be alarmed, all'll be fine. We got lucky with the weather today,... Quiet! Shh! Look to your left, see the two guys? you know who they are? What do you know! They're filchers! They're planning to commit a dastardly crime on the roof! Boo! Are you scared? I'm not! As much as I thought! What should we do? Eureka! Let the lesson begin! Now, you'll see the best ghost in the world with a propeller! So wild! But so cute... Stop shouting! People are sleeping! Mama! Don't be alarmed, all'll be fine! I'll catch you ... and we'll laugh! Drop the washing! Drop it now! Listen, Kid! Do you know what the best remedy for filchers is? A ghost, of course. Hey, Kid! Look! The firefighters came for you! There they are clambering up! Listen, I feel homesick all of sudden And you've kept me up here for too long, it's time for me to sleep. Cheers! I'm off You scared us half to death! Why would you worry about me? Of course we would! Think for yourself: What would've happened if you'd fallen off the roof? - Would it be good? - No. What would've happened, if we'd lost you? Would you be sad? Sad... You know yourself that we wouldn't give you up for all the money in the world! Even for hundreds of thousands of millions? Even for hundreds of thousands of millions! That's how much I'm worth! Of course, you silly boy! Dad...Daddy! Why aren't you in bed? Don't be scared, Dad. I was thinking, if I'm really worth hundreds of thousands of millions ... Could I get at least a little bit in cash to buy a little puppy? About that puppy I should say that... What? It seems that I'm going to live like this my whole life ... ... without a dog. Can you imagine? Eight years ago, when you came into this world you were this small! Daddy, will I not get a dog? Good Heavens! Don't be alarmed, all'll be fine! I don't want to play like that! I decided to cake an opportunity to take an opportunity to wish you a Happy Birthday Aren't you happy to see me? Hello, Karlsson. Hey, Kid! What are you going to treat me with? With a pie. A pie with what? with eight candles! Oh no, I don't eat that. One pie and eight candles ... Eight pies and one candle is much better! Right? Believe me, Karlsson. Cakes can't buy you happiness! Are you out of you mind? If not that, then what? They aren't going to give me a dog... What? A dog? What about me? Hey Kid, I'm better than a dog, much better. No? Sorry, Karlson. Will you wait a second? It's a... It's dog! A dog! A dog! Karlsson! Karlsson! They gave me a dog! Karlsson? Where are you? The end
