After 10 days, during which this rescue mission has sadly become a recovery operation, we have concluded... that to continue this search would be futile. We're looking at this as a suicide, but we still don't know what really happened. I know what happened. Detective Hatcher, the defendant, Robert Savich, has been presentedto this court as the proprietorof an import/export enterprise. Do you have any knowledge of his involvement in any other business? Yes, the drug trade. And what was the profession of the murder victim, Freddy Morris? Freddy was a drug dealer. He worked for the defendant. He was also a snitch. What does "snitch" mean, exactly? Objection, Your Honor. Relevance? Overruled. I'd like to hear the detective's definition. A snitch provides police with intelligence on a suspect's criminal activities. And did Mr. Morrisprovide intel on the defendant'snarcotics activities? He did. When you foundMr. Morris dead, what condition was he in, specifically? Specifically, he was was shot in the head. He had his tongue cut out of his mouth, and the medical examiner said it probably happened while he was still alive. Afterwards, did you ventureto the defendant's office - to question him? - I did. Let myself in unannounced. And Mr. Savich was with a woman who was on her knees in front of him, and you-- you get the picture. I believe we do.Please continue. There was a gun on his desk, and I knew if he got to that weapon, I'd be a dead man. Objection, Your Honor. Conclusion. Sustained. Thank you, Judge. Detective Hatcher, did you fear for your lifewhen you saw the gun? Of course I did. I subdued him, and I let the woman get away. And she took the gunwith her? Girl took the gun with her, yes. And neither-- neither had been seen since. Your Honor... some important information has just come to light. May we meet in your chambers, please? They've been in there 30 minutes. What do you thinkthey're talking about? Plea bargain, maybe? Savich wouldn't copto a parking violation. Detective Hatcher's rule number five-- it ain't over till it's over. Damn straight. Seven-letter word for "surrender"? Abdicate. That's eight letters. Stop staring. How's the judge get a wife like that? All rise. Okay. Please be seated. I don't have a good feeling about this. Defense counsel has informed me that during voir dire, juror number 10 failed to disclose that her son was enrolled in the police academy. She didn't intend to deceive the court but failed to recognize how such an omission could affect the outcome of this trial. What? Defense counsel feels that juror number 10 may have an inherent bias against any defendant, especially one accused of such an egregious crime. And I agree with counsel on this point... No. ...and regrettably am compelledto declare a mistrial. Jurors, you are hereby dismissed. Mr. Adams, your client is free to go. You're gonna let this guy walk? Are you joking? You see me laughing, Detective? You blew it again, Hatcher. I'll be in touch real soon. You just gave this guy a passto go kill again! Detective, you are a decorated officer. Try behaving like one. Why don't you act likea judge? Detective, you are in contempt of this court. Deputy, take him away and put him away. This court is adjourned. - Just relax. - I got it. I got it. Whoo! Jail stink. Nothing worse. Did you seeany of our friends? Oh, yeah. It's a constant party in there. Saw old "Fat Face" Chuck. He said to say "hi," by the way. Really? I always actually kind of liked him. That's good, 'cause he really likes you. How come your alarm wasn't set? I keep forgetting the code. Well, set it, okay? He said he's coming after you. You know, the captain isn't too happy about what went down in court. Oh, you think I am? Remember when we got Savich for trafficking? Yeah, that acquittalwas messed up. How about homicide? Actually, the charge wasvehicular manslaughter. Just sayin'. He ran over the guy 12 times. I call that homicide. Yeah, well, hung jury didn't know what to call it, so he walked. He bought that jury. You're obsessed. Damn right. Hatch, the D.A. Isn't re-trying the case. What? No, wait. You know what? I don't care. Liar. You docare. Deeply.That's what I love about you. Hey, did you just say "love"? Shut up. When are you gonna playsomething for me on the piano? I don't play anymore. Hatch, Brenda's been gone for, what, two years now? How long are you gonna keepmoping around? Hey. All right. All right. Well, get in the showerand go get pretty. We got to get going. W-where are we going? Awards dinner. No. No, no, no, no, no. No. No. Your commendation.Yeah, come on. - I'm not-- - We're going. That's that. Now, give me a diet colafor the road. Caffeine freak. - Hey! Hey! - What? What? What is it? I think we just found Freddy Morris' tongue. Is that you? - Clear! - Clear. Just Savich playing games. No, this is a warning. This guy, he gets off on your obsession with him, and that makes you a target. Hatch, he just got access to your home. Set your alarm, damn it. Every day. I promise. All right, go take a shower. I'll call in the tongue. Promise me you won't get drunk and do something stupid tonight. Sure.Hatch. Deedee. Whoa.You're in a dress. You look amazing. - What the hell happened? - Piss off, Worley. Just saying. Bob Worley compliments me, but you haven't said a word on how I look. What? You look nice. It's too late. Can I get a tequila on the rocksand a diet cola, please? Ah, Detective. No hard feelings, I hope. For the jail time? I only have myself to blamefor that. Good answer. Hello, there, Michelle. Give me a Rob Roy. Yes, sir. - What'd he say? - He said you look hot and he can't figure out why we're not having sex. Well, I hope you told him it's 'cause I like sex thatlasts more than 60 seconds. - Mm! - Mm! It gives me great pleasure to introduce our next honoree, a man of integrity and courage, and a mentor to his fellow officers-- Detective Sergeant Duncan Hatcher. Thank you, Captain Gerard. Thank you, everybody. I, um... I can't really accept this award because I didn't crack that case. The one who solved it is someoneI'm proud to call my-- my friend and my partner, Deedee Bowen. Deedee, come on up here and accept this award. This is yours. Come on, give it up for Deedee, everybody. Come on. Take this. So now you're gonna goget drunk? Thank you so much. Mrs. Laird. Hi. Duncan Hatcher? That was a very nice thing you did back there. I'm not always nice. You knowwhat pisses me off? Apart from my husband? Mm-hmm. A woman who's... too beautiful... for me. How sad. A hero who underestimates himself. Good night, Detective. Hey, um... When will we seeeach other again? We won't. Yes, we will. Any judgethat sends me to jail, I make it a pointto seduce his wife. Hey. Hey. Why is itafter a few drinks you turn intosuch a complete ass? Who the hell are you? Hey, Deedee. Something's gone down at the Laird house. - A shooting. - What? W-why-- why you got all thesebaseball cards in here? I collect them. Why? Is that a problem? No. I didn't thinkwe had secrets. You okay? You feel funny about this? I mean, you and the judge-- Just 'causewe got a history doesn't meanI want him dead. Uh, the shots woke me up, and I ran as fast as I could, and that's-- that's when I saw my wife, slumped in a chair. Lord, sometimes I think Savannahis nothing more than a swamp. What do you got? .38 caliber, straight through the heart, frontal entry. The CSI boys are in there now trying to get a name off the guy. You got the shooterin custody? What? The shooter is Mrs. Laird. Watch your step. Anything? He jimmied a window to get in. They found a tire iron under some bushes. No car keys, no money, no I.D. And supposedly, neither the judge nor his wife recognize him. Let's go talk to them. Mrs. Laird, please go overeverything that happened. Things got hotin the Jacuzzi, so we went upstairsto make love, and she forgotto turn on the alarm. Judge, please, you're sitting in as a courtesy. Now, Mrs. Laird? Well, you heard my husband. And then at around 12:30, I came downstairs to get somethingto drink. Every night. Chronic insomnia. This is not your courtroom, Judge. It's a crime scene, okay? Mrs. Laird? I was in the kitchen, getting myself a glass of milk, when I heard a noise. I grabbed the gun from the drawer. Why didn't you call 911? I should have, I know. If I had to do it again, I would. I own several guns.She knows where they are. I had her take lessons to learn how to use them properly. If you don't shut up,I'm gonna throw you outof your own house, okay? You got it? You're a good shot, Mrs. Laird. Now, can we continue? You get the gun and... Who the hell are you? I was so scared. I couldn't believe what I had just done. And that was it? Yes. And you said you found your wifeslumped in a chair. So I'm allowedto talk now? Yeah. Please. Ah... I thought she was dead.And I ran to her. And that's when I saw the manon the floor. Elise was in shock, but it was clear that she had interrupted an attempted burglary. Okay, we might have morequestions in the morning. But that's enough for tonight.Thank you. Sorry to put you through this, Mrs. Laird. Judge. Just doing your job.I'll see you out. Actually, Judge, there's just one more thing I'd like to check out in the study. Do you mind? I won't be long. Okay. I was drunk. And, uh-- and angry and... I know it's no excuse for what I said. I just wanted you to know that it wasn't-- it wasn't about you. Hmm. Wasn't it? Yeah, you're good. Come on, come on. Elise... This is a nice surprise. I need a favor. Cindy, will you give thisto Jackson when he comes in? - Sure. - Thank you. Hey, everybody. - What's up? - Hey. They identified the bodyfrom the Laird house. Gary Ray Trotterfrom Baltimore. Small stuff.And no burglary charges. All of a sudden, the guy's a burglar? Yeah, and why rob a homewithout gloves or tools of the trade? Just a handgun? Makes no sense. Mrs. Laird's hiding something. Then there's the trajectoryof Trotter's bullet. See, it doesn't matchher story. His round, it went straight up. So, what we got on the Laird case? We were just talking about that. Sounds like to me a burglarshot in the act, right? Maybe not.We're checking it out. Sorry for showing up unannounced. We just need to clear up a few things. Overnight, is there anythingthat you thought of that you might have left out? Apparently I didn't get the memo. What now, Hatcher? Your captain's already told me this is being wrapped up. We just need to clarify a few things. The dead man-- his name's Gary Ray Trotter. Repeat offender. He ever end upin your courtroom? Maybe he had a grudge? No. I've never seen him before. Why would he burglarize your home? I'm rich. Look, all I know is that this man tried to kill my wife. You sure he shot first, Mrs. Laird? Yes, that's what I told you. The trajectory of Trotter's bullet, it suggests otherwise. This is the way we see it. Who the hell are you? Of course he fired first. After the trauma that my wife has been through, you're gonna stand there and accuse her of lying to you? Our apologies. We just had to check. Thank you.We'll see ourselves out. Detective Hatcher? Can I have your card? In case I remember any other details. Thank you. - Hey, give me the keys. - Hatch, I'm driving. Just give me the keys. I'm driving. Deal with it. I don't believe a word she says. She's pretty. You think? I saw how you twowere eyeballing each other. Think with your brain, okay? You know what I see when I look at her? One lonely person. Funny. That's what I seewhen I look at you. Guess what I found outabout her. She was a waitress athis country club when they met. But before that, she was a waitress at a low-rent strip cluboutside of town. Every strip club's low rent. I wouldn't know. She killed Trotter for a reason, but it wasn't burglary. Well, her marriage to the judgesure raised some eyebrows. She has her critics out there.And enemies. She gives women a bad name. Wow. Kung Pao chicken. Put in some money, or get lost. Meyer Napoli has gone missing. That private investigator? That scumbag? Yep. A lot of people didn't like him very much. Then you should have a lot of suspects. Yes, I will. Why didn't you reply to my note? You got somethingto say to me, you come down to the precinct, okay? Got that? It's too sensitive. Did you tell your partner about my note? No. Come here. This better be good. I know why Gary Ray Trotter came to the house. He was hired to kill me. By who? By my husband. Why would Cato Laird want you dead? I can't tell you that. I risked a lotby coming here. Cato left the house early toplay golf at the country club, so I came to youbecause-- I underestimate myself? No. Because I trust you. Really? The guy who said he wanted to sleep with you? A hit man? Come on. Why would your husband want to knock off the woman who gets him all hot and steamy in the Jacuzzi? You're a bastard. Yeah, I can be. Don't speak. Yeah? Worley found a Post-It notein Napoli 's office with the name"Gary Ray Trotter" on it. Maybe we should talk to Laird. Napoli's been a witness in his courtroom. Pick me up in 30. Come on, talk. I always set the alarmbefore going to bed. That night, Cato stopped me from doing it. Before or after the hot sex? He wanted Trotterto get into the house. After I was dead, he could truthfully say that he had prevented mefrom setting the alarm, blaming himself, winning everyone's pity. It's brilliant. He has you all fooled. Oh, please. If I'm gonna buy this sob story, I got to hear a motive. So give me one. I can't risk telling you, not yet. Hey, this isn't a game! You went into that study to kill Trotter. You fired first. It's called murder. You know, I made a mistakecoming here. Yeah, you're right. 'Cause you thought we'd end up in bed together and I 'd drop the investigation. Unh-unh. You can leave now. You have tolet go of me first. - Is he eating alone? - Supposedly. Detectives. Well, even you can't spoil my mood today, Hatcher. I just shot the best round of my life. Join us? "Us"? My wife insisted on celebrating with me. Ah, there here she is. Hi, sweetheart. Detectives. This is a surprise. Ever heard of a private investigator named Napoli? Yes. Uh, he's been in my courtseveral times as a witness. Why? Mrs. Laird, do you know him? No. I've never heardof him. The man you shot and killed made an appointment to see him, but his secretary says Trotter never showed up. What are you implying? Don't you find it odd that after Trotter is killed in your home, his name ends up on the desk of a P.I. who happens to havegone missing? Ever had any contact with Napoli outside of the the courtroom? No. None. Where were you this morning, ma'am? She was at home. Look, my wife and I have told you all that we know, so if there isn't anything else... Nothing else. Enjoy your lunch. I will. - He's lying. - Yep, and what was that "Where were you this morning?" All about? Trying to trip them up. They're both lying. Hey, no secretsbetween partners. You taught me thatmy first day. - What, you think I'm holding something back? - You tell me. I'm gonna stick around here and keep an eye on them. Go see if you can help dig up something on Napoli, find out if he's dead or alive. And ifhe's still breathing? We'll have a little chat with him. Yes, darling. Hello? Hey. You tell me he's here to getme here, then you waltz in? What, are you trying tothrow me off my game? No. No, I'm here to help, in case he lies. What about your lies?I've been watching you. He sure doesn't look like a mantrying to kill his wife to me. Oh, but I look like a killer? You areone. - You're still here? - Just leaving. I need to speak with you privately. Okay with you? Of course. I'll be in my office. What'd he say to you? He thinks you're covering something up. Are you? Hello, my lovely. Did you getwhat I asked for? Tomorrow night at the club. Robert Savich always delivers. Should have told you this before, but... I couldn't say anything about Napoli in front of my wife. I hired him. To follow her. I thought she was having an affair. Satisfied? Was she? Yes, but then I decided to... not do anything about it. I love her, and... I don't want to lose her. Who was the affair with? Coleman Greer. Coleman-- Coleman Greer, the baseball star? The onewho killed himself? You want to have sex with my wife, don't you? If I said no... you'd be insulted. I don't usually pick up womenlike this. I picked youup, remember? Oh, yeah. Hey, what wasyour name again? Yeah? One of Savich's dope dealers was booked for assault. Gordon Ballew. Eh, maybe we got lucky and Gordie's ready to deal. I'll be right down. Hey... I got to go do a work thing. Yeah. Me too. Savich wants to knowif you're a good lay. What? I'll tell him you were okay. - Savich? - Smitty's is a total dive. How could you pick someone up in that dump? She picked me up, and I don't need a lecture. I got to get my house checkedfor bugs now. Yeah, well, you better get yourself checked, too. Yeah, Gordie? I got to go to the bathroom. Me too. We're gonna book youon second-degree murder. You know that, right, Gordie? What? I just hit him with a bottle. I was high. He called me "shorty." I hate that. It's all right. Relax. The man you assaulted last nighthas been treated and released. Talking about Freddy-- Freddy Morris, one of Savich's boys. I had nothing to do with Freddy. Look, Savich scares me. And if Freddy had been smarter, he-- He what? Would have been scared, too? Wouldn't have been cooperating with us? Is that what you're saying? What? What do you want? I want Savich. You give him to me, something that sticks. I'm gonna make all your problemsgo away, brother. Is that what you told Freddy? I'd like to keep my tongue, thank you. You ready? What's up? Elise Laird was having an affairwith Coleman Greer. What? When did you find that out? Yesterday. Wait, and you didn't call me immediately? Is there anything else you're holding back? No. Nothing. Okay, if Elise Laird had something to do with Coleman Greer's suicide, I'm gonna kill her. Spoken likea true baseball fan. All right, look, I want to get her in here alone, see if there's anything to this. If you get her here alone,I'll give you 10 bucks. Say, make it $20. I didn't think Cato knew about my relationshipwith Coleman. And I didn't knowhe was having me followed. Now, just so we're clear, I was not having an affair with Coleman. We were friends, since high school. You expect us to believe that you and Coleman Greer were sneaking around from one hotel to the next and you're not...? My supposed sex lifedoes seem to intrigue you. What does Coleman have to dowith any of this? Napoli was blackmailing you about this affair, sent Trotter to your place to collect the money, and that's why you killed him. Right? To keep your little sugar daddy. My, you detectives havequite the imagination. Are you arresting me? Not today. Have a nice day. I know those eyes. They're the "I want to get you into bed" eyes. She was flirting with me. You owe me 20 bucks. I just got a messagefrom one angry judge. Any ideawhy he's calling? I have contacts, Detective, all over the place, so I learn about thingsquickly, including when the policedrag my wife into the station house. Good for you.Why are wehere? I felt we should clear the air, all around. Now, I 've told Elise about hiring Napoli to follow her. I'm not proud of that. Now, I deeply regret my business with him, especially if it led to the shooting of Mr. Trotter, no matter how roundabout the connection was. But I'm hopingthat by being open with you, we can put this regrettableincident behind us. Tell them what you told me. I was a shoulderfor Coleman to cry on. He was depressed. His boyfriendwas leaving him. Wait. Boyfriend? Tell them everything. Coleman was gay, and he was in love withhis teammate Tony Esteban. No way. Hey, let's just be objectivehere, okay? Shut up. Look, everything Elise Laird says is a lie. She has that judge wrapped around her little finger. And you know what? I think she's pretty close to having you wrapped around it, too. Oh, yeah? You got something tosay about how I'm doing my job, just say it. Hatch, be careful. All right? That's all I'm saying. Be careful. Okay. Note to self-- be careful.Got it. Let's go. How does it feelto be back? Feels like a lifetime ago. Hatch doesn't believe a word I'm saying. Oh, you'll convince him. One personnel file, straight up. A real-life hero. Master's degree in criminology.Son of a Baptist preacher. And a bitof a righteous rogue, which meansyou're in a tight spot. What's going on in thatpretty little head of yours? Revenge. What are you looking for? The repairman didn't doa good job on the bullet hole. I was just looking forthe contractor's card to have it re-done. Got something for you. A dress. Upstairs. You go to Atlanta alone? Without telling me? And did it ever occur to you that I would have liked to have met Esteban? He's on my fantasy team! Let's stick to the case. So, what do we think? I'll tell you what I think. Coleman Greer wasn't gay, and neither is Esteban. Deedee, I met the guy.He's gay. Captain, here's the way I see it. Napoli-- he knows aboutColeman and Esteban, so he's blackmailing themthrough Elise Laird. She shoots Trotterto save Coleman's career. I don't think this issome burglary gone south. And maybe Mrs. Laird is also involved in the disappearance of Napoli. All right. Let's get the Lairds in here in the morning, 10:00. Tell them to lawyer up. You got it, Captain. Tony Esteban signed cardright there. And that's supposed to stop me from being pissed off at you. His penmanship sucks. All right, what's your motive, Hatch? Same as yours. Solve the case. Elise? What's taking you so long? I want to see youin that dress. You have great taste. Hello? Judge, it's Hatcher. Detective. What now? The captain wants you and your wife to come down to headquarters tomorrow, - 10:00 a.m. - Why? I don't know. You're the judge. Figure it out. You might want to bring an attorney. I just might do that.Thank you, Detective. What is it? Don't worry. I'll take care of you. I lied. Whose house is this? It belongs to a friend. It's not about Savich. I figured using his name would get you here. What, you sneak out on your husband? He wentto the country club. Look, please, just--just put away your gun. I shot Trotterin self-defense. That's the truth. You lied to get me here. And now I'm telling youthe truth. I talked to Tony Esteban about you. He don't like you very much. Yeah, well, I don't like himvery much, either. I met him at a party once. Yeah. He told me about the party. You got naked, and then you stalked him. Oh, right.And you're gonna believe that? More than I believe you. Tony came on to me. He has issues.I did nothing with him. He treated Coleman badly. Oh, he treated Coleman badly, but Coleman still was in love with him, right? I don't think we get to choosewho we fall in love with. Do you? See, when I first met you, I thought you shot Trotter to save Coleman's career. Then I figured you did it to save yourself. What did Napoli have on you, huh? Pictures, videos? Do you even care? Here's how I think it went down. Your husband-- he pays Napoli off, but Napoli is an enterprising scum. So he comes after you for more dough, sends Trotter to collect. You shoot him. Your husband buys that self-defense story. Now we're down to Napoli, huh? He's the only way that can ruin it. Where's he? I get it right? What's it gonna taketo get you to believe me? What, turn up dead? Yeah, that'd be a start. Please. Pleasestop investigating me and start investigatingCato Laird. Oh, come on! Why would he want youdead? I can't tell you that. Not until I know for surethat you believe me. - Then you're out of luck. - Hey! Hey! Don't leave. Please. I know you have feelingsfor me, and... I feel-- You know, you can stop acting now, 'cause you got what you wanted. My career is probably over. So is this case. Captain's gonna have my ass. Well, that's not what I wanted. Well, it's what we got, okay? 'Cause I crossed the line. I got to come clean. You know what's crazy? If I had the chance, I'd do it again. Even if you are a murderer. Please... Please, I'm in danger.You have to believe me. Be at the station tomorrow at 10:00. Lawyer up and don't be late. Hello, Mrs. Laird. My name is Meyer Napoli. Start the car. Drive. Hello? When? Okay, thanks, Tony. We'll be right there. - Morning. - All right. What's wrong? They just found Napoli dead. I'll bet you 50 bucks that bitchElise Laird is involved. They just found his bodynext to a car registered to her, and she's missing, too. - Hey. - Hey. What do we got? We got a license, purse. - Hatch. - What you got? It ain't pretty. A gunshot to the abdomen, close range, probably bled out. All right. Thanks. All right, they found a purse, wallet inside, and an I.D. belongingto Elise Laird. And a woman's sandalright there. What's it gonna taketo get you to believe me? What, turn up dead? Hey, Gus, let me see those. Well, look at that. What is it? I don't know.Piece of a clothing, maybe. What's the story? What happened? Where's my wife? Tell me what happened. We don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Judge, you recognize this? It's from my wife's dress. Was she pushed? Or did she jump? However it happened, she ain't alive. Okay, guys, this case is our number-one priority. I mean, how the hell does Napoli get to Elise Laird? Huh? Kidnap her from the house? No sign of a struggle there. Napoli's dead. Where's Elise? Well, we've got choppers, dive teams, and K9 units looking for her. Maybe she shot himand then jumped. What? Why would she want to kill herself? Judge, you know what? It's not good for you to be here with all this.Maybe you should go home. Don't you worry about me, Detective. All right, ballistics confirmedthat the .380-caliber pistol used to kill Napoliwasn't his. Napoli's gun was a .38. What does that mean? That means your wife was armed. We checked your house. One of the guns you listed is missing, the .380. I don't believe this. You people think that my wife left our house on her own with a gun in order to meet up with this man and kill him? Judge, I thinkyou should go home. When we have some news, we'll--we'll let you know. Elise did not kill herself. You find her. Worley, see if you can find outwhere Napoli was before he met up with Elise, okay? I'm on it. What are you thinking, Captain? I think her life went from good to bad real fast. This thing with Trotter could wash down to self-defense, but no matter what happened with Napoli, that gives her a second dead man on her hands. Even if she didn't go to jail, Laird's life is finished, his career is finished, and so is her fancy way of life. Maybe she jumped because she wanted to end it. You all right? I'm just kind of exhausted. This case and... and complications. Two victims died staringat the face of Elise Laird. That's not complicated, Hatch. You have feelings for her, right? Isn't thatwhat's going on? How's it going? Couple days, still nothing, huh? Well, the captain just told the media that the rescue operation is now a recovery mission. We really messed this one up. No. We're still following leads. Worley found a taxi driver who took Napoli to Miss Laird's Mercedes. CSI found a tracking device planted in her car. We're making headway. And the judge just offered a reward to help find her. Hey. We got a witness who saw Elise Laird with Robert Savich the night before Napoli 's murder. With Savich? Who's the witness? It was last week. The day I got arrested. Saw Mrs. Laird at the White Tie & Tails. The strip club. She was with Savich, talking. They seemed, like, real friendly. You're lying, Gordie. You just want that reward money. I don't buy the Savich connection. You don't always think straightwhen it comes to Savich. It was postmarked the day that Napoli was murdered and my wife disappeared. It was in a pile of mail that's been sitting there. This is why Napoliwas blackmailing your wife? I got a witness that saw herwith Robert Savich a week ago, but these... these were takenover a period of time. It would appear so. Since he sent these to me, I suppose he intended to do the same thing in my case. He must have stumbled on these when he was following Elise for me. Coleman Greer--that's one thing. But Robert Savich? That's another. That son of a bitch. You let him walk, Judge. My wife is dead, isn't she? I don't know. I'm gonna talk tomy witness again. Maybe... maybe he can remembersomething else. I don't think so. Gordon Ballew's dead. You hadGordie Ballew killed? I didn't know you and Gordie were so close. You sent her to me? The brunette? Elise. Why would that even occur to you? Is your self-esteem that low? Is that what I've done to you? You sent her to me, and then you kill her? You're unraveling, Detective. You're enamored with a ghost. Maybe Napoli made it quick. You found me. Well, I ama cop. Yeah. A good one. And by the book. Learned from the best. She got to me from the start. You know, Elise came to me twice. And I refused to help her. What are you saying? Did you two...? I know. I broke my own rules. No lecture. Just punch me in the face, then. Hatch, it's over. Unh-unh. Not for me. Let me take you home, partner. What the hell's going on? I had to do it. I had to make it look likeI was dead. Why? Why were you with Napoli? No. No, I wasn't withNapoli. He was in my carwhen I got in it. He forced me to driveto the river. Get out. Come on. Get out. - Don't hurt me. - Get out. Over there. Come on. Move, move, move, move. - Ah! Don't push me! - Come on, move. - I can't walk in this. - Just move. Damn it! What? What? My shoe just broke. Well, take it off. Hurry up. Hurry up! I fought him off and got away. I hid in the bushes till I could figure out a plan. Why didn't you just run? I was freaking out, okay? He had a gunand the keys to my car. I figured the busheswere the safest place. He didn't come looking for you? He did. Then after a while, he--he just gave up. Yeah. It's done. No, she's fish food. Okay. Okay, hurry. Yeah. About 10 minutes later, a car pulled up. Where's my money? Wait, wait, wait! I saw Savich kill Napoli. That's when I knew I had to do something. So I torea part of my dress, and I put it under the bridgeto make it look like I jumped. Well, aren't yougonna say something? Yeah? They just pulled a body from the river. Looks like it's Elise Laird. I'll meet you at the morgue. Okay. Do you hate me? You don't want to know the answer to that. Oh, jeez. Body's bloated. Been in the water for a while. Fish have been biting, so there's not much of a face. She is a blonde, and the dress we found matches the one that Mrs. Laird was wearing. - You hungry, darling? - No, thanks. Your Honor. You ready? That's her. That's... Elise. I'm gonna need, uh, dental records, of course, something to match the DNA with. All right. Now she can rest in peace. I'm gonna take a couple days off just to process everything, okay? Uh-huh.I'll keep working the case. Why? It's over. I want to know whyshe was involved with Savich, why she jumped. You gonna tell me where you're going? Nope.Thanks for everything, though. This wasmy grandmother's place. No onewill find us here. You ever gonna take these off? Why'd you become a cop? To do good, right? Something like that. You still don't believe me, do you? Well, you answer my questions,I'll answer yours. Go take a shower.You stink. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for coming. The body of Elise Laird has been found and positively identified. Judge Laird would like to say a few words. I want to, uh... express my gratitude to the police department, the, uh, search teams, the volunteers... I'm sorry. ...uh, everyone involved in this effort. My wife was a-- was a wonderful woman, and her life was tragically cut short. Please turn that thing off. Obviously, we all wish that the outcome-- Why would Cato Lairdwant to kill you? Cato and Savich are partners. Have been for years. That doesn't answermy question. Cato is on Savich's payroll, to get his boys off in court, but not all of them. That would look bad, right? So once in a while, a sacrificial lamb has to get sent off to prison. And then the lamb has to die there so he doesn't talk. What's thatgot to do with you? My brother Chet Rollins was one of those lambs. He worked for Savich. Knew way too much. In prison, he was raped in the shower, a bar of soap put down his throat. Dead. Well, sorry to hear that, but let's try it again. Why does Cato Lairdwant you dead? Before Chet went to prison, he sent me a letter through our mom, so it couldn't be traced back to me. He told me everything about Cato and Savich. Why didn't youjust go to the cops? A judge was crooked. I figured the police were, as well. So I decided to avenge his murder on my own. I went to work at the strip club, only as a waitress. It was financed by Savich. I hated the place, but I had to gain Savich 's trust. Yeah, by having sex with him? No. How did yougainhis trust? I saw the club's manager pocketing money. I told Savich. I became the bookkeeper, and I made sure that club turned a profit. With Savich, it's all about the money. What's it all aboutwith you? Revenge. Now, I needed proof of Savich's dealings with Cato, so I decided to go after the judge. I got a job at the country club. I despised every moment with that man. I made sure he didn't get me pregnant. And I 'd pretend to have insomnia so I can search the house for proof of his dealings with Savich. But after a year, I've come up with nothing. Cato became suspicious. That's why he had me followed. That's why he wants me dead. Now do you believe me? I believe you, Elise. That's the first time you called me by my name. Hey. Got us some food and got you some clothes, some... women's things. Women's things? Well, I can seewhy you're still single. Oh. Hey. Hey. It's me. How are you? - So-so. - You gonna tell me where you are? - Nope. - All right, well, listen. I found something linking Elise Laird with Savich. She had a brother, Chet Rollins. He was one of Savich 's dope dealers. - You're good. - Yeah, I am. They had different fathers, different last names, so it was easy to miss at first. Yeah, what do you make of that? Like brother, like sister. Elise worked for Savich, and maybe their relationship went further. Yeah. Maybe you're right. Hey, can you check and see if any of the Savich boys' cases were presided over by Judge Laird? Why? What are you thinking? I got to go. I'll, uh, call you when I get back into town. Okay. Bye. Just leaving a message for Deedee. - You look nice. - Liar. Mmm. Is the food all right? Are you sure? Yeah. It's good. You know, if I had goneto the police straightawayafter Chet's letter, I neverwould have met you. Right. But you got to get cozy with Savich and jump into bed with Laird. I did what I had to do. I know what you did. With Laird. With me. Probably Savich, although you deny it. Oh. You can besuch an ass sometimes. Yeah, I know. That's what they tell me. At least I'm not a, uh... Whore? Go on. Say it."Whore." Or do you want meto spell it for you? I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. No. Yes.Yes, you did mean it. What, are you're jealousor something? Oh, look, don't go turning this into some love story. Don't flatter yourself. You've been in love. I can tell. What happened? She walked. It's tough beingwith a cop. Is this... is this something you're gonna regret? Never. You and me-- we're hunters, always searching for someone, something. You lied to me. You are playing again. Want to knowhow I found you? I called your mom. Told her you were in trouble, which you are. Said I wanted to help, which I did, but nowI'm not so sure. Detective Bowen, I know you're upset-- I don't talk to dead people. Will you talk to me? You've got a whole lotof explaining to do. Not only have you ruinedyour career for her, you've destroyedour partnership. Deedee, I'm sorry. It's too late.It's way too late. I mean, how can you sneak offwith this slut? Hey, Deedee, she's not a slut! - I should arrest her. - For what? Shut up.You're dead, remember? Look, you got every right to be angry, okay, but this is not about you, Deedee. It's not even about me. It's about what's right. She faked her own death! To save her life! Hey, if I'm gonna stop being a cop, I'm gonna make it right. 'Cause we got an eyewitness to Savich killing Napoli. - Who? - Me. Oh, like you'rea credible witness. 'Cause Judge Laird and Robert Savich-- they're a team. Excuse me? Now, I'm gonna tell you all about it, but I'm gonna get you a diet cola, you're gonna sit down, relax. I got a plan. Got to take the gloves off, bend some rules. Will you help me? You okay with all this? You trust me, don't you? Can I trust you? I'm scared. Not for me, for you. All right, you got my truck, so be careful. We can't have any Elise Laird sightings till this thing's over, okay? Okay. Detective Bowen... I really am sorryfor everything. Hey, just wait here. I'll change, and I 'll be right back. Why couldn't youhave told me? Why couldn'tyou have trusted me? Deedee, I trust you. Come on.I made a mistake. All right, Brenda bailed on me. I was empty. I met Elise, and I, uh... you know, I'm sorry. I checked all of Savich's boysthat went to trial. Laird was on every case. Only one in fourgot a conviction. Well, we're gonna convict that bastard-- Savich, too. What happensif this doesn't work? I'll take the fall. You won't be affected. I amaffected, damn it! Everything has changed. You want to back out? Shut up. Go get changed.Are we gonna do this or what? That's my girl. Hey, Judge.How you doing? As well as can be expected, I guess. Good. You broke into my car? That's right, Judge. Get in. Suppose I don't? Get in. Deserted.Menacing. Implied threat.Very effective. So, tell me, um, did you manage to screw my wife? Or did shejust leave you hanging? 'Cause you're notthe only one. You're not unique, Detective, and you're not half as toughas you pretend to be. Sorry, Judge. Sometimes I can't control him. What do you want? Hey, we know you're dirty, but I don't care. I want Savich. Okay. Good, 'cause tomorrow he's being arraigned for the murder of Napoli. What? I got a witness who saw him do it by the bridge. Is he serious? Yes. The eyewitness also saw Napoli murder your wife. Well, then, she di-- She didn't kill herself? It appears not. Savich shows up after Napoli does his dirty work. Savich shoots him. So tomorrow when that bastard comes to your courtroom, I want him held with no bond, right? No one else knows what we know about what happened to your wife. I want a conviction and a sentence that puts him away for life. 'Cause I got enough to put you away for life. Do we have a deal? Well... I guess ghosts doexist. What are you doing here? Hello, Robert.I'm here to save your ass. You don't seemall that shockedto see me alive. I don't deal in surprises. So, is your husband aware of your current condition? That I'm alive? No. So where have you been? With Hatcher. Delicious. How does it feel to have that man give up his soul for you? Mm. He wants youmore than he wants me. I'm flattered. And I'm here to offer youa way out. Are you prepared to deal? Hands up. Now. Oh. What, you think I'm wired? Now. What can I say? I'm suspicious by nature. Blame my mother. So how'd you do it? My death, the body. Oh, Robert Savich always delivers. You know that. I saw you kill Napoli. Ouch. And based on my testimony, Hatcher will arrest you. He's with Cato right now, preparing to put you awayfor life. By coming here, you're betraying your new boyfriend. Why? We have different goals. He wants you.I want Cato Laird. I'm listening. If I testifyto what I saw, you will be convictedof murder. But if I recant, say I shotNapoli in self-defense, well, then Hatcher's gotnothing on you. A generous offer. But if you recant, you'll incriminate yourself. Oh, please. You think he'll send me offto prison? That man has fallenfor me hard. I've made sure of it. So what do you have planned for Cato Laird? I want him destroyed. Out of commission. We have a deal? Put the gun away, Robert. I know who you really are, Elise. Chet's sister. Cato and I knew all along. Why didn't youkill me then? Well, you were useful for me to keep tabs on my partner. I don't trust anyone, including you. I'm the bookkeeper. I record every transaction. Cato works for me, not the other way around. Bye-bye, Elise. You're about to be dead again. Hey! Cover her. I called for backup. Backup? I don't want backup! Freeze! Hatch-- Shut up! Check her purse. She's probably got a gun. Yeah. Gun. You know what I want? Right now, a confession. Hatch, don't do this. Wait for backup. Deedee, get out of here.Take her with you. I don't want youto see this. It's between me and Savich.Right? I want a confession. Right now. Chet Rollins, Napoli, all of them. Give it to me. Hatch, you're losing it! Don't do this. You'll lose everything. Say hello to Freddy Morris. Drop the gun, Hatch! Put the gun down now, you idiot! - Hatch, please, don't. - Shut up! I'm gonna kill you, or I'm gonna die doing it. Confess. I'm gonna kill you! Confess! Okay! Okay! I did Freddy, Napoli. I ordered the hit on Chetand on Gordon. Hatch, you good? Worley, this jackassneeds an ambulance. That was quite the performance, you two. Yeah, I'd say the samefor you guys. What? This was all an act? I had to make you believe I was on edge, right? So you were wired? No, actually, I wasn't. You know, it's not very high-tech, but it still does the job. Come on. Come on. You know you want to. Just do it. It's the only way we're ever gonna get back to normal. Orangeisn't his color. Sure looks pretty on him. All right, nine-letter wordfor "confound"? Obfuscate. That's good. All rise. Be seated. Your Honor? Yes, Mr. Adams? Before we begin, may I request that we remove these restraintsfrom my client? Denied. This is a bond hearing on a murder charge. Ms. Nelson? Your Honor, due to the seriousness of the charges against the defendant, and with his extreme flight risk, we respectfully request that bail be denied. Elise? Cato Laird, you're under arrest for conspiracy to murder Chet Rollins. Deputy, remove this man from this courtroom immediately! - Stand down, deputy. - This is my courtroom! What is this? You're under arrest, Judge. You killed my brother. He was gonna expose you and Savich. Captain, this woman is delusional. She killed a man in our home! Oh, for years, Cato, you've been takingmoney from Savich in exchangefor favorable rulings. Who is gonna believe this woman? She's unhinged and unstable! She's totally insane! Save your breath. We have Savich's computer with all your transactions. All the payoffs, the secret bank account in the Cayman Islands-- we got it all. You set me up? You can thank your wife for this, and her boyfriend Hatcher. You are doing her. Now, that's damn hard to believe. What a shocker, huh, sweetheart? It's time to pay for your sins, Cato. You two deserve each other. Cato Laird, you havethe right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you-- Gun! It's clear. My parents invited usto Sunday dinner. That's the third invitationin three months. They're driving me nuts, okay? Come on. Your father's a Baptist minister. I'm like his worst nightmare. Look, my dad is notin the condemning business. He's in the forgiving business.But what's to forgive? Nothing. Not you. - Hey. - Yeah. Babe Ruth. 1933. Mint condition. Welcome back. We got to go downtown. They found a dead body in a sewer. That's what the captain gives us? A body in the sewer on our first day back? This job stinks. That was sonot funny. - You smiled. - No, I didn't. - Yeah, you did. - Hatch, I'm driving. Just give me the keys. I'm driving. Deal with it. It's good to be back.
