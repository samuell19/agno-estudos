A Nikkatsu Presentation - Thank you for attending. - You too. We appreciate it. Thank you. - Thank you for attending. - Thank you for attending. My condolences. - Is the car ready? - Yes. - Then go ahead. - Okay. I'll go first. What are you doing? Goro! You must be drunk! I am not going to let that bastard Saeji take over! Wait, Goro! I'm fine with you taking over the clan because I'm planning on leaving the house. Ma'am, stop pretending. Don't think you can fool me with that! You are the clan's daughter. Since I'm taking over the Nanbara clan, you have to become my wife! No! Let me go! You can't say no! We will get married when the new day dawns. No! No! No! No! No! Stop it! ROPE HELL (Based on Oniroku Dan's Novel Yakuza Angel) Producer: Yoshihiro Yuki Based on the Novel by Oniroku Dan Screenplay: Kyohei Konno & Koyu Ohara Director of Photography: Hidenobu Nimura Lighting: Hideyuki Kobayashi Art Director: Natsuo Kawafune Editor: Jun Nabeshima Music: Taichi Yamanashi Assistant Director: Takashi Kanno We are not strangers anymore. You are my wife. I won't give you to anyone else. Starring: Naomi Tani, Nami Aoki Hitoshi Takagi, Hirokazu Inoue, Kenji Fuji Kitsuda Yoshie Directed by Koyu Ohara - Sis! Ma'am! - What is happening? Who are you? What is this stupidity? Hey... You are not supposed to display this disgraceful behavior on this important day. Please stop! Mr. Izawa! Goro! You are pathetic! Considering your history so far, you've misbehaved publicly. You have to go through the proper procedure. That's disappointing. I thought you would marry the girl and take over Nanbara. Nobody knows how things will turn out. Who'd have thought that the bastard Saeji would come back to the clan? Stop getting so worked up. I will take care of you. Sorry, Hanamura. Listen, make money before accepting a man. That's my philosophy. Becoming a boss is just a matter of time. Even having a girl like Akiko is possible. - Hanamura. - Wait! Could you stop calling me Hanamura ? From now on, call me President in here. I got it, President. Glad to be with you. You are well established as a loan company even without any collateral. Don't be ridiculous. The girls' bodies are our collateral. That's why we lend money according to our evaluation of the girl's face. We don't even lend a penny to the ugly ones. We don't have to worry about girls' money problems. They work hard in brothels and bars and pay the principal back in no time. What do you think? It's an interesting job, isn't it? Having fun and earning money! That's my motto. Hey, everyone! He is one of us now. He must be the eldest here. Please treat him as a senior employee. Yes. Hey! Tamae! Takada! Aoki! Can you take care of this? Sorry for the wait. Welcome. Great place, isn't it? What are you doing? Payment is already overdue. This is not your property anymore. We have customers right now. Can you give me a chance today, at least? Ma'am... We are a loan company lending money without any collateral. Thank you. When are you going to pay us? I've already paid back the 5,000,000 I borrowed... Don't make me laugh. You must know that you can't borrow money without paying interest in this world. Of course, I'm aware of that. But... Mother! Not now. Go upstairs. They're here. Excuse me. Could you give us a moment? Sorry. I won't take too much of your time. Just follow us. Let's go, Miss. Let's go. What is going on? Those are not good manners! Haven't you heard anything from your mother? 5,000,000 plus 10% interest. Also, it is based on compound rate. There is a penalty for late payments. This adds up to 12,000,000 in total. Please review the statement. Sorry for the wait. Since your mother has no intention to pay, we brought you here. This voice... Can you hear it? What do you want me to do? Do you recognize it? I think you don't understand what is going on with you right now. I will do anything I can do. What should I do? First, as a portion of the interest, I want you to take off the clothes you are wearing. Huh? Miss, take off all your clothes. That's ridiculous! - These clothes are... - Stop! Stop it please! They are worthless! Take them off! Crazy! You are crazy! Miss! Where are you going? Let me go! Please let me go! Let me... Hey, hey... She is going to deposit herself into the collateral safe. Give them back! No! No! Stop it! No! No! No! Stop! Stop this! No! No! No! No! No! Help! Help me! Somebody help! Help! Please help me! No! Help! No! No! No! No! If you listen to us, you don't have to stay like this. Okay... No! No! No! Stop! No! No... Stop! Don't do this! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Time to change. No! You don't seem to know men's true nature. Stop! Please stop! I want you to do something for me. Finance / Tokyo Telephone Inc.

I guess it is hard to forget. Is it hatred? Or does the pinky still hurt? You know what? I'm going to show you something to cheer you up. President, she has a weird trait for having such a cute face. I think the correct word is masochist. She says that she likes being tied up like this. She even said that if she had to do this, she'd want you to do it in her favorite pose. Oh, really? She said that she is definitely a virgin and that she wants you to check. How cute. Bring her now. Lick my cock with your tongue! Clean my cock! No! No! No! No! No! No! What? Are you saying that you know the girl? She's the daughter of Izawa, the current leader of the Nanbara clan and the man who cut off my finger. Izawa? Didn't his wife pass away years ago? She must be the kid that his second wife brought into the marriage. Does that mean Kinuyo is Izawa's wife? That's interesting! Time flies. It's already been a month since the boss died. Miss... Could you consider it one more time? Mr. Izawa, the matter is already... Weren't you going to marry Saeji and take over the clan? Father used to say... "The age of yakuza is over. Yakuza are incapable of doing clever business." I feel extremely sad when I think about the disappearance of the Nanbara clan's three-generation-long reputation. Is this just because I'm too old? Mr. Izawa... As I said, it's better for me to leave the house. I know very well how rebellious that behavior seems, but please let me do it. As a way to show my gratitude, I will give you all the Nanbara clan's rights and properties. Could you take care of yourself and the underlings with these resources? I will give my best to do the job! I've gathered all the funds in the hope of enabling the clan to start a new kind of business. I see. I will take care of everyone but I'm against disbanding the clan. This is yours. I can't accept it. What? Kinuyo has appeared at the loan company? Thank you for the information. We will take the bill shortly. Thank you. Thank you. I'm paying the money. Please give Machiko back to me. Where is Machiko? This much won't resolve anything after all that. - Huh? - Miss... It looks like you think that our interest rate is very favorable. Hey! Show her the statement! Yes. Here. 2,000,000 still remain? The amount I borrowed was 5,000,000. We will keep your daughter until you pay the full amount. No way! No way! You can't take my daughter as collateral! She is such a good girl. She said that she'd do anything if she could save her mother. I think you borrowed this money from the wrong place. Tajima Finance has a bad reputation. They already owe me a lot of money. It's not very different than borrowing from us again. Ma'am, nice to see you again. Goro! I've been working for him since I left the clan. What a bad occasion to see you again. No... Just... Goro! Do you know her? Yes, I know her. Please, don't say it! I see it clearly now... That makes things simple then. Let me call and ask them. I will do anything! Please keep this secret from Izawa! This is not his business! I started this myself without telling him. Please! Did you sleep well? Give me back my clothes. I should be free now. The promise has been kept. - No! - Why? You disobeyed the President. No way... I don't understand... You didn't clean your juices off his cock that last time. No way... No way... That's cruel... At least you know what you did wrong now. You will do whatever the President asks from now on. We won't decrease the value of a good product. Okay, let's eat. Eat it all up. Here. Another one. Here. And some water... Are you saying that she hasn't pissed since last night? Painful, isn't it? That must be very painful! Let me help you. You still don't understand. If you disobey the President, you will get punished! Hey! Hey! Shhh... Shhh... Shhh... Shhh... Everything is fine. Do it. Shhh... You've smeared the President's pants. You just don't pay close attention to the instructions. The promise has been revoked because of that. Mr. Izawa! Long time no see... Oh! Goro, isn't it? Actually, I have something to talk to you about. Could you give me a few moments of your time? So, what do you want to talk about? This is a photo I took at a loan company. Would you like to see it? I think Kinuyo borrowed money from a disreputable loan company. Wait? Didn't you know? You are such a tenacious guy. Showing Akiko to Mr. Izawa? Very good, President. Provoking Izawa and hitting the weak Nanbara clan... If things go well, I will give you half of the territory. Mr. Izawa... I'm ashamed! The late boss asked me to take care of you, but I've made a huge mistake. Why didn't you tell me? Forgive me! It was out of an impulse! I wasn't acting rationally! My judgment was bad! Wait! This is a challenge for the Nanbara clan from Hanamura. Leave it to me. This is the clan's business. Miss! I've been thinking I could have a separate life with Saeji after leaving the clan matters to you... But it is different now. I will face Hanamura in person and resolve this matter. Ma'am! At least, wait for Saeji to come back... I'm the successor of Junpei Nanbara. I won't forgive your cruel behavior but Ms. Machiko's wellbeing is my priority. I'm paying you back. Please return Ms. Machiko! Ms. Nanbara... This amount won't do anything considering the interest rate. Mr. Hanamura... We are in Nanbara territory. This is not a game. Could you stop your greediness now? Greed? We are running a proper business here! Do you want to see the statement? Keeping an innocent girl as collateral is running a proper business? - That's cruel! - Ma'am! It's been a while. Goro... You must be the one behind all this! Do you want to see? Machiko! Machiko! I won't leave until you give her back to me. I will pay any price. I will take her back no matter what. I can see you have the qualities of a successor of the Nanbara clan. That makes things simple. I've once dreamed of me being a great gambler like your late father. Business aside, would you settle this matter via a gamble? I bet the total amount of the contract and Machiko Izawa's life. I want you to bet Nanbara's business rights and territories. Please. These are getting in. Okay? They are in. Please participate. It's done. Game start! You must have made up your mind. Please wait. Where are you going after losing all your territories and business rights? How about another game? I'll bet all of the Nanbara clan's possessions I've just taken, the contract and Machiko's life. But I have nothing. No, you do. Yourself. Alright! Do it, then. No! Since I won the game, we can do anything. Hey, have fun! Come here! - Hello! - Long time, no see. Starting today, Hanamura Finance will run the entire Nanbara clan's territory. We took the lady too. - Really? - Yes. Follow me. If you are interested, I will speak highly of you to the President. What do you think? Okay, show me your loyalty. Could you shave the pubic hair of the madam of your former clan? If you can't do this, I won't be able to trust you. Hey! Ma'am! Please forgive us! Hey! Fetch Machiko! Show them what will happen if they disobey me! Hurry! She used to work at a brothel in Kyushu. She is a woman with class. Goro! Would you do it? Ma'am, I'm going to demonstrate my good manners. Look at this finger, please! The finger you destroyed! Lick it! Lick it! Apologize, ma'am. Who... Who would apologize to a person like you? Forgive me. It's my family's fault. I got the lady involved. Brother! Excuse me! - What's up? - Goro has sent something. This is the lady's... Bastard... I can't take it anymore. Brother! I have been attracted to you since Nanbara picked me up when I was a kid. Since Saeji has come back... Shit! It's all your body's fault! I didn't want to give this to Saeji, no matter what! Hey! Hanamura! Show yourself! Hey! Show yourself! Hey! Saeji! Trying to fight us all alone? You have guts, but nowadays hotheads like you are destined to lose! Goro! You are the one who betrayed the Nanbara clan? Finish it! Finish it! There's nothing else you can do right now. I don't care what will happen to me. Please set her free as compensation for what you do to me. Well said. You're a chivalrous man, aren't you? Akiko is already mine. Stop! Stop it! Goro! You must be angry about me destroying your finger! So destroy mine as compensation! And please... I don't need your finger. What I'm going to destroy is this! Saeji! You, born of a different mother, will never understand how much I've hated this. There should be no end to your suffering. I can't just make you fall into a coma right now. We're celebrating the downfall of the Nanbara clan! Drink up! Even the leading members are spoiled. Nanbara clan... It's like going back to the past. Hey! Come on! As I told you earlier, you have to greet the President. Akiko Nanbara, the successor of the Nanbara clan, has become a slave of Hanamura Company. Whatever I have to do to make up for my previous mistakes from now on, I will not bear a grudge. Huh? I can't hear you. Speak up so I can hear you. Whatever I have to do to make up for my previous mistakes from now on, I will not bear a grudge. Whatever, you said? Yes. Let's enjoy this with everyone. Stop it! Please! Forgive me! Beg me to give you an enema if you want to save Saeji! Please! Please give me an enema! Stay like this for 5 minutes. 3 more minutes. 2 more minutes. I can't live on after this disgrace. Akiko! Let's die together! Please die with me! THE END
