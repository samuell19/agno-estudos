THE PAPER MAN - Stop him! - Stop him! - Stop him! - My wallet! He stole my wallet! Stop him! - Stop him! - Stop! Stop! - Stop! - My wallet! My wallet! My wallet! Stop him! He stole my wallet! Stop him! Wait! - My money! - Wait! Here's your money. Where's my 10 grand bill? My 10 grand bill is missing! Ten grand! Didn't you mean a million? I'm telling you, I had a 10 grand bill in my wallet. Yes, in my wallet! Behind Saint Christopher... ... who protects the travelers. My wallet! Where is it? Over there. Everything costs 5 cents more. Really, everything's more expensive. When have I stolen a cent from you? Look at me. - What's wrong with him? - He can tell by the eyes... ...when they want to cheat him. He's mute, but not stupid. Coffee? Fourteen. Seventeen. Twenty-two. Eight. Come on! You'll have to tell me if a car is coming, man! Mute man. Get yourself someone to feed you. My daughter and I are leaving tomorrow. I've found that forgetful father-to-be. Pay me. I've charged for it already. You'll thank me when the baby's cry... ...reminds your mason of the souvenir he left you. I'll do what you want me to, won't I? Why talking about my business? Soon there will be so many journeys... ... to the moon and back... ...that a space traffic station... ...will be required. Come on! Lmagine the cops on their clouds! A cloud for each one of them. Come on! - Pay attention! - Go on! Read! Because when the atoms become disintegrated... ...they generate the energy unchaining the reaction... ...that, when integrated in the form or heat... ...and of... ...and of... - Of what? - Yes, what? Well, the rocket flies really really fast... ...because of that atom thing, right? And of course, because of the jet reaction. Oh! The reading is free, but the newspaper isn't. Pay me. Pay me. What do I care about space journeys! I won't go to the Moon! But what about the news about that old decree? - Which one? - The President's decree. He gave us this community's electricity for free. Have you forgotten, Mite? Tell me... ...how much have you saved in candles and oil? That's right. Who wrote the list the Government asked for... ...for you? - What list? The list of people who are going to get... ...those 3,000 new houses. If it wasn't for me you wouldn't be getting... ...a house at all. - Pay him! - Okay! Okay! But I'm paying him just because of the house. Cut that nonsense! Pedro, it's bedtime. I made a hole in it like you said and it's not working. Try it now. You're so clever, Dad! Hey! It's just a "beep", not a "tra-la-la-la". Hey, the mute man is more clever than you! You meddler! Oh, Bartolini, how sad is life! What a sad life, Bartolonini! Oh, Bartolonete, how sad life is! I don't want to sing anymore. Why not? He's trying to compete with us. Don't say that. This man's a friend. A friendly thief. Titino, don't be rude. He is a beautiful person. Beautiful? He isn't. He looks like a kangaroo with a hat. Hey, what museum did you escape from? Answer me! Oh, you're mute! What's your name? "Mr. Nape"? Oh, "Mr. Apple"! Adam. His name is Adam. Just like our father Adam. No, my father's name is Chencho. Oh, my batteries are low. Ladies and gentlemen, if you could spare some change... ...for Titino to keep on singing... ...we'd really appreciate it. Children... ...l've got to wind Titino. That's enough for five cents. My throat is dry. Hang in there. No. Drink some tequila. Well, just to get my voice clear, okay? Excuse me. Go ahead. Another sip. No, no, I'll get drunk. One more sip or I won't sing. Okay, okay. You make such a big sacrifice for me, right? Hey! Poor kid, he's lost. Hand him to the cops. - I'm in a hurry. - Wait, wait! Wait here, don't move. I'll be right back. Eighteen. Where did that little garbage come from? Your son? Oh, that was a secret well kept! But he can't deny being your son. He's just like his father. What's that? What do you mean yours? What? We'll hand him to the police right now. You're so stupid! They'll say you're a kidnapper! Oh, he's sucking you up already, man! What about his parents? The boy's parents, don't play dumb. What about the kid's parents? What? Too bad for them, right? Lmagine how worried they must be. Look at me, I'm talking to you! Am I right or not? There, we're handing him in. That's enough, man! Besides, we're here already. Come on. Really? We'll do as I say! Leave that kid alone or I'll say you stole him. It's for your own good, man. So you won't have 20 years of a life sentence. Give him to me. Come on, son! Give me a hand, don't just stand there! You'd be the perfect son-in-law for me... ...but you make too little money. No, at the 3,000 houses you'd be too far from the city... ...and you're a city man. All those people get their jobs done within 2 hours... ...without leaving, right? But you'd rather walk all over Mexico... ...even though the pay is less. Why? That's why! You're a man who likes to walk the streets... ...among the cars. Because you're a civilized man. Pay me. Don't start it! What? I don't like working for someone else to get paid. Look, Mite, this is the last time I tell you... ...that I do the thinking for you. I represent you at the union... ...I teach you and let you know... ...what's going on in the world. You'll try to impress us with your... ...megaphone radio. - Megaton! Fellows, tell this scavenger what will happen... ...when one of those bombs hit us. Tell him! - We'll die. - Of course! - It's active radio. - It's the other way round! - Pay him now. - Come on, pay him. Here. I'm just doing it for the bomb. You pig! Mute man, mute man... Mute man... Give me a lollipop. Thanks. Here comes Torcuato! I felt sorry for him. He's impaired and no one pays attention to him. But the fact that his dog died doesn't mean... ...he can keep someone else's child. So now I'm pretending to be mad at him. Get that garbage off my truck! Okay! I forgive you. What? Do I have to forgive you and smile? It's okay, then. But if you want to be a father... ...you'll have to get a mother. Get the ladies to like you. What about the hands? Don't you know how to caress? Make up your mind or you'll have to get a son... ...out of the orphanage. Mute man. Bye, mute man. And you're not a pig, okay? Maria, leave that "pig" the way it was... ...and remember your forgetful man. Have you chosen yours already? Your house, man. Aren't they saying... ...every scavenger will get one? If I had known that I wouldn't have changed... ...my sack for these wheels. Here we are! There's a reason why they call him "forgetful". You're pretending not to know us, aren't you? - What do you want? - I want you to take... ...responsibility for your woman... ...what's inside of her. Those are my wife and children. What about my daughter? If you don't make a fuss, I'll give her some money. What about me? I haven't done anything to you. I mean, you'll give her money... ...what about me? - I don't care. Do you expect me to support you? I'd say so. Go to Hell! What did I raise my children for? Once you're old, they're useless. Forget it, then. - Can you give me a ride? - Where? - Anywhere you're going. - Get in. Where are you going? Don't get humiliated. You need to harden your heart. I'll give you some advice. That man is like tourists: Just stares... ...but never buys. He hasn't sinned already. Come in, daddy, will you? What? Go ahead, reverend. Go ahead. Oh, man! Cigarette? I don't smoke. But I'll give it to you. I have an stereophonic up there. I'm in mourning. I'll play you a sad long play, okay? I'm in mourning. We'll turn off the light. Pitch black. What do you say? My wallet is in mourning, too. But if you'll take credit, well... You'll have my condolences. Dead. Mr. Fernandez. Shall we? Let's go. I'm in great need, you know? Listen to my advice... ... women you must give... ... bread and jam and... ... a little bit of love. You always have to give them, give them... ... bread and jam and a bit of love. What's with you? Watching is enough for you? You sit right there every day. You'll make a hole on that boardwalk. What the heck, labor of love. Come on, you'll pay whatever you can. No? You're not Marlon Brando, you know? You bastard! You sissy! So you mean you want me... ...for your use only. - Right. You're way too classy to be here. And you think I can't work at fancy houses? But the competition is tough there. But here... In the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed... Not that one-eyed! I'm not worthless. Of course not. That's why I want you for me. I'll take the exclusive... with a bank account, okay? Don't get too anxious. Then I'm like a bus: Yours only... ...while on the journey. In that case, I'd rather take a taxi. Mr. Fernandez, when you grow tired of Dolce Vita... ...here's your long gone. I'd say it's "Gone With the Wind". You joker! That rude, stupid man! You're lucky, you still get to pick. What do you mean, "still"? It won't last forever. That moron wouldn't take me for free. Keep on looking for another job. I've been to too many offices. They ask you to know how to write... ...spelling and I don't know what. - You can answer a phone. - Not even that! You have to go well-dressed. And I have nothing but this. Excuse me, can you tell me where the Cathedral is? - I'll take you, baby. - Okay. You'll hear the bells ringing very loud! Bells? Bells from my hometown? So you didn't like my friend. Cat's got your tongue? Oh, you're mute! Are you looking for romance? Who with? But the music that I play... ...is hi-fi. Too expensive for you. A blue one. A blue one, man. A 50 pesos bill. I bet you've never seen one. Inocencia. What are you doing here? I'm not trying to compete with you! I'm here to tell your co-worker... ...she'll have to pay punctually... ...or I won't look after her girl anymore. You're so cute, baby! We'll pay you tomorrow! Wait, I'll show you something. And get the girl ready to take her to the zoo! Come on, sultan, wait for your Shahrzad! What are you staring at? Well, I'll look for a place to set the table. Yes. Look, how beautiful! Good. That's it. Great! You can play astronaut. Go on. Here they come. Damn it! Hey! How dare you... ...carry the girl? Don't you see... ...you're a nest of microbes? Come here, baby. I hope she didn't catch... ...anything from him. - Take it easy. Maybe she'll even get mute and stupid. Too bad you can't talk back, right, silent boy? Come on, get a beer and you won't feel that bad. Take it. Come on, girl! Come here! Come on, take it! Don't move. Little girl. How rude! He didn't mean to offend. I know. But if we don't get respect... ...on our day off, then when? Well said. Look! Now there really is no way I can hate him. Hey, mute man, you can play with my daughter. Come here. Come here. Have something to eat. Here you go. Thanks. Thanks. Six years. - Is that you? - Yep. You had already started working, right? Right. It was going to be just for a week, to make ends meet. And I did. Oh, yes! But then again I had to make ends meet. That's when it turned ugly. - You managed again. - Right. Every week it was: "Just one more". You made ends meet so well that you meet more than that. And I have more debts than ever. What can I say? I never saved my money. - Men. - Right. Men are meant to make money and women to take it. But it was the opposite with you. Lack of men crisis. Too many women. You tell me, I ran away from my competitors in Europe. - And it's the same here. - Right. Tough luck, girl. Was this picture really taken 6 years ago? Right. I need to sin faster. From now on, anyone with 50 pesos... ...will be my king. Moving services. Just a second. - Torcuato! - What's up? The mute man on the phone. Tell him I won't pick him up today. Tell him about Monterrey. Torcuato got a job and he'll be out of town... ...for a few days, so don't wait for him. You're welcome, mute man. Six, seven... ... eight and thirty cents. Yes, I think you have fifty already. Wait, Adam. No. You have 6 pesos and 50 cents left. Two, three, four... ...five, six and fifty. Mute man! She's not here. But if you want to scare her... ...look for her at the cabaret tonight. You haven't listened. Are you really going to demolish these houses? You must leave this hovel within 2 weeks. Last notice. Yes, Daddy. Move it, move it. What's with him? He says the government wants to demolish our shop. So? Will you take me dancing? It depends. Wait, man! That's for the movies. Okay. Okay, what? Are you coming in? - I'd rather wait here. - You're such a sissy! What's up, man! Came here to dance? Hey! You finally saved it, right? Wait. - Your king's here. - What king? The one you said. He's got 50 pesos. I wouldn't even go to a masquerade with him! You'll see, he won't be feeling romantic in no time. Come on, Margarito. My friend says you're loaded. With dirt, right? Great! But you'll buy a drink for us first. Bones! Another round for that table. Get over there. We'll be right with you. Bravo! Bravo! I'll help you. 51... ...52... - The rest is for you, Bones. - Thank you. Where were you going to take me? I wanted to go to a bullfight. Yes, yes, yes. But who hit first? You can leave. It's a 50 pesos fine or a week in jail. Hey, maybe two weeks, huh? Haven't you got any family or friends... ...to come and pay for you? Yes, sure. You can use the tele... ...phone. Moving services. Torcuato isn't back yet, mute man. You're welcome. We shouldn't be locking you up here. But the nut house is not my jurisdiction. Just look what's become of us. We used to work on the TV. And it's your fault that we got fired. Not mine. Your destiny is to blame. One of these days they'll find you dead... ...at a bar. Have you seen who's here? No. Who? My friend Adam. I can't see him. He's hidden behind that fat man. Adam, my friend. Come and say hi to Titino. Kids, tell him to come. Yes! Can I kiss his cheek? Kiss him, but keep on working. I gave you a kiss. Now give me a bill. Come on! You've given me a bill, now give me a kiss. Come on! Titino, what should you say? Give me another peso. One zero more and it's a hundred. Ten more just like that one. You're no longer interested in fifties. One zero more makes a thousand. A thousand is ten 100 bills. I'll explain it easier. A thousand it ten 100 bills or a hundred 10 bills. Is that clear? Never mind, you'll never get a thousand pesos... ...in your whole life. Well, one more zero is ten times... ...what you haven't been able to understand. You do understand that, don't you? Well, math class is over. Dear God! The bank is closed today. What if we break it tomorrow? Come back early tomorrow. Don't you think it's safer in there? Someone may steal it, boy. Don't you trust me? Haven't I proven my honesty to you? Didn't I give you six pesos back the other day? So ungrateful. At least you think as a child. Here. Take good care of it. Don't lose it! Money changes people. But I forgive you. I'll wait for you early tomorrow. God bless you, child. See you tomorrow. I'll see you early tomorrow. Man! I think I need a pair of glasses, right? But don't you think I'm angry. I'm not angry! I'll see you here, okay? I'll be waiting. What? What is it? You want my husband to be back to ask him for money. He won't be back until tomorrow night. What? Sleep over? Forget it! If you're cold, go and get your fleas warm over there... ...at the brick ovens. I'll trade my dog for yours. No way! I wanted a white dog. Morning... What's up, girls? Hurry up. Come on, or we won't make it to the sermon, hurry. I'm coming! You again? If you've got another 50, buy some soap... ...and take a bath. Son of a! Son! Are there 10,000 pesos bills, too? Come in! Take a seat. Wait a minute. I won't ask you who you killed. What will you do with it? For me? Why me? First I have to give you a bambino. You want a clean dad for your son, don't you? Well, I'll give you a present. Go get a shower. Don't you want to be a dad? I was just putting these things away. Do you think I was stealing it, you moron? Don't you want to make a bambino? The son you wanted, huh? You don't want it anymore? You won't be able to break it. They'll think you stole it. You'll see. You moron! Lmbecile! You thief! You mute! What are you afraid of? What is it? What are you hiding? What is it, Adam? Trust me. I'm your friend, right? I mean, Adam. I mean... Let me see. He's acting very strangely. Don't make a noise. You go over there. What are we doing? Man! That hurt! Mute and now, insane. Tonight, while he's asleep... Beat him? Just like that? It's not a theft. He has something that belongs to all of us. Otherwise, why would he hide it? Sure, he must give us a piece each. I want in, I want in! But, a piece of what? A piece of what? Who knows what it may be? But he must give us all a piece of it. Too bad, you'll have to earn that money... ...honestly. What will you tell him when he wakes up? I know. We're so stupid. Do you know where we didn't look? Nothing like a nice shower to sleep wonderfully. You really slept like a log yesterday. Yes, you were very sleepy. Look, you didn't even finish your coffee. No, no. It's cold already. Did you want to ask me something? No, not like that. Look, like this. Twist is very simple. As if you had taken a bath and were drying yourself. Like this! What's wrong? We'll it's getting late. I'll get ready. My zipper. First I'll take you for breakfast. Then we'll get you some clothes, because... ...you can't go to the bank like that. But before that... ...we have to go to where you hid the bill. Because you don't have it with you, do you? Take your stuff out, we're closing this down. But... ...you are trespassing! Trespassing, my foot! We gave you a fair notice. Come on! So no one can remove those seals. Only if you get an order. Then get it, otherwise a man who's still in there... ...will die. - How funny! - The government is funny! Where are we going to work now? Get a decent job. Listen to him, a decent job, he says. No wonder Cervantes said: "You foolish men who accuse women without good reason... ...you are the cause of what you blame." "You break down their resistance and toss them away." Come on, Doggy! This way. Stop crying, my friend. Here, take my stuff where your daughter is... ...and wait for me. Let's go. Perfect. Perfect, great. Very handsome. Rubirosa is nothing. That's 85 very well spent pesos. Ninety-five. Eighty-five! Eighty-five. I've got change. You'll pay me back later. How much? A deposit? No, we want to break a ten. No, ten thousand. Give it to me, honey. I told you, you were wasting your time... ...l've already checked. But you haven't told us why. Are you turning it against me? I did it in order to keep... ...this community's good name. We don't know whether it was theft or forgery... ...we have to be ready in case the mute man comes back. That won't be possible. We are not rats, snitches nor betrayers. - Right? - Sure. There may be a reward. But we are also good citizens. - Right, fellows? - Sure. That's the spirit, boys. Today is the mute man... ...tomorrow will be this guy. What did he mean? Let's go. You're done with me, aren't you? No way, we're only getting started. Why? Am I not cooperating with the police? Didn't I bring you here myself to capture him? You're under arrest. So, if the bill is a fake, I'm a forger. - Lf it's good, I'm a thief. - You're an accessory. No way! You want me to get blown. You are blown, you haven't been able to explain... ...where that bill came from. - What would I ask him for? If he mugged someone and killed him... ...that's his own business, isn't it? Come on, let's go. What do you want? Oh, it's you. Dressed up like that I didn't recognize you. Torcuato, the mute man wants a word. It's kind of late to come and bug us. Come in, man. Jeez! Did you win the lottery? Ten thousand! Did you find them? Victoria, come here. Coming. It's a dream, man! A dream. I've got great plans for you. Do you want to be my partner? What? Our friend ran into ten thousand pesos! Come, Victoria, look! Jesus Christ! First thing, we'll buy a new truck. Truck, my foot! We'll pay the mortgage first to stop paying interests. And then the children... ...they... - Stay out of this, Victoria. Of course I'm in this! Oh, yes, sir! Now that we can we should pay... ...our debt on the TV. And the children... I said, shut up, Victoria! I'll pick you up tomorrow and we'll go brake it. You'll keep it? - Do you want to keep it? - Don't give it to him! Don't be stubborn, man, it's safer here. Don't give it to him! I won't give it to you, man! Go away, you mute man! I've always done what's best for you. All my life I've made sure you don't do anything stupid. Leave, now, you're making me angry. Jesus! I'll break it tomorrow and give it back to you. But not now. Beat it! Beat it, mute man, shoo, shoo! Oh, my God! Kill him! Asphyxiate him! Kill him! Dad! Oh, no! Stay out of this! Daddy! Oh, God! The mute man! Police! Police! The mute man! - Shut up! - You bastard! And you, beat it! Get out of here! Get out, you murderer! You scum! You evil! You bastard! Oh, no! Stop him! Don't let him run away! The mute man! Get up! Are you letting him go? Shut up! It's all your fault! I think I'll teach you a lesson. Mommy! Come in. Come in. What? You know how much that is, don't you? Do you want it in 1,000 bills, 500 bills... ...or 100 bills? Small bills. This is it, okay? Count it. It's okay, huh? Count it! Yours, they're yours. Take them. These may all be 1000 bills. And you'd still think yours is more money! You moron! Wait. Wait! Wait! I have another bunch of hundreds! You mute, son-of-a... ORPHANAGE Me first! Me! Look, I told you, he's upsetting... ...the children's stomach. I've been looking for you everywhere... ...and here you are, handing lollipops out. Come on, it's your turn, the headmaster's waiting. Come on, kids. To your groups. Thank you, headmaster. See you. - I appreciate it. - Good luck. They're so cute, aren't they? They're twins. Follow me. While our sign language teacher arrives... ...we can get through some requisites. I'll give you a form for you to fill in. What your job is, what your salary is... ...your wife's name, how long you've been married... ...and... oh, did you bring your marriage certificate? Well, you'll bring it later. Sit down and wait here, please. Pretty active toys, aren't they? It's okay, I'll calm them down. Come with me. Have a sit and fill in this form. Don't you have a pen? Here. You can't write? Did you send for me? This is our teacher. I don't know what he's saying, you talk to him. He doesn't understand me, but I do understand him. He must be within the 3% of cases you told me about. He cannot speak, but he can hear well. Tell the teacher what you wanted to tell me. You, you. What else? A little dog! I got that, what else? What a mean driver! You're alone. Sure, sure. Go on. Don't you have any friends? They want to rob you, that's why you have no friends. I understood that. Women. Women don't like you. What makes you think women don't like you? They hide from you. They get scared. Fear. Are you afraid women will make fun of you? Of course, because you're mute. A person like you is not capable... ...of taking care of a child. Money is not enough. Loving him a lot is not enough, either. A kid is a live and constant problem. You have to keep him healthy, raise him, educate him. What will become of a child living with you? Were you going to do all that with this money? Look... ...your bill is worth less... ...much less than what you imagine. It wouldn't be enough... ...to buy that little house you didn't want. Don't think that women despise you for being mute. Talk to them... ...well, your own way. You'll see you'll get a partner. This orphanage... ...cannot give you a child. Oh, how sad, how lonely life is! That's enough, kids. The show's over, good-bye. Mr. Adam is here to chat with Titino. Titino? No, Titino's not for sale, my friend Adam. I make my living out of him. Okay. Titino? No, my friend, what for? Titino can speak on its own. Look. Who's that? Titino... I'm unplugged. Mr. Adam is here to say hi. If I go out, my brain's transistors will leak. Titino's real value is the wonderful mechanism... ...he's got inside. I'm not lying, my friend Adam. Science has even created mechanic people... ...who can do everything. Really. You'll see, Titino's mechanism will solve... ...all your problems. Let me sleep. You see? He knows. You just have to let him sleep until tomorrow. Don't laugh, I'm serious. No, no, no, my friend Adam, this is serious. His mechanism must rest for 12 hours. Otherwise... ...it won't work, it'll get broken. Taking Titino out before that time is very dangerous. But... ...he's yours already, you can break it if you want to. Right? You'll wind Titino tomorrow and he'll talk all day long. But don't let him out today. Poor mute man! But he's to blame for having money. Besides, what would he want that money for? It will help you get back on your feet, won't it? Since you're my dad, you won't be alone anymore. Now I need a mom. Get yourself a girl. I'll do the talking. You just have to wind me... ... and we'll get her. I'm sorry, my dear Adam. I hid the talking mechanism, I sold you the casing. It's your fault for being stupid. One more zero is a thousand, and one more, you'll go crazy. That bill in your hands is but paper. I'm glad, God punishes greed, you mute bastard. You moron! You idiot! You criminal! You mute man! I've always loved you like a father... ... and you cracked my head. Morning! Don't think women despise you because you're mute. Talk to them your way. You'll see you'll find a partner. What's with you talking to me now? I don't understand, mute man. Speak clearer. What? What? Wait, wait. Slower. What kid? THE END
