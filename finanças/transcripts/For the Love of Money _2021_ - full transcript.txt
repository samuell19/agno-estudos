Yes, ma'am. Gigi. Okay. Bye. Okay. Huh? You can't catch me! Sounding good, baby girl. - Finished. - Yeah? Let me hear it. I can't do it with you staring at me. What... All right, baby. Okay. Why did you stop, honey? 'Cause this is the part I'm unsure of. Let me see, honey. It sounded great. Okay, baby. Okay. You see, you were here. And why don't we try this for that part, with the bridge? - What do you think, baby? - Okay. Yeah. It'll be just fine, you're so talented. Just like your mama.

You did it perfectly. Papa. That was nothing short of amazing, my darling, as usual, - but daddy gonna see you later, okay? - Okay. Can I talk to you outside real quick? Just for a second. Yes? I got your petition. It's not happening. - Ashley's tuition went up. - And? - And I need some help. - You should have thought about that before you enrolled her in a school that you couldn't afford. I keep telling you it shouldn't have to be all on me, Greg. Unfortunately for you, that's exactly what full custody means, baby. Oh, is it? 'Cause I thought, regardless of where she lives, she's just as much your daughter as she is mine. Which is why you could have consulted me, but you didn't. She's thriving at that school. You know what? You're missing the whole point. So that's it, just no? Yes. Because if you really wanted my help, you would have listened to me two years ago. Oh, Greg. This is not about you. Right, it's about you. And you doin' whatever the hell you wanna do. Those days are over, Gi, you gotta make a choice. A choice? What-- What are you talking about? Either you're gonna be a boss ass bitch or you're gonna be a beggin' ass bitch. But you can't be both. You can call me when you figure it out. Ashley, honey. Come on, you're gonna miss the bus. Okay! Good morning. Here's your breakfast burrito and your OJ. - I can't find my gym bag. - It's right there, honey. Thank you. I need you to sign this. - What is this? - Something about my tuition? Ms. Wick said she called, but your voicemail was full. - Okay. I'll take care of it. - Thank you. I know my little munchkin wasn't about to leave me. Have a good day. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. All right. Hello? Either you're gonna be a boss ass bitch or you're gonna be a beggin' ass bitch. Damn. - What? - Bad day? Hey, I come in peace. I come in peace. Hey, a brother just wanna say hello. You work here, right? Sales. Well, let me take you to lunch. - No. - No? Why? One, we're not allowed to date members. And two... I'm not interested. You're not interested? Okay. Get that weak mess out of here. Hey, Rob. Hey, Chris. You are early. You know me. Is it a problem? Not at all. I respect your hustle. I always said you were gonna run this joint someday. Chris, I could never see this place without you. You need to give it some thought, though. Right now I got real-world problems to deal with. - All right, babe. - Ooh, what's up, beautiful? - My name is Gigi. - Oh, it's like that today? Last I checked, my name was Gigi yesterday too. Well, Gigi, you look goooood today! We're friends, come on. - Friends? - Friends. Well, that's where we can start. So... You was talkin' all that mess on the court. I bet you ain't got nothin' to say now. Saundra, don't nobody got time for your drama. Come on, bitch! Yes! - What you gonna do? - What? What you gonna do? Shit, somebody call a ambulance! Damn! - What's up, my man? - Good. - Good. - Hey. - Make sure you take good care of that. - Always. All right, now, you gonna be able to run this town one day. - Oh, for sho', for sho'... - For real. Damn! Hello. Brian, if this is one of those scenarios where you accidentally bump into me and touch my butt, don't. It's not one of those days. How about tomorrow? How about the next day? Brian. Jesus, you're so annoying. - Well, persistence always pays off. - No! It does not. Get off me! - Let me go, get off me! - Calm down! She started it! Come here! On the ground! - I didn't-- - Shut that little black ass up! Shit. Chill. Look, I got this. Go. Go, go, go, go. Take a break. I got it. Is there any way I can pay next week? Yes. However, Ms. Davis, I need to be clear. If our tuition is not up to date by next week, we will have no choice but to remove Ashley from our rolls. I understand. Thank you. Can I call my mom? What's the number? 404... 555-9821. You've reached Gigi. Leave me a message. So, Gi, what's going on with you? You looked like you were about to explode. The usual, B. Money and bills. Well, if you would stop and holler at a brother, I might be able to help. Are you talking about that super secret backpack you be getting from Bobby? What? It's not what... it's... Before you say anything else, I'm a single mother who cannot afford to be associated with whatever kind of drug dealing nonsense you got going on. I prefer to get mine in tips. Okay. Really? Can I call my dad, please? I'd like to call my dad, please. What's the number? 404-999... 6135. Daddy? What's up, mama? Are y'all just incapable of calling me by my damn name? Our friend is having a bad day. Oh, I'm ea yin', girl, you are too fine for all that hostility. When the last time you had some vitamin D? Some what? Bobby, don't you have some work to do, brah? Damn, I can't stand nobody who can't take no joke. Oh, shit. Oh-ho-ho! Man, look at this. Look at these two bruisers, they are scrappin'. - Oh, that's a right cross! Oh! - Ow! Fighting like a girl! Where are you going? Oh! Oh-ho-ho! Yo, B, why y'all messin' with the old girl, man? Man... Gigi's on one, man. You know, the usual, man. Look at this right here. They are fightin'! Aw, shit, man. - What? - That's Gigi's daughter. - No! - What?! Oh, shit! Ashley Davis, where is she? B10. - Daddy. - Oh, baby. Oh! I'm so sorry. Daddy's here, baby, Daddy's here. Mommy... Oh! Baby. The cop. It's the cop that caught me, he just kept hitting me... and hitting me. The cop... - Gigi! - Chill out! You'd touch a little girl! Gigi! Gigi! Think you can just do that to a little girl? Huh? What the fuck is wrong with you people? Ma'am, I need you to calm down. - Fuck you! - Mama! - Gigi, hold on! - Easy! Easy! Gigi! Mama, Mama. Please. Calm down, okay? Take Ashley and go. Take Ashley and go home, Gi. Mommy! Come on, baby. Okay, I got you, I got you. I got you. Fix it. - You'll need to fill out-- - Shut the fuck up! I'll take care of the paperwork. - Mama? - Yes, baby. Is Saundra going to die? No. No, no, no. No, baby. But what... What will people think of me? Some girls were taking videos on their phones. It's probably all over TikTok. What have I always told you, honey? - Don't listen to what they say. - Yes. ♪ They say ♪ ♪ Give up ♪ ♪ When the goin' gets tough ♪ ♪ Cliche ♪ ♪ But it's easier to walk away, mm ♪ ♪ You'll say, "I'll be okay" ♪ ♪ Don't listen to what they say ♪ ♪ Trust me, I got you ♪ ♪ I'll never let you down ♪ ♪ No one knows ♪ ♪ All of the thoughts in my head ♪ ♪ That'll leave me in bed ♪ ♪ Thinkin' where to go ♪ ♪ From here ♪ ♪ Step one, two ♪ ♪ You gotta push through ♪ ♪ Step three, four ♪ ♪ So much more ♪ ♪ Five, six ♪ ♪ Just don't quit ♪ ♪ Seven, eight ♪ ♪ Don't listen to what they say ♪ ♪ No ♪ ♪ Just don't listen to what they say ♪ ♪ Mm, no ♪ It's open. Where is Ashley? Is she okay? Finally got her to go to sleep. She's being charged with assault. What? Yeah. The other girl's in the hospital, in a coma. Have you seen our daughter? She's not doing too great, either. I know that. Right now, we need a lawyer. Okay. - Okay? - Okay. This is gonna cost us about $50,000 in legal fees. I'm gonna need you to pay half. That is some bullshit. This is the result of you wanting to run the streets instead of being a real mother, that's what this is. Our daughter was assaulted by cops! On video! And you're blaming me. Are you hearing me? I feel like you're not hearing me. Shh! That will follow her for the rest of her life. She's in the system now, Gi. What about the cops, huh? They in the system too? They will be. I'm gonna handle that shit. That will be a first. Look, I don't even know why I bother coming to fuck with you. Me either. You know what? Just have your 25,000, okay? Motherf... Hey, Brian. I wanna talk to you. Listen, if I'm gonna get in bed with you guys-- Ooh, I like the sound of that shit there. - Is he gonna be a problem? - Bobby's gonna be good. Be cool, Bobby. Go on. As I was saying, if we're going to do this, we have to step up your game. What do you mean? I told you the other day your little operation ain't quite as smooth as you think. Show me why. Okay. You have a runner. Her name is Vanessa. She drops off a backpack full of cash. She then goes to several other local establishments and does the same thing. To add insult to injury, Bobby meets her in public and gives her the backpacks. She gives him a to-go order of food with a check inside the bag. Then she goes to the nail shop and picks up another. It took me two days to figure out how you washed your money. I'm amazed you guys haven't been caught by the Feds already. And I'm amazed you done broke down our whole little operation. Mm-mm-mm. So-so-- So, tell me, are you some kind of fine criminal mastermind or something? So we're clear, what I am is a mother whose daughter is in trouble. That's it. So how do we fix the so-called holes? I know a guy. What kind of guy? The Kind of guy who will quadruple our profits and reduce our risks at the same time. - I'm with that, I'm with it. - Wait, wait, wait a second. - What's wrong? - We're moving a little too fast, no? Yo, Gi, if you got a guy that can bring in that type of dough, guess what? You can count me in. - We need to run this past our guy. - You mean my guy. - Set up a meeting. - He'll be here tonight. All right, you good with this? I guess y'all got it all covered. Good. Let's drink to doing business. Just business, Bobby. You're the one came here with your titties out. Shit. Just business. Quadruple? Quadruple money? - Quadruple. - Quadruple the money. Ooh! Quadruple. Goddamn. Two bottles of Hennessey, four bottles of Success, and a case of Möet. - Got it. - I know you got it. Photographic memory. Uh-huh. Mm-mm-mm! Man, don't tell me you're in there, too, brother. What's up, ma? Brian, this Tre. - What's up? - It's good. Only Tre and I need to be in on this meeting. Y'all can wait outside. - What? Hell no. This is my shit. - Nobody else. Bobby, it's cool. - All right, brother. - I got you. - Man, a'ight. - You're good. I'll see you in a minute. - So... - So. You're about 15 minutes away from the Feds blowing up your whole operation. No risk, no reward, right? What if I could help minimize the drama and increase your profit? So you're just gonna ignore this whole gym thing. I don't have time for games. You here to talk business or not? All right, we could chop it up. Right now you're moving small amounts of cash through a large amount of people. Well, Bobby and Brian are the only two people that know I exist, so... Don't fool yourself. The streets do talk. The streets? You know about the streets, huh? Enough. Hmm. - So, what you proposing? - We build a wall around you. We clean two million a month through our network and pay out in a way that's far removed from anything that ties back to you. And what's that gonna cost me? It's 10%. Okay, beautiful. Tell me about this network. - No. - No? What you mean, no? The whole point is to remove you from anything that could expose you. So I'm supposed to trust you with $2 million of my money? Huh? Speak. Yeah. Yeah? And if anything goes left, that's what you got your boys for, right?? So, how do you know Bobby? We went to school together. I was always about my paper. He wanted in, so... I put him down as family. - Oh. You do know he's dumb, right? - Yeah. Bobby's good people, let's say that. He is good people, he's a nice guy. Hey, enough, enough. Maybe just a half a chromosome away from mental retardation. - Enough! - Okay. All right. I'm just saying you might wanna watch him, he's a wild boy. Yeah, he is a wild boy, but... I hear you. So, what you need from me? Get me the money by the end of the week. I'll get you the money by tomorrow. I mean, you said you had no time for games, right? Well, I guess we have a deal, Mr. Tre. I guess we do. And I like this color on you too. Yeah.

I saw you come in the service today. I hoped you might pop by. Good to see you too, old man. Hold up with the "old man," I still got a few kicks left in me. Service was so beautiful. I needed that. And your congregation is growing. Well, praise the Lord, we do good work. That's actually why we're here. Hmm. We'd like to make a donation. Oh, well... Much appreciated, but as you know, sister Davis, you don't have to come into my office to make donations. There are boxes and plates everywhere. My client here has a friend from a very, very wealthy family. You don't say. Hmm. All right. Are you sure? Oh, yes. - How wealthy? - Two million a month. Well... you are most welcome in the house of the Lord, my brother. - Praise the Lord. - Praise the Lord. We can have the first installment to you in just a few days. Ninety day turnaround good? Ten percent commission, 60/40 split. Thank you for your kind generosity, sister Davis. The pleasure's all mine, Pastor. Ahem. I-- Gigi, uh... Would you do me a favor? There's only one woman more beautiful than you, and if you should happen to see her, tell her I said hello, would you? I'll tell mama you said hi. I'll be damned. I-- I-- I'm not quite sure I know what just happened. You know what you need to know. - Okay? It's better that way. - Okay. You are full of surprises. Life can be like that sometimes. Wow. Well, you know what they say about life. When life gives you lemons... Make a gin and tonic and throw the lemon on the rim for garnish. Well, gimme my lemon. Yeah. This is gonna be dope. Yes, it is. This is gonna be business. There's no reason business can't have pleasure, right? Look, I'm not here for all that. This is a short-term deal for me. I just need to make enough money to take care of my daughter's situation and I'm out. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. - I got it. - All right. We'll get through this together... - Yeah. - ...and do the things we need to do. - You know what I mean? - That's right. So, what's next? Tre sent this. Well... Time to go to work. Good afternoon, Your Honor. Good afternoon. Where are we on this? The State's agreed to drop all the charges against Ashley Davis. In conjunction, Your Honor, my client has agreed to not sue the city for her daughter's injuries. It is with complete agreement from all parties that the officer responsible for said injuries be terminated immediately. And we're all in agreement on this? - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, Your Honor. Good. Your cut. And the expenses for your colleagues. Well, damn, Gigi. What you lookin' like brand-new money? - Every job has its perks, right? - Mm-hmm. - Ho, shit. - Mm-hmm. Whoo. Look like somebody gonna buy me some brand-new shit myself. - I'll holla at ya. - All right, Bobby. I'd like to pay the tuition for my daughter Ashley Davis. I'd like to pay for the rest of the year. - Congratulations. Here you go. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. Let's go for a ride. Oh, my God, I'm excited! Wait! How did... Let's toast to your success. Thank you. - Congratulations. - I appreciate you. - Sexy walk. - Mm-hmm. You might be all right, man. - What? - You might be all right. - What up, boss? - Checkin' in. How we lookin'? Good shit. I'm making these drops right now as we speak. Good. - Hit me when you're done. - All right. Thank you, sir. It's a pleasure doing business with you. I look forward to many more days like this. What? What the hell are y'all doing in my house? Look. The door was unlocked, I knocked. I guess you didn't hear me come in. You got my package? Coming here is completely off-script. Well, I'm rewriting the script. And the first change is Bobby's running point on all my transactions. I don't think that's a good idea. Look, I don't know you. And I definitely don't know if I can trust you. Bobby's like family. I trust him. Just like that? Hmm. Just like that. - So why the change? - Listen. Why, why don't matter. Bobby is my man, see? Now tell him what to do. Come on. You're the boss. First, you need to go to several banks and open up accounts. They need to be in different names, so you'll need ID. I'll give you a set of checks and you deposit them. Make sure you only make one deposit per account. We don't wanna arouse any suspicions. Right, girl, I got this. This ain't brain surgery. This is not rocket science. Okay, Einstein. Whoa, speaking of Einstein... Hey, baby. Um, what kind of drawers you got on? You got the pink ones on? Good. I hope you took them big white ones off. Take them off. Thank you. This is not gonna work. - It's workin'. - I'm serious. Tre, one wrong move can mess this whole thing up. Then I suggest you train him well, then. You're the boss. Goddamn right, I'm the boss. Good night, Gigi. Oh, this green is pretty. Oh, it is. Oh. What's that all about? What's what all about? That old cheesy grin you got from your daddy plastered all over your face. Things are good, that's all. You seein' somebody? Ma, it is not 1970. My happiness is not tied to a man. Okay, then what? 'Cause you sure been lookin' awfully fancy lately. Mm-hmm. It's just that, for the first time... probably since the divorce... I finally feel free. - Let's sit down. Yeah. - Wanna sit? Okay. Ah, yeah. Yeah, I just... I finally feel like I don't need anyone's permission or approval to do what I wanna do. And that's what you want? Isn't that what everybody wants? I don't know. You know, from my experience... doing it alone could be... tough. Yeah, well, I tried the whole marriage and family thing, and we see how that turned out. Well, you don't have to give up. I don't have to put my life on hold either. Remember when we used to come here? Baby. I know you think you got it all figured out, and maybe you do. But, baby girl, there's more to life than just making money. Now, do you need a man to make you happy? No. But I also don't want you to end up alone. Maybe the right one needs to just find me. I'm so done putting my life on hold. I know what I wanna do and I'm finally clear on where I wanna go. Well, just know it's awfully lonely at the top, baby girl. I understand. I'm built for it. Mm-mm-mm. Good afternoon. How can I help you? I'm here to make a deposit, and, uh... get your number. Well, I can help you with your deposit, mister...? Big Rob, but my friends call me Bobby. B-Smoove, B-Nice, or just B. Hmm. Okay. That's a lot of names. - I'm a lot of man. - All right. - Let me see what we have. - Mm-mm-mm. - Big business, doing big things. - Okay. Let's see here. Two million dollars. Big man doing big business, baby. Damn, but you're real fine. Can I get your Snapchat though? Sure. Like that, huh? Have a good day. You too. Hi. I think you need to come take a look at this. - I'll be right down. - Thank you. I need y'all to help me welcome to the stage Chris "The King" Connolly! - You need to slow down. - I can't slow down. Man, look, man, you drinkin' like a damn fish, dawg. You gotta live life, motherfucker. Shit. How y'all doing this evening? I'm gonna keep this short but sweet. After 20 years of grinding here at Club Symphony, it's time for your boy to step on down. Oh, no! - What the hell was that? - Man, how-- How we gonna run game? But I don't want y'all to get this twisted. Because it's getting ready to get bigger and better. Introducing the new club owner of Symphony. Put your hands together for my girl, your girl, Miss Gigi Davis! She be worth it. That motherfucker there, it's my shit now! I like her. I like her a lot. Thank you, Mr. C. I have to say in front of everyone thank you so much for being such a positive influence on me and everyone here at this club. I've learned so much from you and... I'm gonna miss you.

Excuse you? Ain't... ain't we the new... the new owners, right? - We need to talk. - Not right now. - I need to go get me another drink. - I'm not asking. Hey, what the-- what the hell y'all supposed to do? I told you we need to talk. And I told you fuck off, Gigi. You always fuckin' with me. Bobby, don't make me embarrass you more than you already have. Bitch, bitch, get out my face. I'm not gonna be too many more bitches tonight. Bitch, didn't you hear Tre? I'm running this shit. Huh? I put your sorry ass on. You wouldn't be shit without me. You got one more time to call me a bitch. Bitch, fuck... Ow! Damn. Gigi, that's how you wanna play? Huh? That's how you wanna play? - Yep. - I'm gonna see your ass soon. Y'all too big, bitch. Congratulations on your new spot. - Right? - Oh, Brian. Partners, right? Hey, what's up, Brian? So you bought the club, too. Well, if you want big things, you have to make big moves. Yeah, well... I still think you're moving too fast. See, that's your problem right there, Brian. You think too small. Brian, Chris gave me an opportunity and I took it. Simple as that. I'm tired of working for other people. It was time for me to have something of my own, so I took my cut and I bought the club. And I was thinking that you and I could do it together. We make a good team. We're supposed to be a team? Can't you just be happy for me? Hello? Bye, Brian. No, I'm not happy for you. I just want her to do so well. - Come on, come on! - Let's go, baby! You need some water. No, no, baby, you stay. I'll get it. Ahem. I'll be back. Stay on your toes! Move your feet now! - Hey. - Hey. Ashley didn't tell me you were coming. I wanted to surprise her. - Oh, okay. - And you. - Maybe. - Really? I did want to bring this to your attention, though. Um... Your new place of business is being investigated for money laundering. Yeah. We've been watching these guys for a while now. And it's starting to make me feel like... your new investment might just be another case of Gigi's bad luck. I don't have nothing to do with these people at all. Got some new shoes, huh? You know, you ever wonder why... some people, no matter how nice the shoes, just can't keep themselves from stepping in shit? Oh, well. Just consider this a courtesy call, uh... You know, a baby head start, you know what I'm saying? Okay, Greg. Don't let me catch you. Hey! How you doin'? D-up, baby, d-up! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Yeah, my baby got some skills on her. You know you get that from your daddy's side of the family, right? Yeah, you got the height from your mother. Gigi, don't make me take you out on that court. Greg, don't make me dunk on you. Hey, Ashley, nana's gonna take you home, okay? - All right, great game. - Thank you. I love you. - Good job. - I love you too, baby. - Can you take her, please? - See you all later. - Oh, it's cold. - All right, be safe. I almost wanna say thank you. She was actually really-- What's up, mama? This a bad time? Yeah. Yeah, this is a bad time. This is... where you walk off. - Come again? - Are you deaf? - I said walk the fuck off. - Who the fuck-- Tre, can you give us a minute, please? What, you-- you know this clown? Yeah, nigga, I'm her new man. What's up? So that's where you're getting your new shoes from? You think you're all that 'cause you fuckin' a dope boy now? I'm gonna need a little bit more respect coming out of your mouth, homie, for real. No, this is all you need to respect, homie, for real for real. So this is how this is gonna go. Tomorrow morning I'm filing for full legal and physical custody of our daughter. - What? - Yes. Our daughter. And you won't be contesting the filing because if you do, then I'll be compelled to tell the court exactly why I'm petitioning, and I don't think neither one of y'all can have that. Wow, wow! - Greg, don't do this. - You did this! It's already done. But look at the bright side, now you got all the time in the world to have a whole project apartment full of lyin' ass, drug-dealin' ass, uneducated children with no morals or self-respect. - Tre. - No, no, no, no. Your fucking ex is a fed? - Hey, don't... Don't say shit to me, man. - Tre! Tre. Shit! Who was that guy at Ashley's school? I knew you would ask that. Mm-hmm. Then who is he? Just a friend. Girl, do you think I'm that stupid? Ma, I love you. And I respect you. But I'm grown now. I don't have to explain myself to you. Yeah. Well, I guess... you don't have to explain this either, huh? - Huh? - Ma. Why are you going through my stuff? What are you doing with a briefcase full of dope money? Whatever you have going on, you need to stop it. - Now. - I know what I'm doing. Do you? Do you really? Hmm? Who's gonna take care of your daughter when you go to jail? Or worse. - Please stop. - No, damn it, you stop! Mom. Let's get you something. I didn't raise you... to get into this mess. Mom. I'm not dad. I'm not into any gangster stuff. I'm not on drugs. I'm not trying to shoot the city up. This is just business. Business? With a briefcase full of cash. I've been through this... madness... with your father. Do you know how many so-called hustlers I've seen... who think they figured out how to beat the system? It's a pipe dream. You know why? Because you can't beat the system. Sooner or later, every hustle comes to an end. Mommy. Get some rest. Come on. Get up. Come on. Please. I got you. Baby... Let me just say this, okay? The only players that make it to the end of this game... winds up doing time... or dead... or in a wheelchair like your father. Think about it. - I love you. - I love you too. Fu... What the hell is this? Frozen? Oh, no, no, no! Damn! Man, we got a problem. Hey, Pastor. Blessings. We have an issue. What's wrong? One of your associates broke protocol and got their accounts frozen. Are you serious? Kidding you is not something I do. You need to handle this. Okay. I'm on it. You remember what we talked about, okay? Keep your rhythm. Fight! Don't forget to let that jab go, okay? - You all right? - I got it. Keep your hands up. I'm built for this. Fight! Baby, don't forget your iPad. Why do I have to live with dad? - It's just for a little while. - How long? I don't know. Will you please help me get your stuff together? Why won't you just tell me what's going on? It is not the time. Now, will you please help me get your stuff together? Ashley? Honey, come here. Your dad went to the courts and got the judge to grant him temporary custody. - Is this because of the fight I got into? - No, baby, no. No. This has nothing to do with that. You're not to blame, okay? Okay, well, then... what if I don't wanna go? Unfortunately that's not up to you. Or me. I don't want this either, baby. Just know that your dad and I love you very much. We want what's best for you. We just don't agree on what that is right now. Hey, we're gonna be okay. We're gonna get through this, okay? Come here. - Grandma. - Baby. Now, listen to me. Both of y'all. This family has been through worse than this. A lot worse. My house, your daddy's house, this house... ...ain't nothing but four walls and some furniture. What matters is that we are family, and that will never change, regardless of where you sleep at night. - Understand? - Yeah. Yeah. It's time to go. - Mama. - Come here. What happened to my money? Hmm? Bobby did exactly what I told him not to do. Bullshit, I did what I always do. You can't possibly be this fucking stupid! You had one job, one! - Shh! - One... Tell me about my money, Gigi. He deposited the entire two million into one account. - What? - All at once. The IRS flagged it, it's frozen. He can't be trusted. He was probably drunk when he did this shit. Let me tell you somethin', I ain't never been drunk. Now, I might have been a little fucked up, but I wasn't drunk, and I can be trustworthy! You the one that can't be trusted! Especially coming from somebody who got a ex-husband as a fed. This ain't about me. Bullshit! It been about you, Gigi. The day since you came in, it been about Gi-gi. We was doin' just fine until your ragged ass came in here and got us caught up in your bullshit. You were doing just fine? You were a RICO prosecution waiting to fucking happen. You should know, huh? Tre, gimme the word. I been waitin' to pop this bitch. I don't have time for this shit. I gotta clean up your mess. Tre. You know, Bobby was the closest thing I had to a brother. Yet I just put a fucking bullet in his head for fucking with my money! Look at him, look at him. I said fuckin' look at him. Look at him! - Okay. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, get real close. Get real fucking close. Yeah. I wanna know everything. From this moment, I need to know every fucking thing that's going on with my money, you hear me? - Tre, it's... - Shut the fuck up! Shut up! Hmm... Yeah. You know, Gigi, shit's changed. I need you to call whoever's in charge, "cause I'm gonna need somebody to tell me what the fuck's going on, or I'll start doing things my way. Hmm? Open your fuckin' mouth, open your mouth. If I could do that to my best friend, what the fuck you think I'd do to a bitch ass federal prosecutor, a whore of a ex wife, or a piece of shit for a daughter? Huh? Clean this shit up. Sorry for barging in. Uh, my client Tre is curious about how all this works. I assume this stems from our little bump in the road? Correct. He insists on having more information. - A lot more. - Insists? Yeah. Is that a problem? - Son, slow-- -Wait, wait, wait, no. "Son"? Nigga, I'm not your son and you definitely ain't my father. No, no, no, so what's going on with my money, man? You brought that to make your point? I wasn't planning on having much conversation with you, old man. Granted, I'm not as young as I once was, but, uh, in that amount of time, I was able to learn a couple things. What I learned was, what's better than being tough is being prepared. Excellent. Tre. Have a seat. Are you familiar with the term "Black Wall Street"? No, I'm not. Black Wall Street is the most successful black economy in American financial history. That is, until it was burned to the ground, the entire city, by white supremacists in 1921. And what's that got to do with me, man? Well, everything disappeared except the intangibles. The buildings and the banks were destroyed, but, uh, the information, the knowledge, the connections, the network, that remained. And... what are we doing? Tre, you are talking to the head of the largest, longest-running most successful money-laundering operation in the history of this country. So the church is a front? The Lord works in mysterious ways. This particular way is one where we have an institution that's under our complete control without being challenged. And, uh, we use that behind the scenes to further the interests of the black community in every way and situation that we can. Also, as a side note, primarily a cash business. The point is, your money is perfectly safe. Well, how would I be sure? Give me $20. Thank you, sister, for your kind donation of $10. You mean $20. That was $10. But she just gave you $20. I'm gonna need you to prove that or say "allegedly." The secret is in the simplicity. - So that's it? - That's it. - Well, how does it work if you-- - Hold on. Before we go any further... What I shared with you thus far, I shared with you so that you could have peace of mind, so that you could feel better. But any further conversation is a bit much for me to be having with an outsider, to be honest. Well, I mean... two million dollars, I would think, puts me on the inside, so... What's funny? Let's just say you're not one of his bigger clients. I don't give a shit, I told you I need to know about my money, so what's going on with my money? Before you accidentally insult the Lord and I... Gigi, your call. Go ahead. My misunderstanding. It's just a financial issue. The Lord has blessed us to not have financial issues. What's this? That is to thank you for the assistance that you gave in building the senior center that the community has been looking forward to for ten years. And that one is for the basketball gymnasium that you supplied the buildout for. The community appreciates that as well. That should help with the money frozen in your account. Just like that? Just like that. Just like Gigi said. The secret is the simplicity. Okay. Thank you. Ashley, have you seen Daddy's-- Oh, it's right here. I'm moving way too fast this morning. Whoo! You about ready? Better get you dropped off so I can get to my meeting. Yeah, almost. Can I call Mom when I come back home? Of course you can, baby. You don't need permission to call your mom. Yeah, only to see her. Ashley, we've been through this SO many times. And every time you and Mama get into a fight, I'm the one that gets stuck in the middle. It's not fair. Life isn't fair. Okay? It's about time you learned that. I'm sorry. I'm doing the best I can with what I've been given. If you do something or your mom does something to make it worse, it just makes it harder for me. I'm doing my best. Well... forgive us for being such a burden. Ashley... Ashley, don't be like that. That's not what I'm trying to say. What are you doing here? Good morning to you too. What are you doing here, Gi? Greg, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I cheated on you. I'm sorry I broke up our family. I'm sorry I broke up our marriage.

Hey... ahem. I was on my way out. I gotta pick my daughter up. I don't want my ex to... again. Speaking of your ex... how do I say this? Ahem. Your ex, if he didn't have that badge, I would have slapped the shit out that motherfucker. But-but-but... I do love the fact that he's a good father. See, I never knew my dad. You know, he went to prison right after I was born, and somebody killed him... not too long after that. So I never really... I never had the luxury of knowing what it felt like to have a father's love, you know? Yeah, it's fucked up. But I gotta admit... your ex... he got it down to a science. Look. Look. He's a good daddy. He's a good dad. Let's zoom in so you can see her big. She's a pretty little thing, ain't she? Yeah. Just like her fine-ass mama. Damn. I think we have an understanding, Gigi. And I think everything's gonna be just fine. So tell your, uh, beautiful family... Tre said hi. What? Hello? What? Oh... Okay, I'll be right there. No... ma... Thank you for coming. There isn't anywhere else in the world for me to be other than here. Why didn't I know the most beautiful woman in the world was sick? She didn't want anyone to know. She still loved you. Yeah. Love was not one of the issues. She just realized wasn't the best environment for raising a child. She wanted what was best for you. Hey, Grandpa. Oh. - Are you okay? - Yes. Hey. You okay, honey? - You all right? - Yeah, I'm good, Daddy. Daddy, can I ride with Mom? Please? - Yeah, of course. I don't see why not. - Yeah. - You good? - Yes, thank you. - How are you doing, Pastor? - Gregory. Good to see you. Unbelievable. Look, you have to ride with me, all right? Tell your mother you're gonna see her later. - But you just said... - No buts, Ashley. Okay? This is almost incredible. You really don't get it. - Excuse me. - Sorry about your mother-in-law. What's he doing here? I don't know. I didn't invite him. I just, uh... wanted to pay my respects. - Sorry for your loss. - Thank you. Take care. All right, cool. All right, so I'm gonna bring the other half. Yeah, I'm gonna bring the other half tonight. It appears your associate is a loose cannon. I know. Knowing is half the battle. It's time to take out the trash. I'm on it. Ahem. I'm... so sorry about that. I had to take that. It's okay. - Thanks for coming. - Now, of course, you know? I'm here for you, you know? I mean, uh... maybe you should come to the crib when this is done. Hmm. I've got to spend time with the family today. How about tomorrow? - Yeah, tomorrow works. - Okay. All right. I gotcha. Hey, what's up? Burning the midnight oil too, huh? Yeah. Did you cash a check for 25 grand a few days ago? It's been traced back to an account linked to the laundering scheme.

So... maybe that night, in that moment... you didn't have a choice. Mom? Yeah. All I'm saying is, right here, right now, you do. You have a choice.
