Shit, man, I would freak. Exactly. And... and it's times like this that remind us of all the things our mothers have taught us over our lives. Such as what? Such as you don't just jump into bed with someone. Unless you've dated 'em. You want to date? No. I mean... actually, that's a really good idea. I think the two of you should get to know each other better. What about tomorrow night, victor? - That's great. - I have plans with the guys tomorrow night... I can't. So why don't you take him with you? I'm sure they won't mind. - But you don't... - I don't mind. Anthony, you swore to me, and I trusted you. So, what are you saying? You know exactly what I'm saying. If I don't sleep with victor, that's it? No, you pick whatever man you want, and I'll pick whatever woman I want. Can't we just forget the whole thing? That didn't seem to be an option when I suggested it. I made a mistake, all right. Anthony, look, you can't help your fantasy. And I don't want it hanging over my head anymore.

Look, the point here is that I made a promise to the woman I love. I don't know what I'm gonna do. So... just take the guy out. - What? - What? I'm not saying he has to actually do anything. I'm just saying that if she sees that he's going through with it, she'll put on the brakes. Then you won't be breaking your promise. You think? - Sure. - [snickers] Well, I mean, actually we're all supposed to take him out. All: We? I told him we had plans tonight. Wait a second. We, as in me, nick? You're crazy. I'm not doing it.

Probably to please her boyfriend before she takes part in a catholic wedding! Can I help you? [upbeat music] I got it. I don't know why I didn't think of it before. What? Well, you said that amy said that she would help you with your fantasy if you helped her with hers, right? Right. So, it's your fantasy for hers. That's the deal? Yeah. So if you could... suppress your fantasy, erase it from your mind... you wouldn't owe her anything. That's not gonna work. Why not? Have you ever tried to suppress a fantasy? [dings] Hey! Hi. Michelle, right? Yeah. Can I help you with something? Oh, yeah. I need some furniture. Uh-huh. Okay. Uh, what do you need? Oh, you know, just... furniture. [laughs] Okay. Cabinets? Yeah. Cabinets.

I didn't tell you to do it here. Well, I thought I was alone. You know, maybe if you have to go through with this thing it's not the worst thing in the world. Seems like a nice kid. You sleep with him. Look, anthony, all I'm saying is that he could have been some old bald, dirty, hairy guy. I just hope you don't hurt his feelings. Oh, please. You don't just become a lesbian. [dings] - it's not what I meant. Well, I'll tell you something. Somebody asked me to do something I didn't want to do... I'd be out of there like that. I love him. Well, then in that case, you're fucked. [pats] hey, hassan, how's it hanging? Oh, just a little to the left, and you? Just right, baby. - This good? - Yeah, good. Your new friend? Ah... yeah. Well, maybe. [both laugh] So what do you think it is about guys wanting to see 2 women together? Well, let's see. From my dyke perspective. I would have to say that the fantasy results from a guy's overattachment to his mother's breast. Instead of 2, he needs 4. Anthony is very attached to his mother. You think that's it? Mm. No. I mean, what do I know what people need, right? But I tell you what I do know. In the few times that I did have the experience, when a woman's really having a good time, I mean really having a good time... you know, not trying to put a performance on for the guy, he freaks out. You think? You think? I know. I mean, the guy's sitting there thinking my thing is so big I need 2 chicks. Meanwhile, the girls having a good time with no thing, and we realize how useless his thing is. So, this guy comes up to me, and he says: "What has 2 thumbs and likes blowjobs?" I don't know. What? He goes, "this guy!" okay. That's why I don't date men. Hey, yo, ames. Come on and play with me. Oh, hey, clarence. No, I can't. We're talking right now. no, no, no. Go ahead. Oh, shit. You're drinking a 40? No, a 45. - Oh. - [laughs] Yo, I got a dollar says you can't score off me. That's big talk for a squirt like you, clarence. Who you calling squirt, woman? Who you calling a woman, squirt? Should I take him? - Go ahead. - Come on, clarence. Ready to lose a dollar? I ain't losing nothing. Very nice! Keep your dollar, clarence. We'll go double or nothing next time. See ya, ames. - [sighs] - very well done. Wasn't a thing. You must come here a lot. [laughs] - yeah. I like it here. [sighs] You remember this old crack house burnt down? Yes. Well, this is where I met anthony. Oh! Now I get it. He's a crackhead. - [Laughs] That's very, very romantic. No, even better. You were walking by and you saw this guy with a really big hose... [laughs] And you just had to have it. - That's it. - Oh, the love! No. Actually, I was just trying to get home from work one day, and I saw this building going down. As I'm walking by, that's where I found anthony. Hiding in the corner. He was crying like a baby. I didn't know if he had gotten hurt or... or if someone he knew had gotten hurt or what. And so now I was going to keep going... I don't know. Something made me stop. And, um, I found myself offering him a tissue. [laughs] At which point he threw his arms around me, and he started crying, um... "I didn't see him. I didn't see him." who? This kid he saved. He was all upset because he almost missed him. That's a very lovely story. [laughs] A little weird. He's very sensitive. - He is. - I know. He really is. I know. And the other thing I get all the time is that I'm a lesbian because I hate men. I mean, why would I hate them? I don't have to sleep with them, you know. [laughs] Ah! Hey, venus, baby! Fill me up. Oh my god. Is that what time it is? Oh, is that what time you want it to be? No. No, no. I was supposed to go eat some sample food with anthony and his mother. - Sample what? - Surf and turf. I was supposed to pick out food for the caterer to serve at the wedding. But I'm way late. Anthony gets really pissed off when his mother's involved. You know, he does this pouty hall monitor thing. It's like... i don't know what it is. But I'm... i'm... i shouldn't make fun of him anyway. Why not? Unless he pisses me off. [laughs] [both laugh] Well, I tell you what, I tell you... I think he should start appreciating what he's got instead of wanting something else. Very well spoken. [clinks] [laughter, blowing] [unlocks] - where have you... - Hi, sweetie. - Anthony. - Come on in. - [laughs] Oh, he does look like a pouty monitor guy. We were supposed to meet my mom an hour and a half ago. [together] surf and turf. Come on. You're drunk. No, I only had a few beers. Wait, I want to tell... Tell you something. I think you need some sleep. I don't want to go to sleep. [sighs] - All right. - [mumbling] ♪ She's a very nice girl. I know. She's very cute, too. Honk. All right, I'll go. Tell her I'll see her tomorrow then. [jangling] [kisses] Heart-shaped toasts. Aren't they sweet? They're great, ma. - Aren't they. - They're cute. Try one. They're made with cookie cutters. It's in martha stewart. They're real good, mom. Salmon roe. Just like caviar. Uh, that is caviar. Oh, this is going to be the classiest reception. Better than your cousin theresa's. [sighs] Are you going to tell me what happened or not? Anthony, would you stop? - Nothing's going on. - Then... now we have crab cakes with shrimp and snow peas. Of course, your mother's worried there might be too much fish. Oh, no, actually, amy loves fish. - What's that supposed to mean? - What do you think it means? I think he thinks you like fish. I know what he thinks, and he's wrong. Fish was your fantasy. Yeah, but I can I trust you with the fish? Trust? If you ask me, fish is an acquired taste. Exactly. So we're also thinking about sausage! - [laughs] - that's great, ma. - Would you like to try one? - Oh, I think he should. Although I'm not sure I can trust him with the sausage. [sighs] You can trust me with the sausage, okay? I tell you everything that happens with the sausage. I'm just not sure I can trust you with the fish. Anthony, you know what... why don't we just go with the stuffed mushrooms. Fine. [slams] Oh, shit! [Slams] [jingling] [slams] [sighs] [whispers] fuck. [slams] Oh. - Hey. - Hey. Meeting clarence? No. No, I'm not... I'm not meeting clarence. Ta-da! - [laughs] - foot stool. Thanks. It's beautiful. Thank you. Little pre-wedding gift. Thank you. I didn't really need a foot stool though. I know. [laughs] [sighs] [clears throat] Hey, uh, I caught you in the middle of something. You want to be alone, I'll go. No. I... I was, um... just having a little nervous breakdown. It's okay. It's, um, done. [sighs] [knocking] Come in. Hey, father s. Hey, anthony. I wasn't expecting you for a... What did you do to your arm? It's just a break. Have a seat. I was going to confess, but what I really need is some advice. What can I do? See, I asked somebody to do this awful thing, you know. But when I asked them I didn't really think it was so awful. What made you realize it was awful? I guess it was the reality of it. You know, just how it worked out. I see. And now I'm supposed to do the same awful thing myself. Anthony... are you sure this awful thing is really so awful? I don't know for sure. Why? I've known you since you were a boy. I can't imagine that you would ask somebody to do something so awful that you wouldn't be willing to do it yourself. [clicks] [keys jingling] [sniffs] Welcome to my humble abode! [laughs] Wow. It's nice. Thanks. [locking] [thuds] Want something to drink? No, no. [laughs] Did you make all these? Uh, yeah, most are my design. Some restorations. Who's this? Oh, um, that's my ex, mona. Your ex. Why do you have her... picture still up? Told her if she, uh, got her shit together she wanted to come back... I haven't heard from her in 8 months. [laughs] So, this is what you do, huh? Yep. [soul music on radio] - [laughs] - wrong way. Straight like that. [clears throat] Thinking of taking up wood carving? [laughs] [clears throat] [whispers] gonna take that. [upbeat music] [knocking] [together] hi! Wrong apartment. [Slams] [knocking] - What? - Anthony? - Yeah? - Nava. Nava hannibal. Amy's mother? Oh, I'm so sorry. Please, come in, come in. It's been so long since that one time we, uh... - nelson. - I know. What happened to your arm? It's nothing, really. Please. [shuffling] [both laugh] Um, where's amy? [Laughs] Nowhere. I mean, shopping. Oh. Shopping? For furniture. We came straight from the hotel. The plane was a little early. [laughs] - though who knows how. [laughs] the bangladeshi airline system... It's amazing that we got here in one piece. [both laugh] [knocking] Just one minute. Hey, anthony. Yo, amy's across the... - Hey! Oh! Hey! - Hi. - I'm nava. - Nelson hannibal. Good to know you. you're amy's parents, right? - Mm-hmm. - Hey, I'm victor. Aw! It's nice to finally meet some of your friends. Yo, amy's with michelle right now. - Hey! - Who's michelle? She's... you know, nobody. She... victor was just leaving. Oh, that's a shame. We were hoping to take you all out. - For dinner? - Right. Hey, far out. Get michelle and amy. We'll have a big, fun party. - Cool. - But the the thing is, uh... victor can't. yes, I can. I'll go get 'em. No, no, no! Uh... unless you want me to let them stay there. No, no, no. Okay. Go get them. After the peace corps, our wanderlust still wasn't sated. [laughs] So nelson took a job with green peace. I teach. And we just bummed around from country to country. Cool. Of course, we were worried about amy. But kids are so resilient. Oh, anthony, did she ever tell you about the time at the israeli summer camp? - Oh. - Oh. - Oh! - [laughter] - Very funny. - Well... [laughter] - no. Amy was 8, 9 maybe. So, we signed her up. [laughs] well, little did we know there was marching and gun practice. And then they forced amy to play that type of capture the flag type game. Well, amy got captured, and then she talked her way out of prison. [laughs] it was an illegal seizure. [all laughing] and then she got out. [together] and she captured the flag single-handedly. [all laughing] I never heard that one. Hmm. I said at the time either she's going to be a lawyer or a dictator. [laughter] Of course, of course, we were hoping for a dictator. [laughs] - dad! - Just kidding, honey. - Oh, anthony. Your mother has been so sweet to handle all the planning. I can't wait to meet her. She lives for this kind of stuff. Ah. Well, do you have any last minute stuff that you haven't taken care of? Just the usual stuff, you know. We have our final conference with father sebastian at church tomorrow morning. Hmm. [Mumbling] Want to try the california roll? Man, it's so awesome. Honey, you haven't told me who you maid of honor's gonna be. Oh. Well, actually I just asked michelle. [coughs] And I accepted. - Good. - Oh! [all laughing] I thought you said heather was doing it? She got stuck on a case in london. What about your friend in france? Oh, selange, no. She's stuck in antarctica on a field study. Honey, where's your ring? I haven't seen your engagement ring. Oh, I think that, um... actually... actually, i... actually, I have it. You must have left it on the counter when you were doing the dishes. That must have been what... What I did. [laughs] - Hmm. - Oh, isn't that lovely? [oohing and ahhing] isn't that beautiful? It's a shame that the boys made plans. Unless you can think of a fun place we can go? It just seems a little strange to me that she knows you 24 hours, and she already knows your whole life history. Anthony, why are we having this conversation? Did you tell her the pickled herring story? - What? - Yes or no? What is your problem? How would you feel if victor and I were keeping secrets from you? Look, she wanted to know what kind of games I played as a kid. It's no big deal! Well, maybe it's no big deal to you. But I thought we had no secrets. I'm not having this conversation. Honey, we're going to the pussycat club. It's like I'm all ready to beg for her forgiveness, and then I see her doing that. Were they using their tongues? Must you make this disgusting? I thought that's what you wanted. All I wanted was me, amy, another girl and a little romance. I didn't want her doing it behind my back. What if they fall in love? She's not gonna fall in love. Just like you're not gonna fall in love with victor. Then why were they kissing? [crunches] she's doing it for you, anthony. Testing the waters. [crunching] Man, this whole thing. I mean, it's just gotten completely out of control. I can't believe I'm the only one wearing a dress. Would you shut up with that already. What? I'm comfortable in my manhood, anthony, that's all. Besides, if I got to scratch my nuts, they're right here. Yeah, and I know you ain't gonna touch 'em with those hands. Right? [Door slams] Yo, you guys look so good. Ah, you know, just call me, nikita. My girlfriend over here's cyrila. - I'm still going by dom. - [laughs] Hey, where's your wig? Yo, shit, I had to steal it from my mom's closet.

I don't... he thinks that I lied to him. - I saw you with her. - Excuse me? First, they were kissing... anthony, we didn't do anything. Would you just drop it? kissing?

And I forgive you. - Please. - Anthony... look, I'm willing to sleep with victor, okay. I mean, I even bought him home last night. Anthony, you just don't get it, do you?!
