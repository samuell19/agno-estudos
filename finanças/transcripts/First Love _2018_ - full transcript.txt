--== McEphie ==-- Maybe that is their heart's lifelong burden, this heavy, deeply-rooted feeling they carry every day. Until one day, the heart can no longer take it and it breaks down, broken and shattered. So, always remember… there's someone on the other side of the world, or someone a block away, Maybe they are thinking And maybe you're the last person this would be it. If only I had learned that sooner. Then this wouldn't have happened to me. I have already forgotten many things and missed so many opportunities. The postcards are pretty. You just have poor taste. You are the one I love If I don't make it to my hearing later, I won't put in a good word for you with the judge. About the shares you have in your company with Steve, he agreed to get them at 1.7. It was a pain to talk to him. That's what I like about you. I told you I was fine even at 1.5. So, aside from my expensive lawyer's fee, what are you going to do with the money? I won't stick around, either. I need to check on something. Like you, I have plenty of free time now because you've already finished most of the work. I'm only doing this because you're my friend. Help! Sir, are you a Filipino? Help! -Yes. Lay him down! -Let's take him to the hospital. -Oh my God! -Wait! We have to bring him to the hospital or he may die! There, there's a car. Sir, you're stressing me out. Thank you! I thought he was going to die. I thought he was going to save me. I never knew I could be a bad person. Don't leave me yet, OK? I'm Ali. Did you buy all of these? I think this is destiny. -Coffee? -I don't drink coffee. You pulled a fast one on me. You're always at the hospital? Yes, since my father suffered a cardiac arrest. I have a heart condition I inherited from him. I have HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. For four years, I've been in and out of the hospital. The doctors have done all they possibly could. Did I tell you I have an implant? Here. I have an implant. So, if my heart is having a hard time, it can get help so I don't die. Is that why you're hoping for a donor? Yes, because I need my heart replaced. It's a good thing I'm here in Canada. Imagine if I were in the Philippines. I'd probably be dead. I would be with my father already. Papa. You know, you don't look sick. You don't look like someone who needs a new heart. Why? Are you saying I'm a liar? -You're driving me crazy. -I look beautiful indeed. Have you heard of the "talk test"? "Talk test"? What's that? It's a test for the heart. If you are having a hard time talking while walking, stop first. I'm going to stop first. Are you all right? You're so talkative. Who else will talk? Your turn. Me? What can I tell you? I've been here a long time. Maybe 22 years or more. Wow. I've also had different jobs. I've been a boatman, caregiver, property developer. I've done everything! And now I'm a venture capitalist. What's that? An adviser of small companies that want to expand their businesses. We assess if they should invest. So, you're good at assessing risks. What about wife and kids? My father and siblings are in the Philippines. I don't have a wife. Even with your good looks? since you're good at assessing risks, what about us? Do you think we could grow? What do you mean? This! Us! I don't know. What about you? What do you think? Me? I don't need to assess anymore. I'll take the risk. I feel better now. That's just it, right? When the universe comes knocking, you just need to open the door. As the saying goes: You believe that? Of course! Like what happened today. We bumped into each other, someone collapsed… He was a heart donor, and I thought his heart could replace mine, but apparently not. Instead, someone stole my heart. You. A Filipino. You, Nick, the most handsome guy in Vancouver. -You know what I'm saying? -Hold on a second. I'm confused. Destiny brought us together. Get it? Couldn't it just be a coincidence? No! It's not a coincidence. Coincidence would be like… Fate is random people or events What's our purpose? You won't know the purpose until it happens. I want to drive you home, but I don't drive anymore. Don't worry about it, it's fine. It's embarrassing. It's fine. My bus stop is nearby. -How about you? -That way. Give me your hand. Your hand! In case you want to take a risk, or invest. You were right. It's risky. I met a girl. She's fun to be with. Hey, I'm listening! I'm sorry. My phone signal is weak. Stop pretending! I'm waiting for a message from the hospital. Let's go. How can you ever get a heart transplant when last night, you kept on saying, You're overacting! -I'm not. You're such a flirt. -Come on, a car might hit you. Flirt! Ali, you can't expect your Mr. Nick to text you right away, OK? What? After you go on a date, you can't message someone right away. So, when was the last time you had sex? Fool. Come on, can't you take a joke? -But is the three-day rule really a thing? -Of course! But for me, it only takes two days. I'm pretty, you know. Do your grandparents know I'm chaperoning you? You want to go out on a date with her? I'm done with that. You're done? You're just too shy to make the first move. Like I told you, I'm done with those things. -Ali! -Do you remember me? You didn't call me. Oh, yeah. It washed off. Who were you talking to? My friend. He's a doctor in this hospital? You never mentioned you had a friend working in this hospital. Nick, would it be possible… for you to move me up on the waiting list? Just kidding. I know there's nothing you can do to help me. Oh, you were joking? I just want to spend time with you again. Was that really a joke? Yes, but I'm not joking about wanting to spend time with you again. Is that OK? Of course. It's really OK with you? Yes, of course. Let's go. This is where I go whenever I want to escape. Smile! I used to do this before. For events like weddings. When I still could. But what I really want to be is… What? You think I'm joking? I'm not. I placed second in a contest. Before, that was only in my "just because" list. What's in that "just because" list of yours? It's just a list of reasons why I should fight for my life. -Do you want to see it? -Sure. -OK, just listen to me. -All right. It's interesting. I bet you'll like it. "Because sisig is delicious." -Admit it, that's true. -OK. "Bungee jumping at the Grand Canyon. Because I still want to see the Berlin Wall." I want to take a lot of photos there. This one, I really like this. "To sing three songs continuously without losing my breath. To be serenaded by the person I love. To go to Donsol and swim with the sharks. To take Mama back to the Philippines. To love again. To not get my heart broken again." -Wow. -You can do it. That's it. Everything you just said is possible. You can do all of that. Really? And based on my assessment of you, it won't stop chasing whatever it wants. Right? Let's go. Pose. So, here it is. Here's my stop. Thank you for bringing me home. Thank you, too. I really enjoyed spending time with you today. I know. It's because you spent your day with me. Wow. That's what I've been telling you. -It's like you never knew me. -Allison. You're getting used to coming home late. This is my brother, Seb. The food's going to be delicious. Come on inside, let's eat. You can't say no to food. That's right! OK, we'll follow in a bit. Maybe it's a sign that this beautiful day isn't going to end yet. Right? Let's go. Come here. Just a heads-up. You said you hadn't been back to the Philippines in ten years, right? This is delicious! I brought a guest with me. He's Nick, my friend. Come on in. This is Aunt Martha. Here, Nick. And here are my cousins, Sam and Kevin, and Sam's cute kids, Koko and Emily. -Where's Mama? -How about some-- Here. -I'm right here. -Mom, this is my friend, Nick. Good evening, ma'am. Come on, I'll give you a juice. Let's put this here. Here, take a seat. -Food looks delicious. -Yes, it really is. -Let's eat. -Let's eat, OK. OK, it is yours. Delicious. Finally, I was able to put them to sleep. At long last. -They're too hyper. -Sorry, they're really that playful. -You don't need to tell me. -Sorry, Nick. Auntie Martha, your food's very delicious. I'm glad you liked it. I'm sorry, I keep forgetting names. Don't worry, it's perfectly fine. I forget their names, too, -even though they are my relatives. -Her own daughter. Even though we're living under one roof. But you, I will never forget. You want to know why? Because… it's rare for Ali to have guests. -That's not true. -It is true, and a guy! Who's also good-looking. Wait a minute. When we were still in Ontario, I always held house parties. -Right, Mom? -I don't remember anything like that. She was such a drunkard! Speaking of, do you want more wine? Thank you, though. I realized it's been a while since I've had dinner with Filipinos. I don't have to think so hard, speaking. You know, speaking in English. Here, I don't have to worry too much. How old are you? I just want to know how old he is. No, it's cool. I'm 45 years old. So, what's your job? -How do I say it? -Go ahead. You could say that I'm a businessman. What do you sell? Having a business here is difficult for migrants like us. Well… Well, now, I should say that because I sold all my shares already. Not exactly, because I believe I'm still too young to retire. Too young. -Take the wine away from Mama. -Give me that. Sorry. I'm really sorry. You've been drinking too much. I could really feel the tension back there. I'm really sorry. My mom's just being overprotective. I think she forgets that we're old enough to take care of ourselves. And sorry about how Seb behaves. Thank you very much. And… tonight was really fun. This whole day was fun. Thank you. And thank you because I met you. Take it easy. My heart might get shocked again. Tell that heart of yours that I will take care of it. -Really? -Really. Wrong. -Take care. -OK. And nothing can stop it. Hey. These are new, right? It's the one you told me to take a photo of, right? Let's do this another time. We can do this. For the photo. -Come on! -Ali. -Come on, Nick, let's go! -Ali. Ali, it's dangerous. Ali. -It's not safe! -You're more scared than I am. Come on! -Let's go! Hurry! -I said it's dangerous. -Come on! It's not that scary. -Stop! Don't move too much, the bridge might flip, Ali! Stop! Come on, look! It's really not that scary. -No! -See? Let's go! Why are you so hardheaded? We can do anything as long as we're together, right? Really, Ali? Lynn Canyon? Do you know how hard it is for paramedics to get there? And it's so far from the hospital. Was it Nick who invited you there? No. I was the one who invited him. Good Lord, I don't know what you've been up to and what you've been keeping from me. -Mother, that's enough. -Relax, Mom. Your blood pressure is rising, we should have Sam check it. Do you think this is all a joke? I'm sorry, Mom. I was just trying to lighten the mood. You're being so disrespectful. Ali, I want to support you. So, if I die because of the crazy things I've been doing, then at least I get to say Don't you dare say that. Take it back. When your father died, I thought that was the most painful thing that could happen in my life. But I was able to get through it because you and Seb were there. You didn't leave me alone. But, Ali, I don't think I can bury my own child. Simon, girls like Arianne… They don't like guys who beat around the bush. Go straight to the point. The important thing is, you have to ask her. Right? Carpe diem! -Sorry! -You surprised me, Nick. Did we make plans today? No. What's that? -For real? -Corny. That's so sweet! I didn't know serenading was still a thing. That's cool, you know? See? You want that? Take it! If singing to her doesn't work, Only if you feel like going. Unless you don't want to, but… Unless you're not free. What? Your bookshop is so beautiful. Simon isn't my son. It's a good thing he's not mad at you. He was still too young back then. Maybe he didn't know what was happening. To him, his mom was in Qatar to provide a future for them. If only he knew that I fucked up his family. Let's send her home. No. She's still mad at me. Let's find a way. How can we contact her? Don't bother. It's too hard. Besides, I don't want to interfere anymore. I'm going to chaperone Simon to his dance. And if you don't have anything to do, and if no one has invited you out yet, You're cute! I already said yes earlier. I was just testing you to see if you remembered. You asked me before what my dream was. I wasn't able to give you an answer. But when I was a kid, as hard as it is to admit, this was my dream. To become an astronaut. For real? -Really? -Really. Why do you find it embarrassing? It's actually cool. It's cool. Because it seemed to be an impossible dream. But when I was young, it was crazy at home. People were always arguing. I was bullied in school. So, I said: I'll just completely disappear from this world. No one will notice. No one will miss me. Alone. Just observing the world. You're just observing the rest of the world. Then, you wait… for the things you hate to disappear from the world. That was my dream before. If your dream to become an astronaut had come true, do you think you'd have been able to solve the mysteries of the universe? I wonder what it is about your eyes that whisper to me: It's as if I have nothing else to worry about. My world is spinning out of control. the world stops, time stops. I didn't expect that any of this would happen to me, -that I'd reach this point-- -Nick. I still have something to say to you. Jerk. Dude, are you immortal? How many lives have you got? What happened? You just need to de-stress, lessen your activities… She's the one who brought you here, but I haven't seen her. You disappeared. You're still alive. The doctor says it's a miracle. I have a tumor here. It's been there for a while. I had surgery, but after a few years, it came back. It's in a sensitive part of the brain, so… it's too risky to have it removed. You know, I'm lucky because my tumor is over here. That's why I still get to walk and I'm not paralyzed. I can still talk. I'm talkative, aren't I? I often get headaches and feel dizzy. You've already noticed that. But I still tried to hide it from you. I didn't want you to get worried. Why, Nick? You're already going through a lot. Exactly, I'm also going through that. I know the feeling. When you sleep at night not knowing if you're going to wake up the following day. I know more nurses and doctors than I know friends. And… I get more injections than a drug addict. I have a scar on my chest and a device that keeps my heart beating. We could have overcome this together. But you did help me, Ali. Before I met you, I had already given up. I was just finishing what I had to finish. Take care of those who need you the most. Forget about me. I can take care of myself. If you want to, It's been five years already. Besides, you're here. What's your plan for Ali? YOLO, remember? Why don't you ask me Who I really love? Why don't you ask me? I'll tell you right away You are the one I love It's your love that I truly need A love that's everlasting And that's how I truly feel My heart tells me one thing You are the one I love I hope you believe in me There's no one else but you You are the one I love It's your love that I truly need A love that's everlasting And that's how I truly feel Are you still mad at me? You really are sick because you're so corny. So, you're not mad anymore? That was just a lovers' quarrel. It wasn't serious. And how can I stay mad at you? You know, even if my days are numbered, I love you, Allison Castillo. I don't want to hear any of it! I just want to make it up to your son. In case you've forgotten, you ruined our family. Do you think you can fix that? I really regret what happened. Do it for the kid, please. It's not that easy for your mom. I already accepted that. Simon, you're still too young. -Believe me. -Young? Let him be. What I went through when my father left us is also what Simon is going through right now because of me. And I regret that every day. He didn't do anything wrong. You're still there for him. -But what if--? -Don't. Just don't leave him, Nick. No goodbyes, OK? Ali, pick up your phone. Ali, your phone is ringing. Ali. Seb, come on. Hurry! Let's get ready. -This is it! -This is it? This is it! We're still waiting for the heart to arrive. Finally, I got lucky! Good evening, ma'am. -They're picking up my heart now. -OK. I'm nervous. Thank you for being there for her. Please don't leave her. Thank you very much. Thank you. Bye, Seb. What is this? What's this? Like you. Remember when you said you wanted to meet people like you? Someday, you'll be able to fulfill all your dreams. You know, I've thought about it. That was like a sneak peek of things to come. At least I know that it's possible. It's possible for me to get a call, it's possible for me to move up on the waiting list, and it's possible for me to get better. Anything! Anything is possible. It's the same for you. Nick, it's possible. Come on. Let's find a cure for your tumor. You know, it's a hopeless case. Only God can heal me now. Then let's pray. Let's go visit the pope. Let's make an offering. A goat perhaps? Anything! Nick, we need to believe. We need to fight. But I'm the reason he did it. I've always hated parents who turned their backs on their children. Grandpa and Grandma are probably waiting for me. I won't make it to your homecoming, That's why I thought of teaching you this. It's important for you to learn this. That's a rite of passage to manhood. If you're able to do this, Has your date to the dance said yes? Has she said yes already? Not yet. But I think she will. Whenever I need to be sure I remember something, because I easily forget, I use this. I record everything here. I used to have this favorite ice cream place, and I forgot about it. I was able to record the location here. That's it, it's nothing. Take me there next time, OK? Sure! What if there's no next time? Let's not talk about last sunsets yet, OK? We still have a long day ahead of us. Here we go again, Nick. What else? What else are you hiding from me? Now you're giving me your heart? Are you kidding me? That was planned a long time ago. I got the list from Frank to meet my matches, and… How wonderful! You assessed everything already? You figured it all out! You planned it all out! What about me? When were you going to ask me? Don't I have a say in this, Nick? While I'm looking for ways for you to live, you'd rather die and leave me? Fine! Let's just die together! Come on, let's plan it! Would you want us to plan how we'll die together? Can't you understand? I'd rather die if it means saving you It's like killing me as well, Nick! Nick, I can wait for another heart! It's your life that's on the line! Please keep fighting because that's what I'm doing! Nick, I love you. -I was supposed to go to you. -The odds aren't with us. -I was wrong, I should be understanding-- -But I'll fight for it. And now I understand the risks. I know it's tough and risky-- I signed the papers. Not because you wanted me to, but because I want to bet on this. I want to believe in and hope for a happy ending. Yeah. I believe there is a future. That I'll be with you for the rest of my life. I think we're overdressed. That's OK. I was told that I was going to die. Could it get any worse? You returned. I received a postcard. Carpe diem, right? I couldn't say no to my son. Thank you, Nick. Even though I wasn't around. Even though his dad is no longer around. It suits you. Have I told you… that I wanted to be an astronaut? Of all the things I've done… I became a boatman, caregiver, venture capitalist, and… You said you wanted to ask me for a dance. Where am I? I'm just here. Promise me you won't forget me. Got discharged today. This is a record-breaker. I only spent two days in the hospital. Why don't you ask me Who I really love? -You are the one I love -I love Because of her, I am reminded that I can die anytime. This rebellious lady. Tomorrow, my life could already be hers. We were together yesterday. We did nothing but laugh. Keep going. When I first met her, She said it was destiny, even if the purpose was unknown. And our story will never end. don't forget to bring your house key. Ali. This isn't the end yet. Mr. Gutierrez, I've been waiting for you for a long time. This isn't the end? No! So, what's in our "just because" list today? Let me think. Whatever. I don't care as long as I'm with you. Based on my assessment of your heart, I promise I'll be with you every step of the way. You'll stick around? I'll stick around. I'm always here. That's a promise.
