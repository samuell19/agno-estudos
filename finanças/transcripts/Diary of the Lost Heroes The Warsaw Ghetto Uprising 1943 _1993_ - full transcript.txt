(dramatic music) - [Narrator] Between the 19th April and the 16th May 1943 an heroic uprising took place in the Ghetto of Warsaw. From the windows of the ghetto about 500 young Jews fought a desperate battle against an overwhelmingly superior German force, only a few of these heroes survived. Today six of them tell their story. Masha Putermilch, Simcha Rotem, Pnina Grynszpan, Aheron Carmi, Hella Rufeisen, and Marek Edalman. (Bomb explodes) (dramatic music) On September 1st 1939 the German army attacked Poland, 3.5 million Jews fell into the hands of Hitler, the Second world War was about to begin, Warsaw was heavily bombed, and after it was captured, Hitler himself came to celebrate the victory. - I saw the powerful army enter the city, on horseback, in tanks, marching along with steel helmets on their heads. It made an enormous impression on me. I didn't know why, I couldn't explain it, but I knew that something overwhelming was going to happen. (dramatic music) (somber music) - This is a piece of the wall, there was a wall like this running for about six miles around the Ghetto. This is the last piece of wall still remaining, probably it survives simply because it had to serve as a division between two streets, no one actually knows why it still survives, no one paid any attention to it. It's just here that there were small holes through which the children clambered to the outside to get a few potatoes, and some food for their parents. But that wall was a barrier between two worlds, here was the Ghetto and there was the world outside. There you could run around, and here you couldn't. Here people died of hunger, and there people just survived. In those days the top of the wall was made of cement, with broken glass in it, so that you couldn't climb over it. There were two different worlds, here there was a world of hunger which was a death sentence. There, there was a world of misery, but at least people survived. - [Narrator] 380,000 Jews were packed into an area of less that one and a half square miles, where they lived in terrible conditions. Later this number would increase to half a million, as the Germans forces Jews from other parts of Poland into the Ghetto to facilitate the Final Solution. On the 15th November 1940 they closed all 22 entrances to the Ghetto. - Then the Warsaw Ghetto was sealed off, people suffered all kinds of privations, there was no more food, all the supplies were used up. People could no longer find a job, the situation became very bad. - It became very crowded and oppressive, there was no space for all those people, various help centers were set up, former schools were used for this purpose, then all the children who had nowhere else to live were brought together here. They slept on the ground, and they were forced to go and beg for bread in order to survive. (dramatic music) (somber music) - We are standing on the precise spot, where on the 22nd July 1942 the deportation of the Jews from Warsaw started. The cobblestones are still here in front of the wall, the same cobblestones over which more than 350,000 Jews walked on their way to the extermination camps, to Treblinka, to Auschwitz, to Majdanek, to Trawniki. All those people died. Here the German SS troops forced all those people into the cattle wagons at gun point. Sometimes there were more people to deport then there was space in the wagons. Between eight and ten thousand people could be transported by train each day. Sometimes too many people were rounded up, and the people left behind remained in this building here, up there. Before the war it was a school, after the deportations it stood completely empty. People spent the night in this building, on the floor, in the attic, in the cellars, until the next morning when new wagons came, and they were then taken away. (train door sliding shut) [Narrator] Heler Rufthasen witnessed the final moments of the uprising from the Supreme Command bunker at Mila 18. She'd come to the Ghetto as a 21 year old member of the Zionist youth movement, Akheeva, and from here she watched the mass deportations to Treblinka. It was terrible, really terrible. One day I went from the large Ghetto to the small Ghetto over the bridge. The Jews were asking one another, "Where's it going to happen, in the large Ghetto, or in the small Ghetto?" Some people dragged their possessions to one side, and others to the other side. - [Narrator] Masha Putermilch was actively engaged in the uprising from the beginning. At the age of 16 she was already participating in the resistance activities of the Bund, a Jewish Socialist Workers party. - We distributed illegal news sheets, and I personally put up posters, which contained the words, "Jews don't let yourselves be taken away. It's not true that the Germans want to move you to Poniatowa, and Trawniki. You're going to certain death." Simcha Rotem, also known as Kazik, saved 34 Jews from the burning Ghetto towards the end of the uprising. At 17, he took part in various secret operations of the Zionist Youth Organization, Hashomer Hatzair. - We published illegal news sheets in the Ghetto. We tried to explain to the people that the removal of the Jews from the Ghetto meant death. The people didn't believe it. (somber music) - [Narrator] Marek Edelman was one of the commanders of the uprising, Mordechai Anielewicz was the supreme commander, Edelman had, at the age of 19, an important position within the Bund. - We knew at an early stage that Jews were being murdered in Belzec and other concentration camps. In vehicles into which exhaust gases or poison gas was pumped. We knew that they were murdered in this way, but still no one would believe us. People don't believe such things. - [Narrator] 22 year old Aheron Carmi came to Warsaw in January 1943 from the Ghetto of Aphochno where he was a member of the Zionist youth movement Gordonya - Via messenger we received at that time a resistance newsletter in the city, from the youth movement Ghordonya. It contained the first reports about what was happening in Posna and Lublin. It became clear to us from these reports what went on in Treblinka. - [Narrator] Prina Grynszpan of the Marek Edelman group came to Warsaw in 1939 when she was 17 years old. A member of the Jewish Socialist Party, Poale Zion, she understood what would happen to the Jews. - We all knew what was going in Auschwitz and Mydonic, where the Germans were sending us in order to kill us. In order to incinerate us. Everyone knew that you had nothing to lose. If you were going to be incinerated there, it was better to try to save yourself by offering resistance. (Dramatic music) (somber music) - [Narrator] The various underground youth organizations were powerless during the deportations in the summer of 1942. They had hardly any weapons, and were force to witness the murder on the spot of 3/4 of the Jews in the Ghetto. On July 28th that year, a number of organizations united and formed the Jewish fighting unit, known as the ZOB. In October more groups joined. - The organization was set up on the 15th October, formed out of many youth organizations. No one was older than 24, they all joined up irrespective of their political conviction. They decided to fight against what was happening, and what would happen when the coming deportations took place. By then there were only between 60 and 80,000 people left in the Ghetto. Those young people decided to show that the world was the same here among the Jews, as everywhere else in the world. - It was a disaster, we sensed that it would end in disaster but we had to do something. - Fighting groups were formed, we were unarmed but we slowly began to assemble weapons. We had contacts on the outside, with the bolder Polish resistance organizations who supplied some weapons to the Ghetto. And so the first armed action took place in January when the Germans came to liquidate the Ghetto. (dramatic music) (somber music) - The assembly point wasn't used for some months, not until January when the Germans decided to liquidate the Ghetto. Then they began to round people up here, not in great numbers anymore because people were already going into hiding. They succeeded in rounding up 6,000 people here within three days, and taking them away. But after three or four days, they stopped the deportations because then the Jewish Fighting Organization had come into action for the first time. The first Germans were killed, they hadn't expected any resistance. It was as a result of this resistance that they stopped the deportations. - I succeeded in killing a few Germans and capturing their weapons. So after three days the Germans decided to suspend the deportations. - [Narrator] On January 18th Oberfuhrer von Sammern-Frankenegg, Commander of the SS and police of the Warsaw District planned to restart the deportations. After the totally unexpected resistance, he decided to withdraw his troops. Fearing a repetition of the event of January 18th, the Germans temporarily postponed the final extermination. The Jews realized that resistance was possible, this knowledge would be decisive for the further preparation of the battle. - I arrived in the Ghetto on the 21st January 1943. I let it be known that I wanted to contact, Eliezer Geller. We sat talking to one another for half the night, and then he produced a gun. It was a P38 semi-automatic, a German pistol. He shook my hand and said, "From now on, you're a member of the Jewish Fighting Organization." - New fighting groups were formed from the people who remained after January. A total of 220 young people, young men and also young women, each group consistent of 10 or 12 people in one safe address. There they practiced with their weapons and learnt to shoot. - We were all young, we had no idea of how to use a pistol or a rifle. What were we supposed to do with it? We couldn't learn to shoot in actual practice, we learned on a piece of cardboard, with a target drawn on it. We were just playing, we thought that we could learn to shoot like that. We'd received a small quantity of arms from the Polish underground, very small quantity, three dozens pistols and grenades, perhaps one or two rifles. We bought them from various people on the outside. - One of the biggest problems was how to get weapons. I was given a 7 mm pistol, an FN, I always carried that pistol with me until the liberation. I was liberated with the FN on me, I always had it with me, it gave me a feeling of self-confidence, that I wouldn't fall into the hands of the Germans still alive. I wanted to be in a position to offer resistance, and I wanted to be in a position to commit suicide with the last bullet. - The Ghetto was divided into three parts, in the whole Ghetto there were 22 groups which fought. Eight groups were in the area around the Tobbens Schulz Factory. There were nine groups in the central Ghetto, and five groups in the Burstenmacher area. The 22 groups consisted of about 12 to 15 people each. Everyone had a pistol, two grenades, and a little ammunition. - [Narrator] The supreme commander of the 22 fighting groups was 24 year old Mordechi Anyelavich, he would not survive the uprising. - The secrecy was so great, that one group was not allowed to know anything of the existence of the others. When I arrived they put me in Marek Edelman's group, it was our task to make incendiary bombs, and molotov cocktails. - We made grenades ourselves, we made explosives ourselves, we made mines, and all the kinds of things that you prepare in order to defend yourselves. - We arrived in Turbance and received various assignments. First we had to establish lines of communication, so that we could move from one house to the other, without encountering the Germans in the street. The houses were not free standing, the buildings were joined together, so the walls between the attics were broken down, and gaps were opened up between the houses, so that you could move from number one to number three, to number five, to number seven and so on. The whole plan was to make passages through the Ghetto. - [Narrator] While the fighters prepared themselves for the final battle, the rest of the inhabitants were building bunkers day and night, in cellars and in attics to provide shelter in the event of a final German attack. In April a rumor circulated that the Germans would enter the Ghetto at any moment, nevertheless on April 18th the Jews prepared to celebrate the Passover. The Nazis meanwhile had selected that Holy Day for their attack. (dramatic music) - In our group it was arranged that we would keep watch the whole night, we each took turns, one by one, we stood at the window to watch for the beginning of the uprising. We were ready for it, but we didn't know on what day it would take place. That night, I kept watch. - We knew that the Ghetto would be liquidated very shortly, but we didn't know exactly when it would happen. During that whole period between January and April it was clear to us that it could happen at any moment. (dramatic music) - We all slept in our clothes, we were very tense, then I saw something was going to happen, there was activity on the streets. Vehicles were driving about, everyone was woken up, I woke up our commander, and the commander woke up all our fellow fighters. We immediately decided to move to our agreed positions. They were one floor below, one apartment had several rooms, we needed five windows, there were 10 of us, so there were two people at each window. We went down to the floor below, then we waited for the agreed signal, this was the group opposite us throwing a grenade. The time seemed endless, the waiting made us extremely tense. - At the time I was in turbulence, on the night of the 18th they surrounded the whole Ghetto we were keeping watch up in the attics. We watched them drive round the wall in their vehicles. They were dropping off three people every 20 yards, those people stayed in that position, and the vehicle moved on. That information was immediately passed on to the commander. He declared a state of emergency. He called together all the fighters who were at home, and said, "Everyone must stay here, can no longer leave." (boots slapping) - We saw the Germans march in very cheerful, and tremendously self-confident. We let them come closer to us, then the first grenade was thrown by the group opposite, apart from that group there was one other group. There were three groups of us in that part of the Ghetto, then, it's very difficult to recall that moment again, there was such chaos from our grenades, and the Molotov cocktails, and the shots we fired. I remember firing shots for the first time in my life. (gun bangs) (grenade explodes) - I heard shots being fired about 10 streets away, both by the Germans and by us. I could tell exactly which shots were fired by them, and which by us. - I heard shots, we realized something was going on. We still had telephone contact with the other parts of the Ghetto. We knew that it had started. Of course each of us took up the position, which had been agreed in advance, that was where each of us should stand, and what each of us had to do when the time came. We waited until the Germans entered our area. - I can't remember how long we held our position, but we had a more favorable position than the Germans. We had the wall below the window, we threw grenades and the molotov cocktails onto them down below, but when they fired back we hid below the window, then they couldn't hit us. That was the advantage we had. Then the heavy firing with mortars began, so that our whole room caught fire, we couldn't see anything. We didn't know how to keep going. I can't remember how long it lasted. It seemed to us an eternity. Then the Germans withdrew with their rifles held over their heads. I saw that, the rifles held high up, they withdrew along the wall, and lowered themselves down, covered in blood, wounded, dead. I couldn't get a clear picture of it all, we didn't stand up to look, but later we saw German blood. - When the first shots were fired in the Ghetto in the morning about 7 o'clock, the Germans withdrew, the commander was then replaced and tanks were employed, heavy artillery was bought up, about midday another attack on the Ghetto began, then there was fighting in the streets, Nalewski street, Zamenhof street, but that's not important for the viewer of today who is not familiar with the streets, and who doesn't know what the general situation was, and whether 17 or two shots were fired. An important thing is the resistance lasted the whole day, and the Germans didn't succeed in occupying a single house. (Gun shots) - [Narrator] Once again the Germans were surprised by the resistance that took place from the windows. During the setbacks of April 19th their command was taken over by Yurgen Stroop, who was experienced in operations against civilian populations. Stroop decided to enter all sections of the Ghetto next day with more than 2000 men of the SS, Wehrmacht and police. (dramatic music) - At half past nine the convoy of Germans arrived, with ammunition and weapons. They were armed to the teeth as if they were going to the Russian front. As if they were going to fight against an army. Who were they going to fight against, against a few young men and women, armed with pistols. Eliezer Geller took two grenades, he pulled out the pin of the first grenade with his teeth, and the pin of the second with his hand, then he threw them quickly one after the other, right in the middle of the Germans who were coming from the other side. - We fought the whole battle from the windows, we weren't fighting face to face. Even the Germans admired the courage of the young women who fought. You expect it from young men, but the young women were also throwing grenades. - The Germans saw a woman up on the third or fourth floor, they were so amazed that they stood still for a moment, they screamed at one another, "Look, look Hans, up there, a woman." - Everyone had to do what he could, it made no difference whether you killed one German or 10. You had to kill someone, you had to offer resistance. You just had to remember one thing, to save the last bullet for yourself. - I only joined in the fighting on the second day when the Germans entered my area. A mine exploded, one we had put there earlier, a few Germans were killed by it. The battle continued in the courtyards for a few hours. The Germans asked for a ceasefire, that kind of ridiculous thing happened. Then they set fire to the whole area, and everyone had to leave their home, and go to the central Ghetto where they hadn't started any fires. You shouldn't see the uprising as a large military force, you should see it as a pure event, virtually defenseless people fought against a large army in order to show that they were people, no less than the Germans were. (dramatic music) - The Germans came in on the 22nd with Lithuanians and Ukrainians. They went from door to door but didn't go inside. They just went from door to door. They shouted to the Jews that they had to assemble outside. There was a man called Shimon Heller there, in a Nowodworski group, he came along with us. He had a rifle. We had carbines, but he was the only one to have a rifle. We found out where the Germans were, we gave him a sign, he was standing in position beside the window and took very careful aim in order to be sure that every shot would mean a dead German. When the Germans saw that first one of the them had been hit, then a second and a third, they though that there were many rifles, but there was only one rifle. It was passed from one house to another, and each time it was fired. (dramatic music) On the 23rd the artillery was brought into action. - They set the houses on fire, they had flame throwers, they set fire to houses from the outside, some people ran away, others died in the flames, or leapt from the balconies. Some survived, others died in the streets, that's how it was. - Threatened by the flames people jumped out of the window without knowing how high it was, they jumped anyway. Even the chance to take their own lives in this way was denied them. Many were shot as they jumped. - At the end of April Lutek Rotblat and Tosia Altman fetched us from our burning house on Muranowska 24, and took us to the bunker at Mila 18. We walked along the flame lit streets, you heard the glass falling out of the windows, you saw smoke but I saw no people in the streets. Everyone was in the bunkers, or in the burning houses. We were taken to the reinforced concrete bunker, after that difficult day in the burning house everyone who had suffered a shock of that kind was always taken there first, because conditions were better there. (somber music) - Where we are now standing was the bunker of the supreme commander of the Jewish Fighting Organization from here orders went out to the various fighting groups, what had to be done today, where an action will be carried out today, and where tomorrow, and which groups will fight, and which will stay in reserve. They were all young people, and young people are always active. That vitality and their conviction that they're the same as all other people gave them the strength to fight against the colossal machine of the German army, which wanted to exterminate the population of the Warsaw Ghetto. That was the crux of the matter. (dramatic music) - By the 24th we were hungry, we had nothing to eat. We didn't have enough ammunition, we were now short of everything. - During the day we did absolutely nothing, at about six, seven, or eight in the evening, people reported to the rendez vous, not all at the same time, they reported there to receive instructions on what to do. - At night we left the bunker and tried to shoot the Germans on guard duty. That's what we did. (dramatic music) - It was the last day that the people who were in the bunkers held out. They dragged one another outside, but some stayed in the bunker. Those who came outside were taken to Leshno 88, and from there transported on, and those who stayed braved it out until the very last moment. But the Germans found all those bunkers, they had listening equipment and found them, they took everyone inside away, they transported them to Treblinka, to Auschwitz, to Majdanek, and they all died. (dramatic music) - Then the leaders of the fighting organization decided that there was absolutely no point in waiting for death in the Ghetto. (somber music) - [Narrator] On April 29th a staff meeting took place at the Jewish Supreme Command bunker at Mila 18, the decision was made to explore every possibility of escape from the Ghetto. A few fighters had already succeeded in this, some from the Turbel Shultz area had made their way out through the sewers. - We left the bunkers on the 29th at 2 o'clock in the morning, there should have been a lorry to pick us up, but it wasn't there. They hadn't succeeded in arranging it, we remained in the Ghetto, we all went into an attic, we spent the whole of the 29th there, all 14 of us were lying there with rifles, but almost out of ammunition, waiting for a lorry. (dramatic music) (somber music) - [Narrator] Aheron Carmi's unit with the help of fighters from outside the Ghetto eventually reached a nearby forest, Simcha Rotem and a comrade were sent out to plan the escape of the remaining Jews. After a few days those left inside dared wait no longer, and some were sent into the sewers. - They were people who must have worked in the sewers, and who knew their way around them. We were walking in a tunnel and suddenly heard a loud bang, we stopped and didn't move. Nothing happened, so we shuffled on again through the water, I don't know for how long, one hour, two hours, three hours, but it was a long time. (dramatic music) (somber music) - The tunnels had various exits which were hidden, almost all the exits were discovered by the Germans, they had special listening equipment, they placed it on the ruins which were here, if they heard a sound somewhere they drilled holes, and pumped poison gas inside. When they discovered their bunker they pumped gas inside through six holes, then the fighters began to commit mass suicide. No one wanted to get out and fall into German hands still alive. This is where the nucleus of the Jewish fighting organization died, they committed suicide. Only a handful managed to escape, they found an unguarded exit, but very few got out of here. Some who did get to the outside died shortly afterwards because they'd already been poisoned by the gas. In fact you can say the day on which the largest group of the Jewish Fighting Organization died marked the end of the uprising. It continued for about another ten days, but only isolated groups were left fighting. A few managed to escape from the Ghetto through the sewers. There were only two fighting groups left in the Ghetto, there was no further contact with them. - I returned to the Ghetto on the 8th May, everything had been raised to the ground. Not a single house was left standing. I didn't walk, I crawled on my stomach, through the rubble. I went to places where I knew fighters had been when I left. - Kazic looked for us but couldn't find us, so ten of us were sent in a group to the sewer tunnel, and there we met up with him. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] On the 9th May groups of fighters were waiting in the sewers for a signal from Kazic who was planning the last details of the escape. - When I walked away a bit from the main exit Shlomo Alterman came after me and said, "Come on, don't stand still, otherwise we'll be too late." But I said, "I'm not going." I was completely exhausted, I was demoralized, I couldn't care less anymore. Then he began to drag me, and he said, "You must come, we must get out of here." He was in the same group as Kazic, he dragged me back again to the main exit, we were standing there, and while we were standing there, a note from Kazic fluttered down, it said, "Keep your spirits up, we're coming to get you out." That really encouraged us, because we knew there was someone above who would get us out. We all supported one another. (dramatic music) (somber music) - [Narrator] On the 10th May Kazic succeeded in getting 34 people out through the sewer. - For a week, or about 10 days you still heard shots behind the wall. In fact it was already quiet here by about 16th, 17th May. There was nobody left in the Ghetto, houses were destroyed and set on fire. Those houses still standing were blown up. There was an enormous pile of rubble lying here, up to the first floor, bricks everywhere. Here there were buildings, houses, streets, courtyards. Here thousands of people lived, now nothing remains, everything has been destroyed. (somber music)
