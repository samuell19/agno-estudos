I want to go all the way to that place - - where even those with the biggest dreams don't go. A place they can't even dream of. If I start telling people about what I really want - - people will think I'm crazy. It all started with a YouTube video and a lot of hype - - turning into sold-out concerts and the release of an album. When the decade began, Lukas Graham were practically unknown - - as was their lead singer, Lukas Forchhammer. Many have sung along to Lukas Graham's 'Drunk in the Morning'. Anybody here love Lukas Graham? We're rolling. Everybody, get the fuck inside! This is Lukas Graham, from Copenhagen, Christiania. A lot of Danes have become huge fans. Will you stick to Denmark, or would you go to LA some day? I don't sing in Danish. So it's an option. Lukas Graham! God damn... They asked us, "What do you want? We'll give it to you." We can work with whomever we want. They have 200 employees, so whether we want 4, 6, 8 or 10... It depends on how many departments we want involved. We might become the greatest if we do it right. If we pick the right team. But we have a couple of more meetings with labels. Why? I don't know. We've signed a record deal with Warner Music. We're gonna play with the big boys. What's up? Nice day? There's a heavy smell of weed here, huh? - There was just one left. - What's up? We've had a meeting. With Cameron Strang. He signed Kings of Leon and Bruno Mars independently. His assistant starts out by asking, "What do you want?" And I said, "We want time. To finish the record properly.” It's not some indie label belonging to a bigger one. It's the big boys with the big guns saying, "We want them." - Awesome. - That's exciting. - It's incredible. - Right now, the world is our oyster. It's a bit difficult to grasp the meaning of all of this. - Isn't it great? - Yes. We're here to make the album of our lives. Once you conquer the US, the world is yours. Turn it up. - You guys are really, like, organic. - Yeah. Really. So how far would you go as far as weird sounds and stuff? We wanna just sound fresh. It shouldn't sound old, you know? I'm eating. Come on, I just had one verse. I thought you were gonna say: Right. Something like that. If you can hit that exact note! Why do we always end up recording lines that are so difficult to sing live? - You start it yourself every time. - You guys choose the chords, fuckers! Good point, although you did choose to change that melody to something - - that no human really normally sings. So it is a little bit your fault. I spent 17 years practicing to sing that high. But my point is, milking it becomes too much. So change it up. I like that. - Cool, huh? - Yeah. - This is like... - That's easy. - Hey, I love that you say that. - I think it's cool. You can do anytime a melody on it and you can do like... We haven't played it for Lukas yet. So, let's listen to what we did yesterday. Are you ready? Let's go. So that's all? That's it? He can pause it now. Cool beat... Disappointing. I thought there was a track. - That's what I was told. - No, it's just a beat. For me, it's just... If everything's the same, it's kind of dull. - It's not inspiring? - No. - We can write it on the piano, too. - Right. I think that beat is dope. I dunno. I think Lukas expected there to be more... Like a finished track. I'm mad at this place because we don't make any music here. For me at least. I haven't been able to contribute. - I don't have anything to work with. - No. In that sense, I think it's better to go with a: "Hey ho she wants some." And try to do something where we have a song. You are the man, you know. Don't doubt that! No one writes better than you, not even over here. Maybe that's the issue. That our label doesn't get us. The songs aren't bad, but we can't finish the productions. Then let's write 15 songs and talk to the producers afterwards. Four lines. That's what we got out of a nine hour studio session. If I tell Stefan to play some chords, he says, "What if I play them like this?" And then Rissi goes, "What about like this?" And then we realize the first idea was shit, but it seemed good at the time. I need someone to shoot me down. If no one does, things won't improve. I rarely feel stressed and I rarely get excited. If you get stressed, you'll break, and if you get excited, you get disappointed. This is crazy. I get the chance to do everything I ever wanted to - - meanwhile it's like living my worst nightmare, like an extra bonus. Then I see an old man with everything he owns inside of a trolley - - and I think, "What's the real goal? Is it to get rich and famous? Or to just have a home and some children who'll love you when you get old?" According to my parents, I was born an entertainer. I started as a 2-year-old in the "'The Crumbs' films. A smiling little boy, who speaks two languages but can't walk. I remember being "Grunk from "The Crumbs" as a child. Every time I tried to be a child with the other children, it was impossible - - because they had already boxed me in. That isolates you a bit. I think I spent 5 or 7 years without any friends my own age. If you don't have friends your age, you don't know how children behave. You start behaving like an adult. My dad was always my best friend. He was the one I shared everything with. Good music, good concerts... He may have pushed me more than my sisters. He knew I could take it. - That was a good one. - It wasn't the best singing you've done. It was a good performance, though. You need to protect yourself, and your voice. Think of all the concerts you're gonna have. "As I'm stumbling home, living with a man..." Maybe then it's like: "When I passed you by, you forgot to smile.” "Now we're sitting down for dinner, we got nothing to say." "It's like I'm watching you, slowly slipping away from me." Maybe something like, "we used to have the same wishes" kind of thing. "We used to be in agreement when we blew a wish.” "We used to have the same want to do something." I can't let you say the word "wish". You don't even seem superstitious. - No. - So you don't believe in wishes. Well, I believe in when you want something, you can get it. - Okay, that's different. - But the problem is, usually... You can only want one thing at a time - - so if you want your whole career to work out well - - then things are gonna be compromised by that. I believe that is true, but that's a whole different thing than wishing. Wishing's like... It's pretty close to praying. And you don't seem to be the type. But still, the kind of belief we put into what we're doing right now - - is the equivalent of religious belief. I agree. Okay, once more. "I don't know why..." Perfect. - Perfect, perfect, perfect. - I was trying to put the same words in. Our record label hasn't been good at telling us what they want. Everyone agrees there's plenty of good songs and a great artist - - but it's a typical problem that we've heard of before and feared. We're missing the first single. - See you tomorrow. - I'll give you a ride. - They're picking me up. - Can I walk you out? - If you want to. - Can I have five minutes? You'd better hurry. I'm in a bad mood. It annoys me that I don't get to play what matters to me. It fucks me up. People call me a diva or say that I suck or that I'm moody... These songs matter. It's the first love song we've ever written. - And the funeral song. - It's awesome. It's okay to be pissed off. Now cheer up. I'll fix it now. That's the list of all of the songs we've got right now. 'Ordinary Things' is too complicated. The US doesn't get it. I don't know... They don't get it. It has too many chords. He sings "such a jealous hoe." Never heard that before in an American song. They keep saying the first single is missing. For me, there's no difference from when we started in Denmark until now. Lukas doesn't give a fuck. He tells people that this is how he'll do it. That's easier. But you can't do that over here. Everything's bigger. There are 15 artists like Lukas out there. Can I say something? You might think I'm bullshitting, but I'm not. That's one of the best songs I've heard. That's one of the craziest records I've ever heard. - That's strong, right? - Strong? That's a copyright. - Do you know what that is? - Nah. A copyright is a song that lives forever. - It's like an evergreen? - It's like "Thriller'. I almost cried. That shit fucked me up. - That's a compliment, then. - No. That's one of the best songs I've ever heard in my life. Like seriously. And I've worked with everybody. That shit was fucking great. Crazy. Sometimes we're told that a song isn't a top 100 or a top 40. But I don't wanna be in the top 100 with a top 100 song. I wanna be in the top 100 with '7 Years'. Or 'Better Than Yourself'. I don't want to make Katy Perry pop. If they don't want to, they won't release my songs. I'll get sidetracked. No matter how big we become overseas, we have to thank Copenhagen and Denmark - - for giving us the opportunity to go to the US and say: "We'll do it our way. If that doesn't work, we don't mind going home." Thank you! For fuck's sake. What's going on? - Wow, huh? - That was crazy. Legendary. Are you coming back with us for a drink? I'll go meet the boys at "Byens Lys". All those famous people are having an after party. I'll go see my family. - Are you going to your place? - No, we're in Christiania. - Have a great night. Enjoy! - See you! Say hi to the guys! Warner didn't believe in '7 Years' as a single. '7 Years' was only released in Scandinavia and parts of Europe. Those territories alone pushed '7 Years' into the global top 50. It's god-damn crazy. Suddenly Warner Bros. In the US push this damn big button. You can feel that. - Basically it will show you... - 2.5 million monthly listeners? That's how many are actually listening to you in the last 28 days. It changes every day. The user interface has pushed Warner Bros. To release or open the tracks. That's great. The consumers are getting more power in the music industry, which is kinda cool. Everyone around the world is obsessed with you and your track right now. People are going crazy. Every market, they are all talking about this project. - So you have got supporters... - I hope it's the rest of the record too. 7 years later, I was just the '7 Years' guy. Stop it. Don't make up that movie in your head. Put that away. Lukas and the band, come on over. We want to present you guys with this, welcome you and thank you for coming. We're proud to have you here. Welcome to the WBR family! Bear with us. We know there's gonna be a lot of censorship on this song. And that really put talent back in the music. I haven't been this nervous for years. I'm sweating. I'm soaked. Let's keep the right tone. Magnus, you're pushing it. So this is how it feels to play your first sold-out show in America. God damn it, we're back! - We killed it! - Damn right we did. - I've never sung as well as today! - No, it's all incredible. A little bit of cold water! ...Is the best. Under the sea! How about all the merch selling out last night? Every single piece gone. Now it makes sense why we had to sign so many fucking T-shirts. - And drumsticks. - Do we sell drumsticks? I listened to the new album that is out here in the States. Your dad does play a big role on that. He comes up a lot. In '7 Years' you reference him, passing away at the age of 61. You've had quite a bit of success going on in Denmark and Europe for years. Now you're in the US, newfound territory. Is that an adjustment you have to make? The Americans sing along with us and that's the biggest thing for us to hear. We're an 11 hour flight away from home, and people sing our songs. That's crazy. Let's hear '7 Years' right now. - That's us, Mam! Me singing. - You're kidding. - Stop kidding. - No, it's us. - We just recorded it. - Whose voice is this? It's me singing. I heard this song. I like it. - Very cool! - I have to take a picture over there. It's a billboard with all our names on it. Crazy. I'm officially out of a job. - Damn! - They sure could sing along. No one's ever sung along like that before, right? When it's children, grandparents, parents, teenage girls... A man or a woman, saying they've sung it with their grandchildren. "Sung our hearts out to '7 Years'. We wish you a long and prosperous career.” Give us a high five, Morgan. Crazy thing is, I wrote about becoming a dad - - and now my fiancée is pregnant. I'm gonna have a little baby girl in September - - so the song is becoming truth, which is kinda crazy. I think I got teary-eyed. It made me think of my dad, of family. It wasn't the intention with the song, but quickly back home - - when we started playing it live, that's what we got from everyone. It gets people thinking in one way or another. It's impossible to turn on the radio without hearing the no. 1 hit song - - all the way from Denmark, '7 Years', Lukas Graham. Denmark has invaded the studio, because we have Lukas Graham and his motley crew. You guys are like the Bruce Springsteen of Denmark. We'll take that as a compliment. There's a lot of buzz around you. It's our first big, international adventure. We're pretty psyched. Direction shows ambition. To tour all across America is weeks or months of work. That's a long time to be away from home. Our dream was always America, so if and when we gotta go, we gotta go. And if you can't follow that, I'm sorry, you're just not with the team. Keep going, right? We're no. 1 in the whole damn world. It's party time! Guys, check out Lukas Graham. He's the man. You guys are awesome. If we're gonna walk into a situation where we're making fools of ourselves - - at least we want to know beforehand. I just had the lovely phone call where I couldn't say anything right. Everybody has to work. Everybody has to eat, right? - She needs to get it off her... - I'd love to say she'll get used to it. - Or it'll get better, but it won't. - Yes, it will. Most definitely. Once she's ready to join you, things will be different. That's good. Stretch. Nice. He's cooking, so he's happy. Oh, they smell too good. - You definitely know how to cook, Lukas. - All we need is a bit of blue cheese. I think people like that we do what we like to do, and we don't compromise. You're seeing huge international acceptance - - with top 5 debuts on charts around the globe. How are you feeling about that? It's pretty awesome to be allowed to have a top 5 song around the world. It's also hard to describe the feeling. We've been working towards this for many years, and now that you get it - - you can say success has always been a great liar. In the sense that once you achieve your goal - - you're already aiming towards the next one. You know what I mean? You need to take your time... Like, now we're in Charlotte, North Carolina - - so taking the time to walk around town, go sit in a park, look at the ducks - - and be like, wow! I'm actually living my dream right now. Because it can quickly become focused on the nightmare rather than the dream. The not sleeping enough, not getting time to work out, eat good food - - and it's all just hotel rooms, planes, buses and venues. So it's a balance. You gotta keep the balance. Sure. Great. And tell me what you like about performing live. What is there not to like? You're so awesome. Thank you. I love you. - We can't go on a bender. - No. I think he's unconcerned about it. - I just wanted a picture. - I was trying to help you. Everyone who wants something signed, right at the back. Everyone who wants a picture, come to the front. We'll do it quicker that way. I just wanna thank you. That was something not a lot of artists... I wish I could stay forever, but I have to get a shower. We have a long drive. - I'm sorry for your loss. - It's no problem. For real, it... Yeah. Write a letter to her, literally. Get something off your heart. You don't have to show it to nobody. Our system sucked. I told the ones taking photos to come to the front. And in the end it was like, "Can I have another photo?" No, I just got here for work. We're from Denmark. The whole family's still on the other side of the Atlantic. - What do you do? - I sing and write music. We're in a band. Lukas Graham is the band name. I was studying law before I got my record deal. Pretty glad I didn't have to work with law. My father passed away, so my language has slowly been getting smaller and smaller. Well, life happens and then the shit goes on, eh? I wrote this poem the other day. I was pissed off with all the people - - who wanted stuff from me, and I was sad I didn't have my father. So I said: I'm mad at him for leaving. I'm mad at me for not keeping my head up. I'm mad at all those people who want a piece because, folks, I'm fed up. I'm stripped of the possibility of dignity and privacy. They want an autograph and a picture just by the sight of me. Is it right of me to be angry or is it wrong to be sad? Now I've got all these things that I wanted, but I don't have a dad. So... And he wouldn't have wanted me to stop, you see? Last night I thought, "I have to start taking care of myself." That's why we haven't upgraded any concerts. So you can actually meet all the fans. You can't do that with 1500 people. If it takes us 1.5 hours to write for 400 people, what about 1,500? That's crazy. - When is the show? - At 6 o'clock, there's... - But when is the show? - At 8:10. 8:10, so I have to be done eating at 5:10. What's the time? It's 4:20. There's a restaurant around the corner. - Can we look at it now? - Upstairs. I'm getting a lot of good greetings from the company people. Dan McCarroll, the president of Warner Bros.: "Just want to say hi - - and that everyone that has seen the shows in different cities are loving it. I hope you're having a blast. Life is a gift, my friend - - and you get to share your gift and songs with people and move them. What could be better? Enjoy it. Thanks for all the hard work." Nice. How has your dad's passing - - either affected or influenced what you're doing these days? He died at a point where there wasn't really any way to slow down the train. It was going full steam, I guess. We'd just had a week in Germany doing 5, 6, 7 interviews a day. And that Friday where we had 3 interviews in Hamburg and 4 in Berlin - - we went to a dinner at night and had a great time in my hotel room later. We were celebrating that 'Drunk in the Morning' had entered the charts at no. 1. So we were drinking champagne and smoking weed. Then my tour manager came in and told me that my dad had died. Let's all sing together. One, two, three. I've had a lot of people tell me: "You're not dealing with it properly." How do you know how I need to deal with this shit? How can anybody know? How can you patent pain and dealing? How can I tell you how to deal with your pain? It's not a physical possibility. You might think you know better, but at the end of the day, it's my broken heart. There was a beautiful saying: It's not as if my heart is broken... ...because it breaks every time again. It keeps breaking. But it's okay, it's all right. Like for me, I'm not ashamed - - that I can cry in an interview, because it's because I love my father. It's a successful breaking of the heart that happens every day when you wake up. Just like that, and it hits you again and you realize: Fuck, he's not here! Welcome on board. - What's in the back? - A huge bathroom. - This is insane. - This is next level. There's no crowd. We're playing for each other. We're just gonna chill. Incredible. Thanks, guys. Hey, Seattle. It's Lukas Graham on Seattle's New Hit Music. It's the way we get to you the best songs, the biggest artists. - Great. Lukas, no. 14. - All in one place. - No. 15. - I'll see you there. - Let's do a "we'll see you there". - We'll see you there. I don't want to do the sound check today. It sounds good every night. We've risked a lot to change the schedules. It's a combination of working hard and finding time for your family. I love you, baby. Bye, darling. - What do we do now? - I just want to go home to my wife. - When are we going to Europe? - On May 23rd. - And when are we in London? - The 25th, 26th and 27th. So maybe, on the 24th, I'll... I just need to find one gap in the schedule. There's no gap. It was 6 weeks, now it's 4.5 weeks. I made a promise that I wouldn't be gone for more than 4 weeks. And you can try, but you can't always keep that promise. - Hey. Lukas. - Nice to meet you, man. - Lukas Graham? - Yeah, I just wanted to... Eminem did rap battles down here. Some of the first records I bought. I couldn't believe you were playing a place this small. - Will you take one picture with me? - We're doing pictures after the show. - It's nice playing a small venue. - Yeah, we said no to upgrades. Yesterday in Chicago, we got swamped after the gig, so I thought: If I stand in the crowd and people see I'm a regular guy - - everyone will be a little more cool after the show. So cheers. Thank you for writing "You're Not There'. Our mom passed away last year... It doesn't get better. It just gets a little easier to cope with. Imagine it as waves. It swells. - Thank you. - Thank you, man. - Thanks for coming. - Wow, there's a lot of people. I can't believe you started the show with 'Criminal Mind'. I was like, "I'm not gonna cry." My brother was incarcerated for 15 years. Can I have a very quick second? Will you sign this for me, please? - Can I take a selfie with you? - Of course you can, sir. I guess that's why you always get high or drunk after a show. So that you're not left with all of these suppressed feelings... You're completely open after a show like that. It's so annoying. Either give me a beard, or no fucking beard. This is just annoying. If I don't shave, I just get eight long hairs on my chin. I love you, I was about to say. I love you and I miss you, babe. See you tomorrow, love. We should stop filming conversations on the phone. That's truly annoying. There's something about hearing yourself play the bass at Wembley, you know? When you go on tonight, this screen will be down. - You stand behind it as it goes up. - Sure, we'll stand there. Crazy. I have to post it on Snapchat. Lasse, get Heidi to promise us - - that we'll never be forced to play a cover we don't want to again. - This is the first and only time. - We should've just refused to perform. - But we want to. - We want to, but like... As Magnus and I discussed, it's annoying that you have to "buy" air time. If 'Mama Said' is a good song, they should play it. Instead of making this exchange. We could have played a thousand cover songs - - but we have to play a hit from 2016. Shut up! We can't do anything about it now, but I'll fix it. - What's up, Luke? - What's up? All the way up there, they were going like this. When Lukas and Magnus left, you were just gone. Then Lovestick and I were left behind to take care of it all. - How was it, Lukas? - Awful to end with a Justin Bieber hit. I've never had a worse day of work in my entire life. Thank you. I'm in Denmark with my dear girlfriend. I've been home 3 days, she's pregnant. BREAKDOWN And I start crying while we're having breakfast. And she asks me, "What's wrong?”, and I just don't know. And she says, "You shouldn't go to Japan feeling like this. You should just do what you can.” I'm done. Ever since my father died, I've been incredibly lonely. - Typical. - Yeah, doing the opposite. It's kind of like couple's therapy. Thanks. - Would you like me to pack your bags? - That would be so nice! See you! Get up, man! Can I just lie here for 5 minutes before they come get me? How about a little burp? Isn't it great? - There they are. Hi Lukas! - Lukas, we can't wait! Hi Denmark! We already experienced it on our last tour. In the US, everything is crazier. Some people just don't get what it is that we do. And that you need privacy. Bring my stuff, so I can go home right after the show. As long as you're all packed. - Can we take a quick picture, please? - I have to go to my little baby girl. - Hello! - Hello! "Dear Lukas, you're an asshole. I just met you at the hotel and you told me - - you don't do pictures. You'd rather be a good father than a famous father. Okay, that's bullshit." Seems like he used Google Translate. "You know how bullshit that sounds? If you wanna be a father, stay home. Why did you get into this business? Forget it. I don't need your picture. To all his fans: He's staying at the Palomar San Diego. Go fetch him a bone. Suck my dick, Lukas Graham. I hope you get what you deserve, one-hit wonder." Those people make me nervous. Why does he have to say where you're staying? It's scary to think that someone who knows you - - might jump at you out of nowhere. You're thinking about that because we just had a baby, right? I just think it's scary. It's weird. How long has he been waiting around for a picture? I think it's scary. I have to say. Oh well... I don't know what people want. They want more. People want something that no one else got. - They want likes. - People want likes on their photos. The world and life is just not about likes. - Yes. - No, babe. But it's obvious that it is. You can buy likes. It's a thing. You can pay to get likes. It's love. The Grammy nominations are in. For the 2017 Grammy... - Here are the nominees: - '7 Years' by Lukas Graham. Three Grammy nominations including Record and Song of the Year. So we've got Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. One Grammy nomination is better than 10 VMA awards. Exactly. It's the biggest achievement there is. - Just to even get nominated is huge! - And we've got three nominations. You're a Grammy-nominated drummer. How does it feel? For the rest of my life, I'm a Grammy-nominated drummer. - Go edit your Wikipedia page. - Yes, I have to. - Grammy-nominated bassist. - Got a nice ring to it. I like being a Grammy-nominated singer and songwriter. - That's badass. - God-damn badass. We're getting an American Grammy. I'd love to be the first Danish artist to take home Song or Record of the Year. That would be legendary. That's the dream. You do look good in suits. We're on our way to the Grammys. When you were growing up, were the Grammys something that you thought: "I wanna be a part of that one day."? Even if we win all three, we won't understand that it's happened. We gotta show them all the details at home. - We're wearing clothes. - They're not naked. That's good. You guys can go back to the dressing room and have a few beers. The Academy's night to celebrate musical excellence has only just begun. Winning a Grammy award is a moment to remember. Let's see who has one of those moments right now. Here are the five nominations for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. And the Grammy goes to... 'Stressed Out', Twenty One Pilots. That was the one where we stood a good chance. But we've got another two. So let's see. And the Grammy goes to... ...Hello', Adele. So tonight, let's see - - which of these memorable songs wins this unforgettable honor. - And the Grammy goes to... - Come on! ...'Hello'. Well, it was fun to be here. It's crazy. It was fun to be here. Motivation! This is a motivational Grammy. We didn't win. We gotta get better! You get a little kick in the ass to motivate you to get better. They tease you, like "You might win three... Just kidding!" Can we not be Grammy-nominated again so we have to sit through that? You get that rush to your head, but you won't get it! - You're not good enough yet. - What do you get? Nothing. I'm almost crying. I'm not number two. I've never been number two. It's fine to pretend that just being here is winning, and it is. I thought we would win. I thought it'd be the surprise of the night. I don't want anyone giving me some self-righteous speech - - about being happy to be here, because I am. I'm just pissed we didn't win. - And I don't want to pretend it's okay. - English! If we were speaking English, everybody would know what assholes we are. We're just disappointed. I'm not gonna pretend that I'm not disappointed and pissed off. - You shouldn't be pissed off... - I can be exactly what I want, Jamie. This is why I didn't say it in English. Some annoying person would tell me - - how what I'm feeling isn't the right feeling, so fuck off. - Did you just tell me to fuck off? - No, I will fuck off. I think that's a better idea. Viola? Food? In less than a day, I apologized to Jamie. I'm not the type who feels content. I'm working on that. I don't want to be the type of dad who's never content with himself - - or with his children, you know? I don't want to be the discontented guy. One thing I've written on this album for Viola is... "I hope your big dreams don't turn into nightmares." Luckily, there aren't a lot of nightmares. Yet. - She hurt herself in kindergarten. - Oh no, a new... - A new incident report. - Oh no. - Viola, do you want me to draw, too? - Yes. I'm no good at it. - They grow up fast, huh? - Do you understand me? That's scary! I'll draw, then. A red sun. Yes. - Hi, Mom. - Hi, darling. Can you make some tea? The thing is, I've got 3.5 pages of stuff I need to get fixed for the house. And I'm just trying to get it done while I'm not in Paris or London or... I'm just trying to do my bit at home and it's not as easy as I wanted it to be. Hello, honey bunny. I'm at my mom's house. I'll come home soon. You sound... You sound happy. Are you happy right now? You sound like it. Hi, baby. Can we do that? Now? - Now I see why you wanted me home. - Let's see, it might not be right. - Should we say it out loud? - We can just have a look. Do you see those two lines on that stick? Two small lines. Did we get on camera that we just found out you're pregnant? - Looks like it! - It works twice. We just found out. It will be wonderful. Shows like this are why people become drug addicts. How the fuck do you get down after that? It's your high. If I told my dad I was upset I didn't get a Grammy - - he'd probably tell me to shut up. He'd be more interested in the fact that we've been touring all over the US. Write it, sing it, play it. Share it. Tell your story, play an instrument, sing a song. Half of the audience were lined up before the doors opened. So if you ever doubt your own success, just ask - - are there people who spend their money - - on standing in line in freezing London to see your show? Then you are a success. It's hard to see the true milestones - - until you've passed a couple of the wrong ones. We forgot to buy a pink present for Granny. Viola wants you to buy a pink present. Should I go check the bathroom? Viola!
