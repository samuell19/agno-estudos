Although our school doesn't have a choir I have experience in conducting our students Have your students won any awards in competitions? They have performed in the HK Schools Music Festival They've received an 'A' grade Does an 'A' grade mean the top prize? In which category? There's no ranking or point system In the 'Special Schools' category Sun And this one Moon Moon Good morning Good morning everyone Okay, please sit What number is this? One, two, three, four Four Correct, that's four One, two Three Four Five Six, seven, eight, nine Ms. Sau, please help us out After To-to changed his medication He's lost his appetite And hasn't eaten anything since last night But he has to take this medication, what should we do? I'm not free right now Go over there and line up Okay Let's consult your doctor And see if there's a better option "Mid-Autumn Festival folk songs" We're learning about Mid-Autumn Festival folk songs These are the songs Does anyone know what these are? These are staves They go from C, D, E, F, G, A, B To-to We're in class now No more playing with toys, understood? Do you understand? Ka-long, what are you doing? Drawing What Class are we in right now? Music Is it for music class? Alright, put it away This is music class Go ahead What are these? C, D, E, and what's next? Can you sing it for me? "Kai Kwong School" I don't wanna go this way Why not? School is that way Come on, come on No! What's wrong? Behave You're giving me a headache Come on, let's go I don't wanna go this way I can't help that there's a roadblock What's going on? Are you not listening? The bell's ringing, let's go Hey! What are you filming? Please don't film him. You're scaring him Nonsense, I'm not filming Please just go Please get up The bell's ringing, you'll be late - I don't wanna go - Come on, let's go What's wrong? Let's go, you'll be late Ms. Chui, thank God you're here Hey there, why are you sitting here? I like the usual route to school Take a look "Park" - Recognize this? - Yes This was the park you just walked through, right? Yes Alright then, let's go This way Thanks, Ha Tau Please make a copy of this document Yes, principal Kit from my graduating class Is as capable as Ha Tau Kit is capable, of course The school really wanted to hire him But we only had one opening If we can afford a musical Why don't we hire more graduates? Take a look at this clip Kit's mother sent this to me - No! - Come out! We don't know how long he has to wait Until he's admitted to a sheltered workshop He's doing nothing at home every day "Landlord insisted on a 30% rent increase" "How about we move to a smaller apartment?" We don't want to see cases like Kit's But if our school only hired our own graduates It'll perpetuate the same problem This musical that we're putting on Is for the outside world to get to know our students To change their perception, so our students have a better chance "Will you send your father to an elderly home?" "Let me think about it" Ms. Chui How's the musical coming along? We're prepping right now Good, we're counting on you On to the next topic on our agenda "Kai Kwong Musical" Thanks for participating in Kai Kwong School's musical Students from Kai Kwong, let's welcome our guests Step forward Shake hands and ask for each other's names What's your name?

Xiao-li I'm Xiao-li Think about it We have to commute such along way to rehearsal They're either retarded or from the mainland What's the value in this? I thought you wanted to impress Miss Chan So that she'd give you a better grade Hello? Mom? I can't leave yet I don't care about my grades I'm going to Central Saint Martins anyway Hey What's up? What do you think? Should we come again? But... If we quit the musical now Will that piss off Miss Chan? If accidents occurred, we'll be in trouble With the parents, you understand? I know, principal But this is a completely voluntary activity And I think it's a great opportunity For our students to get to know Students with intellectual disabilities It's quite meaningful 7 to 8 students signed up originally But they all said they were busy So... There's one more student on the way I understand, It's okay Ms. Chui, I see that other kids have a lot of activities - But Shun doesn't have any - Ms. Chui, I'm glad I caught you Sorry to interrupt Why is Ka-long still counting from 1 to 100? He's learned this before He's really smart, you can give him more advanced homework I'll see to it Ms. Chui, please give Shun another chance I'll do my best Ms. Chui, you really have to give him more advanced homework He's a smart kid, trust me I'll see to it - You really have to - Alright - You all better head home - You promised Thank you Grace Hey Thanks for bringing so many students today You're welcome You've helped me out in school before But just so you know I can't come next time This extra-curricular activity Wasn't authorized by my school I let the students come voluntarily I understand I won't make it difficult for you Any updates on my interview?

This special programme Requires you to complete 30 hours of volunteer service You should've received a notice That states very clearly If you participate proactively The school will pardon all your misdemeanors Alright, I get it I think I know more about people with special needs They have a really rough life Some can't control themselves And some can't communicate verbally So I feel that we should cherish our talent Very good, any others? I think it's very meaningful Because they don't get to play with People like us very often I feel really happy being able to help them I hope there will be more opportunities To help others I ... Have learned a lot Although they have these problems They still try really hard So I want to be as positive as they are I can't believe they can spin the ball like that They were teasing me just now Seems like you belong here Ng Ka-ho It's not right of you to say that Come on She's only been here a day, what's the big deal?

Take a look, Principal There's more All this homework Was very well done He did it himself, nobody helped him Judging from our interview today I'm sure Ka-long is a wonderful young boy But he is studying in a special school A regular school like ours isn't suitable for him I thought if he passed the...

I wanna make one too I found some recipes online But they're all in English I don't get it Show me This website is great This brownie is delicious If you bake it perfectly The crust will be crunchy It will be gooey inside The molten chocolate will ooze out Zoey passed most of her subjects But her ranking is a bit low Especially for visual arts and mathematics If she'd like to apply for HKU or CUHK The chances are quite slim I personally recommend Perhaps City U or Poly U Might be easier for her Miss Chan My daughter is struggling now Then teach her to be better She will improve But if you've made up your mind already She definitely won't improve I was also a student of your chancellor Sister Paulina Should I have a conversation with her To discuss your method of teaching? All I wanted was for you to study hard You couldn't even do such a simple thing Did you even make an effort? I was already open-minded You wanted to study art I knew there was no career in that But I let you do it anyway But you still failed it, didn't you? Tell me, what do you want? Crying again All you do is cry How will you survive in the real world? And why are you still so terrible at math? How about this? You're free every Tuesday and Thursday after school We'll add another tutoring class It won't change anything I have an extra-curricular activity on Thursdays What activity? You should be studying in your free time Your DSE exams are coming up next year Looking at Ka-ho's progress He probably won't get into local universities He has potential in photography Instead of wasting time here We should let him... Just let him take the DSE exams He's just not trying hard enough I've told you to study harder Do I really have potential? Mr. Hung, are you serious? Where can I study that? Still messing around? In fact, photography is an expertise Mrs. Ng, please reconsider This is the photography guide I bought For the class at the community centre a few years ago I dug it up especially for you Thank you, Mr. Hung Your thirty hours of volunteer service is completed Your previous misdemeanors are pardoned But I hope you'll go through with this musical "Life could've been perfect" Hello?

I actually want to be a chef You say that now, but what about the future? You won't know what you want in the future You wouldn't know I understand I'm not saying being a chef is bad But I want you to have more options I promise you Once you graduate from university You can do whatever you want I won't stop you, alright? This upcoming year Will determine the next few decades of your life Just do well on the DSE exams And forget about everything else, okay? I don't care if you'll lack money or achievements I'm just worried that you'll be working At a job that you don't like It'll be too late for regret And I won't be able to help What's wrong with studying in Hong Kong? If you send her abroad She'd end up in a crappy university anyways That's not what you said when her brother got into Stanford This is different, he got the scholarship on his own Cut the crap, you only care about your money If you're so capable, then think of a solution yourself I've decided to send her abroad Without spending a dime from you You're being unreasonable, I'm done with this Hey! Why aren't you in bed? Go back to bed Hello?
