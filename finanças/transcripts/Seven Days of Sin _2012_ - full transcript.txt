7 DAYS OF SIN After Hitler came to power in 1933, most of the German-speaking population of the Sudetenland – the mountainous border region of Czechoslovakia – wanted to join the Reich. Czechs and Germans who had been neighbors now became enemies. A person cannot choose the era into which he is born. My story began before the war, in 1938. Hitler demanded the annexation of the Sudetenland to Germany. Here on the isolated farmsteads, relations between Germans and Czechs reached boiling point. I remember my wife as if it were today. It was mid-September when I married her. The daughter of the German farmer Ignatz Schreier. Agnes. He's come to see his daughter. Father... We're glad that you've come, Mr. Schreier. I just want... her to be happy. She will be. That I promise. He doesn't look very happy. You won't see him at the reception. Be quiet! This will bring nothing but trouble. God bless you. The Lord God commands that you leave your father and mother, brothers and sisters, and all relatives, and join in eternal faithfulness. I, Agnes, take you, Jan, as my true and faithful husband. I promise to remain your faithful, loving and serving wife. I shall never abandon you, but shall be with you always, in good times and in bad, till death do us part. I, Jan, take you, Agnes, as my true and faithful wife. I promise to remain your faithful and loving husband. I shall never abandon you, but shall be with you always, in good times and in bad, till death do us part. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder. In nomine patris et fili et spiritus sancti. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. - Cheers! - Cheers! - You dance well. - You think so? I don't. Oh boy. Your brother Jürgen is here. See? They still care about you. You don't know him. He knows no bounds. Come on... What are you doing?! Honza, please tell him to leave. Don't worry. We'll soon all be having a toast together. - I'll go. - No, no, no. May I? Of course. You can't refuse my own cousin. What's going on? Honza! You don't respect our father. You'll pay for that, you abortion! What are you doing, Jürgen? What are you doing? Leave him alone, you Nazi! - Stop it! - Whore! Better off you go. German bastard. You've disgraced my family, our home, my sister, that whore! Bastard! - The soldiers are here. - Honza! - Are you okay? - Better off we go. Honza! You German bastards! Those German pigs! Jürgen, I'd like to...! Let's go home. Look what they've done to me. Do you see? Agnes... The Sudetenland has been officially annexed to the Reich. Agnes? Where are you? Do you know our motto? Be prepared. I am. Me too, my little scout. Doesn't it bother you that the little scout is married? Come on. You devil. Hello. Sorry... Hello. Who are you? Pardon the interruption. Reich forestry. Personnel. Schmidt. What do you need? Has something happened? It's about your application. Your wife's father has put in a good word for you. But if you want to be forester, you will have to be a citizen of the Reich. But I'm Czech. Look, you're living pretty well here. You have a German wife, you live in a German state. You probably even have German goats. You should be German, too. Fill out the form, and your problems are solved. Right, thank you. - You're welcome. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. I signed it two days later. Most of my friends left for the interior, but I wanted to stay in the mountains. To do the work I enjoyed, and to be with my wife. The next year, Hitler took the rest of the republic, and in September the war began. Nobody thought that it would last a long six years. May 1945, Day 1 - We should have left in '38. - And where would we have gone? To Bohemia, or to my mother in Olomouc! Your father never accepted me anyway. - That's not true! - Yes, it is! He got you all the right papers. He hates me. And Jürgen, too. A child would have made it all better. Believe me. Sorry, but it's not my fault we don't have a child. If you'd been with Marie, you'd have your children by now! A feast for the eyes. All you have to do is stretch out your arm and open your hand. What about those 7 years here in the Sudetenland? Did they disappear down the drain? We should've fought back in '38. I always said so! And that's why you all ran away?! Hey, you weren't so bad off here, right? Not another word, asshole! Ho. Forward, little one. Just a little bit. Heel. Where are the others? Ran away. The Russians came. They took Ostrava. - And you're not afraid? - No. I'm old. Where did you get the ammo? Where? Czech pig! Here, have a look. Come on. Into the cellar with you! Please! We haven't done anything! Leave us alone! The Raškov farm. The only Czech farmstead around. - Bozděch! - Hm. Dohnal and 10 men with me. The others guard the road. Hide those things in the woods. Will do. Boys! Let's go! Come on! Come on! They only took food. Our luck. Careful with that. - We should bury them. - Fuck it! What are you doing here? You don't have to be afraid of me. I won't tell anyone what you saw here. Come here! Come here, you whore. I'll show you. I'll show you, you whore! Come here, heel! Sit! Come on! She ran away. She's in the woods by now, the whore! - Hey, goulash. - Let me see. Pretty good for a German! She's here somewhere. Jesus! Fucking bitch, I'm bleeding! Fuck! Fuck. Shut up! Be quiet! Be quiet... What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Did you come to steal? No, no. We came to see you. Bullshit! Bullshit! Shut your mouth, shut your mouth! Put it away! Put it away! We're going to have some fun with him. Leave him alone! You idiot, why did you shoot? You shot one of my men. I thought you were thieves. Your cousin Lubor's been made chairman. He's invited you to today's celebration. You're supposed to come with us. Now! Someone attacked the Raškov farm. What did you see? Nothing. Just smoke from a distance. I was afraid they might be here. Hero! Come on. We've got a car at the crossroads. Don't go anywhere! You've spent the whole war hiding behind her. Why are you walking around in front of them like that? Do you hear? Why? I fell from the hayloft. Well go get dressed! Do you hear?! Get dressed! Get out of here! Friends, to our new chairman! To the former illegal county committee. - To our partisans! - To Lubor. Long live Lubor! Long live Lubor! Friends, thank you for your trust. Thank you for coming. I personally believe that we will soon put things in order along the border, and that we will bid farewell to all collaborators and German lackeys! Friends, comrades. We have a very special visitor today. Major Uvarov, commander of the Soviet military district. To Major Uvarov! There is something hanging in the air here in the room today... I mean to say the air is stifling hot, and there is sweat pouring down my forehead. And down my back, too. We can laugh today, because the war is over. It has been a long journey. And God save those who would violate the peace that we have bought with our blood. Long live your free republic. Cheers! Cheers! Get up and go home! I came to congratulate you on your election, Lubor. Thanks, Honza. Come and sit with us. I'm glad you've come. I had no idea you were with the partisans. My father didn't know for a long time, either. A lot of people bought it just months before the end. It's a good thing they voted for you. It'll calm people's nerves. All of us in the mountains were worried about what would become of us. The main thing is that this filthy war is over. - You're right. Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. Want a smoke? Thanks, I have my own. Right. Are you from Šumperk? Staré Město. Altstadt? Altstadt. But I'm Czech. Your father fought in Russia? Well, yes. But in 1918, he switched to your side. Fine. And on whose side did he fight after the revolution? He was in the Legion. He fought on the Trans-Siberian railway. And you wear a red star? I don't like people who wear red stars and own hotels. Got it? Excuse me, Honza. I've got some work. Sure. It's your day. What? You won't drink with me? What the hell? You shot one of my boys! I don't want to get too drunk. Then get a little drunk! Cheers. Day 2 The German settlement of Talhof was lying in ruins. As if everything had changed overnight. And my intimately familiar world had ceased to exist. What? Water. Wait a moment. I'll be right back. Drink. Water. Drink. Drink. Agnes? Agnes, are you here? Saron! What is it? What's with you? What's wrong, little Saron? What is it? What's wrong? Come here, boy. My God, what happened to you? What happened, Saron? My God. Agnes, are you here? Mr. Schreier! Mr. Schreier? Mr. Schreier? Mr. Schreier? Agnes! Are you here? Agnes! Get on board. - Move it. - Get on board. - Please leave us alone. - Get on board. - Forget your suitcase! - Quickly! - Get on board. - Move it! Move it! Are you looking for someone? - When is the train to Olomouc? - Not until tomorrow morning, little lady. And how much for two tickets? Seven marks. But the ticket office is closed. Thank you. You're welcome. If you're looking for the chairman, he left just a moment ago. Do you know where he went? - You're the chairman's cousin, right? - Yes. He probably went with Mr. Brachtl to the hotel for lunch. I really don't know where they went. Hanka, you can go. How long since we last saw each other? Almost the whole war. Remember how we ran away from him at that party? I remember. I also remember how you married him anyway. Because of all this. Agnes has disappeared. I thought you were happy together. Put that away. I'm looking for Agnes. She didn't come home. Someone killed her father! Old Schreier? Yes. I couldn't find Lubor. You have enough men. You could order a search. She's German! I'll let you know if she happens to cross my way. But only because of Lubor. Honza! Honza! Is that you? Is someone there? Come on. Go on out. Agnes? Is that you, Agnes? Day 3 Come on! Get up! Get up! What're you gawping at? You're a Reich citizen. You're German. How was your night ride? Get to work! Move it! Move it! Why did you bring me here? You won't be shooting anyone anymore! And no more poaching! Can I speak to the chairman? Let's go! Stop! Get back! - Back to work! - Move it, move it! I want to see you work, you bastards! Get to work! - Arbeit! Arbeit! - Move it! Hi, Jürgen. Two for Olomouc? One ticket. Fourteen crowns. But yesterday you said marks. Yesterday isn't today. This isn't the Reich, you know. Get your documents ready. Documents! Show me your documents! You're coming with us! Friggin' a. Got him! Bullshit. Shut your traps or there won't be any grub. Thanks. How did you end up here? They scattered us near Ostrava. - What about my parents? - Shut your trap and get lost! Move it! Move it! Stop gawping and get a move on! To work. Let's get working! Get up! Hi. I hear you wanted something from me. Yeah, I've been looking for you since morning. How come you picked up Olšan? Explain yourself! Dohnal filed a report. Because of the shooting. Don't make me laugh! He's got a hole in his arm! Release him and bring him to me. Now! - As you wish, but... - But what? Why don't you tell me where Agnes is? Find her. And I want Olšan here now! - Come on! Quick! Run! Let's go! - What are you doing? What did you do, you idiot? No. No, no, don't shoot! No, no, no, don't shoot! Get him! - Faster! - After him! Get him! Where the hell are you running to? What did you do that for, you idiot? Stop blabbing and move it! Maybe they went... Shut your mouth! Maybe this way. No need to shit your pants! Agnes is missing, lost. She was lost a long time ago. Fuck it, she ran off with someone. Are you surprised? And my father? You shouldn't have done that back there at the quarry. Lubor would have helped us. What is with my father? I'm sorry. They killed him. Day 4 - For Chrissakes, what are you doing here? - I need to talk to you. - Come inside. - Have you found Agnes? - No. - I thought you might know something. - No, but they're looking for her. That guard from the quarry is dead. What? I didn't want... I didn't want him to shoot. You'll have to explain it. You'll have to say that it was that abortion Jürgen. - He's a Nazi after all, so who cares? - But he's also my brother-in-law! That's Uvarov. He comes here every other day. Come on, come on! Some idiot told him that I live here. Wait here! Do you think that Agnes is all right? Don't ever stop believing that. Here. Now run. Run! We'll find her. You'll see. Run, run, run! Move it! Out of the way! The sidewalk isn't for you! Move it, move it! What's with you? What're you gawping at? Get lost! - Sir, please. Leave us alone. - We haven't done anything to you. Put that on right away. I won't have you making a scene here. It's enough that Karel died in Russia because of you! I need bread and milk for the children. They only brought flour. I need bread. For your nephew. Stop right there! Olšan, stop! Did you hear me? Olšan, stop! Fucking bastards. We're supposed to lead them across the border. It was just a few kilometers to the German border. I never learned why they didn't take them by train. I guess it was part of their plan. Get them across the border without any inspections or registrations. You're kind. I can't go on. I'm cold, mommy. Hang on, we're almost there. When will we be home again? Five-minute break! Come with me. Where to? The closer they get to the Reich, they more they get the shits. Get up! Let's go! Come on! Come on! - I'm afraid. - Come on! Give that to me. - Don't you know how to knock? - He was here! He kills someone, and then just calmly walks around town. Even if I knew where he was, it's my business. We're no longer partisans. You're the country chairman. You have to give him up! He was just a forester during the war! You put up Germans at your hotel! You think nobody knows that? You... ...partisan! That was uncalled for. I'll get Olšan. You can count on that! Vlasta, come on home! Go around the outside. Agnes! She's in Olomouc by now. Is someone there? Hey, kitty. Come here, I'll dust your hide. The shot woke us out of our lethargy, and we ran away. Away from our gamekeeper's house, up to the ridgetop. We could feel them on our heels. I kept wondering what had happened to my Agnes. Why she hadn't come home, and whether she was still alive. If you don't get them today, I'll sort you out. If I were you, there's no way I'd go back there. He has to go back home. Where else? Spread out! Search it up there! Move it! They're ahead of us! They're looking for us! I bet they're up in the rocks. Get a move on! Brachtl is only chasing us because of Marie, isn't he? She's a real whore, but a fine one, I'll give you that. He's chasing us because you're a Nazi. I thought it was because of that guy from the quarry. Did you at least get her into bed? Well did you, or didn't you? Shut up already! So why didn't you marry her?! You're going to have to marry Brachtl. A pretty couple. - And you don't want me? - They look good together. - He's standing there like a fool again. - He won't follow them into the woods. Get up! Come on, get up! Move it! Where is that abortion? Let's get out of here! Quick, let's go! Spread out! More to the right! Stop! Stop! Stop right now! Or you'll never see Agnes again! Come on, let's go! He's bluffing! Day 5 If you love Agnes so much, why didn't you give her a child? Not even our father lived to see a grandchild. - Or can't you get it up? - Stop running off at the mouth. She had two miscarriages. But she still wants a child. And you? Wait a moment! They were here. I'm afraid. Frankstadt is over the hill. It's as hot as an oven here! Why did you burn down Talhof?! Have you lost your mind?! - Comrade major, your visit is a... - Skip the niceties. I'm here because of the complaints. The war is over, but your boys are settling scores. The security division should have dealt with these complaints long ago. And then you say that it was Soviet soldiers who did it? How can a bunch of Germans complain about us? Germans? I'm sorry? You're saying Germans can't file complaints? And you call yourself a patriot? Where did you fight? How many of your partisans fell liberating Šumperk? How many? And 70 of our people! Where were you, you heroes? That was a real hero. If you don't... give me an explanation for all those complaints... ...you're going to Siberia. Got it? So where is Agnes? I really don't know. I guess she ran away. Who is that? I don't know. But they're Czechs. Vlasta, bring some bread and butter. Where are you with that bread? Go to your mother. Come on! Come on! - Shit, why'd you give her the bread? - Should I have cut her throat? You wouldn't have the guts! Pig! There won't be anything here. They're more thorough than we were in the Ukraine. How come they left this place alone? Come on! Give me a hand! There's nobody home! Which is German, and which is Czech? The white one or the black one? What the...?! - Which is German, which is Czech?! You! - Think you'll catch me? Czech or German? - Racially pure. - It doesn't even know Mein Kampf. And that is why I'm going to twist its neck. Wait! It's coming this way. Let it go, let it go. Let's go. Let's go! Come on! Let's go. What's he doing there? He's German. He keeps chickens, you idiot. And I could eat stones! Day 6 Where'd you learn that? It wasn't in the Ukraine. And we were supposed to win the war with people like you? You're nothing but thieves and poachers! Is that what your regulations say, Mr. Aryan? You won't catch a rabbit by ordering it around. I'll eat it myself! Shut up! The chicken breeder! Come on! Where'd he disappear to? He must've gone down there. Why's he going in there? Look. Shit, come here! What are you doing down there? Leave him alone! Get away from him! Cut it out. Come and help me. Once I get home, I'm going to get a good night's sleep. Maybe Friedrich is home already. I'm sure he's back from Russia! Someone's coming. You have to get out of here! Quick! Why so early? Has anyone been here? No. Got the stuff? You've been giving us nothing but dregs lately! Now that's better! And get a move on, or the new people will take it all for themselves! - Got some sheets? - There's nothing left in the village. What about that clock that you didn't take yesterday? You see? I almost forgot. Stupid idea. We're going to the camp. It might break. Oh yes, one more thing. If those two show up here, you know what to do. Do you hear? Who is it? Soldiers? Stop! Stop! - No, it's... - Back up! It's... It's... Oh God! Hide! Slow down! Hello. Good girl! Greetings! Let's go! You can't stay here. Thanks. Where did you get that clock? You're robbing our people, you scum! If you're hungry, eat! And watch your mouth! Why didn't you turn us in? If they catch you, they'll make mincemeat out of you. And I don't like meat, get it? But nobody's keeping you here. Don't go to the camp. I don't like it! What do you want me to do? Holy shit! Move it! Get in! Get in! Move it! Get in! Come on! - Time to go. - Abfahrt! If they caught her, she'll be in there. Do you think he caught her? I don't know. - I'm going. - You wait here! I'm sure she's caught their eye already. Was Friedrich here? He'll be back soon. Friedrich! Where is Friedrich? Friedrich! Please, open up! Please! Hey! Is that her? I need some medicine for my friend. I'll give you some aspirin, okay? Hanka, button me up! Hanka? Where are you? I'm sorry... I didn't know. I'm looking for you husband. He's not here. I'll be going then. What happened to you? Come to me. Don't be angry. I'm looking for Agnes. Come on, Jürgen. Have a sip. It's a miracle that Agnes is alive. I'd like to thank you. If it wasn't for you... To Agnes! - To Agnes. - To Agnes. I'll bring some bread. Real cognac. Well chilled, down in the cave. Get a move on, bitch! Brachtl will never let her go. I'll go. I'll go turn myself in! What are going on about? He can't... He can't just hold her like that. You fool. Wait. Where did you get that? You can write a report saying he was a collaborator. Me? You're crazy... Who do you think could own a hotel in the Sudetenland during the war? A Czech patriot? I slept there a hundred times. And the entire military command from Šumperk, too! And nobody ever paid anything. Pour me another! He filed reports in person. And those people who bought it a few months before the end? You think nobody knows? You think nobody knows?! I... I know all the names. He dictated his own prices! I'll write... I'll write only what I saw. Day 7 Did you deal with those complaints? The new settlers are doing the looting. It's in my report. Are you making fun of me? Uvarov didn't get any reports! You're always defending the Germans. You got your villa from them. Or is it because of Agnes? So now you're giving orders? Uvarov will be breaking down my door tomorrow. Christ, Honza. What are you doing here? You've locked up Agnes on the farm in Ostružná! No, no, no. I told you I'd get him. I'm going for the police. You're not going anywhere! Nice reading, hmm? And you're telling me that I'm defending Germans?! You me?! Get out of here. Get out, you... ...collaborator! Go! We used to all be friends. Release papers from Mr. Přikryl. Get lost. I have a surprise for you. A surprise? Jürgen is back from Russia. He's up in the village. That's good. New settlers. Czechs. They have a pretty little girl. You... You bastard! I'll go and get him. Wait here. I've brought Agnes, Jürgen. Get up! Get up, you pig! I know it was you. Come on, get up! You bastard! What have you done? You bastard! You think you can tell me what to do? Because of that whore! Honza! She'll squeal like a pig at slaughter, when I do it to her again! - She didn't do anything to you! - She married you and betrayed us. Like her brother. Fucking thief. He didn't say a word when I cut his throat. He should've croaked on the front. We'll fry you like that little girl down on the farm. This place is ours. Our land, our home! It's good... ...that you're here. Shall we go home? Yes, I'll take you home. Just like I promised. - Let's go home. - That's her. - Where is Friedrich? - This isn't the Reich, bitch. You'll come with us! We're moving out, let's go! Stop it. What are you doing here? You don't have to be afraid of me. I won't tell anyone what you saw here. Come here! Help! I'll show you, you whore. I'll show you! I'll show you! I'll show you, you whore! - You whore! - You bastard! You bastard! What are you doing?! I'll kill you, you bastard! What do you think you're doing?! You bastard! What are you doing, you bastard?! You bastard...! I'll kill you! I'll kill you, you bastard! I'll kill you, you bastard... I'll kill you, you bastard! She... She saw you. She saw you down there. Go after her. So she doesn't talk too much. You know what to do. Agnes and I never left the Sudetenland, even though she was German. After the war, we spent many beautiful years in our gamekeeper's house. Our home is here in the mountains. Perhaps I will meet with Agnes somewhere up there. Perhaps sometime soon. I am sure that she is waiting for me. Committee Chairman Lubor Přikryl was removed from office in June 1945. Major Uvarov was recalled around the same time. Between 1938 and 1947, some 2,800,000 people were expelled from or forced to leave the Sudetenland. There is no similar place in Europe.
