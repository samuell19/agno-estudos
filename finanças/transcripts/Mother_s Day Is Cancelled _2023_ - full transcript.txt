I love you. Well, hurry up then. - Come in. - Let's go. We've got three minutes! I'm coming, I'm coming! - Let's go. - Beautiful. You sure about this? Are you? Now we have two minutes. No, wait. I've got nothing borrowed and nothing blue. Thanks. I do. I do. How's it going, wifey? What's up, hubby? Come, come. I love you. This can't be for real! We got married! Come here. I can't believe it. We got married. You can't change your mind now. Lidia? No, I'm not saying it because of that. I'm saying it because of my mom. How am I going to tell her? No, you've got it easy. My mom always dreamt the archbishop would marry me off. When she finds out Elvis married us, I'm not sure she'll be pleased. Are you pregnant? If you got knocked up, it's okay. No, Mom! How could you think that? What do you expect? You've not said a thing about that Miguel. Manuel. I did tell you I was dating someone. Yes, but this is more than dating, right? Is the wedding legit or is it like at the fair? It's valid in Nevada. My darling girl... Be honest. Do you owe him money? Or was this wedding just to get a green card? Manuel is Mexican, Emilio. No, Lis. Going all that way just to marry another Mexican! -What a waste! -Hold on. We met doing our master's. We fell in love and decided to come here for spring break - and one thing... - Led to another and we thought, "Since we are here, "why don't we get married?" It's romantic. -Right? - It's a joke. Right, Manuel? You're such a joker. It's not a joke, Mom. Congratulations? Marriage is the patriarchy's invention to put limits on women, Manuel. Manuel! - Why didn't you tell us? -It was a snap decision. -We didn't plan it. - You didn't plan it? He didn't plan it. You didn't plan it! Manuel, you've devastated Mom. Mom, are you okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. My eldest son got married in Las Vegas to a woman we don't know. He didn't even bother to tell us, but I'm great. Happy even. Absolutely fantastic! EIGHT MONTHS AFTER THE WEDDING You're late for our date night, my love. I know, I'm sorry. Don't distract me. Dinner isn't done yet. Okay... How was your day? Why are you home so late? Because I had to attend a meeting with a really difficult client. Didn't we agree that you'd stop spending? I haven't spent any money. 18,000 pesos on a spa? That wasn't me. It was Esmeralda. That doesn't matter. How can I say no to my wife and kids? Like this, "No." Look at me. "No! "No!" We had a plan to make the money last a year and you've already spent it all in four months. In my defense, I thought Jorge was coming back. Francisco was conned out of all of his money by his own brother! And I'm the only one he's told. Okay. Double espresso with a drop of milk, as you like it. I spoke to everyone that I persuaded to invest with him. I said, "Don't worry, "he'll return remorseful with all of the money." He's in the Bahamas. I hope a shark eats him. I didn't know more people were involved in it. Yes. Some of our neighbors, friends, relatives, some of Lalo's school friends' parents, my gastroenterologist, my dentist, Esmeralda's fortune teller. It was her fault. She should have seen this coming before it happened. I promise from now on I will save. Large latte with coconut milk and double vanilla and a coffee from Chiapas for Francisco. Thanks. I should have ordered the smallest coffee, right? You have to tell your family the truth. I can't keep lying to Manuel. Don't worry, this can still be fixed. It's not going to be fixed! - Your brother is not coming back. - Okay. I'm going to tell them. - After Mother's Day. - No, no, no. You always use a holiday as an excuse. First you said Three Kings Day. Then Flag Day. Seriously? I just want Esmeralda to have one last perfect Mother's Day. Okay, fine. Take her out somewhere nice for lunch. Somewhere nice but cheap. Then tell them the truth. But if I take Esmeralda to a cheap restaurant, she will suspect something is going on. The boiler has broken again, honey. Did you hit it? - Hitting it won't make it work. - Did you talk to it? No. The Garcías have fixed things like that for years. This wouldn't have happened in the other apartment. But we couldn't afford the other condo, Manuel. - My parents were going to pay for it. - Yeah. That was really sweet and a lovely gesture but... when you marry someone it's to start over on your own. How did your interview go? We love your profile, - your resumé and your Stanford degree. - Thanks. The only thing we'd like to know is if you're related to Francisco and Jorge San Román. Of course. Francisco is my dad. Jorge is my uncle. We will be in touch. I think that... your name intimidates employers. They don't want to look like they're hiring you because of it. - Better things will come. - I hope so. In fact, that gave me an idea. I'm going to set up a business. - Doing what? - I've been brainstorming. The idea I liked most was craft beer. What were the other ideas? Craft tequila. Craft mezcal. As I have a master's from Stanford I thought of setting up a site for meeting friends, "Stanfriends." Like Facebook but for Stanford. Tomorrow I'll talk to Dad to see if he wants to go into business. It'll be called, "San Román beer". You know what? Let's go watch CSI. We're about to finish the season. I'll put it on. But we can't stay up watching it late as tomorrow's Mother's Day. Mother's Day is Cancelled What is the best thing about Mother's Day for me? It's a day where we can all be together. Where we spend, and spend some more. Pure marketing. It's being able to tell my mamacita she's a hottie. Another day for the patriarchy to suppress women. It's telling Mom I love her tons! Denisse de Kalafe. Denisse de Kalafe. Denisse de Kalafe. Denisse de Kalafe. I hate Denisse de Kalafe. Señora, Señora is Denisse de Kalafe's best song. And she has a few! It's an anthem to mothers. MOTHER'S DAY THE SAN ROMÁN FAMILY MOTHER'S DAY THE GARCÍA FAMILY Happy Mother's Day, Mom! My darling! You shouldn't have done all of this! It looks delicious. Mari made it. It's incredible. - It's all about the grip, son. - Let me try. No, that's a goner. No, the five-second rule. I'm Jaime Guelatao Martínez. I am originally from Oaxaca. I came into Rosita's life to love her, respect her and take care of her. I love spending time with you, pops. Mom, we made you breakfast! Happy Mother's Day, Rosita. Thank you, thank you. Hey, making me breakfast also includes you cleaning it all up, right? Gather round for a photo. Let's be clear that this is a really sexist day that trivializes the role of housewives. Yes, dear. You told me that last year and the year before. Come kiss me. Wish her a happy Mother's Day. Happy Mother's Day. Francisco, could you pass me that little bag? I have another gift for you. Wait. They are coupons for hugs. I made them. Don't use them all up today, okay? How sweet. What a great idea! 2011, pedicure coupons. 2014, mud facial coupons. 2015, alcohol leg massage coupons for varicose veins. What varicose veins? - Do you want to use one? - Yes! Cashed it in. I'm keeping tabs on that. How lovely! I made one for a massage to change it up. What is that? It's my gift from you. You shouldn't have, honey. Pass it to me, Francisco. - But what is it? - Just a little something. Isn't it beautiful? Yes, incredibly beautiful. Have you got the receipt? Francisco is such a joker. Smile for the photo. How stunning is that! So, first, I'm having breakfast and then I'm going back to bed until lunchtime, okay? Rosita... I can't believe you don't like this wonderful day. It was celebrated for the first time in Mexico, in Oaxaca in 1913. Although some say otherwise. They say otherwise because it's not true. - Who told you that? - Jaime. Well, it must be true then! I still remember doing special things for my mom on Mother's Day. - Happy Mother's Day, Mommy. - Thanks, Son. That's lovely. Jaime! Sorry, I got carried away. In your daydream, who was cooking? My mom. She'd spend the whole day in the kitchen. Of course, that's what I've been saying all along. In fact, this day was designed to have us moms spend it working. But Rosita, we're going to spoil you. We're going to make you pumpkin soup. And a mole coloradito and even a glass of tejate. Food that is typical of Oaxaca. Humanity's culinary heritage. Also, I have a surprise for you. What surprise? If he told you, it wouldn't be a surprise. Let's just say it's something that will change your life. Enough. This one. How does it look? Yes, great. Yeah. Okay, then. You have to be ready at 2:00 p.m. - because the reservation's at 3:00 p.m. - Wow! Dad, did you make a reservation? No, I did it. Go and get ready. Go on, go on. Get to it. - Are you happy? - Yes, I'm really happy. I'm sure this is going to be the best Mother's Day ever. Are you sure you don't want to have lunch with your mom? I'm sure. She hates Mother's Day. I don't want them to be upset that you spent it with my mom. I don't even know if she'd be up to let us in. She sleeps all day and says the best gift would be to forget she's a mom. Let's go. Yes, yes... I bet you weren't expecting the massage coupon. Today is full of surprises. And you've yet to see what's to come! Relax, Mom. The YouTube tutorial said it's normal for it to hurt a bit. Hey, Son. Do you know what surprise Jaime has in store for me? No, Mom. I can't tell you. I'm building a relationship with Jaime and want trust. Come on, it's my day. What I can tell you is that when he first told me, - I wasn't convinced. - Don't say that. Then I cried. But once I thought about it I said, "Great idea." Good to go. A two-minute massage. - Want to use another coupon? - No, no! I don't want to spend all of them, but this one can go. Yes. Just... Seven different types of milk? Who uses seven different types of milk? Mom drinks almond milk. Sofi drinks oat milk. I drink lactose-free. Lactose-free light for Mari, and normal cow's milk just in case. There's milk you like and milk Mom buys thinking Manuel might come round. But why do you care about milk? It's because of money, right? They told me at school. Everyone knows. Listen carefully, no one can know. If the rumors got back to me, Mom will soon find out. Yes, but it doesn't have to be today. Whatever you say. I have your back. However... my silence is going to cost you. 2,000 pesos. Don't you understand we have no money? That's why I have to start saving now. Therapy hasn't helped you one bit. Of course it has. I don't steal anymore. I just blackmail. My therapist said it's progress. I think I'll tell Dad about the beer at lunch today. You think that's a good idea? It's a highly saturated market, my love. However... this is going to be different. You'll see. You are going to tell him today? On Mother's Day? Stealing the limelight from your mom? I just want to know if my dad is interested in the idea. It is a good idea, isn't it? Yeah, it's a great idea. It's a wonderful idea. Mom. Dear mother-in-law! We brought you a gift. Lovely! I need to talk to you. Make yourself at home! I'll be back. Jaime is going to ask me to marry him. Wow! That's a bit soon. Look who's talking. You're to blame for all of this. Why is it my fault? I bet Jaime saw you getting hitched superfast and thought, "Everyone in this family must be the same." What's so bad about it? We all like Jaime. - Emilio loves him. - Yes, but I don't know if it's for life. What if I want to break up with him tomorrow? - Do you want to? - No! But I want to have the option. Well then, Mom, wait until he asks you then. I have a plan to stop Jaime proposing to me. What's that? I'll avoid being alone with him. Okay, then. - Forever? For life? - No, no! Just until he forgets about it. He's not going to. I don't plan on being alone with Jaime and you are going to help me. I never ask her for anything. How hard is it? Just a Mother's Day gift. Lidia was saying to me that she was really sad we're not spending Mother's Day together. - Really? - Yes. I almost cried. So I had to say we could spend it together. What about our meal, Rosita? Well... You said it yourself, Mother's Day was way too an important day to not spend it with my kids. Yes, it's your day. Do whatever you like. We have to go now. Well, then, I'll see you tonight, Jaime? No, come on. If one of us is going, we're all going. No, Manuel, I don't want to impose. No trouble at all. No! No, Manuel. Don't push him. - If he doesn't want to... - I do want to go, Rosita. Don't say that out of obligation. I'm not. I'd like to come. Don't say it just to make a good impression. I think he wants to go. Yes, to be with you, Rosita. Okay, then... Question, will your sister be there, Manuel? Yes. - Why? - No reason. What was that look? They've been inseparable ever since Christmas. I think they've fallen in love. Please... What? Don't you think a San Román could fall for a García? No, I just think no one could fall in love with Emilio. Well, maybe he fell in love with the donkey. Good boy, Ramiro. Don't you think he should live on a farm? This isn't a proper farm. No. He's a star. He loves the attention. Right, Ramiro? RAMIRO THE 3 LITTLE PIGS He's happy. Plus, when he doesn't like a kid, he bites them. Always discreetly so they don't realize. You're really funny. It's obvious that Sofía likes me. I hadn't noticed. That's my problem. I'm all casual and the ladies fall at my feet. Some men too. It's my sex appeal. I can't control it. Do you like her? Only as a friend but I don't know how to tell her. Just like that. Straight up. That's how you do it. What if I lie to her? Just to try it out. No, Emilio. That's not the right thing to do. I've got a plan. I can't be left alone with Sofi, okay? That's a terrible plan. That doesn't resolve anything. The only other option is to stop being this sexy, but I can't. How can I? I see where poor Emilio is coming from. I've been irresistible ever since I was a young lad. Classmates, even the teachers thought I was attractive. Everyone. I even had something with one of my aunts. A distant relation, but here in Oaxaca, that's really common. That's how I know that my rural good looks drive Rosita crazy. Ta-da! How lovely! How stylish! What an amazing gift! So you can feel like you were there. Ready. - I found the ugliest shirt I could. - Let's get going. It's not ugly, you look so handsome. Handsome and stylish. Good afternoon. - Do you have a reservation? - Of course. It's under Esmeralda San Román. - Yes, a table for six in the garden. - Yes. I see not all six are here yet. I'm sorry, I can't let you in. They're here. See? They've arrived. The whole pack is here! Did you invite them? No, obviously not. Happy Mother's Day to the world's most beautiful woman. Hi, sir. How are you? - Well, and you? - That's good. - Hello. - Hi, Rosa. Change of plans, there will be nine of us. Sorry, we're at full capacity. You can rearrange the table. No, a table for six is clearly not a table for nine. - I'm sorry. - Of course. Don't worry, I'll sort this out. What if I slip you a few notes to solve this? Or several. Excuse me. The Diaz family, please. We can also do a bank transfer. She was rather rude, right? Why don't we go somewhere else? No. Don't worry. This place is great. It's worth it. The main thing is we're all together. It wouldn't be Mother's Day if we weren't waiting for hours in a restaurant. Exactly. What a stunning bracelet! It is, right? It's beautiful. Francisco bought it for me for Mother's Day. Just a little gift. What's that bracelet about? Didn't we agree you'd save money? She bought it for herself. And that was nothing. Last year she bought two bags. Hermès. One for daily use and another for spare. Well, at least the bracelet can be sold. What worries me is that at Lalo's school everyone knows about the money. And about Jorge too. Rumors are flying about all over the place. Well, yes. Manuel was turned down for a job due to the situation. Maybe it wasn't just because of that. Maybe they saw his high school grades. I'm sorry to ask, but could you lend me 2,000 pesos? What for? I have to pay Lalo to keep him quiet. What? No, I'm not giving him anything. - Where is that kid? - What's up? - All right, darling? - What are you two talking about? Lidia was telling me about her job, right? - Yes. - I was giving her some advice. Okay. I was telling him about that episode of CSI that we watched yesterday. Wasn't it great? Dad, look, I'm not trying to be over-the-top but it's incredible how they find a killer from one hair! - What did you think? - Amazing. The Montes de Oca family? This way. It shouldn't be too much longer, right? No, not at all. - I love this song. - I hate this song. At Emilio's school, there were some morons who would sing it every year. They sung, recited, played it on the flute and did an experimental dance to it. It was like they were giving birth on stage. It was horrific. No, it was beautiful. Really? Did you like it? Well, I think it is beautiful. It sums up everything us mothers do for our kids. - Chatita. - Hello. Hello! That Chata is a weird one. Our kids would call her "Aunt Chata." And we've known each other since we went to Catholic school. Do you remember how before I went out with you, I'd chase after Chata? She's had tons of plastic surgery. Maybe she thinks I didn't make a reservation. That's why she didn't say hi. It must be because of that. Do you think so? It's great that you came, Emilio. It was going to be boring without you. Yes, I guess so. Sorry, I was pushed. - Emilio, you're acting weird. - I am weird. You should really take that into account. Ask my mom. She dropped me on my head as a baby. What? In preschool, I couldn't use scissors. No, he didn't hurt his head much. The Ledesma family. The Del Paso family. The Duque family. The San Martín family. The Urbina family. The San Román family. - It's us! - Finally. I'm going to enjoy my day. Enjoy the gifts, food, drinks... Denisse de Kalafe. Plus seeing my son's mother-in-law in that horrendous shawl. With my shawl on, I don't have to wait in restaurants. And how many tables before the García party of three? Ten. Here is your table. Next to the bathrooms? Isn't there another one? Of course, but you'd have to wait. No, we can all fit in here. It's perfect, thanks. You're welcome. - Sit here, Manuel. - Thanks. I know that you know. We're not going to pay you anything. - You're not? - No. My psychologist always tells me there are times in a man's life where you have to speak up to say how you feel. What are you doing? Sit down. Hey everyone, I just wanted to tell you... What did you want to say Lalito? My psychologist also says there are times where you have to hide your feelings so your enemy doesn't know what you're thinking. That I am really happy to be here celebrating my mommy. My sweetie, I love you. You have to keep your friends close but your enemies even closer. Do you accept bank transfers? I'll give you my account info later. Pablo, you can do it! - Hello. I'm Pablo. - Hello. And I'll be your waiter today. Dear God. There are nine of them. It's all good, Pablo. You can do this. Remember your training. Anything to drink? I'd like a mineral water with a shot of lemon juice on the side. A slice of lemon on the side? No, a glass of lemon juice. Lemonade? - No, a small shot glass... - Of tequila! - Lemon juice. - Do you want sangrita too? You know what? Just mineral water. Sorry, it's my first day and I've never waited on a table this big. Don't worry, kid. How about if we make it simpler and you bring out a bottle of champagne for everyone? - Yes! - Plus a lemonade for the boy. Mommy! Do you think one bottle is enough? You're right, there are a lot of us. It won't be enough. Bring one out and keep one on ice, please. - Okay. - Thanks. - Champagne. - Which one? The best one you've got. We're going to drink champagne? - Yes. - No. No, it's really dry, right? You love it, honey. You always drink it. Yes, but it gives me heartburn. - Since when? - Since forever. So should I bring it out or not? Why don't we get a soda so the kid can drink too? - A ginger ale. - Exactly. Francisco, I always order champagne on Mother's Day, my love. This time is going to be no exception. - Champagne for everyone. - Yes. The best one. I'll be back shortly. Bring the best one, but really the cheapest. I don't know if we have that, but I'll ask. Honey. Lidia. This is for you, Mom. Really? What could it be? I'm so curious to find out. - I hope you like it. - How lovely. A keepsake from the wedding. The one they didn't invite us to. Do you like it, Mom? Of course, it's wonderful. I'll have to change the frame later. My God. - What a shame! Such a lovely present! - Is everyone okay? Stay seated. This is a danger zone. I'll sort it out. I hope that's not bad luck. I want your therapist's number now. I'll send it with my account details. The fish for 100 pesos sounds good. It has three zeros. - It's 1,000 pesos. - 1,000 pesos? It's too expensive. They inflate the prices. Sofi, don't be like that. I'll just fill up on a salad then. No, please. Don't worry. Order what you like. - This is on us. - No. How could we accept that? We can split the bill. No. Of course not. The meal is on us. If they want to pay, let them. Don't be like that, Lidia. - We can all chip in. - No. No, not that. Don't be like you were with the condo we lovingly picked for you. - We've already talked about that. - Exactly. We have to get things on our own. Yes, I get that, but this is not an apartment. This is my party and we invited you, so I don't want to hear any more on it. Cheers. - In that case, I'll order lobster. - No, Emilio. - Emilio, order... - Yes, yes. What a great idea. Lobster for everyone, please. - Thanks. - That's too much. You saw a lovely salad, Jaime? That's best for Sofi, she is a vegetarian. How nice that you remembered. I am irresistible. How's the job hunt, Manuel? It's tough. They're not hiring anyone at the moment. Your dad could get you a job with one of his friends. Right, my love? It's better if Manuel gets a job on his own. I fully agree. Absolutely. Yes, that's why I want to set up a business. Me too! So you're... Are you okay? What do you think about a craft beer business? Great idea. We could do with a beer that doesn't taste of piss or misery. - Has anyone seen CSI: Miami? - Look, my love, if you want to sell beer, we will support you. What do you think, Dad? - Great. - It's great isn't it? This is my plan. - I planned to... - Speech! The moms should give a speech. - Yes! - Go on, Mom! Mom, say something. Go ahead, Mom. Well, then... Being a mom is a really exciting thing. However, today I want to celebrate all the single moms out there. As they face the biggest struggle. Although their reward is not having a husband. As marriage is... What would you say, Sofi? A patriarchal invention to control women. - Exactly. - Created from a need to control the land and herds. - It has nothing to do with love. - See? Even worse! What Sofi said. So... Here's to all of the single moms. To those without husbands. Well, being a mom brings you lots of grief but also love. It's the greatest love a woman can give. Seeing you here all together, I want to tell you that I'm so proud of you all. Of all you have achieved. Of how we trust in one another and how Francisco built us a solid home. Everything was going well in business but it started to go downhill when I thought, "You deserve it. "You deserve to live the high life." When I hired that life coach, that's when everything got so much worse. This family is the only thing I need. Dad, what's wrong? Nothing. It was a lovely speech. We should all remember it in the future. The near future. It moves me seeing Francisco tear up. I've not seen him cry since he found out that Mocedades was changing its name to El Consorcio. Or maybe when Joan Sebastian died. Or perhaps Diego Verdaguer? Or both? When the group Garibaldi split up. No, recently when Queen Elizabeth died. Poor thing. He always said he felt she was like his grandma. - Let's take a photo. - Yes! But the lobsters will get cold ma'am. I don't know if lobsters get cold. - It'll be super quick. Thanks. - Yes. Sofi, come here my darling. Say cheese! - Done? - No. Try to smile more with your eyes. Again, one more. That's it. I like that one, it's more arty. Can I see, please? Look, my love. Chatita! Go fuck yourselves, assholes. Holy shit! I'm lucky I didn't marry Chata. Take the shirt off so we can rinse it. No, how can I? Why not? We're all friends here. If you want I'll take my dress off. - No, Mom. - No. That's not necessary. - Why did she do it? - I don't understand why. How rude! Wasn't she your friend? Yes, since forever. We've traveled together. Her husband always asks Francisco for business advice. Well, Mother's Day is a really stressful day for some mothers. What's up, Dad? What is it, Son? That was really strange. Chata is crazy but she's never that crazy. Your mom didn't give her back an oven dish. Must be that. They'll sort things out. You heard what I said about the beer, right? Yes. It's an excellent idea. Okay, yes. What I wanted to talk to you about... was going into business with me. You know, father and son. San Román beer. The logo? The family crest. What do you say? No. No! No. No, Son. No. - Okay. - I can't explain it right now. Okay. No problem. It's because of Lidia, right? I don't want any problems with her. I'll explain tomorrow. You'll understand it better then. Sure, Dad. Yes. Yes, sure I will. Right? Haven't you seen how she looks at me? In a normal way, Emilio. When she passed me the bread, didn't you sense the sexual tension? The what? The sexual tension. The truth is, I wasn't really paying attention. I can tell you know nothing about these things. Well, I won over your mom. Don't make jokes about that. When are you going to surprise her? I don't think I will. Why not? She'd love it. I know women. If you say so. Sofi, will you trade your salad for my lobster? Obviously not. I'll give you 2,000 pesos. - You don't have 2,000 pesos. - I do. Well, not yet. But when they pay me off for keeping Dad's secret... What secret? My psychologist also tells me there are moments in a man's life where you screw up. Done! - All done. - Let's see... Thank you. Is it okay? It's fine. No, I can't go out like this. - It looks fine. Right, Lidia? - Yes. If you focus on it, you can see it, but otherwise you wouldn't notice. God. Well, I know how we can resolve this. Look. Thank you very much but... it doesn't go with what I'm wearing. How does it not? That green is the same as that one. Plus, it looks better than the stain. Really? It looks great. Fine then. - Shall we go back to the table? - Yes. Let's go. What is going on? Nothing. Why? You can't fool me! It's about your mother-in-law. - No! - Lidia. I know you as if I gave birth to you. - You did. - That's how I know. Francisco lost all of his money and the family is bankrupt, Mom. I had to tell someone. I couldn't keep hiding it. You can't tell anyone. - Esmeralda doesn't know. - How do you know? Because Francisco told me. Lidia García, you helped a man deceive his wife and his whole family? - No. - I didn't bring you up to be like that. I brought you up to never tell lies. And to be in solidarity with other women. I just helped you lie to Jaime. A woman. Solidarity? Mother's Day. You get three points. Don't tell anyone. Please. My love. My love. In the mood for a quickie right now? Just wait for my mom to come out. You told my dad not to go into business with me. - No. I didn't say anything. - Lidia! They're releasing new episodes of CSI with the original cast. Hang on, hang on. Wait. Do you think I'm the same as I was in college? A rich kid who only knows how to ask his Dad for money? Well, you did just ask your dad for money. Yes, because I want to set up a business. I don't like it, Lidia. I don't like that you pay for everything. - Manuel, I don't care about that. - Of course! Of course you don't, because you have a job. But it doesn't stop your class resentment for my family for having more money than yours. No. No. I didn't mean that. Honey. Sweetie! Class resentment. What happened to your lobster? I didn't like it. I switched with Sofi. It was delicious. That's because you haven't tried tlayuda. How's everything? All good? Everything is perfect, thanks. I'm making sure that lady keeps her distance. Don't worry. Hello? Yes? Where? Where's your salad, Sofi? No, don't worry. Lalo will give it back right now. No I won't. I just never appreciated what I have. Don't worry, I've gotten used to it. - Daddy, forgive me. - What's going on? - I don't know. - Lidia... I'm sorry. Don't get mad at me, okay? - What did you do? - He opened my eyes. Can anyone explain what's going on? Everything is fine, darling. Don't you think Law & Order is really similar to CSI? Daddy, sorry for not helping you. Sorry for asking for that expensive vegan protein. I'll return it tomorrow. Darling, your dad loves to spend money on you guys. Tell her, Francisco. Tell her. I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you this here. - I have no choice. - Tell us what? Happy Mother's Day, Rosita! Dad. Tell us what? I can't do it with the mariachi band here. Afterwards... Tell them to be quiet. Tell them to stop! Dad! We're broke! Holy Mother of God! Don't go crying to mother! The mother of all disasters. Motherfucker! We don't have anything. What are you talking about? Jorge stole all of our money. Plus the investors' money. Francisco, don't make jokes like that please. They're not funny. It's not a joke. He is in the Bahamas. I've not spoken to him since Christmas. - How come? - That's when I found out. And now you decide to tell us? I didn't want to worry you. This must be some kind of mistake. Surely we can fix it. Lidia already looked. You knew? And you didn't tell me? Esmeralda! Wait! Rosita, I know this isn't the best moment but... I suspect this is not the best moment either. Also, I have to go out for a minute. - Where are you going? - I'm going to... Moscow, Hong Kong, Afghanistan. Anywhere was better than being there. Especially as there was someone who needed me. Sorry, sorry. Excuse me. Esmeralda! I have to get out of here. Okay, well. Let's go then. I'll introduce you to my third child. Dad? Your mom left her bag. She never goes out without it. This is her hand sanitizer. It's ringing. No... Her cell phone. The last time Mom went out without her phone was... The only time. She got drunk. Really drunk. She became a monster. Don't exaggerate, Dad. She lost the van and her jewelry. She disappeared for three days. She got arrested at the San Marcos fair. She lost everything! That's when I started stealing. - "When I started stealing" - Ouch! Hey! Don't worry. That won't happen. What? Manuel! What a lovely car. It's really... really alternative. You can say it's a mess, I don't care. How can you think that? I lent it to Emilio. As you can see, he never takes care of anything. Never ever. The good thing is you've got everything with you. Emilio makes money recycling bottles. Very soon I will have to learn to do those kinds of things. You're so dramatic! You could live off that bracelet for a year. If you want, I can teach you. I don't mind at all. If you're genuinely asking me if I want you to, no I don't. Okay, don't think about that now. Buckle up and think about where you want to go. I'd like to go somewhere where no one will find me. Okay. Preferably somewhere not too crowded - that sells alcohol. - Okay, yes. I don't want to see anyone I know. I have the perfect place. My God. What was that? What happened? Nothing. Don't worry about it. It's the third time I've swiped it and it's not working. It's the start of the end. - What? - Are we poor dad? Is it official? I don't care but someone has to pay the bill. - Do you take metro cards? - I'll pay for it. You're not paying. It's not your problem. - Why not? - It's my family's problem. Your family is my family. That became clear - when my dad trusted you over me. - Let's go... Remember what we promised at Christmas? We promised we wouldn't have secrets. - It was Christmas. - No, no! Lidia. No one can talk about Christmas. - Right now... - This isn't the time. Sofía, stay out of it. This is your fault. Why's it my fault? Lalo told me. Lalo, stay out of it. It's your fault. At least we agree on that. Why is it my fault? Don't talk to me. I'm sick of your shit. The most important thing is to find Esmeralda. Rosita too, she's not picking up. Plus, you must pay the bill. I'm going to pay the bill. Come on, baby! Come on! - Come on, baby! - Rosa, sorry to interrupt but why not get a new car? - What? - No, it works perfectly well. Plus, I couldn't anyway. This car belonged to my deceased husband. It's like family. It's as if you were to ask why I don't sell Emilio? I've thought about it at times, trust me. Okay, let's go. It's just, he gets really nervous. - The car? - Yes. You don't like us not having faith in you, right, sweetheart? Let's get out of here. Let's go. THE QUEEN You won't see anyone you know in here. No, that's for sure. I used to come here with the father of my children. Nothing has changed. I think they used to come here too. Well, it's very quaint. Esmeralda, don't start. "Well, it's very quaint." If you don't tell me exactly what you're thinking, I'll leave you to find your own way back. I hate it. It's horrendous. I don't understand what type of person would come to a place like this. People like you and me. Well done. You're doing really well! That... warrants a beer. I screwed up big time, didn't I? I shouldn't have said anything. It's fine. It's never good to keep those kinds of things in. You're right. Things should be said. Will you tell me why you've been avoiding me? Now isn't the time for us to talk about that. What's important now is our moms. Right. I don't know what I'd do without you, Emilio. A flower for two moms to celebrate your day! How'd you know we're moms? Well... - Because you look like moms. - Give that flower back. That man is insulting us. - He's saying we look old. - No, no, no. Sorry, ladies. It wasn't like that. I just want - you to have a nice day. - Well then, in that case, the least we deserve is a free beer. Yes. Two. - These things happen. - Come back soon. - See you later. - Thank you. Sorry. Hopefully there'll be another opportunity. - Whenever you like. - Please, just leave. I mean it. Go, now. Thanks for the tip. Where are you off to, Francisco? To the exit. Everyone's leaving. - No, this guy isn't going anywhere. - How's it going, Alan? Who is he? My dentist. You ruined me, you son of a bitch. I am also bankrupt. - No! - No! Lalo! - Damn bastard! - Lalo, wait! Lalo, please! Don't hurt my husband. Lalo, enough! Stop it! Calm down. Alan, please. We can resolve this. Your dad is a son of a bitch. Okay, we can't work it out. Hey! Lunch is on us. With what money? - Don't know. - They called us. Here comes Rodrigo, my gastroenterologist. Another one? You'll pay for this! Where's my money? Give it back! - Lalo! - Sir, no! - Let go of him. - Stay out of this. Jaime, this is your moment. - No. What? - Wait. Many people believe my muscles and skills come from jiujitsu or kung fu. The truth is, they're from the rehearsals I had to do each year to take part in the Guelaguetza. That's what I call training! Wow! But physical violence isn't an option. As my fellow countryman Benito Juárez said, "Respect for the rights of others is peace." You have to speak with a nice tone of voice. What a load of bullshit! That's enough! Everyone calm down! It's over! Mind your own business! Wow! Jaime! I hate Mother's Day! What am I going to live off of? I'm sure you're good at something. You studied at Cordon Bleu. I flunked out. I wish I were more like you. Determined. Able to survive anything. Thanks. But it wasn't always like that. It wasn't? When José Luis died, I had to make a real effort. I had to fight. I'm sure that you'll be able to do that too. Thanks. But we didn't come here to be sad, right? Tequila! Bottoms up! Your mom will be fine. My mom will take care of her. - So my mom can't do it alone? - You think I said that? - It's what you think. - No. - I didn't mean that. - It's fine. Hey! Hey! Hey! Don't argue in front of the kids. Let's see. Great! A shot of tequila for every bad gift we have ever been given on Mother's Day. Once Emilio gave me a frame made out of spaghetti. - How cute! - No, it wasn't cute. Plus, he forgot to finish it so I had to. Your turn. - I can't think of anything. - I'll help you. Lidia. How could she think it was a good idea to give us a wedding photo? What? You mean, she gave you one too? - That was indeed a terrible gift. - Yes, it was. It's a shitty day. Right? Cheers. Cheers. We have to find Esmeralda. - No, Dad. Calm down. - We'll find her. She's with my mother-in-law. No, then we have to find her! - Enough! - Ouch! Wow! What security system do you have? To be honest, I've no idea. Tech Net's Smart Security A-25. - Version 2.0? - 3.0. - How many cameras? - Ten. - Where are they situated? - Follow me. Come on. I want to show you something. - Wait. - Come on. Just come with me. What if Esmeralda never comes back? Don't worry, she'll be back soon. Let's go sit down. Cheers! - I beat you. - Mother's Day was created to torture us. All those years of horrendous recitals, papier mâché costumes which they made the night before... You know what? Once we waited for three hours to see Manuel's group dance. They finally came out. Manuel danced for five seconds, then threw himself onto the floor. He didn't know the routine! I've no idea why he's my favorite. That's why I don't have favorites. - Really? - Lidia is annoying as hell, as you know. And Emilio... He's fine as long as he doesn't end up in jail. Don't say that! Hello? Testing, testing... Good afternoon. - Hello. - Hello. We're dedicating the next song to all of the mothers out there, who have our hearts, especially today, on their day. This song goes more or less like this... THE QUEEN To you who gave me your life - No! - How lovely! - Not this damn song again! - I love this song! Denisse de Kalafe has other hits besides this. - Really? - Yes. - Tell him. - Which ones? Yes. Cheers to Denisse de Kalafe! Wait. Now, let's see... Please, sir. Sing us something else. Denisse de Kalafe has other songs, you know? - Really? - Yes! She did Love Is So Strange, Love Me More, Damned Heart. Don't you know them? Sorry, ma'am, but we don't take requests. You don't? Well then... - Excuse me. - No, ma'am. - It's Mother's Day, right? - Yes. I'm a mom and I can do what the hell I like. - Yes, you can! - Yeah! The monster. - Ouch! Now what? - I don't know. This is my bedroom. It's lovely, but it's best we go downstairs. I have something for you but I don't know if I should give it to you. Don't give me anything. Did you do these? This one is for you. Ramiro! You don't deserve it since you've been acting so weird. - Do you like it? - I love it. Ramiro looks so handsome! You've captured his rebellious look. You don't look bad either. Thanks, Sofi. Emilio! So from here you control everything? Or from my cell phone. Wow! I can also control the cameras so they point wherever I want. - How clever! - I have to be smart. Now that we don't have any money, my future is in crime. Lalo, why are you saying that? I try to behave but I just can't seem to. Today I blackmailed three different people. - And it's still early. - Well... You have potential to be a cop. - Seriously? - Not one of the bad ones. One of the honest ones. You won't earn much but you'll learn a lot. Is that where you learnt how to fight that guy? No, an old lady in my building taught me that once. Tenant meetings can get really intense. Lies, it was all a lie The kisses, the roses, The fake caresses That made me tremble Lord, you are in Heaven And you are so kind Clear all traces Of his fingers on my skin He lied to me He lied to me He lied to me He lied to me! He lied to you. If anyone had told me I'd have this much fun with you, I'd have told them to take a hike! I used to be the life and soul of the party. Tons of guys wanted to date me. Even Francisco's business partners used to flirt with me. I never cheated on him! What an idiot! Hey, play another tune. Can I at least sing this time? Only the choruses and not too loudly. I'm looking for Esmeralda. No, it's Francisco, her husband. You don't know where she could have gone? Wrap this arm around the neck and put your hand here for leverage. Here and squeeze. Wait! Wait! - Be careful. - Sorry. Are you okay, Jaime? - Are you okay? - You learn fast. Emilio, what's going on? I can't get any water out. Something's up and it's not right you won't tell me. I'm just dehydrated. Emilio, we can't carry on like this. Tell me what's going on or else we won't speak again. Sofi, I think you're a beautiful girl. You're great and really smart. Ramiro really loves you. You can tell from how he gets when you go to visit him. Yes, I love him too. - But I still don't understand. - Sofía... I have never met anyone as incredible as you, who understands me this well. What are you trying to tell me? I know you're in love with me and I don't blame you. But we can't be together. Emilio, you know that I'm gay, right? Who will care about this end? To you who has somebody waiting for After me Who will you tell that I cried For you? Excuse me, moms. No, I mean ladies. - Can you stop singing please? - Why? We've received complaints. From who? There's no one here. It was you, right? If you have something to say to us, say it to our faces. No, Esme. It's best we go. We've been thrown out of better places. - Give me the bill. - Let's go. Let's go. We're leaving. Let's see. Gee. Where is my purse? I don't know where I left it. Well... I didn't bring my purse because Manuel said you were paying for lunch. So how are we going to pay for this? How good are you at running in heels? - I don't know. - Let's go! No, ma'am. No! Don't worry. - Wait for me! - Ma'am, no! No! No! No! Esme! - Esme, are you okay? - Yes, yes. But tomorrow this is going to hurt. Let's run! Wait for me! Let me in. I've never done anything like that. Esme, you haven't lived! You've got to be kidding. - Motherfucker. - Motherfucker. Don't worry, we've just got to warm it up. Come on, baby, come on! Wait, I'm feeling queasy. How's it going, moms? I know we haven't spoken since the San Marcos fair incident but... I know, yes. I'm sorry. Do you remember where her little party started? Why didn't you tell me you were gay? You didn't tell me you were straight. True. You're right. This won't change things between us, will it? No. Quite the opposite. I need more diverse friends. I've always wanted diverse friends but I don't know why they've always stayed away from me. There was Squinty, Albino, Lazy Eye, Hunchback, and Darky. Sorry, kids. I can't wait any longer. I have to go and look for Esmeralda. Where are you going to look? I don't know. Anywhere. I'm really worried. I doubt anyone will call me to tell me where she is. - Wait. - Jaime... My arm! Sebas. We've have two drunk women in our patrol car. They tried to leave without paying. One says she knows you. What kind of depraved person arrests two mothers on Mother's Day? - What would Denisse de Kalafe say? - Who? - Moron! - Moron! Jaime has found them! - Really? - They just told me their whereabouts. - His police contacts. - What? I have no contacts in the police. What happened was, for years I had a stall selling products from Oaxaca. I sold tasajo, quesillo, fava beans... And that business helped me form great connections. - Where are they? - Come on, I'll explain on the way. Jaime is the most incredible person I've ever met! Let's go. Kids, - keep chatting. - We've found them. We're going to get them now. - Take care of your brother. Come on! - Man! Not only did Francisco lie to me but my kids did too. Yes, especially Lidia. I have to apologize for that. They all thought I couldn't handle the news. Well, that's actually quite nice. - They wanted to protect you. - No. - They underestimate me. - No. But not you, nor anyone else! Do you want us to get you a coffee or something while we wait? No, thanks though. It's best you take us to the station. Did you hear that? She doesn't know what she's saying. We'd like the coffee instead. I don't want to see that asshole. I think we should've turned around back there. Now you know more than the GPS? - Enough, Manuel. - Why don't you drive? - It's your car. - It's not mine, it's ours. No, from now on we should split our things. Your car, my CSI seasons, your family, my family. Pull over. Stop the car. Do you feel sick? I'm feeling the effects of that lobster myself. Get out. - Get out, Son. - Okay. Lidia, may I remind you - that we have to pick up our moms. - Yes. I'm not moving until you listen to me. I'm stubborn. I swear I'm not moving. Okay, stay here then. Are you going to go off in my car and leave me all alone? Of course, your car. - I'm sorry. - I'll get an Uber. I didn't mean it like that. Listen to me. - I love you. - Me too but it has nothing to do with it. I love you and it has everything to do with it as I know you love your siblings, your mom and your dad. So if they ask me for a favor, I'll do it. As they are a part of you. But you should have told me - what was going on. - Yes, I know, I screwed up. Sorry, I wanted to resolve it by myself and it all backfired. Now I know we are a team. I swear I'll never forget that again, but stop making silly comments. We're not splitting anything. What's mine is yours and vice versa. And we can't split up now anyway because we haven't finished watching CSI. And I want to watch CSI with you for the rest of my life, Manuel. If you'd like that. I can't forgive you, Lidia. I can't forgive you right now anyway. But soon I'll remember all of the great things you've done for me and how much I love you. Who knows? Maybe an episode of CSI will change my mood. Because I love you. I love you more. Kids... That is lovely, but we have to go now. - Let's go get our moms. - Yes. He didn't tell me anything. What a jerk. My dad did the same thing. Said he was buying cigars, and took all our money. So you guys know what I mean. No. Here they come. No. - Esmeralda, I brought your bag. - Is this your husband? - Shall we take him to the station? - Yes, - take him. - No, that won't be necessary. He deserves it, but it's not necessary. You sit down. - How's it going, Sebas? - Jaime. Thanks so much. Rosita. You had me worried. Why did you run off? What do you mean why? Out of solidarity for Esme. I get that, but you left just when I was wanting to ask you something really important. No. No, no. - What I wanted to ask... - No, no, no! I can't. Forgive me, but I can't marry you. Rosita, there must have been some kind of mix-up. I didn't want to ask you to marry me. No? No. I just wanted to ask you to go on vacation with me. A vacation? No, my mom hates going on vacation, Jaime. She hates people. That's why I thought it'd be a good idea. Jaime, I'm so sorry! You and your son were making up stories in your heads. Ask me first, Rosita. Yes. I just want to tell you... that me not wanting to get married has nothing to do with you. It's because I don't know if I'm ready to get married. You should marry him. Jaime is a great catch. - Thank you, Sebas. - I'd marry him. - Me too. - Calm down now. Don't swarm him. Rosita, I don't need to get married to be happy. As long as we're together... Do you agree to go on vacation with me? I do. When I saw Jaime and Rosita hugging, love was in the air. Everything was perfect. That's when I decided to open up my heart to my beloved Esmeralda. For her to tell me how much she loves me. Esmeralda, I also want to say something to you. Francisco, go fuck yourself! See? She unleashed the monster. Pardon my French. Sorry... but he deserves it. Don't apologize on your special day. I want your things out of the house. I know you're worried about the money. No, Francisco. I'm not worried about the money. I'm worried because I'm married to a liar who thinks I am so weak that I can't adapt when things get tough. Rosita? - Can you give me a ride home? - Of course, Esme. - Let me see if I can start it up. - Wait, Rosita. I'll drive. All right. - Let's go. - You ride shotgun. Thanks, officers. Jaime, take care of them. Come on then. Everything will be fine, Mommy. I know, my love. I know. We'll never lie to you again. Lalo, don't set yourself impossible goals. But I will change, I swear! Because I'm going to be a cop. Well, at least one of us will have a job. We've lots of things we must pawn. What does pawn mean? You'll learn soon enough, my dear. Next year, if the economy improves, I'll give you a real gift. No, how can you say that? I love my coupons! You've just won yourself a free massage! Lucky me! Plus, I'll let you pick the movie. I always do! You put the movie on, I'll clear up. No, how come? Yes, it's your day. - First one there first gets to pick! - No! - Last time you did the same thing, Mom! - Come on, let's watch a film! Forgive me, Esmeralda. We will be fine. We'll get through this. I know, Francisco. I know we will. But not together. Esmeralda, I need to be here. With you. Do you know what the best Mother's Day gift would be? Time to myself. - Lalo! - Those are your things, Dad. - Lalo... Again! Pick it up! - Ouch! You see? Jeez. Sorry. Where am I going to live? You've started to like that. Sorry. There's no hot water. Why does he have to stay in our apartment, Manuel? Why? Okay, my love. I'm sure it'll just be for a few days. What did I learn this Mother's Day? To never tell lies to my darling hubby ever again. Never again. Hey, kids... Go ahead, carry on. Great isn't it? Spending quality time with my dad. Yeah, so cool! To appreciate what we have. To forgive. Everyone should learn to forgive. That I can get by alone. Yes! Female empowerment! High five! High five. Fist bump. That Denisse de Kalafe has other hits. And that we need a vacation. And that it doesn't have to be a day from hell. What? That everyone can live happily ever after. Yes! My favorite day is coming. The Day of the Dead. ARE YOU READY? So? Are we going to do this? What are you doing over there? Come closer. I'm in, partner. Poca told me he's in as a capital investor. What do you think, Sofi? - I'm in. - Yeah you are! Let's sell beer, guys! The Donkey Brewery! - I love it. - It's cool, right? - I love it too. - The name still needs work. We'll see.
