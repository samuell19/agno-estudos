'Darsakudu' [guitar playing] 'Dream!' 'Love!' [waves crashing] 'We can't achieve anything without dreaming.' [theme music playing] 'I thought my dream and love were two different tings.' 'But when I found out they were one and the same...' 'I lost both of them.' [waves crashing] [theme music playing] [guitar playing] [applause] 'This isn't the applause that I want.' [stones rustling] 'Director has created yet another sensation.' [indistinct news bulletin] 'This theatre is my childhood friend.' 'This is where my dreams were born.' [indistinct chatter] [panting] [theme music playing] [Guy] Who is this? Breaking the queue. [bell rings] [movie playing on screen] You bunk school and come running whenever there's a new release. Super! -Why don't you watch it from the gallery like everybody else? You're always in the projection room. This is how directors watch films. Action! [cheerful music playing] Super! Amazing! Hey! Jump! Come on, jump! [groaning] [crying] Hey! Stop crying, will you? I asked you to run, not fall. You ruined the whole shot. Go do it again. [thud sound] [crying] -Never mind. Take two. Look. He made my grandson stand under the sun shirtless. He's so tanned. He made him jump from up high. He broke his leg. My daughter is wounded on her birthday because of him. How can he be so crazy about films at this age? You should get him back on track. He went for a hill this time. He wants to shoot 'Titanic' next. He asked all the kids to gather by the river. They're just wounded because they fell on the ground. What if they fall into the river? Forget about our kids. We'll look after them. But your son is spoiled. Just look at him. I'm yelling here and he's shooting that as well. He can't be so crazy about movies. [pounding music playing] [Man] Where are you taking him? Will you beat him to death or what? You heard them, right? They're saying you're crazy. Crazy about movies. They say your life will be spoiled. It's not just them. Everyone in your life is going to say the same. They're going to yell, get angry and leave you behind. But remember one thing. You need to be crazy to achieve anything in life. You can't do anything otherwise. You want to be a director, right? In that case, everything you do should be about cinema. Whatever you do should be for cinema. No matter what people think or what you have to lose... Promise me you'll become a director. Promise me! [upbeat music playing] 6/3 Take 1. This is how you do it. Being fascinated by films isn't enough. You should be passionate. -What's passion, bro? What's passion, huh? Producer is here. I'll go meet him. Give me a minute. -Sure, bro. Sir... Sir... I have a nice story, sir. Give me 20 minutes of your time. Please, sir. I've been trying for so long. Please, sir. Just 20 minutes. Stop. Stop right there. Where's the co-director? Yeah, one second. He's behind me about some story. We'll discuss if he likes it. -Thank you, sir. [car engine revving] Yeah, tell me. So, you have a story, huh? -Yes, sir. How long have you been in the industry for? - 2 years, sir. 2 years into the field and you want to be a director already. I've been going through shit since 10 years. I couldn't do it. What makes you think you can? Sir... -Your short film, huh? 1000 likes, sir. -This has become a fashion these days. You make short films and approach for an offer. You ruin the film due to lack of experience and the Producer goes down for it. That is why this industry is headed towards destruction. [sighs] -Sir... Let's do something. Buy me a few drinks and we'll talk. [DJ playing] Ah, these lights, girls and music. Is he worth the costly bar, bro? He would've become a director if he was talented. He's a waste fellow, bro. -Hey! No one in this world is a waste. We should know how to use him for good. Let's see what he can do for us. Hello, sir. -Hello, sir. What'd you order? Come on, sir. Hey! Order chow chow for him. Chow chow? Is it chicken or mutton? Chicken, sir. -Why do you want to risk it? Why don't you order chicken 65? What are you waiting for? Narrate the story. One second, sir. Sir, this is the story of a passionate director like us. [theme music playing] And that's the climax, sir. How is it, sir? Kind of like your chow chow. I don't get it. -No, sir. It will be good. I don't think so. Audience won't understand. Reviews will be around 2 stars. You need to catch the audience's pulse. Take me for example. I recently narrated a story to our Producer. He was shocked. What was that shocking story, sir? You'll also be shocked if you hear it. -One second, sir. [recorder beeps] Tell me now, sir. Nothing much. As we open, there comes the banner and title. Villain's introduction... Fast cuts... Puri's style... As we cut... There comes the hero introduction and build up. Rajamouli style! We then cut to Sukumar. Why did he come in between, sir? -Second song in the love track, man. Sir! You forgot the first song. Hero's introduction is with the song. You continue, sir. There is a huge fight between the hero and the villain. A big blast... -Sir... Vinayak, isn't it? Are you the director or him? -It's me, sir. You stay quiet. You continue, sir. -What else? A twist and interval. Interval already? It's too fast, sir. -Audience will leave otherwise. I can't bear the tension, sir. Narrate the second half too. What happens next? Brahmanandam's comedy... You are superb, sir. I was just thinking about Srinu Vaitla and he is here. Carry on This guy is sharp. He will be a director soon. As we cut, there is a twist again and then the climax. Wow! Superb, sir. Your story has the entire industry But there is no story. What are you talking about, huh? There are two twists in the first half and two more in the second half. There is comedy in between and then the climax. This is enough. -Yeah, right. Rating will be 3. Cinema will be a super hit. Who the hell is he? -You shut up, man. Who is the hero in our story, sir? He just made his debut. His first film was a super hit. That Vizag guy... -Rakesh? Yeah. Him. Producer asked me to narrate the story. I am planning to go tomorrow morning. I don't like it, sir. -The story is alright, isn't it? I don't like that you are going tomorrow. -Why? Tomorrow is not auspicious, sir. Is it? -Go after two days. It's a good day. Your fate will turn around. -Is that so? I will be narrating a story for the first time. I will wait for the right time. -Sure, sir. [grunts] I will get going then. I'll keep this till then. [sighs] Look at him. He is so greedy. He took the leftover bottle with him. I thought drinks were a waste in his case and you're throwing in free advice. Hey... cheque please. He postponed it to day after tomorrow because I said so. So what? -I will go in his place and narrate the story. As the producer is ready to make that film with the hero... If we get him to agree to our story, project will be set. Pity on him. Swami might feel bad. You think his shitty line will be approved? -Not at all. Do you call that a story? I know, right? A chance will be missed unnecessarily. Anyway, direction is 20% creativity and 80% management. If we worry about someone else feeling bad, we will never get a chance. Cinema is important to me. I will do anything and also use anyone for cinema. You fooled him because he is stupid. What about the producer? [peppy music playing] What's your name? Whatever. Did you go in place of Swami to narrate the story? Ask him, sir. -I am asking. Don't get tensed Seems you also took my name as the producer. I can't even enter without referring your name, sir. You only said so in an interview... Me? What did I say? -That direction is 20% creativity and 80% management. That is why I went ahead. If I can't manage this, how can I direct our film later? [laughs] Swami, he is a great guy. Directors should have that attitude. Find out what happened there. By the way, what did the hero say? -He said okay. Hero said okay, Swami. What else do we need? Ask him about the story, sir. -Yeah, right Sit down. Sit. Narrate the story. This is the story of a passionate director like me. [sighs] As we open, a boy is running in a village. He went to a theatre and took a ticket from the counter. He went to the projection room instead of the gallery. [theme music playing] Nice. Very nice. Come on. Have tea. But something feels off. Were you ever in love? Not interested, sir. -That is why it feels off. Love track feels off. Set that right. We will go on floors. Have you fixed him? -Congrats, bro. Have you fixed him as the director? What does he even know? -The story is nice. Is the story enough? What about everything else? What else do we need? -Direction... and many other things. Everyone can't do it. He doesn't have the age or experience. What will he film? He will spoil it and then you will know. You are there, right? You have the experience. Supervise. You are the co-director -Bonus, huh? Suppose, I don't like your love track... What do we do? You tell me, sir. -Sell me your story. Swami will direct it. There's nothing wrong in it. You used my name. I will use your story 15 days time... Hero's dates won't be available again. [intense music playing] You worked so hard on the story and he said this. He is only asking me to change the love track. Not the whole story. -Oh... Only the love track? In that case, I'll shortlist 10 English films. I will come up with a good love track. You don't worry. You need to feel the love track. Not watch a movie. What a dialogue! I need to write it down. -Hey! Don't write down whatever you feel like Give me the voice recorder. Here you go. Do one thing. Feel the emotions and write a love track. I will put your name as the writer. -[gasps] Writer Kumar! Bro, you stick with this, I am telling you. Writer Kumar! -Bye, man. Don't worry. Take two days time. I will go visit dad. [sighs] First I should get the 'Writer Kumar' board done. I'm not getting any ideas. That's the matter, dad. If it's any other emotion, I can imagine. But it's a love track. I need to feel it. You know that I know nothing except films. You said I need to read some books and watch some films to be a filmmaker. But never told me about love. Why don't you give me some idea? You just smile at everything. I wish you were here, dad. Psst! Okay. Do one thing. Just bless me. Everything else will fall into place. . Next time, I will come here as a director. [melancholic music playing] Love you, dad. [indistinct chatter] Hey, director... -Uncle... You look great. -How long will you show me on this? Show me on the big screen -Sure. [phone buzzing] One second. I am getting a call. I will see you later Tell me. -I had a great dream while sleeping at the shoot. What is it? -I became a director before you did. [theme music playing] Sorry. [theme music continues] [Mahesh] Are you going to the railway station too? He dashed me first and now the enquiry. Waste fellow! [sighs] -He's asking for 300. Such a waste. Let's split? [Man] Okay. [indistinct chatter] -Hey, auto... We will split in threes. Okay? [theme music playing] [train announcement] Train is leaving. -Hey! [train announcement continues] Oh... It's delayed [thud sound] [upbeat music playing] Thanks. I gave your fare 100. -Oh. Sorry. I thought the train was leaving. Err... You hit him so hard for this? Pity! He is unable to get up. When did I hit him? -Huh? Do you know what happened? [upbeat music continues] [sighs] -You know it's so hard to hit like that. it happens only in the movies. You watch too many movies, right? Not at all. I hate movies, alright? Thief steals heroine's bag. Hero hits the thief. Heroine is quite impressed. Love starts... -Love?! [theme music playing] Hey, are you senseless? Do you think I will love you for this? Is love so cheap? -Didn't you like it? Shall we try something else? Shit! Hey... Why don't you say something? Hello, Miss Understanding.! What's your name? -Namrata, Age 24. Name is superb and so is the age. [gasps] I think she is here She is just wonderful. You stay on line. I will flatter her in 10 minutes. Namrata, 24. Am I right? -54. Oh! 54. What? Are you following me? [on phone] Just spoke to her. She's already cracking jokes. That's my berth. [train honking] [on phone] Guard just whistled. Train started slowly. She will fall with the jerk. I will catch her [metal creaking] She fell. Catch! [theme music playing] [on phone] She really fell, bro. Thanks. Will you let go now? Hey... Stop... Let go... Let go... [kid moaning] -Thanks. He was being too mischievous. He wants to stand at the door. -Relax. I will take care. If you stay quiet, I will tell a nice story. Story? It's boring -First listen to the story. If you don't like it, I will take you to the door. Okay? [Kids] Okay! [train honking] "Hey kids… I will tell you a new story" "If the story is bad, see what we will do" "Bah! Listen to me first. You will get to know" [music] "Once upon a time, there was a king" "He had seven children" "All of them together…" Umm... They did something. [Kids] Old story. We know it already. "Once upon a time, there was a king" 'He had seven sons" "All of them together…" "Must have gone for hunting" We were expecting Harry potter and you're talking about King and his sons. Who ever said sons? His daughters… Girls? It’s interesting. "All the girls went to shopping instead of hunting" "Girls always waste money on shopping" "They searched the world looking for a groom to their taste" "Poor girls… They might not have Google and Facebook" Who is the groom? Allu Arjun or Sunil? No. It’s the King’s era. They wanted the groom to be a warrior. Capable of swishing a sword on the house and killing 100 people. Oh… Magadheera? Yeah. But there is no budget. So, it’s Magadheera minus the graphics. [dramatic music playing] Green mat, boss. Not one by one, Sher Khan. I will marry seven girls at once. [laughs] I can’t even manage one. If you marry seven, you will end up in the woods. Oh no! There are lions in the woods, right? Nothing to fear. It’s all graphics. You guys narrate the story. What am I here for? Okay. You only tell us. "He won over the lion with the help of graphics" "All the Princesses proposed to him" [cheering] What did Magadheera do? -There's always graphics, right? "He made the seven Princesses into one through graphics" "He married her and returned to his kingdom" "Once upon a time, there was a king" "He had seven daughters" "They married the hero and returned to the Kingdom" [humming] [train honking] No... No... Please... I will tell you later. Hey... Stop it. Nuisance! Sit down! -[whispers] Sit. Sit. What's in that story? He says there are graphics and then denies it. It's senseless. -Yeah. Most meaningless. There's no message too. -Obviously, no message. Hello... There need not be any message or meaning. Purpose is important. Whoa! What's the purpose in your story? Simple. I stopped all these kids from making noise. By the way, what do you do? Director... I make films [cheering] My direction is superb, isn't it? -They are kids. They know nothing about films. That is why they reacted like that. Oh. Do you know everything about films? -I do. Cinema is nothing but the work of 100 jobless people... Watched by 1000 other fools. Wow! You're right, ma'am. Cinema is cheap. Waste of money. Correct, bro. But the problem is, we need cinema news to read along with coffee. Cinema gossips to discuss over lunch. And a cinema show to watch with girlfriend. Finally, we can't go to bed without watching a film. [phone buzzing] Even our cellphones have cinema ring tones. Hang up. So brother, without cinema, there is no entertainment or excitement. Claps...! [applause] Entertainment, huh? A single guy beats up hundreds... Falls in love in a village and dances abroad... Most unnatural! -What's unnatural? It's natural to hit someone out of emotion. To show the impact of the emotion, we make him hit a few guys. [scoffs] -It's common for lovers to keep dreaming. We shoot aboard to portray the dreams beautifully. Cinema is an extension of natural emotions. My foot! You are right, ma'am. Everything is unnatural. Hmm. -Okay, bro. A small test for you. I will narrate some scenes from my movie. Tell me if they are natural or unnatural. If they are unnatural, I will quit making the film. Okay? -Okay. Ask me. As we open... [theme music playing] What? A guy and a girl meet so many times in an hour? Most unnatural! Quit making the film. How was that, ma'am? -Get lost! [train honking] [indistinct voice] [phone buzzing] Hey! -What, bro? Got the track? Yeah. It just got down the train. I will go get it. Okay. Come fast. I am waiting. -Shut up [serene music playing] [train honking] Why is the berth empty? Where did she go? It's been an hour. Where'd she go? [intense music playing] [phone buzzing] Hello... You were on Godavari Express. Compartment S2. Berth no 54, right? Yeah. It's me. Who are you? -It's me. The director. [sighs] It's you. It's you?! How do you know my number? You weren't on your berth since an hour. So I checked your bag. Found your diary in it and called. Why did you open my bag? "Attention passengers!" "If you see any suspicious people or bags, report to the police immediately." Understood? Where are you? I got down at a small station for water. Psst! I couldn't find water and the train left. -Oh god! Do you know how far I chased? -[laughing] I am in trouble and it seems funny to you, huh? No. You say movies are unnatural. But a film had the same scene. That is why I laughed. [sighs] Which film, dear? Jab We Met! Kareena Kapoor. 'Oh no! Stop!' 'Stop!' Oh, really? What does the hero do then? [indistinct yelling] Hmm. Understood. Which station? Hello. [cheerful music playing] [DDLJ theme music playing] What next? What's with the pose? -What's with the running? For this. [sighs] Do you know how tensed I was? Do I have to thank you? -You wanted to say it, which means you did Yeah, right -Did you find out when the next train is? Yeah. One passenger train stops at 4 in the evening tomorrow. Hmm. We only have one option. There is the highway straight up. Let's catch some vehicle. I have a doubt. Shall I ask? Of course. Go ahead. Suppose, if there was a guy in my place, would you help? I mean, there is no such scene in films. [theme music playing] Forget about me. Suppose, if I was in your place and you were in mine, would you help? It's okay. Tell me. If the scene is good, I will put it in the cinema. [theme music continues] Hmm? You are a director, right? -Yeah. What do you do? -What do you mean? Psst. You know. Dance master choreographs the songs. Fight master composes the action part. Cameraman shoots everything. If they do everything, what does a director do? Tell me. [mumbles] It's a weird doubt. What do I say? Is it a tough question? -What's that scar? Psst! Nothing. Why don't you get me something to eat? [song playing on radio] Who put the menu card here? You don't get anything from this. Tell me what you want Four roti... -Too many. Two would do. Next! One butter chicken... -He can't make it. Chicken curry. Next! One coke... -You can't get it here. Pineapple juice... Good for health. -And desert? You ordered so much. Finish eating them first. [snaps fingers] Hello. What? Order? Ma'am just did. Share it. Bah! I got hurt while playing the 'movie' game as a kid. Oh... Is that why you hate films so much? Not films. Filmmakers. Eat it. What? Bill? Girls should order and guys should pay the bill. Pay it. Okay. You only pay. [tyres screeching] [Guy] Hey! Get down! Move it! Hey, guys! This girl is smoking hot! Ah! She's killing me with her looks. Ask her if she's available. Hey, girl in the skirt! Give me your name, girl! Wow! Waste fellow! Stupid fellow! 'Anaganaga Oka Roju'... -What? Psst! That film has the same scene. [singing 'Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast' from 'Mohra'] Is it? Then go and hit them. Hit them? -Like the hero in that film does. [thud sounds] [yelling] [sighs] -Oh. Do they hit only in the movies? Nothing in real life? That is why I say movies are unnatural. What are they talking about, man? They are discussing the price, bro. What? Will you hit them? -Wait and see. [glass shatters] Who is the gang leader, bro? It's me -I need to talk for 5 minutes. Let's go. Hmm. Tell me. -Have you watched the film 'Arya'? So what? -Shall we exchange characters? Characters? -It will be good. Let's try. As we open, you brought a beautiful girl to the same place. I came along with 10 rogues and commented on her. What will you do then? Hey! I will smash your heads and break your legs. What do you think, huh? -But how? You are single and we are ten. Everyone faces these situations. Only when we think from the other perspective, you understand the pain. Oh... Sorry, bro. Does it hurt? You understand my pain, right? So, no comments. Here. Enjoy this. Hey! What happened? -Nothing. Let's go. Hey! I am really disappointed. Disappointed? Why? Rowdies flying in the air... Trees falling down.. I thought you would fight like in the movies. Fight for what? There's no such emotion between us. What emotion? Suppose, if my mom, sister, wife or at least lover were in your place... I would want to fight. Yeah, right. We are nothing to each other. No emotions! -I know, right? I don't know you and you don't... You know I am a director, right? I am Mahesh. -I am... Oi! Why don't you tell me your name? Nothing. You are Namrata, right? -[gasps] Mahesh... Mahesh’s wife is Namrata. I am Mahesh. You are Namrata. That is why you shy from saying your name and give strange looks. Right? Am I right? -Hmm. Yes. What did you say? Movies are unnatural? What do you say now? Alright... Shall we start from the beginning? Hi. I am Mahesh Namrata. [theme music playing] What do you do? -Costume designer. Hey. Hold on. Pink color skirt, Grey color top and green color coat. Three colors combination. Did you pair it up? Yeah. Is it good? -It's amazing! If you continue like this, you will be the no. 1 designer. [sighs] But my dad doesn't get that -What's wrong? He wants to get me married. He calls me for alliances with some excuse. Psst! I want to be a huge fashion designer . But I don't know what to do to convince him. What are you thinking about? -Nothing. Go on. It's nice. What's nice? I'm not narrating a story. What are you thinking? -What if the same issue was in my movie? Movie? Does it seem like a movie story to you? Will you put it in the film if it's nice? -No! Stop it. Are all the directors the same? Don't you have emotions at all? There was this bomb blast and a guy made it into a movie. Someone else did the same. [sighs] Too commercial! If I travel with you, you will make my life history into a movie. So, I cannot travel with you. Lift! Shoot well and get awards. Make nice films, okay? [laughs] Hey! What would you do if you were in this situation? Come on! Run! [laughs hysterically] [train honking in the distance] [tyres screeching] Guys, get her! Hey! Don't let her go. Catch her! [suspenseful music playing] Hey! Hey! This is yours. And that's mine. Yes! She's my property. Give me one kiss, please. [gasps] [upbeat music playing] [metal thud sound] [screams] [intense music playing] [metal thud sound] [groans] [thud sounds continue] You're so dead! Are you out of your senses? You get down from a train whenever. You don't check the car before getting in. Do You think of nothing but getting on and down? You would have been dead if I hadn’t come on time. Sorry. Why did you get the emotion to hit them anyway? Am I your mom, sister or wife? I am not your lover at least. No emotions are necessary to hit in that situation. It just has to be a person. Are you still angry? Sorry. It's all your fault. -Mine? Yeah. Yours. I told you about my problem and you saw it as a film story. What's wrong in that? -It's wrong... wrong... wrong! [brakes squeaking] It's not. Suppose, if you discuss this problem with a psychiatrist... He would look at you and your dad's psychology and then solve it. If you discuss it with a lawyer, he thinks from the legal side. What am I? Director. -I know, right? So, all I know is cinema. I was thinking about how to solve this problem if it were in my script. You got angry and got into the car. I am really sorry now. Did you find a solution for my problem in your script? Yeah. "Planning forever in the span of seconds" "I hear your love calling out for me" "This feeling is love" [vocalization] "What is this?" "My heart is a mania" "You made this heart pound" "This wind told me the secret I am in love with you" "I am dreaming with my eyes open" "The skies have reached out to the land" "I am floating around now" [vocalization] "Planning forever in the span of seconds" "I hear your love calling out for me" [music] [rapping] "I get forgetful every second" "Every second feels like the end" "How did I forget my words?"

"My heart is a mania" "You made this heart pound" "Planning forever in the span of seconds" "I hear your love calling out for me" "This feeling is love" Why are you laughing? -Nothing. There's something. Tell me. -No. You will feel bad. Psst! Bah, I will not. Tell me. In this situation, there would be a song in our movies. Song? What song? -Heroine is falling in love with the hero. Love? Why would she fall for him? She won't. She has to. Every girl has some qualities she admires in a guy. Whoa! What are those qualities? -For example... Powerful dress... Isn't my dress wonderful? Next? -Commitment! Being wholly committed. I committed to help you. And I am continuing to help. Then the muscle power. You just witnessed it Anything else? Umm... Finally, honesty. We've been travelling for so long. Have I taken advantage of you? You will just fall for it. -No. I didn't Didn't you? -No. 'She fought with me in the train. Missed the train and I helped.' 'Rowdies teased her and I warned them. They took her away.' 'I fought and saved her.' She should've fallen for me. What happened? Hey, Tell me the truth. You just played a song in your mind. -No. Not even a small montage? -[clicks tongue] Maybe... -Uh-huh. Please tell me the truth. -Bah! I promise. Why would I lie to you? -[sighs] Get down -What happened again? 20 more kilometers still. Let's go. This isn't our vehicle. They might find us. Get down. [door opens] [theme music playing] [mumbles] First and second scenes are all set. I missed something. Looks like you are disappointed I didn't fall in love. It's not about you falling in love. There is some fault with the screenplay. You and your screenplay! Bah! Think out of your movie world once. Auto... [auto engine rattling] Mr. Director... Fix your screenplay and call me. You have my number, right? Okay? Bye! Wow! Wonderful, bro! The train scene, heroine goes missing, fight in the restaurant. It has everything. Is it? Got you so excited? -Yeah. Tell me what happens in the next scene. -She has to fall in love definitely. I know, right? But she says she didn't. Is that what she said? As per our screenplay, she has to fall for you. That's what got me worried. Let's tell the producer she fell for you. He will be convinced. I have to be convinced first. -[sighs] Yeah, right. I don't know what went wrong. But something is off. [peppy music playing] Okay. Costume change. -[sighs] No... That dress is too tight. We tried it on yesterday. -[sighs] Audience will only like it tight. Don't I know what suits you? Go and get changed. -I will be a top heroine one day. You will definitely not be my costume designer. Alright. Go. [phone buzzing] Hey! That's my phone. Your turn to cry. Hello... Dad! Don't irritate me. I'm busy. Call you back. Definite! -What's definite? Today or tomorrow, it's definite. -I will kill you. Tell me what it is. You will definitely get married though you like it or not. I have a plan for dad not bringing up the wedding topic again. Really? What's the plan? For any problem to look smaller, create a bigger problem How? -Say you are in love and send a selfie of you two to your dad. [playful music playing] That is Namrata. Look how I fooled dad. Hmm. I see. Who is that guy anyways? -He is stupid. An idiot! Hey, idiot! How long? Got the love track? Have it. You just have a week's time. Will you direct it do you want me to? [intense music playing] One cigarette. Bro, you are smoking?! Damn! I am tensed. We don't even have a week. What's with that look on your face? Give me some idea. -I will not. He looks fine. Why don't you tell him? He must be really disturbed. There's no fun in the screenplay if I say it so soon. What screenplay? -He is a director. [gasps] Director? Hey... Stop! Please introduce me. Please... -Bah! First let our screenplay sit tight. -Let's go set it then. Not now -When do you say? Director has to struggle and go crazy. Then, it will be fun. What is that for? -We get good ideas after drinking. Is it? -Yeah. All the top directors drink. Really! You won't stop at a single scene until climax. Is it true? -Yeah. Have it. I just saw a Korean movie. Hero and heroine fought at first. -Hmm. Hero helped her after that. -And? Both fell in love as usual. Japanese movie, Hollywood movie, Bollywood movie... Even in Tollywood... Same screenplay but different scenes run from Akkineni to Nagarjuna. They fight, help each other and fall in love. Is it? Why is this happening to me? Something is missing. Third song is missing in the screenplay. [door creaking] [music] "This screenplay is playing around with me" "It has blasted my mind" "I missed the logic somewhere" "There is confusion in my brain" "Storyboard running from Savitri to Samantha is now broken" "Same story has given success to both Kanchana and Kajal" [vocalization] [glass breaks] What, bro? Your teaser seems like a love story. Narrate me your entire film. "She got angry when I touched in the first scene" "Thanked me when I saved her in the next scene" "A new scene had begun already" "There is some Hitchcock plan in her brain" "Script didn’t change. It wasn’t even a trendsetter" "Girl changed the character" "Even the teaser isn’t out" "Film is going to end at the interval" What? Film is ending at the interval? This new script is amazing, bro [music] What happened, bro? Reminded of your heroine? No… My heroine is really decent, boss. "I think of her in the shot gap" "It disturbs me for the next frame" "She says ‘rolling’ to the beat of my heart" "I say ‘Action!’ and she looks at me like I said ‘Cut!’" "Won’t I go crazy with this? I feel like killing love " "Looking at her being shy I get low though I am high on drinks" [glass breaks] He fell down. What is this screenplay? He himself doesn't have any clarity. [gasps] I need to clarify this immediately. [dialing] [phone ringing] Hello, Namrata... -Hello... I need to talk to you. Meet me at Chef's Garden tomorrow. [car engine rattling] [theme music playing] Why did you call me? Hmm... Haircut... Trimming... You look fresh. Is the screenplay set? Almost. -What? New dress? -I bought it yesterday. Is it nice? You are wearing it. It's amazing. Will you have coffee? -Hmm? Tea? -Hmm. Bearer, two coffee. You look good. When you smile like this... Also when you are shy like this... [sighs] And now... You look amazing. -[chuckles] Also good when you are doing this. Psst! [theme music playing] How's the tea? -Good. That's coffee. Hmm... Coffee's good. No doubt. You are in love with me. Whoa! Will you decide for yourself? Body language! Body language? What is it? You wore a new dress to meet me. I bought it because I liked it. Not for you. Is it? What about drinking coffee thinking it's tea? Tearing that packet and feeling shy? Does that mean I love you? Not at all! What about this? Being a girl, shouldn't I get ready? You left your mobile... [theme music playing] Hey! -What do you say about this? [serene music playing] Hey! What happened? -Psst! You found out. Oh... Because I found it out? Sorry. Why didn't you tell me before? Do you know how confused I was? Do you know how happy that confusion made me? So, confusing me makes you happy? -Hmm. You guys know nothing. Though we are in love, we act like we are not. How would you feel if I suddenly said I love you? Wouldn't you be excited? -Hmm. I missed that excitement. It's waste proposing to you now. There's no kick in it. Psst! You ruined it. Your feelings are quite new. Loving me and getting caught... Feeling jealous, being sad about not proposing... And making this puppy face... You look so cute. Say it again for me. What do I say? -What you said earlier. Repeat it as it is. Nah! -I want to hear it again. [kisses] You were too cute. Please say it again. I can't say it. How will I feel that emotion again? You will. You love me, right? Try and you will get it. Shall I give you a hint? Excitement... Missing me... Feel it. You will get it. Okay. I will say it. -Good. What did I say? Though we are in love, we act like we are not. How would you feel if I suddenly said I love you? You'd get emotional, right? No... No... No... I am not getting it. What's this? Hey, that... [on tape] 'What did I say?' 'Though we are in love, we act like we are not.' ‘How would you feel if I suddenly said I love you?’ So you asked me to repeat not because it was cute. But to record it, huh? You didn't ask me to come here out of love. But for a scene in your film, right? Hey, don't say that. I really love you [thud sound] -Hey! Is it broken? [melancholic music playing] Listen to me, Namrata. What I meant to... -You don't have to say anything. I get it. You don't love me. You just say it for the sake of your film. Am I right? Not just me. You can't love any girl. You can't love anything except cinema. Having a girl in your life is unnecessary. Love is unnecessary. Shall I tell you what your character is? You are still looking for emotions and scenes for your film right now. If I still love you after this, it's my mistake. Because loving you would be a waste. You can't feel my love. You can just see it. You are a director after all. I am sorry for loving you! One small request. Please don't use this in the film. This is my personal feeling. I can't watch it on screen. I will be deeply hurt. Goodbye! [dramatic music playing] [intense music playing] [dialing] Kumar, note it down urgently. I got a great interval bang. Feeling bad about missing the proposal... Key words are confusion, kick and build up. Saying everything with a puppy face. Heroine finally says he can't ever love anyone and leaves. Here comes the interval... I... N... T... E... [thud sound] [melancholic music playing] The punch is just great. I said she yells at him before the interval. Cancel that. She slaps him hard. Put the interval there. It will be great. Fix! [theme music playing] [instrumental music playing] [cameras flashing] M.C Creations film 'Darsakudu'! First shot! [clap sound] I thank the media for supporting us. Hey! Reduce the volume. [Producer] I've only produced films with star directors. I'm introducing a debut director for the first time. Come. Why are you standing away? Come here. Talk. Come on. Hey... It's your lover. -I don't know what to say. Thank you, sir -Not my lover. Director. [sighs] Hi to all. I am Anand. [indistinct voice] Why is he saying Anand? You said he is Mahesh He's so dead! Wait, I am coming. [door opens] Cut! Whom have you referred, Swami? Have you seen that walk? I wanted an angry walk and she is doing cat walk. How many times do I have to explain? That is why I didn't want Hindi girls. -But she's Marathi. How does it matter? -What does language has to do with her walk? Have you seen that dress? I can't even look at it. Did you select that? I wanted my heroine to look different. -Bro, let's do a rehearsal What's happening? -Just one rehearsal. Okay. Do it. -Thanks, bro. What is this, girl? We don't want cat walk. We want an angry walk. Give me bright expressions. Director is serious. Look angry. -Okay. Come fast. Done, bro. Action! [dramatic music playing] Bro, this is superb. She looks just like you said. Same expression... Same walking style... Look, bro. -Hey, what's your name? Telugu girl, bro. -Shut up Tell me what your name is. -Mahesh. Tell her, man. Yeah. It's Mahesh. What? Who are they? So, it's not your real name. You saw my name in the passenger list and said you are Mahesh. Is the story over? How did the interval turn out? It must be good. You would've met me otherwise. Want to make this a scene too? What are you waiting for? Ask him to Film me. You can catch all the expressions too. -Film her, bro. Expressions are great. She might leave. Who is he? Your assistant? Did you train him well? Just like you. [romantic music playing] [theme music playing] Bro, ask her. Ask her! Will you act as the heroine? -What?! Will you play the heroine? [gasps] -I was talking about her, bro I am looking for a heroine. Not a lover. Only I have to like my lover. But the heroine... Everyone has to like her. Heroines are of a different league. Look at that structure. Have you seen that complexion? As we put the lights on and shoot, industry will be shocked. Are you interested? -Yes, sir! Shall we do a photo shoot? -Okay, sir. Umm... Are you carrying a different dress? -No, sir. I didn't know. I didn't get it. Umm... One minute. Please help me. I will miss the chance. Please! Please! Please! Costumer, scissors please. [instrumental music playing] Costume is just amazing! No test shoot. You are selected. -[chuckles] [scoffs] Super, bro. Annapurna, take this chicken away. You are taking the chicken away and he is taking the heroine away. She has two hits and 20 millions of satellite business. He got a new girl. She is inexperienced and so is he. He will destroy everything. You will be left with nothing. Let it be. How can he shoot with someone he dislikes? Who is that girl anyway? Have your food. Please. You will do it well. You know my fit. I’ll look good in your clothes only. -I will not do it. I will also not let you go. Hmm. Understood. What did you understand? You are scared he might fall for my figure and skin tone. He is after all your lover. -Not my lover. Just a Director. I know him very well. He is a huge spider web. Go anywhere near him and you will definitely fall in love. I know... Any girl would fall for his words and behavior. I came out of it as I am strong. But you are not like that. Very sensitive! Suppose you love him and realize he doesn't love you, You can't take it. Listen to me. [door opens] It's you?! [serene music playing] I came for you, Namrata. Remember you said 'I love you' that day. I was happy my screenplay was set but... I couldn't feel your love. Since then, I feel I am missing something. I didn't understand what it was. It was quite tough. But when I saw you on set, I understood that I missed you. I am in love with you. I fell for you. Since that moment, I feel like I want you. You by my side. [gasping] I can't breathe, Namrata. I don't know what to do. It's true, Namrata. I can't let go even for a second. Love you, Namrata. What happened to you? I saw many people in love. For the first time, I am seeing someone so sincere. You are very lucky -Did you believe it? Why do you say that? He spoke his heart now. Look at his face. Feel that emotion. I feel like I'm falling for him. My foot! He is not just a director but also a huge actor. He saw my design yesterday. He wants me to be the costume designer. That is why he's showing off. Oh... Caught me? Why don't you do it? For our Sailu. Or for your profession. You have to start somewhere. Do it here -Okay. But not for her or my profession. I will do it for you. Don't get too excited. I know cinema is only important for you. You want the best in everything. As you are pleading me so much, I understand. I am the best. That is why I will do it. But on one condition. If you try using my emotions in the film, I will quit that very second and leave. Okay? Okay. [theme music playing] "I'll build the set with clouds in the sky" "I'll bend the rainbow and use is as a camera track" "I'll set the lighting with lightening" "I'll record sounds with thunder" "I'll work it out I'll break the trend" "I'll make a hit film no matter what" [vocalization] [music] [vocalization] "Whatever I say is action enough" "I'll say cut if you over act" "I respect a bonded script" "But I'll rewrite the whole scene on the spot" "I'll shoot if I'm in the mood" Pack up! Pack up?! "I'll pack up if I'm angry" "I'll put make up on the sun" "I'll turn it into the moon" "I'll work it out I'll break the trend" "I'll make a hit film no matter what" [vocalization] [music] One... Two... One... "I'll catch whatever people are hinting at" "I'll make it a montage in my film" "I'll copy whatever is good" "I'll say I'm inspired to sound cool" "I'll shoot 'n' number of takes" "I'll give my all-time best" "I'll watch all the old cassettes" "I'll catch the audience's pulse" "I'll work it out I'll break the trend" "I'll make a hit film no matter what" [vocalization] [thud sound] You used this scene for the interval, huh? Hey! Let's go, guys. [gasps] Hey Shahrukh Khan! Come here. Come here. Where's your director? There. Let's go, guys. [sighs] -Don't say a word. Hey! What are you doing here? -Damn! I'm caught. Why did you come? What are you doing at the shoot? -Hello, bro. Hello. -Tell him, sir. Do you know them? You wanted new faces, right? Rowdies. This is your work, huh? -Hmm. Super, Swami. You did great. They look very natural. First time you did something useful for our cinema. Annapurna, get boost for sir. Will you do it? -Yeah. Bro will use anyone for his passion. Have to learn a lot from him Just like you did at the restaurant. Same expressions. Okay? Bro... We did a mistake that day. Sorry. Sorry, sister-in-law Why are you over-acting? [indistinct chatter] Ready, take. Action! Hey... Get down! Cut! Why are you shy? Are you here for alliances? Huh? What? You did it that day. Maintain that attitude. Go do it. Hey! Do as told. It should be as it is. Go! Ready... Action! Hey, bro! The girl is just amazing. [chuckles] You idiot! Where's the attitude? Where's the attitude? What did I tell you to do, huh? Such a weirdo! You said something that day. Say it Hey, bro... The girl is damn hot. I know, right? -Yeah. I want the same attitude. Don't be nervous. Cool. Go do it. Action! Get down, guys! [doors open] The girl is damn hot. -[thud sound] Why are you hitting me, bro? I said it right. She is not the heroine. This girl is. If the look isn't right, I will blast the other cheek too. Do it properly. [crying] Don't cry. Looks worse. My mom never hit me. He is slapping so hard. Bro has a lot of passion. He hits hard. Passion? What's passion? I don't know. He keeps saying it on set. Do it properly now. He will break your jaw otherwise. Ready! You did some action in the restaurant, right? Swishing the knife... Someone also broke a beer bottle. Where is he? -He left to Mumbai. Oh... Bollywood, huh? -Yeah, bro You break this. -No! No! He will do it better, bro. I don't like him. I like you. You are breaking it. Show me. Are you pleading it? You need to hit it hard. I will break it hard. -Hey! Not now! Not now. During the take. Sure? -Sure. Confirmed? -Yeah Don't do it and I will break your head. Okay? Action! [grunts] Why didn't it break? He is dead in my hands. -We're going to be screwed. Run...! Hey! [wood creaking] Wow! What a touch it was! Our director loves his heroine you know. Love? My foot! Do you think that was out of love? Yeah. -Not a chance. Movie would be halted if something happens to you. That is why he did it. Don't feel too much. How can I not have any feelings? [sighs] Did you ever hug him? You would know if you did. That hug was just too good. I could control myself but if it were you... Will you shut up? I am not so weak like you. Touch, huh? No one is dying for his touch here. What is that excitement? I was thinking of him. Clap in! Camera! Action! Cut! Cut! What did I tell you? When he kisses you suddenly, you have to be shocked. Yeah. -You are smiling. I want that shock reaction. Okay? -Okay, sir. Confident, right? -Yes, sir. Get ready. Ready. One more. Clap in! -22/5, Take 2! Action! Cut! Cut! Clap in! Take 5! Action! Cut! Take 8! Take 11! Take 15! Take 20. Action! Cut! Sailu, come here! What did I tell you? You should be surprised when he kisses you suddenly. You should be a bit shocked Sir, I don't get it. You don't get it? [pounding music playing] Oh my god! This is the expression I need. Understood? Did you Film it? Look... I need the same reaction. Follow the same and you will get it. We should've cast your friend instead of you. Hey... You did really well. So natural! It was great. No, thanks. You will turn this into a scene again. I told you already. Don't play with my emotions. You still did it. Enough now! Okay. Bye. Hey! Mr. Swami, this scene is taking so long. Let's go to the next scene. The costumes lady left. You should plan everything beforehand. Costumes and me? Seriously? What do we do now? You must have thought of something. Tell me. We will do that. Let's do one thing. Pack up! Pack up?! He cancelled the shoot because of the costumes. Started writing a scene on set. Whole day went in vain. He also kissed the costume designer. Mm-hmm? -She got angry and left. I have been telling you he will destroy everything. You didn't listen to me. What will you do? Do something about him now. Call him. -Hmm. Let's talk. What happened to you? Why did you leave? The shooting was stopped because of you. -You know what he did. What did he do? He just did what a director would do for expressions. You felt it differently. What do you mean? -We felt him to be a director. And you a lover. -No. I didn't. [sighs] Okay. If you felt he was your lover, you wouldn't come for the shoot tomorrow. If you felt he was a director, you will come. Let's see. [theme music playing] I didn't think she would come back, sir. You better keep an eye on her. Don't know when she might leave. Ma'am, someone is here for you. Dad, when did you come? -Just now. If you got married like I said, your husband would get you many clothes. You would have to stitch them now. -It's called designing. It's the same. Nice... So much goes into making movies, huh? Our Sailu… -Yeah. She is the heroine. Who is that guy beside her? Hero? No… Director… Director? I have seen him somewhere. Hey… He is the guy from the photo, right? [sighs] Dad, one minute… -Hi, uncle. Did you just come from the village? How are you? It's me, uncle. Did you recognize me? I am from Kothapalli. Kothapalli? I am Anand Rao’s son. Oh… You would roam around with a camera, going crazy for films. You also got my daughter bruised one day. That’s you, right? -Yeah, uncle. So, you have finally become a director. Nice! You stood by your promise to your dad. Anand Rao would be so happy to witness this. That is why I made his name my screen name, uncle. Anand! Very nice… You have a test now. Test?! Come here. Find out who my daughter is. He recognized her. -I recognized her the first time only. 'What’s that scar?' -'Nothing' You knew her from before? What’s the delay, dear? He is a good guy. You like him too. I will go talk to him. -Dad, no… Don’t go. I will just talk once. I will come back, okay? Why are you stopping me? Didn’t I tell you? Look. Dear, it’s your birthday. I'll stay for a day and leave. No. Leave right now. [sighs] I told you not to be so stubborn. You stopped me from talking to him. Now, you are not letting me stay with you. What happened to you? -Nothing. You just leave. -What is it? Did you both fight? Did you say anything to him? You are already crazy. You must have said something. Nothing like that. Don’t eat my brain. -You are hiding something. Shall I go talk to him? No. I don’t like him. What? You only told me both of you are in love. That’s different. I understood. -What did you understand? [train honking] -That you like him a lot. Not at all. Can’t you understand? I said I understood. Sweetheart, don’t let him go. He is a really good guy. One of us. Put your ego aside and take care of him. Bye, sweetheart. [door bell rings] [door opens] Hey… What are you doing here? I was just thinking of you. Promise! -Stop over acting. So, you recognized me the first time itself. That is why you followed me in the name of love. Getting worried when I missed the train, fighting when someone kidnapped me... Yelling at me, pampering me… Didn’t you feel like telling me? Oh… You will be caught if you tell me, right? You will miss the love track in your film. What’s that smile? New scene? Got it? Tell me. -Happy birthday! Oh. You remember this too. Great… You also brought a cake. So, you already know I am coming. Planned a birthday scene for your film? -Hey… Nothing like that. It’s alright. Tell me. So, what’s next? If I cut the cake now, you will copy that, I mean, get inspired... And put it in your film, right? Come on. Okay. First shot. [clapping] What now? Do I cut the cake? I have to feed you the cake, huh? Have it. You record everything, right? Did you forget? Take your mobile. Film it. Take it out. Hey! -It’s okay. Don’t panic. Film me. Shall we go to the next scene? Okay. What do we do next? Ah! Party. Bottle. You planned well. [mumbles] Kumar is the one to blame. Okay. Let’s start. [bottle creaks] -Hey! Scene will be good. Heroine comes to hero’s place. She yells at him. Gets frustrated and finally drinks. Are you drinking for real? -Don’t worry. Scene is important for you. It has to come out well. Hmm. So, shoot carefully. Umm... Can you see me? Okay. Do I go back? Frame looks okay, right? Okay. Start. I am drinking for the first time. It is okay, right? You will look after me, right? [exhales sharply] -You will. I know. At least for your scene, you will. Okay. Action! Hey! -[coughs] How do you drink this? So bitter. It burns. Is that why you eat something on the side? What is it? -Munching. Yeah, right. Go get it. We have the cake. -I don’t want that bloody cake. Okay. One minute. [singing 'Sun Raha Hai Na Tu' from 'Aashiqui 2'] I think she is high. [singing continues] How’s the song? -Super! You know what it means? Oh… You don’t speak Hindi. That is why you didn’t want a Hindi heroine. I will tell you what it means. Sit down. [grunts] Okay, [singing 'Sun Raha Hai Na Tu' from 'Aashiqui 2'] Why do you care about the meaning anyway? Just feel the emotion. What is that? -Dry fruits. Dry fruits? Who eats dry fruits while drinking? Dumb! You might eat but I will not. Waste fellow! [sighs] Feed me. [theme music playing] Why does everyone say you are great... Smart... A top director... Even my dad asks me not to lose you. [exhales deeply] He's so innocent. He doesn't know a thing. But I know you are a big copycat. You can’t film a single scene without me. I casually lied about not falling for you. And you cried that your screenplay didn’t work out. Am I right? I felt sorry for you and said ‘I love you’. You used it for the interval. [coughs] Come close. If Sailu doesn’t catch the expressions, why would you kiss me? Huh? You copy scenes anyway. Now the expressions too? Didn’t I tell you? You are a big copycat. Go and tell my dad you are an idiot and a bad person. Also tell him you use people and play with their emotions. It’s my time to play with you now. Stop. What’s with that smile? You think I will fall for it? No chance! I will not fall for you. Never! [romantic music playing] [mumbles] I am a good girl. I look good. If I propose to someone, they would fly away with me. They wouldn’t think about movie and screenplay like you. Don’t lose me. You will have a good life. [theme music playing] [door opens] Hey, Swami. What's up? -The shoot was at 7. Do you remember? Manage for 10 minutes. I am coming. -Manage what? Look at him, sir. You didn’t listen to me all this while. Sir... -Look at him now. Sir, what actually happened was… -I cancelled the shoot. Come to the office. Let’s talk. -I told you not to trust him. Remember how you were when you came to me for a chance? I gave you a chance looking at your passion for cinema, thinking you will do wonders. What did you do? Huh? You cancelled the shoot for writing a scene on set. You later kissed a girl on set and cancelled the shoot because of costumes. And today, you were with the same girl. You missed the shoot. No, sir. -Don’t talk. Listen to me. Do you know what today is? Public holiday. Do you know why I had the shoot in spite of special permissions and extra payments? That scene should be completed by tomorrow evening. We can’t accommodate artists otherwise. It will take a month and the release will be delayed. You already know both my previous films are utter flops. No way I should take a risk with newbies but I still did. I invested all my assets on this film. If something goes wrong, my family will end up on the streets. I understand she is disturbing you. You are unable to shoot. Sir, that girl… -I don’t care what you two have. That’s personal. But I don’t want my film delayed because of that. You decide. Movie or her? If you want her... There are many here to make that movie. Sir, what’s your problem now? Scene should be completed by tomorrow, right? We should plan for that but not have this discussion. Do I choose this movie or her? It's a waste of time. Swami and Kumar, we have to finish that scene by tomorrow evening. Let’s plan. Sir, cinema is important to me. That’s my life. That’s my passion. I will not stop the film. Sir, if she is really your problem, fire her. You said you will talk to him. Did you? What do you want me to do now? -Don’t talk. Don’t you have that responsibility as a father? You asked me not to talk. -So, will you just leave? You said I am crazy. Shouldn’t you convince me? Bah! Bah! Bah! He is a good guy, dad. Also one of us. Psst! You know he really likes me. Don’t lose him, dad. -Alright. I will do something. Okay. Bye. [squeals] [car engine revving] [door opens] [door shuts] -Hey, Kumar. Sorry I am late. Got the costumes I asked for? Who is she? -New costume designer. New costume designer? What about me? Bro asked us to fire you. [melancholic music playing] Did you fire me? Hey. Just a small issue. We will talk in the evening. Go. Who is she? It’s none of your business, okay? Give this to Sailu. Go. I told you we will talk in the evening. Why are you creating a scene here? -Am I creating a scene? Is the shot ready? Hmm. I get it. I told you all my feelings when I was drunk. You will get no new feelings or emotions from me. That is why you are looking for new emotions. You get it, right? Please go. Hey! Go away. I cried only twice in my life. When I fell down and got hurt during childhood... And now. Because of you both the times. I tried hard to understand you and your passion no matter what you did. But you… -Right! You understand what I am, right? I am like this only. I have to complete the shoot. I don’t have time. Leave! Come on, Bobby. [intense music playing] [melancholic music playing] [pounding music playing] [thud sound] [transformer sparkling] [indistinct yelling] [melancholic music playing] Ambulance! -Namrata… Namrata… [ambulance siren wailing] Namrata… Namrata… [melancholic music continues] Sir, I will also go. -Don’t worry. They will take care. Doctor is here, right? -Yeah, bro. Oxygen cylinder? -They have it. Check everything once. -Okay, bro. You don’t worry. They will take care. Let’s go shoot. Is the shot ready? Bro… -I don’t have time. We have to shoot. Come on. [door shuts] [melancholic music playing] "Is this how blunt your heart is?" "Is it ever going to melt down?" "Is this what your friendship means?" "Does it last only for a moment?" "Is it ever going to blossom into love" "You gave me a heartbreak and made it your story" "You stand here like a question without an answer" [music] "Those dreams have become my breath" "They dive deep into my heart and hurt me" "You don't have a heart" "You can never love someone" "Your memories are bitter, they tend to linger" "Those moments we made together" "They remain in the dark like mere shadows" [music] Mixing is done. Titles are also ready. First copy will be ready by evening. -Okay. Mahesh… Come here. Buyers saw the rush. They are thrilled and ready to buy. You are happy, right? Yeah, but they are asking for an item song. I spoke to the music director. He will have the tune ready by evening. Lyrics are ready. Plan for the shoot tomorrow, okay? -No, sir. An item song won’t fit in our film. Whatever, they are asking for it. It’s business. I am telling you. Shoot it. -I will not, sir. Movie will be ruined. -Yeah? So what? I will be at loss. I am telling you. Shoot it Won’t you do it? -I am telling you movie will be ruined. Look… If you won’t do it, someone else will. I will not even put your title as the director. Think about it. I didn’t come to the industry for making a name, sir. I came to make films. I made the film like I wanted to. Movie will be ruined with the addition of an item song. I can’t spoil the film I made with love. -Mahesh! And about the name… I don’t care. If you put the name, they will take my name and say I did well. If you don’t, they will say “Who is he that did so well?” They will talk about me either way. That’s the impact of a director. Begin a director isn’t about the name. It's all about the cinema. Cinema is all about the director. Cinema is every director’s identity. I can’t spoil the film with the item song and lose my identity. I don’t need such a name. I will not film an item song, sir. Swami!!! Sir… -He says he will not film an item song. You do it. I will name you as the director. Well! I thought he was ruining the film but it’s you now. I was worried about this since the start. I thought his inexperience will ruin the film. He did good. But you are ruining it with your experience. Sir, I saw the film. It’s really good. Item song wouldn’t fit in. No, Swami. -What? We also came to the industry with passion. You became a producer and we became directors. That’s the only difference. What are you looking at? Cinema shouldn’t be ruined. If the cinema’s good, you will be good and in turn we will be good. For all of us to be good, cinema should run well. He was correct. He did great with the film. It’s really nice. An item song wouldn’t sit right. No item song. Fix! Swami… 'Few days later' [drums playing] Every scene was fresh. Superb! Blockbuster! Emotional dialogues are just wow. -Super hit! Great movie for such a low budget. Beautiful love story. Just great. Great direction. Excellent. -Direction was spell bounding. Director did great. Good movie. Who’s the director? And where is he? [on TV] 'Director is unseen!' 'Director is unseen!' True. Director of the recent super hit ‘Darsakudu’ is unseen. As usual, the entire industry was keen on him after such a hit. Top producers and heroes are eager to work with him. But the director responsible for such a sensation is unseen. Where is he? What’s the reason for this? Rumors say that his true love story is the idea behind the film. If that’s true, what’s the director’s love story? Who is his love? [melancholic music playing] Shall we go? Packed everything? -He didn't come, did he? I mean… I called many times. It’s not reachable. I am trying. -He will not come, dad. Cinema is over, right? He must be looking for a new story and new scenes. I know him. Don’t try anymore. [weeps] I really like him, dad. I worked with him so that I can be close to him. I thought he would go beyond the film for a second and love me. But he remained a director. [crying] -Namrata, calm down. I know he really likes you. Yes, dad. Very much. Let’s go. [melancholic music playing] You don’t worry, sweetheart. I am here for you Why don’t you say something? Yes, dear. Don’t over think this. Don’t worry. Wherever he is, I will get him to you. No need, dad. Leave it -Don’t say that. Ma’am, it’s said that ‘Darsakudu’ love story is yours. Is it true? -Movie is a super hit. What’s your reaction to that? Seems the director is your lover. Rumors say he left everything for you. What do you say to this? Tell us, ma’am -[yells] He is not my lover. He is not my lover. He is just a director. A passionate director who can only see scenes in people’s emotions. That’s all. [scoffs] If he is so passionate, why did he leave this field? That’s a publicity stunt. He wants identity as a director. He wants to be called a top director. Everyone has to talk about him. That is why he did all this. Our director is not someone who uses a girl for publicity. He is not so cheap. You know something? I asked him to film an item song. He said he'll not as it’s unnecessary for the film. My ego was hurt. I said I will not put his name as the director. He said his film is his identity and left. I got angry. -Is that why you didn’t put his name? True. It was out of anger at first. But after I watched the entire film, I felt he was right. This film is his identity. Everyone has to remember him through this film. That is why I didn’t put his name. I made many films earlier and earned a lot. But I never got such fame. I earned respect in the society as a tasteful producer. But everyone is cursing me for not putting his name. There is applause for him in that cursing. And that gives me a lot of happiness. He is really a great passionate director. I love him. -I hate him. I wouldn’t call him my lover. He didn’t give a damn when I was on the verge of death. He didn’t even visit me once. Cinema is much important than people to him. He is not my lover. He is just a director. I hate him! [melancholic music playing] Hello, ma'am. How are you? I saw you talking to the media. You said you hate him. You're right. I too hate him. When you were being taken in the ambulance that day, he went to shoot. Shame on him! Is he even human? I was disgusted by him. I never wanted to see his face in my life again. I went places. But I couldn't control my anger. So I went to question him. Hey, Kumar. Where were you? You just disappeared. Why are you like that? Any problem? Tell me. I hate you, bro. I don't like you. I would be inspired looking at your passion as a director. I wanted to be as passionate as you. I wanted to think like you. But, no. One shouldn't think like you at all. You have no emotions. When she was on the verge of death, you left to shoot. [scoffs] What is passion without emotion? It's worthless. Bye. Hey! Do you know what passion is? Passion just doesn't mean loving one thing. It means being able to do love. You say I have no emotions. Can I become a director without emotions? I am emotional than you all who talk about emotions. Do you know how much I like her? Do you know how much I love her? I am a director. I feel my creations are the best. But after I met her, I couldn't create anything beyond her. Always thinking about her, the way she talks, expresses, walks... I would follow her crazily. That's how much I like her. When I saw her on sets that day... I understood for the first time that I lover her. You remember we went to her flat, I gave her a rose and proposed. That was not to hire her as the costume designer. That was my real feeling. She didn't believe me. I didn't know how to make her believe. I couldn't believe myself when I realized I love her. How can I get her to believe it? That is why I hired her so that I can have her around and talk all day. I love her a lot. I am crazy about her. But when she was dying, I couldn't go with her. Do you know how much I suffered? I experienced hell. I didn't know what to do. I still couldn't go visit her. You know about the meeting with the producer. He said he will be on the streets if the shoot isn't complete. He is my savior that gave me a chance. She has her mom and dad to look after her. You visited too. But I am the only person here. I am the director. I can explain all this to her. She would listen to the whole thing and say... 'Which movie is this scene for?' I know she won't believe it. Not just now but one person comes between us all the time. Do you know who he is? It's the director in me. That is why I am letting him go. I don't have love or cinema in my life now. But I will still live. I have no emotions like you, right? Passion isn't wrong. Passion is like penance. Be passionate. [melancholic music playing] You thought he used your love for the cinema. But he wanted to show his love through cinema. What did he gain at last? He doesn't have his dad who supports his passion. He doesn't even have the cinema he made so passionately. He is also not able to meet you, who he loves dearly. That is why he left. He will not come back. [melancholic music playing] [guitar playing] "The pain you gave me has left my soul numb" "It has created tremors in the avenues of my heart" "I envisioned a story as a director" "You turned my life into an illusion that kills" "Your success loses the war with love" "Your movie is dedicated to yourself" "Is this how the story is going to be?" "Does it have a climax in the land of dreams?" "Is a twist going to turn the tables around?" I made a mistake, sir. You and I are the reason he left. You didn't understand his passion. And I didn't understand his love. After understanding him completely... You want your director back. And I want my Mahesh. But I don't know what to do. You tell me what to do, sir You know him better than us. You think about it. What will make him come back? Sir, will you do me a small favor? He will return wherever he is. [melancholic music playing] One tea... [on TV] 'Director is creating a sensation yet again.' 'Generally, scenes are modified and added to flop films.' 'But for the already super hit film 'Darsakudu', climax has been re-shot.' 'You can see the new climax on screens from today.' 'To know how the audience will receive this new climax...' 'Wait for another day.' Will you take me to Vizag, bro? I'm in pain for dad, who always supported my passion, isn't with me. Hopelessness that I can't be with the girl I love. Namrata. All I am left with is my cinema. My final defeat. I will see how this defeat is. [melancholic music playing] [Namrata] 'Mahesh...' 'Sorry. Mr. Director...' 'How are you?' 'Actually, we didn't change your movie climax.' 'I had to do this to give a climax for our love story.’ ‘What do I do? I found no other way to make you return.’ ‘If you hadn't come, I would've been so happy that you like me more than cinema.' ‘But you did come and proved that you like cinema more than me. ‘ 'Psst! I knew this before.' ‘But what I just got to know was you like me after cinema.’ ‘Tell me why you left such cinema for me.’ 'Don't tell me that you love me more. I won't believe you.' 'That's not like you. That's not your character.' 'That is why I am telling you.' 'I like you. You are my life.' 'You need not love me.' 'You just love your cinema.' 'Don't leave your cinemas for me.' 'I know you can't.' 'Because... I can't let you go.' 'What are you looking at? That I said you need not love me...?' 'You love cinema.' 'Does cinema love you back?' 'This is also the same.' 'Your love is yours and my love is mine.' 'Love means turning both of our love into one.' 'I'll do that.' [romantic music playing] Whenever we are sad or happy, we want to share it with our childhood friends. I know... This theatre is your childhood friend. Your only friend left. Also that you will come here to witness your shattered dream. That is why I was waiting here for you. Director isn't someone who stops with one film. He is someone who travels from one film to another. Your dad's dream and your passion shouldn't stop with this film. Come back. I'll be there for you, sweetheart. You'll be there for your movies. Let's live happily. Hmm? [intense music playing] Damn! -What happened? Climax is superb. One second. Climax is great. I have to record it immediately. Hero meets heroine in the theatre. [theme music playing] [clapping]
