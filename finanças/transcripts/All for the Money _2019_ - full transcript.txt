Don't be afraid. Miss Washington, that's just a figure of speech. Um um, I know exactly what it is, and it's a figure of fear. Listen, Dr. Stephens, you know I love my auntie with my whole heart and she's a woman of God. A true woman of God, and she taught me at a very young age to never, ever speak with fear. And me being a woman of God myself, thank you Jesus, hallelujah, I will not be falling for the trick of the enemy. So please, don't be speakin' fear up in here. It upsets me. The trick of the what? Enemy. You're getting a little deep, aren't you? I was just trying to say that I think your aunt's heart condition requires an additional surgery. Another surgery? She just had one last year. Correct. And that procedure was perfectly fine for that time, but since then, things have gotten worse, and she needs to go under the knife, again. Okay, um. Okay, uh. Okay, well, what are we waiting for? Let's do it. Hmm, well, it's not that simple. Last year when she underwent surgery, she was backed by a government program that provided 100% insurance. Since then, there's been a situation with the government funding and they're providing zilch. Okay, I don't understand. Is that a new insurance program or something, I mean, what? Oh, how can I... Well yeah, if it's the kind where they don't cover nothin'. What? They ain't givin' you jack, okay? Jack, zero, zilch, nada. What other words can I think. Okay, I get it. How could that even be though? I mean, what? You know what, I don't even care. Just tell me how much it is. I gotta go in my own pocket for my favorite aunt, I'll do that. $250,000. 250,000 what? Dollars. You know, those little green pieces of paper that you use to buy stuff. How in the world are we supposed to come up with that? We? I'm a doctor, so I can blow off 250 thou in a few days and cause no problems. I suggest you do the best you can with whatever you've got, to get whatever you can get. What?

You know that doctors don't have the final say, right? God does. And he's already said that you're healed, so. But they are trying to say that, your heart is getting much, much worse and that you need this really, really expensive surgery to take care of it. It costs $250,000.

You do know how to pray, right? Yeah, yeah, I know how to pray. I grew up in the church. May we bow our heads. Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. But what good is the world, man who gains the world and loses his soul. For this day, You give us our daily bread. But we walk by faith and not by sight.

Afford me, I'm sorry, I, okay. Well, you know what, lemme put your mind at ease. There is not no amount of money in the world that could afford me. It couldn't buy my love. You know why? Why? Why don't you come over her, come over here. I'll tell you. Uh, you've heard of Jesus, right? Ohh, okay. Well, um, I actually believe that my love is built on the love He shared for all of us.

Well, he's a good story teller. Is he fine, though? Girl, look, you know with me, it ain't never been about the looks, you know. Pause! Who you think you foolin'?

Shoot, I don't deserve to be broken up with. And I'm the breaker-upper. I don't get broken up with. You're right about that. So forget him, okay, he didn't know what he had.

I'm sorry, I just wish he was bald. Shoot, he'll be that much uglier. Hater. Ugly as sin. You're such a hater. I wish he was! Hater! He'd be so much uglier.

You mean this bum is gonna get married before me? Wow! Ahhhh... I'm in pretty bad shape. I can't get a woman to save my life. And I own a dating company! Oh, god, I should have known. My mother, when I was in the 12th grade, she had to pay my, my auntie's daughter to go to the prom with me. Well, that's bad. Yeah. Shut up! Man, now, didn't anyone ask you anything! James, I was just saying.. That's Sir to you, dead man. Okay, Sir, um, all I was saying was, what are we gonna do about the money? Money, money, what money? You know, the money for the, the girl, he's got the girl, the $500,000? Oh, oh man... What? Well, there ain't no $500,000. What, what? Ah man, I've barely got $500,000 pennies. But don't you think if I had $500,000 that, well, you would be making a whole lot more money now, wouldn't you. You know, the whole point of this program was, that he... Didn't get the money. But no, you had to go out and find someone who was, actually, charming. I know. So, what are we gonna do? Well, I don't know what you're gonna do but I'm getting ready to pack up and ship out. As soon as they find out what kind of scam we were trying to pull here? They're gonna be after the both of us. Or rather, they're gonna be after the both of you because I'm gonna get gone. And I suggest that you get gone, too, boy. Oh, oh, look, brace the, while I have the chance to tell you this, I just wanna tell ya, man, get your dirty no-good, job-having behind out of here before I kick you out! 'Cause then you're gonna have a dirty, no-good, job-having behind with a foot in it! Where's the boy? Is the boy here yet? No baby, if we was here, you'd see him, don't ya think? Well, now, now, that all depends. Depends on what, Malcolm? If my eyes are open or not. And why in the world would your eyes not be open, Malcolm? Why? Yeah. Okay, now you got amnesia or something, now. You musta forgot, okay, let me refresh your memory. Okay, thank you. Okay, the last time my daughter brought a man to this house, that man was so horrible looking, I almost went blind lookin at him. Daddy, that is not true. You wanna bet, ask your mama, she the one took me to the doctor. Really, baby? It's true. I wouldn't have believed the rest of it had I not been there. I don't wanna hear it. The doctor didn't even know what to prescribe. All he told me was, next time you bring home a fella, make sure I put the shades on just in case. That must be him, ummm... I'll get the door. Baby, why you got these paper plates out here? Don't start no mess.. Paper plates! And don't be embarrassing her. And we got glass.., This might be one, don't you be embarrassing her. Well, he ain't gonna be the one.. You don't say nothing to embarrass her. What I'm gonna say? If whatever you, just don't say.. I ain't gonna say nothing, you just don't, you get these paper plates out of here. We can't eat on this! We, just don't worry about this. How we got glasses and paper plates, paper napkins and a butter knife? Mom, Dad, here's Eddie. The name's Eddie Wilson. I'm from the Nigerian tribe by way of Maywood, Illinois. Mom! Malcolm, Malcolm. Babe, could I put my glasses on now? Absolutely, please, hurry up quick. Daddy, Daddy, stop! Come here, sucker! Daddy, stop, please! Come here! Eddie, run, run. Come here, I can crawl, too, sucker. God, please stop! Hey girl, look, first off, I wanna apologize for leaving your house yesterday so abruptly, especially without any explanation. That was not cool and I'm sorry for that. It's just that I didn't know how to tell you what I'm about to tell you now. But, uh, I don't know, I've been thinking it over, I feel like the best way to even break this news to you is just to come out and say it, so here we go. Girl, this Eddie Wilson guy is not who you think he is. Okay, he is just gimmick and a hoax get someone to marry him in a week. And if he does, he will win a half-million dollars, yes. And I'm surprised you didn't have a clue. It's been all over the internet. But I guess that with your work and everything, you missed it, girl, but whatever you do, look, don't fall for this clown, okay? It's a setup. And I'm sorry you had to find out like this, but... That man does not love you and he's a manipulator and conniving. So whatever you do, just don't say Yes. Because you will definitely regret it, okay? Alright girl, well, I love you, sis, and, don't worry, you'll find someone one day. And call me back, okay, bye. No hi, hey, Eddie. No, Hey, Bobo! No. No? Oh, okay, now, now, I know you're a little upset about what happened the other night. I did not wanna give your dad a black eye. But come on, now, you saw the man chasing me around the table like I'm a chicken and he (Mumbles). Come on now, I'm gonna tell you like I told him, I'm from Maywood, alright, from the Hood. And we don't play that, anybody can get it. When were you gonna tell me? I figured you'd get the hint when you opened that glove box and you saw that gun in there, now. You still don't think I know, do you. Well, come on now, I just told you. Eddie, I'm talking about the $500,000. Oh, $500,000, now, that don't ring no bells, I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, it doesn't ring a bell. I actually have a bell. Maybe it'll help! Why do you keep a bell? Marry me in one week? $500,000 prize, is it ringing a bell now, Eddie? Huh, is it ringing? Yes, it's definitely ringing now, baby. Yeah, I thought it would. Yeah, it's ringing now. Oh, well, come on now, this... Let me explain what happened. You know what? I don't even want to hear it. I'm convinced it's a lot, lot worse than I could ever imagine. No! Yes. No. Yes! No. No! Yes. Uh-hah, see. You played a trick on me. Um-hmm, well, I guess that makes two of us. Come on now. I was gonna tell ya. I just couldn't figure out the right time. When, when? In the hotel room during the honeymoon? Ummm, that would have been nice. You know what, you know what, leave, leave! Get it and go. Come on now, baby, hear me out. Come on, sit on down, sweet thang. Now listen, now, I'm gonna be honest with you, okay? Well, yes, I was in it for the money at first. Yeah, I planned on marrying you and that was the only reason as first, but do I feel that way now? Yes. No, absolutely not. Oh, come on, now, what I wouldn't do for that half-a-million dollars to be in my back account right now. Trust me, baby. I've done more for less. If you ever wanted to marry me, I'd snatch your hand before you could even pull it back. But you know, on the way over here, you know, I've been thinking. I would understand if you're.... A person like me, baby, don't, don't deserve somebody like you. Come on, look at me. Come on, I'm old. I'm poor, I'm homeless. Look at you. You're young, pretty... You're smart. I mean, you got God in your life. Come on, what more can a man ask for in a woman, hmmm? I just don't understand, you know, you're down to earth, If you got, you got God in ya, you know. Once that really dug in, in here? On the way over here, I dug down deep, had a conversation with myself, you know. And I realized, you know, I couldn't do it. I dug down deep, I had to say no. That's right, I told him no, telling you no, I even said no to the money. Wait a minute, you said no to the money? That's right, yup. I even went down there to tell them Last Try folks exactly how I feel. Got through the whole building, didn't find nobody. Really? Not a single soul, that's right. You know what, I feel a whole lot better, now that I got that off my chest, especially the money part. Oh no, no, no! Oh my god, oh. You don't know what you just did! God, I should have know this wasn't gonna work out the way I planned. Oh, come on now. I'm so stupid. Come on. Oh, god. Don't be so down on yourself, baby. Well, me and you can work some things out. I didn't know you felt that strong about it, I'm all game, baby. Hey, what, no, get off of me! Who wants you? I'm talking about the whole ordeal. The money, the marriage, everything. I knew about it all along. Did ya? Yeah, I was just playing along with it, the whole thing. Why you do that now? All for the money. Not like that, I mean, I wasn't gonna be dishonest or anything, I just... I was trying to wait it out to see if I could actually fall in love with you quickly so we could get married and split the money 50-50. In some tripped out way, I actually thought it was a blessing from God. Oh yeah. A gift. A gift, girl, you know I'm God's gift to every woman, now. Quit playing, I'm serious. I thought this money was an answer to my prayers. My favorite aunt, she needs this really serious surgery and it just so happened to cost $250,000 that I don't have. I was gonna use my half a money, of the money to pay for it. My family is counting on me. Man, that is a problem. Course, I'd still be stuck with you after the surgery, but I didn't... No, Eddie, listen. You're a really nice guy. I was actually starting to think about the possibilities. Ummm, I knew it. Yeah, I was. Until yesterday when my parents came over. It was something about that moment when you were running around that table with my father, that I realized, that is not what I want in life. What, your daddy to have a black eye, cause I... No, a husband that's older than my parents. Ummm, I guess that is a little creepy, huh. You're terrific, you really are. Oh, I know. Yeah, I know you know. But you're just not for me. Yeah, I'm sure there's someone out there for you and I pray that there's someone out there for me, but... It's just not you and me, you know what I mean? Yeah, I get your drift. Okay, uh, why don't you go home. Yeah, go home or wherever it is you reside, just... Well right now, I'm living with my momma, since we're coming clean. Excuse me? Oh yes, I'm living with my momma in the basement. Where I better wash and dry, baby, get clean. Your clothes would never get dirty! I get it, I get it. That's good to know, though, yeah. Why don't you go back there? Go on back to your momma's house and, uh, just kind of clear your thoughts a bit and, see what direction God leads you. Find a good woman. Well, well, now, you know, I'm here. I'm here right now. God directed me right into your arms. No, no, no, no, He did not. I mean that! No, no, no. Well, maybe God's sending you the message. Ah, no, no, I don't think so. Here, grab it, grab it so you don't fall, that way. All right, all right. Dag gone, He mixed signals. Yeah, hmm, okay, that's fine, I'm down with the nicknames. Watch your step, okay. Now come on, I'm just helping you out the door. You were made for me anyway. No, it's not, it's really not. You're wrong! Bye! Wait a minute, Auntie! What the... Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie! Auntie need a man! Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie! Eddie, Eddie ♪ Money makes you do things ♪ Money makes you do things ♪ Bad things with it. Hello? Hey, baby girl. Hey, ma. Girl, guess what, I just wanna let you know I found this cutest dress, I bought it and I can't let your daddy know about it, though, but anyway, I didn't call you about all that. I called to see how my baby girl doin'. Oh, god, I just had the weirdest dream. Really? Um-hmm. You were in it and, uh, Daddy, and Auntie Sil and this old guy named, uh, Eddie Wilson. He was, ah, on this website and, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what was that last name again? Wilson. Oh wow, wow! What's so funny? I have not thought about Eddie Wilson, that name, in, man, years, oh my god. What, you know somebody named Eddie Wilson? Yeah... Your Aunt Silvia's first sweetheart was named Eddie Wilson. That boy was so fine, I mean, he wore these little, bow ties and suspenders and, oh my god, I mean, they dated through high school, they dated through grammar school, they dated through, I think they dated in the womb... Really. Ummm, it was so fine, you know what? If his daddy had not got this really good paying job and moved out of town, he could have been your uncle. I almost married my uncle! What was that, baby? Uh, nothing. But you know, one thing I really think that, the reason why your Aunt Silvia has a hard trouble to this day is because of Eddie Wilson. 'Cause once they moved out of town, I mean, she just, it just broke her heart, broke her heart. And all of a sudden she had to go to the doctor and the doctor says she had heart trouble and then he said something about her heart was skipping beats. Momma always said that the only thing that, um, would really, really help her, would be if Jesus healed her or Eddie Wilson came back from Alabama. Shoot, girl, I had a little crush on the boy myself, he was so cute, so fine. I mean, well, now that I think about it, if Eddie was back here, we wouldn't have to worry about that money 'cause they said he made a killing. He got stinking rich out there. Wow. Uh, Ma, somebody's at the door, hold on for a second. Yes, uh... I'm looking for, uh... the descendants of Silvia Washington. and they told me that, uh, that, that they live here in this address. My name is.. Eddie Wilson. That's right, Eddie Wilson. Uh... Come on in. Alright, I was hoping you'd say that. Alright, you got a lot of steps here. Maybe y'all could use a ramp. What does E.W. stand for? That was my friend's initials. Now Lord, if you was to bless me in my seasoned age with such a hunk of chocolate, ooooh, Jesus! I wouldn't know what to do. Oh, my Lord... Jesus! Is that you? My Lord!
