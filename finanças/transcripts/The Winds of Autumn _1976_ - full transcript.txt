[ducks quacking] [eagle screams in the distance] [gallop approaching] [horse neighs] Move on! [ominous music] [dramatic western music] [screaming] Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! [man] Well, boy, did you go to Canada for that water? [panting] Pa, there was a bunch of men riding on the other side of the river. They turned and headed toward Kalispell. Well, there's many strangers in our valley these days. There's nothing to concern thy self with. And pa, there was an old lady traveling with them. She looked like a witch! Hear now, young man. Thee should not judge strangers so harshly. [boy] They were evil, pa. I could just feel it. Well... Anyway, they're gone now. Hurry up. Thine mother will have a fit if we're late. [mellow instrumental music] [instrumental music intensifies] [music turns calmer] [music continues] [music fades] -[papa] Evening, Martha. -Good evening, Kermit. [Kermit] Catherine. Evening, papa. But I'm hungry. Mama, he didn't wash himself good again, he's got dirt on his arms. Back to the wash basin, young man. Oh, ma, they're clean enough. [Catherine gasps] Mama, he did it! Please calm thyself. He did what? That demon put these eggs in my chair knowing that I'd sit on them! I just forgot where I put them. He didn't forget, he did it on purpose. [Martha] Well, young master, since thou art so full of the devil, after supper, thee shall boil a dozen eggs and devil them for the picnic after services on Sunday. Oh, ma, that's girls' work. Besides... I'm supposed to go over Mr. Pepperdine's tonight. [papa] Do exactly as thy mother says. Thee can visit thy friend Pepperdine tomorrow. Yes, sir. May we say grace? [man 1] Why do we stop? [man 2] That's why. [man 2] Let's go over this. Pay attention! This is the potato field. Right alongside here is the road. Yesterday, they got about halfway through the field. I figure tomorrow they will stop somewhere along in here. [woman] Off our route... Two of the guards stay on the wagon. The other two situate themselves on either side of the field. That's what these two marks are, here. Now we'll dig two holes. Right here. Lester, that's yours. Wire, you're in this one. Now, we'll cover you two boys up about sun up. That way you'll only have to be there about... a couple hours. I ain't in shape to be put in a hole, I've got a raisin' on my butt. That's enough outta you. Don't you disrespect your uncle that way. You do what you're told! [man 2] When you get in the hole, you take a bead on the guard in front of you. When we start shootin', you cut him down. And if you miss, I'm gone leave you permanently in that whole. You understand? [chains and carts rattling] [indistinct chatter] [guard] Hold! Get off the wagon, get in line! [guards yelling indistinct orders] Line up! [suspenseful music] Lined up! Line up! [gun clicks] Alright, get them sacks out! Get 'em out! Stay in line. Come on, hurry it up! Let's go, hurry it up. In a line, get in line. Let's go! Move on. Let's go. In line! [chains rattling] [guard] Hold it up! Hold up! Bring up the wagon! Okay, bring up that wagon! [suspenseful music continues] [metallic thuds] -Guard? -Yeah? Alright. Make it snappy. [guard] Stay in sight! [prisoner] Yeah, Ferd, he wants to watch you. [prisoners laughing] Shut up! Maybe you birds would like to go all day with nothing to eat! [men laughing and groaning] [whispering] Is that you, Wire? [Lester] It's Lester, get out of here. [guard] Hey, Ferd! Didn't you hear me say to get a move on? I just had a stomach cramp for a minute. [gunshot] [action music] [indistinct voices overlapping] [shotgun clicks] Ferd! [screams excited] Whoo! Ferd! Hey, ma! Ferd! Woohoo! [laughing and crying] [dramatic music] Lester! [woman] Oh my God! [man grunting] Hang on. [Lester groans] [woman] You gonna be all right, now. [man 2] Let's get outta here! [whooshing] [boy] Mister, Pepperdine! The scythe needs sharpening, you're knocking some down. [Mr. Pepperdine] Yeah, guess I better whet it up again. [boy] Doggone... I can'â€™t figure out how I missed that rabbit last week. [kicks wheat] Well, you gotta move fast to get the right shot off. You blast away without leading it properly. Come over here. Lemme show you something. See these shells, boy? They are hard to come by these days. You don't wanna waste them. Remember that. Yes, sir. I'm sorry. [spitting] It's alright, as long as you learn something. Yes, sir. When I came by Lookout Point this morning, I saw a bunch of ducks. Looked mostly like green-head mallards. [Mr. Pepperdine] Well, a couple of them would make a nice meal. You reckon when we finish with the wheat, we could go see if they're still there? [Mr. Pepperdine] I don't see why not. I reckon it's too soon for me to try out old Betsy. I think we better stick to the 20 gauge. Yeah. Old Betsy probably kicks so hard it'd knock me head over heels. [laughs] You aren't hefty enough yet to handle a full-choke double barrel 12 gauge, but the way you filling out, it won't be long. How come you know so much about guns? Well, I used to fool around with 'em a little. [exhales sharply] Pa says thy hasn't always been a Quaker. That's right. I guess I was older than your pa before I changed my ways and joined the society of friends. Ma says thy is a good man. But she don't like them guns. Well, Joel... Gun's just a tool. A tool's got to be used to keep meat on the table. Some use guns for evil purposes and other men have to use guns to defend themselves from evil. But Joel, a gun all by itself ain't never done nothing, good or bad. It just depends upon the man using it. Yes, sir. But I'd... appreciate it if you not mention to ma or pa about me actually shooting them guns. Well, Joel, if they ask me straight out, I'm gonna have to answer truthfully. Yes, sir, I know that. I guess you won't be shooting guns anymore, ah? No, sir. I think I'm gonna keep right on shootin'. But I'm just gonna pray that ma or pa don't ask thy straight out. [Pepperdine laughs] - [adventurous music] - [excited screams] [laughing and howling] [horse neighs] [Wire] They didn't expect that! [laughs] Wooh! I think we gotta stop for Lester. [groans] Seems to me I seen a house over that ridge when we rode in. We'll stop there. [horses neigh] Mama... Mama! There are some men riding up in the yard. -[tense music] -[dog barking] [knocking on door] [knocking louder] Good morning, lady. Good morning, friend. We've got somebody with us that's hurt. We're gonna need hot water and some bandages. [Martha] Put some hot water on, Catherine. Bring him in. [exhaling sharply] [moaning] Sit down there. [gasping and moaning] [woman] Hang on, boy. You're gonna be alright, son. Where is the man around this place, ma? [woman] Where is your man? He's in the field. You ever picked any buckshot out, lady? I'll do it! If you got some tweezers. Gonna need something to help him stand the pain. Got any whiskey around? No, we don't have any whiskey. What have you got for pain? We have carbolic salve and laudanum. Well, bring the laudanum. Boys, I'll take care of Lester. Hog, you go ask the lady if she can get us some vittles. Yes, ma'am. Ma says we gonna be needing some vittles, ma'am. Catherine, get some more eggs. [gasping and moaning] It sure don't look good, does it? Give me your knife and I'll cut these away. Wish we had that whiskey. Well, you got him a bed, that's... that's more than we had before. [ominous music] [rushing wind] [music intensifies] [chickens clucking] [Ferd] Don't scream. [wind howling] Please! Let go of me! [moaning] Let go! [dramatic music] [panting and moaning] [girl crying] [grunting and moaning] [heavy breathing] [loud cry] [grunting] [music intensifies] [girl cries] [Ferd groans] [Catherine screams] [muted thud] [thud] [music ends abruptly] Hog? Where's Ferd? I don't know. He was here a minute ago. Well, get outside and find him. Go on! [heavy breathing] [Ferd sighs] [groans] [exhales sharply] God almighty, boy. You have done it this time. [inaudible] I should've let you rot in the cage, where you belong. [Martha] Catherine! Haven't seen that girl, have thee? [grunts] Catherine! [man 2] Wait a minute. Somebody's coming down the road on a mule. Damn! That must be her old man. [Kermit] Neighbors. Whoa! Damn idiot! See what you've done now? Go get Wire. Dumb! Idiot! [Martha screams] [suspenseful music] Martha! [Martha] Kermit! Kermit, oh my God! No! [Martha screaming and crying] Go on. Get it over with. [music intensifies] -[gunshot] -[Martha cries] [gunshot] [horse neighs] J. Pete, what's going on? This damn crazy son of yours has killed the girl. The worst day of my life was the day I bore you. [J. Pete] That woman came out and went to the barn looking for the girl, but then... her old man came in from the field. Them shots? You mean... Uh-huh. We didn't have no time to talk it over with you. Stark ravin' men! The whole lot of you! Don't go flying off at the handle, we had no choice! Turned my back on you half an hour, and you sealed our death warrants! Don't you realize that every lawman in the area is gonna be after us? We better get outta here before somebody sees us. The first sensible thing I've heard since... Get in there! Get Lester and get him on his horse! [galloping] [men whooping] [ominous music] Mama! [emotional music] Mama! [dramatic music] [thunder rumbling] [preacher] On behalf of the family of friends Kermit, Martha and Catherine, I welcome thee to this meeting of worship in memory of our dear friends. This day, our sympathy and our hearts reach out for young Joel. And our prayer is that God will give him the strength to look ahead and to carry on his life in the footsteps of his father. [sad music] Listen to me, young Joel. Keep your head high, son, and your faith unbroken. For it is thee to whom God will give the strength to be an inspiration to all of us. Do it in the name of your father, your mother and your sister. It was Kermit and Martha Rigney that came into our valley more than three years ago. [dog whines] They never asked for much. They gave a lot. They built this place and worked this land with their bare hands and the help of the good Lord. And Jesus said: "Behold, for I am alive forever more." [all] Amen. [thunder rumbling] [dramatic music intensifies] [music crescendo] Come here. [dog whines] [dramatic music fades] Friends, this is a sad occasion for us all. A time when we must put ourselves in the hands of the Lord. [indistinct murmuring] Evening, Joel. Evening. [preacher] We must decide who is to care for young Joel. He needs a proper guardian. I'll take care of the boy. So important a matter as the upbringing of a young boy is a matter of decision for the council of the elders. Now, if you would ask me, I-I would say that an elderly bachelor is hardly a proper person to-to educate and raise a young boy. Well... I'll abide by whatever the boy says. I reckon I'm old enough to take care of myself. But what I wanna know is who's gonna go after the men who did this. Friend Joel, you're old enough to know that we're peaceful people, opposed to meeting violence with violence. Peaceful? How can we be peaceful when this people come in and kill us? Young friend, we sympathize with thee for thy sorrow, but thee must thrust out these ugly and unchristian thoughts of vengeance. "For vengeance is mine", said the Lord. Yes, ma'am. But didn'â€™t he also say, in chapter 19 of Deuteronomy, "the elder shall send for and fetch the slayer hence, and deliver him to the avenger of blood that he may die? A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a hand for a hand, and a tooth for a tooth"? [inspiring music] Come on. Amen. [door creaks] Joel, I want you to come and stay with me until you make up your mind what you wanna do. But who will look after the place? The elders will take care of it. Don't worry. Mr. Pepperdine? You're the only man who could help me, if you would. I know what you have hidden in your trunk. And I know who you used to be. [laughs faintly] Oh, boy, that was a long time ago. I was a young man, then. Now I'm almost 70. Look at these hands. They're full of rheumatism. I couldn't do you no good, even if I tried. I'm too young and you're too old. Nobody else is willing to try. You reckon the good Lord will help me out? Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways. I just can't believe he let this evil deed go unpunished. [dog whining] Believe me, boy, the wrath of the Lord is on its way. -[cow mooing] -[chicken cackling] Mr. Pepperdine! Good morning! Good morning. [Pepperdine] You alright this morning? [Joel] Yes, sir. [cow moos] You reckon thee could do without me a while this morning? What's on your mind? I just wanted to go home to see if everything is alright. Oh, I'm sure it is. Friend Caleb said he'd take care after things. Well, I just wanted to see old Jack. He must be kind of upset about no one being there. Well... I reckon that'd be alright. You sure that won't make you feel bad? I'm sure. What time will you be back? I reckon about nine. By then I'll be over in the east field. Say, would you like to ride old Molly? No, sir. If it's all the same to you, I'd just as soon walk. [sad harmonica music] [longing music] [suspenseful music] [creaking] [music intensifies] [chickens cackling] [adventurous music] [cat meows] Doggone, Jack, it's good to see you. [donkey hee-haws] Where's old Mood? There you are, Mood. How have you been? Missed me? [dog whines] Old dog, I really missed you. And old Jack too. [Preacher] Listen to me, young Joel. Keep your head high, son, and your faith unbroken. For it is thee to whom God will give the strength to be an inspiration to all of us. [birds chirping] I need some more water. That's a boy. [moaning] You're gonna be better. [harmonica music approaching] [wagon rattling] You know, it is a pretty day! Dag gum! Wire, get on your fit. What is it, J. Pete? We alright. Take care of Lester. Hog. You stay where you are. Whoe, Professor! Whoe! Whoe! Looks like you folks could use a little help. And this is your lucky day 'cause your old knight of the west is here to help. Permit me to introduce myself. I'm Rattler Gravley, professor of herbal ointment. But you, my friends, can call me Rattler. Because everybody does. [high pitch laugh] Catching rattle snakes is my hobby. Why, if you had all the rattlers I've caught and just tie them together, you'd have a ribbon of snake skins around the world. I'm the world's champion rattle snake catcher. I snap the heads off just like you snap your fingers, friend. I ain't your friend. Well, I can hardly believe that. You look friendly. Tell me, with all that stuff, got any medicine that's worth a damn? Listen, my friend, in that little old wagon there, I've got Doctor Krab's snake oil liniment, herbal ointment, Mother Krab's tonic water, this-this thing can cure the hives, hiccup, heartburn, bunions, hemorrhoids. Why, I know a poor fellow over south Dakota, why, he had hemorrhoids so big, that he had to rest them on a chair when he went to bed. But after using one bottle of Doctor Krab's snake oil, he now sleeps on the floor and the hemorrhoid sleeps in the bed. [laughs loudly] You got anything for ridin'? [woman] Shut up, Wire. Have you got any bandages? Yes, ma'am, think I can scrape up a few. What's this man seem to be afflicted with? Blood poison. Blood poison! I got a special pottage that'll suck out the bad blood just like a hungry calf sucking its mother's milk. See that buffalo there? The only one in the world that's ever been hypnotized. I just ran alongside of him, chunk some hocusin' pocusin' at him, and stopped him cold in his tracks. Stood still he did! Just like a statue. Then I made him follow me. And he trotted all the way back to camp. [laughs loudly] Get them bandages and that pottage, then you can go on with your windbaggin'. Yes ma'am! Would you and your boys like a little dose of mother Krab's tonic water? It's only 15 cents. And besides, it's good for you. [exhales] Ahh. Yeah, lemme try that. It ain't bad. [gulping] [burps] [exhales sharply] No wonder they call you Hog. Bring that pottage right here to my son! Yes, ma'am! God! [woman] There, boy. [birds cawing] [J. Pete] What is it? This here, my friend, is the secret ingredient to a healing pottage that the world has seldom seen. Open it up, let's see it. Ouh! Christ, that stuff stinks! What the hell is it? Buffalo guts, guaranteed to suck out the poison. Well, get it out of here. I know it has an unpleasant odor, but... You take my advice, peddler, move while you're still able. Yes sir, but I'd just like to... -Move! -Oh, don't you know it! Get him out of here. [Lester groans] Hold up! Where's there a real doctor around here? Well, ma'am, that'd be old doctor Piedmont, over in Great Falls. About a two-day ride. [Rattler] I got the best medicine here... [mumbling] My pottage is as good as anybody's. [eagle screaming in the distance] Give me a couple more bottles of that tonic water. I'm afraid I'm running short on tonic. But I guess I can spare a couple. Here you go, big fella. It's 40 cents for the tonic water and 20 cents for the bandages. On second thought, I'll just jot it down and catch you the next time around. Here you go, young fella. No charge, just what you need. -What is it? -Worming medicine. Looks like you could use a good worming. [Rattler laughs] Alright, let's get the hell out of here! [Hog and Wire laugh] [dumb laugh] [chickens cackling] Joel? He was supposed to be back hours ago. What happened to him? Joel? [suspenseful music] My God! He's gone after them by himself. [music intensifies] Lord, I put these guns away a long time ago. When I did... it changed my life. [intense action music] [wind rushing] [horse neighs] [galloping away] -[music fades] -[wind howls] [fire crackling] [crickets chirping] [peaceful music] [inaudible] [inaudible] [Martha] Goodnight, Joel. Good night, ma. [thunder rumbling] [soft harmonica music] [Martha] Good night, Joel. [Joel] Good night, ma. [tranquil music] Come on, Jack! Giddy up! [Rattle's harmonica continues] [gunshot] [gunshot] Hold your fire, damn it! Hold your fire! You wouldn't shoot a man's dog if he barks when you come into his place, right? So a man ain't safe out on the prairie. You come in here shootin' up, what's wrong with you? Boy, these here snakes is my dogs. They let me know when someone is sneakin' up on me. Boy! You sure did make a mess out of Agatha and Roger. I'm sorry, I was scared. Well, they ain't no loss. I was gonna eat them anyway. I'll make stew instead of frying them. Come over and sit a spell like. You look like you could use a hot meal. No, thanks, I already ate. Oh, come on! Come on, boy. Come on. Come on. Come on up here and sit down. [Rattler mumbles] You don't have any more snakes around here, do you? Don't you worry, young fella, you're in the company of Dr. Rattler S. Gravely, the world's greatest rattle snake expert. You sure you wouldn't like a little snake and beans? I'm sure. They're good for you, they help you. Say, ain't you a little young to be traveling all by yourself? I'm just trying to catch up with the people I got lost from. You don't mean an old woman and old man and four boys, one of them hurt badly? I didn't know one of them was hurt. Yeah. They're taking him over to the Dr. Piedmont over in Great Falls. I could have fixed him by myself with my buffalo pottage, but they didn't seem to like it. How far is that from here? Great Falls? It's about a two-day ride, I'd say. But they-they goin' east, heading towards the Dakotas. Yes, sir, I think so. Are you riding or walking? I'm riding my pall's mule. Mule! Why, you ain't got no trouble at all. You know, son, If I was you, I'd head right over the top of that hill there, and over that big mountain and down into the valley. Indians use it. I've made many, many a trip over it myself. Until I collected so many possessions, I had to get me a wagon. I want you to remember one thing. Possessions is a burden. You remember that, you hear? [groans] I better get them snakes goin'. Here you go, young fella. Take this tonic water with you. You never know when you'll be took down with the measles. It's good for you, besides helping you. Yes, sir. Thank you for all your help. And don't you worry about Agatha and Roger, son, 'cause I'm the world's champion rattle snake catcher. I'll catch me some more. [birds chirping] And may God go with you, son. [inspiring music] [adventurous music] [horse neighs] [music turns dramatic] [music fades] [horse neighs in the distance] [panting] [indistinct chattering and laughter] [panting] [men speaking in Native American language] [men continue chattering] [dramatic music] [music turns calmer] [men speaking and laughing] [dramatic music] [wind blowing] [distant wolf howling] [ominous music] [wolf howling closer] [Joel screams] Jack! Hey, Jack! [eerie music] Jack! Jack! Jack! [panting] Jack! [dramatic music] [music crescendo] [music intensifies] [wind howling] [horse neighs] [peaceful music] Jack. [calm music] [music intensifies] [birds cawing] I wonder what's keeping them. [door opens] [J. Pete] How is he, doctor? Well he's about as well as could be expected. I took out all the buckshot I could find. But there is one piece lodged next to his spinal cord, and I didn't dare touch that. But what concerns me most is that blood poisoning set in in six or seven places. How soon will he be able to ride? -Ride? -Yeah. You don't understand, his condition is critical. He can't be moved, much less ride. It's out of the question. Let's go Ora Mae. Thank you, doctor. Yes, ma'am. [J. Pete] No way we can hang around town without word of it getting around. [Ora Mae] I know. We gotta leave Lester in the doctor's office till morning. Then we gotta get out of here no matter... Give me my coat! Ferd, I want you to get a wagon and fill it full of straw so it'll ride nice and easy. I'm gonna need some money. Do you have money for a wagon? Just about. We gotta get some more supplies, we gotta find some somewhere. I wonder if they got a bank in this town. [Ora Mae] I want you to find that out, Hog. In the morning, I and J. Pete is gonna take Lester and get a three hour start. Then I want you boys to take the bank. They only got one sheriff here, and he's a drunk. [J. Pete] That's it. Come on. Come on. Whoa! [J. Pete] How's Lester doing? [Hog] I don't know, I didn't check on him after you left. Why not? What about the bank? [Hog] Well, they got one here, but it's closed. Everybody does their banking at Fort Denton now, about 45 miles to the east. We're going in that direction if you want to wait. We're not going there, they got a U.S. marshal and he's got deputies. We'll have to get the money somewhere... Where's Ferd? I don't know. He ought to be here ahead of me with the wagon. That damn boy! You can't trust him 15 minutes. Alright, you-you go get him! The two of you. -[cheerful music] -[chatter and laughter] [indistinct chatter] Damn, boys, you sure came to the right place. [woman] Evening, boys. Welcome to Maydell's. I'll be right with you. Check your hardware behind the bar. Guns and gals don't mix. Give me that gun. [giggles] [indistinct conversations] [giggles] [Hog] Reckon where he is? There must be 20 or 30 rooms in this place. Yeah. [woman] Give them a drink. You boys from the mine? Yes, ma'am, that's why we're here. We got this little problem, ma'am. I know it. Everybody that comes in this place has a problem. Well, ma'am, this is kind of a special problem. This man, he's sort of a short, little scrawny fella, he must get back to the mine right away. Would you happen to know what room he's in? Lord, no. But if he's as scrawny as you say he is, I don't expect you'd have too long a wait. I got nothing but healthy girls here. Sit down and relax. He'll be out in no more than ten minutes. [cheerful music continues] This place is busier than an ant hill. No wonder, look at them girls! They're prettier than a litter of speckled pups. -Yeah. -I told you. Reckon how much they charge. More than you've got, that's for sure. Go ask her. Ask her? You ask her yourself! I'm gonna squeeze you up like a ball and bounce you out of here. [inaudible] Well? All the way up to five dollars. If you know what you want. Five dollars! You foolin'! This place is making a fortune. Have you seen anybody guardin' it? Yeah. And that's him, standing right over yonder. What's going on with you, anyway? I've been thinkin'. If there ain't no bank in this town and we ain't goin' to that town where there is a bank, what do you think about holdin' this place up? Well, that mean lookin' jasper standin' there is a good reason. You're gonna let a little reason like that hold you up, are you? I don't know, maybe I wouldn't. Hey, we ain't never held up no place like this. Let's do it. Let's wait for Ferd, we're gonna need him. Look yonder! Look yonder! Here comes that scoundrel now. [women laughing loudly] Yeah, he's got that hair all slicked down. Will you look at that! [inaudible] I betcha he done had a bath, too. What's the matter? [loud chatter continues] What are you two doing in here? Not spending ma's wagon money gettin' our back rubbed. No tellin' what else you been doin' up there. Listen, you two. I've been trottin' in that jail for more than a year while you two were having a good time. -I can't even... -Watch out, before I mash you. Now you pay attention. We're gonna rob this place. You gotta be kiddin' me. Ma will kill us. No, she won't. We need the money and the place is loaded with it. Now you listen. This is what we're gonna do. [inaudible] Ouch! [gasp] If you wanna play, buster, first you pay. George, this guy's a grabber. [cheering and clapping] [thud] [grunt] Hold it! Alright, this is a stick up! You're kidding! [laughs loudly] [girl gasps] What's going on? [women screaming] What's going on downstairs? Oh, just lay back honey, don't worry about it. Hey! Alright. Put it on the table, lady. [footsteps approaching] [door opens and closes] -Who's there? -What do you want? Shut up, this is a stick up. [Wire howls] Who is it? [havoc music] [gasps] [girl screaming] [Wire] Don't you know this is a stick up? [lively bluegrass music] [Wire] Hey! Ferd, will you hold your fire, damn it, boy! [Hog] What are you doin' boy? Check that damn door! [girl screams] I don't believe this! -Got any money? -Nobody would answer the door. Answer the door? Get down that hall and find some money. -[Hog] Where's Ferd? -[Wire] I don't know. [Hog] Get him. Hey, Ferd! [Ferd yells, excited] [Hog] I got one more room to check. [Wire] Come on, boy! Let's get out of here! [man] Come back here, damn it! [Wire howling] [Ferd] Ah? Come back here, you dirty... [man yells] What's wrong with you, ma! We got a whole bunch of money, we didn't even kill nobody. Have you forgot about Lester? Now we have to get out of here, they'll have a posse after us. Why didn't you wait as we planned? Damn it! We was already there, and it seemed like the natural thing to do. Get your butts out of here, get a wagon and get some hay, and bring Lester out of that doctor's place! I'll do it. They'd be recognized in town. Give me the money, Hog. Give me that money! You boys get packed up. [Ora Mae] Look at you. You look ridiculous! [adventurous music] [calm music] He was my first born. Only one of you any damn good. [Ora Mae sobbing] [clinking sound approaching] [horse neighing] Listen. I hear something. [clinking sound continues] What is it? I don't know, but it stopped. [suspenseful music] [shotgun clicks] J. Pete, I... I don't wanna travel anymore today. I don't wanna leave Lester here alone on his first night. Alright. Come on, boys. Let's set up the camp. [gun cock] [Ora Mae sobbing] Ma, I guess it's... my fault about Lester. Oh... Take off your hat. [moaning] [suspenseful music] [click] [sobs] [heavy breathing] [music intensifies] [leaves rustling] [panting] [suspenseful music intensifies] [horse neighs] [gunshot] [gunshot] [Ora Mae] Ferd! Ferd! [metallic clinking] [ominous music] [wind rushing] [horse neighs] [Wire] Unc, I don't like this. Can't see nothin'. Ain't no tellin' where that damn bushwhacker is. He can't see in this fog any better than we can. Well, whoever it is, he ain't no lawman I never knew a lawman to bushwhack. Why don't everybody just shut up? -And let's keep movin'. -Listen! [metallic clinking] That's the same sound I heard the day Ferd got it. Seems to be stayin' about the same distance away. We ain't gonna travel blind right into him and get our heads shot, let's spread out! You're right. Let's not get caught bunched up. [clinking continues] [suspenseful music] [gun clicks] -[gunshot] -[groan] [groaning] [gunshot] [dramatic music] I didn't know it was you! I didn't know it was you! [dramatic music] [moaning] [sad music] [wind blowing] [rain falling] [thunders rumbling] -[J. Pete] Put the horses there. -[Wire] Alright. [Hog groans] [moaning] [Hog] Easy. It looks bad. Here, lift it up. Take it easy. -Listen! -[metallic clinking] What is it? [J. Pete] I don't know. Turn out that lamp. [clinking gets closer] [suspenseful music] [rattle] [J. Pete] Bring him here, I wanna talk to him. Look at this damn thing. I ain't got nothing against pig stickin', not even a little one if he needs pig stickin'. So just you tell us everything you know since the day you could walk. I... ain't got nothing to tell. Why are you followin' us, boy? What you got against us? Who do you got with you? Nobody, I'm by myself. Why don't I just go ahead and stick him? No, the boy is traveling with somebody. Don't know how he got separated from them, but I figure he'll bring them to us. And I don't think they'll be long in comin'. Tie him to that post over there. [grunting] Alright, boy. Speak up. Who are you? My name is Joel, Joel Rigney. What are you doin' out on a night like this, Joel? After-after I finished plowin', I went over to see a friend of mine. On the way home I got caught in the storm. And it got worse. So I decided to stop off here in this barn. I don't believe a damn word of that. Check his mule, see what he's got. Don't pamper this whelp! I'll slit his throat! Don't you see that damn gun? I see the damn gun! I'm tellin' you I don't want the kid hurt until I get this thing figured out. I'm certain he's traveling with the folks after us. You ain't gonna make me believe it's no kid who did that. I didn't say he done it! I said he's traveling with those who done it. Somebody's gonna be comin' for this kid. When they do, we'll get down to the grizzle. Uhm? Gotta get some rest. You take the first watch and gag the kid. [muted scream] [rainfall and thunder continue] [rat squeaking] [galloping] [adventurous music] Unc! [Wire] Hog, you all wake up! There's somebody comin'. I knew he'd be comin'. He's circlin' around the barn. [inaudible] [suspenseful music crescendo] [Pepperdine] Mornin', friends. Easy! Put them guns down. Put 'em down! I ain't here to harm nobody. I just want that boy. But I warn you... if you force me to, I'll kill. Now, you two, back up over there. Turn around. Do what he says, Wire, I can't see him. Alright, big fella, roll over on your stomach. Easy! Joel, where are you, boy? [suspenseful music] -[gunshot] -[horse neighs] You alright, boy? Oh, it's good to see you. But you're hurt. It ain't nothin' a little turpentine won't fix. The Lord was on our side today. [tranquil harmonica music] [door creaks] Mr. Pepperdine! I ain't never seen anybody that could shoot like you did. Besides, you came in just at the right time. That thin one was gonna pig stick me. I couldn't see you. But I knew where you were when I saw the fire from them guns. And you know somethin' else? Mr. Pepperdine? [emotional music] [water splash] Are you sure you're alright? [water splash] [horse neighs] Besides... these shells are hard to come by. Let's go home, Joel. [tranquil music] [music intensifies]
