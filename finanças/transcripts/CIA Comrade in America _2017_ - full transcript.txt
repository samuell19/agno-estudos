It's like a cinema hall! Hey! Have you seen Mary? Mathai’s wife! No, I haven’t seen her. Her arrogance will take care of her later. Dear, please move a little bit. A little more. Enough, enough. There she is! -Is it true that Korah took a bribe? -I don’t know. It was there in today’s Deshabimani newspaper. We subscribe to the Deepika newspaper. Whatever it is, it is still stealing! Even after all this, Mathew still has not left Korah's side. It has to be appreciated. Hey, I saw a group of people carrying swords, sticks and red flags, getting ready to march towards the junction. Whatever happens, today will be quite the spectacle! So be it life giving God... Praise to you, alter of sanctification. Praise to you, the sepulcher of our Lord. May the Holy Mass that I have received be for me, unto the forgiveness of my debts and remission of my sins. I know not whether I shall come again to offer another sacrifice. Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution... -Long live the revolution... No. The crowd isn't enough. -How much is it? -It's nothing, comrade, -it's a short distance. -Okay then, red salute. Finance Minister Korah must resign! Sukhu, have our guys from Ramapuram arrived? Yeah, we have called as many as possible. Where is Ajipan and Jomon? Jomon is here somewhere, but Ajipan has not arrived yet. Where have they disappeared to at this time? -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! Sir, we have received a call from Korah’s house. They said it's time for him to go to church. Okay. -You go and inform that bearded guy. -Sir. Hey, Hari. It's such a pleasant Sunday. Why don’t you send your boys back home? How is that possible, sir? If the party has decided, then it doesn’t change. -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! Knowing how this is going to end, let me warn you. What? Comrade, not just you, but all your people will be beaten up. And you will have to see Korah going to church through this way. The way he presented the budget yesterday, Korah should have been lying in church yesterday. Korah will definitely go through this way. -And no matter what you do, it'll happen. -We'll see. We'll see. -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! -Altogether, it’s a disgraceful situation. -What is? Did you not see today’s newspaper? What? Hey, there are suspicions regarding a woman. What are you saying? Hey, there are some suspicions about Cesar's wife. I don't know a woman with that name in our group. George! That was just a rumor quoted by the court. Yeah, right. As if the court would spread rumors about someone's wife. If Cesar found out, would he remain calm? True. Mathew is here. Mathew, what did the bishop say? He just asked to call if we need any sort of help. -Call whom? -Jesus Christ. Who else? -Where is Korah? -He is taking a shower Traveling saint don't be scared Of the wind and the waves Sir, sir? - Who is it? Is it Mathew? -Yes, sir. Give me that shirt. Did the bishop show his true nature? Why would the bishop care? He got his engineering college, hospital, shopping mall. But still, sir, at this moment? How could he do this to us? Leave it! Who is he to teach Korah numbers? Bishop! -Korah, sir. -Yeah? Let’s stop it here. Troubles with the youth, people gossiping, then the media and court, I'm fed up with all of it. Why put up with all this? Then you tell me what I should do. I have written out the matter. You just need to sign it. -I’ll hand it over to the Chief Minister. -Resignation letter, is it? Give it to me, I will sign it. I will give it to the CM right away. -Hey, Mathew. -What? Do you know why I am specifically giving this to you? No. After I resign, only you will stay with me. No police, no gunman, and no car with a flag. What more is there to say? I will have to wait a long time just to get a cup of tea in this house. Sometimes I may also have to beg. If Korah dies after resigning, there'll be just one column on the obituary page of Manorama newspaper. But if Minister Korah dies, it would be an eight-column article on the front page. “Minister Korah passes away.” So, now, tell me, should the news be on the obituary page or on the front page? -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! -Finance Minister Korah should resign! -Finance Minister Korah should resign! -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! -Long live DYFY! -Long live DYFY! Please move aside. What is it, Hariyettaa? Sir, what is the problem? -Who are you? -What do you mean? I am Father Jomon. I am from the DYFY bishop’s house. I came to give Holy Communion to Korah. Will Korah come now? Korah, will he be coming soon? I can’t wait to give him the Holy Communion. -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! -Long live DYFY! -Long live DYFY! -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! Don't worry too much, thrash everyone with the flag. -Long live DYFY! -Long live DYFY! -Long live the revolution! -Long live the revolution! -Long live DYFY! -Long live DYFY! -Charge! -Sir, catch, catch it! Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution!

Dear, don’t sit here and speak against Korah. Mathew, not like that. -What-- -There is a reason to what he says. Today, our area president, Tony Parakkadan, lavished Korah with money on the stage. That guy is a dumb head. But the whole of Pala stood up and started booing. Those who booed were our own party members. Now let them come here asking for favors, I’ll take care of them then. What is it? Don’t you want lunch? Come on, guys, let’s have lunch. No, sir. We'll be on our way, we’ll visit Simon. He is back from Germany. If it’s German, then you don’t need lunch, right? It is getting too late, still haven’t seen him. Don’t expect him today. Tomorrow, early morning, he will be here along with the Deshabimani newspaper. You serve that rice. Isn’t it Mathew’s son who created the ruckus in Kurisupalli junction asking for Korah’s resignation? -Mathew’s only son. -How did the boy get like that? There was a practice to send children to their mother’s place during the summer break, Mathew left his son at his mother’s house during the vacation. What does that mean? Mathew has a brother-in-law. One Chandy. He is a hardcore communist. Mathew used to send his son to his place to spend vacations. Then? Mathew thought he would be spending time playing cricket. In fact, he was spending his vacation by sticking posters up and collecting donations for the communist party. One morning, when a Deshabhimani newspaper landed on the door step they realized the boy had become a communist. Speak of the devil and here he is! Ajipan, you have early morning beggars. By the way they are walking, it looks like as if the entire Pala constituency is under them. Jomon, be careful where you go. The route is filled with thieves and muggers. Pity! Hey, Jomon, just hang on. The way you performed this morning, we were sure by evening your party would have got a martyr. If someone dies protesting a cheap bribery case like this, that's no martyr. Our party calls that a suicide. Got it? Go, go. Continue begging. -Don’t we have fish? -Yes. -Did he mention anything to you? -To say what? No, whether he was going somewhere or... Let him go anywhere. What is troubling you? It's not that. The postman was searching for him. His passport or something has come. Really? Jesus. It looks like you have blessed him with good thoughts. He may be travelling to Cuba or China. Please stop it. He may be travelling to the Gulf. Even better! Our son, going to the Gulf for work! There you go. He is coming. -Mom, give me something to eat. -Serve him. Will the comrade eat Kerala Congress rice? When did Korah start paying you? Then what do you think? Your father, my grandfather, planted a few rubber trees, which helped you earn money by selling rubber. And so, I eat from here. Furthermore, for my expenses, I distribute newspapers every morning. You don’t have to talk too much. You too, Dad! Give me fried fish, Mom. Hey, the postman was searching for you. Your passport or something is here. Go somewhere and do something good with your life. Do you know something? Korah has never said anything rude to me. Today, even that happened. Somebody told him that it was Mathew’s son who organized the protest march against Korah. What is wrong with you? Who are you trying to defeat? To defeat those who pretend to be Gandhians, wearing tailor-made linen shirts costing 4000 rupees per meter! Dear, who do you think Korah is? When he was the minister for electricity, eight poles were erected just to give us this power connection. The moment you mentioned it, there goes the power. Hey! You! Water! Water! Ajipan, the postman was searching for you. -What, was it a court summons? -It’s just my passport. Passport? What is it for? Are you leaving the country? Stop, stop, stop. Bro, I have decided to leave the country. This land is filled with intolerance. Come on, Ajipan! All you comrades will keep saying something or the other. Believe it or not, a petrol auto driver cannot tolerate a diesel auto driver! Ya, ya. -Good bye. -Okay. Super. -Who is this? -Are you just coming now? -Comrade Stalin, are you leaving? -I’m fed up. -What happened? -I can’t deal with them. -What kind of attitude is that? -Let those three rule the party. No, no. I have something to tell you all. Ajipan, we’ll talk later. I'm not feeling right today. I am leaving. What is up with this guy? -Comrade? -Doing nothing! Dear Marx! Where has everyone disappeared to? You're all sitting here? You all teased the poor guy and made him leave? Whatever it was, there was no need to offend him. Why don’t you all call him back? Now, where are you from? There is something that I want to tell you all. I need to take leave from the party for a few days. -Why? -It’s time for a journey. -Is it for a revolution? -Yes. But if you leave, what would be the situation here? Ajipan, if someone like you is not here, it won’t be easy to cope with the Kerala Congress guys. Dear Marx, whether it is in Pala or in Palestine, revolution has to take place at the right moment. What do you intend to say? This is a journey that any communist would love to go on. But now this journey is as valuable as my life. What madness is this? Comrade, revolution has no meaning when preached, only when practiced. This revolution is for her, Sarah Mary Kurian. The right finger on my left hand. Stand still. Love towards your college campus is as strong as your first love. Hey, come here. That’s why, even after I finished college, I still roam around campus for student politics. Hey, stand aside. Hey, come here. Hey, what is your name? -Sarah. -What? Sarah. Where is your house? In the US. I am staying with my uncle here. So that’s why. Ajipan. Ajipan. -What is all this? -Ajipan. Has anyone dared harass you since you joined college? What is this new practice? How many papers did you miss last year? Four. Go study and write the supplementary exams. -Come, bro. -Go, go, dude. What, a pose? Get down, boys! Moments of staring eye to eye Something comes filling up within What is it? What is it? Daily when I see you upfront My inside brims up with What is it? What is it? The pathways I wandered with you topped With flowers The loving lines I forgot you lined With honey Moments of staring eye to eye Something comes filling up within What is it? What is it? Daily when I see you upfront My inside brims up with What is it? What is it? Your name? Guava. AZAD HOTEL Love rises In the heart on its own As a hundred Rainbows shine To recall every moment today Just one thing To carry just one thing to be mine -Principal Father! -Be chill. Praise be to Jesus Christ. Something comes filling up within What is it, what is it? Daily when I see you upfront My inside brims up with What is it? What is it? In America, did you only watch Bollywood movies? Yonder mountain ice is melting I flow as a river of rose water I search for a silent ocean For my lovely desires to lean into Moments of staring eye to eye Daily when I see you upfront My inside brims up with What is it? What is it? On the left, give it to the left. Kick the ball to the front. -Pass to Aji. -Mark him! Mark Ajipan! Here, take it. Foul, foul. You came forward all alone to score the goal. Then do you need to call the entire vicinity? You should follow FIFA rules while playing. What is this FIFA? Tell me at least one rule of FIFA. -How should I know? -What is FIFA? -Why should I know? -Jomon, you better play properly! Then you come here and be the goalkeeper. Everyone can’t be a goalkeeper. That’s why we only have one goalkeeper on a team. Do you know that? What do you think? Goalkeeping is a layman’s job? Here comes the red card to Ajipan. He has to go. Messi, walk fast. -Go, dude! -Get lost! -What’s the issue with Jomon? -He always cheats while playing. Go ahead. Score five goals. Give them a proper reply before Ajipan comes back. Ask him in Malayalam? What’s up, Jomon? Where is the other guy? -Who? -That beard. Hariyettan? Hariyettan has gone to Kozhikode for the party congress. So did Hariyettan join the congress? -Don’t give me that look, Aji. -Don’t you read newspapers? -I go through Vanitha sometimes. -Best! -This party congress means-- -I don’t want to hear anything, Ajipan. To tell the truth, I don’t understand most of the things you say. What is this communism, really? Communism means… -Do you bring lunch from home? -Yes. Suppose one of your classmates could not bring lunch one day. It could have been forgotten or the circumstances did not allow it. -What would you do then? -I would share my lunch. A communist does the same. You continue to preach communism, play football and spend your life here. Since the day I learnt to ride a bicycle, I've had a relationship with this ground. My course is about to end and I will be leaving to the US after. How is that possible? I am really bored over here, Aji. If you were not around, I would have left this place long ago. If you come to the US, you can easily get a job. We could happily live there. Why stay here? Because, till the tenth year, education is free in this country. Even after that, being good at studies, I have got lot of concessions. In the form of fees, choice of courses. That is because you are eligible for them. Why are you sacrificing your life? After acquiring all that, running away from here to secure a life in a multinational company wouldn’t be good for me. I'd prefer to teach in a school, or college here. Aji, we don’t have minimum financial stability here. A strong wind or downpour is sufficient to destabilize any country’s financial stability. Dear, I don’t intend to transform the country. Nevertheless, a few people must benefit because of me. Dear Saramma, I don’t want to escape alone. Ajipan! Come, come. -Why? No need, don’t come, Ajipan. -I’m coming. Mark him! Mark Ajipan! The nostalgia of NRI parents compels them to send their children to Kerala. To study the native culture. Just driving them insane. But you have never shared it with us so far. I don’t think any comrade in Kerala would share their love story with you. Why is that? Looking at this face who would dare talk about love? Nobody has seen your photograph with a smiling face. I have told you before this guy would always be like this. See! He is smiling. Then why don’t you keep smiling? Ajipan, in this world, the best lovers are among us, communist comrades! Those who don’t have anything to hide can create revolutions and love deeply. This guy will make me emotional. Tell us what happened after that? That’s when I realized love is just a silly cheesy thing. You can’t say that. All your romantic love letters have been published here in Malayalam. Trying to scare them with your beard and moustache won’t work. You continue. Now, what I am about to say should not be seen in Politburo records. Only then shall I continue further. You just let Rajeev know. Ajietta! Those Chilanka bus people caused trouble again. What is the matter? At the bus stand, we can only get in after the full ticket buyers. It sounds sensible! Other people are okay. Only these guys have problems. What happened today? When we boarded the bus this morning, they threatened us not to enter the bus with student concessions in the evening. And when Sachu asked how we would get back, before even the double bell rang they flung Sachu off the bus. -And the rest of you? -We were thrown out after the bus stopped! You could have given a punch back. Because, Ajiyetta, we only got the looks. When we were your age, we used to thrash the bus guys! And you are here after being whacked? You all are only good at fiddling with your phones and swearing on Facebook . Not only that, Ajiyetta, the bus conductor at the front door is always a nuisance. We have no other bus to go home, Ajiyetta. We are scared. What time does the bus leave from the stand? Five o'clock! Brother! Are you the attendant at the front door? Please get down. Let me get in. Brother, these days any kid that has any money would've bought a bike. The ones who have nothing have to take the bus. Our boss is in a pathetic situation right now. So he's asked us not to issue subsidized tickets. Then, brother, tell your boss, if it is that bad, then abandon the service. Comrade, leave it alone, go, go. What are you saying, comrade? This isn’t any Cartier or anything. This old watch was a gift from my father. Come. Let’s go outside and talk. Come! Bro, take those slippers! Comrade, your dosas are the real dosas! -Well, where is my Bolivian Diary? -There it is! You write it, son. I will settle the entire amount on Friday, okay? -What happened, Achaaya? You're late! -I overslept! -Okay, move then. -Okay, Ajipan! -Hey, come here! -What is it, sir? -Are you Aji Mathew? -Yes, sir. You have to come to the police station. Get in. Comrade! Take care of the papers! -Just inform Jomon. -Okay. People at home must be sleeping! -No need to call. -Okay, son. -What’s up, sir? -Come, get in. Aji Pan! Good, nice name! -Thank you, sir. -People with money may have a car or bus. Who the hell are you to teach them the right ways? -And that girl. What is her name? -Sarah. You better stop stalking her! Do you understand? Sir, I don’t need your permission to do any of those things. Manoj was an old KSQ member in Maharaja’s College, right? Don’t ever think that a thrashing by the then SFI students was your last. -What are you up to? -How does that work, sir? Is it possible to simply stand there when someone slaps you in the face? Sir, look there. Hello, sir! My name is Mathews. His father! One should cane their kids when they grow up! Otherwise they will die in the station, getting beaten up! Sir, my name is Mathews, not Chacko master! I'm here to bail him out. You are new to this station, that is why. When I was his age, there was an annoying SI in this station. When one thing led to another, I lifted him off his legs and threw him over the Pala bridge, into the Meenachill River. Later it was in one of the movies. What was its name? - Spadikam! -Yeah, Spadikam! You might have seen it, sir. Advocate, give the man those papers. Come! Leaving, sir! I will go and come back, sir. I found out everything. Why all these troubles? Private bus. Fights and pelting. It all started from my school days. But what I don’t understand is why your name popped up in between? The Chilanka bus owner, Baby Chayan, is my uncle. I’m staying at his house. Baby Chayan is my local guardian. So I got what I had to get. Baby Chayan has said something about you to my parents. I made it very clear, I am not leaving Aji and going anywhere. I may not be able to fulfill any of your wishes... but I will never go against any of your dreams. I don't believe anybody's personal record is needed for a relationship between a man and a woman. I have a loving dad and mom. A friend who always clings like cloth, and a bike that hasn’t betrayed me yet. Jesus! Which new party is he bringing home? My poor son, had to face such a plight! My God! The girl is a bad omen! Mother! Ever since the relationship with your family, my son has faced misfortunes. - It was your family that made... -Switch off the TV. ...allegations about my innocent son, had him arrested and sent to jail. The main farming here is rubber. Not because there are no other better farming options. Here, certain people like to do less profitable farming. That is why I’m in Kerala Congress and he became a communist. So, for that matter, in this house, no one is against anyone’s wishes. It’s an old house. So are we. And the oldest of all is him. Since you like him, you will surely like us too. Have the tea, dear. Aji, it’s getting late, After finishing the tea, take her home. Such a nice girl. She must be RC, I think. So what? You think they won't have kids if she's not RC? No! Baby Chayan! -You are screwed! -Shut up! Just get away from here! Stop. Sir, please don’t hesitate to come to the wedding because you have just been invited on the street. I have fixed this. Before you fix it, don’t you have to inform the local SI, comrade? I’ll give you engagement snacks and tea. But not now. Later. What sort of speech did that father give? Just to irritate people. Achaya, isn’t he that Mundakkal boy? Whoever it is, why are you so concerned? Someone must have died. Don’t stand watching, keep walking. Such an auspicious day of church festival, they are digging a sinner's grave. Hariyettaa! What’s up? When it is an emergency call, never pick up your phone. -Who died? -A person from the neighborhood. He died yesterday. Not a party man. But he was a comrade. The priest and parish people say his soul will neither reach heaven, -nor sit on the lap of Saint Abraham. -You come here. Jomon… What is the matter, Hariyettaa? Did Sarah tell you anything? Sarah? About what? I got news that she left for America yesterday. America? I enquired. It’s true. Brother. I will not stop half way. It is his father who died. He has nobody, comrade. However, burial needs to be done somewhere. Haven’t you heard anything? Stop standing and watching. Remove the soil. You don’t worry. Otherwise, it’s a bad time for all our party people. -Why blame the party? Blame her! -Hariyettaa, would you just keep quiet? I already told him before not to go after her. His damn love! We are not aware of the real situation, right? You come here. My dear comrade Jomon! She has not gone to Bharanghanam church to attend mass. She flew to America. Without informing him, too. Ajipan, don’t you know? Baby Chayan is a bourgeois scoundrel. He built a mansion. The very sight of it is scary. -So what? -That... He only has money. He is just an idiot. -Let’s drop this. -Let him be anything, so what? No. It’s ten o'clock. I’m leaving. Jomon, take the vehicle. Come on, let’s move. Come, let's go. -Come I say. -I’ll go later. -Let’s start right away, Jomon. -Why, you in a hurry? My-- The role of ten o'clock in a comrade’s family routine is something you will not understand, you are still single. Haven’t you attended my study class? Party and family structures. My dear comrade, please don’t bother me tonight. Go fast, Jomon. Tell me the truth, comrade, where are you going? Come on, hurry up, Jomon. It's cold out. It's Sarah. Sarah! Where are you? What happened to you? Aji, my mom called me and said she is sick. That’s why I left for the US with aunty. I couldn't contact you either. -Get to the point. - My parents arranged my wedding. On the 26th of this month. I don’t know when I will be able to contact you again. Just tell me what I should do. I don’t know, Aji. You must come and talk to my parents. Convince them. Please. - Please save me, Aji. - Sarah! Hello? Hello? Ajipan? -What is it, Ajipan, at this time? -Where is Hariyettan? I asked him to sleep outside if he gets in after ten o’clock. Must be out there somewhere. Hariyettaa! Hariyettaa! Don’t beat me up! I am not a party guy! It was you. My dress, dress. Why are you standing like that? Go get some tea. Tea? I will make you drink. Hariyettaa, do you sleep here? Are you here at this time to enquire about that? -Hariyettaa, she called. -Who? -Sarah. -And what did she say? She is in a trap there. -What trap? -I will tell you later. -Harietta, come, we need to go somewhere. -Where? To her uncle’s house. Baby Chayan’s house. Why? I need to discuss Sarah. I am not coming. Even so, he hates me. Harietta, don’t say that. I always considered you my elder brother, right? Dear Ajipan, don’t walk into my house so early in the morning, and start your emotional blackmail. If I say I am not coming, I will not. If anything happens to me, you must take my place as the local secretary. And build a statue of me in the town square. In any case, don’t allow that Saji Koratty to get into the local committee. Not just the area committee, even if the pressure comes from the district committee you should not yield. My dear Hariyettaa, don’t start your factionalism so early in the morning. It's not that. I have a feeling that something is going to happen to me. Nothing will happen. Dog, dog, dog. Can’t they sleep in the wee hours? If it is a big house, there will be dogs. Ajipan, if there is a dog, I’ll definitely run. Then don’t blame me later and say that I did not stand with you. It seems like nobody is home. Everybody seems to be in a deep sleep. Can we come back later? Ring the bell again. What is it? Are you here to chop the heads off of the bourgeois, this early? No, no. We just wanted to meet Baby Chayan. -Come in. -Go. Sit, sit. See, gun. Let's start with a drink in the morning. You need not. We came to discuss another matter. The alliance between our Sarah and this Ajipan. This early in the morning? At 6:00 a.m. Best time to discuss an alliance. So, shall we check for the right time and come then? It will not work out. No, rather than dismissing it outright, let's-- Have a drink and disperse this meeting. Other than discussing it, there is no way it will happen. As they like each other, so-- My brother-in-law, Kuriachan, will not agree at all. If she loves me, -I will definitely marry her. -Aji, would you remain quiet? No, no. Let him speak. You go. Go to America. And my brother-in-law will realize your love and get her married to you. But one thing, don’t reveal that you are a communist. Why would we talk about all this in a marriage proposal? Even if I do not, my brother-in-law will say this. Do you remember the matchstick factory on the banks of Meenachil River? -The one with a picture of a goat’s head? -Yes, yes. That is the one. That factory belonged to my brother-in-law. That is Sarah’s father. Your party people protested in front of it and shut it down. It was only after sinking into severe debt that he left this country. What is wrong with you guys? Even hearing your names will drive him crazy. Come, Hariyettaa. One more thing. Please do not throw stones at my bus over this issue. Baby Chayan. Maybe Sarah and her father will understand me better than you do. That is good. One more thing. I am also interested in going to the wedding on the 26th. Brother-in-law even promised me the plane tickets. But the embassy rejected the visa. Even with my background, a capitalist, you are unsatisfactory to them. So imagine yours. A jobless, vagabond! Didn’t I say he is a scoundrel? If there is any chance then you should marry her. -Why? -For bourgeois like them, that is the only fitting answer. Red salute, comrade, would you like to have some gruel? No, thanks, I've eaten. -How is your mother now? -There is a great change. The other day she identified me as Dad. In a way, it is good. She doesn't know about Dad’s death. Enough? Mom, we are leaving. Sister, just take care of Mother, I am going out. -Okay, son. -Mom, I will be back soon. We go to all holy destinations. Is Pattaya in Jerusalem? -Which? -Pattaya? Is it in Jerusalem? It is not in Jerusalem. It is nearby, at Poonjar. Brother, go home. When you get the visa, the church will inform you. Come here only then. Go. This early in the morning and he's already come with weird issues. Come, sit, sit. Which holy land are you looking to visit? -Not a holy land. America. -Economy or business class? -Sleeper is enough! -Economy is enough. Isn't that cheaper? Brother, I actually need a visa. It is urgent. -So, you don’t have a visa? -No. That is it. Want to go to America and don’t have a visa. Great! Anybody to sponsor you there? -Anybody? -Sponsor? America is an easy place to get a visa. I have heard. So what has to be done? Brother, I have to get there by the 26th of this month. -By the 26th? -What needs to be done? Today is the fifth. One, two, three, four-- Twenty-one days. Twenty-one days. No way. Even if you have a sponsor for a visiting visa, within this time frame you won't make it there. If you have any doubts, please enquire with any travel agency. -Let’s go. -Okay then. -Okay. -By the way, is the passport valid? -Don’t have a passport, any problem? -You don’t have a passport? No problem. Do you have a ration card at least? Is a ration card required? Ajipan, is a ration card needed? Do you need a ration card to travel to America? I just can’t understand what to do, Jomon! -Shall I tell you something? -What is it? Your cousin, brother Cyril, in America. How about calling him? No use. Without a passport, where can I go? Passport, we can get it done somehow! We can get a passport, we can. You heard what the agent said. Everything he said is correct. Might be. Anyway, brother Cyril is over there. If he can find a way out, that would be great. Call him. -Hello. -Hello, brother Cyril. It's me, Ajipan. -What is it at this hour? -Brother, I need your help. -Okay. Tell me. -I was in love with a girl here. Do you remember the Chilanka bus travels here? Its owner, Baby Chayan’s brother-in-law, is her father, Kuriakose. They are somewhere near to your place. Dallas or Texas. They took her from here. The 26th is her wedding. I can't even sit down in peace over here. Hey, I can sponsor you, but you can't get here within that time frame. What if I go there and speak to them? Talking with them would be a waste. You will only be insulted there. I am even ready to travel without a ticket. Tell me, if there is any way out? -There is one way but-- -What is it? Leave it. You shouldn't do it. If there is a way, then I will take it. You tell me. It is not like what you think. It’s not at all safe and it’s illegal. Most people who take that path don’t return alive. Without an American visa, just on the strength of an Indian passport travelling to America. Comrades, history is being repeated. We have a comrade who was born in Argentina, led the revolution in Cuba, finally killed in Bolivia by America’s CIA before becoming a martyr. Bolivia and Nicaragua have a visa on arrival for Indian citizens. That means a visa is not needed. With a passport and ticket, we can reach these two countries. -Then what? -A good question, Mr. Lenin! Then, from there to Mexico by road via Honduras and Guatemala. From Mexico a small jump over the wall to America. What rubbish are you saying? Daily, hundreds of people try to reach America this way. What for? For better food, for a better life. Some in search of their long lost loved ones. But, comrades, I am going to America and not dreaming of earning a single penny. You will be one of the best lovers in this world. History will praise your name. As someone who crossed the seven seas, the mountains, rivers and forests to reach his beloved, the generations will adore you. Red salute, comrade. Viva revolution. -Viva revolution. -Viva revolution. Viva revolution! Red salute! LOVE AND CAPITAL Of course, you have reached the age to make your own decisions. I have given permission for that too. But why are you going now? -I have things to take care of, Dad. -Okay, where to? To America! To America? Really? Our brother, Cyril, has helped. He has arranged for a visiting visa. Now, don’t tell anybody about this. Especially Mom. Then what should I tell Mom? Tell her that I’ve gone to Delhi or Gulf. Sh-- Gulf? I need some money. My bike. I struck a good deal with Naushad. -You don’t have to sell the bike. -Dad, that is not the case. When that bike is here, I’m sure that you will come back, even if you take some time. Money, I could give you what you need. Hey, come on, dear, don’t be so low. Have a drink. You are the one who spoils him by making him drink, aren’t you? What kind of gulp is that? Neither will you lead a decent life, nor would you let others! Dad has always been like this. Only because he forced... Hey! GROW MORE, MUST PALA. CONTINUE, MUST YOUR LOVE. Comrade, the bearer of this letter is one of our comrades. What is this, brother Hari? Nothing. A very important thing for the growth of our party. What is it? Are you resigning, brother Hari? I’m writing a letter for him. Why does he need a letter? Whenever our party sympathizer or our member goes somewhere, writing a letter introducing him is the local secretary’s responsibility and duty. -Where are you going? -I am going. -Where? -To America. My brother, Cyril, is a hero. He found a way out. -Really… -I always knew -it is not difficult to get a visa. -Why so? Look at our Prime Minister. How quickly does he visit countries? -I'll give you one. -Correct, isn’t it? Further, other than you two comrades, neither a third comrade nor a fourth Kerala Congress guy must not know of this. -No. -Give me a new letter pad. Now, not in Malayalam, but write a letter in English. -English is needed? -You know Spanish? -No. -Then start writing in English. -Come on, write. -English. Jomon, I do not know how. These days I have lost touch with my English. -So you say... -Say... Comrade. -Com-- -R-A-D-E. If I give you one punch... This man is one of our people. -Yes. -I'm right? I trust you will provide all necessary help. You will be helpful? I know. -How is it? -Not bad. -Will it pass? -Except this signature, everything else will pass. Comrade. All this talk about him going to America, is it true? Based on the way he is behaving, it looks true. See! -Hope Korah is fine, Mathew? -Yeah. Resigning would have been more graceful! Don’t you sit in my home and talk about Korah's resignation. Is this bag enough? It's a short trip, isn’t it, Mom! This is enough. -Why do you look so gloomy? Cheer up. -Why wouldn’t I be sad? How much time will it take to get to the airport? One hour. -Two, two hours. -Isn’t it a maximum of three hours? I am leaving, Mummy. -Do call. Okay then. -I'll call. -Dad. -Hey. Don’t say goodbye. It's not like it will be for long. For a few days I will need to read Deshabimani. Need to be updated. Go and come back soon. Till I return, the two of you must not fight. Go. Go. Have you taken your passport and ticket? And if you need anything, after reaching there, just call me. I definitely will, brother Hari. Okay, go. What is it, Jomon? Did anyone that you know die? Have you ever seen me cry, even after my dad’s burial at the cemetery, comrade? Every chance you get, you start your cheap drama dialogues. Idiot! Ajipan, show me that ticket. Tell me the truth, where are you going? Dude, why would I hide anything from you? I am travelling to America. At home, if my parents need anything, you must take care of them. -Does that need to be said? -No. But till I return, you are needed here. Yeah. Okay, Ajipan. -Brother Hari, I’m leaving. -Okay. May everything go as planned. Ajipan! -Take care. -Go. On average, 442 families and unaccompanied children are caught crossing the Mexican border every day. Almost half of them are deported by the US Border Patrol Force. The other half never come back. NICARAGUA Namaste. WITH CAUTION ASSOCIATION OF COWBOYS My dear Sarah! If only I could be with you in the blink of an eye. My dear comrades! This is just ridiculous! Hi! Who are you? Where did it go? People leave home for absolutely stupid reasons! Don't you have anything better to do? Is he calling the police? Comrade. Would one comrade betray another comrade? Hello, friend. I have a man here who wants to go to Mexico from Reynosa. Can you take him? Thank you, friend. Come soon. Hello, friend. Long time. This man wants to go to Reynosa. Kerala? Better head back. Otherwise you are dead. That's the last road for those who cannot lead another life. Sir, I chose this path because I have no other way. For everything, there is a price. -I also have a price. -Whatever the price is, I will pay, sir. Go on. Get inside the vehicle. -Good bye, friend. - Adios! -Come here. Sherly! -Hello! Get down. Come, girl. Sit, sit. Well, why are you going to the US? My name is Arul Jebbaraj Peter. Sir, where in Tamil Nadu are you from? -Elanka. -Elakkai? Elanka, Sri Lanka. Are you an LTTE member? These explosions will be heard till you cross the US border. In the southern realm of the Pandiyas In the streets where chariots race He was skipping along like a fawn Who could have hurt him... -Honduras. -Are there no checks here? What for? When both countries have poverty beyond limits, who will check whom? So, no checking and no fighting. Why can't you come with me to America? Why struggle here so much? I've tried two, three times. -Then? -But it was a failure. I have neither the time, nor the age to go now. This is how it will be. And I'm not so bad a person to leave you midway. Even if I do... your love will get you there. Please pass the ball, Uncle. Please pass. What kind of people travel through this way? Six months ago, from your place, from Kerala, a man named Jacob. I dropped him at the Mexico border. He promised to call me after reaching America. But he never did. I guess he never got there. L. DE TEJADA STREET MUNICIPAL POLICE How many people? -Two. Only two people. -Only two? Pay 2000 dollars. They are asking for 2000 US dollars. -I'm also thinking of performing my rites. -What rites? Last rites. Everyone here is like you. Anxiously waiting to reach America. None of them are certain about their return. That's why. But why do you wish to perform your last rites? I am also thinking of coming with you. I don't think another person like you will come this way. Mr. Aji Mathew. Don't you wish to perform your final rites? No. I'm a communist. You go ahead, sir. Oh, Holy Ghost above, I call upon thee as a servant of Jesus Christ, Jose George Sovano Chief Edwards, to sanctify our actions this day in preparation for the fulfillment of the will of God. Jose George Sovano Chief Edwards. A bottle of tequila, madam! Somehow, we must find a guide by tomorrow. Only he can help us find the way to our destination. Can't we go alone? Won't be possible for us. There is a connection between the guide and drug cartel. Without paying them, we cannot reach the US, nor stay here. I don't know whether we can reach America with the money we have. They demand that kind of money. -That is enough, sir. -America. Hey, Aji! Ajipan! Evil spirits might be wandering around there. Evil spirits don't exist for communists. All of them are Kerala Congress people. Even so, where do party members have a family tomb? Suppose I happen to die here, there won't be anyone here to even dig a sinner's grave, my dear Sarah. Yuck! Are you from India? -So? -Didn't you find a job there? Why come here and do that kind of business? Get lost! Don't you have any other business? Showing up in the morning to give free advice! Idiot! -What? -Nothing, sir. Reynosa! Everyone from starving people to Kerala Congress live here. For some, it's Gulf. Many people come here from Nicaragua and Bolivia to work. But for me, this is just a one-night shelter before reaching the American Dream. -We'll take it. -Done. Thank you. Let's go. Sir, are you going to sell the car? It's not just a car. That's my green parrot. With this vehicle, we can't go to America... -nor can we get back to Nicaragua. -Then what's it for? STOP Come quietly. Don't make eye contact! -Don't worry. It's going to be fine. -Papa. What is that for? Do you know how many girls are raped on the way? -Rape? -Yes! When people migrate one place to another due to hunger and atrocities, there are plenty of savages who kill them on their way. -Have you bought them? -What? -Condoms! -You, a Malayali? Better buy some! What if one of those savages falls in love with you? Would they rape us also? -What? -Yes! Come, we're just tired of travelling We're freezing, hungry And wishing to arrive Come walking too much And wanting to rest Sing some phrases to warm us So much travelling I forget to rest So much walking And finally towards our home So much travelling I forget to rest So much walking And finally towards our home The sky is boiling The earth is spreading This is the time When the world is without boundaries Distances shorten Flapping of wings become faster Directions change in the hurry-burry Now I yell to my country So beautiful in front of us Long live my tequila That has me drunk Bring my Morochos the drink It too and my skin Put a life at your feet And not to your soul -What happened, sir? -I don’t know -Is anything wrong? -The road ends here. We have to walk from here. Come on, guys, let's go. Let’s go. Okay, then. The sky is boiling The earth is spreading This is the time When the world is without boundaries Distances shorten Flapping of wings become faster Directions change in the hurry-burry O Lord my Lord O Lord my Lord You are my life O Lord my Lord O Lord my Lord You are my life This is my life This is how my prayers died This is my life This is how my prayers died O Lord my Lord O Lord my Lord This is our paradise There is moonlight for the petal paths In the sea There is a whirlpool of dreams The path of embers has the shine of sand The roar of rain fills the forest On the red flag of dusk O eagle comes and sits always Fly seeing this beautiful world There is no end, no burden The sky is boiling The earth is spreading This is the time When the world is without boundaries Distances shorten Flapping of wings become faster Directions change in the hurry-burry O travelling grasshopper Don’t fly away Today the earth is a gooseberry For us to play Let us come around close together The grove of the red sky Will reach my nest The golden nest I had a TV in my home back in the day. It was also Akai. No. Nothing. Lightning destroyed it. That’s all. -Why are you going? -What is your name? Pallavi. A romantic hero who crossed mountains and jungles for his love. -Laden. -Laden? My wife left me and went to the US with my daughter. And America denied me a visa. I’m eager to see my daughter... at any cost. Looking at them, we can figure out their story. -' Panjam .' - Panjam means? Poverty. You might not have seen such poverty in your country. Nothing will be available. Why are you going to America? Let all our dreams come true. Hereafter there are only drug cartels and dry deserts. And furthermore, there are deadly rattlesnakes. After all that, there is the incomplete US-Mexican border wall. Surveillance balloons with a range of ten miles that can take all our details. And the border patrol vehicles moving around day and night. Only now, I realize the helicopter that sprayed pesticides on the rubber plantation is so dangerous. Ajipan, wake up. Wake up I say. Wake up. Ajipan. No! No! -Arul, sir! -He stole everything. What happened? What happened? We lost everything. -Ran away. -That bloody guide is missing. All gone. That sinner robbed everything and ran away. They sold everything they had for this journey. Poor fellow! It was so evident from his face that he was a thief. Now, it’s not too late. We have only lost the money, we still have our lives. But without his help, we can’t go further. Shall we go back? Go back? After travelling so far? What will you do after going back? You have even sold your car. He betrayed us. We lost everything. He escaped with whatever I had. Now I’m left with nothing. What is he saying? Hurry up! Let’s run away from here! Come on! Quick! Hurry up. Don’t worry, sir. It's nothing. Papa! Now it will stop bleeding. Arul, sir... shall we leave now? You guys carry on. I’m not coming. I can’t move one step with this injured leg. -Definitely not. -What nonsense! We won’t get a car or bus from here to send you back. We will move somehow. This is nothing new to me. Reaching the US is difficult from here. Going back is quite easy. You know that I’ve done this thrice in my life. You leave. You must reach there before her marriage. Take these kids and women along with you. This place is too dangerous. I can go from here. If you wish to see me again, contact the Nicaragua party office. Ajipan. At one point in time, I always used to argue with my dad saying that he left us because he never liked us. Poor Dad! He was struggling somewhere far away for us. Then why did he not take you to America? He didn't have a visa or a green card. My dad was just an illegal immigrant. Ten to 15 years back, my dad also opted to travel this way to America. Why didn’t you try for a proper visa? -Why take such an unnecessary risk? -I tried for a visiting visa. But the white guy in the embassy said that I would not return if he let me in. He threw me out with my passport. When Dad died, we couldn't even bring his body back home. He must have been buried in some public cemetery. I need to find that. My dad’s workplace and residence. I wish to visit those places. What will you do if Sarah's parents don't agree even after getting there? At least I will get a chance to see her once again. Her parents cannot say no. Just you getting there is enough. -Are you okay, honey? -Did you hurt yourself? -Do you have water? -Yes, I do. Thanks! What happened? -We can’t go this way! -Why? What? Hours? We don’t have hours. Look at my family. No food. -We can’t walk anymore. -It’s a trap, Julio. It's over. You guys carry on. Please go, Aji. Where are we going, Papa? Do you know him? Look carefully. Goodbye. I am going through that route only. Come, sit. -How did you get here? -The same way you did. Brother! My Ajipan! -What is all this? -It's already healed. Why are you crying? Haven’t I arrived? I got scared. I only have my passport. Lost everything else. Am I not here? If my calculations are right, tomorrow is her wedding. Get inside the car first. Brother Cyril, there you are. Brother, why don’t we go there? I know her address. It's only a two-hour drive from here. Tomorrow is the wedding. If you don't want to, then just tell me. If I could travel this far, then I can find her on my own too! Find whom? What if she doesn't want you? What are you saying? Why are you saying that? The moment I found out that you had left home, I went to meet her. We were never a match for each other. For Aji, there is no other world than his home. All the people I know are here. Other than Aji, I have nobody there. And I have nothing else to do there. Then she told me one more thing. She doesn’t believe that you will come here for her, even for a day. Then why did she ask me to come? Perhaps she changed her mind once she thought over it. Or she probably never expected you to come here. In fact, after receiving your call, I contacted Uncle Mathew and told him everything. Now he knows everything. Come on, have a drink. No. One needs to be happy in order to have a drink. I can’t bear seeing you sitting like this. I was like that in 1997, when rubber prices crashed to 24 rupees. Three, four cars parked in my front yard were seized by the bankers. The girl whom I loved got married to someone else. Now she is living somewhere in California! Yet did I fail? Am I not leading a great bachelor life over here? It’s Uncle Mathew! -It’s me, Aji! -You son of a scoundrel! What the hell did you do? I haven’t slept a wink since I heard, do you know? I can’t even share anything with your mom. I made a mistake, Dad. What are you doing there right now? Are you on the beaches there, singing sad love songs? I must take the next flight out. Things are pretty dull here! Korah has resigned. As a result, I don't even go out frequently. I'm taking care of your bike. I will come, Dad. One more thing, you have to come back as my old Aji, okay? Leave all your mental and physical trauma you have suffered over there and come back! Did you hear me? One more thing, keeping with my Kerala Congress style, I’m not sure if you comrades work like that. But you should attend the wedding before you return since you made it all the way there. What do you say? I'm hanging up the phone. Okay, Dad. -Hasn't the groom arrived? -I just called them. They will be here soon. Aji, how did you get here? You are the one who asked me to come, no? For those who were never meant to be together, it is better to separate. But, Sarah, I will never forget you. There are quite a lot of young people over there, pelting stones at buses and sticking up posters, without a penny in hand. But they never betray you... nor leave you mid-way. And if they set their minds to something, nothing is impossible. Sarah, you don’t know the youth of Kerala. The experiences I've had on the journey over the last few days... I don't know how much of it you'll comprehend, even if I explain. But that journey is as valuable to me as my life now. And thank you for that. Aji, I didn’t intend to hurt you. There's only one thing that hurts me... you believed that I would never come for you. Dear friends, Korah's resignation is the right answer for all those who have been saying our ideology has acquired the taste of rust. This resignation of Korah. What do you think? Is this the speech you are going to deliver at Kurishupally junction? -Good? -Yes! -Great! -Thank you. But I won’t be coming. You're just going to annoy people. Who is that, brother Hari? Looks like a bourgeois' phone number. Answer. Hello! Local Secretary Hari Pala. -Hey, you bearded liar! -Hey, dear Ajipan! -Dude! What is the news? - You tell me! I have met Mathew. First let me learn some bad words and then I shall use it on you. If I knew, then I would have also come for support. Who is giving you the passport? Book a bench in Asad Hotel. I have many stories to tell you. -I’m hanging up. - Okay, Ajipan. -Did he cut the call? What did he say? -Book a bench at Asad Hotel. Shall I rehearse my speech once again? Do it alone. -Wait, Jomon. Listen to my speech. -No, I will not. Do you really wish to go back? Is this passport -and ticket enough to go back? -Yes, it's enough. The airline authorities might give your name to the US Government. You came to America without any visa or invitation. Your name may be blacklisted. And you can never see America, that’s all! There is nothing much to left to see in America. I will see you for Pala Jubilee. -Shall I tell you something? -Tell me. Our first love should never ever become successful. If it was, then our life would end there. Hereafter, whenever I drink at night, and if there are no snacks or soda, I’ll remember Sarah Mary Kurian in my mind and down it. You have already won, brother. And if there is any way, -don't let that Trump fellow win. -Sure. Thank you, sir. -How come you are here? -The plan flopped. -Police arrested me and the Chinese guy. -Where is Akai then? They deported him on an Air China flight. Just like his dreams about life, his political dreams also never came true. Come, we're just tired of travelling Korah won the Kerala election again, and Trump won in the US. We're freezing, hungry And wishing to arrive And Trump has vowed that a wall on the Mexico-America Border will be raised. And all the refugees will be kicked out.
