Major, I bet I can tell you why you're going to the town of Rawhide. All right, tell me. You aim to start a cattle ranch there, don't you? Correct. And you don't know much about it, do you? Correct again. Say, you're a mind-reader, my friend. How do you do it? Oh, it's just a trick of the trade. I'm a detective. -Pinkerton man? -[laughs] Mister, I'm the Pinkerton man. Pinkerton J. Pratt. Named in honor of the great detective. Say, that's quite a name to live up to. You said it, and it sure don't help to have your friends call you-- -"Pinky"? -How'd you guess it? I've got to make that name feared and respected. And Rawhide's the last chance I've got to do it. Why Rawhide? Because it's the most lawless town in the whole frontier. But after I get her tamed, the name of Pinkerton Pratt will be as famous as Wild Bill Hickok, or Wyatt Earp, or Bob Bryan. Bob Bryan? You mean you've never heard of him? The man that cleaned up Deadwood. Ran the killers out of the badlands, with a little help from yours truly, of course. Then you know him. Know him? Why, I was his partner. Many is a time we stood side by side, blazing away at the crooks and outlaws until our guns got so hot they well nigh cooked our fingers. Is that a fact? You ain't doubting me? When a man is sure of something, he has no doubts about it. Yeah. [laughs] [gunfire] Wiggle up, driver! If this is a holdup, you're wasting your time. We're not carrying anything valuable. It's him we're after. What's he done? What do you want him for? He had too many aces in his deck, and we're aiming to teach him a lesson. That's a lie. They lost their money to a better gambler and got sore. That's the truth, honest it is. Well, if he's the man you say you want, I reckon there's nothing we can do about it. You bet you can't. Come on out of there, you tinhorn. Keep your hands off those guns. You're doing a heap, interfering in other folks' business. You aren't this man's judge, and neither am I. If you have any complaints, make them with the sheriff in Rawhide. Now, get on your horse and head for home. Stranger, I'm one of the Todd brothers. Louie Todd. And the name of Todd means a lot in the town of Rawhide. I imagine it does. You heard what the judge said. Now get moving. All right, driver. Mister, that was handy and nifty as anything I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty. Not even Bob Bryan could have done it any better. You flatter me. You had a close call. I sure did. If it hadn't been for you gents, this might have been a rope. I sure thank you, and anytime I can return the favor... Without a gun, you wouldn't last long enough to do anybody a favor. Well, I had one, but I lost it getting away from those fellas. How come you beat them longhorns in a card game? You sure you wasn't cheating? I never cheat. Don't have to. As long as I've got this lucky charm, Lady Luck is always smiling on me. You wouldn't have been very lucky if those men had gotten hold of you. But I was lucky. I ran into you boys, didn't I? I wish old Lady Luck would smile at me once in a while, instead of always making ugly faces. [crowd shouting] Get your ballots out And vote for Cal Dixon Let us sing and shout He's the people's candidate Don't forget to vote And vote for Cal Dixon Will he beat Fin Elder Before it's too late? D-I-X, D-I-X-O-N Dixon is the choice Get your ballots out And vote for Cal Dixon Let us sing and shout He's the people's candidate D-I-X, D-I-X-O-N Dixon is the choice Get your ballots out And vote for Cal Dixon Let us sing and shout He's the people's candidate This is quite a reception in your honor, Pinky. It sure is, but how'd they know I was coming? Good evening. Are you for law and order, or decent government? -Are you? -Well, of course. Then I am too. -You voted yet? -No, not yet. You know, I've heard of lady governors, mayors and things, but I never realized they were so young and so pretty. Are you married? You know, a man should know a lot about his candidate. I'm not a candidate and I'm not married. My name is Jo. Josephine Fremont. And I'm supporting Cal Dixon, an honest man, for sheriff. -Come on, you vote in here. -Just a minute. First, don't you think I should know more about you? I mean, about your candidate? Well, don't you trust me? -Yes, but I-- -Well, then come on. -The polls are over there. -Let me explain. We haven't time. Please hurry. Polls close in exactly one minute! Anybody ain't voted yet? -He hasn't. -Well, then he'll sure have to be quick about it. -Here's your ballot. -Hold it, Fin. -You registered, stranger? -Why, no, I'm not. What? You're not a voter? I tried to tell you, but you wouldn't listen. Well, I sure am surprised at you, Miss Fremont. I didn't expect crooked method from a reformer. Yeah, trying to sneak in a floater. Why, I could put you in jail for that. I'd like to see you try it, Fin Elder. Now don't get excited. I'll overlook it this time. Like you overlook everything else. Polls are closed! I'm sorry I let that happen, Miss Fremont. If apologies are in order, I-- They certainly are. If I hadn't wasted my time with you, I might have rounded up a real voter. Again, I'm sorry. I take it this is a very close election. It could have been. -[man 1] Elder! -[man 2] Elder! -[man 1] Elder. -[man 2] Elder? -Elder. -Elder. -Dixon. -Dixon. Elder. -Elder. -Elder. Elder. -Elder. -Elder. -Elder. Elder. Elder. -Elder. Elder. Elder. -Elder. -Elder. And that is all. And that is plenty. Looks like you've lost, Cal. The Todd brothers are still in the saddle. [chuckles] Riding high. Well, Dixon, congratulate the winner. You didn't win the election, Fin Elder. Your friends over there stole it for you. Elder... the lawless element which you represent is running things now. But mark my words, sooner or later, the decent people of this community will take government out of your hands. Them's pretty harsh words, Judge Wayne. They're the truth, Mr. Todd. After all, we've got a right to protect our own interests. Our ranches, our cattle. Your stolen cattle. Another crack like that, and I'll load you up with lead. Don't argue with him, Cal. You'll only get the worst of it. No listen here, Dixon. I aim to keep on running a peaceful town. Oh, we know all about that, sheriff. So why don't you go ahead and celebrate your re-election. Yeah, Fin. The drinks are on you. Yeah, that's-- Oh, oh, the drinks. That's right, the drinks. Come on, boys. Everybody step up to the bar. -I'm setting them up. -[indistinct chattering] [tapping on counter] You're liable to insult the sheriff, paying for your own drink. Only a tenderfoot would do that. Name your poison, mister. Well, if it ain't Bob Bryan. Remember me? Jim Walton, from Deadwood. Sure. Glad to see you again, Jim. Why, you-- You ain't really-- Now, don't try to fool an old friend from Deadwood. You remember Pinky, my partner, don't you, Jim? Sure I do... I guess. Many's the time we stood side by side, blazing away until our guns were so hot they well nigh cooked our fingers. Didn't we, partner? [gasps and coughs] You're not going to stand there and let a man choke to death, Jim. Get him a drink... of milk. [coughs] Looks like you got yourself re-elected just in time, Fin. That's Bob Bryan at the end of the bar. You've heard of him, haven't you? Oh, yes. -Aiming to clean up Rawhide? -No. What? You giving up the law and order business? There's a better future in cattle ranching. You live longer. [laughs] -Jim, our private bottle. -Yes, sir. So you're Bob Bryan. That's right. Whom might you be? I'm Victor Todd. This here is my brother, Jules. I've already had the pleasure of meeting your brother Louie. Oh? Let's have a friendly drink before we get down to business. Business? I don't recall having any business with you. About the future of Rawhide. Me and my brothers are right interested in its welfare. I imagine you are. No, thanks. I don't drink. Aiming to settle here? Maybe. Figure on toting a marshal's badge? I hadn't thought about it. Why? It's a thankless job. And besides, this town's already got a sheriff. Fin Elder. Now, see here, Mr. Bryan, there's just one thing I want you to understand. I am the legally elected peace officer of this county. Did you say legally elected? -Now you see here, young man-- -I beg your pardon. For the moment, I forgot the respect due a public officer. Yeah, well, as long as I'm sheriff here, I don't need anybody to help me enforce the law. I've been doing my duty as I seen it, and everybody is satisfied. Well, that is, most everybody. Say no more, sheriff. You're welcome to your job. Well, now you're being sensible. Jim, you got a couple rooms for us? You bet, Bob. Here, take 4 and 5. They're the best I got. Thanks. Hey, Fin. Come here. What can I do for you, Louie? See that gent in the black suit at the poker table? Why, yeah. I want you to arrest him. Why, sure. I'll raise you 50. You're under arrest. -What for? -Why, uh... for whatever it was you done to Mr. Louie Todd, that's what for. Just a minute till I finish this hand. You'll come right now. You heard the sheriff's orders. Get up. Must take a lot of nerve to hit a man sitting down. He needed a lesson. I taught him respect for the law. Respect for your kind of law. Your mouth's open an awful lot, Dixon. And for the last time, we're warning you to keep it shut. Easy, Cal. You Todds are riding high, aren't you? Don't reach for that gun. Well, that's no gun. That's my-- [indistinct chattering] Stay where you are! Everybody! What's going on here? Sheriff, I demand that you arrest that man for murder. Why? Mr. Jules Todd? Yes, Mr. Jules Todd. Go ahead, Fin. Do your duty. All right, Fin, but mind you, I ain't admitting murder. I only shot to protect my brother. Dixon pulled a gun on him. He did not. He was reaching for his tobacco pouch. You'll find it right there by his hand. This here's the only evidence I found by his hand. You can't get away with that. Everyone knows that Dixon never carried a gun in his life. There's at least a dozen witnesses who-- Now just a minute, Fremont. All them witnesses will get a chance to testify when the case is tried in the morning. Well, what do you know? The night we hit town, there's a killing. I told you Rawhide was a place to make my reputation. Go ahead, Pinkerton. The case is all yours. [laughs] Huh? [man] Hear ye, hear ye! By virtue of the laws of this territory, a duly constituted court is now in session. The Honorable Judge Wayne presiding. You may be seated. Sheriff, have you prepared a list of the taxpayers -liable for jury duty? -Yes, Your Honor. Names are ready to be drawn. Men whose names are drawn must serve on this jury. Only legal excuses will be accepted. Pete Hanigan. Judge Robins. Rocky Rockworth. Steve Hough. Luke Anders. Dirk Dixon. Duke Thorndike. Dave Cabry. Dean Murdock. Pete Hanigan. Dick Kildaire. Rod Gilrocks. What a collection of American beauties. I'll lay you odds there ain't an honest one in the whole bunch. I'm surprised at you, Pinky, wanting to bet on a sure thing. [Wayne] Sheriff, call the first case. All right. What is your name? Jefferson King. "Faro" King, they call me. Faro's my favorite game. Your occupation? Gamb-- Um, sportsman. You are charged with obtaining money by trickery and fraud in a card game. How do you plead? Not guilty, Your Honor. Sit down till we hear the complaining witness. You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you? I do. Mr. Todd, tell us exactly how this man defrauded you. First off, he held three full houses in a row. And then he filled an inside straight flush with a one-card draw. How does that prove cheating? The only way he could do it is with a marked deck. Did you bring the deck with you? Me? Me carry a marked deck? No, sir, I wouldn't be caught with one. Then you have no evidence, no witnesses? There was two other honest men in the game, and they'd tell you the same if they happen to be here. That's all. You're excused. Mr. King. You have heard the case against you. What is your defense? I don't use marked cards. Never have. I don't need to. You see, I'm-- I'm just naturally a very lucky man. [jury laughs] [knocks gavel] Did you obtain any money from the complainant? Did you leave the game a winner? Oh, yes Your Honor. I-I always come out ahead. Then I can't dismiss the case against you, as much as I would like to do so. Sit down, please. Gentlemen of the jury, you are instructed to disregard the charge of marked cards, which was not introduced in evidence. You may now retire and decide upon your verdict. Retiring won't be necessary, judge. I reckon we're all of the same mind. Eh, boys? What is your verdict? Guilty, of course. Jefferson King, you have been found guilty. Have you anything to say before I pronounce sentence? Only that I'd like a fair trial before an honest jury. I'm sorry, but the jury cannot be discharged unless you can prove they have been bribed or threatened. According to law, I must impose the minimum sentence. Thirty days' confinement in the county jail. Well, did you ever? Why, that jury ought to be sent up for contempt of court. Next case. Mr. Todd. Jules Todd, you are charged with the murder of Cal Dixon. -How do you plead? -Not guilty, Your Honor, because he was going to kill my brother. We'll hear your story later. Sit down, please. Call the witness. Mr. Tom Fremont. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you? -I do. -Mr. Fremont, please tell the jury what led up to the shooting last night. Well, the quarrel began when Cal Dixon accused the Todd brothers of stealing cattle, and Vic Todd threatened to kill him. That's a lie! It sure is. Dixon pulled a gun on me. That's right. The sheriff found it in Dixon's hand. Because you put it there, Louie Todd. Tell him, Dad. -[indistinct chattering] -[gavel bangs] Order. Order in the court. It is for the jury, not the public, to decide on the facts. You're excused, Mr. Fremont. Thank you. Sheriff, have you the gun that was found by Mr. Dixon's hand? Yes, Your Honor. Here it is. Will you show the jury how Mr. Dixon could have carried that gun as a concealed weapon? Yes, Your Honor. Gentlemen of the jury, you're seeing for yourself it is impossible to carry a gun of that size as a concealed weapon. You are therefore instructed to disregard any testimony relating to same in reaching your verdict. We've already reached it, judge. What is your verdict? We find Jules Todd shot Cal Dixon to protect his brother. Not guilty. We demand a new jury! [all shouting angrily] -[taps gavel] -Order. Order in the court. There cannot be another trial. The law provides that no man shall be tried twice for the same offense. Mr. Todd, you are free. This court now stands adjourned. -And the bar may reopen. -[bangs gavel] [indistinct chatter] Good morning. That was a pretty raw deal, wasn't it? Just about the worst I've ever seen. Fine work, men. Oh, Mr. Bryan. How do you do? I'm Judge Wayne. I'm glad to know you, judge. This is Pinky, Pinkerton Pratt. My partner. -How do you do? -Howdy, judge. I was glad to learn that you came here. This town needs a man like you to clean out the lawless element like you did in Deadwood. And we're willing to pay your price. Say, that's a lingo we savvy, judge. You just name the price, and in 48 hours me and Bob will have everybody in town -sitting up, singing hymns. -[laughs] I'm afraid you'll have to be choirmaster all alone, Pinky. Sorry, judge, I'm not interested. Didn't you hear? They're willing to pay. I came here to settle down and do some peaceful ranching. My only interest is in locating some good grazing land. Very well, Mr. Bryan. You may think differently when you have a stake in this community. You'll find some good land open to homesteading back at the Fremont place. -Thank you, judge. -Good day, gentlemen. Hey, where are you going? Buy me a horse, take a look at that land the judge spoke about. -Should I go with you? -What for? You came to Rawhide to make your reputation, didn't you? Yeah, but I can't work without my old partner. -Can I? -[laughs] That Fremont, trying to put a noose around my neck. It's a defamation of character. It sure is, and he ought to be made to pay for it. That's not a bad idea. Today would be a good collection day with Tom Fremont likely to stay in town. Well, what are we waiting for? Five miles of trail washed out from running water. [cows lowing] [cowboy whooping] Jules, Louie and I had better go on ahead and see Andy's got everything ready at the branding pen. You better ride on back and hurry the boys up so as we can slap our brand on him before dark. That's right. [cows lowing] It's an easy job, Andy. Takes only two strokes with that special iron to change Fremont's "TF" into our "TB," proving our legal ownership. Got a little news item. Old man Fremont was snooping up on the ridge and got an eyeful. -You sure it was him? -Positive. He was riding his favorite dapple gray. That guy'll never learn. Let's toss for it. Odd man's elected. -Tails. -Heads. Heads. You fellas hurry up with your job while I'm doing mine. Chuck! Here are the things you and the boys wanted from town. Oh, thank you, Miss Jo. Here comes your dad, Miss Jo. Well, I wonder why he's in such a hurry. [gunshot] Dad! Here, let's turn him over. Help me. Hey, Ralph, give me a hand with him. Let's get him in the house. Careful with him, boys. No worry, honey. I'll be all right. You look after him, Chuck. I'm going for the doctor. That's the kind of setting I mean. Yeah, sure is, ain't it? Look! You again. That's right. Just in time to stop your runaway. Oh, that was no runaway. I was on my way into town for a doctor. My father's been seriously wounded. I'm sorry to hear that, Miss Fremont. Is there anything I can do to help? Yes, put this rig together and take it to the first ranch up the road. It looks like you had a smash-up or something. What do you think? -Where's the girl? -Gone to town. -Where's your horse? -Gone to town. -You mean, together? -That's the general idea. I don't suppose you've got anything we could hook this rig together with. Something with holding power. I sure have. Best holding power in the world. How'd you happen to have these along? Rule book says never to be without them. I've carried them with me ever since I've been a detective. Don't look like they've ever been used. They haven't, except I got myself locked up in them once. [laughs] Went around for two or three days like that, coffee and everything. Well, dear brother, did you liquidate our friend Fremont? Of course I did. Why such a stupid crack? Think I'm losing my grip? Only part of it. [Victor] Huh, I must have broke it when I fell up there. How is he, doctor? He's very low. Dad, can you hear me? Who shot you? Do you know? Do you think it was the Todds? Oh, Dad. So it was the Todds. Mr. Fremont didn't say so. He merely suspected them. What's the difference? We know they did it. Proving that's another matter. With only suspicion to go on, Miss Fremont couldn't even get a warrant, -much less a conviction. -Bob's right. She's got to have circumstantial evidence at least. Well, we're going to try to get it for her. "We"? I thought you said you was through with-- Skip it. Where was Mr. Fremont shot? Right over here? They rode in from that way. And this is where he fell. The bullet went clean through his back. Maybe we can find it. Ouch! What's the idea having an old, splintery barn? Dangerous to man or beast. That's the answer. Ah. [Bob] It's a powerful slug to do that after going through a man. Got a small stick or something? -Yeah, here you are. -What you want that for? Tell the direction and angle the bullet came from. That proves the shot was fired from up there. Yeah, but who fired the shot? That's the question. Partner, I figure we'd better take a ride-- I figure the same way, Pinky. Pinky, suppose you would have fired that shot. Where would you aim from? Right here. That's a natural ambush shot. When you snapped out your empty shell, where'd it land? About there. Look, a .30-30. Say, partner, we're doing right well in this case. Yeah, considering that only one of us is professional. Oh, you'll learn. Say, that reminds me, the rule book says never leave the scene of the crime without reenacting it. -Go ahead, Sherlock. -Huh? Oh. Well, I'd take aim on the man as he rides up to the barn. Bang! I got him. But I ain't dead sure, so I'll lever in another shell. Then I see some people come a-running. So I sneak back, further and further back, so they can't see me. Ow! Oh! Doggone it. Anything broken? Don't think so. But I'm sitting on something awful sharp. There, look. Doggone it. You know what this is? I don't care, as long as I got it out of my system. It's a broken-off revolver grip. Could be the killer fell down here, just like you did. Well, naturally. When I reenact a crime, I go whole hog. He's our man, all right. There's no two ways about that. The rule book says a murderer... [both] ...always returns to the scene of the crime. Yeah. Why'd you stop me from nailing him? Why'd you let him get away for? Because it's pretty serious business to accuse a man of murder unless you got positive proof. Give a suspect enough rope and he'll hang himself. Yeah, I see what you mean. [stammers] Just set a trap for him, like you would a rat. Right. Well, howdy, Mr. Todd. What can I do for you today? I broke my gun handle. Can you replace it right away? Sure thing. Fix it right up. How'd you break it? On a man's head, for not minding his own business. There you are, Mr. Todd. How much? Oh, about a dollar and a half. -There's two. -Well, thanks. Howdy, gents. What can I do for you? I'd like to look at some rifle ammunition. You have any of those new .30-30s? Sure thing. First batch to hit town arrived last week. Anybody try them yet? Only Mr. Vic Todd. He's the sharpest shooter in these parts. Why, he just left here. Too bad you missed him. You could have asked him how they worked. Maybe I will. You just changed the grip on his revolver, didn't you? How'd you know? This piece matches the broken one, doesn't it? If you don't mind, I'll keep this. -I know, but-- -You see, my hobby is collecting broken gun handles. [laughs] There's some of the craziest people in this world. According to my deductions, that just about cooks Mr. Vic Todd's goose, feathers and all. About time to spring that rat trap, ain't it, partner? [Bob] This is the bullet that killed Mr. Fremont. And this is the shell it came out of. Fired from Vic Todd's gun. I demand his arrest on the charge of murder. [scoffs] I can't arrest him. You haven't got any proof. All that stuff's just circumstantial evidence. Highly circumstantial. You mean you refuse to make the arrest? Why, of course. You can't come in here without even an eyewitness and expect me to cause trouble for my-- -[Faro] My friends. - My friends. [man chuckles] [door opens] Now what'll we do? Here's what you do: get out of town, fast. But why? Because there might be some trouble around here first thing, you know. You mean you want me to go? You don't want me for a partner no more? I mean I don't want you to get hurt, Pinky. There's liable to be some rough going from now on. Yeah? Just like the good old days, when we stood shoulder to shoulder. Didn't we? [chuckles] All right, partner. If that's the way you want it. Oh, Judge Wayne. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I suppose you heard about Mr. Fremont. The doctor told me. We have evidence to prove he was killed by Vic Todd, but the sheriff has refused to arrest him. Well, that doesn't surprise me. Maybe this will, judge. I've changed my mind. I'm ready to wear that badge. I'd like to be sworn in right away. That is a surprise. A most pleasant one. Please come inside. Oh, Bob. -Jules and Louie here? -No, they went to town. Took off over the hill from the branding fence. You're trespassing on private property, Mr. Bryan. And what are you doing toting that badge? -Coming after you. -Yeah? For what? You know the answer to that. Are you coming peacefully? Get on your horse. Here you are, partner. Remember next time, it ain't healthy pointing loaded guns at people. Especially when you don't know who you're pointing them at. Now just pick it up and hand it to me. Gently. So that's why you killed Tom Fremont. What are you getting at? Rustle some of his stock, didn't you? That was our own stock we was branding. You'll find a "TB" on every steer roaming our ranch. No doubt, but didn't it ever occur to you that "TB" is a mighty unhealthy brand? -[piano music playing] -Hey, Jules. Louie. All right, Mr. Todd. Pinky, you'd better take the horses to the livery stable. Right. And you'd better have these keys so you can unlock them handcuffs. There you are. After you, Mr. Todd. Come on, boy. I have a special prisoner for you, sheriff. Say, now you see here, Mr. Bryan. You ain't got any right to arrest this man. I'm the only one around these parts that has a legal right to arrest anybody. Then you don't recognize the authority of the United States government. U.S. marshal? Oh, well, that's different. Uh, what can I do for you, marshal? Lock him up. And you'd better see that he doesn't accidentally escape, unless you want to take his place in there. Excuse me. Uh, I mean, come along. Hello, Faro. Sorry to bring you such bad company. This Mr. Todd is a federal prisoner. And to save you any temptation, I'll keep the key. Unlock that door and let Vic out of there. Why, I can't do it, Louie. I haven't got the key. Marshal Bryan took it. -Did you say Marshal Bryan? -Yeah. Vic is now a prisoner of Uncle Sam, and I can't do anything about it, that is, until morning. There's something I can do about it, and right now. Step back, Vic. I'll blast this door open. Louie, you can't do that. Why, it ain't legal. And besides, it ain't going to do Vic a bit of harm to get a good night's sleep. Then just let the law take its course, if you know what I mean. I guess Fin's right, boys. But I demand a quick trial. Don't you worry a bit about that, now, Vic, because you'll get it. I'll round up a jury the first thing in the morning. -And an acquittal. -And an acquittal. [laughs] Everything's working out slick as a whistle, partner. -But one thing bothers me. -What's that? The hand-picked plug uglies that many sheriff will have sitting on the jury in that saloon. You know they're going to be friends of the Todds, just like before. This time the sheriff is going to be relieved of that duty and privilege, and the trial won't be held in the saloon. -What you mean? -Well, according to the law, judge can hold court wherever necessary. So in order to have an honest jury, we're going to visit the judge and arrange for him to hold court elsewhere. Ah. Funny, I never thought of that. Morning, judge. Is everybody here? All but the prisoner and the marshal. Miss Fremont went to see what was detaining them. I see. Where's Bob Bryan and the prisoner? Barricaded in jail and needing help. Vic Todd's brothers and friends have them trapped. Well, we'll take care of that. Come on, men. You'd better forget the road and head over the hills, or it'll be too late. [indistinct chatter] [gunfire] That marshal's going to pay for this. Fin, you and some of the boys get a big wagon from the feed store. We're crashing in. Yes, but Louie, listen-- Do you want that marshal dead, or alive to be a witness against you? Get going. [gunfire] You fellas, come with me! Hey, what are they doing coming up the alley with that wagon? They're going to try to crash in. Hey, Faro, I'm calling on you to return that favor. [Faro] It'll be a pleasure, marshal. Release him and give him a gun. [gunfire] [gunfire] Hey, pal, that bird's flown the coop. [gunshots] [gunfire] That's some shooting. You stopped your friend Louie Todd right in his tracks. That's his reward for putting me in here. Hold you fire! Hold it, hold it! Hold your fire, men. Fin Elder, you and your men come out in the open with your hands held high. I knew Rawhide was a place to make my reputation. Pinkerton Pratt gets his man. -Where's Marshal Bryan? -Huh? Oh, him? He's gone out to lasso Vic Todd. He made a getaway during the excitement.
