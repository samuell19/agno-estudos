MARSHALL, BUT YOUR COACH AND I THOUGHT THAT EARNING A FEW CREDITS IN THIS CLASS MIGHT BE BETTER THAN TAKING YOU OFF THE FOOTBALL TEAM. DON'T YOU AGREE? AND BESIDES, YOU KNOW, YOUR DRAMATIC SKILLS COULD COME IN HANDY IF YOU HAVE TO ENDORSE ATHLETIC SHOES. [ LAUGHTER ] OR BREAKFAST CEREAL. ANYWAY, AS I WAS SAYING, I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR GIVING UP PART OF YOUR CHRISTMAS VACATION TO HELP CLEAN UP THIS GRAND OLD THEATER. AS YOU KNOW, IT WAS DONATED TO THE CITY AND WE GOT A GRANT TO REOPEN IT AS THE NEW HOME OF OUR THEATER DEPARTMENT. [ APPLAUSE ] YES. NOW I KNOW A LOT OF YOU ARE ANXIOUS TO GET TO YOUR VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS... LIKE WARDROBE? WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME? WELL, BECAUSE THERE'S ABOUT 50 YEARS OF OLD COSTUMES DOWNSTAIRS AND I HAVE A FEELING THAT ONCE YOU GO DOWN THERE, WE'RE NOT GONNA BE HEARING FROM YOU AGAIN. [ GIGGLES ] BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE TO CLEAN UP THE AUDITORIUM FIRST AND THAT MEANS EVERYBODY, MARTY. AND WASTE ALL THIS TALENT ON MENIAL LABOR? COME ON. IT'LL BE FUN. WELL, LUCKILY, YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH TIME TO GET STARTED BEFORE YOU GO HOME TODAY. NOW I WANT EVERYONE OF YOU BACK HERE AT 9:00 SHARP TOMORROW MORNING. AND, ASHLEY?

OH, DON'T LET IT GET NEAR ME! CALM DOWN! MAYBE WE CAN CATCH IT. WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT? SO I CAN FEED IT TO MY SNAKE. THAT'S DISGUSTING! YOU'RE SUCH A PSYCHO. I'D RATHER BE A PSYCHO THAN A PROM QUEEN. WELL, I'D VOTE FOR YOU. [ GIGGLES ] ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT! THIS IS AN OLD BUILDING. THERE ARE GONNA BE A LOT OF RATS IN IT. I'M SURE THE MINUTE YOU START TROMPING AROUND, THEY'RE ALL GONNA DISAPPEAR. [ CLATTERING ] JESUS CHRIST! BE CAREFUL, BE CAREFUL. THERE'S GLASS. THIS PLACE ISN'T SAFE. OH, CALM DOWN. IT WAS JUST A LOOSE FIXTURE, THAT'S ALL. THAT'S RIGHT. IT WAS JUST A FREAK ACCIDENT. BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY FREAK AROUND HERE. OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND WHERE ARE YOU GOING? OUT OF HERE. YOU CAN FLUNK ME IF YOU WANT TO. [ SCREAMS ] WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? GOD, IS EVERYONE ALL RIGHT? WE'RE JUST A BIT SHAKEN UP, THAT'S ALL. I'M HARLAN CARUTHERS. I'M THE OWNER OF THIS THEATER. AT LEAST I WAS. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN, MR. CARUTHERS. PLEASE EXCUSE MY STUDENTS. WE JUST HAD A BIT OF A SCARE. YEAH. THAT ANTIQUE COULD HAVE KILLED ONE OF US. YES, OF COURSE. I'M VERY SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS. NOT MUCH OF A WELCOME, IS IT? THE OLD PLACE SEEMS TO BE FALLING APART. HASN'T YOUR FAMILY OWNED THIS THEATER FOR YEARS? OH, YES. MY UNCLE BUILT IT AROUND THE TURN OF THE CENTURY. I GREW UP LOVING IT. IT BECAME PART OF ME, PART OF MY SOUL, IN FACT. [ CHUCKLES ] CARUSO SANG HERE, YOU KNOW. McCORMICK, CHALIAPIN, MELBA. SO MANY MEMORIES, SO MANY GHOSTS. AND YOU REALLY INTEND TO REOPEN? WELL, YES, OF COURSE. [ CHUCKLES ] I THINK YOU'RE VERY BRAVE. OH, THAT TRAGEDY. THAT WAS YEARS AGO. WHAT DID YOU MEAN ABOUT BEING BRAVE? WELL, THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW ODD OCCURRENCES. YOU MEAN LIKE PARANORMAL OCCURRENCES? OH, BOY. HERE SHE GOES. I JUST WANNA KNOW IF THIS PLACE IS HAUNTED. WELL, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF AN OLD THEATER THAT ISN'T? [ GIGGLES ] OH, WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OUR GHOST. SHE'S CALLED LORRAINE, LORRAINE SEDGEWICK. HER SPIRIT STILL WALKS AMONG US. DID I SAY ANYTHING... THAT GIRL WAS HER DAUGHTER. KATE, I AM SO SORRY. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU FIRST CAME TO ME, I WASN'T SURE IF YOU COULD HANDLE THIS. I'M NOT SURE MYSELF. [ SIGHS ] WELL, I WANNA KNOW THE STORY. YEAH. I WANNA KNOW, TOO. COME ON. WHAT HAPPENED? THAT'S SO UNNECESSARY. WHATEVER, MONICA. EVERYBODY KNOWS THE STORY. SOME OPERA SINGER WENT WHACKO AND KILLED HIS LEADING LADY. ISN'T THAT RIGHT? YES, THAT'S RIGHT. HIS NAME WAS LORENZO ORSINI, THE BRILLIANT YOUNG TENOR WITH A PROMISE OF A REMARKABLE CAREER AHEAD OF HIM. SO WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO. IT HAPPENED RIGHT HERE IN THIS THEATER. THE OPERA WAS "PAGLIACCI". ORSINI WAS SINGING THE ROLE OF CARNIO AND QUITE MAGNIFICENTLY. HIS LEADING LADY WAS A RISING YOUNG OPERA STAR CALLED LORRAINE SEDGEWICK. SHE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL. HE WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT HER, BUT SHE WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. HOWEVER, ORSINI PERSISTED. HE WAS OBSESSED. HE WOULDN'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER. THEN ONE NIGHT, HE FOUND HER WITH ANOTHER MAN. IT BROKE HIM COMPLETELY. SO WHEN THE CURTAIN CAME DOWN ON THE FINAL PERFORMANCE, HE WAITED FOR LORRAINE TO BE ALONE IN HER DRESSING ROOM. STILL WEARING HIS "PAGLIACCI" COSTUME, HE BURST IN AND STABBED HER TO DEATH. THE CLEANING STAFF SAW HIM LEAVE THE THEATER COVERED IN BLOOD. MINUTES LATER, THE POLICE ARRIVED, BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. HE WAS GONE. DID THEY EVER FIND HIM? NO. SO WHERE DID HE GO? WELL, IT WAS ASSUMED HE FLED THE COUNTRY AND WENT BACK TO EUROPE. SO HE COULD STILL BE ALIVE. YEAH, PERHAPS. I DOUBT IT VERY MUCH. IT WAS SO LONG AGO. YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE FIRST THEATER I EVER WENT TO. REALLY? YEAH. WHAT WAS IT LIKE? OH, IT WAS MAGICAL. IT WAS BETTER THAN THE MOVIES. YOU KNOW, THERE WAS AN IMMEDIACY TO IT. I WAS HOOKED FROM THE FIRST SHOW. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE? IT WAS... IT WAS THE LAST PERFORMANCE OF "PAGLIACCI". YOU MEAN... MISS GIBBY? MR. CARUTHERS? HERE ARE THE REST OF THE KEYS AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU NEED, PLEASE ASK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK WE'LL BE JUST FINE HERE. OH, MISS SEDGEWICK. OH, ACTUALLY, IT'S KATE WILLIAMS. MISS WILLIAMS, I HOPE I DIDN'T UPSET YOU. TAKE CARE. THANK YOU. NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY. SOMETHING I WANT YOU TO KNOW. THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE THEATER. JUST KIDS, NICE KIDS, YOUNG, HARMLESS. NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. YOU JUST STAY OUT OF SIGHT UNTIL THEY'RE GONE, ALL RIGHT? I'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. JUST AS I'VE ALWAYS DONE. I DON'T SEE A LOT OF WORK GOING ON. OKAY, I'VE GOTTA GO BUY SOME CLEANING SUPPLIES, SO I WON'T BE BACK TONIGHT. SO, MR. HUNKY BUNS, YOU CAN LOCK UP WITH THESE. WHY ME? I KNOW YOU'D RATHER BE ON A FILM SET, BUT YOU ARE A PART OF THIS THEATER GROUP. CHERYL? I WANT EVERYONE TO STAY UNTIL SIX. NOBODY, NOBODY LEAVES EARLY, UNDERSTAND? YEAH. OKAY? SURE THING, MISS GIBBY. OH, AND TRY NOT TO DESTROY THE BUILDING, OKAY? OH, DON'T WORRY. YOU CAN TRUST US. OH, YEAH, RIGHT. CHEERS TO EVERYBODY! HERE'S TO WALNUT FOR ALLOWING US TO MAKE A BEER RUN. OH, YOU GUYS! ABSOLUTELY. HERE'S TO WALNUT. IT WAS THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET YOU ALL TO STAY. WORKS FOR ME. WHO ELSE? WHO ELSE? WHAT ABOUT OUR MASTER OF MAKEUP EFFECTS OVER THERE? HE MIGHT WIN AN OSCAR SOMEDAY. [ GIGGLES ] THANKS FOR THE BEER. THAT WAS SO GROSS. OKAY, NOW. HEY, YOU GUYS, WHERE'S KATE? I DON'T KNOW. [ GASPS ] OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT. I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU. THAT'S OKAY. I'M JUST A LITTLE JUMPY, I GUESS. I'M GEORGE. WE'RE IN HISTORY TOGETHER? OH, YOU'RE ALWAYS CUTTING CLASS. YEAH, THAT'S ME. I'M KATE. HI. [ SIGHS ] IT'S A GREAT POSTER, ISN'T IT? YOU KNOW, EVEN BEFORE I FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MY MOTHER, I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID OF CLOWNS. I MEAN, EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID. WELL, YOU KNOW WHO LON CHANEY WAS? NO. [ SIGHS ] HE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST FILM STARS THAT EVER LIVED. USED TO CALL HIM "THE MAN OF 1,000 FACES." HE'S ONE OF MY IDOLS. YEAH? WELL, HE SAID A CLOWN MAY BE AMUSING IN A CIRCUS RING, BUT WHAT WOULD BE YOUR REACTION TO OPENING A DOOR AND FINDING THAT SAME CLOWN ON YOUR FRONT STEP AT MIDNIGHT? THAT WOULD BE SCARY AS HELL. IT SURE WOULD. HEY, SUPPOSE THAT ORSINI GUY NEVER WENT BACK TO EUROPE? WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT? I HEARD THERE'S A BUNCH OF TUNNELS UNDERNEATH THIS THEATER. WHAT IF HE WENT INTO HIDING DOWN THERE? I MEAN, WHAT IF HE'S STILL HERE? ARE YOU TRYING TO SCARE ME? BECAUSE IF YOU ARE, YOU'RE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB! [ SIGHS ] HEY, I WAS STARTING TO GET WORRIED ABOUT YOU. I WANT TO SEE WHERE IT HAPPENED. NO, COME ON. NOT TONIGHT. AND WHY NOT? IT'S A PERFECT NIGHT TO VISIT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. [ BELCHES ] CAN SOMEBODY EXPLAIN WHAT WE'RE DOING DOWN HERE? OUR NEW CLASSMATE WANTS TO CHECK OUT THE MURDER SITE. OH, REAL COOL, ASHLEY. WELL, SHE DOES, DOESN'T SHE? I WANT TO SEE IT, TOO. HMM, FOILED AT THE THRESHOLD. GOOD. LET'S GO 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE ANYWAY. OH, WAIT. ISN'T THERE A KEY? YEAH. GEORGE HAS THEM, BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AMONG US. WHO NEEDS THE KEY WHEN WE HAVE GOT MUSCLES? [ CHUCKLES ] OKAY, STEP ASIDE. STEP ASIDE. [ GIGGLES ] UM, ANY MORE BRIGHT IDEAS? YEAH. HOW ABOUT WE GET INTO OUR CARS AND WE DRIVE HOME 'CAUSE IT'S ALMOST SIX. I LIKE THAT IDEA. OH, MY GOD! HOW DID SHE... THAT DOOR WAS LOCKED. MAYBE YOU'RE JUST A WEAKLING. I'M NOT A WEAKLING. SOMEBODY HIT THE LIGHTS, PLEASE? WOW. OKAY. NOW WE'VE ALL SEEN IT. LET'S GO. I WONDER IF THIS STUFF IS WORTH ANYTHING. YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T THINK MISS GIBBY WOULD APPRECIATE YOU JUST HELPING YOURSELF. BESIDES, IF ANY OF THESE THINGS BELONG TO SOMEBODY, IT'S KATE. OH, YES. ISN'T SHE RELATED TO THE VICTIM SOMEHOW? AS IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW. YOU MIGHT TRY BEING A LITTLE MORE SENSITIVE. HEY, WE'VE ALL GOT PROBLEMS. HEY, CHECK THIS OUT. YUCK! OH, GOD. I THINK I'M GONNA BE SICK. WELL, NOT IN HERE, YOU'RE NOT. COME ON, MARTY, DON'T LIE THERE. IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S STILL FRESH. JESUS! OH! HOW CAN IT STILL BE WET?

I MEAN, THIS WAS MORE THAN THAT. I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE IT WAS REAL. I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE I WAS ACTUALLY THERE AND THE KILLER WAS ALREADY IN THIS ROOM SOMEHOW AND HE WAS DRESSED LIKE A CLOWN. OKAY, BUT, SEE, YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT, SO YOU WERE JUST IMAGINING WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. NO, THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE HERE. THERE WAS SOMEONE WITH HER RIGHT BEFORE SHE DIED. MAYBE IT WAS HER LOVER. YOU KNOW, THEY SAID THAT ORSINI GUY WAS JEALOUS OF HER. YOU KNOW, I DON'T REMEMBER A THING ABOUT HER. HOW COULD YOU? YOU WEREN'T EVEN TWO YEARS OLD. BUT I JUST SAW HER CLEAR AS DAY. MOTHER?
