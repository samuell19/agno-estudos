President KIM ushered in the New Year with the message of advancement... 1995 will mark the first year of our globalization. Even though it's very early, there're barely any empty seats at this English class in Seoul. Samjin Company English Class 1995, Seoul My name is Ja-young. Ja-young LEE. My English name is Dorothy. 'TH' is pronounced with Î¸. I am... I am... I like apple. My name is Yu-nah. Yu-nah JUNG. My English name is Michelle. My hobby is reading a book. Not romance, but mystery. Understand? Especially... I love myself. Thank you. My name Bo-ram SHIM. English name Silvia. My hobby sing a song. I like... friends. Boys, be ambitious. Boys, be ambitious! One more time. Boys, be ambitious! I work Samjin Company. I think Samjin Company is best company in Korea. When I was young, my dream is career woman. And now I am career woman. So... my dream come true! Let's start... Good luck! Ready... Start! 3-2-2, 2-2-4, 1-1-1, 3-2-2, 2-2-4, 1-1-1. Done! 12 seconds, new record! Very nice. What? You're born to do this. You're even more full of shit today. Do you know the history of why women left the kitchen for work? Why do you always ask things we don't know? During the Industrial Revolution, there were so few workers that country gals worked at textile mills. But in the start of 20th Century, most women worked. Do you know why? Cheap labour. Obedient, know how to make coffee to men's exact tastes. She sure is a Gen X-er. Can we be one without going to university? Forget it, why are you all working so hard? We'll get fired when we get married and become pregnant. General Affairs' Mrs. KIM didn't get fired, she resigned. Flowers blossom, but rainstorm moves in. I worked so hard to train you! I thought you'd finally be useful! How could you get pregnant? If they pressure you like this, would you be able to stay? We're not far off. We'll only do chores for being high school grads and fade away. General Affairs' Mrs. KIM is our future. I won't get married. I'm gonna get promoted. Abolish Prejudice! Skill-based Work! Creation of English TOEIC Class For high school grad employees... Don't be naive. How could you surpass 600 in 3 months? I can do it, you can do it, we can do it! Yes! No, no, no! It's obvious, it's their first step to laying us off. Trying to get rid of cheap laborers like us. She's got talent for ruining the mood. Anyway, what's our severance if we quit now? 3 months worth of our salary, so $2,400.65, 1,000% our bonus, never used day offs, our severance is $11,063.78. So much! How is that so much? We worked 8 years. If we were college-grads, we'd get $20k or $30k. Anyway, let's resign. Get our severance and leave this country. We're free to travel abroad, so date foreign guys. I always wanted to backpack across Europe. I heard baguettes in Paris are so good. Paris is great, croissant and chocolate... I'm hungry. I've never flown before. Samjin Electronics Production Management Team 3 Production Management Team 3, LEE Ja-young speaking. Yes, I'll connect you. - Mr. HONG? - Yes? Line 3. This is Manager HONG. - Ja-young? - Yes? How do you copy and paste this text again? Over here, press ctrl C then ctrl V. I always forget... Sir, the secretary wants us to fetch Managing Director OH's items. Forget it! We're not maids for the chairman's son. Why are they handing down their work? We're not movers... Accounting Department Samjin Accounting Principles Everyone ready? All right, your ideas. 'Center of the world, Global Samjin.' Weak. 'World's Best, Global Samjin.' Too obvious. 'Enjoy World, Global Samjin.' Rationale? I imagined from the perspective of buyers, not sellers... 'Enjoy World'... Enjoy what? Too tacky. I thought about the insight from the consumer's perspective. It's not bad. It's good, actually! Excellent! CHO Min-jung, today's you have grown more than yesterday's. Thank you! Come on, say it out loud. Enjoy World, Global Samjin! Once more! Enjoy World, Global Samjin! Freaking bitch! Having fun? Holy shit! I'm sorry... It's okay, I was curious if you were having fun. It's not fun, I'm just doing it. Have you seen Amadeus? When I look at you, I'm reminded of that film. I'm like Salieri and you're like Mozart. Is that a good thing? A bummer, actually. An Olympiad-winning math prodigy is used to balance bar receipts. Bo-ram, I always wanted to tell you something. Don't think that the boundaries set by others are everything. Always do things that you enjoy. Okay? Yes, okay. Mr. CHOI, looking for something? I saw the last quarter order forms here. Ms. LEE, thank you, you're like my senior. CHOI Dong-su. You're messing up the seniority. If you're an assistant manager, then act like one, is this army? No, sir! - Going by hiring seniority? - No, sir! - LEE Ja-young. - Yes? - Do it right. - Yes, sir! Mr. AHN, sir. Mr. OH, welcome. Can I use this? There's nothing in my room. - Hey, HONG! - Sir? I told you to fetch his items from the factory! CHOI, didn't I tell you to go to the factory in the morning? Uh, that... He transferred to the HQ so long ago already! Ms. LEE, take a look at this. I guess the chairman's son, OH thought he'd be the CEO. He's like Invidia, the Greek goddess of envy. I'm kinda scared of him. He feels like a psycho. He just feels petty and childish. He's so off... China, photo frames, golf clubs... Yes, we got them all. We'll head back then. What about the goldfish? Wait, there's a goldfish, should we take it? Yes, I understand. - He told us to throw it out. - What? How? You just flush it down the toilet. It'll die. Nah, it'll swim out to the ocean. No way... That's his fate. I'm back from school! Let's go, I'm hungry. Have a good life. Samjin Electronics The early bird catches the worm. The early bird catches the worm! It means, wake up early, and you'll be productive. Even a worm will turn. Even a worm will turn! If you step on a worm, even it will react to it. Excuse me, Jerry. Yes, Amy? We were top in national trade schools, and we know the basics, so just ramp it up. Okay. Ramping up. Today mountain kill bird. Today, mountain, kill, bird. Today mountain kill bird. Come on faster, faster. Yesterday river save fish! Yesterday, river, save, fish. Yesterday, river, save, fish. You have to say it faster! Yesterday... river... save fish... Jesus! Mr. CHOI, I think we should report it. Report what? The factory wastewater, the waterfall. I didn't see it. But you saw the dead fish. Ms. LEE, couldn't we... just look the other way? Ok-ju factory is our jurisdiction. To be honest, we weren't there on an inspection. I still think we should report it. Don't do this to me. You know what Mr. HONG's like. He may be prickly, but he does it right. No, no. I can't say anything, what'd I report? I witnessed factory waste being dumped into a river, we need to investigate if it's a malfunction of the incinerator, or unauthorized discharge, check the report for details. Ok-ju Factory Waste Dumping Report That's all we need to do? Yes. What if I get scolded? Either get scolded now, or after this blows up, which is better? I'll get scolded either way. Mr. CHOI, this is your work. Got any anti-anxiety pills? Mr. HONG, I have something to report to you. What? Caused another trouble? No, sir. Sent the wrong fax? No, it's not that... Broke the fax machine? No... Then speak! What is it? Uh, it's not that... It's about our factory... Something's odd with the wastewater, it should be investigated. Details of it are... I could never understand what you're getting at. Ok-ju Factory Waste Dumping Report If you read that... You sure about this? Yes, I think I'm sure. The way I look at it... Okay, I'll take care of it. Nice report. Right, yes. - Good job. - Thank you. - Off you go. - Yes. How about someone modern and international for the model of Global Samjin? Too abstract, let's evaluate the candidates first. Someone gentle but wild, intelligent but innocent. Mild but sexy, someone like that... No one here like that, they're too Korean. What about a foreign model? How about Tom Cruise? Do you even know how much he costs? You're out of your mind. What the heck. Ms. JUNG, got any good ideas? Someone like our president? Right, like our president. He'd be perfect if he wasn't the president. Wait, what if he does it? No, never mind... I think it's fine. Bill Gates appears in Microsoft commercials. Right, let's think this through. He's a global character. We cannot survive the limitless competition in the global market without change and turnaround. Gentle... Samjin Group is a corporation. and innocent. Therefore, we have to be reborn. Mild... Committed to our customers, dedicated to our shareholders. Sexy... Erasing the old image as an outdated conglomerate run by family owner. Sweet... What if he really does it? Too absurd? Just push for it? I'm feeling it. Should I call his secretary? No way, this must be done in person! - Ms. JUNG. - Yes? Today's you have grown more than yesterday's. Thank you. What's going on? We're conducting an investigation. Investigation? - Who is he? - Village foreman. Does it have a name? Bo-ram's goldfish, so... How's Rambo? Awkward, so awkward... Can I really keep it? Sure, you'll need company. Pardon? I'm not well. Take rest of the day off. It's cancer, last stage. Bo-ram, it's been fun. Thank you for everything, sir. - Take care. - Good bye, sir. Ok-ju Real Estate - Good work. - Thank you for coming so far. - Hello. - Can I help you? I'm from Samjin Electronics. It's a chemical used to make circuit boards. Just a tiny bit leaked. It means there's no problem. We'll be okay? Yes, right there. Thank you. Hello! Good afternoon, we're from Samjin! Yes. Hello, I'm from Samjin Electronics. I came to tell you about our Ok-ju factory. There was a small Phenol leak due to wastewater spill... The village foreman told me. I apologize for causing concern on my company's behalf. - We're getting paid? - Yes. Korea Bar Incredible. It still bothers me! Do you know why the Brits lie in the park on a sunny day? Have I told you the history behind it? Well, probably. London gets smoggy often, right? That's why whenever it's sunny, they chill out. In 1952, the sky went dark when fog and coal met. The Great Smog of London, can you imagine? The air pollution was so bad that over 10,000 people died. Korea's not far off, we'll probably buy oxygen. And sell air purifiers. No way! Get this, there were murders disguised as smog victims. They killed people and said the smog killed them. It must be nice to know so much. You're the boss. If it's safe, why pay them off? The village foreman said... I looked into it myself, Phenol is categorized as a fatal poison. Even if it's safe, it's true that there was a leak. My nephew is a TV reporter. It was a fair settlement. Phenol? What's that? It's a chemical used to make circuit boards, it's really dangerous if it's not incinerated. Dorothy, ill people are plenty in this world. Good work, it's all over. That's right. Finish. Our company wouldn't lie about it. My company is right. Dorothy English well. I saw it myself, Phenol leaked like a waterfall... Dang it... Do you have the analysis report? It's in English? Was this done in the States? The village foreman said he couldn't trust any Korean labs. Certificate analysis... What does it mean? Just look at the numbers, it says 1.98 here. Under 3 means 'Safety.' You said it was a waterfall. 1.98 mg per 1L is... only about this much. What was the diameter? That pipe you saw. About 1m. Width of the stream? About 4 times that of here to there. How long did you see the waterfall? Over a minute? 20-30 seconds? Conservatively, to leak like a waterfall... it needs to have at least 30 mg per 1L. This bothers me even more. There's a number here, let's call them. Hello. This is Michelle. Wait a minute. Hi, my name is Ja-young. I mean... This is Dorothy. I am career woman. Pardon? Pardon? Hi, I'm calling from Samjin Electronics headquarters in Korea. I want to ask about a water analysis we requested. I have a question for you about a water analysis that we submitted to your lab. We'd like to double check the Phenol test results. We actually need to double check the result of the Phenol test again. It says the result is 1.98... So we got 1.9... Wait, sorry. Isn't this the California Environmental Research Institute? Pardon? What did they say? It's a corn farm in Nebraska. Corn farm? This number is to a corn farm in Nebraska. Corn? Farm? This is a copy, did you see the original? How could I see that? You think the original is different? It's a mystery. If this is fake, then someone manipulated it. Who? Why? - Who was in charge of this? - Mr. HONG. Should I go ask? Are you nuts? He's the prime suspect. Mr. HONG? No, he can't be it. Do killers write what they are on their foreheads? Rude Nosy Why did they do it? Why'd go this far? Ja-young, this is enough, call it quits here. We have to dig deeper, see what exactly is going on. Then what? Gonna be a whistleblower? Don't get involved, you'll get hurt. Yeah, they probably didn't bother with an analysis. - They did! - Holy shit! The Phenol test was conducted. So-ra, how'd you know? I was the contact point. Where? Where...? The research lab. - Which research lab? - S... S? San Francisco! Seattle! Chicago! Really? Seoul National University in Sillim. Oh, SNU? I don't know if the record is still there. See ya. Dammit! Morning exercise will begin shortly. I'll head out first, I'm late. Daily Exercise For Office Workers âª Put the tough âª âª world in the first shot, âª âª and chug it down âª âª Bury all your worries âª âª for this moment âª âª Fill your dreams in âª âª the second shots... âª Where's Ja-young? She said today is... that day. That day? I see. Yes! Yes! Seoul National University - Phenol? - Yes. It's bad, a toxic substance. It creates respiratory, digestive and skin problems, leads to cancer that disables central nerves... If it's serious, it could lead to death. Death? Yes, if it's serious, it's about the quantity. You're from Samjin Electronics? My company requested water analysis, right? That's right. Have you analyzed it? We did. Did you send the analysis report? I did, what's the problem? My department is in charge, but didn't receive the report, could you make me a copy? Let me see your business card. LEE Ja-young - Samjin Group You guys work strangely. Pardon? You guys told me to destroy it a few days ago, now you want a copy, make up your mind. Let me check this. I'm really sorry. Coffee, coffee... An Ovation to the Last Place The world is changing. And we are standing in the center of it. But we must act. Rather than adjusting to an unreasonable world, one must join forces with others to change the world. We must put into action. Yes? Could you just tell me the number? It's not 1.98, right? Is it over 10? Over 100? 200? Professor, this could lead to saving someone's life! Ok-ju Water Analysis Looking for something? Rambo is gone... The goldfish, did you move it? I'm sorry. What about the task I ordered you? I'm working on it. I thought you were fast, what's taking so long? The numbers are all wrong... You nuts? Patching up those numbers is your job! Fix it, okay? Yes, okay... There's an idea of making you the ad model of Samjin. Are you serious? We're serious, president. Oh, come on. Ms. JUNG from my department mentioned Bill Gates, it's a great suggestion. Ms. JUNG? Who is Ms. JUNG? Come in. So you are the one who got me in trouble. Why would you think of me? She cannot understand your English. Oh, really. The reason why I thought you'd be a good fit is that you would become the first CEO to be featured in an ad. It could spark interest, and you'd increase credibility. At least that's what I thought. Brilliant! She is your brain, am I right? Yes, she is. Okay. I'll accept your proposal, make me look good. Do you have a boyfriend? No. Why? One's not good enough? Pardon? Well, high school grads can only date men of that level. Is that why you flirt with everyone? Since managing director is a no go, you're after the president? I heard what you did when you were a secretary. That's why you were transferred to our team. You're not a gold digger, right? But since everyone's calling you that, you offend me as a fellow woman. I'm not the one who should be criticized. Okay, that will do. So you let that bitch go? Why are you crying? If I had some evidence back then... That freaking managing director... Don't cry! Don't tell Ja-young about it. Where did my Rambo go? It's Ja-young. Did you check it out? So? There was a real analysis report... Over 30? 50? 100? - 488? - No way... What do we do? We turn a blind eye. That's not like you. Quit the company? Why should you? What did you do wrong? But I did. Villagers trusted me and signed the settlement. I had so many different thoughts. Go to the media? Will they believe me? No, the villagers are priority, I must inform them. But that'd be irresponsible, telling them doesn't solve this. What can I do then, I thought to myself, but then... I got a page from Mr. CHOI, asking where export invoices were. So I told him. Mr. HONG asked about packing list, so I told him. Then he said the office doesn't run without me. You know what! I don't wanna make coffee, clean and file paperwork every damn day! I wanna research if epoxy is a better PCB adhesive than Phenol! You know what I always tell you! A machine that dries laundry. Not a washing machine that dries, but a separate one! I want to develop that idea! Freakin' A! I wanna change the accounting system that prevents faking receipts! Really! Really! Really! When I get promoted, I want to do some really good work! But I don't want to bet my life on this company. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and say what you want to do. Solve the Phenol problem. How? The method we failed. No! If you blow the whistle, you'll be labeled a gold digger! You got any evidence? I don't, but I got a suspect. Who? Someone who can order the factory to discharge Phenol. And who is in a position to fake the analysis results. So name names! Someone who was at the factory, recently moved to the HQ, the Managing Director. The chairman's son? That's tough, he's untouchable. I know. This is delicious. Can we walk? I'm out of breath! We have to hurry! Almost there! I can taste blood in my mouth... Let's walk, we still got 84 seconds till the last train! Ja-young, you're coming to work tomorrow? Come on! Don't give me that face! Here's what we do. Let's not decide whether to blow the whistle but obtain evidence first. How? If OH is the perpetrator, he'll react to the real report. It means his cover-up is exposed. It's like seeing someone you killed come back alive. So, we toss in the bait. Leaking it on purpose, understand? See you tomorrow. - What's with you? - What about me? You're not like you. What am I like? Rude, self-centered, and no interest in others? Girls! What? - What? - Can't hear you! Can't hear you! What? - You got no money? - No money?! - What? - I can't hear you! Thank you! Look at the first phrase. I won't stop. It's showing your will. Not just stopping, but with conviction. Phenol release - 6 months Ok-ju Factory Expenses - 1995 Would you like some? No, no. Expense this as lunch with Mirim Electronics' PARK. Yes, sir. Samjin Super Elastic Stockings May I help you? Yes, please. Samjin Managing Director Have you calculated? To get 488, even 325 tonnes of Phenol is conservative. Daily quantity as 1.87, then 173.796791, about 6 months worth. Mr. OH's term at the factory was 6 months. Looking at the expenses for that period, HQ remitted incineration funds every month, but incineration was excluded in the daily log. So they didn't. - Will he react to it? - 100%, he'll make the call. To whom? His accomplice. If Mr. OH is the one, he'll call his accomplice. Seoul National University - Environment Research Institute Phenol - 488 mg/L Production Management Team 3, LEE Ja-young speaking. Mr. HONG, it's the secretary. Who? Mr. OH? Yes, line 3 please. Yes, this is HONG Su-cheol. Yes... Ms. LEE, my PC's weird, it's very laggy. Have you defragged the hard drive? Right, defrag... I thought that's all wrapped up. Ms. LEE, I can't tell where this fax is from. See this number? This is the sender's fax. Minus that by 1, and call 2418. Very nice. I understand. - Ja-young? - Yes? Give this to Mr. OH. Yes, sir. Ok-ju Factory Waste Dumping Report 1.98? What's this? Where is AHN? He's in the board meeting. Why is he there? Re-dial Yeon-hee district. Hello? Hello? It's blowing up, record it! Did you do this? Do what? If the factory had a problem, why wasn't I notified? We sent the report, didn't you see it? Dude, how did you take care of this? My employee witnessed Phenol spill from the factory... Who? Mr. OH, is there a problem? AHN Ki-chang! Are you trying to screw me? Are you ignoring me? I get it, I get it. I understand it all now. I freaking get it! I get it now! OH Tae-young! What the hell do you know! You caused so many problems as head of the factory! Always missing deadlines, faulty parts, wasting funds! To get anything approved, I had to find you at the golf course or the bar! I thought things calmed down, now it's Phenol leak! Mr. OH, I can clean up the mess you caused outside. But this is a work place. Know your limits. But dude, seriously... Samjin's mine! What are you doing? Calm down. Calm down. What is going on? No problem. Can someone explain? What happened? I think Mr. OH misunderstood something. Misunderstood something. Ah, Mr. OH! I heard you're a troublemaker. But that's okay, I don't care. You're a Samjin family. Now, I want you to... apologize. I am sorry... Politely! I'm... I'm so sorry. I got goosebumps, I bet you were so scared. It's OH, who was scared, he got caught. Why did he lash out at Mr. AHN? Mr. AHN worked under Mr. OH, but after Billy arrived... Mr. AHN switched? Actually, Mr. OH contacted another person. Who? Seriously? You actually re-dialed? You said everyone does it. But that's in movies and novels. I thought my heart was about to burst! Amazing... 4058, whose number is it? - Yeon-hee district? - Yeon-hee? Who? Ex-president CHEON's and ROH's? The chairman. So the chairman is the accomplice? Let's follow OH first. Where did he go? Did we lose him? What's in his envelope? Irrefutable evidence. We can't all be in here! Shouldn't one of us follow him? Holy shit! What? - Hair? - What kind? I think Mr. OH did a drug test of the president. Did he do drugs? No, according to this, he's perfectly clean, negative! Even his hair is cool. Relax, gorgeous. Excuse me, miss. Do you know where the McDonald's is, by any chance? McDonald? Go out and go straight. Five minute. Okay, bye. Oh, oh come with us. - No. I am busy. - Oh come on. It will be fun. Sucker, piss off. Where's Bo-ram? Rambo... You were here? Let's eat. What the shit? Hello? His line is busy. Why don't you ever answer? I've been calling you all day. Nothing major, there is a screw up here though. I think someone's messing with me. It's about Phenol, Phenol. Even the smallest thing messes with me. Bro, this company is all mine, isn't it? Would I do anything to jeopardize it? Bro, listen to me. When I was working at the factory, I really tried to do well. But those freaking union pricks, they don't even work well, always breaking shit, asking for money to fix them, trying to scam me, so I got pissed off, and told them to throw it away because it stank as hell. Everyone does it like that, right? Someone's messing with me, the report, I mean. There are 2 reports, you know? 2 analysis reports. Father? No. The chairman doesn't know anything. I talked to him but he doesn't know anything. Do you know anything about this? If the Samjin mascot BONG doesn't know, then who? I don't know anything about this. I heard you were retiring so I went to see you but you were gone. Why was the goldfish at your desk? I was gonna put it in my office when I became the president. Billy PARK, that prick pisses me off. Bro, can I really be the president? 2 analysis reports. Father? No... It stopped in the middle. Let's eat first. Yeah, let's eat. If Mr. OH didn't manipulate it, then who was he talking to? I don't know. How are you feeling? I think I'm all right so far. Are you doing well? Did you find fun work? I did... but it's not fun anymore. Can I ask you something? Sure. What's your relationship with Mr. OH? When he started working, I taught him the ropes. Why? Does he bother you? It's about Phenol, Ok-ju factory's Phenol. It's very serious, but someone... manipulated the tests... I don't know who did it. It's me. I'm the perpetrator. Pardon? Hello, I'm calling from Samjin Electronics. Yes, sorry for calling again. Right, that business card? The one who came to ask to destroy the report, yes, I'm looking for it, I'll call you back. Didn't a SNU analysis report come to Audit Department? Strategic Planning said it was sent to you. Management Support took it. I think Legal took care of it. I was told to send it to Global Planning, so I did. What's going on? Why are you so into this? Your department took care of it, right? Who was in charge? Production Management 3 Department, your department took it. Ms. LEE, assignment. I had signs of premature labor, so I went for a checkup. Phenol was detected in my urine. Come on, that nonsense again. Mr. CHOI, talk some sense into her! As I've told you, the analysis came back safe. See? It's safe! Samjin will do right by you, no? I was someone who followed orders. That was my last task. There was a Phenol leak, and I was told it was safe, but I'm sure the leak was massive. It was an order and I put together a decent settlement package. Who ordered you? Don't try to find out. It's better that you don't. That's what corporations are like, always choosing options that minimizes losses. Maybe that's how I got cancer. Who is it? Dad needs surgery soon, but we got no money. There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry... No, I'm the one sorry. Wait a minute. Were you studious in school? - Pardon? - You work at Samjin. I think... I studied hard. I wanted to work in Seoul. Looks weird, right? It's because we don't use pesticide, try it. Our apples are really sweet. I'll pack some for you, share it with your colleagues. - Here, here. - Thank you. - I can do that. - It's fine! That business card of the man who asked to destroy the report... - Did you find it? - I can't find it. It's weird, I thought I received his card. No, it's okay, thank you. But I remember his face, how can I put it... He looked ordinary. Totally an office worker type. Did he wear glasses or not? I think he did, or maybe not... Anyway, he wanted his coffee in a peculiar way. That I remember for sure. Coffee? Most people take coffee, whitener and sugar in 2-2-2, 2-2-3 or 2-3-2 ratio, right? Yes. But he took 1-1-1. 1-1-1. How's the English study going? It'd be nice for you to get promoted after passing the test. You'll do really well. You're tenacious, right? Are you tired? It all worked out, made good with the village foreman, I don't think we need to come back here again. We'll be back, nothing's solved. Everything's solved! 325 tonnes of Phenol was leaked for 6 months since March this year. And HQ covered it up by manipulating the report. They committed these 2 crimes, and tried to make it go away by spending less than $20,000. They don't know why the villagers are sick or how much they're sick. So they just ignored it, right? Stop the car, stop it. Jesus... LEE Ja-young. Since I respected you, you forgot your place? I told you to turn a blind eye from the very start! Whose fault is that I'm having such a tough time? You're all worked up over nothing... That hurts! Ms. LEE, that hurts! It hurts? How could you only notice your own pain? Did you play volleyball? Who ordered you to destroy the SNU analysis? How did you know that? I'm not supposed to tell. - Mr. CHOI! - Yes, Ms. LEE. I wrote everything down just in case. Because I get blamed for everything. Here, it was this day. I was drinking in Jong-ro when I got a page. It was around midnight, I was told to go to the office, and shred the analysis report Global Planning Department sent. Then I was told to go to SNU in the morning, and destroy the original report. Who ordered you? Mr. AHN, he gave me the American report, he said not to tell Mr. HONG, and proceed the settlement with it. Due to the foreman's objection, make it look like we sent it to USA? Yes, that's right. But I knew this was all wrong, so I asked him, How will you handle it if this backfires? then he said: "No problem, it's all taken care of". No one upstairs will cause a stink over it. Upstairs? Who? I... don't know that. It feels so good to get it all out. So no more Phenol leaks after what I witnessed? Probably, it hasn't rained. Rain? You didn't know? They said they leak it whenever it rains. Oh yeah, what day is it today? Mr. AHN said something big will blow up, really big, so he told me to be cool, and act normal. Reports of stench from tap water are increasing. According to the authorities, factory wastewater has leaked into the reservoir, and the stench came from mixing chlorine and Phenol. The amount of Phenol detected is 110 times the safe amount, in other words, the tap water has become the water of death. The prosecution is investigating factories near Ok-ju stream, especially Samjin which produces printed circuit boards. Listen carefully to what I say. If the prosecutors ask, say yes, no, I don't know. It means don't blabber on. Yes, sir! What about the documents? Phenol leak and aftermath reports. - Are they clean? - Yes, yes! You knew about this? Be quiet! Everyone stay alert, the prosecutors are smart, they're no easy foes. Just say I don't know? I'm not sure, can't think of it, I don't remember, mix it up. Get creative with I don't know variations. Hang in there, it'll be a week at most. Mr. Prosecutor, I have to go support the Finance team. Our stock's tanking, so it's really crazy here. Go ahead. Okay. Sir. I visited... the factory last month... Miss? Yes? Could you get me some smokes? 2 packs, please. Apologize! Apologize! Denounce illegal dumping of Phenol! Denounce! Denounce! Samjin must apologize! Apologize! Apologize! Boycott Samjin products! Boycott! Boycott! Denounce illegal dumping of Phenol! Denounce! Denounce! Samjin must apologize! Apologize! Apologize! Boycott Samjin products! Boycott! Boycott! - Been a while. - Yeah. What's up? Do you still have the number for the reporter we contacted? Where's Bo-ram? Let's go upstairs. This has been reported before. You worked hard for this, but none of it is usable. The villagers didn't get compensated at all. That's because they signed the settlement. Big corporations are very meticulous. Can they get compensated if they file a class action lawsuit? Samjin will drag it out, but the settlement is still a problem. If only there was proof... that Samjin HQ knew about it, but systematically covered it up. Smoking gun? Yes, irrefutable evidence. I'm thinking of quitting. Why? I'm scared to go to work... Do what you want to do. I don't know what I want to do. Then what do you not want to do? There's a lot of that. I hate our uniform, it's uncomfortable. I hate being labelled a high school grad. I hate getting bumped into on the way to work, no one has any manners! And being treated like a little girl, I'm almost 30. And forced smile. I guess I'm easy to pick on, so I have to smile and gauge everyone's mood. Like this, I think I'll cry from smiling so much. I absolutely can't stand cheating with numbers. I feel bad for the numbers. You're sure of what you hate. You're doing well. Pardon? If you don't know what you like, just do anything. Then maybe you'll find something you like. Can't I stand still? But that's no fun. Rain stopped. Ms. LEE, I can't tell where this fax is from. See this number? This is the sender's fax. Minus that by 1, and call 2418. Let's go. Eh? It's Seoul? You know this too, right? Normally, the fax number is just the phone number minus 1. If the number is 771, it's nearby... It's Myeong-dong! Myeong-dong! Like hell it's California, I got you now! But often the two numbers are completely different. I get more excited when you spoil the mood. I'm so dumb, why did I figure this out now? But at least I know now. Samjin Hotel front desk, how can I help you? Let's go to the front and ask, they'll have the fax record! You really didn't see anything in Mr. OH's hotel room? Excuse me, miss. Do you know where the McDonald's is, by any chance? Mr. AHN, he gave me the American report, and said to proceed settlement with it. No one upstairs will cause a stink over it. Upstairs? Who? This really was a murder disguised as a smog death. We know the perp, we just need solid evidence. Go to the front, get the fax record, and they'll deny it, so we need security cam footage! We need to get inside that room, how do we do that? It's the 17th floor, so rappel down from the roof? But the window will be locked. Then we break the window, that's what we do. You're nuts. Do you know why office workers can't be detectives? We got neither time nor authority. Spoiling the mood again. Girls! I got it! I heard it from Mr. BONG! Billy! Our president is the perpetrator! Eh? You already knew? I bet you didn't know this. What's this? Mr. BONG gave it to us. Mr. AHN asked him to calculate the settlement payouts. This was in the documents. He didn't know what it meant back then. But she figured it out. She's a math genius, who won an Olympiad. So 3.28ft you see there is converted to 1m... It's the factory's pipe diameter. 65 yards refers to the stream's width, 488 is amount of Phenol leaked... So what? So, using constant e, imaginary i with Euler's formula... In short, approximate date of the Phenol leak going public... And the amount of leak were calculated beforehand. Who did? American? A math genius from MIT? But someone else probably masterminded this. Billy PARK, that son of a bitch. Sir. You're the only one who can save the company. Fax log 771-9535. Oh no, everything's in English. People work the same way, documents are formatted the same. Medical Report Eh? Bear Hug Project? Bear Hug means big hug... Bear Hug? Cheers! I love Korean style! Brilliant work! Absolutely brilliant! It's this little boy! Rambo... TOEIC Test Questionnaire Proverbs frequently come up on TOEIC You freaking bitches! You're under arrest for water quality and ecosystem violations. Headline is 'Full Account of Samjin Co.'s Phenol Case.' Add another, 'CEO Billy PARK Ordered Cover-up.' Okay, show me the photos. Doesn't he look despicable here? Lead story on the front page. Thank you! Over here, say cheese! Boss, one more! One more! He's so photogenic! Samjin Group Develops Eco TV I was told you asked it to be on the front page. Mr. YOON, what happened? Isn't it obvious? My editor blocked it. What about the docs? Smoking gun? They took everything. What about copies? I told you to make some. They even searched those and took them. Those corporation pricks sure are meticulous. This world will never change. You 3 sure are shrews, being all nosy. This can't be the work of high school grads. All getting fired? That's least of it, the company's suing them. Sue them for what? We all signed non-disclosure agreement when we were hired. They'll be fined a few hundred thousand. They didn't do anything wrong. I'll take full responsibility. Is the world getting worse? Back in the day, sky, people and others were great. But people nowadays only care about themselves, and the society is rotting. Even so, one mustn't say, Things were better in the old days, so recklessly. It's irresponsible to say for those who never lived it. Just as it was an important time for me, I hope it's just as beautiful to someone. So they just got a pay cut? Mr. BONG said he'd take full responsibility for them. He said he ordered everything. Company people didn't even show up because he was a whistleblower. He dedicated his entire life to Samjin, he ruined it all in the end. He was bragging that his kid got into a big company, why isn't anyone from there here for the funeral? They can't come all the way from Seoul. BONG Hyun-cheol Oh my, he still hasn't left? The funeral was dead since he didn't have any relatives. He's Bo-ram's boss. Studying English is about repeating, there is a point where your skill jumps instinctively, got it? Don't give up, okay? Please don't give up. - Yes. - Of course! Ms. LEE? Ms. LEE! They told me not to be friends with you. It's so childish. CHOI Dong-su! Don't even chat with her, who knows what she might do. If it was me, I'd have resigned already. You got all your stuff taken away. We should go, sir. Ms. SONG, do you understand? Destroy everything here? No, burn them, go to the roof and have a smoke too. What do you mean, sir! I don't smoke. I forgot about something, a new karaoke opened. Wanna go sing since we're all in a foul mood? LEE Ja-young! SHIM Bo-ram! Let's go! Where? The English class! Extra classes from today, are you hungry? We're all doing this to live, we should eat first. Got any croissant? Eat whatever, we're really late. You freaking bitches! You gals are too much! Study English for a damn promotion? JUNG Yu-nah! When Mr. GWAK was harassing you, you were crying like a bitch. Remember what I did? I kicked his Mercedes! Smashed his side mirror! She's right! SHIM Bo-ram! When you sprained your ankle while hopping fence for losing keys, who took you to the ER? I even paid for the treatment! $98.30! $98.30... If you unsheathe your sword, you gotta cut something! Forget it, just go! I'm not giving up! I'm so lonely! Why are you crying? Don't cry... Yo, Dorothy. That's why we should go to the extra class. We haven't unsheathed our swords yet. Life at work is a series of betrayals. I don't know about this. Finances? So many difficult words. Pulling all-nighter isn't enough. Don't spoil the mood. They must've worked all night. They're going all out. Will you look the other way? Don't try to be the hero, this concerns us too. Korea Bar Let's begin. Okay everybody, TOEIC Part 7. Bear hug. This phrase came up in the exam 2 years ago. It's not literal bear hug, but a business lingo. This is an acquisition strategy, in which a company is forced out of a situation. Who exactly is Billy PARK? A famous Wall Street consultant, scouted by the chairman, but he has ties to Global Capital. A corporate mole. Global Capital plan resale Japanese electronics company. Meaning, Global Capital is planning to resell a Japanese electronics company. So what kind of company is Global Capital? They buy up shares of their target companies, and use that as leverage for short-term gains. In other words, raiders, corporate raiders. S Corp as the target. A company called S is the target, in other words, Global Capital is acquiring S, only to resell it to a Japanese company. In short, 'Eat and Run'. Take off without paying. Billy had only one goal, drop the stock price. So that Global Capital can hoard our shares on the cheap. Ja-young witnessed the Phenol leak, and the president exploited this. He knew when it got out, the shares would plummet, so he didn't stop the leak, he accelerated it. Mystery solved. Fabricated the analysis, got settlements, covered up the truth. The main course starts here. Global Capital will openly propose a merger between 2 companies. Look at this, a flight is already booked. Billy will fly out to America on this day. To summarize, the board will sell off the company, Billy takes off, then the villagers will never get compensated, and we'll get fired. Crap! I poured my youth into this company! Not on my watch! We have to stop this, no matter what! Legal, do you know any lawyers? We got solid evidence right here! These are stolen docs, they can't stand in the court. What we need now is a dynamite. Here they come. We're late, Ms. LEE. You said you knew the way, we just went round and round. Mrs. KIM! I missed you! I brought twisty breadsticks! - You're the bomb! - So cool! It'll work, you don't think so? I think it will. - Not sure. - Maybe not. Wait... What about contacting the chairman first? The most likely method is, going after the most risky option first. I think that's the highest probability of winning. As I told you, it'll be handled very quickly. Yes, yes... These employees will be laid off, maybe 60%. Shareholders? I'll simply tell them, this is globalization and they will be okay. Yes. Of course, Samjin is just the beginning. We must take over as many Korean companies as possible. I'm going back on Monday, let's choose the next target company. Yeah. Good morning, Yu-jin. Just for you. Wow. Surprise party? Mr. Chairman. You ungrateful prick! This is that global standard you promised me? I got it all wrong. A corporation is best when it's small. As it grows, it's hard to maintain control. I can't downsize, because people's livelihood is depended on this company. CHOI! PARK! KANG! You spineless pricks! What were you all doing while Samjin went down the gutter? What's going on? So you guys are Global Capital! I won't sell you my company, yankee go home! Yankee? Mr. Chairman, calm down. Like hell I will! You're fired, asshole! Mr. Chairman, if you are done, please leave. What? You can't fire me. This is not your company anymore. Samjin Group is a corporation. And I kept my promise to make Samjin a global corporation. Korean style conglomerate, successive management. I got rid of that. That's what you wanted. And your son's Phenol problem, what a huge disaster! But I got foreign investment and I saved the company. You should be thanking me. Billy! That document tells a different story! Ms. JUNG. I've absolutely no idea what's on those pieces of papers. How dare you! Global Capital is a shareholder of Samjin Electronics with 31.59% equity. Samjin Electronics will reduce dependence on human resources and restructure to pursue M&A with Sekai Electronics in Japan. Everyone agreed, okay? No! English teacher was right, instinctively. I can understand English now. I get the gist of it too. Who the hell are these people? Nobody. Even a worm will turn! What? Will you just... Just... Just shut up! Just shut the fuck up! You! Are. Wrong. You cannot sell our company. Are you threatening me, bitch? I am not bitch, and you said Samjin is corporation company. So you have to ask the shareholders. Right? Come on. You can't change this situation. I know. I am tiny, tiny person. But... how about this? What the hell is that? Dynamite. Ms. LEE! You wrote the very first Phenol leak report, right? He already knew, even though he's prickly... What's your plan? You don't work for an insurance company? I told you, I work for a stockbroker. The president always says, Samjin is a corporation. We have to use it to our advantage. Convince the shareholders? Is merger good for the shareholders? Management dispute increases stock for a bit, but not for long. In long term, the shares will be a third of its value. Could I get your signature? Let's see. Why are you doing so much for this damn company? I thought my company was making things that enriched people's lives. But if my work is ultimately hurting those people, what am I working for? To make money? To simply survive? I spend most of my waking hours here, I want that to be meaningful. And I want my work to help people. Stake of people here is 38.9%. The shareholder agreements add up to 39.1%, taking account of +/- 0.001%, in English, we win. The agreement content is simple. Enjoy World Global Samjin's merger will be determined at the shareholders' meeting. What? Impossible! There is no impossible. Because we are... great... Stop them! CHOI Dong-su, are you nuts? How dare you come in here! - Open the door! - Open up! Fuck! Fuck! Goddammit! The prosecution arrested 6 Samjin employees and Managing Director OH Tae-young, as well as President Billy PARK for violating Water Quality Conservation Act. Shareholders showed up en masse, and 68.3% of them voted to reject the merger. A new CEO will be appointed at their next board meeting. Samjin's Chairman OH Soon-cheol made an official apology. Samjin will also compensate the victims with $130,000 each, and vowed to complete its recycling program in Ok-ju. Like you said, we're back here again. I'll go visit the foreman and the village elders. 47th TOEIC English Examination I can do it, you can do it, we can do it! TOEIC!
