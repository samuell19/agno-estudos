The Siku 12 Langkah Derhaka in this film is based on... ...the teachings of Master Haji Zainal Abidin. Our village head is here. Boon, here's the profit from the paddy field. What is this? Is our paddy field high-yielding, Man? Yes, Boon. Actually, just like before, there are paddy snails,... ...white grubs, long droughts, all kinds of problems. Yes, but don't forget. Do not burn the straws. Man Gagak Asam Jawa was just fined for it. If we don't look after it, who would? Do not burn the straws. Boon, we have a unique village. Malays and Thais are close like siblings. If people don't know you, they'll think you're Malay. But with slanted eyes. How Malay is that? Elbow hit. Knee stab. Why are you here this early? -Just to get some fresh air. I'm just keeping my brother company. Are you here for your brother, or the other one? Who? Atid? -Stop pretending. No, thanks. I'm not interested. Villagers look at my brother as if he's a superhero. But deep inside, he's yours alone. How can I win like this? Why? -Chiyapon is two-time champion. Atid, just ignore Chiyapon and his two, three-time record. This year you will win. -True! Let's train. Let's take a rest. -Why? I'm thirsty. -You rascal. I'm just a village girl. Why would a village hero like Atid would want a Thai girl like me? Whatever it is, one of these days... ...Ayah Man will get himself a daughter-in-law. Don't be ridiculous. Go and make drinks. Why must it be me? -You're the host! Go make drinks. You! If Chiyapon competes this year, what do you think? Can you and Atid win? I'm confident the two of you could do it. Easy to say, Nawari. The one getting hit would be me. What's the discussion here? I'm going to the surau. -Yes, dad. Wut, I have to go now. Who's going with you? Don't worry. I will go with her. Don't forget to buy Panadol for dad. Okay. What's wrong with your father? You can speak the Thai language? A little. Dad is unwell. He was rained on upon returning from a feast. Wut, I have to go now. Excuse us. I am doing my best this year. I really want to win. Let's get back to training. What's the matter? Are you scared of the competition? It's not that. I was just thinking... ...what if the two of us are in the final? You and me? I'd knee you in the face. You think I won't elbow you back? I'm just joking. If we are to meet in the ring in the final,... ...let's leave it to Allah. Right? I'm proud of you. Why? You're a Thai man, but when you're with the Malays,... ...you're more Malay than us. It's true. Atid, A-Wut,... ...come help me pick up the bags of rice. Okay, dad. Go home, everyone. What happened? Go home. What move did dad use? Why don't I know it? Is that it? -There's more. Push it further. -There's more. What are you doing? You picked one, there's one left. Go get it. Husin. -Have you had dinner? I'm still full. I don't eat much at night. How's your business? Praise be to God. Everything is fine. That's good. The paddy machine you sent to Perlis and Perak,... ...have you got it back? -Yes. Everything's settled. Another thing, those land we leased,... ...how about them? -They're okay too, Tok Wan. That's good, Husin. You have to work hard. You are the one to continue the work that I have done. What happened to you? Ayah Man beat us, Tok Wan. Ayah Man? How dare you, Syeikh Rahman! You continue to harass me. Husin. You have to take revenge. Look at me. This happened to me... ...because of Syeikh Rahman. Go find him. Go get him and bring him here, and tell him... ...that he still owes me. I will do that, Tok Wan. I will take revenge. Boon. What are we doing here? What's the plan? Everything is fine, sir. -Everything is okay? Yes, sir. The participation looks good as well. But, last year's champion is not returning. Chiyapon will not be joining. That means we have a chance to win! Why didn't you tell me earlier? That's true. Our village boys are excellent too. Let's not think Chiyapon is the only one. For example, Boon's son A-Wut. -Atid, Ayah Man's son. The boys in our village are doing well too. If that's the case, let's gather all of them,... ...all those wonderful kid and register with us. I have already told the Chief Minister... ...I've chosen Padang Pusing. -That's good. It's near Sik, his home town Jeneri. Who's doing the publicity? -The committee, you mean? Yes. -Farid, sir. Call him. -Farid! Yes. Here's Farid, sir. Farid, how's the preparation? It's done. Thank you for coming here to help me publicize our village. I am truly thankful,... ...especially Ben here. I heard you're going to Australia. Really? I should be in Australia right now. But for your sake,... ...I will find well-known players... ...to be a part of this. -That's good. Sir, I have already distributed all the flyers. I have distributed it everywhere. Ipoh, Perak, Kedah,... ...all the way to Perlis. Throughout all the corners and recesses. That is good, Farid. There's one more thing. I need to tell you. What is it? -Some money. I hope you can give some money for them to buy drinks. I thought you were talking about pretty girls. It's okay. Don't worry. If that's not enough, ask Boon for more. Is that okay, Boon? -Yes. No problem. Don't forget the receipt. Tell everybody, and post it everywhere. From Tobiar, Pendang, Alor Setar to Perlis. Let them know. I've told the Chief Minister too. He has agreed as well to make Kedah... ...the biggest centre for tomoi. That's great. -So, I can ride on it too. Let's collaborate. If everything is fine, please excuse me. I'm going to Din Biawak's place. He's doing a circumcision feast. It won't be good for me not to go. That's good. -It's late already. Thank you. Send my regards to Din Biawak. -Alright. God willing. Thank you, sir. -Okay, you're welcome. Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you too. What are you doing, Atid? That looks weird. Your tea is here. Sister,... ...last night I saw dad defeating four people... ...in just a second. Something like this. That hurts! You think I am not good at tomoi? What are you doing? If you're dancing you should... ...watch the rhythm and the steps. If you want to do zapin, don't do the inang steps,... ...or it will be all over the place. Here. What is that? Muay Thai Open in Pendang, Kedah. Are you going to compete? That's what I'm planning to ask dad. Last night, you were..... What move is that? Move, you say? See? Nafishah, isn't this pretty? So beautiful, dad. Who is it for? It's for your little brother. For his lady. He and his lady. -Shut up. Dad, I need to know that move you made last night. What move is that? Tell me. Take this. Fishah,... ...have you cooked? -I have, dad. All is ready, the rice is also cooked. We can eat now. Let's go and eat. Let's eat, he says. Look at that old guy. He ignored my question. Ladies and gentlemen, I hereby... ...launch the Songkran Festival... ...for this village in the year of 2021. Thank you. Who are you looking at? So beautiful. -Who? My sister? No, I mean your culture. I am..... -There's no water! There's no water. -No? I want that one. Give me the one with water in it. So, you guys are staring at the ladies? What perverts. Take these. -Then, should I look at you? You shouldn't..... You have such a beautiful voice. If I'm not mistaken,... ...that song is about a Thai girl... ...who loves her husband to the end of time. What a beautiful Thai legend. The story of Mae Nak waiting by the river of..... Phra Khanong? -That one! I've read the love story... ...between Anthony and Cleopatra. But how different is it... ...with a Malay legendary love story? Like Tuah and Teja. -That is right. Grandpa. Grandpa! Can you see him? -Yes. What is he doing? -He's fishing. Aside from that? Aside from that, I can see a goat and the trees. Don't do that. I'm always praying... ...for us to always be as happy as grandpa. To still be in love at his age. Except..... -Atid. I understand... ...that we are of different races and religions. But how can those differences... ...prevent us from being together? That's true. But what confuses me... ...is..... A-Wut? A-Wut has chosen his own path. Even if I choose you,... ...it's not just because of you. I also believe in God's guidance. I have a gift... ...for you. What is this? It's so big. But I want you to know,... ...that I also believe in God's guidance. I know that both of us have to believe in fate. It's beautiful. Ayah Man made it himself. About him. Didn't you say before that you were surprised.... ...that Ayah Man defeated those guys? It's not because of that, Nawari. I need to know what move did he use... ...that he was able to beat them that fast. I'm sure he learned that and not tell me about it. Have you asked him? I did, Nawari. But every time I asked... ...what moves he used that he can beat them all,... ...he just ignored me. I don't get him. Atid,... ...you have to respect his principle. Maybe the knowledge he has is not to be shared with others. Yes, but he could at least tell me. If it's silat, tell me if it's kuntau or sendeng. Are you sure it's not Muay Thai? I know it's not. Not Muay Thai, and not tomoi. What I need to know is what my dad knows. At least I can use it for the Muay Thai Championship. Then, I will be more confident. Right? Why are you laughing? Do you think I can't win? Of course you can. A-Wut will lose to you as well. That's what I want to hear. Let's go. It's okay. Get into the boat first. Let's go bother grandpa. Get in. Peace be upon you, Ayah Man. Peace be upon you too, Husin. -Pak Boon too. How are you? -We're fine. Praise be to God. Ayah Man, my grandfather sends his regards. He said that you owe him. When did I owe him? -Is this right, Husin? No need to meddle. He says you owe him. -I don't think so. But how about this? How are we going to settle this? How are we going to settle it? Let's settle it this way! What's with these boys? I told you, A-Wut. That is not Muay Thai. -It's not. That is not Muay Thai. It's different. I think you should ask your dad. It will be a waste not to learn it. I've asked him. But you know how he is. He'll just ignore you and not tell you his secret. You should ask him again. Maybe he wants to see... ...how determined you are. Me? How about you? You try and ask him. Maybe he'll tell you. I am not his son. I am his son and he's still not telling. I should be the one saying that. You're like a son to him. That is right. Idiots! The whole lot of you! What a waste of physique! Husin,... ...relax. We still have other ways. If we can't get through the father,... ...we'll get the son. Find this guy. Bring him to me. This is great. Let's see how a mouse fights a Siamese cat. I suppose Husin's men just got back from the club. They're drunk and ready to fight. Peace be upon you, Husin. Why are you all here? Husin! Can I ask,... ...why are you coming here with all your men? Are you playing futsal? Do you know who you're talking to? I know. I'm talking to Husin Lang Merah. The big paddy transplant guy from Kampung Pala Kecil. You rascal! Tell your father... ...his debt with Tok Wan is still unpaid. It's still unpaid. Hey, kid! Man, aren't you going to the police? Come on, Boon. Do you not know us? We don't go to the police. You remember when we were young? This is normal. They're men. We just fight back, that's the only way. Skin to skin. Mum, don't worry. I know what I will do. Do not make any trouble again. Do not use your emotions. You want to get hurt even more before going to the police? Yes, mum. A-Wut? Husin has been vindictive of you for a long time. We have to do something, otherwise he will keep doing this. Those repossession men are all his people, Ayah Man. His family has been vindictive of me for a long time now. He thought I incapacitated his grandfather. I never even touched him. Husin has been spreading that same story. But God is fair, Ayah Man. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you to. How are you, Mat? -I'm well. I don't want to say more. I think you know. I am here today... ...to get my payment. It's not that I don't want to pay,... ...but... ...my paddy is not yielding. So,... ...I am asking you... ...to delay the payment. Can you do that? Delay it? Delay it? Who is that? I have never seen him before. You have a help too? No, Leh. This is Sheikh Rahman. He is from Pattani. He just arrived a month ago. He has been helping me clear the field. I don't care if he is from Pattani, Hat Yai, Sadao,... ...Golok or Padang Besar. You still have to pay your debt. Understand? Listen here. -What now? You have to understand that my field has no yield. Understand? Who do you think you are? You're just a loan shark. You've leeched the whole village. You called me a shark? A loan shark? You rascal! If you ask me, Atid,... ...as soon as my arm is fine,... ...I will find Husin and his men. I will not let even one go. A-Wut, do not be rash. Don't go on your own. Take me with you. How are you going with me if a slap hurts you that bad? I'll be braver since you'll be there. But really. I am a Thai man. I was taught to respect others, to regard the good people... ...like you and your family. But Husin Lang Merah has to be taught a lesson... ...to finally have a brain. Listen carefully. I want you to join the Muay Thai Championship. Yes. -Make sure it's done. Okay. Husin, move. What are you doing? What's the matter? I don't know. I'm not feeling well. Are you sick? -No. I have to go now. -Alright. Just go. Let's continue tomorrow. A-Wut? Where is he going? Come. Is it so hard for you to tell me? Just tell me! Righteousness cannot be killed. None moves, not even a particle,... ...without Allah's permission. Silat Halilintar... ...the Pelaga school,... ...in the style of Siku 12. Siku 12? In the past,... ...I learned it from the late Pak Bidin... ...when I was your age. Siku 12 united me with all my enemies... ...who then became my comrade. Harun. I owed Harun my life... ...and I made a vow to never teach it to anybody... ...even my own children. Why would you not... ...pass such a good thing to me? You have to remember what I told you. Take this as your guide. Righteousness cannot be killed. Righteousness cannot be killed. -Yes. It cannot be killed. Good night, and peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. Make sure you take Aina home before you go back. Yes, Pak Bidin. See you soon. Go home safely. God willing. Do not be late. Pak Bidin. Peace be upon you, sir. Man, Harun, come here for a second. Pak Bidin wants to teach us more moves. Pak Bidin is going to teach us more of the style. This is the book of our teachings. The trust that I have kept with me all this time. As my successor, take care of this trust. Remember, trust is the backbone... ...of our manners and morals as Muslims. Take this. We will accept it, Pak Bidin. -Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Praise be to God. -I've told you about the book. We should be grateful he gave it to us. Help! What's happening here? Man. -Let's go. Kid, get up. Harun! Man. -Harun! Man. Goodness. -He is just a kid. Man. -He is just a kid. You should leave here, Man. Listen to me. -What about the kid? It's fine. I will take care of him. No, Man. Go home, get your wife,... ...and go back to Pattani. I will take care of the kid. Listen to me! Man! Go home. Listen to me. Go! Just go! I ran back to your mother's village in Pattani. Harun sacrificed a lot for me. He died in prison. I couldn't forgive myself,... ...not even now. Darling,... ...what now? I'm sorry, dad. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I know Siku 12 is still in you. Dad,... ...I really need you. Please teach me the moves. I can defeat all of my enemies. I really want to win this time. Siku 12. Dad..... Do you want to see me get beaten up by Husin's men? That's enough. Dad, I know... ...that you can't forgive yourself. You lost your best friend. But you will lose me too if you don't teach it to me. It took me seven years to master it. You want to learn it in three days here? I will try. I am sure I can. What happened? Who did this to you? A-Wut. That rascal. Take this weapon and go find A-Wut. Yes, sir. Husin. Yes, Tok Wan? Do not return until you get him. Come and eat. Come try this, Fishah. It's really good. It's been a while since I saw you. Come and eat. Who is that? We're having lunch right now. Who is that? Pak Boon. Yes, Husin. Are you having lunch? -Yes. Come join us. Why didn't you serve me? -Go on. This is delicious. I have to ask. -Yes? Where is A-Wut? -How would I know? He's been away for weeks. You don't know? -No. You don't know? -Hey! Let me ask you again. Where is A-Wut? -I don't know. Husin. -Where is A-Wut? Husin. -Where is A-Wut? Hey! If you want to fight,... ...come and taste my elbow. Fight someone your own size, don't fight them. It's okay. Tell A-Wut, my grandfather is looking for him. My grandfather is looking for him. It's okay. Don't worry about those men. I am here. Atid, take care of yourself. A-Wut! A-Wut. Let's fight. A-Wut, come on. -Ladies and gentlemen,... ...let's welcome my little brother, Atid Rahman. Ladies and gentlemen,... ...let's welcome my big brother... ...A-Wut Prakason. Start! Come on, A-Wut. A-Wut. -Fight me. No, A-Wut! -Fight me. No! No, A-Wut! A-Wut! A-Wut. Can I talk to you? What about? My name is Ben Mustaza. I am an agent for all international athletes... ...in extreme sports like yours. I can see that you can go far. You have the potential. How about you let me become your manager? Let me manage you. What do you think? A manager? What is the need for a manager? That is a good question! Why would you need a manager? Because a manager... ...who will help you get the best coach... ...and to organise your schedule... ...and get you great competitions. International level, I mean. Not just here. You can just focus on hitting this thing. Right? I will settle all those things. All those Chattapoongs, Rattapoongs and those guys,... ...it'd be easy fight for you. Let me manage everything. What do you think? You manage everything? You take care of it? I'll cover everything, that is if you want. If you don't, it's fine. I can find another fighter. There is no problem. Then take care of my gloves. Do I start now? Yes. Rebellious move. It's confirmed, Tok Wan. Ayah Man's son will be competing this year. The same goes with A-Wut. Chiwadong. Yes. I want you to really hurt the kid. Yes, sir. Hurt him good. He will die. Okay. I've registered you for Pendang Open. So, you are officially a professional fighter. You have to win because last year's champion Chiyapon... ...are not in competition. You have to win. But Atid is competing. Which Atid? I have never heard of him. Who is he? You should mention someone more popular. I don't care about Atid. I just want you to remember only one name. When you're in the ring, the winner is... ...A-Wut Prakason. He nearly hit my face. It would have scrambled my brain. A-Wut! After you beat up Husin's men, you're hiding here? You think I wouldn't find you? There's two more days before the championship. I want to train with you. What's the matter? The owl wants to reach the moon,... ...but it can never get to it. Why are you being poetic? Go and be poetic with my sister. I don't understand it. Explain. Muay Thai is about soul and body. There can't be spite and envy. I know that. But what I don't get right now is you. Blind people have no understanding of night and day. What day and what night? Explain it to me. Do not ask me. You know it better. I know. I know. My dad and I have made a plan. We will..... Do you truly desire to win? We are both men. Let's meet in the ring. What are you talking about, A-Wut? If I want to kill you, I will kill you in the ring. You came here yourself. Why are you bruised? No, I am not here to fight. I am here to be an ally. Do not be ridiculous! After beating my men, you come here to be an ally? I am serious. -How convenient for you. How convenient! Husin. Tok Wan. How dare you come to my place? I want to hear his story. If it meets my fancy, let's be allies. Otherwise,... ...you know what this is? You know this? -I do. Here. I'll take a seat. This is the schedule for tomorrow's fight. I know... ...you have your grudge against Ayah Man. What are you talking about? What I want is for me to get my revenge. Here's my plan. Where has he been? A-Wut, Atid was looking for you. Did you find him? You should just be quiet. What's the matter? Look at this. Atid gave it to me. Ayah Man made it. Pretty, isn't it? What's the matter? A-Wut, what's wrong? Listen here. I do not want you to mention Atid or Ayah Man any more. One more thing. If I find out that you went to see Atid,... ...just you wait. -Why not? If you need to know, just ask Ayah Man himself. What's the matter, A-Wut? -Why are you like this? All this time,... ...I thought that they were sincere with me. But it turns out, they are selfish! A-Wut! Why would you do this? -Why? Do you love Atid so much? Listen here. By destroying this box,... ...it means I have erased them from my life. I want you to do the same. Erase him from your life. But why would you do this? -Why are you being stubborn? A-Wut, are you mad? I don't want you to see him! I hope you can come here. I'll wait by the entrance. Without further ado, let's watch the first fight... ...between A-Wut Prakason and Pijon Raja Rimba. Start! The winner is... ...Chiwadong the Dragon! Start! Get up! Start! Give a round of applause... ...for your winner, Atid Rahman! Atid! Atid! Start! -Fight him! Start! We are now in the semifinal... ...of Pendang Muay Thai Open 2021. Next we will have... ...the first semifinal fight between Chiwadong... ...and Tiger Affendi. The next fight, we will see... ...the fight of two siblings... ...between Atid Rahman... ...and A-Wut Prakason! Start! Beat him! Sister, where's dad? Dad? He went to see his friend earlier. Congratulations, Atid. Get to the final, okay? Thank you, sir. Start! -Fight him! Now the second fight, between Atid Rahman... ...and A-Wut Prakason! Stay seated! Pak Leh,... ...what did I do? I have waited long for this moment. I want to confront you. I want you to feel what I felt. What did I do, Pak Leh? Syeikh Rahman,... ...I still remember the first day I lost my ability to walk. I was paralysed and I needed the wheelchair. Today, I want you to be as paralysed as I am. That was your own fault. Pak Leh,... ...I will admit defeat,... ...but allow me to let us finish this as men. Come! Husin? I am Syeikh Rahman. Siku... ...12. Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! A-Wut! A-Wut! A-Wut! A-Wut! A-Wut! A-Wut! A-Wut! A-Wut! A-Wut! A-Wut! You want to win so much, right? -Let's do it like in training. Nobody is winning. -Stop trying to act kind here. Like father like son. You will use Siku 12 to defeat me. How would you know that? -I know, Atid. It's fine. Let's see if Siku 12 or Muay Thai will win. Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! A-Wut! A-Wut! A-Wut! A-Wut! Start! Start! Up! Start! Start! Get up! Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! Look at me! A-Wut, enough! I want to kill him! -A-Wut, enough! A-Wut! A-Wut! Start! Get up! Atid? Atid? Open your eyes. If you think you're being mistreated,... ...this is the time for you to use it. The rebellious moves of Siku 12. Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! A-Wut. Do you really want to kill me, A-Wut? What did I do to you? Siku 12 is not a secret. It was for us. Siku 12 is for us. Siku 12? Siku 12? Siku 12. Come use your Siku 12. Come on! Come on! Come on! A-Wut! A-Wut, get up! A-Wut! A-Wut. Who will be the winner... ...of Pendang Muay Thai Open 2021? Let's await the final fight tomorrow night... ...between Chiwadong... ...who will be competing with... ...Atid Rahman! Let's meet tomorrow night! I am just selfish, Atid. Forget about it, A-Wut. That's why you should never be emotional. You are more worthy... ...of learning Siku 12. It's true,... ...because you are Ayah Man's true heir,... ...and not me. So, tomorrow... ...you have to win. Not just me, A-Wut. But you and me. After this championship,... ...I want you to go see Ayah Man. Ladies and gentlemen, introducing in the red corner,... ...the seven-year champion of Muay Thai Pendang,... ...A-Wut Prakason. Ladies and gentlemen, introducing in the blue corner..... Announcing. The champion of Pendang... ...Muay Thai Open 2021! Atid Rahman. You have to win. Thank you, A-Wut. -You're welcome. Siku 12. They have done their best. But only one name can emerge as champion. Who will be the final winner... ...of Pendang Muay Thai Open 2021? We will witness the fight between Chiwadong the Dragon... ...against Atid Rahman! Atid! Atid! Atid! Atid! Do your best. Chiwadong! Chiwadong! Chiwadong! Chiwadong! Chiwadong! Chiwadong! Chiwadong! Chiwadong! Chiwadong! Chiwadong! Chiwadong, keep our promise. -Okay. Chiwadong. -Start. Start! -Chiwadong. Up! Start! Up! Start! Do not play around here in Padang Pusing! You'll pay for this. What more do you want? You, Atid. Let's fight again. Chiwadong, what now? That's enough. Sir, do not get yourself involved. This is between Atid and Chiwadong. Let's have the final tonight! Start. Get up. Atid! Atid? Are you okay? If you're not okay, it's fine. Let's not fight. Let's just go home. Let's end it. Come on, Atid. Really? Are you serious? Get up then. Atid! Are you okay? If you're not, let's not fight. That's enough. Are you serious? Okay. Get up. Start! Start. Atid! Just kill me, Atid. Kill me. I am not a killer. Atid? Atid, look. That is the symbol of our belief. A-Wut, Chiwadong,... ...to me,... ...He is the Almighty,... ...the Greatest of all. I am sure. I believe that. Let's go, friends. Let's go home. Chiwadong's knee is so thick. I couldn't fight any more. It scared me, looking at it.
