Operator, get me the police. Hurry, please. This is it. Right down the hall there. Follow me. I can't imagine you are wanting to see Mr Richter. [ Buzzer ] A real gentleman. Never have trouble with him. [ Buzzer ] Just a minute. Yes? This is Charlie, Mr Richter. The policemen here want to talk to you. Sorry to disturb you Mr Richter. We've had a complaint against you. Against me? Are you sure? Yes. I am Lieutenant Mathews. This is Sergeant Vincent. How are you. - Can we come in? Well, by all means. Just exactly what am I supposed to have done? The lady across the road saw a man and woman in a struggle in this apartment. She thinks it was murder. Murder? - Murder? Holy gee. Are you quite sure you are in the right apartment? Yes. Yes, this it alright. Do you mind if we look around? No. Please do. Mr Richter wouldn't murder anybody. He is one of our best tenants. It's quite incredible. I hardly know what to say. - Don't let it bother you. People get funny ideas sometimes. We have to check as a matter of routine. Yes. I suppose so. A writer, huh? Well, that is one crime of which I am guilty. What's it about? Some historical probabilities. A collection of lectures I delivered abroad. Have you .. Have you been in all night? Yes. No visitors? - None. Have you had the lights on within the last hour or so? No. Oh yes, I did wake up about half an hour ago. I switched on the light to see what time it was. It was only on for a second or so. So I see what you mean. She might have seen my light and thought she saw more. Likely. Oh. Too bad. - A pity. Well, I suppose I'm unnerved. I am .. I'm not used to being accused of murder. No corpses. Embarrassing for me if there had been. Well, I'm glad there weren't. Murder gets so complicated. Nothing but red tape with us in the middle. Yes. In that case I am even more delighted. Well, I guess that covers it. Sorry to have troubled you, Mr Richter. No trouble at all. Could I offer you a drink before you go? No thanks. We had better be off. Next time you kill somebody pull your shades down. I'll remember to do that. I'm sorry this happened, Mr Richter. Think nothing of it, Johnny. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Well? Nothing. Nothing what? There wasn't any murder. Not even a fight. - But I saw it. You mean you dreamt you saw it. - It was not a dream. I was wide awake. You'd been asleep, hadn't you? Isn't that so? I wasn't asleep when I saw it. I know the difference between dreaming a thing and seeing it. Sometimes you can. It happens. You'd had a nightmare and you thought you were awake but you weren't. So, you saw a murder that didn't take place. It's common to be fooled by a dream. - I don't believe it. It's pretty plain, lady. There was no murder. No body. No sign of a struggle. No nothing. He could have hidden the body. - We searched. Believe me, lady. There was no body. Do you think it's easy to hide a body? Yes, but .. It just doesn't seem possible. I remember waking up and looking across and .. Of course you do. But you actually didn't. Isn't that right? Right. I don't know. We'll just report you didn't see anything. You just thought you did. Not feeling well. Had a bad dream. How is that? Okay? I feel like such a fool. You needn't. It happens all the time. Any other address we can get you just in case? I work at Sloane's, Beverley Hills. I am interior decorator there. Are you under a doctor's care? Of course not. Why do you ask? - Routine. I am not a mental case, if you please. Who said you were? Okay. That's that. Go on back to bed. I'm sorry I set you off on such a wild goose chase. You needn't be. It's all in a night's work. Sure. No hard feelings, lady. Only. Please be a little more careful of what you dream next time. I will try. Did you paint those? - I'm afraid so. Not bad. They are both lovely. It's very difficult to decide. No, I really don't know. But blue like you say is awfully smart. But the beige matches my sofa. Don't you really think beige is more my type? Well, really. Madam seemed put out about something. What happened? My heart wasn't in her drapery problem. Your heart doesn't look like it's in anything this morning. What's the matter? Off your feet? No. Just didn't sleep well. That's all. Oh golly. I am late. I'm supposed to be out at somebody's ranch house in Van Nuys. You will never make it. How about your lunch? - I'll drugstore it on the way home. What would you do if you thought somebody might decide to kill you? Call the police. Who do you have in mind? Madam? She didn't look that mad. They would never believe you. Who wouldn't? - Anybody. Kinda quiet today. Things on your mind? - Sort of. Don't let them get you down. Always remember. It could be worse tomorrow. That's what I'm afraid of. Yes? You have an apartment for rent? - Yes. May I see it please? - Certainly. Right this way please. Haven't I seen you before, Miss? You look kind-of familiar. - Well, it's possible. I live around the neighborhood. I'm thinking of making a change. I see. Go right in. It makes a nice place when it's all painted up clean. It's so hard to tell about empty place. I know what you mean. If I could see one like it that has been furnished .. I'll show you the one next door if you like. The tenant isn't in. The same kind of layout. Would it be too much trouble? - No trouble at all. Right this way please, Miss. Oh yes. This is very nice. Of course, Mr Richter is a bachelor. A woman would fix a place up differently. We don't have much turnover here. Tenants just stay on and on. The apartment you just looked at was occupied by a lady for over nine years. Went east to live with her sister. Mr Richter has been here three years. A nice decent fellow. Well, I've seen enough. - Yes, ma'am. Of course, you'll get a much better idea when you see the place all fixed up. You can't get a better buy at the price. A first class building and all that. I'll think it over. - Yes, ma'am. Come in. Nice to see you again. Have a seat. These are the ones alright. What do you mean? Richter just phoned. He said a pair of earrings were stolen from his apartment. I didn't steal them. I took them to show to the police. You broke into somebody's home and took something that didn't belong to you. The name for that is theft. I only did something which the police should have done in the first place. If they weren't so cocksure of themselves. In detective fiction Miss Draper .. It is the custom for people to go barging in to other people's houses .. Hiding in closets to look for clues and taking things that don't belong to them. In real life you get arrested for doing things like that. It is my duty in fact to charge you with theft. But he is a murderer. My life is in danger. Don't you understand? Look, don't let's get excited. You say he is a murderer. Murdered whom? I don't know. That woman. The owner of the earring. The owner of these earrings was Mr Richter's wife. She died in Germany in 1943. How do you know? We checked. They were on the customs list when they entered the country in '49. Well, that still doesn't explain the torn curtain. I couldn't dream something that really happened. What torn curtain? The one she grabbed when he struggled with her. It's still there. You can go and see for yourself. That curtain was torn last night in my presence. Mr Richter tore it himself trying to close it. But he couldn't have. I saw it. I saw it when it happened. I don't care what Richter did. Maybe he tore it again deliberately to throw you off. That's possible of course, providing he's the murderer. But how can we assume that? On what basis? Simply because you say he is? Be reasonable. We can't accuse a man of murder without proof. Without some evidence we have no right even to suspect him. Isn't that so? [ Door knocks ] Come in. Oh. Miss Draper. I didn't expect to find you here. Are these the ones? Yes. But how marvelous of you to get them back so soon. They are a family heirloom. I should hate to lose them. Had you anything to do with their return? I took them. Miss Draper has been playing detective. She still thinks a crime happened last night in your apartment. This is ridiculous. What were those earrings doing on your desk? I was to send them to a jeweller for cleaning. I was to make a gift of them. What about the dust marks on the floor of the apartment next to yours? Where you dragged the body and hid it. And the trunk today with the body in it. Outrageous. Now take it easy, both of you. - Yes. I am sorry. Losing tempers isn't helping. - Of course not. I'll try to be patient with Miss Draper. I believe she acts under a compulsion for which she isn't responsible. I don't know of any dust marks as I've not been in the apartment she speaks of. As for the trunk. It's full of books. You can check for yourself. It's up at my country place. Satisfied? May I go now? Unless Mr Richter wants to press charges. No. I wouldn't dream of it. I don't think that either one of us would like to see Miss Draper in jail. She is much too attractive. You are very kind, Mr Richter. But you and I both know I would be much safer in jail, don't we? Ah, what a pity. Looking at her, it is hard to believe. Believe what? It is obvious she isn't well. Do you think so? She seems normal. Oh, by the way. Where is that country place of yours in case we want to get in touch with you? I occupy what was formerly the gatekeeper's cottage .. On the Overhill estate in Pasadena. Mrs Overhill is a very dear friend of mine. In fact it is to her that I .. I am giving the earrings. I see. Alright. Much obliged. - Well .. Goodbye, Lieutenant. You have been most cooperative. Don't mention it. Eddie. Get me a run-down on this fellow Richter. I know, but get it anyway. [ Buzzer ] Good evening. May I come in? Please do. I took a chance on you being here. I go by this way anyway. I wanted to talk to you. - Oh? Did you read Richter before or after? I got it on the way home. If it isn't against the law to say so, our pal Richter has some peculiar ideas. Listen to this. 'Violence is in the nature of progress'. 'It is the wellspring of growth'. 'The stars were in conflict to create the earth'. 'Matter struggled with matter to make life'. 'Man is born in pain to give pain or die'. 'Only the unworthy seek the martyrdom of submission'. 'They fall aside under the trampling feet of the future, unfit to live'. 'Let them die. Death to them is kindness'. What kind of talk is that? A hash of Nietzsche and Hegel I would say. Richter is an ex-Nazi. Not very 'ex' judging from this. Fortunately, you are the only one who buys his books. The sales I am told are very low. Well, you have been doing some checking. You rise in my estimation. What else did you find out him? The book jacket only says he is a: 'A historian of note and has lectured in many European universities'. Well, he was a minor bigwig in Hitler's culture system. His wife was killed in an air-raid. He saw the end coming and escaped to Switzerland. He returned to Germany after the war and got himself de-Nazified in court. He came to the US and took out his first papers. Rumor has it he will marry Mrs Overhill. The wife of the late financier. Well. You thought we didn't know our business, didn't you. Thorough, to say the least. Heaven only knows what you have dug up on me. You .. You have been digging I take it? A California girl. UCLA. Studied architecture. Went to New York. Studied at the art Students League. Tried interior decorating on her own. Didn't make a go of it. Came back to the job at Sloane's. Well thought of there. You make it sound so dull. Well, facts are always dull. It's what is in between that tells the true story. Like being engaged to a guy who never got back from his last bomber mission. Things like that. Oh, Sorry. I didn't know it still hurt. What did you come here for? I'm worried about you. And not just officially. I don't like the desperate way you are running after this thing. Turning fantasy into reality. It's unhealthy. You are too nice a girl. You still think I dreamt it? Positive. - How can you be sure? I've been checking. There isn't an iota of proof a crime was committed except in your imagination. Either that or Richter is a cleverer murderer than you are a detective. Are you always as stubborn as this? - Only when I see a murder. You don't expect me to deny something I actually saw with my own eyes? And I did see him kill her. Eyewitnesses have been known to be wrong. They a have sworn many an innocent man into jail. Honest eyewitnesses, like you. I am not convinced. The other night you were ready to admit you were mistaken. You did in fact. Didn't that prove you might still be? - No. It only proves how forceful you are. You frightened me. That's all. Look, let it go. You did your duty. You thought you saw a crime and reported it. You behaved like an upright citizen. Now forget about it. - I can forget about it but can he? You have read his book. He thinks killing is alright. It's pretty obvious I am next in line. Providing he has murdered somebody in the first place. Providing he hasn't, you are the menace. Not him. So far he hasn't. Did you ever take a real good look at his eyes? We don't book people for murder because of the way they look. If we did, half the folk in Los Angeles would be on their way to a gas chamber. Well, the smile and the eyes don't go together. They look at you but they don't see you. They are .. Calculating like a .. Well, like a hungry animal and .. Oh. Oh. Oh. Now see what you have made me do. It couldn't have been any good. It was good last night and the night before. It would have been good tonight. I tell you what. File it under 'lost causes' and I'll take you out to dinner. I know a place they never heard of leftovers. Serve you right if I did stick you for dinner. Only I don't even know you. Except for the fact you tried to put me in jail this afternoon. What is to know? I am a Lieutenant Detective. Unattached. Another 6 months night school .. I'll be a full-fledged lawyer with a job in the D.A.'s office. Eventually, a kindly and elderly judge beloved by all. How does that sound? Not bad at all. Then what are we waiting for? Well, I was sort-of planning on staying at home tonight and doing some work. Look, stop being so difficult. Go and powder your nose. I'm getting hungry. Alright. What can I lose? Anyhow, it will be the first time I've ever had dinner with a police escort. Larry? Larry, have you seen the morning paper? Well, there is a story in it about a murder. They found the nude body of a woman in Griffith Park. Well, there must be a connection. Just keep everything under control. I will pick you up .. Rear entrance? Right. It's too far-fetched. That's all. Well, I don't see why. Isn't the Overhill estate up that way near Pasadena? He could have hidden the body in the trunk. We checked the trunk. It's in the house. Full of books. Just like he said. No blood marks. No nothing. Just books. I still say she was in the trunk. Do you ever think you will find out who she was? There is nothing to go on yet. The body is still unidentified and likely to remain that way. That's why the murderer took all her clothes. Smart. - Yes, but .. There must be somebody who will miss her and manage to identify her, won't there? Maybe. Maybe not. It all depends on the kind of a girl she was. My guesses are not kind. Well, what about footprints and things? Aren't there scientific ways of tracing those things nowadays? There weren't any footprints. Too many tire tracks to be of any value. So she was pushed out of an automobile. - Pushed out? Then it was Richter. He pushed her out of the station wagon. There you go again. How can you know? Because I feel it. A woman's intuition. A fine reason to pin a murder rap on somebody. Ten to one she was left there by whoever picked her up last and played too rough. It happens all the time. It is very unfair to connect her with Richter and totally without foundation. As a police officer I simply can't do it. Just the same, I still feel it. You feel it because you want to feel it. That obsession of yours must be proved no matter how illogical you have to be. Even if you have to pretend something happened which didn't. But it's not a pretence. I mean it. All fixations are a pretence. You begin by pretending and pretty soon you forget to pretend. Alright. I have told the truth saw I saw it. If people won't believe me .. I believe you told the truth as you saw it but the question is .. Did you see it? And the answer is I did not? That has to be the answer. Why? Because the facts say it is the answer. You mean you think I'm mentally ill. If you think it, why not say it? I don't mean any such thing. Now stop putting words in my mouth. I mean .. you could be if you .. Don't very soon face up to the truth. Oh Larry, what shall I do? Just try to lick this thing. That's all. Lick it before it licks you. But I have tried. I try to tell myself this thing did not happen but I just go around in circles. Start trying as hard to prove it isn't the truth as you tried to prove it is. Change your attack. Once you do that everything will fall naturally into its proper perspective. Alright. There was no murder. It was a dream. Therefore there was no body in the trunk. So it couldn't have been the girl they found in Griffith Park. How was that? Now you are making progress. Fine. But I wish I could believe what I am saying. Goodbye. - Bye. Oh, Larry. How long has she been dead? Do they know? For a couple of days the coroner's report said. Two days? That would just be about right. About right? Look. I thought we had been all over this. I was just thinking. - Well, stop thinking. About that anyway. Think about me instead. I will call you tonight after school. Okay? Okay. Bye. - Goodbye. [ Buzzer ] What do you want? - Only a moment. I'd rather not .. I protest about this letter you sent me. - What are you talking about? This letter. It arrived in this morning's mail. I sent you no letter. - You did. Who else could have? 'I saw you kill her. I will keep on saying it no matter what you do to me'. 'You are a murderer'. You annoy me with this silly accusation and now you send me threatening letters. This is a trick. What do you think you are doing? You did commit murder. I saw you. I warn you, Miss Draper, that my patience is running low. Get out of here. I wish you no harm. In fact, I am sorry for you. But I must insist that there be an end to letters and accusations. This one, I shall destroy as if nothing had happened. But if there are any more of them. I will be forced to take drastic action. - Get out before I call the police. You may call them if you wish but I do not advise it. I suggest Miss Draper that you see a doctor. You are not well. Yeah? Oh. Hello there. No. He isn't here. No. This is his night at law school. Yep. UCLA. Thank you very much. I don't get it. - He could have written it himself. What for? To implicate me in some way. I don't know just how. But you said he destroyed it. - Then who could have written it? Some crank maybe. - But nobody knows about it. It isn't as if it were in the papers. Lots of people know about it. The elevator operator. The manager. Eddie knows about it. I know about it. Would you write it, Larry? Not consciously. You mean that .. It could have been written unconsciously? It's possible. You will be missing your classes. I'll drop by on my way home and we'll have some coffee and talk it over. No. It will be late. I have some thinking to do. I'll get in touch with Richter tomorrow. Maybe he can shed some light on it. Alright. He said I should see a doctor. Nonsense. Maybe I should. Well, keep trying. Hey, get a load of this. Our friend Richter has broken into print. 'Heiress to wed. Widower financier to remarry'. 'Mrs Lathrap D. Overhill, wife of the late international banker ..' 'To become bride of Albert Richter'. 'Noted historian and author'. How do you like that? Pretty soft, eh? No wonder I haven't been able to get a hold of him all morning. Sure. He's probably out spending those millions already. A wife like this I should have. [ Buzzer ] Sergeant Vincent. Alright. I will tell him. Captain Donnelly would like to see you in his office. Right away. Is something up? Haven't you heard? I'm taking over the department. How are you, Lieutenant.? Mr Richter. Take a chair, Larry. Congratulations. I've just been reading about your engagement. You are getting married? - Yes. He is engaged to marry Mrs Overhill. It is in today's paper. Well, you don't say? Good luck. Thank you. Larry. You've had your hand in this business so I sent for you. About this Cheryl draper. Oh? I hope you don't mind my going to your superior but .. Things will become very serious. What do you know about this girl besides this? There is nothing to know. She is a .. A fine intelligent human being. Talented and unusual. Normal? - Uhuh. What's this stuff about accusing Mr Richter here of murdering somebody? Mr Richter and I have been all over that. She experienced a particularly realistic dream. It is very hard to convince her that it didn't happen. If she finally is convinced though .. I don't think Mr Richter will have any more trouble from her. Then how do you account for these letters? Letters? You mean more than one? Two of them. Threatening letters. Received in the mail by Mr Richter. One right after the other. Isn't that right? - Yesterday and today. One in each mail delivery. May I see them? The crumpled one I was going to throw away and then I thought better of it. Was that the one you confronted her with yesterday? Yes. I hoped to put a stop to it with a personal visit. But then when the second one came I realised it was something serious. For her own good as well as anything something should be done about it. Don't you agree? It's so hard to believe that she would do anything like this. Mr Richter doesn't want it brought into open court if it can be avoided. We think an initial medical examination to establish her responsibility .. [ Buzzer ] Yes? Have her brought in. I had her picked up. I wanted to overlook the whole business. But there are other considerations. My fianc?e for one. If an attempt is made on my life as she threatens in her letters .. Or her silly accusations get into the newspapers .. With a name like Overhill publicly associated with mine. Well, you can just imagine how embarrassing it would be. Larry. - Cheryl. What's all this? I don't understand. - Now don't worry. It will be alright. Just a couple of things to straighten out. That's all. This is Captain Donnelly. And you know Mr Richter. Now, Miss Draper. If you can cooperate with us I think you will find it will be better all around. Better for you. Better for Mr Richter. Better for everybody. Why was I brought here like this? Am I under arrest? Not exactly. You see, we want to help you, Miss Draper. Help me? How? What have I done? Larry .. I .. - It will be alright. Don't worry. Now just relax and take a seat. We'll go over this piece by piece and see how matters stand. Try to be as objective as you can about this. It is just a formality. That's all. Could you let me handle this alone? I'm sure I could get to the bottom of it I can talk to Miss Draper privately. No reason why we can't do it right here. Just remember that nobody wants to harm you. On the other hand, we don't want you to harm anybody either. Like Mr Richter here. You have been falsely accusing him of committing a murder. We went all over that. I admitted I was mistaken. I apologise. I am sorry. These letters don't sound like you were sorry or mistaken, Miss Draper. What letters? You know what letters. The ones you've been writing to Mr Richter. You mean the one he said I wrote to him. Well, I don't ever remember writing that. Couldn't it have been someone else? - Well, what about the second one? You don't remember writing that one either? The .. second one? This one? But I didn't. I never wrote this. Larry .. - Cheryl. Is this your typewriter? I don't know. Look it over. Take your time. I guess so. It looks like it. It's yours alright. It was taken from your apartment less than an hour ago. You were in my apartment? These letters were written on your typewriter. Does anybody else occupy that apartment with you? No. Then they must have been written by you. Isn't that so? Come now. You did write them, didn't you? You might as well tell us the truth. No use in keeping up a pretence. But I didn't. I never wrote them. Larry, tell them I didn't. This is a trick. You know I never wrote those letters. You killed her and now you're trying to kill me. Larry, can't you see what he's doing? Please believe me. - Don't, Cheryl. Don't. Can't we postpone this until she feels better? No sense in postponing it. It's very obvious this girl needs medical help. I propose to send her to the city hospital at once for observation. Oh no. - It's for your own good. People who do the things that you do aren't healthy. They must be protected. I wish you wouldn't, sir. - But I'm not insane. I'm not! Please don't do this to me. Don't. You're making a terrible mistake, Captain. That is my responsibility. Well, I won't go. I won't go! Don't worry. I'll get a lawyer. You are all against me. You are all trying to do something terrible to me. And I won't let you! But I left him .. I didn't know how much. I had to lose. Better a no-good man .. If he's the man you love. Show Mr Peabody into the library please. Show Mr Peabody into the library please. While he kissed me. She has come around. About time. They must have loaded her good. I wouldn't mind a jolt like that myself. Feeling a little peculiar? That is the drug. It will wear off. - How did I get here? It will come back to you. You are in the hospital. One thing is certain. You ain't spending the weekend at the Vanderbilt's. Now, May. Mind your own business. - Tell her the truth. You are in the observation ward, sugar. Be careful what you say. She writes everything down and they hold it against you. Behave yourself, May. You'll feel better when you've talked with the doctor in the morning. But there is nothing wrong with me. I'll get you some coffee. That'll make you feel better. Bring me a cup while you're at it. You've had yours. Don't be greedy. Don't say anything. Especially to the Doc. Just agree with him. Otherwise you'll be in the loony bin before you know it. What are you, a suicide? No. I am nothing. I didn't do anything. It is a mistake. A terrible mistake. The same with me. They tried to tell me I took my clothes off in the street. The silliest thing I ever heard of. That's a racket. They got to get people in here. Otherwise they ain't got no jobs, see. Show Mr Peabody into the library please. Shut up. Nutty as a fruitcake. They ought not to allow her in the room with us. She might be dangerous. Will you can that singing. Don't you know any other tune? No wonder you tried to kill yourself listening to that drivel all day long. It happens I like this song. Show Mr Peabody into the library please. Shut up. Show Mr Peabody into the library please. That's all she ever says. It gets monotonous. I had a man. I bet you never had a man. I've had more men after me than you can count. That's my trouble. Men. They're always after me. There's something about me. I don't know what. Don't tell that battle-axe nurse. The Doc is in love with me too. That's why he keeps me here. I'll bet. Who asked you? Mind your own business and cut out that singing. It's getting on my nerves. I had a man. Cut it out I said. I didn't know how much. Alright. You asked for it. I'll show you. I'll break your neck. You're talking about me and my singing. Stop it. Stop it, I say. The minute my back was turned .. Now you get back into bed and stay there. I have to get out of here. - Now look what you've done. Here, calm down. You are going to be okay. Nobody is going to hurt you. - Please let me out of here. Please. I can't stand it any longer. I'm Cheryl Draper. - Sit down. Do you get hysterical often? No I don't. - How often? Not ever. Except yesterday afternoon. I was upset. That's all. When you were a child, did you used to cry when you wanted things? I suppose so. Most children do, don't they. How long have you been painting? Ever since I can remember. What do you feel before you start a painting? As if I were going to paint a masterpiece. And afterwards? As if I hadn't. There's a painting on the wall of your apartment. A sword which appears to be pointed at the viewer. Surrounded by a perfect circle of squares and rectangles disintegrating. And with the predominant color being red. What does that mean to you? It has no meaning. It has feeling. I don't paint symbols or things. I paint emotions. At least I try to. I don't often succeed. What emotion then does it represent? None that you can describe. Can you describe an emotion? It is what you yourself bring to it. A hundred people can see the same sunset but each will be moved differently. When was the first time you saw Mr Richter? The night when .. When it seemed to me he was in the act of committing murder. You had never observed him previously? No. - Are you sure? Positive. Is it possible you saw him but do not remember? It is possible but I don't think so. Have you ever dreamt of Mr Richter? No. Was it Richter you referred to when you told your associate at Sloane's .. That someone might be attempting to kill you? Did I tell her that? I suppose I did. Yes. It was Richter. Do you often translate dream images into reality? No, I don't. You've never believed in fantasy? - No. Are you afraid of the dark? Sometimes. - Why? I don't know. You wake up and you're frightened. No reason. You think there could be someone in the shadows? A man who might attack you? It's possible but I don't think so. - This man might be Richter? Possibly. Do you think he is persecuting you? I .. I thought he wanted me out of the way because I was the only witness to .. To what he had done. You still insist that he committed murder? No. Not now. But you did? Why have you changed your mind? Well, facts indicate that he did not. I must have been mistaken. And the letters? I must have written them. You denied that you had. I don't ever remember having written them. But you remember now? Well, who else could it have been? They were written on my typewriter. But you don't actually remember writing them? No. [ Buzzer ] Yes? She is here. I'll tell her. That's all. You may go. When you leave here, go to the executive office straight down the hall. Thank you. Doctor. Am I alright? We'll see. Larry. Steady now. You're on your way home. I've got a writ for your release. It was ghastly. - I know. Just a minute now and it will be all over. Sign here please. Am I really out of my mind, Larry? Of course not. Well, there must be something wrong or I wouldn't have written those letters. I did write them, didn't I? The evidence does point to it, Cheryl. It's horrible. Nothing horrible about it. Just an illness. That is all. You are a very sensitive person. You had some kind of shock and it made you sick. So you can go to a doctor and get cured just like any other kind of a sickness. It's not like any other kind of a sickness. Nonsense. You should see them, Larry. The ones I was living with for the past two days. How did such a thing begin? I've always felt that I was .. Cheryl, stop thinking about it. What are we going to do? I'm so confused. What if I told you I still believe I saw that murder? And that I didn't write those letters. It's as if I were two different people. Both strangers to each other. Cheryl, please. We'll straighten it out I promise you. Just be patient. Don't come up. Are you sure you will be alright? - Yes. I will be alright. Larry, we mustn't see each other anymore. Look, let me be the judge of that, will you? No, Larry. No. How about something gooey for dessert? No thanks, Tommy. Not tonight. Just coffee. What's the matter with you? You hardly touched your food. I'm not very hungry, I guess. Never mind, Tommy. Just the check. Not even coffee? - No, nothing. Larry. Larry, listen to this. I just saw Richter buying up copies of all the newspapers. And I did the same. All of them have a story identifying the girl they found in Griffith Park. Well, I know it's remote but it is a possibility, isn't it? Why else would he buy the papers? And listen. I think I know how those letters were written. He came in here, left my door off the latch and wrote the .. No. No proof. Never mind. Never mind. Cheryl. Cheryl. Eddie. Send in copies of all the evening papers, will you. Right. Thanks. [ Buzzer ] Just a minute. Come in. I was expecting you. Expecting me? Yes. When I saw you buy those newspapers I knew you'd call on me sooner or later. Won't you sit down? Then you know what I found out in them? - Naturally. She was the one? She was. You admit it? To you? Yes. Why not? If you plan on killing me .. Sit down Miss Draper and stop being so melodramatic. Of course I admit it. I have nothing to fear from you. You are insane. It is recorded in the police files and in hospital reports. Anything that you might foolishly say concerning my admission .. Would merely corroborate their findings. You have an id?e fixe about me. Possibly dangerous. They'd put you in an asylum most likely. I see. - Of course you do. You are so intelligent. It's a matter of some regret to me .. That you had the bad luck to witness the demise of my late friend, Miss Stewart. A great pity. You and I in other circumstances might have been so interesting to one another. You paint quite well. Not a school I admire, but quite well. And as you also read my books, we could have enjoyed a pleasant relationship. They will catch you eventually. - I don't think so. But I do admit that when they identified the body it gave me quite a turn. I had no idea that Joyce had ever been arrested. A thoroughly wretched girl. Still, there isn't a scrap of evidence to connect me with her. But you just can't .. Who do you think you are? No matter what she was. You had no right to kill her. She had less right to live. Who was she? A creature with whom I amused myself. Just think of it. This insignificant nobody put in jeopardy my life's work. Put in jeopardy the future of the world. For I alone, my dear lady. Have the key for which history awaits. The gospel which may well be the religion of centuries to come. With the fortune I am to marry. And with Miss Stewart eliminated. We move forward. We move forward on the bones of ranting house painters .. And Italian clowns and Georgian peasants in to the future. [ German language ] [ German language ] Yes. The way is clear now. All except for you, my dear. But then you are sort-of stalemated, aren't you? If I were you, Miss Draper, I would give up. From every standpoint, my dear lady. You would do much better to join Miss Stewart. Yes. You look at me with loathing and hate. And that is just the way I want you to look at me. For in hate there is love. True love. A love that gives pain and extinguishes life. You are mad! Larry. Larry, he's confessed. He told me he killed her. Larry, he is insane. - Now take it easy. You don't believe me? - He just phoned to say you were there. But the newspapers. He was reading all about that girl. He said he was reading all about his engagement. That's in the papers too. Larry, you have got to believe me. I want to believe you. Don't you think I have wanted to all along? But what can I do? I've sat here and said to myself she's telling the truth. He is a murderer. Alright. Where do I go from here? If there were one tiny believable shred of evidence to go on but there isn't. There isn't anything. Not a thing. You say he struggled with a woman in his apartment. What woman? We haven't found one single corroboration of your story. And don't think I haven't tried. You say it was the woman they found in Griffith Park. On what grounds do you say a think like that? How can we prove it? Just give me one single thing to go on, Cheryl. Besides your guesses. One single thing. We are lost, Larry. I can't arrest a man without evidence. I've got to have something to go on. We are lost. [ Buzzer ] Cheryl. Yes? Speaking. Yes. I will be right there, Captain. He didn't believe you, did he? I told you he wouldn't. You might as well give up. There is really nothing to do now but to end it. You are too late. She drove off. She seemed very upset. You know, I came over here to talk to you about her. I am concerned for her safety. Earlier this evening I saw her standing by her apartment window looking down. I had the feeling she was going to jump. - Oh? When she saw me she apparently changed her mind. And that's when she came over to my apartment. Her story is different. More accusations? Poor girl. You know, it's none of my business but I think she should be hospitalised. In a sanatorium where they could look after her. In time, she could be cured. These things are not hopeless you know. We'll see. - If it's a question of money .. I should be glad if you'd call on me for some of it. A contribution at any rate. You know, I feel sort-of responsible in a way. I should like to be of assistance. That's good of you but it won't be necessary. Thanks anyway. Just a thought. It's there should you want it. Goodnight. - Night. See if you can get a policewoman to look in on Miss Draper tonight. Strictly unofficial. A problem? Just in case. Are you worried about something? Beware of Greeks bearing gifts. What? 'Beware of Greeks bearing gifts'. It is a saying. Did you find out anything more on that Stewart girl? A cold trail. The guys who've been working on it are ready to call it quits. Now, if you ask me I think she was a pickup. Strictly for the dead file. One chance in a million. In two million. Two million what? Hey, what are you talking about? Let's take a ride out there. A ride out where? The ground where she lived. That Stewart dame. Have you got her address? Are you nuts or something? We're not even on the case. You are sticking our noses in somebody else's job. What's it with you anyway? Look, we are detectives, aren't we? So let's make like detectives. Television detectives. Pam-pa-dum-pum. 6:45. We go looking for trouble. 6:46. We find it. "You might as well give up." "There is really nothing to do now but end it." "Nothing to do but end it." "End it." "End it." "End it." "End it." "End it." "End it." "End it." "End it." "End it." [ Police siren ] You'd better take it easy around these curves, lady. There's a guy on duty up in the flat. He will let us in. You sure you want to get mixed up in this? Never mind the flat. Let's dig up the manager. Yes? - Police. 3C. There is a policeman there now. He can let you in alright. First, I want to ask you a couple of questions. More questions? I know nothing. I tell policemen I don't know nothing. She's a pretty girl. Pretty girl giving trouble all the time. No husband. No good. Did you ever see this man in or around the house? No. Never seen this man. Thanks just the same. Now, I'm beginning to get the drift but how do you fit him into this? Three million. Them odds are sure jumping. Yeah. This is it. Well, we'll try this one first. Yeah? What do you want? I'm cooking dinner. Again? I told them everything I know. So shoot me. I don't know nothing else. - Who are they, reporters? All I want to know is, did you ever see this man? Not me. No. That's not the murderer. If you ask me it was gangsters. Took her for a ride. So who asked you? - Why don't you shut up? All you do is butt in. Talk, talk, talk. Private. Hello. Is your mother home? We are the police. Mom. It's the police again. Did you .. did you ever see this man? Uhuh. Yes? I'm sorry to disturb you. Just tell me if you ever saw this man in or around the house. I never saw him. I don't know why you bother. It's good riddance, I say. Thank you. Four million. I'll say it for you this time. One in ten million. It was worth a try. Let's take a look around her apartment while we're here. Whose apartment? - The Stewart girl. What do you expect to find? They went over it with the works. What can we lose? Waking up some cop out of a sound sleep. He'll be glad to see us. Maybe he is lonely. Come on in. I didn't think anybody would be around anymore tonight. The lab boys did a job on the place this afternoon. I just want to take a look around. You think she could have done it? I'd sure like to get out of this trap. Nothing to do but listen to the radio. And drink beer. It's the kind of job a fellow works up a thirst on. You want a can? Got some in the kitchen. No. You'd better hang on to it, pal. It may be a long night. That's that I guess. The walls aren't going to talk. Them odds are going up again. And it looks like it. Well. The lady certainly went in for hot literature. I'll bet it ain't the only thing she went in for. Well, we might as well beat it. Now, that's the smartest thing you said all night. Well, what do you know? What's that? Who would have thought Miss Stewart went in for books by Albert Richter? Where's the phone? - In the bedroom. Come on, son. Those odds just dropped to evens. I have waited for you. - What do you want? I have something here I want to read to you. 'To whom it may concern'. 'I am desperately ill and feel there is no reason to go on any longer'. 'May God forgive me for what I am doing'. 'It is better this way'. You wrote that. On your typewriter. The last letter you wrote before committing suicide. You leapt out of the window to your death. I tried to prevent you but failed. No. No. [ Buzzer ] He's trying to kill me. - What's going on here? Who are you? A policewoman. Lieutenant Mathews sent me. She is trying to commit suicide. See for yourself. No, no. That's part of his plan. He's trying to kill me. Behave yourself. Help me. Help me. He is trying to kill me. Hold on to her. She is insane. Save me. Save me. - What's going on? Use the elevator. Somebody go up in the elevator and cut her off. The elevator ain't running. - Hey, we got to pull back. Wait a second now. What's going on? Some crazy dame is trying to kill herself. Cheryl. You brute. Cheryl. Are you alright, boss? ..t-g..
