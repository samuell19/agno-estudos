One. Two. Three. Welcome to your Bachelor's Party. Where's the party? It's your last night as a bachelor. Sit. Have a drink, listen to some good music. Relax. Don't sound so depressing. Tonight is all I have. I've promised them so much more. Think like a guy who's my age, not yours. You didn't take me to Vegas, that's okay. But the least you could have done was arrange some strippers. How old are you? 32. It's been 35 years since I turned young. I've never had to pay for chance encounters and romantic evenings. I never pay for sex. A night that's earned has something special about its morning. That's a nice pickup line. But seriously, where are the strippers? What's your wife going to say? She is not my wife yet. And she knows. It's my Bachelor's Party. You're so naive. Almost dumb.. He's so naive. I knew it. I knew it, bro. Who's the groom? I should have known! And I knew it and I was right. Look at what you are doing! Aren't you disgusted with yourself? Like, really. How are you standing here? I can't stand you right now! You pig! You.. You.. Which guy would say no to a stripper on his Bachelor's Party? Baby.. - I hate you. You ruined my life. Ruined what? It's not like I had sex with her. I can't believe I was going to get married to a shit face.. Guys, listen. Don't fight. Great advice. You have better advice? Are they breaking up because of me? They aren't breaking up because of me either. She wanted to test him. She asked me to do it and I did. But one should be smart enough to know where to stop. Even I threw a Bachelor's Party. He asked me to get strippers. But did I? Because you know your friend too well. Which guy would say no to a stripper on his Bachelor's Party? What do you expect him to say? 'Sorry, ma'am, but I am getting married tomorrow.' Should we just cancel the wedding then? Listen to me. He is innocent. Babe, I saw what he was trying to.. - It's not what it looked like. He was not into it. Guys often succumb to peer pressure wondering what their friends will say. He was just pretending. But he went for it.. - Trust me. I was sitting on his lap. I can tell. I couldn't feel a thing. Really? It had only been 15 seconds, and.. Guys often succumb to peer pressure. He had to act happy. He was not into it. Trust me. Trust me, baby. Great time.. - I am getting married. Thank you. - Bye. I am getting married. Bye. - Bye. Good night. Hi! Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Good morning. - Morning. Wild night? - Coffee? Thanks. I don't remember exactly, but I think I had fun last night. I mean, I'm sure we must have had fun. No one's ever complained. I just want to clarify that you shouldn't have any expectations. I mean last night was nice but don't think we have a future. And don't get me wrong. It's not like I didn't enjoy. But it's just that I am not looking at a relationship right now. I just want to make it clear in case you have any expectations that this can turn into something. And trust me, it's got nothing to do with you not being so young. I know this must be sounding weird and you must be wondering how a girl can say all this after waking up in a stranger's bedroom. I guess your bedroom got lucky. My guest room got lucky. You were saying? You mean nothing happened between us? Why? I mean, you don't get lucky with a hot girl like me everyday. Plus you're not that old that you can't do anything. So you could do me and you didn't. There must have been a reason. I don't sleep with drunk women. I don't give them the excuse of not being in their senses. Whosoever they are, they should know what they are doing. You lost your chance. You're not going to get me while I'm in my senses. "Prancing around without a care." "Drinking the night away." "Prancing around without a care." "Drinking the night away." "When my heart insists" "I just grab a peg." "Makes me blush till I turn red." "Guys say I am intoxicating." "I am intoxicating." "Guys say I am intoxicating." "I am intoxicating." "Guys say I am intoxicating." "I am intoxicating." "Guys say I am intoxicating." "I am intoxicating." "Your feet sway and your eyes look the other way." "Because you drink up a storm." "Your feet sway and your eyes look the other way." "because you drink up a storm." "Leaving empty bottles in your wake." "Leaving empty bottles in your wake." "When you're high, you can't stop grooving to the beat." "When you're high, you can't stop grooving to the beat." "All I need is the local specialty" "then I am going to dance till the end." "All I need is the local specialty" "then I am going to dance till the end." "Guys keep shouting, and I just pout." "I want to just lose control." "Guys say I am intoxicating." "I am intoxicating." "Guys say I am intoxicating." "I am intoxicating." "Guys say I am intoxicating." "I am intoxicating." "Guys say I am intoxicating." "I am intoxicating." "Leaving empty bottles in your wake." "When you're high, you can't stop grooving to the beat." "Leaving empty bottles in your wake." "When you're high, you can't stop grooving to the beat." Trying to drown your sorrows? Regretting that you lost your chance. I know I am hot. Aren't they looking happy? God bless those two. You almost got their wedding cancelled. Me? I am the reason they got married. They were almost on the verge of calling it off. I don't get it. If there is a need to test it then how can it be love? I have a question. Is sleeping together once enough to fall in love? Then how can it be enough to fall out of it? True. What a great thought. Well, it's hard to answer that question, but often one falls in love when you don't sleep together. You are hitting on me. As I said you don't have a chance with me while I am in my senses. Are you ever in your senses? Do you have a problem with my drinking? I like alcohol. You look married and your actions clearly indicate you're divorced. How old are you? I just turned 25 a couple of days ago. You see according to the constitution of dating age minus 7 into 2 is the maximum allowed. What? I am 26. So 26 minus 7 into 2 is.. 38. 38 is the maximum allowed. Then you have no chance. I am much older than that. That will be a little weird. By the way, you've got the formula all wrong. It's into 2 minus 7. 26 into 2 minus 7. 45. Are you under 45? - No. Don't pine too much for me. I'll call if I'm in the mood. Seems weird now that you think about it. But doesn't feel that way. 24 years' age gap is a little too much. But doesn't feel that way to me. That's called a generation gap, not an age-gap. Rich old man, hot young girl. Hot young girl with daddy issues. Spare me the psychological knowledge. What daddy issues? How would I know? I'll have to do a session with her for that. Give her my card. And tell her I only meet by appointment. Are you out of your mind? You think I'll refer you to a girl I've only met twice. And you're intellectualizing this for no reason. It's pretty simple. A guy and a girl met. They flirted. And they liked it. Let me put that right. A rich old guy and a hot young girl met. She saw the money, the old guy saw the youth. And now they are both trying to achieve what they don't have. Elementary, my dear Ashish. You're a very negative person. But my degree is real. It's not been photo-shopped and printed on a good quality paper for me to frame it. Who is the doctor here? Me. I handle hundreds of cases like this. Oh, please! Every week you show up asking me to lend you money. Nobody comes to get counselled by you. You do, don't you? Imagine how low you can get. And what are you trying to assert here? I'll pay you back every last penny I owe with interest. You're going to need it when she robs you of everything you have. You are a misogynist. Of course. Because no girl has ever flirted with a guy for his money. Misogynist. If I am a misogynist, then you are a dog. You think it's love. It's just lust. Plain lust! Who knows your feelings better, you or me? I am the doctor. If you're a doctor, then I.. I.. What? Imagining you as a doctor is so difficult I can't find an example for it. Your time is up. Get out. Your time is up. 58 minutes. Fine, sit. Pervert old man. You.. - Time up. Sir, we plan on bottling Arctic Air. In 2 to 10 litre bottles. And so, whenever you want to escape from the stressful pollution filled environment you're in you simply open a bottle of fresh air. It's so clever, isn't it? And you can have a vacation in your very own office. 'Hope you weren't getting restless.' It's genius, isn't it? 'You were getting restless to ask this. Weren't you?' We're going to call it.. A Breath of Fresh.. 'Oh, please.' 'It's okay. You can admit it.' 'Okay, don't act smart. Meet me at the bar at 12.' Thank you so much. I can't have two. Cheers, mate. Thank you, good night. Good night, Bob. Bye, love you. Such decent old guys those two. So cute. They come here every day and wait until the bar closes. I thought my age would be a problem. But you only find old guys cute. Do you own the place? No. I work here. I'm poor. Did you come all the way here from India to work in a bar? I came to study. College got over, and I started working. As a student, I used to bartend on weekends. Now I have a job from Monday to Friday and this on weekends. And before you ask any more questions the job pays good money, but it's boring. And I do this because it's fun. I'm an Engineer by degree. There are two kinds of people in this world. Career oriented and job oriented. I am the job-oriented kind. But you look like the career type. Do tell me. Don't be shy. I am into investments. I invest in companies while they are still young and have a scope so I can reap the benefits later. And I thought my age will be a problem. You invest in things before they grow so you can take advantage later. Only if I see scope in it. Did you invite me over to do the dishes? To check the scope. You made me do the dishes, clean the place. Now let me drop you home too. I am not going home. Why? My roommate's boyfriend has come over. And he's very irritating. Go ahead and ask, don't be shy. What? You can stay over at my place. Even I'll get some dishes done. So, what's the biggest problem men have nearing their fifties? They can't score. Period. They bought into the lies of Pharma companies ever since mid-life crises hit, but they still can't score. Problem is they are trying to score with the younger ladies. Hello. Is the offer still on? If you promise I'll be safe with you. I will try my best. Send me your address and I'll pick you up. I almost bought your pitch. India. Punjabi. When did you get here? I just got here. I mean, when did you come to London? 2001. Illegal immigrant? Visa. Did you get citizenship? Great. What brings you here? I'm here to pick someone up. Me too. My girlfriend lives here. She is angry, but I will make it up to her. "You still make my heart skip a beat." "I miss you, baby, from head to feet." "I admit I was a cheat." And I'll add a nice line after this. Nice? I know. Who are you waiting for? Your girlfriend's roommate. Ayesha's roommate. Ayesha? Baby. You didn't tell me that your dad's visiting. I told you it's over. Just leave me alone. We're done. Okay, fine. But our fight wasn't that serious that you couldn't tell me dad is coming. And I even wrote a rap for you. "You still make my heart skip a beat." "I miss you, baby, from head to feet." "I admit I was a cheat." "I admit I was a cheat." "Swear on my mom, it will never repeat." Thank you, sir. He's not my dad. Then who is he? Why should I tell you? Where are you going, Ayesha? Who is this guy? Your uncle, older brother.. Tell me something, Ayesha. I have a confession. I lied to you. That wasn't my roommate's boyfriend, he was my boyfriend that guy you just met. He cheated on me within a month of dating. It's 10 minutes late for it to qualify as a confession. But okay. "You make my.." "You make my heart.." "You make my heart skip.." Really? You okay? Yes, just irritated. Ayesha. Ayesha. Please hear me out. - What the hell are you doing here? Do you have no shame? Get lost and don't show me your face again. I really love you. Let's just give us one more chance. Please. Even if you are the last guy on earth, you won't have a chance. Do you understand? Now go to hell. At least hear me out. Ayesha, please hear me out. Please, just this once. Open the door, Ayesha. Ayesha, please. Ayesha, please. Please listen to me. Ayesha, please. Ayesha, what are you doing? Ayesha, please listen to me. Ayesha.. Hello. She is all I have, Uncle.. Ashish. Uncle Ashish, please talk to her. This is not the way. You tell me, is this the way to behave? Whatever happens, happens for the best. I had even booked a cottage for us on the outskirts of London where we would've lived after marriage. You may be able to see it from here also. There is nothing wrong with you. You can find more girls. And anyway, Ayesha is not fit for you. No, Uncle. She's the right one for me. Think about it. Everyone makes small mistakes. But that doesn't justify kissing a stranger just to make you jealous. Yes. Exactly, Uncle. Ashish. Uncle Ashish, what kind of behaviour is this? Who does something like this? Are you a stranger? If you are a stranger, then why is she staying with you, Ashish? Uncle.. Ashish. She is using me too just like she used you. And how exactly did Ayesha use me? What else will you call it? Till it suited her, she stayed with you, went out with you, kissed you. And when she got over you, she kissed someone else. If you don't value yourself, then others won't either. It's about your self-respect. You must prove to her that she is the one losing out. How? Come on. - Let's go. Stop calling her, stop pleading, stop crying! Be strong. Be very, very strong. Don't even look back. Then she will understand. You are right. That's the only way to get Ayesha back, Uncle. Ashish. I am glad you understand. Now you better leave before she comes out otherwise she will think that you're good-for-nothing. You're still here after she said all those things to you. Thank you, Uncle. Only you understand me.. Uncle.. 'At the gym, Alfred will get you.' All that effort for me? Don't put so much performance pressure on yourself. Elders say that one should pick a hobby befitting their age. What's the point of ending up with broken bones at such an old age? Don't insult yourself so much. And anyway, I changed my mind after seeing your choice. I cannot stoop that low. You are better off with him. Then why did you drive him away? If a poor, helpless woman seeks help, I cannot turn her down. I am old-fashioned that way. You're old in everything? You are really cheap. Show me your body. Show it. - Shut up. At least show me your chest. Are you mad? - Or your biceps. Come on. Don't be shy. What about abs? Do you have abs? Breakfast? Unfortunately, there are no potholes here. You won't get an excuse to hit the brakes. You're really cheap. What are you doing? How long have you been here? - It's been 16 years. Family? India. Kids? A son and a daughter. That's been my only regret. In order to live my life on my own terms, I left them behind. Feeling bad for your kids, not for your wife? It was a mutual decision between Manju and me. We were in college together. In the beginning, we both wanted the same life. But as the years went by, we both wanted different things. The kids had no say in this. You know, people say I am selfish. Maybe I am. I accept I am not a good father. But I feel if I had stayed back then I would've been worse. I wish I could live this life with Manju, Ishika, and Ishaan. But doesn't matter if I can't. You are a cool guy. I mean, very few 50-year-olds are so happy and so cool. Try as much as you want, the fact is you're struggling with yourself as to why you can't resist me. Constantly bringing up the age-discussion only to make yourself feel normal, that you.. And what? That you were with me last night and are with me again this morning. Shall we order? What? You get a text saying 'Come down to the bar'. When you get there, you find out that she is a waiter. Only as a hobby. Fair enough. She does it as a hobby. You spend two hours with her, cleaning the place doing the dishes, and let her rent your room for free all this for nothing in return. Are you blind? Can't you see that she's trying to take over your home? You're out of your mind and you're over-analyzing it. Who is the doctor? Me. Should I show you my degree? - Fine! Continue. People seek support from their children when they turn old not from wives that are their children's age. At a time when you should be walking your daughter down the aisle, you are.. What's the opposite of walking down the aisle? Whatever. You're doing just that. I am not the first guy in the world who's thinking of dating a girl half his age. There have been others. Were they all unsuccessful? Oh, really? Name one successful couple. Come on, tell me. Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. George Clooney and his wife. Saif and Kareena. I have nothing to say. I can't solve your stupid problems. Exactly. Exactly what I am talking about. Just shut up. I never said I have a problem. Every time I come over you make me sit in that chair and send me the bill. Now I know why you feel she is exploiting me. Because you exploit me, you feel everyone else exploits me too. Get out. Get out now. Be thankful that I see you without an appointment. I handle ten cases like this every day. And there will be a problem, I guarantee it. If you don't end up in that chair sobbing your heart out one day then I'll tear up my degree. That photo-shopped one. It's real. Smells nice. Indian? No, I've made pasta with a pinch of salt and a dash of pepper. Indian! I don't eat lentils. - Why? I just don't. - Who doesn't eat lentils? I don't. As you wish. What else will you eat? You eat, I'll check what else we have. I know you put in a lot of effort to make that. And it even looks tasty. But I can't find anything to eat. Let's go out. Really? Nothing at all? I am leaving the lentils only for your sake. Now I feel guilty. I'll have it with curd instead. No, no. I'll feel guilty if you don't eat. Let's go out. Have a pleasant evening. Is he going to leave us with cutlery for the next three days? One for the oysters, soup.. - Mr. Fancy. I know. We start with the ones on the outside and use the ones on the inside in the end. You are not the only sophisticated one here. I didn't know that when I came here for the first time. Illiterate. The price of a chicken entree is enough to open my own poultry farm. Ms. Sophisticated, I come here for business lunches. Calm down. - It's okay. Even the Indians out here are so English that they won't understand Hindi. You insisted on coming to this fancy place. I wanted some simple Indian food. I want to eat, not pretend to eat. What do you expect me to order from this? Lentil soup with minced vegetables, with a hint of mint. The menu is for English people. It's not my fault that they don't know what 'Dal' means. Your fault is that you thought you would take me to an upscale place I'll be impressed and think you're hot shit.. Shut up. Seriously shut up. Just tell me what you want to eat. Forget it. Looking at your level, if I take you where I go to eat you won't stop cribbing. Come on. They serve you 10 pieces of cutlery to justify their exorbitant prices. We just want to eat. It's not like they saute their food with gold or silver. It's a 150 years old restaurant. Seriously, everything in my life these days is antique. Can you tell me the time, buddy? It's 11. He's asking for the time and you're giving him your watch. We're being mugged. Wallet. Him? Even the bouncers at my club are double his size. Are they here now? - You are. What's the point of all that boxing you do? Will you just let them take what they want? I do it for fitness. I like your coat. You're simply giving him whatever he's asking for. Will you let him take me away too? You don't like me? "Singham." "The mind boggles, the body shivers" "when they learn of the arrival of.." "Singham." Can we go? What? A slap? Go on. I want to see him fly. Make him fly. He fell down here. And that guy is still moving. Do you want me to kill them? At least knock him out cold. Like a knockout in boxing. Hit him. He was going to touch me. Your wallet. This is for looking at my woman. I'm asking you to punch, but you're delivering a dialogue. Jacket. You're enjoying this, aren't you? Of course. I should have let them take you away. Imagine my plight if you hadn't been around today. How can I thank you for putting your life at stake to save me? This is for trying to be a hero. There is an age for everything. You picked a fight for such a small amount. Did I challenge them? I was giving them everything. But no. Who said, 'What's the point of all that boxing you do?' 'Will you let him take me away too?' They never even looked at you. You gave them that idea. You are so attention-hungry. Poor guys got beaten up for no reason. Poor guy. You walk around wearing an expensive watch and I am hungry for attention. Is it my fault that I am not poor like you? Was it my idea to walk? We could have just given them the money and left. That reminds me, where's my money? What money? The ones you took from them for looking at 'my woman'! Forget it. I beat them up, my fingers are swollen, so I earned it. You will skim off a woman? Yes, I will. Fine. You can keep it. And anyway, I am not your woman. Okay. Okay. Half-half? Good night. "I have witnessed your beauty in my dreams." "My heart feels you look familiar." "Every day I woke up with the image of your beautiful face in my eyes." "But I never knew that you were meant for me" "and now I feel.." "Even though we met late" "at least we did." "Slowly and gradually, we came.." "We came closer." "Even though we met late" "at least we did." "Slowly and gradually, we came.." "We came close." "I want to be with you every day" "using any excuse." "I'll begin to understand myself, once I understand you." "I want to see what you want me to see" "and hear what you want me to hear." "I don't need to breathe" "because you're my life now." "Even though we met late" "at least we did." "Slowly and gradually, we came.." "We came closer." "Even though we met late" "at least we did." "Slowly and gradually, we came.." "We came closer." I am sure you must be dealing with many cases like these ones with age difference. Hundreds of them. But they all come late. - What? I mean they should come six months earlier. But they all turn up after the divorce. I mean, it's quite amazing. Even in a highly educated place like London the concept of a prenup is unknown to most of them. It's not completely their fault, you know. The first lesson of every gold-digging session is about how to avoid the prenup discussion. You should call me to give a lecture one day. Don't listen to him. He's crazy. This is why no one ever invites him to their home. Really? - I'll get a refill. - For me too. Okay. Have you lost your mind? You should thank me. The prenup's going to come up sooner or later. This is not your clinic. Really? If a cardiologist visits a friend and his friend gets a heart attack the cardiologist won't save him but tell him to come to his clinic the next day. A doctor is always a doctor, whether he's in his clinic or not. Have your dinner and leave. Don't make an issue, I'll tear up my degree. Fine. Let's get serious and talk about the next step. Marriage. Kids. What have you thought? No. - What no? You haven't thought, or you're not looking to start a family? I didn't give it a thought. - Then do it now. I don't want to. What do you mean you don't want to? Thank you. The weather seems to be getting bad. Did you give it a thought? - Gave what a thought? Avoiding the question won't make it go away. Do you want to get married now? Do you want to have kids now? Not now, but at some point. And yes, at some point I want to have kids. Some point means marriage in two years and kids in four. Ashish, there's no point of discussing it with that attitude. Let it be. What can I say, Ayesha? I am 50. I've been a bad husband. I've been a bad father. I don't want to have kids and not be there for them again. In two years I'll turn 52 and in four years I'll turn 54. I don't want to be the father of a 10-year-old at the age of 65. By the time he's in college, I'll turn 70 or I might not even be around anymore. I can't.. I mean.. What are we doing then? I am living the day. And what about tomorrow? I don't know. There's a big difference between your tomorrow and mine. Your tomorrow is much more than mine. This won't work, will it? Everyone will always think I am with you for your money. And you're with me because I am hot and young. I am immature and you are boring. I want to explore new things but you've practically experienced all of them first hand. And you'll have to do everything all over again for my sake. You'll have to go back to the same places again. Make the same mistakes again. Have the same quarrels again. Cajole me again. Choose our song again. Think of a pet name again. Tell the same lies again. Endure the same taunts again. Laugh for the same joys again. Shed tears over the same sorrows again. You will be forced to relive your life all over again and I'll feel I am living an already lived, stale life. Aren't you going to say anything? What can I say? You have already made up your mind. That's the sensibility I don't want. I won't make fake promises of efforts I know I can't make. But I know that I love you. I know that life doesn't come to a standstill when someone leaves. It's just a matter of habit. You will get over it soon. And so will I. "I know we've parted ways, sweetheart" "but I still want you to know." "I know we've parted ways, sweetheart" "but I still want you to know." "If you ever miss me" "just come over." "If you think I'll ever forget you" "then you are wrong." "If you ever miss me" "just come over." "I had no one except for you." "You had become more important to me than breathing." "I may not mean anything to you" "but you meant everything to me." "Don't ever leave me" "is what you always used to say." "I have no more reasons to smile" "as even you moved on like time." "It had fallen for you, and still is" "my heat's crazy, you know." "If you ever miss me" "just come over." "I did as you said" "only I know how I consoled my heart." "Be happy, wherever you are." "There was never anything between us anyway." "Doesn't matter how far away we are from each other's eyes" "we will meet everyday in the world of dreams." "This is as far as we were meant to be." "Now you must return." "If you ever miss me" "just come over." Seriously? Her? This is all you could find after me? You think she can help you get over me. You have no standard, but think about my reputation. You can settle for anything? I can't believe that from this, you've gone to this. I can't get over you. You said I will get over you, but I can't. See, you don't know everything. You can't know everything. I am not asking for much. If nothing else, then make me a habit you can't give up. You are a total amateur. I was thinking I should introduce you to Manju and the kids. Why? I mean, how come suddenly? Just.. I never imagined something like this would ever happen in my life. But now that it has I would want them to know. I mean, if you are comfortable. When was the last time you met them? It's been a couple of years. Never had a chance to go and meet them recently. Do you need their blessings? That's not it. I was joking! Let's go. Not today. We'll leave next week. Okay. Don't worry. Nowadays it's not a big deal to meet the family. It's cool. I am not from 'nowadays'. 'I am not from 'nowadays'.' We need a better story. What story? Our story, which you will tell them. About how we met. Meaning? I mean, what are you going to say when they ask how we met? Look at the mountains. It's so pretty. See. She came home dressed as a stripper and then you found her unconscious in your home the next day. That story won't work here. That story won't work anywhere. Exactly. So then? I said we'll tell them the truth but I never said we'll tell them details. We met through common friends, simple. Too boring. Think of something else. Hey, look at the clouds. How are you, Pintu? - Fine. Get the luggage. I'll say we met at the temple while praying. That will make a good impression on them. Don't worry, I love you, you love me. No one's going to ask any more questions. Ishika. - Who called you? Ishika? - Who the hell called you here? My daughter. - Pintu. Keep the luggage back. Do it now. Who told you to get their luggage? If any random guy walks in here, will you get their luggage inside? Who called him here? It wasn't me. Who else could it be? You can't stop smiling. I wanted to call him, I even gave it a thought. But I swear on you, I didn't call him. Of all the days, did it have to be today? I didn't call him, Ishu. Munna, who called you here? Am I not welcome in my own home? And what does she mean by today out of all the days? You can come whenever you like. Just ask us first. I'll be right back. Your home? What is the colour of the walls of 'your' home? I don't care who called him here, tell him to go back. Where are your manners? What's the point now? Dad. Hi! - Ishaan! Hi, I am Ishaan. His son. And that's my mom. Did you call him here? Why did you? I told you it was her. Look at how she is welcoming him. Traitor. I didn't call him. Please tell him to go back, I don't want him here right now. Go inside. Don't make a scene in front of the staff. What's wrong with her? Her boyfriend and his father are coming over tomorrow to discuss the wedding. But.. Manju. - Ayesha. My wife. My secretary. Ishika is getting married and no one even bothered to tell me. She isn't getting married. Her boyfriend's coming over with his father to meet us. Even we are meeting them for the first time. And what was the point of having told you? Would you have come down from London to meet them? You couldn't respect any relationship while you were here and now you're saying you'd fly down from London to see the boy. Does he really think I need his approval to get married? This is not about my approval but I would definitely like to meet the guy. What will you say when they ask about the father? Were you planning on inviting me to the wedding, or.. I've already told them that my father is no more. Not even separated. Just dead. Not dead. We said he's no more. Meaning you're no longer her father. That's so absurd. Just because Manju and I are separated am I not her father anymore? Give.. Thank you. Very good. Make a scene in front of the outsiders so you can look like the victims. I will wait outside.
