- …5 miles south of the Red Sand Tower in shallow water, apparently in need of assistance. Over. - The recorders themselves are very robust. They can take a deceleration of 3,400G over six and a half milliseconds. - How do I know? - To put that into context... - Press and hold the button or the menu buttons to stop recording and save at same time. - Part One. One. - I love you inside out. I love your bones, and your blood, and your bile. And I love the shape of your organs. And the dark brown colour of your liver. And I love the sluice and spill of your liquids. But this is what reminds me of the recent thing I watched It's a dark web boxes that you just order from the web. You can give 200 pounds and you don't know what is inside. And inside, it might be one of the dreams that you've lost or one of the relatives that is just dead. I don't know. Many things you can find inside. It's that kind of box. - Right, that's six minutes then, nothing else for you now. Goodbye. - Keeps artefacts - I want you to try and tell me about this man. Is he always in black? Because he knew the box would be white, he just wanted to be the main character. That's why he became invisible. But I can't say why... why he's so stubborn. He's telling many things from inside and he shouts it. And he wants to tell things. But with his face, with his mouth, he thinks that he shouldn't tell any of this or he shouldn't mention this now. He might have some knowledge about this moment. But maybe you will hear later from him whoever who he is. And two hands are so different than each other, isn't it? I mean, is he struggling with the... I would say no. But maybe he's a bit ashamed. Like he has to do it some kind of thing. - Part Two. - I asked him, "Where the whalebone came from?" And he said, "It came from a washed up whale, possibly a blue whale." All sorts of ribs and vertebrae along with racks of baleen sacrificed after the whale had been smashed up as a result of a storm. And he then got the cord that binds round the box. He says that he took it from a herring net and he seems to remember that it had bits of lead attached that held it down under the water. And the challenge of the box comes from what's inside. The sculptor took the fishing weights and melted them in an old saucepan. So he made this lead container, filled with calm water, contained in the whalebone box. The whale actually is the box. - Philip Hoare. - Philip Hoare. Writer. - Whalebone is the heaviest bone because it is so full of oil. Do you imagine that it should be light and floating like the bones of a bird? But it's not. And so it's the kind of watery scaffolding for this huge creature. But I think the reason why we like whales and dolphins is they look a bit like us only zipped up in whale or dolphin wetsuits. I think a lot of it is to do with the fact that in pre-Darwinian, pre-modern times the barriers between us and other species were not so demarcated so that you could slip in between species. And there wasn't a lot of difference between you and your animals. And there was a lot more respect for animals for that reason. The first break in that came when man could kill, humans could kill remotely. - This whale is dying. It is carried by the people from the sea to the beach. It leaves the place that it belonged to. - The first image I remember was a woman in a forest with a gun. It might have been 2018. For me, these are images of happiness. - Easier said than done. No, hold it up there for a bit longer. - Were we filming then? What's wrong with you, man? - How long does it take? - What can you see? What can you see? - "Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see. At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives Homeward." - Do you think he's happy, happy here? - I would say so. - Wouldn't you? A pretty good spot. - A bit cold this time of year though. - Cold this time of year, but he can hear his beloved river in the background some of the time. - Are you sure that's not the motorway? - The motorway's the other side. I can think of getting him into the pub, which he was very fond of, but he had a belief in the Quaker thing of silence and only using words where it was essential. Trimming the fat off, getting to the musical essence. - Yeah. - It's very white on that side and it's very... The oils have come across to that side for some reason. Did you keep it upside down? - No, I kept it as it should be kept. As was instructed. - I'll go under this tree here to give you... - "Every birth a crime, every sentence life. No hope of going back. Every sentence life, every birth a crime. Brief words are hard to find." - Natural high... like in the mountains. High up. High up. Where are you, Mount Everest? - In order for an object to have a wavelength it must extend over some region of space, which means it occupies many positions at the same time. It's only when the box is opened that we see a single definite state until then it's essential. Half one thing and half the other. - Where are you? What can you see? - In this brief transit where the dreams cross, let the other you be shaken and reply. - Where is she? - Where the dreams cross... - Hello. - Mrs. Sinclair? - Part Three. - What's it doing up here? - It's a whale like hump, isn't it? Responding transcendently between the state of being on land and returning to the ocean. And the whiteness of the mountains recalling the albino whiteness of the white whale. And gouged and wounded and left with shreds of flowers. So it's a place of enormous potency and quiet and stillness. - And is the mermaid singing inside? - Not yet. No. - The mermaid is still in a way. It's waiting to be taken out onto the ocean to travel back to the island and the box is getting much, much heavier. Yesterday, in England climbing in the fells, it was light and it was borne on the wind. But today, it has the powerful weight of the extreme ocean, the depths and that voice that McGillivray enchanted into it is beginning to transform it into another substance. - There is no accident just as there is no beginning and no end. - You're not hot? - Can you see anything through the goggles? - What can you see? - You can't see the past? - Can you see lain? Can you see lain through the goggles? - You can't see the past? - Can you see the sea? - What can you see? - It knows what it is today. - Can you put the film back on? Can you put the film back on? Can you put the film back on, Andrew? - I found this piece of film. It was in the belly of a whale. And they pulled it out through the whale's mouth. - Its carvings... - Its carvings... - Convey... - Convey... - Messages. - Messages. - You can almost skew your arguments of this iconography to make it fit with the links that you want to make as you work around the casket. As well as the iconographies presented by the individual panels and the opportunities for multivalency are rampant. With this potential multivalency firmly in mind, multivalency being the ability to see the same thing in many ways, simultaneously… - The condition of the whale is reasonable. It is in pretty reasonable condition. You're through now. Go ahead. - Hello, mum, it's me. Have you had a lovely time? - Quite dense forest, sometimes heathland sort of blasted heathland, places you can still get lost and they were reborn and never to die again. What is she doing in the forest? Wearing clean clothes? So she doesn't walk too much. Maybe she came with the armchair itself? Because her clothes are very clean. Or she's invisible maybe like a... like an angel... like... A bit of a naughty angel, like maybe likes to shoot some... I don't know. Butterflies. The question is... is she happy now? Because she looks comfortable to me as if this is her own nature. - There are some of these still flying around on airplanes today. - He heard them a coming, he just... Isn't it cold? Isn't it cold? And he just... He heard them a coming he just, isn't it cold? - Nothing to authenticate the mission imposed. - Storms. - What's it doing up here? - Responding transcendently between the state of being on land and returning to the ocean. And the whiteness of the mountains recalling the albino whiteness of the white whale. We've found something in the ice. We need some help down here. Can anybody hear me? We've found something. We've found something. We've found something. - And that is the bit that is designed to survive the crash. - As you can see a very solid unit made out of very high impact resistant materials and that is the bit that is designed to survive the crash. - Down into dust and reeds at the patrolled bounds where captives thicken to gaze. Her eyes are looking down the... camera, isn't it, to the... So she's aware of... There is someone watching her. She's not alone. There is bit sadness though. - There is something sad and melancholy about trips. I always hate to go away. But one has to find some new place or it would be impossible to be sad and melancholy again. - What's in the box? What's in the box? - I'm going to open it. - When I said I admired you, I meant what I said. Curiosity killed the cat and it certainly would have you if you had followed your impulse to open it. - Exclusive devotion to melancholia leaves no room for interest in the outside world. - Part Two. - But why here? - Why are we here? - Well, we're here because this is the plug of the entire mythological system and I had to come here to disprove the mythology. I'd been haunted by a place I didn't know and coming to the real place you're overwhelmed by the geographical particulars the bite of the wind, the howling of the dogs in the woods, and the realisation of the paucity of my own imagination couldn't stand up to this. And all the time for so many years, right back to the beginnings of everything I've written, this Montségur has been at the heart of it. And how does a physical visitation manage to live up to that? - Anyway let's take her up to the top. - You mean just past where it says forbidden? Yes, wherever it says forbidden that's where we need to go. - Because the cantos of Ezra Pound, he visited here on a walking tour with TS Eliot. That the body of light come forth from the body of fire and that your eyes come to the surface from the deep wherein they were sunken that your eyes come forth from their caves and the stone eyes again look seaward. Guard this portal and the cellular Montségur. Wow. That's the iconic image of Montségur. - Wow. Get away from the edge. - Teach us to sit still even among these rocks. Slither companions. Pardon me, sir. What is it? - I don't know. - But whatever it is keep away. Don't let anybody near it. - Yes, sir. - Part Three. - Stop valve open, number four. - And as the needle of the syncrenoscope reaches the upright position another giant machine has sprung to life. - He just doesn't want synchronised sound. I mean, from what I've seen all he wants, is pure abstract image. He's just going to extract. This is the total bloody fascism of the director. He just doesn't want to hear anything that I have to say or anybody else has to say which is why every time he fucks it up. I mean, unconsciously, if nothing else. They're going to just make a film of pure images and then they'll just think, well, we'll add a few words here and there. Great music, I've got this great rap track. And they'll just put their own soundtrack on. And I mean, let's face it with a different soundtrack. It could be any 1 of 50 different movies. - Baby, baby, baby, where did our love go? - Was that too loud? Do you want me to turn it down a bit? - Yeah. - Baby, baby, baby, where did our love go? Don't you leave me this way. Don't you leave me this way. Baby, baby, baby, where did our gloves go? - Where did the whale go? - In her head. She's imagined the whale in her head. - Okay. She is dreaming about the box. But the box is a real thing. And I've also seen in the pictures that she was holding a gun to hunt a whale in her mind. But it's happening in the reality. And this one could be... This box made by paper could be the whale box in her dream. But not the real one, but in her dream. - And what is your name? - My name is Kyunwai So. But everybody call me "Paper". So it's by the ocean? - No. - Where did the whale go? - In her head. She's imagined the whale in her head. - Okay. - And she shot the whale in her head to make a box from the bone of the whale. - Uh-huh. But if she hunted the whale in her head... where did she get the whale bone? - From the dead whale. - In her mind? - Yes. - Wow! - Words. - Memory, a scrap of language, lines of verse that cannot be translated... time past or future visions. - Try to forget. Try to forget. Try to forget. Try to forget... - I'm going to open it. - And with the idea the person who made it that it was a sort of meditation device that you would use in times of sickness, and it almost looked like a model building. It was this beautiful casket-shaped thing. - The road again. And using sound creatively, off screen sound as well as diegetic sound simply as a means of documenting what's in front of the camera. - What can you see? - You just find the right place to go, and that's always a sight within the forest. There might be a rock over there that would allow you access to the time of your great-grandfather, to the moment in the garden. There might be a waterfall over there which allows you to the time of your mother's childhood. There are places you go to, to access time. The ghosts come into the forest. And at that point, linear time begins. - And there would be a voice that would say. All right, roll them. Action. And cut. And what is this woman doing? - I'm not sure. It depends on the gun, is real or fake. - It's a real gun. - It's a real gun. So maybe she is hunting? Is she alone or is somebody with her? - I'm with her. - I'm photographing her. - Mm-hm. - What has she got on her head? - Her head. - Did you jump again? - Yeah. - Right, now put your gun down and one last look through your binoculars. - Or she's invisible maybe like a... like an angel... like... A bit of a naughty angel, like maybe likes to shoot some... I don't know. Butterflies. Not too bad though, but might be a bit naughty. - And if you open this box, you don't know whether good magic will come out... Or bad magic will come out. - Like Pandora? - Like Pandora's box. - Pandora's box. - Philip Hoare. - Philip Hoare. Writer. I mean, the whale has become the new psychic symbol of the new age. And ever since we first put our hydrophone into the water off Bermuda, which is the Island of Strange Noises of the Tempest. Ever since then we've invested the whale with the new sense of the New Age. It's always the whale that encompasses that because the whale is the liminal breacher. It literally and figuratively and psychically breaches between those dimensions. - You should have been called Pandora. She had a curiosity about a box and opened it and let loose all the evil in the world. - Never mind about the evil what's in it? I just want to know what it is. Would you believe me if I told you? Would you be satisfied? - Maybe. - I love the spring. I'm very pleased when the winter and the snow has gone by. I love the spring. - And so to ask Philip first, what was the particular qualities that caused these transcendent visions to descend on this part of the world? - Philip Hoare. - Philip Hoare. Writer. I knew that there witches in the New Forest, I knew that there still were. My mother told me. So I connected that with Mary Ann Girling's witchery, and that connects with that extraordinary tower. Sway Tower, Peterson's Tower, built as a monument as a lighthouse to the psychic science of spiritualism and animal magnetism and all these other weirdness of the bohemian spiritual New Age. Two hundred and sixty people dropped out of the sky. - Putting this box against the power of the tower that Peterson made to communicate with the sounds of the cosmos. He built it out of concrete, but by ascending to the top he would hear the hum of the universe. He would hear this zzzz mmmaaammmm And he would chant against it and maybe he would hear the angels, the angels of wrath around him. And I think that by bringing the box here we can maybe recharge it from that kind of insane angelic energy. - And God prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. Now behold Jonah. Taken up as an anchor. - Which to him looked like the shape of a whale rising up out of the countryside. - The whale leaves that huge body of water which contains 90% of the bio mass of this planet. And leaps out into the universe as a kind of astral extra planetary whale. It becomes the futuristic symbol of the backward abyss of time. As Prospero says in the Tempest. - Part Four. - Steve Dilworth who made the whalebone box has always been a difficult person to question. He never gives you the why. He talks about the opportunity of getting the whalebone from a whale that was washed up on the Isle of Harris, and he makes this object, but then the object takes on a life of its own. And what's fascinating is that Eden Kotting has to go to sleep. She has to put herself into a hallucinated almost amniotic fluid state of dream. Like creatures floating through the forest. The forest is now underwater. - Where are you? Can you see the past? What can you see? - You're fucking English wankers. - At the instant before the box is opened, the cat is equal parts alive and dead at the same time. - Turn and look at me. - This is an animal that we need to try and get off the south coast of the UK. - All ships, all ships. This Oban Radio, Oban Radio. - Where are you now? - I'm at the end of a long black tunnel in which I can see a pinprick of light generally taken to be the spark of mortality. And it's moving. Moving everywhere. - I was trying to remember how old you were when you did have this done, Eden. - When she was first born? - Yes, I would have said three or four months old. - She was virtually blind when she was born. - Okay. - So there was a lot of learning to see in those first few years. - Wasn't there, Eden? - Yeah. - The back of the brain was saying, "What is going on out there? What does it all mean?" - And if you want to go back somewhere in memory, you just find the right place to go. - Right now look through your goggles. Eden. And lean right back and look up at the sky. Higher. Right back. Higher. Higher. Try and look at the sky through the goggles. - Can you see the sky? - Can you lean a bit further back? That's it. Put them right over your eyes. - The women would go into the trees. The trees absorb the women. And the women are the trees. - And that's why the forest is much more supportive as an entity. The forest is a single organic entity. He might have some knowledge. More than you know. That's the homicide squad. Complete with detectives and newspaper men. Nobody important really just a movie writer with a couple of B pictures to his credit. The poor dope, he always wanted a pool. - I'm increasing the load on the machine. - It looks like the box is very heavy. Yeah. But what is inside? I'm very curious. I think he doesn't know what is in the box, right? And why is he holding it? - I mean, if we've got the box slap down there obviously for a set up shot. It's good to have a bit of a sense of it being moved around the landscape. - You're beginning to think like a filmmaker, aren't you? - I was trained in that way. - You're back in Brixton, all those years ago. - In the days that we were thinking about crossing the line and all those things. There was a grammar of cinema in those days, no messing about with phones. - This isn't a phone. - It's a 16mm camera. - Watch out. - Memories are always simultaneously objectively false and subjectively true. - Try to forget. Try to forget. Try to forget. Try to forget. - The whalebone box is returning because it's a finite earth battery made of whalebone and beeswax and honey and lead and it needs to be renewed and also there's a degree of sickness and unwellness on the Isle of Harris and we need to bring the energies of the box which have accumulated over more than 30 years back to source, to see if the calm water that was put into it still is efficacious in bringing health back to the body. - Nostalgia effectively is a longing for a reunion with the homeland, and the strange reality that is confronted. - At your service. That the wheat be cut and that the sheep be sheared. That great hammers and drills may pound and labour. That homes may be run with simplicity cleanliness and economy. That life be made easier. - But it was as if this was the landscape that revealed that the people themselves felt that what was worthwhile was in the land and not in the buildings. They had a deep attachment to place, but not to the specific structures that had been put on the place. And the box was brought back to this household from which it had started many, many years ago. - There is nothing that cannot be used as an ad hoc folly. As a Felicity Beacon, as an iconically iconic icon... and there is apparently no one on the island who is immune to the appeal of the found object and the oxidising object. - Deformity and disrepair of architectural construction signify the ultimate impossibility of translation. - It was a very serious life and death thing as if I was creating some sort of a monster. A bit like somebody tinkering around and making some sort of bomb without realising it. It was that sort of feeling. A lot of people will come up and start inspecting it and then they gradually realise what the thing is about. It is quite dry and they think it's some sort of paper. It's when gradually it dawns on people what the thing is that other sorts of questions may appear. A lot of people will come up and start inspecting it. I don't know what it was, but it felt like a very potent thing and it was a very serious life and death thing. - So what was there you couldn't tell us it was a ruin from the 1950's or if it was something that went right back to the age of the standing stones at Callanish. It was extraordinary. And each of these encounters reinforces your own sense of self as to who you are. The person dissolves into the place. The place completely overwhelms the sense of your own identity. And so essentially you give up that identity and you become part of something bigger than you. We're temporary, we're in this long dialogue with our ancestors and with those who follow us. The living can assist the imagination of the dead. The dead are constantly prompting us. And I think in any form of writing that all you do is fill in a couple of sentences between what was not quite finished and what is just being begun. And I think that's the same thing with death and mortality. Essentially, you would look to the point of dissolving into something grander rather than being put in a box and nailed down in a particular spot. It's much better to be on the move, to be flowing and floating. - Hello. Mr Sinclair? I'm going to open it. - When I said I admired you, I meant what I said. - It has found a place to live. Inside. Where no one can see it or hear it, or feel it. - I know I'm human. - Some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show itself it wants to hide inside an imitation I'm going to open it. - It will fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable. I'm going to open it. - The tail of the plane broke off. It fell... - We need some help down here. - Part Five. - What can you see? Where are you? Do you shoot butterflies? Tthis box was opened and waves of excitement passed through the audience as I cut the steel bands. The box contained the most extraordinary collection of objects. Very curious. This is the most interesting exhibit. Well, I have shown you the very curious contents of the box, but I'm afraid that there was nothing in it to save the nation in a time of emergency. - And I see a whale on the beach. It looks going to die. - I think the image that I just saw is the memory inside a bomb. - You think it's a bomb? - Yeah. - Because the box is made by people. Made by humans. They use the bomb to make the box. But the memory is belongs to the bomb. Not the box. ♪ You must sleep my love ♪ ♪ You must sleep ♪ ♪ You must sleep my love ♪ ♪ You must sleep ♪ ♪ You must sleep my love ♪ ♪ You must sleep... ♪ - Where we are who knows. Guesses where we go. - And maybe the treasure that they speak of is nothing actual. It's not this box. It's nothing that's buried in the sand. It's nothing that's hidden in a cave. It's that strange state of consciousness that you can achieve out of your own confusions. We don't want any record of precisely where it is. I'm not going to say where it is other than it's on the west side of the Island of Harris. There is a lot of that, so you'd have to do a lot of digging to find her. - I think the tide is going to take her away anyhow. - I think another hour, she will be under water. - In the shallow brackish waters of the tidal Thames, the stricken mammal was out of its depth. The 20 foot whale lost and disorientated in the currents. But finally, it was coaxed onto the foreshore. Well, there's still a lot of care and there's still a lot of work to be done yet with this animal. The animal now is in an even more alien environment from where it has been for the last few days. Maybe this is moving now. But obviously, it's been in the shallow area for the last couple of days. Now it's not even in the water, but it's moving, we're on our way. And I think... - I found this piece of film. It was in the belly of a whale and they pulled it out through the whale's mouth.
