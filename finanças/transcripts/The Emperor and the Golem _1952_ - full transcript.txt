EMPEROR AND THE GOLEM Look everywhere ! Hurry ! Hurry ! Look everywhere ! Hurry ! We must find it ! Otherwise, it will go badly for us ! I understand the impatience of his excellency, but I did my best. I offered to his majesty tableaux, music, statues of women. I strived for good humor, but he is haunted by one idea: having the Golem. While he does not have it, he gives audience to no one. Good wine, Chamberlain Lang. But poor prospects. I have been waiting a long time. If I come home empty-handed, King Matthias will be angry. What do you advise, Mr. Chamberlain ? Patience ! When the emperor is in a good mood, I can just draw up papers. Even the abdication. But is it possible that the Golem be truly found one day ? I hope ... Alternatively, the emperor ... ... We must do away... Do not think it, Mr. Chamberlain. My King Matthias prefers finesse to violence. Marshal Russworm. So did you find it ? You've found it ? No ! And you think, Marshal, you will find it ? I think not. I think that there is no Golem. A good wine. But what exactly is the Golem ? Once a wizard came to terms with the devil, and created a ... a.. a bogeyman ! There is no bogeyman. You are the bogeymen ! Since you frighten a little boy. Listen up, Frantisek. It happened quite differently. Once upon a time in Prague ... a rabbi learned ... Rabbi Loew. It was found that energy was immense in the field. Even in ordinary clay. Look, a kitty ! Rabbi made a giant puppet and called Golem. And with a strange mechanism ... What was it called? Shem. And with this Shem, he controlled the Golem. And his colossal strength. What's happened, court astrologer? Don't ask! It's bad, terrible, and it may have incalculable consequences. - For me? - For you, for me, for us all! Imagine that.. Russworm did not find the Golem. - Do you know what that means ? - The Emperor will be displeased. Dissatisfied? He will be furious! He will ... pass his anger ... all over the world! I thought of you, and I ran to warn you ... It's very nice of you. ... to warn you that the breads must be baked today. That crook. It is for scum like him that we slave away. So, the Golem ... Once it happened that Rabbi Loew had forgotten. And this giant began to break everything. He could break the world. The rabbi therefore took the life force and buried it somewhere. - And we don't know where? - Nobody knows, not even the emperor. You must say "His Imperial Majesty," bigmouth. The more you read, the more stupid you are. Instead of yapping, you'd better check the breads, they are well-baked. Yes, breads are baked... for the emperor, good breads! When will you open today ? When there is flour. But you're baking! We bake. But for the emperor. Not for street people. Then you have flour for the emperor, not for us ! That's right, little lady. By the Holy Virgin, do not leave us like this. I leave you like that. I will do nothing. There. You owe me 50 guilders. - But I've already given 20 yesterday. - For the horoscope, correct. But you owe me 50, because I advised you about thoroughly baking the breads. - I can't give it. - You don't give it to me ? I read in the stars that his majesty buys elsewhere. His majesty can not buy elsewhere. I have all the provisions of Prague. And if my horoscope advised the emperor to open the granaries, and share the wheat among all the bakers ? The Chamberlain has promised not to open the granaries, so I have the provisions. Exactly... But the Emperor has more confidence in my horoscope than Lang. Thief ! Good people, catch him ! Thief ! Good people ! Get him ! Come back! Stop running! Come back! When a thief chases another, an honest man has an advantage. Take the breads. They were baked today. Take them home, give them to the children and be happy ! The Emperor is early today. There will be more ... ... for the "tied". Oh Lord ! Creator of heaven and earth, four spirits and four elements, Why do you torture our majesty's teeth ? We could not close our eyes all night ! Our teeth hurt. The tooth hurts ! Here. This must stop ! We have doctors, alchemists, we are bad off. So do something ! Your majesty, if we pulled your illustrious tooth ? He will not say ... Emperor and King Rudolph ... ... Rudolph ... - How many already? - Two, sire. Two have allowed that we touch one of our teeth. You have nothing for the pain ? Something that does not hurt. We're not just anyone ... We are the Emperor. Perhaps the brightness of the king's object, pulled from the bottom of the sea by fishermen from Rhodes, will relieve your imperial majesty. No way. It displeases us. It has no head. In contrast, here is a very interesting head. Now the body is missing. And what's happening with the Golem ? Your Imperial Majesty, it seems that Marshal Russworm has failed. Has not succeeded? - That is to say... the Golem is not ... - Is not ? - Actually, we did not find the Golem. - Not found ? - No. We want the Golem ! - Your Imperial Majesty ... - We need the Golem! We must have Golem ! Everyone out! Out ! We need the Golem. We can not trust anyone but ourselves. Who's looking at me? - Is it still not us ? - But Sire, it's you. It's us. But we're old. Lord, behold this portrait here. It does not lie. It is your spitting image. Except the spitting image of 15 years ago ! Do not try fool us, Lang, that we don't get older. We age. Come here. We grow old so quickly, that night ... when everything is quiet, we can feel the hardening of our arteries. Why is no one here ? We are afraid to stay alone. Everyone here ! - Lang. - Sire? Where is the water of youth ? Scott, the alchemist of your majesty, expedites his work. Yesterday, he found children of virgin and wild thyme, and since this morning, grilled over lichen. Bring this charlatan in, to explain to us where is the water of youth. And that Marshal Russworm must present his report. And if his majesty tasted this elixir? Delicious. - And where does one find this elixir ? - In a mill near Brandis. - And her name ? - Rosalie. Rosalie. But how about, dear master, if we put on a light coat ? But very light ... to paint a shepherdess Amaryllis ? I recognize that taste, your majesty. So, you'll do it? As if you could touch it. And the size, sire ? Size, dear master. Nature requires a size ... ...nature. Lang, if only we knew which is real, we would keep it, and sell the fake as real. But it is possible that the real is also fake. So it's better to keep them all, real or fake. - The program of the day for his majesty. - Lang, make it a brief summary. Tell us only what there is no need to address. Because what is needed, there is no need to read it. There should be given a hearing to the Ambassador of King Matthias. We said what is necessary is not necessary. Three months the ambassador of your your brother is waiting to be received. And we expect for the last thirty years, the devil should take the king, our brother ! What else ? A deputation of aldermen. The grumblers ... Some trouble with wheat, and I don't know what ... After all, you know, sire. - Necessary ? - No. We will stick to the wisdom of the Chamberlain. Next. Tycho Brahe, Astronomer, your majesty, requesting a hearing. - What now? - He needs some... lenses. What relationship between lenses and the stars ? We will give him the lenses. We will leave it alone. No hearing. We don't like such effects when we are not prepared ! My illustrious benefactor. Hieronimus Alessandro Scotti, tell us where is the water of youth. The zodiacal spirits, the fifty - eighth superior intelligence, conspire against a poor old man. This is not what we asked. Perhaps I am mistaken in taking chickweed for the Saturn plant. That is actually fennel. Answer the question we asked ! Where is the water of youth ? Microcosm and macrocosm should have met under the sign of Scorpio. In short, I did not succeed with the elixir of youth. And how much longer do you need ? Maybe a week. Maybe a day. Maybe eight years. I've been busy. Lacking mandrake, I cooked amaranth with the bat. And this is it. A unique product for polishing the floors. The father returns to his pastoral labors. The floor is dull, windows dark. How do you please the household ? Just enough time to cook as he spins at the factory. The woman wept, groaned. She did not sleep until dawn. How can we make the man stay at home ? If the woman has our wax, the man remains at home. It will clean and scrub all stains and traces. The soiled becomes like a mirror, dishes like a new coin. You just polish with a dry cloth and display. It only remains to put down the mark. The astrologer from the court of his imperial majesty. Our astral projections for the noble intestinal tract of your majesty. Mars and Mercury, in sextile left, invites your Majesty's stomach to digest the croissants from the bakery "for the delight of the Emperor" which are particularly crispy today. The moon decreases. Your liver will be appeased by one block of liver sausage ... - "...to the golden apple" - Her Excellency, the Countess Strada. So the Emperor has fun.. We did nothing. It was Scott who did an experiment. I did not think anyone could imitate so perfectly your jokes. - You miss the humor, my dear. - Your humor almost broke my leg. - We are still not as sharp. - But rather ambiguous, as I see. The dealer Vollard of Florence can offer a genuine Mona Lisa. - But this would be the thirteenth. - Exactly. It may be that this one is good. In my opinion, we must buy. Of course he should buy it. If there are twelve false, then why not thirteen ? Since when do you mix in art, my dear countess ? Since I know you, your majesty. And we know each other long enough to be married. For a wedding, you run out of money, but not for a painting. We're both too poor. For me, the money. For you, nobility. Sire, don't let the anger shake your majesty. The financial situation is not ... Don't let the truth of the account drop, Mr. Chamberlain. Say clearly that for the last week, we have lived in debt. Here is a query of Marshal Russworm about military matters. Let's see. Five thousand gold florins to gild the armor. The breastplates. - Five... - Five. - Dozens ... - Dozens. ... here for the corset of General Belgioso. That's crazy ! We must deprive ourselves of the Mona Lisa so they can shake their navel in a gold corset? Can I suggest a quick solution? Just a signature of your majesty. How many of our imperial slates are set up in your bazaar ? How many times ? The two. We'll take the Mona Lisa at all costs. Your excellency.. Marshal of the Imperial armies, Bernard Russworm. Watch, it will be like a hardware store collapsed. Where is the Golem ? Pursuant to the orders of your majesty, I launched my troops into the synagogue. But no trace of the Golem. Sure, if you drink and fence until dawn.. if you like the dice, or the short skirts, the view becomes uncertain and the head is submerged in wine. He did not find the Golem ! It makes sense. He was busy counting his plumes, his stripes, his armor, his sword.. You are thieves and scoundrels ! Get out ! Don't get excited, sire. But we're not excited. - So you're not angry with me ? - We, why ? I feel that there are days when I get on your nerves. Not at all. I'll just break everything. Give us something to eat. It seems that today the croissants are especially crisp. - Is this true ? - No, this is not true, majesty. Especially today, there are no crusty croissants. And why ? A sort of mad baker distributed the imperial croissants to the poor. To the poor ! Very good ! And we die of hunger ! Stop the baker immediately and throw him in the dungeon. We'll see who holds on longer ! Someone ! Help ! Everyone here ! - What is it ? - Help ! What's happening there ? Help ! Sire, it is Master Edward Kelley, master of two kinds of magic, alchemy and occult. You yourself deigned to invite him. I know, we are aware. But why is there so much racket ? Because he is a magician. It needs to stop. It could cause us a toothache. Tell Lang to fix everything. What are you doing here ? We sleep. Get out ! His Imperial Majesty has instructed me to welcome you, master Kelley. I burn with desire to pay tribute with the greatest of modern magic. The best home for you and your menagerie. Thank you. May I ? Ah, dear astrologer. How happy I am to see you, master Kelley. I heard they failed to hang you in Brussels. These are occupational hazards, you know. But you, it seems you have failed to be forgotten in Nuremberg. Here, there will be nothing like that. So there will be no roadblocks. Let us not inconvenience each other as fellow scientists. Agreed ... We support each other. Stay well. Marshal Russworm. Master Kelley. Cheers. Good wine. There ... Within a moment will fall a second drop. Water, come on. It falls in drops. But it could also be ... food that falls ... At least mashed potatoes. Even though I hated it since childhood, now, I wouldn't mind it to fall. Fall.. But it will not fall. That's the last time you deceive me ! Not so loud. We are at Prague Castle. That's why you have put me in this thing, for I don't know how long ? Nobody must know that you're here. - Why ? - Because I must first be made. Eat, calm down, rest. Afterwards, I'll explain. Who's there ? A prisoner. Who's there ? A prisoner also. A prisoner who eats chicken ? I never heard of it ! What should I say ? I am a true prisoner. I wither and I'm dying here. - You are a murderer ? - No. I am a baker in a dungeon. My name is Matej Kotrba. - And you, what is your name? - Katrina. In general, Katrinas are scarce. Not in my case. You are ... still... a little ... ... strong ? If you want, a little ... strong. - But not too much ? - Not too much. - And you are large ? - Yes, quite large. And married? -Oh, no ! - Very good. Tell me ... Are you big enough ... ... to put your head ... ... on my shoulders ? I don't know how big are your shoulders. My shoulders ? Wide. And how big are you ? As a poplar. And so slim ? Slender as a poplar tree ? This poplar, it must then be like a beech. You have a funny laugh. But I'm glad that you were locked up here. At least we can talk together. Master Edward Kelley. We salute you, dear master. We are pleased to see you here. I am extremely happy that your majesty has deigned to honor me with this gracious invitation. Don't worry. We invite all sorts of people. We are the Emperor and can afford it. What have you to show me ? A word first, if I may, sire. Something excellent. For years I've worked to create an artificial being. A Homunculus ? A Homuncula, sire. - Homuncula ! - An artificial woman. Bravo, dear master. And where are you with it? Under the eyes of your majesty, I distill global species most subtle. And I condense the fluid thus obtained of a female creature. A woman who is only fluid ! That will be nice. But we also want to please you. You have probably heard about our "Cuceimpal"? -What ? - Cu-Ce-imp-Al. Central Kitchen of Imperial Alchemists. Of course. What modern scientist has not heard ? Well, you'll see it now. Continue your research, as if we were not here. Look, look, look. Here is an example. Here, we prepare the dye Trismeguiste, which can become invisible. Be careful. You see us ? Just a little. Evidently, too much fat of toad. We are dedicated primarily to the manufacture of gold. Gold is a good thing. Here, we produce it with plums. But don't tell anyone. Nobody has yet thought to make gold with plums. Explain to Master Kelley. Kjamla Lalich ... Paprtala, achano, achano ... Jalal Jalal, paprtala ... Tas kvartal zamast piskurti ... Zblouch. You see ? We trust him without understanding. But how to do this without an interpreter ? One day, we will be at the door. - Patlaba ... Paprtala. Another method of making gold. By mechanical means. Explain how you do it. - I break the atoms of lead. - And your results ? No, you know, it depends of how you smash them. - But I'll get there. - There you go. Only specialists for us. Let's see some more. He always wanted to fly. And where is our elixir of youth ? The elixir of youth, sire, there is none. At least for now. But however, I managed an excellent product of another kind. The stranger will allow ? A spot is easy to get. But how to get rid of it ? With our product, rub ... ... gently. And there ... The spot is gone. The stranger will excuse me. The stranger will excuse you. But the Emperor will not excuse you. No, the Emperor will throw you to the lions. At least for once, they'll have a good snack! Sire, I have the water of youth. - Look, I just grate the mandrake. - May I? It's horseradish, sir. I tried horseradish as a substitute. Of course ! You can always count on Mr. Scott to eat horseradish. That is research ? Scientific work ? You're not able to get the true mandrake! Probably.. But I should need a dog of English blood, whelped the ninth day after sunset. Where can I find it? Where? I have exacly such a dog in my inventory. Take it from me, as a favor to science. Well, what else ? An aide to initiate spells, who will hold the sword to pierce the dog, and toil in the earth to dig up the mandrake. For a fact, I can't find one. Consider it found. Wait for us today at midnight on the hill of hanging. What are you doing ? Smoke comes out of your mouth. A novelty of the new world. If your majesty wishes to taste ... suck the smoke through the mouth this way. Draw ... with the mouth ... It will never be popular here. - Are you afraid? - I'm afraid. - Very afraid ? - Very afraid. We too are afraid, but it makes us happy. Provided there is no storm. We do not like the storm. The mandrake. Scotta, get ready for the great invocation. As soon as I utter the name Samael, you plunge the sword into the body of this dog. - Are you afraid ? - I'm afraid. That's good. Begin. Firstly, with eyes closed. pronounce three times slowly ...the name ... Agla. Then open your eyes and look around. If heat rises, this indicates that the elements are favorable to our actions. We can begin the invocation. And so... Close your eyes. Agla. Very good ! The elements are benevolent to us. Come on, Scott. When I say the name Samael, you do it. Pay attention, we begin. So.. Spirits reigning, and all your subjects, we ask favor this blessed hour. Salaam. Help the success of our endeavor, master.. Samael! So what are you waiting for ? This brave beast looks at me in a way ... After all, this is a dumb creature. Well, impale it, that silent creature ! I cannot. Give me that. Scott ! Sire, I'm here. What are you doing? I don't know, it's dark. Light, light. The Golem ! Scott ! We have the Golem ! We found the Golem ! He can not animate the Golem himself. He needs the Shem Ha M'forasch. What would it take him ? A formula that animates the Golem. He who knows, Golem obeys his word. Obeys! God in heaven! You realize, if the Golem walked in front of our troops! It would put in the dirt an entire battalion, a regiment, an entire army ! Don't yell. It must be. But this is not a philanthropic attitude. Suffice it to say that we have the Golem, and then, we just dictate our terms. - What's going on, gentlemen ? - Nothing, nothing. The moon has gone twice around the earth, Golem, and we lack the breath to continue to persuade you. What more do you want? We've offered you power and glory. We've offered you our friendship. We've offered you mountains and marvels. And you say nothing. Why, wise rabbi Besalel Ben Jehuda Löwe.. Why do you not reveal to us where you hid the Shem, which animates the Golem? Why don't you listen to reason ? Golem. We beg you. We need you. You know, basically, nobody loves us. This does not satisfy you that the emperor falls on his knees before you ? You remain silent? Well we'll show you who we are ! We will destroy you ! We have the means ! You obey, or else you cease to be. We will break you into lumps of clay. You will be crushed ! Trampled ! Reduced to dust. What's on ? Something shot, sire ! It is we who learn. And we can learn when we please, and as we please, because we are the Emperor, and not just anybody ! Come over here, master Kelley. Go away, you fellows. Forward, march ! Kelley. We are tired. The Golem will not obey us. Even the cannon can't make it reason. Look at the smoke coming out. He has incredible strength. Kelley, arrange for our Golem to obey us. Immediately. Unfortunately today, the astral constellation is not favorable to animate the Golem, but I did not expect it to also support the creation of Sirael. Sirael ? Sirael ! That woman of fluid that you promised to condense. -Yes, sire. - Great, great. But create something young ... appetizing... something ... That's it. But immediately after, you will animate the Golem. Katerina, have you thought that we might be related ? Not necessarily brother and grandmother. But husband and wife ? Matej, beware ! Eat in a hurry. Then get dressed. I'll be back in a moment. We'll do a rehearsal. Kelley, I won't work. - No ? - No ! It's simple. Nobody knows you're here. And when you die of hunger, no one will get you. But you're a sensible girl, and you'll change your mind. Matej, you hear that? I heard well. If there was not this wall, I assure you I'd waltz over. Yes, but there is a wall. You must go, or you will starve. But you also. I'm unimportant. But it should not happen to you. Because I love you. - I love you, too. - You see ! Two people who love each other, and can not even see. No hole in front of me. How could I ... How are you ? Marooned. I prefer chestnuts. Katrina, be cautious. I never stop thinking of you. Or me you. Don't forget me. Here is a present. I will not forget. But to be sure, I'll make a knot. - Are you afraid? - I'm afraid. - Very afraid ? -Very afraid. Shh, no noises, no crackling. Sirael, the time has come. But what are you eating? Peanuts. Peanuts ! How can you eat that ? Well, that's a good job. In the name of Briah. In the name of Jelisah. In the name of Azrach. - Kelley, I'm exhausted. - Shut up. I appeal to you, genii of the seven planets. Look with favor on this great undertaking. In the name of the intelligence that you generate, thy name is ... Sirael. Do not touch it, sire, please. The substance is too fragile. It may evaporate. Sirael is ignorant of any knowledge or human feelings. Sirael is the astral twin ... of Golem. Perfect ! We are going to get engaged. And a new being out of our union. It will have the charm of Sirael, the size and strength of the Golem. And finally, we'll have a friend. Do not touch, sire. The substance is too fragile. Yes, we are aware. Dear Master ... Tomorrow, we begin to give lessons to Sirael. We'll give her all the knowledge ... and then love. There, that's the end for me. Not at all. We must finish what we started. Besides, you have nothing to lose. Your money is not worth it to be burned as a witch. Things other than money are concerned. I know very well what it is. The Emperor wants me to know love. It's precisely what I don't want. You're still an artificial woman. Any feeling like love is unknown to you. The emperor will not dare touch you. He thinks you'd evaporate. If he touches me, I'm not going to evaporate, but strike, Emperor or not. Now, your imperial majesty can touch with his fingertips. But slowly, so it won't evaporate. Yes, yes. As the light breath of wind. If your imperial majesty has need of something ... I can handle it. Farewell, dear master, goodbye. Sirael. Dear child. Thank you. We bear the historic task ... to inculcate ... human feelings to the astral. We'll start with the word. For the word was at the beginning of everything. And if the word makes man, why not women ? So, dear child, the word ... divides into syllables. And syllables, into vowels and consonants. We begin today with vowels. So, a - e - i - o - u. Repeat after me. Excellent, my dear. Excellent. Now... My child ... Form the lips like a kiss. Watch out, it will evaporate. And, oh, it's here. And phew, it is gone. She laughs. It's a good sign. The smile melted the ice of indifference. As a light spring breeze, like the touch of a hummingbird. Accept our sincere thanks. A break! His Majesty was not satisfied ? We were satisfied, but it could be better. Anything within my power? We wonder what is your power. Have you animated the Golem ? We want to know when you will animate the Golem. Sire, I assure you I do not think of anything else. You have disappointed us, master. Deeply disappointed. And you dear Countess, we ask in the future, when we are occupied with scientific works ... So you say. This scientific work.. ...he shuts himself in with artificial women and wants to instill feelings. I saw how you almost made it evaporate. - What have you found ? - A kaleidoscope. Let's see. It all makes sense now. Playing with such toys. Animating puppets of clay, ...educating artifical girls. Sure. But a faithful wife of flesh and bones ... No, that's not fashionable in the court of his imperial majesty. Next time, let me finish at least. It's enough to lose one's appetite. What happened next? Tell me. Then came the Countess Strada. And that's all. And if she had not come ? If she had not come, I knew I must go away. Good night, Matej. Good night. That statement does not please me. Neither does this. Dear child, today we are dancing. Dance. This movement is regulated by aesthetics. Better yet, it is the gateway to love. Our heart beats faster. The music awakens the senses. And we want to love. From the first moment, beautiful creature, that love is for you. Something mysterious, from the beginning. We are alone. While my right hand ... feels the velvet in your hair, the left discovers the marble in your shoulder. Your flesh shines between the lace. Our Hapsburg lips stick eagerly. Wait. Our powerful breath extinguishes all the lights. And in the sudden darkness, Sirael, bursts the time of the Rudolphs. You understand, love ? Speak. What do you feel ? Rum. Oh God! Why do you torture the senses of our majesty? What are you, a ray ? A fluid ? You are a log ! Wood taken up from the roots! A burden ! Did you sleep well, sire ? You have a toothache ? No, we wear this to please you. We have a toothache. Too sweet. Too vinegary. - Where are you going ? - To find a dentist. - Don't leave! - Sire, the countess.. Shut up ! And send for Kelley. And tell him that his artificial woman.. No, don't tell him anything. We'll settle it ourselves. - Nothing has happened to Sirael, sire? - Nothing! Exactly! We advise you to eat your breakfast. We have a toothache. Very bad. You do not, Sire? No, because we are sad. Today, we will solve nothing. No, we will not solve anything. Everything will be adjourned. -Postponed ... - Yes. But you should receive the Ambassador of your serene brother. But Lang, you see that I am a sick man. An audience would sign our death warrant. But the ambassador of your serene brother is already waiting for three months ... Well, good. Let's drive the old man to his death! Go ! Prepare beer, dig a pit, we'll see your ambassadors, deputies, decorated, delegations! We will see everyone all at once. We will receive, sign, govern ... So what is it ? Quickly, without hesitation. Sire, our gracious king and father. Faster, faster. Time is money. The harvest is failing. Give us something to sign. Our pen is ready. Since the country was hit by famine.. and the people suffer from hunger ... In person, Master Kelley. Know, then, dear sir, that the artificial beauty, the stick that you created from a combination of pine and fir, your Sirael, you can send it packing! - I will do my best. - Wait. You do your best to follow our instructions. Which, for the record, is to animate the Golem. And if you do not animate it, you go home to England cut into two pieces. - Understand ? -Understood. - Get out of here ! -I'm going. Wow ! Not bad. Pretty good. I should learn it. It might be useful to me from time to time. Where were we? People are hungry, sire. And the imperial barns are full. - Give orders to open them. - Lang, come here. What is this? We didn't know we had barns. Sire, I will undertake to resolve this with the bourgeois gentlemen. Then, resolve.. and meanwhile, secure the barns. It's settled. Your Imperial Majesty ... General Belgosio refuses to march against the Turks. Because he has no guts ? It is well known. There is no misunderstanding. And if you're not satisfied, simply leave. That, as a reward for my merits ? The nonexistent. Tinplated beauty. You.. what did you say, sire ? We said "tinplated beauty"! Who makes you laugh? We, perhaps? - Who is that? - Ambassador of your serene brother. My gracious king, the brother of his imperial majesty, the glorious Matthias ... asked me to put into your illustrious hands a personal letter. We will not read this letter. We know the secret desires of our brother. He wants the throne, to govern. And we would go begging in the streets. My eye! Sire, may I ... No, you are not permitted with the Holy Roman Emperor, King of Bohemia. And let us not see you again here ! And you all too. Boasters! Horse thieves! Renegades! We'll sweep you out! Leave this camp! Outside, idiots! Scoundrels! Merchants! But it's too pretty. Where was it? We were seeking it for years. Put it in our collection. Be careful not to break it. I'm leaving today. I'll make King Matthias aware of the treatment I have suffered. -But, your excellency ... - Here is half of the seal of my king. He will present the other half to the on who will have the right to give orders. - And who is he, your excellency? - I do not know. The important thing is that he enjoys the royal confidence. Good night, and good wishes. Well, we don't really know where we're at. Someone here has the other half of the seal. Who will get and give orders ... And we must obey. We do not even know who he is. Anyone who will command me, and give me orders ... to cut the emperor in half, I'll do it! But who told you not to? - Nobody told us anything. - But I must tell you. - Highly honored Master Kelley. - Why did you not say anything earlier ? Now the time has come. - Then, I will cut him! - King Matthias would grieve. We must get rid ... of his imperial majesty by providing forms. You see, Marshal. Forms... - It's for the record. - But we cannot do it. I know that the emperor will sign anything the Chamberlain gives, without even reading it. And if one day, instead of trafficking ... .. you made him sign his abdication? - That could work, Lang. Just a tiny abdication. To start. Only Bohemia. - The stone that becomes an avalanche. - Come and look at this. I found something. It's round. Let me see. - It's nothing. - Let me, let me. - And if it was something? - And if it was Shem? And if it was Shem ! That goes ... there. Stop ! It stopped him. Stop ! You see. It obeys the one who animates it. Remove it. - What? - The Shem! Golem ! Remove it. Stop, Golem. Gentlemen, this is interesting. The Shem is hot. - Give me that. - One moment. - Why give it to you? - I was asked to animate the Golem. Bullshit! Give me that. It was I who found it. Get back! So there is no misunderstanding, either all or none, or it's just me. Then let all of us. - Naturally. - Sure. See how easy it is to agree if we are allies. Now, Shem is for all of us. But where is it ? It was just here It must be somewhere! Pretty. And young. Just what it takes to stroll in meadows, and listen to the finches whistle. What ? These things are not for you: ceremonies, exposition, delegations, decrees ... Stop. Remember, sire, a different time ? You think of Blazen ? Yes. She was married to a squadron leader, who had returned from Budejovice earlier than expected. A brawl broke out. I can see you like today, jumping from the window onto a poplar. - And falling in ... - In the compost, you can say it. It was nice. Even in the compost. But it's the past. Comrade, youth is gone, and both of us, we stayed here. Sire, they are old stories. What do you miss about it ? Only one pair of young arms around the neck. Come, sire, leave here. Forget the whole mess and leave. Both of us, as in the good old days. - Where ? - To Brandis, find a beauty. All right ! All right ! A little bit of Brandis. But don't you think that we're a bit old ? Think, sire! If you get done up by the barbers ... The barbers.. it's been years that we dressed up. And in vain. But wait. We may be able with the water of youth. Go see where Scott is. And then, off to Brandis! Where is the water of youth ? Perhaps from out of fear of the anger of his majesty, or something more ... The water of youth, ... I have it, but it is undrinkable. - Undrinkable? - It is ... ... sticky. It sticks so well it can fix the broken china ... So there is no misunderstanding, Mr. Chief alchemist... Either you make us by midnight, a water of youth, drinkable and non-sticky ... or your head ... Guess what? Cut. There you go. And remember that the executioner works day and night. Matej, your dinner. Who is this Matej? Who is it ? - It's me ! - Matej, help ! - Who is it ? - Matej, help ! If you touch her, you'll see. I'll put an end to you! I will kill you, I will slay ... I ... - Who is it ? - Matej, my Matej. We love each other. - You love ! - Yes, I love. Why did you never tell me? As such, you don't have him, your Matej. Only the Emperor can help. And only one ... a more enthusiastic Sirael ... could ask him. You know? You're lucky. It's almost 5 o'clock. Your majesty will excuse me. Your hourglass is fast. - Because it's bigger. - Yes. Beware that it is not that polish ... .. or glue. - Certainly not. It smells good ... Go ahead and drink. It will do you no harm. - Can I go ? - Go ahead. Sire, your bath is ready. We'll be there. Just in time to rejuvenate. - He really believes he is younger ? - He believes everything. This is a mistake, a mistake. So what do you think ? He has either rejuvenated or I'm crazy. We have been rejuvenated by God! What ? - We have spoken? - Yes. - We look at each other? - Yes. And our strength? Good. - And our age? - 35. 35 years ! We have rejuvenated ! We have rejuvenated ! On to Brandis ! On ... ..to.. ... Brandis. Sire, the carriage awaits. And we're off to Brandis. - And our strength? - Superb. Because we are 35 years old. - And you ? - 60. 60? Then wait. We will return you ... to ... 30. No, you'd be younger than us. Go ahead. Have a drink. Before I forget, Madame Countess arrives with the dentist. What? Why didn't you tell me sooner? Let's go. This is a mistake! Anesthesia. This is not possible. He has really rejuvenated. Don't be profane. We are the real doctors, we will verify. With your permission. No traces of rotten teeth. The seventh.. ... and eighth were missing, and here. Bizarre, bizarre. - He has really rejuvenated? - Yes. Probably after drinking my water of youth. I do not think it was your elixir. I am a doctor. While I don't discount entirely the emperor's word, neither do I believe. Wait until tomorrow morning. Carry His Majesty to the bedroom, quickly ! Scott. - Yes. -Your method ? According to corpulence. - Watch him. - I shall. - Come and sit next to us. - I cannot. Now you can. Sit next to the emperor. Outside, it will blow wildly, because we will run with the wind. Race with the wind ! So whip the horses, or do snapping your fingers, or do tss tss. Or something so that we should go. On then ! Oops ... ... good people ... ... there is a mistake ... - They didn't hit you too, did they? - Hit? - Who are you? - Do you not recognize me? - No. - The water of youth worked. Me neither, I did not recognize you. - And now you recognize me? - Yes. You'll take your bread home now ? What do you mean, Rudolph ? You confuse me with another. I am Matej. You're not Matej, you're Rudolph. - My two Rudolphs. - No. - King of Rome, by the grace of God. - No. - The pillar of the empire. - No. - King of Bohemia and Dalmatia. - Madam, you are mistaken. - Archduke of Austria. - No. - Margrave of Moravia, Prince ... - No. You are mistaken, Madame ... Madam, you are mistaken. Be reasonable, if Katerina had so ... Madam. I've carried many bags ... but you are like wet corn. Where to put you ? Here, no. Wait. I'll ... put you ... here. Madam, you take me for the emperor. People often take me for the emperor. And I'm not surprised. I could mistake myself also. But now what? If I tell them I am the Emperor's baker, they will kill me. But if I am not the Emperor's baker, I can find Katerina, and I can settle accounts with that magician. The night will bring the answer. A miracle! There came a miracle! - What ? - His Majesty has rejuvenated. Hello. Thank you. You are Katerina ? You are Katerina ? Thank you. A miracle. No miracle. It is my water of youth that produced this effect. And what are the ingredients ? The only thing I didn't forget is what I didn't put in it. - And what did you put in it ? - That's what I forgot. - And what did you do? - That I do not know. Hey, you there ! - Me ? - You. Call chamberlain Lang. This is chamberlain Lang. You're Mr. Lang ? - Yes, sire. - Call me Mr. Kelley. -- Master Kelley. - Master Kelley. Come here. Here I am, sire. Where is Sirael ? But your majesty commanded me ... to send it... - Where? - Packing. I never said anything like that. And you'd better speak more politely. Otherwise, I will send you packing. Sirael, the time has come. - What is it? - Breakfast, sire. My god, what a beauty. What children. How beautiful. And that statue.. she is also very beautiful. There are so many beautiful things here. And all this for one man. All this deserves to be seen by many more people. This is the Golem ? Where did you find it? But ... It was just found, sire. I imagined it a little different. But it is sturdy nonetheless. If only we could wake it up and exploit its strength. How much work and worry could we save people. An excellent idea. Keep them to clear up how all women are the same. - What is it? - Breakfast, sire. He's crazy. - The abdication is ready ? - Yes. I think he is ready to sign. Our astral projections for the noble stomach of hi majesty Rudolph II. The happy combination of Saturn with Mercury ... calls for the consumption of meat. I get it. You advocate certain goods, then ask for cash allowances. Horoscopes are a successful business, aren't they? However, now, this combination is finished. And - "For the delight of the Emperor" ... say goodbye to that bakery. And you, note this. The bakery "For the delight of the Emperor" will be our trusted partner. What a feast. Everyone sit. Let us eat before it gets cold. What manners, dear Lang. The ladies have nothing to sit on. Chairs! Eat, drink and be merry. Fill the glasses. There is everything you need here. Don't worry. There's plenty here. Hare, pheasant ... When everything is eaten, we will buy more. Mr. Lang, are you plotting something ? No, sire. But strange things are happening. The valet of your majesty and Countess Strada are missing. The countess is sleeping on a cloud. And the valet does not interest me at the moment. Because there is enough here. But I am interested in purchasing, Mr. Lang. Starting today, purchases will be made without black magic. - And at wholesale prices to save money. -We cannot. The treasure is barely enough for the table of his majesty. But who needs pig's milk, pheasants and hares for breakfast? - What do the servants eat? - Bacon, eggs, and beer, It's enough for me too. There's no need for that, sire. I can unlock money. To ensure that your order is executed. I just have to have the illustrious signature of his majesty. What have you in the eye ? -You wink ? -It was a draft. There are drafts from the keyholes. - Two, sir, two. - Wait for me to read it. If His Majesty wants to settle ... bacon, eggs and beer, then ... Wait ... eggs ... bacon ... beer. I read here Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia. And that I renounced the throne. What is this? A sort of joke, sire. You call this a joke? Where are you going, master Kelley? You have a clear conscience, do you? - And this? - Sir, I think ... Shall I ask the captain of the guard ... Sire, do not let anger shake your majesty. Me, nothing shakes me. But you, you will shake, Mr. Lang. Yet with me, there are ways to discuss things. What would you give me to tear it up? A thousand. This is worth a thousand, eh ? - Five. - And twenty. Paid cash. Write! The imperial barns will be open for the good of everyone. The poorest receive free bread. There will be bread as much as you want, for twenty-five miles around. Listen, Lang. -Do you have lunch here often? - Often. You know, if our business is so bad, perhaps you should host us. With the greatest pleasure, sire. Then it's settled. Now I have to do this. He has gone mad. You heard what he said of Strada ? She is sleeping on a cloud. - I bet he killed her. - I'll put him on a spit. It's fast and it's noble. But Matthias wants to save him for the forms. Or not? Let's say if we find the Shem, we ourselves can animate the Golem. In this case, we could very well do without ... - Matthias. - And Rudolph. Is it really Rudolph ? Rudolph or not, brunette or redhead, what does it matter? You see, gentlemen, we can forgive much, but when our property is affected, it is intolerable. - That's why I want to put him on a spit. - You better keep quiet. Eat ... and drink. - Gentlemen, how are we going to ... - get rid of the Emperor? It's simple. He has lunch with you today, Lang, no ? - Yes, but I have nothing certain in mind. - I've got something. With water ? With wine is better. And in the market: whoever measures or weighs the goods, dishonestly, or with greed, will be obliged to repair the damage, and at night, for punishment, must clean up the market. That's all. Give that document the imperial seal, and make it public. And replace yourself with a table of four wooden legs, so that your two human legs can do a more productive job. Aren't you ashamed to come like this to the office? - What is it? - Time for Sirael, sire. Do not open it. Sire, I must explain to you. Sire, what happened to you today? - You changed everything. - For the better? Or worse ? - Changed. - Changed. And what do you want ? I wanted to tell you that I am a an ordinary woman of flesh and blood. I don't need to learn love from you. I know it, and I'm even in love. In love? - And to whom? -A baker. - A nice and beautiful baker? - I don't know. I've never seen. So you love someone you never saw ? And if you are not pleased when you see him ? If, for example, he was like me ? Not very slim. - Not so young. - If he was like you, I'd love him too. Really? I do not know if that is a good sign for me. Sire, I beg you, free Matej. It very difficult, my dear. How can his Majesty the Emperor release Matej if his Majesty does not know where Matej is? And if Matej did not know where now was his majesty? Your Majesty the Emperor is not speaking seriously. I'm serious. Very serious. See how I'm serious. Katerina ! She loves me. But she did not know it was me. Tycho Brahe. - The astronomer? - Of your majesty the emperor. - What can I do for you? - Well ... I asked your imperial majesty a lens for my telescope. And here's what I was ... given. Legumes! Professor, it is the bureaucracy. But it will work out in time. You know what? Take breakfast now. Lang is impatient. Come. After you, Professor. Come with us, ladies, we will laugh. You have not seen anything like it. Leave it all, fellows. Come have lunch. And you ladies, work can wait. It's time for soup. We will have lunch with Lang. What are you doing with that ball ? Come have lunch with us. Chamberlain will give you bones. They are good small bones. The Emperor will be here. Master Kelley to his left and me to his right. And I put myself where ? Gentlemen, what shall we do ? What shall we do ! When everything is at its worst, I will break, pierce, grind to dust. - Wait, wait ... - One moment. What are you doing? - Let's keep calm. - Come with me. Come, good people. Do not be offended, Mr. Lang, that we are a small number. But once they knew I was coming to your home, these brave people accompanied me. Is there enough room for everyone? But sire, it's very simple. Take these people into the cellars, and care for them in the kitchen. Please follow me, people. Follow me, please. Sit down, Professor. It's interesting. So you support ... that our planet is the center of the universe. I affirm nothing, sire. I guess only that the sun revolves around the earth. Gentlemen, come sit. It's really interesting. What do you want, the ball ? He has often come to the notion ... the sun, when it does not shine, must be somewhere. Precisely because it illuminates the other hemisphere, as it turns. But wait. Our planet could rotate around the sun. And that would be the same. His Majesty mentioned Copernicus. What's happening there ? The little dog, sire. He wanted to play with a ball. So why are you taking it ? - Give it to him. - Go, I'll give it to him. I know how to handle dogs. Go, I'll give it to him. Enough. Instead of learning with the teacher, you take the toy from the dog and act like children. Give me that. Now, there will be peace. Lang. - And lunch? - I await your orders, sir. In this case, I give the order to serve. - What is it ? - Where are we ? - What's going on? - I don't know. I was scared. Where are we ? And what are we doing here ? We were going somewhere. - But the coach is stopped. - I'm afraid. Do not touch us. We're not anybody important. We know. We had a snack. We were in a forbidden place. I do not know where. What shall we do ? We must go quickly, before Strada did finds out. But where ? Up hill and down dale, or vice versa. But quickly! Go on, hut ! Lang, the breakfast is excellent. It's better here than the emperor's. And your wine, too, is better. Pour me another glass. And the teacher will have the goodness to complete Copernicus's explanation. My colleague, Copernicus, Sire, has different views from mine. According to his theory, it's not the Earth which is the center of the universe, but the sun. Imagine the sun ... Let's say the glass is ... the sun. - The sun, therefore, remains motionless. - Thank you. And the other planets revolve around it in a certain order. Mercury ... Venus ... Earth ... Mars ... And the others ... The closest planet is Mercury. Suppose this is ... Mercury. Here, Venus. - Where is the earth? - Excuse me, sire. Here is the earth. Beside it, the moon. Mars. Then, Jupiter and Saturn. And imagine, sire, that all movement of the universe ... takes place simultaneously and reciprocally. Everything rotates ... turns ... closer ... and further away. And amidst all this ... according to their fixed orbit ... Saturn and Jupiter. It is an ingenious mechanism. And no collision ? It is not excluded. There are planets wandering whose orbit is not fixed. And if one of them, accidentally knocked on ... Excuse me, sire. There is no harm, Professor. In fact, what planet have you thrown? - It was my moon! - No, it was my Mars! - You are mistaken, it was my Mercury! - This was my Venus! Gentlemen, such noise for a few drops of wine. That is to say, sire ... we don't know which cup was yours. It's not important. And no more arguing. Lang, pour me another drink. The professor's sun did not reverse. We can drink to his health. Gentlemen, raise your glasses. To our teacher ! Gentlemen, what's going on ? Raise your mugs. Long live our teacher ! Well, gentlemen ? What, did you poison my wine? Cheers. What's on ? The wine is no good ? Sire. We emptied the larders and cellars of the house. It was not long. We would invite you into our kitchen for alchemists to present an amazing experience. - With gold? - No, with plums. It's pretty strong! How do you make it? Tell his imperial majesty how you do it. Wait. Speak like everyone else. You have nothing to fear. Right ? Of course he has nothing to fear. It's very simple. I pour the plums, ferment.. cool, heat, re-cool.. I pour, I drink, I think it's good. Call it the "secret of Rudolph." No, forget Rudolph and the Emperor. This brandy called Slivovice. Pour, drink, to taste and be gay. And you, what do you do ? I construct a perpetual motion device. And you? - I condense darkness. - You condense darkness? - And you? - I work at making gold. And you, what do you simmer in this pot? I distill liquor of invisibility. Liquor of invisibility! In fact, here you practice all nonsense. Someone among you wants to be invisible ? No ! There. Forget making the gold and all such nonsense. And invent rather something useful. Invent, for example ... something for women so they don't have calloused palms. They have hands of velvet, hair of silk, teeth of pearls and cheeks of satin. Illustrious scholars ... notable chemists ... brilliant teachers, apothecary gentlemen ... astrologers, mathematicians, agronomists, psychiatrists ... Masters of geology, psychology, theology ... of pernicious diseases, obvious, latent ... Inventors of objects ... patents. Magnificents. In a word, intellectuals. Here is a carpenter, a tinsmith, a mason, and one who cuts the stone, a stonemason. This is a maid, a laborer, a fraud. This is a sweep. Washed, you would not recognize him. This one paves the streets, forges horseshoes. feeds the chickens, does confectionary. It can do this, that one can do that. And together can do much. And here is a sheet metal worker, a coachman, a miner. I descend into the mine and extract minerals. And here is a fisherman, a juggler, a piper. I'll play all the songs on bagpipes. I wash leathers. I make shoes. I grow roses. I mend pants. This one can do this, that one can do that. And together, we can do much. We'll all be better off, if you give us your advice we give you ours. If everyone does his job, there will be bread and wine for everyone. There will be wider streets, horseshoes stronger. Chickens, geese, confectionary, pastry. If this one gives this, and that one that, there will be enough for everybody. Makers of leather, silver to buy shoes. And roses in her hair, pants and brand new. And oil for the machines. And machinery for work. And work without a struggle. After work, fun. And the sun in abundance for old, for young and children in our joy, and joy for our children. Love the world. Love peace. And we'll all ... work for this world. If everyone puts his in, there will be bread and wine for everyone. What a pathetic attempt, gentlemen. We almost poison ourselves, and the Emperor has Shem in the pocket. What shall we do ? Whatever we do, we must do.. together. Absolutely, promise it solemnly. On behalf of civilization! When eight o'clock in the morning rings, we'll meet here. Each will make a suggestion regarding getting rid of the emperor.. And seizing the Golem. On behalf of civilization. And the three of us, if we met at seven o'clock ? Ok. On behalf of civilization. And both of us, if we meet at six o'clock ? You seem to know your way around here. I know all entries and secret exits. But this, I never used it. It does not surprise me, Look at your size. In my life, I've ever seen macaroni so plump. Because I am not a macaroni. Neither am I Alessandro nor Scott. - Who are you? - Me? Antoine Cocher of Prague. But tell me... these are things to say in the presence of the emperor ? Surely not. But your presence is fine, because you're not the emperor. You guessed it. How did you guess ? It's simple. You're younger, and not by virtue of the waters of youth. You do not believe in the waters of youth ? Of course not, since I am the factory. So who are you ? - Me? - You. I am a baker. Matej Kotrba. You know what ? It would be well-advised to continue on. That's what I call a secret entrance, very convenient. This is my favorite. What do you want, little dog? You want the ball? They wanted to take it from you the whole time. Well, here it is. I wonder.. why they all wanted the ball ? - Who? - Lang and the other three. - They competed for this ball? - Like dogs. This is not a ball like others. When the Philistines competed for something, you can be sure that it has value. Well, it's Hebrew. Hamma ... Fora... Hammaforash. Hammaforash means nothing. But if he had written Shem-ha-mforash ... Then, it would mean something. - But that's it. - What? It's marked here : Shem-ha-m'forash. For heaven's sake. Read it again. Shem-ha-m'forash. - Word of honor? - Word of honor. So that's it. - If you read it right... - Of course. we'll see amazing things. Close your eyes. Stop ! What are you doing ? You're about to break everything. Not very clever to demolish things. Look what you did. You're not ashamed ? Well, never mind. This time I forgive you. But beware, if you do that again ! Kotrba. - He obeyed you. - He has to. The Golem always obeys he who animates it. By thunder, it heats like mad. Scott. Do you know the power that we have now? I'm aware. But also, they are aware. And they will kill us. -Let's get out of here. -No, we'll stay. I have spoken with Chamberlain Lang, and your baker will be executed tomorrow. - Why should he be executed? - The emperor has his reasons. But Kelley, we must do something. He must be saved. - You can do it. - Me? How? By liquidating the emperor. - But I cannot myself. - Sure you can. Without bloodshed, without dagger. By providing forms. Death loves a joke sometimes. It sometimes hides behind a blade of grass. Or ... ... inside the rose. The Emperor likes inhaling the smell the roses. A single breath ... and no more of the emperor. And Matej lives. So what do you say? You know what you did the last time ? You hit his majesty, the emperor ! This is not something to do, my dear. You're lucky that the Emperor loves you. But I love Matej. You must grant him his grace. Grace. Grace for Matej. It is a difficult thing. Only you can give it. - Me? - Yes. If you bestow your grace ... to me. As you wish, gracious Emperor. Now I am jealous of my own self. And what did he do, Matej, to deserve this ? That you're ready to be unfaithful to him, Katerina. Who told you my name ? You. And as I have a short memory, I made a knot. - But then, you're ... - Matej. So you agree? A good baker ? Matej. Quick, Matej ! They are on our trail. Where are you going? For the ball. Me too. What a coincidence ! Yes. Go ! Pull back from his majesty. You will have the goodness to give us the ball willingly. Where is the Shem ? Search him. Searching and questioning are useless. In the interest of civilization, I recommend a meeting in the torture chamber. Majesty, to save yourself ... inconvenience ... I ask you kindly for the last time... where is the Shem ? It's not worth wasting time. Bring in the executioner, that's all. You're crazy! We must extract the Shem without witnesses. -Heat the brand! - All right. But before it gets hot, you can try the rack. Now, majesty, you speak ? Or not ? Run, gather all men of good will! I'll catch up! Matej Kotrba will be tortured! Come to his aid! it won't start. You must first remove the nail. - Which? - That one. -This one? - Not that one, the other. - Yes, that one! - No, the other! But yes, that one. Rascal, what have you done? Me ... but since you said ... ... the small nail ... Don't fight. We are still allies. - Give me the Shem. - I know what I'm doing. Don't be a lunatic. I apologize. I'm still your friend.. - You can put your confidence in me. - So you say. - Did I ask your opinion? - Don't cry! And that's it. We are ... locked out. We must turn the crank. Hands off. Leave the Golem alone. Or it will cost you. Come on people ! Help Matej, quick ! Now, Golem, you have to protect me. Because both of us ... Not you two, Golem. But both of us. Only me. And you, Golem. My understanding ... and your strength ... Golem ! I'll put you in charge of a huge army! You'll win the greatest battles the world has ever seen! We'll fly ... from victory to victory ... battle to battle! Demolish ... Break ... ruin ... destroy ... Rule the world ! Golem ! What are you doing ? Stop ! Golem ! Golem ! Good people ! Do not panic ! Matej ! Death to the Golem ! Calm down ! Be reasonable. The Golem should not be destroyed. It would be a mistake. It can give us great service. I'll show you how. But first ... You see this ? We take a simple stroll, and come back to a mess. Who did this?! I'll explain everything. You, hold this. And if I am slow to return, come get me with the Golem. It starts here. We'll forgive you. But on one condition. You govern in our stead. It is impossible. Only occasionally, history hands us something. We might develop chemistry.. .. collect pictures, and you ... - Hold on! You know, this governing.. I'm not capable. But you too, you discredit it for history and for those who would succeed you. And people would end up understanding they would do better to govern themselves. Think about it. Or wlse we will deliver you to the executioner. And if I wake up Countess Strada ? She will ask you where you were. She doesn't know ? Not yet. Because she sleeps. Obviously, if you prefer to deliver me to the hangman ... So we will not give you to the executioner! Shut up and go! So I'm off. - But the Golem with me. - The Golem? Rudolph! Golem ! Go where you want with your Golem ! But what are you going to do ? It has too much energy. It depends on the head which controls this energy. The crowned heads, who have only money in mind, are ready to demolish the world for money. Rudolph! You don't hear me, Rudolph? What's going on here ? And why is master Kelley sleeping on the floor ? Rudolph, I tell you again, you are not a right emperor! Then do your best. And history does not discredit us. Don't push. You'll all see what you have never seen. Madam, sit back with this child. For your safety, this experiment is very dangerous. If the Golem stood, he would kill us all. Scotta, do not create panic. And he can't get out ? Matej says he cannot get detached. And if Matej says it, it's true. Vasku, Franto, Tondo, Pepiku. - Everything is ready? - Ready! People... finally ... that is to say.. What should I tell you ? If we succeed, as I say, if we succeed, the breads are fully baked for us all. For everyone. Don't be mad, Golem ! Forget the idea of destroying and demolishing once and for all. This is not what we want. - Do you want war? - No! You hear? What we want is to work in peace. And you can help us. Golem, come, be reasonable. - Master, it's hot! - It's hot! So, bake ! And you, good people, look, see that it's possible. It heats, we are right, we can be well, and we can have ... Makers of leather, money to buy shoes.. And roses in her hair, pants brand new... And oil for the machines, And machinery for work, And work without a struggle, After work, fun, And the sun in abundance for old, for young, and children in our joy, and joy for our children. Love the world. Love peace. And we'll all ... work for this world. If everyone puts his in, there will be bread and wine for everyone. END
