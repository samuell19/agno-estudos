I'm the influencer with sharp eyes and magic filled. Streaks in my hands are that of an ungovernable. I am... ...the influencer. Hey, what is it? Do not mess early morning. What is this? Does your father own the street? Your sharp eyes. I ran to my fullest. Instead of investing my time in thrashing you... ...I must invest it in bird watching. Ram Singh, it was our fault. Kindly, apologise. And hurry up. We have to go and pick up dad. I am the traveler... ...of my convenience. Will drown and go across. Cheenu it is. Purvi. Here you are after great bird watching. The girl in the car was really pretty, wasn't she? How do you know? I had gone to buy some milk. I thought to buy some snacks from uncle Cheenu's shop. And what do I get to see! - What? I saw someone bird watching. I like it. But I didn't do anything yet. I don't even know who she is. But I do know. - Really? Then do the honors. Please. No. - You won't tell me! Wait. Wow! Splendid! After so many days, climbing so many stairs... ...Saheb has come upstairs. Uncle, how are you? Fine? - Yes. Tell me. Tell me all her details. Only on one condition. I accept it. Tell me now. Look, if I pass out MBBS examination... ...then you owe me a wrist watch gift. Wrist watch? Done. Go on now. She's the daughter of the registrar. Mahek. Mahek! Mahek! Mahek (fragrance) spread all over me. What? Her name has actually made the ambiance... ...redolent, right? Don't began flying. Don't underestimate her. She's enough for many. Oh! But both of you will make a good pair. Because she is just like you. Vagabondage! Amazing! Vagabondage! In which college does Ms.Vagabondage study? She got expelled from the college. Then now? Do not worry. Her father will get her enrolled in your college. -Really? I have won the lottery. I can't stay here now. Hey! Don't forget, you owe me a wrist watch. Only if you pass out. Your milk is ready. Have it. Okay. Hey! Stop reading the feminists columns. At least invest time in cooking. Hey! You think this is feminists column! Home Minister Mr.Dalsukh is expected for the... ...inauguration in our neighboring school. Feminist columns! Ask your CM... ...that the temple is shut since years. Ask him to grace and inaugurate it. CM doesn't entertain people like us. Leave and let me do my arrangements. Arrangements! You'll build the alter. And arrange the chairs. And then? - Then what? All of them will be on stage and you'll be the audience. You are right. Dalsukh and I... ...joined the party together. He has become the Home Minister and I am still a welfare worker. No one entertains us on stage. - Me. Leave. There are many seniors out there who deserve it. You old generation! You can't think smartly. Do you want to be seated next to the CM? Leave now. - Don't challenge me. Don't challenge me. I can make this happen and in return... ...you'll buy me a bike. Done? What? If I make you sit next to the Home Minister... ...and if it gets published in the newspaper... ...in return, you'll buy me a bike. Done? Think about it. Don't laugh. I was anyway going to buy you a bike. But challenge will be a fun now. Mr.Registrar, you do not worry at all. Your daughter is like my own daughter. But be sure about the fees. You anyway charge millions. But to be honest. A child pass out graduate in our university in just Rs.12000. Sir, I can't hide it from you. We do own it all. It reaches the higher authorities. Right. I will do it. Anyway, education and politics go hand in hand. Call the student. Where is your daughter? She is sitting outside. She is sitting outside. Send her in, - Nice. She seems to be simple and generous. Absolutely. Pardon me but... ...such a girl in our college! She might be misfit. We have modern students here. So such a girl will not set here... She can. Can this girl set? Yes. Dad. I have got the admission. Can I leave? Yes. Go. - Thank you. Hurry up. I am thirsty. Hurry up. You are here since long. Hey! Help yourself from the canteen if you're in a hurry. It costs only Rs.20. You are fond of having from a bottle. Not me. What did you say? Whom did you abuse? Fool! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Come on fast. Hey! Why did you let him go? Malhar, he was one with attitude. You should have trashed him. Malhar! Malhar! Yes. - Why did you get trashed? The one to get trashed, gets the girl. Do not worry. And if you spare him... ...then you don't deserve your name. - Okay. Do not spare him. - Okay. Goddess will punish him. May she face the wrath. Malhar! Malhar, where are you heading? Did you reach? Yes. Reaching. Hurry up. Come on. Oh! Jayanti, you! - Yes. After years! I still remember the tea you make. - Thank you. How is it going? - By your grace. Welcome. Stay blessed. - Are everyone positioned well? Where are you? Home Minister has arrived. Everything is set. Wait. Is everything set? Done. - Yes. Tell me, how many of them are yet to arrive? Two corporators. Okay. You just occupy one of the two chairs... ...as soon as I tell you. Malhar, corporators are here. Get ready. One. Two, three. Come on. - Hey! Hang on. Don't you know driving? As if you know. - Wait. I will show you, get down. - Come here. Come here. - What is it? What is it? - Look here. Do not mess with me. - I'll trash you. I will trash you. Hey! - Sir. I am getting late. Hurry up. Hey! Just go and sit on the chair. That will help the students... ...of the school. Thank you. Move aside. - You keep quiet. Come on. - We are getting late. Sir, grace my shelter. It's really nice. Just as earlier. - It's CM calling. Coming, sir. I had to go. CM is calling. Just a photo please. So go on. One, two, three. Forceful companionship is possible but... ...not forceful happiness. We've to pen down a tribute. Go on. As you have left... ...party has incurred an unforgettable loss. Your sudden death... ...has traumatized me severely. May Lord... ...grant strength to face the grief. Oh! Mr.Mansukh. Live long, Mr.Mansukh. Yes. Hey! Do not worry. Government is responsible for your safety. My dear. You won't get a scratch. Okay. Bye. Write it. Mr.Mansukh. Sorry. Late Mr.Mansukh. I will miss you a lot. My sweet Lord! And yes, remember. Send this cover post 5 pm over-morrow. A tribute is meant to be given after the demise. What made you remind of me? I am lucky to have not faced such days yet. Politics is a really awful. We need to opt for all wrongdoings. Is everything set for Mr.Mansukh? Yes, sir. - Good. Where has the party fund raising reached? The industrial fund... ...is not enough. But if you don't mind... ...then we can manage with the liquor. I guarantee you the returns. No. With this step, the opposition will get a chance. Instead, do one thing. Grant permission to all the self-financed colleges. Right. To ask for money from the old colleges. They are earning good. - Sure, sir. And corporation by-election is round the corner. I am sure, you haven't thought of it. We must win that seat. Sir, I have just inaugurated a school today. Good. - Consider, we have won the seat. Then do add the youth in the rally. Sure, sir. I'll order all the workers today. And inform them. I am off. One has to die to witness the heaven. Salvation leads one to the heaven. Oh no! Oh! You hit me once and I hit you five times. It is settled. You should have trashed him in the college. Why did you put in so many efforts? My dear! His girlfriend was with him. If I had trashed him in her presence... ...he's be my enemy forever. Now, he is friends with us. Amazing! Actually, we both trashed each other. End of the story. Actually, we both trashed... ...each other. End of the story. Right. - Right. Here, darling. - Thank you. Hey. Where are you going? - I have brought water for Malhar. He's my friend. - Water for him! Girls are really magicians, right? She can make enemies friends. And vice versa. He got trashed yesterday and is serving me today. Water for you. Yesterday... - Let it be. Oh! - Chilled water for you. Chilled water. - Yes. Get lost now. Malhar, here she is. Come on. Hariya. - Yes. Mr.Hari. - Yes. Come running. Coming. Tell me. Transfer this water to another table. Here. Hariya. - Yes. Tell him, he must have the courage to... ...feed the same. I had gone to the river bank to fetch water. I have quenched my thirst... ...by your presence. The glass is half filled. Fill it half with some love. A boy... ...is no more in control. The bud has bloomed. Is no more in control. A girl... ...is really splendidly smart. Cuts and scales me. And yet gathers me every time. Here you are. Don't flirt. I am engaged a lot. There's no one here. If you concentrate on your career... ...this photo could replace by yours. My photo will be everywhere. But I won't have time to flirt then. I feel your presence everywhere in your absence. You play like music of love everywhere. I feel your presence everywhere in your absence. You play like music of love everywhere. You entice and placate me. And make me laugh. And get me trapped in sweet havoc. Different attraction and different drill. Something happens in the corner of heart. Different attraction and different drill. Something happens in the corner of heart. A girl... ...is really splendidly smart. Cuts and scales me. Yet gathers me every time. Different attraction. Different drill. Something happens in the corner of heart. Something happens in the corner of heart. Didn't I tell you. - What? That I am engaged. - I know. I am a volunteer. - Fool. Even I am a volunteer now. What? Oh! Smart. I know... ...what made you a volunteer. Come on. Both of us will close our eyes. - What? Do not miss the target. On the count of three. One. Two and three. Hey. Do not interfere. Will you interfere as you've got a package worth Rs.15,00,000? I'll see you later. Chandni! Good morning, sir. How can I help you? - Good morning. Be a good host. He intends to buy a mobile. - Bring it. Sir, of how many sim cards? His intellects are too low to understand this. How many sim cards? Fool! - Dual sim. Come on. It'll be fun. - Come on. This mobile is in demand. Okay. - And this is also the latest piece. You buy yourself a phone. I'll be there. Order 30 pieces of this model and tomorrow... -Excuse me. I have seen you somewhere. This is meant to be said to the girls. It doesn't suit us. Hello. I can't be wrong. I am sure, I have seen you. Do you click photographs fro identity proofs? Then you might have seen me. Bring the stock. - Sir, we have 10. This is the new stock. - Perfect. Hurry up. - Hang on. You are the one related to Rs.15,00,000 package. Rs.15,00,000. - Boss, MT college. Rs.15,00,000 package. Your poster was there and you study in the same college. What are you looking at? Count the stock. - Rs.15,00,000? There's so much to work. Check the I Phone consignment. - Okay, sir. Chintu, you be there. I'll be back. - Where are you heading? Hey! Malhar. - He fooled me. How are you? - Fine. What is wrong with you? Why are you following me? I am the same guy. But do not share this with anyone. But you had got Rs.15,00,000 package. Nonsense. I didn't get Rs.15,000. They committed a fraud in the name of placement. What? -The company hired me on a contract basis. They got me work like a donkey for six months... ...on probation period. And later fired me with the pretext of bad performance. Fired you! But that's how corporate world works. I am not the only one fired. Since last four years... ...all those who got hired through campus placement... ...almost everyone got fired from the company. I will... ...show you the Whatsapp group of those fired ones. Look at this. Fired. They asked me to resign after six months. They didn't pay me for last month. You should have protested the company. It didn't click out of job need. We did sign the contract. But it stated... ...they can terminate without reason. Thank you. We'll have to stop placement for this year. Is it fine? Change the contract. - Sure. Car, a foreign trip and a lot more. Wow, my contract! Are the changes fine? I have made it as you asked for. - Well done, guys. Just watch now. Now they have got trapped. Malhar, show us your moves. What is it? I am here. Show me your moves. Here. Leave now. Idiot. Hello, sir. - Hi. Welcome, Mr.Malhar. - Thank you. What are your hobbies? - To collect the information. I am known as Google in the college and Google has it all. What can you do for our company? - Everything. I mean, everything right from the peon till the CEO. What will you do if a tiger trespasses you? I will sign a contract with him and eat him later. Good one. Here are your contract papers. Sign them. You are hired. Oh! Thank you. Yes. You not have just given me this job, but a lot more. Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. - Excuse me. It is my key. So? - So, he owns the car. Right. - But I own it now. Didn't you read the contract? Read it. It is stated there. You will hand over car keys to me. A film with my girlfriend twice a week. Two foreign trip twice a year. And 30 percent partnership in your company. What do you mean? - Is it a joke? Who did that with you? I don't deserve your company. In fact, no student from our college... ...is worth your company. Thank you very much. What nonsense. What do you intend to say? Your turn over is about Rs.50,00,000. You have 40 employees. Sorry, you had them. You fired 10 of them 15 days ago. You didn't pay the rest for months. And terminated ex-students of my company... ...without paying them, right? Yes. - How does he know this? Google. I told you, I am Google. What nonsense? - Google. Google. - Are you mad? We've hiring you and you're being audacious. We're not interested in your fake jobs of your dummy company. You intend to hire free workers in the name of job. Yes. -You are fooling all of us. Yes. - Yes. You are paying Rs.10,000... ...instead of Rs.5,00,000 package. - What bullshit? Exactly. Your company is a bullshit. Good for nothing. We don't want it. Out. You are rusticated from this college. But ma'am, the company... - Shut up. I don't have time for your nonsense. Dad, what is it? Don't be tensed unnecessarily. Something will get managed. - What? Nonsense. They have rusticated you. I got you enrolled... ...in such a respected college and paid a huge amount. Not to do all this. That's my point, dad. There are no jobs despite of paying a huge amount. The trustees and the company are fooling together. They are all involved. Uncle. Malhar is right with his actions. At times, when unjust is being practiced in your presence... ...instead of keeping quiet, it's better to die. What are you saying? Hey! What are you saying? Be positive. And you! Instead of encouraging him to study... ...you are favoring him. And you! You will apologise the principal tomorrow. I don't want to listen anything. Here. Why should you write an apology letter? Is there any other option left for us? Otherwise his year will be in vain. Including the fees of whooping amount. But they run the college. We can't do anything. You are right. But you are running it. Sorry, guys. For interfering. I am a reporter. After years... ...I've come to cover as someone for the first time has... ...protested against the college. Malhar, my pal. It takes courage. Do not write an apology. - Right. Because if Malhar will apologise... ...then the matter will get closed. How will you seek the news? The world has large number of coward people. And those people know only one thing the best. To stop the courageous ones... ...from opting for the right things. What is expected to be done? Don't fear, make the college fear instead. Ask your fees back. They will pay us back but how will that help? That's the problem. Will you leave if they ask you so? You all don't question. Whereas you prepare a questionnaire to buy... ...a phone worth Rs.5000. Right? Then after you paying a whooping price of Rs.5,00,000... ...you don't question the college... ...about after paying such a huge amount... ...what will we gain? Will we get the job or not? If yes then how? Your fees is your power. The college might pay you back. But what if all the other students ask for it back? Let's do it. Yes. I have a great idea. - Which is? All of us will not get the fees back. But if we all... ...don't pay for upcoming semesters... ...then something is possible. Amazing! Brilliant! - College won't be able to... ...pay anyone if we don't pay fees. They will have to seal it. And this college holds... ...a lot of importance even politically. Because Home Minister... ...has invested in this college. And if this scandal gets revealed... ...then it will be no less than a havoc. So we all will not pay the fees. Right? - Yes. We will not. Students of MT college are on strike... ...since five days in order... ...to cancel Malhar Palladia's rustication. The important thing is, these students... ...denied to pay for the upcoming semester fees. The other self-financed colleges are petrified... ...that their students should not follow these steps. Vinita ma'am, act wisely. Sir, you do not worry at all. I will settle everything. Two days. All the students will get back to normal in two days. And I have expelled... ...the root of the problem. You didn't expelled the problem, but invited instead. Do one thing, cancel his rustication. But if we... - Nothing will happen. But if you don't, then it will be get into a scandal. Experience speaks. The black history of politics... ...is granted by such unsatisfied students. Cancel his rustication immediately. Everything will be fine. All the students will pay the fees. You know, elections are round the corner next year. Okay, sir. As you say. Sir, did you watch Aishwarya's new movie? You know, I have never watched movies alone. So let's go. - When is the next show? We'll have to reach within 30 minutes. Did you hear it? She has canceled Malhar's rustication. Malhar! Malhar! Malhar! The triumph of victory played. Warriors, wake up now. A conch plays.

'I am off.' 'Purvi.' You come to play... - Malhar. ...in the corner of my heart. You bring tears... ...to dry eyes. You are the color... ...of Holi (festival of colors) in my life. You are in the memories. You are the flying kite. You are in the... ...prayer of... ...my heart. You are in the... ...bounded compassion. 'At times, when unjust is being practiced in your presence...' '...instead of keeping quiet, it's better to die.' Kabira Mewada. Malhar Palladia. I don't want the degree. - Malhar. I don't want the degree from the system... ...that led Purvi commit suicide. Sir, education helps lead people a good life. But why are people dying out of the system? Sir, please. I ask justice... ...for Purvi and other students... ...like her. I don't want the degree... ...but justice. Enlightens us. No one will interfere. Awakens... Arrest him. ...the havoc within. Malhar. Come on. Someone else reminds me. Reminds me. After I meet you, I wonder... ...you remind me of someone else. Reminds me. How did you come? In police jeep. I mean, what are you in for? I scorched the degree in CM's presence in the college. Hey. I appreciate your daring. How did you come? - In an auto-rickshaw. See this. He scorched the degree. Informer. Police informer. You know what I mean. I am Rehmat. I have all the information... - With me. Come on, you are out on a bail. Come on. Open the door. Come on. - Not you. The other guy. Wow! You got behind the bars in college age. Now no one will mess with you outside. Sign here. You have got out on a bail for now. But don't get into anything. Otherwise you will lose your life. - Oh! You are threatening. Warning. You have messed with the CM. Have you lost it? Do not get influenced by these reporters. Otherwise you'll get destroyed. If I wish, I can get you in again. He is out on a bail right now. If he doesn't get out, you will get destroyed. Let's go, Saheb. Live long, Malhar! Live long, Malhar! This college student is getting viral a lot. We need to fix him before he opts to become a threat. Sir, you do not worry. Let some days pass by. We will fix him in such a way... ...that he will be quiet forever. Mr.Dalsukh, speak softly. Always be patient when having alcohol... ...and using politics. Sir, we can't help it. You know... ...that it takes no time for a spark to catch the fire. Get some water sprinkled in this sparkle. Sir, I can call a tanker. His father... ...is an old welfare worker. Give him the seat of a corporator. Wow! Wow! Wow! By your grace! Lower down the volume. Son. You scorched the degree but your father has graduated. What? - I mean... ...party has given me a ticked for next... ...corporation elections. - Dad. You know the fact... ...there are many seniors who deserves this. They all intend to stop me with this move. They are not obliged. - But... To douse the fire of my protest. Dad, try to understand. - You are right but... Just recall Purvi once. Malhar. This is not the time to get emotional. You will not stand for this election. I am a sure shot winner. So I will stand the election. Then get ready to get defeated. We will visit everyone and speak. No family should be unvisited. Transform the customs. Say it loud to the societies. They cannot take away... ...the voices now. Transform the customs. Say it loud to the societies. They cannot take away the voices now. I swear... ...by the sun. Will send back the night. And let the sun rise. I swear... ...by the sun. Will send back the night. And let the sun rise. A big event has occurred in the history of politics. The corporator of Sattadhari Lokmanas Party... ...Jayanti Palladia... ...lost the election from an impartial candidate by 3000 votes Malhar. - Hariya, you're here. Will you help me? Yes. Tell me. - My father headed to... ...clean the drainage and died out of it. Mr.Mansukh was about speak about it. But he too died out of an accident. Have you requested properly? - Yes. But I am still awaiting the response. Malhar, the government might hear you. I will do something. You do not worry. Something will happen. Do not worry. - Okay. A corporator might have won. But a father of a daughter is still defeated. Nothing but if I just become the voice... ...of those defeated ones is enough. Purvi. Dear. This is not our victory. This is the beginning of our war of justice. So not the victory celebration. But will held the candle march. Candle march. I swear... ...by the sun. Will send back the night. And let the sun rise. Time is the most... ...powerful. I swear by the sun. Filled with the courage. And fill the sky with our voices. That is the victory... ...of mankind. I read Purvi's letter everyday. And I always think that she didn't commit suicide. But has got murdered. The same way... ...as many students dreams gets murdered. You are right. Your responsibilities aren't fulfilled... ...just with the tag of corporator. Hang on. Hello. Yes. Are you serious? Okay. Thanks for the information. Bye. I had given Purvi's phone details to an expert. And he has found that... ...since last three days a college admin's... ...assistant used to call her. Will you say the truth or... ...go behind the bars out of Purvi's suicide case? Tell me. - Look. I am just an ordinary clerk. - Really? I have no knowledge about it. - Really? Before Purvi committed suicide... ...you were continuously calling her. Should I give details to the police? People whom you are helping right now... ...will not come for your bail. What will you do then? Then go to the jail. And your family will become homeless. Look... ...I should not get dragged anywhere. -Okay. In all the semesters... ...they fail students for mere marks and ask a whooping amount. I had called Purvi to ask for money... ...and all the amount goes to... ...Tribhovan. Saumitra. Who is Tribhovan? - I know that rascal. He is the party worker. He is fond of being with prominent politicians. Famously known as Tribhovan Batli. - Tribhovan Batli! Look. Let the bottle's bottom up. But our brotherhood should be unchanged. I follow a rule. I get ready... ...at 8 everyday. Tribhovan. You are a rich man now. You play with prominent people. People like me can't reach there. No. Keep mum. You are my brother. I can take you wherever you want. Tell me. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I will deliver two treasures the following day. Okay. Look... ...while having this foreign liquor... ...help my foreigner son. Oh yeah. - Yeah. He is my NRI friend's son. Oh! - He intends to invest in India. I have brought him to you... ...as you earn in billions now. No. That's not the case. He is an NRI. My NRI pal. - Oh, yeah. Pass me the cheese cube. Look. My earnings are like these cheese cubes. A huge amount of my earnings... ...goes to higher authorities. And all I get is this piece. Can't you get it all for yourself? Have you got 100 million? - By check or in cash? Open a self-financed college. I'll get you all the permissions. - Wow! But I'll charge 10 percent commission. - Sure. There's nothing to earn from a self-financed college. The government relies on that. Do you know, who had called just now? Education minister. In every 15 days... ...a whooping amount goes to... ...education minister. And... ...the transporter has become rich now out of the same. Are you serious? Yes. Thank you! Education minister seems dangerous. How can we invade his farm house? From the front gate. Malhar. There's tight security... ...where there's so much money kept. - Yeah. I know. No. How can we invade? Do you know how to ride a tempo? Do you know how to ride a tempo? Tribhovan sir has send the locker. Get it down. But some other driver comes every time. He is sick. That won't work. Get him online. Then you speak with him. - I will. Waste of time. Sir, someone has brought the locker. I have send it. It's mine. One's your sir's and another for Home Minister. Okay. I will get it. - Okay. Come on. I'm the influencer with sharp eyes and magic filled. Streaks in my hands are that of an ungovernable. I'm the influencer with sharp eyes and magic filled. Streaks in my hands are that of an ungovernable. I am the... ...influencer. Sharp eyes. And magic filled in eyes. Why did you come back? Sir, it got messed up. What happened? - They took the wrong locker. This has to be kept, not that one. Oh God! Come on. Yes, sir. What are you saying? We won. Captivate them. Come on. Get down. Leave me. - Hold him. Come on. Start the car. Hey! Leave him. Malhar! The heart has... ...called a war with wisdom. Can't find the solution. Whom should I agree with. But my heart says, this life... ...is about ups and downs. Rann it is. The prominent animal found here is Ghudkhur. If a human trespasses him... ...the other Ghudkhars... ...tears him into pieces. Then those Ghudkhurs... ...dies. Too bad. Remember. Not to trespass someone. Come on. - Ghudkhur has got Saurashtra. Only donkeys are the problem. - Sit. Straight forward answers. I like it. I wish you had wisdom... ...as much as you have words. You have 30 minutes. Stop all your acts. Otherwise I will bury you in this Rann. Or I will tie you on the camel... ...and send you across the border. You won't even get... ...death if you ask for. Nor could you survive. You are giving me 30 minutes. I give you 30 days. Within 30 days... ...I will demolish... ...your government. A wisdom has awakened. A conch plays. A wisdom has awakened. A conch plays. It awakens. It awakens. Oh, man. You seem to have watched South movies. Delivering dialogues when death is on your head. I don't understand if you are clever or stupid. If I go alive from here... ...then I am clever. And if something happens to me... ...it's your stupidity. Let me have some fun for being stupid. Pick him up. - Hey, mister. If I got damaged... ...then you'll incur loss worth 20 billion. If I don't reach my friends within 30 minutes... ...then the photos, videos and locations... ...worth 20 billions... ...will all be right in front of the media. That's a good try. Try again in your next life. 2nd floor, Bungalow 24, Harsukh Farm House... ...20 billion in the cupboard in bedroom. Till now, only I know. Within 30 minutes... ...whole world will know Education Minister's address. Look at Tribhovan's video, if you don't believe me. 'Here is 100 million.' 'Open a self-financed college.' 'I take responsibility for all the permissions.' 'But I'll charge 10% commission.' Water. 'Government depends on it.' Outweighed me. Outweighed me. The political profession outweighed me. We're talking about 20 billion. But... ...I will get... ...another chance to kill you. Take him. And drop him till home. Let the AC be high. Let him be cool. Okay? I'm going. You will go forever now. Remember. 30 days. Heart has gone naughty... ...being good. HM? Tribhovan Batlivala. He's killed, sir. But that boy... How are you? Good? - Yeah. 30 days? Are you kidding? Who do you think you are? Whatever happens, Government will go down. Who will do that? - Me Malhar! See. Action has started. Hello. Greetings. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. - Hi, thanks for coming. Hi. Our Honorable Chief Minister... ...doesn't have time for inauguration of this temple. Which is why it is closed since six months. That's it. I just want to tell Chief Minister... ...that even God will not wait for you. Brother is here. He is here. Brother is here. He is here. Brother is here. He is here. Saheb is here. He is here. Brother is here. He is here. Saheb is here. He is here. Brother is here. He is here. Saheb is here. He is here. Hail to Godless Parvati's Husband. Hail to Lord Mahadev. Hail. Roll camera. For justice of Purvi... ...and for the problem of students... ...I declare closure to all the colleges in the state. And now, will organize a student rally. Hail Mahadev! Why have you come? Saheb has declared closure for colleges. At this age, in native language... ...Saheb is called a Nag. Whoa, sir. Sir. Sir. You are the only sir. I want to kick you hard. But I won't. Stand up. Make sure that not even a single college gets closed. Sir, Guardian Board, Student Board... ...Board of Trustees has been informed. And Police will be very strict. Good. Tell State IB... ...to keep an eye on Malhar. Where he goes, whom he meets, what he does. I want details of every minute. Malhar you called me? - See. I am sending this map now. Our rally will go from here first. Then on the main road. - Okay. And then on this street. Okay? - Okay. I'm forwarding this. You pass on others. I'm going for rally's permission. I'll send it to every student. - Malhar! Very few colleges are closed. And the Government workers are opening the closed ones. Government's applies on their workers... ...not on the students. Which is why I organized students rally. Malhar? - Yes? Aren't you hurrying? How will so many students will come in your rally? They will. From everywhere. Hostel... ...library, colleges. And everyone is with me. I will rock it. Not everyone, Malhar. Only youth is with you. There is difference between... ...real followers and Instagram and Facebook followers. There is no time for this. This time is for this action. Look, Malhar. Whatever you do next... ...just think of it a hundred times. Because all who are with you today... ...could be against you tomorrow. Malhar. I'm going to Government hospital since five months. No one is investigating for my father. They are telling me to bring the documents. Now, you do something. Look, I'm in a hurry. I will do your work for sure. 100%. Start giving your documents. But.. Let her pass. Someone stop this girl. We'll have fun. Leave it! Leave it! Run! Run! Get out from here. Get out of here! Run. Let's get out of here. Let's go. Let's get it. - Go behind him. Catch him. Malhar and his supporters answer less behaviour. This is Malhar's hooliganism. Will Malhar take responsibility for this? People's anger on Malhar is growing up. Saumitra! We have to go to police station fast. Students who were supporting... ...cops arrested them. We have to bail them. Their parents are pressurizing me. They are arrested... ...because they made a mistake. They were in rally because of us. Us? Because of you. It's all similar. - No. You don't want to fight. You want to be a hero. From now on, do not expect anything from me. Is there a problem if they listen to me and agree with me. Or you don't like me being famous. - No. I don't like it. Because people have hopes from you. And you don't even know that. Do you intend to come with me to the police station or no? Saumitra? After all these years? Now I understand from where this boy... ...got so much influenced air. Then let's finish the air pump. No. Kill this boy. Kill this boy mentally. Go on. Look, sir. They are students. Does it mean, they can do anything? Sorry, sir. They made a mistake. Yes, they did. If someone like you calls for a rally... ...one should not go. They should know this. Sir, this will not happen again. That's why they are in there. You can't keep them here like this. Keep them aside. First, you get out of here. Out! Get out! Hey, go inside. My children are behind the bars! You know what you did? Look at us. What did our kids do... ...that they are arrested because of you? You should be ashamed. What are you looking at me? Look at us. Brother is here. Saheb is here. Brother is here. Saheb is here. Brother is here. Saheb is here. Brother is here. Brother is here. Saheb is here. Hey! Hey! Brother is here. Saheb is here. Brother is here. Saheb is here. Yes, mom. - Son? Come home. Quick. Come home. In our home... - What? No, no. I'm coming right now. I'll be there. What thugs? Did they hit you? They hit dad? Is he injured? Where are you? - Don't worry. I'm coming, mom. Malhar is also with me. We are... - Don't bring him with you. Yes. Don't bring Malhar with you. And from now don't even meet him. Listen. Thugs were in the house. They hit my parents and messed the house. I have to go. Listen, - Let's go. Let's go. Come here. Come here. Listen. Mom told me not to take you there. She has also asked me to stay away from you. Smile. You received a revenge... ...for what you did. Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! The lips that can pray... ...together they can... ...also create eroticism. Amazing! Amazing! Hey. - Yes, sir. Do something to entertain people. Malhar? Sorry. This video... - Where were you? I saw this video. I don't know... I know. Not bad, huh? Malhar, I know. Why are you worrying? And what's this? Where were you? Don't worry. How dare you come here? Get out. - Daddy? Daddy! Shut up. Not a single word. Are you not satisfied by disgracing us? I'll file a case against you. Ant trust me, you will be in prison. Then I'll also go in the jail. Not only Malhar kissed me. I kissed him too. And I will. - Mahek? You are not getting it. But, dad... - You should forget him. He'll do nothing in future. Trust me. This stupid is influenced by Saumitra. You don't know Saumitra. Saumitra is the one... ...who killed his loved ones. He cheated on him. And that Saumitra... ...will kill him. - One minute. What did Saumitra do? Why are you asking me? Ask him. You come with me. Understand what I say. - Daddy. Daddy... Come with me. - Daddy... Saumitra is treacherous. - But, daddy... And I think, to kill him... ...Saumitra viraled this video. Saumitra is treacherous. 'Saumitra has viraled this video.' 'Saumitra is treacherous.' 'Saumitra has viraled this video.' 'Saumitra is treacherous.' You'll be happy killing me? You go. Come back when you are calm. - Why? Are you afraid to hear the truth? - I'm afraid to say the truth. Then run away! Just like... ...how years ago... ...you ran after cheating on your men. Just like that. What is this place? This is my office. Office? - Where I too dreamt... ...of changing something. And I am still having the pain of not fulfilling it. 'Is everything alright, Mr.Diwakar?' - Me and Sachin. Who is CM now. We both were sincere students of Mr.Diwakar. You and CM together? - Yes. Sachin wanted to enter the system very fast. And I wanted to change the system. 'Saumitra!' Sachin had the passion to enter into politics. For that he could go to any limits. 'Yes, Sachin. Have a seat.' 'Saumitra, look...' 'Poor people, farmers, students...' '...raised Rs.3,00,000 as a fund for our party.' 'What? - Yes. Take this.' 'You keep this. - Okay. As you say.' I didn't understand Sachin's game. Have ever shouldered the burden of a dead body? I did. 'Mr.Diwakar?' 'Mr.Diwakar! - Move.' 'Mr.Diwakar committed suicide because of you.' 'You got involved with the government?' 'He is a traitor. - What are you saying, Sachin?' 'What am I saying?' 'See this. By taking money from Government...' '...he dealt us.' 'Mr.Diwakar was so upset on you for this.' 'You gave this money to me, saying...' '...that our party raised this fund.' 'Okay. You got caught...' '...which is why you are blaming on me. You are a traitor.' 'He is a traitor.' 'Saumitra, what you did, is called cheating.' 'Do not come here ever again. Understand?' 'You are out of here. - Get out! Get out!' 'He is a traitor. - He is a traitor.' 'Get him out of here. - Come on, Get out!' 'Get out of here. - Get him out of here' 'Get him out of here. - Go away from here.' 'Blacken his face. Blacken his face.' Sachin sacrificed Mr.Diwakar and became the CM. Saumitra... ...I'm sorry. When I saw you for the first time... ...I thought you can stand against CM. I am surrounded by many questions right now. I feel like quitting and escaping from here. Hello. Change... ...the customs. Tell... ...the societies. They cannot take away the voices now. Change... ...the customs Tell the societies... They cannot take away the voices now. I swear... ...by the sun. Will send back the night. And let the sun rise. Saumitra. Today I understood... ...what is it to shoulder a burden of a dead body. But, did you see? You are not alone in this fight. These laborers, farmers... ...these women. They all are fighting against Government's injustice. You take all of them with you. Government is afraid of only one thing. And that is aware public. Dilip Desai. I'm from the opposition party. I'm with you in this fight. Fight for your war in the Assembly. We'll fight our way. No need of you. I swear by the sun. Will send back the night. And let the sun rise. This is Hari. What did he ask for? Justice for his late father. He stood alone because he had the courage. And did what he said. Hari, who had fire in him... ...he is on fire today. Hari has turned black. He is not Hari. This is our State. Little bit black, tired, half burned... ...by the leader's greed, betrayal, tricks. We may not have so much courage compared to Hari. But from within, we are all on fire. Just like Hari. We also have sparks inside us. If these sparks gathers... ...then it won't take time to take the Government down. Now fire of Hari's pyre... ...will cool down, when the Government goes down. I swear by the sun. Will send back the night. And let the sun rise. From today, no one will... ...pick up garbage from Government worker's houses. Put all your garbage in front of their houses. They will understand when... ...they will suffer from all this. Then they will understand. Yes. Yes. It is Saheb on line. Yes, Saheb. Yes, yes. Yes? Okay, then. Why is this garbage here? Cleaners are on strike. Your houses will be cleaned... ...when politics will get cleaned. Clean the walls. The breath... The farmers are also forced to come... ...at the Assembly for their demands. The voices against government is witnessed everywhere in the state. Cleaners were also on strike till now. And opposition corporator stood trying for... ...her daughter's justice. I swear by the sun. Will send back the night. And let the sun rise. We want justice. We want justice. Do you think, you'll get justice for Purvi? Definitely. I definitely believe that... ...Purvi will get justice. I saw your news. I appreciate your coverage. - Thank you so much, sir. Shall I send my camera team to have a byte? No, no. Look. People gain trust by votes. I do it by talks. Order, sir. - Do one thing. Yes. - Arrange a debate with Saheb. Okay, sir. - People must learn... ...that there is no other branch... ...of the original Saheb. Okay? - Done, sir.

We heard that you're quite flying in the air. I mean, you use government helicopter for... ...personal use. Is it true? - Mr.Reporter. Where have you gone to with your family yesterday? To Bhavnagar for sister-in-law's marriage. With office vehicle. Pal, car and helicopters are machines. We must keep using it or it might get damaged. Sir, how about education getting expensive?

As the streets are too good. I couldn't ride more than 40. Sir, you accomplish many tasks. Then look after the streets too. You are heading on the wrong street, pal. And also influencing the youth.

He made it a 24 seconds video! Thank you. Thank you for showing my clip. Now see this too. 'In every 15 days...' '...a whooping amount goes to...' '...education minister's farmhouse.' 'The government relies on that.' Now you tell me. To love someone is shamelessness? Or to compel someone to commit suicide is shamelessness? You tell me. To kiss in public is shamelessness? Or to get someone killed is shamelessness? Mr.Harsukh, Mr.Mansukh. Hari, Tribhuvan, Purvi. Sir, the list is too long. You tell me. Who is shameless? And what is called shamelessness? Yes.

I will tell you then. Do not step back then. Have you ever been to Dang district? Yes, sir. By God's grace. I think, you need you to visit once again. Residing in this city... ...your energy has gone into vain. No, sir. This is not the case. So before the youth make me quit politics and send to Dang... ...I will get you transferred to Dang. Then the nature will entertain you. With the tribes. - No, sir. Sir. Sir. Sir, don't get me transferred. Speak with him. - Then fix this boy. Bury him, throw him in to the well, drown him. Do whatever it takes. Okay? - Okay, sir. Right, sir? - Yes. And if you can't do it... ...then Dang is for you. Enjoy. - Go. Here he is. Stop him. Hey, stop. - What is it? Get down.

At least you got some days rest because of the cops. Because of whom? - The cops. I will not spare the cops. Sir, did you get hurt? - Come. Those were the cops. If I don't get you suspended... ...then I don't deserve my name. Saumitra, calm down. I asked them to hit me. Vandalism. But why? Because CM has ordered the cops... ...to kill Malhar. Be grateful to these honest cops who informed me. If they hadn't hit me... ...then my corpse would have been buried somewhere. I am safe here because of them. Here. - Hey. This was not needed. Keep it. Accept it when cops give you. Malhar, we'll leave. Okay. - Go. You have begun playing tricks like political leaders. Hey! - Sorry. You are clever now. - Of course. Would you like some juice? Quiet. You are good for nothing. I had made all the arrangements but he made a quick move. Sir, now... ...it's risky to kill him. And you will get accused if anything happens to him. And subjects are anyway agitated. Subjects are agitated? Subjects are agitated! Then agitate them more. Sir, they will not spare us. Not against us. But against each other. Rehmat. - Yes. Do me a favor. For Rs.2000. Be there at 11. Oh! But what do I have to do? - Hey. Nothing. We have to create some riots with them. And some petrol bombs. I've spoke with them too. They too will do the same with us. Create riots. It is all set. Be there at 11. Take a turn. Turn. - Right. Yes, Rehmat. - Malhar. They have planned to... ...agitate Hindu-Muslim riots in name of your campaign. CM has bribed them... ...and set people of both the communities. You! Do you know their children? King Rama, descendant of Raghu clan. -Go. Ram and Seeta uplift the downtrodden. King Rama, descendant of Raghu clan. Ram and Seeta uplift the downtrodden. Ram and Seeta! Ram and Seeta!

King Rama, descendant of Raghu clan. Ram and Seeta uplift the downtrodden. Look. Right now, government has 112 MLA's. If the government intends to win by majority... ...then he must have 94 MLA's. If he misses out even one MLA... ...then the government will go down. Okay. If 19 MLA's does not support government... ...then government will lose it and goes down. - Correct. King Rama, descendant of Raghu clan. Ram and Seeta uplift the downtrodden. King Rama, descendant of Raghu clan. Ram and Seeta uplift the downtrodden. Ishwar and Allah are both same. Our government is so good at work... ...that the opposition has nothing to do... ...except reciting hymns. You have played the Hindu-Muslim card. Lies. - Lies. It is lies. Poor... ...farmers, laborers, students are all agitated on you. You have lost the moral right to be in the politics. We will approach the governor... ...and claim this government... ...untrustworthy.

There' no water supply... ...and I've applied face pack. Get water and electricity supply in all the houses. -Sir. We are cops. Not a plumber or an electrician. No one is proving my family with household groceries. Sir, my family couldn't get out even while covered. Sir, our family is important. If our families are safe... ...then we will fight and win the elections once again. For now, here is my resignation. Mine too. Sir, a call from Delhi. Yes, sir. No. Everything is all right. Okay. HM. No MLA should not leave now. The matter has reached the high command. So here is the breaking news once again. The political situation in the state... ...has faced another trouble. 11 MLA's have resigned. CM has got an order from Delhi. Mr.Mansukh's death mystery will soon get solved... ...sources as per CBI. So with this, here ends today's news. This is subjects power. The subjects who can elect the MLA... ...can compel... ...them to quit in no time. 11 MLA's have resigned. And 101 MLA's are still left. If we deduct eight, there won't be any majority. One down. Suddenly? Normally, a father jacks for their children. But we are here for our fathers. What? - Our fathers intends to work with you. Will you approve them? But who are they? We have done a lot of wrongdoings. Till now, we did everything for our children. We perceived... ...that our children should be like us. But you are their role model. And so we are with you. You are not with me. But with state's subjects. Yes. - Yes. Dad, uncle. Malhar has hired you. It calls for a selfie now. Sir, four MLA's are with Malhar. Which means 97 in total. If we add these two... ...then five more than majority. HM. The people in Th selfie... ...should not reach Vidhan Sabha to vote. Position our police and other men. They should not reach. And we will automatically win. Wow! This might be the first event in the country... ...where the youth has shattered the government with majority votes. To Vidhan Sabha. - Sure. Not even films has such suspense. In today's contest, you have to answer... ...will Malhar take down the government? Sir, what do you think? Will Malhar succeed? Not so easily. This is all official in overseas. Should I call the radio guy? Yes. Dial him. So, I await your quick answers. Mulji speaking. - Yes. I bet, Malhar will win. He will win. Let us begin for motion of no confidence voting. The game has begun. Voting has begun. But Malhar and some MLA's are missing. It digits are increasing. And government is getting stronger with every vote. Hold them. Has Malhar accepted his defeat? It seems as the state subjects... ...expectations has once again... ...gone in vain. Last 15 minutes for voting. But there's no update about Malhar yet. Hit them. Hit them. - Hit them. Hit them. - Run. Save us. - Leave us. Save us. - Leave us. Save us. - Leave us. Save us. - Leave us. Save us. - Leave us. Save us. - Leave us. Breaking news. Malhar Palladia and MLA's... ...have reached Vidhan Sabha in injured state. -Hurry up. Hurry up. - Take a close up. Injured state! - Saumitra. They have reached the Vidhan Sabha. Sir, hang on. Sir, hang on. - Later. Later. Let us see... ...how much blood will this motion of no confidence ask for? Hello. - How are you? The way was too long. But we finally reached the destination. But government still has five votes of MLA's. And government will not get defeated. 'You are gone.' 'He is right.' 'Here is CM's statement.' 'CM has mentioned you being responsible...' '...for Mr.Mansukh's death.' 'Whenever he faces tough times...' '...he slaughters his closest one first.' 'You know the history.' 'You will have to help us in taking down government.' 'You and some more MLA's...' '...will vote against the government.' 'Because if the government wins...' '...you will die.' As per the sources... ...voting has concluded. Let us see, if government could survive in... ...motion of no confidence. Whether we win or lose. We have fought well. Right. And... ...subjects are awakened too. That's the actual victory. The votes have been counted. Government has got 90 votes. Whereas 94 against the government. Government could not prove their majority. And so with the immediate effect, government gets discarded. We won! Brother is here. He is here. He is here. My Saheb is here. Brother is here. Whoa! This boy defeated us in our game. He defeated you. Stop the car. You intended to strangle me. I have cut your wings. I have provided all the evidences... ...of yours against Mr.Mansukh's death. Bye. Congratulations! Malhar, this is your victory. You are our new CM. CM! CM! CM! CM! CM! CM! I feel, to take down government is easier... ...than delivering a speech. But remember. The campaign does not... ...stop by defeating the government. It's not necessary that every campaign has a politician in it. Not all the campaigns are meant for political career. But for transformation. And my protest... ...is not against any particular party. But is against the entire system. And so... ...at this moment... ...I reject the CM seat. I am just a student leader. The college campus bench needs me. Because there... ...the students who sits next to me... ...are common man. Common man means CM. It is more than enough... ...if no follows Purvi or Hari's footsteps. Your party will govern now. Remember one thing. It's a warning. If you choose political benefits... ...over subjects... ...then Sahebs will merge from all the colleges once again. And get down your government. Remember the name. Saheb. The triumph of victory played. Warriors, wake up now. A conch plays. A wisdom has awakened. Awakens the havoc within. Reminds of the forgotten conscience. Lights up. Enlightens us. A conch plays. A wisdom has awakened. A conch plays. A wisdom has awakened. Awakens the havoc within. Reminds of the forgotten conscience. Lights up. Enlightens us. Lights up.
