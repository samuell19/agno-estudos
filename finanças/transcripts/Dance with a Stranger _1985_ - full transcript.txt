Is it that bloody woman again? She's pregnant. [ David ] you and Carol are the best friends I have. I don't want to quarrel with you. So long as you're involved with that Woman, you'll be quarreling with everybody. [ anthony ] it could be cussen's Kid. Use your common sense, David. You're not stupid enough to let her fool You with the oldest trick in the book. - [ David ] she's had a rough life. - We've all had rough lives. If you marry her, she'll drag you down To her level because she's incapable... Of rising to yours. You've only got to look at Her. I like the way she looks. What should I do? [ anthony ] look... You've entered the Emperor at oulton in April. Worry about that, not her. I thought I'd either find you in Here drinking yourself stiff... Or hiding up your nanny's skirt at the Ancestral home, you gutless cretin ! You thought you were safe in here, Surrounded by all these toffee-nosed twats... Who think the sun shines Out of your porthole. I suppose they're all under The false impression... You've got a shred of decency in your body. You cowardly, treacherous, Two-faced mockery of a man. If you don't want to have Anything to do with me, I wish you had the nerve To say it to my face. Then I wouldn't be so ashamed of ever Having had anything to do with you. I'm sorry about this. [ Man ] who's with this lady? You only care about number One. Let me get her out of here. [ Ruth ] when you're in trouble, you Expect the whole world to rally 'round. You turn my stomach ! Everything about you stinks Of hypocrisy and fear ! I don't know which smells The most disgusting ! You're devoted to her, aren't you, Desmond? You bring her all this way just So she can make a fool of herself. You know what you'll be doing next? You'll Be making her dresses, bleaching her hair. For now, you chauffeured her Here.

[ Ruth gasping ] [ engine accelerating ] [ engine whining, thumping ] Oh... Thank god he's all right. I completely forgot he was coming home. I was so involved with georgina, I missed the train back. How is she? She's beautiful, des. I could Hardly bear to leave her. You're a liar, Ruth. Andy's headmaster phoned your landlady... To find out what's happening To him in the holidays. And she phoned me because, As far as she knew, You and your husband, Mr. Ellis, had gone to the races. I'm sorry. Why in christ's name Doesn't he leave you alone? He's only interested in himself. He Doesn't give a damn about anyone else. What about andy? Hmm? He'd have been alone all Night if I hadn't been here. Doesn't Blakely think About things like that? A child alone all night? The whole thing's filthy. He's treating you as though you were a tart. A kid's left to fend for himself. It isn't right. When David asked me to watch The emperor race, I just went. Nothing else mattered? No. Not even your son? I forgot. I'm sick of seeing you on your knees... To someone who treats you like dirt. Has he been hitting you again? I don't know. Surely even you must know When someone's beating you. Please, don't. You look like a ghost. Where will andria sleep? I've arranged for a camp bed... With the landlady. I feel like my brain's Trying to jump out of my head. [ gasps ] [ gasps ] [ knocking ] [ David ] are you all right now? I'm still bleeding. Otherwise, I'm as fit as a fiddle. Why are you here? You've been trying to get hold Of me all week, haven't you? So your friends did tell you I phoned. Yes. But you didn't try and call me back. Well... I was busy. I'm sorry about the baby. Weren't you interested in knowing how I was? I didn't like thinking about it. Was it a boy or a girl? I don't like talking about it. I'll wait until my Tranquilizers start working. Why are you taking Tranquilizers? To calm me down. I've been asked to drive for the Bristol team at le mans this year. Is that good? [ laughs ] It means I've hit the jackpot as a driver. This is the official team photograph. I got one for you and one for my mother. You should have seen their Faces at home when I told them. All of a sudden, they've Got to take me seriously. You've got to come to France with me. After the race, we could have a holiday. You've never been abroad, have you? What will you do with the emperor? It's not important now.

All right. Would you like to go to the fair Tomorrow afternoon? Yes, please. What time? [ David ] um... Half past 3:00. I'll pick you up later. [ door opens, closes ] Still engaged?

There was no need to upset Him. [ Desmond laughs ] Being upset is nothing new to andy. Bad enough David let him down Without you going on at him. So now I'm as rotten as Blakely. Of course not. Oh, but I am, Ruth. I could be worse than both of You put together if I let myself. You'd think more of me then, wouldn't you? No. Yes. Yes. No. [ struggling, shrieks ] get off me ! If I'd treated you like a Punch bag instead of a woman... You would have thought that baby you Lost was mine instead of Blakely's. It could have been mine. [ sighs ] Yes. [ laughs ] Ruth.
