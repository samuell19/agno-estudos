Hurry. Hurry up. -Go. -1, 2, 3 Again, go again. 1, 2, 3 Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain The pickups are here too. Only the ones outside are left. So there’s three. Sit. No, just two ... the other bus left. Come here. -They’ll all fit in two. -Wait. -So? -There’s two left. Are you done? Who’s over there now? Garousi’s there. Pay attention. Don’t take the wing four convicts without handcuffs. It’s okay if there isn’t enough for the rest. You guys go on ahead. We’ll leave in an hour. -Seyyed Davood will come with me. -Yes sir. It’s blank. After the accident last year, my hand is too weak. Open it. Open it. Fine. We’ll make it two weeks. Two weeks bonus with ten toomans. We’ll give you as many workers as you need. Sit. But you have to deliver in two weeks. Just like the old one. Write a list so I can have them buy everything you need. You were supposed to leave the speakers till last. I can’t! Blessing will leave my life. I’ll be cursed by people’s families! Please! I’ll make you as many doors and windows as you want. For free! I don’t even want any time off. Just relieve me from this one. People’s families? -You think those that get hanged are people? -I’m not God. How should I know? Maybe one out of a hundred isn’t guilty. -Will you take responsibility? -Fine. Please relieve me! Sir, we managed to detach the base. Record Seyyed Davood’s two bits of opium from last year. -Do it now. -Please don’t! -I built you so many things over the years! -Make it one bit. -Please sir! -Sir, the guard said they’re still at the gate. What? Half the prisoners here have leather necklaces. -Take one and give it to them and get it done. -They say there was a golden prayer inside. -When did they receive the corpse? -Two days ago. I asked the social worker too but she doesn’t now. -Is the doctor still around? -He was packing. I’ll build it. I’ll give you a list by tomorrow. Just make sure no one in the wing finds out. No one will know. Go pack and leave with the last bus. Vahdat? We’re not buying anything this month. -Will you run out? -No, we still have some. Was there a pendant on the prisoner who was executed two days ago? I don’t remember. What happened? Get up. Good. Stand up. Stand. Walk. Good boy. That’s that. You can leave now. Make sure he’s not left behind. Hurry up and pack. The buses are leaving. The pickup’s back. I’ve told the workers to pack the things up here too. -How many of us are left? -You and I ... nine all together. Eat something. You haven’t had anything since last night. -Sergeant? -What is it Asaadi? Sir, Colonel Modaber is here. He’s coming in. Get some tea. They’re waiting. When will you deliver? It’s been evacuated already. This is the only place left. -They can start in two hours. -I’m leaving for Tehran next week. Deputy general director? Congratulations! Answer that. I’d told you. Who do you think they’ve put in my place? -Colonel Seyyedi? -Nope. Colonel Rahnema was transferred. Excuse me sir. Officer Rauf is on the line. -He says it’s urgent. -See what he wants ... -So that leaves Sarmad. -The officer can’t speak now. Hello? Hello? Sir? You’re kidding sir! They wouldn’t do it at first. They said your rank is not high enough for Chief Constable. I spoke with the General and said someone who’s managed this prison so well for so many years can easily handle being Chief Constable. Hand off this doghouse. You need to come over there next week. They’ll promote you so your rank won’t cause bureaucratic problems. What’re we gonna have with our tea? Sweets! Sergeant! Where are the sweets? Did I put them here? I am really grateful. I don’t know what to say. I hope to be able to repay you. Sergeant! Sweets! I’ll be right back. Hurry up and hang up. Sweets! Hang on a minute ... The officer says during headcount one of the prisoners was missing. Hello, Rauf? What’s going on? Are you sure? When did you find out? What have you done! From which wing? Come back right away, with the officers and bus drivers. Right away! Major! I swear we did everything you said. We didn’t have any problems. I don’t understand ... He can’t have gone far. We’ll find him if we leave now. What was his sentence? Apparently fifteen years. I’ve asked them to get his file. We’ll catch him if you give us a couple of hours. Well? I stayed in the bus. A prisoner went out with a soldier, threw up and got back in. -The doors were shut. Is that right? -Yes. It didn’t even take two minutes. What else? We stopped for a few seconds too, but no one got out. The car in front of us broke down. Our delivery list was complete sir. It was just a short halt, not even a stop. I picked up forty-three, and delivered forty-three. We did too. There may have been a mistake in the count. Maybe... There can’t be a mistake. I counted them ten times. -Did you take a full count of the incoming? -There was no need for that. We’ll do it if you want. We were adding the wings when we noticed the third wing was missing one. -What about the exit count? -That was correct. Counting Seyyed Davood who’s still here, it’s 832 ... -Seyyed Davood isn’t here! -You said you’d bring him yourself. He’s right. Seyyed Davood’s in the new prison. I saw him there. I sent him on the last bus. -I thought he was done here. -Wait a second. So your exit count was 831 instead of 832? Yes, because Seyyed Davood was supposed to come with you, so I thought 831 was right. But if Seyyed Davood’s already there ... -Does the main gate have a guard? -Yes Asaadi’s there. -Return the watchtower guards to their posts. -Yes sir. -So what’s going on? -He’s still here. Return with these men. No one must find out. Should I ask his social worker to come? Naji, pick a couple of guys and begin searching from upstairs, inch by inch. Yes sir. Go on, why’re you waiting. Where was his cell? Number five in the third wing. The small one. The main gate is locked. The guards are in the watchtowers. We know you’re here. You can’t get out. If you come out in the yard in the next five minutes and stop wasting our time, we’ll pretend nothing’s happened and head over to the other side together. All the doors are open. Your five minutes begin now. So. They attach the pictures with pins, so they detach easily. This wouldn’t happen if they used tape. They threw these all in here. I can’t find his picture in his files. It’s not important. He has a long skinny face with bright eyes. They call him Ahmad Redskin because his skin is always red. He’s tall and thin ... Ahmad Seif, born in 1932, that makes him ... Thirty-five-years-old. Yes. He’s from one of the surrounding villages, Karim Abad. It says he’s a farmer, but they took away his land a few years ago, so he was a drifter in the city. He is married and has a young daughter. That’s it. This is all you may find useful. In general he’s a quiet person. He always carries a frog around too. I don’t know where he found it. And his sentence is for three weeks from now ... What? The 25th of next month. What sentence? Wasn’t he serving his sentence? He was, but his conviction changed three weeks ago. First he was given fifteen years, but got first-degree in appeals court and will be executed. -Is it definite? -Yes. Naji, come up here! Hurry. We made an appeal but it was denied. Something’s wrong with his file, the sudden change didn’t make sense. -I wrote you a letter too... -Hello? Send over three guards, now. No send five. Send the prisoner’s cellmates too. I want the prison plans too. The old ones that were in storage. Send it all. Send Teymoor over before anything else. Hurry, I’m waiting. Send someone to the fire station. Tell them we need their search dog. Exit guards, pay attention. No one leaves this compound without my knowledge. -What about downstairs? -We searched the basement. -They’re searching the laundry room. Afterwards... -Get going. -Shut all the doors. -Yes sir. I repeat, no one leaves this compound without my knowledge. Has he escaped? He’s right here ... hiding somewhere. We’ll find him. Major, there’s something I wanted to tell you. I did some research on his file. I understand your position too. I believe he’s been framed ... they accused him of killing a landowner. But he wasn’t involved at all. They wanted to take away his land and he wouldn’t let them. He stood up to the village chief. I wrote many letters asking them to at least delay his execution. But I couldn’t do anything because of the village chief. His lawyer’s given up too. I have no doubt he is innocent. He doesn’t have anyone to look after his case. I did everything I could for him. -Akbari, what’s going on? -We’ve searched upstairs. He’s not there. Executing him is not justice. For me justice is to find him and throw him in his cell ... the rest of it is not my concern ... come, let me show you one of these animals. Have you gone mute? Go on, it’s ok. Two weeks ago ... I’m listening. Two weeks ago he ordered four cans of shoe polish. I didn’t know, otherwise I’d have said something sooner. I figured it out just now when the Sergeant asked. -Who brought it for him? -I don’t know. I swear I didn’t know anything, or I would’ve told you. He never talked to anyone. He minded his own business. What else? That’s it. Get out. Sir, my daughter is sick, can I get a few days off? -Fill out a form. -Thank you sir. Do you have a pencil? Yes. Why did he want shoe polish? We’ll find out. I think you’re not as severe as the social workers say. I can send you all to the port because of this. -Sergeant, write up the report. -It’s not ours. Ahmad Redskin dug it. He filled it with water for his frog. -When was the last time you saw him? -After we packed our things in the morning Saleem and I went out the cell, and didn’t see him again. -What about you? -We were together. We came out and he stayed here with him. So? I can’t remember anything. If you don’t remember I will send you to Bandar Abbas right now. -No problem bro! -Mr. Mosayeb, you’ll surely remember if you think a bit. If you want me to, I may remember something. After they left, the wing officer took Ahmad and me to the boiler room. Afterwards I didn’t see Ahmad again. You won’t find Ahmad Redskin. He blew away like smoke. These animals sure listen to you! Let me see your hand. It’s nothing. The more I think about it, I realize I should’ve punished the guy who did this to you before sending him to exile. I didn’t want you to send him to exile. I told the Sergeant a couple of times. It was my own fault. Yes, but you can’t run a prison with kindness. You can even run hell with kindness. Major! They were right here. -Why would he cover his skin with polish? -We’ll find out. Maybe he’s not in prison anymore. -What if he’s escaped? -He’s still here. He can’t get out. You smoke? I hate its smell. I give it to the prisoners. -I have previous plans. I have to leave soon. -What plans? We need you here. Come back when you’re done. I told you everything I know. You may have forgotten some things. It’s better if you’re here. You want me to come back because I may have forgotten something? Yes. I didn’t think you’d be shy. Well you were wrong. I am very shy. Goodbye. I’m meeting the mother of one of the prisoners over there. -Didn’t they ask what it’s for? -I said it was for a police drill. They said they sent the dog to Tehran last week for training. -Where did you find this other one? -This one’s a sheepdog, but the owner says it’s the sister of the fire station dog. He says she’s smarter than the other one. -Where is it now? -In the public area. -Get the bag of clothes from the room. -Yes sir. The dog’s a bit tired now, but she’s much smarter than the other one. They were gonna take this one for the fire station first, but the other one was larger. I didn’t know! They guy praised the dog so much I thought it could do something. -If I’d known ... -Hush! Check it out. [If you find this frog please throw it in the pond behind the prison. May God bless you.] The back door is near the laundry room? Yes. Was it left open today? For a couple of hours when we were taking out the chairs and tables. So if he’s reached the yard, it’s possible he’s gotten out. There’s no access to the outside from there. It comes out right under the watchtower. Unless if ... -Sergeant? -What is it Asaadi? There’s a bunch of people with trucks and loaders at the door. They say ... wait a second ... they say we have to leave so they can begin demolition. -What should I do? -I’ll be right there. -You’re still here Major? -I’ll explain. The Colonel said it had been evacuated. -Didn’t he? -Yes, but a problem came up ... This won’t work. Please come here. See! I’ve been stuck in this situation for two weeks now. I haven’t been able to move forward an inch. -You’re absolutely right ... At most ... -Next week when the Empress comes, I have to have finished this lane. I told the minister just now. I told him we’d be able to deliver next week. -You heard me, didn’t you? -Yes. Sir, if we don’t complete demolition by tomorrow noon, we won’t be able to finish. Please don’t play with us. -We’ve been corresponding for three months! ... -Stop the demolition! -Stop! -Excuse me. What’re you doing? -Stop! Stop! -What’s going on sister? Please stop the demolition! My husband’s in there! Please stop! For the love of God! Don’t ruin it! My husband’s in there. -My Ahmad’s in there! -Okay, calm down. -For the love of God! -Let’s go in. My Ahmad! He’s in there. -Don’t tear it down. -Ahmad! -Haven’t you transferred the prisoners yet? -We’ve transferred all of them. You can come and see for yourself. Her husband was executed but she can’t believe it. She thinks he’s still in there. What time is it now? Ten minutes to one. We will definitely evacuate by five. I’ll be here at five. Well? The last time I came to visit he said he planned to escape. He said even if he got shot he wouldn’t let them hang him. When did you bring him the polish? Polish? What’s that? Nothing. Everyone knows he’s innocent. He hasn’t done anything. This all happened because he wouldn’t be bullied. For the love of God, don’t demolish if he’s still here. -How do you know he’s here? -He said so. Didn’t you? I saw her making a ruckus and I thought ... I know Ahmad. If he can’t escape, he’ll stay under the rubble and won’t come out. I’m too tired! I went to the other side but they said he wasn’t there. Everyone’s there, how come he’s the only one missing? He’s still here. Leave and we’ll figure it out. Reyhan? Reyhan? Reyhan? Where are you sweetheart? Reyhan?! Reyhan?! Reyhan?! Reyhan?! Major! Reyhan? -Where were you? -Mom! Wait a second. -Who gave you that? -Let’s go love. I told you to wait. What did she whisper in your ear? Nothing. Let her go! Let her go! Let her go! Please! -Who gave this to you? -Reyhan! Let me go! Where did you get this? Look at me. You can’t leave until you tell me. Did your dad give it to you? -She said she had to pee! -Be quiet! -I swear, she said she had to pee! -Did you get it from your dad? Did he give you this? Answer me! Did he give it to you? Look at me! Where did you see him? Where did you see him? Look at me! Stop crying! Look at me! -Where did you see him? -Sir, I gave it to her. I found her playing in one of the cells and gave it to her. Don’t touch her! Sweetheart, it’s okay... it’s okay. Naji? Sergeant Naji? Akbari? Is anyone there? Naji? Naji?! Thanks ... It suits you better. Every time I changed my uniform my father used to say, “You look normal now.” I thought you’d gone. I don’t know why I came back. What? I said I don’t know why I came back. I don’t know why I came back. A few hours ago I thought I was the luckiest man on earth. Nothing’s happened yet. Have you seen the basement plans? Sir, one of the prisoners saw him as he was escaping. It was all cleared out. And ... I was right here. There was a mound here ... a bit over there ... yes ... there was a small mound right here. And then something fell. I bent down to pick it up and heard a noise. I went to see what it was, and I saw something running toward that big rock. -And something black ... -What was he like? How tall was he? It was too dark, I only saw shadows. I couldn’t tell if it was human or demon. I’m sorry! How did he get out? If he’s gone this way, the only option is the back wall. And that’s impossible. We hadn’t removed the guardrails yet. Major! Say it. Sir, I was here this morning. It was covered in boards from here to there. They came up all the way. It was impossible to see the road from here. -When did you take them away? -A lot later. The prisoners were all gone by then. -Where did you take him? -Downstairs. -Take him to the interrogation room. -Yes sir. Yes, they’d piled the boards, but they weren’t glued together! I swear I could see the road from where I was standing. -Why would I lie? -Tell me exactly what you saw. Yes sir. When I lifted that last box at dawn, I suddenly saw a thin black shadow run on the road, toward the big rock. You said he went that way. No, no, I kept pointing this way. -I didn’t. -He’s right. You pointed the other way. No! Why’re you trying to mess me up? I keep pointing this way. I pick the box, and point with this arm. Even if you saw something, why would you report it now? Excuse me. Can I have some water? -Give him some water. -I gave him shoe polish, shoe polish! I was wrong! I gave him shoe polish! I didn’t know he wanted to escape! I saw a shadow this morning and thought I’d seen a demon or something. Then I heard he’d escaped. I thought if I didn’t say anything I’d get blamed. How can you escape with shoe polish?! He showed me why he wanted it. He made chess pieces with dough ... Major! Can you please come a minute? Prepare a report and send it to the station ... go back right away. We’ll pack up and come too. I fixed everything. It’s over. You were messing it all up. Don’t say anything else. Cigarette! More! -I don’t want any problems. -I told you, it’s over. But I mentioned the shoe polish. -Did you bring the shoe polish? -Yes! -Then why did you tell them? -He beat me. I had to tell the truth didn’t I? It’s ... Tell me when they’re coming to visit. I’ll convince them. Don’t worry. It came off! It was raining even harder this morning. He’s still in there. -Was his wife around? -I’ll ask the guards. The bastards! They told that scoundrel to say he’d seen him this morning. -When will Rauf get there? -In 15 or 20 minutes. Bring everyone we have upstairs. Leave the watchtower guards in place. Send up the rest. Hurry! Tell them the escape report is void. We’ll stay here. Ask Rauf to call me when he gets there. Just stay tuned ... Ahmad? Let me know if you’re here. I’m Karimi, the social worker. Ahmad? If I know where you are I can get you out of here. Answer me please. They may come at any moment. No one’s here now. I’m alone. Don’t be afraid, I want to help you. I tried to get them to leave so you could get out, but it didn’t work. If I know where you are I may be able to do something. Can you hear me? Ahmad? So you came back to help me? That I’m not as severe as the others say?! I should send you to court for assisting a death row inmate escape. Pack your things … and leave quietly. Put them away. The pencil. It was! He is innocent. If he returns to prison he’ll be hanged in a few days! -Believe me! -Out. If he’s stuck somewhere and can’t come out he’ll suffocate. And if I can’t find him I’ll lose my post. My life will be ruined. Yell if you need help. With a loud voice. Really loud. Complete Subtitles Exclusively Arranged by:- Samaksh ~ Varsha ~ Pankaj Jain Sir, there’s an old man here, says he wants to talk to you about Ahmad Redskin. Bring him in. Hello sir. What is it? Ahmad didn’t kill Sabouri. Sabouri fell. I was there that day. -I saw it with my own eyes ... -Where are you from? -Kerman. -What’re you doing here then? I married a woman from here and ended up staying. Ahmad is innocent. -The lady came and told me ... -Which lady? I don’t know her. The doctor. She said if I told you, you’d be able to do something for him. Ahmad is innocent. Sabouri fell. Last month the chief said I had to say I witnessed Ahmad push him. He said if I didn’t he’d throw me out. I swear I haven’t been able to eat or sleep for a whole month! I dream of the fires of hell every night! Please forgive me! I swear Ahmad is innocent! I wanted to say I’d lied, but if I did my wife and children would lose their home! -What could I do?! Please sir! -Naji? I swear Sabouri fell. Please sir! Can you set him free? Please help him! For the love of God! Let him live! I was wrong! He’s innocent! When you were downstairs Rauf called and said Seyyed Davood’s changed his mind and says he can’t build the gallows. Sergeant Naji, gather everyone in the yard. Prepare the cars. We’re leaving. She’s very weak. I wed her two years ago. She’s supposed to give birth today. I’m really worried doctor. Can we leave soon? -Wait in the car. I’ll be right there. -Okay. Thanks. -Do you have room in your car for this? -Yes. Pull aside. Pull aside! Come on. Hurry! What if he doesn’t come out? If he doesn’t come out it means he’s really not in there. Major! Good. Bastard! Bastard! No! What’s going on here? One of the guards has lost his mind and wants to kill himself. They’re gonna get him soon. Why haven’t you handed over this place yet? You should already be on the other side. We packed and were about to leave, but got stuck in this mess. We got a bit delayed. They're calling the Colonel from headquarters. What should I say? Tell them we’re on our way. He'll be right there. Send him to me when you find him. -Yes sir. -Here’s your assignment. Your replacement will be here in two days. Wrap it up and finish it in a day. He's covering his tracks. Maybe he wasn’t able to get to his hiding place. We’ll find him soon. We only have an hour. Call Rauf to send over anyone he can. -Hurry up. -Yes sir. Tell him if he needs to, he can send over the watchtower guards too. Yes sir. What’ll you do if you can’t find him? If you don’t let them know someone’s in here he may die under the rubble. -If he wants to stay alive he has to come out. -If he comes out he’ll be hanged in three weeks! It’s none of my business! If I can’t find him my life will go to shit! They’ll take away everything I have! Is this your idea of justice? Huh? We’re about to start. Are any of your men in there? Mr. Rahmani, let’s start. Get up! Get up! Let’s go! Hurry. Faster. [May God save and protect us. Amen.] Why’re you standing there? Get going. Hurry. Naji? Naji? -The crane! -What? -The crane! -It’s gone. Stop! Stop! Ahmad!
