(Shakespeare) In Japan, ballroom dance is regarded with much suspicion. In a country where married couples don't go out arm in arm... much less say "I love you" out loud... intuitive understanding is everything. The idea that a husband and wife should embrace... and dance in front of others is beyond embarrassing. However to go out dancing with someone else would be... misunderstood and prove more shameful. Nonetheless, even for Japanese people, ... there is a secret wonder about the joys that dance can bring. SHALL WE DANCE? Hisako that's enough. Let's go to one more bar. Even accountants need to be entertained. It's no fun drinking with co-workers. It's not fair! The sales team gets all the perks: golf, karaoke, clubs, fancy restaurants... I hate accounting. We don't even get expenses. You really hate it so much? Do you really like it so much? Not a matter of like or dislike; it's my job. Nine o'clock. Time to go home. It's still early! "The Kishikawa School of Dancing" You're early. I thought you were drinking with your staff. Something to eat? No thanks. I'm tired. I'll take a bath and go to bed. ...for what I'm about to receive. Your father rarely stays out late. You seem very pleased. He really should get out and enjoy himself more often. Why do you say that? Don't you think he's too serious? He works hard, then comes straight home every day. He bought us this house. That's what fathers do. I feel kind of bad. It's not as if you're lazing around. I suppose so. I'm glad you understand. But he does seem depressed lately. Poor dear gets up before either of us. So get up and make his breakfast. He says I don't have to. So that's being in love? You look so happy. I haven't worked for thirteen years. I quit when I was pregnant with you. It's tought but I'm happy to be working. I have to if we're to pay off the mortgage. How's your computer? Good morning. Here's my sheet. Bought a house did you? Somehow managed to. A wife, a daughter and now a house with a garden. Pledged my soul to the firm to pay for it. No worries. You're successful, you're moving up. Mr. Aoki, you've left a blank. Really? Show me. Sorry. I'll redo it. What came over me? That's so typical. Some systems analyst! He can't even use Windows. And he has the nerve to ask about my computer. I'll take Chikage and go look at clothes. Meet at the coffee shop downstairs. Still using the computer? I'll be finished soon. Okay. Later. What am I doing? Excuse me. Just let me get by. Get out of the way! I don't believe this! May I help you? Well... Your sign says, "Feel free to watch." - You want dance lessons? - Yes. Mr. Sakamoto... practice by yourself for a while please. No previous schooling? Right. - Dance experience? - I'm a total beginner. You'll need a book of tickets. You can reserve lessons when your instructor is free. Tickets are 1,000 yen. You'll need six per lesson. 6,000 per lesson? Yes? Seems rather expensive... They are private lessons. Excuse me, Mai. Let's take a break. Doesn't the beginner's class need one more? I thought it was full? No, we're one short. Group lessons are once a week for 2,000 yen. If you don't mind, it'll perhaps be best. Which is it? One hour group lessons are 8:00 p.m. on Wednesdays. It's better to start with a group. "Learn from other's mistakes." Group lessons, please. Your name and a contact number on here. Contact number? If that's a problem, just a name will do. Certainly. Books are ten, thirty and fifty thousand yen. I'll take the ten. Sorry to be late. Whatever happened? You are late. Can you forgive me? You devil, you! What is it about you? Let's rumba today. Go put your shoes on! I ran to get here! I demand overtime. So ravishing when angry... "Sunflower Dance Supplies" Looking for shoes? For modern dancing? I'm just starting. Then how about these? Eleven thousand five hundred yen! Beginner's group... come over here please. Class will begin. Let's start with the blues again. My name is Tamako Tamura. Disappointed I'm older? Not at all! You look very... forgiving. Thank you. Everyone calls me Tamako-sensei. How do you do? Pleased to meet you. Are you all beginners? My wife dragged me to a ballroom dance circle. Okay, so how should we do this? I don't mind starting from the very basics. Let's start with party dancing, then gradually move on... to the modern and Latin steps. I know those terms but these two probably... don't know anything about the various dances. Good point. Let me explain... The social dances include the waltz, tango... the slow fox-trot, quick step and the Vienna waltz. These make up the modern dances. The rumba, cha-cha-cha, samba, paso double... and jive constitute the five Latin dances. Together these are the ten competitive dances... and each qualifies for competition. I hope one day... you'll get to try them all. Today we'll start with the mambo. The mambo and the jitterbug are non-competitive... but you'll fear no party if you learn them. They're excellent foundations for ballroom dancing. Lead with your left foot. Your weight goes on your right foot. Bring the left up to meet the right. Go back with your right. Take the weight on your left. Then right up to the left. That's one set. Left-right-left... right-left-right. The first two are quick. Feet together is a slow step. Two quick equals one slow. Is that clear? Simple isn't it? These are the mambo's basic steps. Let's try with a partner. You two will lead. The leader, that's always the man... leads with his left. That's set in stone. Ladies respond with their right. Ready? Bring your feet together. I'm sorry. It's alright. From the top. Next is the half turn. Watch how I do it. Ready? Left foot, make a half turn, then bring both together. Right foot, half turn, then together. Now you try. No, no, no. Look how I do it. Left, turn, slow. Right, turn, slow. The fat gentleman can do it. Concentrate on your own steps please. Let's try it in pairs. Half turns are initiated by the man. Ladies respond one step later... and finish one step behind. Go back on the foot you lead with. From the top. Start on your left... this goes back. Right foot in and turn. The same foot as you lead with. You can do it. Once more. Feet together. Good exercise, isn't it? Yes, I'm exhausted. Give it our best shot! She sure is pretty. That's why you're here right? Private lessons... that's the way. Not that anything would come of it. You're better off in a class. She's all the sweeter when viewed from afar. If she hadn't split with her partner... she'd be so busy competing she'd have no time to teach here. That old goat comes three days a week. Still hasn't noticed she loathes him. Sooner or later he'll quit. Wonder how long you'll last. The missus literally dragged me over... to the local community center. A social dance circle. Taught by the local grocer. He's a real poseur. But he has the old dears drooling. He's really not that good. I'm taking these lessons secretly... to surprise him and the missus. What's your name? Tanaka. What's your excuse? Sorry. I shouldn't have asked a personal question. Doctor's advice. I'm diabetic. Really? And so young, too. It's good exercise. How about you? I also heard dancing's good for the health. That's what they all say. Am I the only one who's being honest? You look like a hot-shot, manager type. The old ducks in my dance circle... would love you. Well, time to go. Where do you live? Maybe I can drop you off. I live in Oji. All the way from Oji? And you, Mr. Manager? I'm no manager. I live out past Tokorozawa. That's miles away. Funny how we all travel so far, ain't it? Best kept under wraps, eh? They'll think we are a bunch of dirty old lechers. Before I go up the stairs at the school, I always... make sure no one's looking. Mr. Sugiyama, look up. Head up. Is Dad home yet? Not yet. He stays out late Wednesdays. That's good. You'd rather he wasn't here? You said he should go out and enjoy himself. Did I? But he does seem to be happier recently. That's good news. You were worrying that he was depressed. - Was I? - Yes, you were. Wonder what cheered him up. That's enough! It's not your private dance floor! And I'm sick of your one-trick rumba. A cheap imitation of Donny Burns. How can we tango to this rumba? Isn't your time up anyway? Get lost. Go practice somewhere else. Shut up... you fat, frustrated, old bag. What? Mr. Aoki? What's going on? This is pathetic. You beg me to be your partner... then you create a scene like this. I've never been so embarrassed. Get yourself a new partner. Letting this hysterical cow insult you. Who are you calling a cow? And you copied my dress! Take yours back to the shop! It sure was a shock to see you standing there. I didn't recognize you. Actually I was quite impressed. Five year's practice would make a dancer of anyone. Five years? I had no idea. I keep it well hidden. Everyone gets the idea that you're strange. Especially since I'm still single. Of course they think I'm just after girls. But when I finish work... put on the clothes, the wig and become Donny Burns... Latin world champion... and I start to move to the rhythm... I'm so happy, so completely free. You know how it is for me at work. But I blew it again. I take part in amateur dance competitions. J.A.D.A. organizes them... that's the Japan Amateur Dance Association. I'm at the third level. But I still can't find a good partner. I met that last one on a dance tour to England. Yes, to watch the competitions. She had no partner either so we teamed up. She was so young and pretty, single, too. It was a good chance. That fat old bag ruined it. She's probably rich... and has nothing to do but dance. Why did you start dancing? Well... I don't get much exercise recently. And I heard it's good for health. That's what they all say. Keep it secret. Imagine what they'd say at the office! Yes, of course. You could come to one of our dances. No thanks. I've barely begun. Doesn't matter. You look great. Better than me. It's easier if you go with someone. More women than men, so every man's a prize! Aren't you here to dance? No point standing around. I'll teach you. Let's dance. Be a man. Dance with me. Would you be so kind as to dance with me? Thank you. Are you alright? I'm sorry. Don't worry. Listen to the music. Start on the second beat. Okay? Two, three, four. I'm sorry. Are you alright? If you'll excuse me. He is acting weird. "Miwa & Co. Private Investigations" Excuse me. We offer free consultation. It's very discreet. Maybe we can help. He comes home late on Wednesdays and goes out on weekends. On these days his shirts always smell of perfume. Wednesday it's the same scent... On weekends it's mixed. He's seen making strange body movements. Besides that, it's a woman's intuition... Did you think of asking him? Yes, many times, but... But what? I'm afraid to. He's so straight. If it is another woman it'll be... more than just casual. And if he is having an affair? I've never even considered it. He might be caught up in... something weird? But if it is... an affair, I'm afraid... to think I might lose him. An investigation will cost at least 500,000 yen. That's usually sufficient... to gather evidence for a trial. Assuming we're talking about divorce. But we're not really sure it is an affair. You're right. In your husband's case... there is no history of adultery and if it's enough to establish... he's not mixing with some strange group... then how about this? We'll budget three days. If it takes less, we'll give a refund. Why not? I'm not opposed to you appearing. But you want him only because he's the best. That's not reason enough to choose a partner. Yes, it is. I'm a top class dancer too. You just want to spite your previous partner. Ever wonder why he left you? He betrayed me. I was dancing well. His mistake caused that accident. He didn't ever try to cover for me. You still think so? It's not a partner's skill you are lacking. It's your dancing. Why can't you understand? How can I? You force me to teach these clods in the barn. Is that my lesson? You yourself learnt on this very same dance foor. Starting this school was our dream. I'm working. I'm giving lessons. Why can't I get a new partner? Why can't I dance at recitals? Come in. Tamako-sensi called to cancel today's lessons. I see. Sorry to interrupt. Re-schedule your private lesons... and take tonight's group lessons. Lucky boy! Tonight she's in your arms at last. Any preferences? How about the waltz? Mr. Sugiyama? Yes. Why not? Then let's practice the waltz. I'll take you through the steps you've learned. Mr. Sugiyama, you first. Are you really a reporter? Not just chasing after her like everyone else? No, not me. I'm working. Really? Can you dance? Wish I could, but I've never had the chance. C'mon let's try. I'll be the lead. I'm on duty. Give it a try. He takes dance lessons every Wednesday. So he is involved in something strange. His instructor is a middle aged-woman. Tonight's substitute was quite pretty. I wouldn't mind dancing with her myself. Getting around like this? You are kidding. Dancing doesn't suit the Japanese body. Guess he's just another dirty old man. That substitute is looking for a partner. He's certainly aiming hight. Sensei. What is it? Thank you for today's lesson. Not at all. I'm not as experienced as Tamako-sensei. No, no, you were very good. I was impressed. Thank you. No. I thank you. I thought I'd go and eat. I haven't had dinner yet. But eating alone spoils the taste. If you haven't eaten, perhaps we... I'm sorry. I prefer not to have private contact with students. I see. Excuse me. One thing. This may seem rude... but I hope you didn't join the class with me as your goal. I take dancing very seriously. It's a classroom not a disco. Don't dance if that's what you're after. Every Wednesday your husband attends... a ballroom dancing school. Presumably he's late Wednesday smelling of perfume... because of the dancing lessons. One other point. On weekends he goes to dance with his classmates. The weekend perfumes you noticed... are from dancing with the various women there. Our brief wasn't to prove adultery... so it's too early to make that conclusion. Is this pretty lady his teacher? His regular teacher is a more mature woman. That lass is a substitute teacher. I've never seen him this happy. Personally, I don't think your husband.. is having a relationship whit her. What makes you think so? Experience as a detective. But why dancing? Him, dancing? I can't believe it. Perhaps a woman on weekends. I can investigate further. You have nothing to worry about. We don't know why he started dancing. But the secrecy is surely because he's ashamed. Experience again? As a man... yes. I suspect he will soon give up dancing. - Why do you say that? - A hunch. He will tire of it. I wonder... Some hunch. You forgot this! Sorry, I'm so rushed. Busy as always. Thank you very much. I don't get it. It must be that substitute. Your improved posture will give you away! Hello there. You're really improving. A compliment from you, is praise indeed. You're conscious of every footstep? No, not yet. But your posture is so good. Is it really? It gets dangerous when it's second nature. Is that right? Like golfers swinging their umbrellas at the train station. Think I'll be practicing on the platform? That's hard to imagine. Well, you'd be the last one to notice. Dance is that captivating. Maybe. I never thought I'd get in this deep. Have you been to a dance hall? No, not yet. It's a lot of fun. We should go sometime. "You'd be the last to notice." That flashy guy is "Jitterbug Hama" He's a dance hall regular. Those sitting over there... are waiting to be asked to dance. You can hire a pro from the counter, over there. Ms. Ishizaka, your partner awaits you. Enjoy yourself. I'll be dancing with Marika. Is that you Mr. Sugiyama? Ms. Tamako. What are you doing here? That's my line! I work here part time. I'm alone so, I've nothing to do on days off. I moonlight here to keep dancing. On your own? No, I'm with Aoki. She's very pretty. Who is she? His new partner. They entered... the Eastern Dancing... Eastern Amateur Dance Gala? Yes, that's it. He insists on dancing with such young girls. Hope he's not dumped again. He should dance with Toyoko. She's also looking for a partner. How about you? Not in competition, no way. Isn't she fantastic? Aoki is very much a Latin man. He won't dance anything but Latin. May I have this dance? Hang on a minute! If that's okay with you. Shall I introduce you to someone? If you don't mind, I'd prefer to dance with you. How sweet! But don't feel obliged. Try someone else perhaps. It's not that. Some of my steps still need work. So earnest! Here you can forget the steps and enjoy yourself. That's "Joe Blues" over there. They say he can make your backbone melt. This tune. Remember The King and I? That bald actor. Yul Brynner. It was that film which started me dancing. It still sets my heart racing. He held Deborah Kerr's hands like... Dance is more than... just the steps. Feel the music and just dance for sheer joy. Watch it! - Sorry. - Forgive us. Oh, it's you! Be careful. You've got nerve, you're hopeless! You forced me. I said I couldn't. Sometimes the worst dressed dance best... like good dancers who say they can't. Toyoko please! Tamako-sensei! Come see this. Isn't that Mr. Kimoto? Yes. I hear he's going to give a demonstration. What's happening? He's a dance instructor, an all-Japan finalist. He suddenly split with his partner. Look, isn't that Mai? So the rumor is true. - Rumor? - You know, breaking up with her partner. Did she? You should know, you're the one who likes her! They did great at Blackpool, then suddenly split up. Blackpool, the top world competition. Don't you even know that? Some say that Kimoto and Mai fell in love... and engineered the break-ups to get together. Interesting place isn't it? You're suggesting we dance here? Isn't that why you're defying your father? But why here? It's not like we have to dance among them. We needed a place for our debut... and the owner kindly offered us this anniversary event. But this is not ballroom dancing. Lounge lizards and showgirls. What's wrong with that? They're having a wonderful time. Doesn't their dancing thrill you... fill you with inspiration? Blackpool has a history... but in its own way, so does this dance floor. So there's no hope then? "Why should I, a Blackpool semi-finalist... dance in a dump like this?" Am I right? Is this some kind of test? It wasn't intended to be, but it is now. So I must have failed? I can't dance here. That's a shame. Good luck finding someone. You too. You should lighten up and enjoy your dancing. It's more than just competition. I'm not suggesting we go to a hotel... It's a short cut. I thought... maybe we could become partners. But our styles are too different. No couple gets it right away. We need practice. No, that's not it. When we're talking like this, you're fine. But it's so creepy. Your dancing, it gives me the creeps. Mr. Sugiyama? Not here yet. You'll do. Be my partner for a minute. Good evening. What's this? Looks like Tanaka's being auditioned as a partner. She's determined to move up to the next level. They say men take three times longer to learn than women. Stop. Control yourself! Slobbering like that. Your hands are dripping wet. You're making me sick. There's no way you're becoming my partner. You dragged him out there! Shut up short-ass. That's rude! You should watch what you say. Fussy little man... with your fussy little steps! You want to talk about my steps? What about them? Go on... share your wisdom! Do I really make you sick? Am I really that disgusting? The first girl I ever liked said that. And I wasn't even dancing. My doctor recommended dancing as exercise. First I was embarrassed. But soon all my cares were gone... like being drunk. My heart singing. Fireworks exploding in my head. All my worries forgotten... and I began to love dance. But I suppose... even when I'm dancing... Do I really look that bad? No, of course not. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. Forgive me. Toyoko! This is the third time she's collapsed from overwork. This is Toyoko's daughter. Sorry for all this trouble. You must be Mr. Sugiyama. Yes. She tells me everything. Said you were elegant... a little like my late father. She seemed sad to hear you had a family. I hope she wasn't too pushy. She's under such pressure lately. She can't find a partner. The last one insulted her dancing. She's desperate to enter the competition. She works hard at two jobs. And helps out a friend's restaurant. Every night she's out dancing. No wonder she collapsed. How long has she been widowed? As far back as I can remember. She gave up dancing to concentrate on raising me. She first met him at a company dance party. It's by far her favorite memory of him. She's always telling that story. She regrets I missed seeing him waltz. But Japanese ballroom dancing is pityful. Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. Why don't you be Toyoko's partner? No, I'd be terrible. You'd be okay. I guarantee it. She'd never agree. My dancing is far too bad. She'll be fine. You heard what her daughter said. She's quite fond of you. And dance begins with the dancer's feelings. Besides, you're not a bad dancer. Spare me just two hours, three times a week after class. Two hours? I won't charge you. Special training. There's still three months before the competition. We'll be able to do it. Isn't that right, Mai? You look fit as a fiddle. I'm full of energy and raring to go! You're a brave man... or you've got strange tastes. Look, I don't know what my daughter said to you. But I don't want sympathy, okay? Stop being so defensive. He agreed because Mai asked him to do it. You hardly need sympathy. I guessed as much. Ready? Let's begin. We'll need to do the waltz and the quick-step. Plus the rumba and paso doble. Dance them in that order. First the waltz. Wait! If you don't lead this is hopeless! We haven't covered that yet. You've got to be joking! And you want to be my partner? That's enough! He's already under pressure. Don't make it worse. Bear her no mind. I just wanted to see you two paired. We'll stick to modern today. Everyone's worried about you. You don't come to practice. Me too, I've... I've ended up in the competition. And with that Toyoko Takahashi too. Once more. Good night everyone. If you'll excuse me. Good evening. Hello again. Glad you came. What about trying Mr. Aoki... for the Latin program? You must be joking! Give me Sugiyama any day. But I was watching his rumba the other day. It still needs a lot of work. I'm not saying he can't do it... but his Latin will take time to improve. Both may be a bit too much. I was going to ask you if we could stick to just one... when Mr. Aoki happened to call. There's someone he must beat in this competition. And Mr. Aoki is, after all, a Latin man. So if Toyoko will do... I mean, seeing that you two haven't always gotten along so well. Teaming with me to get revenge? Must be a big deal. Don't tell me that latest little bimbo... up and left you again? Trash your style, did she? Yes, she did. She insulted me. Said my dancing made her sick! Are you busy tonight? Not particularly. Would you mind taking Mr. Sugiyama? I want to watch these two. Don't hesitate! Really put that right foot out. Ready? Once more, from the top. That first step is so important. You're still hesitating. The leader must commit his whole body... to convey to his partner... the tone of the entire dance. A weak first step transmits nothing. This is how you did it. See how it says nothing? Be confident, you must stride. It's most important that your own right side... remains firmly up against your partner. Feel that? Shall we? That's not it. Take a bigger stride. Yes. That's more like it! Now let's try it with Toyoko. Watch them, Mai. Wait for her to come. Then take her firmly. Do you see? The judges watch from the minute you start. Don't hold back. You're already hesitant. Pull her in closer. Take a big stride with the right. Toyoko, will you stop that! But he's stiff as a board. I'm terribly sorry. Not that! Here, from the heart. Will you both try to be serious. We're serious, aren't we? Would you consider tutoring them for the competition? Wait for her to come to you. Look left. Is he okay? I'll call an ambulance. To win, you need to stand out and to dance well. With anywhere up to ten couples on the floor at once... you're lucky to get ten seconds from the judges. This is the quick-step format. You enter from here. With an initial sweep past the crowd. Alternating scissors... Then a side-chass?.. change direction. To a running finish and natural turn. Isn't it exciting! The waltz usually begins facing outward... and starts with a half-turn... leaving the middle wide open. So take center stage and do something unusual. Even if they hate it, the judges will be watching. Are you alright? Let's take a break. Mr. Sugiyama's exhausted. No, I'm fine. - I'm beat too. I'll get drinks. - I'll go. It's okay. Mineral water for you, Chinese tea for him. Thanks. Sorry, I'm getting carried away. No need to apologize. At my age, it's embarrassing to say so... but every day I feel so alive. Even being tired feels great. It's been a long time since I felt this enthusiastic. It's a good feeling. Lately, I've begun... to think about Blackpool again. Up until just recently... I haven't wanted to. Blackpool... is a small, seaside resort town. Normally it's very quiet. But that completely changes... for the championship week. I first went to Blackpool when I was five. The central ballroom... was so big and so splendid. I joined all those strangers... imitating their steps. I'll never forget the finals at the Winter Garden. Particularly one young couple. They lost in the semi-finals. They had the most enchanting quick-step routine. But just at the end... they collided with another couple. He fell heavily and ended up in the hospital. But both my parents... were tremendously impressed. I asked why. Father explained that to the end he tried to protect his partner. Since that first day in Blackpool... dance has become my entire world. What started me dancing... was you gazing out of the window like that. You can see that window from the trains. Every day on the train home I looked for you. When I saw you, somehow I felt relieved... or disappointed if you weren't there. Your melancholy look... It totally charmed me. I married at age 28. Had a child by 30. At 40, I bought the home I longed for. I've worked so hard for these things. I thought it was a happy life... but after I bought the house... something changed. It's no reflection on my wife... or on my love for my daughter. But something was different. I need to work to pay the mortgage. I accepted that... but something was still missing. Then you appeared. Looking up and seeing you there... made me want... just one time... to dance with you. Even after... I was very rude to you... you stuck with dancing. I really felt like giving up. But if I had... I would have been everything you accused me of. Of course, it's true... that affection for you... was what brought me to the class. But to be confronted with it... was a shock. I thought, "She didn't have to be like that." I wanted to prove to you... that it wasn't because of you. I said I was here to dance. But... But what? No sooner did I decide to continue... than I really began to like it. I was... watching you too. From the window here... I saw you practicing on the platform. It warmed my heart. I'll never forget it. It's just not fair. Selfish man. "Eastern Japan Amateur Dance Competition" Here we go. Mr. Sugiyama, you look so serious. Relax a little. Ready? Cheese! How come you're here? Inspired by our enthusiasm. This is the missus. Don't be so rude! This is my niece. The wife roped her in too. Tanaka wanted a partner. They dance great together. Mr. Sugiyama. That suits you. My late husband's best tails. You deserve a medal for putting up with her. Enough from you! Go and save seats for us. The first round will be the rumba. Number 109... Number 110... 114... 116. Mr. Aoki looks like he's going for it. Fussing with your hair! Our routine was crap. They deliberately messed with it. Take the damn thing off and dance! You wouldn't understand! Bald creeps are not my specialty. Alright then. Let's get rid of it! Mr. Aoki's fantastic. He cast off more than just the wig. Mom. They're announcing finalists. I'm coming. Numbers 101, 103... 106, 109... 110... 114... 115... 121... I thought Mr. Macho was pretty good. Bad attitude. "Ungentlemanly behavior" It's a British sport after all. He'll be too nervous even to hear the music. You must guide him. Leave it to me. Mr. Sugiyama. We're on. Mr. Sugiyama... just flow with the music... and enjoy the dance. First round. The waltz. Here they are. But they look nervous. No, over there. Did you arrange this? I had no choice. It's easiest if she sees for herself. She's headed for a breakdown. You're a detective, not a marriage counselor. You're not even billing her. There's Dad. The start is everything. Take a deep breath. Now! They did it! Points lost there. But who's fault is it? That's why I don't like amateurs. Can't keep from bumping into others... or being bumped themselves. How you react is most important. Judges naturally notice bumping. But a quick recovery and a calm return to dancing... on the contrary... can be noted and scored pretty highly. You're hooked aren't you? C'mon, Dad! So close and he doesn't notice us. Is your daughter here? I hardly think so. I could be mistaken... but I'm sure I heard a girl call out... "C'mon, Dad!" just as we began. And now for the quick-step. Well done! He's great. He's doing well. Told you. Dad! Watch out! You knew? Yes. For a long time. But I was afraid to talk about it. I kept thinking you'd tell me. But you didn't say a word. At first, I thought it was an affair. It was a relief to find out it wasn't. But I still couldn't understand why. It brought you to life. I felt completely on my own. Today when I saw you... it was even harder to understand. It hurts so much. Even if it was dancing... it was still an affair. It wasn't just an affair. I was seriously involved. Until today. Until today? Yes. I've finished with dance. Why? Because of me? It'll be all my fault. No, not at all. It's just not for me... that's all. Hey, look at this. It'll blow you away. What is it? You won't believe your eyes! Is that Aoki? Read this part. "After suddenly doffing his trademark wig, Donny Aoki... swept the floor before unexpectedly defaulting." "Donny" Aoki! That bald jerk. Ballroom dancing... of all things! You can just imagine that dirty pervert. There's nothing wrong with it! If you've never danced... you should watch what you say. - Hi there! - Hello. I hope you didn't quit dancing because of me. I really don't care, let's dance again. You were dancing really well. You did so well in just a year, don't throw it away. It's not that. I've just had enough of dancing. I began on a whim. You saw the results. I'm sorry for disturbing you more dedicated dancers. Please forgive me. Forget all that. It doesn't matter. Maybe you have a lot on your mind. But if you want to dance, call me. I won't stand for you dancing with anyone else! Mai is going to England. We're having a farewell party next Friday. Please join us. Mai would be pleased. This is a letter from her. Thank you so much. Please do not laugh at me... for saying this... but I want to thank you... from the bottom of my heart. In the competition you danced superbly. You did your utmost... to protect Toyoko. She is fully aware of that. We all know you did your very best. And that's why Toyoko put her trust in you. She really does want to dance with you again. Remember I once told you about Blackpool? I didn't tell you about my failure there. That's because I never really faced up to it myself. But now I can tell you about it. Two years ago, when we finally arrived there... I was realizing a dream... so thrilled just to be there. I'd sacrificed everything for competition. I had an excess of self-confidence. The audience's support for us was overwhelming. We made it to the semi-finals. I rode on the waves of applause and cheering. I was thrilled and moved, and I danced my best ever. And then... just like you... we collided during the quick-step. I blamed my partner. Why didn't he protect me? His reaction stunned me. He wanted us to break up. Even if we did go on to win... he wanted us to split after the competition. I couldn'y understand. We were both aiming for the top. Why did he betray me? Soon after I returned to Japan. I wanted to show him up... so I looked for a top-class dancer. But my father wouldn't let me take a new partner. He had me teach at his school. He never wanted me to teach... but he made sure I did. I didn't understand why. I was so unhappy... reluctantly teaching. Then you arrived at the school. During the months we practiced for the competition... something began to change within me. I came to realize that I had always danced alone... never fully trusting my partner. My failure at Blackpool... was not his fault. It was a natural result of me dancing only for myself. It was you who taught me... the splendor... of dance when you trust and enjoy. I decided to start again from the beginning. So thank you very much. I'm looking forward to seeing you at the party. Going to the party? She's going to England, right? Seems you know everything. I owe you an apology. I hired a private detective. I was afraid to ask you. You've always been so serious. And because I love you. Please go and dance with her tomorrow. Continue your dancing. I'd rather you were full of life... than see you look so down. Teach me to dance too. Dance with me the way you would with her. Will you be quiet! I quit dancing! Why not dance with Mom? Do it! Dance with each other. You were wonderful. Please dance for me. When I move my left, go back on your right. If it's my right, then it's your left. We turn 90 degrees to the right... and bring our feet together. Back on my left, you come right. My right, your left. As you turn 90 degrees, bring both legs together. Alright, once more. I'm sorry that I made you feel so lonely. "Going shopping later with Chikage. See you after the party. Love Masako." Where's Sugiyama? He's already left. He has? Is Sugiyama here yet? Not yet. That's strange. He's already left work. Look at Hattori showing off. Go dance when the rumba starts. Sitting waiting isn't going to bring him here. Maybe he's not coming. "Shall we dance Mr. Sugiyama?" And now for the final number this evening. This time let's have Ms. Mai choose her own partner. Shohei Sugiyama... Koji YAKUSHO Mai Kishikawa...
