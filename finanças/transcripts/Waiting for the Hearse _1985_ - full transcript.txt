WAITING FOR THE HEARSE Susana! I can't leave the mayonnaise! It goes bad if I stop now! She must be hungry, I'll make her a feeding bottle. No, Mom. Her last one was half an hour ago. - Where are you going? - She must be nervous. Want me to give her a teaspoon of linden tea? No, don't give her anything. Don't give her anything! Just put the pacifier in her mouth and leave her. But, Susana, you know that if I stuck it into her mouth... she spits it out. She does that all the time. Know something... it may be your milk. See? You are too strung up of late. How come you see me nervous? Jorge, check if she's soiled herself. - She has! - Could you change her diapers? No! I've told you I don't like to do that. - Oh, then I'll do it. - No! No. You stay here. Here! I'll go. Big deal, changing a diaper, you'd say. Susana, do you want me to do anything? Can I help you out? No, don't! Why don't you sit down and read the newspaper! Don't say that to her. You make her feel useless. I'd rather she stayed still. This must be for making flan. Oh, crybaby, Mummy was making dinner. Here, take this to the bathroom and be careful not to drop anything. I leave, and you start crying. - Can you iron, Jorge? - You know that if I do... ...I'll burn myself. - I'll do it, Susana. I'm not speaking to you, Mama Cora. - Where did I put the pin? - Oh, be careful! Oh, don't you move, my angel, don't move. It's gone. I don't see it. - take another one, from the closet. - the closet, the closet. Why do you ask me? You know I don't know anything. Oh, so learn! From inside the closet. Inside, inside, but, where? Oh, Jorge, don't make me yet more nervous! Don't do this, don't do that, as if I was useless. I can't even touch the little kid. this feels like a rock. Oh God! It needs some sugar. Look, noodles, she has it all mixed up. - And this, what is this? - Your mother's. As we starve her to death, she hides her food under the pillow. - Here's the pin. - Well, let her help you. - She's not useless. She's not crazy. - Isn't she?! Well, darling, take it easy. Now, let's get some sleep. till your next bottle, ok? - Shall we put her in the stroller? - Are you asking me? My other husbands are not available now. - Who do you want me to ask! - Eh, how should I know? - You feed the baby omelet? - No! Your mother hid it, those are leftovers from last night. that's why this room smells bad. - Smells, how? - Don't you have a nose? Don't you smell, as I do? It smells of rotten food! - So, is she asleep? - Almost. - What happened? - Where? With the mayonnaise. What? that was mayonnaise? - Where's the mayonnaise? - I thought that... What did you think? - Didn't look like mayonnaise, Susana. - What have you done to my mayonnaise?! Flan. You talked about making flan last night. You heard her, Jorge. Was she or wasn't she going make flan? Mom! Four eggs, liters of oil... - Wait. ...liters of milk, salt... - Wait. ...mustard, and surely tons of sugar, all wasted! Oh! Why would you do that, mom? Didn't look like mayonnaise, Jorge. You can't do anything without asking first! And stay put! Don't move! Didn't look like mayonnaise! Wait, where are you going? Wait! Wait! Wait, where are you going? - Matilde, the phone is ringing! - Don't you know she's sleeping? You go get it! - today is my resting day. - I'd like to know when mine is. Hello. Yes. No, no Pirula here. And answer the phone if it rings! - I won't move from this couch. - Hey, hey, hey. I never get a break and I don't make such a big deal of it, ah? I would have liked to stay in bed until 11. But you had the brilliant idea of inviting your brother... Antonio, and Nora for lunch. You could have told them not to come and that was the end of it. And leave you without Nora's hugs and flirting? What hugs? - What do you want? < turn the tap off < I'm taking a bath here! < I'm not using water here. And what should I do now? I am covered in soap suds! Mom! - No water, again. - And you want me to take a bath. Mom, what am I going to do now?! Maybe stop breaking my... No, Do?a Luisa, not you. It's Elvira, what happened with the water? I made some pasta, it's a major tragedy. Oh, you made pasta, too? What a coincidence! Well, please do me a favor, don't let the water go to waste. I mean, when you're done please, call me... I'll go get the water for my pasta. thank you, you're so good. I make casserole, she makes casserole. I make pasta, she makes pasta. What a country! Mom. Mom! - Oh, it's too cold! - Sure it is, it was in the fridge. - You want me to catch pneumonia. - So ungrateful. Now, get dressed... for you need to go buy 3 bottles of mineral water. But I went to bed at 4 o' clock in the morning. Where was she? Did the neighbors see her? Who brought her home? - You gave her permission? - What should I answer first? I was in a cabaret with two hundred sailors! Hey, brat, don't mess up with me. Don't you play with me, ah? I'll give her a spanking one day... one she'll remember her whole life! Oh, I'm beat! - Why? - Nothing. I've scratched my butt all day long. Listen, are you aware of the work it takes to run a house? My mother was widowed at age 38, and with four kids. - Yes, I know this tango. - She worked all day long. Yes, she cooked, sewed, knitted, did other people's laundry... and I guess she broke the balls. No one ever hear her complain! told it to me about a million times. But I'm made of flesh, she's made of steel! - Poor old lady. When I think of all her suffering and the little happiness she had. If it's them I'll kill myself. What is it? - I'mjust 30 years old. - It's fine. - 33! - 32! And I can't just take this... of living in a house where I'm just a servant. there you go again... Why don't you take care of your own business! Because this business is yours too, darling! Do you know what happened? Susana was making mayonnaise, great! And Mom took it and turned it into flan. Oh, what a tragedy! It's been 4 years now with "your" mother in law living in "my" house, and with the firm idea of never leaving! - My mother in law, you say? - Yes! And your mother! She's no nuisance, for God's sake! She's such a saint. What does she do? He asks, what does she do? She's in the kitchen, in the bathroom, in the bedroom, the living room, the hall, the terrace and here! I have her here! How can you talk like that of a poor old lady who may have... ...just 3 years left to live? - Yes, and that's too much, too. that was what they told me, darling, when she came home 4 years ago, but, it's over! It's over! I've done my share! And I can't stand that big picture of your dad in the living room! - Poor Mom. - I don't want pictures in my dining room! My father is dead, too and I keep his picture inside a drawer. to make matters worse, last week started soiling herself! - Soiling? - What do you mean? Yes! She craps in her pants! And I won't run after her with a diaper as if she were a little kid! I have to go after her with a rag wiping her... - Poor lady. - And all this mess because of this? - this is no joke. She meddles all the time. - Maybe she wants to help. So let her keep still, hand off my stuff. I don't want help! two weeks ago, we were not home, she tried to give the baby a bath. - that's nice. - She almost drowned her. that's... - Bring her here, for a while. - Here! But, poor lady! Where do you want me to put her? In the small room, back there. - the room full of all sorts of stuff? But, poor lady, there is no room, not even for a pin. So put her here, or in your bed, but she's got to leave my house. Your husband is the eldest son, isn't he? But I am the youngest sister in law of us three. But, why did you think about bringing her here? - Aren't there any more brothers? - I give a damn... ...where she goes or with whom! - My pasta. I just want her out of my house! Cut it out, damn! Shut up! Just this once! She's my mother, ah? And you, why don't you look for a place for her? You're her son, just as I am. Besides, your wife is much more patient than mine is. More patient maybe, but I have my nerves, too! I can't be cleaning, every time she goes... If she needs a nurse to take care of her, we could all pay our share. And where would the nurse stay? the old lady is out of my house. Hey, you can't kick my mother out just like that, got it? Antonio is coming in no time, make him the offer. Something tells me that we'll spend a special day today. Come in, how are you, darling? - Oh, pastries, your are so mean! - Same as usual. - they make me fat. - Always watching your weight! - How are you, Antonio? - How are you? More guests. What a surprise! What a pleasant surprise! - How are you, darling? - And you? this heat kills me. Hi there, lovely guy. this man has happiness painted on his face. How are you? My wonderful lover. Hey, you're insisting too much with that, you're making me suspicious. But it is true, darling. How can you not believe me? It's offensive. How are you, Susie? Long time no see, and I love you so much. You look great. So calm. that's your best quality. You're the image of peace to me. You're like the image of green prairies in England. - Green, pleasant, generous. - You never fail to diagnose well! Hey, you promised me ravioli and your great tomato sauce! - I made them myself, homemade. - He dreams of your cooking, dear. - Does he? - Yes, he remembers you... every time he sees the stains on his shirts, left by your sauce. What's your secret? the stains won't come off! Why did delicious family reunion? - Stop it, will you? We were not invited! You have to be rich for them to invite you! What do you think? You mean Antonio pays me every month? Now, now. We came to spend a pleasant Sunday with... the family. In peace, all happy, a day of national reconciliation. Wrong timing, I'll tell you. Fine, done. Have the guests come into the living room. Nora, give me this... your gloves, so divine! And your fur, too. - Your sunglasses, of course. - No! Not the sunglasses. - I hate noon sunshine. - Fine, I'll go change my clothes. - Sergio, you pour the drinks. - Drinks? She speaks English? Lessons are working, aren't they? Yes, now she can say "No' in 4 or 5 languages. - Don't be mean. - Me? Mean? I'd kill for a Vermouth. I need to wake up. How the baby, Jorge? She's not a year old yet, is she? that baby holds a special place in my heart. Don't I always mention her, Antonio? Whom? Little Matilde, you come to make the family image complete. - Hi, Uncle Jorge. - this girl makes you feel younger. Listen, can't you make some time to visit us? You live just 4 blocks away, and haven't met your niece yet. I do. I went to the hospital when she was born. true. We brought her a rattle, a shirt and a bottle of shampoo. Can't you remember? - Hi, Uncle Antonio. - Hi, baby. Aunt Nora! - What a lovely dress! - Like it? I bought it in Miami. Gorgeous, isn't it? - Itt's like a dream! - Matilde! Hand this glass to your aunt. Susana, what will you have? If auntie is having Vermouth, then I guess I'll have nothing. - Why do you say that? - Because my brother in law said, Hand this glass to your aunt", I'm not her aunt. I'm poor! You're all strung up, dear. Auntie. thanks, dear. - I'll bring you one, Aunt Susana. - Don't you know I don't drink! then why all the fuss? - Where's the brandy? - Mom keeps it locked up. - Get me some whisky, then. - Whisky? there's none. Elvira, where's the brandy? Matilde, come and get the bottle! When will you bring the baby for us to see her? the garden's so... wonderful! It's inspiring. - You must come. When, I say? - Whenever you invite us. tomorrow. No, not tomorrow, let's make it tuesday. No, not on tuesday. Wednesday. I'll phone you on Wednesday, and then we'll set the date. the baby can play in the sunshine, run in the garden... She can't walk yet. But she can breathe, I guess. I love children. Maybe that's why God doesn't send me any. Have you seen a doctor? Sometimes it's the man who's no good. - How do you know that? - I'm good enough, baby. How do you know? You may be able to ejaculate, but that's not... What's she talking about? Sounds like a whore. - Elvira, heard that? - It's all natural. No talk of natural things in my house! What's this? A whore house? I read it in the magazine you keep on your night table. - Look at Sergio's face. - Oh, Dad. You don't think I'm still a virgin, do you? For your own sake I hope you are! - Elvira? Heard that? Hi. Oh, Do?a Elisa. What's that? Oh, just a minute. Mom, it's that witch next door. - You idiot, she'll her you. Says she's used the water but now it's mixed with flour. So go all the same, be careful not to burn your hands. - Why must it always be me? - Take the pot holders! Matilde! - She'll burn her fingers! - Too bad for her! There's no water since this morning. It's a good thing the... neighbor, that witch, is a copycat. I make casserole, she makes... casserole. I cook pasta, she cooks pasta. What? - See, a coincidence. - Elvira, the phone! Oh, think she heard what I said? Oh, dear, hope she didn't! Hello. No... She did hear! Stupid creature! Mom, Do?a Elisa says we can all go fuck ourselves! You idiot! Who told you not to hang up the phone? Nobody! I'm self-taught. What will happen when I start making demands, uh? Because I can be demanding. Or can't I? What if I say, this is my furniture, these are my cooking pots. What, then, uh? Let me see. What's up? What's this? Oh, dear... What was I talking about? Hey, bus! Stop! - Where are you going? - Where do you want to go? to Emilia's. She lives... On that avenue. Where was it? It's quite far, I tell you. One day, I'll start getting tough. then they'll see. they"II see. I can be very demanding. this is Sergio's house. Let me see. Mama Cora, come. - Me? - Yes, you. Come, come. Oh, what a coincidence, I was thinking of you today. - See? Believe it or not. - Watch the traffic, Mama Cora. - Now talking of Rome... - Watch out! ...the Pope shows up! I was thinking of your Mom's stuffed roast today. Dominga, now, what was I going to tell you? I forgot. My head! I forgot what I was going to say to you. - I called you over, Mama Cora. - Whom? - You! - Oh, I hadn't realized. After lunch I'll take you our for a ride. So you get some fresh air, ok? Now, what would be great would be if you took her home with you. Oh, poor thing. She'd get so bored. We're never home. Antonio is all day long at the office... and I never let a day go by when I don't visit my mother. Besides, I must confess I have no patience with old people. Mom? to be honest, if Antonio brought the old lady home, then... my dear mother would die. She's so jealous. - I think Mummy would die. - Mum? May I go...? - What about your house, Sergio? - there's no room here. We've discussed it already with Susana. Impossible! No room! Antonio, it was Mum's birthday last week. Fuck! It slipped my mind! You could have called me. that's being mean, Jorge. Well, anyway, she lives with you, so... you owe her more than we do. No big deal! So, that's great! She lives we us, so we owe her more? I hope Jorge's giving her all she needs, does he? Why do you hope so? You know what his salary is? Fine, stop this. I spent all winter saving cents, to buy myself a warm coat, but the old woman got sick, her liver it was, and my savings... had to go to pay the doctors, and medicine. None of you... ever called us to ask if we needed any help. - Now, stop it. - Yes, do, please. It's not about money, Nora, I'm rather tired, and I want to live... with my husband and baby, just the 3 of us, alone. Dear! Am I not entitled to a month's vacation? Of course you are. Nobody here says you are not. But, it would be extremely cruel, I believe... to tell the poor old lady, all of a sudden, that noble lady... that she must move and go live with another one of her sons. She's be elated if her sons fought over having her. You must be very careful, about that, don't you think so, dear? I'd be willing to give you some money every month? - How much should it be, Jorge? - We don't need your money! All we ask is that you take her to your house, for some time! Wait, wait! It's my mother you're talking about! I won't have you talk about her as if she were a dog... ...or a pair of worn-out shoes! - What about Emilia? and ever since her husband died... support that bum of a son she has. that moron. Cacho. Cacho! but they never stop smiling. Emilia's almost starving. that's why I never visit her. I can't stand her poverty! Now that you mention it. that sauce smells great! When are we having lunch? - Come on, people want to eat! - that's true. I am really hungry. - Laugh, Susana. - I don't feel like laughing. All I want is the old woman out of my house. If I hadn't met that saint, I'd say she was a witch. Mom is the sweetest human being in Earth. A saint like her, lights up your home. Our house is always dark. Mama Cora spends her days watching tV. - Her shelter. Now, all day long, and blasting, because she's almost stone deaf. It's so glorious, to reach that age. I think I won't reach old age. A gypsy told me I'll die before I reach the age of 40. - then, you still have 15 more years. - Yes, laugh if you want. I don't have crow's feet, though, and you have... - around your pretty eyes. - Crow's feet? Where? Such a cheek! He asks, and it's all he's got! - there they are! My pumpkin! - Now, stop that... you're going too far! You joke, you say you're kidding, but... Let me see the Latin lover laugh. the Latin lover, laugh, please. Stop this nonsense! Antonio, I need just one month, with Mama Cora out of the house. I asked Sergio. Now I'm asking you. take her with you, please. I can't stand this any longer. She's exhausted and nervous. I got married late in life, I used to live so happily, alone with Mom. And I married because you wanted me to have a family. Well, now I've got a family. - Do you regret it? - No, I'm very happy. But I feel so miserable. I beg you. On my knees I do. Please, just for some time, take her. I can't go on like this. they're hysterical. thanks, Mama Cora, my friend let me down today. Love, give mummy a kiss, go play while I talk to Granny. Mama Cora, if my husband comes back before I do... ...which he won't do, uh? - Who? My husband. Now, suppose he did come back early, just tell him... I had to go to the hospital. to the hospital? What are you going to do there? My mother in law was admitted. His mother. His late mother? Your mother in law? - Did I say mother? - You said his mother. - I meant his mother 's sister. - then it must be Porota. - Porota's in hospital! - No, the other sister you never met. the only one I never met is Dolores. Is she sick? No. this is a different one. She's retarded, hidden for 20 years. 20 years? She's too young! When was she born? that's because her father died before she was conceived. this one's older. Much older, Mama Cora. Don't know how old. She was born I know, when my mother in law... was pregnant with Porota. that was hard for her. two deliveries, at the same time. Mama Cora, I'm late. Please help me with this zipper. I'll help you. tuck it in. tuck it in. - Ouch! - What? Did I hurt you? - You did. - You've put on weight. Hold your breath. Hold it. Just don't say a word, Mama Cora. - Why not? My husband, he wouldn't stand the pain. A retarded sister. Don't you worry. Don't you worry. Mama Cora, it's just for 2 hours. If you get bored, watch tV, or water the plants, will you? Listen, Dominga, are you going out, in those clothes? - Yes. My dear, your things show through the fabric. - Yes. take a coat with you. It'll grow cold later on. If it gets cold have Oscar wear a jacket. - Fine, dear. - Listen, are you breast-feeding? - Yes, Mama Cora. What can I do then? I can't feed your boy. - Why not? - My breasts, Dominga. Breast feed him? Just a banana, that's all, all mashed. - A banana, ok? - Go. Give my love to Porota. Mama Cora, the jacket. It's just for 2 hours. Matildita, you love your granny, don't you? - Sure. See? She says she loves her, from the bottom of her heart. So why not put an extra bed in her bedroom? - Why not, indeed? - You said you love her. - Not in my bedroom, I don't. - You're too selfish. Granny is OK where she is now. She is not OK. You heard what Susana said. She's old and... who knows how much time she's left to live? - And if she dies in my bedroom? - too much of a diplomat, are you? Really, man, how could you make so much money, tell me. Working for the ma... Hey! Everyone says so. Listen, set the table, will you? they want to tuck granny in my bedroom! In your bedr... No! Oh, no! How? With forceps? Impossible. Don't count on my good will... ...it's not there. - OK. Stop that. I don't want any more talk of this. the ravioli are ready, and I want to have a calm, Sunday lunch, in peace. Yes, a family Sunday, calm... just as you always create. You know, Elvira, I just love coming to your house. - You do? I know. Fine. Whoever wants to wash their hands, the bathroom's... there, and if you need to do number 1 or 2, go now as well. You, get changed. Don't wear that, will you? - Wear something decent. - What do you say? Should I? Yes, men in sleeveless undershirts are too depressing to me. - Mom. We need more knives! - Come get them! What do you mean everyone is talking about it, girl. - What are we waiting for, now? - I told him to change his clothes. It's depressing enough to have to swallow her ravioli... and on top of that, see him in that ugly undershirt. - they'll hear you. You don't like her ravioli, nor her sauce, you don't... you only want to flatter her. the ravioli are too tough. they're tough. I don't know. Maybe it was the mineral water, and the bubbles, I guess. this idiot couldn't think of buying mineral water without bubbles! - I didn't know. - You never know anything. that's not it, though. the sauce, it stayed too long on the ring. - What's burning? - the house! - What will I feed you now? - Don't worry about us. Just open a can. Any can you have. I don't have any canned food. My dear. - No! I'm not going! Go buy something, Matilde! I said I won't go. Period. Listen, Matilde, go buy something... ham, cheese, pastrami, sausage, or I'll kill you. Now she'll start with the hints, trying to con you into buying... a roast chicken, for sure. - Don't be a gossip. - I know your family. My family? Want me to get started on your family? My family says nothing about your activities, my family knows how to keep their mouths shut about that. - Will you shut up? - Oh, watch it! Now, what can we do? What? - Let's enjoy this peace. - No, we need to buy something. But, where? We need to go downtown. this neighborhood is dead on Sundays. Let us eat what you have. We love overdone meat... ...and tough ravioli. - Are you out of your mind? We need to do something. Would you drive Sergio downtown? Dear, don't spend so much. Don't make me more nervous! I'm nervous enough! - Oh, sorry. - Fine. - My temper's so... - Awfully bad... Don't be mean. Come, crazy one. Ouch! - Forgotten. - Forgotten. - Do I look fine? - Fine? Fine enough to go out and buy something for lunch. You should have been more careful of your cooking! Hey, don't fly too high, you're not kite, you know? If you want to eat, go out and buy something. - If you don't, then don't go. - I can go to a restaurant. Great idea. Go wherever you want, but leave me alone. Elvira, such a beautiful Sunday, let's not spoil this day. This once, when we've got guests. They treat us like royalty... ...whenever they invite us. - they have a maid! Of course! Nora will not even wet the tip of her fingers to do anything. Anyone can do that, with a maid! Why didn't you buy sardines, or chips, olives, nothing! Just to have a snack! Don't you shout at me, or I'll go to the convent nearby and ask for shelter there! Yes! If there's a victim here, it's not exactly you, babe! No, no, I'm leaving. I don't want this sort of Sunday. It has to do with habits. At my parents' home, there was never any shouting. Not even to say "good morning'. You're all lovable, of course, lovable you are, but... Antonio. Nora, what, now? Come. Let's play with your tricycle. Come, come. Show me how you play. Come on. - Nora, don't be foolish. - I'm not foolish. I hate violence, that's all. Unfortunately, I'm not sensitive, I'm hyper-sensible. this kills me, my nerves are not made of steel. I fall apart. - Is she here? - Who? - Mama Cora. Is she here? - No. Did she say she'd come? She's gone. She left the baby alone, the door open. She's gone. - She left your house? - Where can she be? - Where can she have gone? - Now you worry? I knew this serpent would have evil thoughts! Nobody kicked her out! Aren't those...? Yes, they are. - Poor lady. - Maybe she went to Emilia's. Don't stand there! Get the car and go find here. - Let's go. - I'll come with you. No. they are not. though maybe they are... yes. Would you take me home, I left the baby on her own. No, they're not them. No. they were. Yes, they were. though I can't tell. they might have been. there he is, the moron! Me? Cacho! - You're Cacho, aren't you? - Uh? - We're you uncles. Remember us. - Ah. - Moron! - Son of a bitch! You fags, now you'll see. this one's a free lesson, son of a bitch! Oh, son of a bitch! Seen your grandma? - Hey, hey! Stop! - Stop! Son of a bitch! - Stop! - Wait ttill I have my way with you. Hey, relax. Listen, seen your grandmother? - Which one? - My mother. Your Mum's mother. Incredible! Don't you know what a grandmother is? - Where's your Mum? - Went to buy some food. Listen, as soon as she comes back, tell her to phone uncle Sergio. - Fag! - Who? Uncle Sergio? - Hey, stop it! - Son of a bitch. they" re all sons of bitches. You'll see, now. Come over here. Damn phone. Dead, again! - Relax, Elvira. they'll come back. - No. this fucking phone won't do this to me. Hello! I pick up the phone and the line goes dead! And it's expensive! I'm getting nervous. Dear Elvira, I beg you. One last try. It's ringing. Hello. Oh, sorry, sir, would you be so kind as... to get Mrs. Emilia for me. It's very urgent. I beg your pardon? Can't hear you! tough luck. You're a true gentleman. - What did he say? - Said he wouldn't go. Hope he chokes on his food, hope they take him to the hospital, half dead. Mama Cora is sure to be at Emilia's... and the guys will have gone to buy some food, for sure. - I'm hungry. - tough luck! Why don't you open the package of pastries? You want some, auntie? Ok. though pastries and I don't get along too well. - Aren't you eating? - Uh, I'll eat. Yes. - What is it with you? - Go to the kitchen! If they notice we're eating... before hearing about the old hag, they"II say we are heartless. - So? - Nothing, so far. I hope, for your own sake, nothing bad has happened to her. - What do you mean? - It would be your fault, and I wouldn't be in your shoes then. Blame's a burden. that's it. - that...! - No! Enough! 629 - Nothing. - Leonor hasn't seen her, either. too bad, guys. too bad! You know what they had for lunch? - Empanadas. - three. Broke my heart! three empanadas, left over from yesterday, for 2! Heavens! there's not much you can do for people. Yes. Only thin you can do is not even think about them. Otherwise... Don't think. Don't think. It's a good thing my brothers have all bare necessities covered. Well, I wouldn't say that much. - Yours is poverty with dignity. - What about Jorge? And Emilia? they know what it is to be poor! Yes, but their poverty has... dignity! YOU'RE ENtItLED tO LIVING IN FREEDOM - Who's looking after the baby? - Ever since I met you, Elvira, when Jorge first brought me to this house, I said to myself... - Stop it! Shit! - I didn't start! Let her finish! What was it you thought... the first time Jorge brought you here for dinner? - Want to hear it? Sure? - My curiosity is killing me. Well, I thought: this is the falsest, fakest woman on earth! - False? Me? Ha! - Who's looking after the baby? I'm false, and you are... can't even label you, imagine! You're false! You didn't say a word! I'd have told you! For my part, I didn't keep it in, I told Jorge: Are you marrying this? this? this one will place horns on your head a month after the wedding. Didn't I tell you so? Or did I? Matilda, bring the pastries, give some to your uncle and aunt. All insults here. What's got into your heads? - Want one, auntie? - No! Don't do that! Clean the carpet, now! Why did you say I'd place horns on his head... ...a month after the wedding? - Susana, that was 4 years ago. - Who can think of that? - She does! And I feel I'm entitled to knowing why she said so. You are. And I will tell you. First, because I can talk. Second, because this is a free, sovereign country, with freedom of speech, no censorship, and so on... And third, because I just felt like it. If I took the three foolish things you just said, and said only one... little think I know, you would stop talking so freely... - about other people, dear. - What do you know about me? Speak! But first, use some bleach to wash your mouth, because... I've done nothing wrong in my 18 years of marriage. - Are you sure? - What do you think? You think you can put a stain on my name, as you did with the carpet! Don't stand there, like a Greek mummy, Nora and Matilde will... What were you going to say? Nothing. Oh, no, no. Now you won't say it's nothing. As if you were hiding some horrible secret! - Spit it out, if you know something! - Stop it, you parrots! - Your godmother's a parrot! - Oh, my curtain! Susana, for the third time now... - who's looking after the baby? - My mother in law. Oh, great! And how' s your beautiful, wonderful mother? - So, so. - Oh, is she? I haven't seen her for so long. And I love her so much. tell me. Is she happy with the baby? Well, the baby means work. She gets upset... because she cries so much and you can't tell what's wrong with her. - She won't stop. - Sure. Know what? She's exercising her lungs, you know, dear. Nature's wise, in that sense. - It's a shame! - How could you invent that? No. Not Elvira. Impossible! With whom? With whom? - I know with whom. - Shush. Enough, ok? But... this is a delicate matter. What about her? She says I'll be unfaithful, can she say so? What? Listen, she's very peculiar. too nervous, you know. Now, are you sure of this? I can't believe it. I swear I can't. - So don't believe it! - Does Sergio know? Don't pay attention to her, she's lying, inventing this up out of spite. No, no, no. Susan's honest, I know. She wouldn't invent such a thing to harm an innocent person. Aren't you honest, sweetie? No, if she says something... it's because she's got proof. I don't know many honest persons, so honest... with a sense of justice. I truly admire you, haven't I told you so? I admire you, I swear. tell me. What a headache! the towel! the towel! Ah... - Come in. Hello. - Hello. - take a seat. How are you, Peralta? - Here I am. Can't you see me? the dentist's drill is not a prodder. It's to help you feel well. - Where's Barrionuevo? - Not in on Sundays. - Vallejo? - What? Haven't you heard? - What? - In jail. Drug dealing. - Shit! - And this one? this is my brother, Sergio. Listen, what about that guy...? that officer was Vallejo's right hand. - Cano, was it? - Cano, Cano. In jail, too. there are too many going to jail these days. How can I help you? - Name? - Mama Cora. Dolores! - Ana Mar?a! - De los Dolores. - Buscaroli... - de Musicardi. What did I say? Excuse me. Why did you say her name was Mama Cora. Well, everyone calls her Mama Cora, her parents, her siblings... everyone calls her so. And her children, now. Ana Mar?a de los... Dolores... Last name? Buscaroli de Musicardi. Age? - 80? - thereabouts. What do you mean, thereabouts? I need to write down her age. What difference does it make? 75, 80, it's the same. Well, maybe 77, 78. I guess. I can phone my wife and ask. - Jorge would know. - Well, age unknown, I'll write. - Oldish. - Her clothes? - Of course she's wearing clothes! - What color, I meant? de los Dolores Buscaroli de... as Mama Cora, from partial amnesia... Were I not right here, I'd think I was there. - So? - We filed an announcement. At Emilia's they know nothing. Uncle Agust?n knows nothing. - Nobody knows anything. - Brought lunch? Matilde, you should ask about your granny, first. - Did you go see cousin Felipe? - No! Never thought about that! - Matilde, the phone book. - Yes, come on. - Did she have any money with her? - Where would she get money? What? You never give her any? What about Elvira? - She's lying down. Feeling faint. - What's the matter with her? - Nothing. - Felipe. this is Sergio. Who's Sergio? What cousin? What mother? What aunt? there's no aunt here. Who is it? Sergio? Who's Sergio? Hey, know a Sergio? Mom! Mom! Know a Sergio? Everyone knows a Sergio. Hello, what number...? - He hung up, shit... - Sergio! Cora's son! Why didn't you tell me it was Cora's son? Wasn't it a good idea to come out of hell for a while? We should have ordered something else. A cool drink, maybe? Brandy, liqueur, whisky? - Cold beer? - No. It's on me, dear, just order. - It's fine. Whatever. I can't believe what you said about Elvira, dear. I won't talk about that, Nora. Don't waste your time. - Susana. - Oh, I saw you coming! Susana! But, Susana... You asked me out for coffee, just to talk about this. Come on, Nora! But you're wrong, I don't speak. When you have a tumor, you have to take it out. And if you have a secret that distresses you... How can whatever this woman does or did distress me? - It's an old story. - A story, just that! Well, if you don't want to talk, don't. But... Look, we're such good friends. I'm offended by your attitude. Do you think I'm capable of spreading rumor? Why not? You're not handicapped, not tongue handicapped, especially. Oh, fine, darling. We'll show our real faces, then. I know what you think about me. Why do you want to know who Elvira slept with? - to see what kind of woman she is. - Come on, Nora. We women don't change if we cheat or we don't. You see, you have an affair with Sergio, and you're the same to me. How dare you say something like that? How dare you say something like that?! Look, I won't forgive you while I'm alive. Not ever. I won't forgive you while... Oh! I've known it for two years, and never told a soul. - Susana. I swear I didn't, Susana. - Don't you swear. You're playing with two persons' reputation, two families' and their peace are in your hands. I saw you coming out of an apart hotel with Sergio. - that's a lie! Don't repeat that because I'll sue you! Dark glasses and a shawl on your head. Hands off me! I don't want you to touch me! I don't judge you, Nora. I'm not happy with my marriage either. But, how can you insist on that? You saw 2 years ago a woman, with black glasses, a black shawl, a black cape... - I never mentioned a black cape. - Yes, you did. No! I didn't... Yes, I remember now! - You wore a black cape! - But, it's over! Hello. Yes, speaking. - Where? - What happened? Who's this? - Mummy. - But, what happened? Yes, sure. Of course. But, man, please, what's this, a thriller? talk now! An old woman threw herself under a train in Villa Luro. We have to go to the Morgue to identify the body. Mummy. Oh, I hope it's not her, my God. Hope it's not her. - I hope it is her. - Mum! I hope it is! So she regrets it all, and suffers as is fit for her evil. So? Has she shown up? Your brothers went to the Morgue to identify an old woman' s body... she threw herself under the train in Villa Luro. No peace for the young. Damn the old woman, son of a bitch! Emilia. Mom! Oh! Huy! Oh! Eee! She's a mess. I recognize these, they are Mom's shoes. they are Mom's shoes! Let's see, let's see, eat your food, ah? Let's see, open your mouth. See how nice. that's nice. You have to eat, to grow up in good health, you know? I always ask the Virgin. Let's see, another one. Oh, that's fine. I ask the Virgin, but our Lady of Luj?n. I don't go to Lourdes any more. I used to go, always. I brought the holy water from there, to drink with my mate. But the last time I got diarrhea. I remembered that Virgin, oh, yes, I did. She heals you on this side, but she fucks you on that one. talking that way of me! Me, so faithful I'm even stupid! And I say stupid, because... if there's something I would ever regret, is to have been so pure, so na?i?ve, all my life. Haven't I always told you? Happy women are those, who cheat and are unfaithful, in a big way. Well, tell her to her face. With Matilde here! My kid, she looks like a young lady, but she's only 15, a baby. - 16. - 15! No, no right at all to do that. I can't now... I don't know. You spend your day, trying to teach somebody something, as good as possible, ah? And then a disgraceful bitch comes up and, and in the blink of an eye, makes it all fall apart. No right to do that. But, with whom? Who would I cheat Sergio with? Can you tell me? I swear by my holy mother's memory, look, by this cross, I swear, I never cheated on Sergio. Not even in my thoughts, listen carefully to what I say. Let me die if I'm lying! Let this roof come down on me. Let the abyss of hell open. - Mom! I'mjust saying it for you to have an idea, of how much, peace of mind I can enjoy. Instead, she can't say the same, no, sir. What can you expect of a servant's daughter... ...and her father a waiter. - No, not that! there are respectable maids. My Dad was a waiter, his entire life! - But that... Oh, of course! No, I didn't mean that. No, I'm sorry! Hey, Elvira, someone hushes from that balcony. Do you think I don't hear that? Don't listen to her, I can't stand her. - She's an old woman. - the least we should, then. I can't deal with old women now. What that old woman had to go through, it has no name. Yes. Making her go, as if she was a dog with rabies! Have you ever seen something like this? But, what are we? Niggers? Indians? Wild people? Or Jews? With no religious beliefs? No, God will never forgive her. I hope it is the old woman, the one from under the train. Poor, sweet and darling Mama Cora. So sweet she was, so helpful, so useful. So useful, so willing to help, remember? She worked like a beast all day long, poor old lady. No, she doesn't deserve forgiveness! Now, if sins aren't punished on Earth, they are in Heaven, or Hell, I don't know. Somewhere I think. - Surely. - Don't know. I can only think about thanking God I got an education... in a Catholic, Apostolic, Romanic home, and, one of these days, God will call her to face Him, and will make her pay her sins, one by one. Because if there is something I do believe in, it's God and justice. Oh yes, the Church is such great comfort. - Really. Once I get the Judge's permission... ...you will be able to take her... - to my house, of course. - You'll see how she does that. - Who? - Susana. - Whom? Whom? the old lady. You'll see she brings the body home. - Would she dare? - Yes, and she will. But, you don't know her. But, you don't know me either, ah? I can take the body and throw it out the window... along with Susana and all the stuff. they won't laugh at me! Such a tragedy! I tell you... I'm grief stricken It's so horrible to live surrounded by stupid, ignorant, non educated... people. Brutes! the parrot crapped on me. My husband, he did like wine. My God. When he drank he got bad. He used to hit me. So many times, bastard. What a personality! But it was the wine, the wine got the best of him. He was a good guy. Deep inside, my kids and myself, we have nothing to complain about. We had everything we needed. We had nothing to eat sometimes, that's true. But, he treated me as if I were a queen, and my kids, as if they were princes. No one can say he didn't. there are no men like that now. Honey... What do you mean, "who is it"? I say honey and you answer "who is it"? Oh, I'm sorry, Sergio, I'm too nervous and didn't recognize you. Of course you and only you call me honey. But... Now I realize you never called me that way. Now, tell me, what happened? No! But, no... No, really? Really...? tell me. But no, Sergio, no. that's awful! Is it the old woman? But tell me, can't we hold the wake over there? Here? But Sergio, the kid is so sensitive. Yes, love. I know how you feel. Of course it was your mother. I feel bad too. Imagine, it grieves me, too. But... We're nothing, see? too bad! Oh, listen, before I forget. Susana won't set a foot in this house! Not even one! Is it clear? tell me, do these procedures take too long? Well, fine. See you later darli... Oh and, my deepest sympathy. they are bringing her here! I knew it, ah? - And where would it to? - How would I know? Where she was kicked out, your aunt's? Go eat a bite before they arrive, you won't be able to eat later. What are you doing? Oh, yes. Elvira, don't do this to me! She's lived with me all these years. She did, for better or worse, she did. Elvira! Mom didn't know what she was doing! Nora! Nora, what a tragedy! Can you imagine my life, after this tragedy? I can. Calvary, as it should be. You don't know what happened. Don't do this to me! - What are we doing? - What? Antonio and Sergio say that as Mum was not happy with me, I'm not entitled to hold the wake in my house. I think it's sensible. When all is said and done, you realize that's... - why she killed herself, didn't she? - Oh, did she? then I'll kill myself as well! I won't live through this day! I can't stand people who... Yeah, now he thinks of his good name, see? - Shut up, you snake! - You see? Nora? - Gossip! Hag! - Now you see... what I must put up with, don't you? You're the eldest and are entitled to more than your siblings. Oh, now you remember your rights. too bad... you never thought of your duty when you kicked the poor lady out... Who kicked her out? Heavens! Who kicked her out! Susana was making mayonnaise... Stop the crap with that mayonnaise story! try to remember, you wanted someone to take her off... your hands for some time, ok? Well, God heard your prayers and now He's taken her off... your hands for a long time. Forever, oh, yes, He did. - What's your problem now? - She's lived with me all these years. And she'll go to her final resting place, but out my own door! - Sergio's her son as well. - So is Antonio. - Are they? Since when? - For everyone to know it. Yes, but when did they ever behave as her sons? tell me. - I'm not talking to you. - Neither am I. Who needs you? Fine with me! Now, if you don't need me, why did you come? Who called you? Did I? to my own misfortune? You heard me call her? We came because we thought you're the man of the house here, and because we know your heart is as hard as a stone. You, of all people, talk about my heart? You, who had no qualms... about sending that poor martyr to her lethal end? And all because she spoiled your stupid mayonnaise? You? And you dare talk about my heart? I've cried myself sick today, and all because of you. - Hypocrite! Girls, show some respect for the poor old lady" s soul. Sure! Some respect. Leave her alone. She's dead now. You charlatan! Why don't you stick your nose in your own... business instead of meddling? - In whose business, I ask? - Nora and Sergio's, I mean! Want a punch in the nose? What's up with Nora and Sergio? Dear, how could you make up such a story? I can't help laughing. - Bad timing, though! - What did she mean? that Sergio and you...? - Our girl, Elvira! - the girl. What are you doing here? Go, go! You're always listening to us grownups talk! Shit! What do you mean? Let's go, Jorge. Don't want to explain it to her with a drawing... ...to show her what I mean. - No! No way! You're not leaving! You tossed the stone and now... you want to back away. You won't. How can you take it seriously? People say silly things in times like these. Besides, Elvira, think of the poor old lady. - Which one? - Mama Cora. - Who? Mama Cora! - Of course, poor thing. How could you take offense by something Susana says... in such a sorry state! I forgive her! there! Does that set an example? I should be offended, more... than anyone, and I forgive her. So I wear the horns, and you feel hurt! My! Worse things have happened here. Much worse, mind you! I'm sorry, Elvira. I made up that lie out of spite, that's all. Let's not bring this up again. Words are just words... ...gone with the wind. - Not for me! Get out of this house, right now, to the count of five! - What shall we do with Mom? - Listen, your mother... - Easy, easy. - Let go of me! Out of here! Is the room ready? Dear Mummy is already here! - Antonio! - Nora! - Sergio! - Elvira! It hurts so much! So much! Awful! Brother! Sergio, such a tragedy! Matilde, Granny" s dead! Dear Granny's dead! - Antonio! - Nora! Sergio, let the wake take place in my house, please. No! Get out of here! - We'll take her home! - No! - Out of here! Get out! - No! Why are you doing this? the wake will be in my house! Antonio! In my house! - Easy, calm down. - No! Mom's wake will be at home! - She's my Mom! the wake...! - Stop it! Mom will be unloaded here. Help me, Antonio. Help me. - No! thieves! Usurpers! - Get out of here! Mom robbers! No, my Mummy, no! Come on, Antonio. - Help me, Antonio! - take him out! - Excuse me. ...Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed are you among women... I'm coming... to pray with the old lady... Baby, what can we do? Life's too short! What can we do? Blood pressure's too low. that's why I need a drink. Besides... I'm dehydrated. It's too hot in here. My throat's parched. - Is there a corpse here? - A dead old lady. Hey, show some respect! Stupid brat! - Where shall I leave this? - Over there. No, sorry. Dead people scare me too much. My condolences, if you don't mind. I'll give this to you. My angel, don't cry. You'll cry yourself sick, dear. Why did you put her in my bedroom? - Matilde! Dead people are too scary! - She's your grandmother. - She's a corpse, anyway. Shut up, will you? Otherwise, I'll give you my blessing. What are you doing there? Not expecting a tip, I hope. On such a sad day, are you? - What to go in? - No, madam. - No trouble at all. - thank you, madam. - Oh, come on. Go in there. - No, madam. It's no trouble, I tell you. Do me a favor, go in... just for the sake of having some audience here. Nobody came. Dora and Alfonsina. Who's that boy who went in just now? I have no idea. He brought the flower arrangement. He's so scared. It's so hot in there! Yes, too hot! Now, have you seen that snake's tears? the hypocrite! Well, who wouldn't cry, Elvira? I'm dehydrated, I tell you. You're right. Only a stone would be able not to cry today. Oh, Do?a Gertrudis. Do?a Gertrudis! Don Genaro! this is such a tragedy! - I can't believe it. - Who can? You've met Antonia Gertrudis, Matilde's French teacher. Nora, my sister in law. - I can't believe it! - Nobody can believe it. - Such a terrible loss! - Such a saint! We've lost another saint, our world is the poorer for it! She had such talent for French. talent for French? She was talented in all walks of life! Don't you worry, Do?a Gertrudis, because I'm sure that now... she's sitting right by God's throne. that's what we're all wondering about. Go see her, she'll be so happy to see you! Go, please. take this, if you're so kind, please. Poor Madame Cora. I said throne, didn't it? I'm all messed up today! ...don't know what I say. - Yes, throne was all right, dear. to think of this. It was only yesterday that you got married. Only yesterday Petite Emilia was born. Petite Emilia... you'll hear all sorts of nonsense today, uh? Heard that? the old hag was almost 80 already. What did they expect? She couldn't live to be 100! Listen, I don't want to get that old. I'd rather commit suicide! - It's what she did. - Yeah, right, what she did. - Mom, may I go to Pocha' s? - You may not. What will people say? Stay, baby, and cry a little bit. Cry. Don't you have a sense of propriety? She takes after the Musicardis! tough, selfish, so hard they would rather die. Instead, my side, the Romero's we're all so sensitive. I'd rather be like they are. You don't suffer as much, I say. Now, this one, she'll never let anyone fool around with her. - Go to my room, dear. - I don't want to. Go lie on my bed and cry. Go. Poor thing. She breaks my heart. What can I say? You know people are mean, oh, yes, they are so mean! What will people say if I let her stay here? that she's happy and doesn't care her grandmother's dead? Come on, hurry up. Come, come. At Daddy's wake, there was such a crowd, I tell you. Everyone loved Daddy. Now, on a Sunday, and in summer. People go to Mar del Plata. We would've been more successful if the old hag had waited... until winter, and on a week day. Sergio has so many friends. - Sh. It doesn't look good. - We needed some fresh air. It's stifling in there. Wait a minute! What' s our dear sister in law doing? - She's crying. - So fake! He doesn't know a word of it. You know what she insinuated? that you and Nora have an affair. Let her say whatever she wants. I'm at peace with my conscience. Women! How can you start gossiping on such a day... ...such a sad day? - Who's gossiping? I don't care what Susana says or invents! - Don't you see I'm grieving? - What about me? I grieve, too. Is my heart made of stone? - Elvira! - Do?a Elisa! What do you think of this tragedy? there's no room for grudges at times like this. I brought the water, for the ravioli. So sweet! thanks! Here, dear, take it to the kitchen. Oh, Elvira. - My condolences. - thank you, Do?a Elisa. My condolences. But, why would she ever do such a thing? that's what we all want to know? Why did you do this, Mama Cora? - Such a pure soul. - So pure, so exquisite. Life's so short, it's nor worthwhile. No, not worthwhile. Go, Do?a Elisa, do go see her. Mama Cora's soul will find comfort in your presence. Where's Matilde? Liked the pastries? You'll see. Matilde's in my room, poor sweet little girl, she's grieving. Go sit with her, will you, dear? - Hey, that's nice outfit! - Like it? Look like a movie star. So pretty! Such a horrible creature. She takes after her father, poor thing. Nora, I need an aspirin. My head is bursting, I swear. And I'll make some coffee. What a day! Susana had to talk about us today, of all days! - If Antonio were to hear of it. - My poor brother, it'd be too bad. - I love him so much. - Yes, so do I. Now, your wife is not exactly an example of discretion. Who would be? When it comes to unfaithfulness. Some say she cheated on you. She never did! She never did! And such a good father, too. If it took kicking Antonio in the head to stop his crying... then kicked it would be. If it took starving Jorge, starve he would. Once, he let him go without any food for three whole days. If it took locking Sergio up in the back room, locked up he would be. In our days, it was that way. He never had second thoughts. that's why out sons ended up being so righteous, so religious. It's terrible. Jorge will never forgive me. He will. He's a poor guy, he's got no strength at all. - I can't forgive myself. - Well, that's a different story. If you feel guilty... What do you do to silence your guilty feeling? Your regret? Me? Nothing. I do my duty. try not to be unfair. I'm the least guilty of us three, and I feel so guilty, so bad. Why the least guilty? You're as innocent as I am. Elvira, I wouldn't want to hurt you, but you know, Sergio and you are living in this house... Mama Cora's house. And this is her furniture! Hello. this is his wife. What? What? What are you saying? Listen, sir, you're talking nonsense, so... please, speak clearly. I can't understand what you say! Spit what you have in your mouth and speak more clearly. Will you repeat that? Is this a joke? Well, it wouldn't be the first time, you know? It's a shame! On such a day! But, sir... I can hear you! No, to tell the truth I never even checked. Now, if her own sons, blood of her own blood, flesh of her own flesh, didn't realize... - What is it we didn't realize about? - It's the wrong corpse. that corpse is an intruder! Hello! - She was wearing identical shoes. - Well, look, sir... have her picked up at once, ok? We're been mourning this intruder all day long here. And in my daughter 's bedroom! And crying ourselves sick, too! You don't fool around with people's feelings, you know? Son of a... - What was that? - What's going on? What, you say? You got the wrong corpse, you stupid asses! What do you mean? they brought the wrong corpse? How could we do that? What are you doing, Emilia? I want my Mum! Mum! that lady's Hungarian, left a letter for the police before killing... herself. - But those were Mom's shoes. Can you tell your mother by the shoes? What a family! And all of us, here, crying like a bunch of idiots! - Where is my mother? - Who can tell? - Where? - Such idiots! Only an idiot would mistake a corpse! What's a corpse, I mean? Some kind of package? - I won't sleep there any more! - You shut up. I won't shut up. Such a tragedy! I just heard! Why did you come, Mom? I told you to stay at home! - Why did Cora do that? - Listen, now. Cora... - this is the last straw. She's deaf! - Where's my dear friend? Your friends ok. the lady in that coffin is a... Why do I bother? She's deaf! - Where's my friend? - I'm telling you your friend... She's not... she's Hungarian... - Where's my friend? - We don't know! We don't! In there, that lady is... Oh, what the heck. Go, go, then! - But, where's my friend? - Feel like crying for a while? then go, suit yourself, madam. Hey, what shall we do now? Have someone take this Hungarian corpse our of my baby's bedroom! Let's not rush. It might have been a practical joke. What happened to you? What have they done to you? Who did this? What's the phone number for the local police precinct? - I have it. - Useless tears, wasted! Wasted grief. Why wouldn't that Hungarian lady stay in Hungary... those communists, they are all starving! Poor Mum, if it were her! She can't even have a peaceful wake, poor thing! - Some are born with a lucky star... - And some are so unlucky. Well, don't you cry, please. Pull yourself together, will you? Hello. this is Antonio Musicardi. Is it Angel? - What is it? - Call the Chief Inspector, please. - Please, make some room. - Show some respect. - then call Menendez, please. What? What about Fortunato? Listen, I need some information here. Who's in charge? Someone should be in charge. Went to check. Move, hey, please. - Make some room. Ask for Benigno, that friend of yours, the high-rank officer. - Been in jail for the past 4 months. - Benigno? Hello. Benigno? Hi! When did you come out of jail? Congratulations! Listen, man, we phoned today... about an old lady, who went missing. Yes, today, in the afternoon. Now, two hours later, they phoned us to say she was in the morgue. Dead, of course, yes. Don't cry, please! We went to the morgue, and identified the body, by the shoes. She threw herself under a train. Imagine what she looked like. Be brief, make the long story short. Yes, Benigno. they also telling me to be brief, here. In short, after a lot of comings and goings, procedures, and... contacting influential people, we brought here to my brother 's house. Now, 4 hours into the wake, your people phoned us, yes, your people, talked to my sister in law, and they told her... the dead lady in this coffin is not my mother, but a Hungarian lady. Yes, yes, Hungarian. How can I tell why she came to our country? there's many Hungarians. Do me a favor, because if we've been holding a wake, for a foreigner we don't even know, it's been a waste, you know? Would you check? Yes, thanks. Went to check. - Make some room, please. - He's right. Don't stay in here! Go out! Move, please! - Maybe it's not Mum. - tough luck, isn't it? I was born this way, I can never do anything right. You complain? Want me to tell you about my life? No need, Jorge! It's too hot! - that's my life! Pissed by dogs! - How rude! Hello. Benigno? Oh, I see... Isn't there anyone...? You positively sure? And some other... we could? Fine, fine. thanks, man. And I'm glad you're out! Justice prevails. Bye, Benigno. - So? - So? they know nothing about a Hungarian lady. So many low-lives in this world! Well, let's go on with the wake. Nothing happened here. Go, go over there! Hail Mary... Hail Mary, ...full of grace. ...full of grace. - the Lord is with you... - the Lord is with you... - I'm back, Mama Cora. - You scared me! I'm sorry to be so late! I had to run! - What are you doing? - Bunch of flowers? - From the trash? Why? - Don't know. All I know is that across the street, in Sergio's house, there's some kind of party. this sounds weird, Mama Cora. there's lots of people. Yes, ever since this morning. I saw Gertrudis go in, and Felipe... and Rosaura, Nora, Antonio. Know who came, too? Susana and Jorge, and they don't like Sergio and Elvira, not a bit! And they're there! they came! Why didn't they invite you? It's my fault, dear. I'm too patient. I never demand. Not ever. All I did was give, give and give... give them everything. I even gave them my cooking pots, and even my sheets, the ones I got for my wedding. You gave them the sheets. And they took them. Mama Cora, you're too good, and they take you for granted. they" re so... - See? What can I do? I'm their mother. - And a mother 's a mother. - A mother like you are. I'd place you on my night table. - How did my little one behave? - the little one? Who? - the boy. - Oh, you have a boy, Dominga? I'm so glad for you! Don't go into such trouble for us, on such a day. No trouble at all. Sugar? - three, please. - You? Nora? - No sugar for me, please. You watch your weight, dear. Now, I, I tell you... Oh, it's so hot...! Must have broken all records! - Can you doubt it? - What's the good of living? Yeah. Shit! What's the good of living? I feel like crying. Well, cry then. It's a relief. No, I won't. So as not to scare my little girl. But I have to make an effort to keep calm, not to cry... think I'll develop a hernia. A mother's life is all about sacrifice. And then, your children won't even say thanks. they"II kick... - your ass. Out! ...your buttocks, you mean. Well. Breed ravens... Of course, those beasts will eat your eyes... but they're just beasts. they don't know. Now, a son... if there's a hell, it must be paved with sons. Is there? Do?a Elisa, I don't doubt it. I'm positive all there is Hell, just that. - Elvirita. - What do you think of this tragedy! - Mama Cora! - Cora! - My daughters... - Mama Cora! What are you doing here? Who's the dead one, then? Not there. - What do we do now, Nora? - to your bedroom. Yes. Come with me, Mama Cora. this old hag is out of her mind! Someone's crying in Matilde's bedroom. - No! - It's the television. - She had a tV set? - No. the neighbor's tV, I mean! Come, Mama Cora. Matilde, dear, look. What a surprise! Matilde! Matilde! - What is it? - What is it? that phone call, they must have been right. Elvira, don't pay any attention to that call, and let... poor Cora have a peaceful wake. the peaceful wake is for that Hungarian hag! Mama Cora is in my bedroom. - What? - Mummy! Mother! What a Sunday! Heavens! What a Sunday! What a Sunday! - Mummy! - Mum! My dear old Mum! It's so nice to have the whole family here, with me! - they" re coming for her. - For whom? - the dead woman. - this one? - Yes. - At long last. Listen, ...please take care of that. - No! Yes. Listen, have them take her out through the window, ok? Have the men come in through the window as well. I don't want Mama Cora to see this! Imagine, we might lose her now we're so happy to have her back! that would be terrible! Sir! What was that? I heard... Isn't that Felipe? Heavens! It's a warning! I'll give up drinking! - Madame Cora! - Gertrudis! What a nice surprise! And those flowers! - they" re for you, Madame Cora. - For me? Why? What's today? Someone's birthday? - Where were you all day long? - Just across the street... in Dominga's house, remember her? All day long? Yes, because Jorge and Susana were too nervous today, so, I didn't want to be a nuisance, and I went out for a couple of hours. Quickly! Get them out! Listen. Why did Matilde scream when she saw me? - As if I were a ghost. - No, no. What are these people doing here? We came to pick you up, to go to a wake. - Who's dead? - A poor Hungarian lady. What a terrible tragedy! Why did she kill herself? I can imagine what you feel. I love old people as much as you do. I feel passion for old people. You know, I think I met a Hungarian lady once. - that was a long time ago. - Maybe it's the same one. Maybe. Maybe. then, we should go, don't you think so? Life's so short. Elvira! Such a terrible loss! Have you seen this? Ask her for the address. Mama Cora was a friend of her mother's. Tell me, where will you be holding the wake? the address? For the wake? the wake? Where will it be? Hey, the wake...! - Where's the dear late friend? - What dear late friend? I fell asleep, right beside the coffin. - What coffin? - Oh, dear! Oh, dear! - Here's the address. - Whose address? - the Hungarian's! Go, go. Hurry up, maybe... you'll have fun for a while, and find a good seat. Go, dear lady, go. What a terrible tragedy. that poor woman, she... just told me. the poor Hungarian's daughter. - Au revoir, my dear. We'll expect you tomorrow, for the French lesson. - Bye, Nora. Don't you start saying goodbye to everyone now. It'll take forever! Go, go. Go, Mama Cora, go. Have a nice time. God bless you all. Elvira, my daughter went out with Matilde. When she comes... ...please tell her to go home. - Can't I borrow her? For tonight? Please. So she can be with dear Matilde. My little girl won't want to sleep by herself in that room. Ok, fine. Have her. I'll let her father know. Fine. Go, go. there. I mean. Do you thing... it's the same Hungarian lady? Of course, Mama Cora. Not a doubt about that. Hey, Nora, Nora. Why don't we plan something... for next Sunday, ok? Let's have some fun. We get along pretty well, don't we? - What are you laughing at? - I'm laughing at you! At all of us. that's the joke. < I have a milking cow, TO OUR DEAR ELDERLY PARENtS
