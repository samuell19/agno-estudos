The film was made with the assistance of donations. 35,086 people helped. The memories of war are not just pain and sadness. And yes, the battles and acts of heroism are trademarks of victory! "Ivan Panfilov - Commander of its 316th Marine Division." November 14, 1941, year one. Psychological preparation is the most important. You do not need a lot of strength. Courage is good, but... it is not the most important. I need tractor drivers. There are few people who know. Are there any tractor drivers here? "You're not the only one." Did you not hear? Why do you not answer? Excuse me, Comrade Lieutenant. - Not paying attention? - Shut up. Did you hear the lieutenant's question? - I heard. - Then up. - Are you a tractor driver? - I'm a mechanic. That's not what we need. - I thought you milked cows. - You're an... I can drive a tractor. I ran a scythe. Tractors and harvesters are more or less alike. OK. But what I do know is how to fix them. You will learn to destroy them, not fix them. The technology of their tanks differs from ours. I will show you some basic things that I noticed in them. This is a tank of 10 tons. Able to cross a lake. In profile, it looks like this. It has four pairs of wheels. So it is easy to recognize it. There is a dome on the turret. - What is the gun's caliber? - 37 mm. - Holy shit... - And two machine guns. 7.92 mm caliber. Here and here. The famous "MG". They use it in all types of combat. And a good weapon, but it requires a lot of maintenance. If you do not wash your hands after shitting it just jams. True. It is a good machine gun, but it must always be clean, otherwise it obstructs. Red Army soldiers... Moskalenko, is that right? Exactly. Moskalenko soldier. You talk too much, soldier. His conversation is disturbing. There might be time left, but I do not have any. I'm sorry, I just wanted to raise the morale of the soldiers. This assignment is not yours. It is a commissioner's job. You are the political commissar? No. He's our commissioner. That's right. Political Commissar, Klochkov. Klochkov, you are the only one in the Division? Yes I am. - I've heard about you. - They are rumors, do not listen to them. Do not get mad, Lieutenant. Moskalenko talks too much. But he has already shown bravery on the front. So do not punish him. Bravery in battle is always welcome, but here he should close his noisemaker. Exactly. Talk less, Ivan Moskalenko. The Lieutenant already has too many problems to deal with. Excuse me. The machine gun is not an "MG", it is Czech and uses the same ammunition. The shield is weak. You could rupture it at a distance of 300 to 400 meters, if you use an anti-tank rifle. It burns like a torch. But I do not think they will attack with this thing. For the front line you must use the larger screen. However, it is good to know all kinds. Yes, Comrade Colonel! Understood. They are not yet ready, but we can do a demonstration. Understood. Understood, Comrade Colonel! Of course I can do it. Understood. Stasenko, is the horse ready? You ready, comrade Kombat. Do you recognize this? Of course, but I prefer brandy. It gives me a hangover. Before they used it for other purposes. Now, look. Has no pin, only a wick. They are ready to use. But there is a downside. If it breaks in your hand, you will die burned. So use it carefully. Just do not drink the grenade before using it. Moskalenko, get some more bottles. Can they be of any type? - Preferably with a stopper. - OK. - ASAP. - It's all right. - Get a helper. - Come on, Petruha. Get a move on, guys! Listen, Petruha... The best way is to pour everything into a couple of buckets, or else, drink it all... We will not have more time to rest, just work. - Piotr Vasily! - Yes? Convene officers for a meeting at 18:00 hours. Yes sir, I will bring everyone here. The guide device goes here in this hole. That's it! Talk to us, Sengirbaev. What is the thickness of the armor? Armor? 30 mm. That's it. And this here, Nazarov? It is also 30 millimeters. The armor is the same. It's just fine here and here. Only at those points will the grenade take effect. In theory, they are well... Let's get practical training. Come on, Moskalenko. It's your turn. Go to the miners and bring the necessary material. Understood, Comrade Lieutenant. What material? To build a German tank in full size. - Bring everything you can. - What should I bring? I'll write it for you. Bring it fast. We have to train you today. "It's true." When you shower during the day it turns into a habit. I am sure, Stasenko? This habit is not necessary. I'd rather get some rest. The Kombat Commander does not leave me alone for a minute. He thought it would be a breeze. Thankfully, not all are like Stasenko. Always complaining. He should be getting ready to attack. This offensive is no big deal. They are just digging. They spent all week digging trenches. They dug so much that it made a subway. Of course, everyone wants it. To escape the drudgery. Go away, Stasenko. When the commander returns, you'll have to help him train his hawks. I do not know when the offensive will begin, but I promise it will be a historic battle. It seems that the Germans relaxed a little. A surprise awaits them. It'll be unforgettable. Use the snow shovels as a measure. 5 blade length and 1.5 in height. - We will do the dome later. - Understood! Can I ask you a question, Lieutenant? How will this Trojan horse move? Like a sled. We have snow in abundance. "Exploits of the Red Army," listen guys... Soldier Filin neutralizes a camouflaged German tank. He crawled fearlessly among the enemy tanks and destroyed the tank and the crew with grenades. After the explosion, a group of Nazis approached with the intent to capture him alive. When the Germans surrounded Comrade Filin, he detonated his last grenade. With the explosion, several German soldiers died. The fearless soldier had a heroic death. And here's more... About Mitraljeskoj of Kurenkov Company? Exactly. Have you already read? I do not read these things. I have to admit, Commissioner, I found it better to roll a cigarette with that part. I could tell the story, but you told me to shut the fuck up... Comrade Filin drove me crazy with that last grenade. We are in November, and you, Vasily, You are reading September news. You're right, it's September. See? I've never heard of this Kurenkov Company. What did they do? The boys defeated a German army of MGs. The Germans retreated. - They sent very well. - How can I tell you? This news that they disclose are always very similar. Why do we need this timber tank? Let's get him on the offensive? That offensive, Gavrilo Stefanovic? - Where did you hear that? - Do not know? Everyone just talks about it. There is no reliable information. Do not listen to rumors. Who wants an offensive? Sit it out. Whom do we attack in this offensive? Did you see anyone loading weapons? You're acting like a child. You can not... can arrive at any time. Why are we here? - It's been three weeks. - That's what I'm talking about. Why are we so long without attacking the Germans? - On here? - Yes. Why are we digging so many trenches, if we are going on an offensive? They did not send a 2nd Lieutenant here for nothing. Elsewhere they may be attacking, but here, I find it hard. We must be patient. I can be patient. It is better to wait than to leave for an offensive... - It is better to stay on defense. - Of course. - Where? - Right here. Good. Come on. Faster! Faster! A tank moves faster. Come on, come on, throw! Went over. Too late! It took him a while to throw, Sengirbaev. It exploded onto you. And, why stop? Did I tell you to stop? Drag it to the other side and return. I'll tell you when to stop. And when you fail, let it pass over you and attack from behind. Throw one, two or three bottles until it burns in flames. Always stay in the trenches. There will be many tanks. If you die, who will stop the other tanks? Get some rest. Now it's your turn. The Germans occupy this sector, four tank divisions, and three infantry divisions. A group moves toward Volokolamsk, Klina and Dmitrov, approaching Moscow from the north. The second group is preparing to attack directly from the west. The strategic importance of Volokolamskog this time is crucial. The Germans will probably try, with the help of the SS, to pass on the road to Yadrov, ignoring thus our antitank defense fields. This maneuver can be made from the following: Going by road, Muromtsevo, to Yadrova or Pitomnik. Of Zhdanov through Nelidovo, passing Boshoi, and Nikoljskog Petilina, on the road from farm to Matronjino station. Can not be achieved in the direction of Kraskova, passing Dubosekovo. Our mission is: Prevent enemies from crossing the road to Volokolamskoe and stop their advance. We are four companies against three regiments. We are aware that we must stop them. The question is: for how long? For now, let's wait for the beginning of the enemy offensive. Unfortunately, before the attack, we can only speculate on which direction they will ultimately come from. Comrades of the Red Army! In previous battles, you have always shown a lot of courage and heroism against the Nazi invader who invaded our territory. They want, at all costs, to reach Moscow, the heart of our homeland. But here... Here, first, feel the taste of his own blood in his mouth. Here, first, the invincibility of the German army will be questioned. Here, for the first time, they will be forced to stop. Because they stumble along the way! They feel for the first time, anger and impotence. Your Blitzkrieg will be contained. And, moved by hatred, they gathered huge strength for a new attack. Again dreaming of conquering our capital. But now they know what awaits them. Now they know how the Russians love their homeland. They know how we will fight for it. Now, no longer will they use terror as a weapon. Red Army soldiers! The enemy advances again toward Moscow. He will try to conquer this land using his air force, his artillery, his tanks and infantry. But they will not be able to come by. That's why we are here, my dear brothers! Thousands of soldiers have already left their names in history. But none had such a glorious destiny as ours. Today, not only Moscow is watching, nor our huge Motherland... Today, the whole world is watching us, holding its breath. Because here, in this line, we defend all humanity. Let us be worthy of this honor. Someone once told me that in the last century, somewhere in Japan, a band of thieves terrorized a region. No one could stop them. A village was completely destroyed. Residents of a village decided that they would withstand the next attack. - Certainly, they would die. - They acted right. They had not mastered the art of war. They decided to hire an expert. The same was done to us, when they brought the Lieutenant. How did they hire him? I do not know, maybe they found someone from the village. I do not remember. He assessed the situation and began to train the people, and brought in another six. I think we all were noble... There was a Samurai? I told you it happened in Japan... They were called to protect the village. And what do you think happened? The bandits were numbering 40, maybe more. - Against the seven? - Yes. - They fought for money? - It may have been. I do not remember. Maybe they fought for the honor. Let him finish. Stop interrupting. Will you tell us what the story is about soon? How it ends? These warriors knew a lot about battles. Built walls and posted sentries. They began training the locals, so... The village was saved. When the bandits attacked the village... they had many losses, but they killed all the bad guys. - All? - All. Someone may have escaped, but they ended up with the pack once and for all. - Very well. - I heard a similar story. Only it was not in Japan, but somewhere in America. The heroes were not noble, but ordinary shepherds. Taking this fact, all the rest is like. - 7 to 40. - This is called a "folk tale". It does not seem very true to me. Since when do shepherds know how to shoot so well? Our Mungatu Shepherds also know how to shoot. And we Perekop herders, only we know how to do roast lamb. It you are good. Prepare the whole place, and at 8 am send me a report. And keep me informed of any changes. - Is that clear? - Understood. So... Put the 316th Rifle Division on the right flank and 50 men of the cavalry on the left flank. Be very careful. I will leave it under control. - So it is with the manuals. - Hope so. That's why you're here. You can be calm, comrade Kombat. You no longer need to ride in the woods to destress. Sorry, the unfortunate comment. It's all very clear: Germany on one side, and on the other, Moscow. - What did you say? - Nothing, comrade Kombat. The question is simple, comrade Kombat. The Germans prepare an attack. We know where and when. It is not clear to me why we are waiting. Why not attack? How do we attack? Just tell us. You know how the soldiers are... We do not have troops to attack and defend at the same time. Our task is to keep the position obstinately. Is that clear? Understood, Comrade Kombat. Do not worry. We will stay here until death. I do not want you to die, I want to fight with vigor. They understood the difference? To fight with guts and courage you need to be alive. Do not confuse things. - Is it clear? - Yes. We live, Comrade Kombat. We understood then. They are dismissed. Surely this is not true. There are real shepherds. But it is what is written in the history books. Men. - This is an army. - It's an army. He had already said, Moskalenko... - They were at war? - Yes. And why were the Greeks so few? There were no more? Were few... In the beginning, seemed to be few. But then they saw they would not need anyone else. The Greeks killed 10,000 and then left? No, it was not so. Unlike the Japanese, all shepherds died. This story is a very big lie. Lie! Lie! This history is a lie. It was night, when an old lady heard the soldiers coming. She left the house to see them. "You are one of us?", she asked. "We are yes, ma'am," I replied. She said, "Thank you, Lord," and made the sign of the cross. We warned that the Germans were very close. "Yesterday they bombed all day." "Did not even spare the church." "Bloody Pagans, They look like Muslims", she said. You hear that, "Muslims ..." Muslims also made the sign of the cross. Musabek, the Kazakh told her: "Lady, 2/3 of my people, are descendants of Muslims." The old woman stepped back and said, "You are really on our side?" The Musabek spoke in Russian: "We're on your side, ma'am. Can you not see we're alike?" "Do you not see that we are from Kazakhstan, Quirsguistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan?" And the old woman said, "there are no more Russian soldiers?" And one of us yelled: "The Russians are done!" - You deceived her? - They gave the old woman a scare. She must have seen a lot in this war. I was scared from the moment he saw you in the dark. You told her: - "God forbid"? - Yes. - "Muslims ..." - Come on, guys, hurry up. The day will be born soon. We still have all this to dig. Here you can not be seen from above. Leave the nap for later. After what? Dinner? After they dig a false trench. Look... I can not believe it. I even thought that today the day would be boring. I thought I was going to sleep after spending a sleepless night. Come on guys, for God's sake. Enough talk. Enough. You should camouflage your face. Why?? Because the Germans are not stupid. OK, folks. Get it over with. And what will you have for dinner? The same as lunch. What did he say? Dig... If they come here, we will have a good view. And where else could they come from? They can attack through the forest, where the troop from Nelidova is. Maybe they know about this troop, so try to avoid it. Another reason we check everything. As you wish. They will certainly discover us. Only those who are around us. From here you can see if they move forward. Let's go down to the machine gun shelter. Make yourself comfortable! Let's see what you did. Keep working. Make yourself comfortable! So... What's that? Can you handle it? If necessary, we can, yes, Captain. We are well positioned. The tanks will not see us, and we have a good angle. Let us do it all today. - Where will your supporters be? - There. I'll make another position. It will be better to have one more. In general... Overall, it's not bad. I remember once, that our commissioner read a German pamphlet aloud. Beware what you say... - It will end up in court. - He will miss us... The captain is bound to get rid of one. But I'll tell you... In this leaflet it said that those who surrendered to the Germans should wave a white cloth. Afanasij, of the 1st Company, a good guy, but very stupid, he goes and asks: "And where can I get one?" I told him, "Take off your boots and wave with your socks." "They are not white." "Then take off your pants and shake your ass." He took off his pants and starts to but reads it. - Holy mother... - What a vision of Hell... His ass trembled more than a pirate flag. And I said to him: "The Germans will shoot you". "If they do not shoot, I will shoot..." "There's no choice, there is no escape from the Red Army." "Lower your pants if only to shit ..." All died laughing, but he did not understand the joke... Why did you tell us that? I see this pile of white cloth... And I wonder if they are not exaggerating in camouflage? We must camouflage the best possible way, so they bombard here. We will do as they want. I think it is already good. By far it should look very intimidating. Well... We can do a lot of these and will not attract their attention. - Maybe... - And why not draw? The Germans are not stupid. I knew that our bombers have no gunner in the back. German pilots learned to slaughter them by the tail. Our people are very creative. Someone had the idea of putting a tube in the tail, like a machine gun, to scare the Germans. And then? It worked... This could deceive them. They were very smart. We are not on an equal footing, we are able to betray him, but we can not. Why not? Because it is only earth and nothing else. - Nothing else? - That counts for a lot... It's just where we live. And nothing else. Do you think this is just? That's a lot, almost everything. People can not live without having a homeland. Yes, you're right. There are more important things than the earth. Those under German rule, not fighting for land. It is another thing that is at stake. What you said is true. Not fighting for land. Because there is something more important than the earth, - It is the homeland, Musa. - Yes. Land can live under the yoke. It can be trampled, broken down and burned for years or centuries. It can be washed with tears and blood, and will only continue being ground. The country does not. Homeland is the home of the people, home to their ancestors centuries ago. This is what we call homeland. The land is a country where people live. And the country is how they live. And the nation? What nation? The nation is the set of people, who want to speak the same language and live in the same country. It can not be, Vasily Georgievich. Things can not be that simple. And if a French or a German learns the Russian language and decides to live here? - Go and become Russian? - German, I do not know... The French... I would like to see them fighting with us against the Nazis. Maybe become Russians. Who knows? There he is... We should not have spoken of them. Is it ours? Just so you know. They will be using binoculars. They were able to see all around. At first they flew lower. Do they have binoculars? Before, they were bolder. But after we slaughtered some 10 of them, remember that they manufacture the best lenses in the world. Do they realize that guns are false? I will hit him with my rifle. No way, this is impossible. Why not? In a neighboring regiment they shot one down with a rifle. - I read it in the newspaper. - I've never read any of it. - It is true. - Yes it is. You know it? One shot and it went straight into the ground. As if it were paper. Everything is possible in this war. If it's that simple, why do we not bring him down? Hey, hey, hey... Shadrin, what are you doing? Put that gun down! What are you doing, Shadrin? You lost your mind? - Because? - Because. Why do you not keep quiet? We need to finish the camouflage. So I can go to sleep soon. It's already morning, and we have not yet rested. Listen... Leave him alone, let him shoot. Let him get off a couple of shots. He'll miss it... Show to these Germans that we are not kidding. Do what you want... Did you hit him? Almost. - Kajarat! What are you doing? - Shut up. Barbed wire! Look! 200 meters of wire. Where did you get this, folks? With the sappers. Was it expensive? No... It was free. - Engineers did not see you? - How did you do it? - They did not stop you? - Of course not. There was no one. Only the barbed wire... Someone said, "Take what you want." So we brought it back here. I see you are not lazy. Can you go and bring more? Maybe we should bring another roll. We will see. We can send someone if necessary. Let me ask you something. There are rich peasants who live close to Moscow? You spoke to them. Is this true? Well, listen. I told Dani, we can do business with this roll. We can exchange it for a potato sack. A Danilo said, "You know best." I told him: So come on... We knocked on a window... A little old man appeared, he greeted us and said, "What will you do with this roll?" "Will you give it to me?" We want to exchange it for something else. He looks and says, "What will I do with it?" I said, "Do you not know?" "You can do several things. A fence, for example." You do not have a fence. Call someone to help you. And he says: "No... Thank you for having offered it to me, but I ..." "I do not want to look at the snow through that barbed wire." "It will spoil the landscape. Do you understand?" That's it! And... So... You can not sell this thing to anyone. They always gave some excuse. Captain, Commander Kombat is calling you on the phone. - Captain Gundilovich. - Good morning, Gundilovich. - What is the report? - It's all right, Major. The day was pulled, let's get some rest. Good, rest! Here, everything is as planned. Tomorrow will be very demanding of you. You will need a lot of enthusiasm. Keep your phone active. We will take every care. Today the Artillery Commander will arrive. Arrange a room for him. If things harden tomorrow he should support you. Understood, Comrade Major. That's all. Now, go get some rest. - Is Klocskov there? - Yes, he's here. The orders for him are the same. - Understood. - Understood. Execute the order. - What happened? - It's all right. He told us to sleep. Anything else? Just one more thing... He said Georgy Fedorovich will help us with artillery tomorrow. If things get ugly... Just hearing these words, I feel better. O OK then... That's it... will start. See how accurate they are? If they knew our position, they would hit us in full... See what we get. We will take three hours of bombardment, without any loss. We will be a bit deaf. Then we can say that we are excellent soldiers, diggers of trenches. Mostly false trenches. Did you not go to sleep, gunner? What is the problem, Commissioner? We were just enjoying this music. When this is over, they can get some rest. - Do you have cigarettes? - I have none left. Only steam comes out of the mouth. Instead of smoke. Let's change this steam for smoke. Is it over already? Motherfuckers... - You saved the smoke? - Yes. They do not even look like they're Germans. - And this now resembles a little? - That one now yes. Accurate as an orchestra. Accurate in all calibers. Are you not our teacher? Yes... I know nothing about conducting. I think it's time to pause. When you pause, they will come with an appetite for revenge. They may come, the table is set. Our service is first rate. Why have they made a mast? Hide it in the shelter! This land cannot be ploughed anymore. It's full of steel. Come on, we will both plow and sow. We just need people for this! Protect yourself dope. It's time. Now we have to stop them. - Stop what? - Tanks. - How many? - We do not know. I still can not really see them, but they are coming here. They warned on the radio that they are coming right at us. Soon they will stop shooting. We have to be ready. Okay. Please contact the captain. Understood? Do not fret... Keep calm, comrades. Open fire only on my command. When I give the signal, shoot! Fire two shots. The infantry will hide behind the tanks and will delay them. Then we will open fire. Keep your head down. They're coming right at us, see? And where else would they go? I mean it's better this way, what an offensive. Lucky us. You know what they think? Everything is running as planned. They think they found our weakness and it will be easy to move by road. That's nice. Let them find it, right? Then, we'll show them what they do not know, that Russians have no weak points, right? In fact, I'm from Kazakhstan. A Kazakh, Che, you are not Russian? You're kidding! We are not fighting together for Russia? - I'm just kidding... - You're kidding. When we fight for Kazakhstan, we all show. We are also Kazakhstanis, I have no doubt about it. Ten it is. Open fire on tanks and infantry. Objective 47?. Open fire on the tanks and infantry. Objective 47?. - Explosive grenades! - Explosive grenades! Second charge, the main direction at 2-30! Second load, main direction at 2-30! Main direction at 2-30! - Higher level of 0-0-2! - Higher level of 0-0-2! Target 124, 3, shot, fire! Target 124, 3, shot, fire! Target 124, 3, shot, fire! - Ready! - Fire! Right 25. Advancing! - Target 122, left 0-11. - Target 122, left 0-11. Range 0-15, 4 shots in a row! Range 0-15, 4 shots in a row! - Ready? Fire! - Ready? Fire! They thought it would be easy? This is not good... These vultures will destroy the artillery. Vultures eat carrion. These ones like fresh blood. Kombat, artillery batteries will be destroyed, because of the Luftwaffe. Panfilov will be on their own. Stop them! - Fire! - Fire! Antitank ammunition! Take cover! Change position! Load with antitank! The wake of this was destroyed. For now it's dead. In less than half an hour it will be repaired. We must destroy it before that happens. Attack them, fast! I will put fire in them. Antitank! Look at that... It seems that we put them on the run. Do not get so excited. They will return. They will not like it, what they found here. Is this not so? No... They loved it. They will call reinforcements and come back harder. Were you looking for reinforcements? Yeah, reinforcements. More reinforcements... OK, OK! They'll come back with more reinforcements... It is very clear they lost the first attack. They thought they would come to our wake, but they found us having a party. A failure of infantry and tanks... Of course they will return. Perhaps they thought that if there was someone left alive he would run. What makes you think they would do that, eh, Simjakin? Why did you not fire? Not once? I will shoot when the time is right... Klockov, Maksimov, follow me. Fast! They will try another strategy. Something more effective. And they are still going strong. They are looking for our weaknesses. They are going to orchestrate another concert of greater impact. Yes, but now with the loudest sound. No problem. We're almost deaf. So... Slowly, slowly, calm... Lets go. Go... Pasha! Pasha, it's okay. They hit you, but you will survive. Stop the blood. You'll be fine. The important thing is not to panic, you know? You were very good. Everything will be fine. You will recover. A soldier hero. That's it. It's okay, Pasha. You'll be fine. Come on... gather strength for next time. Understood? Drive carefully but quickly. Three injured. Commissioner Klockov, report. With the support of artillery, the first attack was successfully contained. We destroyed four tanks and two infantry platoons. - Has there been a loss? - No loss. Six injured were sent to the infirmary. Pasha was wounded and we are on our own. For the time being, it's okay. We await a new attack. - Understood. Do not waste time. - Understood! Let's consolidate our position before they attempt another attack. When it will be, I do not know. They have little time. They have to break our line before the day is over. They will not be long. They will return with full force. It will be a heavy attack. They will attack differently. Is there room? Hey, this way! Nazarov, come to the shelter, fast! You're hurt, Nazarov? Nazarov! I'm not hurt, Comrade Sergeant. Do not disturb me. I'm going to lose him. Do not waste time with this. We have to destroy the tanks! Let him come closer. I'm going to knock down at least one. They are flying freely. Bravo, Nazarov! He left him scared to death. Now, go to the shelter. Fast! Have you seen any of our planes? - They are defending Moscow. - The same as we are doing. It can be said that we are privileged. What a privilege! Why then am I so afraid? I hope I do not die all scared shitless. Unfortunately they have ammo to spare. But they do not have our bravery, Sengirbaev. You better take care not to die before your time, okay? There's no way to know what they are planning. Our planes can ambush them, can they not? - Germans are not naive. - They are not fools, but we deceived their artillery. We destroyed their tanks and infantry. Holy shit... You know what I predict, comrades? Soon it will be dark and the Germans will continue to attack. Comrades, we need to stick a thorn in their heel. We have to hit their Achilles heel. I agree with you, Comrade Sergeant. Let's stay here discussing tactics, or wait until they kill us all? Our tactics will be, no one being a hero. - As well? - As? Today, guys, we do not have to die for the motherland. Today, the country needs us alive and fighting. That's new. Is anyone in a hurry to get there? If our destiny is to die, we die then. What? If you die, who will fight in your place, Simjakin? Or do you not care? How many people will die if you do not fight? If the Germans defeat us, our people will pay dearly. No one will condemn you for having died. He died in battle... All old and new sins will be forgiven... They will tell you that you were born to be a hero, will they not, Shimyakin? I got carried away, Sergeant... No one wants to die. Unfortunately, it does not depend on us. You're wrong. Whether you die or not, the decision is yours. I decide. A bomb will fall here, or I'll take a shot... Certainly, it'll only happen if I want it to. Lifting your head to take a shot is an interesting way to die quickly and painlessly. Senja, Senja... Wait! It was nothing. Do not worry. We will take care of you. When I went to the dentist, I discovered what real pain is. This is nothing. Say no more. Guys, what do you think about stopping these discussions? Somehow, out there can be very interesting. I'm in. Everything depends on the situation. The situation is as follows: The enemy must be destroyed systematically! Maybe they do not know that we are few. Let's make the Germans feel again the taste of defeat. We will do exactly as we trained these days. The Germans, the situation is as follows: If we lose, they will destroy our people. We can not allow them to pass by us. I do not want heroes here today. We do not need that. Just burn those tanks. 4th Company, answer. 4th Company, answer. 2nd Company, transfer me to the 4th. 4th Company, answer. - Panorama are you there? - Yes. Assume your positions. The battle will soon begin. - They are? They are how many? - Three. Come on, guys, fast. We have to collect the wounded. - Are there many wounded? - Many. - Some dead? - A lot. Calm down, hold on. Raise the machine gun! It means that you are hungry predators? This little beauty here will spoil their appetite. Faster, faster... Petruha... Petruha, find out where the cable was broken. Restore the phone line. Hurry! If we do not repair the cable, this carriage will make twice as many trips. Maybe triple. It's working? Bravo, Petruha. - Klockov reporting. - What happened? The 4th Company had many losses. We had many dead and wounded. We have 28 soldiers, and a cannon, two anti-tank rifles, one MG, rifles and machine guns. We need support, Comrade Major. No, Vasily Georgievich. I can not support it. Try to resist. Please continue resisting. We'll do our best, Comrade. Major. Artillery in their positions! The others should form groups of three. Each group must destroy a tank. Each cannon to destroy nine tanks. Let's see how they behave. This is for starters. Let's see how it goes. The best would be if each group destroyed two tanks. That's it, my brothers... We do not have much choice. We are at the limit of our strength, but we have to defend our homeland. And we are ready to die for it. There is nowhere to retreat, and we can not die before stopping the Germans. This is our destiny. Behind us... Behind us is Moscow. Why are you standing there, Grisha? You need an invitation? Come with us! Grigory Alexandrovich, is it true that the fascists... they tried to destroy the bunker you were in, throwing grenades and you returned all 14 grenades? - How many? - 14 grenades. Jeez... It's a lie. Do not listen. Forgive them Lord, they do not know what they say... And how many were there then? - It was 5, not 14... - Five? Then... They waited a little while, and tried the 6th. Hoping she did not return. They thought I did not. I could get it back. And you did what? I'll tell you what happened. Then when? At night, before bed. I was not in the bunker... This time, our task is not so easy, Commander. We have to let them approach as much as possible. Let them believe that we are all dead. Come on, Ivan Evstafievich. They must be confident in their tanks. They are praying for their God, or cursing Satan because he sent the Russians. It's good I am not a Tanker! Because death is certain. Lord, forgive our sins and bless us. Grant us victory over the enemy. Protect our people and have mercy on us. What's it? - Anything. - You said something. For the fatherland, that is what I said. Ah, well... All right, then. They are many... What happened, my dear brothers? That was not... There was nothing... That was for you, comrades... rest in peace. Send me those fuckers... Do not become heroes! Protect yourself or you're going to die! Grisha, ammunition! That bullet had the symbol of the swastika... It entered through his throat! What is it, Petya? Did you get scared? Come on, Vanya! Bring it on! Are you ready? Come on! What happened? - No more grenades! - Me neither! Let the tanks go! We will attack the infantry! Can you shoot? Do not let them go! Do you want to go through? Ammunition! Ammunition! Ammunition! Where do you think you're going? This is to ward off the cold, guys. - Vasily! - Did I hit him? - I could not see. - No, it's not destroyed. - Only damaged the shield. - Then destroy him, Shemyakin. Quick. Leave me here. Go alone, Grisha... Hurry up! - Shemyaki, do you still have ammunition? - I only have a little. Take this one, and follow me! Let's go! Shoot the infantry! Vanya, are you alive? I think I'm still alive... What's going to happen to me? Where's my hat? How many grenades do you have? We do not have enough. Let's find the Diev. Come on, let's go! We have nothing, Commissioner. But we will stop them. You know who did it, Vasya? It was Danila, the magician. Is anyone else alive, or just us left? Maybe there's someone else. I have not seen them yet. Bravo, Dani. He saved the best for last. - We managed to stop them. - Where did they go? The Germans were bewildered. - I did not mean... - Do not be modest. I did not have the intention... This pile of scrap should serve for something. Well... They will go to recycling. - There were about fifty? - Good... For my grandchildren I will say that there were more. There were 14 German tanks in one afternoon. Not counting the 4 in the morning. These do not count. Why don't we tell them? Of course we will count them. Until lunch we were one company... But after the evening attack, we were reduced to a platoon. The afternoon attack killed many good soldiers. Heroes... So they will be remembered by Russia, Dani. And others do not. That is because... War is like that. Communist heroes are patriots. The rest... The rest... is bread with bologna! PANFILOVS 28 SOLDIERS
