Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Record heat continues for its fifth straight day throughout the five boroughs. Several deaths have already been reported with no indication of when relief might come. The health department recommends to drink plenty of fluids and stay inside or under shade as much as possible. Returning to our lead story this morning, the .44 caliber killer has struck again, this time in the Bronx. The victim, an unidentified brunette, has been confirmed to fit the killer's pattern of targeting women with long dark hair, shot at close range on the sidewalk or in parked cars. In a chilling letter released by police from the killer, he wrote, "I am still here like a spirit roaming the night, thirsty, hungry, seldom stopping to rest, and I will see you at the next job. In their blood and from the gutter." -Sam's cre... For fuck's sake. Leave that ball. Crazy out here. - Hey there, man! - What do you... Okay, I'm coming down there. Where's my family supposed to go? It's not my problem. I'll have your money by the end of the week. That's too late. Where you going with my stuff? See you later. - Hello? - Margot? June? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm, I'm fine. I, uh... You don't sound okay. It's just... I'm sorry I've been out of touch. It's great to hear your voice. - Yours, too. - Where are you? - My grandmother's. - What? I thought that was just supposed to be temporary. Yeah, well, um, I guess I'm in a bit of a tight spot right now and yeah, I, I was wondering if, maybe, you could, uh, if you could see clear to lend me a bit more money? Just, just till the end of the month. Mm. Well, how about I come on the train tomorrow? I'll bring what I can. Come here? No, no! You, it's not a good time. I'm, um... listen, I, um, couldn't you just, you could mail some, like you did before. Don't be ridiculous. I, I really miss you. I want to see you. Yeah, but, but it's not a good time, Margot. I, I'm very busy and I won't be here. Who are you kidding? I'll catch the 11 o'clock. And be there by the afternoon. No! Wait, Margot. I said no! It'll be great. Oh, shit! Ah! Firing back today against suspicious accusations earlier this month that the city's antiquated electrical... Caused by rising temperatures. Experts are saying it's skyrocketed... Leave me the fuck alone! Where's the usual kid? Uh, he, he ain't around no more. I'm Freddie. You realize you're more than four hours late. I mean, yeah, I mean, with this heat, it's been slow-going. So, you know... Do you have any idea how inconsiderate it is to be late? Late with food? Make people wait for food? Hey, look. Look, lady. Lady. Don't call me lady. Listen, we, we just been backed... Don't call me lady. Well, what's your name, then? June. How much do I owe you? $16.70. I could bring these in for you. No, no, no. Just stay there. Don't come in. Hey! You got anything smaller? Don't they give you change? This neighborhood? Serious? Just keep the change. What you want me to do with the bags? Here, I'll take them. All right, um, thanks for the tip. Hey! Have you been ringing my buzzer? I mean, yeah, you just buzzed me up here. No, I mean, from before. Earlier. Why would I do that? Yeah, okay. Thanks for the tip. Wait, just a sec. Can you take these down for me? Five bucks. What? I just gave you a three-dollar tip. Yeah, but that garbage stinks. I'll give you two. Three. And let me use your sink. My sink? Yeah. It's brutal out there. Enrique ain't got so much as a fart blowing through that bodega, so, shit. Hey, yo. Thanks. Can't stand being dirty. Hey, thanks. Yeah, you welcome. What's up, man. How you been, yo? What the hell? Oh, goddamn it! - Hello? - Yeah, Hi, it's June. - Si, senora. - I just had a delivery today. Okay. Your new kid just dropped it off and, uh, my cigarettes weren't in the bag. Are you sure? Yeah, I paid for them. The whole carton. Masterson Lights. Okay, senora. I, I'm gonna make sure you get them. Okay? -Soon? Yeah, pronto, pronto. Okay, thank you. Thanks. Two men are under arrest on suspicion of arson and murder in the Bronx suburb club firing that killed 25 persons in October. They will appear in criminal court on Tuesday in Manhattan where prosecutors are anticipating a quick hearing and motion to trial. I would just like to say that the investigation is continuing in full force in Brooklyn. Uh, according to witnesses that we talked to over the past, you know, 24 hours, uh, he's a male, a white male, 25 to 35. Approximately 5' 7 to 5' 10. Hmm. Hello? Freddie? I'm calling the cops, you motherfuckers! 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Uh, yes, hello, um, you know, it's, um... What's your emergency, ma'am? - Emergency? - Ma'am? I, I just wanted... I'd like to report a disturbance. What kind of disturbance? Ma'am? The most recent victim was killed inside a parked car in the South Bronx, near an apartment building where a young man witnessed the aftermath of the crime from his fourth-story window. I heard some shots, when I ran over, there was blood all over the pavement. Following the latest shooting, a new letter was received by police further taunting them over the killings and promising more bloodshed. In what has now become a cryptic calling card, the killer began his letter with a greeting. "Hello from the gutters of New York." What do you mean you can't let me in? Are you out of your mind? I mean, more than usual? You're being ridiculous. Look, whatever it is, it's okay. No judgments. My God, June. How long has it been since you left here? Why didn't you tell me things had gotten so bad? I could have helped. I keep expecting to find a dead body. Oh, yeah, well, it wouldn't surprise me. Throw that out. It's a first edition. Yeah, well... here, I have more. Get rid of them. - All of them. - What? These are actually important to keep. Why? You wanna purge me of my stuff, so do it. Purge away. Let's take a break. Get some things for dinner. Come on. Let's get out of here. We can go downtown, catch a show. You can, June. This thing, It's all in your head. Ridiculous. Better be up by the time I get back. No. I'm well aware of that. I'm sorry I didn' t tell you this. Jane, she's sick. Love you, too. I can't even... I can't, but these. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. Do you remember the look on their faces? You, you were a fucking lunatic! Why didn't you tell me you were still here, like this? Well, I guess, after everything that happened, I... I figured this was a safe place. Safe? Half of the buildings around here are burned down. I know your grandmother made this a sanctuary for you, but that's changed. I mean, this place is a... time bomb. It's not okay, you continuing like this. Um, and what do you suggest, Margot? Hm? I mean, what is it? This magical solution you seem to have all figured out for me. I'm sorry about what happened. I really am. But you have to get back up and fight. What do you know about that? You think because I left the city, I gave up my work? I... I never tried to play the game the way you did. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Are you kidding me? Do you have any idea what it was like watching those obsequious fucks praising you ad nauseam? People who probably never even read a word of your work. Do you remember what you said to me when my first reviews came out? My proximity to you... negated the chance of my ever being a success. Don't give me that shit. I supported you. I went to every one of your shows. I... I paid your rent! -I... I even... What is it? Don't answer it. Are you in some sort of trouble? No. It's, it's been happening like this. - Who is it? - I don't know. Sometimes two, three times a night. I go to answer it and no one's there. Screw this. I'm gonna go find out. No, please, don't. I can't see anyone. I can't see anyone. Didn't you say a delivery kid got a look at the place? Yes, but... it's something much more sinister than that. I don't want you to bug, but I brought you something. What the fuck is that? It's a .38. I don't care what number it is. I got it when I was being stalked by that guy in the Village. And now that I live in the sticks, I don't need it anymore. It's easy to use. June, this stuff is... so fucking raw. I... I can't believe you have it all just sitting here like this, pages and pages of it. Uh, you have to finish this. I... I'll help you put it together and, it's, it's absolutely brilliant. No! June, don't. Don't do this. Don't. Why are you doing that? I know you're taking some sick satisfaction in all of this. - No. - Coming here, seeing me like this. I don't want your money and I don't need your pity. I want you to go. What? Get out. An emphatic wunderkind, June E. Leigh has been a staunch voice in the anti-establishment movement. Countless articles have profiled her affluent family, fromTime toHarper's, as one of the most influential in America today. June E. Leigh. Now, it's widely understood that even though you presented your first novel, simply titledThe Patriarch, as a work of fiction, the main character, uh, Lawrence Bottinger, a political manipulator and, uh, unrepentant Vietnam War profiteer and, as you suggest, a prolific misogynist, appears, in fact, to be a thinly-veiled portrait of your father, renowned entrepreneur and philanthropist, Irving Leigh. Well, it's just that, Hans, a character. Its, uh, publication and subsequent notoriety have led to a criminal investigation of your father's organizations and practices. And it's been said that your mother and siblings have disowned you from the Leigh clan over this manifesto. This gossip-mongering is ridiculous. If you wanna have a real debate here, Hans, let's have it. Uh, people are being clubbed, freaked, zapped and bricked while the smug male intelligentsia sit around belittling it all. You call yourself a patriot, Sparling? Rome is burning. Wake up! I acquiesce! Now, several members of your own family have condemned you. Some have even suggested that your book has been the chief contributor to your father's sudden death. What did you say? Your father died of a heart attack yesterday. Haven't you seen the papers? Oh. Goddamn it, Margot. Fuck around with my stuff. Barton And Barton. Uh, Francesca Bartolometi's office, please. Who's calling? June. June Leigh. One moment. Junie? Uh, hello, Francesca. I can't believe it's you! I'm wonderful, of course, sweetie. How are you, my dear? Uh, great. Everything's great. That's fabulous to hear. Junie, we've been trying to get a hold of you for ages. I'm, I' m so sorry, Francesca. I was... I guess it 's, it's my health. It's, it's been really touch and go lately. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, in fact, um, that's why I was calling. See, um... I was hoping that maybe, to see if, I, if you could, uh, send me the remainder of my advance. June, in spite of everything that happened, you still owe us a book. I, I know, I, it's just that I was... You disappeared. We gave you the largest advance ever given to a writer. - It's been four years. - I know. You're one of my favorites, so it makes it really difficult for me to say this, but if you don't deliver some sort of draft soon, I will have no choice but to turn the matter of repayment to accounting. Yeah, listen, Francesca, the new work, it's, it's really coming along beautifully. Really. Well, then that's fantastic. I can't wait. I knew you wouldn't let me down. When do we see something? One month. Okay. Ciao! Damn it. Yeah. Enrique said, uh, Enrique said sorry about the mix-up from last time. It was a mistake, but he ain't charge you for it. Yeah, well, I paid for them and I gave you three extra dollars. That was a tip. Are you kidding me? You want them or not? - You're ripping me off. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said I tried to steal your smokes? Are you telling me you didn't? Look, lady, I may be a hustler, but I ain't no thief. And I sure as hell ain't no liar. Oh, nice shoes, Pookie. Don't touch me, nigga. I'll put my boot up your ass. Oh, you a bitch ass nigga. Put your hands up. I said back up, bitch! -Ow! 'Fuckin' savage immortal fools. Why do you go so close to them? I've seen you. You always head right for them. Fuck them. That's why. Doesn't sound very preservationist of you. Yeah, well, those dudes are all about anarchy. They want to tear down everything they see as good in this world. Do you mind my asking? What happened? What? My arm? Building fire. When I was a little kid, my mom died trying to pull me out. They say it was the owners who did it, but they could never prove it. I'm... I'm sorry. The world only gives you back what you give it. Hey, um, you better be careful. Those dudes find out you a crib job, they gonna do a push-in on you. What does that mean? I mean, who you trying to kid, lady? You were spooked. The killer's eighth attack in just over 12 months came on this lonely street in Brooklyn. Gasoline tax if approved by congress... Much of the nation is sweating with temperatures hovering in... Addict-free rehabilitation center has a 24-hour hotline for... And that's it for The Wolf Hour. See you back here tomorrow. Same time, same place. It's the police, ma'am. Hi. I'm responding to a harassment complaint. You call that in? Yeah. That was over a week ago. Lady, it's the worst crime summer on record, so we're not exactly working at full capacity here. I... I'm sorry, officer. I just, I wasn't sure if you were coming. Come in. You know, somebody got shot in the face three blocks from here the other night. You know what they were fighting over? A goddamn ice-cream cone. You fucking believe that? Goddamn people. Animals. Um... can I make you some coffee? Yeah. That'd be nice. Thanks. - Is it just you? - Yeah. I used to be with my grandmother, but she passed. My condolences. Thanks. Mind if I sit down? Please. Now, why don't you tell me what's been going on here? Yeah, well, um, it's kind of hard to explain, but... That's all right. You just take it slow. I'm here to help you. Okay, so it's, it's my buzzer. See, it's been ringing over and over, day and night. Sometimes... two, three times a night. Your buzzer? Yeah. But not like that. It's like someone's genuinely trying to intimidate me. Yeah. Well, that's, that's a bit weird. And what does this person say? Well, that's the point. They don't say anything. Huh. Uh... you ever go down to check it out, you know, see who it is? Uh, no. It's hard for me to go down. Why, you handicapped? No. Not like that. Look, officer... Just Blake. I realize this isn't the crime of the century here, Blake. But it's like someone is genuinely trying to scare me. Yeah, it's just that I'm not sure that ringing somebody's buzzer is actually a crime. Right. But harassment is, isn't it? Yeah, if they said something to you, if they've threatened you. Anything like that happen? No, I told you. Can't you just have someone swing by from time to time? You know, discourage them, whoever it is. You ain't got an old man you can send down? Look, I just want you to do something about whoever is harassing me. I knew a bird like you once. A lovely bird. Well, me and this gal, we had ourselves a nice little arrangement for a while. She liked to be alone, too. Just, you know, not all the time. So I'd come by, check on her and she'd tell me about all the hippy tree-hugger shit "goin" on in her world, and I'd give her the pleasure of, uh, you know, my company. You could have an arrangement like that, too, you know? 'Cause things ain't like they used to be. Right? No white knight coming to the rescue. You peaceniks, you got one thing right. This place, this country, it's changing. -And it ain't for the best. All units, fire in progress in the vicinity of 400 block of Cortland. Calling all units. Arson suspect seen on foot, heading towards Jerome Avenue. 1056, copy, dispatch, I'm out. Call of the wild. 1056, stand by, suspect may be armed. That's a hell of a cup of Joe you make there, June. Dispatch... Fuck you. You know that little bird of mine, she thought her shit didn't stink, too. That her fancy ideas would save her... when the big bad wolf came calling. Fuck you! Have a nice day. Hey, fuck you, you piece of shit! I consider myself a reluctant witness. We as English-speaking Americans are signatories to a cultural genocide of the planet. It has been estimated that by the year 2100, nearly half of the roughly 7000 languages spoken on Earth will likely disappear. Can you not see where this is heading? We create binary or singular systems. Then the world becomes literally whack in light. I consider myself a reluctant witness. We as English-speaking Americans are signatories to a cultural genocide of the planet. ...because no matter which way you slice it... If you want to understand the true nature of man, to totally grasp how something that fascist like the holocaust could happen in modern times. Sure people shout out about... Shit! God... Damn it. Hello? Uh, yeah. Hello. Go ahead. Um... I'd like to have a date. You want a date? Yes. Sex? What? Male or female? Who is it? Cleaning service. Cleaning? Look, lady, you gonna keep me down here all night? Hello? Hey. Hey. What's your name? Billy. You got a lot of locks, lady. Nice. It's good. You gotta watch out these days. People are getting nuts out there in that heat. You want something? Something to drink? Got any soda pop? You know, I gotta tell you, I almost squashed this date "after gettin" off the subway. Why the hell do you live up in this "hood?" It's like a war zone. No soda. I could make us... some coffee or, um, maybe water. - Hey! - Whoa, hey. Okay, hey. Okay, I'm sorry. That might've been a little screwed-up for me to do. Sometimes it's just, it's good to, like, break the ice. Please leave. Okay. Wait. Wait. - No. That's not necessary. - No, please. Lady, just don't worry about it, all right? I've never heard this kind of music before. It's my grandmother. Really? She sounds like the saddest person in the world. This was her place after the war. I used to come up here and visit when things got tough. What's it like out there for you? Ain't like it was when I first got here. Pimps started getting greedy and messing up dudes for not meeting their quotas. It's why I joined up with the service you called. I had to get away from that noise. You don't live on the streets, do you? Sometimes. It's not so bad in the summer. Sometimes I crash with friends. What about your family? They don't worry about you? Mind if I ask you something? No. Why this? - What? - This. I mean, I guess I don't get why someone like you is calling up midnight cowboys. What do you mean? Well, don't take this the wrong way, but you don't strike me as the kind of bird who needs to pay for it. I have a condition. Like, a disease? -No. Not like that. It's just, I don't like to leave here. At all? You mean, like, you can't? Just figure, if I stay in here, I won't do anymore damage out there. I used to have a fear kind of like that. I was an orphan, you know, adopted. Got into a lot of trouble when I was younger. Sent out to my foster uncle's farm one summer. Middle of nowhere. We had a small utility shed in the back of our barn. And one day, after he was done beating on me, he dragged me by the hair and he threw me back there. It wasn't so bad at first. But then I felt them. Dozens of spiders just crawling out of the hay, over my skin. They covered me from head to toe. They even crawled in my nose and my mouth. I screamed, but there was no way out. After that, I'd piss my pants if those fuckers even crossed my path. Ah. How did you manage to get over it? I was in a pet shop one summer and there it was. A black spider sitting there, looking right at me. Before I could think, I just snatched the fucker and I ate him. What? - Yeah. - That's crazy. It was crazy. It was a crazy thing to do. It was. What about your family? Do you ever see them anymore? No. It feels weird that I'm telling you all this. I don't really ever tell anyone nothin' about me. You expecting someone? Lady, you don't got, like, an old man or anything, do you? - No. Don't go down there. Let me check it out for you. -No, please don't. Nothing. I think someone is trying to drive me insane. Ah, it's probably just some 'hood rats messing with you. Oh, a big fat hello from the gutters of New York. Do you ever think, whoever it is ringing your buzzer, they aren't doing it to torment you? Maybe it's like a calling to go outside, face your fears. Come on! Let's go. Barton And Barton. - Uh, hello. This is June Leigh. Um, can you please connect me to Francesca Bartolometi's office? Um, Mrs. Bartolometi is currently unavailable. Well, can I... If you leave your number, I'll make sure someone gets back to you. Someone? Hey, what the hell you been living on up here? I need your help, Freddie. Can you deliver something for me? 50 bucks. What? I, I didn't even tell you where it's going. - Twenty. - Forty. After the groceries, I've only got 40 left. - Not my problem. - Okay. So you can use my sink anytime, even my bath. Forty. Please. Look, I see you standing there. I mean, I can tell you're in a bad way, that you need whatever this thing is to get where it needs to go so you can move forward with your life. You see me, and I do this for a living, and you see me, and you're gonna stand there and tell me that this thing that you need to get done isn't worth 40 bucks to you? Even if it's the last 40 bucks you have for the rest of your life? Have you not learned anything from looking out from up here? Here's the address. Make sure they know it's for Francesca Bartolometi. That's one hell of a name. Listen, Freddie. This is the only copy I have. Well, if it's so important to you, - why don't you go take it... - Just go straight there. They'll give you a check. Bring it back here as soon as you have it. Please. Cool. Freddie. Thank you. Catch you later, crib job. Margot? Please don't hang up. I wanted to call to tell you how sorry I am for how I've behaved, how I, how I treated you, how I treated everyone. Listen, I, I finished the book. And it's all in there. You, me, us, and I realize this, it doesn't even begin to make things right. But I just didn't know where, where else to start. So I was hoping if you read this, that you would see it as some kind of consolation as, as to how much I love you. And I'm so sorry. My mommy's not home right now. What? Mommy's not here. Bye. I... I don't know his last name. Listen, I don't know no Freddie. He delivers for you. Senora, I cannot help you. - What? - Okay? Can I speak to Enrique, please? Listen, Enrique no here. Okay? Okay, listen, listen, this is, this is really important. No, no, no, no. -So... Freddie? Freddie? Ah. Stop! That's good, man. Hurry up, man! Hurry up! Go, go. Got it? Let's go, let's do this. Hey, don't be stupid! Go, go, go! - Come on, come on! - Hey, hey, hey! Y'all wrong! Motherfuckers, get outta here! Hey, get out of here! No, the one on the top! Well, the lights are all out here at Shea Stadium. All the lights are out. Uh, we see matches. People are starting to fight... Traffic lights are not working, so it is hazardous. Some looting has been reported. Several people report having been stuck in elevators. New York City does have everything under control. Hospitals and so on are operating on their own auxiliary power. The best advice is to keep cool, stay calm. New York City will prevail. Get out, Eat this, motherfucker! Fuck you, cops! Due to the fact that the fire wasn't electrical in nature and it caused a bright blue... I'm warning you. Yo, what the... Come here! Open up! I don't need to hear. Let's go! What? Freddie? - Move it! - Freddie! No! No! Oh, my God! Freddie! Freddie. Oh, no. Freddie? No. Freddie? Freddie? Oh. Your new book is a phenomenal feat of personal reflection and atonement. Now, some have speculated that this work is a quasi-autobiographical testament to your time spent in a severe isolation period following the fallout and controversy of your previous novel. You've somehow managed to obtain, of what has been one of the darkest periods in this nation's history, while at the same time making it so personal. So I suppose this all begs a question, June. Is this character you?
