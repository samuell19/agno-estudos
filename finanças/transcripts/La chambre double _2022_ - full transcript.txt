WITH EXCERPTS FROM THE MYSTERY OF THE CHARITY OF JOAN OF ARC Come on Cayenne. Get a move on. - I start at the back. - Fine. - You can go back, I'll finish off. - See you this evening. Come on, Cayenne. Get in! There's the possibility of global collapses. What do we mean by collapses? They've happened in the past. It could be a banking collapse, collapses in the populations of birds and insects, ecosystems, biodiversity, people, social classes or countries. There are five criteria: wars, invasions, natural and environmental disasters, drought, etc. The fifth criteria is poor decisions by economic and political elites when faced with the abyss. This fifth criteria is the only one we've seen each time a civilisation has collapsed. As though the elites failed to see it coming. They make bad decisions because they live in a bubble. They don't see that the environment for both non-humans... ...is collapsing and there will come a point when society crumbles. Are you all on your own here? I needed some air. Some space. I couldn't breathe. Fair enough. Are you sure you're alright? Should I phone a doctor? No, I'm fine. Since time immemorial, for all of time, we have been lost. But for the past 40 years all we have been doing is getting lost. What's happening, O Lord? What's happening? It used to be the land, at least sometimes, that was a preparation for hell. It's not even that any more. The land isn't preparation for hell. Hell is now spreading across the land. What's happening, O Lord? What's happening? If you were there, O Lord, none of this would be happening. None of this would have happened. We see all of this happening before our eyes, and our only response thus far has been vain charity, with no intention of ending war. Our only response thus far has been vain charity because we do not want to end war. We are complicit in all of this. We are complicit, making us the perpetrators. We are complicit and we are the perpetrators. Complicit. It is the same as being the perpetrator. Allowing something to happen is the same as doing it. They are one and the same. The person who allows something to happen is the same as the person who does it. In fact, they are worse, because doing something at least takes courage. Someone who commits a crime at least has the courage to commit it. When you let something happen, it is the same crime. It is the same crime, only with that cowardice as well. There's that cowardice as well. All around us we see infinite cowardice. Being complicit is worse than being the perpetrator. Infinitely worse. - No, thank you. - You're right. I read that it makes you 30% more likely to get cancer, so I've stopped reading. Do you act in films as well? Now and then. But there's one thing I can't get my head around. It's crazy. One second in the present becomes one second in eternity. One second of your breathing, a smile, a glance. In each film, you become a ghost of yourself. It's not like theatre. Theatre is like making a fire out of the present with your bodies. You appear and then you disappear. It makes my head spin, especially when I'm playing Joan of Arc. You can spend the night here. I mean, if you can. Here's your room. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Yes, hello, I'm a friend of Elise. I'm calling because she's not feeling very well. No, nothing to worry about, just a bit of an accident. She just needs to take it easy. Yes, I'll be looking after her, but it would be best if she were left on her own for a few days. I think it would do her good to stay here for a bit longer. Yes. Exactly. I'll keep you posted. OK, thank you. Bye. That director of yours doesn't give up easy. Thank you, you're a star. I was too scared to phone. I don't want to leave. Right, I need to go. Will you be back tonight? - I'll need to see with my dad. - Your dad? I'm coming! How long have you been back here? Eight months. How long were you together? Three and a half years. You'll get over it soon. Look around you. Here, "All is grace". My soul is in sorrow. - Just earlier... - Then why pretend? - Why look like everybody else? - Because I'm afraid. Sorrow, fear, suffering. It's a large family and there are a lot of them. It's as though you had consumed all of the land's sorrows. How can one's soul not drown in sorrow? Just earlier I saw two children walking past, two kids, going down the path over there on their own, behind the birches, behind the hedge. The older one was dragging the other along. They were in tears, shouting, "Madam, I'm hungry!" That got me right in the gut, right in the heart. It crushed my heart, if cries can crush the heart. It caused me pain. Are you OK? Really, it's nothing. I know how your story ends. - You gave them all your bread. - That's right. And their joy caused me pain, even more pain. Did you know the greatest sin is despair? It says so here! History always repeats itself, but that's no reason to get used to it. Lord, I have secret prayers. You know. I am your confidant. Let's start there. Let's start small, then we shall see. Then we shall see. You can come in if you want. Sorry. My God, this has to end. It can't go on like this. History always repeats itself. Lord, I have secret prayers. You know. I am your confidant. When I think of those who damn themselves. When I think of all the souls who had not yet been damned when I began this prayer, but who have since been damned for all eternity. Forgive me, my Lord, if I blaspheme when I think these things. ...they all must take serious steps in order to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees over the next 12 years. The picture painted by the IPCC is highly alarming: heatwaves, the extinction of certain animal and plant species... Were you up during the night? No, why? No reason. Is your dad alright? It's so brave the way you help him. - What sort of life... - Do you have any sugar? I mean it, I really admire you. Thank you. You should be proud of yourself. It's true. It's true that my soul is in mortal suffering. I am in distress. I would never have thought the death of my soul would be so painful. All those I once loved are now absent from me. All those I love are now absent from me. That's what has killed me beyond repair. I won't go any further. I can't go. My life is completely hollow inside of me. - How short should it be? - Really quite short. - I won't be staying over tonight. - Really? Why not? You know I'm leaving soon? It's because of my dad.
