Hello? - Get the hell away from us! - It's ok man, just relax. I'm not going to hurt you. What do you want? Nothing. I just want to help. My name is Johnny I work at the Los Angeles teen shelter. I heard you guys were held up here. Is that some kind of church thing? No, nothing like that. We're not going back to the shelters. That's ok. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. What's in the bag? Breakfast. Want some? Wait, Cooper, we don't know this guy, what if he's a creep? That's smart. It's good to be careful. Let me just take a bite, to prove that it's good. When was the last time you guys had something to eat? Tuesday. It's really good. Look, there's a lot more where that came from. We got showers, clean clothes, all at the shelter. Beds, too. Please, I haven't had a shower in weeks. We go to the shelter, and they'll send you back to your stepfather. Hey, wait, wait, wait! Nobody's going to send you anywhere that you don't want to go. We're nongovernmental, we don't give your names to the cops, we don't even make you live in the shelter, we got no curfew, nothing. We're just trying to help. We got showers, food, clean clothes, You can take what you want, and leave the rest. No cops, and no curfew? That's right. How about you just come take a look? If you don't like what you see, you can walk away. What do you got to lose? Let's go. Come on. Here we are. Oh yeah it's just right in here. - No! Hey! - No, stop! Stop! Get in there! Who's this? I picked up some new merchandise. How many? Two. Just like you asked. A boy and a girl. How do they look? How do they always look? Young and dirty, like they're homeless. The homeless kids don't last long, the syndicates are looking for some healthier stock. Yeah, I'm working on it. But healthy kids are difficult, Elena. They take time. Look, I don't care how long it takes, stop whining like a little bitch and get it done. Hey, Emma, get up! Emma! - Hey! - Hey, you're back early! New record. Is this the start of your midlife crisis kicking in? Maybe, I'm thinking about getting a Maserati next week. - Oh, that'd be nice! - Mhm. Yeah, you're not driving it. Hey, did you get a new locket? Yeah, I put dad's photos inside. Are you ok? Yeah, Mom, I'm fine. Emma, it's alright to miss him, I miss him, too. Seriously, I'm ok. It's been a year already. Where's my photo? Oh, my gosh, Mom! I don't need a photo of you, you follow me everywhere I go. That's because you're so cute. Come have breakfast with me. - Mom! - Come on! Eat! - Mom, I'm not really hungry. - Come on. Gosh. You're such a control freak. I am not a control freak. Yeah you are, you're a helicopter. What? I'm a what? A helicopter, Mom. You're always hovering. Where's this coming from? You don't let me drive. Because you don't have a California license yet. You don't let me date. - Who do you want to date? - I don't know, but Mom, I'm 16, I should be allowed to date. You're right, I know. So, I can date? Um, you can date, but I have to meet him first. Ok! I really gotta get going. But, Mom, it's Saturday? I still have to work. But you promised you'd take me to the mall first. - When did I promise that? - Yesterday. Uh... I'll take you to the mall if you eat breakfast. - Where do you want-- - Oh, right here. - Alright. - Alright. - Wow, wow! - Bye! Wow, how are you getting back home? Courtney's going to drop me off, ok? Courtney! - Hey, Emma, what's up? - Hey, Courtney! - Hey! - Hi! I'm Katherine Hudson, nice to meet you. You, too, Mrs. Hudson. Alright, well, we're going to go, so I'll see you later. Well, what about my hug? Hug your mom, Emma! I love you so much. I love you, too. Bye. - Alright, bye! - Have a good time. Bye, thank you. Oh, my God, I just met this guy last week, he's so boss, - You're going to love him. - OK - Hey, girls. - Hey, Johnny. - You look nice. - Thank you. Adam, this is my friend Emma, she's from Wisconsin, so be nice. Oh, Wisconsin's cool! How are you liking it in Cali? It's pretty sweet. Pretty sweet. Well, are you guys down to take a little walk? - Yeah. - Yeah! Alright, let's do it. This is Emma, leave a message after the beep. Beep! Hey! Katherine, good morning. - What a great site. - It is, isn't it? Yeah. So look, I was just going over the plans again and I want to double check that the earthquake proofing is all up to code - because what we have now-- - Oh! Let me help you with this. - Get that side, now you get the plans, I'll get the table. - Ok There you go, good as new! You're pretty handy. Well my dad was a contractor back in Wisconsin, so I grew up on a construction site. The plans, they look great, but I'm concerned about the earthquake resistance, I don't know if we have enough steel in here. Well, I put harmonic absorbers and a base isolation in the foundation that reduces the need for steel cord structure by thirty percent. You sure about that number? I'm positive about that number, but you can double check if you want. No, no, I believe you. I have been wanting to ask you how the move is going, though, because that's got to be a big change. It's great, it's really great. But I do have a random question for you. When I was coming in I saw a missing person sign on that light post. And now you're wondering if your new home is safe. It is absolutely safe. 100 percent. You know, a lot of these kids that go missing, they're runaways. It's sad, they're from bad neighborhoods, and they get into drugs, gangs, and it's absolutely terrible, but it's not something that happens around here. It's not something that happens where you live. In fact, somebody should probably take that sign down, Because a developer is going to come, and it's just going to freak him out. Yeah, right. - Are you going back to the office now? - Yes, right now. Would you mind taking down that sign, actually? - Uh, sure. - Ok. - Ok, good luck out here. - Alright, we'll see you later. Thank you. Hey! What are you doing? Excuse me? - Why'd you take the sign down? - The what? The missing person sign in your hand, why did you take it down? I, uh... Did you find Piper? No. Then put it back up. Excuse me, who are you? Anna Fray. I'm a case worker at Saving Innocents. Saving what? The anti-human trafficking agency. Why'd you take down the sign? Well, my boss told me that you just put it in the wrong neighborhood. Do you know where Piper was last seen? The beh. Two miles from here. Oh, ok. I get it. I'm really sorry. How sorry? You sorry enough to come and volunteer? Volunteer for what? We need people to answer the hotline tonight. Oh... Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I have to pick up my daughter from the mall. Oh, you have a daughter? How would you feel if it was your daughter that had been taken? Excuse me? What would you say to someone who took your daughter's sign down? Ok, I get it, I understand, and I'm really sorry. Sorry doesn't cut it. Don't take down any more signs. So the movie's called Agave? Yeah. It's like the Agave plant. It's a documentary about the origins of tequila. It sounds cool. It's awesome! Or it would be if Johnny got off his skinny ass and finished in. Oh, ok, you know Courtney happens to like my ass. It's true, I do. Are you ok? Asthma. I'm fine. - Care to do some research? - Give me some of that. That's nasty! Oh, no. I'm good. - You don't drink? - No, I'm in club soccer. So, you got to keep in shape. Oh, ok, she's a good girl, doesn't want to get mom mad. Leave her alone, Johnny. I think it's cool that you don't drink. - What position do you play? - Midfield. That's a lot of running. Yeah it is. Boring. You want to get out of here? A walk on the beach sounds romantic. That's me, baby. So what do you want to do? Um... I don't know, what do you want to do? I could shoot you. What? Like a fashion shoot. Take some photos, you know. Yeah, well I think you need a model for that. You're as beautiful as any model I've ever seen. Hey, Mom? Can I go to the movies with Courtney tomorrow? Maybe, if you tell me who you were with today. I wasn't with anybody, just Courtney. What about those boys? What boys? The two boys that I saw you with. - You were spying on me? - No. But I told you I want to know who you're hanging out with. I'm not hanging out with them. Are you dating one of these boys? Oh my gosh, you are so embarrassing! It's ok if you want to start dating. I just don't want you sneaking around behind my back. - I'm not sneaking behind your back, Mom! - Good! Good! I'm glad we got that cleared up. What's his name? What's his name? - Adam. - Adam. Adam who? I don't know. You don't know his last name? No, Mom, I just met him. Is he at your school? He's a photographer. - At art school? - I don't know! Ok, how old is he? I don't know, Nineteen or something. Nineteen! Don't you think that's a little old for you? No, I don't. Ok, well, I would like to meet Adam. Mom, that is not happening. If you're going to start hanging out with boys then I need to know who they are. You can't control who I hang out with, this isn't Afghanistan. We'll I'm your mother, and it's my job to know who your friends are. You know I wish dad was still alive because he wouldn't care. I love you Emma, I really love you. And I'm sorry that your dad isn't here and I'm sorry if it seems like I'm doing a horrible job of raising you on my own, but I am doing the best that I can. Whatever, Mom. I'm going to hang out with Adam, and there's nothing you can do to stop me. Ok, if you talk to me like that, Emma Hudson, and you will be grounded. Grounded, seriously? Ok, you asked for it, 24 hours. - You can't ground me, Mom. - I just did. - You know, I'm going to my room. - No! No! Put your plate in the sink, please. Happy, Mom? Yes, thank you. So my mom saw us with the boys yesterday. I take it that didn't go so well. Nope, she grounded me. - She grounded you? - Yeah, She thinks I'm like 10 years old or something. - That's harsh. - I know. Hey, girls. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. Where's Adam? He couldn't make it, he came down with some kind of flu. That sucks, Emma busted out of mom lockdown just so she could see him. No, it's ok. I got a surprise. Guess who got a new car? You didn't! Black Wrangler. Want to take it for a spin? I'm here with Emma, doofus, we're supposed to go see a movie, remember? She could fit inside the jeep, too. - Yeah. - Oh, no, you guys go ahead. Come on! - No, it's ok. - Are you sure? Yeah, seriously. Ok, love you. - Let's go. Later. - Bye. Coming in. Emma. Emma Hudson, you open this door right now. Emma, I'm not kidding, open the door. Open this door this instant or there's going to be serious consequences. Emma! Emma, alright I'm going to take the lock off Emma! I don't believe it. Hey! You ok? Yeah, I'm fine, I thought you were sick or something. Yeah, that's what I told Johnny. But the truth is, I wanted to hang out with you. Just the two of us. That sound ok? Yeah, that sounds great. Alright. Come on. This is Emma, leave a message after the beep. Beep! Emma, listen, I'm sorry, can you just please call me back. You're scaring me now. Please! So, um, when did you move out here? About a month ago. Do you like it? Yeah. I like-- - Hey, wow, you ok? - Um... Let me help you, let me help you. - Come to the shade. - I don't really feel that good. Wow! You ok? Yeah, yeah, it's she's kind of a sweet girl. ..., get your head together, kid. - Did you do the checklist? - Yes, just like you said. - Parents? - Father's dead. What about the mother? They just moved here from Wisconsin, so she doesn't know anybody. Phone? I got it. Alright, Romeo. Get working on the next one. Make sure they're nice and clean. We got orders coming in. No, no, Courtney! No! Stop! Courtney! No! Please! No! I found you. My name is Melena. I know you must all have a lot of questions what's going to happen to you, When are you going to see your families again, I'm going to answer those questions. I'm going to tell you the truth because the sooner you accept the truth, the easier your new lives will be. Your old lives are over. You will never see your families again. If you try to escape, we will track you down and we will find you. We have your home addresses, your student ID's, we know where your families live. If you try to escape, we will kill your mother, your father, your sister, your brother. You all belong to me now. You are my property. And because you're my property, I'm going to take good care of you. And in return, you're going to work for me. It's important that you understand the rules. I want to be clear about my expectations so that there are no misunderstandings. Most of the men that you'll be dating are nice guys, they're just a little lonely, a little sad. They have crappy lives, and they just need some attention. A little fun. That's your job. Make them feel good about themselves, make them feel special. You do that, And we will all get along fine. You don't, you fail to satisfy one of my customers, and you will be starved. You fail a second time, And you will be beaten, A third time, and I will give you to my men. Now, how many of you are virgins? Come on, I'm going to find out sooner or later, Virgins are very special in my business. They're worth a lot of money. So... how many of you are virgins? One. Two. Three. That's good. That's good. Get them cleaned up and ready for the photo shoot. Emma! Em! Emma? 911, what's your emergency? My daughter, she's missing. Ok, ma'am, what's your location? I'm at the North Alley Mall. Alright, we have a car in route to that location. - We just have a couple more questions for you. - Ok. How old is your daughter? She's sixteen. Can you describe her for me? She has blonde hair to her shoulders, blue eyes, 5'5", about 108 pounds. What is she wearing? I don't know. You don't know? I haven't seen her since last night. Stay where you are, we'll be there soon. Mrs. Hudson, I'm Detective Richmond, this is Detective Cordova. I called you an hour ago. I'm sorry about that ma'am, Is your daughter still missing? Yes, I haven't seen her since last night. Has she ever run away before? She didn't run away, I found her phone in a dumpster. - Can you show us? - Yes. There's missing person signs all over the neighborhood, and I found her phone in this dumpster and I'm scared that she's been abducted. - Well do you have any evidence to suggest she's been abducted? - No. Chances are she's just fine. Can I see the phone? Yeah. We'll check it for fingerprints. Ok, how long is that going to take? - About a day or so. - A whole day? Did you call Emma's father to see if she was there? No, he passed away a year ago. Grandparents, any other family members? No, no. We moved here a month ago from Wisconsin. We don't have any family except for each other. Mrs. Hudson, dispatch told us you didn't know what your daughter was wearing today, why was that? Because we got into a fight last night, I grounded her, and she snuck out of the house this morning. What was the fight about? This boy that she met, Adam. What's Adam's last name? - I don't know. - You don't know? I don't know, she just met him. Well, how did you find her phone? I traced her from her tablet. And you tried calling her phone earlier today? Of course I tried to call her. Like 20 times. Maybe that's why she threw it in the dumpster. No, she wouldn't have thrown her phone in the dumpster. We've seen it before. But I know my daughter. She's not officially been missing for 24 hours. I told you that I-- We can put her description on the National Crime Information Center. Under what? Under missing persons. What about an Amber Alert? We could do that or a search party? Like my partner said, we'll put her on the NCIC. That's the best we can do right now. What can I do? You can call on your friends or family and see if anyone's heard from her. Here's my card, my number, and email. Email me a photo of your daughter and we'll put it on the site. I have one on my phone, I can do that right now. The best thing you can do right now is just go home and wait by the phone. That way, if she comes home or calls, you'll be there for her. Just let us handle it from here. Ok. Emma! Emma! Come on, get around. Move it around and come in a line. Bring it around, form line over here. Hello, ladies. We're going to shoot some stills and a little video. You're going to stand on this carpet, and smile for the camera just like the beauty queens you are. If you work hard, we'll give you some food. First up, Courtney, let's go. Please, Johnny, let me go. I just want to go home. This is your home now. Please. Please. You said you loved me. And I do love you. Now go stand in the middle of the carpet. Yeah? Let's see that beautiful smile. Very nice. Now for the video part, I just need you to twirl around. I can't do it, I can't. Ok, we don't have time for this. I got to upload this video in less than three hours. Ok... let's try something else. Ivan... That's what's going to happen. Thanks buddy. I like you Courtney, I don't want to hurt you. Melena hates it when we damage the merchandise. You're going to stand up right now, and smile. Melena has specific clients who enjoy torture and pain. You have a choice, You can get up right now and smile at the camera, Or they will make me film Ivan carving you like roast pig. Well, what are you going to do? Ok. I'll do it. Ok, ok. Ok, now I just need you to look right here, and see that beautiful smile. Come on, don't be shy now. Twirl as well. Beautiful. Nice, got it, all done. Next, Emma, get out here. Get over there. Ok, yeah, just stand right here. Same drill. - Hi, Dooley. - Oh, hey Mrs. H, how are you? Actually, I'm not so good. I'm looking for Emma, you haven't seen her, have you? Hi, Lacy. Katherine Hudson! I thought you forgot about me. I don't mean to be rude but I didn't call to catch up, I was just wondering, have you heard from Emma? Hey, Bobby. Oh, hey, Kat! How ar-- I'm not doing so great, listen, you haven't heard from Emma, have you? Emma! Emma! Hello! Hello, ma'am, would you like to lower your monthly payment-- What? Don't call here again! - This is a one-time offer. - Shut up! Get yourself together. This is Anna. Hi Anna, this is Katherine Hudson, I met you yesterday. I met a lot of people yesterday. I was the one taking down the missing person poster outside of the construction site. Right. Piper's sign. You going to come in to volunteer? Listen, my daughter's gone missing, and I don't know what to do. You better come into the office. Hey, are you awake? Yeah. What's your name? Piper. You? I'm Emma. We have to get out of here. You can't. We have to try. You got a family? My mom. Do you love her? Of course. If you try to run, they'll kill her. No, they're just saying that to scare us. They killed a girl last week. What? Maddi. She cut her arm and used the blood to slip out of her handcuffs. She made it to the top of the gate. Then one of the guards grabbed her. She landed bad, broke her leg. They just left her there, screaming, until Melena arrived. Then they brought out these dogs, pit bulls, They ripped her apart. What? She didn't stop screaming until she was dead. But, that makes you guys all witnesses. Exactly. None of us are getting out of here alive. - Katherine? - Yes Come on in. Thank you so much for seeing me. Can I get you a coffee? No, I'm wired enough as it is, thank you. I know, sorry. Do you have kids? No, we hold group therapy sessions here after we rescue the kids. We try to make it feel like home. Here you go. Ok, look, before we get started, - I'm got to ask you a couple of questions. - Ok, sure. Is there any reason why Emma would have run away on her own? No, not that I can think of. Is there a history of sexual abuse in your family? What, you mean me? - Or your husband, uncle, brother? - No, absolutely not. You sure? Yes, positive. Ok. What have the police told you? They said I should stay home just in case Emma calls, but I can't do that, I forwarded my home phone to my cell, I'm going out of my mind. The police won't help you. It's not a priority to them. But they said that they were putting Emma's description out on the NCIC as a runaway. That's just so they can detain your daughter if they happen to find her. It doesn't mean that they're actively looking. Look, if you want to find Emma, you're going to have to do it yourself. Where do I start? Alright, the first thing is to get her up on NCMEC - What's NCMEC? - It's the National Center for Missing and Exploited Youth. Will they help us find her? They might. But honestly, we have to move fast. Most of these girls are moved and sold - within 48 hours. - Wait, what? Sold? What are you talking about? Has Emma met anyone recently? A new boyfriend? Yes, Adam. He's the boy that we were fighting about. It's called the Romeo trap. Traffickers lure young girls by showering them with attention, telling them they love them, gaining their trust, and then the girls are never seen again. California is the largest hub for sex trafficking in North America. Girls are quiet. Yeah, I had Mike put something in their milk. They'll be out until tomorrow morning. How'd the photo shoot go? I'm just editing the video for the syndicate now. What about the stills? Got them posted on Craigslist and Backpage under town gigs, show biz, and auditions. Dates are coming in to the hotel tomorrow. Save the virgins for the syndicate because they're paying top dollar. You got it. How's your boy Adam holding up? He's good. He's ready to come into the outfit full time. You can vouch for him? Of course, we grew up together. Because Mike said that he looked a little freaked out when he brought the new girl in. The first girl is always the hardest, don't you remember? Alright, bring him in, but if he screws up, it's on you, it's your responsibility. Thank you, Melena. You won't regret this. I hope not. - Over here, you ever heard of Backpage? - No. What about Craigslist? Sure, where you sell stuff. Yeah, like girls and boys. How can it be out in the open? Selling kids, it's illegal. It is. That's why the victims are listed as talent. The perverts that go to these listings call themselves hobbyists. But really, they're Johns. The traffickers have different codes describing what the girls will do. I don't understand this. Ok, Desire, her professional name. She's claiming to be 18. Claiming? She's probably 16. GFE refers to the Girlfriend Experience, means she's going to be sweet and loving. Oh, my God. And 150 roses means she costs 150 dollars. So, she's a prostitute? Prostitutes have a choice. Nine times out of ten, these girls don't. They're sex slaves. - Why don't the police-- - Do anything? The cops don't see these children as the victims, they see them as the criminals. So when they bust one of these child brothels, they don't take the girls to the hospital, They take them to jail. 90 percent of the girls in juvenal hall are there for prostitution. That is so sick. Yeah, and that's after they've been forced to have sex up to 15 times a day. Is this going to happen to Emma? We don't know that yet. Well, this... What about TV, can't we put her photo on the news? It's not a news story just yet. Not until we have hard evidence that she's been abducted. Well, what can I do? Because I have to do something. I am going to help you. We are going to find Emma, ok? We're going to work together. We're going to check her phone records, social media, Snapchat, Facebook... We'll get the word out. - Hi, my daughter is missing. - Missing person. If you see her, call me. Hi, this is my daughter, she's missing. Will you pass this around? Hi, excuse me, can I leave you with a couple of these? My daughter's missing. Excuse me, ma'am. Ma'am, you don't have permission to do that on mall property. My daughter's missing. I'm sorry to hear that, but you can't just be handing out missing person's posters. You're disturbing our customers in the mall. This was the last place her daughter was seen. Have you contacted the police? Of course we have. Well then you should let them handle it. They're not doing anything about it. I'm sorry to hear that ma'am but like I said-- What if this was your daughter? Excuse me? What if your daughter was missing? Look, I know your concerned-- No, you don't know anything about me! Look, she found her daughter's cell phone in one of your dumpsters. Listen, families come to our mall to shop, kids come here to hang out, it's a safe place. It is. Now once in a blue moon a kid goes missing and understandably, parents get very upset, But every time that's happened, turns out that the kid went home with a friend and forgot to check in with their parents. Ma'am, I want to help you, but this is a safe area, Kids don't just disappear. How long do you keep your security footage backed up? 30 days, standard procedure. Have the police reviewed it? No, they haven't asked to. It might show us what happened to Emma. That's against corporate policy, I can't. You said you wanted to help. I do, but my hands are tied here. If Emma's not on that tape that means that she wasn't here. Then we can go and look some place else, and maybe find her, please! This is my daughter! Please, I'm begging you. Ok. Ok, let's go take a look. Follow me. Bobby, give us the room. Take a break. Thanks. Ok, so all the security footage is stored here. She would have been here yesterday around 10:12, something like that. Ok. This is ten o'clock. I'll scan through it double-speed. Wait, wait, can you go back a couple seconds? Oh, my God, there she is! Ok, I should be able to track her from camera to camera. Ok, keep going. There she is. That's Adam, the boy that she was with. They're there. Oh, my God, what happened to her? I think he drugged her. Where did she go? Where is she? That's the maintenance corridor, we don't have any cameras in there. What about the parking lot? Those cameras are for loss prevention, We don't have any on the lot. We have to go check out that corridor. I need you to call the police, ask for detective Cordova and tell her what we saw. Cordova, you got it. It's just up ahead. Oh my god, that's him, that's Adam. Ok, no, hold up, Katherine. Be smart. Ok, let's follow him and see where he takes us. When he gets in his car, we're going to lose him. Take it easy, you follow him on foot, I'll go get your car. Go, come on! He's getting away! Katherine, its ok, I don't want to get too close. You've got to get closer. I don't want to lose him at the light. Yeah, I'm on it. Sit, hold tight. Katherine! Katherine get back here. The movie's called agave, it's a documentary about the origins of tequila. There he is. Hey! Wow, wow... You're Adam, right? Who wants to know? I'm Emma's mother. I don't know what you're talking about. - Emma. Emma Hudson. - What? She's my daughter and she's missing and we have surveillance footage of you with her and I want to know where she is. Where's my daughter? You're crazy, lady! I've never seen that girl before. Just get out of here, ok? - Does that ring a bell? - Get away from me! Ok, ok, If you help me get Emma back and you will never see me again. But if you don't, I'm going to the police. The police, no, you do not want to do that! Tell me where my daughter is or you're going to die in jail, do you understand me? Ok, ok, I understand. Ok. No! No! Katherine! Hey! - Where is she? - Get off of me? Inhaler, I need my inhaler! This inhaler? This is what you need? Yes! I need it. Then you better tell me where my daughter is. Please! Katherine! What are you doing? Inhaler! Oh, Adam, that doesn't sound good! It sounds like your throat is closing up! You're going to die if you don't tell me where my daughter is. I don't know where she is, I swear to God. Where did you see her last? Yesterday, I delivered her to Mike's van like I was told. - What van? - Give me my inhaler! No! Who is Mike? - I don't know! - Yes, you do! - Give me my inhaler! - Where can I find Mike? He works for a moving company, that's all I know. Please, I can't breathe! You better call the cops. They're coming. Are you ok? Oh, my God! He's been shot! Oh, my God! - Melena, Melena. - What? What about Melena? Who's Melena? Mike works for Melena. If someone finds your daughter, talk to Melena. No! No! Hey, I need you to get a delivery truck and clear out the warehouse. We're moving. - Right now? - Yeah, right now. We're booked pretty solid for pink. Want me to cancel? No, we're good to go. - What about Johnny? - He's going to be fine, he's probably on a beach in Mexico somewhere. I already gave my statement to the police. Ma'am can we talk to you? Fine. You could have gotten yourself killed. Well, maybe that would have gotten your attention. You got something to say, Mrs. Hudson? Go ahead, say it. Ok. My daughter didn't run away from home. She was taken by human traffickers, kidnapped, and you haven't done a damn thing about it. We've put out an APV for Emma. We notified the FBI. Oh, you notified the FBI, great. How long until they sit up and pay attention? My daughter is going to disappear in 12 hours. Sold as a sex slave. Do you understand that? She's 16 years old. 16! So you'll excuse me if I don't feel like sitting home and being patient, I am going to find her with you or without you. Let's start with Craigslist and Backpage. Looking for recent postings. Ok, these are from the last 24 hours. New talent, just arrived in town. No. No. No. No. Next. Come on, get in the van. Let's go. Come on. Mike! No, stop! Stop! Stop! Next. No. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Next. Katherine. Click on the next link. - Why don't we take a little-- - Click on the next link. Ok. No. Wait, that's Courtney. Emma's friend? Yes. These girls are being worked out of Sun Valley, at the pink motel. Where's Emma? This is the last link in the group. No it can't be the last link. Where is Emma? What'd they do with her? Have they sold her? Not necessarily. They could be saving her for a private buyer. But we have Courtney, isn't that enough evidence to get the cops involved? An online add is not enough to get them out there. We still need hard evidence. What if I pretend to buy her for an hour? Courtney? Yes, what if I pretend to be one of these perverts? That is not going to work. Why? They have female clients, right? I've never heard of that? Anna, you keep telling me that I'm running out of time. And I don't know what else to do, so if I don't talk to Courtney, then I might not see Emma again, so please, get me a time slot with Courtney. Done. Appointment number 58. You got an hour to get over there. Hey. If they catch you, they will kill you. I don't care about my life. They'll kill Emma, too. Well, do you think Emma wants to live like this, do you think she wants to be a sex slave? Of course not. This happened to you, didn't it? I ran away from home when I was 14 I lived on the streets for a while before they picked me up. They put me in a warehouse in Texas. They starved us, beat us, and then they raped us. We were shipped out in passenger vans to motels, or camps, truck stops, where ever. We were forced to have sex with so many men every night. Every night. I stopped counting. One night I was taken to a truck stop. Forced in the back. I saw a screwdriver. And when the bastard turned me around I stabbed him in the eye. I turned myself in. The DA knocked in down to self-defence, And I did four years for manslaughter. Ten years later, 1,500 miles away I still wake up screaming every day. The only thing that makes it better is to help victims, So I will help you, I will do whatever it takes. Here. - Take this - I already have a phone. When you go in there, they'll search you and take away any electronic devices. Put your real phone somewhere they won't find it. If Emma is in there, they are not going to let her go without a fight. To them, she is serious money. It could get really ugly, really fast. If I'm not out in 30 minutes, call the cops. This is private property. I have a date. You here for the boy? I don't like boys. I have an appointment, I'm number 58. You're late. Traffic. Are you a cop? You a cop? One-fifty for 30 minutes. Hands up, I got to search you. No electronics, you should know that. I'm going to need that phone back afterwards. Alright. Room number six. Knock yourself out. I'll take it. Room six. Down the end. Courtney! Courtney! Courtney! Courtney, it's Katherine. Emma's mom. - Mrs. Hudson. - Yes. Yes, I want to get your out of here. But I need to know where is Emma? What? Where is Emma? They took three of the other girls an hour ago. Where did they take them? I don't know. Can I go home now? I just want to go home Yes, I'm going to take you home, honey. Just... I got to figure out how to do that. Let's get your dressed. Cordova. It's Anna from Saving Innocents. What do you need? I am sitting outside of Pink Motel in Sun Valley, There are multiple human trafficking victims on site. You got any evidence? I am texting you photos of one of the girls right now. Courtney Halliday, missing for 48 hours. How'd you get the photo? Katherine Hudson, Emma's mother, She is inside with them right now. How we doing? Full house. We got to check the new girls Facebook page, We got her mother sniffing around. How do you know? Our friend on the force just called me. And... They're calling in the FBI, we need to get out of the country. Ok, let's go. Come on. No, no. get up. Up, up. You can do this, come on. We are almost there. We can do this, stay on your feet, come one, We gotta go. Where do you think you're going? I am... I like her, I want to buy her. You want to buy her? I don't think so. Listen, I'll give you $10,000 for her right now. Just let us go. That's a sweet offer, but I don't think you want to buy her. I think you're looking for your daughter. I don't have a daughter. We looked up Emma's Facebook page, and guess what? You're photos came right up. I don't know what you're talking about. Really. We'll see about that. Turn around. Go back to the motel. Come on. Good, you're awake. Where's my daughter? So you do have a daughter? I'm glad we're finally being honest with each other. Where is she? Bring her in. Ivan. Mom! It's going to be ok! Baby, it's going to be ok. Mommy, no! It's not going to be ok. Get her out of here. No, please! Just bring her back to me! It's too late. I'll pay you whatever you want! I'll sell my house. We've already sold her to the syndicate. They need lots of girls for their brothels and it's a big turnover. But she's a child. I have hundreds and hundreds of children. That's what makes this such a great business for me, Katherine. I can sell them again, and again, and again. How can you do this? I don't care about the kids. They mean nothing to me. It's just the money. They're money machines. I was sold to the syndicate by my own mother when I was 13. Paid my dues between the sheets and it didn't break me, it made me strong. I started recruiting when I was 18, and by the time I was 20 I was running the girls. And now I have my own crew and nobody tells me what to do, I do what I want, when I want. And what I really want is money. And lucky for me... ...you raised Emma to be such a good little girl. Which is good because the syndicate, they pay premium cash for virgins. Please, you let her go, you take me. I don't want you. I want you to tell me what you told the police. That's what I want to know. I haven't talked to the police. Oh come on. You and I both know that is a lie. But Ivan, he has a way of making people talk. - Ivan! No, no! No, please, no! No, no! No, don't! No, please! No, no! No, please no. No. Please. We could make this all go away, Catherine, if you just tell me what you told the police. I swear on my life that I didn't talk to the police. Again. That's enough! You know, the syndicate, they don't really like us to touch the face and the hands. But they do still pay if we cut off the toes. And I really don't wanna do that to Emma. So why don't you tell me what you told the police? Please, don't hurt her. Please. Well then, why don't you tell me? She's got ten toes, Catherine. We could be here all day. Or we could make this really easy, and you could tell me now. I didn't tell them anything! Why are you doing this to your daughter? Again. You listen to me. If you don't let her go, I will kill you. I will. You bitch! I am a bitch. And you remember that, because next time it's not gonna be her toes. It's gonna be her head. You understand me? Do you understand me? Yeah? Let 'em in. It's the syndicate. What do you want me to do with her? I don't care. She doesn't know anything. She hasn't talked to the police. Do whatever you want, just keep her alive. I've got a good sale for her liver and her heart. The surgical team are on their way over. End of the road for you, momma. Doctor's gonna cut you open and sell you for parts. That's what we do with the girls when they're all used up. Not bad. We're gonna have to make this a quickie. This doesn't have to be a bad thing for you, momma. Wait. You might actually enjoy this. No, wait, wait! Wait, wait! Wait, wait. Wait for what? Yeah, I'll do it. But not like this. Please. Kiss me first. You want me to kiss you? Please. Get off me! Where did they take her? She's in here. Open the door. Don't move. Where is she? Please. Mom! I'll be back for you. I promise. Emma! Mom! It's okay, Emma. Mommy's here now. Put the gun down! - Don't do it, Mom! - Shut up! You let her go right now, or I will shoot you. You that good of a shot, Catherine? Because if you miss, you might kill your daughter. You let Emma go and you can still get out of here. You think you can come here and mess with me? Please, I just want my daughter back. I will do anything. You're gonna die, Catherine. And before you do, I want you to know that I'm not gonna sell your daughter to the syndicate after all. I'm gonna keep her. And I'm gonna sell her ass everywhere I go. I'm not talking about the classy places. I'm talking about the worst of the worst. Truck stops, crack dens, work camps. The places that perverts go and pay extra money to inflict pain. She's gonna be wishing that I let her die, but I'm not gonna let her. I'm gonna keep her alive. And when she asks me why, I'm gonna tell her, it's because her mother's a stupid whore. No! Please! Mom! I love you, Mom!
