This is Christmastown in the North Pole. One of the things you need to know is that everyone who lives here is happy all the time. One of the things you need to know is that everyone who lives here is happy all the time. Really happy. I mean, really, really happy. Honestly, sometimes it's a bit much. But happiest of all was Buddy the Elf. Well, he wasn't really an elf, but we'll get to that later. Christmas elves enjoy themselves By donning gay apparel Or by singing songs in Santa's shop Fa-la-la, la-la, la-la-la Of course, I always like it When they sing a Christmas carol I like it even better when they stop Night and day, they dance and play They never sleep much either Would some peace and quiet be a crime? Fa-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la Of course, I love each one of them But Santa needs a breather Because they're just so happy all the time - They're oddly - Happy all the time - Ungodly - Happy all the time When they sing until they're bluish Santa wishes he were Jewish - 'Cause they're - Happy all the time - I swear they're - Happy all the time - Bizarrely happy - All the time But there's an elf called Buddy Who makes them look apathetic If he were any sweeter We might end up diabetic He's everybody's buddy But he'll leave your eardrums ringing 'Cause everywhere he goes He has to tell the world he's singing I'm singing It's almost Christmas and I'm singing And I love Santa, so I'm singing Buddy, you're standing on an elf again. I thought the floor felt squishy. Sorry, Ming Ming. That's okay, Buddy. My spine will heal Because I'm happy all the time Okay, elves, you've got toys to make. Yay! Time to go to work. Happy all the time Happy all the time Making toys is so appealing That I spend each morning squealing True, he's happy all the time - Who knew? I'm happy all the time - Happy all the time He's unnaturally happy All the time All the time Happy all the time Oh, no. I made a big mess again. It's okay, Buddy. Why don't you just say it? I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins. I break everything I touch... I keep stepping on Ming Ming. And yesterday, I only made 400 rocking horses. Sometimes I don't feel like I'm an elf at all. Well, Buddy, let me tell you a story I should have told years ago. A story. Whoo-hoo! I love story time. Holy moly! My legs! My legs! - Aah! - A story about your legs? I love it already. No, Buddy. Just listen. Once upon a time, on a Christmas night, I slid down the chimney of an orphanage. Once upon a time, on a Christmas night, I slid down the chimney of an orphanage. While I was putting presents under the tree... a baby crawled, unseen, into my toy sack... and I brought him back here by mistake. Never having stolen a baby before, I didn't know what to do. So the elves took him in and raised him as one of their own. And as the years went on, he grew bigger and bigger and bigger. And as the years went on, he grew bigger and bigger and bigger. Oh. So I'm a giant elf. - No. Buddy, you're... - Wait. I thought this was a story about your legs. No, this is your story. The story of Buddy the Elf. - Well, actually, Buddy the Human. - Human? Your mother's name was Susan Wells. Now all you have left is your father, who never knew you were born. Now all you have left is your father, who never knew you were born. His name is Walter Hobbs... and he lives in a strange land called New York City. And he works right here in the Empire State Building. In there? Ha-ha. Why, he must be teeny-tiny. Hello, Dad. Dad! No, don't be scared. I mean you no harm. This is just a snow globe, Buddy. Well, of course. I bet he's the world's greatest dad. Yeah, about that... So, what's the world's greatest dad like? I mean, does he prefer candy canes or peppermint sticks? Uh, he doesn't like either. Well, the world's greatest dad must have a top-of-the-line, one-horse open sleigh. Well, the world's greatest dad must have a top-of-the-line, one-horse open sleigh. Well, then how does he dash through the snow? You see, like a lot of people these days, he's just lost the Christmas spirit. You see, like a lot of people these days, he's just lost the Christmas spirit. But Christmas spirit is what makes your sleigh fly. And every year, it's tougher to get this old girl off the ground. I guess it could be worse. - At least he's not on the Naughty List. - Well... Can you imagine the world's greatest dad a Naughty Lister? Can you imagine the world's greatest dad a Naughty Lister? I mean, with their beady little eyes and their naughty little hands... I mean, with their beady little eyes and their naughty little hands... always grasping for presents they don't deserve. Buddy. Let's just cut to the chase. Your father's been on the Naughty List for over 50 years. Well, this is it. I'm all set to go. Now, Buddy, are you sure you wanna go through with this? New York City can get a little rough. I've made my mind up, Santa. I've got to get my dad off the Naughty List. Well then, good luck, Buddy. - Farewell, one and all. - Bye. Now, do you remember the way to New York City? Sure do. I go through the Cotton Candy Caverns, brave the Gumdrop Ocean... trek through the Candy forest, then straight on to New York. - Bye-bye. - Good luck. See you later, Buddy. Good luck finding your dad. Thanks, Mr. Sea Serpent. I'm coming, Papa. We'll make angels in the snow Till the snow begins to blow Then we'll run inside and start a tickle fight And if it's too cold to sled We'll eat gingerbread instead And then cuddle till he tucks me in at night And we'll have our pictures taken For the Christmas cards we're making Him and me in suits of matching plaid And when people see us walking They'll be Google-eyed and gawking At Buddy and the world's greatest dad At Buddy and the world's greatest dad So I'm gonna try my best to be Everything you'd expect of me And I promise that I won't stop until I'm done And I promise that I won't stop until I'm done So someday you can say I'm the world's greatest son So someday you can say I'm the world's greatest son So someday you can say I'm the world's greatest son Ooh! Sorry. Wow! It sure is a big city. How am I going to find Walter Hobbs? Walter Hobbs! Excuse me, have you seen Walter Hobbs? - Walter? - My name is Walter. Dad, it's me, Buddy. I love you so much. The Hobbs family is finally back together again. - My last name is Franklin. - Oh. My name is Hobbs. Then you must be my father. You're everything I imagined. I can't believe I found my dad, Walter Hobbs. It's Jerry Hobbs. This is gonna be harder than I thought. Are you Walter Hobbs? Are you Walter Hobbs? Ooh! Sorry. Excuse me. Are you Walter Hobbs? Is that man shouting your name, Walter? Of course not, Emily. He's obviously delusional. Is your name Walter? Why is that guy dressed up like a giant elf? Christmas always brings out the weirdos. Son of a nutcracker! My leg feels like a shattered candy cane. You know what would be fun? Let's pick out a Christmas tree tonight. Brilliant idea. Let's put a dead tree in the living room. Come on, Dad. Where's your Christmas spirit? He's right. You're turning into a grump. Besides, we never do anything as a family anymore. You know I'm too busy for all that nonsense. Hey, why don't you get your Christmas gift early? Uh, look, I gotta get back to work. I'll see you two later. Michael, you know your dad's a very busy man. Hey, I have an idea. Why don't we write Santa and tell him what we want for Christmas‚Äù? I don't believe in Santa. All I know is what I don't want. I don't want a check That's made out to cash Or a corporate regift from some secret stash I'd like a day with my dad - Just a day? - Make that two If you can do that, Santa I'll believe in you Even though it's been years - Since you heard from me - Since you heard from me - I thought it was worth a shot - I thought it was worth a shot - If it's true that you're magic, I guarantee - If it's true that you're magic, I guarantee - We could use all the magic you got - We could use all the magic you got I can get you some cookies If that's what it takes I've heard stories and I know the deal - You just slide down the chimney - You just slide down the chimney - And fix our mistakes - And fix our mistakes - Now, if only I thought you were real - Now, if only I thought you were real - Now, if only I thought you were real - Now, if only I thought you were real If you were real I guess that's our list Our letter is done Is it really a list If it adds up to one? Make him part of our lives - Not just passing through - Not just passing through - If you can do that, Santa - If you can do that, Santa - I'll believe in you - I'll believe in you - Yes, if you do that, Santa - Yes, if you do that, Santa - I'll believe in you - I'll believe in you - So good luck, Santa - So good luck, Santa - Here's hoping you come through - Here's hoping you come through Signed, Emily And Michael too And Michael too Ooh. Hot dog. Mr. Hobbs, you're gonna love this idea. It's about an outcast reindeer whose glowing antlers help Santa through a bad storm. Yeah. We call it Tony the Lite-Up Antlered Reindeer. That sounds awfully familiar. Uh, then what about this? It's the story of a grouchy green grouch who hates Christmas, and then he... Let me stop you right there, my brilliant writers. Greenway Press needs an original story, and we need it now. - What? - Mr. Hobbs... I think someone sent you a Christmas-gram. Oh, I love the holidays. It's him. Oh, all right, let's get it over with. Go ahead. Get what over with? Aren't you gonna sing some dumb song for me? Sing? Yeah, anything for you. I'm here with my dad And we never met And he wants me to sing him a song And, um, I love you I love you, I love you Huh. Security. Oh, hello. Does everyone in New York hug this tight? Merry Christmas, weirdo. Buddy's first meeting with his father didn't go so well... but his luck is about to change. Huh? Unh! - Sorry. - Are you okay? Oh, yeah. Yeah. That car wasn't as big as the last one. Heh-heh. It's so nice to meet another human who appreciates elf culture. Who doesn't love itchy tights, right? I'm Jovie. You must be the new guy. First of all, you don't need to try so hard on the costume. I sewed it myself. Uh, cool. Also, they'll want you to sing... but no one checks in on you, So you don't have to. But singing's the greatest. Santa always says: "The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear." Deck the halls with... Come on. Boughs of holly Where's your Christmas spirit? Nope. Sorry. I don't sing. You should. I bet your voice is prettier than the call of an Arctic Warbler seal. You should. I bet your voice is prettier than the call of an Arctic Warbler seal. - Oh. Um... - Ooh, ooh. It's Santa Claus. I know him. Do you wanna meet him? - Uh... - Come on. - Aah! - Here you go. Santa. Santa. - You mind? I'm on a break. - But it's me. Santa Claus, Santa Claus. Hi. Ah, great. Well, hello there. Ho, ho, ho. Wait a second. His stomach didn't shake... - Oh, boy. - Like a bowl full of jelly. Who are you? What are you talking about? I'm Santa Claus. No, you're not. - You're a fake. - I'm fake? Ha-ha. Hey, buddy, how'd you like to be dead, huh? I don't know how you know my name, but you're not really Santa. - Look, everybody. - Aah! - Fake. - Argh! Everybody, listen. He's a fake. Fake, fake, fake. This guy's a fake. Fake-o. This guy's a fake. Fake Santa. Fake, fake, fake. Fake. Come on, Buddy, the cops are coming. Are they like the guys who hug you out of the building? What? Just go. When can I see you again‚Äù? Uh, after work, I hang out at the ice rink at Rockefeller Center. Uh-huh. I have no idea where that is. Just look for the giant Christmas tree. Go. I love Christmas trees. Oh. Uh-huh. Stocks and bonds. Five percent interest... Becky said what? Oh, my gosh. - What? - Oh, uh... didn't see you there, Dad. I love you. Would you stop with that dad stuff? What do you want? There's no easy way to say this. You are on the Naughty List. Look, I don't believe in Santa Claus and I don't believe you're my son. Now, leave me alone! You got that? But Susan Wells was my mother. Susan Wells? Wha...? Uh, you have another son, Walter? He may or may not be my son. Unfortunately, the facts are pointing towards "may." Then, until we get this sorted out, he needs to stay with us. Yay! But he thinks he's an elf. No, I was just raised by them. It's almost Christmas and there's no decorations in this house. Oh, do you wanna decorate the apartment? No way. No decorations. All that Christmas-spirit stuff is a scam. Dad says, "The holidays are a time for us to make money, not spend it." Dad says, "The holidays are a time for us to make money, not spend it." No wonder he's on the Naughty List. Yes, that's right, Michael. And if I don't come up with a new book idea, I'm not gonna be making any money. Come on, Dad. For once, can you please let us put up some decorations? - Yeah, please. Please, please, please. - Please, please, please. Fine. Just don't go overboard. - Oh, thank you! Yes! - Yes! All right! There's a saying we have up north That helps us put our best foot forth If you wanna deck the halls for Mr. C Make sure they're sparkle-jolly-twinkle-jingley What's that supposed to mean? When a room is gloomy And its atmosphere has called it quits Then you must remember That December is a time for glitz Then you must remember That December is a time for glitz Never stop until each limb On your Christmas tree Is sparkle-jolly-twinkle-jingley Pick up every ornament That's sitting, waiting on a shelf While you're busy decorating Why not decorate yourself? Soon you'll bring a smile To every person you see - I'm sparkle-twinkle-jolly... What? - Close enough. And if you're at a loss Remember the phrase that says To thine own elf be true Remember the phrase that says To thine own elf be true To thine own elf be true For when it comes to Christmas displays Look inside and you'll know what to do You'll know just what to do Put some cheery folderol On every wall and every nook Tinsel up each corner Till it's Christmas everywhere you look Give the world a holiday That's bright as can be Make it sparkle-jolly-twinkle-jingle Shiny-showy-cheery-Kringle Make it sparkle-jolly-twinkle-jingle Shiny-showy-cheery-Kringle Razzle-dazzle, ring-a-lingle I can't lie, it makes me tingle Sparkle-jolly-twinkle-jingley Sparkle-jolly-twinkle-jingley Sparkle-jolly-twinkle-jingley - Wow. - Cool. So Buddy did his best to spread Christmas cheer. But it would take more than some tinsel and lights to get Walter off the Naughty List. But it would take more than some tinsel and lights to get Walter off the Naughty List. Can you please pass the maple syrup? I'm sorry. I didn't set out any syrup. It's spaghetti. That's okay. I think I have some. Cool. Hey, me next. Ugh. I think I'm gonna stick with coffee. - I knew it. - Knew what, Buddy‚Äù? I have the world's greatest dad. Aw, look up, honey. Mistletoe. Oh. We've been tinkering with the story of a snowman that comes to life... named Freezy the Snowman. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We even have a song. Freezy the Snowman He was made from balls of snow, and then... Okay, okay. I've heard enough. Psst. Dad, Dad, do you wanna hear me play the kazoo? Buddy, enough with the kazoo! I'm sorry. But my boss, Mr. Greenway, gets really cranky when he's upset. What kind of an office is this? Doesn't anyone do any work around here? - I ought to fire the whole lot of you. - Shh. I've never seen an office as poorly run as this one. Good morning, Mr. Greenway. Good morning, Mr. Greenway. Zip it. You're fired! - Buy some cookies? - You're fired! You're fired! Fired! Fired! Fired! Fired! What am I paying you for? Get back to work! Oh. When my boss is having a tough day, we bring him milk and cookies... and sing Christmas carols so he forgets his troubles. Buddy, you're a genius. We distract Greenway with tinsel and eggnog, and all that other holiday nonsense... make him feel that Christmas spirit... and he won't notice how lame our ideas are. Oh. I can help decorate. And we can all dress up like gingerbread men and sing. Oh. I can help decorate. And we can all dress up like gingerbread men and sing. Uh, that's okay, Buddy. We can handle it from here. Why don't you take the rest of the day off? Thanks, Pop. You're the greatest. Uh, where's Rockefeller Center? - Hey, Jovie! - Huh? You weren't kidding. That is a big tree. Yeah, my mom used to take me here over the holidays as a kid. It's kind of fun watching skaters fall on their butts. - Let's go skating. - Mm... I'm not very good. Well, neither am ll. I was the worst skater in the North Pole. They called me the triple klutz. Now, please, don't laugh. Okay. Do you need to hold onto me? Huh? - Uh, oh, yeah, Buddy. You're terrible. - I know. The final rotation of my octuple salchow wasn't very clean. Oh. Anyway, so who's your favorite reindeer? Mine's Dasher, followed by Comet, but he can be a little messy. I wish I could still get as excited about the holidays as you. I always say the best way to spread Christmas cheer... Is singing loud for all to hear. I don't sing, remember? Come on, Jovie, singing can be easy Please, stop. It's fun, it's free, and best of all it's... - Totally cheesy? - Come on. All you have to do Is move your voice much higher All you have to do Is move your voice much higher High, low, high, low High It's just like talking only you sustain it And make it sound pretty No. Just sing a Christmas song It's like magic if things go wrong Just spread some Christmas cheer By singing loud for all to hear By singing loud for all to hear - But when I sing, people stare. - That's the point. And if you're short on cheer Think about that year You woke up to find A brand-new snow had fallen The ornaments you made Way back in second grade Untangling the Christmas lights Took your father several nights Your mother claimed that she had proof There were reindeer on the roof Remember who you were back then Let those moments live again Remember who you were back then Let those moments live again Come on, Jovie. Try it for me. Just sing a Christmas song That's it. It's like magic if things go wrong Keep going. Think of the joy you'll bring - If you just close your eyes - If you just close your eyes - If you just close your eyes - If you just close your eyes - If you just close your eyes - If you just close your eyes - And sing - And sing - And sing - And sing Aw, shucks. - And so... - Freezy, the green grouchy snowman... with the light-up antlers flew through the terrible storm... and delivered the presents to the Whys of Whyville. Merry Christmas, everyone. You know, maybe it's the eggnog talking, but this is the best idea I've heard all year. You know, maybe it's the eggnog talking, but this is the best idea I've heard all year. Thank you, Mr. Greenway. We put a lot of work into it. Dad, Dad, Dad. I'm in love! I'm in love! Love! Just sing a Christmas song... You didn't tell me you had elves working here. Is, uh, this part of the presentation? Heh-heh. Very funny. No, this is... Oh, no. Did you leave your uniform at Santa's workshop? That's okay, I have a spare. If this is supposed to be putting me in the Christmas spirit... it's not working. Okay, arm through here. Stop squirming, stop squirming. Ouch. You got me in the eye. Ha-ha. These are too big. You must have the smallest feet in the whole North Pole. Tiny feet. Look at your little tiny fee... Aah! I have never been so humiliated in my life, Hobbs! And I can't believe I almost fell for your song and dance! Your story was terrible! Sir, have a little more eggnog? Please? Tomorrow night, you'd better bring me an original idea! Tomorrow night? But that's Christmas Eve. I don't care! You're gonna give me the best Christmas story ever... or you're fired! - But... - Fired! Get out of my way, you pencil-necks! Wow. - He's an angry elf. - Buddy! - Do you realize what you've just done? - No. Get out! - Out where? - I don't care. I don't care! Just go! You're not an elf! You're not my son! It was Christmas Eve... and Buddy had never been more unhappy in his entire life. Because of those terrible things Walter said to him... he left their home and wandered alone through the streets of the city. He left their home and wandered alone through the streets of the city. Give me another. I think you've had enough, buddy. I'll tell you when I've had enough. Just keep the syrup coming. How can a city so big have so little Christmas spirit? It's getting worse and worse every year. At least you're an elf. You don't have to listen to kids telling you you're a fake. Well, you are fake. You're all fakes. Fakes. We're just trying to spread a little Christmas cheer. And what do we get in return? Bruises on our thighs in the shape of kids' butts. Years ago, kids would light up when they saw you. Now they just sit on your lap and text each other. No respect at all. Used to be I'd stand on the busiest corner Ring my bell And make the people smile Ring my bell And make the people smile Nowadays, they pass me by And who knows why? Nowadays, they pass me by And who knows why? Could it be that old St. Nick's Gone out of style? Could it be that old St. Nick's Gone out of style? Well, nobody cares Nobody cares Nobody cares about Santa They read their list Then you get dismissed "Cause nobody cares about Santa Claus Is this all a sign? Is this all an awful sign? Of a sad decline? A miserable, sad decline I never knew such disrespect Could ever have existed No wonder this whole city Has been naughty-listed No wonder this whole city Has been naughty-listed I kind of get that feeling too Well, nobody cares Nobody cares Nobody cares about Santa The bringer of bliss What kind of world is this? Where nobody cares about weary Fed up Ready-to-hang-the-sled-up Santa Claus? Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no - Buddy, we're home. - Buddy. Where is he? We have to find him, Mom. Okay, Mr. Greenway, we've come up with a couple quite original ideas. - Dad. We need your help. - Wha...? Michael, Emily, what are you doing here? - I told you I have to work tonight. - Buddy ran away, Walter. What's going on here, Hobbs? Sorry, Mr. Greenway. It'll just be a second. Please. This is a very important meeting. What's more important than your family? I'll tell you, snotnose. Money is what's more important. Please, don't speak to my son that way, Mr. Greenway. Well, someone has to, or else he'll turn out like your other kid. I hope I turn out like him. Buddy cares about everybody. You just care about yourself. Come on, Mom. Dad needs to work. Yes, thank you. You've wasted enough of our time. Now, go ahead, Hobbs. Uh, yeah. Emily? Michael? Wait. You'll wanna hear this too. Here's the story. It's called: I Quit. Excuse me? That's right, Greenway. I quit. You wanna spend Christmas on the unemployment line? No, I wanna spend Christmas with my family. Singing, drinking eggnog, and opening presents. All right, Dad. Oh, Walter, it's about time. Let's go find your brother. Oh, look, another fake Santa. You're not fooling anyone with your flying sleigh. I can see the strings. You're a big fat fakety-fake fake. I can see the strings. You're a big fat fakety-fake fake. Whoa. That's the real Santa. His sleigh doesn't have enough Christmas spirit. He's gonna crash. I'm coming, Santa. Sorry. Buddy? Buddy? Where could he have gone? We really need a Christmas miracle right now. Did you see what I just saw? I saw a tiny sleigh Make its tiny way Right across the sky Make its tiny way Right across the sky There wasn't time to think There wasn't time to blink Before it zoomed right by And everything I knew, I knew And everything that you knew too Is absolutely now untrue because Without a doubt there is a Santa Claus I didn't see Santa Claus, Michael. It's hard to be sedate Or keep your head on straight When fairy tales come true Though I can't complain "Cause if I'm insane That means you are too So why don't we make a pact A solemn pledge to be exact That Santa's real? In fact he always was I know I've had my doubts before But now there's proof I can't ignore So why deny it anymore? - There is a Santa Claus - There is a Santa Claus - There is a Santa Claus - There is a Santa Claus - There is a Santa Claus - There is a Santa Claus Come on. If that's Santa, Buddy can't be far behind. Now, we all know Santa's sleigh is powered by Christmas spirit... but there aren't so many believers these days. So guess who's about to have... - an emergency landing. - Aah! Buddy? - Buddy? - Buddy? There's no way Buddy's out here. Buddy. - Hi, Buddy. - Hi. - Buddy. Oh, we were so worried. - I knew we'd find you. Buddy, I'm glad you're okay. I have something I need to say to you. And I have something to say to you. It can wait. This is important. But mine's really, really, really important. Then go ahead. Santa's sleigh is about to crash... because there's not enough Christmas spirit. That can wait. Listen. Ever since you showed up... you've brought this family closer than it's ever been. You've filled my heart with Christmas spirit. This whole elf thing is a little weird, but I know you're my son, Buddy... and I love you. I love you too, Dad. Okay, that's enough. Whoa, cool. Ho, ho. That was a close one. Hello, Buddy. Who's this? Everyone, I'd like you to meet my really good friend, Santa Claus. Walter, I'm very proud of you. You've rediscovered the true meaning of Christmas: Your family. Congratulations. You, sir, are officially off the Naughty List. Yes! Santa Claus! Nice to meet you, Michael. I can't believe this. Now that you're off the Naughty List, Walter... But this is crazy. How is this possible? Just open it, Dad. Is this what I think it is? The skateboard I asked for when I was 5 years old? Of course not. What are you going to do with a skateboard? It's a shirt. Ha-ha-ha. It's a skateboard. You're real. Santa Claus is real. Wow! Whoa, what just happened? Your dad's Christmas spirit just made my sleigh fly. But we're gonna need a whole lot more to get it back in the air. Oh, no. I was worried about this. - What is it? - Is it who I think it is? Yep. Naughty Listers. Yeah, and we're here for the presents, jerk. Mr. Greenway? Don't be so surprised, Hobbs. Of course, I'm on the Naughty List. Time to give up those presents, fatso! No way, Jos√©. Go spread as much Christmas cheer as you can and we'll get that sleigh off the ground. Go, go, go. Get those presents! All right, Buddy. Lock and load. Let's do this. There's too many, Buddy. Hang on. Hyah! Hyah! Okay, let's spread some Christmas cheer. We can't let Buddy down. Buddy? Buddy the Elf? How do you know Buddy? He's the one who told me... the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear. The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear. A song. That's a great idea. We should go out there and sing. Uh, I don't like singing in front of people. Oh, where's your Christmas spirit? Buddy needs us to do this. Walter, if she doesn't wanna sing... If Buddy's in trouble, then I wanna help. Let's go. Come on, Jovie, you can do this. It's for Buddy. All you have to do Is move your voice much higher High, low, high, low High Just sing a Christmas song Just sing a Christmas song It's like magic if things go wrong It's like magic if things go wrong Just spread some Christmas cheer By singing loud for all to hear Just sing a Christmas song And keep on singing all season long And keep on singing all season long Think of the joy you'll bring If you just close your eyes and sing Give me those presents! Buddy, I don't think we can outrun them. We just need a little more Christmas spirit. Come on, Dad. Sing. Show some Christmas spirit. Just sing a Christmas song And keep on singing all season long Just sing a Christmas song And keep on singing all season long Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! And if you're short on cheer Think about that year You woke up to find A brand-new snow had fallen The ornaments you made Way back in second grade Untangling the Christmas lights Took your father several nights Your mother claimed that she had proof There were reindeer on the roof Remember who you were back then Let those moments live again Remember who you were back then Let those moments live again Live again Whoa! I'm okay. Good job, everybody. Santa's got his mojo back. Ho, ho, ho, ho. You want a ride back to the North Pole, Buddy? No, thanks, Santa. I'm happy here. This is Jovie. I think she's my girlfriend. Heh, heh, heh. Hi, Santa. Oh, no. I don't have any presents. Just sing a Christmas song It's like magic if things go wrong Think of the joy you'll bring If you just close your eyes Think of the joy you'll bring If you just close your eyes If you just close your eyes Now, that's the spirit. Merry Christmas to all, and to all, a good night! Merry Christmas to all, and to all, a good night! And sing And sing This is the most amazing Christmas Eve ever! Yeah. I don't even care that I quit my job. I quit my job. What are we gonna do? We'll just cut back on some things. - You still got each other. - And one heck of a story, Mr. Hobbs. A story. That's it.
