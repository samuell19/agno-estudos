She is perhaps Hitler's best-known victim. Her book has sold more than 25 million copies... ...and has been translated into at least 55 languages. She's become a symbol of 10 million souls murdered by the Nazis... ...Jews and non-Jews... ...and, in particular, the one and a half million innocent children. She was just 15 when she died. A miserable and lonely death in a concentration camp in Germany. Yet she is remembered for her faith in humanity. This is the story of the life and legacy of Anne Frank. In Amsterdam, some of the remnants of a once-thriving Jewish community. Every person in this congregation, like Jews throughout Europe... ...has a story of their own... ...of persecution, murder, fear or betrayal. The rabbi spent the first 2 years of his life in hiding... ...sheltered by a Christian family. But one girl reaches beyond all those memories. Hers is not just a Holocaust story, for the voice of Anne Frank... ...stands as a warning to those who discriminate on the basis... ...of color, culture or creed. Her message is as fresh today as it was 50 years ago. The notorious Nazi propaganda film... ...The Eternal Jew. Distorted images portraying an Aryan nightmare... ...of the Jewish threat to European civilization. And this, the family Frank: Prosperous, cultivated, sophisticated... ...and integrated. In fact, they were a German family. German to the core. The antithesis of ghetto Jews. Anne's father, Otto, was an officer in the German army... ...in the first World War. The family had lived in and around Frankfurt for generations. But Otto had traveled the world, even working in Macy's store in New York... ...where a college friend, Nathan Straus, was the owner's son. In 1925, the 36-year-old Otto married Edith Hollander... ...a 25-year-old Jewish girl from Aachen, Germany... ...near the Dutch border. They honeymooned in Italy. Their first daughter, Margot, followed 9 months later... ...and their second, Annelies, better known as Anne, in June 1929. It was a good life in Frankfurt in those early years. One could almost forget the long shadow of National Socialism. But beneath the idyllic surface... ...far removed from the children's world, turmoil. DANGER JEWS Their landlord turned out to be a Nazi party member. And in March 1931, they moved. The bank owned by the family also had serious problems... ...resulting in its complete collapse in 1933... ...caused by Otto's brother being the victim of a fraud... ...and the effects of the Depression, particularly acute in Germany. And, of course, the threat of the gathering storm. On the streets... ...at the rallies... ONE RACE ONE NATlON ...and finally in January 1933... ...the ballot box. ONE LEADER For it is often forgotten that Hitler gained power in a democratic election. For the Franks, the German dream was over. Some of the family had moved to Switzerland. Otto chose to try his luck in Holland... ...where he had prior business connections. In autumn 1933, the family settled here in Merwedeplein... ...a modern housing development in South Amsterdam. They established a settled and full existence amongst German refugees... ...and Dutch neighbors. We moved into the same neighborhood as the Frank family. Many other refugees moved there. And so there was a little bit of a German-Jewish enclave... ...by no means a ghetto, but just a little enclave. Quite often parents would speak German in the street... ...which annoyed us children terribly, of course. Hanneli Goslar My father was a deputy minister in the interior. And he was the chief of the press in Germany. He had really a very high position. And he immediately fled... ...when the whole government stepped down. And, okay, we went to England before... ...but he didn't find a job where he didn't have to work Shabbat. And so we stopped here in Merwedeplein. Life for Jewish refugees... ...as I experienced it as a young child, in a way had its charms. What I particularly enjoyed was that we adapted faster than our parents. Our parents had to turn to us and ask us... ...what's done in this country. And I found this tremendously democratizing. I really enjoyed that part very much. The Franks formed an active social life amongst the other refugee families. For visitors, Anne's behavior made the Sunday gatherings... ...something of an ordeal. She was just what you could call naughty. She had to sit on a table where everything was very beautiful... ...in a beautiful dress and have her chocolate not spoil it. Isa Baschwitz She just didn't want to. She got up and she made fuss, and she... ...drew attention. And then she grew angry. And that angriness... ...that was the problem between the parents. Mother Frank said, "You sit down." And Father Frank said: "Leave the child alone. She's so small and she's so little." So she was allowed to do the things she wanted. And that happened every time. Every time that girl was naughty... ...was impertinent, later on, really impertinent. I remember very strongly that Mr. Frank... ...was seen as an ideal daddy, that he was the daddy... ...because he was so much involved in his girls' education. He fixed his wife breakfast on Sunday morning and brought it to her bedside... ...which was unheard of in our circles. So that news made the round: "Mr. Frank does this for his wife! How great." Otto Frank interviewed in 1979 We left Germany in 1933... ...because I didn't want to educate my children with blinkers. They were not allowed to see Christian friends anymore. In Holland, it was different. Upon her arrival in Amsterdam... ...the 4-year-old Anne was sent to the Montessori school... ...where Lies Goslar became her best friend. Years later, in her diary, Anne wrote this of Lies: "Hanneli Goslar, or Lies, as she's called at school, is a bit strange. She's usually shy... ...outspoken at home but reserved around other people. She blabs whatever you tell her to her mother. But she says what she thinks. And lately, I've come to appreciate her a great deal. " Anne and Lies' friendship had begun on their very first day at school. Exactly in opposite of the door... ...I saw the back of Anne, and she was ringing these little bells. And she turned around, and she saw me, I saw her, and hop... ...we run each into the arms of another. I think my mother went away. I didn't look at her anymore. And this was the first day. Since then we were together really till the end. Of the two sisters, I was really more impressed with Margot than with Anne... ...for rather obvious reasons. Margot was a year and a half older than I am, so she was a model. She was ladylike. She was always composed. She always did her homework. She was just the ideal young lady. I was a tomboy, so I always thought it would be great to be like Margot. Anne was very lively, and I didn't need any model for that. I was lively myself. Besides, she was younger. You never model yourself after a younger child. So I know her-- All the time. I could do that just as well. I will start with the sentence my mother said always. My mother said, "God knows everything. Anne knows everything better." This describes Anne, you understand? I don't know in English.... She knew everything better. Anne was-- In America you say "spicy." A spicy girl. She always was friendly with the boys. The boys liked her. The girls liked her. She also always was in the center of the thing. Then she had something I never saw, not before and not afterwards. She could take out the socket out of the shoulder... ...and she would sit, and everybody looked. And then she made out, and knock, knock, knock. You have to be very careful. You can end up with an orthopedic doctor. She liked it, and everybody was looking at her. And then she was happy. When he came to Holland, Otto Frank set up the Opekta Company... ...a Dutch subsidiary of a German concern, selling pectin... ...a substance used in making jam. The progressive Otto had a film produced to promote the product. In the early days, he had four key colleagues, all non-Jews. One of those employees was an Austrian who'd grown up in Holland. Miep Gies. It was a very fine place to work... ...because we understand all the people in the office. We were very close, was friendly together. He was always our boss... ...but also our father. We can go to Mr. Frank with all our troubles and sorrow. The office boy and general helper from 1933 until 1939... ...was Henk van Beersekamp. Mrs. Frank was different from Otto Frank. Otto Frank was a familiar, friendly man... ...who treated me as an equal... ...and with kindness. Mrs. Frank was a bit... ...well, maybe she had been accustomed... ...to better things in life in Germany. I don't know. Margot was a bit subdued... ...but Anne was a dear. I had lots of fun with her... ...because we would make funny faces... ...which she found amusing. I remember one time I did this: And she always split her sides with laughter. And when I did that, her tongue... ...would move to and fro. But it was fun. She was a great girl. Dutch Nazis putting on a show in Amsterdam in 1938. Though Hitler had infiltrated the police, the civil service... ...even the prime minister... ...in the years before the war, Holland... ...was generally good to its Jewish refugees from Germany. Despite these scenes of Fascist collaborators... ...the Dutch and German Jews believed that they would be safe in Holland... ...far from the F?hrer in their former homeland. Few, very few, tried to leave for safer shores. And Otto and his family were not amongst them. Sometimes I said to Mr. Frank: "You must go out of the Netherlands. It will be danger for you." Miep Gies "No," said he. "ln the first World War, the German came not here in the Netherlands. So they come the second time, also not." And I said to him, "You must go to America." "No, I stay here because I love the Netherlands." The faith of Otto Frank and thousands like him... ...was catastrophically misplaced. By May 1940, Hitler had conquered almost all of Europe. Austria, Poland, Norway, Denmark... ... Yugoslavia, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria... ...and most of France had fallen to Germany's air force and storm troops. Europe's low countries remained as a tantalizing morsel... ...to be swallowed whole. Then by the 14th of May, 1940, it was all over. Five days after the Germans had finally... ...smashed through Holland's borders, the Dutch capitulated. In Amsterdam, Hitler's victory was greeted with black humor. My father made himself look like Hitler. It was wonderful how he did it. Here was the hair and the black mustache. The Franks lived next door, and he would ring at the door and come in. I remember them all, you know, the first moment. They were very frightened what happened. If you could think Hitler didn't come to their house. But it was very funny how everybody was frightened at the moment... ...till they... ...till they saw who it was and what happened. What happened to your father? He died in Bergen-Belsen. The German vice tightened gradually. First they conducted a hearts-and-minds campaign to win over the Dutch... ...their Aryan brothers. THANK ADOLF HlTLER JEWlSH QUARTER For the Jews, it was another story... ...as their freedom was gradually restricted... ...by a never-ending series of anti-Jewish decrees... ...already familiar in Germany and other conquered territories. JEWS PROHlBlTED By 1942... ...no area of Jewish life was excluded from German control. Jews Prohibited By Law Everything that was fun in life was forbidden. We were not allowed to go anymore to a park or to a swimming pool. We were not allowed to go to shops. Only to Jewish shops and only between 3 and 5. 8:00 in the evening you had to be at home. You had to wear the star. You had to have something with you that would look if you are Jewish or not... ...even if you had the star. Then things were-- You were frightened. You just wouldn't go out. To school and home, and that's it, yes. How one of the friends of Anne said: "Everything I did, I was afraid it is forbidden." Well, the effect of these restrictions... ...was, I think, mainly... ...because it came inch by inch, very slowly. "lf that's all, we can bear it." We always had a stiff upper lip, and we tried to make the best of it. If you can't go to public school anymore... ...there are good Jewish teachers. If you can't go to concerts, which was important in my family... ...there are fine Jewish musicians, so we make music at home. So we always tried to put the best spin... ...on whatever happened. And that way, I think, we tried to ward off... ...thinking about how we were being more restricted... ...and what was going to be sure to come afterwards. Otto Frank, always the perfect father... ...rented movies to show the girls on the living room wall. Rin Tin Tin was a particular favorite with Anne. She and her friend Jacqueline van Maarsen created a cinema of their own. Together we made little cards to get in. Of course, everybody could come in, but we wanted to make it look real... ...by making these little tickets. "Jacqueline van Maarsen... ...is invited on Sunday, the 1st of March... ...with Anne Frank, Merwedeplein 37... ...1 1 :00... ...for... ...a movie. Without this card, no entrance. Please inform in time. Row 2. Seat 2." THE LlGHTHOUSE BY THE SEA WlTH RlN TlN TlN This film supplied the entertainment for Anne and her friends... ...when they celebrated her 13th birthday... ...her last in freedom. Her prized gift that 13th birthday... ...on Friday, the 12th of June, 1942... ...was her diary... ...a present she had bought with her father a few days before. From the beginning, Anne addressed her diary as a special friend... ...with whom she would conduct a secret correspondence. Her first entry was this: "I hope I will be able to confide everything to you... ...as I have never been able to confide in anyone. And I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support. " Her early diary jottings were typical of a 13-year-old: Gossip about school friends, jokes... ...and a record of her unextraordinary daily life... ...together with photos and other scraps. In the years that followed, she also shared her most intimate secrets... ...including her increasing interest in the development of her body and in sex. What interested Anne very much was sexual behavior... ...and she wanted to know what it was all about. Jacqueline "Jopie" van Maarsen And she asked her father about it. I knew much more than she did... ...because I had my sister, who told me everything. So I thought, "Well, I'm not going to enlighten you altogether. You just ask your father." At the time, Anne's body was not changing yet. And I think that she was curious... ...because she had some little.... She used a bra from Margot with cotton wool in it... ...to show a bit of breast. And I did not need that kind of thing... ...and she was interested to see exactly.... While Anne was innocently absorbed with her developing body... ...Otto Frank was mindful that if the Nazi measures against Jews... ...continued to their inevitable conclusion... ...he and his family would need to take precautions to protect themselves. For a year, he had been secretly preparing a hiding place for them all... ...together with his German business associate Hermann van Pels... ...van Pels' wife, Auguste, and son, Peter. It was to be in several rooms behind the company offices on Prinsengracht... ...in central Amsterdam. Laboriously, and unknown to all but the innermost circle... ... Otto accumulated furniture, cooking implements... ...bedding and clothes. At the Frank home, two and a half miles away in Merwedeplein... ...Sunday, the 5th of July, 1942, was the day that everyone had dreaded... ...had hoped against hope would never come. That Sunday, the Germans delivered... ...this innocuous document by registered mail... ...to several thousand Jews, the majority of them of German extraction... ...aged between 15 and 40. They were to report within 9 days to be transported to a labor camp... ...in Germany. Margot Frank was one of them... ...throwing her family, like so many, into crisis. The agonies at that moment were when you had some youngsters saying: "Labor won't floor me. I'm strong. I can do whatever's asked of me. I'm going and that's it." And the parents would say, "No, stay. It's going to be the end of your life." So you saw the family in tension. Then you had other families where a youngster would say: "l don't want to go. I'm scared. What will happen?" The parents would say: "You must go. Remember, grandmother lives with us and the baby. If you don't go, we'll be punished." And you saw the families really... ...torn asunder by these events. And that was terrible. Nine years after fleeing Germany, the Franks were on the run again. By 7:30 on Monday, the 6th of July, 1942... ...the whole family had disappeared... ...Ieaving behind an elaborate false trail... ...indicating they had fled to Switzerland. We came here... ...and the kitchen was not.... The kitchen was just left like it was... ...with everything dirty in the sink. I went into her room, and I saw her bed not made. And the shoes that she loved, she'd just received them for the summer... ...were near the bed. I came here, you see. I went up, and I am ringing and ringing and ringing... ...and nobody opens. And at the end somebody opened. It was a tenant. Mr. Goudschmidt. He had the room at the roof in the Frank apartment. He looked at me as if he'd never seen me before. And I didn't know what happened. He said, "What do you want?" "l come to play as usual." And he said: "Yes, but don't you know? The Frank family left for Switzerland." Miep Gies had been given the responsibility of getting Margot... ...who was now in flight from the Germans, to the hiding place. I took Margot by bicycle. Monday morning, very raining. And that was good for us because the German... ...came not on street. And I came with her to the Prinsengracht 263... ...go up with her. She was very.... -Upset? -Yes. She was very upset. I saw it. And when I was standing with her in front of the hiding place... ...I was afraid that she would... ...fall down. And what could I do with her? I opened the door and put her in. Despite Otto's carefully laid plans... ...on their first day there, the family was surrounded by chaos. When I come there, it was terrible. Nothing was okay. And Mrs. Frank and Margot were sitting down on the bed. They could not do anything. There was.... They couldn't accept this situation. But Anne and Mr. Frank were busy, very busy. I ask Mrs. Frank, "Can I do something for you?" "No," said Mrs. Frank. "For today, I have all the things." And then I went down. But the next day, when I came, all was okay. -So Anne and Mr. Frank--? -Were busy the whole day. Was this typical of the family? Yes. That was typical for the family. Now the family was dependent on Otto Frank's four employees... ...who had volunteered to help them survive. Johannes Kleiman and Viktor Kugler supplied Anne and Margot... ...with school books and other reading matter... ...at the same time, ensuring the Opekta Company continued to function... ...even producing record profits that could be used to keep everyone alive. Miep Gies and her assistant, the 23-year-old typist, Bep Voskuijl... ...had the dangerous task of supplying the residents of the annex with food... ...purchased on the black market or with forged or stolen ration books. In one of her first diary entries in hiding... ...Anne described her new home to her imaginary friend: "Thursday, July 9, 1942. Dear Kitty: Our secret annex is at the back of the building. There's just one small step in front of the door, and then you're inside. Straight ahead of you is a steep flight of stairs. To the left is a narrow hallway opening onto a room... ...that serves as the Frank family's living room and bedroom. Next door is a smaller room: The bedroom and study of the two young ladies of the family. To the right of the stairs is a windowless washroom with a sink. The door in the corner leads to the toilet... ...and another one to Margot's and my room. If you go up the stairs and open the door at the top... ...you're surprised to see such a light and spacious room... ...in an old canal house like this. It contains a stove and a sink. This will be the kitchen and bedroom for Mr. and Mrs. van Pels... ...as well as the general living room, dining room and study for us all. A tiny side room is to be Peter van Pels' bedroom. Then just as in the front part of the building... ...there's an attic and a loft. " As they settled into their confinement, the chimes of the Westerkerk clock... ...seemed to act as a constant reminder of the world they had left behind them. Before long, the entrance to the hiding place was disguised... ...as a bookcase. But in every respect, what lay behind those innocuous files... ...was untypical of the shelter provided to other Jews. It was relatively spacious, within a city. There were people outside dedicated to helping and protecting them. Most families were torn apart... ...but here, all four of the Franks could stay together. A week later, they were joined by their friends the van Pelses. Miep Gies visited each day. When I came here from this door... ...in the middle was standing the table with the chairs. All the people, seven people... ...were standing in the line here. Did not say any word. Did not say any word... ...but waited for me to begin. It was always an awful moment for me... ...because I felt the dependence... ...from these people of us, the helpers. Except Anne. Anne was in the front. She asked, "Hello, Miep, what is the news?" In those early months, Anne was desperately lonely... ...and always hoping for news of her friends. She even invented a correspondence with one of them. "September 25, 1942. Dear Jacqueline: I'm writing this letter in order to bid you goodbye. I can't write to everyone, and that's why I'm just writing to you. I'd be grateful if you'd be really nice... ...and keep up a secret correspondence with me. All inquiries to Mrs. Gies. I hope we'll meet again soon... ...but it probably won't be before the end of the war. Well, then, Jackie, I hope things go well with you... ...and that I hear from you soon. Your best friend, Anne. P.S.: I hope that we'll always stay best friends until we meet again. Bye. " I think that she wrote it immediately... ...after she went into hiding. And afterwards, at that moment in September, she wrote it down. She invented in that my answer to her. And then she wrote a second letter... ...in answer to this invented letter. And she must have been very lonely that she invented these letters. Anne also wrote a long fantasy in which she imagined living with her cousin... ...in the safety of Switzerland. When I think that when Anne wrote about Switzerland and about me... Bernd Elias ...it must have been a painful thought to her... ...to realize that she was like a bird in a cage... ...and we, over here in Switzerland... ...were free to do anything we wanted to do. And all her dreams... ...were caged in. And we, the boys, her cousins... ...could fulfill everything she was dreaming of. It must have been a very, very hard thing for her. In the diary, she even designs a skating dress... -...so she can be your skating partner. -Yes. Yes, when I saw that the first time... ...it really overwhelmed me. It made me cry, to be very honest. Especially then that I knew she was not alive anymore when I saw it. I would have loved to go skating with her. Anne also addressed her diary entries to a circle of imaginary friends... ...all characters from a well-known series of books for adolescent girls. Eventually, she settled on one friend, Kitty... ...as her diary correspondent. Anne was always a very curious child. When I was upstairs and went away... ...she'd always wait till the last to speak with me. And then she had me. And she asked everything what happened outside. And I told her the truth. The terrible truth. "November 19, 1942. Dearest Kitty: Countless friends and acquaintances have been taken off to a dreadful fate. Night after night, green and gray military vehicles... ...cruise the streets. In the evenings, when it's dark... ...I often see long lines of good, innocent people... ...accompanied by crying children, walking on and on. No one is spared. The sick, the elderly, children... ...babies and pregnant women all are marched to their death. I get frightened when I think of close friends who are now at the mercy... ...of the cruelest monsters to stalk the earth. And all because they're Jews. " Bloeme Evers-Emden Margot's classmate At the beginning of the class of '41, we had about 50 children. The deportations began in July '42. And then from 50 children... ...all the time, children disappeared. When you came in your class, you said: "That child's missing and that one and that one." You did hope they were ill. But you knew that they were round up... ...or maybe they were hidden. At the end of the school year... ...in April '43... ...there were three children left... ...two boys and l. And we did our final examination... ...together. The second part of the final examination, I was alone. It was very sad. Very difficult. From 50 children, one remained at the end of the year? While the roundups of their friends continued outside... ...in their hiding place, Anne and the others... ...tried to establish a kind of normality. "Dear Kitty: Up to now, our bedroom with its blank walls was very bare. Thanks to Father, who brought my entire... ...post card and movie star collection here beforehand... ...and to a brush and a pot of glue... ...I was able to plaster the walls with pictures. " We were both collecting pictures... ...from the children of the queen. Here you see Elizabeth, today Queen Elizabeth... ...and her sister Margaret. And I also was collecting, and we would change together. We had from Belgium.... From all the queens in the world, we would change pictures. I liked it very much. Anne was also collecting from film stars. This I wasn't interested in at all. I only remember she had Deanna Durbin. This one. This is the only one I remember from then. I never saw a film. I don't remember if Anne saw films. We went to see Shirley Temple films. And here in Amsterdam, we had a cinema, Cineac. There you could see one hour a little film and news. And then it started. Over there, we would go very often. Four months after going into hiding, an 8th person joined the annex... ...a 54-year-old German dentist, Fritz Pfeffer. Margot slept on a folding bed with her parents. And Anne had to share her room with the newcomer. Look, Mr. Pfeffer was my dentist. And Mr. Pfeffer asked me always: "Miep, do you have a place for me?" Then I went next day... ...in the hiding place and tell it to Mr. Frank and the other peoples. They listened to me. Next day, Mr. Frank said: "Miep, where seven people can eat... ...can eight also eat." Pfeffer moved into Anne's bedroom... ...complete with his drill and dental implements. While no one would now lack treatment of their cavities... ...relations between the 54-year-old disciplinarian... ...and the free spirit in her early teens... ...were inevitably stormy. On this corner... ...it was the desk... ...for Anne... ...and Pfeffer. There this.... This gave sometimes troubles with Anne. Anne was standing on her rights. From so till so is her time. But I believe Mr. Pfeffer... ...did not see the importance of a diary... ...for a little child. "Him and his lies. I'll smack his ugly mug so hard, he'll go bouncing off the wall. Anyone who is so petty and pedantic at the age of 54 was born that way... ...and is never going to change. " What Anne never knew was that Fritz Pfeffer had a son... ...whom he had raised as a single parent in Germany... ...until sending him to England after Kristallnacht in 1938. A few weeks later, Pfeffer himself fled to Amsterdam... ...with his fiancee, Charlotte. But his 1 1-year-old son never saw his father again. Peter Pepper Fritz Pfeffer's son We're talking about a girl under very difficult circumstances... ...who first of all decided that my father was not a nice man. Therefore, she called him Dr. Dussel, which in English is "idiot." As far as my point of view... ...retrospectively to the age of 1 1 and below... ...there's a very large inaccuracy. First of all, my father, although being a very strict man... ...was a very kind man. What other people don't recognize... ...is his love of life, his love of freedom. My father was a sportsman. He loved to row. He loved to ride horses. He liked to climb mountains. So if you take a man who's always been active all his life... ...and then in flight he ends up here... ...it's like caging a bird. Weekly, Mrs. Miep Gies would bring a package containing letters... ...and other personal messages from Charlotte Karletta. And weekly, she would take a letter from him to her. What do you feel now about what that may have meant for your father? What it meant for my father... ...is that it is a thin lifeline. A thin lifeline that was the only hope of expression... ...and relationship. Because with Charlotte's letters to him... ...expressing her love, her feelings... ...her news, whatever it was in those letters... ...is the only thing where my father would have... ...the semblance of mental health. Because you're a prisoner of your own mind. For the first time, Fritz Pfeffer's son meets his father's protector. Mr. Pfeffer. How do you do? Fine. I was a very good friend of your father. Do you understand German? I came into contact with him every day. He was my dentist, exceptionally good. He asked me if I could help him... ...find a place, and so I helped him. Unbelievable. Nice to meet you. He was a lovely, lovely man. Do you speak English? Very bad. Shall we try German? Yes, if that's okay, it would be better. What would you like to know? I just want to say... ...two words. Many thanks. Two months after this meeting, Peter Pepper died of cancer. If Anne reserved her special venom for Fritz Pfeffer... ...with the claustrophobia of the months in hiding that turned into years... ...all the adults at one time or another were subjected to the fury of her pen. "September 27, 1942. Some people, like the van Pelses, take delight not only... ...in raising their own children... ...but in helping others raise theirs. Margot doesn't need it since she is naturally good... ...kind and clever, perfection itself. But I seem to have enough mischief for the two of us. More than once, the air's been filled with the van Pels' admonitions... ...and my saucy replies. They tell me I should talk less, mind my own business and be more modest. But I seem doomed to failure. " Otto, the ever-indulgent father, was frequently called in... ...to act as a peacemaker between Anne and the others. Her adoration of him was matched only by her increasing problems... ...with her mother. "I cling to Father because my contempt of Mother is growing daily. And it is only through him that I'm able to retain... ...the last ounce of family feeling I have left. I don't know how I should act. I can't very well confront her with her carelessness, her sarcasm... ...and her hard-heartedness. Yet I can't continue to take the blame for everything. I'm the opposite of Mother, so of course we clash. She's not a mother to me. I have to mother myself. I'm charting my own course and will see where it leads me. " Mrs. Frank was the most depressed of all the people. Sometimes when I go out of the hiding place... ...the staircase downstairs... ...she went with me till the door. I did not understand that. What did she want of me? And once again, I go with her in her sleeping room... ...and she closed the door, and then she said to me: "Miep... ...I am so afraid." She told me all her troubles. But what could I do? I didn't say anything... ...because I was in the same position as she. While Anne and her mother feuded... ...in the second year, she developed a strong passion for Peter van Pels... ...the 17-year-old boy with whom she shared her caged existence. They spent hours together in the loft chatting... ...or simply staring out the window at the chestnut tree. "Sunday, March 19, 1944. I have the feeling that Peter and I share a secret. When he looks at me with those eyes, with that smile and with that wink... ...it's as if a light goes on inside me. I hope things stay like this... ...and we'll have many, many more happy hours together. Your grateful and happy Anne. " Peter van Pels was a blue-eyed boy... ...with very little intellectual capacity. I didn't know him nearly as well as I knew Anne. But he once came to our house when we were reading the classics... ...and he was so singularly bewildered by it... ...that I remember thinking: "My goodness, he doesn't know a thing!" The relationship with Peter waxed and then waned. They cuddled and kissed, but as she noted in her diary... ...Anne gradually became dissatisfied... ...with his inability to express his feelings.
