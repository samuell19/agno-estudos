What's wrong, Gregorio? Who are you, Gregorio? I don't know. There's a dark hand pulling me from the chest... ...from the conscience, from the blood... ...as if they were strings, bonds. I feel like I have to do something but I don't know... ...what or how. So, I see my life like a confused knot... ...and close my eyes... ...to guess which way I'll follow. The Mister is drunk again. Is he dead? Is he dead? He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. He is dead. Proceed, corporal. Hey corporal. - Uhm! The Mister seems like he was killed. Seems so. We have to look for footprints. Don't be stupid, corporal! Marusia's streets are... ...all footprints. Sergeant, all killers leave footprints. Yes, but this killer will be named by the administration. We just execute them. The engineer was killed by those who organize the strike. The criminal walks freely around here. What are you waiting for? Go and look for him. I've only seen the engineer in the land... ...when he hit us with his whip. I haven't seen the engineer. You hold a grudge against the engineer, dirty Indian. You hold a grudge because of what happened the other day. Everybody down from the cars! You are the responsible, fucking cholo! And you! That time, I could have killed him. No, no, no, I didn't kill the engineer. Here are my hands, clean! Shoot him! Excuse me, I have to take him to Iquique to... ...be judged, it is established by the Law. This scoundrel is outside the Law. According to Article 12 of the code of penal proceedings... ... the Escape Law is applied to Rufino Gomez Peralta,... ... Peruvian citizen. Chile, fertile province located in the famous... ...Antarctic region... ...respected by ancient nations... ...for its strength, principal and power. Chile, fertile province located in the famous... ...Antarctic region... ...respected by ancient nations... ...for its strength, principal and power. Rufino was my friend. My brother. Damn it! - Good night. - Good night. It's cold. Give me a glass of wine. Where are you going, buddy? Let him be. This is none of your business. Sebastian. You can't come in. Little brother, they are going to kill me. They are going to kill me. I have a lot of things to do. You speak as a damn traitor! What worng with all of you? Nobody wants to open the door. I know. They'll shoot anyone they find with you. Hide me. Just for tomorrow! Then I'll jump the walls and I'll go away. No, I can't. I'll go down to Iquique. Iquique is two hundred kilometers away, you can't... ...go walking. Fuck! Iquique, little brother. No, you can't walk there. It isn't true! Well, I'll go somewhere else, as a doomed. You will leave your prints everywhere. All the Pampa is full of cops looking for you. I will go up the range, I'll hide in the villages. Listen, Sebastian. ?Listen carefully! You'll see your signs on all the walls. All the Pampa... ...is full of cops closing you in. So, what do I do, little brother? Take a dynamite charge and blow up the barracks... ...you can help us with that. Help you with what? I can't tell you. And now... ...please. Get out of my home. Sebastian! Sebastian! Don't speak when they are about to shoot you! That way they won't notice your fear. Like I told you last night, it could only have been him! Like I told you last night, it could only have been him! It could only have been him! Like I told you last night, it could only have been him! Like I told you last night, it could only have been him! It could only have been him! Like I told you last night! it could only have been him! Like I told you last night! Like I told you last night, it could only have been him! It could only have been him! Like I told you last night! Tell people to gather dynamite. I came to talk about Sebastian. Tell people to gather dynamite, two cartridges... ...each man and bury it in the east wall. But they are going to kill Sebastian. Sebastian made a mistake, now there will be a massacre... ...in the entire north. Tell people to gather dynamite. I knew you were crazy, since I first saw you, I knew it. Hey, why have you turned a butcher? You cover my eyes because you don't want me to look at you. Don't you see? Your conscience shivers. You, do it! I don't know how! I've never shot anyone before! Doesn't matter, at one point you?ll have to! Sergeant, do me a favor, tell my woman... ...that she don't cry, death isn't... Even if we go on strike or not, in two days... ... we will have the army troops here. A strike won't stop the army... ... to shoot us. To stop the machine guns and gun carriages... ... we have to blow up the train when... ... it starts its ascent from Iquique. We have to tell the privates to... ... not shoot against us. We have to send messages. A big strike. A strike that will paralyze... ...the entire north. All the Pampa. We have to focus on that. We have to coordinate us. We have to be a unity. A strike. A big strike. This is the legal weapon of the worker. A strike will be crushed in a couple of hours. We have to think in alternatives. This strike is a warning, little fellows. Nobody must go to work today. Neither tomorrow. The company has escalated the repressions to... ...stop the uprising. We won't be swept away by provocations. You have good intentions fellow. Why do you say that? We know that this not just about the strike. The strike is just one of the steps. For each strike won, ten are lost. So think, it is the time to consider... ... more complex ways of fighting. Although... ... I?m Gregorio too, fragmented. Sometimes I seperate myself... ... I loose myself... ... and I tell myself... ... it will come, Gregorio... ... You look at yourself... ... limb to limb... ... and the will emerges, the decision. Are they on strike? I think so. Speak with the labour union. If they insist in paralyzing the work,... ... telegraph to Iquique. You know, if the strike breaks out, it will spread... ...like an epidemia, paralyzing the entire north. Tomorrow the soldiers will come. Tomorrow the soldiers will come. Tomorrow the soldiers will come. Tomorrow the soldiers will come. Tomorrow the soldiers will come. Tomorrow the soldiers will come. Tomorrow the soldiers will come. Tomorrow the soldiers will come. Tomorrow the soldiers will come. What do we have to do? What do we have to do? What do we have to do? What do we have to do? What do we have to do? What do we have to do? What do we have to do? What do we have to do? They will kill us like dogs. They will kill us like dogs. They will kill us like dogs. They will kill us like dogs. They will kill us like dogs. Again. Again. Again. Again. Yes, again. What do we have to do? What do we have to do? What do we have to do? What do we have to do? What do we have to do? This night you should come, one by one to the theatre... ...use the back door. Those who can't come... ...must collect water... ...collect food... ...and matches. Why matches? To light the dynamite. To light the dynamite. To light the dynamite. To light the dynamite. To light the dynamite. To light the dynamite. To light the dynamite. To light the dynamite. To light the dynamite. Well, fellows. As a result of the election... ... duties have been confirmed for... ...our fellows... ...Domingo Soto... ...Cristo Licantem... ...and our fellow Gregorio have been elected, here present. Fellows, with this information... ...the new board will summon... ...to inform what have been placed... ...in the new steps of our movement. Please, fellow. No, thanks. You are so quiet, little fellow. More than ten days of travelling, and not a word from you. You just read and read. That's good, isn't it? There goes Calles San Diego... ... Calles San Diego there it goes... ... with its little whore. Do you know what the first thing is I'm going to do... ...when we arrive at port? First, I'm going to find me a little woman. Clean, and love her like God wants. And when I have some money, I'll buy me a good hat. And a girdle and pink panties for her. There goes Calles San Diego... ... Calles San Diego there it goes... ... with its little girls. My name is Cristulo and I'm from Mendoza. And I'm your friend, if you want. My name is Gregorio and I came from... ...from Santiago. Fellow. Four of our fellows went to La Coru?a, Pontevedra. Others went to Iquique and Tocopilla. News from Soto? Soto disappeared, they know nothing at his home. Raise your head! Back straight! One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. And you, don't you want to learn? Let?s go. Don't be shy. No, no, my friend, that is disastrous. Attention! Look at me. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Very good! One, two, three. One, two, three. That's right! Raise your head! Back straight! One, two, three. One, two, three. Very good! One, two, three. Fellow... ...we have a meeting this night with Ricabarrio. So, Gregorio, do we count with you? - Yes, sure. - We have to go out of here... ...immediately. Immediately? We have at least a two hour trip. Well, lets go. Lets go then, fellow, Abarca is waiting... ...for us outside with the others. Four fellows went to La Coru?a, Pontevedra. Others to Iquique, Tocopillo. If they get there, Gregorio,... ...they'll warn thousands of workers and it will be the start... ...of a general insurrection. The socialism is a defined doctrine... ...of precise structure. - How are you? - Good evening. I'm going to present you to a fellow. I'm going to present you to a fellow. Gregorio. - Good evening. - Nice to meet you. Excuse me. This way. The essential base of socialism, consists in the abolition... I'm going to present you to a fellow. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. ...of what is now called private property. Replacing it with... ... the collective or common property. Private property is understood as... ...the possession... ...and individual use of the land and its produce... ...of the tools... ...machines and production methods. Socialism wants the freedom of men... ...and the creation of a workers' society. I need twenty men for Pedro de Valdivia! I offer more! I offer more! I need fifteen men for Marusia! You can go! You can't! I need strong men! You can go! I'm paying five gold pesos! What did you say? - If he doesn't come, I won't either. - OK, I?ll take both of you. OK, those for Marusia! This way, this way! There are times, like this one, in which... ...order and the discipline are imposed, not asked for. To fly the flag for one?s country, means to destroy our enemies. It isn?t convenient to kill them all, after all... ...they are the ones who work. That's why you'll never become a cardinal. Quickly, to the administration! To the administration! Quickly, everybody out! Everybody out! Turn left! Everyone, I said! Quickly! Everybody out, damn it! Lets go! Turn left! How many shoots did you fire, Lieutenant? You saw my gun. There were three used cartridges. Do you know why I tell you this? The report accuses you, Lieutenant. You shot three shots and private Macias had... ...three bullets in his body. When the shooting started, everyone ran away... And as you didn't explain us,... ...our people entered shooting like crazy. So... ...two mistakes and six more deaths. Will I lose my job? Your job and something else, I guess. So, report by report. I'll write your next report myself... ...so neither of us will have a problem in... ...this damn report. As your order, lieutenant. The men who try to abandon the camp... ...will be considered as deserters and will be... ...executed in on spot! Your women and children will be severely punished! There won't be work turns at night! Everybody must stay in their homes... ...from 8 o?clock until 6 in the morning! Anyone evading this disposition... ...will be executed immediatly! This situation will be indefinitely until... ...the responsible of these criminal acts... ...are put before a military court! The command is aware... ...that just a small group of individuals... ...is responsible of these vile acts. That's why... ...we appeal to the workers of Marusia's... ...to reveal... ...the name of the guilty. Otherwise... ...this command will from this moment... ...call for the severest measures... ...directed to clarify... ...these bloody events! Take those down! Go! Go, quickly! Move! Take them down! Go! Ready! Aim! Fire! When the priest tolls the bells... Quickly! Down there! There, take them down! Take down that son of a bitch! Attention! Ready! Aim! You have one minute to talk! Fire! Rest! They are tough, hard to die. Shit! These are the ones who want to kill you. No compassion for them, god damn it! Us or them! Speak, you shit, speak! Speak, you shit, speak! Speak, if you don't want me to kill you here. Who are they? Speak. Where do they hide? Speak for your own good, Domingo Soto, speak. We know that you aren't in favour of... ...those methods. Speak, Domingo Soto. ...speak, shit! Why matches? To light the dynamite. To light the dynamite. To light the dynamite. Ready! Aim! Fire! Medio Juan, Medio Juan, the soldiers are looking for you! You have to leave right away with the kids. - Fellow, little fellow. - Yes, Medio Juan. You must leave the house before the soldiers come... ...warn the neighbours. Hey German. For you, cholito. Who is it? Get out with your hands up! Come, in. Don't you see? I'm drinking my vermouth. Stand up! What's the matter? I just returned from the job. I'm eating. What the hell is going on? He killed eight, Gregorio. He killed eight. All of this is useless. We have to find another way. - Come and look for us! - Come on, you fag soldier! Shoot me! Come if you dare! The soldiers refuse to obey! We have to telegraph urgently to Iquique, asking for a regiment! Hey boy, do you like my waist? Do you want to dance some waltz? Come and see if you want all of this! Look! Just be careful... ...a regiment from Iquique is coming. We have to stop this lack of discipline. We have to start the dialogue. We have to reach an agreement with the workers. That's unacceptable! Dishonourable! I prefer being still alive. Sergeant Pe?aloza! Catch five men at random and execute them! - That's not possible, lieutenant! - Do you want to jump with me? Coward old man! Gainza, join the troops in the barracks! Cavalry trotting! Calame?o! Mr. Jones ask for a meeting in one hour here. He wants to reach an agreement with you. The company wants to reach an agreement with you. Now, Tinoco. Ready! Aim! Fire! Is anyone else ready to disobey the orders? Lieutenant Gainza! To the square! It's a wish from the administration to reach... ...an agreement with the workers. The administration wishes to reach peace in Marusia. This reunion is fucking over! ...Two minutes to dissolve. - Lieutenant, I beg you... ...let me proceed the dialogue with the workers. I'm the authority! Dissolve, god damn it! Back, you bastards! Dissolve, shit! Dissolve you sons of a bitches! Dissolve! - Back, you bastards! - Murderer! - Dissolve! - Son of a bitch! Retreat! Calvary, retreat! Domingo Soto. Let?s go, little fellow. Where did you enter? Where we always do. Are there soldiers there? We haven't seen any soldiers. - Look, compadre, supplies. - Yes. The soldiers are gone. You won't do business with the employees. And we don't have money. Hey, Calame?o. Let?s have a drink and talk over there. OK, as you say. Go, there. The roads to the south are clear. It hasn't been raining for a long time. It?s still snowing heavy in the ranges, ...covering the passes. It?s the truth, we don?t have money. And tomorrow... ...the regiment of Iquique will arrive. Do you understand? We will have to sell in another office. What a shame, the long trip wasted. If you go back, you will meet up with the soldiers... ...and they will take your merchandise. We have to sell them in another office. We need that money. The supplies stay here! Unload quickly! It should be stored in different houses! Little portions in different houses! You must look after the water! That morning in La Coru?a, general Shultz said... ..."I don't want any survivors". First we had fear, but... ...everything happened like a lighting. Thousands of bastards fell that day. It was like a pigeons hunt. Then we went over them with the bayonets. First... ...you feel like a tickling in all the body, but... ...once you calm down, the smell of blood... ...makes you feel desire to kill and keep killing. General Brown... ...a brave general. And Major Schiller. Troncoso, do you remember Captain Haisen, he chased... ...us on his horse? As if we were cows. Fuck. Have you thought why... ...all our instructors... ...all our bosses have American names, Troncoso? It's like an invasion... ...slow and quiet. Don't say bullshit. You are a good pupil, Troncoso. The best of all. Why did they send you to the north, Troncosito? Why? - Who are they? - The "sulphates". - Sulphates? - Yes, man. Workers of the sulphate mines. Because of their living conditions they go mad... ...in two or three years. They start to drift around the settlements... ...trying to get inside,... ...they're sent away, naturally. They are human remains, Troncoso. Why did they send you to the north, my captain? What mistake did you do, captain? Fellows, I think we can sum up. So, we said... ..the train is going to arrive at noon. - There are forty kilometers. - Forty kilometers. - There are forty kilometers. - Forty kilometers. We had already said that... ...to make them jump we need... ...sixty kilos of dynamite. - We have enough. We need twelve man to carry it. We have to evade Gainza's guard. No, no, no, that will cause problems. It's not possible... It's not possible. I ask for the word, fellows! Who is there? Is it you, Juan? What do you want? Don't be scared, kid. Back, back, or I'll shoot. Let us pass, I'm telling you. I just obey orders, madam. I have to shoot. Don't you see that we have to go for water? Don't you see we?ve run out of water? You can't shoot us soldier... ...don't you see that we have to go for water? ...don't you see that we have to go for water? You are also a person like us, mr. Soldier. Who is there? Conscripto Rosales, on guard, sergeant. - Answer when you're asked! - Yes, sergeant. Now you have to point us to where to follow the... ...train line? - I won't tell you that. We have to find the path before the dawn. We have to find the path before the dawn. Now tell us the way to evade the patrol. Come this way. I will direct you. Hurry up, hurry up. Nicely done. What the hell is going on? - Don't you see? Stand up, immediately! Stand up, I'm telling you, fucking Indians! Oh, really? Won't you obey? Very good. Very good! Very good. Very good! Engine driver, backwards and right forward, full speed! No, I won't do that, captain. What is this? Insubordination... ...Insubordination! Lieutenant Espinoza, take the charge. Execute him! Execute him, it's an order! Back to the train. Full speed! Now you fucked all up, Troncoso. We don't have another engine driver. Fire! Fire! Fellows. Little fellows. We all know that we are passing... ...through a difficult situation. But we have to stay together, with order and discipline. All instructions will come from this leadership. All instructions will come from this leadership. We let the Englishmen and employees go... ...and we hand over the dynamite. Only that way can a dialogue begin says the captain. No, I disagree. What is it you propose? If we let the workers and Englishmen go... ...we will be executed immediately. If we give them the dynamite... If we give them the dynamite... ...it won't take so long before the massacre start. It has always been like that. And what else we can do? Organize us... ...prepare a defence plan. Until now, everything has happened spontaneously... ...without a real control. This is the moment to establish a well-organized... This is the moment to establish a well-organized... ...way of fighting. We mustn't forget that... ...at this time two of our fellows... ...have informed other demarcations. If we are able to hold out... ...and raise all the north. The army cannot control all the Pampa. The army cannot control all the Pampa. And once soldiers realize... ...that we are an organized force... ...they will begin to join us. From here, from Marusia... ...we can start a new movement with such a force... ...it will revolutionize all the country. It will be a workers... It will be a workers... ...soldiers, students and peasants movement. No, no, it's not possible... ...to make that, we need a lot of time and we haven?t. We are not prepared. We have to dialogue, that's our only way. That is the shortest way to death, fellow. They can't bombard Marusia... They can't bombard Marusia... ...if they destroy the facilities they will lose everything. The company, won't allow it. Tarapaca... ...and Antofagasta. Provinces won by our country in the war... ...against Peru and Bolivia. The value of the natural resources are incalculable. It?s has a concentration of manpower. Workers from all over the world. Bolivian, Peruvian, Chilean French and Italian workers. Settlements are scattered all over the Pampa. Number of workers: One hundred thousand, including their families. Amount of military forces; ten thousand soldiers. It other words, five camps scattered... It other words, five camps scattered... ...all over the zone. Which makes it difficult to control the area. It would be enough with... ...a strong rebellion breaking out in a small place like Marusia... ...for it to extend to all the other settlements and... ...it would be impossible to suppress. This would mean... ...to risk the stability of the Chilean government... ...because the separatist ideas... ...are also present in the south of the country. ...are also present in the south of the country. So, if that were to happen... ...we would be caught up in an infernal circle... ...north to south. So... ...our plan is to remove... ...thoroughly the problem where it is located... ...and in a definitive manner. This is a war gentlemen and we have to act accordingly. If we need to destroy Marusia to preserve... ...the stability of the country and the continent... ...the stability of the country and the continent... ...we will do that without hesitation. Tell Mr. O'Brian... ...that my government considers it better... ...for the company to loose one office... ...than to put in jeopardy the minerals. Mister O'Brian says that he has already spoken... ...with the President and he agrees. The only thing he recommends is prudence. Tell, Mr. O'Brian that he's talking with an officer... ...of the Chilean army and the Chilean army... ...of the Chilean army and the Chilean army... ...doesn't need recommendations It is necessary to take... ...the measures needed. All the Englishmen must be evacuated... ...from the settlement. Quickly, quickly! This way, gentlemen! Come on, quickly! Hurry up, we don't have much time, come on, quickly! Careful, don't push each other! Come on, in order, quick! Hurry up, sirs, quick! Quickly, let's go! Order please, order please! - Women first, help them! - Come on! Good afternoon. I was in Iquique too, when the mass killing occurred. We couldn't believe it. Thousands came to Iquique. They were waiting for the quartermaster. When he arrived, he went to the balcony and promised justice. We didn't notice what was happening. Then the soldiers began to shot. The strike committee, stood up... ... at the balcony with the flag. They were the first to fall. The men were running the streets, bleeding. More than three thousand workers were killed. We covered our ears... ...we didn't want to listen. We didn't want to know. Then they stabbed them with bayonets. During the next days they were working,... ...getting out the bodies First, you put in the gunpowder. Fuse. Then fill it with earth, carefully. The fuse goes out here. Squeeze it, slowly. Now, we take the jar... ...and we put it here. Calame?o. Then we light it. Once the fuse is lighted... ...we count until five and throw. Excuse me, fellow... Excuse me, fellow... One... Two... Three... Four... Five! - Did you understand? - We will explain it again. - Did you see? - Yes. We have gunpowder, fuse... When I was going to take the train. Why do you have fear, Gregorio? No, it's not the fear, I told her... ... but she was always repeating it to me. There's something inside you that I don't understand, Gregorio... ... you are always watching... ... like waiting. What are you looking for, Gregorio? Ever since I can remember we have been massacred. We march with the fists clenched, raising... ... the flags. They come with their rifles and their bullets and death... They come with their rifles and their bullets and death... ... that starts to tear you. So one thinks it is necessary to look for other ways. That is not possible to let them kill you each time... ... so, one searches, one waits. Do you understand what I mean? Gregorio, Gregorio! Artillery to soften, rifles to finish off. Artillery to soften, rifles to finish off. Cavalry to chase... - A drink, Troncoso? Everything ready, Espinoza? - Everything ready, Troncoso. Soldiers of the fatherland's! The enemy is in front of us and we will exterminate him! Long live Chile! Long live! Long live! Long live! Long live! Long live! Three to two, fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Back, Gregorio! Arturo, Calame?o! Your turn, Espinoza. Go ahead, they ran out of bullets. Company to the right, walk! Let's go to the theatre! We have the dynamite there! It?s the only way to resist longer! No. We must separate. I and Calame?o... ...will go to the theatre. You... ...try to escape. Soto. Take this report... ...it contains all that?s happened here. Show it to the fellows. Soto, Soto! You and I have made mistakes... ...but we have failed in the name of reason. We have been divided when we should have been together. We have blindly fallen into the game... ...prepared by the brains of the killer's. We we we... we haven't... looked for other alliances. We acted with hurry. We haven't organized sufficiently. We haven't been able to discuss our problems... ...and look for unity! Go now, go now! Go now, tell what has happened here! Go and work with method, to organize! Go now, go to work! To organize! So tomorrow, the strength of all the workers be united... ...with the conscience, Soto, with the reason. Calame?o, come on. If they run like that... ...is because are loaded with dynamite. Get out of here, get out! Get out, come on! Get out, get out of here! Enclose the theater, by the four corners. Lieutenant, take the charge, a patrol to the school. I need all the children here. Yes, captain. They are my pupils. You shouldn't get involved, lady. Come on! Why do you want the children, captain? They have dynamite, if I send a patrol, they will blow up with it. Therefore, I prefer that the children go with... ...the soldiers. Is this your war, captain? This is my war. - Take them to the theater! - Don't touch the children! Don't do anything until I return. You two, go with her! You have ten minutes! I'm Luisa, the schoolteacher. They have the children. There's nothing to do. You have to come out. They took the children. You won't sleep until you tell us about... ...your fellows' plans? What are their names? Where are they going? - Look for his family. - He doesn't have one, captain. No, no, no. Don't eat like that. Didn't you learn to eat? Didn't you learn how to eat when you were a child? Come. Come, come. Come, come. Look... ...this is the blood of the children of Marusia. This is the blood of your fellows. This is the blood of your mother. Gregorio! You are not a man, you are a beast! Shit in your trousers! All has been useless. Why do you shut up? Let's talk. I haven't hit you, other people did that. You have a scratch on your cheek. When you came back home they?ll have to cure you. Do you want me to tell you something I've been thinking... ...all these days? Suddenly, I started doubting. What? Well... ...about the final result. I should go. Some of your fellows escaped to... ...Ponteverde and La Coru?a. And by now they will be trying to raise other places. The more people we kill, the more appear. Don't you notice that you are weaker? Even though you are many more! Squad one, fire! Squad two, fire! Squad three, fire! Fire! Lieutenant! Lieutenant! On the August 17th, 1907... ... I begin to write these minutes from Marusia... ... with the aim of leaving a testimony that helps... ... in our class struggle. Today is Monday and like all the days... ... Go and work with a method, to organize! To work, to organize! So that tomorrow the strength of all the workers will be united... ... with the conscience, Soto with the reason!
