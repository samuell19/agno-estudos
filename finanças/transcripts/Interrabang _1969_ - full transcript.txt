Stop it, I can't anymore. -More! You're the most beautiful sergeant I've ever kissed. And she keeps on reading. What is it? Read it to me? Is it a giallo? -I can't just read it to you, leave me alone. I'll tell you about it. I wrote it you know? Who else could read this amongst us? Fine, tell me what it is about then. Difficult... It's the desire to eliminate the tragic and boring things in life, right? Inevitably, it all comes back to tragedy. I didn't understand a damned thing! -Because you're stupid. The more I read, the more I realise we keep hearing the same things. It's old philosophy; the elimination of tragedy is a French invention... I didn't realise you were so prepared. -Really? I do like to read sometimes. Here's the oldest essay in the world: It's important to play in life, a game is a path to liberty. What liberty? They all die in the end. Of course, I agree, because liberty compliments death. Death. -You're boring me guys. Quiet, culture is everything. -The usual idiotic conclusion. Fabrizio. Put these on. Fabrizio! -What is it? Give me your mouth, I'll explain why later. Fabrizio! What is it? -I want to know if you're alive? My wife is worried, I'll be back. -Return, I want to make love. You said the same thing when we were in the mountains. Who knows what she means by 'love'? The simplest thing in the world, my dear... Put yourself in the horizontal and wait. What a great description of the love making process. It's all rubbish. -What did you say? It's all a load of rubbish. What? The book you're reading or our conversations? Stop scandalising yourself, life's just a game, isn't that right, dear? A dirty game. -They're talking about the escapees. Have they caught them? Turn it up. "...after a bloody shootout, two of the men were captured..." "Three officers were left injured..." "Time's running out for the third convict, unless he's left the island..." "But this seems unlikely with the coast guard on full alert." "In a separate incident a police officer has gone missing..." Have they got them? -No, one of them's still loose. One's still enough to commit crimes... A man fighting for his freedom is stronger than any animal. It's really beautiful here... The ideal place for us. Really beautiful. It's also ideal for someone on the run. Yes, it's nice, now let's work. -Lower the anchor, I'll get ready. What are you doing? You're like a statue... Hey, stupid idiot, I'm talking to you. Are you moving or not? Come on! Can't I think for myself? -No... ...you just need to pose. -Precisely. No... It's not working. Is this okay? Do something! Raise an arm or two! Think about it... No, don't think. Like this? -You make me sick. Lower that arm, like that. A little bit more... Back a little... Wait. There, like that. If you were an amateur you'd do well... ...but you're a professional, now get a move on! Stupid. Why did I get roped into this pathetic assignment? Not in form today? Cheese! I'm tired, I don't want to. -Give me the other one. You could've prepared, idiot! -Are you nervous today? Stupid. Stupid. Stupid but beautiful. Perfect. More to the side... Virgin... Smart... Beautiful... Now, give me your body... You're the best plastic material in the world. You're here as a model because you have value, as woman you're stupid... ...vulgar and repellent. -As a lover? I'd better not, you'd find it in poor taste. Use Valeria, she's ready. -Enough of women's stupidity... I don't need you anymore, I want to leave... I want to be a war correspondent. Maybe with the negroes? Far from all your stupidity. No, no... Can we try and do one good shot? Just one. Catch this. What is it? An Inca amulet? Why do you carry it? It brings good luck... It's called 'Interrabang', if you look more closely you'd have seen it's... ...an exclamation and question mark combined together. That's incredible! -Sure... It means nothing to a superficial person like you... It's the new symbol of doubt, the uncertainty in all of us... Uncertainty in these times, the uncertainty of the world. Profound, my dear. Don't move, I'll do it. Beautiful: land spotted. The great wait. More land spotted... Change it, dear. Abandon. Stupidity. Temptation. You're so funny! Funny and useless. Fabrizio. What does she want today? -See, if you had to write that... ...you'd use an interrabang. -Right. See, it's the perfect day for a crime... See Valeria, if your sister didn't love you, we could blame Levaso... ...and do away with you! -That's not funny, you're an idiot! Sure, as long as I'm hanging around you. -Do you enjoy tormenting each other? Something stinks round here? -What? Me and him? Not even if I was dead. -You see? Death! It's the second time you've said it today... Death is upon us. I'm coming. Fabrizio. What are you doing there? You want me to take some nude shots? Okay, let's go. Who are we doing this for? Playboy, Penthouse? They'll pay. Be honest, it's a lot of cash. Now, move yourself like that... A little bit more to the side. Why are you so distracted? What are you looking at? What did you see? Why did you look over there? What did you see? I don't know if I saw anything. I don't like this place anymore. All this silence is scary. -Doesn't take much to change nature. Margerita saw someone. Stay in bed and not sleep, wait for someone who's not coming... Try to like but not like, like Valeria. -Fabrizio. I've got one: Want to make love, but have no one to make love to. What's going on? I don't know, it doesn't work. -What is it? How do I know? It won't start. -Damn it. Leave the anchor, it won't start. -What will we do? Just keep trying it. Come on. Come on! -What a mess. It's not going to start. -Now what? If we miss the flight they won't get the pictures. Who cares? It's not our fault. They'll wait... If this boat won't start? -We aren't leaving? What was I saying... That stupid mechanic didn't change the carburettor... Fool. Now what do we do? Yeah, you have a go! You're better at it... Stop, you'll break it. Someone will come here sooner or later. What did you see? What are you watching? Nature, you know I love nature. Tell the truth, you'd like to see the convict burst out from the rocks! What are you doing? Let's dive in. Come on. Stop it! Hurry, someone?s coming. There's a motorboat, come up, quickly. The megaphone. Over there! We don't have a carburettor! They can't see us. We don't have a carburettor. They've seen us! They're coming. Thanks. I'll get changed. What happened? We're victims of a stupid sailor who left us without fuel. Could you give me a lift? -Where to? To the port, if it's not a problem? -No, we're going back anyway. I'll find a boat to bring me back. -A stroke of luck. I'm going. -Go. Hurry, we may still catch our plane. -Hurry? I'm running off with her! Are you coming Margerita? -No, Margerita stays here. Three women alone are a force to be reckoned with... Don't do anything silly. Let's go, Ciao! Did you see how she was taken by Fabrizio? What do they see in him? -Like that English journalist said; Remember? I never read what the papers say about you. He said he was fun, stable, stupid, irresponsible, evil and nasty... Above all, an old man pretending to be young. How come you remember it so well? -I have a good memory... He's so charming. -To those who don't know him... To those who know him well, he can be a nightmare. Do you love him? -I think so... If I do, it's for him, not his mind. Besides, he loves me. -It must be nice being so secure. Margerita is diving in! -Margerita... Know how many of them there have been? -You mean you're not jealous? Fabrizio is mine, he didn't have a past, he never had a childhood... He was thirty when we met, I started his fascination... His teasing, his presumptuousness. His future. But Margerita is important for him. Sure, at the moment, but then? A real photographer needs a model who's all his own, personal... It's a difficult match but when it works, it's marvellous... Incredible fortune. -Incredible fortune? How different we are! I'd never adapt, even with incredible fortune. Hey, you! I saw you earlier. I know. -Come in, the water's hot. I can't swim. What does that mean? -I'd drown. Strange, I thought you were a sailor. Valeria. I don't like that guy who's with you. -Pardon? No, I don't like him. I don't believe his story about the fuel. What's your name? -Marigaleta. Sounds nice. What does it mean? -In Greek it's Margerita. I say he's not coming back. He's not coming back. He's coming back, he'll come back for me. Why? What do you do for him? -We work together... We work and sleep together. -The toughest thing in the world. I know but when it works, it's great. Why does he need you? -I'm his personal model... Every good photographer has one; private property! You're not beautiful. A real model doesn't have to be beautiful, she has to be different. I know, you must be different to the others; from the future. For a local, you're well informed, how do you know all this? I'm not a local, I come here to write... I write poetry. -Are you important? Sure. -Famous? No, real poets aren't famous, I use my instincts... This is why you're perfect, because you're very... ...particular. What are you looking at? Margerita's on the attack! I live up there, come, I'll show you. Wait. Turn around very slowly. Describe that boat? -It's a yellow boat. Does it look like police? -Yes... Why? Nothing. -What a day! Come here... Smile. Smile! Who are they? -A couple. Sure, what else would they be doing? She' not bad! Our carburettor?s broken my husband's gone to get one. The others? -One is my sister, the other's a model... We came here to do a fashion shoot... Is this an interrogation? -I'm sorry, we're looking for those three... I'm sure you've heard? -Yes, are we in a danger zone? I hope not, two have been captured, the third will be caught soon. Is he dangerous? -No, but you never know. Why didn't you call the mechanic? -It was all so unexpected... ...and my husband had some calls. -I understand. It's hot today! If you'll permit me, I could offer you something cool to drink? Thanks, we'd love one. -One moment. Those two have vanished? -Same old story... The driver and his boss, happens all the time. Can I throw them? -Please do. Thanks. Thanks, we needed this. -Thanks again! You're welcome. -Is your captain young? Yes, but he's an expert. -As soon as you can, leave here. You're scaring me. -No, don't worry. What did this guy do? -Manslaughter, so they say... He was a smart guy, just about to graduate, who did something stupid. Are there any hotels or villas here? -No, you haven't reached them yet. We must leave, goodbye. -Goodbye. He's an interesting guy. Why? He's not an easy conquest... I like men who play hard to get, they push me. And Fabrizio? Fabrizio! He's different, he's too easy! We have the same passion. Passion for art? -No, a passion for success... By success I mean living, without fighting to make a living. Won't anyone help me? -No. Where's he going? -You saw him too. Who didn't? Even the police saw you, you weren't exactly discreet. Why hide? Because he was the escapee. -A man on the run never stands still... He's a poet, he's got a villa up there. Did you see it? -No, we stopped a lot sooner... He wasn't bad! -Did you know there are no homes here? I'm sure he's a poet! He had the eyes and voice of a poet. You seem nervous? -Yes, I don't know why exactly. There's someone on the boat. It's that guy, I want to meet him. -Don't go. I'll see what's happening. You know the boat won't start, don't go. I said don't go. Stop. Don't go. The girl's coming, nothing happened, No, that's not a woman! Sex doesn't exist anymore! This is the great conquest... ...apart from the moon. Man can die, drown or disappear... Women can live without them! You, her, all of us women... ...but not me! Where are you going? Where are you going? -I want to dive off those cliffs. It's dangerous. -You know I love danger. What was he doing on the boat? -He was just curious. What was he like? -Interesting. Handsome? He's handsome. Young? He's young. Would you like to make love to him? -I'd like to. Why didn't you? You could have? -He didn't ask me. What if he'd asked you? -Maybe. Is this an interrogation? Margerita has strange ideas about you. -I know. She says you aren't a woman. -Maybe she's right. What does that mean? -If I have to ask, I'll never be a woman. You had me worried there! I thought it may be hormonal issues... If you don't ask, you'll never know; a saying as old as the world around us. Unfortunately, the answer is there; Ask as much as you can and get it all. For you, but not for me. Do you have a boyfriend? -Just like everyone. Do you love him? I think so. Why haven't we been introduced? -Because you wouldn't like him. What does he do? -I've never asked him. How does he get by? -He survives. Would he marry you? -If he had money we'd live together... ...but you've got the money, including mine. What is it about me? Is it so hard for you to tell me? -No, it's very easy... I hate you... I hate you with all my strength. Is it Fabrizio? -No! What is that fool doing? -He's probably run off with that girl. Do you think he's so easy? -Easy as can be and available! I'm cold. What's wrong? -I'm not well. I'm cold. You swam too much. -No, it's another type of cold... I want to go away from here. Marco. Marco. This guy... shall we use him? That idiot's trying to impress us. I don't like it here anymore, I want to get away from here. Where? Far away. I saw something I've never seen before... I was scared he'd kill me... ...but now I know I could never look at my victim in the face. What are you saying? -There's a body behind the rocks... It's a policeman. -Don't joke! I'm not. The policeman on the radio! Don't go, he might be there. Who? I'm sure it was him. -I know what I'm doing. Wait, don't leave me alone. Hello. Hello. Say 'The sea'. 'The sea', then? -The sea! More. -'The sea'. Enough, I understand. Your voice is firm and cold, without crowding your emotions... She was like you, she was real. Do you know any more? Sure, I write a lot. -Where does it come from? Phrases, words, the sounds of a poet. Yes. Won't you say something about me? You are one of those... -I knew it! Idiot! You're one of those women who sees only one person; the beautiful beast! I don't understand a word but he's cute, right? Stroke me. You have the kind of skin renaissance painters used to depict angels. That fool still isn't back! It's better to drown our sorrows in a bottle of whiskey. Where did they go? I don't like being alone with you... You are more like an enemy, and less like a woman... I'm afraid of frigidity. Frigidity is a nymphomania. I'm not a nymphomaniac! -I didn't say you were. But people think it, and it upsets me. I enjoy feeling like a woman... ...and I like Marco. -No, leave him alone. You're not jealous are you? Don't be more stupid than you already are... I'm sure Marco will leave and I don't want to see you upset. So you don't hate me then? No, not now. I'm not in the mood. A day of great rebellions! Surprised? I also have a place, like you and Anna, maybe more than both of you... You're going to find out very soon! Who made that body disappear? -I saw it too... I saw it before you. -I don't believe you. He had a cut on his head. -Why didn't you say? I wanted us to stay calm until Fabrizio came back. That bastard's not coming back! Who knows where she is? What's she doing? I don't like this silence, where is she? She's looking for the body with Marco, she still thinks he's innocent. What can we do? -Nothing. All we can do is wait. I knew you'd come. Why do you swim in your clothes? If not, it would be too easy. -And you don't like easy things. Why do you cover yourself? -I'm scared of the sun. Sure, you don't know the dangers of a shadow... The long shadow of a church, or a cell. Where are you going? -To search... Margerita said she saw a dead body, and I believe her. What's there to see? Don't play games with me. What do you want from us? -What have I asked for? I'm coming to search with you, but it's funny... Us searching for a corpse? It's like kids on a treasure hunt! I don't understand. I'm saying, if it suddenly appears, we won't be so disturbed... It doesn't make sense; a dead man amongst all these dead rocks. What difference does one make when millions die all the time? I'd like to die here, will you kill me? Why do you want to die? -Because that's living. It's me who wants to... It's me who decides, always. I had a woman I believed in but I lost her. Can't you do something? Sure I can, but I don't want to. Will you kill me? You know where the body is? It's there! No, there! I don't know where it is... I don't know, because I didn't kill him! I had a woman once! What is he doing? Now, I don't have one anymore! Valeria! Take it, it's my good luck charm. -A gift? No, gifts are too definitive, I don't like that word. I'm going. Ciao, Valeria. -Ciao, Marco. Good luck. That bastard's not coming back and we're all in danger. Don't talk rubbish, Marco is here for fun, like us. Sure! He swam here and, in a minute, he's off to the continent. They'll get him. -The police? Right, but we won't be here to see it. -Stop it... If you're trying to scare me, I'm already in pieces. Did you know Valeria also saw the dead body? Nothing surprises me, Marco saw it too, he knows where it is now. Did you see it? -No. Thank god I have this advantage over you both. Am I seeing things? That's the police boat from before! Valeria! The megaphone! It's the police! Valeria hurry! The megaphone! Call them! I don't see the woman. -The captain is also missing. Youth! If I could turn back the clock, Not bad; three months of work and done. You call that work? Nice breasts! All natural. You wait here, I'll go and see. That weasel has a lot to explain! She must tell us why she didn't call the police? Why didn't she? You're here! Why didn't you call the police? -Someone took the batteries... None of the electrics work anymore. One of you has gone too far now... It's too simple. -I know. He's waiting for the right moment. -Who? Fabrizio? -Fabrizio has nothing to do with this... His complicity this: It's his damned habit of not missing an opportunity. Good for him. We can't stay like this... If something is going to happen... Let it happen! I'm going to find him, then we'll know. Pointless heroism. Let's wait a little longer... We could go back with the dinghy? -Yes... ...and spent the night at sea? We'll wait, he'll be back soon. -It'll be too late... Where's Marco. -I'm not telling you. It doesn't matter... I know where to find him. Don't go. Don't go. It's too risky, you fool. Marco. You're here. I'm here, what do you want? Why did you come? -I knew you were waiting for someone. Not just someone, I was waiting for you. You're beautiful. You're the most beautiful one! Let go of me, I want to know who you are? Someone who loves you. -I want to know who you are? I'm Marco. Why don't you kill us? It's not the right time. What are you waiting for? When the boat is ready, I'll kill you all. Tell me about yourself, tell me how you killed your woman? I didn't kill her, she was already dead for me. Don't move, listen... I've got to tell you something important; I have to kill you in the name of someone who hates you, someone you made suffer... Every woman has made someone suffer, perhaps a man, or another woman... For me it's like getting a clear order from those who've suffered. I have to kill you. I have to kill you. It could've been so much easier. There, sleep like that... Don't move, stay as you are. Don't wake up, agreed? You have such a beautiful name. Don't mess around. Have you finished with Margerita? Did you do it, or did you get scared? Margerita is... Valeria? She'll have her turn. Beautiful. Then... ...I wasn't mistaken. The first impression is always the right one... Your poems confused me. I read a lot in there to kill the boredom... Do you know who Fitzgerald was? He was a writer... A person I'd like to have been like. Did you know I was rich? Do you know what Fitzgerald would've said about you? You have an aristocratic nose, but you have a vulgar heart. How is your heart? -It's strange... Weak, sick a heart that's broken. -A lonely heart! We'll take you to the continent, 10,000 Lira, and protection up to Milan! I'm sorry but I can't accept, we'd never make it. I know it's difficult but I must kill you. I want to kill you... I can kill you, I must kill you. No, not in the dark, I'm scared! Sooner or later, everyone takes delivery of something important. Try to understand... Listen carefully. How did it go? Finally, you're back. It's been hell waiting for you, but it went to plan. Let's hurry. You take the controls. -The dinghy? Leave it here, it'll seem more credible. Marco, put the carburettor back in. What's the point? You know the tank is full. -I'll raise the anchor. Do something, help me! Finish him off, finish him off. Look straight ahead, don't turn around. -Why? Blood in the sea, it's terrible. It's our turn, now it gets hard. -I wouldn't go back to the port... Too many people saw you leave as four. We'll stick to the original plan, isn't that the golden rule? It's the police... We're being followed, was this also part of your plan? I planned for it. Slow down... No, go towards them. Something wrong? You should never have left us alone with that psychopath! Please explain? Margerita, Anna and Fabrizio... -Please calm down. We were here thirty minutes ago. -Please calm down. We tried to call you, then he arrived and tried to steal the boat! The others are still there. Do you need someone to help? -No, we can make it there ourselves. We're going to have a look, you two make yourselves available to the authorities. Of course... Of course. I don't get it. -I do... Did you hear? You've killed some other people... It's a shame we picked you up an hour ago, on the other side of the island... Otherwise I might well have believed him. Now what? Shall we let them go? -Let them go? Where can they go? I'm curious to know how this one ends... There's a lot of crazy people out there. They've gone, we've done it. We'll have to give a statement... There might be an interrogation, but we'll go straight to Milan, and there... There's a safe full of diamonds and a large cheque... I know where it is. We'll go to Lebanon... We'll start living then... A life I know how to live! No more tragedies, just love, dancing and games! Everything! You with me... My man, my invention. What if I don't want to escape with you? Why not? I wouldn't want to be your invention. -Then you aren't, you're just my man. If I wanted more than we agreed? A lot more, okay. And? If I felt I couldn't love you after all that's happened. You do love me, don't you? Of course I love you. What if... -What if? What if I'm not who you think I am? -I don't understand. If I'm not faithful, loyal... -Faith, loyalty? They're part of the game. What if I've already betrayed you? -I know you did, with Margerita. With Margerita and Fabrizio. -What about Fabrizio? Yes, above all, with Fabrizio. If I wasn't the cynic you thought I was... If I'd told Fabrizio about your plan, and he had offered me more... Why would you do that? -Just for fun... ...to see how far you'd have gone, before the others discovered who you are. What does this change? You've already killed Margerita. Did you see her dead? All that blood from Fabrizio? Did you see his blood in the sea? Tell me they were scared at least? -Yes, I thought they were going mad. It's a shame, I thought I'd finally found a good game. Interrabang, it rhymes with boomerang. What are you doing?
