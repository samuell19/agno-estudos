ERNST THELMAN THE LEADER OF HIS CLASS BERLIN Give me a "red flag" Here are the flowers... Will you buy flowers for your wife? -Easters. -Okay. -One token. -How much; A brand Please take it Thank you Where is Wiece Street? Turn left after Chapel Street You came early. For you You are being sent to Amsterdam for the anti-war conference Come in Our delegation leaves tomorrow Tomorrow; Fitz gets out of jail tomorrow. I heard you got married in prison It's been seven years Fitz -Always ahead -Red forehead Fitz Mine My love You came today, why so suddenly? I don't have anything ready and I didn't clean the house. I wanted to take your favorite lilacs and come to the station What will I do with you; Ah... Fitz Why did you come today? Tomorrow is 13 If you want, I can go back to jail. Haha... Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth Union Anne Jansen Ah, Fitz I forgot that I have to go to Amsterdam tomorrow Look, I'll go a day later, okay? The conference is only for two days I will stay with you forever. Where is our doorman? How is it; Do you want to see him; Of course He'll be my housekeeper when you're gone This is where Telman lives Dear friend After seven years in prison, you are finally back in our big family. I'd love to, but I can't shake your hand Dear comrade, because there is something important, I must go to the Ruhr today Revolutionary greetings, Telman The miners at the Mussel mine have not worked here for 7 weeks Actually! They have been on strike for seven weeks Tough and strong men. Kohler, can you go over there and see them? Have you forgotten, when do we get to the Ruhr? Yes, this is a problem I can't be everywhere To listen here, pull back your junk, quick. You can't go through here Ah... Mr. Lance Since when did you become a traffic warden? Better leave the wits behind, eh? We are on a mission Talk to your dad. He's in the back car. You go ahead Do you insist on nonsense? -Soldiers, -Lift the fuse You are the heroes, who want to take the bread of the poor This is for the striking workers You better not advise your husband to go to work to earn money to support your family, instead of helping him strike. I swore to God to be faithful to my husband. He is on strike and my heart goes out to him. Less nonsense. Take it easy. What are you doing; A...; Senator Telman Who made you do this? Go in the car to the strike committee, they will send two more people to help you. Go. It's hard to pull it off. This cow is going to be taken away from me. I have no money to pay my debts. So why are you helping the workers? We must help each other. When workers are fired, our own resources are also limited by the bosses . That's the point Under the heavy blow of a common destiny, the representatives of Industry and our Government, dear families of the victims, with immense sadness they bow their heads with you and Mourn. They send a final farewell to the victims of the last sacrifice in... -Hello. -Hello. Heroic victims now sleep in our land. I spoke on your behalf, on behalf of the Party Central Committee. You did very well, that's the right thing to do Your words are so touching Your words touched our hearts. On behalf of the Central Council of the National Trade Union, thank you. We care about the workers. So do we, Mr. Tel Nov. Someone was going from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell into the hands of robbers. The robbers took off his shirt, beat him and left him for a slow death. Our own William Mayer and some other brothers they had the same fate. They worked in this coal mine for 15 years. They fell into the hands of capitalist robbers and tortured to death. It is unacceptable See you tomorrow... What is this; According to my declaration, I accept to reduce my salary by 12% Good deal guys. I don't agree with that We don't agree If we didn't sign, we'd be fired Strike without signature. Like the miners of Lewis -You don't understand anything Does not matter Miners! Look, half the workers in the mine are getting fired. We are categorically opposed That's the deal. Take a look It's not like this. We must not accept it Let's go What happens; Comrade Telman is here Telman is here You have come at the right time, Comrade Telman! do you take a look at it? The capitalist wants to close the coal mine It's like our bones are being broken. Capitalists are very cruel. There is no food at home, we are hungry, with this note he threatens us again. What are we doing; How desperate are the capitalists She just buried her husband and now her son is going to be fired. Disaster after disaster Capitalism is our undoing Why there are so many accidents in the mine. Coal is precious and workers' lives are worth nothing. We must resist. Correctly... Strike Yes strike What you say is not so easy. If I lose my salary again, how will i live Can you live on this salary? Look this; Comrade Telman Denoff says, no strikes during economic crisis That is correct; This is his fear that the strike will deepen the economic crisis. It will weaken Capitalism But we hope so. Capitalism must be beaten constantly We do not protect the interests of the capitalists, but of the workers. Thousands are now unemployed shall we go on strike? Yes Whether the trade unionists can follow us is a big problem And at home? I'm afraid the women and children will starve. They will crush our legs. The Mines at Mansfield have been on strike for 7 weeks A woman said that once, I swore to be faithful to my husband. He is on strike and my heart goes out to him. Don't underestimate yourself Don't underestimate the power of worker solidarity One finger is easy to break, five fingers together is a fist The whole team. Comrades, unite. Get the bats ready Mr Mayor Hello. 22 police teams in the Essen area are waiting for your orders Thank you. Have you got my report? Severin Telman's activities are quite serious and the situation is not good. The government gave me special authority Telman's hopes will not materialize It's not Mansfield here. But miners in many countries support us With us the Soviet miners, French, British, Czechoslovakians, Belgians and Poles. And Poland supports us. Now everyone is on our side. Hallelujah, with us. Comrades, I agree. I'm not a good speaker. I won't say much. I just want to say this. I will not live like this, no way! We must strike. Correctly... Strike He is right We must demand that wages not be reduced. The dismissal decision must be withdrawn. If the government rejects our demands, all the mines must go on strike You didn't say a word. What is your opinion; Of course, our requests are reasonable. But if we want to start a general strike in the Ruhr, it won't be that easy. This is true. Does Comrade Florin understand this? The enemy does not sleep. It's okay, we'll turn the night into day. I think it's over. First we measure the leather and then we make the boots. What do you mean; Let's check our powers first. Then, we do a very careful preparation and start. Yes This is what we say in Poland, first measure the leather and then make the boots. The difference in wage growth in the Ruhr region affects the construction of warships There is no way you can decide anything without consulting us. I agree, Mr. Counsel! The skills of German Workers are world-renowned. First of all our workers are cheap. They are not expensive, but in the US steel companies are worried for the availability of grants in your factories. The new military budget can bring great prosperity to our factories. The new batch of warships, the new tanks, get a significant amount of government subsidies. This subsidy barely relieves the interest on our funds. I can honestly say we are very reluctant to give our dollars to incompetents. Unless there is a Strongman to rule Germany. Sorry. Let me remind you. What; The Session of the National Assembly begins. Mr Papen, in my opinion there should be military men in power. Our time is coming. Wait until the new presidential election is over. Mr. Attorney General, Telman is speaking to Congress. Let's go. Our response to the government is that, we Communists categorically reject this military budget. According to our party's program for national and social liberation, we believe that revolutionary militarism is a threat to our people. This is treason. National and social liberation can never be achieved by war. National and social liberation are linked to the overthrow of capitalism. We don't need the Bolshevik system. Correctly... Soviet workers proved that they can live well without capitalists. But the capitalists have never proved that they can live without workers. What a blow! Well done! Telman You, Thelman, want to disarm Germany. Exactly. You are wrong. We want to empower people, to take their destiny into their own hands. Like in the Soviet Union. We are fighting an unbroken struggle against capitalism, at home and abroad. We strongly condemn the Treaty of Versailles And the strict US plan. Tear down Versailles and beat the strict plan. Tear down Versailles and beat the strict plan. Who leads capitalism? Your Nationalist Party defends capitalism, he is the champion of capitalism, he supports the Treaty of Versailles and the strict plans. They want to see the communist MPs. Hello comrades. Hello! Florin. Hello. I heard you are ready. We're not late, are we? Did Telman speak? We are waiting for you. Please come in and talk. The capitalists in the United States, Britain and France are thinking wrong. They are thinking of rebuilding Germany. To take advantage of German imperialism to attack the Soviet Union. In fact, when Germany arms itself, it will attack them too. But after a long struggle, our working class has regained its strength. Here is proof that the working class is ready to fight. 300,000 workers in the Ruhr stopped working. 160,000 workers strike. Prepare to give them a big raise. This is an unprecedented violation of national law. Mediation to resolve labor disputes has not been completed The Union has not taken a position on this issue. It is against the law. Go ahead, Mr. Telman We recognize only one law. That of defending the interests of German workers. Quiet everyone, please. Keep order. The emergency law was signed by the president himself Correctly... But we do not agree with him. You made Hindenburg president of the republic, while it is nothing but a tool in the hands of the owners, the capitalists. Be careful what you say Mr. Telman. I can stop you talking. Hindenburg said without shame, how he has read no other book but the military regulations and the Bible. Hindenburg also said publicly that war was his medicine. Serious discussion of peaceful development in Germany, we can only do with the peasants and the workers. The Communist Party is the only one that can solve all of Germany's fundamental problems. We don't need to enslave people from other countries. Aggressive warfare is not required. All together for Thelman President. Vote for Hindenburg, it's Hitler's choice. A vote for Hindenburg is a war choice. Darius ' steel helmet team is ready. Long live the helmet team. Ask. March forward... Don't sit awkwardly. All civil servants have gone to the polling station. Only you are stubborn. Allow me not to lower the party flag in support of Hindenburg. I will not do it. He sees war as medicine. But my son gave his life. You talk about political issues. Don't get emotional. I know. But I will never be his standard-bearer. The election of Hindenburg is the election of Hitler. Electing Hitler will support the war. The election of Hindenburg is the election of Hitler Maybe you want to vote Telman. I would rather go with Sundenburg than the Communist Party. I'm not voting for Telman. But I'm not voting for Hindenburg either. You know you don't discipline if you don't fly the flag. This will be bad for you, the old Social Democrat. Don't be stubborn. I am not very happy with Hindenburg. But the trade union leadership of the big Berlin companies, he must not backstab him. You can do whatever you want, but for the benefit of the party we must act together. Vote for Telman, the representative of the proletariat. Telman will make a campaign speech. Vote Telman... Telman is a worker representative. Vote Telman. I know social democracy. Their goal was achieved. Hindenburg and Papen came to power, leaving the Commandos out The social democratic workers themselves are stuck in the mud. They want to move, but they can't without the approval of their leadership. We communists can not cooperate with them. They are confused and stupid. Have you been to the supervisory department? What is the mood of the employees? Have you spoken to union president Gilhagen? What did he decide? He is eccentric, he walked with their Flag next to the portrait of Hindenburg. Both look alike. I can't contain my nerves. How will a fight with them turn out? That's what they say... I was wrong. Together we set up the Party in Hamburg. We had successes and failures. Where are the successes due? In our party. Where should we attribute the causes of failures? To ourselves. Comrades, we must not compromise. It is not difficult for him to solve the problem. All Party members have embraced Severin Besides, the police are listening to him. Social Democrats. -What is this; -What; What are you doing; Take out the badge. - What are you talking about; - Take it off They are robbers. Do such things happen? Why don't you intervene? What could I do? I am also in the social democratic party. There are commands for this. This is a violation of human rights. Our lives are not insured It doesn't go any further. The workers are waiting for the Party and the Government to take some measures. Instead of sitting there watching the craziness of the reactionary forces.. day in and day out, Why are you not interested? It's not like that at all. Comrades, do not be swayed by Communist propaganda. Are we motivated? The policeman let them go... If you don't stop Papen's actions now, no one will be able to stop them. He is afraid to do this, and Hindenburg won't let him. What are you going to do; I still have the police with me, he obeys my orders. Is not that right; Colonel. Yes, my minister. Comrade Severin would do well to give weapons to the workers. Equipment of workers? This stage has passed. There is now a legitimate government to solve any problems. And the government is me, please excuse me, I'm busy now. What should I tell the workers? Mr. Minister, the President declared the country in a state of emergency. First he appointed Prime Minister Papen Prime Minister of Prussia. What; Second, executive power was transferred to Wing-General Lund Third, he has fired you. Severin!! He will be tried at the Supreme National Court. If you are able to do this. Show respect. Don't make me do it. What kind of action do you want me to take? How to explain all this? What; Will the military manage national affairs? That's bad. Not allowed here. No gatherings Dilute. Do not gather, gatherings are prohibited Go away, go away Get away. That's what I told Severin. He kicked us out. At first he resisted. But then he surrendered. I couldn't figure it out. A minister obediently surrendered to a lieutenant. Hell. A real shame. What are we going to do; We must move, comrades. I visited the Siemens factory just now. The workers there opposed Hitler and Papen, the two capitalists. Everyone wants to do this. But no one moves. Why; The leader of the Social Democratic Party rejected our proposal. Proposal, to jointly deal with the reactionary forces. These ridiculous... Brethren, let me repeat our proposition. We do not need conditions as a condition for our life together. We just have to fight against the reactionaries. Fight them to the end. Dear brothers, reach out your hand in unity. Correctly! Correctly! Are you honest Comrade Telman? You are very mysterious, you don't trust people. Why; If you have something in your heart, you must say it. You're right for what we are facing now. The Nazis will fill Germany with gallows. In this dangerous time, can't we be honest? Faced with the threat of war, with grave digging across Europe, can we be dishonest? Seeing so many dangers, we communists are fighting for the unity of the working class. Can we be dishonest? Read the newspaper Read the newspaper... Comrades, today we have a conference with special significance. So our members decided that the conference should be held in secret. Close the door. Dear comrades. He stands on this pedestal, the faithful friend of the French people. The Outstanding Son of the German People, our beloved comrade Telmann. He wants from this step to send to the honest French, the most urgent call to battle. Telman Telman... Long live Telman! Comrades. In Paris, the Commune of 1871 in the city where the revolutionary movement of the workers began , a conference is being held today, honoring the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the October Revolution. I want to blame the bourgeois governments of Germany and France. Get out! get out! Good evening to all. Hello sir What fair wind brings you here. hello hello There is an unwanted person, named Telman in the conference room. Welcome Telman!! Who told you he's not popular? See how welcome he is. I have orders here to deport him. Then I don't know if that person is in there. Because the Constitution doesn't give me the power to check everyone's documents. The Constitution; If you invoke the Constitution, you must first explain to us. Please be careful! I am a national official, I am doing my duty. Comrades. We German workers and peasants are not your enemies, but your natural allies. French workers are not enemies of German workers. But their class brothers, their comrades. Okay... However, since the German Imperialists are threatening France, and the danger of war increases, We must be more decisive, make the words of Carl Lee Berkey our motto. "The enemy is in our country" Capitalists struggle to strengthen their arsenal. But we Communists must emphasize to all people, that the weapons in the hands of the ruling class are turned against the workers. Fight the challenges of war in Germany and France. Eliminate war. Read the newspaper... Telman's word! ... Afternoon... Who wants the Berlin afternoon . The French police are looking everywhere for Telman. Afternoon... Hello. Hello. This is Comrade Telman. -Dear. Let's go. 14 years ago, at the end of the war, we're right up there on the hill. We were on this side of the hill. I would like to say that for all those who were killed, we must fight tirelessly. May a new war never happen again. We can live like brothers. The World War that began in 1914 for me and all veterans, it's not over yet. But the leader of the Communist Party Telman, suggests to get rid of the restrictions of Versailles, in a... peaceful way. He wants to deceive the German people. But Germany is better, not compared to other peoples. The French are particularly opposed to us. Such a chaotic situation is a shame for France. They and Bolshevik Russia, sooner or later, they will know the power of the Germans. Miners contribute about 1% of the total amount to the campaign fund. -How much can you secure? - About a million marks. Victory to our beloved leader! Ask! Win! Ask! I would like to make another prediction today. The future parliamentary elections will bring a brilliant victory of my ideas. They will go down in German history. Workers of Hamburg. We are not saying that Telman's election will bring jobs and bread. We say it's up to you. Now, this is the fate of the Germans. Regression or progress. War or peace. Hitler or Thelman. Vote Telman... Buy a newspaper buy a newspaper... The campaign has reached its climax. Only unity can empower the working class. Only struggle can make it a dominant force in the country. More than 800 strikes last week. Combating the growing threat of fascism, proves that the interests of the working class, they are completely compatible with our national interests. Comrade Hubble calls on Berliners to support the strikers. Gilhagen told me just now, how kicked out of the top union. Why was he fired? Because he chaired the strike committee. Many others have also been fired. I have been involved in the Union for more than 10 years. I was kicked out of the porters union Why; Because I am the chairman of the German Communist Party. Yes, I admit it! I am the President of the Party, of Livernese and Luxembourg. I recognize that I am against hunger and exploitation! I admit that I oppose war! Everything now depends on the unity of the working class, and the will to fight. Berlin workers. The Nazis suffered a major defeat in these elections. They lost over 2 million votes across the country. And our Communist Party won these elections. It became a stronger in many cities of the country. In Berlin we are the strongest of all Parties. Telman!... After a hard fight we won. This is a heavy blow to fascism. If our working class can unite, that would give them an even bigger blow. Our motto is "United! United, all together!" Even if these 2 million stupid pigs have betrayed me, I can't change my course. - I don't allow it. -Fuhrer, don't take it seriously. I can't stand this. Go to Babern at once. You have to make him understand that we are not going to finish him off. Führer, please listen to me. I cannot see Jews, and Bolshevik conspirators, ruining my success. I want to kill all these criminals. I will tie them to the gallows, hang them one by one. The workers would never recognize a Hitler coup, that's why the capitalists used the election to bring him to power. This is obvious. Gobern has publicly stated that once he has legally obtained power, then to abolish legality. The Nazis will use the harshest means to deal with every worker. You will never be asked whether you are a communist or a social democrat. Hublisi, you must go to the council of the Social Democrats. This afternoon I am drafting the Party's message for the New Year. This time to unite all workers, non-communist and religious. At this time, we must unite the entire vanguard. Matsenin is coming. I have information that the Turkish capitalists will meet Hitler again tonight. Telmann spoke again to workers in the Ruhr region yesterday. I didn't expect it to have so many followers. And not only the Communist Party. Do not fool yourself. If we don't find a solution now, there will be a worse accident than in 1933. What can we do; First Hitler must rise to power At first he will purge the Communist Party. Then we will get rid of the Social Democrats. And then he'll bust the unions. Hitler could be a good player. Blackmailing him is not simple We know his cards He is very impatient. His words can easily damage our relations with France. If you hesitate again, then our relationship with America can easily be broken. Please don't worry that I'm talking about socialism, see my action The world war. Bulwick, will start from Germany. What do you believe; Will he be elected in the next election? The Communists will get more votes if re-run.. Election season is over. Hello, Ann. Hello, Comrade Telman. How do you feel; Not long ago, ok, this is from 1933. Where is fitch? Don't worry Ann, he will return home tonight. Check out this book, it's very interesting. Thank you The Comrades are waiting for me, I must go. "What was the steel called" Okay, stop. I don't want to hear anything about joint action with the Communist Party. Even 10 proposals to be made We will say no 10 times! If the Party leadership continues to refuse, it would be extremely unfortunate. We are all against Hitler's government. What are you talking about; Now it's time to check the government. Go to hell. What do you say; Delnoff is right. See what Hitler can do when he takes office. Is he easy to drop? He will hang the pioneer workers on the gallows. The Party leadership does not say such things. You know nothing about current politics. I've heard enough. I'm going home. Gilhagen, come! don't be stubborn. Tonight is New Year's Eve. Gilhagen. Comrade Delnov, does the party leadership want to bring Hitler to power? What is it you ask? I want you to tell me, because you rejected Telman's proposal, thus paving the way for Hitler to power. Is this the policy of the party leadership? I have no obligation to answer you. I have been in the Social Democratic Party for 36 years. I always had the obligation to apologize to the party. From now on... I won't do it again. Gilhagen. This guy... He did the right thing. Hitler would never dare undermine the principles of democracy today. he wouldn't even think about it. Goal. Everything is over. What happened. Sit down. They followed Delnov like blind men. Blind people. It is done. What happened to Delnov? I cut off all contact with him. He wants Hitler in power. Hitler. Comrades in the party will be dragged into the abyss. It is done. Tell me what do you think. The leader of the Social Democratic Party does not accept that we are all against Hitler. But the Social Democratic workers are willing to work with us. So our current mission, is, to build a militant alliance with the Social Democratic Workers. The social democrats do not understand, that the Nazis won't feel sorry for them once they get power? The Nazis will push the German people to destruction. It's obvious to me. Here is the problem. Goodbye mate. What should we do, Comrade Pike? Everyone must fight from his position, for the solidarity of the working class... We are communists, Corey. Even if the format of the fight changes, we have to rely on the masses. Our Party is right and will surely win. If the Workers' Parties fail to be united, the Fascists will build an unimaginably bloody regime. The fight will be long and arduous. Good evening, Fitz Good Evening. I brought the envelope. Letter from Ubrissi. leader of the Underground party. Shall I take you to the Party Central Committee? Okay. I'm going to Kaseli. Do not go. Let Archie go. Go see Ann You shouldn't leave her alone. Comrade Corey, you haven't eaten, have you? Does not matter. You can eat first. Go. I sat too much. Thank you, Comrade Telman. Okay. Come on, let's go to my house. No, Ann is waiting for me. We go to the party office across the street. -Red forehead. -Red forehead. Fitz. are you back Don't move, sit down. You will become a mother. Sit down. How are the partners in Hamburg? See you later. Your new book? Telman gave it to me. This book is very good, I always wanted to buy it. look at this let me read it to you The most valuable thing in a man's life is his own life. We only live once and we should spend our lives like this that when we die, they can tell. His whole life and all his energies were devoted to the most wonderful cause in the world. In the fight for the liberation of humanity! I would like to write like this. this is how you should Live. -Yes You... Wait a minute our child, maybe become a writer. Maybe he's doing something extraordinary. There is such a possibility, the hidden talents of the parents to manifest themselves unexpectedly in their children. She will be a very active girl. Boy. Boys are.. boys. Why don't you just admit it's going to be a girl? Why don't you like boys? Do you like girls; Because I would call her Anna. Can a boy be called Anna? But also, when one has a child, his life has more meaning. The responsibility is even greater. For this child, for all humanity. Aid... Be careful, Gilhagen. Gilhagen. They killed him. Corey... Corey. It was a good new year. Gentlemen, For a Europe without Communist Parties. We Germans are God's messengers. To build a new world order, let's have a drink together. Hello, General. Thank you, Mr. Papen Hello, Mr. Prime Minister. With the national spirit alive, the desire of millions of ordinary Germans, he made me head of state. Win... Victory... Long Live! I deeply feel God's message. It helped me succeed. I'm glad to have you with me And you should be glad to have me as Führer. Victory... Long Live! We will not allow a general strike to occur. Never. Delnov of the Social Democratic Party declared the strike illegal. He issued a public warning. Let me introduce it. My plan, it's here and then here! Here is an underground tunnel, leading directly to the Capitol. What if we killed Hindenburg? I think this would stir up more opposition to the Communist Party. This old man of ours is still useful. This is a new method. I have seen her since the days of the Nile. You see, what the Communist Bolsheviks did. I must destroy communism, I must uproot it. Communist Party, United Front. I will never ally myself with those who set the fire. A friend of Thelman's stands there, a Communist Party official, Jansen Where is; Up there. Telman. What happened to him? They arrested him. Come on, Ann. Who was this guy you were talking about? Where was he talking to you a while ago? I do not know. Where did he go; There he went. Take him. That's him. Gilhagen. Come back. Do you refuse to talk? Think about it. But don't think too much about it. Do you want to go to the music room? Will you talk or not? Where is fitch? They bring Dimitrov. You set fire to the Reichstag. I see you act like you don't know. Who made me burn down the Reichstag? Be strong partners. Bastard! Tie him up. Come back. towards the wall. closer. pull closer! Today is a day of important events in the history of the national socialist movement. After the Reichstag was burned by the Bolshevik devils, Congress decided to meet at Crickley's house. The flag of the National Socialist Party flies in front of the conference hall. I want to sue Goeringk. As President of the National Assembly, I have the power to uphold the parliamentary constitution. They have a two-thirds majority. Why; The Communist Party was expelled. This reduced the seats by 81 and changed the ratio of votes. I won't vote for the Nazis anyway. Let's vote as one in this meeting. Nazi politics is a dirty scandal. Listen to me, didn't the Nazi party adopt many of our foreign policies? After our policy was adopted by the Nazis, should we object? Comrades, the problem is... We have to get out of here. We will not attend this meeting. You must not leave the party. Ok let's vote. Please let's take a seat now. Who supports Hitler, and the foreign policy proposed by the Papen government? Gentlemen, out of here please. What do you think about this place? Horrible. -What are these people doing here? They are some workers from Sar and two journalists. Please stop talking nonsense. I insist on meeting my husband. -I have that right. -What else do you want? I have the right to ask you this. This is my world. But there is more than you in this world. What does this mean; What I say. hi! Hitler! I would like to inform you that the National Councilor has arrived, with the delegation of Sar. Abroad there are absurd rumors about our new class. Let us now take a look at the life of the communist leader Telman. Mr. Telman, the gentlemen are from the Saar and want to speak to you. Gentlemen, please do not refer to political matters. Are you allowed to meet your family here? They don't even let my wife see me. Did you get my letter about our visit? No. Guys, we all knew you were coming. Not here already? So the letters... Have you received any indictment against you? No, I haven't. How will you be treated here? They treat me brutally. -No. -And not just me. Don't say that again. Please everyone get out. They are cruel to everyone. There was also a brutal massacre. Notify employees. -Truth; -Actually. Let the world know. Tell the world the truth about this. Hello. Don't procrastinate. The guardian is ours. Who do you think should take on this task? Who; But me of course. No, there are too many people in Berlin who know you. Find a guy with a burger. I can get Tillman out of the country. And after... Who are you thinking of? York! He participated in the October Uprising. This is the anti-key. Employees will never forget you. It is not easy to get this key. My commander only leaves it for a minute or two. Diggy? Does he represent Goering? Yes, he is Goeringk's special representative. Later... will you help us It won't be easy. Look at the situation. It is not bad. Okay. -Tomorrow. - we'll see you tomorrow. Hello. Have a cigarette. - Exactly one. - I don't know if it's for tonight. Diggy, they're playing cards in there. Great, I will keep the batch for a long time. exit gate 3. I'll take the police dog away. If something happens, I'll shoot twice. Ten minutes to get dressed. Ace. Look at them. Is this the key to Telman's cell? At the first opportunity, hang him. Strangeness. How can the guards open the door to Telman's cell? Alarm!! Discharge. Stop, don't run. Close all doors. Come on, York. Defendant Kerry York. Still refusing to tell us who else was involved in the escape? Don't you want to say who made this key? You said you made the key yourself? Bring the imprisoned Florin here. Stand up straight. I have been tortured 6 times. Your original occupation was a plumber. Once a member of the German parliament. You also served as secretary of the Hamburg German Communist Party. Are they like that? It's not wrong. Are you related to the accused? It's a great idea make us relatives. Can you answer that? Wasn't that enough? I am so glad you got my letter so soon. I will get to know the children. It is very painful for me to be separated from my child. You know my situation. We are family. Great ideas unite us. Go with your aunt. Mom will be back to pick you up in two days. Thank you Marda. Mama's good boy. -Hello. -Hello. Not bad at all. That's the way it should be. I just got back from Paris. I brought something. to celebrate Comrade Telman's 50th birthday. It's a letter from Roman Roland, Gorky and Jimmy Toroff Not here. Up there, no one will notice us. Okay. Take her. There is no place for this flag in Germany. We will keep her ahead. I'm going to Spain to fight fascism. Our two peoples could live very well, together as brothers. We must fight to the end. Only by persevering in the struggle can one live. Telman... This, also Telman.. Telman... These stupid mails. It's really annoying for all of us Another Telman. They consider prison ..a dance hall. Go get the record player. Okay! You've grown so much. I want to ask you a question. What is the problem; Miss Telman Did you get the letters? Ernst, we all celebrate your birthday. We wish you health. Thank you. All hail you, William Peck. The whole British Party. You really deserve sympathy. Why; You are a guard here, but you are like a prisoner. Something is wrong with your mind. Telman. Why are you so late? They made us wait for hours. I protest your behavior. On my birthday, don't keep the meeting time. What do you want; Telman. No one came to see you. Your 50th birthday is very good. Except for your wife and daughter, who came to see you. Everyone else forgot about you. What the hell; Give them the bag. Goodbye. Who told you to listen to this song? A 70-year-old greets you. You are the great symbol of the peaceful coexistence of the peoples of the world. Roman Roland One day people's hearts will turn into fire that will burn fascism. Rest assured, Gorky. Sphere. Left. At gunpoint, comrades. Comrades, Company Telman is here. The Telman company pays homage to the Paris Commune. Santa. Fitz. You are all here. Comrades, at gunpoint! Come on. Comrades, go ahead with Telman's ideas. Forward thinking to Telman. One day people's hearts will turn to fire, to burn fascism. Ask... Ask... This is a result of our war action in Spain. See, we pay particular attention to the strength of plains conflicts. Shame. This is embarrassing This is... Someone, clean the wall. Shoot them all Dear Führer, leave that to me. Don't call me Goering if Thelmann's influence doesn't subside. Here we are. We have a distinguished guest, act smart All guards standing, Goering. Present!! I am reporting on behalf of Dege everything is fine. Where is Telman? He is in this corridor completely isolated. All the cells around it are empty Hi Telman. I came to you personally, Telman I could have brought you to the Home Office. Or the Air Force. Or the secret police. But I always wanted you to make a move on me. I always respect you, Telman. Your beliefs are hostile to mine. But your fortitude makes me respect you. Telman is a tough guy. Not at all. Göring softened him up considerably. Now we are building the new European order. Can you lend a hand? I can give you complete freedom, Telman. There are no conditions. We are not asking you to join our party. As much as you can... Don't treat my good intentions like that. I'm telling you, Telman. I will never shoot you. I will never hang you. I will never let my dog ​​kill you. It hurts you so much to be a boss. I'll let you stay in a cell for a few decades. You will rot like a corpse. And we will rule all of Europe. Poland has the cheapest human resources. Norway offers Northbound coverage Denmark and the Netherlands are suppliers of meat and vegetable oils. Belgium has coal and iron ore. France has coal, minerals and fine wine. In North Africa our target is the Suez Canal. The Balkans are a cover to the South. The black sea has oil. Donbas has coal mines. Ukraine food. In a few days our troops will enter Moscow. No one can stop us. Until then everything will be German. This is an unexpected vision. But war ... Which is rather long. A lot of people would like that. Mr. McFrier, you don't seem to believe it. I think we Germans are lucky. I like my luck better. My son in Poland in Golis manages the Oriental factory Where we have good production conditions and labor from the concentration camps. Mr. Councilor. -What Something is wrong Equipment No. 3 of the third Eastern project was ready to be loaded into the car, but when it was checked, it was all about rubbish For the trash? 5% less than standard. They had changed the plan. We caught a Frenchman who was indifferent. Take a look. Come with me. Hell. There is no way. 60% of our employees are foreigners. This is also an unexpected vision. Arrested for inaction. I know you. You were in Farr's delegation. Do you know Telman? You do not even know me. Do you know what the crime of inaction does? Take him. Long live the world struggle of the peoples against fascism. Long live Ernst Thelmann. In the past, we were a nation with no margin for survival. For a long time ... You can't swallow this easily We must conquer the world. Yes, that would be great That's wonderful. Drink up. Good drink! Attention attention! we will now read a message from the Führer.

Why don't you wait in line? Sorry. Are you Mr. Thomas? Slower... He no longer works here. -ok -Ann Jansen Follow me. In many battles the Guards of the 143rd tank division were incredibly heroic.
