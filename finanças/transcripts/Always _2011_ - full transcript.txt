You came running here again? In the rain? Yes. Even the gods are jealous of the good times. What do you think this means? Take a look at your fortune for today. You are a sheep, right? (Note: He was born in the year of sheep) I thought you quit the job. Take it slow. Stay clear of any trouble. - Please go home safely. - Goodbye. Take care of yourself. It didn't start yet, right? These are red bean jellies. These are tangerines. And this... is mine. And this is your favorite. Ugly gimbap. (Gimbap - rice and different foods wrapped in seaweed) And to accompany that, I also brought baekseju for you. (Baekseju - rice wine) Is it too overwhelming? Who are you? Who are you? Where did the grandpa go? He stopped working here today. Then why did you receive all of those? You gave it to me. I come here frequently to watch dramas with grandpa, have some midnight snacks and whatnot. Grandpa isn't feeling sick, is he? He said he needed to move to the countryside. Oh, is that so? Please excuse me. Excuse me... You can watch whatever you want and then go. Since it's raining a lot too. That's the channel. =Gray? I don't want you to wear gray.= =The color I hate the most is gray.= =Do you know why?= =Because I am gray.= =Me too!= =Me too!= =I want to become a primary color. A primary color.= =Anyway, not this one.= =Drift to the lowest place in the Republic of Korea, right?= =Stop joking around.= It was nice watching the drama. They may look ugly but the taste isn't bad. Want to try some? They look too ugly, don't they? Ah, right... That tuberose needs to be watered once a week. You can't let it die. =Hello.= Excuse me. I want to find someone. I'll be back soon. Hello, this is the information desk. Yes, customer. Then I'll just transfer you to the nearest service center. 15 000 Won in basic usage fees were made and the transaction fees from the money transfer... =Damn it, how come you only know how to talk about money?= Customer, I'm very sorry for causing you to feel inconvenienced. I think the reception of your problem was delayed. I will immediately look for an emergency replacement. Is it all right if I make a booking for 5pm today? =Just try not showing up again!= =Do you know how many times I've called?= Once again, I apologize. I don't know how I can help... Sir? Why are you getting angry at me? Am I your child? You should always maintain a touch of compassion, okay? Then the whole world can be filled with love. You must be very tired because it's a night shift, right? I actually feel better because I can take naps now. Okay then. Please work hard. You do know that you're in the running for outstanding employee, right? Yes. One, two! One, two, three! Relax your shoulders! Take note of the angle! Use your waist! I told you, use your waist! When are you going to make some progress, brat? Damn! I'm even better than you! Director. Take a look at who's standing in front of us! I came to apologize, Director. I'm sorry. Here, drink a bottle of this. After that, just forgive him. That's enough, Director. It's already in the past and you're still being so petty. In the past? When I picked up a pathetic child and fed him rice as I tried to turn him into a champion. I only fed my children ramyeon! Did you know? A punk without a conscience... He fed his children ramyeon because they liked eating it. Hey, come take a look here! Take a look at who this is! He's Jang Cheol Min. The 1999 MMA national champion. (MMA - mixed martial arts) Didn't even need several punches. In the first round, he used his gaze to defeat his opponent. The second round, only 3 punches. The third round, 5 punches. - In the finals... - In the finals, the person he defeated... Was me, Min Tae Sik. It's been a while. Ah... that's right! But, Cheol Min, let me tell you right now he is not the Min Tae Sik that you knocked out in one punch. You've seen him on TV, right? In the world of fighting, people are very optimistic about him right now. Right now, he is a rising star. I've seen you in competition. Not bad at all. What? "Not bad at all"? Since you've come, why don't we have a warm-up? You're going to go out in the UFC in a little bit, why are you acting like this? Cheol Min has been resting for a long time. He just works now. He's already overwhelmed. If he gets hurt, are you going to take responsibility? I'll be going, then. Wrap him up with bandages first. Just spar one round. I'm sorry. He's not even a boxer. Why was he allowed in? Hurry up and make him leave! Could we open the window for a moment? My nose is more sensitive than others so... Did you exercise today? What kind of clothes are being worn right now? I'm just wearing a cotton t-shirt. I'm not talking about you, ajussi. (Ajussi - older man, uncle) I'm talking about Eun Su, the heroine. A skirt. What about the shoes? Wearing them. Of course, she's wearing shoes! I mean, what kind of shoes? High heels. Are you sure that she's not wearing flats? What about her hair? Short, permed hair. Is she wearing earrings? Let me ask you... Do you always talk this much when watching a drama? It's because I can't see. What kind of earrings is she wearing? She's wearing earrings similar to yours. Seriously? Really? Excuse me... Your lunch box. How did it taste? The appearance was very ugly, but the taste was good. They're peaches. Are they washed? Yes. Did you do it with care? What? Peaches need to be cleaned carefully and eaten immediately, Peaches are very tender. They'll get bruises, and won't taste as good. Thank you, I'll eat them well. And my name isn't "You There", it's Jeong Hwa. We usually greet people by shaking hands. Wow, it's so rough. What kind of work would make it like that? Thank you for watching dramas with me. You bought new shoes, right? It smells like new shoes. I bought them several days ago. The drama seems to be starting. I'm going to the bathroom first. I'm sorry. =Don't go.= =I'm not fine. I'm not fine at all.= - =Right now, I...= - Don't go. =You have to know how much I don't want to leave right now.= What? Tae Ho said he has to leave. By any chance, is he crying right now? Yes. When he's hurting so much in his heart, why does he insist on leaving? We can hear people's hearts. Since we can't see, we can feel it more clearly. Handsome? He's probably an actor because he's handsome. No, I was talking about you, ajussi. Other people... have said that I'm very masculine. In other words, you're not a pretty boy. Don't move! You'll get hurt. Are you okay? Aigoo! They're all broken! (Aigoo - oh dear, oh my god) What am I going to do? I was looking after it for somebody. I will pay for everything. I'm sorry. Aigoo... For a girl who can't even see. Where exactly were you going in the middle of the night? I'm sorry. Aigoo... Ajussi, it looks like I will have to take her to the hospital. Could you please cover my shift at the parking lot for me? All right then. I'll watch the gate. You go quickly. Ajussi, what's your name? Marecelino. Pardon? Jang Marecelino. Ajussi, you're a foreigner? No. I'm Korean. But your name is Jang... Jang Marecelino? Yes. Jang Marecelino? Yes. Wait a second. Let's rest for a while. Want me to carry you? You'll regret it. It's okay. Get on. You'll really regret it. If you do something weird, you know, right? Hey... We're at a three-way intersection. There's a beauty salon on the right. Ah... beauty salon. On the right, just go all the way up and we'll arrive. I told you, you'll regret it, right? Are you tired? I'm fine. I'm fine. Then how come I keep slipping down? And also, there's a little kid there, right? You might need to be a bit careful. What are you doing? - Ajussi! - What are you doing? - Ajussi, kancho! - Ajussi, run! Run! You want me to run? It was tiring, wasn't it? Yet, how can a big man not even have any strength? It's not like that. I need to catch my breath before continuing. The stairs were just so long... Ah, I'm sorry... But if you have time... could you do me another favor? What? Wait... let me catch my breath first. It was clogged, right? It appears to be panties. Could it be the one with the squirrel... Squirrel? Please give it to me. It was a gift. So, it was here. I didn't even know, and I've been looking for it everyday. The towel... Excuse me. Ajussi, what kind of music do you like to listen to? The ones on the radio... that's the music I like. This is a reward. Today, you carried me and helped me. Attend with a friend, they're concert tickets. Give it to someone else. I don't really know music that well. Moreover, there's nobody to go with me. How can you not have a friend? Would you like to go together? Wow. Eonni, your hair has grown so quickly. What hairstyle do you want to do today? Let's do it like this. How about we do what was recently popular. Straighten your hair, or do a digital perm. How is that? Your face is oval-shaped and your chin is very nice. I feel that will surely be very suitable for you. Seriously? Then... Choe Gang Hui's hairstyle... (Choe Gang Hui - a South Korean actress) No, we can't do that! What age is it already and you still want that kind of tasteless hairstyle? Then, please do you as you see fit. You have a date, don't you? - No... - I got it, I got it. Well then, I'll start the digital perm. Pink. This... You didn't wait too long, right? ~ Flowers are blooming, ~ ~ even in my heart. ~ ~ You are a fragrant spring. ~ ~ Flower petals... ~ ~ are leading me. ~ ~ Making me fall into your embrace. ~ ~ It's you... ~ ~ the person I've been waiting for. ~ ~ I guess I was lonely... ~ ~ by myself. ~ What does the female singer look like? She has big eyes. On her right cheek, she has a mole. She has long hair. Ah! A sudden feeling of cheerfulness! It's really been a long time since I've seen a performance. Did you recently do your hair? Why? Is it strange? No. Aren't you hungry? Actually, there's a place that I've always wanted to go to. There's a family restaurant that I used to go to frequently with my past lover. I wonder if it's still around? Ah... delicious. Do you know of the "Thinker"? Rodin's work called the Thinker. About him... His toenails are especially short. His toenails were cut especially short. I also learned to carve when I was studying. However, there are some things I don't remember too clearly. Things you would see everyday... Just like what flowers grow in front of the house, or whether the mole under my eye is on the left side, or on the right side. And my father... The man that I mentioned before, he was my father. If I had known earlier, I really should've looked more closely several times. Because if I remember more, I would've been able to see those things now. I know you guard the gate at the parking lot. What do you do the rest of the time? After getting up in the morning, I go and deliver water. Then what about when you were young? Could it be... you did a lot of bad things, you just lived without caring. Were you that kind of person? Are you usually this interested in other people's lives? I just might misunderstand that I've been ignored by you. Why is it that you can't be honest? How I feel right now... do you know? I don't understand those things. And I don't care about those things. But I do know what you ate today. That's right. I announce to everybody what I ate each day. I'm going to the washroom for a moment. I troubled you a lot today. Please go. Also... I made you spend too much effort today. I'm sorry. I... I'm thirty years old, and a former boxer. When I was young, I lived an extremely bad life. Extremely bad... Right now... I don't live like that anymore. Me, that's the kind of person I am. You... Miss Jeong Hwa... It's not because of you. It's because I'm not worthy. I was unable to say it. I'm going in. Yes, thank you. I'm operator Ha Jeong Hwa. Please have a good day. Yes? Ms. Jeong Hwa, can you please come to my office for a moment? Please sit down. This is a gift for you. What kind of gift? Why didn't you tell me? I heard your birthday was last week. It's all right. Thank you. Thank you for what? Let's have dinner together next week. Well then, I'll go out first. I just want to kick away this awkward silence. Hey, Cheol Min. The director came and sought you out himself. If there isn't anything major, come back to the gym. Let's start over. I'm sorry. Let me just ask you one thing. Where have you been all this time? Hey, Cheol Min... Although I'm not too clear about you, I'm very clear about your ability. With regards to boxing, it's already past its prime. People don't watch empty-handed fights. Some 300 odd days in a year like this each day. People have already seen enough. Let's do MMA. MMA. Are you going to keep your amazing fists hidden forever? Aren't you the least bit guilty towards your fists? I understand. If you have nothing to say, I'm leaving. Director... I... was in prison. What? For 4 years and 3 months. After giving up on boxing, my job was to beat people up. I was a debt collector for loan sharks. With my own two hands. Us... My family... My wife ran away. Parents of bastards like you, gave birth to you, and sang you lullabies. Jerk. This is... all that I have, you bastard. I... I've never listened to lullabies before. I... I'm an orphan! Please open the door! Who is it? Brother Marecelino. I already told you. You look the most handsome when you smile. Just like that! Perfect! Maintain that expression now. Sister? Is it impossible to change my baptized name if I've already received one? What are you talking about? It seems like the name of a movie actor. Jang Marecelino. I was so happy after I heard that it'll be your baptized name. The disabled people of our monastery made this. Do you even have a girlfriend to give it to? Who is it? Miss Jeong Hwa, so this is where you lived. Team Leader Ma? You've rejected me every single time I've asked you to go on a date. Why did you lie? You don't even have any plans today. Give me a cup of tea. It's hard for me to use the fire. So I don't have hot tea. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't think of that. It must be scary for you to live alone here. You said that you got hurt when you were in college, right? Your eyes. It's too bad. You were probably very popular back then. I'm sorry, but please go now. Does your wife know you go around like this? The gift. You didn't even open it. You probably don't know that well because your still a miss. I got divorced not long ago. Because I beat my wife. I knew it would be like this. It matches you so well! Miss Jeong Hwa. You don't know how pretty you are, do you? Do you think that I would seduce one miss like you, so I can sleep with you? With just a little bit of money, there are so many prettier women than you. I can get them if I want to! Do you really want me to become a rapist? Huh, do you? - Do you want that? - Please, don't do this. Who is it? Don't do this! I'm... I'm... I'm Miss Jeong Hwa's superior at work. I just came over for a cup of tea. Stop it, ajussi! Look straight into my eyes. Next time, I'm going to kill you. Miss Jeong Hwa. Are you okay? Why did you do that? If I get fired, are you going to take responsibility for it? Why do you want to continue to go to a company like that? After going through this, why do you bear it? Because I need to live. Because I need to live. I'll be liable for you. I'll be liable, would that be fine? Are you going to find me a new place to work? Or... Are you going to come beat up people every time something like this happens? Ajussi, who are you, to take responsibility for me? I will help you. I will. Right now. Do you know that you're making me feel more miserable? Do you know that? Please leave. When did you come? Just now. I turned in my resignation. I... it's because my heart feels so stuffy. If you have time next weekend, can you take me somewhere? Why aren't you answering? You told me you'd be liable for me not that long ago. You can at least do something simple like that, right? Yes. I will. This. What is it? Don't be alone everyday. At least stay with him. When it grows up, it becomes a guide dog. A golden retriever? Oh my gosh! What should I call it? How's Ding Ga? Ding Ga? Ding Ga, Ding Ga, eat well, live well. Well then. Jang Ding Ga? Ding Ga! Ding Ga! I grew up at an orphanage near here. I came here with the other children. We caught fish, and we even swam. Because of a flood, it was completely submerged. A place to come back to. The only place that I can remember. This was the only place. Ajussi, please find me a stone. This stone. It feels just like you, doesn't it? I'm going to think that this stone is you and will always take it around with me. Therefore, ajussi, think of this stone as me and take it around with you. For somebody who says he didn't want to, then comes back here with his own two feet, there must be a reason why. Director, really... He says he wants to earn money. You've made a good decision. Let's go to the UFC. America! Ding Ga, do you want to read too? Here. Harder! Let's take a rest! Rest! On the right side, the dining table. Did you trim the edges too? I changed the location of some of the furniture. The door threshold is gone. Behind you is the bed. I replaced the windows. Because the sun comes in so well. What? I just want to see. If I do this... It feels like I can see you. Are you looking in my eyes? Yeah. Liar. That's right! That must have hurt! I don't dance well. I think so too. Before, I loved when it rained. Now, I don't. It's scary now. Why? Just because. Turn over. - Why? - Hurry, just turn over. What are you going to do? Use the thumb to press the muscles around the cervical vertebra. Does it hurt? No. It's refreshing. The words on this notebook. What does it say? Why? Do you want to learn braille? No, I was just asking. It's an excerpt from Romeo and Juliet. "Her eye discourses," "I will answer it." But why are you learning how to massage? Just because. It's always good to know how to do things. And also, I'm able to relieve your tiredness. But you know what happens if you come back injured after boxing, right? You've been coming back recently with your face all swollen. I'm just doing it as a hobby. Let's save up some money. So we can open up a little workshop. We can make bowls, and also some vases. I'll do the deliveries. Cheol Min! Believe in yourself! Go, go, go! Don't be pushed, go! Give up? Stop! You did well. You did well. Good job. Amazing! Thank you! Fighting! Usually, it's 900 thousand Won. But they said they'll give you another 100 thousand Won. And you even received tip today. Hey, Dog Cheol Min hasn't died yet! Cheol Min. Don't do shows at places like this. Next time, why don't you have a fight with me? Let's fight formally. Hyeong. (Hyeong - older brother) Why don't you say hello? Do we have the same mom? Or the same uncle or aunt? I don't share one ounce of blood with you, so why am I your hyeong? That's why... If you had just followed me, you wouldn't be stuck here like this. Aigoo! I'll see you at the ring soon. That bastard only thinks about himself. When we had finally made him a somebody, he just left with all the money. I saw him riding a Benz recently. And not that long ago, he was worrying about his rent. Hyeong. Can you cut this? It'll probably be fine soon even if you leave it alone. I'll get in trouble. You just might die from love. Just might die from love. Just love, but don't die. Here. Wait a moment. Why are you like this all of a sudden? It's not even your first time. Does it hurt? That's why... Never have a lover lonely male knife France inside is have feelings. Although painful also good extremely important. Blood always remain a incessant. Is it better? Aigoo. I'm back! Did you do well in the competition? Let me do an inspection. Not too swollen. But where are you going? Isn't Children's Day tomorrow? I have to go out with you, so I tried on some clothes. Say hello, ajussi. They're my mom, and dad. Hello. Please look after me. Dad, what do you think? He's dignified, right? Didn't you say that if I got a boyfriend, I had to bring him here for you to see? Pardon? His stature is tall, but you're not satisfied with his appearance, Mom? This ajussi... the first time I met him, his voice was really warm. I just thought he was a good person. It was Children's Day. That day, we went to a family vacation. I was drowsy. Even though it was raining, I wanted to give Mom and Dad a graduation present. I'm... an orphan! Please open the door! Who is it? Who is it? It's the police. Someone called the police. Open the door quickly. Quickly open the door. Ajussi... What are you doing? You just live well. Dad, Mom, does it hurt? If it doesn't hurt, then that's good. But... It feels like my dad and mom are still protecting me. That's why I met a good person like you. Jeong Hwa... Ajussi? Please sit down. It's corneal damage causing visual impairment. She'll lose her vision completely if it continues like this for another month. Besides waiting for a donor, is there no other method? A method... well, there is.... Hey... Why did you contact me? Lend me some money. How much? 30 million Won. When do you need it? Urgently. Life is so interesting. With just the blink of an eye the roles have switched. Before I still you little brother. There's still a way. It's really urgent, right? - One moment. - Let's go. Hold on tightly. Are you all right? How did it go? You're just bringing me to such a fun place now! Again, again! Do the operation. What? The doctor said... they can buy corneas from the United States. You knew all along, right? Why didn't you tell me? Where would we get so much money? Don't worry. I have savings. I'm fine the way I am right now. Having you by my side, I'm already happy enough. If you don't do it now, you won't have the opportunity later. I... whenever I recall that day, I just feel that I had caused dad and mom's deaths. Copy should be according to them and go. My heart really aches. Being unable to see makes it rather easier on me. Don't you want to see me? We still need to have a child in the future. Our child... Don't you want to see our child? Are you married? No, I'm not. A lover? I have one. In case there's an accident, it will be dangerous. Are you sure it's all right? I can handle it. First, this is an advance payment. Temporary cell phone. Actually, this case is not too different from regular competitions. But, in case we're discovered by the Thai government, it will be very troublesome. This matter is done on your own accord, Jang Cheol Min. You will be solely responsible. Understand? Why don't you answer? I understand. Ding Ga. You understand, right? You need to protect her well. If they find your close relatives or lover, they might get hurt. It's best to make preparations. You understand what I'm saying, right? Are you insane, rascal? I told you not to be with Tae Sik, didn't I? Where exactly are you going? I'll be back soon. You've suffered so much. It wasn't easy competing formally. You... It's for that girl's eyes, right? In case something happens to me, I'll put the money into this account. You must give the money to her, you understand, right? If something really happens, what should we do? You only live once. I have no regrets in life. Ajussi, you were right. What? I want to be with you, and see the sunset. See how beautiful Ding Ga is. Also, I want to see how beautifully you renovated our house. And I want to see Dae Gang. Also... What else? Lie in bed, constantly looking at your face, for roughly 23 hours. I'll look at my face for 1 hour. But... in case you're contrary to what I had imagined, and you're ugly, what should I do? Compared to what you imagine, I'm much uglier. You should prepare your mind. You might not even be able to recognize me. That's absolutely impossible. I'm so nervous. See you later. See you later. You won't leave, right? You'll wait here for me, right? Where would I go? There's nowhere I could go. I'll be back soon. Remember your new identity. You're name is not bad, Gim Hak Seon. It took a bit of time to make you a "three-have-nots" identity. No misdemeanors. No arrests. No criminal records. Hey, the invincible Jang Cheol Min is actually nervous. Don't be frightened by your opponent. Don't think about how to defeat him. Think about how to go back alive. The rule here is that there are no rules. Fight until one party is knocked out, or dead. If you want to live, then stay alert. Cheol Min. Guess who I bet to win? Fight well. Don't be a disgrace. Just in case... Jang Cheol Min wins, that's not a small sum of money. I will turn these into diamonds for you. If you help me transport these back, I'll just treat it as postage. I'll pay you an additional 20 million. About Miss Ha Jeong Hwa, I would like to know the results of her operation. Thank you. Thank you. =Hello?= I arrived safely. =Are you at the shore?= Yes. =As a precaution,= =we'll contact you again after you arrive at Incheon station.= I understand. All right, that's good. Excuse me... Is there still no news? What's your relationship? Are you his wife? No. Are you his sister then? Firstly, to report a missing person, not only do you not know his ID number, you're also not his legal kin. There's a whole pile of such missing people. If it's only a love affair, please just go home and wait. This Miss no matter how you say all compared to to agree to use? The project has already been halted. What can we do if you keep acting like this? Because of you, our project is unable to proceed. I say, if you won't move this week, I don't have a solution either. Oh, you're moving. I nearly wasn't able to deliver this to you. It's Jang Cheol Min, right? She is Marecelino's girlfriend. Nice to meet you. I'm Ha Jeong Hwa. Please sit down. That's a relief. You can see now. Cheol Min... he said a lot of things about you. He said you're very beautiful. That... day of the accident... May 5th. That day, you had the accident. It's the same day that you had the car accident. That day, it was raining. -=Two years later=- This design... how should I say it? Should I say that it's very warm? The sense of color is also very high-class. In here, mark the size, the solubility, and the weight. Based on this standard, can you make 52 pieces? Of course! Thank you. I will do a good job. You're unmarried, right? I'm married. Why do all the beautiful and capable women already have owners? Please fulfill my request. Also please you. Yes, Director? Of course, I'll go. Yes, see you this weekend. Yes. Hello, Director. Like this insist do public welfare activity. Is really great. No... If it was someone else, they would've run away already. Hello. Grandpa! Have you been well these past 2 days? It's been bad! This hurts and this hurts. I'll put this here. I planted this myself. I thought you were just good at massaging. You have such dexterity. Your body is a lot softer. You appear to have been working hard in doing exercises. Hello. You're new here, right? He was transferred from Incheon Hospital not long ago. Are you unable to talk? He can hear what people say. Since he arrived, he hasn't spoken a single word. I'll help give you a massage. What should we do? Your muscles seem to have atrophied a lot. Now, let's turn your body over. You must get well. Be strong. Let's go. I'll temporarily leave him here at your place. Why... what is wrong? It seems like he's sick. I plan to take him to the vet later. I'll buy some water when I come back. Ah yes, okay. It's newly delivered. It's called tuberose. When it blooms, it's extremely beautiful. Shall I give you that? Ding Ga! Ding Ga! Are you all right? Come here, come here. Are you all right? Can you stand up? I'm sorry. He wasn't like this originally. Are you all right? You're not hurt, are you? You... Could it be... Are you the one that I gave a massage to? Ding Ga! Ding Ga, seriously, what's wrong? If you continue like this, you're going to be punished. I forgot to bring my wallet. Where are you going? I'll take you there. The tortoise there... where did it go? Didn't you just put it there? Miss Jeong Hwa, what's wrong? By any chance... Did a lame guy just come by? Yes. He bought the tuberose that was over there. The one in the innermost room on the second floor. The man with a scar on his face. =Although the name of that person is not the same as what you said,= =he left the hospital a few days ago.= Ajussi. Didn't I tell you before? Opening my eyes, I only wanted to see your face. But why... did you only let me see myself? I'm sorry. I'm really very sorry. Look at me. Look into my eyes. Ajussi, I miss you a lot. Jeong Hwa. I love you. You guys are on the same side, aren't you? If you don't want to die, bring me the money. -=Name: Gim Hak Seon=-
