It's night. Everyone, close your eyes. Mafia... open your eyes. Mafia... kill someone. Mafia... close your eyes. Doctor... open your eyes. Doctor... save someone. Doctor... close your eyes. It's morning. Wake up. Last night, the Mafia killed someone. The Doctor didn't guess correctly. And who was killed... Sara. Oh come on, Doctors. Let's take a vote. Who says, Babak? Look at her. She's delighted. Okay. Who thinks it's, Mohsen? You're making a mistake. Raise your hand. You'll see. Who thinks it's, Farhad? Who thinks it's, Neda? Come on. Neda, defend yourself. You're making a mistake. One of you guys is a citizen. You're making me out to be the Mafia. You're letting them win. Anyone buy that? Thank you very much. Sorry Neda. You've been condemned to death. Your last words. My last words? Babak, look after our baby. I lost the game. It's just a game, sweetheart. Don't worry about Shabnam. I'll find her a sweet mommy. My ghost will find you and pluck your eyes out. You're giving me goosebumps. Not funny. The Mafia is the winner. Neda and Sara were both citizens. See, I told you. But you two are so good at lying. It's hard to believe a word you say. Who was it then? Obviously it was, Babak. Babak and Mohsen. I told Farhad but he's too stubborn. Come on. Let's get some shots. Forget this. Where did you put it? It's in the freezer. Neda, check on Shabnam. Make sure she's not up. She's asleep. The monitor is in my pocket. I guess I'll get the barbecue ready. I know this brand. It doesn't sit well. You'll be fine, give it up. Makes me throw up. Where are your glasses? Ladies. Who's up for a shot? I'm breastfeeding. It's good for you. It'll keep the baby asleep all night. - He's crazy. - Want one? I'll take one. Anyone else? You know Mohsen and I don't drink. You guys are party poopers. So it's you, me and a little for Sara. Don't go overboard and get drunk. Don't be like that. Just a couple shots for my toothache. I'm serious. I don't want to deal with it. Just take it easy. We need someone to take care of you. Where are the kids sleeping? They're in the room with Shabnam. Guys. Come on out. What are you doing? Come on, she's awake. Don't wake her up. Let her sleep. Is she awake? Sweetheart. My pretty girl. Sleep. Sleep my love. What is it? What happened? Why are you looking at me like that? Sleep. Sleep, sweetheart. Maryam. Open your eyes. Look at me, call me. It's daytime. The sun is out... We have to learn this before we can teach you. You'll have to learn it. We have to learn it. Do these. You're welcome. Like this? No. Put it through the middle. You've never done this before? Like this. Yes, that's better. I'm learning a little bit. Well done. You know last week for the first time I made gourmet subzi and Farhad was very impressed. Bravo. Very nice. Thanks. Have you guys decided on a second baby? One is enough. When Barbod grows a little I'll have my second. That's a handful. An only child becomes spoiled. I don't want him to be alone. It's not fair. I wouldn't mind another one, but it's really hard. Just one has been a struggle. Shabnam's a good baby. What would you do if you had a boy? Shabnam is a quiet child. We're the ones who are on edge. It was good you waited before you had her. Why? You were alone in Iran while Babak was here. It would have been difficult. That's true. Yes? Can I get a skewer? Yes, dear. What is it? I just got it today. Look at you. I didn't know you got a tattoo. I wanted the swelling to go down first. - Do you like it? - Yes. Does Babak like it? The other half is on his arm. How fancy. I know. I wanted one like yours. When we both decided to get it, I put it here. What is it? I really don't know. It was in the tattoo artist's book. You don't know? You're special. Well, it's very unique. What is it? This toothache's been killing me all night. I could have brought you something from the hospital. It came on so suddenly. Have you quit? Sort of. Neda's sensitive to it. She's asthmatic. I don't smoke in the house. Neda okay? Is she settled? We got into it again. She's homesick. She's trying to like it here for Shabnam's sake. Are you two happy? She's happy, and I'm happy. That's great. You're hardly around these days, Doctor. Since I was transferred to emergency... ...my job has become difficult. How hard could it be? You stick people with needles. What do you know? Ever been in a situation... ...where someone is brought to the ER under your watch, and as hard as you try to save them... ...there is no way? This morning, a young girl came in at 3:00 a.m. She was my last patient. Did you know her? You two are at it again? Mohsen says dinner is ready. Okay. Come on. Let's go have dinner. Guys, it's freezing. Don't come out. Spend the night. I know, but it's better we get back. Thanks for everything. Mohsen, thank you. We had a great time. My pleasure. - Thank you so much. - Bye, Elahe. Take this too, thank you. You okay? Yeah. I'll get it for you. You didn't finish your story. It's nothing, never mind. I told you a hundred times. Say it all, or don't mention it at all. I wanted to say something but didn't want it to ruin our night. Talk later. Take care of yourself. We'll talk later. Farhad, it's been our pleasure. Likewise. It was a great evening. Good night dear, thank you. I'll drive. Why? You want to drive like this? Why not? Because you're drunk. Give it to me. Better than having a suspended license. Get in. Come on, the baby is going to wake up. What was Farhad talking about? What's your deal with Farhad? You're both the same. You know how he is. He didn't look well. I asked, but he said nothing. Hello, Mohsen. Yes, brother? Forget it. Nothing I can do now. No, I'll get it when I see you. Okay. Thanks, it was a fun night. Bye. What did he say? I left my phone charger. Good you don't leave yourself behind. Let's head back and sleep there. I said we wouldn't stay. I won't go back. I want to sleep in my own bed. Are you paying attention? What is it doing? It's going crazy. It says to turn right. Go straight. Wait, let's see where it's saying to go. Be careful! You woke the baby. Move your hand, I want to go backwards. What for? You can't... There's no U-turn ahead. You can't reverse. Go straight. Stop talking. Oh, god. It's acting crazy. Keep your eyes on the road. There's something on the road. Be careful! You ran it over. What are you talking about? Just look where you're going! Don't drink if you can't handle it. You know how to ruin the night. You nag too much. Why are you sitting? Go check. What? Go check what? Go see what you did. What have I done? It's just a cat, so what? Why is everything such an issue? What happened? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? Nothing happened. What was that sound, then? Take a look for yourself if you don't believe me. Give me Shabnam's bag. Hi, baby. Sweetheart. Throw this in the trash. Come on. Please let me drive. Will you stop? What difference does it make? We should go back to Mohsen's house. I said we're not going back, so why should I go back? You're so stubborn. You won't let me drive, you won't go back. I don't want you to drive. You're not well. What's wrong with me? You don't pay attention. If you have it all figured out why did you lose your license to the police? What does that have to do with it? I didn't have my insurance. Let go of getting behind the wheel. 'My license wasn't with me.' Just leave it. You tell me, what should we do? - Tell me... - You reject everything I say. You tell us what to do, my love. I don't know. Let's go to a hotel. For a half hour drive? Half an hour ago you said, 'half an hour.' We've been driving around in circles for two hours. Think of the poor baby. Where are you going? You said go to a hotel. So let's go. - What can I do? - Do whatever you want. Is this it? Yes. Don't you want to go to a more crowded one? This was the closest one. It doesn't make a difference. Give me my sweatshirt. In the back. Wait. Let's go together. Bring Shabnam's bag. Stay back, what are you doing. Why did you do that? You okay? Forget him, let's go. What? Let's go inside. Good evening. Welcome to the Hotel Normandie. Hi. How are you doing? Good. Thanks. Who's the man by the front door? I'm sorry, I didn't see anyone. What, did something happen? He harassed my family. Oh, dear! I'll make sure, I look into that, don't worry. How many nights will you be staying? Tonight, just tonight. Oh, well you know we only have a suite available. That's fine. Good. What's your name? Babak Naderi. N-A-D-E-R-I. Could you please sign in right there on the pad? As you probably saw, we keep the doors locked at night. So if you ever would like to go out, just let me know and I'll open up the doors for you and your own room key, will let you in from the outside. Just please. Don't ever push the door. And here's your room key. Thank you. That is on the fourth floor room 414. And the elevator is right around the corner. Welcome to the Hotel Normandie. - Thank you. - Thanks. Where's Shabnam? I changed her clothes and put her in the other room. Is she sleeping there? Yes, it's comfortable. I'll take a shower, you get to bed. Okay. Neda. The baby is awake. Get up please, see what she wants. What is it, my love? What is it? My love. What is it? Sleep, my love. Sleep. Don't. Don't, my love. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Hi. Are you lost? Hey. Sleep, my love. Sleep. What is it... It was nothing... Here, my love. Take this. Sleep. What is it, dear? I'm here. Let's go downstairs. Come here, my love. Come here. What is it? Sit here. Yes, my love. Let's go. Let's get you some milk. It's okay, my love. Sir. Hello. Hello. Hello. Can I help you? I need to get some hot water, please. - Of course, follow me. - Thank you. - Oh, let me. - Thank you. - Oh, may I? - Sure. - She is so cute. - Thank you. You know I met Bobby Kennedy once? You know who that was? No, I don't. He was the Attorney General of the United States under his brother, President John Fitzgerald Kennedy. They were both assassinated. Oh yes. I've known a lot of people and I've been to many places. Paris, nightclub shootings. Puerto Rico, where a hurricane killed over 2000 people. Las Vegas in the Hotel Bellagio. I was here last week when that little African-American boy was shot and killed. And the ghost fire where the warehouse burned 40 people to death in front of my eyes. Oh yes. I've seen a lot of death. All sorts of it. But the worst, the worst. It's the death of a child that is very painful. Sometimes there's just no way out. You know, it's like quicksand, the more you struggle, the deeper you get in. Oh, I'm terribly sorry if my words disturbed you. Have a peaceful night. What are you doing here? When did you come downstairs? I came to get hot water for the baby. You can go. I'll put her to sleep. I said, you can go. I don't know why she's acting this way tonight. She's happy. She likes to play, I guess. Isn't that right? Go upstairs and sleep. I'll put her to sleep and come up. Are you sure? Did she sleep? What is it? What is it? What's wrong? Where's the baby? What do you mean, 'where's the baby?' What happened? Why is Shabnam here? You took her from me! I was asleep. You left the baby alone and came up? Give her to me. Give her to me! - Leave her alone. - Give her to me! Have you gone crazy? I handed her to you! What are you talking about? What if something had happened to her? Have you gone crazy? My sweetheart. Go upstairs. Let's go. I'll bring her myself. You go. Mommy's here. Neda... What's happened now? Nothing, sorry. Call if you need anything. Go to bed. I'm coming. What are you doing this late at night? Is Shabnam asleep? Yes. Babak... Why did you leave me? What? Why did you leave me? What are you saying... ...this late at night? Babak... Babak... Babak, open the door if you're awake. What? What's the matter? Why are you acting like this? I had a hard time getting her to sleep. I'm talking to you. Why are you staring like that? Give me the baby. You've lost it. I'm not letting you drink again. Give me the baby! Where were you? Where was I? Where was I? Have you lost your mind? Where were you just now? I can't even talk to you. You're being ridiculous. It's nothing sweetie, sleep. Turn off the light. It's nothing, my love. Just go to sleep. Sleep, my love. Sleep. Sleep my love. Babak, what's with you? I'm tired of this. Where were you, just now? What do you mean, 'where was I?' I was downstairs. Weren't you just sitting on that chair filing your nails? Babak, what are you talking about? I don't know what to... What's that? I heard it before. What's going on in this dump? Where the hell is he? - Where are you going? - I'm going upstairs to check. Excuse me. Hello. Sleep, sweetheart. Sleep. Sleep, sweetheart. Take a look. What is it? I didn't take this picture of Shabnam. You probably took it by mistake. You think I'm an idiot? I wouldn't forget taking a picture of Shabnam with my flash. You check on her with your phone's flashlight all the time. You touched it by mistake. What else could it be? Someone came into our room and took a picture of her with my phone. What was up there anyways? Nothing, it's the roof. Just a bunch of pipes. It's the pipes then... You exaggerate. Does that sound like pipes? Who is it? Who was it? Who was that? No one. Give me the phone. That's ridiculous. Do hotels have stalkers? Who are you calling? Hello, I wanted to report that my family is in a hotel and someone keeps disturbing us. There are no hotel staff around. We called. No, they haven't stolen anything. They're just disturbing us. No, I haven't seen anyone. We're staying in Hotel Normandie. My name is Babak Naderi. B-A-B-A-K N-A-D-E-R-I. We're waiting, thank you. What are the police going to do? We didn't see anyone. Let's go. Let's go. What do you mean? Let's go downstairs. Leave her, she was just falling asleep. What's with you tonight? Why are you acting like this, Babak? Come, get up. My head is exploding. Can I take a 10 minute nap? Let's go. Mommy... Mommy? Did you hear that? Yes. I'll go check. I'm drunk and hallucinating, what about you? I don't understand... ...what's happening now. It was very close. Who was he calling ‘mommy'? How would I know? I'm not even sure I heard him correctly. He called out ‘mommy' twice. How can you not be sure? Were you the ones that called? Yes. Are you surprised to see me? Weren't you expecting the police? Oh yes. How did you get in? The door was open. It should be locked. How did you find our room? The check-in book. It seems you're the only guests. Oh, really? May I come in? Sure, please. So how can I help you? Someone's been disturbing us all night. Can you explain exactly what's happened? The first time I was in the lobby, a woman came. When I went back, she was gone. I don't understand. I mean, there was someone in the lobby, but they disappear. They vanished. I don't know. Maybe. And second time there was a woman in our room right there. The same one that vanished? I didn't see her in second time. Can you confirm this? I'm not sure. Are you sure you weren't imagining this? No, it's happened twice. Are you taking anything? Like what? Just answer the question. Yes or no. Of course not. I don't do drugs. What's the smell on your breath. It's just my mouthwash. It has alcohol in it, you know? I have a toothache. Is there something that you're not telling me? No. Ask my wife. Someone was making noise on the roof. Someone's been knocking on the door. Did you see them? No, there was no one there. Look it's five in the morning. And you want me to find somebody knocking on your door? Who ran away in a hotel? They didn't run away. They vanished too. You came all this way to make fun of me? No, I'm not making fun of you. You're the one that's fooling me. I'm done. Look, please, sir, it's long night. Babak, stay calm. Don't get mad. Okay. I'm sorry. My wife is right. Before you came. We heard a child calling his mother from the bathroom. She heard it. Yes. True. So what about the child? The child wasn't there. Let me get this straight just like all the others. May I? Sure. Yes, my love. Sweetheart. So this is your only child? - Yes. - I thought you had another. Well, what do you mean? You said a child called out to you. I can see that your daughter's just a baby. No, he didn't call me. He just said mommy. Excuse me, sir. It seems you didn't understand exactly. No, I understood completely. You said you heard sounds, you said you saw people disturbing you but they're not here now. This isn't a police matter. You guys need to find yourself a ghost hunter. Ghost? Yeah. If he can catch it, and doesn't scam you. Are you messing with us? No, I'm not kidding. We deal in facts. Things we can see, not hallucinations. But I'm telling the truth. Your baby's beautiful. May I hold her? Yes. Come, my love. Oh thank you. Oh she's adorable. Take care of her. Do you have children? I did, a daughter. What do you mean "Did?" She was run over by a car. I'm sorry. Who is that? I don't know. It's probably my partner, let him in. Wasn't he just here? What happened? What... Come on. What is it? Your keys? Shit! Shit! Shit! Let me come, too. Stay, I'll be right back. Sir what do you want? They hear the truth, morning comes. They hear the truth, morning comes. You... You speak Farsi? Say it. What... What should I say? Neda, neda. Get in the car. Mommy? Let me play with my sister. Remember. What happened? Water... give me water. Get up. Let's go. Get up. Hey! Hey! Hey! Come here. Let's go upstairs. Where? Let's go upstairs. Get up. Get up! What are you waiting for? Do something. What do you want me to do? I don't know, call someone. Who? I don't know... Farhad... Mohsen. Hello... Hello, Farhad... Hello, Farhad, how are you? Farhad, sorry. I know it's 5:00 a.m. We came to a hotel... Hello... Hello... Farhad! Damn it! He's not answering? Hello... Hello, Farhad? Hello... Farhad? Farhad, we need help. Hello... do you hear me? It didn't ring... and you didn't answer Neda's phone. I don't know where my phone is. Maybe I left it in the car. I think Neda's phone is in the car. Listen to me. What's wrong with you? We came to this hotel, but something's happening to us. We can't figure it out. Hotel? What are you doing in a hotel? I don't have time to explain. We needed to spend the night somewhere. We ran out of gas... it doesn't matter. Get here as soon as you can. Now? Yes. Now. Why? There are people doing things... harassing us... I don't know... I... Who? Are you okay? I don't know. They're stalking us. I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's happening. Please get over here. Stop asking so many questions. Did you call the police? What about the receptionist? Yes, we did. No one is doing a damn thing! Please come, Farhad. Come! You said calling the police was useless? Now you're calling me. For what? What do you want me to do? What's he saying? Let me tell you something... ...put both of your minds at ease. Stop looking. There's no way out for you two. What're you saying, Farhad? Are you high? What are you talking about? There's no way out. There's no way out. There's no way out. There's no way out. Babak, could it be because of these? Because of what? These tattoos. Are you out of your mind? Don't talk nonsense. I don't know, maybe it's some kind of a curse. What's that got to do with it? Please don't start with any of your nonsense. What time is it? What time is it? What time is it? Why doesn't the sun rise? Why doesn't the sun rise? Why doesn't the sun rise? Why doesn't the sun rise? Babak, what happened to you? Mom... Mommy...? Mommy. Why aren't you telling dad what you did? Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. Say it. What's the matter, Neda? What's wrong? I didn't keep my baby. What? I didn't keep my baby. What are you talking about? The baby is okay sleeping there. What are you saying? Neda, talk to me. Five years ago... when you came here... ...I realized I was pregnant. I hadn't heard from you for a while. You were supposed to return... ...but you didn't. I didn't want to have a child without a father. I had an abortion. Why didn't you tell me? Where were you? You weren't there. I didn't think you'd come back. Get up, the baby is restless. Let's get out of here. The power is back. Get up, Neda. Let's get out of this shit hole. You... What are you hiding from me? What... what are you talking about? The man at the door... ...said, if they hear the truth, it'll be morning. As soon as I told the truth, the power came on. What are you hiding from me? This damned door's lock is busted. We just have to get out of here. That's all. Stay here until I return. Don't go anywhere. Where are you going? Stay there. I found another way out. Wait there until I come back. Why are you running away from me? Sophia. You said you loved me. You lied to me. You lied to me Why didn't you leave her? You did this to me. You did this. There's no way out. Say it. - No please. - Say it. Please, I'm sorry. - Say it! - Sorry, honey. Say it! Neda! Shab... Shabnam... Shabnam, what? Let me see, what happened? Let me see. Let me look at you! - Shabnam... - Shabman, what? Go... ...find Shabnam. Where is she? Go! Go... ...Shabnam. Shabnam. Is there something that you're not telling me? There's no way out. Sometimes, there's just no way out. You know it's like quicksand. Come with me. The more you struggle. - There is no way out. - The deeper you get in. There's no way out. Come with me. Come on. You can do this. Come with me. From the darkness of night... ...to the keeper of morning. From the darkness of night... ...to the keeper of morning. From the darkness of night... ...to the keeper of morning.
