It's in the paper. The driver uh, of the other um, he um, I guess it wasn't even his first, he was just a kid. So what am I supposed to do? I never done this before. Am I supposed to call... Do you want me to handle things? Anna's school called. Don't worry about any of that. That stuff will all take care of itself. Store, Gary. You should call Gary, you need to talk to him. Don't worry about anything else. Right now, you just need to you know? You just need to take care of you right now. It's gonna be okay. You're gonna get through this. Oh. Hey. Six bucks. Where are you headed? I don't know. I know how to get there if you don't know where you're going. You want a bag? No, thanks. Ride safe. I like your bike. Huh? Your bike. Okay, have a good night. Yeah, okay. Shifter? Yeah. It's pretty bent. You know about bikes? Oh, I grew up around bikes. Oh. Hey, did you hear the wind last night? Yeah. Kind of sounded like somebody was screaming, right? Okay, well I'm gonna head up the beach. Okay, see you later. All right sleepy guy, we're heading to school. Does Anna have her project ready? I wanna see it. Honey, she's already in the car. She's waiting for me. Fuck! No! Fuck! Coffee? Uh, no. Okay. Oh you know what, yes. I'm sorry, coffee. All right. Thank you. Thanks. Sorry, I've just been um, It's okay. No, just that water can get pretty cold this early, so. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I've got um, some more hot water and some coffee and stuff, if you wanna sit, if you want some company. Or just bring the mug back anytime, whenever. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Uh, hey, I have your mug. Okay. Should I get it? Sure. Thanks. Um, thank you for the gesture. Oh, no gesture, just warmth. Oh well, thank you. They have what you were looking for over there? Oh no, they, I need a tool. They don't have any tools in there, so. Is your motorcycle broken? Uh, I just dumped it in the desert horsing around, bent the shifter and it's hard to get into gear, so. Well, I gotta head into town today so if you want a ride. Okay. Yeah. All right, thank you. Got what you needed? Think so, it's worth a shot. I'm Tracey by the way, in case you were wondering. Huh? Oh my God, right. Right. Preston. Nice to meet you, Preston. Yikes. How long have you been on the road? Um, a couple of weeks, maybe more. I don't know, I haven't really been keeping track. What are you running from, Preston? Sorry? Relax. I'm just kidding with you. I do wanna ask you one thing, though. Can I have a ride on your motorcycle? Just a tiny little ride around the campground. It would mean so much to me. You want a ride on my bike? Okay. Really? Yes! I mean, it seems like it's the least I can do. You've given me a ride, after all. Hey. Hey. So I think she's fixed if you wanna... It's fixed? I think so. Yes, let's go. Oh, together? Oh, I was, I thought that maybe you could just ride around, you know, I mean, I could show you. No, no, come on, let's go for a real ride. You have to drive. Thank you for bringing me up here. So fun. Look at this, all of this is just happening, you know? Like, all the time. Man. Sorry, I'm gushing. I just get a little excited, you know? What's your story, huh? You love this. You're so nice and likable. Why are you out here camping by yourself? Why aren't you hanging out with your people? I don't mind being alone. Beside, I could say the same thing to you. No, I don't think so. I'm not very likable, at least not these days. Oh you're not? No, no. I'm Listen, Preston, whatever it is you're going through and I don't know what it is and I don't need to, but it's obviously something for you, it will pass. Things will get better if you choose to let them. Just because this sunset is fleeting, does it make the fact that it happened any less beautiful? It shouldn't. I mean, when you see that beauty, in and of itself, doesn't actually care about us, yet we still get to look at it, we get to hold it and love it. I don't know. What a gift, you know? Why you saying all this? I mean, who are you? I'm just I'm the woman who's about to take your photo right now and capture this beautiful moment for you. No. And someday, you'll thank me. Come on, dude, let's lighten things up a little bit... I'm not doing this, nope. Okay, give me some of that rugged, loner on the cliff-side. Um, wait, hold on. Did you get it? I got it. Done, are you gonna take this thing for a spin? You gonna ride this or not? Oh, well, it's been a while, but yes, - I would. - All right. - You gotta hold this. - Okay, I'll hold that and take that, good. There we go. Woo. Nice, here, gloves. Okay, gloves. Yeah, put those on. All right, just give me a little crash course here. I will, don't say crash. Uh well, I think I should turn in. Okay. Thanks, Preston. For what? I had a really good evening with you. Me too, thank you. Oh hey, give me your number so I can send you these pictures. Oh no, that's, that's okay. No, no, come on, I really want you to have them. Okay, um, could you just email 'em to me? I haven't turned my cellphone on this whole time - and it's just... - yeah. Uh, shoot. Okay, they are headed your way. All right, great. Thank you, goodnight. Night. Anna, Anna, oh, there she is, Grandpa Gary, there's your granddaughter. Anna, what are you doing? What are you doing, Anna? Texting someone? Who are you texting? Are you texting with a boy? Come on, dad, stop. Oh, is it possible she's... Dad, please, you're bothering me. Houston... Dad come on, I get an hour, you said so. Can I please, just let me enjoy it? What, huh, this isn't fun for you? What, hey, where are you going? You headed out? Yeah. Cool, where you going? Yeah, you know, I don't really know. Up North, I guess. Okay. What, is that okay with you? I don't even know you and seriously, what do you care where I go? No, I was just gonna see if you wanted to go for a hike, but you're headed out, so. Well bike's fixed, don't need to be here. Okay. Take care of yourself, Preston. I will. Hey Doc, can I get another? Yeah. - There you go. - Appreciate it, thanks. Yo, whiskey neat. Is he serious? It's fine, he's just having a rough night is all. Well he's gonna be having a lot harder of a night if he can't muster up some manners. I'm sorry. Are you talking to me? What if I am talking to you? Look, I don't want any trouble all right? You're just a kid. I'm just a kid? Look, if I said something then I'm sorry, okay? Look, why don't you just keep sucking 'em back and crying into your drink over there and keep your fuckin' mouth shut! Okay, that's enough. Just leave him alone, he's fine. You just gonna stare at me now? Hey, I said that's enough. Go. Sorry, you're fine. My bad. All righty then, it's time for this stallion to split it and hit it. Good night, darling. Thank you, as always. Are you okay to get yourself home? Yes, I am. I should be able to make it at least most of the way. Would you take him home? He's a big boy hon, I ain't driving him nowhere. Yeah, I'm a big boy, darling. Someone just take him home. How can all of you people let this idiot get behind the wheel of a car? Well look who's got something to say? And who are you calling an idiot? You. Just take my keys? The fuck is wrong with you? You know, it's all fun and games and nothing matters until you kill someone. Until you go out there and kill some beautiful, innocent child who just wants to get to school that day so that she can share her homework of a class project, sustainable farming for inner city neighborhoods that she's been working on so hard and all she wants to do is help people. And then there's you. What have you done for the world, huh? You know, you should do yourself a favor and just die. That way, you don't have to live with it. No, no, no, I'll do that. That'll be my job from now on. You come walking in here, killing brain cells you don't have to spare and then go out there killing daughters and mothers and ruining families... What the fuck are you blabbering about, you fuckin' nut job? Sh, sh, sh. You know, what you should do is you should go get yourself a gun, put the barrel in your mouth and pull the trigger and do the whole fuckin' world a favor, you pathetic, worthless waste of skin and... Hey buddy, you want your credit card? Oh shit, you need some help, pal. No, I'm okay, thanks. Yeah, you look it. I'm okay, thank you. Suit yourself. If you're still here when I'm going home, I'm calling the cops. Oh shit, you're still here. Oh, I'm sorry, someone's coming to get me. I can't ride. Well why didn't you let me get you some help a long time ago? You're a real glutton for punishment. I know. But, it's okay. There she is. This is my ride. He with you? No, no, but I'll help him. Yeah, good luck with that, sweetheart. Preston, are you okay? Oh my god, I'm taking you to a hospital... No, no, no, I got it, I got it. There's a motel down the road, would you just mind taking me there? Yeah, um, what about your motorcycle? I don't care, just leave it. You don't have to stay here tonight, I'll be okay. Uh, actually, I do. The campground gate doesn't open until 9:00 a.m., so. Oh. Okay. Oh whoa, no. Just stay there. You're gonna wait 'til the bath water runs and then you can get up. Oh. He really let you have it, huh? It's okay. Let it happen, Preston. My wife and my baby are dead. They were killed in an accident by a drunk driver. She was just taking her to school. It was 7:30 in the morning. They were my whole world. He took everything from me. They were everything I ever wanted. They were everything I ever needed. It's like this thing happened and then my whole life was erased in the blink of an eye and I have nothing left except this numbness and the knot of hatred in my heart and I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know how I'm supposed to go on. How am I supposed to live with this? I have nothing left, I mean, how am I supposed to live? By letting it in. Preston, you let it in so that you can let it go. You can do this. You need to get this out of you. And breath and you keep breathing. You keep breathing, let it in and let it go. This is your first step. This is good, Preston, this is good. This is your first step and this is a big step and I want you to recognize that, okay? Yeah. That's good. Good. All right, let's get you into the tub, okay? Yeah. Okay. You sure you're gonna be able to ride? Yeah. It's gonna hurt a little, probably, but I'll be okay. You sure? Yep. Okay. I owe you an apology. No, you don't, you don't owe me anything. I do, I owe you an apology for the other day and then here you are bringing me back up here. Thank you. It's nothing, Preston. I didn't take it personally. I know better than that. Yeah. Just take care of yourself. You be gentle with yourself. You're worth it. Just remember let it in, let it go. Some days will be easier than others and that's okay. Look around you, life is beautiful. Trust me, you'll be okay. Thanks. Morning. I mean, I didn't know what to think. You don't say anything, you just, you just disappear. Nobody knows where you are. I go over there, the house is empty. Sorry Gary. I start checking around with anybody I could find at the store and then, when I can't get a hold of ya, I start thinking the worst. I know, I know, I shoulda stayed in touch. Yeah. I mean Preston, come on. I can relate. I lost my wife eight years ago to cancer. I lose my daughter, I lose my little grand baby. There is no, there's no words. Let me tell you something, man, that kind of hurt will break you if you let it. I know. - Okay? - Yep. Yep. Theo loved you more than anything and nothing made my wife and I happier than the day that the two of you got married, nothing. We're family. Thank you, I'm so sorry, I just, got in a bad way and I'm just trying to get my feet back under me. I find, hey, you know what? No, you gotta handle this any way you can, any way you know how. You have to handle it your way. But I want you to look around here, man and look at this, look where we are. Mm, look at this. You are way too young to be throwing in the towel in your life right now. Okay, Theo would not have it, all right? She would not let you stop going on living your life because of this. She wouldn't. I'm not gonna let you either. You wanna honor her and Anna? Then you dig yourself out of this any way you can, every single day of your life. Get up in the morning and think, how can I move forward? You know I'm telling you the truth. Yeah, I do. You know Theo would accept nothing less. - Right? - I do. Give me a hug man, come on. You can do this. I'm gonna be there for you no matter what. I'm gonna be there for you too, Gary, I promise.
