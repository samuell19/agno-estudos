- You the new girl? - Yes. Hi. - Okay, well, I've been out front looking for you for the past 15 minutes. - Oh, I'm sorry. I, they told me to wait here. - All right, come on. I wanna get to the lanes before they run outta half price wings. Supplies are in here. We run low on anything, you write it down on this clipboard. Got it? Your shirt should be over there. What'd you say your name was? - Um, Karen. - My ex-wife's name was Karen. - I'm sorry. Hey, Tina. Is everything okay? How is she feeling? She threw it up again? I was really hoping she'd keep something down. Um... Maybe next time try again with some crackers. Uh, just try that and yes, please clean it up. Thank you again for staying with her. I've gotta go. - Is that gonna be a problem? - No, no. I'm sorry. I've got a sick little one at home. My neighbor's with her and she has kids but she acts like she's never seen a sick one before. - The boss man doesn't take too kindly to personal business on his dime, so don't have that out anymore. - Got it. - Have you worked in a place like this before? - No, sir. - You can see it's dirty. Floors need to be swept each night. Bathrooms. Clean 'em, mop 'em, refill the soap, paper towels, TP. Empty the trash from each office. Vacuum each office and hallway. Close all the doors. Make sure they're locked. We had a break in at a plant down the road the other night. We don't want that here. Why don't you go get these. Also, no smoking inside. - I don't smoke. - You will if you stay here long enough. You married? - Why? - Just asking. You said you had a kid and all. - No, I'm not. - This one's a little tricky. You really gotta work it. Oh, I hate this door. - I think you got something on, um- - Ah, dammit. - Wait, wait. Don't, don't rub it in. Hold on. Give me your shirt. I have an old injury. Can you open this? - What the hell? Where did you learn that from? - School. Good old family and consumer sciences class. - Sounds made up. - Oh, it's real, all right. - Don't think by knowing this fancy stuff you're gonna be getting my job or nothin'. - Don't we have the same job? - No, I'm day shift. - There you go. - Not bad, Kathy. - It's Karen. Like your ex-wife. - Yeah, right. Well, I'm off. Any last questions? - Does anybody else work night shift? - Nope. Just you. I, uh, hope your kid gets to feeling better. - Thank you. - Well look at this shit. - Mm-mm-mm. Fresh meat. - Nah, this is Danny's old lady. - No shit? - Or ex old lady, guess I should say. Ain't that right? Whoa, careful. Don't wanna burn yourself now. You know she served him divorce papers right there at the construction site. In front of his foreman and everybody. - You don't know me. - I know anyone gonna deny a man from seeing his little girl on her birthday is a fuckin' bitch. - Come on, man. - You missed a spot. - Shit. Oh, it's nasty. Hey, Tina. - I know you said not to call, but your kid is crying and I can't get her to stop. - Is she okay? - I don't know. She's going on about her dad's gone, you're gone. I told her you're just at work, but she won't listen. You want me to say what happened to her dad? - No, no, don't say anything. Just... - What do I need to do? - Okay, um, let me talk to her. - Mom? - Hey baby. What's the matter? Are you okay? - Where are you? - I'm at work. Remember I told you I was going to be working while you're asleep? - No. - Yes, you do. That's why Miss Tina's there to watch you. - Are you coming back? - Yes, of course I am. I'll be there when you wake up. I promise. And then we'll make breakfast. Okay? - Eggs Benedict? - No, maybe pancakes. - Okay. - Okay, baby. I love you. - Love you, too. - Can you give the phone back to Miss Tina? - Yeah. - Yeah? - I'm sorry about that. I think she'll be all right. How's her fever? - I dunno. - Well, will you take her temperature? - Pretty sure it's gone. She don't feel hot. - Will you just take it with a thermometer and text me back and let me know? - Fine. I'll do it in a minute when things settle down. - What things? - Well, this dog out here is barking like crazy. Shut up dog! Ugh. Oh, and the land lady stopped by. Said you still owed for this week. - I know. I'm taking care of that. - I saw you got a lot of bills here. Are you gonna be able to pay me? - Yes. Now will you take her temperature and stop going through my mail? - Fine. - Hey, thank you again for watching her. I really do appreciate- Hm. - Hello? - Delivery. - Can you leave it by the door? - I need a signature for it. Sorry I'm running late. The truck got a flat. They put a rush on this, so I figured it's important. Machine part, I'm guessing. Is Frank here? - No. - What about Wayne? - Nope. - Anyone besides you? - No. Uh, well, well, there's the people in the back, but- - Take care. - Do I need to sign for this? - No, you're good. Hey. - Oh, shit. Fuck. - Now find her. - See anything? - No. Check back here. Guys, this way. - Shit. - Ow! - Dammit! - Here, here's here phone. - Fuck. - Spread out. Hey, go find every phone. Start cuttin' the lines. - Piece of shit. Ugh, this fuckin' place. - Hey, go check on the breaker box. I don't think it's the one down here. - Hey, I might have something over here. - You sure in the clear? Anybody check that closet right there? - The longer you drag this out, the more we're gonna make you bleed, bitch. - Fuckin' bitch. Don't go runnin' little piggy. Your ass is mine now. Fuckin' hell. I see you. You ain't gettin' away. - Fuck. - Bitch! Come here, you slippery little bitch. Fuck! You ain't gettin' away! Come here! Oh, shit! - Piece of shit. - Hey, hey, hey! No, Eddie. - Take the note. - No Eddie, hey. - Come on, go. - What happened? - Just leave. He's fuckin' dead, man. - Listen. - Shit. - Yeah, I hear it. - Over there. Go, come on. You're in a shit ton of trouble now, bitch. She's over here. I can smell her. Mm, I smell her, too. Smells like trash. Dirty, dirty trash. Dirty... Dirty girl. Ain't no use hidin'. Come on out. Come out, dirty girl! We know you're up here. Come out, dirty girl. Check that aisle over there. I got this one. Hey! Get your ass back here. She's over here. She's running! Don't let her get away! - Yeah, I see her. - She's getting away, go! Get her! Hey, where'd she go? - She's hidin'. Somewhere close. - She can't get out. The phone lines are cut and the doors are chained shut. Vic is keeping watch outside. She's stuck in here. Let's find her. - Think. Think. - Hey. - Give me those. - Fuck. - Hey Bobby, right here. Right here. - Hey sweetheart. Come here! Open the fuckin' door. - Shit. Shit. - Fucker. - Shit. Oh, fuck. - I seen 'em come down this way. Bi-itch!

What is that? - Look at this. - Shit, that's Bobby's iron. - Is this his blood? - Check the closets. She's not fuckin' in here. - Is she in here? - She's close. Maybe she doubled back around. Anyone check the rough mill? Bobby. That fuck. Where the hell is he? You think she got him? That's a lot of fuckin' blood over there. Hey Vic, get down here. Take the keys and go check all the offices. Thoroughly. - I'm on it. - Go head down to the rough mill. See if Bobby's still down there. When I find this bitch, I'm gon' slit her fuckin' throat. - It's too fucking long. - Oh! Come here! - Got ya! Oh, we gonna play now. Get up! We gonna play real nice. That's right. Open up your mouth. Open up. - What? No. No, no, no, no. No. - Karen! Come here. - Shit. - Why'd you do this? Danny. I know it's you. Answer me. You won't get Lily - Too late. Did you really think I was gonna let you leave and take my little girl from me? Get used to it. I'm gonna knock every single tooth outta your fuckin' head. This is what happens when you try to pull some bullshit like this. You're not smart enough, Karen. Look at me. Look at me! You're so fucking stupid. Don't pick that up. You pick it up and I will break your fucking hand again. Come here. You never fucking listen. - No. - This is why you are such a fuck up. Give me the other hand. - No. - Karen, you gonna listen this time? Give it to me. - Please, Danny stop. No, please. No, stop. Danny, please, stop. No. Danny, please. - You turned on me. I gave you everything and you turned on me. - Mommy? - Lily? - Mommy? Mommy? - Lily. - Goddammit, I told you to stay in the car. - Lily! - Mommy! - Lily! No. - Mommy! No! - Lily! - Mommy! No! No! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Mommy! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Mommy! - Karen. Stop acting like you're smart. Get out here and I'll make it quick, like I did that stupid bitch you left my little girl with. Fuck. Karen! - Mommy! Mom! No! Mom! Mommy! - Fucking die already. Fucking die. - Take that mask off. Take it off! - Okay, please. I'm sorry. Please. - Get used to it. I'm gonna knock every one of your teeth outta your fuckin' head! - Mommy! - Lily. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? - I'm okay. Are you okay? - I'm okay. You're okay. Everything is okay. Everything is okay.
