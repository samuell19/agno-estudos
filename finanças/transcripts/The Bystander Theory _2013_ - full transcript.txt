I want you to acknowledge that I'm a little terrified here. >> Well, I am curious to know what Ben's lawyer wanted to talk to you about? >> Shame? >> Felix. Felix, Liz. Liz, my producer, Felix. Felix is well trained in the art of extricating me from uncomfortable conversations. >> Well, I got those prints you wanted. >> Good. They got somethin', huh? This is from the old camera we found. Let's see. Hotel. I don't know, she's-she's all covered up. Emma, maybe. It's mostly, amateur surveillance stuff. >> That's definitely Emma. >> How can you tell with all the getup? >> 'Cause I'm wearin' that coat right now. I recognize the man, too. >> You're kidding. Who? >> Well, don't keep me in suspense. How'd an old man get lucky enough to see you twice in a week? >> Bill, we wanna talk to you about a photograph. >> Really? >> Can you tell us if that is a picture of you and Emma? >> Let me see. I believe it is. >> Do you remember when that was? >> Bill, I don't mean to embarrass you, but do you mind if I ask you a delicate question? >> You want to know if I was seeing Emma? I enjoy your radio show. Some of your callers need to have their heads examined, but it's a good listen. >> Thank you. >> I was the one who sent you that letter. The one about Ben. >> Bill? >> Mr. Mills, what do you know about Ben's involvement in the assassination? >> There was no involvement. It was a fabrication on my part. One for which I'm sorry. >> Bill, how can that be? Everything that we have looked at points-- >> Yes, we know that he was in Dealey Plaza on the day of the murder. >> Ben was in Dallas that day, that's a fact. But, so was Emma, and so was I. >> I don't understand. >> Elizabeth, there was a time when your grandparents were happy together. Truly so. But in the years after the war, Ben's drinking took a toll on the marriage. He changed, grew angry. Emma was a fine, upstanding woman, but everyone has their breaking point, I suppose. She strayed from the marriage, it's true, but not as a habit and certainly not with me. I was there that day to help, I really was. On the morning the President was shot, Anne was calling on Emma. >> Ben? Emma home? ♪ What are you doing? >> You know who she's with, don't you? Who is it? >> I don't know what you're talking about. Ben? >> I know she's lying. Her sister, they're both liars. >> What about her sister? Where are you going? Are you going to Dallas? >> Anne found me straight away. Said Ben was on his way to Dallas with the worst of intentions. So, we decided that I should follow after him. Do what I could to prevent something terrible from happening. A few hours later, I was in Dallas convincing Emma's sister to tell me where to find her. It was still mid-morning when I tracked her down. She was very upset, of course. Told me there was no reason to worry and that I should go on home. Said she was going downtown to see the President. >> Thank you. That was the last time I ever saw her. I suppose Ben had the same idea about Emma and I that brought you two here today. Ben must have followed me from Emma's sister's house. Nobody knew where I was. I spent that night unconscious in a Dallas Hospital. Emma had disappeared by the next day, and we never spoke to Ben again. >> He was just in Dallas to follow his wife? >> If Ben had murder on his mind that day, it wasn't directed at the President of the United States. >> Why did you send the letter? >> It was my understanding that Ben wasn't in the best of health. And I had the foolish notion that if he felt himself under pressure, he might admit what had really happened to Emma. Maybe a last chance to confess his sins. Looks like all I managed to do was to waste your precious time. >> What are you thinking about? >> There has to be more. What are we not seeing here? And why the goons? >> I don't know. It could be completely unrelated to Bill's letter, or any of this. I'm seeing Jason later. He's probably a wreck. What are you doing? Seamus? >> Yeah? >> Are we done here? Was that the end? >> A lot of well wishes today. That's been nice. >> Are you gonna be okay? >> I was busy with arrangements all day. I'm sure it will hit me later. >> What do you think happened? >> I don't know. People fall. Thanks again for dinner. I'm really glad you're here. >> Of course. >> Why don't we talk about something else? Um, how was your day? >> Well, I got to visit Bill Mills. >> Yeah? How is old Bill doin'? >> He's such a sweet guy. >> Yeah. >> Listen, um I understand if you want to be alone tonight, but I can stay. >> I don't want to put you out. >> It's fine. You shouldn't be alone. >> Thank you. >> Yes? >> Mr. Fuller, my name is Caroline Ambrose. I work for the Kilgore Law Firm. >> What can I do for you? >> Elizabeth Jennings is in danger. >> Please. >> I didn't know who to turn to. I think he killed Alistair. >> Who-who did? Ms. Ambrose, tell me what's going on. >> Jason. He's after a film. >> What? Jason Kilgore? What film? >> It's a film of the Kennedy assassination. Ben indicated that it contained evidence of conspiracy. >> What? >> The film was taken by Emma Clayworth. >> Emma? No, she-- >> Near the end of his life, Ben confided in Alistair and Jason about the film, but not where it was. His instructions to Alistair were to make Elizabeth aware of the film and help her with whatever she chose to do with it. Alistair ultimately decided that knowledge of such a thing would be a burden to Elizabeth. But yesterday, he told me he changed his mind. He wasn't given the chance to tell her. ♪ >> God. >> What is it? >> Emma was the Babushka Lady. >> The what? >> Yeah, she, uh, she was the woman at the site of the assassination. She had the scarf... the babushka, and they never found her. >> Oh, my gosh. >> And she was shooting home movies. But why would Jason murder for it? >> What would you say a film like that would be worth, Mr. Fuller? Alistair never could admit it to himself, but, Jason is a deeply troubled man. >> Liz was going over to Jason's tonight. Where does he live? >> I'm sorry. Do you mind if I take this? >> No, of course not. >> Thanks. >> Hello? >> It's Shame. Shame? >> Get out of there. It's Jason. >> Hello? >> The sheriff is on the way. >> God! >> Oh, yeah. ♪ >> You okay? >> I have to go, sorry. Get out of my way. >> You're going to need to go back inside. >> Jason, what is this? >> Just sit down, Liz. >> Who are these guys? >> The help. Sit. ♪ You really have no idea what's going on, do you? >> Obviously. >> You and your fat sidekick were chasing around the wrong Clayworth. >> What, are you saying that Emma was involved? >> Just a bystander. >> So? >> A bystander with a position on top of the motorcade, standing at the precise angle, pointing her 8mm camera directly at the grassy knoll. It's cute, Ben to leave it in Emma's coat pocket. It's obvious, but cute. She's in a ton of pictures, home movies. Zapruder film, even. The Feds really wanted to get their hands on that film. But, poof, Emma just disappeared. Personally, I think Ben waxed her, but we'll never know. ♪ Come on, Liz. Grandma was a famous mystery woman. Who knew? >> How could you? >> Oh, come on. Don't be so naive. Why do you think they killed JFK? Money. That Babushka Lady footage? It's a holy grail of conspiratorial evidence. Hell, the pay-per-view alone will make me rich. >> You killed Alistair. >> He took a tumble. It happens. >> Over a roll of film. >> I said he took a tumble. He had his time, now it's mine. ♪ >> Jason, let me go. ♪ >> That's mine now. Legal documents will now show that Ben bequeathed the film to Alistair and the estate left it to me. It's all very tidy. I want you to know that I really did consider cutting you in on this, it's just that there's so many people involved, and it, it's just messy. >> You're a sociopath. >> Liz, for what it's worth, I mean, I had a good time. ♪ >> You shouldn't have done that. ♪ >> All this and you haven't even watched the film yet. It could be picnics and parades for all you know. >> Shut up. ♪ >> Perfect. >> You shut up! ♪ >> Hey. Uh-uh. ♪ >> Here we go. ♪ What the hell? ♪ Find her. Go! ♪ Drop it. Go on. ♪ Liz! I got your friend here with a gun pointed at his head. >> Liz, get out. Just get out of the house. >> Think about it. You really want me to put a bullet in him over a piece of film? Good. ♪ Give me the film. >> Liz? You remember what you told me? It's not worth a life. >> Yeah. >> Listen to your buddy. Give me the film. ♪ Come on, come on. >> You deserve this. >> No!

You and the breakfast tacos. >> State food of Texas. Did you get any sleep last night? >> Of course not. You? >> Not a wink, and I have to go on the air tonight. >> Oh, no. >> Wish I had something to talk about. >> Shame, do you think that was it last night? The real film? >> You mean, do I think we destroyed evidence that finally proved conspiracy in the murder of JFK? >> Yeah. >> Ask me something else. There's a buyer. You want me to give them the dime tour? >> I got it, thanks. ♪ May I help you? >> Elizabeth? ♪ >> Emma? >> No, sweetheart, I'm your Aunt Meredith.

She was kind and giving, and she was so funny. She was my best friend. >> I wish I could have met her. >> You're beginning to remind me of her already. I believe the two of you would have been thick as thieves. >> Do you know what happened? >> Elizabeth, over the years, I went to the authorities. I hired detectives. I raised seven kinds of holy hell, but I could never learn the truth. And then a few weeks ago, I received a letter. It was from Ben, himself. That took several days for me to even be able to read it. >> Tell me. ♪ >> The evening after Ben followed Emma to Dallas, they fought terribly. Emma would take no more of Ben's drunken behavior, and he certainly wasn't going to accept another man in her life. She was packed and ready to leave for good. We spoke that night by phone and I could hear the fear in her voice. She knew he was capable of anything, and was worried that he might have done something to their friend, Bill Mills. She... told me she loved me and... and that was it. Emma confronted him. She tried to reason with him. But Ben had a gun. He said in his letter that he was going to turn it on himself. He said he would never have intentionally hurt Emma. ♪ >> No. Emma, Emma, Emma. No. Talk to me. Emma. Emma, say something. >> He told people that she had run off to be with a lover. In those days, a man could get away with such contemptible deceit. Ben did. ♪ >> Where are we? >> I want to introduce you to your grandmother. ♪ Ben's letter provided directions to this place. After all these years. >> It's beautiful. ♪ There's something here. >> I believe that's for you, dear. ♪ >> You'd get about four or five minutes of footage out of one of those rolls of 8mm. The one you found in the coat must have been the roll before. So, Emma was shooting, she ran out of film, she reloaded, and-- >> Don't even think about it. Alright. Are you ready? >> Are you kidding? ♪ ♪
