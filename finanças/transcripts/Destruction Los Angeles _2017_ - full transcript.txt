Your cousin, he's so hot. His voice is liquid panty remover. I can confirm that is not true. Y'all give it up for DJ Twist. Hey! Congrats, your new album is amazing! - Glad you could make it. - This is Dana and Chrissy. - Hi. - Hey, beautiful. Hi. Hey, look. Enjoy the party, have fun. Whatever you need, I'm here. I have to make some rounds. - Okay? - Okay. And that is Marcus, girls. - Brooke! - Jay! - Hey. - Hey. - Can we get a picture? - Yeah, me too. - Absolutely. - Thank you. Marcus! Get in there. What is that? Yo, it's on TV! Hey, how is it going? Hi. Bad vibes in here today. Go ahead. Can you speculate what might have happened? Should our residents be concerned? We're investigating all kinds of possibilities, from a leaking gas main to arson. But we do have an expert from the USGS and he is on site and will be assessing to see if this is a natural gas buildup. Like the 1985 Fairfax explosion. Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us Dr. Paul Grant from the United States Geological Survey. Dr. Grant, how could this have happened? Deep, minor earthquakes rupture beneath us all the time. Not enough for us to feel it at the surface, but some of these quakes shift the rock underground and release pockets of trapped gas, like methane. Shouldn't we be able to smell a gas leak? We add a chemical to natural gas so that we can detect it by odor, but if a fissure or pocket under the shop was leaking concentrated methane into an enclosed area, no one would know. All gas lines running here have been shut them off, but the fire's still burning. It suggests methane bubbling up from underneath the ground may be our best theory so far. If I may, John? Most of Los Angeles is built over former oil wells. The city sealed two earlier this year. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Back to you, Olivia. Good job. - Hey, thanks for the on camera. - Yeah, no problem. Hey, I forgot the tickets. Can you guys meet me at the center before my lecture? - Yeah, sounds good. - Great. Hold on. Can you run those models again? - I got to take this. - Yes, no problem. See you later. Hey, you're here? No, we're about an hour out. I cannot wait to see you. Yeah, the forecast looks good. Wait until you move here. Every day is absolutely beautiful. - Did you get our tickets? - Of course. Listen to this. The CA Energy Center houses more than 30 renewable energy exhibits, including the new history of fossil fuels-- My God, Derek. We are not doing that. You don't have to go. Look, we'll all go, okay? It's a family thing. We'll do what Brooke wants tomorrow. No, John. We're shopping with Margot tomorrow. Aunt Margot got me into Marcus' record party. - When is that? - I told you about it, remember? Chrissy and Dana are gonna pick me up. - Who? - Pick you up... ...and drop you off, right? I can get a ride with Marcus or Jill, whatever. What? Today? They have a dinosaur hall, and the Science Center is right next door. You'll have so much fun with your Dad. I got to go, all right? I'll meet you guys back at the house later. Are they sirens? - What are you doing? - Is everything okay? Yeah, just another day in LA. Don't worry, okay? I love you guys. Okay, bye. - See you later, Dad! - Bye. Bye-bye. - Liv? - John, monitor. Hey! Anyone from Emergency Management show? Not here. We need a statement. Why aren't they investigating? I'll find out where Garcia is. I don't think the Chief of Police is ready... - ...to make a statement. - Science is boring. Earthquakes, methane, we get it. What about a possible link to terrorism? We're scared when the people who are supposed to protect us aren't there. Are we leading on this? If you get something we can sell. - All right. I'm on it. - When does your family arrive? - A couple of hours. - Good. Perfect. You've got time. I'm texting you names and addresses. Okay. See you. - Got the keys? - Yeah. - I'll drive. - All right. Mom, do you know where that book Dad sent me is? I want to get it signed. Did you check your whole backpack? - I checked. - Then, I don't know where it is. - Maybe you didn't bring it. - I know I packed it! No, no, no, no, no! Lower the volume. Derek, just calm down. Start from the beginning. Never mind. Okay, hit me with the C's. - Cell, charger, cash. - You are good, man. You should give him extra cash. He's gonna be with Dad. You know he's going to ask about your applications. - You should tell him. - You first. Radiometric dating of animal bones from the La Brea Tar Pits show the oldest fossil to be 38,000 years old. Wow. Slow down. Almost there. - Is it the next one or...? - Wait, this is it! Wow. Look at that house. I could get used to the one percent. Wow! Here we go. Beautiful. Okay. Finally! What freeway did you take? I think we came in on the Five Interstate. After 10, you have to stay off the I5, the 405 is better. I missed you so much. Come here. This house is amazing. Look at your babies! Hi, Aunt Margot. Yeah, they have their moments. - I love your shoes. - Thank you. We are going to have so much fun. Come on. Come on in. You can drop your stuff here. I'll give you guys a quick tour. - Look at that TV. - And there's a pool! Go on. Help yourself to anything. You still think I should marry for love? I think you should go to college. Brooke, you and Derek are there. Cathy, I set you up this time here. And here we have Marcus' messy room. Sounds about right. - Great. - Yeah. So, did you check out those schools I sent you? In LA., we've got great private schools here. Derek doesn't need a private school. - He's doing great. - Is he still on meds? It's not that kind of problem, Margot. It's not a problem at all. Um, okay. So well, there's the pool out here... ...hot tub, lounge on the chairs, wherever. - This is beautiful. - Thank you. God, it's so nice out here. We can do a little barbecue, and here we are back at the kitchen. Nice. Can I pour you a glass of wine? - No, thank you. - No, she'll have a glass. Yes, I will have a glass. Thank you. That's good, thanks. And I have something for you. VIP passes? - This is so cool. - Yeah. Brooke is writing some of her own music. No. It's just a few things. It's nothing like Marcus. It starts in a few hours with the label event and then the after party. Marcus knows you're coming. God, Dana and Chrissy are gonna lose their minds. Friends from Iowa, neighborhood girls who moved out here about a year ago. What about you? It's Dad! Dad is on TV! - If I may, John. - Yes, sir. Most of Los Angeles is built on former oil wells. There was an explosion. - That's awful. - Thank you, gentlemen. Back to you, Olivia. A dramatic morning. That was John Benson on the scene of a fatal explosion in West Hollywood. We're hearing now authorities have evacuated-- Dad's boss is hot. In this area of the explosion, that now has forced more than 20 of the buildings to evacuate in that particular zone. Firemen are still pulling the rubble apart searching for clues as the source-- Hey, did they mention how the fire started? It's really cool. Dad was talking about subterranean methane that seeped into the floor and kaboom. Derek! Come on! People are turning to social media to share their stories. We'll continue to follow developments on this story throughout the day. We'll get them to you as quickly as we can. Olivia, this has been scary stuff. City and state officials have capped two abandoned oil wells in Echo Park saying that the safety of residents... ...is their top priority. Coming up, more videos from-- - Do you feel that? - Earthquake. We're having an earthquake. Come on! Let's go! - Where? - Go under the table! Okay! Whoa! That was a good one. Is everyone okay? We're still feeling this here in the studio. Yeah, we don't know where this is centered yet, but we'll get to work on it as reports-- It's just a scratch. - What? - It's just a scratch. - Come here! - It's just a scratch. Yeah. We got to clean that up. Here. Just put some pressure on it. Nothing like an earthquake after lunch to shake up your afternoon. Scary stuff. We don't know where this is centered. People are calling in now as we pinpoint the center of the quake. I know you felt that back at the studio. What's your guess? I'm guessing it lasted a long time, maybe thirty seconds here felt like maybe a five to me. I'll put my money on 5.2. Yeah, I'm checking social media now. One tweet from some guy out there who says it felt like a bus was hitting his house. So it's been strong. Yeah, tweet us your guesstimates at #LAnewsquake as to the magnitude... - ...of the quake. - Okay, that's enough. Let me see your hand. So what happens now? We open another bottle. Hit the pool. Margot, I mean the aftershocks. Probably, but it's nothing really. It's fine. Really, it's all right. It's not the Big One. No, you need to cancel your plans with Chrissy. - Mom! - Cathy, it's fine. The party is still gonna happen. The girls should go. - Dad is on his way. - He's still on TV. - Not anymore. He's coming. - Sure. He said so. - He says many things. - Okay, okay. Let's just make a plan in case something happens. Absolutely. We can all check in with you, and if we can't get ahold of people, - we'll meet back here. - Yeah. See, Mom? It's fine. That's perfect. Okay? It's kind of fun, right? Totally. All right. Don't clean that up. You don't have to clean anything. Come on. Worry in fear to be ourselves and be measured, but not good enough. A constant inside the negative mind. Do not be afraid to try. The life worth living is full of all the moments we've chased our dreams. Let your positive mind lead, hope, inspire, achieve, believe in yourself. Self-confidence is the key to self-improvement, growth and success. With the tools of the positive mind, we frame challenges and obstacles as opportunities to test ourselves and learn. Cathy! Brooke? Derek! - Hey, Dad. - Honey! - When did you get here? - How are you? Um, Derek, Dad is here. I've gotta go. My ride is here. Brooke! Come on! I'm coming! Honey, I just got here! - I'm sorry. - Honey, your tickets! Thank you. You're the best! - Have fun. - Thank you. I'm sorry. Hey! Hello, John. Hey, Margot. Looks like the place got rocked a little bit. Hey, I thought maybe you weren't coming. I was just-- Working, yeah. We saw you on TV. Thank you. So where is Brooke going? To Marcus' record party, remember? - I told you about that. - Come on, we're gonna miss it. Hey, bud. - You look great. - Thank you. - Yeah. - I brought those papers for you. - Yeah, did you tell them? - No. We're gonna tell them together. You said we'd meet him. Let's go! - Just a minute, bud. - I've been waiting for hours! Well, how about tonight? Family dinner. That thing people do together, with food and conversation and about how school was today. Just because you weren't there doesn't mean those things don't happen, John. How about a Dodgers game? I mean, you love baseball. Those papers are gonna be signed during this visit. - Who says? - We do! We had a conversation, you and I! We have to go now. - Okay. - You'd better go. Okay. See you tonight. Later. Have fun! Come on! Come on, Dad! This is gonna give me an A on my science project. Hello? Yeah, we're right outside. All right. See you in a second. All right. Here we are. This is magnificent. So, why aren't you going? That's Marcus and Jay's thing. I stay out of their music business. I read he got married again. You heard about that? The paparazzi were a nightmare. They expected me to crash the wedding or something. - Did you? - No! I didn't have my getaway driver. One time. I did that one time! What's your excuse? I can't keep driving your skinny, drunk ass around. - I don't live here. - Yet. Maybe. You know what I mean. Yeah. I'm just not sure about moving here. You're not sure about LA or John? You know, I want to go back to work. We have paramedics here, too. No. If I move here, I'll end up in an office. - That sounds terrible. - What, working or the office? Yes. What do you do when you don't have to be a parent all the time anymore? Whatever we want. Paul! - Tough morning. - Yeah. Paul, this is my son, Derek. I saw you on TV today. - Can you sign my book? - Sure. Do you think the two quakes are related? The USGS app shows a lot of activity in the Newport-Inglewood fault. When does it count as a swarm? We're looking into the same thing. We should talk after my lecture. Yeah. We're measuring deep activity near the mantle. The lab is sending the data over now. - Of course. - What does magma... ...have to do with earthquakes and fault line? So, why did you become a scientist? Well, that's a great question. When you're constantly questioning things, you're constantly learning... Excuse me, are you from the news? Guilty as charged. I'm a reporter, John Benson. It's nice to meet you. Hi. Can we...? Yeah, sure. Hey, buddy. How are you? This prehistoric whale skeleton is on loan from the Natural History Museum. Thirty-four to 40 million years ago. It's one of the most intense skeletons... - Get in the picture? - Let's get in. One, two, three. - Great, thanks. - You're welcome. Great. I've tweeted it and tagged the center, so you can find it on their feed. Okay. I'll share it with the news station, maybe we'll get on TV. We'd like that, right? You ever been on TV? It's fun. Your cousin, he's so hot. His voice is liquid panty remover. I can confirm that is not true. Y'all give it up for DJ Twist. Hey! Congrats, your new album is amazing. - Glad you could make it. - This is Dana and Chrissy. - Hi. - Hey, beautiful. Hi. Hey, look. Enjoy the party, have fun. Whatever you need, I'm here. I have to make some rounds. - Okay? - Okay. And that is Marcus, girls. Do you see the drummer from his video anywhere? That kid is amazing. - Brooke! - Jay! - Hey. - Hey. This firecracker is Margot's niece. - Hey. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - Hi, girls. - Can we have a picture? - Yeah, me too. - Absolutely. - Me too. Marcus! Get in here! Marcus, did you drop something today? It's shaking the whole planet. With that being said, I think it's only right I drop that new record again, Let's party y'all! Is this thing on? I could get used to this. You know, Brooke is thinking about not going to college. I never went to college. I did okay. She's young. She's got lots of time to figure it out. My God, there's a fire! What is that? Derek! You've got to stay down. Stay down! Let me go! What is that? Boss, it's on TV! There are reports now of a major explosion out in the Hollywood Hills. In fact, we're getting calls and messages just flooding in to the newsroom. Yeah, we've heard people saying bomb. Yes, actually there was a suggestion earlier today of terrorist attack with a smaller explosion. - That was this morning. - We just don't know yet. We have very little information available. - Bomb. It's happening. - People are calling in... ...saying they've never seen or felt anything like this before. We are getting video into the newsroom. We'll continue to show that to you. Emergency crews are on their way right now for those that need some sort of assistance. We have no reports yet on just how many residents out there may need some sort of medical attention. We have heard that the blast in the hills has destroyed homes and started numerous fires. If you're just joining us, there was a second explosion today here in Los Angeles. We want to stress, though, still no information at this point if two events could be related. Right, we are hoping a statement from authorities. Nothing. We have to go. I'm with Marcus, I'm okay. Just get out of here. Go now! Go, go! Derek! Derek! Brooke! Come here! Marcus! Dad! Dad! Dad! Where is your Mom? - I don't know. - We're going to find her. Jake? Jake! Jake! Thanks. - Derek! - Dad! - Are you okay? - I'm all right. Where is Paul? Sorry, he didn't make it. - We'll keep trying your Mom. - Brooke? Let's just keep moving. All right? Come on. Come on. Let's go. Come on. I got to go back. I gotta go back. I got to save my Dad! He would want you to go. My Mom isn't answering. She always answers. Come on, Marcus. Marcus, come on! It's a volcano. Whoa. Get down! - You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. Let's get out of here. This is the activation-- Where are we going? We're going to get your mother and sister. Did anyone use check in? ...evacuation order for LA county... - Brooke and Marcus are okay. - Where? - ...Bel-Air, Beverly Crest... - They're going to the house. - Keep trying your Mom. - ...Hollywood, Mid-City West... Do you know how to upload those videos? - This is not a test. - Use the station's app. Done. Margot! Margot! Margot! My leg! Easy, easy. Okay. It's all right. You just need some stitches. - We'll get you to the hospital. - Shit! It hurts! I got it. It's going to hurt. Okay. Let's go. - My God! - Let's get you out of here. Come on. My ankle. My God. My God. That was a bomb. - Let's get you out of here. - Okay. Where is your car, Marcus? Are you okay? Where are your keys? Give me your keys! Is it these? Marcus! Marcus, which one? - Here. - Okay. No, I'm driving. - Where does this go? - Press the brake, pull it down! Okay. - Drive straight, go! - Okay! Straight! We have to go west, right? Evacuation order LA County including Beverly Hills, Bel Air, Beverly Crest, Hollywood, Mid-City West, and West Los Angeles. We have to know what's happening. I ditched them. My brother is out there. With my dad. Lucky you. I'm really sorry. They're going to your house. Our moms! Brooke? I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. Sorry for how I've been acting. It's all right. It's okay. Shit! There's a pharmacy not too far. Just keep along this road. Hey, anything? They keep saying try again. No, Margot? No! Hey! I need you to stay awake, okay? You're going into shock. I need you to stay awake. Margot! - Stay with me, okay? - We need an ambulance. No! We're going to take the van! Come on. No! You can lean on me. Let's go! - Stay with me. - Okay. I need you to show me where the hospital is. All right. Dad, have you seen this? Can they do that? Erupt more than once? Some volcanoes never stop. Hey, hey, hey! No, no, no! You got to stay awake, okay, Margot? - Come on. - I should be with-- Let's keep this leg elevated. - You need to tell me. - He's with Brooke. You need to tell me where the closest hospital is. - Brooke. God. - No, Margot! Margot! Stay focused, okay? Where is the closest hospital? Cedars. Cedars Sinai. And where's Cedars Sinai? Do I make a right or left out here? - A right. - Okay. Stay focused. I need you, okay? You need to tell me where to go. - All right? - Okay. Okay! Margot, stay with me! I turn right out here and then where? - What do I do? - Another right. Okay, another right. My God. This is crazy! What was that? What the hell is that? I think it's ash. My God. Dad! We're just fine. It's going to be okay. Look, keep trying your Mom. We gotta get out of here. It's voicemail. Useless. Margot, how is your leg? It's fine. Where is the hospital? So, we're getting close, right? You know what? I'm going to stop here and take a look outside. All right? Hey, come on! You can't go this way! The road is blocked! - You have to turn around! - I'll be right back. Okay. Lady, you can't go any further. - You need medical attention? - No. It's my sister. Someone needs to look at her leg. - Where'd you guys come from? - The Hollywood Hills. Damn. You're lucky to make it this far. It's a volcano. I can't believe it. You'll need to turn back. They set up a triage center at a school on Fairfax. It's just over a mile. - You're tourists. - Boston. Hell of a vacation. You should come with us. You can't breathe this in for very much longer. I just quit smoking. We'll see you there. There are people looking for hospitals. We're going to stay as long as we can. Everything is gonna be fine. You'll be okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. It's gonna be okay. This place doesn't look too safe. We need to stay as low key as possible. Take off any valuables. Stay close to me. You ready? Stay close. We just don't know yet. We have very little information available. People are calling in saying that they've never seen or felt anything like this before. We are getting video in to the newsroom. Getting ready to show that to you. Of course, emergency crews are on their way right now for those that need some sort of assistance. We've been watching some amazing video as they continue to pour in in, more and more footage of a volcano that erupted just hours ago in Los Angeles. It really is amazing. The pool of ash and gas rising almost three miles into the sky and poses a danger to small aircraft. The leading edge of lava flow like the ones you're watching right now, are traveling at about six miles per hour. Once the channel gets established, lava can flow as fast as 40 miles per hour. Can I? Now nearly 150 feet high, the volcano has forced a mandatory evacuation, Will they be okay? with emergency crews on the ground right now in what they are considering priority neighborhoods. The volcano may seem quieter right now, - but it can erupt again-- - We go back. We should evacuate with everyone else. You want to leave? Our families would want us to get out, Brooke. Everybody is wondering how could this happen? My Dad works for that TV station. There's no answer. Thanks anyway. I hope you find them. Videos just like this from all across the city right now. This spectacular footage was just recorded minutes ago by our very own John Benson. - Is that hail? - Gravel stones. In the air. More and more victims of the volcano as it now continues to erupt in LA. Just tragedy after tragedy being captured on cameras all around the city. Where are they? - Where is that? - I don't know. I can't tell. Brooke, we need to find your medicine. Come on. Look, they're going back to the house. - They can't. You saw the map. - No. It's my dad and Derek. They aren't giving up. We can't leave them. They're not going to give up. They're going to the house. I posted that message. I said we were gonna be there. I sent them there! This way. You know the hills are on fire, right? I just don't think they're still there. Don't even say that! Give me your phone. What I mean is most likely they evacuated. La Brea. Derek was reading about that and fossils. There's a triage center at La Brea. Maybe they're there. Maybe they're not. I don't know. No, no, no! My Mom, she would go there. - Let's go. - Okay, okay. Hurry up! Hurry up! Our car has broken down. Can you give us a hand? What do you need, man? Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa! You don't have to do this, man. - Please. - Come on, man. Come on! - Please! - Shut up. Give me your goddamn keys. Stop! Stay down! Marcus! Give me the keys! Let's go! Marcus! The LA County Emergency Operations Center announced an evacuation order for LA county including Beverly Hills, Bel Air, Beverly Crest, Hollywood, New City West, and West Los Angeles. All residents must evacuate immediately. Follow designated evacuation routes. - Officer, where is the detour? - There is no detour. We're evacuating this whole area. - My Mom is in there! - Not anymore. We relocated everyone to the relief center. Yeah, we heard on the emergency broadcast. - Car still running? - So far, yeah. Take advantage of that and get out. But we have to check! My Mom told us to come back here if there's an emergency! You can't keep us away from our homes. I said get back, sir! This whole neighborhood is under a mandatory evacuation order. My dog is at my home! We're dealing with this as best as we can. You're not doing anything! - Get out of my way! - Everybody back up! We're doing the best we can here. They said there's a triage center in La Brea. My daughter works in a hospital. - She must be there! - The best thing you can do... ...is get to your designated evacuation center now. The hills, everyone was sent to La Brea? The triage center is in evacuation as well. What, now? Come on, let's go. Everybody go to their vehicles and evacuate to a safe distance. Go to your vehicles and evacuate a safe distance! You ready? Yeah. Welcome to LA, I guess. Brooke, I swear you hit harder than that guy. I wasn't going to move here. I thought your whole family was coming. Exactly. I applied to college everywhere they weren't going to be. - Anywhere good? - Does it matter? - Did you get in? - Yeah. But I told my mom I wasn't gonna send anything out. She was so mad at me. I told my mom to stay home. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Okay, Margot. We're here. My God. I'll just tighten it a little. It's all right. All right. We're going to move slowly. I'll help you. - I can't. Set me down. - No, no, no! Listen to me. We can't stop now. I can't do this. - Just go. I'll wait here. - And then what? Do this for Marcus. You can do this. I'll help you. Come on. We need some help! Can someone help us? Here! Can't you walk yourself? Let's go in there. Almost there. Okay. All right. You're going to be okay. Cathy, he's choking. Sir? It's okay. You're gonna be fine. - Liv? - John! Thank God. Service is in and out. We don't have long. Where are you? We're going to La Brea. There's a triage station. La Brea? John, that's right next to the damn volcano. I know, but my wife is here somewhere. We've been running your footage all day. The videos are amazing. Derek took them. They're about to evacuate the studio. We'll keep broadcasting from our station in Santa Ana. - You need to get out of there. - Not without Mom and Brooke. Our family is out here somewhere. Call me when you find them. Maybe we can help. Okay. Great, Liv. Thank you. Hi, this is Cathy. I'm busy right now. It's just voicemails? It's okay. Margot, it's going to sting for a little bit. And then it'll feel much better, okay? Here we go. How is that? - What? - Stop! Stop! Hey! Derek, no! Derek, wait a second! Derek, what are you doing? Dad! Dad, he's in the front! Dad! Dad! Derek, get back! - I'm going to save you. - Get back! Hey! Hey! It's gas! Come on! Hold on, buddy. We'll get you out of here. Help me out, Derek! Help me, please. - Help me, please. - Mister? Help me, please. Mister? Thank you. - Thank you. - It's okay. Dad, call 911. Dad. No, Dad! Call 911! It's too late, buddy. He's gone. He's gone, okay? We got to keep moving. - You can't say that. No, Dad. - Come on, son. We can't just keep moving all the time, no! - No! - Derek, listen to me, son. We got to keep moving. Okay? You got to stay strong. All right? Come on. My God. - Careful. - He must be scared. Stay next to me. It's okay. It's okay, girl. Stay next to me. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where'd you come from? Come over here. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. All right? Good girl. Good girl. We used to ride all the time. Mom made me take so many lessons. It's okay. Where did he come from? What's that? We just found her. We weren't trying to-- Don't panic. It's cool. I came out to track him. Are you a survivalist? Yeah, there's nothing worse than being right about the end of the world. Can you help us? Yeah. Whoa. Whoa. We need to go here. - You got a signal? - No. Can you ride? You're doing great. Where are you going after this? Coast. We got a boat all stocked up. We're going to sail straight out the harbor. We? You're welcome to come with us. We got to try to find them. Yeah, I get that. Come on. I don't see anything here from them. Maybe they went out on a truck. Derek! Buddy, don't just walk away like that, man. We got to stay close. You left. Let's run. Let's go. On board, sir. Everyone on the truck. Why don't you get the injured first? We're not. Wait. We just got here. We haven't even looked around. - My Mom might be-- - Evacuation is mandatory. Critically injured first, right? - We're not injured. - Yeah, please. If your family was here, they've already moved to the evac site. We're not going anywhere, okay? My wife may be out here. We're not going to-- - Mom! - Derek? Derek! Where is Brooke? I don't know. - Is Margot okay? - She's here. Her leg-- I did the best I could. She can't walk. Is she going to be okay? Yeah! She's going to be okay. She's just resting. So we have to do something so Brooke can find us. Last chance. Thank you. No problem. I don't know what we would have done-- - If you need anything from us-- - Don't worry about it. Find your people. Thank you. This has been the-- I'm not sure we have... I'm gonna get my phone. Excuse me. Is there a white phone? ...disaster in the shadow of the volcano. No, no. No, that's it. Thank you. Thank you. ...people are now being evacuated. The President, we understand, will be addressing the nation very shortly. Lava continues to advance across L.A. - Did you see her post? - She's out there. Don't worry. We're going to find her. The USGS now is stating the lava is most dangerous when onlookers start approaching the advancing lava and suddenly get cut off by the flow.
