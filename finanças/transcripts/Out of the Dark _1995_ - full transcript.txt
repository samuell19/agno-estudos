Mother, I'll burn paper money for you. Rest in peace. Almost time to throw things down. He's done it 3 nights this week. Whoever runs away first pays double. Enough. The one who runs away first pays double. Those people are inconsiderate. Why throw things out from such a height? Aren't we wasting time waiting for them to throw things? Xiao Long, tonight's the first week since Madam's death. Burn some incense for her. There's no elevator tonight. It's exhausting to climb up the stairs. What are you doing here? There's hardly any spaceto walk here. She's putting on a show. What use is all this ritualif you were not filial? Right. If she were truly filial, she shouldn't ask old peopleto run errands at night. They might dieand nobody would know. Madam Zhang, who are you referring to? Mr. Li. If I did anything to offend you while you were alive, I hope you would show mercy and forgive us. Open the door, quick! Sister, open up!I have to get something! Mom, sister didn't openthe door again! Open up!You want to die? You've locked yourself upthis week and also the last. My sister is lovelorn again. I hear something. It's getting nearer. I can't stand it any longer! You must. Don't let that old guy laugh at you. Who are you calling "old guy"? You lazy bones! The housing departmentwill soon come for a check. Throw it over there this time. Mr. Hu. - Where's Ah Lu?- Over there. Add more men?Wouldn't that cost money? - Let me think about it. - But the few of us-- Mr. Lu, could you lend mesome money? Go to hell! - Mr. Lu. - Bastard! Ah Jiang, give this letter to my husband. I want to part with him. - Madam--- Brother Jiang. . . The novelty shop in the mallcloses at ten. They usually deposit the moneyin the bank the next day. Let's go and steal ittomorrow night. No, the florist next dooris better. Why? The girl there has a big bosom. Rape her. You are so useless. Let's do it tomorrow night. Then we rape her afterwards. After the heist, you'll have money. Then you could get a hooker. Come on. Have some principles in life, okay? We'll rape herafter we've had fun with the hooker. What's up? Last week, an old woman died here. This week, would there be. . . You chicken. We're upright. What have we to fear? Come on. Check the tenth floor. Crush me. Come on. You are being lazy again. Why are you lying there? My wife has left mefor someone else. Get up. Don't block the way. Let me die! Then go smash your brainsagainst the wall. Are you nuts?You'd take my chance to die? There's no prize for it. Who has thrownthe fridge down? Captain, Xiao Longhas disappeared! Don't panic. He might be out playingand will return soon. No, he's disappearedfor an hour. I even picked up his watchin the elevator. Watch? Must have bumped intoa sex maniac. Are you nuts? He is a boy!Why would a sex maniac want him? Sodomy. You want to die? Get lost with your bullshit! If not sodomy, then the reason must be ransom. Shut your mouth! I'll kill you! Alright. Let me. You bastard, what are you talking about? Sleep here awhile. Mr. Li, let's go upstairsand call the police. Okay. Captain, please. Don't fret. The police have been notified. They'll find your son in no time. His dad is a humble chefwith a meager salary. He isn't rich. So why kidnap Xiao Long? Mr. Li, what's the matter? My mother was here. You must be kidding. Look. The chicken leg is gone. My mother must have eaten it. Are you so sure? She used to love itwhen she was alive, and ate it sitting in this chair, like you. Could she have returnedto look for me? Don't be like this. Cool it. I'll get you some water. Your mother's hiding there, having a drumstick! What is it? Mom. Xiao Long? It's late. Where are you going? Pung! I will forget Johnnyfrom this minute on. God, give me a new start. Alright, I promise you. Didn't I promise you?Speak. Okay. Speak. Again. It's twelve. Have a sip. No?Forget it, then. Stay calm. It's not your first time. What? It's my duty to execute justicefor the heavens. Right?If I don't do it, who would? Don't worry about me. It's time. Sorry. Next time, if your sonwants to have a chicken leg, tell him not to eatin shady areas. He'll scare people to death. Sure. Sorry. Thank you, Captain. Take care. Tonight, let's take Xiao Longto the hotel. Pack up. I'll call and book a room. Could you tell methe telephone number for Good View Hotel? - Xiao Long!- What hotel? What is it? Xiao Longhas disappeared again. Xiao Long! Wait here. I'll go and look. I'll go with you. Stay home. Hello? Has Xiao Long returned? No. I'll return at once with captain Lu. Mom! Xiao Long! Want to get away? You are a beast. You killed me. I'll kill you! You can't escape. Xiao Long. What are you doing here? He's possessed! - Wife!- Husband! - What's the matter?- Xiao Long is possessed. Who was that just now? He got rid of Xiao Longwith a loudspeaker. What's going on? It's your mom. If she doesn't die even whenapplied with high voltage, then cockroachwill rule the world. You like to scare people. It's wrong. Did you know that? Yes. Then call home and say "sorry. " Really? Yes. Hello? I'm your mother. They all ran off scared. Your voice is too sickening. Must you sound so spooky? Never mind. I'm a ghost anyway. So what's the big deal?Must you be so arrogant? I'm not. They killed me, and I want revenge today! Let's speak over there. Cool! Mom. Grandma. Did I offend you? You want to compete with meto die first? Who is it? - Security captain?- Yes. I am Leo. Leo. Your hands have electricity. - Are you frightened?- You aren't frightened? Frightened? That ghostshould have left the kid but is still in this building. - Right. - Captain. - Is there a 7-Eleven around here?- Little Seven? - 7-Eleven. - 7-Eleven? Yes. Get a bottle of conditioneron the way back. - What for?- Your hair is in bad condition. - It's time to nourish it. - What are you talking about? Ghosts detestseeing someone all spruced up. So adding highlights to your hair is a good reason for doing so. Give me 500 dollars. Here you go. Thanks. What's the money for?For the ghost? No, I have no money for a taxi. You are not making sense. Are you nuts? Yes, he's mentally handicapped! This bastard sneaks awayevery time I sleep! Bring him back! Go! I'm not going back! We get on well. Let's chatback at the mental institution. Come on! No! Let me go! Is there anyonethis brave nowadays? Do you know where he lives? Zhong Guang Mental Hospital. I'll look for him after work. Ah Qun, even if you lose Johnny, you needn't look for a nutcase. He's no nutcase. He's, in fact, a visionaryliving in a mental hospital. You think I don't know? "Zhong Guang Mental Hospital" Who are you looking for?Visiting hours are over. - Robbery!- What's the matter? Besides his passionfor the arts, Vincent van Goghwas a religious fanatic. He would rather go hungrythan part with all his money. Einstein's theory on relativityinfluenced many of our successfulscientific theories, such as F equals maare not correct. Steven Spielberg called melast evening, asking how the Jurassic Park sequelshould be filmed. Looking for me? Yes. Let me ask you, do you believe in flying saucers? - Or the Loch Ness Monster?- I do. We can talk then. I am Leo. Ah Qun. - Yesterday you were quite--- Bold. How come you'vebeen locked up here? Because I fear nothing, and that's precisely the reasonwhy people think I'm nuts. - I lost something. - What? Something important. How come you fear nothing? Are you afraid? It's a fake. Are you afraid if it's real? That's right. You're afraid because you don't believe the gun is real. Anything can happen in this world. Why? Because you have no imagination. Einstein once said, "Imagination is more important than knowledge. Imagination can make the impossible possible. " Are you afraid? Alright. I tell you, I saw a flying saucer when I was a kid. That is what peoplecall a UFO now. UFO. Do you understand? When I was four, I saw the Loch Ness Monster, and I chatted with the yeti of the Himalayas. Also, I have been playing roller coaster every morning since I wasa kid, and then I play with pirate ships in the afternoon. I've even played bothin the morning and afternoon, then played pirate shipsagain in the evening. Let me tell you this, I always say to young people, "Don't try to accomplish everythingin the short term. " My success is the result of many trials. I have seen terrible things, even the weirdest things. What could be frighteningto me? Then is our housereally haunted? Yes. I knew it already. - How? - Lily told me. - Who's she? - This pot of flowers. It's shocking! There's an even more shocking matter which will happen in yourhouse. I'll get it resolved right now. He's asleep. Don't wake him. Are you done? Not yet. Do you two understand what I am talking about? I need more men, but I don't understand why Mr. Wu has sent you both. I don't speak Fukienese. You two don't understand Mandarin. There's no communication at all. It's your first night at work tonight. Go and make the rounds from upstairs to downstairs. We'll meet in the office in an hour. What did he say? Did he tell us we can get off work now? Can we go home now? Yes. One hour. - Great. - We're off. You two finally follow what I am saying? Go on. Okay. Great. Getting off work so early. I might bump into a ghost anytime. Damn. Anyone coming upto accompany me down? Tieh Dan? It's late. Why are you so loud? Sorry. May I use your phone? Damn you. Use the one in your office. Ghosts, excuse me. I am just passing through. Captain Lu, help me. Madam Li, I am not responsible for your death. Don't harm me. I only want your help. How could I help you? Since you are willing, I'll come out and talk to you. Please don't! Just stay on one side and talk to me! Alright, then. First of all, lend me forty dollars. What do you want that for? I need dope. You need dope? Ah Ming! Captain Lu. Damn kid!You stealing again? - I'll kill you! - I haven't stolen. Damn it. Captain Lu, help me. Still one left. Why are you not going? Damn, are you going or not? How come it fell off so easily? Not your fault. Don't be afraid. A ghost! I haven't done anything wrong. Don't hurt me. I have only been a Peeping Toma few times. Captain Lu, if I wanted to hurt you, I would have done so last night when I was seeking revengeon my son and his wife. You came looking for revenge? They killed me and are sure to suffer for it. Please reconnect my head. I'll tell you the whole story. Reconnect your headto your body? Thanks for the trouble. You're welcome. Sorry. I didn't meanto poke at your nostrils. So tell me the whole thing. I'll report it to the policeand avenge you. Thanks, captain Lu. Why are you standing here? Just helping to reconnectyour mother's head. You want to call the police? Stop drinking. I've arranged a date for you. Be careful. Come. Go to the washroom quickly. You're my good brother. How come she ain't here yet? I'll call her. We're rich this time. - Take care of it for me. -Captain! I'll kill you! Don't run! Why did you hack him? You bitch! Why have you snatched my money? Did you think I wouldn't recognize you? Stop! Stop! Don't fight with me over a girl! Wait for me! What's wrong with you, woman? I told you to stop! If you keep that up, I'll leap on you. I'll pay you for the whole service. Come on. Quick, look! What do you want now? Where's your head? Turn back. - Impossible!- What's the matter? - Lost your money, right?- Yes. Damn you! - Yes, I am a dead man's skull. -Ghost! Help!Someone stabbed me upstairs. Don't go up! No way out. I'm dead! Damn!Go to the middle floor. You're bleeding. I'll take you to the hospital. Captain, thanks. I'm very grateful. It's okay. Anyone would do it. A kind deed is for oneself, too. Captain, you're using me as a shield. Please put me down. No. You've been hurt badly. I'll take you to the hospital. Thanks. Who can take me to the hospital? Don't. Jump! Go on! Don't! Jump, do you hear? You killed your motherand want to kill us, too! Jump! Shut up! Let's do it! No. Killing your motheris no big deal. If you want to, you could kill mine, too. I am not as despicable as you. Actually, I didn't mean to kill my mother. She was quarreling with Ah Yun the other day, and I was aboutto separate them, but accidentally pushed heronto the freezer. I didn't kill my motheron purpose. - Jump!- Go on! What's happening here? Don't move! It's not him. It should be those two with the knives. Sorry. Don't move! Husband! Oh, honey! You killed my husband. I told him not to move. Everyone heard that. It's not my fault. It's not your fault? I'll die with him, and you'll pay in blood. You needn't get dressed in red. Do you want to end upas a poltergeist? Alright. Wait. There's no alternative. Die now. Could I buy you a drink? An eye for an eye. I'll shoot her. I'll become a poltergeistand kill you all! Could I compensate youwith money? How much? Depending on whateveris agreeable to you. Got her. She couldn't die just like this. I can't let her die like this. You can't die like this. Wake up! Everyone knows she is dead. Save your effort and help me. He's dying. Quick. Wake up! Would he kill us all, too? Call the police. Are you done? Could she resurrectafter that beating? Why did you save me? We could talk this through. You needn't come back to haunt us. My husband is dead! Look what I've become. I'll die with him. Let's see how you can save me! Get a pack of ice from 7-Eleven. - What for?- Just go quickly. Do we need transportation? - Luckily, she didn't shoot the head. - Could she be saved? Don't know. Give her a blood transfusion first. There's no blood here. There's blood all over his face. Carry him here. You're nuts. Please, come and help. - Kid, what do you want? - Don't move. What's your blood type? - AB. - AB? She belongs to the B type. Why didn't you say so? Blood transfusion is only possiblebetween the same type. Do you haveany medical knowledge? Here's the ice. Put it on the wound. Please leave some for me. I have bled a lot, too. Give me a hand. Grab her hand. You two, come here. Where are you going? Please do a good deedand kill me. I don't want to suffer anymore. Why did you save me? I now know what it meansto live a living death. You might hit her headwith the gun. You might have another way. Those I've killedcould never be saved. The night when the soul returnswill be a bloody night. Many a life will be destroyed. Call the policeif there's any problem. I know. Excuse me. Sorry. Why did the Lisjump to their death? That's the point. It's okay. Go back to sleep. What about the kid? You bastards. One going to find a prostitutewhile at work, another onepimping a whore for the other. You two are even worse. Stealing things! Do you know what would happenif you're caught? And there's the incidentof the ghost in the building. Mr. Wu said not to leak it out. Are you clear? Master, what's to be done now? I have sent the old lady's soulback to hell. How? Didn't you hear me flushing? At my age, I didn't expect to have relationswith an 80-year-old hag. Come on. Treat it as a relief. Stop your bullshit. She mademy private parts swollen. I feel numb. Really numb. He's pissing. See, I didn't even realize that. I'm certainly dead. What's to be done? Don't panic. I think we are all hungry. Let's eat first. - What would you like?- Fruits. Ah Jiang, get him some fruits. What kind? Steamed orangewith black salted beans, and green chili and tofu sauce. Slightly spicy. Good morning. This is the first lesson. Let's define the meaning of fear. To understand different kindsof fear is simple. Who dares to kiss him? I do. She's really ugly. I can't do it. Sorry. It's okay. You've looked at me for so long. You're marvelous. Training should bea gradual process. Why should we startat a high level of difficulty? Right. Let's try something else. There's a pile of shitin my hands. Who dares to comeand touch it? There are many choices. Why pick something so disgusting? Why not? You're saying becauseyou have enjoyed tertiary education and have come fromthe upper segment of society, you feel something like fecesis meaningless and disgusting? Similarly, you've been toldby your mom as a kid that ghosts are horrifying. Even if shit doesn't stink, you'd still detest it. And if a ghost leaves you alone, you'd still be frightened. If you could think otherwise, that would be good. Come and touch it, if you dare. I have. What have I experienced? I don't feelI have learned anything. How about this? You should learn well. This gentleman fails to relinquish traditional values. That's why he's so scared. Black magic. Even if you knewit would take some time before it explodes, you would be scared to hold it. Even the bravest man, if he were to hold on to it, would be scared to death. But I am not scared. I mistakenly grabbeda short-fused firecracker. But I didn't shed a tear. Now you all know I am gutsy. Let's continue. The doc said only a row of my teethhas been damaged. I was lucky. But, in a jiffy, if there's another accident, and consideringmy injury is serious, I might not be ableto continue to teach you all. That's why I will elevate the training. What you'll receive now is the Russian wayto train your courage. After I light the fuse, pass it down. See who is the unlucky one. - I don't want to be like him. - Stay calm. Sorry. Too much pressure. I give up. I risk my life to train you. Who dares leave? Sit. Quick. Give it to me. Hurry. Experiencing fear already? It's going to explode. Catch. Not so fast. - That's the way it should be. - Wait. - Your turn. Come on. - I have to look for something. Wait. - Take it. - Wait, I said. Yours. Yours now. Toss it to me! You devil, you have your helmetand bulletproof vest on. You screwed me! A ghost is an energy force that's always present in the world. If it died unjustly, its energy field is even greater. That's why they could influenceour visual nerves and cause hallucinations. The ghost of Mrs. Liwas one such example. If the influence of the energy affects our brain and, motor nerves, we call it possession. That's the case with the Lis. But that is rare. Rather, it is common for ghoststo be everywhere, but without affecting us. There's one over there right now. And one on the ceiling. Another at my back. Pal, just listen. And don't rest your handon my shoulder. Thanks. I can't stand any excitementas I am injured. Teach us how to catch a ghost. Shrink-wrap plastic to catch themand chocolate to beat them. Shrink-wrap plasticcontains sulfuric acid and could seal inthe ghost's energy particles. Chocolate contains milk, and ghosts are afraid of cows. That's why cow devils who serve the king of Hades are, abundant. What's with you? There's a reaction. I'll teach you something else. This is a cow's tear. Just rub it lightly on the eyelids, and one could see, spirits. Where are they? I told you rub faster. They're all gone now. Damn it. He cheated us. Beat him up. Wait! Ghost. There's one wearing a red dressand with long hair. See it? Don't run! Halt! What do we do? Give it another chance!Get her! Get her! You have to pay for the damages. The one in the red dress!Get her! Where's my purse? Sir, you're sitting on my wallet. Excuse me, please. I have been dead for many years. You are the first one to see me. Let's be friends. There really are ghosts. Bitch, taking drugs in broad daylight! What are you doing?Help! Robbery! Robbery? Check her. She has a pulse. Can't be a ghost. Nuts. You shouldn't take her pulse. Listen for the heartbeat. There indeed is a heartbeat. I don't believe it. There really is. I don't believe it either. Impossible. Go away. My turn. What are you doing?Go away. I'm not done yet. We checked her heartbeat. What's next? - Check something else. - Alright. Don't move! Police! - I'll cut him into pieces. - Stay calm. He told us to rub cows' tears and made us look like monkeys', asses! What nonsense! Ah Qun, where's that nutcase? Upstairs. You bastard, still swinging up there! Are you peeing?Come down! Right. I want to introducethis flying machine I have inventedwith much effort over the years. The ghost I saw in a red dressthis morning, I am sureshe was looking for vengeance. But when I chased her, she was gone in a wink. So I feel if we could fly, and with the sensitivityof this pot of flowers, it'd be easier to catch a ghost. He said if one puts it onand faces the air, one can fly. Fly. Stop fooling around. What happened this morninghas driven them crazy. - What's on your mind?- Play with them one more time. Don't. They wantto kill you right now. They are all very angry now. Not to mention, I want to kill you, too. Don't you get it? Try to seeif you can fly out of here. I am still tryingto protect you, even thoughI know that you are nuts. I just hope you can becomea useful person one day. But now you ask me to fly from here?What rubbish is that? Go ahead and fly out from here, if you trust me. How dare you hit my brother! Give me the chain! Crazy! I'm going to kill you! Come on. I'm invincible. Who dares to call me a fake? Come and try to stab me. Stop playing the fool. I've never been afraid of you. I'll kill you any wayand any time I want. I'll cut your heart out. What are you laughing at? Let me tell you, I am not scared of anything. I must kill you today. Shut up. Stop talking nonsense with him. Hold out your hand. Hold out the other one. Your head, too. If I don't strike this blow, my whole family will die. If I kill you, I would have to go to jail. I won't be that stupid. Stab me. Let me cheer you on. Come and stab me. Hurry. Stab me. Damn! Yes!I don't dare kill you! I don't dare kill you. You have to compensate mea total of $36. 80. Alright. Calm down. Let me. Forget it. I trust you. I really have seen a ghostthis morning. He didn't lie to us. Wait. One more victim is here. Don't know wherethis piece of iron came from. If not for this railing, I could have avoided it. I won't let her go outafter what she has done. May the God of Chivalryprotect us. Captain, you are wrong. How could you believewhat that crazy man said? Although he is crazy, you all saw it, too. Mrs. Li's spirit came back7 days after her death. So what? Stop squabbling. Today, two will go in a group. Big cat will do his rounds with me. Tieh Dan will go with youto the shopping arcade. Ah Jiang and Xiao Mengwill patrol the corridor of the arcadeand the cargo elevator. - What about me?- You stay at the office. What about the two of us? To the elevators! Go! Captain, do you thinkthose two non-locals would take French leave? - Let me ask them. - How? What's happening over there?Tell me. That's all I know. Why are they laughing? That means it's alright. You have a strange wayof communicating. Yes. Let's go. Go to the back. Alright. I'm going. Ghost! Help! Help! Ghost! Beard! Captain Lu. Captain Lu. Must have gone on patrol. The wallet is gone. You talk too much. - Damn!- What? Beard's dead! - What did he say?- I just could understand a little bit. - Never mind him. - Wait! What is it? Blood. It's blood. - You're frozen?- You want to quit? - Wait. - What is it? He said he's got a sore throat. Can't you give him a lozenge? I've finished them all. Don't go. How dare you play deadon the floor and not go to work! He's like you, sleeping around. What do you mean?It's because of your bad leadership. How dare you talk to me like that? Stop it. - Come. Open the door. - Go away. It's a woman's voice. Ah Jiang wants a prostitute? Sounds like Ah Qun. Ah Qun has become a prostitute? Damn it. - Go. - You go. Go! So big! He's come back for revenge! It's not our fault. What's happening? It's all an illusion. Unplug it, and everything will be fine. Check out Ah Jiang. Ah Jiang. - What's going on?- Are you alright? You crazy man, why did you come back again? Ah Jiang! Someone's dead! No, he's come back to save us. Leo! Is this your appendix? Yes. Did I cut it off? That's right. That's great. Even the doctorpraises you for your, skill. You all know that I am invincible. But all of a sudden, I've got appendicitis. That made melose concentration. At the same time, Ah Qun stabbed me. When I stabbed youwith a knife, it so happened thatI cut off your inflamed appendix? Yeah. Great! I am really great! Then you don't evenneed a doctor. There was a hole in your belly. So all you have to do is take a pair of chopsticksand take it out. Wrong. Doctors don't use chopsticks, they use pincers. That's right. The doc just sewed you up. So you can just walk outas if nothing has happened. You're wrong. I sneaked outin a hurry to come here. So I sewed it up myself. You did? What about your bad tooth?Did you just knock it off with a hammer? You are wrong again. Everyone would think of a hammer. Instead, I used an ironto smooth it out. Don't always say I am wrong. I know that you have made upall these stories. Try to guess it correctly for once. Let me be correctfor once, alright? Let me save face, alright? Of course, I should try to save your face. But there are times when you will lose it yourself. Ah Jiang and Ah Chang's deaths were caused by some kind, of power which disturbed their brain waves and caused them to hallucinate. Did you notice thatthey did not have any injuries? They were, in fact, frightened to death. That's why I've always told youto have strong faith, but you don't listen. Take the appendix caseas an example. When Ah Qunstabbed me with a knife, if it wasn't for my appendicitis-- Isn't the bladderbelow the appendix? Wrong. The bladder is here, the appendix over here. You shut up! I don't want to hearabout your appendix again. Stop it. That's enough! Dear audience, ghosts will appear at twelve. I'll give you allsome psychological counseling here. You still wantto hear this madman talk? What do you mean?What do you want? Get out of the way. Why did you have to mentionmy appendix? You nutcase! You bunch of trash, there aren't any ghosts. There's a ghost at twelve?I am the ghost! You're all crazy. You guys accompany himto catch the ghost. I am going home to take a bath!I quit! I knew you'd return. Sorry for what I've said. Sorry. Won a prize? Yes. The ghosts of the Lisare outside. They were gone in a wink. Then? Then I came back quickly. Tell me as soon as you knowof anything in the future. - It's a deal. - Brother, forever at your service. You're my leader. My life is in your hands, from today on. Very good boy. Thanks. Have a smoke first. Forget it. From now on, everything you see is imaginary. Don't let it distract you. Just focus, and no ghost can harm you. Careful. Switch it off. Sorry. I wanted some suitable music to create the right atmosphere. Switch it off! I did. It turned on by itself. I had nothing to do with it. Let me first. I am in more of a hurry. Me first! Me first! I can't hold it! Stay calmas if nothing has happened. Just act normal. I am okay. Just need to pee. What's the big deal?I have seen it all. I'm going to drink some water. All is imaginary. I must overcome it. Help me lock it up. Want to scare me?Not that easy. Oh, I haven't wiped my ass. Hello? I died horribly. What's up?Speak slowly. I am hereto seek revenge from you. What are you saying?I can't make it out. This is so exaggerated. Dying is no big deal. It's just water. Pretend it's nothing Rub the face Feels much better. I am a real ghost. I really don't knowwhat you're saying. I want revenge. What are you talking about? What?So embarrassing. I have managedto conquer the mirage at last! Follow the beat. What beat? The beat of the music. What's a beat?Let me see. See the beat? This is also a beat. - Follow my beat. - I want to follow my own beat. Stop arguing. None of your business!Shut up! Are you followingmy beat or not? Stop nagging. I have never followed it, and don't intend to. You really won't? Yes. So? You want to know? Why are you so fierce? You don't understand. I must be fierce. You take me for a fool? Don't let her go!Get her! I almost forgot. There's one more. Captain Lu, please don't. You've got the wrong person. Ghostbuster, I'll kill you first. Your turn. Go. Quick. What are you looking at? Go! Kid, don't run! Let's cut it off! Strangled by a ghost, bleeding, and you're still alive! Strangled and bleeding to death are two different things. Don't get them mixed up. Are you alright? - Yes. And you?- I'm okay. What's up? My flowers! Oh, totally forgot! I'll go back and get, them. You just used the axto hack her. It's for ghostsand won't harm humans. You were possessed. Why didn't I know that? I really don't know anything. It's because you are not determinedenough, so the ghost, possessed you. You must have a strong willand not move an inch. Right. Give me the axe first. Bring it here. Alright. You come get it. Thank you. You're welcome. Damn you! A mousetrap! You didn't think of that? - Ready?- Ready! It hurts. What is it? A mousetrap. It saved you. I've got it. Okay, you go that way. I'll go this way. - Go!- Yes. I won't wear anything next time.
