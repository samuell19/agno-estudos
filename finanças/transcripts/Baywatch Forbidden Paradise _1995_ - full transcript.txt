You wanna spend the entire weekend watching it, right? -I don't wanna just watch it, I wanna try to qualify for it. -Logan, you know, those aren't just waves. They are five story walls of water crashing down. -The fierce part of the draw. -Mitch: I have directions to this remote island where the water is crystal clear. Coral reefs, exotic fish. -Don't tell me it's poisonous. -It's poisonous. -Mitch: Well, we passed that fishing village on the other side of the island. I'm sure they got a radio or call a helicopter, home free. -Matt! -Yeah, oh yeah. -Carlton, you're too close to the edge. -Oh my god! -Narrator: And now, the conclusion. -Holly: Help! Help! Over here! Hurry! -What's wrong? -I was here with my photographer. He was taking pictures of me. One minute he was there and the next, he was gone. A huge wave came and swept him off the cliff. -Rusty, go to headquarters and get back up. -Hurry, please! -What's his name? -Carlton. -Carlton! Carlton! Carlton! -Holly: Do you see him? -Holly! Ah! Help! -That's him. He's alive! Where is he? -He's trapped in a cave. -Carlton: Somebody help me! Help! Holly! Holly! Holly! Somebody help me! Holly! Holly! -Looks like we got trouble. -Stephanie: Yeah. -Let's go check it out. Come on. -We have a victim trapped in a cave beneath the ledge. -Have you tried to coax him out? -He's too scared, he won't budge. -It's gonna be dark soon and we can't wait. We're gonna have to go in after him. -Be careful! -You're gonna have to help. We got no time to lose. We have to get to him right away. -Just tell me what to do. -I want you to get on the back of my wave runner and hang on, just like we practiced, okay? -Okay. Okay. -Carlton: Holly! Holly! Somebody help me! Help! Somebody! Help! Please! Please, somebody help me! -Hang on and stay low. -Stephanie: All right. -Carlton: Somebody help me! Help! Help! Help! Somebody! Help! Help! Somebody help! Oh, thank god! Oh my god! -Take it easy, take it easy. We're gonna get you out of here, but you're going to have to help US. -What do you want me to do? -I want you to get on the back of the sled with Stephanie. I want you to hold your breath and hang on. Can you do that? -I can't hold my breath very long. -I'll be there. I won't let ya you go. -You promise? -Stephanie: I promise. -Okay, let's do it. -I'm scared! -Just hang on, okay? -Get ready. Here we go. -Easy. -You guys, is he gonna be okay? -He'll be okay, but we gotta get him check out at the hospital. -I lost everything, man. I lost my camera, my films, I've lost everything! -No, you haven't, Carlton. You still have your life. -Easy. -Don't worry, Carlton. You're gonna be fine. -You did great out there, Steph. You're a real pro. -I had one heck of a teacher. -He's burning up with fever. -I know. We gotta get him to a hospital. -There's no time. Get him to maihalik, now. Come on. [Speaking in foreign language] -[Speaking if foreign language] Let them pass. -You do not know what you are doing, kona. -Kona. [Speaking in foreign language] [Speaking in foreign language] -Tell me what happened to your friend. -He was stung by a scorpion. -What are you doing? -This poultice will draw out the poison and this herb tea will reduce the fever. -Do you--do you have any means of communication? A radio or anything? -No, nothing. -Look, uh, I think we gotta get him to a hospital. -Please, I know what I'm doing. Keeping him conscious the way you did saved his life. All he needs right now is some rest. So do you. What are you doing here? Not many people come to this island. -We're from Los Angeles. We're la county lifeguards. We're [chuckles], we're here on vacation. What are you doing out here in the middle of nowhere? -If you give me your clothes, I will dry them for you. Just leave them outside the hale. -Wait a minute, wait a minute! Uh, I don't even know your name. What's your name? -It's Lea. -Mitch: Lea. I'm Mitch and this is Matt. Thank you. -He'll be okay. -Carlton. -Wait a minute! -It's just US. How's the cliff diver today? -I'm doing great. Thanks to you guys, I'm alive. -You're a lucky man, you know that? -Lucky? I'd have to laugh, Mark. I mean, for the last past year, I've had more bad luck than 10 people should have in a lifetime. And yesterday, I almost died. Look, I don't mean to sound ungrateful, you guys. It's just that, I don't know, every time I turn around, i'm, I'm like having these little incidents. Do you see, do you see? Do you see? -Well, maybe this is, you know, maybe your streak has been broken and you'll come into some good luck. -Oh, yeah right. Fat chance. Ow! -What's that? -That's my good luck charm. Too bad it doesn't work, huh? -You bet it doesn't work. That's a piece of lava rock. Where'd you get it? -I got it here in Hawaii. -Man, didn't you read any visitor's guides? You're not suppose to take lava rock from Hawaii. It's bad luck. And from what you've described, you're living proof. When did you get this? -I got it last year, December. I took it home for a souvenir. -And didn't you say your bad luck started a year ago? -Yes, it did! -What are you saying, Mark? -I'm saying Carlton's gotta put that rock back where he got it, fast. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Are you saying that this isn't me? This whole thing hasn't been me? That is great! That is so good! Oh, no, no, that is bad! That is really, really bad! They're releasing me today. I can't put this back. You guys, please. You're my only chance. You guys got to put this back for me. Here, you put it back. -You've got to put it back by yourself. -No, no, please. You guys put it back. -I'm not taking it. -Carlton: Oh, come on, please. You guys are lifeguards, right? -Yeah. -Okay, well, then guard my life. Just until I put it back. Oh, please. Please, please, please, please, please. -You look great out there. -Oh, thanks. Tell you what, it feels great out there. Thanks for being so understanding. -You know, I've decided it doesn't matter what we're doing, as long as we do it together. -But you don't mind hanging here instead of sightseeing? -Sightseeing? Hey, I got all the sights I need to see right here. -Woo. I like the sound of that. -Excuse me. Logan Fowler? -Yes? -I understand you're in the surfing competition. -Yeah, that's right. -You're just what we've been looking for. We'd like to shoot a few pictures of you, put it on the cover of our international calendar. -You're kidding. -And it'd make you the, the hot surfer of the 90s. How does that sound? -Sounds great! -Girls. -Oh. -Hi. -Girl: Hey. -Girl: Hi. -Girl: Hey, Logan. -Girl: Hi. -Logan, these are the Hawaiian tropic international models you'll be working with. -Logan: Hey. -What do you think? -Morning. Thanks for the wake up call. Ooh. -Nice pigs, huh? -Hey, Mitch! -Buddy. -Figure I die and went to heaven, bud. -You okay? I mean, uh, I mean, you're okay! -Matt: Yeah. -You're okay! I don't believe this! -That's because you're not a believer in holistic medicine. -Well, I wasn't. I mean, I'm not. I mean, no, i, I, I am now. -You must be starved. -Yeah. I'm famished. -Oh. Try the poi. -Mitch: Okay. Lea, what are you doing out here, anyway? -Matt: Yeah. It seems like you've been out here for a long time. -I lived here for the past 12 years. -12 years? -Since I was a child. -Why? -My parents sailboat sank off the island in a storm. I almost drowned. Kona rescued me, but he couldn't save my parents. -What are kona and the other people doing here in the first place? -Here they feel they can live off the land like the old Hawaiians and be proud. -But why do you stay here, Lea? -I have no choice. -What do you mean? -Lea! Come with me. Now. -Hey, let go of her! -Hey, what's going on here? -It's all right. Please. -That's the kind of guy you wanna write home about, huh? -Carlton. Carlton. Carlton. I though you'd be anxious to get going. -Stephanie, Mark was right. He was right. She's furious with me! -Who is? -Carlton: Madame pele. -Who is madame pele? -The volcano goddess of Hawaii. Come here, look. It says right here in this book, if you take anything from her land, she'll spew her gut. You have all this bad luck and everything. It's not just me, Steph, look. There are scads of bad luck stories in here. -Then we should get the rock back, right away. -What are you, crazy? I'm not leaving this bench! What if something bad happens to me on the way there? -Carlton, you have to put the rock back yourself, remember? Besides, I'm your own personal lifeguard. -Okay, okay, okay. -Come on. -Carlton: Where's Mark? -Mark got called away on an emergency. It's just you and me. -An emergency? Oh, see, see, you see there? My bad luck has rubbed off on him! I'm a dead man. I am a dead man! I'm not leaving this bench! -No, no, no. Mark is fine. And you're gonna be fine, too, okay? So come on. -I'm gonna be fine? -Stephanie: Yes. Just believe me. -I'm gonna be fine? -Stephanie: Yes. -I'm gonna be fine? -Yes, you're gonna be fine. -Okay, I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine. -Four! -Carlton! Carlton, watch out! -Stephanie: Carlton, are you okay? -Oh! -Carlton. Carlton. -What, what. -Are you okay? -Carlton: Yeah. -Are you okay? I'm okay. I'm okay. -Stephanie, I think maybe we should get him to a doctor. -No, no, no, no, no, no, no doctor. Look, I've gotta get this lava rock back before there's nothing left of me. -Okay. -Carlton: Just help me up. -But once you pass the river, you can see the fishing village. From there, you can get a boat to the north shore. But stick with the map. If you don't, you could walk in circles. -Okay. We'll be careful. Thank you for all your help. -Anytime. -Where's Lea? -Mitch, I haven't seen her this morning. -Okay, well, please let her know that we say goodbye and thank her for saving my life. I'm never gonna forget her. -I will as soon as I see her. -Great. Thank you. -Take care of yourself. -Mitch: Bye. -Aloha. -Well, it shouldn't be too difficult, huh? -Let me see it. -A little mountain here. A little stream. We crossed that stream earlier, remember? Over here. -Bye. -Aloha, Mitch. Take care of yourself. -Aloha. -Bye bye. See you later. -Bye bye. -Take care. -Stop, stop, stop, stop! This is it! That's the place right there! -Carlton, you've said this three times. -I know, but that it, I swear. That's the place, man! -Yeah. I've heard that three time before, too. -Oh, no! -Are you okay? -What happened? -Oh, no, don't move, don't move! I dropped the lava rock. Oh god, please. Just let me find that rock. I will never ask to be taller again, I swear to god! I mean, I swear. -Carlton, we'll find it, okay? We'll find it. -Okay, okay. Stephanie, Stephanie, this is my life. Man, I've gotta find that rock. -Carlton, you'll be all right, okay? We'll find it. -Carlton: Oh god, please, please, just let me find this rock! -Hey, you guys, I've got it! -You've got it! Oh god, thank you! Let me have it! Thank you! -Holly, you stay here, okay, because the currents are pretty strong. Carlton, we have to go out there. -Yeah, but it's a lot further than it was before. -Carlton, you have to put the rock back. -You'll be fine. -I'll be back. I'll be back for you. -Come on. -Carlton: Okay. -Be careful. -Carlton, come on. -Bye. -Carlton! -I got you. -Carlton: Okay. This is the place. -Put it back. -Okay. Kiss for good luck. Oh god, please.

Very great, very nice. Looking right in the camera. Good, beautiful, excellent. Good, big smiles. Tighten it up. -Caroline, wait! -I am very tired of waiting and I'm really tired of sharing you. You know, first it was the surfing competition. And now, it's these--these girls. It's very obvious to me, that even on vacation, you don't have time for me. You just don't care enough about me. -Cameraman: Logan, come on. We're losing the light. -Caroline, i-- -you know what? Go back. I wouldn't want you to lose your light. -Come on, Logan. -Come on, let's go. Get in here. That's it, okay. All right, come on everybody right in camera. Let's get it right. Beautiful. Okay, excellent. Good. Right here. Logan, come on. Right in here. Great. -Manu, kimo, come here. Have you seen Lea? -No. Haven't seen her for a while. -Follow me. -Mitch, I'm kinda tired. I got to rest for a second. -Okay. Let me see that map, huh. -Okay. Looks like we're right on course. Big green rock, palm tree. Don't move. -What? -I said, don't move. -What is it? -If I tell ya, you'll freak. -Mitch, enough of these jungle games, okay? Grow up. -I tried it. It's uh, it's overrated. Just, don't move. -What are you doing? What are you doing? Okay. There's a snake. Is there a snake around me? -Nah, nah, nah, you've seen too many movies, pal. There are no snakes in Hawaii. Now, when I tell you to move, you dive out of the way. -Which direction? -Move! Whoa! Huh! Look at the size of that thing! -Matt: What is that? -No big deal. Just a deadly, poisonous centipede. What's that? Lea. What's going on? -Kona sent me to guide you because he got to worrying about your safety. -Well, we're glad he did. We could use the help. She will find out the hard way she cannot leave me. -[Speaking foreign language] Let's go take them now. -Lead the way. -All in good time, manu. It's like guiding a fish to the right spot and spearing it. Let's go. -Hi. Where've you been? What was the emergency? -Brian and rusty found an abandoned zodiac. It's Mitch and Matt's. All their gear is still in it, but no sign of them. -Are you sure? -That's where I been. I check it out myself. Look, I got a helicopter fueled, ready to go. We can start on the island where the zodiac was found. Come on, let's go. -Hey. We're being followed, man. -Are you sure? -Mitch: Yeah. -Come on. We've gotta keep going. -No, hang on a second. We wanna rest a little bit here, Lea. -No! I mean, we should keep going. -Why? Nothing's urgent here. All we gotta do is catch a chopper back to the north shore. Unless there's something we don't know about. We are being followed. What's going on? -I'm sorry. I lied to you. Kona didn't send me. I ran away. -Why did you run away? I mean, you could have left if you wanted to. -No! I've tried. But Marco's cruel and very jealous. And if he discovers I'm missing, he'll come after me, just like he has before. -You tried to leave before? -I always thought that I had family somewhere. -Well, what about kona? Can't he help you? -I've tried to tell kona I wanted to leave, how important it was to me. But he says this is where I belong and that I should forget any other life. In the beginning, I could forget, but not any longer. I wanna find my home. -Then, we'll take you home. Right? -Well, I think it's a safe bet that mako knows she's gone. He's probably the one who's following US. -Well, then when he gets here, we'll just tell him that she's coming home with US. Or not. -Let's go! -Mitch! -Lea, how far to this fishing village? -About 20 minutes. -20 minutes? We'll never outrun them. -We lost them, but not for long. -I got an idea. -Matt: Come on. Come on. -We just bought ourselves some time. Get rid of these, huh. -Lea! [Helicopter whirring] Listen, listen, listen! -That's a helicopter. We got to get to a clearing. -Come on, this way! -Manu, kimo. Kimo, come on. Manu, get up! There they go! Come on! Let's go! -Look! There they are! -They're being chased. -Let's scoop them up. We'll ask questions later. Let's go down. -Mitch! -Run! Run, come on! -Matt: Help, come on! Come on, come on! -Go, go, go! -Lea! You can't leave me! Lea! -What are you doing here? -Didn't you get my message from the front desk? -The concierge told me to be here at 10 o'clock for the snorkel boat. There is no snorkel boat, is there? -No, but I didn't think you'd come down to meet me. -Logan, I don't want it to-- -just listen. You said to me yesterday, that you didn't think you're important to me. You were wrong. You're the most important thing in my life. Nothing's any meaning without you there with me. Nothing's any fun, not even the damn surf competition. I'm in love with you, Caroline. And I wanna share the rest of my life with you. Look. -Yes! Yes, I'll marry you! -I never wanna lose you. And I'll do whatever it takes to let you know that you're number one in my life. 'Til death do US part. -Go, Caroline! -Well, should I go? Should I go? Should I go? -Go. -Logan: Yeah? -Woo! -Mark: Woo, yeah! -They're great together, aren't they? -Yeah. -Wow, I didn't know you could dance like that. -That was unreal. -Congratulations on your engagement. Oh, you two really look like you love each other. -We do. -Can't ask for anything more. Brother in law. -Sister! -Hey. -Hey, hey, hey. -Congratulations, Carlton. You really look like your luck has changed. -Yeah, I got a great job with kona bay Hilton as a photographer. And, well, me and Holly, we're kinda seeing each other. -Carlton. -Well, looks like you've got everything going for you. So don't forget, no more good luck charms. -Hey, there's one thing I'm never gonna forget, and that's you. -Mark: Oh. -Thank you very much. Oh, wait! Group shot, group shot! Group shot! -Group shot. -Woo, yeah! Hey, Mitch, Matt. One more, please. -Come on in! -Okay. Yeah, all right. -Okay, cheese! -All right, all right! Got a little ceremony here. Ladies, come on in. Little toast here. -Oh, wow! -Grab a glass, grab a glass. -This is a traditional Hawaiian wedding lei. Congratulations. -Logan: Thank you. -Congratulations. -Caroline: Thank you. -A toast to the future Mr. and Mrs. Fowler. -May your marriage always be paradise.
