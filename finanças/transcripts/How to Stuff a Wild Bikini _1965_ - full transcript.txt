We now take you to the tropics, to the lush and lovely guna guna islands. These islands were once known as the... [Cuckoo] Islands... But that was before the naval reserve established headquarters here. At this time of the year in guna guna, naval activity is at its peak. So, let's take a peek. On the other hand, not too much can be said for the reserve. [Laughter] Woman: It will be like this forever, Frankie, no? No. Why not? Here in guna guna, you have everything, yes? Oh, yes. Then you will stay forever, Frankie, no? No. But, Frankie-- only if you consider 6 weeks forever. That's how much I've got to go on my naval reserve hitch. But after the Navy, you still have me. I also have a girl back home. Is she pretty? Oh, she's beautiful. Then she will be making love, too, just as we are. Dee Dee? Mm-hmm. Certainly not. She wouldn't be unfaithful. Why not? Because she's a girl. [Chuckles] You Navy boys have funny idea-- ok for boy, but not ok for girl. Here in guna guna, we have better idea. When you are not with the boy you love, love the boy you're with. Not Dee Dee. She's different. You mean she wouldn't put her arms around a boy like this, or kiss him like this? She wouldn't. Or would she? I know a way you can find out. I don't think I want to find out. Come. Come with me, Frankie. His name is bwana-- best witch doctor in all of guna guna. Witch doctor? Member of a.M.A. Oh, good. Well, look, I'm broke. Is he with blue cross? He will make terms with you. Come on. [Bird squawking] Nice, huh? It reminds me of my dentist's office. Where are all the old magazines? Bwana. Sorry. I was on house call. Bwana, this is Frankie. He has a problem. Name problem. Well, you see, I have this girl back in the states, and I want to know if she's true to me. You come right place. [Honk] Khola koku. Yes, bwana. Sailor boy need help. Yeah, yeah! No, no. Not that kind of help. Boola boola. Mumbo jumbo. Hanky-panky. Recipe. "4 toad's eyes, "2 turtle tongues, "a gnat's whiskers, "a pinch of rattlesnake fang, one dozen frog legs." No, no. That's tonight's dinner. Bwana: Problem all solved. Get bird's-eye view of girl at all times. Bird's-eye view. How are you going to get that? With a bird, of course. Yeah, yeah. How much is this going to cost? Name price. How about...Uh... 3 mangos a day? No deal. Since sailor boys come to island, natives wise up. Each day you bring one pint torpedo juice. You mean...Alcohol? Each day you squeeze torpedo good. Bring here. All right, it's a deal, bwana. I'll be here every day and get your report. Supposing report not so good-- still want to hear? Listen, bwana, you call yourself a witch doctor. Can't you swing out with a spell or something? Bwana been in business a good many years and maybe lose some power. But I have daughter in back room who's best witch on island. Don't go away. I help, sailor boy. You try, and I'll belt you. She may be small, but she's wiry. Watch it. Voila. Daughter do it again. We put out decoy, a creature so beautiful that no boy will look at your girl. For a pint of torpedo juice a day, you guarantee your work? Witch's honor. And now excuse, please. I got to make one more house call. Man: I beg your pardon. [Squawks] [Squawks excitedly] [Plays dissonant chord] [Cheering] Wow! Dig that wild bikini. Yeah! Yeah! It ain't nothin' without the stuffin'. How do we stuff it? Easy, man. You just... * take a girl with sunlight in her hair * * and a face that's rare beyond compare * * and a 36-22-36 * that's how you * stuff a wild bikini * take a girl with eyes as blue as sky * * a pretty girl with eyes that hypnotize * * and a 36-22-36 * that's how you * stuff a wild bikini * ah, ah, ah, ah * ah, ah, ah, ah * stuff a wild bikini * take a girl that's lovely as can be * * any girl will do as long as she * * is a 36-22-36 * that's how you * stuff a wild bikini * 36-22-36 * that's how you * stuff a wild bikini by George, I think she's got it. [Speaking Italian] [Speaking German] [Southern accent] Man, is that ever a girl? Guitar player: I hope she can't swim. Why? I'd love to give her artificial respiration. [Cheering] Hi, fellas. Hi. You probably have a name. They call me Cassandra. Then that's what I'll call you. Hee hee! Brilliant. It's going to be a long hot summer. Yeah. Long for US and hot for her. Where are you from, Cassandra? I'm from a long way off, and I'm here to have fun and keep you fellas happy. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, fellas. Gentlemen. Hey, boys, how's it hopping? Well, to whom do we owe this pleasure? Well, my name, gentlemen, is j. Peachmont keane. But my friends all call me peachy. What brings you here, peachy? Well, one of the biggest, most important assignments of my illustrious career-- an advertising campaign. I'm looking for the perfect girl to go in the perfect bikini along with the perfect boy. These two will be featured in all of our ads depicting the new image in motorcycling, the girl and boy next door ride bikini bikes. Would you mind repeating that? Shut up, dum-dum. And, my little peanut, what do they call you? Peanut. Ha ha. That's what I get for asking questions. And you, chicky baby, what do they call you? They call me chickie. How did you-all guess? Aw, fuss and feathers. Well, you could be the girl next door, but i'd need a ladder. Guitar player: Peachy, I think we have something you'll like. Fellas, open up. How's this? How's this? Sweetheart, you're it. Oh, I don't think so, sir. I'm not really what I seem to be. You're wrong. When peachy raves, nobody raps. Tell them, boy. When peachy runs it up the flagpole, everybody salutes, and I quote him. Are you all right? You're gorgeous. Beautiful, maybe, but not gorgeous. Suddenly, I'm forgetting why I'm here. I'll clue you. You're here to keep US happy. Yeah. Yeah. No. I'm here to keep him happy. Uh, you move too fast for me. It's more fun the hard way. That boy's sick. Well, dear, we'll put this on the train to Atlanta and see if it whistles Dixie. Hold it still. Ta-da! We've done it again. [Chuckles] What's wrong with her? Ah, she's all right, but when I saw you sitting over here by yourself, I felt something happening in here. Have you tried fizrin? You think I'm kidding? I'm not thinking about it one way or the other. What's your name? Delores. But my friends call me Dee Dee. All right, Dee Dee, let's talk about US. You can call me delores. All right, delores, let's talk about US. First of all, for example, this suit, it's not the real me. I'm afraid you're barking up the wrong girl. I have a fella. Oh? Where is he? He's in the south pacific, the naval reserves. [Squawks] Look, you've got a guy on a tropical island. You think that's a monastery or something? [Squawking] Is that your bird? No. What Frankie does is his business. I have my own principles, and I have to live with them. I hope you carry an oxygen mask. You live pretty high up. Why, b.D. Will go out of his cotton picking... Who's b.D.? B.d. Mcpherson--my boss. Why, he'll flip. I'm sorry. No, peachy. I don't-- what do you mean, "no, peachy"? You-- I think she's right, peachy. How about me? Woman: How about me? How about me? Women: * if you're lookin' for girls who are pretty * * hey, why all the fuss? * quit your looking, you're in the right city * * hey, now, how about US? * we got charm * we got looks * we got brains * we read books [Boom] * we're the chicks who know all the tricks * * hey, now, how about US? Hey, chicky babies, over here. All: * if you're lookin' for someone who's thrilling * * we are girls you can trust * * you'll see, we can be ready and willing * * hey, now, how about US? * we got charm * we got class * we got brains * we think fast * we're the chicks who know all the tricks * * hey, now, how about US? * now, when I say * that I think you'll do nicely * * I mean what I say * * it's just that * well, that I mean precisely * * she's my choice for today * women: * we got charm... * special appeal * she's just right for "big deal" * women: * we're the chicks who know all the tricks * * hey, now, how about US? * it's her I prefer * hey, now, how about US? * it's got to be her * hey, now * how about US? You're wild, chicky babies, wild. But she is the wildest. I won't stop trying. I'd hate you if you did. [Squawking] You know something? I don't think your bird likes me either. Here's my card. Here, chicky baby. Be at the office at 2:00 tomorrow. B.d. Is winging in himself from the big town for confabs with the ad toppers. But really, Mr. Keane, I couldn't-- wait a minute. What do you mean, you couldn't? A nationwide tour with Ricky here? I couldn't very well pass that up, could I? In the smaller towns, you might come in handy. Then it's a date-- 2:00 tomorrow. Oh, boy, this is bigger than cellophane. B.d. Will go ape. Bye. [Pelican squawking] Either they're strangers here, or I am. Wherever you are, boney, you're a stranger. Come on. Hello. How are you? Jolly good. Thank you. Hey, you're English. Quite. My name's Cynthia. Well, i'm Johnny, and this is bonehead, accent on the first syllable. How do you do? I'd like you to meet some friends. This is Maria from Italy. [Speaking Italian] And this is hulda from Germany. She's from dusseldorf. Mighty pretty country around there. Danke schon. Gesundheit. How come the united nations is meeting at the beach? We heard so much about america and the girls on the beach. We decided to investigate. Anytime you want to investigate the boys... Woman, southern accent: Hi there. You-all must be new hereabouts. Where are you from? I'm from Georgia. That's in the south. Cynthia: Of what country? Well, there she is, gentlemen. Now, I want you to tell me, one and all, just exactly what you all think. I can't wait for b.D.'S reaction. Why, when "big deal" mcpherson sees this, his gourd will come unglued. [All talking at once] Ah! All: Good morning, b.D. Good morning, peachy sweetheart. How are you? Good morning. Fine. Never better. Now, b.D., what do you think of this? What do you boys think? Well, I think it's, uh... You're absolutely right. Good thinking. Couldn't have put it better myself. It's always nice to have a consensus like that. Personally, I'd run it up the flagpole, and it plays old glory. Peachy, you've done it again. Thanks, b.D. This is going to be one of my big ones. Right. Right. Right. Peachy, I want you to sign up that girl immediately. Tut, tut, tut, b.D. I've signed her already. I might have known, sweetheart. * when it comes to great * * I'm the one who'll state * * I'm simply mad about you, dad * all but b.D. * simply mad about you, dad * he's the greatest on mad Avenue * * Madison av-av-av-av-Avenue * * he's the greatest on Madison Avenue * * mmm... Wonderful, sweetheart. Just wonderful. [Intercom buzzes] Hello. CBS? Exclusively, sweetheart. [Intercom buzzes] Ad men: * mmm... Hello. Nbc? Yours alone, baby. [Intercom buzzes] Ad men: * mmm... Hello. Abc? You've got it, chicky baby. * he's the one you see * who can tell TV * just how TV ought to be ad men: * just how TV ought to be * all but b.D.: * he's the greatest on mad Avenue * * Madison av-av-av-av-Avenue * * he's the greatest on Madison Avenue * * mmm... Beautiful, baby. Just beautiful. [Intercom buzzes] [Squawking] Do you ever get the feeling 3 is a crowd? Sometimes it's a nice, safe feeling. Yeah. You know, I'm glad you changed your mind about our date tonight. I'm faithful, not dead. There's a difference? There's a difference. Tell me what that was all about yesterday. Well, I'm part of a campaign to change the image for the motorcycle rider. You're kidding. What's funny? [Pelican squawking] What's with this crazy bird? I'm beginning to wonder myself. Woman: Hi, Johnny. Johnny: Operation Cassandra. [Knock knock] Operation Cassandra. Operation Cassandra. Come on. Ready, fellas? Ready! Ready! Ready! Johnny: * with a face like that * * and eyes like those * * from the top of your head * * to the tip of your toes * * oh, I'll tell the world * * that's what I call a healthy girl * together: * with a smile like that * * and lips like those * * and the cute little way * * that you wrinkle up your nose * * I'll tell the world * * that's what I call a healthy girl * * you don't need money * * to be rich, honey Johnny: * I'd say you're wealthy * * when you're that healthy * men: * with a charm like that * * in times like these * * you could be a star * * baby, on TV together: * I'll tell the world * * that's what I call a healthy girl * I think that bird's got a crazy beat. Together: * you don't need money * * to be rich, honey * * I'd say you're wealthy * * when you're that healthy * oh, with a charm like that... * why don't you join the mob? Oh, I'm not much of a joiner. Not when you're around. You see, I, uh, I get this feeling. Heartburn? Yeah. Men: * I'll tell the world * * that's what I call a healthy girl * * I'll tell the world * * that's what I call * * a healthy girl [cheering] Hey, fella, have you seen a girl in a leopard bikini? Certainly not. Hey, girls, have you seen Cassandra? See that group of panting hyenas over there? Yes. Well, drive a path right up the middle, and you'll find Cassandra. I should have known. [All talking at once] Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Please, look, step aside, will you, please? Get back, please. Fellas, will you be quiet, please? You'll bother her. How did you know? I got an "a" in biology. Bye. Bonehead: Hey, what's he want her for? Now, that's really a stupid question. Thanks. Well, I guess she's going to be it. It? My partner in the campaign. I wish it was going to be you. No chance. There's going to be a cross-country bike race, the boy and girl next door against the field. It'll be a ball. No, thanks. Maybe that's why I like you so much. You don't tempt easy. Let's take a walk. Ok. [Pelican squawking] Why are you so sure you don't want to be the girl next door? I am the girl next door, and I'm not moving. It's fun-- bike riding. Let me show you. Ok, that seems fair. Tomorrow I'll take you for a ride. You'll be surprised. I don't think so. I have a simple theory. If you're not with the girl that you love, love the girl that you're with. [Pelican squawking] Whee! Whee! Well? It's wild. I had no idea. Told you you'd be surprised. I have a surprise for you. I'd like to ride with you in the cross-country race. Let's go back. I don't want to press my luck. You come for daily report on Dee Dee? You bring torpedo juice? Yeah. [Steam whistle blowing] Good batch today. Tell sailor boy Dee Dee teetering. I wish I could tell him she tottered. Teetered, tottered... Don't punch up the information. Dee Dee safe. Bird watch her like hawk. What about decoy? Daughter blew it with decoy. Mix up important ingredients. Use one ounce dove blood instead of one ounce gazelle blood. Dove blood, make love. Gazelle blood, make graceful. Boy come along, jarred her giblets. Now all we have is lovesick stumblebum. And that's all the plot you're going to get out of me. Right in here to my office, my dear Cassandra. Behind the desk. Over here, darling. There we are. And then we're going to sign the contract. Sign the contract, that's what we're going to do. Here it is. Ah! Look at that. And, uh, oh-- you haven't even signed it yet. Excuse me. Here we are. Right there on the dotted line, if you will. Ah, no reading. Just sign it. There we are. What's the matter, dear, huh? There doesn't seem to be any ink in this thing. Well, that, uh... Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, that's quite all right, my dear. It can happen to anybody. Quite all right. Just point it the other way, dear. Mr. Keane, i'm-- don't worry about it. It can happen to anybody. Just refill the pen, dear. Let me sit over here and dry it out, that's all. I just feel terrible. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. But you didn't give me a chance to explain. See, I'm not like other girls. You see... I'm sort of clumsy. I'm beginning to discover that. Why don't you just run along, Cassandra? What about the contract? Later, later, later, dear. Yes, peachy has a little thinking to do now. Here's your pen. No, keep it. You may want to spot somebody else. Thanks, peachy. Yes, thank you. [Groans] Hello. B.D.? About this girl Cassandra-- b.d.: She's the greatest. Nothing but raves. You've really zeroed in on this, peachy baby. Now, look, b.D., I was just thinking. I do the thinking for this organization. Check? Check. I mean, check, chief! I'm running right beside you all the way on this, peachy baby. Are you with me? Yes, I... I'm with you, chief, all the way. You ought to be in pictures, baby. Peachy: What would I do in pictures? No, not you, peachy. You just don't let that girl out of your sight, and that's all you got to do. Right-o, chief. Bye. That's all, honey. Thanks. Peachy, on this new account... I tossed it off the bridge, and it bounces. Well, that's great, b.D. I want the benefit of your thinking on this... I think. Well, anything you think is aces with me, b.D., you know? What's the matter? Is something wrong? No. It's nothing. Are you looking for something? No, not a thing. Not a thing, b.D. What am I looking for? It's nothing. Nothing at all, b.D. Ha ha. Nothing. Ha ha. I like you better this way. I told you that derby and gray flannel suit wasn't the real me. I'm glad. It's good chicken. Fried it myself, me and the colonel. Maybe if we give your bird some, it'll fly away. He's beginning to bother me, too. [Squawks] There you are, boss. Not me. Him, him. Get off. [Squawking] [Speaking German] [Speaking Italian] Terribly spiffy, don't you know? That's a funny game. Yeah. Cycles is better. Them beach bums is back, and this time, they got to go, right? Right. Right. Right. Whoa. Only not all of them got to go. Well, here we are at the beach, the solution to all of our problems. Come along, my dear. Woo! Ooh! Ooh! Glasses! Why me? Why me all the time, huh? [Spits] Fix them. Fix them. [Giggles] She's nifty, right? Men: Right. Here we go again. Woman: He adores her. I think I adore her. [Chuckles] That girl, she's my kind of people. Yeah, boss. Looks like you two were made for each other. Listen, j.D., you and puss find out who the little guy is with the funny hat and the girl. Find out who they are and what they do, right? Ok. Turn them over. Let's get out of here. I'm all right, I think. Yeah. Johnny: You all right? Oh, sure. Sure, one of US is all right, I think. See, I have a problem. You have a problem? You ought to know about my problem. Now, listen, everybody, Cassandra here lacks something, even though it might not show. Now, I thought that, maybe, you, being young and athletic, you might help her. You understand? Sure, we can. Right, gang? Anything for you, peachy. Bonehead: Sounds like a full-time job, and I'm full-time. Come on, Cassandra. First we'll teach you how to surf. That sounds marvy. Come on. Yeah, that sounds peachy. You can use this one, Cassandra. Oh, thank you. Oh! Oh, sorry. That's all right. It happens all-- Cassandra. Yes. Ooh. Oh! Ow! Cassandra: Mr. Keane, sorry. I guess I'm just hopeless. Well, what makes you so hopeless? I don't know. I think it has something to do with boys. They make me nervous. They make you nervous? Look, girls, girls, you're looking at a man with a tremendous problem. Look--Cassandra-- couldn't you help to make her more like you? I mean, you know, make her so that she, uh... Could you give me some help? No chance. If Cassandra is clumsy, let's keep her that way. Come on. Let's go see. [Squawking softly] Hey, what about him? Oh, he'll be all right. She hit him in the head. Peachy: Lookit, girls, you got to help me. You're looking at a desperate man. Dee Dee: You're being shortsighted, animal. Mr. Keane wants to take Cassandra on a nationwide tour for an ad campaign. Yes! Oh, well, in that case, we'll help you. No offense, Cassandra. I'll help, too. It'll give me something to occupy my time. Thanks a bunch. I could be kidding. I'll buy that...For now. Hey, stupid, what does this one say? Man: It says... [Mispronounces] "Peachmont keane." That's the guy. Come on. Let's go. Just a minute. Gentlemen, ladies, you have to have an appointment. My idol. Me? Not you. Her. That's what I come to talk to you about. Woman: I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Keane. I tried to stop-- quite all right, miss Simms. Don't you believe in knocking? You want to know why I come here? No. I'm glad you asked that question. Because when that girl goes on tour as america's ideal youth... I, Eric Von zipper, am going with her. Oh, oh, that's wonderful. She is my idol, while I am my ideal. And when I win the cycle cross-country race, I will then have a new, uh... Puss and boots: Image. Right. I will then be america's ideal. I will be the boy next door. Next door to San Quentin. Ha ha ha. Tell him. Gang: * he's the boy * the voters should carry * the kind of boy * your sister should marry * he's the ideal, healthy * red-blooded, all-American * * boy next door that's me. * I'm the boy next door * gang: * he's kind to dumb animals * * and what's more * and little old ladies * you'll adore * he never says "Hades" * the boy next door * gang: * he'll never be a freak * * he's just a boy * you can check with your sister * * the kind of boy * who'd tell if he kissed her * gang: * he's the ideal, healthy * * red-blooded, all-American * * boy next door Gang: * he's the boy * the voters should carry * the kind of boy * your sister should marry * he's the ideal, healthy * red-blooded, all-American * * boy next door you can say that again. Gang: * he's the boy next door * * I never do dirty deeds * gang: * and what's more * or Halloween capers * you'll adore... * I'm an idol teenager * * the boy next door * such a keen neighbor * gang: * he's the boy the voters should carry * * the kind of boy your sister should marry * * he's the ideal, healthy * red-blooded, all-American * * boy next door * he's the ideal, healthy * red-blooded, all-American boy next... * [cheering] Just keep your balance. Great. Good. Now, turn around and try it again. Hey, great. How come a girl that looks like that has to have coordination, too? I don't know. I guess it's just a little added something for the girl who has everything. How's our girl doing? Dee Dee: To quote you, "peachy perfect." We put her out to sea and she floats. Oh, she's adorable. Peachy: Here, dear. Let me have that piece of wood, will you, please? [Birds chirping] Oh. Look, come with me. And walk carefully. The life you save may be mine. I really don't know much about myself. Maybe I don't have a background. No, but you have, my dear. I assure you. The first thing I remember about me is there on that beach when the boys came running toward me. Did you fall on that occasion? Oh, no. I couldn't. Now we're getting somewhere. Why couldn't you fall? You should see these boys. When they crowd around you, they crowd. Young lady, yours is a simple case of malephobia. A fear of the opposite sex. Oh, well, doctor, can it possibly be cured? Of course. The cure is as simple as the disease. Would you stand up, please? Not you, sir. The patient. Say to yourself, "I am a normal girl." I'm a normal girl. And I want you to regard me as a normal boy. You're a normal boy. Now, I'm going to come to you, shake your hand, tell you good-bye, and your troubles are over. All right? Huh. That's perfect. [Birds squawking] Dee Dee, 2 to 1-- right now Frankie is swinging way out with some native chick. [Squawks] Ah, shut up. I told you, Ricky, I don't care what Frankie is doing. Look, Dee Dee, you can't stay a brownie all your life. It's pitch time again. It's time you started acting your age. The best I can do right now, Rick, is a firm maybe. [Thud] Oh, now, be very careful of these stairs, my dear. Very careful, now. Good, good. Marvelous. Announcer: And now, here are the kingsmen. * people say, oh, boy, you don't know how to live * * the only thing you do in life * * is take and not give * * you got to have one thing * * to make your life worthwhile * * I got a little girl who's nothing but wild... * now, remember what the doctor said. You're supposed to mix with these boys around here. Here comes a reasonable facsimile. How do you do, young man? Miss Cassandra, ma'am, would you care to trip the light fantastic with old bonehead? By all means. I meant her. So did I. Go ahead, Cassandra. Dance with this young gentleman. Go ahead. That's it. Marvelous. * ...To give my love to * how happy could I be when I got nothing to do... * I have to warn you about something, bonehead. Too late to warn me about you. I'm already sunk. * give her loving * give her loving as long as I may live * * because I found what it's like... * care to try again? Yeah. Again and again and again. * let me go now, oh, come on * * one more time, yeah * ah, with you * I knew that I missed something right from the start * * I had a barren, empty feeling deep in my heart * * I found a little girl to give my love to * * how happy can I be when I got nothing to do but give her loving? * * give her loving from the bottom of my heart * * I give her, give her, give her loving * * give her loving from the very start * * I give her loving, yeah, yeah, * * yeah, yeah, yeah * I found what it's like to give * hey! Kingsmen: Hey! [Cheering] And now for a big surprise. It's a big surprise to Dee Dee, who doesn't know she's going to sing. How about it, Dee Dee? Say yes. I'd like to hear how it sounds for once. * you better be ready when love comes swinging along * kingsmen: * ooh, ooh, ooh * * you better know the words * * to that familiar old song * * ooh, ooh, ooh * * words that say, "till the end of time" * * "I'll be his, and he'll be mine" * * you better be ready when love comes swinging along * * you better be ready when bells start ringing * * you better be ready when love comes singing * * words that say, "till the end of time" * * "I'll be his, and he'll be mine" * * you better be ready when love comes swinging along * * you better be ready when bells start ringing out strong * kingsmen: * ah, ah, ah * never be the one to ever let a love go wrong * * ah, ah, ah * when that true love comes your way * * just be sure that it's here to stay * * you better be ready when love comes swinging * * you better be ready when bells start ringing * * you better be ready when love comes swinging along * Peachy: Oh, boy. My idol. The boy next door just dropped in. She is my idol, right? Gang: Right. Madam, it would give me great pleasure to give you the pleasure of having this here dance with me. Cassandra, the doctor wanted you to mix with the boys. And I am the boy next door. That's where I wished you were-- next door, that is. Music. [Growls] Gang: Music. [Music playing] Oh! Aah! Stop the music. Stop the music. That's enough for the first time. Funny. When I dance with boys, I usually stumble. But with you, it's different. Yeah, well, I'm different. I'd worry about that, boss. Eric Von zipper never worries. Peachy, I was perfect. Yes, you were wonderful. Thanks to Eric Von zipper. And now I'm going to let you ride with me, partner, in the cycle cross-country race. You're a little late. She rides with Ricky. She don't ride with nobody but me. [Snaps fingers] Get the hat. Get the hat. Strange fellow. You I don't like. Gang: You he don't like. Eric: And when Eric Von zipper don't like somebody, they stay don't liked. In fact, I'm thinking of giving you the cycler's curse. What is all this? The carbon monoxide commandos. Von zipper: Stand up. Grab my wrist. Don't do it, boss. Now, you try to stop me, but you won't be able to because Eric Von zipper has muscles of steel from cycling. I'm just going to point this finger at your temple. I'm going to give you a... My money's on you, Rick. Like this? The boss done it again-- give himself the finger. Let's get him out of here. He's fragile. Don't break him. Get his leg. Eric Von zipper will return. [Squawking] What was that all about? It's a long story. Maybe if I gave you the cycler's curse, maybe then you'd-- I'm not that much of a brownie, Rick. Prove it. How? Well, there's a moon out there and a beach and the ocean. But you know what's not out there? US. Why don't you try asking? Consider yourself asked. Consider yourself asked. Watch it, there. Don't hit US, Mike. He's really out this time. Let's put him on the table. Yeah. Oh, why always tilt?! [Pinball machine clicking and buzzing] Hey, say that again! Tilt! The magic word! [Ship horn] Where am I? I'm glad I asked that question because now I know where I am. Hey, where's south Dakota slim, the guy that's always around here? I drummed him out. Yeah? Who are you? I'm slim's mean brother-- north Dakota Pete. There ain't nobody meaner than old slim. Nah! He didn't even like me. He was that mean. In our family, we call slim "baby Alice." He was the sissy of the family. What's slim doing now? He's social director at a... [Crrrk] Suicide club. That sounds pretty mean. You think that's mean? When I was a kid in school, you know what I used to do to the little girls sitting in front of me? Sure. You used to take their pigtails and stick them in the inkwell. Uh-uh. I used to stick the whole girl in the inkwell. [Diabolical laughter] That is mean. Yeah, it ain't nice. Hey, you want to play me one for pin money? No. I'm too mad. I don't know. Aw! What's bugging ya, boobie? That fancy cycle fella made him give himself the finger. Oh! You want this boobie taken care of? [Opens knife] You would do that for me? Old Pete's got ideas! Those that ain't vile are foul! [Laughing] Ah, we've really got it made. The moon, the stars, the ocean. You and I. There's just one thing missing, and by happy coincidence, this is my pad right here. Well, you can't beat that for luck. Care to see it? Why not? I've never been to Japan before. [Squawking] Old Japanese custom for modern Japanese house. [Squawks] Shall we? Wow! It's colorful. You really have brought a bit of the orient to the shores of Malibu. Well, it's humble, but I call it home. Upstairs for living... Downstairs for... Really living. You must do very well here. You said it. I mean, uh, you said it; I didn't. Um... [Soft music playing] Like it? That's the kind of music a girl should run from. But I'm staying. Strike one on me. Care for a drink? Coke, if you have it. Strike one on me. Uh...we, uh... We may as well be comfortable. Ah! You have everything here but food to take out. Wait till you read your fortune cookie. It's rigged. You got good news for me today, bwana baby? Call me by my full name: Bwana chicky baby. Sorry. [Steam whistle blowing] Khola koku. Yes, master. Stir. Stop. Stand back. Torpedo juice real witches' brew. Dee Dee... Uh-oh. Looks bad. [Soft music playing] To the night and the music and US. [Pelican squawking] Point killer. Why don't you throw him a fish? Maybe he'll go away. Very funny, but I'll throw him something. Rick, don't! That's not nice. It's just a poor, helpless pelican. You sure this isn't your bird? Brownie's honor. [Pelican squawking] How'd you get in here? This place is sealed and soundproofed! Birdie! Birdie, come on. Fly away, birdie. Birdie? Nice birdie. Birdie. Bird-- come on. You dirty bird, fly! Fish, you said. I'll give him a fish. [Squawks] [Gulp] [Squawking] Well! Well, that takes care of that. Now, where... Hey, where are you going? Home. The pelican changed my mind. That dirty bird. You, uh, forgot your shoes. I'll pick them up in the morning-- in broad daylight. The whole crazy evening shot, not to mention a can of imported sardines. Bwana: Dee Dee almost goofed. Oh, goody! But not quite. Bird save day. Oh, pooh! Want a slug of torpedo juice? Me khola koku. Me good girl. Oh, a little slug won't mean anything. Ahh! Me tanda layo. Me ba girl! We're going to have to get this show on the road. Otherwise, my name isn't "big deal" mcpherson. Yes, b.D. You signed the girl. I didn't. Remember that. That's right. I signed her, b.D. That's right. And we're not going to let this fall through, are we? Yes, sir. I mean, no, no, sir. If this Von zipper character is the only boy that Cassandra does relate to, then we've got to change his image. What? You're going to have to change his image, or I'm going to run you up the flagpole at half-mast, and don't you forget it! Yes, sir. Yes, b.D. "And don't believe the junk you hear about tropical islands. "I think they took all the girls off when they moved the Navy in. "Not that that would make any difference to me because there's only one girl in my life." We ought to change your name to lucky. * the perfect boy doesn't have to be a Hercules * * Hercules * the perfect boy doesn't have to be euripides * * ripides * brawn or brains, he doesn't need to be * * what I mean to say is, actually * * the perfect boy only has to be * * just true to me * the perfect boy doesn't have to be a movie star * * movie star * the perfect boy doesn't have to drive a fancy car * * fancy car * fame nor wealth he doesn't need, you see * * what I mean to say is, actually * * the perfect boy only has to be * * faithful * true and faithful to me girls: Oh, yeah! Dee Dee: Hi, animal. Come over here. I've got another tune you should hear. Oh. See you later, girls. Girls: Bye! You're not going to like this, but not knowing would be worse. It's a letter Frankie sent to Mike. It's quite a different tune. "The girl shortage here is terrible. "Imagine, only 6 girls to every guy. "I personally have 4 gorgeous native girls "working for me in my hut. One cooks, one sews, and one does the laundry." That's only 3. That's right. Men! They're all beasts! Yeah. And isn't it wonderful? Look, Dee Dee, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. You're absolutely right, animal, and I'm not going to cook, sew, or do the laundry! What are you doing here? I should ask you the same question. I was here first. Dee Dee: About this girl-- I can explain. Don't bother. You men are all alike. Look, I can't spend all my life chasing you around. Speaking of chasing... Ricky: Now, now, Dee Dee. No violence, now! Look, Michelle, you run along, and I'll talk to you later and-- What's this all about? I changed my mind. Have my kimono ready at 7:00. I say she makes it. I say she don't. All right. Put your knife where your mouth is. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! So what's the matter? Can't a fella improve his image now and then? Hey, why ain't you-- ahem--aren't you out destroying that Ricky fella? Old Pete strikes at night. Ha ha ha! Ow! Hey, boss, what happened? I added to my image. I am not only the boy next door, but I am the typical young businessman on his way up. On his way out! The king is dead. We ain't got no leader no more, right? All: Right! Hey! Hey! Wait a minute. I am still your leader, and I'll tell you why. * if there's an image to preserve * * the right to that image I reserve * * and so * let's go * follow your leader * what is this new deal? * * follow your leader * boss, are you for real? * ain't it nice?

Dee Dee very shaky, ready to make plunge. Best news I've heard in weeks! [Hiccup] It's really that bad? Mm-hmm. You sure bwana wasn't full of torpedo juice? Only one swallow. Face it, Frankie, you've only got a week left of your reserve. It looks as though Dee Dee doesn't have any left of hers. You can't say that about her. I didn't. It came straight from bwana's daughter. What am I going to do? Here I am, stuck out here... With me. With you. Well... It's better than a kick in the head, boobie. Now, where were we when I was so rudely interrupted by that big, big point killer last night? Just about right here. * here we are * the two of US * with your lips close to mine * * if it's gonna happen * * your lips will do just fine * * here we are alone at last * * with your hands holding mine * * if it's gonna happen * * your hands will do just fine * * maybe the dream that I dreamed of * * didn't quite come true * but, baby * if I'm falling in love * I'm glad that it's with you * * here we are * the two of US * now, this must be the time * * if it's gonna happen * we're gonna do just fine * if it's gonna happen * we're gonna do * just fine want to buy a brownie outfit cheap? [Pete laughing] Old Pete's got ya, boobie! What are you going to do with me? This. Oh! Come on, fight fair. Pete: Aaah! Oh, that's the name of the game, huh? Oh! [Birds chirping] Thanks, boobie. Ricky! I'm sorry! [Pete laughing] That's all right. I... I guess this just isn't my night. Oh! Don't worry. There'll be other nights. I hope so. I want to congratulate you, peachy. You've taken this cross- country race thing off the launching pad right into orbit. It's celestial. Thanks, b.D. Ha ha! Our boy Ricky wouldn't have stood a chance against a pro like Von zipper. On the other hand, we'd have been sunk if a leather jacket had won it. That's why I had to change Von zipper's image. He's the perfect winner image now because his image is just like yours. That's the kind of image I like-- clean-cut, American, a born winner, no matter what you have to do to win. But what if Von zipper doesn't win? Oh, there's not a chance he won't win. I've got a little insurance policy going for US. You know, a little, uh... Connivery. I knew you were my kind of an ad man the minute you stole your first account from those thieves at b.V.D. And u. Thanks, b.D. Ha ha! Well, I must be off. Pete: Here's one of them road forks with a sign saying "turn right." Old Pete's painted the back side of that sign, so when Ricky comes along, one of you boobies twists it, and it reads "turn left," right? Right. Over here is a ditch that I covered over with straw and dirt. Now, when Ricky hits it, down he goes. But what if he gets out? You're interrupting old Pete. I got a tiger tied up down there. There'll be a tiger in his tank, boobie. But what about Dee Dee? She'll be riding with Ricky. I don't like the idea of a girl being eaten by a tiger. Me, neither. It ain't nice. Don't worry, ladies. This tiger only likes boys. There's a tripwire. Here's a smokescreen, an oil slick, a fake bridge, and over here... A large painting. A farmer in a horse-drawn cart pulling a load of hay across the road. Oh, a painted murial! Yeah. Painted on paper. And Ricky goes around it and Von zipper through it. Let's see. Did I forget anything? Oh, yeah. That looks like a road, right? Right. It ain't. That's a barn with a road painted on it. And when Ricky hits it-- [smacks fist] Good-bye, farewell! And then our leader, Eric Von zipper, wins the race. You just ain't whistlin' Dixie. Now, anybody else got any ideas? Yeah. How about we just shoot this fella Ricky? Old Pete don't like that idea, boobie. That's illegal. Oh. Uh, say that again. Look, I'm going to say it one more time. I want you to listen! Now, when you get to the ditch-- the ditch, you understand me? The ditch that's covered with straw, ditch covered with straw-- what is it you do? I cross that bridge when I come to it. No, no! No, you don't. You go around it. I go around it. Right. Otherwise you're down in the pit without a pendulum. Now, listen to me. Now, what about the road signs? I change them. No! No, you don't change the road signs. No. J.D. And the rats change those. Rick, he goes the wrong way, and you go the right way, you understand? You go the right way, right? Right. Right. Now... What is it you do when you get to this road? Oh. That looks like a shortcut. I'll take it. It ain't no shortcut. It's a barn... Boobie. It's a barn boobie. Right. Then I won't take it. Good thinking, boss. Oh, that's my new image-- thanks to you, peachmont. My name is peachy. Just so your new image don't fall down into no traps, old Pete's got something else. We're going to have walkie-talkies all around, just to keep you reminded. And then you're going to have a little receiver inside your helmet where your brain's supposed to be. You know, for a low-down, good-for-nothing louse, he's a very nice fella. He's... Thanks. [Engines revving] Remember, I've got everything on the line for Von zipper to win. He'll win, chief. You have my word. If he doesn't, I'll have your key to the executive washroom. Just hang on. Who said blondes have all the fun? Hold me a little tighter. Aah! Ha ha! Only don't tickle. Oh! Are you ready? Number 14, are you ready? 111, you ready? Hey, boobie, there's a fiver if you aim that derringer at old Ricky over there. W-Wouldn't be ethical. You keep your ethicals, I'll keep my five. All right. [Gun fires] Dee Dee: Ricky, look out! [Brakes squealing] Look! Aah! No! Don't worry! It's a fake made out of paper! Pete told me all about it! [Horse whinnying] Ow! Ow! Stop it! Oh! Aah! [Motorcycle approaching] Watch out for the oil slick, boss! Watch out for the oil slick, boss! Don't talk nuts to me! Can't you see I'm busy? I didn't say anything! Ok, but don't do it no more! Whoa! Aaah! Aaah! Aah! Whoa! Oh! Oh! Let's go! Come on! Go! Let's go! Just hang on! Aah! [Tiger growling] Von zipper: Shoo, pussycat. Shoo! Shoo! [Tiger growling and Von zipper yelling "shoo"] [Pussycat meows] That's what I call an insult. Humph! Von zipper: Charge! Aaah! [Engine running underwater] [Engine running underwater] Von zipper: Come back with that bike! Where are you going? I'm the driver! Come back with that bike! Wait for me! Why me? Why me all the time? Aaah! Von zipper: Charge! [Confused shouting] [Engine running underwater] Dee Dee and Ricky: Help! Help! Let me out of here! Biker: Come on, let's hit it! Von zipper: Oh! Look out! Hang on! We're going up the hill! [Crowd cheering] Number 13, the winner. Mr. Eric Von zipper and miss Cassandra! [Everyone cheering] We now declare them "the boy and girl next door." Official: Oh, wait, no. This disqualifies Von zipper. Hold it. What do you mean that disqualifies Von zipper? What do you mean? He didn't drive across the finish line. Ah! Ah, Dee Dee and Ricky. The new boy and girl next door. [Crowd cheering] And you're the boy from nowhere. Wait a minute. She is the girl next door. Congratulations. I'm "big deal" mcpherson, and I'm running the tour you're going on, because you are the girl next door. I knew that you'd love her, b.D. Just a little added, uh, surprise. Ha ha ha! I wish she were-- I mean, the girl next door to me. If I go on the tour with you, Rick, isn't that close enough? I'll settle for that. Sorry, boss. We done our best, boobie. Ah... Forget about it. And don't feel too bad about this, young lady, because you're going to go a long ways. Farther than you think. Only--only I ain't gonna go with you 'cause-- that's what I meant. Well, 'cause I'm giving up my new image and I'm going back to my old image. Right? Right! Von zipper: The old way was better, right? Right! See, I am my ideal, but the rats are my idols. Right? Right! I'm going back to being the rat next door, right? Right! Let's go! [Muttering] [Engine still running] * after the party when the crowd starts to go * * after the party when the lights are down low * whew! * that's when I'll hold you * * just like I told you * * that's when I'll tell you * * I love you so * after the party while the night is still new * * after the party when the dancing is through * * dreams we will borrow * for our tomorrow * after the party * I'll still love you It's gonna be wonderful, Rick. Going to be? It is right now. No, I'm talking about the tour and what happens before that. What happens before that? We get married. We get marr-- you mean, uh... Uh, both of US to each other? You mean...That? Well, it's more fun that way. Yeah. * ...Dancing is through * dreams we will... I was only testing you, Rick. One of US isn't the marrying kind. You. But, uh, what about you? I'm still waiting for Frankie. But what are you waiting for? Thanks. * ...While the night is still new * bye-bye, birdie. [Penguin squawking softly] * after the party * when the dancing is through * * dreams we will borrow * for our tomorrow * after the party * I'll... [Bird squawking] Where is native girl? She prettier. Native girl come no more. My hitch is over, and I'm going home. From now on, you can squeeze your own torpedo juice. Khola koku! Squeeze. Uggh! Not him. Squeeze torpedo. Listen, bwana, I need a favor. It's an 8-day boat ride back home, and I can't wait. Can you fix me up so that I can get to the beach where Dee Dee is, like, right now? Too late. Witches' supermarket closed. Can't get ingredients for brew. I can't even get my decoy back. I think I'll leave her there. Maybe you'll like her. But I have a girl. Can't you help me? Tell daughter come here. Daughter's a real pro. They call her the witch's witch. Frankie here wants to get back to beach where Dee Dee is, like, right now. Daughter, you good kid. [Steam whistle blowing] [Boom] [After the party continues] [Squawking] Quiet! Nobody likes a big-mouth pelican. Why are you always hanging around, anyway? Frankie: Because I love you. Frankie! The bird's gone, and you're here! How-- it's magic. It I magic, that's for sure. * after the party while the night is still new * * after the party when the dancing is through * well, what do you know? This is my pad right here. You can't beat that for luck. Uh, care to see it? Why not? I've never been to Japan before. A touch of the orient. Now, my de... Oh! It's been a tough week.
