In Russia they said: Do not go by the night lake there is a mermaid waiting and as soon as you tell her the cherished "love", stupefy, tickle and tighten to the bottom. And if you resist her charms, will not forgive will separate from the one you love will torment, come at night, until she squeezes with the light. Give the most precious to her - Maybe you will be saved but no one has yet been released to the drowned women themselves because of the unhappy love died so the other true love can not see. Misha! Don't tell her, please. I am begging you. I ask... Anya ... Hurry up! Sorry. She is here. Hand, give me your hand! Give me your hand!

All the time I feel that she is near. Every time I close my eyes, I see her look. What look? Predatory, like a beast. Rum, the doctor says you are dehydrated. You just need to sleep. Are you tired. Not. That's not the point. Tell me more, where did you see her for the first time? On the lake. She was in my shirt. I was drawn to her. Yes, he raves, there was nobody there. I could not help myself. Kissed and ... I seemed to stop breathing. - Rum ... - Marina, forgive me, I could not. I could not help it. Marin. Roma, listen to me, what else do you remember?

He'll mess up now, can we get him back? We must first see one person. Hello, Dad! You gave Roma a house. What for? I didn't have to come, I'm sick. Roma saw a girl on the lake. With long hair. And now he feels bad. It is impossible, she died long ago. Do you know what it is? I do not know, leave! Father! - What happened twenty years ago? - Olya ... - Speak now! - Olya! - How did mom die? - Olya, that's enough! - Your son may die. - Leave! - I beg you, that's enough! - Say it! Stop it. Get out! “You can't hide all your life.” - She drowned. Drowned! Father! You... - Don't tell her! Don't you dare talk to her! - With whom? She will take you away! Do not dare! Do not dare! I met her at the lake. She asked: "Do you love me?" I did not answer. And she began to come to me again, torment me all the time. Your mother somehow found a way how to get rid of it. But something did not work. And she took mother. AND… No more returned. And from that day, everything has lost its meaning. Everything except her. I think about her every day. Not about mom, about her. I see her hair, eyes. I can't forget it. What exactly did mom do? I do not know. Under the old pier, under water she found something. Only it will not help you, son, she will drive you crazy. We'll see. Let's go to this damn lake. Sit down Is everything okay Twenty years have passed, but nothing has changed here. Marin, you're not mad at Kitayev? Well, he really was insane. None of your business, go dive! Yes, everything will be fine. Stay with Romka, please. A swimmer with me on the lake. So, what are you doing with it? Come, let's go, without you in any way. Do not hang! Please forgive me. We can handle, yes? We will cope with everything together. Can you bring water?

Have a drink, it will be easier. Comb, can all matter in it. "LH" ... Lisa Grigorieva. Liza... Suicide. What makes you think that she is suicidal? Suicides are not buried in cemeteries. And what, her right in the lake buried? On the shore. The lake spilled when the dam was built. So! What do we do? Liza Grigorieva ... It was not worth taking her comb. Take your thing and give me back my love. You once said that the power in the hair. Could the comb be associated with this? Your mom she conducted the rite in the bath. Maybe he will help? Rite of passage? But she did not work. This is not an option. Well, what to do? - I propose to pass the buck. - Not! She will find him everywhere. We must fight. Marin! What is rum?

Well, you, if anything, scream. I'm near. Liza Grigorieva. Take your thing and bring back your loved one! I had a dream in my childhood. I am alone in the country. Parents are gone. And suddenly I hear someone is on the street. And he orders me: "Open the door!" But I do not open. And then the door slowly opens itself. The hinges creak. The lock turns. And I am going to close the door. And on the threshold mom. She looks at me and quietly like this: "The one who stays at home one I take back! " And I am very scared. Do you love me? Love Do you hear Rum Roma, what are you doing? Take me away - Rum. - I can't take it anymore! - Rum! - Take me away! What are you doing? Enough - I cant. - Enough! Liza Grigorieva, take your thing and bring back your loved one! In childhood, my mother and I wondered so jokingly. You put two mirrors in front, and through mirrored corridor can be seen. Liza Grigorieva, take your thing and bring your lover back! Do you love me? I love more than life. - Look who's coming. - Yeah. He does not love you more! Lisa, sunshine, go, go! He promised to love more than life! He does not love you! Go away, he does not love you, he doesn't love you he doesn't love you, go away ... Killer! Quiet. Shhhh ... Quiet. Marina, Marina, Marina!
