'It's my humble appeal that we must never forget...' '...that we're Indians first, and everything else comes later.' Our differences should be well be resolved Well within the framework of our own country. 'Let us all work towards making this a reality...' '...which may then lead to more peace talks and negotiations...' '...for establishing peace and better relationships.' 'The enthusiasm and hard work of our people...' '...and their willingness to make any sacrifice for strengthening our country.' Yes, sir. How can I help? Have you got an appointment? No. No... Ambassador. Sir, you can't enter without an appointment. Ambassador...very urgent...Meeting... I told you, you are gonna have to call and set up an appointment. Russia. K...G...B What? KGB. He said KGB. Who are you? Tell me, how do we say your name? Vasili Nikitich Mitrokhin And how many years have you worked for the KGB? I was recruited in 1948 as a foreign intelligence officer. I retired in 1985, as the Director of KGB Archives. Tell me, what's in these suitcases? Secret documents. How we assassinated the Leaders. How we weakened the Economy. Everything. And how did you manage to get these documents from the KGB Archives? In his shoes. How novel. For 25 years, every day. And tell me... How many countries are in there? Almost every country. Interesting... During the Cold War, there was no free country. They were all working for the KGB or CIA. No. Not the Land bill story. I need something more meaty. Like Malda or Kerala. No... I need a real scoop. My Editor's already called twice... Hey...he's been looking for you. Sir... If you don't have a scoop for me by the end of this month... ...I'll transfer you to Art and Culture. No. Sir, not Art and Culture, please. You know, I enjoy Political Journalism... Political Journalism demands an investigative bent of mind. - Which you don't have. - The HRD Ministry canceled my interview at the last moment. Because I am too young. Nobody takes me seriously. If you manufacture your stories on fake sources... ...Then who will take you seriously? Huh? Sir, but that story was trending. It received more than a 1000 retweets and you can't deny that. This is the tragedy of the Internet age. Your story was a fake. Retweets is not how you do Political Journalism, Ragini. If there's any profession more difficult than Politics... ...then that is Political Journalism. THIS ONE! Okay. Last chance. I promise I won't let you down. I saved your skin last time, but I can't help you this time. - Sir, you have to... - Pull up your socks... ...and give me a scoop. - A real scoop. - Done. You have only 9 days, okay. Okay. Can I go? - Yes. Who cares if its Angel Investors or Evil Investors... ...but I am going ahead with my startup this year. I am done with this ethical shit, man. Moralities changes with every goddamn tweet. Who wants facts? Here, anything goes. Hello! Where's everyone? Hello. "Happy birthday to you." - Oh, God. I hate birthdays. "Happy birthday dear, Ragini." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." Hello. - "Happy birthday to you." Happy birthday, Ragini. Thanks. Who is speaking? I have a birthday gift for you. Well, I hate birthday gifts. Specially from strangers. Rahul, it's you, right? I hate pranks. I heard you're looking for a scoop. - Who isn't looking for a scoop? Well, I have one for you. And I wanted it to be my birthday gift to you... ...but, unfortunately, you don't like birthday gifts. If it's a real scoop, then I love birthday gifts. Okay Rahul, now stop it. Enough, okay. But before I give you this scoop, let's play a game. I am going to ask you some very easy questions... ...and, if you answer them correctly, the gift is all yours. Is this Mr. Bachchan from "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"? What kind of a game is this? I'm not interested in playing any game. You first tell me who you are. Who wrote, "Jana Gana Mana" (National Anthem)? Dude, everyone knows. Tagore. Full name only, please. Sorry. Rabindranath Tagore. Correct. What happened on the 26th of January? Republic Day. Okay, now stop. 15th August? Independence Day. - 20th August. 20th August... Next question. - No-no-no, wait. 20th August... Rajiv Gandhi's birthday...? 5th September? - Teacher's Day. Why? Because it's Teacher's Day. No... it's Mr. Radhakrishnan's birthday. Incomplete answer. Hey listen, now you're irritating me, okay. Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, India's 2nd President... ...who also translated the Gita, and I've read it. Now my gift or I am going. Last question. I am not going to answer any more of your questions. First you tell me who you are. 2nd October. Who is this? What happened on the 2nd of October? Mahatma Gandhi... now get lost. Hello...? Hello, you there? Hello. I am waiting for you to complete your answer. But I just answered your question. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Mahatma, Bapu, Father of the Nation... ...what else do I call him? That's an incomplete answer, Ragini. I am sorry but you lost the game. What else is on the 2nd of October? Dry Day? 2nd October. Ohh... Shit... Wait-wait-wait... It's also Shashtri's birthday. Shashtri? Lal Bahadur Shashtri, India's 2nd Prime Minister. And when did he die? I don't know. All I know is that he died in Tashkent? Yeah... Tashkent. How? I seriously don't know. Who is this? Congratulations Ragini, you passed the test. What kind of a stupid game was this? You'll find a yellow packet in your drawer. No-no-no, don't hang up. Ragini, that's your birthday gift. The scoop. "10th January 1966..." "A Historical Day." "After the Indo-Pak war in 1965..." "...and India's historic win, there was a convention held in Tashkent." "The Tashkent Agreement." "The USSR Premiere Alexi Kosygin, Pakistan's President Ayub Khan..." "...and India's 2nd Prime Minister, Mr. Lal Bahdur Shashtri met in Tashkent.' "After 6 rigorous days, the Tashkent Pact was signed on 10th January 1966" "A party was organized in the evening..." "...and Mr. Shashtri was last seen pacing around in his room." "A few hours later Mr. Shashtri died unexpectedly." "And even after 50 long years... ...we still don't know whether he died of a heart attack..." "...or whether was he poisoned." "I filed a second application..." "...and this time it was against the Foreign Ministry." "I telling them that I had already filed an application..." "...and you replied saying that the Foreign Ministry... ...still doesn't have any confirmation..." "...to which I replied how is this even possible?" "The man who died was the Prime Minister of a country..." "...I am sure the Ambassador must be going nuts." "As soon as the news of the Prime Minister's death..." "would've broken out the phones wouldn't have stopped ringing off the hook." "Telegrams sent all across..." "There must be a plethora of paper trail between Moscow and Delhi." "You'll be flying the Prime Minister's body from there to here..." "...and what system are they going to follow? What will be the arrangements?" "And all these points have to be documented." "How can you say that you have no supporting documents ?" "That's when they said that under the RTI Clause of the National Security..." "...we cannot disclose this information to you." Ragini. What is all this? Lal Bahadur Shashtri's mysterious death. All this information relating to his death is available in the public domain. It runs over 5000 pages. But what does our government have relating to Mr. Shashtri's death? Just this. Nothing. Lal Bahadur Shashtri? - Yeah... Our generation is least interested in him. It's not about Shashtri, let's pin down the government. Lal Bahadur Shashtri was the 2nd Prime Minister of independent India... ...who died in Tashkent. When? Immediately after the war. Thousands of suspicious, and doubts were raised. Some claimed that he was poisoned, some said he had a heart attack. But over 50 years do we have concrete information? No. Nothing. There's no proof to corroborate that he was poisoned. Who cares? Okay, sorry. But we need a scoop, and we have a scoop. And sir, this time I've brought authentic paperwork... ...with the seal of the Government of India. As supporting evidence, I have Anuj That's RTIs and also his statement. I've already run it with legal, and they said it's okay. No media. Aditya Raj invited Home Minister PKR.. - I said no media. ...Natrajan for a meeting over the questions... - I said no media. ...raised on Lal Bahadur Shashtri case. - I said no media. We can't say much about closed rooms... ...but we're definitely going to debate over this issue today. Stop them. Did Shashtri die or was he murdered? This question is a slap on the face of our country... ...which no government over the last 50 years has tried to find an answer to. What is the government trying to hide from us? What conspiracy lurks behind Mr. Shashtri's death? We're going to organize a nationwide protest to find answers. Yes! Yes We Will! We won't rest or, neither let anyone rest. Mr. Shashtri gave us the slogan... ...of "Jai Jawan, Jai Kishan" (Hail the soldier, Hail the farmer). But what is the slogan of this government? "Hail Satan, Hail Evil?" Mr. Shashtri's files should be made public. "Yes, we demand they are made public!" - Mr. Shashtri's files... - Must be reopened...! - Mr. Shashtri's files... - Must be reopened...! 27th May, 1964. After the death of Pt. Nehru... ...the president of Congress, and Syndicate leader K. Kamaraj became active again. And he was facing the responsibility... ...of choosing the next leader of our country. And the breaking news of the hour... ...is that opposition leader Mr. Shyamsunder Tripathi will be going on a hunger strike. How can you expect anything to change if the leaders of our country go on a hunger strike? You need to rest. When I'll have no power, there's not much that blood pressure can do. Sit. Sit. How did Mr. Shashtri become the PM after Pt. Nehru? He wasn't even a candidate Morarji Desai was the most senior... ...and a deserving candidate for PM. So who was the kingmaker there? Kamaraj, remember? No. I don't know. Kumaraswamy Kamraj. And after Mr. Shashtri's death, Morarji Desai should have been the next PM. But it was Indra Gandhi instead. Kamaraj again. Everyone remembers the Kings. Not the kingmakers. 'Mr Shastri's agenda has taken a new turn.' 'What's the agenda of Minister Natarajan' 'and Shyam Sunder Tripathi's meeting?' 'Is it finding the truth behind Lal Bahadur Shastri's death' 'or to reach some sort of agreement?' It's all rather rich. Just a little... Here you go... - No-no...fried objects are... Mr. Natrajan, it's made in pure ghee, with potatoes. It won't even make a dent. Well, if you insist... Thank you. I am curious... What's your benefit in forming a committee? Because you know very well that I cannot be influenced. There are only two copies of this report. One in Justice Shah's office, and the other one...is this. The final report will only be drafted when my Ministry issues a statement. So the disciple wants to blackmail his mentor. Is that a yes? Hear that? I'm not the only one in this mess, you are too. You cannot budge without my approval. This committee will have 8 members. Four from each side. And of course, you with the Veto power. You've pretty good experience on how to handle those 8 members. Oh yes... There will be no media coverage or video recording. What a dilemma... We're doing everything for Mr. Shashtri... ...but no one's talking about him. What was the name of that journalist? Hi... Good morning... - Good morning. Good morning... - Good morning. Mr. Tripathi... Mr. Tripathi... Ohh... Well, you're pretty young. Come, sit. You may have guessed why I called you over. If a politician sends flowers to a journalist and invites her over... ...then it's definitely something big. You're more mature than you look. Nevertheless, let's get to the point. How would you like to do it? Cash? Favor? Or both? Depends. What's the offer? Why are you so interested in Mr. Shashtri? I am only interested in the truth. In Politics, nothing is what it seems. And that's the truth. Well sir, if you want that I don't write anything related to Lal Bahadur Shastri's death... ...then let me tell you that... I...am... ...proposing your name. My name? It's absolutely crucial for a journalist to be on the committee... ...and you've done extensive research on this subject. You're young, intelligent, and a woman at that. Here... What's the real motive? You know, Natrajan believes in cameras. Whereas I respect the human eye and intelligence. And you have both. I want you to be my camera in the committee. Meaning you're more concerned about your image in the media. It's the only thing a politician has. Politics is a battlefield. People are not interested in the truth... ...only the stories of truth. Sir...I am an amateur journalist, and your ambitions are too big for me. Journalism is yet another name for Politics. I heard that you're looking for funding for your news site. Did Lal Bahadur Shashtri die of a heart attack... ...or was it a conspiracy? The Tripathi Committee will conduct an investigation. And the head of this committee is Mr. Shyam Sunder Tripathi. Would you like to shed some more light on the Tripathi Committee? Sir...Sir... Ex-RAW Chief...GKF Anand Suresh. That's Ananthsuresh with an 'H'. One word. Sorry, sir. The youth leader of the ruling party, Mr. Vishvendra Pratap Singh. ...is this committee just an excuse to bury this question? So you don't trust the RAW. Sir...Sir... Ex-Judge of Supreme Court, Retired Justice Kurien Abraham. Sir, do you think that Mr Shasti was poisoned?' Ma'am, I'll open the doors in the next couple of minutes. Thank you. Do you have a matchstick? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. The Director of Archives India, Mr. Omkar Kashyap as well. Renowned Social Worker, who also runs many NGOs... ...and a strong opposer of the government, Indira Joseph Roy. Of course... How can anything go wrong as long as I am here. The Director of Indian Research Council, Mr. Gangaram Jha. Renowned Historian and an expert on Mr. Shashtri, Padmashri Ayesha Ali. The most controversial selection, which is said to be a last minute decision. What do you think you're doing? Turn it off. Aren't their heaters in the room? They don't work. I've already informed Maintenance crew. That settles it then. Let things continue the way they are. Sir, ma'am, please deposit your mobile phones with me. Mobile phones are not allowed in here. Where? There. Do you know for a fact, Ms. Ayesha, that... I am a historian, and I know more than you think. Oh, Hello. Oh, shit. Yeah... shit. Thank you. Cigarette? No thanks, Kashyap. Why? I know for a fact that everyone in RAW smokes. Smoking is not allowed. Yeah, I know. Smoking is not allowed. - Thank you. God bless. Excuse me, are phones allowed in here? I'll deposit it. Because I still don't use a mobile phone. By the way, I am The Omkar Kashyap. Retired Director, Archives. Okay. Hello, I am Ragini Phule. So you're the reason why we all gathered here. Good morning everybody. Good morning, Mr. Shyam. - Good morning... Take a seat everyone. Omkar Kashyap. Omkar Kashyap. Okay... Someone's missing. The quorum is complete, we can start the meeting. Is the quorum complete? - Yes, sir. Sorry-Sorry-Sorry... My flight took off late from Bombay. - Mumbai. Yeah, I know Mumbai...for me, it will always remain Bombay. I can't even pronounce Delhi for that matter. Actually, I had a keynote address at the World Science Congress. The relevance of Common Sense in the Age of Artificial Intelligence. But we've gathered here today to talk about Mr. Shashtri. Oh... Sir... Sir... Hello. You may begin the discussion... ...because it will come to a conclusion on its own. And why do you say that? Sir, rumors. And what is the lifespan of a rumor? Rumors. - Yes. You mean this committee was formed on the basis of rumors. That's your opinion. Sir, we cannot ignore common sense. I believe we'll reach a decision by lunchtime. Then we can all go down to North Block... ...and have some South Indian food. You seem to be in a bit of a hurry. Have you made reservations as well? No, no, I've studied the case. It's quite simple. There's nothing to it. No documents, no proof, no logic. Wastage of public money. It's as simple as ABCD. I don't think it's as simple as ABCD. Unless of course, maybe you know something that we don't. For example...ABCD. Please... The Agenda is on everyone's monitor. Information and Facts. Go through them. We'll focus on every aspect. Hear the witness. And if anyone has a witness who has more information... ...then you can recommend their names as well. But sir, the registration for witnesses have already closed. I have extraordinary powers, son. If we believe that he has some unique information... ...then we won't just admit it, but also summon them. But only if we have a majority. We won't waste our time on hearsay. Those of us who think that Mr. Shashtri's death was a natural one, meaning he died of a heart attack... ...please raise your hand. Mr. Roy. Why did you lower your hand? Mr. Vishvendra, when there are so many suspicions revolving around the death of a Prime Minister... ...then don't you feel there should be some debate over it. By the way, this committee's been formed to investigate his death... ...but let's talk about his personal life first. He was only 16 years old, you know. At the age of 16, he took part in Gandhiji's Satyagraha movement. And before that, when he was only 12... ...he stopped using Shrivastav, which was his family name because he was strongly against the caste system. Post his marriage, he asked his wife Lalita to wear Khadi... ...and his wife complied without any objection. He was a true Gandhian. And at the time of his death, he had only one car... ...which he bought with a government-sanctioned loan. And yes, not to forget that he defeated Pakistan. What does that prove? When did I say it proves anything? I remember... I was 20-year-old... During the war, Mr. Shashtri would visit the borders, meet with the soldiers. "If someone tries to threaten the sanctity of our country using guns or bombs..." "...then as your leader, our best reply would be that we fight the enemy using their own weapon." It's a known fact that good people die early. By the way, he was an old man when he died. 62 61... He was 61. Okay. But people have died at 58, right? Ronald Reagan was 69 when he became President. Absolutely. And our Prime Minister Mr. Morarji Desai... became the Prime Minister at the age of 81. Age is just numbers. But Shashtri was a great man, brave man. All these discussions are irrelevant. Prime Minister was a brave man... ...but that doesn't mean that he had a strong heart too. If we can access his medical records, ECG, BP records from before 11th January... But all that is normally recorded in the Doctor's diary... ...which the government doesn't have. oh, please... - What please, Ananth? But it's a fact that Mr. Shashtri suffered a heart attack prior to this. Twice, sir. Twice. Case closed, let's go get something to eat. Isn't it true that the hotel Where he was supposed to stay... ...was changed at the last moment and was asked to stay at a 'Dancha' instead. The word 'Dancha' is Russian for a bungalow. Professor, case reopened. The fact is that for the Prime Minister's stay... ...a DIG from the Central Government had flown to Tashkent to approve of it. The hotel had a stairway... Bad for a heart patient. But there were none in the 'Dancha'. Hence 'Dancha'. According to what I had read, what the DIG had approved... ...was not a Dancha, but an in-tourist hotel instead. I repeat... in-tourist hotel. With a provision of a makeshift operation theatre and oxygen in its ground floor. Exactly two days earlier, due to the intervention of a doctor and a high-ranking officer from Moscow... ...the PM's stay was shifted from the hotel and moved to this Dancha. And his staff was put up 11 kilometers away from the site. Excuse me. 250 yards. Not 11 kilometers, sir. There was no operation theatre or oxygen in that Dancha. Isn't that true? - Unbelievable. A Prime Minister who is a heart patient... ...and has already suffered two heart attacks, has no oxygen tank in his room. There is something called as an official protocol. Sir, please, with your permission... ...I would just like to read out the facts. After his return from reception to the residence... ...Lal Bahadur Shashtri was in normal health, and was in a good mood... ...and spoke over the telephone with his relatives in Delhi. He went to bed at about 12:30 midnight, on the 11th of January. At about 1:20 in the morning... ...Mr. Sahai, Kapoor, and Sharma approached the Prime Minister's doctor... ...who was in the room next to him and told him that the Prime Minister was feeling unwell. Dr. Chug at once approached the Prime Minister who was sitting on his bed coughing... ...and was complaining of lack of breath. The doctor put the Prime Minister in a reclining position... ...and gave him an intra-muscular injection. Within the next three minutes, Prime Minister Shashtri lost consciousness, pulse disappeared... ...breathing stopped and heartbeats could not be heard. The death occurred at 1:32 in the morning of 11th January, 1966. After which 6 more doctors arrived on the spot... ...followed by a lady doctor by the name of Yerenko. Yeremenko, sir. Right, Yeremenko. They all arrived on the scene, examined the patient... ...and declared that Mr. Shashtri was no longer breathing. Back then two reports were made. One report was handed to the Indian Government. And the other, to the existing Soviet government There is one fact which we all are missing. How can we miss anything as long as you're here, Ms. Indira? A very important point which even...historians missed out on. Mr. Shashtri's room...had no bell. No buzzer. - No bell...no buzzer. What? - Wait a minute. My common sense is saying that there's something wrong here. There is no problem. There is no problem. There is no problem. All of you have a copy of the reports, correct? Please check your medical records. Every doctor has cited. Where is the argument? This report contains signatures of 6 doctors excluding Dr. R.N. Chug. But there were a total of 8 doctors. Sir... - Yes... Sir, everyone's signatures are right here... ...but the Home Minister and Foreign Minister admitted in the Parliament... ...that Senior Dr. E.G. Yeremenko arrived on the spot first. Then why isn't her signature on the document? Is it possible that she refused to sign? Maybe because she had a doubt. Why are you asking stupid questions? Sir, I think she is on the committee, she should be allowed to make her point. Sir, point no. 2 is why wasn't Mr. Shashtri given oxygen. There's no mention of oxygen. It's written in the report. The report clearly mentions that he was given oxygen. No, ma'am. Excuse me, sir. It states here that he was administered an intramuscular injection, artificial respiration, and massage. But there's no mention of an intubular oxygen... ...which is compulsory for a heart patient who has already suffered two heart attacks. Maybe he wasn't given oxygen because there was none... Sir, sir, just a minute. How could I not see this? Common sense. It says here Mr. Shashtri was administered Intramuscular injection Mefthantine sulfate 15mg... ...whereas his heart had already stopped beating and blood pressure was nil. In such conditions doctors give intra-venus injections. In layman's term, the injection is administered in the veins... ...so that the medicine reaches the system immediately and starts showing effects. Whereas, Mr. Shashtri was given an intramuscular injection. So that the medicine reaches the system late. May I ask? Did the doctor not know such a common thing in medical science? Or was it intentional? Could it be possible that Mr. Shashtri was already dead and the injection was administered later? And that's why Dr. E.G. Yeremenko refused to sign. Sir, one should have some prima facia evidence to support this hypothesis. Right. - Maybe evidence was made to disappear. Or burnt, what else. No, no, no, I take strong objection to this, sir. Of course, you do. By the way, Mr. Vishvendra, we all know your history pretty well. Oh, madam, we all know your history as well... ...but let's not get into that right now. Please. This is your problem. This is your problem... It's an old habit of yours. Taking things off records. Which is why we don't have proper records. What do you mean by us? Politicians. They have ruined this country. Objection. I take objection on this statement. Even I am a politician. By the way, even your father-in-law was in politics. From her first marriage. No, no, no... That is misogynistic. No, no, no... That is misogynistic. I take offense to that. It's not allowed. I will say what I want to say. That is the point. No, I don't care. Congratulations, Ragini You've already become a celebrity. Come on, sir. Zee News called for a Prime Time Talk show. They want to invite you, not me. For the Prime Time Talk show. I fought for you, for this article. Risked my job. Thank you very much. Okay guys, let's roll. 5...4...3...2...1... Go. Hello. Ragini, this issue was long forgotten. All the debates have been done. So why dig up old graves now? Old graves... Asking questions about the death of the 2nd Prime Minister of Independent India, Mr. Lal Bahadur Shashtri... ...and demanding the truth is digging up old graves for you? Not for me. Do you believe you're the messiah of truth? Bloody TV reporter. Is it true that you had only a week... ...and since it's impossible to do an investigative story in a week... ...you got desperate. And to save your job, you just went on Google, searched conspiracy theories... That's called research. It's my job... And you found a new story. This is called fake news. Answer me, why did you do this? Why did you do this? Tell me. Ragini, why did you do this? What do you want? I just want the truth to be out there. Don't we have any right to the truth? Stop this truth. Huh Kaiser, what is this stupid girl thinking? That we're afraid of the truth. Only idiots are afraid of the truth. One should be afraid of rumours. Rumours. Because if rumours are not stopped in time... ...then it can even defy the truth. What is this cover-up? Don't we have a right to know the truth? We want to know what happened with Mr. Shashtri. Was it a heart attack, or was it... Or was it a state sponsored murder. What is this girl's agenda? Hello, Mr. Unknown Caller. Congrats, Ragini. Congrats. Thank you. The interview was sensational. - Thank you. Demanding for a committee was a real trump card. Now you are a star journalist. No, I am not a star journalist. I am a nobody. But I want to meet you, and I want to thank you. Whoever you are, sir, I want to meet you. Nobody? Then why are all eyes on you? All eyes are on me? Look outside. Outside? Outside... from the balcony. How do you know someone's outside my house. Hello. Am I being watched? Am I under surveillance. Tell me. Who is watching me? Are there cameras in my house? Tell me goddamnit. I know how this works. I know... Talk to me. If you're real then show yourself. Ragini, you just passed level two of this game. To hell with your game! Ragini, do you know any cricket star... ...who retired after making a single century because he was scared of facing bouncers? Or a film star, who rejected a role. Did you come all the way to Delhi from Pune to score a single century? 99 is not a century, Ragini. This is a war. And you cannot stop after a single victory. Who are you? Your source. You can't be just source. What do you know? Why are you after me? Why me? - Because I want you to win, Ragini. Because no one pays heed to losers. Have a good night, Ragini. I wish you all the best, Ragini. "Day after day..." "...my hopes die with me." "Missing..." "...is my conscience inside me." "And what about the God..." "...that's supposed to alleviate our sorrows." "Why are humans still losing." "My self-respect is gone. I keep on falling." "I am at loss of words." "I am at loss of words." "Everything goes." "Everything goes." "Everything goes." "Everything goes." "Everything goes." "Everything goes." It's true that Mr. Shashtri's medical reports were buried. Is it also true that one of the medical doctors refused to sign on that report? That's what my ex-boss told me. Who ex-boss? The great editor Bakshi, sir. Bakshi... I want to meet him. Where is he? God knows where Bakshi sir is. - Why? He just vanished. Disappeared. But sir, there must be some lead. Something. I want to crack this. Please help me out. He had an entire file on Mr. Shashtri's medical report. Yeah... Given to him by an Indian spy. Spy? That he was a KGB mole. And KGB claimed that he was a RAW mole. Here... And he died in a cylinder blast in one of Moscow's factories. Disclaimed. And then, two years ago someone spotted him in Tashkent. Mukhtar. Yes. This will help. Thank you so much, sir. You've been a great support. Ragini... I don't know how to do this. The Management thinks that you should resign. I am there whenever you need help. "Everyone's fallen asleep." "Some are awake." "Everyone has a reason..." "It's all unreasonable." "Everything goes." "Everything goes." "Everything goes." Something definitely happened with you. What happened on 10th January? What is the truth? Please help me out. Please... "Whose blood has frozen in his veins." "Everyone has a reason..." "It's all unreasonable." Hello. "Everything goes." "Everything goes." Akbar? I am doing a research on Lal Bahadur Shashtri. Do you recognise this man? Akbar! Akbar! Who are you? What do you know about Lal Bahadur Shashtri's death? Who do you work for? The truth. Don't try to sound naive. Do you know who you're up against? These are International secret agents. You'll disappear from the face of earth before you even realize... Forever. Save your life and run. Run! Was it CIA? Then why did you burn yourself twice, Mukhtar? What do you know that you're always on the run, always hiding. This was during the Cold War. America was spreading Democracy and Capitalism all over the world... ...and USSR was spreading socialism and communism. See... This is the Iron Curtain. All the countries on this side were allies with the US. And the countries on this side were with the USSR. And this Cold War was not between some armies... ...it was being run by two secret agencies. CIA and KGB. 1970s. It was the era of spies. And India was the most important country for both of them. The CIA's philosophy was if you want to enslave any country... ...then just buy them with money. But the KGB believed that if you control people's mind, then they will become your slave. But this was not possible as long as Mr. Shashtri was alive. So what is the truth about Mr. Shashtri? Truth. When I joined the secret agency, I learned the most interesting art. The art...of disappearing. People... Items... Documents... just like that. See... And...even the truth. Opponents, intellectuals, leaders, witnesses, whistle-blowers, professors. I made them disappear at the blink of an eye. Riots, assassinations, coos, unrest, everything. Documents, governments, facts, figures, spies, truth... All that was a cinch for me. I thought I was God. We are nothing. Nothing... Someone else is pulling the strings. Who? You can't see him. He has no whereabouts. But we all dance to his tunes. Almost like a God. What do you think? When people like me couldn't find him, someone like you can. I am not a coward like you. Have you ever heard that two medical reports were made for the same dead person. "He always carried a red diary..." "...which was not amongst his belongings." "He used to record day-to-day events in it." "My mother also stated that we never received the flask either..." "...which he used to drink milk or water from, for the last time." Even Mrs. Lalita gave the same statement... ...during her interview with Dharmayug. Dharmayug was a weekly Hindi magazine. And its editor was Dharamver Varti. Why was Mr. Shashtri pointing towards the flask? Was he asking for water? Water or milk? The real question is what were the contents of that flask? Shashtri sir used to regularly take a laxative at night. And as always, his attendant served him milk in the flask. It's all recorded in my book. Agreed. His attendant served him milk in the flask. But the flask was lying flat... Meaning it was empty. Whatever its content, milk or water... ...was already consumed. Could Mr. Shashtri have been trying to say... ...that his condition was due to drinking the contents of the flask? Did it contain poison? Why the flask? Poison can also be in the air. That's your job to find out. You are the historian. No, no, this is not a laughing matter. Look here, Jha. Every Historian's job is to record the events... ...and not reshape it according to our convenience. And every historical fact is being restructured. The flask was straight or lying flat. What was the angle of the flask? How does it all matter? How does it matter if the PM was pointing towards it? A man who's experiencing a heart attack could be wading his hand in any direction. Common Sense? Historians have been doing their research for over 50 years... ...but no one raised such questions before. How far was the Dancha? Did they have oxygen or not? How does the content of the flask make any difference? Everyone agrees that he suffered a heart attack. Yes... - Here we go again. Here we go again. If everyone agreed, then why was this committee formed in the first place. What are we all doing here? - I don't know, you tell me. The question should have been that... ...why weren't the contents of the flask sent for a forensic investigation? How could they, Ananth? Because the flask went missing. Same as the doctor's diary. So the question that arises is... ...what happened to his personal diary? Why do you look at me every time you have a doubt in your mind? Sir, what does lack of evidence point to? Look Kashyap, lack of evidence cannot be evidence itself. Absolutely. - Exactly my point. You come back to that same... Cool down. Calm down. - The question is whether there was reasonable doubt. Calm down. - He's the most experienced. Why aren't we asking him? - Calm down. Yelling and screaming will not lead to anything. It's not the solution. Well, at least we all agree that the medical report is correct... ...and we have no other evidence to prove it wrong. Which medical report, sir? What? Which medical report, sir? Indian or Soviet? What difference does it make? - What do you mean? There is... We were told the Indian and Soviet were each given a medical report. Identical. Same to same. - Yes... But that information is wrong. Because they were not identical. Because one report states that it can be considered... ...that the death was due to an acute attack of infark-myocardio. Whereas the other report states that it may be considered... ...that the death was caused by the myocardial infarction. How can that be identical? - My God, what is all this? Could be a spelling mistake or a translation error or something. if these reports were identical, then how can there be a mistake? Exactly my point, thank you. Thank you, sir. Look here, sir. One report states that he was given glucose, adrenalin, and potassium chloride. The other report states that he was given glucose, adrenalin, and calcium chloride. So, isn't there a difference between potassium chloride and calcium chloride? Yes, they are two different things. Rumors. Just baseless rumors. Let me tell you. The words for potassium and calcium are very similar in Russian. 'Cali' means Potassium and 'Calci' means Calcium. So the guy who translated the Russian report... ...translated 'Calci' wrong, and he wrote potassium, whereas it should've been Calcium. Okay, ma'am. Then tell me this... Only 6 Soviet doctors signed the report prepared by the Indian doctor Dr. Chug. But exactly 3 days later when the Soviet report was prepared... ...it was signed by 8 Soviet doctors. Two more doctors signed this report. - That is a point. And one of them was... - Dr. Shamirzen. Dr. Shamirzen. And the other was... Yes...Dr. EG Yeremenko. The senior doctor who arrived on the spot first. And when she couldn't revive Mr. Shashtri... When Premiere Kosygin asked Yeremenko why she couldn't revive him... ...she stated this... "That would be possible if death due to heart failure." Revival would've been possible only if Mr. Shashtri had died of a heart attack. That means she was out-and-out in doubt... ...which is why she signed the report which as doubtful. What is the source of your information? Same place you should have. Fake news writers don't have any sources. Oh, Ayesha ma'am... You know ma'am when you were honored with the Padmashri in 2012... ...I was the first to congratulate you on Twitter. Thank you very much. But that doesn't mean that you're the only one who writes books on history. Are you two on Twitter? Come on, Jha. Everything I said...is available on this book. It's all mentioned here. Malkani. K.R. Malkani. The Governor of Pondicherry. Sir is it possible, during the Parliament proceedings on 16th February, 1966... ...the foreign minister Swaran Singh gave a statement included the medical report. But when a copy of the same procedure was published... ...the medical reports were missing. Why? Maybe they forgot to add it. Anyone can make a mistake. Sir, mistake in the parliament - No, no, no... proceeding... That is an important point, we cannot ignore it. When the government has systematically ignored Mr. Shashtri... ...then this doesn't make a point at all? Excuse me, Ms. Roy. What do you mean by "systematically ignore"? I think there's nothing left to debate over this issue. And yet... Yet...if you believe that we should continue... I mean continue debating over it, then raise your hand. Sir, your honor. Why did you raise your hand? After everything, I heard and read here... ...I am convinced that there is something fishy about Mr. Shashtri's death. Yes...sure of that. Imran, what do you know about Mr. Shastri? He was an honest and a great Prime Minister. Won the war against Pakistan. But if the war had not happened... Sit... Sit. But if the war had not happened in the first place... ...he would still be an honest Prime Minister. But would he still be a 'Great' PM... ...if he hadn't died that night in Tashkent? People forget one's mistakes and weaknesses... ...after a single victory. No one remembers that there was a no-confidence motion against Mr. Shashtri in the Parliament. And it was Vijaylalaxmi Pandit who brought it in motion. She had said that the Minister and his Colleagues had become prisoners of Indecision. But all these people remember is his victory. If this girl succeeds... ...no one will remember that she writes fake news. Everything all right, Imran? She meets with a traitor in Tashkent... and no one bothers to inform me. You said that you can handle your wife. I mean your ex-wife. "All father said was what is the news." "To which he replied that the people seem angry..." "...how you can sign the Tashkent Declaration?" "But father replied with a smile..." "...there is nothing to be worried about." "Let me return to my country..." "When I tell them the real reason..." "...I am sure the entire country will side with me." As a son, I have a big question... What was that important piece of news father had? Was it a big secret? Could that secret be this? Fake news. Ms. Ayesha, back in those days... ...there were no fake news or Photoshop. This is a common conspiracy theory. That Mr. Shashtri and Netaji Bose had a secret meeting in Tashkent. Oh, come on, Shyam. Bose died in an air crash in 1945. Shashtri went to Tashkent in 1966. Look at the gap? 21 years. No, no, Netaji didn't die in a plane crash. He was alive. This is just a story that was sold to this country... ...and we all know who sold it to us. Yes, even I believe that Netaji did come to India, but secretly. Wonderful. Next, you will talk about Gumnami Baba as well. Who is Gumnami Baba? After Netaji went missing... ...Netaji Bose came to Ayodhya disguised as Gumnami Baba. It's mentioned in Justice Shah's report. This definitely proves that we didn't gather here to know the truth... ...but to create a mythology. Thank God, ma'am. At least we're not writing mythology in the name of history. Excuse me. Ms. Ayesha, Dr. Homi.J. Bhabha... ...who was given charge of India's Nuclear Program by Mr. Shashtri... ...his plane crashes in the Alps, exactly 13 days after Mr. Shashtri's death. Is this just a coincidence? No. It was an accident. Really? Sir, I've something to show all of you. This book... called Conversations with the Crew. A high ranking CIA officer Robert Crowley gave an interview to Gregory Douglas. I am going to read out a small, but important snippet of this interview. During the interview, Douglas asked him who are these jokers. Who are they? And Crowley replied that he doesn't exist anymore. And his name was Bhabha. And when Bhabha was traveling to Vienna, on a 747 Boeing airplane Plane... ...when an explosion occurred in the plane's cargo section. The plane, it's passengers and crew, disappeared. Crowley even says here that there as no real evidence and the world was a much safer place. Oh, come on, Kashyap. What rubbish. The death of one Bha Bha made the world a much safer place. Dr. Homi... Dr. Homi Bhabha. One Bhabha... Whatever! But we're talking about America, the biggest country in the world. And their CIA was forced to kill one of our scientists, to make the world a safer place. Device a conspiracy on such a large scale? Are you serious? They could've rigged his car with explosives... ...or killed him in the park or even drugged his sweets for god sakes. Anything... - What a coincidence... Unbelievable. Same question. Identical. As you said, sir. Identical. Douglas asked Crowley the same question. And do you know what Crowley replied... The cow-loving, ragged-looking, stupid leader... ...had come pretty close to building a nuclear bomb, with the help of Bhabha. And it had become crucial for us to get him out of the way. And we got rid of that cow-loving, ragged looking, leader and Bhabha at the blink of an eye. So sir... who according to the CIA was that cow-loving, ragged-looking, stupid leader? It was the 2nd Prime Minister of India Mr. Lal Bahadur Shashtri. And let me read out Crowley's exact lines to you. This is what he wrote. Here... "We knocked up Bhabha and nailed Shashtri!" We knocked up Bhabha and nailed Shashtri? Yes... What is this? Some kind of video game? Bloody capitalists. Imperialistic cold-blooded murderers, savages. Make the rich, richer and the poor, poorer. That's it. And what do we do? We give them the red carpet treatment. In the name of Globalisation, and liberalization. My foot. This is just a scam with the population of our country... ...to make them slaves to American Corporate Culture. You know, Globalisation is just another word for Corporate Slavery. They won't use their guns on us... ...but rather kill us with their burgers, and fries, and Colas. You know we need to end this capitalism before it ends us all. Socialism must have claimed at least 60 million innocent lives. Crowley was lying. Oh really... - The book is right in front of you... Forget the book. He was a retired man... Anyone can make any number of claims after leaving the CIA. You just use the facts that suit your story. Why would anyone lie about such a prominent figure in the world? Do you have any logic for this? - Identity. Recognition. After retiring, a person loses his powers as well as his identity. And in order to gain it back, ...they can go to any lengths. Anything at all. Even resort to lying. Yes... What is your password? You can't be here. You've changed it. You're forgetting the court orders, Imran? You can't be within a 500-meter radius of my house. You can't be within a 5-meter radius of my Minister. I'm going to call the Police. Call the police, huh. Let things continue the way they are. You're never going to win this game. Understand. So stop it. And what if I don't. There will be consequences for obstructing our path. Coming from the man who once said that he will protect me. You're not that woman anymore. You've never been a man. Natrajan's dog. The Police are going to stay with you 24/7. As long as you're under threat. "They don't believe" "what you say, Radha." "...what you say, Radha." "...what you say, Radha." Welcome. Welcome. - Welcome, sir. Welcome. Happy Anniversary. - Thank you. Thank you very much. How's the inquiry coming? Well, ...they've made a union. Is there a nut that wouldn't crack? We can swing Indira to our side... ...if the Tax-inquiry against her NGO is withdrawn. Please help yourself. Hello. Hi, ma'am. "...what you say, Radha." A talk needs to be had with the committee. Yeah, I've been waiting all... Ma'am? Stop. Mr. Natrajan What the hell. What are you doing here? To meet Mr. Natrajan. - No, you're not meeting anyone. No, I've to meet him... - You're not meeting anyone. Imran... Imran... I have invited her. Can I get you something to drink? Why aren't you killing me? My dear, we go by Law. Why are you scared if you haven't done anything wrong? Even evil-doers are never afraid of anyone. Who are you talking about? The people who killed Mr. Shashtri. aYour Committee is conducting an investigation about it. Committee. It's just a farce, like a reality show. Everything is scripted and staged. Their agenda isn't finding the truth, but to create a lie... ...because none of you have the courage to face the truth... Oh come on, let's not talk about courage. Courage is not about speaking in front of the camera, but staying silent. ...to decide what's right and what's not for the population of 1.25 billion people. ...to sacrifice your provisions for the greater good. ...and to abstain from speaking the truth, even though you know it. A country that's caught up in its past can never progress. One needs the courage to detach from the past. Past... One can forget the past, but not run from it. Because someday it comes face-to-face, as it will happen in this case. And that day we'll talk about courage again. Are you trying to threaten me? No, sir. I am informing you that I reject your Police protection. Because this isn't about Mr. Shashtri anymore... ...but the right of a citizen. My right to truth. Ragini Phule has denied Police protection. She mentioned in her Facebook post that she is being pressurized... ...to mislead the committee's findings. There were too many coincidences in this case... ...like Dr. Chug meeting with an accident, where he and his wife died. And there was no inquiry ordered. Even Ramnath, his personal assistant... ...met with an accident once, where he survived. But then he met with another accident, which happened right here in Janpath... ...that left him crippled. Later he passed away. There were only two witnesses in Lal Bahadur Shashtri's case. His personal assistant, Ramnath. And the other was Dr. Chug. Both of them, coincidentally, died in an accident... ...on two separate days, of course. Two witnesses. And they both died. Again... No witnesses, no case... Nothing! Striking coincidence. Even science and common sense can't find an answer to this. What would you call it? It's...exactly like fiction. Life is fiction, Indira. I know, but we're here to find the truth, aren't we? But truth is a luxury, my dear. This is why some cases never get solved. Jeep case, money-laundering, chopper-scam, cash-for-vote scam. Bellari Mining case, Telgi case, Truth is indeed a luxury in our country. There are a couple of other luxuries you forgot to mention. Lalit Narayan Mishra's murder. Shama Prasad Mukherjee. Deen Dayal Upadhyay case. CWG, 2G, Union Carbide, Bofors. Even Gumnami Baba. Kashyap, don't look at me. It's the handiwork of people like you. - Please, sir. It's very irritating. Intelligence Agencies always submit detailed evidence. We all know who makes them disappear. When the jury tries hostile witnesses or cases with missing evidence ... ...then there's nothing much they can do. Sir. Are you trying to say that all the witness related to Mr. Shashtri's case were murdered... ...and all evidence, documents went missing. Behave yourself, young girl. Behave yourself! I never said that. No, I never said it. Sir, I don't think she meant to insult you. We...we're not going to record any of this. And you... Come here. You will not say anything like this ever again. India is not an autocracy... ...its a successful democracy in the world. - Democracy. - Yes. - Really? - Yes... Maybe that's why no one from my generation knows that the Nuclear program, Green revolution... ...White revolution, the fact that India is a world leader in milk production... ...was started by Mr. Shashtri. Mr. Shashtri was the first Economic reformer of India. And no one knows this. And there's another thing I want to tell all of you. Not as Indira Joseph Roy... ...but as a mother. It's so shameful, that even my son is unaware... ...that 2nd of October is also Mr. Shashtri's birthday. That's your democracy, sir. This is your education system. I have the least doubt in my mind that we killed Mr. Shashtri twice. First in Tashkent, and then we systematically erased him from the memory of this country. Sir, I've been observing that... ...the motive of some people here is not to find the truth. They want to play politics. Dirty politics. How... How can we forget what Mr. Shashtri did for our country? How can we erase him from our heart and mind? Because this is a country of truth and non-violence. This is a country of Gandhi and Nehru. Why not Shashtri's? What? What did you say? Why not Shashtri's? Enough! How dare you? This is entirely... How dare you? Do you know who I am... Who do you think you are? - Please stop him. Sit down. Who are you? Who do you think you are? You think... Do you know who I am? Do you know where I come from? - Mr. Rana... Please... Hello. - Ragini, I found out. KP Bakshi, veteran journalist. Bakshi wrote a report stating the Secret Service had some connection with Shashtri's death. CIA? - I don't know. If KP Bakshi signs up as a witness, that will seal everyone's mouth. Don't be impatient, Ragini. Bakshi will contact you, himself. But until then you should study Lal Bahadur Shashtri's body. That will be your level 3. "When we saw his dead body at the airport..." "...we noticed that his face had turned blue." "And later, when we spoke to some cardiologists, some very renowned cardiologists..." ...they confirmed that the white spots on his temple, are conclusive with either snake bite..." "...or a poison that causes brain hemorrhage or damage to the brain." Just hear what I have to say. Please hear me out first... This is not sufficient evidence. This is not enough evidence... Not enough evidence... When Mr. Shashtri's body arrived at Palam Airport... ...it had completely swollen up and turned black. It turned blue and not black. When the body decomposes it turns blue. Its the discoloring of the skin, what does it matter? One second. Sir, one second. - Most of them were black and.. One second. - white pictures. Look at this, you decide blue or black. And that's not all... There were numerous cuts on Shashtri's body and blood was oozing from it. No, no, there's no record from it. You see, in such situations, the family members become very emotional. And in order to conduct a post mortem, there has to be reasonable doubt. His closest friend, CP Srivastav, had consulted two British Doctors. Dr. Liam West, and Dr. Spyro. And they both confirmed that the color blue is quite consistent with death from natural causes. And what about the cuts and the blood? Is that consistent with natural death as well? if there were cuts on his body and was bleeding... ...then it must have stained his clothes as well. And his family must still have his clothes. So ask them to send it. Sir, could it be that someone already conducted a post mortem in USSR. I studied everything and came to the conclusion that there was no foul play... ...and he died of a heart attack. Who said that? Since no one's believing a historian... ...I thought you might believe a journalist. Here. Kuldeep Nayar, India's most senior journalist. And Shashtri's Press Secretary. He was present there at that time. And answer me this, if they had any suspicion of foul play... ...wouldn't they have conducted a post mortem of him in USSR? Wouldn't our government had done it? We're truth seekers, not a conspiracy theorist. According to Parliament proceedings, the Soviet Government requested a post mortem report... ...from the Foreign minister, and the Home Minister. But they denied. I've been hearing this rubbish for a long time. This was already discussed in the parliament... ...and the government had already given the white paper to the Parliament. And White Paper is the last word? - Yes! White Paper is the Parliament's last word. Parliament is the Temple of Democracy. Temple of Democracy. So in that temple of democracy, when veteran leaders like KN Singh, HV Kamath, Krishnakanth, and Atal Bihari Vajpayee... ...demanded this Temple of Democracy for a judicial inquiry, then why wasn't it granted to them. What the government did or did not do back then can't be our concern today. That should be our concern. Sir... A question was raised in the parliament in those days... ...which still remains unanswered... Who served milk to Mr. Shashtri in the flask on that day. His own cook, or the Ambassador's cook. If it was the Ambassador's cook, then why on that particular day? What was the name of that cook? Jaan Mohammad. Let me narrate a story about common sense. A man was hanging from the roof. The rope was 10 feet long. The room was empty, and there was a 10-inch distance between his feet and the floor. There were no stool, table, or any other thing that was 10 feet tall. Just a little water scattered around. So how did that man commit suicide? There's no science involved in this. Common sense. He got an ice slab that was 10-inch tall. A slab of ice... ...which gradually melted. So Mr. Chairman, we need to find that slab of ice in this case. The root of this case is post mortem. Why wasn't a post mortem conducted on Mr. Shashtri... Allow me to tell you. Because the post mortem would've proved that he was poisoned. How? In the milk, which was in the flask... ...to which Mr. Shashtri was pointing at. So the question is who cooked for him on that day, who served him the milk, in that flask? Who was it? Jaan Mohammad. Jaan Mohammad. Jaan Mohammad, who? Who never served food to Mr. Shashtri prior to this. Never cooked for him. Oh come on, this is all Google knowledge. He had cooked for him once before... ...when in 1965 Shashtri had gone to USSR. That could've been a rehearsal. - Oh, God... No... Ramnath was Mr. Shashtri's cook. He always accompanied him. He cooked for him every day. So why not on that day? Why did Jaan Mohammad cook for him on that day? Why? Was there a conspiracy behind it? Or was there someone else behind this Jaan Mohammad, and another... You sound so confident about Jaan Mohammad as if you had ordered the hit. No, it wasn't me. But we all know who it was. We just don't like to take names... What do you want to imply? Be more specific. See...that's the problem. If you say anything relating to them it's like you committed a sin. Be specific. How shameful that you've stooped to such level. The murder of a Prime Minister isn't shameful for you... ...but you feel shameful because I stooped to this level. The case of a man who dropped his surname at the age of 12 because he was completely against caste discrimination... You're doing a great service to India's secularism. This...This... This... Secularism. This one word has done more damage to this country more than anything else. Sir, what is he saying? No, Mr. Kashyap, listen. You must listen. A Prime Minister is poisoned, the parliament is attacked, blasts in Mumbai... Don't say anything Secularism. Pathetic human being... shameless... See...she got angry and left. That's how they are. Hot Blooded. The only problem is that people speak behind your backs, and Gangaram Jha says it to your face. Someday they will be sitting next to you on a bus, train, or flight... ...with some kind of poison. Stop them. They are a danger. You know it, Ananth sir. Do something. Stop them...or someday they will bring their army to kill all of us. Will you just shut up? You can shut up Gangaram, but how will you make them shut up? I am sorry, sir. I've never seen such filth in one place before. Can we please come back to why we're all here today? Atal Bihari Vajpayee and many other leaders raised the point of Jaan Mohammad in the Parliament... It's all here. - Atal Bihari Vajpayee was in the opposition. It was his job to oppose the government. All right, what about Malkani's book? It's written here in Malkani's book, that... Come on, it's an autobiography, he can write anything. Just like you wrote in your book. Anything. I wrote my books on my own merits. And I didn't have to sleep with anyone to survive. Ohh... What did you just say? What is this? What is this place? Sir, I take very strong objection... And I take very strong objection to what you guys are doing here! You're trying to create confusion. Chaos. Are you unaware of what's going on here? We're debating over trivial issues so everyone gets confused. Letting loose a number of theories out there... ...so that over a period of time people believe it to be true. Like no one ever landed on the moon, the government planned 9/11... Gandhi was shot a second time. Bose was Gumnami Baba. Shashtri was poisoned. All this is called... This is called Dim lighting. Lower the light in the room to an extent where everything fades away... ...and no one finds out the truth or lie. Shastri died of a heart attack! Everything else is a lie! Because you said so in your book. You're the last word. That's why. Ms. Ayesha... It's a war of narratives. We dedicated our lives in recording history. And you guys want to create a new narrative now. And based on what? Your fake article, fake news, and fake facts. Just like your fake ideology. And this is a dangerous trend, I am telling you. This is a big issue. This is about you and me. It's about our future generations... Will people believe an expert's opinion or a non-expert's fake news. And we're talking about history for God's sake. Let the historians decide what's correct. And what if history proves you wrong in the future? Hello. - Bakshi speaking. I've filled the witness form. Thank you. Thank you very much. I think it's time, to tell the truth. We have to meet. Sunday morning, Parliament street. Thank you. The 2nd Prime Minister of world's largest democracy... ...goes to Tashkent Signs the war treaty And dies. Thousands of suspicions are raised... But No CBI, No IB, No SIT... Not even an Inquiry Commission. Mr. Shashtri's murder investigation... It hasn't been proven murder yet. Of course. But back in those days, ordering a hit on an international leader was not a big deal. CIA, right? Do you guys really believe... ...that the CIA orders all the hits? There are other agencies. You mean...KGB. But sir, why the KGB? Shashtri sir died in Tashkent. Everyone would suspect the KGB. In 1966, when Pakistan surrendered... ...all the spies around the world knew that Mr. Shashtri will be serving a very long term as the PM. And even a few entities in India seemed concerned. Lal Bahadur's case... ...is the biggest cover-up in the history of India. I think you haven't read the Mitrokhin Archives. Mitrokhin Archives is the world's best Counter-Intelligence report. It led to many legal proceedings in Britain and Italy. If the Indians read the Mitrokhin archives... ...it will start a civil war. When our government chucked the Mitrokhin archives in the dustbin... ...I grew suspicious. And started my own research on it. If my book had been published back then, it would've created a sensation. Because you knew that Mr. Shashtri was murdered. This is a manuscript of my book. Read it carefully. It will answer many of your questions. And if I'm not around anymore... ...then get it published for me. Good luck. Did Mr. Shashtri also meet with the same fate? Ragini Phule tried to meet with Mr. Bakshi outside the Shashtri Committee's knowledge... ...where Bakshi met with an accident and was run over by a bus. It was completely the bus driver's fault. Help! - But shouldn't Ragini Phule have been more responsible? Help! Isn't it unconstitutional to meet a witness outside the committee's knowledge? Isn't it treason? Help! Can our constitution be railroaded just to know the truth? Tonight at 9 we will discuss the role of a journalist in their quest to find the truth. You know, Kaiser. Mr. Tripathi's student has broken the official Secret's act. Stay. Stay. Stay, son. She is unlawfully influencing, intimidating witnesses. It's a national security risk. It was risky. What if she had ended up dead instead? But... Politics is all about precision. People all over the country staged protests against committee member Ragini Phule. She has been accused of misleading witness Bakshi... ...and also for conspiring his death. Now we must wait and see what will be the next step of the Committee chairman Shyam Sunder Tripathi. This committee with a majority has decided, on account of the serious allegations against Ragini Phule... ...she is fired from this committee. Thank you... Sir... What will be committee chairman Shyam Sunder Tripathi's next step? Why did you do it, sir? Go away. You shouldn't be here. You know it was a conspiracy. Let the court decide that. I want to come as a witness. The committee gets to decide who will be a witness. Go away. If a citizen has no right to know the truth... ...then at least they should be allowed to tell the truth. You know, sir, puppetry is the only art in this world... ...where the puppet doesn't know that someone else is pulling the strings. And I think you're much qualified than being a puppet. So it's up to you whether you will help me, or... "Everything goes..." Ragini Phule... - Down-Down... Ragini Phule... - Down-Down... Ragini is it true that you met with traitors. You tried to intimidate the witness. You're in cahoots with the traitors. You meet with traitors. You bloody anti-national. Ragini! Ragini, the people want to know! Ragini, the people want to know! I am sure by now you've understood that fighting against a corrupt system is not an easy task, Ragini. I lost. You cannot step down now... ...and they won't let you go any further. But there is always hope, Ragini. Hope? What hope are you talking about? I lost my job. All my savings are gone. I got fired from the committee. KP Bakshi died because of me. They are calling me a traitor. A defector. They are calling me anti-national, and you're talking about hope. What hope? But you didn't kill Mr. Shashtri, Ragini. Then who did? Who? Did you kill him? Who are you? I think you ordered the hit on Mr. Shashtri. What do you want? Why did you make me do this? Why? Because you wanted to be successful at any cost, Ragini. Whatever it took. And that was your biggest qualification as well. Deep assets are not made in a day, and they are not easy. You're not the first or the last. No one's ever found out who's the puppet here, or the puppeteer. That's why you're our deep asset. To hell with you. I am nobody's deep asset. I am no one's deep asset, and you... I am going to find you. I will find you. You can never find me, Ragini. Deep asset! Because the puppet never knows who the puppeteer is. Politicians, Police, Journalists, Officers, Writers, Lawyers, NGOs, Film-Makers, Jihadis, Terrorists, saints, sages, stone-pelters... ...they are all someone's puppet. But they don't know that. This chain itself doesn't know where it begins or ends. Just like the eternal lingering question of whether God exists or not... ...and that is His biggest strength. Who are you? Who are you? - Call me the Third Eye of Politics. And what did the Third Eye of Politics see? That you passed the fourth level, Ragini. Welcome to the final level. From here...you walk alone, Ragini. Walk alone. We've discussed all other witnesses. Next application is Ragini Phule. The Committee has already discharged her on the grounds of integrity... ...then how can you allow her? That is her judicial right. Then we should dismiss her on ethical grounds. As a witness, her integrity is under doubt. Then none of us should be here. Why don't we let the majority decide? Fine... Those against her, raise your hand. Those in her favor, raise your hand. Ayesha, raise your hand. Which one? Left or right? - What? Your writing hand, Ms. Ayesha. I abstain. Okay. 3-3... In such situations, the chairman can exercise his vote. In favor. Sir... Sir, how can you do such a thing? This is nothing less than terrorism. Right! You're absolutely right. I know, my friend. I know what a terrorist is. What terrorist couldn't achieve even after waging war for many years... ...we did it without even breaking into a sweat. We've divided India. India Somebodies, India Nobodies. India Somebodies meaning we handful of people who control it. And India Nobodies are the honest population of India. And how did we do it? They have only one strength. That is the truth. And we snatched from them. We took away their right to raise their voice. We... We are political terrorists. And you, Ms. Indira. You were supporting the cause so you can negotiate with the government... ...and keep your NGOs off the government's radar. You have no sympathy for the truth. You are a social terrorist. Your Honour. You were supporting the cause to stay in the government's good books. You've no interest in the truth. You only want your position to stay intact. You are a Judicial terrorist. And you... The government didn't renew your term. You have no apathy for the truth. You're looking for revenge. And you, Ms. Ayesha... Have you ever wondered, if there's ever an inquiry... ...and new facts emerge, then what about your book, which is a best seller. You've nothing to do with Mr. Shashtri's life or death. You just want the royalty. Royalty. You are an intellectual terrorist. And the media... Ragini is out to find the truth... ...but her editor doesn't want to do anything with the truth. They just care about their TRP. This is called TRP terrorism. And you... Ganga sir... You want an inquiry because the cook's name was Jaan Mohammad. Yes... You're a racist. More dangerous than a terrorist. A dirty, lowlife. And you... You have no truth of your own. You don't care who's doing what. As long as you keep benefitting. All of us don't want to think beyond our own personal interest. Because we think that democracy runs on votes. No. Democracy is runs on ideologies and intelligence... ...which this Ragini has. And so does today's youth. Till now we spoke... But now Ragini will speak, the youth will speak. The press will be present at tomorrow session. Yes, sir. We have no right to hide anything in a democracy. Jai Hind. Sir, I have Ragini's... Till now we spoke... But now Ragini will speak, the youth will speak. She was right we can forget the past, but not run from it. Someday you come face to face with it. Like it's happening now. That's justice. Exactly like my script. Tripathi's sinking career will get its brief glory. Ragini will think that truth has triumphed in this war. My leadership will lose the next election. People will think they gave a fitting reply to my party for concealing the truth. And everyone will be reassured... ...that truth and justice always prevail in the end. But no one knows what the truth is. No one knows who is the creator of this entire script. Who says no one can benefit from a dead PM? Breaking news. Aditya Raj has resigned as the President of NUC... ...and rumors are rife that PKR Natrajan is the strongest contender for the post. Get to the goddamn point. See this grave. It belongs to Taimur Lung. Taimur Lung knew that if he wants to build his empire... ...then he will have to capture the richest kingdom of his time. And do you know which one was that? Delhi. Look. This is Delhi, the heart of India. And this is Lutyen's Delhi. 1.25 billion people of India struggle with their problems, and poverty every day. They put their sweat and blood to continue being a part of Delhi's heart. Now imagine, if someone captures this heart... ...the country will still keep functioning, but the heartbeat, the blood, and ideology won't be ours. Capturing Lutyens Delhi means capturing the entire country. Come on... What is the reason that when a poor, honest leader comes here... ...all the veins of this heart start to suffocate him. Was Mr. Shashtri only mistake that he didn't want anyone to capture this heart? Think. Where Ragini Phule has the support of the people... ...the president of 'Yuva Vahini' has stated he won't let Ragini Phule appear before the committee. His party workers are putting up roadblocks so that Ragini Phule doesn't appear before the Committee. Back off! Move back! Presstitute. "Anything goes." "Truth is fair game." "Truth is fair game." "Truth is fair game." "Truth is fair game." "Truth is fair game." You may clean your face first. Look Ms. Phule you stated in your application that you have new evidence. We hope that you will uphold the honor of this committee and not present some fictional evidence. And I even request the media... ...that even you must uphold the honor of this committee. Please begin. Honorary members of the Committee, thank you for allowing me. Many theories relating to Lal Bahadur Shastri's death are floating, right now. I don't know which is the most popular theory of all... ...but I do know which is the least popular one. Truth. The truth. Many concerns were raised here. But there is just one question which is linked to all other questions. Post Mortem. Why wasn't a post mortem ordered for Mr. Shashtri? You've been told before. There was no post mortem conducted because of the lack of reasonable doubt. And you're right! We've been told that a post mortem is only conducted when there's a suspicion. When there's a strong reason for doubt. And there are no suspicions in Mr. Shashtri's death. There is no strong reason for doubt. I want to tell all of you that we were lied to. It was a state-sponsored lie. This won't be recorded. A few hours after Mr. Shashtri's death... ...when his body was still in Tashkent, then the 9th Director of KGB... ...arrested Russian butler Ahmed Sattarov, his fellow cooks, and Indian cook Jan Mohammad. On what charges were they arrested? They were arrested on the charges of poisoning Mr. Shashtri. Isn't this suspicion a strong reason for doubt to carry out a post mortem? But maybe it was their secret mission... ...and our government knows nothing about it. Is it possible... than an Indian cook... An Indian Ambassador's cook was arrested on the charges of poisoning our Prime Minister... ...and our government and Intelligence doesn't know. Maybe it was just for routine questioning. Then why only Jaan Mohammad? Why not Ramnath? And ma'am you said that Kuldeep Nayyar stated that there was no doubt. Please pay attention to this. See, TN Kaul was the Ambassador during the Tashkent agreement. And now when this issue was raised here in the Parliament, by Dharam Yashdev who raised it... During that time, he was the Foreign Secretary here. So I was then the State Press Executive So he called me saying "Why don't you give a statement and end this for good". And I said I've no reason to get into this now? I am not longer the press... But he kept badgering me. And that's when I got suspicious. Because he called me over and over again. I said this can be one of the aspects too. But, that must have been...recently. You also said that two British doctors, Dr. Liam West, and Dr. Spyro said... ...that the color blue is very consistent with natural death. The body turns blue when it starts to decompose. And that was selective reporting. Because it was further mentioned in that report... ...that without a postmortem report, and toxicological studies, it is impossible to say that Mr. Shashtri wasn't poisoned. All these facts...were concealed from us. How can you say that the Government intentionally hid facts from the people? You wanted proof. If there were cuts on Mr. Shashtri's body and there was blood... ...then it must have stained his clothes as well. Those clothes must be with his family. This is Mr. Shashtri's cap. What? Where did you get that from? Given to me by his grandson Sanjay Singh. Show me. Is this the cap he was wearing that day? Yes. Your evidence? Are their blood stains. All of you think for a minute... One of your family member, a relative... ...who travels outside the country. And suddenly dies on foreign soil. And you're told it's a natural death. Heart attack. But when you receive the dead body... ...it has completely swelled up and turned black. There are numerous cuts on the body and also bleeding. As a family member, do you have no right to conduct a postmortem? Isn't it true, back in those days the KGB would extract the organs... ...so that there's no trace of poison left behind? Did Mr. Shashtri suffer the same fate? Is that why he had so many cuts on his body? Okay. Let's talk about motives now. Within the next 10 years of Shashtri sir's death, India was colonized again. Yes... India became a colony again. How? Let me tell you. By using our own constitutions, our politicians, our media, our intellectuals, our systems... ...India became a colony again. Would it still be possible if Mr. Shashtri had been alive? And on whose orders was it done? What childishness is this? This is the Constitution of India... ...and not the manifesto of some Political party. Socialism can be the policy of some party, but not the country. Using the word 'Socialism' in our constitution is murdering democracy. We don't need your opinion. And this is not my opinion. I didn't say this... These are the words of the man who wrote this constitution. Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. But within 10 years of Shastri sir's death... ...this constitution by Babasaheb, the very definition of our country, was changed. The word Socialism was added here... Why was our Democracy murdered? Sir, this can't go on record. Please have this deleted. And from how many records are you going to delete it, Rana? And all these changes were imbibed when all the socialist leaders of our country, our thinkers, writers... ...intellectual beings, journalists, were in jail. This is a lie... - I... I was one of them. Democracy was murdered during Emergency. You... You should accept that now. Right? The question is who had an opportunity to benefit most from Mr. Shashtri's death... ...by murdering our democracy, and changing our constitution? Who wanted our country to sink our knee deep in the ideology of Socialism? Sir, the clues of murder are found in the events that follow after the murder and not before it. This book... This book... The Mitrokhin Archive... written by Vassili Nikitich Mitrokhin. He was the KGB's director of Archives. When the USSR split in 1992, Mitrokhin gave 25,000 secret documents to Britain. After which there as a Mitrokhin Commission formed in Britain and Italy. And there were cases filed against all corrupt politicians and leaders. There's another chapter in this book... which is about India. Why? Why wasn't this brought in? But we...don't know anything about it. Mitrokhin Report is considered the world's best counter-intelligence report... ...but in India... suppress it. Sweep everything under the carpet. Mitrokhin Archives Volume 2... Former KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin said... ...it seemed like the entire country was for sale. India was for sale. If Shashtri sir was still alive... would India still be for sale? Is this why Shashtri sir was poisoned in Tashkent? Is this why there were cuts on Mr. Shashtri's body? Is this why there was no postmortem conducted? Who put a for sale sign on the forehead of India? I request you, sir. please stop this girl. What childishness is this? Few days in the media, and you want to defame your own country. What the hell do you know? These people are right... They are all right, you are an anti-national. Let her speak! Child's play. I want to tell you, in the 1970's India had a status... ...it was Disneyland for spies. Disneyland meaning amusement park. KGB had more spies in India than around the world. Around 21 political leaders, out of which four were Ministers... ...and there's something I want to read. A top leader, Codename VANO, V A N O... ...was sent suitcases of money by the KGB. On one occasion a secret gift of 2 million was personally delivered by the KGB head in India. Another million rupees were given on the same occasion to a newspaper supporting the top leader. In 1978, the KGB was running over 300 agents in India. The biggest number in the world. It's all available in this book, for you to read. Is selling the security of our country nationalism? During the 1970s, within 10 years of Shashtri sir's death... ...media, journalists, politicians, intellectuals, historians, scientists, professors, security... ...were on the payroll of the KGB. This is Nationalism? And this is not taught to us in school, college, or anywhere else. Nobody knows this because no one records these in history. is writing wrong history nationalism? Everyone's objecting claiming that I am too young, immature... just a school girl. Presstitute. Antinational. But sir, I am a hardworking, tax-paying youth of this country. And I am proud... The truth, facts, that these intellectuals, historians suppressed over the last 50 years, lied to us... ...was raised again by me, a young citizen of India. One after the other, everything is pointing towards only one thing... ...but we didn't look at it because of our prejudices, and agendas. If you believe that a citizen's first right within a democracy... ...is to know the truth. The right to know the truth. Then you find out what the truth is now. And that will be the right way to pay our respects to late Nationalist Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shashtri. Real Justice. And that sir will be nationalism. That's all, sir. Tripathi, sir. Tripathi, sir. Did I pass the fifth level? What did you gain from all this? Topic. A sensational topic for the next Parliament Election. Meaning you're least interested in Mr. Shashtri and the truth. Winning is everything. Winning is crucial in Politics. Because losers can never change the fate of the country. By the way... Welcome to Politics.
