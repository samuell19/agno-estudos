Why are you here? What for? What for? How did you know I was here? I checked. I came to see you. You're lying. Where have you been for the past year? Give me some water. I'm glad you can work here. I'm able to send money home and plan for my future. You stink. Are you drunk? Seems you haven't straightened out. I don't like it. If I straightened out, would you love me? Eisuke, go back to Mrs. Kura. She's your wife. Can we talk? It isn't right to leave her and wander around. I want to talk. Let me in. - No. It isn't my house. Shino, why are you acting so distant? I saved your life. I'm like God to you. Some God! Look what you did to me. You know, I can still recall how you tasted then. I can't forget it. That's why I risked coming here. Risked? Look. Eisuke! Now you get it, eh? An unwavering vow Deep in my heart For the light of my country I will fight Enough. Brave young man The golden light Burning brightly Will never go out Finished? This reflection will be our first and last. Don't look. Shino... VIOLENCE AT NOON He put on your clothes when he fled the scene. Tell us what was stolen. He can take my clothes. I don't care! Take them. It will help us catch the attacker. The attacker? Yes. The high-noon attacker. Please tell us. Well? What color? I don't know. They all look alike. Ask Shino, the maid. She was also a victim. - Murdered? - No. She was unconscious. Madam! Why did you have to die? Forgive me. It should have been me. A gray pinstripe suit. Sure? Yes. I remember because I spilled sauce on it. Red pinstripes? Dark red pinstripes. Sorry. Did it hurt? I don't know what I'm doing. Was it really the high-noon attacker? So far, it's the same method. Maybe it was someone else. I don't think so. You're the only witness. If you describe him, we can create a clear profile. He was about 5'8". Strong. Long face, square jaw. One eye had a double lid. It was his right eye. Is he the high-noon attacker? You can bet on it. He's done it four times this month. Yamaguchi, Hiroshima, Okayama, Hyogo. This is his 11th reported crime. There are probably more cases that have gone unreported. This is the worst. It's his first murder. MA'AM EISUKE IS THE HIGH-NOON ATTACKER YOUR HUSBAND IS THE HIGH-NOON ATTACKER Shino, you should have screamed so Setsuko would know. After he took you upstairs, she called for you. He heard her. That's why he came down with the knife. Shino. Did he come in you? Did he orgasm? That's why he went after my wife. But Setsuko, she wasn't that sort of woman. She resisted desperately, risking her life. Risking her life. Sir, I'll resign after the funeral. Ma'am! You're heavy! How much do you weigh? TO MRS. MATSUKO KURA FROM SHINO EISUKE IS THE HIGH-NOON ATTACKER WILL YOU ALLOW ME TO REPORT HIS NAME TO THE POLICE? - Thank you. - Mom, I'll take some incense. Incense? Has someone died? It's just a visit. You, to the graveyard? You don't even believe. How much? Matsuko, you look pale. Forget your shiftless husband and come home. Genji, GENJI HYUGA it was well that you died young. I envy you. HONORARY VILLAGE ASSEMBLYMAN I wonder where we went wrong. It's too late for tears. It's water over the dam. Couldn't help it. You did what you wanted. Yes. I loved Eisuke. I still do, even though he's the high-noon attacker. But I still wonder if there might have been another way. There wasn't. I came to like Shino, and you loved Eisuke. That started it. That's not true. It started before that when we all drifted apart. I wonder which was first. We were so close for so long. We spent money together. We had all of 46 hogs and 250 chickens. Then the pen was swept away by the flood. So were the hogs and chickens. Our pen damaged other rice paddies in the village. There was a big fuss about it. You got hell from your dad who was the village head. You weakened, but you hid it. We need more spirit. We need to work together. We don't need spirit. We need money first. Ask the village head. Don't mention Father. He wanted to come here and preach. Have some pork and think it over. Fool! You took my hogs? They were killed by the flood. Eisuke, you took the dead hogs to town and sold them? Yeah, that's how it was. Thief! You lowdown bum! Thief? Hit me or kick me then. Go on. I had no money to invest. I shoveled hog dung. I sold the dead pigs to earn some money. That makes me a thief? - You are a thief! - Am I? Then hit me again. Stop! You can't hit me, huh? We should work together. Isn't that right? Love seeks no reward. Don't expect a reward when you love someone. Eisuke! Eat and drink to forget the pig pen. Where did you get that? I stole it. Genji was having a party with the village assembly. I stole it then. He'll be a village assemblyman. Assemblyman? Then he won't come here anymore? Never mind. Let's eat and drink. Eisuke, come and join us. I haven't changed in three days. I smell. Times are tough for you. I go where the seasons take me. I just work for others. A toast. Let's drink to this: Love seeks no reward. Eisuke, I hope you understand that. Yeah. You understand? Yeah. Looks like you do. Yeah. Everyone knows that people in love are equals. But few realize that love seeks no reward. You mustn't expect a reward when you love. It's different from business or politics. When in love, you should absorb yourself in it. Exactly. I agree. If you love, don't hesitate. Don't let your eyes stray from it. That's it. Teacher, let's discuss how to fix the pigpen. That's why we're here. We should work together again. Work together? I'd die of hunger if I were in love. Is there any reward for death? That was the last time everyone came together in the public hall. Young people would gather in that room for discussion. It lasted for two years. Come to think of it, I don't believe so many people can come together with one purpose. You can only come together with one other person. Like you and Eisuke? I couldn't say that to him. Were you afraid? Love seeks no reward. - Were you afraid? - Love seeks no reward. Let's go home. I'm back. Eisuke! Don't look at me like that. YOUR HUSBAND IS THE HIGH-NOON ATTACKER So you're back? Say something. Speak. - About what? - Anything will do. There's nothing to talk about. You're my husband. So I should talk? If you don't want to talk, sleep with me. Come here. I don't feel like it. Can't forget Shino? I know everything. About what? I got a letter from her today. And? Decide what to do yourself. I won't decide anything. Then I'll decide. Let's die together. No thanks. Then what will I do? Tonight, tomorrow night... - If you want, report it to the police. Kill me, like you killed the others. What's wrong? Do it. Eisuke! You say he's about 20? Yes. He's 42. But he looks like him. He's still in jail in Kyushu. He's been a criminal since the age of 16. Are all criminals like that? It depends. Can't they stop committing crimes? It depends on the person. Do they repeat their crimes because they enjoy it? Is it so much fun they can't stop? What do you think? I... I guess they get tired of it. Then why do they keep doing it? It keeps them going. Keeps them going? Yes. It's exciting for them. Did you feel he was excited? Yes. When he saw I was afraid, he got excited. He trembled with excitement. Did he enjoy it, or did he appear conflicted? That's what I'm asking you. No one notices when the first crime is committed. The mere fact that he's the only one who knows excites him as much as the crime itself. That leads to the second crime. For all of them? Yes? I'm on my way. He surfaced again. Did he kill? EISUKE HAS COMMITTED ANOTHER CRIME AND THE REASON HE BECAME A CRIMINAL IS SHINO Eisuke committed a crime last year. But he started to enjoy it because of me. I'm not sure that's true. But the police say it's likely. Telling you of my family's decision to commit suicide will not help, so I'll begin with the time I borrowed money after the flood. The crow is cawing The mice are squeaking Forget those paddies. I'll quit farming. How are we going to live? My whole family will die together. Denmatsu, are you really going to die? We have no choice. If you're serious, take this. Poison. Medicine to kill. Damn hag. Be sensible. Shino, will you help me farm? We plan to kill ourselves. Bring water, Shino. Stop this nonsense. I'm 80. I'm too old for jokes. Step aside! Give me that poison. To die? Here. Is it really poison? No. It's only stomach medicine. It stops diarrhea. I don't want it. Keep it. Human beings live by will. If you really want to die, any medicine will do. It's stupid to kill yourself. You should kill someone else instead. Why not start with Genji? Can you die by staying awake? Die? What do you mean? We lost our rice paddies. We're considering suicide. A good girl like you mustn't consider suicide. I'm not afraid to die. If we can't borrow money, we can't help but die. I'm against it. Like it or not, if we must die, we'll die. There's no need to kill yourself. Why not? Actually, I was worried about you. I was worried about your family too. What's that? Poison for suicide. My family's in trouble. Fool! Don't! Fool! I can't live. I can't die either. What will I do? I like you, Shino. This isn't a matter of love. You're awful. I'm not here to ask for money. I love you, so I'll lend you money even if you don't ask for it. That's how it is. I borrowed money from him. We gave up on rebuilding our paddies. It was 150,000 yen to culture trout and grow hops. After that, Genji made love to me for three nights. He loved me and I loved him as well. I enjoyed it. I was worried at first. About what? It was your first time, yet you liked it. You've got a nice figure. Don't be vulgar. I'm not. You have nice breasts and nice legs, like a western girl. - I'm leaving. - Must you? I've got to get up early and dig a trout pool. See you tomorrow night. Tomorrow I have to work late, or it will be delayed. Forget it. It's like the torments of hell Genji. Nice evening, huh? Sure is. You've taken to chasing girls? The moon is so beautiful... Those are a girl's sandals. I've seen them. Good night. I'm sure Eisuke thought badly of me. The next morning they were all gossiping about Genji and me. I'm going to the crime scene. Take me with you. What for? Well... We may come across the attacker. Well, I don't mind. - What were you writing? - Nothing special. I'LL STOP BECAUSE THE COP MIGHT SEE ME WRITING REPLY SOON LIBERTY EQUALITY To finish our lesson, choose one as a topic and write about it. Is this a test? No, it's not a test. Write what you like. I won't grade them. Pass out the paper. LOVE FOR HUMANITY 300,000 yen, mind you. Is that too much or too little? That's not the point. In Genji's arms, Shino purred like a cat. Eisuke! Who saw it? I saw it myself. No mistake. I understand. I'll tell her love expects no rewards. - Is that all? - Why? Aren't you interested? Interested? They'll do it again tonight. Why not go and peek? Eisuke! She hasn't come yet. Only three nights? 100,000 a night? No whore is that expensive. Shino? Genji. Was the cat purring? Shino didn't come. Why are you here? I thought some youngsters would come. Nobody comes here anymore. Shall we talk over some tea? No thanks. I've been drinking sake in the dark. Would you like some? - No, thanks. You went to get excited, but you couldn't, right? Stop it. I'm sorry. Stop. I'll show you how they did it. Let go! They were doing it like this. Eisuke! This is the public hall! I know. But no one will come. I was your teacher in high school. You taught me democracy. Just touch me. Don't go any further. I'll phone the operator. I'll have them announce that you're a rapist. Hello, agricultural cooperative. Where would you like to call? Agricultural cooperative. Where would you like to call? I wasn't serious. You should only have touched me. I really love you. Hypocrite! My period is irregular. Sometimes I'm late. So I didn't know I was four months pregnant. She'd better not go on the school trip. I'll go. - You will? - Please let me. Other teachers may want to go too. I'll talk to them. You've become bolder. Perhaps. I've been here for seven years. I'm now the most senior of the female teachers. I may be transferred soon, though. That's only a rumor. But you started it. The education committee chairman started it. What's the difference? What is your husband doing? Have a seat. He's doing the usual. Construction work? We don't own land. So we can go anywhere within Japan. I'M GOING TO OSAKA UNTIL THEN, DON'T TELL ANYONE On June 28, around 10:00 a.m., 27 Takehama-cho, Akashi City, he opened the front door at M's house. When M's wife appeared, he pretended he'd come to see her husband. He made sure she was alone. He asked for some tea. While she was in the kitchen, he drew a knife. He held it in his right hand and pointed it at her. Threatening her, he took 20,000 yen. Becoming aroused, he took her to the bedroom to violate her. She said she'd close the curtain, but tried to flee. They struggled. He slashed her chest and hand. She freed herself and fled. He injured her left breast and hand. Recovery required two weeks. Was he drunk? Yes. - Was it sake? - I don't know. - Trying to strip you... - - Miss Shino, that's enough! Last question. How did he look then? Was he excited or calm? - How dare you! What was he like? Give me that. - What does this mean? - Nothing special. Who is this "white man"? A rich man. Does this "dark man" mean a poor man? In between "Eisuke" and "Shino," you wrote the word "crime." - By "crime," you mean the Kobe incident? - No. Eisuke is the attacker, isn't he? You wouldn't understand. That's why I want you to explain. THE COP IS STARTING TO SUSPECT SOMETHING I CAN'T HIDE IT ANY LONGER The world is big. Dear Mrs. Kura. You still don't believe what I said? Eisuke is the high-noon attacker beyond all doubt. Has love for him blinded you? Can't you believe he strangled and raped women? In that case, although I'm ashamed, I'll tell you what he did to me a year ago. Nice trout, eh? They sell at a good price. You're great, Shino. It's all thanks to you. I'll be able to repay my debt soon. I've wanted to tell you. I really hate this election business. - My folks will vote for you. - Tell them not to. You want to lose? I don't want to be an assemblyman. I'm tired of this life. - What will you do? - Well... Shino, can you see me later? This evening? They'll laugh at us. They're laughing now. Come see me at the hut. Stop it. You have no time to fool around. I'm Ionely. I feel I'm completely alone. I hate life. Why not die then? I wouldn't mind. What a liar. You'll be an assemblyman. Next a chairman. Then the village head. And then... - - Stop! If you die, leave me your money and leave me Shino. Okay, Mr. Assemblyman? Genji won the most votes in the history of the village. - You love me too? - Deeply. I owe you a lot. You really love me? - Yes. Congratulations, you won. - Die with me. Yes. You said that last year too. I've decided to die. - When? - Today. Today? I must have my hops checked tomorrow. If you really love me, die with me. I really don't know why Genji wanted to die. But a year before, I'd said I'd commit suicide. So I thought I should follow him. Eisuke was watching us. I'm sure he followed us to our suicide site. You're wrong, Shino. Genji came to see me first. He proposed to me. - What is this about? - Marry me. Be my wife. Are you crazy? The election get to you? I'm all right. I've thought it over. I've been angry with you for a year. Please marry me. Why now? If you do, I'll live. Married, we could share our lives. Genji, I've lost interest in sharing. You're refusing me? You know that I am. - I feel Ionely. - Don't whine. I sit up nights making a rope. To tie me up and take me away? No, to hang myself. You would really do that? Take a look! Go on. Hang yourself. It will make you look more intimidating as village leader. Genji may kill himself. Follow him to the mountains. - To do what? - Stop him. Let him die. What a thing to say! - I'm not involved anyway. - Just go. - Are you ordering me? - If you love me, please go. What if I don't love you? I know you love me. So go. You may like me, but I don't love you. That's the truth, all right? Will you go or not? You will, won't you? Yeah. If you insist. Thank you. The strongest survive after all. Even if I die, Eisuke will live and try hard to succeed in life. I know. Even if I die, Eisuke and Shino will live. Why mention Eisuke to me? Does it bother you to die with a man? Then I'll die alone. Must you die? I thought if there was anyone to die with me, it would be you. Why me? If you survive, you'll get married again. Maybe to Eisuke. He's no good. Don't mind him. I'm sure no one loves you like I do. No man could ever love you as much as I do. That's true. I agree. Then you know how I feel, how much pain I'm in. The results of yesterday's village election. Votes counted: 3,932. Effective votes: 3,902. Genji Hyuga drew 1,921. He won the greatest number of votes in the history of the village. Elected were Sanjiro Koizumi: 801. Tokuji Ichinose: 414 Minekichi Ozawa: 342. Takehiko Yagasaki: 261. Tetsuji Ozawa: 216. Shozo Yoshida: 108. If you love me, you'll die with me, won't you? If you don't love me, you won't die with me. Eisuke, save him! Quick! Eisuke! Ma'am. We're leaving our village. Turn around and look. Every year, high school graduates leave for the big cities. Next year more of you will leave, setting out on your own. Ma'am, let's sing our school song. Yes. Three, four... Above Mt. Asama early in the morning White mist is drifting up We're standing on the Saku plain Gazing at the sky of our future Shino. - Where to? - Osaka. - Get in. - No thanks. - Where in Osaka? - The castle. - Who are you meeting? - I won't tell you. The attacker? - Nonsense. - He's in Osaka. What does the "crime" you wrote mean? Even if you don't answer, we've already investigated your home town. We'll soon find out where Eisuke's been the past few days. We'll send for his photos too. - I'll talk. - Go ahead. It happened in my hometown a year ago. What did he do? The same as in Kobe. - Were you unconscious? - No. I was dead then. Take a good look, Genji. He's the attacker. No use hiding it. Maybe he is and maybe he isn't. What's that? You know it was Eisuke! At the time, I was so shocked and upset... - - Don't lie. - You'd never understand. When I'm upset, I can't tell right from wrong. Or wrong from right. Only a woman could understand. Okay. I've heard enough. Would you do me a favor? Borrow Eisuke's photo from his wife. Newspapers? You can't get those here. Will you hold these, ma'am? The high-noon attacker is here in Osaka. Despite the efforts of police, he remains at large. Around 10:30 this morning, at the lijima residence, he attempted to assault a domestic worker. But she screamed loudly, so he promptly fled. The police believe he is broke. They warn people to be cautious. Assemble, students! Ma'am! Get in according to order. Ma'am! You saw me, didn't you? Tell me what I should do. Why not ask the police? I haven't told them anything. Eisuke's been home this whole time. Why didn't you tell me? I was busy. You've lost weight. You look thin. Are the cops here? No. But I'm out of time. Ma'am. Shino, you should have stayed in the village. Then we wouldn't have to go through this. If I had stayed there, he might not have married you. Impossible. I loved Eisuke, so I acted accordingly. When? The day of Genji's funeral, during the ceremony. The village chairman recommends making the late Genji an honorary assemblyman for the term of his service. I want you folks to remember this. Genji killed himself in the mountains. The whole thing is a useless controversy. It's a disgrace for the village. It's shameful. What should we do? Dr. Ota of the clinic and Constable Hosokawa have decided to announce that Genji had a heart attack. We want you to never mention to anyone any rumors or bad jokes to the effect that Genji killed himself. That's all there is to it. Understand? Genji, you actually went through with it. I'm sorry I didn't believe you. When you showed me the rope, I couldn't believe it. I never thought you'd really hang yourself. I laughed at you. I told you to do it. You went home with the rope. The funeral is starting. I soon became afraid and asked Eisuke to go to the mountains. Yet you died. Somebody, help! You really hanged yourself. You stayed up at night making the rope. You'd been planning to hang yourself. Stop this nonsense! You were Ionely. You could see your future and killed yourself. Don't be so hard on her. I could describe how Genji died too. Eisuke! I saw it myself. It's true. I saw him with Shino and... - Eisuke, stop. Look, they're pretending Genji died of a heart attack. Doesn't that bother you? It's over now. Then why leave? If it's over, you can stay. I'll help you. I've already decided. Shino, are you leaving for another reason? What is it? Is Eisuke involved? I failed to die and I'm ashamed of it. That's why. Tell me! It's better you don't know. I'll ask Eisuke. Don't. Want some sweets? So Eisuke told you? When did he tell you? Did you forgive him? I wonder why he did it. - What do you think? - He loved you after all. And he hated Genji. That's why. That's not true. What's wrong? If that had been all, I'd have forgiven him and married him. Married him? What do you mean? Nothing special. I just would have married him. But Eisuke married me. He chose me. He didn't love you. He did love me. In his way. Can't be helped. If you still love him, fine. Yes. This has nothing to do with you. Then settle it yourself. Settle it? Put a stop to his crimes. What's it to you? It may end, and it may not. He might do it again. Even now, as we speak. Shino, I hate you. Hate me? Good-bye. Around 9:00 a.m. on July 6, on a street in Nagoya, he saw Miss "S" walking along by herself. He planned to steal her money. He picked up a stone and concealed it. He asked her for directions to put her off guard. Then he struck her with the stone. He grabbed her handbag and dragged her into the brush. He would have violated the unconscious girl, but discovered she was pregnant and decided not to. She sustained a head injury. Recovery required two weeks. It was in Nagoya. I'll go there. - What for? - I don't know. That's up to you. Up to me? Tell the police. Do as you wish. Eisuke is your husband, and you're his wife. If you can call us a married couple. You loved him. You still do. Yes. But love can't change people. Why not? If I had known that, I wouldn't have married him. What did you think when you married him? Were you listening? Tell me. - About what? What you did to Shino. What did you do to her? Shino said not to tell. Tell me. It's in the past. Tell me. - You ordering me? - Yes. I'm ordering you. If I tell you, will you forget it right away? I will. I promise. I took Shino down and had my way with her. That's all. What do you mean? I mean I raped her. That's all. How could you? Now forget it, like you said. You fool! You're crazy! What's it to you? You're a criminal. You let Genji die. You raped Shino too. You beast! I stripped her while Genji hung there. Stop! I took her in his presence. Criminal! Beast! Murderer! Pervert! Forget it. Never! Don't cry. We don't have time for tears. I know, but... - So that was his second crime. While I adjusted my clothes, he just sat there. When I asked him to marry me, he said he didn't care either way. Either way? He seemed disinterested and said, "You can marry me, if you like." It was such a cruel, inhuman start. But if you loved him, that was enough. That's what I thought. I tried. But he soon left me. What a cruel life you've led. Sometimes cruelty is unavoidable. You were cruel to Genji too. You borrowed money, then you stayed with him only three nights. Then he died. That's between me and Genji. Nobody would understand, not even you. Then you can't understand me and Eisuke. I do. I understand you and Eisuke. What is it then? You'll never know how I feel. - I do. - Then tell me how I feel. Nagoya. - You're going? - No. Go. I'm done talking to you. The detective's here. In the dining car. Give him Eisuke's photo. Go talk to him. Then Eisuke... - No. Come with me, Shino. Me? - You're his victim. - I am. You should go. This isn't about love. It's about his crimes. Shino, don't worry about me. Eisuke's no longer my husband. He's a criminal, worse than a monster. But... - No. Let's put an end to this. - Put an end to it? - Yes. It will free us both. We'll be rid of him. - It won't work. I'll never be free. Did I survive? Yeah. I saved you. You saved my life? Thank you. What did you do to me? Fool! Madman! Why did you do it? - Because... - Talk, beast! You can't? Animal! Because I love you. Why didn't you say so? You were dead. How could you have heard? That's no excuse. - I love you. - Shut up! I thought you were dead! That's why I did what I wanted to! You don't love me. You're right. If anything, I hate you. So you did it out of hate? A corpse is no longer human. It's not a woman. It's just a thing. What's wrong with having my way with it? You're a monster. Yes, I am. I never want to see you again! I'm a monster. I'll do it again. I'll do it again and again. Ma'am. Ma'am. What are you going to do? Nothing. And? Eisuke is no longer mine. He's beyond my reach. Where are we now, ma'am? She doesn't know either. Someplace nobody knows. What's wrong, ma'am? I met an old friend. Did it make you sad? It's turning. The train's leaning. Teacher's leaning too, and so are you. There's a lake. Is that why we're leaning? You took a photo together. Eisuke and I... Stop it. I and Eisuke... We're alike. What are those boats for, ma'am? Eel fishing. Eels are caught in rivers, right? If I were a man, I might have done the same as Eisuke. So what? Or I might not have done it. I'll go. Secretly you hated Eisuke? I loved him. I hated him. Then we are the same. I hated him in a different way. Are you the detective? It's Eisuke Oyamada. May I have your attention please? A telephone call from Tokyo for Mr. Haraguchi of Kobe. Please come to Car 5 or Car 9. He was arrested in Tokyo. Get off quietly. Front exit for Class 1. Rear exit for Class 2. Don't forget anything. Ma'am. There's nothing to talk about. He was arrested. - Uta Ichinose. - Here. - Yoshimi Yagasaki. - Here. Aizawa. Taeko Yoshida. Takao. Kimie Ozawa. Fumi Yagasaki. Ono. Michiko Tamura. Inoue. Takako Yagasaki. Tomoko Yoshizawa. Yamamoto. Yoshida. I wish you all good luck. Good-bye. Ma'am! The accused has no symptoms of mental disorder. The police have ruled out temporary insanity at the time of the crimes. They have also ruled out a mental incapacity to assimilate and adapt to the norms of society. His sexual desire was strong. But not so strong that it could be called abnormal. The accused can discern between the 35 crimes he committed. He remembers clearly the motive and method of each crime. Despite slight mistakes, he can recall all of his crimes, and his descriptions are accurate. If Shino hadn't loved Genji and had married me, I wouldn't have gone astray. After I saved her life and had my way with her, I couldn't forget her. When I was drinking, I couldn't control myself. Are you saying I'm the cause of your crimes? My wife is a teacher and thinks she understands the world. She's a hypocrite. I knew what she really was. So I had to leave her and do something terrible. Was it revenge against me? Are you saying you shouldn't have married me? No. Even if I'd been born somewhere else and had never met you or Shino, I would still be the same man. I would have done the same thing. Anyone who saw the scene of the murder right after it was committed would agree to the death sentence. But in time, and if the culprit repents for his crime, they would reconsider. We'll eat. We haven't eaten. He'll be executed. We should have gone to hear the verdict. It's sensible. It's too late for us to be sensible. I'll eat first. I couldn't do anything. Not a thing for him. Nor for myself. I believe you're a good person. You did the right thing. Listen, Shino. I wasn't trying to be a good person. I wanted to love someone, like you and Genji did. Eat, or you'll get sick. Sick? If I get sick, all the better. I wish someone would strike me from behind so hard that I couldn't think about anything over and over again. I'll eat yours too. Many women were murdered by the high-noon attacker. They didn't even know Eisuke's name or what he was. They were attacked suddenly. I knew him well and even married him. Yet I wasn't attacked. I'm still alive. Stop it. I can't decide whether I love him or hate him. But I'm linked to him. I'm the only one. Do you plan to die with him? It can't be a double suicide. Even if I kill myself, it doesn't mean double suicide. Then you aren't linked to Eisuke. No need to spare my feelings. I'm linked to the high-noon attacker in many respects. That's not true. Eisuke is responsible for himself. You're responsible for yourself. No. You attempted double suicide with Genji and survived. You should know that already. What does Eisuke think? Whatever he thinks, I'm linked to him. Do you think we're linked too? If that's so, then we... - Yes, we are. Then what should we do? Die together, you and I. You and I? Yes, the two of us. I'm not forcing you. We'll get off the train, and we'll climb the mountains. We'll go to the place where you and Genji went to die. Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am. Sad news. Eisuke Oyamada, the high-noon attacker from this village, was sentenced to death at the Tokyo District Court today. End of news. I failed to die again. And now I'm alone. Ma'am, why did you die? Genji, why did you die? I've failed to die again. And I'm only 20. THE END
