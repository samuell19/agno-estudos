"The facts and events depicted in this movie respect the historical truth." 1930. The defeat is not far yet and Germany have hardly recovered from the 1918 collapse. During the symbolic presidency of field marshal Hindenburg, timorous governments followed to each others, trying in vain to reconcile the lawless forces that tore the Weimar republic apart. The incorrigible old Prussian military caste didn't forgive the politicians what they call the "back stabbing". Still full of the old "blood and honor" Germanic myths, they are ready for everything to get their revenge. Since the 1919 aborted revolution, the divided working class party had lost all possibility of seizing power. The enormous debts of war asked by the Versailles treaty and the finance disorganization had lead to such a devaluation that in 1923 a simple piece of bread cost several thousand Marks. The still powerful traditional political parties goes on fierce battle during every new election. For ten years, a little dark-haired man, the lead of the nationalist parties, passionately sought for the path of power. He now has at his disposal 107 mandates at the national assembly and large groups of fanatics, the stormtroopers. Germany needs a scapegoat to justify its misfortune. It's important to customise the spirits of good and evil. For Adolf Hitler the good will be the Germanic race, and the evil, the jews and the communists. The stormtroopers already spread terror before the indifferent eyes of the incompetent authorities. The people, left to its own devices, poor and disappointed, with no idea of what could help it since the collapse of the old structures, is wandering, seeking for a bit of food and some work. The 1929 worldwide crisis increased the disorganization of the state. There are hundred thousands of unemployed persons. Hunger, poverty, social turmoil, fear, bullying, everything prefigure a violent government. Political crimes are common, others too. In Dusseldorf, a strange criminal strikes. He is already called "the vampire of Dusseldorf". - Superintendent, anything new ? - You must have a lead, at least ! - Do you think you are doing everything possible ? - We have the right to know, the public opinion... - I don't give a damn about public opinion. and I have nothing to tell you ! - They say you let the assassin run to keep the people's mind busy and prevent them from... - It's you who are making these balderdashes in the rags where you're writing. I swear that if it was only up to me... - So ? - Nothing. They are all clear. - What are we doing with them ? - Kick them out ! Come on. Schroeder, Beck, Lehndorf... Look at this. "The corpse of Maria-Ann is at the place signaled by a cross on this drawing. Faithfully yours." At my place ! In my own mailbox ! And during this time, what are you doing ? You're a bunch of incompetents. And first, who is this Maria-Ann ? She hasn?t been reported missing... Probably a country girl with no relatives here. - We can't put a policeman behind every girl... - Yeah, yeah... In the meanwhile, it's chaos and everybody is making a fool of us. Schroeder, ask the squad and order the car. Here. That's what you wanted, isn't it, sir ? - Yes. How much is it ? - 100 Marks, sir. - Here. - Thank you. - Goodbye, sir. - Miss. Can I help you ? I want this. - 125 Marks, sir. - Yes. With a ribbon. Very well. K?rten ! K?rten, do you know what time is it ? Do you think I pay you for doing nothing ? I don't give a shit about guys like you, and fuck to your syndicate ! It's only scum and co ! If you're not agree, feel free to get the hell out of here ! There're plenty of unemployed people. And you ! What are you waiting for ? You maybe want me to help you ? Mr Kurten, it's me. I take you your shirt. - Thank you. - Do you need anything else ? - No, thank you. - Are you going out, tonight ? Please, do something for me. When you'll be back, give a small knock at my door. I sleep more safely when I know that you are home. With all these events now, it's very pleasant to have a man like you at home for a single woman like me. I feel much more safer. Good night. What lovely little feet you must have to fit these. Speaking about my feet, make yourself useful. My dear little Anna, you are driving me crazy. - Excuse-me, but I have to take my clothes off. - But, I don't mind at all ! I do. - Am I going to see you later ? - Possible. - Thank you. - I didn't say it's a sure thing. You are terrible. Oh, sorry... Anna, a gift for you. From an admirer. - "Would you accept to have a drink with me ?" Who is it ? - The guy who's seating - every nights at the small table by the orchestra. - I see. - Give that to your girlfriend. - Thank you. - Anna, hurry up ! They're really starting to get excited. - So what ? That's why they come, no ? Is it true that you want to buy me a drink ? I didn't say I agreed. - What do you drink ? - Champagne ! Unless it's too expensive for you. - Did I hurt you, before ? - No. - Thanks for you gift. - Do you like it ? A lot. - I often come to see you. - Yes, I know. Every nights ! You noticed it ? - I like your voice so much. - Really ? You are very nice. - For you, I feel able of doing anything. - Is that so ? Then go quickly to bed, and have sweet dreams. Excuse-me, somebody's waiting for me. I'm very grateful that you accepted to keep me company. You see, I love the dancehalls atmosphere but a war's injury keep me from dancing. - I hope you would forgive me. - You know, dancing is not important for us. Isn't it, Paula ? A bottle of Rhine's wine, please. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Karl. I'm Rosa, and she's Paula. - And you two, ladies, are from Dusseldorf ? - No, we're both from Zulpich. I live in Dusseldorf since already six months but my friend just arrived. It's nicer for us to work at the city. - And what are you doing, if it's not indiscreet ? - That's to say... I'm working in a family, until I find something better... - And what about you, miss ? - Me, I don't know yet. - I'm looking for something. Anything. But I heard it's difficult. - Very. Cheers. I will perhaps be able to do something for you. You know, I have a lot of friends. In different backgrounds: lawyers, doctors... And a fine young girl like you could interest one of them. To receive the clients, - for example. - see ? I told you it was important to go out and meet some people. Ladies and gentlemen. For a better protection of the residents of the city, a prefectorial decree is ordering the closing of all night businesses at 2 am. And this, until further notice... I can't help it ! Please, excuse us... If you allow me, I will take you home. - So you are living together ? - No, unfortunately, it's impossible. I stay at my boss? place, so Paula had to find something in a girls hotel. Temporarily... Here. That's where I live. The apartment of my bosses is very luxurious, but if you could see the room they gave me up there, it's something else ! - I hope to see you again. - Certainly. Now, that I have your address. See you tomorrow. After you find something for her, also think about me. I promise. - Are you sleepy ? - Oh no. Not tonight. I'm so happy. If you're not too tired, I'd like to walk a bit with you in the park. Your arm, if you allow me... It's just nearby. Mr Karl ! What are you doing ? Mr Karl... Please... Be nice, let's go back, now. You're frightening me. Mr Karl ! You're hurting me. Let me go ! Please, Mr Karl. Let me go ! No ! Help ! Let me go ! - Time to eat, pal. - Hey ! You're not going to let me down ? There's nothing to say. Rules are rules, time is time. The syndicate is categorical. You're funny with your syndicate. The time you're arguing, you could already have loaded the two bags left and I could got away. - "A young girl found in Rosenstrass park." - I really wonder what the police is doing. Anyway, this time, there is a witness. A girl who was with them. she gave a description. I feel the vampire is not going to run for long. Heil, Hitler. How come you are the building site with the lowest number of membership ? Don't you understand where your interest is ? 200 marks per membership. And you're sure to keep your job. - You dont know our bosses. - Let us deal with the bosses. - What do we have to do ? - Just sign. "Superintendent Momberg" Mr K?rten. - Give me that, Mrs Schultz. - How nice of you, Mr K?rten. It's very nice to meet somebody like you. Nowadays, people don't care for each other, anymore. What about the queue ?! Some people really have some nerve ! Thank you. Miss Rosa. Why did you tell the police it was me ? Why ? Do you really believe I could do that ? That's not possible... You can't really think that... When I read the newspaper this morning, it really disrupted me. Poor little Paula. But for heaven's sake, do you really believe I would come if it was me ? I beg of you, help me, save me. I have to hide myself like a criminal. I can't bear it anymore. You know I'm innocent and I need you to prove it. Faster, for Christ's sake, faster ! It's maybe already too late. - Nothing abnormal ? - No. Bastard ! Our single witness. Don't you buy me a drink, tonight ? Yes... Champagne ? Yes... Hans, Champagne ! - You know you are surprising me ? - Why ? After the way I treated you yesterday... Do you enjoy that ? - Coming from you, it doesn't displease me. - That's perfect ! You're weird, but I like you. What are you doing for a living ? Your friends are coming. Good evening. Good evening. No... Bring me a cup of coffe. Move away. Are you coming ? The weather's mild, don't you think ? I wish it could be night all the time. Come, I live across the place. Don't you come in ? That's where I live. Do you like it ? Listen to me ! Listen to me ! Don't stay here ! We'll call you when workers will be needed. Go home ! Go away ! BREAD ! WORK ! BREAD ! WORK ! Close the door ! Aim ! Fire ! We must take things the way they are coming. My poor Hans used to repeat me that. Anyway you're fine here. And I'll take care of you. Don't worry for the rent. One day, you'll find a new job. You know, I prefer a tenant like you. Nowadays you never know what kind of people you can come upon. - Thank you, Mrs Loebel. - Don't mention it. And try to go to bed early, tonight. It could only do you some good. Instead of hanging around I don't know where. Good evening, sir. - Can you take me home ? - Of course. - Excuse us. - Goodbye. - Can we go by foot ? - If you want. We're not so far from your place, anyway. I feel like I'm the one who make them flee, tonight. You're making him jealous - on purpose. Say, he is very much in love ? - Me, I like him a lot. - That's how it is... - Don't make him suffer too much, yet. It's too easy... Good evening. Are you alone ? I live nearby, don't you want to come with me ? So ? You're not from the talky kind ! Don't you have a cigarette ? So, you change your mind ? Anna. Yes, Mr prefect. Alas, no doubt about it, exactly the same clues. It's him for sure. Strange indeed. That's the first time he ever attack a man. It proves that the experts... What ? Well. Yes, I... Understand. Certainly, sir... Goodbye, sir. Jeez, we are in a fine mess. Do you know who the victim is ? His family just identified him. The Beckman foundry's son ! They gave us two weeks to arrest the culprit. - But, what's wrong with the Prefecture ? - It's not the Prefecture... Orders are coming from Berlin. Touch the big industry, and suddenly the minister remembers we exist ! Yet, I'd like to know what the Beckman son was doing at night in such an area ! Do you think the family really wishes that we go through that ? We have to get along on this: we do something or we don't ! - Anyway, it's going to come down on our head. - Yes, I know. So... What do we got ? - He was only carrying an address book. - Interesting ? Bar girls, barmaids, starlets from all the night clubs... Nothing much. It's better than nothing. Let's search on that. At least, it will looks like we're doing something ! All squads in alert for tonight. The eyebrow is almost done. Now, the eyes. Close your eyes... This pencil doesn't work well. Wait... Open your eye... Open it ! Now in the inside... Don't show me a face like this ! It's almost done. You look miserable ! You're in pain, right ? Now, a bit of lipstick ! Open your mouth ! Yes, like this. Now, close and wet your lips. Yes... What face you are giving me ! Wait, it's not finish ! A bit of powder, now. Just a bit. A real young girl ! Here ! Have a look at you. You're cute. Have a look in the mirror. What do you think about it ? Anna, cops are doing a raid ! - Your papers are in order, right ? - Search all the dressing rooms. Come with me, both of you. Hurry up. Next. Next. Your papers ! - Peter K?rten. Occupation ? Artist ? - Unemployed. Unemployed artist. So ? No. It's not that one, neither. It's OK. You may leave. Next. - Are you sure it's him ? - Of course. I'll never forget him. - I really don't understand you. - I don't understand myself. It's hard to explain. - When I saw him, in front of me, I started to be afraid. - Afraid ? - But there was no danger ! - I don't mean that. He looked at me a way you can't imagine. You can't kill a man like this ! - This guy is not a man ! - Precisely, he is. - You're really a prize idiot ! - And anyway, it's not our job - to help the cops. - i agree on that one. It's getting late. I have to go ! Good evening. I was waiting for you. You've been so nice... Please don't be afraid. I just wanted to thanks you. Don't be afraid. It's funny, you never laugh ! Sun is strange, finally. I'm not use to it ! But I rather like it. Not you ? You don't like what other people like. I use to live in the countryside, for two years. It was nice. The son of the bosses was called Johan. We, the kids were lying down in the barn. Sometimes, we braised potatoes under ashes. There was a big limetree, just beside the henhouse. I stole a hen, once. They buried me in the sand, up to the neck. All day. In hot sun. Hello, Peter ! - Does your mother know you're with me ? - Why ? Why ? Because we're alone and she could imagine things. You know how it is. - Say, you're not hurry to come back, right ? - Oh, no ! I adore you... Come on. - Are you taking me to the dancehall on sunday ? - I can't. I have to go to Berlin. - Wolfgang, it's the vampire ! - What ? - Peter ! - What's wrong with him ? He got afraid ! Yes. Yes. No. Yes. And never forget that you mustn't look the man, but the knife. - Are you satisfied ? - Yes, it's not bad. - Perfect. The operation will start tonight. - Tonight ? Anyway, you'll be protected. You've got nothing to fear about. You all know yours itineraries ? Any questions ? Well. Then, see you tonight. You may go. So, you're here ?! Why did you leave like this ? I waited for you for an hour... Answer me ! You've been drinking... Don't touch me, you make me sick ! Nobody ever treat me like this ! And you're not the one who's going to start, I'm warning you ! Poor guy. If you want to act like a fool, you better find somebody else. But it's going to be difficult. Because, between us, I don't know a lot of girls who could bear you ! Let me go ! Leave at once ! What's wrong,here ? Nothing... Go, now. You better hurry up. It's going to be your turn. What kind of a guy is that ? Schnapps. Filthy drunkard ! Miss. Miss, allow me... What's up ? You're crazy ! I've done nothing wrong ! Let me go ! Erna, you can come back. We hold him. Yes, I was following her but I've done nothing wrong. I didn't even get a chance to talk to her. She ran away screaming like hell before I could even talk to her. - So, why did she scream ? - How could I know ! - What were you doing on this street at 2 am ? - I was going back home ! - Wrong ! You were walking on the opposite direction ! - Yes, it's because - I had met a pretty girl. She was very attractive... - What about the knife ?! - But I told you... - So, you're nightwalking with a knife in your - pocket and you're following women ? - No ! How's that, no ?! - What do you want ? - It's about Erna... - What about Erna ? - We just find her. She's dead. "Despite you, I killed tonight, and I will not stop. Faithfully yours." - Are you hurt ? - No. - What's on your mind ? - Why did you say I'm a poor guy ? "I'm waiting for you tonight at the pub. Anna." Good morning, Mr Kurten. Your milk... - No. I really can't sing tonight. - Please understand: he has to see that you're here like every night, otherwise he won't come in. - I know but I don't want to be the bait. - Come on, you know there is no danger, the pub is a literal mousetrap ! If he dares to come in, he's done. - Believe me, you've got nothing to fear about. - That's what you say ! Come on, Anna, it's your turn. Be brave.
