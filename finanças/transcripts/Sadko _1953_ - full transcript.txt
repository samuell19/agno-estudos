VERTINSKAYA ♫ Farewell, farewell O Volga river. ♫ ♫ Twelve years I’ve sailed upon your waves. ♫ ♫ My heart will yearn for you forever, ♫ ♫ But new and valiant ♫ ♫ Feats it craves. ♫ ♫ Receive, O Volga, Sadko’s parting bow, ♫ ♫ I’ll ne’er forget your kindness and your grace, ♫ ♫ But, oh, my heart’s afire with longing now, ♫ ♫ And would the wide and mighty world embrace. ♫ Greetings to thee, great city of Novgorod! Why do you look at me like that? Don’t be angry. May I have a drink of water? Drink. – What is your name? – Lyubava. – What a beautiful name! – I must go. Wait! Won’t I see you again? Who knows? How shall I find you? When there’s a will there’s a way. Lyubava! – Move on, Vyshata. – Leave off, I’ll go myself. Good people! I’ve sold myself into bondage. Stand me a drink to sweeten my fate. Go on! You had your fill! – Such a misfortune. – Hunger drove him into bondage. – No luck, no happiness. – Where to find it? Don’t wait for it. Happiness doesn’t come of itself. In a faraway desert, I heard an old man say that happiness is a bird that skims the skies. Catch it, and it’s yours. It won’t let be caught easily, though. Where’s that bird of happiness flying? You have to search for it. In far–off lands, where all kind of wonders live. Perhaps, the bird of happiness is there, too. I’ll rig up ships and sail there. Once I see it, I won’t let it go. And on what are you going to rig up ships? Must have a well–lined purse. My psaltery is my sole fortune. – Not much of a fortune. – You won’t get far on it. Don’t grieve, you wretch. What did you sell your freedom for? – For a half grivna. – So little? Who’ll give me a half grivna for my sable hat? – The hat is mine! – Mine! – Mine! – Mine! If you find happiness, dear man, leave some for us. Poor folk need it, too. ♫ And an armless man stole an egg, Hid it in a bare–bellied man’s shirt. ♫ ♫ – And a blind man... – ...started looking for it! ♫ ♫ – And a deaf man... – ...started listening to it! ♫ ♫ – And a legless man... – ...ran to the constable! ♫ ♫ – And a mute man... – ... “help!” he yelled! ♫ Forget it, Ivashka, he’s a rich man. Just bear with him. I will not! Oh, sons of iniquity! Off with you! Come on, come on, Timofey Larionovich. Who’s so honored a merchant as I, Timofey Larionovich? Whose storehouses are so bursting with goods as mine? Upon whose charity does the people feed? Is there a richer man in Novgorod than I? You’ll burst bragging, Timofey. There’re merchants richer than you in Novgorod. And whose wife is the pride of Novgorod? Yours, Omelyan Danilovich. Your sweet young wife goes to church strutting like a peacock, and comes back like a white swan. How good, how merry are our banquets! I wonder! – Who is he? – Where did he come from? Where I came from, I am no longer there. But I was born in Novgorod, I’m Sadko, the minstrel. Never heard of you. What brings you to our feast? Why do minstrels come to feasts? Sing a song for honored merchants. Go ahead, sing. We’ll see how good you are at the psaltery. If not, we’ll throw you out. – Why should he sing? – Out with him. Let him sing. ♫ The wise man boasts of his father and mother, ♫ ♫ The fool boasts of his young wife, ♫ ♫ The merchant boasts of his fat purse, ♫ ♫ And the rich man of his gold... ♫ About whom does your shameful tongue say such things? How dare you sing such songs before us? That was only a preamble. Now for the story! I saw him at the market–place. He was stirring up the folk with his devilish talk. Quiet, noble merchants of Novgorod! It’s not to quarrel that I’ve come to you, but with a humble offer. If I offended you, forgive me. So you came begging? About time! What do you want? Listen to me, O noble merchants. Time you stopped feasting and bragging, trading and cheating. However great may be your riches, you can’t take them with you to the other world. Better take your goods to distant lands, over the blue seas, show the world our rich sables and delicious honeys. Earn glory for our dear Novgorod. He’s stark mad! A beggar trying to teach us! – Away with him! – Throw him out! – Out with him! – Away with the troublemaker! Throw him out! What the psaltery player says is true. Is it really you speaking, Vassily Potapovich? Yes, I am. But this beggar called us stay–at–homes and fools. He’s young and unwise. But he spoke the truth. What he said is to our interest. He is too green to boss over here. I’m my own master. Is the minstrel right, Granddad? What’s it to you? Just mind your business, blow your pipe. – I’ll go with him, Granddad. – Don’t you dare! So you’d like to have our goods? We’ve saved some goods for Sadko: broken dishes and rotten pots. Wait, old man. He is right. We’re wasting time here, filling our coffers. What? You’re taking the beggar’s side, you son of a dog? Going against your father? Want a beating? The Evil One speaks through him. All right, be it your way, honored merchants. I’ll get the ships without your aid. I’ll strip you of your wealth! I’ll carpet the streets with your silks! I’ll dress the poor in your brocades! You’re wrong, merchants of Novgorod! I will get the ships! – Take me along, Sadko. – Who are you? I’m Ivashka the minstrel. I’ll be your faithful servant. You’re much too young. I’ll give my life for you! Take me along, I’ll be useful to you. All right, you’ll be the first to join my troop. Now go. I must think. My psaltery melodious, you’re all that I’ve got left. ♫ Oh, the shady grove of trees, ♫ ♫ Step aside, make way for me. ♫ ♫ Through the mist of bitter tears ♫ ♫ The whole world I cannot see. ♫ ♫ Hark you, billowing wave of the lake, ♫ ♫ You’re coming in a sparkling stream, ♫ ♫ Hear of my lamentable fate, ♫ ♫ Hear of my most cherished dream... ♫ Won’t you even look at me? Oh, you wondrous vision! You marvelous beauty! – Am I not fair? – Indeed, you are! I like you, too. Your mournful song has charmed my soul. Why are you so sad, my darling? Tell me. If I cannot aid you myself, I’ll beg my father to. And who is your father, fair maid? My father is the formidable King of the Sea. His beautiful palace stands in the bottomless depths where gold–finned fishes and ocean monsters dwell. Great is my father’s domain. Come with me, Sadko, to my father’s kingdom! Wait. I mustn’t leave the earth yet. I’ve promised the people to get the bird of happiness. But I don’t know how to do it. I’m too poor to buy ships. I feel desperate. Too poor to buy ships? Come here tomorrow morning. I’ll bring you gold–finned fishes. They’re priceless. Will you love me then? Now I must leave you. The dawn is near. Goodbye, Sadko. Come tomorrow! Gold–finned fishes! They’re priceless! Ha, ye merchants of Novgorod, I’ll show you! Leave your work! All to assembly! Let’s go! What’s happened? Why is the tocsin ringing in the middle of the night? Why the ringing? Setting up a new prince or bidding farewell to the old one? – Who dared summon the people? – I did! That troublemaker again? – Take him! – Arrest him! Don’t put me to death, free men, my brothers, but let me speak! – Throw him from the bridge! – Let him speak! Let him speak. Speak, Sadko! Hear me, free men! I came to Novgorod with good news. I wished to bring glory to Novgorod, but the merchants mocked at me. They didn’t believe a word of mine. And here I’m saying before all the people: At sunrise tomorrow I’ll cast a net in Lake Ilmen and catch a wonder fish with fins of gold! There’re no gold–finned fishes in the Ilmen! You’re trying to make fools of us? Drown the liar! Catch the fish, Sadko! Catch the fish with fins of gold! All right, honored merchants, I’ll lay you a wager. If I catch that wonder fish, I get your goods. If I don’t, you chop my head off. Is it a good wager? What do you think, Orkhip Sevastyanovich? We’ll get his head cheap. – Well, what do you say, merchants? – Agreed! Have all of you free men heard that? We all did! So be it! When the sun rises, cast your net, Sadko! If you fail to catch the fish by sunset, off goes your head! All right! O, Sun! Who will join me? Take me, Sadko! Me too! Me too! I’m not inviting you to fish, we’re sailing in search of happiness. It won’t be easy, I need stalwart men. Whoever passes my test, will go with me. Come on, try us. You see? He’s collecting a troop to go fishing. Never mind, let him amuse himself until sunset. We’d better build the scaffold quick. Roll up a barrel of wine. And get me a goodly cup. Come up, good people! – Test me, Sadko. – Drink up. No good, too weak. Now you. – All right. – Here, take the cup. Good lad. Now I’ll try to knock you down. Hit me. No good, either. – Try me, Sadko. – All right, Kuzma, take the cup. If you stay on your feet, you’re good for my troop. If you don’t, I’m sorry. Come on, hit me, I’ll bear no grudge. Good for you, Kuzma! Stand on my right. Try me, Sadko! Damn that beggar! Look what he’s up to! No matter. His end is near. You’ll do! – Try me, too. – Stand on my right, Vyshata. No, I want some wine. Drink it. Come on, hit me! He needs a cudgel to hit him, not a fist. Let it be the cudgel. Let him wrestle with my bear – prove his strength! Let it be the bear. Come on. Well, Bruin, defend yourself! Easy, easy, you giant! You’ll kill the beast, you devil! You’re mighty strong, Vyshata. Get in line. Will you take me on, too, Sadko? You’re much too frail. I just look frail. You’ll find me useful. My stomach won’t take wine, and you can kill me with a thread. But I’m wily. Look! How about that? Very good, Trifon! You’ll do! You may join our troop. Now, friends, get me a silken net. The sun is high. He wants our goods, does he? We, too, have something in store for Sadko. Let’s go open our shops. Riffraff! No fish! No fish! – No gold–finned fish! – No! No! No! Thank you very much, Princess. He got it! I got it! Got it! He got it! Now you go like riffraff, dear merchant, crawl into our skin. Why do you look so glum, honored merchants? You’ve lost – time to pay up. Hand over the keys to your shops! Come on, brothers! Here are the keys to shops full of goods! Get yourselves sharp swords, clothe yourselves in new garments. You used to be the riffraff, now you are martial people. Stint not the silks and velvets – give them all to the poor folk. Why are you so glum, Trifon? Haven’t you got a rich dress, or you’re just too proud? What is there to be proud of? The new dress won’t make me any wiser. But you’re rejoicing too soon. Why should I not rejoice? Look how happy the folk are. All fed and clothed. Did you say all? Take a better look around you. – What is it? – The people, the riffraff. You’ve given away all there was in the shops, all the goods, all you had. Yet you made only a few happy. On what are you going to sail in search of happiness? I forgot about the ships. – I wanted to make folk happy at once. – And you haven’t. – Lyubava! – Sadko! Why do you tremble so, my love? My mother forbids me even to think of you. Does she think I’ll hurt you? She says you are a good–for–nothing. You appeared from God knows where, stirred up the people, insulted the merchants. You came into riches easily, but squandered everything away. How can I expect to be happy with you? That is what mother says, not I. She’s right, I am a ne’er–do–well. No one can be happy with me. I’m sick at heart, Lyubava. I don’t know what to do. I want to do what’s best, but I get carried away, as if by some rolling wave. Your mother is right – I’ll be your ruin. I don’t believe mother. And even if she’s right, I don’t care. Do as you wish. I’ll bear with grief, I’ll bear with pain, so long as you do not leave me, my beloved! To part with you is like cutting my heart in two. To part with me? Yes, Lyubava, if I get the ships, I’ll set sail. Ah, you do not love me! I love you more than life itself. If I looked for happiness only for myself, I would have never left you. But I’ve promised the people. I must keep my word. Go, then, if your heart makes you to. But remember that my thoughts will always be with you. This is all I have left. Thank you very much, Princess. Wake up, brothers! Look at these riches! Scoop up the gold, and run to the wharf. Summon the best craftsmen. Let them build ships, strong and fast. With their sides like snakes. With their bows and sterns like beasts! Make haste, brothers! The blue ocean calls us! You will not forget me? I’ll never forget you. Wait for me, Lyubava! Don’t listen to vicious tongues. I’ll come back to you even if from under the earth. Look, they are my messengers. I will send you one every year. Here, I embroidered this amulet for you. With our native soil. It’s time for you to go. I will not see you off. I don’t want people to see my tears. – What say you, merchants? – Do not bear us a grudge, Sadko. – One may imagine anything at night. – But by dawn it dispels. Let bygones be bygones, merchants. He who doesn’t run, never stumbles. We can see now that you have Novgorod’s glory at heart. That’s what we want, too. Aren’t we the sons of Novgorod? If you need our goods, take them. Thank you, merchants, for your kind words. Go, Sadko, work for the good of the people! Guests aren’t welcome here. We come with peaceful hearts. If they wish to trade with us, good. If not, we’ll bear them no malice. We’ve just come to find the bird of happiness. – I doubt it is here. – Let’s ask the people. Halt! Whence come you and who bid you here? Why are you so unfriendly? We’ve come from across the blue sea. We bring you peace. We wanted to see you, people, and let you look at us. We wish to trade with you. Go, before it’s too late! Why are you so scared of us? Another step – and it will be your last! Well, I can stop, since the host insists. Tell us, have you the bird of happiness here? Our happiness is to kill our foes. What sort of happiness is that, spilling human blood? Sometimes one is forced to spill human blood, but we don’t feel happy about it. Let us go from here. We got our pants wet just for nothing. He’s taken the step! Charge, my sons! Kill them. Watch out, Sadko! We did not lift a hand against them. You’ve started it, and you shall rue it! Come on, brothers, beat them! – What are you doing here? – Give me the sword! You’re too young. Stay here, on the ship. Sadko! You wanted blood, did you? Cool off! Hey, get a sail! Bring me a sail! Quick! Easy, you giant, you’ll damage the steed. It will be alright. Take it to the ship. It will be a nice present for Sadko. What people! – No bird of happiness can dwell here. – Very unlikely. Cheer up, brothers, we’ll find it, even if we have to go to earth’s end. A year passed, and a second, and a third is speeding away. I’ve nigh gone blind from watching. I’ve sung all the songs while waiting. Where are you, my beloved?... Hey, people, Christian and non–Christian, so–and–so, such and such, come up! Buy our goods, brought from far–away lands! Come up and buy! Sadko! – There’s a bird of happiness here. – Where is it? In that palace over there, their Prince keeps it in a golden tower, behind seven walls. – Let’s go. – Wait. A thousand soldiers guard the palace. We’ll just lose our lives for nothing. I’ll just take a look at it. Don’t be in a hurry, Sadko. We must use cunning here. Their prince treasures fine steeds above all else. What if we... Smart lad, Trifon! – Who are they? – Who are you? We are free merchants from Novgorod. We trade in delicious honeys and rich sables. We bow to you, fair Prince. – Is that your steed? – Yes, it is. How much do you want for it? It is not for sale, I’m saving it for myself. How dare you to deny me? Don’t be angry, I cannot sell it. But if you wish, I might trade it. Trade it? That suits me well. What do you want for it? We heard you have the Phoenix bird. We would like having it in Novgorod. Give me the bird, I’ll give you the steed. Impudent fool! My bird is a miracle, and you want it in exchange for a steed. I’ll order my elephants to trample you to death, and take your steed. You can’t do that! You can’t, because it’s a magic steed. Whoever takes it by force dies a terrible death. Just look at him! Then let’s do it this way. Let’s play a game of chess. If you win, the bird is yours. You lose, the horse is mine. Good, let’s play. Give up the bishop! Check! I’ve won! The steed is mine! You have lost, fair Prince! All right. You have won my treasure. But watch out, see you don’t lose your life. That is my concern. Pay up, Prince. Well, let’s go. Go in! – How shall we get back? – We’ll manage. Who thinks of turning back when seeking happiness? – Maybe we’ll go back? – No. ♪ Rest yourselves on the rugs, seekers of happiness. ♪ ♪ You’re on the threshold of the land of blissful calm. ♪ ♪ You have spent long years in pursuit of happiness, ♪ ♪ reaching your eager hands for it, ♪ ♪ and, like many before you, found nothing but a void. ♪ ♪ Naked and homeless is man upon the earth. ♪ ♪ And thus it will be forever and ever. ♪ ♪ Woe to him who tries to grasp happiness by action. ♪ ♪ Happiness is calm, ♪ ♪ sleep, ♪ ♪ dreams. ♪ ♪ Listen to me, look at me ♪ ♪ until tears veil your eyes. ♪ ♪ And fall into eternal slumber. ♪ ♪ What is the wicked world and other people to you? ♪ ♪ Pity no one, weep for no one. ♪ ♪ And I, the Phoenix, will lull you with my sweet songs. ♪ ♪ Sleep, sleep. ♪ ♪ The calm bliss.

There’s no happiness beyond the seas. Hoist sail! We’re homeward bound. My brave troop, we sailed over many a sea. But we made no offering to the King of the Sea. He is wrathful. The King of the Sea demands a human sacrifice. I led you across seas, brothers, I’ll pay the price. We shared your luck, we’ll share your misfortune. Let us cast lots. The one who loses, will go. Right. No, brothers! I’m the King’s debtor. I guess it’s time to pay the debt. I beg you of a last favor, brothers: Throw a cypress board upon the waves and hand me my psaltery. Do not weep, Ivashka. Sadko is not dead yet, so he’s alive. We may yet see each other again. Remind of me the folk of Novgorod and my beloved. Don’t think ill of me! Fly, my messenger, fly! Flap your white wings! Find my beloved! Tell him Lyubava’s heart has been worn out by grief. But she’s waiting for him, and will keep on waiting forever. Gold is more precious than iron on land. No, iron is more precious! – No, it’s gold! – No, it’s iron! How dare you argue with me?! – I’m the Sea King, after all! – And I’m the Queen! My father gave you shelter out of charity. You must obey me. – No! – Yes! No, I mustn’t! Want me to hit you with my trident? Then you’ll know. Aha, the rich merchant Sadko came to visit us. I’ve been expecting you for a long time. Brought your psaltery? – I have, Your Highness. – Good, brought your psaltery! It’s not a psaltery, it’s a cither! Shameless woman! It’s not a cither, it’s a psaltery. – A cither! – A psaltery! Stop arguing! Or I don’t know what I’ll do! A cither! Tell her it’s a psaltery! How can I butt in the argument between man and wife? Better allow me to play a song for you and the Queen. Go ahead, play, it might calm me. ♫ King of the Sea, deep and bright, ♫ ♫ For riches and fierceness well known, ♫ ♫ Human eye has never beheld such a sight, ♫ ♫ And the psaltery sings of its own. ♫ ♫ Dance, skip! ♫ ♫ Fill the hearts of the King and the Queen with glee. ♫ ♫ How can you, dear King, be so bored? ♫ ♫ How can you, fierce King, not make merry a lot? ♫ ♫ Don’t order Sadko punished for a song, ♫ ♫ But order your monsters to join in a dancing throng. ♫ ♫ Dance, skip! ♫ ♫ Fill the hearts of the King and the Queen with glee! ♫ Play merrier! Ships are wrecked?! People drowned?! No more! What’s happened? – Why have you stopped playing? – The strings broke. I must go back to earth for new ones. Ha, sly fox! Just arrived and want to go back already? First marry one of my daughters. See how many I have? Then I’ll let you go for new strings, if you wish. Choose the one you like best. Tell father you will marry me. But I won’t! Just promise him, that’s all. And I’ll help you once more. I’m taking this one! Not her! She’s my favorite daughter. – Take any other. – No other. How dare you speak to me like that! I’ll only give a wink to my vassals and they’ll tear you to pieces. Ask mother! The King has refused. What do you say, noble Queen? Let him marry her! And I said he won’t marry her! – He will! – He won’t! Yes, he will! Let him marry whoever he wants. I do not care. Why did you make me lie to your father? I cannot marry you. I know you do not love me, but I’m in love with you. My heart is not my own. I belong on the earth. Forgive me, please. Fate willed it so. May you not order your heart? No, Princess. I cannot be angry with you, though I should. It must be true that love is stronger than anything. What do you wish now? I want to be free again. Help me get to Novgorod, Princess. All right... Follow me. He took our dear daughter, Vasya. We’ve lost our Ilmen girl. Make haste, Sadko. There is no faster sea–horse in all of the sea kingdom. Thank you, Princess. Farewell forever. We’ll never see each other again. – Farewell, Princess. – Now go, before I change my mind. Get up, King! Sadko has escaped! Escaped? My shell carriage! Lyubava! My beloved! – Sadko! – My precious one! My darling. Where’s Sadko? Sadko’s no more. Why no more? Here I am! – Have you found happiness? – I have! Where is it? Here! I’ve been to many lands, and to the bottom of the sea, but there’s nothing fairer than my native land! Here is our happiness! The film was restored at M.
