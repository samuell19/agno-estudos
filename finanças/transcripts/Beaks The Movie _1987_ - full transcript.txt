(light dramatic music) (bird cawing) (man screaming) (engine rumbling) (trash rustling) (birds squawking) (birds chirping) (dove cooing) (gun banging) - Blindfolded and with a single shot, Giuseppe Ferreri will attempt to bring down a bird in flight. This is considered one of the most remarkable feats in the history of marksmanship. (light dramatic music) (bullet clicking) (dove cooing) (gun banging) (dove cooing) - Why did you do that? - Huh? (speaking foreign language) For pleasure. - Pleasure? For pleasure? Fuck. (upbeat music) (wings flapping) (engines rumbling) - This is considered to be one of the most remarkable feats in the history of marksmanship. (gun banging) - Cut here to commercial and freeze frame in the titles. Bring up music. - Okay, you got it. ♪ All set to ♪ ♪ Open ♪ ♪ No matter what I do ♪ - What is this? - Great stuff. Fantastic shot of that bird blowing up. - I wish you could fly. Listen, when are you gonna give me some decent assignments? I'm a journalist, not a sideshow worker. And this is ridiculous. A story about attack chickens? I'm not gonna do it, I won't do it. - It'll make great copy. The attack of the killer chickens. You do that kind of stuff well. - I majored in journalism in college, not animal husbandry. Give me some news to cover. - Soon. These specialty items get good response and our audiences enjoy watching you do them. - Enjoy watching me make a fool out of myself. - Just do this one. I'll get you some hard news to cover, I promise you. Anyway, if you don't I'll can your pretty little ass. - You have such class. - I'm giving a party at my place tonight. Wanna come? - Sorry, I only have time for chickens. (light music) - What a waste of talent. Come on, come on. (gun banging) (wings flapping) (hawk cawing) - 80 over 140. Excellent, much better. It looks like this weather and the rest are doing you a world of good. - Yeah, I feel a lot better. Well, if you need anything just call me. - Sure, thanks. (birds chirping) (deep breathing) (light dramatic music) (hawk cawing) (man gasps) (man groans) (man screams) (hawk caws) (chickens clucking) - It happened here. His coops are filled with happy chickens. Harmless creatures as though it would seem. Then one day for no apparent reason they launched an attack on their owner. The feathered mutiny spread and these turkeys joined the fray, and it's not even close to Thanksgiving. This would've been dismissed as a sick, as a single freak incident, except for one thing. We'll be right back to tell you all about it. Stay tuned. Cut. (Peter chuckles) It's not funny, Peter. I'm a grown woman, I shouldn't have to be doing this. - Hey, man, we all gotta make a living. (Peter laughs) - Thanks a lot, jerk. Roll. So, what happened next: Mr. and Mrs. Neilson were just coming out of church when a new feathered army attacked them. Flocks, wild birds, and doves swooped down on them from the trees. - I had been in business for 22 years. Checked the coops every morning, I'd clean up. Water and feed the birds, nothing ever happens. But I don't know why it was different. - Okay, cut. (birds chirping) Okay, action. Come in. Do you know why? - I'm not really sure. The chickens got together like they were following some kind of orders. Just like that, they jumped on me real angry-like. Lucky I had a broom with me and I beat them off. I was close to the door and I backed out. I've never seen anything like it. I really was scared. - And these attacks were repeated by wild birds? - That's right. Any bird that sees me jumps on me just like that. - What Mr. Neilson is saying is hard to believe, so we brought this along for an experiment. A small, harmless canary. The delight of many households. In fact, this canary was bred and hatched in a cage. Let's see what happens. (light dramatic music) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (wings flapping) (engine rumbling) - Control tower, this is November seven three four delta foxtrot, requesting permission for landing on runway nine, we're over. - Negative, number seven three four delta foxtrot. It's impossible to land, there's a huge flock of birds flying over the airstrip. They've already caused two crashes. We can't risk it, over. - What's the nearest auxiliary runway? I've got about 30 minutes worth of fuel, over. - You've got the Air Ranch Airstrip north-northeast from your present position. It should be well within your fuel range. It's the only strip that's operative at this time. Do you read me? Over. - Go ahead, tower, I read you. - The radar indicates two large masses of birds directly in front of you, over over. (engine rumbling) (light dramatic music) (birds thudding) - Mayday, mayday. No, I have a collision, I can't control the-- (clattering) I'm in a spin, I'm out of control! Hey, hey, pull out, you gotta help me, I'm, I'm going down. I'm going down! (man screaming) (engine rumbling) (booming) (light dramatic music) (birds chirping) (wing flapping) (door thudding) - It's really crazy. If I hadn't seen that canary I never would've believed it. - Well it's starting to make a believer out of me. - The guy we're going to see was also attacked. - By what? The turkey roasting in the oven? - Yeah. - All right. (door thudding) (wings flapping) - [Man] I've spent most of my life hunting animals, but now it's their turn. I am the target. I saw your broadcast about the man who was attacked by his chickens. I think there might be a link. - But that was on the other side of the world. - Birds invented flying, remember? And who knows how they communicate with a different species. I really don't know, but since I was attacked I get a feeling that I'm being watched. There's always a flock of doves following me as if I were a marked man. - Do you see any doves out there? - Believe me, they are watching us right now! - Do you think since your attack you've created a fear and maybe you're giving off some vibrations provoking the birds into attacking? - Birds just don't cluster and follow someone around like that. It seems organized. Like these birds are on a recon preparing a war. Imagine that! Billions of birds at war with mankind. You think I'm talking nonsense. (fire crackling) I'm not crazy. There was a town that was attacked about 30 years ago. I know two of the survivors. I am sure even you would be horrified by the stories they can tell you. - Where are they? - They live in Rome. - Could you put us in contact with them? Maybe this would help give some credibility to your story. - [Man] Sure. - Looks like we're off to Rome. (light dramatic music) (dove cooing) - Some things you can't forget. - This is really hard for me to believe, but I think this is something that should be brought to the public's attention. Something that could be a possible disaster. Usually birds are thought to be harmless creatures, and what you're saying contradicts all that. - Well, they sure didn't behave that way. That time, at least, you know. They seemed to be organized, like it was planned. - Like they were acting on some kind of intelligence? - Like tactics. They'd fly, then regroup, and attack again. They always hit whoever was wounded or seemed the weakest. (light dramatic music) - Oh. (woman giggles) (doves cooing) (wings flapping) (woman screams) - It was horrible. Every time I remember anything about those birds. I just can't help it. - I guess what Susan and I have come to feel is exactly as the birds felt. Hate. - Do you think it was hate or an instinct to survive? - Hey, I'm asking the questions here. Hate or an instinct to survive? - Possibly the chance of survival is that the crisis, the way man contaminates everything. - So what you're saying is their natural instincts led them to defend their natural ecological balance? A last effort for the survival of their species? - One other things that's hypothetical, of course, nature has been pushed to the wall and possibly, if they fight back hard enough, a little balance will be restored. - Not if the contamination has gone too far. - What happened to us is what's happening to others. Seems like a clear warning. - A fight to the end no holds barred. (light dramatic music) (wings flapping) (engine rumbling) (engine rumbling) (wings flapping) - Remember the park I told you about in New York? Well, this is it. I used to play here when I was your age. Hey, go up there, let me get a shot of you with the birds. (wings flapping) Okay, Junior, come over here, okay? Now look, just place yourself right here, I'm gonna take a good photograph. Right here, right here. Good, wait just one moment. (wings flapping) (light dramatic music) Honey, come over here, I wanna take a picture with you and the kids. - [Woman] All right. (wings flapping) (doves cooing) (light dramatic music) (dramatic music) (light music) (engine rumbling) - [Reporter] Finally in the news today, and this has to be in the believe it or not department, it seems that a priest from a small mountain community drowned in a lake where he was fishing. Not so strange. However, two eye witnesses claim they saw a large flock of wild ducks attack the priest causing him to lose his balance and fall in-- - Shit, the world's got bird fever. - [Reporter] Coincidentally, from Acapulco, Mexico-- (upbeat music) - This has to be some kind of weird joke. Chickens, canaries, ducks, give me a break. - Oh, look at those chickens over there. Now, if they were my buddies being roasted with a skewer up their ass, I'd be a little upset too. - I'd like to put a skewer up some of those executives back at the office. (light dramatic music) (phone ringing) (dove cooing) - Hello? - Hi, Grandpa. - Hi, beautiful. How are you? - Fine, Grandpa, how's my horse? - He's fine, my love. He misses you very much. You have to tell your mom to bring you over so you can ride him. - Okay, I think we're going tomorrow. Here's Mom, bye. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Sharon, how are you? Glad you called. Yeah, I'm fine. I feel real good. Perfect. - Oh, that's super, Daddy. Look, tomorrow's Cathy's birthday and I thought maybe (hawk screeching) we could have a party for her at your place. Just a few kids from her school. Nothing real big, don't worry. I'll bring everything, hm? - Okay, hun. See you tomorrow. - Bye, Dad. (hawk screeching) (light dramatic music) - Well, well, you little bitches. Nature may be changing, but not that much. You are not all on the same side, you bloodthirsty... You're just like us. You won't surprise me again. (bird cawing) Welcome home. (gun banging) (light music) - A body like that and brains. Men don't have a chance. (Vanessa giggles) - I think the champagnes getting cold. - You mean hot? - Yeah, hot. (lips smacking) I'm getting thirsty. - All right. Me, too. Well, let's drink. To being together and to the start of something big, huh? - Yeah. (Vanessa giggles) (wings flapping) (light dramatic music) (doves cooing) (crickets chirping) (tapping) - What the hell is that? Go and see. - Be careful. - I will, don't worry. (light dramatic music) Who is it? Who is it! - I don't see anything. - God damn it. (crickets chirping) There is nothing out there. (wings flapping) (woman screaming) (man groaning) (wings flapping) (doves cooing) (both screaming) (doves cooing) (lips smacking) (soft moaning) (phone ringing) - I'll be right back, don't drown on me, okay? Here. (water trickling) - What a dismal thing to have to share the planet with assholes who have to call at a moment like this! - Hello? What! Right. Yes, we'll be right there. (water trickling) - Sorry, buddy. Maybe next time, huh? - [Woman] Calling nine Roger, southbound seven, southbound seven. Meet southbound-- - Torn to pieces. That's how we found him. (birds chirping) - [Dispatch] 10-4, 33, sir. All units come to me, standby 41155 go ahead. - The scene is macabre. The bodies of Arthur and Olivia Neilson were found bloodied and mutilated. The victims of doves. The same white doves that have always been a universal symbol for peace. And they have now declared a war. A mysterious war against mankind. (engine rumbling) (upbeat music) - Why don't we park somewhere on the beach? You know, watch the ocean. - Are you sure you only wanna watch the ocean? - Well, that depends. Do you fool around? (guy chuckles) (engine rumbling) (light music) (waves roaring) (wings flapping) (bird screeching) (knocking) (clattering) (knocking) (light music) (air hissing) - [Woman] Well, I guess we better stretch our legs while Daddy changes the tire. Come on, kids. - [Boy] This trip is boring. I'm gonna go play! - No jack. Where's the god damn jack? Your damn brother never returned it, that's where it is. - Yes, but it's your own fault. Why did you lend it to him? - Christmas spirit. Remember last Christmas? - Okay, okay. What do we do now? - Wait. Wait until someone comes around and helps. - Hey, Dad! There's a camper down the beach. Maybe they have a jack. - Okay, you go down and ask them. - I'm gonna get my jeans, mama. - Fortunately they're more like me and not like someone from your family. - Don't bitch at me. You're the ass that forgot to get the jack back. - No, I didn't forget, I just thought your brother had the decency to return it. - You know what? - No, what? - You're a real asshole. (door thudding) (light dramatic music) - Hey, is anybody there? - Hey, is anyone there? - Shut up, let me do the talking. (dramatic music) (wings flapping) (kids screaming) (engine rumbling) - Stop whimpering. And you, too, okay? I know what we saw was awful, but it's over, so try to get a hold of yourselves. - You'll simmer down. The kids are frightened, and with your shouting you're making them more upset. - I'm sorry. We have to get a hold of ourselves. (engine rumbling) - Watch it! (tires screeching) (light dramatic music) My God. - I don't know what the hell is going on, but we gotta get outta here. (engine rumbling) (wings flapping) (engine rumbling) (wings flapping) - Shit, we're stuck. - Take care. (dramatic music) (wings flapping) (doves cooing) - Lock yourselves in. I gotta get some help. - You stay here with us, or we'll all go with you. - Okay. Let's go to the other side of the inlet. We'll be safer there, come on. Outside. Hurry up. Come on. Carmen. (door thudding) Come here, come here. (wings flapping) Hurry up. (door thudding) (light dramatic music) (muffled talking) (bird cawing) What was that, what? Is anybody here? (light dramatic music) Is anybody here? (bird cawing) (birds warbling) (birds chirping) - Doctor Murayama, as you know, birds have recently been responsible for many unusual and violent incidents all over the world. Have you noticed any strange forms of behavior here in the aviary? - Well, in this case, the birds react in an entirely different manner. They don't have total liberty, and this lack of freedom can lead into many different responses. One of them could be the unwillingness to mate. This is a serious problem we have here. - [Vanessa] Are these birds endangered because of the losses of the natural habitats? - Basically, yes. Man has gone about his business without regard to the natural ecological balances. In many cases, the migratory species suffers the most. - Peter! Okay, you were saying, Doctor? - For instance, many species are hatched in one place, and then in winter they migrate to another. This is a built in program that leads them and they must go back to the same place in order to reproduce. But when man invades and pollutes their nesting sites, the species tended to disappear. Because they have no other place to go, it's not in their program, so to speak. - But they're having conservation measures. - Yes, many, but for each one we protect hundreds are destroyed. Man's progress is too rapid and protection too slow. So many birds are subject to extinction. That is, of course, if many doesn't destroy himself first. - This is Vanessa Cartwright reporting for Mega Vision. (light music) (birds chirping) (door thudding) (light dramatic music) - Help! Help, please! Please help me! Please, please, can you come help me? Hey! Help! Help, please! Help me! (door thudding) (wings flapping) (birds cawing) (birds screeching) (birds screeching) (doves cooing) - I'm back. Fucking birds flapping everywhere. What the hell happened to you? - The birds. - We gotta find a place to hide. - Under the pier. If they attack we can dive under the water. This way. (heavy breathing) (light dramatic music) It's out there. (wings flapping) (doves cooing) Hurry!

(dramatic music) (hawk screeching) (clanking) (dramatic music) (hawk screeching) (dramatic music) (hawk screeching) (thudding) (woman groaning) (hawk screeching) (engine rumbling) (birds chirping) - We're not in Spain on a holiday, you know. What's happening here is really incredible. - You wanna hear something incredible, listen to this. We've been getting calls and telexes from news agencies all over the globe. And they've all got the same stories. - What? I can't hear you very well. - I said that all kinds of birds are attacking people in countries all over the world. So, what you've got isn't news. All my information is going on the air. Before you get back with your story. - Forget about your damn show and who's on first. What's going on here, we've gotta do something. We've gotta warn them or help them or do something. Damn it! (doves cooing) (light dramatic music) - How'd it go, did you get through? - Yeah, I got through. - So, what'd he say? - A lot more than you could imagine. Would you do me a favor? - Sure, anything. - [Vanessa] It's been a long time since I've been in a church. Would you go with me? (birds chirping) (muffled talking) (leaves rustling) (wings flapping) - Make sure I stay. (birds squawking) (light dramatic music) (sirens wailing) (door thudding) (muffled talking) - With our checks the radar has picked up spots of millions of birds heading in this direction. - Get me a brandy. - The same here. - Mister mayor, what do you plan to do? - Evacuate. We'll evacuate the town and take everybody to a safe place. It won't be easy, people are bound to panic. - These two areas here and here have already been attacked. - [Peter] When? - This morning at dawn. - People panicked and tried to get away in their cars. The roads were fogged in and there was a chain reaction of collisions. The roads are blocked. We have helicopters and rescue squads evacuating the survivors. - My God, what's happening? - We're in a very vulnerable position here. - You mean we're sitting ducks. - That's not funny, Peter. - It's not meant to be. We can't just sit here. I never believed this, but we've gotta do something and we've gotta do something fast. We can't just sit here drinking! - We don't have time to wait for help, that's for sure. - The birds. The birds banded together, right? - We all know that. - So what we need to do is concentrate the population. Our strength is in numbers. - Yes, that could be. - It's our best defense. - It's our only chance. - Well, Benitez, alert everybody and bring them together. And use all available transportation. - The roads are blocked, remember? - Those birds certainly know what they're doing. - I saw a train when we first arrived. Is it still here? - I'll check on it. - I hope so, 'cause if it isn't we've gotta do something and we've gotta do something fast. (horn honking) (train rumbling) (wings flapping) (birds squawking) - [Vanessa] Please, keep the window closed. Don't even peak outside. - [Woman] This is real dumb. I don't believe any of this bird stuff anyway. - [Guy] Hey, call Colonel Sanders and he'll take care of these birds and we'll have them prepared for lunch. - Well, the only lunch they're gonna have is us, penguin brain. Please, everyone, listen to me. Keep the windows closed, draw the curtains, and don't open them no matter what happens. I repeat. Keep the windows closed. (train rumbling) (wings flapping) (light dramatic music) (birds squawking) (muffled kids talking) - I don't like the look of those birds. There's just too many of them. Get in the house. (wings flapping) - What could they possibly do to us? - Go! You heard me, get inside! (birds squawking) (light dramatic music) - Okay, kids, we're gonna have a party inside the house. (wings flapping) - Kids, hurry! Get in the house! (birds squawking) Hurry, get in the house! Hurry, get in the house. (horse neighing) (birds squawking) (wings flapping) (light dramatic music) (wings flapping) (kazoo tooting) (wings flapping) (girl crying) (wings flapping) (birds squawking) Okay, honey. You and me are going to make a run for it. Okay, let's go. (birds squawking) (light dramatic music) (girl crying) (man groaning) - Patty? Where's Patty? Patty? Patty! Dad! Patty, run! Patty, come here! Dad! Dad! Oh my God! (birds squawking) Dad! Dad! (woman screaming) Dad! Dad! (woman screaming) (dramatic music) Cathy? Cathy! David, quick, come here! (thudding) (light dramatic music) - The bedroom window's open, I better go up and close it! (glass shattering) (dramatic music) (woman screaming) (girl screaming) - Cathy? Cathy! Cathy! (light dramatic music) (girl crying) (woman screaming) I'm coming! (doves squawking) (wings flapping) (knob rattling) (girl screaming) (dramatic music) (woman grunting) (paper rustling) (wings flapping) (birds squawking) (fire crackling) (doves cooing) (light dramatic music) (birds squawking) (horn honking) (train humming) - Large flocks over there. (birds squawking) - They've been trailing us for a long time now. - They won't attack no train, that's for sure. - I wouldn't be too sure about that. From what I've seen of these birds is they might just be waiting for the right moment. - Maybe they just found it. (sheep baaing) (horn honking) - Please keep the windows closed. (horn honking) (sheep baaing) - We'll never get out of here at this rate, we've gotta move these sheep outta the way. - How do we do that? - Can't we just push them out of the way with the train? - Too many of them. (sheep baaing) (train rumbling) (birds squawking) - [Man] Well, why are we stopping? - Yes, we're herded in here like cows to slaughter. I don't like this one bit. - Yes, well, this isn't supposed to be fun. - I know that, but why are we stopping? - I'd like to know myself. As soon as I found out, I'll let you know. Please keep the windows closed. - Who gave you the authority to give orders around here? Who do you think you are? - Just someone who doesn't wanna become bird seed. If you don't like it, you do what you wanna do. I'm sure the birds would love to meet you. (sheep baaing) - Then we'll cut the fences and give them more room to move out. Do you got anything I could do that with? - All I've got are these pliers, but they'll go through all right. - Fine! (sheep baaing) (birds squawking) (wings flapping) No, no, no! The guns won't do any good if they decide to attack! Go down the tracks, keep the sheep from going that way. I'll get the fence! - Be careful, Peter! (wings flapping) (birds squawking) - Come on, let's go, come on! Ah yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go. Ya ya, look alive! Let's go! (wings flapping) (birds squawking) Ya! Get outta here! Listen, come on, come on, come on! (dog barking) (wings flapping) (birds squawking) Yah, come on, come on, come on, let's go! Come on, come on. Come on, come on, let's go, let's go, let's go. Get outta here, let's go, come on, come on! Let's go, come on! (dramatic music) (wings flapping) (birds squawking) (train rumbling) (glass shattering) All right, all right, everybody out of this car. They know their targets and won't stop till they've broken in. Let's go, come on, out! Everybody, out, out, out, out! (wings flapping) (birds squawking) - [Woman] Someone help me, please! (muffled talking) (dramatic music) Somebody help! (light dramatic music) Someone help me, I'm pretty sure they're almost here. (wings flapping) (birds squawking) (muffled talking) - [Man] Get the windows! (man screaming) Get away! - Cut this car loose before they break that glass! (metal screeching) - And here's one for him. And one for me. (booming) (glass clattering) - Right into their own trap. (birds cooing) Looks like we'll get some peace now. (fire sizzling) For awhile, anyway. (light dramatic music) (wings flapping) (birds squawking) - Momma, Momma, I think they're coming again! - You've been a very brave girl, Cathy. Now, I need you to be brave just a little longer. We have to keep the fire going, okay? (thunder rumbling) (light dramatic music) (bird cooing) (horse neighing) (wings flapping) (birds squawking) Stay close to Patty. I'm going to have a look. - Are they dead? - I don't know. (light dramatic music) (wings flapping) (birds squawking) (suspenseful music) Come on, it's our only chance. Let's go! (dramatic music) (birds cooing) (dramatic music) (wings flapping) (suspenseful music) (wings flapping) (birds squawking) Kids? Kids? Where are you? Kids? (door creaking) (woman gasps) Thank God you're here. You can come out now! Come! Come! (woman groans) We're getting out of here. (light dramatic music) (birds cooing) (dramatic music) (woman gasps) (gate squeaks) (horse neighing) Everybody inside the car. Hurry! Hurry! - I think the birds are gone. Hey, they're leaving! - [Boy] Sharon! - Kids! Hurry! (light dramatic music) Hurry! (wings flapping) (birds squawking) Hurry. (engine sputtering) (engine rumbling) (light dramatic music) - In all parts of the world the birds appear to have returned to their normal behavior. All attacks have ceased and we seem to be at peace. The nightmare ended the same way it started: suddenly and inexplicably. Perhaps they knew they could never defeat the most cruel killer of all; man. Or perhaps their message was sent; a message to care for this fragile sphere we call Earth. To nurture and share the riches with all God's creatures if we are to survive. Or maybe it was a rehearsal for some kind of natural master plan. A plan to discard any and all who disrupts nature's perfect harmony. A plan to choose who will survive. (baby cooing) (light dramatic music) (buzzing) (dramatic music)
