YOU WERE HIRED TO PUT UP SEATS. DO IT, OR I'LL GET SOMEONE ELSE. GET LOST. HIYA, PAL. HIYA, PAL. HEY! YOU'RE THROUGH TRYING TO GET EVEL KILLED. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? EVEL NEEDS MORE ROOM. THERE WERE BLEACHER SEATS ON THE FIELD LAST JUMP. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? EVEL IS MY PAL, TOO. SURE. AS LONG AS HE FILLS YOUR POCKETS WITH BLOOD MONEY. LOOK, I'LL GIVE YOU ODDS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SEATS ON THE INFIELD. IF YOU DO, I'LL MAKE KINDLING WOOD OUT OF THEM AND YOU. GET YOUR PAWS OFF ME. THE STADIUM OWNER SOLD THOSE TICKETS, NOT ME.

WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT? YOU TAKE EVERY EDGE YOU CAN GET. FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN OF THE LOCAL COMPETITION, I THINK I STARTED HERE WITH AN EDGE. ACTUALLY, YOU MIGHT CALL IT A DOWNRIGHT UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. YOU'RE ONE OF THE BIGGEST BLOWHARDS I'VE EVER HEARD. TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE. WAIT A MINUTE. NOW I KNOW. I SAID I WAS OUT LATE LAST NIGHT. YOU'RE KATE MORGAN, THE FEARLESS PHOTOGRAPHER. SO THEY SENT THE CHUMP OUT TO SHOOT THE CHAMP. YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A GREAT JUMP, HONEY. MISS... OR SHOULD I SAY, MS. KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE STILL WRONG. I'M NOT HERE TO SHOOT YOU JUMPING. MY EDITORS WOULDN'T WASTE FILM ON THAT. MY ASSIGNMENT IS TO SHOOT YOU IN CASE THIS IS YOUR LAST JUMP. I'M NOT GOING TO QUIT. I DIDN'T MEAN THAT. BOY, YOU'RE REAL CUTE, AREN'T YOU? O.K., KIDS, LET'S GET BACK TO WHAT WE WERE DOING. SIGN MY AUTOGRAPH BOOK. IS THAT THE SAME BIKE YOU'RE USING IN THE BIG JUMP? SAME ONE. WHERE'S YOUR HOMETOWN?

EXCUSE ME FOR A MINUTE. HERE COMES MY CADDIE. WE'VE GOT BUSINESS TO DO. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. EXCUSE US. KIDS, WATCH OUT A MINUTE, WILL YOU? GIVE US A STATEMENT. I WILL WHEN I COME OUT.

I'LL NEVER BE HARMED ON ACCOUNT OF WILL. HE'LL FINISH YOU WITHOUT TRYING, HIM AND A BOTTLE. BEN, THE CLOCK STOPPED FOR HIM 10 LONG YEARS AGO, BUT UP UNTIL THEN, HE WAS THE GREATEST MOTORCYCLE JUMPER IN THE WORLD. NOW HE'S THE GREATEST BOOZER IN THE WORLD. YOU STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND. EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW THAT GUY TAUGHT ME. WHEN I'M OUT JUMPING, THE CROWD SHOULD CHEER HIM AS WELL AS ME. HA. WHAT'S THE COUNT? 42,500-- HALF YOUR ADVANCE. WITH THE SAME GUARANTEE YOU ASKED FOR. YOU'VE GOT IT. YOU'RE A LITTLE SHORT, AREN'T YOU? SHORT? HEH HEH. COUNT IT YOURSELF. I COUNTED IT TWICE. NO. IT'S ALL THERE. YOU OWE ME MONEY FOR THE BLEACHER SEATS YOU SOLD AT THE LAST JUMP. WHAT IS THIS, JUDGMENT DAY? THAT'S OVER RIGHT NOW. I AM GOOD AND SICK AND TIRED OF HAVING ROCKS THROWN AT ME. I'VE TAKEN ALL I'M GOING TO TAKE FROM THIS OUTFIT. FIRST YOUR FALLING-DOWN, BOOZEHOUND BUDDY BRACES ME OFF AND NOW YOU. BACK OFF! YOU'RE NOT MY JUDGE AND JURY! I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE! SO YOU DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY, BUT YOU STOLE FROM ME... PROMOTER.

YOUR FRIEND EVEL KNIEVEL HAS MADE A DEAL FOR ANOTHER RECORD-MAKING JUMP AT ANOTHER RECORD-MAKING PRICE, $85,000. YEAH. I SAW THE PAPERS, MR. MILLARD. HEY, JESSIE, I'M THE NUMBER ONE SPORTS PROMOTER. YOU STICK WITH ME, I'LL MAKE YOU THE NUMBER ONE BIKE JUMPER. WHAT, IS THAT A PROMISE? THAT'S A CONTRACT. GOOD. I LIKE THAT. COME HERE. NOW, YOU START TONIGHT. THAT'S THE BEGINNING. WE GO FROM THERE. ALL RIGHT. IT'S AS GOOD AS DONE. HOW'D YOU MAKE OUT? HERE ARE THE BLOW-UPS. SIT DOWN. DOES THIS JESSIE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT OUR PLANS? ABOUT HIS PART OF THE PLANS, HELPING US GET EVEL TO MEXICO. I'M STILL AGAINST HIM MAKING OUR DEAL WITH KNIEVEL. HE DOUBLE-CROSSED EVEL ONCE. THEY'LL KICK HIS BUTT OUT. NO. I'VE STUDIED KNIEVEL. HE'S A BIG MAN. HE DOESN'T HOLD A GRUDGE. HE FORGIVES AND FORGETS. JESSIE WAS ONCE HIS BEST FRIEND. I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON THIS. MORE THAN A LOT. WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING. WHAT ABOUT THE BIKES? WELL, BASICALLY, THEY'RE STANDARD HARLEYS. THEY'VE MADE A FEW MINOR GEARING CHANGES, BUT NOTHING WE CAN'T HANDLE. WHAT ABOUT THE TRUCK? WELL, THEY'VE GOT GOLD-LEAF LETTERING HERE, UH... CUSTOM DOORS, CUSTOM WINDOWS, SPECIAL WHEEL COVERS. THE BIG PROBLEM'S THE INTERIOR MATCH-UP. I'M TAKING CARE OF THAT PROBLEM TONIGHT. WHAT'S OUR TOTAL INVESTMENT SO FAR? WELL, UH, THIS IS THE EASY PART. 50,000, GIVE OR TAKE A FEW DOLLARS. THE BIG MONEY IS IN PAYING FOR THE MERCHANDISE-- $3,600,000. IT'S A LITTLE HIGH. SO I SPENT A LITTLE MORE THAN I FIGURED, I MAKE A LITTLE MORE THAN I FIGURED. HOW ABOUT THE TRAILER? IT SHOULD BE HERE ANY TIME. BARTON'S BRINGING IT IN. HEH HEH HEH. I GUESS NEITHER OF US HAS CHANGED. I'D HAVE BET YOU'D BE OUT HERE. JUST DOING MY JOB. EVEL DEPENDS ON ME. SOMETHING YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT-- DEPENDABILITY. YOU MEAN WHEN EVEL AND I WERE TOURING AND I SPLIT? THE WORD IS QUIT. OH, COME ON. I WAS NEW, JUST STARTING OUT. I HAD A BETTER OFFER. IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. NOT FOR ME. IT WAS JUST LIKE YESTERDAY. THEN WE COULD DRINK TO TOMORROW. WHAT DO YOU SAY? BET YOU STILL KEEP IT IN THE SAME PLACE. DID YOU EVER THINK OF BUYING A BOTTLE? YEAH, BUT IF I DID, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TO BITCH AT ME FOR? EVERYTHING. AHH! OH, BOY. OH, THAT SURE HIT THE SPOT. HEY, GIVE ME SOME OF THAT. SURE. THERE YOU GO, PAL. HEY, WHERE'S EVEL? JUST FOLLOW THE CROWDS, JUNIOR. JUST FOLLOW THE CROWDS. SEE YOU, WILL.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU GRADUATED? OUR SCHOOL ONLY GOES UP TO THE SIXTH GRADE. I'M--I'M READY FOR JUNIOR HIGH NOW. OH, WELL, YOU STILL HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY QUESTION. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? SHOULDN'T YOU BE IN SUMMER CAMP OR SOMEWHERE? THE SCHOOL WROTE YOU A LETTER ASKING ABOUT THE SUMMER, BUT YOU NEVER WROTE BACK. OH, WELL, I MOVE AROUND A LOT. SOMETIMES, LETTERS GET LOST. SO MAYBE I DIDN'T GET NO LETTER, HUH? I'M GLAD TO MEET YOU. WELL, Y-Y-YOU'LL GET ALL MESSED UP. YOU KNOW, I WORK FOR A LIVING. PLEASE? WELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE IT AROUND HERE, NO BREAKFAST IN BED. WE MAKE OUR OWN BEDS IN SCHOOL. HERE. WHAT'S THAT? SCRAPBOOK. NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS. OH, WELL, EVEL LIKES TO READ ABOUT HIMSELF. THEY'RE ABOUT YOU. HERE'S WHERE YOU JUMPED IN NEW YORK, AND THAT'S WHERE YOU WERE NUMBER ONE IN TEXAS. I'VE BEEN COLLECTING THINGS ABOUT YOU ALL MY LIFE, SIR. WELL, FORGET IT LIKE I DID. IT'S ANCIENT HISTORY. [CAR APPROACHING] HEY...YOU MUST BE TOMMY. I RECOGNIZE YOU FROM YOUR PICTURES. BOY, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU. WELCOME ABOARD THE S.S. KNIEVEL. GLAD TO MEET YOU, MR. KNIEVEL. HEY, EVEL TO YOU, PAL. WHAT A SURPRISE. YOUR DAD DIDN'T TELL ME YOU WERE COMING. COME ON, WILL. LET'S SHOW TOMMY AROUND. NO, THANKS. I'VE GOT WORK TO DO. GO AHEAD. TOMMY, YOUR DAD TAKES GREAT CARE OF THESE BIKES FOR ME. HE'S THE BEST IN THE WORLD AT IT. THAT HELPS TAKE CARE OF MY LIFE, TOO. YOU WANT TO SEE MY VAN? I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT. I'VE LIKED IT SINCE I READ ABOUT IT, MR. KNIEVEL-- I MEAN, EVEL. BOY, THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT SUMMER, TOMMY. WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE TOGETHER NOW. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS? WHAT'S THIS, SOME OF THE MERCHANDISE WE GOT? [MILLARD] THAT'S A SAMPLE. IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE REAL THING. YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT. NOW DON'T FORGET, JESSIE, WHEN THIS IS OVER, YOU'LL BE NUMBER ONE BIKER AND ABLE TO AFFORD ALL OF YOUR PLEASURES, GREAT AND SMALL. YES, SIR, MR. MILLARD. [CHUCKLES] WELL, THERE HE IS. GOT THE CHECKS? OH, YES. JESSIE, GO TO WORK. YOU'LL BE A MILLIONAIRE. I THINK YOU SHOULD BE HANDLING IT YOURSELF. THIS WAY IS BETTER. HE'S NOT QUICK ENOUGH FOR THESE NEGOTIATIONS. HE'S OUR BEST CHANCE. KNIEVEL LIKES HIM. HE GAVE JESSIE HIS FIRST BREAK IN THE BUSINESS. THIS GUY MILLARD WANTS TO BOOK US FOR A FIVE-DAY TOUR DOWN IN MEXICO. YOU DRAW 100,000 BUCKS A JUMP. ARE YOU KIDDING? LET ME HANDLE YOU DOWN THERE. I'LL GET YOU THAT MUCH FOR THE TACO CONCESSION. BEN, WE'RE NOT HOOKED UP FOR LIFE. DON'T BE GREEDY. TOO LATE TO CHANGE. LISTEN, EVEL, ANYBODY CAN TALK MONEY, BUT MILLARD MEANS IT. HERE'S 5 POST-DATED CHECKS FOR $100,000 APIECE. EVERY TIME YOU DO A JUMP, YOU CASH A CHECK. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. YOU'RE HOLDING HALF A MILLION BUCKS IN YOUR HAND. LIKE A SAID, JESSIE, IT'S A LOT OF BREAD, BUT MILLARD WANTS ME RIGHT NOW. I MADE A DEAL WITH BEN FOR TWO MORE JUMPS. I GAVE HIM MY WORD. WHAT HE SAYS HE'LL DO, HE DOES. YOU HEARD THE MAN, JESSIE. YOU KNOW, BEN'S A THIEVING LITTLE COYOTE. HE'D SELL THE MOON FOR A BUCK AND A HALF. IF I STAYED UP 24 HOURS A DAY, I'D GET MY CUT. SORRY. OH, I'M SORRY, TOO. YOU THINK ABOUT IT, O.K.? SEE YA. NO REGARDS. [BAND PLAYS SOUSA MARCH] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET ME DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FAR END OF THE TRACK. THAT'S THE EVEL KNIEVEL CARAVAN. TRAILERS, VANS, TRUCKS WITH EVEL'S RAMPS AND HIS BIKES. THERE IS THE SKY CYCLE THAT ALMOST CARRIED EVEL TO HIS DEATH AT THE SNAKE RIVER... ALMOST. THAT GLEAMING WHITE PICKUP WITH EVEL'S FAVORITE JUMP BIKES IS CUSTOM-BUILT. THAT'S THE ONLY ONE LIKE THAT IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. YOU'RE LOOKING AT $3 MILLION WORTH OF MECHANICAL WONDERS ON PARADE. YOU AND I ARE LUCKY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THEY TURNED AWAY THOUSANDS OF REQUESTS FOR TICKETS. LOOKS AS THOUGH EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA WANTS TO SEE EVEL JUMP. RIGHT NOW YOU COULDN'T GET A GRASSHOPPER IN THIS ARENA. THOSE LIONS AND TIGERS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ARE NOT HOUSEHOLD PETS. EACH OF THOSE CATS WEIGHS SEVERAL HUNDRED POUNDS. THEY DON'T LIKE STRANGERS ON NOISY MOTORCYCLES. AS EVEL WILL TELL YOU, HE CAN JUMP, BUT HE CAN'T FLY. THERE'LL BE NOTHING BUT AIR BETWEEN EVEL AND THOSE CATS. THIS MAY BE THE MOST DANGEROUS DAY IN EVEL'S LIFE. WILL THE WIND AFFECT YOUR JUMP TODAY? NO. IT WILL HELP ME. HOW FAR ARE YOU JUMPING? FAR ENOUGH. WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S ENOUGH FOR RIGHT NOW. I'LL SEE YOU ALL IN A LITTLE WHILE. GOOD LUCK, EVEL. THE OTHER PHOTOGRAPHERS ARE OVER THERE. YOU'RE OVER HERE ALL BY YOURSELF. WHAT ARE YOU, A LONER? WELL, I DON'T RUN WITH THE PACK. NEVER DID, NEVER WILL. NEITHER DO VULTURES. OR EAGLES. YOUR REASON FOR BEING HERE IS DIFFERENT THAN THEIRS. WE ALL HAVE OUR JOBS TO DO, RIGHT? YOU THINK TODAY'S THE DAY I'M GOING TO GET IT, HUH? YOU SAID THAT. I DIDN'T. HEY, TOMMY. GREAT CROWD, HUH? SURE IS, MR. KNIEVEL. HEY, YOU. EVEL. EVEL. THANKS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE GREATEST AND BRAVEST SHOWMAN IN THE WORLD-- EVEL KNIEVEL! IT'S ALL YOURS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU IN LONG BEACH TODAY WITH MY OLD PAL FRANK GIFFORD. I SEE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE STANDS TODAY, SO BEFORE I MAKE THE JUMP, THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I'D LIKE TO SAY TO YOU THAT'S BEEN BOTHERING ME FOR A LONG TIME. I GO TO INDIANAPOLIS EVERY YEAR TO SEE THE INDY 500. I GO THERE WITH FRIENDS THAT DRIVE AND RACE. EVERY YEAR WHEN THEY GO THERE TO QUALIFY, THEY USUALLY HAVE TO GO AS FAST AS THEY CAN TO GET A FRONT-ROW POSITION. THEY PUT NITRO IN THEIR CARS SOMETIMES INSTEAD OF THE FUEL INTENDED TO BE IN THE CARS SO THAT THEIR CARS WILL GO FASTER, AND THEY DO FOR 5 OR 10 LAPS, AND THEN THEY BLOW ALL TO HELL. AND YOU PEOPLE, YOU KIDS, IF YOU PUT NITRO IN YOUR BODIES IN THE FORM OF NARCOTICS SO THAT YOU CAN DO BETTER, OR SO THAT MAYBE YOU THINK YOU CAN DO BETTER, YOU WILL FOR ABOUT 5 OR 10 YEARS, AND THEN YOU'LL BLOW ALL TO HELL. [SIGHS] YOU'RE A WONDERFUL CROWD. I'M GLAD THAT YOU ALL MADE IT. I'M GOING TO DO MY BEST TO MAKE IT RIGHT ACROSS THIS JUMP. THANK YOU. O.K., WILL, LET'S CHECK THE JUMP BIKE OUT. I ALREADY CHECKED IT OUT. LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT IT HERE. THESE HANDLEBARS ARE A LITTLE HIGH. LET'S LOWER THEM. O.K. HEY, YOU GOT YOURSELF A FULL-TIME JOB TILL SCHOOL STARTS. DAD, WILL YOU TEACH ME HOW TO RIDE SOMETIME? FORGET IT. I'M AN EX-RIDER. NOW THE MOMENT YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. EVEL KNIEVEL ATTEMPTING TO JUMP A CAGE FULL OF JUNGLE KILLERS AS HE TRIES FOR A NEW WORLD'S RECORD OF 150 FEET. [GROWLING] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HERE COMES EVEL KNIEVEL, ROARING DOWN THE ROAD TO GLORY, MAKING THE MOST SPECTACULAR LEAP OF HIS LIFE! [CROWD SCREAMS] [SCREAMING] HEY... THIS AIN'T FOR KIDS! HE'S MY FRIEND! LET ME GO! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE STAY IN YOUR SEATS. PLEASE STAY IN YOUR SEATS. HELP ME OFF WITH MY HELMET. OH... SORRY, MISS. I'M NOT DEAD YET. YOU BETTER GET SOME MORE FILM FOR THAT CAMERA. IF HE DIES, WE'RE IN A HELL OF A FIX. I NEED KNIEVEL IN MEXICO ALIVE. GET ON THE TELEPHONE. I WANT THE BEST ORTHOPEDIC AND NEUROSURGEONS IN TOWN STANDING BY. [SIREN] OH, WILL. I'M HERE, EVEL. I'M RIGHT HERE. LET'S GET HIM IN THE AMBULANCE. HELP ME UP. YOU'VE GOT TO GO IN THE AMBULANCE. I WANT TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE, PLEASE. HE CAN'T. HE'S HURT BAD. HELP ME UP, WILL. JESSIE. TAKE IT EASY. EASY. EASY, BABE. YEAH. [WILL] ALL RIGHT. THANKS, FRANK. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN... I THINK YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN MY LAST JUMP. [CROWD MOANS] NOW YOU CAN GET THE STRETCHER. NO. COME ON. WE WALKED IN HERE TOGETHER. HELP ME WALK OUT. GENTLY. GENTLE. [APPLAUSE] TAKE IT EASY. AS YOU CAN SEE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, EVEL KNIEVEL IS WALKING OUT OF THE STADIUM. WE DON'T KNOW HOW SERIOUSLY HE'S HURT. HE WALKED INTO THE STADIUM. HE'S WALKING OUT UNDER HIS OWN POWER. HE TOOK A TREMENDOUS CRASH AT OVER 90 MILES PER HOUR. WE DON'T KNOW HOW SERIOUSLY HE'S INJURED. WE'LL TRY AND GET A REPORT LATER ON. MORE TELEGRAMS. PUT THEM OVER THERE WITH THE REST. WILL...TOMMY. HEY, EVEL. BOY... IT SURE IS GOOD TO... WAKE UP IN A HOSPITAL. [IN UNISON] AT LEAST I KNOW I'M ALIVE. TOMMY, I'M SORRY. THIS IS SURE TURNING OUT TO BE A BUM VACATION. I'D RATHER BE HERE WITH YOU AND DAD THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. THAT'S THE BEST COMPLIMENT THAT'S BEEN PAID US IN A MONTH OF SUNDAYS. EVEL, YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION? TOMMY, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THERE'S NO SECRETS IN THIS ROOM. WHAT IS IT? HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND ABOUT NEVER JUMPING AGAIN? TOMMY, IN EVERY PERSON'S LIFE, THEY HAVE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THEMSELVES. THEY HAVE TO KNOW WHEN THEY'VE GONE FAR ENOUGH. LIKE...LIKE YOUR DAD. YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW WHEN IT'S TIME TO QUIT. BUT YOU'RE JUST NOT ANOTHER PERSON. YOU'RE EVEL KNIEVEL. YEAH. YEAH, I KNOW. COME ON, JESS. YOU'VE GOT MORE HORSEPOWER THAN THAT. COME ON. COME ON! COME ON! COMING THROUGH! A LEFT-HAND TURN, PUT MY FOOT DOWN, AND SLIDE RIGHT AROUND THIS CORNER HERE. ARE YOU O.K., EVEL? OH, YEAH. YOU ALL RIGHT? I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD DO A WHEELIE IN ONE OF THEM THINGS. I BETTER GET YOU BACK TO THE HOSPITAL. LOOK AT MY WHEELCHAIR. GONNA HAVE TO CALL WILL TO FIX THIS. NOW, SIT DOWN. OH, O.K. HANG ON. EASY. THIS AIN'T NO HILL-CLIMBING CONTEST, YOU KNOW. BOY, IT SURE FELT GOOD TO GET OUTSIDE IN THAT SUNSHINE, JESSIE. IT'LL FEEL BETTER WHEN YOU GET THIS BACK ON. OH, EASY, EASY. HOW ABOUT SOME ORANGE JUICE, HUH? I COULD GO FOR ONE OF THOSE. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ANY MORE ABOUT QUITTING? THAT'S ALL HE EVER DOES THINK ABOUT. LET ME TELL YOU GUYS SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW WHY I SAID I WAS GOING TO QUIT. I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN IT. EVERY TIME I FALL OFF OF THAT MOTORCYCLE, I THINK THE PAIN IN MY LEGS OR MY BACK OR MY ARMS IS WHAT'S TELLING MY HEAD WHAT TO SAY. MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO LISTEN. I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. YOU QUIT LIKING MONEY? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WELL, COME ON NOW. MAKING THAT MEXICAN TOUR, IT'S JUST LIKE BEING HANDED THE KEYS TO FORT KNOX. ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN. YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. O.K. I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. LET ME KNOW. IT'S GOT TO BE SOON, O.K.? O.K., JESSIE. THANKS FOR COMING OVER. SEE YA. WILL, WHAT DO YOU THINK I OUGHT TO DO? LOOK, EVEL, THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD JUMPERS, AND THEY DO ALL RIGHT, TOO. THEN THEY GET HURT AND QUIT. BUT NOT YOU. NO, NO. YOU CRASH, YOU BURN. THEN YOU GO AT IT AGAIN AND AGAIN, AND, WELL... I DON'T THINK YOU'RE EVER GOING TO CHANGE. ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME I SHOULDN'T QUIT? I'M NEVER GOING TO TELL YOU ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT'S YOUR LIFE THAT'S ON THE LINE, BUT... ALL I... I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WHATEVER YOU DO DECIDE, I'M WITH YOU. HEY, WILL... VIVA TEQUILA! VIVA KNIEVEL! [KNOCK ON DOOR] [EVEL] HI. HI. COME ON IN. THANKS. HI, THERE. HELLO.

WE STARTED OUT ALL WRONG, AND I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END THAT WAY. SO? DON'T LET IT END. HAVE TO. I'M FLYING OUT TO COVER THAT NEW REVOLUTION IN SOUTH AMERICA. [CHUCKLES] BIG DEAL. THERE'S ALWAYS A REVOLUTION IN SOUTH AMERICA. I ALWAYS TAKE GOOD PICTURES. YOU OUGHT TO STICK AROUND. I'M, UH, GOING TO MAKE MORE NOISE THAN YOU'VE EVER HEARD ANYWHERE BEFORE. I THOUGHT YOU QUIT. WELL, I CHANGED MY MIND. IN FACT, UH, WE JUST DECIDED WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO OLD MEXICO. WILL... WHY DON'T YOU CALL FRANK GIFFORD AND TELL HIM TO COME ALONG? TELL HIM IT'S FIESTA TIME. CHECK.

HAVE YOU SEEN TOMMY LATELY? HE'S REALLY HAVING A BALL. I THINK THAT, UH, ALL KIDS MUST LIKE TO PLAY HOOKY, EVEN FROM THEIR PARENTS. TOMMY DOESN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS. BUT YOU'RE HIS FATHER! ONLY ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. WE'VE JUST DRIVEN 1,100 MILES TOGETHER. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF TALKING. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYBODY ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS FOR TOMMY EXCEPT YOURSELF. MISTER, YOU OUGHT TO STOP. YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN A DISTRICT ATTORNEY, LADY. I WOULD'VE WON THIS CASE, BUSTER. [MARIACHI BAND PLAYING] I HAVE FOLLOWED ALL YOUR EXPLOITS WITH GREAT INTEREST, ESPECIALLY THAT CANNON SHOT IN IDAHO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BUT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN NOTHING YET.

EVERYTHING THAT I DO TODAY, TOMMY, WILL HELP SAVE MY LIFE TOMORROW. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD TO DO SO MUCH. WELL, RIDING A MOTORCYCLE'S SERIOUS BUSINESS, AND IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU FOUND OUT FOR YOURSELF.

WHO TOLD HIM HE COULD RIDE? I DID. HE HIT THE CURB. THAT HAPPENS. WE CAN FIX THAT BIKE. WHAT ABOUT THIS KID? I TOLD YOU ONCE BEFORE-- BUTT OUT! IF I HADN'T HAVE BUTTED IN, TOMMY WOULDN'T BE HERE. HOW DO YOU THINK HE GOT HERE? SCHOOL SENT HIM. THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM TO SAY. I SENT THE MONEY FOR THE PLANE TICKET. 10 YEARS OF BLAMING HIM FOR YOUR WIFE'S DEATH AT CHILDBIRTH WAS LONG ENOUGH. SHUT UP. I FIGURED WHEN YOU FIRST SAW TOMMY, IT'D BE A WHOLE NEW WORLD FOR YOU, BUT NO! YOU PUSHED INTO MY LIFE JUST ONCE TOO FAR! STOP IT! ANYWAY YOU WANT IT, MAN. STOP IT! STOP IT, YOU APES! STOP! YOU STOP! TOMMY, I LEFT MY EQUIPMENT UP IN THE STANDS. PLEASE GO WATCH IT FOR ME. ONE MORE MINUTE, YOU'D HAVE THAT KID RUNNING FOR THE NEAREST ORPHANAGE. WHERE DO YOU GET OFF TELLING HIM WHEN TO BE A PARENT? ALL YOU'VE DONE IS TRY TO CONVINCE TOM THAT YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN HIS DAD. WHAT DO YOU KNOW? THAT'S A LIE. THAT'S A FACT. YOU'RE SO BUSY MAKING HIS LIFE ONE BIG CHOCOLATE MALTED, HE HASN'T HAD TIME TO KNOW HIS DAD. YEAH. SHUT UP, YOU DROPOUT! YOU SAID TOMMY DIDN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS. WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT. I'VE HAD A FRONT-ROW SEAT AT THIS UGLY SPECTACLE, AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING. I THINK YOU'RE BOTH THE WORST-- REAL NOTHINGS. [KNOCK ON DOOR] EXCELLENT. EXCELLENT. HOW DO YOU LIKE IT? IT'S ALL RIGHT. UH, JUST TO TRY IT FOR SIZE. BART. HEY, JUST LIKE THE SQUIRREL STASHING AWAY NUTS. HOW MANY WILL IT HOLD? 3,000 BAGS. WHY ARE YOU USING THIS TRAILER? WHY DON'T YOU USE EVEL'S RIG? COME ON WITH ME. LOOK AT THE REST OF IT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE PLAN IS. NO ONE IS GOING TO STOP EVEL KNIEVEL'S FUNERAL PROCESSION FROM COMING BACK ACROSS THE BORDER. YOU HAVEN'T ANSWERED MY QUESTION. WHY DON'T YOU USE EVEL'S RIG? IT'S TAKEN A LOT OF MONEY TO GET THIS BUILT HERE. NO WAY TO GET EVEL KNIEVEL'S TRAILER TO DO THE JOB, SO I'M HAVING THIS DUPLICATE BUILT. O.K. YOU GOT THE MONEY? SHOW HIM. HMM. YOU GOT 2,999 MORE BAGS OF THIS? DELIVERED TOMORROW, AS AGREED. THEN YOU GET YOUR CASH TOMORROW, AS AGREED. I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU SNEAKING INTO MY ROOM. YOU WON'T BE NEEDING THESE ANY LONGER. PLEASE. WHAT IS THIS? I'M SORRY, EVEL. HI. I'M RALPH THOMPSON, RESIDENT ADMINISTRATOR. WHERE'S WILL? RIGHT THIS WAY. HE'S AMONG FRIENDS. THIS IS AN AMERICAN SANITARIUM, MR. KNIEVEL. WE'RE STAFFED BY AMERICANS. WE ACCEPT ONLY AMERICAN PATIENTS. BOY, YOU SOUND TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. THE POLICE RECOGNIZED HIM FROM HIS NEWS PHOTOGRAPHS AND CONTACTED BOTH YOU AND ME, LUCKILY. YEAH. HE'S LUCKY. LET ME HAVE MR. ATKINS' CHART. I HAD HIM BROUGHT HERE BECAUSE I TRUST MR. THOMPSON. GENTLEMEN, THIS WAY, PLEASE. WHAT ARE YOU? ARE YOU A DOCTOR? NO, I'M A THERAPIST, BUT I HAVE HAD EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU'RE BOTH DEAD WRONG. I WISH YOU WERE RIGHT. I FELT THE SAME WAY, SO I HAD THE LOCAL POLICE CHECK. THIS IS PROOF POSITIVE, I'M SORRY TO SAY. IT'S A TELETYPE OF WILL'S ARREST RECORD IN THE STATES. RIGHT OVER HERE, MR. KNIEVEL. JUST LOOK RIGHT THROUGH THAT WINDOW THERE. AAAH! HE TOOK AN OVERDOSE OF SOMETHING. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. IF WE'RE LUCKY, HE MAY COME OUT OF IT. NO WAY. NO WAY. IF HE'S BEEN DRINKING, ALL RIGHT, BUT DOPE--NO WAY. YOU SAW FOR YOURSELF. I'VE KNOWN THIS GUY ALL MY LIFE. YOU CAN'T TELL ME HE'S AN ADDICT. EVEL, HERE ARE THE FACTS. YOU'LL HAVE TO SHOW ME MORE TO PROVE TO ME HE'S A JUNKIE! AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE THE HEAD HONCHO. YOU LISTEN AND LISTEN GOOD. WHATEVER HE WANTS, HE GETS, NO MATTER WHAT THE COST. UNDERSTAND? SURE. YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK? OUT OF SIGHT. WHAT A MEAN MACHINE. THAT'S A STRATOCYCLE, JESSIE. I HAD IT BUILT ESPECIALLY FOR YOU. YOU CAN BUY 20 ORDINARY BIKES FOR WHAT THAT ONE COST. TRY IT. YEAH. ARE YOU STILL WORRIED ABOUT JESSIE? DID YOU SEE THE WAY THIS BABY HANDLES? I COULD CLEAR 200 FEET WITH IT. HOW'D YOU LIKE TO TRY FOR THE WORLD'S RECORD? I THOUGHT EVEL WAS DOING THE JUMPING. IF SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO EVEL-- WE WOULDN'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN, BUT YOU'D BE AROUND TO TRY FOR THE TOP SPOT. MR. MILLARD, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO EVEL, YOU CAN DEPEND ON ME. OF COURSE I KNOW THAT. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WITH EVEL, YOU'RE MY TOP MAN. WILL YOU TAKE THE PORSCHE BACK FOR ME? SURE. SEE YOU. I THINK HE REALLY WANTS KNIEVEL'S SPOT. I'M COUNTING ON IT. NORMAN, GET THE BIKE. MARTIN. THAT'S OUR ACE-- AN EXACT DUPLICATE OF KNIEVEL'S JUMPING BIKE. NOW. [TIRE BLOWS] NOW, THAT TIRE'S GOT TO GO FLAT THE INSTANT KNIEVEL'S COMPLETED HIS JUMP. I CAN SEND THIS SIGNAL FOR A QUARTER OF A MILE, BUT I WON'T BE MORE THAN 100 YARDS AWAY. DOES JESSIE KNOW ABOUT THIS? YOU SAW ME SEND HIM BACK TO TOWN. HE CAN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. HELLO? HELLO? HELLO? HELLO! GIVE ME THOSE KEYS! GIVE ME THOSE KEYS! AAH! WILL, TAKE IT EASY. IT'S ME--EVEL. WHO LET YOU IN? WAIT. I'M NOT YOUR ENEMY. THAT'S WHERE WE LEFT OFF. SO WE HAD AN ARGUMENT ABOUT TOMMY. LET IT GO. WHAT'D YOU TELL THE KID ABOUT ALL THIS? I DIDN'T TELL HIM THAT YOU'RE A DOPE ADDICT. HE'D TAKE ON THE SUPREME COURT FOR YOU. YEAH. WILL. I KNOW! I KNOW. I KNOW YOU THINK THE WORLD OF THAT BOY, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL HIM YOURSELF. I'M SURE GOING TO TRY. WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOU? I FOUND SOME PICTURES IN JESSIE'S ROOM. THEY TOOK SHOTS OF THE TRAILER. EVERYTHING--UP, DOWN, SIDEWAYS--EVERYTHING. WHAT DOES MILLARD WANT? ALL I KNOW IS, HE PUT ME AWAY. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STAY HERE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IF YOU LEAVE, MILLARD WILL KNOW WE'RE ON TO HIM. WELL... H-HOW LONG DO I STAY HERE? JUST UNTIL AFTER THE JUMP IS OVER TOMORROW. O.K. HEY, EVEL. WHAT? TAKE CARE OF TOMMY... TILL I CAN. YOU BET I WILL. [MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYS] BUENOS TARDES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. THAT MEANS GOOD AFTERNOON FROM SOUTH OF THE BORDER. WE'RE SPEAKING TO YOU FROM EL ESTADIO DEL SOL, THE STADIUM OF THE SUN, AND YOU'VE SEEN ON YOUR SCREENS, IT'S FIESTA TIME IN MEXICO. THIS VIBRANT, EXCITING, THRILL-SEEKING CROWD HAS TURNED OUT BY THE THOUSANDS FOR THEIR IDOL EVEL KNIEVEL. [CHEERING] WELL, I GUESS THEY LOVE A PARADE THE WORLD OVER, AND HERE IT COMES, THIS ONE BEING LED BY MEXICAN CABALLEROS RIDING THE FINEST HORSES THIS COUNTRY HAS TO OFFER. BUT WHEN CAN I SEE MY FATHER? WELL, I'M AFRAID YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO, UH, BE PATIENT, SON. HE, UM, HE HAS TO REGAIN HIS STRENGTH FIRST. CAN I TALK TO HIM? NO. NO, I'M SORRY. THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE. HE'S UNDERGOING A TERRIBLE ORDEAL. CAN I JUST SAY HELLO? MAYBE, UM... MAYBE NEXT WEEK. WILL YOU LEAVE A MESSAGE FOR ME? SURE. JUST SAY I LOVE HIM. THEY WON'T LET YOU SEE HIM, HUH? DID YOU FIND OUT ANYTHING? NO. THEY WON'T LET TOMMY SEE WILL. THEY WOULDN'T LET ME SEE HIM EITHER, BUT I DID LAST NIGHT. HOW IS HE? DON'T WORRY. HE'S GOING TO BE O.K. AS SOON AS THIS JUMP'S OVER, I'M GOING TO PAY ANOTHER VISIT TO THAT SANITARIUM AND GET HIM OUT. HOW? LET ME HANDLE THAT. DON'T YOU WORRY. THAT'S THE END OF THE PARADE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. YOU CAN FEEL THE EXCITEMENT BUILD AS THIS CROWD EAGERLY AWAITS EVEL KNIEVEL. EVEL? YEAH. I WANT YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING. WHAT'S THAT? SUDDENLY, I HATE MY ASSIGNMENT. YEAH? WHY? I DON'T WANT TO SHOOT YOUR LAST JUMP. I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE A LAST JUMP. THAT'S THE NICEST THING YOU'VE SAID. THANKS. YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, YOU HEAR? YEAH, I WILL. MAYBE NOW I'LL HAVE A BETTER REASON TO. [CROWD CHEERS] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'VE NEVER FELT ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. THERE'S ELECTRICITY IN THE AIR HERE BECAUSE THIS IS EVEL KNIEVEL'S FIRST APPEARANCE IN MEXICO. [BUZZ] YEAH? ARE YOU READY? READY AND WAITING. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, EVEL KNIEVEL HAS ALREADY TURNED THIS CROWD INTO A PERSONAL CHEERING SECTION. HE'LL NEED ALL THE WELL-WISHERS HE CAN GET BECAUSE HE'S JUMPING OVER 150 FEET OF BURNING FIRE. A MISTAKE WILL COST HIM HIS LIFE. THAT WAS GREAT. THANKS, TOMMY. THAT BABY READY TO GO? SURE IS. IT'S TIME TO GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD. CAN'T KEEP THE CUSTOMERS WAITING. TIME TO GO FOR BROKE. [STARTS ENGINE] DON'T FORGET YOUR HELMET. THANKS. [SPEAKING SPANISH] THAT FIRE YOU'VE JUST SEEN IS OVER 100 FEET OF FLAMING DEATH. EVEL'S GOING TO JUMP IT IN JUST HIS ORDINARY LEATHERS. HE JUST HAS TO MAKE IT. I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS JESSIE AGAIN. GO AHEAD. WE'RE IN MEXICO. WE'VE GOT KNIEVEL, THANKS TO JESSIE, BUT JESSIE IS A JUNKIE. I DON'T TRUST JUNKIES. MEANWHILE, YOU PROMISE TO MAKE HIM NUMBER ONE JUMPER. I SAY WE GET RID OF HIM. TAKE IT EASY. JESSIE IS FINISHED. NORMAN, YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT. ALL RIGHT. END OF THE LINE, EVEL. [SHUTS MOTOR OFF] WHAT'D YOU SAY? END OF THE LINE, MAN. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE AT THE OTHER END. NOT ANYMORE. TODAY IT'S MY SHOT AT THE GLORY. I'M MAKING THIS JUMP. THOSE PEOPLE PAID THEIR PESOS TO SEE ME JUMP. NO, WAY, MAN. I'M JUMPING. I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN I WAS BETTER THAN YOU. TODAY I'M GOING TO PROVE IT. HEY, YOU BEEN SMOKING SOMETHING? YOU'RE HIGH. MAN, BABY, YOU OUGHT TO GET HIGH. MILLARD WANTS TO KILL YOU AND WILL. HE EVEN THINKS HE'S GOING TO KILL ME. WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? MILLARD BROUGHT YOU HERE TO TAKE YOUR BODY BACK TO THE UNITED STATES AS COVER FOR $50 MILLION WORTH OF COCAINE. I GOT TO JUMP. I'VE NEVER SEEN EVEL TAKE THIS MUCH TIME BEFORE. [TRANSLATING INTO SPANISH] SOMETHING'S WRONG. HE PROMISED TO BE CAREFUL. NOW WHAT'S THE DELAY? I DON'T KNOW. TAKE IT EASY. [ENGINE STARTS] [CROWD CHEERS] HERE HE COMES. EVEL KNIEVEL, RIDING TOWARD TRIUMPH OR TRAGEDY. OH, MY GOD. NO, TOMMY! NO! THAT HAD TO BE ONE OF THE WORST CRASHES EVEL'S EVER TAKEN. [SILENCE] JESSIE. [TELEPHONE BUZZES] YEAH. HE'S DEAD, ALL RIGHT. IT AIN'T KNIEVEL. IT'S JESSIE. WHAT IS IT? JESSIE TOOK THE JUMP, NOT EVEL. JESSIE IS DEAD. HOW'D THAT HAPPEN? HOW DO I KNOW? MAYBE JESSIE BLEW THE WHOLE THING TO KNIEVEL. GET TO HIM BEFORE HE GETS TO THE COPS. RIGHT. AND, NORMAN, STOP HIM COLD. GET DOWN THERE AND GET WILL'S KID AND THAT DAME WITH HIM IN CASE WE NEED LEVERAGE. [SIREN] COME ON. WE'LL TAKE MY CAR TO THE HOSPITAL. THOMPSON, THIS IS MILLARD. THAT PATIENT IN SOLITARY, I WANT HIM TO HAVE THE MOST COMPLETE TREATMENT POSSIBLE. I CAN HANDLE THAT. NOW, JUST DISMISS HIM FROM YOUR MIND. SECURITY, NOW! ON THE DOUBLE! GO! HOW'S MY KID? FINE, EXCEPT FOR WORRYING ABOUT YOU. WHERE IS HE? PROBABLY BACK AT THE HACIENDA BY NOW. LET'S GET MOVING SO WE CAN STOP HIM FROM WORRYING! CAN YOU HURRY IT UP? ALMOST FINISHED. GOOD. BRING JESSIE OUT. [ENGINE STALLING] OH, NO! DON'T WORRY. WE'RE ALMOST THERE, OLD BUDDY. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU STOPPING FOR? HEY, I'M SEEING DOUBLE. WHAT'S MILLARD AFTER? COME ON. LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. [ENGINE STARTS] COME ON. HURRY UP. IT'S TOMMY! WILL, HOLD IT. HOLD IT! THERE'S SIX GUNS AGAINST ONE. WE NEED THOSE BIKES. WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE UNLESS WE LOWER THE ODDS. GET THEM IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. NORMAN, GET THE RIG HOOKED UP. GET UP THERE, LADY. INSIDE. [ENGINE STARTS] BILL, GET EVEL KNIEVEL'S TRAILER IN THE DESERT AND LOSE IT. WE'LL SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. YES, SIR. ALL SET. MOVE IT OUT. O.K. HI, BOYS. GET IN THERE. GET IN THERE. COME ON, GOON. LET'S MOVE IT. GET IN THERE. WHAT DO YOU THINK KNIEVEL WILL DO? WHEN HE FINDS OUT KATE AND TOMMY ARE GONE, HE'LL COME AFTER US. THAT'S WHAT I'M COUNTING ON. I'LL LET THE PORSCHE SEE ME AND DRAW THEM OFF. YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF THOSE GOONS IN THE TRUCK. RIGHT PLAN, WRONG PLAYER. I'LL TAKE THE PORSCHE. YOU'LL BE AS GOOD AS DEAD. I KNOW. WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE? I WOULDN'T HAVE A CHANCE AGAINST THOSE HOODS IN THAT TRUCK. ALL RIGHT, LOOK. TAKE THIS. THAT'LL HELP EVEN THE ODDS. GO ON. YOU CAN DO IT. SAVE MY KID, PARTNER. YOU BET I WILL. THERE'S SOMEONE BEHIND US. SEE WHO IT IS. IT'S KNIEVEL! NO, THAT'S ATKINS. WILL ATKINS. DROP HIM. KILL HIM! THAT'S IT! WILL'S FINISHED. MILLARD WILL SEE TO THAT. HOLD IT STEADY! WELL, THAT'S ONE DOWN AND ONE TO GO. NOW LET'S GET KNIEVEL. KNIEVEL! WHAT WAS THAT? HOW THE HELL DO I KNOW? WELL, I BETTER PULL OVER. NO, YOU KEEP ON MOVING. MILLARD SAID NOT TO STOP FOR ANYTHING. I'LL GO TAKE A LOOK. HEY! EVEL. EVEL! I THOUGHT YOU CRASHED. WHAT HAPPENED? DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. HOW ARE YOU DOING? HOW YOU DOING, HUH? ARE YOU O.K.? I HATE CRYERS. DID YOU GET MY DAD OUT OF THE SANITARIUM? SURE DID, BUT HE WENT AFTER THE PORSCHE. IS HE ALL RIGHT? I THINK SO, BUT WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT TO FIND OUT. THAT'S ALL I'VE EVER DONE, JUST SIT AND WAIT. DON'T WORRY, TOMMY. HE'LL BE O.K. YOU STAY HERE. TOMMY, I NEED A HAND FROM YOU. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT GOON STAYS DOWN. COME WITH ME A MINUTE. GIVE ME THE DOOR, TOMMY. WE'LL LOCK HIM IN HERE. WATCH YOUR HAND. NOW, YOU TWO, COME WITH ME. LET'S GO. NOW, LOOK. DON'T WORRY. I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOUR DAD. LOOK, THE BOTH OF YOU, REMEMBER WHAT I SAID. STAY BEHIND THIS HILL UNTIL I COME BACK. DON'T COME OUT FOR ANYBODY. HE'S PLAYING GAMES WITH US. I'LL SHOW HIM GAMES. AAH! AAH! GET HIM! COME ON! COME ON! [GUNSHOT] AAH! AAH! LOOK! WHERE? OVER THERE, BY THE ROCKS. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING. RIGHT THERE. IT'S YOUR IMAGINATION. NO. DAD! DAD! TOMMY! SON! TOMMY! TOMMY. OH, TOMMY. [MOTORCYCLE] OH, EVEL, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, I HAD A COUPLE OF THINGS TO TAKE CARE OF, BUT I DIDN'T FIND WILL. HE'S O.K. WILL FOUND US! HEY, THEY FINALLY FOUND EACH OTHER. LIKE WE DID? GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.
