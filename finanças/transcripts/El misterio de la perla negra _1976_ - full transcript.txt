Take me, take me! I can't waste more time, the ship is about to leave and those people are surely aboard Good luck Santo, and I congratulate you for your work here Thank you Let's go I'm sure he has the pearls with him It'd be a shame if the leader escaped What will happen to the girl? It's very likely she'll be found guilty, maybe three or four years I understand The ship's just arrived, let's go over there Andres Cortez? My, what a small world Would you come with me? You too Miss Go on, and forgive the inconvenience. I'm sorry but you're also a suspect This is too much Follow me We'll check this luggage, you check the lady What?

We don't have enough proof What do you plan to do? The wildcat, upon being set free, will search for prey You can count on our help Thank you, but I'm on vacation and would rather work alone - Goodbye gentlemen - Goodbye You know what you have to do with Wu Li Now we must seperate Be very careful, it's better if she doesn't know Agreed, I'll wait for you on the ship Keep an eye on her Thank you Miss. Santo, is that you? It's Wu Li Wu Li? I just got your report I'm being closely watched. I'll wait for you in an hour at the docks, I think this is the end - Listen- - I can't They're over there Wu Li has disappeared, she's surely betrayed us It's possible. Could she be with Santo? He'll find out where the pearls are Come, get on quickly We have to find her, if not they'll get the drop on us Yes, we have to hurry Let's go As soon as I get the pearls we'll go into hiding, we'll return to Spain later It's better if they don't see us We have to act without getting too close Try to get back as soon as possible, the ship is about to set sail We have to hurry - You have to go after him - Yes They're finally in our grasp We have to get back quickly, let's return to the docks Give me the pearls What are you doing? We've finally gotten away from all of them, including your good friend Santo The boss' accomplices worry me I'll get off in Barcelona like nothing happened, they'll think the boss ran away with everything In the meantime I'll make sure our package isn't lost And no one will suspect you I'll spend some time in Spain, and then I'll follow you to Geneva For now we must avoid being seen together I think some sun would do us good, but first let's have a drink, - does that sound good? - Alright I'll call the waiter Listen, bring us a cold bottle of champagne and two glasses. Thank you Two little angels, and I trusted one of them Come in. The waiter is here Good day ladies, you ask and I'll serve Would you like a bit of champagne? I assure you there's nothing better to lift your spirits Alright, we'll talk a bit while you get some sun Thank you Take note, I want to send a telegram Yes sir Police Chief, Mexico City, Federal District The time is perfect and the voyage magnificent, I ask for permission to take my vacation I am in the pleasant company of two lovely ladies who have also earned themselves a long vacation on the state's tab with all expenses paid. That's all, thank you Very well Ladies, to your health. Have a nice trip and take advantage of the sun since you'll be in the shade for a long time The End
