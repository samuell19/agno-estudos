MONEY Inspired by Tolstoy's The Counterfeir Bill What is it? It's the first of the month. I need to pay back someone at school too. My friend's parents give them a lot more. Norbert, leave me now, please. Shit. What's wrong? Dad won't give me an advance. I have to pay Gontran back. I can't help you today. Martial, is that you? I need help. I'm coming over. Forget that. Look. What do you think? Nothing. It's fake. Not bad. - Take it. - What for? They're easy to pass off. Don't worry. I'll go with you. You really think so? If you've got a second... The body is so beautiful. Let's go. - Where? - I know where. We'd like a nice frame, not too expensive. May we see the one in the window? You like it? - Yes. Then buy it. No student discount? You must be joking. It's already a bargain. You paying? Worried it's fake? Can you see the dark markings? I think so. No question about it. Besides, your father gave it to you. - No, he didn't. Sure he did. You really have nothing smaller? No, I'm sorry. If you don't want it, we'll go somewhere else. Thank you, ma'am. You fool! Idiot! They looked honest. I've told you a dozen times: Paris is full of these. I refused one just yesterday. You were there. But you accepted two the other day. I'll pass them on. Hi. - Here. - Thanks. This one's no good. What about this one? No good either. This one? Then I'll take them back where I got them and get others. No, I'm keeping them. What gives you the right? You're one of those crooks spreading counterfeit bills. Do I know this man? I'll ask my assistant. You recognize me? I gave you the invoice. This one here. Here's the copy. Forgive us for bothering you, gentlemen. Let's go. They're crazy. This matter isn't over yet. Think back. Maybe you were mistaken. How could I have been? Something has to be done. Like what? Go find out. The bills were clearly counterfeit. We'll pay the restaurant, and they'll probably drop the charge. As for the photo shop, your boss has to see your name cleared. It's only right. Go ahead. I've never seen this man in the shop. And outside the shop? Neither inside nor outside the shop. Do you have anything more to add? Nothing, Your Honor. I accepted this case, Your Honor, in outrage at the despicable way my client was cheated. Yvon Targe... I dismiss this case and hold you liable for costs, but the other party has graciously waived them. I urge you to show more caution before accusing decent people again and to be grateful for the leniency shown you today. What's wrong? I couldn't go back on what I'd said. How could I let two kids fool me? That's what I can't stomach. Lucien was terrific. Buy yourself that nice suit you want. What can perjury get you if you're caught? Nothing. Don't worry. I see. If you explained, I'm sure they'd take you back. I won't go crawling to them like a dog. I passed by yesterday. The prices were different. - Really? - I'm sure of it. The owner's out. I'll find out for you tomorrow. Never mind. I'll take it anyway. - Don't bother. - That's all right. I assume you won't deny it and that this isn't the first time. No, but I thought dishonest people had an understanding. I won't press charges. Believe me, Lucien... it saddens me to ask you to leave. I'll leave, sir, and I'll be sad to go. You said he was a good guy. I'll be a good guy when I'm rich. - Look. - The key to the safe. And the shop. Perfect copies. The principal? He's out, but I'm the chaplain. I can relay a message. I don't know the boy's name, but you must know him. Let's set aside the wedding at Cana and discuss these counterfeit bills. If one of you is guilty, which I find hard to believe, there's nothing worse than feigning innocence. It's better not to hide. Confess and repent. What does Christian think? Nothing. Geoffrey? I don't know. Norbert? Me? Not a word to your father. The principal will certainly tell him. Deny everything. Stand your ground. Understand? Yes, Mother. Then it's understood about my son? I promise not to mention his name. Let me make up for the bother this ridiculous matter has caused. - No. - I insist. I don't want you going out. This is absurd. I can't loan you money, but I have a proposal for you. Stop between these two streets, turn the car around, and wait there. - That's all? - That's all. You don't like me asking questions, but I have a right to worry. If he was hurt, he'd be in the hospital. Can't you tell me anything? He's in prison. You probably won't be allowed to visit or write him before the trial. All rise. This court is in session. Bring in the accused. The court will now deliver its decision. We find you guilty as charged by a majority of eight. As for whether circumstances mitigate in your favor, we determine that they do. In view of our decision, and in view of Articles 379, 381, and 59-60 of the Penal Code, this court, after due deliberation, sentences Yvon Targe to three years in prison and orders him to pay costs or serve a minimum additional term. You now have five days to appeal this ruling. Take the prisoner away. This court is adjourned. Targe, to the visiting room. That's all you have to say? Say something. Remember, Yvon: We parted without ever having fought. When I get out, I'll work as hard as I can. The three of us will start over. Where are you going? Come back! OUT OF SERVICE Don't hang around here. - Did it work? - No, but I have the card and code. I saw it clearly: 3876. But if I leave those two strips there, they'll be onto us, and it won't work ever again, in any machine. “...in the evening she was suffocating. The doctor came during the night. They decided to operate here instead of at the hospital. It was too late. Our little Yvette died of diphtheria on the 10th at 4:00 p.m. That's what I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't say the words. I'll stop here. I'm crying too much to write.” We fear death because we love life. I hoped to save the business, but competition's opened across the street. We've been limping along ever since the robbery. You know who robbed us? Lucien, our old assistant. Him? He was a crook. He lied so casually in court. Unbelievable. It seems he's rich now and gives money to the poor. Incredible amounts. At least that's what I hear. “You played a nasty trick on me with those counterfeit bills. I played an even nastier one on Yvon. But I forgive you. Accept this check from your former assistant.” Incredible. Incredible. RETURN TO SENDER Meat for cigarettes. What are they all staring at? Lay off him! His letters to his wife are being returned. That's not true. We're worried. Another woman who can't live without a man. And some hanky-panky. They'll all the same. Do you know who stole her? I wouldn't advise that. Is he worked up? No, he's calm. In here, a man who's never killed can be more dangerous than a serial killer. You grabbed the skimmer. Then what did you do? Nothing. You think I meant to kill the guard? Yes. What's your version? It's on that paper. You raised the skimmer above his head. If another guard hadn't stepped in, you'd have smashed his skull. No, sir. Solitary confinement, 40 days. “We won't meet again. Yvon, I've decided to begin a new life.” HOLD What time is it? 6:00 on the dot. Wednesday or Thursday? Wednesday. Stay calm. I'll be back. Take this. Another? Don't mind me. I always pray for the ones who kill themselves. How are you feeling, Yvon? You should have known you'd be caught. I trusted to luck. The money you stole - Without bloodshed, Your Honor. Was it out of idealism, to redistribute it? I'm a generous man. The court is aware of your opinions, and of your weakness for fancy suits. Do you plead guilty to fraud and theft? Given the circumstances of my so-called thefts, and in accord with new ideas... Just answer our questions. ...that say there are no rules anymore, I hoped to be acquitted, or, if sentenced, to escape and continue. I fear your words may turn the judges' minds against you. Justice may be against you, but it's your birthright to be like other men. Ever since you've become self-aware and seen how absurdly the world works and the impossibility of it ever changing, what have they told you? “Obey . Stay out of what doesn't concern you. Wait. Everyone will be happy soon.” Well, I'm not waiting around for universal happiness, which, believe me, will be boring as hell. I want to be happy now, in my own way. O money, God incarnate, what wouldn't we do for you? Show me your legs. It's mostly a weakness in my knees. It's just the Valium. It'll pass. Is Yvon in there? Is that you? A guy named Lucien says to meet him at mass. Don't go. I'll get you out of here. I'm serious. I know a way. The room where they store the burlap sacks. I have a plan. I'll take care of you to make up for what I did. I swear to God on anything you want. I'd kill you before I'd leave with you. Neither of us is a killer, probably the only ones here with no one on their conscience. You have me on your conscience, and now you'll pay for it. It's him - Lucien. Of course. He bragged openly about tearing his cell apart. We all knew when he'd carry out his plan. His time isn't over. They'll take him to rot in higher-security prisons. We'll never see him again. - I will. Yvon, one takes revenge on those higher up. Why stoop to crushing that louse? You've already been avenged without doing a thing. Someone fond of you protects you from afar. A relative or friend. I have no relatives, no friends... and no wife. “We won't meet again. Yvon, I've decided to begin a new life.” Never mind. Just toe the line. You get out soon. I want to see you in good shape. Stop it. You won't smash the door, only your fist. I wouldn't let it humiliate me like that. Couldn't you rebel some simpler way? You're a real pain. Sit down. I'm hungry, but I can go without. Why did you kill? One kills for a reason. It gave me pleasure. I didn't take much, and I already spent it all. I remember every detail. He fell splayed out by the door. She tried to grab the knife. Their appearance made me sick. - You didn't go back to revive them? - I'm not a doctor. You'll be forgiven. If I were God, if it were up to me, I'd forgive everyone. Don't worry. My sister and her husband, the boy's parents. They use the other door and sleep on that side of the house. I usually make lunch for them too. My other sister doesn't come home every night. Her room's on the top floor. You're good people. I know you won't turn me in. Father, let me by. - I'll tell him to leave. - Let me handle it. Go away, please. - You don't know him. You fool! You deserve - When my husband died, he began drinking and lost his pupils. It's my fault. I couldn't control him. Before that, he was good. He respected his family. Where are you going? I'll be back. And they strike you. You do all the work yourself. You slave away for them. Why not just throw yourself in the river? Do you expect a miracle? I expect nothing. Where's the money? I killed the hotel owners to rob them, and I just killed a whole family.
