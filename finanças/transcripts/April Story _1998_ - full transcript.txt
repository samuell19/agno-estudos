Hideyoshi, that villain! We're all but done for! I can go no further... My lord! You must not give in to weakness! My rule was short, but I regret nothing! The time is changing. This age of war will end. One day a time of peace will come. And that is my dream, My prayer! That is the reason you killed Nobunaga Oda... ...at Honnoji Temple! Hideyoshi is but an upstart. No son of his will succeed him. And so who will rule... ...in the new age of peace... Yes. Ieyasu Matsudaira. A shame to commit my dream to him, but he will make it come true. Mitsuhide! Who goes there?! A dream like that sits ill upon one such as you! Nobunaga! - This cannot be! - A ghost! You think I did not expect treachery? What?! How could Hideyoshi so quickly take the field? Then the man who died at Honnoji Temple was a double? Not a double. That was Ieyasu. - Ieyasu?! - Ieyasu, you say?! Ieyasu Matsudaira?! He died for me as Nobunaga Oda. And I will take power and rule under his name. You will be Ieyasu?! But why such an intrigue? When this era ends, Ieyasu will rule as Shogun in Edo. There was no other way I could take power. How do you know that? Enough! You can think about that in hell. It is my own sword that will send you there. Villain! Keep away! Damn empty cans! - What day are you closed? - Tomorrow. Hey! Here! Here! Look! This is yours! - Have you decided what club to join? - Not yet. How about fishing? Fishing? You mean fishing as in...fishing? It's fun. 'The Japanese Economy and the Movement to Direct Investment'. Turn in your reports next class. There's different kinds of fishing. What we do is 'fly-fishing'. Have you ever heard of it? It's a kind of stream-fishing, but you use these artificial lures. Could you touch a worm? Of course not! You're a girl. But even a girl won't have any problem with these lures. It suits you. I'll give it to you. Did you see the film 'A River Runs Through It'? Brad Pitt was in it. - I saw it. - You did? That's fly-fishing. Doesn't Brad Pitt get killed by a bear at the end? No, he doesn't get killed by a bear... Anyway, if you join now, you get your own brand-new free fishing rod. Wow! An Obis #4! That's not a beginner's rod, you know. Well? There they are! What are they all fishing for here? They're practicing! You've got a real arm there. - I do? - Yeah. Let me see... You should have a different reel. It's like rhythm gymnastics. - Like that... - Thank you. An Obis #4 needs a CFO #3 reel. This is the best of the best. I'll lend it to you for a while. Do you have any friends who might want to fish? Sorry? You can have that reel for free if you introduce a friend. Saeko... - 'Morning. - 'Morning. What's your first class? Cultural Anthropology. Mine's History. - I can't come to the club today. - Oh... Sorry. See you later. - Do you want to quit the club? - No. - You sure? - Yes. Excuse me... Sorry... Sorry again... Here it is. 5,000 yen change. - Would you like a cover? - No, thanks. OK. - Yes? - Would you like to have dinner with me? Sorry? I made too much curry... Sorry. I've already eaten. Oh...all right, then. Yeah...fishing. Strange? You think so? I just wanted to do something new. Here? It's warm. It's like summer. It cools off at night. Someone's at the door. Just a minute. Coming! Is something wrong? I just thought I shouldn't have said no like that before. That's OK. If you've made too much, it seems like a shame to waste it. No, that's all right. - Are you sure? - Yes. If there's any left over, I'd be happy to have some. You would? Thank you! Yes, come in, please. Please. Here. - Your door's a different color than mine. - It is? This way. Thank you. Oh, just a minute. Please, sit down. Here, I'll do that. Thanks. It's a nice room. A real student's apartment. Hello? Sorry... No. The woman from next door. I'll call you back later, OK? Yoshie? Yeah, I know her... Really? Fukatsu's cool, isn't he. Which one is he? The club president! - Oh... - Well? Do you have a boyfriend? A boyfriend in Hokkaido? Someone you liked? It was unrequited. Same as me! What was he like? - Really cool. Smart. - Smart? Yeah. Real smart. You like smart guys? Not especially... Yamazaki went off to university in Tokyo last spring. I was devastated. Yamazaki Musashino University Have you ever heard of 'Musashino'? The university in Tokyo? It's famous. Are you applying there? Musashino University, Tokyo. My friend Onoda Natsuko said it was famous. The sound of 'Musashino' reminded me of him. Musashino'...'Musashino'... I read Musashino by Kunikida Doppo. I didn't really understand it. But after that the place, the name 'Musashino'... ...rang in me like a summons. Musashino'...'Musashino'... The image of him in an open field strumming his guitar... ...was fixed in my mind like a picture in a frame... ...that was screwed to the wall and wouldn't come off. Uzuki! I spent the summer studying for my entrance exam. A friend who'd been down to Tokyo came to see me. Musashino Guess who put the cover on that book. Yamazaki! On the brown paper cover... ...was the name of a bookstore: 'Musashino-do'. He's working part-time there. Yeah? Thanks. I love him... This writer, I mean. Wandering in my own Musashino... ...I'd stumbled on the place he was. 'Musashino-do' in Musashino. I dedicated that last six months of my high-school years... ...to 'Musashino'. Hello. Um... Yes? Could I see this book, please? The one with the yellow back. This one? - Here. - Thanks. Hi. Um... You didn't happen to go to North High School, did you? Yes, I did. Yeah! You were a year behind me. You remember me? Yeah...your name was... Uzuki. Uzuki Nireno. Why are you here? - University. - Here in Tokyo? Yes. Musashino. Yeah? Me, too. What do you know! That's 2,930 yen. From 3,030 yen. You live near here? Yes. Well, drop in again. Yes...l will. It's started to rain... Well, see you. I'll lend you an umbrella. That's OK, thanks. It's not far. Well, Sensei, let's have dinner sometime. Mr. Kato! Do you have an umbrella? - Is it raining? - It's pouring! It's really coming down! No umbrella? Here, use this. No, that's OK. They'll have another one inside. Could I borrow it for just a minute? I'll go buy one. I'll be right back! Mr. Yamazaki! What's wrong? Maybe I will borrow an umbrella. The rain's gotten worse. You've got one. Oh, this... I borrowed it across the street. Hang on... People forget them. Take whichever you like. OK, this one. I knew it! I knew you'd take that one. 'Bye. Wait a minute! That one's broken. Don't worry. No, wait a minute... This one's fine. How about this? Too bright? This one's fine. Really. Are you still in a band? No. How did you know I was in a band? You were famous. I was? With me. I'll bring this back. Forget it. I'll bring it back. OK. Good thing you went to buy one. They only had the one. Thank you. Did you find that on the street? Yeah... 'Bye. Thank you very much! When I made it into university... ...my home-room teacher said it was a miracle. But if it was a miracle... ...I want to call it a miracle of love.
