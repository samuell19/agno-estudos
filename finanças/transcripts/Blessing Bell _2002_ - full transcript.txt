Can I also go there? I've always been evil. Violence,... ...blackmail, theft,... ...well, actually it's normal for being a Yakuza. I've seen both the paradise and the hell of this world. The hell was so terrible... ...so I wondered how terrible the real hell could be. And that made me scared. Maybe that's because of age. And suddenly, I felt like doing something good. Then only once... ...only once... ...I can do something good. You know what? That's donating organs. My body... ...is so strong... ...by nature. And... ...the procedure is already done. But it's a wound. Does it really work? Does it... Damm. Dammit! I'm... I... What am I doing here? Why are you here? I commited murder. How long is a murderer imprisoned? Shit! Do you know the bar "Chance"? "Chance" in front of the station. My wife was a hostess there, without telling me. She had a boyfriend there. A waiter. I couldn't stand that. That asshole! I still can feel it when I stabbed him. I felt so good! So refreshed! The guy looked dazed. Like an idiot. They made a fun of me. Why didn't I... Shit! Shit! Why... Why didn't I... ...kill my wife, too? That bitch must be flirting with another guy now! Shit! Shit... Shit... Hey! You can go home now. Why are you leaving already? You can stay more, ya? I have to work tomorrow early in the morning. Then, will you go out with me next time? Where? Hot spring! Hot spring? That's a good idea. Ya? You promise? But... is it really OK? Your husband would be jealous. No problem. What? Then... this? Right! So everything is OK. Hey, go out with me! Please! - Well... OK! - Hurray! Which do you like? Beach or mountain? I want to take an open-air bath! With me? You kidding! Disgusting! Well... I wanna eat sea urchin... and crab... And after that... Oh, what a pity! Her kids are still small, right? Ya, 3 and 2 years old. Firemen are so late. What are they doing? Fire's coming to my house! Hurry up! Testimonial for Igarashi Satoru! At the scene of the fire last night... ...you saved a child's life, forgetting the danger,... ...we all appreciate you and award this testimonial. Thank you. Waiting No. 25, please come to the room 7. It's you. What's that? So... you came here to boast it to me. What do you want from me? My wife? She got a new boyfriend, right? That bitch... 10 years. After 10 years in prison, I would be once released conditionally. 10 years... Until then, my wife will have been an old Ma'am. Are you married? Take care of your wife. Although taking too much care causes someone like me. You. Where are you hurt? You will be alright. You will be alright soon. I cannot old anymore. No one can do anything against life span. Are you happy? I was happy. Well,... ...many things happened,... ...but it was fun. What the happiness is... ...cannot be enjoyed alone. Do you understand? Is my sweetheart alright? ...That's only the thing I'm worried about. I'm sorry to bother you, but... ...can you visit her to see whether everything is alright? I'm so worried about her. Here is the address. Please. I... ...have the place to go now. I trust you. Doctor! EKG line is flat! - Bosmin! - Yes. Mr. Yokoi! Mr. Yokoi! Hold on! Mr. Yokoi! Mr. Yokoi! Can you hear me? Doctor, he's not back. Mr. Yokoi! Hold on! Mr. Yokoi! Can you hear me? Mr. Yokoi! Mr. Yokoi! Mr. Yokoi! - Can you hear me? - Mr. Yokoi! Excuse me. At the fire... Thank you so much. I cannot thank you enough. I... I appreciate your help. Do you often... ...come here? When... ...I lose confidence ...or when I'm depressed, I always come here. I always cared about how I'm looked like as a only parent of my child. I... ...couldn't do anything useful. I'm a bad mother. On that day, I was here. I thought of killing myself. If I died, I could escape from all the stressful things... I thought. Then it happened. I was punished by thinking such a thing. On this planet... ...there are so many people facing troubles. My trouble is such a small thing... I'm sorry. For stupid complaining. But I'm alright now. Since I met you, I can also be brave a bit. I have to be stronger. Oh my God. It's floating away. I'm so sorry. In 10 seconds. It's coming! Look! Over there. In the backside of the 5th car,... ...I was always there. For 30 years. What was I doing? Everyday... In the full train. I wanted to come here once. I thought of here for the place to die. I'm fired. But I can't do anything against it. I've just divorced. My daughter left the house. I can only talk politely like this. I'm a boring man. I'm so sad. I'm hurt. I feel so lonely. I can't stand it. I want to die. If I died, I could escape from everything. I came here to die. But I'm not brave enough for it. I can't do anything alone. I cannot do anything... But today, I'm not alone here. Well... What? Check. Pay it. What's that way of saying. - How much do you think you have charge account? - Shut up! - I didn't say that I wouldn't pay. - Then pay it. Ya, I pay it. I pay it, but... You... I have many troubles. So what? I also have many problems. You think I get this alcohol for free? - No joking! - What? I'm your customer! My customer? A customer who doesn't pay isn't a customer. Oh, ya? Then what? All you want is money or what? Money, money, money... What's so bad to talk about money? I'm not here for a volunteer. Don't call me like a money monster. Oh yeah? Who can be a money monster beside you! Pay it now! I don't pay! Excuse me.. - Hey, you! - What? - What do you think what I do for you? - I don't know it! - Excuse me... - What? That check... I pay it for him. What? Please let me pay. I have money if you want it. If I only get the check... ...No no. It's not about money. It's not about money at all. I just... I... I will get some big amount of money next week, ya? - Th... then I can pay for the check... - Shut up. I don't need it anymore. But... I have cancer. My doctor told me today. So I don't need them anymore. - But... - It's too late. One more. But it's not good for your health. I know. I mean to do it. I know... I take him. Welcome back. What? Hey! Wait!
