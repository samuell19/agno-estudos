Now there's nothing wrong with Carl going with you. - I don't have to take him! - [Woman] Look, I'm sick of arguing with you. Good grief, you're only 17 years old. - Only 17? Oh, that's wonderful, isn't it? You know how many times I've brought this moron? - You get to do a lot more things than I ever did at your age. - [Girl] Bloody only 17. - Don't be so cheeky. I will not be spoken to. - Look, I don't want to go, okay? - Julie doesn't have to take her little sister along with her. - Mom. Mom. You awake? Mom, I have to go now. I have to go. - Have you got everything? - Yeah. - You look great. Give us a kiss. Take care, darling. Have fun. - [Girl] Yeah. - [Boy] I'm off, Dad! - Hold it. Turn around. Right round. Stand up straight. Off you go. - Bye, Dad. - Bye. Have a nice time, son. - He'll ruin the whole weekend! - What the hell's going on here? - Dad, I don't have to take that pain, do I? - Would you please back me up on this? - [Girl] Dad. - Tanya, shut up.

Don't you understand what you did? You've killed a boy! I've just put him in the bottom of a bloody river! I've been chasing these kids around! Why do you believe in all this bullshit? This bullshit! - [Lise] Mac, I don't want to talk about that now, okay? - This bullshit. - [Lise] They'll be waiting for me. - Absolute bullshit. It's junk, it's not you, Lise. This is bullshit. - [Lise] Mac, don't. - [Mac] Oh, shit. - [Lise] I've got so many things. I just don't know where I'm gonna put everything. I mean, I don't think my suitcase is large enough, Mac. I just. - That is bullshit. Your little secrets are lies. - That is mine! And don't you dare touch it again! And don't you dare touch me again either 'cause you stink. The whole place stinks! - Yes, that's real. - And I hate the place and I hate you're bald and filthy. - Okay, that's real. - [Lise] I hate it! - That's lies. - I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, and I hate you! - Throw it away. Throw it away! Get rid of that bullshit! (crying) - And I hate myself. I hate me! (yells) - Lise. - No! No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no! - [Mac] Lise. No, no. Lise. Lise. Oh, my god. Easy now. Easy. Easy, girl. Easy. - We didn't take any food. But we didn't take any food. - Shut up. - [Julie] He must've seen we've got the gun. Maybe he'll stop now. - [Carl] No, he can't stop now. (Gray crying) - [Julie] Gray. It's all right. We're okay. - [Mac] You probably do, but just let me do it my way and we'll be all right. We'll see it through. No more secrets. No more lies, Lise. Tomorrow, it'll all be over. It'll just be another accident. Bunch of kids lost in the bush. Died of exposure. (tense music) - Hey. Up you get. Hey, Gray. Hey, what's the story, Gray? - [Tanya] Gray, come back! - [Gray] He killed Leon! - [Tanya] Carl, get the gun off him! - [Carl] Come on, Gray. Take it easy. - [Tanya] Get the gun! - [Carl] Hey, Gary. Slow up. - [Tanya] Gray, stop! (grunts) - Whoa. - You, stop. You killed my mate Leon, eh? Didn't you? You tried to kill me. - [Julie] Don't threaten him. - Put the gun down. Leave the old man alone. Gray, come on. We don't want any more deaths, Gray. - Gray, put it down. - Please, Gray. Gray. - You fool. You're gonna get us killed. - Please, go away. Please, leave us. - [Carl] Put the gun down, Gray. - Get off your horse. Get off your horse. - [Carl] Come on, put it down. - Get down off your horse! Get down! Get back. - Just give me back my gun, boy. - [Tanya] Shoot him! - [Julie] Shut up. - [Mac] Give me the gun. - [Tanya] You're insane, idiot. - Don't do it. Don't do it, okay? Don't do it! Get back. - Stay put, Lise. - Go back! (gun cocks) - Gray, don't! (gun fires) (tense music) - [Gray] I got one. - [Tanya] Leave him. - [Gray] I got one. I got one. Yoo-hoo! I got one! I got one! Woo-hoo! I got one! - [Carl] He's not coming, Gray. He's not coming. - [Tanya] What's he doing? - [Carl] He's just hanging onto her. (grunts) - [Tanya] Gray. Gray, come on. Get up. Come on. - [Carl] Come on, we'd better keep moving. - [Tanya] We can't stop now. (Gray groaning) - I just killed her. I just killed her. I just killed her. - Yeah, so you killed someone, Gray. Don't like it much, huh? So, why don't you give me the gun? So that way you won't do it again accidentally or something like that. See, it's happened now, eh? You've gotta accept you've done it. Can't undo it. Just got to learn to live with it, eh? (dogs panting) (gun firing) (tense music) (dramatic music) (grunts) - [Tanya] Gray, we're not gonna wait for ya. Come on! (gasping) We can't stop now. - [Julie] Come on, Gray. - [Gray] I can't. - [Carl] Okay, we'll stop. Just for a bit. (horse whinnies) - [Gray] Look out! Get out of here! (gun fires) - [Tanya] Come on, let's go! Hurry up! - [Julie] Come on! - [Gray] Come on! (horse whinnying) (gun cocks) - Carl, come on! Let's go! (gun clicks) - Tanya, it's the jeep! - Come on. (grunts) - [Julie] Get up! (breathing heavily) - Get down! - [Gray] Julie! (gun fires) (Julie screams) - Gray! - Gray! Jesus Christ, he's dead. He's still reloading. 'Cause of one arm, he's really slow. We've got to do something. - [Tanya] We'll never make it. - Ah, yeah? - Is it time? - I don't know. (gun fires) There's no time. I can't do that, no way. Are you crazy? I'll never make it, man. There's no way. - Yes, you can. We'll make him shoot again. - What? - You can do it. - No, I can't. - You can. Listen to me. As soon as he fires. - What? - As soon as he fires, you go for gold. (gun cocks) - No, don't, man. Don't do it, okay? - I love you. - What? Tanya! (gun fires) Tanya! - [Tanya] Now! (dramatic music) (gun fires) (gun cocking) (gun fires) (sighs) (subdued music)
