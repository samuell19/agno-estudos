Fran√ßois, my love... ...this is my 14th letter, but you've yet to see one. 20th day at sea. Feeling foggy and overfed. It's all so crazy. Fired at 950 metres. Targeted aft mast. Crew, assumed rescued, was still on board. Survivors swam toward U-96. U-96 withdrew from survivors. We Build For Victory!
