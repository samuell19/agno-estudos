Music hath charms that nothing else has Music hath charms, though it's classic or jazz A symphony grand by Schubert or Brahms Popular bands or a uke 'neath the palms A melody in minor key can make the teardrops start And then again, a glad refrain can cheer a lonely heart Sweet harmony when there's someone in your arms Oh baby, it's then that music hath charms How do you do, ladies and gentlemen. Permit me to introduce myself. I'm Charles Irwin. And this book is Paul Whiteman's scrap book. Its pages are crowded with melodies and anecdotes... ...which we are going to bring to life for you by the magic of the camera. Here we have Paul himself. And by the way, you may be ineterested in knowing... ...how he came to be crowned the King of Jazz. Once upon a time, Paul, tiring of life in the great city... ...had a grand idea. He would go big-game hunting. No sooner said than done. Shooting the action to the camera... ...we find him a few weeks later... ...in darkest Africa. My Lord delivered Daniel, my Lord delivered Daniel... My Lord delivered Daniel... Why can't he deliver me?! Ouch! Mammy! And that's how Paul Whiteman was crowned... The King of Jazz. Why, here comes Paul himself. - Hello, Charlie. - Hello, Paul, where's the band? Are you standing in front of them? - Oh, the band? - Yes. I have them right in here. What, 40 boys in that little bag? In the bag! I'm really very proud of the boys. Some of them have been in the band a great many years. Mike, how long have you been in the band? 11 years, Mr Whiteman. Goldie, how long have you been in the band? 6 years, Pop. - 6 years pop? - Pop. He's been in the band so long he's commenced to look like me. However, as I said before, I'm really very proud of the boys collectively... And I'd like to have you meet them individually. Now that you know the boys... I want you to meet our girls! Here's my faded orange blossom, white as driven snow... Fashioned with such loving care long centuries ago... Worn in every generation by some happy bride... Hiding modest blushes from the lover at her side... Dear treasure of the past... I've come for you at last... What are the secrets you hold... Within each delicate fold... What tender memories you could reveal... What dreams you seem to unfold of days romantic... While phantom lovers of old around me steal... How many hearts you have thrilled... What hopes you've quickened and filled... If you were only to tell the tale... And how I wish that I knew what joy or sorrow... I'll soon be finding in you, my bridal veil. Oh happy bride one wish through your happy moments We pray that happiness may/make ???? ever thine Happy couple(?) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Do you remember the path where we met...

Do, I wonder, dreams come true. we'll soon be on our way There endless bliss will be Awaiting you and me And how I wish that I knew what joy or sorrow... I'll soon be finding in you, my bridal veil. Here's my assignment, boss. Say, where have you been all day... Your story's half an hour old. - What's the matter? - Matter?! If we women are gonna run this paper, I want speed. And as long as I'm City editor, I've got to have news hot off the griddle! Here you are, 40 storey building burnt to the ground. - When did it happen? - 10 minutes ago. - That's better. "Big bank robbery... Three policemen shot." - When did it happen? - 5 minutes ago. That's more like it. "Woman shoots husband." - When did it happen? - Wait a minute! - Listen... - That's great! What a dance do they do! Lordy, how I'm tellin' you... They don't need no band... They keep time by clappin' their hand... Just as happy as a cow chewin' on a cud, When the darkies beat their feet on the Mississippi Mud. Hey, Bing, this isn't the type of number for this kind of a production. What kind of a production is this? A super-super special-special production. Well, I guess you're right... We should get out of the mud... ...and reach for the higher, and the finer things of life. The silver lining and the bluebird... and life and love! Look at my doorstep, and look at my doorstep... and look at the bluebird, and look at the blackbird and at the bad bug. look at the good luck and the bad luck there I never saw bluebirds mingle with blackbirds I never saw bluebirds doing things backwards... Never knew good luck ever could perch with care Now, I overheard... those birdies talking... ...today, and I know just why they're acting this way. Maybe I'd better pick up the thread of the story. - Well you needn't. - OK. First, the bluebird said... "We've got to have sunny weather." So the bluebirds and the blackbirds... ...got together. Then the blackbird said... "All we birds have a different feather." So the bluebirds and the blackbirds... got together. Trouble, trouble, round my door... Blackbirds, blackbirds, by the score. - Pull it up now! Bluebirds, bluebirds came one day... And said to the blackbirds, "Hear our say" Say, who the dickens are these revellers? Oh, some quartet on the air... It really doesn't matter. Why, first the bluebird said... "We got to have sunny weather." So the bluebirds and the blackbirds got together. Then the blackbirds said "We're birds of a different feather." So the bluebirds and the blackbirds got together. And when they talked it over, they let the blackbirds bring the rain. All the bluebirds then agreed to bring that sunshine again... For we can't have rain or sunshine that lasts... ...forever. You can take those bluebirds, take those blackbirds... Mix them together you get fair weather... And that's the reason the bluebirds and the blackbirds got together. In my imagination I'm finding consolation Somewhere along the Rio Grande. Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing Someone along the Rio Grande. It happened in Monterey a long time ago. I met her in Monterey in old Mexico. Stars and steel guitars and luscious lips as red as wine Broke somebody's heart and I'm afraid that it was mine. It happened in Monterey without thinking twice. I left her and threw away the key to paradise. My indiscreet heart longs for the sweetheart That I left in old Monterey. Stars and steel guitars and luscious lips as red as wine Broke somebody's heart and I'm afraid that it was mine. My indiscreet heart longs for the sweetheart Yo soy la paloma errante Que vengo aqu?, Buscando un hermoso nido, Donde nac?. Si a tu ventana llega Una paloma... Tr?tala con carino Que es mi persona. !Ay! chinita que si! !Ay! que dame tu amor! !Ay! que vente conmigo, Chinita, a donde vivo yo! !Ay! chinita que si! !Ay! que dame tu amor! !Ay! que vente conmigo, Chinita, a donde vivo yo! It happened in Monterey a long time ago. I met her in Monterey in old Mexico. Stars and steel guitars and luscious lips as red as wine Broke somebody's heart and I'm afraid that it was mine. It happened in Monterey without thinking twice. I left her and threw away the key to paradise. My indiscreet heart longs for the sweetheart That I left in old Monterey. Now I've caught you! So this is the way you act when I'm not around! No use you trying to explain... I saw you with my own eyes. - Well ... well won't you let me...? - I'm through! You'll never see me again as long as you live. You brute! Goodbye! Well, wifey, there goes the best stenographer I ever had! One day, while Paul was away... And the boys in the band prevailed upon the probably man to do his stuff. Jack White, a fellow of infinite jest, but... Just a little bit nutty. Come on there, Old Black Joe! Yeah, Joe, come on and coo one, you'll be terific. Old Black Joe... When I was a little boy, my mother said to me... What did your mother say to you? When I grow up to be a big man, what do I wish to be? What do you wish to be? - 7 of spades? - Right! I always wanted to be a cop or a fireman or such. But since those days of wishin'... I've got a new ambition. What is your ambition? - Ace of clubs? - Right. Oh, how I'd like to own a fish store That's all I wish for... A lovely fish store. Why, to all the Paddys... I'd sell the fin and haddy. To the Cohens and the Misches I would sell gefilte fishes. I'd put a flounder in my window each day... I'd put it on a scale and say I'm giving it away. Oh, how I'd like to own a fish store I'm a fisherman... Aren't we all? I had a dream last night... ...I dreamt I saw two fishes fight. The champion was a tuna fish... His opponent was a bass... Before the title-fight began, they introduced a few... They introduced Kid Sharky... ...Battling White fish... And Piccolo Pete. - Ace of clubs? - Right! The house was packed with pole-fish, who paid 20 fish to get in. And how the men were yelling for the main fight to begin. Everyone's excited, and from the gallery, some fresh trout... C'mon you Tuna fish knock that sea bass out! The champion leads his left fin. He leads it to the jaw... He lands. The bass... he flounders... Catch on? Signals off. The bass went down, he can't get up. The champ was in his glory. And then I hoped to find my dream... ...was only a bedtime story. My fresh halibut fish... My fresh halibut fish... ...come down, at my fish take a peep. Only last night they were to sleep in the deep. Want any fish, baby? No, sir! - D'yer sister want any? - No, sir. Well, you know that fish gives you brains? What do you eat, sir? Sardines? And then the war broke out. Millions of men and boys... ...leaving their homes and wives and sweethearts. Men... men... men... men! Going up and down again... men! Men... going up and down... And where were you?! Where were you? And where were you? Where were you? Never mind me! They got me, buddy. Did they really get you? Yes, they really got me. Well, they should've got you sooner. Tell me your name. So I can tell your poor old mother. Why, you darned fool, my mother knows my name. Romeo and Juliet I'm quite sure didn't have to pet... ...upon a hardwood bench in the park like this is They had moonlight up above and and all the scene of Eden's love Things like that so helpful to hugs, and kisses... But you and I, my dear... Need no such atmosphere... A bench in the park... Unromantic and plain... That bench in the park can be our lovers' lane The glimmering light of a lamp for a moon A cold dreary night, but in our hearts there is June A lone little bird in the branches above Is plaintively heard serenading his love And what more do we need, you and I in the dark On a bench in the park. A bench in the park, unromantic and plain That bench in the park can be our lovers' lane The glimmering light of a lamp for a moon A cold dreary night, but in our hearts there is June A lone little bird in the branches above Is plaintively heard serenading his love And what more do we need, you and I in the dark A bench in the park. A lone little bird in the branches above Is plaintively heard serenading his love And what more do we need... you and I in the dark... On a bench in the park I beg your pardon, Sir... Is this the place where you report a stolen automobile? The Universal picture "All Quiet on the Western Front"... ...inspired us to produce our own little war drama... ..."All Noisy on the Eastern Front". In it, we hope to prove for all time... ...that Sherman was right. Come in! Marie... My big American baby! Have you been true to me? Hide! Quickly! Come in! Marie! Mon Capitain, you look so handsome! Soap! Smells good! Have you been true to me? Hide! Quickly! Come in! Marie darlin'! Mon petit Colonel! You are my jazz-baby, no? - Look what I got for you. - Chocolat! Yum yum! Marie, have you been true to me? Hide! Quickly! Come in! General! Marie... Have you been true to me? Need you ask me that, baby? The enemy is shelling the town. We must leave immediately. Come... my car is waiting. Have you got any room for me? How about me? How about me? How about us? No record of American music would be complete... ...without George Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue"... ...which was written for the Whiteman orchestra... ...and first played in the Aeolean Hall in 1924. The most primitive and most modern musical elements are combined in this rhapsody... For jazz was born in the African jungle... The beating of the voodoo drum. - Good evening, Mr. Kent. - Hello, Ike. - What are you gonna have? - Oh, I don't know. Most anything. What is that? Just what you ordered, most anything. Well, here's it all. Do you know what's the matter with this country? It's the tariff! That's who. Partly tariff and partly income tax. Now you take my wife... All right... Who you gonna take? Here's a go... Wait a minute... Don't kick that dog! That's not a dog. It's a cat. Then, don't kick the cat. Don't you like animals? - No. - Do you like goldfish? Goldfish? I hate 'em! Not so, quite... not so quiet My boy, don't ever let anybody hear you talk that way. A goldfish is one of the most faithful animals we have. To mankind. To the goldfish. Would you mind if I told you a story...? ...about 2 little goldfish that I once had. No. I bought 'em at a s'pawnshop. Two little wallahs for a wonderful heir. Goldfish. I called them Ella and Emma. I brought them home... ...and I put them in a glass bowl full of water. And I used to sit and watch them grow. Grow into womanh... to manh.. Big fish. Then, prohibition came. And they jumped out of the bowl onto the floor. They used to follow me around wherever I went. How I used to love them! I used to come home each night... And I'd stand at the bottom of the steps and I'd cry out... Halloo Ella! Halloo Emma! And they would answer me back... One day I... I'd been working pretty hard. I worked so hard I broke my shovel. I came home... And I stood at the bottom of the steps... And I cried out... Halloo Ella! Halloo Emma! But there was no... No...? Excuse me! Ella! Emma! Emma! A little tale we'll tell to you... About the love of someone who... We called the Ragamuffin Romeo He'd sigh and wail as lovers do When thinking of his sweetie too Poor little Ragamuffin Romeo In dreams only they had ever met And at dawn he'd awake Oh so lonely for his Juliet And then he would take His little sack and hit the road A-picking rags at each abode Poor little Ragamuffin Romeo. Happiness he found in sortin' patches Listen now for this is where the catch is His Lady Love he'd start making of rag Then he never used to be dejected... Doing what the fairy tale directed On the wall he'd tack 'em all and for a while he'd smile the blues away. There'll come a day, I really feel... we're gonna love in manner real My little Ragamuffin Romeo I'm always gay and never blue... I know that love will lead me too My little Ragamuffin Romeo. Until then, so happy we can be... and complainin' ain't right. Until then, I promise faithfully... To see you each night. And just as true as skies above His eyes are clear, by lit of love My little Ragamuffin Romeo. My Ragamuffin Romeo. This movin' picture business is a bunk... And this skin certainly gets my nanny! I feel like a horse's neck! Horse's neck? How do you suppose I feel? Good heavens, dear, this is terrible... look! The minister who married us wasn't a minister at all... A crook, an imposter! They've sent him to the penitentiary. Why this is awful... it means that we're not married. That's right, it makes me a bachelor. It makes me a spinster! What are you two squawking for...? Look what it makes me! When you find that your mind Keeps you worried and blue You can always let your feet Keep your disposition sweet I want to see What makes me feel the way I do? Will you kindly cast an eye On two good reasons why? Happy feet I've got those happy feet Give them a low down beat And they begin dancing I've got those ten little tapping toes And when they hear a tune I can't control my dancing heels To save my soul Weary blues... can't get in to my shoes Because my shoes refuse To ever grow weary I keep cheerful On an earful of music, sweet 'Cause I've got those Hap, happy feet Happy feet, We've got those happy feet Give them a low down beat And they begin dancing I've got those Ten little tapping toes And when they hear a tune I can't control my dancing heels To save my soul Traurigkeit qu?lt mich nicht lange Zeit Gar nicht mehr Schmerz und Leid. sobald wir tanzen... I keep cheerful, on an earful... ...of music... sweet! 'coz we've got those Hap, hap, happy feet! Well done, girls! Bravo! Splendid! - Thank you, Mr. Irwin. - You're welcome. Say, Charlie, what's the big idea? Don't you think I'm entitled to a little consideration? What for, Paul? After all that's said and done. It's dancing that puts a number over. All you do is stand back there, wave a little stick... ...and form a background. And what a background! How do you know that I can't dance? You don't mean to tell me that you're well-versed... ...in the intricacies of the art of terpsichore? No... but I can dance. Charlie, I've a secret confession... Ever since I've been a little fellow I've been able to dance oh quite well. Ever since I was about, oh about so high. Yeah, but how wide? You really want to dance? Alright. Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Paul Whiteman will now dance. So help me, Bob! Good evening, Charles. Won't you sit down? Thank you. Something I can do for you? Well, sir... I don't know how exactly to start... but you see... I love your daughter. And I know your daughter loves me. We want to be married. So I've come to get your consent. Love is a wonderful thing, Charles. But this is a practical world. And I feel that I have the right to ask you a question. Now, how about your financial status? Are you making money enough to support a wife? I'm making 65 dollars a week... That ought to be enough. There, my boy, you've hit the keynote of the entire situation. 65 a week is enough for 2. But it may be rather scanty fare for more than 2. And you know that... After you and my daughter are married... ...there may be some children. We made up our mind not to have any. But in spite of your intentions... ...there may be a baby. Well, we've been pretty lucky so far. Though you are a great big grown-up... You are like a child to me... And somehow or other you... ...make me want to mother you. Every now and then I'll own up... I want to take you on my knee... The hardest thing for me to do... is to keep my hands off you I live to fix your tie, smooth your hair... Put things in order, here and there... I'd like to do things for you. I'd like to pick the lint off your suit... Coz I want to keep you nice and cute... Coz I like to do things for you. There doesn't seem to be, need for me to mention... That I'm the party who can give you attention I'd like to tuck your shirt, straighten your hat poke all around you, just like that... I'd like to do things for you. Hardest thing for me to do... ...is to keep my hands off you! I get an awe-full kick, simply by... ...taking a cinder from your eye... I like to do things for you I like to mend your things, darn your clothes... clean your ears, blow your nose... I like to do things for you I must, by hook or crook... make you look real snappy... If there's a chance to do, things for you I'm happy. Tear buttons off, now and then... So I can sew them on again... -For evermore I like to do things for you! I like to touch your hair, hold your hand... Play with your fingers, because you understand... I like to do things for you. I like to cuddle up close to you... ...be momma's baby kitchy-coo! Coz I like to do things for you If anything I do... pleases you... don't thank me When I'm bad place me on your knee and spank me. If you'd like to hold me on your lap... You just go to it Momma... I'm no sap! I like to do things for you. There doesn't seem to be a need for me to mention, That you're the party who can give us attention, I'd tear your buttons off now and then so I can sew them on again Coz I like to do things for you. There doesn't seem to be need for me to mention that I'm the party who can give you attention I like to pull your shirt... douse your hat You're acting all pretty ...like a pussy cat Coz I like to do things for you! On the scene so gay From all the merry throng he stood apart. A kindly-faced policeman, whistling "Broadway Melody"... Observed the teardrops in the laddys' eye. "Don't bring a frown to Broadway", in a gentle tone, said he... "With trembling voice," the youth began to cry. Has anybody seen our Nellie? She's somewhere on the great white way...
