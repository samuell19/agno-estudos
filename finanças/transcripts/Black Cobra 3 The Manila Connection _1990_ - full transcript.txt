[soft instrumental music] [birds chirping] [electricity buzzing] [electricity sputtering] [device beeping] [footsteps pattering] - You. [gasping] Don't move, don't move. [man grunting] [man groaning] [birds chirping] - [groaning] Damn. - Hurry up with that! Move! [siren blaring loudly] [glass shattering] [gun firing] [men groaning] [energetic action music] [guns firing] - After him! There he is! [guns firing] [electricity rattling] [men groaning] [guns firing] [gun firing] Come on. [suspenseful music] [guns firing] [men groaning] [water splashing] [explosion blasting] [men groaning] [water splashing] [man yelping] [man grunting] [waterfall raging] [guns firing] [guns firing] - I got him! [guns firing] - He's out of range. Let's get back to base. [man sighing] [soft music] [doorbell ringing] [doorbell ringing] - Who is it? - It's me, Charlie. Open up, Sioni. - Hello, darling. Charlie, what happened to you? [groaning] Oh Charlie, for God's sake, what happened to you? [Charlie breathing heavily] [suspenseful music] [door clicking] - Morning, gorgeous. - Good morning, Greg. - So how you doin' today? - Just fine. - Good. Is the boss in a good mood this morning? - Yeah, he's already in there waiting for you. - [sighing] Well, let's get it over with, huh? - [chuckling] Okay. - Ah, here is he. Lieutenant Gregory Duncan, I'd like you to meet Mr. Lawrence Brennan of the State Department, and Mr. Jackson of the CIA. Greg here's the agent I've been telling you about. - Captain Felix has spoken very highly of you. - Well, the boss has a tendency to exaggerate just a little bit. - Have a seat. - As you probably know, Charlie Hoskins was recently found dead in a local river. His body was riddled with bullets. Unfortunately, he was stripped of any identification or whatever papers he might have been carrying. - Yeah, I was sorry to hear about that. Unfortunately, I didn't get to know the man very well, he wasn't here very long. - Well Agent Hoskins was working on a very sensitive case for the government. He had evidently come up with some pretty hard information. They killed him before he could pass any of it back to us. - The CIA has an undercover program in which we are supplying military aid to various revolutionary groups fighting for democracy all over the world. Unfortunately, one of these shipments, it includes 20 land missiles and other conventional weapons has disappeared. Shortly before it was scheduled to leave one of our bases here in the Philippines. - You suspect anyone in particular? - No, but five days ago the State Department received an ultimatum from an unknown group, which claims to have the supplies. Either the government deposits $50 million in a numbered account in a Swiss bank within 20 days, or the well-documented news goes to the world press. - Such a scandal would jeopardize not only East, West relations, but also the Geneva's start negotiations on this armament and reductions of strategic nuclear weapons. - I think you get the idea, Lieutenant. In short, it's absolutely imperative that you find out where these weapons are being kept, and that you destroy them, together with all documentation. We have 15 days left in which to do so. - 15 days? - This is a full report from what we know on the case so far. Study it well. - Unfortunately, we can't officially back you up at any time, so. - No, I understand it completely, sir. - A CIA agent, an expert on computers and modern warfare will be assigned to you. - And should you need another collaborator, you must choose someone from the people you trust outside Interpol. [paper rustling] - I have just the man in mind. - This is WXKB in Chicago, continuing our show of sound. [woman laughing] - What's the word? - More- - Don't talk about it, just go get it! You, come on. ♪ Love, love, love ♪ This is the power of love ♪ Love, love, love ♪ This is the power of love - Woo! [man yells] - You wanna meet the Musketeer? [men laughing] The fuck do you think you're doin'? - Playing. - Playing? Come on man, let's go grab some beer. Don't fuck around. - Okay. ♪ This is the power of love ♪ Love, love, love ♪ This is the power of love ♪ Love, love, love - This is what we're looking for. - That's what you're looking for, no- - Hey, grab it. - Forget that shit and start filling the basket. [glass clinking] Get all of them. - Yeah, get all of them. [glass clinking] - Everybody, this is a holdup. [gun clicking] Nobody move. Hands up! The first one that moves is dead. And that means you, big guy! You think you can play smart ass with me, you're making a big fucking mistake! - I think you are the one that's making a mistake, pal. She's already called the cops. They're on their way here right now. - Cops? How the fuck is she gonna do that? - There's a button under the counter on the floor. - There is no button under that counter! - Your problem, not mine. Check it out. - Shit. [counter creaking] [woman yells] [gun firing] [gun clicking] [gun firing] [woman yelps] [man breathing heavily] [gun firing] [gun firing] [gun firing] [man groaning] [gun firing] - Billy! - Billy! [sobbing] You son of a bitch! Here I come, you bastard! I'm gonna splatter your brains all over this place! [suspenseful music] [gun firing] [man groaning] [sirens blaring] [person breathing heavily] [man grunting] - May I have the gun, sir? - Sure, it's all yours. - All right, get up, punk. Get up! Let's go. [soft music] [door creaking] [paper rustling] - Bob, I doubt if you recognize the voice but I'm sure you'll recognize the name. Duncan. Greg Duncan. That's right, Harry's little boy is all grown up. Seems like only yesterday that you and dad were sitting around the table, exchanging war stories. God, it's hard to believe it's been almost 25 years now. Three years ago, I was assigned to Interpol and just recently was brought in on a very delicate, top secret case, the details of which I can't go into on this tape. All I can say is, that the case has taken some very dangerous turns, and I'm about out of leads. I hate to use my father's relationship with you to persuade you, but I remember him saying over and over again, "If you ever need help, son, don't be afraid to call on Bob Malone." - Goddamn head, Malone! You ain't gettin' a days vacation out of me. What the fuck do you think this is, anyway? Bein' a cop ain't no part-time summer job. - Come on, Murton. I wouldn't ask for it if I didn't have a good reason. - I don't give a damn about your reasons! You listen to me, Malone. In this district, I'm the boss! I'm the one who will decide what's coming to you and what ain't coming to you. So bear with it, 'cause you ain't getting no kinda leave from me. Not now, nor in the near future. [phone ringing] How many times do I have to tell you that I don't want to be disturbed? What? Who the hell is this, anyway? Oh, uh, Governor. Excuse me, sir, uh... I was talking on my other line, sir, I didn't know it was you. Well, he's sitting right here in front of me now, sir. Certainly sir, you can consider it already done. I'm always at your service, Governor. Thank you, sir. You have a nice day too, sir. It was the governor. - Really? - You are expected over at the mayor's office on the double. There's a couple guys there from the CIA, wanna have a talk with you. So starting this moment, you are on vacation for an indefinite period of time. - [laughs] Hey well, thanks, boss. 'Cause I thought you said that, uh- - Damn you, Malone. Get off my back, and get the hell out of my office. Now! - Okay, okay, boss. Okay. I always knew you were a nice guy. [uptempo jazzy music] [engine whirling] [door thudding] You have a reservation for a Robert Malone? - Just a second. Oh yes, Mr. Malone, your room is ready. [paper rustling] - Could I have my key? And would you have someone take these to my room. - What number? - 1501. Oh, excuse me. - No problem. - Sir, your room number is 1503. The bellboy will bring your luggage as soon as possible. Have a nice day. - Don't forget to send her bags up. [key jingling] - Excuse me. - Yes? - Would you hold it just for a second? - May I help you? - Yes, um... I've got a problem with the bedroom curtain in my room. - Yes. - It won't stay on the rod. It needs larger rings, about this big. And I was wondering, could you be so kind as to send someone up to have a look at it? It would really be a- - See you around, baby cakes. - Hey! - So, I see you still got Baby, huh? - Who the hell are you? How come you know about Baby? - Grew up hearing about that thing. - Duncan? Greg Duncan, James's son. God damn, man, how the hell are ya? - I'm doing great. - Hey, I'm sorry I didn't recognize you. - That's okay, I mean, why would you? The last time you saw me, I was still hugging my teddy bear. There's someone in here you should meet. - Oh, yeah, yeah, right, this clown from the CIA. [Duncan clearing throat] - This clown happens to be standing right in front of you. Bob Malone, Tracy Rodgers. - Clown? - Nice to see you again. - Well, the pleasure's all yours. - Hey, hey. Timeout. You two have already met? - You might say that. Let's talk about business. I was briefed on the essentials in Chicago, and there's one thing I don't understand yet. Why didn't Hoskins notify you about his discovering? - Well, I wasn't assigned to the case at the time. But now, that doesn't mean that he didn't try and contact Interpol. - Greg, he must have left something behind. Did you check his place? - I sure did. I didn't find anything. But the two of you are more than welcome to search it again. - This is it, you have the honor. [keys jingling] Okay, any time. [lock clicking] - That's quite and impressive weapon there, you're sure you know how to use it? - You bet your ass I do. - [laughs] Hope I'll never have to. [door creaking] [suspenseful music] [curtain rattling] [drawers banging] - Find something? - Nah, just the usual tourist junk. - Hey Malone, look what I found. - What is that? - A miniature fan with the name of a nightclub on it. - Could mean something. - Well one thing it means is that he spent a lot of time there. - Fan Club. Any girls? [uptempo music] [woman laughing] - This place isn't half bad. Only I can't see what Hoskins found in it. - What are you saying? You don't think Hoskins liked girls? - Not as much as you, I bet. - Hey, look, I've got a great idea, okay? Since we gotta work together, let's try to be friends. Let's start by calling each other by out first names. My name is Bob. - Mine isn't. Besides, what's in a name? - If you wanna be a tough broad, it's okay by me. Bartender, what's the tab? - Two Moonlights, $15. - Here, $20, give me some information on this man. - Sorry, never saw him before. - Looking for somebody? Can I see? Oh, I thought maybe it was my picture and you were looking for me. Pity. No. I don't know this man. - Why don't you just hang onto the picture, my phone number's on the back. Call me, if you remember anything. - Come back soon. Alone. - You should have asked her more questions, I think she's hiding something. - Not much from where I was standing. - What did they want? - They were asking about Charlie. - And what'd you tell them? - Guess. - Got a light? Don't look around, in case we've got company. - Taxi, sir? Ready. Okay, get in, and don't try anything. I said get in. [suspenseful music] [man groaning] [object thudding] [man groaning] [men grunting] - I'll tell you guys what. Who sent you? Who sent you? - No! - Malone! - Shit. [hand slapping] Tried to get some information. - Damn. [liquid trickling] - Yeah, I almost got some information out of one of those clowns. - Hey, forget about it. What do you say we get a little sleep, huh? See you in the morning for breakfast? - Okay, goodnight. - Goodnight, Tracy. - See you later, partner. - All right, bud. - Tomorrow's another day. - You got it. ♪ Every time you watch ♪ Every time you smile ♪ This is the power of love - What the hell do you think you're doing? ♪ Every time you go - My room, looks like the connecting doors are broken. - Well, thanks for the information. Now would you leave? - No problem. - Hey, Melone. The key? - There is no key, I told you the doors are broken. - Well, I'm not taking any chances. ♪ This is the power of love - See this? This gadget can detect any presence at the door. - Wonderful. Now I don't have to worry about you coming to my room, have a good sleep. - You really should eat, these pancakes are delicious. - No thanks. - Lost my appetite. - You two are getting along great this morning. - So if you guys will excuse me, I have to go to the airport. I had the CIA send me something that will come in handy on the job. - Really? We're leaving, too. We're going to the port. Got a tip about a witness who saw what happened on the night of the robbery. You sure? [soft uptempo music] [horn sounding] [engine rumbling] [doors thudding] [horn sounding] Lieutenant Duncan, Interpol. We understand you may have witnessed a robbery here the other night. - Yeah, that's right. It was nine nights ago. It was a German ship, they were unloading wooden crates. They were not stevedores, for sure. As far as I'm concerned, they were thieves. They put the cargo in a handcart, took them all away. - Did you happen to see where they took them? - Of course. It surprised me, they made straight for it. They took them into the old warehouse. - Where is this warehouse? - Right there. - Thanks, man. - Hey, how you doing today? We're from Industrial Accident Insurance. We came to check out your security conditions. - You got authorization? - Look pal, this is just a fast, routine checkup, okay? But if you insist, I'll come back here with a search warrant and do a thorough job. So thorough you better hope you're wearing underwear. - And I know you don't want us to do that, do you buddy? - Okay. Go right ahead. Look anywhere you like. I'll show you around. - This guy Forrest must own half of Manila. - Sir Malcolm Forrest. Used to be the British ambassador to the Philippines, now he's one of the richest men in the country. So, what kind of merchandise do you handle here? - Oh, wood pulp, farm machinery, just about everything. Mostly canned food, though. - This would be a little hard to digest, wouldn't it? - Get them! Get them! [energetic action music] [fists thudding] [men groaning] - Talk to me, fat ass! You're not too talkative, huh? - Oh, I'll make him talk. - Take it easy, take it easy! - Don't shoot me! I'll tell you what you want to know. Anything, everything! [gun fires] - No, no it's Jackson. He's with the CIA. - You didn't have to do that. He was about to tell us something. - He was about to shoot you. - Thanks. - So how'd you know we were here? - I got a tip. [sirens wailing] - You better handle it from here. I'm on vacation, remember? - Right. - Hi guys. Here, complements of the CIA. - No thanks, brought my own. [phone ringing] - Yeah, Greg Duncan? Yeah, he's here. Who's calling? A woman named Sione Alverez. You know her? - No, I'll take it. Robert Malone, here. - Are you the man from the Fan Club last night, asking about Charlie Huskins? - Yeah. - Well, I've got something here you might be interested in. Some pictures and some papers with top secret on them. - Yeah, how'd you get those? - Charlie left them behind in one of his jackets. Anyway, you interested or not? - Yeah, I'm interested. Where are they? - Hey, wait a minute. You don't think you're gonna have them free? - Never crossed my mind. How much do you want? - Well, I'm not hard to please. How about a thousand dollars? - Okay, payable upon delivery. - Now you're talking. I'll see you at Parko Park tonight at 2:15, after I get off work. I'll be behind the church, okay? - 2:15. See you there. - Top secret papers, and he left them behind just like that? - No agent would be that careless. - Unless he knew he had been discovered and couldn't get back to his apartment. - This girl mentioned Parko Park. Is that some kind of amusement park? - It's not that amusing. [suspenseful music] - Some kind of amusement park this is. It's a god damned cemetery. - Actually, it's a 16th century Spanish shrine. - No shit? - No shit. Parko Park's a big place. Where the hell is she? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's check behind the building. [soft tense music] [gate creaking] Check that way. Greg. - Yeah? Got something? - Looks like she's been strangled. - Yeah. I'd say we got here too late, huh? - Yeah, for her and the papers. I don't see them around anywhere. - Maybe she was smarter than we thought. Maybe she left them behind. Drivers license says Quezon City, I think we should check it out. - Let's do it. [suspenseful music] Let's check in here, there's a small light on. - I'd say we're not the first ones here. - Don't move. - Drop your gun. - The invincible taxi driver. Nice to see you again. - Go. [fists thudding] [men groaning] [tableware clattering] - God damn taxi driver. - Hey, forget about it. That's not what we're here for. - I don't think they found what they were looking for. - Let me ask you something. Who knew, huh? Who knew about the meeting in the park? - So what are you trying to say? - Think about it Bob! Who knew? You, me and who else? - Come on. Don't tell me you're suspicious of Tracy? Hey man, this chick Sione tried to hold us up for a grand. How do you know she's not making a deal with somebody else and upping the price? - Just a possibility. - Well, screw the possibility! - A little lenient with the CIA, aren't ya? - That's not the point. It's a little soon to be distrusting Tracy, okay? - It's your call. [suspenseful music] - Greg? - Yeah, what you got? Looks like we hit pay dirt. - Yeah, let's hope so. [suspenseful music] [machine beeping] - The problem is, it's impossible to tell which jungle this is. I mean the only reference point that we have is a waterfall? I mean, there are literally hundreds of waterfalls in Luzon alone, and that's not even talking about Mindanao and Cebu. - Look at this ugly thing Hoskins drew. - What is that? - Hey, hold on a second. I've seen something like that before. That it? - It's the same idol. - Where'd you get that? - Found it in Hoskins apartment. - Coincidence? Well, it doesn't mean anything. You know, I know an antique dealer who sells these things, and I'll bet you we can get some information from him. He's got this little shop, right, in the Pistang Market. - Where's that? - It's just outside the center of town. It's like a little bazaar, where you can get anything you need. - All right, let's run with it. [soft music] [man laughing] All right, where to now? - I'm pretty sure it's down there on the left. [bell jingling] - Good morning, gentlemen. - Hello, my friend. - Welcome to my humble shop. What can I do for you? - Actually we just want some information, which we're willing to pay for, of course. - What sort of information? - You tell us about this? - This is a very old, primitive ivory. A divinity of the Moral Tribe, who were the first inhabitants of this island. Unfortunately, it is just a copy, it has no value at all. - That's not really important, see what we want to know is, does it have any geographical significance? - Can you connect this thing to any specific part of the country? - Well, the main journey would be in the track of land, at the foot of Lanick Mountain, Northeast of Manila. - Thank you. - Greg, Greg, hold on. Check out these birds. - What are you, a collector of fine art? - No, we got a couple of uglys following us. - May I help you, sir? - Yes, how much is this? - $1. Thank you. [soft tense music] [man groaning] [fists thudding] [men groaning] - Shit. Hope that's all them. - How's the little birdie? - Perfect. [laughs] She made it through. [suspenseful music] - Easy, Mr. Malone. Every time I meet you I wind up looking down thee barrel of your gun. - Seems like you always show up when least expected. - My compliments, you're right on the job. - Sorry, we weren't expecting any visitors. - Just wanted to check if the equipment we sent you is adequate, and see if you learned anything. Well, have you got any news? - Well actually- - Well actually, we do have few leads we're checking on. - It's just that our time is running out, gentlemen. Well, I'm sorry to have disturbed you. I'll let you two go back to work. Good luck, Duncan. - Appreciate that. - Mr. Malone. - Mm. [elevator bell dinging] [suspenseful music] - Ah, that's the waterfall. - Yeah, right, here's the river. Looks like Hoskins left some kind of trail behind him in this area, but that's nothing but a god damn jungle! - I know, but look. It's completely surrounded by mountains, that's a perfect hiding place. Where's that- - Look at this. Those buildings? I'll bet you anything those are sugar mill storage houses. You know what I'm thinking? Sir Malcolm Forrest. - Yeah, could be. Anyway, whatever he stole is hidden someplace in that area. - Well I say, first thing in the morning, we're in that jungle. You know, if Hoskins could manage to get here, I think we can. - Yeah, but remember. He didn't get out. - Well, that's one little detail I'd like to try and avoid. What did I do with my jacket? - What do I look like, your valet? I don't know, maybe you left it in the other room somewhere. - You're right, man. [machine whirring] [machine beeping] [keys clacking] [suspenseful music] Dammit! Bob, stop whatever you're doing and come with me. - Jesus, what the hell? It's like you just saw a god damn ghost. Hi, Tracy. [drawers banging] - Looking for something? - I would love to know what you were doing with this? - What does one usually do with a modem? Transmit things, maybe? - Really, to whom? - Oh, the KGV, the Chinese secret service. Take your pick? - Hey, don't get cute with me! - Who's being cute? I was making my usual nightly reports. - What's in these reports? - Not much, unfortunately. Now, is this interrogation over? - Yeah, yeah. Come on guys. Aren't we just a little uptight, okay? - Fine. Sorry. Just forget the whole thing. I just think it's a little bit strange that we keep getting these constant attacks at every critical moment. Bob, somebody knows every move we're making. - No one can intercept my messages, they're all in code. - Maybe there's a spy in home office. Wouldn't be the first time. - All right do me a favor. Just suspend the reports for now. Maybe we can avoid these little surprises, huh? - Okay, if that's what you want, we can try it. [suspenseful music] [engine roaring] [birds chirping] - Look, about last night, I'm... I'm really sorry about everything I said. - I've already forgotten about it. - Thanks. - We're gonna have to walk from here. Let's load up. [suspenseful music] [water raging] - This waterfall is the same one that's on Hoskins' photograph. - I don't see how the hell we're gonna get up there. - There's gotta be another way. - Easy for you to say. There's got to be at least 50 miles of mountains, we sure as hell can't cover it all. - Yeah, but Hoskins came in this direction. There must be another way! - Then let's go find it before it gets too late. - Let's do it. - Try that way. [soft music] [birds chirping] [water splashing] Our way out is up. - Let's get it done. - Let's do it. [all grunting] [electricity buzzing] No sign we've been detected yet. - The problem now is, how do we get inside? The fence is probably wired with a lot of alarms. - Let me have the binoculars, Bob. - Bob? We're on a first name basis now? - I have an idea. Be ready to jump the fence when I say so. I'll cut the current for a few seconds. Hurry, the dart's already melting! [suspenseful music] [fence creaking] [voltage whirring] [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] - Cover me. [tense music] [knife swooshing] [man groaning] - Communication center. Time for you to go work, baby. [suspenseful music] [men grunting] Hope you're successful in breaking the access code. - Yeah, I hope so too. - Take care. - Mm. [suspenseful music] [light tense music] [papers rustling] [footsteps pattering] [suspenseful music] [machine beeping] - Let's get this over with. - Yes. - Flap three, down there. [machine beeping] [machine whirring] [man grunting] [man breathing heavily] - Let's check the building for the weapons. [suspenseful music] [door creaking] Shit, there's no weapons in here - Let's try the other room. - All right. [man grunting] [object thumping] [keys clacking] [computer beeping] - [exhales] One down. [man groaning] - Where are the weapons? - I don't know! - Where are the weapons? - I don't know! [groaning] Believe me! [fist thudding] [man groaning] [body thudding] [man groaning] [light tense music] - We got to find those god damn weapons. - You know, those wells look pretty strange. I saw four or five of those when we came in. - Yeah, I thought that was pretty strange too. - Okay, go ahead. [tense music] - After you. - Thanks a lot. [suspenseful music] [footsteps pattering] [computer beeping] [keys clacking] Bingo! US Army, let me see what you got in that bag. You happen to have any experience with plastics? - It's like riding a bicycle, my man. Once you do it, you never forget. [keys dialing] Son of a bitch. That damn thing is even cold. - Well that was nice of them to keep it on ice for us, wasn't it? [machine whirring] - Huh, what? Hey! [keys beeping] - Freeze, you bastard! [gun fires] [man groans] [gun fires] [man groans] [siren wailing] - Sounds like they heard us. Let's get the hell out of here! - I heart shots in the cavern! Go, hurry! - I was able to only get 10 minutes on this god damn thing. - What do you think our chances are? - Depends on how fast you are. - I'm right behind you. [men yelling] [computer beeping] - Look in here, [man yelling] - They're coming out, careful! Watch out! [explosion booming] [gun firing] [guns firing] [explosion booming] [man groaning] [guns firing] [man groaning] [guns firing] [guns firing] [men groaning] - It's been a pleasure. [guns firing] [electricity sparking] [guns firing] [man groaning] [guns firing] [man groaning] [guns firing] - Two minutes left, let's book. [guns firing] [man groaning] [guns firing] Look, we've got to find Tracy. [gun firing] Cover me. [guns firing] [guns firing] Come on, baby. Come on, baby. [engine whirling] [guns firing] [explosion booming] [man groaning] Come on, baby. [guns firing] [men groaning] [guns firing] [men groaning] [propellers whirling] [guns firing] [men groaning] [guns firing] - Tracy! Come on Tracy, hurry up! [guns firing] Come on, come on! [propeller whirling] [explosions booming] [men groaning] [explosions booming] [explosions booming] [explosions booming] [propellers whirring] Hey, you sure you know how to fly this thing? - A little late to ask that question, isn't it? You guys all right? - Yeah, couldn't be better. - Just before the alarm went off, I managed to severe the only other terminal the computer was connected to. - Yeah? Where is it? - At the summer residence of Sir Malcolm Forrest. - What a surprise. Bob, I know right where that is. - Point the way! [engine roaring] [propellers whirling] [slow suspenseful music] [birds chirping] Greg! [guns firing] [man groaning] [gun firing] [gun firing] [men groaning] [guns firing] [man groaning] [gun firing] [men groaning] - I see you found your way into my home, you presumptuous meddling fools. Put the gun away, there's no danger here. You barge into my home, you destroy a multimillion pound industrial complex, you start a war that killed many men and placed your own lives in danger, all for nothing. Absolutely nothing. - I wouldn't say that, buddy. Your blackmail scheme is over. - But I still have the incriminating documents. They were transferred here when the ray was tapered with. And they're being transmitted throughout the world at this instant. So I'm afraid you're too late. - Take a look at the screen, Sir Malcolm. [computer beeping] - What the bloody hell is this? - That's very serious news, I'm sure the world will be totally shocked. - Very nice work, Lieutenant Rogers. - Sir. - That goes for you two gentleman as well. The CIA is greatly indebted to you. We'll take care of Sir Malcolm. Now that he's been rendered harmless. - You're full of surprises. How did you know we were here this time? - Oh, we deduced that from Tracy's last report. Then our radar screen picked you up leaving the jungle, and followed you to where you landed. Well, thanks to you, the CIA can now consider this mission closed. - Something doesn't add up here. What last report? How did he get here? Greg, did you hear a helicopter land? [suspenseful music] [gun firing] [gun firing] You're not worth it. Mole came outta the hole. I can say, my man. Tracy was innocent. - Guess it was your call. [light action music] - Lieutenant Hanson, sir. I'll take over. You three in there. - They missed all the fun. - Bob, I was thinking. Maybe next time we could work together in Chicago. - Next time?
