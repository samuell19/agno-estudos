Eggs are available easily. Eat eggs you get strength and hatch it, you get chicks. But eggs get bad name because of eggs. Male is called as man and female is called as woman, But a eunuch is called as .5! Greens and vegetables are called as vegetarian, mutton, fishes are called as non-vegetarian. But egg is called as .5! Reason is like Sachin didn't get awarded with Bharat Ratna till he hit 100 centuries, a man who never ate egg is life gave an award to egg that it is most powerful vegetarian. Using his name many consider it as vegetarian and eating eggs. But few people avoid eating eggs calling it as non-vegetarian. So, egg was left without any decision. Taking the same as an example, if you give it to a boy, l don't know if it is right or wrong, he'll make an omelette of egg and eat it. lf you give the same to a girl... Shall l make omelette or fried rice? Shall l apply yellow to face and white to hair? Shall l hatch it or throw it some boy's face to fool him? She'll throw the egg on ground with such ideas. Eggs becomes omelette only if it is broken or become chick only if it hatches. But throwing like this would make it go waste. Let's begin our story with body of Goraju who got cheated by a girl in the name of love. Tell me. Where are you? - l told you, right? My friend is dead. l'll get late. Tell father about this. Cremation would be over by 6 pm, right But it's my best friend who died! Shouldn't l at least have 2 pegs? He's Sai, Suresh's best friend. Don't feel sad. Girls are like this, uncle. They use beautiful flowers and dot but their hearts not that beautiful. But if they find a good boy like him, they don't rest till they kill him. Look at them! They're angry for commenting on girls than sad about brother's death. They're great cheats! Don't worry, leave it. - Leave me, uncle. We got sense with this incident. We swear on the dead body of our friend. From today we'll not go after girls. We'll not send requests for new girls. We'll not hit likes for new posts. We'll marry the girl our parents select for us. We'll consider their happiness as ours. We'll never ever go after any girl. Ogling at girls, it's no more in our chapter. Not even in twitter. Lord Rama is ultimate truth! lf the girl is like a Goddess, won't every boy become a priest? Won't festivals like Dussera, Diwali and Sankranthi come at a time? lt seems every word is like a bullet fired from gun... lt seems every smile is like ring of temple bell... Why do we need cool breeze when their sari end breezes past us? lt seems their beauty is like getting possessed by Goddess Mother... lt seems their kiss shattering like earth quake... lf we've a woman as companion, why do we need this world? Girl came into the dream... Girl came to the temple... Girl came into our lap... Heart is open like switching on Bluetooth on seeing a girl... New feelings take over us... Like GPS is activated, we follow you as destination... We cross districts... They're the screensavers in both eyes... They're the wallpaper in our little hearts... Without your beautiful faces, everything is dull and bland... Girls have features which even ice creams can't boast of.. They create chaos in our minds... Girls lips are more intoxicating than liquor... They entice you to bite it... Their eyes are twin cameras... They flash at us constantly... We'll do anything for girls... What's this? 3Just now you swore, you talked about mother and father... You said you don't know who girls are! You're going after girls with dead body. Mustn't go after girls but if you see such a girl, don't leave her. Angel...she's an angel, uncle. Face is divine, uncle. lf l leave l may not get her again. What's this talk about love with corpse and in burial ground? Uncle, mausoleum is the symbol of love. Taj Mahal! For the present, this is our hero's Taj Mahal. House number and members of this house have a close relationship. All members in this house are number one. For all the members to be number and door number also to be one, the man behind this is city planning commissioner Sarvesh Anand Rao. Head of this family and a fan of joint family. Did you see? She's Anand Rao's wife Amaravathi. Giving birth to three lovely children, following husband's orders in letter and spirit, a chaste housewife who doesn't even watch TV soaps. lf day has to be good after coffee, Anand Rao believes it needs good planning. When he had a son after a year of marriage, he named him as Sudhir, planned in which school he must study from LKG to tenth class, and in which college he must study from inter to MBA, must work in which bank and where to find his bride, if they have a son, he must be named as Pravin, he planned this before and did as he had planned. Two years after marriage, Santhosh was born as Anand Rao's second son, as planned he made him a doctor and got him married too, if they have a boy or girl, he has a name for them also, he's awaiting for it to happen. After 3 years of marriage, Amaravathi gave birth to a beautiful daughter and presented her to Anand Rao. Considering her as Goddess Lakshmi herself, he named as her Lakshmi Anand, he planned that she'll become an engineer, raising her well and giving her good education, he made her a software engineer, he planned her starting salary must be Rs.25000. But he rejected when Rs.10000 was offered. Rejected Rs.20000 also. He rejected when Rs.45000 was offered. l'm getting more salary, right? You're happy. right? Look dear, we must fight for the life we had decided. Only then our life will be in our hands. lf we change our decision for better offer, our path will take wrong turn, our life will go into other's hands. We can't choose how we should be born. But if decide how to grow and what to become, we'll surely be like that. Wait till you get what your aim was! Anand Rao settled Lakshmi's engagement with a software engineer boy. Sent them by promising to fix auspicious date for marriage in near future. You see, when family gets together, it's a temple. But when it is silent, it is library. Library brings to my memory, the first rule of Anand Rao to the family, any member of family has to sign in, out time and details in the register. Every one including guests and servants. Not just building bodies without fat or buying things without vat, it's perfect to lead a family. Running a well disciplined family, Anand Rao believes in it, so many people are saluting with respect, that's because how he leads his family. This is Lakshmi's office. She's Lakshmi's boss who pays her. All these people are Lakshmi's colleagues. But she's Lakshmi's best friend. Her name is Pavithra and she's from Sangamithra. Your would be on phone. Tell him l'm busy with work. Connect it to my desk. No, please... You'll talk to him now and we'll listen to it. Can you please wait for some time? l'll call you after reaching home. No, l want to talk to you now. Tell me. l like love marriage so much. Now that we're engaged, right? lt's not possible now, right? But l've an idea. Today is Valentine's day, right? How about meeting today? Ours too would become love marriage. l won't do anything without informing my dad. l can't meet you. Who told you not to inform your dad? Tell him and come. - No, dad is in Delhi. Phone is switched off. Are you mad? You've to spend rest of all your life with him. That's his first wish. lf you don't go, he'll have this feeling all his life. 1Are we meeting, Lakshmi? l'm not Lakshmi, l'm her friend Pavithra. Wait in Coffee Day in MBP colony. She'll come. Try to understand me. Won't you leave me? Go! What's this? Hero is searching Lakshmi deeper than Google and higher than eagle. But he didn't find her yet. Like an lndian fan watching with interest even if 60 runs have to be scored in one ball. He's watching with great hope in the city's last college. For his dream girl What's the problem? - Ran out of petrol. No petrol bunk nearby too. One minute. Enough! lt's overflowing! She's going away! What happened? - Ran out of petrol. lf you give donate everything, won't your bike go dry? How? Get it. Ride the bike. Hi madam....Hi sir! We belong to Jai Bajrang Dal. You both are lovers, right? His bike went dry and l'm taking him to the nearest petrol bunk. See, he's carrying a bottle in his mouth. Any carrying an empty bottle is going to petrol bunk, anyone carrying a basket ball is going to Olympics, we're not so foolish to believe all this crap. Give me sacred thread. - Take it. Why don't you talk to them? What's the proof that we're lovers? Tie the knot with him now. Prove that we're lovers, l'll marry him happily. Should we conduct a blood test now? - l think so. Okay, as you say. What's your name? - Lakshmi Anand. Boy...dear....what's your name? Tell me, dear? - Tell your name. He's asking you. Why are you pushing him? Society is like that, l'll ask him. Boy. . .dear...what's your name? What's your name, dear? Dear, give me that bouquet. lt means you both are not lovers. Just helpers. lf you've any garden, shove it on my ears. Even if it is heavy, l'll carry it. Tie the knot. Come...come dear... Tie...tie...tie... Tie it! Please trust me. No! Please, l beg you. - Why are you delaying it? Come uncle, at least you're here for my marriage. He said uncle, but l don't see anyone here. Brother, he's running away with sacred thread. Hey you, stop! - Run...run...catch him. Stop...stop...stop... Got tensed? l'm there, right? Are you Sathya? Are you Sathya? l mean my grandfather's grandfather's name was Sathyanarayanmurthy. My grandfather was named as Sathyanarayana without Murthy. l was named as Sathya without Narayana. That's why my name is Sathya. Sai, you left the bike with keys. What if anyone steals? My name is Sai Sathya... You've been slapping me all the day, stop it now. Either l've to slap you or slap myself. Time now is 10.45 pm, no petrol in the bike. No time to walk home, leave me now, please. You've a friend Veerasamy in some wine shop, call him. ls Veerasamy my brother-in-law to give money or liquor whenever l ask? Come quickly. - Tell me, Rambabu. l need liquor, wait, l'll be there in 20 minutes. l'm shutting the shop in 10 minutes. Police are creating too many problems. Will you be open for 10 minutes? He says he'll be open for 10 minutes only, how to reach the shop? We've our regular plan, right? Stop...stop...stop... What happened? - My friend Rambabu. He has fallen down, l need to take him to hospital. What happened? He hurt his brain long back but since life is more important, he's living dangerously, sir. Don't know why but he fell down. - Get him quickly. Boy, we found a scapegoat, manage properly. Slowly....carefully... Quick...please... Close the door properly. Careful...careful... Go quickly, shop may get closed. - Shop? We've to go to hospital, right? lt's open 24 hours, right? Hospital will be there but l fear medical shop next to it may close. We'll reach. Come quickly, police are here. lf you get late, l'll close the shop. Don't do it, we'll be there in 2 minutes. Who is it? - Medical shop man. ls he threatening to close? - Yes, sir. Give the phone to me, l'll talk to him. Give me. We'll be there in 2 minutes, don't close the shop. Don't take it as business, take it as help. We'll be there in 2 minutes. Come quickly. l liked your dialogue that it's not business but help. Can l use it elsewhere, sir? This left...this left, sir. Here? - Here! Stop here, sir. Where's the hospital here? - Here only, sir. Where's the hospital here? You're a pain in neck! Craps! We're your regular customers, you've to bear it with us. Coming late? Aren't you ashamed to lie for lift to spoil your health? Government is bottling and selling it openly. We're drinking it to help govt. pay salaries to its employees. Why should we be ashamed off! Though l can't your face properly in darkness, l hate to see you. Though l can see you, l too hate to see you. Get lost! Go to hell! Why is he going away? - Uncle is hurt deeply. lf he had waited, he would've dropped us home. Had we asked, he would've run over the car on us. Take it. While pouring peg, don't be stingy. Karna of Mahabharata says we must be generous while giving others. Must be stingy while taking for ourselves. Remember that. - ls it? You make the drink. Then, do it. - Bloody philosophy and bloody you! Enough. We'll arrest for drinking outside the bar, you're having drinks in open place. Come to the station with me. People drink on main centre in Mexico. French drink near the factories. People drink near wine shops in Bangkok. But in lndia wherever one may drink, people ask, why are you drinking here? Won't you allow lndia to develop? Though what you say is nonsense, l like your concept. Developing lndia. l too wish to develop lndia. Yesterday morning a girl appeared and hit my heart. The same girl appeared today slapped and spat on my face. Because of this crook. - l got you a full bottle for it. What am l to do to impress her, Guru? lmpress makes me remember, when l was young... There used to be a girl in my street. Studying in the same institute. l tried a lot to impress her. She used to fight hard to pass the subjects she failed in inter. l was very speed like a horse. She was very slow like a tortoise. The tortoise girl tied to catch a rabbit once, but she couldn't. She left in despair. With an ulterior motive to impress her, l rang her door bell. She opened the door. l opened the bag and kept it in her hands. She gave a loud shriek and threw it away. She slapped and threw me out! Why? lt seems she wanted to raise the rabbit. l got it grilled thinking she'd like to eat. Reached my home! Why is it locked? Mother, l'm coming. What have you done, mom? Why are you climbing the gate? Gate is locked, right? - lt's open. Careful, son. Are you drunk? Couldn't avoid it. What's this, son? lf your dad knows, he'll rip our your skin. Can he bear the truth that his grown up son has come home drunk? ls dad in home? We both are very lucky, he hasn't come home yet. Okay, come and have dinner. l had. At least chew betel nut and go to bed. He'll sleep next to you. Betel nuts won't be in fridge. Are you drunk? Do you know how our son would be hurt if he knows you're drunk? Can that little boy bear the shock that his father is a drunkard? ls he in home? He came home at 7 pm, had food and went to bed. Then, l'll go to bed. - Food? You've to sleep next to him, chew betel nuts and go to bed. You're right! Betel nuts won't be there in fridge. Take it. Go to bed. l'm managing well, if not this house would become a hell. Come here. - Greetings, sir. Greetings, sir, Are you fine, sir? - Greetings, fine. Your daughter? - Yes, sir. Greetings, sir. - Greetings, dear. Pay for the vegetables. You said you're looking searching groom for her, any progress? We spent our lives with cap, l'm searching for a son-in-law with cap, sir. Even pen has a cap, marry her off to it. What else then? Don't worry about whether he's wearing cap or carrying laptop, check if he'll look after your daughter well or not. Coming...coming... Greetings, madam. Look how her hand is hurt. What happened? First apply ointment. - What happened? You asked that thrice, first give her first aid. How did you get hurt, dear? Leave her hand. lf you behave like this with family of police, what about others? l'll kill you... if l see you again in this area. Won't daughters of police get married or get husbands or go to honeymoon? What the hell are you blabbering? Come with me. How dare you hold my shirt collar! How dare you hold the collar of a police officer! Hands off me. Hands off me. Where are you going? To find whether your tailor stitched your shirt properly or the man who held it grew up well. Search for umbrella means rainy season is here. lf you go in search of trouble it means your bad days are near. His sins will take its toll, get the water heater l gave for repair. l must take bath and go to duty. Shop is closed. Call your father. Get down. Dad, shop is closed. He has kept it under the tarpaulin, pick it up from there. Hold on please. Dad, l got it. l'll check whether it is working properly or not. What's this it sounded like an iron rod? Recently when l had a leg fracture, doctor used iron rod, l used it. Bye, mom. You spent a lot on the bike, why don't you use it? No, mother. lt has proven unlucky to me. l'll catch a bus. l said it's like a widow, no need, but you didn't listen. Go, mom. O kohl eyed beauty... O moonbeam filled beauty... O beauty epitomized... O haiku in chic dress... l'm after you leaving everything else... Though what you did yesterday was wrong, l shouldn't have slapped you. l think my sorry has satisfied your ego. l don't have any ego problem. Everything is heart problem only. You slapped on right side but my left side is paining. Will you please check it? O my maiden, l love you... O my dear, l wish l may become you... My youth is seeking your companionship, don't refuse my dear.... l said sorry, right? Why are you still coming before me? lf l come after you may accuse me of chasing you. Whether you come before me or after me, l've understood your intention. Don't waste your time unnecessarily. My dad has already spent Rs.10 lakhs for my engagement. Rs.10 lakhs for engagement? Just say yes, l'll marry you without taking a rupee as dowry. lf you want l'll pay return dowry. l've told you l'm already half married. Had l not run away yesterday, we would've got married fully. Okay, can l try till you get married? Even if you try till 60th birthday, l don't think you can. Getting positive in first sitting is difficult, 2 or 3 sittings will give you clarity. When your fish like eyes move and look at me, my heart is swinging with happiness... lf you smile like fresh jasmine, l'll become a string of your apron... lf you create chaos in my dreams, how can l stop myself? When l see you l don't remember anything else... What have you done with me to go crazy? Listen to me, O dear... You stole my hidden heart... lf you say yes, l'll dance to your tunes... My heart beats for you is ringing bells of love for you... My heart is slipping away from me seeing your silken tresses... With mock angry face, you're tying me to your apron strings... You're locking me into life time commitment with your beauty as bait... O my ravishing beauty... O my angry bird... Come to me, O my beautiful queen... He's Software Subramanyam. He thinks he's father of software industry. Dominating mother-in-law and living with wife is his hobby. Subramanyam who is on this job 24 hours, a 24 year old boy became an hurdle to him. How angry he gets if someone disturbs him when he is in full flow, you'll know when you see Subramanyam. Who is disturbing at this hour? - Move l need to talk. Move, l need to talk. l need to talk to sister. - Sister? What do you want to talk with your sister? To know what Lakshmi's program tomorrow. Does your sister look like production manager to tell you the program? l've a doubt, do you love her or she? - Brother-in-law! What brother-in-law? Come with me.- Just a minute. l'll talk to my sister. Hubby! lf you come after my wife to help trap some girl, don't think l'll be soft because l'm software engineer. My hardware inside is intact, if l take it out, you're finished, get out. Get out! Go away! Why are you wearing gown? l beg you...come! l'll call you later, go. Why software Subramanyam claims he's hardware? He's software only. He said that for argument. You go to bed. Just for fun? Yes, sister-in-law! She's Subramanyam's mother-in-law, Sangamithra's mother, Gangamithra. Though there's a software engineer in every home like Nandi in every Shiva temple. Gangamithra who thinks even district collector is gully cricketer before software engineer, she addresses software son-in-law as brother Gates, brother Nadendla, uncle Premji and make a living! Poor woman! Please have little and go. Why are you going to office on Sunday also? Just because it's Sunday can l forget to wear brief? Brief and software both work on Sundays too. No, hubby... - Don't chew my brain. l'll get you brain by evening, make a dish with raw mangoes for dinner. Dear... - Hubby!- What? Your mother! Facebook still? What's the status? Subramanyam going to office for 660th time. Add software Subramanyam, oaky? Mother-in-law, recently when l had a bout of jaundice and video was uploaded, l didn't get much applause, l consider uploading jaundice video as silly, you're worried about applause, silly man! My post must have at least 1000 likes and 100 shares. Please maintain that. l don't mind failing CR but PR must be perfect. Okay Subramanyam. Don't forget to add Software Subramanyam. What's this Subramanyam? lf you cut mutton in my shop, customers will not buy from my shop. Why are you so late on Sunday also? l had to go through hell to get dressed up to become a butcher. lf you give me place, l'll carry on with my job. Move! Please step aside. You're a man, why do you need it? Go away. When bad times come, you choose bad! How many, madam? - Two. Have a blast! Oh God! Did he recognise me? You take over for two minutes, l'll come back. What's this? You came just now and leaving so early. Why are you doing video piracy? lt's illegal, give it to me. Not your balls but your head, to show it to your mother-in-law. You think l'm software Subramanyam, l'm mutton Mastan. l don't have beard there but l do have here. Everything else is same. Give this to me. Sir, your acting is too good. But Sulabh complex thing is too bad. You want to see? - Did you see everything? No, l captured everything in video. l beg you, l'm earning a living working as butcher, if you show this to my mother-in-law, wreaths would be laid for this video and my photo. Please give it to me, l beg you, man. Leave me, don't worry, brother-in-law. For the present you don't have any problem with it, it'll be safe with me. When would l get rid of this curse, lord? When world gets peace! - You mean? As soon as Nagalakshmi is married. Bloody hell, l'll never get rid of this curse. Loud mouth! l'll try, you help me. After the job is done, let's sit in Dasapalla hotel and delete it. Okay? lt's burning, check it. Grandma! Should we help or seek help? You must help those who seek. Then, will you please give me a glass of water? You! Mother, grandma has written a letter. Though there are phones, why still write letters? What's in it? My inquiries about everyone. Your mother and son-in-law were to come here to discuss about erecting temple mast. Tell them not to come now. Anandhi's mother died. Entire village is mourning. Priest Sharma's wife is also mourning. l'll intimate after the village comes out of this sorrow. Whether you can come or not. That's for now. Mother-in-law, if anyone dies in village, would entire village mourn it? Not in my village, you know TV serial 'Chinnari Pellikuthuru', right? ln that serial Anandhi character's mother is dead. That's their problem. Sister-in-law, brother's phone has come, l'm keeping it here.- Okay. Dad too got a letter... Though office hour is over, how come you're working so sincerely? Not working sincerely but thinking seriously. What happened? - You know about my family, right? Why not? Yours is perfect happy family, right? No jokes please, it's serious. Please tell me. There are no secrets between anyone in family. But today a secret has stumbled out. l couldn't believe it but it's true. - What's the secret? My dad has a lover. -Your dad? You mean you've a step mother? No, the love matter is before his marriage. Not present time. Yesterday my dad got a letter. By mistake l read the letter and got a big jolt. To know if the letter is true or not, l read my dad's diaries. l came to know the matter in the letter is true. Before marriage my dad had a lover. Unable to go against parents, dad sacrificed his love to marry my mother. But she wasn't like him. She left her family for love and living alone. l spent all these years with memories. Now she's having health problems and on the verge of death. She wants to meet my dad in her last days. l don't have anyone. l didn't realise all these years but l feel someone close should be near me. lf you come, l'll die happily thinking l've someone in this world. Waiting to meet you, yours Devika. lf your father reads this letter, would he to go to her? No! My dad doesn't know to change decisions or rethink what he had decided. He can change now, right? Till now dad has never changed his decision. He'll not go. He'll feel guilty if he knows l read this letter. This will become starting point of disturbance in my family. What's your idea now? l'm thinking of going myself to console her. Will you join me? What did you tell your family? First time l lied in the register about going to Bangalore on office work. What if your dad checks with office? - My dad will never do that. l'm my dad's trust not a liability. ls this the place? - Yes, this place only. Address? - ln letter. Where's the letter? - ln my bag. Where's the bag? ln bus! - Bus has left! Don't worry, bag is not in the bus but under his armpit. lt won't smell bad. - No problem. What are you doing here, Sai? Will you stop it? You gave him information and asking what are you doing here? Will you keep quiet? How would l know? What are you doing here? Who is this armpit guy? l'll tell, sister. Nobody should tell about me. l've written my autobiography, buy and read it. He's big thief in Rajahmundry, my father arrested him in a case, since he's not well, he has sent me to drop him in Rajahmundry station. By chance we boarded the same bus you were travelling. He was lifting your bag and l caught him. That's why we got down. This is the lousy story of this lousy thief. Stop it, sir. Like Lakshmi Ganapathy films 'Aadupuli' ad repeating hundreds of times. you're going on repeating that l'm thief. Do you know what did l steal, sister Pavithra? His father arrested me for stealing a safety pin, sister. Will you arrest for stealing a safety pin? lt's different matter that safety pin had 4 sovereigns of gold. Aren't you ashamed to rob others? How can it be good if money is stagnant in one place? Won't it affect lndian economy? Let's go, forget about them. Those who can't wage wars talk about justice. They belong to that group. Let's go. l'm here for her, let's go. - ls it? Look, they're following us. - l'll take care of them. Why are you following us? Not for you. lt seems there's something like that between him and her. Shut up and mind your work. Sister, we're coming thinking we could be of some help. We don't want any help. Bloody punched nose lady! Who will help you anyway? He thinks so. lf she needs any help, l'll do it. You can go. Will you help her? l'll make a phone call. Did you steal phone also? - lt's my duty. Do it, waiting for an hour. Where are you, brother-in-law? Where would l be? ln mutton shop. Tell me quickly, l'm busy. 40 kilos mutton, 10 kilos of mashed mutton, 3 heads, 6 brains, 4 legs. He has already given tokens, l'm dying to deliver it. Wait a minute. What do you want? Want leg piece? ls this okay? Get lost! Sister is doing too much. ls this new? She always does it. l don't know what she does or what you will do, sister must get back to home in next train in 5 minutes. lf not you know the consequence, right? - Are you blackmailing me? No, l'm sending MMS to aunty. That's what the trouble with you, tell me what should l do now? Tell her something, say health problem. Say pain in hand, leg or head or body. Tell anything you want. ls this your stomach pain? Just do what l say. - l'll do. lt's Subramanyam! Where are you? Do you know my condition now? Just one day, l'll be in home tomorrow morning. lf you come now, come to hospital, tomorrow come straight to cemetery. Do you think there will be instant reaction for phone calls? Why not? Look there. What about my situation now, Pavithra? l beg you, widow get up will not suit me. Anyway l can't lose my husband for your father. Sister! - Bus! Sister! - Bus is going away! Come...come... Stop...stop... Come, sister. Pavithra, stop! What about my plight? - Please leave me alone. Use him. - Use me. He? - He's my man, use him. Please use me once. Please use me at least once. Please use me. - lf you use once, one more time free. l can manage my work, you mind your work. Yes, father. l'll hand him over in station and come back, father. When temple bells ring, my heart rushes... What are you doing? l'm praying to God for your speedy recovery, Lakshmi. You're not ringing bell but sealing it. Keep it there. - You saw it. You stole my chain, cell, are you stealing bells too? Stop your nonsense and tell me where am l? You are where you should be. How do you know the address? Read the letter. You read only address, right? Thinking it won't be nice we read the complete letter. lt seems your father's love, she's your step mother. Do you've any sense? Not only had you read the letter but made him also read it. What are you saying? l'm illiterate, he read and l listened. Hold her hand, why watch like a fool? Shut you, you thief! Please listen to me. - Tell me, what's it? lf aunt asks who you are, what would you say? What did you tell her? - You mustn't scold him, okay? You wait. - Tell me. You mustn't beat him. l beg you! - Okay, go ahead. Will you tell me or not? l told her we're going to marry soon. Are you playing tricks? How could you say that? lf i tell you got engaged to another man but roaming with me for some work, it won't be nice, infact horrible, moreover this is village. They're very traditional, if you don't like it, l'll tell her the truth. May l? - Wait. lf you try to take advantage of the situation, be careful. l'll not...not... Whatever you did till now was too much, why is she saying like that? Her walk, gait and appearance is like her father. lsn't she like Anand, doctor? Stop! - Stopped. Did your father sent you or you came on your own? l came with my father's permission, aunty. That's why he sent my fianc to accompany me. She's a big cheat. Come. How do you feel now? Doctor, you can go now. Bye, madam. Sivudu, get a pumpkin, l must ward off evil eye cast on her. Me? Ward off evil eye? l feel shy, aunty. No need of that, aunty. Wait. You too join, sunny. Not you...you come. - You go. Divine like mellifluous music of flute... A young warrior... Was there any day as beautiful as today... l wish to take a new birth again... A birth that can make me mother... When is your birthday, aunty? Why? - Just asked casually. Don't know if l'll live till my birthday or not. You must tell. Good to eat fruits before sleep, have it. Yes, l too eat a coconut fruit every night before going to sleep. Coconut fruit? lt's like this, there are two halve and we offer it to God. lt's coconut not fruit. Do they call like that here? Anand won't fix his daughter's marriage with you unless everything is correct. Sai, if you've made him agree, it means you're Mr.Perfect. What do you do now? Left engineering midway because of too much entertainment. Since dad was feeling too much, l bargained and bought certificate for Rs.50000. l mustn't do any job with such certificate, right aunty? So, l sold grandpa's property. Lent it on 30/0 interest and living happily on it. After marriage? - She'll get salary, right? l'll enjoy it. What about after having children? - l'll live on my dad's pension. After children grow up? - They'll start earning, right? l'll enjoy it. l'm better than you, l'm working to eat. This fruit. Your house, this back yard is very beautiful. You live alone in this big house, don't you've anyone? l'm not alone, l've everyone. l'm not there for them. l think people who fall in love must sacrifice something. Her father sacrificed love to get closer to his family. l gave up my family to be with my love. Though l was living alone and my people were away from me, l didn't have any feeling, when l came to know l'm dying, the feeling that l'm alone is scaring me too much. God hasn't yet found medicines for my disease. God took away people from my life. No medicine is working, it's my damn fate. Let's talk tomorrow morning, you go to sleep. You don't have any manners. We're here to keep her happy. Not to hurt her. You don't have any manners. We're here to keep her happy. Not to hurt her. Eat orange. Enjoys, wants to enjoy everything. Why did you bring coffee? lf l hurt my mother, l do like to win her back. No need to say sorry. l've a small surprize for you, aunty. - Really? Give me the cup. Close your eyes, aunty. Come with me. Come l say! Open your eyes now. Your entire family, didn't recognise them? That's your elder brother. Yes. Their children. Your sister, brother-in-law and their daughter. This photo is recently taken in your younger brother's daughter's marriage. That's your nephew. All are well settled, aunty. You're great. They're not great. You! lt's 25 years since l saw them. lnfact l don't know many of them. How could you do it in one night? Last night you told your family surname, aunty. l searched Facebook, Orkut and twitter. l found every one of them. Come closer. l lied that medicines won't work on me. They didn't give the right medicine. Do you know what that medicine is? lt's you! When l see you l feel like happiness is draped in pant and shirt. Lakshmi, when you see me, do you feel happiness is draped in short and vest? Everything is okay but l couldn't get your father's photo, aunty. No need, my father is there. ls he your father? l thought it was Sri Krishna Devarayalu. What did you say? l'll get ready, let's go around the village. Come... You're very lucky to get Sai. He'll keep you happy all your life. l'll stand guaranty. l too said the same but she's not catching my point, aunty. Hey you...stop... - Come....run...run... My life wasn't really happy or tough. But when you both came here, it has become wonderful. Even if your father had come l wouldn't have been so happy. Next time l'll come with my dad, aunty. Look, though life is full of struggles, it's really great to die happily! When Sun rises, it's very beautiful, it's beautiful even when Sun sets! You and Sai brought that beauty and happiness to my house. lf l die this minute... Calm down, Lakshmi. l too feel like crying. Please don't cry. Though didn't have any relationship, l myself unable to control grief. And you... Lakshmi, you're engaged, have you forgotten it? ls moonbeam spilled from your smile? Are the colours of rainbow yours? ls your heart beat the rushing and gushing Godavari? When l'm alone... l hear your voice in the songs of cuckoos... l'm thrilled... l'm seeing your face in the moon... Are your smiles blooming as flowers in garden? ls the chime of your anklet turning into a poem set to tune? Prosperity and happiness follows your footsteps... My heart is flying with happiness... ls the gentle breeze breezing or your breathe.. My heart, body and soul is floating in a trance.. Are your feet rushing like flowing river to reach me? ls happiness hitting my heart like never ending sea waves? Our relationship will never break even in dream... Singing romantic duets... Has the mist of suspicion evaporated in the warmth of our friendship? Are love clouds showering gentle rain on us? Stop...stop...Lakshmi... She went away. That's not my problem, bus has left, right? Don't feel sad, let's catch an auto. Come. What should l do now? - l'll manage my father. You carry on with your job of stealing. - No, Sai. What will you do now? After seeing all this l too want to fall in love. Lakshmi, stop! Are you sending your body in parcel? You've packed yourself fully. Just for fun. Why did you leave me alone in village? l didn't leave you, l wanted to get rid of you. You're like bad habit, anyone would get addicted to it easily. l don't want to become an addict to a thing known as Sai. Why this sudden decision? What has happened now? What happened? We both meeting and talking to each other is not good for both of us. Stop, just a minute. Leave bad habit known as Sai, l'll not say no. But l helped you a lot in village though you didn't ask me. lsn't it? - l don't deny it. You must do me a small favour. For the help l did to you, if you help me, account will be settled. lf you say no, my credit limit will remain with you. Think. Okay, if l help you mustn't come after me again. You mustn't torture me. lnfact never again show up before me. lf you agree to these conditions, l'll do. As Sunday specials does your father bring hearts and livers? Yes, why? Nothing, you're an expert in cutting and eating my heart. lf you agree say yes or else l'm going away. Okay, l agree to your conditions. - By the way, what help should l do? Who is the witness? Sign it. l'm there for you, please. Thank God, marriage is over. Come, let's exchange garlands. - What? l mean let's help them exchange garlands. Where are the garlands? What's this? - Biryani. 3 chicken and 3 mutton biryanis. No prawns? - He said no stock. Won't you ever spare marriage and obsequies feast? Give garlands. - Garlands. Exchange. Claps! Father! ls your marriage over? l'm very happy. Are you all their friends? Aren't you both who got them married taking their parents' place? Aren't you Anand Rao's daughter? My daughter died last night after packing her bag. Good up there is watching this. l'm sure he'll watch! lf daughter runs away from home to marry, any father would feel sad, can you expect him to serve Bawarchi biryani? Come on, forget it. We didn't do anything wrong. They both are majors, they wanted to marry and we helped them. lf that is wrong, there won't be any registered marriage in registrar's office. Govt. should ban it. Anyway do you need TV ad for film not running in theatres. Why not think about our film which is about to release? Look, l'll never make my father to shed tears like him in registrar's office. Anyway you promised not to disturb me in life if l do this help. What's this again? - l'll sacrifice my life for love. ls promise greater than life? l broke it. To hell with my promises. Break it or go to hell with your promises. l don't give a damn about it. One last and final word. Remember it. lf my father asks me to marry a dog, l'll marry. He found a software engineer Sathya and told me to marry him, he got us engaged too. lf he tells me now that Sathya is not fit for you, Sai is very good boy, he loves you too, if he says marry him, l'll agree readily. So, stop chasing me and go after my father. You may succeed. Would she fall if you trap her father? lf you mix hot and dog, can you get hotdog? Forget her, Sai. Sai, l'm warning you, summer is coming. Beers are not available, even if we get they're charging Rs.20 over MRP. Listen to me, forget her. She's a standard 120 fire shot bomb! Some day she'll blow your heart in mid-air 120 times. How dare you compare my love with Diwali crackers! l'll kill you. l'm also telling you the same, she'll kill you some day. Shut up! You're not even the size of sample soap kept in hotels. Are you advising me? 1 l'll advice you. ln just one week. With a week l'll make her father flat. l'll charm her family, l'll come back after fixing my marriage with her. Dear...sunny... What happened there? You went there with full force, right? As Lakshmi told me, l tried every trick in trade to impress her father. Forget about impressing her father, l got an indelible black mark in society. Gay! l didn't know what to do these 7 days. When l was thinking deeply sitting in Seethammadhara bus stop on the last day... Did you call me, master? Not you, fool! l called my grandson Prasad. l'm also Prasad's grandson, my grandfather's name was Prasad. l'm blind and l'm new to this place. He promised to come in minutes and vanished. Moreover l'm feeling thirsty. Thirsty? Shop is very near, come, let's have few pegs. Hey you drunkard, l don't drink. You must drink, you foolish teetotaler! How dare you call me that! l'll call any man a fool who doesn't drink! How dare you call me fool! Bloody drunkard! Am l still alive? ls it you Prasad? Where the hell did you go away? Get me down, where did you go away? Your father named you after me, l gave my entire property to you, leaving me with a bloody drunkard, where the hell did you go away? Where did you go? Why don't you answer me? l helped him because he's a old man! You can't find this address but you eat and sleep like a log. This is Lakshmi's address. Must use this old man to trap that family. Why isn't anyone coming yet? Ring the bell. What happened? Hello master! What? When did you come? How do you do? l'm very fine, l'm angry because of hot sun. Anyway no problem, whatever it is, talk to me here only. l'll go from here only. You too want the same, right? Didn't l tell you? Okay master, please come in. Come in. He's my grandson Prasad. You may start grousing if l bring him without introducing him. Greet him. He's a great egoist. l think... What are you thinking? You want me to come in or go? Why are you asking like that? Please come in. Come in, silly boy! Come in, sir....come... This is my house, master. Very nice, whether it is yours or mine, l can't see anything, right? Come. Please come and sit here. Why are you sitting on floor? Please get up, sir. No problem, l'll sit on floor. No need to spoil your sofas. Please get up. You haven't changed a bit. Please come....sit here. That's fine. They'll wash their homes clean after people like us visit. To ward off evil eye cast. What are you saying sir? You haven't changed a bit. You please sit down. Amaravathi, Master has come, please get tea. Did you see? Didn't l tell you? They'll offer tea and coffee to visitors like us but they'll have Horlicks and Bournvita. Okay, tell me what would you like to have? Give me half of your property. Will you? Please have coffee. - Master, my wife Amaravathi. They're my sons. - Greetings, sir. They're my daughters-in-law. - Greetings, sir. Lakshmi, please come here. Come....please come. Master is here. My daughter Lakshmi. He's my grandson Pravin. - Good...very good. Mine is also very big family. All are gone. Only he's left. Wait...wait...you're keeping on his head. Why l came to you because, it seems he want passport, if it is necessary, he must stay here for 2 days, l'll stay here! Even if you wish nobody would wish to keep you! Are you saying even if l wish who would keep me? Nothing like that. l'll not stay but if it is necessary, my grandson will stay here for 2 days. You'll not have any problem. 4 kilos of rice, 4 brinjals, he'll bring snake gourd also, show him the kitchen, he'll cook his meals. lf you say like that we'll feel bad. Did he utter a word after coming here? He's very innocent boy. lf you talk non-stop, how can he talk? What are you saying? Nothing, send off grandpa safely in bus. Grandpa! What's this? You're here but voice is coming from there. ls he his real grandson? You say you're smart, couldn't you find difference between him and me? You both are using the same body spray. Did this help me? Putting grandpa in bus and lying to my mother. l packed my bag. Won't you tell me when you'll be back after roaming aimlessly? l'm going to Bangalore for a big business deal. Move away. l reached Lakshmi's home at 120 kmph at 40 degree Sun, and stopped just 2 metres away! l got a doubt whether to enter the house with left or right leg first. l'll break your legs. not you! Hold this. That cat! lt is torturing me every day. Please come in. Why do you hesitate? l entered meekly like that, family members who hesitated to ask if l want coffee or tea, l saw drastic change in 2 days, from small errands like changing Rs.1000 note, to lousy job of putting naphthalene balls in toilets, they've come so close to tell me all this. Though entire family accepted me as one of theirs, uncle still suspected me. Oh No! l think he has recognised me. What's it, uncle? Where did you go now? To wine shop! Balaji temple near wine shop. l went to pray for getting passport early and go abroad. Hail Lord Balaji! One day Lakshmi asked me to come to north side gate. l thought she called me to run some errand for her. l'll tell about you to my father. - Why? My grandpa took his permission, right? To stay here. l know all that. Neither you're his grandson nor he's your grandpa. You told me to impress your father instead of you. lmpressing means cheating and lying to get into house. Every is valid for love. Small lie, little bit of cheating, small dose of selfishness, everything put together is like Telugu New year 'Pachchadi'. l don't know how she understood my dialogue, from that day she stopped observing me. Like Tabu joins Nagarjuna's family in Krishna Vamsi's film 'Ninne Pelladatha', their family accepted me as a member. Like mixing half litre water in 10 litres of milk, they used me like that. Like hitting the highway, they entrusted me with baby shower of sister Vasantha. You don't know who sister Vasantha is, right? Lakshmi's younger sister-in-law. My elder sister. Like real sister. l was busy with work, l came out to bring a bunch of bananas. Oh, it's here, they left it here. l saw this sari somewhere! Oh no mother! Come here...come here... Come here l say! Mother! Come here! Mother, that is... Come near me. Fool! You said you're going to Bangalore for a big business deal. Why are you picking bananas on road? Please mother...l'll tell you later. - What will you tell later? What will you tell? - Please go away, mother. Okay, l'll and tell everything to your father. Something is wrong here. Wrong! Please go away. Please go away, mother. Oh No, he saw you. Please go, mother. Who is he? - l beg you, mother. lt was my mistake, please go, mother. What's the problem there, Prasad? Why is he calling you as Prasad? Who is she? Married women please come in. - Aunty! Married woman! Aunty invited 1 1 married women, uncle. 10 women are here. Rs.500 remuneration. She's 1 1th woman. But she's asking Rs.1 1 16. Very busy woman! She's refusing. lt's small matter, elderly woman. Let's pay her. Please come in, madam. You please go, l'll bring her, uncle. You said you'll pay, l'll bring her. - Bring her. Did l came to attend function? - Please mother. lf you don't come, l'll die, mother. My plan will flop! Please come, mother. Are you asking me to cheat others like you? How beauty is adding to her! is it because of immense wealth? As happiness of blessing douses this queen... As every hand here is adding beauty to her with sandalwood paste... Would the child be like Krishna who steals butter and plays flute? Would he be a great archer like Rama? Whether he's God or human, it'll be known in time... ls it that girl? - How did you know it, mother? l can know seeing her, anyone would do anything for her. Mother too was greatly impressed by Lakshmi. Don't create any trouble here, come home quickly. Okay? Every little or big step l took ended in grand success. With the same confidence and same enthusiasm, l took a wrong step. l didn't know it was wrong step till l took that step. When she entered bathroom, l entered next bathroom to clear my doubt. Rama built bridge on sea from Kanyakumari to Srilanka, l thought it was Hanuman or Monkey army's help. Now l understood that Rama could do it because of his love for Seetha. l'm very happy now. Because 900/0 of my job is over. Your entire family considers me as one of them. Your father took me to the temple thrice this week. Your mother who used to ask me to eat what she cooked. Now she asks me what l would like to have for dinner? Your elder brother wants my company to smoke, your second brother asks my advice to sell the shares, they've become so close to share all this with me. your sisters-in-law consider me as their own brother. You must see when Pravin calls me as uncle! l'm as happy as l'm getting awarded doctoral degree by Andhra University. Even your house servants feel l'm as their own. Just only you remain. No need to say l love you to me, just say yes, that's enough. Won't you? l did so much, can't l get an ayes from you? l'll plan how to make you say yes. You take bath and come, it won't be nice if anyone sees us. What? Father! Who are you? Are you here to disturb a well designed family? lsn't it you who lied that night for lift and got down at wine shop? l did that mistake unwittingly, uncle. lt's natural to make mistakes. lt must be like dot which can be wiped not like tattoo forever. l take extra care to keep dust and garbage from entering my home. l work like a repellant for my house. But garbage entered my home. That's why l waiting for it to cross my compound wall. Come l say! l'll talk to Lakshmi once... - Shut up! l don't want you to utter my daughter's name again. l'll not give you lift again, how can you expect me to give my daughter? l don't care who you are and why you came here! But if l see you anywhere near my house again, if my family faces any problem from you, l'll tear you into two! lf l see you again in this area or if my family faces trouble from you, l'll tear you into two! l thought about you... l loved and left you... l'm living for you only... l'm seeing myself in you... When the time came to open the letter and read... lt got burnt, my dear... You're very lucky, Sai. God gave you stone heart, tear less eyes, shameless body, and insensitive life... l was saying God created you very strong. But all are not like you, Sai. There are sensitive people too. l top such people. Second place is almost occupied by Sathyam Rajesh. Sathyam Rajesh? My friend's cousin's friend's cousin. Just as you experienced, Seemandhra-Telengana, in every street, at some gate, at any time, in the hands of a beautiful daughter's father, a sincere lover would be thrown out! Just as you had yesterday, the same insult, Sathyam Rajesh too got insulted in the next street, but Sathyam Rajesh who is in the second place in sensitivity, he attempted to commit suicide. - Did he die? He would but a passerby saved him. He's crying profusely. Please talk to him and enthuse him. Where is he? ls it wrong to fall in love? ls it wrong to fall in love? ls it wrong to fall in love? Do you've any shame? lf your lover's father throws you out of home, will you commit suicide? Are you really a man? Please calm down. Tell me what had happened? ls it wrong to fall in love? ls it wrong to fall in love? ls it wrong to fall in love? Why are you repeating the dialogue three times? l can't bear it. Tell me about your love. l saw her for the first time in park. Where is the star? The maiden who is creating chaos in my heart... Next we met in coffee shop. Love is not easy, you can't win love... What are the conditions for love? What are the secrets of love? One day we went to shopping mall to buy clothes. Lonely time... Personalized service... Your mischief... lt lit fire of passion... Along with trying out new clothes... The matter reached her father's ears. He called me. l thought to discuss. After l went l came to know. lt was to fight. l climbed the wall to escape. He slapped me! He held me by my collar and threw me out of the house! He threatened to break my legs if l talk about love again. ls it wrong to fall in love? ls it wrong to fall in love? ls it wrong to fall in love? - No! Mine is one side love, the girl has no clarity. You both are clear, right? What's your problem then? Let's settle this, call all our boys. Come on, boys. What's the name? Not your name. Your father-in-law's name. Come out! ls it him? Why did you come here again? Go away form here if not l'll tear you into two. What will you tear? ls his head croton to cut? Who are you? We're his friends to settle his love matter. Do you think l'll get scared of you bring few friends? Go away from here. Why are you threatening us? You don't have that much scene, they both are majors. Call your daughter. l'll not call her, go away. l told you to call your daughter out. l said l'll not call her. He told you to call your daughter. You fool! l don't have daughters at all! l've two sons only! Sons? His second son is tall, fair and handsome. You too would like him. There's my prince! Stop your mischievous looks... Don't incite mischievous thoughts in me... Later wee met in a coffee shop. lt's a meeting of love and romance... What does it say? lf there's will, there's way... lf you say yes, l'll do and show to this world... One day we went to buy clothes. What should l do till we tie the knot? l'll become yours forever... Bloody! ls it wrong to fall in love? Wrong? Totally wrong! Not you, Navin... Come here, dear. l'm in frustration with love failure, why did you get me into this bloody sentiment? What's this expression, Bablu? Do something and save my love, sir. You must help my love to succeed. l didn't this force in anyone till now. Please do something, sir. lf you both ever come before me ...get lost! Please do something, you can do, sir. Thank God! Don't come near me. l'll throw stones at you. ls it wrong to fall in love? ls it wrong to fall in love? ls it wrong to fall in love? Get into the car. Get in! Mother told me to get milk. You can take curd sachets by evening, get in. Please sit. You too! Would you like to have water? lt seems he hit at 9.20 pm. She came home crying. You got them married as their parents, right? Tell her what you want to! The moment l knew he hit my daughter, l would've killed him. But l'm waiting to tell you and then go for the kill. What do you want me to do? We didn't expect this to happen. Will you please stop it? Why are you saying sorry? lf you say sorry, l too share 500/0 of it. Uncle, kill him. Kill him and conduct his obsequies. Marry her off to some American lndian. Next time he'll hit her there. Catch a flight, kill him and conduct his obsequies, Next time get her married to someone in Australia. He'll also hit her, kill him too and conduct his obsequies. Then, you go and ask your daughter, uncle. ls she's a wife or prostitute? Anyway you're not worried about your son-in-law hitting her or your daughter crying, You're angry because you didn't conduct this marriage. Had you arranged this marriage with wedding cards, rituals, feast and dowry, you wouldn't be speaking like this, uncle. You know how you'd respond to this, Won't husband and wife ever fight? lf he comes home with tension, you must pacify him with cool behaviour, would anyone fight with him then? Aunty, you! Do you've any sense? l've been living with your father for 30 years, did l do like this any time? He hit me so many times and l shouted on him many times. Did we ever wash linen in public? You'd have talked to her and sent her back to her home. But it's not like that here. Because you didn't conduct their marriage. Since you didn't do it, you don't care if it succeeds or fails, that's your ego! Uncle, just two hearts are enough to fall in love, just two friends are enough to marry, but they need parents support for all their lives. Since that's not happening, 900/0 of love marriages are making 700/0 lawyers richer. Think over it, uncle. You're en elder man, you know things much better. What could be settled over a phone call, do you've to go to court? Tell me. - Where are you? Outside. Your father-in-law wants to talk to you. Talk to him. Take it. Father-in-law! Are you fine? Sorry, father-in-law, a small tiff, l'll come and take her home. No problem. Did you've lunch? - Just now. Tomorrow is Sunday, come for evening dinner. You can her home. l've a very good son-in-law. l wouldn't have got such a son-in-law even if l had spent millions. You're right, he works with lnfosys, it seems his salary is Rs.1 lakh a month! All the credit for this goes to his friend Sai. He's very good boy. - Yes. Though you didn't have any fight, l got you both patch up with your father-in-law, since l too can meet Lakshmi, l planned this. What actually had happened was... l entered the house to impress her father. Very bad horoscope, right? l got caught for my silly mistake and her father threw me out. After l tried many times but she didn't like to meet me. That's why l planned this. One shot two angry birds! What do you say? She's coming. Please listen to me. lf you don't stop, l'll not eat. What bothers me if you don't eat? Anyway you had a go at food just now. Did you see? l forgot whether l ate or not lost in your thoughts. l'm eating again and again. l've told you earlier also, Sai. l'll marry if my father selects a dog. l told you to give a try. You failed, it's all over. lf my father is asked to write 10 names he hates, he would write your name 1 1 times. For the present he may not like, infact my friend and his father-in-law were at loggerheads, but l united them! Why would l separate you from your father? l'll take care of all that. - Give a try! But please leave me alone. l'm telling you again, l'll marry a dog if my father says so. Will you marry a dog? What will you do marrying a dog? Will you take it for a walk? You're proud because l'm after you. May l tell you this, you looked like an angel when l saw you first time. After that always looked like a devil. Bloody loose tongue! Stop! l'll fall at your feet! You fell like gentle rain drops... Next moment you vanished away... You're love thought... You're my love... My life is soaring high in air with your love... My heart says go after her... My thoughts are after you saying yes... ls it for that girl? Mad boy! Today is Sunday, she'll not come. Come. - Father. Come l say! - Why? Nothing, come with me. Why did you bring me here, father? Here... - Nothing, son. What are you doing? Come! Come! Come. - Greetings, tell me. ls your daughter in home? Call her. - Why? What happened? Call her, don't get tensed. What's this, father? - Her name is Kumari. Why did you call me now, father? l was making dosas. My daughter Kumari. Here's the girl you were ogling at every day! Didn't recognise her, right? With make-up then and now without make-up. Girls look like that when you fall in love. They look like this after marriage. You must see them like this for all your life. Seeing her like that you chase, love, marry her in registrar's office, and when you take her home, in about 3 months, unable to see her like this, father, l made a mistake, l don't you want you to regret later, Watch her now itself! ls she okay to you? Do you know what are you saying, father? You came to my home, rang the bell, why are you leaving after showing my daughter in bad light? l didn't show her in bad light but helped her. My son is trying sincerely for your daughter. As his father l shouldn't say this. My son is a rogue! lf he tries sincerely, your daughter's life would get ruined. Tell me now, did l help you or harmed you? Thank so much, master. You go and make dosas. Go inside, l'll throw away your make-up kit. What's this, Sai? l was fixing your marriage with the girl you like, why did you walk out? Did l say l like her? You were ogling at her like hell every day! Father, switch off your mood and listen to me carefully. The girl l like is different but seeing a different girl. l want to do something but doing something else. Do you know how my situation is! My life has been hauled, mauled like hell! ln the bad mood l'm now in, give me your gun and leave me in Pakistan, l'll settle things once for all in 30 minutes. What's your problem, son? Didn't get it yet? l love a girl, father. But... But how much l try she's not responding to me. Any girl l see appears like her. What should l do now, father? Don't worry about her parents' rejections, whether you're there in her heart or not, know that first! Your fianc's phone call. He's waiting in coffee shop downstairs. He has ordered cappuccino for you, he wants you there quickly. Greetings, doctor. Don't take my goodness... Use it thrice a day with a glass o water, milk or butter milk... Don't take it easily. lf l get angry... Operation is unavoidable. lt'll cost Rs.1 .5 lakhs. You've eyes to see, mouth to speak, good sense of dressing, you've money to pay for your coffee, what happened to your brain? No! lt's not seen even in X-ray. What? Are you making fun of me? No, you're shouting at him for your anger, l'm treating him for his piles. Coffee should be sipped not to be thrown on coats. Treat patients in clinic not in coffee shops. Sai, don't ever try to play your cheap dirty tricks on me. Will you call me here by claiming you're my fianc in office? Lakshmi, l was waiting for you outside, what are you doing inside? Shouting at me your habit, right? Go ahead. Brother, come here. What did they order? Does soup suit his face? - No, sir. What will you get if you serve him? l'll get Rs.10000 salary as l get every month. lf you pour soup on him. - Rs.20000 loss, sir. Why? - l need 2 months to find a new job. l'm planning to give you Rs.20000 a month till you find a new job. What do you say? How is aunty? What else? Serve soup on table not on my dress. Soup is very hot, sir. l'll meet you later. Without playing drama come to the point straight. Okay, whether l'm in your heart or not. l'm repeating it again. Am l there in your heart or not? No. No! - ls it? Then, why did you hug me in village that day? lt happened unwittingly because of emotional situation. But my life went to dogs with that incident. l don't know that. Would you've hugged anyone in that situation? lt proves l'm there in your heart. l said no. l've the incident in village to prove l'm there. But what proof have you got to prove l'm not there? How will you prove that l'm not in your heart? l'll prove as you like. Okay, let's hug just like that day. lf l don't get the same feelings l had then, if feelings between us don't create any sensation, if l feel you don't have any feeling for me, to tell you harshly, if you don't get tempted, l'll never again disturb you in life. lf l've any feeling that you still have a feeling for me, l'll never leave you! What the hell are you saying? Do you know that? As time passes, you're become more stupid. Will you hug me again? You've gone mad. Join a mental asylum. Are you scared of falling to temptation? l'll chase you, l'll scare you. l'll bring you to my way! Come to my home, my dear... Come to my home... As daughter-in-law to my parents... As sister-in-law to my younger brother and sister... Doors to my heart would open as you step into the home with your right leg... Keep your purse safely from thieves... When the boy you love seeks, don't hide your heart... We can stop gushing waters with a lock... We can never hide love how much ever you may try to... Lift your head, look into my eyes once... Why are you so adamant? Don't you want a companion? Enough of frowning and making faces... How beautiful you are even when angry... Once l become your dot, l'll never leave you... You disturbed my sleep and moreover scolding me... My heart is in pain and thrilled... Why are you terrorizing me like Goddess Mahakali? l'll make you my queen, give me your heart... l'm Do Re Mi, you're my Pa So... Do you've concepts in love proposal too? Non-veg thoughts are not good. Can you flatter a girl with just one hug? She hates you so much, why are you after her? Sister, Lakshmi is just a colleague to you. At the most a friend. But she's my angel. lt's so good when she hates me, what if she loves me? l'll go mad! Don't go that far. l too felt like that only. l thought she's not in my life. The moment l came to know l'm there in her heart, l decided that moment itself. lt was okay then, it could've been, but now she says you're not in her heart. lf God gives a struggling his number to call, will you give a missed call? This also like that only. l don't know if wealthy and powerful people are happy in life or not, sister. But one who has a good life partner will be happy all his life. Didn't you find any other angel than her? We build a temple for Goddess. We don't go in search of Goddess after building temple. l've already decided. But you must think from her point of view also, right? Bloody point of view. She'll reject Shahjahan who built Taj Mahal and marry a mason selected by her father. Sister, advice me as your brother, when l'm preparing for lAS, will you push me to work hard and encourage me or not? Why don't you encourage me now? This is like lAS to me, l'll try hard and succeed. Leave me, sister. - l beg you! You can talk to get anyone's support in 10 minutes. Forget about me leaving you, l request you both to leave me alone. Come. What happened? l'll find from her and tell you, father. You go inside. l want to talk to you. Okay, let's go to my home. Would you like to have coffee or tea? Would anyone have coffee and tea at this hour? Usually l'll have drinks. What did you say with Pavithra? Nothing, asked if she knows anyone who can lend Rs.3 lakhs @ 30/0 interest. Did she ask you? l didn't mean about your interest. About your concept you told her. lf God gives a struggling man to call in distress, should we call till God responds our call? Am l acting with some ulterior motive inside? Do women like us... Don't we trust real love? Do we women reject Shahjahan who built Taj Mahal and marry a mason on father's advice. You're not thinking of building Taj Mahal for me, Sai. You want to paint the Taj Mahal already built and use it. lf l hug you once, can you find whether l love you or not? Not just once but l'll give you chance for 3 times 3 days and 3 hours! Prove in these three chances if l love you or not. lf you fail to prove it, either get your father transferred from here or delete me from your memory. 3 chances! Decide date time and place and send me SMS. Not for having feeling for you or liking your concept. To get rid of you. He sent message at 6 am. Recently we got a couple married right? His friend. lt seems they've left for Tirupati. He has fixed program in their home. l challenged him in a burst of anger. But l feel shy to go. Please talk to him and get this bet cancelled. Look there! You called him at 7.30 pm but he's here at 7.30 am. Come. Come. Sister-in-law, brother told me to give this key to you. What sort of a man he is? - Any man is like that. lf you chance would he leave it easily? Take bath evening and go to meet him. Will you also join me? Are you going to night show film? What are these feelings? l never had such feelings. Did l challenge him in anger or did l do it wantonly? Oh father! Somehow l must get rid of Sai. But what's this feeling? Why isn't it leaving me? There's some magic in him. ls he conducting any special prayers? Lakshmi, control yourself. Under any circumstance, don't give up your aim. l'm here at the strike of 7.30 pm. ls it my problem? Why should l call him? l'll not call him. l'll not give a missed call also. Why is he scaring me? Why am l waiting for him? lf l hadn't hugged him there l wouldn't have faced any trouble. lt was my mistake. 5 minutes grace period is also over. Tomorrow he'll come saying love, l'll take him to task. No... Just because he didn't touch you, why are you stopping me also? Will you shut your mouth? l can understand your feelings. - Why should l feel? Why? He lost a chance, why do you pity me? - lsn't it? He lost a chance. He must feel sad and he must get angry. You're feeling bad as if you expected something and it didn't happen. l feel embarrassed to wait and come without meeting him. As if he's Gabbar Singh and you're embarrassed. Okay, l'll do one thing. l'll arrange your second meeting. lf he acts any smart this time, l'll rip out his skin. Okay? Please, get rid of him from my life. l'll be ever grateful to you. l'll get peace of mind. Tomorrow evening program, he'll come to pick you up. l'm getting bored, shall we talk our way? Watch the road and drive. Someone may hit the car. This is one way. - Yours too is one way. l'll convey. Will you please give Rs.20 worth jasmine? Why are you buying jasmine? Are you going crazy? Shouldn't l keep jasmine also in car? As freshener! Take it, sir. Hey you girl, what did you think? Okay, if you want to use like that, let's use it. Our program is in Pavithra's house, right? Will it be comfortable? Why did you stop near medial shop? Nothing, looking for safety. - Safety? Yes, can't hold myself in that moment. Something may happen, it may be not with us when we need it. We'll not stop because we don't have it. We'll go ahead and regret for it after 3 months. Safety is very important. They show ad on TV also, didn't you see it? Wait, l'll get it. You're doing too much. l'll break your teeth. Get going, forget about safety. You may not need but l do need it. Are you mad? - Yes, l'm going mad. l'm dying with severe headache. l want to buy tablets for safety, why are you stopping me? l know what you want to buy? What? - Those things. What do you mean by those things? Those things. - What are those things? Okay, why would you get headache now? l don't know why but when l get into romantic mood l get headache. l'm always like this from childhood days. Okay, l'll get it, what's the tablet? When we add it to water, it effervesces, Disprin! Don't overact, get going. Didn't he give change? Where are you going at this hour? My clothes have become dirty, l want to wash clothes in Bhimli beach and dry it in Ramakrishna beach. What did l tell you now? Look, a girl must put motif in courtyard, salt in curry, and bed in room. They mustn't put questions like this, you know. Okay. Where's your mother? - She went to Khammam. Khammam? She went to attend core committee meeting of Andhra-Telengana software Mothers-in-law. She won't have beers in the name of core meeting, right? Nothing like that. Just now she called, she wanted me to take your updates. Take a low angle also. Status? Headline is Love Deal! Tag line is Trend creating Subramanyam for friend's love. You mean love deal? A sweet and soft love story that impressed me. Who is it? My friend's cousin's best friend's cousin! l'll go now, bye. When will you be back? lf Potti Sriramulu's wife had asked him when would he come back? Would there be Andhra Pradesh now? There mustn't be calculations and expectations for agitations and philosophies. This looks great! Post it in Whatsapp and say hats off. ls your shopping over? Can we come now? - He left just now, come quickly. Did she ask us to come? Why are you laughing? Nothing....come. Subramanyam may come at any time. That's the room. Why did you slap him? l pulled to warn you but why did you slap him? You're going inside, is it okay? Sister, can you get me some water? - What will you do with water inside? l'll sprinkle it on hot iron, you got me slapped too. Get water, sister. Why are you closing the door? Why are you opening the door? You want me to open or close? Close it What for we are here and what are you doing? That is....l told you... l get headache in romantic mood. Don't do anything crazy. What happened? ls it wrong to fall in love? You said you were going out to deal an interesting love story. Not interesting love story but irritating love story. How can two men love each other? Are two men lovers? Shall l upload it in Facebook? l'll stamp you to death, get me water. No... - Get me water. Want me to upload in Facebook? lt's Sai's phone. Will you blackmail me? Watch now! l'll delete my video! Come. Who is inside? Lakshmi is working inside. She's working inside and you're reading paper here. Sai too is inside. - Sai too? What is he doing? They both are having a private conversation. When they're having private conversation, are you helping love with social service? Call him. No... First call them out. Poor things. - Poor things? Someone is here, open the door. Who is it? ls my house lodge to you? ls my wife pimp? Brother-in-law? - What brother-in-law? Are you playing smart wit me? - Stop, brother-in-law. Why are you calling me brother-in-law? You're doing too much. Sai, your time is over. Good riddance! Brother-in-law, l've your video with me. lt got deleted. ls it okay? lt got deleted long back. You went overboard. - Deleted it? Deleted it. Brother-in-law! - What brother-in-law? lf l see you here again, l'll blow up your head. Brother-in-law! Mashed mutton is ready. Those who want it, stand in separate line. Mother-in-law! Won't you give me that? Stop, mother-in-law! - Stop! Mother! - Stop! lt's not sin even to kill you. - Stop, mother. See, how your mother is thrashing me. What's this mother? Are you hitting software Subramanyam? ls he software Subramanyam? My foot! He's mashed mutton specialist in a mutton shop. Mashed mutton specialist? This fool cheated you and me! Why did you leave software job to work in mutton shop? l lost my job in recession. Unable to decide what to do... lf you lose job, you should've joined as driver. Why did you work in a mutton shop? My father had a mutton shop. When you said you love him, you said his father too was software engineer. You told me like that, right? l said my father is MS. MS means mutton shop, right? She mistook it for MS office, how can l be responsible for it? How many lies you've reeled out? Mother, stop! Okay, l'll get him some job with people l know. Okay? Which job? - Software. Okay, do it properly. lf you go to mutton shop again, l'll make mashed meat of you. You carry on, mother-in-law. Miss Lakshmi Anand! Come here, dear. Father! - Come here. What happened, dad? Father. - l'm happy. Most important stage in my daughter's marriage. See them, select the best one you like. l'll fix it. What's this new habit, dad? Whatever you like is my choice. You select for me. You say like that? Okay, we liked this very much. How is it? - Okay, dad. l'm getting late to office, shall l go? Wait a minute, please. Why are you thanking me, dad? l must thank you. Every father would wish to thank his daughter in such times. But he misses to say in the busy work of conducting the marriage. For a father like me raising a son to become a successful man is not a big deal. But raising a daughter, getting her good education, raise her into a young woman, getting her married to a man without any bad remark, it is very great achievement in these modern times. Such father would 100 out of 100! l'm scoring 100 marks in this. This is not my credit but it's your complete support. Thanks brings to my memory. Another one, where's the cover? Father. Take it. What's this? - Rs.1 lakh. Why? - A small gift. l can give any as gift to you personally now only. lf l give anything after marriage, it belongs to your husband and ln-laws too. Remember that. Along with this gift, take this car key also. Go anywhere you want to and buy anything you wish. Your wish only, don't ask anyone's opinion. Take leave from office, till evening.... Thanks, dad. - Go...go my dear,. No need to make an entry where you're going in the register also. As you wish! Today is aunt's birthday. How do you do? l'm not fine. This smile? Flowers keep smiling even when they get plucked. Me too like that. Okay aunt, l'll come to the point directly. Laila-Majnu, Salim-Anarkali, Shahjahan-Taj Mahal, all these are nothing, l don't know them, there's only one love l've seen and met in my life. Devika...l mean you! People pray in distress. l'm praying to you. My love is surviving on ventilators. ln a situation of unable \ to get oxygen also., You must save it. My love is the most selfish love in this world. As selfish as farmer looking at sky wishing it rains, my wish of getting Lakshmi is also so selfish. When l come from office in future, l wish the girl l love opens the door to me. Whether it is tears or her, decide yourself. Look, l don't know whether to get angry or pity you! Neither you can get angry nor pity me! You don't have both for me. There's only one thing, that is love. You won't express it. Don't talk like a stupid. Wedding cards are also ready. What's this like a mad man? Sai, you're a good man, like aunt said happiness in pant and shirt. Don't ruin your life unnecessarily. Do you know what your problem is? lt's me! Remove me from your heart. You can't bear when l get married. You've good future. l'm sure a good girl would be there for you. Do you know why l'm telling you this! You must be fine. lf you're fine, l'll be the first person to be happy. Wait. - Tell me. Girls like you have plenty of emotions when necessary and quotations when not needed. But l still have a chance. As you promised, l wish to use my third chance here. Air, water, earth here knows you love me. Except you! l tried to forget you but l came to know, l was trying to kill myself not forget. There are many social networks to express my feelings. But to express honest feelings, you need a clean heart. With the same heart l'm expressing my love. Are girls like this only? You camouflage emotions very well. People compare women with earth. But it is wrong. There's gold, diamonds, petrol and many things inside earth. lf we find it, we can unearth it. But even if we know there love, we can get it out. Hugging you is like hugging a rock. You've build a wall between your heart and your love. Live all your life behind that wall. lt's beastly to touch women who dislikes you. For touching you though you hate me, please forgive me. Go away. This is the last hug for both of us. There's no chance of talking about this in my life. What's this hell? Will you squeeze and stamp my heart? Will you take me to the end and dump? lt's like topping state in lnter and failing in EAMCET. Won't you see love in my heart? Though l'm praying fervently, will you do as you wish? l was living in imaginations with you as my other half... l'm giving my half which is without you to yourself... Do whatever you want to do with it... My heart never asked to get this thing and that thing... First time it made a wish to get you... l promised it that you won't say no to me... What am l to tell my heart now? My tears are drowning me furiously... What would become of me? Please don't cry son. l can't bear it, son. l can console if son fails in exam. l can console son failing in business. But l don't know how to console a son who failed in his love. Not only me, no mother knows that. Please don't cry, my son. l can't bear to see you in tears. Do it quickly, marriage isn't a week away but today evening. You may fall down. Did you call the grooms' people? Have they left or not? Not yet, father. - Do it.- l will. Hubby, water. What's this? lt's daughter's marriage, mother must be bright with happiness. Why are you dull? Come here. Hubby, our daughter is missing, she was seen 5 minutes ago. l suspect something. Bring him wherever he may be! What did we do wring with you? Though you were caught red handed, spared because l didn't want to ruin your future. Even a snake will bite only if we stamp on it, Whatever l may tell or do, you'll never get sense. lt has become fashion for you boys to humiliate parents' in marriage halls. Tell me, where have you taken my daughter? Leave me, uncle. ls that why they brought me here hitting all the way? For what else? What's your arrogance? - Nothing, uncle. When they were hitting me, l didn't react fearing l may be wrong. After coming here, l realised l've done nothing wrong. That's why l repaid them. Didn't you do anything wrong? Did l take your daughter with me? Not just girls, even boys can forget. But it'll cost a full bottle. l did spend, l forgot her. Boys too can make their parents happy like girls. l asked my father, what should l do to make him happy? He said marry! NRl proposal, Rs.4 crores dowry with green card. Just before l tied the knot, your daughter came and asked me, uncle. What about me then? They shouted at me and spat on my face before leaving. You gave birth to her and raised her for 20 years yet you didn't know, that your daughter will leave home 5 minutes before her marriage, How can l know about it, uncle? lf we know we would fall for a girl somewhere some day, we'll never go to that place on that particular day, uncle. You raised your daughter for 20 years. l struggled a year to make her fall in love with me. You wrote in your diary about raising your son, they'll keep on rejecting parents for every little thing, but they always leave the most important decisions to parents. But daughters are not like that, uncle. They leave all the little things to parents' decision, but they decide about important things in life. Because they're more interested in 80 future years than 20 years of past. Parents consider sons as property and daughters as respect. Never think like that. Think them as your children only. Comedy of the situation is, you're fighting as father of a girl, for the same girl l'm fighting here as her lover. From time immemorial man has been fighting for woman, they're always happy, only we are fighting! We don't have any community feeling, uncle. lf a girl loves a boy, she'll find who he is, what he is, when she likes everything about him, and if you give daughter in marriage to him, l don't know if you know this or not, boys here give more respect to father-in-law than father. They always live at his feet. But you don't do like that. 2You send hooligans to hit him. Come get them bashed up, uncle. Bash people who give up love for little things. But never hit a man who gave up everything for love, uncle. We find pure love in certain age and time, if you kill that love also, we'll never find love again in life. Boys like you keep on loving a girl even after she marries another man. lf you get married to the same girl, you don't love her for a year also. When we love there will be only love. But after marriage, there's a family. lf we break a coconut in temple, it'll become two halves. lf we distribute it to devotees, it'll be six pieces. lf we make chutney, we can serve many. Uncle, l can't build Taj Mahal for your daughter. But l can afford to buy her meals in Taj hotel. l know you raised your daughter like your mother. lf you send her to my home, l'll look after her like my mother. l can't promise anything more, uncle. l can't convince you. Already my life is ruined unable to convince your daughter. The ball is now in your court, uncle. You're right. As a lover you're clear. But l'm worried about her. l raised her here. What's this, dear? There may be people who could lie after swearing on Bhagavad Gita. There may be people who lie after swearing on God. But l've always told truth before you, father. l love him so much! After killing love, l don't have the heart to cry before lover's mausoleum. l think lovers must sacrifice something. You sacrificed love for your family. l sacrificed my family for love. Marriages aren't just laughter, there are cries behind the marriage hall. lt could be bride's lover! lt could be the groom who missed out marriage in the last minute. lt could be father who conducts daughter's marriage unwillingly. lf no one cries, at least the onion peeler in kitchen would shed tears. Crying is common. Give me quickly, bhai. Mashed mutton for me. - l'm on it. Leg piece, bhai. Give him leg piece. He'll never change. Come home, l'll take you to task. Stop crying. lt's embarrassing before others. lnstead of sending me away, why not allow me to stay here? She's not feeling sad. Will you work in mutton shop here? Get going. Bye, brother-in-law. Are you going to foreign, brother-in-law? What about that? Mad boy, foreign means you thought America? There everything is...
