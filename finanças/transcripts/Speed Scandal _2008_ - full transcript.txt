He's been milking it too long. Then there are openings in his ads, right? Pil-joong Bong the slimy reporter really stripped him bare. That's his specialty. That hyena. You sure there are openings? Yup Wait, I saw him earlier. Here comes the hyena. Reporter Bong! What brings you here? Thought I smelled something around here. What smell... Heard your wedding date's set. Yes, it's in the fall. You're coming, right? Of course. I saw your big exclusive on Joon-young Kim. I'll be lucky if he doesn't come and kill me. A reporter is bound to get into a few scrapes when out to get the truth.

The single mother. Oh that Jung-nam! You didn't meet your father? What are you doing here? Bo-kyung Hwang is my mom. So? Don't know her? Should I? Sure you do. I'm sure I don't. When you were in ninth grade. The girl next door. 5 years older. Your first. I feel like I know her, Jung-nam Hwang. My grandmother's house is there. I visited often when I was young. Your father was in ninth grade? I have a friend who...you know, did it, in ninth grade, too. Make sure you go to your father. Go to him! Say hello to your grandpa. - Hi, Grandpa! - Wait! No! - Grandpa! - Stop! Give me that! Go! Hurry! Listen, it won't be long. Just keep quiet and stay right here! - But he's got to pee. - Pee in your pants! Please? Help me out, here. Sweating, already? Finally, I get to see your place. It's nice. Look babe, tonight... Tonight? Want me to get loose? You smell so good. You're going to keep me standing? It's the robot vacuum. That's the bubble bath. Why you... I'm not an easy gal. I have something important to tell you. What's that? Let's break up. Listen, I'll say it slowly. Fast would be better. Go ahead. Let's think this through clearly, Miss. - You, young lady, --- - I'm a mother. - I'm a mom. - Whatever! This is crazy! Some people send in their stories and feel comfortable with me. Like a friend, a brother, an uncle... And a father. Not that! How the hell do I have a daughter your age! Bo-kyung? I feel sorry for what happened to her. I cried my heart out over there. But it was my first and only time! I remember everything! It can't be me! I didn't even aim right! You aimed well. How can a boy in ninth grade make a kid? I did in tenth grade. Damn it, who are you? I'm Ki-dong Hwang! Not you! Look Miss. What you're doing is a crime. Forced entry! 3 years or $5,000 in fines! Want to go to jail? You want us to go? You should never have come. But it's his bedtime. It's my bedtime, too. There's no bus at this hour. Take care. Actor Joon-young Kim's sex video revealed? He's so over. Poor guy. Goodnight, grandpa. What's all the noise! Good morning, Grandpa! You asked for breakfast. I cooked a lot. But don't eat too much. Look. I've thought it over. You can't be my daughter, Miss. Stop calling me, Miss. Your last name's Hwang. Mine's Nam. Hwang's my mom's last name. Huang Bo Gyung, Huang Jung Nam, Huang Gi Dong You look nothing like me. Your eyes are... You can't see my eyes when I smile. Lips! They're totally different! Totally lucky. Let's get a DNA test. Great idea. - If you're not my daughter... - If I am? You're going to jail. Actor Joong-young Kim's video is... You cant just claim to be my daughter and... Veterinary Hospital Classic! Now, that's a story. I knew you'd mess up. You're the only one I can trust, man. A DNA test at a dog house? Hey, this is not a dog house. Sorry, a dog hospital. Such novel comments. So rustic. Why do the test? It's so obvious She's your kid. Shut up. How long will it take? 10 days. Weren't you a drummer once? Oh, that? You were so cool back then. Haven't changed a bit! What song did you like? You know the band? You remember me? Your daughter's so pretty! What's the kid's name? Ki-dong Hwang! Come here, Ki-dong. Have some candy. Orange or grape flavor? Not too much or your teeth will rot. She's yours. 100 percent. Kids need to grow up where the air is fresh. See! You're scratching! You scratched, didn't you! That's atopic dermatitis! It starts with scratching then you die! You have to live in the country! The air's terrible here. Cars race around everywhere! Kids get run over here all the time! Go out and look! Have a seat. It must've been hard raising a kid by yourself. Well, kind of. Your mom was my first and only love. We had to part because we loved each other. Your mom hid you because of that. She didn't want to hold me back. But I wish I could've known back then. I'm sorry. I'm a good singer. I love Korean food. I wasn't rebellious when I was young. Just got pregnant. -As you can see, I'm irresistibly cute. -Of course. I'm leaving. I'm going! Don't stop me! I respect your decision. -I respect your decision. -Have a drink, dad. How could something like this happen to me? Ki-dong! Come here and have a drink. He's just a kid. It's okay. He can learn to drink early. - One more bottle? - One more! Grand... I have a meeting. Remember your promise last night? Ah, sure. It's just till the end of the year. Then we're out of here. Next week's guests are coming? Yes, by 5 p.m. - Check on them again. - Okay. Heard there's a killer singer. She's a real pro. - Want to check it out? - Her name's Jae-in. Be my guest and handle it. About Jung-nam the single mom... People are writing in wondering about her. - Our ratings are down, too. - True. Our ratings won't plummet because she stopped writing in. I wouldn't be so sure. Even the director mentioned her. Since when did he start caring so much about our show. Then tell him to do it. Now, there's an idea. You shoot a commercial and now you're bored of radio? Of course not, sir. You! Didn't you tell him? How the ratings shot up when her story was mentioned? - You know? - I've been thinking, sir. Instead of just waiting for her, why don't we find her? I have a friend who's really good at finding people. Let's find her and have her on the show with her dad, too. Good idea. It'll be a piece of cake finding her. Yeah! I like it. Have her on the show. Should I get right on it? Then I'll make the call. Stop! Look. Let's not taint the beauty of the story. Keep the mystique going. If we bring her in for a show, then what? Think about it. Why aren't you writing? The radio. Write to the show! When did I ever do that? You took the credit card back! It's my credit card! You're so mean. That's not being mean! It's my credit card! Fine! I'll erase it! Look! Of course you should! Man, there's nothing to write. Aw, come on! Move! I'll do it! That's no way to write a story! My loving father gave me his credit card and said... 'A credit card is no big deal, I'll give you anything you want'. And laughed heartily. So I decided to stop being a nuisance, and stop burdening my dad! Will my baby be okay? My ass... What? If you ever thought about finding me, please don't! Let's not taint the beauty of an anonymous story. The laundry! My father adores my son. My noisy little son keeps the TV blaring, and has the sofa all to himself. Always so giving and kind. Sacrificing and devotional that's my father. Get me some water. Took us on a cruise? Yeah, right! I've never been on a paddle boat. Bought clothes from a department store? Fine! I'll take you! Wow, your father plastered you with expensive clothes? Thank you for writing to us, Jung-nam. Up next is our Visual Radio Show. We'll meet the semi-finalists of our singing contest. We'll talk with the four groups after a commercial break. Hello. Hello. Good to see you. It's me. What did you say? What is it? Take a guess. What do you feel like for dinner? You choose. I'll buy. I want steak. Just eat sushi rolls. But I want steak. Sorry. Sorry for being late. Afternoon Radio with Hyun-soo Nam Hyun-soo! You're on! Ah, up next on our Visual Radio Show... We have five singing contestants in the studio for the contest. That was Dae-hoon Pi our fourth contestant. What a winning performance. The winner will be decided by our listeners voting in. But really. That's it for our contestants. Wait. There's one more. Jae-in Hwang? Hello. You have a unique name. Is it an English name like John or Jane? No, it means 'be gentle' in Korean. My mom named me. I hope you lead a gentle life. Will you please get on the stage? Visual Radio, with the entire nation watching. Don't get scared of millions watching you. She'll be singing, 'Maybe' by Young-joon Choi. The dress...Nice and old to suit the old song. Perfect. Ready? Go! Probably a little nervous. Better luck next time. Pretty good. Damn right. Drop the contest. No way. I'm sorry for everything. Don't do this. I'm also sorry, so... Why does it have to be my show! You said to enter it. Okay, I know it's all thanks to you! Our ratings are up because of you. Let's just call in sick. Say your appendix burst! It burst two years ago. Why you! You practice arguing with me? You never back down, do you! You should focus on raising your kid, not go around singing! Didn't you ever learn to use your head! What? It's probably because I grew up without a dad. Single mothers have dreams, too. What about Ki-dong? What will you do with him when you come to the studio? I can take him with me. No way! I know everyone in the station! Word can get out! How about kindergarten? Would you like that, son? Hey, kid. Who am l? Grandpa. This is your grandfather. He had three sons. The second son is my dad. The first son had two sons. But our last names are different. Fine! A daughter! The last names are different, then. Let's start over. Grandpa had three sons, and the second son is my father. And the oldest daughter had two sons. Why so many sons? Who cares! Its not like I gave birth to them! Who am l? My uncle. How? My dad's grandpa's second son's son. Your parents? Good job. -The director will be in soon. - Thank you. He's a distant nephew. Nah, nah, nah, nah, boo, boo! You're Mr. Stinky! Hey, kid! Come over here and sit down. What are you looking at? He's not my son. Any cute girls? Anyone you like? What's her name? Tell me! Really? What did the director say? Go in and play. I'm watching TV. You're curious? You want in? Be quiet. That's why we were whispering. That show's funny. Who watches that? I do. Relax and meditate You laughed! I did not! I saw you! No way! Stop it. I'm hungry. I went to a club last night. First time in three years. Wonder why I ever got married. The hooters on the ladies dancing... Oh, please. What? I don't like them big. Sue him. I'll be a witness. Maybe I should. Jae-in Hwang! Hers are perfect. Got to love the young gals. She can sing, but doesn't she look cheap? She must be from the country looking so hick. But you got to admit, she's pretty sexy. True, country girls like sex more. Those hooters and her singing... She was awesome. In bed, girls like that go... You heinous bastard! She's a contestant! A young girl! You have a daughter! What if someone says that about your kid? Make sure you sue him! Bastards like him should wear a chastity belt! -Damn it! -What did I say? I'd like to thank you for taking care of my nephew. What kind of food do you like? Please be more attentive to your nephew. There's a girl who Ki-dong likes. But she says he dresses tacky and won't play with him. His clothes are very worn out. Welcome. He's my dad's grandpa's second son's son! She's my niece. Don't mind him. I want to buy some elegant, very expensive looking outfits. - But... - What? Its a little... You don't like it? It's not that. See this? Now you have to buy it. Ring it up and show her some other outfits. What's expensive here? Ah, well... Thank you. Looking good! Experience really shows. Since you've done this many times... Camera! - Sang-yoon! Get us drinks! - Yes, sir. Now, hold her and draw in your chin. Oh my God!, are you OK?! Mi-yeon Kim's here. Still can't reach Jae-in Hwang? I heard she's here. Hey, if she comes, don't let her in. Don't let her in. Is she some star? Always wanting to make an entrance. - She's here. - I'll escort her. You're a little late. Must've been the traffic. Have a seat at the end. Will you move for her, please? Jae-in! Jae-in Hwang, right? It's me, Sang-yoon. The ace! Your turn, mommy. Huh? You win, Ki-dong. Let's stop playing for today, okay? Sure. What a mother, teaching a kid how to play cards... Don't people ask you about me? No If they do, tell them like we practiced last time. Okay. You sure? You saw my TV commercial. I'm pretty famous. You lose. Double whammy! Pay up! What now? I got to pee. Want me to shuffle, then? Okay. Aim well and flush. Okay. Cut the deck. Stick! Look! Kids shouldn't play this darn game! I quit! You liked taking pictures. Now, you're a photographer? Do you still do that when you take pictures? Do what? I kept it to show you, if we ever met again. But it took so long. You're a great singer. I watched you like a million times. I even cried a little. I entered the contest... Thinking maybe you'd see me on the air... Then maybe we could meet again. -Why didn't you tell me? -Pardon? That Ki-dong can play so well. He played cards here? How can you... Ki-dong? Can you show your uncle? You want us to play it here? Don't do it, Ki-dong! Pretty good. Now that you're going to the director's house for piano lessons. Yeah? Yes Can you find out if she has a boyfriend or not? Act natural without her catching on that I put you up to it. Find out if she's willing to date. If she is, then find out what she thinks about me. Not in the house! Good job, Ki-dong. Let's take a break. Ms. Cho? No boyfriend? Alright! Now, for step two. Let me treat you to dinner. What do you like? Cutlets with black pepper? No sauce? But I hate cutlets. Anything else? Men who play computer games well? Men who play computer games well? You sure? That doesn't match up. I'm going out. Is that a man's voice I hear? I know there are some leftovers. But it's fried fish night. I'm not whining about the food. Aren't you coming home to eat? Forget it! My mother-in-law's over. No, I'm at home. I can't. I'm doing a delivery. It's coming! Hold it! Hold it! I'm at a shoot. Make it exciting! Ready! Action! I can cook and eat well by myself, like I always did. Hello? Dinner? No plans, yet. Shall we? But Ki-dong says he's sleepy. I want to stay with granny. Granny? - My mother. - Go. Cutlets are my favorite! Did you see my commercial? I love putting black pepper on it without the sauce. I love that, too. Really? That's not common. Must be fate. What do you do on the weekends? Want to play a computer game with me? I'm a total fanatic. I almost broke my back playing the other day. I meant I didn't like men who play computer games. You got the wrong message. Since it goes through Ki-dong and all. You could've just asked me. What kind of men are you attracted to? I stopped singing since my second album bombed. Don't worry. I won't sing one of my songs. Grab it, already. You said that the first time we held hands, too. Jae In I should've said this six years ago. I love you with all my heart. Even if I'm different from other girls... I love you I'm so sorry. I'd better go, before I get hit again. Bye! Go on home! Before someone snatches you away. I'll call you! Bye! Why are you out so late? Why? Worried about me? Were you with a man? Don't nag. Where's the new underwear I bought? Just wear mine, who cares? That's why I am! But why is it so big? Is it extra large? Yes, Chief! Don't stay out late! Men keep women out late at night to... Do you even know? What? Tell me. Forget it. Guys want to try something? - Forget it, kid. - I want to know. Shut up! What? Want me to tell you about my first time? What? Are you out of your mind? Then tell me about yours. Have you lost your mind? Come on. What are you singing in the finals? I have no idea. Song three on my first album. - "My Gift"? Right! You know it? It's a hidden classic. We can change it to your key. Show more love! - That's it! - Like this? Stop! Great! Get me some coffee, Sang-yoon. No, stop! Don't! Let's take five. What are you a klutz? Get out of the way! Ouch, my head! What the hell! I don't believe this. What's wrong? Oh, nothing... You know Hyun-soo Nam, the DJ? He's got a pretty bad rep. Really? Don't you surf the Net? He dates young girls and likes to do freaky things. He wears their underwear and... No, he doesn't! Tell me it's not true. You can't be. You're not living with him are you? Right? Right? I'll tell you everything later. You slept with him? You did. I'll get that bastard! Stop it! Don't you dare. You're covering for him? So he won't get hurt? You like him that much for taking you in to live with him? Yeah, I like him! So what! He's going down. Some reporter said he'd ruin him if I gave him the pictures. I'll destroy him! You haven't changed one bit! Get out of our lives for good! Were you that desperate? Did you have to mess with the contestants? Someone sent in a tip. Reporter Bong is already digging around. You've been out cold for three years after your second album. Forget that everything can crumble in a flash in this field? I know, Sir. That girl Jae In...Don't let her sing this time. I'm not the one to fall to a scandal. It's you! I'm using it. We need to talk. Please? It'll be a while. Look. About the singing finals... Are you listening? Go on. I landed some commercials and the show's going great. That's that. But... You... Let's stop here. So you go and win, then what? Tell everyone you're my daughter and a single mom? Then it'll be hard for both of us. I know you won't tell... But if people find out about you, my career's over! You know how hard it was for me to get here after... I got a strange call saying they know about him living with Jae-in Hwang. -I knew something was up between them! -He's here! I warned you! I took you in when you were down and this is the thanks I get? Pack your bags next season! Jae-in. Please, talk to me. I'll be good. I'll be good. Listen to me. I have to save you. I can't let you live in that hellhole. Please, Jae-in! Don't go! Where's Hyun-soo Nam! You bastard! Come out! Go. We'll talk later. Let me take care of you. Please, just go. I could see it in your eyes. Begging me to save you. And help you escape from that house. I'll save you from that freak! Where is he!? You came to ruin me, didn't you? Did your mom put you up to it? To destroy my life for ruining hers? Mom's life was never ruined. Then why are you doing this? You even brought in some loser to help you? Did you promise him a cut? Don't look at me like that! I'm home. Not now. Yes, now! Just pack up and leave! Go ahead and tell the papers and the stations! Just take your kid and get the hell out! Go to your room, Ki-dong. Stay right there! Go in, now! - I'm not leaving. -What? I'm your daughter, dad. I have a right to be here. You want money? Fine, I'll give you money! I told you I'd get you a house. You want a car, too? Fine! Just leave! Get the hell out of my life! You think I came for the money? You came because you can't raise your damn kid by yourself! Didn't you? Then you came looking for me to be your father? Yes! That's why I came! I wanted my father! Everyone else has a dad! Why can't I live with mine? I didn't ask to be born! All I wanted to do was to live quietly and sing! What did I do so wrong! My eyes! My nose! You made me! I'm here, dad! Why don't you want me around? Why? When I'm right here! I never wanted you. Thank you for everything. But... I won't bother you again. Take care. She hasn't called? Nope. So call her. I broke her phone. Aren't you worried? I'm worried about me. Look. It's simple. Just confess it. You're no mega star. You're not that popular. I am, too. You lost your mind! Who's more important? Strangers or your long lost daughter? She's all grown up. You should be thankful! Why's there so much yapping in this dog hospital? Get me another drink. Shove this dog food down your throat instead. Even the dogs are crying because their puppies are gone. Your recorder is all fixed now. Hold on, please. - Give me that. - I'm the one who'll be singing. I'm the original singer. Listen up. Forget it. Imagine singing this on the stage with 50 choir members behind you. Add in strings. It's a classic! More feeling! Then you sing it, dad. Be the DJ, the singer, and everything! Listen when I'm trying to teach you. Two stews to serve! Two more for table three. Here's your stew. Enjoy. Water, please. What? Right away, sir. Miss? More tofu, please. Right away, sir! Wait, we have room. Mind sitting here with them? I'll add in extra side dishes. Sorry. Turn the radio on. Ouch, my back. Being healthy is most important. I hope you both get healthy soon. Thank you for sending in your story. Now for Afternoon Radio's final story for today. It's been a while since we heard from her. It's a letter from the single mom, Jung-nam Hwang. I left my father's house after a big fight. He said some harsh things, he probably didn't mean. He blurted some things in the heat of anger. He's probably regretting it right now. I want to go back to him. But I don't know how to make up and go back. Any ideas? Ms. Hwang? If you're listening... Call your father, now. - A beer, please. - Right away! - Turn the heater on. - Yes, goodnight. Can't we go to grandpa's? You miss him? He's a pretty good guy. That tickles. Let's sleep. So I went to get a waxing job because of him. Then he said my ankles were thick! Look at the monitor! That made me so mad and... Jung-nam Hwang is on the line That made me so mad and... So I went to the hospital, but the doctor said... - Ms. Kim? - Yes? - Just break up with him. - What? Thank you for calling in. Now, we're on line with Jung-nam Hwang. Hello? Jung-nam? Where are you calling from? You're on the air. Hello? You're writing well as usual. Hiding and not calling won't solve the problem. My existence itself is the problem. Who said that? Your father? Jung-nam... Just like you wrote before... Maybe your father made a mistake in an angry moment. It wasn't a mistake. Yes, it was! Do you know my dad? Ah, of course not. He lived his whole life without even knowing I existed. I was wrong to think he'd suddenly welcome me into his life. You cant just walk away like that. That doesn't solve anything. Shouldn't you listen to what your father has to say? Be my guest. For me to be my father's daughter, he has too much to lose. Thank you for airing my stories. Wait! Jung-nam! Music! Now! Jung-nam? If you're still listening, I have just one thing to say. Whether you forgive your father or not. Don't give up on your dreams. You said you wanted to sing. Then do it! Not for anyone else. Not your father or your son. Do it for you! Single mothers have dreams, too. Which light is out, kid? Its me. Get the AD on. - I'm looking. - Which light is out? Don't know, man. Here he is. Don't lose it. Hey So which light is out? The number three backlight. On the left! Where's the exit? That way. No, not there. What are you doing? Stay here for a sec. Number three is out! Should we cancel on Jae-in Hwang's act? We won't have to pay them all if we cancel now. How old is your daughter? Going into kindergarten next year. When will you raise her and get a grandson? Huh? Cancel it. 10 minutes to full rehearsals! Places everyone! -Hey, Lee! -Yeah? Cancel on the cancel. Thank you. Next up is Jae-in Hwang. Take center stage. Lights off, please! Ready! Cue! Was mommy good? Not so bad. Can we go to grandpa's today? You're happy to see him again? Jae-in Hwang? Make-up room, please. Hurry, there's not much time. Mommy will be right back. Wait right here, okay? Wow , we caused a frenzy again! Hello. Hello. You look great. Did anyone see where the boy sitting there went? No, sorry. Wasn't there a man with the kid? Ki-dong Hwang! Ki-dong! Five minutes to show time. Thank you judges. -Sushi afterwards? -Sure! Steak for me. Ki-dong! Help me! -Help me! -Get down! Help me, please. It's Ki-dong! Ki-dong's missing, daddy! Get her down! Get up there! No! Ki-dong! Ki-dong! Ki-dong's missing, daddy! Start! Afternoon Radio with Hyun-soo Nam. Welcome everyone. I thank you all for coming to our singing contest finals. We have some very special guests in our concert today. The contestants you've seen are... We're looking for a lost child. His name is Ki-dong Hwang. Age six. About this tall. He has curly hair. He plays cards well. He's a master pianist and has a sleepwalking problem. Please, if you see him... Take your damn hands off her! Get away from her! Being here won't change anything. Just go home. She your sister? Girlfriend? She's not a girlfriend. Any news? Nothing yet. But they're looking. The police have a good system of finding lost kids these days. Ki-dong is very smart. He'll find his way home. Jae-in! I can't believe you! You even have a son? I'll find your son! And you! If you ever make Jae-in cry again, I'll... He's yours. Ki-dong is our son. He's your son. You're the father! You said he died. Just kill him now! Then who are you? I'm her father! Why you little! You should've stood by her!
