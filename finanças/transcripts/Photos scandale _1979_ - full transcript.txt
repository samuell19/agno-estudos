- What's up? - I broke down. We'll sort you out. SCANDALOUS PHOTOS - What about this one? - Yes, yes! You and your friends are useless. My poor Chris, you can't see further than the end of your nose. I don't understand. We can get up to ten customers in one night. Listen to me Juliette... I don't believe this. Juliette... My poor Chris. You're a wonderful lover but when it comes to using your brain, it's no use. A big hole. I have A-Levels. I'm not that stupid! Quiet. Listen to me carefully. Would you like to be loaded - really loaded? So much money you wouldn't know what to do with it? I'll use your charming assets to get a nice packet. Nowadays, quite a few birds hang around the clubs in Pigalle. Daddy's girls, who feel like being naughty. They're looking for a bit of "rough" - like you. Me, rough? Like a garbage tip. But that's not the point. We're going back to Paris. You'll flirt with the little heiresses. You'll take them to the studio... and there you do your charming little number and I snap. Got it. Photos like that must sell for a good price. But if I fuck them, don't get jealous. When you reach a certain amount, jealousy can disappear. Hold me, Don Juan. Nowadays, quite a few birds hang around the clubs in Pigalle. Daddy's girls who feel like being naughty. They're looking for a bit of "rough" - like you. Is that girl called Jane? Yes, Jane Sauvalos. She's loaded, but she's up for a quickie. She's been laid by everyone here. Give it a shot, try your luck. Why not? - Put some reggae on, I'll dance. - You came here to dance? You naughty boy. - Are you really Jane Sauvalos? - Yes Sir. Is your father the aeroplane man? Yes, I am a wealthy heiress, but don't plan on marrying me, I'm promised to an ambassador. I flirted with you because you're cool, not for your money. - Do you go to cabarets? - Sure, let me show you. You'll see what I mean. Turn off the light. No, I like to see. Close your eyes. What was that? A friend of yours? Goodie, I love that! Calm down, alright? Come here. Enough of that! You can warn your father that we have some compromising photos for him We'll contact him later to state our conditions. You bastards! - Do you want to leave naked? Out! You did well. How did you know she'd be there? My sister Diana gave me a tip-off. Hello, Diana? It's Juliette. I got the photos of Sauvalos. Do you know where the other three are? Only the Malher girl? Okay, take care. I don't get it. Listen and look. That's the Sauvalos girl. Yes, the other three are the heiresses of Sauvalos' biggest associates. Annik Malher, Carla Bartok, Elizabeth Bruckner. The World press says they're all perfect little girls. I'll shake their families up. We'll collect some scandalous photos which are a little debauched. Got it? Excellent. The big shots are going to have to cough up. Exactly. People like to keep these things in the family. Who's next? She is. Annick Malher. Diana told me where we can find her. Where? In Tangiers. We're leaving tomorrow. It's too late to sleep. It's too busy. Let's go to the back, where the jetset hang out. Alright. - The starting price for this dress? - 3,000 - 4,000... 4,500 - 5,000... 5,500 - 6,000... 6,500 - 7,000... 7,500 8,000... going once... twice... gone.

It's your turn now, Chris. Maybe we made her drink too much. I'll get something to sober her up. - You fool. Put that money back! - What's the matter with you? You're such a loser! You'll never get it, will you? We're aiming higher, much higher than a wad of notes. - Do you like the slut? - Yeah. Control yourself. Move. Where am I? What am I doing here? You were drunk. I must have been as pissed as a fart. Funny way to talk for a rich girl. Well, I drink all the time. Anything could happen. I wouldn't remember. Can I have a Scotch? Try to remember. You stripped off and sold your clothes. Amusing. My friend Chris kissed you a few times. I vaguely remember that. Then you'd drunk a lot so we came here. You and I made love. With you? So who cares? I took photos. - Blackmail? - Yes. Amateurs. I am Annick Malher. My father is far too powerful to be scared of you. Juliette, she's having us on. Listen to me, you little fool. If your father and Sauvalos don't pay, you'll be front page news. With Sauvalos? You know about their partnership? Yeah... I know everything. Okay, I've been had. Go and warn your father that Jane Sauvalos is in the same boat as you. You're real shits. Calm down, Chris. She's not entirely wrong. What if I call the police? Go ahead, it will make the scandal bigger. Come on, I'll drive you back. Can you get me a number in Paris. Hello? Mr. Sauvalos, please. It's a personal and delicate matter. Mr. Sauvalos? I have a proposition for you. The time is perfectly suited to this type of deal. Mr. Ravel, I have Mr. Sauvalos on the phone for you. He's furious, he has been looking for you for hours. So? I don't take my orders from him. Alright, let's go. Hello, this is Ravel. Yeah... right. Yes, OK, I'll see you tomorrow morning at 8am. What now? I'm resting right now. What a pain in the ass. A double scotch. No, a triple. Take a seat, Jim. A cigar at this time of the morning? So what? I never sleep. Keep on massaging my sweet. Would you like a massage? It's very good for the shape. No thank you. I'm already in good shape If you're clear-minded, good. Now listen. I'm head of a new company. There are four partners: There's me, Malher, Bartok and Bruckner. I run everything and I answer only to one man, an important man who is close to the President of the United States. But he's a Mormon and is more puritanical than all the Popes put together. I'm with you. Pretty girl, huh? And extremely docile. OK, I'll continue. Help yourself to a drink old chap. This partnership deals with official affairs and unofficial deals. But somebody else must know about this. - Do you know who? - No, and that's where you come in. I'm being blackmailed, and so is Malher. Somebody has taken compromising photos of our daughters. If the papers find out. My empire is finished. All of this seems a little far-fetched. Are you taking the piss? Mr. Ravel, I am Jonathan Sauvalos. I am powerful. I'm worth millions of dollars. Don't confuse me with one of your pathetic small-time customers who come crying into yourjacket with their crappy divorce cases. Where are you going? I detest being shouted at. Neither your money or your shouting impress me. Don't hold it against me Jim. I'm in deep shit. Despite all my power, I'm at the mercy of a mystical Quaker. It happens a lot. Each to their own beliefs. Do you know why Malher, Bartok, Bruckner and I are associates? - Is this a riddle? - No, it is not. It's because all four of us believe in the same thing: Money. Are you going to pay the blackmailers? No, of course not. Paying or calling the police is pointless. Those responsible must have had a tip off. We must be able to trace them. That's your nextjob. Hang on, it's too dangerous. I like being alive. No one refuses to work for Sauvalos. In other words, I have no choice. - How much will you pay me? - One million. What? One million. Ten million if you catch these sharks and get me the negatives and photos. Well, I suppose even if there are risks ...apart from a few barmen expecting my generous tips, I'm not responsible for anybody. Alright. Okay. Good. I reckon they'll try to catch Carla Bartok out next. Elizabeth Bruckner is at a physics and chemistry seminar in London. They can't get to her there. Carla Bartok is on the Côte d'Azur. My private jet will take you there. You'll arrive in Cannes this evening. You will attend a party. Carla Bartok will also attend the party. The blackmailer will probably be there too. Here's an advance and a photo of Carla. I'd recognize her on the tube at rush hour - Only... - Only what? Beauties like her never take the tube. - I need to catch up with that boat. - Why? I'll give you 500 francs. For that price I'll take you anywhere. Are you Carla Bartok? It's not difficult to recognize me. My picture is in all the glossy magazines. I don't read that type of magazine. - Don't you read? - Yes, Paris-Turf. Ah... a player. Not at all. I love horses, but I never gable. It's a waste of pleasure. - Not even if you win? - Even if I win. You're a strange type. Not really. I don't look as sad as you. It's true. I am sad. These people bore me. Gold diggers, nouveaux riches, artists, show-offs... what a mess! Have a look. It's their favourite game. Tomorrow the girls will realise that the pearls are fake. But that their bronchitis is real. They are strong, country girls. What's your name? Ravel, like the musician. And Jim. Like Jungle Jim. - I've had enough, take me home. - I didn't dare offer. - I like men who dare. - I'll remember that. - You're a strange girl. - Yes, I know. I live the "good life." The papers see me engaged to princes or famous artists... You seem like a little girl. I would like to take you in my arms to protect you. You'll think I'm an idiot but I've fallen in love with you. Kiss me. I shouldn't have done that. You know nothing about me and for you it's just another fling. What if I told you I had not had many? What if I'm so in love that I'll accept anything about you? - If I said to you... - Don't say any more. You've had too much champagne. If I listen, I might start believing you. You think I like behaving like this? I don't know. All I know is that I've wanted you ever since I got on that damned boat. Juliette! Don't leave me here! I'll explain everything, Carla. I'm paid by Sauvalos to protect you. But believe it or not before this idiot arrived, I wasn't even thinking of Sauvalos. I was dreaming with you. Now I realise that I was crazy. Drop us off at the police station. I know an inspector there who will make him talk. And if I said it's all OK and that I like you anyway? How long would it last? Three Days? Three weeks? Forget it. Very well, stubborn. I'll take you to the cops. Listen Mr. Sauvalos, I handed him to the cops. He's got a record and is wanted for various offences. He's locked up. All I know is that some girl works with him in Rue Saint-Denis. I'll be there in a few hours. Miss Bartok is out of danger for now, and she's on her guard. - Jim, what are you doing here? - I'm looking for a girl called Olga. Quite a few girls are called Olga. If you think you might find her here, then have a look around. Hi, are you coming in, darling? Is Olga here? Do you have an appointment? Room two. But you're making a mistake. With me, the crossing has its charms Are you Olga? Yes. It's 150 francs 200 if we take our time. - Can I keep the change? - We'll see. - You look like a cop. - Cut the bullshit. Good. A wash? No need. So that's it. A weirdo. - You want another girl? - Is there another Olga? No. No one's missing then. I don't like this. Either you talk, or you and your money leave. Leave alright! Get it? Let's talk about Chris. Do you still see him? No, he dumped me six months ago and took all my savings, a real bastard. If he's your mate, tell him... He's not. He's in prison for blackmail. So you are a cop. Bad luck. I don't know anything else about him. I believe you. See you. Keep the money for my troubles. I don't like earning money like that. - Unless you're being faithful. - Faithful to who? Well? If it doesn't disgust you to make love with a private detective? Here I make love with politicians... - I didn't think the little slut would help. - What else can I do? Keep on dangling the carrot. Jim, let me introduce you to the fourth heiress. Elizabeth Bruckner. She's just returned from London and has agreed to play along with us. From tonight, follow her discretely. - Are you not scared Miss? - It'll make a change. You're right, Sauvalos. Since it's her they want, they'll show their faces. Go. Good luck. Bruckner, Elizabeth Barbara. One more movie and I'll blow your knees off! What did you do to her? A sleeping pill. She'll wake up later. Are you the one who trapped Chris? The pictures. Go to hell! Bastard! Either I beat you till you look like a hunchback, or you talk. Give me a cigarette. Who are your accomplices? I don't have any. The photos are in a safety deposit box at the Gare du Nord. Here's the key. Hello, get me Sauvalos. It's Ravel speaking. Wake him up. Hello... Mr. Sauvalos, it's Jim. I'm at 132 Rue Houdon. Send me two of your men. I have the main blackmailer, and I know where the photos are. First floor, left. You think I'm going to wait for Sauvalos' thugs to come for me? Yes, I do. Because if you try to leave, I'll put a bullet in your neck. So, I have no choice. - I wasn't sure you'd come. - Neither was I. But I'm here. You don't like obeying women. You're your own man. No woman has turned me into her puppet. No woman has made me desperate and unhappy, Carla. Don't you believe in love? Look at those girls in the cabaret. They look innocent. But after closing time, they'll sell to the highest bidder. I don't want to see things the way you do. I brought you here to tell you that I love you and want to marry you. It's weird for a guy like me to be proposed to by 20 million dollars. I don't know if I'm flattered or disgusted. But I'd have to be blind as a bat not to see how pretty you are. - Then let it happen. - No, it wouldn't work. - I could be a good wife. - How awful! I have a dangerous job. I could get small holes in the chest. Bang bang! My offer still stands. Mr. Ravel, Sauvalos wants to see you in the country immediately. Come on, I'll drive you back. Don't hurry! You're useless. You have not solved anything at all. The photos at the Gare du Nord were fakes. Nothing of interest. The real scandalous photos of my daughter and of young Malher's are still in town. It's a timebomb. I need them, do you hear? Juliette has an accomplice. A woman called and threatened to retaliate at midnight if Juliette wasn't freed. It's midnight in two minutes. Then we'll see if it's a bluff. You find that funny? This Juliette Cachon... Yes, Cachon is her name. Why don't you send your guests home? The fools are having fun, so leave them. I find their games sickening. I'm listening. An ultimatum for tomorrow midnight. If Juliette isn't released the photos will be published. - I'll try to find Cross-Eyes. - Who is Cross-Eyes? He's an informer who knows everything. Juliette Cachon. I'll see if he knows her. I'll call you if I have anything new. Juliette Cachon. Ring any bells Cross-Eyes? A former prostitute, Rue Frochat. Petty crimes and blackmail. Not in trouble with the law. Crafty, but not clever. Capable of killing. Uses her body to extract useful information. From my recent information, you recently nailed her. Friends? Parents? A sister, Diana. A call-girl at Madame Clo's. - That's all. - Thanks, Cross-Eyes. Don't forget the contribution, Jim. Yes Mr. Sauvalos, a sister... Diana. She works at Clo's. You'll take care of everything... Fine. How is my dear Clo? You know that I have always protected your political espionage. Do you still employ Diana Cachon? Good. Her sister Juliette tried to blackmail me and I strongly suspect Diana... What? You already knew? You were going to call me. She's a double agent on your premises. The little bitch! I'm like you, I hate double agents. Do you want me to take care of this? You'll do it yourself. Fine. Oh, I almost forgot. I'm sending you an embassy attaché. Very interesting and very talkative. No, don't thank me. It's natural that I should help. That's enough. The economy of a country is not everything. The young and old must be protected from violence and debauchery. Every year I give millions to charity. This type of action is more effective than political slogans. Some degenerates attempt to paint a poor picture of our youth. What mockery, when the enthusiasm of our youth allows our country to move forward. And these despicable men who spit on our institutions. I am proud of my daughter. I am 29 years old and believe that life is beautiful for those who know how to live healthily. What do you think of marriage? It's the most beautiful thing in the world. It's a very serious matter. I can't wait to get married and have children. I'm working hard to make my husband fulfilled and proud of his wife. In order to gain his genuine trust, I refuse to get engaged to anyone. I will marry as a virgin. It's the best present I can give to a man, don't you think? Undoubtedly... but as a wealthy heiress, what do you think of poverty? I think that children are dying of hunger in the world. Instead of helping them, Europeans deny all without thinking. They should be ashamed. We must help the niggers... coloured people. Having lost the colonies doesn't mean that we should lose interest. I belong to a committee for the protection of youth. Drugs, alcohol and debauchery lead to a lack of religion in the young. With this committee we aim to bring youth back to the Lord. I know I'm in no position to talk as I'm a rich heiress as they say. For, life is simple. Being rich does not mean being idle. I study a difficult subject, which demands a lot of work. I know that when students are hungry they work part time. These I will help provided they are of irreproachable character. I hate the hysterical gold-diggers that hang around looking for a rich husband. That's prostitution, not love! Naturally, because of my social status I frequent fashionable circles. I know I'm beautiful and desirable, but life is modest. I make my own breakfast, I talk to taxi drivers I even go shopping in large stores. Has money changed you? No, I've always had money. But I know there is misery in the world and I sympathise with the problems of our times. What do you think of marriage? It's a big adventure, provided you are ready for it. - Miss Diana? - In person. Very nice. Very pretty. Very very pretty. Madame Clo sent me. Yes, come in. - Would you like a drink? - Some camomile. That I don't have. Then a mineral water. Not too cold. Do you like me? - Do you like me? Yes. Oh yes! Could you put this on. Perfect... perfect. Walk in front of me, little girl. Just walk in front of me. How old are you, my little one? I'm fifteen Sir and I go to the Sister's School Blanche de Castille. Very good. And you, what do you do? A diplomat. The lollipop, the lollipop in the left pocket. Not like that! Continue little one, continue. Can I get changed? Yes... yes. - You're a diplomat? - Yes. What do you think about all these weapons stories? I can't tell you, it's a secret. What are the plans of Interpol regarding the arms dealers? Tell me, I demand it. They've spotted a consignment out in the Black Sea. The international situation between the major states prevents it being apprehended. These traffickers have friends everywhere. An informer has promised us some information from Hong Kong. The heads of the traffickers have nothing to fear from either the West or East. They work in close collaboration with all governments. Who is the head of the Indian Ocean expedition? I don't know. Do you know anything else? No, nothing else. - What's going on? Where am I? You fainted. Are you feeling better? Yes thank you. I have to go. When you feel like coming back, just call Madame Clo. I shall do that. Hello... I have news for you. Madame Clo does not suspect anything. I'm waiting for you... hurry. - Who is it? - It's Bill. Come in. You took your time. I fell asleep. - What time is it? - I don't know. Why didn't you come straight over? I went to get the orders. Have you got the money? Of course. Then give me it. The documents first. Here. Is that all? No, I had a diplomat sent by Madame Clo. He told me interesting things about the Black Sea and Hong Kong. Really? What else did he say? That your bosses were protected high up. - Does Clo know about this? - Are you mad? I kept this information for you. I don't think you're giving us all the information that you have. What do you mean? Nothing... And the money? I'm going to pay you right now. But I don't understand... This is where you stop your double game. You've told us a lot of interesting things these last weeks. But since you know too much and tell us too little this is the end of your career. You would kill a girl that you desire? It's my job. There are bad moments. I also want you too. Stop the charade. We can make love. If you want to kill me afterwards what's to stop you? Hello, Madame Clo. I woke you up because I've had a little bit of trouble. I had a very bad visit. No, there was no problem with the client. No, it's something else. There's a stranger here. Completely still. You understand? You're coming? Good. The pig, he doesn't even have any money. Hello, it's Clo. There's a parcel for you at Diana's, second on the left. - We're coming. - Good. A narrow escape, wasn't it. It's dealt with. They're going to get rid of him. - Who was it? - No idea. I don't know him. Ok... It's all there. Perfect. Get dressed, I'll take you away. Where? You need rest, this must have shaken you up. Yes, that's true. And my diplomat? Anything of interest to report? Nothing at all. He's a pervert who likes to look at women in a schoolgirl's uniform. A loser in other words. Diana... you should neverjudge a client. Yes, Madam. I've always trusted you. Thank you, Madam. Are you sure the diplomat didn't say anything important? Yes, Yes. Nothing at all. Let's make sure. What is it? A small device which starts up when triggered by the sound of a voice. And that I had planted in your living room. I'm sending you an interesting client right away. In how long? In an hour. An hour is OK... goodbye. Don't try and leave Diana. Let's listen on a bit further. - Miss Diana? - In person. Very nice. Very pretty. Very very pretty. Madame Clo sent me. Yes, come in. Perfect... perfect. Walk in front of me, little girl. Just walk in front of me... What are the plans of Interpol regarding the arms dealers? Tell me, I demand it. They've spotted a consignment out in the Black Sea. The international situation between the major states prevents it being apprehended. These traffickers have friends everywhere. An informer has promised us some information from Hong Kong. So he didn't say anything then? I... Don't move little one. - Let's see what's on later. - The heads of the traffickers have nothing to fear Have you got the money? Of course. Then give me it. The documents first. Here. Is that all? No, I had a diplomat sent by Madame Clo. He told me interesting things about the Black Sea and Hong Kong. Really? What else did he say? That your bosses were protected high up. - Does Clo know about this? - Are you mad? I kept this information for you. I don't think you're giving us all the information that you have. What do you mean? Nothing... And the money? I'm going to pay you right now. But I don't understand... This is where you stop your double game. You've told us a lot of interesting things these last weeks. You would kill a girl that you desire? - Carla? - I'm stubborn, eh? Come in. The case is over for me. And with you here, another one begins. Yes dear Clo, they were the right photos and negatives. I had them destroyed. Our little girls are safe. No more danger. No scandalous photos! These photos are naughty! I'm ashamed. We're getting married, it's allowed. A kiss, Mrs Ravel? Subtitles by Marc Morris © 2009 Nucleus Films Ltd
