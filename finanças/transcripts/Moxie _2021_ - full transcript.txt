Unless someone was spying on us playing Mario Kart in your mom's basement. I might get ranked "Best Power Slide on Rainbow Road." - Should we have gone to a pool? - It doesn't matter. Emma Cunningham's gonna get ranked "Most Bangable" for the second year. It's not like she's been in a horrific car accident or anything. - [excited chatter] - Oh, great. No, please, block the sidewalk to admire her nails. - Hi. - There we go. That wasn't so hard, was it? No, it was not. Did you hear she and Mitchell Wilson broke up? I heard he broke up with her. - It's so nice not to be on anyone's radar. - Totally. [song ends] It's gonna be Kiera Pascal for "Best Ass" again. For sure. [Vivian] Not fair. She's captain of the soccer team. Do they know how much running and jumping she's doing? [Claudia] Kaitlynn Price has mastered the art of the hot selfie and will probably take "Best Rack" from Olivia Day-Young. [groans] God. How many more days of school do we have left? Eyes on the prize, my dear. Just two more years and we will be safely tucked away in a lab at Berkeley. What prompt will you do for the essay? - Because those questions are stressful. - I'm doing the service one. I'm talking about how much I've grown from volunteering at the VFW, blah, blah, blah. - Do you have Mr. Davies for English? - Uh-huh. Beware. He calls on anyone who sits in the front row. What would I do without you? I guess we'll never find out. [school bell rings] [indistinct chatter] - You can put your valued things. - Thanks. Did you miss me? - Seriously? - Where you going? - Stop. - I got a seat right here for you. Okay, let's wrap up the conversations. Stop talking, please. Unless one of you young people fixed global warming, your summer vacations were boring. Whoa, Mike, you're not starting class without me? - Wow, what a treat. Mr. Wilson's here. - Sorry. I was helping this new freshman girl find her way to class and… she was lost. Chivalry might not be dead, but you will be if you're late to class again. Sit down. So, I shouldn't help people? [Mr. Davies sighs] - That's the message I'm getting, Mike. - I missed you. I missed you more. [Mr. Davies] So, the definition of insanity… Can I help you? I don't know. Can you? [Mr. Davies] Yet here I am with all of you. - Okay, we are going to begin… - Hey. Can you help me, too? What? …with morning announcements. Chris, grab those lights. - [fanfare plays] - [student on TV] Ahoy, Rockport Pirates. Student Body President Bradley Chambers here, along with "argh" lovely Vice President, Emma Cunningham. Good morning, Rockport. Happy to be spreading the Pirate cheer for another year. [Bradley] That's pretty good… Hey, Vivian. How was your summer? Seth? [Emma] Unless you're staying after school for an extracurricular. Speaking of, this year's musical will be Little Shop of Horrors. - [Bradley] Little Shop of Argh-ors… - You look different. [whispers] Your hair. [Emma] Get your Band-Aids ready and sign up for auditions. Argh-ditions. [whispers] Stand up. - What? - Stand up. - Stand up. - Okay. Oh, yep. See? Grew like three inches this summer. - Wow. - Kinda hurts, though. Growing pains. My knees... Quiet. Or you're gonna miss the thrilling conclusion. [Bradley] I'm excited to see our Pirates out on the field and blow the man down. And as athletics get underway, remember to cast your nominations for Student Athlete Ambassador. The winner will receive a $10,000 scholarship, and represent Rockport at the state caucus in the spring. Shiver me timbers. That's a lot of booty. [chuckles] That's it. [sighs] That was pretty great. Who did the summer reading that I asked everyone to do? You are new. You are Lucy Hernandez. Welcome. Well, Lucy, since you did the summer reading, I'll ask you the first question we apparently have to ask about every work of art now, no matter what it's about or what time period it was created. How are women portrayed? Well, I think the real question is, why are we still reading this book? It's written by some rich white guy about some rich white guy, and I guess we're supposed to feel bad for him because he's obsessed with the only girl he can't have? If the point is to learn about the American dream, we should be reading about immigrants, or the working class, or Black mothers, or at least someone who doesn't have a mansion. - Why aren't we reading Sandra Cisneros... - I thought it was great. Hey, I was talking. Yeah, I know, but The Great Gatsby is a classic. Just because other books are good doesn't mean this is less good. I didn't say it wasn't good. - I just wish that... - You're not listening to me. People have read and have loved The Great Gatsby forever. There must be something that makes it so we read it every year at our own school. Spoken like a true Nick Carraway. Do you know who Nick Carraway is? He was played by Tobey Maguire in the movie. Okay, first day of school. I know everything is lame and boring, but tell me one thing. I don't know, Mom. I had math. What did you learn today? What kind of person were you? What made you smile? What were your biggest challenges? This conversation? You know, you used to be a little person who did what I said. - I don't remember any of that. - Hm. Lisa. Hey, John. How are you? Good. Just getting some chives. Quick chive run. [chuckles] Those are leeks, actually. Oh… - Well, then I picked these for you. - Oh. Thank you. - Nice to see you. - You too. Ew. That man was flirting with you. He was? Really? Huh. Well, one thing happened today. There was this new girl and she started getting into it with Mitchell. Sometimes I think about the fact that Mitchell Wilson is going to breed and his offspring will be tall, handsome assholes and it makes me very sad. You're so dramatic, Mom. Okay, Mitchell is fine, all right? It's all good. Mom, milk is bad. People aren't supposed to drink it anymore. Whose child are you? You can't take my milk away. - Hey girls. Let me help you out here. - That's okay. We got it. Okay, just make sure to put the eggs on top. So, I shouldn't open the carton and dump them in there? - Okay. - I'm gonna go wait in the car. Just trying to help. I know how to pack my own suitcase. I can pack my own grocery bag. Yeah, I remember you.

[Claudia] Oh, my God. You want to bang Seth the Shrimp. - Sure hope my first time isn't banging. - [Claudia gasps] You love him. You want to have 15 of his babies. Whoa. You're right. Seth the Shrimp's gonna need a new nickname. Hey. Can I buy you a drink? - [Lucy] No, thanks. I got it. - [Mitchell] Oh, come on. I think we got off on the wrong foot earlier. Don't touch me. No need to freak out. I'm not freaking out. I didn't say that you could touch me. Okay? [sighs] Why do you always have to be so difficult? I'm literally just trying to buy a soda. You're the one having this meltdown. [thud] That's mine. Oh, is it? [hacks] Welcome to Rockport. [Lucy] Mitchell Wilson is harassing me. I don't feel safe. - Mitchell? - Yes. - Wilson? - Yeah. - Captain of the football team? - Yes. He's bothering you. - He's harassing me. - Oh. There's that word. If you use that word, that means I have to do a bunch of stuff, but if he's bothering you, and that's what it sounds like to me, then we can actually have a conversation. Lucy, I am aware that outside these walls the world is experiencing a tornado, and that, in response, young people, especially girls, are expressing their discontent about everything in every direction. But we have to be clear about things before we move forward. - Okay. I just... - Look, look, look. I step in when we find drugs in school or when someone threatens on YouTube to bring in a weapon. This feels like something that we can solve together. It's your first week of school, in a new school. [chuckles] That can be emotional. Mm-hm. It says here on your transcript that you play music. I think you would make a great addition to the marching band. Think about it. All those cute little outfits and you can blow all those big emotions into the saxophone or the piccolo. Whatever feels right to you. Gigi, let's sign her up for the marching band. Great. [door closes] [Vivian] Hey, Lucy. Uh, we have English class together. I'm... Vivian, right? You sit in the back. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Look, I just wanted to say ignore Mitchell. Why should I have to ignore him? Why can't he just not be a dick? [laughs] He's an idiot. He has been since the second grade. He's dangerous. I don't think he's dangerous. I think he's just annoying. You know that annoying can be more than just annoying, right? Like, it can be code for worse stuff. If you keep your head down, he'll move on and bother somebody else. Thanks for the advice, but I'm gonna keep my head up, high. See you in class. [Lisa sighs] Traffic was horrible. I let three people merge and not one wave. It's a heartless town we live in. [Vivian] Want some salad? [Lisa] No. Then why did we buy, like, 12 cucumbers at the farmers' market? [Lisa] Because. We have to support the farmers. [Lisa sighs] Ah! Thank you. - Long day? - Yeah. There were so many DUIs and UTIs, I think I might have screwed some up. Hey, Mom, what do 16-year-olds care about? [Lisa] Oh, I don't know. When I was 16, all I cared about was smashing the patriarchy and burning it all down. Well, I can't put that on my application. [reporter on TV] Allegations arise as more women come forward. Protests continued in multiple states and were pushed back… You know how you're always telling me to keep my head up high. It's from a song you used to play when I was little? Yeah. "Rebel Girl." Bikini Kill. Why? Uh, history project. Oh, God. Makes me feel old. Sorry I asked.

[Kiera] Look at this. - Imagine if they actually won a game. - [Amaya] True! Did you hear my girl? If pep rallies were for teams who actually won games, they'd be doing soccer cheers. Maybe the bake sale could buy us new uniforms. They would be baking some cookies and cakes and pies for us. [excited chatter] Hello. [band stops playing] [crowd cheering] Woo! Woo! All right. Love that. Those girls got moxie. [cheering] In fact, this entire school's got moxie, am I right? Let me hear it! [cheering] Moxie? What is she, like, 100 years old? All right, let's save some of that energy to welcome your team captain, Mitchell Wilson and the Rockport Pirates.

So, I was up, like, all night last night thinking of some words that represent this year… [gasps] Viv. They posted the list. You know that list is pretty messed up if you think about it. Yeah, duh. [murmuring] Thank you, Bradley. That was so amazing. Thank you! Obvs, Emma got Most Bangable. Boring. No, I mean, like, really messed up. [murmuring] Oh, man. I called it. Kiera got Best Ass again. Did we bet on that? - I can't remember. - Why have we all accepted it? Like, no one even blinks. [Claudia] You're on here. - Oh. - [Claudia] It's not that bad. [Claudia] Oh, shit. They added a new category. Wow, that's a lot. [crowd whispering] [Vivian] Think we should say something to her? I don't want to have to say the c-word out loud. Have you seen this? - What is it, honey? - [cheerleaders cheering] See what they called me? Oh. No, that's social media. - I don't understand. - No, it's a list. Well, listen, Lucy. Sticks and stones. Are you kidding me? Go and sit down. We're having a pep rally. [crowd cheers] [marching band strikes up] [Claudia] Where are you going? Uh… I… I don't feel well. - What time should I pick you up tonight? - I'm not going. Boo! - [Vivian] Jesus. - [laughing] - Uh-oh. We're in trouble. - Her? She's not gonna do anything.

Hey, can I sit with you guys? Yeah, sure. [Lucy] Oh, and thanks for giving me this. I needed a sign from the universe that there were actual humans here. - [Vivian chuckles] - What is that? Um… I don't know. I found it in the girls' bathroom. It's a zine. In the Bay Area, there are tons of them at shows, but it's the first time that I've seen one here. Sorry we are not the Bay Area. So are you guys gonna do the thing that it says for tomorrow? It says to draw hearts and stars on your hands to show support. Yeah, I was gonna do it. Yeah, me too.

Just a quick update on my injury. It was a green break, and it, like, didn't… It didn't even hurt at all. So, I shall be ready to cheer again on the SS football field come Friday. Hey. So Bradley Chambers's parents are going out of town, I think to Mongolia or something, but he's gonna have a party, which is cool. It's Hawaiian-themed though, which isn't that cool, but are you gonna go? Yeah.Yeah. [Bradley] Appearing in a sailor's tale, there's been some unrest on my ship… Oh. Excuse me, Mr. Davies.

Oh, girl, you bad. You're going to jail. You in trouble. That's what you get for trying to dress like Britney Spears. - Shut up. - [Mr. Davies] Yeah. - You're wearing the same thing. - You're right. I need to go with her, so we can talk about that. We need to stick together. I'll... - Sit down. - [scoffs] Mitchell, you want to laugh? Laugh at the announcements. [Emma on TV] The winner will receive a $10,000 scholarship and represent Rockport at the state caucus in the spring. [Vivian] Another girl had the exact same tank top on. They were wearing the same thing, but she got in trouble because she looks a little different than that other girl. - [Lisa] Oh. - She had... - [Lisa] Okay, I get it. - Yeah. Shelly was like, "You gotta put on a sweater." She's like, "I don't have one." And so then Shelly said, "Come with me," and she sent her home. Isn't that crazy? Wow. I am so glad we didn't have a dress code. Me and my friends were such assholes, we protested everything. One time someone told our friend Sarah that she smelled, and none of us showered for two weeks. - [laughing] - Yeah. But how do you know what to do? Like, how to protest something? We didn't. You know, we made a ton of mistakes. We argued with each other. We weren't intersectional enough. We called our meetings powwows. - [laughing] Oh no. - Mm-hm. But you're glad you did it all? Of course. What are you gonna do? Nothing? You sound like Lucy. Oh. That's that new girl, right? You like her. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we're so different. Sometimes you meet someone different and you just kind of click. Like that guy John that we saw at the supermarket. I don't know. We don't really agree on things, but we've been cracking each other up at work. Yeah. Lucy is fine. She's great. It's Claudia that's being weird. Wait, you're having problems with Claudia? Don't stress me out. You're supposed to be best friends with Claudia for life. Do you remember when you guys used to sing the song from Wicked? - Do you still do that? - [laughs] No. - Oh, no. - No, Mom, we're fine. Okay? - We're going to a party later. Relax. - Don't tell me to relax. That's very triggering for me. - [excited chatter] - [Claudia] This looks like the place. [music playing] My mom had this in the fridge. Oh, good. I feel like I would love white wine. - Wait, should I have brought something? - [guy 1] You got this. [groans] [laughter] Oh… There's a lot of people here. A lot of party people. I'm not sure we're party people. Did you bring a corkscrew? No. Maybe they have one inside. [yells] Beer is my best friend! ["Surf" by Ka'au Crater Boys playing] [Bradley] All right. Welcome, guys, welcome. This is a totally safe party space, all right? Just do whatever. There's tons of alcohol in the kitchen. Tons. My cousin's 29, so it's, like, not a big deal at all. Just go crazy, as long as everybody gets lei-d. Hawaii. - [clears throat] - Um… - Here, I brought this for you. - Oh, awesome. Very adult. Wine. This doesn't feel culturally sensitive. I don't know. Could be fun. Disco cat. Maybe we should find a quiet corner. Let the party come to us. - Woo! - [laughter] Maybe not here. It could be more chill outside. Better for conversation. Yes. More low-key. Maybe this is a little bit too low-key. Does that make sense? [yelling] - [thud] - [laughter] How do you know if you're having fun? I think I'm having fun. I think you know it when you feel it. Yeah, totally. I'm having fun if you're having fun. Yeah, I am if you are. [girls] Woo! [Mitchell] No, no, no. No. Your elbows were halfway across the table. How about this. You two, get out of here. You two, get in. [girls] Hater! No wonder Emma Cunningham dates a college guy. There's no way she'd come to a party like this. Yeah, college parties are probably a bit more composed. [chuckles] [Amaya] Check her. Yeah, she's got the hearts and stars. Oh, I'm allergic to Sharpie. - Come on. We want to talk to you guys. - You heard the lady. Follow me. Where are we going? I don't know. [Hawaiian music playing] Hey. [door closes] All right, what's up, guys? I just took a lap around. Safe to say this party is officially bumping. All right, just have fun, as long as everybody gets lei-d. Good. You found 'em. What the hell is this room? - [door closes] - [Kiera] I think it's a man cave. Yeah, I feel harassed just by being in here. Amaya, lock the door. Mm. [Kiera] Okay, so… Who's Moxie? Yeah, who wrote it? We want the who, what, where, and why. - I found it in the bathroom. - I saw someone reading it in trig. So, no one knows what Moxie wants or what their plan is? My girl needs a plan. She does not join freaky cults. I don't know if it's a cult. Yeah, I think that they want our school to be safe and fair. You know what's not fair? Our team went to state finals and our uniforms suck. [Kaitlynn] You know what's messed up? I got sent home for wearing a tank top. Meanwhile, Jason is constantly shirtless. You know what's really messed up? People refuse to call me by my new name. Even teachers? [CJ] Yeah, sometimes. And I want to audition for Little Shop of Horrors as Audrey, and everyone's freaking out about it. I would crush "Suddenly Seymour." You know what's also messed up? I don't like being voted Best Ass. You don't like it? Why? Historically, Black women have been judged by their asses and hair, and we are done with that. - Period. - [Kaitlynn] Know what I just realized? The king is worth more than the queen. Why? The queen is the best. Okay, the queen can have children. Look at this king. He looks like an asshole. Guys, I'm just glad we're talking about this. You know that your school is weird? Oh, it's always been weird. We used to have a guy who pulled everyone's pants down. Now, he's a police officer. Okay, but who wrote Moxie for real? Come on. Whoever wrote Moxie is a badass. Definitely someone, like, in their 20s for sure. - I feel like they have tattoos. - I think whoever did it knows the school. Who do you think did it, Vivian? I don't know. I… I just found it and picked it up like everybody else. But I'm really glad I did, because now we're here.

I mean, only because secret identities are objectively rad. Maybe you can give me some. I could put them in the boys' bathroom. [chuckles] Look, I know you're friends with Mitchell. I'm not… friends with him. I've just known him since second grade is all. I know he can be annoying. He's more than annoying. I understand. Here, I don't want to mess with your plans or anything. Totally get it if they're just for the girls. I just thought the boys could use all the help they could get. No, it's okay. You take it. Thanks. I don't wanna keep you from your mission… I got here early so I could retake a physics test for the second time. [chuckles] - So. - Yeah, okay. I guess I'll see you in class. All right. Hey, Vivian. Is it weird that I'm not surprised? Back in kindergarten, you always wanted to take the spiders outside when everyone else wanted to smash them. You remember that? [chuckles] No. I do. [up-tempo electronic music playing] ♪ Oh, I love it ♪ [Kaitlynn] Oh, my gosh. It's about me. Listen to this. "Hey, Moxie girls, have you had enough of these ridiculous, sexist dress code checks?" Literally me. "They're arbitrary and focus overwhelmingly on girls over boys." - That's true. Double standard. - Quadruple standard. "Operating on the idea that girls are responsible for boys' behavior." - My body is my body. - And it is a temple. "In protest of this outdated archaic set of rules…" "On Thursday, come to school in a tank top"? But Kaitlynn got sent home for that. The only time I've been sent home was when I barfed during my Eleanor Roosevelt presentation. I don't even know if I own a tank top. I might have bought one as a Mean Girls Halloween costume, but I chickened out and went as a ghost. Better put on your goggles. This is gonna get nuts. [liquid bubbling] I wanna find a tank top in some dope animal print. To remind the school we've got claws and we're not afraid to use them. Will your parents care if we get in trouble? Will my parents care if I show my shoulders at school? Nah. I mean, your mom won't care, right? Well, I'm not sure. I don't think so. She sort of did a lot of protesting when she was younger. Really? That's fire. Yeah, I was thinking actually more about Claudia's mom. She's pretty intense. Yeah. What's Claudia's deal? You guys are really different. Really? We're both INTJs on the Myers-Briggs test. It's a personality test. We're both introverts. The first time I slept over, we took the test and made T-shirts that said, [laughing] "Don't talk to me, I'm an INTJ." [chuckles] Yeah, Claudia's basically my family. We do everything together. I know one person that will be very happy to see you in a tank top. Hands? The dude who did the hearts and stars all over his hands. Oh, Seth. Yes. What kind of woman am I? [laughs] A… professional ball buster who doesn't take no for an answer. - Okay, I like it. - [laughs] Okay. Now me. Now me.

I also have no complaints. Not no complaints. I have no comment because this seems like a women's issue, and I'm going to respectfully just stay out of it. [Kaitlynn] Seriously? Gosh, that's so convenient for you. You get to say this is "a women's issue," so you don't ever actually have to do anything. Right. Mm-hm. That's fair. Uh… I could do more.

Hey, how'd it go? Girl, it was great. We won, as always. The crowd of 15 moms went wild. [chuckling] - Hey. - Hey. Hello, Rockport! [crowd applauding, cheering] Before we begin the game, I'm going to announce the nominees for Student Athlete Ambassador. This is a prestigious honor bestowed annually on one athlete by the votes of their peers. The winner will receive a national scholarship from Big Five Sporting Goods, the only place to get all your sporting good needs. So just, you know, thank you again to Dave Rogers, former Rockport quarterback, for your generous contributions to our athletic program. And Dave would like me to remind you that he rushed over 100 yards in a game back in 1972. - You just rushed 100 yards an hour ago. - Mm-hm. And now, the first and only nominee for the student athlete award, running uncontested is… The suspense is killing me. …the captain of our Rockport High football team, Mitchell Wilson. - [crowd cheers] - [band strikes up] Okay. [applause dies down] Hey! I have a nomination! Excuse me? I nominate Kiera Pascal, the captain of the girls' soccer team. [cheering] What? What is happening? I'm afraid that you need five votes to support a nomination. I second Kiera! - I'm trying to eat. I ran for an hour. - Shh. And I third and fourth and fifth! That is a spirited but inaccurate demonstration… - I third! - …of democracy. Again, there was a ballot box in the multipurpose room. Fourth! - [whispers] Vivian. No. - [chuckles] Fifth! [Principal Shelly scoffs] Okay. Sure. Two fine nominees. Let's give Kiera a hand. Come on, stand up. Yeah. [cheering] [Principal Shelly] Good luck to both of you! What did you just do? Do you like money? 'Cause I'm finna get you some. [laughing] - Shut up and secure the bag. - I can handle that, sis. [cheering] All right! Let's go, Rockport! Come on! Just a quick reminder, guys.

This group has spread propaganda and has defamed my character. In short, Moxie's bullied me. Oh, my God, he really is scared. We got to him. But the worst part is… that we don't know who Moxie is.

I mean, you try and you try and you try, and nothing actually happens, and nothing works. So, you know what, Mom? You don't know anything about my life, and I clearly do not know anything about your life, so I think I should do my thing and you do your thing. Welcome to the family, John.

I'm the winning asshole. Are you serious? You know what? You are an asshole and you don't get to touch these, okay? If you keep doing that you're gonna hurt my feelings. Mitchell, take the stickers off and get to class. Vivian, come with me. You're in trouble. [Principal Shelly] Where did you get these stickers? - They were in the bathroom. - [Principal Shelly huffs] This is serious. People have defaced school property and someone will get suspended for it. Apparently, Mitchell Wilson isn't the only one that Moxie doesn't like. "Principal Shelly has made it clear she has no interest in supporting the female population of this school and unfairly gave Mitchell Wilson the morning announcement for his hate speech." Hate speech? Wow. Why did you let Mitchell give a speech on the morning announcements? He got it because he asked for it. If anyone from Moxie asked for it, they'd have gotten it, too. How were we supposed to know we were supposed to ask for it? If you want a seat at the table, pull up a chair. Listen, Vivian, I think all of this is wonderful, but it has to stay within the confines of the rules of the school. Do you like him? Mitchell? The girls of the school would love to know what you think. Well, I'm a girl at the school, and I would love to know who started Moxie. Do you have any idea? No. [knocking] Someone put stickers on your car. The asshole stickers? Is this something for the fire department? God, Gigi, no. - Cover it up. Quiet. - [Gigi] Janitor? [Principal Shelly] Yes, get the janitor. [Gigi] Okay. [knocking] [door opens] Hey, are we still mad at each other? You don't need to apologize. It's okay. I thought you were going to apologize to me. What? Why would I apologize to you? Okay. Okay, so if you're going to be an asshole teenager now, this is how we're gonna do it. Because you came home drunk, you have to have dinner with me and John tomorrow night. - Is this punishment? - Yes. It's one of those horrible punishments where you have to have dinner with your mother and the first guy she's been excited about in a long time. Only if Seth comes. And I can't guarantee I won't throw up again. I'll let everyone know. [Lucy] But it means she's scared. It means we're doing things here. Honestly, we're making waves, okay? [Amaya] We are! What's going on? Claudia got suspended for Moxie. What…? What do you mean? Yeah, it's pretty awesome. She took one for the team. - That's not awesome. - [Lucy] She's gonna be fine. She'll write about it on a college application, and people will freak. - She'll be fine. - Don't tell me about Claudia. She's been my best friend my whole life, and you only just got here. Okay. Wow. [doorbell chimes] No. [knocking] Front door didn't go so great, huh? I'd call it a bust. Yeah. My mom would literally prefer I die of contracting bacterial meningitis than get suspended from school. Disease is at least an honorable death. This is gonna screw everything up for you. I don't know. Shelly's blaming me because I put my name down for Moxie. I can't believe you did that. [softly] Yeah. She kept asking me who the leader was, and I said I didn't know. Is there anything you wanna say? How did you know? We've been best friends since we were four. You think you could lead a revolt and I wouldn't notice? Why didn't you tell me? At first, you were being so shitty about it. Yeah, because I knew it was a bad idea, and look. It was. - I didn't ask you to get involved. - Yes, you did. You made me feel bad because I wasn't doing enough. And you don't get it, Viv. You don't get what's going on with me because you're white. Wh-What? Do you know what my mom sacrificed to get to this country? What she had to do to make it so that I could go to college? I am under an insane amount of pressure. I don't have the freedom to take the risks that you do. - Claudia, I'm sorry. - I gotta go. My mom is making me deep clean the rugs to atone for my sins. If you knew it was me, why didn't you tell her? Because I'm not a coward, unlike you. [Claudia sniffs] Oh, right. This whole thing. [Lisa] We have so many breadsticks. [John and Lisa chuckle] [John] Oh, are those the ones I gave you? I got fresh ones just for you. - [chuckling] - What is that voice? It's my voice. No, it's not. [Lisa sighs deeply] So, what's new in teen life these days? Not much, man. Um… Physics is really crushing me. - [laughing] Oh, physics took me out. - Yeah. You guys have so much in common. Maybe you should share a high-five. Um, do they still teach you those, um, mnemonic devices to help you remember all the laws? - If they do, it's not working. - [laughs] It was like for thermodynamics, "Something something never really tire." PV equals NRT. Pure virgins... [sighs] It was a different time. Why is nobody asking me about physics? Do you think because I'm a girl I don't know about science? Not at all. You want to talk about physics? You made a salad? With green things in it? Yes, that's the colors that are traditionally found in a salad. This isn't normal. She usually lives off frozen pizza and ice cream. Well, with our hours, it's hard to find time to make dinner. That's okay. I love to cook. Why do you have an American flag on your car? Do you love America? Do you think it's perfect? Do you know it's gonna take 300 years to reach gender equality in the US? I don't love that part. If you don't love that part, what are you doing about it? Hey, Viv. [scoffs] Okay. What? What? You want me to calm down? You want me to be nice? Like you? And make sure everybody's comfortable? Be your cute little girlfriend with a little ponytail. Well, forget hearts and stars on my hand. Why don't I just write your name on my arm and tell everybody that I'm your property or something? - Vivian. - Fuck the patriarchy! [John sighs] What's going on? I'm not like you. I don't want you to be like me. I want you to be like you. I hate that. That's the suckiest thing you can say to someone. Just be you. Just be yourself. I mean, that is such bullshit mom talk. Okay. Okay. What do you want me to say? Can you just leave? No, this is my house. I get to stand wherever I want. Oh, right. Yeah, I forgot. You're a rebel girl, and no one tells you what to do unless it's some lame dork who flirts with you once in a grocery store. Hey, you can't talk to me like that. I'm your mother and I'm also a person, and I get lonely, and it's nice when someone likes me. Okay, fine, then just go enjoy your spring salad while I sit here with my entire life falling apart. What is falling apart? Nothing. Just Claudia won't talk to me, I might get kicked out of school, and I might have sex. Wait, you might get kicked out? You don't care that I might have sex? Vivian, slow down. Shelly said anybody associated with Moxie is gonna get kicked out. Claudia already was. What is Moxie? It's a feminist club I started. - You started a feminist club? - Yeah, and it's all your fault. I only started Moxie because you made me believe I was strong or something, but I'm not that kind of person. None of it is working, and no one is helping me, and I am all alone in this. Why isn't Dad spending Christmas with me, Mom? [sniffs] Oh, honey. [sobbing] Please just go away. I just want to be alone. Okay? For sure. He's the victim of revenge for a crime he didn't commit. [distant] There's no evidence, no proof. There's nothing. - How could you not feel bad for him? - [Mr. Davies] He's a gangster. [Mitchell] Yeah, but Mike, at the core, he's a romantic. And this is what they do to him? I just can't take that Fitzgerald leaves it so ambiguous at the end. Is he good? Is he bad? I don't know. He wants you to ask that question. He wants you to look upon yourself and your morality. Do you empathize with Gatsby… [school bell rings] [indistinct chatter] Hey. Hey, are you mad at me? You mean for yelling at me at the table and ditching me during dinner? Nah, Vivian, why would I be mad at you? I'm sorry. I've been under a lot of pressure lately. Have you? Really? Seems like you've been doing reckless shit and letting others take the blame while you take cheap shots at me, your mom, and your mom's perfectly nice boyfriend. I've done nothing but support you. I don't deserve to be your punching bag. Maybe you're not who I thought you were.

"Any student who walks out will be seen as demonstrating support for the Moxie group, who has vandalized school property, an offense that is punishable by expulsion." This is serious stuff, guys. Okay? Really think about it. Because if you do this, it's your funeral. And I'm washing my hands of the whole thing.

I'm not brave. Uh, I'm not fierce like some of my friends. And I do not fit the prototype of a leader in any way, but here I am anyways. I hate that we are shoved aside. That we are dismissed, ranked, assaulted. And I mean, nobody does anything about it. Nobody listens to us. And that is why I walk out today. That's why I'm standing up here yelling at all of you. It's why I started Moxie. [laughing] You know what? If you're going to expel somebody, expel me. Okay? It's me. I started Moxie. I am Moxie. Then expel me, too. I started the Moxie Instagram, and I did that shit proudly. I got you. [Kaitlynn] I protested the dress code. I wear what I want no matter what my body looks like, and I'm never changing. - Yeah. - So expel me! I tripped Bradley in his dumb ass Pirate costume. That's feminism right there. And I do not feel bad about it. Moxie forever! [cheering, whooping] I wrote the note. [students fall silent] [whispering] [Emma] Um… I'm the one who reached out for help. Because it felt like Moxie was the only one who was listening. We're listening. We're here. And we believe you. Last year after prom… Mitchell Wilson raped me. [students murmuring] He was my boyfriend… And he raped me in my own bedroom. [voice breaking] And then, I got voted Most Bangable. What does that even mean? Sorry, I don't know what to say. I don't know what… I feel. I guess I'm just angry. I'm angry, and I want to scream. - Do it. - Scream! Scream! [screams] [laughs] [all screaming] [screams] [screams fade away] What does that mean? Mitchell Wilson. Yes? Come with me. I knew it. I knew it was you. - [Vivian laughs] - Wait, no you didn't. It is always the quiet ones you have to look out for. - My mind is blown. I'm so proud of you. - Thanks. - [CJ] You killed it. - [Claudia] Pretty good for an introvert. - What are you doing here? - Your mom drove me. Are you even allowed here? What are they gonna do? Double suspend me? - What would I do without you? - I guess we'll never find out. - [Lucy] Inspire, right? Let me hear it. - [all] Yeah! [laughing] I can't believe you're here. [students applauding] [Lucy] One, two, three, Moxie! - [Lisa] Hey. - [Lucy] Ready. One, two, three, Moxie! - Yeah! - [cheering] Are you okay? I think so. Thanks for inspiring me. Same. [speaking Spanish] [cheering] [Lucy in English] I wanna let you know that Moxie is for everyone. - Right. - Does anybody want to speak? Come on. - [female student] Me. Me. - [whooping] Come on, girlfriend. Speak your truth. I want to... Sorry. I just want to say that I'm one hundred and ten Black. My hair is not a wig. It's not nappy. It's thick, curly, and it's who I am! [whooping, cheering] And no, you cannot touch it! [cheering] [Lucy] That was amazing. Yeah, and y'all need to stop touching our hair, okay? All right.
