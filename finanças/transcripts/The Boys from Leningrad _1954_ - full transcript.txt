A clear dome of the sky. Shows blue over our world, and the stadium is noisy. "Hi, Valya! "Hi, Vasya! Where are you going? -For coaching. -Oh! -But where is... -What? ...your umbrella? I don’t think it’s a god idea. -We||, nevertheless, it’s raining. -Yeah. Yeah. - Pardon me, please. - Please. -Va|ya! -What? Here is the umbrella. You may catch cold. - Thanks, I'll give it back today. - No, you shouldn't. It's a prese -A present? -Yes. I take the presents from my people only. - Oh, only...only from your people? - Yeah. -All the same, take it. -Oh. Valya! Here it is. It's a pleasure for me to sign such an order. You’d better sign the order of your being on leave. You see, the young people will go on leave. And they'll be defending the sports honor of the factory. They are excellent workers and perfect football-players. Ivan, why you don’t go on leave? I don’t understand. We fulfilled the plan. So, why the director doesn’t go on leave? Dear Elena! You are my secretary. All my life is before you, as on the plate. It's not interesting for me to go on leave... At the height of the football season, 'Cause my wife'll take me to the sanatorium. You know, what this summer means for me. Alas! I do. The summer means the hell for you. Literally, the hell! The paradise! The pure paradise. The sports paradise. By the way, Lena, I can say without the false modesty, That among the fans I take a very noticeable place. My friends distinguish my voice on radio at once. Especially I manage to do this! Please, Ivan! Okay, I see, I see. It's a shame for me to cry such nonsense. But I can’t help doing it, especially when I grow excited. Football is the noblest folk sport When our “Blue arrows” reached the final, I grew younger. I have a blood pressure as a student. I'm sorry, Ivan, but I don't feel any excitement... Apropos of this event. And I'm not alone. Alas! That's true. I have such a discrepancy with my wife. She doesn’t go to any match. I'm ashamed of saying that my wife doesn't admit football. By the way, she can call at any moment. Tell her I was delayed on the territory. And I'll go to the meeting of the football-players. I talk about two players. Wait a little. You see, they took Vasya Vesnushkin and Khautin from the second te No, I think Sasha is right. We must strengthen the team. Only famous players must be in the “Blue Arrows”. Grisha, we need good players, not famous names. Football is the game of young men. I suggest to take young Kandiba from Luga. Occupation? -An electrician. - Is he good'? - Fortunately, he is average. Will they let a good electrician go from works? Well, the right side is perfect. And I suggest the second one — the halfback Bambasov. -We||, everybody knows Bambasov. -|s he an average worker, too? Even better, Ivan, he is good-for-nothing. Their accountant is a fan, so he has him as a ledger clerk. But then he is a good player. Well, let's take Bambasov to our factory. No! We were living without Kandiba, so we'll do without him! We reached the final without Bambasov... So we'll win the Cup without him! - Exactly! -lvan! Because the sports honor of our factory... Doesn’t permit us to accept your offer. There is no sports honor... To the team, that aims to... Make a cafs paw of other people. Goal! No doubt, the skill is a great matter. But we needn’t those experts, we didn’t achieve a team-work with. -Whom we don’t believe. -Why we don’t believe them? Lev, but they are good players. Good, even perfect. But they leave their teams very easy, this is very suspicious. It is necessary to play many games together before you know each o To understand at once, without looking at each other's eyes. -But what is the team’s strength? -That’s right, Lev. -Did you catch the idea? -We did, Lev. Ivan, are you staying at the coaching? Certainly I stay at the “Blue Arrows” training. Great! To the field, dear friends! I see the team on the field. I supported the “Blue Arrows” all the summer and I fell sick. I have the complications. Calm down, father! It's a training. They don’t watch the weather forecast before the Cup. I know that you are right, Lev, but it turned out that I... Comrade coach! I listen to you, comrade Vesnushkin junior! -Lev! -Yes. Allow the 2nd team player to participate in the training. I don’t allow, I order to do that! - Is it clear'? - Yes, it is. The competition will be at any weather. And we'll need the spare player... Under any circumstances! That's right! Don’t notice the rain, according to the weather bureau. What will we play? Football or water polo? Water polo! Stop kidding about the rain. Let's start. Maria Vesnushkina has arrived. Yeah, a brothers-footballers’ mother. Hi, friends. Congratulations upon chilly weather! Maria, why are you here? A real fan supports his team even in rainy weather! It's about the fans. But you are a grandmother of Russian football. Yes. The Vesnushkins is a famous last name. Yes. All the sons are the inherited footballers. You should tell the coach... Not to offend your younger son. 'Cause he keeps him as a spare player. Sasha! Why you kick under my right foot all the time! Lev asked for this. -Guys! -What? Today they wrote in “The Soviet sport” that the final games... Will take place in the south. Cool! At the Black sea'? That's nice! A clear dome of the sky Shows blue over our world, and the stadium is noisy. ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ -Did you like the coaching today? -Not bad. The training was real. Sasha, is that true, that we have a good team, hey? Yeah, at any rate it doesn’t prevent me from playing. Wow! It doesn’t prevent you! -You’re lucky, that mom is in, or... -Or what? You speak about your team as if you were a casual player. Well, it's not the best one for the time being, but... Well, wait a little. But, but it depends on us... The team-work and superiority depend on us. But wait, what are you talking about! Everything depends on all of us. -Even on the spare players! -Yes. -Even on the spare players. - Fancy that! - Don't be mad, I'm just kidding. Kidding! -Hi. -Hi, Vasya. Are your relatives in? -Who do you need? -Mom or Sasha? -Everybody. -Everybody is in. That's your umbrella. Thanks a lot. Was it useful for you? Sure, when the rain stopped, the sun appeared. Take into account, you purchased the parasol! Really? -Of course. Sasha. Want to know the news? -I do. Not only football, but also gymnastics will be in Suhumi. I go to south with you, too! It is fine, isn’t it? Yes, it is. But the famous footballer kept the majestic silence. - I thought you would be glad. - Of course I'm glad! But I can’t shout at the top of my voice! Hurray! Valya! Mother! Sasha! You know, Lev has called. -Va|ya goes with us! -Oh. -For the gymnastic training. Hurray! Congratulations, Valechka! Be so kind there, impress my little ones. Especially impress myself! -Wow! -That’s beautiful! Let's go. Don’t stand up. And in nights the pool is illuminated with the searchlight. Tolya, whafs the cabin number? Come on, brother! Take a good rest there! Take it every minute! Walking-tours, excursions, dances, table talks, lectures, reports... Movies, concerts, quizzes and all the treatment. And don’t be lazy, don’t be lazy, act with eagerness. So, have a good rest to the full. Pavel, Pavel! -Do you have the reports? -We collected them. -Well, all right. -What about the reports’ duplicates? -Here they are. Well, great. While I'll be on leave, I'll examine everything. Wire me whafs going on here. I'll call you in Saturday nights. -Okay, good luck! -Good bye, Pavel! -Good bye! -Good bye. Oh, finally I can have a rest! Oh, I'll have a rest. Valya, Valya! Choose only women doctors, don’t talk to men! -Don’t make the acquaintance of them! -Sure! Write me every day. In the morning and in the evening. About where have you been, with whom have you been. Here are 6O envelopes with stamps. And 120 sheets of paper. Here is my picture. Put it on the table. 0K3)’- And take this picture with you... Everywhere all the time. When you swim, it won’t get wet... I've wrapped it in the cellophane. And remember, Valya, remember the vow of the fidelity. Oh! I'm so excited, I'm so excited! I won't sleep in nights, I'll be waiting for your coming back. Valya. Varya! Varvara! So, your team the “Blue Arrows” is making it’s way to the Caucasus Where the final Cup match takes place. Without doubt, you'll encounter team “The Vympel”. If you win, you'll gain the Cup. No mistakes. -In facts. -Very well. And the experts in calisthenics. And young people... Are going with you to the south. -Yes. -Can I have a talk with them? Vasya, where is Valya? Don't worry, I'll find them. Just a minute. This picture will be in the local paper. Excuse me! Thank you! Sasha, look, we have scarcely gone away... When we have a telegram! From our friends from the factory. They wish us bon voyage. -And also good luck and victory. -The telegram obliges us. -To be sure! -They don’t forget. -We need to respond. -We’|| respond with the victory. -But does Lev know? -Not yet. -Let’s go to show him! Quickly! -Let’s go. Excuse me. You are the assistants of the research expedition... Spiridon Violetov and Lubov Malutkina. - Yeah. - Absolutely impartially. Thank you. Yeah. Your expedition is devoted to the questions of the longevity. Yeah. Well, so to say, the questions. Professor Babushkin is your research guide. -You know... -Hey, porter, don’t be in a hurry! Don’t you worry! I don’t have any information for affirmative reply. So. And I don’t have any facts for the negative reply. Comrade Vesnushkin! A famous footballer. What do you say to do? Will I write that professor Babushkin is not on the ship. Everything is very simple. Our previous guide is sick, so we don’t know our new guide... Professor Babushkin by sight, unfortunately. But he'll follow us soon. All right, all right, comrade lvlalutkina, we’ll write it carefully. Like: professor Babushkin is already following us. So, our reporter’s interview with assistants of the expedition. The questions of the longevity: what the centenarians tell. -No mistakes? -No. -Good. Let me ask you a question. You’re welcome. Will it be boring for you... To talk only to old men there? I'm not going to the health resort, man. To my work. And besides... Any old man as a phenomenon is more interesting, then... Many impudent young men. -Look, d’you know whds that? -No. It's a famous movie actress, Galina Kartashova. Thanks. Comrade Kartashova, we know that you’re living for Suhumi... For acting in a film under direction of producer Tsvetkov. But where is him? We were looking for him, too, but found him nowhere. He’s in Sochi, all the group will leave for Suhumi. Thanks for flowers, for your attention. Good bye! Bye! Now you see what is renown. There he is! Sasha! Sasha! Sasha! -What’s up? Whafs the matter? -What? -He doesn’t hear. -Aha. He is carried away by his thoughts. Sasha! Excuse me! Hey, man! Man! -Do you hear me? -Sure I do. Oh, sorry, I thought he was deaf. Your friends are calling for you, but you don’t answer. -Excuse me! -That’s okay. Let me introduce myself. I'm the old admirer of your talent. -Ivan Dedushkin. - I'm very glad! Let me take you to the deck. -With pleasure! -Thank you! Ha-ha! You know, let everybody think that... Dedushkin has a very nice granddaughter. Now I recollect the lyrics, that I learned by heart in gymnasium. Lyrics by the ancient Roman poet Vergily. ...And the south wind, creaking with the towers... That's it! Ladies first! Sorry. I've met my friends, they talked my head off! They did it? It seemed to us you had talked their head off! Aha! Exactly. Here is one more incident! The English postal official Tailor was 134. -He got married when he was 108. -He was crazy. He had never fallen ill, he felt perfect. Queen Victoria sent him her portrait with the inscription: “For the unparalleled and extreme old age.” This excited him so that he died of shock at once! Roughly speaking... They don't die of joy. These things shorten the life a-the despondency. b-the cowardice. c-the envy. d-the fear. e-the malice. If they don’t ask about our age... We could leave as much as we like. So, the skill to prolong the life still exists! Well, not only the skill, but also the knowledge. And, of course, the skill. You know, I feel it by myself. So, I came to my real age... Only because of the skill. That's roughly speaking... But, as they say, absolutely right. My friends, the true skill is... When the inspired aged man works... lnventively, and even with the song. By the way, the song! We have a lot of songs. - Yeah! - Many songs. And all of them are about the youth, the young men. But, let me ask you, where are the songs for the aged men? -We||. -Where? -There is no such song. -What you mean — no? Jx/Vell, let's take... - Let's take, let's take... Just a minute... There is no such song, really! So, whafs the result, my friends? Let's take the middle-aged man, who works. A factory director or an old craftsman, or a bookkeeper. He wants to encourage himself with something. Well, with what do Russian people encourage themselves? With songs! With songs. So, he turns on the music. Or he starts to hum any song. What song, tell me? The song about the football or about the lonely harmonist? Or about the girls? As for me, I tried to replace the words and I sang... Instead of “girls” I sang: “grandma and granddad” It's approximately, as comrade Zvyagin says. In short, my friends there is no songs for old men. But they have a pension. Yes. The pension. But no songs. You know, the old man is the honorary status. Let them give a song to old men! Old men are the people, too! Old men want to sing, too, damn it! - That's right! That's right. - Bravo! Bravo! You said the wonderful things! And you excited me! I' m composer Dneprovsky. I promise you to write the song for aged men. So, I fly to the grand piano. Great! Good bye. Good bye! I hope we'll meet again! Dedushkin! Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. -Spiridon! -Yes. -I made a discovery! -What? What will you think about Dedushkin? Do you know who he is? What d’you mean — who he is? He is the incognito. Do you see, the incognito! It dawned upon me! It's professor Babushkin from Moscow! Dedushkin! How can he be Babushkin! Yes, professor Babushkin said... His last name was Dedushkin! -Why? Why? -‘Cause of the modesty. Or maybe to know us insensibly. To know the members of our expedition. The acquaintance with the members — it’s a half of success! So witty! So, our Babushkin is Dedushkin now? -Yes, he is. -We know that! So, everybody asks for waltz! Waltz, waltz, waltz! Wait, can you play something new? No, waltz! Just a minute, gentleman! Galina! Let's vote! -The voting! -The voting! NOW! Dear navigators! Who votes for the dance of our grandmas and granddads? And our grandsons and granddaughters? Who votes for eternally alive waltz? Excuse me! - Galina, allow me! - Please! The beauty, as comrade Lesnovsky says! -Just look! -Thank you! -Do you dance? -No. May invite you for dancing? It's Babushkin. -Sorry, I don’t dance. -Yes. Excuse me, can I invite you? - Sure! - Certainly, but I'm... Please, you know, I can’t either do it very well. Say, why are you so anxious? Aren’t you enjoying here? Enjoying? I don’t think about fun, I think about the forthcoming w -Even while you’re dancing? -Yes. Oh, excuse me, I won’t disturb you. Now I see, it’s Babushkin! Damn it! This Dedushkin develops the feverish activity! Look, look! Oh! Let me invite you for the next dance! Oh! I'm sorry, but I've already promised to other! I see, you failed to dance with anybody. That's okay. I'm a patient man. Whom have you promised to, if it’s not a secret? To Ivan Dedushkin. You know, I saw you on the winter stadium. You work perfectly! And you select the music to everyone’s liking. - I'm really very glad! - Me too. How could you admit that old aggressor to dance with Valya? Whafs wrong? He is very nice old man. How can you know old men? You debate as a dabbler. You’re welcome! If you only knew, how good he is at sports! Does he? - He said that my exercises... - You shouldn't continue. A||’s clear. He is a promising patriarchy. -What? -He’s a charming dinosaur. Whafs wrong with you, Sasha? I'll be ready for your society in about 5O years. Comrade captain, where is your surprise? - You'll see. Jx/Vill I'? What kind'? - Marine polka. - Never heard about it. - You'll do soon. - Should I announce it'? -You’re welcome! -But... The orchestra, please, Marine polka! I eager to listen to the radio. I can’t even think about other thi Try to distract. Think about something else. About what? When I want to think about something good, I think about Valya. -Good evening! -Hi. Today in the Cup game... 2 football teams meet: “Zarya” and “Vympel”. “Vympe|”s players are in good sports form. Any team of experts can be envious... Of their skill... To manage the ball. In spite of the enemy’s stubborn resistance, The match finished at the score 7:1 in favour of “Vympel”. Friends! -Let’s face the danger. -What are you talking about? Nothing. Do you wanna beat the weaker ones'? Yeah, we'll win. -We will. -Sure. 7:01 A team of experts can admire them, but what about us? We’|| se that after the match. If you think about your defeat before the battle - you'll lose. - The golden words! - Exactly! We finish all the talks for today! Grisha! -Yes, Lev? -The regulations. Let's go. Look, Sasha! You can’t play in such mood. Can you imagine the solder... Who doesn’t believe in victory? Of course, nope. But you a talented sportsman, who exemplified for the team! How can you lose the belief in your guys? But, our staff won’t do for playing with “Vympel”. Uh. O.K. You won’t play this game with “Vympel”. So, you decided to do without me. Unfortunately. -I see. - Can I buy the back ticket'? - No, you'll be a spare player. I'm a disciplined guy. That's right, Vasya, good! Easy, easy! Starkin, accept it softly! Like this! Good! Sasha, whafs wrong with your face? What? You look like you have a bad teeth. -What was the score? -7:1. Then I'll look at your faces. You don’t take my advice. Look, Grisha, I start thinking that... You don’t improve yourself well. Our age doesn't matter for us, If we pursue the important goal, So, friends, be always young! ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ Hurray to the Soviet cinema workers! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray to respectable gymnasts! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! A dogs name. 2 letters. Yeah. Now the Roman emperor's head-dress. 3 letters. -3 letters! - It's a crying shame! -Good morning. -Good morning. Take your seat, please. You are in ladies' society as usual. -As you see. -Let’s drink this “Majari” wine. - No, thanks. - It's better eat some yogurt. To you, to you, granddad Don Juan. Man, I advise you to take cold shower. Revives. - Is it you who says me that'? - It's me! You know, it’s a pity you’re in declining years. Then what? You said that in |ady’s presence. I would... -What? -I would knock you out. -What did you say? Knock...what? Knock you out. Oh, whafs that, Galina? Does it mean boxing? - Boxing. - It's a crying shame! D’you really want to compete in boxing? With you? You’re a man with sense of humor, one can’t be angry with you. Galina, tomorrow we have a sport party on the steamer. -For sportsmen and amateurs. -So what? So, you wanna knock me down. Certainly! I accept your challenge. You know, I drank some “Majari”. Pretty playful wine. -“|\/|ajari”. -But now |’m O.K. -Do you know what is boxing? -Sure, boxing. You and me - that's funny! But do the bearded men box? Enough to make a cat laugh! Galina, he’s afraid! -You’re afraid! -You’re afraid. Do you refuse, man? Refuse? Well, comrade Kartashova. Be my witness. I'm just a football player, not boxer. But I'm just 26, do you see what can happen'? What? So, comrade Dedushkin, if you change your mind, tell me. Ain’t I understand jokes? Well, Galina, let's go. Now you'll see very beautiful banks. And you'll find the boxer's gloves... -In ship's sports team. -You don’t say so! I understand jokes, too. Bye, gentleman. Hi, colleagues. Am I correct- comrade Violetov and comrade Malutkina? - Absolutely right. - How do you know us'? It's simple. Malutkinefs work. You work on such a hot day! Poor ones. You can’t handle with skilled workers in that way. Dear sirs, let's be friends! Babushkin. Babushkin? Are you Babushkin? Exactly! Professor Babushkin from Moscow. You hypothesized without checking... Experiments and collected facts! So, as a result of your lightness... Professor... Yes! Your lightness! It turned out that Dedushkin... ls not Babushkin, and Babushkin is not Dedushkin! It's a crying shame! You overheated by the sun. - Take it off, you'll be better. - Really'? Really. Quickly, quickly! Come on, come on! Move it, move it! You are a film-group director? Where is producer? -This is producer. -What’s going on? -Comrade Tsvetkov! --Oh, no, no! -Please, take! -Okay, thanks a lot! -Vasi|y! _Oh Ga = I H“ 'ya! Fine. -I was waiting for you so long! -You look great! Really? -Here. Thanks. Hi! We love cinema. O.K. Very well. Peter! Have you loaded the ventilators? Ventilators!

Our creative work. The point is that we’re shooting the movie “Under full sail”. There is a role of old scientist, geologist. He’s very cheerful, hale and even eccentric. And I'd like a young actor to play... This part. Namely, comrade Svetlanov. Well, the role is pretty hard. So, I asked the young actor Svetlanov... To live here, on this ship for several days. In order to make sure in the truth of this character. I asked our Galya to be observer and inspector. W s our actress... Galina Kartashova. It is interesting! Excuse me, my friends. Now, let me introduce you this... Young actor. Now you know actor Svetlanov. As you can see, he’s very talented actor. Besides, he’s a sportsman, he’s a boxer. Friends, we suffer a loss. We’ve lost so remarkable companion. So remarkable old man. How terrible! Friends, it’s so terrible! Don’t worry, friends, don’t worry! I'll be the old man. You know, I'll be the real old man! Wait for 3O years. And we'll meet again! It can be possible! Our age doesn't matter for us, If we pursue the important goal So, friends, be always young! ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ ‘ Look! Oh! Whafs going on? Svetlanov is a boxer, he'll beat him. -That’s simple. -Sure! What a disgrace! Sasha is a leading player, not the spare one... One cannot beat even the spare players. -Thanks, Valya, in the name of them. -Oh my God! He is not a boxer -And he’s a good fellow! -But he challenged for me! And then, Galina, with whom he will fight? Dedushkin. That's okay, he'll stay alive. Attention! Attention! Svetlanov and Vesnushkin are challenged to the ring. Kolya! Kolya, please, keep your face! - Or else we can't photograph you. - Calm down, Vasily. Please, don’t beat him too strong, he’s got angry. Galya, I'll do it slightly, just to teach him a lesson. Friends, allow me to come to the ring. I don’t want to slink away. What a disgrace! Do you think it’s decent to challenge the old man to the fight? Friends, I don’t know how it happened! Friends, the fight starts! Lev, it’s better to be knocked out then to be exposed to shame! Do you understand the idea? -Vesnushkin is absent! He is afraid! -He is scared of our Dedushki A significant event! Old guys, we frightened that boaster. My, what Arrows! I challenge Vesnushkin for the last time! I'm here. Here. Vesnushkin is here! Vasya, what are you doing? Friends, just a minute! -Friends, it’s not Vesnushkin! -What d’ you mean? I'm a real Vesnushkin! Here is my identity card. Misha, gimme the identity card. -Vesnushkin, here it is! -Sure, Vesnushkin! -The “Blue Arrows”, Vesnushkin. -Then, it’s another Vesnushkin! That, who challenged me was a bit older. When you were challenged, you were older, too. -That’s it. Are you a boxer? -Even more. -What d’ you mean — more? -More than a boxer. Yeah, I'm from the “Blue Arrows”! Let's start, 'cause I have no time. “Blue Arrows”, “Blue Arrows”! “Blue Arrows”, “Blue Arrows”! Boxers, to the center! Shake hands! To the corners! - Boxer, are you ready'? - I'm ready. -Boxer, are you ready? -Yes, I am. Time! The first round! Come on, come on, come on! You can’t beat boldly!

Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Box! -Stop that! -Why? -P|ease stop the fight. -What’s the matter? -Vesnushkin cannot fight. -Why? I'm a coach of the football team “Blue Arrows”. We go to important competitions. Stop the fight. Friends! I also ask to stop the fight! The point is that the sea is very choppy. Yes. It's very difficult to fight on this ring. -Why, sea is very quiet. -Friends, I offer the draw. -The draw! The draw! -That’s right, the draw. Why the draw, we win! Okay, I accept the draw. He'll be an outstanding old man! Excuse me, comrade Kolimagin, that it’s happened so. Please, allow me. I gotta tell you that you brought up a perfect sportsman! What a will to win! He can be a good boxer. -A boxer? -Yeah. Golden words. - It's only between us. - O.K. He’s already becoming a good football player. Congratulations, Vasya! “Blue Arrows”, “Blue Arrows”! -Does it hurt you? -Nope. -Nope, now it’s okay. -Oh! You see now? You were punished for boxing, too. Lev rebuked me. As for me, he was right. What? Right? -Right. -Right. The devil knows whafs the boxing before the final match. Devil knows what! Sasha, it means...that you understood everything? Sure, I did. That was all my fault. But I don't believe we'll win. What d' you say, Sasha! Okay, stop. Go. It's better for me to stay alone. -But will you challenge anybody? -I won’t. Do you say me that as an older brother? As a brother. -And as a striker? -Yes. Thanks. From your brother. Yes. And from all the team. Vasya is a real sportsman. He came to the ring, he values his team’s honour. But you love Vasya. I don’t know. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe! -Andrey! Maybe! -What may be? Maybe! Hey! Are you okay? Should I wet you with the water? Water? Maybe. Hey! Maybe. Release the corridor for the left side. Okay? Well. -Do you understand the idea? -Yes I do. So we approve the real plan of the ahead match. 'Appove. 'Approve, And the last item. Vesnushkin will play on the right side. - Th at' s rig ht. - Exactly! -That’s right. -We should forgive Sasha. Vesnushkin will play on the right side. -Vesnushkin junior! -Why? Why Vesnushkin junior? You see, Grisha, when there are 2 brothers in a family... Then one is always older, other is younger. -But, Sasha... -We won’t change our mind. Sasha have time to think about his behavior. And I think it's logically to include... Vesnushkin junior. -Do you understand the idea? -I do. Not to everybody. From the one hand, I understand, but... From the other hand — it depends! Nice speech! So to say... Not bad speech, too! Will we win having this staff? Lev, it offends me. But Vasya is in better shape then me now. - Sasha, what do you say! - It's necessary to assign him. I'll play in next match. So, nobody leaves for other teams... Stop! Stop! Friends, to your cabins. We’|| see Suhumi soon. A beautiful city. Yeah, but we'll not have time to admire it. Then let this city admire us! Grisha, you should share with the team, hey! To share what? Your modesty. 'Cause you have too much of it. -Excuse me, Lev. -To your cabins! To your cabin, friends! - Ivan! - Hi, Maria! -Are you here, too? -Yes, I am. What fates bring you here! That's my wife, Olga. And this is Maria, brothers' Vesnushkins mother.
