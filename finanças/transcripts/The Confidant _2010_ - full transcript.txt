Get your hands off me, man. So answer me this, Nigel. What was so important that you couldn't pick up your so-called best friend? I thought your release was tomorrow. - I apologize. - [ Laughs ] - Fuck you, Nigel! - Hey hey hey. You two gotta take that elsewhere. Look, I got this. Look-- oh! Come-- come-- come on! Here you go.

Let me think. All right, listen. Listen. - You were gambling. - Huh? - You were gambling. - What? Wait wait, what are you talking about? - Just fucking go with the story. - What story? Okay, you were gambling! That's the story, bro! Nigel, you're not making any sense. If you fucking listen, you'll understand what's going on. Okay? You were gambling. - He tried to Rob you, all right? - No no no. - He tried to Rob-- - I don't like the way this sounds-- - and tried to Rob you! - Come on. Asking me to come pick you up is one thing, but you want me to take a fall for this? Shut the fuck up, man! Shut up, man! Listen to me, Daniel. Listen to me, man. You had a scuffle. You accidentally stabbed-- oh, no no no no no. Nigel, Nigel, no. Look, if they knew I was here, we'd lose out on our contract. Right? Millions of dollars for me and you. All right? Just-- just back off, man. Give me a second. You know what you're asking me to do? This is my life, Nigel. Listen, I promise you, bro, I'm gonna take care of you for the rest of your life. Okay? [ Distant siren wailing ] What the hell happened, Daniel? Daniel! He tried to Rob me. - Francesca: Good morning. - [ Gasps ] It's time for breakfast. Hey. Good morning. [ Chuckles ] - You remember Eden? - [ All chuckle ] Who could forget the most beautiful girl in the school? Oh, still the charmer. Man! How long has it been? Uh, it's been 11 years, but who's counting? Well, I was, uh, telling Eden you're gonna be staying with us for a little while until you get on your feet. No, I think after I eat, I'll be leaving. - Nigel: No, come on, Daniel. - Jackson. Call me Jackson. Jackson-- why? I mean, after 11 years of somebody calling you by your last name, you kind of get used to it. So call me Jackson. - Sure. - So, Jackson, what kind of plans do you have? I really like art. I was hoping to find a job at an art gallery, save up some money and eventually start my own. Wow. Yeah, I remember his beautiful paintings at school. Right, babe? You were on a full art scholarship? Yeah, I was. They actually let me finish my degree while I was in. It's not quite Michigan state, but at least I finished. Wow, that's wonderful. Babe, why don't you go check on your bath water? I'm sure it's ready by now. - Okay. - Mmm. [ Chuckles ] It was good seeing you, Jackson. It was good seeing you too. [ Chuckles ] Yeah, that's my world right there. Mmm. You know, I could really use your help around here. See, when Eden lost our last baby, she just sunk into this depression. She doesn't work right now-- you know, the meds and everything. So she spends a lot of time alone at home. And we don't have family, so it'd be nice to have you around. I guess it ain't all peaches and cream, huh? - Look, Daniel-- - Jackson. I mean Jackson... We can bicker and fight. You can resent me all you want, but it's not gonna help either one of us progress. It's not gonna fix anything. - Now I know what you're going through. - [ Laughs ] You know what the fuck I'm going through? You tell me how it feel to give your future away to your best friend who promised you everything. And he can't even come and see you one time while you locked up. Look, i-- I gotta go to work. No no no, hold on, partner. Man, you can't even look me in my eyes, Nigel. I know saying I'm sorry does not make up for 11 years. But look, when I promised you I was gonna take care of you, I meant it. Now I'm not a billionaire, but you can stay here as long as you need. [ Laughs ] - We got a lot of catching up to do. - Yeah. [ Water running ] I love my beautiful bracelet. Thank you. May I help you? Francesca, is that you? I was just looking for the bathroom. Well, this is not it. Follow me. Look... I'd like to keep this between you and me. It was just a mistake. Besides, I didn't see anything. Me no speak english. [ Chuckles ] Sure. I get it. Your room is down here on the right. Your bathroom too. - Gracias. - Let's go. So... how long is Jackson going to be staying with us again? I'm not sure. What did he go to jail for? Why are you asking so many questions? I know you're happy to see him, but it's like living with a complete stranger. - Well, I owe him. - Well, if you want to help him out, Nigel, why don't you just give him some money? Well, it's a little more complicated than that. Look, I could've sworn somebody was looking at me today - while I was in the bath. - [ Chuckles ] It probably was just your imagination. How can you be so sure? Because he is gay, all right? That's what happens when you're in jail for that long. Trust me. Well, I didn't think about that. That's what it is. Well, maybe you shouldn't drop the soap then. - [ Laughs ] - Ah! No! Stop it, stop it, stop it. That is not funny. Just don't worry about him, all right? He won't be here much longer, I promise. [ Ship horn blares ] [ Bird squawks ] Yeah. [ Laughs ] - Have a sweat. - Wow, man. This is a real nice boat. How long have you had it? Uh... a while. I made the first down payment in college. So that's where all the gambling money went to, huh? - [ Pours drink ] - Well, you know I love the water. This is the first thing I paid off with my signing bonus. Where did all that money go to? - Well-- - thank you. Hmm. Well, I blew my knee out in my third year, so I couldn't perform. Even though my contract was for $30 mil, it was all performance based. See, people hear about all the money. They don't know what it takes to actually make it-- touchdowns, yardage, number of playoffs-- the list goes on and on. Half the million-dollar athletes I know are broke. So how did you make out? All right. We had a couple investments that carried us over. And your gambling? [ Laughs ] That is like my rush. It's like being on the football field. Nigel, you know your gambling is what got me locked up 11 long years. Man, I wrote you every week and you never replied. I just got caught up in the hype, man. And then I lost everything. I didn't know how to tell someone I promised everything to that I had barely... Anything left to give. Look, I got a day job. And the rest of my money comes from the league pension. You still could have wrote me back, Nigel. I took the fall for you, bro. I read every single one of your letters. And it hurt every time because I knew I owed you my life. When you say you owe me your life, do you mean it? Yes, I do. To new beginnings.

Why you locking doors now, hmm? - What's wrong with you? - Nothing. [ Sighs ] I'm sorry I've been so out of it lately. - I love you. - I love you too. You know, I've been thinking about having another baby. - [ Chuckles ] - Really? Yeah. I just have to take care of a couple of things and then we should discuss it. Okay. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I-I'm fine. I'm just-- I'm just a little tired. Okay. I'm gonna get ready for work. Nigel: Patterson, 43, 93. Yes, um, I'd like to take out an additional loan on the boat. What do you mean I don't possess the title? That-- that's my boat. I've owned the boat for 15 years. Thanks. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck! Oh. [ Grunting ] What the hell? Oh god. [ Phone buzzing ] [ Beeps ] - Thank god. What's up? - Claude: Nigel, listen. I got some info on that Asian chick. Yeah? She was just released from the state pen. She did a 10-year stretch for drug trafficking and money laundering. - Drug dealer? - Yeah yeah, but listen to this. She beat a five-count murder charge. Now there's no history of her gambling though. Okay, um, good. All right, thank you. Thanks. Nigel... You be careful. [ Phone beeps ] [ Sighs ] [ Tires screech ] Man: Half a million. Not a penny more, I told you. Because that's what it's worth. Look, if you want to go to Lucas, that is your privilege. But I tell you, he won't give you any more. No. Well, I have other things in the works. Mm-hmm. So let me know by tomorrow. Good. Where's Anthony? He's not here. I'm vladamir. Hold on. Nobody told me about no vladamir. Then leave. Nobody's holding a gun to your head. - Huh? - Okay, wait wait, look, wait. All right. All right. [ Jewelry jangling ] Can you hurry up? I mean-- relax. You'll give yourself heart attack. Ah. All right, it, uh-- it looks good. [ Speaks Russian ] Hold-- hold on. Where is he going? You want to get paid, don't you? Yeah. So how much are we talking? $50,000. I paid 45 for this watch alone. My friend, nothing here is new. This is street value. You understand, huh? You can take it or you can leave it. All right. Fuck! Okay, look, wait. I got this. This is my wife's wedding ring. Ah. It's very beautiful. - Yes. - How much? - $30,000. - 40. [ Laughs ] You're killing me. 35. - Okay. - Good. Deal. Eden: Babe, have you seen my wedding ring? I think I lost it again. That's-- that's what I need to talk to you about. Oh my god! What happened to your face? Oh no. I'm-- I'm okay. I-I can explain. I love you. I love you too, Nigel. What's wrong? I lost a lot of money we don't have. You promised me you would stop. - But I was up. - How much? - How much? - $250,000. Wait a minute. Is that why you stole my wedding ring? You put me through this same mess when I was pregnant. And you blamed me when I lost the baby. But because I loved you, never once-- never once did I tell you how much pressure-- how much pressure you put on me, our marriage, our unborn child. Because you are selfish, Nigel. I can fix this, okay? And after that, we can start over. Start over with what? All I need is the money from our savings. It's gone. No no. No no. That's ridiculous. It's not gone. - It's gone. - How can it be gone? I used it on fertility treatments. What? Are you kidding me? - You haven't been listening, Nigel. - Yes, I have. No, you haven't! You have been hearing me, but you have not been listening, Nigel. And there is a difference. We are supposed to be one flesh. One unit. Oh! How could you go behind my back like that? Why don't you ask yourself the same fucking question? Oh, god. Eden... You had every right to do what you did. I'm sorry. I don't want you to worry about a child or money or anything else for that matter... Ever again. I mean it. And I am listening. I want you to know I'd rather die before I'd ever hurt you again. [ Sighs ] [ Phone ringing ] [ Phone beeps ] - Hello. - Black: Eight hours. Look, lady, I got about 100 large. If you give me some more time, I can get the rest in a few... Weeks. Eden sure is pretty. You leave my-- you leave my wife - out of it. - No. You leave her out of this. $250k in eight hours or one of you is going to be writing a eulogy. You don't touch my wife. You hear me? You don't touch my wife. [ Beeps ] Wow, I was told Francesca left on some type of family emergency. She was my caretaker and she just stopped coming in. Well, we're still gathering information from her family - and we will need your help. - [ Phone ringing ] Oh, pardon me. - [ Beeps ] - Hello. Yuri: Hey, Eden. Is Jackson in? No, but I can take a message. I actually called to speak to you. I-- oh god, I don't know how to say this, but I saw something in Jackson's room that really disturbed me. What? Here's your cut. He's going to bring the rest of the money by tonight. Really? You didn't think I was going to kill him, did you? [ Plastic rustling ] [ Camera whirring ] Jackson: I've been waiting on this for a very long time. You know how Nigel told me everything that was his was mine? - [ Jackson laughs ] - [ Eden crying ] No. Jackson: I'd love that. Yuri: You're gonna feel so much better. Come here. No. Nigel. I'm so sorry, Nigel. Nigel: Yes. I need to make this effective immediately. I can sign and fax you everything right now. Man: Look, it took me a while to get this approved because it was such a drastic change in your policy, but, uh, I pushed it through and I got it done. Okay, we have Eden Patterson as your primary beneficiary for $9 million and Daniel e. Jackson for $1 million. - Is that correct? - Correct, yes. [ Gasps ] Oh my god. [ Whispers ] Francesca. Eden. Eden. Eden! Nigel: Eden! Baby! Wake up. Why did you do that? Wake up. Wake up, come on. - Come on. Please. - [ Dials ] Please wake up, baby. Yes, you-- [ Gasps ] Gotta come here quick, please-- my wife. My wife is dying. Why did you do that? Why did you do that? This is all my fault. I'm so-- I'm so sorry. Come on, move. Come on! [ Sobbing ] Wake up. Please, god! Please! [ Screams ] No! No. Hmm. Oh, no. Oh, no no no. No. [ Phone ringing ] Jackson: Meet me at the same spot we used to meet at. I think you know where it is. Eden: Do you know what time Francesca left today? She didn't come in. She said it was some kind of family emergency in Mexico. Nigel's voice: I came out here to ask you if you wanted to stick around for a little while. Help around the house, watch over Eden. Is she safe? Nigel's voice: I don't use trick cards anymore. I always let them see me sweat so my opponents think they got me figured out. Black's voice: Do you like my dress? I've got on my lucky one. My... lucky... one. [ Tires screech ] [ Revs engine ] Jackson: I've been waiting on this a long time. Eden: Get off of me! Don't! [ Grunting ] - [ Gasps ] - Yuri: Eden! [ Coughing ] [ Gasping ] [ Phone buzzing ] Aren't you gonna answer that? - [ Beeps ] - Hello. Nigel. Where the hell are you? I've been trying to reach you. Listen, black is dead. I need you to tell me what the hell is going on. Everything's okay, Claude. Thank you. You've been a true friend. I got everything under control. Hey hey. Wait wait wait. Listen, damn it. - Listen to me. - [ Clicks ] [ Sighs ] What the fuck was that, man? What's going on? I ran into Francesca today. Huh. How's she doing? Dead! Where the fuck you taking me to, Nigel? What's going on? - Read that letter. - I don't want to read no-- - read that letter! - You tell me what's going on! Read the letter. "When you went away, it was the worst day of my life." Read it! "Now I promise you..." You made me an additional beneficiary for $1 million? Yeah, see? Read the fucking letter. "I know money can't get you back the years you've lost... But I'm willing to give you my life in return. I love you both dearly. Nigel Patterson." What the fuck is this? Is that what you wanted? Huh? - You killed her. - It was both of us. - You killed her. - [ Tires screeching ] Get off me! - Get off me! - [ Car horn blares ] 11 years of my life! Get off me. - Oh, shit! - [ Loud crash ] [ Woman vocalizing ] [ Birds twittering ] [ Loud crash ] [ Crickets chirping ] Eden: Sometimes you spend your whole life searching for a paradise. And at the end of the day you realize the very thing you've been searching for, you already had. I guess I had to lose it to realize it. For many of us this is a never-ending story. I mean, some will never see the insatiable thirst for the illusion of perfection and temptation that always pushes them to the edge. Thank you, doctor. No, thank you for opening up. Well, I have a flight to catch. Have a safe trip. And again, congratulations on the baby. I know you'll make a wonderful mother. You really do deserve it. Thank you.
