THIS IS EXACTLY THE SITUATION THAT LIFE OFFERS YOU A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO GROW. I MEAN, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SOME BITTER ASSHOLE, RIGHT? GOTTA LEARN TO HONOR YOUR FEELINGS, AND FACE YOUR PAIN, AND GET TO KNOW WHO YOU ARE, AND GO INTO THOSE NASTY CORNERS OF YOUR PSYCHE, AND FACE SHIT. DO YOU GET MY MEANING ABOUT...

BEING ABLE TO MAKE YOUR OWN CHOICES AND BE YOUR OWN PILOT, AND HAVE YOUR OWN WILL. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I MOVED HERE TO NEW YORK CITY, BECAUSE I WANTED TO FEEL REALLY, REALLY ALIVE AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE RHYTHM HERE, WHICH I LOVE. YOU'RE NOT FREE, YOU HAVE NO FREEDOM. EXCUSE ME? LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE MANUFACTURED. WITH YOUR DIET, AND YOUR HAIRCUT. TALKING A MILE A MINUTE BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID YOU WON'T BE ENTERTAINING ENOUGH. YOU'RE LIKE A MILLION WOMEN I SEE ON THE STREET EVERY DAY FALLING ALL OVER THEMSELVES, TRYING ANYTHING, SO THEY WON'T BE LONELY. IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR TO ME. I SEE RIGHT THROUGH IT. YOU HAVE NO FREEDOM. YOU'RE TERRIFIED. YOU'RE ORDINARY. YOU'RE A LITTLE PATHETIC. YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO DO THAT TO MY FRIEND. IF YOU'RE MISERABLE, THAT'S YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM. - YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT ON THE WORLD. - YEAH. - SHE IS A GREAT PERSON. - SHE TALKS TOO MUCH. SOMEBODY HAD TO PICK UP THE SLACK.

YOU COULD GO UP THERE, GET HER BACK, THEN DUMP HER ON HER ASS. THAT'S WHAT I'D DO. WELL, YOU'RE SPECIAL. DID YOU EVEN TRY TO GET HER TO STAY? - NO. - NO? IT WAS A PHONE CALL, EDDIE. SHE CALLED ME ON THE PHONE. THE CLOSET WAS EMPTY. - SHE WAS GONE. - LISTEN TO ME... I HAVE TWO VERY IMPORTANT WORDS FOR YOU: RE-BOUND. YOU NEED TO HAVE SEX-- WITH NEW PEOPLE. DIFFERENT PEOPLE. LOTS OF PEOPLE. - I CAN'T. - YOU CAN'T? THEN YOU'VE GOT TO GET HER BACK, OR YOU GOT TO KILL YOURSELF. I AM ALL OUT OF IDEAS HERE. WHAT DID YOU THINK OF HER, EDDIE? SHE WASN'T THAT GREAT, WAS SHE? NAH. SHE WAS AVERAGE. I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING, SHE WASN'T WORTH THIS HEARTACHE. - YOU'RE RIGHT. - YEAH, I'M RIGHT. AND HE'S... THERE'S NOT EVEN A WORD FOR HIM. NO, THERE ISN'T. SON OF A BITCH.

YOU GOT A MINUTE? - NO. - GOOD. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A GUN LIKE THIS BEFORE? - NO. - IT'S A CLASSIC. 1873 PINKERTON DETECTIVE. THEY DON'T MAKE GUNS LIKE THIS ANYMORE.

SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS A PROBLEM BETWEEN YOU TWO. HEY, MAYBE I'M WRONG. I WAS JUST CURIOUS. I'VE NEVER HAD A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP, SO I WAS WONDERING WHAT IT WAS LIKE. WOULD YOU SAY YOU AND ROSE HAVE SEX VERY OFTEN? ( laughing ) BERNICE? I SAW YOU WALK IN TO THE STORE. I WAS GOING TO FOLLOW YOU IN, BUT I WAITED HERE INSTEAD. I TRIED TO CALL YOU BEFORE. WELL, I'M NOT ANSWERING MY PHONE, OR CHECKING MY MESSAGES OR GOING TO WORK OR BRUSHING MY HAIR-- NOT SINCE THAT NIGHT. WELL, I TRIED TO CALL YOU. I REALIZE I WASN'T VERY NICE, AND I'M SORRY.

I DON'T LIKE STELLA TO SEE ME LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME. HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN MY GRANDMOTHER? OH, I'VE KNOWN YOUR GRANDMOTHER 68 YEARS. SINCE GRAMMAR SCHOOL. WE WENT TOGETHER IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEN I WAS AWAY IN THE ARMY DURING THE WAR, AND WHEN I CAME BACK, SHE HAD MARRIED YOUR GRANDFATHER, JOEL. WHICH WAS A TRAGEDY FOR ME, BECAUSE I LOVED HER. SEVERAL YEARS AGO, I LEARNED THAT JOEL HAD PASSED, AND I SET OUT TO WIN HER HEART. TWO YEARS AGO, I WON IT. AND SHE WOULD HAVE ME, AND HERE WE ARE. ( bells chiming ) SHE'S AWAKE.

BUT YOU'RE A STRANGER, MAYBE YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS. NOT CICI. SHE WAS ALWAYS FINE. MAYBE A LITTLE TOO FINE. I DON'T KNOW. IF YOU SAY "I DON'T KNOW" TO ME ONE MORE TIME, I'M GONNA SMACK YOU IN YOUR AREA, I SWEAR TO GOD. DID SHE TELL YOU ABOUT HER FATHER? THAT HE DIED? AND HER MOTHER? NO. SHE SIMPLY TOOK OFF ONE DAY... A YEAR LATER. CICI NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT. THE DOCTOR GAVE HER SOME VALIUM. BACK THEN, THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT GRIEF. I'M NOT SURE THEY KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOW, MA'AM. YOU DO KNOW HOW TO SPEAK IN FULL SENTENCES. GOOD. NOW LISTEN TO ME, BILL. I WANT YOU TO MAKE SURE NOTHING HAPPENS TO HER. I'M NOT SAYING MARRY HER, JUST LOOK OUT FOR HER. THERE ARE A LOT OF SWINE AND WOLVES AND BASTARDS OUT THERE-- LET ME TELL YOU, BILL, CICI HAS KNOWN THEM ALL. GO ON BRUSHING. AHH. OH, NO, NO. $500? AY-YI! ARE THEY NUTS? ( piano playing ) LIKE THE WINE, BILL? HURRY UP, STEL! DINNER'S GETTING COLD. Stella: FUCK YOU, I'M COMING. COME OUT HERE AND WATCH ME WALK DOWN THE STAIRS. YOU TOO, BILL. THESE SOCKS ARE SO STUPID. I'M SORRY, YOU CAN'T GO BAREFOOT. YOU'LL CATCH CANCER. OH, HEAVENLY ANGELS. BILL, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SUCH A SIGHT? NO, I HAVEN'T. TELL HER HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE IS. GRANDMA. I HAVE NEVER SEEN MORE BEAUTIFUL ANGELS DESCEND A STAIRCASE IN MY WHOLE DAMN LIFE. - ( laughing ) - NO, YEAH, IT'S TRUE. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. YOU ATE ROSES? - YES. - Bernice: SHE ATE THEM. I LOVED THEM. THEY WERE SO PRETTY. - Bill: THE STEM AND EVERYTHING? - THE STEM AND EVERYTHING. Stella: BILL, HAVE SOME MORE WINE. NO, I HAVE TO DRIVE AFTER DINNER. - I GOT TO GO OUT-- - OH, BILL. DIDN'T ANYONE EVER TEACH YOU JUST TO BE WHERE YOU ARE? CICI, POUR HIM ANOTHER GLASS. SO THAT'S WHY, WHEN GRANDMA WAS A CHILD, THEY HAD TO TAKE OFF ALL THE THORNS. NOW IT'S A TRADITION TO GIVE HER ROSES WITHOUT THORNS. I GAVE HER DOZENS AND DOZENS, BELIEVE ME. THAT WAS SOME COURTSHIP. TALK ABOUT BEGGING. - DID YOU BEG HER? - Max: DID I BEG HER? I PLEADED. I CRIED. I WROTE HER LONG LETTERS. I CALLED HER CONSTANTLY. FINALLY I JUST PLANTED MYSELF RIGHT ON HER DOORSTEP. - HE BAKED ME COOKIES. - I BAKED HER COOKIES. Stella: I LIKE COOKIES. ( laughing ) - ( coughing ) - SWEETHEART? LOVER, LOVELY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - I'M FINE. - WHERE ARE YOU GOING? - I NEED SOME WATER. - I CAN GET IT. SHE'S IN TERRIBLE PAIN. I'M TELLING YOU. NO, SHE DOESN'T SEEM SO BAD. SHE'S JUST TRYING TO KEEP IT FROM YOU. SHE'S PUTTING ON HER BEST FRONT. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO UPSET YOU. OH, JESUS, I CAN'T CRY AGAIN TODAY. SHE'LL KILL ME. WHAT WERE YOU SAYING ABOUT ME? JUST THAT YOU ARE THE LOVELIEST. AW. SO, GRANDMA, DO YOU LIKE MY GOWN? I LOVE IT! I LOVE YOUR GOWN. IT REMINDS ME OF THAT ONE YOU MADE YOUR FRIEND GINA FOR THE PROM. Bernice: IT IS. IT'S THE GINA PROM DRESS, ONLY A NICER FABRIC. YOU MADE THAT GOWN? YEAH. AND THOSE OTHERS...? - AND THE OTHERS. - THEY'RE ALL YOURS? YEAH. THEY WEREN'T SELLING, AND YOU KNOW WHY? 'CAUSE THEY WERE CHARGING WAY TOO MUCH. THEY'RE NICE. Stella: NICE? THEY'RE FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. SHE COULD DO ANYTHING, MY GRANDDAUGHTER. SHE COULD MAKE A WHOLE DRESS. SHE COULD PLAY THE TUBA. SHE COULD PAINT A LANDSCAPE. AND SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU FEEL YOU WANT TO DIE, SHE COULD MAKE YOU LAUGH. I'M TELLING YOU, YOU DON'T KNOW MY GRANDDAUGHTER. NO, I DON'T. Stella: YOU MADE ME THIS GOWN, TOO. I REMEMBER, GRANDMA. - I WORE IT TO YOUR WEDDING. - DON'T. - YOU WERE MARRIED? - NO, NOT EXACTLY. SHE GOT UP TO THE ALTAR AND CHICKENED OUT. I DIDN'T CHICKEN OUT. I HAD A MOMENT OF CLARITY. HOW DID THE GROOM TAKE IT? HE MARRIED SOMEONE ELSE THREE MONTHS LATER. CONNIE ANDREWS. QUIET GIRL. ALMOST MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE. - WHY? WHAT DID HE...? - MR. NARCISSISM. FULL OF RAGE. VERY CONTROLLING. HE REALLY DIDN'T LIKE... SOUNDS. - Bill: SOUNDS? - YEAH. SOUNDS ANNOYED HIM. MUSIC AND EXCESSIVE TALKING AND CRINKLING OF-- GOD, IF YOU LAUGHED TOO LOUD, FORGET IT. ( laughs ) AND YOU LIKE THOSE THINGS? YEAH. AND THAT'S WHEN I WROTE YOU "THE BASTARD SONG." HEY, I KNOW THAT SONG. COME ON, KIDS. LET'S GO MAKE A LITTLE NOISE. Bernice: GRANDMA, I CAN'T DO THIS. Stella: DON'T SAY THAT. I JUST BRAGGED ABOUT YOU. I HAVEN'T PLAYED IN YEARS. YOU'LL REMEMBER. WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THE TUBA? WHAT, YOU WANT ME TO DIE RIGHT HERE? COME ON, IT'LL BE FUN. - RIGHT, BILL? - YEAH. I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOU PLAY. SEE? HE'D LIKE IT, TOO. COME ON. ( low honk ) SORRY. SORRY. ( plays slowly ) ( music stops ) - Bernice: I CAN'T REMEMBER. - THAT WAS GREAT. LOW SELF-ESTEEM. COME ON, CICI, FOLLOW ME. ( plays uptempo "Bill Bailey" ) OH, YEAH. NO, DON'T PLAY THIS SONG. WHY NOT?

HIS NAME WAS BILL BAILEY, AND HE WAS A VAUDEVILLE GUY. YEAH-- VAUDEVILLE. Stella: HIS GOOD FRIEND HUEY LENT HIM SOME MONEY FOR A HOTEL ROOM, AND TO MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER, HE WROTE BILL A SONG PROMISING HIM THAT HIS WIFE WOULD TAKE HIM BACK. IT BECAME A HIT.

BERNICE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? - IT'S MY CAR. - YOU CAN'T COME-- JESUS. WHERE YOU GOING? NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HER, RIGHT? YOU'RE NOT WEARING ANYTHING. THERE WASN'T EXACTLY TIME TO CHANGE. I JUST HAD TO GRAB A DRESS AND RUN OUT. - YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE. - SO WHAT HAPPENED? I KNOW SHE RAN OFF WITH YOUR FRIEND. LUCY TOLD ME. IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME. SHE WAS LIKE THAT IN HIGH SCHOOL, TOO. SHUT UP. I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU IN THE ROAD, I SWEAR TO GOD. YOU SOLD THEM THAT HOUSE UP THERE? THAT'S AWFUL. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN AWFUL FOR YOU. NO WONDER YOU WERE SO MEAN WHEN WE WENT OUT. WHAT WAS I THINKING? "HERE'S AN IDEA. I'LL GO OUT WITH A GUY WHO'S WIFE JUST LEFT HIM IN SKID MARKS." - SHUT UP. - STILL DIDN'T GIVE YOU ANY RIGHT, THOUGH. NOT ANY RIGHT TO DO TO ME WHAT YOU DID. - WHAT DID I DO? - WHAT DID YOU DO? - WHAT DID YOU DO? - I SAID A FEW NASTY THINGS AND YOU BLEW UP. IT'S NOT LIKE I TOOK AWAY YOUR SOUL. - NO? - NO.

IT DOES SOMETHING... TO YOU, YOU KNOW? TO LOOK AT SOMEONE, TO LISTEN TO SOMEONE WHO HAS SO MUCH CONTEMPT. THAT'S THE TIME TO SAY, "GOOD NIGHT, GOODBYE, I NEVER WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN, YOU CREEP." NO, THAT LETS YOU OFF. THAT MAKES YOU BELIEVE IT'S FINE TO BE CRUEL. AND IT ISN'T. AND IT WASN'T. WELL, I'M SORRY. NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU DON'T GET IT. - AND YOU'RE NOT SORRY. - I'VE GOT THE GUN BACK NOW. IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP I'M GOING TO STICK YOU IN THE TRUNK. I'D TURN BACK NOW, BUT I'M ALMOST THERE.

IT'S 8:30. ROSE DOESN'T GET UP TILL 11:00 MOST DAYS. SHE WANTED TO BEAT THE TRAFFIC. - THE RUSH HOUR. - THAT'S TOO BAD. I REALLY WANTED TO SEE MY WIFE. THAT'S OKAY. I'LL JUST VISIT WITH YOU. WE'LL CATCH UP. IT'LL BE GREAT. - OKAY. - IT'S REALLY COZY HERE. - I LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THE PLACE. - THANK YOU. - CAN I GET THE FULL TOUR? - NO, I... HAVE TO GET GOING. TO WORK.

( stuttering ) SHE'S-- SHE'S NOT HERE. REALLY, SHE'S NOT-- WHERE THE FUCK IS SHE?! COME ON! SHE WENT TO HER MOTHER'S. IT'S OKAY, RAY. HI, ROSE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? JUST-- JUST MAKING A SCENE. I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT SOONER. YOU CAN'T JUST COME INTO MY HOUSE AND WAVE A GUN AT ME. BILL! WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU WANT TO SHOOT RAY? - YOU WANT TO SHOOT ME? - NO-OO. I JUST WANT A CHANCE TO SPEAK TO YOU-- ALONE. - FINE. - THAT'S ALL I WANT. - YOU CAN HAVE IT. - FINE? SURE-- - GIVE ME THE GUN. - NO. GIVE ME THE GUN, I DON'T TRUST YOU. FUCK YOU, YOU DON'T TRUST ME. - COME ON. - DON'T CALL THE POLICE. - ROSE. - REALLY. - IT'S OKAY. - HI, Y'ALL. HEY. HI. - WHO IS THAT? - BILL, SWEETIE. I'M JUST WAITING IN THE CAR, BUT YOU TAKE YOUR TIME IN HERE, AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. HI, ROSIE! REMEMBER ME? BERNICE CLAYBURN. THEY USED TO CALL ME "CICI." WE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL TOGETHER. CICI-- YES. I REMEMBER YOU. YEAH. OH, MY GOD, WOW. IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU. DO YOU HAVE... A BATHROOM I COULD USE? BE MY GUEST. IT'S RIGHT HERE. GREAT, THANKS. Ray: WHO THE HELL WAS THAT? WHERE CAN WE HAVE SOME PRIVACY? I THINK SHE WORE THAT DRESS TO THE PROM. SHE WAS RAISED BY HER GRANDMOTHER, I THINK. IS THAT RIGHT? HOW DO YOU KNOW HER? I MET HER THROUGH MY SISTER. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT HER RIGHT NOW. SHE'S... I CAME UP HERE, I CAME UP HERE TO SAY SOMETHING TO YOU. I FORGIVE YOU. I FORGIVE YOU, AND I LOVE YOU AND I WANT YOU TO COME HOME. YOU KNOW SOMETHING, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? - RAY. - RAY. - BILL. - NO... I WON'T LISTEN TO ANY OBJECTIONS. I CAME HERE TO GET YOU BACK. WHAT HAPPENED DOESN'T MATTER. WE NEVER HAVE TO MENTION IT AGAIN. BUT YOU ARE MY WIFE. AND I TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY. YOU KNOW SOMETHING, RAY? THERE WAS A DAY I WOULD BE SITTING HERE, JUST TALKING YOUR EAR OFF, TRYING TO IMPRESS YOU. FLIRTING WITH YOU, HOPING YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS A TOTAL LOSER. LISTEN TO ME. I THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT IT, I KNOW I WASN'T A PERFECT HUSBAND. I GOT ANGRY, AND I... DID... THINGS... BUT REALLY, I'M CHANGING. I AM. TODAY, I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU THINK OF ME. NOPE. AND YOU KNOW WHY? WELL, FOR MANY REASONS, BUT THE IMPORTANT REASON, AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED, IS THIS... IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT YOU LEFT ME OVER THE PHONE FOR RAY, THAT PIECE OF SHIT. IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT YOU'RE LIVING IN THE HOUSE THAT I SOLD HIM! IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT YOU DUMPED ME LIKE YESTERDAY'S FUCKING GARBAGE. ROSE... SAY SOMETHING. I THINK YOU SUCK. YOU COULDN'T JUST DISCARD A WHOLE HUMAN BEING, RIGHT? - I'M A WHOLE HUMAN BEING! - BILL... WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR EACH OTHER, ROSE. IT MATTERS, WHAT WE DO TO PEOPLE-- WHAT WE SAY, OUR ACTIONS-- WE MAKE AN EFFECT ON PEOPLE. WE DON'T JUST LEAVE THEM OVER THE PHONE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, ROSE? DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? ( Cici screaming ) SHE TRIED TO BURN DOWN THE KITCHEN! LET HER GO! I SAID, LET HER GO! GET OUT OF HERE. TAKE THIS MANIAC AND GET OUT OF HERE, OR I'LL SHOOT YOU RIGHT WHERE YOU STAND. - I SWEAR TO GOD. - NO, YOU GET OUT OF HERE. I'VE GOT A GUN, TOO, AND I'LL SHOOT. - I MEAN IT. - YOU'RE NOT SHOOTING. - OH, NO? - NO. DON'T LOOK AT HER. SHE'S NOT GOING TO HELP YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO? WE LAUGH AT YOU. THAT'S RIGHT, HA HA. - RAY... - NO, NO, HONEY, IT'S OKAY. I'M NOT GOING TO LET HIM BOTHER YOU AGAIN. I MISS HIM. NO, NO, NO. YOU CAN'T BE SAYING THIS. I'M SORRY. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY? - I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. - Ray: CAN'T DO WHAT? WE LOVE EACH OTHER. I BOUGHT YOU THIS HOUSE. NOW YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT TO GO BACK WITH THIS LOSER? - NO! - IT'S YOUR TEMPER. I CAN'T HANDLE IT. I DIDN'T KNOW. I'M SORRY, I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT THIS HERE. - I'M GONNA GO PACK-- - NO, DON'T MOVE! YOU MOVE, AND I'LL SHOOT HIM! - RAY! - SHUT UP! SHUT UP! - I GOTTA FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. - YOU'RE NOT SHOOTING ANYBODY! SHUT UP. ( gun fires ) OH! OH! I... IT'S ALL HIM, RO. HE BROKE INTO OUR HOUSE, AND HE MEANT TO KILL US, DIDN'T YOU, BILL? OR, MAYBE THE GIRL... THE GIRL-- I MEAN, YOU LOOK AT HER, SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE ESCAPED FROM AN INSTITUTION. Rose: PUT DOWN THE GUN, RAY. THIS IS-- NO, NO, NO, RAY. JUST SHOOT US! SAVE US FROM OURSELVES. - JUST BE QUIET. I HAVE TO THINK. - NO, NO, NO. YOU TAKE ALL OF US DOWN TO THE BASEMENT, AND THAT WAY YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY BLOOD OVER YOUR BRAND NEW WOODEN KITCHEN FLOOR. FIRST, YOU SHOOT ME, GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY. THEN, YOU SHOOT BILL. THEN, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SHOOT ROSE. BUT, THEN AGAIN, GIVEN HER TRACK RECORD, ROSE WILL CHANGE HER MIND AGAIN AND WANT YOU BACK, 'CAUSE BILL IS DEAD. AND THEN YOU WON'T HAVE TO SHOOT HER AFTER ALL. AND THERE YOU GO. IT'S PERFECT. STRANGERS CAME TO THE HOUSE, YOU SHOT THEM. - RAY, SWEETHEART-- - SHE CALLED YOU "SWEETHEART" I'M TELLING YOU, RAY, SHE'S COMING AROUND! SHE'S COMING AROUND, I CAN FEEL IT! YOU STUPID BITCH, I SHOULD JUST SHOOT YOU RIGHT HERE. OH, GO AHEAD. POINT, AIM, FIRE. - BOOM! - STOP IT, CICI. NO. I WANT HIM TO SHOOT ME. I DON'T THINK HE CAN DO IT. I DON'T THINK HE'S ENOUGH OF A MAN. - GOD DAMN YOU-- - RAY! Rose: NO! NO! NO! ( gun clicks ) BILL. BILL? BILL. CICI? - BERNICE? - WHAT? - I'M SORRY. - WHAT? I'M SORRY TO WAKE YOU, BUT I HAVE TO LEAVE THE CAR FOR A MOMENT. I'LL BE BACK. WHERE'S ROSE? SHE'S IN OLMALIQ. OLMALIQ? IT'S A CITY IN UZBEKISTAN, NORTH OF AFGHANISTAN. WATCH THE CAR FOR A MINUTE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? MR. PINKERTON DETECTIVE. HEY, THERE. HOW'S THAT BEAUTIFUL GUN I SOLD YOU? IT DOESN'T WORK. IT SHOOTS A FLAG OUT. OOPS! I SOLD YOU THE WRONG GUN! I SOLD YOU THE FLAG GUN. TO TRADE IT IN FOR SOMETHING ELSE. NOT A GUN. OH, NO, NO. YOU BOUGHT A GUN, YOU'LL GET A GUN. IT'LL SHOOT REAL BULLETS AND EVERYTHING. - I PROMISE YOU. - SOUNDS GREAT, - BUT NO THANKS. - NOW, THERE'S A PINKERTON DETECTIVE - AROUND HERE-- - NO, NO, REALLY. I DON'T WANT A PINKERTON DETECTIVE. I WANT THAT. THAT'S A PIECE OF JUNK. I'LL TRADE YOU. WOW. HEY! OH, YOU THINK... YOU CAN JUST DUMP YOUR WIFE ON THE ROAD, BUY ME A TUBA AND MAKE EVERYTHING FINE? I DIDN'T DUMP MY WIFE ON THE ROAD. I TOOK HER TO THE AIRPORT. SHE HAD THE URGE TO FLEE, AND I HAD THE CAR. FOR ALL I KNOW, SHE'S ON HER WAY TO RIO, ENGAGED TO A FLAMENCO DANCER. BUT I THOUGHT SHE WANTED-- OKAY, SO YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST DUMP YOUR INSANE WIFE AT THE AIRPORT, BUY ME A TUBA, AND MAKE EVERYTHING FINE? NO, NOT AT ALL, I DIDN'T...
