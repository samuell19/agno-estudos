For the benefit of those of you who do not recognize what you are seeing... This is New York. Beautiful from the air, isn't it? Beautiful and exciting. A city of 8 million men and women who live and love... and sometimes fight each other to the death to get where they want to go... only to find out when they get there, is not where they want to be at all. This is my building, the Gifford Building. The Gifford Building houses the executive and home office staff of Gifford Motors... manufacturer of the car our advertising agency describes as... "luxury on wheels". It's seems to me that our advertising campaigns are designed to appeal to the snob in everyone. This is the car I manufacture: The Gifford. And here am I. My name is Gifford. This is the very newest Gifford. As you see, it is a convertible. It has been designed to convert your bank account into our dividends. In case you don't know enough to come in out of the rain, this car does. At the first drop of moisture, these plastic panels close automatically. I do not suggest that we're hoodwink in the public... but... this hood actually winks. It might interest you to know... this car... has 666 pounds of electrical equipment... connected by 8 miles of wiring. This little red job has only 7 and 1/2 mile of wiring. I shall ignore it. Yes... Gifford Motors is quite a company. The largest and most successful in its field. Everywhere in this country where wealth is centred... in the centre of that wealth is a district office of Gifford Motors. I inherited this highly profitable beehive from my father. He would be proud, I'm sure... to hear me say that I have increased his fortune five times over. Yes... it's a healthy, busy company... except in here. This is the office of the late and honestly lamented Phillip S. Briggs. As General Manager of Gifford Motors... Mr Brigg's salary was $ 125,000 yearly. Plus and outrageous expense account. He was worth every dollar of it. Nothing on earth could interfere with his devotion to his work. Not even his doctor. So now this chair is empty... I must fill that chair with another man of equal ability. I'm bringing to New York the three brightest men in our organization... I've also invited their wives, who will be observed closely and relentlessly. They will arrive here today... and primeval though the thought may be... May the best man win. Or should I say... the best wife win. Oh! There's a train! Yeah. Looks about the size of the one I gave Davey for Christmas. Yes. Now that you're in New York you'll get a chance to play with it. Now listen, Carol. While you're in New York, you just be Mrs. Talbot. You let me handle this my own way. Alright. I like being Mrs. Talbot. I know traffic's picking up. We must be getting close. - I can wait till we get to the hotel. - Yes but your ulcer, can't. You better take every opportunity you have to be nice to us. Five days of social life in New York. It may talk back to you. No matter what you think Liz. This isn't social. It's business. One of us is going to get that Briggs job. That's the reason Gifford invited us here, believe me. Have it your own way. "I hereby nominate you for the rat race". Please Liz. Remember your promise won't you? If Gifford knew we were separating... Alright. I'll play the loving wife, if I can remember the part. You were pretty good at it when you first started playing it. That was when I was your only wife. Before you decided you preferred to be married your job. Is it such a crime to work hard, to have some ambition? If it means killing yourself, yes. Oh! I wish you wouldn't make so much of it. So I got one small ulcer. - It will be over in a month. - Mm hmm. Look Liz... We coming back to New York, where we met, where we got married. For five days, couldn't we just pretend? Well, we're almost there. Look! You can see daylight. I saw daylight years ago. Good day, sir. Bill, this is awfully big for the two of us. I'll get lost in here. Couldn't we find something smaller? Well, what is this? Honey, this is on the company. Hey Katie... You're in New York? Aren't you excited. Well, I feel better up here than I did down in the street. You know, everytime I look up at those tall buildings, you're afraid they're going to fall on me. It's funny you never came here with me before. It's funny about being pregnant all the time. All the time? Oh no. I meant the first few years of our marriage. Besides, where can I go with three children screaming for attention all the time? Oh honey, you could have gone anywhere you wanted to. Well you know I wouldn't leave them with anyone but Mrs. Bruce, and we didn't get her until this year. You know something? I feel very very wicked being all alone in a hotel room with you. If you start feeling that way, we won't be alone long. I can understand how a poor lonely girl could be led astray in a suite like this. Hmm. Why are we here? - Are you kidding? - No, I'm serious. Why are we here? You read it in the company magazine yourself, honey. I'm one of three district managers who is... characterised with top of sales officially. Yes I know. But are they thinking of promoting you? Well now, what's wrong is being promoted, hmm? What I mean... promoted here to New York? - Well, what would you think of that? - Well, that's very terrible. Well then, let's not think about it, hmm? Come in! - Mr. Baxter? - That's right. - Flowers for Mrs. Baxter. - Oh thank you. Thank you. Hell! We're really late. - From the company? - Mr. Gifford, no less. "Mr. Gifford hopes Mr & Mrs Baxter will have a very pleasant stay in New York" as honored guests to the company. "We will do everything possible to make this a memorable occassion." Look at this schedule! It's like a timetable. - Mrs. Sidney Burns? - Yes. - Some flowers. - Thank you. - Here you are. - Thank you. This is where I belong. - You said something, honey? - Yes! Come here a minute, Jerry! I said "This is where we belong". Now look Carol, don't build yourself up for a letdown. We don't know for sure that this 3 card Monte game is for that Briggs job. Well I know. This is the first time, the expense account has included the wives. They don't make a tycoon out a man without being sure... his wife will qualify as Mrs. Tycoon. You think I'm up to it, Jerry? I'm never quite sure what you're up to. Well, I'm up to here with ambition for my husband. You'd like to have me get that job, would't you? Only if you wanted to. You've got to want things, Jerry. I've got to get dressed. Tonight maybe a fashion show and I don't want to finish last. Valet, please. - Bill? - Yeah. I'm beginning to feel like the plane trip has upset me. Oh no you don't Katie. You're not backing out of this party. They want to meet you Mr. Gifford and all of them. And besides, I didn't bring you to New York to show you off to only the bell boys and chambermaids. I like bell boys and chambermaids. Katie, what are you worried about now? Look! The dress. Why? That's your favorite dress. Yes, in Kansas City. - So what's the matter with it? - It doesn't go with orchids. You'd say it doesn't go with New York. What else have you got? Well, I ought to wear something with a plunging neckline. All right. The only thing I have with a plunging neckline is my nightgown. I used to work with Sid Burns years ago and it... He's my best customer. I just sold him... I can remember when station wagons were the cheapest models we carried. I wonder where the waiter is. You know, the hardest thing to get at a party is a glass of water. Interesting. About that report I sent him Monday. Now... I realise that this isn't the time or the place... You're correct. This isn't the time or the place. Could I get you a scotch and soda Mr Gifford? No, thanks Grove. You're much too valuable a man for that. - Oh Tony! - Yes sir? I know this affair is a necessary evil. But must it go on indefinitely? And where are the guests of honour? My schedule suggests that they be here at 6:30. You said to have everyone here ahead of them. Tony, when I said "everyone" I never include me. Sorry, Uncle Ernest. Now, you remember everything, darling. I'll try to do my very best to impress Mr Gifford and everybody. That's my girl. And when we get back to my non- apologising, I want you to remember that. Oh everything will be fine, but just remember... one Martini, no more. Yes, Bill. And don't say "yes sir" to Mr. Gifford, just address him as "Mr. Gifford." - Yes, Mr. Baxter. - And don't you worry. Don't worry, he says. Pretend to listen, one Martini, three sips... Be sure to mingle, don't relax, speak up, be quiet, "No Mr Gifford, Yes Mr Gifford". What do I do if somebody invites me to step out of my cage? Hmm? Oh Jerry, I forgot something. I'll have to go back to the room. Oh well, I'll wait here for you. No! You go ahead. I won't be a minute. - You'll need the key. - Thank you. Hello Burns. Good to see you again. I'm Beaker, remember? Oh yes! This is my wife. - Darling, this is Ed Baker. - Yes, I've heard his speak of you. Drink? Hey, Gerald and Mack! We've been waiting to congratulate you. Hi Jonesy, where is that good looking wife of yours? She'll be down in a minute. - How about a drink? - You've talked me into it. - Joe Wilkinson! Joe. How are you? - Hi Bill. How are you? I'd like you to meet Mrs. Baxter. This is Joe Wilkinson. - How do you do? - How do you do? She heard me talk about you so much, Joe, she practically knows you. - Oh yes, have you moved to St. Louis? - St. Louis? No darling. Mr. Wilkinson is General Sales Manager here in New York. The only Wilkinsons you've ever mentioned to me live in St. Louis. Oh no honey, those are the Wilkins. Could you use a drink, Mrs Baxter? - Oh yes I could. - Right over here. How do you do? I'm Tony Andrews. Oh! I'm Mrs. Talbot. I'm glad to see you. You will seeing a lot of me. Wherever you go and whatever you do in New York, I'll be along to pick up the tab. Well, I'll continue to be glad to see you. Sir, this is Mrs. Talbot. And I don't need to be told you're Mr. Gifford? You flatter me. I recognise you from your pictures. I make sure they flatter me too. I'm sorry honey. I didn't see you come in. You're the only one who didn't. Welcome to New York, Talbot. Hey, there is Mr. Gifford. Who's that with him? - Oh that must be Mrs. Talbot. - The little Texas darling. How did she get there? We made a blockade... She let us run interference for her. So I should say at the moment she's making a forward pass. I... I think I ought to say hello to Mr. Gifford. Or so should I, I suppose. Go ahead. We'll be there in a minute. I heard a lot about your husband. He's supposed to be one of the fastest man on the team. Thank you very much. I've heard some wonderful things about your husband too. It's the third Martini, do you mind? Oh! Why should I mind? Oh Bill does. He never likes me to have more than one. But I'm scared stiff. Are you drinking yourself stiff? Do I show it? Well, far be it from me to help the competition but... I'll let you in on an old trade secret. The minute the company wife takes her third jolt at one of these clam bakes... she's automatically classified as a dipsomaniac. Here. You better eat up. Thank you. I'm not going to try to match wit with you Mr. Gifford. I'm just going to listen and relax. I must say you relax very attractively. I'm a firm believer in relaxation, that's why I surround myself with hard workers such as your husband and... Oh hello Burns. Hello Baxter. Hi Mr. Gifford. - Mrs. Talbot, May I present Mr. Burns. - How do you do? - Talbot. - And Mr. Baxter. - How do you do? - How do you do? And will you gentlemen please identify Mrs. Burns and Mrs. Baxter for me. Well this is Mrs. Burns. - How do you do? - How do you do, Mrs. Burns. No! You're Mrs. Baxter. Oh yes. I'm Mrs. Baxter. How do you do? You must be Mrs. Burns. Well, when I came in, I was Mrs. Burns. Mrs. Talbot, one is these ladies is Mrs. Burns and the other is Mrs. Baxter. Wheels taken out later. Tony! Come here. Gentlemen! Gentlemen. I wish to present to you Mr. Talbot, Mr. Baxter and Mr. Burns... who, as a reward for their accomplishments, on behalf of Gifford Motors... have been brought to New York, tax deductible. And I wish to present their charming wives... who are also tax deductible and the prettiest set of tax deduction... that will pass through the Treasury Department this year. Let me suggest that when we are together, we will have a much better time... if you all forget that I am president of our company. I want particularly for you young ladies to enjoy this visit. And that can best be accomplished by your just being yourself. Thank you. That's just what I mean. That was a very handsome compliment you paid our wives, Mr Gifford. - Thank you. - I want to thank you on... ...behalf of the 3rd District. Yes, we enjoyed your speech very much Mr. Gifford. No one was listening to me thanks to this uninhibited young beauty. Oh I'm sorry sir... Oh no! Not sir. I mean, I'm sorry, Mr. Gifford. Please believe that I welcome your, shall I say, "comment" on my speech. I was slightly bored myself. But tell me, is this your first visit to New York? Splendid. You wiill have something to tell your children. You have two, I believe? Three? Huh huh. And I suppose they are the most wonderful children in the world. I knew you were going to say that. Here you are darling. Water... Yes. Pinch your nose. Drink from the opposite side of the glass upside down. That's right. Do you dance? Mmm. But if you don't mind let's sit this one out. I'm beginning to understand why your husband has been so successful. Some companies seem to regard the wives as liability. Some wives are. Only if they're married to the wrong man. Any man would be the wrong man for some wives. Then he would be the wrong man for that wife. I know we're dancing, but isn't our conversation getting somewhat circular? You think she's making a play for Gifford. Oh, let's be charitable. Let's just say she's interested in that big job for her husband. So now that you're here. How do you like New York? Oh I think it's a wonderful place to visit. Oh now, don't say you wouldn't like to live here? Oh! There is not much chance of that ever happening. You seem to be discounting that clever husband of yours. What do you mean? Well, he has a rather impressive record, hasn't he? And if Mr. Gifford should decide to advance him... Oh you don't suppose that... the company is thinking of bringing him to New York someday? It is not impossible. You don't mean that, do you? You just hold the right thoughts and keep your fingers crossed. Keep my fingers crossed? Well, that's the way to get your wish, isn't it? Talbot, your wife dances beautifully. Your wife dances beautifully. Your wife dances beautifully. Bill... for Kansas City! - I'm sorry. - Go easy darling. No, I'm alright. I'm just trying to drink with my fingers crossed. Is that a local custom in Kansas City? No, Mr. Gifford. I was just making a wish. Let's hope it comes true. Well that surely depends on you. Anything in my power. Well, I just wish you wouldn't give Bill a job in New York. Katie! Really? That's what you're wishing? What... You see Mr. Gifford. Kathy doesn't know. I didn't tell her. Didn't tell her what, Baxter? - Well, I mean I didn't... - What didn't you tell me, dear? Well nothing honey. Let's just skip the whole thing. Can I say something? They say Mrs. Baxter, that if you tell your wishes, it doesn't come true. Of course that's merely a superstition... but I guess we better let the future take... Please let's change the subject. My name is Katie Baxter and I have three children. All of them are much smarter than I am. Excuse me. - Katie darling! - No! You stay here please. Just a minute Baxter. May I say something? I'm sorry Mr. Gifford. I think my wife needs me now. Oh honey. You just can't depend on me. Alright. Just did. That's why you're so wonderful. And that's one of the reason I love you. - You're completely unpredictable. - Hmm. You can't predict what I'll do but you sure can predict that I'll do it. Well in my opinion, Mrs. Baxter certainly knocked her husband out of the running. I wasn't referring to Mrs. Baxter. Just what does that mean? I saw you working on Gifford didn't I? Jerry, you won't go after the job, you even acted as if you didn't want it. Sure I want it. So does Burns, so does Baxter. That's just it. And probably three fairly nice guys. Under normal conditions I'm sure we'd like each other very much. But now we've got to perform for the masters. Got to try to catch each other off balance with one smug little show of superiority that will knock out the other two. Why this three ring circus? I don't care about the others. I would just try and prove to Gifford he wouldn't be making a mistake if he chose you. Carol! You let me prove that. But darling don't you see... If I did show him a little attention it was only to encourage his interest in you for the job. Now listen. I'll get to the top... but I'll get there on what I've got, not what you've got. Liz I want to thank you. You had me worried a couple of times, but... all and all, you were a pretty swell wife tonight. - Thanks. - I'm sure you made Gifford believe it. You really did a solid job. Do you mind if I comment on your job? That Gifford seems to be a very sharp cookie. He might notice that you are trying too hard. Just a little too hard. I'm trying too hard? What about the Talbot woman? You answered you own question. She's a woman. Prime Texas beef with New York steaks in exactly the right places. What's that gotta do with it? You'll find out. Poor Katie Baxter, she just couldn't do anything right. Her husband is probably the best man for the job too. What about me? You'll do just as well for a while, till the job kills you. I like that Bill Baxter. I like the way he left Gifford flat because his wife needed him. I bet they've worked it out, so they're pretty happy. With him it doesn't have to be all job and no family. Alright... so by your standards, I'm a failure as a husband. Is this what you want? Get away from me. I'm sorry, Liz. So am I. Bill... - Bill...? - Hmm. Why always what I said is so terrible? Which one? Well you know when I said: "Mr. Gifford, my wish was, that you wouldn't give Bill a job in New York". Well, you know Katie, it may seem strange to you but. New Yorkers like New York. Yeah. No. It was more than that. You know, even those people from Texas and Philadelphia looked as though I had dropped a bomb. And the look on your face! Katie. You remember Phil Briggs, the General Manager? The man who died. - Yah. - Yes. Well, his job is still open. You mean they may offer that job to you? Oh why didn't you tell me that in Kansas City before we came here? You know why. Yeah, I'd been scared to death and I wouldn't have come. That's just it. Hey, wouldn't this look nice on you? - You mean in public? - Sure. Bill... You wouldn't want the children to see me in that. It would show you off beautifully. Goodnight. That's the kind of dress Mrs. Talbot wears. Tell me. Did her neckline plunge enough to suit you? Better ask Gifford. He had the view. I'm gonna give you some more money in the morning. Good. And you get yourself something that'll make Gifford look at you for a change. Bill, you don't want that job, do you? Well it's just... I'd like him to think I'm the best man for it... and you're the best wife for it. Had me scared for a minute! - Katie? - Yes. Come here. Now let's get this straight. Here and now. I don't need the Briggs job to make me happy, but I do need you. Oh Bill. Do you know that's the first time in our life you've ever said you need me. Just like a play I saw on television. No! Two plays, the same night. I love you. And I love you. But I'm going to sleep. It's after midnight. - Goodnight sweetie. - Goodnight. I heard you're the best man for the job... and I'd like to see Mr. Gifford offer it to you. Oh? But I'm glad you want to stay in Kansas City. That's the Public Library. Those lions look superior, don't they? They remind me of somebody. Oh I know. It looks like Mr. Gifford. Very discerning of you, Mrs. Baxter. Mr. Gifford has been accused of posing for them. Wasn't it considerate of Mr. Gifford to furnish us with such a tactful and entertaining escort. We wouldn't know about that. Oh no, please ladies. I am not worth it. Mrs. Talbot can use you for practice until... she gets the chance with that old string bean Gifford again. Don't repeat that to your uncle. He is still his uncle's advisor as I'm concerned. Together with his aunt too. His uncle happens to be Mr. Gifford. Mr. Andrews. If you get near a river would you please stop. I'd like to jump in. Katie, you're getting the roof of your mouth sunburned. This is the United Nations. Those are the flags of all the countries that belong to it. Some of them haven't been here ever since the plant opened. My father knew every one of his workers by name. - Yes. He used to call me Sid. - What's that? - I said your father used to call me Sid! - Really Mr. Burns. You should have told you worked your way up from the plant. Yes sir, I am. How on earth did you ever stand the noise? PROVING GROUND No matter how good the plans of the engineers look and do, this is the final test. Whenever we brought out a new model... I couldn't get Briggs to listen to what I had to say about it. The only man he wanted to talk to was that test driver. He was a great General Manager. I think he was the best informed man I ever met especially about people. I remember when he came down to Texas he knew everything about everybody. He even knew that I had a collection of early Colt revolvers. That was his special trick and he made it pay off handsomely. He called it his "particular brand of enterprise". How did it work? Well, he had a huge file pertaining to the various sports and hobbies of men. When he met you, he'd bring up your hobby as they were of his own. His best deal was made with an amatuer mountain climber... who never knew that Briggs got dizzy, he stood on a thick carpet. You don't approve of Brigg's technique, Baxter? No. In the first place it's based on deceit and... I don't think that big business is built on personal relationships any more. This is where they dream of ideas for the car of the future. There is nothing about an automobile that we're not working on. Have any of you gentlemen ever thought of an improvement that could sell more Gifford than we're selling now? Well, if we could cross a Gifford with a helicopter, it might help solve the parking problem. We tried that once. We gave it up. But... step over here gentlemen. Oh... Jones. Johnson... - Or is it Robinson? - My name is Jabernatsky, Mr. Gifford. Oh! Of course yes, Jabernatsky. Show us what you're planning for us. How soon are we gonna get that, Mr. Gifford? As soon as we can get the cost down to where it's practical. I could sell a thousand of those cars a week. Yeah! So could I. I wouldn't put that on me, Mr. Gifford. If you have a quality product, you don't have to pretend to be mountain climber to make a sale. You seem better in criticizing a man who can defend himself only in the sales. I wasn't criticizing a man, I was criticizing a philosophy. Baxter, just what do you think are all the qualifications of an executive? Well, I think the first responsibility of an executive is to operate his company for the benefit of the public. We're talking about a private enterprise. You sound like a public utility. This is the room I've been looking for. Beautiful color combination. I can understand why you brought us in here. Not at all. I've been looking for a place to sit down. You haven't had much to say, Talbot. You learn more listening. I've heard what Baxter said, what Burns said. Both made a lot of sense to me. I'd go along with both of them. Well, haven't you anything to contribute? Nothing I can be sure would be useful. Why won't you let me be the judge of that. Sit down gentlemen. Well, I think... any man in a top job has to have everything that Baxter and Burns mentioned. And a little extra. What extra? - I wish I knew. - Aren't you being somewhat cryptic. No, because I honestly don't know what it is... except that a big man who functions in a big job has to have it. Personally I call it "X plus". X plus? Yes. "X" because no one knows just what it is... and "plus" because it's a little more than the ordinary person has. And you can't define it. Well, it's that quality that makes a champion... A star, a leader, a great man. I think we all recognize it when we meet someone who has it. - Example. - Eisenhower has it. Churchill has it. All of the greats... Edison, Ford, Babe Ruth. Anyone who belongs to the top has some of it. How about yourself? Do you think you have it? Well, there are a lot of days when I'm sure I haven't... and then there are days when I'm positive I have. How can I be sure whether or not you have this "X plus" Talbot? Or Baxter, or Burns? Mr. Gifford, if you have it... I think you will know whether any of us have it or not. Possibly. Well I... feel I know all of you a little better now. Which leaves me even more confused. Let's say we go to lunch. Hi. Hi. How did you get along with Mr. Gifford? I haven't the slightest idea. You didn't say or do anything to offend him? I wouldn't know. What about the others? Old Burns delivered his pet little speech. But Baxter wouldn't 'yes' him. He gave him an argument. I bet you made a wonderful impression. You know I like that Baxter. I like the way he spoke up. Sure would be great to have an honest General Manager with guts. That's why you should be General Manager. Jerry, I have a confession to make. I fell in love today. How's that? I fell in love today. Desperately. Oh! With that... young Mr. Andrews? No, with New York. Oh Jerry! This is the most fabulous, exciting, thrilling city! Oh! We just have to be here. Oh, this is where all the most important people in the world are. Carol, could it be that you are just a bit of a social climber? Well, if I am, then New York is Mount Everest. - Suppose it doesn't work out? - Oh it just has to. I wonder what would happen if you had to make a choice between New York and me? Oh darling. As if there could be any choice. Why can't I have you both. We're on our own for dinner tonight. Tony suggested the Pavillon. You better shave. The Pavillon? - I never heard of it. - You will. You know Liz. I'd say I came out on top. What brings you to this modest conclusion? Well.. Baxter reeled off a lot of high sounding stuff and all Talbot said was... a General Manager ought to be a little better than the next fellow. Made it a perfect setup for anybody that can make sense. And I... Aren't you forgetting about your ulcer? Well, you asked me a question, I was just trying to answer it for you. If you're not interested... Forgive me. For the moment I forgot about the job and was interested in you. You think I'm a conceited heel, don't you. No. Well I do. Now that I thought about what I've been saying. - How is your ulcer? - Terrible. The food of the platter is cooked in steel pots for iron stomachs. If you accomplish something for yourself, I guess the suffering is worth it. Sure. You're right, Liz. All in all, I'd say I had a very good day. I don't plan to be dazzling Mr. Gifford with my personality but, I'm getting some place. Don't you think so? Oh now please. Liz, I'm not being conceited now! I'd like your honest opinion, as an outsider. Sure... As an outsider, I can see you're getting some place... Every minute you're getting closer to the job that's going to kill you and every minute you're getting closer to the end our marriage. You're asking for compliments from me. All in all I'd say you had a wonderful day. Congratulations. Oh Liz wait. Aren't we having dinner together? How would I know your plans. Where are you going? Where do you think I'm going? As an outsider I'm going outside. Now where did I put the phone...? Bill. When are you going to ask me? - What about honey? - About this afternoon. I did it again. I made cracks about Mrs. Talbot and Mr. Gifford that wasn't vey nice. In fact, if anyone made them about me, I'd start swinging. And then about the charming sitting right there as big as life is Mr. Gifford's nephew. Hmm. I didn't know that either. Well... if you wanted Mr. Gifford to think that we're the best couple for the job... I proved to anyone who might have the slightest doubt, that is the candidate for Mrs. General Manager, I am positively not it. Well darling, compared to me, you're a career diplomat. Oh! What did you do? - I spoke my mind. - Good. I don't think Mr. Gifford liked what I said. Well, I think that's wonderful. But at least he knows I'm no yes-man. See... Not wanting the job, you could speak your mind. You could be perfectly honest. And I will bet you that he has more respect for you than he has for any of those other fellows. - Yes dear. - And I will bet you... - Oh dear... - What? You don't suppose he has so much respect for you he'd make you take the job? Darling, between the two of us, I think we can succeed in failing. Yeah, I think so. What's on the schedule for tonight? Hey! We're on our own! Oh, that is wonderful. I have a suggestion. Why don't we have dinner right here in the suite and call up Kansas City and talk to the children? Oh great. Now while I order dinner, you put one of those New York gowns you bought today. Oh I didn't buy one. But I promise you, I will go out tomorrow and really shop for something. - Well, you be sure you do. - I will. Hey listen. Why don't you go shopping with that... Mrs. Burns? She seems to have a pretty sharp eye for clothes. - Well, thank you for the suggestion... - Well, that's okay. And now for our big evening... While I order cocktail and a menu setup, you put on a slinky negligee, huh? I didn't bring a slinky negligee with me. If you want me to slink, you'd have to enjoy it in this bathrobe. Well, we'll put the lights out. I'll use my imagination. Hello! Room Service. Room Service please. Will you join me, mother? I have a guest coming. I'm going to wait for him. Oh... And who might that be? Someone I'm very fond of... I haven't seen him for a long time. Mother. That sounds very romantic. No. I'm related to him... by marriage. My mother and father's marriage. It's your uncle. He must be coming to see me. He wants to know what I think of the three wives. Well. What did you think of them? Strictly no contest. For a General Manager's wife, one of them is so imminently suitable, but... Don't mention the name of your choice, Tony. I don't wish to be prejudiced against her. Ernest, you look just as I remembered you. I hope there's no trouble I'm dropping in for a cocktail. And I will have a cocktail. Coming? It's no trouble, it's just a bit of a shock. Well, I was coming back from Long Island. While crossing the bridge, I happen to look down, see your house... - Thought of you... - Wait a minute. That look you have... isn't a came here for cocktail look. A very discerning woman even in your riper years. - Should I resent that for you, mother? - Down boy. You know about the company's guests of honor? "The Briggs Job Caper". Mother! You've been watching television again. I get around. Have you picked your man for the job yet? No such luck. Right man wrong wife, right wife wrong man. The wife will represent the company at certain times, almost as much as the husband. And I know I shall never complete efficiency from a man who spends his nights... dreaming about his wife falling down three flights of stairs. Well, I should think if might keep him on his toes. According to your own statement, none of these couples seems to fit your standard. Why not look for someone else? Well, these are the best men available. - And you know, my dear... - Ernest. Just what is it you want me to do? I was planning a little dinner Thursday night. I was hoping you'd be my hostess. And keep your eyes open. Ernest, it's very difficult to judge a woman on the basis of one dinner, one dress. Finding out if she's really housebroken takes a weekend. Is Castle Hill open? Yes, skeleton staff, only five people. But I can send down the service from New York. Evelyn, it's very nice of you to do this for me. Well, I don't know. It just means I have to cancel appointments... with my dentist, my doctor, my dressmaker, my masseuse. One luncheon... Evelyn! You shouldn't let your life get into such confusion. A weekend in the country will do you good. It is very fortunate that I dropped in. It will be interesting to see which wife you wil nominate. I hope our minds meet. Au revoir dear. Tony. When it comes to women I'm not sure Earnest thinks with his mind. There's one wife in particular. He seems very much attracted to her. I hope he hasn't reached that age. All men reach... that age. Well I guess we got the same idea. If you're referring to good food, yes. Mind if I sit down? You're still my husband. You have sitting rights. This place hasn't changed much, has it? You haven't seen the menu. On your salary of twelve years ago we'd be outside with our noses pressed against the window. Everything has gone up since then. - Listen when you left the hotel... - Are you gonna sit here? - Yes, if you don't mind. - It's alright. He's my husband. You know my wife and I used to eat dinner here almost every night years ago? - You want a cocktail? - No thanks. We sat right at that table over there. - No cocktail, huh? - No thanks. I would say there was a waiter here by the name of Tomaso. Is he still around? - Yeah, he's the boss now. - Is that right? I'd like to talk to him. - I'll tell him. - Thanks. - No cocktail? - No. Well guess we... had some wonderful times here, didn't we? - Yeah. - Great times. What happened to us? We got married. Darling, I don't mean that. Did you wish to see me? - Hello! Hello! Hello. - Well it's Tomaso. - Can hardly recognise you. - The food is too good. - How are you? - Just fine. - You haven't been in lately. - It's been about twelve years. - Say why not? - We're living in Philadelphia now. - We're married. - To each other. Well, I remember. You was married here. Right at that table. We had our wedding dinner there. - Liz, have you ordered yet? - No. Why don't we have that same dinner tonight? You remember, Tomaso. It was a dollar a quarter dinner. Red ink included. So same dinner exact. Right here. $4.50, wine extra. Giovanni! ...spaghetti, ravioli, two appetizers, one with extra chilli pepper. Okay. - Hey, how many kids have you got there? - Two. - What's the matter? - Well, we're not complaining. Maybe this is gonna give you ideas. A toast... To love. To love. Just like your wedding night. You see? I remember. - Double order of pepper just for you. - Thanks, Tomaso. I'm going you serve you myself now. You take spaghetti and you take the ravioli. No, Tomaso, it's just the other way around. Of course. What's the matter with me? Coming right out. Sid. You can't eat that. Well I guess you're right. Twelve years ago I could eat it. Twelve years ago I was at the bottom of the ladder and on top of the world. I didn't know I was well off. You still don't. Liz, I was so miserable and lonely after you left the hotel. The I thought about Tony's and... I guess I came here to feel sorry for myself. What brought you here? It brings people back to the place they were happier... whether it's back to the scene of the crime. You explain it. I don't expect you to believe this, but... I love you very much. There's something else you love more. Look... if I forget all about the Briggs' job... if I really settle down for some home life, would you give me another chance as a husband? - No. - Why not? Well it... in the first place, that wasn't an offer. It's a question. And the second place, the two of us being back here together tonight makes... one of your loves seem to outweigh the other... at the moment. No! No, I'm serious. I'll prove it to you. You've said that before. Well doggone. If this is our wedding dinner anniversary and I'm going to celebrate it! Sid. Sit up. Oh murder! It's murder. You knew this was going to happen. Why did you have to eat that Italian dynamite? I'm not complaining. By the way... Did I thank you for a wonderful evening? Thank you too. Pardon me. Mistake. MACY'S, the store with MORE. It's smart to be Thrifty. Macy's. Well no, I don't know. This is William Baxter, of the Gifford motor car company. And I had a message to call on Mr. Kleinert. Yeah, I'll hold on. - Hi darling. - Hello sweetie. Where have you been? Shopping. Feel I've found the most wonderful thing that you're just going to be crazy about. Oh that's great. You can take a look at that. What is it? We're invited to Mr. Giffords place in Long Island for the weekend. And we're leaving tomorrow afternoon on his yacht. - For the weekend? - Yeah, isn't it... Oh hello. Yes, Mr. Kleinert. Oh I see. I know I can come over right away if you like. Will Talbot and Burns be there? I see. No, no no. I'll come right over. Thank you Mr. Kleinert. What do you know. I have to go over to the advertising agency right away. Is anything wrong? Anything wrong? Honey, this is wonderful. I just tossed out a few suggestions this morning... and now Gifford wants them to go over all the advertising layouts with me. With me, honey. Not Talbot, not Burns, just me. What do you suppose it means? It means that I'm way out in front. It means that I may be the new General Manager. Honey this may be the big break that... Bill... Just kidding. You do want the Briggs job, don't you? I wouldn't be human if I didn't, honey. It's the toughest job in the whole organization. Of course I want it. Okay Bill, then I want you to have it. If you want it, then I want it too. And if my ideas for that campaign are really good... and if you're knocking for a loop this weekend... - You got that dress, huh? - No, not that one... Well, tell me about it later, honey. I'll see you in about an hour. Bill! Hey Bill! You forget something! Good luck. Hi! Whatever it is, good luck from me too. Liz, have you heard about the weekend? Yeah. I didn't expect to have that thrown at me. I had to go out and buy some clothes. What did you get? Evening gown, a little cocktail outfit. - Oh, I did something terrible. - Like what? Well Bill gave me money to buy some clothes and I have practically spent it all. - What did you get? - A very expensive barbecue. Katie, they're not wearing barbecues this season. But it's something he's always wanted and said he couldn't afford. What an idiotic wonderful thing to do. He'll think I bought something sensational... for the trip. You know, with Mr. Gifford. And what I want to talk to you about is you see. Bill suggested that I ask you to help me to shop. Why me? Well, he said you have a very sharp eye for clothes. That's the compliment that has been seen to pay all the wives but their own. Well, it's important to Bill how I look on this trip. And what's important to him is important to me. Well, let's see what we can do about it. Tell me. How much do you have left with Bill's money? 73 dollars. - 73 dollars? - Uh huh. What do you actually need? Well, I need an evening gown for sure and then I need something not quite so formal. And a fairy godmother. Alright, I accept the nomination. First, let's consider your assets: 73 dollars and a good figure. I've got it. There's only one answer to that. I hope. Come on. Where are we going? Well it's a joint where they sell a lot of leftovers. If your're lucky sometimes you can pick up an exclusive that's been worn by a model. - Never heard of a store like that? - It's not a store it's a battlefield. Myrtle! Myrtle! Beg your pardon but I just took this off the rack. You did, hey. Well I had my hands on this first. - I don't wish to argue with you, no offense. - Lady... I warn you. Keep your hands off of this dress. Oh! Shut your mouth! Mother! Mother, this is just what we're looking for. Oh good. What size is it? - Well eight. Just right. - Yes. Did you see the new rack they just brought in? Myrtle! - Hey Liz, come here. Look at this! - No more. I quit. Please Liz. Look lady, we found a cocktail dress. Let's not press our luck. I know, but this one looks unusual. Well, it just looks familiar. We've been over that rack 3 times. Well, we may be reaching for the moon, but I know I saw this in "Harper's" or "Vogue." Probably saw it in a comic book. Hey where did you get that? On this rack, it's only $59.95. That's a Maurice original! Maurice who? Katie, when the cheapest dress you make is $500, you only need one name. Well I knew there was something about it! Oh, yes, I remember now. It's something terrible. It's a size 16. Well buy it and let's get out of here. But I'm an 8. Doesn't matter Katie. Maybe it's a smaller 16. Well try it on. Okay. Sadie, where's that pink coat? I went out and bought a peach dress to match it. Now I can't find it anywhere. Look! You can't buy that. That's the dress I wore in here! Myrtle! Look... Oh sorry. Look! I can walk around in this without moving it. It's no use Liz, they don't make alterations. Well, I now confess. In my glamorous past I was a fitter at Macy's. I make alterations. You know, I think you're the most wonderful person I've ever known. Is this where you got your dress for the weekend party? - No. - Why not? I haven't got the brains to do this for myself. Come on. Let's give him the money and get out of here. Okay. Myrtle! Myrtle! I'm feeling a litte woozy. Oh! We just left the dock. I think I'll go and lie down in that little room downstairs. Katie, sailors don't say downstairs, they say below. I am not what you call a good sailor, so I'm going downstairs. You know something, Liz? No pain. Good. You had nothing the other night to last a month. I think the main reason is that I've quit worrying. As far as I'm concerned that Brigg's job can go jump. You still don't believe me, do you? Well, you haven't said anything to Mr. Gifford yet. Well, I don't have to. Just by not trying, I can eliminate myself. That way I won't offend him. It would offend him if you tell him your health wouldn't permit you to take the job.? Well, he might not believe it... Think I was a quitter. I don't want to lose what I've got. Why, this is as easy as driving a car. I could sail this boat all the way to England. We won't try for England this afternoon. Hey! I'm locked in! Hey somebody? - That sounds like Katie. - Yeah. Hey somebody! Help! That is Katie. I'd better go look for her. Mr. Gifford. We're getting off course. Well... then you better take over, Captain. I'm sorry. Oh! That was fun! Even getting off course can be fun. Well, glad you got here before I drowned. Well if you get into more trouble, that'll be a very interesting life. - Oh! There you are, Evelyn. - I heard you got out. I'm glad you're here. This is your hostess Mrs. Andrews. My sister, Tony's mother. Ernest, don't explain me, just introduce me. Mr. and Mrs. Baxter, from Kansas City. - How do you do? - Kansas City. How nice. - Mrs. Burns, from Philadelphia. - I love Philadelphia. How do you do? - And Mr. and Mrs. Talbot. - How do you do? From Texas, ma'am. Dallas. I knewTexas would speak for itself. I believe we've met. You ladies are not what I expected. I thought you'd be like some Helen Hokinson characters, all girdled and bosomy. You're right about the girdle. I've planned some tea for us girls. We dine rather late here. But first let me show you to your rooms. You might want to freshen up. You gentlemen must want to freshen up too. I'll show you to the bar. Too bad you had to see the place at this time of the year. In the spring the garden's are all pink and white and frivolous. Oh I think it's just beautiful now. Trips are always perfect. Litte perilous for Katie. Mrs. Baxter, I can't keep my eyes off that dress. Did you bring that from Kansas City? Oh no! I bought this in New York. - Really? Where? - You wouldn't believe it... - It's a Bonwit Teller's exclusive. - Oh! Bownit's! Well I didn't get it at Bonwit. Mrs. Burns knew that... Well, I've been admiring your dress, Mrs. Andrews. Italian, isn't it? Yes, er... You were just going to tell me... Oh well. This is a place where they sell dresses that models have worn. - You'd be surprised the prices... - What surprises me... is you having the courage to do a thing like that. We are all so snobbish about clothes. Mrs. Burns. Would you take me there sometime? Mrs. Andrews, you are the most. Ooh! What does that mean? Oh that means you're not a bit like Mr. Gifford. I wonder what's keeping Mrs. Talbot? Oh thank you. These are marvelous. Are they hard to make? No. You take one good cook and put her in the kitchen. Oh! I'm sorry I'm late, Mrs. Andrews. Actually I came down early and Mr. Gifford was kind enough to show me the garden. I don't blame him. You're a very pretty young lady. In fact you're all so young, you make my bones ache. I just hope I look as good as you do when I'm your... Please go on. I don't resent that kind of a compliment. - Cream? - No thank you. Well, what I meant to say was, I think you're so wonderfully preserved. Thank you. Oh... oh! My dear. Did you burn yourself? And that beautiful dress while we take care of this right away. Mrs. Burns, can you play hostess for a few minutes. With pleasure. I get clumsier every year! It's a good thing I'm out here, where I can't get at your best furniture. Come this way. Isn't it a shame that Katie spilled tea on her dress. A shame but not a surprise. What I meant was, she's upstairs getting chummy with Mr. Gifford's sister. Should that concern us? Well Mrs. Andrews is an important stockholder. She could have a hand in picking the new General Manager. Oh! Mr. Gifford makes his own decisions. Besides, I'm sure, we both are aware that we happen to be living in a man's world. You don't have any children, have you, Mrs. Talbot? No. You know, I think if you and Mr. Talbot had children... you might realise that a man like your husband would be working more for his children than for you. You wouldn't mind that, because they'd be your children too and... you'd know, you gave them to him. That's why Mrs. Talbot, it isn't a man's world. It's a woman's world. Have a cookie, cookie. Thank you. Thank you, Mary. You know something? That robe is never going to be happy on me again. It won't take Mary long to iron out your dress. Gosh! All this trouble and then having to leave your guests. Trouble? It's a relief. I'm always nervous at first with strange people. You're just saying that to make me feel good because that's the way I am. Oh! I'm so nervous that I'm going to say or do something wrong. Yes, I sensed that, the moment I met you. Not that you are going to do something wrong, but but you were all keyed up trying not to. Nobody would ever believe that you were nervous. Well I've learnt not to show it. You're going to have to learn that as your husband goes more and more successful. You're going to have to learn a great many things. What kind of things? I mean besides being a charming hostess to strange people, the way you're doing now. Aren't you actually trying to ask... what it would like for you if you were the wife of Gifford Motors General Manager? Oh oh. - Yes. - Well. In the first place if your husband becomes more important to his company he'll have to give it more of his time and attention. That's at your expense, of course. And you must convince him, you're perfectly content. Oh but I'm used to being alone. You know Bill travels a lot as the District Manager. And of course I have the children. They're growing up. You wouldn't have so much time for the children. You'd have social obligations. You'd have to be saying... nice things you didn't mean to people who didn't believe you. And at all times conduct yourself with the poise and dignity... expected from the wife of so important a man. Even if you felt like kicking up your heels and screaming. - Mmm. - I know. Years ago I served my time as the wife of the General Manager of Gifford Motors. I'm not trying to discourage you... I'm trying to prepare you to face the future with some idea of what it's all about. I had better get back to the other guests. You won't have to wait long for your dress. Well thank you for everything and especially for telling me what the General Manager's wife has to do. Now that I know what to expect, I'll do it. You're quite a girl. See Bill, that's my husband he's the best man for the job and Mr. Gifford is bound to recognize that. You do love your husband, don't you? - Oh, yes I do. - That's good. Because the man who gets the job must have a wife who loves him very much. Everything on this wall were shot by my grandfather. He hunted in the west when the west was still wild. These are things shot by my father. He went to Africa with Roosevelt. That would be Roosevelt I... in 1909. I think you gentlemen will find this a very interesting collection. These are specimens from all over the world: India, Africa... South America, Australia... - Is this your wall, Mr. Gifford? - No! It's my mother's. Mother had a deadly aim. This are my wall. I have learned to let other people have the thrill of adventure and hardship... and... hard work. Which brings me, gracefully, to my subject. All of you are bright enough to know that I am now on a hunting trip... and one of you gentlemen will be my victim. Each of you must also be bright enough to know that your wife has been under observation. Well, if she can properly represent the Gifford Motor company, it's part of my decision, but... she must also have one other important qualification... which will have be your decision. Your wife must never compete with the company. If there's a choice between your work and your wife, your work must come first. Do you agree, all of you? Well I don't, Mr Gifford. If a man's job and his home life interfered with each other, there's something wrong with the man. - Or the wife. - Possibly but... If you'd expect me to marry my job at the expense of my legal wife, I'm not your man. I appreciate your frankness, Baxter. How about you, Talbot? Mr. Gifford, I didn't come here to ask for this job. I'm not asking for it now. Mrs. Talbot and I were invited to New York so you could look us over. You've been looking us over. You mentioned a certain condition for this job. I have one too. Regardless of Mrs. Talbot... If I don't qualify for this job personally... then I don't want it. Burns... Under the conditions I have outlined, do you think you could handle this job? Handle it? Mr. Gifford, I'd give my eye teeth for the chance. Ernest. - Aren't you men resting for dinner? - Of course. We dine at 8. You will have my decision after dinner. We're going to serve cocktails. I hope you'll be down in about half an hour. We have an excellent cook. I thought mabybe you could use this before you go downstairs. Thanks. You've got plenty of time. - That's new, isn't it? - Mm hmm. That looks great. You too of course. Sid, have you been drinking? You know better than that. My ulcer has been having a field day again. Why? Why what? Is it because you'd said you'll turn down the Brigg's job if it's offered? Liz, I can't turn it down. I have the chance this afternoon to tell Gifford I didn't want it. I couldn't. Why not? Liz, when they took me off the line and made me a foreman, I knew I was going to get some place. When they took me out of the factory and started me selling cars I... I knew couldn't stop trying until I got to the top. And then with Gifford this afternoon laying it right at my lap asking me if I could handle it, the top job in the company, I couldn't say no. I just couldn't. Liz, I... I honestly think Gifford has picked me. Well, congratulations. You're getting the one and only thing you want. No! Lo Liz. That's not true. If I lose you and the kids, I lose everything that really matters to me. I know that, I try to do something about it, but something just keeps pushing me on. Can't you see Liz? Yes, I see. Baxter said one thing today that made sense. He... He said that a man's job and his home life ought to be separate. One... One shouldn't interfere with the other. I could make it like that with us, Liz. Baxter could make it that way, not you. Darling... No, I guess not. Alright, I'll go see Gifford right now and tell him I don't want it. No! I understand you better now than I ever did before. If I made you give up this job, you'd always resent me. That's something I wouldn't want. So if... Gifford gives you the job... Take it, Sid. I'll stick. Do you mean that, Liz? I mean it. I don't look so bad in black. I'll be there to bury you. Because that's what it means. And it... It must mean too that I love you. I don't know why else I'd do it. Liz, I... Please get out of the room, will you, Sid? Wait for me downstairs. Okay. Hey, Katie darling. I've got to shave! Come on. Aren't you ready yet? Just about. Close your eyes! Okay. Come out, come out, wherever you are. Now! Katie! Katie, you're beautiful. Honey, you're absolutely beautiful. What a gown! Would you suppose I can get Mr. Gifford to unglue his eyes from Mrs. Talbot? If you do, I'll break his jaw. Bill... Would it come as a terrible shock to you if I turn out to be smart? Katie, what have you done now? Well, this afternoon I spilled a whole cup of tea all over myself. - Oh that's alright. - Oh! This time I did it on purpose. Why did you do that? Well, I wanted a chance to talk to Mr. Gifford's sister. And it worked. Why? Well, they say she has a lot of influence with Mr. Gifford. And she told me things. She said the General Manager's wife have to do. And she said she was doing it to prepare me to face the future. So... looks like you've been elected. What kind of things then? Oh... things like how to be one of the social circle and... and how to get used to not seeing so much of my husband. Well, how would you feel about that? Oh I feel fine. I think it would be just wonderful if you were the General Manager! Honey, you said that a bit too loud. - Too loud? - Yeah. What if I said I don't want the job? You don't... want... Oh Bill, anything you want! I mean, anything you don't want if you really don't want. Katie darling, listen. For two hours we've been finding out the lowdown on what this job really means. And right now, boy, Kansas City looks good to me! Oh, I've never been so homesick for any place in my whole life. Well... I've got to get ready. Oh Bill! If Mr. Gifford did give you the job, could you turn it down? Well I don't know. I feel pretty silly after all I said about how I run things, but... I haven't got it yet... and I believe in his good judgement. Oh! Please don't say that. No, I know you'll get the job! I know. Put on that dress you brought from Kansas City! I will not. He must have said something! - What? - I said he must have said something. Oh... Same thing he's been saying ever since we got to New York. He likes to watch people squirm. He also like to see us all sit up on our hind legs and beg. Well, he's gotta make up his mind soon. Yeah. Well, he's gonna spring the big news tonight right after dinner. Oh! I'm sure it will be you, Jerry. I don't know. But I can promise you one thing. Yes? - I won't finish worse than third. - Jerry! Jerry, do you mind if I go down ahead of you? I need a cocktail? No, go ahead. That's the picture as I see it. As usual my dear, you see things very clearly. I must do something if I can. Come in. I can. I'm sorry. I was told you'd be alone, Mr. Gifford. He's going to be. Please come in. Shall I send in cocktails. Never mind Evelyn, we'll join you presently. I wanted to speak to you. - You're looking lovely, as usual. - Thank you. Jerry tells me you're announcing your choice tonight. Yes, that is my unpleasant duty. Unpleasant? I'll have to disappoint two excellent men. I came here to talk to you about Jerry. As you may have noticed, he's an extremely modest man. I don't consider that a weakness. But I do wish he'd tried to sell himself more. Sometimes I have to do it for him. He has so many fine qualities. Perhaps you've overlooked. I assure you I haven't overlook a thing. Then you like him? Very much. He's my favorite. - So you've already made your choice. - I have. Will you be perfectly honest with me? Have I influenced you in any way in your decision? Most definitely. May I kiss you for this? You certainly may. I'm very grateful to you, Mr. Gifford. And I'm sure there'll be many opportunities for me to prove that to you. But why should you be grateful to me? Because you told me you'd selected Jerry. I said no such thing. But you led me to believe... I'm sorry Mrs. Talbot, you led yourself to believe. - You said Jerry was your favorite! - He is. Then why aren't you giving him the job. Mrs. Talbot... I have studied your husband much more carefully than I have either of the others. In spite of his great talent, he has a certain handicap. And this handicap will not permit him to give his best to his work. What handicap? The fact that he won't try to sell himself and he isn't aggressive enough? I don't wish to be too specific. It's safe to say definitely that Jerry is out. I'm sorry. Thank you for telling me Mr. Gifford. - Hi, I was just fixing to come downstairs. - Don't hurry. What's the matter? You look like you just got hit by something. Something just hit you. - Me? - You're not gonna get the Brigg's job. - How do you know that? - Gifford just told me. Why did he tell you? Because I was trying to get the job for you. Carol, I told you before, that wasn't your business! I'd like to know why not. I'd helped you get everything else you've ever gotten! Now you've lost the biggest chance you ever had. I thought I'd been doing pretty well on my own. Well, it's about time you knew just how much I'd done for you. I've been behind every big deal you've ever made. Now, what's that suppose to mean? Do you suppose that Latham gave you the Dallas agency just because you sold a few second hand cars? And when Field Briggs came to Dallas to look you over... Well, he looked me over too. And before he left town he gave you the whole southwest district! My contract for the southwest district was signed two week before Briggs ever left New York. So your "hospitality" with Mr. Briggs is just a little wasted. I don't believe you. Briggs must have had quite a laugh at you... and at me. But thank God, Gifford is too big a man to make that kind of a deal. Oh look Jerry. We've both said too much already. This trip has been such a strain. Let's not argue about it. There's no argument. As far as I'm concerned, it's all settled. It's finished. I've been trying for a long time to save this marriage. Now I realize there's nothing worth saving. You can't mean it. You better start packing! I'll tell the others you're not coming down to dinner. I'll make arrangements for you to get back to New York. You're going to regret this, Jerry. I don't think so. I'll live and I'll do very well without you. And without your help. Now start packing. - Do you intend going back to Texas? - The devil with you and Texas! You leave Texas out of this. Would you like another cocktail, Mrs. Burns? Oh, thank you. No, I want to enjoy the wine. It isn't everyone who has appreciation of wine. What a creation you're wearing, Mrs. Baxter. Thank you very much. There you are Talbot. At last. Greetings. We're well into our drinks. Will Mrs. Talbot be down soon? No, I'm sorry to have to tell you, she's gone back to New York. She's... She's not feeling well. I do hope it isn't anything serious. No, it's nothing to worry about. She has a special medicine but... unfortunately she left it at the hotel. - Will she return? - No. - Tony... - Yes sir. Tony, remind me to send flowers to Mrs. Talbot in the morning. That won't be necessary, Mr. Gifford. No, I guess it won't. Thank you. To a long and happy life. Evelyn, I must compliment you. That was an excellent mousse. Isn't anyone else going to try the dessert? I couldn't eat another bite. I'm sure it's delicious, but... - I'm on a kind of diet. - I'm not too hungry. Except for my sadistic brother no one at this table has touched one bite of food since we sat down. Well, I have mother. And I can assure all of you, the dinner was delicious. Earnest, you've given us a very bad hour. Why not make the announcement and get it over with. Very well. I'd like if I may, to begin with a slight resume of the three gentlemen involved. Baxter. Burns. Talbot. Whether you have a choice or not... be assured that I have a high regard for all of you and I'd hate to face the task of finding men who could replace you. - Earnest, get on with it. - All right, Evelyn. Baxter... In our discussions, we've disagreed markedly at times, but that doesn't mean you've been wrong. Oh! I won't be too sure of that, Mr. Gifford. After all, you're much older and wiser. As I was about to say, Baxter, I like your spunk... and I think you have all the qualifications of a General Manager. Burns... You're the type of man a company can point to with pride. Up from the ranks and mastering every job we've given you. I'm sure you can do the same thing with the most important job in the company. Talbot... I think you have that "X plus" that makes a big man big. But there was something that made me doubt you could ever function successfully as a General Manager. A handicap... And frankly it made me decide against you... I was convinced that you were not aware of this handicap and I wanted to call it to your attention. An opportunity came my way that gave me a chance to do so. I can only guess at the results but this much I know... but suddenly you did become aware of it and have the courage to get rid of it. And just as suddenly I had found my new General Manager. Congratulations. Liz, I prayed I wouldn't get it. I honestly prayed. Oh, when he put his hand on you, my heart stopped beating. I told you he was a smart cookie. Isn't anyone going to congratulate the winner? I'm so happy for you. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Let me know when I can be of any help. - Thank you very much. It's fine with me. I'm not demanding a recount. I think Mr. Gifford's to be congratulated too. Thank you. Anderson, these people are starving. You may start serving dinner again. Ladies, gentlemen... Jerry, you sit here. Sid, remind me to tell you... One moment, please. May I propose an after-dinner toast before dinner. To our new General Manager and the two brightest stars in his team. May your success continue to keep me wealthy. And to these lovely ladies, already wealthy in charm and ways and happiness. You know it's... it's a wonderful world. A great big wonderful woman's world because men are in it. Thank you.
