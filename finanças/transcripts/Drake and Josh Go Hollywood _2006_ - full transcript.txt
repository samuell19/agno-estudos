That's your level of excitement for me? Sorry. Wow! Now can I get back to my smoothie? Come on. This writing class is a really big deal. They only accept five high school juniors every summer.

TV REPORTER: Here in Washington D.C., I'm standing in front of the United States Treasury building where a major theft took place earlier this week. According to D.C.

You put our 11-year-old little tween sister on a plane to the wrong city? All right, all right, this is no time to panic! This is the perfect time to panic! You've got to stop that plane. That's impossible. Why?! Just call the pilot man and tell him to turn the plane off and not to fly away. I'm sorry, but once the doors of the plane have been closed, the flight can't be stopped from taking off. Okay. We understand. We'll respect your rules. Let's go home, Josh. Certainly.
