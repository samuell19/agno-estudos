Catch the wind! And use your mask! "Terminate all traitors." That is my task. But the Organization ordered me to capture you alive. As such, I'll simply make sure you never escape again. Allow me to begin. Grasshopper-Aug. He completed you? SHIN MASKED RIDER I hear wind. Why do I hear wind blowing inside me? Did I kill them? No. My body moved by itself. I don't get it. I killed them. How could I do that? What is this? I came to free you. Follow me if you want to escape. What is this? What happened to my body? You broke me out. You must know something. Please tell me! Why? Why am I so strong? I'll answer your questions, young Hongo. Professor Midorikawa? The Organization has been developing synthetic insect-hybrid augmentation. You are the project's masterpiece. You can revert to human form at any time. Simply expel the excess prana from your Energy Converter. Professor, how do you know all this? Because I chose you to be our comrade. It was my scientific research group that upgraded your body into its new form. You did this? You're the only one I could trust with the future of prana. It had to be you. Prana is an omnipresent source of energy that sustains all life. Your body now uses condensed prana to wield super-human powers. Your body has been equipped with a Prana Absorption-Amplification System. Your protective gear has a Converter Lung. It's integrated with your Belt and Mask. You gave me such power... - Why? - Because you wanted it. Superior strength. I wanted it? I know what happened to you in college. I know your despair. You've pursued greater strength ever since that day. You wanted the power to protect. And now that power is yours. But Professor, I punched people to death. This power is monstrous. I can't... All of the Organization's Augs possess the same power. But they use it for their own gratification. Please use yours for the people. Use your power to protect the countless weak. We must destroy the Organization. Please help us with our mission. Forgive me for not introducing my daughter sooner. I'm Midorikawa Ruriko. Um, I'm... Hongo Takeshi. Straight-A student. All-round athlete. But you're a glum-chum. That's why you're unemployed. Motorcycles are your only hobby. I don't trust people. But I'll put some faith in your abilities. I'll let you tag along, but you'll have to dress better. This is an essential for motorcycle riders. And, heroes always wear red, right? Or something like that. This your motorcycle Cyclone. It's part of your Grasshopper-Aug System. We tailored it to you. All this to fight the Organization? Is that spider mask guy an "Aug" too? He is. Spider-Aug. One of the other groups made him. He's an Evil-Infused Augmentation. Damn! Flee! Hello. - Professor! - Don't worry about me! Spider-Aug, I've already done my part. Go ahead. Kill me. Rest assured. I shall fulfill your wish, as only I can. "Terminate all traitors." That is my task. I do like the way this feels. I take the life of my prey with my own hands. That's my idea of good manners. So now, Midorikawa Hiroshi, please die. Become a part of my happiness. Professor! Hongo... Look after Ruriko. Thank you for granting me happiness. I wish you eternal happiness too. You may have betrayed us, but you're also a dear fellow Aug. I'll leave you for now. This girl's a traitor too, but my orders are to bring her back alive. And it was foolish of you to return to human form. Now that you've expelled your energy, you cannot break my web. Farewell. You really are Midorikawa's masterpiece. You're less damaged than I expected, Grasshopper-Aug. That's not my name. It's... Rider. Call me Masked Rider. Spare me your rambling, traitor. It saddens me to kill a fellow Aug, but locusts have been a bad omen throughout history. You leave me no choice. I'll eradicate you now. "Terminate all nuisances." That is my task. I hate humans. On behalf of all Augs who shun humanity, I shall kill mankind myself. That's my idea of happiness. I like it. You have great close-range combat skills. But if you keep missing me, I have nothing to fear. The way you slaughtered my combatants was most impressive. Now that you've killed a human, you too know the happiness it brings. No! It doesn't make me happy at all! I like it. Such destructive power. You're no longer human, but we still can't see eye-to-eye. What a shame. Look at us. We are overwhelmingly lethal. Not being human is such bliss! We're both Augs. So why? Why don't you share my happiness? Now, please die. Become a part of my happiness. Oh darn. In the air, I'm at a great disadvantage! Put me down. I can walk. To prevent sensitive info from leaking, all agents melt when they die. That's how we'll end too. The leftover energy in my body is screaming. I can't control how violent I am when I wear this. The mask contains a system that boosts your survival instincts. It makes you more aggressive and erases your aversion to bloodshed. You enter a state where you can kill without mercy to stay alive. What I did... It pains me. "Pain" and "happy" are almost identical when you write them in kanji characters. "Happiness" is just one stroke away from "pain". At least when you endure the pain, you make somebody else happy. That's what it takes to protect others. He might be too kind. I'm sorry. Professor Midorikawa... I failed to save him. No apology needed. You saved me. That was enough. And it was Midorikawa who made you half-grasshopper without even asking. Forget about it. It doesn't bother me. He only made me to help him develop a practical use for prana. We had one thing in common. A bit of DNA. Just like you, I was merely one of his tools. You didn't hear Professor Midorikawa's last words. He said, "Look after Ruriko." I think he created this body of mine out of his love for you. That's a surprisingly positive take on his ego. You're so naive. No wonder he chose you. SHOCKER? That's the name of the Organization. As far as I know, they have four more Augs. It only gets tougher from here. I see Spider-Aug's prana has disappeared. Did Midorikawa's grasshopper defeat him? Yes. Is that flower a show of respect for Spider-Aug? Yes. I made an attempt to behave in the same manner as humans. Midorikawa Hiroshi is dead too. How is Ruriko doing? I believe she intends to utilize Grasshopper-Aug to remove your power of authority, Mr. Ichiro. I see. Even if she brings the grasshopper here, I have another apparatus for violence. You need not worry. Fight violence with violence. I appreciate the logic. Whomever may be deleted, it does not concern me. As long as the data is preserved. I like it when you get robotic, K. I saw the data from your mask. You waste way too much prana. You must fight more efficiently. Your entire biology now depends on prana. If you use it all, you'll lose your somatic code. - So watch it. - Got it. But why am I half-hopper? Insects and humans are the most evolved species on this planet. According to my father, combining them forms the ideal organism. Cautious hoppers and aggressive humans. Makes a nice balance. Or something like that. You have a spare safe house? I do. I'm always fully prepared. We can get ready here without anybody knowing. Who are you? You don't look like cops. So you're with Intelligence? Or is it Security? He's with Intelligence. I'm just a government official on janitor duty. I clean up SHOCKER's mess. And you want to clean us up too? The opposite. We want your help. We need help eliminating their agents. In return, we'll share our intel and guarantee your security. - If we decline? - Use your imagination. What is SHOCKER trying to do? Word has it, they're pursuing happiness for all mankind. Close enough. SHOCKER was founded by a Japanese billionaire. It's currently lead by the most advanced artificial intelligence in the world, I. Happy third birthday, I. And it's a pleasure to meet you, J. I created the autonomous AI system J to monitor the outside world. Are you the gentleman who created I? I drafted the plan and provided the funds. That's all. The creator of I is modern man's science. I has been in a closed network ever since J was activated. All of I's information comes through J. You can unify the world, I. Once that happens, you can lead mankind to the world beyond. Your role, J, is to observe humans in despair, and identify the type of happiness they seek. How do people who have no hope overcome despair and attain happiness? I want to know. Certainly. I shall report to I. One year later, J was updated to K. J's frame was switched off. The founder gave I and K a final mission: "Lead all of mankind to happiness." Then he killed himself. After running simulations, I concluded their goal shouldn't be "the greatest happiness for the greatest number." The plan was to create a method to save humans experiencing the deepest despair. This would provide mankind with the ideal model for happiness. Just as the founder wished. In order to develop and deploy the ideal model, and save the world's most hopeless people using mankind's most advanced technology, K established an underground organization. That's the secret society: "Sustainable Happiness Organization with Computational Knowledge Embedded Remodeling." A.K.A. "SHOCKER". Okay. Now we'll share our information. Considering it's mostly OSINT and SIGINT, this data's not bad. You're better than I thought. After you destroy them, what happens to us? Still pending. But I'll try to make sure you won't be killed. You're honest for an adult. Okay. I'll play along. How do we communicate? Texts and phone calls can be intercepted, by SHOCKER and other foreign parties in our trade. Contact nobody but me or him. - How? - Just raise your hand. You're already persons of highest interest. We're watching you 24-7. For our protection? If you sign the contract. Okay. But no paper trails. Consider it signed. Accepted. You are now members of the official Anti-SHOCKER Alliance. We're counting on you. We want to eradicate Bat-Aug first. We've already located his lair. I've arranged approval for you to intervene immediately. Know how to use it? One magazine isn't enough. I'll need a spare. Do you have a plan? Yes. I'm always fully prepared. I'll need another gun. You've pursued greater strength ever since that day. You wanted the power to protect. This is what it feels like to kill, Dad. Are you really going alone? At the moment, that's our safest bet. I should go too. I want to protect you. Not happening. Can you wear that mask again? Can you kill again? Can you overcome your despair? Yes. I promised I'd protect you. Promise? You just got chatty with my father on his deathbed. Not my problem. You don't know a thing about me. You are too kind. I can't rely on you in battle. Unlike you, I'm in all the way. Take me to the lair. Midorikawa's little girl? Foolish insects fly into the flame. Long time no see, K. That coat suits you well, Ms. Ruriko. You do social pleasantries now? You're learning well. Action is eloquence. But may I ask why you came? To recommend a surrender. How considerate of you. However, I doubt Mr. Bat-Aug will surrender. Looks like you're right. Later, K. She's a feisty one. Just as I expected. Nothing but automatons here. He still trusts nobody. Well, neither do I. It's been a while, you old bat. How impudent of you, traitor. You're still researching viruses, despite my father's warnings? Of course I am. My Bat Virus is a work of art, essential to the happiness of all mankind. Your virus is a "work of art"? Twisted old men never change. Surrender now. Or I'll put a dent in your precious virus. Be my guest. I've already perfected it. This is what you get for making fun of my research. Now the little lady's life is all mine. Should we intervene? Wait. This looks complicated. Leave it to Masked Rider. Let's see what Hongo Takeshi can do. Unlike you, I'm in all the way. No. I'm not like you, Dad. You finally made it. We've been waiting, Hopper-Boy. The name's Masked Rider. So you're Bat-Aug? Indeed. I am SHOCKER's greatest Chief of Biochemical Research, Bat-Aug. Who are they? They're samples for my experiment. They're nothing for you to worry about. What you should worry about is this little girl. Miss Ruriko! Hopper-Boy! Do you know what has eliminated the greatest number of humans in history? Epidemics? Correct. Not famine, nor war. Epidemics! Epidemics are wonderful. They expose society's decay, and highlight what is truly needed for the happiness of all humanity. You're wrong. Epidemics bring sadness to all people, without exception. Eradicating epidemics is one thing that makes all of humanity happy. I knew it. Simpletons can't appreciate my ideals, nor my art. This Bat Virus is my greatest masterpiece. Reducing the ever-increasing population by design, it enables the superior survivors to become even happier. That's art! And now, Midorikawa's daughter is one of them. She's been infected with my art. She is my servant. If I give the order, she will die instantly. - What did you do?! - A demonstration. I hope the simpleton now appreciates the level of perfection I have attained. So, Hopper-Boy. Will you oppose me, and let the girl die? Or will you serve me, and let her live? Those are your only options. What will you do, Hopper-Boy? Okay. - Have it your way. - Good choice. For starters, let's get you disarmed. Remove that disturbing piece of equipment from your head. Now you are infected with my Bat Virus too. You are my servant. And now, I want you to kill Midorikawa's daughter right here and now. Tear her to shreds. Send her to join Midorikawa with your own bare hands. I have been waiting for a moment like this for years. This is what I call bliss! What's this? Without the mask, you're exposed to the virus. Why isn't it working? That shouldn't be possible! But lo and behold! The girl too? Why are you able to move? Midorikawa told you. When it comes to living organisms, prana is almighty. From the moment the virus enters the host, it possesses prana. To render the virus harmless, I just had to rewrite its code. You brat! You got infected on purpose?! Exactly. I'm always fully prepared. Finding it hard to fly? Die! It appears the situation has taken a turn for the worse. I believe it's time for a strategic change of plans. Not so fast! What a shame, Hopper-Boy! You can only jump 66.30 meters high. I am beyond your reach. Midorikawa, why doesn't anybody understand me? You came. Yeah. I did. You okay? Not wearing yourself out? I'm fine. I'll be okay. I want to protect people. I'll trust my heart. So you made a choice. Madam Scorpion-Aug, they fell for the decoy, just as you planned. Golly good. Then it's time we got this tail to a mass-murdering party. We're gonna use my cute little toxins. I'm gonna fix the world! - Waah! - What's this? Yikes spikes! We have party poopers. It's a little early, but let's get this party rocking. So people, let's party! Slaughtering is such a ball! Ecstasy! Super ecstasy! Come on, pleasure me more! You boys can't get enough? As you wish. Very good. Let's go all the way. Yikes spikes! Flop. Scorpion-Aug has been neutralized. We've dealt with the Scorpion issue ourselves. Your assistance is not required. The prana system doesn't work against Scorpion-Aug's venomous chemical weapons. Thanks for stepping up. - As for our next target... - I know. Wasp-Aug, right? Do you know Wasp-Aug? I was born and raised in the Organization. I know most of the main agents. And I know her particularly well. She's the closest thing I have to a friend. Will you get her to surrender? No, her ambitions are too dangerous. It's better for all if she disappears. Are all the agents at SHOCKER such dangerous dudes? Those at the executive level are. But the lower-level agents and combatants are just conscripts. Prana is used to brainwash them. They have no free will. They're given enhanced bodies and forced into service. You'd still be one of them, if I didn't get you out. The suits might've already dealt with you, like they did with Scorpion-Aug. What's wrong? You don't like my way with words? Is this SHOCKER's doing? Yes. Wasp-Aug's colony must reach further than the agency's intel shows. Miss Midorikawa Ruriko? Her Highness Wasp-Aug has been waiting. If you'd be so kind, please follow me. Your ears are better than mine. Once we're inside, locate the server. Got it. There you are, Ruri-Ruri. Welcome to my hive. Your taste hasn't changed. Taste reflects one character. Isn't this place gorgeous? Shall we have champagne to celebrate our reunion? Unfortunately, we're out of Goût de Diamants. A Shipwreck will have to do. Good evening, K. You work so hard. You are too kind. I'm here to observe you because that is my task. I see the gentleman didn't come by motorcycle today. Won't you join us? No alcohol, thanks. You know why we're here, Hiromi. To eradicate us? Exterminate us? Either way, it sounds unpleasant. And "Hiromi" is my old code name. Now that I'm a high-ranking executive at SHOCKER, it's "Wasp-Aug." Do keep up. One word of advice. Leave SHOCKER, Hiromi. I have advice for you too. Come back to SHOCKER, Ruri-Ruri. You've enjoyed SHOCKER's splendor since the day you were born. I's secret society, forever realizing our happiness. Domination is the little thing in life that makes me happy. Submission is what makes my slaves happy. For us to be truly happy, we need an efficient system of slavery, that benefits both nature and society. We must reconstruct and implement a new, controlled global system. This town is the test model. So, now you understand what I aim to achieve, you should both come back to SHOCKER. Become cornerstones of a global system that's right. Those born to SHOCKER return to SHOCKER. That's what's right. Sorry, Hiromi. I can't do that. Neither can I. Oh dear. Negotiations have broken down already. I hate violence, but... I have no choice. Now she's Wasp-Aug? You stole their prana? I did. Now I'm complete. Ichiro asked me to bring you in, Ruriko. Don't fight it. These are the lucky locals chosen to participate in my social experiment. They're just innocent workers. You won't be violent with them, will you? I hate violence too. Oh dear. Did I screw things up? Go. He retreated without even putting up a fight. He's too soft. That's Hongo's strong point. His weak point too. Is it really our job to make up for his shortfalls? You seem at home. I always camp outdoors when I tour on my bike. It's less convenient, but more fun. I go whenever I can. Wherever I go, it's a battlefield. But I'm always fully prepared. I want to finish editing Butterfly-Aug's basic program before he hatches. Or it'll get hella crazy. Butterfly-Aug? I'll fill you in later. Don't mind me. I install programs to my brain through my eyes. I'm a computational organism, made by the Organization. Slow down. Try savoring your food. No time for that. I'm refueling. This is all about nutrition intake. I don't get hungry anymore. Having an efficient body is boring. That's my father's prana system. All living organisms emit prana into the air. Your device absorbs it, converting it into bioenergy. In other words, you breathe the life of others. But if all of humanity stopped eating and started wearing that device, we'd just end up with people stealing each other's prana. That road leads to nowhere but extinction. That's why my father quit developing insect hybrids. Your prana converter was his last. My father lived with hope, but he always found despair. It's pretty obvious when you think about it. Full of ideals, he was an idiot. And the idiot's conclusion was to pin all his hopes on you. This is Wasp-Aug's territory too? We control our prana, but they're just Hiromi's puppets. Unless we stop her, this'll happen globally. So we must destroy her brainwashing system, or her hive will always be full of innocent drones? The system's a beta version. It should be stored on an external device. Did you locate the server? I did. I just need to destroy it, right? It won't be that easy. I want you to go in alone this time. I have a plan. Don't trust me. Trust my plan. Okay. But I won't trust your plan. I'll try trusting you. Thanks, Miss Ruriko. Thank you, Ruri-Ruri. I do appreciate the invitation. Feel like returning to the Organization? No. I feel like a fight. Oh dear. That's a shame. Up here on the roof your bodyguard can't pop in on his bike to save you. Doesn't it scare you going solo? Of course I'm scared. But I'm always fully prepared. And you should know, I believe in the man called Masked Rider. We've already thwarted your plan. Surrender, for Miss Ruriko's sake too. That angle is going to backfire. I want to make Ruriko cry. So, I'm turning you down. Hongo Takeshi, the hornet is your natural predator. Think you can beat us? This katana is custom-made. It can slice right through your body armor. Oh dear. I won't lose, but I can't win. He leaves me no choice. I'm going to need your prana. My pleasure. Change. Now we have the same basic specifications. And now, we have the same weapons. Here I come. Ruriko, I'm going to break your little toy before your eyes. So cry. Break down and cry hard for me. Burst into tears, right here and now. I want to make sure you're sad. Hurt. Lost. Please, Ruriko! Oh dear. It stopped halfway? Wasp-Aug! Say your prayers. This is the end? Oh dear. You had me. Why? If I wear this any longer, I'll kill you. I don't want that. Neither does Miss Ruriko. Don't do it. Oh dear. You are so kind. I don't have any friends. But... I can't kill you. We respect your personal thoughts. We'll handle it from here. One little warning. Guns don't work on me. Oh dear. This is what gets me? Don't tell me... Scorpion-Aug's venom? Hiromi? What a shame. I wanted you to kill me, Ruri-Ruri. Is this why you attacked Scorpion-Aug? No comment. Are you okay? I'm going to borrow your shoulder. Humans really are interesting. You're old-fashioned, K. Yes. I'm trying to behave in the same manner as humans. Are they the two traitors? Yes. I'm hoping they return to us without further ado. You are? Then I'm sorry, K. They're not coming back. Oh. Why not? Because I'm going to give them an icy cold end. Vengeance for Brother Spider-Aug. That is now my greatest wish. The two traitors will die. That's a promise. You call this a good hideout? There's nothing here! I need a shower. At least a change of clothes! Is that costume the only thing you own? Try washing it! It stunk back there. Fresh clothes. A female officer chose the underwear. I haven't seen them. You eliminated Hiromi because that's your job. I get it. Don't worry about me. Being hated is part of the job. There's no need to contain your emotions. I'm not. My emotions will be fine, after I change. You're too far away. You're getting changed. You need your space. That's my decision. When you're protecting me, stay close. Except for the bathroom. Be there, when I change and when I sleep. But don't do anything weird. It's okay. You're safe and secure. Safe and secure? That's a first. Sorry for being so annoying today. I just wanted someone to pamper me, for the first time in my life. My father and brother were so strict. - Brother? - I can finally make your dream come true. Soon, Ruriko. - Brother! - Hm? My brother Ichiro hatched. Your brother? Butterfly-Aug. We must stop him, or all hell will break loose. Not all of our departments work closely together. An overzealous special ops unit tried to take out Butterfly-Aug's lair. This was the result. The JSDF received an SOS and sent a rescue team. They found the unit like this. The weird thing is none of the bodies have any wounds. No traces of chemical or bio-weapons either. How were they killed? To be precise, they're both dead and alive. What do you mean? Butterfly-Aug has stolen their prana. Individual prana sequences are kept intact as they're removed, then they're sent elsewhere. It's like he's taken their souls to another dimension. We call it "The Habitat Realm." Either way, these people's prana will never return to their bodies. In that sense, they're already dead. You can cremate the bodies. The Habitat Realm... What's it like? It's pretty much hell. Hearts roam naked. It's a world where you can't lie. It's no place for a human. I intend to send every last human to The Habitat. Won't you stop me, K? If that's what makes you happy, do as you wish. I see. Then I shall. What will you do with Ms. Ruriko? There are no exceptions with The Habitat Project. Myself included. My brother's ultimate goal starts with seizing control of all mankind's prana. Once he has it, he'll send every last human to The Habitat. To do that, he must be the last human alive. Why would your brother plot something like that? Ichiro's mother was murdered when he was a child. It was a random killing. He hasn't trusted strangers, or humans at all since. I think my father probably joined SHOCKER for the same reason. Unlike Ichiro, my mother wasn't a human. SHOCKER's artificial womb is all I have for a mom. We created a system that uses prana to send each individual soul to The Habitat. My brother and I wrote the code. At the time, we all believed it would make us happier. We were wrong. It wasn't my idea of happiness. I have to stop my brother. That's why I fled, with the father I hate so much. I'll do this alone. Your help is not required. You don't want me tangled up in your family's problems? Don't worry. I'm already tangled. I'll help. Well, I'll need your mask. Installing a new program? Yep. Firstly, I'll prevent your mask from self-destructing. Then I'll slip in a program to secure your unique prana sequence to the mask. Or you might call it... Welcome home, Ruriko. I missed you. You can't complete The Habitat System without accessing my data. That's why you missed me. And without accessing my data, you can't complete your program to pariphalyze The Habitat System. That's why you came, right? This is a family meeting. Keep your nose out. Brother, Father died too. I know. He got what he deserved. But Mother didn't. She was killed for no reason. Stop trying to get revenge. It's not revenge. Leading all of humanity's prana to The Habitat is salvation. You've experienced its beauty. No death. No unfairness. A world for souls only. It's happiness. Utopia. No, it's unhappiness. Dystopia. The Habitat Project was all your idea, Ruriko. You wanted to help people understand each other. Why betray it? I knew nothing about the world back then. But I do now. Did our fool of a father fool you? All I knew was how to compute. But he showed me there are more worlds outside of ours. That's the only thing he ever did for me. You should look at the worlds beyond our own. Don't be afraid of hearts you can't read. There's no need. Trusting people is what kept mankind alive. Trusting people also got them betrayed. And to protect one's family from violence, one needs greater strength. I could have saved her, if I'd been stronger. She didn't have to die. Humans are the only living creatures that can solve conflict without violence. That's why I'm eradicating the perpetrator of violence: the human body itself. I don't think that's happiness. Ruriko, in kanji, removing just one line from "happy" makes "pain." It's so easy to destroy happiness in this world. Even if that's true, it's wrong to try to recreate the entire world. Brother... Trying to pariphalyze me already? A brave attempt, but you cannot pariphalyze me, Ruriko. My metamorphosis is complete. I've already become the synthetic-insect hybrid, Ultimate-Aug. Nobody can compare with my capacity for prana. It seems you're right. Hongo Takeshi, is it? Did you sleep with my sister? We don't share a romantic relationship. We share trust. Then I have no interest in you. I have things to do. You may flee. Leave my sister there. Wait. Please wait! My father chose you to protect her? I expected better. As Midorikawa Hiroshi's final masterpiece, you are most disappointing. I'll forget this happened. I don't care for a tit-for-tat. I'll leave you to him. You're the first-model Grasshopper-Aug "No. 1"? Oh, sorry. It's Masked Rider, right? You are? Ichimonji Hayato. I was supposed to be a journalist, but that doesn't seem the case anymore. He's Grasshopper-Aug, No. 2. Like yourself, he's a synthetic insect-hybrid augmentation. But I tweaked him, so he's an enhanced model. That's the story, apparently. So, let me show you. Transform. You don't need wind? Something doesn't feel quite right, but my orders are to defeat you. So, shall we duel? Sorry to say, but you cannot beat me. Probably not. Ichimonji Hayato, we'll do this another time. Let's retreat. You turn your back on my asylum? You will regret this, Ruriko. Still going? Yeah, I think he's ready. Did you condense enough prana? Great. Defeating you when you're weak wouldn't feel quite right. I'm okay. Let's settle this. What's wrong, Hongo? You're in the mood. Bring it on. Oh, I see. You show self-control, even with the mask. I'm impressed. Or was it just your kindness showing? I guess I like kind people. But there's a fine line between "kind" and "weak." If you hold back and I kill you, what happens to the girl? Get the picture? Give me all you have, Hongo. Ouch! So, that's you at full power? I like it. The second man, Ichimonji Hayato. He's been brainwashed, but he maintains his own will. This one's mentally tough too. I see. This makes it easier to see who's stronger. If we go at it mid-air, we won't disturb anybody. And it's easier for you to collect prana too. I like it. If I can analyze the data from Ichiro, I should be able to pariphalyze the brainwashing. Don't hold back, Hongo! You're trying to fight SHOCKER's brainwashing. I don't want to fight you. Don't be so naive. The only thing on my mind right now is fighting you. How lame! You disappoint me. Should we finish this here? That leg would take a while to heal anyway. Sorry. You're in the way. Move it, missy. I'm pariphalyzing SHOCKER's mind control. Your prana belongs to you. Take control of your soul again. "Isolate sad memories, then overwrite them with euphoria." That's SHOCKER's preferred method of mind control. But when it's undone, all the memories come flooding back. Stay strong amidst the waves of sadness, Ichimonji Hayato. Please. Become a Rider. Help him. Who are you? SHOCKER's new star. Part mantis, part chameleon. I'm Kamakiri Kameleon, or "K K-Aug" for short. I've never heard of you. You're not in my memory. Well, now we're acquainted. I'm the fruit of the labors of SHOCKER's finest scientific group. I'm the first tri-species synthetic hybrid augmentation. Created by the Angels of Death, I'm their latest and greatest work of art. Well done, if I do say so myself. Hey. Does it hurt? Betrayal is more evil than murder. Revenge is more noble than saving a life. This is for Spider-Aug. Die! Who the hell are you?! Me? I just became SHOCKER's enemy. Humanity's ally. I'm Ichimonji Hayato. And, I'm Masked Rider. Masked Rider? Huh? What's that? Thanks to the missy, my prana feels just right. From now on, I'll do as I please. For starters, I'll take you down. Start settling the score. I guess that means you're fresh out of the traitor oven? That seals the deal. I'm going to kill you. When it comes to traitors, I kill them all! Ouch! My super-duper mantis mask... You silly little grasshopper. I am salty now. I am mad salty. Die! Die! Brother Spider, forgive me. I'm sorry. So much for always being fully prepared. I made a blunder. Stop talking. I'm done for. I won't make it. While I still have my prana, one last thing. I sent the latest data to your mask. It contains my final will too. Your will? Like I said. I'm always fully prepared. And... Your scarf... I'm so glad it suits you. So, you left to join Midorikawa. Ruriko... First of all, when I first left SHOCKER, I thought I'd be dead before long. But thanks to you, I lived longer than I expected. Thanks. And that time with Hiromi too. Thanks. It was nice. Yeah, I'll thank the others while I'm at it. This is for the bearded guys. Tell them thanks. They treated me well. Please pass that on. Talking to a camera like this all by myself... It's kinda embarrassing. My body and energy converter won't be enough to pariphalyze my brother. Not now he's Butterfly-Aug. My volume of prana just isn't enough. But you can do it. I've installed the pariphalyze program on your mask. I will have transferred the latest data from my brother to it too. I'm giving everything to you because I believe in you. You have to stop him, Masked Rider, Hongo Takeshi. I'm so glad the scarf suits you. My father was into motorcycles before he joined SHOCKER. I saw him in a photo my brother has. It looks like this. I wanted to be in that photo. I envied him. I wanted to ride behind my father too. But not anymore. It felt really nice riding behind you. It felt like I was giving you my prana. I truly felt happy. I think I finally understood the meaning of happiness. Thanks, Takeshi. Goodbye. PS: I hope I can say the scarf bit face-to-face. I made a fatal mistake with the missy. I'm truly sorry. It's not your fault. I was too weak. I will carry on Miss Ruriko's torch. I'll keep fighting SHOCKER. What will you do, Ichimonji? My field of expertise used to be pens and cameras. I exposed evil. The truth was my weapon. When you fight evil, the whole world wins. I'll like having this power. I want to live free. From now on, I'll only do the things I like. It's not that I don't like you, but I wouldn't like being used by the guys behind you. I hate being part of the herd. Which means, I'd rather fight SHOCKER alone. You can enjoy solitude on a bike. That's why I like them. Bye, Hongo. Hongo Takeshi. We looked into your background. Your father was a policeman. Killed in the line of duty. My father was negotiating with a man who'd taken a hostage when he was killed. - I want to help you. - Liar! - I'm not lying. - Then ditch the gun! Throw it here! Hey! Stop it! Stop or I'll shoot! Stop! Stop! Only the strong can protect their loved ones. Dad... If I'd been stronger, I could've protected him. Dad! If he'd used the power he was given and fired his weapon, he would never have been killed. As he laid there dying, he kept asking if the hostage and killer were safe. He seemed more worried about them than the family he was leaving behind. He was kind to strangers, until the very end. I want to be as compassionate as my father, but unlike him, I want to use the power I have. You're not the only one. Many people have experienced despair, just like you. But everyone copes with it differently. You can get over this, in your own way. Thanks. You're right. Healed already? Yes. I think it'll be fine. It's time I saw Ichiro. Getting revenge for Ruriko? No. I just want to carry on her will, and make her wishes come true. I won't take revenge. And Ruriko isn't really gone. And... can I ask one favor? Going by yourself, Hongo? Is this my price to pay for the missy? They possess the same powers as you. They're Polymorphic Plague-Type Grasshopper-Augs. While you're a solitary creature, they're gregarious. In the locust phase, grasshoppers turn black and form swarms. They also become more savage. Now it's time to lose your prana and join Ruriko, Hongo Takeshi. No choice but to fight? There are so many. Can I defeat them? My mask won't last. Hop on! Hongo, I've made up my mind. I hate teamwork, but I'll try liking it. From now on, I'm Masked Rider No. 2! That makes us Double Riders. Yeah. This finally feels right. Uh-oh! That hurt! What showoffs. Without the body armor, we'd be in real trouble. You okay, Hongo? Sorry, Ichimonji-kun. Don't apologize. Just show your appreciation. Thanks, Ichimonji-kun. Cut the "kun." No need for formalities. Okay, Ichimonji. Whoa. We have more guests. Crank it up, Hongo. Let's do this, Ichimonji. - Hongo! - Ichimonji! So, shall we, Hongo? Yeah. Let's go, Ichimonji. You again? Yeah. I'll keep coming until I stop you. Your father entrusted me with this body. Your sister entrusted me with her wishes. I will stop you, no matter what. I'm in the middle of polishing up the perfect program, however... Okay. I'll play with you. For real?! Resistance is futile. My prana system is colossal. Midorikawa's Grasshopper-Aug cannot compare with my capacity for energy. Ichimonji! Sorry, Cyclone. I think that'll put your Habitat Project on hold for a while. Your prana fast-charger too. She put ideas in your head? I underestimated you boys. Consider this my apology. I'll take you seriously. Transform. Butterflies symbolize resurrection and immortality. And blue butterflies are messengers of the gods. Behold my complete form, Butterfly-Aug. So, now we have matching forms. I will save mankind in my own way. I am Masked Rider... Number Zero. Come. Wow! Even though we broke his throne, he's still pretty strong. Yeah. He is. He lives up to his reputation. By the way, Hongo, any idea how to defeat him? Yeah. Huh? You do? Next time you have an idea, please tell me first! It was in Miss Ruriko's will. We have to unmask him to do it. Whatever it takes. Okay. We'll get it done. Whatever it takes. Yeah. Whatever it takes. You're getting pesky. Whatever it takes! How impudent! If you want to destroy the Organization, leave it to me. I'll take SHOCKER, and all of humanity to The Habitat Realm! I'll do it for my sister too. And my parents. I'll avenge my whole family. You're wrong. Nobody in your family would want that. It's all in your head. You know nothing about me! I know a bit. My father was killed too. He fell victim to human absurdity! If that's true, why stop me?! I don't understand people. But I want to. That's why I'm trying change! I want to change myself, not the world! It's pointless. Everything is pointless, Hongo. No, it's not! Nothing in life is pointless! Ichimonji! I've got this! This is what Miss Ruriko wished for. She's in there. Brother. Ruriko. You were in here? You can stay with me. I've installed a program for it. Come with him. Before your body is totally lost. You thought I wouldn't notice? This place is too small for the three of us. I can't lose anyone else. I've had enough. I'm sorry, Ruriko. Wait, Brother. Wait, Brother! Brother... Wait. Did you speak with Miss Ruriko? Yeah. Thanks. However, you used too much prana on me. Unless you go, you'll disappear too. I'm prepared for that. You'd give your life for the soul of a stranger? Ruriko trusted you. I will too. Hongo. It's in your hands now, Ichimonji. Hongo! Really? I'm alone again? Oh, well. We come into this world alone, we die alone too. Hongo requested we recover and repair the mask. He said if he disappeared, he'd want you to continue calling yourself Masked Rider. We confirmed SHOCKER has a new agent, Cobra-Aug. Hongo Takeshi embedded his prana, his soul, in here. Will you carry on his will? Masked Rider? We found Midorikawa Ruriko's soul in the mask too. As Hongo wished, we've secured her prana in a safe location. For the missy and for Hongo, I'll try working with you guys. I feel a bit better now. Come to think of it, I never got your names. We're just nobodies. Huh? I don't trust people who won't share their names. I'm Tachibana. He's Taki. If you need something, raise your hand. I'd like a new Cyclone and suit. This mask feels nice. It doesn't have the cold, hungry feel of the last one. It feels kind. Yeah. Now I feel nice and fresh. So this is your soul? Hongo. Hongo, can you feel the wind? I can. My prana, my soul, may be inside the mask, but I feel the force of the wind, the sound of the exhaust, and the smells. I feel everything you feel. Go faster, Ichimonji. Let me savor the new Cyclone. Okay. Here we go, Hongo. We're not alone anymore. It's you and me. We'll fight SHOCKER together.
