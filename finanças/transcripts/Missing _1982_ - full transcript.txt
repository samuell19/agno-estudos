Captain Tower? Sorry. You may go. Vamos. Dejénlo pasar. ¡Dejénlo pasar! - Where do you live, Terry? - Why? So I can take you home. It's only 30 minutes until curfew. Just drop us at the Hotel Carrera. Thanks for the ride. - Um... - Listen, if you need anything, feel free to call me. Here's my business card. My home number's on the other side. Okay. - Thanks again. - Okay. I would take some photos. It's gonna be curfew. They shoot everyone on the street. The telephones don't work here either. Let's get a cab. Why didn't you let him drive us home? - I didn't want him to know where I lived. - What? Because I didn't want him to know where I lived! - We'll take a taxi. - No, ya no, es muy tarde. Vicuña Mackenna. ¡Sí, por favor! - Blew it. - You did not. Look, I have a credit card. We can stay here. It's curfew. Come on, we better go in. - ♪ ...your ding-a-ling ♪ - ♪ My ding-a-ling, my ding-a-ling ♪ I want you to play with my ding-a-ling ♪ Oh, your ding-a-ling, your ding-a-ling - ♪ We saw you playing with your... ♪ - CROWD: ♪ Ding-a-ling ♪ ♪ Oh, my ding-a-ling ♪ Everybody sing, I want to play with my di... ♪ Everybody, my, oh, my... ♪ ♪ All or nothing at all... ♪ You all right? Never better. Let's be positive, okay? I just keep thinking about what Patrick said, about bodies everywhere. Beth's all right. Nothing can happen to her. I hope so. She's probably hiding in the bathtub with the duck. Laugh. It's the best thing I've said all day. I just wish it was morning. Does the light bother you? No. No, not at all. Charlie, do you think it's smart to keep all those notes? Alto, es aquí. - Beth? - She's probably asleep, Charlie. Shh, shh, shh. Beth, it's me. Oh, shit. You're alive. Yep. - Where have you been? - In Viña. - You were supposed to be there one day. - Well, we couldn't get back. Why didn't you call me? I've been going nuts. - I know. There was nothing I could do. - I thought something terrible had happened. Well, we got trapped. You know, they cut the roads down and they shut off the telephone wires. - Come here. - I love you. Come here. I missed you. I didn't know if you were dead or alive. Everybody's safe. - Where's Terry? - Right there. - You shit! - Who? - You. I was worried about you. - You were worried? Hey! Hey, cut it out. Wait. Hold it. You creep! Living out at the beach, and I'm stuck here with the duck. This is from Charlie. Well, I heard it on the radio, but five minutes later, there were bombs going off right down the street. Really? Were you scared? Yeah, I hid under the bed. Want some help? Get-a your tootsie-fruitsie. Para ti, para mí. Why a duck? Why-a no goose? Why a duck? Why-a no goose? Hey, hope you guys aren't very hungry. - We're starved. - Huh! Seriously, Beth, is there anything to eat in this house besides a couple cockroaches? No. I'm sorry. I was scared to go out shopping. Hey, Beth, I got this off Charlie at Viña. Hey, Beth. How about a little Long Island ducky? Stuffed with a little Peruvian tuna fish, Spanish olives? Hmm? It's okay. I was just kidding. Hey, just kidding. Okay? - Old jokes. - I know. - I've listened to them for five days. - Try five years. - Señora Núñez... - Here. I know you can't get these here. You're looking for Beth? Beth Horman? She's in the bedroom. Go on. Pase, pase. "Si, gracias, señor." Oh, careful, señora. "Gracias, señor. Señora...?" Old jokes. I want to go home, Charlie. Now. - Come on, Beth. - We have to. I can't stand this place any more. - Okay, okay, we'll go. - I hate this house. Okay, we're going, we're going, we're going. Let's go with Terry, today. No, honey, we can't do that. We can't just leave without all my stuff. We gotta settle things up... - Just leave it. - We can't. We're going. I promise you. You don't know what it's like being here without you. Have you heard from anybody? From David or Frank? No. - I hope they're okay. - Me too. - I better go check on 'em. - Why don't you let me go? You take Terry to the airport. I gotta get outta here. - Okay. - You guys want me to take a walk? - Later. - Not too much later. See? Patrick said that they were running search-and-destroy missions. - Who's Patrick? - A colonel stationed in Viña. We saw some very upsetting things in Viña. - You gonna let me read it, or tell it to me? - Whichever you prefer. End of the line. - What time you coming home? - Four o'clock. I'll be waiting for you. You better watch out. - I won't be late. - You better not be. I'm warning you. - ¡Vía Magna, Plaza Italia! - That's me. - You sure you wanna go? - Yeah. - Love you. - Momentito, por favor. I'll see you in New York. Oh, don't forget to call our parents and tell them we'll be back in a couple of days. Two days, Charlie. Say goodbye to David and Frank for me. A partir de hoy, las mujeres en este país no usan más pantalones. What did he say? He said, "From now on, women in this country wear dresses." My God, look at this. A week ago, this was the quietest place on Earth. - Oh, come on. - It was a lot cooler than that. I think Braniff's over there. Here, wait a sec. - No quedan más, se acabó. - Shit. Al primero que se mueva, métele un balazo. Se queda en el suelo hasta que yo diga. I'm with her. Vengo con la señorita. ¿Adónde vas con eso? He wants to know where you're going. I... I'm an American. I was going to New York. I was going to Braniff to get my ticket. Es norteamericana y va a New York. The airport is closed, and there is no more planes. You may go. Don't look. Don't look. Excuse me. Could we speak to Mrs Tyler, please? There's nobody here by that name. Well, could we speak to whoever's in charge of helping American citizens leave the country? That's not our job. You'll have to talk to somebody at the consulate. We were told that the consulate was closed because of gunfire and that the consul was working here. Yeah? Well, that's news to me. Could you call for us and maybe find out? Look, lady, if you wanna see if the consulate is open, you're gonna have to go there. It's lunch time. Everybody's gone, and the phones are dead. Well, thank you very much. Excuse me. I'm Kate Newman, a freelance reporter out of New York. No comment. Just a friendly misunderstanding. Well, if you don't mind, if I were you, I'd come right back after lunch. Demand to see the ambassador. Don't try to get to the consulate, it's over a mile away and the streets are just murder. - Thanks. Wait. Miss Newman? - Yes? - Would you do me a big favour? - Sure. - Can I borrow your paper? - Certainly. I don't understand. There's nothing here. They told us in Viña that the military were executing thousands of people here. - There's nothing. - When were you in Viña? We just got back yesterday. Wanna hear something strange? Our hotel was full of American military officers. I'd forget about that. ¡Suélteme, estúpido! - ¡Déjenme ir con él! - Hey! Hey, wait a minute! - Do not meddle! - Jesus! Déjalos, son americanos. - Are you okay? - I'm all right. - For God's sake, why did you do that? - I don't know. I just... - I don't know. - Listen, both of you. Forget this and forget Viña. Find yourselves a safe place. A hotel with lots of people around. Just hole up there until you can get out of here. Hey. Hey! All right? You'll stay here? Gracias. You'll get a room for Beth and me too? I'll go get her. We'll be back as soon as we can. - All right? - Yeah. Got enough money? - Yeah, I think so. How about you? - I got my credit card. Here. Take it. You never know. Thanks, pal. Charlie... - Be careful. - Don't worry. They can't hurt us. We're Americans. I think I felt him kick. Come on, Maria. You gotta have faith. Carlos will be okay. Tienes que ser fuerte. Piensa en el niño. - She's right. - Sé que lo van a matar. No, Maria! He's probably up in the mountains hiding. I know they are going to kill him. They're killing everybody. - You should go now. - I got a few more minutes. No, you must go. I will take care of her. You'll be okay? Let me know if you get any news. Take care. - Okay, Frank? - Yeah. - How's she doing? - She's okay. Pia's with her. Frank, what did happen to Carlos? What's happening to everybody? I don't know. Look, maybe he's at an embassy as a refugee or something. - Or somebody accidentally blew his brains out. - David. - What about Silvio? - He's okay. He's in hiding but, er... - But Cleo really disappeared. - Oh, shit. All of a sudden, this place is like a free-fire zone. They shoot you just for being left-handed. Well, I hope you guys aren't planning to stay around too long. - Party's over. - It wasn't a party. They were trying to do something new here. Hey, I'm sorry, y'all, but I've gotta go. Charlie's gonna kill me. Promise to call us first thing when you get to New York? Use the phone booth at the corner of West Broadway and Prince, huh? Frank, I'm sorry things worked out for you the way they did. Listen, in a week we're all gonna be playing chess in Washington Square. - Checkers. - Checkers. I hope so. - Where you gonna be in New York? - His folks' house, Upper East Side. - Oh, chic! - That's us. Take care. It's my... oh, my bus! Taxi! - ¿Adónde va? - Vicuña Mackenna por favor. Oye, ven con nosotros. Atención, atención. Es la hora del toque de queda. Atención. Atención. Atención, es la hora del toque de queda. Despejad la calle enseguida. Vuelvan todos a sus casas. Despejad la calle. Atención, el toque de... ¡Vete a tu casa! ¿Qué quieres? Soy americana. El toque de queda, por favor, necesito ayuda. Get out. No foreigners here. - Help me. - Get out. Get out! ¡Alto, alto! ¡Escóndase, escóndase! Yoo-hoo, Charlie! Char... Charlie? Charlie? Charlie... Excuse me, señora. My husband? ¿Mi esposo? Did you see my husband? Gracias. You've been in touch with our embassy down there? Several times, sir. I spoke to a Mr Shipler. And? Senator, all they seem to know is that my son is missing. Hmm. Have you been to the State Department? I have tried, sir, many different people. You are the first person that would see me. Well, I urge you to get to them, Mr Horman. I'm trying, sir. How does your son make a living? Well, frankly, I... I guess he's a writer. Well, he says that he wants to... Well, the important thing right now is to help him, huh? Yes, sir. Here in the State Department, sir, we've investigated and have been unable to find any trace of your son. Neither our embassy down there nor the military government knows where he is. Yet the New York Times says he's been arrested. That's what your daughter-in-law told the press. She... She's been pestering those embassy people, so they told me. Terry Simon is a friend. She was there on vacation, caught in the coup. She confirmed everything that Beth told me. The arrested Americans have all been released thanks to our embassy's efforts. The last two, Teruggi and Holloway... They're friends of your son's. ...were released, and Teruggi left without even thanking the embassy. Mr Horman, this is gonna take a little time. I suggest you go back up to New York and relax and let us handle it. I met him in New York once, at the Third Church of Christ Scientist. - Doubt he'd remember that. - You're a Christian Scientist too? - Yes. - And your son? - You know how young people are. - Of course. Mr Horman, would you mind waiting here a moment? No, not at all. - Mr Horman? - Yes. - I think we've met before. - Yes, Congressman. New York? This is my assistant, Ann. - How do you do? - You know Bob. Do you mind if we talk while walking? No. Not at all, sir. - What did they say? - They think he's in hiding. - Why? - Political reasons. They think he'll surface as soon as things calm down. - What are his politics? - Liberal, I suppose. Liberal, or radical? Congressman, my son is much too wishy-washy to be a radical. - Are you sure? - What difference does it make? Well, it doesn't, of course, but you said that Percy and Abzug are sending cables? Well, they promised to, but so did Kemp and Koch and Magnuson and Javits and you. Well, I'm certainly gonna consider it. Good luck. God bless. Nice meeting you, Mr Horman. Mr Horman. What's that? That. This? Those are my books. One of those is a Bible. I'm a Christian Scientist. Pasaporte. Mr Horman? I'm Phil Putnam. I'm the US Consul down here. - Oh, thank heaven. - Sorry about the confusion. That's all right. Thank you. Is there any more news? Nothing so far, but I think we're on top of the situation. Muchas gracias. They cabled that you were coming down from Washington. ¡Déjenme, yo tengo mi salvoconducto, déjenme! We're over here in the Ford. - You'd think there was a war going on here. - Well, there is one, sort of. - Well, I thought the coup was over. - It is, but there are still problems. The ambassador can see you this afternoon at 3:30, if that's okay. - Oh, yes, yeah. The sooner the better. - Good. Cheerful little country you picked to live in. Yeah, well... How long have you been here? Three years, four months and 19 days. Counting the days. It's not a bad country, really. I'm just ready for a change. Where will you go next? My dream is to be posted to Brazil. But I'll go wherever they send me. Al hotel Cabrera. Ed. Ed. I'm sorry I didn't meet you at the airport. I've been trying to meet this Major Pieto... Mrs Horman? Hi. How are ya? You all right? All right. Good, good. Listen, we'll be back to pick you folks up at 2:30. Yes, 2:30. That's fine. I've been trying to meet this man, Major Pieto. This morning was the only time that I had that I could meet him. And the bathroom, sir. Thank you very much. - How was your trip? - A total delight. How's Elizabeth? How do you suppose? You blame me? Did you find out anything in Washington? No, but, erm... Putnam there thinks that things down here are in pretty good hands. You don't agree? Well, I don't expect a whole hell of a lot any more. No? Why? He's been gone two weeks. And I don't know. They give me the same song and dance over and over again. He could be hurt or... tortured. They don't give a goddamn about him. Oh look, really, I don't want to hear any of your anti-Establishment paranoia! I certainly get enough of that from my son. If he had settled down where he belongs, this never would have happened in the first place. Please don't cry. Beth, I'll find him. Charles wrote that these toilet articles were hard to get. Not any more. His mother sent him fudge. Why don't you go freshen up, huh? We only have one hour. Oh, by the way, where's Terry? She's at Braniff, picking up her ticket. - When does she go? - Tomorrow. Is she all right? Yeah, Ed. So am I. Come in. Ta-daa. Beth, before we get started, I have to ask you a question. I want you to answer me absolutely honestly. - Okay. - What did he do? - What? - What stupid thing did Charles do to cause his arrest, or make him go into hiding? - Ed, Charlie is not a stupid man. - He wasn't too smart! I can tell you, getting in such a mess that I have to fly 16 hours in order to... Sometimes I honestly think that that boy is incapable of doing anything, except, of course, give idealistic speeches and write novels that'll never be published. Unless the entire disappearing act is a stunt - to publicise his forthcoming autobiography. - Why don't you just go home? I'll find my husband by myself. - Beth, I'll be ready in a few minutes. - Take your time. I still want an answer to that question. - Mr Ambassador, Mr Horman. - Come right in, sir. - My pleasure, sir. - Mine too, sir. Captain Tower, United States Navy, our senior military group officer. Colonel Clay, our defence attaché. - Mr Horman. - Thank you. Mrs Horman, how are you today? Fine. - Shall I review? - Yes. But first... I want to express our deep concern over your son's disappearance. - Thank you. - I assure you every element at our disposal has been and will continue to be utilised to facilitate his safe return. That's exactly what I'd hoped to hear, Mr Ambassador. Go ahead, Consul Putnam. Sir, we've conducted an extensive investigation. Captain Tower and his staff have interviewed several residents in the area where Charles was last seen. Colonel Clay has maintained his contacts with military and police authorities. But after analysing all the data, we still come to the conclusion - that he must be in hiding. - From what? That's a valid question, Mrs Horman, and one we'd also like the answer to. We've been through this a hundred times. You know damn well he's not in hiding. Our whole neighbourhood saw him picked up by a goon squad. The military swears they haven't got him. Mrs Horman, I've been to the carabinero stations, I've been to the department of investigations, I even managed to get into the national stadium, and he's just plain not in their custody. So the hiding theory seems to be the most viable, at least for the present. That's dumb. If he were in hiding, he'd call me and let me know he was all right. Maybe he can't. There have been a lot of civilian accidents and injuries. No shit, Sherlock. Were you going to say something, Mr Horman? Er, yes. Erm... As the colonel suggested, if Charles was possibly injured, he could be in a coma, or suffering from amnesia... Have you checked the hospitals? - I have checked some of them, yes. - Why not all? It's pretty difficult to get into some of those hospitals right now, and... Translated, he means you can break a leg tripping over all the bodies. Well, the only thing that we know for sure right now is where he isn't. I may have some further news for you after tonight. I'm having dinner with the junta's chief of staff, Admiral Huidobro. God. That one again? Haven't you seen him yet? These people are very busy right now. I bet they are. By the way, Beth, do you have that list I asked you for? What list? I asked her for a list of Charles' friends so I could extend this investigation. I'll see that you get it. Beth, didn't you say that several of Charles' friends were contacted by the military - after he was supposedly arrested? - Yes, and they all called the consulate. - What telephone calls? - I wasn't aware of any. You certainly were. I saw all the notes on the calls the day Shipler showed me your file cards. I forgot that, sir. You're right. Yes, I think I do remember. Why don't you check that out sometime in the next couple of days? We'll meet again to take stock of the situation. If you need anything... Dave? Driver, please. If you need anything else, just let me or Captain Tower know, and we'll arrange it. - Very well, I'll see that he gets that list. - Not from me, he won't. And I'll start checking the phone logs and start working on the hospitals. - Thank you, Consul. - Call me Phil. - Mrs Horman. - Thank you again. What is the matter with you? Why were you so rude in there? - Jesus Christ! - And do you swear all the time? I'm sorry. I don't mean to offend you. Why aren't you cooperating with them? - I am cooperating with them. - Oh... I've been cooperating for two weeks, Ed! I'm sick and tired of getting fucked around by these people, that's why! - To the hotel, sir? - Yes. - Want some? - Uh-uh. Back. Back. One more step. It's an old joke. - Listen, we better go. Last bus is at six. - Right. ¡Vámonos! - Catch! - Right. I'll race ya. - Oh, no. No, you won't! - I'll beat ya! Hay huelga de camioneros y están bloqueados todos los caminos. - Sí, gracias. Fucking great. - What is it? The truckers are on strike, roads are all blocked. - How do we get back? - We don't. Beth is gonna go nuts. Isn't there another way? Are there any trains? Mañana, a las 9. - What'd he say? - He said, with any luck, there might be a train tomorrow at nine. So what do we do till then? - What is it? - I don't know. - That's the morning the coup started? - You got it. The 24-hour curfew had shut everything down. The phones were out. Charlie freaked because he couldn't reach Beth. Did you pick that up from Charlie? Charles picked it up from me. What happened next? Well, we stayed at the hotel. We didn't have much choice. And that's when you met all the Americans, right? - That's right. - And they were caught up by the coup also? - The others. - Then you met Babcock? No, no. Him we met the next morning. Wednesday, September 12. - Here? - Yeah, sure. Me permite su periódico, señor. You would do much better to ask in English, monsieur. - Tu es français? Pardon. - English. I come from Paris, Texas, boy. - You're American. - Yeah, red, white and blue. - Well, you fooled me. - Good, good. I was just pulling your leg there for you a little bit, er... - Charlie Horman. - Charlie! Nice to meet you. This is my friend, Terry Simon. - Terry, how are you? - All right. Yes, you are. Er... that's my friend. - Hello. - Hello. - Do you mind? - No, help yourself. - Thanks. What'd you say your name was? - Well, I didn't say it, Charles, - but my name's Andrew Babcock. - Andrew, nice to meet you. - Thanks a lot. Are you a tourist? - No, not exactly. What are you doing down here? Well, the navy sent me down here to do a job and, er... she's done. Where are you stationed? Panama's my home base, if that's what you mean. You said you're with the navy. Yeah, well, I'm really retired. I'm just on a special assignment. Really? What's it like in Panama? - Panama's nice. - Is it? And it's a good place to keep an eye on everything. There's my man from Milgroup. - Milgroup? What's Milgroup? - Milgroup's just a US military group. I'm afraid there isn't much news in there for someone with such big ears and such a long nose. - But enjoy it. - I will. - Enjoy. - Thanks. Sure enough. I remember Charlie said, "That's incredible." - I can't believe he just told us all that. - "I can't believe he said all that to us." That's when he decided we should both take notes. - Notes on what? - Didn't you hear what she just said? Ed, all those American officials in Viña were probably involved in the coup. - Do you believe that, Terry? - Wait a minute! Why don't you believe me? You were married to Charles. It colours your perceptions. You're his damn father. What does that do to your perceptions? Hey, come on. God! Whose side are you on? How did you finally... How did you finally get home? Ray Tower drove us back. Um... That's all right. Listen... if you need anything, feel free to call me. Here's my business card. Home number's on the back. Okay. Oh, Terry, guess who's having dinner together again tonight? - Admiral Huidobro? - Uh-huh. You gotta be kidding me. Again? - Again. Can you believe that guy? - Did he ask you for the list? Of course. Wait a minute. Is this Tower? How did you get to know him so well? We don't know him so well. Ed, when Charlie first disappeared, that's who we contacted. He invited us for dinner at his house. He said Admiral... - Huidobro. - Huidobro would be there too, and that it might be good for us to come so we could talk. But this admiral never showed up. Ed, it happened just like this! You were saying you went to Tower's house to see that admiral, and... Well, of course this admiral never showed up. And by that time it was way past curfew. Tower insisted that we spend the night, and there wasn't anything else we could do. Terry? - What do you want? - Got everything you need? Yes. I appreciate everything you've done for us, but would you do me a favour and get out of here? Please? You know, if I were you... I'd quit living in the past. I think it's about time you started thinking about your future. You gotta learn to stay ahead of the power curve, kid. - You know what I mean? - Leave me alone! - Terry, it's me. - It's an old aircraft carrier term. Come on. Hurry up. If a pilot gets ahead of the power curve and something happens, - then he can pull up and away. - Hurry up! But if he falls behind the power curve and something happens, then it's adios. You gotta stay ahead of the power curve, kid. And when we woke up the next morning, Tower was gone. - What time does your plane leave? - Nine o'clock. - Would you take a letter for Elizabeth? - Sure. - Thank you. I'll see you both in the morning. - Good night. - Night, Ed. - Want some fudge? Why did you take a bath in his house? Ed, I took a bath. We were stuck there. Ed? Ed. Wait a minute. Where are you going? Can't you lower your voice? For a walk. You can't go out for a walk. It's curfew. You'll get shot. Did she have an affair with Charles? Why did you come here? Había 4 soldados con un oficial y dos más trayendo unas cajas. She says it was late afternoon when they brought him out. There were four soldiers and an officer with him, and two other soldiers carried boxes of things. ¿Había otros soldados? Sí, había muchos, esperando en un camión militar. There were many other soldiers waiting in an army truck. ¿Qué estás diciendo, mujer? No fue así, te equivocas. Yo no oí más que unos pocos milicos y era un auto particular. - What did he say? - He claims it was a civilian truck, and there weren't many soldiers. No, estoy segura, había muchos soldados en un camión del ejército, yo los vi. She says yes, there were many soldiers, and it was definitely an army truck. Is she sure it was Charles? ¿Seguro que el muchacho fue mi marido? - Estoy segura que sí. - Huh? - She's pretty sure. - She's pretty sure? With witnesses like this, no wonder nobody can find him. Buenos... Gracias. - Gracias. - Hasta luego. - Is this the way you found it? - No. It was a real shambles. - You were living here? - Yeah. Why? What do you mean? We lived like everybody else. Well, I guess it's easy to be poor when you have a round-trip ticket in your pocket. Let me explain something, Ed. We're here because we wanna be here. We like it. We have friends here. We're not playing poor. It may sound weird to you but this is one of the happiest homes I've ever had. And I know Charlie feels the same way. Doesn't look like it now but we really had it together here. Local artist. Gracias. Your son's a pretty popular guy around here. - The Little Prince? - That's a great book. When we first got married, Charlie read me a chapter every night. It's about this little prince and he meets a wild fox in the desert, and little by little, by being very gentle and kind and thoughtful, he tames the fox, so the fox tells him a secret. Let's see. "It's only with the heart that one can see rightly. "What is essential is invisible to the eye." What is essential? The stuff you can't see. This is Charles' handwriting, isn't it? "Once upon a time, there was a country so far north "it was further north than the North Pole." Is this part of the same book? No. Charles... wrote this. "It was further north than the Big Dipper. "It was even further north than the Milky Way, and that's pretty far north." "Nobody knew the name of the country except the folks who lived there, "because the ink in the explorers' pen froze before they could write it down." What does this mean, "The Sunshine Grabber"? That's the name of a poem. It's an animated film Charlie's working on. This is one of the characters. Recognise the eyes? But he seems so innocent, almost deliberately naïve. Is that so bad? Is that so good? You raised him. - Who is it? - Soy yo, Beth. Hello. Señora Duran. Ed Horman. This is the lady I was telling you about, whose mother lives across the street. - Hello. - Buenos dias. - El coche está esperando. - Taxi's waiting. Aquí, a la derecha. I was leaving my mother, who lives across the street. A taxi came for me just when the soldiers put your husband in the truck. Ahora a la izquierda, por favor. My taxi followed the same road the truck took. Then they drove right into that big door and went inside the stadium. - How come you followed them? - She didn't... Let her answer, please. Why did your taxi take the same route as the truck? Well, I just live beyond the stadium. I have to go past here when I come from the house of my mother. Okay. - I don't believe that! - Ed, don't. Don't. They could arrest her just for talking to us. Hello, Beth. Mr Horman, my name's Kate Newman. I'm a reporter. Is it true you are fed up with the way the embassy's been handling this and you're planning your own investigation? - There's Putnam. - Er... I'm just not interested in challenging what they've done, I'm concerned with getting back my son. - Excuse us, please. - Beth, get him to talk to me, will you? - Okay. - Okay. - What happened? - Shall we sit down? Well, is there any news? We backtracked over all our military leads so far. They still deny knowledge of his arrest. We also had a fingerprint check made at all the morgues. Came up negative. - Do you trust your sources? - Captain Tower checked them himself. - Then I'm sure they're impeccable. - What we need now is more background information, mostly from Beth. For example, why you were living here. We were tired of seeing the world through the New York Times, and we wanted to travel. - And why this country specifically? - We've been all over Latin America. - This seemed the best of it. - You mean politically? I mean every way, till your generals took over. They're not our generals, Beth. Gentlemen, why don't we shift our ground a little here? - Beth, what was Charles doing? - Was? I'm sorry. What kind of work is Charles doing? He's working on an animated children's film, he's researching a screenplay, and he writes articles. - Articles for FIN? - What is FIN? It's a left-wing newspaper. It is not left-wing. Besides, he doesn't write for it. He translates news and feature stories for such bastions of American communism as the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal. - Mr Horman, there's another theory kicking around. - What is that? That your son was picked up by leftists posing as soldiers. As a matter of fact, there are even people who think it may have been his idea. You've gotta be kidding me. I mean, he could've done it to embarrass the government, - to make it look like they're arresting Americans. - They are arresting Americans. Or don't David Holloway and Frank Teruggi count?! Mrs Horman, of course they count. I heard about them in Washington, Teruggi and... They're released, right? We should speak to them. - We're seeing David tomorrow. - We are? Is that my list? No. These are things I'd just like you to check on, please. Hm. Okay, I'll do my best. Well, if that's all, I guess we can get back to work. Just one moment, please. To be very frank, I know that in these countries, the American embassies have agents that are involved with the local police - and the military training programmes... - This case has nothing... I assume that this case has something to do with it, that those sort of operations exist here, and I don't care how it is run, or who runs it, I just want you to use it to help find my son. - I assure you, Mr Horman... - That's all I have to say about it right now. Mr Horman, I noticed you were talking with a reporter before. I think it might be better for the investigation if you hold off on that for a while. You know what I mean? - I'll hold off. - Good. Mrs Horman. Three, please. God, I can't believe what you said there about that police training programme. I find if you call a spade a spade, you'll generally get a favourable response. - You can also get dead. - That's your paranoia, isn't it? - And, of course, Charles'. - Ed... Why didn't you make the list of his friends? - Are you serious? - Well, do I look like I'm joking? Ed, five minutes after I give that list to Tower, those friends will probably be arrested by the military. I didn't know Charles associated with such dangerous people. We're not criminals, Ed! - Charlie's not a failure. - I didn't say that. Every time you open your mouth, you imply it. If you had stayed where you belonged, and paid a little attention to the basics, this never would have happened. And what are the basics? God, country and Wall Street? - You know what I mean. - I know, I know. "God bless our way of life." A very good way of life it is, young lady, no matter how much people like you and Charles try to tear it down with your sloppy idealism. I can no longer abide the young people of our country who live off their parents and the fat of the land, and then they find nothing better to do than whine and complain! - Is that your image of Charlie and me? - Yes. Ed. How can that be? We're not freaked out. We're just two normal, slightly confused people trying to be connected to the whole damn rotten enchilada. Screw you then, Mr Horman! Why don't you just go back to New York? You're just messing things up. Ed? I'm sorry, Ed. Are you all right? I said I'm sorry. Shit. Always me and my big mouth. Frank, you're not asleep yet? Stop fucking around. Shit! - Está bien, no disparen. - ¿Has visto a Holloway? - Holloway. - ¿Dónde está Frank Teruggi? Frank? Holy shit. What's going on? - Be cool. - What is this? - Get your hands off me, asshole. - Stop, they'll kill you. Bullshit. We have the right to call our embassy! - ¡Son americanos! - Tranquilo, son americanos. - Lugar donde trabaja. - El Senado. - ¿Qué hace ahí? - Soy senador. ¿Dónde lo aprendió? - 40 años. - Estado civil. Você tira a roupa dessa gente e leva eles para cá. They're not gonna hurt us, okay? We, um, never found out what happened. A lot of rumours going around about... torture and specialists. - Brazilians. - You were tortured? Oh, no. Somebody stepped on my hand. They're gonna shoot us, aren't they, Frank? No, I don't think so, David. They're just trying to scare us, that's all. Well, they sure as hell succeeded. Come on, David, I can't take you anywhere. Next time we get arrested, I'm going alone. You're really full of shit, Frank. Come on. David, come on. They can't kill us. Our embassy'll go bananas. I can't help it. They're gonna shoot that guy, aren't they? Listen, I'll bet you dinner at Arturo's we'll be out of here by morning. Come on, what do you say? Come on. Teruggi? Teruggi! Looks like you lose, turkey. Now be strong, all right? As soon as I get outta here, I'm going to the embassy. Remember, you owe me one. Arturo's. - Vamos. - Hold your water, scumbag. I'm coming. That's the last time I ever saw Frank. They released me the next day. The State Department told me that Frank left when he got out. I spoke to Frank's dad in Chicago. Frank never called him or anyone else. - Maybe he's in hiding too. - You think Charlie's in hiding? I don't. Why do you insist upon rejecting that hope?! Because it's just not true. This newspaper that you all have worked on. Could that be the reason why you were arrested? They never even interrogated me about it. Was Charles very active in it? Just like the rest of us. Sometimes put in 18 hours a day just to get it out. Charles worked 18 hours a day? Sometimes, sure. What did you get paid for those 18 hours? A little gratitude, some respect. You don't get very many hot dogs with a little gratitude, do you? Let's don't start. Have you looked for Frank here? I looked for him everywhere, even in the morgue. He's just gone. Vanished. Sometimes I, er... I get the feeling we're never gonna see him again. I'm ready, Ed. What? - What are you doing? - I fix the telephone. The telephone works perfectly. Now is working better. - They fixed mine yesterday. - How can he be that brazen about it? Hello, Ray Tower. How is everything over there in your electric game room? Hello? Yes? What about? Thank you. Fine. Who was it? The ambassador wants to see me in the morning. - Why? - I don't know. Yes, sir. - Mr Horman, you can go in now. - Oh, thank you. Good morning. Beth, I'm sorry. You can't, er... this appointment is only for Mr Horman. Look, anything I'm about to hear, Phil, is for her also. It's all right, send them both in. Come right in, please. - Mr Ambassador. - Good morning. Have a seat. - What happened? - Just have a seat, please. - What happened, sir? - Did you find him? What? Oh, no, not that at all. I'm sorry. What is it, then? I hear you'd like to discuss some political questions. - What? - You suggested that there might be some kind of American police assistance programme down here? I'd like you to know nothing of that sort exists in this country. Mr Ambassador, I'm not interested in the politics of it. I brought it up only because I want you to use every resource at your command. I repeat, Mr Horman, no such operation exists. I got the clearance for those hospitals you wanted to visit. What about the national stadium? - I'm trying, but it's kind of touchy. - Handle it! What do you mean, "it's touchy"? Look, gentlemen... I know these are bad times, it's not fun for you people. It's certainly not fun for Beth or me. Or Charles. I know you're doing your best, I have to believe that. That's our only hope. But you have all the machinery on your side. Don't you see? You have all the connections. I'm a middle-aged businessman from New York City. I don't speak one word of Spanish. Here I am. My son may have been shot. Maybe he was tortured. Maybe he was... oh, Lord... beaten so badly that they're keeping him until he's well enough to be released. I don't know. I don't care. Really, I don't care. Because what is done is done. I just want you to reach those people and tell them I will take Charles back in any condition. I'm not gonna make a stink. I'm not gonna go to the newspapers. You make out any kind of a release form, I will sign it. I will absolve anyone, everyone, of everything. I just want my boy back! He's the only child I have, sir. Did you hear what I said? Yes, I did, Mr Horman. Oh... Come on, Ed. The meeting's over. - I made a fool out of myself. - Ed, you were great. Mr Horman, don't feel bad, please. Just try to understand. There are so many cases, they're all so important, and this isn't the only one we're working on. This is the only one that I care about. You and a lot of other people. I've never seen so many cables from Washington. What kind of pull do you have up there anyway? I'm an American citizen. Mr Horman. Sorry. Dave McGeary from the consulate, sir. I've got Beth outside in the car. I'll be with you in a moment. - You all set? - No, but let's get it over with. - Gracias. - Gracias. Where would you like to start? I've listed the hospitals geographically, and the first stop is St Anne's. - Okay. That's on Avenue Ruiz. - Yes, I know. Listen, er, if you don't mind my asking, what's Christian Science about? Faith. It's about faith. Faith in what? In truth. So there's no one in the register under the name of Horman? - No, sir. - Have we seen all of the patients? Yes, except for los perdidos, the ones with no names. - Well, where are they? - Below, in the basement. I am sure we don't have him, but you can check by yourself. I'm very sorry. Gracias, señor. Gracias. - No está. - Gracias. Muchas personas viene aquí todos los días. Many people come here every day. Seguramente algunos de ellos están locos. Several of them are certainly insane. Para eso. ¡Para eso! Ahí solamente son los desahuciados. Mr Horman. Sir, these are the incurables here. - Where you going? - Go ahead. I wanna take a walk. Ed, it's dangerous. You don't know your way around. Please, I'll catch a cab. I'll be fine. I... I need the air. I'm going with ya. - We're gonna walk. - Beth, you can't do that. It's too dangerous. Beth, it's too dangerous! Charles always used to drive me crazy when he was little. Cape Cod, running up and down the beach, throwing everything into the ocean. He still likes to do that. I wonder what they're doing up on old Cape Cod. Now, it's out of season. The beach is empty, the houses are all boarded up. I remember that summer. Before we were married, we came to visit you and Elizabeth, and y'all made us sleep in separate bedrooms. Yes. One night we snuck outta the house, went down to the beach to make out. There was all this sparkly phosphorous in the water. There was a guy there on the beach, listening to the Red Sox game on the radio. What else does Charles like to do? Oh, I don't know. He likes to pretend he's a country-western singer in the shower. But he's got a terrible voice. And he likes to cook corned beef hash with an egg in it. - And of course he's a star freak. - A what? A star freak. He can point out every constellation up there. - I never knew that. - Yeah. And he loves to make love on Sunday mornings. In fact, he's a regular sex maniac. I really don't want to hear about your... bedroom antics. Come on. Las papas... oh. - ¿Y el queso? - Aquí. That's Frank Teruggi. - Oh, my God. - You're not bad. If you have two houses, the state takes one house, and gives it to the man who has no house. You get to keep one house. Sí, sí. If you have two cars, the state takes one car, gives it to the man who has no car, and you get to keep one car. If you have two chickens, the state takes one chicken, gives it to the man who has no chicken, you get to keep one chicken. What's the matter, compañero? I thought you understood our revolution. I have two chickens. - That's the whole story. - I have two cameras. Women and children first! - Diapers! We got diapers in here. - No! Give it back! What is this supposed to be about? Why did you make this? Oh, just for fun. It was a party for Terry. She was to leave the next Sunday. Ever been to Viña? That's where these come from. Hey, that's an idea. We should take her to the beach. - It's a great beach. - I'll be in New York. - We'll go tomorrow. - I gotta renew my visa. You all go. - Next day. - Really, you shouldn't miss it. - No, go. Go tomorrow. - Day trip? Bring your camera. Bring your cameras. - I'll stay home. - That's all. Believe us, sir, your son is not what they told you. - How do you know that, Silvio? - He's a nice guy, he's sincere. Hard worker, but he's a political neophyte. He's terrified of violence. - What's wrong with that? - I'm not knocking him, sir. I like Charlie and I've got my fingers crossed. Why did you go into hiding? - I knew they would pick me up. - Why? What had you done? You Americans, you always assume you must do something before you can be arrested. - Isn't that the way it usually works? - Not here, Mr Horman. It's crazy, Charlie being arrested by them, when some people even thought he was from the CIA. What? You know, Charlie was always asking questions, taking notes on everything. - I warned him. - And? He just laughed and took a note. He will come back, Beth, just as Carlos has. - This is all of them, Colonel? - Me temo que sí. One form for each prisoner who was held and then released. - But none for my son? - All that means, er... he was not here. Why don't you come and check for yourself? I thought Frank Teruggi was released. - Who? - Terruggi. The man who was arrested with David Holloway. There is no release form. Very sorry. I don't recall his name. Shall we? Atención, su atención... Go ahead, Mr Horman. I... I can't seem to. You go ahead. You... you start. Charlie, this is Beth. I'm here with your dad, Charlie, and the American consul. So, if you can hear me, please come out, so we can take you home. Charles Horman, this is your father, Edmund. I'm here in the hope that you can hear me. Charles. Charles. Do you remember when we... took that trip together across country from LA to New York? Just the two of us? That's him. Oh, my God, that's him! - No, it's not. It's not him, Ed. - Charles! Charles! It's not him. It's not him, Ed. My father cannot come here, but how about some ice cream with my dinner, Colonel Espinoza? But, Ambassador, my friends have talked to refugees in the Swedish, Mexican and French embassies. However, the man they must see is here in your embassy. All these people have come here looking for protection. - I am responsible for their lives. - Oh, come on, look at them. Do they look like assassins? Ve y dile que no son problema. - Beth. Mr Horman. - Okay, Kate. This way. You must remember, Mr Paris is a desperate man. - How many refugees have you got here? - About 800, 900. There were four of them in Lutz's office. The general, of course, the colonel, my friend, who told me of this, - and the American. - You mean the prisoner? The American officer. No, the prisoner was in the next room. - Was he alive? - More or less. What do you mean, "more or less"? - I'm only telling you what I heard. - What the hell does "more or less" mean? Well, apparently he had been roughed up during interrogation. - How badly? - I don't know. I wasn't there. - Your friend was? - My former friend, Mr Horman. Nobody in this regime is my friend any longer. Who was the American officer in the room? Who knows? The ministry is full of them. Their Milgroup office is down the hall from the general. This is a scoop for you. Oh, Paris, everyone knows that. Did they mention the prisoner? Did they call the prisoner by name? - Horseman? - Horman? Maybe. Horman, sure. Horman. If I had been there, I would know for sure. I am an honour graduate of your police academy in Washington. I like America. There it is more democratic and someday I hope to... Paris, please. Just tell them what the General... Lutz said about the prisoner. - Who is Lutz? - He's the... He's the head of the local version of the CIA. He said the man must disappear. - Oh, my God! Why? - He knew too much. - About what? - I don't know. But only a few very important people have been detained at the Ministry of Defence, and most of them were killed shortly after interrogation. - The others were sent to camps. - What happened to my son? They drove him back to the stadium. How can you order the disappearance of an American? - I didn't order his disappearance! - Ed, he didn't. Listen, I'm a police officer, but I'm not a murderer. - We know you're a good man... - I have worked now for many different governments. Some, their politics I agreed with. Others, not so much. I have worked now for the junta for two weeks, but these are Nazis. They are destroying in just a few weeks everything that was beautiful about this country. What we need to know is can they order an American to disappear without consulting the Americans first? No, they wouldn't dare. How can I verify that? You can't. What's gonna happen to all these people? Safe for the moment. Later, they'll be deported. - What about Paris? - He's not even close to getting out of here. - Why does he talk? - If he gets enough press, they won't knock him off. They won't dare to. It's like the old switch-hitting game. Only way to survive. Do you think that prisoner in the other room was Charles? What do you think? What could Charles know that's so important? - Probably what he discovered in Viña. - Do you still have his notes? Yeah, at the hotel. - Stop it! Stop it! - Ed, you'll get shot! - Mr Horman. - Stop! Stop it! Good God! Shut this. What the hell were you trying to do? - Get us all killed? - I'm sorry. I am just beginning to get awfully sick and tired of all of this... shit! I saw your son do almost the same damn dumb thing. He did that? "During the barbecue, Ray Tower arrived. "Later he drove us back to Santiago. "Trip uneventful, aside roadblock incident, detailed page 12." - Ray Tower drove 'em back? - "Later he drove us back to Santiago." Well, what? Does that mean something? Would you go back to where they first meet Babcock? "Charlie: 'May I borrow that paper if you're through?' "Babcock with a French accent: 'You'd do better to ask in English.'" You're French? Skip ahead to why he was there. - What are you doing down here? - Oh, the navy sent me down to do a job. She's done. Do you have any idea how long we'll be stuck here in Viña? About a week. Everything's all right. The coup went very smoothly. - You're completely safe. - Was it planned very far in advance? Terry, does a bear shit in the woods? - Will the US recognise the new government? - That's up to the politicians. "Red-haired woman appeared edgy. "Babcock stopped talking." Was it Babcock who introduced them to Patrick? No, Charlie introduced himself. "The next day in the lobby..." Excuse me, Colonel. Colonel: "Hello. What are you doing in this neck of the woods?" "My name's Charles Horman. This is my friend, Terry Simon." "I explained that we'd come for one day and got stuck by the coup." Oh. You'll be here a while. The roads are closed. Yeah. Er... what's happening in the capital? The military's doing search-and-destroy missions, just like in Vietnam. There are bodies everywhere. It's a royal mess. How long before you think the roads are open? I don't know, but give me your room number, I'll keep you posted. I'd appreciate it. "I'm terribly anxious about Beth." "Next morning, Babcock "was sitting in lobby with carton of Kents and without lady friend." - How's it going? - Can't complain. Yourself? I complain. Uh-oh. Where are you going when you leave? Probably Bolivia. - Bolivia is beautiful. You'll love it. - That's what I hear. So are you. Of course, they have their problems too, but... If they've got problems, you'll probably go there next. I know I'll go there next. Sherlock, tell me something. What would a naval engineer be doing in Bolivia, "one of two landlocked countries in Latin America?" Sir, any news? So far, nothing. If I were you, I wouldn't be so anxious to be there. - It is a real battlefield. - But sir... Look, I have to meet somebody upstairs, but I'll be back in a couple of minutes. Then why don't you two come with me? I know a place where you can radio your parents in the US and tell them you're safe. - Couple of minutes. - I know I'm safe. It's my wife I'm worried about. You mind if I ask you a question? Certainly. Go ahead. - How do you feel about the coup? - Very good. I've been in a lot of, erm... frustrating situations before this. I was in Key West waiting for the Bay of Pigs. I even took an advanced scuba course for that invasion. If Kennedy had provided decent air cover, proper military support there, we wouldn't be having these problems here. "We arrived at the home of Paul Baker, "where Naval Mission radio was installed." Yeah, we received a cable through Panama on September 14th. "After radioing Dad, Patrick offered to arrange a ride to Santiago "with Captain Ray Tower, USN, "who's returning there with Herbert Porterfield." And the next day they came back? Yeah. On September 15th. "Checked out of hotel, and Patrick drove us to his house "for 'going away' barbecue." You're welcome to stay with us. We have an extra room, if the hotel's too expensive. That's very nice of you, but thanks anyway. - We have a Ping-Pong table too. - Ping-Pong? - Yes. - No, no thanks. So are you guys friendly with the local military down here? Some. I took Admiral Huidobro to the United States to buy arms last July. Military's all right but the truck drivers are the real heroes of this thing. They wanna talk to Babcock again this afternoon. "Because we were Americans, they considered us automatic allies "in anything the US might do." He had to be a hamburger to miss with a rocket. - Charlie, you determined to go back? - Mm-hm. You know about the rebels? Ray Tower is number two on their hit list. I wouldn't ride with him. I wanna see my wife. Thanks, anyway. - Hello, Ray. - Hi, Pat. Well, here's your chauffeur. Ray Tower, Charlie Horman. - Pleased to meet you, Charlie. - Nice to meet you. So the boss of Milgroup and the senior political officer both happened to be in Viña when the coup started. "We came to do a job and it's done." What did Babcock mean by that? Most people think the coup was prepared in Viña. Now, if we weren't involved in the coup, whatever Charlie saw or heard down there is meaningless. But if we were, it still doesn't mean much, but it could be significant. At least enough for somebody to take a look at his jacket. - What? His what? - His record. They keep a file on every American national living down here. So if somebody decided to review that file and found that Charlie worked for FIN, they might conclude that he was a guy who was well worth watching. Do you think that's what happened? It seems possible. Doesn't look so good, does it? Okay, we're all set. This gentleman is gonna take us through. Por acá. - Hace mucho frío ahí abajo. - Sí. He says it's quite cold down here. You better put on your sweater. I think you should wait upstairs. Todos ellos han sido identificados. These have all been identified. Vengan por acá. Vengan, vengan. Esos también han sido identificados. These too have all been identified as well. Estos también han sido identificados. These too, all identified. Estos no han sido identificados. The identities of these have yet to be determined. Ed? Who is he? Frank Teruggi. Jesus Christ almighty! Come on. Let's get her outta here. Get your hands off me. I'm not leaving here until I've looked for my husband. - Ed, come on, give me a hand. - You heard what she said. Señores, por favor, quiero respuestas. ¿Por qué el cuerpo...? Why wasn't the body discovered until now? What took so long? ¿Por qué tardaron tanto en descubrir el cadáver? What kind of world is this? You sound just like Charlie. Okay. It appears that Mr Teruggi was picked up for a curfew violation and detained at the stadium and then released. Then the carabineros found him later that night, dead on the street. Why did the State Department tell me that he'd left the country? I... most likely some, er... screw-up at local immigration. Phil, I'm not gonna leave this country until I find my son, alive or dead. What? No, it's just that... every new turn seems to lead us right back to the beginning, you know? Like we're going in circles. We're going in circles! Elizabeth! Can you...? Oh, yeah. Okay. Yes, that's better, dear. What? No! I'm fine. I'm just pooped, that's all. Beth? Yeah, she's all right. What? Yes. Yes, dear, I will. And you too. God bless you, Liz. Earthquake. Ed, not the elevator! Don't stay in the windows. It's dangerous! Señores, no se queden en las ventanas, es peligroso. Don't stay in the window. It's dangerous. Be calm. The hotel is earthquake-proof. No need for alarm! You can't go outside. It's curfew! Hey, you! Don't go out! Curfew! Please, don't. Go back to your... Ladies and gentlemen, please, go back to your rooms. There is no more danger. Vuelvan a las habitaciones, no hay peligro ya. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. I don't mind. You wanna go up? I'm still trying to come down. Beth, how about a drink, hm? - Help you sleep better and all that. - But not in the bar. Thank you. - A la vida. - A la v... To life. Charlie and I always say that. Now, erm... - I owe you an apology. - No, you don't. For a long time now, I've sold you short, both of you. I don't really know why, unless it's because I'm getting old. And I'm very stubborn. Why don't you sit over here? This past week, I've felt like, erm... my heart has just been torn out of me. It's okay. I feel very guilty. Charlie always says guilt is like fear. It's given to us for survival, not destruction. Beth, for what it's worth, I think you're one of the most courageous people I have ever met. I mean it. Thank you. Do you think he's dead? I don't know. No. No, I don't... think he's dead. But that's not how you really feel, is it? - I spoke to Elizabeth tonight. - And? She was speaking again with some people from the Ford Foundation in New York. They think we should contact Peter Cooke. He runs their office here. Do you mind if I skip that one? No. You kids love each other very much, don't you? I'm very sorry, sir, but Mr Cooke is out of the country until Monday. - Oh... - Can I be of some help? Well, I was just paying a courtesy call on Mr Cooke. You're Mr Horman, aren't you? Erm, why don't you come inside and we can talk for a while? - Well, I, er... - Mr Horman, please come in. Hi, I'm Peter Chernin. I'm an economic advisor with the Foundation. Would you come with me for a moment? Please, take a seat. I have a friend I play golf with. I won't identify him, except to say that he works for an English-speaking embassy here, and he's close to someone who has good contacts with the military. He thinks your son was executed in the national stadium on September 19th. That was nearly a month ago. Yes, sir. Could I, er... speak to your friend, or his contact? No, I'm afraid not. These are very dangerous times. I'll go anywhere, in any way. You can tie my hands. You can blindfold me. You can... I'm sorry. I am sorry, but I can't do that. I probably shouldn't even have told you. This is a terrible, terrible tragedy. Just give me a name. Please. Just... That's all right. I understand. Thank you for telling me. Ed. Ed. The ambassador is waiting for you in the ballroom. We've been trying to reach you all morning. I think we may have some good news. What would that be? That my son was executed in the stadium three days after his arrest? Wait. Who told you that? Ed, wait. Ah, good, Consul, you found him. Mr Horman, this is Mr Samuel Cross. Gentlemen, perhaps we'd be more comfortable over here. Mr Cross is a journalist with good access to left-wing circles down here and he's dug up some interesting information about your son. I believe that your son's alive and well, Mr Horman. Captain Tower asked me to make enquiries about Charles' whereabouts. I spoke with a guy who's currently helping political refugees escape. His organisation has secured credentials for three Americans to leave Santiago. One of them was your son. - Where is he? - He's in the north. He should be out of the country sometime next week. Can I contact him? No, I'm afraid you can't. But I'll lay odds he's home in New York before... Will you please get him out of here? Now, I said "please". I wanna speak to the two of you alone. Mr Cross, thank you very much. Mr Horman has some new information and I'll check it out right away. Yes, you do that. You call General Lutz. I have reason to believe that my son was killed by the military. - Where'd you hear that? - I do not think they would dare do that unless an American official co-signed a kill order. Don't you think that's a hell of a statement? Especially considering we're here to protect American citizens? Mr Horman, this mission has done everything humanly possible to locate your son. I think you knew he was dead from the start. If we knew, why wouldn't we tell you? I don't know that, but I'm gonna find out. Why would we want him dead? Probably because he knew of our involvement in the coup. We're not involved, Mr Horman. Our position has been completely neutral. That is a bald-faced lie! How can you say a thing like that when you have army colonels, - naval engineers, all over Viña del Mar? - Please, sit down. It's very obvious that you're harbouring some misconception - regarding our role here. - What is your role here... besides endorsing a regime that murders thousands of human beings? Let's level with each other, sir. If you hadn't been personally involved in this unfortunate incident you'd be sitting at home complacent and more or less oblivious to all of this. This mission is pledged to protect American interests. - Our interests, Mr Horman. - Well, they're not mine. There are over 3,000 US firms doing business down here, and those are American interests. In other words, your interests. I'm concerned with the preservation of a way of life. And a damn good one. Maybe that's why there's nobody out there. You can't have it both ways. I don't know what happened to your kid, Ed, but I understand he was a bit of a snoop. He poked his nose in dangerous places where he really didn't belong. Now, suppose... I went up to your town, New York, and I started messing around with the Mafia. I wind up dead in the East River. And my wife, or my father, complains to the police because they didn't protect me. They really wouldn't have much of a case, would they? You play with fire, you get burned. Just a minute. What's going on here? They wanna ask more questions about Charlie. - Who are you? - I'm Inspector Rojas. I am taking Mrs Horman to headquarters. - For what? - Interrogation. She's not going anywhere. - Ed? - Wait a minute. Would you get me the American consulate, please. Is everything all right? - Ed, what's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing, dear. I'd like to speak to Consul Putnam. This is Ed Horman calling. What'd they say at the Ford Foundation? - Consul, there's a... what's your name? - Inspector Rojas. An Inspector Rojas here, and he... Oh, just a minute. He wants to speak to you. Yes, Consul Putnam? Oh, I understand. Certainly. I will do as you say. Fine, sir. Thank you. Yes? Why? Yes, all right. But if I have any trouble with... I said, "All right". I'm going with you. - Name of missing person? - Don't you have this written down somewhere? I've answered a thousand times. - Name of missing person, please. - Charles Horman. Date of disappearance? September 16th. - Time of disappearance? - I'm not sure. He was arrested sometime that afternoon. I don't know exactly when. - Time unknown. - Hay una llamada para el señor Horman. You have a call, sir. I'll be right back. - Place of birth? - New York. In this room. Hello? I looked into that, Ed, and it appears that you were right. Yes, we've been informed that the body has been identified through a recheck of morgue fingerprints. Positive identification? Yes, absolutely positive. They found him. He was... buried in a wall. In a wall? I don't understand. They do that. It's quite common down here. Where was he killed? In the stadium? - It looks that way. - I see. Goodbye. His political affiliation? Please, Mrs Horman. We're going home. I love you, Ed. I want you to contact the military. I want you to demand all the other personal effects of Charles that were stolen from this house. - Ed, that's not very realistic. - Every drawing, every notebook, every article my son wrote or had. - Ed, I can't go to the... - Do it! Goddamnit, I don't care whether it's a lead-pipe cinch or difficult as hell. - I want it done. - I'll try. Right here, please. - Good. That takes care of it. - That's it? - Yes. - Okay. When will he be sent home? Erm, I'd say a few days. We've got to get some other clearances. Nothing important. We should be able to ship him home by Friday. - You're sure? - You've got my word on it. Wait, there's just one more thing. Just one. Did you mention the shipping charges? No, I didn't. There's going to be some sort of a fee in addition to the air freight duty. How much? - Do you have the exact...? - It comes to $931.14. That includes the, er... the freight and the taxes as well, of course. You mean you want it now? No, I don't think that's necessary. - When the body arrives, when it's shipped home... - Don't worry about it. We'll take care of it. - Good. Let me get this. - No, I wanna get rid of the money. Okay. - Departure to New York... - Beth! Mr Horman! Ah, hello there. We called your room this morning. You'd already checked out. I tried to leave you a message. I'm on my way to La Paz. Oh, Bolivia. That's where Babcock said he was going next, isn't it? Now that you mention it, yes. Miss Newman, thank you for your help. I'm terribly sorry. Beth... - You have a good flight, you hear? - Take care, both of you. - Beth. - Beth, no more special privileges. Listen, Mr Horman, I wish there was something we could say or do here. Well, there's something I'm gonna do. I'm gonna sue you, Phil, and Tower and the ambassador, and everybody who let that boy die. We're gonna make it so hot for you, you'll wish you were stationed in the Antarctic. - I guess that's your privilege. - No, that's my right. I just thank God that we live in a country where we can still put people like you in jail. Ed Horman filed suit charging 11 government officials, including Henry A Kissinger, with complicity and negligence in the death of his son. The body was not returned home until seven months later, making an accurate autopsy impossible. After years of litigation, the information necessary to prove or disprove complicity remained classified as secrets of state. The suit was dismissed. SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
