I think the greatest thing is the newspaper business. I think you really feel that you can go out every day and ask proper questions to people in power. Real question here is, what is the role of the newspaper in this society and the role of the young reporter in this society? The press is the enemy. The press is the enemy. No reporter from "The Washington Post" is ever to be in the White House. Had it not been for two young reporters of "The Washington Post," Richard Nixon might still be president. A lot of young people write to me and say, "Gee, I want to be a reporter as well." You cannot have a healthy democracy unless you have freedom of the press. Press freedom should be the concern of every human being. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press: isn't that an ideal we can all agree on? Bolsonaro! No! No! Brazil is a young democracy. We don't have very strong and established checks and balances, so freedom of the press is fragile. Two years ago, I covered President Bolsonaro's illegal attempt to influence the election. But since he became president, he has started to attack specific journalists and specific media outlets. So for half the Brazilian population, I am a whore who trades sex for information. It's the president of a country saying that a journalist wanted to give her "hole" in exchange for information against him, and it's part of the strategy to discredit journalists and especially women. It's like everybody feels authorized to harass me. "Prostitute called Patr√≠cia Campos Mello works in the whorehouse Folha de Sao Paulo." "Sex in journalism." "Everything for a hole. Do you want my hole?" Random people sending me messages saying, "So how much do you charge to fuck me?" "You should be raped." "We Bolsonarians do not accept prostitution in our ranks." They're spreading stuff that is gonna be forever in the internet. Ah. How many jobs you got? You need seven jobs not to be lazy. - A thousand. - A thousand jobs? Give me one job that you do every day. - Cook. - You cook? And how many jobs do you think I have? Come on. Three? Really? You think I only have three jobs? You know who has a lot of jobs? Squirrels got a lot of jobs. You know why? They always look like they're busy. Hey, Orlando. Carl, question. Apparently, there's a protest at 3:30. Yeah? I think you'd better stay there... - Okay. - Depending on what happens. All right, let me go and check it. - Okay, thanks, Carl. - All right, no problem. - Thanks. Bye. - Mm-hmm. Bye-bye. Come on, Milesy. Papa gotta go to work. George Floyd! - Say his name! George Floyd! - Say his name! George Floyd! - Say his name! George Floyd! - Say his name! George Floyd! - Say his name! George Floyd! - What do we want? Justice! - When do we want it? Now! - If we can't get it... Shut it down! If we can't get it... Shut it down! If we can't get it... Shut it down! Whose streets? Our streets! - Whose streets? Our streets! - No justice! No peace! - No justice! No peace! No justice! No peace! - No justice! No peace! - If we don't get it... Shut it down! If we don't get it... Shut it down! Hey, I'm just keeping an eye on this. The police department dispatched a patrol unit, and they have a couple of officers in unmarked cars and ATVs. - Okay, thanks, Carl. - All right? No problem. - Arms up! Don't shoot! - Arms up! Don't shoot! - Arms up! Don't shoot! Oh, shit. You must leave the area, or you are subject to arrest. Failure to comply with this order will subject you to arrest. Do you have anything? If you can pick just, like, one, that's great. Okay, want me to do it right now? Okay. And then we can get it online. - No problem. I'll do it... - Yeah, get it right now. It's all right. Just bear with me, all right? What you doing, son? Just chillaxing. - Chillaxing? - Yeah. - All right, you cool? - Mm. All right. Yeah, go ahead, Orlando. Are you out on the street? No, and I'm doing something for Nick. They need a time stamp of one of the pictures I shot during Fort Lauderdale. Apparently, the police gave some false reports about this protest, and my picture might be able to contradict whatever they said. - No problem, thanks. - Okay, brother. It's this one here. The police said that there was a distress call around 6:50:34, and that is not the case because they're already out. They already was engaging with the crowd. By now, we have tear gas being sent out. People running. This journalist got caught up in it. As journalists, we can't let the truth down. We are moderators of fact. We're moderators of falsehoods. And this is why newspapers like the "Herald" are so darn important. Because, you know, you have to begin to believe in what you see and what you hear. And the last 15 years, 20 years, you're beginning to doubt the very thing that you're... That you're watching and hearing. No. Good morning, everybody. Let's get started. We have an update from Mexico? Yes, good morning. Ongoing protests against police violence in Mexico. The local police are using very, very severe terror on journalists in order to block any kind of information getting out there that might affect them. A photographer was murdered brutally here in Mexico. We still don't know why. The investigation was never done properly. And that would be the third incident in the past four weeks. Well, look, I think we're at a critical moment. Are we talking to the people on the ground there? Yes. It's a very scary situation. And as a result, you know, there are entire areas basically turning into silent zones where traditional newspapers are stopping their publications altogether. That is a very bad sign. But this is happening, you know, widespread also. Harassment, threats, everything. In India, the government has tried to blackmail news organizations, and they're trying to track down people based on their mobile signals. In Belarus, four journalists are in jail for covering rallies in support of an opposition candidate. We had two journalists killed yesterday. One in Kenya, another in Somalia. The journalist Sajid Hussain's body was found in a river in Sweden. It's not clear how he ended up there, and I've been in touch with the family to try to figure that out. Governments attacking journalists is not new, but it's getting worse. We're seeing record numbers of journalists in prisons around the world. We're seeing the full power of the states deployed, you know, against journalists like, you know, Jamal Khashoggi. But the problem is, this is just one aspect. If you're in the United States, what about the news deserts? What about the collapse of local media? What about, you know, the lack of public confidence and trust in journalism and in experts and in information? That profound crisis is not going away. This is where the press used to be. It used to be a three-story press. This was all owned by the paper? Yes, yes, oh, yeah. Can still smell the ink. When I joined the newspaper in '79, big staff, press runs, trucks. You know, it was like, this was no different from any other daily newspaper being published in any city. But this had a 150-year history. Every community needs a newspaper to tell you what's going on in your town, to tell you what's going on in government, to expose government corruption. And so the question that needs to be asked is, what happens to a country that does not have strong newspapers? So the paper in Youngstown, "The Vindicator," closed down recently, meaning that Youngstown is now the biggest city in America without a local newspaper. Are you upset by that? No, it's just a sign of the times. They're a dying industry because they are so left-wing progressives. We are not left-wing progressives, so we stopped buying the newspaper. We stopped them just having one point of view, the Democrats. Why am I gonna pay for a paper that calls me all kinds of names because I'm a conservative Republican? That's why they're a dying industry. Don't you think, though, that this community has a right to have accountability journalism in it, though? Because that's what the function of that paper was. It was to hold the powerful to account. No, I don't believe they did. I'm not gonna buy a newspaper that doesn't reflect my views. I moved to America in November 2014. As a journalist, I've always been fascinated by just how unique American democracy is. But I have witnessed a lot of change from even just four or five years ago. Good afternoon. We continue to move the needle for Youngstown. Ladies and gentlemen, help me introduce Congressman Bill Johnson. Well, thank you, Mayor Brown. What you see here today are the results of some of the investments that have been made at both the federal, state, and the local level to move Youngstown forward. We've got the promise of an ethane cracker plant that is gonna transform our entire region, and the jobs that that's gonna create, the jobs in the manufacturing that's gonna come back to our region is gonna be unbelievable. Hi, Congressman, I'm here with "The Guardian." Do you pay attention to the U.S. Census numbers that came out recently that shows that the poverty rate in Youngstown is increasing and it's one of the highest in the country? I didn't think this was gonna be a political event, but I think we need to focus on what's happening here today and the positive news to revitalize industrial sites for redevelopment. Congressman, can I just ask one more question? Congressman? He's a U.S. congressman in a public space taking questions. You can ask whatever you want. Principle one of First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. I'd assumed more of the people at that event were journalists. But when you turn around and you realize that most of the people there are politicians and only two other journalists turn up for it, it's surreal, and it's deeply disturbing. Come on, Milesy. Good morning, good morning. Thank you, brother. Thank you so much. Can I get a cup of ice? Thank you. A new pandemic peak. On Friday, more than 30 states reported seeing increases in new COVID cases, Florida among them. The Sunshine State reported nearly 9,000 more COVID cases on Friday... Yeah, I'm with the "Miami Herald." Mm-hmm. - Hey! - Whoo! Trump 2020! Why do you support Donald J. Trump? Stacy, let's start with you. Trump 2020! Trump 2020! You got two minutes to talk to "The Guardian"? - I can't hear you. What's up? - I'm with "The Guardian." Can I ask you a couple of questions, Owen? - Sure. - Yeah? Yeah. So where did you come in from today? I'm sorry, what's that? Where have you come in from today? Can you take the mask off? I can't hear you, man. No, got to keep it on, I'm afraid. All right, then I'm out. You don't want to talk to me 'cause I'm wearing a mask? - I can't hear you. - You can hear me. What do you want me to say? You can hear exactly what I'm saying, come on. You know what? If you want to talk to me, you can take the mask off. So that's the condition of you giving me an interview? - Yeah. - That I'll have to... okay. I'm not gonna interview, then. Okay. - All right. - All right. Enjoy your slavery. Enjoy my slavery? Excuse me. Hi there. With "The Guardian" newspaper. Mind if I ask you a few questions? - Sure. - Yeah? Thank you. You know "The Guardian"? You read our stuff? Occasionally. Occasionally, okay. When you're telling the truth. Right. They're all the time beating us up on COVID, you know. Hello. Are you worried about the risks of COVID-19? No? No. You know, since March the 1st, there's only been two death certificates that says "cause of death: COVID-19." All of the other death certificates says "coronavirus-related." Do you not believe that the virus is deadly? I believe that most of those deaths are something else: heart attacks, pneumonia, flu. Cancer. All of that other stuff, and it's thrown in there to make people like you folks be scared all the time to wear a mask. Thank you very much. Nice to meet you both. Sometimes it feels like when you talk to people, you're living in two different realities. And that is really difficult to engage with as a reporter. If I write something and it's read by a certain person, it will be discredited and distrusted even if I have put in, you know, months of effort or days of effort to establish a fact or to tell a particular story that was incredibly hard to get. Like, you know, to lots and lots of people now, that just doesn't matter. Our streets! - Whose streets? Our streets! - Whose streets? Our streets! - No justice! No peace! No justice! No peace! - No justice! No peace! - No justice! No peace! - If we don't get it... Shut it down! If we don't get it... Shut it down! - If we don't get it... Shut it down! Oh, my gosh, we're moving. We're moving. We need to move! They opened fire. Look at them. They're aiming their fire now. They're working towards us. They're working... Get back! Get back! Get back! No, I'm a journalist! I'm a journalist! Who were they aiming that at? Now they're shooting at the photographer. At us! Like, directly at us. - Get down! Get down! - Move! Move! Move! Move! It hurts. It hurts. - Press, press. - Inside now! I am press. I don't care. Get down. Okay, I'm down. I'm down. - Stay! - Go inside! I'm press. Please... We are live on the air at the moment. I'm sorry? You're under arrest. Okay, do you mind telling me why I'm under arrest, sir? Why... why am I under arrest, sir? That is an American television reporter, Omar Jimenez, being led away by police officers. He clearly identified himself as a reporter. He was just taken into police custody live on television. In my 30 years of experience as a journalist, I have not seen this amount of harassment. It's not even harassment. It's intimidation. They knew the cameras were rolling, and they wanted to make a point. But freedom of the press is absolute. And that is one of the few things in that Constitution that is guaranteed. It's guaranteed more than equality. But the rules are changing now. Good morning, everybody. Let's get started. What's the latest from the U.S.? There have been protests every single day now for at least two weeks. More than 500 assaults of journalists documented. Nearly 140 detainments. That is utterly unprecedented in the United States. We're trying to help, but there is lack of safety training that American reporters have. They're going into these situations without anything. We didn't want to contemplate that there could be a scenario like the one we're living through now, but I'm concerned that press freedom in the United States is starting to look like many other countries around the world. Hayd√© Vald√©z Solano. Concepci√≥n Victoria Gonzalez. Dulce Janet Moreno Santiago. Veronica Andrade Sal√≠nas. Fernanda S√°nchez Velarde. No, no, no, no. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh. I mean, I love working for the "Herald." I love what I do. Been working there for 31 years. It's the only job I've known. Damn, it's been the majority of my adult life. When is this documentary coming out? I might be gone from the "Herald" by then. Oh, yeah. I think so. I don't know. I just have a funny feeling. Just have a funny feeling. It's my father, Viter Juste. He was a journalist. He made his own newspaper, "Ayiti Floridad," which he sold and printed and sold out of his record store just couple of miles north of here. You know, me and my dad didn't get to throw ball. We sat down and watched CBS News. Well, he made me watch it. "Frontline," "Montage." I mean, I could go down to "20/20." That's where we... That was our intersection. He would sit down and talk to me, and he would ask me questions about the news and current events and how I felt about it and... why do I feel that it's being reported that way? Kind of like defining the angles, you know? That's the legacy he's left for me. Hello, can I ask you a couple of quick questions? I'm a journalist from "The Guardian." Do you understand the impeachment process? - Yeah. - You do? Being from England, you understand the impeachment process? - Yeah, I do, yeah. - Okay. So you understand that you can impeach a president for anything. Where do you get that information from? What news source? Doesn't have to be any news source. Go on YouTube and look it up. Crowd: USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump! ‚ô™ And I'm proud to be an American ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Where at least I know I'm free ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And I won't forget the men who died ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Who gave that right to me ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And I gladly stand up next to you ‚ô™ ‚ô™ And defend her still today ‚ô™ ‚ô™ 'Cause there ain't no doubt ‚ô™ ‚ô™ I love this land ‚ô™ ‚ô™ God bless the USA ‚ô™ We love you! We love you! We love you! We love you! We love you! We love you! We love you! We love you! - And I love you too. I love you too. We're all in this together. Well, look at all the press at this time, and just look at that. The fake news following us. Crowd: CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks! Globalism will not win! Fuck you! Crowd: CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks! Fake news coming through! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! No more fake news! You are the enemy of the people! Fake news, go home! Fake news, go home! Fake news, go home! Fake news, go home! Fake news, go home! Fake news! Fake news! Fake news! Fake news! Fake news! Fake news! Fake news! Fake news! Fake news! Fake news! Fake news! How's Mum doing? I'm just, yeah, a bit tired and, yeah, burned out. Yeah. Block it out and try and do your job. I have a lot of competing and conflicting emotions, you know, being in this country. But I really believe that the work that we do is more important than it ever has been. And I've been trying to sort of stay focused on that. I have driven thousands of miles throughout this election season, and it has often felt like reporting in two parallel dimensions where objective facts have given way to disinformation and flat-out lies and mistruth have become mainstream. I'm still unsure whether any sort of victory has the power to reunite this fractured nation. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. Bonjour, bonjour. Is the poochie barking for Biden? Hello, I'm from "The Guardian" newspaper. Are you worried about votes being counted, given that Trump has said that he might not trust the outcome of this election? I don't either. I'd say they're popping champagne. All lives matter! All lives matter! All lives matter! All lives matter! We must fight for our country. America first. Joe Biden did not win this presidential election. You know it. I know it. We all know it. We're gonna fight. We're not gonna let it happen. Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! I want to ask you guys to stay in these streets, to stay out here every day until we get these election results. We need to fight. This is the most important election the United States has ever seen. Whose streets? Our streets! - Whose streets? Our streets! - Whose streets? Our streets! God bless America, and God bless President Donald J. Trump. Yes! Excuse me, hey, do you mind if I have a quick chat with you? - Yeah, of course. - I'm with "The Guardian." You're with the Proud Boys, right? I'm the chairman. You're the chairman of the Proud Boys. What evidence is there that this election has been stolen? The unprecedented number of turnout that we had in Wisconsin, 90% turnout, which has never happened. We're seeing, in Michigan, the same thing, the recount, overcount. We're seeing people... Overcoun... what do you mean by overcount? What we're seeing in Michigan is, people that are dead are on this voter roll, and we've seen already a couple that have voted. What do you say to people who say that you're spreading dangerous and baseless misinformation? I don't care about those people. Those people, to me, I consider them retards. Retards? Yes, I do consider them retards. People that think that I'm a danger or there is a danger... No, I said that the information that you're spreading... Or disinformation that you're spreading is dangerous... Yeah? And it's designed to stoke up anger and hatred. Well, I could tell them to go fuck themselves. People like you don't have the facts, and you ask these questions without doing your research. That exact reason is why we fight the media and that why we say "fake news." Good morning, everybody. North America. There is a large MAGA rally planned for D.C. I mean, it could be nothing, but it could also very easily spiral into something awful. It's probably worth sharing protest advice. You know, this is a very, very difficult situation to advise on because you just can never tell on the day what threats are gonna materialize on the ground. USA! USA! USA! USA! The American people do not believe the corrupt fake news anymore. Over the past several weeks, we've amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election. People are not going to take it any longer. Fuck you! Fuck you! Let's go! Fuck CNN! We'll see you later, fake news. You guys can piss the hell off! Whoa, whoa, hey! Hey! Hey! I will not tolerate fake news no more! Calm down. Hey, hey, hey! Hey! I've seen that video a few times, and I still find it shocking every time I watch it. But this has been stoked for the past five years. And I think if anybody says that they're... That this is an aberration, it's just not true. I mean, it's the culmination of... the war Trump has waged on the press for his entire tenure in office. It's so difficult to know whether what happened at the Capitol is the end of an era or the beginning of something even more sinister. And I honestly don't know. It's just kind of, in my view, impossible to predict. This doesn't go away with the swearing in of a new president. Looks like a Klansman. I just gotta make one beautiful frame. This is what I want. Eva, good morning, and it will be an inauguration like we have never seen before, all of it playing out against the backdrop of a raging pandemic and increased threats of violence. Hey, Orlando, I shot some stuff at the Capitol, as close as I can get. I'm gonna move the pictures to you right now. - Okay. - Okay? Send it over. Come on, baby Black Jesus. Come on. Here we go. Let me see. Trump is gone, but he's left ashes. And that soot stays with us. It's not something that, you know, you could dust off. It is something that stains your hands, that is in your lungs. And I think we have to learn to at least live with it for a little while. I am at the twilight of my career. I've been very blessed to be an asset to the fourth estate. But the mantle has been passed on to these younger journalists, and that gives me encouragement. All: ‚ô™ Happy birthday, dear Miles ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Happy birthday to you ‚ô™ Blow, blow, blow, blow, quick. Ah, my face! Are you sure you should light that inside? - Yeah. - It's fine. That's the fire alarm. Oh, here it comes. Here it comes. This is your birthday sunrise. This is God's candle to you, my man. You think you'll be doing this with me when you're 17? Only time will tell. Hey, Orlando. Hey, Carl, are you out on the street already? Hi, Councilman Pritt, this is Oliver Laughland calling from "The Guardian" newspaper. - What do we want? Justice! - When do we want it? Now! - What do we want? Justice! - When do we want it? Now! It's hard work. It's a difficult job. But we can do something to better society. If you're interested, let us hear from you.
