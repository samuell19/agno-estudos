"The world is a nasty place," "and I'm no better. But we must try to improve it." "This is why I'm here: To do something." NORTH AFRICA TOUBKAL MOUNTAINS - AL HAOUZ Why were you at the embassy? What did you tell the police? Nothing. Tell me, or I'll kill your mother, your wife and your children. Talk, you son of a bitch! Who did you talk to? Speak! Who did you talk to? They saw him. It was him! No! You son of a bitch! Don't you understand? Die, you bastard! ALCAZAR DE SAN JUAN PENITENTIARY CIUDAD REAL - SPAIN Igor! How the hell did they let you out? What, did you lose your voice? From moaning while getting fucked? - No. You know why? - Why, man? Because my ass is yours, my friend! I know. Look, this is Vanessa. She's my friend. Part of the team. Nice to meet you. Hi. I think you'll be more comfortable in that car. I brought you a present. The kind of present you like. A welcome cocktail. Ladies, take care of my friend. Be patient with him, he hasn't gotten laid in three months. Hi, girls! Don't be scared. Get your ass in the car. ALFONSO CASTROVIEJO'S HOUSE AIGUABLAVA-SA TUNA - CATALONIA - SPAIN Well? Did you enjoy the ride? Come on, I'll introduce you to the others. You handled it well. Very well. Castroviejo wants to talk to you later. Lemas. He will lead the way with you. Willy de Berg, a former rally driver. He got caught in a doping control. Tested positive for coke. He was disqualified. Lost his license. He's a has-been, but he's good. He'll be hot on your tail. Saïd will be right behind. As the carrier. And I will close the convoy. Why Saïd? He will fuck everything up. You know that, right? Chris insisted. He usually works with him. Come. Well, well! Igor! How are you, buddy? I'm great, thanks. I hope they treated you well. It could've been worse. I tried to get you out sooner, but the DA was tough. Overly zealous. We had to set up a sex scandal with one of the girls. To have him by the balls. Listen... Did you really have to beat up a cop in front of everybody? You could've caused us big trouble. The police here aren't like in France. I don't give a shit. He was high and asking for it. Thanks for keeping quiet and for being patient. You know where your room is. Take a shower, get rid of that smell and enjoy. You leave in two days. Thanks. How was prison? Good? Did you have to bend over at all? Shut the fuck up. Give me a phone. The guards took mine. No phones until you leave. These are for the job. Ask that asshole who thinks he's Escobar. Does he know you call him that? Don't tell him, please. I don't give a shit! Really! He's not my dad. Fuck him and his cowboy boots. Who do you wanna call? The narcs, asshole, to say we're about to leave. Shut up, tell me. My girl, it's been three months. You stupid or what? Just ask me. I was with her every night. Leïla. She's from Paris. She'll be with me. To go through customs? She has "junkie" written all over her. What's your problem? I don't know you. Come on, don't you start. Don't worry, I know her. "Don't worry…" Go jerk off in the shower. That guy's crazy. And you, shut up with your bullshit. NECKER HOSPITAL - PARIS CHILDREN'S UNIT The victims are Jérôme Bannel and Ali Ben Hamid. 13 and 15 years old. They've been hospitalized for ten days. One for cardiac trouble. The other for a transplant. We've called Jérôme's parents. They're in Marseilles. Nothing from Ali's parents. The dad has been missing for a month. The mom is nowhere to be found. Hey, Doc. Hi, Richard. You're looking for two suspects. One used an awl to pierce Bannel's heart, and his roommate got his throat cut with a large blade, like a hunting or an army knife. I'll leave you to it. I'll see you at the autopsy. Are you gonna do it? Why, is there another option? Kids are not your thing. They're no one's thing. Okay… Good luck. SAVINOSA BEACH TARRAGONA - SOUTHERN CATALONIA TOWN OF VERDUN-SUR-GARONNE D6 AND A62 JUNCTION What's the story? Roadblock, breathalyzer testing. Fucking Tony tried to force it. So we've got a dead informer, and Prat wants to talk to you. It doesn't sound good. Yeah, we're waiting for forensics. I don't know. Let's say… One hour. I'll call you back. Okay, bye. Sure. Bye. So? So what? Sara… For once, don't misjudge my intellect and deductive skills. The driver was one of your informers. The furniture and valuables we found in the back were stolen from that asshole, Deruisseau. The one you and your narcs - had to deal with many times. - And? And… I know that you and your buddy Fontana were on a stake-out at his house that night. TOULOUSE PONT DES DEMOISELLES AREA Bob for Sara. Do you copy? I'm listening. We've got a patrol squad coming your way. Copy. Captain Bellaïche, drug squad. Doing a stake-out with my team. And you saw nothing? A coincidence. It's over, get out of here. Anti-Crime is onto us. If they find you, we're screwed. So shut up and move. Do what you want, but all your bullshit, the disciplinary board won't buy it. They'll strip you down and pick you apart, you see? What I see is a dead driver, and 300 kilograms of cocaine ruined. What? You're crazy. - There's a ton of stuff left. - I'm crazy? - You should be grateful. - No, you should. Okay, watch your ass. Yeah, right. You'll get my report tonight. You know what covering up a robbery for intel means. If they find out, you're done. Who was the deal with? Nino Braghanti. Huge drug delivery. Three hundred kilograms of coke from Morocco. Any news from Reynald? Nothing yet. It's been three months. Is he still on our side? What do the higher-ups say? They don't give a shit. They don't even know he exists. Maybe he's cozied up in a brothel in Malaga, getting a blow job from a whore. I'll go pay. It's late. How's everything? Good. The men are loading up. You leave tomorrow at 8:00. Are you ready? Where is the delivery? The best trip is the one we dream of, not the one we know of. More details tomorrow, when you get on that bike. I won't leave unless I know where I'm going. See that bull over there? The biggest one. That's my best bull. It'll be on a bullfight in Madrid in ten days. - I named it Flamma. You know why? - No. Flamma was a Syrian slave in Roman times. He became a gladiator. And if we know his name, it's because, four times, he refused the rudis, the wooden sword given to winners that granted them their freedom. Of course, Flamma died at age 30. He chose to keep fighting. Out of bravery or perhaps out of vanity. What this story tells us is the fate of an unappreciative man. Or he didn't listen to reason. Knowing who I'm going with and where I'm heading when I have to hit the road and move six million euros worth of dope... That's listening to reason. Either you trust me, or I'm out. The delivery is in Carcassonne. Half is going to Paris and half to Toulouse. - Does that work for you? - Good enough. Thanks for the history lesson. What do you think? He barks like a Frenchman, but he has the balls of a Mexican. But gets hard like a Spaniard! - If you want, you can have him. - No! Igor! Come on, let's go! CRIMINAL POLICE TOULOUSE HQ CHIEF COMMISSIONER PRAT'S OFFICE (NARCOTICS AND VICE SQUAD) Come in. Reynald just sent a text. They leave tomorrow. - Do we have a delivery point? - Carcassonne. So, both kids were last seen by the day team around 3:40 p.m. BASTION 36 BATIGNOLLES Still alive. The bodies were found by the intern on the night shift around 6:00 p.m. The only visit they'd had was Ben Hamid's mother. What about her? Still missing? A cousin of hers, Tarik Badoumi, has been putting her up in a room above a local shop. She was seen a few days ago, leaving for the hospital around noon, nothing since. Okay, what else? He met two people from their village three days ago. The description matches a couple on the hospital cameras. Lucie made the connection. On the footage, I saw a van arriving at the hospital at 5:09 p.m. They parked in the yard where we found the bodies. Two people. A man, North African, wearing a nurse's coat, a hat and sunglasses. And a woman wearing a veil. They get in the building, they come out 30 minutes later and leave in a hurry. We can't see their faces, but it matches. Franck, get a warrant to get access to the phone records. - Okay. - Look for matching numbers inside the hospital or nearby. Lucie, focus on Mrs. Ben Hamid. Get a missing person notice around the country. What about the van? Fake plates, black Citroën Jumpy, but that's all we got. Okay, send the description and the fake plate number, and explain that they're dangerous. When you're done, go home and get some sleep. We've got long days ahead. - Let's go. - Okay. POLICE STATION CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION PERPIGNAN Evening. Toulouse drug squad. - Chief Molins is expecting us. - Okay. Toulouse drug squad. They're here to see Chief Molins. Molins? He's already drunk. Come back tomorrow. After 12:00. He's with hookers tonight. He'll be in bed late. Just kidding. We were expecting you. We made paella. Charles! - What? - Toulouse drug squad is here. You can go. - Viking, nice to meet you. - Sara. Bob. What's that on your face? Your wife's number. Good one. You're quick. Charles Molins. Head of the drug squad. Welcome home. Sara Bellaïche. Bob Fontana, my deputy. - Hi. - Sorry for the racket. We're celebrating the new captain. Victor Picmal, second in the squad, but you can call him Viking. We've met. How about a nice aperitif? Sure. I've sent you the procedure. Did you have a look? Yes. We're not in luck. There isn't much. It's gonna be hard. Why haven't you talked to the Spanish? Castroviejo bribes the local police. Some cover deliveries. We wanted to be discreet. If he's got the drugs, why don't you go to him? We want the guy on the receiving end. Nino Braghanti. Do you know what he did in Thailand? - What now? - I'll be quick. We robbed a million. He booked the flights. Thailand. So he wants to visit Thailand? No, he wants to fuck. Yeah! He doesn't even stop at the hotel. He goes straight to Patong, finds the first hooker there, and… All night long, he screws her. He has a cigarette in the morning. The girl plays with his balls for 30 minutes. And he tells the girl, "Listen, I like that, but why do you keep playing with my balls?" "They're like mine before the surgery." Bastard! - Yes! - Come on! Please, could you keep it down? Excuse me? You heard me. I'm with my family here. We don't want your dirty stories. - Nino! - Thank you. Forget it. It's not worth it. Forget it. Come on, don't. No. - Not tonight. - Screw you. Fuck. Who do you think you are to talk to me that way? - It's okay. - You think it's funny? Should I slit your throat? - It's okay. - Piece of shit! What are you looking at? Eat. Eat! And that asshole has got greasy hair. Let's get out of here. Time of death, 48 hours ago. Around the time she went missing. Looks like her throat was cut, then dumped in the water. It was probably the same knife used to kill her kid. Similar wounds, same scars around the pharynx and the cartilage. I'll know more after the autopsy. But it's likely that it's the same killer. Any leads? A couple in a black van. Okay. If it helps, there were no signs of struggle or defensive wounds on the kid. Same for the mother, apparently. Which means neither of them suspected anything, so they must have known their assailant. I'll leave you with the river patrol. Okay, guys. You can take the body. Okay, thanks. The lab just called about the samples taken in the hospital room. Two different DNAs, but nothing in our records. And by the river? Their cameras recorded a black van on the riverbank, two nights ago, around the Austerlitz viaduct. A couple throws a body in the water. The descriptions match. We'll get a copy. So, I used a special program and isolated one cellphone number located in our three locations. Necker Hospital, Tarik Badoumi's home, Mrs. Ben Hamid's cousin, and a street close to the viaduct where they dumped her. Did you check the number? Yes, it's a chip bought in a shop in Rougemont, in Sevran, in the Seine-Saint-Denis department. But the chip is still active. What do you mean? There were calls made from Spain the last two days. - And it's the same chip? - And same number. Where in Spain? A small village in Aiguablava in Catalonia. They're about to leave. How do you know Reynald? Crime training four years ago. Why didn't it work out? Because of the drugs. He couldn't handle it. He started liking the product. What about you? Never touched this crap. And you? Yes, when I started. Drawers were full of them. Then I met a 15-year-old girl who overdosed. Made me think about my girl. I was ashamed. If anything comes up, let me know. On the highway, keep 500 meters away from the cars and Igor's and Lemas' bikes. They'll be leading the way in front of us. We'll communicate via text messages. Call only to signal danger or an emergency. If anyone calls for anything besides what they're getting paid for, I will kill them. Is that clear? Come on, move! You're late. I can't even piss? Saïd. You're in charge. You know what that means, right? Yes. Of course. - Have a safe trip. - Thanks, boss. See you in Carcassonne. Good luck. SEVRAN, ROUGEMONT We were finishing the patrol when we found it. We checked the notice. It's the car you're looking for. - How long has it been here? - We don't have any witnesses. You won't find any around here. Yeah, I figured. You two check the neighborhood. I'll see their contacts. Be careful. You never know what's behind those doors. Who is it? Police, ma'am. We have a few questions. What is it about? With a closed door, It's gonna be a bit difficult. - Come in. - Thank you. Take this stuff off. You're safe here. Can I get you anything? Beer, wine, coffee? A glass of white wine? No, thanks. As you wish. Daniel. My husband. He was a cop, like you. See? You're safe here. Where is he now? At the cemetery. He got shot 20 years ago during a robbery. He died. A young trainee died too. She was your age. How can I help? Here. Sit down. It's about the burned out van in the parking lot. I saw them. Two people. They arrived, set the van on fire and left. Did you see them? It was dark. But they were Arabs. What time was it? Around 3 or 4 a.m. I don't sleep much. So I like watching them mess around at the window. My Daniel had taught me that. He'd write everything down. I do the same. Here. It's all there. Here. Look. It's got everything you need. Names, dates… license plates, IDs, phone numbers, and… I tapped them. In the mail boxes and in the basement, to listen to them. They're so stupid! - Did you write all of this? - Yes. There's always something going on in this dump. - And the pictures? - Also me. I use this. My son-in-law prints them. It's his hobby. If I don't have time, I use my phone. So you took a picture of the people who burned the van? Of course, I did. They're not printed yet. When my son-in-law has them, they're yours. Who's that "Chris"? Chris Rehlinger, the gangster of the neighborhood. He's responsible for all the drug traffic. He's in Building D, top floor. Don't go to him. He's rotten to the bone. I'm listening. The cops raided the place. Did they talk to you? No, they're about to leave. Then why are you boring me with this? Bastard, he hung up on me. Go fuck yourself, son of a bitch! Fucking asshole. Can you stop taking that shit? I'm talking to you. Why did you become such a loser? No reason. Nothing happened. You're pathetic, I swear. Come on, speed up. And don't miss the radars. What is it? Radar at km 110. Okay. I'll warn the others. Slow down, cops. - We got a text. - I can't read. Do you want us to get killed? So? Listen to me. I'm responsible for you now. So shut up and do as I say! What's up with you? Are you okay? What the hell? Fuck! Fuck you! What the fuck? Leïla, look at me. Are you okay? Hey! Fucking answer me! Shit. Fuck. Fuck. You're pissing me off. What did you take, Leïla? I'm talking to you. Fucking annoying. I don't have time for this. Why today? Leïla, can you hear me? Shit. Is there a problem? No. No problem. My wife… sick. My wife. Everything's fine. Thank you. - Step away from the car. - Step away? - Step away from the car! - I don't understand. Sorry. The car registration? - Sir, step away from the car, please! - Just a moment. Motherfuckers. Leïla. Leïla! What is it, asshole? - She's dead. - Leave her here. - Eduardo... - Fucking throw her out! Why did you stop here, asshole? There was a problem. There was a problem? I swear, Eduardo! I swear! No! - Stop! - Choose an eye, asshole. Left or right? Please! It's not my fault, I swear! Get in the car, asshole. Get in the fucking car! We take the first exit. We have a problem. We're getting off the highway. Shit. We've got a problem. They left the highway. They took the RN9 to Figueres. What the hell? Gunshots on Villa Delmus rest stop. It's your guys. They've killed three Spanish cops. Do we go check? - Okay. - Let's go. Go. - Do you know her? - I've never seen her. I spoke to the chief of operations. They've got a witness. A junkie up there. He mentioned two black cars. Two shooters. Description matches Garcia and Masriche. They took off without the girl. And her? Nothing. No ID, no phone. We'll know more after we've run her fingerprints and DNA. What do you have? They went inland. They'll probably try to hide. Do we wait to bust them? We'll do it in Carcassonne. They have to deliver. And your source? Nothing for now. SANTA CECÍLIA ROAD GIRONA - CATALONIA Good morning, sir. What's going on? We had to stop here because of the weather. We'd like to spend the night here. What's up, champ? What's your name? - Pablo. - My son. Pablo. How old are you? - Tell him. - Eight. Listen, Pablo. Would you spend the night out here with your family? You wouldn't, right? Why don't you tell your dad to let us stay with you? The easy way. Don't be afraid. Come. - Richard? - Yeah? About the fingerprints, we've got a match. The female DNA found in the kids' room matches a body found on the road after a shootout in Spain. Leïla Hamoudni. From Morocco. I asked for details about the shootout, but the Civil Guard is on high alert. Three of their guys got killed, and her accomplices took off. How many? Two, apparently. In two separate cars. Could they be our killers? What are they doing in Spain? I don't know. If her DNA matches the DNA at the hospital, our second killer was probably with her. I called the drug squad. Toulouse and Perpignan are going to catch them at the border. Maybe you should go there, right? Very tasty, ma'am. Thank you. You're very kind. You're welcome. What makes someone a good or a bad person? Their actions? Their thoughts? Or the damn fate? Do storms scare you? There's no reason to be afraid, Pablito. You know what my aunt used to say? That whenever there's a thunderstorm, God is peeling potatoes. He drops them in a big iron pot. Every thunderclap you hear is one of God's potatoes falling into that pot. Lightning won't strike nettles. Hey, bro. - Yes? - Hi, Eduardo. What is it? Hang on. I told our friends in Paris and Toulouse about our problem. The delivery will be tomorrow morning. I'll text you the new meeting location when I know about it. When it's done, kill that douche bag Saïd. RIVESALTES AIRPORT PERPIGNAN - Hi. - Hi. - Chief Cross, Paris Crimes. - Sara Bellaïche. My deputy, Bob Fontana. Hi. Get in. We're going to the station. What's the connection? These dealers don't really kill kids in Paris before moving drugs - from Spain. - I know. I'm here to get the answer. And if you don't? I always do. Excuse me. Yeah? Richard, I've got big news for you. Okay, tell me. Leïla Hamoudni, she's from the same village as Ben Hamid, in Rif Mountains. The results are in. So the missing father might be dead too. Or he's the killer. I don't know. His description doesn't match the videos. He could've paid someone. It looks more like revenge or a settling of scores. What about the Hamoudnis? Generations of dealers in the Chefchaouen region in the border of the Rif. Mostly cannabis and kif culture. And coke recently, through their European network. I want a file on each of them and keep looking for the father. I'll call you when I've got something. - Okay. - Bye. Bye. I left Paris in a hurry. Can we stop to get some toiletries? Can I find that around here? We also brush our teeth here. We'll sort it out. Cover your ears, Pablito, because we're going to make a lot of noise. Please. Take them to the basement. Come with me. You too. Where are they now? On a farm in Santa Cecília, in Girona. I sent one of my team. We can't set up surveillance. They'd spot us immediately. And the marker is our only way to follow them? Delivery is in Carcassonne. They have to cross the border. We'll have a team at the Puigcerdà border, and another one at Bourg-Madame. When they're through, we tail them on the N116 with Montpellier, Bordeaux and Toulouse BRI. They're on stand-by. Okay. And how does it end? They meet with Braghanti, and we bust them. Hopefully, your second killer will be there too. What about the boss in Paris? They've killed three cops in Spain. They're too dangerous. - Do you have an idea? - Maybe. We've identified Chris Rehlinger. He's Saïd Masriche's cousin. And Leïla Hamoudni's ex. He controls the drug dealing in the area where we found the van the killers used. The other part of the delivery must be for him. How do you know that? We have a special witness on site. An old lady living in one of the buildings. She watches everyone all the time. She saw Rehlinger preparing a car. I spoke to that asshole. We're good for tomorrow at 6 a.m. So I'll text you the delivery point. Okay, move your butts. Enjoy the trip. Bring back the stuff. A BMW X6, fake plates, and two thugs in it. They left an hour ago. We should see them in Carcassonne. I have pictures on my phone. So let your squad know to expect them at the toll and follow the car to Carcassonne. They're on their way. And we nab them all at once there. Hi, honey. It's Dad. I just wanted to say that I'm thinking about you. And… I love you. Who's that special witness? A reliable source that we're protecting. Anyway, good job. For a cop from Paris? That's right. The 4x4 attracts less attention. Meeting in Carcassonne. FRENCH CUSTOMS I'm gonna take a piss. Hello? Eight o'clock. Carcassonne Citadel. Let's go, guys! Carcassonne Citadel, 8:00 a.m. Let's go! Let's go, guys! Remember that they're a big bunch of assholes, so be careful. Not like last time. Everybody gets back home, okay? Let's go, Vik. What the fuck? Were you taking a piss or jacking off? Hurry up! Our Parisian friends passed the toll. We're tailing them, heading your way. CITADEL - CARCASSONNE Authority to Sara. Our friends are in the city. Dropping the tail, you should see them soon. Copy. Sara. Max to Sara. We can see them on their way to you. Our friends stopped next to our friend. I'll give you the go-ahead once they deliver. Meeting at this time, in the city center, in a parking lot? There's something wrong. Attention everyone. The convoy is here. I repeat, convoy is here. Coming your way. That's what's wrong. Field trip. Those assholes had it all planned. We've got a problem. A school bus just parked. They're gonna hide behind the kids. In broad daylight. Those fucking assholes! - How are you? - Good. Everything okay? Did you have any trouble? No. No trouble. Just a slight delay. - Let's go. - It was a pleasure. They're leaving. We'll let the 4x4 and the motorcycles go before the rest. - Police! - Police! Out! Police! Don't move! Get out! Out! Let's go! Out! Your hands! - Okay! - Your hands! Out! Get out! Go! - Hands up! - I'm innocent! Shut the fuck up! - Don't move! - Stop! - Your hands. - Handcuff him. Franck. What's up? About the girl, Leïla Hamoudni… I've looked everywhere. Family, background, friends… No record. She just arrived in France. No friends, no connections. I'm waiting to hear from the Homeland officer in Morocco. And you? We just busted a part of the team. We're missing one, Saïd Masriche. Could be our second killer. They think he killed the cops from the Civil Guard. He was driving a 4x4 Range Rover registered to Santi Camaro. He was shot in the head. His body was on his farm. You get the picture. They're completely nuts. I'll ask for DNA samples for all the suspects arrested for you to compare. See if the boss will let you help the office guys. They're gonna bust Alfonso Castroviejo tomorrow in Spain. He's the big boss. He knows everybody. The fucking DNA we're looking for might be at his place. Bye. Good luck. Thanks. Talk later. LA LERGUE VALLEY HÉRAULT DEPARTMENT Hey! - What the fuck? - Nobody's picking up. - Call again! - What do you think I'm doing? Hey bro, the cops were there. I'm telling you. - Did you see them? - He told me. - Did you? - In the parking lot. What the fuck? It was too fucking late. You're a dumb-ass. Yes, Saïd, what's up? We're fucked. Where are you? I don't know. In the woods by a lake. It's not that. The cops showed up. What do you mean? I don't know. They were already there. Where's the stuff? I've got it. Are Hossam and Marley with you? No, they're getting their dicks sucked. Of course, they're here! Watch your mouth and listen. Put everything in the BMW. Change the plates and get to the city. Take small roads, okay? Okay. Saïd, there's a fucking mole in your team. What do you mean? Someone ratted you out to the cops. Who's with you? Igor and Lemas. It has to be one of them. What did he say? Saïd! Whoa! Who's the mole? - Motherfuckers! - What's wrong with you? Do you think there's a mole? That we would have taken all those risks? Shut the fuck up. It's not me or them. What the hell, Saïd? That's bullshit. Son of a bitch. Okay, we're looking for the two vehicles that managed to escape. The driver, Saïd Masriche. A suspect in the murder of our Spanish colleagues and involved in the double homicide at Necker. Case lead, Chief Cross, from Paris Criminal Police. Thank you, sir. Right now, the two other men with Saïd Masriche who drove the BMW haven't been identified, but we know that they're doing business with a local dealer. Chris Rehlinger. Okay, we've got checkpoints in strategic positions, and I have asked that an immediate plan be put in place to locate both vehicles as quickly as possible. There's also an operation planned tomorrow morning to put Alfonso Castroviejo under arrest in his house in Catalonia, with the help of the drug squad in Spain. Any questions? Any news from our motorbike friend? No. The tracker was still on the car we found, and he's not answering his phone. Maybe we should ask Paris to set up surveillance around Rehlinger. And try to be there for delivery. Impossible. They're everywhere. They'd spot us. They've got all the cops on their asses. The plan is gonna change. Can your source help us? We've got a team at her apartment. We'll know if there's movement. We're gonna bring in Braghanti, Garcia and the others to Toulouse. The magistrate will question them there. In the meantime, we're gonna grill them. We'll leave it to you. What about the guns we found in your vehicle? Were those for tourism, too? Those guns are not mine. And neither is the car. It's a rental car. I don't know how the guns got there. Someone must have left them there. You're going to need another approach to your defense, Garcia. I don't think the judge will put up with your arrogance. If you have more questions, talk to my lawyer. He'll answer all of your questions. And now, cutie, why don't you and I have some fun? You can suck my dick, you dirty whore. What? Watch your mouth. Shut your fucking mouth. Got it? Willy, you're in deep shit. Drug trafficking, criminal conspiracy, complicity to first-degree murder. That's a lot for a guy who used to get on podiums after a race and spray Champagne among sexy chicks. How the fuck did you end up there? I'm not gonna play the nice cop. I don't think you'll survive in jail. But I'm sure you can help us, and the judge will remember that. I've got a ten-year-old girl. If I talk, they'll start with her. But I can tell you one thing. Leïla, the girl we left on the road, did something awful in Paris. I overheard her talking about it with Eduardo. It had to be the boys in Necker. She mentioned a guy named was with her. If it helps… Why are you telling me this? The drugs, that's on me. But I would never hurt kids. Hey. Do you have a cigarette? A job to fucking harass people. Motherfucking slackers. Jewelry and personal belongings, of course… Do you want to join me? Do you have something to tell me? We don't have to talk. We can do a lot of stuff here. Really? Like what? If you're gonna search my ass, call an ambulance now. Use your imagination. Whores and gangster girls are not my thing. It's procedure. I don't care about procedure! But she can touch it. I don't mind. You'll get plenty of that in jail, Mr. Braghanti. In your dreams, bitch. I'll be out before they even think about it. And keep your doors locked, bitch. Or what? - I don't talk to bitches. - Or? Your mouth and your ass won't be - big enough for… - Enough! Son of a bitch! I'm gonna show you procedure, asshole! I'm okay. No more punching or I'll break your arm, got it? Shut up. Shut up, okay? That's procedure. So shut up, asshole! Thank you for stepping in earlier. It wasn't just me. But you took the hit. Looks good on you. It stands out from the tie and cufflinks. It breaks the good guy look. It's pretty hot. What's your life like? Married? Yes. For a long time? Yes. Do you have kids? Yeah, a 15-year-old girl. Why do you ask? We met two days ago. We may never see each other again after tomorrow. We don't need to know each other to do a good job. I was just making small talk. Do you want to talk? Why did you let Reynald go with that fucking Masriche? You chose to protect your friend over arresting a cop killer with 150 kilograms of coke. What would you have done? Would you have taken that risk? Okay… You've seen too many deaths. You've breathed too much blood. It ruined your heart and brain. I'm sorry. I'm not used to talking about me. My wife left three months ago. My daughter left with her and ignores me. So you're on the market, then. Yes? Okay, let me know when you get the results. What's wrong? A patrol found the motorbikes and the car burned out by a lake two hours away. They found a dead body inside. They don't know if it's Reynald. Police! On the ground! Don't move! Don't move! Police! Hands up! Hands up! Easy. Easy. So? They've looked everywhere. No sign of Castroviejo. Someone could've warned him. We found about 20 million euros in cash inside a fake wall in the basement. He wouldn't leave it here. And you didn't take any? - To do what? - I don't know. Take me out to a fancy restaurant. You need to deserve it. Hey! Freeze, you son of a bitch! Drop the gun! On the ground! Put your hands up! Put the gun down! Drop the gun! Get on the ground! - Put it down! - Hands up! - Hands up! - Get on the ground! Do as I say! Put the gun down! I'm gonna check it out. There was an accident. No side exit? Doesn't look like it. I'll keep you posted. Sara to everyone. We're stuck because of an accident. You better have good stories. It's gonna take a while. So? I'm listening. You and your cop friends, you must have stories to tell. Stories for children. Not for assholes like you. Prat, we've got time for a cigarette. We don't. Shut up. Not in the mood. I've got to pee. Not a chance. - Hold it, honey. - I can't. What the hell? Hey! Drop your gun! Viking died during surgery. And Bob? Still under observation. Yes. Okay… I spoke to your deputy, Captain Darcheville. No DNA found at Castroviejo's house matches with your samples. But the body found in Masriche's burned car wasn't Reynald. It's a guy named Lemas Abramczik. A former mercenary with a record. Drug trafficking, armed robbery… Will you be okay? Yes, I'll be okay. Okay, let's move. It's not over yet. Please! Mr. Deruisseau! What's all this? Deruisseau. Braghanti's lawyer. He called them. - Where's that asshole? - Behind you. He'd like to talk to his client as soon as possible, Captain. He's gonna have to wait for the police officer in charge to remand his client into custody. Mr. Braghanti was arrested with 150 kilograms of cocaine in his car. So if you want to get him out of this shit, I'd suggest you swap your lawyer's robe for boots. You're gonna have to dig deep. Any news from Reynald? Nothing. At least he's alive. In the BMW with the other assholes. They're going to Paris. They were caught on camera at 6:00 p.m. near Dijon. The road control center had the wanted notice from our service and called us. But we don't know where the delivery will be. They could change cars. What do you suggest? De Berg gave me a name. A man named Waheed. He could be involved in the double homicide. The criminal police are checking. It could be a lead. A North African man was seen with Rehlinger in a Benz. We're trying to find the owner. Nothing so far. We're wasting our time here. It will end in Paris. I agree. Sara, go to Paris with Cross. Molins, stay with me. We have to deal with De Berg and Braghanti. And Viking's wife and kids. Come in. Your witnesses are here. Escorted by the Spanish cops. How did they get in? Through the entrance. - Did anyone see them? - I don't know. Put them in the break room. They can't be seen alive. De Berg said Reynald was supposed to kill them. If they publish it, he's dead. Did you talk to your client? I did. How is he feeling? He's fine. Did you know about this international drug trafficking? He is honest and retired, and too old for drug trafficking. He's the victim of a conspiracy orchestrated by some police officers to restore their image with the disciplinary board after questionable cases very similar to this one. I'll leave it at that, but trust me, I'll break this case down piece by piece to reveal the true motivations of those who were leading this case. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. It seems like the Toulouse police have long been working on this drug-trafficking matter with the Spanish police. In Spain, this drug case has led to many casualties, and while we thought all members of the Camaro family had been killed, we've just found out that the Civil Guard found the mother and her son alive. Son of a bitch! - Franck Darcheville. - Sara. - I'll take your bags. - Thanks. Thank you. These pictures were taken by Juliette Dazin at her place. We see Rehlinger with someone who strongly resembles our killer on the cameras by the river and at the hospital. They're driving a Mercedes E-Class. We've checked the plates. Rehlinger has been renting it for a few weeks. It's the "Dandy," as Dazin calls him, who drives it. Lucie checked the plates against the speeding tickets archives. There's been two tickets addressed to Rehlinger, but with a different address. 13, Rue de I'Université, Paris. We've searched the building, and we found an apartment leased to SCI Nabrebi. Give me the phone. It's me. We'll deliver at the other location. Let's go. We went there and searched the place, but they cleaned everything and left. We asked the caretaker, and she had no idea who they were. Is there a problem? No, don't worry. Rehlinger is checking up on us. We found some DNA on a toothbrush in the bathroom. We're waiting. Willy De Berg snitched on Nawabi. Willy is one of the guys we arrested. If the DNA matches, it'll prove that he's our killer. And he was identified by someone from the hospital. He was responsible for him when he was an intern there. He was working when they were killed. - What about Nawabi? - No record in our services. When we first checked, we discovered he and Leïla are from the same village. Our colleagues in Morocco confirmed that both families know each other. They share the cannabis market. It could be all about some turf war. And they'd kill kids for that? What about Jérôme Bannel? It's not about him. Could be for revenge. Or collateral damage. We should set up a surveillance operation around the area. Inside, it would get out of control. We'll put teams on points of entry of the Seine-Saint Denis department. We'll ask the anti-crime unit to increase patrols and bust them when we find the car. We can't let Reynald get there with all the shit from the media. Dazin just texted. Rehlinger has left the area on a scooter with another guy. She sent the plates. Send it to the general staff to get the info around with priority surveillance in Sevran. The scooter could lead us to the delivery point. Let's go. Hello? How are you, Bob? Well, I feel like I have a hangover. How's it going with Mr. Handsome from Paris? We're making progress. Anyway, I miss you. You too. You don't sound too good. Are you okay? Sara, it was self-defense. You had to do it. They kicked the shit out of us. They got Viking. - It was your duty as a cop. - I know. Okay, watch your back. Yeah, you too. Bust these assholes and come back to me. Love you, little sister. Take care. Are you okay? We booked a hotel. I'll walk you. Where is he? You really screwed me over, asshole. I'm tired. Take him to the basement. Not you, wait. - What is it? - Come here. You know, all this shit, all this mess, is your fault. Good night. Try to get some sleep. I don't know if I can. Do you want to come up? Come. Wait. Isn't that the scooter HQ is looking for? - This one? - Yes. Check the notice. You're right, that's it. Those motherfuckers are here. What do we do? Go up the street. I'll call it in. Yes? Get the teams. I'll be right there. They've been spotted. In an abandoned building in Aubervilliers. It's the fucking cops! Get in! Be careful! Let's go upstairs! Too late! We're getting there, let's go! - Let's go! - Contact on the right! Contact on the right! Move! Garcia. I cut off his ears and his tongue, but you can still have fun with his balls. Sara. Don't. Don't do this. No. Don't do it. I will. He was hiding in the basement. Are you okay? Leïla and I are from a village called Ben Taïeb, near Nador in Morocco. Our families own most of the land. With the best weed in the Rif. Our families fought over it for years. One day, our parents decided to unite. To expand. With their network and by starting to deal coke too. To seal the union, Leïla and I would get married. I was already living in France. I was in med school. I had to keep the network alive by recruiting. That's how I got my cousin Saïd in the group. He introduced me to Rehlinger. One day, my father called me. He told me that… Someone in the village had betrayed them. I asked who it was. He said, "Tarik Ben Hamid." Young Ali's father. I asked if he was sure. He said yes. He said a taxi driver had seen Tarik Ben Hamid talking to a cop in front of the French embassy in Morocco. He said that when a man betrays you, you kill him and his family. He said that Leïla would help me do the job. This revenge on the Ben Hamid family would be... the foundation of our marriage and of the union of both families. Okay. You had to kill Ali. Why kill Jérôme? He was going to get treatment that day. But his nurse had to deal with another patient. Leïla was really high. She panicked. She stabbed Jérôme. I took care of Ali. Like my father asked. Tell me about Mrs. Ben Hamid. I found her address in Ali's medical file. So we paid her a visit. We said our families wanted to help with her son's surgery. We laced some pastries. We left. We had tea. She ate the pastries. I killed her during the night. I put her in the van you found burnt in the neighborhood. I… I slit her throat. We dumped her in the Seine. Nice plan. When I listen and look at you, I get no impression that you're stupid. Why'd you do it? You have to respect traditions. As my father's only heir, I had to honor him. The Moroccan police called us to tell us they found Tarik Ben Hamid's body. Ali's father. Tortured, beaten to death in a sheepfold in the Toubkal mountain. The so-called traitor. He had just gone to the French embassy to get information on how to get his son hospitalized quicker, given the seriousness of his condition. A witness had walked past. He saw him talking to the cops. Wrong time, wrong witness. All of this for that. IN MEMORY OF JEAN-PAUL BELMONDO… Creative Supervisor Alain Martinossi
