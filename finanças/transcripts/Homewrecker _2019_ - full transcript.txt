Keep going! You can do anything for 30 seconds. Are you in or are you in? Come on people, I need more! Are you in or are you in? In! Yeah you are! That's what I'm lookin' for. This right here. Three, two, one. Bring it back, don't place it down. Put it back to your left. Okay. - One, hit, two and three, slide, four. Travel, five, six, point, seven and eight. Nice. So guys, when you're pointing seven you don't need to do this whole arm prep. Seven, throw, eight. Good. So that head only moves on eight when you jump. Awesome guys, getting a lot better. Okay, still no questions? We're good. Oh... Shit. Does anyone have a tampon? - I wear a DivaCup. - I usually do too, I just wasn't expecting it. Sorry, that ship sailed for me. - I'm sorry? - I'm too old to get my period anymore. - Oh, I didn't mean anything by that. - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Let me check my bag. I might have something kicking around. - Thanks. Oh, thank you. - Good catch. Thanks. - Hey! Fancy meeting you here. Hello. - I've seen you everywhere and I still don't know your name. I'm Linda. - Oh, Michelle. Nice to officially meet you. - Likewise. I love this place. They have the greatest matcha lattes. - I know, right? It's one of my favorite spots. - You know what? I'm gonna grab one and join you. Do you want anything else? - Oh, no that's really okay. I'm actually in the middle of... Fuck. - I love Cindy's class. I've seen you somewhere else. - Moksha Yoga. - Right. I thought you looked familiar. Hm. I love this place. - Yeah, yeah it's a great place to get work done. It's really quiet. - What are you working on? What do you do? - Oh, I'm an interior designer. - Fancy, I love furniture. - Yeah, it's pretty great. - You can make a living doing that? - So far, yeah. People seem to like my taste. - You must be talented. Oh. - Oo, I love that couch. - Yeah, I like that, too. - Is that your boyfriend? - Husband. - Wow. - Yeah. - You're married? - Mm hm. - Oh, you seem too young to be married but I guess not. Oh. Well, it's been a year. - Oh. - Yeah. - How's it goin'? - Pretty good so far. We're tryin' to start a family. - Oh. - Yeah. - That could be hard. - Yeah, yeah, it can be. - What? - Oh, nothing. - You were gonna say something. - No, well, I mean, I don't know. We're just, we're at that phase now where we're trying to have a baby and-- - Yeah. - It's, yeah. - And? - And, you know, it's just a big, it's a big step. - Yeah. - You're not sure you're ready? Or he's not sure? - It's just a, it's just a big decision. I, God, I do not know why I'm telling you this but it's, it's a big step and I just, I don't know, I feel a little resistance or something. I don't know. - Yeah. - I don't know. - No, that's, that's, I get it, right? I get it. - Yeah. - I mean, marriage is a big commitment but you can still leave. But once a kid enters the picture, that's the point of no return, right? - It's true. - Yeah. You have to be careful. - I think I'm just being paranoid. - Well, that could be a good thing. You have to be sure. - Yeah. - You know what I think? - What? - I think you should decorate my house. I should? - Mm hm. What's your rate? I will pay you double. - Oh no, no, that's okay. - Triple. - Oh, well that's some very-- - Quadruple. No, I'm not. I'm joking, I can't. - That's very generous, yeah. - Oh come on. - Well, I gotta think about it. I am working on this project right now and-- - Well, you could come by right now and take a look. I live really close. Right? Please? - I really do have work to do. - Oh my gosh, I need you and my house, it looks like I just moved in and I've been there for years. It'll be fun. - I... - It'll be a great excuse to procrastinate on this work that you don't wanna do. - That's true. Okay, why not? - Yay! - Okay, yay. - Oh goodie. Mm, let's go. - Okay. - It's just down here. - Okay. - Aw, cute baby. - Thanks. - Cunt. - What? Oh, I'm just kidding. - Oh. - So do you live close by? - Yeah I actually live only 10 minutes away. - Oh, cool. - Yeah. - Take a picture it'll last longer! God, I hate when men gawk. - Yeah. - Oh, I'm right over here. - Okay. Oh, I thought you said you live close by? - Oh, I do, I just hate walking. I'm lazy. Oh, okay. I love this neighborhood. - Me too. So why do you think your husband doesn't wanna have a baby? - Oh, I mean I didn't say that. I'm just not sure. - Have you talked to him about it? - No. I'm not good at broaching uncomfortable subjects. I guess I'm always worried that I'm gonna create a problem where this isn't one, you know? What about you? Are you married? - No. No, I'm seeing someone but it's nothing serious. I used to get so hung up on guys like ah! Like why isn't he calling me and. And now I just refuse to let a man dictate my happiness. I'm over it. - I envy that. I always care so much about what other people think. - Oo, you should talk to the vegetables. - Huh? - I had this therapist once who told me that I cared too much what other people thought of me. So, she said I should go to the grocery store and just start talkin' to the vegetables. You know, like oh, hello cantaloupe. You look very handsome today like use an accent of whatever. - And did that work for you? - Not really. She was a shitty therapist. Oh, really? - Oh my God, yeah. It turns out she wasn't even licensed. She was like some new age-y bullshit. - Whoa. - Like, yeah. - Honestly I'm probably just creating drama. Oh man, I love drama. Oh! - Hey, I want you to have this. - Oh, why? - This stupid little hammer helped me through the hardest years of my life and now I want you to have it to help you hammer through your shit. - Oh, well thank you. I can't, I can't accept that though. It clearly means a lot to you. - No, I don't need it anymore. Here, catch. - Oh, okay. - Ta da! - Oh, wow. You have a lot of magazines. - Yeah, I like to do collages. So, can you see yourself spending a lot of time here? - Well, I gotta finish this other project first but I'll see where I'm at. - I just need some help getting organized. Let me give you a tour. - Should I take off my shoes? - Oh don't bother. My place is dirty. Okay. - This is the living room. This is where I watch my stories. The couch is small but it's big enough just for me. I love this fireplace. It doesn't work but I think it's cozy. - Oh, I didn't even ask if you have kids. Is that your son? - No but I painted it. - Oh, cool, you paint. - Yeah. These are my horses. I love my horses. They're my spirit animal. - Did you make that too? - No, I only made some of them. Okay, so this is the dining room. I call this the power room because I'm in a power struggle with my neighbors. I don't wanna get curtains, they don't wanna get curtains. It's a standoff. See? I bought that to remind me of the person I used to be and to see how far I've come. That's why I could give you the little hammer. The symbol lives with me. I'm hoping to build the design around that piece. Do you think that's possible? - Yeah, totally. - Oh, I'm so glad! Okay, let's go into the kitchen. Right this way. This is the kitchen. Nothing too fancy. Have a seat. Oh, cool magnets. - Thank you. They keep me motivated. Let's have a drink. - Water's good for me. - No, something more festive. What do I have? I make the best Cape Cod's. I make them with tequila. - I'm actually okay. - Oh, it'll be fun. I used to be a bartender. Come on, you know you want one. - Maybe just a small one. - Great. - Can I use your bathroom? - Oh, sure. It's right down the steps. - Fuck. Fuck. How do I get out of this? Oh, fun. - See? I told you. I'm fun. Cheers. - Cheers. Oh, these are beautiful glasses. - Thank you. They're a family heirloom. - Oh. - Cheers. I wanna cheer you up. You seem sad. Oh , I'm really okay but thank you. That's really sweet of you. Look at the straw. - Let's see, liquid therapy. Aw, that's good. - You don't have to put on a brave face for me. - Aw, no. I'm really, I'm really okay. So, when would you wanna get this process started? - I know, right? I've been trying to get this place put together for years. What about you? Your place must be amazing. - Yeah, I mean, you know, it's pretty nice. - So do you do most of the decorating or does your husband help? How does that work? - I mean, it's more my wheelhouse you know? He's not very good at it to be honest. Aw, are these your grandparents? - No. Cheers. - Oh. Cheers. You know, I really shouldn't drink before noon. It's not really, I don't really do this. - Come on, that's not fair if I get tipsy and you don't. Don't be such a bummer. - Okay. Okay. Why not? I just, I'm sorry. I really have to go. I've been here so long already. - Come on, I just want you to have a sip. Just a sip. I want you to try it. Go ahead, here, have a sip. - No! Whoa! I'm so sorry. - That glass has been in my family for generations. It was a reflex. - I just wanted you to have a sip. - Listen, I feel really terrible. How can I make that up to you? - We could watch a movie. - What? - I love watching movies in the afternoon. It's like playing hooky. - I, I'm sorry but I really have to go. - I get it. Why would you wanna hang out with a weirdo like me? - What? You're not a weirdo. - Then stay. We could watch a movie and talk about relationships and boys, gossip. It'll be fun. Please. - Okay. Yeah. - Goodie. - That's good. Okay, come back to me now. I'm just gonna spin you out and I want you to come back to me all right? Out and back. Come back to me. You always gonna wear that uniform? - I've got news for you, I had to sneak out of choir practice to get here all right? It wasn't easy and it wasn't fun. Excuse me? Do either of you - You're not one - have change for a 20? - of those people who constantly checks their phone during a movie are you? Gosh, I don't have anything smaller than a 50. - No, no, it can wait. Leila, have fun. It was a waste of time all right? Let's get back to work. - You almost dropped me in the lift, you distracted me during my solo. Daddy-- - Why don't you shut up? - Woo hoo! - Wow. That movie gets better every time I watch it. - It was my first time seeing it. - Shut up. Oh my God, I had no idea. What did you think? - It was cool, it was very 80s, you know? I liked it. - A lot of people don't realize it was Shannen Doherty's first movie. - Oh, really? - Yeah. So wait, wait, wait. We need a debrief. Okay, so what do you think the message of the film was? - Follow your dreams. - Right? You've gotta follow your dreams. I really believe that. - Yeah. - No matter what shit life throws at you, you have to keep following your dreams no matter what. Don't forget that. - I won't, I won't forget that. I promise. - What is it with your generation and checking your phone? - I'm sorry I am expecting a text from somebody. - You can't go two seconds without checking it. - Well, I use this for work. I have to-- - It's compulsive. - Oh my God, I am so sorry. - Uh, that's fine. That's fine, don't worry about it. My contract was up anyway. I just, I should get going. - No, I need to find a way to make this better. I think I have an old phone upstairs. - You know what? It's okay. Don't worry about it. - Oh come on. It's not like it's a family heirloom, let me find you another phone. These things happen. It's really fine. - Will you just wait, please? I'll get you another phone. I'm sorry, it was an accident-- - Linda, it's okay. I'm not mad. I just need to go now. I feel like you are mad. - I promise I'm not. - Then let's have some tea. Another time. - We could talk about boys. Get off of me. - Please, stay! - Seriously? Get off! - Hello? Linda? - Hey. Hey. - What happened? - You fainted. Maybe you are pregnant. - Why did you lock me in here? - Well, things got off to a rocky start and I wanted you to rest undisturbed. - I don't feel right. - Well, you hit your head pretty hard. - When did I faint? - Put a pin in that. I'll be right back. - No, wait, Linda, no. No wait. Oh, fuck. - Hey. Let's just take it to the mat. - You know what? It's really okay. There's no hard feelings. I forgive you. I'm just gonna go. - Oh, I can't let you leave if you're angry at me. - I'm not angry, really. I'm just gonna leave. - I'm gonna heat up some homemade kombucha. It's my cure all for everything. - No, no I don't wanna drink anything. - What? Why not? - 'Cause I don't trust you and I just wanna leave. - What? - I'm sorry, that came out wrong. I just think you might need some help. What? - Or sorry. - What do you mean? - Sorry. I mean-- - Say it. - I think you're having some kind of break down. - What? - I don't, I'm sorry, I just, I just woke up and I don't know what's going on and you're kinda scaring me so-- - I'm scaring you? - I don't think you're doing it on purpose. I think you're just really lonely. I came became because I felt bad for you. I don't know why I'm telling you all of this. I'm sorry. - I thought you liked the movie. - I did. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. - It's okay. I'll be right back. - No, no, Linda. No, Linda, fuck, no. Linda! Linda, just open the door, okay? Linda? I know you're there I didn't hear you walk away. Listen, just, let's just talk about this. We're friends remember? Linda? Linda open the fucking door! What? - Linda? I didn't faint did I? How did I hit my head, Linda? Did you push me? - It was an accident. You wanted to leave me. I didn't mean to hurt you. - I believe that's true. Why don't you just open the door and we can just talk about it? - Hm, I don't know. Are you gonna try to leave again? - Yes. I knew it. - Linda, I feel weird. Did you give me something? - Maybe. - Why did you do that? It's not gonna hurt you. It's not poison or anything. It's just gonna make it so you can't lie to me. - Why did you drug me, Linda? - Because nobody ever tells me the truth. I think all that you need is someone to talk to. So why don't you just open the door and we'll talk, okay? - We can talk like this. - But it'll be so much better if we're face to face, right? - I guess. - When was the last time you had a really good conversation with someone? I think that what you really need right now is a friend. So, just open the door and we'll talk like good friends. - Are you gonna try to leave? - Yes. - I knew it. - I have to leave at some point, right? - Michelle? Michelle? Michelle, you can't get out. I've got this place secured against any potential intruders or rapists. Michelle? Michelle, are you hiding? Michelle? Michelle? You don't need to hide. We can just talk about it. God, remember talking? No one talks anymore. Everyone is so fucking fake. You're just like everyone else. Everyone just says what you wanna hear. Everything is just text, text, text. I have had it Michelle. I have really had it. I used to be popular. I mean I had friends. In high school I was fucking popular. Everyone wanted to be me. I was pretty enough to be a fucking model! Michelle? Now I can't even get people to call me back! Michelle? I am so sick of all these fake friends. Michelle, I just, I just wanna have a girl's day, you know? Do our nails, have facials. I just wanna talk about boys! - Hey Linda, what you up to? - Just practicing some self defense. A lady's gotta stay safe. - Who's there with ya? - A friend. Micky. - Hey Micky. I wouldn't wanna run into you two in a dark alley. Well, happy practice. Thanks. Bye. - Why are you doing this to me? Why did you drug me? What do you want me to tell you? - What is it that you have that I don't? - I don't know, sanity? - What did you say? Michelle, what the fuck do you think you're doing? Michelle? Come on, don't be such a little pussy. Why don't you just come out and we can have a conversation like two grownups? Michelle? Michelle, do you see any weapons in there? No. - I know. Why don't we play a board game? - You're fucking crazy. - Well, I guess you better get comfortable in there. - If I play your board game will you let me go? - Maybe if you win. - Do you promise? - Well what do I get if I win? - What do you want exactly? - If I win you have to make a prank phone call. No, you couldn't even tell a lie if you wanted. If I win you have to do a dirty double dare. - Oh God. Fine, okay. I'm gonna open the door. - I loved playing boardgames when I was a kid. I kept them all. This one is my absolute favorite. It's called Party Hunks. Now, the object of the game in Party Hunks is to get to the party with as many hunks as possible without your dad calling you a slut. I'm kidding about that part but not really. There is a dad character and he can send you to your room or even worse ground you and then you'll never get to the party. Okay, who do you wanna be? I get to be Kimberly. She's the blond. - Is that my wedding ring? - What? No. Maybe. No. Okay, and then there's Brandy. She's the fun redhead. Or Sloane, the stuck up brunette. And there's also Sam. She's got short hair and is a tomboy and everyone calls her the lesbian. No one wants to ever be her. - I'll be Sam. - You're no fun. Okay, and then there's the hunks. Here are the hunks. Dylan, he's a jock. And Michael, he's a poet. He's really sensitive. Oh, there's also Chad but he's off limits. He's mine. - Is that a rule? - No it's just how I play the game. - Okay. - Ew, you picked a dork. Let me finish. Okay, this is Nigel. He's good at math and wears glasses, and then there's Abraham, he's religious. And there's Billy Ray. He's from the wrong side of the tracks. His family is poor. So, you start the game off with 50 kisses and the object of the game is to get to the party with the most amount of kisses so you don't end up with a loser at the party. Okay, I'll let you go first. Oo, you got a babysitting square. Okay, babysitting squares are good because the dad has to drive you home and you get 30 kisses. - Okay my turn. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. Oh, I landed on a ride square. It's not as good as a babysitting square but I can trade kisses to hitchhike to the mall. - I got a video clue. What does that mean? - Oo, you're gonna love the video clue. - Oh, hi sweetheart. How's it goin'? Good. - That sounds wonderful. Say, do you have any big plans for tonight? We're gonna go to the party. - Well, you better get your chores done. I mean you know how your father gets. - So, do you wanna talk about boys? - Sure, if you want to. - Why don't you tell me about the guy you're seeing. - I'm seeing a man but he's also seeing some other nobody. - You're in an open relationship? - Yeah, not by choice. - Well, shouldn't you be with someone who only wants to be with you? - That's not very nice. - Well, it's the truth. - I guess. Your turn. - Okay. - Oo, you get to pick a hunk. Pick a hunk. No, that's Chad, that's mine. Pick another. Oo Dylan! You get to go to the party. Put him in the party. Woo hoo. - Woo hoo. So you were saying earlier that you think your marriage is falling apart? - I didn't say that. - But you said you were worried your husband doesn't wanna have a baby. - I don't wanna talk about this. - Oh, come on. You said you would talk about boys. - This is my marriage, not boys. - Same diff. So, you were saying that he's keeping secrets from you, he's feeling distant? - I never said that. - But you feel it, right? Is this something that just started or have you felt this all along? Mm, all along. Last week he went to see somebody and I don't know who it was and I don't know why it bothers me so much. - But it made you nervous? - Well, I don't know. I don't know if he's drinking or... I just, if he's going through something I just wish he would talk to me about it. - I don't know. If it was me I think it would be hard for me to tell someone I don't wanna have a baby with 'em. - Do you really think that's it? - Maybe and maybe he smells your fear and is starting to doubt you. Or maybe he just doesn't wanna have a kid with you. But I guess you already knew that, right? - Maybe, I don't know. - Isn't it nice to just have an honest conversation? I feel like everyone is always putting on this front. - This isn't honest. You have a clear advantage over me. - Oh, don't worry about me. I'm an open book. Your turn. Oh no, you got a pimple. - Does that mean I have to go back to my room? - No, but if you get two more pimple cards you officially have acne and that's gonna cost you a lotta kisses. I mean, you might end up with a loser or even worse an STD. Those can't really be the rules. - I might've made up a few. - So do you love this guy? - Yeah, no, I don't know, maybe. - Well, how do you do it? How do you stay strong knowing he's with somebody else? - I have my ways. - Well, what are they? - The trick is is to never let them under your skin. You always have to have the upper hand. It's a game, you see? It's about who's in control, who's in charge and who's not. - That doesn't sound like love to me. - Oh, I'm a romantic that's for sure. I mean, that's why I have to be good at the game. My heart always gets me in trouble. - Yeah, I can relate to that. - You ever stop to think why he's pulling away? - How do you mean? - Well, maybe he's just not right for you. I mean, maybe you're too young for him. You could be missing out on your soulmate because you're settling for someone who's just not a match. - Yeah. - Two, three, four, five. - I'm so psyched for this party tonight. - You can say that again. - Hey babes, you're all stone cold foxes. - Will you be at the party? - Yeah. See you there. - I do have those thoughts. - You have? - Constantly like rapid fire. And what good are they? They just keep me from being present. It's like my insecurity gets in the way. - You are insecure. - I mean it's just in my head and I make it a reality. He's not a mind reader. I'm just too scared to talk to him, to show him who I really am, how much I love him. Of course we're right for each other. I mean, if he didn't wanna be with me then he wouldn't be with me. - Are you thinking about leaving now? Good. Boys are a head fucked species. - What do you mean by that? - It's all a bunch of build me up buttercup bullshit and then they just let you down, you know? I just want someone to be real with me, tell me where I stand, just be straight with me. Instead it's just like they just say what they think I wanna hear so they can eat their cake and eat it too. It's crazy making. - What is? - Sex. It complicates everything. - Sometimes. - I mean, you can't just tell me you don't love me anymore and then fuck me like it's a religion. That's not fair. - No, it's not. - Right? - I'm sorry that happened to you. - It's okay. - No, it's not okay. No one should play with someone's emotions like that. It's cruel. - It really hurt. - Yeah. - Linda? - Yeah? - Are you gonna let me go? - I don't think so. - Fuckin' get over my dead body. - Hey, hey! Hey! Fuck! Fine, make yourself comfortable. I'm sorry you had to find out this way. I guess you're pretty mad at me, huh? - So, what is this? Are you tellin' me to stay away from your man? - I hadn't really planned this far ahead. I kinda just wanted to hang out with you. - And now you're gonna kill me or something? - No, I never planned on killing you. But why did you have to be such a fucking bitch? - I'm a bitch? You fucking drugged me. - That's because you're all a bunch of liars, all of you. It's just me, me, me. Snapchat, Instagram Story, oo selfie, selfie, me. Never text me back, well fuck you too. - I see. - What do you see? - Robert never slept with you. You're just some sad delusional woman who's obsessed with a man she can never have. - Wrong. We fucked right here just last week when you were having drinks with Kelly. - Well congratulations, you're a great stalker. - He has a birthmark on his ass that looks like Sisley, he's allergic to cashews and he told me you never go down on him because of your TMJ. - Well there's no way he likes you. - Excuse me? - Robert would never give himself to some whacked out fucking nut job like you. - Oh man. You would cry if you knew what I knew. - I know that you are just some fucking lonely pathetic crazy psycho cunt and I doubt very much that anyone loves your tragic ass! - Well I know I'm gonna break your God damn neck. - I'd like to see you fucking try you fucked up slut! - No! Get off me! This is where all the magic went down. - Get the fuck off me! - "Oh Linda, I love you so much. "You're the only one for me, Linda." Ow! You're gonna love this. These are our love cuffs. No, no! - I drew you a bath you dirty little bitch. - You're gonna kill me just 'cause you're too old to have a baby. - You don't know anything about me. - I know you're fucking done, Linda. It only gets worse for you from here. It doesn't matter what you do to me. Your life is over. - I have your husband you dumb bitch! - He doesn't give a shit about you and you know it. - I liked it better when you were an insecure little mouse! - After everything you've done to me, I still feel sorry for you. Even if you kill me. That's not gonna change the fact that you're just an unlovable fuck up. Deal with that shit. - You know, you have a pretty smart tongue for a little lady. It'll look great on my mantle! Bobby! Bobby! - Hey, Linda. - Oh, you got me flowers. Yeah. - Come in. Actually, oh. They smell so good. - Yeah, he look I don't want you to get the wrong idea. - What do you mean? - Well, it's just that I wanted to get those for you to just say thank you for being such an important part of my life and I wanted to say that-- - Oh, Bobby. You are such an important part of my life. - No, Linda look, you gotta let me finish, okay? What I wanted to say. Is there somebody upstairs? - No, I just have the TV on. It's shark week. Okay. - Do you wanna go into the kitchen? - Oh, actually I can't stay. I wanted to come by and say goodbye. - Oh, you mean like last week. Fuck, that was hot. - Yeah, look, please Linda let's not do this, okay? - What do you mean? - Bobby don't fight this. You know we're meant to be together. You know-- - No, look Linda, Linda, I gotta say last week was a mistake, okay? - My favorite mistake. - Okay, look Linda. I'm married. - Yeah and you hate her. - No, I don't. - You told me. - When? When did I ever say I hated my wife? - You told me you didn't wanna have a baby. - No, I didn't. I never said that. When did I say any of this? - You've been saying that for years. - Well, that's exactly my point. How the fuck was I supposed to know? I was a kid. - You said she wasn't the one. - Well, she is the one and I am in love with her and I am sorry if that hurts you, okay? Look, please Linda, look we had something, okay? But that was a long time ago. I was young and you were... It's just, it's time that we end this. - Kiss me or I will tell her everything. - No, it is too late for that. - No, it's not. - Yes, look calm down. - What is she gonna want a two bit chippy liar like you? - Hey, look I am done blaming you for all my mistake, okay? And I am done with lying, okay? So I'm gonna find Michelle and come clean with her. - Oh, right. You don't have the balls. She would never forgive you. - Yeah? Well, you're probably right, okay? But that still doesn't change the fact that what we have is done, okay? - No, uh uh. - No, why would you want someone like me, okay? This is not healthy. - Because I love you. Not it's not. It's everything. - Look, no, Linda please. - Please don't leave me, please. - Stop. - Please don't go. - Okay, Linda please. - I love you so much. - Enough, no. - Don't go, I love you. Please. - Look... - No, no! - Don't cry, okay? Please. - No. No. - Yes. I'm so sorry, okay? - What the hell is going on up there? - It's all her fault! Everything was fine until she ruined it! - No everything was not fine. - Why? Just because I can't have your baby? - Jesus, look, goodbye Linda, okay? - You don't love me. - What? - You never loved me. - That is not true, okay? You were a very important piece of my life. - What a crock of shit! - Okay, well what about you? - What about me? - You think you really loved me? - Yes, of course I loved you. It's the only thing I know! Really? - Yes! - Then why can't you just be happy for me? Why can't you just let me move on? Why do you have to control my whole life? - Because you don't know any better. - Well, I do now and I'm leaving. - You are such a liar. - Yeah, you're right I am and I'm done lying. - You told me you'd love me 'til the day you died. - Okay, Linda I can't do this anymore. - You're still alive! - Okay, calm down! What's going, ow! Ow! What are you doing? Stop, please! Oh, fuck. Oh. Say something.
