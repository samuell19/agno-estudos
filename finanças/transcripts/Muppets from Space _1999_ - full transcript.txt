The goat? The remote. The remote. I thought he said, "The goat. " Over the past few months, we have received some unusual communications. Communications, sir, that are not of this Earth. Really? RENTRO: Incoming. Ooh. Sorry about that, general. Here's your remote. Thank you, Rentro. We believe that aliens are using a contact on Earth to plan their invasion. Now, this same message, "R U there," has appeared all over the world. We've been lucky enough to capture these instances on film. The pyramid at Giza. Stonehenge. Okay, now this one says, "R U three," but we believe that to be a simple spelling error. This could be vandalism, a practical joke. Now, you see that? Ha-ha-ha. That's what I said, general. These photos are, uh... Um... I'll just be over here then. Ahem. Right this way, general. When I plotted these anomalies sequentially, a pattern emerged. [BLEEPING] A spiral. Do you see the spiral? Sir, they are out there. They are coming here. Do you have any idea what you have here, Singer? Sir, I have an inkling. Bubkes. Bubkes? Good day. But, sir, we have to take action now. I hired you to find me an alien. And you bring me doctored photos and a spiral. You are on thin ice, boy. I gotta hand it to you, sir. I thought your presentation was just wonderful.

BOTH: No, no, no. We're not the same as you. We are highly evolved beings. Now, if... What was I saying? My people? Oh, yes. Excellent. You must mow the lawn if you wish to find what you seek. I should mow the lawn? Mm. A lawn that is cut in your own words, Gonzo. A message that can be seen from space. Space! So trim it well. Goodbye, Gonzo. And may the fish be with you.

But I have to respond. Gotta make contact. Ah. Where's he going with those keys? Who cares? Flying saucer, maybe. Dos deuces. Huh? The prawn cracker wins. Pair of twos! I swear I had four aces.

We gotta tell him the truth, Pepe. You tell him and I will smack you. I will smack you like a bad, bad donkey, okay. Sal. Yeah, Johnny. There are no cannolis here. Yeah, but try this cake. This is a beauty. That is nice. Would you...? Gonzo, Gonzo! GONZO: Go easy on the buffet, fellas. I just want... Who cut the cake? Who cut the cake? Who cut it? What? Oh, look at that.

"I'm sure you've often wondered what might those alien creatures look like?" [GONZO PANTING] People of Earth, do not be alarmed. My message will be brief. I am Gonzo. Gonzo? Hmm? Uh... Piggy? I don't have a Gonzo. Ha-ha-ha. There seems to be some mistake. Ha-ha-ha. Dang. You better get down there, Kerm. Relax. No one is going anywhere, okay? You see, I was contacted through my breakfast cereal, and it was confirmed to me by the cosmic fish, that I am definitely from outer space. So you wanna go now or wait for the commercial? Now. Come on. What are you doing here? Huh? I'm making contact. What are you doing? Um... Interview him. I'm interviewing... I'm interviewing you! GONZO: Great! What would you like to know?

Excellent. This seemingly ordinary rubber ducky actually contains invisibility spray. However, the effect is, sadly, temporary. The old rubber-ducky-with- invisibility-spray trick. Check. And, Beaker, if you would. Here is something that we're very excited about. BEAKER: Mee-mee! "Door in a jar"? Mee-mee-mee! Mee-mee! That's absolutely right, Beakie. All you do is open up the jar, fling the contents onto the wall, and poof! Poof! Instant door. Wow. What is this? A secret communication device? No. That's Scotch tape. Useful if something tears. Ah. PIGGY: Ahem. ALL: Ooh. And what do you have for moi? Ah. Ooh. Well, Miss Piggy, for you we have Muppet Labs Mind Mist. Simply spray it on the subject, and they will obey your every command. [LAUGHS] I dou... Ooh-ho! Mee-mee-moo-hoo. [GRUNTS] I doubt I'll need any. Okay, guys. Let's go get Gonzo. RIZZO: Yeah. Come on. PEPE: We'll find him, okay. Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo! Yeah!

[GULPS] [♪♪♪] I hope I'm not imposing, but I thought you were just great on TV. Could I get your autograph? Rentro? Yes, sir? It's not a good time. This is probably not a good time. Yeah. Ahem. Forgive me my earthly manners. But do you have any idea what it's like [CHUCKLES] to be laughed at? Yeah. Sure I do. To be called names like "wacko"? Uh-huh. And "freak boy"? Oh, yeah. And "paranoid delusional psychopath"? Got me there. To feel completely alone in this world? Yeah. I think we're starting to get the general idea there, Ed. Yeah.

That's the Birdman. Where are you? Gladys? He don't bother nobody. Been here forever. [GRUNTING] Gladys! Come on, the guys are watching. He just likes to hang out with his birds. Know what I mean? So that about does it for all of us here at Medical Research. [GRUNTING] Medical Research? Yeah. But that would mean we're lab rats! RIZZO: Gonzo, get me out of here! SINGER: Now, Mr. Gonzo. Hm? What can you tell me about these? Whoa. They really have been looking for me. SINGER: And they are coming to Earth? GONZO: I don't know. SINGER: How many are there? GONZO: I don't know. When will they be here? And don't you dare tell me that you don't know. Uh... I know not? [GRUNTS] But maybe I could find out? Could you? Okay. Well... Okay, then. I'll keep in touch. Thanks. Oh. Heh. So back to the limo? It's a shame, really. Huh? I really need that information. So I'm afraid we'll have to perform an invasive quadra-lobal brain probe on you and pluck it from your head.

[♪♪♪] Hey, Fozzie, tell me again. Why are we doing this? To save Gonzo. Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo! Right. Because Gonzo's one of us. No matter what happens, no matter what obstacles we face, we never forget one of our own. PIGGY: I love it when you take charge. Hey! We left Bunsen and Beaker back at the gas station. Okay. Well, uh... From now on, no matter what happens, we never forget one of our own. That's right. Hmm. Cheese Twiddle? Is this movie time or something? Oh, no. So you're the new guy. From this moment on, if I say you're hungry, you eat. If I say you're sleepy... I eat? Oh, you shouldn't have... Well, well, well. We got a funny boy here. Is that bad? Very bad. Looks like funny boy's going to the maze. Since we don't want funny boy to get lonely, you'll all do time in the maze. I'm sorry. I didn't know. See, no one's ever escaped from the maze, funny boy. Even if you did, it's four feet to the ground, 12 feet to the door and four feet to the doorknob. That's 18 feet. Twenty. Funny thing about doorknobs: Rats can't turn them. No opposable thumb. [LAUGHING] [THE O'JAYS' "SURVIVAL" PLAYING] [YELLS] This is ridiculous. No, no. Hey, Riz, watch out for them red circles. RIZZO: Yeah? What's wrong with the red...? Aah! Nobody ever listens.
