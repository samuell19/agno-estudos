What you're looking at is downtown Pittsburgh, one million b.C. Those two big guys are fighting for parking space. This is where our story begins. If they could have learned to live together like decent human beings, they'd still be around. There never would have been an energy crisis. But they died out, and what was left of them turned into fossil fuel -- oil. See? It's not cute when 11 tons gets cranky. Their problem was they were all teeth and no brain, which brings US to this guy. Jimmy Carter was president of the United States when everybody started to notice we were running out of dead dinosaurs -- no more gas to run our cars, fights at the pumps, people getting nozzle-whipped. So what was his solution? He made a speech. The energy crisis has not yet overwhelmed US, but it will if we do not act quickly. We didn't. When america finally ran out of gas, an angry mob broke into the white house and lynched him, along with three or four of his snottier cabinet members. Carter's successor, David eisenhower, resigned and moved to a south sea island with his girlfriend Heidi, where they spent all day rolling in the sand pretending they were grunion. America was desperate for a strong leader like Teddy Roosevelt or fdr. With the power invested in me by the supreme court... Instead, they elected a man who had only one thing in common with these great men -- his last name, Roosevelt. Chet Roosevelt -- a cosmically inspired former governor of California. President Roosevelt tried numerous fund-raising schemes to save the country, including win a date with the secretary of agriculture, a national marijuana smoke-off, and a contest to guess how many jelly beans were in the statue of Liberty. All of this failed, but he kept the country afloat by secretly borrowing billions of dollars from america's wealthiest citizen -- Sam birdwater. God knows I am a patriot. I loaned the country $400 billion, and I want my $400 billion back. Does that make me a bad guy? I've got to eat, too, you know. [ Alarm clock buzzing ] So I'm giving the president until the end of September this year to pay me back, or else I'll be forced to foreclose. What can I do? I've got to eat, too, you know. Does that make me a bad guy? By the fall of 1998, we were all used to waking up to bad news. That's me -- Eric mcmerkin. Boy, I was a good-looking guy. Announcer: We're going to have a complete report on kbob at 11:00 tonight. Now the weather -- beautiful beach day. Freeway conditions heavy. This report brought to you by magic seat -- the bicycle seat that fits like a glove and grabs you like a friend. And now, still going strong after 40 years, the beach boys.

Siegelstein of bay shore, New York. Woman: Coffee for the people! Man: More kilowatt-hours! Oust Roosevelt! Man #2: We need some money, Jack! White house tour, please stay with me. Step lively, folks. Out of the way, please. Come on, come on. Get out of here. Filthy beggars, get back. Suck a lemon, will you? All right, folks, please, come on. Come on. He's a yutz! He's a yutz! Unhand me! Get out of here. One thing that's very important -- no pictures when we go inside, okay? One picture -- that's it. Okay, follow me. Here we go. A word about China -- China had become a major world power, defeating Russia in table tennis and a nuclear war. They also had become total capitalists, opening a chain of fast-food restaurants. The big seller was a mao tse tongue on rye. Thank you, Sam. How's it hanging? All right. Everyone, there is a cabinet meeting in session, so please, as quiet as possible. Wipe your feet and don't touch anything. There's a cabinet meeting in session. Yes, isn't it wonderful? Come into the presidential living room, sir. [ All arguing ] Another one of them damn tours right in the middle of our meeting. Sir, would you please put that down? That doesn't belong to you. Keep your hands off. Gentlemen, that is a valuable family heirloom. It is worth a lot of money. Please don't touch it, all right? Did I tell you to wipe your feet? What, you come in with a great Dane? [ Telephone rings ] This raffle idea is ridiculous, and I want you to know that now. Man: I don't care what you think. We've got to do something. Hi, United States of america. No, this is Lucy. Oh, yes, Mr. Ambassador, I'll tell him you called. Oh, you're having a nice time, ma'am? You're having a nice time? Up, please. Sir, no bouncing in the white house, okay? What, any port in a storm with you? Do you understand English? I'm trying -- wait a minute. I told you not to touch anything in the white house. Now will you please leave that alone? Would you leave, please? I'm sorry. I just -- look, everybody, please just come into the next room. I didn't mean to hit you. Don't tell anybody, please. President Roosevelt was a successful graduate of est, scientology, tm, and primal growth therapy, and he was elected on a platform unique in American political history -- &quot;I'm not a schmuck.&quot; even though that was Chet's only campaign promise, it looked like it would be a tough one to keep. 25. [ Chuckles ] Oh. Very good, Mr. President. Very good. Thank you, Jerry. I'd like to acknowledge you for giving me this space for an incredible workout. Do you want me to stop them? No, no, it must be the 2:00 tour. I've got to get to the cabinet meeting. Hello, hello. Nice to see you. Hello, darling. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. Excuse me. I have to go to a cabinet meeting. Hello. Hi, how are you? I love Chinese food. Welcome to the white house. Thank you very, very much. Oh, I see you're all here. That's great. Please! No. Guide: People, let's move it. Please, ma'am, no spitting in the hallway. Hi, babe. Man: $400 billion, and 30 days to come up with it. Couldn't we come up with some kind of loan? And what could we use as collateral? Mr. President, don't you think this situation is getting rather frightening? Mnh-mnh. No, herb, I don't believe in fear. Fear is just a bogeyman of your mind. I believe in taking responsibility. We created this. We can create a way out. We've got to move, sir. You've got to decide. Mr. President -- oops. Excuse me. Christ. Do you want to go down in history as the president who lost his country? What loss, missy? What is, is. Get it? Am I right, Jerry? Jerry? Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry. I was thinking. Huh. I know a way to raise money, and it would be fun, too. What is it, Lucy? Let's hold a dance and charge the entire country $5 a head to get in. Missy: Oh, I can't stand it. Get in where? We don't even own a building. Now, now, hang on. There's no need to put Lucy down. She's just saying what she feels. Mm-hmm. I can't stand this indecision. Now, we have 30 days -- 3-0, 720 hours -- and poof! -- This country is history. Oh, come on. He's such a downer. I heard that. All right, I've made a decision. We go ahead with the raffle. Missy: Now, that makes sense. I can't believe it. You are the president of the United States, and you are going to allow him to go on television and raffle off the tomb of the unknown soldier to the highest bidder? It's a disgrace. You're all a disgrace. I'm sorry, but I am forced to resign. Herb... I'm clear that you need the space to move on. I love you. Leave your name tag at the desk. Bye-bye. Now, where were we? Vince! V-- not you. Vince. Where is vanderhoff? He's never here. Some assistant. He went to pick up the media man -- mcmerkin. Mcmerkin? Yes. You know, the genius -- the media genius. He's going to help US sell this raffle idea. Oh, yeah. [ Straw drains glass ] I had become america's leading media expert, and even though we didn't have enough fuel to run cars, there was one thing Americans refused to do without -- television. Follow me. Excuse me. Can you spare $25 for a cup of coffee? Get away. Mr. Vanderhoff, what's going on? I don't have anything at the present time. Excuse me. Are you with him, sir? He has no comment for you. Mr. Vanderhoff, would you care to comment on the rumor that president Roosevelt has been assassinated? Guys, how am I supposed to know that? I haven't been upstairs yet. Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you very much. Mcmerkin, of course you're going to have to wear an official government I.D. Card. For you. Ah, jerks. Why don't you move back to Washington? Assholes. Hi! Hello. You wait here. Everyone's so uptight today. Hi. They're ready for you. Be positive. Hello. I'm glad you could make it, uh... Eric. Eric. Welcome to the western white house. Jerry -- Jerry, let's dispense with the formalities. I'm president Roosevelt. This is my cabinet and my old lady. Uh, we've met. Please, sit down. Thank you. Eric, we've chosen you because of your distinguished work with the networks and your brilliant research at the university. And because you know this country where it lives -- in front of the TV set. Ah, that's -- that's very nice of you. What did you have on your mind? Nothing. We have nothing on our minds. We're clear. No clutter. I see. Huh. What we do have is a purpose. We want to hold a raffle. A raffle? Mcmerkin, this country is flat broke. Really? Not a pot to piss in, pal. Vince, please, let's move past it, okay? Sir, I hate to disappoint you, but raffles don't work on television. It's strongly been proven through research. Why don't you do a telethon? Telethons always work. Look what they did for disease. I love that idea. Chet, I could sew costumes. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. A telethon. Yeah. Yeah, I like that. All of the people taking responsibility. All of the people contributing. Yeah, I like that -- a telethon. Wait a second. Wait a second. How about -- how about an americathon? Jerry. [ Humming ] Jerry, don't do that. Would you close the curtains, please? Just close the curtains. Our problem is buffalo. Sam birdwater got started on the road to riches by anticipating the popularity of clown shoes, a fad that swept the nation in the late 1980s. He parlayed this windfall by getting into an essential and practical form of transportation -- high-fashion roller skates, skates for every mood. Finally, he formed national Indian knitting enterprises, the largest conglomerate of its kind in the world. Sam: I loaned the country $400 billion, and I want my $400 billion back. Does that make me a bad guy? Is there some place we can speak privately? Anything you can say to me can be said in front of my workers. None of them speaks English. You watch. Fire! See? Nothing. Fine. Mr. Birdwater, I am here to make an offer. What kind of offer? Well, certainly, sir, you must understand that this telethon business can't possibly work. Oh, maybe it can. Come on, Mr. Birdwater, you're a businessman. Do you think they can raise $400 billion in 30 days? It isn't possible. [ Bell rings ] Damn union. Another break. I don't want this country. What the hell am I going to do with it? Oh, sure, I like Idaho, Hawaii's nice, but a place like New York -- I couldn't even give it to the mohawks. And don't get me started on Cleveland. I just want my money. Which is exactly what my associates are prepared to give you. Associates? At the present time, they must remain nameless, but when america defaults to you, we're prepared to take it off your hands. You got cash? Lots of it, babe. I found myself appointed secretary of entertainment. Three hours later, we met to choose a telethon host. We couldn't agree on anybody, and we were down to the bottom of the barrel. The leading candidates included Chuck barris, whose latest hit was entitled &quot;The schlong show,&quot; in which a panel of celebrities would judge and humiliate contestants based on the size of their private parts. Binky fun -- a bit sophomoric, but broad-base appeal. Excuse me, sir. Binky fun is a fictitious name. The man was actually born Jack rosenoff. He opposed the use of whale oil lamps and belongs to several other environmental groups. A real subversive. No government clearance. Peter Marshall -- former game show host, now a respected news anchorman. President Roosevelt, dealing with our nation's financial crises, has sold either &quot;A&quot; -- Yosemite national park, &quot;b&quot; -- The everglades, or &quot;C&quot; -- His mother's priceless China set. He has the trust of the public. He has been highly critical of this administration. I think he'd be bad policy. Well, Vince, now, remember, we have to allow him space for his position. But he's not funny. Yeah, you're right. Pass. Monty rushmore. [ Laughing ] That's that -- that guy. Popular, high appeal. Never regained the movie star fame he had in the '80s, but he has maintained audience awareness as the star of a weekly comedy series, &quot;both father and mother.&quot; well, what do you say, Vince? Totally acceptable to the government. Then he's our man. And now back to &quot;Both mother and father.&quot; woman: Timmy, come on. I'm not kidding now. I'm going to tell your father if you don't stop it. What's going on in there? Woman: Your son's tying me up again. Timmy, you better stop... [ Muffled yelling ] Timmy, how many times do I have to tell you? Don't tie up your babysitter. I have to pay extra for that. [ Muffled yelling ] Timmy: Damn it. Hold still. I'll be right back. [ Muffled scream ] I don't want a babysitter. All the guys make fun of me. I'm the only guy on the squad who has a babysitter. Don't grow up too fast, Timmy. Next thing, you'll want your own bike. I'd rather have a Cadillac. [ Laughter ] But seriously, dad, can't I stay over at a friend's like the other guys do? It means a lot to you, doesn't it, son? Yeah. Oh, okay. Untie Janet and get dressed. I'll drop you off on my way to work. You mean the bars again? Stop that, Timmy. Here I come, Janet. Come on, Timmy... Martha... Our little boy is growing up. Will you take my panties off your head? Underwear is a very personal thing. And you tell your father to pay me in money next time, you little shit. Bye, Janet. [ Laughter ] Hi, dad. Timmy, I love you. He'll be fine. I understand he's a wonderful man. Where are those guys that are waiting for me? Oh, thank you. Thanks for coming. Mr. Rushmore, I am Vincent vanderhoff. This is Eric mcmerkin. Pleased to meet you, sir. Oh, it's an honor to meet you guys. When my agent told me that you were coming here after the show, I almost cried. Me, playing a part in a slice of history. I mean, me, a schmo from the slums. I am so moved. I am so hungry. I'm hungry. Hey, you guys had lunch? I haven't. I haven't. Come on, let's go to the commissary, and we'll grab a sandwich. Listen, I'm going to need a lot of things -- a decorated dressing room, my own makeup man. Uh, let's see, what else do I need? I'll need some diet pills. Oh, yeah, you know, just a mild stimulant. 30 days and nights -- got to keep awake. Hey, they got a re-textured meat substitute here. Tastes just like pastrami. And so, my fellow Americans, my brothers, my sisters, that is why we cannot let our minds get in the way of our purpose. And this telethon is not only an incredible opportunity to save our country, but also an incredible opportunity for all of US to be responsible. It's incredible... Incredible. Incredible. Everything's so goddamn incredible. You know what's really incredible? That this moron is president. You want to know what his I.Q. Really is, huh? 102 -- moron. And I've learned that we're all on this planet together. Our brother countries have opened up their hearts to US... [ Humming and eating an apple ] And are sending US their finest performers. That is why we have allocated every last dollar available to US to make this telethon happen. Engineers have been working round-the-clock to connect a powerful steam generator to run the electrical equipment. And so, starting tomorrow, for 30 days and 30 nights, I hope that you'll all contribute your gold and other valuables to the americathon. I'm Chet Roosevelt, your president, and I love you. [ Apple crunches ] Gentlemen, soon america will be yours. I'd better explain something about these two gentlemen. Israel and their arab neighbors got along better than anyone ever dreamed, and in 1991, moishe weitzman and Abdul Ben vereen Muhammed became leaders of the united hebrab republic, a new nation conceived in aggression, world domination, and having a good time on a Saturday night. They all learned to live together as brothers once they realized the most important thing they had in common -- the hots for anything blonde with a tush. [ Wolf whistle ] [ Wolf whistle ] Meanwhile, I only had 24 hours to get the show on the air. I was cool, calm, and scared shitless. Move the stuff off. It's going to be in the way here. How's everything going? It looks good on paper, but I didn't realize it was going to be so much work. I don't even know how I got roped into this thing. Fine. I've compiled a list of performers who are not on any government blacklist. &quot;willie Lester, ventriloquist. Ventriloquist, ventriloquist, ventriloquist.&quot; something wrong? Nothing, but you've got 27 acts here, and 25 are ventriloquists. Listen, you're working for the government now. Put them on. Put them on. Okay. Okay. I'll put them on. Okay. ♪ Come on, come on ♪ ♪ get a move on ♪ ♪ come on, come on ♪ ♪ get a move on ♪ ♪ I said come on, come on ♪ ♪ get a move on ♪ ♪ won't you come on ♪ ♪ come on ♪ ♪ and get a move on? ♪ ♪ Come on, come on ♪ ♪ get a move on ♪ And now, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first minute of the first day of the first americathon with the greatest array of talent ever assembled all on one stage to help america save itself...

For the next 30 days, nights, and afternoons, we're going to be Americans together, passing the hat for america. I want you to dig deep into your pockets. Don't hurt yourselves, but you know what I mean -- contribute, get out there, participate with US. This is going to be a terrific, important event. We're going to have a great show for you, so send in that money. If you want coffee, there's plenty. Corrina? I want to talk about costumes. Looking good, mcmerkin. Costumes are fine, performers seem happy. They should -- it's the first time most of them have worked in 30 years. Have you seen the guy with the talking armpit? Who are these people? $728387. I'd like to introduce a wonderful act straight from the gambling capital of america -- Miami, Florida. Here they are. A nice big welcome for the carlsons. Do your steps for mommy. My baby's such a big fan of yours. Thank you. It will be wonderful working with you. Great beginning, huh? What do you think? Oh, i-I'm sure it's going to be great. Weren't you watching? Well, I'm trying to coordinate costumes. When I'm out there, I want you watching me. Monty, you're going to be on for 30 days. Then you'll watch me for 30 days. You watch me. Ugh. Look at this act. The worst. Got to get them off. Let's hear it. Come on, let's hear it. Beautiful. Wonderful. The carlsons. He was very good, but the lady with the balls -- outstanding. Now, we want you to call in. That's the important thing. Everyone all across the country was watching the telethon, from what was left of New York to the first all-gay state, north Dakota. All eyes were glued to their sets, which in some cases ruined a lot of good shoes. Everyone hoped that the show would save the country, or at least get them to Tuesday. Many plug-in items were received, but, unfortunately, they were not of great value because there were no more plugs. However, there were many acts of heroism. One young patriot from New Jersey, Chris broder, vowed to cross america on his skateboard. His supportive and patient dad went along for the trip. Will you come on? Come on, Chris, let's go. Come on, you little pansy. Move your ass! Back at the telethon, monty was about to make a trip of his own. Will you look at this guy? You're going to be a movie star again. You are. Just hang in there, cutie. Just hang in there. But you can't do it alone. You have to have your little friends. Where are they? Where are my friends? Where are they? Oh, there they are. Hi, guys. Don't be jealous, pinkies. We're going to go for a whitey. Keep practicing. Great costume. Wait downstairs. Keep practicing. Everyone's going to get on. Excuse me. Miss mouling Jackson has arrived, and we can't find our accommodations. Oh, my god. You're early. Is there some kind of problem? No, no. No problem. I just have to make some dressing room adjustments. [ Speaks Vietnamese ] Oh, man, what's the problem, huh? I mean, the guitars are getting heavy, the guys smell, I'm sweating like a pig. I mean, come on, what's the hassle? No hassle, miss Jackson. Why don't you and your friends use Mr. Rushmore's dressing room, okay? Just for the time being. I ought to tell you something about mouling Jackson's homeland, Vietnam. Vietnam had become the French riviera of the 1990s, and the beautiful people of the world flocked there to enjoy its white sand beaches, luxury hotels, exciting night life, and gambling casinos. Vietnam was also the home of a growing musical phenomenon, puke rock, and mouling Jackson was its biggest star. In her high school graduating class, mouling was voted most likely to take a life. Oh, quaaludes. Cocaine. What the hell is this? Hey, what are you guys doing here? Hey, what -- this is my dressing room. What -- hey, uppers. They suck. [ Speaks Vietnamese ] And now, here's monty! Vince: Hey, this show is terrible. No way. It's looking pretty good to me, vanderhoff. What are you talking about? These are the worst acts I could find, and this guy rushmore will not last three days. The man is on drugs. I handpicked him myself -- a manic depressive with a bad ticker. When my government send me to usc, I watched his films. Years ago. According to my calculations, they're off to an excellent start. Come on. A couple of hundred million dollars. Come on. Watch this guy rushmore. You're going to see a man have a total emotional collapse. Guys, I promise, okay? We've decided to put our men in a state of readiness just in case. Men? How big is this suite? Hebrab: Behind the hotel, a commando squad -- arabs and Jews united in brotherhood. [ Speaking foreign language ] It's only 3:00 in the morning. You're sleeping already.

What do you want? Mr. Rushmore, I think we should have a talk. You'd better believe we have to talk. We all know things aren't going as well as planned. Plan? Oh, sorry. I must have missed that. I didn't know we had a plan. I thought that was just a surprise party out there. There's no need to be hostile. We're not your father. Who's this jerk? President Roosevelt. Oh, I'm -- I'm terribly sorry, sir. I-I didn't recognize you. I don't read the papers. But, sir, maybe you can understand. I fought very hard for my career. I've hurt a lot of people. I've destroyed three marriages. Got it. I can't let that all go to nothing because this jerk is bringing in ventriloquists and marching bands. Don't you understand? Now, how far behind are we? Not very. How far behind? $70 billion. What? $70 billion. 7-0 billion? Oh, well, $70 billion. We've been out there seven days and we're only $70 billion behind. I'm going to kill -- monty, monty, monty. Relax. But -- relax. But we've got to do something. Monty, I agree. The problem is the acts. The entertainers are not the problem. They're all government-approved. The acts will make a difference. We've got to create spectaculars -- something people can't see every day. I like that. The unusual, the uncommon. What do people really want? Well, cigarettes. Blenders. Credit cards. Well, I find that people enjoy a good ventriloquist act. Cars that run. Cars. What are you going to show, a car? That's going to make people angry. They don't own one. They'll attack US. What if someone attacks the car? Ladies and gentlemen, the ultimate battle. America's last car versus america's greatest daredevil -- Oklahoma Roy budnitz! [ Tires screech ] Yaah! [ Tires skidding ] Aah! Ladies and gentlemen, Oklahoma Roy budnitz has destroyed america's last car! Let's hear it for Oklahoma Roy budnitz! Ladies and gentlemen, I've got to tell you, god bless you people. The money is rolling in, it's pouring in. Oh, isn't it exciting, Vince? All the phones are lighting up. Yes, sir. I'm delighted, sir. Incredible. It's working. Incredible, sir. [ Sarcastically ] Incredible, incredible, incredible. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry, get over here. Huh? Come here. Come here. Jerry, Jerry, come here. Listen, did you set up that date with mouling? Who? The Vietnamese girl. Oh, I thought she was Chinese. Vietnamese. Oh, yes. She'll be at the condo in one hour. Oh, boy, that's terrific. She's got such a terrific body. I bet she's so hot! Lucy. I was just asking Jerry where you were. I'm right here. Honey, would you do me a huge favor? I have some very important business to handle at the apartment, and Jerry was saying that, uh, it would be a great help to US if -- if you stayed here at the telethon, okay? Jerry said that? Yeah, he was saying that, weren't you, Jerry? Yeah, he was just saying that. Okay, honey, have fun, and I'll come back for you later, okay? Let's move. Monty: What is it? We got our first state to reach its quota of $1,000 per person. It's our 57th state -- england! British announcer: Cheery hello from the state capital of London. There have been changes, many changes since england was annexed by her former colonies. Today is a day of celebration -- from the limeyland amusement park on the former grounds of Buckingham Palace to here, outside thatch's disco at 10 downing street. ♪ Can't you take another chance ♪ ♪ that they will not impress me ♪ ♪ attach me to your credit card ♪ ♪ then you can undress me ♪ ♪ everybody is on their knees ♪ ♪ except the Russian savage that I need ♪ ♪ got it better, I've gone too far ♪ ♪ there's one way out, there's only one way ♪ ♪ even better than going too far ♪ ♪ crawling to the usa ♪ ♪ crawling to the usa ♪ ♪ crawling to the usa ♪ ♪ crawling to the usa ♪ ♪ crawling to the usa ♪ ♪ crawling to the usa ♪ ♪ crawling to the usa ♪ So, how's it going?

What are you talking about? Couscous is delicious. We've got to knock this thing off the air. We're going to put commandos in the studio, and you are going to help US. Me? But why me? Because you are in it up to here. [ Burps ] [ Speaking foreign language ] Boys, get ready for a fanfare, a fanfare for billions. We sold San Diego! All right! Our borders will always be open, and this beautiful city, which I plan to call Tijuana heights... [ Cheering ] Shall become a haven for bargain hunters throughout the world. Monty: That's it. We did it. $28 billion for San Diego. [ Bells ringing ] [ Humming ] Thank you, Jerry. [ Mouling yelling ] All right, gentlemen, let her go. Thank you very much. Thank you. Jerry, let her go. Thank you. Uhh! All right. All right. Jerry, Jerry, I'm ashamed of you. Come on, mellow out, now. Mellow out. Just leave US alone, all right? Leave US alone. We'll be fine. Thank you. Jerry, Jerry, I get that you're angry. I want you to go up to your room now and just relax, all right? We'll talk about it later, okay? Jerry, Jerry, I don't want to tell you again now. Jerry, give US the space to be alone. Goodbye. I'm sorry. Hello, welcome. Hey, what's the trip, man, huh? I don't dig being brought to some dump by a bunch of thugs. Well, I apologize if they hurt or inconvenienced you in any way. I just wanted to meet you so much. You woke me up to meet me? Oh, god! Don't tell me it's fan time, huh? Well, actually I am quite a fan. I don't dig it. I worked late last night. I don't like being treated like a bourger cript. A bourger cript? Bourger cript. Oh, bourgeois creep. Thank you, I got it. Boy, you really say what you feel, don't you? You're damn right I say what I feel, man. I mean, dig it. I'm not impressed with you. I don't care if you're the president of this place. This place suck! I mean, I can't wait to get back to 'nam where thing are together. It's crazy here, man. You just caught america at a bad time. It's been a lousy year for US. I apologize. Can I, uh, can I get you a drink? Alcohol for pig! Look, miss Jackson, the reason I had -- the reason I wanted to meet you was I-I watched your performance on television and I was absolutely riveted by your aliveness, your animal sensuality -- don't you get it yet, stupid? Chet. Do I have to draw you a picture? I don't like you. I don't like your country. I did my bit, and I want to go back to 'nam. Jesus h. Christ! Look at me, goddamn it! Ooh. I'm not a country. I'm not an office. I'm not a decorative seal. I'm a person. I'm a man. I'm a man who wants to make love to you. Oh, you want to pork, huh? Why didn't you say so, man, you know? Dive in. You mean you really want to? Oh, yeah. Come on, man. Dig in, man. I'm so funked up for you, I can't wait. This is so great. I can't -- ugh! The shoes, man. Get the shoes. Oh, come on, man.

Wait a second. If I could just get -- whoo! I love the animal man. Keep it going. Keep it going. Keep the tassel on, would you? Meanwhile, courageous little Chris broder was making his way across the country raising money for the telethon. On the 14th day, his father finally allowed Chris to stop for lunch. Come on, kid. Will you come on? You've had enough food. [ Cheering ] [ Marching band playing ] Girl: Keep going. Man: Keep going. Where is he, Ben? There he is. What's he doing? All right. All right. Come on, ladies and gentlemen, we've been on for 14 days. 14 days, do you hear me? Don't get me wrong, but it isn't good enough! Now, come on. What have you been doing out there, huh? You've been having a ball while monty's busting his butt! What do I have to do to get you people to send US some gold? I want your gold! Hey, what are you doing up -- uhh! Ohh! What do I have to do to get you to participate here? What have I got to do to make you dig down deeper? What do I got to do, grope a sheep? Is that what you want? All right, I'll grope a sheep. You got a sheep? One, move to your left. That's good. Okay, I'll do it, but I better get that money. Hey, nobody's supposed to -- [ choking ] I want the money we made when we sold Puerto Rico. Who is going to do it? What happened to the lights? What the hell's going on, Walter? Are you responsible for this? I don't know -- check it out, mister. I don't like it. What happened to our power? Man: Where are the lights, can't work without lights. [ Crowd screaming ] Monty: Mcmerkin! In here, monty. Who are those guys? I don't know, but they destroyed the electrical system. Well, fix it. Calm down. How long is this going to take? I don't know. The only place they make these parts is China. China? China? The show was blacked out for five days. What did Americans do? They still stayed glued to their sets. Let's face it -- america had become a boring place. Man: Here come the lights. Hey, all right, we're back. We are back! Near tragic circumstances have set US back. We are billions of dollars behind, but I want to tell you something right now. You cannot stop america! ♪ Oh, beautiful ♪ ♪ for spacious skies ♪ ♪ for Amber waves of grain ♪ ♪ for purple mountain majesties ♪ ♪ above the fruited plain ♪ ♪ america ♪ ♪ america ♪ ♪ god shed his grace on thee ♪ Would you look at this talent?

[ Bell dings ] And now, ladies and gentlemen, a special americathon event -- family in-fighting. In this corner -- Larry Miller! And in this corner, his mother -- Mrs. Adele Miller! Yes, it's the world's first mother-son fight. And now, for the blow-by-blow account, Mr. Jimmy Dunphy! This fight has been brewing for over 30 years. Adele has vowed to prove to her son like she's told him a million times before -- your mother's always right. And what a right she has. On the other hand, Larry never writes, so she's really steamed. Mr. Referee, is this any way for a boy to tie his gloves? Shut up, ma! That's no way to talk to your mother, little poopy-butt. I told you not to call me that! Poopy-butt. Poopy-butt! I'm going to kill you, ma! [ Cheering ] Ring the bell. [ Bell dings ] [ Switchboard buzzing ] Ha ha ha. Sonny... I don't want to fight you, ma. She cold-cocked him with a kick to the family jewels. It's all over! [ Fanfare playing ] [ Cheering ] It's working, kid. The money's pouring in. You saved monty's career. He's not going to forget you for this. Ow, monty, that hurts. Bad planning, vanderhoff. Bad planning is why your country is in the toilet. Good planning is why the united hebrab republic is the most powerful nation in the world. Praise the Jews. Or praise the arabs. All: L'Chaim. They can't keep it up. You may be wrong again. Time for another terrorist act. [ Speaking foreign language ] Hey, want a cigarette? You are the most exciting woman I have ever met. Take me with you. Hey, talk sense, Chet. You're the president of the place. You can't leave. I don't care. My most important responsibility is to myself. I love you more than anything. I love you more than my job, more than my country. Hey, you're really into me, huh? I love when you do that. Hey, I once wrote a song about a guy like you. [ Singing in Vietnamese ] [ Doorbell rings ] Hello?

I got to get my socks. [ Muffled shouting ] All right, let's hear it, ladies and gentlemen. All right, put your hands together. All right, boys, that was terrific. All right, kids, thank you. That was wonderful. Skipping rope -- all right! Ladies and gentlemen, I got to tell you, god bless you people. The money is rolling in! What is it, Danny? Look at this. Oh, my god. Is this for real? The president's been kidnapped. [ Audience gasps ] Man: The president. The president. [ Audience murmuring ] You can't let the man die. We have to pay. Losing president Roosevelt would be a national tragedy. What are you talking about? The loss to this country! Who are you kidding? You couldn't stand him! None of US could! Why, you -- [ shouting ] After much painful deliberation, we have decided that we cannot yield to terrorist demands. We cannot give up what we fought so hard to gain. We believe that president Roosevelt would have wanted it this way. [ Cheering ] I don't believe this. Those cheap bastards. How could they do this to me? Not a very popular guy, huh? Could be a trick. Wait till this gets back to 'nam. There's going to be war over this. Take them into the bathroom. Wait a second. Gentlemen, could we just -- ow, ow. Hey, you know something? You guys suck. Mouling, take it easy. These guys are psychotic. No offense. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special treat for you. Do you remember last week we had a man here who almost gave his life for the americathon? He is back to make a bigger sacrifice. The car killer himself -- that's who's here. A nice big welcome for Oklahoma Roy budnitz! How are you? Nice to see them. Hey, hello there. Mighty glad to be here. I know how much you're doing for america, and I just want to do something for america myself. This wonderful man has agreed to auction off a pint of his own blood to the highest bidder. Come on over here. Some of you guys might be having problems in the old &quot;Slam, bam, thank you, ma'am&quot; Department. A little shot of Roy's blood might turn that around. Danny, get that bidding started. Let's start the bidding. I feel great. Plug it in, honey. This great American is going to donate some of his blood. Let's get that bidding started right now. Hey, did you see those numbers going up? They want blood. So it seems. You got $100,000 already? Hey, all right, america. Let's get it to $150,000. I'm talking about real blood. Oh, sure. Why don't we just kill someone onstage? Great idea. Get on it. Are you out of your mind? Unh-unh. You're talking about taking a life. Mm-hmm. I don't believe you. I've got to get out of here.

Oh, look at this kid. Is this something? Is this kid something? He pushed this board through every town and village from fort Lee, New Jersey, to Hollywood, California.

I've been going crazy. Now, look, kid, we need something big out there. Now, I was thinking about selling Seattle. It's over, monty. Yeah, it's going to be, unless you get some excitement out there. What about the killing idea? There's not going to be any killing. Out-of-work actors will do it for 50 bucks. If people don't care enough about saving the country, maybe it's not worth saving. At least let's go down with dignity. Dignity? You want dignity? You want dignity, huh? All right. Here's your dignity! This is what they want. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, kid. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

The americathon is almost over! Audience: Go! Go! Go! Go! Give! [ Bell rings ] Jesus Christ. That's it -- 30 days. We came up $88,000 short. You don't love monty. You don't care! Monty wants to die. I want to die, Danny. I don't care. Bastards. I want to die. I don't want to live. Mr. Birdwater. Birdwater. You came to collect, huh? Go ahead, take it all. I don't care. Here, monty. Huh? You did a terrific job. Great show. Does that make me a bad guy? Wait a minute. This is $100,000. Wait a minute. [ Audience gasps ] It is! It's $100,000! Danny, look! We did it! We did it! Get out of here! I did it! I did it! I saved america! [ Trumpets playing fanfare ] [ Explosions ] [ Bell ringing ] Beautiful. And so we made it, and america went on. But let me tell you what happened to all these people. Soon after the telethon, Lucy and I were married. We had a couple of kids and moved into a terrific station wagon in Beverly Hills. Monty rushmore went directly to a 3-year booking in the state mental hospital. He's now the host of &quot;The tonight show.&quot; the hebrabs released Chet and mouling after the telethon. Vincent vanderhoff almost had his head popped by Jerry, but Vince and Chet made up and left together for Vietnam, where they formed a disco religion which teaches that god speaks through Donna summer. Mouling Jackson is currently living with American actor Warren Beatty. Oh, almost forgot Jerry, but you all know what happened to him.
