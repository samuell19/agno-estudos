- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Where's Mother? Something has happened, I know it has. Don't be childish, nothing ever happens to Mother. - It could be an accident. - Oh, Ilka, darling, shut up. Why are you out of your places? Tess, Ilka. We're worried about Mother, Miss Drake, she isn't here. Kindly get back to where you belong. Yes, Miss Drake. - Have you got a nickel? - I've always got a nickel. Then phone Mother. What happened, doctor, did I faint? Definitely. First time I ever did that. I fainted, huh? I'm so ashamed of myself. Is my face red? The color's coming back. - You're a slave driver. - Now, doctor... You make her carry too much of a load around here. Oh, it's not overwork, doctor. My eldest child graduates today. And suddenly I said to myself... Louise, you must be a hundred years old. Boom, I fainted. I barely got to eat breakfast this morning, graduation excitement, you know. Hello? Yes, yes, she's right here, just a moment. - Your daughter Alix. - Let me have it. - Hel... Now, Louise! - Yes? Yes, of course I'm coming, darling, tell them not to worry. You're not going! Well, I forgot to look at the clock, honey. Yes. Yes, dear, yes, right away. # Far away in a gay fairyland # # Lived a lady fair beyond compare # # not a soul ever will forget # # Everybody everywhere # # Loved the wise lady fair # # Heaven up above could only have designed # # The goodness of her heart # # Then suddenly she disappeared # # No one smiled in all the lonely land # # Hearts to her were so endeared # # Sad were they, so sad to understand # # Came a day, clouds of gray # # --- # # Joy seemed to light up every face # # For in the dark of night # # There shone a star so bright # # Everyone unaware # # Of the star shining there # # --- # # Shining high up in the sky # # No one ever will forget # Jonesy! How's Mommy? - How is she? - Now, children. Children, the doctor told me to tell you he'll be down in a couple of minutes. Jonesy, will you tell me something and tell me true? Sure, honey, sure. Had Mommy been sick without telling us so? Hold your horses, children, everything's going to be all right. The doctor will tell you all about it in a few minutes, so don't you worry. Gee, I wish Dr. Cannon would come down and tell us what's wrong. - I know what's wrong. - How do you know? Mother thinks she's kept it a secret, but not from me. What are you talking about? She's crying inside for Daddy. Oh, she never showed any signs. You only look on the surface, Tess. Deep feelings are always below the surface, way below. Love must be awful. Maybe you're right. I've watched her whenever Daddy's name is mentioned. And I've seen her staring out over the park with a funny look in her eyes. - She's wishing for Daddy. - What else could it be? - Then why doesn't he come home? - Shh! - Is it about... - Shut up! - Is it anything bad? - How is she, Dr. Cannon? There's nothing to worry about. I want to talk to you three girls. Come over here and sit down. Your mother's had a slight attack of nerves, that's all. But she's a very stubborn woman. And you've got to help me win an argument with her. - Of course, we'll help, doctor. - What can we do? You can depend on me, Dr. Cannon. You bet your life I can. I can't persuade your mother to take a boat trip... and get the kind of rest and relaxation she needs... ...if she's going to be herself again. We're just ready to go on a vacation, doctor. She must leave you three girls behind. - But we'd let her rest, really we would. - We'd be so good to her, doctor. I promise you, Dr. Cannon, I'd be on my best behavior. It will be no vacation with you three girls, none at all. Your mother's had some tough years. You don't get in the position she's in without very hard work. And bringing up three girls is a tough job too. Especially if you do a good job and do it alone. And she's done a good job, but she certainly must relax now for a while. And you must make her do just that. Now, if you forget what I've just told you, you don't love your mother the way I think you do. Now you can go up and see her. - Goodbye, doctor. - Goodbye. - Mommy, how are you, Mommy? - Oh, darling. Honey. I'm so sorry I spoiled your graduation. Oh, how can you ever think such a thing? But there was no reason for you to rush home. - Oh, we knew something was wrong. - Nothing is wrong, dear. But we spoke to doctor Cannon. Now, neither Dr. Cannon nor anyone else is running this family for us. We're going on our vacation and everything is going to be lovely. What do we do when we don't want to do something Mother wants us to do? Yes, what do we do? Don't we always say Mommy knows best and go right ahead with what she wants us to do? Sure, we just say we're three darn little fools... ...and go right ahead and do what Mommy says. - Don't we always? - Most always. And here she is. She knows the doctor knows best and she's not showing one speck of a good example. Now, you know there's no rest for you vacationing with us. Oh, Mommy, you know Jonesy and I can take care of everything for a little while. And Mr. Howard can handle the magazine himself for a few weeks. And I'll absolutely let Tess be the boss. And I won't do one thing wrong while you're away. Oh, never mind. Never mind, children, you're too wonderful. All right, all right. I lost, you win. Oh, Mommy, we love you and we want you to get well. - Yes, Mommy. - Oh, sweet. Tess, you sang well today, I was very proud of you. Thank you, Mommy. Sweet, I'm sorry I missed your solo. No, you didn't. Would you like to, um... Oh, yes, hm-hmm. # The dickey-bird whispered # # Haven't you heard # # Spring is here, spring is here # # Spring is here # # The little crow sang a happy hello # # My favorite time of the year # # The croaking frog # # Sang a song on his log # # Lose your blues, lose your blues # # Lose your blues # # The whippoorwill did a triple A trill # # On hearing the dickie-bird's news # # And the cuckoo gave a cuckoo # # To the blue jay # # Who told the lark in the park # # Who responded, howdyoudo, howdyoudo, Jay # # How would you like to go for a lark? # # The bobolink said I think that I'll sing # # Winter's gone, winter's gone, winter's gone # # The dickie-bird said I give you my word # # It ain't gonna snow # # It ain't gonna rain # # It ain't gonna snow any more # All ashore that's going to shore!

I know you will, Howard, you've been very sweet. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. So long, doc. - Goodbye, children. - Oh, goodbye, Mr. Howard. Well, what are we plotting now? It's a surprise, Mommy. We can't tell you now, but I'm sure you'll love it. Come on, kids, we must go. Goodbye, darling. You do everything Jonesy tells you. - Okay, Mommy. - Goodbye, Mommy. - Goodbye, sweetheart. - Have a wonderful rest now. Thank you, I will, darling. - Have a nice time. - Thank you, dear. Remember, you made me go, but I promise you I'll have a perfect time. It would really be perfect if Daddy were going with you, wouldn't it, Mother? Oh, yes... only divorced people don't take trips together, darling. Besides, we've been perfectly happy, haven't we, the four of us? - Oh, yes. - Come on, kids, we must go now. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, darling. - Goodbye. - Thanks again for my posies. Louise, why don't you tell those kids the truth about their father? And break their hearts? Oh, I couldn't. I think your making a mistake carrying on the illusion. - Bye, Mommy, have a wonderful time. - Be careful! Goodbye. What do you want me to do, tell them their father was no good? That he left me flat to bring them up alone without anything? That doesn't even care enough about them... ...to send them a postal card from wherever he is? No, let them think he's a great man. Well, you may be right. Now look here, young lady, After you've had a good night's rest, you'll feel very much better. And if a man shows up that looks negotiable, why, go ahead. Oh, you've been committing slow romantic suicide too long. That's just stupid. Well, goodbye. And in the name of all that's human, have fun. - Goodbye. - Bye. Now, look girls, you leave everything to me and follow my instructions. - How did you find out where he lives? - Everybody knows where he lives. He's the thirteenth richest man in the United States. Thirteenth? Gee, we start with an unlucky number. We'd like to see Mr. Nelson, please. - Are you expected? - Yes and no... Uh, yes, we are! May I have your name, please? Morgan. Our father is Charles Morgan. Will you please have a seat, young ladies. Gee, this is an awful expensive-looking house for only the thirteenth. I beg your pardon, sir, but the three young ladies are here, sir. - That's too many young ladies. - What three young ladies? They say you expected them sir. - Am I expecting three young ladies? - Not that I know anything about, sir. Well, tell them I'm feeding a hungry man and I'm very busy. - Yes, sir. - Oh, wait. - Have they a name? - Morgan, sir. They say their father's name is Charles Morgan. Does Charles Morgan mean anything in my life? I think we have a foreign correspondent by that name. He's somewhere in Africa. - If you wish, I'll see what they want. - All right, but be quick. We're here on very serious business, Mr. Nelson. I'm Mr. Nelson's secretary, my name is Harlow. We have to see Mr. Nelson, Mr. Harlow. Oh, this is absolutely impossible. You wouldn't have gotten this far if you hadn't said you were expected. And even I can only give you a minute. But, um... you don't seem to understand, Mr. Harlow. Yes, I think we should explain everything. - It isn't as if we were strangers... - It's terribly important. - Daddy's worked for Mr. Nelson for years. - Can't we sit down some place? All right, if you promise to tell me your trouble as quickly as you can. What about the sugar, Martin? - Here's your sugar, sir. - Thank you. - Is this one of the young ladies? - Shall I remove her, sir? Oh, please don't let him remove me, Mr. Nelson. I don't think she'll do me any bodily harm. Didn't Mr. Harlow tell you that I didn't have time to see anyone? Yes, sir, he said it was impossible. And you don't like that word any better than I do. You see, I had to see you, sir, because, well... I don't think it's entirely your fault. But my mother fainted and she had to go to Cuba... ...and our family's all broken up. Oh, so it isn't entirely my fault. Couldn't you please let Daddy come home, Mr. Nelson... ...before Mommy gets back. My dear child, I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. Why do people get married, Mr. Nelson? Well, I'll never see the day when I could answer that one. They get married so that they can live together, don't they? And if you won't let them live together, it is partly your fault, isn't it? It surely is if you say so, my dear. What's that? ( In French ) I, um... they were just explaining to me about their father. Well, perhaps you could explain it to me. Mr. Nelson, this is my older sister Tess. - How do you do, Mr. Nelson? - How do you do? And this is my second oldest, Ilka. How do you do? - And you? - I'm Alix Morgan. - How are you? - Fine. You have a very lovely voice, my dear. Well, thank you, sir. I'm quite sure Mr. Harlow agrees with me too. It seems, sir, that our correspondent in Bazzurk hasn't been home for a long time. It's caused a great deal of difficulty. - It was a divorce. - Only temporarily. It was never a serious divorce. Not serious? No, it was caused by those everlasting separations. Now, wait a minute. Just because one of my editors sends your father to Africa on a job, is no reason why he has to stay there if he doesn't want to. Oh, I know Daddy wants to come home and be with Mommy and us. And if he could come home, they could get married again. Oh, we've missed him, so we always have. We could be a happy family again, Mr. Nelson. Oh, please, Mr. Nelson, make us a happy family. Well, I don't like to be an intermediary in this sort of thing, but... I'll do the best I can. - Oh, thank you so much! - It'll be wonderful. Mommy will be very grateful. I hope so. You're a good ambassador, my dear. But you're making me do something that's going to flatten out my nose. - Oh, no. - Oh, yes. Now go home all three of you. - Good night. - Good night, thank you very much. Don't mention it, I'll do the best I can. You'll hear from me in a few days. - Thank you so much. - Get home safe. No, this is your way out. Good night. What is a man doing in Bazzurk when he has a family like that? You know you're supposed to protect me? They softened you up pretty quick, didn't they? How about that little one, sir, and you. Hm? Oh... Well, you see, I never had any children of my own. How does that Humty-Dumpty jingle go? - Humpty-Dumpty who had a great fall? - Yeah. All the king's horses and all the king's men, couldn't put Humpty-Dumpty together again. I never liked that thing. Get Bazzurk on the phone. I think I can put these pieces together very, very nicely. At least I'll try. - Good evening, Mrs. Morgan. - Good evening. - May I show you to your table? - Thank you. Mrs. Morgan, Mrs. Smith. - How do you do? - How do you do, my dear? Thank you. Good evening, I think I'll just have the entr?e, please. - And later a d?mi-tasse. - Very good, Mrs. Morgan. Have you seen the ship's morning paper, Mrs. Morgan? No, I haven't. You're listed amongst the distinguished passengers. Yes, indeed, as a very important editor. It's so thrilling these days. Women holding important places in every walk of life, it's so thrilling. I've forgotten the name of the magazine. Oh, I'm under doctor's orders to forget for a month. Have you a hobby, Mrs. Morgan, a hobby to while away your idle time? Idle time is good enough for me. Oh, everybody should have a hobby. I make a hobby of people. I've already managed a little chat with nearly everybody existing on board. All except Jos? Iturbi. He's just coming now. He played at a concert in Newport. And then at dinner at my cousin's house. I think I'll ask him to play something for us. Oh, Mrs. Smith, I don't think a man of his stature would play at a place like this. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Waiter! Yes, ma'am? Will you give that to Mr. Iturbi with my compliments? Mr. Iturbi, a Mrs. Smith has asked me to deliver this message to you. Thank you. Newport, Mrs. Dillingham, Mrs. Smith? What's that? - Tell her I'm very sorry. - Yes, sir. Wait a minute. - Sir? - Where is this Mrs. Smith? If you look in that mirror, sir, you can see her. Eso es una se?ora estupenda. This is quite a Mrs. Smith. Will you please ask the musicians if they would allow me to play a request? - I would be very much obliged. - Yes, sir. You're not playing for any Mrs. Smith. This is not any Mrs. Smith. It's a long time since I did anything like this. It may be fun. When you've finished, I'll pass around the hat. Look, my dear, he's going to the piano. Thank you very much, gentlemen, it's awfully nice of you. Ladies and gentlemen. We are to be greatly honored. Mr. Jos? Iturbi will play a request for us. He remembers me. Isn't it sweet? I knew he'd remember me. I knew it, I knew it! Shh! Mrs. Smith, it was a great pleasure indeed to play for you. Of course I remember Newport, Mrs. Dillingham, and you, Mrs. Smith. - How could I forget you. - You're very gracious, Mr. Iturbi. Thank you for playing, but, um... This is Mrs. Smith. Perdoname, se?ora, lo siento mucho, ha sido un gran error por parte mia. Pero le aseguro que estoy encantado de haber hecho tal error. - I accept your apology, Mr. Iturbi. - Thank you very much, Mrs. Smith. I'm terribly sorry. Good night. Good night, Mrs... lady. Good night. Oh, Mrs. Morgan, I hope you didn't mind. You know, these great artists always mixing things up. Imagine him mistaking you for me. - What did he say in Spanish? - I don't speak Spanish, Mrs. Smith. But he is charming. - Good evening, Mr. Iturbi. - Good evening. Is everything all right? Yes, everything is all right. If I sat down beside you, if I were corageous enough to do anything like that, would you object to my plight? Mr. Iturbi, I wouldn't mind your sitting down nor your smoking. Thank you very much. I've been looking for you since dinner. I've been in here half a dozen times. I was in the library writing letters. By the way, if you are not Mrs. Smith, may I know who you are? Mrs. Morgan. Oh... Mrs. Morgan. - Merely a legal prefix. - Divorced? Hm-hmm. But not unattached. I just ran across Mrs. Smith and she didn't tell me anything about that. Mr. Iturbi, no celebrity ever ran across Mrs. Smith. Well, she seemed to know a lot about you, how important you are, that you are an editor, you sing beautifully. She wanted to tell me a lot more but I... I ran away. Why? What chance has a woman like Mrs. Smith to know anything about you? So you think you've escaped, do you? Uh-oh! Come. V?mos, no puedo con la vieja. Me pone nervioso. I'll make a scene if you don't. Mr. Iturbi, you should be a very happy man. I agree with you, I should. But why? Because you bring so much pleasure to so many people. Mrs. Morgan, let me tell you how it really is with me. Of course if you are interested. Oh, yes, yes I am. Well, every day I practice. Every day in the week and every week in the year. And all the time I worry, maybe I'm not good enough. You see, there is one thing about music. You always feel there is so much more than you know. Some wonderful secret that you haven't quite captured. So I practice and worry, can't eat or sleep. Then comes the concert. And I play my head off. And... ...it's all over. So you think I eat and sleep? No, I begin to worry about the next one. Oh, but think of the people you've moved and inspired. Yes, and maybe put some to sleep too. Oh, no, Mr. Iturbi, not your concerts. I've been there and seen them. - The crowds. - Yes, crowds... crowds. Mrs. Morgan, a crowd can be a very lonesome thing. But one person, just one... ...can be more than a hundred thousand. But, um... you love what you're doing, don't you, Mr. Iturbi? Of course I do. I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world. But I'd like someone to like me a little... ...in spite of my music. - Mrs. Morgan. - Yes? I have a cablegram for you. Thank you. - Oh, please, don't go yet. - But I must, it's getting late. May we have dinner tomorrow night, perhaps? Thank you, but, um... Perhaps, Mr. Iturbi. I'll see how I feel in the morning. If you don't appear at breakfast, I'll ask you at luncheon. - Good night, Mr. Iturbi. - Good night, Mrs. Morgan. My darlings. I'm looking at a picture of you three and thanking you from my heart for this voyage. It's more interesting than I thought possible. - Love, Mother. - Read it again, Tess. She's already read it three times. What do you suppose she means by "more interesting"? Don't be a dope, trips are always interesting. And boat trips are more interesting. You can look at the engines. Oh, I can imagine Mother looking at the engine. I wonder... Oh, she just means it's interesting, that's all. Hello? Oh, hello, Mr. Nelson. Oh, of course I remember you, Mr. Harlow. Yes. Yes... He is? Mr. Nelson did? Oh, how can I ever thank you? I mean, thank Mr. Nelson. Goodbye, Mr. Harlow. - Gee, he's kind of nice. - Yes, he's nice, what did he say? - Is it about... - (Pig latin) (Pig latin) You don't have to go through all that on my account. I'm not even interested. Daddy's coming home, he's leaving in a week. Oh, it's terrific! Gee, I wish I could let Mother know, but I guess it's best not to excite her right now. Besides, it'll be such a wonderful surprise. Imagine when she... ( Pig latin) Jonesy, are we three wonderful girls or aren't we? Hm, in one way or another you certainly are. (Pig latin) They make a handsome couple, don't they? I don't think so. To me Mrs. Morgan looks bored to death. Don't you think so, Mike? Hm? Oh, yes, yes. Don't you think so, Mrs. Smith? Thank you, Mrs. Morgan, I don't know when I've enjoyed a dance so much. Thank you, Captain. I've tried to get Mrs. Morgan to ask you to favor us this evening. And she said, "Do your own dirty work.". I'm sorry, Captain, but I have been practicing a lot today. - Please forgive me. - Hm, help, Mrs. Morgan, help. Would it be imposing too much if I said please? - That makes it a command performance. - Oh, thank you, Mr. Iturbi. That was so nice of you, Mrs. Morgan. - Ladies and gentlemen... - Just a minute, please. Would you and your friends care to join me on the bridge tomorrow? - If it's convenient, I... - Pardon me, Captain. I can promise you a real treat if Mrs. Morgan will sing with me. Oh... oh, but I haven't done anything publicly... - I said please. - Oh, do, Mrs. Morgan. Yes, please, please do, Mrs. Morgan, please. Oh... well... Ladies and gentlemen, we have a wonderful surprise for you. Mr. Iturbi and a very beautiful lady! # Where there's love # # There's a song # # That will always belong in your memory # # To live evermore # # Something heard long ago # # When two hearts were aglow # # And the world was a dream to explore # # Where there's love there's a theme # # That you found in your dream # # And the thrill of it lives in your heart # # To the stars let it soar # # Till your heart sets on fire # # Where there's love you will find a song # # All through the ages it plays # # Don't let the theme get away # # Where there's love # # There's a theme # # That you found in your dream # # And the thrill of it lives in your heart # # Where there's love # # There's a wonderful song # # Where there's love you will find a song # May I... may I come in for a minute? Yes, certainly. Is it true that you are not getting off here in Havana? May I ask you why? - Who told you? - Mrs. Smith. I should have remembered what the Chinese said. No talk, no tale. But the concert here is for you, as my guest. I'm sorry. Mrs. Morgan, you have made this a very pleasant trip for me. A lonely voyager into a very happy one. But the whole thing is incomplete if I cannot play for you. I'm sorry, but my plans are already made. Change them, it's very important to me. I... I've got out of the habit of changing my plans so fast. You changed it pretty fast since yesterday. Mrs. Morgan, I specially wanted to give this concert because... Because I was so anxious to play for you. I shall be very bad if you are not there. So I say, please, please, Louise. - Well, I... - Thank you! Thank you very much! Usted es una mujer encantadora, admirable, la m?s bella que he conocido en toda mi vida. And I meant every word I said. It's even more wonderful than I thought. Shh! I'm not only speaking for myself when I say you never played so well. Thank you. There were two music critics sitting behind me. They were buzzing and whispering until Mrs. Morgan had to tell them to be quiet. - She did? - Yes, she was so absorbed. If I'd said a word, she'd have hit me with her elbow. I could listen to you all night, Mrs. Smith. Please tell me more. Do you like music well enough, Mr. Pemberton, to go on all the time getting a kick out of his concerts? I just like Jos? well enough to get a kick out of anything he does. - So he wears well, does he? - Twenty-four hours a day. That takes a deal of doing, doesn't it? You bet. I'd like to tell you something. I've never seen him shake up an audience like he did tonight. You know, it would pay us well to carry you along with us. He was playing for you tonight, Mrs. Morgan. And he was great. - Thank you, I... - You're very serious business to Jos?. But I don't want to be serious business. There are reasons why I shouldn't be, I couldn't be. I'm afraid it isn't a question of whether you want to be or you don't want to be. The fact is you are serious business to him. Good night, Mr. Pembleton. Will you please make my apologies to Mr. Iturbi. Tell him a have a bad headache. - Good night. - Good night. - Where is Mrs. Morgan? - She, um... developed a sudden headache. She'll be all right in the morning, they usually are. Mike! Estamos morriendo por tener un baile con la se?ora su amiga. - Who me? - Yes, you. May I have this dance, please? My dear, I'll be all worn out. I'll be right back, Mr. Iturbi. I'll be delighted. - Hello? - I'm so sorry about the headache. Is there anything I can do? No, no, thank you. You're very kind but I'll be all right in the morning. Just a moment, please. Come in. - Mrs. Morgan? - Yes. Thank you. Hello, Mr. Iturbi. The roses are very lovely, you're very thoughtful. Thank you. No... no, thank you. - Good night. - Good night. # You made me love you # # I didn't want to tell you # # I didn't want to tell you # # I need some love, that's true # # Yes, I do, yes, I do # # Indeed I do # # Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme # # What I sigh for # # You know you've go the kind of kiss # # That I'd die for # - Really, Mr. Iturbi, that was very nau... - Mrs. Morgan? - Yes. - Hold the line a minute, please.

What a wonderful surprise. That's the nicest birthday present anyone ever had. Have you opened our presents yet, Mommy? Open Tess's first, mine second and Alix's third. All right, I will. And I just know I'm going to love everything. - How are you feeling, you sound wonderful. - Have you made any nice friends? A few... How have you been? - Wonderful. - Terrific. We've been behaving too. We haven't done one thing wrong. Well, try and keep it that way. I'll see you very soon, dears, and... Darlings, I love you all very much. We love you too, Mommy. Goodbye, Mommy. Why didn't you tell her about Daddy coming home? Oh, I meant to, but... Gee, I thought she would have been so happy that she'd want to rush right home. And she needs that vacation. Now remember, girls, it's a secret until she gets back. Yeah, if we don't buzz. Oh, I hope she has a wonderful time in Cuba. Oh, yes, I hope so. What a delightful place this is. # Feliz cumplea?os a usted # # Feliz cumplea?os a usted # # Feliz cumplea?os, se?ora # # Happy birthday to you # - Happy birthday, se?ora. - Happy birthday, se?ora. Thank you, thank you so much. Happy birthday, Louise. Thank you. How did you know? Sometimes Mrs. Smith actually says something sensible. Now, make a wish and blow them out. - I'm allowed a wish? - And so am I, if you get them all. Well, I... I'll do my best. Oh, I'm sorry. Looks as though we don't get what we want. I wouldn't let a little flinch stop me. Louise, if I ask you something, will you tell me something? Yes, I'll tell you something... if you ask me something. Louise, you like me a little, don't you? And I think you know how I feel about you. Will you... Will you be my wife? I can't let you talk like this, Jos?. You don't understand, There's too much in the way, too many complications. Besides... I've a grown daughter. - That's wonderful. - More than that. - Two? Great, wonderful. - More than two. Three, four, five, six? The more, the merrier. Only three, Jos?. I'm sure they are adorable. I love them right now. Yes, but there's another complication. My ex-husband. They adore him. - Oh, I see. - And I'm afraid it's my fault. I... I didn't tell them the truth about him. They were so young and I... I just couldn't. They have him sort of enshrined. Supposing so. They'll get over it. Children always do. Suppose I guarantee you I'll handle them. - Will you guarantee that? - Absolutely. I love children. They love me. You see, I could be the pied-piper. I give you that guarantee. And now, darling, will you marry me? Don't look so worried, Louise. You're supposed to be happy. But you don't understand, Jos?... That I must break the news to the children first myself. Well, after all, I didn't want to tell them that we were married... ...by cable just like that. Of course not. But I don't think we need to worry about the children. I'm sure there will be no problem. - You don't know the children. - They don't know me. That's just the problem. But when you tell them about me, smile, be cheerful. All right. Goodbye. - Welcome home, Mrs. Morgan. - Thank you. - I'll be back here at nine. - Better make it ten. I'd better go now before you make eleven. - Goodbye, darling. - Goodbye. My, what a surprise! Welcome home, Mrs. Morgan. Thank you, Jonesy. Are they all right, were they much trouble? Oh, just about the same. But, Mrs. Morgan, you look wonderful. Rested and... sort of different. I've a wonderful surprise for you all. I'll see you later. - Mommy! - Baby! - You were so quiet. - Mother! - Am I glad to see you! - Ooh! - Mommy! - Oh, look at sleepyhead. Where did you come from? Oh, sweet. Let me see you all. Gee, we look the same, but you look different. I think you've all grown, specially Ilka. She grows on the double, no one can keep up with her. That's because she drinks lots of milk, which you don't. I think you look older too. And, gee, you look so much younger. Well, I'm younger and you're older. That's an awful lot to happen in such a short time, isn't it? - Oh, Mommy, that isn't all that happened. No, darling? What else? Oh, something else. Well, we might as well tell her now that you two opened the box. Sit down, Mother. My, my, aren't we mysterious. Well, what is it? Daddy's coming home. - Who? Your father? - That's right. You haven't any idea what we had to go through to arrange it. - It wasn't easy. - And I helped a lot. At first it was practically impossible. But when we told Mr. Nelson about your nervous breakdown, cinched it. And you did this without even asking me. It was a surprise. It wouldn't have been a surprise if we had asked you. But you had no right to do it, absolutely none. - But, Mother... - I've always given you a lot of freedom. I can see now I've made a mistake, you've taken advantage of it. How could you dare act for me in a matter like this? What you've done is inexcusable. Childish, clumsy interference. I'm sorry I shouted at you. Please forgive me. Oh, don't cry. You know I didn't mean all those things I said. - Aren't you angry anymore? - Of course not, darling. It was only for a moment. We had only one idea in our heads, Mommy. I know, Tess, you thought you'd make me happy, I've no doubt of that. You had an idea and you thought it was good. So let's not say anything more about it. Come on, snap out of it, darling. Get ready for breakfast. I, um... I've something to do for a little while, but... I'll be back in time to have breakfast with you. Oh, Mommy, please don't go away so soon. I have to, dear. I'll be back as soon as I can. I wonder why she was so upset about it. Maybe we should just let Daddy bust in on her. Maybe we made a mistake. You see... No matter how anxious Mommy might be to see Daddy, she wouldn't want us to arrange it. That's it. But the moment she sees him, she'll change her mind. I hope so. - What's up, William? - There's a lady to see you, sir. Name of Morgan. This early? Those three are gonna starve me to death. - The little one? - I should say it's the big one sir. Oh, that's Tess, I've got to stop her before she starts singing. - Good morning, Mr. Nelson. - Good morning. And please, please forgive me. If I weren't in such dreadful trouble, I wouldn't bother you at this time. I believe you're acquainted with my daughters. Oh, I see, you're the mother with the nervous breakdown. And I'm bringing your husband back from way down under some place. Is he really coming back? Why, yes, Mrs. Morgan, he's already on his way. I'm sorry... you'd better sit down here. Now don't worry, everything is going to be all right. This wasn't easy to do. He didn't want to come back. - But once I made up my mind... - But you don't understand, Mr. Nelson. I don't want him to come back... Charlie, I mean. Oh, then the case isn't as it was presented to me. I can battle presidents and kings and all that sort of thing. But I guess I'm a pushover for kids. Me too. But they're hard to resist, that gang of mine. Well, is there anything I can do to undo what I've done? You see, Mr. Nelson, Charlie Morgan and I have nothing in common left us. The truth of the matter is... I got married on this trip, in Cuba. Oh. Well, go on, go on. Well, I came home alone to tell my children about it, but they surprised me first with the news that they got you to send for Charlie. I knew it, I knew it, I should have kept my nose out of this thing. I'm sure they led you to believe he's a very wonderful person. Yes, and that you were eating your heart out for him. I'm afraid I never quite had the courage to tell them the truth. Oh, I see. So, here I am with a new husband I adore and... ...one I divroced years ago coming head on. Oh, please, Mr. Nelson. Stop him from coming back. But you've got to tell the children some time. Well, I suppose so, but... Imagine my saying, "Look, children, I've brought you a brand-new Daddy." When I turn around, there's Charlie, and I say... "I got rid of this one because he wasn't a good father to you. They'd never think I was lying all these years, they'd think I was lying right now. They might never get over that. Besides, it might put my new husband up against a problem... ...he'd never be able to overcome. Well, I guess I'm not the Humpty-Dumpty fixer I thought I was. I could stop him in mid-ocean, ship him to China or something. Please, Mr. Nelson, just keep him away long enough for my children to get to meet my new husband. And learn to love them as I do. - Well, it's 10 o'clock, I could call... - Ten o'clock? Oh, good heavens, he'll be here any moment. I've got to rush, really rush. - Thank you so much, Mr. Nelson. - You're quite welcome. My children have an instinct for nice people. - I'll do all I can. - Thank you. Oh, and by the way, may I call you a little later... ...to find out how you've made out about Charlie? Yes, but not during dinner. - Bye. - Goodbye. Harlow, please. Oh, Harlow, I want you to stop Morgan from coming back to New York. Hm? Yes, I changed my mind. How do you do, Tess? How do you do, Ilka? And how do you do, Alix? Well, who is going to tell me, please come in, you are most welcome. Please come in, you're most welcome. Thank you, Alix, that's lovely. - Who's that? - A man. - Of course he's a man. - I wonder what he wants. Well, where is everybody? Something's very strange. This is a lovely apartment. It certainly shows excelent taste. He wants to rent the apartment. That's a beautiful view. It's no use, sir, we're not planning to move out. Oh, I know that, but I'm planning to move in. But we have a lease. Oh... that's nice. What do you say, shall I give you these things now, the... the presents I brought for you? Tess. Alix. Ilka. Really, I don't think we should take these. We're planning on living here for quite some time. Unless you want to give them to us anyway, just for nothing. With no obligation. What do you mean obligation? The apartment, it's not for rent. Wait a moment. Do you think I'm here to rent the apartment? - Well, aren't you? - Hardly. I am Jos? Iturbi. You mean... Jos? Iturbi? Now you know why I'm here, don't you? Not exactly, but we're awfully glad to see you. Yes indeed we are. Pardon me, Mr. Iturbi, but, um... - How did you know our names? - Why, your mother told me. Are you sure, girls, she didn't tell you anything about me? About you, Mr. Iturbi? What about you? I wonder why she didn't mention it. - I'm wondering that myself. - Strange she didn't say something. Well, maybe she didn't have the time to tell you. - You see, I met her in Cuba... - Oh, is that why you're here? You see, your mother told me about your voice and how well you sing... - About my voice? - Um, yes, of course, she meant you. So I wanted to find out if that's just, you know, the fond mother. You mean to say you're going to audition me? That's it! I'm going to audition you! Oh, Mr. Iturbi, I just don't know what to say, I can't believe it! - It's terrific, isn't it, girls? - Yeah, it's terrific. - Why is it terrific? - Because he's a famous musician. You know, when you three opened the door and I saw that big smile, I thought of course you were expecting me. We were expecting our father. You were expecting your fa.. father? Any minute now. - I'd better go. - But what about the audition? No, ahora no, otra vez. Otra vez si lo quiere, mas no. Oh, but Mr. Iturbi, now that you're here. Have you told your mother... about your father, I mean. Oh, yes, we have. I'm sorry, girls, excuse me. Are you sure you're Jos? Iturbi? No, I don't think I am... Of course I am! # Je veux vivre # # Dans ce r?ve qui m'enivre # # Ce jour encore # # Douce flamme # # Je te garde dans mon ?me # # Comme un tr?sor # # Cette ivresse de jeunesse # # Ne dure, h?las., qu'un jour # # Puis vient l'heure o? l'on pleure # # Le c?ur c?de ? l'amour # # Et fuit sans retour. # # Douce flamme # # Je te garde dans mon ?me # # Comme un tr?sor # # Et respirer la rose # # Respirer avant de l'effeuiller # # Ah, douce flamme # # Comme un doux tr?sor # # Longtemps encore # # Comme un tr?sor # Bravo! Excellent! This young lady has a very charming voice. That's what you wanted from me, wasn't it? My opinion about her singing. - It's so good of you. - No, it's so wonderful of you, Mommy. Why, I never thought I'd get a great man like Mr. Iturbi to listen to me. - Thank you so much. - Why, thank Mr. Iturbi, dear. Oh, I do, you know I do, Mr. Iturbi. That's quite all right, my dear. Please forgive me for not being here as I said I would, but... I... I had to rush off, it was something very, very urgent. I guessed this much when you weren't here, but... ...everything is all right, I told them everything. - Everything? - Everything about how we met in Cuba, ...how you asked me to come up and hear your daughter's voice. - Do you know what, Mommy? - What, dear? At first we thought it was Daddy. Oh, dear... - He brought us some presents too. - Oh, yes, I know, they're lovely. We shopped for them together in Havana. Go ahead, girls, open your presents. - Yes... - I promise, no obligation. Who are the roses for, Mr. Iturbi? Oh, the roses are for your mother, of course. I think we should put them in water right away. Oh, yes. Alix, dear, will you get the vase, please? Yes, Mommy. This rather complicates things, doesn't it? I almost... - Look, Mother, isn't it beautiful? - Yes, dear. - Thank you so much. - You're very welcome. I had to rush off to see Mr. Nelson. He's Charlie's boss and the children asked him to bring Charlie back to surprise me. - Mommy. - Yes, dear? - Here's the vase. - Thank you. Now go open your present, Alix. Tell me, why is this man bringing who back? Gosh! This has certainly been a sensational morning. How can I ever thank you, Mr. Iturbi? - Just keep singing the way you did. - Well, I'll try to do even better. Mr. Nelson is my ex-husband's boss. After I talked to him he said he'd do his best to forestall him, but... It may not work. - But why, if he's away... - Mrs. Morgan, breakfast is ready. - Thank you. - Come on, children. - He may be arriving any day. - Your ex-husband? Hm-hmm. Louise, is there anything I can do? No, we'll just have to wait and see. You've already been so wonderful. How in the world were you able to hurdle things this morning? But I can see the children fell in love with you. Of course if I were to tell them now, it might change that to something else. I won't rush you, Louise, everything will be all right. Mommy, can't Mr. Iturbi stay to breakfast? Oh, please, Mr. Iturbi. I wish I could, but I have to run. I have a concert tonight. But I got an idea. How would this wonderful family like to be my guests tonight? Oh, could we, Mommy? We haven't been out together in so long. - And if I'm to have a musaical career. - Thank you very much, Mr. Iturbi. Does that include me too, Mr. Iturbi? Of course it does. Well, what do you say, Mrs. Morgan? Well, it looks as though my family had already accepted your very kind invitation. Thank you. It will be a great joy to play for you all. I still don't get it. Why is he so sweet? - And why invite all of us? - Well, maybe he likes us. You parked your brains when he said you could sing. Now look here, miss know-it-all, what's eating you? Nothing you'd understand. Shh. My, how pretty you look! Darlings, I don't know which one of you looks the prettiest. Oh, you do, Mommy. - Shall we get our wraps? - Okay, all right. Of course, Jos?. I'm sure they enjoyed themselves. Yes... oh, darling, you were wonderful with them. Hm-hmm, I will. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night. - Darling, is anything the matter? - No, Mother. I just couldn't sleep. - Like to stay in here with me. - I should like to, for a little while. - What is it, darling? - I, um... I... I was just wondering if... What were you wondering, dear? Mommy, if Daddy had come today, would you have liked it? What's on your mind, Ilka? Mother, why did you and Daddy get divorced? Because he was away from home so much? - That's only part of it, dear. - But you loved him, didn't you? Yes, when we were first married, we loved each other very much. How about right now? Well... being such a long time ago and... ...so many things that happened since. If I hadn't seen you for a long time, I'd still know I loved you. Yes, dear, and I'd know I still loved you, no matter how long we were apart. If I loved anybody, I'd love him forever. I think you would. - So you must be very careful. - About what? About giving your love. If you find someone who wants you with all his heart, it can be very beautiful. - I'll give it to the one I marry. - Then it will be very beautiful. And it would never change, even if we were separated. Even if we were divorced, it would never change. Then you'll be very happy or... or very unhappy. Look, dear, there are things I want to say to you. You're big enough to understand. But... oh, it's been a long day and I'm too tired. You should be asleep, come on. Aren't you and I just the same, Mother? Very much the same, dear, except for one thing. The years. The years are between us. Is that so important? I'm afraid it is. And yet I don't believe I can tell you why. Only the years can do that. - I don't understand it. - No, of course not. You see, Ilka, I've been your age. You'll get to be mine, so... ...you're at a disadvantage. But it wasn't Daddy's fault he had to be away from home so much, was it? It's his work. I'm sure he wants to be here, and now we can fix it. We're very friendly with Mr. Nelson, he'll get Daddy a job right here in New York and... And there won't be any more separations. That makes sense, doesn't it, Mommy? Look, darling. Things don't work themselves out in just a minute. But... But tomorrow, you and Tess and I, yes, and Alix too, we'll get together and talk things over. We won't do anything except what will make us all happy. Now, to bed, young lady. - Mother. - Yes, dear? - May I ask you a question? - Yes. How much do you like Mr. Iturbi? I like him very much. And when you get to really know him, you'll like him too. Very much. Now, there's nothing in the world for you to worry about, darling. Not a thing. Don't worry. Good night, sweetheart. Good night, Mommy. What is it, hon? What is it? - Shall I call Mother? - No, don't, please... don't bother me. - What's the matter? - I don't know. I just talked to Mother. She said she likes him very much. - She likes who? - Yes, who? Make sense. Mr. Iturbi. - Did she say that? - Just now when you were asleep. I went in the room and asked her. I had too. - And she said that? - Yes. It's the way she said it. I think she wants to marry him. No, no, I know. She'll never marry Mr. Iturbi or anybody. Oh, yes, she said more. She said when I got to know him really, I'd like him just as much. She's hypnotized, that's what I think. We've got to do something. And, Tess, you've got to stop being selfish thinking about your voice. You've got to think about us, the family. Yes, I... I know I have been selfish. We've got to show him that if he breaks into this family, it will make things so awful for him that he'll quit. I don't want to interrupt you. The only time you really interrupt me is when you're not here by my side. Come, darling, come, please. Gentlemen, may I have the pleasure to introduce to you my... My, um... soloist. - She's going to sing for us. - Oh, no, Jos?, I couldn't. But, Louise, it's only a rehearsal, you can't refuse now. - Please, darling. - All right. But what'll I sing? # I'll forsake the world for you # # I will make your every dream come true # # With long days and nights of love # # We will climb to the heights of love # # And our happiness we'll share together # # Just as lovers do # # Sweethearts who need no crown or throne # # Sweethearts who live on love alone # # Will find a paradise somewhere # # Leaving behind all wordly care # # Sweethearts today will never fade # # Like an eternal serenade # # Our love will lead the very stars # # Forever we'll be sweethearts # # Our love will lead the very stars # # Forever we'll be sweethearts # Thank you, gentlemen. Take fifteen minutes, please. You were magnificent, Mrs. Soloist. - Thank you, maestro. - Thank you. - Jos?. - Yes, darling? I've decided to tell the children about us right away. - Did anything happen? - Well, something's brewing in their minds. Will you come with me right after rehearsal? And we'll tell them we're married. - Of course I will. - Good. Louise, on second thought I feel I should have one more visit with the children alone. I want to get closer to them. I want them to find out how much I love them already. So when we tell them about us, they'll know I'll do my best to be a very good father for them. - Is it all right with you, Louise? - Oh, of course, darling. - Good afternoon, Jonesy. - Good afternoon, sir. Mrs. Morgan is still downtown. Shall I tell the children you're here? No, I'll announce myself. Are they upstairs? Yes, sir. Here he is. Now remember, united we stand, divided we fall. I don't think it'll work. You do what we said. Say nothing. All right. I'll say nothing. Hello, there. Lovely day. Isn't it beautiful music, this. - Specially for you. - I don't like it. You don't like it, Ilka? No. Well, well. And you, Alix? I say nothing. Why don't you like it, Tess? This is Saint-Sa?ns' Allegro Appassionato. Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Iturbi, I detest Saint-Sa?ns. And to tell you some more truth so long as we're at it, all so-called great music really bores me stiff. Well, that's honest, anyhow, and honesty is the best policy. What is your style, Tess? # If you ever plan to motor west # # Travel my way, take the highway # # That's the best # # Get your kicks on Route 66 # # It winds from Chicago to L.A. # # More than two thousand miles all the way # # Get your kicks on Route 66 # # Well, it goes through St. Louis # # Joplin, Missouri # # Oklahoma City is mighty pretty # # You'll see Amarillo # # Gallup, New Mexico # # Flagstaff, Arizona # # Don't forget Winona # # Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino # # Travel my way, take the highway 66 # # And pick up sticks # # It winds down from Chicago to L.A. # # Just about two thousand miles away # # Get your kicks on Route 66 # # Well, all right, then # # When you travel take 66 # # Route 66, Route 66 # # Hit the road, boy # # Take 66 # Very good, Tess. I like it very much. I like all music that makes people happy. But it was not quite in the groove. I imagine you girls have done exactly what you planned to do. You've made me feel very unwelcome. That is the idea, isn't it? Yes, that's exactly the idea. Mommy belongs to us. Of course she does, darling. Of course. I wish I were so sure about anything as you are about everything. Goodbye, young ladies. So he runs away when he hears hot music, huh? Keep quiet and follow him. And be careful that he doesn't see you, too. - Why do I have to follow him? - Now get going, he'll go away. If he goes to Mother's office, phone us here. Why can't you? Now quit arguing, you're little and he won't see you. Now go on, we have other things to do. - Do you think we did the right thing? - Of course. I hope so. - Oh, hello, Jack. - Hello, Tony. - How about that special? - I think we have it. Boo! Hello. Young lady, you and I are going to have a little talk. Oh, no... - Just a... - I'd like to see Mr. Nelson. - Well, I... - My name is Jos? Iturbi. - Yes, but I... - Tell him it's very urgent. It's about the Morgan affair. Morgan? Oh. Will you please wait here? No, no, I won't see anybody until I finish this snack! - Mr. Jos? Iturbi, sir. - The piano-playing fellow? - I think so. - Oh, show him in. - Yes, sir. - I'm already in, Mr. Nelson. Boy, upon my soul, it is Jos? Iturbi. - How do you do, how are you? - How do you do, sir? Mr. Nelson, you have a reputation for being inaccessible, I'm taking no chances. - What can I do for you? - You have already done it. When a man gets married, it's because he wants to live with some woman... ...he likes well enough to get married to. Isn't that so? Yes, that sounds reasonable. But what do you do, Mr. Nelson? You reach down into the darkest Africa for someone and break up my happy marriage. Where's Charles Morgan? Charles Morgan! I knew it! Every time I sit down to eat a meal, the name of Charles Morgan pops up. And I'm getting sick and tired of it! Oh, by the way, let me congratulate you. She's a very charming woman. Thank you, Mr. Nelson, I think so to. In fact, I'm sure of it. But where is this Charlie Morgan? Well, he's on a tramp steamer bound for China. Then get him off, please, then get him on an airplane. The fastest airplane. And bring him back here where those children can get a look at him. Where I can get a look at him. They don't remember him, but their mother sold them the idea.. ...,that he is Hercules, Apollo and General MacArthur all rolled in one. Do you see what I mean? I think I do. And I agree with you. - Thank you, Mr. Nelson. - You're quite welcome. I'll do what I can. - Thanks. - Oh, Mr. Iturbi. Let me tell you something. Now mind you, I'm going to bring Charlie Morgan back. I don't know much about family life, but if I were you, I'd get my hat, and my cane, and my wife and I'd tell those kids I was married. I think you've got something there. Thanks a lot. - Good day, sir. - Goodbye. Hello. Where's Charlie Morgan now? Hm-hmm. Well, stop him before he gets there and bring him back. Never mind what I said before. I've gotta get him back here so those kids don't think... ...he's Hercules, Apollo and Gen. MacArthur all rolled in one. And so Iturbi can tell those kids he's married to their mother. Yeah, goodbye. Alix! Alix Morgan, where have you been? Now come back here and take off those glasses, we know who you are. - I've been to the zoo. - To the zoo? But you were supposed to follow him. - I did! - And then what happened? I caught up with him. I suppose he asked you a lot of questions, and of course you blabbed. He did not ask questions and I didn't blab. All I said was, I said... "Mr. Iturbi, it's mean to hypnotize Mommy." And he said, "Sweetheart, we will not talk about that." And that's all. - You traitor! - I think he's nice. Nobody's asking you to think. Shh! - Hello! What's the matter? - Nothing's the matter, Mother. We were just having a little conversation. Oh, hello, Mr. Iturbi. - Hello, Mr. Iturbi. - Hello, girls. Girls, go sit down over there, will you? I want to talk to you. What I'm about to say to you is something very important to me. And to us as a family. In front of strangers, Mommy? No, dear, not in front of strangers, just the five of us. Five? We're not five, we're four. No, we're five. I don't have to tell you, you girls are the most important things in my life. If anything were to hurt you, it would hurt me even more. So I hope you'll try to understand what I'm about to tell you. What is it, Mother? Mr. Iturbi and I are married. Married? Yes, we were married in Cuba. Without even asking us? I hardly thought it necessary. But, Mother, we've never done anything without consulting each other first. Now, girls, for the haste of our marriage, you can blame me. Your mother wanted to wait and talk it over with you. But I persuaded her not to. You see, I'm very much in love with your mother. And I want you children to open your minds and your hearts and try to adjust yourselves. Not fight us, unless you have some real reason. If we want our own father instead of some stranger we hardly know, Isn't that good enough reason? Tess! Oh, Mother, how could you? Just when we were arranging for Daddy to come home to... to... To what? Just to marry you again. Please stop thinking like that, it's... it's wrong. Why is it wrong, Mother, you don't love Mr. Iturbi, do you? Yes... I do. - Excuse me. - Tess. Me too. Honesty is the best policy, isn't it, Mr. Iturbi? - Maybe they won't come back. - They'll come back, darling. But Mommy, they said that they wouldn't come back if you and Mr. Iturbi didn't... No, they'll come back, darling, everything'll be just as it used to be. Don't cry, baby. You know I'd never let anything make my girls unhappy. - But, Mommy, they said that... - Never mind what they said, darling. I promise you that nothing, nothing in this world will keep us apart. Now, don't cry, don't cry. There you are. I beg your pardon, sir. Don't tell me. I know who it is, I know. - It's dinnertime. - Shall I serve... Stay where you are. This time there's going to be no piano-playing, yodling or bamboozling. Get away from that piano! Haven't you children ever heard of a telephone? Come here, all of you. Where's the other one? - We're all alone. - Oh. - Now, then. - Mr. Nelson, - We're in trouble. - Oh, of course you are. This is a crisis, Mr. Nelson, and you've got to help us. Mommy married someone without our consent. Did she, now? Did she indeed? Yes, sir, and we didn't know a single thing about it. So you see, we're not responsible. I don't think she is, or she wouldn't have done it, I know she wouldn't. I think he hypnotized her. Please, sir, can you keep Daddy away just for a little while? - Only until we figure things out. - You see how important it is, don't you? I certainly do. Sit down! I know that this is a fast-moving world and times have changed. But I didn't think things were so changed. That children told their parents who and when to marry. I know your mother is married again, and to a very fine man. But don't you see what a mistake it is, with Father coming home? Yes, with the dazzling speed of a rheumatic snail. Suppose I told you your father didn't want to come home? That I forced him to. No, but you don't mean that. I certainly do mean it. When you asked me to help you, you led me to believe... that by keeping your father at the far ends of the earth... ...I was making your mother sick! Now, my dear children, your father refused to come home... ...until I gave flat orders. Perhaps he thought there was something idiotic about it anyway. Perhaps he just forgot all about you. What should we do? I'll tell you what to do, mind your own business. Your mother is a young and beautiful woman and has a right to live her own life. And if you don't know what I'm talking about, go out and find yourselves a couple of birds and bees and have a chat with them. Now, when you came here, you asked me to help you out. And that's exactly what I'm going to do. Out! And if you show your faces around here again, you're headed for a good sound spanking. - Mr. Nelson... - Out! - But... - Out! We have a taxi waiting and no money to get home with. - Oh, William! - Yes, sir? Pay the taxi man and give them their fare home. One way! You know, I'd give anything if I had a couple of kids like that. - Have we an office in Tibet? - Yes. Send Charlie Morgan there. - But, Mr. Nelson... - Don't argue. Send him to Tibet. And arrange a long-term contract. - Yes, sir. - Wait. Cable and get all the information you possibly can... ...on his activities in the past five years. Yes, sir. - Where's Mother? - I'm not talking to you. - But we're talking to you. - Where's Mr. Iturbi? I'm not talking to you either He's gone and he'll never speak to any of us again. It's all your fault. They could have stayed married, but you're so... so know-it-alls. Do you mean that Mr. Iturbi is gone for good? Uh-huh. Well... well, where is Mother? I'm not talking to you! She's upstairs. Yes, I know, Howard, I know I've already had a vacation, but... I've got to get the girls away for a few weeks, they're so upset. Yes. Oh, don't question me, Howard. No, we're separated. I'll see you at the office after dinner. Goodbye. Come in. Oh, hello, Tess. - Hello, Mother. - Where's Ilka? She's down having dinner. Why aren't you? Oh, Mommy, I just have to talk to you. - Not now, dear. - Oh, but I must. Ilka and I are so sorry. Gosh, if we'd only known. Please, Tess. Remember this? # Now once again # # Have I seen spring at hand # # And winter a vagrant # # Hedges and trees # # By the south wind would bend # # Their blossoms so fragrant # # So fragrant # # Now once again # # When the ice from the land # # Of north are going # # Up the river I saw a perfect bend # # With bright waters flowing # # Green grew the grass # # And the meadows once more # # --- # # --- # # --- # # Ah, wondrous magic # # Of springtime # Oh, Mommy, I'm sorry I was so rude. Yes, I know, dear, now stop crying and everything's going to be all right. Just as it used to be. Remember that vacation we planned, the four of us? Well, we're still going. Mommy. Ilka and I were so wrong about Mr. Iturbi and about everything. Listen, children, and listen hard. My job in life is right here in my arms. And that's where my heart is. You're dearer to me than anything or anyone ever could be. Mr. Iturbi realized that. This could be no happiness for any of us if we're not all happy. He's a very good man and I... I just couldn't ask to take any more of this rough going. But, Mother, we've made such a mistake. No, dear, I made the mistake long ago, by... ...by keeping things from you. By not telling you the truth about your father and me. Sit down, dears. Every woman marries for a lifetime. It's great luck for a woman when it happens that way. I wasn't so fortunate. I didn't want to get married again. When I think back now, it frightens me a little that I could have done it without letting you know. Even at my age you can lose your head, do things first and then think afterwards. But I didn't forget you entirely. I felt that my marriage would not only make me happy, but... But it might give my girls some of the fun they missed by not having a father. I wish I could do something about it now. You can, dear. You can help me get over it by... ...by not worrying about it any more. Anyhow, I'm the most foortunate woman in the world. I have my three daughters. I should have known that's enough happiness for any woman. Now go on downstairs all of you and get your supper. I've got to go to the office and arrange about that vacation. I've got to do something. And undo what we've done. Alix, Ilka, I've got an idea. Come on, let's go. I don't think it's going to work. - He looks awfully mad. - Oh, stop being such pessimists. - It must work. - Why don't we call Mr. Nelson? Oh, no, no, that's out! Why, he's a nice man. Don't ask. We have to go through with this. What's his hurry? Trying to catch a train or something? I don't know. Mr. Iturbi, I want to apologize. All right, Ilka, I accept your apology. I have to go, goodbye. But it's all my fault. Tess had nothing to do with it. I started it. And ruined Mommy's life. And now you've got to listen to me. Listen, Ilka, you may have started it. But it ended with your mother feeling we made a mistake. Well... if we get Mommy to change her mind, would you change yours? You have done enough planning and plotting for a little girl. You shouldn't be out so late. Go home, and stop worrying your mother. Good night, Ilka. Please, Mr. Iturbi, please listen to me. I want you to know it isn't Ilka's fault. I'm the oldest and I'm to blame. If we could only start all over again. Look here, Tess, this is not a game to be tried over and over again. When I wanted to include you in my plans, you wouldn't let me. And now you're out of them, and that's the way it's going to be. Goodbye, Tess. I've got to catch a plane. Goodbye. Hello. I know, don't tell me, it's all your fault. No, it isn't. It's Tess and Ilka's fault. I liked you the first time I saw you. Me too, Alix. Mr. Iturbi, you've got to come home with me. Mommy's so unhappy, and so are we. Does your mother know you are all here? Gosh, no. She's at her office working. You take this child home immediately. And if you ever go out this late again without your mother's permission, I'll see you get spanked if I have to do it myself. - Now get out! - But aren't you coming with us? I haven't the slightest intention of changing my mind. Good night. But... We just can't let him get away. But what can we do? - I don't know. - We've got to do something. Hm, let's all think. This is, um... this is my selection for the September cover, do you like it, Howie? - Yes, that's all right with me. - Now, about the November issue. Here. Yes? Yes, she's here, just a moment. Thank you. Yes? Oh, Mr. Nelson! No, I'm sorry, I couldn't possibly come right now. Oh? Oh, I see. Yes, yes... Oh, yes, of course, I'll come right away. All right, yes. - What's the matter now? - My ex-husband's arrived. He's at Nelson's now. - What'll I do? - Do you want me to go with you? Oh, no, thank you, Howie, I think I'd better face him alone. Oh, won't you come in? Where is he, Mr. Nelson, when did he get here? About a half an hour ago. He's in the drawing room. I think before you go in, you'd better read this. - But why did you say that he... - All I said was your ex-husband was here. # A little crow sang a happy hello # # The favorite time of the year # # The croaking frog sang # # His song on his log # # Lose your bues, lose your blues # # Lose your blues # # The whippoorwill did a tripla-A trill # # On hearing the dickie-bird's news # # And the cuckoo gave a cuckoo # # To the blue jay # # Who told the lark in the park # # Who responded, howdyoudo, howdyoudo, Jay # # How would you like to go for a lark? # # The bobolink said I think that I'll sing # # Winter's gone, winter's gone, winter's gone # # The dickie-bird said I give you my word # # It ain't gonna snow # # It ain't gonna rain # # It ain't gonna snow any more # - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
