[♪♪] MALE: Primary school class 2004 That was the last time we were there. Probably one of the last times we were all together. I had no interest in going back. They shut the place down after Will Carter went missing. Nine years old. He was in the year below so I only knew him by face. But that was pretty much the end of trips to Fountainhead Creek as I knew it. It was no place for kids. After that summer we all went off to secondary school. At the time, I remember, it seemed like a big deal. But after a while, life just happened and we never looked back. We grew up. We changed. FEMALE: D'you know that when stags compete y'know when they fight each other at the start of mating season that the winning stag naturally releases a surge of testosterone? Really? Yep. Then he get's to mate with all the ladies- that's the prize. Loser gets nothing. Ouch. What's this got to do with anything? [NATTERS] MALE: I think the first time I fell in love with Charlotte Menary I was seven years old. She kissed me on the cheek during break time after I helped pick up the remains of her broken pencil case. She probably won't remember that. But me - being the kind of tit I am - I never forgot. Charlotte has been seeing my best friend Matt for nearly a year. He's a cool guy - but also kind of a prick. He'll never know how lucky he is. Mmm, smells good Angie! ANGIE: Oh, timing! Leg or breast Matt? Ooh, tough choice! MALE: And this is me. Reece. Most of me is locked inside. At least that's how I feel. [DOOR] Aww, come on, get your stuff Char and Abby are already at the jetty! So it's happening now? Yeah- why is it so fucking dark? Oh, I was developing but they weren't -- Oops! Sorry. It's fine. Well where's your bag then? Listen, Matt - I'm not really feeling it anymore. What? Why? [SIGHS] Matt. Aww, come on Reece, you gotta come to this one! Where we going then? The fucking Fountainhead! Fountainhead Creek? Yeah! Mike found a way in! He won't even remember me. Course he will! And the girls wanna see you too! [SARCASM] Yeah. I'm talking about Joe fucking Richardson! Err - we were ten! You'll remember when you see her! [SIGHS] Her and her friend hang out with Mike and the band and from what I hear they're sluts! [♪♪] REECE: Sometimes with Matt it's easier to just give in and say yes. That's how he gets what he wants. Aww, he's wearing that shirt you bought him. Really? [SKIDS] MATT:[SIGHS] She's still a bit - with me. Remember what I told you about women? Tell me I'm right. [LOUD CAR STEREO] It's Mike! What's going on with my hair? 'Au naturel'! - Shit, shit! MIKE: All aboard ladies! [♪♪] Woo! [LAUGHTER] REECE: Believe it or not I have no vivid memory of Mike Even the most unforgettable people are forgettable. [LAUGHTER] I wonder what that makes me? [♪♪] BRASH GIRL: Here, come on! You don't believe me? Alright. Ooh, nearly nearly [GROANS] Hey! Not fair! You went Lakes with Matt didn't ya? Yeah. You're still friends? That's so sweet! Reece, if I were you mate I'd watch out for this one. Don't act like you know the boy! I know Shannon! You know Sh--? Shannon Buckmaster? SHA-nnon! Yeah. If I were you Reece, I'd look out for her. Too late, Gav's fucked her! [GASPS] Mate come on, that's his sister! What? Oh shit. Sorry mate, I didn't mean that. She is seventeen Mike. Ho ho ho! Even worse! Shannon you dirty little bitch! Just you wait 'til big bro gets home- He ain't gonna be happy you've been out and about getting it out! Mike! Reece, I wouldn't worry what it is, right it's 'cos girls like Shannon feel comfortable around guys like Gav 'cos he has the outer appearance of a caring homosexual. [LAUGHTER] Thing is, me and Gav exude an- aura of sensitivity. and then when girls come to us we're like - BANG, BANG BANG BANG BANG! fucking Rambo! Ha ha ha! [LAUGHTER - CHATTER] [♪♪] [REVVING BOAT ENGINE] [♪♪] REECE: The perimeter fence was something we'd grown to accept in our small town. Like the way you accept roadworks or a construction site. Lend us a hand someone. JO: Oh my God! We should-- just about! KAYLEIGH: Good, 'cause I'm not swimming in that! You won't have to! REECE: For Mike - the fence symbolised everything we had been denied at Fountainhead Creek. Getting to the other side was unthinkable. MIKE: It's piss! Come on. REECE: It was an escape. MIKE: Just tease this slightly. Now I know you're good at teasing! GAVIN: It's gone high tide Mike. I know! So when I shout go I need you to start easing the boat through. Might wanna hold on to your bag! [ENGINE BUILDS] Ready? Off you go Jo! [SCREAMS] Slowly! Shit! I'm so sorry. I'm shit at driving. [MUFFLED GROANS AND BANTER] [♪♪] Ha ha, take your shirt off! [MATT GROANS] JO: That's better! [ENGINE FADES TO DISTANCE] [WIND] [BOAT ENGINE] [♪♪] [ENGINE COASTS] [ENGINE COASTS] MIKE: That's it Newbury! [GIGGLES] REECE: Places like the Fountainhead always seemed so big and exciting when you're a kid. And that was what we all grew up treasuring. Me, Matt, Charlotte - ABBY: You guys need a hand? MIKE: Oh yeah?! REECE: No one saw any danger in it. ABBY: We need a word. MATT: Why? Just - What was that about between you and Jo on the boat? What, arm wrestling? You let her take your shirt off right in front of Charlie! I mean, what the fuck! Well she fucking ripped it! That's a bullshit excuse! How is that an excuse?! 'Cos it is! ABBY: If someone ripped my skirt I wouldn't let them take it off! MIKE: Why the fuck not! [CAMERA CLICK] Heya. Hi. How are y-- GAVIN: Charlie! I just wanted to say, Sorry [VOICE DROWNS OUT] ABBY: Listen - just be careful, OK? I am being careful. Well, not just careful- caring. Just - think about what you're doing and how it might look to everyone else. Oh like you do basically? MIKE: Anyway- Matty boy! Are you ditching me? Sorry to steal him away! Can I come? It's muscles I need, Abby- not a pretty face! [LAUGHTER] [ELECTRONIC EAVESDROPPING] [CLOSE HEAVY BREATHING] [BOAT ENGINE REVS] [LAPPING WATER] [DEAD WIND IN TREES] ABBY: I guess he's just, like - really passionate about his music it's nice- CHARLOTTE: I knew you liked him! No! It's just - most guys don't know what they want out of life at least he's ambitious! I've got wood! You know that joke's getting really old now? I was being serious that time. Good! Then I can safely say that I've got wood too! That's weird. Might work for some though! ABBY: Right. GAVIN: Does that mean that, er- you wear the trousers then? Oh Charlie's definitely a trouser-wearer. Great! I love a woman with power! There's some. Eww, I'm not touching that. What even is it? [LAUGHTER] Look, he didn't go with them actually! Ooh, you might wanna watch out Reece! Why? Two of us - One of you! [LAUGHTER] ABBY: In case you didn't notice I stopped laughing at you ten minutes ago. Sorry, which one of you has the boyfriend? Let's go, my feet hurt. Sorry, I genuinely am not aware of this - who has the boyfriend? Me. It's not Reece is it? No it's Matt, give Reece a break. Fuck, I'm getting it from all angles today. I'm not even gonna comment. [SCREAMS] Oh God, what now? [MORE SCREAMS] [BOAT APPROACHING] JO and KAYLEIGH: Hey hey! Come come par-tay! [LOUD STEREO APPROACHES] MATT: Come on Gav! Woo Hoo! Come on Gavin. Woohoo! Come on Newbury! [♪♪] Oh fuck. My little sister Shannon was always an angel. Until she hit seventeen. That's when it all changed. It's like she was in a rush to experience life to its fullest. To have fun. Like time was running out. [♪♪] [♪♪] Oh my Gawwd. Shan! Hey! What are you doing? What? You can't just turn up, tonight has nothing to do with you! Matt invited me. Matt did? Yeah...? Oh fuck. What? What don't say fuck? Do I go around turning up to your parties? To be honest, I'm surprised to even see you here. Why? Because you're hardly a fucking socialite! Do you like someone? Hardly a socialite? At least I have my own friends. These guys are my friends. Err- no they're not, they're mine! Matt's your friend. I went to school with these guys. I hang out with them. They only hang out with you because they wanna fuck you! Gavin's obsessed with you! You think I'd shag Gavin? I dunno. Mike seemed to think you already have. Mike talks shit, everyone knows that. Do they? What is wrong with you? Me?! I'm not the one hunting for a new social life now that I'm cool and not wearing 'Little Mermaid' lip gloss! Studying fashion opened my eyes- It has nothing to do with socialising! Err-- opened your eyes to what? Why don't you open your eyes Reece? Stop seeing life through your fucking Polaroid? It's not a Polaroid. Whatever it is it keeps you locked in a dark room. Either get out of it, or fuck back off there! I don't need a dark room for a digital. You need to come up with a better... metaphor. [LOUD DANCE MUSIC FROM STEREO] ABBY: Eagle Eye records? Why Eagle Eye? Well, Eagle was my father's maiden name. Your surname? Precisely. Mike Eagle. Is that your real name? well it used to be Rocket, but - I thought it sounded a bit too - egotistical. ABBY: Right. MALE: Beer boys? Shannon? [GIRLY LAUGHTER] MATT: Reece! [MOCKING LAUGHTER] You're pissed at me aren't you? Hey, come on, you wanna see something funny? Come here. These two - These two are absolutely - disgraceful! [BRASH LAUGHTER] KAYLEIGH: It's fine - he doesn't like us Matt. Oh no, it's not that. He's just in a bit of a strop with me. JO: Why? What did you do? Well I may have just fuelled some- sibling rivalry. JO: Oh come on Reece! You need to enjoy yourself. Have a drink! [LAUGHTER] MALE: Hey! I noticed that you don't have a drink. Thanks. Charlotte...? Menary. Menary! Shit, that's it. You are... Chris? Cheers. So, how's life treating you? Sorry Chris, one sec. [URINATING] Matt? Hey, you alright? Why you avoiding me? I thought you wanted some space? No. Well I'm in a no win situation here aren't I? I said I was sorry and - that didn't quite seem to be good enough. So you avoid me? If I'm honest - I thought if I stopped coming to you - you would come to me. What's that supposed to mean? Well you're kind of needy. I'm needy? Well yeah, but that's a good thing because now we can work it out - I'm not here to resolve anything! Well, then what? Can't you see I'm waiting? For what? For a meaningful apology - a hug - anything to show you actually care! Jesus Charlie! I don't just say I'm sorry for the hell of it! I know I might seem like a safe girlfriend to you - Like someone who's always gonna be there regardless. But believe me, right now you need to earn that back! But you keep fucking off all the time - - and it's starting to take the piss. No one needs that much attention Matt. No one normal - Why the fuck do you need it? Ok, on the boat that was an arm wrestle - I'm not even referring to that. Then what? That girls like me? I can't help that! Wow. That's modest of you Matt. Well it's true! Then why are you with me? I don't - cos you're not like the other girls. When I'm with you, I have to work harder. That's reassuring. Look - I'm sorry. I was fucking stupid! I didn't mean any of it. You know - I hate this. I just want things to go back to the way they were. I only go to other people - to just distract my mind. Your fucking weird mind. My fucking weird mind. Sort it out Matt. Please. [♪♪] [SKIMMING PEBBLES] What's up? Right, one sec. So how did you rediscover this place? Eh? Like how did you know we could get in? Ahh - Interesting story. Friend of mine-- Dan. Well, I say friend but he might be a little fucked off with me now - Anyway - He does this thing where he, like - breaks into places and - photographs old derelict buildings and stuff. Urb-exing they call it. Kinda bizarre hobby but that's modern art for you. So full of anger and destruction - - fuck the government! OK? Anyway - Fountainhead's been on his list for ages - because of the old oil plant. He wanted to be the first one to get in there - just to prove a point! And that's art? Yeah! Really? Well what else? I get what you're saying but - surely the artistic merit is supposed to be in - exposing a world shut off from society. This is why we're here. Not to fuck the government? Well yeah, that. And also 'cause we're-- reclaiming old territory! This place was ours and they fucking took it! SHANNON: Hey. MIKE: Ahh! SHANNON: Mind if I join you guys? Shannon, we were just talking about you. Really? Yeah -- We like youre flower. Gives you that seemingly - innocent appearance - that a nun might have. Or an angel. You're making me self-concious now. [LAUGHTER] But yeah, why fucking close it all this time? I guess the council have to be cautious? But that's like saying we can't think for ourselves. See Shannon here, is a human being - very much in control of herself. But she's grown up - over-protected by a society that want her to live this sheltered life. But in reality - throw a little life experience her way - allow her to live a little - and bang! She's capable of making her own decisions. She probably wouldn't even fucking be here! Oh my God, I know what you mean. Maybe you guys should find your own artistic way of expressing yourselves. But this is it! Now! This party is our expression! [DISTANT CHEERS] [LAUGHTER] Put me down, put me down! Stop being so funny, get off! Put me down! MIKE: Come on Shannon! Fancy sticking your finger up the council's arse? Smile. I bet I look good in that one. Do you not wanna go in? I can't. You're not scared of the water too are you? No. How about you? Did you not want to get your camera wet? Yeah, not really waterproof. I got one of those disposable ones when I was in Australia. You know the ones you can take underwater? Yeah. It was pretty good. Took it when we went scuba diving and stuff. The photo's of the fish were amazing all the different colours and everything. It's the only photography that I've ever really done that I've been - passionate about. I can see the appeal. It's nice to look back at them photos. Yeah I bet. You must have loads? Yeah, too many. I normally shoot on a film camera-- recently been trying to develop them myself. It's fun, but, you know, like you said - the fun's really being able to look back at them. You know, like memories and stuff. So did you never go diving here? No actually. You? No. It would have been nice to see the fish. I wonder what you'd see in there now. Sad about that little kid wasn't it? Did you know him? I never understood how anyone could get lost out there. [LAUGHTER] You looking forward to it? I dunno-- it's all happening so fast. Trust me-- I'd love to do university if I could. Really? I wouldn't have had you down for that! Come on Abby? You not sensing my erm-- intellect here? [GIGGLES] Nah, I'm too intense for uni. Ah, that you definitely are. Urgh - Can you-- can you smell fish? Guys, what the fuck is that smell? That's disgusting! I'm getting out! Oh my god, what is this? [WIND] [LOUD DANCE MUSIC FROM STEREO] [FIRE CRACKLING] [LAUGHTER] Have you not her warble? Shut up! So you sing...? ...Classical. What, like Beethoven? I sing songs with lyrics. REECE: The funny thing about people is how easily they transform through expectation. When you take pictures, you notice. You can look back at your friends - and remember how cool they were before they got contaminated. But that's nature. MATT: Reece! You cheered up now? What the fuck are you wearing? Does it look big on me? Isn't big but it's a style. Whose is it? Mike's. Thought so. Well I feel metrosexual. Oh really? Well he gets girls though. Thanks. You should go for Kayleigh. Why? Well the girls like you, they just don't think you like them. Well I don't, not in that way. Look, you're too fussy. Honestly! People are interested. Maybe, but, they're interests aren't-- Stop worrying, you worry too much mate. Honestly. Look, you need something a bit harder than that. Come on, you're about as tight as your mum's vag. [DIRTY DUBSTEP] [DIRTY DUBSTEP] [CAMERA] [CRACKLING FIRE] [DANCE MUSIC FROM SPEAKERS] MATT: Do you remember that old bus driver we had? The really creepy guy? SHANNON: Yeah. MATT: Hang on - when was the last time we caught the bus? SHANNON: I know. Seems ages. MATT: And you had your idiot friends! SHANNON: Who you always took the piss out of. MATT: Course! SHANNON: And we used to throw gum in their hair - when they sat in front. Yeah that's right. Oh my God, look. [LAUGHTER] Mike! [FOOTSTEPS] Shit - wait! Charlotte's in there! [LAUGHS] Reece Buckmaster! Yeah? You know what that sounds like? Yeah, yeah. You don't need to say. No. NO! I can't stop until you shout. No. Ow! Mercy! [LAUGHS] Mercy. [BRANCH CRACKS] Reece? Reece- can - can I ask you a personal question? OK? You can be totally honest with me. Do you - - kind of - - fancy Charlotte? What? No! That's Matt's girlfriend! Why would that matter? But, that would be really fucked up - Imagine the complications. It wouldn't stop him if it was the other way round. Come with me a minute. Help me find some dock leaves. Why what for? My legs are stinging. That'll help won't it? Yeah, it should help. Come on. But since he's such a 'man whore'- have you ever tried sleeping with him? Who Matt? Mmm. Guys have a lot to offer you know? More than girls - and when they're done they just - move on. Girls are just so - so damn bitchy. SHANNON: Oww that's too hard. How do you know? Fuck you. Ooh! Fuck you! Did you want me to kiss it better? Yeah, you're shit with your hands. Ooh hostile! Do you want to know a secret? What's that? OK - you have to promise you can't tell Reece this. OK? When I was little - you were like - my first crush. Really? No. [LAUGHS] [CLASSICAL MUSIC FROM STEREO] MIKE: Ladies and gentlemen! I'm delighted to announce that I have a very special treat for you all this evening. No, I'm not gonna take my clothes off- Nothing that special. You're about to be treated to some top quality tunes- Hey, where did you go? Abby's gonna sing. Come watch. MIKE: Allow me to introduce to you beautiful people- the lovely- Abigail! OK, one sec. [♪♪] Hey! Have you seen my sister? Which one's your sister? JO: Reece! Kayleigh wants a kiss! [GIGGLES] Right, OK, help me first. I think she went in the woods with Matt. ♪ A wave ♪ of emotion ♪ weave through my mind Feeling better? ♪ Wooahh ♪ Ahhh ♪ Oooh ♪ Aaah REECE: If there's anything I might learn from going back it's that change is inevitable. Watching the virus of exectation- slowly spread and poison those around you. It's so ridiculous it's almost entertaining. [TENT ZIP] ♪ A wave ♪ of emotion ♪ weave ♪ through my mind [YELPS] Ouch. ♪ A wave ♪ of emotion ♪ weave ♪ through my mind [♪♪] [HOWLING WIND] [BRANCH CRACKS] [WALKIE TALKIE CRACKLE] [FOOTSTEPS] MIKE: Thank you Ladies and Gentlemen- Do you have anything to say Abby? Thank you for all your support and goodnight! There you are. Thank you ladies and gentlemen- Signs of a true star in the making! Short and sweet. [♪♪] [WATER LAPPING] [COLD WIND] [SNORES] [SNORES] [VOMITS] [COUGHS] Other people's ignorance is OK. Until it becomes personal. Then you realise there's something wrong. Either with you, or with them. When you start to notice cracks like that, they become increasingly hard to ignore. You can try your best to cover them up- but in reality they still exist. There's no mending it. [LOW DRONE BUILDS] [HEAVY BREATHING THROUGH MASK] [TENT ZIP] [SCREAM] Who was that? Listen. [DISTANT CRYING] What's up? She OK? No. She keeps making these really weird noises- and she's been throwing up for ages- and then she screamed and now she's not moving. Jo? Jo, are you OK? Oh my God, what's the matter with you babe? Has she taken anything? Paracetamol, but - she just keeps throwing it up! No I mean last night, what did she take? Nothing unusual. [JO COUGHING] She needs to get home. Where's Mike? [SNORES] Mike? Mike! Are you awake? Shh, Charlie. God - You look dreadful Abby. I'm fucked. Is Mike in there? It's one of the girls - Kayleigh, Jo, one of them - got themselves into a right old state. [HOWLING WIND] So you two didn't...? When did you start feeling like this? He's not coming, he's fucked. What? But it's his responsibility! He said ask Gav. [LAPPING WATER] [LAPPING WATER] Shan, we're heading off - I need your help packing! I thought you weren't feeling well? I'm not. ABBY: It's fine Charlie, I'll wash it. Don't be silly! You need to rest. What are you gonna do with it? Rinse it in the river? The river's dirty Charlie, just - leave it, don't worry. Do you need a hand? Er, no. We'll meet you down at the beach. Yeah OK. Shan? It's fine, I can wait. See you in a bit. [CRYING] Where the fuck is she? She said she was getting help! [BLOW DART FIRES] [THUD] [SCREAMS]What the fuck?? [CRIES] Let's go. Let's go! Half a pill - that's all I had, plus a few drinks! I believe you. So why you walking off? Because I'm concerned! Chill out, they're just fucking lightweights! Shut up! Fuck! Seriously what the fuck! They've fucking gone without us the fucking pricks! It's alright, they'll come back. I know! But I sorted that out and Abby should be on there! Charlie, it's alright You tried. They've gone without us Reece. We have to wait. [LAPPING WATER] MIKE: It's just a come down. ABBY: I feel like shit. It could be food poisoning. Maybe. Because if Gav had it too? What did everyone eat? I didn't eat yesterday. REECE: You didn't eat yesterday? SHANNON: No I'm on a diet. Well you still have to eat if you're on a diet. I thought they had stuff for the squits? Immodium? That stuff's lethal. He's probably trying to call. Yeah helpful right now. You didn't drink anything milky y'know, like White Russians? Two beers. We got any left? Can we check the dates? They were bought yesterday. Where? Look I'm only trying to help! Well I feel like I'm on trial! You're the one that brought everything! Like the pills. Oh for fuck's - We all brought shit! Why does it seem like such a ridiculous suggestion to you? I mean I'm not having a go but it does make perfect sense. 'Cos - Charlotte's fine- Matt's fine- Reece is fine. Well Reece obviously didn't take his- Reece! I did. I was there Abby. Well maybe only some of them were bad! Slim chance. Well did anyone not take one? CHARLOTTE: Anything? MIKE: No. I can remember the way out inland. What the bike route? Yeah. But it could be a bit tricky. ABBY: Compared to sailing under a fence? Well I'm pretty sure it's all blocked off. Well, if we can get near a road- we might be able to get some signal- at least then we can find out where they went? MIKE: Yeah, tell Gav he's a - Hang on, what we talking about here? Aiming towards the oil plant. What that place? It's our only option. Are you fucking kidding me? What? We have to fucking walk? Well how far is it? About a mile. Well are there any footpaths? What for all the people that come down here? I assume there's some a bit closer. Well what about once we get there? There's a road. Someone could pick us up right? ABBY: So we just leave everything? It's not gonna get stolen. I swear to God, if it rains and my kit gets fucked- I'll rip his fucking head off- and shit down his neck! ABBY: Alright, let me get my bag! [♪♪] [VOMITS] [COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING] [ABBY VOMITING IN BACKGROUND] REECE: Did anyone bring water? Maybe Abby. [ABBY COUGHING] Abby is this yours? ABBY: [CROAKY] There should be a new one in there somewhere. [ABBY COUGHING] [SIGHS] Which way? North. We need to head that way. How do you know? Well, the sun's west so... Genius. Not really. Charlie? I just need five minutes. You guys go. We'll catch up. We don't know where to go. Well Mike knows. We'll stay, it's fine Charlotte. [BIKE WHEEL CLICKING] MIKE: This is gonna be a long trip. You should go see her. Abby? ABBY: Don't come over here! OK. I'm just here. [SOBBING] What's up Abby? Come here. Don't cry. Oh, Abby. [CRYING] Abby? Abby what's up? What's the matter? I've got something wrong with me. What the fuck are they doing? I don't know, probably- chatting. Doing their make up- shaving their fannies! [SNIGGERS] [COUGHS] Did you take anything last night? Honestly? MIKE: Before you make any assumptions- no! Let's just get her water. It really hurts. [YELPS] What do you think it is? MATT: What the fuck? Not a good time Matt! Ooh. Yeah, I can see that! How long have you had it? I don't know - it's been hurting a while but I only just looked. What so it was hurting before? Kind of. It was - it was stinging in the night. Well, do you think something bit you? Well, I thought about it - but I'm sure I'd notice something like that. You know, it's like it came out of nowhere! [YELPS] I couldn't get near, they were all like - touching each other! What? MIKE: Lesbians. But I got it. What the fuck's your problem? [♪♪] [RADIO CRACKLE] [RADIO CRACKLE] [DISTANT BIRD CRY] [♪♪] How you feeling? Fine. Shit. You need a drink? Cigarette's fine. [WHISPERS] Shan? You OK? We can go over there? OK. Do you wanna...? How bad is it? It's not too bad. It probably looks worse than it is. Oh my God! Oh God, what is that? You have an infection. Shit it looks bad. Don't panic. When did it start? Last night? Like at what point? REECE: Shan? I can smell that smell again. [SNIFFS] What is it? Oh right, you weren't there. When we were in the water it fucking reeked. How comes you didn't go in? Hate water. Really? I never would've imagined that. Just creeps me out a little bit. [SNORTS] Man up, you're a bouncer! Does it hurt? CHARLOTTE: Here? Right OK. Right, look at me Shannon. Shannon - I'm gonna clean it for you. It might sting a little bit. What? [SUCTION / SLURPS] [SHANNON YELPS] What the fuck was that?! What did you do? What did you-- Charlotte, what the fuck? Charlotte that's not normal! Shan. [SOBBING] [PANTING] [BLUSTERY WIND] We need to get to a hospital now Mike. OK...? Is Shannon...? What's going on? I think there's something - alive, under Shannon's skin. Fuck! Serious? Like what? I don't know. Mike - have you not noticed anything weird with you? It's not quite right is it? What the fishy smell? No, I was talking about your, erm - thing. Jesus! Can we just fucking get away from this shit! Yeah I literally can't take it anymore. Matt, I wouldn't touch those! They're probably meant to be stored somewhere. This is actually really bad. This place is such a shit hole! [MIKE COUGHS AND VOMITS] Abby... Have you even seen any fish since we got here? I don't know. Weird. Seems like - detergents or something. Do you think this stuff gets used? What would they use it for? Oh, dispersants. That's the word I was looking for. Used to, erm - break down unwanted compounds like an oil spill or something. Do you reckon there was a spill? If there was ever a spill in Huxley Wells we'd hear about it! Would we though? REECE: The oil plant just beyond Fountainhead Creek was shut down not long after Will Carter's disappearance. I remember my parents knowing a guy who worked there at the time. He told us once that a spill would take years to clean up. That it would impregnate the beaches. ABBY: Charlie I'm scared. Do you think it could be anything to do with that- shit in the barrel? Do you think they could be harmful? I don't know, I just don't want to end up with my - fucking skin all messed up. REECE: She's done. Let's get going. [GASPS] Abby? [STRUGGLES] She's choking! Water, someone! Where? Where is it? In her bag! [GASPS] [GAGS] [SCREAMS] [SUCTION / SLURPS] CHARLOTTE: Look Abby. You're alright! ABBY: [SOBBING] Charlie I'm scared! It's OK Abby. Look at me! Look at what it's doing to me... [SOBBING] [♪♪] So I was right then? What that this was all my fault? You have it too. Good observation. Aahh! How much does it actually hurt? Aghh - Like a fucking- John Hurt chest burster. [♪♪] Thank you very much. We need to keep moving. I know. Just give them five more minutes. Are you scared? They're relaxed now. You did a good job. What did Shan say when you asked her? She thinks it was the slime. From the water? Everyone who went in there's sick. Do you think it's from the barrels. That's what Abby reckons- but you never know with her if she's over reacting. But Shan was covered in it. MIKE: I got one! Fish puns in films. What the fuck? Like, film titles - but with fish in them. Huh? [LAUGHS] OK 'Plankton menace'. Oh! Wha- Oh I, I get it! Like, like- Star Wars... But, with - Fish! Oh! OK, OK, OK... Let me think of one. OK. OK, I'm thinking... I'm thinking. Erm. 'Anemone of the State'. Hey, hey! That was my go! Matt's gone quiet. It's so weird with him - I can't see it getting any better. You won't tell him that will you? No. You two don't seem as close as you used to be. I guess. You're a lot easier to talk to than he is. [COUGHING] ABBY: What's that film with - with 'God' in the title? Godfather! Yeah...yeah. City of God? Yeah, no. OK. You ready for this guys? OK. The 'Cod' Father! [LAUGHS] Get it? 'Cause of Cod! [SNIGGERS] That was bad. ABBY: Ok - ok! I like it, I like it! [WINCES] [DISTANT FOOTSTEPS] MATT: Hello? [TRICKLING WATER] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] MATT: Heya. What are you doing? I was just...checking my back- from the fence, earlier. What's that illness you can get from rusty metal? Tetanus? Yeah that one. You mean you caught something? ABBY: 'A Fish called Wanda'. [LAUGHS] You can't have that- it's already a film! Hey! Hey... Charlie! Come play! [GIGGLES] we're playing 'Fish Puns - in films'. So far- we've got- 'Scar Plaice' 'Blair Fish Project' 'Donnie Sharko' and 'Prawn Identity'! It's fucking wicked! CHARLOTTE: Right? OK. How about... Sea- Bass-ket ball diaries. [LAUGHTER] [SNORT] You know what Charlie? I fucking love you. You're fucking amazing. You're like... beautiful! Yeah, Charlie - what the fuck would we do without you? ABBY: Our guardian! We need to get going. SHANNON: Wait. Not without Reece. I'll get that boy. How's your breathing? Oh, better! This shit is like medicine. I'm getting worried about you becoming a biologist! [LAUGHTER] SHANNON: Where are you Reece? [RADIO CRACKLE] [BREATHING] [RADIO INTERFERENCE] [RADIO CRACKLE] Reece? Reece? [BREATHING] [LOUD CRACKLE] [SCREAMS!] Shan? Shannon! [ABBY SNIGGERS] If - if Shannon was a fish - it'd be salmon. [SNIGGERS] CHARLOTTE: Reece! Wait up! Where the fuck is she? Shannon! Shannon! REECE: Shan! BOTH: Shannon! You're kidding me. Shan! She was literally with us a second ago. I know. Shan! You don't think she's kidding about? She wouldn't. Unless she was completely off her face. [WATER SPLASHING] [HEAVY BREATHING] [♪♪] This is fucked up. I know. Seriously something weird going on. What do we do? Reece won't move now until we've found her. No. And it's getting dark. Sometimes when I'm nervous I imagine how the Carter family must have felt- back in 2004. What was going through their minds? How could they live not knowing? [WRETCHES] [VOMITS] [COUGING] [SOBBING] What's happening to us? REECE: In most cases- not knowing can be torture. It's human nature to demand reason and logic. But not everything can be answered. Sometimes you just get left in the dark. You guys are gonna have to go aren't you? I think I'm gonna stay. Reece- you know we're gonna have to call the police. Yeah. CHARLOTTE: Come on. Let's go. We don't even know where to go Charlie. I'll come with you. It's fine. Well I'm here! Oh come on, you know Shannon's like a sister to me. What? Fuck off then! I can't Charlie, I can't. You can Abby, you totally can. We're so close now. We don't even know where we're going! If we can find a road, we can find a way. MIKE: [GROANS] Jeez Abby- your slight figure is - deceiving! Oh God- I can't walk! No - Charlie... I can't walk - What the fuck! CHARLOTTE: Don't panic! ABBY: I can't walk! So what, you can't put weight on your legs..? OK, let me-- Put me down! Put me- Oh what the fuck is happening?! I don't know! They feel like they're locked together! [LOW RUMBLE] [LISTENING DEVICE] CHARLOTTE: It's OK Abby... We can do it together. [RADIO INTERFERENCE] [♪♪] [COUGHING] Don't. It's the only place we haven't checked yet. I know. But she's sick, you're not. You can't get sick! If you get sick, then, well- we're all - fucked. What do you mean? Must have caught it from someone. What are you doing? Like you said - it's the last place we have to look. Matt! You're fucking insane! Thank me later. Can you even swim? [SPLASHES] [♪♪] [STRUGGLES AND COUGHING] [VEHICLE APPROACHES] Hey! Hey!!! Help us! Help us! [GUN LOAD] [RADIO CRACKLES] [SCARED BREATHING] [DART FIRES] [SCREAMS] [DARTS FIRE AGAIN] Anything? I can't see, it's fucking dark. Oh shit. I'll keep trying - I'm basically just feeling my way around. What's it like? It's fucking dense man - I'm just trying not to get this shit in my mouth! Fuck my eyes are stinging. Right, you should come out. Hang on, shine it here a second! Matt? [WHINING] Fuck! Matt don't do that! FUCK!! [SCREAMING] AHH! AHH! AHH! Matt come on over! I can't fucking see! [SCREAMS] I can't fucking see! Shit. Police! We could be alright! MATT: Reece! Reece! [HEAVY BREATHING] [RADIO CRACKLES] REECE: Hey! [DARTS FIRED] [SPLASH] [DART FIRES] [SCREAMS] [CRASHES] [♪♪] [HEAVY BREATHING] [DOOR SLAMS] [FEMALE SOBBING] Shan? It's me. Charlotte? Charlotte, what the fuck's happening? I don't know. Why am I tied down? Charlotte, why the fuck am I tied down? Are the others here? [STRUGGLING] [PANTING] Who's doing this? I thought they were the police. I saw one of them before. Where? Last night - when I went to go and try and find... There was some fucking guy in a mask! Gas masks? Yeah! What the fuck's that all about? You certain it was them? I, I.... I thought it was someone pissing around at the start but-- You don't think it's Gav and that lot? We were attacked! If that's someone's idea of a joke- they can fucking die in a field! [GROANS] We must be in some serious shit! Why the fuck were they dressed like that? You don't think Abby was right? What do you mean? About the chemicals- their infection looked pretty serious. Shit. What's up? I think I can get out! Really? I just got my right hand out! Oh fu - How long have you been down here? [CLATTERS AROUND] I can't reach anything. Try undo some more! [PULLING OFF RESTRAINTS] [BOAT ENGINE] [RADIO INTERFERENCE] That's it! Shit, amazing keep going! Well done! [CRASHES TO FLOOR] Charlotte? I'm OK. Just a bit dizzy. Be careful! And be so fucking quiet! I'm gonna untie you now. No, no Charlotte - try and find something first - something to defend yourself - a bar or something. I can't Reece, I wouldn't be able to! I need some scissors or something. Just- keep looking, just try to find something - don't waste time, try- try and find a light or something. [CHARLOTTE STUMBLES] Are you OK? Reece! I think this is your camera bag! How do you turn it on? On the top twist it! Oh cool - I can sort of see you now. Right, use the flash - use the flash. [CAMERA SNAPS] I think we're in the plant. Shit. [CAMERA SNAPS] [BOAT ENGINE] [RADIO INTERFERENCE] [CAMERA SNAPS] There's a corridor. I'm gonna go find something to get you out. Thank you. Don't thank me yet. I know - I just can't believe you got out! Charlotte? Are you gonna be OK? You're the first person to ask me that this weekend. [FOOTSTEPS LEAVE ROOM] [DRIPPING WATER] [HEAVY DOOR OPENS] [HUM OF MACHINERY] [GASPS] [DRONE] [UNDERWATER] [UNDERWATER MOVEMENT] [CAMERA SNAPS] [FUMBLING IN THE DARK] [POWERS UP LIGHTS] [ELECTRICAL HUM] Oh my God. Oh my God. [GASPS] [♪♪] Abby? Abby! [♪♪] REECE: Matt will never know how lucky he is- to have a girl like Charlotte Menary. Maybe she won't know it either. [BUBBLES] I lie here - convincing myself that she's gonna come back any second. She'll find Shannon - she'll rescue her friends - and then she'll free me. [BUBBLES] Then we throw those broken pieces away- leave them here to sink at Fountainhead Creek. We disappear- and never come back. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] [SCHOOL BELL] [PENCIL CASE HITS FLOOR] [♪♪] [CHILDREN LAUGHING] Because where there's a way in, there's still a way out. The only escape if you're lucky. [♪♪]
