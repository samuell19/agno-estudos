Korean Film Song of Retrospection April Spring Friendship Art Festival Aren't you Mr. Komak? -Are you coming alone? -Yes. Let's take into the car, please. Thank you. Get in, please. Thank you. It's a very fine season! Your country is similar to mine in temperature. Is it so? Let's go in, please. Thank you. Here we gather in sunny Pyongyang Holding the friendly hands with one another Let's sing altogether Singing the song of friendship Singing the song of solidarity Following the way of independence Let's go energetically Vice president, singing has improved a lot. Yes, but as it is a programme for the joint assembly of the festival you should go on practicing. Yes. Oh, what's brought him here? Your country has made tremendous changes. How surprising to see such changes in less than 30 years. Have you ever been to our country? Yes, in the midst of the Korean war, I came here as a war composer to write sonata about the victory of UN forces. Really? Pyongyang at that time was literally in a complete ruin. But today it's change is a miracle. I am going to sing the victory of the Korean people in this melody. Yes. May I have a look at it, please? Don't misunderstand me. I am not an expert. -Yes, please have a look. -Thank you. When did you start this melody? I wrote it 30 years ago, but I did not compose it. Why? There's something with it. The owner of this piece is a Korean naval radio operator. A naval radio operator? I modeled on her song and completed this concerto. Before presenting it in the festival, I felt anxious to hear some opinions from Ra Sol Ju, a naval radio operator who composed it. It is really impressive. By the way where is she now? I don't know. But anyway I want so much to hear her opinions before presenting it in festival performance. I see. It's morality among the artists and I have some reasons myself. We'll try our best to find her. Couldn't you tell me anything more helpful to find her? Thank you. I shall be obliged if you do so. She is my unforgettable friend who taught me what a beautiful and noble music is and the real conscience of an artist. Follow me. Lay down. Hands up! Come out. Comrade Yong Hui! Take weapons away from them. Yes. I haven't any arms. I'm not armed. A man without weapon, does it make sense? He is from our allied nation and... Stop! Comrade Yong Hui. Take them down. Yes. Battalion commander, armored trucks are coming to the communication squad. What? Comrade Yong Hui. Shoot them immediately if they try to run away. Yes. What did she say just before? She said to kill us immediately if we try to run away. Don't speak. Comrades, stand up. Get grenades ready! Throw! This way! -lsn't it painful? -Not much. Comrades. Our commander is coming. Well done, comrades. Well done. -Any casualties? -No one, sir. Excellent, comrades! Comrade Sol Ju. Your communication squad is also a model in a battle. Lieutenant! Tell that officer that I am a member of consolatory group of UN forces. Don't be silly. They would kill you. I am not a soldier. I am a civilian who has come to write the sonata about the war. Do you think they know what a sonata is? Didn't you see an American officer's death before our eyes. Stand up! Your certificates. Quick. Are you a TI and E personnel? Yes. Your's. Your ID card. I have no ID card. I am a civilian. He's saying he's a civilian. American? No, from allied nations. Why are you in Korea although you are not an American or a serviceman? What did he say? Tell the purpose of your visit. I'm, in fact, a historian, you know. Studying specially about the war history of the East. He's a historian, specially about the war history of the East. War history of the East? Indeed there is a need for people in your allied nations to know how Americans' noses are put out of joint by Korean people. lsn't it, TI & E personnel? They are real heroines. It's great that 5 girls fought against the unit of armored vehicles to defend their position to the end. Right. The leader of that communication squad captured an armord truck of the enemy. -Who's that? -Her name is Ra Sol Ju. Her father died in the battle of the river Rakdong, and before she joined the army, she studied at musical university We appointed her as a radio operator as she is quite good at English. Is that so? So there is an opinion about sending her to the meeting of model combatants organized by supreme headquarters. We have a female musician soldier as a model combatant. Nice! I'm sorry that I have to leave the battalion without celebrating the holiday together. So we are. We were preparing hard to celebrate the holiday of April 15th in frontline. Go to the brigade as soon as possible and hand over the prisoner. And enjoy the holiday well there. Battalion commander! Ra Sol Ju is leaving as you ordered. Stop there. Sit down. Don't look here. Well, do you want to eat? I am hungry. Forget it. Though they are full, they will throw away it, never give us. Komak Let's try to take it by ourselves. Turn back! We'll just have a light meal before going on. Hey, take one. Komak, let's lie that we need to relieve ourselves after eating the bread. Will she let us? Maybe she'll let us go one by one. Moreover she won't let us go freely. At least she'll tell us to sound like cuckoo as we walk. What shall l do? I'll go first and you take the chance to run to the opposite. Er-r-r Why? Can I go to a private place and... Yes, but in turns. Just a moment. Shout "one, two", "one, two" as you walk. Are you making fool of an military officer? Think as you like. As soon as the sound stops I'll think you're running away and fire all the bullets. OK. One Two One Two One Two One Why don't you run away? Why are you surprised? Perhaps he may be irritated waiting for you. He was going to escape taking a chance that I follow you But you can't do it. What an idiot! Let's go. Why didn't you do as I said? Hush! She knows English. Leave! Speed up! What did she say? If we take off this path there is a road. Jump down to the valley. Quick! Stop there. Stop! The bridge's broken. Let's give the way to the cart with shells. Yes. Lie down! Lie down! Hurry up! Lie down! You want to kill yourself? I don't care to be killed in any way. Who said you would be killed? You want to kill yourself in bombardment of the Yankees in the foreign country far way from your motherland, leaving behind your parents and brothers? Comrade Yong Il. Thank you. Hurry. Yong Il. Yong Il Come round. Thank you, marine. I am a company commander of engineering. You have done a fine job. It's our duty. This was the second time in today. Where are you going? I am going to the brigade headquarters with a foreign civilian. Foreigner? Well, comrade. Please wait here for a moment. What's the matter? As soon as we finish rebuilding that bridge, we'll let you go first. Thanks. -Hey, let's go. -Yes, sir. Today I can understand you very well. So what do you think of me? I'm sure no one can escape from you and no one can trick you. You're a tough girl, indeed. We've grown tough and terrible. All of us, women and children are strong before the enemies. You saw just before the bombardment of the Yankees to those two carts of the ordinary people. -Hurry up. -Yes, sir. All ready? We're doing the last work. As the comrades want, you drop at our company until the bridge is ready. Your company? You know what today is. Yes, of course. I've also thought a lot alone, walking along the river from this morning. If it wasn't for a war, we would have a concert at the university. That's the point. Though we have a war, we can't pass today normally. So we organized simple frontline concerts and prepared something. What do you think? You'd better enjoy with us only for a while instead of commemorating the day alone. Thank you very much. Comrades! A seagull has come to our company. Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you. You're very welcome. We've heard you are a foreign civilian. Sit comfortably there. Sit down there. Comrades! We've never fought a war before. We were living in different places, with different dreams but we've formed a harmonious company and fought even several times a day risking our lives. We all have our painful troubles. Among us are only sons who have left old mothers alone and a soldier worrying about his young brother left in the next door. But nobody talks about it. What's the source of their strength? The conviction of sure victory. Because we have our General as the Supreme Commander. Comrades! Cheers! Bless good health of the respected Supreme Commander. Cheers! Skirt being torn out by path bush She's running home dancing Throwing away the hoe Nobody knows why she's running Drown into the stream crossing the small bridge but she keeps on running home Is it a holiday of the army? It's the birthday of our respected Supreme Commander Kim Il Sung Songs and laughter! It can be heard only among the people who are sure to win the war. Then do they really think they can defeat the USA, such strong? What do they believe in? What's the source of their strength? The letter from the frontline Nobody knows she got it Comrades! We have made a serious mistake. "Navy congratulatory group" is here in this concert. Right! They want you to sing a song. You can't avoid it. Please! I won't forget, even after a long time, you comrades that l met in the frontline. To see you laughing in such fierce battles I can remember the lyrics that my father sent me with his last letter. This is the song I've composed with that lyrics at leisure. Who taught me What is more precious than youth Kind eyes of mother who saw me off Told me it's the fatherland Who taught me What is more precious than life A tree burning in a battle site Told me it's the fatherland You made much efforts, comrade Sol Ju. I'm sorry that you have to leave now without a rest to attend a model combatant meeting. Never mind. The chief of staff, I will leave immediately as you ordered. -Take care of yourself. -Thank you. Sol Ju, he seems to be very uneasy. Tell him something before you leave. Shall we go out? Are you leaving? Are you going? Yes, I am. You'll return to your country under the international law as you wish. Yes? Is it true? Yes, our headquarters will soon send you to Pyongyang. Thanks a lot. I have been so far in deceiving you. In fact, I'm not a historian but a composer I came to the frontline to write "Sonata" about the victory of the UN forces. In the West, when the war broke out they said it would soon end with the victory of America. Now what do you think of it? Once again, I think about the war and destiny of humanity. Specially you, about the Korean people, about your own fate. Forgive me. You also lost your father due to this war. We all have similar grievances. But we're overcoming them for something more important. I can not understand you. Is there anything more precious than yourself and your family? It's motherland. We have never thought of our own fate apart from the motherland. Since our respected Supreme Commander Kim Il Sung restored our fatherland, our family could have led a happy life. I had a very precious experience not as a composer, as a human being here in Korea. And I'll leave with an unforgettable memory. Finally I have one thing to ask you. What is it? Will you write that song for me? I'm sorry, but it's not completed yet. When the war is over and I complete it, I'll send it with pleasure. Well, good luck. Saying good-bye I worried about her future and the country's calamities. Wishing them good luck... I prayed in my mind. Didn't you see her later? Yes, I did. It was really unexpected. When? In Berlin, the summer of the year. -In Berlin? -Yes. It was so much exicted. As she told, I went back home safely one week later. I felt myself like a returning general of triumphant. They all thought it as a miracle that I returned after being captured in Korea. Why? In those days people didn't know correctly about Korea. So I was regarded as being blessed. In that summer there was a large international festival in the capital of German Democratic Republic. You mean the 3rd Youth and Students Festival? Yes. Oh! Then Ra Sol Ju took part in that festival, didn't she? I've never dreamt of that. Such a foreign country, far away from fighting Korea. As the Korean delegates entered the stadium at the opening ceremony 100 thousands of people stood up to cheer. Their land and population is small. But what encouraged them in such military uniform to come to far-off Europe to sing a song? Oh, Komak? Nice to see you. I came here as a tourist. Is that so? Nice to see you. I got so much excited to see you at the opening day. And you had a wonderful performance. Where is Ra Sol Ju? She went to the International Seminar. I see. Send her my regard. Even on flight to Berlin, I've never dreamt that I could meet you here again. Very glad. -I'll visit your hotel tomorrow. -Yes, please. Hurry. Good bye. Where is Ra Sol Ju? Upstairs. Ra Sol Ju! Oh, Komak! I heard you met our comrades yesterday. -Thank you. -You're leaving so early? Sol Ju. -Hurry. -Yes. As you saw our country is overcoming the hardship. So we should go to the front line. I understand you. However, if you return to the front, will you be safe? Komak If we had ever thought we would be defeated in the war then we couldn't have been able to bring these songs in this festival. Our respected Supreme Commander told us that we should go to Berlin to convince the progressive world people that Korea is sure to win the US imperialism. Your Supreme Commander? Yes... Please, forgive me. I thought wrongly the noble world of music. I intended to write the song of UN force's victory which invades your honest nation. I tore the sonata into pieces in my mind. Thank you, Mr. Komak! We will always regard you as our friend. It's the musical note you asked. Take it as my gift. Thanks. I'll remember you for ever. The more I listen to the song, the more I want to think. Maybe because of its background? Of course! I've never forgotten Ra Sol Ju for 30 years with this song. By the way, what about going for a walk until the concert starts? -Very good. -Please. Perhaps, if Ra Sol Ju is alive, she may be working as a musician. Yes, I think so. One year after she had left Berlin, I heard a very bad news. The situation grew quite tense as the US started the New Offensive. Press of the West said that Korea was in a firestorm, The heights of the hills were lowered over 10 meters. It's a miracle if she is alive till now. But I want to believe that miracle. Any clue there? At that time, I met a journalist returned from the Korean war, I was told that your Supreme Commander ordered to open the Servicemen's Art Festival. Then I realised that the Korean people were not threatened by the New Offensive, and the victory was already Koreans'. As I expected, in July next year the delightful news shaked the world. The Victory of Korea! From that time, I started to make a piano concerto about the victory of the Korean people with her song. This is the reason why I want to listen to her opinion. Hearing your story, I also want to see her once. I will do my best to make your desire come true. Thank you. Dear guide! -A guest left this message for you. -Thank you. Dear guide, I'm writing this as I heard you're guiding Komak. I know him well since the war. Hello. This is Koryo Hotel. I want to speak to Ri Young Hui. Sorry. Our deputy art director has gone to the joint performance rehearsal. I'm an art instructor here. How can I help you? I'm a guide for the April Spring Friendship Art Festival. I've just received a message from Vice President. So... Ah... She went there to see a man called Komak. She will come back at about 6 o'clock. Call later. Oh, to my regret... It's the time for friendship evening party. Okay. I'll certainly try to call that time. Good bye. Hello, Komak. Why don't you dance? Watching them is also interesting. Let me guess what you're thinking now. You're thinking of somebody you can share the memories on this joyful day, aren't you? Never mind. She will soon appear in front of you. Is that true? I've just phoned to a person who fought together with Ra Sol Ju during the war. Really? After returning from the Berlin festival, they took part in the performance of the Servicemen. Your guess was right. Well, then... she survived in that severe war? Yes, she is. She wants to see you tomorrow. Then I can finally see her. Thank you very much. Oh, she's there. Mr. Komak. You, wearing navy uniform! You're right. Very nice to see you. Oh, When did you learn our language? Well, a little... It's really nice to see you again in our country Me too. Please let's go in. Yes, please. -Please sit down. -Thank you. Nothing changed and you still look young for your age. What do you do now? I work as a deputy director in a theatre. Good. What about you? I work as a professor in a musical university. Have you given up history? Oh, you've got a good memory. Well, in Berlin that time, did you receive the musical note from our squad leader? Yes, I did. I have been keeping that note till now. Here. So what happend to Ra Sol Ju afterward? I think the story would be long. I'm afraid if l should have too much time of you. No, it's OK. Time is no matter for your story. Since I got a visa card for your country, I was so excited to see you and covered the half way around the world at once. I understand you. So, did you bring her song with you to the art festival of the servicemen? Yes, but she couldn't come. We brought her song, but she couldn't come with us. What was the problem? It was the day that we were coming for that art festival. Who taught me What's more precious than youth Kind eyes of mother seeing me off Told me it's motherland. Who taught me What's more precious than life One tree burning at the frontline Told me it's fatherland. O, mother, my motherland It will be forever with the General Let's stop practising and speed up. Squad leader, can we arrive at Pyongyang today? The brigade headquarters will inform us. It will be really great if all the branches of army gather together. But how were we to perform on the very first day though we are farthest away? It's nautal, Ok Ju. Your song is well known even in Berlin. Sqaud leader, I wish our way to the festival were opened to the parade of war victory. Wonderful! The day is not far. Hurry up. What can we do in the daylight? Because of the warship of the communist army... No other choice. Ambush here until it becomes dark. I'll shoot anyone who moves. Listen, all of you. We must explode two train tunnels leading to the frontline by tonight. Understood? Got it. Good! Catch them alive without a noise. Yes, sir. To arms! Yong Suk! Squad leader! Yong Suk! Yong Hui, gun! Go behind a large rock with comrades. Hurry! Yes. They are escaping sideways. Ok Ju! Ok Ju! -Yong Hui. -Oh, Ok Ju... You have to leave first. I'll block them here. Squad leader, let's go together. No, I can't. That only road to the frontline would be dangerous if they escape here. Yong Hui, nobody can replace us, you know. Squad leader! Squad leader, come round! Squad leader! Squad leader! Why are you leaving only me? Squad leader! In the hard-fought battle full of enemies bullets We fought to keep the words in mind Next, female sailor's chorus. "Who taught me?" Performed by comrade Ra Sol Ju and 4 others. But the members of the group died a heroic death in the unexpected battle while crossing the coastline in Talsongri, and therefore can't attain the meeting. They didn't come here, but they asked Ri Yong Hui, the only survivor, to take their songs with her. Who taught me What's more precious than the whole life The bloody flag my comrades handed Told me it's fatherland Even though the rivers and mountains burn to the ashes The soldier's conviction becomes strong How can such a nice person die? She left... Really left... But we've never thought she left us. So many people same as Ra Sol Ju are growing up near us. Yes, you are right. I realised what she devoted her life for. If she were alive and heard my concert, she would have advised that this concert must be the hymn to the great President Kim Il Sung That's right. It's the unanimous desire of our Korean people. Why is it the only desire of the Korean people? It's the desire of the world people including me. I've realized correctly that the victory of the Korean people, the source of the great strength caused the rapid development of Korea is just the great President Kim Il Sung
