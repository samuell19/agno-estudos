- Hmm? - You speak English? - Little. - Ah. Use yours. First thing I buy. Then big bottle of vodka. What you buy first? - Plane ticket for my son, my son. - Aw. Aw. Oh, I get you light. - Fair is fair. - Fuck. Agent Carter, time is 0130. Second asset's down. What moron Shanghai'd my coordinates? Carter out. - Mark. Mark! - What? - We have a problem. - What problem? - Well, two actually. The first is that you didn't come to bed last night. Glad I slept over. The second is I'm melting! - Right, okay. Well I'll fix that right now. Don't worry about it. Yeah, building manager's office. Yeah I need, yeah I'll hold. - And why were you up doing analysis at the wee hours of the morning? - Judge needed clearances. You know, important stuff. Active cases and indictments and things. Yeah, hi, my air conditioning's not working. - You don't even have this set to cool, Mark. - Yeah, that's right. 1006. - Or the fan on. - Yeah, yes I have called a lot of times. - And why would you not just tell him no. - Right now. 'Cause I was just following orders, okay? - No, it's not under my control. Listen, I'm a client and I'll have you know that I. Nevermind, I fixed it. - You fixed it? - Well. Using the proverbial I. But hey, now that we're cooling down, we might as well do something that'll warm us back up. - Oh listen, office boy, I gotta shower. But I'll see you at the office later. - Yeah, sure. Anything for the Federal Service. - All of 15 minute early, Mark? You feeling okay? - 052817, time is 0800. Federal Police Department satellite office number 3122. Special Operation Unit. Meeting led by agent Jarvis. Agenda items - Hey. - Mission Warm Welcome brief. All involved agents and analysts in attendance with no discussion to follow. - As I assume most of you know, last night's mission to safely extract two asylum seekers was unsuccessful. - What? - The coordinates agent Carter received put him well out of reach of the target. - Shit eating, mother rimming little dick slap. - Brandon, at ease. - You botched the coordinates, Mark. - Agent Carter! - Risking my ass for those girls. You had one fucking job, one job. - Control yourself, Carter. - One fucking job. - Agent Carter! - This is on you. You. - If I may continue. We have one additional agenda item this morning. - Look, they shouldn't have fired you. - Who else were they gonna fire, Agent Awesome? Not when he's blaming it all on my intel. - Maybe it was an error. People make mistakes. - Yeah, yeah and, yeah and maybe, you know, maybe it's for the best. Because now we don't have to worry about the rules. We don't have to sneak around anymore. We can honestly be like a normal couple. We are gonna get our own place, right? - Another Coke, sir? - Yeah, sure. - Here, let me buy this round. - Sir. - Henry Caehill. - Mark Miller. Communications, well former Communications Analyst. - Yeah, I know. I read your file. I'm sorry about how your day unfolded. No thanks, I'll have a bourbon. - I'm starting to think I really wasn't cut out for any of this. You know? - You didn't kill the witnesses, Mark. - Witnesses? - The intel you gave Agent Carter was right on the money. - How do you know? - I'm with the National Defense. I know your former employers have a leak. I just don't know who. - A leak? - More of a hemorrhage, actually. - Jesus. - I need your help. - I don't know sir, you're not exactly catching me at my best. - Mark! In this line of business there's only one currency. It's not money, it's not power. It's sure as shit not respect. It's trust. Trust is the only thing that matters. Call me crazy. But I think I can trust you. What I'm about to tell you is highly classified. There's a boatload of Georgian witnesses on their way. These people know important information. They need a clear passage and a safe place to stay. Our job is to keep them safe until they can testify in front of the ICC. Unfortunately our track record on this is pretty shit awful. Every time we get them in, someone leaks their location and they're killed. - And you need me to find the leak. - No, I need you build a house. These are the preliminary plans for an off book safe house. The building has been purchased and it's ready to renovate. It doesn't have to look like a hotel, Mark, it just needs to be structurally sound. The budget is strictly limited. Every transaction will be cash. I won't lie to you, Mark, it's gonna be near impossible to get this thing done. The land title will be in your name. The organization will disallow any knowledge of the project. You get it built. - Sir, I'm honored, but there's no way. - Look, Mark. Do exactly as you're told. Nothing more, nothing less. And I will guarantee you that you will be reinstated. - Can I think about it? - Son, there's an ancient Chinese proverb you may have heard of. - What's that? - Never fuck a gift horse in the mouth. This is untraceable. Call me with your answer. Do you smoke cigars? - No. - You should start. - Caehill, I'm in. Hi there. - Wow. - This is. - Hazards. Definitely hazards. - So why don't you just come over here and we can talk about the project a little bit more. Why don't ya have a seat. - If we can find a safe spot. - I started with plumbing. Got sick and tired of the poop. - Right. - Bro, I've done 'em all. Big ones, small jobs. - My knees is gone, my back is gone. - Well I wouldn't go that far, sir. It's just that this project's gonna need some extra attention. - You ever seen a man in impaled by an I-beam? - Bro, I do it all. - In your professional opinion what would the price be? - This is a lot of money. - Men could die. - You know I only have . - How much? - For the whole job? - Are you fucking kidding me? - Would you be willing to consider a bit of a discount? - No. Bro no. - Not gonna happen. - It just needs some new framing and some new electrical. Okay, I realize that. Yeah. - Are you trying to fill out lungs with bloody lesion? Seriously, asbestos? This looks fucking-- - Nothing, no, everything's fine. I just have to. - Could be horse hair or twine, but if it's asbestos I won't touch it. I don't touch that shit. - I'm gonna have to call you back. Excuse me, who are you? Hello? Hello? - Quite the structural mess you got here. - This is private property. It's owned. - Isn't all property owned? - Who are you and why are you here? - I'm Zoe, I'm a contractor. You posted this job online. - Contractor. For this job? You? - Yes. Me, Zoe. Contractor with tits. Need a minute? - No I, listen I have no issue with-- - Oh of course you don't. - Gender bias and-- - Equal opportunity. - You didn't even knock. - Practically a woman yourself. - 'Kay, my name is Mark. Let's cut to the chase. I've got some plans over here that you can take a look at. - There are copies upstairs, I already read them. You got some serious issues here, slick. - Nobody calls me slick. - This span needs more support. You're gonna need an LVL for the entire length here and the extension in the back says soundproof so you're gonna need a channel, insulation, double drywall, maybe triple. I mean sometimes you just need a threesome. In order to pass permits for fire coding you're gonna need 45 minute shutters on all the windows and I don't even think the alley out back has reasonable access for a rear entrance. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm all for a rear entrance just as much as the next school girl is, but-- - What makes you think this needs more structural support? - Experience. Look, if you don't trust me, just put into a CAD and calculate. I mean I'm sure you know your way around a keyboard. - Hey, all right, all right. That's enough of that. Listen, I appreciate your input and everything, but as far as permits go, we're not really doing this with city approval so-- - Oh, illegal. Interesting. That raises my prices somewhat. - I'm sorry, did I say I was hiring you? - I'm sorry, did I say I was working with you? - For. - Excuse me? - For me. - Oh for, right. - Look, don't get me wrong. - Oh I don't have you wrong. - No, listen. I appreciate your input and I am accepting tenders, so if you wanna drop one off sometime later this week. - Here's mine. It's all drawn up. - This, this is very thorough, this-- - Yeah, good luck with your project, slick. ♪ In the morning ♪ Are nearly eyes bright - Shit. Am I late? - No, no no, you're right on time. Actually thank you for meeting me on such short notice. - No prob. Excuse me, can I get a coffee? - Sure. - Thank you. Things got a little outta control at wing night last night. I got so hammered. What's that? - Oh, as you've probably ascertained, I've decided to employ your services. - Oh god, I fucking reek. I am sorry. You know it's really bad when you can smell yourself. - Looked over your portfolio. I'm quite impressed and I think you're completely qualified to do the job at hand. - What's the catch? - Well, every project has always a few restrictions. - Thank you. - This one's no different. - So what, you needed this done like yesterday? - Well actually I was thinking at the end of four months. But I think that's quite doable. - No, I'm sorry. Four months on a budget like this, no. That's ridiculous. - Well, unfortunately there's no flexibility on the budget that we have. - Look, it's like a sore on your dick. 'Kay, you don't just leave it there. You go and get the cream and you fix it. - I don't, I don't quite follow the analogy. - Okay, let me put it in simpler terms for you. You want this done fast and I need more guys. So I get more guys, you pay more money. - Okay, well if labor scarcity is the issue I'd be willing to contribute to the labor issue. - You wanna work? - Well I think I know my way around a toolbox. - You're definitely a tool, but I'm sorry-- - Zoe, in my business, I think the most valuable form of currency is trust. When I look at you I see a partner that I can trust. Question is, can you trust me? - Tell me something, what do I smell like to you? Tell me. Tell me. - How I love your mother's . - And she didn't immediately take off her pants? I don't get that. Hey slick, nice threads. You ready to rock? - You're 15 minutes late. - Yeah, parking was a bitch. - Can you not express yourself without swearing? Can you assure me that you're going to take this seriously? - This isn't a desk job. We're not behind schedule yet. - Right. Obviously Thing 1 and Thing 2 over here are just chomping at the bit to get to work. - Hey Zoe, you want us to shift this upstairs? - You can start by unloading the truck. - On it. - Let's clear something up here, partner. First, don't fucking talk to my guys that way. Second, what language levels are okay with? Shit, hell, cock is probably on the no-no list. Is dick okay? What about pussy? - Just a little to the right. Okay. A little more. A little more. Perfect. ♪ Treat her right to make her ♪ Think she's - First you start with the little love taps. Get the nail set, okay? Then you drop your grip to the bottom. And bash that sucker in. - It's gonna be a pain cleaning these things. - How do you clean this stuff? - Lot of Varsol, lot of elbow grease, man. - You think Coca-Cola will do it? - You know what, you're better at this than I am. So I'm just gonna have you do it. - Oh Mark. I don't use a hammer. I use a nail gun. - Hello? - Hey, Dylan. - Mark? - Yeah. Listen, I know that you said you wanted some space but I thought I'd just call and check-- - I can't really hear you. I'm out. - Can you just go outside for like a quick second? I just want to talk to you. - It's too loud in here. I'll have to call you back later, okay? - Yeah later, later's fine. Later tonight. I'll talk to you. - Yeah, I'll call you tomorrow or on the weekend. - Dylan, come on, come on. We're doing body shots. - Is that Brandon? - Everybody's taking their clothes off. - No Dylan, I just-- - Be right there. Bye Mark. - Bye. Ah! - That's good. I never understood why people don't drink. Helps remove the stress, no? Not to mention the panties, the dress, the bra. Went to doctor the other day. Told me, "Pavel, you gotta take better care of yourself. "Look out for your health. "You got way, way too much blood in your alcohol system." - That's Frank Sinatra's joke. - So what? So fucking what? - Please, please. Hey. We're all friends here. - Yeah. I'm sorry. - So, what information? - I have a delivery coming in and I need a guy for the shipping yard. - Based on what happened last time, I assumed you came to us for security. - Right. - You better get this fucking monkey off my back. - What'd you say? - Sorry about that, Charlie. Me and him, we just never saw eye to eye. - Hey, Lumpie. - No, that's Lumpie. - Oh, hey. That's right, you're Horace. - Jorge. - Hey, could you not do... I just thought I'd help the guys out with their menial tasks. You know show them that I'm a team player and everything. I got it. Totally. Not. That wasn't supposed to. Okay. - Are you coordinated at all? - Yeah, I play sports. - Which one? - Basketball. I play basketball. - Really? - Not too tough without your lackeys, eh? - Little advice, maybe you should try treating them like people. - That was, that was fun. Okay, you don't have to take it so seriously. It's just a game. - Yeah, well next time we play my game. - Huh. Why, what do you play? - I'm a black belt. - I told her that her real name and her stage name can't be the same. - Yeah, you're not wrong then. - Hey. - Parent teacher conferences. - Oh, I just heard that generosity can boost morale. Morning guys. How's it going? Got us some lattes. For you and Lumpster. And that's for you. You know I really gotta say these tool belts you guys got, they're pretty great. I guess I gotta get myself one of those, right? With some actual tools in it. What? - You can't buy yourself your own tool belt. - Of course I can. - I mean you can buy it, it's just lame. I mean you're really supposed to earn it. - Yeah, I got mine from my uncle. - Dad. - Yeah, I got mine for my eighth birthday. I was an advanced child. - Can I ask your opinion about something? - Yeah, I guess. - My girlfriend, she wants to take some space. - Was this your idea or hers? - Oh yeah, no it was mine. Well mutual. Hers. - Ouch, that's rough, man. - Yeah, I think she just needs some time to like sort some stuff out, think about things. - Before moving onto somebody else? - Can I use that gun? - Mark? - Hey. Hey Dylan. What, what are the odds, huh? - The odds, the odds of meeting in front of the yoga studio where I've been taking the same class for three years? - Yeah I guess it was kind of, but hey, now that we're both here we might as well get some shawarma huh? - We're supposed to be taking some time apart. - It's got the humus and those turnips that you really like. - Cut the shit, Mark. There's a time and a place. - Yeah and god forbid you ever do something that goes against your own plan. - Oh, this coming from the guy who'd pierce his own scrotum if his boss asked him to. - Yeah. If it was a direct order, you bet I would. Heck, I'd even pierce yours. - Very funny. - Listen, I didn't come here to fight, okay? - I thought you didn't come here on purpose. - Exactly. - Miller. You mother ribbing little scrode, what are you doing here? - You're going to yoga with that guy? - Yeah, I am. He likes yoga. - I liked yoga. - When I invited you, you were like "Why would I pay to bend myself like a pretzel?" - Well excuse me if I put my money towards more practical uses than your philosophical chakra mumbo jumbo. - Oh my god this is so fucked. - I don't know about you but I'm a little parched. - Yes. - I think it's smoothie time. - Yeah, you know what, I could go for a smoothie too. - Yeah. Namaste! Bye Miller. So I'm thinking some pineapple, maybe some coconut water. A little bit of kelp. - Oo. - Just above the ice line. - Oh yeah. - Maybe a whack load of wheat grass. - What do you do for fun? - Binge watch Netflix series. - Which one? - I watch two series of Law and Order. - What? - What? - Why the fuck would you buy Netflix to watch Law and Order? My Nana is blind and she can find it on television all day every day. So what's the plan for this place? - What do you care? - I don't, I'm just trying this thing called conversation. - All right. So what about you? How many more of these do ya gotta build before ya hang up your tool belt? - Why would I wanna do that? - Isn't that the whole idea? - I love being boots to the ground and god, why would I give all this up for mind numbing bureaucracy? - How'd you get into this anyway? - My dad. We used to build fences together and he was really handy. He taught me how to use his tools and yeah. - And? - Look, just because you can pack an organized lunch doesn't mean you get to linger. Break is over bitches. Hey. Careful. The stuff is basically ether you breathe it too much it'll knock you out. It's too bad we couldn't have done a real demo here. - Why? - It's just so much fun to hit shit with a sledgehammer. - Yeah, I can see that. - Okay now turn it clockwise. But be careful not to overtighten. - God. Hey. My eyes are up here, lady. - I waited all night for you. So I made myself at home. Let's have a drink. - I'm gonna call the cops. - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Be cool, be cool Charlie, everything's okay. I just came here to chat. Couldn't help noticing this picture of your sister. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. It's your wife, I know it's your wife. It's a hot, little beetle, this one. - What do you want? - All work and no play makes city clerk a dull boy. - How do you know where I work? - You should tell her to be careful. It's a dangerous world. Especially for a hot little tomato like this. Get me the schedule for all incoming cargo ships. I'll be in touch in a couple days. - Shalom, shalom! - Why does he keep saying that? - 'Cause he think he's part of the A-team. I gotta be honest, I don't know why you'd want to go so far for a security mechanism. - It's also for fire protection. - If I've installed it right, and I'm always right, it's on its own circuit, so it gets set off either by keypad or fire alarms. Supposed to come down fast. And once it's down, nobody gets in. - Or out. Should we give it a go? - Yeah. No shit. - Far out. - Sliced. - Perfect. - For here or to go? - For here. - To go. - I just have to say it is really great to see you. - Yeah, it's been a while. - Yeah, it has. It's been too long, actually. And you know this time apart has just, it's been the worst. - Oh it's been so liberating. - Yeah. That's what it's been. - Right, I mean being alone and then you know, moving on. Whew. I mean you probably suspected that Brandon and I were starting to. - Yeah, you and Brandon. Yeah well I saw you the other day. So I assumed something, but then again you didn't say anything. So I figured. - Sorry. I haven't been getting much sleep these days. - Yeah, work right? Probably pretty crazy. - Yeah not really. I mean agent life is busy, but mostly it's Brandon. - Well I... - I just, I really need to get something off my chest. - What do you mean? - Well, I've been having like the most amazing sex in my life lately. Did you know that he spent a summer in India? He's been teaching me about tantric sex. - That's great. - It's great. I mean it just, it goes on forever. Like hours and hours and hours. To the point where it hurts, but you know in that good way. What about you? You seeing anyone? - Um. - OMG, Dylan. - Hey. - This is so funny. I just picked up my dress for Saturday. So cute. BTDubs. - Saturday? - Yeah the party at Dylan's place. Or should I say-- - I'll just see you then. I can't wait to catch up. Bye. - Okay, cool. Ciao. - You're having a party. - Yeah, it's just a little get together. Not a big thing. I would've invited you, but it's it's sort of a couple thing. - Oh that's okay. That means I can go. 'Cause I have a girlfriend. - Remind me again how you got me to come to this thing. - Because I promised you a case of beer and my undying gratitude. - Sixth Floor. - You look, you look great. - Thank you. God. I haven't done this since my brother's wedding. I can't walk in these things. - Yeah, it's just heel, toe. - I fucking hate these things. - Okay, that's not embarrassing. - I'm going to live here. - Great. I'll go get us some drinks. Just try to stand up. - Okay. - Definitely, trust me. Excuse me, maybe you can help us settle this. - No, no, I'm not. - No, no, no, this is perfect, this is great. You seem like a really smart girl. My friend here has a very, very important decision to make. - Okay. - Kind of embarrassing. - Just ask. - So I'm in med school. I work with kids. Kids with cancer. I don't cure the cancer, but I make it better. Okay? Where my passion takes me is driving cars. Race cars, I drive for Formula One. - Gets off on that driving. - And so I'm at a crossroads. I need to know do I stick with med school or do I drive? - You know I tell him, stick with it. Because really, I mean think of the children. - So what do you think? - This is a good little routine you guys got down. Probably plow a lotta pussy with this one, right? You know what I'm saying? Next time, try vet, fighter pilot. Think about it, right? Way better. - You know there's a bunch of hookers doing bumps in the mens room. Wow. - Yeah. Let's jet. - Hell yes. - I was taking care of them. - Yeah, I know, I know. It looked like you had it all under control. But it was pretty fun coming in and saving the day. - Well I do declare. Thank you ever so much my gentleman caller. - Oh, hi Mark. So nice of you to make it. - Yeah Dylan. This is Zoe. - Joey? Charmed. Honey. Brandon? - Yeah. - Come here. - Hey. - Brandon, this is Mark's friend Zoe. - Nice to meet you. So you and Mark, is that a thing? - Oh. - I really like your dress. - Thank you. - Yeah, I think I wore that exact same one to formal in junior year. - Is that before you started aiming a little more obvious with your look? If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get myself some extremely overpriced cheese. - Sweetie. - Yeah? - My glass is empty. - All right, I'll get it. - Thanks. Dry, two olives. - Yeah, extra dirty. - Your new girlfriend is-- - Dylan it's-- - No, I was just gonna say she's not what I expected. She's not exactly your type. - Well you know. Branch out, I guess. - Um hmm. - What's with all the presents? Your birthday's not for another three months. - Oh those, well it's not, that's not really why we had the party. - Then why are you having a party? - Uh, Brandon and I, we've decided to move in together. - Wow. - So you're a veterinarian and a fighter pilot? - With little puppies? - The smallest little puppies. - Wow. - Heck yeah. - That's so cute. - Don't I know it. - You know when you and I were together, you didn't even talk about moving in. - It's a different time and place, Mark. - Um hmm. - I should mingle. - I'm just gonna. Thank you. Thank you very much, you're doing a great job. - Hey there, buddy. - Hello. - Yeah, it's time that we go home. - No, no. They just got another thing of champagne for me. - No, no, no, we don't need any more of that. Okay? I think it's just time to go home. This way, this way, this way, this way. Other way. - We gotta open one present. Howdy, howdy. Tell 'em about the hiking adventure. Tell 'em exactly what I did. - Hey, do you think you're so bossy 'cause you're so short? - Yes. - Remember this guy Napoleon? He tried to do that. And then what happened? Where are we going? Are you gonna make me go home? - No. I'm pretty sure if I take you home you'd put on super depressing music and then jump out your own window. - You don't know me. This car gonna make it all the way to wherever we're going? - The car is fine. - You ever get that feeling in your mouth, feel like you're gonna throw up? - Are you gonna puke? - What? - Can you do it out the window, please? - Oh yeah, 'cause puking in this car would make it so much worse than it already is. You and I both know it'd make an improvement. Smells like despair and broken dreams. Hey, watch it on the speed bumps. Um hmm. - Here. Careful. It is hot. - I got it. - Great. - Thank you. Um hmm. Um hmm. - This is my kinda party. - Um hmm. Mm, you know how we can make this a better party. We gotta call those guys. The Jorge and Lumpie? - Lumpie. - Yeah. We bring these guys to the party. I'll just call them. We'll get 'em. I don't have their numbers. You, you have their numbers. You call those guys. - Yes, I do, but I think it's a little late for the party. - No, no, we're here. - So why don't we just sit down. - They can come. All right. - Right. Okay. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. You are so annoying. And you're bossy. And ya sweat like a sailor. - Can you just sit down please? - What are you doing? You don't need to do-- - Thank you that is a great list of things you don't like about me. - Yeah but you're also. - Sit, sit. - You're so pretty. - And you are drunk. And I'm just a stand-in for the girl that you actually want. - No, you're, you're Zoe. - Yes and I'm not a girlfriend, girl. - Yeah but you're so smart and strong and confident. - Sorry to interrupt. I'm really taken aback here, Mark. - She's my contractor. - You try to bed your contractors? - Absolutely not. - This is an important project. I put my trust in your dedication and commitment. And now I find you here-- - Hey we were just up to-- - With what? What could you and Ms. Crawford possibly have been doing that would explain this? - You're right. I admit that sir. Wait a minute. How do you know Zoe's name? - It's part of my job. I'm supposed to look out for you and make sure you're working with the right people. I thought we were a team. Maybe that was a mistake. - No sir, it wasn't. I will get this built. Exactly the way you want it. I won't let ya down. - The arrival date's been moved forward by two weeks. Everything still needs to be completed as planned. - He's quite the charmer. So do you wanna tell me who that is? - No, I'm not. Come on, let's go. - Look, that was a little weird. - He's an investor, all right. End of conversation. Come on, I'll call ya a cab. - Don't bother, I'll be fine. - What about your heels? - I'll get 'em tomorrow. - Great. - Good to see ya again, Charlie. - Here. - You do good work. - This is it. I'm done. You won't come to me again. - Sure thing, Charlie. - I want my photo back. - Get outta the car. - My god, that girl still doesn't have her own license, huh? - No, she finishes at 3:00. - Bye guys. - You gonna be okay, hun? - Yeah, yeah, I'll see ya tomorrow, okay? - Have a good one. - Forget something? - Nope. - Excuse me, who are you? - City Inspector. - I didn't have an inspection booked for today. - Surprise. - Great. What do you need to see? - Well I need to see the contractor, for one thing. - I'm the contractor. - You're the contractor? - Yeah, are the specific areas of the building that you're concerned with? - How's the framing? - It's to code. - Um hmm. - And the fire separation? - To code. - Insulation? - It's all to code. Look, can I see some ID? Who the hell are you? - Don't you think someone like you should have a little more respect for someone in my position? You know I can make your life miserable. I could have you tied up for weeks. I'll see ya again. - He took one look at that ceiling and it was just like fuck. - Which guy? - The mud guy. - Up north? - Yeah, yeah, the mud guy. - Fuck. - So good with mud, this guy? - Guy was a master. - An artist. - Wizard, I mean you took one look at that shit and it was just like, like. - Like fuck? - Exactly. - You'da blown that guy. - Yeah, I woulda blown that guy. - Hellsie, I woulda blown him too. - You would've blown him? - Oh hell yeah. You should've seen this place. Ceiling perfectly smooth. Like a palace, he made it seem. - Guy could mouth fuck me if he wanted it, like right down my throat. - Who's got my buddy John up and running, bitches? Should work. - Oh, here. Sorry. Yeah you just gotta release the pressure valve first. - What the fuck you know that? - Not rocket science, Zoe. - Oh! - What the? - Whoo! - Master mother. - Sucker. - Come on, yeah.

Can I help you find anything? - This dress is swell. Do you have it in a size two? - I'll check. - Well, well, well. - It's all about stamina. Keeps me sharp. Self discipline, alertness. None of that caffeine shit though, that's poison. Cancer. Game over. I ever tell you about the bang and burn in Botswana? - Many times. - I wasn't on my toes. Precision, drug free precision. Perfect blood cell. I like to stake out my neighbors twice a week just to keep sharp. I'll take a bullet right through the god damn teeth if you ask. Never leave my post. Eyes are always on target. Even if that means 72 hours without a piss break. I'll still be here Christmas day, Passover, vacations to Disney World, dentist appointments. - That is a solid combination. - You've gone blind. - What? No. You've confused your business acumen with design decor. - And I think you're confusing my ass with your face. - No, I don't think that's possible. Here, that's it. - No, not that. This is it. This makes more sense. - No, that's it. - Not anything. This is it. Okay, just keep it like that. - No. - Yes. Just gimme the thing. - No. - Just. Look, just do it my way. - No. - For once. Please. - Fuck you. Whoa. Who do you think you are? - Hey, I could ask you the same thing. - I mean you don't even know a thing. - Yeah well, you have terrible taste. - Yeah, in men. - That's gonna stain. Bitch. Ow. You gonna do as I say? - Just make me. - Yeah. - That was. - Yeah. - I mean. Whoo. - Oh yeah. - You were. - No I know, yeah. - Okay Yeah. It pays to stay late at work sometimes. - You're telling me. - So we should-- - No, no not. Please just not right now. - Yeah no, you're right. We'll talk about this later. - No really, like not now. - No, I said stop. - No just. - Probably stop talking about it right now. - Yes. - I mean. Well that's a good idea. - Um hmm. - Hey, can I ask you a question? - Shoot. - What happened to your dad? - Why are you asking that? - Just curious. - He died. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, aren't we all? He was in the military. And he always followed orders to the T. And one day those orders got him killed. I'm never going down like that. - It's a safe house. - What? - This place. It's a safe house. It's covert, maybe. - Get outta here. - No, I'm serious. That's why we have all this weird stuff in here. - And that guy? - My partner, yeah. He's a spy. - He is? - Well we both kinda are. - No shit. This is so badass. I love it. Can you fire a gun? - Yeah but, listen, you gotta keep your mouth shut. - Well I hope you don't literally because. - Oh. Sorry I'm a few minutes late, sir. - 10, you're 10 minutes late. - Yeah sorry. - We're three days out. I thought you would have delivered by now. What's the problem? You distracted by that skirt you have working for ya? - No sir, she's just-- - I expected a level of professionalism from you, Mark. - And that's what you're getting. Everything is strictly professional on the job site and we will deliver on the date. - You'd better. This needs to be done. I needs to be safe. There are people's lives on the line here. - Yes sir. - I'll be there on Thursday afternoon. Just make sure that your contractor has evacuated the place before I get there. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hey. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, it's fine. - Are you sure? - We should probably talk. Last night was really fun. - Fun. - Just great. But I still made a mistake. I think it's important that I just keep things between us professional. - Professional? - Yeah. Think about it. You work for me. So it's inappropriate if I engage. - I work with you. Don't worry. You won't be engaging in anything with me ever again. - Well? - Perfect. - Wow, I guess the early bird gets shit done. - Well someone around here had to. - What's that supposed to mean? - Nothing. I just didn't realize you guys wouldn't get to the hardware yesterday. - Ow! - What? - I cut myself. - Well put a Band-Aid on it. We don't have any time to lose. Oh and Zoe, don't bleed on any of the fixtures. I don't know if we can get it out. - What the fuck is your problem? - My problem? - Yeah, since when did you become such an asshole? - I don't have time for this. Listen, we're under the wire with this thing and we need to get it done before-- - Before what? The witnesses come? - I told you not to talk about that. - Doesn't it strike you as kind of odd, Mark? A building built for witnesses would need this much sound proofing and a spring-loaded fire door? - You don't know what you're talking about. - And why do you have such a boner for hierarchy calling Jorge and Lumpie my subordinates? - Because that's what they are. They work for you. You pay them. They're your subordinates, just like-- - Just like what? - Just like your my subordinate. - Fuck you! - Oh come. Son a gun. Listen to me. I know that you got this whole issue with authority. - Excuse me? There is something wrong with this building, Mark. - No, there isn't. - Screw you. I don't need this. - Yes, you do. Because this property is the only thing in your portfolio. - I'd rather have nothing in my portfolio than turn into a corporate piss ant. - Well it's a lot better than a truckload of daddy issues, isn't it? - You're an asshole. And I quit. - Hello ladies. Welcome to nowhere. - Thanks. Now where's the third key? - I think Zoe has it. - Well it's nice working for ya, man. - With. - Right. - Hey, when you see her, just tell Zoe that I-- - You tell her yourself, man. Peace out. - Yeah, you too. Thanks again, guys. Huh. - Look, kid. - Sir. - This is excellent. - Thank you sir. - I know I was hard on you, but that's because it was my job. I had zero margin for error. - Hey, I totally understand that. Not a problem. Listen, this is a map to all the security features. You got camera locations, fail safe devices. - Very detailed. You deserve it. It'll be active next week. - So they arrive tonight, then? - Oh listen Mark, you've worked everything out to a T. I'll take care of it from here. - Okay. - Go. - Well I just want you to know that like I kinda wanna see this thing through, you know? - Go, celebrate. Celebrate your achievement. - Sure. Well, thanks again. And good luck. ♪ Can I get a yes ♪ Do you know how to speak ♪ And now I - The guy that picked me up for possession again, fucking nonsense. Hold on. Hey Zoe. - Hey, Lumpie, have you seen my extension ladder? - Shit. I think I left it at the house. - Go pick it up. - Yeah, sure thing. Fuck. - Can't believe I forgot this fucking thing here. Fuck. Oh shit. Guys, I just, I just came here to pick up some stuff man. I didn't want any trouble. We can talk about this, right? You guys seem reasonable, huh? No? Guys. - Oh fuck. Dude, dude. Oh my. Shit. 911. I need a fucking ambulance right now. - He's not a clumsy guy. - It was an accident. - No, it's that building. - Listen Zoe, if it's about Mark-- - Do not. I'm gonna go check something. You stay here and don't leave him alone. Get me? - Okay Zoe, but if you-- - Just stay here. Okay. Oh man. You have to help me. This guy he's here. - Calm down, young lady, calm down. Pavel, you're supposed to clean up messes, not create new ones. Take care of it. - Hey, stick around. - I'm just gonna go get a coffee. I'll be right back. - TSwift4234. YogaGurl1467. Namaste3333. Yes! What happened that night? How did he miss them? - You botched the coordinates, Mark. - Wait. That's not what I sent. Caehill? What'd she say? No. 24 Klein? - The structure behind me may look like a regular home, but in fact it was being used in a human trafficking ring. Women, being captured and then sold off to the highest bidder. Many dead, starved or worse. Of the few that were found alive, many appear traumatized and unable to identify their captors. - Couldn't leave it alone, Miller? - Caehill you sick son of a--. - I was willing to let you go if you'd only stayed a yes man. But you had to go and play detective. And I can't have you interfering with the auction. The land title will be in your name. Everything ties back to you. The organization will disallow any knowledge. In a matter of hours the girls'll be sold. I'll have my money and everyone will blame you. Go in peace, Miller. - Zoe. Zoe, Zoe, it's me, it's Mark. Listen, you were right. You were right about everything. But I promise you that I'll. - Get up. Slowly. - Brandon, you're making a big-- - Slow down you spastic piss ant. - You don't know what's happening here. It's Caehill, okay? It's not me. You gotta believe me. - Oh I believe you. - Got you something. - You expect me to wear that? - I want you to feel like a lady. - Well you have a tampon? 'Cause you know. - Go ahead. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Pure platinum baby. - Let's go for a little walk, Miller. - Caehill must have installed a daemon to alert him if the file's edited. - I knew you were the leak. - No, it's a setup. - Sure it is. Move. - Brandon are you hearing any of what I'm saying? - Shut your mouth. - Listen, I have proof. - I said shut your god damn mouth. - Does it make sense to you that he wants me dead instead of arrested? If you want Dylan back you're gonna start listening to what I have-- - What did you say to me? Huh? What did you say? - Well you can't terminate me here. It'd be too messy. - Fine. Here it is then. - No Brandon, listen to me. I have something that's gonna prove it's not me. Just look at my phone. Look in the documents. - What's this? - The coordinates I sent the night the girls were marketed. Look at it. It's not what you got, right? Look at the time signature. It's Caehill, okay? I'm telling ya. Let me guess, he said do as I say. No more, no less. Right? That's what he said. - Carter. - Yes sir. - Just get done. - It's done. Suspect resisted arrest. What's the play? So no witnesses? - It's sex trafficking. Slaves, servants. These women are being brought here to be sold off like slabs of beef. I built a god damn human distribution center. - So why the hell did he choose you? - 'Cause I'm the perfect target. I'm loyal to a fault and easily disposable. It was all set up to a T and if we don't stop this, nobody can. - This is bad. I'm calling Jarvis. - Don't. Caehill's got too many friends. Right now we can't trust anyone. - Great idea, Tex. Let's just waltz in there alone. Yeah, I got an idea. I'm gonna take my fucking gun out and shoot us both in the fucking face with it. We need backup in case the trick goes south. Which it will. - Why don't you call Dylan? - Still need one more. - I got some people that I could call. - These guys the real deal? Don't fuck with me. - Oh yeah. They're pros all right. - Whoa, good job. - Mm. - So you just? - Yeah just. Done. You think his pants'll fit me? - Well denim is your color. Hey amigo. Listen, there is something weird happening in your villa. - Yeah, I know. Look, I'm gonna need your help, Jorge. But this job is a little bit more dangerous. - Well this is awkward. - Oh. - Hey, this is fun. - You wear a lotta black. You in the theater? Goth, the cure? - Where's Zoe? - Sit down. Down. - Quite the operation you got running here. He seems well adjusted. - Who else knows about this place? - Nobody. - We know all about you and Mr. Miller. Now tell me who else you've told. - Fine, your ex-wife. - Hard under pressure. I like that. Not like your father. I know they told you he died while serving the flag but truth is we think he just shit his pants when the going got too tough. Died crying to enemy like a. You tell me who else knows about this place or your boyfriend dies. - Fuck you. You're gonna kill him anyway. - You're right. I already did. I saved you his last words. - Zoe, Zoe, Zoe. It's me, it's Mark. Listen, you were right. You were right about everything. But I promise you that I-- - Get up, slowly. It's done. - Thanks. Okay. Faced on what Lumpy saw, there's probably like 10 or 15 girls inside. So if I try to get in there, I can just-- - No, you're not going anywhere, all right? I need you on recon. Agent Smith and I are on point. Now Mark's information is accurate, the auction starts at 2100 hours. That's 9:00 o'clock, dickhead. - You mean in 10 minutes. - Agent Smith and I pose as buyers. 12 minutes for entrenchment then it's time for Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum. - Huh? - We gotta create a diversion. Throw out their muscle. - Look, we just need you to act like a couple of ignorant troglodytes, all right? So just be yourselves. - Brandon, that's enough okay? These guys have shown us serious sack here. - That's a lotta cajoles. - Serious sack. - Look, beyond that door is death. It's gonna take a hell of a lot more than sack. - Were you able to prep a transmitter? - Okay, once it's active I'll be able to access the network on the CC TV. - How many hostiles you figure inside? - Around six. - Six. Ya! Dylan, how many hostiles can you handle, two? Wait. Can you handle one? - Yeah, I think we're good to go. - Let's saddle up. - That guy. - Okay team, get ready. I'm almost there. Stage one, we're a go. Dylan. I have visual. Guys, I think there's a single asset in the back room. - Welcome gentlemen. May I present to you, lot 25. Mr. Goro, would you like to start the bidding? $10,000. - Stage two, we're a go. - Honey, honey. Honey! - I told you to get off my back. - Yeah, when it's your family it's so important. What about last weekend with Rose? - You knew how important that dinner with my mom was and you didn't listen. - Okay good. - Now when the shoe's on the other foot, then I treated Rose like gold! - You need to move along. This is private property, eh? - Tell that to this guy. He never follows directions. Last week-- - Entrenchment achieved. - Okay Brandon, it's showtime. Get ready. Go! - 15, thank you very much. Anybody else? $16,000. We see 20? $20,000? Sold. After you. Thank you gentlemen, we'll see you soon. Thank you. Thank you. - Ya! - Oh no! - Oh no. What the fuck? Dylan, get outta there. - Shit. Dylan wait, don't go down-- - Hey, where do you think you're going? Just. - Zoe? - Zoe! - What are? - Look what we have here. - God. - Dude, what's going on. - Zoe's inside. They've already taken out Dylan and Brandon. I gotta get in there somehow. - They'll kill you. - But we can't just sit here. - Well what are we going to do? - Fuck it. Time to move, boys. Now remember, once you guys bust through that wall I'm gonna need you to come back to the car because you guys are gonna be my eyes and ears. You got it? - Wouldn't it be easier to just drive them out the front? - When we cut the power we're gonna need another way out. Understand? Now I think I can scramble their cameras, giving us about 90 seconds to break in undetected. Speaking of time, we're running out of it. Let's go. - Shh. Go. - No collateral damage. - Three. Two. One. - Apologies for the interruption, everyone. Everything will be back to normal very soon. ♪ In the dark ♪ You can never stand apart ♪ You can never stand alone ♪ Come closer ♪ Then we feel our skin ♪ It's so beautiful ♪ When you let me in ♪ Move into the future ♪ Forget the past - Hi. - Are you okay? - Thanks, man. - Okay, where's the sledgehammer? - Aw shit. I hate this day. Zoe. - What are you doing? Help me. What are you just sitting there for? Why aren't you doing anything? - The man who's coming isn't good enough for you. - Mark, no, no! - Zoe. - Oh fuck. - Look at this. This is what you want? - Hey. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. I need you. - Well that is very sweet. But now it's time to fight. Hmm? Huh? - Any tips? - You're a quick study. - Who's first? Sorry. Are you okay? - Yeah, I almost had him. - I know. You were very good. - I was good? - Yeah you were. - All right love birds. Play time's over. Hey, we had fun. - Behind you - Toss me the weapon, Mr. Miller. Now! Bind the girls. Start with her. - Hey! - I'm out patience. Tie them up now or you're all dead. - Okay, okay. Just calm down, all right. I'll do whatever you want me to do, just don't. - You girls face the wall. Hands behind your backs. The press are gonna eat this up. A failed fed agent joins forces with the Russian mafia to buy and sell dozens of underage girls. Only to be caught by his former colleagues who made a brave attempt to stop him. Sadly in the chaos that ensued, a house fire started resulting in considerable loss of life. - Caehill. You win. It's over. Don't I get some sorta consolation prize? A smoke at least. - Who am I to deny a dying man his last wish? Oh, by the way, you're not supposed to inhale. - I'll write that down. Hey, hey. You all right? - Yeah. - You sure? - Oh god. I'm okay. Here. - Everybody's okay? You guys all right? Eek, looks pretty bad. - Yeah. - You on the other hand. - Oh my god. Guys, guys. Guys! Guys. This is really sweet. I'm really happy for you, but do you mind untying us first? You do realize that there's like half a human lying over there, right? - Private conference number 4137. Agent Jarvis with former analyst Miller. - So did you say something like don't go to pieces on me, Caehill, or you're not half the man you used to be, Caehill. Or you fucking jerk? Something? - No, no, I didn't say any of that. - Oh. Well that's good too. Well anyway, Miller. You saved a dozen lives. You busted a human trafficking ring that three agencies have been chasing for years. - And I got the coordinates right, too. - Yeah that too. Well I'm here to offer you full reinstatement. You'll be made agent second class immediately. What you always wanted. - You know what, sir? I think I'm gonna pass. Plus I'm already late to the job site and this time of day, parking's a real bitch down there. ♪ I know a place where you - Do what you gotta do, slick. ♪ I can feel your heart ♪ You were taken by a wave - You gotta admit this was kinda fun. - Nope. - Not even a little bit? - No. - Well what about the-- - Nope. - All right. We gotta take this whole thing down, huh? - All the way down. - All the way down? - Um hmm. - Oh do we? - You gonna do as I say? - Just make me.
