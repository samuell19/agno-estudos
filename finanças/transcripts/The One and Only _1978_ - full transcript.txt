Stay. Andy, I hear you're very talented. Yes. Well, he certainly isn't what you'd call shy. He's got a lot of confidence in himself. Andy, would you honor us with a song? Mom, are there any more people comin'? No, Andy. A regular entertainer! Well, I think we're gonna have another Eddie Cantor. A lot of confidence! Mr. Willingham, I think you could see better if you moved to that chair. Mrs. Davis, why don't you come up front? Mom, could you turn off the big light and just give me the lamp in the corner. Would you two be seated, please? Skags, I work alone. (BARKS) Hit it, Ma. (PLAYING MUSIC) ♪ Mammy ♪ Mammy ♪ The sun shines east ♪ The sun shines west ♪ I know where the sun shines best ♪ Mammy Please pass the cookies. You want me to sing or do you wanna talk? (MUSIC STOPS) Andy, you apologize immediately! I apologize. Are you through talking? Yes. Good. Yes! Don't I know you from someplace? Weren't you taller and much older? Tell me, do you ever pick your nose? What? Well, what I mean is, I can't imagine anyone as pretty as you are ever picking your nose. I pick. I'd sure like to take you to dinner some night. Oh, well, this conversation has made me hungry. Why would you like to take me to dinner? Good food, good conversation. Perhaps some pre-marital sex. (STAMMERING) Wha...what is this? Who are you? The one and only Andy Schmidt! Who are you? Ah, the ever-popular Mary Crawford. And totally unavailable. Wait a minute! Wait one minute. Wait a minute! Is your mother still good looking? Yes. Why? Because if I marry you, I don't want an old bag at age 46! Have you ever seen me in anything? School play or anything? Uh, no. I'm terrific! I've been taking acting classes since I was 12. I'm gonna be a star! Or a fireman. Are you sure? About being a star? Well, I have doubts. Thursdays. Look, I have to go to rehearsal. Where do you live? Uh, the Kappa house, but I'm kind of going with someone. Oh, whoever it is, I like me better. I can't wait to kiss you! See ya! Don't worry if you're a virgin! Whatever goes on between us, I keep my mouth shut! All right, people! People! People! (CLAPPING) Oh, for Christ's sake, will everyone just shut up? All right now. (CLAPPING) Stop talking! Quiet! Shut up! Quiet! Shut up! Schmidt! You are the one who's talking! I think you're right. (ALL LAUGHING) (SIGHS) Now, people, this is your play. If you want to make it into a turd... Let's see a show of hands. (ALL LAUGHING) Mr. Schmidt, do you wanna be in this play? Oh, yes, I think this turd needs me. Look, one more word out of you, Schmidt, and you are out of this play! I will not have this! Do you understand? I'm sorry, Mr. Moses, I was just trying to keep the morale up. Well, Mr. Schmidt, since you are so anxious to perform, we'll run your scene right now. Oh, have you memorized your line, Mr. Schmidt? Yes, sir. Good. Arnold? Would you and your entourage be so good as to cue Mr. Schmidt? Perhaps then we can excuse him for his football practice. ARNOLD: All right, now, places, people, places. Let's go. Get to your places, now. Get ready for your cue. Let's go. All right, let's hear the drums. (DRUM ROLL PLAYING) My country, I fear, grows weary of me. My lord, may I speak? Hold it! Stop! Where does it say, "May I speak?" (ACTORS CHUCKLING) Sir. Mr. Moses, this man happens to be in charge of a very large country. A guard doesn't just go up and start talking. (ALL LAUGHING) Schmidt! Do just what is in the script! Don't push me Schmidt, hmm? Cue him again. My country, I fear, grows weary of me. My lord... Death would be an honor, if death were serving you! (SOBBING) You're crying. Why are you crying? Here I'm trying to show that the guys down at the guardhouse feel terrible for him. (ALL LAUGHING) It's something I've been working on at home. Schmidt, I don't want the guards to cry. How 'bout hollow laughter showing frustration? Huh, huh, huh, huh. (ACTORS LAUGHING) No laughs, no crying! I guess urinating on him is totally out of the question. (ACTORS LAUGHING) So, I have this degree in sociology, and, um, well, what do I do with it? Open a sociology store! Let's talk about me! You like yourself very much, don't you? I think I have great taste! Do people like you ever get married? I think your only chance is to get me before I'm successful. You're a lunatic. Lunatic? Lunatic? I don't think that's quite fair. I might be a little eccentric, perhaps. Hold all my calls, please! A lunatic is someone who is mentally disturbed. Ah, insane, perhaps. But in my case, I think I'm just your regular guy with regular quirks. I love carrots. I was a rabbit for several years. Are you expecting any more calls? Isn't this fun? Later, there's a good chance we'll make love. Andy. Huh? This is the first date I've had with anyone but Paul in 2 years. I mean, I don't even know why I'm here! Mary, do you have any idea who I am? You? Quick! Very quick! Watch your tongue. I happen to be a big talent. I can sing, dance, act, tell jokes. I can imitate anyone! Paul's going to be a doctor. Paul's going to be a member of the audience. Everyone you ever meet, except me, is going to be a member of the audience. But on the side, he'll be a doctor. (IMITATING GROUCHO MARX) On the side, he'll have a nurse.

No. Well, in that case, you had the salad. I had the peas. With your share of the tip, you owe... Kids... Every one of you kids is like my own son to me. Win or lose today, I want each and every one of you to know how I feel. Like your father. That's really nice! (ALL SNICKERING) Now, guys, we are playing a rough crew out there today! They're supposed to be faster. I read in the paper this morning they're faster than we are! Are they? ALL: (SHOUTING) No! We've got some fast guys! Schmidt, answer with the rest of the team, will you, please? Check! Some say they're bigger. Well, maybe they are. No! (PLAYERS SNICKERING) I'm sorry. I thought we were all gonna say "no" together. (LAUGHING) Please continue. Oh, thank you, Mr. Schmidt. Well, some of them are bigger. But I always say, the team that wants to win the most, is the team that wins the most! Now, goddamn it, who wants this game more? ALL: (SHOUTING) We do! All right, now. You're all my sons. Now, go on out there and win this one for your father! I wanna stomp their asses! I wanna kill those bastards! I'm up! If you don't sit down, you asshole, you probably won't even get in the game! Oh, yeah. (LAUGHING) Now let's go out there and win this one! You heard him! Let's move it! (ALL YELLING) Move it! Hustle! Hustle! Let's go! Move it out there! Let's go! Let's go! Hustle! Hustle, coach! Get out there and hustle! Hustle! Hustle! Get your ass out there! (CROWD CHEERING) Coach, that Ferguson's a killer! He's tearin' everybody apart in there! Hey, Schmidt! Schmidt! Come here! Yes? We need someone to stop Ferguson. Right. He's gotta be stopped! How about Jones? Nobody likes him. COACH: Goddamn it, Schmidt, you get in there! You play Ferguson! Schmidt! Put your helmet on! My helmet! My helmet! I'm in! I'm in! Jerk! ANNOUNCER: Now playing guard for Ohio Southern, Schmidt, number 33. (CROWD CHEERING) All right, you asked for it! I'll take you on! Get out of there! PLAYER: All right, let's go now, guys. (PLAYERS SHOUTING) Ohio break! Come on! Let's go. Let's go! Set. (PLAYERS SHOUTING) Hike! (PLAYERS SHOUTING) Hup. Hup. (GRUNTING) (WHISTLE BLOWS) (CROWD GASPING) (WHISTLE BLOWS) All right, get out there. Go get him. (BAND PLAYING MUSIC) (GASPS) (APPLAUSE) Psst! Don't rush. Don't rush! I love where your hand is. I beg your pardon, both of my hands are around you. Excuse me. It was my hand. You even make jokes when you're kissing. Well, sure, why shouldn't necking be fun? Even faking a football injury's fun, huh? And scaring me half to death? I wasn't faking. I was acting. That was a great performance. Did you see that audience? Did they love me? Are you acting all the time? How 'bout when you're kissing me? Is that acting? Is this conversation a part of the act? Who the hell are you, really? Mary, listen to me. What's inside me is too strong to control. Is it too strong or are you too weak? Who do you think you are, criticizing me? What I am is great! I know it and you're afraid of it! You better be great. You're the most insecure person I've ever met. Get out. (ENGINE STARTING) Aw, get in! You're acting like a child! Mary, I'm under a lot of pressure. I just wanted to talk to you. I'm sorry. I'm the wrong person. You need help. Do me a favor, and don't ever try to take me out again. You're only fun as a stranger. Get out. If I get out, I'm not gonna get back in. I'll take that chance. All right, marry your doctor! Do you think I need a middle-class broad like you holding me back? You can tell your kids you once dated a star! Car trouble? No. I'm an enormously talented young actor. I sing, I dance, I do impersonations, and she wants to be with some doctor! We're not getting along. I threw her outta the car, but I can't leave her here. You don't have car trouble? No. I'm headed for New York as soon as this school year is over. I'm talkin' about Broadway. I have offers, you know. Could you take me back to the campus? He's nuts. You see what I mean? Why am I with her? I thought she was different. Uh, could you just keep quiet? Typical! I'll drive you to the campus. Harold, this could be dangerous! No, just boring. Get in. Here, I'll say good night here. There you go. Drive safely! For sure. Okay. Bye-bye! I'll call ya! (TRUMPET PLAYING OFF-KEY ) Does that sound like Harry James? No. Andy. Yeah? Did you see the school paper today? Was my name mentioned? No. Forget it. I guess you don't know that Mary Crawford got engaged to Paul Harris last night. No, I didn't see that. Gosh! I'm so happy for her. I'm sorry, Andy. Eddie, where am I going? Broadway. What am I going to be? A star. Do I need her? No. I love her, you asshole! Mary, I'm so happy. I'm glad now that we decided to wait to uh... Uh... You know. Paul, why don't we just... Go out tonight and get drunk? Just be funny and crazy with each other. I mean, we'll never be as young as we are tonight. Yes, that would be a lot of fun, but I have classes tomorrow morning starting at 8:00, and you don't drink. That's another thing I'm waiting to do. Mary! Oh, Christ! I have to talk to you! Uh, pardon me, I don't think I know you. I'm Andy. Are you Paul? Yes. (LAUGHING) Uh, uh, what's so funny? Ah, he thinks everything's funny. He's crazy. He's the doctor? (LAUGHING) Excuse me, here... I just expected more from the way she described you. No offense! Mary, who is this? I told you, I'm Andy. I'm her lover. You must be the boyfriend. I can't tell you how relieved I am that you turned out like this. Now look, fella, I can take a joke just as well as the next guy. Uh, Andy, Paul and I just got engaged. I heard! Congratulations! Why, thank you. We're still gonna spend the weekends together, though, aren't we? Don't worry. It's only physical. Now, look! Am I making you angry? Puff once if it's yes. Mary, please, would you... Uh, Paul, I'll call you tomorrow. Andy, uh... Andy, goodbye. Goodbye, Mary. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Bye. Go! Go away. Just a minute, you! You! You, you... You put 'em up! I don't wanna put 'em up! Why? Because I'm chicken, that's why! (IMITATES CHICKEN) (GIRLS LAUGHING) You can't go up there! It's okay. I had a sister. (GASPS) Young man! You may not come upstairs! Get outta my way! Oh! Young man, I'm going to call the police! I'm going to call the police! Uh, Mary's in that room. Oh, you certainly take the shape right outta that towel! (GIRLS LAUGH) (SIGHS) Police will be here soon. Yeah. I really like you, you son-of-a-gun. (LAUGHS) Yeah, I guess you do. You'll probably be expelled for this. I was upset! My girl got engaged to a pipe! Yeah, they'll be satisfied with that. Is that your mother and father? Yes. They'd hate you. I know. What's his name? Willy. Do you love him? Only when it rains. Otherwise, I throw him on the floor. I'm afraid of the rain... And thunder and lightning and most everything else. God, I wish you were sane. If I was sane, would I be in this room? If we got married, when it wasn't raining, would you throw me on the floor? No, if we got married, I'd always be scared. Are your mother and father nuts? No. They were killed in a car crash when I was 12. Don't say you're sorry. Okay, but I am sorry. What if I told you I was driving the other car? I'd say you're so very sad... And so very funny. Which I happen to love. Everybody, I want plenty of energy tonight. Remember, I want it from everybody! Oh, Schmidt! Well, I see they let you out of jail. How did you like it? I think it's very nice that criminals have a place to go. Yes, I'm surprised they didn't expel you. They don't expel you for being in love. (DRUM ROLL PLAYING) My country, I fear, grows weary of me. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Say the line! ANDY: My lord... Death. Yes. Death! Death... Would be an honor. Look at that, one line! He's making a production of one line! If death... Were serving you! (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) Thank God. He's finished. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) (GRUNTS) (LAUGHING) I am killed! (APPLAUSE) Thank you! (APPLAUSE) Oh. What a night! First I kill 'em at the play, and now this. Mmm-mmm-mmm! Every night I go to bed and pray that I won't be in love with you the next day. Did you know that? Sure. God told me. Forget it. You're hooked. Yeah, I guess we're both in love with the same person. Isn't that wonderful? It's terrific. Andy? Hmm? Have you ever noticed that you've never said that you love me? I came to this motel with you. What do you want? You're not laughing. Of course I love you, you old son-of-a-gun! As much as you love yourself? Well, in a different way. It's apples and oranges. You don't laugh much when you're naked, do you? (CHUCKLES) I feel undressed when I'm naked. I see. Mary, I was great on stage tonight. I was, wasn't I? Yes, you were great. You almost ruined the play, but, uh, you were great. Did you hear that crowd? That's what it's all about, getting that crowd to love you. They didn't want to see that lousy play. They wanted to laugh. Mary, I can make 'em laugh. I can make 'em laugh! I can make 'em do anything I want. You'll never know how that feels. What about the play you almost ruined? In a month, we'll be in New York. We? We'll get married, okay? Okay. There's Broadway, movies, television. I bet I'll be working two weeks after we get to New York. Mary, we'll be great! Have I told you I love you? Oh, God. Why him? (MOUTHING) (KNOCK ON DOOR) Mary! Hi, Mom. Hi, Daddy. Hi, honey. Oh, and you must be Andy. Mom! Mom! May I call you Mom? Well, uh... Mom! And you must be Dad! Dad! It's nice to meet you. You can call me Tom. Tom and Mom. I really like that. I really do! And you must be brother, huh? Huh? Yes, Andy, this is my brother, Sherman. Sherman? Really? Sherman? (LAUGHS) I had a hamster named Sherman. Sherman was my father's name, may he rest in peace. Oh, of course, of course. Death is such a terrible tragedy. I mean, my Sherman died, too. I don't mean to compare the two, I... Uh, well, you were a little late, so dinner is ready. Mom, Tom, let's eat! What's on? Let's put our cards on the table. You look at me and you wonder, what kind of life is your daughter gonna lead, hmm? Yes, that's right. To be blunt. Yes. Let's be blunt. Let's bring it out. Let's talk about it. Now, you're worried that Mary is gonna end up starving in some rat-infested garret in New York. Or turning to alcohol. Or possibly prostitution. Oh, Andy! Yeah? We don't even think things like that! ANDY: Mom, you don't have to. Because your daughter is marrying a person who is going to take very good care of her! I happen to be wonderfully gifted! Watch this. (DISH RATTLES) Excuse me. (IMITATING JAMES CAGNEY) You dirty, dirty rat. You've got my sister. You've got my mother. That's great! Wait until I'm finished, Sherman. First time the kid talks, right in the middle of my act! Where was I? "You got my mother." Thanks. (CONTINUES IMITATING) You got my mother... But you ain't gonna get me! Top of the world, Ma. Ma, oh! (IMITATES GUNFIRE) They got me! (IMITATES GUNFIRE) (CRASH) Uh, Andy, uh, could... If we could just, you know, please eat now. You sounded just like him. Yeah, watch this, Ma. Watch this! You're gonna love it! (IMITATING PETER LORRE) Those eyes... They keep winking and blinking. Peter Lorre! Good, Sherman. (CONTINUES IMITATING) Winking and blinking. I have to kill myself. That's what I must do. (CHOKING) Oh! Oh! Are you crazy? I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. I mean, you know, it's only my mother and father. Are we still getting married? We have to. I'm too embarrassed to have you as a date. Closet. Kitchen. Bed. Oh, Mary! Mary. This is New York! We're here! The, uh... Window doesn't open. A lot of people break it. This is perfect! This is where it'll all start! Andy Schmidt's my name. Oh? My name is, uh, Dominic Manza. Uh, the reason he told you his name is 'cause he's gonna be a big star in this town. I'm pleased. And the bathroom's down the hall. You'll be sharing it with 5 other stars. Great. Dom, thank you. Why don't you go buy yourself a cigar? Bye-bye. (DOOR CLOSES) ANDY: Times Square, Sardi's, Lindy's... We're close to all of 'em! Oh! Is this my town? Is this my town? Do I love it? I love it! I love New York! Me, too. Oh, me, too! I know that you're scared now, but just wait. Trust me? Yeah. Yeah. Let's eat in New York, huh? Oh, my God! It's Sardi's! No, no, Sardi's! All the great actors eat in Sardi's! It looks very expensive, Andy. We should definitely eat there. Hold it! (TIRES SCREECH) (HORN BLARES) Hold it. The captain will take your order, sir. Thank you. Thank you very much. Jack! Hi, Martin. Did you know that Jack is here? What're you doing? Susie, love ya. You don't know anyone. They don't know that. Hi, Mildred. (LAUGHS) Andy, um, why don't we just order, uh, a piece of cake and some coffee? I mean, we only have $600 to our name. Do you know that we are sitting right under Eddie Cantor's picture? Someday... I know. And some kid from Ohio will be sitting right here. I know. You know, all those years when I daydreamed by myself? It's so much better with you. Thank you. 'Cause now, when I stop daydreaming, I'm not by myself. Oh, we're terrific! My problems are your problems now. I love that! What about my problems? Oh, for the first 20 years, we'll do my problems. I have to go to the bathroom. Remember that. First time I peed in New York City was at Sardi's. That's great for the biography. Very good to see you again! Yes, indeed. Ha! (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hello? Mom, I told you not to call me here! Mom, I'm fine! I want you to stop saying that. Uh, Mrs. Schmidt? Is that a personal call? Oh, no. No, it isn't. Mom, I can't talk now. Six months is nothing to get a job as an actor! No! Andy never gets discouraged. Mom, stop crying! (SOBS) Mom, please stop crying! I'm very happy! Aw, Mom! Um, Mrs. Schmidt, is that a personal call? No. Could I...could I just have some privacy? The woman's crying. To me, that's personal. Mom, please, don't worry. We're fine! I love him, you know? (CLOCK TICKING) ANDY: Are you asleep? No. You sure? I'm positive. I wouldn't dream this. Yeah. Isn't it great? We're young, we're starving, we're living in filth. I never read about anyone that made it that didn't have this first. It's very nice. How long does it usually last? You're scared, huh? Who, me? (SIGHS) Yeah. How come you never get scared? I see that I'm so close to so many jobs. It's just a matter of days. Oh. What are you scared of? That I'll lose you. Never. But never! Hmm? (SIGHS) I'm also scared that I'll stay with you. (LAUGHS) And I'm pregnant. With a kid? Yep. Oh, my God! Does it hurt? Well, you want me to get you a chair? A glass of water? Andy? Yeah? Listen. I mean, it's gonna be the most normal thing that you and I've ever done. Hello. (KISSING) May I help you? (IN THICK ITALIAN ACCENT) Buongiorno. I am Roberto Capellini. I've come here to see Michael Schuyler, you know? Now we must do it very rapidly, please, because I must take a plane to Roma. Subito! Subito. Ah, yes. Mr. Capellini, do you have an appointment? How dare you? I bite my thumb at you! Now, please, I have no time for this. You buzz the buzzer, I go into the room. Here I go. Okay. Uh, yes, wait just a moment, please. Lucy, is Mr. Schuyler expecting a Mr. Capellini? (BANGS ON DESK) No one expects me! When I walk into their office, how do they say in your country, they are overjoyed! I'm very sorry. He's in a meeting. He will not see the great Roberto Capellini? Then will he see (AS ANDY) Andy Schmidt? The one and only? (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) Funny, huh? Look, I'm a very talented actor! Except that I'm starving! My pants don't fit anymore! I call Michael Schuyler about 20 times a day. He's always in a meeting! Look, I'll see what I can do. Yes! Thanks! His secretary's away from her desk. I'll wait. Hi, Doris. Hi, Milton. I'd like to see Mike Schuyler, please. I take it you're in radio. Tell him where I hit. Don't mess with him. Milton, you need an appointment. You know I'd do anything I could for you. You feel anything? (LAUGHS) Oh, you actors! I have a coffee table at home that isn't dating anyone. You're getting me steamed! Let me try Mr. Schuyler's office again. Yeah, and remember who came here first. You know, you're the spitting image of my cousin. He's almost toilet trained. Mr. Schuyler can't see either of you today. ANDY: Thanks a lot. Hey! You want a cup of coffee? Who's talking? Oh. We get to know each other. You're funny. (SIGHS) I'm sorry about the short jokes. Thank you. I'm very sensitive, actually. There is a lot more to me than being a midget. Where is it? I'm sorry, uh, let's have that cup of coffee, Milton. I'm on to some very big things. Josh Logan, called me up. Uh, Kazan likes me very much. It's all gonna happen in a matter of days. My career is in the shithouse, too. You're very perceptive. I'm a very good actor. All I need is a break. Well, maybe someday they'll do "Death of a Short Salesman". Don't get sensitive. I'm starving, too. You have to be crazy to be in this business! Do you know, sometimes I think, why do I have to be so talented? You? I always think that. I mean, why couldn't I be a barber, huh? Why couldn't I be a dentist? No, I've gotta be incredibly gifted! It's a curse! You? What about me? You think my wife wants this? Do you know what it's like to love a woman and hurt her every day? Oh, sure, I've got a million of them. She is so great! They're all great. This one's greater. She laughs at the right times. You know what I mean? And I have her living in some crappy hotel room. It's not fair. I'm the one who can't get a job. Life is shit! Hmm. Want another cup of coffee? Hmm? No. I've gotta go soon. Where? In the middle of the afternoon? You got a girl? No, not until 5:00, and then, possibly at 8:00. I get laid an amazing amount of times. An audition. Milton, if there's work, if it's a part, I can play short. I gotta see a guy about wrestling. I wrestle sometimes. You wrestle? Really? I'm a novelty. God, what people won't do in this business. It's not so bad. You make a couple of bucks. You get to dress up in all kind of crazy costume. The crowds go nuts. You get to dress up in crazy costumes and the crowd goes nuts? Forget it. You're too little. How does that feel? Hello, Milton. Who are you? Andy... I'm thrilled! What do you want, Milton? I'm busy. Sidney, I just passed by to see... Look, jerk, I told you I'd call you if I got you a match! Why is it every time I look at you I want a shrimp cocktail? No offense. Go stand in the wastebasket. Who are you? A non-talking schmuck walks in with a midget! Andy Schmidt, I... Who cares? You're too little! We got ushers bigger than you! Leave. I gotta take a crap. Ah, actually, I'm an actor. I can do anything. Can you walk outta here? You know, you're not a bad-lookin' kid. You a fagala? Uh, no. I gotta kid at home, you mention fagalas, a real fruitcake, this kid. We wanted a boy, we came close. I love him like a daughter, this kid. So you wanna wrestle, huh? Sidney, he could be fantastic! He's funny. Look at this! Sneezy has an opinion! Milton, when I wanna hear from you, I'll look down, huh? You could mail him to St. Louis for under a dollar. You got a nice face, kid. Grandmother's like a nice face. I'm sorry about your body. Milton, hit me in the stomach. That's not where he hits. ANDY: Watch this. I wanna show you something. Hit me. Come on. (MOANING) (GROANING) Oh! You see what a good actor can do with pain? So far you're doing constipation. I'll say this for ya, you're crazy enough. He could be like David fighting Goliath! Great idea, Milton! (LAUGHS) Why don't you take three months off and change a light bulb? I been doing David and Goliath for 20 years! I'm up to my ass in slingshots. Maybe I'll think of something for you. You're not a bad-lookin' kid. Have you ever wrestled before? Lie. Yes, uh, in college intramural. That's enough! I could teach him. You do that, Milton. Are you still getting laid six times a day? I do my best. (CHUCKLES) If his legs were as big as his schlong, he'd be playing basketball. Leave me your number, Schmidt, I'll call you. Uh, yeah, yes! Yes. You sure you're not a fagala? I, I'm pos... I'm sure. My son, talk about fruits, I bought him a football, and he decorated it. Get outta my office! (HEAVY BREATHING) 32, 33... What is this sudden interest in exercising? You can never be in too good a shape for the theater. 39, 40, 41, 47... Hell with it, that's 50. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Oh, I hope the baby looks like me. No offense. (CHUCKLES) Andy? Hmm? Um, I've got something to tell you. Yeah? I um, I spoke to my father today, and, uh, well... Mary, I can't see my body. Oh. Thanks. I spoke to my father, and I asked him to, um, to send us a little money, you know, just to... Why'd you do that? To tide us over! That makes me furious! Could I see your furious look, please? You don't think I can support this family! Of course I do. It's just that, um, it's just that, you...you know, you never make any money. I mean, I used to give money to families like us. Very funny. Oh, Andy, look, I'm sorry! I know we're gonna have lots of money. It's just with the baby coming and everything. I was going to surprise you. You see, I've taken a part-time job. What kind of job? A very famous photographer asked me to assist him. MARY: Oh, well, won't that interfere with, you know, your interviewing for acting jobs? ANDY: No, uh, he needs me at night... Once, twice a week, tops. (GROANS) All right! All right! Ow! Ow! Okay, again. (GROANS) Pain. Pain. I got that. Pain. Go for big pain. Don't do anything against the rules. That's what he does. Uh, Indian Joe? Hi. Uh, Andy. I... I'm gonna wrestle against you. (GROWLS) What the hell is that? He's a real Indian! He does not like white people. He knows not to really hurt me, doesn't he? Don't worry. Nobody gets hurt. Just remember, pain! Pain. Where's the Indian? If that son of a bitch didn't show up... He's in the john. Why can't he piss before he gets here? Schmidt! You okay? Pain. You look great! Are you kidding? There is a building in there taking a leak! Now, listen, Schmidt. You're good. He's bad. You're an actor. You act. Act good. Okay? Okay. Listen, uh, let me ask you a question. He knows not to really hurt me, doesn't he? Don't worry! It's easier to do pain if you have some! How's the kid, Joe? (GROWLS) Great! Okay, boys, five minutes. Sir? This is my first bout. (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) Um, my wife is, is having a baby. (GROWLS) I'm glad you understand. Geez! (CHEERING) (CROWD BOOING) Ladies and gentlemen, two out of three falls. In this corner, a man who comes to us from the Cherokee tribe of Indians! A dirty fighter, Indian Joe! (CROWD CHEERING) (WHOOPING) Holy shit, that guy's an animal! ANNOUNCER: And in this corner, a man who personally annihilated an entire Nazi regiment during the war. A great American kid. (CROWD APPLAUDING) An all-around war hero. Captain Andy Smith! (CROWD CHEERING) (BELL RINGING) Places! ANNOUNCER: Sir? I don't wanna see anything dirty. No instruments. Don't start putting anything in his eye. Okay, I wanna search you two fellows. Open your robe. See? Just what I mean! (CROWD CLAMORING) (BELL RINGING) Come back! Okay, back to your corners, take your robes off, and come out wrestling. (BELL RINGS) (BELL RINGS) (INDIAN JOE WHOOPING) (CROWD BOOING) Ow! Ow! I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Ow! Ow! Ow! That hurts! That hurts! Does he know this is just for fun? Indian Joe has a lot of pride. Aah! (GROANS) Aah! He's biting me! He's biting me! Good pain. (CROWD SHOUTING) Ohh! (MOANING) (WHOOPING) (GRUNTS) (MOANS SOFTLY) (GROANS SOFTLY) Ohh. Is that you, Andy? Hi! How was the photography? It's tough. Whew! I missed you. Yeah? Go to sleep, sweetheart. Rub my back, will you? Oh, I'm so tired. (GROANS) Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Don't touch me! Andy, were you hit by a car? No, by an Indian. I'll explain the whole thing tomorrow. You're gonna explain tomorrow that you were beaten by an Indian? No, thanks. You'll tell me now. I mean, should you be in a hospital? The hospital released me. See, it... It's not as bad as it looks. Just forget you saw me. Andy, tell me what happened. Oh, please, tomorrow. I'll hug you! I'll talk! I'll talk. I'm talking. MAN: Uh, Mr. Schmidt, you can, uh, read the priest. Agatha, you read Christy. Knock, knock, knock. We understand that there's no door there, Mr. Schmidt. Oh, there is to me, sir. I'm an actor. As a matter of fact, it needs a paint job. (SCOFFS) Would you read already? Father, I must speak to you about my husband. I know I shouldn't, but I must! "Yes, my child, I will try to help." But understand, this is no spiritual first aid station. I know that you... MAN: Spiritual first aid station? That's not in the script. No, it is not, but I see this man as a street priest. You know what I mean? I say, let's let him live! I think that I can make him into a man and a priest. As a matter of fact, in the third act, I think he should start to drink, perhaps slug a bishop. I think we should go all the way with this! The author is sitting right here. He doesn't feel that way. I love your play, sir. Very good work. Very, very nice. But, uh, even Shakespeare had to rewrite. MAN: Thank you. Get off the stage. I could be wrong! That's all, Schmidt. Agatha, we'll call you. Do you have my number? Oh, yes, Schmidt, we have your number. Hi. Sidney, I need help. You need help? There's not a rest room in the country that'll accept my son. Yeah, um... I need money. My wife is pregnant. Boy or girl, I got hand-me-downs for you. I have to wrestle again. Twenty bucks, just like before. Sidney, I'm not talking about 20 bucks. I'm talking about an idea! What if I tell you that I have a guaranteed money-maker? Then I'd make money, guaranteed. What about me? First let's hear your idea, then we'll talk. You actors are all the same. What's your idea? (BELL RINGS) And in this corner, Dr. Andrew Weisel. (CROWD BOOING) A good, clean bout. Dr. Weisel, don't try any of your powers here tonight. What powers? And I want no gouging, and I want no kicking. He's a hypnotist! That's not fair! He's should be thrown out of the ring! Somebody do something! He's a hypnotist! There! He's using it! I bet 30 bucks! Throw him out! (WOMAN CONTINUES SHOUTING) (CROWD BOOING) Throw him out, the dirty bum! (CROWD BOOING) One, two, three! (BELL RINGS) (IN GERMAN ACCENT) Dr. Weisel is the greatest wrestler in the world! Say it. Dr. Weisel is the greatest wrestler in the world. You heard it. (BOOING) What'd I tell you, Sidney? What did I tell you? You did okay, kid. Okay? Listen to that crowd! They really hate me! We're on our way! He was fantastic, Sidney! (LAUGHING) You really killed them, Andy! Dr. Weisel? Yeah? Can I have your autograph? Well, sure, I mean, you know, I... I'm here. My absolute pleasure. Yeah. You really got something, kid. Yeah, I seen 'em all. You're going places. I got all the stars in that book! Thank you. Thank you. Here, you want Cary Grant? Yeah! Now you got it. Get outta here. Well, Uncle Sid? You did okay out there, kid. Did you hear what that man said? He has all the stars in that book. All the stars! I told you he would be fantastic! Yes, you did, Milton. Oh, kid! This time we did it! Oh, Mary! Hi, Mom. Hi, Daddy. Mary. Let me look at you. Oh, it won't be long now. You look wonderful. MARY: Well, I... I've never felt better! Oh, thank you! Is this your, uh... Total living area? Uh, yes. Well, you see, we really don't need that much room until the baby comes. Well, why don't you two just sit down? Andy will be right back. He just went down the street to pick up some food. He's really so excited about seeing you. Mary! Oh, Mom, I'm fine. Really! We want you to be happy. That's all. You can have your New York. Everybody's got his hand out. The big cities frighten me. Everyone's a stranger. But you and Andy are young. Well, I used to get frightened. Sometimes I miss home, but, uh, really, uh, New York is fun when you live here. Not for me. Ahem! Um... How is Andy? Oh, fine. Just fine. He's, uh, taken some other jobs while he looks for work as an actor. How is Sherman? What kind of jobs? He wrestles. Dad, would you like some coffee? What did you say? What? She said... He wrestles. Wrestles? Uh, what do you mean? I mean, he wrestles. Dear God. Nobody wrestles! You mean they pay him to wrestle? (DOOR OPENS) ANDY: Hi! Mom! Oh, heh, darling. Tom! Welcome to New York! Mary just told us that you're wrestling. Yeah! We're thrilled to hear that you've finally found a profession. It's only temporary, Tom. I'm on to some really major things. We've heard that before. (SCOFFS) How supportive of you. Is he always this much fun at home? Huh? Now look, young man. Yeah. Yes, sir. Pa, please, I am pregnant. I mean, couldn't we just all try and get along? (TELEPHONE RINGING) Yeah, you know, Mary, you're right. Mary is right. Tom, we shouldn't fight all the time! I'm gonna make a concentrated effort, huh? Hello! Sidney! You're downstairs. You're all downstairs! No, no, no, if it's such a big deal, come on up! No, nobody's here. Just a figure of speech, Tom. Right, Sidney. Okay. Some of my business associates are coming up. TOM: Who are these people? Uh... I don't know. I've never met any of the people Andy works with. Um... Well, should I set some more places? Do we have enough food? Mom, it's just a small business meeting. Don't worry yourself. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) You're gonna really like these guys! Where's the crapper? Uh, down the hall. Oh, my dear God! You live here? I didn't know you could rent a room here for more than an hour. I'll meet everybody when I get out of the crapper. Oh, come on in. Come on in. Milton Miller and The Elephant, I want you to meet my wife, Mary, and her parents, the Crawfords. This one's The Elephant. Well, hello! Well, would you like to sit down? Maybe you'd like something to eat. I think we have enough. Oh, we ate. You have nice eyes. (LAUGHS) Thank you. ANDY: Milton. Do you two, um... Wrestle? Oh, yeah! Uh, but not each other. I'm too big. (LAUGHS) Oh. Well, let's sit down, shall we? ANDY: So, uh... Why do I have to talk to Sidney this afternoon? Oh, good news. He'll tell you when he gets out of the bathroom. Uh, he has bowel movement troubles. Uh... Oh. (MOUTHING) Do you like New York? Yes, uh... We're from Ohio. Hmm. There are things you can get here that you cannot get anywhere else. ANDY: Milton... Is also an actor. How long are you gonna be in town? Just today. That's enough. Hi, I'm Sidney Seltzer. Yeah, Sidney, uh, let me introduce you to my wife Mary and her mother and father Mr. and Mrs. Crawford. They're from Ohio. That's exciting. Kid, you got a minute? Something big has come up. Oh, sure. We can go in the hallway. Jesus, is this place a dump! Nice meeting you. If you're ever in New York, give me a call. Excuse me, uh, do you have anything more crispy, uh, like peanuts? Oh, yeah. Uh, what do you do for a living? Insurance. Insurance? Do you know Gorilla Gotleib? I'm afraid not. Oh, Gorilla was his wrestling name. Phil is his insurance name. He sells insurance, too. TOM: That's interesting. ELEPHANT: Insurance must be easy. Gorilla was not real smart. Fact is, he's one of the dumbest guys I ever met. Uh, I don't mean to incur that you're dumb, too. (SOBS) Mom! What's the matter? (SOBS) I want to go home. I want to go home! Oh! (SOBBING) TOM: Muriel, what's the matter? Okay, so Milton made a pass at your mother. And Sidney offered me a tour. But first of all, I'm not taking the tour because I wouldn't leave you. And I'll talk to Milton. About his taste. It's all so ugly. Honey, those are the guys in wrestling. I'm through with that! No, you're not. You want the circus. You want the freaks. You'll take the ugliness! The freaks like you! Mary, I had to make some god damn money! Do you mind? Yes! Whoever this is, I want it to be able to stand the craziness out there by knowing that when it comes back to us, it's nice, it's normal, it's home! Milton happens to be a very nice person. He can't be respectable. He's too short. Now stop being such a god damn snob, or you'll wind up in some small town with a picture of Jesus on the wall! I'm going home. Put one thing in that suitcase, we get a divorce! That's good, you little bitch! It gets hot and you gotta take a powder! Get out! We haven't paid for that yet. (CRASHING) Look what I have to do around here. Please. Stop packing. I am through with wrestling. And if I don't get an acting job in three months, I'll get a regular job. And... I love you. Stay right where you are, both of you. Here. Throw this on the floor. It'll make you feel much better. Thank God all we have is junk. I mean, rich people can't do this, you know. So I told my wife that I wouldn't go. I can't take the tour. Kid, you got a nice wife. I know that. But how does she know what goes on inside somebody like you? There're two kind of people, kid! The kind who put lamp shades on lamps, and the kind that put lamp shades on their heads! She wants to be married. You want to dress up like a cowboy and make fun. Sidney, would you look from my point of view? Look? You look! I'm in the business of crazy. I know crazy when I see it. That's you, kid! You don't wanna dance unless your mother's watching. Take the tour! Sidney, I am an actor! Oh, yeah? Then how come you're not acting? So? They let 10 actors act. All the rest of them drink coffee and grow pimples. An actor propositioned my son! I can't take the tour! Maybe he'll grow out of it, the little faggot. Sidney! Take the tour! No. I don't wanna take the tour. But you're a very nice guy. I'm a bloodsucker! You're good, and I want you! We leave tomorrow morning. If you change your mind, call me! We'll play to over a million people! Mary? You're leaving, aren't you? Yes. I'm doing the wrong thing. Can I make you some coffee? No. I left $200 on the bureau for you. Just take it and go back to Ohio, and then I'll call you there tonight. Right. You know, when this tour is over, the whole thing'll be outta my system. Aren't you gonna ask me to stay? No. I'm just gonna ask you to take real good care of yourself. Knock 'em dead. You know, I used to think that all talented people were in show business. I was wrong. Boy, are you talented. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) ANNOUNCER: On my left, that great American fighting man, Leatherneck Joe Brady! (BELL RINGS) And on my right, from Dusseldorf, Germany... (BOOING) Adolf Hitner! (BELL RINGS) Now, Hitner is spelled with an "N", folks. But we know who he takes after, don't we? (BOOING) And personally, I'm offended! (IN GERMAN ACCENT) I tell you something! I tell you something! This is not fair! I want the name of everybody out there that is booing me! (BOOING CONTINUES) I will not forget you! No, I won't! Yes, and I... You, old lady with the glasses! (BELL RINGING) I want his name! Milton, get his name! The referee, looks like "Flash" Wally Rowe! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Take that hat off and come out wrestling. (WELLING) (CROWD BOOING) (TRAIN WHISTLE) You little shit. You hit me in the nuts one more time, and I'm gonna kill you! That's where I hit! Hello, Mary! Yeah, I'm fine. I'm in Des Moines, Iowa. Yeah. No, I... Mary, I'm just trying to earn a living like anybody else! ANDY: Are you married? WAITER: Yeah. When your wife was having the babies, did you ever go somewhere else and wrestle? No. God damn right, no! Listen, just take the rest of the week off, okay? Just take the rest of the week off and be with your wife. A wife is someone that you're not supposed to leave from. I'm in Kansas City with a dwarf and a drunk. I wish I could love somebody the way you love Mary. Milton... Don't love anybody. Not in this business. (CHUCKLES) The circus came to town. You know what that means? Huh? It means the circus left another town. You would have made a great midget. You're sad enough. ANDY: Everything I want louses up every other thing I want. You understand what I mean? Mmm-hmm. Look at this, the midget understands. You two ain't any smarter or sadder here than you were in New York. I'm going to my room. By the way, you don't get what you want, you get what you deserve. Go to sleep. Nobody ever said anything in Kansas City that was important. I've always wanted people I don't even know to love me. I don't even like the people I want to love me. All those dopes! Quit the tour. Go home. Let the dopes love somebody else. That's what freaks are for. You're not a freak. I was hoping to find you here. I saw you wrestle tonight. Hi. Hi. You're sexy and... (CHUCKLES) I'm drunk. Perfect! What's your name? Arlene. (LAUGHING) Are you ready to do things tonight that you never dreamed were possible? I am ready for anything. I hope so. Arlene? Uh-huh? This is Milton. Milton. Handle this. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS) Thanks. (CLATTERING) (CLATTERING) Damn it. (WINDOW SHATTERS) Mary, it's me, Errol Flynn! Why did you break the window? Hi! Because you didn't hear the pebbles. Hi. Why didn't you ring the front doorbell? Because I wanted some time alone with you without the whole family around. How are you? Is that your stomach? Yes, I look terrible! Are you home for good? Yeah. I missed you an awful lot, Andy. Maybe I should come in the house now. Uh, yes, I'll come down and let you in. Good. Uh, Andy? Yeah? Listen. When I get to the front door, you will be there, won't you? Because, I mean, if this is a dream, I will never forgive you! Okay! Andy? Yeah? I'm not gonna touch my hair or anything. So when you see me, just know that I only look like this because it's at night, and you're not around, and I'm pregnant. I mean, otherwise, I am really gorgeous, okay? Okay! Okay. Andy? Yeah? Are you as excited as I am? Will you open the goddamn door? I feel dumb down here without a guitar! Say the word "love." Love. Everywhere I went, people said that word. It only sounds right when you say it. Mmm-mmm. Hi. I'm back. Listen, I just want to apologize for all the trouble that I've caused you. I'll be here in the morning when you wake up, and you'll see that I've changed. I can't undo what I've already done. Oh, but I'm ready to make a new start. Go back to sleep. He's your son. He just did James Cagney wetting. Oh, my God. Look at him. What's his name? Well, we have to name him. Oh, yeah, but he's... He's got 10 little fingers. He's got a nose and a mouth and two eyes and two ears. Can I? Oh, sure. Okay. Come on, come on. Yes. Hello. Hello. Yeah. Oh, we're gonna have so much fun. Are you happy? I could be in Yankee Stadium, and play in front of 80,000 people, I'd never be as happy as I am now. (BABY COOS) Aww. Good. Just some toast. No, Mom. Coffee is fine. I have to be downtown in 20 minutes. You know, Andrew, Tom would kill me if he knew I told you this, but he said that you have the potential to be one of his best salesmen. Well, I'm learning a lot from him. Andy, I thought you might be interested in this. We're starting a community theater. Why would I be interested in that? Well, they would love having you, and you'd be in front of people. Sweetheart, I'm in front of the people I want to be in front of right now. Mom. I've never seen a change in a boy like that. Yeah. It sure happened fast. (SPEAKING GIBBERISH) That's an old proverb, and I don't believe in it. This guy is funny. Did you ever meet him? No. I like Milton Berle. He's so funny. (IMITATING MILTON BERLE) "What the hey? What the hey?" Did you ever meet him? ANDY: No. Jerry Lester? No. I never got a chance to meet anybody. I was in the business for 30 seconds. (SCOFFS) Could we just watch? Why does everyone have to talk? What's the matter with you, honey? Mary's just tired, Andy. TOM: You know, this television is really something. We used to do all our advertising in print. But now, with one commercial on local TV, we can reach 80,000 homes. That makes your job a lot easier, Andy. Mmm-hmm. There's a great western on channel 5. (CROWD SHOUTING ON TV) Hey, Andy, look. They have wrestling on TV every week now. It's really great. Sherman, could you just turn on your god damn western? (CHANNEL CLICKS) Mary, you all right? (INDIAN JOE WHOOPING ON TV) I'm going to bed. (BABY COOS) For Christ's sake, Mary, what's bothering you? A telegram came for you today. A telegram. Gee, I hope my parents didn't die again. Where is it? I burned it. You what? It said there was a spot for you to wrestle on national television. It came from Sidney Seltzer. I don't want, uh, any part of that. Right. The minute you leave, I'm divorcing you. Mary... I'm not leaving. (BABY COOING) Please stay. Have a nice day, Andy. Yeah. See you all tonight. You forgot to pack this! I was gonna call you, Mary. Stop sneaking out of town, Andy. Goodbye! Andy, I... MARY: Mom, shut up! He knows what he's doing! My lawyer will contact your lawyer. Or whatever people do. I just thought in a couple of weeks... Not this time! (TEARFULLY) Hurry up! You'll miss your train! I have to do this, Mary. Andy... Mom, stay out of it! Get out! (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) (LOUD CHEERING) Hi, this is Dennis James at ringside. There's something going on here tonight. You can feel it in your bones! Actually, you can cut it with a knife. The great Buddy Gibson is already in the ring, and he's waiting. And as you can tell, thousands of people here in Madison Square Garden, they're waiting. And the millions of you folks watching this first television hook-up of wrestling, we're waiting for... Well, as a matter of fact, I don't know what we're waiting for. Let me read to you from the avalanche of publicity we've been bombarded with over the past three weeks. Hear this. "He was, and is the wrestling champion of the world. "By divine right." Ah, it's what it says here, folks. Now, also, he, uh, hates violence. He came close to killing five men because he hates violence. "He's a lover of all human beings, hence his name, "The Lover." Now, The Lover. What does The Lover do? He kills you with love, is what he does. This crowd is getting restless here in Madison Square Garden. And speaking of this crowd, it's more like the crowd for a Broadway opening night than for a wrestling match. Look around. You can count the tuxedoes and count the stars. There is something definitely going on here tonight! There's the chant of the hands. Let's see what's gonna happen! (BELL RINGS) Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please! Will everyone be quiet? The Lover will not come out unless there is complete silence! (NOISE DIES DOWN) Thank you. (FANFARE PLAYING) (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Well, if you folks just tuned in, this is not Queen for a Day. This is wrestling from Madison Square Garden, believe it or not, and this is what the well-dressed wrestler will wear this year. DENNIS JAMES: I don't know what he's spraying, whether he's got a bug killer there, flint, or whether that's his own personal cologne. But whatever it is, he's delighting this crowd, I'll tell you that! Well, he's got quite a charisma, this boy. He's got a lot of charisma. That's The Lover! And very agile at getting back into the ring. (BELL RINGING) Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the main event of the evening. Two out of three falls, one hour time limit, for the championship of the world. And your main event referee, former great, U.S. Champion, Count Billy Varga! (BELL RINGS) In this corner on my left, from Washington, D.C., your favorite and mine, the great, undefeated world's champion, Buddy Gibson! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) And his opponent on my right, appearing in America for the first time. Self-proclaimed by divine right as the wrestling champion of the world, The Lover! No biting, no gouging. Go get 'em. You understand? (CROWD CHEERING) Now, that's why they call him The Lover. (BELL RINGS) (LOUD CHEERING) MURIEL: Ohh! Oh, oh! Ohh! Andy, hurry up! I'm coming, Milton, I'm coming! Come on! Tomorrow morning, 10 a.m., Plaza Hotel. I'll give you a press conference. I'll tell you everything! Give him a chance! Hey, where is he? He's getting dressed. Sidney! Hey, kid, I just saw a guy from the Ed Sullivan show! They want you on the 23rd! Everybody wants you! You're a star! ANDY: Say it again! I wanna hear it again! You're a star! Milton, you say it. I wanna hear it with an accent! You're a star! Get your ass out here! Toncio! Aha! How do I look? Unfortunately, like my son. Thank you. (LAUGHING) Here's to you, kid! Thank you. This is worth millions! Oh, God, I feel tall! Here's to your new height! (LAUGHS) You got everything now, kid! Almost everything. Okay, let's go. Mary! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Here's your daddy. Hello. Hello. Yes. (KISSES) Does this mean that you're not mad? Are you kidding? Put down the kid. Miss me? I missed you. I did. Come here. Yeah? That's for leaving town like a bank robber! And that's for being such an asshole to your wife! All right, hold it, hold it, hold it. I don't think that violence is such a good thing for a child to witness. Shut up and take those ridiculous clothes off. And that stupid wig. You're with your wife now! All right. Here are the rules. You do what you have to do. We'll have midgets to dinner. We'll have Indians over for drinks. But when you and I are alone, you're you and I'm me, and Andrew gets to watch two people in love love each other. It'll be good for him. Take off those stupid pants! (LAUGHS) Fur lined! Well, I have to feel the part all the way down. Come here, lover! If there are panties under there, I'm going back to Ohio.
