THE YEAR OF FURY THROUGHOUT THE 20TH CENTURY, URUGUAY WAS A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE OF A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY, BUT IN THE 1970s, IT COULD NOT AVOID MIMICKING THE REACTIONARY MOVEMENTS OF ITS NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. THE YEAR THAT PRECEDED THE COUP D'ÉTAT OF JUNE 1973, THE COUNTRY GRADUALLY SLIPPED TOWARDS TOTALITARIANISM. SPRING 1972 The interrogatee is hooded and completely stripped, then tied up by his hands and feet. An electrical discharge is applied by means of electrodes, choosing the most sensitive parts of the body: breasts or nipples, testicles or vagina, anus, even open wounds. What happened to you, Rojas? You shit your pants over a bunch of long-haired hippies? Are you sure you have the courage to live up to what the country needs right now, yes or no? We're in the town of Manga, where surprisingly in the last elections there was a participation of 107 per cent. That is, there were more votes cast than voters. We're with renowned scientist, Mr. Arsenio Caneloni, expert in paranormal phenomena, who has been studying the city's paranormal activity for months. Tell me, Mr. Caneloni. What conclusions has your research shown? We have detected a high presence of ectoplasm, and auric fields in the polling station, and geometric crop circles next to the dumpster, where the ballots were found. Do you mean then that the extra votes were cast by extraterrestrial forces? Without a doubt. Unidentified Flying Voters? Exactly! You know what you want and how to get it. You like to do things right. That's why you only entrust your skin to Flow. Because Flow with beauty cream makes your skin soft, silky and naturally moist. Flow with beauty cream. Good skin shows how much a woman cares about herself. That's why you need Flow. A father sharing his old porn magazines with his son because he doesn't want him to be seen buying them in case the Education Council finds out and takes away his family's subsidy. Should we go after Sanguinetti's educational project? I like it. Those dumb politicians make it easy for us to laugh at them. But if you stop to think about what's happening in this country, it makes you want to cry. Then don't stop to think. You think the military will dare to shut us down with a hit show? They once dared to shut down Parliament after 150 years of almost uninterrupted success. But don't worry about that now. If the time comes, we'll take our business elsewhere. Excuse me. You're Leonardo Orione, aren't you? I loved your novel. I read it twice. I'm sorry, but you're mistaken. Are you writing another one? -We're all dying to read it. -I told you. You have the wrong person. Want to come up for a drink? Emilia would love to see you. Better not. I think I'm catching a cold. Then I'll see you tomorrow. If you're feeling better. We can work on the script. Okay. -Bye. -Bye. Tell Emilia I'll call her tomorrow. I will. ROOMS FOR RENT Diego, come here. Congratulations. It was amazing. -You watched it? -Of course. We laughed out loud. Every week you guys get sharper. Or you drink more. Knowing Leonardo it wouldn't surprise me. What can I do? It's like ping pong. I have to keep up with him. Sure. Poor thing. You don't like vices, right? He said he'll call you soon. He said that? He's a liar. Seriously. He was going to come up, but he feels a little under the weather. Diego. Did you see I had to put up the rooms for rent sign again? I have no choice but to rent Sergio's room. I can't afford to keep it vacant any longer. You still haven't heard from him? Could you pick up his things and keep them in your room? Undress. The Minister of National Defense confirms the arrest of Tupamaro leaders Raúl Sendic, José Mujica, Eleuterio Fernández Huidrobo and Mauricio Rosencof is a fatal blow to the guerrilla rebels. If you want, I can fix it. I worked as a clockmaker's apprentice for a while. I like fixing them. You don't say! In fact, I like fixing clocks more than writing. Go on, laugh. But clockmaking is an art. It's like being a surgeon. Except that... there's no blood involved and you don't risk anyone's life. And you have to keep your eyes on the tiny parts of the clock the whole time. But writers can't keep their eyes on the paper. We're cursed. I don't envy you either. You can't serve drinks without looking people in the eye. I told my mom to wait a little longer, but she says she can't. Your mom does what she has to. I'm worried, Diego. I heard at school the military doesn't discriminate anymore. They're grabbing anyone with left-wing ideas, or long hair, even if they have nothing to do with the Tupas. You know Sergio. He's a survivor. He always lands on his feet. ID CARD SCHOOL OF JOURNALISM Your umbrella! Leonardo stood you up again? How long will you keep bailing him out? I don't mind working alone. Actually, I prefer it. But he gets all the credit, doesn't he? We write jokes, not "The Iliad". What are you up to? Looking at you. "I was in the neighborhood". Solitude looks good on you. -Does it? -You're more handsome. Really? Yes, you are. Your gaze looks different. You're the pretty one. Too pretty. Thank you. Jenny. This is Fernando. He's the new tenant. -Hi. -Hi. -She's my daughter. -No. You look like sisters. I know, all my friends want to meet her. Stop. Are you Spanish too? No. I was born here. Okay, time to go. You'll be late for class. A kiss. Hi. Tell Aurelia to warm up your dinner. If she hasn't gone to sleep yet. That's okay, I'm not hungry. The barracks are a madhouse, Ceci. Every day more arrests, more interrogations, more paperwork. Until eleven at night? One day after another? I'm working my way up in the war against subversives. Doors that have always been closed are starting to open. I thought that was what you wanted. You know very well what I want. That is only in God's hands. In Chile, General Bravo Muñoz has declared curfew. President Allende warns that the country "is living on the brink of civil war". You don't know what it's like to live in a city like San José. People all think the same, say the same things, the same small life aspirations. Living there is exactly how I imagine hell. You'll find Montevideo small too. Why? Pudahuel International Airport has been temporarily closed, and all radio stations... At this rate we'll all end up thinking the same here too. Look at him showing off. If he keeps smiling so widely, he'll swallow his toothpick, and we'll have to do CPR on him. Your idea of paradise, right? Shut up. I want to get to where he is on my own merits. Go on, laugh. But I earned everything I have. Nobody gave me anything. A group of guerrillas from the National Liberation Movement have been killed on the road from Montevideo to Maldonado at kilometer 112. They had just escaped from Punta Carretas Prison and had been involved in the kidnapping of Ulysses Pereira Reverbel, Carlos Frick Davies and the deputy Homero Fariña. That's a lie! -What's wrong? -These bastards are lying! I knew something was wrong. It wasn't normal that we didn't hear from him. Did you know he was a Tupa? I knew he was a communist and he was political, but a Tupa? And I don't think he was. But there's no way he was involved in those kidnappings, let alone escaped from prison. That's the excuse they use to justify killing them in cold blood. It's okay, sweetie. Open up! Military police! Open up! Open up! Open up! Do you own this guesthouse? Wake up all the guests and bring them out. Can I ask what's happening? You don't read the news? You had a subversive in your house. Or is that common practice? Which one was his room? The second door on the right. Search them all, boys! Let's go! ID. ID! Do you have a search warrant? We didn't know he was a Tupamaro. We thought he was a photographer. We couldn't believe it when we saw him on the news. People come and go, show up and leave. There's no way to know what they do when they walk out that door. He didn't leave anything here? An address, any contact info? Nothing. Move out. Miss. Let's go. -Are you okay? -Yeah, I'm okay. No more jokes about the government or the military! Then who will we laugh at? Nixon, Fidel Castro or Pele, but the government and military are untouchable. Understood? Better forget Nixon too. Here you go, rewrite it. -Did you hear what I said? -Yes, we did. But that's like asking Inspector Clouseau not to be clumsy. The head of the channel called me today. The military are threatening him, and you know very well that they don't mess around. So let me make this very clear: either stop doing skits about the government and military, or the show is over. For you and for everyone. He's right when he says they don't mess around. That night at the guesthouse it was touch and go. Poor Emilia. She escaped from the fascists in Spain, and now they storm her house here. And Sergio... I'd rather not even think about what they must have done to him. In college he was always defending lost causes. But he always had balls. And a big heart. He said he organized a protest when they arrested you. He did it for everyone, not just for me. How long were you in prison? Eight days. Why? I mean... What was the official accusation? They didn't like my classes. Too many foreign books, they said. Really? They thought foreign books were the reason Uruguayan youth has gone astray. Right. Read only national books, stay away from foreign ones. But when it comes to jokes, it's the other way around. This country is surreal. That's it! We'll do surreal skits. Absurd. We'll show how surreal this country is becoming. We'll take everything a little further, to the limit of the absurd, without mentioning anyone in the government. People will understand it all the same. Let's write it right now. We'll do it for Sergio. -Poor kids, so young. -It's horrible. I pray every day someone will find them. They won't find them. They've stopped searching. But don't you remember the sole survivor of that Peruvian flight? The one that crashed two years ago in the Amazon. Well, miracles happen, especially at Christmas. Excuse me. How are you doing, Rojas? Captain. Is your wife happy? Yes. -Thanks for pulling strings. -Enjoy it. You deserve it. A little advice, Rojas. Watch yourself out there. What? Variety is the spice of life. Stay out of trouble. I don't understand, Captain. The prostitute you saw regularly... Luckily we fixed that for you. We cannot tolerate behaviors that may jeopardize the confidentiality of the cleansing operations we're carrying out. You're discreet, a patriot. That's why you were not part of the "solution". But don't push your luck. Keep your life simple, Rojas. Enjoy it. Name: José Salmerón. Arrested on public roads for starting the windshield wiper of his car on a sunny day, and disrespect to the authority. Disrespect why? Did you resist arrest? No, all I did was ask why I can't turn on the windshield wiper even if it's not raining. I'm not hurting anyone. You didn't notice that the movement of the windshield wipers is lateral from side to side, like a pendulum? So? You don't see anything wrong with this movement? No! You don't see that it's negative, subversive, seditious? Seditious? It wasn't a statement. You were demonstrating on a public road in a seditious manner! Brilliant, Diego. You and the novelist outdid yourselves this time. Thank you. It came out easy. Leonardo was particularly lucid last night. Leonardo? Yes. The more you hit him, the more he hits back. He is a little weird, but there's no doubt he's talented. But I never got why he ended up writing jokes for TV after such a successful novel. I guess being put in jail when he was a teacher marked him. Does he ever talk about jail? No. Never. I imagine he had a bad time when he was arrested. But he's not the kind of person who likes to show off his suffering. I'm sorry, dear, but I don't see why you think he's such a saint. He's not very politically active here either. You write most of the scripts. All he does is get drunk and kill time at nightclubs. He even signs with a pseudonym to avoid putting his reputed name behind the cause. -So? -So what? He wants to separate his writing from his work here, and it's ok. Diego, you have a call. It's urgent. Orione? Do you know Enrique Batista? No. College professor, Marxist like you. He was dating one of his students. Apparently he chose to ignore the warnings. He thought the power of the university pulpit would protect him, but no. He continued to indoctrinate his students, until one day he got a call saying his girlfriend was dead. An accident, an unfortunate accident. Poor girl. She was a smart girl, from a good family. I read your novel. Really good. Doctor! Susana Pereira? Diego Barroso? Yes. How is she? I would say miraculously well. She had two bullets lodged in her chest, one by her armpit and one by her lung, so she needed surgery. She's recovering well, under the circumstances. Can I see her? Yes, she's in the ward. But don't stay too long. She has to rest. She's out of danger, but for the baby, the next few hours are crucial. Baby, what baby? She's three months pregnant. I was in love with a guy in Colonia, and he got me pregnant. But he blew me off, so I came to Montevideo and had an abortion. They made such a mess. They told me I could never get pregnant again. So I stayed in Montevideo. You know the rest of the story. That's why I never took any precautions. It's a miracle. It's like God has given me a second chance. This time I'm not going to screw it up. Who shot you? I don't know, but I recognized the car. They were soldiers. They used to take me to a house in the suburbs to see a lieutenant. A very reserved guy, I don't even know his name. I guess he's the one who gave the order. Who knows why? They don't need a reason. They might do it on a whim, for fun. I don't know. There was something weird about him, something dark. He always asked for me, he never wanted to change. Maybe he wanted to kill me so he wouldn't have to want me. SUMMER 1973 Leonardo! Do you think I don't see what you're doing? Do you take me for a moron? Ratings are going up, right? You can stick your ratings up my ass, which is the same place they have their rifle barrels. Rewrite the whole thing. You don't know what it's like to have a rifle barrel up your ass, Almada. You don't know anything. Listen closely, Leonardo. If you don't have the script changed by tomorrow, I'll fire you both. Believe me, I'll be doing you a big favor. Because even though you sign with a pseudonym, they know exactly who you are. Clashes continue between police and protesters, who are staging a public protest outside the Law School against the Boiso Lansa agreement. The police are using force to disperse protesters on the 18 de Julio Avenue and nearby streets, such as Tristán Narvaja, Colonia and Mercedes, where a large group of police is responding with tear gas and numerous arrests for smashing windows and burning tires. Let's remember that through the Boiso Lanza agreement, the government entrusts the armed forces with the mission of providing security throughout the country... RESIST We were all surprised that Raquel married Alfredo, because of the age difference. And many of us thought they wouldn't last. But the truth is, he's been very good for her. Poor man. Of all people, he never got into any trouble. And now they put him in jail. I don't think she would have ever married Leonardo. He's always been a free spirit. He never believed in marriage, conventional life. What? I think it's funny how you buy into all of Leonardo's bullshit. -Bullshit? Why bullshit? -Bullshit, yes! His ranting against marriage and conventional life is only a façade, a mask. Like so many others he wears. Maybe you resent that he fell for Raquel instead of you? I conceded defeat a long time ago. And no, I don't resent him at all. On the contrary, I'm very fond of him. But that doesn't mean I don't see who he really is. And everything he said to Raquel to leave her was total bullshit. The worst of all his novels. Even though he did it with the best intentions. Tell Emilia to keep me posted on how Raquel is doing. If she needs money or... She's going to need friends to lean on. I can't, it wouldn't be right. Emilia went to see her, and Susana is helping out in the shoe store. Good. It must have been hard. I know you left her to protect her. Did Emilia tell you that? What does she know? I don't know. But it's a shame Raquel doesn't know you love her. She doesn't have to know anything. You have a big heart too. Ready! Aim! Fire! THE LAUGH MACHINE -How are you? -Fine. Is your family okay? -Juana, how are you? -Hi. -Everything okay? -Hi, how are you? Are you going to Spain this year? No, with Florence pregnant, we'll stay close. I left some papers at the Jockey Club. I'm an idiot. Take the car, I'll take a taxi. -But we can go later. -No! It's important. Taxi! -Hi. -Hi. Hola. Are you feeling okay? Yes. It's the heat that's killing me. And you? Did you sleep at all last night? Not much. Do you have these in a 38? -I'll check. -I will. Go and get some rest, I'll take care of it. Thanks. I'll look. Okay. I only have a 37. -Do you want to try it on? -Okay. They're too small. Thank you. You don't want to try another pair? No, I like these. Come back next week, we may have more. Okay, thank you. Goodbye. I thought I'd never see you again. What do you want? Are you okay? You don't know what happened to me? I had nothing to do with it. I swear. My name is Germán. Yours? Susana. It was Sergio's. You hid his things in my room so the military wouldn't find them. I knew they would come to search the house. You and him...? Was he really a Tupa? Yes. And you? Well, I'm just a courier. I don't take an active part in the operations. I only carry messages back and forth. But please don't say anything to my mom. Diego. There are ways to help without getting blood on your hands. The country is turning into a prison with three million inhabitants, and you can't look the other way. I only write jokes. So you have a flatulence problem? Yes, I don't know what's wrong with me, but give me something because I'm losing customers. So, tell me. What have you been eating lately? Any legumes, vegetables? Pickles, lots of pickles. I understand. Focus. What's up, Diego? What happened to the script? What happened? Didn't you see? They changed everything! Really? Was it you? Did you sell out? Almada was busting my balls, so I made some tweaks. I don't even know what I did, I was so drunk. What's wrong, it didn't work? Didn't work? Are you fucking with me? What are you doing? Did you cave in too? It's not such a big deal. Cave in. It's just a shitty show, we both know it. It might be a shitty show, but it's our show! How could you change it without telling me? After all the times I've bailed you out when you were drunk! Listen, kid! I've paid my dues. And if you have to bail me out because I'm drunk, you bail me out! That's what the intern does for the lawyer, and the apprentice for the clockmaker. It's always been like that and it always will be. Diego. Stop. Stop. Stop. I should have told you. It was wrong for me not to. I... Forgive me. Come on, darling. Noemi. She speaks English, and I want you to meet her. Naomi. Naomi, voilà. Diego. Diego! I thought you liked brunettes. Come and meet her friend. Don't leave me alone playing with the girls. You're a fucking coward. You want me to get drunk with you and fuck some chicks while we look the other way? It's not a bad plan. Better than ending up in a ditch with a bullet in your head. If Sergio could hear you... Look at you! You don't even write anymore. Lidia was right. Do you sign with a pseudonym because it's a shitty show, or because you're fucking scared shitless? Ever been to Panama? Beautiful country. Beautiful beaches. We had a good time there with the Americans. For them, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile, Argentina, it's all the same thing. Patients who need the same prescription because they all have the same disease. And they might be right. If I were in Chile, I'd be doing the same thing as here. My life wouldn't be much different. But... there are things you can't foresee. Things... that aren't in the manual, you know? Things you're never ready for until you actually do them. You can't tell anyone you're here with me or where you are, or who got you this apartment, got it? You'd endanger my career, your life and mine. This time they won't miss. If you don't make any mistakes, you have nothing to fear. Nothing will happen to you. I'm going to take care of you. I'm not sure it's yours. What's up, Fernando? How are you, Diego? -Hi. -This is Hernán. Hi. And what do you do here? Supposedly. Check incoming and outgoing merchandise. Look, I'll show you. VICTIMS OF REPRESSION RESIST! Did the shoemaker talk? He won't, there's no way. Call Rojas. Let him squeeze him. He went home. But we already tried everything. The guy literally shit his pants, but nobody got a single name. Maybe what he says is true, that he was just passing and stopped to help someone hurt. What brand of shoes does he sell? Italian? Uruguayan, Argentinian? Uruguayan. A small neighborhood store. Let him go, he can keep flying our flag. What are you going to do now? I don't know, try to find a job at a newspaper. Though there aren't many independent papers left. And Leonardo is still doing the show? -Yeah. -What a surprise. The great snake charmer. Everyone falls under his spell. And your mom? Does she still have hopes about Leonardo? I think she had some when Raquel married Alfredo. She thought the circumstances might bring them together. They've always had a good vibe. But for him she was just a shoulder to cry on. I imagine the fact that Raquel was friends with your mother made things more complicated. Yeah, loyalty can get in the way. -You have keys? -Yes. AUTUMN 1973 The government has presented a bill in Parliament declaring a "state of danger", which gives a blank check to the armed forces for repression. Although the government considers that subversion has been militarily defeated, it maintains there are other sources of subversion... Diego. Opposition parties and unions have expressed their rejection of the project... "Marcha" magazine has been banned. What's the excuse this time? The winning novel of a literary contest organized by the newspaper. They say it's subversive. That's ridiculous. So? What do we do? Denounce it? Let's face it, boys. Our days are numbered. So we'd better make the most of them and sharpen our pencils. So I'm a sad and lonely pharmacist, and she's a beautiful customer who wants to weigh herself, but I don't have a scale, and I don't want her to leave. Good day, Miss. How can I help you? Good day. You don't have a scale, right? I don't see one anywhere. -How do you want it? -What do you mean? In kilos or pounds? Dial or digital? Excuse me, Leonardo, did you write this? What a jerk. How dare he ask you that. To go or to use here? We'll need a laugh track for this. Otherwise it will be tough. Who does he think he is? -I could do it stuttering. -He's just a puppet. T-to g-go... or t-to use h-here. I don't know, to add something to it. I told you he was up to something. With all the women at the barracks, he had plenty to choose from. Is he so dumb to think the baby she's expecting is his? If it comes out black... -No one saw you, right? -No. How big. You look beautiful. You didn't tell anyone you were coming here, right? No. What are you doing here? I know you don't understand, but I swear he's a good guy. -Susana, he's in the military. -So what? Don't you realize what they're doing? What if he tortures people? Do you know what that guy does? No, I don't. Only that nobody has ever looked after me like this. And what do you expect from him? He's probably married. -Is he married? -Yes. Susana, you worked the streets, you know better than anyone. Do you want him to leave his wife? No! I don't know what I want. I might go to Colonia with my family, I don't know. It's hard being alone and pregnant. But you're not alone. We'll take care of you! It's not the same. What else do you know about him? He specifically asked me not to tell anyone he got me the apartment or where it is. We'd both be in danger. You see? He's putting himself on the line for me. -Why would he be on the line? -I don't know. Maybe his superiors don't like him always seeing the same woman. They're afraid he might tell me stuff. Stuff, what stuff? You see? He's involved in something ugly. What's his name? Promise me you won't tell anyone. I just want to make inquiries. -Why? -To put my mind at ease. Last time you called me you had two bullets in your chest. I swear he's a good guy. Trust me! What's his name? Susana. -His name. -Germán. -Germán? -Rojas. Es un teniente. Doesn't ring a bell. And we don't have any informants left in the army, so I don't know what I can find out. Plus, that type of information, whether he tortures people or not, they keep it very quiet. They use nicknames. I don't know. But I'll try anyway. Okay. I'm very grateful. I'm very worried. How is she? She looks good. Prettier than ever. But she's scared. CLOSED And now with Hector gone, it's your chance to host the show. Or has Almada picked someone else? No. Hector and Leonardo quitting came as a surprise. Now he has to rethink everything. Have you proposed yourself, or do you just wear shorter skirts? The short skirts are only for you, but lately you don't seem to notice. I have a new job, Lidia. I have to prove my worth. What's the point? -Your paper's days are numbered. -Exactly. We're trying to be more intense, fight to the bitter end. Why don't you jump before the ship sinks, and come back? Almada knows that without your talent or Leonardo's, the show is dead. I could talk to him, tell him you're sorry. But I'm not sorry. Lie to him, who cares? Think of it as just another job. Much less risky than what you're doing now. Who says your name isn't already on a list on some officer's desk? Come on. Think about it. With luck, we could work together. You writing, and me, hosting the show. Come on. Two tickets to Panama. For him and the mistress, baby included. Christ almighty, he's gone nuts! Germán Rojas Salcedo. Lieutenant. Studied at the School of the Americas in Panama. What's the School of the Americas? A center where Americans train Latin American armies in methods of torture and repression. As they call it, the counterinsurgency fight. Being trained to torture doesn't make him a torturer, right? I'm afraid he is. A comrade tortured at the base in Valparaiso recognized him. "Tango Man" they called him, because of the music he plays when he tortures. It's a great opportunity, Diego. For what? To kill him? We'd send a message to society that we're not completely defeated. It would raise morale for people to keep fighting the government. No. I don't want to be a part of something like that. You don't have to. Just give us the address. No. It's the only way to save your friend. He's obsessed with her. Or do you think Tango Man...? Or do you think Tango Man will let her go just like that? They already tried to kill her. Why don't you take Waldo out for a walk? Just around the block. Alfredo. You have to try. Slowly. Not here. Take it. I'll be waiting for you. ROUND TRIP MONTEVIDEO - BUENOS AIRES Come on, Susana. Let's go to the guesthouse. I don't want to. Why don't you want to visit Emilia? Sure I want to see Emilia, I don't feel like going out. The girls want to see you. You're locked up all day. Let's go for a walk. I don't want to, stop. -What's wrong, are you okay? -Yes. Did you find out anything about Germán? No. That's it, isn't it? You did, but you don't want to tell me. -No, I don't know anything. -Tell me. It's not so easy. The military are very careful with this type of information. -You're lying to me. -No, I'm not. -What's wrong? -I don't know. But you're not due for another week. I know. What do I do, take you to the hospital? -Yes. -Yeah? Come on. I have to leave a note for Germán. To the British Hospital. Germán already made arrangements. Okay. Everything went fine. It's a girl. Can I see her? Come with me. Wait! Too many people. Wait for him to come out. We'll wait at the front door. Let's go. Now. Excuse me. Gonzalo Ramirez Street? You see that street? It's just two blocks away. They were following you. Do you recognize them? Why didn't you tell me? It would have jeopardized the operation. Captain. Lieutenant. Is that apartment yours? I'm renting it out. I came to see the tenants, but they're not here. Do you have the keys? I have to go, Captain. My wife is not well, she's in the hospital. By all means, go. With two tickets to Panama, you'll let him go just like that, Captain? He'll go see her before. MATERNITY UNIT I warned you, Lieutenant. What happened? It was you. How could you betray me? What are you doing? What are you doing? Stop! A Tupamaro guerrilla cell was shot by police this evening on Abadie Santos while preparing to attack a military commander in broad daylight. The cell was formed by Fernando Gutiérrez Amaya and Hernán Silva Filippini. Extensive subversive materials have been confiscated at a movie theater in the capital, which has been closed indefinitely. Aurelia, come here! Look how beautiful she is. Gorgeous. Have you heard? I had to tell Mom. It's okay. Come with us. Diego. How is Susana? As far as I know, fine. She had a girl. That won't end well either. We're going to Buenos Aires. I'll take you to the airport. Let's go now. And you? What are you going to do? I can't leave. There's nothing you can do for Susana. I'm still at the newspaper. I'm still fighting. However I can. Diego. Jenny. Let's go. EMILIA'S GUESTHOUSE Do men not listen because women are always complaining, or do women complain because men don't listen? I leave you with the biggest metaphysical question of all. Thank you very much for joining us once again, and I'll see you next week, here on Channel 10, your channel, on "The Laugh Machine". I went back to the hospital the next day. They said she and the baby were gone. They didn't know anything. I asked everywhere. I went to the port, where she used to work. And nothing. I even went to Colonia to see her family. Nobody knew anything. Nobody had seen her again. Then it occurred to me to go to the lieutenant's house. I was suspicious. And I saw the guy... with his wife walking a baby. Don't think it's your fault. Forget it. The military would have killed her anyway, and taken the baby. Make no mistake. I'm sure that was the lieutenant's plan all along. Listen to me. There's nothing you could have done. Nothing. I could have. I could have taken her out of the city. No. It would have made no difference. They would have found her sooner or later. They find a way to know everything. They know how to find your weak spots, how to hit where it hurts most. How to play with your mind, and they don't need to beat the hell out of you to break you inside. They didn't even touch me. I guess because of who I was. They didn't need to. They put me in a cell right next to the torture chamber, wall to wall, and day after day, I heard the screams of the people they tortured. I'd never heard anyone scream like that. On the eighth day, they came to get me. They said that my day had come. They put me in a car and took me away. And I thought that was it. They didn't give a damn that I was well-known, they didn't care. Ready! Aim! Fire! The bullet they really wanted to put deep inside me was the bullet of fear. Hey, I'd like you to come to my apartment for a moment. I want to show you something. If it's a couple of girls, I'll probably say yes today. No, nothing like that. I'm writing. Something I started before they arrested me. I'd like you to take a look at it, and tell me what you think. Sure. Maybe we could go visit Emilia in Buenos Aires. Are you kidding me? She was only blocks away and you never once visited her, and now you want to go to Buenos Aires? Actually, I'd love to see them. See them? In plural? THE COUP D'ÉTAT OF JUNE 27th, 1973, GAVE WAY TO A CIVIC-MILITARY DICTATORSHIP THAT LASTED UNTIL FEBRUARY 1985. IN 1980, THE CIVIC-MILITARY DICTATORSHIP ORGANIZED A REFERENDUM TO CHANGE THE CONSTITUTION OF 1967 AND REPLACE IT WITH ONE ALLOWING THEM TO PERPETUATE THEMSELVES IN POWER. SINCE PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS WERE ILLEGAL, THE "NO" SUPPORTERS SPOKE WITH THEIR WINDSHIELD WIPERS. THE "NO" WON WITH 57 PER CENT OF THE VOTES.
