In the far north of England, in the eastern Lake District mountains, stands Helvellyn - a mighty mountain. Beautiful, romantic in all her ways. She's surrounded by buttresses, crags and screes that fall away. And she's one of the most-visited mountains that we have here. Thousands of people climb her slopes every year to admire the views in all directions. But below and beyond her, she's admired and cared for by a community of people. Wildlife is abundant - by the lakes, in the woods, and in the skies above us. This is truly a place where nature and man work together. The Lake District Ski Club was formed in 1936. That makes us very much a part of the history of skiing in the UK, and also of Lake District life. We're at the head of a remote valley, the Greenside Valley, which has been mined for lead for hundreds of years. And, as a result, a lot of people don't even know we're there. We're not like a ski club resort because of the remoteness. The conditions can be very tricky, very challenging - it can be icy, the mist can come down, you can get white-out blizzards. So you do need to know what you're doing on a mountain and be properly prepared and equipped for a fairly wild environment. The thing about our tow there - it's only a short tow, 360 metres - but it does give access to a wide variety of terrain. You have the opportunity when the snow is good - not like today, unfortunately - to ski right back down to the car park, which is a big descent in some fairly wild terrain. So you can see behind me, you have Catstye Cam - people have skied down that gully there and indeed down the Red Tarn face of Helvellyn. And that's really not something for the faint-hearted. Whoo! So the mountains are about half a billion years old. They were formed at the edge of a collision between two major plates. But what's happened to actually create the distinctive shape of the Lake District with these radial wheels, these spokes of the major valleys coming out, is that the whole of the mountain range was domed upwards by the intrusion of a big lump of granite beneath the whole of the Lake District, possibly pushing the whole of the region up by about 3,000 metres elevation. And then as you dome up that surface just like a cake - as it sort of expands as it gets baked - you start seeing the cracks that come out radially through that cake surface. And that's what creates these amazing valleys that have then been sculpted initially by rivers and streams and then, more recently, by the large glaciers that would have formed here over the last two million years or so. But, of course, one of the ironies about this landscape that we're seeing today is that this isn't how the Lake District should look. The vegetation's completely different because of grazing, but also the deep impact of human-driven climate change has changed the way that this landscape has evolved. We should be seeing glaciers sitting within these valleys now. They should have started forming a few thousand years ago, but they haven't because of our role. And it's likely that we're not going to see that for many tens of thousands of years. This place will become glaciated again - it's inevitable that it will happen. But for us, we've got to enjoy this landscape, because look at it - it is just stunning. You look at Helvellyn up there, covered in snow. This is what mountains look like when we've been children. This is what we want them to look like for the next hundred years or so - certainly in my lifetime. We're in a very fortunate position of being able to walk up a mountain and not have to walk down, thanks to the beauty of these paragliders. The simplest form of flight, really - man's oldest dream. So for me, personally, this is now nearly 30 years to the day when I first flew off this mountain, when I was 19 years old, when I first learnt to fly. I've now taught this sport for the last 30 years. Many people are always saying, "You must be nuts, chucking yourself off here." It's a very safe sport to do. The knowledge is in being smart about the weather, understanding the weather. And here we are now about to jump off over this beautiful Helvellyn vista, to harness the power of the elements and to carry us down into the valley and hopefully land right next to the pub, if all goes well. Good! Working as a fell-top assessor, it's very much focusing on mountain safety, it just takes place in a slightly different environment. We're recording the weather conditions, we're taking photos, we're blogging about it, trying to give people good information so they can go up here and make the decisions themselves. Er, we're getting a couple of big gusts hammering down the mountain, big downdrafts hitting Red Tarn below us, but not as bad as I thought it was going to be. We've had a lot of rain, a lot of snow, a lot of big high winds in the last few days. And then, looking into the bowl, there's a lot of avalanche activity. Multiple avalanche tracks have come down, lots of different areas. I've had quite a wide-ranging outdoor career, all around the world, really. I've been privileged to guide on the big peaks - 8,000m peaks. I spent a lot of time in Antarctica looking after clients down there climbing things like Mount Vinson, skiing to the South Pole. Get that hand over the bottom spike there... All the conditions have come good. And I've got three guests with me doing their sort of introductory winter skills day out with a fell-top assessor, seeing what we do, but also learning how to operate themselves in this environment. So the focus is very much on them making their own decisions, and being able to use crampons, use ice axes to keep themselves safe and make their own decisions. So there's three parts to our fell-top assessor role, really. One, being visible, being a ranger out on the hill, able to chat to people and steer them and offer advice and encouragement - the winter skills side. And then sort of the original role, I guess, if you like, is to come up here and take some observations. So we look at wind speed, maximum wind speed, temperature, absolute temperature, the wind chill, what that will do, the wind direction. And they all get fed back to the Met Office to sort of validate their models. And then we have our own sort of weather line. We put all our reports on there on the internet with photos of the conditions we've experienced that day. And that goes alongside the Met Office specialist mountain forecast. So, hopefully, people have got a really good idea about the environment they're coming into. Just in time for a gust. So it's about 35mph winds at the moment. It's about right. It's just... just buffeting me around a little bit. It's not pushing me towards the edge, which I'm very aware of. We'll just take a reading for a couple of minutes, just gives us a snapshot of what the weather's doing up here around midday. Temperature-wise, down to minus seven. You'd get very cold very quickly if you had a problem, and were forced to sit out in this. And the only other thing I need to do is check the direction of the wind. Everything's a faff in winter, with your gloves on and the wind blowing. I'll do it the pleasant way - wind behind me. Yeah, we've got a west-south-west, which is what was forecast. But it's driving through some big showers and things. But we've got a bit of sunshine at the moment. People always say, "Do you get bored going up the same mountain?" But it's never the same. So I've had everything from crawling to the summit in sort of 70, 80mph winds to... ..yeah, sort of trotting around in my T-shirt on nice, hard, packed-up, icy snow. So, yeah, we see everybody up there - the well-equipped, the ill-equipped, people with eyes out on stalks. Striding and Swirral Edge is one of the classic mountaineering rounds across the country, really. And I never get bored of that circuit. I have been coming to the Lakes for about ten or 12 years, and at first it was just like, what I guess normal people did - just walked. Then I really got into wild camping. I did my first solo wild camp, and I just saw everything in a completely new way. It's the most pure sense of freedom that you can get. And you see the wildlife, you know - the wildlife that comes out is less afraid of you because you almost go one step further - you're no longer just in the landscape, you're actually part of it. You always need to be considerate of where you pitch - well away from roads and people's houses. There is a wild campers' etiquette, which is arrive late, leave early, take out all your rubbish with you. Go to the toilet responsibly. Don't light a campfire. And above all, I have a rule where I say leave a place in a better state than when you found it, because if I see someone else's rubbish, I'll pick that up, too, because I think if we all did that, imagine what an amazing place the fells would be! Well, they said it was going to snow. It's actually raining and my tent's just flapping around and I'm wet. But it's so nice to be inside. I think some people might think I'm mad to come out when the forecast is like that. But it's the best time, because there's no-one else here. So I get the fells all to myself. There's something lovely about hearing that. And being in here. A lot of people ask me how safe it is to go wild camping in the fells. And I always say it's about having the right equipment with you. So, you know, a good tent, a good sleeping bag, a good sleeping mat. Have warm food, hot drinks - more drinks than you think you'll need - something to be able to collect water. And then I think the other thing which actually weighs nothing is knowledge and experience. Weather conditions - as well as camping restrictions - can change, so checking locally for guidelines is advisable. You never stop learning in the fells - it's the ultimate place to teach you anything. And you learn a lot about yourself, as well. So the wind is blowing my tent around quite a bit. I've been having it really pushed close to my nose. Some people feel exposed or unsafe in the dark, but I feel... ..almost protected by it. And I like to go wild camping on my own. And there are people who think that maybe means I'm antisocial, but it's not that. It's... There's just something in me that clicks when I'm in the mountains and everything that I'm worried about or stressed about or thinking about even, just kind of gets shifted completely into perspective. So it's like... ..I'm disconnecting from my busy normal life, but I'm actually truly reconnecting with everything that actually is really important. Well, it's really windy out here. But, erm... It's windy and cold, but it's certainly worth it. The stars are just incredible. And to just know that there's just no-one else around for miles. You know, Helvellyn's this way, we've got some of the villages behind me but... ..it's just me and the stars, and there's something really quite magical about that. I'm fortunate enough to live and work locally to the area, and Helvellyn happens to be one of my favourite mountains. I've spent a huge amount of time up there, whether it's surveying, mountain biking, walking, climbing - it all happens up there. It's a fantastic mountain. The Ordnance Survey was originally set up in 1791 to map part of Scotland for the Jacobite rising when the Scots were approaching on England. The OS historically has had some quite hard challenges to overcome in mapping the UK, and especially areas like the Lake District and in particular Helvellyn. Now back in the day, they had to create trig pillars. Now, from this triangulation, they could start drawing up maps of the UK and continue mapping any new features that started. Now, due to the fact that each trig needed to be seen from another trig point, it involved good weather to be able to do that. Now, that might be the reason why it took 26 years, up until 1961, to finally finish up the trig pillar network. Now the trig on the top of Helvellyn behind me isn't actually on the summit - it's just off to the side. Now that may be because they needed to get a line of sight through to another trig. And the trig on Helvellyn is very memorable for a lot of people around the UK. It's probably featured in thousands of group photographs, thousands of individual photographs, and people see it as a real focal point of their walk. As they see it looming through the mist, as they come up by the Swirral or Striding Edge, they realise they're reaching the final point of their outing for the day. On the top of the old trig pillars, you might often see a bracket placed into the top. Now this is where, back in 1936, many of the OS surveyors used to screw in their theodolite that started the original triangulation of the UK. You may often also find an OS benchmark plate found further down on the trig points around the country. Now these were used as levelling points to level to, back in the day. The technology we're using today is an absolute world apart from what was used back in 1936. So currently we're just checking a couple of levels with my GNSS receiver. Now this is giving me an accuracy of about one to two centimetres. Now, I could just check the levels from our data from the past and update it with any further levels I'm picking up today. Now, with this kit, the OS makes around 20,000 changes every day to our master map of Great Britain. A lot of our data can also be used to create 3D models, and that's really helpful for people to get a better understanding of the area, especially in places like Helvellyn. Helvellyn's a really memorable mountain for me, it actually helped me get my degrees, it's where I did my dissertation and it's also one of the first mountains that my dad took me up as a kid. So it really has a special place in my heart. Welcome to spring in Cumbria. Silliest thing is I brought the sun cream today. Here we go. It's officially spring. This is what I came for. Purple saxifrage. And once you see it, you see it here, there, there. You're in a part of the mountain no-one comes to. For me at least, I think flowers - or wildlife in general - is a personal thing. These flowers, to me, are determination, resilience, coping, making do. And I love to aspire to feel that way. You should be able to find at least a dozen plants up here soon. But purple saxifrage is the first and, for me, it's always going to be the best. It's coping with the worst. It's the best-looking thing up here - myself included. Fantastic little flower. I think the key for me with mountain flowers is these are places people know, but they're not places they necessarily know a lot about - they certainly don't know everything about. So looking for the smaller detail, looking for the fine detail of an area, that's what we're looking for, because these are indicators of what's special about this place. But in terms of the mountain flora of Lakeland, I can start in spring just as the snow is melting. Helvellyn is a fantastic place for that. Come the summertime you're more likely to find me somewhere around Kirkstone Pass and Red Screes. Also around down towards Honister. These are real hot spots for these incredibly rare plants. I think, for me, it's the fact that whoever I bring up here - whether they're the national experts in their field - they look at these things and they've never seen them here before and they're amazed to find out that they're here. And it may be something they've been looking for for years, or it maybe something they've never heard of. And that's the future of conservation. I still think we're suffering loss, we're suffering conflict because we're still finding our way. We succeed by learning from mistakes. It's OK to make the mistakes - it's what you do after that really, really counts. And that's where I think the National Park is now. Around here, they've got to look at what we're going to do for the next 50 years because the rest of it isn't going to matter. It's the future that really, really matters. So my family's been on this farm since the '70s, when my grandad bought the farm. He was farming in west Cumbria before moving here. He retired. None of my parents' generation wanted to take on farming because they were really encouraged not to, because there wasn't... ..we were told no real money in it. So we're aiming to get as much biodiversity as we can on the farm. One of the real goals that we were looking to get was for our cows to be pasture-fed, which were pasture-fed certified. And that means that our cows purely eat grass and pasture or things that we grow on the farm ourselves that are non-human edible. It's definitely not easy, what we're doing. Erm... One of the main reasons is because what we're doing is relatively unpractised in the Lake District. There are other farmers who are doing it and we've got a young daughter, as well. So it's juggling that whole lifestyle of keeping the family going and keeping the farm going and keeping our animals going as well as we can, as well. So one of the issues we found with our sheep enterprise was, firstly, around the economic side of things. In a year of farming sheep under a set stocked system, we made around £600 profit from the sheep enterprise alone. So it didn't really contribute much to the overall running of the farm. That meant that we... When we were looking at that enterprise, we decided, you know, we didn't really need to focus on that. And we thought the cattle had more opportunity. With the cattle, we can let the grass grow a lot longer, which is much better for the cows, but also for wildlife, soil, everything. We can then bunch them up as... ..they would have been in nature. You know, when we had predators, wolves... they would have kept cattle bunched up and moving frequently, which is kind of what we're trying to do with the electric fencing. We took on some fell ponies from Libby Robinson recently, and we've... They're still up in the winter block. The idea is, later in the year when things get a bit longer and drier, we're going to introduce the ponies behind the cows. So if there's anything that's left behind, like little bits of rushes or dock or something, the ponies will come in and just clear it up and then we'll keep moving them behind the cows. The fell pony goes back into the mists of time in the Lake District. The fell pony has not had the publicity. It's not had the kudos of other native breeds of domestic animal like the Herdwick sheep. We know that Beatrix Potter certainly used them and obviously had them for carriage work and using them probably on some of her farms for shepherding, which was before the quad bike. Most shepherds would use a pony to go and see their sheep up on the top of the fells. The fell pony eats on the move, er, it is a... It's not a ruminant like cattle and sheep and deer, who will go in a group. Ponies have small stomachs and very large intestines, which means that they are eating all the time for about 18 hours of the day, small amounts, and they can walk up to 15 miles a day. The fell pony has been here for so long, it has actually acclimatised itself to be able to live and survive in quite hostile upland conditions, constantly picking all the vegetation that they will enjoy eating. They'll eat gorse, they'll eat rushes. These then with their droppings and dung create the soil that's so important to keep up on the fell. So it's important as they use up these wonderful round feet that they have, to trample the vegetation for the spring so that the new grasses and germination of plants and wild flowers will be created. We need to be able to see more of them being used for conservation grazing. And the fell the pony will give that and make it a workable environment for other species. But there are not that many. Doing some research, there's probably only about 200 actual breeding mares that are up on these areas. So there's very few and they need to be encouraged - that we know more about them, know more about what they can do in helping the conservation of the Lake District and giving back that wonderful capacity that they have as part of wildlife. And so to be seen more and appreciated more. I absolutely love the Lake District. It's a place that never fails to inspire me and excite me. Possibly one of the things that many people don't realise is that when they look at these amazing landscapes, they're not just looking at a phenomenal natural landscape - they're also looking at a human landscape. You come into Pooley Bridge and Dunmallard Hill, and on the top of that is an Iron Age enclosure. So it dates from about.. ..2,000 years ago, possibly 3,000 years ago, and obviously if you're at the top of that hill, then you're saying something about yourselves, as well. It's not just about fighting with the tribe next door. What an amazing place to command! I'd live there. So, for example, over there, you've got Askham Fell and that's got more than a hundred Bronze Age monuments - stone circles, alignments, trackways, evidence of hut circles - but it's just an indicator for us of how important and how busy a place this was. This is a place that says as much about history as it does about geology or the natural world. Glenridding now is obviously mostly a tourist town, it's catering for the tourist trade, and most of these little cottages here are holiday cottages that you can rent. But the origins of this village are actually in pretty heavy industry because just further up the valley is the Greenside Mine. It was a lead ore mine, one of the biggest and most important in the country. And it was really extensively worked from about 1825. These cottages - lovely and picturesque holiday lets that they are now - started off as workers' cottages. These ones were built in 1890, and they only got fresh water and an inside loo in the 1950s. After you, Eddie. Right. So we're here now at the Greenside Mine, up the Glenridding Valley, and I'm joined by Eddie Pool, who was one of the last workers to work here while it was still an active mine. Eddie, what was it like? Well, very similar to what it is now. This was the joiner's shop, here. Yeah. See that further bit there? Yeah. All that was a furnace. So how many people were working here? 80 or 90. It's funny, isn't it? Because I think people walking up this footpath to get up to Helvellyn, they might just walk straight past this and not really pay too much attention. Well, they wouldn't really know. All this now is going to be turned into sort of accommodation. The blacksmith shops were in those. I think there was about 13 blacksmiths here at one time. For tool sharpening? Yeah, yeah. Well, tools, sharpening drills and goodness knows what. Wow. What was it like working down the mine? Well, actually, I don't know, nothing. Just talking to you now, met me mate one day, he couldn't recognise who I was. The dust was just so bad. But they all died when they were 50. Do you think because of the conditions? Oh, without any doubt whatsoever. Uh, and they had a terrible bloody death, you know, gasping, gasping. They even had to ask their wives to take the windows out so's they could get more air. It was really a horrible bloody death. Wow. That was where a lot of the work of pushing the ore took place, just in there. Here where the beck is coming down? Yeah. Where... Where that concrete is. Wow. So all that scree, that's all cast-offs from the mining? That's right, right from here, right down to the end of there, look. Wow. Eddie, what level are we at now? Lucy, Lucy level. Right. This is where the mines come, you know, they always brought out. You went into there about a mile and a half and then you went down the shaft, huge shaft, which was about, if I remember right, it was 90 fathom. Wow. And then you went on again to another shaft to 220 fathom. And that was at the bottom of the mine. So you are deep in the mountain massif at that point. Oh, aye, aye. Did it scare you, going that deep? Well, you never thought about it. I mean, other folk had done it most of their lives, you know, and our ancestors did it and everybody did it. And that was it. But there was certainly, every now and again, there was somebody badly hurt, you know, some killed, unfortunately, you know. And as the mine became sort of less commercially viable, did you chaps all know that the writing was on the wall, that things were going to have to change? Yeah. Yeah, we knew, we knew the ledge seam, that had all run out up there. And this one had started, but we knew it was just a matter of time. I read somewhere that the school in Patterdale went from having 100 children to having 20, basically overnight because all the families were moving away. When I was at that school during the war, there was 100 of us, there was 100 South Shields evacuees and there was 50 Czechoslovakian refugees. That was 250. But mind, with what they called the parish rooms, they used them as well. You know. It's funny, isn't it? You kind of look at Glenridding as this little picturesque village in the heart of Lakeland and never changing in this timeless landscape. But, actually, it was a cosmopolitan hub, wasn't it? Well, absolutely. Aye. I think sometimes it's quite easy to dismiss the industrial heritage of the area as being a bit dirty, a bit grubby, something that we should probably cover up in order to let the natural beauty back through. But I think that's absolutely wrong. This is part of the story of this landscape. This mine is part of the story of Helvellyn as a mountain. And, actually, the next time you go to Helvellyn, if you're walking in from the east side, you're stepping over traces of the hidden histories of this place. So walking up along towards Red Tarn, you step over the pipelines that fed hydroelectric power to this place, or if you walk over towards Keppel Cove, that was the site of a disaster in 1927 where a dam broke and released a huge flood of water all the way down the valley into the village of Glenridding. All around us in this landscape are the traces of the people who've come before - whether that's farmers or miners or tourists - and every single one of those people have made a mark on this incredible landscape. And what you see today is the sum total of thousands of years of human endeavour. And that's just one of the reasons that I love this place. Helvellyn and the rest of the fells have inspired countless artists and storytellers. And in the late 1700s, tourists decided they wanted to come and experience this wild landscape for themselves. There were plenty of guidebooks to meet their demand. But most of these were little more than holiday journals describing the same few routes up a limited number of hills. Some of the books even instructed the tourists on how they should admire the scenery. But then came AW, the man who burst the bubble, who started a whole new tradition. Alfred Wainwright focused on the fells and the routes up them. That's not to say that he didn't have similarities with the picturesque movement. And his notes have an air of romanticism, especially when he describes his first book as a love letter to the fells, born out of years of inarticulate worship. But Wainwright alone brought a clarity to the 214 fells that he documented. He didn't do it for money. He didn't even want his name on the book - the first copies of which were sold at the post office here in Patterdale. Wainwright was born in Blackburn on 17th January, in 1907. Like most children back in those days, he was destined for the mills. But Wainwright was a clever boy and did really well at school. He came top in all the subjects. He also loved art and used to do doodling and do cartoons. And he loved reading maps, as well - he'd pore over maps most evenings. So when Wainwright was aged 23, he decided to go to the Lake District for a week's holiday. He'd never seen anything like it - these mountains, and overlooking Windermere and seeing all this greenery. And it changed his life. And that day started his love affair with the Lake District. What makes the Wainwright book so special for me is everything's been done by hand or by pen and ink, that the mountains, you know, just brought to life on the page in 3D on this piece of paper. The amount of attention to detail he put in. And not only that - it's not only that it made the mountains accessible to everybody - it's his philosophical outlook on life and the way he describes things in a poetic way. As you progress through the books, you learn more about Wainwright, his life and his appreciation for the environment and the animals and nature. These are the three holiday at home leaflets - these are very, very rare, these are Wainwright's very own. And I've only seen two sets of these. Maybe someone's got a set in the loft, who knows? But these are very, very rare. There's a Desert Island Discs tape from the BBC, the original tape. Wainwright's photographs. Erm, I've got absolutely piles of newspaper cuttings. Yeah, it's hard to pin down Wainwright's character. He was... He was very obsessed with his work. Whatever he set his task to, he was obsessed. But you've got to also appreciate he was a man of his times. What people also kind of forget is... is how generous he was. There was many acts of generosity throughout his life. He even sold his copyright to the Westmoreland Gazette so he could build a shelter for animal rescue in Cumbria in 1984. It was a man who came from very humble beginnings, who followed a dream and has created these amazing guide books that are his legacy, that all walkers around the world have enjoyed, and will continue to do so for decades to come. I was writing all my notes and descriptions and so on, for the time when I was too old to go on the fells. I found it so wonderful. Never dreamt that there could be a landscape like that, giving pleasure to other people, and quite happy about it. When I first came, if you walked along the street with a rucksack on your back in Keswick or Ambleside, you were an object of curiosity. But of course, once you're out of the valleys, then it's just as it used to be. You can be on your own all day long on the fells. I've got memories now. I live on memories now - not on what I've written in the past. Oh, no! We've done this sort of thing before. You'll manage. You've never lied to me before, David. Why should I start now? Except all those times you lied to me! I'm going to do this on four or five points of contact, is that all right? Five points... Is that acceptable? Five points of contact, is that acceptable? Yeah, yeah. You can jump across there if you want. Me? Yes. OK. Uh, yeah. I'll go this way, I think. OK. Did you jump? Yes. Oh, OK. David, you're showing me up. No, no, no. Showing me up now. Right. There's that memorial. Where are we going now, down there? Yeah. Is this... This is the memorial to the huntsman who fell. Oh, wow. Yeah. You know what? I'm never terribly keen on seeing memorials when I'm on walks to people who've fallen off. Disconcerting, yeah. It just kind of sets with the wrong kind of vibe for me, David. Oh. Is this the best ridge path in the Lake District, do you think? Oh, it's certainly one of them. Yeah. I know Wainwright goes on about it being the grandest. Yeah. The grandest descent of any mountain. The thing is, it's sustained - it's quite long. Do you find that people - when you guide people up here, do you find people lose their nerve? They do, they do. I've had people just take one look at it and turn tail and that was it. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Well, we have done Sharp Edge together. We have. And I can't pre... I have to say, thus far, I'm liking this better. Yes. I'm liking the sense... I don't know whether I'm liking the... It's an interesting route. You have to... You've got to have your wits about you for the route. Whereas Sharp Edge, there was some times when I felt I was just teetering above the abyss. Yes. We used to come to the Lake District every year for our family holiday. Yeah. And I was always fascinated by picture postcards of Striding Edge. Yeah. Fantastic. No, it's the... "Iconic" is an overused word these days, but this genuinely is, isn't it? Yes. I mean, in the setting with the dark, brooding waters of the tarn. The occasional falling fell walker. He said! Now, this is magnificent. You've got to take it in. This is really magnificent mountain scenery, isn't it? We're lucky. And you've got to, like a lot of the Lake District, you need... You can see a lot of it from a car, but you have to make this effort to really get... to really get the proper sense of it. Right. So this is... This is the bad step. OK. Keep three points of contact at all times. OK. Five if you've got them. Well, let's hope it stays at just five. OK. So... OK. There are plenty of footholds and there are plenty of handholds. OK, you... Yeah. You go down a little and then I can... A few handholds, there's good ones everywhere. Got one. Yeah. That's literally the Bad Step, isn't it? That is it, yes. Whoa. We're not quite down yet, but that was the worst of it. There was a certain... There was a certain frisson of stretching my legs over that gap. I don't mind telling you. A certain... I won't say erotic frisson. That's no offence, Dave, but... That's it - done. Is that it? That's it. Striding Edge - done. Really? Yeah. Well done. Hang on. Thank you. Well, thank you, er... Thank you for being such an able guy. Wow! Oh, wow! Hey, that looks worse from below. I feel quite pleased with myself. Good. Oh, man. Yes! Another memorial? Yep. This is the first mountain I was brought up. Really? Yep, my father brought me up here and stood me on top of the trig point - the trig point being 3,118 feet above sea level. Yeah. And with me stood on the top, 3,121 feet above sea level. You topped out at three... Yes. Are you going to do it again? I will try. Come on. I think you can do it. It's, er... It's a bit windy. It was only 20 years ago. Come on. It's my turn to show you the footholds now. Come on. OK? Right, I'm going to stand here. Yeah. Try that. Right. Oh. Can you stand up? Yay! Well done. Yay! Cheers. Oh! You all right? Right. Oh, that's a long time since I last did this. Wow! That's good. Are you all right? Yeah. Well, I'm glad I didn't fall off it. No, I'm glad. That would have... We don't want the David Powell-Thompson memorial up here, as well. But it's wild, it's kind of other-worldly today. It's like the surface of the moon, isn't it? Yeah. And it's just getting worse, isn't it? It is, isn't it? Yeah. That's Swirral Edge. Swirral Edge. In 2014, I was diagnosed with high-functioning bipolar disorder. It was all triggered by my mother passing away. She'd spent about ten years or so being very mentally ill. It sort of triggered this whole series of events that led me to being diagnosed. And for a few years after, I really struggled and I needed to find another way to cope - to cope with being bipolar, with all the ups and downs that come not only with life, but with having a mental illness like that. I got active in the outdoors and I realised that being in the mountains especially just really helped calm me down, because when you're outside, when you're on the summit, everything just seems to fade away. Nothing else matters. For me, it's moments like that that the Lake District, you just... ..you can't get anywhere else and it's really special in the sense that those moments do stay with you forever. Coming to the mountains has definitely improved my mental health and well-being, as well as my physical health and well-being. And for sure, it's a form of medication for me. I've always been an active person, and being outdoors is where I find my battery recharge, as it were. And in 2006, it all came to a head when a truck ran into the back of my car and my life changed dramatically. Housebound for around two years, struggling to see any... any light. Your mind starts playing very, very dark tricks with you. I was clinically diagnosed with severe depression and I was on the verge of suicide and... ..I met this chap and this old man lived around the corner from me, and it was basically as far as I could walk to go and see him. And Max is my miracle dog. He gave me a reason to get out of the house to go and see him. And from that day on, my life changed dramatically. We started cataloguing photographs of Max, and it was more, I suppose, for me to show where I'd been and where I got to. So I could say to people, "Oh, this is how far I walked today," or, "This is where we went today." And it was suggested that Max should have his own Facebook page. I think we're just over the 100,000 followers mark in about three and a half years, four years. And it's incredible because you don't realise the reach that your photograph of the Lake District, where that goes in the world and how it makes people feel. And that's the miracle of them, really, is that they make people smile and they make people happy. This one came along - Paddy. Paddy's been brilliant. He's just a live wire - he's full of fun and full of energy. And he's been superseded by our rather quiet puppy called Harry - Prince Harry of Winterfells. We put Max through a therapy-dog training programme. So he's a registered therapy dog. And we decided that we had something here and we had a vessel for promoting the area, but also for doing valuable work for various charities, including the Search and Rescue Dogs, Mountain Rescue. And from that, we received an invite to the Queen's Garden Party in Buckingham Palace in May. And Max came along with us. We have a lot of military people who will follow us, who have served in Afghanistan or Iraq, and they were coming up to me and telling us what it meant to be reminded of home and... ..how much our little dog had helped them. And I can't repay him for that. Not ever. Helvellyn's just one of them places to me, it's like a... It's like a big playground. It's got a real mixture of everything, you know. Striding Edge, Swirral Edge is quite a tough scramble, but it's a little exposed, you know, and running fast along it, it gives you that little bit of thrill. I like to think of myself as being pretty tough, to be honest. Sometimes the harder it is, I tend to think, the better I do. But I'll prefer it to be a horrible day, to be honest, and I think I'll fare a lot better. I think fell running started for me when I was, you know, 14, 15, and I went from racing on the West Coast or racing around Cumbria, you know, to racing all over the world. Although trail running and mountain running in Europe and all over the world's taken off, in my eyes, it'll never match fell running. Fell running's got a different atmosphere and a camaraderie what isn't in any other sport or fashion of the sport, you know. And I think it's real personal to the Lakes. You know, these are classic races what you'll never get anywhere else in the world. And the Lake District has always sort of bred sort of top-class fell runners. Not that I'm calling myself a top-class fell runner, you know, but you just have to look at the likes of Billy Bland and Joss Naylor and, er, Rob Jebb, you know, that are akin to, you know, Olympic athletes. I have a mini adventure every day. And that keeps me enticed to try different places, different routes, up routes what possibly nobody's ever been on before. I'll maybe never find some, but I can always keep trying. # On the cliff near my home # There's a forest still unknown # I have seen words when I was a child # And inside there's a tree # That gives life to those who seek # But to heal the world I'd give it all away # And I know # I have been searching all my life # Though I haven't found it yet # Until now # I can see it's still there # In the mystic air # When it will be rediscovered one more time... # Well, it's not bad for a little village show. Look at the people who are here today. Generally speaking, they're people who may be on holiday, but they've come and they're recognising the importance. And everything that you're seeing here is about what we say is normal life round here. Farming's changed. And the tragedy is that the local people who know how to run and look after sheep on these fells, they're the ones who are disappearing. Now, a stick like this, it should catch your sheep, but you should also be able to give your dog a twank up the backside. But if you broke your stick on your dog, now that was... That was... That was not done. I dare say that over the time that farmers have been shepherds and using them, one or two will have been broken. Well, I started as a young boy. In those days, there wasn't the things going on in the valleys and the country that there is now. And when it was Patterdale Dog Day was a big day in Patterdale. And I think when I was a young boy, there was only three cars in the village. Now there's three cars outside some of the houses! It's all changed - not everything for the better, but a lot of it is. As I said before, working up here, I've worked dogs all my life. It's going along, taking part. And you meet a lot of friends that you have a craic with. You maybe never see them for months. What we're looking for with a... These are fell foxhounds, and what we're looking for - good deep chest, which is the engine, basically, and just a nice confirmation, an athletic-looking animal that can cover the ground like a racehorse. The Ullswater Foxhounds were originally started in 1873 and have been here ever since. It's a part of natural life, country life, these shows. It isn't just about what people think - we follow trails now, so we're all trying to do everything 100% legal in order to get people out on the fells to see the hounds, and just think it's a marvellous sight. And as you can see, we've got the most wonderful scenery around us, that you couldn't wish to live or work in a more beautiful place in the country. Well, Cumbrian dialect originated from the Vikings. The Vikings came over, they went over to the Isle of Man, they went over to Ireland, they looked at Scotland, but a lot of them settled in Cumbria. It was kind of a mixture between the Anglo Saxon language and a lot of Viking words came into it. A few years ago, if you went to a village school, you would hear kids talking in dialect. Other words, such as, a gate is a yat. Er, to bake something is to byak, or a cake is a cyak. A ladder's a stee. We don't say water, we say watter, Ulls-watter. We talk about Ulls-watter. Years ago, a paper never went out of the valley, never mind out of the county. As you probably know, a lot of young people nowadays they don't even converse by tongue. They converse with their thumbs, with their own language. So we don't want to see the Cumbrian dialect die out, but another dialect might take over in its place, but it is getting more and more difficult to get people to join in the society, because a lot of people don't understand it. # Whilst the gimmers bleat and bay # And the lambkins skip and play # Tarry woo, and Tarry woo # Tarry woo is ill to spin # Card it well, oh, card it well # Card it well e're ye begin. # Our hobby, our passion together was hill walking. And then when my spine decided that it wasn't going to hold me up any more, erm... ..I honestly thought I'd never reach another summit, I thought that that was it. It was down... down there in the car park in my wheelchair, watching other people don their hiking boots and throwing on their rucksacks and setting off for a day in the hills. I mean, when we, er... When we come out on any kind of adventure that brings us out into the fells, our first port of call is an Ordnance Survey map - we look for bridleways. And the vehicle that we use is a class 3 mobility vehicle, er... and so it's allowed to go where any boot goes. But everything's based on safety. That's why we always have Jonathan with us. And, you know, it's not about sanitising routes either. If Mother Nature's put those stones there, the stones are there for a reason and I haven't been able to get to the top. We're looking at the technology that's out there now to be able to get people with disabilities out into the fells and into the mountains. I always talk about my wheelchairs as being my shoes. And this here - I've got my four-season boots on today. To be out here in the fells, it's... It's an emotion, it's... You've got the views - that feeling inside that is just... Oh. A word hasn't yet been invented... ..to express how I feel today with all this in front of me. I'm above... I'm above some of the summits. But there isn't a word that just... just goes. Flight attendant Nigel Wharmby - I've been on 100 Squadron now for three years. It's probably my last tour of duty, having been doing this for 40 years. I happen to be operating out of Leeming in North Yorkshire, but I actually live at the base of Helvellyn. I live in the little village of Patterdale. So Helvellyn to me is my local mountain that I'll climb not every weekend of the year - but certainly half the weekends of the year I'll be seen on Striding Edge. We've actually had an aeroplane land on Helvellyn - not in my time, I hasten to add, I'm not that old - but back on 22nd of December 1926, a light aircraft intentionally landed on the summit of Helvellyn, and then, more importantly, managed to get airborne safely again. Fortunately for 100 Squadron, because we fly the Hawk, unlike my previous aeroplane, which was the Harrier, which could vertically take off and land, I'm afraid we won't be landing on Helvellyn any time soon. All of our flights require quite a lot of planning and briefing before we go, so for an hour in the air, I'm probably going to spend an hour and a half, maybe two hours planning, and then another hour briefing. The demands of low-level flying depend very much on the weather on the day. On a day like today, weather is really good, then accurate navigation is a lot easier than in a difficult weather day where there's a lot of low cloud. Obviously, there are set limits in which we're allowed to low fly, and as the weather comes down, the pressure on her to navigate accurately becomes more difficult, particularly when you're in terrain that maybe you're not familiar with or where there are no margins for error - so, for instance, when we're mountain flying or going through the mountains, there aren't many areas in the country where we can actually do that. Obviously there's the Highlands of Scotland, there's the mountains of North Wales and there's obviously Cumbria. For us here at Leeming, Cumbria is literally only ten minutes' flying time away, and so we're going to use that as often as we can when the weather is fit. We set up the times on target, so we try to be over a particular spot on the ground within plus or minus five seconds. And again, depending on the weather, we might have to deviate for weather and get ourselves back on track. What's it like to low fly 450 miles an hour through the Lake District? It's pretty exhilarating, I have to say, and I've been doing this for 40 years. The low-level flying is something that's a very perishable skill. Low flying over level terrain is one skill, but low flying through mountainous terrain, where you're manoeuvring the aircraft at high G around some fairly steep corners is a completely separate skill, and particularly when you're flying in formation. 100 Squadron's role in the Air Force - we're the RAF's aggressor squadron, so we provide operational support to the front line, primarily to our Typhoons and to our F-35 Lightnings, where we act as an adversary aircraft - a highly agile fighter - to conduct their training. The scenery is diverse. It doesn't matter where you go, you've got a different view to have to contend with - the colours, the different seasons, everything is different. I've spent 20 years going around the Lake District just loving every part of it, really. It's really special. Well, of course, once the colours come out, as they're just about to emerge now, I think, and trying to get them down on the painting is the challenge, of course. And sometimes you get it - sometimes you don't, really. I've painted the sky three or four times now cos it keeps getting splattered on by the rain. Actually, it makes some quite interesting patterns. It's a bit difficult to keep having to hold on to your easel to stop it blowing away, but we're OK. We're persevering. We're hardy people here in the north. We do the dawn cruise twice a year. We do one in spring and one in autumn. They asked if I would run a photography cruise and I said, "Yeah, OK, I'll do a photography cruise, but I'll do it at dawn." And I suppose it was for selfish reasons as well because I wanted to be out on the lake at dawn. We're going to circle round and do that again, so if you do want to swap... In a previous life, I was a detective with Cumbria Police for 26 years, police officer for 30. And to de-stress from that, I started doing more walking, fell in love with the scenery all over again. I'd always wanted to take pictures, but I suppose life, kids, and whatever else have got in the way. So I bought a digital camera just to record my walks. Then 2014, three years after I retired, I won the UK Landscape Photographer of the Year, Charlie Waite's competition. I suppose, from thinking, when I retired after 30 years in the police, that, "What am I going to do? My life's over." And all of a sudden, I've had a second life. You're going to lose the focus of what you're shooting at. What I find with photography - I find that photography almost makes you see the countryside again, see it through different eyes. You appreciate the beauty more. And I'm not one of these that goes from honeypot location to honeypot location. I just love the outdoors. It's not about a love of photography, it's about a love of the outdoors and appreciate what we've got and how important it is, what we've got. And it's really... You know, it's about photographing with the heart. If you feel no emotion for your subject, then there's no emotion going to be in the picture. Anybody who views the image isn't going to feel any emotion, erm... So it's really about trying to get people to fall in love. It's not thinking about leading lines. It's not thinking about rule of thirds. It's not thinking about any of these technical compositional aids. It's about seeing something that you love that makes you shout and swear and makes you want to photograph it. Well, I still like to think of the Lake District as home, even though I moved away at the age of 18, having grown up in Kendal. So these trips, when I can manage to get up here are really quite precious. As I say, I grew up in Kendal, went to school there. I think that's probably where I first sort of got the inspiration to get involved in weather. I mean, for one thing, you experience an awful lot of weather in the Lake District! You can't get away from it. But we actually had a weather station at school - I used to do the daily readings there - and from there, that kind of developed the weather interest a little bit more. First job - British Antarctic Survey as a meteorologist - I actually went down and spent two years in Antarctica back in the 1980s, which was an amazing experience, and definitely drew, I think, on my days in the Lake District fells, as well. After that, joined the Met Office as a weather forecaster back in the mid '80s. And, well, that was my career for over 30 years - 20 years of that as a weather presenter on the BBC, doing things like the Countryfile forecast, for example. Which, of course, is of big interest to people getting out and about in the hills, like this. It's a really, really difficult place to predict for. The weather just changes so much. Mountains have a really big effect on the weather. They actually create their own. You often hear people say, um... ..in the mountains, the weather's completely different in one valley to the next. Um... and that's absolutely true. And we can actually see it here today. Er... Helvellyn, covered in cloud. Looking out over there, to the Eden Valley, the sun's actually shining out there. I can see patches of blue sky. You know, mountains are to weather what a boulder is to a river. It blocks the flow. It's forced to go around it. So just like water has to go over, around a boulder, then the weather has to go around these mountains. And that's what makes these sort of landscapes so fascinating. On a day like today, even with all this cloud cover, I'm seeing breaks in the cloud as the wind just becomes that bit more turbulent. We're seeing lovely light effects just drifting across Ullswater there. And I can see shafts of rain as the showers are beginning to come in. It just... It's what makes it just so beautiful, particularly in this soft autumn light. I mean, if you just go a few miles that way to Ambleside, the annual rainfall there is something like 2,000 millimetres of rain - so about two metres of rain a year. But then a few miles out that way, in the Eden Valley, it's well below a metre. So much less than half the amount of rain you get over in Ambleside. And the reason for that is that most of the rain-bearing weather systems that we get in the Lakes come in from the west, from the Atlantic. That rain-bearing cloud comes up against the western side of the fells. The air is forced to rise as it comes up against the mountains. As it rises, it cools, it condenses. That thickens the cloud, if you like, as it's rising up the mountains. And then rain falling from higher clouds actually strips out the moisture of the lower-level clouds as it falls through. And those two things combine - and particularly combine here in the Lake District - to provide some huge rainfalls. So having dropped all that rain over that side, there's not much left then to fall over this side, in the Eden Valley. That's why the Eden Valley sits in what we call a rain-shadow effect. Now, of course, the temperature drops with altitude in the atmosphere. Um... on average, it's something like a three-degree Celsius drop in temperature for every thousand feet that you go up. So, er... what's that in metric? Around about one degree Celsius for every 100 metres of elevation. Actually, we can see that happening today with that flat base of cloud sitting across the fell tops. Um... as you go up through the atmosphere, temperature's dropping, you're getting to the cloud-base level, the temperature has dropped enough so that the moisture that's in the air is condensing into cloud. But that also means, of course, if you set off in the valleys - where, today, the temperature's around about ten degrees - by the time you get to the top of Helvellyn, which is 3,000 feet, you've seen a nine-degree drop in temperature. So it's not that much above freezing by the time you get to the top. Add in the effect of the wind-chill, with this wind today being accelerated over the top of the fells, as well, and you've got such a different environment up there. And that's why it is easy, if you're not prepared, to, er... to get caught out. The conditions are so different on top of the fells compared to the valleys. So I've said a lot about how mountains shape the weather, but, you know, to some extent, the weather has shaped that mountain over there, Helvellyn. The effect of the prevailing winds, the prevailing weather systems, leave us with the shape of the mountain that I can actually see, looking across Ullswater even today. This is Gowbarrow Park, and it is a lovely site that is located on the northern shores of Ullswater, just to the east of the National Trust's Aira Force woodland. It's a fantastic example of one of the Lake District's pasture woodlands, which is one of Britain's priority habitats. This tree is a pollarded wych elm. It is easily the crown jewel of the Lake District. It's so special. It really is an antique that sits in the landscape. But it isn't its antiquity that makes it so special, it's all of the life that this tree supports. In particular, its lichen interest. This here is known as the lungs of the forest, or Lobaria pulmonaria. And it is a species that you find on very, very old trees in old woods, and is characteristic of clean air. This species is one that we have an international responsibility for, which means that the UK has over 10% of the global population of this species in these woods. And over the years, we have seen significant declines of this species across the Lake District due to pollution, such as that coming from cars, from agriculture and from industry. Now, lichens inhabit every type of environment - you can see them from the lakeshores to the tops of the mountains - and they add so much colour and texture and biological integrity to the world around us. I feel hugely concerned in terms of the increased number of visitor pressures within the Lake District. These habitats are so incredibly sensitive to environmental pollution. However, these habitats, and the species within them, are there for people to see and for people to enjoy. So I'm such an advocate for people visiting these environments, but it all just needs to be done so incredibly sensitively. This species here is known as the sunburst lichen, or Xanthoria parietina. And when you start to see this one creeping into the environment, you start thinking what's going on in terms of its quality. Because this species here is very tolerant of nitrogen pollution. And you also tend to find it in massive abundance along trees that border the roads. From the life that grows on these trees to the trees that are situated in the landscape, all of these elements of the natural world have a really important story to tell. But, unfortunately, most people don't even know about their existence. And how are they meant to care and want to protect something if they don't even know that it exists? Well, we're in a tenancy here with the National Trust, and, er... obviously, this is a park that they're wanting to supposedly re-germinate into, you know, a bit more, you know, a little bit more woodland. And cattle seem to keep the grass down, you know, better than sheep, really. You know, put traditional breeds on, which we have, which is a Blue-Grey cow, so... And then the Charolais calf. I've just fetched a little bit of supplementary feed for the cows. You know, it's just getting that time of year now where there's not a lot in the grass, so a little bit of feed there gets them content and keeps them going. So it's just a nice morning to come and check on the... on the cattle. So, yeah, that's what, er... we're doing this morning. And then we're going to obviously go and put a wall up while we're here! Where we're at today is an old deer park. Back in the 1600s, originally grazed by deer. Up until the latter 100 years, it's been grazed by the more domestic farm animals - sheep and cows. Important sites like this, Glenamara Park, is full of veteran trees. We've removed the sheep, working with our tenant, to try and get some more regeneration. And it's farming and conservation working in harmony. I'd say the National Trust is very important to maintain the landscape, the cultural landscape. The National Trust has 90 farms in the Lakes. Not every day is like today. We do get a lot of wind and rain, which makes the job harder. Being out, you know, all day putting walls up, fencing. It does get a bit monotonous at times, but it's days like this make up for it. And, er... being outside in the countryside, it's... It's great. # A distant glow, a timeless flow # Of secret whispers and evermore # A sight to breathe if you believe # Through all his wonders there's time to live # An open meadow, a distant glow # It is your calling before the show # It stands alone there # Observing life # Tall as his shadow # Warm as his light # The mountain sings His voice is bright # A perfect sunrise to end the night # A perfect day to find our way # Towards the mountain # Where I shall stay # The top is nearly beyond this stone # I'll soon be standing yet not alone # I'll stand with him now We'll watch the sky # We'll watch the birds as they fly by # Up high... # These fells are so special, they simply take your breath away. And they give unconditionally to us all. This is a working landscape, full of traditions and old ways. And if we don't keep them, we lose everything that Lakeland is - a place where we work with nature and not against her. This is a place of land and lives interwoven. Its future is, quite simply, in our hands.
