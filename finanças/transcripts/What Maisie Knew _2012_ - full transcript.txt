You want to sleep with Mommy tonight? Mm-hm. In my bed? Mm-hm. You promise not to kick me? I promise. Yeah, okay. Shall I sing to you? Yeah. Yeah? Mm-hm. What song? One of your songs. Oh, well, sugar, those aren't really meant to put people to sleep. What did you sing me when I was little? Um, like, you know, Rock-a-bye Baby. That's for babies. So? "When the wind blows The cradle will rock" "When the bough breaks The cradle will fall" "Down will come baby Cradle and all" Are you sleepy? A little. Why don't you just close your eyes and try, okay? Okay. Okay. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. I'll help you fall asleep. "Rock-a-bye baby" "On the tree top" "When the wind blows" "The cradle will rock" "When the bough breaks" "The cradle will fall" "And down Will come baby" "Cradle and all" Pizza man. Hi. Hi. Can you sign this, please? Sure. Wait for me. Pizza man's here. You haven't had a creative thought in your life. What have you done in the last five years? How jealous you are. I'm jealous? There's your tip. Thanks. You're welcome. Goodnight. I've-I've done my mid-life crisis. You should get on with yours. What? Don't talk to me that way. You want to play Tic-tac-toe? Sure. Why don't we eat outside? Okay? Walk a way like you always do. Hey, can I have some pizza? Sure. Mm-hm. Mm. Nice. Tic-tac-toe. Look, I won. Come on, Maisie, you didn't let me play. Look at me. You're cheating. Maisie, do you ever wonder what Margo thinks of us behind that hauntingly calm exterior. Okay. Enjoy- Do you want to be"Xes"or"Os"? Um, I want to be"Os". The ants go marching one by one. Hurrah, hurrah. The ants go marching one by one. The little one stops to suck his thumb. You're a liar and a thief. This is a colossal waste of time. Fine, go. Hey. Hi. Susanna. Is that Daddy? Shh, go back to sleep. Open the door. Open the damn door. Damn. Stop making that fucking noise. They hate me in this building. Oh, there you are. At last. Open the door. Susanna. Go away. Open the door. No. Open the fucking door. Not this time. I told you it would happen if you left. What? Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious. It's my apartment. Open the goddamn door. No. You're a fucking headcase. Fuck you! Now, remember your soil should be damp, not soaked. You father's here. Maybe your dog died. I don't have a dog. You're never going to lose money on art unless you overpay. This is a good price. I need to know if you want the paintings, I need to know ASAP. Let me just get rid of this call. One second. Here is this month's schedule. We would prefer if you'd wait the few extra minutes until the end of the school day so that we don't have to interrupt class. Okay. Okay, I'll make sure that absolutely doesn't happen again. Listen, why don't you and me go and get ourselves a nice double espresso? With Mommy? No, no, just you and me this time. Eh? Fun, huh? Hey, so they're exemplary pieces- Are you kidding me? What were you going to do? Take her to Argentina? I'll call you back. People, just do I need to get some help? No. This is not a game, Beale. Come on, baby. Daddy's not going to pick you up anymore. I'm just going to pick you up, okay? Are you okay? It's okay. I'm only her father. Wow, Pooh, you have your own TV? Yeah, we can watch it later. Hey, cool. A little monkey. What a lovely room. Thanks. Need anything before I go? No, I'm all set, thanks. Bye. Zoey, I want you to listen to Maisie's mother, otherwise I'm going to come back and there's not going to be a sleepover, all right? Okay. Look. Okay, on the crown. Icing. Icing really hot. You got it? You got the icing? Candy. Oh, candy. Woo! Look at that slide. Slow move. Now put the... fourth one on me. Oops, sorry. Look. It's red, white, and green. Wow. Let's go back inside. Hey, listen to this. You guys hear that? I really love how he weighs back on the beat. Yeah, just want to get down. That's you. Yeah, yeah, it's good. Yeah. I'm going to find a whiskey. "Hook and line I still blow away" "With your Hook and line I still blow away" "With your Hook and line I still blow away" "With your Hook and line I still blow away" Zoey. Don't cry, Zoey. Oh. This is the heart line. And you're going to meet a very interesting man. Extraordinary. Oh, hey. You're back. Hon, you're supposed to be in bed. Zoey's crying. Oh. I'm really sorry. Hey, at this age- Yeah, you know, at this age they don't- Um, all right. Thanks for coming. Goodnight. Go. Bye, Zoey. Bye. Bye, Zoey. Go back to bed, baby,okay? So much for them testifying for me. Fuck it. The mom's a total Nazi anyway. Okay, Maisie, come on, which one? That one. You dressed yet? We don't have time for that. We're late. Here. Put these on. Okay. You can definitely mention the time he threw you. He did? Oh, my God, yeah. He threw you across the room onto the couch yelling in your face. Jesus. Don't you remember? It was like your most earth-shattering moment. Maisie? Do you and your mom sing together sometimes? Sometimes. Is it fun? I hope you get what a farce this is. It's ridiculous. We're not even married. And listen, you know, whatever he says- be sure to factor in thirty years of substance abuse. Do you want the chicken? Uh-huh. Okay. Might be a little bit spicy. How does that happen? Here you go. Hello? If you think it's all right. Your dad's coming up. Hey. Oh, my sixth favorite girl. Who's your other girls? Oh, I can't tell you about those. Why not? It's a secret. Do you want some Mandarin chicken? Mm, that sounds good. Hi. I think she's coming back soon. I know. I'm going to grab a few things and then we'll, uh, we'll keep this our little secret. Don't want to get Margo decapitated, no? Uh-uh. Okay. Okay, I got to dash. But don't worry. I'm fixing things, okay? And, uh, thank you. You're one in a million. Hey. Okay, thanks. You're a prince. That's Byron downstairs. She's on her way up. Hey, up, up, up. Come on. The doors don't open until ten after eight. I've got to be at court in 15 minutes. All right, I guess she can come in. Thanks. Love you. My mum says you're supposed to come with me. To your house? No, we're going to walk you home. Bye. Bye. Hi, Maisie. Hi, Byron. You're not capable of taking care of a child. You know better. No, I know you. Really? Yes, yes. I know you. Susanna, you don't know anyone except yourself. You breathe pain wherever you go. Shut up, shut up. That's why the judge and the expert, they saw that. They saw you. No. Then why are they not giving you sole custody? Because you got a female judge, that's why. If that's what you want to tell yourself, then fine. Don't take her, man. I'm not taking her. Don't take her. I'm not taking her. They gave her to me. Hey. Hey, baby. Just the person we want to see. Honey, why don't you get some clothes and things and stuff to take with us? Just do it. It's okay. It's okay. She doesn't need you telling her what I say is okay, asshole! Temper, temper. There you go. I'm right behind you. Hi, Maisie. Hi. Can I take your bag? You want to see your room? So, what do you think? You know, you have Margo to thank for... most of the stuff. Why don't I let you two catch up on the world events? So, you surprised to see me? It's kind of funny, huh? Hello. Hello. How much? That's academic. Look, no one in America has heard of him. I don't know why but- Fine, okay, let's see. Okay, bye. You can write in straight lines. You got it. I may need to take off to Italy in the next few weeks. Oh. So, you think you could, uh, keep an eye on Maisie? Okay, sure. Go on, start again. You know you're only supposed to do the first letter, right? Your passport is in order, right? Mine? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Good. Yeah. Because this work should only take a few days. I thought after that maybe we could go on a little cruise in the Aeolian Islands, you know, say something like that. Yeah. I've never been to Italy. Oh. Or on a boat. Right, great. Well, then, that's good. We'll do that. We're going on a boat? When? Well, don't start packing just yet, okay? It's all depending. What's all this? I got a flower delivery for Maisie Beale. Maisie? Oh. That's just- This is totally inappropriate. Get them back to the delivery guy. The guy already left. Okay, I'll take it. Ten minutes and then homework, okay? Okay. Sweetie? What are these? I don't know. But, I mean, did you put them in there? Maisie? Mommy sent them. Oh. Well, we should put them in some water. Can't I just keep them in the closet? Why? 'Cause daddy threw them out. Oh. He's allergic. Really? I'll tell you what. Why don't we press a few, and then you can keep them forever? That'll be our little secret, okay? Okay. Why don't you pick some of your favorites? Okay. I like this one. This one. Okay, here's our book. And this one. When we go back to Mommy's, can we bring Starbrite's corral? Um, sweetie, I'm not going with you. Oh. I'll be here when you get back. Okay- So, where do we put the flowers? In the middle? You put them in this side. Gently. You now, your daddy's sad when you're not here, right? So, um. It's nice for him to have someone around to... cheer him up. And do the shopping and everything, too. So, since we like each other, we thought that maybe I could do that. How does that sound? Good. Let's do another. Okay. I think the roses would be too big. Yeah. That one's nice. Try that one. Oh, my baby, I missed you so much. I missed you, too. Look. Jesus. Jesus, how did that happen? I touched my arm on the stove And I got burned and I cried. I bet you did. I bet that hurt. How did it happen? Did daddy let you cook by yourself or something? Oh, god. Okay. The court says that I'm not supposed to say anything, But I would be, like, totally negligent if I didn't tell you That you really have to watch yourself When you're alone with daddy, okay? Margo was there. Margo? You mean, You mean our Margo? Margo who was at our house? That Margo? You have a nice room at daddy's? Uh-Huh, I have a canopy bed. Oh, that's nice. Does Margo have a nice room? It's tiny, and when you look out the window, there's a wall. Ooh, daddy must not like her very much if he gives her a room like that. He likes her. Yeah? Does he- Does he give her a kiss? Anything like that? Show her how much he likes her? I don't know. No? No, huh? Yes, yes, I'm sure. She just told me. Hang on a second. Hey, baby, go play in your room for a little bit. I'm going to finish this phone call, okay? No, he's got her living with him. What do you think I want? I want you to take that asshole back to court And get me sole custody. Maisie? Careful, Maisie. Why would you be afraid of her? I mean, fine, maybe she looks a little funny, But that's, like, really narrow minded. I don't want you to grow up to be one of those people 'Cause it's just not cool. And you know what? She's the kind of nanny you're supposed to have. I mean, she's not some tramp with a daddy fixation. She smells funny. She does not smell funny. That's the way a nanny is supposed to smell. Come on. Okay, let's go. Come on, Maisie, let's go. Get your stuff, sweetie. Hey, turn around. You're going to see him soon enough. I will? You're going to be a flower girl. I am? Yeah, there's nothing he won't do. Here comes the fucking bride. The collar is sticking up a little bit there. Yeah, good. Mrs. Beale, this is Principal Fairchild- Tettenbaum. This is my third message. I would appreciate a call back. Thank you. Maisie, are you sure your mother knows she's supposed to pick you up? I don't know. All right. I'll figure something out. Oh, Mais. I thought that Maisie's mother was supposed to be doing pick up today. She is. If my husband hadn't checked his messages at the airport, we'd be on a plane. I'm supposed to be on my honeymoon. Hey, excuse me. Is this, uh- Susanna Nun. She sent me to get her daughter. Who are you? Uh, I'm her, uh, sort of like Maisie's stepfather. You're what? Yeah, I'm married to Susanna. Hey. How-how are you, Maisie? I'm Lincoln. Do you remember me? We met before a few weeks ago. Remember that? This is- We don't just release children to anyone walking into the office. Um, no, of course, no. So, I've got Maisie, and I don't know what to do, so can you please call me back? I can't get hold of him. Would you want to call Susanna? Just if you want to make sure I'm not some random- I'm not going to call Susanna. Why don't you call her? Yeah. Yeah, sure. I can call. Hey, it's me. Yeah,no, it's good. I'm outside the school here with Maisie, and Margo is here. I understand. Yeah, well, she doesn't really know who I am. Yeah, all right. Just one second. Uh, it's Susanna. Hello? Yes. I heard you. Okay, so I'll just take Maisie- He-hello? Susanna? Hello? Okay. Uh, I guess that's done. Yeah, I guess. I've got to go. You need a cab? Yeah. I'll get you one. Hey, taxi. Hi. Okay, Maisie, I'll see you in ten days. I don't want you to go. It'll be okay, okay? I promise. I have to go. I don't want to go with him. Oh, Maisie. I really, really love you. Okay? Okay. See you in ten days, okay? Bye, sweetie. Have a nice honeymoon. Bye, Maisie. Please say bye. JFK, please. Yeah, we should probably wait. She's lost it. No, we need some more. Oh, I'll be back. Baby just came home. I have to kiss you. Mommy? Yeah? Did you really get married? Uh-huh. But I still love you the best. And I'm still your mommy, right? And, you know, he's just-he's just like a friend. You don't have to call him Daddy or anything. Just like-just like you don't call Margo mommy, right? You can just call him Lincoln. Did you have a flower girl? Oh, you know what? If we did, it would've been you. But we kept it really low key, and, um, it was just like with a Justice of the Peace kind of thing. We didn't even have a cake. No cake? No cake. Sad but true. Here, want to see something? You want to see what he gave me? Look at this. Look at that. It's tiny. It is tiny, isn't it? Tiny, tiny, little one. Hey. Hey. Sorry. It's okay. Come on in. I- I got to go to work actually. Okay. It was nice seeing you again, Maisie. Say goodbye to Lincoln. Bye. Bye. How tall he is. He's so tall. Doe she always work at night? Yeah. He's pretty much just a bartender, but you know, whatever. It's good, so when I'm working, he can watch you. It's going to be good. Can I tell you a secret? I married him for you. I married him for you. "Sleep tight On the night train" "No pain" "I don't remember" "Oh a couple Of years" "Did some Good for you" "No your eyes" Hey, it's too thin. I want to do a couple more, and then I want to hear it doubled, okay? You go it. What are you making? Is it a palace? It's a castle. Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. It's beautiful. You're really good. I don't know how to make one of those... bridges. Like a drawbridge? Well, just, um, if you make the doorway here and then like the bridge going down and then some chains. That's it. With a moat. I can't do it. You do it. But it's your drawing. Really? Okay. Maybe you can draw some animals in the moat, some dangerous animals so people can't swim across. Crocodiles and some polar bears and stuff that will eat you. Okay. I haven't used a crayon in a really, really long time. When I was a kid, I read this story about a family, and their car broke down in the desert. And do-do you know how they survived? How? They ate crayons and paste. Ew. It sounded pretty good to me. I used to sneak paste to eat when I was a kid. You did? "I don't remember" "Ooh a couple" The stuff we had was really good. Delicious. You should try it. No. No? Hey. You want to come in the booth with me while I sing? Okay. Come on. Hey. You didn't say goodbye. Yes, I did. No, you didn't. I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you so much. Okay. All right. I'll see you in ten days, okay? Bye, baby. You cannot tell him, so that you really can't show him. Excuse me. Excuse me. Who's that? Hey. What are you still doing here? Um, ok- Le-let's go. Let's go and check. No, no, he didn't forget. He knows it's his pick up day. Honeymoon my ass. He's messing with me. Look, it's a violation of the court order, and he agreed to those dates before he left. You got to be kidding me. Great, okay. So, he says it's a violation of the court order for them to not let us pick her up. But if they don't pick her up, it's not a violation, okay? He knows it's his pick up day. Maybe- What, what, what? We could go back to the court again. No, no. I'm not subjecting myself to that bullshit. Where are my cigarettes? Jesus. A witch hunt, that's what it is. Hey, are you hungry? Do you get to make all the food for everyone? Uh, no. I'm just-I'm just a bartender. Do you get lots of money? Well, I get tips. But not lots of money. I wouldn't say that, no. Do you think it's important to make lots of money? Uh-huh. How come? So you can be rich. Oh, of course, so you can be rich. What if you like doing something where you don't make lots of money? Like what? Like being a teacher. Or maybe you want to be a nurse. Or a fireman. Or a bartender. Yeah, or a bartender. For now. Here we go. Bon appetit. I- I thought you said you liked eggs. I don't want to ruin it. Okay, see you later. You're supposed to walk me in. Are you sure we don't say bye here? Really? Okay. Maisie has something she'd like to share with the class. This is my new stepfather. Hi. My father married my nanny, so court made my mommy get married, too. Tyler. I've two stepfathers. But one is almost dead. "And most castles had 50 rooms and were in England. "If someone hurt your animal or tried to be rich, "they would be killed and put in jail. "A lot of people in jail hurt their-selves "so that they could go to the hospital and have food. "They ate stale bread, and then gave the bread to the homeless. The end. Life in a Castle by Maisie Elizabeth Beale." Wow. That's amazing. What am I, invisible? You know, you don't get a bonus for making her fall in love with you. Hey, baby, why don't you go to your room for a little while so Lincoln and I can talk, okay? Dude, how am I supposed to go away on to work and leave her with you when you're full of shit? What are you talking about? And when did this tour come? You deliberately undermine me. Why does everything have to be such a nightmare? You know, I've turned into this like petty- I don't recognize myself anymore. You know, baby, all I wanted was for him to make things easier for us. Your story is very cool. Thank you. Hey. What are you thinking about? Nothing. No? You want to come to work with me tomorrow? Maybe you could help me pick out my costumes for the tour. Would you like that? Your dad's an asshole. He really is. First he disappears, and then he shows up out of nowhere. I don't know how to deal with this. I really don't. Baby, I got to lie down. Lincoln, Beale's downstairs. Hey. Come here. Whoa. You missed me? Uh-huh. Yeah, we were wondering when we were going to see you again. You're the husband? Yeah. It's-it's the new husband. My name is Lincoln. It's Beale. Pleased to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'd give you a couple of pointers but I doubt that the, uh, Jacoby and tragedy that was our relationship would apply to the farce that you two guys are playing out. Okay. Okay. Anyway, good luck. Yeah. Bye, Maisie. Whoa. Bye. Thank you. Tall and young. Ha. It's funny. He's so not her type. Hilarious. How's your mom? Fine. Happy? Uh-huh. A word that sounds like owl? Tyler. Clown. Clown. Excellent. Victor. Town. Town. Maisie. Sound. Sound. Good. Which is your favorite? I like the blue one. It's getting late, Mais. We should go. Are we still going on a boat with Daddy? What boat, sweetie? In Italy, like he said. Um, I don't know. Maybe. Are you and Daddy still married? Of course. It's not like pretend? No. Why would you ask that? I don't know. Oh, Mais. Come on, Beale, you didn't even tell us you were leaving. First, we were going to be coming with you, and then it was only going to be for a few days. When are you coming back? What do you mean you don't know? Hold on. What are you doing up? Does your throat still hurt? It's not time for your medicine, yet. I'm talking to your father in London. Can I talk to him? Here's Maisie. Daddy? I don't feel good. No. I miss you, too. It's me. I don't know. I told you. They were supposed to pick her up three days ago. It would just be nice to know when anything is going to happen about anything. Okay- No. I should just go. Right. Bye. I'll be right back. You're three days late. It's 10:00 at night, and she's not well. It's okay. We'll take a taxi. It's not okay. She's got a temperature of 101. It's- Hey. Oh. You're not feeling well, are you? I have the bug. Oh, the bug. That sounds bad. Why didn't you come? I'm sorry. There was this whole mix up and- Well, kind like three mix ups actually. I have to take my medicine in an hour. Okay. Okay. So, what do you want me to do? Susanna is going to kill me. Come back in a day or two. A day or- I can't come back tonight without her. Susanna is going on tour this weekend. Lincoln, she's a child. She's not well. I'll see you in a couple of days. Okay? Get some rest, so you feel better, okay? Goodnight. That one. Good choice. Hey. Mommy. No, we need some of- Baby, let me show you this bus. It's good, huh? You got ice-cream. You got chocolate. You want one of these? Hang on tight. You got it? I got it. Cool. I- I can't talk right now. Good, here we go. Here we go, baby. I can't see anything. One, two, three, cheese. Hey, baby, look, there's Lincoln. Come on, let's go. It sucks that we don't have more time together. But you know I love you more than anything, right? Okay? I do. Okay, go. Watch out. Okay. Okay, bye. ...hotel room. She's in the bathroom for like 15 minutes. I'm watching television... and she comes out of the bathroom buck naked. I'm like, okay, fine... I push her up against the glass- Your order, sir. Do you want to come sit over here instead, by the cherries? It's more fun over there. Is it okay if she sits here? It's fine. Check this out. Hello? Ooh! I can't hear you! It's like you're a monkey. Oh. You got an eye on that? Don't. I that it? Again? Yeah, I'll try. I'll call you back. Hey, Maisie? Come here a minute. They called from-from work, and someone is sick today, so I'm going to have to go in and work probably. I could go with you again. No. No, we- We can't do that. It's not a good idea. Don't bite your nails. You ate glue. Yeah. All right, wise guy, come on, let's go. I'm not a guy. I'm a girl. Yeah, come on, wise girl. What if she's not here? I don't know. Maybe Caroline can come. No, Caroline's got a boyfriend. Come on. Can I go to work with you then? No, you can't. Oh, we'll-we'll figure something out. I know it's late over there, Beale. I've been stuck in this hallway for an hour. Just tell the guy at the door to come up here and let me in. Hi. What are you doing here? Well, I-I know it hasn't been ten days, yet. But I- He has to go to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh, you know, things have been a little rough with her mother gone and-and all. Right. You know, I was just thinking like we're both in- You thought what? That I feel sorry for you? That I've got nothing else to do? That I'm just that sort of person? Well, I'm not, so you deal with it. It's your problem, not mine. I didn't-I didn't say that. I am locked out of my own apartment because my husband didn't bother putting me on the lease. Like I don't exist. I have done everything I was supposed to. He can't use people like this. I- I didn't realize that- I'm really sorry. Just go. Please. Yeah. Come on, Maisie. I'm sorry. You know I didn't mean you, don't you? Thank you. None of this is your fault. I'll see you later, Maisie. It's not Lincoln's fault, either. He's just mixed up, too. You really like him, don't you? I love him. I'm sorry I got mad at him. He must think I'm awful. Mommy gets mad at him all the time. There he is. Hey, Maisie. Hey. Hi. I did the icing but it's from her 'cause she's sorry she got mad at you. Oh. A cake. I told her that you like chocolate. I do like chocolate. Thank you. Thank you both. Uh, you guys hungry? Yeah? I know someone who works here so I might be able to get you a table. You work here. Yeah, I guess you're right. I do work here. Uh, come on. You know what some people eat here? What? Raw hamburger with raw eggs on it. Ew. These are from Lincoln. Would you eat a raw hamburger with a raw egg on it? Never. Would you? Glasgow has got such a vibe and a lot of culture. It's so funny 'cause, like, to me you don't have a very thick Scottish accent when you say Glasgow, Glasgow. That's nice. Yeah, it is, it is. Yeah, I always wonder if I'll be now. Thank you for the cake and tonight. Yeah. Okay. Goodnight. Morning. Morning. How did you sleep? Good. What do you want for breakfast? Mm, I don't know. Pancakes. Okay. Pancakes it is. Lincoln. Sorry I'm late. The wolf is scaring her grandma. Oh, bummer. She's chasing the wolf there. Okay, higher. Higher. Don't get too close. There are so many. This is really cool. I can't believe I haven't been here before. Look, see, there's a baby turtle. Whoa. Look at that guy. He's checking you out. So many of them. This is great. Yeah, I like it here. You know what? What. You could buy turtles in the street. They keep them in buckets, and they're only $1. Really? Wow. I was bitten by a turtle once. Were you really? Yeah, yeah. It even left a scar if you- Big? It could've left a scar. It's that bad. It could've left a scar. Right, yeah. So, is it quite traumatic for you being here with the turtles? This is kind like therapy for me. Oh, it is? Okay. Meeting the beast again. That's the last one until after dinner, okay? Daddy. We'll do this. Daddy! Hey, my favorite girl. Hey, you got heavy. What a surprise. Yeah, I had a change of schedule. I can smell candy. We went to go see a puppet show. Did you now? Red Riding Hood. Oh, that's scary. I was just about to make some dinner. Ah, not for me, thanks. I ate on the plane. Yuck. I got a couple of calls to make, but I'll join you guys later. Come on, Maisie, we should get washed up. Oh, hey, sweetie. Where is Margo? Pff. Maybe she went for a long walk. Let's go get breakfast. I, uh. I don't need to tell you things are a bit of a mess since your mom ran off. She's on a big tour. Not so big from what I hear. But, uh, be that as it may, Um, I may have to go back to England. Um, couple of, you know, business opportunities, and your grandmother is not getting any younger. You... you understand? Can I come? We can-we can get the coins. Coins? What coins? Like your daddy found in the ground when you were little. You remember me telling you that? Maybe we can find some more. Would you like that? Yeah? Just the two of us? You and your old man digging for coins? I could do with a few. Why not? Your mother would have a fit. But I don't think I'd have a problem squaring it with the judge after she ditched with that bartender. Sure I could settle with Margo without any legal nonsense. Why not? Why not? Why not? Will I get back in time? For what? To go to Mommy's. This wouldn't be a day excursion, you know that. This would be like a permanent thing. All the time? All the time. Maybe Mommy would like to live there, too. No, there's no Mommy in England. You can't- There's a whole ocean. It's- You know, England is, um- England is pretty cold, actually. It rains a lot. And, um. And we need to have to rethink, you know. And you're on the fence, I can see that. I think you'd be happier here. All the same. Um, the good news is that when I visit America for work, I can see you, too. Does your nose still make that squeaky noise when you press it? Okay. You would have laughed at that when you were four years old. Don't deny it. Take care, Mr. Beale. Sure. Bye. Okay, bye. Have a safe trip now. Quinn, 8B. Volgo, 11E. Remmy, 9C. Laporte, penthouse. Remmy, 9C. 1A. Laporte, penthouse. I thought your father was a way. Well, he was here when we came from the puppets. Well, I can't really watch you now. I got to be in Chinatown in half an hour, and I'm sort of late already. Is it still Margo's week? She and daddy had a fight, and this morning she was gone. Gone? Where did she go? I don't know. But Daddy's going to England, and he said that I could go with him and then he said that I couldn't. And then we came in a taxi and he left me here. Well, that's a lot. Okay, I'll- Why don't- I'll call Margo. See if I can find her. It'll be okay. Oh, there she is. Hey. Hey. Thanks. Thanks for coming. Yeah, of course I came. What if they don't have a turtle? I'm sure we'll find one somewhere. Okay, well, actually I have to go this way. But I'll see your turtle when I get home, okay? Thanks for your help. Okay, well, just call me. Mommy! Oh, my God, baby. I'm so happy to see you. We're going to get a turtle. A turtle? A turtle? So, what are you two doing with my daughter? What are you talking about? Looking after her while you're on tour. What are you, like a stalker? What are you going to stiff me next, huh? So, what are you two doing together, huh? What am I doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm back for half a day. Oh, yeah? Cars are coming. Hey, hey, hey! Do you mind? I have a kid here. What the fuck? What are you doing? Really, what are you doing? What are you doing? I'm taking my daughter, that's what. Get out of my face. I'll love to get out of your face. You don't deserve her. I'm done. Let's go get the turtle. Let's go get it. Let's go get the turtle. Do you like it? It's what you wanted, right? Uh-huh. Yeah. What do you want to do? Hungry or anything? You want something to eat? No, thanks. You know, I didn't even know we were stopping in New York. Okay. Okay? Yeah? Okay. This turtle is pretty cool, you know. Want to come to our house? Want to come to our house, turtle? No, I don't-I don't care what you tell him. Just say that I have laryngitis or something or mercury poisoning, all right? Just get me out of it. No, I'm not leaving her. Goddammit, come on. What am I supposed to do? I can't go back on the road right now. I can't. No, I'm not going to. Jesus, what do you expect me to do? Hey, baby. Honey, wake up. Okay, wake up. We got to go. It really sucks but we got to go. Come on. Okay, baby. I am so sorry but I have- I got to go. I just can't miss another show right now because I'll have a massive loss and I just can't handle that right now. Okay? But you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to have you full now for a couple of shows and then we can hang out for a while and then maybe we could sing a duet together. Is that too phony? Okay, uh, you can hang out here with Lincoln until he's finished work and then he's going to take you home, okay? I love you so much. I got to go, baby. Maisie. I'm going to wait till you go inside, okay? It's all right. Hey, hon. Remember me? Where's Lincoln? He's not on tonight. Who are you with? My mom put me here so that I could stay with him. Well, let me talk to your mom. She left. Hi, still serving? Absolutely. Um... stay right here, okay? I'll be right back. Right this way. I'll keep making calls and see if I can find him. Thanks for doing this. No problem. See you tomorrow. What are you doing up? Hey, kid. Where's Margo? I want to go home. Where's Margo? You're going to stay here tonight, remember? It's going to be fine. Let's go back to bed. I want to go home. I want to go home. Come here. Please, I want to go home. It's okay. It's going to be fine. Just a couple of things, okay, sweetie? Okay. What about my turtle? We'll get the turtle. And you know what? What? My cousin told me where the key is. Guess where it is? Where? It's under the mat on the back door. You're going to be okay with your bag? Uh-huh. Oh, God. God, don't do this. There's an upstairs. Yeah, you want to go see? It's cold. Feels good. Look. What if someone buys the house? Where would we go? It doesn't happen that fast. What if we had to go somewhere else? How would people know where we are? We tell them. What if we couldn't find them? We'd find them and we'd tell hem. Anyway, I told them where we were so they wouldn't be worried. Dinner's ready. What do you think this should be? Probably a window. A window? Hey, Maisie. Come on. Okay, let's go to the beach. Can you hear the ocean? Shh. Yes. You can? Wow. Okay. Two pails. Two pails? Let's trade. There you go. Lincoln! Lincoln! Hey. Hey. How are you? Want to see my room? Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to see your room. Of course. Of course. I'd love to see your room. Hey. Hey. I'm sorry. It's not working again. It's not working again. I got it. There's a place in the back where we can get worms. And we can go on the boat next door whenever we want. Oh,wow. Perfect. We can go tomorrow if you want to. Lincoln just got here. How long are you staying? Well, definitely long enough to go on the boat. It's beautiful here. Uh, I brought you something from the city I thought you might like. Wait, I'll show you something. There's a picture that I thought might be interesting. Look at that. Look. You know why? Why? I was thinking we might want this guy. We can put him in our moat. In our moat, that was what I was thinking. Perfect. You guys have a moat? Of course. Okay- What's that? Look at that. Do you want to pick it up? Look at that, Maisie. Gently, gently. It's holding onto the rock. Look, he's moving. He's moving. He's waving at you. You're going to hold my hand? Yeah. Okay. Don't stand on him. Could we go on the boat tomorrow? Why don't you ask the fishermen when they get back? Hold on. Hold on. He said we could go tomorrow! One, two three, four, five, six, seven. I want to buy it. You already have it. I want to buy a hotel. Can I have two? Yeah. Fifty? Are you kidding me? You can't even buy a hostel. You got to do better than that. Give me a little more. Two hotels you got to pay. Give me, uh- Oh, how generous of you. You don't even get a sleeping bag for that. We weren't allowed to play Monopoly when I was a kid. What did you play instead? This Swiss doctor made some games. They're supposed to instill cooperation and pacifism. That's probably why you're losing. Yeah. Ha, ha, ha. In my house, it was every man for himself. Oh, thanks for the warning. What's funny? You are. Yeah, you are. You are so funny. You are so funny. Thank you. Okay. No. Go to jail. Oh, come on. I need some luck now. It's not fair. Surprise. Ah, oh. Oh, my little beach bunny. Hey, guess what? I'm playing Virginia Beach tomorrow night. I found this really nice girl with a dog who can watch you during the show. And then after that we go to North Carolina and Tennessee. Why kind of a dog? I don't know. But, um, it's kind of a long drive, so if you want to say goodbye to these guys, you'd better hurry up. Okay, go ahead. Go on. Or you can just come back to the bus and we can take off and you can open all the presents I got you. You want to do that? I want to meet the dog but maybe the day after. Well, baby, the day after I'm playing Raleigh, so I got to go. Okay, come on. Come on, let's go, babe. Come on, come on. What's up? What's the matter? Come on. We're supposed to go on a boat tomorrow. Baby, we can go on a boat any day, okay? It's not a big deal. We got to go. Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on. Maisie, come on. Don't you want to come? Fine. Why did I fucking bother? God, what is if? You just decided you don't like me anymore? Is that it? What, are you scared of me? Oh, shit. I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. I don't want you to be scared. I'm an idiot, you know. I'm, um- Hey, Maisie, Maisie, baby, you know what? I really love you. I really do. Before you where born, I-I didn't know it was possible to love somebody as much as I love you. You're just like my, my little baby. Can I tell you something? A long time ago I was just like you. I was just like you. You want to go on a boat tomorrow? You want... to stay with them for a while? You know who your mother is, right? You. Let's go open your presents. Come on. All right, you got to tell me how big you want it. That's good. That's good? That's good. Do you know where the filters are? Um, on the table. Look at that little baby pancake. That's tiny. I want a big pancake. Shall we do another one? You ready? I want a big one. You want a big one? This one's very big. Okay, good. Come on, hurry up.
