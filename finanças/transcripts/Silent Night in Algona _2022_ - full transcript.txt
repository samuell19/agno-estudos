(thunder booming) (wind whistling) ("The Star-Spangled Banner") - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States. - [President Roosevelt] This generation has passed through many recent years of deep darkness, watching the spread of the poison of Hitlerism and Fascism in Europe, and the growth of imperialism and militarism in Japan, and the final clash of war all over the world. Then came the dark days of the fall of France, and the ruthless bombing of England, and the desperate battle of the Atlantic, and of Pearl Harbor. - [Reporter] Less than three years before, Hitler had addressed the Reichstag. (Hitler speaking foreign language) (Nazis cheering) - [Reporter] A delirious madness possessed the German nation. - [Reporter] In Rome, his fascist partner had declared: - [Mussolini] Fascist Italy and Nationalist Socialist Germany, ever closely linked, participate from today on the side of heroic Japan against the United States. - [Reporter] A Japanese militarist joins the directive corps. Americans have radios, automobiles, big beef steaks. When a people have those things, they don't want to fight. - [Donny] Listening to war reports? - [Reporter] Americans won't sleep in hammocks or lie in trenches. - Did the radio say the Germans might attack us? - [Reporter] They are like a tiger selling his wool They are sleeping. - Smells really good. - Why don't you go out and fetch some fresh water, hm? Don't forget your coat. - [Donny] Yes, sir. (light music) (light music continues) (light music continues) (plane roaring) (ominous music) (explosions booming) (suspenseful music) (explosions booming) (Rudy clears throat) (gentle music) - How was your morning flight? - Oh yeah, good. Pretty chilly this morning. The crows are starting to pick at the crops. I'm gonna fly like them one day. (gentle music) - Chilly this morning. You enjoy that too. I know we're struggling right now, but it won't last. I promise. - We defying mama's rules by doing this? - No, you are. (Rudy laughing) Let's take these out to the barn. (light music) (engines rumbling) (light music continues) (light music continues) (light music continues) (Eduard's wife speaking foreign language) (light music continues) (light music continues) (brakes squeaking) (Alios speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) - Hello. - Hello. - Welcome to America. - Oh, thank you. - [Soldier] Sit back! - I think Mom's up. - [Rudy] Let's get at it. (light music) - Mom was so mad at you this morning for not wanting to go to church. - [Rudy] None of your concern, Donny. - Do I have to go to church? - What would your mother say? - It's not fair. You never let me- - [Rudy] How was that coffee? Not gonna win 'em all. (light music) (engines rumbling) (light music continues) - The Germans. Were those Germans? - Yes. Let's finish up. (light music continues) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (prisoner speaking foreign language) (hand slapping) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language continues) (suspenseful music) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language continues) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (Jorg chuckles) (dramatic music) (Jorg speaks foreign language) (speaking foreign language continues) (dramatic music continues) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Jorg chuckling) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (soft music) - (exhales) I think these are the last ones. (Rudy groans) (wood cracking) You okay? Your back? - I'll be all right. I'll be all right. Go on and set those down. - You sure? - Yeah, yeah. Let's leave 'em in the truck okay? - Okay. (Rudy sighs) (light music) (Rudy groans) (Rudy panting) (ominous music) Not in my town. (explosions booming) (gunshots banging) (planes roaring) (gunshots banging) Come on. Come on, win it. (ominous music continues) (plane roaring) (gunshots banging) - Did we get them? - No. I think they ruptured my gas tank. - Ah, man. Next time. Come on, let's go get something to eat. - Yes, sir. - [Rudy] Oh. (drums beating) - So my quartermaster looked into the accidental drowning death of Fronz Braun. And he is gonna be given a simple grave marker, two feet high, marble stone, just like any soldier in any American military cemetery. - Sir, I speak for the German men. I must inform you I have applied delegation of Switzerland on this matter. - And if they respond any differently, then we can open this up for discussion again. But until then, this is what I authorize. Dismissed. - Danke schoen for the coffee. - Morning, sir. - Good morning. Have a seat. - Complaining again? - Not any more than normal. Report. - Yeah, sorry sir. The prisoners are in transit back from the cannery. Provost Marshal Klein is overseeing them personally. - Good. - Night shift detachment completed their assignment at the Hormel Cannery. All is present and accounted for. In fact, Hormel donated several cases of product. - Linda? - Yes? Here, sir. - Let us get a thank you note out to the Hormel plant immediately. - Hormel? Yes, sir. Anything else? - [Lodell] That is all. - Hello, Lieutenant Grant. - Ms. Schuler. - [Lodell] That is all, Linda. - Good girl. - How's the wife, Lieutenant? - Good. Good. Very good, sir. - Good, good. So is was that fence repair near tower six coming? - Already done, sir. - And that sewage? - Completed as of yesterday. And all these men, they, they work exceptionally well, I must say. - Maybe the mess hall could use a second coat of paint. - We took care of that about two weeks ago, sir. Do you think it needs another? - Lieutenant, what I need is a new list of duties to keep these men occupied. Honest work, Lieutenant. That's what keeps their minds off troublemaking and escape. Do you know why most of the Civil War soldiers tried to escape? - [Grant] Can't say that I do. - To reunite with their loved ones. So until these men are reunited with their loved ones, it's our job to maintain the peace. - Yes, peace. Sir, speaking about peace, the Red Cross has sent another shipment of goodwill art supplies. - Good. See that they're dispersed accordingly. But give that Eduard fellow first look. Have you seen what he's been working on? - I have. I caught a glimpse of it the other day. Gotta say, it's, it's quite impressive. Beautiful works of art. - Good. Dismissed. (drums beating) (phone ringing) (car engine rumbling) (ominous music) (gunshots banging) - [Donny] Grandma! - [Rudy] Donny! (suspenseful music) - [Checkpoint Soldier] All right, keep it moving. Just follow them. - Sure is a lot of them. (fist knocking) - Hey, good morning, Clara. - [Clara] Carl. - I hope you don't mind me stopping in. - Why don't you come inside? I was just warming some milk. Can I get you anything? - Oh, not for now. Thank you. Where's that little blessing baby Jean at? - Should be up soon. Uh, I wasn't expecting to see you today. - No, I wanted to see you, Clara. You're special to me. We missed you at our gatherings. Again. - Been busy helping Rudy make ends meet. - You know, Clara, I can make things easier for you. That man of yours is broken. A father with a bad back is like a, a singer without a voice. - You should leave. I'll see you at service, I promise. (Carl scoffs) - You know, Clara, you and the boys, you could have it better. - Please go. (door rattling) - Get your man over here and fix this door. (door slamming) (car engine rumbling) (Donny sighs) - You think them Germans are dangerous? - Can't say. - You're right. Can't say, can we? - [Tom] You shouldn't have them Nazi brats around here nohow. - Well, let's not be spouting off with all that hate talk. Now, Tom, them boys over there, they're not any different from our boys. And in the same situation and- - Frank, you've got a grandson fighting in the Navy, right? You're gonna be singing that same tune when a Jap sub sends your grandson to the bottom of the ocean? - Tom Barrett, you're coming darn close to crossing a line with me. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's calm down now. - I fought the Germans in the first war, remember? And I still don't think we need to blame all Germans for the actions of some. - Many folks in our community come from German stock. - That's right. - And good stock it is too. - Well, maybe some of your fine German folk may have treasonous thoughts. Do you ever think about that? - Oh, come on, Tom, you don't- - Not what we're saying is it? - Why don't you go ask some of our Jewish neighbors how they feel about those Nazi death camp reports. - Algona has been called upon. It's our duty as Americans to look over the- - Shut up, Clip. If all you wanna roll over and let these Nazi bastards live here among us, well you watch what happens the first time something happens to our families. (light dramatic music) - Warm-ups? - Oh, definitely. - Yeah, I think that'd be good. - Helen, I'll take one. - Make that two, please. - What do you say, William? - [William] I don't say. - You must have some say on the matter, don't ya? - [William] You don't want to hear what I have to say on such matters. - Well, do you think how these PWs here in town is a good idea? (William sighs) - I enjoy my peace and quiet here in the morning. Time to read my paper, I have my coffee and biscuits, but this morning is turning into quite an awful ruckus. - Yeah, I do apologize for all of that, William. But you, this is your hometown too. You must have some thoughts. - You must know about enslaved people and such, right? - I was born in the north. I'm not an expert on nigger affairs, which disqualifies me from being any sort of expert on Nazi affairs. - But you do have a say, right? (William sighs) - If I give y'all my say, will you leave me alone in peace? I know that fear can create hateful feelings. It's easier to be angry than to own fear. But them boys in that camp, they're just like your sons and your grandsons. They're just doing what they're told. And I'd be willing to wager you that them boys are more afraid of us than we are of them. Now, I sell products at that camp all the time, and I see no reason to hate anybody. This war will be over soon, and them boys are gonna go back home. Home to whatever's left and whoever's left alive. I wouldn't lose no sleep over it. Okay, so why don't you gentlemen go about your business and leave this old negro to his coffee and his newspaper in peace. Hm? (William sighs) - You know where coffee beans come from, little man? - No, where? - Not from Iowa. - I just brewed a fresh pot. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You want anything to eat? - Just the usual please. Hey, I need to go have a word with William. Okay? - Okay. - William, may I speak with you? - Oh, what can I do for you, young Mr. Tietz? - You were saying that you sell goods to the camp? - You heard right. They get most of their goods from corporate accounts, but they do buy some things local. - Well, I might have some surplus that I could sure stand to move. - Well, they buy milk, eggs, pies. Most anything you can get in there. They see it as good relations. - You wouldn't mind if I moved a few items over there would you? - Oh, absolutely I'll do that. And you can go with me on the next trip. I'll make some introductions. - I'd really appreciate that. And I'm more than happy to drive. Hey, Helen. His breakfast is on me. Thank you. - Mr. Tietz. (drums beating) - [Lewis] Hate paperwork. I'm always doing paperwork. Every day I'm doing paperwork. - Ah, Sergeant Lewis. - Hey. - The men who were working lumber further north claims they saw, how you say this? Indians in the forest. - [Lewis] Indian head penny. - They were afraid of getting their hair and the skin removed with a knife. - What, scalped? - Huh? - Indians, nah, not likely. So you found those coins in the back of the truck? - Yes. - Well, hey, lemme trade you up for some, some coupons. Prisoners aren't allowed to have currency. - Ah. - So I'm gonna give you some of these. Thanks. - Ah. I will use it to try this hair piece you speak so highly of. - No, nein, no. Hershey's. - Oh. - It's a chocolate bar. - Ah. - You're gonna love 'em. Little piece of heaven. Hair piece, whole different thing. You don't want that. - I could use a little heaven. Yeah. - Hey, hey. So I heard you krauts was working on some sort of project. - Yeah, we've been working hard on it in our spare time. - Spare time. Hey, this time of year, Christmas, I miss my girl. - Mm. - She's back in Brooklyn. That's New York City. - Hm. - I get real excited about Christmas. She doesn't care that much about it, on account of her being Jewish and all. They don't really believe in that, well the same things that, that all of us... Yeah. Yeah. But I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring that up. - It's okay, I- - I know not all Germans are, you know- - You don't have to explain yourself. - Okay. Okay, yeah. - Yeah. - See you, Eddie. See you. - Bye, Helen. - Take care. - Miss Fitzgerald is real nice, don't you think? - I think we've had enough coffee for the day. (rag rubbing) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (door slamming) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language continues) (Alios speaking foreign language) (prisoners of war chuckling) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Alios speaking foreign language) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Alios speaking foreign language) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Alios speaking foreign language) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Alios speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Alios speaking foreign language) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Alios speaking foreign language) - Hey, hey, fellas. Everything okay? - [Alios] Yes. Everything is fine, thank you. - [Alan] What's going on? (Jorg panting) (Jorg speaking foreign language) - You shall have no Gods before me. (Jorg speaking foreign language) (paper rustling) (Jorg speaking foreign language) - Go with peace, my friend. - I can fix that. My father was a librarian in town. He repaired many books. I helped him when I was a young boy. - I would appreciate that. Thank you. - Yeah. - What set that off? (Eduard sighs) - We all love our country in, in very different ways and it's harder for some to face the facts. - Yeah, I know. I also know that you've been volunteering for night shifts at the Hormel Cannery. - Yeah. I was hoping the extra pay and more time would help me work on the project during the day. - That's actually why I came to speak with you. Might have some good news. Colonel Lodell is thinking about having you and your men go full-time on the project. - Oh. - [Alan] With pay. - With pay? - With a little pay. Possibly as soon as next week. Okay, he's also thinking about assigning you an empty warehouse to use as a studio. - Wunderbar. This would help our time schedule greatly. - Well, it's truly wunderbar what you and your men are doing. - We might be able to finish the new one by Christmas with a little faith. - Amen. - Amen. (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Eduard chuckling) - Hi, Mr. Tietz. Hi, Donny. - Good to see you and your mother getting by with the store. - Hi. - I was thinking about working at the PW camp as a clerk in the canteen. But you know who won't let me go. Yeah, she works there. - Yeah, your mother's just trying to look out for you. That's all. - Mm hm. Well, you have that right. And I'll have to keep looking out for my daughter until she starts making better choices. - Hello, Mrs. Heckler. You look great in your uniform. - Miss. Or, or is, is it? - No, it's okay. You know, since Howard was killed, I'm not really sure what to call myself either. Did you ever get around to trying that ointment for your back spasms? - Oh, no, no. Not yet. How is the second job at the camp? - It, it's okay. Just doing my part to help. - I was just telling Mr. Tietz here about how you won't let me work there. It's not fair. - Fair has nothing to do with it. - Afraid them German soldiers might try and kill us all? (hand tapping) - Oh, no. It isn't the killing I'm worried about with those soldiers. And the danger can be found on both sides of the fence for a girl her age. - Mother, I'm 17. - [Donny] What are you worried about? - Enough, Donny. - [Donny] What? - Hush. - Okay, that's enough. I don't wanna hear another word about it. I need your help with the store. Understood? - Yes. - Good. Okay, I need to get going. Let's catch up soon over coffee. And oh please tell Clara hello for me. - I would like that. And I will. - Anything else? - One chocolate bar, please. - [Sally] Hm, of course. - [Donny] Thank you. - Take care. - Bye. Come back soon. Bye, Donny. - [Donny] Bye. - Hello, Chaplain Fluke. - Eduard. - Hi. - Two pickles please. - Oh, yeah. Thank you. - Three. (Eduard chuckling) Thank you. - We need more supplies. Some of the materials have been weeks incoming. (Eduard speaking foreign language) - There is a war on. Some of the supplies are hard to come by. What do you need? - We need more plaster, fire, paint, it's... - Okay. - Yeah. - I'll, I'll see what I can do. - Yeah, it's, this war has really ruined the spirit of connection between us all. - Yeah. That's why it's good you're doing what you're doing. It brings people together. - Yeah. We need more wisdom in the choosing of our leaders. - Ah, careful. That kind of talk could get you in trouble with some of your own. Assuming you're talking about your leaders. - Oh, ours today, perhaps yours tomorrow. - Hey, if I do get you the supplies. - Hm. - What do you think of this chiseled profile, huh? One of the wise men. - Oh. Ah, perhaps I make an ugly camel after you huh? - Get outta here. I'll see what I can do. (Eduard speaking foreign language) - That's amazing. You're doing so well. Okay, I'm just gonna get in a few here. Oh, ease back. Lower you back. You're doing really great. Oh, very good. Okay, I'm just gonna take off your boots now okay? One moment and I'll help you lean back. Okay, here we go. Ready? (gentle music) (injured soldier speaking foreign language) We're gonna help you. It's okay. (gentle music continues) (crops rustling) (corn husk cracking) (light music) (Rudy groaning) - You okay? Dad? - Pray with me, kid. In our time of need, give us answers and give us strength. (Rudy sighs) (Rudy groans) I'm gonna have to find some help for the harvest. We're late already. (Rudy sighs) This war's left most of the farms short on hands. Those Germans we saw today. - Nazi bastards. - I don't wanna ever hear that kind of talk out of you ever again. - But, Mr. Barrett and even Uncle Sam were saying- - Have you ever talked to any of them? - No sir. - Then don't go making talk based on what others say. Look, in a small town like this, someone's always gonna have an opinion. The best opinions are the ones you make based on your own experiences. - Yes, sir. - I love you, kid. Let's get on back up to the house. Momma's got food fixed. (soft music) (soft music continues) - Welcome, sir. We do not get American soldiers here very often. - Why we allow this rubbish, beyond me. - [Clerk] This is just news. - Well, it looks to me like Nazi propaganda. (cigarette pack tapping) - Do you plan to compensate for those cigarettes, sir? We try to keep very exact books. - I bet you do. Bet you do. (Alfons speaking foreign language) - How's your day been? - Long. Just finally got Gene down for a nap. - Crops need to be harvested and we can't wait much longer. - Yeah. Not sure how we're gonna manage with your back and all. Can't ask my daddy for any more handouts. - I didn't ask for any handouts the first time. - We needed it, Rudy. - I've been thinking about selling some surplus at the prison camp. - Lord knows we could use the money. This house is about ready to fall down around us. Winter will be here soon. And the house does little to keep warmth. - I'll get the house more insulated after we bring in the harvest. Which reminds me, I plan on talking with someone about using them German soldiers as field hands. - What? - Hm? I heard that the Hormel Cannery and certain local companies have used them. "Hard workers," they say, and they actually pay the Germans to work. - Those prisoners here on our farm? - Clara, they send guards. Look, we need help. I need help. The normal hands we hire are off fighting a war. - Do you think that's responsible? - Responsible is paying our bills. Clara. Clara! (silverware clanging) - Are you really thinking about having the Germans here on the farm? - Eat. (Rudy sighs) (paint brush tapping) (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (ominous music continues) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Alios speaking foreign language) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Alios speaking foreign language) (ominous music continues) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (canvas clattering) (Alios speaking foreign language) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language continues) (Alios speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) (foot thudding) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (foot thudding) (Alios coughing) (Alios speaking foreign language) (light dramatic music) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Alios whimpering) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Jorg chuckling) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (ominous music) (dramatic music) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Jorg speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) (Eduard groans) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Alios speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Alios coughing) (saw rustling) (hammer scraping) (nail clinking) - [Rudy] All right, let's move it. - [Donny] This is heavy. Why can't you do it on your own? - Hey, without discipline, we're nothing. All right? - [Donny] Yes, sir. - One, two, three, go. (Rudy groaning) Come on. - [Donny] Mayor Hewitt's here. - All right, kid, finish up. - [Donny] Yes, sir. - Afternoon, Rudy. - Frank. - I got your message. It seemed important. - Well, it is. It is. I've... Well, I've been thinking about the harvest and the shortage of farm hands. - Yeah. - And many of our neighbors have been facing the same issue. - Yeah, I'm aware of the labor shortage. And you with your bad back, I'm sure that doesn't help matters any. - You know that Pioneer and Hormel have been using those Germans. - What are you getting at? - Well, I was thinking maybe them boys would work all right in the fields. - We've been having quite a ruckus just having them in town. Working on a family farm? I don't know about that. - Come on, Frank. What choice do some of us have? Huh? I mean, we're gonna let the crops spoil in the fields because we're too proud to ask for help? - So, you know this idea is gonna create some resistance. - Resistance? You should have heard me drop this idea at the supper table with Clara. (Frank chuckling) Resistance. - I bet. So you think them German boys would behaved themselves? - If it was me cooped up inside that compound, I think I might take to working in the outdoors just fine. - And you'd be willing to go first? - Well, someone has to. - This could blow up in my face if something went wrong, you know? - Or you could be the politician who solved the labor shortage in the area. - Now, I do like the sound of that. I'll tell you what, let me mull this over in my mind a bit and see what we can come up with. All right? - Fair enough. - Hey, Donny. - Hi. - Mind your pop now. - Dad. - Hey, I need you to trust me. Okay? Now, please finish your chores. - Yes, sir. (hay rustling) (Clara sighs) (picture frame clinking) (saw whirring) (hammer pounding) (Alios speaking foreign language) - Welcome, Captain. - Quite the operation you have here. - [Eduard] I, I thank you for the new space. - Well, that was not my doing. So, why, why you building this project again? - I, we just want to bring a touch of joy and the Christmas spirit to everyone. - Right. I read the article in the newsletter, but I wanna know why you're really making it. - I, I, I, I don't understand you, sir. - No, of course you don't. - Very surprised to find you here, Captain. - Oh, sir, I heard so much about this project. I thought I'd take a look for myself. - It's gonna be magnificent. - Yes, sir. Magnificent. - Yeah, Colonel, I want you to meet someone here. Colonel Lodell, this is Eduard Kaib. Eduard's the one responsible for this project. - Oh, it is an honor, sir. I am very thankful for the extra space here and grateful that you're allowing us to do this. - We thought it'd be a very unifying endeavor for everyone. But I didn't mean to interrupt. I have things to attend to. Carry on, men. - [Klein] Hey, sir, if I could just have a moment of your time. - It's looking good, boys. Who wants a candy cane? - Oh yes. - Okay, yeah. Here you go. (thunder booming) (light dramatic music) (light dramatic music continues) (light dramatic music continues) (light dramatic music continues) (Rudy sighing) (lips smacking) (Rudy groaning) (water splashing) (water splashing) (dramatic music) (light eerie music) (Klaus speaking foreign language) (Klaus panting) (Klaus speaking foreign language) (light eerie music continues) (bell clangs) (car engine rumbling) - Good morning, Carol. - Morning, Mr. Tietz. Hello, Donny. - Hello, Ms. Valentine. - Are you gonna hold your father up all day or would you like to come and join the class? - All right, get going. - Thanks for taking me, Dad. - Hey, study hard. - I will. - Rudy, this is Colonel Lodell. - Colonel. - Mr. Tietz. - Rudy is fine. - Rudy, heard a lot about you. - Well, can't believe everything you hear. - Why don't we sit down? - Yeah, please do. - [Waitress] Hi, Rudy. Would you like some coffee? - Black coffee would be great. - [Waitress] How about a danish or roll? - Oh, no thank you. - [Waitress] All right. - Frank here is telling me that you wanna be the first to volunteer our camp labor at your farm. - Yes, I heard that a few companies in the area are using the Germans. - Yeah, but out on the farm with your family. That's a different situation. - I'm aware there's a risk. - These could be Nazis, enemy walking amongst- - A calculated risk. My father used to talk about how the path to success is not a sure one. If I don't get those crops harvested, I'm not gonna make it. (somber music) - Well, I heard you was in here plotting to put them Germans on our farms. We'll just see about that. (Colonel sighs) - I like the way you think, Rudy. We're gonna help you. - Thank you, sir. - No, thank you. (wind rustling) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (prisoners speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (Alios speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language continues) (speaking foreign language continues) (Alios speaking foreign language) (Klaus speaking foreign language) (Altman speaking foreign language) - New York City? (Alios speaking foreign language) (Altman speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (Altman speaking foreign language) You see, those mobsters, with their illegal businesses all over America, are patriotic. (Altman speaking foreign language) - Klaus, (speaking foreign language). (Klaus speaking foreign language) (prisoners chuckling) (Altman speaking foreign language) (light dramatic music) - What's wrong? - We're having the Germans come here, aren't we? - It's nothing for you to worry about. You have homework to do? - A little. - All right. After supper, you get it done. - I will. (light dramatic music) - Are these the last to go? - Yes, sir. - Shackles for him. (Jorg speaking foreign language) (Jorg panting) (Jorg speaking foreign language) - Shut up! - Look, I don't know what the hell you just said, but I do know that cutting trees in the freezing cold will suit you Nazi bastards just fine. (Jorg speaking foreign language) - The tattoo under their arm helps in identification, sir. (Grant speaking foreign language) (Jorg chuckling) Jewish hunter. - [Klein] Move him out. (Jorg speaking foreign language) - Move it! (Jorg speaking foreign language) (thunder booming) - [Clara] Sounds like a bad one's brewing. - It's close. - Maybe we should all go down to the cellar. - I'm going to bed. Tomorrow morning, we have workers coming. - You actually decided on your own? - [Rudy] Clara, please. - To bring the enemy- - Enough! - God forbid something should happen. - Unless God decides to send a group of angels to help by morning, I'm hiring them German boys because we need the help! You know, I'm really trying here. And I'm sorry if you don't agree with me. This is what needs to happen, okay? (thunder booming) - Bring your stuff. Donny, now! (thunder booming) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (Clara sniffling) (wind whistling) (thunder booming) (birds chirping) - Can I stay here today, please? - You need to go get your learning. Giving prisoners corn knives. Seems like a good idea. What? I was joking. - I, uh, I think they're here. - Here we go. (Rudy sighs) (light patriotic music) - [President Roosevelt] But in perhaps every home in the United States, sad and anxious thoughts will be continually with the millions of our loved ones who are suffering hardships and misery, who are risking their very lives to preserve for us and for all mankind the fruits of his teaching and the foundations of civilization itself. (Seip speaking foreign language) (light patriotic music continues) (barn door rattling) (light patriotic music continues) (corn stalks rustling) (birds chirping) (birds cawing) (dramatic music) (Donny screaming) (prisoner speaking foreign language) - Dad! Grandma! Grandma! (suspenseful music) (light dramatic music) Dad! Grandma! (intense dramatic music) (gunshot banging) (birds cawing) - Donny! (corn stalks rustling) Donny! Donny! Donny! Donny! Donny! Donny. (triumphant music) (Rudy sighs) Hi, you're all right. - Hi. I am. - You're all right. It's okay, kid. You all right? Come on, kiddo. Come on. Come on, let's go. (corn stalks rustling) (birds cawing) (soldiers speaking foreign language) - The boy's frightened. - This lad's a marksman. Lined a feather with an M1. - Um, it's a turkey. Good looking bird, though. - You were supposed to be off to school. - I know. - Get going. (Rudy sighs) (hammer tapping) (saw whirring) (sandpaper scraping) (Klaus speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Klaus speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) - Eduard. (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Alios speaking foreign language) (prisoners laughing) (wind whistling) - Well, everything worked out just fine today with those Germans. - You can call them prisoners. Glad the gamble worked out in your favor. You were right, today. (Rudy sighs) There, you happy now? - What'd you learn today in school? - Ms. Valentine taught us about Harriet Quimby. - Who? - The first female to get her pilot's license. - [Rudy] Really? - That's right. How'd you know that? - You don't only get your love of flight from your father. - She was also the first female pilot to fly across the English Channel. - Never heard that. - You know why? Don't tell him, Mama. - I know the answer. - Great, just tell me. - Because the day Harriet Quimby crossed the English Channel was the same day the Titanic sank. - April 15th, 1912. No newspaper stories. It was all about the Titanic. - Oh, the press. (wind whistling) (door thudding) - What's up, doc? (Eduard speaking foreign language) - Bugs Bunny. (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) - Dedrick, (speaking foreign language). (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (both chuckling) - Yeah, that's good. (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) - Oh, good. (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (prisoners laughing) - [Bugs Bunny] Eh, what's up, doc? (prisoners cheering) (light music) - You went too far, Frank. - Don't want to argue with you today, Tom. - That's just too damn bad, Frank. If you're gonna go off and do something stupid like this, you're gonna get a piece of my mind. - [Frank] Tom, please. - These German bastards killed my grandson. Now I know we got some Nazi loving sons of bitches in this town. I know it. But now you're gonna go off and put the families in danger. - Morning, Tom. - Don't you "Morning" me, Sheriff. Did you know about this? - Yeah, Norm and I checked it out and it looks like it might just work out fine. - Might? Sheriff these ain't supper guests. These German bastards are the enemy. - I know you're frustrated and hurting badly, and I'm sorry about your grandson, Tom. - I can see that the law and the politically inept are of no help to me. - Tom! - But don't you worry none, Sheriff. I understand the situation now. Around here we take care of our own! - Oh, Tom sure is mad, isn't he? - Yeah. He was born mad. - He sure did love that grandson of his though. Practically raised him as his own. - I just hope he don't go do something stupid. (wind whistling) - Man, those German boys worked really hard this week. I mean some of the hardest workers I've ever come across. - Yeah, farm work allows these men to spend time in a meaningful way. That's a good situation for us all. - [Rudy] Mm hm. - You know Rudy, you have really done something special here. It takes one man to stand up and have courage and foresight. - Yeah, it was bound to happen. - Oh don't sell yourself short. I mean, it's special. It takes a special man to stand up to be the first. - Talking about being the first Black man in the area? - No. I'm talking about being the first Negro President of these entire United States. Yes, I'm talking about being the first Negro in the area. (Rudy chuckling) - You know, we may just see a Negro president one day. - Not in my lifetime. - [Rudy] Don't sell yourself short. (Rudy laughing) - You got me all right. - [Ruby] Let's get this business- - Let's go young Mr. Tietz. Let's go. (car doors slamming) (soft music) My daddy used to say, that when the sun sets it puts a long day to rest. - Your daddy was right. - Indeed he was. William Hobb, sir. - Aaron Thompson. - Ah, Lodell. Commissioned to the Corps of Engineers with the Army Officer Reserve Corps. Indeed. My boy used to work at the newspaper before he left for training in Alabama. I like to know what goes on in our town. - Hm, where's he stationed now? - We got the Western Union eight months ago. He died in Italy. - You drink? (William chuckling) - If you mean alcohol, I do partake on occasion. - Never been to our club before. (William chuckling) - Your club? Well, I don't believe any Negroes have been in your club unless they were playing music on stage. - Well, Negroes are starting to make their mark in the military, William. I say that we have a toast to your son. - Well, to answer your question, it'd be a pleasurable first to have a drink at your club. - We're doing a lot of firsts around here. All right. - [Waiter] Everything was acceptable, yeah? - Oh, very good. Thank you. - This is, this is classy. - Not bad. - Mm hm. - I think we need a toast to your son's service. - Indeed. (glasses clinking) Yeah. - Ah, that's, that's smooth. - Templeton makes a nice blend. - [William] Hm. - So William, how do you think the town views our camp? (William sighs) - Oh, I think most respect the work you're doing, but others wish you'd never showed. But the merchants in town, oh, they like your business. (William chuckling) - Well, we all probably wish we were at home, that's for sure. - And perhaps one day you will be. But for now, welcome to Algona, Iowa. The corn capital of the world. - That it is. (glasses clinking) You know, at least these German and American boys are not gonna die. And the parents may thank us one day. I just hope our own boys are getting the same kind of treatment. After dinner smoke? - Oh, no, no, no. I, I have to limit my vices. - Oh. (William chuckling) I like the way you limit your vices. - Ah, indeed. On the occasion that I do- - Yeah. Partake in the smoke, I'd rather it not be with those dainty fags. Try one. - Don't mind if I do. - All right. Let's do it. - Nice. - [Waiter] Would you like another? - A couple of beer chasers. - That sounds great. Two pints, please. (William chuckling) - Ah, yes, the A and Eagle have learned to fly. - That they have. (glasses clinking) (Klaus speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Alfons speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Alfons speaking foreign language) - Ah, Thanksgiving. - [Alfons] Yeah. (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Alfons speaking foreign language) - Yeah, (speaking foreign language). (Alfons speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Eduard sighs) (horn honking) (drums beating) (audience cheering) (audience applauding) - Hey, hey, Algona. Happy Thanksgiving. I'm Smooth Dick and these are the Dynamos. Let's get this place going. Let's get in the mood right now. One, two, a one, two, three. (upbeat jazz music) (upbeat jazz music continues) (upbeat jazz music continues) (upbeat jazz music continues) (upbeat jazz music continues) (upbeat jazz music continues) - Those German boys did a fine job. - Don't get him started about how right he was. - Well, everything looks and smells real nice, Clara. - Sure does. Is there anything that hasn't been done that you could use help with? - Um no, I think we're ready to eat. (fist knocking) - I got it. - You expecting anyone else? - Wow, little Donny. - Hello? - Oh, Happy Thanksgiving. - Carl. Why, let Mr. Herman in, Donny. - Didn't mean to disturb you all. Missed you at our gatherings, Clara. You know you promised. - I'm busy. - Too busy for the Lord. - You can leave that Bible outside. - Well, today is a day of glorious thanks. - Would the IOA people agree with you on that point, Carl? How about the Dakota Sioux? - Father. - So how long have you been a sheriff? - I'm, I'm not actually a sheriff. I'm a sheriff's deputy. See, I was one, but- - Oh. - Well, they pulled me outta retirement because the young guys were off fighting. - Okay. - Carl, I'd like you to meet Ms. Valentine. - [Ms. Valentine] Pleasure. - [Carl] Can't say I've seen you at a church Sunday service. - No. - Um and this is- - We've met. - Yes, yes we have. - Yeah, where would that be, Norm? - Well, now Mr. Herman here decided to set up a holy rolling fire and brimstone deal at the courthouse one day and got him a PA system and almost got himself three days in the lockup too, didn't he? - Well, the freedom of speech, deputy. - Yeah, that was disturbing the peace. You took freedom of speech all the way to freedom of screech. And that's a civil infraction in this community. - Well, we don't have a microphone, Carl, but if you'd like to sit and say grace, I guess we can feed you. - I can get you a chair. - No thank you, Donny. Well, if we'd all bow our heads. (Carl clears throat) Dear heavenly Father, thank you for bringing us together today to celebrate this joyous occasion. I pray that you bless the food and the hands that prepared it. And Lord, we ask that you allow us to glorify you in all that we do for this festive night. In the powerful name of Jesus we pray. Amen. (chairs creaking) (Alan speaking foreign language) - I'm gonna speak in English. So most all of you know me. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you and hearing about your families. It's funny that we are all here together at this place in time. The war aside for a moment, we should be grateful. We all know fellow men, soldiers, friends, brothers, sons who have died in this conflict. So I would like to take a moment of silence and recognize our fallen comrades. A moment of silence, please. (drums beating) (soft music) Thank you. Thank you. You know, I don't know how the lines on a map will be drawn in the future, but I do know, I pray that one day soon you will sit across from a loved one at a table and share a meal. Here in the United States, we call this day Thanksgiving. And I'm truly thankful to be here with all of you. And I hope that you can remember your days as, as guests here in Algona. (prisoners laughing) With a few smiles. And with that, I pray for peace. Please. - Yeah, surely. I would like to respond to our gracious hosts. Thank you Chaplain Alan for those kind and true words. I've met the good people of Algona, and I salute all the Americans who performs their duties with honor and kindness. The hearts are grateful and thankful. I too see the future day when we all, all of us will sit a table and share the banquet by choice, and not confinement. Danke schoen. - Happy Thanksgiving. (Seip speaking foreign language) (prisoners speaking foreign language) (Tom belching)| (dog barking) - [Rudy] You okay, Tom? - I was a friend of your father, Rudy Tietz. Traitor! - Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, Tom! All right, I got no fight with you. (Tom groaning) Tom. - This whole town has lost its way, you know? And I tried, I tried to warn you, but nobody's gonna listen to me. - [Rudy] Just tell me what? - Luke Luginsland, I told you. - Told me what? What, what did Luke do? - Oh, you can't understand. I don't know how a whole town could be so blind. - I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about. Okay? What about Luke Luginsland? - Anyway, don't you worry about it now. (Tom chuckling) You know, I used to come here and I talked to your father. Now he was a man. - Tom. - [Tom] He was a good man. He was a man that would understand. - You shouldn't be driving. Hey. (car engine rumbling) It's Thanksgiving, Tom. (dog barking) (somber music) Luke Luginsland. - Missed a good speech earlier. They're good men. - Yes, they are. - Oh, you don't like turkey? No sauerkraut or schnitzel. - It's, it's fine. - You're too noble, my friend. Can I tell you a story? - Please spare me the thankful stories of the Indians and, and turkey, and, and how do you call them? The men with the boats and the hats. - Pilgrims. Yeah, no, no. You'll like this story better, especially the ending. When Mary and Joseph arrived in Bethlehem, Mary was in labor. She was about to give birth. Joseph, he, he knew that something amazing was about to happen, but he had nothing. So, with hope and humbleness in his heart, he went door to door asking for help; for a place to stay, a manger. You have to ask for help, Eduard. - What are you talking about? - The project. Your project. - What about it? - No matter how many night shifts you pick up. (Eduard crying) - I cannot. I'm tired and this is so hard. And I cannot finish by Christmas. - Hey, not alone you can't. You have to ask for help. Your men, they respect you too much to offend you by acting without your permission. Do you need help, Eduard? (gentle music) (Eduard crying) - Yes, yes. (gentle music continues) (prisoners whistling) Klaus, Klaus. (prisoners humming) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (prisoners humming continues) (Eduard speaking foreign language) Okay. (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Alfons speaking foreign language) (prisoners singing in foreign language) (Chaplain Fluke chuckling) (prisoners singing in foreign language) (prisoners singing in foreign language) (Rudy groans) - How is everything today? - Good. - [Helen] No school? - We go back tomorrow. - It's slow in here today. - Yeah, only the two of you. Well, and that smooth talking preacher earlier. Did he come by your place? - What? Carl Herman? - Yeah. He said he was going out to meet with you all. - Donny, let's go. (coins rattling) (children giggling) (Klaus speaking foreign language) (Klaus softly panting) (Klaus speaking foreign language) (somber music) (Klaus speaking foreign language) (Klaus whimpering) (Klaus crying) (Klaus speaking foreign language) (somber music continues) (Klaus crying) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (somber music continues) (Klaus crying) (car engine rumbling) - Are we meeting with Carl Herman? - So I'm told. - [Donny] He's here kind of early. - He shouldn't be here at all! (car doors slamming) (Clara giggling) - Good morning, Rudy. (Rudy sighs) - I, I thought you were out running errands all day. - Oh yeah, I guess I forgot we had a meeting. - A meeting? - Yeah. Didn't you tell Helen at the diner you were coming out here to meet with us? - Well, Rudy, what I meant was- - Carl was just dropping off some literature. Donny. You smell like coffee. You've been drinking coffee? - Yes, mama. (hand slapping) - Donny, outside. - But- - I said go outside now! - You undermine my every word and action. - It's coffee, Clara! - I think maybe I should just go. - Don't you move! I'll get to you in a moment. - Maybe if we had a little more godliness in this house, we wouldn't have such disobedience. - Oh yeah, I think we've had enough godliness visiting this household. - Rudy, what I believe that Donny needs- - Don't you ever tell me what Donny needs. You understand? (baby crying) You may have my wife's attention, but you'll never have my son's. - What, what are you talking about? - You and Gene can leave with the preacher here if that's what you truly want. But Donny stays with me. - Now, Rudy, I believe we're having a bit of a misunderstanding here. Can you let go? - Are you going, Clara? (baby crying) (light dramatic music) - No. (somber music) (baby crying) (Rudy panting) - When I come back, you better be gone for good. (Carl sighs) (wind rustling) Donny! Hey, Donny! Donny! (wind rustling) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Klaus speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language continues) (speaking foreign language continues) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Klaus speaking foreign language) - Yeah. (Alios speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Altman speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Altman speaking foreign language) (Eduard speaking foreign language) (Altman speaking foreign language) (Dedrick speaking foreign language) - Hey, Klaus, (speaking foreign language). Come on, let's go. (Eduard speaking foreign language) - Okay. (wind whistling) (grass rustling) - I'm running away and I'm gonna be a pilot. (wind howling) (prisoners cheering) (prisoners laughing) If I were a police officer, I would arrest that creepy Mr. Herman. Stupid coffee and calculated risk. (wind howling) (prisoners cheering) (prisoners laughing) (prisoners gasping) (prisoners cheering) (leaves crunching) - [Prisoner] There it is. (prisoners cheering) (leaves crunching) - Mister, please, no. - You German bastards killed my grandson. See, I knew you were working with the enemy. I just couldn't prove it until I got my hands on these. Huh? What is this? Trying to smuggle letters on the inside. What is that about? - My younger brother. He was left in Germany. - [Townie] You are a traitor! (fist thudding) (Luke groaning) - Tom, no. (wind howling) (grass rustling) (light dramatic music) My brother, he raised by our uncle, forced into the Wehrmacht. I just want to know if Martin is dead or alive. I'm not a traitor. I'm an American. Still, I love my brother. (dramatic music) - And I love my grandson. (suspenseful music) (prisoners cheering) - [Wade] Shoot him, Pa! - [Donny] What are you doing, Mr. Barrett? (dramatic music continues) - [Wade] Pa, please don't shoot the boy. - Donny! - Please don't hurt him. (dramatic music) (prisoners cheering) (suspenseful music) (Tom panting) - I'm sorry. Wade, I wronged you, and I'm so really sorry, son. Do you forgive me? - What are we gonna do? (dramatic music) (prisoners cheering) (gunshot banging) - Donny! Donny! (Donny panting) - They shot him! (soft music) (soft music continues) (soft music continues) (soft music continues) (car engine rumbling) - Hey, have you seen Donny? - Yeah, yeah, I've seen him. - Where? - Well, we, um, I saw him out on Orton Road. (car engine rumbling) (soft music continues) - Yes (speaking foreign language). - Hey. (prisoners speaking foreign language) (gunshot banging) All this good will to men, peace and art talk. You're up to something and I know it. - I, I don't understand, just... (body thumping) - Leave him alone, asshole. We are like you. We are all like you! (Eduard speaking foreign language) - What did you just say? I know you're spitting your Nazi poison. - I, I'm just a German, not a Nazi. I only wish to see my family again. Please, don't become what you wish to destroy. (light dramatic music) (light dramatic music continues) (light dramatic music continues) (light dramatic music continues) (prisoners chuckling) (prisoners speaking foreign language) (light dramatic music continues) (light dramatic music continues) - Sergeant. Gather the troops. - Yes, sir. (door slamming) (Lodell sighs) (wind whistling) - Hey, where's home boy? Where's home? Home. No, no, not play. Home. (leaves crunching) - [Lodell] Your name, soldier, for those who don't know you. - Sergeant Conrad Lewis of Brooklyn, New York, sir! - Are we not the one and only United States of America? - [Soldiers] Yes, sir. - Those uniforms that you all wear, they're a symbol of duty, honor, and sacrifice. But they're just a reflection of the soldier within. From now on, I expect your behavior to reflect the fine reputation that has become known for the United States military. Is that understood? - [Soldiers] Yes sir. - We are common men. But together we are capable of uncommon acts of courage, bravery and compassion. History will remember our actions for generations. We will determine how the world sees and remembers us. Dismissed. Find me Provost Marshal Klein, have him report to my office immediately. (light dramatic music) - Hey, hey. - I did this. - No, don't, don't do that to yourself. (Clara sniffling) Don't do that. - We can't lose him. - Hey, hey. We're gonna find him. Okay? Okay, we're gonna find him. (Clara crying) (somber music) (somber music continues) - Now, Donny has good common sense and I need to think that Buster's with him. - Yeah, he may have good common sense, but he doesn't have a coat on him. Okay, Buster can only help so much. (Clara crying) - Listen, listen to me. I know you're scared. But we're gonna find him. Okay, you have to believe me. I know we are, we're gonna find him. - [Clara] Okay. - Okay, come on boys. We are. Hurry up. Hurry up. Come on. Okay, okay, listen up everyone. We need to start west of the woods and work our way back to the river. We should be able to cover a lot of ground that way. What? Did you think I was just gonna sit back, serve coffee and fret? Absolutely not! Now, let's go! Let's find him! We have to find him! - All right, let's go. It's only gonna get colder out here. - God bless you all. - We're start on this road and work our way back. (wind whistling) - It's getting cold out there, sir. - I'm gonna get right to the point, Captain. Who organizes the tower shifts and the escort duties for this camp? - I do, sir. - Who do the men look to for guidance on their day-to-day duties and actions? - Sir, I'm not getting your line of questioning here. - I did not ask if you got my line of questioning. I asked, who do the men look to for guidance? Who sets the example of what kind of behavior is acceptable or tolerated? - Okay. Is this about the incident in the yard with a soccer ball? 'Cause I can explain that- - Enough, Captain. I swear if you dodge one more direct question, you're gonna be court-martialed: Insubordination. Do you understand me? - Me, sir. Yes, they look to me. It was a soccer ball, sir. Those men were being disrespectful. Herman Seip reported this, didn't he? You can't trust their reports, sir. These men are criminals. - No, I saw what happened. All of it. These men are prisoners of war. Many of 'em forced to fight in a conflict they wanted no part of. Do you know what the main requirement of leadership is? - No, sir. - The main requirement of leadership is that you must be a human being. The eyes of the world are upon us and how we perform our duty. Our own boys, our prisoners in German camps, and how we perform our duty may affect the way they're treated. Did that ever occur to you? - No, sir. - You have a brother that serves, yes? - Yes, sir, a B-17 pilot based in England. - And if he was shot down and taken captive, how would you want him to be treated? The golden rule, Captain, respect has to be earned. It cannot be demanded. You don't respect these men and therefore they don't respect you. You crossed a line and broke their trust. - [Linda] Sir. - Poor leadership. Poor leadership. You're no good to me anymore except to make an example out of you. You're hereby being transferred to another site. And Captain, I sincerely hope that you make better choices in the future. The train leaves 0700. Dismissed. - Yes, sir. - Yes, Linda? - Sir, Mayor Frank Hewitt called and said there's a local boy missing in the surrounded woods. - Tonight? In this? Who is it? - It's the young son of a Rudy Tietz. - Sergeant, step aside. (ominous music) - Yes, sir. (ominous music continues) (prisoners speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music continues) - Hold on here. (suspenseful music continues) - Whatever I've done to you, sir. I'm deeply sorry. - No, Eduard, I'm sorry. My actions were inexcusable. (light music) I sincerely hope that soon we can get back to our lives and our families. Accept my apology, please. (light dramatic music) (light dramatic music continues) (Eduard exhales) (Seip speaking foreign language) - Men, we need your help. (soft music) - [Donny] Please. (search crew indistinctly talking) - We should be able to cover a lot of ground that way. (soft music) (light dramatic music) (light dramatic music continues) (Seip speaking foreign language) - How can we help? (light dramatic music continues) - [Harriet] Donny! (indistinct yelling) - [Rudy] Come on, Donny! - Donny! Donny! - [Tom] Donny! - Donny! (muffled yelling) - [Harriet] Donny! (leaves crunching) Donny! (light eerie music) (Klaus speaking foreign language) (light music) Here, he's here! - We surrender, we surrender. - [Klaus] You okay? (light music continues) You're safe now. - [Alan] Let's get you home. - Thank you. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) - Is it Donny? Donny! (triumphant music) Oh, you scared me good. - [Donny] I'm sorry I ran away. - You're safe now. - I knew I should have taken my coat. - Yeah. - You always tell me to get my coat. - Yes, sir, you should have. Thank you. - Hey, I once knew a boy as brave as you. And he gave me this. Helped me through very hard times and I want you to have it. (gentle music) - Thank you. - [Rudy] Thank you. (gentle music continues) (leaves crunching) (light music) (Clara crying) - Donny! I'm sorry. We found you. (light music continues) (light music continues) (light music continues) (light music continues) (baby crying) (Clara hushes) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Come here, come here. Hero or no hero, kid, he needs his feet wiped. Hand me that rag. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. Thank you. I know. Yeah. It's okay boy. - Just gonna leave all that mess at the door, Donny? - I was gonna go back out with Buster after I got some hot chocolate. - Oh, we're out of hot chocolate. But we do have some coffee. If you'd like some. - Really? - We've been invited to go down to the PW camp for some Christmas presentation. - That sounds fun. - That sounds really nice. - Well then, looks like the Tietz family will be in attendance. (glasses clinking) My little man. (Clara giggling) ("O Holy Night") - [President Roosevelt] Here at home, we will celebrate in our traditional American way because of its deep spiritual meaning to us. Because the teachings of Christ are fundamental in our lives and because we want our youngest generation to grow up knowing the significance of this tradition, and the story of the coming of the immortal prince of peace and goodwill. But in perhaps every home in the United States, sad and anxious thoughts will be continually with the millions of our loved ones who are suffering hardships and misery, who are risking their very lives to preserve for us and for all mankind the fruits of his teachings and the foundations of civilization itself. The Christmas spirit lives tonight in the bitter cold of the front lines in Europe, and in the heat of the jungles and swamps of Burma and the Pacific Islands. (Sally sighs) Even the roar of our- - Well, you better go get cleaned up. - [President Roosevelt] The guns of our ships at sea. - I mean, if you wanted to go to the Christmas gala. - Really? - Yeah. - Oh! Thank you. - All right, hurry up. - [President Roosevelt] Around our Christmas tree. ("O Holy Night" continues) ("O Holy Night" continues) (prisoner speaking foreign language) (townspeople talking over each other) - It's a beautiful night for a surprise. - Yeah, this is the most fun I have had in a very long time. - You good? - I'm good. - Are you warm? - Yeah, I'm warm. - All right, we gotta keep you warm. - I'll keep warm. - They should be out in a minute. - Oh, Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. (indistinct whispering) - It truly did. I can't thank you for everything that you did for me and for my family. (indistinct talking) Is he warm enough? (lips smacking) - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. I love you. - I love you too. (prisoners singing in foreign language) (prisoners singing in foreign language continues) (singing in foreign language continues) (singing in foreign language continues) (singing in foreign language continues) - Welcome, everyone. Thank you for coming out tonight on this Christmas Eve of 1944. We're here to celebrate an opportunity for peace in this world. These men, who are so far from their home, have created something for our home, and hopefully it'll be with us for many years to come. So with the Christmas spirit, I pray for peace on earth. ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm ♪ ♪ All is bright ♪ ♪ Round yon virgin mother and child ♪ ♪ Holy infant so tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ - Please come and see this symbol of peace. ("Silent Night") ("Silent Night" continues) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) - [President Roosevelt] We all know how anxious they are to be home with us, and they know how anxious we are to have them. And how determined every one of us is to make their day of homecoming as early as possible. And above all, they know the determination of all right thinking people and nations, that Christmases such as those that we have known in these years of world tragedy shall not come back again to beset the souls of the children of God. (gentle music) ("America the Beautiful") ("America the Beautiful" continues) ("America the Beautiful" continues) ("America the Beautiful" continues) ("America the Beautiful" continues) ("America the Beautiful" continues) - Mr. And Mrs. Kaib. Good morning. I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Don Tietz. And Kim, our local news reporter. - [Kim] Nice to meet you. - Yes, when I was a young boy, I remember your men working on my dad's farm. I recall them being so nice to us, so thank you. - Thank you. - Mr. Kaib, how does it feel to return to the very spot where you were once imprisoned? - I find this second visit to Algona to be much more pleasurable than the first. I've seen more of the town this time. Would you care to walk with me to where the camp was? - [Don] Yeah. - Yes. (drums beating) (light music) - Mr. Kaib, what was behind such a huge endeavor as the nativity scene? (light music continues) (light music continues) (light music continues) (light music continues) - [Eduard] I never intended to create a piece of art.
