- Shut up. - All right. Seriously, who are you and what have you done with my girlfriend? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! This is so beautiful! Hey, you're getting snow all over the carpet. I thought you grew up around here. - ♪ House party ♪ - Oh, my God. - You gonna help me? - ♪ House party ♪ ♪ Party's over here party's over here ♪ You're not gonna help me. Go find the water heater or something. - You're not invited - Make yourself useful. - ♪ You're not invited ♪ - Jesus Christ. Help me out. It's like I'm dating a pinball machine. Honey, it's fine. - I'm sure she's fine. - I'm just worried. What if they're actually not feeding her or something? Isn't it like a chichi place? Don't they send you photos of the dogs getting manicures so you know they're okay? I know, but Selena's a very... It's two days. It's literally two days, okay? Chihuahua's not gonna starve to death. You need to chill, all right? You're being very LA right now. Do not tell me to chill. Okay. I'm saying, hey, aren't you seeing them this weekend? We'll knock him out. Dude's a faggot. He's got nothing. It was a cheap shot. - Hey, you coming? - Excuse me. You guys, where are we going? We're going to Porter's? Excuse me. Please don't do this. You mind keeping it down? What's up? We're eating. You mind keeping it down? - Yeah, and we're talking. - I noticed. You're using some pretty nasty slurs there, tough guy. - PJ! PJ, please. - What's up? - You got a problem with me? - No, I got a question. Is it gonna be a rude question? No, it's not. Okay, what's your question? You guys have the Internet in this town? You should try it out, it's fantastic. You could teach your moms how to read. Hey, stop. Look, we're sorry. You have a nice night, all right? That was extremely, extremely stupid of you. It's just that word. It's just that one word, I wouldn't have said anything. What if my brother was here? I'm sorry, I shouldn't have... I know. I know. "First knob on your left. Can't miss it." Clearly, I can miss it. Fuck! Will you go start the shower? You're so hot. - Will you whistle for me? - Yeah. I'm gonna close this. Okay. Brianne? Brianne? Brianne? 911, what's your emergency? Hi, I'm John. I'm an alcoholic. Hi, John. I see a couple of new faces here. Welcome. I've been with the program now for six years. Sober for three. We're no saints. Yeah, that's right. We're no saints. I got drunk for the first time, I was 15 years old and I turned to the kid next to me, I guess, and I said, "This is what normal people must feel like." I'm not good with anger. Backseat drivers. My ex-wife, she, uh... Woof. You met her. She's the mother of my daughter, I can never say a cross word against her, but she can be a real fucking piece of work. Some nights I get so angry even just thinking about it, I get these crazy ideas about renting a backhoe, setting it up on her lawn, putting it in drive and just watching it crawl through her house slowly. Not to hurt anybody, obviously, but just to have somebody acknowledge that I'm here. Ronnie made oatmeal cookies. So, everybody thank Ronnie. Yeah, sure, dive in. But I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the 12 Steps. And I'm living proof that if you can just focus... If you can just focus and not let the monsters inside of you come out... If you can just concentrate on the 12 Steps and becoming a better person every day... ...then you can... What's the problem? What's the problem? I don't hear people. We getting prints here? Uh, yes, Sheriff. We've got hers and the boyfriend's. But they're also collecting them in the house right now. It's a rental, so there's hundreds. Any neighbors? We got people knocking. - I know this family over here. - Oh. Any signs of sexual abuse? Could you have Officer Robson fill you in on that, Sheriff? We have a lot of work here. You can answer that question. I may look old but I can handle it. Any sign of sexual abuse? Sheriff, that part of the crime scene is missing at the moment. Do you mind speaking to Officer Robson about that? Oh. Uh... We gotta shut down the road. Yes, sir. We're working on it. Uh... Help me get out of here. Yeah. Hey, can we get a car for Sheriff? Got it. So what else we got here? We notify the families? We're still collecting here. We got someone to head to the 76 to pull tapes from the seats. What happened to the boyfriend? Oh, we put him in a cruiser back to the city. Never heard somebody say "Oh, my God" so many times. Gotta call Jenna. - Why is that? - What? Why do you have to call your daughter? I didn't say that. Did I? Okay, I need everybody's cooperation. No, we're cooperating. You're not cooperating, okay? Can we have somebody else talk to us? You don't know what you're talking about. - No, which is illegal. What am I gonna have to do? Rent this place out as a haunted house? My wife's gonna fucking kill me. Excuse me. They said there was a chemical spill. Are my dogs gonna be okay? I'm sorry. They said what? I did say it was a chemical spill. Ma'am, your dogs are gonna be fine. Will you two keep me in on this? Yeah. Never a dull moment. Hell of a last quarter for you, Sheriff. God, I thought it was a car accident. You get this guy, bring him in and get everybody on it. I'm not sure we gotta... You know what... Yeah, thank you so much, Sheriff. We're gonna look into that. Now we have only about one homicide every two years. This is an isolated incident. We are making strides to find suspects, so no one in Snow Hollow should be worried about this. District Attorney's office is gonna bring these killers to justice. All right, now let me hear what you got. Read that back. "Currently pursuing all leads, isolated incident. Police making strides." Yeah, that's good. Okay. When are you gonna publish that? Well, we're weekly. So, I mean, tomorrow. Good. Hey, Sheriff, anything else you can tell us? I mean, some of your guys are calling this a massacre. Massacre? Wait a minute. Who said that? Not one of my guys. No, I'm afraid we can't. Sorry, boys. We'll see you in the basement on Sunday? I don't know. Are you gonna catch these guys? Hundred percent. You can take that to the bank. I'll see you in the basement, Ricky. Yeah, let's hope so. - Wait, wait. Hey, Ricky. - No, Sheriff. What are all these little comments? - Why you doing this? - Sheriff. - I hear these things. - Sheriff. Sheriff. Sorry, Sheriff. I got a nine-year-old. Well, you're acting like a nine-year-old. This is a tragedy. Now just publish your damn story already and, uh, have a nice day. Shut the door. Did they notice anything? Did I seem together? You did fine. Oh, I feel like I've been having a heart attack. No, you did fine. Wait, you said you feel like you're having a heart attack right now? No, since about August. Did I do all right? I don't want them to think I was, you know... Dad, you did fine. I take you're not gonna slow me down. Look at that photograph out there all blown up. Good guys locking up the bad guys. There's the old crowd. Yeah, I remember a bank robbery in 1979. Got the head man on the phone. He was so mad. Got his daughter down here, put her on the bullhorn. He cried like a baby, went to pieces. They marched out single-file, hands in the air. That was 40 something years ago. Went like that. You're gonna have a hard time getting my generation off the stage. Willie Nelson's still doing concerts. Yeah, I mean, to be fair, Dad, Willie Nelson is a guitar player and he's not doing a lot of heavy police work. This is scary. It's new. I never saw a body like that. It's a murder. It's nothing new. Treat it like a murder. You get the team together, all right? You get all the guys together. You handle them, I'll handle everything else. Oh, my God. What is this? Eleven new emails on this thing this morning. Jesus Christ, this is worse than my birthday. So he was being confrontational? Yeah, I mean they were renters. We thought they were in town for Mall Park and all with the slopes opening, but they just wanted to be rude to people. All right, but he was being confrontational? Yeah, I mean, he got all pissed off 'cause I called my buddy an asshole. And then, you know, he's trying to act all tough. I mean, honestly, I'm not surprised with this happening here, you know, 'cause it's been stirring up for a while now. Wh-What did you say back to him? I didn't say shit. I said, "Have a nice evening." I mean, we had some drinking to do. We went on to Porter's and then we walked home. Yeah, and he's got receipts, too. Show her your receipts. - Yeah, I take pictures of 'em. - You got receipts? - Oh. - Don't swipe left. - Yeah. - Uh-uh. I'm sorry. Hold up. Am I a suspect here? Because, I mean, if you want to show me a warrant, then I'll show you everything in my phone all you want, but otherwise we got work to do. Are we good? I didn't kill that girl. Have a nice day. Bitch. Our guys come out the woods, grab her by the tub. Move her from the deck to the lawn. And by that time, she couldn't scream. Okay. Which is consistent with the blood spatter on the siding there. Now, they remove her, uh, parts, uh, bag 'em and exit on foot 'cause there's no tire prints. Unless they parked on the hill. The footprints are canine. No, it's not an animal. You'd need a knife or specialized claws, you'd need thumbs for that, and you don't have a getaway driver if you're a serial killer. D.C. Sniper. - Yeah, that was different. - Still serial. Yeah, that was different. So the victim turns off the hot water valve, thinking it's for the hot tub. Then she's attacked. They remove her vagina. The killer must have been waiting along this fence. He must've been watching. My heart goes out to the boyfriend. It's like the ultimate blue balls story, fellas. It was a full moon last night. How are we doing here, fellas? Tonight, too. Uh, just the check, Laura. You guys are gonna find this monster, right? That's right. Ain't got nothing to worry about. We'll find him. You just tell your boss to keep focusing on making her interesting dessert recipes. I can hear you out there, Ray. Asshole talking about my cooking. Why the hell did you let me get married? I told you not to. We all told you. Can't be married and focus on your career. Tell me about the neighbors and the fight at the restaurant. Yeah, Julia said the fight was innocent. Most of the neighbors are out for the winter. Homeowner story checks out. Letting us take over the property. They own that place on Maple with all that Japanese bullshit on the lawn. What is that shit? You know what I'm talking about? It's a rock garden. You never seen a rock garden before? No, my ears are still ringing from his wife fucking chewing me out. Tell me about the victim. She used to live out here? Yeah, went to the elementary. I'm meeting with the administration tomorrow. Okay. Start making calls. Anybody that's seen anything suspicious. Like at the post office, Porter's, knife sharpeners, anything. My money is on this guy hunts elk. Something he can field dress in no time. Don't bother Sheriff about this. We got ski season to think about. Everything goes through me, then Sheriff, then town hall. Got it? No, we don't got anything. Let state handle it. The feds handle it. All right? It's an animal. I got drunk drivers to deal with. Are you serious? This is what everybody's talking about right now. You want people to stop talking shit about the police? Do better police work. We don't do this shit, all right? Somebody's gonna handle it. Don't say "somebody." That somebody is us. When you say "somebody" that means "nobody." Look, it's a one-off. It's an ex-boyfriend trying to make it look like a serial. Maybe it is a wolf. A wolf doesn't cut a fucking internal organ out. But why would he take the parts out of her? Make it look like a serial. Why did he take the parts off of her? To eat 'em. I don't know. Make a Fleshlight out of 'em. I don't know. This whole thing's gonna be done in a week. They're gonna incriminate somebody through their texts, or their Facebook messages. It's the 21st century. Don't... Don't start with this shit, John. All right? Let the FBI find him. Right? Right. All right. So just little side to side like this, you know, get loose with it. And get used to putting your weight on your front foot too, right? And just look where you wanna go. And just remember, dudes, it's snow. Worst that'll happen is you'll fall on your butt. Yeah, and it hurts. What's your name? Jordan? Jordan, I used to suck. In fact, at one point, I sucked worse than you do. And that's difficult. All right, y'all ready? Let's do this. - Good night, Andrea. - Night. You going to the Over All-Nighter? No. Um... I'm not. I'm doing something else. Josh has this cooker, and I told him I would go by. I thought we did this. I thought we were done with him. I mean, me too, I get it. I don't know what you want me to say. That you're not gonna hang out with guys who treat you badly. That'd be nice. Yeah, how about next time I let you choose the one boy in town who likes me? No! Do not text me to tell me that you might not be able to make it to her orientation. They say if you don't catch the guy within the first 48 hours, you're never gonna catch him. Okay, well, she's gonna be a lot safer living with me than she will be with you in Upperville, and that's for sure. Hi, sweetie, how are you? Can I get you something? - Hey, Dad. - Yeah, coffee. She's gonna need help with her move. So, are you gonna be supportive or not? Hi, Brittany. Jenna, like I said in that voicemail, there's gonna be a lot of late nights and overtime because of the brutal murder that happened in town. And I gotta catch the guy, and I didn't wanna set up expectations that I can't keep. Oh, no. Our expectations of you are very low. She is 17 and starting college with a gymnastics scholarship. It is a big deal. I need to make sure you're gonna be there. Yes. Brittany, I'm gonna be there, okay? How much coffee have you had today? Can we not do this at Bonanza's? Jesus Christ, I'd have a nicer time at Abu Ghraib. Thank you so much. Help me! John. What? Oh. Shut down the mountain. Get these fucking cars out of here. Call your people. We need this parking lot. - John. - It's another young woman. John, they're saying it's a big bear, big jaw or something. No, it's a man. When do I get to be right about something? With canine's lower mandible. That's what they're saying. Get 'em on the phone. I'm not listening to that. I got 'em on the phone. I'm telling you what they're saying. Hey! You can't park that here. You can't park that here. We need you 500 feet away at least. It's a crime scene. Just park on Elm Street. It's just the press, boss. They got Monica Bravo out here. Who the fuck called the news? - Hey, John? - John. Not everybody talk to me at once, okay? Yes, sorry, Brittany. I'm going to be there January 28th. Do not fucking call me again, okay? Do not call me. I'm at work. I just wanted to know if you're gonna be there. Who's the victim? Is she local? Looks like it. We gotta get a van to pull her out of here. All right. Hey, do we have anybody of our guys in a van? John, we're gonna need fingerprints. Her top is gone. Her what? Her head. Her head is gone. Got it. - John. John? - Yeah. Got bites on the neck and on her arms, too. I can't hear you! You gotta fucking speak up! They're saying it's a wolf! Bo, come take a walk with me. Get State Forensics out here. I don't wanna talk to them on the phone ever again. Get them on the fucking crime scene. Yeah, Bo, come take a walk. Let's have a little chat. Lord and God, you're the source of life. Keep us in life and death and your love. Now let us listen to the words of the Lord in the holy scripture, that gives us reassurance of the Lord's love for us in life and death. What'd you wanna talk about? No! No! - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! - John, stop it! Where were you? Where were you? Yeah, fuck you. Where were the cops? Sitting there in your little suit. When are you gonna get this fucking thing, huh? - I'm sorry. - Don't be! Find it! Find it! John. John. John! - Huh? - Can I get a signature? Oh, yeah. All right. Thanks. All right. I'm closing her up. Mayor wants a word. State Attorney's office called. Wanted info 'cause the election's coming up. Oh, I can't do that shit right now. You wrap out. I can't wrap this out. Yeah, I got fucking Sheriff calling me. Jenna's... Look, just wrap up the crime scene, I'll handle the town. This is a relationship. Does that sound good to you? Yes. Good. Wrap out. Another young woman, right? Oh, brilliant fucking detective work, Chavez. Well, it was a full moon again last night. Oh, cut it out with that goddamn Roswell shit, Chavez! Wrap out! The streets should have been bustling with tourists. But not today. And not since the violent murders of two young women left a stain on a small mountain town and its law enforcement. What will it take for Snow Hollow, Utah, to regain the reputation of the fun-loving ski capital of the town? Sir, if you had one message to the local police department, what would you have to say? I'd say to the local police department, you gotta find this guy or girl, I don't know, I don't know what it is. But you gotta find this guy, you take him out. 'Cause I'm not paying any more taxes in this town. Oh, jeez. Excuse me, would you mind taking that down? I'd rather not have people see that. I don't choose what goes up. All right, just take down the first part, please. Darren decides what goes up. I just fill it out. Oh. Darren decides that? Hey, is this your? I like those. Expired plates though. I don't think Darren would mind. No, I don't think he will. Thank you so much. You have a good day. Hi, Carla. For me? It's a gift from Bo. Oh. Wow. This is really great. This is really special. But I already filed the paperwork, so I need you to get out of the building in the next 20 minutes 'cause you're not gonna be working here anymore. Maybe look into getting a job at WikiLeaks. I hear they might be hiring soon. Sorry about that... Sorry about that. What do you got for us, John? Hangover. What did you say? I said anger issues. I think you said something else. No. No, I didn't. That's cute. I think we ought to bring in someone with expertise on exotic animals. No. No, we're not gonna do that. 'Cause that's insane. All right, then you figure it out. It's a wolf. Or maybe it's a werewolf. I've been watching a lot of History Channel lately... No. Chavez, it's... Sorry. Everybody, let me just make this perfectly clear. There is no such thing as werewolves. They're imaginary. Our killer is a guy. And I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna kill... Wow. And we're gonna bring him to justice, legally and together. She has pawprints and hair. Yeah, sorry, Chavez. Please enlighten us. Did you take forensic psychology at your college online? - Fuck you, asshole. - Out. - Fuck you. Yeah. - What? Dumbass. Keep walking. - Yeah, all right, tough guy. - You wanna go? Yeah, oh, like you're always... - John! - All right. John McEnroe. Team is with you. They got no dog in this fight. You want leadership? Lead. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Julia. Medical examiner's report please. Officer Robson. Thank you, John. Animal hair is part pit bull but that's 'cause Hannah was a dog owner. Rest of the hair is all grey wolf. Lab is still working on it. But it's possible that a pack of wolves visited our crime scene between her murder and our arrival, but that seems unlikely. Teeth are consistent with a wolf, so if anybody sees that Michael J. Fox guy walking around, let me know. Yeah, everybody laughs till she lays out the crime scene photos. Genitals were intact in the second victim. Everything was intact, generally speaking, except for her head, which was taken. Canine bites on her arms and back. She fought like hell. Spans of the bites are gigantic. Same as the distance of the paw prints. State Forensics say it's the size of a Kodiak bear, or something that could hold her down with its mouth. No saliva, no DNA, apart from the hair. All the blood was hers. Our killer doesn't leave much behind. Of his own, that is. Hey, honey. Hey, Dad. Is this that biology thing? Calculus. All right. Did you need any help with that? Or... Nope. Sure. I'm having a hard time with this thing, honey. It's nothing you have to worry about. I'm gonna find the guy, obviously. But I'm just curious if you still have that pepper spray that I got you for communion. Um, I think so. You realize that was a weird gift to give somebody, right? I do. It's okay. You'll never need it. But I want you to promise me that you're gonna find it and keep it on you at all times. What's wrong? Nothing. Dad, you know how many people die in Utah from tobacco every year? Yeah, I saw your post about that and that's really interesting, honey, but those people didn't die like this. And I just get nervous with the way that you dress. How do I dress? Perfectly reasonably. I've just seen the way that people look at you, women included. I think you'll understand when you have children of your own. I don't want children. Dad, you're not the only person in charge of protecting the town. You're not Rikki-Tikki-Tavi and you're not Grandpa, okay? Why are you acting like this? Well, Dad never got any gymnastics medals growing up, honey, so I guess I'm just trying to catch up to you. Do you think maybe this could be about your mom leaving you when you were a kid? No. And maybe you're thinking that if you catch the guy, you'll be able to prove her wrong. No. No, I don't think that, frankly. I thought we were doing your math homework. Will you just... I'm trying to have a normal conversation with you. All right. So... I'm taking off. So the state police are unhappy. Forensically speaking, there's not a whole lot of evidence for 'em and they got city cases to solve. I called Quantico but it takes two months for the application to go through. and if the murders didn't take place on a federal highway, the FBI can't even come in. Did you know that? And I hate to say we'll catch him, but we'll catch him. He'll slip up. Most times it's them. Every time it's them. You think it's a guy, right? You don't... You don't think it's like an animal - or something? - No. Yeah, it's a guy. I mean, it's wolf prints but do you have to ask? I don't know. Chavez seems to think it's something else. Yeah, well, Chavez thinks Men in Black is a documentary. Eh, maybe you're right. Let's do a stakeout. I hear serial killers sometimes return to the crime scene. What was that? Beer bottle. Beer bottle? Who would wanna throw a beer bottle at a cop car? She's harmless. Come in. ...on a small mountain town and its law enforcement. What will it take for Snow Hollow, Utah, to regain the reputation of the fun-loving... Skipping town? Yeah. Well, no. Just Orange County. Gotta keep moving, you know. For Mom. You stop moving, you start thinking. They got a clinic out there for stuff like me. I didn't kill Brianne, if that's what you're wondering. Yeah, we know that. State police didn't, so Mom said I should just make that clear. That's state. Yeah. Cool. So why are you bothering me? Hmm? You came all the way down here. That must mean you still haven't found anything. Hmm? You must really not have a clue. Am I right? I thought you would have found this guy by now. See, this is why people talk shit about the police. Sorry, but... We were wondering if maybe you remember anything suspicious about that night that might've come to you since we last spoke, or something from your relationship - with Brianne that might've... - No. Dropped the bags. Restaurant. Went back to the house. And, no, I didn't see a goddamn werewolf. This takes cooperation. Oh, I'm cooperating. This could've been a phone call. How many people on your team and you still haven't found this guy? - Did you see anybody tall? - I saw nothing! Nothing! I've done this 25 times and it sucks every fucking time. Something... Just leave me alone. She was a beauty queen. Brianne. We came to give you back the possessions we took. No, I don't want that shit. Get that shit away from me. - Mom, I don't want that shit. - PJ. We'll take that. No, they could've called me and they could've asked me if I wanted it. I don't... Mom. I'm just gonna... I'm gonna leave my card... right here. Hey, Officer? If you do find him... don't arrest him. Shoot him. Shoot him till you can see the ground through his face. What are you doing? You playing with sugar? You're so silly. Here. I'll make it easier for you. You mind if I sit here? Yeah, that's fine. Go for it. How old is she? Um, she's three. She's beautiful. Thank you. You're so pretty. Y'all live around here? Uh, yeah. Just up Fox Farm. Oh, Fox Farm. It's a good neighborhood. Yeah, I mean, we like it. We grew up there and went to the elementary school and everything so... Oh, that's great. I used to work with them. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Would've been years ago. - Liz? - Yeah, over here. Thank you. They used to have me give presentations there. That's great. And you're gonna send her to the elementary, too? My husband and I will, yeah. Thank you so much. That blue car is nice, huh? I've been seeing the ads for 'em. Yeah, uh, we like it. It's a big back seat. Baby on board now, so... Is your hair always that color? It is. Um, I'm sorry. They put onions on here. Will you excuse me? I just have to take care of it. Yeah, okay. It's nice meeting you. Yeah, you as well. Okay, come on, sweetie, let's go. Um, excuse me, can I borrow your telephone for a moment, please? I think I'd like to call the police. Sorry to make you retell it, but just so everyone can hear, would you mind recounting it for everybody? It was definitely him. He was weird and I could tell it was him. And I've never met anybody like that around here really, and I know he was local because he said "y'all." And he was really big. - How tall? - I don't know. But he was big. And he kind of smelled like a dark room. Like the kind they use for photography. I don't even know why you brought me in here. Randall. He works in the back. He works in the meat department. I don't know where he gets all that meat. You should talk to him. Do not call me a sex worker. You know how offensive that is? I don't even do that shit anymore. Yeah. Yes. Yes. I own a lot of properties, okay? You're not gonna pin this thing on me, all right? I already talked to half the goddamn staff here. Now can someone let me call my fucking wife? Please? You've gotta get your shit together. I could've fucking solved this thing by now. I was out of my house. I heard this noise and I saw this shape. It was big. It was a big woman. He wanted to know about Miley and how old she was. And he knew what car I'd driven. He knew that I'd driven there. He had had blood here... - She was big. - ...and on a newspaper... Cool if I smoke in here? I'm like, "Dude, we don't sell goat's milk. We sell cow's milk." He's like, "I want goat's milk. I want goat's milk now." The newspaper that he had the drill. Stop. I'm done. I haven't done anything. Please just get me the lawyer. Sixth Amendment. I want a phone call. Did you notice if he took anything from your table? Like a receipt? I'm talking even something small. No. Late 20s to... Um... I don't know. Maybe early 50s. Maybe. I don't know. I mean... he had his hood up. And it was hot in there. Well, thank you for bringing this to our attention, Mrs. Fairchild. We'll have our offices call you if we need anything else. Wait. Do you think it could've been him? Maybe. Thanks for coming in. I got something. I know who the Snow Hollow wolfman is. Great. We wanna hear all about it. Hey, Dave. How are we looking? Clean bill of health. Said I should check back next summer. It's a heart murmur. - Goddamn it! - Bullshit. Bullshit. There's a great facility at General. - Bullshit. - Dave. Out. All right, look, he said I was fine just before you got in here. Guy's not even a real doctor. What are you doing? I'm fine. I don't know what he's talking about. No, you're not. Just work from home. Nobody gives a shit if you work from home. The only person that cares is you. - Really? - Yeah. I got this. No, you don't. You can't steamroll me out of here with all this going on. - That is ageism, no siree. - Ageism. I wanna know about those interviews. Yeah, I mean, they're actually going pretty great. Uh, couple of local call girls, some survivors' testimonies... No! Hey! I'm not doing this! Stand up! Goddamn it! You have any idea what you're putting me through with this goddamn stress? I wake up in the middle of the night, the phone's ringing! The first thing that I think is that somebody's calling me to tell me that you're dead! Oh, you're the victim. I got it now. - It's a fucking nightmare! - All about you. Goddamn it! Just go to a doctor! I'm not doing this shit anymore! I'm not a child! You don't trust that I know myself. No, I trust you. Trust you being a complete fucking asshole about this. All right, I'm an asshole. I'm gonna work on that. We done with that? All right? Finished? Now, tell me about those interviews. Ahh! Ahh! All right. Hey. We're looking for somebody big. No! I want license plates out of everybody that came out of that cafe. Do you have anything? Fingerprints? Blood? Fucking anything? There's a lot of blood. It's just me and Kevin down here. I've never worked with a body like this... Don't email us saying you got nothing. What the fuck is County paying you for? No! - That is your job. - I'm a medical examiner. That is your job. That is your job. I analyze data. Your job is to find the suspects. God, we thank thee for the life that you give us. It is full of work, responsibility and joy. Get off of me! Today, we thank thee for the lives of Miley and Liz. Help us in our mourning and teach us to live for the living... So our guy kills a deer, he drags it out here, lays it in the middle of the road. He has a handprint on it, so he cuts a patch off of it to get rid of the handprint... Wait, how do you know it's a handprint? There's a patch missing from the deer. He must have put a handprint down and then cut it off so that we couldn't find it. What if it's a hunter without a license? A hunter without a license? Come fucking tell me it's a hunter without a license. - Come over here and tell me... - It's a perfectly... No! No! I wanna hear your theory. Tell me right here that it's a hunter without a license. I wanna hear this. This is gonna be great. It's a hunter without a license. You're a bad police officer. You should've pursued computer science because you are not good at this. I'm a father. No, you're not. Is there any way you can make just my room warmer? There's a way to make just you warmer. Put on a sweater. So what is a werewolf? Story comes from the Middle Ages. These townspeople would find a woman's body in the woods, just decimated and they say, "It couldn't have been a man. Had to be a monster." It's actually just men. These guys who get angry every once in a while and take it out on women. Because they hate them. There's no magic, there's no transformation. In fact, the only reason it happens on a full moon is because it was bright enough to be able to sneak up and kill somebody. Oh. Hi, I'm calling from the Sheriff's department. I'm wondering if you guys keep records of anybody that might've worked for the school from about 1970 No, this has nothing to do with the murder investigation. This is actually a new investigation of a serial arsonist who's been setting fire to local nosy people's automobiles, actually. So are you gonna give us those yearbooks, or what's going on? Victims are always women and the killers - are always men. - Hmm. Why is it always women? You think women have had to deal with shit like this since the Middle Ages? So he didn't tie her up. He didn't lure her into his car or something like that. It's a hunt. It's a thrill for him. She's a trophy. And he parked his car in the back of the cafe so the security cameras at the bank don't catch him in the parking lot. - He must be local. - Could be no. If he were local, why didn't he use the front Have we checked them? I checked them. How does nobody else see this guy? "Lycanthropy is affected by the moon's light... and depending on the moon's breadth..." John? John! Ahh! Oh, fuck you! I'm sorry. I... I didn't know you were sleeping. Well, I'm wide awake now! What can I do for you? Well, somebody's been calling you on your walkie-talkie. I don't know what to do. All right. - Thank you so much. - Yeah. And, hey, Ray, quick librarian note. Yeah, yeah. A police officer asks you to take out all the spooky books in a library, maybe don't sneak up on him. I'm sorry, John. No, it's fine. Thank you for doing that. But had that been another member of my team, what you just pulled right there, that could've ended in a shooting. Oh, wow, really? Yeah, and that would've been lights out for Ray. So, just... for next time. Go for John. So, yeah, we had one of our office temps listen to them. They didn't know what to make of them. They're all saved here in her machine. Y'all get some coffee? Hello. Hi, Liz. I called you earlier and you picked up. I'd like to check the cost of toner for my printer system. Ugh. Sounds like he's touching himself. Stop talking. I'm calling because we spoke earlier and I'm looking to provide new toner for all of my businesses. I'll call back, or let me know with whom I can speak. Yeah, yeah. I guess that's everything. "We spoke earlier." Who pays the phone bill around here? "With whom." He said, "With whom," right? It sounds like he's on a highway. Play it again. All the calls came from that same number. He hung up on the rest. Are you even sure it's him? Yeah, we're pretty sure it's him. Oh, it's definitely him. Thank you so much for bringing this to our attention. You're not gonna tell anybody about this, otherwise it could be your fault - if we don't catch the guy. - My fault? How could any of this be my fault? Yeah, um, thank you. We're again all so sorry for your loss. It's wiped clean. Maybe from the snow. I don't know. - I'm not getting anything. - All right, you keep working. I'm gonna have somebody come by and hacksaw it off the slab. Look, John, if he's gonna pull prints off of a deer carcass, he's not gonna leave them here. Do your job! Do your job! I am begging you! You have anything else you need to do today? No? Good! Do your job! It's like kindergarten. Utah. A curfew is in effect tonight in the town of Snow Hollow due to the ongoing unsolved murder cases that many are calling the Snow Hollow Horror. The Sheriff's Department has declined to comment to Eyewitness Five. We have every reason to believe that this monster will show up again tonight. All right. We will have radio silence until we can be certain. I want all cars on their tens. - Fuck! - Is that understood? Yes, sir. When the call comes in, make it clear, make it obvious. Tell us the address. You will have instant backup. I won't ask you to pray with me 'cause of the goddamn lawyers. Let's have a moment of silence. Let's hear it. Hurrah! Hey, hey, hey. Sit down. Come here, come here. It's okay, it's okay. Just get in the chair, I'll be all right. - No, no. - I'm all right. I'm calling an EMT and you're going in tonight. Why didn't you just tell somebody you needed help? Why didn't you stay at home? - I can still do it. - No. Dad, stop. That's it. I'm done. I can't do this anymore. It's over. You're retired. I'm through. Go get him. Yeah. Carla, call an ambulance. Sheriff's gotta go to the hospital tonight. He has a heart murmur and you can't fucking tell anybody about it, okay? Please just fucking do this for me, I can't do it myself. I've got this. Yeah? I got it. Yeah, all right. Um... Okay. Tell him, uh... It's okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. Okay. And now there's the whole curfew thing. Why should I? Oh, my God! - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh... I'm coming over right now. I love you. - Okay, bye. I love you. - Yeah, bye. Are you sure we're good here? Yes, I'm sure. Stop worrying. What if somebody sees us? No one's gonna see us. We're not supposed to be out here right now. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. We're fine, okay? If we get in trouble, it's on you. Okay? Squeeze me. You sure? Pretty sure. Oh, shit. Shit, shit. Fuck. - What? - It's the neighbor. - Put your pants on. - What? Neighbor, sorry. What? Station for one. Go for John. Fox Creek and Hyde. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Start the car. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Start the car. Start it! Start it now! - Damn it! - Dad! Jenna. What are you doing here? I don't know. I was with Brock. Where's Brock at? I don't know. I don't know. He left you? Jenna, you can't do this. I can't be worrying about you like this. I'm at work right now. You're not even gonna ask if I'm okay? No, I'm not gonna ask if you're okay! You're supposed to be at home right now! You're breaking curfew, making out with some guy in a fucking truck, almost getting murdered in the street! Goddamn it! Do you have any idea what your mom's gonna say about me? Oh, fuck you. Fucking asshole. Fucking wannabe. Go back to your conference! I've been looking at the back of your head for the last 17 years, Dad! Fucking unbelievable! You never said, "Congratulations. Good job. I'm so proud of you." You did shit! I'm going to college and I cannot wait to stay with other people! I'd rather live with strangers than be with you! Officer Gutierrez here. I'm in pursuit. I'm bleeding from the skull. Take me to the fucking hospital! Hey, I need backup. Who do you think you are? Get out of this house! Oh, my God, get out of here! Oh, my God, get out of this house! What are you doing in here? Get out! Get out of here! Oh, my God! Who do you think you are? Get out of here! Get out! - Stop! Stop! - Get out of here! Brock! Get off of him! Brock! Get off of him! Get off of him! Get off of him! Stay back. Stay back. What did you do? - Jesus! - Why is he here? What did you do to that poor girl? Dad? Hey, sweetie. How's your head? No. Dad. Where have you been? I was protecting the family. What do you mean I'm not invited? Since when is anybody not invited? It's probably not a good idea right now. Ben, it's me you're talking to. If it were Ricky, I understand, but it's me. I'm hearing you. No, you're not hearing me, because you keep fucking putting your hand up and not letting me in. Do the steps. Just do the steps. I'm about to step to you right now. Hey, John. Hey, Carla. How are you? You're parked in the middle of the street, honey. Am I really? - Did somebody call you? - They did. Hey, we love you, John. Oh, yeah? Everybody loves me? That's great. Why don't you call the fucking Tribune and tell them how much you... Hey, Dean, you gotta She doesn't know what she's talking about. Man, hey, come on. She's an amateur sleuth. She has none of the evidence. In fact, tell your wife I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I slept for an hour in a corner. I keep thinking he's gonna be in here. Did you want me to move it? I bet you're not gonna let me, huh? No, I bet I'm not. Dad? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Dad, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What are you covered in? It's from the car. Did you crash your car? No. Relax. I was pulling out of the station and my headlights clipped a column on the way out. And I got so angry about it I just drove as fast as I could into the column. This is from the airbags. Come on! Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, it's all okay. Just let me lay down up here for a minute. Just let me lay down up here for a minute, honey. No, you have to... Just let me lay down here for a minute. Dad! Come on! - Okay. - Dad! Okay. Okay. Please! Okay, I'm coming, I'm coming. I told him I'd catch him and I didn't. I looked him in the face and I told him I'd catch him and I was drunk. Just go to bed! Please just go to bed. Don't tell me to go to bed. I don't need a parent. 39 years old, I'm stuck in Summit County being a fucking asshole. I am an asshole! Orphan. Please just go to bed. You'll feel better in the morning. You're just depressed, I promise. My father's face. You're scaring me. Just go to bed! Go to bed! John. Yeah. You all right? Yeah. You got the flu again? Did you need something? We found the guy. Pharmaceuticals. 6-foot-5. Local guy. Wolf tattoo. Exotic knife collection, weird shit. Guy thought he was Wolverine. They searched his back garden and found Helena Gaines. Remember her? Still looking for his costume. But they might not find it. Syringes are made out of silver. Half mile from the original crime scene. I'm gonna tell the press. My daughter could've solved this, and she's six. You threw that bottle at us. No, I didn't. Your daughter's about to lose all of her friends at school 'cause her father's not gonna be working in this county anymore. Somebody tell Gary he's fired. Do you wanna lay your seat back? Get some sleep? No, I'm fine. Carmen Gutierrez came by the house the other night and talked. It was terrible. I would've caught the guy. You would not have caught the guy, okay? You would've gotten killed. Gotta knock it off with this shit. You're making everybody miserable. We got him. You still win when the other guy knocks the eight-ball in. I'm right up here. I don't like you driving. You know it's my wedding anniversary today? I'm fine. I'm gonna do these returns. Happy New Year. Hey. Can you hang on just a second? Um... This is the job. And it sucks. Often. But you're gonna lose a lot more than that if you don't start focusing on the important stuff. You wanna be sheriff? How about we start acting like one? Hi, I'm John. I'm an alcoholic. Hi, John. This is gonna be tough. Hi, Mrs. Marten. I'm with the Sheriff's Department. I got some property of Hannah's that we took as evidence. I just need you to sign something - to say you got it back? - Okay. I started drinking again. Stress. Tough to be around. Hateful. I lied to my dad. Last thing I said to him. - Mr. Taxter. - Yeah. I'm coming from the Sheriff's Department. I have some evidence I have to return. Yeah, I know what those are. I was rude to Carla. And I had hateful thoughts toward Ricky and his whole family. When you're having a nervous breakdown, the only clue that you have that anything is terribly wrong with your life are the wonderful people around you who keep asking, "Is everything okay?" And you just go, "Yeah." When we were tracking the suspect... Killer. Or when we were putting together early evidence to find the suspect... - Killer. - Yeah. Okay. I'm working on it. Just give me a second on that one. Uh, I'm working on a lot here, Ricky. Miss Fairchild, hi. I'm with the Sheriff's Department. I have some property that we took as evidence from Liz... Fuck! This is Julia Robson. Hey, it's PJ Palfrey. You and another officer came by a while back and you guys forgot something here. I was just wondering if there's an address you guys wanted me to ship it to? Yeah, you can just ship it to the Snow Hollow Police Department. We can put it in storage. No, we're gonna keep the stuff. You guys just left this little sewing thing here that's not ours. - I'm sorry? - It looks old. It's like a seam ripper I guess? I'm not sure. My mom told me to call you guys about it. Hello? Mr. Carnury? Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Paul. I'm with the Sheriff's Department. I have some evidence we took a few months ago. I just need you to sign something saying you got it back. Uh, oh! Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me grab that, but, come in. Yeah, come on in. You want coffee? Uh, no, it's fine. I just need a signature. - How do you like it? - Oh. Sorry. You frightened me. I just need a signature. No, no, no. Come sit. Please. I wanna hear all about the case. I mean, you can talk about it now, isn't that right? Well, I mean, I hate to say there is not much to tell. The Tribune did a pretty good job with their write-up. The suspect or the killer had priors for battery. k but just some things slipped through the cracks. Doesn't happen often. Well, that's good to hear. Is there anything we could do to help the police? I mean, as townsfolk or something? No. Not much more than what you've done already. Thank you so much for letting us hold on to that evidence. Hope it wasn't an inconvenience. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's fine. Mind if I spill something in your coffee? I'd like that. Wife away for the weekend? Oh, I'm not married. Oh, I'm sorry. No, I was joking about the... - I'm sorry. - No, no. It's fine. But, uh... She couldn't hack it. I hear that. And your daughter? She's doing fine? Yeah, we got her going to, uh, college for scholarships. She's got gymnastics for school in January, and, um... I better shove off. I'm on the clock. But thank you so much for this, Mr. Carnury. Yeah. Yeah. You forget something? No, I'm sorry, Paul. Uh, something you said threw me. Stupid. So stupid. But I'm wondering if you wouldn't mind standing up to your full height for me. Yeah. Goddamn it! We got one. I'm at 244 Maple. I'm at 244 Maple. I got suspect on the move. Can I get backup, ASAP? Are you okay? You got laundry down the hall. I packed you some detergent. Did your mom text and say when she's getting here? She said she can't make it after all because of the traffic. Oh, that's a shame. You know, you didn't have to come here if you were busy. I wasn't busy. It was nothing. Actually pretty quiet at the station. You know, I thought it'd be a nice trip and got some stuff to do in town. And with everything else going on, I never get to... Whoa. Whoa. What's up? It's just a lot. Yeah. Well, I'm proud of you. - Mmm. - I'm proud of you. Oh! Yeah. Thanks. I had to cut a hole in the back. They don't make 'em for ponytails. Well, call us when you're settled, and I will help you out with that registration. You get everything figured out? Yeah, I'm working on it. Be safe. Hey. Hey. I love you. I love you. And speaking of safety... I left something in your top drawer. We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to. For protection. Disgusting! No! Stop! Stop! Just leave, please. Dad. God! I'll just... Let me call you later, okay? Jesus. Oh, my God. Dude, the whole gymnastics team just moved in down the hallway. Babes. All right. Fresh meat.
