Presents A co-production Funded by Distributed by Produced by An original idea by Ant?nio de Sousa Duarte and Jos? Francisco Gandarez Based on the book "Salgueiro Maia - A Man of Freedom" by Ant?nio de Sousa Duarte Gentlemen. Gentlemen... Fall in. As you all know, there are several types of State. There are the socialist, the so-called communist, the capitalist and the state we are in. Now, this solemn evening, I suggest we put an end to the state we are in. Whoever wants to, come with me to Lisbon and we will put an end to this. Voluntaries step outside and get information, those who don't want to, stay here. April 25th, 1974 1 AM SALGUEIRO MAIA THE IMPLICATED I want to speak with the President of the Council. Please come with me. I am showing our captain to the cabinet upstairs. Are they in yet? Find a pair of trousers for this gentleman and a clean shirt for Dr Ruy Patr?cio. And who are you? Captain Salgueiro Maia! I came to accept your surrender. Please get ready to leave the premises. Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Take care of the Ministers and I will speak with the President of the Council. I already know there is no Government. I expect to be treated with the dignity I always lived with. All arrangements have been made to prevent anyone from violating your physical integrity. No one will hurt you. How am I getting out of here? Through the front door. Do you think they will let me get out? People are not themselves. You will enter an armoured car together with your Ministers and you will be safe throughout. You will be taken to a place as yet unknown to me and you will remain under the Movement's custody. That Movement of the Armed Forces. What are their political ideals? It is not up to me to talk about it. Who is in it? About eight general officers, but to me that is the Oscar. And the colonies? I am sure we intend to avoid them turning into a new India. Professor, sir, I demand you surrender immediately. I understand. But I have already surrendered to General Sp?nola, five minutes ago. You know, I made it a point of transferring power to a general officer. I do not want power falling in the streets. You have an hour. Look, here comes Maia! Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. What? Did the bastard surrender? You may bring "Bula"... These bastards, man, they are something... - What? - Got a light? I don't smoke, thank you. Sorry, got a light? Thank you. Delfim. I am Maia. Nice to meet you. Estev?o, come here! This is Estev?o! - Well, then? - This is Maia. How is that doing? He comes from the Algarve. What about you? Pombal. But I was born in Castelo de Vide. I was born in Tr?s-os-Montes, but I live in Cascais. Will you let us in, or what?! You don't mind if I take this bed, do you? - No! No! Take your pick. - Thank you. Oh, man, Estev?o, let me get that one. You take that one. No problem. What do you young ladies think you are doing here? We are putting our stuff away, sir! You can't! Why can't we? Are we allowed to know? Look here, to begin with, at attention when to you talk to me! In case you don't know, let me explain. You young ladies are plebes and cannot settle in before cleaning the latrines. - I brought you the implements. - I'm not here to do any cleaning! So, what are you here for? I'm here to become a military officer! Very well. So, you may start by obeying superior's order. I think you are hazing the freshmen. - This is none of your business. - I don't care about any hazing. Want a piece of advice, kid? Learn to do how others do. It's the sheep that do that. I didn't come here to be a sheep. But you talk like a parrot. Very well. It is your choice. This son of a bitch! Do we put our stuff away? Do it! You gentlemen think this is hot, right? But believe me, next to the heat in Africa, this is nothing... One, two! Three, four! - Down, up! - Zero! - Down, up! - One! - Down, up! - Two! - Down, up! - Three! - Down, up! - Four! What? Now you are not speaking, you motherfucker. Come on, let's talk the three of us. Let's talk the three of us, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Shut up! Come on, let's have a little shower, you motherfucker! - A little shower, you vermin. - You son of a bitch! - A little shower, you vermin! Shh! - You son of a bitch! We've also got to wash your mouth, you son of a bitch. Let go of me, you cowards! These bastards can't do this shit to us. They beat you up, they beat Estev?o up, what the hell is this? - What do you want to do? - We should file a complaint! No, no one here is filing a complaint against anyone. Hazing should be about integration, not humiliation. - All right, and what is your solution? - Keep quiet. From now on, we walk with a buddy. We won't let ourselves be intimidated! The measure of a man is his attitudes, and this has to stop. Dude, all right, oh. What is it? I'm checking if anyone is coming this way. Come on, man! There is a party and we've not been invited? Oh the branches, oh the beautiful branches... Do you need another shower? No, what I want is for you guys to get lost. You are not touching us again! Let go of me! Maia, that attitude won't get you anywhere, you've got to learn to respect your superiors. Respect? I respect whoever is worthy of respect. And you guys lost all authority when you cowardly attacked my peers. Get lost, now! Carry on with your party. April 25th, 1974 10 AM I will speak with you, but you will have to come to me, sir. On behalf of the Movement of Armed Forces, I accept your immediate surrender, my Brigadier. Are you making fun of me, sir? The main points of the city are taken. Resistance is useless and dangerous. We don't want a blood bath. You should have thought of it first, before attempting this coup. Surrender, my Brigadier! And allow your men to come under my command! Sotto Maior, fire! Fire, it's an order! Fire, damnit! I am your superior; you owe me obedience! You have just lost your authority! You don't order a soldier to shoot another man wearing the same uniform. You have just ruined your life! Come on, fire! Fire, it's an order! Fire! Fire, they are the traitors! Fire, damnit! Take it easy! He is not going to fire! He is a Brigadier, but he is not a murderer! Gentlemen, you are now with the Movement of Armed Forces. We do not kill Portuguese officers. Is he here yet? Yes, yes! He's already seen us! He just looks so handsome. - ManÃªncia, you are taller. - Well, then? - Give us a hug, dude! - And the hair? Congratulations, eh? That was something! No, this was just the beginning! The adventure begins now. - You have lost weight. - Really? We thought you would give up. That's because you don't really know me. You there, where did you leave your horse, man? It stayed back there; it didn't fit in the bus! - You, there! - Are you coming to tea with us? - I can't, I told my dad I'd meet him. - So, we will come to tea with you. - Tomorrow, we'll push it for tomorrow! - Look, we'll do it tomorrow, man. - Tomorrow, see you tomorrow! - Alright, tomorrow! Go on, see you later. You saw that? He no longer walks, he marches. Look, we can't make fun of him, man. Are we going for tea or what? Let's go. Father. Hi. You are skinnier. It's the training. I passed all the classes. I'm starting junior year next month in Lisbon. And afterwards? Africa. Things are not well at all over there. They can't be, right, father? We get wind of a few things here, right? Some young men have already died from close by. I'm not going to die, father. I'm going to be an officer to defend my country. I'll cook you some stew so you can put some weight back on, you're just flesh and bones, my boy! Thank you, godmother. Good evening! Good evening! - Three beers, please. - Oh, that one is so hot! But it is true. Thank you! It is mine. Do you go to the Academy? - You bet! - Yes, yes! Would you like to join us? Yeah, sure I do. Let's go! What? Under one condition! Listen up, listen up. - Easy! - I've only got one condition! - All right, she's got it! - You don't make fun of us. Why would they make fun? They might just make fun of you! You look ridiculous in those uniforms. But it is o.k., we won't talk about it. Hit it! You can march! - March? - Up to our table. March! Go! Come here, come on. Your friends are all cheerful. They have drunk too much. What is your name? - Fernando. - Sara. Nice to meet you, Sara. Nice to meet you. You won't believe what I've got here. Those are not math notes, that's for sure. Notes, my foot, man. I've got the questions. - Where did you get that? - I've got my connections. What are you going to do with that? So, I write down the exam beforehand and all I have to do is swap it. That is unfair, especially to those who are studying. You don't need to study, Maia, the exam is right here, we can both use the same questions. Ok? You use it! I don't want that shit. My father wants to meet you. And why is that? I mention you so much when I go home, that he wants to meet the famous Maia. Dinner this Wednesday. I'm going to smoke a cigarette and leave you to being honest. Fuck. - Good evening, gentlemen! - Good evening, father! - Well, young man? - How are you? Welcome, Maia! Good evening, it's a pleasure to meet you Lieutenant Colonel. Around the house you can call me Almeida. My wife, Madalena. - Nice to meet you, Madam. - Good evening! Hello, mother! - Good evening, son! - Good evening! Shall we take a seat? You sit there. You sit down here next to me. Please. I hope you like consomm?. Excuse me? I didn't get it. The soup, young man. They are military men Madalena, there is no need for such niceties. I would like to thank you for... We don't speak at the table in this house! Efig?nia, you may serve. After dinner we will have the chance to talk. Isn't Madam Madalena joining us? No. This room is just for the men in the house. So, tell me, Maia. I already know you are a good student, but do you have it in you to be an army man? I do have it in me, yes sir! Do you hear this young man? Maia believes he is a military man. I believe it too, father. Delfim is a great student. Delfim has no discipline, he is undisciplined, and without discipline no one can be a military man. And where are you planning on going next, after you graduate? To the School of Cavalry, in Santar?m. Yes, sir! We need young men like you. Officers are needed in the colonies. That is what we are studying for. To defend Portugal overseas. Gr?ndola, sun-kissed town, land of fraternity. Rule the people within thee, oh city. Yes? I've been here since ten-thirty. Of course, I heard the code word. So, get out of here before you miss the operation. MOZAMBIQUE You are dismissed, private. Captain. At ease. Who are you? Second Lieutenant Salgueiro Maia. Welcome to the special forces ninth company of Montepuez, better known as the ghost company. You are dismissed. Why ghost, my Captain? The gentleman did not take the special forces course, did he? No, sir. You know the line here is a bit different from the shooting range back in Amadora, get it? I get it. I am here to stand up for my country. And you will. Everybody here does their share. You are dismissed! Maia, aren't you too relaxed for a rookie? - I'm ready! - Oh, are you? All right! But if there is any shooting you drop on the ground. And duck your head. You've got a big head. The blacks aren't really good shots, but they can well hit you. Pull back! There was two of them! They're down! It's over! Medic forward! Base, commander here. We've got one casualty. We request immediate evacuation. We were ambushed on the road to Lichinga. Fuck. Are you o.k.? Yes. I'm o.k. It is always worse the first time. No one warned us it would be this way back at the Academy. What? No one warned us it would be this way. Fuck, if they did, the dudes would not come over. I would, anyways. You, what? I would, anyways. Right, either you are very brave, or you are completely nuts. Hey, Maia! Listen up. The watchword around here is to kill, or get killed, do you hear me? You, when a guy goes in the bush, there is no science, no strategy. They hide, they ambush. Sometimes it is us. You shoot at whatever moves, do you hear? Do you hear? And, fuck, you look out for the mines! You step on a mine, it cuts off your legs, you are done for, for the rest of your life. Do you hear me? Take this shit, have a smoke, it does you better. Take it, take it, take it. - Is it clear, here? - Yep! The food here is pretty shitty. Don't worry, after the second you'll no longer... I was starving. I ate plenty. Me too. I ate like a king. - I ate too much. - Eat a peanut, here. I've had my fill. There's only room for the beer, here, a toast. To your daughters! Got any more cigarettes? Got any more cigarettes? Look at that motherfucker! You must be kidding, you must be kidding, you motherfucker. I can't stop eating this shit. Do you think you come here to be heroes? Hear me out. There aren't any heroes here! Here we fight as a team! We're all one! Will you excuse me? Am?rico, you've got a letter. Batista. Is there anything for me? Here, Captain. Thank you. This one has arrived for you. - For me? - Yes. You should get yourself a female pen-pal, too. You would get letters every day and remember the good life. Oh... I'll open this one later. I'll also make a toast to you. Don't drink it all up. Well? Maia? Bad news? I friend of mine died in Angola. Let me through. You don't need to pretend you are not crying, Maia. Would you like beer or wine and soda? Beer. You mustn't leave your cigarettes on the table just like that, or they will smoke them all for you. Cry to your heart's content. Can I have a look? Nice picture. Have you lost someone, too? Between paratroopers and marines, I think I've lost all my childhood friends. No, two are still around. Two from my hometown, they went to study in Coimbra. Smart. That's the way. How can you cope? Every day I go in the bush thinking my fucking time is not up yet. Do you hear me? I fight for my life. That's what I do. Or do you think it's those dudes sitting in a cabinet back in Lisbon who know what's going on here? They know nothing! I fight for you and you fight for me. Do you hear me? We fight for dear fucking life! April 25th, 1974 6:30 AM Who are you? We came to hold you up, my Captain! Why didn't you? Don't you remember me? Cut off the crap. Who are you? I apologize, I'm Gameiro, you were my instructor in Santar?m. The minute the boys heard that Captain Maia was leading the insurgents, we decided to join you! - Captain! - Captain! - Very well. Cover the waterfront and watch the navy's movements on the Tagus. Captain, what are your intentions? To overthrow the government and put an end to the war in Africa that is slowly killing us. We are the Movement of Armed Forces. Let's go. You look different, man! And you, have you looked at yourself in the mirror? We are alive, aren't we? I saw his family. You've got more guts than me. They are heart-broken. The dude died the very first day, coming out of the bush. A mine. A bounding one. He was shattered to pieces. Damnit, man! We are going to miss him, that fucker Estev?o. - Good afternoon! - Good afternoon! - Where do you want to sit? - I don't know. You pick. - Excuse me. - I'm sorry. Thank you. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - What do you want to eat? - Dude, I want to eat. - Call the Mister. - Breaded mackerels? Yes. Hey, Mr. J?lio! Just a second. Is there anything you'd like? Can I offer you a soda? No, thank you. Hey, Mr. J?lio! Hell, just a second. And can I offer you a Martini? You look like you need one. Hi! See you tomorrow! See you tomorrow? Weren't we going home? I don't think I told you where I work, did I? We have a very efficient intelligence service in the army. Who did you speak with? With the gentleman at the caf? where you usually have lunch. He told you knock off at this time. And you decided to try your luck? It did not go wrong. That's what you think. Maybe if you had... If you had given me your number, we could have arranged... Right, that's why I didn't. Come on, I'll treat you to lunch. You look like you enjoy pork steak. Are you calling me fat? No, no, no. No, by no means. But I think you must be hungry by now. I am, a little. You've got to speak up, this darn phone must be from the time of the Peninsular war. Oh, I reckon there were no phones back then. I can really tell you're a teacher. And can we get together today? What? Can we get together today? What time? Later? No, today I can't, I've got to grade my student's tests. Tomorrow? We'll see about that. Want to take me out to dinner? You are a tough cookie! I sure am! All right, I'll take you out to dinner. See you tomorrow? A kiss. What? Good night. Good night. Breathe, Fernando. No, it is good. You may not have gotten malaria, but you were pierced by Cupid in Santar?m, right? Cut off the crap. Watch out, Fernando, if the rookies hear you talking sweet over the phone, they won't obey you when you are instructing them, Fernando. - Will you knock it off? - Watch out, Fernando. You are under her spell, Fernando. Do you have to go back to the barracks? Not today. That is good. Oh, is it good? - And why is that? - Nothing. I'd like to show you my place. Isn't it early? No, it's late. I've got classes tomorrow. What's the matter? Why that face? There's something I've got to tell you. What? What did I do? I did something wrong, is that it? No, no! No? So, what is the matter, Fernando, here we are making love and you... what? It's nothing of the sort. I am not very good with women, nor very experienced. No one could tell. Nor am I too good at this kind of romantic stuff. But my life has changed ever since I met you. I am no longer the same man and I want it to be this way forever. Are you asking me to marry you, Fernando Jos? Salgueiro Maia? Don't start rolling yet, let's get a picture first. Hey, Delfim, get it over with, I'm late for my honeymoon. Hang on, hang on. Come on, smile for the camera. Gorgeous! - One more! Get one more! - One more? Oh, Maia, you have a very narcissistic wife! Nat?rcia, you take good care of this young man, o.k.? Right, see you later. Bye! GUINEA Captain! I think I've stepped on a mine, Captain. No one move! Captain! Easy Ramiro, easy. Easy, we are getting you out of here, do you hear me? We'll sort this out. Delfim, come on! Easy, take a deep breath. Don't move, o.k.? Remember your wife. Easy, Ramiro. Take it easy, Ramiro. - What is the name of your wife? - Margarida. There, you are going to think about Margarida and how you are going to kiss her when you get home. Margarida... Take it easy, don't move your foot, Ramiro, don't move your foot. - Keep still, do you hear? - Easy. Ramiro, breathe. Breathe. Breathe, be a man. You've got a rent in your pants, if a snake sneaks in it will chew off your nuts. Well, then, Delfim? Easy, take it easy. Easy, easy. Breathe. Ramiro, easy. - Easy. Easy. - Do you know that song? - Do you know that song or not? - No. - Fuck, no! - About your wife. - Breathe. - You are pissing in your pants. No. No, I don't know. You are pissing in your pants. Magali, Magali. Come on, easy. It's an anti-vehicle. It's an anti-vehicle. There, there, Ramiro. It's an anti-vehicle, you're going to take off your foot very slowly, do you hear? - Slowly. - Come on, slow. Slow. Easy. - Medic! - Medic. Medic! Maia, where do I throw this? There is a slope over there, go lay it there. Slowly, slowly. Delfim! Enemy at three o'clock! Delfim! - Oh, fuck! - Delfim! Are you o.k.? What is this? It just brushed by me. Fuck, my weapon, hell, sons of a bitch. Our Father, which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. What are you staring at? At you, Captain. Who were you talking to? To God. I didn't take you for a religious man. We are deep in shit and mud up to our necks, with mosquitoes and blacks hidden in the bush, ready to wipe us out. Don't you think we can use a little extra help, just in case? Sure, sure we can. I pray for you and the others. Excuse me? I pray for all of us. So that tomorrow when we get back to base, we are many as we are here today. Now, go get yourself some sleep, while you can. April 25th, 1974 4 PM They need to withdraw! They need to go on other missions! It is necessary that they evacuate this square! Journalist, captain. Captain, captain, what is the state of affairs? The state of affairs. Answer, captain. Captain, what is the state of affairs? The state of affairs. Right now, we've got it under control. We have the air force on our side, we have the 7 Cavalry armoured cars, the weapons with us. And the people, my captain. That's it, blessed boy, we have the people on our side. Who can assure me that we won't get shot once we've passed that gate? I assure you. The Movement does not shoot anyone, unlike the Political Police did. Any deaths? Three civilians died on Ant?nio Maria Cardoso Street. I'm going for the armoured car. Here. They will kill us! No one will kill anyone here. Great victory yesterday! And you got Marcelo out in one piece! We had trouble with the PIDE. They're the ones who are going to have trouble with us. We made history yesterday. We did our job. What are you going to do now? Now, I'm going back to Santar?m. I've done my bit. I accomplished my mission. Our country needs men like you. We have a future to build. No. I'm a soldier. I'm not a politician. You know where to find me if you need me. Now you've caused the revolution, you can't run away from it. We're all heroes. Gentlemen, there has been an uprising of paratroopers in Lisbon. March 11th, 1975 12 PM General Sp?nola decided to take power and put the country in order. They request that 7th Cavalry step in. Excuse me, Commander, but I totally disagree with it. Yes, but Sp?nola ordered to move forward. Besides, Sp?nola is not mandated by the Movement to give us orders. - This is mutiny. - Maia. Is this what we did the April revolution for? I'm not leaving. I won't be leaving. What about you? Are you with Maia? But look, dude, do you confirm there's an uprising? It's Sp?nola's men, dude. The air force opened fire on the Artillery Regiment parade. They killed one of ours. And are they moving forward? This is still uncontrollable, man. If you move forward it'll be war. Otelo has confirmed the uprising, they attacked the Artillery Regiment 1. He says if we move forward it will be war and he is right. With our fire power, no matter what side we take, things will turn for the worse. - And now what? Now we talk to the other commanders and we pass the information over to the Operative Command. For now, we stay in the barracks, if things start to get worse, we'll have to make a decision. Sp?nola sent helicopters and aircraft flying over the Artillery Regiment. That's crazy. The dude wants to overthrow the Junta. Captain, we are here to confirm that 7th Cavalry left for Lisbon. Did you need to come by helicopter? We must be really important. 7th Cavalry is important to our movement. And what movement is that? It doesn't look like the Movement of Armed Forces to me. - Have you left, or haven't you? - No, we haven't. You will have to come with us to the Tancos base. - I will? - If you please. And what am I going to do in Tancos? Speak with General Sp?nola. Why didn't the Cavalry School head towards Lisbon? You must be kidding me. To me all of this looks like a Western. What do you want? A civil war, is it? Do you want to destroy the country after all we've been through to rid it from fascism? And what do you plan to do with all these idiots surrounding you? Take two steps back! How old are you? I asked you a question, how old are you? Twenty. You've never been in the colonies, have you? - No, sir. - So, don't you try to intimidate me, because I've already broken the teeth of many dudes like you. This has to be stopped now, before it's too late. Are you going to arrest me? Shoot me? The Movement does not shoot anyone. Fernando... Oh, Fernando, so? I was worried about you, huh? I called the barracks, no one picked up. - Are you o.k., are you o.k.? - Yes. Things almost reached a breaking point. Yes, I saw it, on TV. Sp?nola tried to seize power. Was he arrested? No. He fled to Spain on a helicopter. But they said it on the news that you had been to Tancos. Yes, I had to go speak with him. Were you on the side of the mutineers, Fernando? - Answer me! - Of course not. A man was killed, right? A poor devil who was in the dormitory. The shots pierced through the roof. Fernando, every time I hear there were shootings, I immediately think it was you. It was an attempted coup. A few cowboys trying to make some noise, that's all. I don't know, Fernando. People are divided. There are many rumours. The People are serene. What's this? Fernando, what is this? What's happening? What's happening, Fernando? No, Fernando, don't go. What happened to you? What is this? I don't know, I cut myself, it doesn't matter. Who are these people? They are with the Radical Military. They know you went to speak with Sp?nola, they must think you are on the side of... What is this? Fernando. You bastards, this shit is over now! Get out of here! 25th November, 1975 What is it, Fernando? Hello? I'm on my way over. Affirmative, we are loyal to the chain of command, my General. Fernando, what happened? Yes, I will stay and wait. Well then? What's with the long face? Fernando? Is there a war about to start? It may have well started. The paratroopers have risen up. I have got to go. We now have in our studios for the TV news the Captain who is going to tell us exactly what is happening with the Portuguese Radio Television. Right, unfortunately at the moment the Portuguese Radio Television is not being heard across the whole country... These dudes have the air bases all under control. And they hold the National Television in their grip. I think Porto and Lous? are broadcasting for the Porto studios, so there is a cut.. Do you know what this Clemente said when he took Lumiar? "Don't come over..." How did it go? These bastards... "Because this is full of rocket launchers "and if it crosses the mind of some military man to shoot, the armoured car will be blown to dust." - That only means they are afraid. - Hell, they are. And that they do not have this under control. - In the April Revolution... - We have to go, Maia! - Where do you want to go? - To Lisbon! We have to sort out this mess. Do you remember the 11th of March? It is the same. The men are all nervous, Maia, they are watching the exact same piece of news we are watching here. Right fellows? Huh? Don't I get an answer, damnit? No one does anything until we get our orders to move forward. - What's up? Do we go? - No. We wait. Two hundred men from the Amadora Special Troops and sixteen armoured cars operating under the Chief of Staff surrounded the regiment of the Ajuda Military Police on the side of the uprisers. There was an exchange of fire. The deaths are to be mourned of two officers with the special forces and of one with the uprisers. Maia, here. Ah, Nat?rcia, it is you. Yes, I also heard it on the radio. Everything remains the same, we await our orders. Yes, yes, I love you too, but now I've got to hang up, o.k.? So, what did he say? Still no orders. Do you think they will advance on Lisbon? The military are shooting at one another. Ridiculous. They survived the colonies to kill each other now? No matter how reluctant he is, Fernando will have to pick a side. Maia, here. My General. Affirmative. The men are on the alert. Affirmative. Thank you. I think we should go out. - Do we have our orders? - Get the men together, we are leaving to Lisbon. - How many? All of us. And on whose side are we, Maia? I can only side with Democracy and the Rule of Law, what about you? We leave in an hour. Everyone surrendered without resistance following an attack without bullets on the barracks by MAF troops led by Salgueiro Maia. The operation unfolded without a single shot to the happiness of the civilians on the premises. Come on, turn that off. Huh? One more bloodless victory. First the 25th of April and now the 25th of November. I feel I've only made enemies ever since it all started. I'm your friend, you bastard. Better quality over quantity, right? Hell, man, no one understands it. - Forget about it, look... - Fuck. This morning we didn't know if we would make it to Christmas. They told him? To go to Paris? They were afraid someone might want to kill him. How absurd. Well, but Fernando was caught in the crossfire. It is the worse spot to be in a revolution. He left with the men. And that's why the communists think he is a traitor. And Eanes believes he should have left earlier. Like Jaime Neves, with his gun blazing. Well, can we have a look at that codfish? Knock it off! Cheeky you. - Would you like one? - Yes, I would. Check. Fill it all up. There. I know you don't like Christmas, but you could put a different face, man. Everything is quiet. Do you think so? So, revolutions are over. What joy... What is it? I've been invited to sit on the Council of the Revolution. Oh, man, sure, and what then? And I refused, of course. You did what? You must be kidding me. I refused. They knew I would refuse and that's why they invited me. - But you don't know that. - I do, I do. - Oh, man. Oh, Maia. - I do, I am a nuisance to them. I am a nuisance because I'm not running around yelling watchwords, nor do I engage in petty politics. And mostly because I'm not quick to pull the trigger. That is why I screwed them. Captain Maia is here. - Let him in. - For sure. What do you need, Fernando? I need you to tell me what the hell this is all about, Vasco. I've just been appointed to go to the Azores. - I already knew about that shit. - Are you making fun of me? - Easy, Maia. - Easy what, man? What do you guys want to screw me for? Let's see. Is it the 11th of March? Is it the 25th of November, is it my not taking sides, what is it? - There's more to it than it seems. - But you admit it is to nail me. I admit that what they are doing is disloyal as hell. Right! It is disloyal as hell. And what are you going to do, Vasco? You will nullify it, right? I have already spoken to the people I needed to speak to. I have already done all I could. And what, then? And there is nothing that can be done, for sure. After having been seconded twice to Africa, after having been at the front line of this shitty revolution, - I am implicated in all this. - This is coming from the top. - You know there are people... - To hell with them. There are people who do not like your behaviour. You want to pull me away from my wife and send me off to rot in the Azores. - Are you going down that road? - I am! You give up on your mission and I toss my General stars on to the table. - The stars? - Then we'll see what happens. I've never done this for anyone, but I'll do it for you. But people remain the same. I don't want your stars. I won't hold you slave to my problems. Fernando, you know there is an old Moslem proverb that says: "It is better to be a master of your silence, than a slave of your words." That is very beautiful, huh? Look, the way it goes among us is: "Watch what you say". I'm fed up with this shit, Vasco. Fernando. Fernando! Good evening, gentlemen. I was told so, but I couldn't believe it. Look who's here! The great April Revolution hero is here to take a breath of the Island's air. - So, you've also been exiled, man? - Yeah, man, so it seems. - Where are the orders, tell me? - Back there. And you also screwed yourself big time and ended up here. It goes to show how much the folks in Lisbon care about me. Care about you or are afraid of you? Afraid my foot, I wouldn't hurt a fly. But the flies did get you good, huh? What are you doing here man? It seems that flies don't really fancy me. Look here, who told you to play the revolutionary? You're so funny. And how are the men? They are cool. They are good people. Any incident? There are some smart guys around, waving flags of the Azores Liberation Front. Really? The ALF. - Got a cigarette? - I do, man, right here. You know, I like their flag, man. It is like the flag of Belenenses football club... But look, don't worry, I believe I know what to do with those flags. What? I will blow them up. Good afternoon. Can I have a small coffee, please? Thank you. Thank you. You don't have many friends on this island. I don't have many friends. Why is that I wonder? Because people don't like it when you stand up to them. It depends on the people... I rub many people the wrong way. That is why I came here. But it seems I also rub many people the wrong way around here. Not everyone... I wonder if it's got poison. Spit it out. What do you want me to say? What you've got stuck in there for days. Things have not been easy lately. No, they haven't. But together we can overcome whatever comes our way, can't we? Yes, so what? Well, I think it's about time we had a baby. We've been trying, but... it hasn't worked out. Yes, and the way we've been doing it, it won't work either. Well and how else are we going to make it work? I spoke with a friend of mine who works for Social Security and I signed us up for adoption. I must have done something really serious to shut Salgueiro Maia up. Come here. I know I should have spoken with you first. I really, really want to have a baby with you. It will always be our baby. Do you? In this case it is not a baby, it is a little girl. Girl? A little girl? A little girl. Fernando, Assis Pacheco is here. How are you? Much better now. It is a pleasure to meet you. The pleasure is all mine. You know I enjoy your books very much. Well, coming from a hero, that is... No, wrong start. Not this way. Well, I am no hero, I am a military man, that's all. Ok, so be it. First off, I wish to thank you for the chance of granting me this interview. Nat?rcia and I believe you are the only one capable of telling my story the way it should. - Let's see if I can do it. For sure. - Can we start? - Yes, we can. But before we begin, I'd like to give you a scoop. - That's what you call it, right? - Right. - No, but... you can record it. - Very well. I applied for a government pension for exceptional or relevant services. It seems fair to me. If there is anyone who's been entitled to apply for it over the past decade, it's you, sir. - We'll see. - Well, what do you wish to ask me? - Very well. So... When you think everything has already been done to you... You should challenge that shit. It's unfair, man, after all you've done for this country. - But it's the country we've got. - Anyone care for some ice cream? Members of the former political police get pensions, and I am denied one. You upset a lot of people. Look, I'm going to get an ice cream, anyone want some? No one wants it, I do. And you, won't you say anything? You've never needed them, Fernando. Don't let petty politics upset you. They'll never be able to erase what you've done for this country. Let's go drink some coffee. Wait. Let's go. Finally! Are you mad at me? No. You are April Revolution, Captain Salgueiro Maia. You have got a wife and a beautiful daughter. That's all that should matter to you, nothing else. The bastards really got to me. You skin has gotten thinner, Fernando, that's all. How beautiful, congratulations. - He is beautiful! - He is pretty, man! Fine boy, huh, Maia. Have you seen him, Catarina, your brother? Congratulations to the three of you. Congratulations to all of you. The four of you. You are wonderful people. He is beautiful, he is beautiful. And why is that? It takes guts, right? To adopt two children. No C?tia, we are just two very lucky people for having two really beautiful children. This is mother, son. Welcome to this world, Filipe, there may be some bad company out there, but your family and friends will always be here to stand up for you. Let's go to mother, let's go. Promotions are coming up, Fernando. They are. Who would say, huh? I'd rather they wouldn't be coming up. Are you still pissed at the country? You think I shouldn't? Resentment won't get you anywhere, Fernando. Fuck resentment! After all we've been through, all the pain, is this it? But we have got family, we got good health, we've got friends, we've got everything. We've already been through a lot, Fernando. I'd like to be like you, you know. Be able to forgive. But I can't. What's that? Is it the burden of pain, or what? Fernando? Fernando? Fernando, what is it? Fernando, easy, easy. Fernando. Fernando. Easy, Fernando. Squat down a little. Easy, take it easy. Easy on yourself. Easy there. Come on, sit there. Take it easy. Darn it, you are pale, man. What happened? Come on, let's go. - Let's go. - It was nothing, it was... Come on, Fernando. I just felt queasy. And besides these queasy spells is there anything else that isn't the way it should? With me or the country? With you, Captain. Future Lieutenant Colonel. My apologies. Forget about it, doctor. Give me an example of what might not be right with me. Lack of appetite, weight loss, blood in your stool, diarrhoea. Any of these? All of the above, doctor. You never told me that, Fernando. I am telling now. Do you smoke? Since I was fourteen. - Do you drink? - He does, every day! Regularly, yes. Your diet, is it varied? I enjoy eating well. Red meat, sausages, fats. Affirmative. I keep on telling him to eat lettuce, but he says lettuce is for rabbits. - And isn't it, doctor? - Yeah. You make fun of it. What is wrong with me? Considering what we just mentioned, we'll start with a strict diet. And... and we'll have to run more tests. We need more elements for a diagnose. You may open it. Close it again. I think I found it. Do I have something that I shouldn't? No, I'm sorry. You are Salgueiro Maia, right sir? I am. Thank you very much! Whatever for? For having made it possible for my generation to live in a democracy. How old are you? I'm twenty-two. Can you hold this, please? Thank you. I was little when the April Revolution took place, but I saw the footage on television. And my father kept saying that thanks to you, sir, our country did not go into civil war. Give your father a hug. He's no longer with us. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry, he was very sick, and it was better this way. Open it up. You can't change the result, right? Why postpone it? Where are the glasses? Where is my glass? Easy, Catarina. Slowly. Nat?rcia, watch the kids. Come on, let's toast. What, Fernando? Leave them be, it's only normal. The tree won't make it to the new year. Well, but they are children, it is only normal, right? It's normal but they are making me nervous. - Come on, let's make the toast. - Come on! Slowly. Maia, you wanted children, right? Now you have to put up with them. Yes, but they could run around less, right? Especially at this time of day. It will be midnight pretty soon. Do you want to celebrate midnight earlier for the kids? That is a good idea and that way we celebrate new year in peace, right? - It is better for the children, yes. - So, Maia, how is that doing? - Good. - Did you go to the doctor? I did. Look, it really sucks, it seems I've got cancer, after all. - Well, then? - I'll be operated next year. - Oh, that really sucks. I'm so sorry. - Hopefully it'll be nothing. Hopefully, it'll be nothing and I mean, sometimes people get these things wrong. - I don't know. - Are you a doctor? Look, I wouldn't mind being one at all. - So, you don't know either, right? - I don't, it's true. - No one knows, we don't know. - Well, exactly. But that... Well, that is good too, right, we can drop this topic and focus on the toast. - Let's do it! - Let's! And celebrate one more year that we didn't fight. That's it. - Happy new year, everyone! - Happy new year! Happy new year, everyone... In the eye, huh? Otherwise... Mother. Mother. - Come on, Fernando. - Wait. Easy. Everything is o.k. I'm here. It's over. Easy. Everything is o.k. Everything is o.k., easy. Is everything O.k.? Everything is O.k. Everything is o.k., easy. What are you doing here? I came to see you. Don't worry, Nat?rcia, don't worry. I came to see how you are doing, man. How are you, Fernando? Hey, big head, I'm going over there to take a puff with your wife. How is he? It's still early to say. And what does the doctor say? Thank you for coming over. Not at all. Goodbye Captain. January 1992 But you can still see the bullet holes. That is dove shit, man. Fuck. Fernando, you have a way of making it impossible to dream, man. But didn't you dream back then, man? - And it was worth it, right? - And it was worth it. I'm finished, man. You're not, man. You are going to London. You are going to cure that shit. Fuck, Fernando. You are the only dude that I know who rose up again even stronger every time he fell. Not this time. I walked in there all by myself. I was trembling like a leaf, my heart seemed like a wild horse. Don't ask me why, but back then I knew that I would win. Now I'm going again on my own, only this time I won't be winning. When I die, I don't want any whining, any tributes, no half-masts, no fucking nothing. Nor do I want you to worry about the place where to bury my body. I want to you to worry about those who want to bury what I helped build. Fernando Jos? Salgueiro Maia did not win his last battle and died in Lisbon, at the Boa-Hora Military Hospital on April 3, 1992 after three operations and a stay at a London hospital that proved unsuccessful. That day, Vasco LourenÃ§o, who was visiting Jerusalem, leans his hands and his head on the Wailing Wall and says a prayer for Salgueiro Maia. On April 25, 2016, Salgueiro Maia was posthumously decorated by the President of the Republic Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa with the Grand Cross of the Order of Henry the Navigator.
