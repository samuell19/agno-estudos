Miggy Montenegro. I'm here... What? You're early! The plane was a little too excited to arrive. And didn't you miss me? Of course I did! I'm almost there! Aha! I see you already! What's taking you so long? I don't see you yet! I see you! - Sister! I missed you! - Sister! You're so mean! That's why I don't understand why you got back together with me. Me? I'm a hopeless case, Belle. Give my regards to your Aunt Che. Father. Bebe ko. Remember to be a good boy while I'm in Canada, OK? - OK, let's go. - OK. By, sis. - Bye, my child. - Sis. Come here. - Why? Are you going to make me stay? - Come here. Looks like you need a... power hug! Babe, I'll miss you. - Laida! Where's the cover photo? - Oh, yes, sir. - Laida! - Yes? Oh! Wait! Mom? Tell your aunt I'll stay there for a while. Mom, don't leave. Why? What's happening? Your father and I are separating! Mom, no. Why? I knew this would happen! Even at his age, Tomas still managed to be unfaithful! Stay here! Don't bother going back home! We'll process the children's papers and get them from Tomas! Mom. Bebe ko. Bebe ko. - Stop crying! - Bebe ko. - It won't do you any good! - Bebe ko. - I don't understand you anymore. - Bebe ko. - That will lead nowhere. - Be? - Laida... - My dad... The ICU is ready. What happened? Huh? The crash cart is here, Doc. Babe, I'm sorry... I can't be with you right now. I'm really sorry... Miggy. Mom, I won't be gone for long. Miggy just needs me right now. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm sorry. Mom... Laida! Laida! Wait! I thought you were different. - Sister, check out the hunk! - You're so noisy. - Where? - There! Bah! Sir Miggy is still more handsome than him, right sister? Stop that. Have more chocolates. Here. That guy's still more handsome than your idol Miggy! What goes around comes around, huh? They say his family is richer than the Montenegros! Talk about karma. Miggy is still better. - Right, sis? - No, right? Enough of that, Leo. Your sister is tired. But, sister, I'm curious. If you see him again, what's the first thing you will do? - Slap him. - Ignore him. Really now? I know what she'll really do! What? You will still love him. You'll still have your happy ending. - Let me tell you something. - What is it? Remember this. Not everyone gets a happy ending in real life. OK? Don't forget that! - Seriously? - Yes. - Just like that? - Yes, just like that. Oh, it's over. Can I go now, Art? It's not that easy. Why? I mean we have you, Art, Alice, Anya and I. They no longer trust you. Sister. We've lost the airline already. This is the only chance we've got. We're gonna lose the company. Art would like to remind you of your meeting with Ms. Laida Magtalas, 9:30 a.m. at Flippage. Thank you. She's awake, Mom! Wide awake! Are you really sure about this, Laida? You can still back out. I heard he screwed up again. That's why he was sent back here. Why couldn't they just put him in their laundry business in Laguna? Because that will probably be the first to close down. - Please bring this to Art's office. - Yes, sir. Does she know? Know what? If Miggy is over there, who's over here? I heard it's for the new consultant. I guess his siblings don't trust him with the way he manages their wealth so they gave him a consultant. If he still screws up with that... Who is that new consultant, anyway? - According to HR, her name is Laida. - Laida? Laida Magtalas? The ex-girlfriend of Miggy, who is now with Ms. Belle? You're too much. Come on, brother, I'm just going to my office. I sure I won't mess that up. Wow! I missed you, guys! Sir, Ms. Magtalas is already coming up. OK. He's looking here? It looks like he's gonna use us as human shields. This isn't good. Why so formal? It's not like we don't have a shared history. Miggy, why don't you introduce our editors? Of course, brother. Who would've thought? And of course, you know them already. Can anyone tell me what those numbers represent? I didn't know I was worth that much to you, Mr. Montenegro. If only that really was my salary. So much to learn and so much to reach. Not everyone's given the chance to get in. That will be opened for Flippage if we are able to get MET What was your position there? Just one letter away from EA. It's just a different title. How sure are you that we don't have them? Then I wouldn't be here. That's what I want to know. I was asked to come back. Go on, Mr. Montenegro! I'm interested to hear what you have to say! I don't want to force myself in where I'm not needed. But we can't work together. Personal matters will just always get in the way. Laida. Laida, what do you want? You don't want to work with me anymore, right? Well? Laida, what do you want? Come back. Let's talk about this. Talk about what? Do you really want me back? First, tell me that you need me. "I can't make it without you, Laida." OK! No problem! Laida! Wait! Wait! All right! OK! I'll say it! Laida, please. Come back! I can't be without you! OK? Is that good enough? - OK? - OK. Over here, Ma'am. Is this how you welcome an old friend? Are you really Laida? Prove it. Get us coffee. Don't boss her around. She bosses us around now. What show were you putting on there? What? What a fake. The Laida I used to know didn't talk like that. Snooty Laida. Snooty Laida versus The Montenegro Devil. Team Red or Team White? With or without... Go ahead and laugh. This is all professional. So the sooner we finish this, the better! You're out of your mind. But you know what? You're blooming. Your hair and your clothes look great. Are you in love? Who's the new guy? Just because I'm blooming, I'm in love? More like... I was in love once, was hopeful once. Got hurt. And now I'm blooming because I've moved on! - Nice. - Cool! How old were you when you fell in love with Miggy? And how long has it been since the break-up? Two years, I guess. And you've really moved on, huh? Without a doubt! I'm so OK. Definitely OK! I love being single! Things are going to get interesting. Being single is awesome. Hear that? They'll have lunch outside. Jealousy? More fun in the Philippines. Sure you're not jealous. Is this for real? Why would there be? I don't know. Belle, Laida and I are over. I'm sorry. Please, forgive me. Please. You're wrinkling my clothes. Brother. Yes, brother. It's not easy to reschedule a meeting with them. Hello? How? We are the ones courting them. We want to hear them say... "Yes! We are giving you the exclusive rights to publish MET in the Philippines." So what do we need to do to get their sweet "yes"? You mean, you buy the "yes" of the one you're courting? I don't remember getting paid by you before. Was I the one who did the courting? To get their "yes", How do we do that? First, we have to show them I need financial reports of Flippage and the whole Montenegro Corporation to prove that we can afford their 10,000 dollars monthly license fee and we have the financial capacity to produce the issue. We have to show Empire - No! - What? But let me talk to her, so that you can use your brain cells for other things. What a way to keep him from her. OK, thank you. Maning, how are the maintenance people doing? It's hot in here! Yeah. It's really hot. Not cool! Since we are asking for their brand, I need your authorization so we can start processing our budget and bookings. You can't let an opportunity like this pass. We only have two weeks left to finish all the work. Can't you give us something sweet? There. Is that sweet enough? No substance. All fluff. The nerve. Guys, let's play hide and seek... of feelings. - I'll count... - OK. - OK. - This must be him! You want to eat elsewhere? These look pretty much the same. Your picks for the models are all wrong. There's no feeling in the eyes. The eyes alone should speak to you... In one look, they'll surely give a yes... just like Miggy's! And John Ray's... And Vincent's... There! Let me see! There. Work on that. Let's work on that. I'm sorry. I thought your eyes were calling us. Just kidding! Sir, is there something you need? OK. Sure. Why did you close it? I said, "close the door" when you leave. I'll just close it instead. That's it. That's all I can give you. Sounds pretentious. Like we're conceited. So you don't like it? I'm not saying that I don't like it. I'm just saying what I think. Exactly! So you don't think it's OK? Fine! It's not! - There! You finally said it! - That's what I've been saying! - So do you want to replace that? - Yes! - We don't have time! - Well then, let's find time! Do we stick to this power issue? Or are we going to come up with something better? This is your idea, right, Andy? No, Andy. Look. I just want to sleep! Do you know how long I've been awake? My body is now swimming in coffee, soda, and nicotine! I just want to rest! I just want to sleep! I just want to have sex with my boyfriend! The two of you are confusing me! If you have issues with each other, please, keep me out of it! I am not going to take sides, because I want nothing to do with your drama! I don't care anymore. I quit! I resign! I will now sleep! Goodbye! What happens now? Who's going to be our editor-in-chief? - Me! - Me! - OK. There you go. - Finally. Yup. We need something scrumptious to make up for all our stress. - Let me have some, then. - No! Because you and Miggy have been causing all this stress! - Right. - So you and Miggy are not allowed here for now. Us? Your stress? That's how you guys are! Constantly going against each other! Even we get caught up in your unfinished business! We get affected by your issues too. - I can't believe it. - Before, we had a Laida who... tamed the Montenegro Devil when he got pissed. When the team would get tired, there was a Laida who would tell us that we could do it. Before, there was someone who would remind us to believe in goodness. Before... Enough! You guys are overreacting! Before! That was before. Things are different now. OK? What's the difference? What? Before... Sir, how close? After... Pretty. - Thank you. - You're silly, sir. That's it. That's the theme we want for our issue. We want to show how meaningful metamorphosis is... Change... the entire process of it. Yeah, but if we do this, But we have less than a week before we leave for New York. Where can we find a person who went through that? - Me? Why me? - Yes. Why not? Wasn't this your idea? The cover can go: We can do a feature ala New York Diaries. - Exactly. - No, guys. I won't to do it. - Who says "yes"? - Me. - Me. - Me too. Wait! Are you the only editor here? How about Miggy? Sir? Sir, if you want us to get MET... - For MET, I say yes. - Yes! - Yes. - You're outnumbered. let's start this shoot immediately! Zoyla and friends win again! - Here's our peg for... - Bro, how to do this? - Good day. - But... Miggy! I missed you, Miggy! - Good day. - You're still handsome! Good morning. Leo, help me. - Let me help you, Mom. - Get that. Zoyla is helping Laida get dressed. Today, we will shoot the before part... Here she is! It's all digital, so we can... Does she look OK? - It's the only thing left that fits. - There you go! Say hello to our old friend, Laida version 1.0! This is the Laida we missed! - Let's give her a group power hug! - Yeah! - We missed your hair. - You look beautiful. Together with the Christmas decor. Wait. Just a moment. - Something is missing. - I agree. Is it the clothes? - This was it. - How about the hair? - No. This was her hair, too! - So what's missing? It's her smile. That Laida smile... that reaches up to her eyes. That's what's gone. Is that it? Zoyla and friends can take care of that! There. Just stand on that spot. They are your source of happiness! Or look at Mommy instead. There! Look at Mommy! Is that a smile I see? You look beautiful in that. - Smile! - One more... - How about a sun dance? Come on! - Come on, Laida! - She's gonna smile! - Hurry up. - Just a little smile? The sun is setting. - I have an idea! Miggy! Come here. Do this for MET, sir. Come on, sir. Go on, sir. He's gonna do the sun dance! Game, sir! Yeah! Great moves, sir. Will this do? I'm sorry, guys. Blame it on global warming... Sun dances won't work anymore. All right. Let's have a break first. - OK. Break. - Laida must be tired. - Oh, pizza! - That's my favorite. - Pizza! I'll eat them all! - Thank you! - Hey, eat slowly, OK? - Let me have some, please. Dig in! Eat some more! Well, aren't you the lucky girl? There. The only thing that can melt a heart of stone... Is what? Is the power of love. Oh no, she's here. - Oops, slowly. - This is really heavy. - I gotta go... - I'll take a photo of you, sister. - Bye. I'll go ahead. - Bye, Laida. Bye. - You want coffee, my dear? - No, Mom. I'm good. - I'll take a picture of you. - Leo. - Leo, let's go. - Wait, Mom. - One... two... - Enough of that Leo. - Dear, let's go. - Stop it, go to sleep now. - Come along. - Let's go back in. - OK, good night. - Bye, bye. Laida. Laida, we will not stop until we make you genuinely smile. - Laida! Sing! - Please. Go on, that's your song! - She doesn't want to. - Sing it for us, Zoyla! Do it for MET. That's enough. Let's wrap this up. I'm sure we managed to get a few shots earlier. There's still so much work to be done, man. I really don't know. Let's just ask the boss. Sir, your coffee. Where's Zoyla? She's talking to one of our suppliers. And Laida? She hasn't arrived yet. How was your edit, by the way? We have so much to work on, sir. We might get some good shots from New York. All right. Let's just give it our best shot. I have confirmed the meeting with MET. So you won't have to worry about anything. And I say, I quit. Why? No, Laida. Why? Why? Why? Tell me. Hey... Why, Laida? I can't take it anymore! What? Being around you. I thought I was OK. But I was wrong. It's still painful. The pain is still here. It's still about that? It's still about the past? Yes. You threw away everything we had because of a single mistake I made. Me? Was I the one who threw it away? Wasn't I that 16-year old girl who was already in love with you? Wasn't I the one who courted you? Wasn't I the stupid girl who put up with everything? Your pride, your ego and all your issues! And because I failed to do one thing, to come to you when you needed me... I was in a different country. I had a job. I had a boss to answer to. I had my mother who also needed me but I still chose you. I was just late, Miggy. And yet, you threw away everything we had. Your apologies will never be enough. What else should I do? I don't know. Won't you ever forgive me? I don't know how. - Water? - OK. Look at you, you're sweating so much. - Were you not hurt? - Gosh. You know I was. You were the one who took care of me then. So you just chose to accept the pain? You have to understand that nobody is perfect. Sometimes, we do things that can hurt other people. Mom... How does a person forgive? Are you ready for that? Because, Laida, forgiveness is a decision. When your father and I got back together, I kept a message on my cell phone... "Choose to forgive. Choose to love." That became my mantra every day. Because despite everything I went through, it was never easy. Mom, how did you get through it? Through my love for him. They say... It's the same with forgiveness. It's also a choice you make, Laida... every single day. - Give me that! - This is mine! Give it to me! Hey! You might disturb your sister! - Mom, look at Leo... - You two should stop that. Come and sit down. Sit. - I saw a text message. - Good morning, mom. Have some eggs. I'll just have coffee, Dad. Sister, have you seen this? Art? What was this article I read? About Miggy... So you know. How embarrassing. Since when? How did this happen, Miggy? It was my fault. I screwed up. So much that... It all went downhill from there. I did nothing right. Everything seemed to fall apart. People thought that I stopped caring. So I told myself to let things be. That's what I'm best at, after all. I'm Miggy. I really was born to fail. So, if I can't take away your anger... and if you can't forgive me, I'll understand. If they no longer trust me and they think I'm worthless, then it's my fault. It's not my family's fault. Not for myself. But for my family. Laida, someone's looking for you. - Benj. - Ma'am, sir Miggy sent this to you. - I'll go ahead, Ma'am. Thank you. - All right. Thanks! She might be near. She's near. Promise. Give her 15 minutes. I'm sure there was a traffic jam. Ten minutes. In ten minutes she'll be by the checkpoint. Five minutes. In five minutes, she'll be running towards us. Three minutes. In three minutes, she'll arrive. She's just playing a joke on us. Or she's probably inside, just waiting for someone to woo her. In one minute, Laida will arrive. No. One more minute waiting here and I will surely miss the flight. Here are all the files. In case Laida doesn't show up. We made an alternative presentation. Our mock issue's not there, but we compiled our past issues together. Sir, let's just wait for a few more minutes for Laida. You know she can be a slowpoke sometimes. Yeah. Guys, it's OK. - We'll give it our best shot. OK? - Good luck, sir. Laida's not here yet. You closed the deal with all your sponsors. - Don't worry. OK? - What time is it? The traffic was horrible! Let's go? Come on. Wait, sir. Before you leave, we'll give you something for good luck. A group power hug! - We have to go. Let's go. - You can do it! - Bye, Zoyla. Bye, guys. - By the way, sir! We emailed you the additional files. OK, here. Laida, let's go. So what now? - It's peak season. - Do you want us to freeze outside? We'll freeze outside, like her hair! Enough... That's not helping. So what do I do now? All right. You can stay in my apartment in the meantime. You can stay on the couch. Really? I know that look of yours, Miggy Montenegro! Just come with me! Are we close? We're nearly there. Where are we going? - Over here. - Where? - There. - What? I have a Persian housemate, and she has her American boyfriend with her. So there's lots of room for you on the couch. It's quiet here, too. - Let's go. Here's my room. - I'm going to work. No noisy. Are we sharing the bed? Where do I sleep? How cold. What did you say? I said, it's cold outside. I missed this! What are you doing? Resting. I'm tired. No. We have a mock-up to do right? And Zoyla requested we work on the "after" version... so we can send it to them so that they can start editing it. We have so much to do. OK. Don't touch me! Let me get dressed. So what's on our itinerary? OK. Let's go. One month before my contract finished in Toronto, I found a job opening here. I was hired as an assistant at a small printing company. It was a better opportunity with higher pay so I couldn't say no. That's how I ended up here. Come on! Let's go there! Here. Take a shot of me here. Posing in front of the Laundromat. Just do what I tell you. - OK? - OK. Hurry up. You know what? You see that woman? I was a lot like her back then. After a long day, no matter how exhausted you are from work, you still have to do everything alone. Let's go. Thank goodness for coffee! It kept me awake, but was also my instant heater! Wait. Do what you were doing. - I'll take a picture of you. - OK. Here we go. OK. This was my neighborhood before. Are there any new tenants here? - Really? - Yes. - Hi. - Hello. - Hi. - Is it OK if I take a look at my old room? We just need to for our project. Chai! We have visitors. Chai? Hey, Excuse me. - Is Chai here? - Chai? Hello. I'm Laida. I'm a former tenant here. Is it OK if I peek into my old room? - Laida. Laida! - Manang! Long time no see! - Come! Have a seat! - No, I'm OK. Come here! What happened? You left in such a rush back then, and you never came back to visit us. - I'm sorry. - You're so beautiful! Your face is blooming. Is it because of this guy? Of course not! Wait... is this... Billy? - Billy? - Right? Remember? I texted you winter of last year. I said that an old friend of yours was looking for you. Of course I wasn't going to give him your number and new address. And you, young man, did not leave your contact number with me. But... this means that... And he's so handsome. You two look good together. Can you still edit it? She said hi too. First... Why didn't you tell me that you'd come here? When did I have the chance to tell you? You still won't forgive me, right? And the second question? Why did you come here? You would forgive me if you saw me and we could get back together. But you already had Belle, right? We only hooked up after I left here. - It's so cold. - This is uncomfortable. - Do you want to come up here? - Can I join you there? - Do you want to come up here? - Is it OK? It's OK, but... It's just that... How do we do this...? How do we...? - Do you want to put...? - Sure, it's OK. We can just... sleep facing the edge, right? There! You should shower and then I will shower... Before me. I mean, after me... Hurry up, we can't be late. How close? Hello, Zoyla! Why are you still there? He has a point, right? What? Do what? No. You don't have to. Who's the boss here? Fine. I'll just wear... Where do we go first? OK. - Can you do it on your own? - I can do it now... What? Can you do it? Ouch! That hurts. Is it snowing? - Here... - There's not even... Here. Why isn't anyone noticing me? OK, here. Hooray! - Do you understand the game? - Sort of. Oh my gosh. Let's wait for him at the backstage exit! - Wait for me. - Excuse me. Let's hurry. We might miss it. - Wait, where are we going? - We're going to see Ricky Martin. My baby! Baby, how are you? - I'm good. - We missed you. - Where do you live now? - Introduce your friend to us. Gotta go. We're trying to catch Ricky Martin. Goodbye, Aunt Angie. - Come on. - Oops. Sorry. Let's go there. Too bad, we missed it. Too bad! We're too late... We didn't see Ricky Martin. Let's go home. Hey! Let's go. Miggy! - Oh, yes. - Oh no... Who told you that you need Ricky Martin? Hey, that's embarrassing. - Let's go? - Let's go. I told you. You don't need Ricky Martin! Get up! We're gonna be late! - OK. - Get up! Yeah. Wait... OK, let's have breakfast. What's this? Don't read that! It's nothing! - Don't... - Let me just see it. - They're my presentation notes! - But it's a scrap of paper. - It's just a note, right? Let me see it! - Those are just my notes for the meeting later. - Let me see! - Give it to me. Stop it. Yeah. Well, you really are handsome. I'll just take a shower. Good thing I found out from Zoyla that the meeting was moved. I still made it. I'm good. - Take this... - Let me help you... Dad, I'm sorry it took me a while to forgive you. - Sorry. - I should be the one apologizing to you. I'm sorry for the mistakes I made. Please, forgive me. Let's start over. Yes, Dad. - I love you, Dad. I'm sorry. - I love you, too. - My girl has turned into a woman. - Dad? Look at you! - I'm used to always seeing you so pretty. - My hair's all messy. - I have a comb over there. - Where? Dad. - I missed you, Dad. And I'm sorry. - Thank you, my child. Guess he didn't want to be late this time. But you weren't there. I kept calling you on your phone, but... Painful, huh? Tough luck for me... If I had just stayed in the States instead of coming back for you... But it turns out... Please, tell Laida that I'm sorry. I'm sorry for assuming I could take her place. And what will happen if we don't get Empire? Brother. So I can pay for the investments I lost. Great! Stay calm. Thank you for that warm applause. A few days ago, a writer interviewed me. And he asked me, "Sir, what legacy do you want to leave behind?" That's a tough one. But it got me thinking... What is my legacy? Until one day, I accompanied my youngest son. He said that... More often than not, we aspire to be on top... but we fail to be noble. I'll go ahead. I need to drop by somewhere. If it's OK with you. Ma, you have visitors. I think I know what to do. Leo, don't be too naughty, OK? Rose, take care of our young men here, OK? Yes, sister. - Be a responsible eldest brother to them. - I will. Dad, please behave. OK? - Of course, I can't do that to you. - "I can't do that to you..."? Mom, if you ever visit me abroad again, bring the whole family with you, OK? We'll save up for that. Take care, OK? Yes, Mom. Mom? What...? - Hey, what is it? - Wait. I would like to apply for a job. At the shoe factory? Thank you for getting our permission. But... only Laida can answer your question. But I will be based in New York for a while. Yes, Bebe ko. Yes. I'm on my way, Bebe ko! I will love you forever! Back then, it was my dream to win the heart of Miggy Montenegro. But today, I am grateful that I need not wait any longer for that dream of mine to come true. Our fairytale type of love story wasn't as easy as we thought. I gave up many times. It took a while before I realized that there's no such thing as an instant happy ending. I never thought that at that time... that my future wife was standing in front of me. Forgive me for the times I gave up on you. We learned that in loving someone, you have to accept the good, the bad, the sadness, and the pain. Today, standing in front of you, is a Laida who knows what she is getting herself into. A Laida... who doesn't just want a happily ever after, but a Laida who chooses to have a reality ever after with you. I love you so much, Bebe ko. I love you very much. And I can imagine doing anything else, but loving and serving you all my life. Thank you so much Or... Wait. Or MA! What's that? Of our soon-to-be children. I can't wait to open my eyes tomorrow morning, because... it is you, my dear husband who will greet me a good morning, my companion in life, the one I will love forever! OK. We'll get there. Eventually we'll get there! From our past to our present, and even the in-betweens. Just kidding. Come on, Bebe ko! - Bebe ko? - Yes? I've been ready for five years, Bebe ko! Just a few minutes more! Here I am! Is this OK? How about this? And this? Bebe ko! Do you like this? - Are you ready? - Let's go. Wait, Bebe ko! Slow down! Yes, Bebe ko... Wait! Bebe ko, slow down! - Hold on! - What are we waiting for? - Wait for it... - I've been waiting for so long. Come here. - Wait, that hurts. - Wow, T back! - Is it good? This is too small for me. - Yes! - Wait, that hurts. - Come a little closer. We only have two weeks left before we close our deal. We only have two weeks... Why are you smiling like that? It's hard, right? I already signed that. Welcome, Miss Mangapa... - Cut. - What... They don't have... Sorry. It's your fault, you're late. It's Miggy's fault... - You're silly, Lloyd... - Why? Do you really want me to be back? Why does it have to be like this, Director? Do you really want me to be back? She reminds me of Ate Guy. - Me! - Me! - Cut. - Me! Sorry, Director. What is this? Come on. It's not that easy to pack... to pack... to pack... She doesn't like it. I might fall for him, Director. Do you really want me back? You want it! You want it! Just kidding! What's wrong with... What did you say? Nothing. Ouch! Why? - Why? - Take three. I have lapel mic, just joking! You already had Belle then, right? You already had Belle then, right? That kind of smile... Don't give me that smile. Take six. If you say so. If you say so. Sorry, Director. She felt something, Director. - Cut. - Wait a minute.
