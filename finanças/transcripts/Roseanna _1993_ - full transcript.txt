Hi, dad. What are you doing up so early? This is when you say: "It's about time you came home." It's about time you came home. Don't drink coffee. Think about your stomach. - Wanna taste? - You know I stopped smoking. And you shouldn't smoke. You can get lung cancer. - I don't smoke that much. - You smoke all the time. Why are you up this early? I'm taking a trip to Motala. A dead girl has been found in the G?ta canal. - Murdered? - That's how it looks. Could you be quiet? You're waking up Erik. He can't be woken up. Putte has just arrived back home. I'm going to Motala. I'll probably be away for a few days. I'll go and catch some sleep. That evening class is killing me. Or else it's the hot french teacher that's doing it. I must catch some sleep as well. - Goodnight - Goodnight Don't forget the gun, daddy. We are making a sketch of the deceased. We've rung doorbells without result. If she's from around here, somebody must recognize her. We fished her out eight days ago - - and we don't have a name, no crime scene, no suspects. She's been strangled and sexually assaulted. The perpetrator is brutal and perverted. If it isn't Sherlock Holmes from the national police himself! How do you catch a perverted woman killer, Detective Inspector? This is Gunvald Larsson, my colleague. The press conference will be held tomorrow. The problem is just that we don't have any news. Then we tell them she was murdered somewhere else - and washed up here by coincidence. Is that an option? Not for a second. Where's Lennart Kollberg? Now we've moved to page twelve. Those poor bastards don't have it easy. - Who do you mean? - The tabloid journalists. "The mystery grows thick regarding the murdered woman in Motala." "The experienced police investigators are fumling in the dark." Where do they get all that? - "The naked beauty in lake B?ren." - It's called Boren. It's hard to believe nobody misses her. - Have you seen her? - Yes. Shit. According to Gunvald Larsson the current can't have brought her here. Gunvald Larsson can crawl up his own tailor-made ass. Shall we drive? I have to get started on my reports from the house calls. Here's one that spends four pages on a one-eyed cat - - and handles three murders in a half sentence. See you. He could have backed his car up here and thrown her in the water. Or she was thrown in the water from a boat. About a hundred leisure boats pass here every day. And then there's the canal boats: Diana, Juno and Wilhelm Tham, - - but they only sail daytime. - Is it always this crowded? - As you can see. Will you arrest the perpetrator soon? That's possible, - - but unfortunately, at present we can't give a correct answer. - Have you identified the girl? - No. - Could she be from around here? - That doesn't seem likely. In that case we would have been able to identify her. So you think she's from a different part of the country. - How old was she? - Between 25 and 30. A sketch artist has made a picture of her - - they way she might have looked alive. You're going back to Stockholm? We can't do much more here. But good luck. We will contact Interpol. How do you get to Link?ping from here? - Shouldn't we? - Isn't that where she can be seen? I'll call and tell them you're coming. - I'll drive you to Link?ping. - I can take the train. The train doesn't connect that way in this country. I want you to make a new description of her to me personally. - Details, how she... - How she looked when she was alive? Greyish blue eyes, blond hair. Wellkept teeth with no fillings. No surgical scars or other marks - - except a mold on the inner left thigh. Narrow shoulders, thin waist and narrow hips. Just above medium height. Long legs and muscular calves. Normal feet, size 37. You can take a cab there. I don't give a shit that it's overtime... Martin, any news about the Arvika killing? - No, it's with the District Attorney. - And M?nsson? In Motala? I haven't heard from him in a month. Nothing's happening. Nobody's reacted to the drawing of the deceased - - and we don't even know where she was murdered. She could have been thrown in the water from a boat, - - but passenger boats only sail during daytime... I've received word from Interpol in the USA. The description matches perfectly: 27 years old, average height. Traveling around Europe alone. It's coming up. Here's the photo. Let me introduce our murder victim, miss Sylvia... Nice try, Skacke. But Detective Inspector Beck has other things to attend to, - - so you'll have to handle the foreign countries yourself. Try the embassies again. You can have this framed. She hasn't given birth or had an abortion. She wasn't murdered in connection with ordinary intercourse. No traces of semen. 3-5 hours before she died, she ate. Veal, potatoes, strawberries, milk. No traces of alcohol or drugs. No traces of disease or organic changes. She didn't smoke. Are you up? I couldn't sleep. You come home late. I'm sure she ate at a restaurant. Cooked veal with potatoes. Strawberries with milk. That doesn't sound home-cooked. We're checking everything. We've been to every restaurant within 70 kilometers. Yes, I'll call back. Goodbye. What's on your mind? I've had a little chat with the captain of the canal boat Diana. Sporadical showers. Don't think about it any more. It's neither the first time nor the last that we have to give up. As if being a good cop is something special. That's not exactly what I'm thinking about. It's not good for morale to go pondering. Shall I sign it? Detective Inspector M?nsson has news about the deceased in the G?ta canal. Better late than never. Precisely. Where did the corpse come from? From a boat? Possibly a leisure boat. Passenger boats only pass in full daylight. But then someone from the uniformed police says, - - that he saw a canal boat pass in the middle of the night. Late June. Gunvald Larsson has spoken to the shipping company. They have confirmed. The name of the boat is Diana. I called the captain. And now he could remember. They suffered from engine failure and had to stay outside of Soderkoping for 8 hours. That how they didn't pass Borenshult till after midnight. Which day? Their fourth trip in June. The night upto the 24th. 4 days before we found her. My name is Benny Skacke. Benny Skacke, detective assistant... Detective inspector Benny Skacke. National Police, Andersson speaking. No, he's not here. He's not back until three o'clock. Do you know what they served for dinner on the canal boat Diana on the 23th of June? No. What they found in the corpse's stomach: Cooked veal and strawberries for dessert. You can get the passenger list from the shipping company. I have to catch my train. Already? Next week I go to Malm?. I got the job down there. Congratulations. - Am I interrupting? - You always are. There's a fax from Detective Inspector Kafka from the USA. Kafka is from Prague, and he's dead. Detective Inspector Elmer B. Kafka, Nebraska. He's sending a picture of a girl to Martin Beck. Roseanna McGraw, librarian. A librarian from Nebraska. Good luck. Roseanna McGraw. - Chief Svalberg. - Martin Beck. So you think she was murdered in here? Hello, Greta. And as usual I will prove your theories wrong. How long can we be here? A month at the most, then the ship is going to be dry docked. - But you need it tomorrow. - Yes, please. - Where are you going? - I've received a package. 68 according to the list. - No addresses? - No, just their nationalities. It's going to be hard work sorting them out. We can take som off right now: Children and old women. I have the addresses of the personnel and crew. Do we know if she was traveling alone? At least she had the cabin to herself. 15 Swedes: 5 Anderssons, 3 Johanssons and 3 Petterssons. 21 Americans, or 20. 12 Danes, 4 English, 1 Scots, 2 South Americans, - - 2 Japanese, 5 Dutch and 2 Turks. Let's put Gun on this. - Gunvald Larsson. - Is he here yet? You didn't know? - He's been transferred by... - Hammar. I think he's supposed to be here permanently. This is a video from Kafka. He's questioned some people who knew Roseanna. - Is this for a private sexual report? - I've told you, it could be important. How long were you together with Ms. McGraw? - About 8 months. - Why did you break up? I fell in love with her. I don't quite understand. I was in love with her for some time, but I didn't tell her. - Why not? - I wanted to keep her. When I finally told her... Roseanna was very independent. Completely open and natural. She never wore makeup or jewelry. She didn't wear a bra, didn't like wearing shoes. - Was she difficult to satisfy? - Not for me. Did she display great variation in her sexual technique? What an expression. No! She was always on her back with a pillow under her hips and her legs spread. She was completely open and natural in everything she did. - I understand. - You don't understand shit! Hi; Martin. I'm Kafka. I hope this interview is useful to you. I could try to find more of her associates - - but I'll wait for your decision. I hope you catch the bastard who did this. Give him a little message from me: Castrate him in public. Let's talk. Good bye. Oh, there you are. Kollberg showed me the passenger manifest from the boat you're working on. He thought I might be on to something. And I am. - What? - Karl-Ake Eriksson. The machinist? His real name is Karl-Ake Eriksson-Stolt. One year in prison for sleeping with a 12 year old girl. You don't remember him? A cheeky son of a bitch. Yes, I think so. Are you sure? I've checked with the Seamen's Agency. It's him. He lived with his mother in Hagalund. He was unemployed. Then he got the landlord's 12 year old daughter drunk on moonshine. The doctor feared she would get lasting damage from the shock. He got a year. Unpleasant guy. - Do you know where he is? - I've taken care of that too for you. He signed on to the M/S Kalajoki. A Finnish freight boat in the free port. He's discharged now. He lives on Nordre Kaj. What the hell is this about? - Karl-Ake Eriksson-Stolt? - Yes, that's right. Eriksson-Stolt, Karl-Ake. Born 23-11-55 in Hagalund, Solna. Occupation: Sailor. Last signed on to the Finnish ship Kalajoki. Is that correct? - Answer yes or no. Is that correct? - Yes, damn it. Where did you live before you signed on to the Finnish boat? With my mother. - Did you have a job? - No, I was sick. - What did you do before you got sick? - I worked on a boat. - Whose name is? - Diana. What did you do there? I was hired as machinist. - How long did you work there? - All summer. Did you meet any girls there? The only one worth watching was in with the chef. - The others were just old ladies. - What about the passengers? You didn't see much of them. I didn't meet any girls there. Can you remember if anything unusual happened on board this summer? What do you mean? Didn't the machine break at one time? Yes, there was a waterpipe that broke. We were in S?derk?ping, and it took hell of a long time. When you left S?derk?ping, were you working? Yes, we had to work like hell all three of us. When in the day did you get off? The day after S?derk?ping? It must have been late in the afternoon. What did you do when you got off? What did you do when you got off from work? - Nothing. - You must have done something. - What did you do when you got off? - Nothing, I've told you. You must have done something. Did you meet anyone? Think hard. What do you think there's to do on an old boat? Playing soccer? OK, let's go over it again. When you worked on the canal boat Diana, - - did you get to know any of the passengers? We weren't allowed to be around the passengers, - - and I didn't care about those stupid tourists anyway. Do you recognize her? Who is it? Don't answer right away. Take a good look at her. Have you seen her before? No. Roseanna McGraw. Does the name tell you anything? - That's a strange name. - Roseanna McGraw was American. She got on board the Diana in Stockholm on June 21st. You have confirmed you were on the boat. When the boat came to Gothenburg, Roseanna wasn't on it. She was murdered on the night between June 23rd and 24th. The body was found in a lock basin i Borenshult. It was in all the papers. I haven't murdered anyone. I haven't seen her before. What did you do on the night between the 23rd... I was in my cabin, sleeping. I've never touched her. I swear it. You could have gone harder on him. We can always pick him up again. Would Roseanna really fall for someone like Eriksson? You may not believe it, - - but he could have waited in her cabin and attacked her there. Here's Greta's report. There were 14 blood splatters on the bed and the carpet. The blood type matches Roseanna's. Now we know that's where it happened. Let's say we know. When? The night between June 23rd and 24th after sunset. She undressed herself. Voluntarily, probably, - - as there are no traces of torn clothing. What do we know about the perpetrator? Sadist. Sexual pervert. Male. Karl-Ake Eriksson-Stolt. I want a burger. How the hell can a person just disappear halfway - - without anyone noticing, not even the cabin maid? - You don't want it? - No. Whoever killed her must have stayed on board... It didn't taste good. ...and cleaned up the cabin so it looked normal. What about sheets and carpets? Nothing's missing. If the murderer was known on board, he could have fetched new bed linnen. You don't think someone would have noticed? Do you want coffee? That's not too hard to arrange. Haven't you ever been on board a passenger boat at night? Everyone's sleeping. And all closets and storage rooms are open. The passenger boat sailed through Lake Boren during the midwatch. We know with certainty three persons were awake: The two on the bridge and one in the machine room. - Did you want coffee? - No. None of the passengers could have done it. They're watched too closely. And they know too little about the routines on board and the sailing route. And none of the crew could have done it. They watch each other too closely. And their opportunities to see the passengers were limited. This means nobody murdered Roseanna McGraw. My theory is pitiful as usual, but we have Karl-Ake... Hello, are you listening? Yes, of course. She must have met someone. There has to be lots of photographs. People get off at every lock and photograph each other. There must be hundreds of photos sitting in photo albums by now. And videos. You're on to something. We've already located the Swedish passengers. Aren't there any nearby? Yes, on Norr Malarstrand. An old colonel and his wife. Here's Major Jentsch himself. The Major's wide must have taken this. This is me and my wife. The lady I'm talking to is Mrs. Liebeneiner. She's German. She ate at our table. Excuse me, the blond girl? Yes, I recognize that little girl. She was Dutch or English. Are you sure you recognize her? Yes, most definitely. She ate at our table at least four or five times. I recognize the dress. The decolletage. She's only present in three photos. Two with your friend the colonel, and one with a flock of tourists. Three lousy pictures after two weeks' work. Yes, but now it's done. I've looked at them all now. Nothing. On a language learning trip to Brighton instead of going to Japan? - Brighton is nice. - I don't care about Brighton. - My shoes are from Brighton. - I'm not going on a language learning trip. I've saved every penny for one and a half years to be able to afford this trip. In two weeks the boat leaves for Leningrad... I mean Saint Petersburg. And I've bought a ticket for the trans-Siberian railroad. - It's dangerous. - No it isn't. My sweet Putte, all of Russia is in a state of disintegration. Anything can happen, and everything happens over there. I don't want anything to happen to you. - Dad, can I have 20 crowns? - You've received your allowance. - What do you need 20 crowns for? - Wine and women. What's that noise? I'm trying to learn pass? simple. Putte wants to go on the trans-Siberian railroad. Haven't we talked about this? I think it's a great idea. I've always dreamed of doing it. - How about a tenner? - No! Who the hell uses Super-8 these days? Svend and Else Jensen from Randers in Denmark. Both are retired. - Isn't Randers in.. - It's in Jutland. "The beautiful girls in Randers." It's a Danish expression. They can't have been thinking of Mrs. Jensen. The weather got bad. They were stopped by fog before Havringe. This has to be her. She's got less than a day left here. The man in the blazer is Wilfred Belamy from Oregon, USA. Get ready for this. Here she is, and it looks like - - she's talking to the guy with the sports cap. It's west of S?derk?ping. She's got about ten hours left. This is west of Lake Roxen. They've just passed the Berg lock. This is the last lock before B?renshult. Borenshult. Karl-Ake Eriksson-Stolt. There's also a bicycle here. We haven't seen the guy with the cap before. He's not on my list. It's a deck passenger. The bicycle hasn't been on the boat since the start, has it? It doesn't turn up until after the lock in S?derk?ping. Thats where we saw the guy with the cap in profile for the first time. Can we make a still image from the negative of the film? I'll make a mark by him in the book. Let's move on. It's possible I've sold him a ticket. This is her. I see 2000 tourists every summer. And most of the time I'm up here on the bridge. Are there often deck passengers on the cruises? It used to be more common. But I suppose there's always someone. Where do they usually get on board? Anywhere the boat anchors or by the lock. - Like in S?derk?ping? - Sure, why not? - They don't get on the passenger manifest? - No. But if he ate on board, the waitresses might recognize him. - Do you have any names? - Ask in the office. - Is it all right if I speak to him? - Yes. You don't know his name? Andersson or Nilsson or a common name like that. Karin mentioned it in passing. I've seen him over the years. He usually sails along for a part of the stretch as a deck passenger. What's the name of your friend? I wouldn't call her a friend. We were just colleagues. Karin Larsson. We've worked together during a few summer seasons on the Diana. Do you know if they were close friends? She met him a few times when she had time off. But then she stopped talking about him. It ended, - - or something happened between them towards the end of the summer. I think she moved home to Norrt?lje last autumn. No. I know you know him. You met him on the canal boat Diana. I told you, no. I've never seen him before. And I'm on my way to work. Are you leaving already? I was going to make coffee. I don't have time. Why are you lying? I can prove that you've met this man several times. I want to know who he is. It must be some kind of misunderstanding. Leave me alone. She's welcome to contact me. My private number is there too. Do you know his name? No, she never told me. But it has to be him. Karin hasn't been herself after that. First she was in the hospital, and then she came home to me again. - Why was she in the hospital? - I don't know. Karin never tells me anything. When your children grow up... - Which hospital was it? - Norrt?lje General Hospital. At the opening of the uterus and on the back wall of the vagina there were wounds - - that have to stem from a hard and sharp object. In the opening of the vagina there were scratches - - indicating that the object must have been rather large. Some kind of blunt instrument. Maybe a bottle. It must have been some perverted maniac who has done it. I asked her how it happened - but she maintained that she had done it herself. I didn't believe her, and she knew it. In the end she didn't even try to sound convincing. She just repeated that she had done it herself. Can I use your phone? - Do I press the zero first? - Yes. This is Detective Inspector Beck. We met this morning. Do you know where your daughter Karin is? She came back right after you left. She packed some clothes in a bag and took a cab to the station. She was going to Gothenburg to find work on a boat. Boat? Putte. Say hi to dad. Goodbye, Putte. Have a good journey. Take care of yourself. Are you so busy with your murderers that you forget your own children? Dad, someone called. It was important. A Karin Larsson. - What did she want? - It was something about a name. - What name? - I wrote it down by the phone. Goodbye. Write! Folke Bengtsson. We can look at that model in here. - This one? - Yes. And would you like it in off-white? Just around this corner. Folke Bengtsson works as a salesman. He sells complete bathrooms and mixing fittings. On ten days out of fourteen the following occured: At 07:00 he rolls up the curtain. At 07:01 he opens the window. At 07:35 he opens the window slightly. At 07:40 he comes out wearing jogging clothes and goes for a run. He returns half an hour later. At 08:40 he walks to the G?rdet subway station - and takes the subway to Odenplan. At 12:01 he goes to one of two lunch restaurants. He eats vegetarian pizza, fish or a salad with shrimps. Sometimes cheese and ham. At 12:20 he takes a fast walk in the Observatory gardens or the Vasa park. At 12:50 he returns to work. At 18:05 he leaves the business, buys a ticket at Odenplan - - and takes the subway home. He's watched TV at home ten out of fourteen evenings. The other evenings he's gone to soccer games - - eaten out alone or gone to the movies. See you tomorrow. He doesn't look at girls in the street - - but sometimes gazes at windows in sports shops. Boo! Did you sleep well? Go home to bed. He neither subscribes to nor buys any newspapers. But he reads "Technology for everyone" and a boring sports fishing magazine. He doesn't have an orange 10-gear Crescent bike - - but a new mint green mountain bike, parked in the basement. What's he like? He seems healthy, strong and boring. Moves in a relaxed manner, dresses sporty, doesn't seem nervous. It could go on like this until he goes on vacation next time. Let's pick him up. So this is Folke Bengtsson. Martin Beck. I'll be leaving. Sit down. Do you know why we've asked you to come here? Actually, no. It's possible you could help us with a case. What would that be? How did you spend your vacation this summer? I was in different places. Like two weeks on the west coast. Did you drive? I don't have a car, not even a driver's license actually. I ride a bike. It's good to keep in shape. I try to do it myself. I've considered getting a 12-gear... Mountain bike. I have one. It's italian. - You rode it this summer? - No, not that one. This summer I had a different one, a Crescent. Were you anywhere else than on the west coast? I also spent a week in Mem. And after that I took a boat to Gothenburg. - From Mem? - No, from S?derk?ping. - I went on one of the canal boats. - The Diana? Actually, yes. Do you recognize this woman? She seems familiar. - Who is she? - She was on board the Diana this summer. I think I remember her. What's her name? Roseanna McGraw, American. Yes, that's right. She was on the boat. I spoke to her a few times. As well as I could. You haven't seen or heard her name since then? Actually, no. So you don't know she was murdered on that very trip? No. I didn't know that. Is it true? It's strange that you haven't heard about it. - Quite honestly, I don't believe you. - I can explain that... ...because I never read newspapers. You don't have a TV? Yes, but I only watch nature shows and movies. Why don't you read newspapers? There's nothing in them that interests me. It's just politics. And murder and misery. Did you spend a lot of time with Roseanna McGraw? Not really. I spoke to her on 3 or 4 occasions. During which part of the trip? It must have been the first day. We had company between Berg and Ljungsbro. Passengers go ashore there, while the boat passes the lock. - Have you made this trip before? - Yes, several times. Do you know where Roseanna McGraw's cabin was? Did you hear my question? Do you know where Roseanna McGraw's cabin was? Yes, I was trying to think. No, I don't think I ever found out. - You never followed her down there? - No. The cabins are terribly small, and two people share each cabin. - Always? - Some people travel alone. But that's expensive. Roseanna McGraw. Did she travel alone? I haven't thought about it. She didn't say anything about that, as far as I remember. You never joined her in her cabin? Actually, no. It wasn't you who killed Roseanna McGraw? Do you think so? I'm sorry for the inconvenience. But maybe we can help you get home? Thanks, but I'll take the subway. I'll find my own way out. - I let him go. - Of course. - It's better to wait. - What are we waiting for? Do you think he did it? We have to find something. Good night. Find something? Is there anything to find? Good night. The daily news. All of a sudden he reads newspapers. Wait here a second. I'll be right back. Where are you going? Visit someone in the hospital. Where did you go? What if he? So far he's never made the run in under 27 minutes. These pictures of half naked ladies - - pierced by a sharp object - - were under the suspect F. Bengtsson's refrigerator. - Who's he hiding them from? - Where did you get them? Violation of personal privacy. He's also started reading newspapers. Don't leave them lying there in the open. Lennart. Lennart! - Are you getting old? - Yes, I'm beginning to feel my age. I've exchanged a few faxes with Kafka. Make a trap. - Make a trap for him. - A bait. Yes, why not? It's completely voluntary. You can say no. If it's successful... If he's turned on by me, what then if he..? You never have to be afraid. We'll always be nearby. You've questioned him. He has to be suspicious. Always keep a good relation to the press. Once in a blue moon it can be useful to you. MURDER ON G?TA CANAL UNDER INVESTIGATION You have to learn everything about the case now. It's important. You're going to become Roseanna McGraw. Last I played theater was in school. Is this really allowed? It's our only chance. He needs an impulse, and we're going to give it to him. If we don't do it, someone else will. Someone who can't defend themself. It'll be all right. First time? Good thing I met a professional. I need help. I'm redoing my bathroom. I have an old disgusting bath tub from the turn of the century. Since I'm alone and only take showers - - I want to replace the bath tub with a shower room. - Shower cabin. - Right. What choices do I have? We have four models to choose between. They're on display over there. Yes, there are the shower rooms. This looks good. Maybe I'll take this one. You need to know about drains and wall constructions. - Can you help me with that? - I don't know. Either way we have this model, and we can also look at that one. Sure, you have to choose. Which one would you choose? Really, I don't know. This model is the cheapest - - but the finish on the first model is decidedly better. You might as well buy quality when you're finally at it. Yes, that is recommendable. And the installation is included in the price. It's all here in the brochure. Many people fix it themselves, but I'm so bad at practical things. It's not unusual for the water to end up in the apartment below. ?sa, it's Martin. Can you see if it's working? We'll try again. I'm hanging up. You just pick up the receiver - - and you'll have contact with one of us here or down at the station. We have our own channel. Was that Lennart arriving? Yes. It's going to look great. And the government is paying. Time to start the drill. I'm hanging up. - This is Skacke. See if you can catch me. - With pleasure. - Lennart, did you get that? - Yes, I got it. - He seemed nice. - Who? Folke Bengtsson. I think he seemed nice. - Are you sure he's the one? - We're working on it. Nice? Well, we'll see. Watch out, here comes to bogey man. - Understood - This is Lennart. I understand. Skacke is inside now. - What are we going to do now? - You're the killer. It's happening. Tap shoes? Try again. Go in... now! The key is a bit hard to turn. - I heard you on the stairs. - The tap shoes. Was the connection all right? Hello, it's ?sa. Yes, it was. Can I call you back later? You can take your phone off the receiver when he's on his way. Yes, it's alright, and I've gotten much more space in the bathroom. But there is something wrong with the tilt, - - because the water runs over the edge instead of down the drain. Last night I took a long shower, and I didn't notice until afterwards. There was water all over the bathroom floor - - so I was crawling around on all four, trying to dry it up. I need to speak with a professional. Th neighbours didn't complain yet. It would be better if you came by. You already have my address. It's probably just some screw that needs tightening. Drop by some day after work. I would like to see what you have in sinks. He has crossed the Norra Ban square and is walking up Olof Palme road. /7Nu har han sl?bt Skacke rundt By now he has dragged Skacke around for ten kilometers. At least it will keep Skacke awake. Now you made a double error again. He is getting closer, or? Ten kilometers. What is he doing? Ladies' ten kilometers. He is picking up pace now, and is heading towards Norrmalm. - Yes, it's me. - He's on his way. Finally something's happening. How does it feel? - It's okay. - Are you sure? - Do you need to change clothes? - Oh, yeah. Take it easy. Don't panic. He's on his way. We are two minutes from Eriksbergplan. ?sa, he's on his way now. He's leaving now. It seems like he's giving it up. He is heading towards the 47 bus stop. - Kollberg, come in! - This is Kollberg. It looks like he's dropping it. Let's wrap it up. Well there is nothing to do about that. I'm going into the apartment now. That's it for today. Folke is tired. He took a bus from Birger Jarls road. - Would you like some cold chocolate milk? - Sure, why not. If he was normal, he would have broken into the apartment after my performance today. Perhaps he's a bit shy. Understood. I'm on my way. I almost think I've fixed it myself. But maybe I did everything wrong. You've got to come over and check it. You promised me. Don't forget now. By now I'm almost longing for him to come. Gunvald just tripped on the goal line and messed up his fancy pants. - Do you need any help? - No, thanks. Yes, I can see him. Everything's okay. I almost lost him in the restaurant. I see him now. He is walking towards Grev road now. Is your boy called Putte? It's not my son. It's my daughter. Folke Bengtsson has also grown tired with this rain. Then we will have us a break. He is going to the movies. So will I. Understood. Over. That's it for today. Folke has gone to the cinema. - That can't be true. - Yes, sorry. Were going out to eat. Closing time. I guess it's Chinese. What the hell are you doing? Don't you get it's the wrong guy? I don't want to be a part of this anymore. It's too degrading, to him as well as to me. - Listen to us, ?sa. - Lennart. Do you mind waiting in the car? I'll be right there. I don't want anymore to do with this, let's just forget about it all. We can't leave this now. I can't just throw away a month's work. It will be impossible for me to do this all over with someone else. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to be humiliated again. When I hired you for this, you had a choice. You don't anymore. I'm your boss now. I decide if and when this is over. Can't you see, this is just some poor bastard? - He wouldn't harm a fly. - I'll be the judge of that. You don't believe he's guilty. I believe he is. If it is as you say it is, we shall know very soon. And no harm will have been done. We'll try again tomorrow, and next week again if we have to. - Who's replacing Skacke? - I am. Are we going to eat? As soon as Grunvald has removed his tap shoes from the dash board. It's not like you think. I'm a police man. All this, it's a trap. I know. You didn't mean it for real. You just wanted to humiliate me. The woman on the boat? You aren't women. You are animals. Shameless, disgusting animals. And you revel in your filth. I can help you, Folke. I can help you. Do you remember Roseanna? Did you dislike her from the start? Yes, she was pushy, just like you. So you killed her? No. Did i? You don't remember that you killed her? I didn't have to touch her. You were in her cabin, and you undressed her. She undressed herself! She wanted to contaminate me. I had to punish her. You want to make me dirty.. Your body will.. Damned bastard! Tell Skacke to shut the hell up. Shut up, Skacke. We are listening. Would you mind getting out? Hold on! - How are you? - I'm okay. But I'm stuck. That wasn't too good. I'll take the balcony. Let her go! If it hadn't come this far... If he hadn't started abusing me - - then we couldn't have used it for anything. It's not like it's abusive that he visits me - - after all my invitations. So, even if you had been here as planned - - you still wouldn't have intercepted, before he... I don't know. It was completely impossible to guess what would happen. You were right after all. - Do you want me to call someone? - No, thanks. I don't want to leave you like this. I'll call myself. You can leave now. It's me. Come over please. Now.
