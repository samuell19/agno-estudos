Yo, quit holding that blunt, motherfucker. - Pass that shit. Puff, puff, pass. - Man, fuck you. Fuck you too, nigga. Anyway, this nigga said Tamika is a compulsive-ass liar. That bitch lie about everything. You can ask anybody. You can ask her sister, this nigga. Everybody know Tamika Lotterberry is a compulsive motherfucking liar. You see, this nigga ain't saying shit. When the last time this nigga had his mouth closed about anything? Feeding time. Like, this shit is going on under the table, right? Oh, nigga, but am I lying, though, cuz? - No. - See? Exactly. So I take Tamika to Dockweiler Beach, right? Nice sunny day and shit. This bitch start the day off telling a lie so foul, if I said the shit right now, it would open up a new dimension or some CERN-type shit. All I'ma say is, this bitch gonna try and tell me that I didn't see some shit I clearly seen her do, and the reason was because she said it was a full moon, and motherfuckers see all kind of crazy shit during a full moon. I'm looking up, I'm like, "But, bitch, it's daytime." - You know what I'm saying? - High noon in this motherfucker. Exactly. That's what I mean. Unnecessary-ass lies. Now y'all know me. I'm usually cool, calm, collected-ass nigga, right? But this nigga's sister always bring the beast in me. So I had to tell that bitch that day, "Listen, bitch, you lucky you my nigga's sister, feel me? Or I would shoot your ass where you stand." This bitch get all hurt feelings about the shit. She like, "I'm about to call my bro right now." I was like, "So? Call that nigga." When she called you and told you what happened, nigga, your own flesh and blood, nigga, what the fuck you say? Trip. I said, "You lucky you my sister, or Smoke woulda killed your ass." I done told her this shit more than once, but she coming to my job, she like, "Bro, I broke everything in this fucking house." I'm like, "What the fuck you do that for?" Exactly. Bragging about that shit like that shit is cool. Come into my house and broke my goddamn candle I got from Pottery Barn. That fresh-linen smell. The nigga got a candle from Pottery Barn. What the fuck? - I don't know what Pottery Barn is. - Where the fuck you shop at? - Pottery Barn? - I just said Pottery Barn. And then she broke my TV. Whatcha gotta say about that? - My TV. Right. - That's all bad. My coffee table, nigga. You know the shit you put your rice in? Real nigga rule number 303: Never argue with a bitch where you live. You put that bitch out. What the fuck is wrong? What's on your bird, nigga? You fucking hear the story? - We argued, then we fucked like crazy. - Man, fuck all that. Domino, motherfucker. Low man, get up. Dark. Shit, I don't give a fuck, man. Y'all be on some Jerry Springer shit anyway. That's why I pay for my pussy, my nigga. I nut, nigga, they leave. Uh, the fuck you doing? - Here we go. - I can't try out the new merchandise? - Fuck no, nigga. I just got these bitches clean. - Baby, hold up. Let that nigga try the new merchandise. It ain't like he gonna stretch the bitch out. Nigga dick too small. You wrong for that, but you kind of right though. Fuck y'all, man. Shit, y'all niggas ain't never seen my dick. But one of these bitches about to. Fine, but not that one. Fuck it. I'll take this one then. - No! - She's a fighter! Oh, yeah, I'ma have some fun tonight. - Have fun, my nigga. - Come on, bitch. What? Y'all motherfuckers are trash, and you know it. Oh, nigga. This bitch... - Look at this bitch. - Oh, no. Hold up, hold up, hold up. Tiffany, hold the fuck up. When the last time you wash your fucking feet? Them shit's black than a motherfucker. - Man, I took a bath today. - Now, Tiffany, when you got in the bath, did you get in on your motherfucking hands? Kiss my ass. Motherfucker, yo! You good? Goddamn. - No, no, no. It's me, it's me. It's me. - Emilio! Sí. Vámonos. Oscar? Police! Open up! - Freeze! - Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, drop it, or I'll shoot. - I said drop it, buddy! - All right. I'm dropping the gun, all right? Evening. We're doing a sweep of the neighborhood for some kids involved in a nearby gang shooting. Probably illegals. I'd like to come inside, take a look around. I ain't seen no kids. I wasn't asking. You don't have a warrant. You know I don't need one. I ain't seen no kids, sir. Unit Five, identify. You stay safe, now. Are you hungry? My name is John Henry. Okay. Um... Mi nombre John Henry. Did I say that right? I don't know much Spanish. Berta. Berta? - John. - Shoulda named you "dumb-ass motherfucker," what I shoulda did. Bringing in gutter bitches off the street and feeding them sandwiches and shit. BJ. Padre. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't tell gutter bitch my name. Don't call her that. That's where you found her, ain't it? In the gutter? Ain't a place bitches usually end up by accident. - Pops. - Oh, man, this is ridiculous. Next thing, you be bringing John Dillinger in this motherfucker. Padre... loco. You got family? Uh, ¿padre? ¿Madre? Hermanos. Where? I don't understand. Gone. She says they're gone, John. I lost someone today too. You can stay here tonight. Tomorrow, I'll see what I can do to get you somewhere safe. It's the best I can do. ¿Sí? Man, she didn't understand a goddamn word you said. I was thinking maybe she could just get the general tone of what I was saying. Tone? Tone. Goddamn. - What? - When did you learn Spanish? 1989, night school. I was getting it on with this Puerto Rican girl I met at the swap meet. She'd talk all this nasty shit in bed. I want to know what she be saying. - What was she saying? - I don't know. She caught me fucking her sister before I finished the classes. Something wrong? Good luck. With what? First time? Is that... that you, John Henry? Tasha, Compton High. I know I gained a few in 20 years, but... No. You haven't changed at all. Yes, I have, and I am proud of every pound. Put some respect on this thickness. Sorry. No, I was... I was...

Don't never leave the bodies. - Don't ever leave a body? - No, don't ever leave the bodies. Where you put it? That way, you don't never leave their families to grieve. They always going to wonder if they ever out there. Shit! Get out of here! Go! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. You don't understand me anyway. Probably for the best. I never had much to say. I had a friend back in school try to help. She did her best. But never much helped me with words or nothin'. Did get me started drawing. I never did get the hang of drawing dogs. Talby deserved better. That's bullshit, and you know it. Go to sleep for a few hours and wake up in Tijuana. She's from Honduras, John, not Mexico. She's also a goddamn liar. Okay, slow down. - What is she lying about, Pops? - This bitch... Berta said that in Honduras, they got bats that are white. And? And she's full of shit, that's what. Been around a long time. I've seen a lot of fucking bats in my day. I ain't never seen no white bat. You never been to Honduras either. Bats are black or brown, John. If she seen a white bat, it probably 'cause it covered with motherfucking cocaine. Damn coked up-bats probably flying around, - looking for a dick to suck. - Idiota. That word I understood. I don't give a damn what y'all think. Bats are black, John. Berta. Bats are black. Too much white in the world already, if you ask me. Mi nombre... Dude, I'm from Reseda. - Berta said you were her brother. I thought... - Yeah, half. Look, I appreciate all this hospitality and everything, but this is a family matter. I'd like to get my sister and get out. Don't look like she wants to go with you, hotshot. Yeah, well, she'll get over it. Vámonos. No. Goddamn it. After all this shit that I just went... Man, fuck you. All right. - What's that for? - Your gun. Put it in the napkin. - Relax. It's not loaded. - Doesn't matter. It does to me. It's my gun. Inside these walls, it's my gun. Hey, hey. Don't look to him. You don't know him. Look to me. She says to give you the gun. That ain't all she said. Fine. You satisfied? I said, "My boy's strong." So why is she so mad at you? - Because I left him behind. - Who? Oscar. How 'bout we start from the beginning? About six weeks ago, I got this in the mail. It's from her and her brother, Oscar. She drew the flower on it herself. What does it say? It says their mother was killed, so they're coming to find their father. Which is you? When you start fucking, boy? Nine? It wasn't meant for me. It was meant for my father. He was in the military. Spent some time stationed in Honduras in the '90s. Apparently, he left pieces of himself behind. His liver gave out on him about a year ago. Drank himself to death without anyone even knowing he was drinking. Fucking Catholics, right? Anyways, I, uh, got that postcard. I just figured it wasn't my problem. Just threw it in the drawer and... and moved on. And then yesterday... Listen, whatever you guys are selling, I don't want it, but go ahead and pitch it. I'm bored as fuck. These little shits came all the way from Honduras based on nothing but a return address on some letters my father sent their mother over the years. I don't know, man, but they can't stay here. Berta said if they would've stayed, they would've been killed by the same gangs that killed their mother. Four thousand miles packed like cattle on trains on the back of smuggling trucks, past the cartel and ICE, just to end up on my fucking doorstep? Look, man. I deal pills for a friend of mine from Hollywood. He was looking to move some product in the Valley, and I know a lot of junkies, so... I still barely get by, you feel me? I got enough problems already. I couldn't handle another. All right, don't be late. So what did you do? My friend said there was a shelter in Hollywood that helps migrant kids. I was just gonna drop them there and get high till the guilt faded. Berta! Berta! Berta! I've seen that cross before. My connect, he used to get his supply from a Compton gang led by some dude with a metal jaw. All his people, they have that cross tatted on them, like some kind of brand or some shit. But he stopped fucking with them when they went from dealing drugs to dealing women. Look, I know I just met her, but I got her into this shit. She's family. I had to do something. How many? How many what? How many did you kill? I think, like, six. Why? That's how many bodies you owe. The girl. Don't make me ask you again. I didn't hear a question. Shit. Man, what the fuck is your problem? You told me to snatch bitches, so I snatched them.

It almost turned over that time. Hold on. I think I got it. You're a Raiders fan, huh? Since the days of Marcus Allen. Used to sneak into games with my cousin when I was Berta's age. My dad was a big Raiders fan too. Couldn't believe they brought two teams to LA, and neither was a team that LA fucked with. Right? That they built a stadium in Inglewood was insult to injury. - Won't let us have nothing. - For real. How'd you find her? Berta? How did you know which house she was in? I went with my connect on a pickup one time down that block. I just figured it was the best place to start. As luck would have it, when we got there, there she was, looking out the window like she was waiting for us. - So, good luck. - Yeah. Must've been good luck that you had all those guns ready too. Look, man, I already know where you're headed with that shit, and I ain't even like that. I deal some pills to some friends. That's as deep as I get in that crime shit. Just asking. No judgment.

Take it, take Berta, and get as far away from here as you can, tonight. No, man. I can't take money if I don't know the source. Especially if it comes in a bag full of cash. How much money is in here? Fifty thousand. It's better you not ask me where I got it. Shit, I'm not. Where'd you get this money from, John? You bounce out, then come back with a bag full of cash? What kind of shit you into, man? All right. The bad-ass with the metal jaw? - Yeah? - He's my cousin. We've got a history, but he's willing to look the other way as long as you leave town in the next 24 hours. Wait, hold up. Your cousin Hell gave you a bag full of cash to give to me? You expect me to believe that shit? I expect you to take the money, take your sister, and start fresh. No, fuck that. Why'd he give you this money? I need you to trust me. Please. Uh, Berta would like to say grace. Please. Amen. Amen. How come you never make no food like this for me, son? 'Cause you never drew my dog. Mmm. I'll paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel if I can get food like this served every night. Was her mother an artist? I don't know. I never thought to ask. Before you decided to get rid of her, you mean. Your sister. Before bringing her to the shelter. Mm. Like I said. You didn't want to have her disrupt your lifestyle. Pills, right? Pops. Don't disturb me, son. I'm talking. It's cool. Fine. He's right. - What's she saying about Oscar? - Nothing. She wants to know when they're gonna save Oscar. She says he's still alive. Is he? Not dead. How do you know? I... I feel him. Oscar. Not dead. You see? What am I supposed to do? She's not gonna listen to me. Tell her the truth. The truth? The truth. The truth. Emilio! Still got it. - Let's go. - No! No! ¡La pistola! How are you standing? Adrenaline's a hell of a drug, son. Now, don't worry about my legs. Worry about how we get the fuck out of here. They got shooters at both doors. The A/C. You know we can't fit through that hole. She could. Hell, no. Berta can shoot. You can't. I need her. It's the only way she's gonna make it. Get out of here. I'll hold the door. Go, then. Come on. Go, son, go. Go ahead. You want in here? Well, this is BJ Henry's house, motherfucker! No! No! I'm BJ Henry, and my dick is legendary! Twenty-four hours? Damn. That's my mistake. We all owed at least... at least one mistake. Right, John? Why? Respect. What? I told you not to shoot him. - But he was... - He was supposed to see this. You know why I named you John Henry? No. What are you doing here? I... I came to pick up the kids like you asked. I... I guess I was too late. What... What happened here? Hell. - Where... - He leaves no bodies. Then why did he leave you? So I'd feel it. Okay, we need to get you to the hospital, or you're not gonna be feeling anything pretty soon. Don't worry about me. There's something I gotta do. Something fucking stupid, I bet. All that talk in school about how you're not about this life, and now... now look at you. You should go. Yeah, and you should go to the hospital. So I guess we both ain't doing what we should. Here you go. Do you still like it sweet? - Sweet's just fine, Gram. - Yeah. It's my birthday today. Did you know that? I wouldn't remember if it wasn't printed on my ID. I never liked birthdays. Always felt if you know your age, you live that age. Want to know how old I am today? Eighty-two. Eighty-two years old. Still smoking cigarettes and waiting to die. They say these things will kill you, but they sure is taking their sweet-ass time with me. Where is he? Yeah, Helen's daddy was the first of my sons to pass. Your daddy was the last. Good thing you never had any children, John Henry. You never got the chance to outlive 'em. Hmm. Gram. Where is he? You know I can't tell you that. - He... - I knowed what he done. I know everything that boy's done since the first time he walked through my front door looking for a roof to sleep under. My mama said even the darkest soul can still see the light. I tried. It's my birthday today. It's all right, Gram. It's all right. Eighty-two years old... and all I ever seen was violence. It ain't ever gonna stop, is it? It ain't never gonna stop. Thanks for the tea, Gram. Don't go, John Henry. You're not like him. You don't have to do this. You really believe that? Second drawer, left of the sink. He still gets his mail forwarded from them houses he run. Bills and such. As he don't trust the people working for him. I think he just don't want nobody to see his name on them envelopes. If you see the gas bill, could you carry it to him? It's past due. John Henry.

Man, I don't want to know about fucking Germany or no fucking centipedes or no goddamn salamanders or nothing, man. I just want this fucking bread. Corey, what's wrong with you, man? - Just making conversation. - What kind of conversation is that, though? I don't know, nigga. You the one up here using words like "recidivism" and shit. What does that mean? That mean when niggas go to jail, and-and they keep going back, to go to jail, nigga. I know what the fuck I'm talk...

Come on, man! Don't do this! Yo, I don't even know this nigga! Ah, shit! No! You know why I named you John Henry? Motherfucker's beating that car up! Damn. BJ sure did love that car. Keep my father's name out your mouth. Ooh. So aggressive, John. Always knew you had it in you. Then you should know I'm not done. You know, you could tear my empire down brick by brick. Doesn't change the fact that we got the same blood coursing through our veins. Nigga, we family. Not anymore. Is that a threat? A prediction. You ready? Lay down, John. You know, I don't use a gun either. But not 'cause of no PTSD shit or nothing like that. Nah. I don't use a gun because I don't have to. It ain't enough to just kill niggas anymore. Nah. Now you've got to kill what they believe in. This is Oscar? You know, you asked me once before, "When does it end?" Truth is... it never ends. Heavy lies the crown. Watch how I keep it. Deydey, what the fuck you think you doing? Get your ass over here! Savage, shoot him! Nah. John, I know you. Don't do this. We family, John! I know you! You ain't no killer! You know you ain't no killer! I'm not a killer. I'm John Henry. I said... "My boy's strong. My boy's John Henry." What you gonna do with all that strength, John?
