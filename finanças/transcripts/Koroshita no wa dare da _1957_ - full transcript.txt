NIKKATSU Presents Who's the Real Killer? Cast Ichiro Sugai Hisako Yamane Taiji Tonoyama Akira Kobayashi Directed by Ko Nakahira Owned by a doctor he looked after it. See, only 38,000 on the clock. You don't find many in this condition. America makes far better cars than Europe. Excellent condition. These locks glide open. That's a sign of true quality. So, is this the one you want? I'll discount heavily. I barely make any profit. Telephone, sir. It's an excellent buy. Hello, Sakurai speaking. This is Nakagawa, from Tokyo Auto Market. Sorry to intrude, but it's about that Cadillac you're considering. He's asking 750,000 yen, isn't he? No, it's not too expensive. But I can get it for you for 700,000. No scam, sir. I'm a salesman at Tokyo Auto. There's no doubt, it's a good buy. It'll soon sell. - Look at the motor gain. Clean as a whistle. He barely drove it. Take it around the block. Get in, please. Hey! Is that rat Nakagawa here? No. Did you sell the Cadillac? That bastard. Not again? 600,000 is the best we can do. Too much stock on the market. Yes, of course we pay cash. I'll make my money on our next deal. Don't forget, that was my tip. Good. I'll see you when you get here. It's much appreciated. Nakagawa! You thief! Don't you have any morals? Not in business. I've been working on that car for a month. I just spoke to the owner, he sold it to me. Let me in on the deal. No way. I lined up the car and the buyer. Wait up, will you. Please. I really need the money. Give me a percentage. Come on, I'm begging you. Please. I need this deal. #Peaceful Oasis Diner Another one. That's your last. The sight of you gives me the creeps. Don't you hear the cars any more? Don't they inspire you to get back into it? Listen. These days you look like a tramp. Weren't you one of Dunlop's top men? That's all gone now. You're like a ghost. Can I get a loan? 200 yen will do. "Will do?" I haven't got it. Please, I need it. I'll pay you back. Have you ever paid me back? You've got a job. One more, Yurie. No more! I'm sick and tired of everything. Dad's back. Thank you. Sorry. Any good news? How are you, then? Yurie, I'll be going. Dunlop, what a laugh. I'm leaving early today. You're in good spirits. Leaving already? Yes, I've got something lined up. Where's the code of honor? It's the bedrock of business. Young fellas today will do anything. Give the same back. There's your code of honor. You don't understand. Yes, grumbling old men aren't my forte. There's 10,000 men selling cars in Tokyo. It's a young man's game. Come over here and have a drink. Handing out drinks at this hour, no wonder we're broke. Go and do some work. We're working out a new strategy. Let's get going. So what now? The liquor supplier cut me off. We need 30,000 by the 30th, or we're out of business. So what will you do? Because of you, my life is ruined. Then go with Nakagawa. What are you insinuating? He's always sniffing around you, isn't he? I'm old and used up. Hey, Yano. Been looking for you. You must be rolling in it. Drinking at this hour. There was a big accident down at the crossing. Those taxi drivers are crazy. Can I get a beer? That's good. Frank, I really need that money back now. Bad luck, we both got outfoxed on that deal. I only put up money because you guaranteed it. I bad to borrow it. He said he was selling, so I paid the deposit. Then he ups and runs off with the car and the cash. Yes, but you're responsible. I do feel responsible. I've run out of options. I'm no laughing stock! Calm down. I'll line up another deal. I've got standards, I can't end it like this. Wait, I'll organize something. Wax your car, sir! Cars waxed and polished! What do we pay him for? We have to, it's his territory. But this is a public street. He started the business, we have to pay. Thanks, tightwad. Hey, Mr Shimazaki! Your last movie was fantastic. You were great. I can get a good deal on cars for you. Buy me a coffee and I'll explain. You're so popular now. Nakagawa screwed you again. Yes, he cut me off at the knees. A good salesman doesn't let the drink overtake him. We deal in big money here. You're my boss now. Thanks to you, I've got a job. You're the president of Tatsumi Motors. You've done well. Back in Manchuria, we'd get drunk and paint the town red. I gave up the drink. Since my wife died. It's all been downhill. It was such a shock. Nothing's gone right since then. Where's the 30,000 yen I loaned you? It sets a bad example. If you can't pay, you're fired. Who do you think you're talking to? Firing me over a piddling 30,000 yen. Leave that woman you're shacked up with. Move back in with your daughter and son. That's the root of your troubles. What's important to you? You can't work in this condition. You're in the prime of your working life. Give it a try. Iron your shirts, shine your shoes. Your boy's at university now. Are you sure? You want to leave? My room's upstairs. Who is it? Who's there? It was you, was it? This is not a bar, or a hotel. Who pays the rent? It's Dad's house. It's ours, too. We're free to do as we please. Lemme polish your car, sir. Only 200 yen. I can do it for 100. Where's Frank? You called me, Frank? I had a great deal for you. That movie star, Shimazaki. He's an old pal of mine. He wanted to do a deal, - I called, but you were out. You could have waited. - So what happened? Nakagawa found out about it. You fool! Sorry, but he's as quick as a pickpocket. You asked for a 1954 Desoto, around 1 million yen. It's got eight cylinders, it's not expensive. A pristine Desoto is rare. We went to a lot of trouble to find this one. We've put down the deposit. It needn't be a Desoto. 1.2 million is too much. This one is an exceptional vehicle. If you still need money, I can loan you some. I'm doing well. No, forget it. That's a pity. I was looking forward to it. You're only making Yano suspicious. He's going downhill fast. You're a hot-shot salesman. But there's no need to be nasty about it. There's no such thing as pity in business. Loan me 100,000 for 2 days. I'll give you 10%. Is your boss there? When is he back? Just for 2 days. I don't have it. You can't play this game without capital. If you have money, you get out of sales. How about I buy this place off you? For 300,000 yen. What happens to me? You're part of the deal. I don't have the money, do I? Let's call it off. It's a bit late to say that now. Cancel that order. That's a waste. Keep the change. Watch it, old man! Hey. You want to come? I'm still working. I've got a job for you. - You need help? - I'm almost done. I paid 300,000 for all that. It'll sell for 400,000. We only make 100,000? Is it safe? Last time, we nearly got caught. It's okay. We can trust him. We can have fun with 100,000. Let's bet it on billiards, maybe double it. Okay. #Billiard Hall Keep going. That's good. Nice and slow. Watch that beer. Sorry about that. It get it. Bad luck. Two points, three to go. You got it. You touched it. Penalty. That's a waste. Minus two, leaves you five to go. Three points, you can do it. Well done. This could be it. That's two. Game point. You'll get it. Game set. Want to finish at 10-5? Too good for us. Here, 7,000 yen. Another game? Not today, maybe next time. I'm alt out of luck. Okay, next time. Your cut. Only 1,000, you didn't do much. Thanks, now I get to eat. I love capitalism. Me, too. It takes money to make money. Let me out here. Why? Won't you come along? No. I'd better get home. What about you, Michiko? I'll stay with them. See you. We're old army buddies. I've done my best to help him. After we go demobbed, we found an old car and fixed it up. It took us months to sell it. So far, he owes me 50,000 yen. I've had enough. I'm sorry. He hasn't been to work. Where is he? He's been gone for 2 days. Probably out scraping up your money. He's starting to give us a bad name. I want to see him when he gets back. Beer. Beer! Beer! Share one with me? Where is he? You beat a man old enough to be your father. I hate men like you. I didn't realize you were so upset. I didn't mean to. I came to apologize. You don't look like it. - He's here? - He's not. I've got a deal for him, but only for tonight. You'll only lead him deeper into trouble. No, this is a sure-fire money-maker. What's this scheme of yours? Go back upstairs. Mori was here. Everyone's worried about you. When you're down and out, no one cares. Get me a beer. Beer! Tell me about it. Smash up a car, with finesse. You know, an insurance scam. It's all arranged. All I need is photos of the damage. Why don't you do it? My life's too valuable. Everybody's life has some value. How much? 100,000 yen. Interested? You don't need to know who. Tonight. A hundred grand in cash. Give it a go. Do it, if you've got the guts. But you don't. You're far too cowardly. If you weren't, you wouldn't let him beat you up. Have a damn good crash! Smash it all to smithereens! I do it. I'll show you. Darling, no, please don't. I only said that to snap you out of your torpor. Just knowing that you would is enough. That spark of life is back in you. With that attitude, all kinds of opportunities will open up. I'll do it, Yurie. I want to see what I've got left in me. I've spent 30 years in the motor trade. One crash won't kill me. Don't, I was kidding. Nakagawa, I'm in! - Stop it. - Let's go. Now. Crash 'em all. This'll do. Hit that divider. I'll signal if I see cops. Stop if it looks dangerous. It's enough to pay back Mori and give you something. It'll fix everything. Forget about your debts. This is your chance to quit sales. No police patrols in this area. Are you up to it? Will he be safe? Enough! I can't stand any more. What happened? - Next time. - Get it right. What now? That's enough. I do it. You'll see. Where are you going? Gimme a drink. I've only got spirits. That'll do. Darling, no. Don't do that. Hey, Yano. Oh, Frank. What's going on? I'm gonna crash. Crash what? Frank, stop him. You're serious? I'll make 100,000. Me, too. Let me in on it. You're both crazy. Let me in on it. Get away, will you. I'll drive, we'll go 50-50. No one is going anywhere. Had a drink? Get in. Give me half, I'll drive. Get out. I'm an expert at this. Hit that divider. Okay, you got it. Don't be seen. He needs a hospital, quick. Give me a hand. He had a good Japanese name, but insisted on being called Frank. He always introduced himself as Frank. I asked him many times to quit car detailing. But he always refused. He loved motor cars. He said he was happy just working with cars. He may not have appeared to be too respectable... but he was everything to us. If only I'd stopped him, this never would have happened. I'm so very sorry. It's alright, he brought it on himself. I knew it would end like this. He never listened to a word I said. This is his cut of 50,000. Please accept it. The insurance paid out already? No, but he was promised this amount. How can I possibly tell the children... their father died in an insurance scam? I'm afraid I can't accept it. And I beg you to never do it again. I'm home. Hello, dear. Say hello to your father's friends. Good day. Your cap. They've offered prayers and brought candy. Slow down. What's wrong? It's such a tragedy. Such a good wife, children, too. He called himself Frank. So what? She said he loved cars. And he did. We all do. Bean-jam bread. Bread and jam for me. Why not go back home and drive a truck? I can't stand to see you like this. I'm too old to drive trucks. Then drive buses. In the country we can have a regular life. I've got nowhere to go back to. I'm from a seaside town in Mito. My brother's still there. I'm sure he'd put us up. He wouldn't be happy to see me. We're not even married. Why is Katsuko, so adamant against us marrying? I want you to marry me. You're starting to make me feel homesick. I haven't been back for 20 years. No more house, no more land. Only gravestones. But the Kishu seaside is beautiful. Let's do it, let's get married. You've no future with an old man like me. Let's talk to your children. Maybe we could all live together. Hey, Katsuko! Good, I need to talk to you. Got time for a talk? Sorry about that. This is my lovely daughter. Beer over here! Get out of here! I'm your father, damn it. Your mother would be ashamed. Stop this bloody jazz! Play some Charleston! Please be quiet, sir. I'm salesman, you know. Please, sir. I'm a damn good salesman. Stop this jazz rubbish! Play Charleston. Please, sir. Where is this? He embarrassed me at work. I can never go back now. Katsuko, water. Iced water. Water, I said. Hurry it up. Hello, Jiro. You've made Sis very angry. I'm surprised you still remember where we live. Are you staying tonight? When was it your mother died? It was a night like tonight. The very same atmosphere. As if the lights suddenly dimmed. That's what it felt like tonight. Exactly the same. It's been ten years. I was 45 back then. Still young. We'd been together almost 20 years. You've no right to say that! Jiro, I was heartbroken. I was lonely. After your mom died... it was as if I lost everything that held me up. Things went bad after that. I couldn't take care of you kids. To be honest, I completely lost my way. I didn't know what to do. I can't go back and mend the past. I've fallen as low as I can go. I'm heavily in debt and I've lost all my confidence. Everything I do is a failure. Get out! It's too late to cry now! Too late to bring us back together. Go back to your slut! Dad, where will you go? I'll be back. It's your house, at least stay the night. I'll come another time. Don't worry about what she says. No, she's right. I am a failure. Dad, please stay. Cheer up. If it's about money, leave it to me. I can pay your way. Jiro... #Post Office Bank #Withdrawal / 62,000 yen Account/ Miss Katsuko Yano #One point. Two points. Bad luck. Two points for a total of 4. One down, two to win. Two down, one to go. One point to win. Three points and a win. That was lucky. A fluke. 10,000 yen. You're not on form today. Hey. You're here. Quitting already? That's a fortune. Once more, for 13,000. 5 points to win. 5 points? Okay, sure. Thirteen is an unlucky number. Okay. Shall I teach you? Your noodles. I'll take that. Let's eat later. You to break. You're white. One point. That's a foul shot. Minus 1 point. Shut up! One point. Two points. Total two points. Damn it. One point. Two points. Total 2 points. Two to go. Two points, one to go. Three points and game. Bad luck. Want to win it back? Maybe next time. See you. Have fun. What happened, champ? Wait, loser pays the table. Silly boy, he's out of your league. Last time he let you win. Take it all. I'm so pleased, I was getting desperate. The thing is, I need a new car, anyway. Any profit for you, is payment for the old days. Quit the opposite. You took care of me in Manchuria. Pure coincidence, I hardly recognized you. We've both aged. Unlike me, you've hardly changed. Let me out at Shimbashi. I'll run you home. No, I've got something to do. Bring it tomorrow and I'll pay you then. Thanks, it's much appreciated. No one here? Yurie, a customer. She closed the place down today. The Peaceful Oasis is no more. It's all over. Finished. Has Jiro been here? No. He's always here, isn't he? I got a big one this time. An old army buddy. Now he's a big-time businessman. 1954 Cadillac, 2.5 million yen. When I strike, I'm on it like a bulldog. I can pay you back everything. I'll go and rub it into Nakagawa's face. See you. Hard at it, I sec. Where's Nakagawa? He's out, is he? I'll come again. He's gone nuts. You'll both go back to your hometown? Yes, I'm closing up shop. Too much debt, I can't keep going. I thought you'd end up dumping my dad. We leave tomorrow. We planned to come and say goodbye. Let's celebrate. What a surprise, Katsuko. Jiro stole all my savings. - Why? - I don't know. Over 60,000 yen. He must have needed it. I'll pay it back. I just scored a big one. I told you I shouldn't quit. We're packed to go. Yes, but we can call it off now. I made 250,000. This is just the deposit. An old army buddy struck it rich. Every dog finds a bone. Katsuko, I don't know why, but I feel young again. Quit working at that bar. I'll cover what Jiro took. Everything will go well now. If I'm successful, you'll all be successful. Like that car out there, it's worth 2.5 million. I'll run you home in it. I won't be long. Now there's no need to move to the country. Isn't that right? C'mon, let's go. Katsuko, do you remember? When was it? You were still at high school. You wanted a ride, I took you in my client's car. When Mom was still alive. She was a stickler for protocol. "Kids shouldn't ride in a bespoke car.” But I took you out, anyway. But you got carsick. You should marry Yurie. You were always dead-set against that. She really loves you. Far more than I do. Katsuko, I haven't been a good father. I should have thought more about you and Jiro. You were lonely. As long as you keep doing well, Jiro will make something of himself. Atomic rain makes you bald. What's going on here? Who's that? Why are you packed? Get out! You're in a bad mood. I thought I knew you. You work at the car wash. So what? A student with a license, I'm impressed. You do have one? Can't work the car wash without a license. I've got a good job for you. Who are you? Nakagawa, from Tokyo Auto Market. Let me buy you one. Here. It pays 100,000. Insurance. A simple crash. Crash a car? It's simple. I did one just the other day. Interested? Payment is guaranteed immediately. Who'll guarantee my life? That depends on your driving. No way. - It's like a sport. - Still no. Just dent the front a little. How much do you make? 200,000. Twice as much. The owner makes 300,000. The one risking his life makes the least. Life's like that. Those with money profit most. No way. A cool 100 grand. Where? The rotary at Sendagaya. Hit the divider. An easy 100,000. #Your local shopping center is always cheaper. #Every purchase over 500 yen... #wins a ticket in our 100,000 yen draw. #Other prizes include electrical appliances and quality furniture. #Shop locally and win big. I pass. Okay then. It's on the counter. Wait. I'll do it. Don't complain later. How can I, if I'm dead? That's the spirit. Let's go. Pay me in advance. Afterwards, I promise. No, now. Okay. Give this to my dad. Where's Jiro gone? He's gone, to the rotary. Nakagawa. The salesman who's always here? What about Nakagawa? Gone to the rotary. To crash the car. Better get this car under cover. Listen. Jiro's in trouble. Jiro, no! Stop! He once told me the seaside in Kishu is beautiful. Who's the Real Killer? The End Subtitles by Stuart J Walton (Sprout)
