You think you're gonna rent this room, you can just go away. Listen, sister, as far as I'm concerned, you're not even here. Oh, is that so? Well, I'll show you whether I'm here or not. Um... Oh, how do you do? I'd like to see the room you have for rent. Don't pay any attention to her. I won't even look at it, I'll take it sight unseen. Here's my money in advance. Now would you please show me to my room? Oh, no, you don't. Here's my money. Now goodbye, young lady, it's been very nice meeting you. I'm certainly going to enjoy having you for a landlady. Well, I... Now I gave her my rent first. You wouldn't want a roomer like him. He's not even a gentleman. Why, if he were any kind of a gentleman he'd realize that ladies come first. You got something there, kid. But, Grandma, I've already paid my rent. You see that money? Mine. Oh, it can't be counterfeit. How about it? Well, I gave her my money first. And he snatched it back. Oh, Grandma, you know I wouldn't do a thing like that, don't you? Save that swoon tune for somebody your own age, son. Hey, where do you think you're going? My room I hope. That's someone else after this room. What do you mean "your room?" Oh! I've already rented it. You're mistaken, lady, I rented it. No, wait a minute, wait a minute. You wouldn't want that room anyway really. It hasn't even got a bath. I don't need a bath. Well, that's a matter of opinion. Whoa... Look out. Don't let 'em in. Move away, will you? I would... I know I'm the... How do you do? Is there something you want? I'll have the key to my room and a flyswatter. Listen, Flutesnoot, if you think you're gonna hornet... Hornet? What do you mean hornet? I rented this room an hour ago. An hour ago? I rented it two hours ago. Listen, I've been looking all day for a place to live and I want that room. I'm dead tired and I haven't any place else to go. I'm sorry folks but I'm the new tenant. May I show you to the door? Who's he? He's nobody. Goodbye, folks. Now just a minute, you're not gonna get that. Are you woofing? No, I'm not woofing. Hey, Grandma. She wants to dance to my crowd... Nobody invited your crowd. It's my party... Hey, that's the boy that rented me the room. I fixed up the attic as a rumpus room, didn't I? I got just as much right to have a party there as you have. Now, children... Hey, that's the girl that rented me the room. Buzz is gonna spoil everything, Aunt Stella. He wants to play kissing games and that's so babyfied. My crowd... Your crowd kisses all the time. They don't bother about playing games. They do not! They do too. All you do is shmoodle, shmoodle all the time. Mabel, you tell that gang of yours if they want to pitch woo, to go out on the front porch. Children, did you rent the room? Sure, I rented out to that guy. Ah, you see. You wacky, I rented it to that dame. You see? Why didn't you ask permission before you went ahead with a thing like that? Since when do you have to ask permission around here? Now wait a minute, I'm starting to work in the morning, and I've got to have that room. I'm so tired I can't walk another step. Oh, you're breaking my heart, but if you'll excuse me, I'm going to get some rest. Hey, nobody's gonna kick my renter her out of here. He gets it. Hey, now, look. I made a bonafide deal with that dame and she's gonna get it. Look, will you please make up your mind? I gotta go to work on a graveyard shift. Listen, Bob, I just finished eight hours of juggling a rivet gun and I'm in no mood to wheedle. If anybody's sleeping in that room tonight, it's me. Now, wait a minute... What do you think we should do, Mother? Well, they can't all have the room. There comes that piano again. Look out for that door, Jim. That's it. Where do you want it lady, the usual place? Yes, right against the wall. Now what? Oh, that's Aunt Stella's. She brings it home every time she leaves her husband. She just left him again. That instrument's got more mileage on it than a model team. So what? See, I'd like to... I want that room. I gotta some sleep and go to work. I got an idea. The guys work on a night shift and the girls work on a day shift, so why couldn't y'all... Yes, why couldn't they all rent the room. Oh, Grandma, that ain't nice. I know, it isn't even decent. Well, what's wrong with it? The girl will sleep there at night and the boys sleep there in the daytime. Well, I guess it'll be all right, then. I'm certainly glad he approves. Gee, I think it would work out all right. They wouldn't even have to see each other. That's one thing in its favor. Grandma, that sounds like a very intriguing arrangement. Oh, I wouldn't do that for anything. I'll have this empty in a minute. Oh, that'll be fine. Ah, gents? Isn't that a slight overstatement? I hope someday there'll be another room for rent in this town. And I hope you're the lucky little girl that finds it. Honey child, there just ain't another room for rent in town. I've been looking all week for a place to live. Too bad they couldn't dig you one. Ow. Take it easy, will you? Well, watch it. Sorry. Come on, let's go out and get something to eat. Something with a dash of poison in it, I hope. No. Not yet. If we can do anything for you, just holler. With all that noise going on downstairs, you'll never hear me. Ah, that's just the piano tuner. You'll get used to him. Every time the piano's moved, it has to be tuned. How often is that? Every time Aunt Stella leaves Uncle Clem. Every time? You mean it's a habit? Well, we counted 14 times last year then we stopped counting. Too bad she doesn't play a harmonica. Who's that? My fiancee. Oh, isn't he a little old for you? He's only 35. I've seen him someplace. He's the personnel director at the factory, Wayne Calhoun. Oh, that's where I've seen him. When are you two gonna get married? Oh, I don't know. Things are so unsettled now and well, besides, I think every girl should do what she can to help win this war. I don't know how I'm gonna explain to him about this room. Wayne has some very definite ideas. Oh, tell him you found a nice place with good plumbing, only a couple of drips in it. Even the thought of this setup makes me shudder. I wouldn't worry about it. What he doesn't know won't hurt him. Oh, boy! Bed feels good, you know? This is heaven, such comfort. Quiet too. What's that? Do you think it's gonna cave in now, or do you give it five minutes? I don't know but the OPA won't let us keep this room without a ceiling on it. I can't understand how they allow kids to stay up so late. When I was their age, I had to be in bed by 3:00 a.m. Well, I don't know about you but I'm gonna try to get to sleep. Can you hear anything? Not a thing. The idea is not to spray all in one place. Spread it all over evenly. Do you think you get it now, Miss Warren? Well, almost, only what I don't understand... I'll go over it again, Miss Warren. I'll try to make it very, very simple. Now you understand this is a pressure pot, this is the hose, this is where the paint comes out. The paint is called primer and the idea is to spray it evenly over these airplane parts. This is an airplane part. I think I get it now. Well, fine then, you take the gun and start spraying. Like this? Exactly like that. No, no, get it even! Not all at one... Uh... Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. Miss Warren. Well, you said not all in one place. I think possibly you might be more valuable in some other department, Miss Warren. Will you come with me, please? Yes, sir. Boy, I'll be glad when this day is over. I can hardly keep my eyes open. One nice thing about this department, you can't fall asleep on the job. If those kids start another part tonight... Miss Warren, you're wanted in the personnel office right away. The personnel office? Oh, Wayne must want to see me. You know, when most people get called at the personnel department, it's... When you get called, it's... Shmoodle, shmoodle. Hello, Wayne. Well, Rosalyn, my dear, how's the new job going? Oh, it's just swell. I think I'm really going to like it when I catch on to the work a little better. You're... you're sure this is what you want, Roslin? Oh, of course, Wayne. Why shouldn't I do something? I think it's every woman's duty to do what she can to help, don't you? Oh, yeah. Yes, of course. There's only one thing, Rosalin. You know, this plant is in line for an Army "E". Your report shows that you were 10 minutes tardy this morning. Now, you know how I'd feel if a fiancee of mine were responsible for losing that E. Of course I know how you feel, Wayne. And I'm terribly sorry. It won't happen again. You see, I haven't been getting much sleep lately. In a new place and everything. Well, naturally. I didn't mean to scold you. Tell me about the place you live in, is it nice? Oh, it's lovely, Wayne. We have such nice plumbing, only a couple of... We can see the park from our window. What do you mean "we?" "Our window?" Well, I couldn't get a place alone, the town being so crowded and everything. I rather expected that. Well, I hope she's a nice girl, Rosalin. One has to be careful with so many people pouring in from everywhere. You'll have to watch your respectability, you know? Yes. Tell me, what's your roommate's name? Charlie. Charlie? Charles, Miss Charles. She's very nice. I hope to meet her at the first opportunity. Yes, yes, of course. Well, I must get back to work. I'll call for you for dinner at seven o'clock, my dear. Oh, that would be wonderful, Wayne. I'll be ready. Till 7:00 then. Bye. Bye. Why, it's dark in here? Those eggs have left the blinds down. They're gonna make a couple of crummy roommates if you ask me. Well, how do you like that? They've taken Wayne's picture away. And put up a picture of one of their own girls. She looks like she wears a toupee. I'll bet they've taken some of our drawer space too. I don't trust them, especially that Charlie. Yeah, he looks like a smug plug with a pug mug. You think he might make a pass at us? I wouldn't be surprised. I didn't like him the first time I saw him. I wonder if that is one of his girls. If it is, she's old enough to be his mother. As a matter of fact, it is my mother. I tried to shut you up. How dare you still be in this room? You know we get off our shift at 03:30. And as for making a pass at you, you don't tempt me, sweetheart. Well, you tempt me in a homicidal sort of way. Now, look here, you guys. Our deal was that you were to sleep while we were working and we were supposed to sleep while you're working. You have a homestead at this place, you know? Did it ever occur to you that there are more hours in the day than the eight hours you work and the eight hours we work? If you think it over, gorgeous, you will remember there are an additional eight hours in the 24. We would get in with a couple of mathematicians. What are you going to do about those hours? We're not going to do anything about them. You're gonna do something about them. You're gonna get out of this room, that's what you're gonna do. Oh, you'll have to pick me out of this bed and dress me first. Okay, brother, you asked for it. Oh, now just a minute. I might forget myself. Forget yourself? What a happy case of amnesia that would be. Well, it's obvious that the four of us can't stay together in this room eight hours a day. We've got to compromise. Vera and I will have it for four hours and you can have it the other four hours. Okay, we accept your proposition. Oh, no, you don't! This is Rosie's and my four hours. It is not. It is Kelly's and my four hours! It is not! It is too, now, come on. Come in! Hello, everybody. Hello. Can I use your phone? Why certainly, go right ahead. What's one more person in this room? I use the one downstairs, only Grandma always makes cracks about what I say. I'm liable to make a crack or two myself. Look, I've got a date in a few minutes and I'd like to change my clothes if you don't mind. Oh, I don't mind. That'd be kind of fun. Hello, is this Hugh Harvey? This is Mabel. Listen, about our date tonight, a little something has come up. You see I had this previous date, only I thought it was for tomorrow night. Well, it turns out it's for tonight and on account of I'd had it for a whole week, I think this other guy ought to get priority. I know but I was just thinking that I could change my date with you to tomorrow night. Would that be all right? What does he say? I can't wait. He says it's all right. All right then, Harvey, then I'll see you tomorrow. So long. That was such an interesting conversation, I could hardly keep my eyes open. I gotta make another call. Another call? Go right ahead, don't let us bother you. Oh, you won't bother me. Hello, is Fred there? Oh, this is Fred. For goodness sakes, I didn't recognize your voice. He's probably changing. Well, this is Mabel. Listen, about that date I have with you tomorrow night, a little something has come up. You see I had this kind of tentative date before, only I wasn't absolutely sure it was gonna crash through, only it just did and I was wondering if I could change my date with you for tomorrow night until the night after? If you keep this up, you'll be busy all week. But gee, Fred, you know I'd rather go out with you than anybody, but on account of this other guy inviting me first, I think he has priority. Must be rationing dates now. Well, gee, Fred, I think you could co-operate. After all this other guy's practically a soldier and I think you could think about your country just a little bit. Yes, he's gonna enlist just as soon as he finishes high school. He's only got two years to go. He's practically MacArthur's buddy right now. Well, if you are very patriotic, Fred Misrock, you make your date with me the night after tomorrow instead of tomorrow night. Hi, everybody. I'm gonna fix your wardrobe. Make it bigger so you can store more stuff in it. You couldn't make it big enough to store a couple of dead bodies, could you? Male bodies. Huh? Well, all right, if that's the way you feel, Fred Misrock, break my date with you completely. And all I've got to say is that I wouldn't even go out with a man as unpatriotic as you. Oh, boy, that conversation was super. That was even more interesting than the last one. I could hardly keep my ears off of you. Who you gonna call now? Bert Felzenhauser. Bert Felzenhauser. Well, what do you know? He'll be happy to hear from you. Come right in and bring your friends with you. Well, I haven't any friends with me. I'm all alone. Oh, that's too bad, we were getting a little lonesome in here. Well, I just wondered if you'd mind if I'd use the long mirror. It's the only long mirror in the house and I'm making this dress, I just have to see myself all over. Oh, that's quite all right, go right ahead. Thank you. Well, I'm fine too. The reason I called is remember last week when you asked me for a date for this week and I said I didn't know how I was gonna work you in? Well, something has just come up and I think I can work you in the night after tomorrow night. Well, why don't you girls come and say if this hem is straight. It's a little long on the side. Well, maybe you can switch your date with Helen Bowers from the night after tomorrow night to some other night. Do come in. Uh, excuse me, I wanted to set around some of these zip traps. I heard a mouse last night. So that's what that noise was. Yeah, they're pesky things. Stay right where you are, young man. Where else would I go? Well, if you don't make a date with me for the night after tomorrow night, I might not be able to work you in again for another week or two. Certainly hope she works him in. Come in! Hello, Stella. That's Uncle Clem, that's Stella's husband. Hiya, Clem. The one she left. Gee, how could she ever bring herself to leave him. Oh, Stella, darling, I've got to have a few words with you. I've had enough words with you Clem Prouty. I said what I had to say when I left you and you have no right to come to my mother's house. Oh, now Stella darling, you don't know what I've been through the last few days. Oh, now honeybunch. Dumpling. Huh? I don't think Helen would consider it standing her up. You could just say that you had this kind of a tentative date already and then switch it to some other night. Somebody answer the door. Oh, gosh, it's probably Wayne. Oh. Hey! ♪ Be it ever so humble ♪ There's no place like home ♪ ♪ When the stars ♪ Come out in the evening ♪ I ask ♪ Every star above ♪ Tell me why ♪ Can't I sing a love song ♪ Can it be because I've never been ♪ In love? ♪ Why?

Yes, Wayne, it was, it was a very good dinner. I thought that carrot salad was particularly delicious. Yes, Wayne, the carrot salad was awfully good. Wasn't it carrots you told me contain so much vitamin B or something? Vitamin A. Oh, yes, vitamin A. One of our most important health vitamins. And in these strenuous times, one must watch one's health more carefully than ordinarily. Well, I suppose I should be getting you home. Oh, but it's early, it's only 11 o'clock. Don't forget, we have a big day ahead of us tomorrow. We mustn't be late for work again, must we? Oh, no, we mustn't do that. Besides when I get you home, I have a surprise for you. A surprise? Mm-hmm. You're gonna kiss me. Oh, no, it isn't that. Well, it would be quite a surprise. Oh, that young lady sharing your room? Uh-huh. I'd like very much to meet her. OF course. Hello. Vera, this is Wayne Calhoun. Hi. Very happy to know you, Miss Charles. Miss Charles? We're so accustomed to calling each other by our first names. Nobody ever calls her anything but Vera. Sounds strange to have somebody call you Miss Charles. It sure does. Oh, Wayne, I can hardly wait. Is that the surprise? Oh, yes. I thought it might brighten your room, it's a... it's a very excellent copy of a Nusbacher. A Nusbacher, my favorite flower. Nusbacher is the painter, Miss Charles. That's beautiful, Wayne. I thought you'd like it. It's... It's to well compensate you in a way for my absence. Your absence? Yes, I have to go to Washington for a couple of weeks. Oh. I hate it break the news to you. Does it make you feel dreadful? Just dreadful. Well, suppose I hang the picture and have a look at your room at the same time. Well, I... I... It's not very tidy up there. Oh, that's all right. Do you mean there's... A lot of things hanging around. Well, I understand that girls who live in a room have to do their own laundry. Oh, Wayne, couldn't we make it some other time? There'll be undies scattered around and... Oh, don't be so modest here. After all, we're engaged. There's nothing up there that could shock me. Wanna bet? Wayne, I can hang the picture myself. Hanging a picture is a man's work. Well, I'll, uh, I'll dash on up and get some of the things out of the room. Very modest girl your friend. Yes, isn't she? Very respectable. Hey, knock, why don't you when entering a gentleman's boudoir. You gotta get out of here. Why? Wayne's coming. So what, it's our four hours, isn't it? You want to ruin Rosie's romance? I don't mind. What do you think it's all right now? Well, what goes on here? Oh, we're just pitching a little woo. Well, Mabel, that's not a very nice thing to do when there are other people around. Oh, you won't bother us. You want us to move over, there's plenty of room for you. No, thank you. Who is that girl? Oh, she's the landlady's granddaughter. Well, really, Rosalind, I don't think she's a very good influence on you. Oh, Wayne, she's only 16, she doesn't eat a thing by what she's doing. This is a very respectable household. Now, maybe so but I... Hi. Hello. Hi. Who's that? Well, that was grandma. She's really an old dear, very respectable. Yeah but that... that feather hicamadoo. Oh, it was one of Vera's. Vera gave it to her. It just looks a little eccentric on Grandma, that's all. I guess it is a little young for her. Oh, now, daring, listen to me. Don't argue with me. Oh, please, darling. I simply won't live in the same house as you, Clem Prouty. But, dumpling. Hello. Dumpling, we've lived in the same house together off and on for years. Well, I'm through now. Look at you with your suspenders always showing. But sweety... And you've been nipping bourbon again. Oh, darling, at these prices, who can nip bourbon? Now, be logical, honey. What sort of people live in this place? Oh, that was just Mr. and Mrs. Prouty. They're really a very respectable married couple. They just talk that way, that's all. Really, I'm beginning to worry about you. This place doesn't seem at all nice and quiet and reputable as you said. I'm not blaming you, Rosie, but you may have gotten yourself innocently into a nest of very strange people. They... Ouch! Buzz! What are you doing? I'm a G-man. I'm just tracking down a gang of crooks. I think they're mixed up in a spy ring. Come on. Oh! Get in there. Come on. Hold on, please, there. Imagine meeting you here. Rather nice room. Very nice. Picture might look well right here. No. No, I think the light's better on that wall. You have a cold. Yes, it must be the sea air. Let's do something for it perhaps, uh, What, something's burning in there. Uh... uh, you mustn't go in there, we're... we will be fumigating... moths! Wayne, really, I must get to bed. Thank you so much, but I have a very busy day ahead of me tomorrow. And I'll hang the picture in the morning. I'm terribly tired, I'm sorry dear. I hope you have a nice trip, Wayne. You know, I don't like this house. I think there's somebody funny acting people around here. I'm sorry you're going away. Business before pleasure, you know. Well, goodbye, my dear. I'm going to miss you terribly. Goodbye, dear. Yes, of course. Bye. Ain't love grand? You know, that picture just looks like Wayne. Yeah, especially around the pot. Come in. Oh-oh, Alexandria Graham Bell. Can I use your phone? So early in the morning? Oh, I'm in an awful mess. I've got three dates for tomorrow night not one for tonight. What would happen if you went through a whole evening dateless? That shouldn't happen to a dog. Hello, Eddie. This is Mabel. I can't help it if I woke you up. Listen, Eddie, something absolutely vital is coming up. Let's get out of here before it comes up. Well, you know, when you called me for a date tomorrow night, and I said I could just squeeze you in between eight and ten? Well, I now find that I can give you the whole evening tonight. What, couldn't you switch your date with Jessica tonight for tomorrow night? Oh-oh. Here come our roommates. Bless their little hearts. Well, good mornin', ladies. Good mornin'. Ah, how do you do? How do you do? Did you sleep well last night? We did not. We caught Grandma's mouse in the middle of the night. My, you girls certainly do look nice when you get up in the morning. Well, thank you. This is fresh and crisp as a wet corn flake. Every other inch a gentlemen. Thinks nothing of it. Anything he says to me goes right in one nostril and out the other. On her stuff. We've got to find another room. That would be nice. There must be a place somewhere in this town. Hello, girls. Good morning. Good morning. Gee, this is a nice room. My, what big windows you have, Grandma. You have that, on a clear day you can see. I bet that bed is really comfortable, huh? My daughter Stella likes it, this is her room, you know, when she's here. Which is most of the time. Uh, do you think she'll stay this time, Grandma? Maybe her separation from her husband is only a temporary thing. It looks like it's permanent this time, dag blast it. That's a shame. I always hate to see a couple split up. You know, sometimes, the thing like that can ruin women's lives. Yes, especially ours. Uh, maybe if your daughter and Clem, Mr. Prouty, sort of talk things over. That's right, Grandma. When two people have lived together for a long time, it's a terrible tragedy. Don't give me the works. I'm not the flibbertigibbet that's left her husband. Uh, Ms. Quill, what do you think is the real basic reason that Mr. and Mrs. Prouty don't get along? Well, I'll tell you. Stella's kind of hard to please. She expects Clem to make a living. Old-fashioned girl, huh? And if you sat down and figured how much Clem has made in the last 20 years, you might arrive at the good round sum of $ 1.98. Oh, that's too bad. Yep. And how many years could you live on $1.98? Well, girls, go on down to the kitchen, and find some coffee on the back end of the stove. Run along. Thanks. We might take you up on that. I didn't doubt it for a second. You know, if there was some way we could get those two lovebirds together we could have that room. Good morning, my love. What do you want, Clem Prouty? Oh, now, sweetheart, don't speak sharply because I have news for you. Grand news. You're gazing upon a man of business. You mean you've got a job? A job? I'm the proprietor of my own establishment. What are you talking about, Clem Prouty? Stella, my love, it's true. Your erstwhile worthless husband is a success at last. Saturday, I open my own emporium. It's a neat, though unpretentious, little eating place directly opposite the factory. You are not just telling me this, Clem Prouty, to get me to come back to you, or you? You know I left you before because you lied to me. Oh, Stella, you had every right to leave me. I'd been a worthless scoundrel. Oh, yes, I have. But it's all changed, darling. Because I've suddenly come to the realization that nothing matters but your happiness. And that's inspired me, and it's fired me with ambition. Oh, Clem. Yeah. Now, you will come back to me, won't you? - Of course, Clem. - Oh, dumpling. Now, of course, dear, there's one little thing. Naturally, a business venture like this will require a small amount of capital. Oh, only $200. And... So! Now, Stella, my love... Don't you "my love" me! I might have known you had something up your sleeve. Oh, now, darling, you hurt me deeply when you... Don't you speak to me again, Clem Prouty, until you can stand on your own two feet. Oh, now, sweetheart, you don't realize... You can't understand what... Ain't that just like a woman? First time in my life, I've had a proposition that would make me thousands, and she turns me down for a paltry 200. "Paltry" he says. Well, I could pay her back double and triple. Ten times the amount in a week. In a week? In less than a week. Hmm. Hey, come on in. Hey! Everything... Come on. Hello, hello. Everything's on the house today. Absolutely free. There you go. Hello. Well... Everything's on the house. Say, if that keeps up, you'll never get your 200 bucks back. He said it was just because it was opening day. I'm beginning to wonder how that guy ever made a profit of a $1.98. You sure Grandma didn't mean a deficit? Could be. Oh, hi, Charlie. Hi. What's with you? Oh, nothing, just looking for a date for tonight. No, I'm sorry. I'm busy. But who's asking you? Look, honey child, I got the whole town to choose from. See this little book? It's just full of numbers, and not one of them is yours. Hmm, all glamor girls, no doubt.Naturally.

Listen, it just so happens that she broke her leg. Did they have to shoot her? Listen, lady, there are plenty of dames in this town that are just dying to go riding with me. I can just see them waiting by the telephone with their tongues hanging out. - Really? You know, I'm beginning to feel a little sorry for you. If things get any tougher, I'm gonna have to go out with you myself. I'm just gonna take you up on that. Me? Oh, come now, I'm not a glamor girl, or a burlesque queen, or... All right, come on if you're going. I'm just doing this to save time. And nickels. And remember, I'm only doing this out of pity for you.

Uh, you didn't by any chance arrange this? No, I haven't that much influence. I thought maybe you might have been taking lessons from some of Mabel's boyfriends. I wish I were Herman Schulzenfeld. Which one is he? He's the one that she lets kiss her. Mmm. You wanna kiss Mabel? No, I... I figured that if I were her Manchulsenfeld, maybe you'd be Mabel. You wanna kiss me? Well, only if I were her Manchulsenfeld, you and me. But we're not. You know, I was just thinking if I were her Manchulsenfeld, I would do this. You would? Mmm-hmm. And I would do this. Then I'd... Here. Hold that. Then I'd do this. And then I'd... Uh, but you're not her Manchulsenfeld, and I'm not Mabel. Hey, they're closing up the park! I guess we ran out of gas after all. Hey! Hey, down there... Ooh! No! Don't! Help! Hey! Ah, you girls are being moved out. The pleasure is all ours. Oh, I'm not so sure. It gives a man a sort of a confident feeling to know there aren't any women in this room. Hey, lug, be careful with those things! You'll get it all wrinkled. That's the dress I have to wear to the theater tonight. It's pretty. It sure is gonna be lonesome without you girls in there. Oh, we're gonna miss you too, Kelly. I don't know what we're gonna do without you, but it'll be a lot of fun trying. Not bad, huh? Oh, it's swell. Hey, you don't wanna forget this. I knew you couldn't live without it. Besides that, I couldn't live with it. Oh, thank you so much. Would you hang it on that nail over there, please? Sure. Oh, say, the recreational director over at the plant heard you singing at the juke joint, and he wants to know if you'll be in the show he's putting on tomorrow. Are you kidding? No, I'm not kidding. A lot of big shots will be there. The plant's being awarded an E, and if you're interested, you better get over and see Mr. Underwood. Oh, I should say I will. Hey, Rosie, here's a telegram that came for you this afternoon. Thank you, Buzz. Anything that I can get a bang out of? - It's from Wayne. - Ah, booey. I thought it was gonna be something interesting. That guy couldn't even say anything interesting, even in a telegram. He'll be home in the morning. Oh, what a let-down. I thought he was gonna stay two weeks. He must've finished his business sooner than he expected. You don't seem very happy about it. Of course, I'm happy about it. I'm thrilled. Are you? Why certainly. What do you expect me to do? Turn cartwheels? Well, if I were coming home to the girl I loved, she'd be turning cartwheels. Hmm. Hey. Look at this. I wonder why she did that. I didn't know the poor kid was that broke. What do think your fiance's gonna say when he finds out you haven't got the ring? I don't know. If he even suspected I pawned it, he'd die. Gee, I wish I had 200 bucks to lend you. Thanks anyway, Vera. I'll think of something. Did you give it to her? No, I've got a better idea. How much money you got, Kelly? Oh, about 30 bucks. Yeah, same here. Ever since I've been trying to get in the Marines, I've been sending all my dough home to Mom. Figured I wouldn't need it. But now, - Rosie, I wish there was some way... - Yeah. Hey, wait a minute. You know that Joe Allen still owes me ten from that poker game the other night. Maybe I could collect. Poker game! I know how we can get 200 bucks. The boys. You know, I'm getting sick of looking at this thing. I don't mind. I can play it now. I practice ten minutes every time we move it. Hey, that's some idea. Can you play boogie-woogie? Of course not. Only the classics. Like... Well, if they want it moved again, they can move it themselves. I'm out. Bit of blue. I'll see it. Me, too. Me, too. Norman, what have you got? Three bullets. Three sixes. Three fives. Ah, gee, three Jacks. King, full. You're sure lucky tonight, Charlie. Oh, there's nothing to it, boys. Just take all these. Get these out of your way so you won't clutter up the table. Do you hear what I hear? Oh, no. It can't be. Oh, it can't be. But I guess it is. Back and forth. Back and forth. Who do you think you are? A street guard? Someday, you're gonna wear out your piano. I've made up my mind. This time, it's final. You know, it's a funny coincidence. Every time I have a date with Herman Schulzenfeld, Aunt Stella comes home. I'd advise you to get rid of that Herman Schulzenfeld right now. Well, girls, it looks as though you're out again. But we just got settled in here. Mrs. Prouty, couldn't you find some other place to go? Me? How ridiculous. This is my home. This is my mother's house. Yes, and she's been running in and out of it every hour, on the hour, just like a cuckoo clock. And another thing. Every time I have a date with Fatso Pinkerton, Aunt Stella moves out. Would it be asking too much to break your date with Herman Schulzenfeld, and call up Fatso Pinkerton right away? Maybe you can stand this moving in and out, but every time I look at Aunt Stella's piano, it looks more exhausted. By now it's practically droopy. Er, Mrs. Prouty, maybe if you called your husband and told him you were sorry... But I'm not sorry. Oh. It's no use, girls. This has been going on for 20 years. Oh, my goodness. Look at that. Oh, now I have to wear my best dress tonight after all. Oh! Well, where do you think you're going? Well, I thought that you were out. What she means is we're moving into this room. By jolly. How cozy. Oh, this thing is all a mistake, fellas. Why, we don't even know these girls, do we, Kelly? Well, they do look a little familiar but I don't exactly recognize 'em. Look, this isn't funny. We're moving back into this room. Oh, they're moving back into the room. Oh, don't pay any attention to these girls, fellas. They're just trying to make a sap out of me. They're only kidding, see? We are not kidding. Oh, Charlie, we wuv you. Oh, now, fellas. Wait a minute. Would everybody please mind just going away, so that Vera and I could settle down? Now, Charlie, I think you're gonna have to get tough. Now, look, are you gonna go quietly, or do we have to throw you out? I'm afraid you'll have to throw us out. Well, we can do that, too. Let's get going. Hey! Hey! You can't do that! Get your hands off me, you old rat! Oh, you... Charlie! You mongoose! You... You... Flute snoot. You're out, now stay out. Oh, we'll get even with you, if it's the last thing we ever do. That's as much our room as it is yours. Oh, no. You two moved out. Yes, but we're moving in again. That's what you think. Goodbye, babe. Oh... Now what are we gonna do? We're gonna get those guys out of there if we have to blast. Come on. Ninth Precinct. Sergeant Mulvaney. Oh, gambling? Yes, Officer. Every week, it's the same thing. My husband loses all his wages. And there isn't even any food in the house for the children. We'll take care of it, lady. Now, what's that address? All over for two. I'll up you four. Have a four? A lot of us have few of four. Really? Hey, look at this. All right, stay where you are. Hey, what's the idea? All right, all right. Get your hats and line up over there. Get the evidence, Brian. Why, this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of. Stop talking and get your coats on. Oh... Well, I'm certainly disappointed in you boys. I certainly am. Well, I'm sorry if we've caused you any trouble, Grandma. Trouble hag. What makes me mad is to think there was a poker game going on in the house and you didn't ask me to play. All right, come on. Outside. Keep on going. I wonder who tipped off the cops. Don't tell me. Let me guess. Why? What's the matter? Come on, get going. Gambling? Isn't that awful? You wouldn't want men like that living in your house, Mrs. Quill. No, they'll give the place a bad name. Mighty smooth work. We'd better go, Vera. We'll be late for the theater. Yeah. Nice. And I'll have no gambling in this precinct. Besides, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Squandering your money like that, particularly the one of you that's got a wife and kids that's going hungry. Oh, I get it. I had a hunch she was the stool pigeon. Oh, so it's you, is it? Well, I'm gonna make an example of you, so maybe, in the future, you won't be neglecting your family. Bail will be $25 each. Twenty-five? Oh, but Sergeant. I said $25 each. And those of you that can't pay it gets locked up. Now, the clerk will take your money. And as for you, if you're ever brought in here again for abusing your wife, you'll go to jail. Oh, but Sergeant... Go on with you now! That's great. That's something. It's funny the game is fixed just when Charlie's a big winner. Oh, yeah. I suppose you think this was my idea. If I'd known the show was gonna be that terrible, I'd have stayed home. If we have a home. You don't suppose they'll send the boys to jail, do you? That was the idea. Hey, look at that rain. I can't see a thing. You better slow down. Here's the house. Gosh, it's raining harder than ever now. How are we gonna get in the house? I certainly don't want to ruin the only dress I've got. Me, too. We'd get soaked just running to the front door. What are we gonna do? We can't stay out here all night. I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna take this thing off and leave it in the car. You mean to make a dash for the front door in our undies? Well, the rain won't hurt them, and I'm certainly not gonna ruin this dress. Suppose somebody sees us? Who'd be out in all this rain, anyway? It's nearly midnight. Okay. Where are the keys? Oh, right here in my pocket. Oh, darn it. I left them in the car. Hey, wait for me. I'm not gonna stay here all alone. Oh! Locked from the inside! Oh! Oh, so is this one. Now I suppose we'll have to ring the doorbell and wake up everybody in the house. Like this? Well? Give me a hairpin. Here, I'll see if I can find a window unlocked The windows are all locked. Oh! Oh! Wait a minute! Hey, what is this? Go away! Can't you see I'm not dressed? I'm too much of a gentleman to look. What do you think you're doing out here? I'm trying to get into the house, I live here. Oh, you live here? Come on, we'll find out about that. Oh! You know this woman? Why, I don't know. It's kind of dark out here. I better have another look. Oh, come on! You know me. Speak up. You recognize her voice, Charlie? No. Neither do I. Oh, wait a minute I think I... Well. I think I... No, I don't. You tell 'em, Joe. You tell 'em. Well, the face is a little familiar but uh... No, I've never seen her before in my life. Oh! She said she lives here. Oh, that must be some mistake. You better come down to station. Oh Charlie, Jordan, how could you do such a thing? I'm sorry, Lady. I don't know what you're talking about. Did you know this man? Know him... Why... He's my husband. What? Yes. And he chased me out of the house, Officer. He chased me out like this... And I haven't done a thing. Why you... No, you hadn't done much. We just had our poker game pinched. Oh, one of those things, eh? Yeah. Well, you got to come along too, young fellow. Oh... Wait a minute, Officer. She's not my wife! She's... Come on, both of you. Hey, this whole thing's a frame-up. I got to get to work Is this trip really necessary? I got 'em. I got the keys. Ow! What the... Good night. We picked this woman outside. She was running around in the rain without any clothes on hardly. She says her husband here chased her out of the house. Oh, so it's you again? Uh, yes sir. Look, Sergeant... I Young Lady, what's your name? Rosie. Mrs. Charlie Doran. It is not. I'm not his wife. Wait a minute. Didn't you tell us back there, this man was your husband? She's a little nervous, Sergeant. Any shenanigans here, you both got to jail. Madam, what were you doing, running around in the rain like that? Well, I was trying to get into the house. You were the one that kicked yourself about that poker game earlier this evening, I see. Well, you see. Uh... And that's why you threw her out of the house, isn't that right? Well... No. I didn't throw her out. I... I told you, if you brought in here again, things would be pretty tough with you, my fine young friend. This time, you're going to jail. Oh, but I don't want him to go to jail. He chased you out in the rain, you're not even clothed, You don't want him sent to jail? Well, you see, if he goes to jail, he'll lose his job. Besides, you don't want him to go to jail. Is that it? Well... Now look, this is no domestic relations court and I could lock you both up for disturbing the peace but we can't clutter up our courts with petty squabbles. Now, you could kiss and make up if you wanted to. I am willing, Sargent. I am not. Oh, come on. It's obvious you're in love with each other as you wouldn't be trying to keep him out of jail. Well, if you're gonna be stubborn about it, I could still lock you up. Now, which is it going to be? Well? Hold it! Hey! Wait a minute, you can't take our picture! Sorry, it's already been taken. Oh, you give me that film! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! You two better be running along now, before you get in bad humor again. Besides, that picture you can't... How would you know? Hey, wait a minute. What about my raincoat, hat and boots? Well, what am I gonna wear? Here, put mine on. And remember... No more fighting. We won't, Sergeant. The man said no more fighting. Then, you do care. Very well, Wayne. If that's the way you feel about it. How do you expect me to feel about it, Rosalind? After all, a man is intended to marry a girl. Perhaps, that was a mistake, too. I'll return your ring. Well, that's that. Well, that didn't take aspirin to get rid of that pain in the neck? Only, you haven't got the ring. Oh, I've got to get some money, someplace. Maybe Clem. Right! If we hurry, we can stop there before we go to work. Come on! OK. Look, Mr. and Mrs. That's a laugh. Slimy old wolf... Good Morning, Rosie. Would you like some coffee, girls? No, I-I-I've got to talk to you. Oh, sure. Sure. I got to have that $200. It's terribly important. Oh well, I can have it for you on Saturday. But I must have it now, this morning. Oh honey, that's pretty short notice. I mean on the account of opening and everything I had to put out all the receipts for the supplies. But couldn't you get it somehow, I've just got to have it, Clem. Well, I'd like to help you out, dear. But... Hello, Vera. Well Mr. Doran, you've a very weird sense of comedy. A little on the morbid side. Why, Vera. You can remove that phony innocence from that cherubic pan. You've undoubtedly read the morning papers. You must be very proud of yourself. I suppose you know that Rosie's engagement is broken up over this thing. No, I didn't. I wish I could help you Rosie, but... Excuse me. Rosie, I'm sorry. Is there anything I could do? I think you've already done about everything... that you can do. Honestly, I'm sorry. Have you really broken your engagement to Wayne? What difference would that make to you? None. None at all. Mr. Charlie Doran to see you, Mr. Callhoun. I'll not see him He said it was important. Sorry to barge in like this on you, but I had to do it. I ought to break your neck. I don't think that'll be very practical. But there is something practical you ought to do. Are you trying to give me advice? I mean, from you, I'm not very interested. I'd advise you to listen to my advice. Not that I care what happens to you. But I do care what happens to a certain Rosie Warren. I suppose you care what happened to her last night when you allowed your picture to be taken with her? All right, let's not waste words, I'm in a hurry. Now, what I came here to tell you is... that Rosie, through some mental quirk, no doubt, is in love with you. And I'm not going to stand by and see her all broken up. Go on. That whole business last night was a rip whether you believe it or not. Fact of the matter is, Rosie doesn't even like me. That's something in her favor. There are a lot of things in her favor Mr. Callhoun. Except as I said, I don't like her taste in men. Unless you're the complete dope I think you are, you'll try and patch things up. That's all I got to say, Good-bye, Mr. Callhoun. You got your key? Oh, yes. My ring. Where did that come from? I don't know. Hey, Rosie. That man's here again. Oh-oh. Rigor mortis has just set in. You better make it snappy. We gotta get ready for that shindig at the plant, you know. Hello, Wayne. Hello, Rosalind. Can I speak to you for a moment? Why? Yes, I guess so. I haven't much time though. The celebration at the plant... Rosalind, when I spoke to you on the phone this morning I was very angry. But I've had a chance to cool down since then, and I realize now that... Realize what, Wayne? That you're not the kind of girl who could ever do anything unladylike or undignified. How do you know I couldn't? 'Cause I realize now that what I saw in the paper gave a completely wrong impression. How do you know that now? You didn't know it this morning. Well, I, uh, I spoke to this Charlie Doran. Charlie? You went to Charlie to convince yourself of my loyalty? Well, no, Rosalind, he came to me, he... What did he say, Wayne? Well, there's no need to go over all that, Rosalind. Isn't it enough that I love you, that I want to marry you and I'm still... That's very generous of you, Wayne. You're very understanding, but... Then you will... No. But why? Wayne, I appreciate everything you've done for me and I realize your interest in me is sincere, but... If it's because of the way I acted this morning, I... No, it isn't that. It's... Well, it's what I want in the person I marry, and you're just not what I want I guess. I'm afraid I don't understand you, Rosalind. No, I don't think you do, Wayne. And I don't think you ever will. Maybe that's why it would be better if we didn't marry. If you should change your mind, Rosalind... Of course, Wayne. And thank you. Kelly, I wanted to ask you if you were coming to the celebration at the plant. Sure, I'm coming. You know, I was just gonna look for you. Before Charlie left, he asked me to give you this. Before he left? Sure. He's checked out and gone. Hadn't you heard? Well, I'll be seeing you at the plant. Yeah. So long, Mrs. Prouty. Say, we better get dressed if we... From Charlie? He's gone away? Oh. So what? There're plenty of men in the world. Well, he's kinda cute. What the heck? No man is worth feeling terrible over. Or is he? I mean, I wouldn't let it throw me. I don't think. Of course, Charlie was different. He kinda made you feel better when he was around. When he said something, it meant something to you. When he... He was nice. He... Oh, Vera. Oh, Rosie. It's terrible. My friends and associates, I have the honor to present Senator J. W. Jones. Thank you. I wish that I might give you that much applause. For it is through your untiring efforts that our men at the battlefronts receive that equipment so necessary to victory. My hat is off to you. And now, it is my privilege to present General Thomas J. Dwight of the United States army. Thank you, Senator. Mr. Campbell, on behalf of the United States army, it is my pleasure to present to this plant of Campbell aircraft and its loyal employees this award of merit. An E for excellence. Now that you're all in such good humor, we're going to fill out the rest of our recreation period with a little entertainment.
