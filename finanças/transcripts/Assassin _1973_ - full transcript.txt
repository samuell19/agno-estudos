That's enough! Those bastards! Can I get you a pillow, sir? No. - Stewardess? - Yes, sir? Large brandy and soda, please. - Certainly, sir. With ice? - No, thank you. Nuclear fallout covering two-thirds of the continent can be expected from a megaton blast of this intensity. The red-shaded areas cover approximately 500 square miles north of the Mongolian border. Ladies and gentlemen, we shall be landing at Heathrow Airport, London. Please fasten your safety belts, and extinguish all cigarettes. Captain James and his crew thank you for travelling with us. We hope you have enjoyed your flight. Our arrival time will be 20:30 hours Greenwich Mean Time. The weather in London is misty. Mesdames et messieurs, nous arriverons a Heathrow Londres dans quelques minutes... Yes? - Control, this is Hamish. - Yes. I've got a job for your department, my dear. Yes? It concerns those leakages from the Air Ministry. I see. Have you discovered the identity of the...? Yes, it's a senior official. John Stacy, you know the fellow. - Used to be in the Ministry of Defence. - I see. What do you want done? It's a liquidation job. I want the best. Where? At a wedding reception. He's best man. - When? - Tomorrow afternoon. If it's convenient. Well, I can't possibly organise an "accident” in that space of time. - I'd have to... - It doesn't want to look like an accident. - We wish to place the blame. - I understand. - This one is vitally important. - Yes, I'll give it top priority, sir. - Yes, I thought you would. - Goodbye. - Jan? - Yes, sir? Bring in the 'A' file, and ask Matthew and Luke to come in. I have it on reliable authority that you're a right little raver. Matthew has only just returned, sir. - Well, tell him to wipe his feet. - Charming. Thank you, Jan. Thank you. How did it go, Matthew? Thought you'd never ask. Beautiful. - No-one saw you? - Nah. Not even the geezer I done. Obviously. - Is something on, sir? - Outside job. Well, do we get to do it? Missing the scent of blood already, Matthew? No. Just like doin' what I'm good at, don't I? Then keep your mouth shut. - When's it to be, sir? - Tomorrow. Well, who is gonna do it, then? ...debate this afternoon, the Prime Minister again emphasised the Government's determination not to waver on this question. Another troubled night in Ulster, when a bomb went off outside a public... ...closing time. Twelve people were injured, one critically. ...killing a child aged six, and injuring her mother. Thank you. Thank you, madam. Thank you. - What brings you to London? - Business. - What kind? - Mine. Thank you, sir. Arrival 20:45. No trouble. Out. Excuse me, sir? - You know what your allowances are? - Yes. Is there anything you wish to declare in excess of these allowances, sir? - No. - Open your cases, please. That one. Not much there. I didn't know it had to be full. - Mathematician? - Systems engineer. I never got past geometry. Too many angles. There always are. Well, enjoy your stay in London. Thank you. "The Air Ministry feel that "these figures of altitude and velocity "are open to interpretation, "and that a fuller review of the material... "should be given before publication." Aren't you coming, John? - It's nine o'clock. - In a minute. - Come on! - Set one up for me. Well, they're half-pissed already. "I feel that... that..." "A fuller review of the material..." "...should be given before publication." "I would appreciate a decision on this by return. "Yours, for and on behalf of..." You know the rest. Will that be all for tonight, Mr Stacy? Yes, thank you. It's Mr Craig's last night of freedom tonight, isn't it? What? Mr Craig's last night as a free man. Oh. Yes, yes. Is anything wrong, sir? No, no. Just tired. Well, good night. Good night. - I am expected. - Oh yes, of course, sir. Er... If you'd care to sign? We'll fill in the details later. All right. Oh, a suitcase arrived for you, and was put in your room. Thank you. Oh, and this letter was also left for you, sir. Thank you. 107. Thank you, sir. Thank you. ...nice pair of knockers. John's not interested in that kind of thing! Don't you believe it, mate. Hello, little darling. Would you like a drink? You'd give her your drink, wouldn't you, Ted? How much longer is he gonna be, though? I don't know. Just said he had to finish his letters. What, at this time of night? Typical, innit, fellas. - Drinks are ready. - Pardon? Drinks are ready. Oh, well, it's your round, isn't it? Well, you see... Don't worry about it. I'll get 'em. Avril, darling. Are these ours? You're going a bit strong tonight. Well, it only happens once, doesn't it? If you're lucky. Mind you, to me, three times. - Oh, it's tomorrow, isn't it? - Yes. We lose a good man tomorrow. He hands in his freedom at three o'clock. Shut up. I'll get this one. How much is it? Ninety pence. Or is it my last chance tonight? Listen, darling, have you got any food left? Sausages, sausages, or sausages. Oh. Well, then I'll have a pork pie. Just kidding. - What did you say? - Sausages. - I'll give you sausages. - Mmm! - Hello! - Hello. I thought you'd arrive in time for my round. Timed it specially. Thanks. I didn't think you were gonna make it, John. He's got no option. He's got to get me drunk tonight, so that tomorrow's events are just vague memories in the back of my mind, baby. Well, here's to your new life. And here's your new job. I'll drink to that. Yes, we all will. Take it easy, John. It's me who's getting married tomorrow, not you. Yes. Nice night. They all look the same. In whatever city you're in, Beirut, Tokyo, New York... they look dark. You look older. I'm sorry this is such a rush job. Here's half your money. Your instructions. This won't look like an accident. It doesn't have to. We wish to place the blame on the other side. Oh, don't worry. We'll have the right man in the wrong place at the right time. This is your target. Don't you want to know why he has to be eliminated? Would it make any difference if I did? No. How many men have you killed? How many have you? You don't know, do you? They're just a mass of faceless digits to you. Digits that you've eliminated, scratched, phased, or whatever the current euphemism may be. You couldn't even keep count, could you? Do you know, one of these days there's going to be a minute breakdown in your intricate machinery, and one of us is going to come all the way back to London and kill you. I think that's the most I ever heard you say. I don't usually bother. A sentence suffices. I understand you had some... trouble on your last one? No trouble. I'm thinking of packing it in. - What? - This. Oh, don't be ridiculous. Look, there's nothing stopping me packing this in right now. Oh, no? Then why don't you? - How's your hand? - Healing. This job is vitally important. - They always are. - That's why we got the best. Good night. Yeah. To publish those pictures is an infringement of security. I shouldn't worry. It's not your department. You've been promoted, remember? It's my responsibility. It's the responsibility of all of us. Come on, let's have another drink. That's more like it. Run out. Gonna get some more. All right? Don't you think you've had enough? No. I don't. Is this how you spent the night before you married me? Yes. Only I did it alone. You all right, Ted? You'd like to see me choke on it, wouldn't you? Suit you down to the ground. Don't like being passed over for a public schoolboy, do you? - No, I don't. - You people never learn. Years of service mean nothing. It's what you do with them that counts. And what are you gonna do with yours? Use 'em. Ah, yes, I can see that. What are you gonna get out of it all, then, John? Nothing. Not even a gold watch. They don't give 'em away with pensions... I have plenty. Don't you worry about that! I'm not worried about anything. I'm getting married tomorrow. You're gonna be my best man. Yeah? Thanks for the call. Bloody hell, what time is it? Time you were on your feet. Do you know, we thought you were dead? - At last! Breakfast? - Right. - It's now 9:15... - More coffee? - Oh, yeah, please. - Thank you. Is it hot and strong? "These are your instructions. "John Stacy, senior official, Air Ministry.

Yes, and he'll still be there a long time afterwards. - In the same position. - John's ambitious. No, darling. All squeezed out of him a long time ago. That's something else we have in common now. A good woman behind us. Don't forget you're getting married today. I can't forget about it until it's happened. Ted, I think you're the only man I know who started at the bottom, and went down. Coffee? Please. - Black? - Please. - What was all that about? - Nothing. - You sure? - He's just nervous. Don't you remember? & I'm livin' in a world of music.

I can't think why you want to see him, anyway. Because he's the top man. The governor, the gantse macher. What else? Are you enjoying that? Good. There he is. Doesn't look much, does he? Doesn't have to. Does he? He's a lovely mover. I'm sorry this is such a rush job. Don't you want to know why he has to be eliminated? How many men have you killed?

I've done it all because of you, you know. - What? - Everything. Perfect. Better get a brush for that coat. Mind the doors, please! Right, guard. All right! This'll do, Janik! It's just you and me now. No line of machine-guns behind you. It was an exchange, Janik. One of theirs for one of yours. He was old and sick. He could hardly cross the road. We changed our minds. You didn't have to kill him! I had no choice. You know that. We are professionals. We do what we're told. Keep talking, you bastard. Keep talking. We carry out our instructions. Excuse me. I'm sorry to trouble you, but do you have a cigarette? I'm sorry, I don't smoke. Mind the doors, please! Right, guard!

Give the poor bugger a chance. The best man! Come on, then. Well, I know the speeches will come later. - Great. - But I'd just like to propose the toast to the bride and groom. I'd like you to raise your glasses, and join with me in wishing them all the happiness and success in the world, which I know they'll achieve. The bride and groom! Bride and groom! Got a telegram. "Congratulations...” I'm sorry, love. - Excuse me. - Yes, madam? - Where's the ladies'? - Just through there. Yes, sir? A brandy and soda, please. Say "when", sir. When. Twenty-five, sir. Thank you.

You mean a real one, or straight out of the bottle? Straight out of the bottle. - Barman. - Sir? Sit down. - A Martini dry, please. - Very good, sir. - Hope you don't think... - Hmm? Well, you must have ladies coming up to you all the time, asking you to buy drinks. No, I don't, as a matter of fact. - Twenty, sir. - Thank you. Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. People think London's a very friendly place. It's not. It's... cold, and... It's all right if you've got a lot of friends, know loads of people. When you're a stranger in one room, just a gas fire, and no telly, it can be very lonely. Do you know what I mean? Yes, I know what you mean. You're a very attractive man. Thank you. - Hope you don't mind. - Hmm? I hope you don't mind me talking like this. No, not at all. I need somebody to talk to. Well, fire away. Can't talk here. Where, then? I'll just finish my drink. Excuse the mess. The other girls are going away. Can I get you something? No, thank you very much. Well, I'll just... I've only been here for three weeks. You don't say a lot, do you? No, I don't. Do you live in London? No. I didn't think so. A stranger can always tell another stranger. It doesn't matter where you are. A crowded street, a pub... You can still be alone. Sorry I was so long. Keeps telling me his life story. What time is it? Er... Just after three. Look, I wish you'd stop all that pacing about. It gets on my nerves. There's nothing you can do about this. You can't stop it. You can't take it over. It's nothing to do with us. We've been warned, just to keep us in the picture. Just in case. Anyway, they'd never send you out on a mission like this. Too dangerous. You enjoy your work too much. That's the difference between you and him. To him, it's just a job. To you... Shut up! Just shut your poxy mouth. This one really has got you, hasn't it? How does it feel to be a married woman? No different than it felt from being single. After all, we have been living together for over a year. Have you got your new place yet? Oh, yes, we put a down payment on a flat in Kensington. Ted's promotion came through just at the right moment. Yes, it must have. Such a surprise. We never expected it at all. Nor did anyone else. - It's a lovely cake. - Yes, my grandmother made it. We've still got the decoration from ours. Two figures in a horseshoe. How long have you and John been married? Eight years. - Come on. - Hmm? They're taking another photograph. It'll be a lot better now. With you. Can I see you again? I'm leaving this evening. I don't often stay in the same place for long. Will you be coming back to London again, then? Maybe. Can I see you, then? Maybe. - Do you do a lot of travelling? - Mm-hmm. That's what I'd like to do. Travel. Go lots of places, see lots of people. You can be just as lonely. Haven't you ever settled down in one place? I tried it once. I stopped work. That was a long time ago. Where will you go from here? - It depends. - On what? Circumstances. What do you do? I'm an engineer. Do you enjoy it? It's a job. Are you ticklish? Ticklish. Oh, come on. No, thank you. How did you do that? I got cut. It looks bad. It's healing. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Is it painful? It can be. Does it affect your work? No. Don't leave yet. Stay a little longer. I can't. Look, I'll make some coffee. No, thank you. Please, stay with me. - Please stay. - I can't. Please! Look, leave it, will you?! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Good luck. Christ. Stone me, by the time you're lined up on the geezer, he could have called down mortar fire. It's accuracy, not speed, that counts. Sometimes it's both. Like that. - Yes. - Control, this is Hamish. - We've made an error, I'm afraid. - What?! We've got the wrong target. You realise it's a bit bloody late to find out about that now? Yes, well, I can't help that, can I? Now, you're certain there's no mistake? There's no mistake. Stacy's been cleared. You must stop your assassin. I'll try, but it may be too late already. Get your boys onto it. Kill him yourself, if you have to. - You understand, don't you? - I'll do everything I can, sir. - Do that. - Yes, I'll call you back. Not long now, then. JAN OVER P.A.; Matthew and Luke to Control's office. What does he want now? - Hang about. - Hmm? As I said. "Accuracy, not speed.” I've still got the edge on you. Don't count on it. Matthew and Luke to Control's office, right away! All right, darling, we're comin'. What's it all about, then? We've got the wrong target. I've just heard from the Ministry. They say they're very sorry, can we call it off? Bit bloody late, isn't it? - That's what I said. - Typical. - The assassin? - Already gone. You know the place. You know his route. You must stop him, at all costs. How? Kill him. Beautiful. It must look like an accident, and I must have proof. Leave it to the old firm. Yeah. I have no choice. There, isn't that him? Yeah. That's our boy. Right. Oh, give us a drink. I only want a drink. - Want a... - Quiet! Oh, forgive me. John, we have to be off in a moment, but I just want to say thank you. Well, you know how grateful I am. - I know. - For both of us. I know. - John? - Yeah? Excuse us, Sue. Come on, my son. Where you hidin'? We haven't got much time left, you know. - Come on. - What? Just keep your cool. I'm not at all certain this is the right route. Look out your side. There he is. Now, don't lose him this time. All right! They're a lovely couple, aren't they? Bloody hypocrites. Just because you don't agree with them doesn't mean they're wrong. You don't agree with anyone. I don't see why we had to go there in the first place. Because it's a house-warming. You can't have a house-warming without people. Anyway, I don't know why you're complaining. You got through a whole bottle on your own. Ah, shut up, will ya? I'm surprised you're coherent enough to speak. Just drop the subject, will you? Right, let's get him. Slow down! You're going too fast! Lovely. Here we go. If you wanna drive this car, you can drive the bloody thing. WOMAN; Look out, Tom! - Stop. - Oh, my God! What a liberty. He's ours. Drive on, Tom, for God's sake! Let's see what the elders have done with him. Yeah, he's dead. Now, then... - Come out all right? - Lovely. Why the hell didn't you tell me? Can't you trust us to do a simple job of liquidation without putting a watchdog on our heels? Why didn't you recall him when we recalled our man? What use is he to you if you can't reach him? I mean, what the hell do you expect me to do about it now? There's no time left! Matthew. Matthew, come in. Matthew, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, - I'd be extremely... - Matthew to Control. Target topped in terrifying traffic tragedy. I've got your proof. Did you get the back-up man? What? What back-up man? For Christ's sake, stop him! This job will turn me into an adrenaline junkie. I thought you carried it all off splendidly. Thank you. They look happy enough, anyway. This morning, Ted said... He implied I'd held you back, work-wise. That's not true, is it? Not at all. I'm not that ambitious. John? I think they're just about ready now. Looks like they want me to get the car round. Oh. Wait, I'll get my bag. We're not gonna make it. Shit. You've heard of a hearse. This is a His 'n' Hearse! Well, goodbye, John. - Look after everything while I'm away. - I will. I'm sure the Ministry won't grind to a halt without me. Oh, I shouldn't think so. And thank you. Thank you for everything. If I said anything last night to upset you, I'm sorry. It's forgotten, Ted. Thank you. The air tickets. Here is the Six O'Clock News. An Air Ministry official, John Stacy, was shot dead this afternoon while attending a colleague's wedding reception. The Arabs have again accused Israeli guerrillas of making raids across the border into Palestine. In Ulster, a bomb has exploded in a shopping centre, killing a child aged six, and injuring her mother. The violent death this afternoon of John Stacy, a senior official in the Air Ministry, has already had widespread political repercussions. The Home Secretary was unavailable for comment about the murder, but it was stated, from an official source... SUBTITLES BY POWERHOUSE FILMS LTD
