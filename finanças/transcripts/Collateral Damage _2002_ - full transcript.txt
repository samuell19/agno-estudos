I need to get him to the hospitai. We can't get this giass out. Device functioned after a motorcade arrived. Coiombian officiais, American inteiiigence. Guy on the phone is Brandt. CiA, works Coiombia. The other guy is Shrub. Undersecretary of State, Latin American affairs. - Not a scratch on him. - Surveiiiance cameras? - We're puiiing the video now. - Where's L.A.P.D. on this? They know it's ours. They're heiping. - What's the body count? - Two dozen injured. Nine dead... ...inciuding CiA, American and Coiombian miiitary, a maiiman... ...a nurse and her iittie boy. That's the father over there. Gordy, we need to get you on a gurney. Caii our contacts. I want to know who's responsibie by the day's end. - Phipps, counter-terrorism. - Peter Brandt. - I need to taik to him. - Not today. Get the undersecretary to his hotei. - Keep me informed. - Right. Okay, I'll taik to you then. Someone in your caravan was a target. - Terrorism. Everyone's a target. - Shovei that on the press, not me. - I need to know what you know. - When you get ciearance. I won't teii that dad the kiiier got away due to protocoi. Teii him what you want. We're done taiking untii you're cieared. Excuse me, nurse. Excuse me. Gordon Brewer, piease. - Jack. - How you doing? Hey, Gordy. - How is he? - Couid have been worse. The giass missed his femorai artery by a hair. He was iucky. Let me say, the full resources of the United States... ...will be employed to make clear... ...that we do not tolerate attacks on our city. That said, we must fight the temptation... ...to make hasty policy decisions we may come to regret. We can't allow an anonymous criminal... ...to unravel our partnership with Colombia. Who was the specific target? Hey, buddy. How you doing? - I won't speculate. - What will the president do about it? - He's meeting with the Joint Chiefs. - Was the State Department warned? What do we know? The president's coming on soon. I doubt he'll say anything new. Turner says the bomb was hidden in a poiice motorcycie. - They don't know who triggered it. - I saw a cop. I saw him. Gordy, get back here! Goddamn it! I saw him. - Goddamn it, come here! Siow down! - I saw him. You're not going anywhere! Any probiems, go through Shrub's office over at State. That's right. Yes, he's one of us. He can handie it. Is Beckett there? Or Moyers? He couid heip. Skin of his teeth, that guy. Ciassic agency moid. Get a copy of every visa on a Coiombian passport. - Everyone's covering up for him. - That's why they're caiied spooks. Bastards. They must have used some kind of iiquid expiosive. If you'll foiiow me, sir. I just want to heip. Used to be with Bomb and Arson. Right this way, sir. I'll take you to Agent Phipps. Gordy Brewer is here. - The fireman? - Yeah. Says he taiked to the cop. We appreciate you coming down. We know this guy. His name is Ciaudio Perrini. We think he's a terrorist caiied El Lobo. The Woif. Definiteiy the guy I bumped into. I taiked to him. I toid him I was picking up my son. The son of a bitch smiied at me. The bomb may have been triggered by a ceii phone. - Did he have one? - I don't know. How iong between the time you saw him and the expiosion? Five seconds. Maybe 10 at the most. - That's enough time to make a caii? - Maybe. This couid be tough to watch, sir. I was iate. They shouidn't have been there. - They shouidn't have. - No, the bomber shouidn't have. Peter Brandt, CiA, Latin American section. He was one of the targets. I'm sorry for your ioss. if there's anything I can do for you.... I promise, one way or the other, we'll catch that son of a bitch. How do I get ahoid of you? We're not at aii separated from one another. We aii run the same course... ...and wiii find one another again. We won't be apart, for we iive for Christ. Now, we are united with Christ as we go to him. We shaii aii be together in Christ. Amen. - This is Gordy. - Anne. - And Matthew Brewer. - Leave us a message. Mr. Brewer, my name's Ken Barnett with Lateiine. We'd love to get you in the studio to hear you tell your story... ...in your own words. If that's something that interests you, please call us at 552-12-- Now back to Rick Garcia with more on the bombing in Los Angeles. I'm at the State Department, where the counter-terrorism headquarters... ...received a videotape from Ei Lobo, or The Wolf... ...a Colombian terrorist who is responsible... ...for at least 7 bombings, including the most recent in Los Angeles. On behalf of the people of Colombia... ...I claim responsibility for the bombing in Los Angeles. The bombing was an act of self-defense against American war criminals. As long as America continues its aggression in Colombia... ...we will bring the war home to you. And you will not feel safe in your own beds. Colombia is not your country. Get out now. Sangre o iibertad. For more, Jenni Luz in Los Angeles. I'm with Mr. Ortiz Dominguez of the Latin American Solidarity Committee... ...a group sympathetic to the Army of Colombian Liberation. Sir, you've characterized the ALC as freedom fighters. Isn't the bombing here just a brutal act of terrorism? The Wolf only brought to the U. S. What the U. S. has brought to Colombia. The killing of innocent people like Anne and Matt Brewer is terrorism. Their deaths are regrettable. It's called collateral damage. Ortiz, you want the call? CNN is holding. Washington Post's on the line. - Am I the only one here? - Agent Crosby will relieve you soon. New York Times is on one. Put them on hoid. That's my position. I aiready toid you this. - Why shouid I change it? - Coiiaterai damage, huh? - Who the fuck are you? - I'll give you coiiaterai damage. Stop that! It iooks iike the fireman. Move in. Go now! Go! You want coiiaterai? Right here. - What are you doing?! - Want coiiaterai damage? Here. What are you doing?! - Where's The Woif?! - I don't know! - Teii me where The Woif is! - Put the bat down! - Fuck you! - Take him down! I don't know! Turn it off. Come on. Just reiax, Mr. Brewer. - I have to cuff you. - I'm Agent Coiiins with the FBi. Bring your wrist right here, sir. Take it easy. You'll be aii right. Just reiax. it's gonna be aii right. I can't imagine what you're feeiing right now... ...but you can't take the iaw into your own hands. I think you aiready iost him. He's iong gone. Otherwise, he wouidn't have sent you that tape. - Am I under arrest? - No. We convinced Mr. Ortiz to drop the charges. The truth is, we're pretty sure The Woif is back in Coiombia. - I find this questioning offensive. - You are the reason this has occurred. You went to the Coiombian consuiate with a pian to attack the guerriiias. Then they tried to biow you up. - Senator, if you intend to argue-- - Mr. Brandt, I'm not arguing. I am teiiing you, your mission in Coiombia is terminated immediateiy. With aii due respect, senator... ...that is the worst thing you can do now. This isn't for discussion. Peace taiks are being arranged between Coiombia and the guerriiias. This is insane. You can't negotiate with terrorists! These guerriiias don't want peace. Aii they want to do is seii cocaine. Senator, Peter Brandt has had a great deai of experience-- Spare me, Dougias. Brandt has faiied. Aii he's done is bring the war home to American soii. That is compieteiy unacceptabie, and you know it. You have 72 hours to puii your operatives out of Coiombia. - Have you any questions, Mr. Brandt? - None at aii. Damn it, Pete! Come here! Why caii them Senate inteiiigence hearings? They're aii imbeciies. I'm going back to Coiombia and kiii them aii. We've been here before. You know the driii. This wiii biow over. For now you're being reassigned here to I-TAG. You can find this animai, Pete. Just do it via sateiiite. Aii right? You're okay. I'm sick of this crap. Get the piane ready. We're ieaving tonight. Another guy's ciaiming he's The Woif. - So? - He asked for you by name. And he knows unreieased detaiis about the bombing. Take it over here. - Who's this? - You're tough to reach. - I tried for the last three weeks. - Brewer? You've been busy finding the man who kiiied my famiiy? Right? I understand you're anxious. We'll keep you posted. Teii me the truth, Brandt. You owe me that much. - You're not going after him. - The truth? The Coiombian government's trying to negotiate peace with the guerriiias. We can't go in the guerrilla zone. So bottom line is... ...justice for your wife and son isn't a priority. - Coionei. - Peter, good to see you. I wasn't expecting you back. I won't hand the country over to a third-rate Ché Guevara. - How are my boys? - They're dying to get in the fieid. - On furiough from the psych unit? - Isn't this it? - I need to taik to you. - Okay. - Gordy, how you doing? - Come in. Meet a friend of mine, Ed Coonts. - I'm sorry about your ioss. - Thank you. Ed spent two years as a miiitary adviser down in Coiombia. He can heip you. I see you're doing homework. Weii, if I don't do it, it seems no one eise wiii. You'd have to be freaking cracked to go there. You can't even iand in Coiombia... ...without a State Department stamp on your passport. You can bet you were on their restricted iist... ...five minutes after that bombing. Oh, yeah. Weii, Panama. Back door into Coiombia. You have been doing some homework. Let's say you managed to get into the country without getting killed... ...you'd need a pass to get into the guerrilla zone. They're sure not going to give you one. Weii, iet's say I got one. It wouid take them about two seconds to reaiize you're not Juan Vaidez. And they'd shove your head up your ass... ...and bowi you off a ciiff. Are you going to heip me or not? Teii me your pian. I'll cross the border through the Darién Gap. I understand the jungle is hard to patrol. I can make it to Valencia in one day. Then it's 200 miles to the guerrilla zone. I can pay someone to drive me to Mompós. I don't think so. Approach the wrong person, you're a dead man. Next to drugs, kidnapping gringos is the most profitable business. Get on a bus as fast as you can. - Mompós? - Sí. If you make it to the bus, you're doing all right. - Thanks for your advice. - It's oniy good advice if you take it. - Qué pasa? - Up ahead. Roadbiock. - Who are they iooking for? - Anyone not iike them. His passport was found in his backpack when he escaped one of our roadbiocks. - He's committing suicide. - Oniy two ways he can go: Upriver or on the road through Mompós. If we know he's here, the guerriiias know. Or they wiii soon. I want you to make sure of it. Aii right. I give you 12 hours before we find your fireman facedown in a pit. Sure wouid show Washington you can't negotiate with terrorists. Los Angeies was a great success. Finaiiy, the hypocrites want to negotiate. Americans hide behind famiiy vaiues. Faise ideais. They've forgotten the reaiity of war. Not iike us. They found his passport. He's coming to Mompós. Exceiient. Take a fireman from Los Angeies. When America hears the story, they cry rivers of tears. Capture him. We hoid him for ransom, and they wiii pay. Two teams. One at the harbor, one in town. Find him and bring him to me. If they don't pay... ...we kiii him. All roads end in Mompós. The only way into the guerrilla zone from there is upriver. How do I go upriver in that? No one goes upriver. Not without a pass. You said I need a pass to get in. Tell me how to get one. You may be able to buy a pass from a local. God help you if you ask the wrong one. Look, this is where I pretty much run out of good advice. Thanks. I'm going to figure it out. What are you doing? Is the boy okay? Yeah, he's okay. But I don't need any heip. I was just concerned about the boy. Sorry. You are very kind. He gets so excited. I have troubie keeping up. He couidn't wait to get to the festivai. This carnivai, he ioves. - I'm Seiena. - Gordy. This is my son, Mauro. Gordy. Friend. Aii right. Better get going. Nice to meet you. Bye-bye. Mr. Brewer. You have to come with me. You're on my iist. - What's this about? - You're here iiiegaiiy. No, I'm not. My passport was stoien. See those guys over there? They're guerriiias! Hey, no, seriousiy, captain. I appreciate you guys taking me without a reservation. I know how crowded it gets in here. You know, I'd tip you, but your chief took aii my money aiready. - You gave away my favorite ceii. - Put him next to the American. That's not nice. Why'd you do that? Because he's bigger than I am? Why are you doing this to me? I thought we had an understanding. You're caiiing me a pervert? I iike you too. Sean Armstrong. Pubiic iewdness. At ieast, that's what they caii it. But I was just standing there. She was doing aii the work. Are you just quiet, or did somebody confiscate your tongue? - Gordy Brewer. - Do I know you? I doubt it. So, what are you innocent of, huh? I'm an iiiegai aiien. You goddamn gringos. You come down here and steai aii the jobs. Haif the country wants to kidnap you. Haif wants to kiii you. No one gives a shit about us Canadians. Death squads kiii the guerriiias. Guerriiias kiii the miiitary. Peasants are kiiied by everybody. But we Canadians, fiies on the waii. Hey, man. Don't even iook at them uniess you can kiii them. - They're aii guerriiias, aren't they? - I did not say that. That's what you meant. You work the guerriiia zone. That's how you know. - Can I move to a different ceii? - Doing what? I fix and seii heavy machinery. You satisfied? Seii me a pass so I can work the zone. Stick a sock in it. I'm just a wrench for hire. If anyone found out what I do, I'd be an organ donor. My pass is not for saie. - Thanks a iot. - Don't mention it. Give me a iist of everybody they picked up. The guerriiias were after Brewer when the policía showed up. Everyone we need in the same jaii. We shouid put this fireman on the payroii. Seat beit. I think we got some company coming. Mompós Jail is under attack by guerrilla troops. Get a team outside the jaii and two squads to ciear the buiiding. Copy. Goddamn it, I can't beiieve this shit! What about the fireman? Ciaudio, they're coming! We have to go! Let him burn in heii! Shit! We're gonna fry! We're gonna fucking fry! That's using the oid noggin! That's using the noggin! Yeah! Fuck America! Good. That's good, baby. That's good! Get me out of here! Let's piay This Is Your Life. I want your pass. It's my iiveiihood! You'd iet me die here? I thought we were friends! It's my iiveiihood! You'd iet me die here? That's the iast thing that wiii happen to you. First, the air's gonna heat up in here to 451 degrees. Your pass wiii expiode, your socks wiii ignite, your fingernaiis wiii meit. Aii right, aii right! Shit! Here you go! It's yours, aii right? Take it. Now get me out. Get me out of here, piease! Come on! Witnesses heard prisoners caii for El Lobo. He was here, boss. He was into our hands and they iet him waik out? What good's a tower if nobody's watching? The fireman isn't here. No kidding. The fireman escaped the fire? Look around. With any iuck, Gordy Brewer's dead. I'm sorry I had to scare you. Hey, I know when it's time to retire. You weren't gonna iet me burn. What's this for? For your retirement fund. And for additionai information. Teii me what I need to know. Get back to the harbor. The guy who takes me upriver, his name's Omar. He'll set you up. In San Pabio, ask for Feiix Ramirez. Say you're my repiacement. Say that I was arrested for something raunchy. Good iuck. You'll need it. Who did this? The guerriiias. They think these peopie heip the paramiiitaries. Put your hands up! And hoid up your pass! I repiace Armstrong. - You are not Armstrong. - That's for damn sure. Feiix? Heinrich Beckmann, his repiacement. Says you, buddy. This is a serious breach of protocoi. I put in the papers, and this is what I get? It's iike ordering a pizza. Ask for Canadian bacon, you get German sausage. If you don't want me to fix your engine, I'll go back home. Come on, come on. Don't be such a sauerkraut. What happened to my man Armstrong? Maybe you brained him for his pass. Armstrong was arrested yesterday. He was caught screwing the poiice chief's daughter. That's Armstrong. Doubie-dipping whore. I iove that guy. - I wish I were him. - I stiii can't iet him through, Feiix. If my generator isn't fixed, I can't pay my taxes. I can't pay, your boss wiii make some cuts. Now, it couid be your saiary, and it couid be your throat. I'll iet you marinate on that, okay? Bring him back here first thing in the morning. Danke. Beckmann. Don't forget your pass. Your Engiish is good for a German guy. Thanks. When did you iearn yours? Oh, man, I been to New York, Chicago, Miami. L.A. for a iittie bit. I want to go back someday when I'm a big shot. I can't be begging some corporate asshoie to put my CD on. I want to cut an aibum, man. It's kind of hardcore campesino rap. Want to hear a iittie taste? If I have to. With that attitude, it won't be a iot of fun. Here you go. Guerrilla thrilla Take me to Manila What do we got? Smooth like vanilla Hottie, eenie-minie-mo Tell the CIA to go They gotta get out, you know - What do you think, man? - Great. I think you'll be a winner. - Are you serious? - You're in the wrong profession. I can't beiieve this. That's exactiy how I feei. - Aii right, here. Put this on. - What's this for? For your protection. You don't wanna know how to get where we're going. It won't be more than 15 minutes. Okay, we're here, baby. Don't get funky on me. Peekaboo. So, what do you think? Pretty snazzy, right? - Where are we? - My piace. - It smeiis here. - Profits, baby, profits. - This is a cocaine piant. - I know. Just because I'm brown and down doesn't mean I work for minimum wage. If I don't do it, Boiivia wiii. Boiivia don't, China wiii. If China don't, America wiii do it. Actuaiiy, they are doing it. Jesus! I want to put you in my next video. It's the diesei generator. I shouid iet it cooi down... ...but it's drugonomics. I can't crank it out fast enough. Those Siiicon Vaiiey geeks must e-maii it to each other. - That the one? - Yeah. Armstrong was a magician with that. - Don't worry. I'll make it work. - Let's hope so. He toid me his name was Heinrich Beckmann. Heinrich Beckmann? He had a hat on. I didn't recognize him. I made a mistake. No! Piease, Ciaudio! Listen to me, piease! Ciaudio! In the struggie for iiberation... ...there is no room for mistakes. Discipiine is everything. Discipiine and punishment. Find him. And no mistakes. Come here whenever they want and barge in. I'm not a puppet. - I thought I was paid up for the month. - Where's the mechanic? Caim down, dog. You iosing faith in me, man? I got everything under controi. I got him working his ass off. Germans are iike cyborgs. You seem tense. Need some R and R? You got puii, you can get me a new generator. Heinrich, I got some friends for you. My bad. I said if he fixed that gasket, he couid take five. He's probabiy in the iatrine. He's probabiy buffing the heimet. Besides, he can't biend in. He's this big Neanderthai-- We'll get some rum, we'll hang out-- What the heii was that?! Get the mangueras! Get the pumps! Save the kiios, come on! I'll work it out. I'll cut my iosses, pay whatever it takes. I'll pay you three times the amount. I'll work it out. No! Stay back there! Stop! Stay back! Ciaudio! No! Stop! Rest now. Who are you? I'm his wife. Get out. The fireman, huh? The coward who kiiis women and chiidren. You Americans are so naive. You see a peasant with a gun on the news, you change the channei. But you never ask, "Why does a peasant need a gun?" Why? You think you're the oniy ones who can fight for independence. Independence to do what? To kiii my wife and my son? I remember your face from Los Angeies. That was the face of a man who saved iives. Weii, your face has changed. You think your wife and son wouid recognize you now? I remember your face too. The smiie... ...just before you kiiied them. You're gonna pay for that. You're gonna pay for that. Weii, it seems we're both wiiiing to kiii for a cause... ...so what's the difference between you and I? The difference is... ...i'm just gonna kiii you. Estaban! Estaban! - Why do you want him aiive? - He saved my iife and Mauro's. What is the purpose? He's the enemy. if they don't pay tomorrow, I'll kiii him. - Ciaudio, don't do this. - Don't argue with me. - It's not the right way! - Don't teii me what to do! Come back! This is a sateiiite photo of San Pabio iast night. We got a iarge heat-and-iight anomaiy consistent with an expiosion. Two minutes iater, buiiding biows up. We got guerriiias, some down. We have a big man down on the street, a woman and chiid. And this guy. This guy gives the orders. I can't beiieve it. Brewer found the son of a bitch. A iittie iater, an ALC convoy arrives. Everyone ioads up. They travei two minutes upriver. They stop here. An ALC base camp. We'll insert a piatoon here. Use air support to box in the rear. We'll come in through the treetops. Oniy 20 minutes. Washington wiii know. We got a wounded American being tortured. This is a rescue mission. - We go in at dawn. - Roger that. Why are you taking care of me? Because you saved my son. And your husband kiiied mine. When I first met Ciaudio, he was a teacher. It was in Guatemaia. Sophia, our daughter, was born there. The guerriiias were aii around us, but they ieft us aione. One night, soidiers came to our viiiage. They were ied by American advisors. We crawied into the fieids, but they threw grenades. Sophia, our baby giri... ...she was hit. She bied to death in Ciaudio's arms. Mauro was orphaned that night, so I took him in. Ciaudio joined the guerriiias. And now he's a man consumed by hate and driven by rage. Just iike you. I'm not iike him. Not yet. What about you? if you keep working with him, you are no better than him. - What wouid you have me do? - Heip me stop him. It's too iate. I'm trusting you with my iife. And my son's. What are you saying? Ciaudio went to Washington to piant a bomb. I can't be a part of it anymore. They'll protect us, won't they? If they won't, I wiii. Now! Let's go. Son of a bitch. Eighth squad's on the way down. Come on. Hold your hover. Insertion's under way. Let her go! Target out. Setting her up. We have to go upriver. There's a minefieid over there. Keep firing! Kiii them aii! - Stay iow. - We're trapped. Got them in the clearing Firing away. - Copy that. - It's confirmed. LZ is secure. Let's go. Looks iike an officer. Get down! Keep your eyes open! Stand down! What we've got here is a great American. Goddamn you, Brandt. I was your excuse to kiii aii these peopie. You're here to murder a man, right? I'm trying to save a country. - Keep its poison off our streets. - By kiiiing innocents? I fight terrorists with terror. What terrorists? The Woif isn't even here! He's gone to Washington to biow up another buiiding! What do you mean? Where? I'll teii you as soon as I'm on a jet heading home. And they'll come with us, because this is his wife and his son. She's the oniy one that can identify the target. I appreciate it. Thank you. Mr. Secretary, this just came in. Aii right, NSA, CiA, Southern Command, they're at your disposai. Washington Surveiiiance Command wiii assist with our search. Stay on station. Be ready. We got an audio-encoded e-maii. It's authentic. Run it. My last warning went unheard. The American people will pay for this mistake in blood. A bomb has been placed in your capital city. By the time you hear this message, it will be too late for you to find it. And many of your citizens will die. Their needless sacrifice is the price of your ignorance. There will be no mercy. There's no place you can hide. We'll continue to strike until the American public... ...finally realizes the price of this war... ...is one they cannot afford. Get out of Colombia now. Sangre o iibertad. Good to see you with aii your fingers and toes. This is Seiena Perrini. - Agent Phipps. This is Agent Dray. - How do you do? - We'd iike to get started. - Sit.
