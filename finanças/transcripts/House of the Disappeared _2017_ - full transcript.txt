Hyo Jae. Husband! Husband? Hyo Jae... Hyo Jae. Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae. Hyo Jae. Are you okay? It's all right now. Come here. Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae! A housewife, Mrs. Gang, has been arrested for murdering her entire family. The body of her husband, Mr. Kim, was found in the home. Only blood from her son has been found, but not his body. Thus, police believe that Mrs. Gang is the most likely suspect. They speculate that after the murder, she likely abandoned her son's body elsewhere. Presently, they are doing a thorough search of the area surrounding the crime scene. 6617, Gang Mi Hui. The world has changed a lot, hasn't it? Is her house ready to live in? The electricity and water have been turned on. The roof has had some spot repair. Hey, how can it be repaired like that? People in the neighborhood sometimes make trouble. They want this house to be torn down. There are the stories, and everyone feels it's unlucky. Nobody wants to go near it. 6617, Gang Mi Hui. You know your prison term has not ended yet, right? For now, if you want to leave the house, you must notify the police. Until your prison term ends, these officers will stay here. Just live here quietly. Even if you do go out, don't expect a welcome. You'll be lucky if they don't throw rocks at you. Watch her closely. Let me know immediately if anything happens. Do a good job. Why didn't she say anything? Throat cancer. Come out! I said come out! Ji Won, let's go together. I was late to the academy class, Mom. That's why you should go there straight from school. - I know you fool around. - Mom. What? You said this yourself. It doesn't matter if you're lazy, as long as you're healthy. That's why I work so hard at playing! - Me too, me too! - You guys are too much. Are you teasing your mother? Dad! Eat some of this. No thanks. Take good care of your brother. Okay. Eat. You two, don't spend all day just playing. Be sure to get your homework done early. Also, your academy teacher called and... Hey! Hey! Finish eating before you go! We're going! Hello. Sister Veronica Gang Mi Hui. I'm from the church congregation... wait! I heard you previously belonged to our parish. Just leave. Anyway, I actually... You just need to fill out this information. Could I come in for a minute? Okay. Wow, this house. Every year on Christmas and Easter, I do a service at the Cheongsim Detention Center. What does a priest know about prisoners? I know a lot. All of the people in there, they are all children of God. There is no God. I'm not a believer anymore. Why did you come to see me? Actually... I came because I was curious. That day... what really happened? Leave. I'm the winner! What do you mean? I'm the winner! First place! Hurry, hurry! Second place. I lost because of you. Oh, I'm dying. I'm dying. What? Hey, you brats. How many hours do you play this? Where do you get the money? - Don't tell me you kids... - Run! Hurry, hurry! You brats! You brats! I know who all of you are, you rotten brats! Yeon Hui, put out your hand. See you guys tomorrow! Take care! See you later! What was that? Hyeong, do you like Yeon Hui? Hey, am I crazy? Then why do you take her on your bike? That's not because I like her. Then why? It's not because I like her. Yeon Hui doesn't have a bicycle. Hey, you do like her! Fine. I like her. See? You do like her. I'll tell my mom we did our homework at the academy. I already know! Don't say anything stupid. Okay! We're back! You kids! Apologize right now and say you were wrong! Mom. Your father is a policeman. A policeman! You actually play these tricks out there? I'm sorry. I can guarantee this will never happen again. Say, you know... that's not the problem. It's just... Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Take care. You've been skipping your academy class. Move your hand, or it will get broken. Okay, you can go. Ji Won, come over here. Mom, I'm sorry! Come here! I'm responsible for Ji Won. Ji Won didn't do anything wrong. That's right. You're his older brother. His older brother. What did the priest say at mass last week? He said no matter when, God is always watching. What else? He said sincere prayer will give you the answer. That's right. Every night I pray to the Virgin Mary for all of you, but... I guess I haven't been sincere enough. I was wrong. You don't mean it. If you ever do this again... You know, right? Yes. Mom. What? Then, if I pray really hard... Yes. If you pray, then? Will I not die as young as Dad? My son will absolutely not be like that. The doctor told me, in America they are doing research to cure your disease, Hyo Jae. You just need to wait for a while. You will be cured. No matter what happens, I will make sure you are cured. That bastard, I should kill him. It's not easy to catch someone. Why did they let him go already? What the hell? I can't even go home. Damn it. Good. Honey, it's been a while... If you want to go out wearing clothes, don't get caught. What the heck are you talking about? Don't worry about me. I never expected anything from you anyway. What? Oh, it's because of this! You're so sweet, Honey. You're so sweet, Honey. Seriously, who the fuck am I working for? When a man comes home from work, he deserves to be comfortable! Why do you complain... Shit. She likes to play games. Is it you, Ji Won? Is it you, Husband? Stop fooling around. Who is it? Who is it? Is that you, Hyeong? Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae, open the door! Hyo Jae! Did you just scream? Ji Won. Ji Won, was it you? Did you just scream? Yes. Why? My brother. Hyo Jae? He came and he scared me. What? Someone smashed the door and tried to come in. Then, did you see that person's face? No. It was probably those guys. Who do you mean, Detective Kim? A gang of Taiwanese kids. I've been watching a few of them. I said they shouldn't let them go so easily. Hey, didn't you say you weren't at home? They why would they do this to some young kids? I guess those red punks took advantage because I wasn't home. Hey, it's frustrating to have to keep every door locked! Only your wife's fingerprints are on everything. It was a little bit strange. It didn't really seem like a person. Crazy... Say something that makes sense. Make sense. Hey. How long have you lived in this house? We moved in right after we were married. I guess around 10 years. When we got married, my boss showed me this property. It was empty and cheap. After Ji Won was born, I transferred ownership into my wife's name only. Hey, Hyo Jae. Hyo Jae? Did you see anything here last night? Hurry and speak up, kid. Hyo Jae. Tell him! Hyo Jae. What's wrong with you? Tell me. Did you see anything yesterday? What is this? Who gave this to you? Hyo Jae, tell me. I asked who gave this to you. Excuse me, Father. Recently, I... Never mind. Ma'am, Ma'am! Don't be offended, but listen to me carefully. The aura of your house doesn't seem very good. Our house? The aura is not good. Spirits... they gather there. Something frightening happened recently, right? Call this number. He's a very skilled feng shui master. I've gone all around the outside. So... there is something strange about this house. What should... Well... It's a bit hard to explain. My son is not a child who would lie. Could I have some coffee? Of course. The energy point is in the north. The inner circle is dead. Wow. This place is really unusual. But I am a powerful feng shui master. By any chance, did you move in just recently? No. Then have you done any plumbing or changed the location of the front door? We haven't. You haven't... Please drink this. What is down here? It's just the basement... We store things in there. What is this door? Can I open it for a moment? O-Open it. What's wrong? Wait. Just a moment. Wait. What happened? Didn't you hear the voices just now? What voices? Madam. You should find someone else. First, tell me what happened. There is a problem, but I don't know what it is. The best solution is for you just to move out. The best solution is for you just to move out. Madam. To be honest, this has nothing to do with the feng shui. Rather, it's... just... Rather, it's... just... It would be better to call in a shaman. Hello. Your excommunication has been processed. Fine. You can go. Could I have some coffee? I'm sorry that I was rude last time. Because I'm a little familiar with your case, I've noticed a lot of doubtful facts. If you'd like to make a confession, then as a priest, I am ready to listen to everything. Last time, you said you understood prisoners very well, right? They're children of God? Because of those children of God, I was almost tortured to death. Do you know why I held onto life by my teeth? Just so I could look for my son. To come back to this house... and find him. That's the truth. You said you want to know what really happened that day? Sister. Don't worry what others say. I... prefer to believe what you say. Please tell me. Who did it? Them. They did it. There are others in this house. Hyo Jae... was taken away by them. So, Gang Mi Hui came here in 1984. Before that, she was living with her grandparents, is that right? Yes, Father. If that's what it says in the file, that's how it is. Then, do you know who lived there before? Our information... that's all the data we have. I have no way of knowing. Why get so angry? What? Is there a problem? No. He keeps asking about No. 34 in Euryong-dong. No. 34 in Euryong-dong... That... Didn't that used to be called a haunted house? There have also been missing person cases. Right. That one. There was a murder 25 years ago and the son is still missing. I don't really know about it. Was it in the 60's? It seems like a whole family went missing! What? When I was in elementary school. That must have been around the mid 60's. A whole family disappeared. Just like smoke. It was very mysterious. That house... is strange. It definitely is. But, Father Choe, why do you need information on this old case? I want to hold a prayer for the victims in the case. So you do that kind of thing. I'm on duty today. You can look around at your leisure. Brother Bae Du, please come to our mass next time. Oh, mass. - Go on inside. - Okay. November 11, 1967. No. 34, Euryong-dong. An incident occurred where a family disappeared without a trace. There was no trace of a home invasion. The residents disappeared. The missing people... were a mother and two young daughters. Come out! Didn't I say you can't go out? I told you to be quiet. - Right? - Stop doing that. Stop moving so much. I told you not to move. Isn't this much prettier? Stop, that's enough. It looks pretty. Just do half of it. No. That's okay. I don't want it. Who are you? Get out! Who are you? Who are you? Please. Please. Give me back my son. Give Hyo Jae back to me, please. Who is doing this to me? Why? I must be out of my mind. Is anyone here? Are you looking for the shaman? Our shaman had a little accident. Actually, she should have been dead 7 years ago. But because of her skill, she was able to hover between life and death. She's not able to see now, but as she moves between the planes of life and death, she is able to see. She heard that you need help. Your house... how can you live in it? Why are you sprinkling the salt? Gods will step on it as they come over. As the ceremony progresses, you should not step outside this circle. Be careful. That person... Who is it? Who? The shaman has now been possessed. Get out of here quickly! Those people are still here. Give me that piece of paper. Why aren't you leaving? Why aren't you leaving? Okay. From now on, this is extremely important. Close your eyes. You absolutely cannot open them. What is that sound? Just listen. You can die, so you must not open your eyes. Daddy! You killed my child! Father, please! Whose voice is that? What are you doing? Both of you did this! You're both the same! Daddy, I was wrong. I was wrong! I killed my child! Father, please! Daddy! Daddy! Don't kill me! Please don't kill me! Please don't kill me! Please! Shut up! Stop! Stop! Stop right now! Please calm down. It's not over yet! If we stop now, something terrible will happen. I don't care! Please leave right now. I'll said get out of here! I'm back. What time is it now, you kids? It's because I was at Jae Jun Ho's house. What about Ji Won? Where is Ji Won? Earlier, he said he was leaving. Ji Won isn't home yet? What? Ji Won! Where is he? Ji Won! Where is he? Ji Won! Ji Won! Ji Won! Ji Won! Ji Won! What is this? Be careful. Be careful. Seong Chung. Don't be like this, Ji Won. Don't die, Ji Won. Don't be like this. Don't die. Don't die! Ji Won! - Detective, don't be this way. - Damn it. Seriously. Ji Won, get up! - Don't be this way. - Damn you! Ji Won. Ji Won. Get up, Ji Won. No, Ji Won. Ji Won. Because of you, Ji Won is dead! You should go and die! - How could you let this happen to our Ji Won? Because of you, Ji Won is dead! Stop it! Stop it! It's not Hyo Jae's fault! Stop it, Husband! Ji Won! Ji Won! It's Dad! What are you doing? Hurry and stop him. It was all my fault. I never looked out for Ji Won. Hyo Jae. It's like the priest said before. When a good child dies, they will become an angel. Really? Yes. Then Ji Won... he will be in the Holy Mother's embrace. He will always be with us. In 1942, mixing the best Japanese methods of natural science and occultism, the house was built for General Watabe Kunio when he came to Joseon. Natural science and occultism. He was very insistent that the house be built on that location. On December 12, General Watabe Kunio and his family were killed in this house. Reporter Pak Eul Saeng. Inside that house, in 1967, and in 1992, similar cases of disappearance also occurred? Yes. In the story I wrote, the same thing also happened in 1942. That house... No. Should I say the "event"? All of you. What you're doing is wrong. - If you continue, everyone will die! - At that time, the exploitation by the Japanese was just too much. A great rage was simmering in the farmers. As a result, in order to capture the General, whom they saw as a pioneer, the farmers broke in. Ultimately, the farmers killed the General and his wife. That's the report. In truth, those people, didn't kill anyone at all. Something mysterious had occurred. A housemaid they had captured, showed the farmers to their hiding place. But inside, there was only the side of a strange wall. The General and his wife had disappeared without a trace. Then... there were other disappearance cases? Even now, I can still remember what happened back then. In the basement of that house, I was not far from death. I was not far from death. When you need guidance, Father, how could I lie to you? Lord, is this truly your will? No matter what, strange things happen in this house. Look. In 1942, General Watabe and his wife disappeared without a trace. And then in 1967, a mother and her 2 daughters disappeared without a trace. Another missing person case. Also, just as you said, in 1992, once again, your son went missing. The cycle repeats every 25 years. Today is that date. I... have seen these people before. They... are in this house. Father! Come out with me. Father, come outside! Father Choe! You know what will happen if you stay here. Come outside. You probably should go to the hospital. If today is that day, then I have to stay here. You're being stubborn. Those people are here! It's not time for a church service. You might be doing a good deed, but this causes a problem for us. The Father is leaving. Sister. If you believe in God as a priest, then a mother... will believe in her child. I am still a mother. Whether it was 25 years ago, or if it is today. Take care of yourself, Father. Let's go. Sister! Father, come on, come on. Every 25 years. Ji Won. Look at mom. You must get past this. If you're sad, then cry. If it hurts, it's okay to hurt. I miss Ji Won. I didn't stay with him. Our Ji Won... the Holy Mother will take good care of him. Hyo Jae. Hyo Jae! This... How can this be? This is too much. What? Hyeong? Hyo... Hyo Jae! Don't be afraid. Who are you? My son. Hyo Jae. I've been looking for you. I've looked so hard. My son. Let me touch your face. Look at your mother's face. Smell my scent. Mom. Mom! Ji Won. Hyo Jae! Open the door! Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae! You must give this to your mother. Don't ask why. Make sure you give it to her. Also... you must not tell anyone you saw me. What happened? Did you just scream? I never took care of you. Hyeong. I will take good care of you. Ji Won. Let's go see mom. Dad. Ji Won's in his room. Dad. You should not have been here from the beginning. How could I be your father? Don't keep calling me "Dad." You killed my son. You! You killed Ji Won. No I didn't, Dad. Get out. Who are you? Stay away! What do you want? Stay away! Just a moment. I said get away! Mom. I'm your son. I'm Hyo Jae. Look closely. It's me. It's me. It can't be. This is impossible. I prayed sincerely. I prayed this day would come. How can you still have this? Look at me. You still look just the same. Mom. There is no time. Why? Father! Father, please spare me! Husband. What's going on? What's wrong? What's wrong? Mom. Let's calm down a little. Calm down. You are both the same. Put the knife down, okay? Shut up! Do you think I don't know? You both planned to run away after you killed my son. What are you doing? Huh? Husband, what are you doing? Husband! Move away. Husband. Husband. Mom! In order to see my mother today, I have been waiting 75 years. All the people who live here are all trapped in time. Time is unknown in here, and we're not aware of each other's existence. Every 25 years, only in November, a time gap will slowly open up. On the 11th day, the door of time is completely open. Each of our time lines begin to overlap. This house... is such a place. Today, I want to take you back to that time in 1992. What happened that day? You... saved me. I did? Yes. That's why I'm like this, and live in here. This time, you can't do that. To die in that time, that was my destiny. Because of me, your life fell apart like this. your life has sunk so low. Just so I could tell you not to save me, I came here to find you. Mom... don't you want to recapture your lost life? I think... I would like everything to be the way it was. I have also thought about my own life. It has been like being in hell. I was so wronged. Mom, don't do that again this time. Please spare me. You killed my son! Everything will stop now. Hyo Jae. Mom! You can't, Mom. You must not. Mom! Mom! Hyo Jae. This is my fate. I love you. My son. Thank you for coming to find me. Stop. Who are you? I'm sorry. You can't touch that child. You... Hyo Jae. Hyo Jae. My child. Mom. Hyo Jae. I have to leave now. Mom, don't go. Husband. Hyo Jae! If I pray really hard... will I not die as young as Dad? No matter what happens, I will make sure you are cured. It's all right now. Come here. Mom! Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae! Hyo Jae! It's very hard to believe, isn't it Father? It's very hard to believe, isn't it Father? To be honest... it is. He's still very upset. Hyo Jae. Jun Ho? Yeah. Hyo Jae, I won't be here much longer. I have to go someplace far away. Where? Can't I go with you? It's too far. Someday. Someday you can go there. You are the most important thing to me. Way back then. Right now. And in the future. Father. Father. Who is this child? This child is that criminal's son. What? The one who went missing 25 years ago. That son. Didn't you go in there alone? At the end of a very long journey, he has come from the past to the present. Wow, Father. You're pretty funny. That priest is weird. Father, this is my final confession. I... am a sinner who killed her husband. Soon I will go to be with our Heavenly Father, and pay the price for my sins. Hyo Jae, has a hereditary heart disease. It may be shameless of me, but still I beg you to take him and save his life. Take him somewhere they can cure him. So that Hyo Jae will be able to see this beautiful world, please help him, Father. Please do that for me.
