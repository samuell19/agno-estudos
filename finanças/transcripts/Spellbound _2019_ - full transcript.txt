Porte de St-Ouen Please be patient. La Fourche. Service is suspended on line 13 due to a serious passenger incident. THE SPELLBOUND Use alternative routes. Apologies for any inconvenience. The doorcode's changed. How come you're here? Metro's down. They told us to get off. At La Fourche? No, Brochant. You're in Paris? A studio in the suburbs. I wound up... I mean, I teach near here now. Great. It's good to see you. Same here. We're walking on eggshells. I think of you sometimes. Good way? Bad way? It varies. And now? Now I think... The day I first mentioned her, I should have sewn my mouth up. Would have hurt. Less than it hurt later. Morale's high, I see. My morale's not too bad, most of the time. Is this your first time back this way? Yes. I'm meeting someone, I have to... I have to go, you know. I'm going this way. Alright. Morning! A glass of water, please. How are you? I know, I've packed it on. When I can't sleep, I eat. 3 kg in 3 days. I like it. Sure you do. You were even chubbier at school when I fell for you. Fat, you mean. It didn't stop me blowing you in the toilet. We were young. Young and sad. Coffee's still hot. No, thanks. Water. What brings you here full of nostalgia? You look as bad as I feel. You're in a bad way? Over Luc? Where is he? Supposedly, at college. He never goes, so Leonora blames me. You know what she's like. I bumped into Simon. Simon? This morning, outside my old place. By chance? Yes. I mean, in one way, yes. You talked? A little. How was he? THREE YEARS EARLIER You're not pissed off. I don't like shoes. What do you like? Lots of things. I like blue. I like grapes. I like ice cream. And I like roses. I like gray hair. My father has gray hair. My father's bald. I don't like him. How come? Let's not talk about it. Talk about what you like then. I like blue, ice cream. Grapes too. No, really. Really, I don't know. Nothing, really. You know, I have no personality. Don't be silly, guapa. Of course you do. It's like the tongue in your mouth. The what? The tongue. Most of the time, you hide it. But at some point, you need to show it. You must push it out. I don't show my tongue. And when you make love? What kind of question is that? You make love with your tongue in? Tongue out, guapa! Then you're truly naked. And it's beautiful. Come on! Now you hate me, right? Yeah. But I like your tattoo. I have two more bagfuls to do. Two weeks, working non-stop. I can see you Admit it, you don't despise the idea. - She terrifies you. - Me? Your fear of ridicule is the reason sales stagnate. Paralyzed by seriousness. If I wasn't here, we'd tank. You look pulped. I had insomnia last night. Insomnia, good topic. It affects millions. Because of a spider. - Phobias, another topic. - Covered in our March issue. - Luc? Pass him over. - It's not him. - Show me. - It's my divorce. Need the money? A big electricity bill to pay. We're down to the bare bones. I can't help you. Hold on, how about a coffee? - No, thanks. - A chocolate? Have a chocolate. Feature of the month, you feel up to it? Watch out, it's nothing like a book review. It's storytelling. - Sorry. - All good? He's an asshole. Feature of the month. You're the boss. You're so keen on it? Yes, I believe in it. Not just because I know him. Who's "him"? His name's Simon. All I can say is, I wish I had a son like him. That's nice for Luc. Luc's a kid. Simon's a man. An artist. The real deal. Anyway... His mother died six months ago. Just when it happened, he saw it. What did he see? His mother's ghost. Okay. As bad as him. Sorry. Get out, both of you. No, really. I can... No, not anymore. What is it? It's me. Open up. What's wrong? There? He scared you? What scared you? I had sheets to dry. I put everything in. When I switched it on, there he was. Who was there? My father. Sitting there. Looking at me with an angry expression. Sad. Like he's asking me for help and I can't help him. He's in Paris? He hasn't left Huelva for 20 years! You saw us talk. He was in Huelva. How'd he get to Paris? - I gotta finish the laundry. - Let me help you. I knew it couldn't be. But it was so real. I go forward to hug him and say, "Daddy, what are you doing here?" He disappears. Gone. What do you mean, gone? Nobody there. Nothing. He's dead. You good? Not car sick? How's Leonora? She seems keen for your story to be told. She really liked my mother. As a kid with issues, she helped me. - She's a child psychiatrist. - What issues? I got over it. Now she helps me professionally. Meaning? Introducing me to people in Paris and so on. I hate Paris. And people. You've been living here long? Forever. - So you're a journalist? - Not really. - So what do you do? - Blowjobs. I mean, odd jobs. Different jobs for the magazine. Usually, book reviews. But this time feature of the month. Promotion then? If it's published. It's a tryout. They won't even cover my expenses. - I'm not complaining. - No. Underlining your determination. Here. Thanks. You smoke? No. Unless you have weed. I don't take substances. Tobacco is a substance. You want to debate it? Let's get cracking. Now? It's why you're here. Taping? Yes. So before telling me what happened, can you talk about your mother? What can I say? Everyone claims to have the prettiest, kindest mother. The sweetest. Right? She really was. She loved nature and plants. That's how she met Evesco. - She did her garden. - And your father? No father. When I was a teen, my mother fell for a guy. We moved with him to Grenoble. I went off the rails. As soon as I could, I came back. I had asthma. Since Grenoble. You have asthma and you smoke? It's a problem for you? I never get attacks here. I'm sorry. For the dumb comments. Dumb questions. I got no sleep last night or on the train. If I could crash for ten minutes... Ten minutes? A power nap. There aren't any spiders? We're in the mountains. Toilet. An old web. What time is it? Sorry, I just crashed out. You were tired. Can I get some food? I haven't had a bite all day. Wine? No, thanks. We can resume whenever you want. It's late. I'm wide awake now. I meant for me. Cute tattoo. You're an expert. A friend of mine has the same. We got them together one day after taking substances. I observed you earlier asleep. You'll keep it to yourself? I mean, not mention it. Off the record, as they say. What? You watching me sleep? I wanted to sleep with you. I got over it. It might come back. Thanks for warning me. I wanted to kiss your feet. Your breasts, your butt. Do lots of stuff to you. Don't get me wrong. It's the solitude. Nobody comes here. Except the odd migrant crossing from Spain, lost in the mountains. What entitles you to tell me this? My slip of the tongue earlier? What slip of the tongue? This being my second bottle. - Isn't it obvious? - No, not at all. It's not a pretext to get me interested in your wild sex life? I shocked you? Anyway, I'm in no mood for it. Or all the rest. You never fuck? For some time, no. You don't enjoy it? Who's interviewing who? No need to reply. I'm just being curious. I haven't only had fairytale love stories. I'm happy going without. Lucky you. What's that? My mother's ghost. What do you think? It's Haize Hegoa. - What? - Wind from the south. Haize, wind. Hegoa, south. I'd best go to bed. Raid the fridge. Goodnight. I'm not into being watched at work. Coffee's in the kitchen. She was standing in that exact spot. Your mother? I wondered why she was here. I walked toward her... And? Gone. Disappeared. Unlike you. I'll disappear if you want. Impossible. You're alive. So you think. Come on, you're alive. Azar, it's me. I'm still in the mountains. The Pyrenees. Seeing Spain opposite made me think of you. I hope you're holding up. And you'll be back soon. I head home tonight. I'll tell you all about it. Lots of love. All my love. I was wrong to agree to this interview. It was stupid of me. Don't take it personally. I got nothing done earlier. I'm distracted. I drank way too much last night. I was talking bullshit. Shall we just go for it? Sure, get it over with. You'll change the names. Of course. And no photos. I hate photos, especially with that. Alright. I was wondering, were you scared? Scared? When she appeared, no. Surprised, yes. When she disappeared, I was scared. What did you do? I called home right away. No answer. An hour later, I got a call to tell me she'd just died in ER. What had happened? A stroke. I thought she'd live for ages. Longer than me. Since then? Since then, what? No other manifestations? No other signs? Household objects have inexplicably moved. No! Nothing at all. The mist has lifted. It's magnificent! I think she'd have liked you. Me? Your mother would have liked me? She regretted what she called my "savage side." Not seeing me with someone. She'd have been pleased to know you. Thanks, I'm very touched. You don't want to marry me? You could live here. You can work here. There's internet and stuff. Well, let's go back to the interview. What if I'm serious? Don't you like me? I don't know you. - Before, people didn't know their fianc√©. - Precisely, before. Well then? Well what? You eye my ass when I'm asleep. Next thing it's love and marriage. It's bullshit, honestly. I scare you? Why? Because you have visions? You're not alone. A friend had the same thing happen to her. It's why I came, in fact. The friend with the tattoo. She's a painter too. Or an illustrator. A real artist, like you. And much prettier than me. She's the one you should marry. Arm like this? Sure? Sure. That's just fine. Can I get some? No, don't smile. Any news of your guy? What guy? Him? Not at all. Evesco invited him for the issue's release. Like you. You didn't come either. That's not my scene. His neither. I loved your article. Thanks. I had news. Through whom? Your boss. Evesco? Leg! She sent me an email yesterday. She wants me to meet him. So does he apparently. And you? It feels kind of funny. He's in Paris on the 15th to see people, I think. She suggested we do lunch. - All three of you? - No, him and me. You're free? I'm out of the loop. I'd rather you were there. Where's your lunch? I chose the closest. Le Wepler. What are you doing? Whoa, be nice. - Will you be much longer? - You're angry? No, I'm... I'm just cold. And getting pins and needles. The 15th's our editorial meeting. She chose it on purpose. Join us after. I'll see. Sylvain! When you're down, what do you do? Beats Ayurvedic massage, believe me. I'd no idea you're religious. Was. I was a choirboy in Rouen. At the cathedral? No, a small outlying church. What's wrong? What's your take on Evesco? She's rude. I think she's manipulating me. - On what basis? - I don't know. A gut feeling. You're anxious? No, I'm scared. Scared? Of what? I don't know. Won't you light a candle for me? If you tell me why. You know. You know everything. I'm an open book. That's what makes me ill. Alright, make a wish. Join you guys for coffee? Thank you. What are you doing here? Leonora gave me your address. She did? Didn't you, haven't you... What's going on? I'm sorry. What's going on? Nothing. Why didn't you tell me you were in Paris? Know the one about the matador entering the ring? And there's no bull, no ring, nothing. No. It's always the same. Seeing people I have nothing to say to. Evesco's sweet. But she's no art expert. I don't do modern art, I don't do installations. I have no market value. I'm nothing here, zero. That's nothing to do with me. - You're mad? - We might never have met. True. That would have been dumb. What are you doing? Why didn't you tell me? Talk! Superstition. If I had, lunch would screw up. - She told me. - Exactly. It all screwed up. You were so keen to see her? We experienced the same thing. Reading your piece was a buzz. Like my story mattered. I never gave a shit till then. That's down to you. Your writing. Like reading a novel and I'm the hero. And she's the heroine? Why'd she bail? No idea. Better things to do. Could be. You knew why? She's home. If you want to see her, let's go. Why bother her? After she stood you up? I want to bother her. So, nobody home. Another time. - Yes? - Hello. - I wanted to see Azar. - She's out. Sorry, who are you? And you? I'm her sister. I'm a friend. I live opposite. You live in the south-west? - She told you about me? - Yes, when your father... - He was your father too? - Yes. I'm sorry. I'm Coline. Pilar. Simon. Ari, it's not your wife. What did Azar tell us? - What do they want? - Do you care? - To know where she is. - How should I know? - She didn't say earlier. - No, she was in a hurry. She gave us the keys, that's all. So, Azar spent all afternoon at the printer's and swore she forgot all about lunch. She was run off her feet. You believed her? She swore it was the truth. My theory is she was scared about seeing him. And it was the same for Simon. He left the same afternoon. So your two chumps never actually met. Sure... Sure, they met. You never told me. I never told anyone. He suggested I go down to visit. As soon as I could, I got tickets. I thought it was an opportunity for them, too. What time do we arrive? 16:47. It's long. He'll drive down to pick you up? To pick us up. And drop you at your sister's. My half-sister's. You're beautiful. You look happy. So we'll meet on a train station platform. That's not bad, a station platform. Sure. It's romantic. How will we find him? At Biarritz station, it's hard to miss each other. Impatient? Yes! That much? No, I'm just... Interested. Solitude makes the word decisive... What else am I but the terzo incomodo, the third wheel? Simon, it's me. We missed our train and caught the next one. We arrive at 18:50. Lots of love. Yes? I know it's dumb but it wasn't my fault. I could have called earlier but we had to run for it. And fight for them to change our tickets. What do you call this? 18:50. Lots of love. I dreamed of my father. I was in his house in Huelva. In my room, next door to his. And I heard him calling me. It was exactly his voice. Loud. Clear, joyous. Azar! He wanted me to help tie his laces. So I got up, yelled I was on my way. And I woke up. Voicemail. What can have happened to him? I don't know, I don't get it. I'll be going. Wait a bit longer. We can't keep waiting. It's silly. I'm tired. I have a headache. My sister's expecting me. I'll rent a car. Have you got an aspirin or paracetamol? So... See you tomorrow? What will you do? Wait a bit longer. Or else take the bus. Sure? I can drive you. - It's hardly on my way but... - It's two hours out of it! For a nutjob like him. Don't say that. Feeling better? There must be an explanation. I'll never see him. - You guys have a good trip? - Yes. You're alone? Hello? Did something happen? She didn't come. - She didn't catch the train? - Sure, she did. Is she here or not? Where is she? Coline, what is this? Tell me! What the hell happened now? She isn't here, that's all. I'll explain in the car. Are you hurt? I don't think so. Ok, we didn't miss the train. I didn't tell her and I pretended. We waited for you, then she went to her sister's. Why did you do that? Stand up. Why did you do that? I know, it's really mean. I'm not judging, I'm asking. I got scared. Of what? Her? No, of you. You have so little trust in me? Remember when we first met? I told you she was the one. Now she must think I'm a real bastard. - Where did she go, you said? - Hendaye. Her sister's. Call tomorrow and explain. Hold on... I feel terrible. I can't wait till tomorrow. I can't do it over the phone either. - I need to see her. - Now? - Not simple, are you? - I'll take a taxi. Hendaye will cost you. I'll drive. No, definitely not. I messed up, I make amends. I don't want you mixed up in it. Take my bag? Hold on. Why not string me along like her? Why do you think? Keep me posted. - It's fine, it doesn't matter. - No, nothing matters. Thank you, goodbye. Not there either. You called everywhere? Pretty much. If she'd had an accident, we'd know. Let me. You wrote about her visions and stuff? I bought the magazine. You got played, honestly. Her story's so made up. No, I don't think so. I saw her just after. She was... Shaken. Terrified even. Yeah, terrified. You got played. Azar always had great imagination. Always knew how to get love as a kid. She's an artist. She needs publicity. I forgive her. But I'm shocked she used dad's death. She didn't know he was dead, she found out just after. I was there. Like hell she didn't know. Of course she knew. Sugar? No, thanks. You look tired. You can take her bed. Any news, I'll wake you. Still nothing. I can't stand it. I'll drive to Biarritz. There's only one road. What kind of car was it? What color? A four-seater. White. I didn't note the make. White, ok. I'll come with you. Fuck it! She was in a good mood? Why? Could be, she went drinking and dancing, met a guy... And I can go to hell! I let her go with a headache. It was a sign, right? I missed it. It doesn't feel real. When did it happen? Last night, most likely. 10-15 minutes after she left the station. While I tried like an idiot to come up with a story for you. No, it's not possible. Why isn't it possible? It can't have happened like that. Why not? I have something to tell you. Yes? I saw her last night. What are you saying? She came here last night. Here? You saw her here? Where you are now. Apparition. What? You saw an apparition. Like your mother. No, it was nothing like it. Nothing at all. She was alive. How do you know? - I know. - You touched her? I told you, she was alive. She stayed a while. A good while. When did she arrive? I don't recall the exact time. Maybe a half-hour after I got back. Around 11. She just rocked up? She knew the address, she was sure you'd be home... Apparently. You weren't surprised? It didn't really occur to me. It was so... Good? Yes, it was good. Why did she come to see you? Did she say? She didn't have to. So we'd meet at last. Clearly. Very clearly. What did you talk about in the good while together? Not much. Nothing, actually. Nothing? We looked at each other. For how long? I don't know. I guess, maybe 20 minutes. 20 minutes? Are you kidding me? - Relax. - How'd she get in? - She knocked, you opened up? - I was drawing. To take my mind off stuff. I was focused, looked up and there she was. Simon... It was open, she walked in. Sure. You're right. She used to do that a lot. - Really? - No! Are you out of your mind? Who does that? - Nobody normal, nobody alive. - Calm down. How do you know it was her? You never saw her. Same tattoo, right? She had a red leather jacket on. Was that her or not? So you looked at each other... Sure it's weird. How'd she leave? Same way she came, I guess. She stood up and left. I didn't stop her. And? Car engine? Footsteps on the gravel? It was windy last night. It was not windy. Beautiful, wasn't she? Yes, she was beautiful. She was alive. Quit getting stuff like this into your head. Her seizure came later. What difference does it make now she's gone? I'll never talk to her again, never see her again. You're up? Couldn't sleep. Got you this by the river. By the river? Down the hill. There's a river down there? Far? A bit of a hike. You'll take me? It's not so easy to get to. There are better spots. Coming? I don't get it. What? If she came to your house... She came to my house. To get to her sister's, there's no reason to go back to Biarritz. It's way longer. She should have gone via Ustaritz or Espelette. And we'd have found her on the D932. Or maybe the D918. Not the D911. So she went via Biarritz. She's not local, so what? Nothing. So, nothing. That's Spain over there? Yes, that's Spain. What am I doing here? I don't get what I'm doing here. No, really. We're so unalike. I'm nothing like you. If you're so sure... You're offended? I offended him. Poor little painter from the mountains! Sorry. Tell me to jump and I'll jump. Why'd I tell you that? Wrong answer. You're a complete maniac! A maniac! So I count for you? I kind of count for you. We hardly know each other really. I told you, we don't need to, to live together. No, that's not what you said. What did I say? It doesn't matter. I read it. Go easy on the adjectives. Besides that, great. I have some cuts. I'll get back to you. How's the weather in Paris? Shit. Without you, it's shit. Promise me you won't move down there. I'll come back. You're going to wed? Make babies? He's a good fuck? Come on, Sylvain. Butt out! You knew what men are like. Impatient and superficial. And women? You know full well, babe. In love, total idiots. What would I do without you? You just had the counterweight a bit off. Morning. Hi there. It'll go like a charm now. See you next week. Miss... You went back to the river? Last night. Why? Where were you? Looking for wild flowers. Autumn flowers. No luck. What's that? A migrant must have slept here. Via Spain, headed north. And that? Rotten shoes. They look like... Rotten shoes. You're staying? Can we go back? Hold on. Soon it's magic hour. Come on. When daytime wildlife has turned in, before nocturnal wildlife comes out, something happens. Something strange. The gurgling of the water goes quiet. Where were you? Where did you go? To do what? Nothing. Down the hill. I took too long, sorry. A problem? Too much to drink. Fuck you. Go on, go to bed. I don't need you. Stupid to sleep here. You'll freeze to death. Yeah, it's stupid. I am stupid. I feel stupid. You treat me like I'm stupid. Tell me what's going on. I'm lost. Anyone home? Morning. I didn't think it'd be so easy. GPS, whatever people say, is a wonderful invention. You're never alone. Even here, the sky has an eye on you. Coline told you about me? Her best friend. Her oldest friend even. And chief editor. Yes, she told me about you. Beautiful! I came from Paris, going to San Sebastian, Bilbao, etc. - Second honeymoon with my babe. - Alright. He flew but I don't fly. I thought, two birds, one stone. I arrived early in Bayonne, I rented a car and here I am. Alright. I'll go get her. Thanks. I brought some rum and limes. Limes here are a queer idea, right? It popped into my head. Great. I'll be right back. Thanks! I didn't picture it being so remote. I can't find her. I feel like I'm imposing. It's fine. Simon, truth be told, I'm a little worried about her. Why worried? She missed her deadline. It's unlike her. You know what a deadline is? I have a vague idea. Deadlines and limes. Here, they have a curious resonance. I guess that's why she didn't send her text on time. She blanks me on Skype. She won't take my calls. No contact for days. She's well? Just great. What are you doing here? You don't check your messages either? I'll see you out, Sylvain. Come on. You want to talk? You'll go straight to San Sebastian? You're being polite or concerned about me? You mean a lot to me. So much you're kicking me out. Don't worry, it's fine. I can cope. - You're happy here? - Yes. Truly? Come with me? I'm not on honeymoon. He left. I'm chasing after him. Acting out Verlaine and Rimbaud... A dumb idea, but you need protection from that guy. You're insane. Where'd you get it? Is it loaded? Give it back. I have the craziest ideas. Yes, you have the craziest ideas. You scare me. - Give it back. - No. - Come on! - I can't let you have it. I'll throw it away. I promise I will. You promise? Drama queen. Yes, I said. Stay where you are. - Can we talk calmly? - I'm very calm. - You're drunk. - But calm. Stop. No closer. Back off! - What did I do? - Your smiles... Your caresses, your shitty tenderness. Your lies. Keep it all. - My lies? - Yes. I felt it long ago. Tonight, I knew for certain. Totally, absolutely. Put it away. Knew what? When we were dancing, it wasn't you. It was your body but it was empty. You weren't with me, you were with her. You're with her. - Is that it? - Yes, that's it. We're agreed she's dead? - Dead and buried. - No. Buried maybe, but not dead. For you, she's alive. More alive than me or anyone. Don't move! - Stop. - Another step and I do it. - You know I can. - Stop. Maybe it's what I should do. That way, you'll see me too. You don't know what you're saying. Put it away. I know one thing. You see her every day. Every day and every night. And it fills you with joy. So much you can't even hide it. And what then? So what? So what, what? So what if it's true? Thanks for admitting it. No, I said it to... I was playing along. Please, get in the car. I can leave you. It hurts but I can do it! I can also stay with you. What I won't do is share you. Share me with who? With what? You're talking about a dead woman. She's dead! She's dead! You love her. More than anyone else ever. She does what she wants with you, she's possessed you. What can I do? I'll leave you two together. - Coline, stop. - Leave me alone! Hello, it was me who called. I'd like to go to Bayonne station. Yes, sure. Please! Hold on a second. Since the night I met Azar, you got this idea I saw her dead. Like a delusion. It's delusional. You're deluded. I didn't think it was so bad. I don't know how I can help you. Besides say how much I love you. I love you. Good try, thanks. Best of luck. And the gun? Where is it? You kept it? Coline, just give me an idea, you were 20% sure? 50%? Or 100%? 150%. And now? I don't know anymore. So you think it was a delusion, too? I think it's reassuring, your past tense there. It's all in the past? I don't know. I don't know. You still think about him? I never stopped thinking about him. The number you have dialed is no longer in service. To reach your party... Hello. I know. What do you know? Thank you, Sivane. Why are you here? I don't want to bother you, just ask if you have Simon's new number. Simon's? Yes, I'd like to get back in touch. You haven't heard? Heard what? My poor darling... - What? - Sit down. It's dreadful. But he hadn't been with us for so long. I wouldn't say he was unhappy but... You've lost me. I saw him this morning. This morning? What time? What difference does it make? I saw him, we talked. But it happened this morning. What happened? Near your old apartment. He jumped in front of a Metro. At La Fourche. You came for the Sanfermines in Pamplona? What are the Sanfermines? The bull run on Saint Fermin's day. It's well-known here. You know the joke about the matador, who enters the ring? And there's no bull, no ring, nothing. No. What's the joke? That's it. Subtitles: Simon John Subtitling: M141
