Hey, look, you want to buy a guitar? I got one. All right then, do me a favor. Will you loan me $20? I don't think so. All right, I got an idea, man. Why don't you keep the guitar until I pay you back? That way you're safe. I'm not a pawnshop, sorry. Arnie, please, man. I need to get straight here. What you need you don't pay for. You got to pray for it. Arnie, I don't need a fucking sermon right now, okay? I need to get well. All right? Man, you know how it is, right? Please? You're in for a real fucking treat now. You know, you're lucky you caught me when you did, man, because this is my last bag. All right, Snake. Let me see the shit. This is all you got? It's enough, man. It's 90% pure. Where you going to find 90% pure on the fucking boardwalk? This guy's got a shitload of it. Picasso. You want me to hook you up with him, you just say the word. Oh, yeah, baby, here we go. Yeah. Hey, where's this Picasso at? There he is. My man, Picasso. What did I tell you, man? You stay here, all right? Picasso, my man. How you doing, man? Let me get two, okay? Now, listen, now, let me pay you tomorrow, okay? No, man! No fucking way! Come on. Come on. You know I'm good for it! I'm going to fucking cut you! Fuck! Shit! We've got to get rid of him, man. Let's dump him in the river. His body will wash out to the ocean. Come on, man, help me out here. Fuck! Joey? Joey, is that you? Joey? How did you get in? Did you bust that door? No, I didn't bust the door. What are you doing? I told you I won't have drugs in this house. Get that stuff out of here. Joey, what happened? I just got in a fight, that's all. With who? I don't know. It doesn't matter. Fucker pulled a knife on me, so I got out of there. Jeez, Joey, when are you going to learn? I have learned, all right? I am tired of it, okay? I am fucking tired of it. I know I've got to stop this shit. I know. You've heard it all before, right? More than once. Ma, I'm trying to talk to you, and that's what I get? You want to talk? Here's a quarter. Go call your father. Tell him how much you've changed. You know what? I don't know why I fucking bother. Okay, all right, so tell me, what makes this time different from all the other times, huh? Coming around here telling me things will be different, because the only difference I ever see is my money's gone, or my watch and my jewelry are missing. Ma, this is different. If I don't stop this shit, I'm going to die. I know you heard it before, but I am tired of it. If I can get away, maybe I could just clean up. I don't know, go some place like Key West. Remember when we went to Key West? Yeah. That was a fun vacation. I know. The drug counselor says I'm not allowed to give you any more money. Ma, I don't want your money. I just want you to believe me this time. You don't believe me. No, Joey, listen. It's all right. I got to go, all right? No, Joey. No. Joey, no. Mom, I got to go. LaMarca. Hello? Hello? Hello? Who is this? You must have something to say. Hello? Oh well. I was here. You missed a chance for a good talk. It's the middle of the fucking night! You either talk to me or get off the fucking phone. Ouch. Vincent, is that you? Oh, Michelle, sorry. I thought it was a nut calling. Oh. The thunder woke me up. You watching the storm? Uh, yeah. Yeah. You want company? R-row. Be right down. I think we ought to put a hole in your floor and get a fire pole. You got a thing for firemen? Uh-uh. Cops. Cops? Mm-hmm. Good, I'm a cop. Prove it. I'll show you my badge. No. Okay, Reg, I got 0617 a.m. and we're on the scene. They had to beep us out of bed at this hour? The recently deceased would've waited. You got the tide. Another hour, the tide's going to float him to Jersey. Jesus. He looks like a fucking human comic book. Where the hell's the medical examiner? Late for the party, as usual. I'm not waiting. We'd better start before the tide gets him. No ligature marks. Some bruises and contusions. Look at this. Bingo. Let's see what we got. Guy's in a hell of a fight. Look at the defensive wounds. All ones, fives. 20's the largest in here. This is 3,000, 4,000 bucks. He's a fucking dealer. They went after his dope instead of his cash. Good morning, gentlemen. So this is the guest of honor? Where the hell have you been? Don't give me any of that shit, Reg. I had to jerk off twice this morning just to get my heart started. Here we are. Robert Monroe, 414 Seacrest Drive, Long Beach. Huh. Long Beach. City by the sea. You know this guy? No, it's been a long time since I've been in Long Beach, but I wouldn't have forgotten him. Is this going to be a problem for you, Vince, us driving out there? No. When I was a kid, everything out here was brand-new. Everybody had just bought their first car, their first house... Their first wife. Now look at it. looks like the Serbian Army came through. Must've been a real nice place. It was. I'm here to see Lieutenant Katt. Vincent LaMarca. Sam, how are you? This is my partner in Battery Division, Reg Duffy. Sam Katt. Sit down. Putting on a little weight sitting behind that desk all day. So, what brings you back to Long Beach? We got a floater, name of Robert Monroe, about 25, probably a street dealer. 414 Seacrest Drive. You got anything on him? No, but we can do a run on him. Jean? Spelled M-O-N-R-O-E? Lieutenant Katt? This is Dave Simon. He sits at your old desk. Hey, Reg Duffy. So, I thought you'd be retired by now. You got the time. I don't know what else to do except be a cop. It's a bullshit job. He doesn't believe that. It is bullshit. Sure, there are better-paid gigs around, but personally, I wouldn't give up my job. Bullshit. It's their favorite word in Manhattan: bullshit. He didn't talk like that when he was here. This was paradise. I thought maybe I could fool myself. Why'd you leave, Lieutenant? Okay, he's got a lot of trespasses, some burglaries and assaults. Last year, he did six months on Rikers Island for misdemeanor possession. Street dealer. His alias is "Picasso." Well, Sam, thanks. It's good to see you. It was good out here for a while. It was nice to meet you. Good to meet you. Hey, Vince. Come back anytime. Dave will get you whatever you want. That didn't go too bad. He seemed okay. Katt's always been one of the good guys. Never fuck with a family of cops. They don't forget. Hey, come over this Sunday. Marge thinks you don't like her no more. You know I love Marge. It's the kids, then? The little bastards. The kids are great. Respectful, well-behaved, not like you. No, I mean, you got a lot of love in your house, and when I go there, I always feel uncomfortable, you know. But thanks for the invitation. Suit yourself. You'll miss it when it's gone. ¶ By the sea, by the sea By the beautiful sea ¶ ¶ ...by the sea by the beautiful sea ¶ ¶ You and I, you and I oh, how happy we'll be ¶ Hey, sweetheart, give me a cup of coffee. Coming right up. Hey, Snake. Spyder. Want to lend me some money, man? What? I got no money. What gives you the idea I got money? Hey, did you hear? Some wacko fuck wasted Picasso last night. Cut him up real bad. They found his body in the city, by the river. That's bad, man. So I hear that you and Joey went shopping last night. I hear that Joey Nova's Chevy Nova got parked over in Crystal Park. At least, it sounds like Joey Nova's. Next thing you know, my associate, Picasso, seems he ain't breathing too good anymore. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? No. See, the truth of the matter is I can't let this pass, man. I can't let some fuck waste my man and walk off with my bread. I'm a laughing stock. Who the hell is going to work for me, I can't protect my own people, right? It's about respect. The way you're acting, I feel like I already lost your respect. So where's Joey Nova? I don't know, man. Where's Joey Nova? He's in the back, man, in the toilet. ¶ By the sea, by the sea by the beautiful sea ¶ You're dead, you junkie cocksucker! You hear me? You're dead! How you doing, Herb? Can't eat, can't sleep. A good shit is the adventure of my day. I got a little present for you. When are you going to marry that girl in 3A? Who said I wanted to get married? Then I'll marry her. You'll be my best man. Sure, only if you have a nudist wedding. Good night. Good night, you guys. See you. Hi, Terri. Hey, happy anniversary, Vince. Oh, Shut up. Bye. What's she mean, anniversary? You've escorted me home from work every night for almost a year. I have? Well, you missed a couple nights here and there. I have a tendency of turning things into a habit. Oh, I'm a habit, huh? Yeah, you're all over me like a nun. What is the first anniversary, anyway? Is it paper? I don't know, something cheesy. Cheesecake? Is that what it is? Yeah, cheesecake. Let's go have some cheesecake. That's a good idea. What? I was just thinking. About what? About what happens next. Well, we spoon until you fall asleep, then I go upstairs, catch a few winks, I get up at the crack, go to work, come home... Have a beer, make dinner... ...make dinner, watch TV, then head over to the theater and walk you home. Good. If I'm a good boy we make love. If you're a good boy? Yeah. And then you ask me what happens next. That's very good, very smooth. In your own words, taking your time, give us a clear idea what happened between you and this guy on that night, hmm? So Joey Nova owes me money, and he's going to connect me with this guy, Picasso. He's going to talk Picasso into giving him some dope so he can step on it and sell. So we drive through this hurricane looking for him, and we find him down by this refinery. Joey goes up to him and says something. Picasso pulls out a knife, and Joey goes off on the fucker, I mean, way off. I'm, like, "what the fuck is this?" Joey Nova, is that his real name? That's what people call him. He drives a Chevy Nova. What are you doing here, Snake? What do you mean? You don't know the meaning of guilt, and you're not what I would call a concerned citizen. So why did you turn yourself in? To rat out your pal? Joey Nova is crazy. He pulled a knife on me last night, said he was going to cut me up if I didn't keep my mouth shut. So you're going to give us Joey. Where do we find this Joey? He's usually hanging around on the boardwalk by the old casino. I don't know. Suppose we pretend we believe this fuck. You want to get a description of this Joey, what he looks like? I'll run a make on the Nova registration. The only reason why I think you're here is 'cause you're scared. You look scared to me. What I want to know is who you're scared of. You want to tell us? Here's your change and your order. Bye, now. May I take your order? A bacon cheeseburger and a blowjob. How you doing, Gina? Fuck off. That ain't no way to treat a customer. What do you want? I'm looking for Joey Nova. Shit, like I know where he is? Like I care? Tell him I want my four grand back. Oh, he owes you? Good luck. Would you just get the hell out of here? How's your kid doing? You're going to get me canned, asshole. All right, catch you later. We've got to get a search warrant. It'll take a couple of days, and he'll vacate the premises. Oh, bingo. Stinks like a sewer in here. Look at this. It's a shooting gallery, for chrissakes. This is where this guy comes to juice himself. Anybody home? We got special delivery! Ice, Blue Bellies, Snow Caps, Quills, whatever. Hello? Anybody home? Hello? No buyers. I guess not. I think they're all dead. Let's get out of here. This place used to be beautiful. My old man used to take me here all the time. That's the first time I ever heard you talk about your old man. Hey, Gina. What the fuck are you doing here? I just wanted to come take a shower or something. Did you kill that guy? What? What guy? The guy you stole the four grand from. What did you do with the four grand? I didn't steal four grand from nobody. That's not what Spyder says. Spyder? Yeah, the guy worked for Spyder, and your friend Snake turned himself in. Oh, fuck. Oh, yeah. Oh, fuck. I didn't mean to do it. He came after me. I didn't take his fucking money. Joey, what have you done? Are you staying clean? Trying. Gina... Joey, you've got to get out of here. Spyder's been hassling me looking for you. All right. What are you going to do? I don't know. I've got to get out of here. Maybe get some money and then maybe I'll go to Key West or something. Then I could send for you. I don't have the dough right now. Joey, I'm skimming the register at work just to get by. No, that's all right. I didn't mean from you. Yeah, sure, Joey. Here. Here. No, no. Look. I got this for you. So maybe I'll see you in Florida. All right? Bye. Here you go, Herb. Don't let the cops catch you drinking on the sidewalk. It's okay. I got connections. One of them lives in the building. A nice guy? He's an asshole, cheap with his liquor. Vince, Long Beach got a positive I.D. on the Chevy Nova. It's registered to Joey LaMarca. My Joey? Yeah. Would you open up four, please? Hey, Snake. Come out here for a second. You know who that is? Joey Nova. This the guy who killed Picasso? Yeah, Joey Nova. You got anything to add to what you already told us? No, sir. You stuck him, didn't you? No, I didn't. Joey did! Get in the fucking cage! Come on, Vince. Lieutenant, you all right? Joey's my son. His mother and me are divorced. Jesus, sir, I'm sorry. Put a warrant out for him. Get a search warrant for that casino where he's supposed to hang out on the boardwalk. Keep checking with Traffic for the Chevy Nova. I'm going to go see his mother. I'll call you. Cover the back, just in case he's in there. Okay. Who is it? It's Vince. Can I come in? Maggie, I'm sorry it's late. What do you want? You know where Joey is? He's in trouble. I think he might've killed somebody. You know this, or you just think it? I'm pretty sure. Listen, I know a lawyer, he's very good. He used to be with the D.A. Really? I'm going to give him a call. So, let me get this straight. You walk out on him 14 years ago, and now you come back in here giving orders like you own the place? Maggie, our son is in big trouble. We don't have a son. I do. You don't have anything. Nothing here belongs to you. Learn a new song to sing, please. You walked out on Joey. I never walked out on him. I walked out on you. What's the difference? Maggie, I'm trying to help. Oh, don't pretend like you care. You came here to arrest your own son. Yeah, if he's responsible, yes, I will. He'll have to face up to it. Funny, you talking about facing responsibilities. Where were you, you goddamn coward? You always ran away. Anything got too close, you ran to your job and hid. Just tell him he's better off turning himself in to me. You think I trust you to bring him in? You wife beater! You have to bring that up, don't you? You had just as much to do with what happened as I did, and you know it. There was never any violence in my family. Nobody ever hurt anybody, not like the LaMarcas. Well, if he knifed a man, you can't save him by saying it runs in the family. He made a choice to be there and to kill, just like you made a choice to be a goddamn bitch. Okay, Vince, you got it off your chest. Nothing more to say now, right? So go. Just tell him he's better off turning himself in to me. Hey, where you been? I thought you got shot or something. I'm sorry. I should've called. Are you all right? Rough day. Is something wrong? No, just tired. I just don't feel like... I just don't feel like talking. Okay. Okay. Chief. Close the door. Assistant Police Commissioner Johnson, and Vanessa Hansen, mayor's office. Actually, Deputy Assistant Mayor. Take a seat, Vince. We just wanted to meet you, see how to spin this for the media. Spin what? They know about your old man, Vince. We need to have a story to explain how the son of an executed child-murderer was hired and promoted to homicide detective. One of the best. One of the best. Of New York's finest. My father didn't kill the kid. It was a stupid accident. Everybody knows that. It's ancient history. Yes, but the 11:00 news will be all over this, and we want to be ready. The first thing they'll want to know is how you got into the department. Wait a minute. I didn't kill the kid. But you were hired by a Police Captain McAuley, your father-in-law, who shepherded you into Homicide? What are you saying about him? This is the very guy that arrested my father, and he took a big chance with me. Oh, I know. I'm not asking anything. I'm just saying that this is how the media will frame it. After they executed my old man, I was a kid with nothing. The only thing that saved me was that cop. He was the kindest guy I ever met. Why don't you make that part of your story? How's this? "Detective LaMarca is in no way responsible. "He's had a long and honorable career, living down the tragedy of his father's violent past." My father wasn't violent. What is this? Would you excuse us? ...criminal behavior, blah, blah, blah, something kind of like that? You see what I'm up against? I have to take you off the case. I should reassign you too, Reg. Let him stay. I want him on it. It's your call. I don't know. I want Joey brought in safe, and I know you'll do that. Okay. All right. Rossi! You're working with Reg on this. You take the rest of the week off. I don't need a week off, sir. This isn't a democracy, Vince. I'll give you a lift home. Put my ex-wife's place under surveillance around the clock. A wire tap, too. Reg... he may have killed a guy. It gets easier the second time. What I'm saying is if it should come to that, you'll always have my respect and friendship. I'll do everything to bring him in safe. You want company? How come you're not at work? Took a few days off. I'm not used to seeing you in the daylight. I look different? Look, I'm sorry about yesterday. I'm sorry I didn't call you. Well, we're not in high school, right? I just had a tough day, you know? No, actually, I don't know. I just don't like talking about work, that's all. Okay. You got your place, I got mine. No complications, and that's okay. I'm 43 years old, I like to keep it simple. I don't want to marry you, Vincent. I just want to know you. Sometimes I think I know you, and then something like that happens and I realize I don't know you at all. You going to say anything? What's there to say? It's my problem, not yours. Why make it yours? You see? That's exactly what I mean. What's up, doc? Check it out. I got something for you. How much you looking for? At least a grand, man. I need some traveling money. Yeah? Where you going? Florida. What you going to be doing down there? Well, my old man, he manages a hotel down there. He's going to get me a job tending bar. One of those beach bars, you know, palm trees, right on the fucking sand. I'll give you a grand for your Chevy Nova. How am I going to get to Florida? I can't sell my Nova. I love that car. This is all shit. All right, listen. Look, I got a silver-plated .45. Bring me the piece. Then we'll talk some money. I'll see you later. Dude, we never close, baby. Yeah? Mr. LaMarca? Joey LaMarca's father? Who's this? Friend of Joey's. Who are you? I'm Gina. Okay, come on in, Gina. Sit down. You want something to drink? No. So, where's Joey? I don't know. You don't know? When was the last time you saw him? I got something that belongs to Joey. I was thinking I'd leave it here with you. It's just stuff Joey saved. Kind of like a scrapbook, you know? How did you know to come here? Joey brought me once, one day he said he wanted to see you. And where was I? I don't know. He chickened out. Wouldn't even push the doorbell. Just like Joey, he wouldn't let me either. How do you get in touch with him? I told you. I don't know where he is. You want to keep asking me questions like that, you're going to have to read me my rights. You live in Long Beach? Yeah. I borrowed a friend's car to get down here, so I have to get back before she has to go to work. You drove all the way into the city just to give me this? Joe's gone. That stuff was real important to him. I didn't know what else to do with it, and his mother don't like me, so... So, what do you expect me to do? Just, like, be his dad, you know? I've got to go. I'm going to get a ticket. Gina? Thank you. Sure. I'll talk to you later, okay? Cheesecake? That you? That's me. Mom, dad? Yeah. Connie. His name was Angelo. He's handsome. Yeah. My old man was executed at Sing Sing in '59 for murder. I was eight. What happened? He was a moving man. He used to move these rich people into mansions out in Locust Valley. One way or another, he got himself into debt. I guess it was pretty bad, because he came up with this idea... this brilliant, idiotic, stupid idea. Kidnap a baby from a rich family. Leave a ransom note. They'll pay, no sweat. So he kidnaps the baby, and while he's waiting for the ransom in his car, the baby gets tangled up in a blanket in the back seat and he suffocates. First time they had a murder in Long Beach, and it was my old man. You were just a little kid then. It must've been hell. Yeah. You get through anything when you have to, but it was... anyway, the only thing that kept me sane was the cop who arrested my old man kind of adopted me. Captain McAuley. He was a good guy. But this... this the ex-wife? Yeah, that's Maggie. Who's this? That's my son, Joey. You have a son? Yeah, I'm sorry. I lied to you when I said I didn't have any kids. I'm sorry. Why did you lie to me, Vincent? I don't know. I hadn't seen him in a long time, and the divorce was a real mess, and Maggie had been seeing this guy, and, well, I don't know, I just... I lost control of the situation. What's that mean, lost control? What's that, cop talk? We used to fight a lot with shouting and yelling and all that stuff, but it never got physical, and then one day it did. I lost control, so... I, of course, regretted it, and... but we never got over that. On top of everything, I think my son might've killed a guy in a fight over drugs the other night. What? I'm just trying to tell you everything. Yeah, okay, okay. Why haven't you seen him? Well, I tried at first, but Maggie made it very difficult. I could only have these supervised visits with a social worker watching me, like I was a criminal. It was like I was back going to prison to see my old man. I couldn't take it, you know... So you just stopped seeing him? Well, not just like that. I mean, Maggie was also doing a number on him so he didn't really want to be around me, and I just walked away, I quit. Maybe I should've tried harder. I don't know. Why couldn't you tell me this before? Well, I... I don't know, I... That was me. With you, it's different. It's like I'm the real me. I didn't want to ruin that. Are you all right? Yeah. It's what I asked for, isn't it? Not so simple, huh? No. No, it's not. Vincent, I'm not your ex-wife. I'm not going to judge you. I never have. I won't start now. I've got to think about this. I've got to think about this. See you, okay? Gina, I want you to know I've got a lot of respect for you. The way you got your shit together for your kid. I got no problem with you. Just tell me where Joey is, and I'll leave you alone. I don't know-- Don't! I don't want to hear it. I'll tell you what. I'll give you till 12:00 noon. That'll give you plenty of time to feed your kid, take a shower, do whatever you got to do. But after that, you find Joey, okay? Yeah. He's a good-looking kid. LaMarca. It's Gina. I need money to pay the taxi. All right, I'll be right down. You okay? No. It's 52 bucks. Just give him 60. He's a nice guy. Who's this? Your grandson. I try not to smoke around him. Sometimes it's just, you know... What's his name? Angelo. Look, we haven't eaten anything. You got maybe something we could eat? Yeah, I'll make you something. Does Joey help you out? He would if he could, I guess. How do you pay your rent? I'm on Workfare, flipping hamburgers, until they figure out I've been dipping in the register, which is going to be any day now. Then I'll be totally fucked. When did you see him last? Night before last. He said he was going to get some money and go. Go where? Like he knows? Florida, Key West, I don't know. Whenever he gets rabbity, he's going to fly away to Florida. Like it's some magic country, when it's the fucking dope capital of the world. Can I ask you a question without you getting mad? Depends. When you left Joey, was it hard? Very hard. You miss him? Of course. It get easier, you know, missing him, after a while? You just stop thinking about it. Just lock it out. Put your head down, just keep walking, otherwise it'd be too difficult. Was it better for Joey, you think, you know, that you left him? For a while, but I know I missed out on stuff. Like what? Like teaching him about things... like about good music, about old movies, not being afraid to fight, stuff like that. Yeah. I guess what you want and what you can do is totally different things sometimes. Gina, I want to help Joey. You can't help him. You never did. That's what he says. Hey, I'm going to go out to buy some smokes. Can I borrow a couple of bucks? Yeah, my wallet's in the hall on that table. You need anything? No, thanks. You don't mind watching Angelo for a bit? He'll be okay. Hey. You be good, honey. Mommy's going to be right back, okay? His Pampers and stuff are in the duffel. Huh? Duffy. Reg, it's Vince. My son's girlfriend brought over my grandson, Angelo. Vince, can you hear me? Yeah, listen. Hello? Hello. It's a lousy connection. Look, she came over here spooked about something. She just went out for cigarettes. When she comes back, I'll turn up the heat. When she comes back... We're heading to Long Beach. I got a search warrant for the casino. You want me to come meet you there? Vince? Vince? Reg? There's Mommy. Atta boy. Who's this? This is my grandson, Angelo. Joey's kid. His mother just dropped him off. I didn't even know he existed. Huh? Listen, Vincent. I brought your keys back. I think maybe we need to take it easy for a while. Why don't you come in for a second and we can talk? We've got to talk. Come on. We should talk, you know? LaMarca. I didn't go out to buy smokes. Gina, what's going on? Look, I've been thinking, you know? Um, I've been thinking about scoring. Look, I'm sorry I took your money. Forget about the money. Just stay where you are. Let me come get you. Just, I'm going to go away for a while, okay? Gina, don't do this. You're going to regret it. Angelo needs you. A kid needs his mother. Don't do this. Please. Look, he's better off without me. No, that's not true. That's not true. Please. I'll come get you. Where are you? You did it. Maybe I'm like you. I just can't do it. Look, you want to stay in my apartment, you can stay here, or I'll get you your own apartment, but just come back, please. You're going to pay for it. It's a big mistake if you do this. Please just come back here. Listen a minute, okay? Would you just listen to me? Joey might be crashed up at the old merry-go-round by the boardwalk, okay? He's going to be up in the attic. You won't hurt him, right? Of course I won't hurt him, but, Gina, please. You can't leave him. I'm sorry. You know, I tried. I'm sorry. She's not coming back? No. She told me where Joey was. Can you... Take care of him? Yeah. Can't say no. Look, Vincent, I came here to give your key back and to get mine. Okay, yes. I'll come back and take care of him, too, just let me do this, okay? We'll talk then, all right? We're right outside. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, thanks. We're down here by this casino. Send us some backup. Come on, let's go. You're not going to wait for backup? Fuck it. Vince and I were here already. Let's go see if anyone's there, then get back to town. It's late. All right, easy, easy. This place stinks. Yeah, the lovely smell of humanity. I'm taking my gloves off. I got them fucked up last time. Holy shit, look at all this. Watch your step. There's used needles all over the place. Reg? Shit! Reg? Reg... Oh, fuck! Officer down. Officer down, Long Beach Casino! Officer down! Rossi, what happened? He was up there with a gun. Reg is over there. Oh, no, Jesus. What happened? They called for an assist, but they didn't wait. You don't go in for a murder suspect without backup! He said you and him were already here before alone. Goddammit, Reg. Chief Henderson. Lieutenant Katt, Long Beach Police. Crime scene is in here. Lieutenant LaMarca! Chief wants to see you. Okay. Here's the facts as we know them so far. 45-caliber automatic reported stolen from a veterinarian clinic. The suspect's name is Joseph Howard LaMarca. Wait a minute. Not now. You don't have enough to make Joey the prime suspect. I know it's your kid-- I'm talking evidence. Rossi didn't see the shooter. No, I didn't. He didn't see anybody. You said that Joey hung out up there. Just a lead, it doesn't prove anything. This isn't a trial, it's an investigation. I'm not excluding him. I'm saying you don't have enough to go on to make him the prime suspect. Chief. We got a fingerprint match on the murder weapon. I'm sorry, lieutenant. It's definitely your boy. Yes, Brian, I'm here at the crime scene on this once-popular boardwalk where Detective Reginald Duffy has been gunned down during a manhunt for Joseph LaMarca, a murder suspect police consider armed and dangerous. Vince. They're tearing the house apart. They've got a search warrant. They say Joey killed some cop. Not some cop. My partner. I know what they'll do when they find him. I know what cops do to cop-killers. They'll shoot him or say he fell out a window. They're going to find a way to kill him. It's too late, Maggie. Please, Vince. It's not his fault. Then whose fault is it? Did I pull the trigger? Did you pull the trigger? He doesn't know what he's doing. Don't start with that shit again, please. You pick and choose. Right or wrong. If he's a murderer, he's a murderer, and he's got nobody to blame but himself. Please help him. You're all he's got. Then he's got nothing. Vince, please, help him! Don't walk away from him again! ...Angelo LaMarca, executed for a horrific kidnap murder in 1959. This photograph shows Angelo LaMarca being booked for the murder of baby Chance Frederick, who was strangled to death in the back of the kidnapper's car while LaMarca attempted to collect the ransom money. Marge. Here, Bree, take these into the living room. Come on, now. I'm sorry it was your boy, Vince. That'll be hard for you. I'm sorry. I'm just so sorry. It's hard to believe Reg will never be coming home again. Why did he do it, Vince? Reg never would have hurt him, not your boy. It's just so wrong. It's just so wrong. I swear to God that if there's anything I can do, anything... Bree's going to miss him the most. Detective LaMarca has had a long and honorable career with this department living down the tragedy of his father's violent past and that of his troubled... Hi. Where's Angelo? He's asleep in your bed. Detective LaMarca is still on active duty, although he has been moved to a different case. The big story. I don't know what to say. I'm really sorry, Vincent. I went to see Reg's wife. You know, all the other cops wouldn't look at me, just like at school. Nobody says anything, but you know they're thinking... you're guilty too. You can't blame yourself for everything. Is Joey my fault? I don't know, but you're not responsible for everything your son does. He's got to choose who he wants to be. You think we got a choice? No, we just pretend that we got a choice. It's more like a sentence. When my old man did what he did, I felt so bad, you know? I felt like I was the criminal. No way was I ever going to feel that way again. I was going to be so good that nobody could ever pin anything on me. That was my choice. But now it doesn't matter whether your old man is a cop or a murderer. Bottom line is some kid's father is not coming home anymore. That's the real life sentence. Yeah. So, what do we do, Michelle? You want your keys back? LaMarca. I didn't shoot that cop. Joey? Yeah. Did you hear me? I didn't shoot him. Well, somebody did, I just left a wife and daughter crying their eyes out. Somebody did. All right, well, it wasn't me. Listen to me. Listen. Let's meet where we used to watch the planes. Remember when you were a kid, we used to watch the planes? Yeah. Yeah. Remember where that was? I'll be there, just me. Why should I trust you? Joey, you have no choice. Just meet me there. I'll be there by myself, I promise. You've got to do it, please. All right. You're going to meet him? I hope so. What are you looking at? There's a van down there. They're tapping the phone. But you're on their side. I don't think they see it that way. Speak. Let's not play games, Vincent. Sorry about that, chief. You know you're being tapped. Why get cute about the meeting spot? Because I know what could happen to Joey if the wrong cop got there ahead of me. Vincent, you've got my personal word of honor that nothing's going to happen to Joey. And your word is good with me, lieutenant, and if I can, I'll bring him in to you personally. Now, excuse me, I've got to go. In a couple of minutes, there are going to be a lot of cops up here. Pack up Angelo and bring him down to your place. Where are you going? You can't say what you don't know. I still watch those planes. Yeah. I met Angelo. Gina brought him over. Nice little kid. Because of Gina, not me. She won't let me see him. She says I got to stay away till I get clean, which will be whenever. Joey, I've got this lawyer. He's ready to meet with us. Un-fucking-believable. You want to take me in? I want to help. Did you hear me? I didn't do the cop. I come to talk to you, you bring up a fucking lawyer. You think maybe your lawyer could get me the electric chair? Fuck. Too weird, huh, if I got the chair too, like your old man? Ever think about him? Sure. Did you love him? He was my father. Of course I did. Because somebody is your father means you've got to love him? You think I love you? I don't know. Fucking right. You don't even know me, do you? No, I guess I don't. You want to tell me? You know I was quarterback in school? No, your mother never said. She never told me anything. Yeah. I used to look for you in the stands. You'd never show. I would've loved to see you play. You should have. I was good. We beat Cedarhurst in the County Finals. First time in 24 years. Crowd went wild. I didn't need drugs that night. I was good then. You should have seen me. I wish I had. All right, fuck it, we all got reasons. You believe me about the cop? Your fingerprints are all over the gun. Yeah, I stashed it there, but I wasn't there when that cop went down. That cop had a name. His name was Reg. Okay. So who was there, then? This fucking scumbag dealer named Spyder. He's after me for his four grand. Fucking four grand, man. If I had that money, I'd be on a plane to Florida right now. Did you see him? No, I didn't see him do it, but I saw him right after. Right after, in the alley there. What about Picasso? I don't know. Look, I was fucked up. He came at me with a knife. I guess in a sense I killed him. In a sense? I mean, I don't know what happened. One minute we're fighting, and the next minute, he's dead. But that wasn't me. All right? That wasn't the real me. I wouldn't count on a jury believing that, Joey. This is something you can't run away from. You can't run. Do you believe me? It doesn't matter what I believe. You plead self-defense, you've got a good chance of getting off with maybe six years. What if it matters to me what you believe? I've got to take you in. You know that. What are you, a cop or my father? I'm both. Joey... I'm getting out of here, so what are you now? Joey, come on. I'm just fucking with you. I knew the answer. You know, when I was a kid, I wanted to be a cop. I really did. Just like you. Joey! Joey! Joey! Chief. Where's your boy, Vince? Picasso worked for a dealer called Spyder. Spyder's after Joey to get his four grand back. Joey told me he saw Spyder in the alley by the casino right after Reg was hit. Why didn't you read your boy his rights and bring him in? He told me he didn't kill Reg. And you believed him? Yeah, I did. Of course you want to believe him. Chief, I've been a cop for 25 years. The operative word is "cop." That doesn't mean you're sometimes a cop and sometimes some junkie's father. You're either a cop or you're not a cop. End of story. This is bullshit. Lieutenant LaMarca, you're a sworn officer. Your under oath to perform your duties. In terms of this investigation... What investigation? You already made your mind up. Don't be playing no bullshit neither. It's a motherfucking ghost. How come you're still breathing, Casper? Listen, $1,000 for my Nova. Cops got your motherfucking wheels, boy. Listen, I'm sorry, man. Will you do me a solid here, please? I need help. Please. What's the ring? It's a football ring, but it ain't for sale. Come on, let me see. Listen, this is worth like a hundred, easy, but I'm saving it for my son. Mm-hmm. All right, look, we'll treat it like a loan until I get you the hundred back, all right? Yeah, sure. All right. Here. No, Carl, I can't use this. I need cash, bro. I can't use this. You're the first junkie who couldn't, then. Come on, give me the ring back. Hey, hey, hey, back the fuck off! You're lucky I'm giving your ass anything. All right, but Carl, please, that fucking ring is important. It's for my boy. You ain't going to be around long enough to see your boy. You ain't going to no fucking Florida, neither. You got Spyder and the cops chasing after your ass. You're a junkie. Only place you're going is to the morgue. County, motherfucker! Wait a minute! What are you doing? There's nothing in there for you, mister. Come here. Come over and see my soup. Oh, look, here's Grandpa. Hey. This is Evelyn Hancock. She's an old friend of mine. Hi there. Wow. You're a big boy, Angelo. Evelyn is with Child Services. What's going on? She's taking Angelo until Gina comes back. Just a temporary thing. She's not coming back. I can't take care of him. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, sure. Go see this nice lady. I just want to talk to him for a minute. What are you doing? What am I supposed to do with him? Take care of him. You're his grandfather. That's a nice idea, but come on, I can't. Look, Vincent, Gina is gone. You think his father is coming back? Look, Evelyn will take good care of him. That's the best thing for him. No, you're the best thing for him right now. I can help you if you need me. Michelle, you've never had kids. You don't know what it's like. I can't believe you can just walk away from Angelo. I'm not walking... Walking away? You told me you walked away from Joey. I'm not walking away! That's what you told me you did before. Walk away? Let me show you something. Let me show you something. You think I want him growing up with this? Like he's the son of fucking Frankenstein? Watch out, here comes the LaMarca kid. You never know what he might do. There's LaMarca, don't mention his father! Call it walking away if you want, but I'm doing the best thing for this kid. That is not about Angelo, Vincent. That's about you. You told me. You told me you never had a choice, right? Well, now you've got one right here. Michelle, try to understand. Right now, it's just more than I can handle. I can't do it. That's how you make a choice. Goodbye. I want my mom! If there are no other questions here, let's try to wrap this up, gentlemen. We've got some pretty substantial evidence to go on. Fingerprints are clear and unambiguous, and there are no others on the gun. Shell casings, ballistics, all identify the gun as the shooter's weapon. We know Joey LaMarca frequented the carousel and used drugs there. Excuse me, sir. Go ahead, Dave. There's a shoeprint in the blood at the crime scene doesn't match LaMarca's shoe size. So, what do we think? That O.J. was there? Maybe Bruno Magli? One last thing. This kid has killed twice. Don't give him a chance to do it again. We got that? Hey! You got a phone call. Some putz is calling you on my phone. How come you're giving out my phone number? I don't even know your number, Herb. Well, this guy knows it. Make sure you leave a nickel in the ashtray. Hello? Dave Simon, sir. Tell your neighbor I'm sorry, I couldn't call you direct. Yeah. What's going on? I have something you should take a look at. Could we meet in the city? Corner of York and the 59th Street Bridge? It's copies of crime scene photos I tried to talk about in briefing. What are the pictures? Footprints in the blood, not around the body, but at the top of the ladder. We can account for all of them except one heel and partial sole from a size 10 cowboy boot made by a company called Justin Boots. Now, at your wife's place, we found some of Joey's stuff. Joey wears a size 121/2 shoe, and there's no 121/2 prints anywhere in this blood. I appreciate this. Well, you know, it doesn't all have to be bullshit. You born in Long Beach? Uh, no, sir. Army brat. We lived all over Distant climes, huh? Traveled a lot. Now we got a baby boy, I hardly get out of Long Beach anymore. Kids change everything. Isn't that the truth? Sir, listen, I'm real sorry about your son. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Yeah. Right now, it's more than I can handle. ...pretend we get a choice. We don't have a son, I do. You don't have anything. ...it's more like a sentence. Just because somebody's your father, you've got to love him? You think I love you? Maybe I should've tried harder. You told me you never had a choice. Are you a cop or my father? That's my son, Joey. Please help him. You're all he's got. Please! Help him! He's your son! This is something you can't run away from. Just, like, be his dad. Sorry, sir, we're closed. Anybody know where Spyder is? We're closed, mister. Where's Spyder? Peace, brother, peace. Stick the Friar Tuck act up your ass. Where's Spyder? You know who I am? Yeah, your kid... Tell Spyder I know he killed my partner. Tell him I got the proof. He's interested in seeing me, I'm at the Seaway Motel, room 105. You got that? Yeah. 105, Seaway Motel. Here's where we're really expecting the storm to hit. On our weather map, lots of green, and embedded within that, yellows and reds. These are the areas where we're expecting a lot of heavy rain. Right here in New York City, heavy rain moving in by early tomorrow morning. You got something for me? Dave Simon. Lieutenant LaMarca. Got it. Okay, I want backup and emergency units to the corner of Ocean and Neptune. Lieutenant Katt! Don't fucking move! Don't move a finger. Give me the gun. Give me the fucking gun! Go ahead. Move! What the fuck is this? What do you think you're doing, telling people I shot that cop? I know you killed my partner, you scumbag. No, it was your junkie kid that popped him. Seems I'm not the only one that thinks so, either. You're the one that left a footprint in his blood. Those Justins, size 10? You're a long way from Manhattan, cop. But too close to home for you, huh? You broke into my property, fucker. I'm well within my rights to defend it. I couldn't take the chance he'd hurt Gina and Angelo. That would be just like him, the fuck. You broke in here pretty good. You learn that in cop school? So what now, Joey? Huh? Hold back and hold your fire! Hold your fire on my word! Put your eyes on that corner and on that door and windows! You, right there, block off that road! I don't want to see one goddamn TV van in here! Right up there. Okay, enough. Give me the gun. It's going to be hard enough getting you out of here alive without them seeing that. This is no game, son. Please. You saved my life, but that doesn't matter to them. They didn't see it. they don't care. I ain't going to jail. I know. Look, I understand. I want to help you. Just... just give me the gun. Lieutenant LaMarca, signal to us your location. All right, go ahead, talk. Talk? What are you now, fucking Oprah? We could stop all this. You got a son and a woman that loves you. Don't run away from that. You did. Yeah, I did. And I'm sorry. I've regretted it ever since. We've all got to pay one way or another, right? What's going on, Joey? It's called suicide-by-cop. Quick and easy. No pills, no fucking around. I thought I'd try it. How did we get this way? I remember the day you were born. I remember the day you left, so we're even. I'm not going kill you, son. Well, your friends out there will. You know it. Hold back! Hold your fire! Get the building secured! Look, give me the gun, Joey. Stay back. I don't want to shoot you. You think I deserve it for what I did to you. Get fucking back! But you won't, because it's not the real you. You don't know the real me. Yes, I do. You're my kid. You're not a bad kid, you're not an angel, you're just a scared kid whose old man left him. You didn't get a choice, and it hurt like a motherfucker, I know, but you're still my son, and you always will be. Then why did you leave me? Because I was stupid, afraid, and I forgot what it felt like to be left alone. That's why you can't do this to Angelo. You don't want to do to him what I did to you and what my old man did to me. You can't do that. He don't need a junkie for a father. You're not a junkie to him, same as my old man wasn't a killer to me. You're just his dad. When my old man left me, I hated him all my life for what he did to me, I hated him, but if I'm honest, what I really wanted was for him to walk in the door, because I missed him, and I didn't want to be left alone anymore. We all pay a price for what we do, and that's right, but when's enough? Because I paid and you paid, and what? Now Angelo has to pay? You can't. We got a second chance here, me and you, because I let you grow up thinking you didn't matter to me, but I swear, no matter what, I won't run away again, Joey, I swear. I'll stay with you, I promise. You just need to choose it. You need to choose it for yourself. You know how many people would love a second chance? Help me. Joey! Joey... Dad! Dad, are you all right? I'm okay. It's just my shoulder. I didn't do it. I know you didn't, Joey. Get rid of the guns. Empty your pockets. Don't give them an excuse. Dad, they're going to kill me. It's okay, it's okay. I'm with you now. Identify yourself! It's okay. It's okay, no guns. Raise your hands. Raise your hands. See the hands? No guns. Get down, drop the gun! We're down. We're down. The hands are here. Move away from him! Take it easy with him! Take it easy! Anything happens to him, then you'll answer to me. Easy with him! Easy with him! He's going to be all right. It's okay, son. It's okay. I want to go on the rocks. Yeah, those are the rocks. That's the jetty. Let's go on the rocks. Yeah, those are the rocks. Look, see that? You see that, the airplane? See? Where do you think that's going? You want to fly away with your dad sometime? Yeah? Because he wants to go with you. He told me so. He told me he wants to take you to Key West. You want to go? Yeah? Good. When he comes back, you'll go with him to Key West. Me, you, and him. Grandpa, Daddy, and you, we are going to go to Key West. Okay? Okay, sweetheart. You want to put the water in the thing? Go put the water in the thing. ¶ Red sails in the sunset Way out on the sea ¶ ¶ Oh, carry my loved one Home safely to me ¶
