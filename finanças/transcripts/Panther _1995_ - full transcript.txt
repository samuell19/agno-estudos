[Panther] CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY POLYGRAM FILMED ENTERTAINMENT ? WE SHALL OVERCOME ? ? WE SHALL OVERCOME... ? Malcolm X: THERE IS NOTHING MORE DANGEROUS THAN TO BUILD A SOCIETY WITH A LARGE SEGMENT OF PEOPLE IN THAT SOCIETY WHO FEEL THEY HAVE NO STAKE IN IT, WHO FEEL THEY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE. PEOPLE WHO HAVE STAKE IN THEIR SOCIETY PROTECT THAT SOCIETY, BUT WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE IT, THEY UNCONSCIOUSLY WANT TO DESTROY IT. [CHANTING] WE WANT KING! King: I AM CONVINCED THE MOST POTENT WEAPON AVAILABLE TO OPPRESSED PEOPLE AS THEY STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM AND JUSTICE IS THE WEAPON OF NONVIOLENCE. WE ARE NONVIOLENT WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE NONVIOLENT WITH US. BUT WE ARE NOT NONVIOLENT WITH ANYONE WHO IS VIOLENT WITH US. THIS IS AN UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY. YOU ARE ORDERED TO DISPERSE. GO HOME OR GO TO YOUR CHURCH. THIS MARCH WILL NOT CONTINUE! NEXT WEEK, I SHALL ASK THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES TO ACT, TO MAKE A COMMITMENT IT HAS NOT FULLY MADE IN THIS CENTURY TO THE PROPOSITION THAT RACE HAS NO PLACE IN AMERICAN LIFE OR LAW. [GUNSHOT] Malcolm X: WELL, ANYTIME YOU LIVE IN A SOCIETY SUPPOSEDLY BASED UPON LAW, AND IT DOESN'T ENFORCE ITS OWN LAW BECAUSE THE COLOR OF A MAN'S SKIN IS WRONG, THEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE JUSTIFIED TO RESORT TO ANY MEANS NECESSARY TO BRING ABOUT JUSTICE WHERE THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T GIVE THEM JUSTICE. [GUN COCKS] [GUNSHOT] Judge: THE BLACK PANTHERS. PEOPLE STILL ASK ME HOW IT ALL STARTED, HOW THINGS WENT SO FAR. AND LIKE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PANTHERS, THERE ARE DIFFERENT ANSWERS, DIFFERENT BEGINNINGS. WHAT BECAME THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF DEFENSE REALLY STARTED WITH 2 GUYS, BOBBY SEALE AND HUEY NEWTON, SAYING 2 WORDS-- "DEFEND YOURSELVES." STORY HAS IT THAT THEY HOOKED UP AT SOME COFFEEHOUSE WHERE BOBBY WAS RUNNING DOWN A RHYME. OH, YEAH. IT'S EASY TO SEE... RIGHT ON YOUR BLACK AND WHITE TV. BLACK MAN. BLUE COP. RED BLOOD. BROTHERS WATCHING OTHER BROTHERS DIE. OH, MY. THAT'S THE AMERICAN WAY. WHAT YOU DOING? HEY, GET HIM OFF ME. SETTLE DOWN, BLACK BOY. Judge: THE POLICE THREW THEM BOTH IN JAIL. YOU KNOW, THE MAN IS CONVINCED HIS FOOT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR ASS. YEAH. BUT FUCK THAT. DIG IT. FUCK THAT. Judge: THERE THEY STARTED TALKING ABOUT BLACK FOLKS OUGHT TO START STANDING UP FOR THEMSELVES. NO MASTER PLAN. NO POT TO PISS IN. NOTHING LIKE THAT. JUST 2 FED-UP BROTHERS. NEXT THING YOU KNOW, BAM. YOU GOT THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF DEFENSE. ONE OF THE FIRST MEMBERS TO JOIN WAS LITTLE BOBBY HUTTON. WHAT'S HAPPENING? AND THAT GOT THE BALL ROLLING. [SIREN] ? WHOA! ? ? I FEEL GOOD ? ? I KNEW THAT I WOULD, NOW... ? Judge: BUT FOR ME, IT STARTED DIFFERENTLY. [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS] ? SO GOOD ? ? SO GOOD ? ? I GOT YOU ? ? WHOA! ? ? BERNADETTE ? ? PEOPLE ARE SEARCHING FOR ? ? THE KIND OF LOVE THAT WE POSSESS ? ? SOME GO ON ? ? SEARCHING THEIR WHOLE LIFE THROUGH ? ? AND NEVER FIND THE LOVE ? ? I FOUND IN YOU ? ? OOH ? ? AND WHEN I SPEAK OF YOU ? ? I SEE ENVY IN OTHER MEN'S EYES... ? [GASPS] LOOK AT YOU LOOKING. WHAT YOU LOOKING AT IS ALMOST 30 YEARS OLD, BUT THIS HAT IS BRAND-NEW. GET YOURSELF ON TO SCHOOL, BOY. YES, MA'AM.

GOD DAMN YOU! HOW COULD YOU DO THAT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER HERE? WHAT'S HAPPENING? WHAT'S HAPPENING? Judge: LIKE I SAID, FOR ME IT STARTED A LOT DIFFERENTLY. YEAH.

I'M ASKING YOU ABLE BLACK ASSES TO COME DOWN AND BE OBSERVERS ON THEM COPS. TAKE DOWN SOME BADGE NUMBERS. THEY DON'T PULL A LOT OF SHIT WHEN TOO MANY EYES ARE ON THEM. Y'ALL CAN HELP NOT BY PRAYING BUT BY WATCHING. YOU THINK THE POLICE CARE ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE PRAYING? THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS STOPLIGHT PUT IN SINCE BEFORE MY MOTHER WAS A VIRGIN. YOU THINK CITY HALL REALLY CARES ABOUT A BUNCH OF BLACK PEOPLE HAVING ANOTHER PRAYER VIGIL AT SOME GODDAMN CHURCH? THEY AIN'T GOING TO HAVE IT AT CHURCH. THEY GOING TO MARCH TO THE INTERSECTION, A PEACEFUL PROTEST. I AIN'T FUCKING WITH NO COPS. THEY DON'T LIKE US GETTING INVOLVED WITH NO POLITICAL SHIT. SOME OF US FEEL WE SHOULDN'T EVEN INTERACT WITH THE WHITE MAN. WE ARE AFRICAN, BROTHER. MOTHER AFRICA'S THE ONLY SALVATION. LOOK, YOU PHONY-ASS BOOJY NIGGER. WE AIN'T IN AFRICA. WE IN OAKLAND. IN OAKLAND WE GOT POLICE BRUTALITY. WE GOT THE WHITE MAN INTERACTING HIS BILLY CLUB UPSIDE THE BLACK MAN'S HEAD. IF THAT SHIT DON'T BOTHER YOU, TAKE YOUR SKIRT-WEARIN' ASS BACK TO AFRICA.

WE MADE HIM GET HIS MA'S PERMISSION BEFORE HE JOINED. 16? HE'S JUST A KID, MAN. COPS KICK THE SHIT OUT OF KIDS, TOO. ? WE'RE FIGHTING FOR OUR FREEDOM... ? Judge: THE BLACK COMMUNITY WAS A FAMILY, A STRONG FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. THE GHETTO WAS NEVER HEAVEN. WE HAD OUR CROOKS AND DRUNKS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT EXPLOITING US. AS LONG AS WE SUFFERED IN SILENCE, THE AUTHORITIES LEFT US ALONE. ? WE SHALL NOT BE MOVED... ? BUT... THAT SILENT-SUFFERING SHIT WAS ABOUT TO CHANGE. YOU SAID ALL THE PANTHERS WOULD BE HERE. WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET. THAT'S BOBBY SEALE. AND THAT-- THAT'S HUEY. SHIT, AIN'T TOO MANY OF YOU MOTHERFUCKERS OUT THERE. HEY, MAN, IT ONLY TAKES A SINGLE GRAIN OF SAND TO MOVE THE WORLD. ?

WE MUST TURN THE OTHER CHEEK, BROTHERS. OH, MAN. TCH. REMEMBER, THE MEEK SHALL INHERIT THE EARTH. WAIT, WAIT, HOLD. LOOK, FELLAS, WHAT WE NEED TO DO... IS PRAY FOR THEIR FORGIVENESS. THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO. HEY, NO OFFENSE, REVEREND, BUT THEY BEEN PRACTICING ON US FOR 400 YEARS. THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY DOING. BROTHER MALCOLM SAID WE NEED TO STOP SINGING AND START SWINGING. Y'ALL CAN RANT AND RAVE, BUT IT'S THE POLICE WHO GOT THE GUN. SHIT, IF BLACK FOLKS HAD GUNS, WE'D PROBABLY SHOOT EACH OTHER WITH THEM. AW! TCH! LORD, WHY DON'T THEY SHOW US NO RESPECT? BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO. THEY THINK THEY CAN BRUTALIZE US AND LOCK US UP WITHOUT A JURY OF OUR PEERS 'CAUSE WE'RE IGNORANT TO THE LAWS. WE NEED TO ORGANIZE, KEEP OUR SHIT CORRECT, AND EXERCISE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AS CITIZENS TO DEFEND OURSELVES AND ARM OURSELVES. THEN IF THEY TRY TO BRUTALIZE US OR VIOLATE OUR RIGHTS, WE GOT A RIGHT AND MEANS TO DEFEND OURSELVES. WHAT THE HELL THE BOY SAYING? THE MAN SAID WE CAN CARRY GUNS. IT'S LEGAL. THAT'S RIGHT. Y'ALL GOING TO GET GUNS AND SHOOT COPS? NO, IT AIN'T ABOUT SHOOTING COPS. IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE MAN'S ATTENTION AND SHOWING OUR COMMUNITY THAT WE AIN'T GOT TO TAKE THIS SHIT NO MORE. THE ESTABLISHMENT, IT DON'T LISTEN WHEN WE SING, PRAY, OR BEG. BUT THEY SEE SOME DISCIPLINED BROTHERS WITH GUNS, THEY'LL KNOW THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF DEFENSE IS SERIOUS ABOUT DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF OUR PEOPLE. ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE.

REPEAT AFTER ME-- ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE. ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE. NOW, PUT YOUR FIST UP. ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE. ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE. THERE YOU GO. YEAH, I LIKE THIS. Black panther: 9--WE WANT ALL BLACK PEOPLE BROUGHT TO TRIAL TO BE TRIED IN ACCORDANCE... Judge: THE BLACK COMMUNITY WAS STARTING TO SEE THINGS THE PANTHERS' WAY. SLOWLY IT WAS BEGINNING TO SOLIDIFY BEHIND US. BLACK WAS BEAUTIFUL, MAN. FAST, CLASSY, ASS-KICKIN', AND NAME-TAKIN', TOO. Black panther: AS OUR MAIN POLITICAL OBJECTIVE, A UNITED NATIONS-SUPERVISED PLEBISCITE HELD THROUGHOUT THE BLACK COLONY IN WHICH ONLY BLACK COLONIAL SUBJECTS WILL BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE WILL OF BLACK PEOPLE AS TO THEIR NATIONAL DESTINY. GO! ? WE GOT TO GET MORE POWER TO THE PEOPLE ? ? FOR GOD'S SAKE ? ? WHY DON'T YOU GET ? ? MORE POWER TO THE PEOPLE? ? ? 5-6-7, OPEN UP THE PEARLY GATES ? ? WELL, THERE AIN'T NO TIME TO WONDER WHY ? ?

OF COURSE, UH, JUDGE, THIS IS ALL JUST CONJECTURE. LET'S WALK AND TALK. COME ON. HERE'S THE DEAL. YOU HELP ME OUT SOMETIMES, AND I'LL MAKE SURE EVERYTHING STAYS CLEAN. YOU CAN BE A BIG HELP TO YOUR COUNTRY. WE BOTH FOUGHT FOR AMERICA--KOREA, NAM. WE BOTH KNOW AMERICA'S GOT PROBLEMS. IT'S STILL THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, JUDGE. MY FOLKS WERE IMMIGRANTS, DIRT POOR. THEY PULLED THEMSELVES UP BY THE BOOTSTRAPS. YOU BELIEVE ALL THAT, DON'T YOU? I WOULDN'T BE A COP IF I DIDN'T. SOLDIER, WITHOUT LAW AND ORDER, THESE STREETS WOULD JUST BE CHAOS, AND YOU KNOW IT. NOW, LOOK HERE, JUDGE, WE DON'T ASK SOMETHING FOR NOTHING. WE KNOW THAT COLLEGE IS EXPENSIVE THESE DAYS. WE'D LIKE TO HELP OUT. WHAT DO YOU SAY? [SOFTLY] I'M LISTENING. PARDON? I'M LISTENING. YOU DO MORE THAN LISTEN. YOU CALL ME BY WEDNESDAY, ALL RIGHT? THAT NUMBER. OK? A COUPLE OF BUCKS IN IT FOR YOU.

STALL A LITTLE SO THEY THINK YOU'RE FOR REAL. EAT UP YOUR FOOD. GET SOME NUTRITION. TYRONE, YOU THINK FEEDING OUR CHILDREN WILL MAKE THE MAN JUMPY? I DON'T KNOW. SEEMS TO ME BLACK FOLKS IS GETTING MIGHTY UPPITY-- FEEDING THEIR KIDS BREAKFAST, TRYING TO TAKE THEIR DESTINY IN THEIR OWN HANDS. MAKES ME WONDER WHAT THIS WORLD'S COMING TO. OFFICER, NO! DON'T SHOOT! FREEZE, DAMN IT! I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! TURN AROUND NOW! I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING! [GUNSHOTS] THE POLICE LIED. THEY SAID HE WAS TRYING TO STEAL A CAR. MY BABY WOULDN'T STEAL NO CAR. MAMA... MAMA, THESE BROTHERS HERE ARE FROM THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF DEFENSE. I ASKED THEM OVER FROM OAKLAND. I THANK Y'ALL FOR COMING TO GRIEVE WITH US. POLICE WON'T TELL US NOTHING. THEY BEEN SHOOTING BLACK MEN AROUND HERE LIKE WE GOING OUT OF STYLE. LORD HAVE MERCY. MY BOY DIDN'T DO NOTHING. CAN'T SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING? YES, MA'AM. WE CAME TO DO SOMETHING. WHAT DO WE WANT? JUSTICE! WHAT DO WE WANT? JUSTICE! ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE! ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE! ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE! ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE! THE POLICE SAY BROTHER DENZIL DOWELL WAS TRYING TO STEAL A CAR. [MURMURING] THAT HE LEAPED A FENCE AND RAN THROUGH A FIELD OF BROKEN GLASS AND OIL, BUT WHEN WE CHECKED, THE BOTTOM OF HIS SHOES WERE CLEAN. IF ANY OF Y'ALL KNEW DENZIL, YOU KNEW HE WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT, THAT HE WALKED WITH A LIMP. HE COULDN'T HAVE HOPPED ANY FENCE. THE POLICE REPORT SAYS QUITE CLEARLY DENZIL WAS SHOT 3 TIMES, BUT THE CORONER'S REPORT SAYS DENZIL DOWELL WAS SHOT 6 TIMES. 2 OF THOSE SHOTS WERE IN HIS ARMPITS, BROTHERS AND SISTERS. YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS? BROTHER DENZIL HAD HIS HANDS UP. WHAT DO WE WANT? JUSTICE! WE NEED MORE PROGRAMS. THEY'RE IN THE CAR. AMEN, BROTHERS AND SISTERS. LET US BOW OUR HEADS AND PRAY. I MISSED YOUR PHONE CALL. SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS. DON'T WORRY. I'M JUST PLAYING ROUGH COP SO YOUR SOUL BROTHERS WON'T KNOW WE'RE PARTNERS. JUSTICE! WHAT DO WE WANT? COME ON, MAN. NO. IT'S JUST HARASSMENT. WE GOT MOMENTUM, BROTHER. Crowd: ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE. YOU'RE NOT COMING IN HERE WITH NO GUN. THE FIREARM IS IN PLAIN VIEW, THEREFORE, IT'S LEGAL BY CALIFORNIA STATUTE. THIS IS PUBLIC PROPERTY PAID FOR BY THE PEOPLE. OVER MY DEAD BODY. THAT'S YOUR CALL, PIG. WE DIDN'T COME FOR BLOODSHED. WE COME FOR JUSTICE, BUT DON'T BE PUSHING US TOO FAR. BOYS, PLEASE. [CHEERING] Huey: IF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS NOTHING TO HIDE, WHY COULDN'T THE DOWELL FAMILY OBSERVE THE BODY? IF HE BLED TO DEATH, WHY DOES THE CORONER'S REPORT SAY HE WAS SHOT TO DEATH? WE DEMAND A GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION INTO DENZIL DOWELL'S DEATH AND THE PATTERN OF BRUTALITY AGAINST THE BLACK CITIZENS OF RICHMOND. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS CONDUCTED ITS OWN INQUEST AND CONCLUDED THAT NO MISCONDUCT OCCURRED. AS FAR AS A PATTERN OF BRUTALITY, THE CHARGE IS RIDICULOUS. WHAT DO YOU CALL 4 DEAD BLACK MEN IN 6 MONTHS? I CALL IT THE POLICE DOING THEIR DUTY UNDER THE LAW. YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH ANY LAW, YOU TAKE IT TO THE LEGISLATURE. I THINK THE PIG MIGHT HAVE A POINT. GET THE HELL OUT OF MY OFFICE! Brimmer: LOOK HERE, THE LAW'S CHANGING. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO CARRY THEM GUNS MUCH LONGER. WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER, JUDGE? Judge: YEAH. ALL RIGHT. I EXPECT TO HEAR FROM YOU REAL SOON. HUEY NEWTON TAKES A CRAP, I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT. OTHERWISE, I'M GOING TO COME LOOKING FOR YOU. I WON'T BE NEAR AS FRIENDLY AS I WAS TODAY. JUDGE, YOU GOT TO REMEMBER SOMETHING-- YOU GOT A LOT AT STAKE HERE. LOOK, THE PANTHERS ARE GOING TO LOSE. THE ONLY QUESTION IS ARE YOU GOING TO LOSE ALONG WITH THEM? YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR FUTURE, YOUR MOTHER, YOUR LIFE. NOW THINK ABOUT IT. ALL RIGHT, SOLDIER, GO ON. GET OUT OF HERE. GO ON. Bobby: HOW Y'ALL DOING OUT THERE? ALL RIGHT! YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING. JUST AS BLACK PEOPLE START TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS, THE PIGS WANT TO CHANGE THE LAW. WE AIN'T GOING TO MAKE IT EASY FOR THEM TO HAVE NO UNARMED TARGETS, ARE WE? HAVE A GOOD TIME AND ENJOY YOURSELVES 'CAUSE THIS HERE IS YOUR COMMUNITY. IT'S OUR COMMUNITY. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING. THAT'S RIGHT. JUST DO ME ONE FAVOR. SAVE ME SOME OF THAT BARBECUE OUT THERE. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN TO THE BAND, HAVE A GOOD TIME. LOVE YA. ? OH-HO OH-HO ? ? STAND, IN THE END ? ? YOU'LL STILL BE YOU ? ? ONE THAT'S DONE ALL THE THINGS ? ? YOU SET OUT TO DO ? ? STAND ? ? THERE'S A CROSS FOR YOU TO BEAR ? ? THINGS TO GO THROUGH ? ? IF YOU'RE GOIN' ANYWHERE ? ? OOH ? ? STAND... ? WONDERFUL PICNIC. WONDERFUL PICNIC. WHAT A DAY. WE JUST NEED THEM 10 EXTRA GUNS, WE'LL BE STRAIGHT. FOR THE 10 BROTHERS COMING LATER. ALL RIGHT. SOLID. RIGHT ON. HUEY, WE GOT 29 PANTHERS GOING, INCLUDING THAT REPORTER FROM, UH, RAMPARTS, CLEAVER. THAT'S 30. THIS IS GOING TO BE A COLOSSAL EVENT. WE'RE GOING TO TURN THE CAPITAL OUT. FAR OUT, BABY. FAR OUT. COOL IT BOBBY, MAN. WHAT IT BE, BROTHER? YOU AIN'T GOING WITH US, HUEY. WE'RE THE LEADERSHIP, YOU AND ME. THERE AIN'T ENOUGH OF US AS IT IS. THE PIGS DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PANTHERS THERE ARE. IF BOTH OF US SHOW UP, THEY MIGHT PUT 2 AND 2 TOGETHER. WE AIN'T EVEN 100 STRONG, BUT WE GOT THEM GUESSING THOUSANDS. OK. I'LL GO, YOU STAY. OH, NO. WE TOOK A VOTE. YOU'RE TOO RISKY. IT'S DECIDED. YOU STAY. GO ON AND MOW YOUR MAMA'S LAWN LIKE YOU PROMISED. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, I'LL STAY. YOU GO. JUDGE... WANT A BEER? HEY, JUDGE, WHERE YOU BEEN, MAN? I SAW THE PIGS ROUSTING YOU. YOU OK? YEAH, MAN. IT WAS JUST HARASSMENT. MY DRIVER'S LICENSE EXPIRED. PIGS, MAN, THEY BE GRABBING AT ANYTHING. SO WHAT'S THE PIG'S NAME? BRIMMER. YOU GOT TO STAY COOL ON THIS, ICY-GODDAMN-COOL. YOU JUST BECAME THE STRONGEST WEAPON WE GOT. LET ME GUESS. THAT PIG WANTS YOU TO CALL HIM AND TELL HIM WHAT WE'RE DOING. YEP. YOU'RE GOING TO DO JUST THAT, BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT TO FEED THE PIG. YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THIS? YEAH, YEAH, I GUESS. HEY, MAN, DO ANY OF THE OTHER BROTHERS KNOW ABOUT THIS? SHIT'S GETTING PRETTY THICK, HUEY. IT'S GOING TO GET A WHOLE LOT THICKER... FOR ALL OF US. WELL, ISN'T THAT NICE. WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR NAME? GOVERNOR, ARE YOU RUNNING FOR THE NATIONAL TICKET? ARE YOU KIDS ALL FROM THE SAME AREA? GOVERNOR, WHAT ABOUT THE MULFORD ACT? I'D SAY THE SAME THING I SAY TO ALL THE YOUTH. REMEMBER THE 3 Rs-- READING, WRITING, ARITHMETIC-- AND YOU CAN BECOME LAWYERS, DOCTORS. THAT'S WHAT AMERICA'S ALL ABOUT. COME ON, LET'S GO. IS THIS A MILITANT ACTION? ARE THE PANTHERS STORMING THE CAPITOL? ABSOLUTELY NOT. WE'RE HERE TO SEND A MESSAGE. BLACK PANTHER PARTY CALLS UPON AMERICANS TO TAKE CAREFUL NOTE OF THE RACIST CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE NOW CONSIDERING THE MULFORD ACT, AIMED TO KEEP BLACK PEOPLE DISARMED AND POWERLESS WHILE THE RACIST POLICE AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY INTENSIFY THE TERROR, BRUTALITY, MURDER, OPPRESSION OF BLACK PEOPLE. NOW I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU. WHICH WAY IS THE STATE ASSEMBLY? RIGHT UP THERE ON THE SECOND FLOOR, SIR. GOOD MAN. ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE. CALL THE POLICE. CALL THE POLICE NOW. YOU GUYS CAN'T... WAIT A MINUTE, GUYS. YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE. WE'RE HERE TO OBSERVE THE ASSEMBLY. YOU TRYING TO DENY US OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS? MY GOD! CALL SECURITY. DON'T SHOOT US. Radio: 29 ARMED NEGROES STORMED INTO THE STATE CAPITOL TODAY. BOBBY SEALE, THE BLACK PANTHER LEADER, CALLED THE NEW ANTIGUN PROPOSAL RACIST. GOVERNOR REAGAN HAD THIS TO SAY. Reagan: THE BLACK PANTHERS ARE A MILITANT FRINGE GROUP WHO ARE USING FEAR AND INTIMIDATION AGAINST THE OAKLAND POLICE DEPARTMENT. Reporter: THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY MADE A WRONG TURN AND ACCIDENTALLY WALKED ONTO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR INSTEAD OF THE VISITORS GALLERY. THE BLACK PANTHERS ARE NOT ANTIWHITE. WE ANTIOPPRESSION. YOU CAN'T FIGHT RACISM WITH RACISM. Reporter: THE LAW THE PANTHERS BROKE IS DISTURBING THE ASSEMBLY. 26 BLACK PANTHERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN SACRAMENTO. Judge: WE LOST BOBBY. HE SERVED 6 MONTHS FOR TAKING THAT WRONG TURN. THE MULFORD ACT EVENTUALLY PASSED, SO WE LOST THE RIGHT TO CARRY GUNS. ONE THING WE DID GET WAS WORLDWIDE ATTENTION. YEAH, DISCIPLINED NIGGERS MARCHING WITH GUNS, THAT GOT EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION. THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF DEFENSE CLAIMS TO BE THE VOICE OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, ANALYSIS OF OUR FIELD REPORT REVEALS A HIGH LEVEL OF ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS. WE'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE. WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF OUTSIDE AGITATION. BLACK TERRORISTS ON THE FLOOR OF A STATE CAPITOL? I WON'T HAVE IT. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN ORGANIZATION FUNDED AND MASTERMINDED BY SOME COMMUNIST POWER HOSTILE TO THE UNITED STATES. THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHICH ONE? BEFORE WE CRUSH THESE UNGRATEFUL COONS, FIND OUT WHO THEIR REAL BOSS IS. YES, SIR. GENTLEMEN. WE'RE GOING FOR A RIDE. GET IN THE BACK SEAT. WE AIN'T GOT ALL DAY. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THIS PARTY YOU BOYS WERE PLANNING AT THE CAPITOL? THE SHIT WAS SPONTANEOUS. YOU TOLD THE PRESS. YOU DIDN'T TELL ME. REMEMBER WHO YOU'RE WORKING FOR. WHATEVER YOU SAY, MAN. YOU SASSING ME? YOU LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT! I'LL GET YOUR BLACK ASS. SASS ME, WILL YOU? GET OUT OF THE FUCKING CAR! "WHATEVER YOU SAY, INSPECTOR BRIMMER." YOU'RE FUCKING RIGHT, WHATEVER I SAY. I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE YOUR WIRY HEAD'S SCREWED ON STRAIGHT. GET UP HERE. YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT WOULD BE FOR YOU TO DISAPPEAR? ALL THESE DRIVERS SEE IS A WHITE COP AND A BLACK CONVICT IN HANDCUFFS. YOU UNDERSTAND? YEAH, WHAT DO YOU WANT, MAN? I WANT YOU TO GET YOUR ASS OUT OF NEUTRAL. SET THE PANTHERS ON A PLATE FOR ME. SET THEM UP FOR ARMED ROBBERY. THE PANTHERS DON'T ROB NOBODY. THEY DON'T OPERATE LIKE THAT. YOU JUST DO IT. LIKE YOUR MAN SAYS, "BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY." OK! ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT. SOMETHING FOR YOUR TUITION. GET BACK IN THE FUCKING CAR. WHAT'S HAPPENING, BRO? WHERE'S JUDGE? I AIN'T SEEN HIM AROUND LATELY. BETWEEN SCHOOL, HIS JOB, AND THE PANTHERS, HE'S BEEN RUNNING KIND OF RAW. I GOT TO TAKE A LEAK. HEY! I KNOW THIS FOOL AIN'T SELLING DRUGS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. GO ON. USE MY PAD. LET ME HANDLE THIS. I'VE BEEN KICKING HIS ASS SINCE HIGH SCHOOL. I'LL SEE YOU OUT AT THE MEETING, ALL RIGHT? WHAT DO YOU GOT TO SELL? EVERY BLACK MAN AIN'T A DOPE DEALER. WHAT DID HE MEAN BY THAT? I TOLD YOU FOR THE LAST TIME, STOP PUSHING THAT FUCKING POISON IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD! YOU'RE POISONING YOUR OWN PEOPLE, FOOL! FUCK THAT BLACK POWER SHIT! I'M DOWN WITH GREEN POWER AND FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU, ALL RIGHT? DON'T MAKE ME COME BACK HERE, ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT? ? LET'S STRAIGHTEN IT OUT ? ? OOH ? ? LET'S STRAIGHTEN IT OUT... ? CY, IS THAT YOU? I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE, MAN. HEY, HEY, HEY. OFFICER, I WAS-- I WASN'T DOING NOTHING. COME HERE. COME HERE. PANTHERS TURNED INTO SOME REAL SHITHEELS, AIN'T THEY? YES, SIR. THEY'RE GETTING ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY. IF THIS WAS MY NEIGHBORHOOD, I'D STAND UP FOR MYSELF, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. YES, SIR. SAW THE PIGS ROUSTING YOU, MAN. YOU OK? Judge: YEAH, MAN. IT WAS JUST HARASSMENT. MY DRIVER'S LICENSE EXPIRED. YEAH, RIGHT. Huey: ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL, LOOK AROUND YOU. WE GOT NEW MEMBERS JOINING EVERY DAY. NEWLY APPOINTED MEMBERS FROM OUR NEWARK CHAPTER VISITING FROM THE EAST, STAND. I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE ANOTHER NEW MEMBER TO YOU-- THE AUTHOR OF SOUL ON ICE AND A RESPECTED JOURNALIST. I'M PROUD TO INTRODUCE OUR NEW MINISTER OF INFORMATION, ELDRIDGE CLEAVER. YOU'RE ALL WELL AWARE OF THE CHAINS THAT WE AS A PEOPLE BEAR-- THE CHAINS OF SLAVERY, OF SECOND-CLASS CITIZENSHIP. BUT THERE ARE OTHER MORE INVISIBLE CHAINS-- CHAINS OF NOT SPEAKING YOUR MIND, CHAINS OF ALL THE WORDS LEFT UNSAID OUT OF FEAR OF REPRISAL BY THE MAN, THE SILENCING OF OUR BLACK VOICES. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WE HAVE A VOICE, DIG IT? THAT'S RIGHT. I'D LIKE TO PROVE IT TO YOU. EVERYBODY REPEAT AFTER ME. FUCK RONALD REAGAN. I'M SERIOUS. FUCK RONALD REAGAN. FUCK RONALD REAGAN. FUCK RONALD REAGAN. FUCK RONALD REAGAN. FUCK RONALD REAGAN. FUCK RONALD REAGAN. FUCK RONALD REAGAN. FUCK RONALD REAGAN. FUCK RONALD REAGAN. FUCK RONALD REAGAN. FUCK RONALD REAGAN. FEEL GOOD, DON'T IT? YEAH. ALL RIGHT. AMAZING HOW SPEAKING YOUR MIND CAN FREE YOUR SOUL. THANK YOU, BROTHER ELDRIDGE, MINISTER OF INFORMATION. SISTER, HEY. WAS YOU PAYING ATTENTION? THE PIGS MUST HAVE PLANTED HER SO THEY COULD BUST US. I'LL HANDLE THIS. I'M OK. I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. COME ON, SISTER, LET'S GO. AND REPORT TO YOUR CADRE LEADER. DON'T FORGET WE GOT OUR RED BOOK HERE ON SALE. EACH ONE TEACH ONE. WE'VE GOT TO REACH OUT TO OUR BROTHERS ON THE STREET. THAT'S WHAT THE 10-POINT PROGRAM IS ALL ABOUT. BROTHER HUEY, CAN I TALK TO YOU? YEAH, CERTAINLY. ALONE. NOT RIGHT NOW, BROTHER. I'M TALKING SOME BUSINESS WITH THE MINISTER OF INFORMATION. TOMORROW. TOMORROW. OK, SO, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S EXACTLY... CAN'T YOU SEE YOU'RE JEOPARDIZING THE MOVEMENT? THE PIGS ARE LOOKING FOR ANY EXCUSE TO COME DOWN ON US. I DON'T WANT MY BABY TO BE NO JUNKIE. I WANT MY BABY TO BE FREE. THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT. YOU AIN'T GOING TO HURT ME, IS YOU? YOU'RE HURTING YOURSELF AND THAT BABY, TOO. SISTER, YOU GOT TO STOP KILLING US. YOU GOT TO STOP KILLING THAT CHILD. Huey: JUDGE, YOUR INFORMATION IS VITAL TO US, MAN. HOW VITAL COULD IT BE, MAN? WE GOT CHAPTERS ALL OVER NOW. THIS IS PANTHER INTERNATIONAL HEADQUARTERS. THE POLICE WILL START RUNNING GAMES HERE FIRST. WHO'LL STRAIGHTEN OUT THE OTHER BROTHERS WHEN THEY GET ON MY ASS? LIKE THE MANUAL SAYS, "INFORMATION IS DISSEMINATED... ON A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS." HERE'S ANOTHER DONATION FROM THE PIGS. IF THE PIGS KNEW THEY WERE SUBSIDIZING THE PANTHERS... THEY WANT A LOT FOR THEIR MONEY, MAN. THEY WANT A FELONY WITH VIOLENT INTENT. IF THEY DON'T GET IT, THEY'LL KILL ME. IF THEY DO, THE PANTHERS WILL KILL ME. MAN, I HEAR THAT. BUT I WOULD RATHER DIE ON MY FEET THAN LIVE ON MY KNEES. COME HERE. COME HERE. PIG FUCKING INFILTRATOR! EASE UP, SISTER! SELL OUT! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TRYING TO PROVE? THIS BOOT-LICKING HOUSE NIGGER SIGNED UP ABOUT A MONTH AGO. SAYS HIS NAME'S MATTY. I CALL HIM SPY. OH!

I THINK POOR BLACK FOLKS ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR HUMANITY AND POOR WHITE FOLKS ARE FIGHTING FOR MORE MONEY. WHITE BOYS CAN GET A HAIRCUT AND JOIN THE ESTABLISHMENT, BUT US-- WE'RE BLACK FOREVER. SISTER ALMA, SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS. THE FBI's LEANING ON OUR PRINTER LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE TO CANCEL THE CONTRACT. DEADLINE FOR THE NEXT ISSUE OF THE PAPER IS TOMORROW. CIRCULATION IS UP-- 125,000 AND RISING. WE'RE SEIZING THE TIME. THE TIME IS WHAT SARTRE CALLED THE MOMENT THE MATCH IS PUT TO THE FUSE. NOW, IS THE HAND HOLDING THE MATCH BLACK OR WHITE? ALL RIGHT. NO FULL-FLEDGED ALLIANCE, BUT WE WILL ACCEPT THE RALLY INVITATION. RIGHT ON. BROTHER ELDRIDGE, SET IT UP. LOOK LIKE A WARRIOR. HELL, NO! WE WON'T GO! HELL, NO! WE WON'T GO! HELL, NO! WE WON'T GO! A FEW DAYS AGO, WE CAME TO THESE STEPS TO PROTEST. WE WERE 4,000 THEN, AND THE COPS BEAT US DOWN. [BOOING] TODAY... WE ARE 10,000! [CHEERING] 10,000 DIFFERENT VOICES IN UNISON SAYING ONE THING... [TIRES SCREECH] THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE AN IMPERIALISTIC WAR ABROAD AND SOCIAL PEACE AT HOME. SUSPECT JUMPED THE BACKYARD FENCE, HEADING EAST ON MARKET STREET. IN PURSUIT. SO IT IS WITH THIS UNITY, THIS PURPOSE, IN MIND, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN... HE'S CUTTING THROUGH THE PARK. DEFENSE MINISTER OF THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY-- HUEY NEWTON. HUEY! HUEY! HUEY! HUEY! HUEY! HUEY! HUEY! HUEY! THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY'S PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY. [CROWD CHEERS] NOT FAR FROM HERE, BROTHER BOBBY SEALE'S LOCKED DOWN... [CROWD BOOS] A VICTIM OF THE TYRANNY WE FEEL HERE AT HOME. THAT SAME TYRANNY IS AT WORK MANY THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM HERE IN VIETNAM. THANKS A LOT, ASSHOLE. THAT "BLIND MAN" THING WAS REAL CUTE. THE ONLY QUESTION YOU CAN ASK IS... I GOT HIM. THANK YOU, GUYS. WHY SHOULD THE BLACK MAN GO FIGHT THE YELLOW MAN FOR THE WHITE MAN? THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY IS OPPOSED TO THE WAR IN VIETNAM. WE KNOW OUR WAR IS HERE AT HOME AGAINST HARD DRUGS IN THE COMMUNITY, AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT. THAT, BROTHERS AND SISTERS, IS OUR WAR. POWER TO THE PEOPLE! POWER TO THE PEOPLE! POWER TO THE PEOPLE! POWER TO THE PEOPLE! POWER TO THE PEOPLE! POWER TO THE PEOPLE! POWER TO THE PEOPLE! POWER TO THE PEOPLE! POWER TO THE PEOPLE! POWER TO THE PEOPLE! POWER TO THE PEOPLE! HELL, NO! WE WON'T GO! HELL, NO! WE WON'T GO! HELL, NO! WE WON'T GO! HELL, NO! WE WON'T GO! HELL, NO! WE WON'T GO! WHAT THE HELL'S THIS? INSPECTOR BRIMMER, COULD YOU COME IN HERE A MINUTE? WHAT'S GOING ON, CHARLIE? THE FEDS-- THEY'RE MOVING IN. OH, LORD. COME ON, GUYS, LET'S GO. HAVE A SEAT, INSPECTOR, PLEASE. GENTLEMEN, THIS IS PRUITT. HE'LL BE WORKING WITH US FROM HERE ON IN. BUT--BUT ISN'T HE... SPECIAL PEOPLE FOR SPECIAL PROBLEMS. I DIDN'T KNOW THE FBI HAD-- THERE ARE MANY THINGS YOU DON'T KNOW. SHALL WE GET TO THE POINT? THE BLACK PANTHERS HAVE UNITED WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SPONSORED BY THE COMMUNISTS TO UNDERMINE OUR EFFORTS IN VIETNAM. IN THE OPINION OF MR. HOOVER, THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY IS PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE. THEY HAVE, QUITE SIMPLY, GUARANTEED THEIR OWN EXTINCTION. JESUS. I DON'T EVEN NEED TO SAY YOUR DEPARTMENT'S HANDLING OF THE BLACK PANTHERS-- IN PARTICULAR, INSPECTOR BRIMMER'S SO-CALLED UNDERCOVER OPERATION-- HAS BEEN A COMPLETE TRAVESTY. MEMO FROM THE COMMISSIONER, ET CETERA, BACKING MR. HOOVER'S DECISION TO PLACE THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY AND THEIR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES UNDER THE FULL JURISDICTION OF THE BUREAU. MOVE IT! MOVE! MOVE! MOVE! MOVE! Kathleen Cleaver: THIS PATTERN OF HARASSMENT IS GOING ON AGAINST THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ON FRIDAY, THE WATTS OFFICE OF THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY WAS BOMBED AND DEMOLISHED. LAST WEEK, THE DES MOINES OFFICE WAS BOMBED. THIS WEEK THEY RAIDED THE SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE. THEY SHOOT US, SHOOT TEAR GAS IN OUR OFFICE, AND DRAG PEOPLE OFF TO JAIL. PHYSICALLY YOU LOOK BLACK, BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'RE FROM. YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN A SLAVE NAME AND A SLAVE MENTALITY. A SLAVE HATES HISSELF, HATES HIS SKIN. A SLAVE HATES HIS NATURAL KINKY HAIR. GIVE A GUN TO A SLAVE, HE'LL KILL HIS BROTHER. HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO CRY AND BLAME YOUR OPPRESSOR BEFORE YOU GET UP OFF YOUR KNEES AND DO IT YOUR GODDAMN SELF? KNOW THE 10 POINTS. IF YOU DON'T, YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LIVING AND DYING FOR. Fred Hampton: YOU GOT TO MAKE A DECISION, STAND UP AGAINST THE PIGS. THAT'S WHAT THE PANTHERS ARE DOING HERE, THEY CAN DO ANYTHING THEY WANT TO TO US. I AM... A REVOLUTIONARY. AFTER THAT GOOD DOCTOR IS GONE, THERE'LL NEVER BE ANOTHER BLACK MESSIAH UNLESS WE CREATE HIM. WHAT'S YOUR NAME, BOY? 5. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? WHAT'S YOUR NAME, PUNK? I SAID, 5. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? WHAT'S WITH THE NAME? I KEEP SAYING 5, LIKE THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, AND THIS COP'S GETTING PISSED. THERE AIN'T MUCH HE CAN DO TO ME SO HE GIVE ME A TICKET FOR LITTERING ON ACCOUNT OF THE PAPER HE RIPPED OUT OF MY HAND. THEY CAN'T DO TOO MUCH WITH THAT MANY EYES ON THEM. THEY AIN'T NOTHING BUT RACIST COPS. [SIREN] SHIT. WELL, WELL, WELL. IF IT ISN'T THE GREAT HUEY P. NEWTON. LICENSE AND REGISTRATION. GET OUT OF THE CAR. CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE A DRIVER TO LEAVE A VEHICLE. OUT OF THE FUCKING CAR! YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH ENGLISH, BOY? YOU, TOO. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM, OFFICER? I'M NOT RESISTING ARREST, NOR AM I ARMED. ANY USE OF FORCE ON YOUR PART IS ILLEGAL. LET'S GO FOR A WALK. AM I UNDER ARREST? AM I UNDER ARREST? AM I UNDER ARREST? [GUNSHOTS] HUEY! OH, MY GOD! SON OF A-- [MOANING] THIS DOCTOR IS ALL PREPARED FOR SURGERY. HE HAS INTERNAL BLEEDING. OK, WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE? GUNSHOTS-- MULTIPLE. GET OUT OF THE WAY! BACK OFF! THAT'S A COP KILLER. YOU KILLED A COP, BOY! [ANGRY SHOUTING] [PAINFUL SCREAMING] GET THEM OUT OF HERE! GET BACK! [CHANTING MUSLIM PRAYER] ALL RIGHT. MOVE IT NOW. COME ON. STAY STRONG, MY BROTHER. POWER TO THE PEOPLE, BOBBY. RIGHT ON, MAN. ALL RIGHT, MAN, DON'T LET THEM BREAK YOU. WHERE'S THE LAWYER? RIGHT DOWN THERE. CAN HE FREE HUEY? IF ANYBODY CAN, HE'S THE MAN. WHERE'S HE AT? IT'S GOING TO WORK. JUST MAKE SURE THE FOCUS STAYS ON FREEING HUEY. WE CAN'T MAKE ENOUGH OF THESE THINGS. WE GOT MOVIE STARS CALLING UP TO HELP. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, IT'S NATION TIME. I WISH WE DIDN'T NEED THESE BUTTONS. I WISH HUEY WAS HERE. ME, TOO. YOU SURE ABOUT THAT, MY BROTHER? LOOK AT THIS. Judge: YOU COULD JAIL A REVOLUTIONARY, BUT YOU COULDN'T JAIL THE REVOLUTION. DESPITE THE PIGS AND THE FBI, OUR POWER BASE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY CONTINUED TO GROW. EVEN MOM CAME AROUND. WELL? SERIOUS NOW. I COME OUT OF THAT WIG. ELDRIDGE, COME MEET MY MOTHER. MA, THIS IS ELDRIDGE CLEAVER. ELDRIDGE CLEAVER, THIS IS MY MOTHER. HERE'S THE GUY I TOLD YOU ABOUT. BE PROUD OF YOUR SON. SAY IT LOUD-- I'M BLACK, AND I'M PROUD. Judge: EVERYTHING IN HERE-- BUTTER, SALT, GREASE-- YOU ARE THE MALNUTRITION PANTHER, THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE. Y'ALL NEED TO BE EATING MORE. RUNNING AROUND HERE LIKE SCARECROWS. YOU DON'T EAT, YOU DON'T SLEEP. TAKE THIS HAT OFF AT THE TABLE. AIN'T NO WAY TO LIVE. IT'S GOOD TO BE SKINNY-- EASIER TO RUN FROM FAT PIGS. TV: WE BRING YOU THE FOLLOWING SPECIAL REPORT. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. WAS KILLED TONIGHT IN MEMPHIS, SHOT IN THE FACE AS HE STOOD ALONE ON THE BALCONY OF HIS HOTEL ROOM. HE DIED IN A HOSPITAL AN HOUR LATER. LAST NIGHT, HE SAID THIS... King: I JUST WANT TO DO GOD'S WILL. HE NEVER HURT NOBODY. HE HAS ALLOWED ME TO GO UP TO THE MOUNTAIN, AND I'VE LOOKED OVER AND I'VE SEEN THE PROMISED LAND. I MAY NOT GET THERE WITH YOU, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW TONIGHT THAT WE AS A PEOPLE WILL GET TO THE PROMISED LAND. [CHEERING] SO I AM HAPPY TONIGHT. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING. I'M NOT FEARING ANY MAN. MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THE GLORY OF THE COMING OF THE LORD. ? HEY, JOE ? ? A-WHERE YOU GOIN' ? ? WITH THAT GUN IN YOUR HAND? ? Judge: WHEN KING'S MESSAGE OF NONVIOLENCE ENDED IN HIS VIOLENT DEATH, FOLKS FINALLY REALIZED THAT THEY COULDN'T PRAY THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM-- JUST WHAT THE PANTHERS HAD SAID ALL ALONG. AMERICA WAS BURNING. NATIONWIDE, OUR ENROLLMENT DOUBLED IN 2 WEEKS. NO, NO. NO MORE WORDS! NO MORE WORDS. NO MORE SITTING. NO MORE PRAYING, WAITING FOR THE PIGS TO KILL US. LATER FOR LYING DOWN, WAITING TO GET SHOT LIKE DOGS. NONVIOLENCE DIED IN MEMPHIS WITH DR. KING. WE MUST RETALIATE. WE GOT THE FUCKING GUNS. IT'S TIME TO USE THEM. HOLD ON, MOTHERFUCKER! BROTHER, I HEAR YOU, BUT I DISAGREE. AND WE BOTH KNOW HUEY DISAGREES. YEAH, WE GOT GUNS, BUT THE PIG HAS GOT MORE GUNS. THE PIG HAS GOT THE NATIONAL GUARD. I AIN'T AFRAID TO FIGHT, BUT WE AIN'T STUPID EITHER. THIS HERE IS A TIME TO BE SMART. NO. LATER FOR THAT. NO, LATER FOR YOU. NOW LISTEN UP, MAN. WHAT, WE GOING TO FORGET ABOUT HUEY AND HIS TRIAL? START KILLING PIGS? START THE REVOLUTION NOW WITH ONE OF OUR LEADERS IN JAIL? YEAH. MAN, IF WE DO THAT, HUEY'S A DEAD MAN. WE'RE ALL DEAD. NO, MAN. WE STAY COOL. OH, WHAT? YOU GIVING ME ORDERS NOW? I'M JUST TELLING YOU WHAT IT IS. LATER FOR THAT. IT IS TIME TO INTENSIFY THE STRUGGLE. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. GOT TO GO. BOB-- DAMN. OH, MAN. Huey: WE MUST STAY DISCIPLINED. TO ACT WITHOUT A PLAN IS COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY. WE MUST STOP ELDRIDGE. EL RAGE IS EL RAGE. YOU KNOW HIM. HE GOT TO RECOGNIZE YOU'RE PARTY LEADER. IT AIN'T EASY RUNNING AROUND LECTURING TRYING TO RAISE BREAD TO DEFEND YOUR ASS. YOU ALWAYS COULD TALK YOUR BUTT OFF. HEY. DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOU? IT AIN'T THE SAME WITHOUT YOU, HUEY. ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE. ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE. YOU GOT TO SIT ON ELDRIDGE. HERE YOU GO. KEEP PASSING IT DOWN. HERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT. SHELLS. GIVE ME MORE SHELLS. PIGS BE HERE ANY MINUTE. WE READY FOR THEM. THIS IS FOR BROTHER MALCOLM... BROTHER MARTIN... AND BEING A MOTHERFUCKING PIG. [SIREN APPROACHING] NOW! GO! GO! GO! OUT! OUT! OUT! THERE THEY ARE! COME ON, GET UP! GET UP. COME ON! COME ON. LET'S GO! COME ON, MAN. LET'S GO! COME ON, MAN. GET INSIDE. GET INSIDE. STAY DOWN! STAY DOWN! AAH! STAY DOWN! STAY DOWN! OH, NO! STOP THEM! HELP! HELP! HELP! AH! AAH! HOLD YOUR FIRE! STAY DOWN, LITTLE BOBBY. [CRYING] GET US OUT. GO! GO! P.A.: COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP! UHH! LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT! YOU HURT? THROW DOWN YOUR WEAPONS AND COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP! I'M OK. YOU HAVE 5 SECONDS. TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF. WHAT? THE PIGS AIN'T GOING TO SHOOT YOU IF YOU'RE NAKED AND UNARMED. 3... JUST DO IT! KEEP YOUR HANDS UP. KEEP YOUR HANDS UP, BOBBY. DON'T TRY ANYTHING! I'M NOT RESISTING ARREST! I'M NOT RESISTING ARREST! PUT YOUR HANDS ON THE CAR! AAH! NO! NO! MOTHERFUCKERS! HE WAS GOING FOR THIS. AND I SAY TO THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAT I STAND HERE WITH THIS STRANGE FEELING OF JOY AND THANKSGIVING, KNOWING THAT OUR YOUNG BROTHER DID NOT DIE IN VAIN. HE DIED FOR THE PEOPLE. AND, OUT OF HIS DEATH, WE MUST GO BACK TO OUR COMMUNITY WITH THIS NEW SENSE OF LIFE FORCE FOR LIBERATION. HE SAID IT WELL, "POWER TO THE PEOPLE." HE WAS JUST A KID. BROWN POWER FOR BROWN PEOPLE, RED POWER FOR RED PEOPLE... THEY HURTING US, BABY. HUEY'S LOCKED UP. WHITE POWER FOR WHITE PEOPLE... BOBBY RUNNING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND TRYING TO HOLD THINGS TOGETHER. CY'S DEAD, AND LITTLE BOBBY. I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE HALF THE FACES AT THE MEETINGS... EXCEPT HIS. NOW, LOOK, I GOT TO GO GET ON A PLANE, GO RAISE MONEY FOR HUEY'S TRIAL. I WANT YOU ALL TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A STRONG PANTHER PRESENCE THERE. HEAR ME? YES, SIR. ALL RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT ELDRIDGE? YOU DID GET HIM OUT ON BAIL? YEAH, BUT THINGS GETTING TOO HOT. ELDRIDGE IS... IS GOING TO DISAPPEAR. THE FREE HUEY THING'S BECOME A BIT OF A RALLYING CRY FOR THE LEFT, ESPECIALLY WITH BOBBY SEALE RUNNING AROUND FANNING THE FLAMES. RALLYING CRY! THAT'S INSURRECTION! SIR, THE PANTHERS HAVE BECOME VERY RESOURCEFUL. I'M AFRAID WE'VE UNDERESTIMATED THEIR SUPPORT IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THAT'S THEIR POWER BASE. THEY SAY A BLACK PANTHER IS BORN EVERY MINUTE IN THE GHETTO. TELL HIM I WANT THAT POWER BASE NEUTRALIZED! MR. HOOVER WISHES THE ULTIMATE CONTINGENCY IMPLEMENTED. YOU MEAN... THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN! AND AGENT RODGERS, THIS CONVERSATION NEVER OCCURRED. Dorsett: RODGERS, THIS IS NO GOOD. Rodgers: CUT THE COMEDY. YOU'VE BEEN TAKING MONEY FROM THE MOB FOR YEARS. GENTLEMEN, FORGIVE ME FOR KEEPING YOU. AHH, DORSETT, NO MATTER HOW WE DENY IT, WE ALWAYS END UP ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE COIN. IT'S ALMOST FUNNY. HONESTLY, IT TURNS MY STOMACH. NEITHER YOUR STOMACH NOR YOUR OPINION MATTERS HERE, DORSETT. WHAT MATTERS IS THAT MR. TYNAN'S CLIENTS AND THE BUREAU HAVE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO OUR PANTHER PROBLEM. THE FINAL SOLUTION, YOU MIGHT SAY. OUR CLIENTS, OF COURSE, ARE VERY PLEASED MR. HOOVER DECIDED TO TAKE OUR SUGGESTION TO HEART. BY THE WAY, WHY DID HE CHANGE HIS MIND? WOMAN'S INTUITION. ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN CONTROL THE PRODUCT? CAN YOU ASSURE US THAT THIS WILL NOT GET OUT OF HAND? OF COURSE. OUR CLIENTS HAVE VAST EXPERIENCE IN THESE COMMUNITIES. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF DEGREES. YOU GIVE US FREE REIGN IN THE GHETTO, WE SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS. I'LL ASSURE YOU OF ONE THING. THE PACIFYING QUALITIES OF HEROIN ARE FORMIDABLE. A JUNKIE'S POLITICS ARE NOT LIKE YOURS AND MINE. I'LL EVEN READ THE FUTURE FOR YOU-- VERY SOON, THE JIGABOOS-- NO OFFENSE-- THE JIGABOOS WILL BE WANTING THE STUFF SO BAD-- TRYING TO GET, TO SELL-- THEY'LL BE BLOWING EACH OTHER'S BRAINS OUT. IT'S NOT A RACIAL ISSUE. IT'S A MATTER OF LAW AND ORDER. OF COURSE. AT ANY RATE, WE JUST SET THEM UP AND STEP BACK. WHEN CAN YOU GET IT OUT IN THE STREETS? AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. WE'LL MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE FROM A WAREHOUSE. DORSETT KNOWS THE LOCALE. I REITERATE. WE NEED ASSURANCES ON CONTAINMENT... THAT IT STAYS STRICTLY WITHIN THE PROBLEM AREA. I WANT YOU TO PUT SOMEBODY ON THIS. KEEP TABS ON THE NEW OPERATION. NO OFFENSE. YOU TALK AS IF THIS THING'S BEEN DECIDED. IT HAS BEEN. PIGS FIND HIM YET? NO, THEY HAVEN'T. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO WAS IN THE CAR WITH YOU. GOOD LUCK, HUEY. WHY ARE YOU HERE? FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! WHY ARE YOU HERE? FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! WHY ARE YOU HERE? FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! WHY ARE YOU HERE? FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE! POWER TO THE PEOPLE! BROTHERS AND SISTERS, STOKELY CARMICHAEL! YOU SAY THAT HUEY P. NEWTON IS A PRISONER OF WAR. NOW, MANY PEOPLE SAY THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE OR THAT THE PARTY IS EXAGGERATING. NO! BUT I THINK IT'S CLEAR-- IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR THE UNITED STATES HAS DECLARED WAR ON BLACK PEOPLE. [SHOUTING] NOW, SHE DID THAT WHEN SHE TOOK THE FIRST BLACK MAN FROM AFRICA. AH, SHE NEVER CAME OUT AND SAID THE WORDS-- "I DECLARE WAR ON BLACK PEOPLE." NO, SHE DIDN'T DO THAT. BUT LET US STUDY OUR HISTORY. TO THIS DAY, THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT DECLARED WAR ON VIETNAM, BUT THERE IS VIETNAM. AND THEY DID NOT DECLARE WAR IN NORTH KOREA, BUT THEY SURE FOUGHT IN NORTH KOREA. AND THEY DID NOT DECLARE WAR ON THE INDIANS. THEY JUST WIPED THEM OUT. RIGHT ON! RIGHT ON! THEY WIPED THEM OUT! THAT'S RIGHT! SO... WE MUST DEFINE OUR POSITION. WE ARE AT WAR. HUEY P. NEWTON, MINISTER OF DEFENSE, IS A PRISONER OF WAR. THAT'S RIGHT! WE MUST GET HIM OUT BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY! BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY! FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! SO? WE KNOW FOR SURE THERE WAS A PASSENGER. WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHO. YOU CAN'T HELP BUT ADMIRE THOSE YOUNG BROTHERS. THEY DO A LOT OF GOOD IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. YOU EVER HEARD ABOUT THE COMMON GOOD? THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS MORE THAN A SIMPLE COLLECTION OF GHETTOS. THIS COUNTRY WAS BUILT ON CAPITALISM AND DEMOCRACY. IN A DEMOCRACY, THE MAJORITY RULES. WE ARE A MINORITY UNLESS WE INTEGRATE FULLY. WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON, BROTHER? NO. WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON, OFFICER? NOW, YOU SAY THAT HUEY NEWTON OPENED FIRE THAT NIGHT WITHOUT ANY PROVOCATION. WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE? IT WAS A DARK NIGHT. THERE WAS LOTS OF CONFUSION. WELL, SIR, I WAS THERE. THAT'S RIGHT, YOU WERE. HE WAS THERE. HE SAW EVERYTHING. AND HE IS NOT ON TRIAL. HE DOES NOT NEED TO LIE TO SAVE HIS OWN LIFE. YOUR WITNESS. THANK YOU. NO QUESTIONS, YOUR HONOR. WELL, YOU MAY STEP DOWN. BUT IF IT PLEASE THE COURT, I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE TESTIMONY AT THIS TIME FROM A NEW WITNESS, ONE WHO, UH, IS NOT ON TRIAL FOR HIS LIFE, BUT ONE WHO WAS ALSO THERE. I CALL... GENE McKINNEY TO THE STAND. I OBJECT, YOUR HONOR! WHO IS THIS MAN? THIS IS AN EYEWITNESS, YOUR HONOR-- THE PASSENGER IN HUEY NEWTON'S CAR. Judge: OVERRULED. MR. GARRY, YOU MAY EXAMINE YOUR WITNESS. Bailiff: DO YOU SWEAR TO TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH, NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH SO HELP YOU GOD? I DO. MR. McKINNEY, WERE YOU A PASSENGER IN THE CAR THAT NIGHT, OCTOBER 28, 1967? I KEEP SAYING 5, LIKE THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. YES. YES, SIR, I WAS. AND DID YOU WITNESS THE SHOOTOUT? [GUNSHOTS] YES, SIR, I DID. [CROWD TALKING] ORDER. ORDER. FROM WHAT YOU SAW... DID HUEY NEWTON START THE SHOOTING? LOOK, AM I UNDER ARREST? 'CAUSE ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA-- TAKE THAT LAW BOOK AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS, NIGGER! NO! HUEY! HUEY! HUEY! NO, SIR, HE DID NOT. ORDER! FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! Judge: ORDER! ORDER! WELL, THEN... DID SOMEONE ELSE START THE SHOOTING? I REFUSE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT MIGHT INCRIMINATE ME. [CROWD TALKING] Judge: ORDER! ORDER! DID YOU SHOOT THE OFFICERS IN QUESTION? AGAIN I WILL TAKE THE FIFTH AMENDMENT ON THAT QUESTION ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT MIGHT INCRIMINATE ME. Judge: ORDER! ORDER! FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! Reporter: THIS JUST IN. GENE McKINNEY PLEADED THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, AND IN DOING SO, DREW SUSPICION FROM HUEY P. NEWTON TO HIMSELF. IF NEWTON DID NOT INITIATE THE SHOOTING, CHARGES AGAINST HIM COULD BE GREATLY REDUCED. HOWEVER, HAVING BEEN GRANTED IMMUNITY IN EXCHANGE FOR TESTIFYING, McKINNEY HIMSELF CANNOT BE PROSECUTED. FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! ? REVOLUTION HAS COME ? FREE HUEY! FREE HUEY! ? REVOLUTION HAS COME ? Huey: YOU FIT THE PROFILE, BROTHER. YOU EXACTLY THE TYPE OF NIGGER THEY THINK THEY CAN TRUST. NO! Eldridge: NOW WE MUST RETALIATE. WE GOT THE FUCKING GUNS. IT IS TIME TO USE THEM! YOU DON'T LIKE TO SEE A TRAITOR GET HURT? ANYTHING HAPPEN TO HUEY, I'M GOING TO FUCK YOU UP.

THEY PUMPED IN THE DOPE TO NEUTRALIZE THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND DESTROY THE PANTHER POWER BASE, BUT DRUGS OVERFLOWED THE BORDERS OF THE GHETTO AND ENDED UP ON ALL AMERICA'S DOORSTEP. LOOK AT THAT! DESPITE ONGOING PERSECUTION BY THE AUTHORITIES, THE PANTHERS CONTINUED TO PROVIDE BREAKFAST PROGRAMS, SICKLE CELL ANEMIA TESTING, EVEN SCHOOLS FOR THE COMMUNITY. BEFORE THEY WERE EVENTUALLY CRUSHED, THE PANTHERS HAD CHAPTERS IN ALMOST EVERY STATE OF THE UNION AND SEVERAL FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IT CAME OUT LATER THAT HOOVER AND THE FBI USED ILLEGAL TACTICS TO DESTROY THE PANTHERS. SEVERAL PANTHERS ARE STILL BEING HELD IN PRISON ON TRUMPED-UP CHARGES. HUEY WAS KILLED IN 1989 IN A DRUG DEAL. BOBBY LIVES IN PENNSYLVANIA. HE TEACHES AND LECTURES. THE WAY I SEE IT, THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES. ? NOW IS THE TIME TO FREE YOUR MIND AND YOUR SOUL ? ? Y'ALL ? ? OFF THE STORY I'VE NEVER BEEN TOLD ? ?
