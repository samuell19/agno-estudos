MAN: Should've just gone along, Wood, kept your mouth shut! WOOD: (GRUNTS) You son of a bitch! Who are you? Take off that mask! MAN: I'm somebody who's been sent here to deal with you big time, motherfucker! (PANTING) (GRUNTS) (GROANING) (GASPING) (LAUGHS) Why are you doing this? Who are you? The name's Brick Bardo, my friend. Don't you recognize this face? (GROANS) Don't you recognize my voice? Should I? It'd be nice. But it just goes to show people just don't remember. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know you, I ain't done nothing to you. Not me, my brother. But that's another story, isn't it, Davey? You know me? (CHUCKLES) Come on, you think I'd do this to somebody I didn't know? Besides, it's rude to destroy a man's life and then not remember. I don't know what you're talking about. (SIGHS) Well, I'm here to help your memory. In a moment, you're gonna be begging your brain to remember. Fuck you! No, fuck you. (SCREAMING) (GROANING) (GASPING) They're all learning like you're learning now. It's here, Davey. Judgment Day, Atonement, the Apocalypse, call it whatever you want, but it's here, and accounts are past due. (GASPING) Help me remember. Help me remember. Five years ago, you received evidence that my brother was involved in fight-fixing. But since that's all he knew, it destroyed him after they kicked him out. Now, give me the name of the four who gave the evidence. The four who traded lives to save their own asses. I'm not sure. Get sure, Davey, get real, real sure. (GRUNTING) Okay, okay. (SCREAMING) Okay, okay. Fuck! Brent Caldwell, Mike Johnson. (GASPING) Billy Munoz, and the girl, the girl... Connie, Connie something, I can't remember. I can't remember. Pretty good for a dead man. We weren't trying to hurt your brother. It was just part of cleaning up the sport. I know, I know, I know, I know. He just got caught in the sweep. It wasn't personal. It never is. He was innocent, you know, and that's just cause. But that's between me and the devil now. (GRUNTING) They destroyed him and that needs justice. I'll turn life into a nightmare, mister. (GASPING) Nightmares, they're fuckin' scary to everyone, aren't they? They'll be comin' here to see me in Vegas, 'cause I'm sending them personal invitations, and I'll be waiting, mister. Waiting to take all their lost god fucking souls. (GROANING) BRICK: Those are the guilty ones, Max. Let's bring them to trial. MAX: I'll start with Brent Caldwell and bring him to you. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Oh, man, am I fucked up! (GIGGLING) Oh, royally. (EXHALES) Nothing's gonna take away this pain. No liquor, drugs, nothing! BRENT: Hey, you! How about some comfort? Comfort? What the fuck do I know about comfort? (SNIFFING) I wouldn't know it if it bit my ass. What is comfort anyways? ♪ She's looking better than the dirty city ♪ She's looking at everybody in the eye ♪ (SIGHS) How the fuck would I get those things, huh? I mean, really, look at me. (SNIFFS) What would comfort want with me? I'd settle for some blow, though, that would be nice and fine. I could show you some comfort. Really. I'll take away that pain for a little while. Would you like that? You can do that, huh? Come on, I got some blow. It'll make you forget. Let's go. To your room? Of course. I got some time before I have to go to the arena. I'm fighting here tomorrow night. See, I'm the main event. Ah, you said you were champion kickboxer, right? That's right. Heavyweight champ. Why me, champ? There's something about you. (CHUCKLES) Like being the only girl in the bar at closing. Come on, we'll make each other feel real good. Make the pain go away, huh? Hey, I can try. You must be some kind of god, honey. I got some blow, come on. I don't have all fuckin' night, so take your drink, and let's go to my room. Now. Okay, all right. Let's just go make it feel all better. (MOANING) I'm done! (PANTING) What the fuck you mean, you're done? Hey! What the fuck? I'm not through! Yes, you are, Brent Caldwell, heavyweight champ. (CHOKING) Breathe deep or suck a bullet. Good night, sweet darling. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? BRICK: Hello, Billy, my name is Brick Bardo. So glad to catch you in. How'd you know it was me? Who else could it be? What do you want? Not what, who. (CHUCKLES) I want you, Billy. I want you to come and visit me for a few days, see if I can change your perspective on life. Who is this? Someone who wants to see you very, very bad. Come out and see me, Billy. I left directions in your car downstairs. You're crazy. Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLING) Crazy enough to kill your daughter if you don't come and see me tonight, Billy. My daughter? Yes. Dear, sweet Alice. (LAUGHING) I got her right here. You wanna talk to her? Yes. All right. Here, speak to your father, Alice. ALICE ON PHONE: Daddy? This man says you're comin' to get me. Hurry, Daddy. He's... He's bad to me. BRICK: That's enough for now, Alice. Billy, are you still there? Don't hurt my daughter, please. Then, I'll see you tonight. Yes. Okay, no funny business, or you're likely to find your daughter's body parts hanging from hooks. Do we understand each other? Yes. Good. (DIAL TONE DRONING) (GRUNTING) (YELLING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANING) (GRUNTING) Motherfucker! Please, man, don't shoot. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. Bullshit. You tell me where Damon went with our goddamn stash, or I'll make you wish we blew your fuckin' head off. Right, quick, speak up, man. I don't know Damon, man, I just know him from the neighborhood. I don't hang out with him, man. Don't fuck with me, cocksucker! (GRUNTING) Don't wanna be doing that at all. I didn't do it, man. I don't know shit. Yeah, you don't know shit, that's why you ran when you saw us. I ran 'cause I thought it was my colors, man. Colors! We're businessmen, asshole. We give a fuck about your goddamn shirt color. (COUGHS) Now, last time, where's Damon and our stash? I don't know, man. Really, I don't know. (YELLING) (GROANS) (GRUNTING) MAN: Damn bitch! (GROANING) (COUGHING) Thanks a lot. Don't thank me, Mike. You know me? All about you. What the hell's going on here? When's the last time you were in Vegas? I'll meet you at my place then? I told Bob I had another business dinner again. Is that chump ever gonna wise up? He's 55 and desperate. Even if he knew, he wouldn't care. He's just afraid I'm not gonna come home. The day that happens, I'll make sure I have half his fortune in my pocket. And I'll check out of this rat race. I've had it with everything, to tell you the truth. I can't sleep, I've got bad nightmares. I get these fuckin' headaches. God, I just feel like some kind of whore. You got the son of a bitch to invest in this corporation, and now the World Martial Arts Association is the biggest thing in full-contact promotions. What more could you want? More than this. Years ago, this was my dream. But no more, Steve. I'm burned out on martial arts. Besides, there's not enough money in it. I just want my divorce settlement from the wrinkled creep I married and move on to another life. But you paid in blood to build the association. Can you really just walk away from it, Connie? I have to. Besides, I married a rich man and in six months I'm free and the nightmares will stop. Speaking of nightmares, Connie, how can you stand to make love with him, the old ugly bastard? I think of his money, I kiss his money, I sleep with his money. And then I have you. I make love with you and I feel like I'm in the real world again. God, I've made so many mistakes. I've hurt so many people. Don't think about it. Make me forget, Steve, make me forget. (GRUNTS) (SCREAMS) Hello, Connie. I've been waiting to see you for a very long time. Sorry to interrupt you. I forgot what a cheap slut you are. I should've known you'd be trying to get laid. Things haven't changed much from Huntington Beach, have they? Do I know you from Huntington Beach? (LAUGHING) Connie. I just beat your boyfriend to death and you don't even bat an eyelash. God fucking damn, are you one cold bitch. Yeah, one heartless, cold bitch. You've seen more than a few people die in your life. Who are you, goddamn it? Your conscience. What do you want, money? (CHUCKLES) I'm not like you. What do you want then, rape? I'm not like you. What do you fucking want? I want you to come to a party I'm giving. (LAUGHING) Yeah, just a small, informal affair with some old friends. I promise you good food and sparkling conversation. Sure, I'll come. You seem like an intriguing man, sounds like an interesting party. Oh, it'll be more than interesting. It'll be illuminating. Look, I know what you want. Do you? Let's just cut the chase and get right down to it, huh? Down to what? You want me, right? I'm here, aren't I? Yes, just don't hurt me, and I'll go along with whatever you want. Is that right? Just stay cool. I'm not getting hot, are you? You know what I mean. Just relax. Don't do something stupid, Connie. You wouldn't wanna do that. Just relax. (GRUNTING) You were supposed to be the best. The great Connie Angel. The first female martial artist ever to beat a professional male in full contact. And gorgeous to boot, lightning in a bottle. Yeah, I've heard a lot about you. You seem to have lost something, a little speed, a little technique. You're getting rusty sitting behind your big, fat desk. Just give me a minute and I'll shake off the rust, you son of a bitch. (SCREAMS) (GROANING) I want you to remember everything and you will. I'd kill you now, except I have to find out who was responsible, really responsible. I have to learn the truth. And I think you'll learn something, too. And then you'll die. (SLOW MUSIC PLAYING) Alice! Alice! BRICK: Good night, Billy. See you in a little while. They're all set. No after-effects. Give our guests a half an hour to recover. Then I'll give them a taste of what's to come. The guilty should rise to the surface, I suspect. Be careful, Brick. I mean, they're all capable. I'm always careful, Max, you know that. (SIGHS) We won't have surprise next time. I'm not my brother. When this is over, then you'll let it go for good? After tonight, I'll forget everything. You promise? After five years, I'll finally let it go. And we can go on, where we left off five years ago? (SIGHS) Such as it is, yes. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (GROANS) (GROANS) (COUGHS) Just relax. Brick will be here shortly to start the matches. What matches? Pardon me. Connie, I can't hear you. You gotta speak up. I said, what matches? Matches of guilt and innocence, Connie. You're all martial artists who fought professionally at one time or another. You're all current or former world champions. Hey, Connie, you're each gonna get in that ring behind me and fight one last match. The match of your life. 'Cause after that, you won't fight again. You'll be dead. Who are you? I'm Max, Brent. I told you back in the hotel room before we fucked. Just hold your questions. Brick will be here shortly. He'll explain everything. Brent. What the fuck's going on here? I don't have a goddamn clue. I picked that bitch up in a bar and in the middle of it, she pulled out a pistol and stuck this shit over my face... Brent Caldwell, WCK champ. Yeah, that's right. Who the fuck are you? Hey, I'm Mike Johnson, man. Hell, I held the light heavyweight title three years ago. (SCOFFS) Yeah, right. PK double A, till they went out of business. I put 'em out of business. Yeah, I know you, too. Connie Angel. Miss Big Time Fight Promoter. They got my daughter. Who the fuck are you? Hey, chump. I'm talking to you, hey! Huh? What's your name? Billy. Billy Munoz. Billy Munoz? You don't look like Billy Munoz to me, chump. Yeah, it's him. That's Billy, all right. I recognize him now. I always wondered what happened to you, Billy. Ah, come on! Fuck the reunion. Let's just worry about getting me out of here, all right? They got my daughter. I need help. She's all I got. Give me a break. I need help. It's okay, Billy, we all need help. Can anyone get loose? Sure. But I've decided to sit here. Shut up, Brent. Seems like you two know each other pretty well, huh? Yeah, we messed the sheets up a couple of times. Huh, Connie? Fuck you, Brent. You have. See, but you won't screw me again. Not like the last time. You ripped me off for 25 Gs! CONNIE: Who is this Brick, anyway? MIKE: Shit, I don't know. Why are they doing this to us? All I remember is my fight against Wood Wilson. Wood Wilson. The lightweight champ? Yeah, he was the first man I ever beat. Knockout on the first. That was really something back then. Well, you know what, Connie, you're still really something, even now. Better start taking this seriously, asshole. You know, I remember an inquiry about your fight, Connie. I got called from the Sports Commission to tell them about Wood fixing fights. That fight, I never made it to testify. They cancelled out on me. I had a call, too. I had a fight comin' up, but they wouldn't give me my license unless I testified against Wood. What about you, Brent? Do you know anything about Wood Wilson? No! I was nowhere near Vegas then. Nowhere close. Are you sure, Brent? I seem to remember you were here for some promotion. Well, your fuckin' memory sucks, Connie. I wasn't anywhere near Vegas around that time, all right? They're after more than just killing us. One of us has information that they want. About what? I don't know. But whatever happens here, we gotta stick together. Can you help me find my daughter? Yes, Billy. We get out together. All of us. All of us, okay? Jesus! I think I can get my hand loose. (BILLY GRUNTING) That's one hell of a trick, Billy boy. Hey, I don't know about the others, but it sure entertained the shit out of me. What're you gonna do next? Pluck out an eye? Billy, watch out! Christ, Billy, look what you've done to your arm. (GRUNTING) BRICK: Terrible, Billy. What a thing to do to your own arm. I don't know what's to be done now. I'll just have to deal with damaged goods. (GROANS) That's life, isn't it, Billy? Damaged goods, that's you! I want to see my daughter. Shut up, Billy. You're not in a position to demand jack shit. Look, you just behave yourself and stop creating all these problems for yourself. Why are you doing this? (LAUGHS) Shut the fuck up! We'll deal with you in good time. We'll deal with it all in good time! Now fucking what? CONNIE: It's starting. That's what I liked about you, Connie. You're so fuckin' smart. (CLICKS) JACK: Please don't hurt me. Please! BRICK: Then tell me what I want to know, Jack. JACK: Look, Sam was the one who dealt with whoever was in charge of the fight-fixing. It was Sam's friend and I got my instructions from Sam. BRICK: But Sam's dead, Jack. Died in a car wreck three years ago. Got himself decapitated before I could get to him. So that leaves you, Jack. You were the State Sports Commissioner. JACK: I don't know who was running the scam. It was Sam's friend, not mine. I just got my kickback and went along. Please, I... I'm telling you the truth. It was Sam's friend who was in charge of everything. Okay, Jack, okay. See, that wasn't so bad, was it? No! And dying won't be so bad, either. No! (GUN FIRING) (JACK GROANING) (GLASS SHATTERING) (JACK GASPING) All right, what we're gonna try and do is establish some communication. Now, Jack's comments about Sam's friend were pretty interesting. Wouldn't you say, Brent? Hey, I could give a fuck, asshole. Oh, you'll give a mighty fuck, Brent. 'Cause one of you four is Sam's friend. One of you four set my brother up. That's bullshit. Oh, yes, it's true. One of you set up the whole stinking mess. Look, you got it all wrong. I never testified. I never been before a commission and I don't know jack shit about Wood Wilson. Oh, but haven't you ever passed on a little inside information, Mike? Didn't you know about some fixing and tried to get yourself in on it? So fuckin' what? I tried to skim a little on the side with some dark bets, who the fuck wasn't? My brother wasn't. That's what got him destroyed. First his credibility, then his livelihood and finally his life. One of you four was involved in fight-fixing big time. My brother found out about it. One of you went to him and gave him an offer that he had to take, or else. He told you to go fuck yourselves and leave him alone or he'd report your ass to the Commission. One of you beat him to it and fucked him royally. Now which one of you was it? Come on, you can save your associates a lot of pain by coming forward. One of you motherfuckers got me into this. You're all guilty, Brent, but one of you is guiltier than the rest. (SCOFFS) That's bullshit. Who knows? One of you might even be a murderer, Brent. How do you figure that? Easy. I'll explain. One by one. Let's start with Mike. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) MAX: Move funny and my pistol might crack a laugh. Come on, Mike, get up. Come on, get up. We don't have all day. We have a dog show comin' here tomorrow, hurry up. Hey, Mike, kick his ass. We'll all go have a beer. You got it, champ. Come on. BRICK: Okay, Mike, here's the deal. It's simple. You and I fight till one of us is dead. You win, you and the others go free. I win, you die and the others won't concern you anymore. Any questions? Well, what about her? Does she go along with it after I kick your ass? (LAUGHING) After? Jesus Christ, aren't we confident! Look here, don't worry. You kill me and she won't mess with you anymore. This is my deal. She's just along for the ride. Let's get it on, asshole. Five years ago, you tried to cut yourself in on a fix. My brother refused to go along. And they sent you there to talk to him, to convince him. Look, man, I didn't hurt him. I told him if he didn't go along with the plan, there'd be people out there that would hurt him. That's all I did. Oh, really? That's all? But didn't you tell your friends that Wood Wilson was going to be trouble? That if they cut you in, you would take care of Wood? I didn't do shit. I was young. It was all talk. There was all that money. Yeah, I bet it was. I bet it was. But you told your friends that Wood was going to be trouble. So they went to see the one who eventually took care of Wood. Look, man, it wasn't me. Well, that's what we're about to find out, Mike. (MIKE GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GRUNTING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANING) (GRUNTING) Watch me give it to him. How do you like it? (CHOKING) BRICK: Big man, huh? (BREATHING HEAVILY) (CHUCKLING) (GRUNTING) (GASPING) (MIKE COUGHING) (WHEEZING) (BOTH GRUNTING) You're a dead man, Mike. Tell me what you know and go in peace. Fuck you! (COUGHING) Look, cut this shit, Mike. Look, tell me what you know. Well, don't try to protect any of them, they wouldn't do the same for you. I know you told Wood to lay down against Connie or else... Go to hell, you son of a bitch. I never said that. All right, Mike, have it your way. Have it all, motherfucker. BILLY: I'll talk to you. You'll talk, Billy? (MIKE GASPING) Well, then come on down. Good luck, Billy. BRENT: He's going to need it. Kick his ass. Come on, dumb shit, let's go. (MIKE GRUNTING) You're some guy, Billy, comin' to Mike's rescue. I wanna see my daughter. Well, talk to me first. No deal. You wanna see her skinned and hanging from hooks in bite-sized pieces? Let me see her and we'll talk. Come on, Billy, give us a little taste. Let me judge the quality of what you have to say. No deal. Let me see her. But she's already dead, Billy. (LAUGHING) She's already dead. Oh, God! No! (LAUGHING CONTINUES) (EXCLAIMING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (WHIMPERING) (BILLY COUGHING) Five years ago you sold out, Billy. You threw... You threw a fight against my brother, then you testified that he was in on it. Look, I know how it was for you. Your career was almost over, your wife left you and you had two kids to raise and support. You needed the money and it was a bigger payday than you'd ever get in the ring. I understand all that. I don't fault why you did it. God knows, I'd kill to feed my kids if I had any. You killed my brother, I killed your daughter. Fair is fair. Now listen to me, Billy. Listen very carefully. I know you're hurt. (BILLY COUGHING) You'll probably die, but you have to listen and think. You have one more child left, a six-year-old boy. Now, nothing is going to happen to him. Nothing will happen to him if you can tell me who set up my brother. Who came to you? Was it Connie or Brent? (WHISPERS) Brent. BILLY: I never met 'em. (BRENT GRUNTING) Just a letter, I swear. My son, please... You can't tell me who it was even though your son's life's at stake? I swear, nothing. All right, Billy, have it your own way. Consider your son a dead boy. (SHOUTING) No! (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) Looks like we only have two left. Come on down here, Brent. You got a big mouth, let's see you do some talking with it. I'd be glad to come up there and beat the shit out of your head! Well, you can come on up and try. Go ahead, Max. (SIGHING) Don't fuck with me, bitch. (BRENT EXCLAIMING) Don't fuck with me, asshole. It's not a good idea. Now get up and go see Brick. The World Champion. I'm honored, Brent. Mr. Fight-Fixing himself. It's not every day an amateur like me gets to go a few rounds with the champ. (LAUGHING) It sort of makes me a Rocky, don't it? Fuck you, asshole. I don't know shit about you and I don't know your brother and I didn't testify about him and I didn't bring him no fuckin' messages, so why don't you do us both a favor and let me go, and I won't say shit about this, to no one. So you think I made a mistake by bringing you here? No shit, Sherlock. Why should I trust you? You're not exactly known for it. I got a career I don't wanna fuck with. Do you think I'm gonna risk it over those chumps? People have died here, Brent. You don't see me cryin'. (SCOFFS) Jesus. You're one cold bastard. No. I'm a smart bastard. That's right. You've always been smart, haven't you? Always lookin' out for number one. You'll do anything to make sure nobody fucks with your career. That's right. But you were the one that came up with the idea, weren't you? That's bullshit. The money was getting real good back then. All those easy fixed fights. Huh? It's a great scam for you and the others. And you were guaranteed the world championship. Life was good. Only you heard that someone was going to put a stop to it, huh? Someone was going to put a hurt on your lifestyle. That's bullshit. But that's what it was to you, Brent. And that really pissed you off! Sure the others said that they would take care of it, that they would deal with Wood. But that wasn't good enough for you, was it? No, you figured those fools may be able to trust their future on some half-assed setup, but you weren't. No. Taking away Wood's license, his credibility, his freedom. That wasn't really dealing with him in your mind, was it? No. No, where you come from, dealing with the punk meant really dealing with him, didn't it? What is he saying, Brent? You killed Wilson? That's right, Connie, that's exactly what he did. He dealt with Wood Wilson big time. (GRUNTING) You killed my brother, motherfucker. (BOTH GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) (SHOUTING) (SHOUTING) You're being dealt with, aren't you, Brent? (COUGHING) Please, it'll work out, please. My brother didn't beg you. How could you know? (GRUNTING) Because I was there, motherfucker. I was just fuckin' there. (CHOKING) And I didn't beg you. (PANTING) (GROANING) Connie, Connie. CONNIE: Mike. Brick, just one more. Just one more and it's over. (SIGHS) Do you want to rest? You have time. No. Let's finish it. You saved me, Max. It's my job, I was a nurse. I was lucky to get you. You took me out of my life, you showed me possibilities. I could be cleaning bedpans back at Desert Valley Hospital. Instead I'm here, watching some pretty damn exciting kickboxing matches. (GRUNTS) Come on. MAX: You knew this would be hard, Brick. You'll be healed if you put this behind you. (CRYING NERVOUSLY) Come on. Just one more, Brick. Connie Angel is the final one. Come on. (STRAINING) Put the bitch in her goddamn grave, so we can get on with our lives. Bring her to me, Max. (GRUNTING) (CONNIE GASPING) (CONNIE GRUNTING) Not very nice, Connie. But then again, that's the way you are. Cold and casual. (GRUNTING) (CRYING) Poor Max. She really loved me. She really cared for me. (SIGHING) God, I promised her so much. Now she ends up like this. Ain't that a bitch? Ain't life one son of a goddamn whore? (BREATHING HEAVILY) Oh, well, so it goes. Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well. (LAUGHING) (SIGHING) I loved you, Connie. But to do what you've done was just too fuckin' much, girl. (CRYING) It was just too fuckin' much. I couldn't take it. What are you saying? Oh, God. I'm Wood Wilson. I mean, I was Wood Wilson. (STUTTERING) I mean, I don't know. You're tryin' to tell me you're Wood Wilson? (SCOFFS) You expect me to believe that? I knew Wood Wilson. I lived with him, made love to him. I knew Wood and you're not him. (STUTTERING) Look, I know I don't look like Wood anymore. Brent fixed my face really good. Used a lead pipe on it. Turned me into a bloody mess. The little prick didn't stop until his hands were too tired. He didn't leave me for dead, he figured I had to be dead. (WHIMPERING) Modern medicine's a miracle, don't you think, Connie? I was found and they saved my life. They rebuilt me almost totally. I've got so many plates and pins and metal rods in me, I can't even go through airport security. The sons of bitches rebuilt my broken body and useless face and gave me new ones. Not better, but different. But that was okay with me because I wasn't Wood Wilson anymore. He seemed like a long lost brother that I... I once knew, but could barely remember. (SIGHING) Sounds like you had a lot of brain damage, Brick. I guess they couldn't fix that, huh? Oh, I'm fixed all right. Now I'm fixed just right. You're not Wood Wilson! The man I knew would never do what you're doing. He was the sweetest, kindest person. You're nothing but a child-killing bastard. But if Wood were alive, I'd tell him how much I love him, and miss him and how empty my life's been without him. I'd beg for his forgiveness. I'd tell him that I did it to save his life. I figured, if Wood got kicked out of the sport, then they'd leave him alone. You were really into it, weren't you, Connie? I never knew. (LAUGHING) I guess it's like they say, "Love is blind." I was more than deep into it. I helped set up the whole deal. Everything. I was the boss. (LAUGHS) Back then, I thought I'd make enough money, and then I'd get out and Wood and I could just live forever. I thought that was the right thing to do. I didn't want Wood to end up a broken, busted-up boxer, with nothing to show for all those years of fighting. I did it for us. (SIGHS) But Wood was such a straight, honorable guy, he'd never go along, he'd probably hate me for it. So, when the money started to flow, that's when things got out of control. I couldn't protect Wood anymore. I thought it was worth it. I thought it was worth it, Wood! I love you, Connie. I always have, I always will. I love you, Wood. (SIGHS) Just how did it come to this? It was my fault. Me and my stupid ambition. I'm so sorry. I know. So, what do we do now? How do we make it right? That's what I'm trying to do. I'm tryin' to make it right, Connie. It's over, Wood. It's not quite over yet. It's over! I'm going to the police. By the time they get here, Billy's daughter will be dead. (SIGHING) If I fight you, then you let the girl go. Yes. Here's the key to where she's locked up. Okay. I guess you were right, Brick. It really does have to be this way. I've been waiting for this moment for a long time, Connie. And I know in my heart, you have, too. (SHOUTING) (BOTH GRUNTING) You won't take me down like you did my brother. No lucky punch. No first-round knockout. There wasn't anything lucky about it, Brick. I was just better. Like hell. (BOTH GRUNTING) (PANTING) BRICK: You used my brother, Connie. Then you killed him when you were through. (GROANING) (CONNIE GASPING) (EXCLAIMING) You can't love someone the way my brother loved you. He'd rather die than see you hurt. (BREATHING HEAVILY) But I'm not him. I'll show you how it should go. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (EXCLAIMING) (CONNIE GASPING) Connie, stop. I remember. I finally remember. Remember this, asshole. (BOTH GRUNTING) (CRYING) I thought you were Wood Wilson, but I was wrong. You're Brick Bardo. 'Cause Wood Wilson died five years ago. (LAUGHS) (PHONE RINGING) WOMAN ON PHONE: Alice and Billy Munoz are here to see you, Ms. Angel. Thank you, Linda. I'll be there in just a moment. Don't worry, Billy. I'm going to take good care of your children. The nightmares are all over.
