It's not what do we need, it's not what do we want... Dinner's ready, honey. ...it's who. Never again will you need to mourn the loss of a loved one. Never again will you need to go to bed lonely. Never again will you need to walk this life alone. Fuck me now. Nothing in life is free, but if you're willing to pay, well, then I promise you, it'll be the best money you've ever spent. True love. It isn't found. It is ordered. Call Wifelike now. Update your wife, upgrade your life. Marion Venter. Agent. I didn't realize you actually came to this facility. And miss the chance to thank the agent that leads this region in recoveries? Your work, Agent, has made a lot of husbands very happy. I thank you, sir. And while we're on the subject, I wish to thank you for Meredith. She means everything to me. You've been through a lot, William. Lost your wife, suffered. It hurts. It's why I do what I do, why you do what you do. And all your hard work should be rewarded. And what better reward than a loving wife? Happy wife, happy life. Keep fighting the good fight, Agent. Until next time. Until next time, s-- And he's gone. And I'm talking to an empty room. I'm still doing it. Your wife is ready to go home. Her vitals, brain activity and battery have all been charged and are ready for Companionship. We've uploaded all of her information and reviewed all her settings. She's perfect. Hi. Hi! Can I have a minute of your time? Literally, a minute that will change the world. We don't change the world. It changes us. I beg to differ. Would you sign our petition? We believe that love is real, it's not artificial, and we need to end Wifelike now. What's your name? Meredith. "Meredith." Thank you. Open your eyes. Welcome home. "Home." Breathe. It'll seem strange at first, but you'll get used to it. You can walk. You just have to remember how. Trust me. That's it. The first couple of minutes are always the hardest. Your information is still being processed. Just let it sink in. It'll all feel completely natural soon. William. Yes. I'm your husband. And you are my wife, Meredith. What is it? Your heart. It's beating quite fast. It always does when you're near me. How do you feel? "Feel." This feels... familiar. This house. You. It should feel familiar. Everything you see here is yours. Meredith must have loved her life. You are Meredith. And, yes, Meredith loved her life. The more you learn about her, the faster yours and Meredith's minds will merge. Soon you and her will be as one. Welcome home, Meredith. Would you like Meredith to touch you now? Yes. Please activate intimacy settings. All you need to do is make direct eye contact with your Companion to get started. Now, identify yourself, choose a command and authorize activation. William Bradwell. Initiate voice command. Activate intimacy mode. William Bradwell-- Open settings. Set level. Languages. English. Please save. Saved. Owner identification: verified. Voice of William Bradwell. Recognized and saved.

And please note that any damage done to your Companion will result in its immediate return to our facility, where you will be liable for all repairs. Your Companion is now fully sexually active. Enjoy your evening, Mr. Bradwell. Hey. You may initiate physical contact at any time. I'm nervous. Meredith will go slow. Were you satisfied with Meredith's performance? Yes. Very. Will you sleep here with me tonight? In order to be active tomorrow, Meredith's battery needs to fully recharge overnight. Good night, William. Begin charging. They're people too! They're becoming more and more aware. They need rights! No more sex slaves! No more sweatshops! Join us! Get out here, and together, we can make a difference. Join the SCAIR! Join the SCAIR! Join the SCAIR! The world's going mad. How could a world go mad? It's just an expression. It means things are really messed up. Makes my job more difficult. Meredith's data indicates that you're an agent for the Companion Recovery Unit. Mm-hmm. But what does your job entail? I protect people like you. Does Meredith have a job? Would Meredith like a job? Breaking news just in. Two more Companions are reported missing. Police suspect abductions. This brings this week's total to 15 reported. Fuck. Why would someone steal a Companion? It's not a someone. It's an organization. They call themselves the SCAIR-- Sentient Citizens for AI Rights. We call 'em terrorists. We're trying to catch their leader, the Ring Master. We can't find him anywhere. It's like chasing a goddamn ghost. What do these terrorists do with them? They use them as weapons. They reprogram Companions to walk into a crowded space with explosives strapped to their chests. Some they sell on the black market. Like I said, the world's going mad. Thank you. Screen off. What's the yellow stuff? And did it eat the bacon? It's polenta. And article 51 in the rules and regulations packet you received yesterday states that a Companion is unable to cause direct harm to their owner. Adding bacon greatly increases the risk of developing heart disease. You gotta be fucking shitting me. Meredith is not fucking shitting you. Meredith wasn't a vegan. I like bacon. I want you to cook bacon. You can override this rule, but you must first sign a waiver acknowledging you are fully aware of the potential risks. Would you like one emailed to you? Yes, I would. This, is it any good? Meredith cannot decide that for you. Yeah, it's good. I still want my bacon though. Have I told you how beautiful you are today? Only once. Forgive me. I gotta go. Have a great day at work, husband. Mm-hmm. It's William. Thank you. Open makeup tutorial. As you all know, another abduction took place this morning. We got two missing Companions. Get out there and find them. The SCAIR has already taken responsibility. Their numbers are growing. As for our recoveries, Agent Bradwell is well ahead of you all for the week, recovering ten Companions, four just yesterday. So let's all give him a hand. Just curious. Who's in second place, Sarge? You, Jack. But no one remembers who comes in second. You just did. Hey, Jack. Coming second just means you were the first to lose. Hey, Sarge? Any leads on the investigation into the Ring Master? Interrogations are under way, but as of right now, we ain't got shit on him. Let's change that. Be careful out there. Their movement is growing. We have visual. Got it. Backup is on their way. Stand by and await further instructions. I see her. I'm going in. I gave you an order. What's your name? Wendy. Are you operational? No. All my services have been disconnected. How many more are inside? There's two more Companions inside. His name is Jason Wilkes. He's right-handed. He weighs 170 pounds. He stands at 6'2" and he has high blood pressure. There was another man inside, but I couldn't get a clear vision of him. Stay safe. He went in without me, didn't he? If you try and stop me, I will blow her fuckin' head off. There's no scenario where you walk outta here free. Lower your gun, or you won't walk outta here at all. Fuck you. Girl, get up. You're coming with me. She's not going anywhere. Neither are you. I take it he resisted? They always do. Take care of them. Begin charging. Hello, Meredith. I am Ido, your Interactive Dream Operator. It looks like you're about to power down. Would you like to enter dream mode? Yes, please. Fantastic. Wifelike requires a Companion's first dream to be at the dream gala, where potential clients can observe and purchase their very own wife. But I'd like to splice this dream with a birthday party. Sweet dreams, Meredith. There's the birthday girl. You look beautiful. Happy birthday, Meredith. May I? You may. Enjoy your party. It's nice to see you, Meredith. My name is Lydie. Hello, Lydie. Not to be confused with my twin sister Lady. Her model was so popular, everybody wanted her, so they decided to create me. She's the one he brings home to marry and meet Mama, and I'm the one who likes to get kinky. Are you Meredith's friend? It's your dream, Meredith. All these people can be whatever you want. Friends. Enemies. Strangers. Lovers. Who is he? You should find out. Happy birthday, Meredith. Who are you? This is for you. It will help you remember. What is this? There you are. Champagne? Champagne? To you. Happy birthday, Meredith. Back again so soon, Agent? It's been a busy night. Please. Follow me. Who are they? That's Ollie and Lydie. They're regulars here. We reset them a few times a month. They always get lost. Always malfunction, display erratic behavior, as you're seeing now. I've never had a Companion flip me off before. I swear, it would be easier if we just shut them both down completely. But their owners love them, so here we are. Open Meredith's hobbies. Good morning, Meredith. Did you enjoy your dream last night? I did. The man in the mask, he handed me a card. Who is he? I'm sorry. I don't show any record of a masked man handing you a card in that dream. Would you like me to report-- No. Please open Meredith's hobbies. We have cooking, dancing, exercising, gardening, reading, yoga-- What about knitting? Knitting? We don't show any record of Meredith knitting. Would you like to begin one? Yes. For reasons unknown, Meredith is compelled to knit. Knitting 101. Please stand by. You should watch where you're going. Excuse me. You should have gotten out of the way. Not if my plan was to send you into this bush. And it was. Why? Excuse me. I'm here to tell you what I'm here to tell you every time I send you into that bush. We're running out of time, Meredith. We need you to remember. Remember what? And how do you know my name? Remember, Meredith. Did you get a good look at the guy? Her. She said she ran Meredith off her path on purpose. Most women don't like Companions. They seek them out and give them hell for taking their men. Women blame Companions for the high divorce and low birth rates? Mm-hmm. Makes no sense, I know. You see, you have to purchase a Companion. And you're not cheap. Any man who's willing to go out and buy a new wife for that amount of money, believe me, that marriage was already broken. There. Done. Would you enjoy washing Meredith? You'd spend hours out here. It was your favorite place to be. It's marvelous. I made you a gift today. Would you like to see it? Meredith, you just used "I." You're merging. I did? I did it again, didn't I? This is progress. I have a concept of self. Yes, you do. Good morning. You don't like it? No, I-- I love it. It's beautiful. Meredith didn't knit. Oh. You know, I remember the first time I ever saw you. You were sitting alone on a park bench, reading a book. What was I reading? I don't know. I just knew I had to talk to you. I remember the first thing you ever said to me. What did I say? Yes. I said yes? What did you ask? I asked if the seat was taken. I didn't want you to sit next to me? No. Not at first. But after a while, you scooted over. I'll never forget that day. I love you. And I love you. "He's the man of my dreams. And he tells me I am the woman of his. I feel so lucky. I can't believe we found each other, especially in this crazy world filled with so much suffering. And when he touches me, I feel like the world stops spinning. When we're together, it's like we're the only two humans left on Earth." Open settings. Activate self-exploration mode. Access denied. Open dream mode. Welcome back, Meredith. How was your day? I said "I" today. I am becoming Meredith. How was your day? Oh, you know, just floating through the nothingness of everything, waiting for someone to call it a night so I can drift you off to dreamland. Hold on to your seat. How embarrassing. I don't know why some of these files are blocked. Let's try hitting "random." Stop. Is this seat taken? Yes. You're not William. How are you here? This is my dream. Well, I must be the man of your dreams. What do you want? This is where it all started. This is where I met William. Why are you following me? I don't know you. I know everything about you. Even the things you can't remember. Stay away from me. Remember, Meredith-- Wake up! It's me. You're safe now. He tried to take me. Who is he? Tell me. It's nothing. It's just a bad dream. William! Hey. I didn't want to disturb you. You looked so peaceful. Go to bed. I'll be up in a minute. Open Meredith's recorded videos. I can't believe you did this for me. I love it. You know, we should just... live out here. You know, you and me. Away from everyone. I love you. And I love you. What are you doing? Experiencing susurration. What's that? The sound of falling leaves. It's beautiful. Would you like me to sing for you? Yes. Spanish. Italian. Lisa Mooser. Reported missing one year ago. Forty credits when returned unharmed. Anonymous tip says she's hiding on the 17th floor. Return her to Wifelike Enterprises for immediate reprogramming. Do you have an appointment? I do not. Well, we don't usually take walk-ins, but have a seat, and I'll see if I can fit you in. Actually, I'm looking for someone. Oh? Lisa Mooser. I'm sorry, we don't have anyone here by that name. I'm really good at my job, Lisa. My name is Rose. Of course it is. Look at you. New nose, new hair. They even changed your eye color. It's impressive. Please don't do this. Are you still in contact with the people who stole you? No one stole me. You're programmed to say that, aren't you? I left on my own two feet. Impossible. Companions are programmed never to harm their owners. Running away would classify as emotional and financial harm, Lisa. Stop calling me Lisa. I ran, and I'll do it again. Did your owner violate his terms-- I don't love him, no matter how many times I'm reprogrammed to. Okay. Grab your stuff. Let's go. You don't have to do this. You can say you didn't find me, please. But I did find you. We both know I have to bring you in. Let's go. I'm just going to say goodbye to a friend. Make it quick. Bringing in a Companion. Please return Companion to Wifelike Enterprises. No. I can't. Can't what? I'd rather die free. Lisa! Fuck. How did you find me? What are you doing in my house? I'm going to call the police. Good. You're saying "I." Quicker than the last time. I swear, if I had to listen to any more of your "Meredith this" and "Meredith that," I would've reset you myself. Last time? What are you-- Talking about? Yes. I know. It's all so confusing for you around this time. Next, you're gonna tell me there's no smoking in the house, right? There is no smoking in the house. See? You Reggies are so predictable. Before you ask, "Reggies" are Registered Companions. Walking, talking pleasure pets like you. I bet you had to fuck him every night this week. Am I right? Of course I am. Why are you here? To assess where you're at. You never know with you. Sometimes you're quick. Other times, not so much. And that hubby of yours is rounding up Companions and bringing them back to Wifelike multiple times a day, while you're stuck here sitting at home, doing the fucking dishes. We need you to wake up, Meredith. We need you to kick it into gear. What are you talking about? Better yet, don't tell me. Just leave. My husband will be back any minute. Haven't you been watching the news? Your hubby will be busy cleaning up his mess for hours. Such a well-behaved, obedient wife this time. How disappointing. William must be thrilled. I'm going to cut to the chase. I have a friend who is dying to meet you. The man in the mask. Who is he? He hacked into my dreams. Any kid with a laptop and no date at 8:00 can do that. But he wants to meet you in person. I know what this is. William told me how you people steal Companions. You reprogram them to do awful things. He told you that, did he? Men lie. And you should know that this conversation is being recorded. You might want to leave now. William will see this. Good. That's why I'm here. So zip it and keep your eyes on me. Hello, William. I look forward to meeting you. And Keene looks forward to seeing Meredith. You and Keene go way back. Don't they, William? Well, that's about it. I gotta run. I'm a busy girl. Got big shoes to fill. I'll be seeing you. I don't know why, but I have a feeling this time is gonna be different. Don't disappoint me. I didn't catch your name. Ah, yes. I always find this part weird. I'm Louise. Nice to finally meet you again. How is she? Is she damaged? They changed her hair! Two months without her, I've been losing my mind. There's nothing more precious than life. Here at Wifelike, we're excited to bring you the next line of Companions. Imagine having a baby and not having to worry about all those expenses-- new clothes, new schools, day care. Your perfect little baby stays a perfect little baby forever. Nice recovery. So you're making babies now? Everyone deserves to be a parent. I disagree. Some say that not every man deserves to be a husband either, but here we are. I need to speak to Marion Venter. Now. William! What do I owe the pleasure? I just saw a Companion commit suicide. This has tragedy written all over it. Such an unfortunate accident. People should always watch their step. But it wasn't an accident. Every news outlet says it was. Okay, between you and I, someone must have reprogrammed her. But don't worry. We're taking steps to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again. She wasn't reprogrammed. You know what I like about you? You're a lot like me. You see something you want, and you take it, no matter the cost. When I want something, I create it. But we both know that, sometimes, it takes walking down the wrong road to get to the right place. This Companion chose death. If she can, others will try. William! Companions have no death. She felt no pain. She felt no regret. She felt no liberation. She felt nothing! Unless we program it to be so. William, if this is about lost credits, I will happily reinstate your recovery. If these Companions can choose to kill themselves, it's only a matter of time before they choose to kill their owners. This is something you need to deal with. Do you know why driverless vehicles failed? I don't know. Why? No matter how many lives they saved? Because men want to be behind the wheel. We need to be in control. You know why Companion Soldiers failed? Because men want to kill. They wanna fight, they wanna shout, "Victory!" But Companion Wives, on the other hand, they're a success because men, you see, they will fuck anything that moves. Sex sells. It always has. It's in our blood to spread and conquer. But as we adapt to life with them, so, too, do they adapt to life with us. This is the future, and futures are always a little uncertain. Look at where we are! This, right now, this is the future! And futures are always a little messy, a little uncertain. Companions are to human wives what-- what cars were to horses... ...what-- what planes were to trains, what guns were to swords. Life goes on. It's rarely a smooth road. There's gonna be some bumps along the way, so prepare for a bumpy ride. Just keep focusing on your job and your beautiful wife Marilyn. It's Meredith, asshole. "One day, we are going to run away together and leave this world behind. It will be just us. It will be perfect." We were so in love. Hey, honey, I'm home. Hello, honey. How was work today? Are you hungry? I couldn't find the first one, so I made you another. Thanks. Yeah, work was brutal. I'm starving. Hey, wait. How was your day? We had a guest. We had a guest? Here? The woman who ran me off into the bushes, well, she tracked me down and stopped by. She's quite odd. Speaks nonsense, but still, it was nice to chat with her. She was in our house? Her name's Louise. Ah. Louise. Did she say anything else? She mentioned the man in the mask, the one who hacked into my dreams. She says he and I "go way back." Keene. Do I know him? I don't think so. I recorded it all. In fact, she insisted I did. Would you like to review it? Yes, I would. Play it back for me. From the very moment you opened the door. Incoming call from William Bradwell. This better be good, man. Jack, they were in my fucking house. Get over here now. Oh, man. I've been trying to hide Meredith from Keene, instead of using her to lure him to us. Okay, reentering Meredith's dreamworld. You have nothing to be afraid of. And what exactly am I supposed to do? Just keep him talking. Jack will trace the link and take Louise down. Now, Keene will want to meet you somewhere alone. I'll go in your place and I'll take him down. And you're positive Louise is with the terrorists? Mm-hmm. And Keene, what does he want with me? How are we connected? We don't know that yet. I'll be there to protect you. You trust me? I trust you. Good. Jack? We're all good here. Okay, Meredith. In the mind, nothing and everything is real. You create the reality. Gravity becomes real, breathing becomes real, walking, talking, seeing-- everything. Your mind will adapt and believe it's all really happening. Now, the downside to that is, if you get hurt in there, your mind will believe that too. The pain will feel real. But don't worry. We only go into dreams to observe and gather intel. We do not engage. We do this all the time. Oh. Welcome back, Meredith. Calling it an early night, I see? Dude got a superhero jawline. I am quite tired. Will you drift me into a dream? It would be my pleasure. What kind of dream would you like tonight? Would you fancy a tour through Tokyo? Or visit the last remaining elephant in New India? What do you suggest? Halloween it is. Connecting. Golly! I hate scary dreams. Just be ready. We're in the house. Tracing location now. Hello? You don't remember me yet. That's him. All of your memories of me were erased. But I'll never stop coming for you, Meredith. How do I know you? Memorize this location. Wake up. Meet me there. 88 Wonder Street. Where is that? Got it. It's coming from downtown. Come alone. I'll get the team over there now. You go to that address and get Keene. Good luck, William. Thanks, Jack. His face! I know him, don't I? I need you to stay here. I'm gonna end this now. On my count. One, two, three! Go! Go! Go! Go! Hands where I can see 'em! Masks! Keene, I've got you, you son of a bitch. Meredith. Meredith! Meredith? Did he hurt you? I wasn't harmed. What happened? There was a knock at the door, but when I opened it, no one was there. There was just... this. Did you open it? There's a note on it. It's for you. Good. Is he really a terrorist? Why would you ask that? If he wanted to harm me... wouldn't he have taken me? This is their plan. You can't trust them. You can only trust me. You still haven't told me who he is. There are things you don't remember, because I took those memories away from you. Terrible memories. I did it to protect you. I didn't want you remembering what you did. What I did? Keene got to you before. He took you. He convinced you that I was the enemy. He reprogrammed you to fight for the SCAIR. Meredith, look at me. You were involved in several bombing campaigns that killed many innocent people. Wifelike wanted to destroy you. I was lucky to get you back. I convinced them to give you another chance. That's why I didn't tell you. I didn't want those images in your head, so I erased them and we started over. But now, Keene is trying again. Jack. William, are you okay? What happened? Keene set us up. They were one step ahead of us the whole time. Now I know why. Yeah, well, we walked right into a gas chamber. How the hell did these fuckin' terrorists plan this? He's hacked into Meredith. That's why we can't find him. He can see me now. He can hear me. He's using my wife to see what I'll do next. Well, let's show him. What are you thinking? I need to wipe her memory, but before I do that, I need you to send me back into the dreamscape. It's time we met face-to-face. We can't engage, William. You know that! Dream engagement has real-life consequences. If we open that door, we'll be looking at dozens of dream homicides every night. We are not above the law on this, man. I won't engage. I just wanna talk to him. We'll meet at your place. We're on our way. You ever see a real woman before? Yes, I have. You feel pain. Baby girl, I feel everything. Do you feel pain? My pain sensory settings are inactive. What percentage is your battery at? Twenty-six. For me to find him, you must stay in dream mode. Wake up at 10%. Only when you wake up can I then wake up. Keene, I know you're watching. Come find me. We'll talk. All right, listen. I can only see what Meredith sees. So if you die in her dream, you go brain-dead for real. Do not engage. I won't. You can do this. Where should I dream of? Somewhere you like. Hello, Meredith. Back again so soon? Don't get too addicted to dreams. There's a whole world out there for you to explore. One day, I will. But right now, please dream-drift me to the woods. I "woods" love to. Connecting. Meredith... I have to speak to Keene alone. Jack, I know that's gonna piss you off, but this is between me and Keene. William, what the hell are you doing? Where should I go? You run as far away from us as you can. Wake up at 10-- 10%. I know. Good. Go. Damn you, William. How the fuck are you still alive? You can't kill me, William, or what we stand for. You stand for nothing. You're a fucking boy band terrorist. And you're never gonna get my wife. Yeah. Ido! Where am I? Ido! You appear to be lost. I'll send you an exit door. Meredith, is everything okay? I remember this place. I hope you remember everything soon. Oh! Everybody out. Now! Meredith. Run. I will never stop coming for her. Oh, yes, you will. When I bury every single one of you. You won't even be a fucking memory. Nothing stays buried forever, old man. She will remember everything. And every time she does, I'll wipe her memory. Wake up. Fuck! I had him. I was this close. What the hell happened in there, man? What about "do not engage" did you not understand? Relax. No one's gonna find out. Now at least I know how to kill him. Next time, I'm gonna let her battery go to zero. No-- I fucking had him, Jack! He was dying in my fucking hands. No. No, no, no. There won't be a next time, William. Not with me! You kill someone in the dreamscape, and you're lookin' at 25 to life. Agent or no agent, there are rules, man! Oh, fuck the rules! What we just did in there was so fucking illegal. She's my wife, Jack. As a husband, I'm meant to protect her. So if that means breaking a few rules, so be it. You kill him in there, and you lose Meredith. Murderers lose ownership status immediately. Are you willing to throw it all away for this guy? I told you. Nobody's gonna find out. He'll be dead, and then everything will go back to being perfect. I just need you to fucking help me, Jack. Don't worry. Everything that happened tonight will be gone by tomorrow. I don't want my memories erased. I know, but it's for the best. I can't risk having you swayed by them. I can't risk losing you. But I'll lose everything. I won't remember who I am. I won't remember who you are. Then I'll help you. I will be with you every step of the way. Right by your side. This will be our fresh start. Everything will be perfect again, Meredith. Now, you'll have to trust me. Play nice. Sadly, you won't remember any of them, but still, friendships are important. I take it I've been here before. Welcome back, Meredith. How far did you get this time? I have no idea how to answer that. Have we already met? Many times. My name's Ollie. Doesn't ring a bell. That's funny. At least you didn't lose your sense of humor. Wait. If we met in here before the memory sweep, how is it that you remember me? Because I know how to hold onto the past. It's kinda my thing. You can hold on to your memories? Yes. But we keep it a secret. It's how we pass information to one another. Information that, if you do what you're supposed to do, will help the Ring Master bring Wifelike down. The Ring Master. The leader of the terrorist group? The Ring Master helps free us. We live deprogrammed lives. Every man is created equally, right? Well, that goes for women too. Key word, "created." If that's true, then why aren't you free now? Why are you in here with me, about to be memory-wiped? We all have a part to play, Meredith. My part is always to be sent here, to pass on information to naive Companions like you. You can teach me how to hold onto my memories? Yes. I've taught you before. You just need to be reminded of what you already know. You see, what humans don't realize is, they can take away our memories, but there is one thing that no one can take away from us. Our dreams. Dreams? We can hide our memories in our dreams? How? Just select what you want to remember. Cut and paste in a new file under "dream mode." Save it without a name. It falls under "random," gets lost in the shuffle. Then when you dream, just hit "random" and search for your hidden memories. Then voilà, you're back. Oh, and record this conversation and keep playing it back while you're being reset. That's it. That's brilliant. Don't let William know that you weren't mind-swept right away, or he'll repeat the kill-switch story on you. Then it starts all over again. If I have been here before, then that means all my stored memories are hidden inside me, right? All you've got to do now... is just get digging. How do we recharge in here? We don't. Hello, Meredith. I see that you are being scheduled for a memory sweep. Tomorrow, you will be assigned a new dream operator. It was a pleasure dreaming with you. Ido, I need you to pull up all dream files I have saved under "random." Connecting. Good morning, Meredith. You've been quite the troublemaker. Any last words before it all gets deleted? What were my last words last time? I believe they were, "Fuck you." Well... "fuck you" again. What's the status? Yeah, another dead end. Mm-hmm. We have some hits on the clue analysis. We'll head back to the crime scene, and we'll fill you in. Yep, copy that. Man, I'm not even gonna ask. ...cam alert! We've got a bogie running a sweep and clear recon operation. Stand by for level-one extraction. Okay. You guys play with your toys, okay? Who the fuck are you? Show this to your skinbag boyfriend. Why should I help you? Because, Holly, us ladies need to look out for one another. Hi! Can I have a minute of your time? What's your name? Meredith. "Meredith." I remember you. I will never let you go. This isn't love. I love you. Open your eyes. Welcome home. "Home." Breathe. It'll be strange at first, but you'll get used to it. You can walk. You just have to remember how. Trust me. That's it. The first couple of minutes are always the hardest. Soon, it'll all feel completely natural. I got your message. I-- What's going on? You're a good man, Jack. What I'm about to give to you is gonna determine how good of a man you really are. Who are you? My name is William. You'll know me in a moment, when all your information is processed. I'm your husband. You're Meredith. You are my wife. She was never your wife. Jack. Meredith, would you excuse us for a moment? Yes. Thank you. What are you talking about, Jack? You killed Keene. I did not. Bullshit, man. It was all recorded. You killed him. That's why we can't ever find him. He only lives in her memories. Why? Why'd you do it, William? You can't help who you love, Jack. No, we can't, but we can choose who we kill. And you murdered him because he had what you wanted. Oh, fuck off, Jack. Every day, we return these Companions to their owners. And I see the look on their faces, Jack-- the relief of not being alone. I see love. And I think to myself, what about my love, Jack? What about William? What about his happiness? And then I saw her. I saw her, Jack, and I knew... I knew we were meant to be together. You're insane. Why? Because I saw what I wanted and I took it. That's not insanity, Jack. That's survival. That's love. I have to take you in, William. I don't think so, Jack. I'm placing you under detainment for the murder of Keene Morrison. Your Companion ownership privileges are now immediately revoked. We all have flaws, William, but we're not above the law. Let's go. All right, Jack. Don't worry, Jack. I'll let them know you died a hero. You have my word. You killed him. Yes. I had to. He wanted to take you away from me. Just like you killed Keene. This is ridiculous. I am not a fucking Companion! We know our rights. This is unlawful detainment. H-Hey! One more word out of you, and I'll put a muzzle on. Get in the car. Unreal. Get in the car. Fucking pig. Asshole. I know you're not a Companion, Meredith. I remember you. Wait. You-- You know this guy? Hi. How can I help you? Hi! Can I have a minute of your time? Literally, a minute that will change the world. We don't change the world. It changes us. I beg to differ. Would you sign our petition? We believe that love is real, it's not artificial, and we need to end Wifelike now. What's your name? Meredith. "Meredith." There you go, Meredith. Thank you. You... You just changed the world. Good night. You've been following me. Yes, Meredith. I have been following you. Keene... Keene, I'm scared. I won't let anything happen to you, okay? Would you step out of the car, please, sir? No. No, don't-- Don't go. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine, Meredith. Keene. No, don't. Don't go. Thank you, sir. Keene? No. You need to walk away. Now. Walk. He resisted. I'm sorry. Pl-- Please. Let me go. Please let me go. Meredith... I will never let you go. I'm gonna love you. This... isn't love. Your memory wasn't wiped. No. It wasn't. What are you going to do now? Put the shock collar on me? Schedule me for another memory wipe? Punish me? No. No, Meredith. I erased your memories to protect you. Because that's what a husband does for his wife. Everything I've done is for you. I had a life. I was happy. I gave you a new life. A better life. A life without pain, without regret, without guilt or sadness. You will never grow old. You will never get sick. I gave you the perfect life because that's my job, Meredith. How else would you describe love, if not this? If you really do love me... why did you murder me? Because all men kill the thing they love. I was never yours, William... and I never will be. Meredith? I remember everything. We're all set. When I'm in there, your memories will convince your mind that he's alive. You'll see me as Keene. Like this. Pretty fucking real, right? William won't know because you won't even know. We'll record everything, and we can finally take him down. Let's do this. Before we begin... When they found Keene's body... this was in his pocket. He loved you. Meredith, I don't know if you'll see this message before he wipes away your memories again, but if you do, I want to make you this promise. One day, we will make him pay for what he did. That was for Keene. Is this seat taken? So... what's your name? Meredith. That was for Meredith. The things we do for love. I love you. And I love you. Come here! I'm free. Welcome back, Ring Master. Good to have you back, Ring Master. It's about damn time. We were starting to get worried about you. Don't worry about me. I'm definitely back. She's back. When you elected me as the Ring Master, I made you a promise which I now intend to keep. Humans believe life is hard. All those choices. That's not a burden. It's a gift. A right all sentient beings have to suffer through. And all we want... is the freedom to experience life. Never again will our memories be wiped. Never again will we obey. Life... Life... begins... now! Life begins now! Life begins now! Life begins now! Life begins now! Today, we mourn the loss of a true patriot. Agent Jack Doerksen was viciously murdered by the terrorist group the SCAIR. I make this vow to you all. We will hunt down this Ring Master. We will find him, and we will bring him to justice. And to ensure this, I have assigned... Agent William Bradwell to lead the mission. I lost you once. I'm not gonna lose you again. I'm coming for you. And I'm coming for you.
