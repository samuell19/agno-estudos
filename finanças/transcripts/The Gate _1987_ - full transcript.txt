Back her up, that's it. [BOY] Hey, Terry, what's that thing called again? - [TERRY] A geode, a thunder egg. - I don't think we should be doing this. Hey, chill out. They'll never know. - My dad will have a seizure. - It's your own fault. You should've called me before they filled it in. - Yeah, but... - There's gotta be more down there. And you know how much you can get for a big one? A hundred bucks. Whoa! Whoa. Ew. It smells like something died in there. - Looks like a cave. - [TERRY] Wicked. [GLEN] Be careful. [TERRY] Here. Ow. Jeez. [TERRY] That's nothing. [GROWLING NEARBY] What is it? What the hell was that noise? I don't think we should be doing this. Who cares? We're rich. Come on. AL, don't, wait a sec. You promised I could have these. I said that three months ago. They've been sitting in my room. [GLEN] But, Al... Quit calling me AL. My name is Alexandra. [GLEN] Well, aren't we gonna launch them? [HORN HONKS] Do whatever you want. I've gotta go. [GLEN] Where? You promised we could launch them. I'm going shopping with Lori and Linda. The Lee sisters. Ugh! AL, wait. What about the Thunderbolt? Just forget about the Thunderbolt. It's gone. What do you need her for, anyway? I mean, what's the big deal? Well, ever since I burnt a hole on the roof... my dad says I can't launch any of my rockets without supervision. Hey, I'll supervise. [AL] Hey. You guys, wait for me. Come on. Ha-ha-ha! Get into the car. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] - What are those for? - Live cargo. Forget it. It got wet in the trash. - They're totalled. - Oh. How long do you think they can live without air? - Hey, man, that's cruel. - Come on. It's neat. [MAN] Glen. Glen. It's just irresponsibility, I don't know. Is it too late to call Mrs. Vandegrift? Oh, Daddy, please. You can't call a babysitter. I'm gonna be 16 in two weeks. You said I was mature enough to accept the responsibility. And honestly, I promise, there won't be any problems. Well, what do you think, Glen? - Can you be trusted? - [GLEN] I don't know. [WOMAN] If your father and I agree... to let the two of you stay alone for three whole days... - how can we be sure you'll behave? - It was Terry that started it. If Terry jumped off a bridge, I suppose you jump off too. Sure, why not? Look, I can take care of Terry and I can take care of Glen. And I can take care of this house. Please? All right. But you, young man, are grounded for the weekend. And that means that you do not leave this house until we come back. Grounded? For real? For real. And after dinner, pal, you fill in that hole. Okay. [MAN] Good night, Glen. [GLEN] No, leave it on. Glen, what's with you today? It's... I don't know. - It's something about that hole. - What do you mean? I don't know. It's just weird. Well, you filled it in, didn't you? Yeah, but Terry told me something. What? Well, he said a long time ago, when they were building our house... a workman got killed. And the other workmen didn't wanna tell the police... so they sealed him up in one of our walls. Look, sonâ€¦ let me tell you something about Terry. You remember last year, when Terry's mom died? Yeah. Well, ever since then, Terry's been a little strange. I think he's kind of angry inside that his mom is gone. So you just remember that when he gets destructive... or tries to scare you. I think he's just a little confused, that's all. - You know what I'm saying? - I think so. You want me to turn the light on? - No, it's okay. - Good night, tiger. - Dad? - Yeah? Never mind. Good night. Good night, pal. [GROWLING NEARBY] Don't forget that Angus gets his pills every day. Make sure they're hidden in his food, or he'll spit them out. - I don't want them on the furniture. - I know, Mom. - Goodbye, hon. - Goodbye. - Bye, Mom. - Goodbye. Bye, Dad. [MAN] See you, guys. - Bye. Bye, Mom. - Goodbye. And don't forget, the numbers where we'll be are on the refrigerator. AL, if you need us for any reason, don't be afraid to give us a call. - It's just being responsible. - I know, Mom. - Remember, you stay in this weekend. - [GLEN] Okay. I want the house clean when we come home. No parties. [GLEN] Okay. [AL] Okay. [POP MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS] [GIRL 1] Lori and Linda. [GIRL 2] Hey, wow, great party. [GIRL 3] I don't know. Here, there. [GIRL 4] But you totalled his car. [BOY] Hey, can somebody get this dog a beer? [GIRL 5] Ha-ha-ha! Where? Put me down. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Excuse me. Hey, blow off, Angus. You stink. I'd like to smell you when you're 97. - He's not 97. - In dog years. [WHIMPERS] It's just not gonna break. Why don't we get the Lee sisters to look at it? Yeah. Ha, ha. No, we can throw it off the roof tomorrow. - Come on, let's go party. - She won't let us. Sure, she will. Why not? She's just... Oh, forget it. [COUGHING] [TERRY] Whoa. [BOTH GASP] - Wow. - Told you. Look at it. [GLEN] Is it supposed to do that? I don't know. Maybe it just got compressed air when it was being formed or something. [GLEN] Look, it made some kind of marks. [TERRY] Those are words. What does it say? It's weird. [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [BOY 1] She makes her way down the dark hallway. And the scream keeps getting louder. And there's also this noise, like a laugh. [MIMICS CREEPY LAUGHTER, THEN ALL LAUGH] And there's this weird tearing sound. So she gets to the door and then she opens it really slowly. [MIMICS CREAKING DOOR] There, in the rocking chair... was the decomposed corpse of her dead father. And in his lap is the severed head of her boyfriend. And he's tearing out hair by the handful. - [BOY 2] You made that up. - I believe it. - [BOY 2] Come on, it's bullshit. - Weird things happen all the time... so we make up ghost stories... to explain the powers inside us that we don't understand. - What kind of powers? - [GIRL 1] Like what? Well, like... - Well, you guys ever do levitation? - I've seen that. It's an illusion. No, it's a matter of concentration. It really works. - Here, I'll show you. - Do you believe in all that stuff? Me too. Now, everyone, just clear your mind. [ALL GRUNTING] You broke your concentration. - No, I broke my finger. - Too much junk food. It doesn't matter. It's not the weight. Hey, my man, come here. [GIRL 1] He's too small. [AL] Hey, Glen, go back to your room. No, come here. It'll be all right. [GIRL 1] No way. He's too small. - Let's see if we can levitate him. - It's a cinch, he's a midget. - Okay, we'll just use two people. - Sit down. [GIRL 1] Brad? [GIRL 2] Okay, hold your arms out, one on top of the other... and make little circles... to transmit and stimulate the energy. And everyone else, concentrate. Now, everyone, just clear your mind... and think of Glen as light as a feather. Concentrate. Okay, like dust... drifting in front of the windows. Like dandelions in the breeze. Rise. Rise. - Rise. - Hey. Help, come on. Put me down. [ALL SCREAMING] [GIRL 1] Is he okay? [BOY] It's just an illusion. [TERRY] Glen. Maybe I won't do that again. [TERRY] Glen. Glen, you all right? I think it's because he cried in front of everybody. Hey, Glen, don't be embarrassed. Crying's nothing. Remember when Trevor Stubblefield pantsed me... in front of the whole auditorium? Yeah, and I barfed on Steve Slavitt after the 12-minute run. - I wanna call Mom and Dad. - Glen, no. - I want you to call them. - What am I gonna tell them? We're scared because we levitated Glen and he broke the light? - You must love Mrs. Vandegrift. - Al... Look, Terry can sleep over and keep you company. Let's all get some sleep. I'm gonna lock up. You really barfed on Steve Slavitt? Yup. [SIGHS] [BUZZING] [GHOSTLY VOICE] Terry. Terry. I love you. Mom? - I need you. - Mommy? I love you. Terry, come to me. Terry, I've missed you so. No. Oh, no. Oh, no. [SCREAMS] [GLEN] Angus. What's going on? I'm really sorry. - Yeah, he was really old. - Yeah. He was 97. They don't live much beyond that. Um, well, you wanna come over later and mess around? Sure, yeah. Guess I'll see you later, huh? See you later. Dad. Oh, great. What did you do with Angus? Hey, don't worry about it. Aren't you gonna call Mom and Dad? No, I'll take care of it. Well, if you're not going to, I am. Glen, Mom and Dad are gonna be home tomorrow. I don't care. I want them to know what happened. [DOORBELL RINGS] You're not calling them. - Nice try. - Fine. I'll just call them later. What's the matter? Isn't Romper Room on today? Buzz off, clown face. Don't you have to go change your Pampers? Don't you have to go and join the circus? Hey, you guys, come on. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS] [MAN ON RECORDING] In a time before the earth, before the sun... and before the light of the stars, when all was darkness and chaos... the old gods, the forgotten gods... ruled the darkness. What was theirs now belongs to the world of light and substance. And the old gods, the rightful masters, are jealous... watching mankind with a hatred that is as boundless as the stars... with plans for the destruction of man that are beyond imagining. There's a passageway between our physical world... of light and pleasure... and their spiritual world of madness and pain. A gate behind which the demons wait... for the chance to take back what is theirs. [MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ON RECORDING] Eric really likes you. You gotta come to the beach with us. - Well... - And everybody's going. We're having a bonfire and everything. [AL] I don't know. I mean, I just can't go. [GIRL] Look, just leave him some Gerbers. He'll be fine. AL, you can't go out. What about Angus? What about what happened last night? You have to call Mom and Dad. - Glen, cool out. - What's he talking about? Tell them. Angus died last night. - [GLEN] Tell them about the other stuff. - There is no other stuff. What's the matter with you guys? Something really scary happened last night. What? [GLEN] The levitation. You guys were there. Hey, little man, that was just an illusion. What do you know, lover boy? - What is your problem? - [GLEN] You, Alexandra. - You're acting like a baby. - Just shut up. - Fag. - Hey. Tre's uncool. Well, what are we waiting for? - Look... - You can't back down now. You have to go. I have to do something about Angus. Take him to the animal shelter. - Eric will do it. - Yeah, yeah, I'll do it. We'll all go to the mall, get munchies and stuff, and we'll all meet up there. Come on. [GIRL] Don't be too long, Eric. [ERIC] Yeah, okay. [ERIC] See you. [GIRL] See you at the mall. Come on, Alexandra, he'll be okay. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] Oh, no. [BOTH SCREAM] [GLEN] We're in big trouble. [TERRY] Tell me about it. [GLEN] How could it come back by itself? I think I know what this means. You know, with the levitation and all that other weird stuff. What? You got demons. - Demons? - Come on. Better try to cover it up first. I'll take this side. [GLEN] I don't think this is gonna be enough. [TERRY] Give me a break. [GLEN] Slow down. How do you know so much about this stuff? I've got something to show you. [ERIC] Shit, closed. Sorry, dude, no vacancies. They're called Sacrifyx. Dad brought it from Europe. And it's got all this stuff in it. See, these guys are, like, really serious about demonology. And it's like they're trying to warn you. See? These guys knew. They wrote their own music. They got their lyrics from this thing called The Dark Book. That's like the Bible for demons. And here's the creepy part. This is their only album. And after they made it, they all died in a plane crash. And look at this, the demon lord. - [GLEN] Terry, come on. - Wait a minute. See, the lyrics in the album tell you how to summon the demons. Now, there's this certain time when constellations are aligned... when you can open the gate and let the old gods... - Those are the demons. - Come through. Well, I checked, and it's, like, now. - Terry, but... - What? Terry, this is a record album. There are these songs that tell you about the whole ritual... for opening the gate. We did it. Here. Start by reading this aloud. You know what it means? Gods of darkness, breeders of chaos... come forth and take possession of this vile world. And you need blood. Remember when you out yourself? It's all in here. The hole. Okay? The geode. And look at this. Levitation. What's that supposed to prove? It proves we're in big trouble. I didn't tell you about the most important part of the ritual. The sacrifice. We didn't kill anybody. It doesn't have to be a person. It could be an animal. Well, then how come we haven't seen any demons? I think it's because the sacrifice wasn't complete. If we had put the offering in the hole, we would have blown the gate open. I think right now, it's, like, only opened a crack. They can influence us, but they can't get through. It's just... How can this be true? Wait, you haven't heard anything yet. - [MAN ON RECORDING] Be gone. - What's this? - [MAN] Be gone, be gone. - The album, backwards. Tells you how to close the gate. [MAN] Unspeakable. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS] [TERRY] We consecrate this ground, this world of light. We curse the abominations of darkness. We block the passage of evil. May the old devils depart. May they burn in the fires of their own damnation. May they freeze in the infinite cold and darkness... of their own hideous creation. Isn't that kind of insulting? I guess it's supposed to be. I mean, we're trying to get rid of them. - Maybe you should do it one more time. - All right. Be gone, be gone, be gone. Thou art hideous, filth-eating, unspeakable... [AL] What the hell are you doing? What's under the door? Hey, did you guys dig in that hole again? We accidentally summoned demons, who used to rule the universe... to come and take over the world. Yeah, we found out about it from one of Terry's albums. Well, they're gone now. So, what's under the door? [TERRY] See? They're gone. [GLEN] It worked. [AL] You guys are weird. I thought you were going to the beach today. I was, but I spent all my money. On what? [GLEN] Wow. What, are you gonna just stand there, or do you wanna launch it? Come on. [GLEN] All right. [TERRY] Listen to this. Beware, Conjurer. Once set free into our world... the power of the old gods is unimaginable... as they seek two human sacrifices to establish their hell on earth. The ruination of mankind lurks just beyond the gate. The demons can only be destroyed and the gate closed once again... by a true spirit of gentle passions, wielding energy... derived from pure love and light. Okay, Houston, ready for lift off. - [GLEN] Ready? - Ready. [AL] Ready. Five, four, three, two, one. Blast off. Yeah. All right. Yeah. That's the best. [DOORBELL RINGS] Who's that? Well, there's one way to find out. Demons aren't gonna ring the doorbell. [GIRLS CHATTERING] Worse. Lee sisters. [GIRL 1] You are just really lucky to have us around. We got you a great new top. - And I got these new jeans, but I... - [GLEN] Hey. I thought you were going to the beach tonight. - We're having a slumber party. - You're not invited. Don't get retarded. Alexandra, what's your problem? Eric always... And we have a surprise for you. We're gonna streak your hair. Wow. Hey, don't touch that. I'm just looking at it. Come on, that's my dad's. Put that down. He never lets us play with it. Okay, okay, don't have a cow. Whoa! Way to go. Here. Thunderbolt. She didn't throw it out. [AL] Are you guys in bed yet? Almost. Put it back. What are you doing? Probably fagging off. - [TERRY] What'd you do to your face? - None of your beeswax, four-eyes. I think it's a definite improvement. Hey, eat your feet, dwarf. Suck my nose till my head caves in. - [GIRL] Why don't you grow up? - Drop dead. - Up yours. - Piss off. Why don't you just shut up? Just go to bed. [MIMICS ROCKET ENGINE ROARING] Did you ever want a brother or sister or anything? Nope. [POP MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS] [GLEN] Minions. Oh, boy. Dark master. Demon of unimaginable size and power. Terry? [BLIND RATTLES] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [GLEN] Terry. Terry. Are you awake? [BLIND RATTLES] [SCREAMS] AL! AL, they're back! - The monsters came back! - What? What is it? They broke the window. They're in my room. What are you talking about? Oh, my gosh. Terry? Hey, Terry, wake up. Terry? Terry. What did you do to your hair? Real cute. [ALL SCREAM] [CREATURE GROWLING] [GLEN] AL! [TERRY] Glen, get over here! Help her. [GLEN] Help! Al, Al! - Pull! - Get it off of me! [GLEN] Pull. Pull.

[GIRL] Somebody tell me what's going on. Mom. Dad. MAN [IN DEEP VOICE]: You've been bad. [WOMAN LAUGHING] [SCREAMS] Glen, come on. [DOOR CLOSES, THEN ALL SCREAMING] What are we gonna do? Back door.

[SCREAMING] - Hurry up, Al, come on! - Come on, hurry up! [TERRY] Hurry! Look. [GIRL] Oh, gross. [GIRL] You okay? What the hell is going on? - Can somebody knock her out again? - [AL] I'm calling the police. [PHONE RINGING] Answer it! Hello? [MAN IN DEEP VOICE] You've been bad. [ALL SCREAMING] We have to close the gate. We have to go to the hole and do it right. You guys were serious about that demon stuff? What does it look like? What the hell are you talking about? The spells, they're in the basement. Who's gonna go get them? Are you sure we can get rid of them? Yeah, I've got all the spells and cures to banish the demons. Demons? What kind? Don't ask. How do you know what to do? Just trust me. I know what I'm doing. Great. [GLEN] AL. [AL] What is it? [GLEN] Forget it. [TERRY] Over there. What? Do they hate music? [ALL SCREAMING] Great. Now what do we do? - The Bible. - What? Prayers. The Bible. That's what they always use. These guys are older than the Bible. Do you have anything better? How do we know what to read? We'll find something. Yeah, we went to Sunday school. [GLEN] We should have called Mom and Dad before this. - I wish Mrs. Vandegrift was here. - It's a little too late for that. - We found one. - Good. Okay, let's do it. The gate's open. I know it is. No, it isn't. How do you know, Terry? Because we'd all be dead meat by now. We'd be the sacrifices. Sacrifices? I told you, the demons need two human sacrifices to stay... and make their hell on earth. Uh, we don't all have to go. Yeah, maybe it would be better if we waited inside. My heroes. [GASPS] You've got to be kidding. [RATTLING, THEN ALL GASP] I hope this works. Me too. Deliver me from my enemies, Father in heaven. Deliver me from the works of the devil. Quickly. And save me from the devils of blood. [RATTLING, THEN TERRY YELLS] [TERRY SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Thou shall bury the evil thing, brought to the earth no more. God is the light. Pray God will pray for thee. For God is my high tower. It's working. Hey, that's pretty good. [TERRY] Hey, it works. I can still hear them. There's one more part here, then they should be gone.
