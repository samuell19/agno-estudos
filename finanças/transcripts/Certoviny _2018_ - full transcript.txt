You can't breathe in here! Something probably blew up. Out of nowhere, kaboom. Open the vents! The gate! Quick, open the gate! Air it out, quick! What the! And what is this here? Gobbledy-goop smackedy-poop! I'll clean it up, Your Grace. Don't get upset. Your horns'll start hurting again. I have to get upset! There's a mess everywhere! Everyone over here! - Get in place! -Is it everyone? -6,8,3,7... -Well? - I just lost count! - This will be cleaned up! Right now! It's a mess. It stinks and is filthy here. Sweep it up! Pour water in the furnaces. But be careful. So no soul slips out. Blacken those battered horns and corners with soot, bring in kindling. - Chop it! And air it out! - Get going! Oops... Hey, here. Alert, alert! - It's running away! Catch it! - Grab it, it's getting away. Aha, I've got ya... I haven't. And I've got ya! Close the door! Close the gate! I can't believe it! Such a beautiful sinful soul! How did you let it get away, you morons! Get ready! I'm gonna turn you all into salamanders and spiders. No, pieces of coal! Filthy scum! Who let it out? Hmm? Them. Coalface, Ashen-head. They were chasing each other around, they knocked over the cauldron. I saw it. Come here! Here! Both of you! Is it true? It is, it is! So you admit your guilt, do you? At least that. What punishment do you choose? Your Highness, they're just silly youth, cocky, but they're devils and they'll get up to some devilry I'll fix them and everyone'll be amazed. Too late! I'll fix them myself! You will go into the world and before the moon fully rotates once, each will bring one sinful soul to hell. Or I'll lock you up in the prison of Hell! For 100 years! - So this is the world. - It's beautiful! It really is beautiful, beautiful! - Nobody told us in Hell how nice it was. - Yea, probably afraid we'd like it here. I guess I already like it here in the world. Me too! Look! Get down! And... jump. What the, what's... Charlie, what's that? Oh God, go, Charlie, onward! Charlie, you disobedient little, Charlie, what the devil have...? What was that? What is all this monkey business? Climb down at once, you brats! Should I come up there for you two? Oh what, what... Oh God, devils. No no no! - That was cool. - Do you think he has any sin? Probably, because he smells weird. Hey, I like you. Let's go. - Let's go! - Out into the world we go. It's beautiful. Let's go over there! No, let's go there! There are people over there. The sins will be there! Ladies... and... Quiet, do you hear that? Someone's coming. We can catch a ride. - What's that? - How horrible. Run! Run! Hell's coming. Help! Save yourself if you can! Save your souls, everyone! Wait, person! We'll take you with us. Pretty excited, aren't they? Sure are, I guess they've never seen two nice young devils. - She completely lost her head. - Crazy person. And she said how horrible. - And why did everyone dash off so fast? - We'll ask somewhere else. What's that? Oh my God, devils! - Person, wait! Person! - Devils! - Hello, water person! - Devils, devils, devils! Mr Water Goblin, don't be afraid. We just wanted to ask if you knew why everyone runs away from us. Everyone runs away from devils. Even fish in a pond. That's strange, isn't it? In Hell, they tell us we're quite good looking. That's right, we did quite good. - Maybe we don't look like people. - Yea, when we dress like people, nobody'll know where we're really from. - How about this? - Good idea. - Me... no, no! - Probably not that. So something else. Help, help! - We're taking your fish! - But we'll leave you the horse here. Save me someone! I can't swim! Look. - And here's our sin. - The old lady's stealing. Old lady... - Stealing wood, are you? â€œWhat? The person is deaf. - If you were stealing these sticks! - These? Not a chance. Our ranger is very nice and lets me pick some fallen wood to keep warm in winter. And don't you have any sins? - Maybe just a small one? - What sin could I have? Honestly none. - And aren't you lying? - As God as my witness. Maybe sometimes I complain a bit about life. - That's not a sin though. - No, it's not. I'm old. I can't carry much. By the time I get this to the cottage, it'll be evening. I haven't got the strength anymore. - We've got strength, we sure do. - Nothing's difficult for us. Watch. You guys are young. What? Where'd this nice wheelbarrow come from? Come on, old lady. Have a seat. - And hold on, old lady. - I'm holding. We're moving. We're moving! - Where'd you say your cottage was? - There. -Couldn't you live a bit closer? - What? -That we're really moving. - Sure are... That was a nice ride, like with a princess. Well, and now I'll be staying right here. Heavy old lady... ouch. I don't even know how to repay you. Perhaps a bit of garlic soup? Or a smell cross on your forehead. I still have two pancakes from yesterday. - We'll be making our way onwards. - If you don't have any sin. Ugh, that scared me, you cursed boys... You beautiful rascals. - Nice old lady, wasn't she? - Yea. How do we have so many sinful souls in Hell? Where'd we get them all from? I was also asking myself if we were in the right world. Everyone here is so nice. What if we were in heaven? What did you say? I'll put you all in heaven, you mischievous imbeciles. You're really messing it up. Wrong, wrong, everything wrong. Instead of harming and guiding people to bad acts, you are doing good! You did good taking the carriage from the priest. Scaring the girls and fisherman. - But then! - But then? You gave away the horse. Helped the old lady. You took her home and gave her wood! And don't say it's not true! Because she was really nice. And really old. Enough! You're supposed to bring harm! Do this one more time, you'll head back down to face Luciper himself! Then you'll be surprised, idiot devils. I'm warning you, idiots! Do some harm and now! Giddy up, buddy, a bit more and we're home. Come on, come on... slower, Ok go. Wait, stop, buddy. Wait. We'll take all this off you and that'll be it. Mama will be shocked. I got such a nice log. What joy, my boy. I'll give you some water and wipe you dry. He's got a nice log, he told the horse. So let's chop it all up into pieces. - Now no more beautiful log. No more joy! - We did him real harm, didn't we? What the... This is impossible! It was a log and now it's not! It's a miracle! Heaven has had mercy! The heavens huh... Simple-minded fool! Come on! A miracle, a heavenly miracle in our own courtyard. - Hey there! - Hello, are you all looking for workers? - By chance? I'll ask. Mr Waters! Mr Waters. What is it? - Hello, Mr Waters. - What is it? We came to offer you help. You surely need some helpers. I don't need any bums. Head on back where you came from. But you do, you just don't know it yet. You filthy beggar. Lecture me will you? Get on, or I'll give you a whooping! - You'd have to catch us first. - Old man... Cheeky vagabond, coming right up to your house. What are you staring at? Not enough work? Want some more? So this one. This will be the one. Definitely. So, another way. And go... Mr Waters! - Mr Waters! Quick! - What? Why are you yelling? Why are you standing there? Get them in the courtyard! No, no, myself. You close the gate! Go on! Come on, come here, my beauties. Come on, come on, come on. Don't be afraid, don't be afraid. Where'd you all come from? Such beauties not even the governor has! - Good afternoon. - Hello, Hanicka. Who'd you all run away from, huh? Doesn't matter. I'll take care of you myself. My sweeties. What are you staring at? Close the gate so they don't run away. You can't, Mr Waters. They aren't ours. Someone might be looking for them. What's your role, boy! A farm hand is gonna lecture me? That'll be the day. Jan is right, Daddy. You should return them. Quiet. You understand that much! Get to work. Don't you have some to do? Lookie here, Mr Waters. Quite a secret! Now that's the surprise you mentioned back in the pub? I know you're adding them into Hanicka's dowry for good measure, right? Why else would you have them, right? Wow, we'll ride them to the church, Mr Waters. So everyone oozes with envy. Well, it was supposed to be a surprise, but now you've seen them, well... And you, get them in the stable. Tend to them real nice. Get them some feed! And on the double! You've made me very happy, Mr Waters. It'll be a wedding nobody'll ever forget. Where in the world did you find them? They must've cost a few gold pieces! Well, you know they weren't for free. Come on, kind horses. I'd rather be with you a 1000x more than with those two. Where's my betrothed? She doesn't greet her groom-to-be? She doesn't bring roast meat. No beer? Hana, where are you! Beer. - You act like you weren't happy to see me. - I'm not! You don't love me and I don't love you and you know that well. Love, don't love, hmph! Who cares! - So why do you want me as your wife? Why? Because when your farm joins with mine, I'll be the richest farmer far and wide. And then, I'll need a wife on the farm who will do all the work. That's why! - Here. Hanicka was baking this morning. - With cottage cheese? You're doing it on purpose when you know I like it with poppy. Is that what the mayor's daughter bakes? Hana! Get back here! Do you hear me? I actually like it when she does that. Once she's mine, I'll tame her. She's a crazy girl. I'll give her something to pout about! Horse and boy ride into battle Nary do they flee Horse and boy ride into battle Nary do they flee Joyous horse happily dying Mother good is strongly crying Lost at twenty-three Lost at twenty-three Jan! Tell me what I should do. Hoofington acts as if I were already his. - But I'd rather die than become his wife. - Don't worry. Above all, don't cry. And try to put the wedding off as long as possible. I'll think of something. Hana! Hanicka! Hanicka! It's rude to run away like that. It'll just offend him and anger your father. - I'm not marrying him! - What can you do. Your Father has decided and so it will be. There's not a nicer way to say it. Wait here. I'll go get you some clean water. - That's really sad, isn't it? - It is. Could make one cry. Two. We can't just leave it like that. We have to help them somehow. - How dare you! - Your Evil Highness... Do you not know why you're in this world? That you should look for sinful souls? - Your Majesty, we have two sinful souls. - Almost. -Picked them out! - But you clearly don't have them! - A few more days and they'll be there. - These ones are sinful, boy are they! - So do it. Time's almost out. After all, it shouldn't be that difficult. Every person is sinful. - Not everyone, Your Highness. - You dare to talk back to me? - Tell me, who? - Jan and Hanicka, Your Highness, not them. - I've got a sixth sense about this. - Me too. When I say everyone is sinful, it means everyone! And that's the truth since the beginning of time! - Or do you doubt it? - I do. Me too. I do too. Ok, so let's bet! Try them! If they resist the temptations of this world and prove their love is stronger than money and power as you claim, your punishment will be forgiven and I won't lock you up in any of Hell's prisons. - Deal? - Deal! Fire hell gold, this deal's been sold. And if you lose, so... Jan, we're going crawfishing. Wanna go with us? - Cant. Maybe Sunday afternoon. - Jan, the watermill on the stream broke. - The woodpecker broke it. - So bring it here and I'll fix it. - So you'll turn us into black coal. - And you'll be locked in Hell forever! And woe to you if you help them! I'll be watching you closely. - Goodbye, Mrs Waters. - Goodbye. And now I should get a nice smooch. For the engagement. I don't hand out smooches. This is no engagement. Ok, as you wish. On Saturday afternoon at the dance I'm telling everyone. The whole village. Then I'll take a smooch and you won't get out of it anymore. And you know what, Mr Waters. I'll take the horses now so they get used to me. He drinks a lot. And gambles. - Don't like it. - Nobody asked you! Mind your business! I will not! I'm not giving my only child to such a brute! What'd you say? One more word and out you go. I should've gone a long time ago when I was still a little healthy. - You should've! - I'll have new horseshoes made for them. Don't worry, Mr Waters. My place for them will be like heaven. What are you staring at? Give them to me. Damn! Mr Waters, please don't give her to him. We all know what kind of person he is. What do you care? Back to work and don't butt into issues not concerning you. - There is your place, in the stable. - I really love Hanicka. I'd give my life for her. Give her to me and I'll work here until I die. - I'd do anything for her. - Anything for her. And I'll pave the way for you, right? Yea, settle down on such a farm. I believe it. You'd like that, right? I don't want your farm. Or anything. Just give me Hanicka and we'll honor and love you. Ok, fine. You can have her. When you bring me as many gold pieces as Hoofington has. And one more. Then come ask for her. But you'd have to bring the treasure from the Black Forest. Jan! I heard everything. My father won't give me to you. He only thinks about money. I'd rather run away, but I can't leave my sick mother here by herself. Hanicka. Don't cry. I won't give you up. Even if I have to unite with the whole of Hell. Kuba!! The gate! Kuba! Kuba! Stop! Stop, stop! Stop! Dammit! Dammit! What are you doing loitering about, tramps! Go to Hell! - We were just there. - And they kicked us out too. - Beggars forcing their way in. - Husband, are you crazy? Now in summer every free hand and we need workers. In the forest, after storms to cut the fallen trees and bring them back. You said so yourself. Ok, but under one condition. 1 meal a day and you'll sleep in the stable with Jan. - Of course. 1 meal. - That's more than enough. - Come on, young fellas. Welcome. - So why are you standing there? Hurry! There are axes and saws under the shed. Cut wood in the forest, Chop it, go! Vagrants, they'll steal something again. The little duckling near the fig Near the fig There it found three fishies All were this big All were this big All were as big as I am When I'm standing on a black ram All were this big All were this big... Kind man, tell me where I can find a well nearby with good water. I'm exhausted after the long journey and extremely hot. Yes, yes, yes Your Highness, a well, it's very close. Hana, quick, bring water from the well. Her Highness is thirsty. Hurry. - Your Highness... - Bring water for my horse too. Yes, of course, of course. Jan! Quick, the horses, water. Hurry! Move it! - You have beautiful and healthy children. He's just a farm hand. I just have the girl. - God did not bless me with more. - A farm hand, you say? I'm looking for just such a capable young man in my services. - Him? That good-for-nothing? - Either way, how much do you want for him? - Well... how much, I... - I'll give you a 100 gold pieces. Enough? A gold pieces you say. I'd give him to you for free even, but you know, where can I now find another such capable worker, now at harvest? 200 gold pieces? 200 gold pieces. Well, I don't know. I still just don't know. Three hundred gold pieces. - Here you are. - Your Highness. - You are Hanicka, right? - Yes, My Lady. - And you are? - Jan. I like you. I'm actually looking for such a capable farm worker to enter my services. - Thanks for the offer, but I'll stay here. - The princess wants you, so you're going! The princess surely forgives, but I'm not going anywhere. I promised him 300 gold pieces. I'll give it to you too. You'd have it nice. You'll only take care of the parrots and keep me company. - But I'm not for sale. - Look at that. And may I know what keeps you here? You're going, or else! Hana isn't for you. I already spelled that out for you yesterday. I've betrothed her to Hoofington. He's a rich farmer from here. On Saturday they'll be engaged and this beggar will go back to where he came from! So you're almost a bride? I'm not, My Lady. Not even if I give you a beautiful wedding dress and a chest full of jewels and gold? You won't even marry Hoofington after this? No! Jan's my everything. I wouldn't leave him for all the treasure in the world. - Quiet, or... one more word! - So you're not going? No, I'm not! This is outrageous! A farm hand defies nobility! For a girl who isn't even his! And never will be, Your Highness. Never! Too bad. You just lost 300 gold pieces! You won't bother me for much longer! 300 gold pieces! My God! 300 gold pieces! - Wait, - Who is it? Young man, bring me a bit of fresh water. I'm exhausted after a long journey. Of course. Welcome, Your Majesty. Your Majesty. It's a beautiful house you have. Nice design. You surely aren't suffering. I'm the richest farmer in the village. Well, forget about the village. Far and wide you won't find one of equal wealth. - Hoofington, Alois... Alois Hoofington. - Where's your wife? - Call her so I can greet her. - don't have one, Your Majesty. Why not? - Really? - Really! Such a young man and still single? Yes, I take care of the farm and it's more a priority for me than a... There's no rush. There's lots of time. You're a good steward. You have my admiration. That's why I'd like to ask you for one favor. Yes? Come tomorrow to my summer castle by the lake in the Black Forest past the gorge. To the Black Forest? But nobody dares go there. Even thieves fear it there. I thought you were a braver man. Too bad. Let's go! Little clover with four leaves You to my love it receives Strolling onward with a big grin To where we both are sure to win Little clover with four leaves... Help! Good people, help! Help! Help! - Help, help! - Oh my God... - Help me, please. - My God, what happened to you? Thank you. Jan! Jan! Jan, help! Don't get up, sir. Don't move around much. Where am I? - What happened? - I found you in the forest. You were hurt. Hurt? Yes, they attacked me. In the gorge in the forest, at this really strange rock. That's the Black Rock. How'd you end up there for goodness sake? Everyone stays 100 paces away from there. They even took my horse. I don't even know how I got to the water. Have a drink, please. It's got 9 herbs. It'll give you strength. Thank you for saving me and taking care of me. - I won't be bothering you all any longer. - Oh, please rest, My Lord, until evening. - Our Hanicka will look after you. - Hanicka... Won't you, Hanicka? You have magic hands and a golden heart. Oh, well, everyone would've done it. Not true, Hanicka. You are a rare breed in this world. Don't be angry. I must be going. No, no, no, it's alright. I'm all better. It was your miraculous tea. But I don't want to abuse your kind grace. - I'll have him hitched up, My Lord. - No, thank you, but I can manage it. Thanks even to you, my lady. And you too, kind Hanicka. - You could stay until morning, My Lord. - Thanks for the mare. I'll return it soon. - I promise. -Your Highness. - No, thank you. What are you doing? Get back to the field. You've got work there till evening. And Hana, to the geese, hurry! What? You're already back? - Wood's been chopped, made nice piles. - And these twigs are for your wife. Alright, good. So, stack the wood under the shed and back to the forest! And bring wood, wood, bring it back, until nightfall. And move it! - So, what have you got? - Aspics, bread, an apple-cinnamon dessert. - I want meat. -So rabbit. - Or the blood sausage. - Want that. - Hoofington... - So what about the ponds? - Hold it, that was never part of the deal! - Forget about it. - What are you going to do with them? They'll stay in the family either way! Who else would you be saving them for if you only have one daughter? You're right, Hoofington? Who else? So, you know what? Write my ponds into the contract. Barman, bring a quill and ink bottle. Yea, both of them. But under one condition. - Yea? - Stop gambling. -Wait a second... Just as I said. The cards are over. After the wedding... over. Done! - That's what I say, no if, ands, or buts! - Alright, Mr Waters. - After the wedding, the cards to the oven. - Add that. And the two ponds too. What can I do. Barman, be our witness and sign it here! Throw cards in the oven... plus two ponds. Your Highness... Your Majesty... I came as you commanded. Commanded? More like wished. But I'm happy you didn't leave me waiting. Your wish is my command, My beautiful Lady. Say the words and I'll jump into the pond. - Why would you jump in there? - To show you... how devoted I am to you. I don't doubt that. Did something happen, My Lady? You look a bit sad. Yes, yesterday something unpleasant happened to me. - On my way here I was humiliated. - Who dared! Some farm hand and his girl. There in the meadows past the village. How dare they? What an outrageous insult. I will punish them. Do you know who I'm talking about? Well, it's not too tough to guess, Your Highness. Jan, who works for the farmer and the farmer's daughter, Hana, the young one. - Tell me what to do and... - No, I don't want to go back there. No, Your Highness. I'll punish their arrogance if you allow. No, I don't want you to hurt them. Even though a little lesson for their defiance would do them good. It's as good as done, My Lady. I'll take care of it. If I'm satisfied, your action will not go unnoticed. I will shower you with riches. Our Marjanka is already dancing. Look. Come on. Hanicka, come dance with us. Here you go. - Hello. - Hello. -Hi. Hanicka, would you care for a dance? - The nerve you have, you...! - Please, let him be, sir. I'm her betrothed. Nobody's gonna take her away from me anymore, are they? Go ahead. Go dance with your farm hand. Wait and I'll tell you How that boy to me flew Wait and I'll tell you Want he did me There in the rose garden That kiss, a pardon Wait and I'll tell you Want he did me So everyone knows, I'm announcing it to you that Hanicka here is now my betrothed and on St. Marketa Day, she'll be my wife. Now my engagement smooch since I can't dance. She's shy! No wonder. She's never given smooches in front of so many people. But she'll have to get used to it. Hana! Get back here! Do you hear? Well, well, well, vagrant. I'd rather die than become his wife. Mom, tell me something! Jan! Don't let your life be destroyed like he destroyed mine. I too loved a boy like Jan but my parents married me against my will to this monster just for money. How I suffered. The nights I spent crying. And I was much younger than you Hanicka. You know what, I'll give you a few gold pieces for the way and run away together. Mom, I could never leave you here alone by yourself. He would torture you. Mrs Waters, I admit I cannot imagine life without Hanicka. I swear on all that's holy I won't leave her. To do all I can to stop the wedding. If it's not Hoofington, it'll be someone else. I'll give her a piece of my mind at home. Disgrace us in front of everyone. And he is messing with her head. I'll fire him after the harvest and everything will be alright. That won't help. He'll always be here somewhere around. Best would be if he were no long in this world. At all. Yea, get rid of him. Once and for all. Hana will then calm down and it'll be alright. You're right. Ok, but how? - Might know of something. - Yeah? An orphan. Nobody will be locking for him. That was a good dance. - No, no, come on. - I just wanted to watch. What have you got? I win! I win again, Mr Waters... And you still want me to quit gambling. Yea, but not until after the wedding. Now you can play still. Show me. Alright, one more round. We haven't got anything to play with. - We've lost everything. - And this was left for our tab. Leave the tab to me. Sun don't go setting Don't go setting just yet I am quite enjoying... Hello, My Lord. I am quite enjoying The high crests and low troughs No one here can believe With us there's no drop-offs No one here can believe - Good morning, Hanicka. - My Lord... Don't be angry, I didn't mean to scare you. I came to return the horse and thank you for saving my life. But I barely helped you at all. I wrapped your wound. You did, you really took care of me! Look, my hand is almost all healed. - It is, and the wound looked really bad. - Yea, it was your magic hands. And kind smile. I'd like to repay you. Tell me something that would make you happy. Your recovery is my present, sir. I'm glad to hear. You're modest. But, is there anything that would make you happy? - Hardly could you help me, My Lord. - At least I could try though. My father wants to marry me to the farmer Hoofington. - And you don't want that, do you? - He's not a nice person. But there's someone who is nicer. It's the guy who helped me on the horse? Here you are. Help yourself, My Lord. Like home. Surely you're used to better, but we gladly give you the best we have. Thank you. You are nice and kind people. Loving and selfless. And that's why I don't see why you're forcing your daughter Hanicka to marry one she doesn't love. You should, on the contrary, allow her to choose who she wants. What? She's been complaining to you? That's exactly why we love her and want the best for her. So I, uh we chose for her a groom from the wealthiest farm. - He's loved her a long time... - But she doesn't love him as she confided to me a short while ago. Because her head's full of that mongrel out there. But he'll be gone soon and won't mess with our little girl again. The wedding will be in this summer! That's final. Alright then. You don't want someone rich. Your father won't give you to a poor man. What would you say if I wanted to marry you? I'd make you a happy countess and the adornment of my entire dominion. The richest maybe, but not happy, My Lord. Take it as a thank you for saving my life. Or as the present I'd promised you. Forgive her, My Lord. I'll bring her to her senses. Forgive me for daring, please. Were you serious? I'm single. Without ties. I've decided to stop travelling the world and settle down. And I want a nice girl, be her not wealthy or of noble birth. And your Hanicka... Your Hanicka captured my heart the moment I laid eyes on her. My God, Your Grace. What an honor! Who would've thought! A poor girl and such a gentleman. Jindrich Karel Sebastian, Count of Boulderstein, subject to his Imperial Majesty. His Imperial Majesty... Jesus Christ! This is a deposit. For my word. For Hanicka. Gold pieces, gold pieces! Don't tell me you wouldn't know how to get rid of that farm hand. Of course, yes, I understand. - Do you promise? - swear. On my soul! - Don't worry. He's as good as gone. - Alright. And what about her betrothed here? Hoofington? It's too bad for him. Things happen, don't they? Life goes on. A count is a count. It's agreed, Your Grace. Don't you know how to greet a gentleman, huh? - Who are these people? - I don't know, Your Grace. I hired them to help in the forest. When they finish with the wood, they're gone! And just so you believe me, next time I'll bring a wedding contract. My God. Hanicka, what happened? Tell me. Jan, our luck has run out for good. The man we helped has asked for my hand. He is a count. What are we going to do? - I don't know. Run away. Your mother can... - But I can't leave my mother by herself. My father's wrath may put her in a grave. Hanicka, do you want to go with us? There are strawberries in the field! - And mushrooms in the birches! - Please, I have to... Mr Waters sold her to some count. For a mound of gold pieces. I just can't see why these yellow metal strips have such control over a person. The biggest. Everything in this world is measured either through gold or money. What if you just found some of these yellow metal strips and there you go? - And there you go. - But where? Even though it's said that long ago here in the Black Forest... No, I'll never let you go there. Nobody's ever come back from there, Jan! - Oh well, what to do. - We meant well. But if those two have already shaken on it, don't wait here too long, I'd guess. It's starting to get all tangled up. Who is this other guy? I don't know, but he's definitely up to something. When I feel sorry for them, I would like to help them a bit. Be quiet. Hell has big ears. Any chatter and we'll be turned into coal. But I really feel sorry for them. Me too. Wood, up, get to work! That's hard work, darnit, - Woe is me... Woe is me! Unlucky me! - Over there, over there! Woe is me! Unlucky me. Look. There it is. Poor, unlucky me... - Now we've got you! - Sinful soul. You're the one that escaped from us in Hell, aren't you? - From you? - Because of you we were sent to the world. - Both of us. -Yea. - Because of me? Oh, how about this? - Now you recognize us? - Huh? -Yea, now I do. - You've just made it so much better. - You didn't get very far. I did. I got to heaven, but at the gates they turned me away. Until I atone for what I did during my life on Earth. So do it and don't sit here like a goober. You stashed away a mound of gold that didn't belong to you, right? - Did, I did. - You stole from and ripped off people, hm? I did both. Then you got a stroke from greed and weren't even able to enjoy it. Exactly, yes. I had a stroke, a stroke. Now I have to find some honest, decent person to take and give my gold to the poor. And leave just enough to live modestly. They told me that up at the Pearly Gates. Only then will I be liberated. - We might know of someone. - Yea, we might. A kind, and too decent. Tell me. Help me, my beautiful devils, please! It ran away! A fox! I was going to meet Mr Waters when I heard Hanicka singing, so I came to have a look and a fox crossed the path and you just now scared it off. My husband went to the village to arrange something. I thought he was at your place. Well, we just missed each other. Fine. I'll go so I don't wait here in vain. Bye. This is what I was thinking, Mr Waters, and it's quite simple, look. Just clear away some leaves, then use the branch as a lever, and that's it. Wow, that's smart thinking, Hoofington. You're too smart for the village. You should be doing business in the city at the magistrate or in an office. I'll make a name for myself. Maybe one day you'll hear of me. That'll be the day. - What did you say? - Your wish is nearly done, My Lady. Jan and Hana by tomorrow evening will no longer be among the living, -as your wished. - didn't wish it That's what you wanted. They don't have to die right away. ltd be enough for something, say, unpleasant to occur, - So they learn their lesson. - All or nothing, Your Grace. Don't worry. - And isn't Hana your bride-to-be? - She is! She is! That doesn't matter. For you I'd leave my father, brother, even my bride-to-be. Excellent! Your determination and bravery please me. I have real knightly valor in my line. I would wish to have a similar type of man of action by my side. To protect, advise, and be a nice friend of mine. Your Grace... I... Are you serious? You don't believe me? Come tomorrow and we'll sign a contract stating we'll stay together forever. My God. I'm gonna have to pinch myself to see if I'm not dreaming, Your Grace. - Happy card! Happy day! - Betka! -Yes, yes. I'm coming. What the...? What the... what's this? - No good. - Hey, shut it and bring me a drink. - Hey, one time you, another me. - It's just a game, isn't it? This can't be! Again! - He'll end up bad today. - I agree. It's just not possible. Dammit! We got lucky again. I'll get the money back. Count on it! - What are you doing wandering about? - I'm watering the garden, Father. Garden, some flowers, for nothing! The little duckling near the fig Near the fig There it found three fishies All were this big All were this big All were as big as I am When I'm standing on a black ram Seventh loss! The whole of Hell is conspiring against me! Hoofington, get a hold of yourself. You're gonna lose absolutely everything! - Don't worry! Let's keep playing! - He hasn't got anything! He's lost it all. Hoofington, don't be stupid. You're completely broke! - Do you have anything else to play with? - He doesn't because he's lost his coat, field, forest, meadows, both ponds, horses and now his farm lock, stock and barrel. Unlucky in cards, lucky in love, isn't that right, Hoofington? - Yea, I'd say so. - True. He's got a beautiful bride-to-be. - The prettiest in all the land. - But when she finds out he's lost it all, -she'll leave him, - So there'll be another. Hoofington here is a good-looking man. There'll be another. So now... I'm betting Hanicka! Hoofington, what are you saying. Get a hold of yourself! As I said! Write it down. I'm betting my bride-to-be. And on one card! Here we go! - This is horrible! -Damn! - You've lost Hanicka! A bride-to-be lost, hmph, take her! - No! - You've even lost that. And who's gonna pay your tab, huh? He lost his coat, horses, farm, and in the end even your Hanicka. - What! Hoofington lost my Hanicka? - Yea. And who won her? What's wrong? Nothing to do? You, come here! Hurry! Take this to the Black Forest. There at the gorge Jakub, the stable boy for Farmer Pazdera from Zbudov will be waiting for you. Why there? Everyone avoids that place. You saw the count. He was nearly killed there. It's daylight. Plus, you're a strong guy who can't be smacked around so easily. Or are you? - Mr Waters? -What? - If you've heard Hoofington lost Hanicka in a card game yesterday? Along with his whole farm. Why do you care? Even if so Hana now has another betrothed. Let me tell you something, guys. After the gorge, I'll have a look at the castle. - Such a nice boy. - And we can't help him. Too bad. Here you go. Take it. Come on. Come on. - Yes? - May I? Jakub! Jakub? Jakub, where are you? - Here. - Where? - Here in the back. - Where? I can't see you anywhere. Come on. Budge. Jakub! Yea. You have no idea how happy that makes me. He's a filthy guy, that Hoofington. Ripe for hell a long time coming. He left you a present here. - A present? - A goodbye present. That's how he wanted to get rid of you. But he lost me in a card game. Why this? Because he promised some princess he's in love with. He screamed it outside the pub. So now go. I'll have a chat with this miscreant here. Jan? Here! - Over here my friend! - Hold on! One more second. Great. You're alive! Ugh, that was close. What was it? It was a trap. Set for you. For me? Who'd try to kill me, a poor farm hand? That's not hard to guess. You're getting in someone's way. - Hoofington. - And? -Mr Waters. They may have wanted to get rid of you so Hanicka would forget about you. - But I heard someone calling. - It wasn't Jakub. So nobody was here waiting for me? That's wicked. That's it. Nobody's getting Hanicka. Not Hoofington, not the count! This is the best thing that could've happened my sweet girl. You've got rid of that jerk and brute. I know, Mother, but there's still the count. - At least he's nice and really loves you. - But I don't love him. Wrong. Wrong way. Don't be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. - Who are you? - The sinful soul of the greedy owner of this castle. I ripped people off, stole, -hoarded money. - And how do you know that I want... - What else would you be doing here? - True. People have already looked here. The treasure is somewhere else. - How can you know? -I didn't dig anything there. I can't help you, I'm not here. My gold pieces. My beautiful gold. Goodness. I stole all of it, the sinful soul, for the late Vilhelmina. - And what do you want to do with it? - What else. I'll give it to those just as poor as I. I'll keep just enough to get Hanicka. If you do what you say, you'll free me from Hell. I promise. I'm sorry, Your Highness, for not having time to clean myself up, but I hurried straight away to joyfully say that Jan and Hana have been punished. - Forever. - What? Both of them? How'd you do it? Well, it wasn't easy, Your Highness, I must admit. But my ingenuity and desire for your recognition -gave me the needed strength so... - So? So they no longer get in your way or mine. I knew I had found the one I was looking for. It's written here what I promised. That we'll be together forever. Did you change your mind? - Will you sign it? - With my own blood! -Really? - But it'll hurt. - It won't, My Lady. - Still can't believe that you are mine! Forever! Excellent job, Ashen-face. I admit you caught a big sinner! - I did, Your Highness. - Now, it's your turn Coalhead. But be careful. Tonight will end the rotation of the moon. - I'm working on it, Your Hellish Highness. - Yes. -And then there is our bet. Prove that love is more powerful than gold. - Welcome, sinful soul. - Yea, yea, sinful. Up there you brought hell to those around you. - No! - Now you'll enjoy your fill here with us. To the furnace with him! No, no! Let me go! I don't want to! Leave me alone. Let me go! - Your Highness! - Hello. Welcome, Your Grace. It's my great honor that you... What about our agreement? You mean the vagrant? If he's not already with the Lord, he will soon be. I put together such a trap he won't get out of. For your information, there behind the... Wonderful, sir. I see you are truly a man of action. The end justifies the means, as our priest says. Here it is all written out. You will receive a great fortune for Hanicka. I think you will be very satisfied. - Wow... a thousand gold pieces! - All you have to do is sign. Sign... We don't have ink. It's all dried up! Completely! That's ok. Just prick your finger. What? What are you doing here? How are you not yet...? Dead, as you had wished? - Dead? - Yes, sir. They set a trap that should've killed me. He with the farmer Hoofington. Get over it and get off my property at once! I never want to see you again! You said if I have as many gold pieces as Hoofington, I can ask for Hanicka's hand. Since Hoofington lost it all in a card game, he doesn't have anything anymore. And the one gold piece more, as you wanted, I have right... ...here! Very nice, boy. No, not like that. I said it when Hoofington had a farm and everything. - That counts! - Fellas, come in! Gold! Where'd you steal it from, you thief! Confess! I didn't. I just listened to you and went searching in the Black Forest. In the Black Forest? I've got these in my chateau. At least a hundred. A hundred and one. No! You promised that when I bring the gold, Hanicka will be mine. Keep you promise, Mr Waters! You scoundrel! How dare you! If you kill Jan, Count, then kill me too! Get away from him, Hana. Did you hear me? Just as I had guessed. Ouch... Matej... ...Waters. - Your Majesty, it was you? - Yes. I wanted to be convinced myself if the two would succeed as you had claimed. - And also if you wouldn't help them. - Have mercy! Please! You should've thought about that earlier. Now it's too late! - Yea, yea, late. - No no no... help! You've completed your task excellently. I admit that I have lost the bet with you. - You have made me very happy. - My children... As 2 reward you will be promoted and you can have one wish. Can we go back to the farm one more time? Your Highness. Don't be afraid. We came to thank you for your love and trust of one in another. And since you resisted the temptation of money and power. Don't be afraid. It's us. See! And thanks to you for persevering in your love, we've won a bet with His Majesty -and we can finally return home. - To Hell. But Mr Waters and Hoofington we'll not be returning. - Ever. - Thank God. Oh, and... And here, the note for Hoofington's farm. We won it in the card game. That was us, too. But we even won Hanicka but we'll... happily leave her to you, Jan, just like everything you have here. My brothers, how can we ever thank you? And if you ever need anything, just tap on this card here -and we'll be right here. - And happily. - Have a good life. - Everyone! English subtitles by FILMPRINT
