Tribute to my father Waheed Hamed whom I’m inheriting his words… Marawan Hamed” “If England’s empire means ruling the world as Denshawai has been ruled, then there can be no more sacred and urgent political duty on earth than the disruption, defeat, and suppression of the Empire” The renowned British playwright George Bernard Shaw (1906)” “The movie is inspired by true events, yet can’t be considered a historical text” “Denshawai village, June 13, 1906” Good! Come on! God punish you! -Super! -Nathan, can you see that? Nathan! -Got it! -May God punish you! May God punish you all! -Come on! -Come on! No… no… What’re you shooting pigeons, man?

Back off! Come on, back off! Pull out! -Come on -Back off! That day was a turning point in Ahmed Abdel-Hay Kira’s life after the British killed his mother and detained his father and no one was left for him except his grandma The tribunal started and lasted for 4 days Villagers were accused of burning the crops, killing the man who died of sunstroke Four of them were sentenced to death, on top of them was Abdel-Hayy Kira They set the gallows on his land and forced the villagers to attend it so that no one would ever think of defying the British again “Real scenes of Denshawai massacre” “The execution arena and to the left, a man who fainted before being whipped” Denshawai massacre exposed England in front of the world and forced Lord Cromer, the Consul-General, to resign I’ve always been told that Egyptians don’t generally show great amount of gratitude On his last day in Egypt, he described us as “uncultured” Towards the aids and privileges that were questionably compelled upon them I don’t know what their feelings are in this respect But I refuse to believe that the Egyptians in all cases, don’t recognize that the western civilization acting mainly during the last 25 years Through the instrumentality of England which raised them from the slum of this pond in which their lot was to be cast which opened to them the road to prosperity I believe it’s a fact That the children of the blind are able to see On this day, an Egyptian lawyer called Saad Zaghloul heard this humiliation After 13 years, he told the British: “Enough occupation, go back to your country” And the answer was… Refusal “Kira and El-Jinn” “March 8, 1919… The British camp downtown” Simson!

He’s a mean guy, he wanted to take my automobile He also insulted you, so I hit him on the face People in the neighbourhood say you sell dope in the British camp What dope are you talking about, father? It’s the British who bring drugs to Egypt Saad Pasha is struggling for independence while my son is serving the British Pa, we’re in 1919 The British defeated Orabi, he Turks, the Germans and the Austrians So, they’re the masters of the world If it hadn’t been for the British, we would’ve been on the rocks Plus, nothing ventured, nothing gained Come on, what’s with you, old Shehata?

You haven’t changed, Kira! Not exactly I have a small group that is spreading the exile news everywhere to Upper Egypt The news will spread all over Egypt in a few hours People will take to the streets. There’ll be bloodshed. The British will go mad The Resistance will put pressure on the British and expose them But I’ve quit working with the Resistance for a long time, Hassan Yeah, I can tell that from the rifle you pointed at me I have to go to the hospital early. So I need to sleep. See you later Kira Tomorrow March 9, 1919, there’ll be new rules for the game with the British Saad Pasha’s exile will either be a beginning or an end We should join hands like an army Until victory is achieved I’ll tell you everything happening inside the palace And I’ll provide you with info that you can never imagine to obtain And also with monetary aids and facilities What matters is to appear as if we don’t know each other “Executing the Sentence against Denshawai Offenders” My God!

Thank you, sir Mr Adam Write this down There were 5 perpetrators, possibly 6 The first His shoeprint Looks like an Egyptian constable shoe The second fellow was driving the milk truck With a machine gun in the back. That’s number three The fourth man was shot And they took his body with them The fifth man Was their guard His job was to cover their escape route The sixth man That man was the closest in proximity to Douglas when the gate opened This is the man’s sword But why did he use a sword when they had all those weapons Check the origin of the sword in the Egyptian records Find out who it belongs to On your knees! -On your knees! -Order! You took part in Colonel Douglas assassination Assassination! Colonel Douglas is dead?! Good grief! When? It’s useless to deny it.

No one could break a sugarcane as I did I’m Eleazer’s sister How about Bostina, Shenouda’s sister? Your beloved? Do you still want to marry her? What’s wrong, brother?

They threw us in Sinai and forced us do menial work We dug wells, railways… and barracks for the British One day, the Turks were here They ordered us to carry weapons Some of us refused to take sides with the British against the Turkish Those who refused were ordered to stand in line -And they told me to man up -Shoot Shoot!

Just a nightmare -What did you dream of? -I can’t remember I’ll tell you something, but please don’t get angry One of Fahmy’s schoolmates told him: “Your father is the British’s Pet” How did you answer Fahmy? I told him “At least he doesn’t sell hats to the foreigners like the boy’s dad” “Your dad is a doctor who treats poor, sick people and they pray for him” And I also told him… That the British fear you -Fahmy -What’s worse than fighting the British is having to spend time away from his son This is Arabi El-Tormay, the thug of the neighbourhood or the “fetewwa” Good morning, king! What an extraordinary voice! How did you come by it? An old knife wound Millimetres away from the oesophagus. You’re a lucky champ And what is this? A fresh wound Who reckless guy dares strike the thug? Where may I find him? Yeah… El-Jinn! -Jinn! -What’s it, my lucky charm?

What’s with you, Hima? Enough getting on the booze! You’ve drunk like a fish Listen, there’s no problem if you tell him about Alexandra and the beer but not about your struggle against the British until they leave the country I wish I could be as fearless as you, Kira Pretend that you fear nothing until you and your enemy believe it Fear won’t stop death The British paid me a visit Am I a dead meat?

Zeinab! “I seek refuge from the accursed Satan. In the name of Allah” Zeinab’s death was an unexpected blow to Kira She died while believing that Ahmed was a servant to the British She died and left Fahmy who was only 12 years old Kira felt afraid for the first time in his life when he imagined that Fahmy could lose his father as he lost his mother When Kira gets upset, he shuts himself away From the whole world “Meet El-Qorashy village- Daqahleya governorate” “100 peasants from the village were killed by air-to-ground missile” -Allah -Call for Him -Allah -Call for Him -Allah -Mentioning Him -Allah -Heals the hearts -Allah -Mentioning Him -Allah -Praise him -Allah -Praise the Prophet -Allah -O Allah -Allah -Even the flowers -Allah -They have thorns -Allah -Everything belongs to him -Allah -Everything is created by Him -Allah -I’m a helpless human -Allah -I beg You -Allah -I’m a helpless human -Allah -I beg You -Allah -To have mercy on me -Allah -To protect me from Hellfire -Allah -O Allah -Allah -Call for Him -Allah -Mention Him You know, Kira?

Someone else should take over and bear the responsibility What does this mean? I have an orphan child who I want to look after, Jinn It’s enough that his mom died while asking me to stop serving the British She died without knowing who she was living with I spent my whole life putting on an act, as if I was a professional actor -And then I caused her death -Have faith in God What could you’ve done? It’s her fate At least I would’ve been by her side, I could’ve saved her -This doesn’t sound like Ahmed Kira -Ahmed Kira is torn to pieces For years, I’ve been working to no avail So many people died in front of me They visit me every day in my dreams, especially my father I buried him with the rope stuck around his neck, he was left hanged for 2 hours I don’t want Fahmy to go through what I’ve been through At least, your father died while feeling pleased with you Until this moment, I don’t have the gut to visit my father’s grave I just can’t I wish he’d come and see what I’m doing now I’ll go on, Kira I’ll go on even if you quit, it’s you who encouraged me You made feel I had no value among the British But would be of a great value among you even if I died It’s better for Fahmy to be an orphan than grow up in humiliation By the way, the British killed 100 persons in Meet El-Qorashi village yesterday It’s said that they attacked them by aircrafts while they were in the fields If we were insects, they wouldn’t kill us this way! Bye, Kira Did you like the radio? -Do you know what this thing is called? -No -It’s pianola -What is “pianola”? The man keeps rotating the wheel until it makes music And people watch him and get amused. I’ve got an idea, Fahmy What if I put you inside the pianola and rotate you? -I’ll be minced into pieces -You! Stop there! -Who are you? -Dr Ahmed Kira Doctor? Your son? A beautiful boy Tell me, brave one Do you know how to do the military salute to a British officer? Please, sir, he’s just a boy Then teach him Fahmy, I want you to raise your hands with your fingers closed to one another -And look at him -You told me not to talk to the British You’re right, Fahmy, but only this time Now you perform the military salute -“Didn’t I tell you before…” -“After 6 months” “That numbers outdo bravery?” You’ve seen for yourself it’s for real not imagination -Hold your cat tight, Ishak -Shame on you, Halbawy You fear cats! -Hello. Hi, Jinn -Hello, how’re you, pal? -Fine… Come on, man -Can’t believe you’re scared of cats Want a cig? OK, take the whole pack -Who you expected it to be? Ishak -Kira! Welcome back Kira! Kira! I missed you, man. Welcome back How’re you, Dawlat? How’re you, Halbawy? -I was waiting for Kira -How’re you doing, Jinn? You were eating salted fish without me?! The Resistance isn’t the same We can’t without you Don’t devour it, boy I can’t help it, it’s yummy -Alright -Cheers “Didn’t I tell you before…” “that numbers outdo bravery?” You’ve seen for yourself it’s for real not imagination “what used to spoil our lives” “is that man would turn out to be another one” “What do they have to do with our religion?” “They got into our country and drove a wedge among us” “but we uncovered his scheme and grew more united” “Although life smiled at them and they’re richer and luckier” “we look like a running river” “while they look like a dirty drain” “When you live in the Nile Valley, you don’t get enough water” “while the foreigners get it all” “I hope you’ll have better luck. We don’t have money or houses” “we even borrow the clothes we put on” “What a disgusting life!” “When will the Egyptian people’s money be invested in it?” “You invest the money and we do the effort” “Two heads are better than one” Welcome back, Kira -How’s the judge’s daughter? -Haven’t met her since the last operation It’s enough that she led us to Kieve Come on, man, how could you waste a source like the judge’s daughter? Is the judge’s daughter pretty? She’s pretty, Jinn, but she’s just a source -It’s a mere charade -A charade! I’m thinking of a charade that’s much better than this one And that’s how we’ll celebrate your return And at the same time, I’ll be visiting the camp I used to work at You must be crazy! It’s like a fortress Wait, Halbawy, let him continue. Go on, Jinn I have devilish schemes and I know every inch of that camp The meat automobile goes there every day at 10 pm We’ll get in it and sneak inside it We’ll plant explosives in the biggest weapon cache in the capital and we’ll go out unnoticed How many of us will die in this operation, Mr Smart? -It’s a good chance, Halbawy -It’s a suicidal operation Excuse me, I want to leave before the patrols start -Bye -Bye Take care, Dawlat Think about it, Kira Goodbye Hey, queen! Isn’t it high time we get close to each other? Time flies The 37-year British occupation could last for many more decades Seems you’ve got my point when I told you I’m a Coptic Upper Egyptian A girl is buried in the mountain if she’s on a relationship with an urban man What should I do with you? I don’t know how to get to you Why haven’t you got married until now? I was deeply in love with a girl But she knew an Austrian man and eloped with him So I decided to live like a king and buy an automobile Really? Is that why you became a playboy, a crook and an addict? I’m neither a playboy, a crook nor an addict I’m healthy and as fit as a fiddle Just look at me. Jinn is in the clear Do you still miss her? I’ve forgotten her since I saw you and heard your tough Upper Egyptian words and felt your strong handshake Your name is Abdel-Qader, isn’t it? The best time I heard it If you really love me, quit wine and drugs Dawlat! Don’t let our lives be wasted You have big dreams, Jinn By the way,… El-Jinn is not just in good health El-Jinn works out miracles Come on, cabbie Alright, move on You go Is anybody there? Is anybody there? -Hurry up, Ibrahim -Alright, alright Back off Ibrahim! OK, coming! Hurry up, Ibrahim! Come on! Come on, Ibrahim Kira Come on, Ibrahim Ibrahim! Sir -Yes, sir -I’m expecting a call from the king shortly He wants to know what happened in the camp With respect, sir, this is a new level of resistance A big shift in strategy Tell the King I’ll have the perpetrators in a matter of days And it’s a promise Love is dangerous here Dawlat is not meant for you, Jinn Because simply you won’t be able to protect her in time of danger “Al Lataef Al-Mossawarah “The Body of the Camp’s Criminal” Without any farewell, Ibrahim was gone A new vendetta with the British And a sign that what’s coming is more difficult that even What? Who? -Good morning, dear Fahmy -Thank you, Makhali -Enjoy -See how much he loves you? -A cup of tea. Thanks -Sure How’re you, Emily? I beg your pardon Have we met before? After the last time I saw you, I was sent to Asyuit the very next day Because of the Spanish influenza For 9 whole months Your son? You never said you were married Widower Fahmy’s mother, God rest her soul, died in 1918 Out of Spanish influenza Would you like to join us? Hello, Fahmy No, dear, don’t do that with her This is not the right salute, Fahmy Can we be friends? -She smells of vanilla -Hush What’s got into you, Fahmy? You’re not yourself Fahmy has fallen in love with you Me too Would you come watch the new Charlie Chaplin movie with me? Bye Perhaps Yeah, great vanilla smell -Get out -Yes, sir? We found these footprints behind the eastern camp And this is a matching shoe which we recovered from your house We also found shell casings and bullets inside the camp covered in your fingerprints Your own fingerprints, Mr Halbawi Verified by our records Since your one and only previous arrest, You’ve somehow escaped all the criminal charges But now… Finally, you seem you singed your own death warrant Congratulations But… I have a better offer Hand me the resistance and whoever financing them And in exchange, I’ll give you a reward of 10 thousand pounds As well as a monthly salary of 30 pounds for life, and… And a pardon for your crimes And I’ll reinstall you in the government What do you say? Go back to your country, foreigner Seems I haven’t made myself clear You’ll tell me their names Or by God, you’ll get out of here to the execution chamber I was afraid you wouldn’t come It’s Charlie Chaplin after all What brought you at such an ungodly hour? I lost sleep The English patrols are searching the buildings near the girls’ dorm You lost sleep or you came to mess with the jinn? My God! I saw Mr Kira upstairs with a foreign woman This is the best proof that the Crescent is united with the Cross -Mr Kira never falls in the abyss -“Abyss” Is love an abyss? It’s a blessing Whoever turns it down, lives sadly ever after Why have you been called “Jinn”? When I was little, I was naughty and hyperactive I was an orphan and all women in the neighbourhood were sympathetic to me One of my neighbours was a scary chicken One day, I decided to pull a prank on her I put on a black gown and waited for her in the dark She was coming downstairs slowly I waited for her in ambush, and when she was close, I popped out and shouted “I’m the jinn!” When she saw me, she passed out and broke her leg Since then, the neighbourhood has been calling me the Jinn And you call me “nutty”? I see you quitted drinking, eh? For your sake. I quitted just for your sake I consider every day I spend here as my last day The only thing that makes me feel I’m still alive is you Miss Dawlat,… Would you dance with me? Enough -Ouch, you stepped on my foot -I’m sorry Enough, Jinn. Enough We’ll kill 100 of them… Every day you spend in prison, they’ll pay for it Hang in there, Halbawy” You’re getting old, Halbawy Are you willing to sacrifice your remaining years to a lost goal? Do you seriously believe that a battle of rebels can change anything? The power of the British Empire is unsurmountable I may need to repeat my offer Once more Give me the names of the resistance and whoever financing them And in return, I’ll give you a reward of 10 thousand pounds and a monthly salary of 30 pounds for life a full pardon of all your crimes And you’ll be reinstated in the government If I’m set free, they’ll know I betrayed them He’s afraid of letting him out now; his friends will know he betrayed them That’s precisely why we won’t let you out right away If you agree to our offer… our very generous offer you’ll first be handed a prison sentence In the eyes of your friends, you’ll be the hero you’ve always wanted to be And in a short while, you’ll be pardoned and released And you’ll return to your life… a rich man Ahmed Abdel-Hay Kira Abdel-Qader Shehata El-Jinn I wish I didn’t have to go What happened tonight? Was it… Real Remember I’m rebellious Good night, Dr Kira Were you with someone just now? A friend We watched a film at Café Riche Does your friend have a name? What does he do? He’s an Egyptian friend, papa. Dr Ahmed Kira -Am I on trial? -Oh, Emily Don’t forget your status as a respectable British lady -Good evening -Good evening, sir. Welcome Would you care for a drink, sir? -Mr Adam -Thank you, sir One whiskey neat A charming place. Yours? Yeah, I bought it from its previous owner, a French gentleman -Your drink, sir -Thank you Sayed Darwish The composer of the political song -Yeah, “Rise to your feet, Egyptian” -“Rise to your feet, Egyptian” “Rise to your feet, Egyptian Egypt is always calling for you” A rousing melody, isn’t it? I suppose so Tell me, Mr Makhali Are pets allowed in here? How did you know my name, sir? This is Makhali, someone knew about the hideout The weapons This is from the British army We’re in disaster. Halbawy was arrested Ragheb was killed, and the hideout was seized Someone is blowing the whistle on us or there’s a betrayer among us Everyone must tell about their day I’ve been at home since the afternoon I was at home I was at Riche, then Dawlat came Then Ragheb came and fixed the printer Then Makhali lit the light What brought you unexpectedly? A patrol was searching near my place. Couldn’t find anywhere else to go What about you, Kira? You didn’t tell us where you were I was in Riche watching a film with the judge’s daughter Then I drove home and went home Maybe, she pulled your leg to hand us all in Have you fallen for her? I meet the judge’s daughter to take advantage of her -I know what I’m doing -No, you don’t, or else, you wouldn’t have clicked with a British girl and dancing with her above the Resistance hideout Look, you’re the last one to talk about friendship with the British Calm down, Jinn, calm down Ragheb asked to stay with Dawlat What now? Harvey now knows everything about us We must attack them before they attack us We should move out of our places and we shouldn’t go to work from tomorrow We’ll face hard times No one is obliged to go on No! We must avenge those who were killed If Ibrahim was alive, he’d say we must carry on I’ll change My dear God! When did you pop out? -Welcome -Thank you Narges, we want to spend a nice evening with you Oh! Has the ladies’ man picked up his past habit? Oh, no, I’ve mended my ways, thanks to you I’m now a Resistance man. We want to spend a nice evening with a British man An officer called Harvey. Forget about the ladies’ man We’ll travel in a horse carriage, you and me And the parrot behind me You’re so funny Soldier! Don’t you move! Come on Come on The Egyptian, your friend Did he by chance mention to you that he is with the Resistance? And I’m pretty sure He didn’t tell you he is the one who assassinated our dear friend Col. Kieve And he’s imposing himself upon you so that he may kill your own father I don’t believe it Emily Your name is written on the list of Egyptian sympathizers in our Intelligence files As of today, you’re under surveillance And if he dares to contact you, come to me Am I understood? “After one year” You sent with the messenger that it’s urgent A blow that can’t be missed, Kira The Army’s Sirdar, Sir Lee Stack He goes to the Military Ministry every day and stay there till 8 pm before he returns home in Zamalek We don’t have enough men It’s not an easy operation, it needs good planning Time is tight. It must be carried out within two days I have 3 men who are ready to take part It won’t be smooth sailing after the operation There’s an envelope here and a post office address We’ll be in contact through the postman, he works with us See you later “Cairo- November 19, 1924” “Sir Lee Stack, the Sirdar of the Egyptian Army” Run! -Where’s the servants’ door? -To the right They say Egyptian cats have 7 lives British cats have 9 You’ll pay heavy price for that But first Tell me everything you know about the assassination of Major General Stack He wants to know everything about the murder of Maj. Gen. Stack -I know nothing -He says he knows nothing I was just running You’re a reckless criminal -The charges against you are countless -The charges against you are countless Your fingerprints have been traced in the scenes of every operation Your fingerprints are in all operations Not to mention that you failed to kill me A woman came to testify Let her in Get him up Who are you, madam? Dawlat Gabriel Fahmy -May I see your papers? -Your papers? A teacher? -Please sit down -Be seated You’ve come here to testify. What exactly? That man… He’s my lover She says he’s her lover Yes, my lover… for two years -I know him well -She knows him well -He has nothing to do with politics -He has nothing to do with politics -And he never harms anyone -And he doesn’t harm anyone That day… We had a date on the assassination night When the hubbub broke out and people were scattered, we ran and were separated “When the commotion happened, we started running”. They were separated -But he’s not guilty -He is not guilty You arrested him by mistake -You took him by mistake -Mistake! And where does your lover sleep at night? Where does your lover sleep? -He hasn’t been home for years -He hasn’t been home for years At my place He sleeps in her house My house This is quite a bold statement for an Egyptian woman Your angel came to save you at the last breath -Madam, please come with me -Go with him Stand right here I think you two never had the chance to take a photo together, had you? What about taking one now? A souvenir for this little gathering Look at the camera One, two, three… Smile for the picture Thank you, ma’am, follow me “Sirdar Murder Suspect makes important confession” You’ll never imagine, mayor, who came to the DA office today! -Dawlat Fahmy -Confessions of Sir Lee Stack’s murderer Sister of Eleazer. She came to testify for her beloved, that slut What a slut! The whole village is speaking about our family which has been marred in disgrace That black sheep has brought shame to the family Dawlat, a telegraph for you “Come home, your mother is dying” Sir Lee Stack’s murder caused a big blow for the Resistance I used to tell you that men don’t cry But now you’ve grown up and I dare say that men do cry Kira had to travel because his photo was hung in all streets He bid his grandma and son farewell He couldn’t promise when he’d be able to see him again It’s relatively small compared to other tombs in the Valley of the Kings What we found clearly show the speed with which the priests kept the king’s body However, that didn’t stop them from preserving the statues that were touched You’ve finally met your king! My God, you’re brave I’ve come to say goodbye After you humiliated me… And lied to me! And used me as a bait You could’ve killed my father You could’ve killed me We’re in a war Maybe, you’d have done the same This is our fate I love you, Emily You broke my heart Harvey’s men are everywhere They’re waiting for a signal from me if I see you You’d better run What else? Kira is sending you his regards -Hit me -Forgive me Stop! Back off or I’ll kill him Stay back or I’ll kill him! I’ll kill him! Stay back or I’ll kill him! Stay back! Eleazer, what’s wrong with ma? Where’s she? A slut! You shrug off the disgrace, son! With a photo and fake piece of news, they believed El-Jinn told on them Except for Kira, he didn’t believe it They had to contact each other and plan for their escape This is the moment Harvey was waiting for in which he finalized his plot and brought all strings together Death sentence was the ultimate fate for all of them Are you Eleazer Ghabriel Fahmy? Who are you? Are you Dawlat’s brother? You killed Dawlat? You put an end to your disgrace? Your sister died as a chaste woman Your sister was a heroine You killed the most beautiful thing within us “Turkey, Istanbul- After a year” I missed you, El-Jinn I’ve decided to undergo a plastic surgery by a German surgeon to be able to be back The Resistance will never stop, Jinn Tell me how Fahmy is doing He’ll certainly be scared when he sees me You know? This is what hurts me most But I’ve no other option Take care of Fahmy until I’m back Kira! How’re you, Jinn? Welcome back from prison, pal! -When were you released? -A month ago You’re back to drinking? Get to the point, man The British are getting the upper hand We want to remind them that the Resistance never dies Yeah, it never dies… But it’s over After the Sirdar’s blow, there’s no one left except you and I There is… Kira is still there Kira! What’re you saying? Are you crazy? Kira! Kira is wanted and if he gets out of Istanbul, the British will know of it. You’re talking nonsense That’s if he returned as he was Look at the man who came with me Doesn’t he look familiar? Many people look alike. He looks like Kira Great! Listen to this scheme We’ll travel with that guy and scratch his passport photo a little And we’ll have a travel permit issued for a three-person commercial delegation We’ll leave that guy there And we’ll bring Kira out of Istanbul with a new name And how will I leave Egypt, Mr Smart? The British set a reward for whoever turns me in You’ll sail in a fishing boat or 2 or 3 hours in the sea under cover of darkness Then we’ll all meet in Istanbul -What do you think, Jinn? -I’ll ask Kira “Turkey, Istanbul- After one month” I missed you, buddy This is to avenge Dawlat I wish I died instead of her, buddy I missed you, Kira See what I’ve brought for you? Fahmy He’s very clever at school Your grandma, may she live long, is there for him It’s about time you come back home, Kira The British are running wild. There’s no one to stand up to them I’m plotting for a huge operation inside their forces The bullets that will be shot there will make the whole world know that Egypt’s cause is still alive Do you think the Turks will let you do that? This is not where you belong in Your presence in Egypt now is more important than ever before “Photograph of the Passport Holder” There’s a great similarity, but it’s a very big risk, Halbawy I’ve taken care of everything. You’ll be back to Egypt safe and sound And we’ll restore our lost glory Go back to Fahmy, Kira, and we’ll strike back at the British You can undergo the surgery and change your features as you like that you won’t even recognize your own self Think about it, Kira. Where’s the toilet? That way Did you tell Halbawy about the plastic surgery? Of course, not. I haven’t said anything about you since you travelled This is strange! Why did he mention that I’d change my features? -How did Halbawy reach you? -I found him in front of me He kept looking for me after he was released Are you thinking of what I’m thinking of? If he’d ratted on us, why would they have jail him? If he had been released, we’d have suspected him This is the only explanation for what happened to us And the letters were discovered by the British It’s Halbawy, Jinn -Halbawy is the traitor -It’s a trap Where’s my money? You’ll kill them? Cover my back Kira! I ran out of ammo Kira, watch out You, get him out of here! Halbawy is running. Don’t leave him, Jinn The hell with him! I can’t leave you I’ll take of Harvey. Don’t leave him, Jinn I’ve grown old, Jinn Kira! Kira! -You caught Halbawy, didn’t you? -Halbawy… He met His Maker Let’s go Kira! Pull yourself together, friend -Seems you’re the one who will raise Fahmy -No way, I have no time for that You’re the one who will raise him Come on, get up, my friend You must tell Fahmy about his father Get up so that when Fahmy grows up, he won’t find the British in the streets No -He’ll sing? -Yes, Kira, he’ll sing He’ll sing “Haven’t I told you before…” “That numbers outdo bravery" “And here you’ve seen it for real..” Go on, Kira, have you forgotten it? Go on, Kira Will you leave me alone, my friend? Farewell, Kira, farewell Send my regards to my loved ones On that day,… my father didn’t die That was his real birthday Today, citizens, … -a great stage of struggling is over -“Evacuation of British soldiers in 1956” We haven’t carried out those stages alone but many generations have taken that upon themselves Many generations that preceded us tens of years ago They struggled, fought, and fell martyrs but never gave up I’m Fahmy Ahmed Abdel-Hay Kira Did you listen to the speech? The son of the hero who, along with his colleagues, took their lives in their hands and decided to stand up to the biggest army in the world The British army Congratulations, uncle I wish your dad was with us We’ll take to the streets and surround the people” Take me to the street, Fahmy, I want to celebrate with the people “We’ll guide them” “They may fire at us” “It’s likely that any of us may not come home again” “but this is what we agreed upon the first day we joined the Resistance” “The real test is that we all do that for nothing in return” “Our only gain is to live in a free country” “This is the moment we’re waiting for” “They got into our country and drove a wedge between us” “but we uncovered his plot and stuck together”
