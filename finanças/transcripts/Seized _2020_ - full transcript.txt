Finish your homework last night, T? - Taylor? - What? "What?" "What?" I hope you don't talk to your teachers at school like that. I think the correct response you're looking for is, "Excuse me, Dad." Maybe in England, mate, but we're in Mexico. No excuse for bad manners whatever the country you're living in, smart ass. - Hey, I'm talking to you. - Whatever. Oh, yeah, thanks a lot for cooking me that breakfast, Dad! So, Richard, I like what I hear, but how would this benefit my company? Well, do you know what, Tom? I'm actually really glad you asked me that question because our number one priority, - the very top priority, is business value. - Mm-hm. It's about having the resources for planning and implementing a hybrid security architecture that significantly reduces any risk of security breach - with iCloud IT-based platforms, so... - Mm-hm. Do you know what, Tom? I think we're gonna be the company for you. - Sounds great. - Okay? So we're on? - We'll call you soon. - Brilliant stuff, Tom. - Thanks so much. Thank you. - Goodbye. - Hello? - Yes, Taylor's father, please? - Speaking. - I'm sorry to inform you that Taylor was involved in some trouble at school today. Really? Why? What happened? He was in an altercation with two boys. It seems he started the fight. - Oh, he did? - Yes, I'm afraid so. Well, any idea what started it? None of the boys would say how it started, but other students said Taylor was reacting to being teased. Yeah, but even so, he knows better than that. - Does he? - Yeah, of course he does. I'm sure you understand, we can't have this behavior at our school. Well, look, I'll certainly have a chat to him when he gets home, and um... I wonder do you mind giving me the numbers of the parents of the kids that he had the fight with so I can talk to them? I got a phone call from your principal today, buddy. Anything you want to tell me about? Taylor! That's the second time in two weeks! That is.... I'm not happy! Oi! Don't you walk away from me. Turn around! So who was it? Same kids as last time? Yep. That's a pretty good bruise. Who threw the first punch? Because your principal tells me that you did. Is that true? Taylor? I thought we had an agreement. No, you had an agreement. They've been saying things to the other kids about me. They know about Mom. They make jokes about me, call me, "Orphan Boy," crap like that. So what? It doesn't matter. Let them talk. It's not worth getting into a punch-up, is it? Stop walking away from me. I told you before, son, violence solves nothing. It shut them up. It doesn't matter, okay? You can't just go around punching your problems away, all right? It's going to catch up to you in the long run. Look, I'm trying, all right, buddy? I'm trying to raise you the right way, the way your mother would've intended, but... Mom's dead... so why don't you stop trying? Don't be like that. You know, maybe instead of teaching me how to run away from a fight, maybe you could teach me how to stand up for myself. There's better ways of handling things, son. Taylor! Hey, man. Look, look. I don't want trouble. I don't want trouble. So, as you can see, I lured him into a false sense of security whilst getting myself in a nice, strong defensive position. I saw the intent, and then I unloaded with the punches. And I could get in the exact same position. I kick the groin first... And I destroy him and knock him out with that nice big elbow? Or I could start upstairs so he's focused up here... And then I get a nice head kick in. Hey, man. I don't want any trouble. Taylor? - What are you doing? - Homework. Homework? With that noise? I could hear you downstairs, son. I was watching YouTube. Oh, you're watching YouTube, yeah? For homework? "How to hit hard and fast in a street fight." Charming. What are you watching this for? 'Cause the next time one of those kids gives me trouble, I'm going to knock 'em out. Taylor, will you listen to me? I don't want to hear anymore about you getting into trouble at school and hitting kids. I don't care what they're saying to you. It's not worth it. Do you understand? Now get back and finish your real homework because I'm pretty sure that your teacher didn't request a paper on how to smash somebody's face in. I'm almost done. Well, almost isn't finished, is it? So, get it done. I'll be keeping hold of this. - Hello? - Richard. Who's this? Question is, amigo, who are you? What are you talking about? You're a security consultant living in Mexico with a young son, leading a very quiet life. Or so that's the story you've told everyone the last few years. Right... Nero? How do you know that name? I know the truth about you. I know where you've been, what you've done, and who you really are. I don't know what type of game this is, but I ain't playing it. The game has just begun. You will receive a video in 30 seconds. - Be ready. - Taylor?! Taylor! Taylor! Where's my son? Look at your screen, amigo. - Who the hell are you? - I am the one calling the shots. You know the drill. I don't really have to explain it to you, do I? - To someone who is... - You listen to me. If you so much as touch the hair on my kid's head, I swear to Christ! I know. You'll kill us all. And you know what, Nero? That's why I chose you. I don't doubt it for a second, but I need you for a job. What job? What the hell are you talking about? Where's my son?! Hey, you're wasting what little time your son has left alive, huh? You ready to listen? I'm listening. Your son has been imprisoned in a gas chamber. You follow my instructions today, or he will die from carbon monoxide poisoning. You do everything I ask of you today, which will include a lot of killing, amigo, Something you are good at, and by the end of it, your son will be released. - Are you still with me? - Yes, I'm with you. Inside the garage is a package. Andale, rapido! See the vest? Put it on. This vest has a micro camera. Turn it on. Everything you see, I will see, amigo. No games here. Inside the crate is a silver box. Open it. This is your bulletproof SUV. These are your coordinates. Proceed to route. Listen, buddy, until I get to speak to my son I ain't going anywhere. Taylor! Taylor, it's Dad. Can you hear me? Taylor? Dad? Dad! It's all right, son. What happened to your face? Did they hurt you? No, I'm okay. Where are you, son? Listen, can you hear or see anything that might give you an idea of where you are? I don't know where I am. I just woke up here. What's going on, Dad? I don't know, buddy, but... Taylor?! Taylor! Fuck! Shit! He has no idea where he is or how he got there, but the kid put up a hell of a fight. - Tough, just like his padre. - You son of a bitch. Now the rules are simple. Do what I say, huh? Carbon monoxide is nasty stuff. At the end of the day, you completed everything I ask of you, your son will be delivered to a safe location. Well, how do I know you're gonna let him go? It's called trust, and we're going to be working on that today. Trust? It's going to be a pretty fucking long day then, isn't it, mate? When do I get to speak to my son again? After you complete the first mission. Not a moment sooner. I'm here. You see that hotel off to your left? Yeah. There's a meeting going on in the restaurant from the lobby between the Roja Cartel and the Garza Cartel. They're trying to bury the hatchet and come to an agreement, which is a very bad idea, because then they'll control everything west of the T.J. River. Nasty people. So what do you want me to do? I want you to go in there, and kill every person there. Jesus Christ, you cannot be serious. Have I done anything tonight that would give you one modicum of second of thought that I wasn't serious? Look, this is insane, okay? I can't just go in there shooting up the place. What about the innocent bystanders? That's exactly what you're gonna do, and your son's life depends on it. And in this particular place I will play God, and I will tell you this... There are no good people in there. No saints, only sinners. Baddies. Nasties. So, how many nasties are we talking about then? Ten to 12, give or take. Now, that's nothing for the Nero of 15 years ago from what I hear, but the question is... today, do you still have what it takes? You got a dark side to you, haven't you, pal? So, basically, what you're saying is: I need to go in there, kill everyone I lay eyes on, and if I somehow get out of there in one piece, then you're going to let me speak to my son? And that's the only way you're gonna see your son again alive, huh? So, get your ass in there, and play Call of Duty on those motherfuckers. Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. No zippers. I want to make sure I get to watch the show. Yeah, whatever floats your boat, pal. Be back in a minute. Ooh! Bravo, Nero! Bravo, mi amigo. Yeah, whatever, dickhead. Let me speak to my son. Don't you think you should watch your tongue with me, my friend? Now you listen to me, you asshole. I just went on a goddamn killing spree in a restaurant full of heavily armed Mexican bandits. Now cut the bullshit, and let me speak to my son. Hey, hey, hey. You know what? I'm gonna let you pass this time. Just because I know you're under a lot of tension about your kid, but you did a hell of a job in there, my friend, and I don't want you to worry, I'm a man of my word. He'll be right along here in one moment. Yeah, he better be. And I'll tell you another thing, as well. If one of your goons lays another finger on my kid then these murders are gonna come a lot closer to your door. Do you hear me? Hey, why would you say that? We're bonding here. We're creating a trust, and you know what? I'm starting to think, after what you did in that restaurant that I hired the right guy for the job. Hey, look, look. Your son, he's ready. Little tough guy's here. Say, "Hi, Papa." Taylor. You all right? It's Dad. It's cold. I know, son. I know, though you just got to stay calm, okay? I'm coming. I promise. You're sending help? No, I'm going to be doing this one alone, mate. What? How? Look, you just need to trust me, mate, okay? Just trust me. The men who took you... They're making me do something for them, but as soon as it's done I'm gonna come and get you, okay? You just need to hold tight. Who are they? Why are they doing this? Fuck! Put him back on! Hey, hey, Nero. Come on, that's enough with the father-son stuff, okay? Now, listen, don't you worry. I'm gonna get your son a nice peanut butter and jelly sandwich and some warm milk. Meanwhile, you gotta get ready for your next job, okay, Papa? Yeah, you do that. And he likes the crust cut off his sandwiches as well. All right, you prick? Nero, you gotta learn to disagree without being so disagreeable, huh? Your kid's gonna pick up bad habits, okay? Now, I did like the way you kicked that ass. Let's see if you can do some more. Yeah? You like that, did you? Glad to know it's putting some lead in your pencil then, you freak. All right. You get on to your next job, my friend. These are your new coordinates. You were right. He's a killing machine. Yes, and all he needed was a little motivation. Um... I'd like a life coach from hell. Most of the time we clean up after the gringos, don't we? And they sit around, they watch TV. Huh? But tonight, we gonna watch TV while the gringo cleans up for us. I like that. Keep straight. All right, Nero. Let's see what you got. Three minutes, and his limey ass gets torn to shreds. - Whose side are you on? - Yours, boss. All right. Let's see how our gringo likes the nightlife. Stay sharp. Eyes everywhere. Copy that. Nero, the big building to your left. You see it? Yeah, I can see it. The host of our next party is... Machado. He's a bad hombre. He's gonna be the host of the next party that you're about to crash. Trust me when I say this, Nero. You can consider him a really bad hombre. Yeah, I know who Machado is. Good. Good. Then you also know he's got it coming. Yep. Prostitution, racketeering, kidnapping. Oh, and that, uh, bombing in Juárez. Come to think of it, this guy's almost as much of a prick as you are. Touché. Yes, but unlike me, Nero... the world would be a better place without him, okay? So, here's the deal. Our man is inside having a little party. You go to the third floor to the VIP room where he's having some fun, and you kill him. Good luck, and I sure hope 15 years off hasn't made you too rusty, Papa, because your little boy, he's counting on you. The only thing that'll be rusty is the nail I bang into your coffin if anything happens to my son. Damn, I didn't see that shit coming! Nero! Nero! Nero! Nero! Oh! Yeah! Whoo! Hey, Donovan. That's your guy, man. He's the best. I told you. Move! Move! - Machado? - Who the fuck are you? Are you getting this? Sí, perfecto, señor. Now, shoot that pendejo in the head. Mátalo! - Who the fuck is that?! - I don't know. You tell me. How the fuck am I supposed to know? Hey, Nero... carbon monoxide. His voice, you recognize it? Whoever it is, you're a spineless fuck! You couldn't kill me yourself? Oh, I don't like getting my hands dirty taking out the trash, amigo. - Fuck you! - Mátalo! Excellent job, my friend. Sir, we have one more minute before the cops show up. Hey, pretty boy. Get out of the mirror. We gotta go. What you doing? Get out of there! Go! Federales are coming. Vamanos, Papa. Sending new coordinates. - So, is he good? - Looks good. These are your coordinates. Let me speak to my son. You know what, amigo? You deserve it. - Taylor? - Dad, are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay, buddy. What about you? Who are they? Why are they doing this? They just want me to clean up some of their mess. It's my fault though you're in there, and I'm sorry, okay? What do you mean? I used to work for an intelligence agency. Like a spy? Yeah. Kind of. More like a soldier. Special forces. Like one of your video games. Does this have anything to do with Mom dying? Yeah, I'm afraid it does. Dad, tell me what happened. Please, Dad. Hey. Hey, Nero. If anyone deserves to know, it's your boy. Come on. - Shut up! - Who is that?! It's me, Taylor. I'm the man that kidnapped you. Why did he call you Nero? It's a name from the past, a name I don't need anymore. No, Nero. It's a name you better find real quick, huh? Your little boy depends on it, Papa, huh? Tell him the truth. The truth hurts at first, but it'll set you free, huh? Dad, tell me what happened. I want to know. All right, I'll tell you. Somebody betrayed me, okay? Someone... Someone blew my cover to some very bad people. They found out where we lived. They took your mom. I did everything I could to get her back, Taylor, okay? Everything I could. By the time I found her... it was too late. They killed her? Yeah, they killed her. What did you do then? I did what needed to be done. I tracked them down... and when I found them I killed all of them. So, they took me off active duty, they moved us down to Mexico, and we were safe... until now. What do they want? They want me to do to their enemies what I did to mine. All right? I thought I'd left that life behind us, but now it's back. So, I'm going to do what this scumbag wants me to do, and when it's done, I'm going to come and get you, okay? Believe that. Dad, I'm sorry I've been such a jerk. You got nothing to be sorry about, okay, buddy? You're gonna be okay. I'm coming. I love you, Dad. Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt this therapy session, Papa. You got a lot of work ahead of you, and a long drive, my friend. Time to go. The main event will recommence in a few hours. Go get a smoke, get a drink. Mi casa es tu casa. Vamanos. Right, Donovan? Show me respect in mi casa. Si, señor! Si, señor! You can... You can use this to keep warm. I brought you peanut butter... PB&J, that's how you say it. No crusties. Just the way your papa said you like it. Sorry to interrupt your life like this. We needed your papa's cooperation, and that's the way we had to get it. I know you're scared. Everything's gonna be fine. My father's going to kill you. Well, I... I personally hope there's no need for that. After all this, you're gonna go home. Maybe I could, but I've read enough to know that if I see my captor's face, I'm not gonna make it out alive. You're gonna kill me. You're a pretty smart kid, huh? And brave, too. But not everything works out the way it does in books. You might find that out later in life. Later in life? You're gonna have to trust me on that. Donovan, you're not pleased? Well, this is working even better than I thought. Perfecto. And the irony of it is not lost on me, señor. I mean, when you gringos, you send your people to our country you're not sending your best. You're sending your killers, your rapers, your murderers. Look, we had a gringo killer right here in our midst, and all I had to do is activate it. That's your specialty. Take his kid and the switch turns right back on. He does his business, your competition is wiped out, and you set the prices for everything heading north, and your hands stay clean. And with this consolidation of power, we have less violence, less bloodshed in the street, better quality of life. It's good for everyone, and it's good for business. Like I said, brilliant. And now, everyone with interests in this part of the world, including you, has to deal with one man... me. It makes life easy. Now, no cartels killing each other. Not messy. And you still seem worried. Why? If Nero survives this, then he'll kill all of us. We have his son. That's what he cares about. That's correct. That's what I'm worried about. Donovan, why bring this bad energy, huh? Don't jinx it. It's your plan, and everything's going ahead to your plan, right? I mean, we don't even know if he's going to complete his next mission. Hopefully, he does some good damage before this is all over. Yeah, you better hope so. If he survives this, he'll come for us. That's what he's trained to do. It's what he did for us many, many times. You're worried that death's honesty won't fall upon you naturally. Are you scared that Nero's gonna kill you? You bet I am. And you should be, too. I don't trust him. Hm. You shouldn't trust him... Calling him a pendejo is an insult to pendejo everywhere. Hey... soon this war will be over. We'll take our resources and we put them in the schools, universities, just like we said. Just like my father did. Your father lived in less complicated times. And there's no excuse for us. If anyone can deal with these gringos, I can do it. You know I would never sell our people out, don't you? Yes... I do. This... This is to a new day. A new beginning. And watching the utter destruction of our enemies. Hey, Nero. Listen, amigo. The next guy, Omar Chavez. They tell me he's now risen to one of the top cartel dealers right behind me, which I find personally insulting. I mean, this is a bad guy. They deal in human trafficking. - We don't do that shit, do we? No! - No. We have honor. And international arms dealing. Understand this, we are a cartel. We know we kill each other and live by the sword, you die by the sword. But these guys, they kill innocent civilians for nothing. So, I don't want you to worry about your karma on this one, okay, amigo? Here's the truth... The truth, Nero, this one's not gonna be easy. You're gonna have to bring out the big guns, Papa. Everything. But I'm trusting you, and so is your son. We're trusting you to handle this situation, and by that, I mean... Wait, let me take a wild guess. Everyone needs to die? You see that? Exactamente señor. What a surprise. We're like brothers, huh? We're on the same page. Nero, you were right. You were right. Listen to this. Nero! Nero! Nero! Nero! Nero! Nero! Nero! Nero! Nero! Nero...! You hear that? Nero, you have the undying support of me and my men. Vamanos. Hey Callenle. Ready to win? Yas, take him. Load him up. They attacked the club. Machado's club. They also killed the Roja and Garza gangs in Garza's hotel. How did that happen? Do they know who did it? They're saying it was a one-man job. Please, one guy took out an entire team?! Three entire teams?! For the love of God. That's what they're saying. Machado died? Yes. We must alert the boys, we could be next. Do you think it could be Mzamo Lascano? Nah, no this is isn't a street issue. This is CIA. MI6. Government Intelligence, you know? Final round, coming up. No fucking way he's getting through this. - Buenos dias. - Buenos dias. Gracias. Yeah! They broke into the compound. - Who? - We're not sure. Amen. That's a crazy motherfucker! Looks like our boy's not going to make it. You have nothing to fear, Donovan. Omar, we almost got you, pendejo. Now we're gonna have to go clean up the mess. Huh? Damn, fucking Brit put up a good fight. Kinda sad to see him go. You know, when you try to kill a black mamba... No, a lion fighting to protect its pride, it's familia. The future, the lion will fight to the death, huh? That's what the gringo lion, he did for us. - He fought. - Yeah. He deserves our respect. Huh? Interesting night. Omar will figure out that I'm behind the attack. He'll come here for me. I'll be ready for him. I'll send the men to clean up the mess. All right, then. We take the fight to him. Muchachos, take care of business today. Tomorrow we handle everything on both sides of the border for a generation. Vamanos! Who are you? Do I know you? Or why I am your enemy? Or Machado, for that matter? We've been looking into your phone, and we found this video. This is your boy? They're gonna kill him. Who? You tell me. Why would I know? So, they forced you to do this? Whoever it is, they want you and the other cartel heads taken care of. And you've never even seen him? No, I just heard his voice. All right, on the other end of a phone. We just talk about trust, yeah? Other than that, I don't have a fucking clue, mate. - You said, "trust?" - Yeah, trust. Talked a lot about trust. Mzamo... You're talking about the cartel head? - Do you know him? - I've heard of him. Mzamo is the only one with the balls to do something like this. He has been trying to consolidate power for years now. They took my son. Where is he? If he's in Mexico, he has a... near the beach. South of Playa La Mision. Are you CIA? MI6? It doesn't really matter, does it? I'm sorry you got mixed up in all this, about your kid. But you came to my home with bad intentions... and this is how it's going to end for you. May your enemies respect you. May God protect you. And may death neglect you. Maybe we should wait... until we hear back from your men that Chavez and his crew have been neutralized. I'm not sure any of us should be celebrating. So, what's next? Call a meeting with whoever is alive. They have to join us. I've always been the man with the plan to expand out of it. The problem is, they've always had a limited vision. We're gonna be moving into technology. Clean fuels, universities, and politics. Make the cartels great again, and let them pay for it. Donovan, in this new, brave new world, there's a seat for you at the table, my friend. I'm going to need your government contacts, your counsel. I need to know who's moving against me, and why. I need to know which politicians are ready to play ball. I'll do what I can. I always do. Yes. I'll make you a rich man, amigo. You already have. So, what about that loose end? I mean, you know we're gonna have to take care of that situation, right? Hm? What loose end? You know what I mean. What, are we killing children now? We do what we need to do. Give me the keys. You know, um... if you want to be the jefe around here... you've got to learn to make the tough calls. Donovan, save your speeches. I'm good at what I do. I never claimed to be a saint, but if you're gonna start killing children, you keep that away from us. That is on you. All right. Open it. It has to be Nero. Stay with me! That kid's gone. It's Nero. It's not Nero, Donovan. It's me. You can tell a lot by a man's actions. Yours are very disappointing. I'll have no kid-killing on my watch. I moved the boy somewhere safe from you. Nero is dead. I wouldn't hold my breath for that, pal! Hello, Nero. Donovan? You're not going to tell me this was for Queen and country, are you? Not exactly. You know, I always had a sneaky suspicion, maybe it was you that betrayed me, killed my wife. But I never dared to believe it. Well, it's a rough business we're in. And a dangerous one. We do what we... Shit. Bueno. - Mzamo. - Nero. So resilient. You want to tell me what the fuck is going on? How about, "Thank you, Mzamo, for helping to save my life?" Where's my son, dickhead? You want to see your son. I understand. You want him to see this? Alanza, get the man his boy. Meet us inside. Hey! You try anything, he gets it. Let's go. - Dad! - Taylor! - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah? I could kill you two right now. Yes, you could, but then what would happen, Nero? Tomorrow there'd be a new man here to take my place. When they find you, trust me, they will find you, you and your son will be in the same exact predicament. I don't claim to be a good man, but I am a man who keeps his word. I gave you back your son. Here's what I think we should do; You go, live at your house at the beach, we leave you alone, we run North Baja, try to see what good we can do with it. You're dreaming, pal. It's not like I went in there incognito, is it? They've seen my face. They know who I am. Now what's left of those cartels, they're going to be looking for all of us, for me and my son. As of today, Nero, I control everything. There are no more cartels. I am the last man standing. This is a one in a lifetime offer, my friend. I am the only one that can guarantee you and your son safety. You can't guarantee anything, pal. You're in control for this afternoon, at best. I may have underestimated you, Nero, but now you're underestimating me. I am a survivor. I will be here, just like mi padre. I promised you, I gave you my word you would get your son back. I kept my word. And now I give you my word again. You never have to see us again in this lifetime. Sometimes the devil you know is a lot better than the devil you don't. Fine. But if I ever see your face again... I know. You'll kill us all. Come here, buddy. Are you okay? Why didn't you kill him? Do you trust him? No, I don't trust him. Of course not. It's like I was trying to tell you before. Not everything has to be solved with violence. Sometimes, yeah, but other times... better to use strategy, yeah? See, now that devil knows I can kill him whenever I want... and that's the type of devil I like. Understand? Yeah? Come here. Let's get out of here. All right, buddy. Let's get you in the car. What about the bike? What you mean, the Harley? Yeah. Do you know how to ride it? Yeah, sure. Just, uh... I might be a little rusty. - Hey, Dad? - Yeah? Can you teach me how to throw a proper punch, now? Uh... I don't know, mate, because, uh, from what your principal tells me... ...you've been knocking people out all semester.
