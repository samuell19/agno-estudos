Hey babe, how was your day? Busy. Busy good? No, not so much. Oh yeah? Well, I'm about ready. Then we can get going. No, let's just stay in tonight. It'll just take a second. I'm almost done. No, it was a long day. We can eat here. You sure? We haven't gone out in forever. Yeah. What're you doing? I'm gettin' dressed. I see that, why? So I can get going. You're leaving? Yeah, it's late. I know it's late, but you don't have to leave. Why would I stay? Why? I don't know. Maybe because we just had sex. Yeah, and now we're done and it's late. Yeah, you said that already. I have to wake up early for work. So set an alarm. I'm not staying the night. So what, this is just a one-night stand then? Why're you getting upset? I start work early. I don't have any clothes here and there's gonna be traffic in the morning. It makes no sense for me to stay the night. You didn't answer my question, so this is just a one-night stand then. Well, originally no. But now, I'm thinking yes. - Yes? - Look how you're acting. How I'm acting? Maybe if you weren't such a self-centered asshole, you would know that you don't just have sex with somebody and leave. Fine, you want me to stay? I can stay for like 15 more minutes, will that make you happy? Just get the hell out. I said I'd stay. No, get out. Fine, psycho. Asshole. Hey. I miss you. Oh, Sam. So it's my friend Jessica's birthday tonight. Owen, are you listening? Yes. It's my friend Jessica's birthday tonight. She asked me to go out with her. We're gonna be drinking, doing drugs, dancing with random men. At some point, we're goin' to the strip club and I plan on dancing on stage naked. And if all goes well, I'll probably go home with someone or multiple someones. Do you mind? Owen. Yeah, what? I asked you a question. Yeah babe, whatever you want. I gotta go to work. Bye. Look at her, Cooper. Yeah. She's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I think today's finally the day I go talk to her. Yeah, yeah, I know I've been saying that for weeks, but today's different. I can feel it. You know, on second thought, today really doesn't feel much different than every other day. Whatever. I'm just Just gonna do it. I'm gonna go talk to her. What do I say? Hi, I like your face. Yeah, yeah, that'll work out great. Hey, I'm Theodore and I think you're incredibly pretty. Since you started coming here, suddenly all the love songs are about you. Yeah, no. Come on, think. What would Ed Sheeran say? I'm telling you, he loves that phone more than he loves me. The first thing he wakes up to in the morning and the last thing he sees at night. If I didn't cook for him, he'd probably forget I even exist. Hey, knock that crap the F-off! I will beat you in public. Is everything okay? Yeah, it's just Austin bein' a complete idiot like always. I swear when it comes to that kid, the bells are ringing, lights are flashing and the gates were down, but the train isn't coming. Anyway, what were you saying? I was telling you about Owen and how he gives his phone more attention than he does me. Right. You know what? When your uncle ignores me, I just walk around the house naked or wear his favorite lingerie outfit, but mainly naked. Thanks for the visual, Aunt Grace. I really needed that. You know what your problem is? You dress like a schoolteacher and not in a good, dreamy, sexy way like a 1950's schoolteacher with tenure. Thanks. I'm being serious. You want his attention, don't you? Yeah. Well, you have to get it from between his legs. I will keep that in mind. Dammit, this kid! If dumb were dirt, we wouldn't have to come to the park for him to play outside. I'm gonna have to call you back later. Bye. Pick-up lines. Nope, nope. Too offensive. Too overused. Okay. Okay, I think I got one. Sorry about my dog. Okay, bye. Oh, wait. I like your face. Huh? I, I mean uh, do you mind filling out a quick survey? I guess not. What's the survey for? Uh, here. Here you go. Well, it was nice meeting you. Yeah, it was nice to meet you too. You see that? I got her number. Yes! Yes! "Happy birthday to mom and dad's second favorite kid. "I bought you a cool gift, but I decided to keep it. "Anyway, here's $25. "Here's $4.00 "and 61 cents. "Don't say I never got you anything." Finn, they need you at my party. What? Notice how I said they, mom and dad, not me. I can't open any presents without you. Now, come on. Come on. I'm coming. Do you mind if I sit here? I'm Evie, by the way. Sam. Nice to meet you, Sam. This is a nice view of the park. I can see why you like sitting here. Really puts things in perspective. It's kinda like those sayings. You know like, "If you give a fellow money "and you never see him again, it was probably worth it." Or "If you think no one cares if you're dead or alive, "just miss a few credit card payments." You know what always confused me? When somebody says, "I'm not book smart, I'm street smart." Whenever anybody says that, all I hear is, "I'm not real smart, I'm imaginary smart." So What kinda sandwich is that? It looks good. I'm sorry if I'm bothering you. I come to this park often and I always see you sitting here and you just you look so lonely. I just wanted to say hi. I'll go, have a nice day. Peanut butter and jelly. Huh? It's a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Oh, love me some PB&J. I have another half if you want it. Yeah, if you don't mind. Sam, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Not if you eat half my sandwich every time, Humphrey Bogart. Sam, I think I should make the sandwiches next time. How was the date? You gonna meet up with her again? She turned out to be a psycho, so no. Really? I told you, you need to stop using Tinder. It's the only app people are using. What are you talking about? There's tons of apps. You know what you should try? This new blind dating app I heard about. So what, it just sends you out on a random blind date? No. Well, maybe. You just talk to people without photos. You know, get to know them first. Yeah, it sounds kinda corny. It also sounds like a great way to get catfished or robbed. Please. If anyone is gonna be catfished, it's gonna be the girl. Have you not seen a mirror? Remind me why we're friends again. Can you believe that guy? As soon as he finished, he was out the door. Well, what'd you expect? You said you met him off Tinder, right? Yeah, but this one seemed different. Yeah, but they all seem different. Then you meet them in person and find out all they want is sex with no strings attached. I'm gonna die single. Oh you should try this blind date app I heard about. I'm done with online dating for a while. No, this one's different though. Oh, okay. You don't upload any photos or give out your name. That matches you based on compatibility and you just talk. Sounds pretty corny, don't you think? At least give it a try. What do you have to lose? It's not like men are breaking down your door anyways. Remind me why we're friends again. The vic was looking at pornography when someone stabbed him in the eyes. Looks like he went blind from too much masturbation. Hey, it's me, Theodore. Just wanted to say what's up? Wait. I never told her my name. Hey, it's the guy you met at the park today. The one who asked you to fill out the survey, but it wasn't a survey. My name's Theodore by the way. Anyway, just wanted to say what's up? Ahhh. Way too long. Why do I keep putting what's up? Who says what's up anymore? Okay, just-- just keep it simple. Hey Bailey, this is Theodore. I met you at the park today. Just wanted to say it was nice meeting you. Hey, it was nice meeting you too. "It was nice meeting you too." Yes! Yes, yes. Okay. Okay, Theodore. Be cool. Hey. I know we just met and this is probably way too soon, but do you wanna get married? Why's this so hard? All right babe, Jessica's here. I'm leaving. You're goin' out? Yeah, with my friend Jessica. It's her birthday today. I told you this morning. Right. What time are you comin' home? I'm not sure. I wouldn't wait up though. Nicole. Before you go, did you cook anything? Yeah, it's in the oven. Just heat it up. How was your day? It's better now. Is it? Come dance with me. There's no music. - Then play some. C'mon. Are you just gonna sit there? Get over here. ♪ There's no other feelin' when I'm next to you ♪ ♪ No one else around ♪ ♪ Just the space for two ♪ ♪ There's no better feelin' ♪ You call that dancing? You know I don't like to dance.

I guess I can always delete it if anything. Summer, you need to get your life together. Okay. Blind dating app. Search. Whoa, whoa. Sorry. I should've been there to catch you. I'm Jace, by the way. Nicole. You here with your boyfriend? No, my girlfriend. It's her birthday. But looks like she ditched me for some guys, so I'm calling a rideshare home. - Ooh, yeah. - Yeah. Shucks. What happened? My driver just canceled. What? No way, that sucks. Yeah. Hey, I'll be right back, okay? Hey, did somebody order a four-door sedan with a five-star safety rating? And we are here, safe and sound. First time I've been able to say that since becoming a driver. Thank you for the ride. Mm-hmm. Hey, Nicole. You think I could take you out sometime? I'd love to, but I have a boyfriend. Oh well, I have a Facebook profile. Okay. Sorry, I just thought we were talkin' about shit that doesn't matter. Well you have a good night, Nicole and try to not let the police catch you on the way out. The police? Yeah, for stealing my heart and running away with it. You have a good night too, Jace. Goodnight. Not right now, Nicole. I'm watchin' something. I just wanted a kiss. Fine. I was gonna go have lunch with a friend today, unless you wanted to do something together. No, it's fine. You can go. Are you sure? It's your day off. I can cancel. I'm sure he won't mind. He? Yeah, my friend Jace. Have I met him? I don't think so. He's tall, handsome. I met him last night outside the club. So should I cancel? What? Should I cancel with him? No no no, it's fine. You can go. Okay then. Hey so according to this site, we're a match. You describe yourself as female. Can you provide any proof? Wow, you really know how to sweep a lady off her feet. What kinda proof are you looking for? I'm pretty sure photos aren't allowed. I can mail you a cup of urine. Would that suffice? Gross, no. I'm not your probation officer. You keep your urine. Hmm, let me think. Pop quiz? I'm game. First question. What kinda shoes do you want? Sneakers, boots, sandals. No heels? Maybe. Next question. What kinda toys did you play with as a kid? Stuffed animals. Next? I can see this is gonna get me far. Does that mean you're giving up? I sit when I pee, if that helps. You could just have really bad aim. But it's the only helpful answer you've given me so far, so thank you. You're welcome. So do I need to quiz you? It says you're male, but how to be sure? I could always mail you my urine. And if anything, save it for when you go in for your weekly UA. Well hey, I have to get goin' to work. Talk later, yeah? 'Of course, have a good day at work. All right, there you go. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Ooh, hold on. Before you cast those dreamy eyes on me, let me make sure I have the day free. Okay, go. So do you always look this pretty when you go to the bookstore? I was tryin' to make my boyfriend jealous. Hmm, how's that workin' out? Not so well. Just a thought: If you're tryin' to make him jealous, maybe don't tell him you're goin' to the bookstore. Yup, what would you have told him? I don't know. Maybe that you're going on a date with a handsome guy, like with me for instance. Thanks, I'll keep that in mind for next time. Glad I could help. You know, I am glad I ran into you. I was seriously considering camping out on your block until you needed another rideshare. That's not a bit stalkerish. I was thinkin' more hopelessly romantic. Besides, detectives, they do it all the time. Maybe, but you're not a detective now, are you? Maybe I am. You're a detective. Me, a detective? Why, what have you heard? Who told you? I swear it wasn't like that. What did they say? So what, you don't think you're worth it? Worth what? Worth some guy spending endless nights cramped in his car, peeing in bottles, showering in sprinklers, shitting in mailboxes just hoping he'll get a chance to see you again? - Shitting in mailboxes. - Yeah. I don't know. You are. Trust me. I had fun today. I had fun too. Do I get to see you again? I'd like that, but I have a boyfriend. I know. You know if you were Christmas, I would be the Grinch who stole you. I don't think I'll ever stop thinkin' about you, not tonight, not tomorrow, never. Wait a moment. Sorry about that. I'm sorry, that was a mistake. Hey, babe. Something wrong? I gotta tell you something. Yeah? Nevermind, it's nothing. I'm goin' to bed. - Nicole. - Yeah? Can you make me food first? There's food in the fridge. Figure it out. What crawled up her ass? Good morning. Hope you have a good day and maybe I'll see you at the park later? Smiley face. Hey, good morning. Yeah, for sure. See you there. Hi. Hi. Don't tell me you made a sandwich. Okay, I won't. Well, did you? - Did I what? - Make a sandwich. You just told me not to tell you. You know exactly what I mean. I told you next time I would make the sandwiches. It's a good-looking sandwich, right? Yes, by far the most attractive sandwich I've ever seen. Do you think it's single? Go on, try it. Way better than that crusty-old sandwich you've been eating. Crusty-old sandwich? Wow. - I'm just being honest. - Wow. What'd you put in here? Oh, it's just this nut butter blend I made. It's almond butter, pine-nut butter, Are you okay? Did you say pine-nuts? Yeah, why? Yeah, I'm allergic to tree nuts. - You are? I had no idea. - Yeah, yeah. - I thought with the P.B.-- - How's my face look? How's my face? Is it swellin' up? - No. - Is it swellin' up? No? You look fine, but should we go to the hospital? All right quick, quick. My EpiPen, it's in here. - It's in here, it's in here. - Okay. All right. C'mon, c'mon. Um, I don't-- I don't see it. Where is it? I'm just kidding. What? I had to get you back somehow for callin' my sandwich crusty. Jerk. Evie? Yeah, Sam? I think I'll let you make the sandwiches from now on. Right here. Max. Yes. Good boy. C'mon, Cooper. Hey. Hi. So how's your day going? Good. Oh and uh, what about yours? It's great. Well, I'm going to get Max some exercise. It was nice seeing you. Come on, Max. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Come on, Theodore. Get it together, man. You're blowin' it. What? It's called a power pose. It gives you confidence. It works, okay? You're so judgemental. Okay, you got this. Hey. Hey. So um, sorry to bother you. Just wanted to see if you have plans Friday night and if maybe you'd be hungry? No plans. And yeah, I'm sure I'll be hungry by then. Great. Um would you like to go with me to eat? Sure. Really? I mean, okay. Awesome. Hey you, how was your day? I got away with speeding and several other misdemeanors. So on the whole, I'm satisfied. What about yours? Mine was amazing. One of the worst days of my life. After two weeks of straight good days, I was ready for a change. Yeah, sounds like you were overdue. Anything interesting happen today? Define interesting. Interesting, adjective: arousing a feeling of interest. Smart ass. Well I did discover the secret of life. Really? Do tell. Tell you what: 10 bucks and it's all yours. $10, is that all? Well if you knew the secret of life, you wouldn't think it was worth much either. In that case, maybe I shouldn't know. I'll just stick to thinking it's chocolate. Should we meet? You're not gonna make a sandwich? Not today. But you always pack a lunch. Well, there's this girl. There's a girl? It's not like that. She's just someone that's been coming to the park. You like her. I mean, I guess she's okay. Just okay? All right, fine. She's better than okay. But-- But? But she's not me. No, she's not. Sam, maybe it's time. Do you mind if I sit here? Uh-- I'm a-- I'm tryin' to make that woman over there jealous. That homeless woman sleeping? Is she homeless? Why on earth would you wanna make her jealous? She's actually my ex. Your ex? Yes. Since we broke up, life has not been easy for her. No, I'd say not. So what shall we talk about? Talk about? As in a conversation? I don't know about all that. I'm not even sure about you sitting here. Certainly wouldn't wanna end up like your ex. I certainly wouldn't want that either. The name's Finn, by the way. Penelope. Penelope. That's a nice name, it suits you. Well Finn, it was lovely meeting you. You're leavin' already? Yes. Would you hold this for me while I walk with you? Come along then. Sam. Sam. I made sandwiches again. I don't think I can do this anymore. But you don't have to eat it, we can just sit. No, it's not the sandwiches. I'm talking about this. I can't do this. What exactly is this? This. You and me sittin' together every day like we're-- Like we're what? Like we're friends. And we both know you and me, we can't be friends. And why not? Because eventually it's gonna lead to something more. I see, so you're afraid that this might lead to more and you don't wanna take that chance? Am I so bad? You know what? I was just tryin' to be nice. So whatever, Sam. I'll leave you alone. Evie. So you live in London, you fly home tomorrow and you're just tellin' me this? When would I have told you? We only just met. Just my luck. I meet this girl, we have this connection and she's leavin'. Connection? Yeah. Wait, you're tellin' me you don't feel it? Like on a scale of one to 10, what would you say? I'm guessing by your face, a three? Okay, not what I was expecting. A two? Really, a one. A one outta 10. A zero. Thank you for leaning in while you said that. I could feel the cold breeze comin' off your icy heart. You know, the problem with you leavin' is that today's laundry day. All my outfits are clean. We have a date tomorrow, a lotta possibilities. So what all have you done since you been here? Mainly just studying. Studying. Yes, I'm here on student visa. You've been here for like three months and all you've been doing is studying? Yes, I've been proper busy with exams and school work, I'll have you know. Something I'm sure you know little of. No, we have to change that right now. C'mon. Where are we going? You'll see. Trust me. Hi, ready to order? I'll have what she's having. I'll have the seafood and rice soup. Did, did you say seafood? Yeah, why? Actually, can-- can I get my menu back? I'ma-- I'm allergic to fish. I can come back. I'll have a-- the lemon chicken rice soup. ♪ Never think about tomorrow ♪ ♪ Just tonight ♪ ♪ Every step is tied to what we dream ♪ ♪ When all we got is you and me ♪ ♪ Every step is tied to what we dream ♪ ♪ Ooh when all we got is you and me ♪ ♪ Every step is tied to what we dream ♪ ♪ When all we got is you and me ♪ ♪ We got it ♪ ♪ Every step is tied to what we dream ♪ ♪ What we dream ♪ ♪ When all we got ♪ ♪ When all we got is you and me ♪ How's your soup? It's good. Yours? It's good. Yeah, very lemony. Plus there's rice. Rice is good when you're really hungry and want 1,000 of something. Would you excuse me for a minute? Get it together, man. So Bailey, talk nerdy to me. What is the ugliest vegetable? I don't think there's such thing as an ugly vegetable. But if I had to choose, I'd say kale on principle. Because kale. You're telling me. Ever since kale, I've had to sleep with the lights on. And although not ugly, I don't much like onions either. Onions, why? They make me sad and not a lotta people seem to realize that. Any other vegetables I should know about? Nope, just the two. So Bailey, maybe you can help me with this. At what age should I tell Cooper he's adopted? That's a tough one. If you told him now, how do you think he would take it? Well if he takes it as well as when I tell him in a minute, then good. In a minute? Yeah. You know, in a minute? Like when he's beggin' for something and I say, "In a minute, Cooper." But what I really mean is please forget. And he does, every time. You uh-- You don't do that with Max? Sometimes. I found it also works on small children. This is me. I had fun today. You're quite the tour guide. Right? Subtract the survival skills, historical significance and boobs, I'm basically Sacagawea. What's the matter? Am I ever gonna see you again? Finn. I'm sorry, I'm ruinin' the night and I don't mean to. Gimme your phone. There, now you have my number. If you're ever in London, call me. So are you gonna kiss me or do I have to lie to my diary? Goodnight, Finn. Goodnight, Penelope. Seriously though, call me. I will. You better. I had fun tonight. Tonight was fun, wasn't it? - Oh. - Oh, sorry. What was that? You're afraid of cats? Cats? Oh, look at that. A really nonthreatening house cat. Well, I'm gonna get goin'. Call you later? Yeah, I'd like that. Okay, bye. Bye. Austin, get your finger out of your nose. No, don't eat it! Oh, I can't deal with this kid today. Hey, have you seen a bottle of pills in your kitchen? Pills? Yeah, I hid them there, so that your uncle wouldn't find them. No, wait a minute. I know where they're at. I hid them in Austin's room. What? I'm joking. Relax. Okay fine, they're in there. But come on, we're talking Austin here. You think he can open up a pill bottle with that safety thing on it? That kid can't even open up a book. I kissed him. Who are we talkin' about exactly? Jace. I met him on Jessica's birthday and then we ended up spending the whole day together and I kissed him. Is he cute? Did you tell Owen? Yes, he's cute. And I was gonna tell Owen, but he never listens to me, ever. So what would even be the point? I don't know, I just feel so alone when I'm with Owen. But Jace, he makes me feel wanted. Listen, I wasn't gonna tell you this 'cause I know how much you like Owen. But maybe it's time you let that frog hop on back to the swamp. But I love him and I don't wanna hurt him. Well something's gotta change, unless you wanna be miserable forever. We've been talkin' for a few weeks. How is it too soon? You don't even know what he looks like. I mean, what if he turns out to be a total creep? Well if he does, I'll have you to thank. Me? Yes, you. You were the one that told me to sign up. Well I didn't think you were gonna go and fall in love. Please, I'm not in love. We just barely met. Summer, I know you and I know when you're in love. Obviously not, because I'm not in love. If you say so. I'm not. Okay, well call me after your date tomorrow so I know you're safe. Okay, mom. I'm being serious. If I don't hear from you, I'll call the cops. You know I will. I'll call. You better. Okay. Love you, bye. Bye. Pfft, I'm not in love. You actually signed up for it? What do you mean you actually signed up? You told me to. Yeah, but I didn't think you'd do it. Yeah well, I did and I met one person. That's it? Only one? I thought you don't use photos. Did you describe yourself in the bio? Funny. I don't think a lotta people use it. It's the city. Of course a lot of people use it. Fine, millions of people use it and I have one match. You happy? Remind me again of all of the triumphs you've had in your dating life. Ouch. Well, how is she? I like her. Yeah? Yeah, I really do. She's smart and she's bit of a smart ass. Do you know what she looks like? No idea. What are you gonna do if you're being catfished? Really? What? It could happen. Yeah, I know. I said that to you when you told me to sign up. You did? Yeah and you blew it off like it was a joke. Well, I'm sure she looks fine. But have her send a photo just in case. There's no point. I'm meeting her in person tomorrow. Nice. Can I come with? What? In case she's not what you expected. Fine. What's wrong? Nothing. Sam, I know you. It's just-- It's just? I don't know. Sam, tell me. I don't wanna lose you. You're not gonna lose me. No? How would I not? Don't you get it? You live here in my heart. Willow, all of this is yours. If I let anyone else in, it'd be like like I'm replacing you and I can't do that to you. I can't. I love you too much. Sam, I'll always be with you. Yeah. What do you know? You're not even real. So what are we lookin' for? Female, late 20s sitting alone in a red dress. Do you think that's her? What is your deal, man? Remember that terrible date I told you about, the Tinder one? Weren't all of your Tinder dates terrible? The most recent one. Oh yeah, I remember. That's the girl. What? No way. Oh, she is cute. You think that's your blind date? Do you see anyone else sitting alone in a red dress? Nope, just her. Maybe she's running late. Message her. Sent. Is she checkin' her phone? Oh yeah. And I think she's messaging you back. What'd she say? It's her. Oh man, what are you gonna do? Sent. Come on. Wait, what? You're going to hate me. Something came up and I can't make it. Rain check? Owen. Owen. What? Hey, what're you doing? You're always on this damn phone. You never give me any attention anymore and I'm tired of it. You're exaggerating. I'm not always on it. Yes, you are. I want you to choose, either this phone or me. What? That's ridiculous. I'm not going to choose. What is this about? Is this because we don't go out? Fine, we'll go out. I said choose. And I said I'm not going to. Now gimme back my damn phone. You're acting crazy right now. Fine, you want me to choose? All right, I choose you. Now can I have my phone? I'll put it away. I need it for work. I thought you said you were only visiting. Why are you selling all your stuff? I am, but I kinda need money to get there and back. Unless you wanna let me borrow some? Absolutely not. Do mom and dad know that you're going to London? Lilly please, I'm an adult. They don't have to know. On the outside, technically yes, you're an adult. But up here, we're talking preschool. Is that car for sale? No. I'll give you three grand for it. No, man, I'm still makin' payments on it. I got cash. Sold. Case in point. Shut up. This place is a disaster. Nasty, Summer. Whatever. You need to forget about this guy. How long has it been since you last spoke? A week. A week and no response, it is time to move on. He's obviously not interested. Maybe something happened to him. Yeah, or maybe he came to the restaurant and saw-- Saw what? Go on, say what you're gonna say. Maybe he saw you and you're not his type. I don't like seeing you like this. Summer, you need to forget about this guy. It is for your own good! Could we slow down? What's your deal today? Nothin'. No, why are you tryin' to gimme a heart attack? It's that girl, isn't it? Could we talk about somethin' else, like maybe how are you so outta shape? No no no, don't turn this around on me. Have you messaged her since the restaurant? Drop it. You haven't, have you? I said drop it, okay? I thought you liked her. Message her and say what? Like hey, I know we clicked on here. But remember that one-night stand you had a few weeks ago and the guy wanted to leave because he had work in the morning and then you totally lost your shit? Well that guy was me, Calvin. I wouldn't send that exact message. I'm not messaging her. I thought we were resting. The silicone in her breast implants are what killed her. Looks like those party boobs were a party foul. Quick, quick. Romance movie or horror? Romance or horror? Umm, romance. Ha ha. Modern or classic, modern or classic? Classic of course. Pizza or burgers? Quick. Hmm, pizza. Thanks. Are you gonna tell me what that was all about? Dinner and a movie, your place. Tomorrow at eight. You in or are you out? Smiley face, I'm in. I'm ready, let's go. Not tonight, I'm tired. Really? You said we were going out, Owen. I got all ready and everything again. And we will just not tonight, Nicole. And what about your phone? What about it? You said you'd stay off it. I really just wanna relax right now. Can we talk about this later? So what do you think? Should we move in? Sam, what are you up to? I'm just askin' if we should move in because it's kind of ours. You didn't. Get over here. I can't believe you bought a house without me. You're lucky I like it. - Sam. - Yeah? Something doesn't feel right. Willow. What's wrong? Willow, Willow, Willow. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, Willow. Willow, Willow! C'mon, wake up, wake up, wake up. Willow! C'mon, c'mon. No no no, c'mon. Hey, Sam. Remember this photo? Our first date. That was a good day. I want you to always remember me like that. Not like this, got it? I said do you got it? Yeah, I got it. Now this next request isn't going to be easy, but you're gonna have to do it no matter how much you don't want to; for me. I need you to let yourself fall in love again. You're the love of my life and I can't let you spend the rest of your life heartbroken. Sam. I will always cherish the time we had together, but it's time for the next chapter of your story. So until we meet again one day, I love you. Try to stay outta trouble. I love you too. Owen. Hey, where's my coffee? I gotta go soon. Owen. What? I think we need a break. Did you hear me? I said I think we need a break. Owen. Yeah, whatever you say. I'm gonna be late. I'll see you later. Hey stranger, just wanted to say that I know what happened and I understand. You came to the restaurant, you didn't like what you saw and left. I get it. I probably would've done the same and I'm not mad. If you're tryin' to say I saw you and I think you're ugly, you couldn't be more wrong. It's you that'll be disappointed. Excuse me, I'll be the judge of whether or not I'm disappointed and you still owe me a rain check, remember? Yes, I remember. Your place in an hour? But you don't know where I live. Oh, yeah. I guess I'll just have to knock on every door in the city. This could take a while. Maybe make it two hours? Or I could make it easy, we could just meet at the park, the one on Jefferson. Okay, I'll message you when I get there. Oh and if you turn out to be a creepy stalker, I have pepper spray. Thanks for the warning. I'll make sure to catch you off-guard. See you soon. You're getting on that plane. No Dick, I don't wanna go. What about last night? Last night you were all dolled-up in that push-up contraption that makes your As look like Cs. I was goofy on giggle juice. I would've just said damn near anything to play the horizontal polo. You're just saying that because you want me to go. I'm saying it because it's true. Deep down inside, we both know you belong on that plane with that other guy, whatever his name is. If you'd stay, it won't end well. We'll end up married, children, hating each other. You'll get fat and I'll end up cheating on you three times a week. I don't believe you. Just believe that if you don't get on that plane, you're going to regret it. No! Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. But one day when you're washing my clothes and you find women's panties balled up in my pocket and for the rest of your life. But I said that I would never leave you. Dammit woman, can't you see that our problems won't amount to a hill of garbanzo beans in this crazy world? Now, now. Here's lookin' at you, kid. Oh, thanks. You know when I said classic, I was thinking a little less classic. How less? Early 2000s, maybe late 90s. I'm offended. You call those classics? Yes. Millennials. Aren't you a millennial too? Am I? You're right, I am. Quick, I need a distraction. Do you wanna see a magic trick? Sure. Here, gimme your hands. Isn't this magical? Maybe we should go to my room. What, really? - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, okay. Let's go. Little help here. Hey. Oh, it's you. Um, I'm actually meeting someone, so. I know. You know? Yes. I'm the one you're meeting. I'm sorry about the other day at the restaurant. I was there. But when I realized it was you, you looked beautiful by the way; I-- I just knew you'd be let down, so I left. I'm sorry. This was stupid. It's just that you-- you said, "I didn't like what I saw," and I wanted you to know that I did. I really liked what I saw. Goodbye, Summer. I hope I didn't ruin your night. Hey. You were wrong. About? Me being disappointed. Owen, I've been so lonely for so long. We haven't had a real conversation in ages and I can't even remember the last time you looked at me when I talked to you. I hope you find happiness. Maybe you already have. Your phone seems to make you smile more than I ever did. But it can't be with me, not anymore. I hope you understand and know that I will always love you. Nicole? Um-- Just gimme one sec. You don't work tomorrow? I do. Hello? Finn? You're here? Yeah, yeah I know where it is. Okay, I'll see you soon. Hey, how's your day going? Do you know if this car has a five-star safety rating? Nicole? You would not believe how many rideshares I've had to take to find you. Hey. Hey. So where am I taking you? I was hoping you'd tell me. Do you mind if I sit with you? It's a public park, so I guess not. Look, I'm sorry about the other day. My wife passed away a couple years ago. And ever since then, well it hasn't been easy. And when you came around, I wasn't ready. But I am now. I'm sorry, Sam. Yeah. That's okay. I packed a lunch today. Yeah and we've both had the lunch you've packed. I got you these. They're lovely. I was afraid you wouldn't call. Please. In the words of the late Marvin Gaye and four years later by Diana Ross, "There ain't no mountain high, "ain't no valley low to keep me from you." I'm just glad you answered and you're still single. On the plane, I realized I probably shoulda told you I was coming. You are still single, right? Finn, it's only been a week. I know. Have you not seen yourself? I don't remember my dreams, but I assume you've been in all of them since we met. Would you stop talking and kiss me already?
