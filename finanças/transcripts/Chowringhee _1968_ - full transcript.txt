You know, Rosy. my earlier typist. She used to stay here. That was very much beneficial for the management. So it would be better if you stay here.

You are really a child, why shall we come and take shelter.. ..over here if we have good mattress?

Actually serving the staff of the hotel instead of.. ..the boarders are like.. ..leaving the job of Burma Shell and joining Makhanlal Hajra's.. ..whole sale spice shop as a clerk. The manager hasn't beaten him.. ..but has stopped his way of earning extra. He sent him directly from the fountain of tips.. ..to this desert of terrace. our head orderly, Parabashia.. ..had decided to get his daughter married to Guruberia. But I heard that knowing Guruberia's unfortunate situation.. ..Parabahsia has also decide to step back. So now he is serving me to get out of this problem. He thinks that I have great influence on Marco and Parabashia. And they won't be able to refuse if I request them. Come, sir. Do I need to go? No, no, why will you go? - Well. I'll go and arrange everything. So everything is alright, we'll meet tomorrow morning, good night. Let it be, I'll take care of that. Okay, I'll be waiting outside, sir, call me if.. ..you need something. - Okay. "I feel so lonely in this darkness." "Today the clouds are playing a lovely game in the sky." "Today the clouds are playing a lovely game in the sky." "I feel so lonely in this darkness." "I feel so lonely in this darkness." "Today the clouds are playing a lovely game in the sky." "All day long I was busy at work." "All day long I was busy at work." "I don't know how I was oblivious of this pain." "Who will tell me?" "Who will tell me?"

There is no other way, bro. when the cabaret ends at night. ..no trams or buses can be found in the streets of Kolkata. Come, let's have coffee, black coffee though, no milk, no sugar. Let it be, why do you bother yourself? Do you know that Braham, the great composer.. ..also used to have black coffee early in the morning. He has composed.. ..many unforgettable music while sipping coffee, take it. Braham's life inspires me a lot. I have learnt from him that. ..there are no sorrows in this world.. ..and the flower of music glorifies our sorrows. Good morning, sir. Mr. Bose is calling you in his room. Tell him that I am coming. - Okay, sir. I'll go now. - Give that to me. Greetings. May I come in? Come. Did you get tea on your bed? Tea on bed? - Bed tea. No, but I just had coffee. So you had terrace coffee? You are a lucky chap. Only two people in this world have the habit of.. ..drinking coffee at this hour. one is our Mr. Gomes. And the other is Mr. Brahmma of Germany. Do you mean Braham? It's all the same, did you sleep well last night? Yes. Initially you'll have problem. I also had problem. Any ways, get ready. we'll have breakfast together. Have some more tea. - No, not any more. Take some more gasoline.. you'll have to work for long. Good morning. - Good morning. Sorry, I came without notice. how do you do? Good, he is Mr. Byron, actually he helped me to get this job. I see, I see, how do you do, sir? How do you do? - And he is. Sata Bose, Satya Sunder Bose. receptionist of Sahajahan Hotel. He is the right hand man of Marco Polo, working here for 11 years. Previously he wanted to get a job in Grand Hotel through his uncle. My god! You made me sweat in the morning. Don't you worry, we are private detectives. It's our job to gather information.. ..gathering information is our capital.. ..and giving information is our business. Right, right, so Shankar, you carry on talking.. ..to Mr. Byron, I'll go now. Please don't go, I need to talk to you. I need your help. Please sit down. I received a bad news this morning.. ..and came here straight away. - What news? Rosy is coming back. My client Mrs. Banerjee caught her husband.. ..Mr. Banerjee and Rosy red handed. Mr. Banerjee is coming back to Kolkata like a docile child. What will Rosy do alone in Bombay? What will happen then? Don't get disheartened, get nerved, let me talk to Marco once. That's it. Let's go, get up, come on. You need not worry any more. - Thank you so much. Oh no, no, if you want to thank, thank Mr. Bose. He made it clear to Mr. Marco that reception counter needs.. ..more people to function properly. that was enough to convince Marco. So from onwards Rosy or no Rosy, your duty is in the counter. Do I have to work in the counter? That is no big deal. But you can speak so many languages so fluently. Listen, when I had joined this hotel then they had.. ..given an advertisement, they wanted a person who could speak.. ..Bengali like Rabindranath. English like Shakespeare.. ..and Hindi like Tulsidas. they got me as an answer.. Mr. Byron I had all required qualification. Only it was a little different. Okay, I'll leave now. Wish you every success, young man. Thank you. - Every success. Bye, Mr. Bose. - Bye. Cheer up. Good morning, Williams. - Morning, sir. Morning. Sorry, I'm late. - No, it's okay. Hello, Shankar. Good morning. Have a look! Nothing to mention. Have a look at the position. May I leave now? - Okay. Bye. - Good bye. - Good bye. Until you get your uniform.. ..do me a favour. Please type these. Please don't mind. - Not at all. Welcome, Rosy. Welcome. How do you do? - How do you do? What took you so long, naughty girl? Come in. Hello, man! Who are you? A young lady asked you something. You can't even answer! Can't you speak? I say, who are you? He is Mr. Bannerjee's brother-in-law. His cousin Khoka Chatterjee lives in Bombay. Do you follow that? I know, Sata.. ..you don't like me. But why? What have I done to you? You want to throw me out.. ..so that my family starves.. ..that's why, you've brought your cousin. So, you think I've brought my cousin to chase you away! Can you deny that? Rosy, I have never tried to snatch away anything from anyone. I hope it never comes to that. But your questions about Mr. Bannerjee have to be answered. Anyway, you stay here. I'm going to talk to Marco. No! You haven't been hired in this hotel for the advocacy of women. I have no time to listen to your cock and bull story. You've got to listen to it. Her mother wasn't well. She had informed us through a letter. That's a lie! Absolute lie! Don't believe a word she was saying. So, you want her whole family to starve. Her parents and siblings depend on her. Is that true? - It is true, sir. Alright! Go ahead. Do what you like. Thank you, sir. Sata, dear! What did he say? What did Marco say? Well, it's done, you can have your room occupied. And Shankar, take your stuff and shift to the room next to Rosy's. Will that do, Rosy? I don't know how to thank you. It's alright, come on. Take your bag. Now, Mr. Banerjee's brother-in-law, I have got you. If I say now that you have raped me..? Listen, please, I. Shut up, you have insulted me. I have met you just half an hour back. And I haven't spoken to you at all. You keep quiet, you are Mrs. Banerjee's brother. I am sure that you think that I have taken lots of money.. ..from Mr. Banerjee, lots of money. Believe me. I don't have any relation with Mr. Banerjee. I don't believe a word of yours. tell your sister that.. ..her husband is a beast. I didn't know that he is married. He bluffed me. All I wanted was a decent married life.. ..He cheated me. Please believe me. I have no relation with Mr. Banerjee. I don't even know him. Sorry. Sign here. That's all, thank you very much. Bell boy bring the key of suit no. 1, please proceed. Robertson came alone but he hired a double bed room. That's the best suit of our hotel. whose rate is 250 rupees per day. He must be a rich man. Not at all. I can bet that tonight she will come wearing dark glasses. Who is she? She whose husband has 7-8 cars in Kolkata city. But still she will come by a taxi. What are you saying? And I can also say that today Mr. X is not in Kolkata. Either he is in Bombay or in Delhi or might have gone to abroad.. ..for some business. Who is he? And who is she? Mrs. Pakrashi. She is a lost case in Madhab Pakrashi's account book. Mr. Pakrashi has everything in excess in his life. Many cars, many houses. lots of money, many companies. But what he had only one. That got spoiled. Meaning? Mrs. Pakrashi has no existence now. She does social work during the day and comes to this hotel at night. All day long she is very much Bengali. But here she is very much international. Her earlier boy friend was a 23 year old French guy. I think now she likes this English guy. Poor Mr. Pakrashi. Thank you, good bye. - Good bye. Good bye. - Good bye. Mrs. Pakrashi. Good evening, madam. Good evening. I hope the suit is booked. Yes, madam. Has Robert come. - Yes. Hello, Mrs. Pakrashi. Greetings, how are you Mr. Chaterjee? Don't ask me, I had absolutely forgotten that today is a dry day. I was working in my office. I came straight from there. But I came here and saw that the bar is closed. You tell me, what's the use of these silly rules? I can't even keep stock at home, wife says that.. ..the children are growing up. forget about me, why are you here? I had come to enquire. Sorry, madam, it's hard to get the booking of.. ..the banquet hall on that day. if you can kindly postpone.. ..the date of your women's organization's meeting. What are you saying? Do you know whom you are talking to? Do you mean to say that Madhab Pakrashi's wife.. ..won't get a booking of the banquet hall? We are trying our best, sir. Okay, let's go together then. Madam, you have waited for long. please wait for some more time. Our manager Marco will be here any moment. Well, I'll wait for some more tome then. You please go back home Mr. Chaterjee. You can live without drinking, one day. You are also saying the same things, you women are all same.. ..don't drink, don't drink. okay, bye. You go straight to suit no. 1, Robertson is already there. I have made Robertson sign in the register. Reception, yes, sir, yes, sir. I'll send him right now. thank you sir. Okay. Shankar. - Yes. Go, Marco is calling you. Shankar, will you kindly do me a favor please? Of course, sir. Will you please go to Byron. Yes, sir, do I have to tell him anything? If you meet Mr. Byron then tell him.. ..that Mr. Marco Polo is impatient. And how long will Mr. Marco Polo have to wait? Okay, sir. Good morning, reception. Yes, sir, yes, sir. It will be done, sir, Right, thank you. SATA. - Yes. Mr. Robertson of suit no. 1 has complained. Shall I give this letter to Mr. Marco Polo? Oh! For god's sake, don't do it. if this letter goes to Marco.. ..then our dear Mr. Lelin will have to loose his job, anyway. You don't bother. I'll see to it, okay? Okay. - Who is Mr. Lelin? Our linen department in-charge. Natahari babu. I mean Nitya Hari Bhattacharya. he is impossible. If this complaint reaches to Marco Polo then he'll punish him severely. Robertson has complained that last night there was.. ..shortage of pillow in suit no. 1. Anyway, since he has complained.. ..we must enquire about this. you go to Mr. Bhattacharya. I? - Why? Won't you be able to do this? Take this, no, let it be. How dare he? It's been 30 years that I am handling.. ..this linen department, I have kept accounts of the bed sheets.. ..and pillow covers of the lords. they haven't said anything to me. And today there is a complaint against me..? No, customer has complained that last night.. ..there was shortage of pillow in suit no. 1. Impossible. Wait, where are you going? shortage of pillow. Suit no. 1. Nitya Hari Bhattacharya hasn't gone crazy that he'll keep.. ..less pillows in a special suit, let's go. Where? - Let's go, how dare you? You have come to prove.. ..Nitya Hari Bhattacharya wrong. I remember the number of pillows.. ..and bed covers given in every room of this hotel. And you are saying that there was shortage of pillow. Definitely they were intoxicated and were playing on the floor. But yesterday was a dry day. That doesn't mean that whole Kolkata city turns dry on a dry day. Impossible, impossible. Did you see this? My job is narrowly saved. No one would believe that I gave them pillows and they soiled those pillows. When this middle aged ladies fall in life.. ..they remain in trance throughout.. ..these guys not only.. ..threw away the pillows, but also complained against Natahari. Is this some kind of a joke? You are right. okay, I am going then. Wait, please pour some water on my hands. But what will you do with water? I'll have wash off the sins. take out the soap from my pocket. What? - There is a soap in my pocket. Do you always keep a piece of soap in your pocket? What else will I do? God knows when I'll have to wash my hands.. ..after handling pillows, that's why I keep soap in my pocket. Let's go to the bath room.. ..actually I don't touch anything in bath rooms. Come. - Let's go. You know what? Thousands and millions of sins are being.. ..generated every moment in hotels and bars. How long are you working over here? Just a few days. Did you get introduced to Rosy? I know her, but I am not well acquainted with her. You know what? I couldn't understand two people in this hotel. One is your SATA Bose, he keeps 100 meters distance from women. And the other is our manager, Mr. Marco, he is a very jolly person. He gets fully drunk. But he never crosses his limits. My dear friends, after a long period of time people will discuss.. ..about some important problem in this banquet, right? Exactly, we'll make such arrangements of banquet.. ..which will increase the prestige of Sahajahan hotel. Will you inform the linen department? - Right, sir. And SATA, you know. will you do the need full. ..because I am in a hurry. - Right away, sir. Huh, these are simple parties. this is no banquet dinner. Don't be sad Mr. Juno, I'll give you the opportunity to show.. ..your culinary skills in my marriage. What? In your marriage? Alright. I'll cook a special dish.. ..of each and every country in your marriage. O gracious lord, may Mr. Juno live long. And send a bride for me as soon as possible from.. ..the united nations. - Well! You are pulling my leg! I'll prepare an amazing soup on your wedding night. I hope all the spices will be available in Kolkata. Sure. I require.. 12 tomatoes.. ..6 onions... - Onions! If I have onion breath on my wedding night, my bride won't come to me. It's better not to get married. Alright, you don't have to get married or to have onions. Go home and have fruits. I don't understand something about you, SATA. Some of the vegetarians here, eat eggs. And there are another bunch of non-vegetarians that don't eat beef. And those, who eat beef, can't eat pork. Tell me, Goddess! What do I do? - What? That's why, great Ram Prasad Thakur had written... Great Ram Prasad Thakur had written... "Tell me, Goddess! Where do I stand?" SATA, was Mr. Prasad a great cook? Very great cook! He used to cook only for the Goddess. Is it true? - True! The country's status is... What can we say about it? Let's not talk about it. Good evening, everyone. - Hello! You are here. Please go in. Can you see that short man with a bald patch on his head? - Hello! He is Mr. Agarwal. Give him special treatment. He has booked our suit no. 2 forever. Forever? Yes, forever, that is his guest house. And do you know Karabi Guha? Yes. Karabi Guha is the hostess of his guest house. Hello Mr. Jokharia, come, come. I hope everything is fine with you. Everything is fine. Tell me. - You've been quite generous. He is Mr. Jokharia. Cotton king. These are the human lovers of Kolkata. All these? Yes, my god! Good evening, Ms. Sanyal. God evening. How are you? - Good. Hope your health is fine. Yes, good, o Mr. Khan. how are you? Shampa Sanyal, society reporter. What is that? These days society journal are being published. Who is throwing parties. who is doing social work. Who is doing scandals. Oh, good evening, SATA. Good evening, Ms. Sanyal. This time, I'll publish your photo in my newspaper. Don't flatter me, Ms Sanyal. I am not feeling like going inside at all. I am feeling like sitting in a room and talking to you. Where is your room? On the terrace, we three of us live in one room, me, Shankar.. ..and one more gentleman, and that gentleman is suffering.. ..from dysentery. he is bed ridden. Ah, poor soul. Don't they give you a separate room? It's all about fate, Ms. Shampa. there is nothing called privacy.. ..in the lives of the hotel staffs like us, did you have to attend.. ..any more parties today?

I need two suits, best suits.. ..I could have arranged for their lodging.. ..in my club, but that will leak out the news, you see. I don't want anyone to know that they are coming. Sorry, sir, foreign cultural mission is coming next week. They have booked all the suits in advance. Then what's the way out? What happened, Mr. Pakrashi? Well, two foreign delegates are coming. So I need two suits. But the situation of the hotels are so bad that if you don't give them.. ..a notice before a month then you won't even get a cot. It's not possible that you won't get a suit when I am there. We have our permanent guest house in Sahajahan. Really? - Yes, Mr. Bose, - Yes, sir. Please call our hostess. - Right, sir. Yes, let's go.

No, no, that's not necessary. will you believe that.. ..I have never stayed in a hotel. my mother doesn't like.. ..staying in hotels at all. when I was in Bombay branch.. ..I could easily stay in a hotel.. But my mother made arrangements for my staying in my aunt's place. I hope your mother won't dislike if you have.. ..a cup of coffee in the morning? Even if she dislikes, I am not going to listen. A cup of steaming coffee in the morning isn't a bad idea. Give me a minute. Good morning. room service please. Are you fond of paintings? You are right, I love painting a lot, but I hardy get time to paint.. While I pass by Maidan (ground) in my car and see someone painting.. ..I feel so sad. And I like poetry too. It's wonderful to stay with one's parents but it's like rigorous.. ..imprisonment to work in one's father's office. My mother wanted that I stay abroad for some more time.. ..but father didn't agree.. ..he thinks that it's high time that I should.. ..take responsibilities of his business. How dare I defy him? I have to go to receive the delegates now. Bye, greetings. - Greetings. This is good. Yes, yes, very good. This is wonderful, it is beautiful. - Thank you. I would like to take some photographs.. ..for my family in Germany. Please take. Instead of being a hostess you should be an artist. Mr. Pakrash I am feeling very thirsty. Can I have a glass of beer please? Extremely sorry, Mr. Boot, today is dry day. What? Dry day? Never heard of it. You never know it, anyway. You please take care of them. I'll be back in a while. Will you please? What is this, madam? Daab. Daab? It's a typical Indian drink. come on, have it. Thank you. Thank you. How do you drink? Please demonstrate to them. Okay, I'll show you, like this. Please, try. - Let's try. So, they drank coconut water instead of water, right? Yes, and listen, I have a plan. please manage his brother-in-law.. ..Madhab Pakrashi, and take those German gentlemen to.. ..Mrs. Chakladar's flat. yes, yes. I'll make all arrangements for their drinks. And I'll take the opportunity to do.. ..some ground work with them. And then I can talk about business with them. Do you understand? But Anindya can be a problem. God knows how come Fokla Chaterjee's nephew doesn't drink. Anyway I'll manage this side.. ..you must keep my cash ready. Mother, mother. Anindya. You are here, and I was looking for you all around the house. I am going out. Now? - No other way out. I have to take the German gentleman to the factory. They must be ready by now. I know that it is very mush strenuous for you. But I am very proud to see your sense of duty, Anindya. Take good care of the Germans other wise your father will feel bad. There is no way that they won't be taken care.. ..since Ms. Karabi is handling everything. Miss Karabi? - Yes. The lady who takes care of Mr. Agarwal's guest house. I see, Mr. Agarwal's hostess? You know mother, she is a very nice girl.. ..it's not been long that I know her, but she is so well behaved. And do you know what is her highest qualification. She is an artist by nature, she decorated her room with simple. Anindya, you can praise Mr. Agarwal's hostess later.. You are getting late for the factory. Yes, mother, bye. Mr. Shankar, come in. Max Muller Bhavan has sent this packet to Dr. Rider. So, he gave it to me to keep it in his room. I see. But I can hardly see you these days. No, actually you remain busy with the guests. So, even if I want I can't come to meet you. Why are you standing? Please sit down. Now tell me, how are you? I went home two days back. My younger brother is very sick. So I am very unhappy. I see. My mother has packed some coconut sweets for me. Will you have some? Look, I am a Brahmin, so I have every right to take home food. So, you rather give me, I'll share it with Satada at night. I'll be back in a while. - One more thing. Mr. Anindya was praising you a lot today.. ..in front of Satada. Did he praise me? No, actually he was praising this tasteful decoration of this suit. I see. Did you get introduced to Mr. Anindya? Yes. He is very innocent. I have to go back to the counter. I am getting late. I'll bring it right away. If you don't mind can I ask for your permission for something special? I am the hostess of your friend, Mr. Agarwal, so you don't have to.. ..ask for my permission. you can rather order me. All day long you stay captivated in this room. So I thought that the poetry of my favourite poets might.. ..give you pleasure. How come you are so sure that your favourite poets.. ..will be my favourite too? No, the poets haven't answered this question. But I can very easily answer this question. You can say that it's my speculation. I am a business man, so I am quite good at gambling. If you had served Bengali literature it would have been.. ..good for the country. Wait I can serve Bengali literature later. Let me serve the Germans.. ..first and do good to Madhab industries. Who's that? It's me. Sorry to wake you up. you have to evacuate.. ..your room right now. - Room? Right now? yes, there is some urgency. I'll explain to you later. You do one thing. do have a change. Take your costume and go to the wash room, please. Please come through, please.. ..this room will do for this night, I think. Ah, this is fine, fine. But you have arranged this room for us. But what about Ms. Mitra? Please don't worry about that. I'll do something. Okay, sir, thanks a lot. Thank you, good night. Good night. Good night. Come. Please, give that to me. It's alright. I am feeling so bad. What will you do? Please spend the night somehow, come. Come in. Whose room am I occupying? You can find that out later. now go to bed. But if I don't come to know that whose room is this.. ..I won't be able to sleep at all. It belongs to Mr. SATA Bose. What Bose? - Earlier I was Satya Sunder Bose. But now I have become SATA Bose. But why did you do this? We are flying again tomorrow early morning. I could have spend the rest of the time in the lounge. I think I am unnecessarily disturbing you. I am feeling very bad. where will you sleep now? There is no question of my sleeping, I am on duty now. And his duty hours will also start after some time, right? Err, yes. How can I thank you? - Greetings. Let's go. The lady is an air hostess. Sujata Mitra.. ..their flight was cancelled due to some technical problem. So they came directly over here. Let's go. Normally we have separate arrangements for pilots.. ..and flight attendants, but today the situation is very bad. None of the rooms are empty, I don't have the right to wake up.. ..anyone other than you. so I had to wake you up. Let's go. Where are you going early in the morning? Hey! Take care of that! I'm going to the Goddess. I work in the dirt all the time. Yet, I'm fit and fine, all thanks to the goddess. I go and clean the idols of the deities every day. It doesn't matter how much dirt I have to deal with every day. It is no use talking to you, sir. You are an educated man. Please allow this boy, who is a brahmin. If he goes bathes in River Ganga every day, his sins will be cleared. I am not stopping him. He may go if he wants to. You may go alone. - Right. You will never listen to a poor man until it's too late. Goddess! He is totally crazy. After bathing in the river, he sprinkles holy water in the hotel. I can't say anything, he is quite old. It's almost 4:30 am. Call Sujata Mitra and the professor. They have a morning flight. Oh, it's you! Come in. Welcome. Were you reading poems? - Yes. Don't you think they are amazing? You know, I can find myself in some of the poems. That's true. Poems portray our feelings. I've been talking about business all day. I've been trying to explain the Germans.. ..that if they don't have a treaty with us, they'll be doomed. Where are they now? - German Consulate. So, I decided to inform you in person. Please be comfortable. I'll get some tea. No! Please don't bother. I'm tired after maintaining business formalities all day. I want to go to the river bank. You know.. ..I love to watch the sunset at the river bank. Why are you laughing? I get it! You're wondering why I'm not married if I am such a romantic! Let's have a seat. Hello. How are you? - Hello. Where is your mentor, Mr. Sata Bose? He has night duty. I see. I need your help. Tell me. I want information about the German clients. How would I help you in this matter? You can. You can do a lot of things. Please connect me to Ms Guha. If she is interested, she may help me get rich. Okay. - Thank you. Room 202, please. Hello, Ms Guha? You have a chance to become famous. A journalist wants to meet you. A hostess needs to stay in background. Anindya will talk to the press. What did you say? I don't understand the matter. No, you don't need to ask him to sit. Send him upstairs. Okay. A press reporter wants to meet you. But my parents don't met anyone without PRO involvement. Tell him that I'm busy. But... - Please ask him.. ..to contact my PRO. But I called him upstairs. Oh no! Is that so? Anindya has recently joined the industry. He loves Bangladesh. Its fate depends on Indian and German industrial collaboration. Correct. Once this thermal power factory starts.. ..we'll be able to provide jobs to many. If you write about these German guests, I mean.. ..if you write well.. ..it'll help them, too. I'll try my best. - Thank you so much. Haven't I told you before that someday Anindya will glorify.. ..your business? I am surprised to think. How did Anindya do such wonderful publicity? But I am not surprised at all. After all I have brought him up in my way. I gave him the best education. being a father.. ..what you couldn't do. I did it being a mother. So Anindya's entire credit belongs to me today. Madhab industries took away entire credit.. and what did you do? But why are you getting impatient? What are you saying? Why won't I be impatient? I had to spend so much money to please those Germans. And today.. - Do you think that I am sitting idle? I am not talking about that, Fokla.. ..today morning I saw the news.. And you have lost all trust on me, right? Look, Mr. Agarwal.. - Yes. This Fokla Chaterjee is a very cautious batsman. Two bumper balls can't do anything to fail his nerves. Let them throw bumper balls. I don't care. Well. If the Pakrashis are smart then this Fokla Chaterjee is smarter. Do you know why have I come here? - No. The lady who has helped me to do this publicity. To thank her, right? Don't think me so fake. I haven't come just to say a 'thank you'. Forget all that, my guests must be disturbing you a lot. Not at all, they are not disturbing me at all. They are happy with themselves. I can't see them, where are they? They have gone to the restaurant to have breakfast. Okay, but I have to leave now, I have to take them for sightseeing. I myself had to come, Miss Karabi. The matter is very confidential. Top secret, you have to keep an eye on Mr. rider and Mr. Boot. What is their state of mind? I haven't spoken to them about business. But you have to talk. otherwise what's the point.. ..keeping so beautiful hostess? Make sure there is no problem in taking care of these guests. A lot depends on this money. Karabi, tell me. - Yes? How long does Anindya stay here? Thank you. What's the matter? You could've called me. I couldn't have spoken to you in my room. Shankar, I don't know what to do. I need your advice. What's the matter? The problem is that Agarwal wants information on Madhab Industries.. ..and use it to his benefit. - What do you mean? He wants to meet the Germans without informing anyone. Instead of Parkashis, if the Germans build a factory.. ..with Agarwal, it won't harm them. He wanted to know how long Anindya.. ..stays here. What did you say? - I made up stories. I told him that he stays here.. ..till late every night. I have a feeling that I was caught. You know Fokla Chaterjee! He is providing inside information to Agarwal. - What? He is Anindya's uncle. Insiders are often the worst enemies. Agarwal was giving instructions to him over the phone. He was trying to stop Anindya from coming to the hotel in the evening. He wanted to stop him at any cost.. He asked to use drinks, women.. ..he even asked to use force. But what will Agarwal gain by doing this? The agreement with the Germans will be signed tomorrow. Anindya is representing Madhab Industries. If they could stop him, his entire plan will be ruined. And Agarwal will get what he wants. Oh no! Shankar, what should I do now? You should tell Anindya everything over the phone. I tried to call him at the office, but he wasn't there. I am scared to call him at home. Will you please call him at home? I can get you connected. But you will have to talk to him. - Me? Yes. Do you get it, Ani? My motto is.. ..as long as I am playing, I will hit hard. I won't slow down. Enjoy your life! Sir, you have a call. I'll be right back, uncle. Anindya, I am calling from Sahajahan hotel. Please talk to Ms. Guha. Hello. Can you please immediately come to this hotel. No, I won't be able to come to the hotel today. I have to go out with uncle. Uncle wants to introduce me to a poet. I am going to hear him recite his poetry. Do that some other day. Please come here today right this moment. Please! What are you saying? - I am feeling really lonely. I am very lonely. I want to see you. I want to see you right now. Listen! Hello! Listen! Hello! Uncle, you wait here. I'll be back after some time. But where are you going? Make yourself comfortable. I'll be back in a while, bye. Wait, Anindya. Thank god, you have come. Why did you disconnect the phone suddenly? What's the matter? I am sorry, you had to cancel your poetry listening session. Actually I wanted to see you. Are you telling the truth? I can't believe you. Mr. Anindya. Please forgive me. I am just a ordinary hostess. I shouldn't intrude into your business affair, but somewhere.. ..behind your back. something against you. Against us? Are you talking about some conspiracy? No, I don't know. Mr. Anindya please promise me that you'll be careful.. ..promise me that you won't listen to anybody. You won't go anywhere, let the deal get finalized tomorrow. Then you can go wherever you want. Are you suspecting my uncle? No, please don't ask me anything. I work for somebody else. I am the hostess of Mr. Agarwal. I am nobody to you. "It'll stay near me, it'll always stay near me." "I know that it'll never go away, it'll always stay near me." "This road will go far." "But this moment will never go far away." "The wonderful moments of life are knocking at my heart." "The wonderful moments of life are knocking at my heart." "Everything talks in silence." "So everything talks in silence." "It'll stay near me, it'll always stay near me." "I know that it'll never go away." "This is a new kind of emotional game and I have lost my heart. ..to it's colourful fancy." "This is a new kind of emotional game and I have lost my heart. ..to it's colourful fancy." "The spring will arrive with a smile at the end of this road of ours." "This song, this moment, this light and laughter." "So this song, this moment, this light and this laughter." "All will stay near me, all these will always stay near me." "I know that it'll never go away, it'll always stay near me." "It'll stay near me, it'll always stay near me." Have you seen Anindya? He is with the German guests. I see. Did you anyone call Anindya from here just a while ago? Dr Righter called him. - Sure? I had a feeling that someone was talking to him in Bengali. You are right. I had called him. Dr Righter had asked me to make the connection. I see. Okay. I'll take your leave now. The experts in the hotel business have said.. ..that there should be a counter between your guests and you. Never forget that! What are you thinking? Why did you do this Mr. Anindya. I am an ordinary hostess. You are not ordinary. you are extra ordinary. But you should think one more time before going any further. Karabi, today there is no good or bad for me. Right now I am in such a state of mind.. ..that I am feeling that if I could.. ..do something for you then I would feel very happy. Anindya. Yes, mother. I have something important to discuss with you. With me? Yes, I have hearing something about you since last few days. Initially, I didn't give much importance to it. But now it has taken such a turn that I can't keep quiet any longer. What a shame! I am feeling so ashamed about it. But mother, I haven't done anything which can make you feel ashamed. So you don't think that flirting with a cheap woman is a shameless act! I wanted to say something to you since last few days. But I couldn't tell you, and now since you have raised the issue.. ..let me tell you clearly. I am not flirting with Karabi. I want god for her with all my heart, and I love her. What did you say? You love her? She is a cheap call girl. Don't you hesitant to say that you love her? Before saying that she is cheap have you ever thought.. ..of knowing that what kind of a woman she is? I don't have the slightest intention, whatever I have heard.. ..about her is enough. No, that's not enough.. ..she might have to do that because she has.. ..family burden on her. she is having to bring up.. ..her younger siblings, that doesn't mean that she is a bad woman. I feel so ashamed to see your taste. I didn't expect this kind of words from you, mother. You are a leader of women's welfare society. Your lectures on social reformation are published in the news papers. But I didn't realize that those are said just to get cheap publicity. Shut up, who gave you the right to criticize me? It's you. You have always taught me.. ..to stand for truth and justice, mother. But I have never thought.. .. that I'll have to face you only for truth and justice. I have heard everything, now you listen to one thing very clearly. Otherwise you'll be thrown out of this family. You won't even get a penny from Madhab industries. Okay, then you also listen to one thing very clearly. Today no sacrifice is greater to me for Karabi. Whatever my heart says is good, true and natural. I am going to accept that only. Reception. Good morning, sir. William here. Yes, he is here only, one minute, Shankar, Satada. Shankar speaking. Okay, I am coming right away. William. - Yes. Will you please attend him? Excuses. Sure, you want it in coming month, right? Small, sir? Yes, small will do. Yes, it is available. Come, come. What's the matter? Why have you called me so urgently? Do we have to make any special arrangements for Mrs. Pakrashi? No, the matter is very problematic. You know everything so there is no point hiding from you. I came to know that Anindya wants to marry Karabi. The prince of Madhab industries, is crazily in love with the hostess of.. ..suit no. 2 of Sahajahan hotel. Mrs. Pakrashi thinks that Karabi is trying to blackmail Anindya. She thinks that Karabi had taken advantage of Anindya's innocence.. ..and took him to bed, and now she is asking for her price. Impossible. But how are we getting involved in this? She wants our help. Help? Yes, she wanted us to talk to Karabi about this. But I have said that it's not possible for us. Now she has gone to talk to Karabi, herself. Beware, I won't tolerate the harm brought to.. ..Pakrashi group of industries. Anindya is young and innocent. He doesn't understand, but how can you? Shame on you! You are a woman. don't you have a heart? Now how much money do you want to spare Anindya? Money? Yes, money. And just because I have come to you.. ..don't increase your rate.. ..good if you listen to me. Otherwise I'll ask Mr. Agarwal to throw you out from this place.. ..and not only that. if required I can go further to bring harm to you. And listen. Anindya shouldn't know anything about all these. I am giving you 24 hours time. I hope that you'll be able to.. ..make up your mind within that time. Okay. If someone loves me.. ..and I love him, too.. ..is there anything wrong if I want to marry him? I don't think so. - You don't, do you? But you know.. ..people still won't like it. Why? - What do you think? Agarwal's hostess is getting married.. ..to the heir of the Parkashi empire. Won't people condemn it? But I... I won't be able to live without Anindya. I never had anything in my life. If someone loves me.. ..shouldn't I accept it? Tell me. Shouldn't I? Please tell me why Anindya's mother, Mrs. Parkashi... Please tell me why she is objecting to it! I am taking the responsibility to please her son. Then why does she... Why are you quiet? Please say something. Did you hear that Mrs. Pakrashi threatened me that she would.. ..ask Mr. Agarwal to fire me? You know, when someone tries to threaten me, I lose my head. I can't control my impulses. No one has ever been able to threaten me into doing anything. No one could do that! I... Shankar! Please say something now. We will keep in touch with you. All of you will forget us, won't you? None of you have ever treated me as a colleague at Shahjahan Hotel. You will forget that, too. If you'd come to Shahjahan Hotel for dinner or banquet.. ..you'll go to the hall with special guests. You won't even look at the counter. And we will... We would still be doing registrations and attending calls. We'd be scolded by Stuart. Don't you like working here? - Not at all! Will you help me find a 10-5 job? You will have a lot of jobs at your disposal then. I will do it. You have been such a great friend to me. This is the least I could do for you. Thank you so much. I'll take your leave now. It's very late. You should rest. Okay? Good night. - Good night. What's the matter, Nityaharida? Tell me what's the matter.. ..today the lady of suit no. 2 didn't choose linen. She didn't even scold the florist. I don't know. Don't you have brain in your head? Can't you see anything? How do I know, tell me. She is such a nice girl. There is definitely something wrong. Look, Mr. Shankar, I am working in this Sahajahan hotel.. ..for quite a long time. So I can smell everything beforehand. God hasn't given me any child but don't think that I am heartless. I consider Karabi as my daughter. and if someone tries to.. ..bring harm to her, I won't keep quiet. Why can't you agree? You are a mother, why can't you consider.. ..my problem from a mother's point of view? Shut up! You can't convince me with all those fake emotions of yours. I understand that you are taking advantage of Anindya's weakness.. ..and trying to blackmail me. Black mail? Yes, black mail. Why are you saying all these? I am saying the right thing. now you tell me. How much do I have to pay you? How much money do you want to get out of his life? No, you are taking advantage of my situation and insulting me. It's true that I work as a hostess in order to support my family.. ..and bring up my younger siblings.. ..but I swear on god and my siblings.. ..my love is not fake. Love? How can a prostitute like you love? Prostitute!? Mrs. Pakrashi, can you recognize these? Why are you turning pale? Where did you get those from? Give them back to me. Mrs. Pakrashi, if I show these photographs to your husband, son.. ..daughter, son-in-law and the society then what will happen to you? I feel like laughing to imagine.. ..what will become of your image then. I agree to all what you are saying. I won't create any hindrance in your marriage with Anindya. Just I have one request to make. Please burn those photographs. Shankar, please help me. Please help me! What did I do? What's the matter? Why are you acting that way? My head is splitting! I have a splitting headache. I don't have a family here. I don't have any loved ones here. You are the only one, who'd understand me. Tell me what I can do for you. I have... I've forced Anindya's mother.. ..to give consent to our wedding by showing her.. ..the photos with her boyfriend. Shankar, believe me. I didn't want to get married in this way. I didn't want to get married in this manner. I didn't want to threaten my would-be mother-in-law. I didn't want to take advantage.. ..of this situation to marry Anindya. No! This is impossible! This isn't possible. I won't be able to use such cheap tricks to be a part of his life. This is sinful! This will be bad for Anindya, too. No! Why did that nice girl come to this hotel? You know Mr. Satya Sunder. first time I saw her in this hotel.. ..I had told everybody that she is not the type to become a hostess. She is a decent girl.. ..but nobody believed me that day. Hey. Sir, she used to like light saffron colour a lot. While taking away her dead body please cover her with this. So you have come. Why didn't you come a little earlier? She died consuming sleeping pills. Everything is finished. Ladies and gentlemen, now I present to you, Corrie. Corrie, the woman. Where is Corrie? We want Corrie. Ladies and gentlemen, I went to her room to call her. I saw that she consumed a pill, I think that she took a wrong tablet.. ..and hence this disaster. Hey. I was looking for you only. I want to talk to you in private. Strictly confidential. Come. So, I wanted to ask you... You are a Bengali, right? It's my duty to take care of you. It's my duty to make sure you get some extra income.. ..apart from your salary. What do you mean? I don't get it. He is Mr. Rangnathan. He wants to meet Corrie. Sorry, that is not possible. Listen to me. The problem is.. ..that Mr. Rangnathan is feeling very lonely. So, if you could introduce him to Corrie... He is still immature. He isn't mature enough. It's okay. - Okay. All sinners have flocked over here, huh. What happened? Whom are you angry with now? I thought that after independence the British will pack.. ..cricket and cabaret and go away from this country. But it's just the opposite. the cabaret has increased. What will I tell you, at times, in order to take revenge. I fell like giving every body a huge side pillow. But the foreigners don't use side pillows so they have.. ..named it Natahari pillow. What? - Yes. Natahari pillow? Yes, actually it's not a good habit to get used to side pillows. But if one gets used to it then it will be a disaster. That's what happened to this country. Poor thing! Good evening. You should say good morning. Good morning, captain. - Good morning. How are you? - Fine, thank you. I want a very nice room facing the garden. - Sure, sir. Thank you, sir. - Bell boy! Rooms 329, 335 and 352. Take your seats. - Captain, I'll be there. - Okay. I am feeling very sorry to see your situation. But I haven't slept Ms. Mitra. Poor thing! You are having to talk to me as if I am just a customer. This time I have given you a nice room, Ms. Mitra. Last time when you came at night you must have left with.. ..a bad notion about Sahajahan hotel. Your notion will change this time. I can make out from your face that you haven't.. ..worked in a hotel for long.. ..but how did you learn to talk.. ..so professionally in such a short span of time? SATA Bose is the reason, it is because of him that I learnt.. ..my job within a short span of time. SATA Bose, isn't it a strange name? This hotel of yours doesn't seem to be a safe place at all. - Why? Satya Sundar and SATA are polar opposite names. Be very careful. Soon, your name might also get converted into.. ..something like Shanky, instead of Shankar. I dare people to try and distort my name. I won't spare that person. When did you arrive? - Just now. Hello. How are you? - Fine. He treated you well, didn't he? He is quite good with words. You've trained him well. What do you mean? Last time, you gave me your room. Today, he told me.. ..that he has arranged a better room for me. Yet, you didn't even thank me for giving you my room. I didn't thank you intentionally. Those, who give their rooms to unknown people and stay awake all night.. ..are either idiots or stubborn fools. One doesn't need to thank them. You got the opportunity and you said so many wrong things to me. Idiot! Stubborn fool! Moron... That's just great! You just added moron to the list. I looked for you to thank you, but now I find that it was good that.. ..I didn't find you, there is no point thanking people like you. I am very sorry, I didn't know that you looked for us, sorry. How will you know? All day long you are busy with breakfast, lunch dinner, banquet. When will you get the time to know about other things? Are you going to stay awake all night again? No, today is... Listen, Mr. Marco is missing since morning. What are you saying? - Marco? Our manager. My god! So what are you waiting for? Report to the police. The situation will be more problematic if we inform police. Parabashia is saying that he left with Mr. Byron in the morning. So will you please go to Mr. Byron's house once? I don't know his house. - Of course.. Take a taxi and go. - Sure. I'll do the duty on your behalf. - Okay. Give me the tie. - Oh, yes. Thank you, you go. Shall I go along with him? No, you may go. May I say something? You should take our car from the airlines. I'll inform the driver. I hope it won't cause you a problem. - Not at all. Please come with me. Go on. - Okay. Let me go. I am telling you, stop it. - Come on. It's alright. Why do you stay awake all night? It doesn't make any sense. Absolutely useless, when the world sleeps, you should sleep also. Good night, good night, madam, good night. Let me go. I felt like telling your manager that it's dawn now. But his life is still full of darkness of night. poor soul. I feel very sad for him. Bose da. - Oh, you have come back. You had to be harassed for nothing, Marco has come back. I am very sorry. Marco has come back. Has he? Yes, here is your tie. and your duty, okay? Ms. Mitra, I must tank you a lot.. ..but I have no words to do that. Do you understand? Manage your mentor now. he doesn't have words now. You just think, you gave us your car, you gave me company. You stayed awake till late night, no. I shouldn't allow you to suffer any more. Why are you talking my luggage? Look at him, he is frowning at me. I shouldn't allow you that means he is not being able to.. ..tolerate the fact that a lady will carry her bag.. ..when a healthy coolie like me is present. Am I correct, young man? Let's go. Ms Mitra has quite nice things to say about you. Last night she was praising you a lot. She is very innocent. Yes, I have seen many air hostesses in my hotel job. I wonder how does an innocent girl like her entertain passengers? Few people have it in their nature, they can't get rid of it.. ..even if they try hard. - Yes. Can I come in? Come in. Come in, you will have a long life. - Why? Satada was just now talking about you. Is it? Why are you standing? Please sit down. I'll go now. Why? I have come and you are going away, not good. You also sit down, let's chat for sometime, why will you go? Yes, you sit down, I don't trust your mentor. He might just start praising Sahajahan hotel right now. I see. The staff of the hotel get so much benefits. I am feeling jealous. All that glitter is not gold! You have said right. I mistook bronze for gold. And hence this is my situation. If you say it little clearly it'll be easier for us to understand. We'll have to go to flash back then. 12 years back. Sujata Mitra and her father. Had to take a flight from Bombay to Kolkata.. ..since they didn't get reservation in train. Is your house in Bombay? Yes, my father has a house in Bombay. Don't spoil the flow of the story. - Yes, I am sorry. Yes. So while flying in the vast sky Sujata Mitra saw the pilot.. ..in the cockpit and liked him very much.. ..she decided to be a pilot when she grows up. Excuse me, was the pilot very handsome? Yes, please keep quiet now. you know. Mr. Shankar.. ..I told my father that I want to be a pilot. Your father definitely got annoyed about it. Exactly the opposite, my father assured me.. ..and told me to study well.. ..and he also promised me that he'll help me to be a pilot when I grow up. Are you the only child of your parents? Yes, the only child. But Mr. Shankar, my fate didn't allow me to.. ..become a pilot, I was bad at mathematics. I missed the opportunity to become the first woman pilot of Bengal. Isn't it tragic? I wanted to be a pilot but became an air hostess. One of my uncle also wanted to be a police superintendent.. ..but ultimately he became an office superintendent. How do you work as a receptionist with this kind of.. ..quarrelsome behaviour? So you are blaming me, do you know if I was born in England.. ..I would have become the manager of Claries'. And if I was born in America then. Why aren't you saying anything to support me? It'd your fault, bro, you interrupt a lot when other people talk. Thou too Brutus! You got convinced by the sweet talks of an air hostess.. ..and betrayed a trustworthy friend like me. Come in. What's the news, Guruberia? Sir, the manager asked you to meet him after dinner. Okay. What? Do you want to say anything? You carry on talking. I should go now. No, no, you please sit. Guruberia, you can talk about the most secret thing of this world.. ..in front of three of us. Parabashia has agreed to get his daughter married to me. Wonderful! So you have done it. it is a memorable day.. ..for the people of the terrace. young Guruberia's oldest desire.. ..is going to get fulfilled, so now you become patient and put.. ..great effort in work. you will win. But that's the problem, sir, the manager is not ready to sanction.. ..leave for me and Parabashia at the same time. If you can talk to the manager and arrange for the. Sir, you know everything, if it gets late then Parabashia might.. ..get his daughter married to someone else. Poor thing! You'll get he days off. Start shopping for your wedding. Listen, if you want anything, let me know now. Don't be shy. If I could get a cake from Shahjahan on my wedding... Of course. I'll ask Jhunu to prepare a one and a half kg cake for your wedding. Your name will be written on it. Do one thing. Take Shankar along.. ..and write a leave application. What happened? What are you doing? Don't do that, get up. Come. - Go now.. - I'll be right back. You love Guruberia a lot, right? All the world of the love. "Remember this incident, my dear." "Remember in your laughter and games." "Remember this incident, my dear." "Remember in your laughter and games." "Remember this incident, my dear." "Remember the song I had sung." "Remember the song I had sung when the leaves. ..were falling from the trees." "Remember this incident, my dear." "Remember that I had sung a song in the lonely forest with inattention. ..and disrespect." "Remember the song I had sung." "Remember the song I had sung when the leaves. ..were falling from the trees." "Remember this incident, my dear." "O traveller of the day, remember that I was walking in the evening. ..with a lamp in my hand." "Remember that when someone called me from the other bank. ..then I had travelled in a broken raft and sang." "Remember the song I had sung." "Remember the song I had sung when the leaves. ..were falling from the trees." "Remember this incident, my dear." "Remember in your laughter and games." "Remember this incident, my dear." How long are you working in hotel? Almost 12 years, now I can't think of anything other than that. Don't you ever go home? No, moreover I don't have anyone else other than my step mother. I think she is not at all bothered about her romantic son's future. What's the point blaming her? She is not much older to me. She herself is bothered about her own future, anyway, forget that. When are you coming next? I have already taken leave for few days because I want to disturb you. Wonderful! I feel jealous about you. Quiet natural, either I am in a hotel or I am flying. When everybody else are fast asleep then I travel to a hotel.. ..from an airport, today in one hotel, tomorrow in the other.. ..day after tomorrow probably in some other. That's why they say.. ..for the sweetness of life is variety. You remain so busy all day long. when do you get time to study? That's the only friend of mine in my lonely life. What's the matter? Why did SATA Bose take a leave from the manager? He never went out of the hotel in these 12 years. What has happened to him? But why are you asking me? how will I know? Use your brain at times. everything will be clear to you. I am finding the situation to be very complicated. You can never suppress smoke, money and love. It'll definitely come out. I wish I had a scooter. Let's go. I have done something, but if you scold me for that.. ..then I'll be very unhappy. All human beings makes mistakes. but why should I scold you? Take this, you'll get your scooter within 2 days. What kind of childishness is this? What will I do with a scooter? And where will I keep it? This is such a big hotel, so many expensive cars are parked over here. So I don't believe that you won't find place to park your scooter. But I. Will you hold this? Please don't say no.. ..you can go out of this hotel.. ..at times and enjoy the sense of freedom under the vast sky. Do you understand? Hey, Shankar, come, come. Did you hear the news? Why are you standing? Pull that chair and sit with us. Thank you, sir, but we don't have the rule to sit with the customers. No rule? Forget it, from now on.. ..all rules will be made by me and. I see. Mr. Agarwal, my friend.. ..he has bought 50% share of Shajahan hotel. And I have become the director of this hotel. I have never adopted any unfair means, just by the help of.. ..my honest labour I have reached here today. This Fokla Chaterjee is an example now. Sure, I have never seen any one in my life of your calibre. Do you mean it? - Yes, sir. Jimmy. - Yes, sir. We have decided to keep European management. Everything should be ultra modern. You are right, Mr. Chaterjee, absolutely right. Jimmy. - Yes, sir. I have decided to make you the manager. Thank you, sir. Thank you. We won't intrude in your everyday work.. ..but Mr. Agarwal want. In fact I also wants you to bring attractive girls.. ..and make this place an Eden garden.. ..which will be filled with song, dance and happiness. Yes, sir. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir. Shankar. - Yes? I want your opinion about something. Tell me. Now I have to choose between my job and Sujata. What does that mean? If I want to choose Sujata. Then I won't be able to continue my job with Shajahan. Why? Because air hostesses loose their job after marriage. - I see. And whatever salary I get.. ..we won't be able to find even 1/2 a room in Kolkata. Sujata however has arranged a good job for me in Bombay. That's really good. you should go then. I can't think myself away from Shajahan. The job has so much of romance in every moment. Where else will I get it? Right. But still I should say, bro that you should go. Because when the greatest moment of life has come.. ..you must accept it. even if it has come so late. Alright, gentleman. I'll not stand in your way. I am accepting your resignation. Burn all the bridges lying behind and try to go ahead. If you like, you can come with me to the.. ..African gold coast. if I get efficient worker like you over there.. ..then I'll get the courage to build a new hotel again. God bless you, young man. Thank you, sir. Sujatadi, I am really feeling bad about it. But one day I'll be able to overcome my sorrows. Probably that day you won't remember me or SATA. You'll sit on this terrace of Sahajahan and talk to new people. Yes, I'll tell people how a woman.. ..rejuvenated the life of a man. Anyway! I heard that you have arranged for a job for Satada in Bombay.. ..but have you finished judging each other? I don't believe in haste. Have you informed your family? I don't have whatever you call a family. Like SATA I also don't have anyone. Sujatadi you might not have anyone.. ..but I am there for you two. What happened? - I am thinking. It takes so much time to build something.. ..but it takes only a moment to break it. I had collected so much treasure from Sahajahan bit by bit. Today everything ended with just a stroke of a pen. Look here. Very good, it's an wonderful arrangement. Parabashia, how did you do so much in such a short time? Everybody helped so we did it somehow. You all don't show so much enthusiasm in your job. Sir, SATA sir is going away. he helped us so much. Even one's own family members also don't do so much. You are right, Parabashia, Mr. Marco has left. And now Mr. Satya Sunder is also going. Everyone will understand now. Come, come. My God! What all have you done. this is a grand arrangement! Oh let it be. - No, sir. You put it around your neck. Hope everything is fine at your home. Yes, sir. Bring your wife to Kolkata. won't she feel bad alone? Satada. - Yes. Come and sit. - Yes, let's go. Mr. Satya Sunder, I am an ordinary man. I don't have anything to offer you. So I have made this flower for you out of napkin. Mr. Nityahari, you are eldest of all.. ..you are like a big brother to everybody. Please take care of everybody. - Of course I will. Sir, we are poor people, we have something very small. Why did you do this? Why did you unnecessarily spend money? Good evening, gentlemen, I am extremely sorry for being late. SATA. I myself have cooked your favourite dishes today. Please eat properly. What's the matter? Why have you discarded me? Why haven't you all call me? Everyone wanted some music, but no one had the courage to call you. I see, thank you. I have composed a music piece in the honour.. ..of Mr. SATA Bose during the last three days. I have named it 'farewell'. Farewell to our beloved SATA Bose. Bye, let it be, god bless you. Bye. Why are you standing alone in the darkness? No, I mean. I understand, you must be feeling bad for Mr. Bose. I feeling very helpless since Bose da has gone. No one in this world stays for ever, except god you can't.. ..depend on anybody forever. are you feeling sad? You can come to my concert in Mumtaz, today is my last concert. What does that mean. Te management is not liking me. Jimmy and Chaterjee have told me.. ..that I must give them cheerful music or I quit. I have decided to quit. I must go now, I must get ready for the last concert. Sir, Mr. Jimmy has summoned you in his office. You go, I am coming. Okay, sir. I am extremely sorry to disturb you. I had to summon you at this hour. It's alright, sir. What can I do for you, sir? I am very sorry, Shankar.. ..we don't need you from next month. You may go, good luck. I found that you were given temporary appointment. That means you are not entitled for salary of even a month.. ..but I don't believe in ancient oppression system. So we are giving you one month's salary extra. So good night. Jimmy, I'll be at Mumtaz. Yes, sir. I am very sorry, Shankar, please believe me. While typing this letter I had requested Jimmy not to do this. I tried my best. What can you do, Rosy? I was jobless for quite a long period of time. so I know how painful it is not to have a job. Bye, Rosy, thanks a lot. Best of luck, Shankar. Thank you. How come you are still awake? I have been using the day as night.. ..so my habit has changed. I can't sleep. So, I spend my nights with the stars. It's an amazing feeling. Mr. Gomez. You think a lot. Can you tell me why we have suspense in our lives? Why do we always worry about unexpected changes? Can you tell me? I've heard that Hindu scriptures have answers to these questions. But I am an uneducated Christian man. I have no idea. I can answer you through a song. It's an ordinary movie song. I've found my life philosophy through this song. "Que sera sera.." What is the meaning? It means that whatever is supposed to happen will happen. It's not our job to find what's in store for us in future. "Que sera sera." "Whatever will be, will be." "The future's.." "..not ours, to see." "Que sera sera." "What will be, will be." Close your eyes. - But why? Don't ask, just close your eyes. - But what's the matter? You'll come to know gradually. close your eyes now, come with me. Beautiful. Now I understand why you had kept me.. ..away from this flat till today. and why you used to read books of.. ..interior decoration hiding away from me. Yes, sir, just to give you a surprise. Now come this side. This is your study. Beautiful! I have collected these books. I hope you'll like it. Of course. No, not now. let's go to that side.. ..this is our bed room. According to Mr. Nityahari this is the most important centre of life. What does that mean? This the place where we are born. this is the place where we die. This is the place where we fight and this the place.. ..where we make love. Leave me now. Wonderful! It's lovely this balcony of your house is most coveted. I can spend hours and hours of time sitting over here. Is it only my house? Isn't it ours? It hasn't become ours yet. let us make our relation legal. Let's throw a party and then we can call it ours. You'll always defeat me with your words, so I don't even try to win. Now let's go. Where? To the airport, it's time for my flight. Won't you take me to the airport? Certainly. You know what? Suddenly I am feeling sad. But why? It's my last flight, after this I won't need to travel with.. ..my bag from one airport to the other. It's the end of my vagabond life. Look, everybody has to go through this. Everybody feels the same. when I left Sahajahan hotel.. ..my state of mind was also the same. But believe me, to day I don't regret. I know that. Take the key of the flat. Why? Suddenly? From now onwards every responsibility is yours. You have to take all the responsibilities.. ..of my happiness and sorrows, good and bad. Take it. Please fasten your seat belts. May you have a happy journey! Thank you. Why are you crying? No, sir. Gradually, all of you are leaving. So, I am... Let's go, sir. Letter for you, sir. 'Dear Shankar, few minutes I have thrown away the remains of.. ..your Sujatadi's dead body in Arabian sea. Sujata died in a dreadful plane crash. All my memories seem to be everlasting dreams to me. I really wonder that there were so many people in this world.. ..but Sujata has chosen me and loved me. It's not possible for me to live alone over here. So I am going to Africa, I'll join the hotel that Mr. Marco.. ..has built on the gold coast of Africa. But I want to say you something. I may not get the opportunity to tell this to you.. ..ever if I don't say it today. Sujata had high ideas about you. She had said that you are an exceptional person. "Remember the song I had sung." "Remember the song I had sung when the leaves.. ..were falling from the trees." "Remember this incident, my dear."
