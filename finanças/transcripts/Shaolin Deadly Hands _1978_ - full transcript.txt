(exciting music) (crowd commotion) Where you going? That's a very heavy load you got there. (commotion) What's a pretty girl like you doing with these lowlifes? (zinging) (laughing) (slapping) Hey! What'd I do wrong? Excuse me. (exciting music) You want something? Not at all. Which way is it to the Nanhou triad? So you're one of them? Not yet. I gotta get some work. Maybe they'll take me up. That's pretty dangerous. If you're not careful you'll be brigands. (flute whistling) That's very impressive. I got nothing to do. How about we go together? Thanks. (exciting music) You're very kind. I'm from the country. First time here. Just think, so many people. Okay, let's go. (exciting music) (groaning) God damn! (chuckling) You go straight there, passed the city gates and go over a small hill. Then you're there. I'll leave you here. Thank you. Thank you. What the hell you think you're doing? Oh, I'm sorry. - [Woman] Help! Help! - [Man] Commander, please. Please, please, please, [Woman] Let me go! Go on! Just give me time. - You signed the contract. - This girl is for sale. You sell your own girl. No. (thudding) (groaning) Who are you? A traveler. We are Shing Lee's people. You better watch your step. If I don't, what then? You let them go. For an idiot like you? (yelling) (thudding) (groaning) (thudding) Hi-yah! (groaning) (gasping) Leave the contract here and clear off. Let's go! Yeah, okay. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you! How can I thank you? (exciting music) (bar commotion) (somber music) Gotcha. (laughing) (dominoes clicking) You see that? Young man. He's done pretty well for one day. Why doesn't he quit while he's ahead? (chuckling) You're joking. There's 200 silver tails, add another 200. (somber music) (dominoes clicking) [Banker] Eight part. [Men] Eight part? (commotion) - [Male Player] What? - He's gonna beat nine? [Dealer] Nine part. (whizzing) (men yelling) He's cheating! What you say? (thudding) [Man] There's a fight! There's going to be a fight. (crashing) (yelling) (slapping) (thudding) (gasping) Even the place you live belongs to us. Our boss lets you stay on, yet you have the guts to cheat here? Everyone saw it. The banker cheated. Get out! (yelling) (crowd commotion) (thudding) Hi-yah! (tearing) (thudding) (yelling) (boinging) (exciting music) (foreboding music) (groaning) (snapping) I saw it all. The banker was cheating. This time, you win then. But I won 260 though. (chuckling) I have to go on play. I need a thousand tails. Right. Not them. I play with you. Can you pay up? (chuckling) (dominoes clicking) (chiming music) (men whispering) (intense music) You've lost. Looks like you must really need this money. But still, nevermind. Need money? Just borrow it from me. (somber music) (bystanders whispering) So you've really become somebody. (ominous music) Pien. (laughing) Luck-good wind had blown you here. Come, sit down. (chuckling) Some tea. Yes, master, at once. Brother, it's been a long time, right? Made lots of money. Help yourself. You'll like it. That's great. (crackling) Eagle's claw, huh? These things. I don't display in public, but still... I am thinking of looking around here for a little while. Good. Very good. However long you want to stay, you can stay. You want a girl? (laughing) Look over my stable. Choose one. (chuckling) Not changed much, have you? But still, there's more silver around the place. (laughing) Brother, I think you'll get rich very quickly here. (laughing) (somber music) Lin-Chin? Lin-Chin, this is your favorite dish. That right? (somber music) It's not exactly the best restaurant, but we're together. (giggling) Give it me. (foreboding music) Beating you? (whimpering) (dramatic music) [Man] Here comes the grub! (men laughing) (upbeat music) Well, Master Yow. We haven't received you as properly as we should. So, got it? (somber singing music) What's this? Lin-Chin's purchase money. (laughing) I told you before. Lin-Chin's contract costs a thousand. This lot wouldn't have you buy anything. What do you want? A share in her little finger then? Mistress Wan, give her to me. I'll pay you, but it'll take time. Rubbish. You couldn't pay. Just because of you, Lin can't receive visitors. You can't. You be careful. You could never pay for a girl like this. You filthy bitch! She's only 16 and has to take men. She that old? I was only 12. (ominous music) All right, wanna fight? (tapping) Her protection, then, doesn't use layabouts. I know that. I'm a Kung Fu expert. Oh really? At what level? Bonchon. Never heard of that. Vice President, just look at the letter. It's for the President. Why should I look at it? Until the President returns, I can't decide. Wait until he comes back and then we'll see. The President, when does he get back? Well maybe three months, perhaps. When I came here I had some money. It's all been stolen. Mr. Vice President, will you allow me to stay here? I'll do anything, really. No I won't. Vice President, this is a big place. One more person won't make a difference. You fool! This is an important place. Thousands of tails come and go every day. You come, a total stranger? Who knows anything about you? Who's responsible? (intense music) Goodbye. Goodbye. (ominous music) (children giggling) (groaning) Mister, are you awake? Teach us Kung Fu. Teacher, please teach us. What's the use of Kung Fu? Look at me. Today's breakfast, I don't even know where it's coming from. Teacher, look. (chiming music) (upbeat music) (giggling) (laughing) Watch carefully. (whooshing) (exhaling) (ominous music) Funny. Such promising Kung Fu and he wants to be a pickpocket. Kung Fu is good, but it doesn't feed you. And neither... does picking people's pockets. [Yow] I'm not really a thief. It's only enough to buy dog's food. You try and call me a dog? [Yow] No, I didn't mean that. Did you find the Nanhou? (somber music) The President's away. Vice President doesn't want to see me. That money you took. Give me half. (somber music) All gone? Hey, I need more money. Borrow some. We can go betting. (crickets chirping) (chiming music) (horse neighing) (groaning) You weren't asleep. Don't trust me? You want my gold tooth. Fine friend you are. (silly music) Manager, another plate of noodles. Very good. Coming up sir. Here. (ominous music) (groaning) (silly music) (whooshing) This place isn't bad. We'll tidy it up a bit. It should be fine. Who wants to learn Kung Fu? Lousy bastard. He runs the brothel and casino. Like god damn mountains. My teacher. Poor guy. They got him betting there. He lost his property, his life and his daughter. Those hoods. They've tried to take this house and several times. They said, I'd give them nothing if it comes to the worst. I'd lose a dog's life, but that poor girl. What girl? Keep out of this! (dramatic music) Master? Brother Yang is a Kung Fu champion. He could demonstrate. He is very good. (chuckling) I still can't see anything so special. I want to use brother Yang to demonstrate. If it pleases you, give him my position as well, for all I care. How about a little contest first? About a hundred moon's face, than have this society make a bad choice. (laughing) Ho-Chi, don't be so serious. I don't dare. Pain hurts. Must be brave. How can we have a demonstrator who doesn't dare? (ominous music) (dramatic music) Close the doors. [Guards] Yes sir. Any more advice? (intense music) (groaning) (crashing) (slapping) (chuckling) (hand cracking) (thudding) (fluttering) (yelling) (metal clinking) (ominous music) (slicing) (chiming music) (thudding) Brother Chi. Chi-Yow. What are you doing? Get out of my way! His skill is proved and obvious. Can't go on. That little scratch on the hand. You bastard. Draw a knife and fight foul. Damn. What is this? You shut up. He's my friend. Huh? If he's qualified as a demonstrator then we're finished. Brother Chi. You. (stammering) (groaning) I do hope you don't mind. This is disgraceful. Please join us as an ordinary member. I just want a place to stay. Sir, this is my brother, Yow. Oh? Master Wan's pupil. Yes. I have a great respect for his name. A sad loss. (dramatic music) Would you like to join us, brother? (laughing) (upbeat music) (groaning) You bastards giving up? Now push! What's the matter, huh? You! Hey there! A demonstrator has his pride and this is his work. Huh? A principal's duty is to guard the goods. Common hands must do common labor. Now you just let him push. Come on! Let's go. (upbeat music) (whooping) (foreboding music) We're from the Nanhou security group. May we ask whose friends you might be? Nobody's friends. Now leave your goods and clear off. Hey, you can't treat him like that. That won't do. The principal's duty is to guard the goods. Is that right? (silly music) Who are you? A common hand. Just what is a common hand? (intense music) We don't kill laborers, so relax. Just stand back. Oh, thank you. (yelling) (thudding) (groaning) (thudding) What are you playing at? Me? I'm a common hand. (yelling and groaning) (thudding) (slashing) (fluttering) (thudding) (cracking) (horse neighing) (thudding) (groaning) (whimpering) (groaning) (cracking) (groaning) (silly music) (exciting music) (men moaning) (giggling) (men laughing) On this trip we're all in debt to brothers Yang and Yow and to the safe delivery of our assignment I drink to both of them. Mr. President, we've only done our duty. When you say things like this we're both embarrassed. (applauding and cheering) From this moment, Yang is promoted and Yow is Vice President! (men cheering) Mr. President, now that Yow's seniority is greater than mine, it'll be better for him to have this promotion. No, brother Yang. How can my Kung Fu be compared to yours? Now you two, no argument. We need you both. Brother Yow, you have no objection to this, have you? No, indeed. Master Yang, here's to you. Come, I drink to you. Hey, we're all set. We're both brothers. Come, cheers. [Man] Gentlemen, drink with the principals! (cheering) (foreboding music) Master. (ominous music) Our first time together should have gone better. I never thought those two could have wrecked the plan. Did you let them find out our secret somehow? Never. From now on, those devils will have a hard time! In this enterprise, we're our six men. Our main business is a long way in front of us. [Man] Mr. Chang, General Woo's 60th birthday is next month. You know that, of course. [Chang] Yes, I know. [Man] This present here. Your excellency may rest assured. Official gifts are relayed with elaborate precautions. Last year was just a birthday, but this year, the 60th, there's a very bigg difference, you know. Yes, I understand that. (somber music) Can you calculate just how much these are worth? In the whole of my life, I have never laid eyes on such pearls. Perhaps, 500 thousand silver tails? Your eyes are good. President Chang, can I entrust this business to you? Well, my lord, with such a valuable gift why not ask someone to help from the court? (laughing) Good question. Just because it is so valuable. With such a fine gift, best not to let too many people know about it. Actually, in court there is no one to be trusted. President Chang, (laughing) in view of all the circumstances, I must call on your good services here. I wouldn't presume. Come now. What is it that you're thinking? The General's birthday, everyone knows this. For safety sake, we will keep the matter secret. What do you think of that idea? Good, do as you wish. Thank you, your excellency. (foreboding music) Goodbye. Goodbye. (menacing music) General Woo's birthday present. When will it travel? I don't know, but it's worth half a million. (chuckling) Good. You go back. And who knows. Contact me. (foreboding music) Master, before I go, how do we share? Woo Chang, you tell him. (laughing) Three ways, do you agree? That's right. Good. Good. (laughing) Thank you! Thank you! If Chang takes Yang and Yow together, do you have a plan? What? No, I'll fix that. You go and do your job. Sure. Sure (laughing) Brother Chang. (ominous music) (people laughing) Master Pien. You must be Madame Wan. Shall we go upstairs? Have a chat? If you'd like to. (clinking) (somber music) My god. (chiming music) (giggling) What they all say. It's quite true. When a man sees you, he's lust. He can't escape. But why should he? He'll like it. (laughing) Perfect. I have a proposition. Interested? You have here a young lady called Lin Chin. Oh. So Master Pien likes young girls? But this girl is quite a problem. Every day she dreams that Yow Cha Fang will bring the money to buy her out. She'll have no men. Right. So now you force her. If she doesn't like it, beat her... until she does. She must give in. But if she does have men, Yow will go mad. (laughing) That's just what we want. Drive him mad. (foreboding music) (slapping) (groaning) (crunching) (moaning) Chow Yow! (thudding) Good work. Mr. President. Mr. President. Do you have something for us to do? No, but I have something I have to do in town. Would you like to come with me and look around? (upbeat music) Lin Chin? Lin Chin? Lin Chin?! (ominous music) Lin Chin! Lin Chin! Lin Chin! Lin Chin! (somber music) (whimpering) Why did you save me? (crying) Why did you do this? In two days I must work. Men will come to me. You must let me kill myself. Lin Chin. Lin Chin. Lin Chin. You've done your best for me. A thousand is so much money. I will never let anyone touch me. He can't save you. (whip cracking) (intense music) (gasping) Let her go. Don't! Don't! You dare hurt her. Why shouldn't I dare? As long as she doesn't die, she's my property. Even the magistrate gives me that right. If you don't want her here, then get the money. (ominous music) (whimpering) I will find the money. And when? Tomorrow. (intense music) Brother! Hey! (men yelling) (dramatic music) Brother? What's wrong? Brother, you must give me some money. But why? We are friends. Oh, sure. Didn't you say your money, I could use it? You don't need to borrow it. Take anything. But not for gambling. Not that. I can win. Win a thousand tails. Where? (foreboding music) Yesterday I nearly made it. If only I had money. There'd be a chance. Elder brother, I beg you. Lend of me. Elder brother, I beg you. Please lend me money! No way! You really won't? No. Really? No! (thudding) (intense music) (somber music) Put in wine and pull out silver, huh? Go away! It's not much. A thousand tails. Now, if you can help me I would give you two thousand. A thousand to buy her and a thousand more to run away with your Lin Chin. (ominous music) What do you want? Your fist is enough. Is enough? At last do you count me. Put the fists through. Friendship. What you say? Nothing. You can kill with one blow. Depends what fighter. President Chang. (foreboding music) Do you dare? Don't wanna kill him. But just to irritate the old bastard. It's a matter of honor. Go away. (ominous music) But it seems to me, two whole days, no money. Poor Lin Chin. Some lucky guy. (foreboding music) Wait. If I betray my master, how can I defeat him though? Right. All I want you to do is to steal his spear. That'll worry him and that'll be enough. You'd pay just for that? Of course. (somber music) No. It's not going to work. Brother Yang is always there. I'd never have a chance. Well, we'll just have to get Brother Yang out of the way. That'll delay him and give you the chance you need. (ominous music) Good. When he's out of the way, you get that spear and take it to Mistress Wan. You got that? (crickets chirping) (intense music) Master Pien, you remember your associates? You here? What for? When Master Pien has business, he should ask his brothers for help. You wouldn't try to cut us out, would you? You're joking. Our agreement to cooperate was a one off job. After that, each his own. How can you say I cut you out? (foreboding music) So you've made up your mind? We don't plan for you to be working all alone though. (blades swiping) (metal clinking) (whooshing) (slapping) (crunching) (yelling) (groaning) (thudding) (yelling) (intense music) (groaning) (whooshing) What's the matter? It's okay. I don't blame you. Last night, after you left, I was thinking. You have to win a thousand tails. It's impossible. But still, we sell everything, we still get very little. Our only chance is to see Miss Wan and beg for her help. Only way. (foreboding music) Elder brother. For me to beg is useless. Could you come with me? (somber music) On principle, I don't use that kind of place. Still, I might go for your sake. Sleep on it. Good night. (glass clanking) This guy, Yang, is coming here tonight. Now look, you wear him out, you know how to do that. Don't let him go. Until tomorrow, noon. Don't worry. Do you think I've forgotten my trade? (chuckling) (chiming music) (somber music) (man chanting) (people laughing) (speaking foreign language) Excuse me, have you seen my brother, Yow? No little brother, deary. Just little sisters here. (people laughing) Hey, come on. Hey. Hey! Miss, I'm sorry. Have you seen my brother, Yow? He came along with me to see Madame Wan. Mister Wan? Yeah. Oh, she's over there. (chiming music) Have a seat. I came here with my brother, Yow, to ask for something. Oh? I think my brother may have mentioned it. (giggling) If you're so embarrassed with me, just take it slowly. You can do it. It's about Lin Chin. Oh. On that matter, if anyone else asks me, I might agree. But still, seeing that's it's you. You'll agree? That depends. Just wait there. Hey. (chiming music) (moaning) What's wrong? (moaning) But. (somber music) (chiming music) (chiming) Yang Dow is a man of his word. Where is he now? Do you know that? I have no idea. Last night, he didn't get home. We can't wait. When Yang Dow gets back, tell him to follow on after us. Sir. Let's go. (exciting music) (gasping) (chiming music) (stammering) What's the matter? Last night, wasn't it good enough? I'm sorry. Hey! Now you're leaving? I've got something to do. (exciting music) (horse neighing) We rest here. When Yang catches up, we go on. Here. (horse neighing) (foreboding music) Master Chang, forgive me for this treachery. To save someone's life, I must borrow your spear. (intense music) Hello! But it's just me! (foreboding music) Wait! (horse galloping) Casualties, treachery. There are robbers. Where? (groaning) Right here. (ominous music) (thudding) (fluttering) (thudding) (intense music) (menacing music) Chang, recognize me? (gasping) Pien! (metal clanking) (laughing) Ten years ago, you defeated me in a fight. Do you think that I would forget my revenge? (gasping) (intense music) Pien, honor did not bring you here. Even if I die, you still won't find the half a million silver tails. (yelling) (groaning) (intense music) (whooshing) (groaning) (laughing) (gagging) (laughing) (galloping) (exciting music) (gasping) Lin Chin's contract. Master Yow, have you really brought back the President's spear? (slapping) God damn you. Where is it? You've come just one step behind someone else. And who was that? Yang Dah. (foreboding music) You lie. You don't believe it? The contract. Where is it? Come on! All right. (intense music) (ripping) (somber music) I knew that old bitch was cheating me. Come on. (ominous music) You're not Lin. (dramatic music) (ominous music) (fire crackling) Yang Dah! (intense music) Aren't you dead? You would like me dead, wouldn't you? Why'd you come back? And why shouldn't I? (thudding) Why kill the President? (intense music) I never touched him. Where are the pearls? Where are what pearls? You may be my brother, but I can still kill you! (slapping) Think I'm afraid? (thudding) (fluttering) (groaning) (fluttering) (thudding) (slapping) (fluttering) (slapping) (ominous music) (thudding) No! (whooshing) (dramatic music) (slashing) Talk! Where'd you hide the pearls? I know no pearls and I didn't kill him! (smacking) Your piece of bamboo. I took it from this throat. (ominous music) That's impossible. (intense music) (groaning) You have anything to say? (dramatic music) You're not a man. You're an animal! (thudding) (intense music) (gasping) (ominous music) (laughing) I have something to ask. Do you really love Lin Chin? You fool, I've never even seen her face. (dramatic music) Elder brother, promise me something. Please look after her. I hear your words. Thank you. (intense music) [Man] Anything there? I've looked both sides. Still nothing. Strange. Could Chan Ho's information be wrong? If this one hasn't got the goods, there's only one other could have. Huh? Who? Yow Cha Fang. (booming) (intense music) What you doing? Where's Lin Chin? I don't know. (thudding) Come on, tell me! Or you'll burn. The casino. (ominous music) (sizzling) I can't. (ominous music) (whooshing) (intense music) Yow Fang. You ratted on our deal. You just show up here. Now you just take a look up there. Lin Chin! (intense music) (blades slicing) (thudding) (yelling) (groaning) (swishing) (thudding) (groaning) (swooshing) (clanking) (groaning) (gagging) (fluttering) (slashing) (intense music) (ominous music) (yelling) (slapping) (zapping) Hi-yah! (thudding) (banging) (fluttering) (gagging) (menacing music) (trickling) (chiming music) (speaking foreign language) (gagging) (speaking foreign language) (groaning) (intense music) (thudding) (crashing) (groaning) (banging) (slapping) (crashing) (slapping) (thudding) (banging) (thudding) (fluttering) (slapping) (dramatic music) (slashing) (thudding) (crashing) (thudding) (intense music) (yelling) (fluttering) (groaning) (yelling) (booming) (intense music) (yelling) (gasping) (moaning) (dramatic music) (gasping) (intense music) (dramatic music) Elder brother. I'm not great. Gold tooth. Should we sell it to buy some noodles? Right. Okay. (crying) (dramatic music) (yelling) (sobbing) (dramatic music)
