- Tonight's lecture will focus on the paranormal in other cultures. One of the richest and most sophisticated networks of demonology and superstition is found in the ancient Aztec cultures. The Aztecs assigned religious significance to the stars. They believed that four of the heavenly bodies fell from grace with the divine forces and descended to Earth as demons. Three of the demons embodied the destructive forces of nature. Fire, water and wind. And the fourth, known as Destacatyl, was believed to control the dark side of the human soul. This is the only idol in existence today which is still believed to have true power. - It looks like a Mexican salt shaker. - That's very funny, Mr. Hopkins. As a matter of fact, your reaction is common, among the ignorant. - Well, I guess Destacatyl forgot to pay his electric bill, huh? - That will be all for tonight, you are dismissed. - Hello, Matthew. - Hello, Francis. I was wondering how long it would take you to find me. I must admit, I admire your tenacity. - Did you think I'd just give up? - No, frankly I expected you much sooner. - I saw what happened to your student. I see it's already gotten the better of you. - That's where you're wrong, Francis. You see, I've found a way to control it. - Don't be a fool, Matthew, the research shows-- - I've gone further than our research. I know what is possible. - You've gone too far, you can't control it. - Get out. - It's too late for you. - Get out. - Open the door, Matthew! Open up, Matthew! Matthew, open this door! If you've you got a key, open the door. Matthew! Where is it, Matthew? - Back. I sent it back. - Adios! - Show me your power. - Tonight at midnight. - Midnight? No way, Julie, I've got draft practice in the morning. - You promised! Matt's gonna do it. - You're really gonna do it, Matt? You're not afraid? - Well, I don't know. - You said you'd go. - I did not! I said I'd go if Tommy goes. - You really wanna do this, Julie? - It's not too late to back out. - It's all set, there's even a full moon tonight. Don't forget the good luck charms. - KHIR, Los Angeles, I am Chad Perry. It's a cool Thursday night and we're in the middle of-- - Tommy, did you finish doing your homework? - I'm on the last chapter, Mom. - Do you want a ride to school tomorrow? - I got it on my back. - Control Center Dad to Satellite Tommy. - Satellite Tommy? - I've got two tickets to the Lakers game Saturday, so we're all set. - Sure, that sounds great, Dad. - Don't forget to take the trash out in the morning. - I won't forget. - This is dumb, this is really dumb. - Shh. - It's not much farther. - What's wrong with right here, Julie? - No, there's a better place. - Matt, what did you do with your flashlight? - I broke it. - Oh, great. - I'm sorry. - Come on! - What is this place? - Looks like they made tombstones here. Oh my god. So you know somebody who works here? - Huh? - You told me you knew somebody who works here! - Oh, I just made that up, Matt. I knew you wouldn't come otherwise. - Julie! - Tommy, light the candle. This locket is to protect us from any evil that we may encounter. It was given to me by my great-grandmother. Matt, what did you bring? Matt. - Won't this work? - I suppose it will, as long as you believe it will work. - I believe it. - Tommy, what about you? - My parents brought it back from the trip, it's uh, it's supposed to bring good luck. - We're here to communicate with the spirit world. We have to start with the pointer in the middle of the board. Now let me ask the questions and don't take your hands off the pointer no matter what happens. We'd like to communicate with anyone that will communicate with us. - What are we supposed to do now? - Shh! Sometimes it takes a long time. - You moved it! - No. It's a spirit. We feel a presence here. Make yourself known. There's a force in this room. - That must be a sign! - Do you have a message for anyone here? - G. O. G. O. - Come on, let's get out of here. - No, let's try again! - Julie, it said "go," it wants us to go away. - No, it wants us to keep going! - It's getting late, my parents are gonna notice I've gone. - Yeah, I gotta get home too, come on, Julie. - Let's get outta here! - Come on! - We're gonna get in trouble. - Shut up, you guys. - For crying out loud. Damn kids. I don't know who's in here, but you better get the hell out. This is private property. Anybody down here? I heard you, now come on out of there. Oh, no. - Let me get this straight, a woman is mowing her lawn, she's attacked by a bunch of bees, now did she say how many? - It doesn't say. - Alright, so she must have walked into a hive or something. She's not gonna call the paper for a few bees, right? - Right. - Alright. How many bees in a hive, hundreds, thousands maybe? - Sure. - Okay. So, "woman attacked by legions of killer bees." - "Legions of killer bees." - That's the story. - Sandy, have you got a minute? - Sure, Roxanne, what do you need? - I don't know what to do with this bee story. - What bee story? - This woman was attacked by a bunch of bees. - Okay, how many bees? - Marty said to say 1,000. - Were there really 1,000 bees? - I don't think so. - Remember I told you, you should always check the facts before you go any further. Although round here that's not a very popular point of view. - The prince is in. - Oh, great, did you get a chance to talk to him? - Just for a second, I didn't get very far. - Well, wait a minute, here's the rat boy story. - That looks great, thanks. - Hey, what time is Mr. Prince's party on Sunday? - Oh, we're supposed to be there around three o'clock. Is Bernie coming with you? - Bernie's history. - That was fast. - Not fast enough. - Hey listen, I have a friend in from out of town who'll be there, you should meet him. - Okay! - Sandy! - Jerry, hey! - Hello. - Hi! - God, it's good to see you. - Oh, it's great to see you too, Jer. - Look at this place, I thought you were a starving writer? - Oh, thanks. Hey look, I cleaned out that closet for you. You can throw all your stuff in there. Can I get you a cup of coffee or something? - Oh, sure. - Great. - You got a beer? - Oh, yeah, you got it. - Hey, I got somethin' for ya. It's from the Radcliffe Banner. "For journalism is more than the sex lives of celebrities "and the scandals of the jet set. "Journalism is the pursuit of truth." Well I brought it to try and rekindle some inspiration. - Oh, I forgot, I gotta give my dad a call. I'll tell him that we'll see him after lunch, okay? - Uh, can we make it a long lunch? - So, I wanted to get away from the books, away from the four walls, so that we could open our minds up. Now we have a few minutes left, so is there anything anyone would like to talk about? Isn't there anybody that has anything they'd like to talk about? Yes, Julie. - What do you know about the supernatural? - What do you mean by the supernatural? - You know, spirits, communicating with the other side. - Alright, alright, now Julie asked a serious question, and I think it's important that we deal with it. There are quite a few people who believe in the supernatural. I don't happen to be one of them, but-- - Mrs. Lawrence, isn't it impossible to accurately document cases dealing with the supernatural? Are people who put their faith in these things in effect making up for imbalances in their life? - Well, Mark, that may be coming out a little bit strong, but I see your point. Oh, now listen, listen. Don't forget we have a quiz tomorrow. - Hey, Julie, you don't seem to be in good spirits, today. - Come on, knock it off, Rick. - Clone head. - What'd you say, punk? - Nothing, I didn't say anything. - They're the ones that don't understand. - Julie, maybe they're right, I mean, what proof do we have? - We felt it. Didn't we? - Anyway, if I have to write one more story about talking dogs or UFOs, I think I'm gonna go crazy. - I tell you what you should do. Come with me to Europe. Just quit, boom. We'll be in London this weekend. - Well, I wish it was that easy. I mean, I can't just take off and go. I have too many things goin' on here. - That's not the real reason now, is it? - It is, really, I can't. - How come you never answered that letter? - Which one? - The one that was on your desk. - I didn't know how to answer it. - I'm sorry, I didn't wanna make you feel uncomfortable. - I was gonna call. - Look, we've known each other a long time. And we were friends first. And that's the most important thing. - Right, Jerry, that is the most important thing. - I was hoping you wouldn't agree. - Jerry-- - Yeah, no, it's um... It was a mistake. We both agreed it was a mistake, it's one of those things. One of the people likes the other more than, oh whatever. Um, let's get outta here. Ready? - Okay. You ready to see my dad? - Does he still think I'm the one who was stealing his mail? - No, but he has a million other reasons why he doesn't like you. Sounds like Jerry's got great plans, doesn't it, Dad? - Yeah, Jerry's got lots of plans. - Yeah, speaking of which, I think I better get going. - Are you sure you don't want a ride? - I think I'll just take the bus. - Oh, you can catch it right down the street. - Okay, thanks, Mr. McKennah. I'll see you later, Sandy. - Okay, Jerry. - I'll try and stop by before I leave. Bye. - I can hardly wait. - If he warms up the Sixers are in trouble. It's 67 to 61, Chief looks in. Jones gives out to Banham, dribbles right down the middle, throws it from eight, they'll get the rebound. Jones has got it, fine call by Caldwell. Now at the baseline to Chief, Chief's out of West Texas State, looks for Banham. Closing up on Wilks, he gives it to Banham. He's gonna turn and shoot, he does turn and shoot. He scores, offensive foul, no basket. Boy, that was a mighty fine move by Banham. He must have used that left arm on Kareem in order to get that shot off and that's exactly what he did, after he put Wilks in the popcorn machine. 67 to 61, the Lakers lead as Magic coming in the front door. Magic in a thrill-packed encounter here between the East and the West, Magic down the middle, Magic turns, sees short, rebound is off, Kareem has got it back accidentally from Masterson, Kareem with the dribble. He loads to Magic, Kareem's all wound up. Magic hookshot his six is no good. He makes this place explode. - It's just that it's so hard to believe. Are you sure you weren't dreaming? - I wasn't dreaming, Matt. - What did you do with it? - I hid it. - Are you alright? - I think so. Thanks for coming over. - What did you wanna tell us, Julie? - I didn't wanna talk to you guys about this on the phone. I picked this up tonight. - What is it? - You're not gonna believe this. Page two. - Hello. - Is this the McKennah residence? - Yeah, this is Sandy McKennahs. - Is Sandy there? - No, she's not in right now. Can I take a message? - Yes, I was calling about a story in the Prince Eye Witness. - Uh, yeah, wait a minute, just a minute. - It's really important, you see, I was with two-- - Yeah, slow down, slow down. - Do you know about that article on the guard that was killed? - Yeah, that's uh... Yeah, I know that article, I know the one on page two. - Yes, that's it. - Right. - We were at the cemetery that night. - Okay, it was the three of you. Wait a minute, you were there when this happened? - We were there right before it, and we'd really like to talk with Sandy about it. - Okay yeah I'm sure Sandy would be very interested in this. Okay, why don't you give me some details? - Well, we went there with a ouija board. - Really? - Yeah, you see, were trying to... - Jerry, it's Sunday. - It'll just take a few minutes. I mean, look, I thought you might be interested. You know, like a follow-up story? - Do you know how many people come to me with stories just like this? - No, this is different. I mean, they sounded really legitimate to me. - Right, little trinkets that kill people. I mean, how legitimate does that sound? - I don't know, this is your business. I'm just trying to help. - Five minutes, that's it. We have to get back and get ready for the party. I told Roxanne you were handsome, so you'll need plenty of time to get ready. - Sandy. These are the people I was telling you about. It's Julie, Tommy and Matt. - Hi. - This is Sandy McKennah. - Nice to meet you. Why don't you have a seat? - Thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us. We really didn't wanna go to the police. We wanted to see you first. - This is an amazing story, like it told you before, they were there the night the guard was killed. - You want me to cover your story for the Eye Witness? - No, we don't want it in the paper. - Well, then I really don't understand how I can help you. - We read the Eye Witness every week, and we always make it a point to read your stories. And you say that you talk to experts all the time about things like this. - But you weren't actually there when it happened, were you? - We were there right before it happened. But we do know what caused it. - Right, it was some kind of jewelry or something? - No, it was an idol. Did you bring it with you, Julie? - Sure, I'll go get it. - Okay, now one of you had some kind of experience at your house? Why don't you tell me about it? - This is really gonna sound strange. But like I was telling Jerry, uh, I was in my room and I had that thing with me. And it started acting like a magnet. - Um, excuse me. Make sure you tell her the part about the speaker, okay? - Things were attracted to it, I mean, things were sticking to it. - So that's it, huh? - Do you think Sandy will help us? - Yeah, I do. We talked about it before you guys came over and she is really receptive to the idea. The problem is, she's a little busy right now. So we decided that I'd take care of the basic groundwork. I've already got some ideas. - Well, whatever you think is best. - Okay, um, can I take a look at it? But right now let's just keep this between you and me, okay? - Yeah, alright. - Okay. - Well, it sounds like you've all had an incredible experience. But see, the paper doesn't really have any connections with experts. I really appreciate you bringing all of this to my attention but I just don't see how I can help you. - It's alright, we understand. Bye. - Bye bye. - Bye bye. So what did you think? - It's about what I expected. Look, I've heard the same kind of thing in a million different ways. They're nice kids, Jerry. Maybe they just want some attention. - So nothin', huh? - We're gonna be late for the party. Why don't you get the car? - Okay. - I'll meet you out front! - Thank you, Carmine. - That is fascinating. I would love to do a story about it. - No, we don't want it in the paper. Oh hi, Sandy. What we wanna do is just get to the bottom of this thing. Find out exactly what it is. - I understand. - Jerry, what are you doing with that thing? - I'm just telling Roxanne the story. - I thought I made myself clear, Jer. I don't wanna have anything to do with that. - I haven't asked you to. I know how kinda skeptic you are. - Uh, listen, I see somebody I know. I'll see you tomorrow night, okay? - Yeah, okay. - Alright, how'd you wind up with that? - The kid gave it to me. I told her I'd look into it for her. - Jerry, I think this is the biggest waste of time. You're getting yourself-- - It's okay, it's my time. - Fine. Do whatever you want, Jer. - No, I'm not gonna be able to go, something came up here. Look, I'm the one who wanted to go in the first place. It's just something came up here, I gotta follow it through. No, no, it's too involved to go into over the phone. Look, it's nothin' like that, it's just, see, I found this thing and it's this relic or something, these kids ran into it. I don't know what it's worth, Gary, I don't care. I've been readin' about this thing. I think I'm really onto somethin'. Look, I gotta go now, okay, I'll tell you about the whole thing when I get to London, alright? Yeah. Okay, bye. - Sandy, this is Ron. I'm still waiting for material for page two tomorrow. I don't care what it is, make something up if you have to. But I want it on my desk first thing in the morning. - Jesus, Jerry. - Jesus, what the hell happened? Hey, are you alright? - Did you see anybody on your way up here? - No. - Somebody must have broke-- - Shh, shh. - Oh my god. - Everything in here is still locked. Where were you when all this happened? - I was in bed asleep. I thought I heard something, so I got up. At first I thought it was you. - You didn't see anything? - I told you, I was asleep! I had this horrible nightmare. - How do you think they got in? - I don't know, Jerry. I don't know. I guess I have to call the police. You know, they told me when I moved into this place that this was a safe neighborhood. Think I'm gonna have to call my insurance company tomorrow. - I don't think your insurance will cover this. Nobody broke in here. - What? - Nobody broke in. I mean, your purse, there's still money in it, there's a fork stuck in the wall, and your phone machine is melted. Nobody broke in here. - Right, Jerry, what do you think, I just decided to go berserk in my own apartment? Jerry. Jerry, what are you looking for? - What's that kid's number? - Who? - Julie, what's-her-name. - Jerry, just stop, okay? Would you please just stop trying to play detective and maybe give me a hand here? I mean, what do you think that the girl had something to do with this? - Yeah, I do! Look, don't you think it's a coincidence, just a little weird? Okay, the kid comes to you with this thing after his room comes apart, now it's here and look at this place! This is no burglary, nobody broke in here. - I've had it with you, Jerry. I mean it, I'm just so sick of your bullshit. Now you're seein' ghosts everywhere and talkin' about that stupid clay thing! Jerry, this is exactly why things never worked out between us. - Fuck you. - Sandy. Mr. Prince wants to see you in his office right away. - Thanks, Roxanne. - Sandy, I'm glad you're here. - What's going on here? - Go ahead, Marty. - "Beautiful young reporter is true eye-witness "to ancient curse." "Ravishing reporter is naked in shower, "as midnight phantom wreaks havoc." - Needs a little work, what do you think? - Look, you know it wasn't a burglary. - That's not the point, you embarrassed me. It goes beyond embarrassment. You made a fool out of me in there. - I wouldn't have happened if you'd helped me in the first place. - I told you in the beginning that I didn't wanna get involved, you knew how I felt about it. - You know, I remember a time when Sandy McKennah would have jumped at a story like this. - Not like this, Jerry, believe me, I've chased down too many crackpot stories to get excited about this one. - Yeah and I think that's your problem, you've become so closed-minded, you won't give anything half a chance. - This thing has really become an obsession with you, Jer. You know, I remember a few times when your open mind got you into trouble and this is the same thing. It's just another dead-end for you to waste your time on and that's fine, but leave me out of it. I have more important things to do. - Oh my god. - Shit! Where did you put it? Damnit! Sandy? - No, it's Julie, is this Jerry? Listen, I've found something out about the idol. - Do you have it? - No, that's why I called! We have to get rid of it, it says here it works its power through the people that have it. We have to tell Sandy! Jerry, are you there? Did you hear what I said? Jerry, hello? Jerry, are you there? - Destacatyl? Oh, you must be very old. You must know everything. I wonder where your power comes from. Do you have any real power? They're all afraid, except me. But I've never seen your power. Show me. Knock it off the desk. Take this. Or this. Anything! Look, you took this room apart. Put it back the way it was. Then maybe it's true. Maybe you can't do anything by yourself. You need somebody. You need me. - We can't do it now, it's too late. - We have to. - Julie, why can't it wait till the morning? - Fine, if you don't want to, then I'll go by myself. - Come on. - Hi, Jerry. I guess I'm early. Are you ready yet? I tried to call you but I guess no one was home. Oh my god. What happened here? You guys had a party without me, didn't you? What happened to your hand? Are you alright? You better let me take care of that. This place is a mess. - Did you bring your car? - Yeah, we'll take my car. - Where are the keys? - What? Let me take care of your hand first. - Where are the car keys? - I'll be there in a second. - Give me the keys. - What do you want my keys for? - I gotta have your car. - Jerry, I'm sorry but nobody drives my car but me. - Give me the god-damn car keys. - Jerry, you're hurting my hand. Jerry, what are you doing? Jerry, don't! No! Stop it! - Hello, Prince Eye Witness. - Sandy. - Hello? - Sandra. - Dad? - Come home. - Dad? - Is anybody home? - We can't go in there. - You can stay here if you want, Matt. - Come on, let's go. - Just hurry up. - Hey, you guys! There's a note here, it says she's at her father's house! - She's probably got the address in here. - Should we go in here? - No, here it is, let's go. - Dad? Dad? - Sandy. - Jerry, what are you doing here? What happened to my father, is he here? - I'm glad you're here. - Why? What's happened? Jerry, what is going on? - Everything's alright now. I don't want you to be alarmed. They took your father away about 20 minutes ago. - Who did? What happened? - The ambulance. He was having trouble breathing. - Where did they take him? - The nearest hospital was full, they didn't know where they'd take him. They said they'd call when they knew. - Oh my god. Oh, he called me at work and I just rushed right over here. - I tried to call you at work. - Jerry, what are you doing here? - You should have taken better care of him. He was all alone here. - What? - Since your mom died, things have been tough on him. He was tellin' me all about it. - Jerry, I don't know what your problem is. - You're all he had. If you had your way, he'd be dead by now. - Yes, I need the paramedics, please, this is an emergency. Santa Monica. Yeah, this is 7735 Birmingham Road. Look, please hurry, I just need some information. Hello? Hello? Hello? Shit. I've had enough of this, Jerry! Jerry, where the hell are you? God damnit, Jerry, talk to me! What is wrong with you? You'd better start explaining what is going on here. Are you listening to me? God damnit, Jerry, I wanna know where my father is and I wanna know now. - Sandy! I lied. - I'm leaving. - Sandy! Help me. I've never been so confused, I... I'm sorry. I've lost control. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I'm scared. Please don't leave me. I mean, don't make me face this thing alone. I need you now more than I ever have. I found something. And it's, it's strange. And it's powerful. And it's real. And you don't understand just how real it is. You don't have any idea. Do you wanna see? I'll show you. It doesn't hurt. See, this gives me power. And you wanted to take it away from me. - Jerry. I wanna help you, I'm your friend. Let me see it, Jer. Can I touch it? Let me have it. Give it to me, Jer. Jerry, give it to me! - Your father. Go look in your bedroom. - Oh, god. Jerry? - Shh, come on. - Sandy? Sandy McKennah? Sandy? - What are you doing here? - Jerry. We were looking for Sandy. - Sandy. She's back in her bedroom, she's not feeling well. I think you'd better leave. Move! - Go, Matt, come on! - Hey, wait! Help! Hurry up, come on! - No, Matt, it's gonna be too late. We've gotta go back and get Julie. - We'll try and get help, there's nothing else we could do! - It's gonna be too late, come on! - Look! - Matt. Come here, help me with this. - What're we gonna do when we get in there? - Just shut up, we gotta find Julie and get her outta here. Julie! Julie! Julie. Julie! - What're we gonna do now? - There's gotta be a way inside. - You want the idol? You can't have it. - I came here to tell what I found out. - I know what you found out, and that's why you came here to get it. Sandy tried to take this away from me. She thinks I'm going insane. Stupid bitch. - Where's Sandy now? - Doesn't matter. Don't you understand? I have the power now, and there's nothin' anyone can do to take it away. You're afraid, aren't you? Aren't you? You think you understand this thing. You don't. You don't have a clue. I know what you're thinking. You want the power, but you're afraid. You think it's evil. Well that's the only power in this world. And only those people who can control that power can avoid being destroyed by it. - What are you gonna do now? - The power needed someone like me. Someone to control it, I control the power now. - Please let me go. - I can't do that. - Come on. Here, I got a match. Let's get out of here! - Come on, let's get out of here! Help me pull it! - Pull it open! Oh, god. - We can get out the window. Block the door with something. - Wait, listen. - Give it to me! - No, don't! Don't give it to him, no! - Give me the idol. Give it to me! - No, don't! - I have to. - No, you can't! Don't, Sandy! - Let her go! - No! - Come on, let's get out of here! - What? Can't you see what's happening? I need something heavier! - Come, get this! He's coming through the door! - Goodnight. - I didn't mean to frighten you. - I'm sorry, the library's closed. - I know. I'm Francis Lott. I've tried to see you. You're Julie Robinson? - Yes. - I wanted to talk to you about something. You're mentioned quite a bit in Sandy McKennah's book. - My name's not in that book. - I know. It's been very hard locating you. - What do you want? - Could I talk to you about some experiences you've had? The things that are in here. - I'm sorry, the library's closed, I have to lock up. - I, too, have had many experiences. I still bear the mark of my encounter with Destacatyl. There are many things I wanna tell you about, things I think would interest you. There must be more to your story, too! Maybe we could talk. - Look, Mr. Lott, everything that happened to me is in that book, there's nothing more I can tell you. - But the power can never be destroyed. I think you know that. - Goodnight. - Miss Robinson. I'm sorry I upset you. I think I know what you've been through. Miss Robinson, please, don't cry.
