The action takes place in the fancy of a feverish dream You can come now, Doctor. What's his temperature? - 40.2 degrees. His pulse is only sixty. Well, well. He doesn't want to lie on his back. Meningitis. Tetanus. Get him ready for a lumbar puncture and hold him tight, nurse. Who is he? - We don't know. He was found unconscious on the embankment with nothing on him at all. Not even an identity card. That's too bad. A man in delirium. Maybe we'll never find out his name. His hands are all cut and burnt. He could be a chemist. We'll see what the test will show. He has trouble breathing. Give him oxygen, nurse. Long wandering... Long... wandering. Sorry. Excuse me, are you Prokop? Are you Prokop? I wasn't there. - Where? There. What do you want from me? Don't you recognize me? It's me, Tomes. From the university, don't you remember? - Tomes? Of course, Tomes. What do you want from me? - You'd better sit down first. Understand? - Yes. I'm not feeling well, you see? I'm injured. Damn it. - We studied chemistry together. Do you remember? I'm Tomes. Tomes, that rascal. What about him? He's fine. He's talking to you. Listen, you have a fever. You should be in bed. Understand? Where do you live? - There. Near Hybsmonka. I don't want to go there. Don't go there. There's... There's... - There's what? Krakatit. - What is it? Krakatoa, a volcano. A volcano, you see? It's a horrible thing. - What? Kraka... Krakatit. Who is it? Who are you? I'm your colleague, Tomes. - Tomes. That scamp! He borrowed my lecture notes. He never returned any of my chemistry exercise-books. Wait, let me tell you something. When the rest blows up, it'll be hell. The whole city will be swept. Blown away. Wait, that's not possible. It's nonsense. - What? - Why... Why didn't the container explode? When the powder on the table... All by itself... Wait! Be quiet. What's the matter with you? - Krakatit. Rest. It's nervous fever, you'll feel better in the morning. I've discovered methods. Destructive chemistry. Matter is terribly powerful. It holds together with great strain, but it disintegrates if you tamper with it. Everything explodes! Every idea is a crack in your brain, you see? My head is buzzing. Like a machine gun. Swallow this aspirin now. - Yes. Explosive aspirin. Perchlorated acetylsalicyl acid. Any substance is in fact an explosive. Water is an explosive. I've discovered atomic explosions. I've carried out alpha explosions. If I only had the proper instruments. But all I have are my eyes and hands. - Aren't you sleepy? I am. What were you doing all this time? Nothing. That's life. Life is an explosive, you know? Boom! A man is born and decays instantly. While to us it seems like ages, doesn't it? You're right. Maybe, I'll do BOOM tomorrow. When I don't have the money. Mr. Prokop shall take his colloquium. Tell us what you know about explosives. What are alpha explosions? Alpha explosions. An explosion is the result of atomic disintegration. Atomic particles disperse... - Nonsense! There are no atoms! And you dare to take your colloquium, eh! What do you know about Krakatit? Krakatit is... It is a new explosive, so far not... What ignites it? What causes it to explode? Herz waves. - How do you know that? Because it exploded unexpectedly and because... - Well? I've achieved its synthesis under high-frequency oscillation. I believe these were some kind of electromagnetic waves. You must prove that! What is the formula for Krakatit? Pb-Ar4. What? What did you say? Pb-Ar4. - Pb tetrargon? How many? Two. - How is it made? What is the process? The procedure! How is Krakatit made? Why do you want to know? - Never mind. You've had a bad dream. Rest, my friend. Who is it? I went to my father. If I do not get the money, I will not come back. Jiri. Does Mr. Tomes live here? - Come in. Mr. Tomes isn't in? - He left. Last night, miss. - Where did he go? He went to his father. - Will he return? Do you think he will do it? It is so dreadful! He doesn't know that someone... He doesn't have to do it, you see? If someone goes to him today. I have to give him something. A letter from someone. So that... I can't tell you. There's no need. I'll go to him and give it to him. We're old friends, you know? Is it raining? I trust you. You will save him, won't you? I'd be pleased to do it. I, miss... It's not worth mentioning. Thank you. Thank you very much. The letter. But you are injured! Let me see. - It's nothing serious. Just a small cut became inflamed, you see? But you can't go anywhere like this. Let me go. Why I'm... I'm doing it for you. I am so grateful to you. Goodbye. Should I give him your regards? No. Goodbye. My diagnosis was correct. It is meningitis. We will give him 4,000 units of penicillin. And the oxygen so that he doesn't stop breathing. It is such a pity that we do not know who he is. The poor man doesn't even have a name. Take me to Tynice, please. I can't. - Why? The car is full. But... But I have to see Doctor Tomes. Are you his patient? - I'm sick. Sit over here then. Gee! This is where Doctor Tomes lives. Be quiet, Jack! Is the doctor in? - Come in. What seems to be trouble, young man? - l... The thing is... Is your son home? He isn't. What's the matter with you? Jiri... I'm his friend and I bring him... I am to give him... It's very important. Jiri is in Prague. You'd better sit down. Jiri isn't home? But he said he was going here. I have to give him... Bring a chair, Annie! Long wandering. Long wandering. Come now! You've had enough sleep, don't you think? Wake up. That's enough. Or you will wake up in the other world. What do you want and who are you? You haven't taken cognizance of me yet, have you? I'm Doctor Tomes. - I'm Prokop. I thought you were Sleeping Beauty. Besides, how did you get here? Where here? - Here in Tynice. You came here in a delirium and then you passed out. Where did you come from? I don't know. From Prague, I suppose. With meningitis and pneumonia on top. And what about your hand? Fine blood poisoning indeed! You shouldn't go on trips with something like that. As soon as you get better, I'll tell you that you were an ass. Forgive me, I almost said something much worse. How are you feeling? A bit stupefied, eh? No memory, eh? It will take some time. You mustn't rack your brain. Understand? It will come back. Little by little. Stay awake, damn it! Fetch some wine, Annie. Hey, wake up! You could sleep for good, do you hear me? You must overcome it. - You can't sleep. I won't. - I'd advise you not to. You'll get some books and you'll read. I have to go to the surgery. You stay here, Annie, and chatter with him. You've got the gift of the gab, eh? In case he wants to sleep, call me. I'll have it out with him. You've made me happy though. Understand? Watch out! Daddy is quite hot-headed. He is used to yelling at his patients. You've never been to our village, have you? There's nothing here, just alleys and fields. It was happier when Jiri used to come here. But then, he fell out with Daddy because of money and hasn't written a letter since. We're not allowed to talk about him. Daddy forbid it. I don't know what to talk to you about. Give it to me. That's enough. I'll do it myself. What were you thinking about? That I've known nothing but work so far. And that maybe there's something more than just to think. One simply lives here. And to live is something wonderful, isn't it? Why do you always hide your hands whenever I'm around? Because... Because they are so scared. But that's what is so beautiful about them. Lunch is ready! Oh my, it's lunch already. There's no pharmacy in the village, you see? And the people are poor here. So I have to make the medicine myself. Even if my sight is no longer good. Let me do it, Doctor, to be at least of some use. Besides, I shouldn't be bothering you any longer. Do you want to leave? I'll have to leave sooner or later. - What a silly idea! You haven't won yet. Your illness can return. Well, well! You've got quite skilful hands. They've been doing this for quite a few years. Making different substances though. Explosives. I've invented tremendous things. If only I could recall my last experiments. All I know is that I've experimented with something horrible. I completely forgot. I only have a feeling that I was to go somewhere. To give something to someone. To bring something. I have a splitting headache. Drink this. Maybe it's good after all. Just imagine how many lives you'd have on your conscience, if that horrible thing was used in the event of a war. But what if that horrible thing puts everyone in fear. You cannot enforce peace with any explosive. How then? - How? With better education. I believe in working people. If you knew people like I do. People are the happiest when they succeed in their work. You'll see that one day everyone will find out that there's no sense in building one's well-being on the misery of others. Simply because nobody will put up with it for long. And then, everyone will work together and stop fighting over something that doesn't belong to them. Am I right? These are fine ideals indeed, though I'm a practician. I believe in science and inventions. They will change the face of the world. - They will. But depending on who possesses them. There's a man from Sedmidoli here, his wife is in labour. Sedmidoli? That's not my district. Good evening. Our doctor refused to come. It's quite far. It seems I'll have a sleepless night. Good night. - Good night. Go to bed, Annie. Good night. Will you be writing now? - I will. All evening? All evening. Is there anything else you'd like? No, nothing. Very well. What's the matter with you, Annie? Is anything wrong? Tell me. Never mind. You're so kind, Annie. So nice. And the feeling that I am fond of you makes me so happy. I will never go away. Why were you crying? Tell me. Because it took you so long. You love me, don't you? No! No! It's so beautiful here. It seems all so unbelievable to me. I'd like to stay here. Good night, Annie. What if your father comes back. Good night. Good night. Krakatit - Engineer P. is to advise of his address. Carson Why... Why didn't the container explode? To Mr. Jiri Tomes I trust you. You will save him, won't you? How is it made? The procedure! How is Krakatit made? Tomes and Carson. I told him everything. You will save him, won't you? Find your friend and give him this letter. It's a forged bill of exchange. I paid it off. He wants to kill himself because of it. I beg you to save him. I'll go and find him if I promised you to do so. I trust you so much. Goodbye. - Wait, miss. When will I see you again? Put your hands up! What do you want here? Well, I'm home here. And what do you want here? I'm looking for you. Did you read my ad? I did. - I've been searching for you for six weeks! Through newspapers, private detectives. I'm truly glad, damn it! Why did you break in and rob me? - What? Why did you rob me? - Are you saying I robbed you? Yes, you robbed me! - I beg your pardon! Me, Carson, a robber? You amaze me! I hid it so that somebody didn't steal it. Either one state or the other of course. True superpowers were coming and going all the time. It's no small thing. And I hid it, understand? You have my word. I want to bargain with you. You've got a great career ahead of you. You can get yourself the best laboratory in the world. The best instruments and a legion of assistants. Whatever you wish. Like in America. You can make millions. What is it that you want? Don't be a fool and sell Krakatit to us. How do you know? - I'll tell you. Mr. Tomes came and he brought 150 grams of Krakatit. And the formula. Unfortunately, he didn't know the procedure. Neither he nor our chemists were able to figure out how to put it together. In our factory. - What factory? - The Balttin Works. Haven't you heard? No. - It's a foreign enterprise. Labs experimenting with modern explosives. For army purposes, you see? - And is Tomes at the Balttin Works? Of course he is. At first, we arrested him as a spy. Lots of spies are trying to get inside so it doesn't matter. And as to Krakatit, we had it tested. - And the result? Colossal. Twelve dead in two days. On the 3rd day, some idiotic lab assistant left a pinch lying on the table. And at night, when the lab was closed... It exploded! - Yes, at 10.35 pm. It blew up the whole lab and two other buildings with it. Some sixty dead to put it short. That is a success, isn't it? It turned out there was nobody in the lab. That it had to explode... - By itself. Yes. Did the same happen to you? - After 10 o'clock in the evening. You see? It's useless if you can't control it. Sell it to us and you'll get rid of it. You could demand some twenty million. Sell Krakatit to us. - No. Twenty million! Sell it to us! No. I don't want anything to do with your wars! No. - And what do you have here? An ingenious chemist like you living in a shack! Besides, you're a scholar. Why should you care about others? Why don't you sell it? I won't. You're right. You'd be a fool to sell it for twenty million. We'll sell it to somebody else. You can rely on Carson. Well? I can see you're a man of character. Very well. Let me tell you a secret. Let's shake hands on it. I didn't ask you. A discrete man. I like you. You're my type. So, you said it exploded by itself after 10 o'clock in the evening, eh? Wasn't it a Tuesday by chance? I think so. Why? We've made some experiments. We left a milligram of Krakatit on the table and it regularly exploded on Tuesday and Friday at 10.30 pm. What does it mean? - And coincidentally, for about 6 months now, all European radio stations are malfunctioning at the same time. Someone is deleting their communication. What do you say to that? It means that if you spill Krakatit here or anywhere on the ground... It would blow up by next Tuesday or Friday. Stop it. That's terrible! Who has Krakatit in his hands can blow up anything whenever... - No, only on Friday and Tuesday. Blow up whole cities, whole armies. Everything! It can be dispersed by an aircraft... Can you imagine that? Of course I can. Colossal. And therefore, in the interests of the world, I shall never give it away! Never! - And therefore, in the interests of the world, we ought to find that... - What? That damned secret station. - Do you think that... I think that Krakatit is a horrible thing. And that secret station is even worse. And should someone get hold of both, I'd rather live among cannibals. What's the matter with you? Collect yourself. Come on. There. I've been ill for a long time. And I'm still not feeling quite well. I haven't eaten the whole day. - I see, of course. You must eat something. It's alright. The future is what counts. You've had some really hard times, eh? Don't you worry. You'll be on your feet again. You'll get a lot of money, you'll be a big man. And you'll give me 10 percent, won't you? It's an international custom. At last, the car is here. Let's go! Where? - To have something to eat. I'm a big man! I can light a cigarette with a million banknote. Of course you can. Big man. You're my friend, Carson. I'll tell you everything. - What? I'm terribly in love with a woman with a veil. Stop! Stop! I'm getting off! Stop! Let me go! Go to hell! Hands off! Let me go or... Where did you take me? - To Prince Hagen's house at Balttin. Gigantic ammunition works. Come, I'll introduce you to our host. Our distinguished guest, Mr. Prokop, His Highness, Prince Hagen-Balttin. The President of the Board of Directors of the Balttin Works. How do you like the old man? A genuine museum piece, eh? Well, he's still manages the job, although he regularly has a stroke every week. Let's bow to the princely family and the Balttin court. His Grace, Prince Egon. Her Highness, Princess Hagen. His Majesty, ex-King Fritz X. Her Majesty, ex-Empress Margaret. His Excellency, Count Hacke and Her Grace, the Countess. Former General Director, Sir Bonifac Wulfe. Former General Ambassador, the Earl of Tewton. And the former bank concern Director, Mr. Düring. This way. It's like some ancient world of the past. They appear as if they're not alive. - They only look that way. They're waiting for Balttin to wage war and to return their thrones to them. They'll come back to life. Don't you worry. It's a pity I don't have Krakatit now. - This is Baron Rohn. The Director of the Balttin Works. Let me introduce Mr. Prokop, sir. It is very kind of you to call on us, Mr. Prokop. I did not. This is an outrageous restraint on individual freedom! This is kidnapping, gentlemen! There are laws forbidding this! Not so loud! Other laws apply here. Come on. Wait till I show you the labs. Most up-to-date. - I don't care. Look over there. She is in command here. It's the old man's daughter, Princess Wilhelmina. A pretty girl, eh? She's 28. Keen on dangerous sports. I must introduce you to her. Get me out of here or... - Your Excellency, let me introduce the famous... - No need. I know the gentleman. His Excellency, Mr. d'Hémon. - I've heard much about you. Your work in destructive chemistry, and particularly your discovery of the alpha explosions are truly envied by experts. Your study on energy... Your Grace, allow me to introduce our guest, Mr. Prokop, even though against his will to some extent. He is a ferocious man. He wants to kill me. I am pleased that you have come here. - It isn't true. I was dragged here. Order them to release me at once, Your Grace! Perhaps you should not use such harsh words in front of the Princess. Mr. Prokop does not like it here? - He'll get used to it. I hope to see you more often. Do you go horse riding? He doesn't. - What games do you play? He doesn't play any games. Mr. Prokop is a scholar. He can release atomic energy. He discovered atomic explosions and things like that. He's a magician. What is atomic energy? If we succeeded in developing and discharging all the energy contained in this at once, we could blow up Mont Blanc with Chamonix. But we'll never succeed. - You can do it. It seems he will become very famous. - Like Darwin. Dukes will consider it an honour to carry the tip of the flag covering his coffin. If there are any dukes then. Nonsense. - That's very interesting. Tell him to enlighten me on the subject one day. Goodbye. That woman is of the finest breed. Quite proud, isn't she? Wait till you get to know her better. It seems you're mistaken, Carson. I have no intention of getting to know anyone better. I'm leaving tomorrow. What a pity. It's very nice here. Oh well, nothing doing. Stop fooling around and take me to Tomes, I have to speak to him. To Tomes? I'm afraid I can't. He's not here. He took his money and ran off. He lead us a merry dance. Where is he now? - I can't tell you right now. Maybe he's trying to make Krakatit for another country. Don't you worry. He'll never manage. Ditch him. And what about my Krakatit? - It's gone. All that remained of it. 90 grams. - It was stolen? Including the lead container. And with it a Saxon lab assistant disappeared. But we'll take it out on you. I'll show you the new lab tomorrow. - You won't let me go then! Mr. Prokop! Don't go to the fence! Danger High Voltage You should leave, Your Grace, it's becoming dangerous here. Be so kind and leave me alone, will you? Careful! Don't shoot! That man has tremendous value for us. - Don't shoot! You were too mild with him and here you have it. That man interests me. What a shame! What a scandal! There's no one there. They're not coming back. I've sent them away. I wanted to tell you that I deem you as my guest. I will allow no one to touch you. Carson told me you could tell a person's character by touch. One feels what power is hidden inside. It's nothing. Let me see. Well? Virginal, insensible, lustful, furious, and proud. Torrid like the desert and wicked. You are wicked, avid, and hard on yourself. Ice and fire, fire and ice. Thank you for being so sincere. I heard you could make explosives out of anything. Is it true? I could make an explosive out of your powder, if you wanted. There's so enough powder on you to burn out a cannon. I didn't know that powder was an explosive. Everything is an explosive if in the right hands. You yourself... What? - Nothing. A concealed explosion. You are highly explosive. If I get in the right hands. I take your word for it. Let me know when my powder-box blows up. It was a pleasure to meet you. So these are the Balttin Works, Mr. Prokop. How do you like it so far? Not bad, eh? The buildings with the letters and numbers down there are ammunition dumps. The hills covered with grass over there are warehouses and the railway station is a bit further. Do you see the woods? The experimental labs are behind it. And the sand hills over there, that's the shooting range. Just wait till you see the lab! It's the most up-to-date. - Take me there. - Sure. I'll make an explosive out of this powder-box. I'm not doing this for you. I made a promise to the Princess. Out of what? Powder? Do you think you can make us believe that? This quantity can have the same disruptive power as 100 kg of ecrasite. Not bad, eh? Did you hear that, gentlemen? I take your word for it. Under one condition though. - Yes? That you let me go after that. - Of course. The lab is ready. You can begin straight away. Come. Here it is, Powderit, the best explosive cosmetic powder. It hasn't lost even a bit of its fragrance. You've finally come to your senses. I hope you'll let me go now. I want to leave tomorrow. Of course, but we'll talk about that later. Now I'm anxious to see what you can do with the powder. It will explode in half an hour. - I'll get the Princess. Are the nearest buildings cleared? - Yes. I've sealed the whole area within a radius of 1 kilometre. Everything is as you wanted. Watch out! Stop! - Stop, Your Grace. Come back! Down! Get down! Damn it! You beast. Darling. Give me your hand. You mustn't. Not now. - Can I get up now? That was a wonderful explosion. - Was that all? For Chrissake, as if it weren't enough. A single powder-box. You're a wizard! You've sold your soul to the devil, eh? The King of Matter. Behold, Your Grace, the King. By Golly! We're nothing but rag-and-bonemen. And it isn't Krakatit yet. Stay here, you cannot come with me. And tomorrow? - Don't wait for me, they would see you. I'll run away tomorrow. - They'll kill you. I'd be better off. - Come and have a look at the crater. A good five meters. What disruptive power. Congratulations. Why is that man guarding me all the time? Mr. Holz? - Yes, Mr. Holz. He's responsible for your safety, Sire. So that you can work without being interrupted. It's a joy to work in a fine lab like this, isn't it? Indeed. I'd like to know what right you have to detain me here! Detained? Didn't somebody let you go in the park or what? What right they have to imprison me here? Right or no right... If you make Krakatit for us, you'll be a free man. I told you that you won't get Krakatit from me, even if you cut my head off! - Whose laboratory is it? Mr. Prokop's, Your Grace. - He didn't run away yet? He's just yelling. You could be mistaken. In such a case, we'll think about taking you elsewhere, Mr. Prokop. Why? Alright, I'll tell you. You're accused of espionage. And you'll be taken to the fortress in two days. If it doesn't work by fair means, it will work by foul. We don't play games with anybody. - And you call yourselves civilised? You behave like ordinary gangsters! A person who has Krakatit is dangerous to the public and as such, he belongs in custody. - But in that case, you will all blow up. Everyone will blow up. Let's run away together. - Where? To my home. - You surely have someone there. What's her name? - Annie. And there's also another girl, whose name I do not know. You see! I won't let you go. You won't run away, will you? Don't let me think now, darling. I'll be evil again. Let go of me. You didn't think you have a princess, did you? What are you saying? - I know. You wanted a princess from the very start. And I came. Do you think I'm sorry? On the contrary. - Shut up! If you were my equal, I could not be with you. But there's a difference between us. Do you understand? Can it be that you are so depraved? No, it isn't true. You mustn't believe me. I came because you wanted to run. But I don't want to be without you. Now you're lying again. You're lying all the time. - I am lying, but I love you. Madly. You can become famous if you make Krakatit, can't you? What did d'Hémon say? That dukes carried Darwin to his grave. Could you be as famous? Really? Wait for my funeral. - Will it be soon? It would be so wonderful if you were famous. Do it for me, will you? - Will you wait ten years? Ten years? Couldn't it be a little sooner? You know I'm not used to wait. Goodbye. I'll come for you! - You mustn't. I'll come myself in the evening. Mr. Prokop, the Princess... - Is she coming? She apologizes, but she has a bad headache and she sends this letter. You are to make a decision tonight. Darling, do everything so that I can truly be yours. W. In our country, also women are subject to military discipline. And the strictest discipline applies to the members of the princely house. Do not worry, I will do everything as necessary. You are wonderful, Your Grace. As I expected you to be. It is in a higher interest. Does it mean that I am not to meet with the man again? On the contrary! It is in the higher interest to bind the man to you as much as possible. Excuse me, Mr. Prokop. The Baron would like to have a few words with you. Come in. Sit down. Excuse the mess. What is it? - Explosives. - Oh, explosives. It's chloracid. Explosive choking chlorine. What can ignite it? - Impact. Well, I'm listening. Why are you putting it in your pockets? - Just for fun. Do you want to tell me something? It won't blow up, will it? I'm terribly afraid. I'll be careful. - I'd advise you to. But tell your people to keep out of my way. This is worse than a ton of ecrasite. Why don't you sit down and begin. Well, Mr. Prokop, what we've come to tell you is a very serious and discrete matter. The General Director will explain it to you. I have the pleasure of informing you of the wish of our military command to join our army with view to your private liabilities. What liabilities? I mean your relationship... Your interest. I did not confess any of my interests to you. Of course you didn't. Somebody powerful intervened, you see? We don't mind that you're a foreigner. All you need to do is file an application for citizenship. Aha. What did you say? Nothing, I only said "aha". - Aha. Everything is alright then. It's a fine career, isn't it? What's this? - A hand grenade. Hexanitrophenylmethylnitramin and bolt nuts. See how heavy it is. Shouldn't you be more careful? Of course, it's chlorargonate. Don't play with it. I can't help myself, but I have an unpleasant feeling of deterrence. Really? I had a feeling of deterrence when you threatened me with the fortress. Well, that's just about all, isn't it? A high rank will be confered upon you to award your merit. Isn't that so, sir? And in such a case, even a princess may shake hands with a soldier. Presuming of course that the military command will get... That you'll simply give them... What? Nothing more. Well. Who told you I care about? I trust you will do everything to deserve the marriage for which the Princess sacrificed her honour and turned down a hire to the throne. Quite correct. I told you that woman is of the finest breed. You ought to regard her highly. I... I have to do it, don't l? - You do not, but you should consider what your duty is. - It means I must! You've caught me unawares. So you think that I must. That's how it is then. Watch out! Alarm! Alarm! Watch out! The anarchist! Go, Marike. So this was your plan, wasn't it? You've set it up. - What are you saying? So this is what it was all about. To make me give you Krakatit, eh? You're planning a war. And I was to help you kill people! - I don't understand. Do you know what a war is? I've been in a war. I know what people can do. Do you know what Krakatit is? A million lives. For what? Not enough? Two million dead. That's a good match for a princess. It's worth to throw yourself away a little. I was such a fool. How dreadful! - Go. Go away! - Why did you do it? You have your own conception of honour. But you were terribly wrong. I'm no chevalier. I am a cobbler's son. An ordinary man, understand? I have no honour. Your honour. You can lock me up in the fortress and torture me! I won't do it! I won't give you Krakatit! I'm sorry for falling so low to Your Grace. Go! - What are you? Are you human at all? I'm waiting for you, come with me. Where? - Wherever you want. I want freedom. - Let's go then. Is the gate open? - It is. Halt! - Out of the way! What have you done? - Be quiet! Halt! Your passport, please. - I'm Ambassador d'Hémon. Why are your headlights off? Password? - Krakatit. Who is travelling with you? The permit, please. Just a moment. Don't shoot! Isn't he in agony, doctor? - No, but a crisis is approaching. Cardiolobeline. Who knows whether he'll make it till the morning. From now on I'll be your comrade Daimon. Where are you taking me? - You'll see. I'll introduce you to my people. The most powerful people from all over the world, with their followers. Riff-raff drove them out of their lands. And their programme? They want their power and assets back. They have 95 grams of your Krakatit. Our Saxon comrade brought it from Balttin. If only Carson knew that. For now, they are arguing about what to blow up first. Where did the victory of democracy bring you? To humiliation and hunger. To chaos and helplessness. Cultured nations are suffering. Because those predestined to rule were driven out by riff-raff! We have been chosen by providence to raise the chosen peoples from the ashes. And to show those inferior where their place is. We know how to rule, they know how to work. With such co-operation we can achieve the welfare which the riff-raff sought to steal from the world! He's so handsome! I'm sick of it. - Pay no notice to it. We have trained him to fanaticize the people against democracy. We need war so that ammunition factories thrive. Come. Comrades, I bring someone before you. Comrade Krakatit. Let comrade Krakatit speak! Where is your Krakatit? Where did you put it? That's good. Let him speak! Comrade Krakatit is a man of action. He wants to unleash a war against the whole world. To decimate human kind with a single explosion and to rule the world! I've never wanted that. You'd be a fool to give up your invention. Quiet! Comrade Krakatit has the actual power to carry out such an explosion. Comrade pilots have envelopes with instructions where to disperse Krakatit! Get ready for take-off in half an hour! Hail our Fuerer Krakatit! - Krakatit! War! Mr. d'Hémon is lying! I don't want war! Get back! Or I'll throw it under your feet! No one will move! Mezierski wants to shoot me! I'll throw it! Quiet! I give orders when I hold this in my hands. I don't care if I die. Nobody will leave! Well. We will speak now. - Yes, we will speak now. Krakatit! It will explode! Lock the door! - I want to go with you. Aren't you... Do you know Jiri Tomes? I don't remember them all. Why did you tell such lies? - I told what they wanted to hear. Stop. - In a moment. Now listen to me. In your hands you have the means to blow up all the world's superpowers. Krakatit. And I have what they call the secret radio station. Which ignites your Krakatit within a distance of 3,000 kilometres. This station is at your disposal. It's up there on the ore dump. Our station. Do you see it? It's standing on 50,000 tons of magnesite. A natural condensator, you see? - How did it get here? What? - The house. It's been standing here for years. What about it? Never mind. It looks like my lab at home. It only appears that way. There's nobody there. The telegrapher is with the others. Open the door, you have the key. It's just like home. It's not very cozy. Our telegrapher is an oddball. What do you say to the instruments? This is our extension station which transmits the anti-waves. The artificial magnetic storms or how you call it. That's my whole secret. Report. - Hello. All the airplanes have landed safely at their positions. Everything is ready. I repeat: all the airplanes have... Who is it? Don't you recognize her? It's the beautiful woman who embraced you a while ago. Fabulous, isn't she? Could you turn on the big button? In the middle. Come, I'll show you something. Look over there. Can you see anything? - Nothing. No, wait. I see a faint glow. Do you know what it is? Done. Good night, comrades. Don't you understand? The explosion has reached us only now. A fifty kilometre crow-fly distance. Two minutes and a half precisely. What explosion? - Krakatit. The idiots put it in matchboxes. And you... - It was impossible to work with them. Now you take it in hand. Listen. Do you see? There and there. European capitals are on fire. Blown up. There's Balttin. It vanished off the face of the earth. My planes have dispersed Krakatit and you ignited it. You've just unleashed a war against the whole world. War? We've interrupted all wireless connections. Telegraphers hear nothing but cracking. And meanwhile, Mr. Tomes is toiling to make Krakatit. Where is Jiri? - At the Grottup Powder House. A 100 kilometres from here. He won't succeed. And even if he did, it would explode in his hand. Our station is working. Now you can control Krakatit yourself. Will you play the game? What do you mean by that? With Krakatit and the station you hold the world at bay. You'll dictate contributions, laws, borders. Whatever crosses your mind. Why would I do that? - Because you can. Energy must be discharged. Do not save anyone, work in large. There are billions of lives in the world. You'll be the first man who can deem the whole world as his laboratory. You can destroy it or enslave it. As you wish. You shall be Providence itself. You've deceived me, you demon. I don't want war. I don't want to cause new millions to die. There must be no war! There must be no Krakatit! You fool! Hello! - What do you want? I can't let you in. Is Mr. Tomes still here? What do you want from him? - I need to speak to him. Mr. Tomes is in the laboratory, you can't speak to him now. Tell him his old friend Prokop is waiting here for him. That he has something for him. - Stand back from the fence. Is it you, Tomes? - No, I'm the lab assistant. Mr. Tomes can't come, he's got important work to do. What do you want? - I must speak to him at once. It's not possible. Mr. Tomes is very busy today. I have to warn him. I have to deliver him something. You are to give it to me. - No, I'll give it only to him. In that case, you are to keep it. - Wait! Give it to him. Tell him... tell him that... Tell him that I need to speak to him. I want to know the girl's name. - He said you shouldn't wait. He can't be distracted from his work. - Damn it! Tell him to stop or it will blow up, understand? Mr. Tomes knows what to do. We'll be ready in 15 minutes. Good night. - Tell him not to turn the high frequency on! Tell him to stop! Or something... Hurry up! He doesn't know that d'Hémon... For Chrissake, stop him! - Hands up! Beware, Tomes. Take me with you, please. Is it you, Prokop? I've been waiting for you. - I'm coming. I was running so fast. - You're all off your feet, aren't you? Sit on the driver's box. Do you know that Grottup blew up too? And how many people were killed back then. More than 5,000 people died. It was a terrible disaster. You're all wet, you'll catch a cold. Let's get going. Gee! Uncle? Why did it all happen to me? What? Why did I have to meet with so many things? What one meets, comes from one's inside. That's not true. Why did I ran away from Tynice when I felt so good there? Why did I meet the Princess? I was looking for the other one, wasn't l? And it came all the same. Why? Tell me. It was your pride. It was in you. Even your invention. How do you call it? - Krakatit. It was a terrible explosive. It could destroy the whole world. And why? What is such an explosion good for? Find something what would drive another thing. To make the work of people easier. Do you understand? Do you mean some kind of inexpensive fuel? Cheap, inexpensive. Something quite useful. Something that would give light and heat, you know? Wait... I'd have to start from the end. That's just it! Start from the end and that's that. To give light and heat. You're right. Why haven't I thought of it before? - There, you see? Invent something what would help people. And not kill people. Then it will be a great invention. I'll try again. Something that gives light and heat. He doesn't need oxygen. He is breathing normally. He calmed down. He must have suffered, poor man.
