You can't put off looking at universities any longer, Pavan. - But I... - Your Uncle Deepak will be here any minute. Now, don't make him wait. - Mum, please. - No, we agreed you would help him today. You know how important seva is, Pavan. Seva. Work offered to God. Ancient India. Love for yourself, love for your family. Feeding people. Ha, you like this music, huh? Straight from the heart of India, via California. Hey, it's around here somewhere. I'm right, I'm always right, showtime! Now remember, these people are in mourning. Show some respect. Shit. Ready to help your old uncle, huh? Daada-ji is right. You need pulling into shape. My boy too. You know, my father is a wise man, you should listen to him. Both of you, okay. You help me unload the food. You follow my directions exactly, you touch nothing. Hey, nothing, right? Your dad's weird, like schizo. What's wrong with your family? Shut up, he's your family too. Anyway, you live with Daada-ji, talk about weird. He's like a recluse, no one ever sees him. He just works hard. - Shut up. - What'd I tell you, huh? Come on. Hey, what did I tell you? Touch nothing! But they're always banging on about health and safety at college, like leaving a candle unattended. I understand what you were doing. What disappoints me is that my own grandchild knows so little about his own heritage. We were going to ground you from your science museum trip but we don't want to stop you learning. Oh come on, Pavan. Does nothing upset you? Make you happy? I mean, you must care about something. There's a whole world of experience out there just waiting for you. Get involved! Your father was such a passionate man. I want to see that in you. I just don't get it. Look, it's not complicated. Seva's an important part of the culture. It's Indian tradition. Yeah, but our family left India. They just kept the weird rituals. And who cares about a stupid candle? Dude, that candle has to burn solidly for 11 days after the person dies 'cause the light guides the dead on their journey into the next life. They must've done it at your house after your dad died. I don't remember. How do you know so much about it? Been to a few with my dad now. Just have to listen and ask. Guys, this place would be sick for my routine. All the ladies lined up watching me do my thing. Excuse me, excuse me. Firstly, don't get too close. Second, what is that? Rick James, Super Freak. It's a classic. No, that shit is very old. He's wrong. All right, boys, what's the plan. Well, we didn't even finish the science exhibit, so... Hey guys, take a look at this. Oh, hi. How you doin'? - Bye. - Oh, check it out. It's a '70s exhibition, we've gotta go to this. Ah, I'm suppose to be studying. You know, I've heard about this '70s thing. Yeah, they've got a roller rink. That means more girls like her. Pav, you may be the family genius but I need to pass my exams to get into uni. Look, I don't care. I want to meet girls. I want to meet girls. Come on, listen, the talent's gettin' away. Meet girls. Right, so where's she gone? ♪ Heaven must be missing an angel ♪ ♪ Missing one angel, child ♪ ♪ 'Cause you're here with me right now ♪ ♪ Your love is heavenly ♪ That's her from the flyer. ♪ Heavenly to me, baby ♪ She's amazing. You all right, Pav? All right, guys, we should actually give this a go. I'm game. Yeah, all right. ♪ I want all I can get ♪ Got a piece, huh. Oh, oh! Go then. Right, I'm gonna go yeah, three. Look at all those people around her. She must be somebody. It's really a celebration of that era so you'll see all aspects of it. The design, the fashion, and of course, the amazing music. I've gotta talk to her. Mate, a lady like that only understands numbers, not words. All right, so. I'm going. No, leave it. Well, thanks for joining us. It sounds wonderful. I'll see you on the dance floor. Uh-huh, and thank you so much. All right, seriously. Yeah? Be honest. You're not related, are you? I ask myself the same question every day. Can I have a selfie, please? Oh, of course. Wow, she is freakin' amazing. You all done then yeah, lover boy? Come on. What do you mean, come on? You can't follow her. Where's your sense of adventure? What, in skates, you think I'm gonna roll there? Come on! You can't skate anyways. Oh cheers, mate, cheer, mate! Pav, what're doing? She's gonna see us. Hello, did we have a change of plan? I came by to pick you up. Sorry, I felt like walking. Thank God for that. We were so close. Well, you have been saved from making a tit of yourself. And there probably are other ways to get girls that don't involve stalking. Can we call it a day now, huh? Have that ice cream, it's amazing. - Of course. - They don't like ice cream. Pavan? Pavan! What are you two giggling about? Now, either share the secret or just shut up and eat. Seeking the 70s. There she is. I'm here at the LMA Museum's colorful new exhibition, Seeking the 70s with model and actress, Stephanie Crane. Stephanie, perhaps you can tell us a bit more about what people can expect to experience - Stephanie. - When they go Seeking the 70s. - Hi, sure, well it's. - Wait, is that the same as Saturday Night Fever? Saturday Night Fever. Stephanie. Maybe I could be Tony. So, Stephanie. I'd like to take you out for a dance. Da, dance, da-da. Stephanie. You look good, no. Steph, Steph, Stephanie, maybe I could take you out for a Frappuccino, a mocaccino. A loveaccino, yeah, they make those now. I can make you a loveaccino. Yeah, cool, you know... Who's the lucky girl that's won herself such a twat? Get out, man! You know, when puberty kicks in, you might just pull that off. - Ow! - Hey, leave him alone, you big bully. Oh, I'm only having a laugh. He's my little brother, I'm supposed to terrorize him. Go on you, you're wanted in the other room. By who? Go! You're all right. Big brothers, eh? Can you help me with something? Huh? So what you looking for? It's your dad's gold ring. Sunil said it's in here somewhere. He wants to wear it at our wedding. Why can't he look for it? Come on, squirt, help me, will you? Wish I could have met your dad. Reckon he was a right character. Must have been to make two lads like you and Sunil. You miss him? Sometimes. Eh, up. What are these? Oh, my dad's old records. He used to play them when I was little. Why don't you set it up? What about your ring? Go on, I'll find it. You go.

Wake up, Pavan! You know the rule, breakfast before you leave. Beta, come eat, Pavan. I'm coming! Oh, Pavan! I'm coming. Fell asleep with the light on again? When you get home, we have to choose a university for you, okay? Daada-ji! Are you going to listen to your mother? - Yeah. - Good. Remember, seva tonight. No, I helped Uncle Deepak, that counts as seva. Seva is never finished. Beta, it's bowling night, and they're expecting you. It's about helping others, is that so hard? No, it's an ancient Indian custom. We live in London and you wanna live like we're still in India. It doesn't make sense! It's not that simple, Pavan. We're lucky to live where we do but our traditional values are also important. I'm gonna be late for college. - Pavan. - I'm late! Don't worry about it. In terms of evolutionary assets and elements that differentiate humans from other mammals, and indeed, all animals in the animal kingdom, self-awareness is generally cited as the answer. But, in fact, There are several species... Where you been? Fell asleep on the bus. Bellend. Have this awareness, mostly primates. Found out who she is. Are you still on that? Bonobo. She's an actress and a model. Right, exactly. Exactly. No. I mean exactly why you've got no chance of meeting her. I've already met her. Danny's right, you've lost it. Danny's just jealous that I've found the perfect girl. Regarding itself in a mirror. Jealous? Becomes aware that it's looking not at. Do you think Danny has any problems? Oi! And there have been many examples of animals using mirrors to preen themselves. Strongly suggesting... You gonna ask her out? - What? - That they have an awareness of how they look to others. If you weren't brown, you'd be bright red. Shut up! And so the human is one of only 10 species to display signs of self-awareness. And if you two could do the same during my lecture, that would be very much appreciated. Sorry about that. You're a nobhead. What did I do? Kristen's gonna think I like her. You do like her. Danny, they're just mates. Whatever, it's cool. Look, if I give up on Stephanie, I won't get anywhere with her. You haven't got anywhere with her. But I will, and that's the point. Look, I just wanna do well on my exams and get to uni, that's all. You should be doing the same. ♪ I'm your boogie man, that's what I am ♪ ♪ Mm-Mm ♪ ♪ Whatever I can ♪ Stop! ♪ Be it early morning, oh ♪ Careful, you'll have someone's eye out. Bloody hell. Danny. Yeah. Girls like you, yeah? Uh, well. You're cool, you can move. I need your help. When I meet Stephanie, I wanna impress her. Maybe take her to a restaurant, buy flowers, champagne... Wait, wait, wait. I mean, it's lovely but they're all very much out of date, so. It's classy. You saw her on the rink. I wanna be in control on that dance floor. Look, that's how I'm gonna win her over. Hold on, hold on. So now, you wanna be a dancer? Mate, you just need to chill. A lady likes a man who's relaxed. Not too much effort, just chill. I'm chill, I'm chill. I'm so chill, I'm... Cold? Yeah? Okay, I just wanna be ready. Will you help me out? I've got rehearsal now but find me after and we'll try and make you a little less dangerous, yeah? You're the best. Sorry. Don't touch me, what you doing? Hey, I'm Pavan. What's your name? Tara. Nice name, nice name. Do you recognize her? Don't you recognize her? Stephanie Crane. She's an actress and a model. I mean, she does loads of photo shoots and interviews and stuff. Oh, she's just, she's basically a superstar. She's probably at a glamorous photo shoot right now, actually. She's super talented. She's a real good dancer, actually. My friend Danny's gonna teach me some moves. Maybe I'll ask her to dance. She'll be so impressed. Do you reckon she'll join? Daada-ji, I'm really sorry. I know it's not what you want but, I just, I just don't think it's the right decision. Look, I don't wanna go to university, don't make me. I wanna do anything else but go, anything else. I mean, well maybe not anything else. I don't even like science. Four years of doing a subject you don't like. Daada-ji, can you imagine doing something you don't like for four years of your life? Did, did you even go to university? Maybe I can open an art gallery. Okay, would you wanna make me unhappy, Daada-ji? Because a sad child is worse than an uneducated child. Why don't I get a say in this? Why are you deciding what I do with my life? Please, Daada-ji, I don't wanna go to univer. I don't wanna do it. Please, just hear me out this one time, please. ♪ She's a very freaky girl ♪ So you didn't chicken out then? No, man, let's do this. Okay, can we change this music first though, 'cause I. ♪ She will never let your spirits down ♪ This is funky. It's funky but can we just, a bit more moderner. Well, yeah. All right. ♪ She likes the boys in the band ♪ You'll like this one. Works! What's cookin'? You can't do that. Why can't I do that? You shouldn't do that. Yeah? Let's go. Yeah, let's, we can funk it up a little bit. I know you like that funky stuff so just maybe. No, no, no, chill, chill. You need to have flavor. No, Pav, flavor. Hello? What? What you doing? What do you mean? Mate, you're just here pissing about. I'm trying to help you. Lighten up, mate, we're just having some fun. Yeah, we're having fun but I've got stuff to do, yeah? You don't even wanna dance, do you? You just wanna impress this chick, eh? So? So, I actually take this seriously. You see, I'm passionate about this stuff. Maybe you should think about it. I don't know what you're passionate about. I don't care what you do, that's not my problem. No, no, that's why we have a contract. You can't change your mind like this. What am I supposed to do with a thousand copies of Pottery Enthusiast? Shouldn't you be in college? Finished, Daada-ji. - No, not you. - It's 4:30. Yeah. Look, Pavan, I'm very busy. No, that's not the point. How many years of good service have you had from me? I actually want to talk to you about something. Yes, I know what, you've come to apologize. Good, a man must admit when he's wrong. Did you hear that? Actually. Look, I'm not bothered, I'm old. I've grown a thick skin. Yes, thick skin. How else do I deal with imbeciles like you. Who do you think you are? Look, Pavan, what? Sorry, Pavan, I can't talk now. Your mother is the one you must apologize to. Yeah. Now, you listen to me, you little money skunk. I'm sorry for yelling at you and walking out. It's okay, beta. We all blow our tops once in a while. Beta, you know it's only because we love you, hmm? We want you to be happy. We want you to find a passion in life and we want you to be involved. I suppose I have to go to bowling, then. Do that for Daada-ji. It'll make him think you're engaging in life. Would you rather I was studying? I want you to do everything, like I do. And now, scarper, I've got lots to do. I want to talk about university. Great, let's do that after dinner, okay? What's that? Oh, it's just a science magazine. I'm gonna wash up for dinner. Ashita, Neelum, Nimisha, come everyone, come. Thought we were having dinner? Let's get God's blessing first. We'll have dinner afterwards. I'm starving. Try this. And have you tried this chutney, Daada-ji? I have, I have, thank you. So, what's with the prayers, Daada-ji? You've never done that before. Well, we're surrounded by British culture. What's wrong with sharing some Indian culture? It's good for the soul. Still got to worship a tea light. Hey, stop eating so fast, you'll get indigestion. I'm going, I've gotta get going. To see his girlfriend. Shut up. We saw you drooling over the photos on your phone. Pavan's in love. Stop it, all of you. Pavan, who is she? You know she's a hottie if she's turned this stud-muffin's head! Leave him. I'm gonna be late. Are you off to the community center? Okay, well, I've got rehearsal, I'll come with you. All right. Yeah but, hang on. We were supposed to talk about universities. Pavan. See ya. Why has Daada-ji suddenly got us praying? He's just trying to instill some sense of tradition into us all, you know, culture. And look how happy it makes him. Anyway, you're lucky. I never got much of that back home. Just don't get it. Well, I think he's doing a pretty good job. You know, he's seen a lot in his life, has Daada-ji. All right, come and see me when you're done. I'm literally only next door rehearsing and there are tons of pretty girls in my dance troupe. Pavan. I'm only trying to help, you big goat. You must be Pavan. Great, I could really use your help. I'm Aarti. Aarti? Yeah, yeah, my name means worship. What does Pavan mean? Just a name. Okay, well, it's great that you could help. Had to do seva, didn't I? Oh, no, don't worry, it'll be a real easy night. It'll go by in a flash. You know how to bowl, right? Mm. You'll be all right. Go on. Put those bowling pins back. ♪ I wanna put on my, my, my, my, my boogie shoes ♪ ♪ Just boogie with you, yeah ♪ Do you have a girlfriend? Yeah, I do. Her name's Stephanie, she's a model, and she's beautiful. ♪ I wanna put on my, my, my, my, my boogie shoes ♪ ♪ Just boogie with you ♪ ♪ Yeah, I wanna put on, my, my, my, my boogie shoes ♪ Ready? This is the championship. Hooray! ♪ My, my, my, my boogie shoes ♪ You did great. Actually looked like you were enjoying yourself at one point. Well, making little kids cry always does bring a smile to my face. That was a joke. Hey, Aarti. Hey. How'd he get on? Yeah, really good. All charm. Actually made an impression on one of the younger girls. You should've seen her face when she found out her was spoken for. Really? So you have got a girlfriend. Why do I not know about this? Shall we get going? Well, I've gotta help Aarti lock up but I'll see you at the house. Pavan. Come. Come, sit. Sit, sit. How was your evening? Fine? You know, I'd really like to hear about this girlfriend of yours. I don't have a girlfriend. But there's someone you like. It's just a girl, we've barely spoken. The girls said you have pictures of here. Can I see? No, I just saw her skating the other day. Then? I said hello. That's about it. Is she in your classes? No. Then who is she? Come on, let me see. How old is she? Why? I ask because I'm worried about your studies and so is your mother. Your education is so important. What's that got to do with anything? I want you to have the opportunities that your father and I never had. The best tool you can have is a good education. It'll set you free. What if I don't wanna go to uni? Well, maybe you want to come and work with me like Sunil did. You might want to take on the business someday. Either way, you're not gonna have much time for a girl like this. A girl like this? You mean a white girl? That's not what I said. Why are you twisting my words? It's what you meant, though. No matter what I do, I'm always wrong. Always bringing shame on this family. Unbelievable! How do you think it feels to have a grandfather who's a racist? No! How dare you? Who are you to talk to me like that? You're living in my house. Not anymore. Well, go then. Piss off! Oi. That's not very nice, ya little tart. Could have been your mum. What's going on? Sunil said it sounded like World War III kicked off. I know Daada-ji can be a handful sometimes, like we said. He's just tryin' to look out for you. I'm going. Why don't you come down and have a chat with your brother? Look, the coast is clear. Make just a couple of minutes. Okay, so you and Daada-ji had a barney. All right, it happens. But I really don't think it's 'cause this girl you like is white. You didn't see him. All right. Well, the answer's simple then, innit? Date an Indian girl. All right, sorry, British-Asian. What? He's old school. You always get what you want. Yeah, but I know how to make what I want look like what Daada-ji wants. You just gotta learn how to handle him. Anyway, for starters, who is this girl, huh? Someone from college? She's older. An actress. But, I've only met her once, but that's not the point. It is the point. An actress? What she got to do with your world? There's plenty of stunning girls your age who would love to go out with a guy like you. Look, I told you there's plenty at my dance group. Look, and they might even, they might even happen to be Asian. Look, why do you think Nimisha and me are getting married? So Nimisha doesn't have to go back to Liverpool? Oi! No, no. 'Cause there's no way I was gonna let the perfect girl get away. That's enough of that. And the fact that Daada-ji wants it as well is just a bonus, bro. So if he wanted you two to split up, would you? No way. I'd be with her anyway. It's none of his damned business. My point exactly, thank you. Wait, what? No, but this is different somehow. Pavan, wait, where you gonna go? - Look. - What? I think I have an idea. I had a fight with Daada-ji. Walked out. What, you've run away? I'm not a kid, I've left. Where you going? No, not here, you can't. You're my cousin. What do you want me to say, man? Our cat's got depression. You haven't got a cat. Yeah, and no, that's... Look, Daada-ji called my dad. He said he wants you home. Go home, Pav, it's best. I'm sorry, man. Do you have any idea where he could be? I bet you anything I can find him. How do you even know where to look? Well, if I know my brother, he won't do anything without consulting his cousin first. He'll be around here somewhere. Oi, oi, just over there. How'd you find me? I knew you'd go straight to Uncle D's. Wouldn't let you in, eh? Gonna hit the West End. Cheer you up. Got your favorite jacket in the car. Or, I could just leave you here, standing on the side of the road like Billy no mates, so. No, no, wait, wait. Yeah. Right, bro. We're gonna have a boogie. Put a smile back on that face. Oh, and, here. You went in my room? Ssh, come on, just put it on. Now? Yes. Where are we even going? It had better be somewhere decent not where you oldies like to go. Just wait and see. What kind of music is it? Something different. I've just gotta make a quick stop. Why is she going in here? Just five minutes. Just be patient. Does five minutes Indian time involve two hours? In Indian time? Are we in India? - Why are we... - Don't. I know exactly. For goodness sake, Where were you gonna go anyway, by the way, on your own? What's it to you? I'm an adult. Just walking off on your own. I can do what I want. Why don't you find some friends? I've got loads of friends. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're married now. You don't even know what a friend is. I saw all of them when I picked you up. Oh, go on, can you just tell her to hurry up? She's taking ages. She's takin' ages, she's takin' ages. Right, I need your help with something real quick. - Jump out. - No, no, no. You said five minutes. Yeah, jump out, come on. Five minutes, come on. What is this? What do you mean what is it? What are they doing? What's it look like they're doing? Come on. Where you going? Leave me alone. Don't worry, come on. Pavan. It's fine, it's okay. Don't worry. Good try. Danny. How's it going? All right, just on my way home. Look, can we talk? Sure, where are ya? I'm on Wardour Street. All right. What's going on? What the fuck you looking at? He looks like ISIS. He's probably got a fucking bomb. Leave me alone. Shut the fuck up unless you really wanna get hurt. Fucking! Come on, then. Oi! We was just havin' some fun! Well fuck off and have it somewhere else then. Pav, you all right? Come on, get up. Pav, been looking everywhere for you. Danny said he was meeting you. Come on, we've gotta get you to the hospital. I'm fine. I know you are, squirt. It's Daada-ji. What? Come on. Sorry, the doctor's with him now. If you'd like to take a seat out there. We'll let you know. My God, what happened to you? I'm fine. How's Daada-ji? They're checking him over. What happened? His heart. You know how emotional he is. He got all worked up about something and then keeled over. It's my fault, isn't it? If I hadn't of stormed out. Hey, don't do that, mate. My fault he's here. You can't think like that. Daada-ji's a passionate person, he gets worked up. It's not your fault. So, he's stabilized. We're keeping an eye on him, but we won't know much more about his progress until tomorrow. Can we see him? Give us a couple of minutes, but yeah, of course. Just no excitement, okay? We're all here, Daada-ji. Is there anything we can do? Now he's comfortable so, all I can suggest is to go home and try and get some rest and we'll talk again in the morning. Look, I'll give you a couple of minutes, okay? Thank you. Sorry about before. You were just trying to help, and I... Forget it. It's not important, we're cool. Mate, if there is anything else I can do, just, well, you know where I am. We'll get going soon. Misha's taken the others back in the car. I'm staying. Pav. He'll be okay. Well, you know how strong he is. I realize, things have been tricky with you and him. Okay, you're not to blame. Seems like I always do the wrong thing. That's just being a teenager. I've been there. I did all right. And you're the great brown hope. They just want the best for you. How come I can't do anything right? Just don't stress. You'll get there. You know, this place reminds me of where they had dad in. You're probably too young to remember. I was starting to forget what dad was like. I don't wanna forget. You were only little. Come on, we should get some rest. Called us a cab. Pavan. You know you look like dad when you pull that face. All right, I called me a cab. You can look after him tonight, eh?

Do you wanna go and feed the ducks in the park with your boyfriend or do you want to be a success? Gerry, just give me the phone. Gerry. Gerry! Delete. No more Adam, no more nobody. No room in the diary. Now we've got a busy day, so finish making yourself look beautiful. We're joined by Stephanie Crane in the studio. Hi. Sounded great. This week is crazy. It's mental. It's all about building momentum. Getting you out there. Gonna be keeping you very busy. Which is great. When is there some time to let our hair down, eh? You what? I think we've got enough there. Yeah, Derek. I booked you 'cause you're the best. I think we can do better. I wanna go again, I think you can get more out of her. Okay. Okay, Steph, just a few more. Just a couple more on the end of the roll. Let's have a bit of energy. Let's really sell it. Come on, sell it. Gerry, it can't all just be work, work, work. I think you may be at the wrong party. There's Kristen. Go on, talk to her. Has our boy got a thing for Kristen? Leave it alone. She likes you. She's always chatting to you. The only reason we chat is 'cause she's got a mate in my dance class. It's not like a... A thing. If you want something to happen, then you've gotta act. Look at me and Stephanie. Oh, yeah, let's look at that. She doesn't even know your name. Rude. Plus, I'm working on it. Easier for you. Kristen already knows who you are. Why do you care? 'Cause I wanna help you. And it takes my mind of everything. Oh, piss off. Easy. I ain't a pity case to make you feel better about yourself. What? Look, I hate that Daada-ji's not well, yeah, and I know it's harder for you 'cause you live with him but I'm not a fucking guinea pig. That's not what I... Listen, don't use me as a distraction. Wait. It's not your week, mate. It's just so beautiful. You made this? My mother taught me when I was a girl. This one, I made especially for my wedding. Maneesh loved colorful things. And now. No. - Yes. - Really? Mm-hmm. Oh! It's beautiful, beta. Oi, oi. What do you think? Your mum made this. She married your dad in it. When I wear it, I officially become your big sister. It's a proper Indian veil. How can you tell the difference? Well, why don't you come out into the light and I'll show you the difference. Okay. Trust me, you only find quality like this in India. It's so beautifully made. You been traveling? Hmm, yeah, after my exams, I just went. I wanted to see some of my ancestry so I traveled 'round India for a bit. What's it like? A lot of it's very poor. I mean, you realize how lucky you actually are but it's so beautiful. Rich, colorful. The people are amazing. There's something kind of honest about it. Not all of it, obviously, but I loved it. And after that, I went to Thailand, Vietnam, Bali and you can live like a king out there for next to nothing. Then, when I got back, I just wanted a fresh start. So, I packed my bags, moved to London and within a week, I met your brother and everything just fell into place.

I found inner peace. Oh, I've not seen these. You look different. Oh, we were young. That was taken just after we came here. I was about your age. I remember that party. It was Uncle Deepak's 21st. So, Dad and Daada-ji, they look happy. Ah, they were always happy. Dreamers, both of them. So, you and Dad came over with Daada-ji? A-ha, we wanted a fresh start after your grandmother died. It wasn't easy. We all worked hard. I started teaching. Uncle Deepak started his catering business and your dad did many different jobs until eventually, he was able to start the printworks. And then, when he. Your Daada-ji insisted on taking over the business. It was hard for him, at his age but, you know, it saved the family. Your sisters were just babies at that time. I hadn't even thought about what will happen to the business if... Oh. That's how I remember your father. He loved to dance! He looks like something out of Saturday Night Fever. Exactly! Wait Ta-da! I remember this tape. I actually watched some clips of it online the other day. He used to play it all the time. Even when I was pregnant with you. Drove me mad. Oh, and you know before that, it was James Dean, Rebel Without a Cause. He was obsessed with those old American cars. His big dream was to design his own classic car. I wish I'd known him better. I've been learning about the Chandigarh region. It's where Dad's from, right? Ha, we both grew up around there. Uncle Deepak and your father were born in the same house as Daada-ji. Can we do something for Daada-ji? Maybe light a candle? Bring me the Hanuman Chalisa. Do you remember the story? A little. It talks about Sri Hanuman's devotion to his master, Sri Rama. An embodiment of devotion and sacrifice. Through reciting its verses, we will pray for Daada-ji's recovery, okay? How will I understand it? You read and I'll translate. - Okay. - Come on. Very good. With the dust of Guru's lotus feet, I clean the mirror of my mind and then narrate the sacred glory of the Sri Ram Chandra. The supreme among the Raghu dynasty. The giver of the four attainments of life. Knowing myself to be ignorant, I urge you, O Hanuman, the son of Pavan. Hello, Parathi Printworks. Yes, yeah Yes, hello? Hello? It's ringing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, one second. Hello? One second. Stephanie Crane, up-and-coming actress and model has Hollywood knocking at her door with two major roles in the offing. We might soon be losing her though as the young starlet considers a complete relocation. One things for certain, England's loss will be Hollywood's gain. In the meantime, fans might glimpse Stephanie this Saturday as she makes a celebrity appearance at London's prestigious Club Shiva. - Shiva. - That's all from entertainment corner. Now across to Charles Taylor... Club Shiva. With the weather. Hey. Hey, Kristen. You all right? Yeah, are you? I heard your grandfather isn't well. How's he doing? They don't know. He's hanging in there so far, so. I hope he'll be okay. I usually see you with Pavan. And you're mates with Danny. Right, yeah. You're not mates with Danny? Yeah, yeah. Girls are always talking to me to find out about Danny. I was just with him. He's actually got his eye on one of my mates. Oh. So how come you're not with Pavan? You two must need each other. Oh, you know. You should make up, talk. It's important to tell people how you feel. Come in. I came to say I'm sorry. About all that with Kristen. I know you were only trying to help. I shouldn't have pushed it. Were you praying? What you reading? Hanuman Chalisa. Sri Hanuman Chalisa. You know it? Yeah, dad likes to talk while he works. Been learning a lot about my dad lately. He had some amazing dreams. I just wish he had more time. Stephanie's gonna be at Club Shiva this weekend and then she's gonna move to America and she's she'll be gone. I need to see her again. Pav, I don't think that's a good idea. I don't know about university and I don't know about work and look, I know that Daada-ji's unwell, I know. But this is my last chance. I need your help. Club Shiva? I think I can help. Is this your mum's car? Do you want a ride or what? Come on, it's better than the bus. My dad supplies all Club Shiva's food and drink. He's got a major ice delivery going there this Saturday. And you're gonna talk to him about it? No, you are. Ah, my boys. Come to cause more mischief, huh? I don't know this one. Dad, our mate Danny. The dancer. Oi! Oh, yeah, dancing boy, of course. Daada is doing better now. He's awake. You visited him? Yeah. My boy says you want my help. Something to do with Club Shiva. You know who Shiva is, yes? The Hindu god with a club named after him? In his incarnation as Nataraja, Shiva is the Lord of the Dance, yes. If you seek to know, you will find a way to know. What are you after? What is it, illegal? Spit it out, boy! I need to meet a girl at Club Shiva before she moves to America and I lose her forever. Girl? It's my last chance to win her over. She's making a special appearance there on Saturday. So you mean to win the girl of your dreams, huh? She will swoon into your arms and you will whisk her away to some golden future, huh, huh? This is what you interrupt my day for? Pipe dreams, crazy schemes? I'm sorry, Dad. You see, this is why I am so proud of my family. My nephew, he has a crazy idea with absolutely no chance of success but look in his eyes. Nothing is going to stop him, huh. I'm so proud of you, Pavan. You remind me of your father and I. Fearless, intrepid, stupid even. Yeah, stupid. Always driving Daada-ji crazy with our antics. Now, what do you need? Right, so when we're there, I'll tell you what to do. Okay, what are we gonna do? I'll tell you when we're there. I can't believe my dad said, yeah, you know. It's kind of cool. It's kind of crazy. Excuse me, excuse me. Just see that there's a bike, yeah. Okay, oh, Jesus. Yeah, I can see, Danny. I've got my own eyes. Whoa, whoa, whoa, swerve to the right. I'm not gonna, shut, you can't even drive! Dude, you can't drive. I've got eyes. Anyway, any questions? Yeah, why am I wearing this flipping outfit? All done, you two go in. I'll park the van and meet you in there. Hmm? Man. That's the last of it. Just need your signature. Oh, yeah, it was a three-man job, was it? Yeah, thanks. Three hours till they open. Let's do this. This one. One each. Gotta leave some free. I can't believe we have to share a bloody cubicle! Keep it down, you two. Listen. Gone. Danny Yeah? Thanks for doing this, man. Yeah, yeah, it's fine. What is that smell? I can't smell anything. Sorry. - Oh. - Oh, my God. Wow. What have you got in this bag? Open it, open it. Oh, sexy Stephanie is going to fall all over me. Look how sexy is that? Pav, please. We're almost there, just be quiet. I'm talking about my sexy shoes. These sexy shoes? She's gonna leave you before she's even got with you. Oi, listen. What? Can you not? What? You hear the bass. Wait, the club. Wait, there's music. Wait, shush. Stop talking so you can listen. Shit, the lights. Danny What? Love you, man.

Hmm, whatever you're gonna say, I think you might have to say it to both of them. There'll be something. There's always a couple. Seriously, what is their problem? Will you chill out? They're not hurting anyone. I'll just make sure. I've got an idea. All right, give me a sec. Tony. Can I help you, ladies? Where I come from, stalking is frowned upon. But we haven't done anything. Yeah, you keep that up and I'll slap your eyes round the back of your head. All right? Absolutely. Okay, time to go. He's gonna kick the shit out of us so let's make a move now. No, no, we're not leaving. This is my last chance to get close to her. Well, I know how you can get close. I just spoke to the DJ and if you really wanna impress her, I know how. Come on. What?

How did you find us? Where is she? Look, you're just her manager. She can do what she wants. How does any of that have anything to do with you? What did you think was gonna happen, son? Do you think a girl like that is gonna roll over for some kid? Stephanie is incredible. Look, it was my last chance. I wasn't gonna let her get away. Sometimes, you've just got to get what you want in life. You sound like me. I say that to my clients. You want something, you go and get it. But it doesn't work with girls. How old are you, 17? 18. Student? Stephanie's a grown up and a professional. She's going right to the top or as near as, dammit. She's gonna be working and traveling non-stop. How does someone like that have time for someone like you? It's a fantasy. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just not gonna happen. How do you know what she's gonna have time for? You just want her for yourself. Now, don't be pushy. I'm being nice. You've got some balls, kid. That'll take you a long way. You just crapped out this time. No shame in it. There's no hard feelings either. Come on. Come on. Right, now if you'll excuse me, I've got to try and find my client. How are you gonna know where she is? A good manager always knows where his client is. Fuck's sake. Quick, get in! Go, go, go, go! I'm sorry for running off like that. I just can't deal with Gerry any more tonight. He's all right. He just gave me some advice. Advice? That you will be a superstar traveling the world and won't have time for a kid like me. Are you cold? Thank you. Could you take me to my mum's, please? Yeah, sure, where? Head for Ealing. Bishops Road. Thank you. You close with your mum? I just need a change of scene. Some time to think. I can't live my life like this anymore. You do yoga and stuff, right? Well, I've been reading up on it. And some of it comes from where my folks are from. Northern India? Chandigarh region. Capital of Punjab? Look, I only know because I've always admired Chandi, the Hindu goddess. Well, actually it's Parvati, her warrior side that I'm really drawn to. How do you know all this? Have you been? No, never but I've always been fascinated by it. You must have been though? Oh, God, I'd have been there in a shot if I had family connections. Doubt I'll ever have the time. We could always go. Oh, Pavan. You're a funny one. That does sound like an amazing trip, though. Really, you should, you should go. I don't think this van's gonna get us home. Yeah, it doesn't sound too good, does it? Nah. Oh, it's just here on the right. I reckon we'd have fun in India, you and me. Oh, you're so lucky. You've got it all ahead of you. You're gonna have the best time. Can I see you again? Pavan, we have very different lives. But you're going to make a wonderful boyfriend. You just need to find yourself a nice girl and you'll be away. Honestly, thank you so much for tonight. No, I actually had the best time. No, keep it. You You little charmer.

Thanks for last night, boys. All right, fair play. Didn't think you had it in you. Got a lot further than I thought you would. All right, fuck off. Boom. Hello? Welcome back, Daada-ji. Oh, thank you. Where were you? We got a call from the hospital saying Daada-ji was ready to come home! Oh, Pavan. Pavan, nice to see you. Oh, it's so nice to be home. Daada-ji, mum said we're gonna have a welcome home party. Oh, wonderful. Will you make me my favorite pakoras? Yes, yes? Yes. Chalo, chalo girls, come on, girls. We go as well. Daada-ji, see you in a minute. All right. Okay. Daada-ji, will you be more comfortable in the living room? Yeah, of course you will. Listen, help yourselves.

Daada-ji, can I speak to you please? Of course. I've been thinking about university. I don't wanna go. Well, not yet anyway. I want to go traveling. See where you and dad came from. Maybe visit mum's village. I can come back to study. I want this. It's wonderful. I mean that is wonderful! I wish I could go too. Maybe one day, we can go together. I'd like that. I never thanked you for staying with me. That meant a lot to me. Your father would have been so proud of you. And there is nothing like a good dance to make one feel better. What did I tell you? You're here to work. You're not out of trouble yet. Hello. That's my dad. He seems nice. Yeah, anyway, you want to take one? All right, see you in a bit. See you in a bit. That actually suits you, man. Too bad you don't look too hot in yours. Let me get to this. I'll go talk, go and talk. Not a bad turn out, eh? It's all right. Congratulations. Thanks. So you're really gonna go? Yeah. I'm so excited for you. You're gonna have the best time. Just say yes to everything and embrace it. Thanks, you're the best. Well, what are big sisters for?
