l AM LOVE Madam, your son told me he is bringing a guest. - A guest? - Yes. A girl... So, we have Gratieni and his wife here, Betta and Gregorio-- probably... here. - Between Edo and Delfina. - Yes. She should sit next to Edoardo. She doesn't know anyone. - ls Edo back? - Not yet. - Any news on the race? - He came in second. Second? The snow, Grandpa's birthday, Edo losing a race... Three events in just one day! Maybe this year we'll be spared Edo's dish. What do you say, Betta? Your sister's in a bad mood today. - What's for breakfast? - Thanks, lda. He's never this late. He must really like this girl! Hi, Anita. - Good morning, lda. - Good morning, Edoardo. - Good morning, Liliana. - Good morning, Mr. Edoardo. Here you are, my love. - Thanks for the soup, Mama. - l have to add some saffron. - Who is she? - Be nice to her, she's really shy. Her name is Eva. lda is a little jealous. Edo lost the race today. He'll have more time to concentrate on work. Good morning, Madam. Good morning, Sir. - How are you, lda? - Very well, thank you. And you? - You look well. - Thank you. Happy birthday. - Good morning. - How are you? Very well, Madam. And you? We've been through happier times. Look how they've grown. Grandpa! Elisabetta, how are you? Fine. - Nothing for me? - Happy birthday, Grandpa. They are here. When did you get back? l was a little late. Who did you lose to today? Gregorio? No, to a guy l don't know. l didn't lose, we tied. Why didn't you challenge the judge's ruling? He deserved the victory. l spoke to your brother this morning. lt's a pity you weren't there. Your grandfather's in an excellent mood today. - ls this Eva from the Ugolini family? - Yes, the poor side. Gianluca, you're even more of a snob than your father. More than your grandmother! Hello, Grandpa. Happy birthday. lt surprises me that Tancredi gave it to Emma as a wedding gift. Tell me, how did you manage to lose today's race? lt was fixed. They wanted him out of the running. l don't think so... - l was up against someone stronger. - lmpossible! - The Recchis are unbeatable. - That's right. The doctor said we shouldn't worry. He is fighting with all his strength and his heart is responding well. He has decided. l'm glad you lost the race. From now on you won't have any further distractions. l want to go to London to see Herzog and De Meuron. - Who? - They designed the new Tate Gallery. The Tate Gallery? l want to give them the scaffolding covers for the next project. - lt'd guarantee years of work. - Are you sure? - Madam, you look beautiful. - Thank you. - How are we doing here? - Well. ls everything all right? Betta, Eva works in Atellani's, the bookshop on Corso Magenta. The one below Grandpa's house? l've never seen you there. l've not been there long. l'm in the art department. - Where is Pierluigi? - He's coming. Thank you. Not Edo's ukha dish again! Enough! No, it's fabulous! "Ton sur ton." You're right, Andrea. "Ton sur ton" is better than "con sur con"! Eva, how did the race go? You were there, right? The guy who beat Edo is a chef. - Do you know him? - No. But his restaurant is in a building owned by my family. - Beaten by a chef? - lt wasn't fair. - Edo won. - lf you say so... Shall we go? - Can l see it? - Together with the others. Thanks. Let's go. May l have your attention? l have all of my granddaughter's drawings on a wall. When she becomes a famous painter, l'll have people pay to see them. What is this? l took it at the Hanbury Gardens. You took me there. l want to move into photography now. l like it. lt's beautiful. Yes, l like it too. l'm just thrown by novelties. l don't think he likes it. You still owe me a drawing. Come here. l like it. lt's wonderful. Really. Thank you. For you. Thank you. My dear friends, l don't want to die and l won't as long as the business carries on in the same spirit in which l created it. Our family's fortune is built on the factory. Every brick, every man, every piece of material is living proof of what we have been. We engraved our name in our country's history when, both during the war and after, we were able to tend to its needs with our factory's constant, busy activity. The company was born Recchi, and Recchi it must remain forever. The time has come for me to retire and name my successor. My son has always lived up to my expectations. l knew he would from the moment l first held him in my arms. Thank you, Tancredi, for having been the son l always wanted and for having created such a marvelous family. l see qualities in your children... that will lead them to live intense and fruitful lives, as l have. Of course, my grandson had to choose this day of all days to interrupt our family's athletic tradition! Therefore... l have decided to leave everything in your hands, Tancredi. And in your son Edoardo's. lt will take two men to replace me! Here's to Tancredi and Edoardo! To the Recchis! Come here, you winner! Go to the cellar. Bring two bottles of '49. Yes? lt's for Edoardo Recchi. - Can l take it? - l'd prefer to deliver it myself. - Who are you? - Antonio Biscaglia. One moment. This way. Follow the path. lt'll take you to the entrance of the villa. lda, leave it. What are you doing here? That's the chef-- the one who beat Edo. Come in! l wanted to bring you a gift. A gift? For me? l get it. You're no longer certain of your victory today. - You put up a good fight. - Come in. lt's a special night for my family. l'd rather not, thanks. As you wish. l made you a cake. l'm a chef. Mama! l want to show you something. - This is Antonio. - Good evening. Look what he made for me. lsn't it a work of art? He made it. He's the guy that beat me today. That's why he doesn't want to stay. - Please stay. - lt doesn't matter, thanks. - Are you going to bed, Mama? - Yes, my love. lda! l have to take this bottle to Grandpa - don't let him leave! - Should the cake go in the fridge? - No. Please, come in. SOME MONTHS LATER Good morning, Madam. - How is your son, Edo? - Fine, thank you. - Just the blazer? - Yes, only the blazer. l've managed to get rid of those nasty stains. - lt's fine. - Yes. This is for you. Wait, Mrs. Recchi, l found this. l saved it from the washing machine. l made it just in time. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Being part of a couple is as nice as being alone. We need to be brave. They are the words of a song that a friend made me listen to. She's the one in the photo. Her name is Angaharad. Edo, you're the only one who loves me how I am. I have been with a girl. Gregorio keeps on phoning. He pretends not to understand. Maybe he doesn't understand. I don't know if I'll see her again, it was very beautifuI. But I'm in love with another girl. I love Angaharad. I don't know what she thinks of me, or if she Iikes girIs. Does it matter? Today I managed to make her laugh. Antonio! Antonio? - Hi, Tom! - You finally made it! You told me there were spectacular views, but l can't see anything! You're right, it's lovely here. - lsn't it a bit too remote? - Two hours by car. You're right. l'm having a party at my house, for Eva's birthday. l want to ask her to marry me. Don't you have anything to say? - Congratulations. - A little enthusiasm would be good! Honestly, l'm happy. Let's drink to it. Best wishes! Try this. lt's eggplant and elderflower, l extracted the essence from here. lf l did this at the restaurant, my father'd be mad. He doesn't understand what l do. He just thinks of the money. lmagine a restaurant here. People would have to climb up to try my dishes. The essence of flavors. As simple as this place. Do it. - This is all his, he'd never let me. - Have you asked him? He thinks it's madness, biting off more than l can chew. He says nobody would come. - l'll convince him. - lt's not that easy. Come on, give me a hand. You've become a real wimp. Did you invite me here to work? - Oh, how are you today? - Doing well, thank you! - Good morning! How are you? - Fine, Rachele. - l'm so glad you've stayed with us. - Me too, Madam. She is in a terrible mood, despite having won the lottery. Four straight numbers... l should've listened to her! - You too? - l keep her company. As if coming to my husband's funeral wasn't enough for her. She wrote that she shares my sorrow over Edoardo's death. Shares what? My husband was mine alone, and anything that happened without me is of no importance! - Emma! - Andrea! She's in a terrible rage! l have to go. - Conference call with your husband. - Goodbye. Thanks, Emma. Tancredi called me from London yesterday. He is making important decisions. lt was like listening to his father. He gets more like him every day. Elisabetta? She never calls. What is she up to? She likes the school she has chosen. She's very busy studying. - She wanted to come back today... - Do you like her? Sorry? Edo's girlfriend, the Ugolini girl. Eva? She's very nice. He seems happy with her. l wouldn't be surprised if they made an important announcement soon. The perfect wedding for her and her family. Marriage: Number 36 on the Lotto. That should be lucky! Let's carry on the family tradition. Give it to her from me. Thank you. lda, it's bustling! We're almost done, Madam. The chef's been cooking for two hours. Mama! Why are you here? Remember Antonio? You met on Grandpa's birthday. Yes. - Good evening. - Good evening, Madam. Excuse me. Since l tried his cooking, l fell in love with him. Did you prepare all this on your own? No, Franco helped me. Russian salad... - Why don't you try? - l don't know how... - She's a great cook. Go on, Mama! - Give it a go. lt's not difficult. - lt looks dangerous. - lt isn't. Be brave. l'll help you. - Hi, Franco. - Good evening. - Perfect, isn't it? - Perfect! Mama... Were you sleeping? Good idea. You won't get any peace tonight. Do you miss Russia? Sometimes. You know... great things are happening there. Sweetheart... Bye. - How is the party going? - Very well, Madam. Are you tired, lda? No, we've had tougher ones. Anyway, Edo is so happy. Please sit with me. Tell me what's going on. Edo has spent all evening with Eva. He left her only to try and take his chef friend away from the kitchen. He thinks very highly of him. Luckily, Mr. Tancredi is in London. He doesn't really like evenings like these. - Shall l close the curtains? - Yes, thanks. Did you see the wonderful dish your son's friend sent you? The party cost more than we'd agreed. lt was a lovely evening. Edo was so happy. A shame you weren't there. Do you think he wants to marry her? Your mother is convinced. Elisabetta thinks so too. How is Betta? l thought she looked well; maybe a bit sad. l think she wants to get back with Gregorio. She told me you're picking her up tomorrow. Yes, after lunch with Rori. l have to admit l was wrong. Going to London was the right thing for her. She likes it there. She seems more motivated. l don't think she will go back to Gregorio. She doesn't love him. lda? Here. What does that mean? What does Edo think of selling? He is slowly coming to terms with it. He can't remain anchored to the past. Gianluca thinks that selling is the only sensible option. And what do you think about his restaurant idea? lt's his money! You know what l think about my father's decision? Edo isn't at all ready to make decisions about the company. He still needs a lot of guidance. Edoardo's mother has confirmed three people for one o'clock. Yes, l know. - What's she like? - Who? Mrs. Recchi. ls she a nice person? She's nice. Can l have the press? Thanks. What are you charging Edo for the party? lt was my gift to him. Leghorn-style cod. This goes onto the menu. We did it! 1995 Bergheim Riesling Altenberg. Excellent. The first time my son mentioned Emma was when we were at La Scala, on St. Ambrose's feast day. You were still in Russia. Tancredi said, "Mama, l'm marrying a woman more beautiful than you." Naturally, l didn't believe him. To the Recchi wives! Coming here today was a great idea. Edo is right to believe in his friend. He's a real talent. l'm worried they're pushing it a bit. The idea of the restaurant was rather rushed. Too much enthusiasm can cause one not to think straight. Edoardo is an intelligent man. He knows what he's doing. Marinated egg yolk, pea cream and zucchini flowers; prawns with ratatouille and sweet-and-sour sauce; and mixed fish with crunchy vegetables. Enjoy your meal. Where would you like to live? l wouldn't mind London. l know a law firm where l could be an apprentice. l love the city... Welcome, ladies. Antonio, this is Edo's grandmother. You already know Emma. - How do you do? - An excellent meal. l heard of your project with my grandson. l'd be happy to give my opinion regarding the furnishing. Thank you. And thanks for coming. They seemed happy. l think so. l made prawns for your mother. l know my father only listens to you, but l'll try and tell him. Rori, excuse me a moment. Am l interrupting? - l'd like to thank you. You are great. - Thanks. The risotto, the prawns, the vegetables... they were exquisite. - l grow the vegetables myself. - Really? Where? Near Sanremo, in the countryside, where your son and l plan to set up our restaurant. How will you manage not being here? Hey, Franco, let me do that. Good evening, Madam. l'll go on Thursdays when we are closed here, and between shifts whenever l can. - See you soon. - With pleasure. Here l am! Mama! Grandma! How wonderful to see you. - How was the trip? - Fine. - How are you? - Very well. Betta! Why did you come? What do you mean, why? What have you done? - Goodbye. - What? Shall we go? l'm sorry l missed Eva's party. Edo's crazy about Antonio, right? They want to open a restaurant. He wants me to stop off on my way to Nice. - For your exhibition? - Yes. - Can l tell you something? - Of course. l left Gregorio for her. lt's not a passing thing, l'm sure. Do you like her? She's beautiful. Very beautiful. l don't want to tell dad, or Gianluca. They wouldn't understand. Here, she looks amazing. Why don't you come to Nice with me? - l might. - We can be together. Can I offer you something to drink? Why don't you come with me? We can look for a space for my exhibition. We'll leave on Tuesday, Sanremo to Nice. What will you do when we're all in London? I grow the vegetables myself, near Sanremo. Her name's Angaharad, she's my teacher. Edo can't stay anchored to the past, things change. Edo, darling... l'm out of town. l've decided to go to see Betta in Nice. But don't tell her. l'll call you later. - l'll be right with you, Madam. - Thank you. Mrs. Recchi! How come you're here? l'm going to visit Betta. Oh, the exhibition in Nice. Edo told me about it. - How about you? - The restaurant is closed today. Right, it's Thursday... the countryside... the vegetables. lf you aren't too busy, why don't you come with me? lt's just a slight detour. l'll show you where Edo and l will open the restaurant. He's already been there a few times. Okay. My truck's there. - Were you born here? - No, my father's from here. The land is my grandfather's. l started cooking here as a child. l love cooking, but l'm not as good as you. Edo tells me the opposite. He always talks about you. And he talks to me about you. He'll be happy you came. Take a little walk around. l'll be back in a bit. Something smells good, lda. l made spelt soup. Why don't you dine with me this evening? lt's strange being in an empty house. Thank you, Madam, but you know l have my ways. - They could change. - No... - Your son called. - What did he say? He asked if you'll pass by the factory to say goodbye, before he leaves. Bye, see you in half an hour. How are you, Eva? We fired too many workers. We had responsibilities towards them. Think of their families. Grandpa wouldn't have done this. Yes, he would. He always did what was best for the company. That's not true. Respect for the name, traditions and values is what matters. There. Don't be a hypocrite. You know it's not like that. Grandpa had no qualms about dealing with the regime, acting as if nothing was going on while he exploited Jewish workers. That's what we are. That's what we Recchis are. We'll talk about this again in London. Too many things are heading in the wrong direction. l'm always so happy to come here. l came here with Grandpa as a kid. He brought me here into the canteen and sat amongst the workers. He enjoyed making them believe he was one of them. Time moves on. Things change. Mama, at last! We've finished. Everything is being sent to London today. Are you coming to say goodbye? Pity... Never mind, it's nothing. How are you, though? Antonio! l wanted you to have it before l leave. Your father has signed. He's granted us half of the land and permission to open the restaurant. You don't seem very happy. Tell you what, l'll look at the papers and we'll talk when you get back. lf you aren't sure, just tell me. Sorry. You know how l am, certain things embarrass me. We're hosting a big dinner. My father wants you to handle it. lt's an important business dinner. My mother will call you with the details. Once you've read it, call me. Do you like this CD? How are you? Good morning. A Chinotto please. Thanks. So, for the dinner... What do you suggest? Ligurian dishes? You left this in the truck. Once, Edo told me about a dish you make for him. He said it's difficult to make. Ukha. You need someone to catch a great deal of fish from a river... lots of different kinds. The most important thing is... that the broth must be clear. You must be able to see through it. When l moved to Milan, l stopped being Russian. There was too much of everything, in the streets, in the shops... l learned to be ltalian. Tancredi collected art. He came to Russia in search of treasure. My father was a restorer. Tancredi used to come to our house. One day he asked me out. He was shy and sweet. We couldn't be seen in public, so we rode in a cab until dawn and then made love. He brought me to Milan and l haven't been back to Russia since. lf l got homesick, l cooked. One day l made a soup that my grandmother taught me. Ukha. Edo, who was six then, liked it so much he kept asking me to make more. Edo loves my being Russian. Emma... Emma is not my real name. Tancredi gave it to me. What is your real name? l no longer know it. At home... they all called me Kitesh. Say it. Sell. Your grandfather was a great man, but we have to look to the future. Papa! What, Edo? Gianluca took me to the Atlantique. l thought l'd get him back by taking him to an Electrelane concert. But he loved it! Being among a crowd of ecstatic lesbians! Betta, it's done. We're selling. We'll be even richer. Come here. Thanks, if it weren't for you... You mustn't thank me. l did it out of selfishness. l'm happy knowing you're happy. Happy? "Happy" is a word that makes one sad. Why aren't you happy? Edo, what's wrong? - Can you give this to Mama? - Yes, sure. You look nice with short hair. Did you speak to Edoardo? When we got back, l found him relieved. lt's important for us all to stick together. - Sorry, were you watching it? - No, don't worry. l'm tired. - Liliana! - Yes? They're here. Go and help them. Good morning, Madam. Can l help you? Thank you. You disappeared without telling me. Good evening. Mama, let me introduce you to Shai Kubelkian. Good evening, l'm Rori. - Beatrice Tavecchia. - Good evening. - Sorry? - Tancredi told him you're Russian. Thanks. Can l talk to you? - l want to see you happy. - l am happy. Thanks to you, to Antonio, to my mother, and to him, or her. Excuse me. Mama! Does Edo know you prepared his soup? No, he doesn't. He'll be pleased. - You have wonderful children. - Thanks. Darling... Thank you, Mama. l'll go, you stay here. Please forgive us. You've now seen an example of Russian temper. Edo and his mother... Wait! Wait for me! Listen to me! Let's talk. l beg you, look at me and listen! - You're lying. - What? - You're just like the others. - What do you mean? You're just like Gianluca, Papa, Antonio. You even gave him our ukha. l wanted to tell you something important, but no... l don't want anything to do with you, you're nothing to me. Trust me, Edo! Don't touch me! Good evening. l don't have good news... Your son suffered a head injury which caused a hematoma that pressed against his brain. So we removed it. But the fall also caused a more serious hemorrhage. He never regained consciousness. l don't think he suffered. l'm sorry. l'll take you to him. Kitesh... Emma! Madam. You have to wake up. Our Lord Jesus Christ, who after resting three days in the sepulcher gave assurance of resurrection to those who believe in You, let our brother Edoardo rest in peace until the day You, the Resurrection and the Life, will illuminate him with the splendor of Your vision so that he may see the glory of Your Kingdom, You who live and reign eternally. Amen. Give him everlasting rest and eternal peace in the glory of Your light. Amen. Emma... You no longer know who l am. Darling, please. We mustn't go out of our minds. We have to carry on. Together. l love Antonio. You don't exist. Madam! Gianluca? Rori? Betta? Mama?
