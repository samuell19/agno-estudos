New York? Well, I'm not picky, Ash. Anywhere is better than here. Rotting corpse of Detroit. I'm serious. As soon as school's out... Hmm, it's only been two days, but I... I miss you, too. I... I really, really like you, Ash, you know that. I just... Don't pout. Just tell me what time you're picking me up. Okay. Keep us from harm and in one another's company, so that we may be there for one another when there is a need for comfort. We thank You, Lord, for our health, for our faith. And we pray for Your mercy and grace. Amen. Amen. Amen. Cool. Should we eat then? Is that an owl? What? Oh, yeah. Can I see it? Caleb. Awesome. You know, that's permanent, right? What? I mean, the guy in the alley told me that it'll wash off in two weeks. Well, shit. I mean, how am I gonna go to cotillion like this? Language! You know what else is permanent? - Family. - Family? Family. Morgan, you're our daughter, and you always will be. Nothing can change that. Your mother is entitled to show concerns about the decisions you're making about your future. What affects you affects all of us. Okay, James, can we just... Can we just have breakfast? - Oh, yeah. Okay, all right. - Okay? Um... Morgan, can you just pass the eggs, please? Oh, yes. Yes, ma'am. Thank you so much. I'll get it. You sit. Who was it, Dad? Oh, it's just some dumb kids playing a prank on us. "The air is cool, the season is fall, soon, Halloween will come to all." Is that a Boo? It's nothing, Caleb. Uh, nothing looks a hell lot like a bag of candy. Let's just eat, okay? "The air is cool, the season is fall, soon, Halloween will come to all. Terror and horror, spooks galore." Caleb. "Tricky witches are at your door." "The spooks are looking for things to do. In fact, one brought this Boo to you. The excitement comes and goes like you, copy this note and make it two. We'll all have smiles upon our faces, no one will know who Booed whose places. But Hallows' Eve will sure be grand. Laugh along and follow the plan. If you fail to pass this Boo, the spooks will bring your past to you." Are you finished? Yes, sir. Did you hear me tell you to stop? Jesus! He's just messing around. - Gotta have some fun. - Uh, no. It's paganism is what it is. We don't do Halloween in this house. But... we have to. Excuse me? It's not a joke. It's not a prank. If you don't pass it along, uh... It's... it's a curse. Okay, James, could you just please just get that damn thing out of here? - No. No, don't. - It's okay. Sweetie, it's okay. It's okay. Dude, it's just a stupid chain letter. That's something for the neighborhood moms to do. There's this kid at school, Gabe Dawson. His cousin got a Boo. When she didn't pass it along, she died in a bathtub. Hey! Morgan, that's not funny. And there was this, this, this Vietnam vet, old guy in the 80s. All the kids hated him, so one year, they Booed him as a joke. Ghost stories, Caleb. - But... - No. No buts. Give it to me. That's it. And you're lighter. I don't have a lighter. Yes, you do. There's nothing that goes on in this house that I don't know about. Give it to me. - Let's go. - Lighter? Yes, lighter! Oh, no! The only ghost is a Holy Ghost. The only curse you need to worry about is when you take His name in vain. Are we clear on that? I said, "Are we clear on that?" Crystal? Crystal. Have a nice breakfast. Oh, James. Oh, god! Fucking nuts. A house fire on Detroit's West Side from last night's Devil's Night activities is strongly suspected of having been yet another case of arson. Now, according to police, witnesses have told them that a group of teenagers have been loitering, all afternoon and into the evening, near the vacant houses on Piedmont Street, in the city's worn-down neighborhood between Tireman Avenue and Joy Road. At approximately 11:15 p.m., neighbors reported seeing smoke billowing out of the attic with flames erupting thereafter. Now, some residents said they called the police and fire officials promptly, but that neither the fire department nor the police showed up until, well, after the fire was out of control. So the rushing fires of Devil's Night again continuing this sad and dangerous tradition... Okay. Yes. Okay. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. It's just me and you, Reggie. Reggie? What's wrong? I'm scared, too. Are you? What? Do you believe in... ...ghosts? Boo! What are you doing? I think there is something in our home. It felt like... I don't know, like I was being watched. Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. You do? Yeah. I don't appreciate it. You go. I'm trying to get ready. Okay. Okay. Where do you think you're going? Oh, shit! Uh, I'm just gonna head out and see Ash for a little bit. Nope. You're watching Caleb tonight. But why? You're not the only one who has plans tonight, honey. You can go down to the bar where everyone knows your name and drown your sorrows any night of the week. Uh, I mean, looks like you got enough here to do the job. It's Halloween. And whether we celebrate it or not, it's a night where you just still like go out and have fun. What about my fun? You already had yours, remember? And maybe a little bit too much. You're looking at it. You have no idea what you're talking about. I can do the math. Upstairs, now! You're not going anywhere tonight. Or tomorrow. Or the day after that, or the day after that! Run! Trick or treat! Bitch. You didn't hear that. I'm gonna head out, okay? See Ash for a little bit. What about the curse? What if it happens and I'm here alone? There is no curse. Just some lame-ass superstition. You know, like, uh... Dad's religious bullshit. Morgan. All right, that's... that's him. I gotta go, okay? Don't leave. You're the only one left. What are you talking about? Mom and Dad, they, they don't care anymore... about each other, about us. That's not true. You don't care either. Why are you doing this to me right now? Look... I do care, okay? But I care about Ash as well. Let me go see him for a few hours, and then you can, uh, I don't know watch a movie, eat some candy. And, I don't know, if the doorbell rings, maybe just don't answer it. Okay? Sure. Be brave, creep. It's like Freddy Krueger, right? Curses can't hurt you if you aren't afraid of 'em. No. Morgan, you can't go! Ash? Ash? You know, this hide-and-seek should... Oh, shit! - Are you serious? - What? Come on, it was a joke. It's Halloween. Hey. Really? - I... - I thought I'd be funny. It's not... It's not funny. It's funny when I do it to Caleb. It's not funny when you do it to me. Okay. Sorry, I just didn't think you'd be such a pussy about it. Oh, okay. You're an asshole. - Thanks. - Mm-mm. Sorry. It was a joke. I'm sorry. Jokes are funny. That was something... - Oh! - Okay. Come on, I was joking. Okay. Hey. Baby. Come on. You still pissed at me? Morgan. No, Ash. I'm not pissed at you. You know me. I'm... pissed at everyone. Okay, well... Well, let's just go and have some fun, okay? Trick or treat! Asshole! So you wanna talk to me now? Listen, I know something's up... 'cause your ring is dark as hell. Yeah. I'm no color expert, but I can only imagine pitch black doesn't mean you're happy. Or... horny. Or whatever it is. I got the cure. Yeah, but it just cures the sickness, not the disease. What? So you got a disease now? My family is. Uh, what are you talking about? I don't know, just... something Caleb said earlier, I guess. Caleb? Mouthy little fucker. Yeah. He's a little fucker. But he... he notices things, you know? What about your mom? You know, we never talk about her. Oh, 'cause she doesn't exist. Not anymore. That must be nice. What? No. No, trust me. Not having a mom sucks. I meant the non-existing. Don't. Okay. I mean it. Jesus, I was fucking joking. - I'm not! - Phew. I love you. Oh, why does it bother you so much when I say it? Means I'm not ready to say it. Then don't. I'm not forcing you to. We're just talking about me. Yeah, but it's not just something you say. I know. It's something that you feel... for a while. And then you don't. And then... you're stuck. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, you're not thinking like one day... I guess, I just shouldn't... I guess I just wouldn't mind being stuck with you. Stupid, I know. Like would being stuck with me be so bad. I just... I don't know. I... I gotta get out here. I can't take another four years of this house, I swear to God, of Mom's drinking and... Dad's fire and brimstone shit. You'll get out. What if I just wasn't good enough, like I don't get in anywhere... You worry too much, baby. Hey, did I ever... Did I ever mention that to you? Maybe. You're so beautiful, and you're smart. I'd be fucking lucky to have you. Okay, what if, just for a night, let me tell you I love you. I mean, not worrying about tomorrow. Or yesterday. Mom. Mom, it's Caleb. Can you just... Will you just come home when you get this? Morgan's not here, and, and I'm here alone. And, uh, I'm... I'm really scared, Mom. I think there, uh... I think there's something here with me. Mom, please. Please, just come home when you get this. Please! Morgan. Where the hell are you? Caleb's alone, and you, missy... the second you get home, you are in so much trouble. Whatever you did, wherever you were, I hope it was worth it. James. You okay? Your daughter snuck out again. I need you. I need you... Where you at? Elyse? Elyse, are you there? Are you there? Elyse, are you there? - Elyse? - Shit! Okay, question. So the "A" on your hand, can I ask you about it? You did already. No, you told me to ask you again later. What? Goddamn! Like a fucking, you know, Magic 8-Ball. It's this thing that I use to... kinda remind myself that... I'm actually here, and that it's not a dream. That this is real. You and I are real. Oh, so it's not... Mm-mm. - No. - No? No. So I was thinking I was gonna get an "M" right here. Like, uh, be like Joe Pesci in Home Alone. Yeah, yeah, I mean... - Yeah? - Sure, whatever. Hey. You'll be okay. What the fuck! What the fuck are you doing? - I need to go home, right now. - It's all right. It's... What? It's fine. - I want to go home now! - Are you... Okay, okay, okay. Look, it's okay, it's real. Look at your hand. - I wanna go right now! - Okay, let's go. Fuck. Morgan. "And if any mischief follow, thy shalt give a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." Oh. "A hand for a hand, a foot for a foot, burning for burning, wound for wound." What the... Shit! Ah, fuck! Shit. Reggie? Reggie! Reggie? Reggie, Reggie. What's wrong, baby? He died. Who? Reggie. It is happening. Nothing's happening. - No, no. - I'm here. Okay, it's... It's the curse. It killed my fish. Honey. Goldfish die all the time. You know what? We'll get another one. I promise. I promise. Hey, you know what? You know what, baby? Let's just... Let's get to sleep. Let's just go. Let's just get to sleep. Okay? Yeah, there we go. There we go. Here we go. Yeah. There you go, babe. Yeah. Okay. Snug like a bug in a rug. What? It's just that it's, um... It's been a long time since you hugged me like that. When you were little, you used to get scared and you would make me stay with you until you fell asleep. Mm-hm. And I would... I would play in your hair. Oh. My beautiful baby. Now, close your eyes. Close 'em. Let's just go to sleep. It's been a long day for everybody, right? The ghost... The ghosts are gonna get me. There's no such thing as ghosts. Ghosts aren't real, baby. You have nothing to be afraid of, right? I guess. Sweet dreams, my love. I'm so... I'm so fucked up. Uh-huh. Where were you? You have to. It's the only way to make it stop. You'll be okay. You have to kill Elyse. Okay, I know that you are going through some things. But you can't just abandon him like that, Morgan. He's 12 years old. When I was 12, I took care of myself all the time. Hey, sweetie. I hate Halloween. It was a weird day. You scared Caleb earlier with that poem stuff. I didn't write the damn thing. I know, but he's a kid, though. He needs to grow up. I don't know if I'm ready for him to. Look at Morgan. She's growing up, and I'm terrified. What happened to my little girl who used to... pick wildflowers with me? Or... Oh, my god. Or used to want her toes painted just like mine? You should talk to him. I think he's still up. I'm beat. I had a rough day, too. Son, you awake? Hey, what are you doing with the light on? Reading. Mom says you're a little scared. Huh? It's okay. It's okay to be a little scared. What you don't wanna be is too scared, all right? So scared that you can't see straight. You gotta remember God's got your back, always. That's why you are never scared? Oh, I am, on occasion. But when I was your age, I was scared all the time. Of what? Um, this guy I knew. He used to chase me around. It was terrible. Take my lunch money. It was the worst. But as a kid, it was like that was the worst thing in the world. One day, I was out by the lake, I was out by myself. Setting off a box of cherry bombs that I had. He started chasing me, going after those cherry bombs. Sent me like right up a tree. Literally up an old oak tree. I just sat up there watching him hover below just like a shark. He was calling me names, and saying he was gonna do this and that to me when I came down. So, what did you do? I got scared. Like really scared. I mean, so scared I couldn't see right from wrong. I just... I mean... I started lighting the cherry bombs off and dropping them right on his head. So, what happened? Something I regret very much. So I'm trying to tell you, son, fear, it's a dangerous thing. But aren't some things worth being scared of? Some things, of course. Like the curse. Who told you about the curse? Kids at school. They... they say there was this guy, in the 80s. He got... He got a Boo. Yeah, Vietnam vet, right? Someone Booed him. He didn't pass it along. He said it was a prank, like you did. That's not a true story, Caleb. It is true. Really? What was his name then? I don't know. I don't remember. It was some city name. Uh, Memphis? Uh, I, I don't know. Yeah, Memphis. Uh-huh. Anyone know this Memphis? Or just friends of friends of friends of friends? Son, that's something they call "an urban legend." You believe in talking snakes, God, angels. But you don't believe me. I have seen things, Dad. All right, you know what? We'll talk about this blasphemy in the morning. Good boy, Torque. Hey. Pick up the razor. Okay. Okay. Okay. - Just do it, you fucking coward. - Just do it, you fucking coward. You stupid fucking bitch. Just fucking do it. Oh, just fucking... Just fucking do it. Do it! Fuck, fuck! Oh! Oh, James. Oh, shoot! Honey, you scared me. You couldn't sleep either? I'm having bad dreams. Really? Me, too. Where is Papa? I don't know. Downstairs, I think. So, um... Am I gonna get an apology, or we're just gonna pretend like it never happened? For what? Okay, we're just gonna pretend like it never happened. Girl, you're gonna be the death of me, literally. What was that? What was that? Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespassed against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever and ever. Amen. It... It's here. - What? - I told you. All we gotta do is pass it along. It'll be fine, but you didn't believe me. None of you did. I'm getting a little tired of having this conversation with you. I'm not asking you, I'm telling you, go upstairs and go to bed before you wake everybody up. Too late, we're up. I'm calling a fucking family meeting. You can't call a family meeting. - You don't have the authority... - Jesus Christ, James! It's not parliament. We need to talk. We're not talking about this. There is no curse. Well, there's something. We've all felt something. Dad, we've been seeing things. Nightmares. You left your brother alone, and he got scared. You felt guilty and had a bad dream. It happens! We are haunted by our mistakes, not by ghosts. Sometimes, they are the same. James? What did you see? Who says I saw anything? Okay, we may not speak much anymore, but I've lived with you for 20 years. I know when something is upsetting you. Really, Elyse? What was your first clue? Yes, I am upset! Because none of you are... are willing to put your trust and your faith into the Heavenly Father or the earthly one. That is me! Here we go. The Good Book. We're a God-fearing family. I lost a child in this house, James. A child! I know. A child that we didn't expect, want. And until that moment, I didn't understand. You were down here with the Good Book, I was upstairs in the bath, my, my stomach tied in knots! That horrible minute. That horrible minute, it's all I wanted in my life. And I wanted to come to you. I wanted you to be there for me. But you know why I didn't? 'Cause I knew what you would say. This is God's plan. Fuck God if that's His plan! I'm not gonna listen to this. No. Of course, you're not. You don't hear anything that you don't wanna hear. Hey, where do you think you're going? I'm calling Ash and I'm leaving. The hell you are. You get right back here and stay here. Why? So you can give us another sermon? She's right. You know, that's all you ever do. You're gonna sit me down again, have a conversation about the coward's way out? The only coward that I see here is you. Too afraid to admit that there just might be something wrong. Goddamnit, this is my house! It is not safe anymore. Caleb, go upstairs with your sister. Get your stuff, get my purse, we're leaving. Would you like to come with us? 'Cause we're gonna go. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me. Talk! Talk to me, talk to me. Talk. Talk to me! Talk! Talk! Talk! What was that? I don't know. It's locked. It's locked! It won't turn. The door's locked. What do you mean it's locked? It's stuck. The handle won't even turn. Well, it can't just... That doesn't make any sense. Caleb's right. It's been after us all day. And now we're here all together. All right, listen. You just need to relax. Calm down. Everything's gonna be fine. I promise. James! What the fuck! Caleb, we gotta go! Torque! Torque! James. James, wake up. James. James. Are you okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. - What the hell? - You go get the kids! Go get the kids! Okay. Okay. Okay. Caleb? Caleb. Caleb, where are you? Hello? Caleb? Torque? Hey, buddy. Hey, Torque. Hey. Hey, buddy. Okay. I don't know what to do. Please. Mom! Mom? Mom? Mom? What the fuck? Oh! Stop it. Stop! Damn it! God! Torque? Oh, family. Family, oh, family. Oh, family. Family, oh, family. Honey, what are you doing? Morgan. Nothing can hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's so cold. Okay, Morgan. I need you to get up and come with me. You can't protect me. No one can hurt me again if I do it to myself. I love you so much and I'm so sorry I wasn't here for you when you needed me, but I'm here now. I'm here now, for as long as we have. And I understand. No, you don't. Baby, just please, just... Just... Can you just talk to me, please? Please, just... Okay. Baby, just, just... Just put down the knife. I promise. I promise I'll listen. What? You? Oh, no. No. No. An eye for an eye! An eye for an eye! An eye for an eye! An eye for an eye! An eye for an eye! An eye for an eye! An eye for an eye! An eye for an eye! An eye for an eye! An eye for an eye! Torque! Torque! James? James, are you down here? - Dad? - I have Morgan. - Do you have Caleb? James? - Caleb! James? - Dad? - James. Bring your past to you. The spooks, the spooks, the spooks. The spooks will bring your past to you. The spooks will bring your past to you. The spooks will bring your past to you. The spooks will bring your... James, it's Elyse. Morgan is here, she's with me. Hey, Dad. Hey. Hey. James, what's wrong? Look up. - Look at me. - Dad? Whatever this thing is, I think we can beat it. Together, we can beat it. Dad, it's not real, okay? We are real. Damn it, James, we need you. Dad, wake up. - Wake up! - We are a family. We can get through this as a family. Listen to me, okay? I... I need you to know that... I love you so much, okay? Hey. Hey. It will be okay. I can see. My eyes. - They were... They were gone. - No, it's okay. - They're back now, okay? - I know. Caleb was right. And so were you. It's just a dream. Caleb. On the boulevard. Where is he? Caleb? We were looking for you. You were right, son. We should have listened. We'll write down the poem, and we'll pass it along. Just like what you said in the first place, okay? Caleb? Caleb, what the hell are you doing? - Oh! - Caleb! - Caleb! - Oh! Open up, Caleb! Caleb, open the fucking door! - Caleb! - Caleb! - Please, Caleb! - Open the door! Please! Open the door! Caleb! Caleb! Open the fucking... Open the door! Open the door! - Caleb! - Please! Caleb! Open the door! Caleb! - Caleb! - Caleb! - Oh! - Caleb! Caleb, please! Caleb, please! Subtitles by explosiveskull
