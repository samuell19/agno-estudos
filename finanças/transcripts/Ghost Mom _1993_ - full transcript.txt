Get out! We got a one-two-four. Get an ambulance down here. ...suspect is a car, silver four-door, 797, Sam, Roger, 0. Get an ambulance here right away. - What do you got? - Gunshot victim. Three-- No, four gunshot wounds, head, abdomen, right leg. -Pulse is weak and frailty. -Pulse is absent. We're going to trauma, folks. Prepare an amp of adrenaline. Fire up the defibrillator for 200 watts. He's bleeding bad internally. Cross him tight for six units. Somebody call the trauma team. I'll notify the OR and hold the, uh, CT technician. Everybody move. Move. Set up two large bottles of IV. There it is right there. Okay. Let's clean and close. Andy, wow, I got a real mess here. Dr. Anderson, Dr. Cavanaugh, what do we have? Gunshot wounds. Vitals very unstable. Nine millimeters semi wadcutters. Go in small, come out the size of a dog's head. What kind of dog? - A Shih Tzu? - Bless you. Well, this might not be as bad as it looks. Uh, suction, please. Tail is shattered, head of the tib, fib. No more pro ball for this kid. Sponge. Okay. Let's plant that artery right there. Good. Well, considering he's down about three quartz, I'd say our friend is holding on pretty good. How about that, in through the zygoma and out through the mastoid. Missed his brain entirely. Mr. Lucky. Television series, 1958. John Vivyan played the title role. Ross Martin played his partner. Forceps. And Ross Martin's next series was? Hold that right there for me will you please, nurse? Wild, Wild West, Robert Conrad. Clamp. Gauze. Oh. Looks like you're gonna make it, Mr. Serpico. 1973, Al Pacino, Paramount. Who produced it? Dino De Laurentiis. Written by? Uh, Norman Wexler and Waldo Salt. Based on a book by? Peter Maas. More gauze. He definitely gets a Siskel and Ebert award. Thank you. Breathing's stopped. I think he's occluded. - What's going on? - He's choking. All right. Scalpel. Let's go for a tracheotomy. Wait. There's something in his throat. Forceps. Forceps. Should I keep working here? Some... Look at that. What the hell? - Wow. - Ew. Heard of a high-fiber diet, but this guy eats rocks. Breathing's normal. Okay, everybody, let's get back to work. Well, there's not a lot more I can do until you guys finish up. I'll take a couple more x-rays. Maybe a CAT scan. See if he's got any neuro deficits. Nurse, come with me. Zero, zero, one. - Hold that clamp. - Yeah. Now, what the hell do you think you're doing here? Martin, if the only way I can get to see you is to come to your work, then I'll come to your work. Mother, do you have any idea how many millions this hospital pays in malpractice insurance? Do you know what this administration would do to me if they knew that my mother was in the operating room during surgery? You did a wonderful job in there. I was very proud. Mother, what is it? What is it you want? What makes you think I want anything? Maybe I just stopped by to say hello? His mother, she's a real nutcase. Comes here all the time. Right into the operating room? That's a new one. Usually she just wastes his time having herself tested for every known ailment under the sun. He's not gonna have a career if she keeps this up. He should put her in a home. Mother, there's nothing wrong with you. -Nothing? -Nothing. What about bursitis? Okay. Maybe you have a touch of bursitis. That's not nothing. Mom, eventually everyone gets a touch of bursitis. I probably have a touch of bursitis. But that's not what's upsetting me. Well, then, what are we talking about? -It's Jean. -Jean? Mother, you go through housekeepers like paper towels. I think Jean is great. Oh. Okay. Okay. What's wrong with Jean? -She seems perfect to me. -No. I don't trust her. And I don't like her in my house. She's bossy, and I'm just a helpless old woman. Oh, that's ridiculous. Come see for yourself. Come to dinner tonight. I can't. I've got other plans. Besides, we're all going over to Aunt Pearl's for dinner tomorrow. I'll check her out then. Well, never mind. Don't trouble yourself. Come on, Mom. Don't walk off on me. ...Dr. Shenahan to radiology. Dr. Shenahan to radiology. What is it, Mom? What's really bothering you? I miss you, Martin. When I was working to put you through school, my life had purpose. It was us against the world. Somehow that made it all make sense. I guess I just need time to get used to you not being there. Mom, I've been out of the house since I was 18. Well, that just proves my point. What point? That I've lost all sense of time. That my life has become a prison. -Oh, I must be near the end. -Oh, dear. Please come to dinner tonight. -Okay. I'll come to dinner. -Good. Seven o'clock. Don't be late. We looked everywhere. He must have the stone with him. What about the car? He may have hidden it there. -He didn't-- -Don't look at me. He didn't have time to hide it in his car. We were shooting at him. He had the stone when he left here. Retrace every step he made. What if we don't find anything? Then we go to the hospital and get him. Why did you take this job? Are you a do-gooder? I hate do-gooders, you know. -I think they're all phonies. -Me too. It's Martin, isn't it? You're after him, aren't you? Your son? No. I'm not after Martin. - Mom, where are you? - Hmm, in here, honey. Hi. -Oh, hi. -Hi. -So did you get the check okay? -Yup. No problem. Good. How have things been going? -Good. Good. -Good. You've been busy at the hospital. -Yeah. -Great. Yeah. Very good. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just thought we ought to get this dinner going before we all starve. - Here. Let me do that. - Oh, yes. Well, that's what you're paid for. - Mother. - No. She's quite right. Why don't you two go in and sit down, I'll bring the food out. Come on. -See what I mean? -What? -Bossy. -I think she's nice. You don't know her like I do. Would you like me to get to know her a little better? Hope you like scalloped potatoes. I love them. I hope you like 'em crispy. I love them crispy. Stop drooling over each other. It makes me sick. -Oh. I'll, uh, go get the meat. -You're not eating with us? I ate before you got here. I'll let you and your mother have a little visit. Why are you so mean to her? I know just what will happen. You'll fall in love with her. You'll marry her. You'll take her off to live with you. And I'll be left with no help, and no son. No. I'll tell you what's gonna happen. I'm gonna stay single for the rest of my life so that I can keep you company. Oh, don't be so mellow dramatic. I want you to be happy. No, you don't. It used to be every time I dated a woman, you'd go berserk. Now you're flipping out before I even date them. Ah ha! So you are planning to date Jean then? No. I'm not planning on dating Jean. Shh. Well, if you need anything, just holler. Please promise me you won't date her. Do you mind if we don't talk about this anymore? If you wish. How were things at the hospital today? -You were there, remember? -Indeed, I was. And I have my lucky stone as a souvenir. -What? -Don't you remember? You gave it to me, in the operating room. Oh, yeah. Mom, it's a worthless piece of rock. Well, I like it. The government agents we spoke to on the telephone are here now, sir. Oh, come in. Thanks for seeing us on such short notice, sir. We got the first flight in as soon as we find out you were the only one that could help us. Oh, how can I help you? We've had a couple of suspects under surveillance who we believe are connected with the Japanese mafia. I'm an archaeologist. I collect and study ancient artifacts. We had a gangland shooting, and we traced the car to a warehouse where we found this. We think the sword has something to do with the shooting. We were hoping you could help us identify it, sir. Well, I need to do some carbon testing to date it. But you, gentlemen, may have found the legendary Cluster Sword. What's that? The Cluster Sword of the samurai. Around 650 AD, two warlords waged a very long bloody battle for the love of the Princess Ise. The two warlords were killed, and the princess died giving birth to a son, Yamato. Now, according to legend, Yamato was raised by the fathers of the clouds. They gave him the Cluster Sword. Its forged steel gave him limitless power in battle. And the, uh, Ise Stone, which is missing, gave him the power to communicate with the dead. -So it's valuable? -It's priceless. And of unparalleled value to Japanese history. It could verify the legend of the father of the samurai and the Ise Stone. The Ise Stone is, uh... The red diamond missing from the handle. A red diamond this size could be the most valuable diamond in the world. I hope you don't mind me riding in the front. I get carsick in the back. I don't mind at all. It's a treat to be in any seat in this car. Do you drive? Yeah. But my international license just expired. And the left-hand steering still spooks me a bit. Oh, all you need is some practice. I don't mind taking you out a few times if you want. -Yeah? -Yeah. That's very nice of you. Why don't you two just rent a room and get it over with? Don't mind Mom. She hates it when I talk to anyone but her. Just drive. We're late enough as it is. Once more Pearl will blame me for ruining her day. Where are they? Don't worry. We'll keep an eye out for them. Nice shot. Okay. Okay, I'll wear my glasses. I hope nothing's happened to them. Martin's a doctor. Nothing ever happens to doctors. Well, would you let me know when they get here? I got to put the bread in at the last minute. Hey, could you ask George to move that ice cream truck around to the back? I don't want the kids bugging us again. -Okeydokey. -Oh, for Pete's sake. Ow. -Where'd it go? -I don't know. Oh, there they are. -Hi, Milly. -Hi, Milly. -Hi, Uncle Al. -Hi, Marty. How you doing? -Great. Hi. -Good to see you. -You guys break any windows yet? -Oh. -Uh, this is Jean Connolly. -Hi. It's about time Marty got himself a woman. We were starting to wonder about him. No. No. Jean's Mom's new housekeeper. - Oh. Welcome. - Hi. Nice to meet you. -It's a beautiful home you have. -Oh, Mom. -You're very welcome in here. -Hi. Mom. Sorry, Mom. Here. What happened? - Does it hurt? - Ow. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, don't move. Don't-- Don't-- Just stay right-- Don't move. Let her go. Mildred. -Hello, Wesley. How are you? -Never better. Agnes, you look nice. Laura, pretty dress. -Mildred. -Don't hug me, George. -Hi, Auntie Mildred. -Margaret. Oh, my. How you've grown. Well, finally we can eat. We thought something happened to you. I told you not to hold things up for us. Well, we weren't gonna eat without you. Thank you for that dram of consideration. Well, maybe you could return the favor one year and be on time. Come on. Come on. She's here now. So let's eat before we all starve to death, okay? Auntie Mildred, you wanna come see my dollhouse? Yes, I would. Well, it's not really a dollhouse. It's just furniture, beds, chairs, and tables. Come on. I'll show you. George, for the fifth time, would you move -your ice cream truck? -Oh, sorry, Pearl. -Uncle George. -Marty. And with a beautiful woman. Well, it's about time. We were all starting to think that you were one brick short of a man-sized load. I'm not with Martin. I'm Mildred's housekeeper. Thanks a lot. But I have slept with him, and believe me, he has all the bricks he needs. What? Well, whatever makes you happy. I got to move my truck. Jean. What was that all about? Just looking out for your reputation. Hi, Marty, will you take a look at this for me? Look, right here on my back. What is it? Same as last year. It's a mole. Nothing's changed. -Oh. -So I think you'll be okay. Martin, I feel so much better now. Oh, Jack's got something on his foot. -I'll go get him. -Great. I'll be here. Ooh. You're right, it is a little swollen. That sounds okay. All right. Now, deep breath. Good. And again. Well, sounds fine. All right. Next. All right. Have a seat. Let me give you a hand with that. How come you're not married? I was in love with a man once, when I needed him, he went away. Is that why you're so mad all the time? Well, maybe. But you be careful. Falling in love is dangerous. Men can hurt your feelings. Margaret, why don't you come and help me in the kitchen? I think you've heard enough from your Auntie Mildred for one day. -Bye. -Mm. -You okay? -Yeah. I was thinking about Tony. You should give that up, you know. Mm. Remember the day you and Tony collected all the rotten tomatoes out of Pearl's garden, and heaved them at the Higgen's shed? -Oh, they were so mad at you. -Yeah, I remember. Just like brothers. And you were like a father to us both. -Hmm? -Mm-hmm. It's nice to see you again, Martin. Makes me imagine what Tony would have been like if he'd had a chance to grow up. Hard to believe it's been 20 years. Yeah. So, uh, how are things with you and your mother? How they've always been. You should have a life, you know. A wife, family. You can't look after her forever. I know, I know. You have no right coming into my house and saying things like that. Don't walk away while I'm talking to you, Mildred. I'm your sister for God's sake. I did not come here to be shouted at. Well, if you spent a little less time dressing like Mrs. Oscar de la Renta. Well, at least I don't look like I just came off a Vegas junket. Martin, find Jean. We're going home. Mom, I'm not going anywhere until I've had something to eat and a chance to visit with everyone. Fine. You have your little visit. I'll wait out here, because I don't have any friends in there. Well, good. Good. You just stay out here because you're not gonna ruin my party again this year, Mildred. Aunt Pearl, what's happened? Your mother's got a big mouth, Martin. Now, we've all had to learn how to put up with that, but I will not tolerate her lying to my grandchildren, especially considering... Considering what? Considering the lie she told about your father. He was a nice man, Martin. And she was a fool for leaving him. Wait a second. You knew my father? I think I'll freshen up my drink. I'm so-- Honey, I'm sorry. I-- I had no right to mouth off like that. I, uh... It's just that she gets me so angry I forget my own man-- Oh, God. I'm sorry. I... -Mom-- -Whatever she said it's a lie. Pearl knew my father. I thought you said-- She met him. She didn't know him. I thought you said he died before you came here? Never mind what Pearl said. Your father died, and I had to get a job, and be a mother and a father to you. And that's all you need to know. Where you going? Whoa! Mildred, I brought you some food. Thank you, Jean. You know, I think Pearl would be much happier if you came inside and joined the party. She made her choice and I made mine. Now, you just run along back inside. Watch over Martin. Don't let anybody hurt his feelings. He's very sensitive, you know, like his mother. Now, run along. Milly, come inside for God's sake. Don't drag this out anymore. Put an end to it now. Pearl doesn't want me here. She only invited me because I'm her sister and she feels she has too. You want me to sit with you a while? Just run along. I'll be fine. Hey, Pearl, everybody's having a great time. Come on. You're missing all the fun. -Now, what are you doing? -What am I doing? I'm doing the tango. What do you think I'm doing? I'm working in here by myself. I feel like a widow, Wesley. Look, do you want some help? I don't want any help. I want you to do it. I need a drink. Come on, Aunt Mildred, don't be such an old goat. What? What did you say? I said, "Don't be such an old goat." Oh, that's very disrespectful. You know better than to talk that way, Tony Miller. You know, it's funny. And it never ceases to amaze me that one miserable person has the power to ruin it for everyone. I did not ruin this party. Oh, you have no idea what a mess you made of this party. Now, are you coming under your own steam or do I have to drag you? What do you think you're doing, Tony Miller? Wait a minute. You-- You can't be here. You're dead. Yeah, well, you're one to talk. Who is that? I think you already know the answer to that one. I'd hand it to her. She's got real staying power. How long do you think she'll keep it up? Past the end of the party and well into the night. This is very strange. I went out for some Mr. Lucky's fried chicken. Well, uh, that-- Well, I didn't even see the truck. I-- I was just making a left turn. I have to get home to tutor. She's waiting for the chicken. Shut up, please, will you? What's happened to me? Where am I? Is this a dream? You had a stroke. Ah, I'm in the hospital. A fatal stroke. You mean... Are you sure? Pretty sure. You see, Aunt Mildred, this is kind of a waiting room. People who have something that they've left unresolved at life come here until they figure out how to fix it. Then what? Then they move on. Do you remember how you got here? I was at Pearl's house, in the garden, in the chair, and then you came. But... Oh, yes. Oh, dear. Yes. I do remember. I am dead, aren't I? I... Wish I'd had time to say goodbye to Martin. He's such a nice boy. I have some things I wanted to tell him. Like what? None of your business. What now? Well, it's different for everybody, but you're catching on. You'll figure it out. Wait! -Hi, Larry, how are you? -Good, good. Good. Martin. I just feel so guilty about having left her out there alone for so long. Maybe if I checked up on her, I could've saved her. Ah, don't torture yourself like that, Marty. She had a massive stroke. She didn't even fall out of the chair. So there was no suffering. There's nothing any of us could've done in that situation. - Martin. - Maybe you're right. Martin, look out! Get down! Get down, get down. -Are you all right? -Yeah. -You okay? -I'm okay. Security, seal all exits. Wait. Let me have a look. You'll be okay. Okay. Come-- Nurse, get a gurney. What made you turn around? I don't know. Well, I owe you one. What happened to my stone? Tell me where it is. I'll die before I tell you. I don't have to kill you. The Ise diamond is mine and you'll tell me where it is. You've made an excellent decision, Dr. Mallory, in choosing Marble Gardens. Our facilities offer the dearly departed a sense of tranquility unavailable anywhere else. So, is that what all these spitting gargoyles and marble urns are all about? To make the dead feel more tranquil? Uh, yes, exactly. Well, in my work, I see a lot of dead people, Mister, uh... -Whippet. -Whippet. -Yes. -Whippet. And I've got to tell you, I think they're pretty tranquil all by themselves. Oh. Well, you know, it's not just for the deceased, Dr. Mallory. No, no, no. We offer peace and harmony to the surviving relatives as well. Take a look around you. Don't you feel serene? Don't you feel at rest? Well, actually, I feel as if I got here a little too early. Is there a place that maybe I could sit down and wait for the others? Yes. Yes, sir. Right this way. What's going on? What is she doing here? She's supposed to be in the chapel. I can't get this out of her hand. What? What-- What is it? It's a stone or something. Do you want me to break her fingers? No, no, then I'll just have to fix them and we don't have time. Listen, all right. All right, let me do this. Okay. You just put that there and we'll hide it with this hand, okay? No one will ever notice. Oh, more lipstick. I want her lips to come alive. Oh, Mom. It's gonna be so quiet around here without you driving everyone crazy. Martin. We're almost finished here, Marty. Just got a couple of loose ends to tie up. Yeah, while we're here, would you like us to do some liposuction? Cut it out, guys. Dr. Cavanaugh, they're here. Ah, don't move, we'll be right back. -Who's here? -Cappuccino, want one? Hey, guys. I've got a funeral to go to. Ah, two minutes, we'll be right back, Marty. What are you looking at? We decided not to have the service at the chapel. They're having the whole thing at the graveyard, and they're waiting for you. Look, I know what you're thinking, but... she was standing right beside me, I... I took a good long look at her, she was there. Yeah, well, I know how you feel. Because sometimes grief can make you see all kinds of things that you never thought were there. No, she was there, Jean. I saw her, she was there. Oh, nasty. Sorry. It's okay. I brought your suit. You think I'm nuts, don't you? No, I think you're stressed out. Your mother died, you survived a shootout at your own hospital. It has to be affecting you. -On the other hand... -What? It is possible that you did see your mother's ghost. So you do believe? Of course I believe, I'm Irish. Are you sure these are all the names and addresses of the doctors and nurses who attended the surgery on the gunshot victim? That's the only list we have. They all have to sign in before the surgery. Can I have a copy of it? Sure. Well, the doctor say how long? Well, I don't-- What'd you hear? I phoned. He's on his way. -Oh, good. Fine. -Pearl. Oh, all right. Okay, good. They're here. All right. All right, everybody, let's go, come on. I'm sorry. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Sorry. Uh, I'm sorry I kept you all waiting so long. It was, uh... Please. We gather here today to mourn the passing of Mildred Mallory. We pray that as she enters into her eternal wholeness and rest that those of us who remain may find healing and peace. We are especially grateful for the memory of Mildred, who by her warm, endearing, and caring ways, deeply enriched the lives of her family and friends. Each of you has special memories of Mildred that you will cherish forever. And so in a real sense, she will have a sanctuary in your hearts. Mildred will live on in the hearts and minds of us who knew-- Who knew and loved her. It's not here. We go! Let us pray. Gracious God, we need strong comfort amid the perplexity and sorrows of life. Now we commit Mildred's earthly remains to the elements from which they came. Dust to dust... ashes to ashes... in the sure and certain hope of life eternal. - Jean. - Make us grateful -that we are upheld... -What? ...and supported by the above. Look over there. ...and make us receptive to... Where? Straight ahead. Behind the preacher. Beside the tree. What? Don't you see anything? Oh, God of the living, make real to us now and all of life's tomorrows. The abiding presence of those... No. ...we have known and loved. Foster in us, interior companionships... -Come on, let's get out of here. -...growing company of those... Come on, let's get out of here. ...we have loved and lost. Excuse me. Excuse me. So our lives may be enriched. And that those who are dead may yet speak. Eternal God, we seek you in this hour of sorrow... Not because by seeking... You saw her again, didn't you? No. ...make us grateful... - Let's walk for a minute. - Oh, God. Amen. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. I just thought it would be a good idea if we walked for a minute. Don't run from her. If you see her, let's talk to her. I don't see her and I'm not run... There! Sitting on the tombstone. Shh, I didn't say anything. - You don't see her? - No, I don't see her. Okay, then what? Am I insane? No. Call to her, ask her to come over. Okay. Mom, Mom. Louder. Mom! Is she looking at you? Well, no. Well, yeah. Sort of. She's looking right through me. Call her again. Mom. Mom, come on. Mom, don't ignore me. Is she any closer? She's gone. This must be his mother. She's on the list. We must find out where she lives. Strike. What are you doing? Oh, what does it look like I'm doing? Wasting time. Oh, Tony, honey, I'm dead. And I've never bowled better. You have a task to perform. Huh, is that so? And because you're not performing, you separated into two parts. Well, I hope the other part of me is having as much fun as I am. Your etheric double is back down there scaring the pants off your son. It won't hurt him, will it? No, because it's you. It's the husker shell of your spirit. But it needs this part or it can't perform the task. Think about your task and it will come to you. -No. -Try a little harder. Niagara Falls. Now you're getting it. What's the big hurry? I hate it when he does that. You see her? Right over there. Hold on, hold on. I'm coming. I heard that. But it didn't come from her. Don't pay any attention to her. She's just a husk. Ah, there. That's better. -Do you see that? -Yes. Stop that whispering. But you're dead. Of course I'm dead. Who do you think you buried? Marge Simpson? I don't believe this. I'm the real Mildred. That other was my etheric double. They call it a husk, but that's not important. What's important is you have to dig up my body and bury it in Niagara Falls. What? That's it? Ghosts are supposed to come back with an important message. But, no, my mother comes back to make a change in travel plans. Just do it. It's very important. Hello, Jean, I didn't mean to ignore you, but I'm not sure just how much longer I can stay with you now. What's it like? What happens after you die? Well, so far, it's pretty much of a no frills trip. I was in a waiting room, I went bowling. That's all I've seen so far. You went bowling? Wait. Mom, wait. Mom. Did that just happen or am I crazy? Oh, wasn't it fantastic? I wonder why she wants her body moved to Niagara Falls. I don't know. But if I were you, I'd do it. This is a real spirit, and she's got a mission. Yeah, but I haven't got a clue of what's involved in exhuming a body and moving it halfway across the country. You better do it. Martin, this isn't like picking up a quart of milk for me at the store. This is big. If I could, I'd do it myself but I can't, I'm dead. I-- I need your help. Now, move my body to Niagara Falls. And you have three days to do it or else... Or else what? Or else, I may be with you forever. Oh, no. Uh, do you think she's coming back? I don't know. Well, what am I supposed to do now? I guess we better start our mission. We? Things happen for a reason. And I'm here because I'm supposed to be here. Martin, this is one of those very rare adventures that comes along once in a lifetime. We have to do it. Okay. Uh, okay. Quiet. This is the driver from Marble Gardens Mortuary, Dr. Mallory. We need to know if we can pick you up at this address or from your late mother's former address over on Crestview. Crestview. We go. This is Ms. Mandel from Dr. Wobblestern's office to confirm your dentist's appointment tomorrow morning at 10:30. You're way past your six months. I hope you've been flossing. You're not gonna like this. She had the stone all right, but she's dead. And they buried her with it. Get in. Go. -Oh. -Hey, that's the glass I broke. You're jinxed. Dr. Mallory. This is Jean Connolly. Uh, yes, yes. All right. Let's go. I trust you're here to tell us that you're all better from your fall and that there'll be no serious legal consequences for us. We all know how expensive it is when doctors get hurt. Uh, no. I wanna move my mother. Oh? Well, why would you wanna do that? She has wonderful neighbors. The entire Robinson family on one side and the Wiltern couple on the other. I should think she would be very happy right where she is. Well, she's not. Uh, we wanna see what's involved in moving her body to, uh, another city. Well, why didn't you say so. All right, let's see. Ah, Florida. Now, we've got a lot of happy customers down there at our sister resting ground, the Ponce de Leon Marble Gardens. Well, she'll make a lot of new friends down there. And when you visit her, well, it's more than just a grave site visit. We have recreational villas for the whole family right on the grounds. So you can mourn while the kids hit the water slide. Fish cove, grieve, snorkel, tennis, mourn. No, we wanna move her to Niagara Falls. Well, uh, we don't have anything in Niagara, uh... Oh, well, then I guess we'll just have to find someone else to help us move her. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, we can find a place and make an arrangement. -You know, it-- It's just-- -What? Well, a little more expensive that way. How much? I mean, how much to get her moved immediately? Well, immediately? Well, no, time. We need time. You see, we've got to contact the health department. We've got to get all the necessary permits here. Uh, arrange for refrigerated transportation. Get the permits in Niagara Falls. Well, how long? It could take a month. A month? No. That's too long. -Uh, is that too long? -I think so. That's too long. No, well, m-- Maybe three weeks, you know, but I can't guarantee it. May-- May I ask what the reason for the rush is? Uh, we had a special request from the deceased. Well, I hope it wasn't a personal visit. Look, Mr. Whippet, I don't think you realize the urgency of this matter. I mean, what do we have to do to get her body moved today? You get a couple of shovels and you dig her up yourself. You know, I can't believe we're doing this. I feel like such a ghoul. Don't talk like that. You're giving me the willies. Does that mean you're scared? Terrified. Of what? Seeing a ghost? We already saw a ghost this afternoon. The worse that can happen is we see a ghost we don't recognize. Here we are. All right. Give me that. I guess, I'll go first. No, no, no, no. I said I'd help you and I will. You got to save your strength for the end. What's at the end? You have to get that casket out. Hold it. That thing weighs over a thousand pounds. Uh, we'll just leave the casket here -and take the body. -You're right. You can buy another casket in Niagara Falls. Yeah. What? I paid over $5,000 for that casket. Uh, you're right. We'll find some way to get her on the truck. Start digging. You know, you're in good shape. Get rid of the shovels. We'll let them do all the work. My butt hurts. I don't think they got all the glass out. Hey. Tempura. I can't believe how hard it is to dig a hole in the ground. My back's killing me. Shut up and dig, will you? I got it! I got it. I hit the top of the coffin. Okay. I'm getting out. Uh, wait. Uh, me too. No. You keep digging. I'll go get the truck. Are you sure you know how to drive the truck? Okay. Okay. I was just asking. What the hell? ♪ Bingo's ice cream cone ♪ Bingo's cone ♪ Bingo's ice cream cone ♪ ♪ Bingo's ice cream cone There is a button that says music on it! Well, I didn't see it, did I? Okay. Okay. Let's not yell at each other. With any luck, there's a chain and a winch kit at the back that will help us pull the casket out. That's just great! That's just fantastic! This has got to be the only truck in the world that doesn't have a winch and a chain thing on it. How the hell am I supposed to pull a thousand-pound casket out of the ground by hand? This is just great! Fantastic! -Will a rope work? -A rope? A rope's good. A rope's good. Okay. Okay. So, you just tie your end to that handle up there. Here. And I'll tie my end to the casket handle. And then you floor it. And that should just flip the casket out of the grave, and lean it against the truck, and then we'll just slide it in. Yeah. That will work. Are you sure? You're the driver. I'm the engineer. You just drive. Go on. Okay. Okay. Now, floor it. Good. Good. Yeah. That's it. It worked. Of course it worked. I knew it would work. Come on. Come on. It's too heavy. No. Just one more time. Come on. You can do it. Come on. What is it? What? Uh, this isn't the way it looks. Uh, we're not really grave robbers. You're the gardener's son. Wait. That's my mother. I know. -My condolences. -Thank you. Obviously, you miss her very much. Perhaps I could help you and your mother get back together again. -Get in the hole. -You've got to be kidding. -Get in the hole. -Oh, sure. A bunch of guys I've never seen before in my life, telling me to jump in a hole and steal my mother's body? Oh, that makes perfect logical sense to me! Get a hold of yourself. They've got guns. I can see that. Excuse me. Fill it in. Oh, brilliant. You're not gonna bury us alive, are you? Wait. Let's go. You hit me. What the hell was that about? They just stole my mother. Go after them. They're getting away. Oh, look. I knew it was you. You desecrated a body, broke the law. You! You can't be here. Uh, no. I, uh-- I embalmed you myself. You're a... You're a... zombie! Zombie! -Come on. -Come on. Now, here-- Here's your car. Now, get my body. -I'll meet you there. -Come on. I'm a doctor, not a secret agent. Look out! Where is Kaga? What the hell? Mom? Mom, what happened? Oh, I scared the pants off them. You know, I'm beginning to enjoy this. Me too. Good. Fine. I'm glad you're both having fun. You know, those guys were Japanese. The guy I operated on, he was Japanese too. Now, that's how racism starts. Just because they're Japanese is no reason to-- You know, it's that stone. That's what they're after. The guy was hiding it in his mouth. I mean, they must think we have it. Why would anybody go to all that trouble for an ordinary little beach pebble? Well then, why are they chasing us, huh? What do they want? And what the hell do they want with your body? That's not very nice. I may be dead, but some people may still find me attractive. You know, I haven't seen them for two hours. Are you hungry? How about some eggs? No. -Pancakes? -No. What are you asking her for? She's dead. Well, pardon me for not being part of your little clique of the living. You know, I think I'd rather sleep than eat. Why don't we find a place to stop for a few hours? That's a good idea. Sleep tight, Ma. Okay. Thanks. Let's go to the office. -I want a fudgesicle. -What? I'd like a popsicle and an ice cream sandwich, please. What are you guys talking about? -Do you have any drumsticks? -No. Now, get out of here. Oh, yeah. Um, we've sold out. Um... Uh, truck's being repaired. Look, I'm not an ice cream man. Well, which is it, you're sold out, getting the truck fixed, or you're not an ice cream man? Uh, take your pick. Now, buzz off. Yeah. Right. He's got ice cream in there. Well... here we are. One-o-four. One-o-five. Well, just tap on the door when you're ready to go. Um... have a nice sleep. Oh, great. Now we're scaring each other. I thought it was a closet. Yeah. I was gonna have a nap in the closet too. Look, uh, do you wanna... Yes. How could a girl resist your charms? You get an ice cream truck, dig up a body, check into a nice place like this. I'd do anything for you. Would you mind helping me with my boots then? Yeah. That's a start. So where am I supposed to sleep? I can't believe-- Mother, you-- You and I need a little chat. Don't lose that thought, huh? Come with me. -Aren't you ashamed? -No, I'm not. I'm just doing what any normal man does when he's attracted to a very special woman. Well, she's not your woman. She's my woman. She works for me. Come off it, Mom. You're dead. -D-E-A, dead. -How can you say that to me? Do you think it's easy being D-E-A-D, dead? Listen to me. You ran my life when you were alive. I'm not gonna let you do it anymore. I sacrificed everything for you. I was father and mother to you. So what is that, huh? A debt I have to pay off for the rest of my life? I mean, I can't have a happy relationship with a woman because you never had one with my father? You're right. I'm sorry. What is that? What? Some kind of trick? No. Jean is a nice girl. And you deserve to be happy. Go on. And I promise I won't leave this room. Okay. Okay. I'll check in on you later. And you really ought to take a bath. It's time to play Bet the Bundle. And here's your host, Bob and Lana. Over there. You must guess each other's secret phrases in order to qualify for the big bundle grand prizes. It's... So you're gonna get the ice cream? -What? -You know, the ice cream? We'd like some too. There's no ice cream here. Get lost. Yeah, right. We know there's ice cream in there. Yeah. Give us some ice cream. Get the hell out of here or I'll break your necks. Now, guesses do not have to be literal... ...and be in the same language. Contestants with... They've come to steal my body. If you are or any of your family want tickets forBet the Bundle contact your local priest, rabbi, minister, or a nun for details. Well, let's get the game... Hmm? Mildred, a single mother, originally from Harrisburg. But more recently, you've been dead for four days. That's right, Bob. Okay. Now, Mildred. You have $10,000, the luggage, and the freezer. Are you going to gamble it all that Dennis Lambert is going to get your secret phrase? I'll risk it all, Bob. What have I got to lose? I'm dead. Okay. Now, we're gonna show the audience at home Mildred's secret phrase. The phrase today is... Martin, get up quick! They're trying to steal my body. Martin, get up quick! They're trying to steal my body. Now, remember, big bundle prize winners will fly to Hawaii on Air Extraordinaire. All flights depart for Hawaii on Monday and arrive home... -They're there. -Where? ...leaving the weekends free... -Right outside. -What are we gonna do? Uh, let's go out this way. Grab the clothes. My wife doesn't understand me. What can you do? ...go to commercial. -Who is it? -Room service. -Thank you. -What the hell? Hey, where's our food? The rooms have to be checked before the food arrives. It looks great. Thank you. ...wanna thank John in our graphics... Whoa. I don't know who they were. What's going on here? Look. Mildred, you've just won a 1994 Lexicord Cygnet. I don't believe it. Oh, that's nothing. Sometimes they get trips to Hawaii. Even cruises all around the world. You hit something. -Whoa. -Cool. Well, I'm not gonna stop and leave a note. Come on. Awesome. Congratulations. You've just won a $10,000 Hawaiian vaca... What's going on here? Bob? Come on, Aunt Mildred. You've got work to do. Oh, I can't stop now. I just won that beautiful automobile, a trip to Hawaii, and I'm going for the home entertainment center. But you've got to help them. They're in great danger. Is this all about my stupid, little pebble? Why don't I just give it to those dumb jerks? No. Don't let it go until it's time. Well, when will it be time? I'm sick of all this. I want some laughs. When you get to Niagara Falls. Niagara Falls. Niagara Falls. I was supposed to be married there. -Martin's father. -Your husband. -He never married me. -You took his name. Listen, kid. I had to. I was pregnant. That's what this is all about. I'm taking Martin to see his father. And you have less than six hours to do it. Okay. Let's go. We have about four hours to meet Mildred's deadline. Oh, who cares about Mildred's deadline? See if they're following us. I don't see them. Well, they're coming. Believe me. All we did was delay them, but... Better get off the main road. How about we get rid of this truck? It makes us way too easy to spot. We need the truck to carry the body. Yeah. Well, that was the idea before people with guns started chasing us. Now we have other priorities, like staying alive. I heard that. Well, I don't care if you heard it, Mother. Things have changed. Now we're going to the police. What are you gonna tell them? That you're a doctor, and your dead mother told you to dig her up? Don't be silly, Martin. They'll think you're a lunatic and a grave robber. She's right, Martin. When you were a little boy, you trusted me. Now I'm asking you to trust me just one more time. Get my body to Niagara Falls, and get it there by noon and everything will be all right. So I'm just supposed to trust you? Just this one last time. Okay. Niagara. Left here. Now! Now, go straight ahead. Ah. Here. Turn down this street. So where are we going? Turn right here. Okay, Mrs. Houdini. Now what? I can't concentrate with your being a smart-ass. Is that it? Yes. Right here. Okay. Okay. This is it. This is it, right here. Go ahead. Buzz it. Can I help you? Uh, yes. This is Martin Mallory. Oh, come in, Dr. Mallory. Try and get that vertebrae cataloged, 114. You're, uh, making a delivery? Uh, yeah. Actually, uh, I am. Uh, I think this is the right place. I've got a dead body in the back. Oh. Well, uh, you're lucky to get him. He's leaving on an expedition in a couple hours. He won't be back for six months. Would someone tell me what's going on? -You go along. -What? You bring us all the way to Niagara Falls and now you're leaving us? -Just go. -This way please, hmm. Come on. Trust her. -Dr. Mallory? -Yes. Someone here to see you. Mildred. -Dr. Mallory. -Yes? -Dr. Mallory. -Yes. -Oh, I'm Martin Mallory. -No, I'm Martin Mallory. -What a coincidence. -What a coincidence. -And you are? -Jean. -Jean Mallory? -Connolly. Oh. Yes. -Mildred sent us. -Mildred? She's my mother. Where is your mother? -She's-- -She's dead. She died four days ago. Oh, I am sorry. Truly very sorry. Did you know Mildred? I knew a Mildred. When were you born? February 16th, 1958. February 16th. Why? That's not your birthday too, is it? He's your father, you donut brain. My father? No. My father died when... I didn't know we had a son. Mildred left... -You're not blind? -No. I'm just touching your face. How did you find me? It's a long story. And, frankly, I don't know if you'd believe me. Try me. Hey. Did you see a van? Let me have a moment alone with her. Of course. Thank you, Mildred. Thank you for bringing him to me. Is that an apology? Don't be frightened, Martin. You're used to dead bodies. That's what you left me for. Remember? To go dig up old bones. -It's amazing. -It's me. I'm here. Why didn't you let me know we had a son? You left. I thought you didn't want me. Well, let's not talk about that now, Martin. Are you married? Never did. How about you? No. I had offers, but none of them seemed as right as you could've been. So I devoted my life to bringing up my son. Our son. Come on, Aunt Mildred. It's time. I'm sorry, Martin. It's time for me to go. No. No. It's not time for you to go. It's time for you to give him the stone. But it's mine. It's my lucky stone. Who are you talking to? Give it to him. Your task is complete. Well, all right. I'm supposed to give you this pebble. It's been nothing but a nuisance to me. Goodbye. Take care of our boy. I promise. Where you think it's from? Did she speak to you? Yes. And she gave me this. Her lucky stone. Uh, this isn't a stone at all. It's-- This is... Good Lord. I can't believe it. I believe this is the Ise Stone. It's... It's beautiful. Is it valuable? It's the most valuable diamond in the world. Well, does that mean we're rich? Well, I have to do some tests. Tests won't be necessary. I will be happy to confirm that you're holding the real Ise Stone. Now, give it to me. This is the trouble I was talking about. Shut up. Do something. You've got to stop it. I can't stop it. I didn't go to all the trouble bringing Martin to meet his father just so he'd be killed. Wait. You can't interfere with the course of human events. Give me the stone and no one will be harmed. Don't be ridiculous. This is a religious relic. It has no street value. It belongs in a museum. You try my patience, old man. The stone belongs to me. No. -Concentrate, Aunt Mildred. -I can't. Yes, you can. There! Did you see that? Yes, I did. Give us the stone. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Heavenly Father, please accept onto thy bosom the soul of our dearly departed Mildred Mallory. Amen. -Amen. -Amen. Do you mind if I have a minute alone with her? Well, don't be too long. You have a lot of catching up to do with your living relative. We'll wait at the car. I don't know if you can hear me, Mom. I just want you to know that I understand. I understand about you and Dad. And why you were always so angry. It's funny the way things work out. I got to know you. And I think I liked you best when you were dead. Don't be so morbid. Mom, I thought your spirit was finally at rest. You know what they say, no rest for the wicked. What do you mean? I mean, I have to work. You have to work after you're dead? Oh, some of us do. My job is to get some newly departed nitwits to face up to their lives. I'm gonna meet one right here in about half an hour. Basket case. Refuses to believe she's dead. So, uh, am I going to be seeing you around? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I'll be around. Jean? Dad? She's back. She's back. Oh, yes. Yes. I'm back.
