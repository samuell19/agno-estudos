Could I ask you first of all what the inspiration for the series was? The inspiration? Yeah, it was a birthday. I was coming up to 40 and we found out that Richard Briers was also coming up to 40. So, John and I, John Esmonde, we started talking about being 40. And said, it's one of those "Oh, God!" ages. It's, "Oh, God, what's gone wrong?" And "Oh, God, where have I got to?" 'Oh, God, where am I going?" So we started with the idea of a man on his 40th birthday, just totally fed up with doing what he did, finding it nonsensical and silly. And we said, "What if he wanted to break out? What if he wanted to have a little revolution? What would he do?" And you get into the sailing round the world, or living on a desert island. We discarded those. And just said self-sufficiency, it just came as an idea. But it came second to being 40. And in self-sufficiency, we thought this was a bloke who had thought he'd found a way out of the rat race. That was the inspiration. Had you ever lived that way yourself? (Chuckling) No, no, no. Nowhere near it. - Not even tried it? - No, nor had Richard Briers. How did the partnership with John evolve? Well, John and I, we'd been friends since school, which is a long, long time ago. We used to play football together and we used to laugh together and all the rest of it. Then we did National Service and some office jobs, which we hated. And also weren't very good at. And we just started writing. Evenings and weekends, we used to write sketches and send them everywhere, and get them all back. Then we used to send them all off to somebody else and get them all back. We sort of hammered away for... I don't know... two or three years. Then, bit by bit, we started to sell stuff. It started with radio, just radio sketches. And it went from there. I think it was easy, in a way, that we shared really an almost identical sense of humour. Almost exactly the same things made us laugh. So working together was easy from the start. It wasn't like an arranged marriage. How involved do you, as a writer, stay with the production? Not honestly terribly long. We found experience taught us... ...it's best to be there on the first day rehearsal, the first read-through, because that's generally the time that any cracks are going to show. Or questions are going to be asked. And at that point, the writers can get useful. After that, we found that writers actually just get in the way. So that's about the total involvement, unless anything went wrong in the week. In which case we were on hand. But, as you know, it's such a quick turnaround, a comedy series. It is just a week, so by and large it's got to be fairly right from the start. How about casting? How involved are you, given that this series is very much an ensemble piece? How involved were you in the casting process? John Howard Davies who directed it and produced it, was very good, he liked the writers involved. He liked to talk about how we saw the characters, what sort of people we thought they'd be. So we were involved but not perhaps overly helpful. Richard Briers was already there. The BBC brief was that they were looking to bring Richard Briers back to a situation comedy. So we knew about Richard. The only helpful suggestion we made was Penny Keith. But to our eternal shame, we didn't identify her as a considerably good stage actress and television actress. We identified her as a girl in the Benson & Hedges commercial. And we couldn't even remember her name! We said, "What about the girl in the television commercial?" There's a chap smoking next to her at a dinner table. And the smoke drifts, and Penny goes, "Oh!" And then goes, "Oh, Benson & Hedges." And we said instantly, "It's Margo, it's Margo!" That isn't why they cast her. But that was about as helpful as we were. There's a fundamental fondness between the characters in this particular series. Do you think this is a major factor in the success of this particular show? I think it was. When we discussed it, we got the Tom and Barbara characters. We said, "These are the crazy couple who are going to try this business." To make it funny, there must be opposition. You can't have everybody all thinking what a wonderful idea it is. So opposition equals neighbours, somebody looking over the fence and disapproving. And [ think we were wise to say that they should be friends first. They liked the Goods, they were their best friends, although they disapproved of what they were doing. If we'd have just made them angry snooty neighbours, I think it would have been a very short life. Because Tom and Barbara Good would have said, "Just go away. Leave us alone." But the fact that they were friends made it more interesting. As a person, if you're friends with somebody but disapprove of what they're doing, it's got some depth to it. I think that added to it. I think that the whole premise of the story... allowed for a lot of romance between Tom and Barbara, especially. Would you call yourself a romantic? In that sense, I must be. Yes, yes. Actually, they were a very sexy couple, Tom and Barbara. She was always saying things like, "Shall we have an early night?" He would say, "Are you tired?" And she'd say, "No." There'd be this wonderful glow of recognition before he followed her out. Yes, I think so. The idea wouldn't have worked, the series wouldn't have worked, had they not been a loving and romantic couple. If they'd have been at odds, the whole thing, in real life, would have collapsed within weeks. Do you watch any of the comedy shows that come in from America? Yes, I do. I've liked a lot of American comedy. I think American comedy takes a bit of a bashing sometimes from the press. They forget the fact that they produce so much comedy. I mean, they produce masses and masses and masses of it. And some of it is absolutely awful. But the best... l mean, I think are absolutely as good as anything. I mean, shows like Frasier... which I think is now going off because I think it's been going too long... But wonderful. That was a little oasis of sort of civilisation. Seinfeld - we're still watching repeats of Seinfeld, which ended four years ago, which I just think is as funny as anything I've ever seen. 'A show about nothing," as Jerry Seinfeld says. They're my favourite American ones. Before that, Cheers, M*A*S*H - way back. A lot of very good stuff. Was it a great surprise to you that The Good Life, known in America as Good Neighbours, should be such a huge success? Yes, it was. It was. I'd have thought it was too British. I couldn't aspire to Ealing Comedies, but there's something of that kind of British eccentricity about it, about doing self-sufficiency, not in the country but in your back garden, the whole thing. I'd have thought it was too British, too English. But apparently not. Apparently not. They seem to like the quirkiness. And, again, I think the... - which is possibly its international appeal, is that it's two people trying to do something about their lives, trying to make their life better, without hurting anybody else. It was a very peaceful revolution. They dropped out... ...in slang. But, I mean, they dropped out to do something. They didn't just drop out to moan about it. I think that's got something which maybe appeals to almost anybody. I don't know. It must have been huge fun writing it, because the possibilities within that premise are endless. - It was terrific. - It must have been hilarious. It was great fun. But the opportunities weren't endless. In fact, that's why we stopped it. We'd written... I don't know, 28, something like that, John and I. It was going great guns and very popular but we realised that we were starting to run out of stories about self-sufficiency. When you've done a second pig story, you think there's only so many stories you can do about pigs. You know. They've had a litter. A second litter isn't as funny as the first litter. We were literally beginning to run out of ideas actually to do with self-sufficiency. And [ think, had we gone on, it would have become a series about two sets of neighbours. Which is perfectly nice, but is perfectly ordinary. As long as it had something to do with that back garden and what was going in it, going on in I, it was the series. So I think perhaps we were wise to quit when we did.
