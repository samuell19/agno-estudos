Hey! Hey! Officer, I have a restraining order against that man, right there! You stay away from me! I m so sick and tired of listening to you bother me... Jack, I m just asking you to help out a little... When I come home, I want to have a drink, I don t want to listen to any of this crap. No, I'm not... You understand me? I said n. Jack, please! Is that crystal clear to you? And where are the girls? Jack, calm down! Who told the girls they could leave this house? Calm down, alright? I made it crystal clear I wantd them to clean their room before they went out for ice cream. They haven t done anything wrong, okay? Now where are they? Jack! You let them walk where? Jack, it was just for ice cream. Princess... Hey, come give Daddy a big hug. Come here! Daddy just won a big case. Come here Princess, give me a hug. Let her go! You shut up. You know, you re just like your mother. Jack, leave them alone! Come on, girls. Get back over here. Hey! Don t you walk away from me, get over here. Get over here! Get back here, girls. Alright, come on. Get back here, now! You get in your room, okay? Get in your room, okay? Jack, you need to leave them alone. Leave them alone... why would I leave them alone? Those are my girls? You re scaring them. I'm scaring them... Am I scaring you girls, huh? Am I scaring you? Jack, you need to... You get in your rooms, okay? Don t you turn your back on me. Mom! Do you swear to tell the whole truth, so help you God? Yes, I do. Mr. Locke... Where were you on December 5th? I was with my father at a charity event. And would you mind telling the court who your father is? Why? I don't see... My father is Governor Barry Locke. What time did you guys get home? It was, uh, it was around 11:00 P.M. And you have evidence to corroborate that? A security camera saw my father and I leave the event. Uh, that evidence has been submitted. Yes it has, but that security camera has you leaving at, uh... 9:35. We went and had dinner on the way back from the event. He s corroborated my story. Yes, why don t you just tell me what happened when you got home? I, uh... I heard yelling coming from the house. And... I went in through the garage and saw... a man... at the top of the stairs with my wife. He was wearing a... mask and holding a knife. They struggled and, uh... when I cried out... When I cried out, he pushed her and she fell down the steps. I ran over and I, and I... and I tried to save her but it was too late. She, she... she hit her head on the floor. I didn t know what to do. Um... no, you didn't know what to do. You didn t know to call the police. You didn't do that for another 45 minutes. I went after the intruder. Did you? Yes. Mr. Locke, there s no evidence of an intruder. There s no sign of forced entry or footsteps around the house... except yours. And there s no fingerprints inside the house, there's really nothing... except your bloody fingerprints from when you moved the body. He exists! An intruder pushed my wife down the steps and I watched her die. D.A. Winters... No more questions, your honour. Prosecution calls, um... Roberta Flores... Mr. Locke s, uh, maid. I would never hurt my wife! You ve got the wrong guy! Mr. Locke, please step down. My name is Roberta Flores. I was, uh, Mr. and Miss Locke s maid for five years. And did you live with Mr. Locke? I lived in the guest house. I would also help with the children. And were you home on December 5th? Yes. I was there. You keep looking at the defendant, Ms. Flores... does he scare you? No, ma am. I wasn t looking at Mr. Locke. Hi Princess. Continue D.A. Winters. Yes, um... sorry, just... um... D.A. Winters... Yes, um, I need a second. Ms. Flores, um... I'm sorry, I need to interrupt. Would jurors five, seven and eleven please stand? I have here an affidavit from your lawyers stating that you were contacted outside this room by a representative of the District Attorney's office... What? What s going on? I don t know. Quiet! The letter also states that you were selected for this jury in an effort by the D.A. to secure a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree against the defendant. Your honour, we did nothing of the sort. This is the first that we've heard of this! I have a sworn affidavit from the jurors. You did this! D.A. Winters, that is enough. You did this! You paid them off! Winters! You re not going to get away with this, I know you killed your wife! I m going to make you pay! You re just like my father. D.A. Winters, that is enough! I declare this a mistrial, court is adjourned. The Governor has gone on record stating that Mr. Locke's innocence will be substantiated. Once again, shocking turn of events as three jurors have come forward with a signed affidavit saying that prosecutor Yasmine Winters stacked the jury. Would you turn that off please? The Governor s office has started an independent investigation... You can t beat yourself up over this. What did the doctor s say? I m fine. Look, I had a panic attack, I hyperventilated. I m almost finished filing the new case and the petition should keep the kids in protective custody. Winters... And I have a meeting with Locke s lawyers this afternoon, and... Winters... I m going to need to borrow a couple people from research. Maybe Sue, Rachel and... Winters! You re taking a leave. What? Look, it s already been approved... and it s not negotiable. Go visit your sister. What? Now, really? I should ve seen the signs earlier. My dad practically killed my mother. They said it was a suicide but I know better. It was a mistake! I made a mistake and it s not going to happen again. Yasmine... did you talk to the jurors? How could you ask me that? I have to. No, I didn t. The only thing his little jury stunt did was buy you more time to build a case against him. Hmm? Now go home and don t tell anyone where you re going. Find some time for yourself and Paige... come back and win this case. Copies of the proceedings. Okay. Let s eat. Don t hang up! I m coming, I m coming. Don t hang up! Hello? Hey sis... it's Yasmine. Hey! I know it s last minute but, um, I was thinking about coming to visit you. It'll be like we were kids again! Two Winters sisters, getting in trouble. And Paige? Of course, Paige. But I have to warn you, this isn t exactly the big city. I don t have Wi-Fi. How rustic. It's okay, my phone has a data plan. I'll get everything ready. Thanks sis. Okay... can't wait. I'll see you soon. Okay. I'm excited. Okay, bye! See you guys later. Hey. Hey. Are we leaving? We re going on a holiday. What, are you serious? When? Now. Sweet! No school. Nuh uh, not exactly. You re going to do your courses online, it s all worked out with the principal. Well how long are we going for? Two weeks. Seriously? Homework on a vacation? Oh Paige, you re going to have fun too. And I, uh, packed all your stuff. Wait, did you bring my boots? No, you don t need your boots. No, I want my boots. Come on, let s go home. We re not going home for your boots, Paige! Oh, come on! It's just around the corner... please? No. Mom... Mmhmm? I love you. And that s very nice, Paige. I love you too. So, can we get my boots? No. We re getting my boots, right? No, we re not. Yeah we are. Oh, I hit something, be careful. Okay, fine... only boots. Hello! I just made cookies. Oh my gosh. Hi. You re so big! She looks just like Mom, doesn t she sis? Maybe a little around the eyes. Yeah. More than the eyes. Well let me help you with your luggage. Oh, this is it. Well you two travelled light. Mom s stricter than an airline. Only one carryon allowed and my boots. Well when Laura and I were young, Mom always made sure we were packed and ready to go. Why? Uh... I made cookies! You already said that. Uh huh, chocolate chip. Oh, Peter! Peter! Come here! Come over here. Come here, hi! Hey, hey Laura. This is Peter. He s my very attractive, single neighbour. Oh, he s attractive alright. Paige! Peter, this is my sister Yasmine. Hi. Hi... nice to meet you. This is my daughter, Paige. Hi Paige. The District Attorney... I read about you... heard many good things from Laura. Lies... all lies. Well, maybe one or two lies. How about a chocolate chip cookie? Your favourite. I can't, um, I'm off to the office. It s nice to finally meet you, Yasmine. Nice to meet you too, Peter. Good day, uh... What? You like him. Not in the way you think. I think she s right. His wife passed, two years ago. He s ready to move on. I came here to clear my head and to work, not to date. Okay, okay. Mmhmm. Get up here, look at you! Oh my gosh. You fixed it. I found it in the basement after Dad moved away. You should ve kept it buried. Yeah, it's... Mom, you look so young. It was her eighth birthday. I do look like your mom. Agreeing with Aunt Laura s not going to win you any points. Yes it does! Ah, well it'll also win you going to pick vegetables out of her vegetable garden and maybe making some clothes. Ha ha ha, very funny! Come on, let's go unpack. I got work to do. You re on vacation! Only in spirit. Did she really bring work? Timothy Locke, she s obsessed. I told you to keep the garage door locked. You re hurting me. They were inside of my car. Let go of me! Yasmine, you get over here. I saw the news reports, looks like a very tough case. Did he really kill his wife? Yes, yes he did. The worst part is though he has these two kids... and if I don t get him behind bars, then he s going to have custody of them and I can t have that. I can't... Still fighting the good fight? Yeah, well you too. It s a fair trade. Hmm... Mom, I don't have any bars. Uh, turn on your roaming, I bought a data plan. I m going to get dinner from the garden. Paige, want to help? Two bars, thank you God. It s going to be squash spaghetti. I m talking to a couple of tech junkies. Is that a phone? I think so. Well... aren't you going to answer it? We'll let it go to voicemail. I don t think that thing has voicemail. Hello, Winters residence... Yasmine speaking. Hello? Hello? I think this thing is broken. Hello? Yasmine... Yas, it s your dad. Yasmine, please talk to me. Mom? Mom? Aunt Laura, come quick! Yasmine... Mom... Mom. Yasmine, I just want to talk. It s me, Dad. Yasmine, are you there? You can t ignore me forever! Tell Laura I called. Hi. You fainted. Not so fast. Here... just follow my finger and... I m fine. I m okay, thank you. Mom, you answered the phone and then just collapsed. I m sorry if I scared you, sweetie. Scared me? You terrified me. I m sorry. It was him... on the phone. Why is he calling here? I wanted to tell you... Tell me what? You need to rest, seriously. Doctor s orders. Doctor, who... you re a doctor? Yes, that s what my business card reads as... Doctor Peter Sorensen. Thank you, very much but I, um, I need a couple moments with my sister. Thank you. Okay... hey Paige, um, why don't we go make some hot chocolate in the kitchen? Are you sure you're okay, Mom? Yes sweetie, I m totally fine. You talked to our father? The man who killed our mom. He didn t kill her. Maybe not directly... He deserves another chance. He doesn t deserve another chance, Laura. Are you out of your mind? He called me six months ago and he wanted to talk. What should I have done? Hung up! He s changed, Yasmine. People like that don t change! He asked about you. I don t believe this. I don t believe you. I should never have come back. I saw what he did to you. Yes... and I forgive him. Well I don t! We're leaving... now. Yasmine... listen to me. Don't you feel the hate you carry inside? Coming here is the universe telling you to let go. The thing that happened in the courtroom, Yas... surely you see this. This is the universe telling me my sister is off her rocker! For Paige s sake, you need to face your past, to stay a couple of days. We can talk this through. There s nothing to talk through. There is. When you left... I stayed in this house. Mom's house. Our home. Alone. Just me... and a whole lot of anger. I had to change here to find peace. I had to forgive him. I had to forgive Mom... and I did. It s never too late. You owe it to yourself to at least try. I m sorry Yasmine. I... I didn't mean for you to find out like... It s okay, it s okay. It s okay. Hey, I don't think you should be walking. I m fine. Really, I m fine. Mom, Peter s a psychiatrist. A shrink. Peter Sorensen, doctor of psychiatric medicine at your service. He helped me. He can... he can help you. No, no, no... I'm not here to sell my professional services. I just wanted to make sure you were safe, that s all. Thank you. I should get going, um... see you guys later. Good night. Good night. He helped me... and he can help you. Laura! You're being pushy. Yasmine, you fainted... and that s not normal, okay? PTSD and anxiety are real. It took me almost two years to let go of my pain. It s liberating. Hey! Hey. Are you sure you're feeling okay? Yes, I am. I m much better. Look Paige, I just, um... haven't heard my father's voice in so long and it surprised me. Mom... you know a voice shouldn't make you want to faint. I know it shouldn t, but I m fine. Okay? Okay. I don t know, maybe Aunt Laura s right. Maybe you do have post traumatic stress disorder. Will you stop listening to your Aunt Laura? She s not always right. Hey troopers... I'm leaving at 8:00 A.M. tomorrow and I'd like you both to come along. I want to show you around. Okay, for a couple of hours but I just have to... Perfect! See you bright and early. Well I guess I d better get some sleep. Yeah. Good night. Good night, Mom. Child services has just denied Timothy Locke custody of his two young children pending further review. Mr. Locke! Were you surprised that you didn t get custody? Mr. Locke? I will get my children back and prove my innocence, no matter what D.A. Winters thinks she has on me, because it s false! I did not kill my wife. She should focus on who actually did. No one will stop me from getting my kids back. Chilling words from a man innocent until proven guilty. This is Karl Summers, KPPQ News, Seattle. Hey, it s Yasmine. Did you see the Locke intervie? Pretty sure that constitutes a threat. Technically no, but we did receive death threats at the office this morning. The local police are checking it out. How s Ms. Flores? She's scared... I received a call from the Governor. He wants to review the case personally. I have to give him Ms. Flores testimony. That is not a good idea. You re revealing our smoking gun, you have to stall him. You re putting her life in danger! If I don t, he'll pull the plug. Yasmine? Brown, I m so sorry, I have to go. I'll call you later. Okay. Bye. Are you not ready to go? I'll be five minutes. Hey... when did you start eating vegetables. The ones that Aunt Laura grows just taste better. Okay... five minutes. Hurry up! The building was recently expanded into classrooms for a myriad of reasons. School? Sort of... but mostly to teach basic life skills to people who didn't graduate high school. We host agricultural events... anything to help the community. As a social worker, I have three goals... education, independence and employment. I'm very happy when one of my clients no longer needs my assistance. Um... Paige, honey... do you mind giving us a second? Some of my cases have private matters I need your mom s help with. Yeah. Okay. What? Come with me. Carla... this is my sister, Yasmine. Hey. Hey. Hello. Carla has a few issues that I thought you could help us with? Six months ago, arrested in connection with an armed robbery that her boyfriend James committed at a liquor store. A man was shot by James. Carla was in the car thinking James was inside buying a six pack. Accessory after the fact? I didn t know. He drove away and then when the cops showed up at our apartment, he forced me to lie about his location. Carla... He d hurt me. I didn t know what to do. Don t come out Yas, until I say. Promise me! It was an accident! She s a little kid, accidents happen. Listen, I don t care. Do you know how much that shirt was? Don t you judge me! Jack! Daddy, stop! Did you just tell me to stop? You think you can tell me what to do, just like your mother? Now where s Yas, huh? She is going to clean up this stain. Where is she? Please... leave her alone! Yasmine? Yep, uh... Are you okay? Mmhmm. The public defender can help you with this. I have one, he s no good. Carla, I m the one who puts you in jail, not the one who keeps you out. Yasmine... she's innocent. And if I thought any differently, I wouldn't have brought her to you. She s a good person. The public defender messed up pretty bad, she s going to serve time. I'm sorry, I can't get involved in this. Yeah, I knew she wouldn t help. I can t, Carla. You know I have been trying like really, really hard to get my life back together but all the state wants to do is just shove me inside a jail cell. You said that she'd understand, that she'd seen abuse... but maybe, maybe she s forgot what it feels like to be hurt. I can t believe you ambushed me like that, Laura. I mean, you always do this to me. You always force me into these situations. Okay, maybe I lead you into helping Carla but... she needs a good lawyer and you re the best. Please! She s a good person who was abused. She doesn t deserve this. Fine. I'll look it over. But don t ever do this to me again. I m sorry. I crossed a line. Yes, you did. I'm going to go get a coffee. Hi. Uh, the usual, to go please. Hi. Hi. Well I see you've found the best coffee shop in town. Yeah, it wasn t a coffee shop when I lived here but it s good. May I? Please. You should try the pie. They bake it fresh every day. You know, I m not a pie person. My mom made it all the time growing up. My favourite's cherry but she always made apple 'cause... well, it s complicated. Complicated s okay. You re good. What? I already want to tell you my life story and I've met you, what... twice? You're just really... Yes? Comfortable. Thank you. Are you in a hurry? Yeah, I had a patient of mine go off their medication. I'm heading to the state ward to pay him a visit. Better get going then. I d rather stay here. Well that would be nice. Will you go to dinner with me? Tonight. Uh, there s not a lot of restaurants in town but if you like sushi... Sushi? Sushi is my favourite. I can t believe they have sushi here, that s great. So it s a date. Yes. I'll pick you up at 7:00. You re okay, you re okay. Hey, hey! Breathe deep... deep and slowly, there you go. There you go, breathe deep and slowly. You re okay. I thought I saw... Who? My father. Um... panic attacks... you re having acute panic attacks. Usually brought on by stress or traumatic events. Oh my God, your pants. It s fine, it s okay. No, it s not okay! I can get you another pair. It s okay. I ve got to go to work, I m late. I m really so sorry. Yasmine... it s okay. Thanks. Um... we're still on for tonight? Yeah. I m looking forward to it. Great. Great. Confidence. It s about believing in ourselves and our abilities. And my sister, folks! Yas... I need to talk to you. Right now? I saw him. Who? Jack. Let s take a ten minute break. Dad retired to, uh, Texas. Well if he drives a Wagoneer, he is here, right now. I m pretty sure I saw him. Pretty sure? Well I didn't... you know I didn t get a great look but it was him. Did he look like he was 20 years older? Or did he look like how you remember him? I don t know. He looked like how I remember him. You re projecting, Yas. I m projecting? It s common. I went through it. When did you first see Dad? Um... in the courtroom, he was in the place of Timothy. Your mind is trying to process repressed traumatic memories, it's normally at the root of PTSD. Maybe your case with Timothy triggered it. I learned a lot about this. Oh, from Peter? Yes, he's good... And he helped. You re not crazy. Millions suffer from this. There are ways to deal with this. Like a straight jacket? Like confronting your past. Laura... no. The past is just that, it's the past and that's where it stays. Thank you. Yes, I understand. What s going on? I ought to take you out and bury you myself for bringing all this onto our family. You are pathetic! I ve put things into motion. Besides the maid, is there any other evidence that could, uh, point this murder at you? I... I... I... I... what? I don t know, okay! I don t remember. There s too much going on right now. You figure it out! You figure it out unless you want to rot in prison for the rest of your life. You figure it out and then we'll clean this up. God, you always were a disappointment to me. The only reason I m doing this is for mother and the grandkids. Did you talk to social services about my kids? We re dealing with them but they re not budging. So... you figure out who or... or what else could possibility implicate you in this murder. Could you do that? Hi. Hey. Uh, she s not ready yet. She had a hard day. I know, um... well maybe these will cheer her up. No, but it s still a nice touch. Hey! You look nice. Here, for you. Thank you. I can't remember the last time someone brought me flowers. Oh come on, that can t be true! Actually it is, Mom doesn t go out much. Go put these in some water. Okay. We should go. Yeah? Yeah. Great, okay. Okay. Aye aye aye. Have a good time you two! Thank you. You are welcome. Oh my God. You typically have a hard time with liquids? I don t know, is that a symptom? Of? Of I don t know, Peter. I don't know whether this is a dinner or an attempt at a diagnosis set up by my sister. Simply a dinner of my own accord. I m onto you. Thank you. Um... how's your patient? The mind's a complicated puzzle. I give her medications to regulate imbalances and when I think I get it just right... the mind tricks her into believing she no longer needs the treatment. It's a cycle... that I'm sure you find dull compared to the bright lights of a big city District Attorney. I have my days. You know... Laura talks about you all the time. She probably tells you more than she should. You left here when you were 17, you put yourself through college and then law school, a single mother... You re a fighter. I work hard to get what I want. You always get what you want? I think the trick is wanting what you re just about to get. Hello? Who s there? And, uh... not long after they found the cancer. I m so sorry, that must ve been horrible to go through. Yeah, I felt helpless I wasn't able to save her. I was devastated. It took me a long time to heal. I miss her but you know, um, love is a funny thing. You never know where you're going to find it. Paige is fantastic, you are very lucky. Yes I am, she never complains about anything. She s like you! No, no... she, um, acts like me but she s a lot more like Laura. Which I m happy about because when she s like me, we fight. Carla! Hey. What are you doing here? You re out on bail. Easy, easy... this doesn't include you. What are you doing? This kind of behaviour isn t going to get your daughter back and it's not going to keep you out of prison. What s the point? I may as well have a little fun before I get locked up. Listen, if you want me to help you, you have to stay sober. Cause I ve looked at your case and I think I can help you. Really? You re going to help me? Yes. But you do what I say or I walk. Okay. Okay. Rule number one, get sober and stay that way. Thank you. Okay. Go home and I'll call you in the morning. Seriously man? Okay, party s over. Step off, guys. Time to step off. See ya! What a joke. Wow. Good job. Thanks. You want to go get a cup of coffee? Yeah. Yeah? Did you see how I... Sort of just got in between there. You did, you re like, you re like a super hero, you know? Sort of. Aunt Laura? Was my grandfather really a monster? No. But for a time he was very abusive. He had a temper and he was an alcoholic. Did he kill my grandmother? Not directly. She slipped down the stairs and broke her back. They had her on pain pills. The coroner said it was an accidental death but Yas and I knew it was her, um... way out. But she left you and Mom with him, that s pretty brutal. It wasn t for very long. After the funeral, Dad pretty much abandoned us so we learned to sew up old jeans, grow a decent carrot, make due with very little. We were quite the team until your mom left for college. How can you still talk to him? He knows what he did was wrong. He asks about you. Mom wouldn't want to hear that. He d like to meet you. Mom would freak. Your mom has to let go of her pain. You shouldn t inherit that. She'll never change. She will. We just have to nudge her a little bit. Hmm? They re back! Mmhmm. Well, that was an eventful evening. It was. But you know, despite all the drama I had a really good time. Yeah, me too. I really want to do this again. So do I. Hey! So... how was it? Great, Paige. I'll see you later. Yeah, good night. I'll see you later, bye. So, did you kiss him? Stop it! What? Hello? Someone hit the safe house last night. Ms Flores? Dead. Well, get a warrant! Let s put Locke behind bars, now! Timothy was at the family cabin on Vancouver Island. There s nothing that connects him directly to the hit. Oh, come on! You know he did it. Of course he did it. I m coming back. No! Stay there, it's safer... until I get a handle on what s going on. I'll call you later. I m so excited. This isn t going to be easy. Your drug test isn t a pass. Maybe it s a mistake. You know sometimes, sometimes they make mistakes. There's several... positives. Okay, I didn t do anything since you took my case, so... I believe you! But in order for a jury to see you as innocent, you need to be a beacon of light. They need to see you as the victim. The hospital. What about it? There are records of the abuse at the hospital. The, uh, fractured skull, broken arm, ribs... Carla, why didn't you tell me about this? Because nobody else knows, even the hospital think I m clumsy. Okay. If I'm going to do this you have to stop the lies, okay? Because you are throwing away any chance of being free and any chance of ever having your daughter again. I am sorry! I m sorry and I m trying. Try harder! You need to dump your friends, quit the drugs and grow up! Because this case against you is real, this prison time thing is real, you re going to do real time! Yasmine! That's enough. She needs to know the truth. What she needs is support. You asked me to do this! Well, this is how I m doing it. Can I speak to you in the hallway please? How dare you talk to me like that. Do you ever think for one second that maybe she shouldn't be a mother? Maybe she was right, maybe you ve forgotten what it s like to be scared of your life. The hurt... what we did to cover it up. Laura, that doesn t matter. Child services isn t going to see it that way. But they should! Her daughter is the only person she lives for, it s the one thing that keeps her going. Well this is on you because I don t belong here, okay? I'm used to being on the other side. I m used to putting people like her in jail. You re right, I shouldn t have asked you. I shouldn't have forced you into this, you're right. I m sorry. I just, uh, I need you to tell Natalie that I'm sorry. You know... you weren't always so strong. Don t forget who helped you. Hey. Can I grab a coffee, please? Joan. Child protective services is going to release the kids to Timothy on Friday. Well he s still on the hook for murder... and it sounds like he s still killing. When s the next hearing date? Four weeks. Okay, I want you to call Judge Roberts and get him to fit us in this week. He owes us one. Without the maid, we have no case. The forensics point to murder, we'll just stand on that. We both know that s not strong enough. Look... if I don't get the defense something substantial, they re going to motion that we drop the case. I m coming home. I m coming home, we re going to work on this together. No! Stay there, that's an order. Yas... we think whoever killed Ms. Flores might be looking for you. What would make you think that? We got a call from your landlord, she s been looking for you. Well the service here is crap, Joan. What s going on? Someone broke into your home. Paige, can I see you for a moment out back? Uh, yeah... sure. Paige... this is your grandfather, Jack Winters. You look just like your mother. Paige, he just wants to say hi. I just wanted to meet you, I've heard so much about you from Laura. Please come one over here, it s okay. What are you afraid of? Dad. Just like Yasmine. Dad. I'll call you. Yeah. Yeah, just like old times. Why was he here? I thought you said he was in Texas! God, Mom is going to freak when she finds out. I mean, there s the restraining order... Paige... And we can t say anything, okay? Because I m only 15. Shh, Paige... he just wanted to see his granddaughter. Tell him I m sorry I ran. I will. And did they take anything else? That s it? The locks have been changed. Okay, thank you very much. Bye. Thanks. Is everything okay? Well, my key witness is dead and someone broke into my house. Pissed off the wrong guy. No, he s the right guy he s just not going down without a fight. Can you give me a second? Mmhmm. Hello? Yes! This is Yasmine Winters, I m Carla Chambers lawyer. I want to discuss my client s visitation with her daughter. I m aware the case is unresolved but that's not grounds to withhold her visitation. There are records of the abuse at the hospital. There are records of the abuse at the hospital. Okay, thanks. Bye. I ve got him. I m assuming you re talking about Timothy. Yes! Vancouver Island. Their family has a cabin there and it s in Canada. We wouldn't have gotten the records from the time they visited the hospital because... it s another country. I need to make one more phone call. Do your thing. Yeah, it s me. Okay, I need you to do something for me. I need you to check all the hospitals on Vancouver Island for their medical records and see if anything matches Timothy s wife. Yeah, I know it s another country! Just talk to Joan, I have a hunch here, I need you to do everything you can. Okay. Thanks. What kind of pie they got today? Cherry. Great! I'll go get some pie. Thank you. Your hunch was correct! Locke took his wife for treatment eight times in the last six months. Everything from a cracked rib to a collapsed eye socket. I ve sent over copies. s... I'm the only other oe who has a copy. We keep this between you and I until we have to disclose. I spoke to Judge Roberts... she let me expedite the motion for retrial this afternoon. Great! What about Child Protective Services? Well... with a retrial filed, he's no longer eligible for custody. Thank God. This is the smoking gun we needed. Girl, good job! Brown? Are you there? Dang reception. And... send! That should help Carla s case. Hey. You're quiet. What is it, your vegan diet or you just miss your friends? I m fine. I'm done my... Hold on a second. Wait here. Who is it? It s a reporter. Can you just stay in here? I don t want you being involved. I m on vacation! If you stonewall me, I'll only have his side. And what side is that? Mr. Locke is a loving father who wants to see his children. Who s also been charged with murder. What murder? You have no proof, at least none that we ve seen. Many believe you re on a personal vendetta to keep him from his family because of what happened to you when you were a kid. And what happened to me when I was a kid? Um... off the record... I ve seen all your files. Your father abused your mother. Maybe you were abused as a child as well? Your sister most certainly... How dare you. Get out of here. Did you get the slap? It s our lead story. Mom! Those Krav Maga classes really paid off! We re going home. No, I m helping Laura tomorrow with one of her classes. What class? I'm proofreading some cover letters and resumes. Then we re leaving Sunday. Mom, I really like it here. Paige, I don t! Okay, well you always want things your way. No, that s not it! I'm... I'm the parent, you re the kid. Well sometimes I wonder if that's true. In what some are calling a personal vendetta by District Attorney Yasmine Winters, further charges have been filed against Timothy Locke. Earlier today, I had an encounter with Ms. Winters where she proceeded to slap me. We go to that footage now. We re clear. Thirty seconds. This is Karl. What? What? Yeah, hold on. I ve got to go. We re back. It has just been brought to my attention that District Attorney Joan Brown has been murdered. So far we've heard that it's been a car fire but that s all the information we have at this moment. Please stay with us and we'll keep you up to date on that developing story. This is Karl Weathers, KPPQ News. Mom? Yes? I m sorry. Oh, it s okay. The guy you took to court... did he do this? I think so. He really deserves to be locked up, doesn't he? For a really long time. I'll get that. Wait right here. Oh my God, are you okay? No. My boss is dead. Are you kidding me? Hi Peter. Hi Paige. What did you bring? Um... why don't you check it out? Come in. These are so good. Well, there s plenty more. Um... I'm sorry. Any idea who might ve done this? Well... she was the D.A. for 15 years so, um... she made a lot of enemies. My mom used to make cherry pie. Yas! Save some room for ice cream. Hey Princess! Daddy got you something. A pony! That s right, Mr. Pony! Do you like it? Yeah! Guess what? I got you something else. Do you want to go see it? Yeah!

Obv... as if I don't know that!!!! Okay. I can t wait to see Natalie. I m so nervous. It s okay. I'll be with you the whole time. Okay. I m such a bad mom, I don t really have anything for her.

Hello. Let me guess, all went well? She called me Mommy and she has a new tooth. They're going to release Natalie to Carla later this afternoon. How did you do that? The judge ordered it. You know, until the trial s over she s not a danger to her kid. I m so happy for you! It was Yasmine, she did it. You did it too. Hey Mom, um, can we stay one more week? Why do you want to stay all of the sudden? Well I like it here. Hmm... really. I bet you and Aunt Laura are conspiring to keep me here. Well we think you and Peter might just really like each other.

Oh my gosh, I can t believe it. Hey! Hey! Officer, I have a restraining order against that man right there! You stay away from me! Laura! You lied to me. It was him in the car. Where was he? He was outside. He was parked behind me, it s like he s stalking me. He wants to talk. I can t believe this, I can t believe that you lied to me. Just hear him out. You need to find peace, it s okay. No! No! The only thing I need is to get the hell away from him and you. Paige! Yasmine! Paige, come on. Get your stuff, we re going. We re going right now. He s a different person, Yas. We re going, now! Get your stuff. I'll bring her home when she's done. I don t want her out there with him out there and I don't want her with you. Mom, I m fine, I m helping Carla. Fine. We just, we have to go now. I'll bring her home when she s done. Look... I got Carla her kid back. Our debt is paid. You bring Paige home. We re leaving tonight. Yas... You stay the hell away from me! I was just... I have a restraining order. One call to the cops and you re in jail again. Yasmine... please, let me make up for the things that I ve done. Look, I know that I wasn t good to your mother or you girls. Look, I had a drinking problem and I know it doesn't make any excuses at all but I couldn't control it. But I m clean now, five years. You beat my mother until she couldn t take it anymore. And I have to live with that guilt every day of my life. You should! Leave. Now, or I'll call the cops. Leave! Mom! Paige, I don t want you everywhere near him. I ve already met my grandfather. How? Aunt Laura. Don t blame your sister. I begged her to let me meet Paige. Stay far away from us! Dad! Look, Yas...

Peter, I m so sorry, not right now. We re going back to the city now. What happened? Jack. Alright, maybe I should go talk to her. No. I ve done enough damage for one day. I'll let her cool off, I'll put away my groceries and then I'll stop by. Okay? I'll help. Paige, you go back. Okay, I'll see you later. I thought we had to pack. Now we re all one happy family. Paige, do exactly as he says. And I say sit down. Everything okay? Yeah, I think so. Did you know that I m the father of two young girls who might never see their daddy again because of your mother? You deserve it. Paige, don t talk to him. Yes Paige, don t talk to him! What do you want? The medical reports. I don t know what you re talking about.
