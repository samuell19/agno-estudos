THIS PROGRAM HAS CONTENTS THAT MAY BE OFFENSIVE. The idea of ​​going underground was simple. As simple as death lurking on the surface. The cause of death is also clear and simple. As simple as the urge to survive. As a doctor, I have experienced many tragedies. Many disorders. Many lies. It made us look for a way to survive. - Is it a fighter jet? - Yes. Let's keep the smile on for the kids. That's the least we can do. Look, it's Khalil. Khalil, sweet, come along. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? - I'm here because my mother is here. - Yes, she brought you into the world. Let the stethoscope be, sweetie. - How old is your daughter? - Seven months. - What is her name? - Sandi. - What's your name? - Bushra. Bushra, you'll be okay, sweetie. Doctor Amani, stay with us. Doctor Amani, it's urgent. We need you. Where's Dr. Salim? People come with bad injuries. Be ready. - They hit the center. - Stretcher, stretcher! Hurry up. There are injured children. What have you swallowed? - What happened to her? - She swallowed something. She did not breathe briefly. Is God really watching? Dearest. We never give up. Whatever they do. Hand me bandages. Dr. Salim, when I heard music, I knew you were here. Hej, Samaher. The patient's name is Ziad. Lawyer. Major internal bleeding. - Stand still. - As ordered, sweet Samaher. - Where did the last attack hit? - What attack do you mean? Right now when we were here. They say "good morning" to us. As usual. Get this way. Put her here. Who saw her? A rocket fragment at the bottom of the neck. It must be x-rayed. Bottom of neck. Where? Do I have to see? It's here. Where were you when they bombed? - Where were you? - In the mosque. Let your sister speak. What were you doing? I came with water. Did you bring water? Why? We had nothing. - Do you bring water every day? - Yes. The sweet children. - Is the head of the hospital here? - Yes, I'm the leader. I took my wife here and the doctor prescribed a prescription. But I could not find it in a pharmacy. We only have the medicine inside Al-Ghouta. So where can I get the medicine? Al-Ghouta is under siege. There is no medicine. - Find someone who can help me. - What do you mean? A male leader who can do better. Can hospitals with male managers provide you with the medicine? Yes, women need to stay home. Not working. A woman belongs at home with her husband and the children. You also have a home and children. It is the husband's role to support the family. Allow me to break in. I am a doctor. Has my job been bad under a female leader? - No, but... - Good. Hospitals are not dependent on one person. It's teamwork. Let me tell you one thing. As a doctor here... We found that with Dr. Amani, the administration was running well. We voted twice and she won both times. Should we then ask her to stay home? It makes no sense. - She should not be a leader. - No one should say what I do! Sweet Amani, your mother and I miss you very much. Around you it's like fire from hell. Why are you staying? Even if you mean to do the right thing - - people still do not think you should do your job. Everyone whispers about us. Did you see that video? It happens to women. In war, anything can happen. Women are used as tools of war. Amani, we love you and we fear for you. Your plants are here waiting for you. Come on, come on. Doctor Salim, the wounded and the music is ready. The robe is ready, Dr. Salim. - Do I survive? - Just calm down. You are in a stable state. - It hurts in the chest. - Wait a minute. - Host. - Why are you yelling? I feel your pain. We have no anesthesia, but we have music. Harvest. It is well. It is over. - Who put them here? - They need to be cleaned. - Mahmoud, is it yours? - Do you not have memory loss? Yes, but I saw you. I have eyes in my neck. - Do it. You have a big heart. - I like to clean them. Dearest... - Let me do it. - Put it over there. I can put it there and get another one in here. No, there is no room. Amani should have more space. The manager and the staff. Salim gets the little table. The leader gets the big table. The leader is sitting here and we are sitting here. Hello? And. I can hear you. And... Yes, I can hear you. Good morning. I knew growing up that I was facing a fanatical society - - and a racist and dictatorial regime. I was looking for a way to freedom. That's why I became a pediatrician. I react to the awful reality. My job drains my anger. I think about things. Now being outside Al-Ghouta has become a dream come true. My life at university was like that of other students. I was studying medicine and wanted a specialty as a pediatrician. I had other big dreams. After the general training, I started my thesis. But then the war began and I wanted to help the victims. That is why I chose to become a doctor. I want to find the problems and change things. I know it's going to be very difficult, but it's also more honest. My family's situation is like other people's. We suffer like everyone else and live in the same situation. Is it another one? Do not look so scared. It will be OK. Are you not afraid of being bombed again? Yes, it's me. They will definitely do it again. Not a day goes by without cleaning. - Try to touch. - Show me how heavy it is. It's very heavy. That fragment does not need a rocket to kill a man. No, you can just throw it away. Can you imagine that? Gods... I fell and my arm and nose hurt. Because you were afraid of the bomb? - It should probably work. - We take X-rays. Let's check her left arm. - I'll get it. - Also margarine. I also bring margarine. - Do not forget rice. - I take five kilos. We need more than a pound of margarine. And spices. - Did you use them? - Yes. Wait a minute. Buy Chinese salt. Not Swiss. Do not worry. I'll get you Indian curry, Chinese salt... Come on, sweetie. - Did you get an x-ray? - Yes. I find the paramedics. They take care of her. - Does your leg hurt? - Yes. - Can you walk? - Yes. You get some painkillers. Your nose is apparently broken. - Is anyone from your family here? - Yes, my brothers. - Are your brothers also injured? - Yes. Farah, give her some painkillers. Look here. Look, her nose is broken. - Did you get it all? - Yes, except for Chinese salt. It is not important. The Indian rice and margarine are good. - I boil five kilos. - My staff is 150 people. Is it enough? Boil it all. Then we'll see if we need more. - It requires a larger pot. - Is it not enough? Boil twice. First five kilos and then five more. Come on. Get ready for surgery. Samaher? Should the food have more time? - Doctors... - I want to taste. The rice is tough, but we have no choice. Be patient. - Samaher, I want to eat. - Also bad rice. We can not get any better. At least we have rice. - Bad rice, but I'm hungry. - Stop complaining. Tomorrow I'm cooking. We thought you could fix the rice. Maybe margarine is missing. I added a kilo of margarine. The rice is bad and the pot is small. I asked you many times for a bigger pot! I do not complain. I appreciate it. - It's just poor rice. - Not enough water. - I appreciate it. - I'm cooking in a dangerous place. Shut up! Let me talk. When there's a bomb, I run over to the other side. - It's part of cooking. - It could be worse. - Come on. - Yes. - I know him. - He's repairing... He repairs cell phones and laptops. Give me the thread. Alaa, bring the light over to my side. Put on classical music. More, more, more... - The? - No, go up. The. Listen to the ballet music, and then all is well. Turn it and move it calmly. Stretch it a little. Get it around the other and around the back walls. It seems. Just calm down. With God's will... It is nice. One more here and here. - Is it a fighter jet? - Yes. - It's only in your head. - No, it's real. - Are you scared, Samaher? - Not very much. - If we are bombed, we do not feel it. - Have you lost your memory? Doctor, will Zakwan be okay? - What's Zakwan for you? - My father. He's okay. Do not worry. Is there nothing wrong? I have to tell my mother. Are the fighter jets still flying? When does it stop? They want to burn down Al-Ghouta. I hope they burn in hell. Fighter! Gods... Stay inside. There will be a bombing. Just a moment. Come on, we need light. Come now... The power is back on. Hurry up. Hello? Yes doctor Yes, the hospital was hit on the outside. We're stopped. The hospital is not working. Samaher is afraid of losing his memory again. The floors above us were hit. We're worried about the kids. There are no parents here. - Is that okay? - Yes, do it. Maybe they stop bombing. A Russian fighter jet? Everyone in! Is there anyone in the children? Amer, the kids need to be evacuated to the tunnel. Do it now. - How many patients do you have? - Are the cars ready? They hit the hospital and the surroundings. They also hit the market. Where should people hide? The back of the hospital is broken. Three missiles hit it. May God crush the Russians. Are they bombing now? I do not know what is happening outside. Are they bombing now? Is it still up there? I go out and look. The first missile hit over there. A missile hit here. The regime and the Russians are burning everything to the surface. They're getting closer to our cave. I do not have many options left. 13 killed in eastern Al-Ghouta. And six in the northeast. 19 killed in just one day. 19 dead... They are cursed. It's hard to see those photos, but I have to see what happens. He does not feel safe. They know the next air strike could hit the hospital. It says it was a missile launcher. What happens? Get him into the emergency room. It's not a war damage. It looks like mental health issues. Eastern Ghouta on 21 August 2013. People wounded by chemical weapons. Here's one alive. Faster, faster, faster... A massacre in eastern Ghouta. With chemical weapons. A massacre in eastern Ghouta. Civilians wounded by chemical weapons. A lot of sacrifices. My child! - God, do you see my children? - Chemical attacks in eastern Ghouta. What happened was like a nightmare. Their voices, the children's imagination, their eyes. It stuck in my mind. It's the truth. Because I was there. We need to focus on reinforcement again - - and build protection over the hospital. It is hard. All the points are difficult. They are all impossible. Chemicals are the only weapon that nothing can resist. Alaa, I enjoy talking to you. Maybe because we are similar. - Shall we cover the first floor? - Yes, and the ground floor. We shape it like a mountain. If you cover from here to there - - all it will be protected. The pediatric ward is below us. Cover it here. The laboratory is below us. Fix it. Reinforce over the tunnel. I'm coming back to check. - Look there. - Does not water penetrate? It is important to secure the hospital. We need to reinforce the entrance. - What is it? - Difficulty breathing. - She's only 18 months old. - I know her. It's Zeina. Yes, doctor. The humidity is very high down here. Tomorrow we have been here for 15 days. They took the light. We live in darkness. - It's like living in a grave. - How many meters are there? The reserve building is upstairs, but it was bombed. - Are there people upstairs? - Yes many. - Is it safe here? - Yes, safer than upstairs. The siege up there was horrible. The cave was for the people. A bunker to survive in. To escape the death that is always upon us on the surface. And for me and the girls, that's all we have. Since your childhood, you have never let anyone tell you what to do. Very stubborn. I feel guilty for bringing you into this world. Had you been a boy, it might have been easier. Here is a video. Here we are on a beautiful morning in September 2017. Your mother and I water your plants. See how big it is. It's waiting for you to come home. Let no one go outside. We do not have time for that now. Rockets, rockets. - They're bombing everywhere today. - They want to crush the whole of Al-Ghouta. Is it a Russian fighter jet? The fighter gets closer. I'm afraid the hospital will be bombed. Why are you crying? Are you afraid? You're hypersensitive like me. I cry easily. - What's on your hand? - Henna. May I put it on like you? Your hands are more beautiful than mine. Keep your hands over your ears. I do that when I'm scared. What's your dad's job? He's not here anymore. Where is he? - He died. - How did he die? Did a bomb kill him? - A car bomb. - Is it a long time ago? - Do you love your father? - Yes. Were you upset when he died? He's in a better place now. - Where were you when he died? - We were with my aunt. - Then what happened? - We moved to the tunnel. - Did they tell you that? - Yes. - Did you see him? - No. - Nobody saw him. - No, no one saw him. Not even your mother? Can you braid your hair? Do not loosen it. You must not wash or style your hair, for I made it. What do you want to be when you grow up? Haven't you decided? Do not know what you want to be? Why do we live then? For what? Do you not know? We live so we can become something important. We do not want to be normal. We must be something important. What is the most important thing? Is a doctor important? So if you become a doctor, are you that important? Why? - I can treat and help people. - Yes, it's important. - What about a teacher? - Also important. What would you like? A teacher is better than being a doctor. It is hard. "It fills the pulmonary receptors in the hypothalamus in plasma osmolality - - with detectable response limits that change into osmality." "The quantity is 1 in 100." "ADH disappears with the reduction of plasma osmolality." The time is half past two. Let's go. No, it's ten minutes past two. Yes, but we'll be back before sunset. If now something happens. I do not want to go. It's up to you. We promised the woman that. The situation is not stable. That is nothing. A fighter jet came, bombed and ended. - Is there no fighter jet now? - No, if we see one, we can... I should be here. You have to go, so we're back at half past three. We read the summary. We do not have to read all that. All the vitamins? Okay, we're reading those pages. So there it is and... - Is it a fighter jet? - Yes. How can I go with a fighter out there? If anything happens, we'll go back. The fighter plane turns around and leaves our sector. How are you honey? How are you feeling? Hey. Come here and give me a kiss. The cancer runs in her blood. - When did you find out? - Eight months ago. - Is she registered with the Red Cross? - Yes, when they started registering. They said an outsider should request an evacuation. - Who will? - Red Cross or the Syrian regime. The regime? The damned regime. Come and say hello, sweetie. Get a little closer. Come closer. Let me see him. - What's his name? - Bilal. - How old is he? - Almost 11 months. - Can he sit by himself? - No, he's late developed. Get up, let me see you. Do you give him vitamins? - No. - Nothing? Sometimes they do not get food and sleep without having eaten. - Do they not eat all day? - No. It is clearly malnutrition. Day ham. Do you give them something sweet? Jam or similar? No, only if my mom gives me cookies for them. - Are you mostly alone here? - Yes. Do you have blankets for the winter? We have three blankets. If I offer you a job, do you say yes? I would like to, but men in our society do not allow it. If you need anything, come to the hospital. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Why can a woman not choose and do what she wants? - Does it make men smaller? - Religion is a tool for men. Everything is in the name of religion. They take the parts they like and ignore the ones they do not like. They take what they want from religion. Why do they make us feel inferior? Let them say what they want. I want to change that picture. Women can contribute. I have the qualifications to contribute. ...52 patients still to be evacuated. While the UN awaits approval from the Assad government - - nine of them are dead. With the prospect of delays... I sometimes imagine having a child who is dying. And there is only treatment in Damascus a few minutes away. It is hard. Yesterday I saw two children in the hospital. They laughed out loud. I felt optimistic when I saw them. That day there were many bombs and even cluster bombs. But the wonderful children just laughed out loud. - When can we eat? - When the food is ready. Samaher is like our mother. Our great mother. My impression is that someone asks every day, "What is it with the food?" "What is the food?" I mean it. - I used three kilos of chickpeas. - Do not talk and listen to the music. I used three kilos of chickpeas and two kilos of hummus. We are done. You're getting better now. Is tea for 300 lira enough? Stop fooling around. Give me something sterilized so I can beat you without wounds. Come here and let me fix your taste in music. You listen while you are relaxed and do not judge too soon. Watch his hair fly everywhere. Can you see how he puts the emotions into it? He is phenomenal. Listen carefully. It is beautiful as lilies. There's something nice about it, right? Yes, but for me, food is as beautiful as music. Go away and talk about and think about hummus. Now see how... I'll check it later. Doctor Amani? - Just take it all. - I invite everyone around. - What? - Give me the stretcher. Come on, come on... I'm missing a stretcher and two men. We're done soon, sweetie. Can you see how big the wound is? We need to clean the wound and then sew. If the bleeding does not stop, I find a solution. What's your name? Omar? Do not be afraid. It will be OK. Does your stomach hurt? That's okay, Omar. Alaa, we have to economize with the blood. Hold the tweezers. The injury is close to the eye. I have to change bandages. God bless you. Let's check out the girl. - Fire kilo? - Yes. - He lacks nourishment. - It's like that everywhere. No food. We have nothing to give them. - Can you write something? - There is nothing. Had you come before, it was possible, but there are limitations. What about his sister? They lack nutrition. I can not feed her mother so she can breastfeed them. "Why will you not give us anything? See their eyes." Everyone says they are malnourished and lack medicine. There is no medicine. What can I do? Our stock disappears if we are not careful. Do they take the medicine and distribute it? Yes, parents take it and share it with their siblings. - To the operating room. - Dr. Salim is there. - I do not think the child can do it. - Which child? He is malnourished. - Does he have blood vessels? - He has no muscles. - What happened? - We dont know. He also has crazy bones. - How old is he? - He's a child. Only 13 years. What can we do? Can we help and make a difference here? I wish sometimes I was hungry and could not eat like the kids. - I wish it was like that. - Do not say that. Rather than having food when others do not have. I would rather be hungry without food - - rather than having fun eating when others have nothing. But at least you help those around you. Yes, but how much can I really help them? - We do not have medicine for infections. - Is there an alternative? No, there is no medicine for infections. - How do we treat the child? - We do not have it. It is not available. I consider it carefully before giving a child a prescription. - I do not know why they have children. May God forgive you for those words. I hope we can arrange a better birthday when it's over. - Amani does not know, does he? - No she does not. - Give me the balloon. - There. What shall i write? "Happy Birthday, Amani"? Come on, look over here. Turn off the light. And close the door. Go to the emergency room. They say we were hit. Take her with you. Do not worry. You're safe here. Give me the gloves. Quickly. - It is my birthday today. - Celebrating it gives five years of misfortune. Do not say that. I get sad. How old are you? - I can say... - You look like one at 23. I do not want to lie about my age. I'm just turned 30. Gods... Why are you doing this on my birthday? Is it good like that? I said Dr. Amani can do anything. Do not be afraid. Now we remove it all. Let me put the bandage on, sweetie. I knew it from the smell of popcorn. Happy Birthday! How sweet! I love you! - You surprised me. - We planned it yesterday. I could smell popcorn and knew something was going on. - Happy Birthday. - Thanks. If you do not have cake, you must work two years for free. Five years of siege, but we're happy with our boss's birthday. - You did not celebrate my birthday! - You did not say that. If you can not get what you want, close your eyes and imagine it. - What do you imagine? - Pizza with extra cheese. - Imagine a salad with tomatoes. - Yes, tomatoes. - And it's chocolate. - Yes. Imagine that and eat. The pizza is really good. I do not want injured now. SAMAHER ALAA When the war is over, I will lift my cheeks like that. - I want new teeth. - What else? Just new teeth instead of them. They are not good. - I might dye my eyelashes. - Your eyelashes are beautiful. - No, in the sun they are invisible. - They're beautiful. No, I want to color them or use mascara. I occasionally put on mascara in the evening and remove it in the morning. The mascara stays on until the morning. It's more beautiful, right? I make falafel today. And I'm very excited about that. Dearest. I thought my heart would stop. I get headaches from the intense bombings. Every time they bomb, I feel something. It's like I hear the bombs more violent than they are. We have become hypersensitive. Our bodies respond to small things. My Goodness. It is good. You're a master chef. - Can you taste the starch? - No. It is perfect. As sweet as it can be. I thought that sound was a fighter jet. Hurry, the fighter jet may hit soon. Inside the frames, I will pour milk and rice into bowls. - It's just a motorcycle. - Damn it! You're scared of a motorcycle. Can you stop that noise? I want to hear the fighter. Work or be scared. You can choose. I want to hear when the fighter hits. - Now do not get on my nerves. - Just wait a minute. - Just a little. - Why? - So we can hear the fighter jets. - Okay. - They can bomb the hospital. - Just hold on and move on. What do I do if people are injured? We should consider an evacuation. - I am very nervous. - I'm here. Do not be afraid. I try. I was in my office. I got my team out quickly. I can hear the fighter jet is back. It is close to. Get them down in the tunnel. Come to the pediatric ward. Hurry up! Hurry to the children's ward! Let me take over. I want to see my son. My son is dead. Eyad! Wake up, my son! Will he survive? Tell me! I want to see him! My son! My son! You broke my heart! My son! There is nothing we can do for them. Nothing. What's your name? Maher? Send him to the emergency room. Hi, honey, it's Dad. How are you? - Yes, father? - Do not use the camera. The internet is bad. We're just talking, okay? How are you, Dad? I feel good. When I'm not on, I'm busy or the web is down. I feel good. Do not worry. What about you? Where is your mother? Let me talk to her. - Yes, Salim. How are you? - I'm okay, but... - Why can we not get hold of you? - Busyness or poor connection. Do not think of me. I'm fine. Just take care of the kids and yourself. I call when I can. Take care of yourself. Goodbye My Love. Okay... It seems we are not getting any sleep. They said the army is getting closer. - I do not believe that. - It was in the news. It's scary to think about what's next. I did not want to spread bad energy. I wanted to stay awake. You should not blame yourself all the time. - You have limited energy. - It's not a choice. We can not... We cannot choose whether we assume responsibility. Do you have a choice, Doctor? - Make room! - We do not have enough space! Off the road! Get me serum. She gets suffocated. - Doctor? Doctor? - Where's my mother? There is nothing wrong with you. - Be honest. Am I dying? - No, there's nothing wrong with you. - What's your name? - Where's Mom? That is strange. They die without injury. - Did they use chemical weapons? - I was expecting a chemical attack. - Staff must wear masks. - Can 't you smell chlorine, Doctor? Beware. We are dealing with something unknown. Spit it out! Heck, Bashar. Does all his clothes smell of chlorine? How can I hold back the tears - - when I see humanity crushed in front of me? There is silence over us. Over the random deaths. I did my best to save everyone's lives. Come on. Jump in, guys. Insert the bag. Leave it here. Jump in. - Where should I stand? - You step on the man. We must have room for the wounded. I'm his doctor! Hearing your voice hit your mother and me. You do not know how happy it makes me. My daughter, you did something no one else could do. Think of the children you have saved. And the women you employed so they could help their family. People forget the war at some point, but they never forget you. I am proud of you. Remember that your plants are waiting for you to come home. Everyone just wants to survive. They struggled to get on buses that remove them from their homes. Can you see what we have achieved? No one can imagine the things we have seen. Now I do not want to read or work. I want nothing. Maybe just briefly until I figure out what I want. I am considering going back to my parents. When the regime disappears, I will return. I'm scared to open my eyes. I'm afraid that what I saw will torment me forever. I will never forget the truth I went through. It feels like I forgot. Forgot the important stuff there. I want to open my eyes and see the light far away behind the sea. We tried to survive. We tried to stay in our home. That's all. I wonder if there is room for justice.
