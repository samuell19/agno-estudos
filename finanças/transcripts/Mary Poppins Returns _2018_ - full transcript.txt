Rough seas ahead, I fear! (ELLEN SCREAMING) (WATER SPLASHING) Michael! Jane! What is it, Ellen? The bloody sink's exploded! Oh, dear. Oh, not again! JANE: Annabel! John! We heard, Aunt Jane! I'll ring the plumbers! I'll turn off the water at the mains. JANE: Yes, thank you, darlings. Um, Ellen, fetch us a mop and towels, will you? ELLEN: I told him to get them pipes fixed. Been here since the Romans ruled. What's happening? ANNABEL: Don't go in the kitchen, Georgie. Not without your wellies. Oh, uh, yes. Hello. We've had a burst pipe. WOMAN: (OVER PHONE) Just one moment, please. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Excuse me. Ellen! Can you please get the door? I've got the plumbers here. That was quick work, wasn't it? Here, Georgie. Take them. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. MAN: (OVER PHONE) By the park? (KNOCKING CONTINUES) Yes, I'm coming! Blimey. Ah! Good morning, mum. They don't look much like plumbers to me. I meant on the phone. We are not plumbers, we are lawyers. Lawyers? And here's me hoping you might prove useful. (GOODING STAMMERS) Water's off! And the plumbers are on their way. Well done, everybody. Phew! Such excitement. What are you doing here, Aunt Jane? JANE: We're handing out breakfast at the union hall. I snuck away for a morning hug. Come here, Georgie. (BANGING ON DOOR) Will you stop that banging? Barely eight o'clock on a Sunday morning! What you doing with my mop? Forgive the intrusion, mum. Our current workload prevents us from taking weekends off. GOODING: We would like to have a word with Mr. Banks, if he is available. "Notice of Repossession"? Wait there. Goodness. I'll be cleaning up that mess all morning. Here, let me take that for you. Oh, thank you, sweetheart. Excuse me, sir. The wolves are at the door. What do they want? Well, a good thrashing, if you ask me. Oh, it's like the River Thames in there! Don't worry, Ellen. I'll clean up. Why don't you see to the breakfast? Well, yes, somebody's got to, haven't they? Unless we all wanna starve. Why don't you let Ellen clean up? I'm afraid, lately, that means more work for me. The other day, I found a butcher's sack hanging on the coat rack... and my hat was in the larder. Oh, dear. GEORGIE: Can we go to the park? ANNABEL: No, Georgie. Ah! I need a brush! I look a fright. Michael, don't forget you've got guests at the door. MICHAEL: Oh, right. GEORGIE: Whoa. I'm sorry. We're struggling through a bit of chaos this morning. Please. GOODING: So it seems. Unfortunately, Mr. Banks, our business cannot wait. ELLEN: Excuse me, sir. Today, we were... ELLEN: How exactly am I supposed to make breakfast when there's nothing in the larder... but pickled herrings and marmalade? The groceries. I meant to go yesterday. Very well. Pickled herrings for breakfast and marmalade for lunch. There's a shop across the park, will be open. The three of us can go. Thank you, John. But you said we would go to the park today! We can cut through the park on the way. GEORGIE: But... ANNABEL: Enough, Georgie, come along. I'll take that, Father. Oh, thank you. Uh, please come through. GOODING: Uh... MICHAEL: Now, what is it that I can do for you? I am Hamilton Gooding. This is Mr. Templeton Frye. We are solicitors with the law firm of Gordy, Cordry, Gooding and Frye. (JANE GIGGLES) What? No. Sorry, nothing. "Spruce"? Is that your garden club? No, it's the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Underpaid Citizens of England. A labor organizer. She's a labor organizer. Yes. Yes, but we also run soup kitchens. It's a never-ending job these days, I'm afraid. I'm sure it is, Mrs. Banks. Miss Banks, actually. I'm Michael's sister. My wife passed away this last year. That's awful. Those poor children. Yes. Our deepest condolences. Thank you. Forgive me, what brings the two of you here this morning? I'm going to say my goodbyes. I'm late for work. Mr. Banks, you took out a loan with the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank... last year against the value of your home. You did what? Michael. I had to, Jane. With Kate and the bills piling up, I really had no choice. It's hard enough these days, isn't it? Yes. Well... Shh! It seems you have fallen three months behind in your payments. Oh. (SIGHS) I'm so sorry. Uh, Kate, my wife, used to look after our finances. And I've been a bit off stride. Forgive me. How much is it that I owe you, exactly? Unfortunately, the bank is now demanding that you pay back the entire loan in full. The entire loan? Yes. It's all in the contract. That's more than I make in a year. I couldn't possibly. Oh, dear. You have five days. If you are unable to pay in full by Friday at midnight... I'm afraid we will have to repossess your home... and you will have to vacate the premises. But I work for Fidelity Fiduciary. Not as an accountant, I presume. No, as a teller. I took a part-time position there this past year. You see, I'm really an artist. Yes, be that as it may. But my father, George Banks, was a senior partner there. Father left us shares in the bank. You could use those to pay off the loan. I was saving those for the children. Shares? In the bank? Well, that does change things, doesn't it? Primed and ready, Mr. Binnacle? Ready and charged, sir. Do you have the share certificate? I'm sorry, the what? FRYE: The document... The document proving you own shares in the bank. I suppose it must be somewhere among Father's old papers. Yes, I suppose it must. ADMIRAL BOOM: Three... two... one! Fire! (EXPLODES) Good heavens! (GRUNTS) (WHIMPERS) Are you housing anarchists? JANE: No, that's the Admiral, next door. He fires off a cannon to mark the hour. (GOODING COUGHS) He's over five minutes late. Yes. I'm afraid he's been running a little behind these last few years. As are we, this morning. You've been given notice. We'll see ourselves out. Come along, Mr. Frye. I do hope you find that share certificate. I really do. Good day to you both! You really have chosen the wrong profession, you know. (DOOR CLOSES) Why didn't you tell me you'd taken out a loan? (SIGHS) I didn't want to worry you. Or the children. I kept thinking I would catch up. Kate always managed. (SIGHS) Of all the thick-headed mistakes. I can't lose our home, Jane. She's everywhere, here. Well, then, we're not going to let that happen. But, Michael, you know we neither of us have any money, so we just have to find that share certificate. Do you have any idea where Father might have kept it? I don't know. In the attic, perhaps? Yes. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring you into all of this. Michael! Michael! (SIGHS) This is our family home, and you're about to lose it. So please stop pretending everything's fine. You need... Are we going to lose our home? No. No, no, no. No, no. I... MICHAEL: Aunt Jane was only... (STAMMERS) I was just saying you won't have to worry, because your father owns shares in the bank. But you said we don't have enough money. Well, I can make more money. I am a banker now, aren't I? That's what bankers do. Make money. But you're not a banker. You're a painter. Yes, well, painters don't make money. Not these days. Here, you see. The day has hardly begun, and I have already made you 10 pounds! (CHILDREN GIGGLING) We'd best be going. Yes, yes, let's get your hats on, shall we? One moment, John. Georgie shouldn't have to spend his 10 pounds on the shopping, should he? Here you are. Thank you, Father. Ah! Off to the park, I see. Yes, that's right, Ellen. That's nice. Shall we search the attic, then? Don't you have to go to work? No. Work can wait. Oh, thank you, Jane. Well, why don't I check the attic and you check Father's old wardrobe? Yes. We'll make lunch when we get home, Ellen. Gillie stays here. GEORGIE: Aw! (CHUCKLES) Blimey, what little grown-ups you've become. ANNABEL: Father didn't give us enough, did he? JOHN: Not nearly. ANNABEL: Well, we can ask for day-old bread at half off. That's what Mother used to do. Hello, Willoughby! Hello, Miss Lark! Hello, Georgie. Twins. GEORGIE: Oh! Good boy, Willoughby. Come on, Georgie, we haven't got enough time for this. Aw. Come along. Come on, Wil. (GASPS) The balloon lady! Can we get balloons? No, Georgie! We haven't enough for groceries as it is. Oi! Georgie Banks! Keep off the grass. I don't spend all day caring for it just to see my work get trampled on. Go on, off it! Sorry. What if Father does lose the house? We'll just have to figure out a way to get it back, I suppose. You're right. That's what Mother would do. No. (MUSIC BOX CHIMING) ♪ We haven't spoken in so long, dear ♪ This year has gone by in a blur ♪ Today, seems everything's gone wrong here ♪ I'm looking for the way things were ♪ I know you'd laugh and call me tragic ♪ For everything's in disarray ♪ These rooms were always full of magic ♪ That's vanished... ♪ Since you went away ♪ This house is crowded now with questions ♪ Your John's a walking questionnaire ♪ And I could surely use a few suggestions ♪ On how to brush our daughter's hair ♪ When Georgie needed explanations ♪ You always knew just what to say ♪ And I miss our family conversations ♪ It's silent... ♪ Since you went away ♪ Winter has gone ♪ But not from this room ♪ Snow's left the lane ♪ But the cherry trees forgot to bloom The certificate.

PARK KEEPER: You two! I've told you before, off the grass! But our brother! You heard me! Now! What? (ANNABEL PANTING) (GASPS) (PANTING) (CHUCKLES) (GRUNTING) Whoa! Oh! GEORGIE: (SCREAMING) Help! We're coming, Georgie! GEORGIE: Help! GEORGIE: Help! Hold on! Help me! (SCREAMS) (JACK GRUNTS) As I live and breathe. You need to be more careful when the wind rises, Georgie. You nearly lost your kite. And you two nearly lost your Georgie. He might have got away completely had I not been holding on to the other end of that string. My goodness, Annabel... what have you done to your clothes? You could grow a garden in that much soil. And, John... yes, just as filthy. How do you know our names? Because she's Mary Poppins, of course. May I say, you look lovely, as always. Do you really think so? Nice to see you, Jack. Good to see you too, Mary Poppins. I was just your age when we first met, working for a chimney sweep. How is dear old Bert? Traveling the world, he is. Off to points unknown. Well, now I am off to speak with the father of these children. This family is clearly in desperate need of a nanny. Now, quick march and best foot forward, and I'll thank you not to dawdle. Go on! (ANNABEL SIGHS) Father! Aunt Jane! Come quick! Quickly! What is it, Georgie? Has something happened? I was flying a kite and it got caught on a nanny! Whatever are you talking about? Come! Come, look! Wait, where did you get that kite? I found it in the park. She kept it from blowing away. Mary... Poppins. Oh, close your mouth please, Michael. We are still not a codfish. (GIGGLES) Jane Banks, still rather inclined to giggle, I see. Good heavens, it really is you. You seem hardly to have aged at all. Really! How incredibly rude. One never discusses a woman's age, Michael. I would have hoped I taught you better. I'm sorry, I didn't mean... You came back. I thought we'd never see you again. It is wonderful to see you. Yes, it is, isn't it? ANNABEL: So, you know her, then? Mary Poppins used to be our nanny. What brings you here after all this time? MARY: Same thing that brought me the first time. I've come to look after the Banks children. Us? Oh, yes, you too. ANNABEL: But we don't need a nanny. Mother taught us to look after ourselves. You did just misplace Georgie, I might point out. Only slightly. We got him back. We can do anything a nanny can. GEORGIE: Mary Poppins flew here on a kite. You can't do that, can you? What are you talking about, Georgie? Don't be silly. JANE: Oh, let him believe what he likes. When your father and I were young, we used to imagine... that Mary Poppins could do all sorts of impossible things. PARROT UMBRELLA: Actually... "Actually," what? Actually, I'd like to get back to the matter of my employment. Your umbrella talks! Georgie, please, we're in the midst of a grown-up conversation. ANNABEL: Why don't we go upstairs, Georgie? But it did talk! I promise! I'm afraid Georgie sometimes suffers from an excess of imagination. As I recall, you had the same affliction yourself when you were young. Did I, really? Well, those days are long behind me. Are they, indeed? Hmm. Now, about my employment... Yes, about your employment... the truth is, I simply can't afford... We can settle on terms later, although I will want my old room back. That's if it's not a complete disaster... and I will insist on having every second Tuesday off. No, I'm afraid, I... Of course, Mary Poppins. Good, good. That's all settled. Then I'll stay. Now, if you'll excuse me... the children have turned themselves into dustbins. So the first order of business is to see them properly bathed and dressed. Jane, have you gone completely mad? I can't afford to take on anyone else. Mary Poppins isn't just anyone. Don't you see, Michael? No one's hiring nannies anymore. The poor woman has nowhere to go. Well, neither will we by the end of the week! Oh, don't be so grumpy. You sound just like Father. I do not! Give Mary Poppins a chance. You need help just as much as she does! Very well. She can stay for the time being, I suppose. After all, she did fly all this way on a kite. (BOTH LAUGH) Those things, when we were young, they didn't really... Happen? No. No. Of course not. Ridiculous. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Oh, hello, Mary Poppins. Hello, Ellen. How'd you do that? Do what? And why didn't Father believe you flew here on a kite? Because it's complete nonsense, of course. Grown-ups forget. They always do. MARY: That will be quite enough of that. I should have left you in the umbrella stand. (GASPS) Not with the canes! Oh. (GEORGIE GIGGLES) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) What are you two whispering about? BOTH: Nothing. "Nothing." Such a useful word, isn't it? It can mean anything and everything. ANNABEL: It's just that... You don't require the services of a nanny. Well, we have grown up a good deal in the past year, after all. Yes. Well, we'll have to see what can be done about that. ANNABEL: That was our mother's, be careful. I am always careful. So, you're staying? Yes, I'll stay. Until the door opens. What does that mean? That door's always opening. Oh, not that door, another one. The bathroom door? (CHUCKLES) That's just silly, Georgie. Not the bathroom door? MARY: No. But a bath would prove useful. Come along. Time for a good, clean start. Mother always had us take our baths in the evening. Well, in my experience, Annabel... the perfect time of day to have a bath is when one needs a wash. Georgie, you will go first. We are perfectly capable of drawing our own baths. MARY: How very helpful, John. In that case, you may turn off the tap. But not quite yet, still need to put in the bubbles. But I don't like soap bubbles. Well, then you shall have to try to avoid them at all costs. She's a tough nut, isn't she? (SIGHS) All right then... but we'll have to get this done quickly! Right, we still have to get down to the grocers... and it looks as though it might rain. I know who you should ask. (JOHN SIGHS) Her umbrella can't talk, Georgie. The very idea. How do you know it can't? ANNABEL: Because it can't. The very notion is ridiculous. Exactly right, Annabel. It's nonsense. Foolishness. It makes no sense.

(ECHOING) Georgie! John! What happened? Will they be all right? Well, it is just a bath, after all. But then again, it's not my tub. ANNABEL: Shouldn't you go in after them?

ANNABEL: And then, he fell in the water! Not now, please. But it really happened! Tell him, Mary Poppins! I have no idea what you're all talking about. We swam through a pirate ship! Enough, please! You're right, Father. We're sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't mean to be cross with all of you. I... I've just lost something very important. Yes. And we're going to find it. I'm sure your grandfather just tucked it away somewhere for safekeeping. The bank! Didn't Father have a safety deposit box in the bank? Yes. Yes, he did. Well, let's go. It's closed. We'll go first thing in the morning. But won't we need a key? There's a whole drawer full of keys in Father's old desk upstairs. MICHAEL: Is there? JANE: Yes! My goodness, gracious, glory me. You'd think by now they'd have learned to pick up after themselves. Cleaning is not a spectator sport, I'll remind you. John, Annabel, put all the books back on the bookshelves. Georgie Banks, come back here. Take out this rubbish, would you? Yes, Mary Poppins. There's a good boy. (GRUNTING) Off you go, spit spot. (GRUNTS) (HORN HONKS) MICHAEL: Oh, well. That's that. What about Mr. Dawes, Jr.? Couldn't he give you more time? Yes, I'm sure he could if he were still here... but Dawes' nephew has been running things lately. I don't think he even knows who I am. Thank you. CLERK: Very good, sir. Well, it's high time he found out, don't you think? (STAMMERS) Jane? Jane! (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Jane! Jane! MAN: Banks. MICHAEL: Good morning. Sorry. Jane. We can't just charge into his office. Hello, Miss Penny Farthing, is it? Heavens, did the old secretary finally retire? She always had that big jar of sweets on the desk we'd raid as children. WILKINS: I remember that jar. Those little toffees that stuck your teeth together. Must get you one of those jars, Miss Farthing. PENNY: Of course, sir. This wouldn't happen to be your sister, would it, Mr. Banks? Yes. Yes, Jane Banks. How do you do? Great pleasure to meet you. William Weatherall Wilkins. Do step this way. (DOOR CLOSES) WILKINS: If I had known that George Banks' son had taken a loan with us... I would have handled the paperwork myself. Unfortunately... regarding an extension, there's very little I can do at this point. MICHAEL: I see. Our father did leave us shares in the bank. Oh, well, that is good news! JANE: Yes. Yes, it is. But the trouble is, we can't seem to find the share certificate. You wouldn't happen to have any record of Father's shares, would you? I would think so. (BUZZER BUZZES) Bring in the shareholder's ledger, would you, Miss Farthing? PENNY: Right away, Mr. Wilkins. And what about your uncle, Mr. Dawes, Jr.? He'd know if Father received shares, wouldn't he? I'm afraid dear old Uncle Dawes is getting on in years. Non compos mentis... (DOOR OPENS) Which, sadly, is why I had to take over for him. Ah, thank you, Miss Farthing. Let's see. "Babcock... "Baker..." Hmm. Doesn't seem to be a listing for George Banks here. Don't despair. You still have until that big fellow out there chimes his last on Friday night... to find that certificate. And I'll keep looking here as well. Yes, well, thank you so very much, Mr. Wilkins. It's really been a great pleasure. Thank you. Very kind of you. Thank you, Mr. Wilkins. WILKINS: Not at all. (SIGHS) (DOOR CLOSES) (BUZZER BUZZES) Bring in all of George Banks' old files, would you? PENNY: Of course, Mr. Wilkins. (BEDSPRINGS CREAKING) Georgie, this is a nursery, let me remind you, and not a music hall. Can we have another bath? Oh, pish posh. Now, John, you'd best go downstairs and help Ellen... (CLATTERING) ELLEN: Whoa! ...put away the dishes. Yes, Mary Poppins. Here, I can put those away myself. Very well, then. Now, Georgie Banks... if you were hoping that I will let you take this sadly neglected kite... to the park tomorrow, you'd better start patching it up this instant. Yes, Mary Poppins. Hmm. Oh, let me help you with those. Oh, you're a good lad. You're such a help, you are. I only wish I could help your father save this poor old house. I could sell my broach and necklace, I suppose. Matching set, my old mum gave them to me. You'd do that for us? What? Sell my prized possessions? Oh, no, I didn't mean it like that. Oh, it's all right. I think they're fakes, anyway. No. Plenty in this house worth more than them old trinkets. If you'll excuse me, Ellen. What's got into him? (PANTING) Annabel! I know how to save the house! What do you mean? If you two are going to keep up all of this whispering... I'd like you to practice doing so as loudly as possible. It will still be bad manners, but at least then we'll all be in on the secret. Oh, hello, Jack! Mary Poppins, how are you this fine evening? MARY: I'm settling in quite nicely, thank you. (SOFTLY) I was downstairs with Ellen... JACK: Do you know, when I was a lad... I used to wave up to the boy and girl who lived here. Oh. You mean Michael and Jane. Ah, Miss Jane Banks! I see Mr. Banks about now and again. It's been ages since I've seen her. Well, she lives in a flat on the other side of town now. I'm sure you'll bump into her one of these days. What are you doing? You know we're not supposed to touch that. This is authentic Royal Doulton china, Annabel. Mother always said it was priceless... and I bet it'll be enough to pay off Father's debt. That's a terrible idea, John. You know Mother loved that bowl. But she'd sell it herself to save the house! That was Mother's! Put that back! ANNABEL: No, Georgie, give it to me! GEORGIE: No! Put it back! ANNABEL: Let go, let go! It's a good thing you come along when you did, Mary Poppins. (CHILDREN SHOUTING) (BOWL BREAKS) That didn't sound good, now did it? What are the three of you up to? Give me the missing piece! I don't have it! Well, look for it then! Which of you broke the bowl? Georgie did. I did not! It was Annabel! No, I didn't! If John hadn't taken it... (ALL ARGUING) CLYDE: Actually, it was all three of them. MARY: Mmm. Who said that? Oh, dear. ANNABEL: Look! The picture's changed. MARY: It looks as though they've broken your carriage wheel. SHAMUS: That they have. It's useless now. CLYDE: Useless as a chocolate teapot. The bowl is speaking! SHAMUS: And who do we think is gonna fix that? Aye, there's the riddle. Them what broke it fixes it. That's what I say. What do you think, Mary Poppins? Well, I suppose we have no choice. But how are we going to do that? I know a bit about fixing carriages. But we can't fix the carriage wheel. It isn't possible. Everything is possible. Even the impossible. Now, gather 'round, everyone. Spit, spot! Georgie, don't forget Gillie. Are we ready? Ready. (CHUCKLES) Wow! What just happened? Where are we? (CLINKS) Looks like we're in china, so to speak. Over here, everyone. This wheel won't fix itself. Now, tread lightly, this is fine porcelain, and we don't want to chip the glaze. (CHILDREN EXCLAIMING) GEORGIE: Whee! (CHILDREN GIGGLING) Oh, Georgie, head up and feet beneath you. You too, John. (CHILDREN LAUGHING) Excuse me, driver, would you help us? Well, Mary Poppins, is it yourself? But he's... But you're... That's right, I'm Irish. I'm also part poodle. (BARKS) (CHILDREN LAUGH) How wonderful to see you, Shamus. I'm so sorry about all this. Now, would you help Jack lift the carriage while the children put the wheel back on? With pleasure! She's talking to a dog! Well, of course she can talk. (CHUFFS) (GASPS SOFTLY) MARY: Take your places, everyone. (CLAPS HANDS) Ready? And lift. (CHILDREN GRUNTING) Yes. Let's see now, this should do it. There we are, shipshape. Not a bad job at all. Suppose it'll have to do. And back to the nursery we go. Back already? Can't we stay in this bowl for a while? I want a carriage ride. I wouldn't mind one m'self. Well, I suppose it wouldn't do any harm. Shamus, would you mind? Not in the least. Climb aboard, everybody! CHILDREN: Hooray! SHAMUS: Mind the step, plant yourselves comfy. Now, where would we all like to go on this fine, fine day? The Royal Doulton Music Hall, please. Where? What's that?

You were right, Mary Poppins! A cover is not the book. We thought they were nice, but they were mean! Whatever are you talking about? They tried to take Gillie! No, Gillie is right here, sleeping, as you should be. But it was real! They stole all our things... and the wolf said we were never going to see our home again! That is absurd. But I had a nightmare like that, too. So did I. It seemed awfully real. I don't want to lose our home. You see, Georgie? That's why we wanted Mother's bowl.

Let me help you with that. Thank you. MARY: Good morning, Jane. I see you've bumped into Jack. The children and I are heading into town to get something fixed. Would you like to come with us? Work calls, I'm afraid. We've got a rally today. Oh, that's right. You ought to give Jack one of those flyers. You're Miss Banks, aren't you? Yes. I don't know if you remember me. I used to wave to you when I'd see you up there in that very window. Yes. Jack. Yes, of course, I remember. Call me Jane, please. Of course, I was much younger then. (CHUCKLES) True... but your smile hasn't changed a bit. Well, it's this afternoon, if you can make it. SPRUCE, eh? Good for you, Jane Banks. All us lamplighters know what a fine job you're doing for the workers. Well, we try our best. If you ever need a ladder raised or a lamp lit, consider it done. Thank you, Jack. Thank you.

Oh, Ellen! Oh, no, nothing will come of it. No, she says that ship's sailed. And I say, there are always other ships. MICHAEL: My alarm didn't ring. Oh, dear. Let me help you. (SIGHS) I'm gonna be late. That's all that I need! Well, you're not late yet, are you? Here you are. Off you go. (JANE GIGGLING) Good morning, Michael. Hello, forgive me, I have to run. Watch where you're... Michael! I am so sorry! Oh, it's fine. Um, I'm looking for number 19. BOTH: It's two doors down. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Many thanks. Sincerely. Michael, your briefcase! Blimey, he'd leave his head on the breakfast table if it weren't screwed on. Here, Ellen. I'll take the briefcase. The children and I are heading that way on an errand. We'll stop by the bank afterwards. I'll give you a lift. My rounds are done. Wonderful. All aboard, everyone. Come on. GEORGIE: On the bicycle? But there are five of us. We can't all fit. The weight on those wheels alone. Mary Poppins, how much do you weigh? Never you mind about that. It's all a question of balance. Annabel here. Whoa! And then John. JOHN: Whoa! Oh, sit up straight! You're not flour bags. Georgie at the front. Yay! Mary Poppins, you here. (ALL EXCLAIM) I've got it! Blimey! All right, everybody. Primed and ready, Mr. Binnacle? Ready and charged, sir. Ready, everyone? CHILDREN: Ready! Are you sure this is quite safe? Not in the slightest. Ready. ADMIRAL BOOM: Three! Two! Steady! One! Fire! Go! (CHILDREN EXCLAIMING) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) Now, pull over, right ahead. Thank you, Jack. Right. Off we go, jiggity-jog. Thank you, Georgie. This way, please. Never noticed this alley before. Well, clearly you've never had a Royal Doulton bowl that wanted mending. Straight ahead. Here we are. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) "Topotrepolovsky's all repairs, "large and small fix-it shop." Looks as though it's just a small fix-it shop today. That's just what we want. The bowl only needs a small fix, after all. (GROANS) So now my head is a door knocker. (SIGHS) I suppose my beak might be useful for opening cans. You fuss, fuss, fuss. Don't be so dramatic. Cousin Topsy! TOPSY: Mary Poppins! Oh, for the love of all that is holy... do not come in! Don't be so rude! TOPSY: Please stay away. It is Second Wednesday! (GASPS) Second Wednesday. Oh, dear. I'd forgotten. Still, today or never, that's my motto. Ouch! There we are! Follow me. TOPSY: So, in you come. You do not listen to Topsy. (MARY STAMMERS) (RUMBLING) TOPSY: Oh, no! It has begun! (TOPSY EXCLAIMING) (SIGHS) (CHILDREN GASP) Now, what do you want? You have guests, cousin. You might at least greet them at the door. And how am I to do that, please, when I am down here, up on the ceiling? (SIGHS) Very well, we'll come to you. Excuse me, please, Georgie. Now, this way. Be careful on the way up. TOPSY: Why be careful? Leave it all for Topsy to fix. Climb on my shelves. Step on the toys. (CLATTERING) Kick the little china dolls in their faces. John, Annabel, Georgie and Jack... this is my cousin. Second cousin, many times removed. MARY: Tatiana Antanasia Cositori Topotrepolovsky. Oh, but you may call me Topsy. (CHUCKLES) That's an unusual accent you've got there. Where are you from? Oh, that's very interesting story... We have no idea. We need you to fix this bowl, dear. No, no, no. It is as I have told to you... second Wednesday of the month... when everything is turning turtle. (SIGHS) ANNABEL: "Turning turtle"? What exactly does that mean? It means my whole world goes flippity-flop like a turtle on his back. And I don't know my up from my down, my east from my west. My topsy from my bottomsy. (CHILDREN GIGGLE) Yes, I think we've all grasped the concept. Good. That's quick for you. You see, my littles, anything I try to fix... on Second Wednesday goes kerflooey. Kerflooey. Kerflooey!

But that doesn't make it any less beautiful. Our mother always said it was priceless. Well, I'm sure it was to her. Mary Poppins is right, for once. It is all in the way that you look at things. Thank you, cousin. Now, come along, children. Get your hats. And don't you worry about Mother's bowl. I will fix and make perfect for you. So you come back, maybe, next Second Wednesday? MARY: Yes.

MARY: Off to the rally, are you, Jane? Yes. All still here, thank goodness. Nobody fell off. (CHILDREN CHUCKLE) Say, I could come back and give you a hand with all that once I drop the others at the bank. Oh, no, please don't worry. I'm perfectly fine. Really. Oh, nonsense. The bank's just around the corner... and the children and I have plenty of legs to get us there. Now, climb off, everyone. Ready, and jump. Steady the bicycle for me, would you, children? You're sure you don't mind, Jack? 'Course not. I was hoping to drop by that rally of yours, anyway. You were? Oh, good. You can ride in the front basket. Really?

(HORNS HONKING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) JOHN: There must be someone at this bank who could help us save our house. I'm sure Father's already asked. Well, we haven't. Maybe we could get them to see things from a new point of view. Sit over there, please, children. Good afternoon. I'd like to see Mr. Michael... I'll need a signature for those, sir. Of course. Excuse me a moment. Well! FRYE: We mustn't be late for Mr. Wilkins. (GOODING SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) What did you do that for? You hurt his feelings. You do know who those men are, don't you, Georgie? Yes. They're the lawyers. He's the nice one. Maybe we could convince him to help us. JOHN: Worth a try. Today or never, that's my motto. (WHISPERS) Come on! Now, how can I help you? Finally. I'd like to see Mr. Michael Banks, please. WOMAN: (OVER PHONE) Hello. Operator. FRYE: May we go in? PENNY: He's expecting you. Is there something I can do for you, children? May I have a sweet, please? Yes, of course you can, dear. (CHUCKLES) You all can. FRYE: Is in foreclosure. GOODING: Mr. Michael Banks, 17 Cherry Tree Lane. FRYE: In foreclosure. How many repossessions, so far, this month? 19, sir. And we have nearly that amount scheduled for next week alone. Who'd have thought this slump would be so good for business, eh? I wonder, Mr. Wilkins, if, perhaps... as Michael Banks is an employee, you might consider giving him a few more weeks. And lose our chance to get that house? I mean... (STAMMERS) I don't like to lose, Mr. Frye. (BUZZER BUZZING) WILKINS: Didn't I ask for more tea, Miss Farthing? Yes, sir. Right away, Mr. Wilkins. Why don't you all help yourselves? Come on. "Office of the Bank Chairman." We can't go in there. WILKINS: I'm running a business, not a charity. FRYE: It's just that, well... his family has suffered tremendous hardship this past year... WILKINS: You are not giving Banks one more second... to pay off that loan. Do I make myself clear? Look. Shh! GEORGIE: It's the wolf. WILKINS: In two days, Banks will be out on that street and the house... will be ours. JOHN: Georgie, no! You can't steal our house. I'm telling my father! Steal your...? Who are you? These are the Banks children. WILKINS: Are they? Come here, boy, I think you might have... Let's go, Georgie! ANNABEL: Run! Close that door, Miss Farthing! (WHEEZING) Fool! Stop them. MARY: Oh, there you are, Michael. The children and I brought you your briefcase. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Where are the children? CHILDREN: Father! Father! Father! Help! FRYE: Wait! MICHAEL: What is it? What's happened? He's the wolf trying to steal our house! What on earth are you talking about? WILKINS: I'm afraid your children burst into my office just now, Banks. What? I was just seeing if anything could be done about extending your loan... when they came in claiming I was trying to steal your house. He is! We heard him! Mr. Wilkins is trying to help us! But then, why was he chasing us? I just thought they might stop running around and making a scene if I offered them some sweets. I'm so sorry, Mr. Wilkins. See it doesn't happen again. After all, you don't want your father... losing his position on account of you, do you? Hmm? I know time is running short, Banks... but I want you to have every chance of paying off that loan. So, I will make sure that I'm in my office on Friday evening... until the last stroke of midnight. You have my word. Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. WILKINS: Gentlemen? But, Father, he really did do it. Not another word! Take them home this instant! MARY: Yes, sir. We'll discuss this when I get back! Come along, children. JOHN: Now we've done it, haven't we? I don't think I've ever seen Father that upset with us before. GEORGIE: But we were telling the truth! ANNABEL: That doesn't matter, Georgie. We got him into trouble. And he doesn't even know that we broke Mother's bowl. Everything we've tried to fix, we've only made it worse. Which way do we go, Mary Poppins? MARY: Now, why would you ask me? The three of you are leading the way, after all. ANNABEL: Us? JOHN: But we were... Walking around in a fog. No, we weren't. I mean, we are in a fog, but... We were only talking. Yes, too focused on where you've been to pay attention to where you're going. But Father told us to go straight home! He'll be furious if we're late. Not much to be done about that now, is there? Are we lost, then? JACK: That would depend on where you want to go. CHILDREN: Jack! At your service. Say, what's with all the glum faces? Lost sixpence and found a penny? We've made a mess of everything. Father's furious with us. And we can't find our way home. Lost? Are you, Mary Poppins? Hopelessly.

CHILDREN: ♪ Trip a little light fantastic! ♪ Trip a little light fantastic! ♪ Trip a little light fantastic! ♪ Where on earth have you all been? I told you to bring them straight home. I've been worried sick! We're sorry we're late, Father. It wasn't Mary Poppins' fault. We got lost in the fog. Jack and the leeries led us down the frog and toad. He means road. So you've been off filling the children's heads with stuff and nonsense. I've heard quite enough. Come in at once! Best to take my leave. Good night, Mary Poppins. Good night, Jack. Into the parlor, go on. Go on. Don't be too hard on 'em, sir. They're only children, after all. I know they're children, my children, and I will deal with them as I see fit. Now leave us to it. Yes, sir. Not you, Mary Poppins. In here. Very well, sir. You could have lost me my job. Do you understand that? Have you any idea how difficult it is to find a good position like mine these days? But there you all were, tearing about like a... And you, Mary Poppins, I thought you were here to look after these children. It wasn't her doing, it was me. No, it was us. We thought maybe if we talked to Mr. Frye... he could give you more time to save the house. We were only trying to help. Well, you didn't help! Now... I know it's been a hard year for our family... and I've done all I can... to keep you all from worrying, but I can't do this on my own. It's too hard. I just... I'm barely holding it together as it is. I can't even seem to remember my briefcase in the morning... and there's no more time, we're about to lose our home... and I can't lose this house. I just can't. I don't know what to do. (VOICE BREAKS) I'm sorry, I don't know what to do. Everything's fallen to pieces since your mother... (CRYING) Haven't we lost enough already? We haven't lost Mother. Not really. ♪ Nothing's gone forever, only out of place ♪ So when we need her touch and loving gaze ♪ "Gone but not forgotten" is the perfect phrase ♪ Smiling from a star that she makes glow ♪ Trust she's always there ♪ Watching as we grow ♪ Find her in the place ♪ Where the lost things go ♪ When did you all get so clever? Last night, Mary Poppins told us... I hope I'm as clever as you when I grow up. (CHUCKLES) You're right. Of course, you're right, Georgie. Your mother's not gone. She's in your smile. (CHUCKLING) And in your walk, John... and Annabel's eyes. And she'll always be with us wherever we go. Love you. Now, run along, wash your hands, get ready for dinner. Did you have something to do with them trying to save the house? I never said a word. It was all the children's idea. The whole time I've been looking after them, they've been looking after me. I had it all backward. A Banks family trait. What was I thinking? Some people think a great deal too much. Of that I'm certain. (SIGHS) (LEAVES RUSTLING) Here, Jane. Let me help you with that. Oh, thank you. No luck? We can look through everything again if you like. No. No, there's no point. It's nearly midnight. We tried our best, but thank you, Jack, so much... and thanks to all your friends for helping us. Thank you. JACK: Of course. Anything for you. (CHUCKLES) We'll be out in a moment. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) MARY: The children have packed up the last of their things themselves. MICHAEL: Well done, everyone. All right, have you got Gillie? Yes, Father. Good, good. ELLEN: Good riddance to that old kitchen. Never could figure out that stove. (MICHAEL CHUCKLES) All right, well... we've spent every last moment that we can here. It's time to say goodbye. Goodbye, old friend! ALL: Goodbye, old friend! ANNABEL: Thank you. ELLEN: Thank you. ANNABEL: Hello, Willoughby. JOHN: Miss Lark. Admiral. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) What are you all doing here so late? We've been waitin' to see you off, sir. We'd be here no matter what the hour. MISS LARK: If you or your family should ever need a place to stay... Willoughby and I would be happy for the company. That's very kind of you, Miss Lark. Jane's offered to put us up in her flat... at least for the time being. No, forever, for as long as you'd like. I wish you'd come with us, Ellen. Oh, don't you worry about me. I got a nice room fixed up at my sister's. You won't leave us, will you, Mary Poppins? Oh, don't be silly. She says she's not leaving until the door opens. In any case, your home is with us. I'm pleased she got caught on your string, Georgie. My kite! I forgot my kite! Very well, but be quick about it. The Admiral's got something he would like to give you, Mr. Banks, sir. The H.M.S. Glad Tidings, I commanded her myself. May she guide you safely into port. Thank you very much, Admiral. I will take very good care of her. Eight bells, Mr. Binnacle, time to man our posts! Yes, sir. Goodbye, Mr. Banks, sir. JANE: Bye. Bye. MICHAEL: Goodbye, Binnacle. GEORGIE: I found it! ANNABEL: Bye, Miss Lark. JOHN: Bye, Willoughby. Oh, I'm not sure that's gonna get off the ground anymore. It looks more glue than kite. Georgie... did you patch this up with one of my old drawings? It looks like you've done a fine job, there. Look. Can you see? That's all of us together... in front of the, uh... What is it, Father? Wait. "Certificate of shares"! This is it. This is what we've been looking for! ANNABEL AND JANE: Yes! Yes! MICHAEL: We need to get to the bank! What's the time? Anyone? Um, seven minutes to midnight. Seven minutes? It's not enough time. We need to be at the bank by midnight. Take the van. No, it's no good. You still wouldn't make it in time. Well, what can we do? Oh... Nothing. We can't turn back time. ANNABEL: Why not? Everything is possible. Even the impossible. JOHN: Can we do that, Mary Poppins? Can we turn back time? Well, I don't see why that couldn't be arranged. (CHILDREN GASP AND LAUGH) But that's ridiculous. Indeed it is, Michael. It's nonsense. Foolishness! It makes no sense! And if it makes no sense... CHILDREN: It can't be true! What are you all talking about? Never you mind about that. You just get that kite to the bank... as fast as possible, and leave the rest to us. MICHAEL: How will you... ALL: Go! Now, we'll need a lot of help, Jack. JACK: Good as done! Go and gather the leeries! ANGUS: Right. Children, help me ready the bicycle. I'll take the reins this time. Speed is of the essence. JOHN: Have you ever ridden a bicycle like this before? Oh, please. How different can it be from riding an elephant? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Ready, and up! (ALL GRUNT) Now, all we have to do is turn back time. (CHILDREN EXCLAIMING) GEORGIE: This is fun! A very good week's work, gentlemen. Thank you, sir. It look as if Banks won't be joining us tonight. He does have a few more minutes, sir. You said you'd wait until the last stroke of midnight. Yes, I know that! So we wait. I'm a man of my word. How much time do we have? Um, there's only five minutes left, I think. Good. Now over to the tower, boys! Sorry, this is as far as you go. Back in a flash. (JACK PANTS) Come on! LEERIE: Come on, lads! (JACK GRUNTING) Ladder! Jack! (GRUNTING) JACK: Ladder! LEERIE 1: Ladder! LEERIE 2: Ladder! LEERIE 3: Ladder! (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS AND GASPS) No, I can't watch! (GRUNTING) I mean, you would think they'd never done this before. What are we gonna do? I've got an idea! Come on! (BREATHING HEAVILY) Now! (GRUNTS) CHILDREN: Yay! (GRUNTING) Jack! You can turn the time back now! How? I can't reach the hands! Oh, honestly. They better hurry. We have less than a minute to go. ANGUS: We're too late, Jack! JACK: There's got to be a way! Look! (LEERIES CHEERING) (LAUGHS) WILKINS: And three, two, one... Why hasn't Big Ben chimed? Perhaps your watch is running fast. Don't be a simpleton, my watch never runs fast. Big Ben's gone dark. Relight the clock, Jack, quickly. Look. They've relit Big Ben. WILKINS: But that time is wrong. The clock must have stopped. (TIRES SCREECH) WILKINS: That's Banks. He's made it in time! Not yet he hasn't. Get down there and make sure... he doesn't get inside until that blasted clock strikes 12. But, sir... Now, Mr. Frye! (BOTH PANTING) (GRUNTS) Lock it, Mr. Frye! MICHAEL: Hello! JANE: Hello! Let us in, please! MICHAEL: Please, let us in! JANE: Hello? Hello? Jane. What? Let's... Let's go fly a kite. There it is! It's the one with the light. The first one? Okay. You run. I'll unspool. JANE: Yes, quickly! Come on! MICHAEL: Come on! JANE: (SHOUTING) Hello! It won't work. He's never gonna see it. (WIND HOWLING) (JANE GASPS) (BOTH LAUGH) MICHAEL: Let's get in. JANE: Yes, let's go! (KNOCKING ON DOOR) JANE: Let us in, please! MICHAEL: Please let us in! We need to get inside! (FRYE GRUNTS) Oh! Oh, thank you! Thank you! Hurry, Mr. Banks! What? (DOOR OPENS) What is all this? It's what we've been looking for. ADMIRAL BOOM: Three, two, one... fire! (BIG BEN CHIMING) Mr. Binnacle... Big Ben has finally got it right. (BIG BEN TOLLING) MICHAEL: And this goes... at the top. Uh... What's that? Where did this go? Uh... GEORGIE: Right there? MICHAEL: No. GEORGIE: No, there. This piece goes there. And does it matter that it's all cut up in bits? It's still worth something, is it? It's still valid, so long as all the pieces are there. Is that so? Now, Georgie, there was one more piece, a corner piece... with a lot of signatures on it. Do you remember that? I must have thrown it out. I'm sorry, Father. MICHAEL: Oh, that's all right, Georgie. No, it isn't. I'm afraid you have a problem, Banks. You see, without those signatures, you have no bank shares... no house... you have nothing. What? But he knows you have the bank shares! He's been planning this all along! Take your children out of here, Banks. I've had enough of their lies. Don't you dare insult my children. Don't you dare. (PAPER RUSTLING) They are not lying, and you know it! I only wish I'd believed them sooner! You all had him pegged right from the start, didn't you? Come on. Take the house! Go ahead. I have everything I need right here. (DOOR OPENS) He has you there, Willie. Uncle Dawes? What on earth are you doing here? A little bird told me... that you've been trying to cheat the Banks family... out of their shares in this bank. That he has. We heard him. MR. DAWES, JR.: I also hear... you've been telling the whole of London that I've gone loony. The only loony thing I ever did was trust you to look after this bank! You can't be serious, I've nearly doubled the profits of this bank. Yes, by wringing it out of the customers' pockets. Their trust in us built this bank. You've squandered every last bit of their goodwill. Well, Willie... I'm back, and you're out. Gentlemen, would you show my nephew to the door, please? FRYE: Yes, sir, Mr. Dawes. Get off! You're not fit to run this bank! Oh, we'll see about that!

By the way, those shares of yours... perfectly fine... save 'em for your family. I'm sorry, I don't understand. I'd like to tell you a little story. Once upon a time... there was a man with a wooden leg... (MUMBLING) That's not it. (ALL CHUCKLE) It's about a little boy named Michael. Michael wanted to give his tuppence to a bird lady... but after a little persuasion, hmm? He decided he'd give 'em to his father. Michael's father, your grandfather... gave those tuppence to this bank... and told us to guard it well. We did just that. And after several quite clever investments... if I do say so myself... that tuppence has grown into quite a tidy sum. Really? Really, Michael. In fact, enough to pay off that loan you took. The house is yours. (CHILDREN GASP) Oh! (ALL LAUGHING) MICHAEL: What a beautiful day to be going back home. Look at them lovely cherry blossoms. They're lovely. I shall have to paint them. (JANE CHUCKLES) What about you, Jane? What about me? He means what about you and that handsome lamplighter, Jack? (ALL CHUCKLING) No! No, we're just friends. Oh, go on. Really. Stop it, Ellen! (ALL LAUGH) What's this? The Spring Fair, it's today! Can we go? Please? I don't see why not. CHILDREN: Hooray! ANNABEL: Come on, Father, let's go! JOHN: Will you go on the Ferris wheel with us? MICHAEL: Yes. And you too, Jane! JANE: Only if you come with me, Ellen. ELLEN: What? Wouldn't be caught dead on that thing.
