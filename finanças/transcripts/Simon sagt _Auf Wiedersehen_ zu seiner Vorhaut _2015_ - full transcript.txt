Every third male worldwide is circumcised. That's obviously just the average. In some countries that ratio is different. There are different theories for why people started it. Some say prehistoric man replaced human sacrifices with circumcisions. Other researchers claim it clarified clanship during Stone Age. The oldest account stems from ancient Egypt. Inspiration was the snake, which was worshipped for its ability to shed skin. In Judaism circumcision plays a very important part. 'He who does not circumcise his son by the thirteen's birthday has broken his covenant' The bar mitzvah takes place with thirteen years. You become a man and should be circumcised. But usually you don't wait that long. Male offspring is circumcised after the eighth day of birth. The whole thing evokes the covenant between god and Abraham. Do you see that? Yes First he pulls it like chewing gum. And then, ZACK! With that he peels off the foreskin. And what happens with it? With what? With the foreskin after the circumcision. It goes to hospitals. Burn victims get it sewn onto their faces. Seriously? Yes. Or after a dog bite. Do not believe every crap. You bury it! 10th tishri. 6th September. The day everything began. My dad gave me telling glances. Somehow I had a bad feeling. Are you alright now? The wann (warm) chicken soup is very good. That's not chicken soup. I don't want to say anything but a celebration without a rabbi is like a woman without children. We already have a candidate for the rabbinate. And I don't think she has any children. No she doesn't. Well our board demonstrated its ineptitude once again. Thank you very much! So Simon, how is the preparation for your bar mitzvah going? Normmal I Think. Simon can't wait to be considered a real man. A parishioner. Right? Just like you. Vocally It was again brilliant today Wonderful. How is your wife doing? Overcome the crisis? She moved out. She is writing a book. She needs time for herself. Oh really! About what? It's about love. Or something like that. All in all it was a great event, do you think? Could you pass me the scoop? No Simon. We are cooking milky. Thank you. 'You shouldn't cook the kid...' - '...the kid in it's mother's milk' the torah says. I know. It's important not to mix it up. My dad wanted to uphold every rule of Judaism without exception. There are 248 commandments and 365 prohibitions. These three may go into the fridge. 27 rules alone, concern food preparation. Actually my granddad was the only one following the commandments. He visited the synagogue everyday till he couldn't find the way anymore. My father started taking him. Eventually he moved in. Every morning granddad would promise me that we would go to Israel together. Then he flew alone. In a coffin. Dad said it was only his body. Nothing could get my dad from death watch and sit shiva for seven days. That marked the beginning of dads steep religious career. It will get better. You will see. Good morning Mrs Grunberg. Hallo Ben. Hello. Everything alright? Yes. Bye. So did you get back the german exam? Yes. Hello you two. Frank? To day is Thursday. Yes. On Thursdays we go for lunch... for lunch yes. I reserved a table for three. To be honest I don't know if it's a good idea. Come on. Wait! Stop! Not together. No exception. We reserved for 'Muller'. That should be our table over there. That's not your real name Mr Grunberg. I have to ask you to leave my venue. I can't do this again. You look great. I went hiking for two days. By yourself? No. With Lutz. Lutz and Andrea. Always ready to put on their hiking boots. Andrea wasn't with us. She and Lutz separated a few months back. And you two? How was your weekend? We went to the parish for a circumcision ceremony Clemens passed out. But he already feels better. You went to a circumcision with Clemens? Do you know what you are going to order? Was that your idea? What do you mean? Did you drag the boys with you? 'Drag' is the wrong word. How about the kosher family plate? You want to promote this barbarity to Simon? The plate is almost exclusively vegetarian. You know exactly what I'm talking about. It's because of my - Your dad wants to get you. He's celebrating his bar mitzvah in 28 days. And before you become a man, religious I mean, we have to make up for what we omitted. It's nothing more than a little cut, medically speaking. Don't worry. Nothing will happen to you. After your birth we omitted the circumcision because of differences in the family. I don't know what's worse. That you want to bring him to the mohel... I wanted to - Or that you had the chutzpah to keep it from me. Could we all take a deep breath? The foreskin has 16.000 highly sensitive nerve endings. No. The penis of my son won't be mutilated. I only caught a few scraps of talk but maybe it would be better if I Thanks. We're going to order the family plate. I'll do it. I'll move to the country. How about you stop renouncing your religion. You are Jewish like us and - I won't allow neurological castration. Two million men live happily without their foreskin. Well they don't have a choice. It's the law, Hannah. Not my law. I can decide for myself. It's my penis. Hi. Everything kosher? Stop that. So did they tell you how long after the operation nothing works? What do you mean? What do you think? That you can crank him right after it? Forget it. How was it for you? Well I was only eight days old. You don't feel anything because of the nervous system. At that age the pain doesn't even get to the Hypo Hypo - what? When you do it later it's really painful. You're dripping. So enough talk. Over there. The Blonde. Clemens. Ready? Don't forget Ole Knutsen: 'Detours are the paths to cowardice.' Always try touching it whenever possible. Come on. You can do it. Ben was one and a half years older than Clemens and I. He must have seen something in us. Talent. He taught us a lot. And that's why it's very important not to waste anytime. Ole Knutsen Ole. - He is the greatest. In the 70s Ole Knutsen developed, as a big-game hunter, the 'magic rule of three': Stalk, Distract, Haul off. *Stalk. *Distract. *Haul off. That's exactly what happens if you break the 'magic rule of three'. Shalom. We haven't met yet. I'm Rebecca Tannenbaum, the new rabbi. Please stand up. And who are you? I am Levi. And what do you do after class? I continue studying the torah at home. Is that true? And what's your name? Rebecca. That's Simon. For everything in life there is a replacement. Not for my first love though. That's what the wise men in the Talmud say So what did you talk about with my predecessor? Tacking. What? Turning manoeuvres at sea. That's what rabbi Moishe taught us. He then never returned from his surf holiday in Israel. Reportedly he fell in love. I once had 18 stings in one day. I confused everything just like you. We have beehives at home. If you want I can show them to you. Good choice, good choice. A little older, new to the neighbourhood, experienced. A lot of things right. What are you talking about? You eyed the rabbi like an animal. Believe me she likes you,too. Why do you think that? Body language. it's like reading ones mind. It's impossible to hide. You're gonna get her. It won't be easy but I have a few ideas. I'd rather not. Yes, yes. You got a camera? Listen Ben, I'm not interested in your ideas, 0k? Simon. Hello. 0h, you're here again as well. Hello Mrs Grunberg. Is that... Have you finished 'Sweet Juices'? Congratulations Mrs Grunberg. Not a lot of copies. But yeah. For whom of the three winemakers does Fabienne go for at the end? Ben, I'm happy about your interest. But I think we shouldn't be talking about that kind of literature anymore. You don't mind if I take a peak, do you? Don't worry, I'll be careful. No problem, right? Alright. I'll go into the room so you guys can talk. I know you prefer to pick your own stuff, but I thought you might like this. Oh cool. Cool. Thank you. You're welcome. I know it's not that easy right now, but you're being brave. I'd like to take a trip with you. There are a few people whose story you should hear. Dad says you only need some time before you come back. Probably not, right? I want to be truthful with you. I don't know. Can't you be friends? We'll see. Ben? Did you just... Your mother is a great artist. I admit, maybe it was too much with the song. I've written a poem this time. May I read it? It's called 'Ode to the missing foreskin'. That's great, Henning. Maybe at the end of the session. We have a guest today Welcome Simon to a session for victims of genital mutilation. Hello Simon. Hello Simon. Simon seeks counsel. His dad is urging him to get circumcised. Raphael hasn't been reprocessing for long. It's common to get spontaneous emotional outbursts. I am sorry I think I have to go into the 'hull'. So here we have the uncircumcised or complete human penis. A tube-shaped organ. In its flaccid state it's between four and twelve centimetres long. If it's less than four centimetres that's alright too. The corpus penis, the penis shaft. Here the glans. The prepuce penis, the foreskin. Laid out it's the size of a post card. Highly sensitive. Can register temperature changes of 0.2 degrees Celsius. Can I read it out now please? How much joy would be allotted, could I slide you up and down, it was once sweet and gentle, when is it going to be similar. Simon, could you come here? His, his frizziness, his noble garment I want to go home. I'd like to tell you a few things about the dangers and consequences. Oh, he doesn't have to see that. It's better to see it here than on himself. It's okay. How can something like this happen? Malpractice, inflammation, various reasons. Come on let's go now. Where are you, you tender, lovely foreskin. I'm telling you there were things - Tell us. Well sometimes you couldn't tell what it was. One looked like these pigeons that lie on the street and are run over again and again. Rad. And your mother was there the whole time? Terrific woman. I've always said that. And what did your father say? He's advertising as well. Just differently This is a sign of our bond. Signs are important. They express who we are. Where we come from. Abraham was 99 years old. After a sign of god he began. He circumcised every man of his home. The sign of his bond with god saved his family it's about us belonging together. And why don't you admit it? That you're divorcing, mom and you? Because it would be a lie. To the Mormon silent festivities? Let's go! I don't have all day. Still have to get to the Jews. We are Jews. It says 14:30. We have to get to religious studies. Every day the same chaos. Alright. Get in. Have fun slaughtering sheep. Have fun making crosses. Peace and shalom brother. Good day! Yes I understand quite well. Mrs Tannenbaum, most people think of rabbis as old and male, right? I don't think sex or age is important. Not in love or as a rabbi. Regarding which issues are you not liberal? That's pigeonholing. But with regard to some rituals. Such as? Such as the circumcision of male offspring. Hello. Simon, right? Please sit. What's written on the cards? Do you already speak that much Hebrew? Of course. Tell me, does it look odd if I am up there holding the cards like in a catholic sermon? A little stiff? No, it looks very good. Very good. It's my first parish. I'm a little nervous. It'll certainly be great. Thank you. You know what? You remind me of someone. Did you like him? Yes very much. I realise that you didn't decide on a woman as rabbi by chance. No. Behind that lies the deep desire for innovation. I'm glad you want to walk this demanding path. That's what we get. There are countless of unemployed male rabbis in Eastern Europe. And who do we hire? It's my firm belief that the external innovation is the requirement for internal innovation. That's why I've thought of a joint project. A small construction project right outside. Our reader even managed to get original stones from Israel. We may pick them up at the wholesaler tomorrow at 5:30am. I look forward to seeing you in large numbers. Everything alright? Sure. To be honest, you don't look alright. Stop bothering her. What? Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Nothing will be flne. Simon! Leave me alone! Hello! 'Fabienne starts to sweat stronger from the fast movements. Her clothes would have stuck to her body if she'd been wearing anything.' I don't want to live with dad anymore. He annoys me. I wanted to talk to you about that. You're going away? Yes, for a reading tour. I'll jump in for another author. I'll read my story to different people in various places. I'll be back for your bar mitzvah. 'Edition Wagemut' That's not even a real publisher, is it? Don't look at me like that. If I sell 150 copies at each reading I'll get back the printing and traveling costs. You have to believe in yourself. And especially fight for what's important to you. Even if it's too big for oneself? Then especially That means you'll also come back if you can't sell all of them? Listen, I endured your father for fifteen years. You'll manage for three weeks. You should see him. Now that you're gone he follows every rule. Hello? Frank? Everything fine? I couldn't get you on the phone. Obviously it's Sabbath. I can't pick up. But you're good? Just forgot to turn on the lights. As long as it was allowed. And now? It's Sabbath. Now it's not allowed. But it's nice that you're here. Mom has to leave for three weeks. I got an offer for a reading tour. Really? It's a great opportunity. That's no problem. We'll have time for us two, Simon and me. Really? Thanks. A reading tour? Congratulation. One more thing. About Simon's decision. Don't get me wrong: Don't get any ideas. What do you mean? I am leaving him hear complete. And this completeness doesn't mean that - Where does it come from? This mistrust, this intolerance. It's a great pity... At this point I'd like to remind you that I'm leaving my son with someone who's afraid to use the light switch. Like I said: intolerant. Was I intolerant when you began making our lives a web of rules? No. Did I say anything when you quit your job to become a reader? No, 'if it makes him happy'. Some find meaning in tradition and spirituality But this isn't spirituality. It's compulsion neurosis. Others write pornos. You didn't even read the books. That's how occupied you were with your quest for meaning. 'Fabienne's apprenticeship in the creamery'. How can any grownup endure that? Please, Hannah. Welcome to the 'biblical Hebrew' course. I'm Zaba. A garden of wisdom awaits you. Hey! We have to show you something. Here in the basement. You're without me in my basement? We're waiting for you. You'll like it. What is that? Are you two crazy? We told you that we're going to help you. This is - All Rebecca. You haven't seen the best. Here. it's hers. Original item. Where did you get this from? Just picked it up. It's incredible what people throw away Well smell it. If you want her you have to know her, what she desires. Do you want her'? Yes. I want her. You're not the only one. He knows what he wants. He's further than you. You have to do something. Surprise her. Be yourself. That won't be enough. Don't panic though. We're going to find something. We are very happy to declare our Kottel, Wailing Wall, open. Thank you. This is completely meshuga. Frank as well. The two. If this innovation continues I'll convert. Certainly not to Buddhism. Frank? Did something happen? No, no, nothing. Let's begin. I just wanted to - Is it important? I have to go. Okay yes. Good luck. Yes thanks. Hannah? As far as Fabienne's gaze wandered she saw vines with firm grapes. The fruits were so ripe they were about to pop, squirt and gift their juices. Rebecca! Hey Simon. Shalom. Hello. Hello. We've built a Sukkot. Actually I did. There it is. My father wanted to buy a pre-built one. But I think it's important you build it yourself. I brought you something. It's been at my place for a while. It's the song of songs. It's small. But everything is in it. Thank you. Shalom. Nice to have you over. Shalom. Rabbi Moishe, he calls sometimes. Sends post cards. He seems to be happy in Israel. Oh yes,love. Well we are very happy to have such a committed successor. That's great to hear. We're truly happy. And also for the willingness to innovation. L'Chaim. When do you expect this innovation to be complete so we can get back to the order of the day? Difficult to say. It's simply a long path. Didn't you want to ask Frank about your illustrated book? What's it about? Well there is one thing I've been waiting to ask. The illustrated book. Didn't you tell me that your father hid in your basement for two years? Here in this basement? Yes my grandparents used to own the whole house. When they had to flee my father wanted to stay. He was just 16 but didn't want to leave. Could I see it? He died 14 months ago. I mean the basement. You want to see the basement? It could be a fitting scene. He already photographed over 150 hideouts. Horrible. It makes me a little uncomfortable. Don't worry about the mess. I'm used to it. If you don't mind I'd just like to check it out. Well... I'll show it to you. I heard myself speak and knew I only had one chance to prevent a catastrophe. Simon I'm not sure it's such a good idea. We could go right now. Well that's the spirit. Watch out for the steps. Simon. This way. Here it is. He hid over here. Oh. Right here. Are you sure? It seems rather narrow. Very cramped. When did you two separate? We're just taking a break. A few months back. It will work itself out. Here was a bed and over here a table. A very small one. If I had to choose a hiding place I would take the north side. Is there a light? No! You're not allowed to go in there. It's my dads room. I have a few more ideas for the parish. We can also meet outside of the parish. Amicably You want to protect your dad, right? Excuse me. Yes hello? It's very important that you listen very carefully. It's quite likely that you're in the presence of a very dangerous man. What? I'm talking about psychopathy You have to leave quickly. Okay. My wife is waiting in from of the house. Okay I'm coming. You knew about that room, right? Yes. Did you look at the pictures? My father gave them to me every night. He said it makes it easier to fall asleep. Your father was frequently in the basement, right? Yes. He's in the basement a lot. Almost every night. Simon, your dad has serious problems. Very serious. No police. He only observes them. Oh does it happen a lot? Simon? Frank, this is Dr Killy. We had to see something in your basement that shocked us. Humans have their proclivities but what you did is perverse and inexcusable. We took your good boy to a friend. He doesn't want to see you. Your own son! Shalom. First of all: Love isn't a fair game. And secondly: Secondly? First is enough. What am I supposed to do now? We're gonna think of something. Don't get weak on us. I had to find a way to impress Rebecca. Clemens gave me a few pills that helped me concentrate. He got the Ritalin from his violin teacher and generously gave it to me. Sukkot is around the corner. What do we celebrate during the Feast of Tabernacles? So the Feast of Tabernacles - Alright. They tried to kill us but we won and then we had dinner. Simon prepared something. He knows the whole song of songs by heart. In Hebrew. Simon? Behold,you are beautiful my love. Behold, beautiful like a pair of grapes are your eyes behind the veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats which run down the Gilead. Your lips are like scarlet ribbons and your mouth graceful. Your temple behind the veil is like a piece of pomegranate. Your two breasts are like gazelle twins pasturing between anemones. Your stature is beautiful, my love, and that - Thank you Simon. It was very impressive. Wandering through the desert, the Hebrew had no huts, no shelter. That's what the Feast of Tabernacles reminds us of. These brave boys from New Guinea receive cuts with a small knife, which makes them a man in the eyes of their tribe. Now he is a true warrior. Yes please? I have to talk to my son. Help, Mrs Kohler! He wants to get him for the circumcision. Simon, what's going on? He'll be right back, Mrs Kohler. Do you like spreading lies about me? Or was that supposed to be a joke? Well it's not funny Simon. Love isn't a fair game. What? 'My wife and I are only in a small slump.' Bullshit. I know exactly who you want. And who's that? We love the same woman. Bloody hell Simon. You are twelve. Rebecca is double your age. What do you think will happen between you two? Why do you care? Forget about her. I don't need advice from you. No woman stays with you. Why can't you just watch pornos like every boy your age or watch one of the girls from your class changing. You don't have anything to say? Frank, Frank, Frank. It's not like we whip ourselves for every triviality like our catholic friends. But you really took a misstep. Used toiletries. You have to think of that first. In over 20 years as a psychiatrist Half of it as a chief physician I've maybe seen this with two patients. One of them was this rapist. Didn't he kill himself? That was the other one. He was stalking woman in the double digits, similarly compulsive. He then went on to hang himself while in custody Exactly We don't want to completely destroy your life. We're not going to press charges. That's also the wish of our rabbi. She asked not to be here today Yes. Frank? Yes? We don't want to see you near the premises anymore. Maybe it will work itself out with you. 'Shoteh lo samei be-ydan' - the wise men say. Once insane, always insane. Your lovely son is always welcome. We're going to try and support him the best way possible. Do you want me to come with you? Something like this is awkward. But a man has to do what he has to do. I'm going to manage alone. That's what I thought. You'll see, you'll feel better afterwards. Simon! I'm glad I can be here for you. I, I have to say something. You probably want to share a lot. You can tell me everything. I, I. At one point my mom just couldn't take it anymore. I don't know what to say I've never thought your father would be capable of that. He went to a psychiatrist who told him that he doesn't know any better. He doesn't take the medicine either. Him of all people. I thought there was a special bond between him and me. Something special. Not anymore, right? Looking at Rebecca, I thought I've never seen something more beautiful. Do you want to go to the cinema? You are going through a lot. Everything is spinning. It can be a film about love or something like that. Or a different one,Action? May I Sit? I don't know. Better not. What are you doing here? I was back there and observing you two. What? I couldn't help myself. I'm sorry And you two talked? Yes, we just finished. I'd like to take the chance and apologize. It's a little my fault. I don't know what's up with you. I'm not a psychologist but what you're doing in front of your son is a sad perversion. Great, everything has been said. We can go now. Simon what did you do? Can't we just leave? Please? You don't have to leave with him if you don't want to. We'll find a way. it's better I don't leave him alone now. Why? Why are you such a coward? To Rebecca you're nothing more than a little boy. A child. Why don't you get that? Forget about her. Why don't you forget about my circumcision? What? You understood me. Forget my foreskin. You can tell me everything. And you can touch me wherever you want. I understand. Regarding which issues are you not liberal? That's pigeonholing. But with regard to some rituals. Such as? Such as the circumcision oi male offspring. Dad, Dad! I made up my mind to say goodbye to my foreskin. Preferably soon. Simon, the circumcision is the sign of your bond with god. You can't use that to reconcile with me. You haven't understood anything I've told you the last couple of weeks. You haven't either. I'm going over to your mom. You stay here. Dad, let's make an appointment for my circumcision first. We're going to talk about that. Not everything is about you. Wow. Then you go to her and say that you did everything for her. That's very, very manly Do you think so? Of course! It reminds me of Ariel, the little mermaid. She sacrifices her fishtail and ends up as foam. What are you talking about? Your friend is going to be a hero and you are talking about mermaids. Have you asked your parents? Should he ask his mom before he scores a chick? I'm just saying. Very romantic gesture. Gonna wipe her off her feet. Guaranteed. Grunberg, Simon? Preferably alone. I'm supposed to perform a circumcision without medical indication, preferably today It would be awesome if you could fit me in. With a highly potent anesthesia on behalf of your parents who couldn't be her personally Yeah it sucks but they have to work. You have the letter with their signatures. I see two options. Could you do it today! You do n't say anything more. Nod for a 'Yes', shake your head for a 'No'. Option one:The insurance sent you. Routine check. I thought these criminals are capable of that. Option two: It has something to do with the two clowns outside. Some prepubescent idiocy, a dare or lost bet? Listen, I'm awake since yesterday morning. I don't have time for this shit. If you come here again trying to imprison a doctor with your arrogant games, I'm gonna play along and cut of your testicles. Understood? Yes. Again: The tissue is severed at the skin of the penis shaft and the external pan is taken off from the internal. Incredible. It comes from playing the violin. Steady hands. We just have to make sure that you don't faint on us again. I think I can do it. No! None of you idiots will operate on me. Magic-Ring. Say goodbye to your foreskin. Fast and painless. After a few days wearing the ring your foreskin will die off and fall off. Painless - Like magic. Take advantage of our 'Morning Hour' - Express. Order now via credit card. Start into your new life tomorrow. We could try. To provide the right size and safety we offer four sizes: S,M, L,XL. You have to choose there. I think mine would be L. Yes. XL would be too big. I agreed with dad to stay at Ben's place but I had different plans. Are you going to be alright? Sure. Do n't worry about me. Fine. Only now did she see Marco. The youngest of the vintner brothers who was picking grapes a few meters away. Marco's gaze with his dark brown eyes met Fabienne like an arrow of passion. The autumn foliage rustled below their bodies The warm sunrays hit Fabienne's milky skin like melting honey. His hard loins slapped against her smooth thighs. She was shivering but it wasn't because of the cold, on the contrary As she was shaken by the aftershocks she sank into his warm, deep embrace. Thank you. Thank you. If you want to read the whole book you may buy it here today and if you own a copy already I'm happy to sign it. I read your book. I really read it now. How you describe the vineyards like for example the slope. Fabienne and Marco roll down the slope in deep embrace, page 82 until their orgasm on page 84. Well are the vineyards in Switzerland or maybe France? I did a little research. In the south of France there are really steep slopes. To be honest- Wait. They rent out rooms with a hillside view. I already booked. No Sabbath, no prayers, no kosher food, just us two. But we can't handle five minutes without fighting. But that can change, Hannah. Frank, I've been thinking as well. What's between us isn't enough. It just isn't enough. We have different notions of happiness. Four and a half minutes and we're sitting here in perfect harmony Yes please? Boss. There's a problem with two guests. Two guests? 100 guests is a problem but two. Do they speak English? No. They're fighting. And because of that you call the boss. I'm going to break that habit of yours. And what is the fight about? Something about religion. If I understood correctly it's about the circumcision of their son. How do they look? I should have never left him with you. I'm just letting you know about his wish. And where does it suddenly come from? Maybe from his uptight father? That's freedom of religion. And him going after a rabbi three times his age, is that freedom of religion as well? It was only 2-3 photos. What's the big deal? You should have told me right away You don't have time for things like that. You're too busy with Fabienne's bodily fluids. I take care of Simon. Don't start with the self-pity again. What does it have to do with self-pity? I come here and the only thing expecting me is war. Self-pity. That's exactly what I'm talking about. You don't even know what that is. Stop screaming around. When was the last time we stayed in a hotel room together? No idea. We probably screamed at each other. The guys in your story, the Vintners, are they autobiographical? Frank, sex was never our problem. If applied incorrectly; swellings may occur. Caution! Discoloration of the glans may indicate low blood flow. Unfortunately during religion studies the situation got more serious. Simon? it's me. Everything's great. Stop shitting me. Open the door. Don't. Panic. That piece of crap has to go. It doesn't go off you idiot. What are you doing? I saw this in a movie. I'm afraid we have to tie it off. Boys, is everything alright? Should I come in? He probably ate something spoiled. What's happening? Are you the mother? I'm the rabbi. And that happened during religious studies? I think I'm ready Hannah Grunberg,hello? Yes that's my son. He did what? The urologist will be here in a moment. You shouldn't be in pain anymore. With that dose you could cut off your finger and you wouldn't feel a thing. Thank you for coming with me. I have to tell you something. The pictures in our basement, the collection, it's mine. And what did you do here? That wasn't that great. But why? So you'd believe me that I love you. What did you just say? 975 01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:19,956 I love you. Simon you are 12 and I'm 32. I don't care. Sometimes we fall in love with the wrong person. There is a substitute for everything in life but not for the first love. I have to go into the city. We won't be an item, will we? No we won't. You're sure, right? You're a great guy but: Yes. Just so there are no misunderstandings. That's as farewell. Starting now you only nod or shake your head, understood? Yes, of course. What? When you were in dreamland I had the great honour to examine your art piece. Medically, this is what happened: Simon. Come here. What happened? Medically, this is what happened: Hey Simon. Is it a bad time? How is our little surgeon? You didn't become king but you saw the castle. Listen, I haven't slept for 40 hours, I'd like to share my diagnosis. Please be quiet everyone. We can't hear a word of what the doctor's saying. The patient achieved a so called 'Circumcisio Deformis'. A crooked circumcision. Medically and functionally it's harmless but optically: He won't become a nude model. What's the goy talking about. is the boy circumcised or not? That's not the issue here. Could everyone leave who doesn't have a task here. We could vote whether it's a circumcision or not. Now that the boy went through all the trouble you want to invalidate it? Hannah! Welcome back to the parish. This wasn't an admission to your folklore. On the ground floor we have a multi-confessional room of silence. How about you discuss down there how you want to proceed with this 12 year old maniac? How about you go down to that room of silence and leave your diagnosis there. My circumcision went through unanimously. After everyone left I realised I lost two things: My foreskin or at least part of it. and my first love. Opposite to that I didn't care about my foreskin. Strangely, Rebecca wasn't the person I was thinking about the most. Simon. Can we go home? I thought we could bury this together. Of course. What is it? 16.000 nerve endings. That's how you do it, right? On sacred ground. I have to give it to you: You don't give up quickly. That makes two of us. Your mother was the first person I loved. You're getting divorced, right? And what's with Rebecca? What's with Rebecca? If you want to meet up you can do that. She likes you if you haven't noticed. Body language. Can't do anything about it. What are we burying here anyway? Apiece of sausage. And where is...? Somewhere in the hospital basement. We hope you are happy with the result of the transplant. What did you implant? It looks great. The moment your wife takes this document the divorce will be official. Somehow I wasn't surprised that almost everyone from our parish came. We didn't want to leave you alone during this difficult moment. We have to especially apologize to you, Frank. We were too quick to judge. Regarding yourself Simon: In the beginning of puberty we all went through phases of confusion. Aaron's mom told me for example that he kept trying with a chicken to - I don't think anyone wants to know about that. I'm actually interested. I'm going to check on dinner. A chicken? Yes. Rebecca was beautiful as always. Maybe even prettier. And the logical consequence is to resign. I think that's good. Please don't. You have no idea how long we looked for our last rabbi. But then I thought that giving up is the wrong sign. And I've thought of new ways for innovation. New ways? More building alterations? I want to expand the mass with a theoretical block. We're starting with the perspective of the Jewish feminist theology Meanwhile Ben succeeded in coming closer to my mom. And Fabienne ran, didn't look around, until the sweet juice was dried up completely. You know everything by heart? You've created something great. I mean that. First they are dismissive and then they don't want you to leave. They just need time. Maybe. And me? What should I say? Is it all true? What is? That you did the crooked circumcision yourself? Yes it's true. Can I see? If you prefer we can dance first. It became a legendary feast. That was two weeks ago. Today is the day of my bar mitzvah. The religious tradition says that I'm a man now. Are you ready? Simon says goodbye to his foreskin ELEMENT E 2015
