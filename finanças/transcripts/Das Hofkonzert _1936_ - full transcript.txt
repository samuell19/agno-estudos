The Court Concert Bravo, very good. - Your Grace ... - You know, my dear, yesterday it all sounded a bit heavy, not yet floating, not yet light and easy. But now it was very good. Since this is the 7th rehearsal. How kind of you to appreciate it, Your Grace. Excellent. Or maybe it just seems to me. Does Your Grace think that ... I mean, if you, like I do, listen to the same music each year, your ear is no longer impartial, isn't it, Artistic Director? But Your Grace is so musical. I get along so far, as you can see. For a great musician, I didn't have the stuff it takes, only for a little Prince. - And that's of no consequence. - But Your Grace ... Trust me, my dear: music ... music and love, these are the only things worth living for. But I've always remained a dilettante, in both fields. But now the main part, the song! Forgive me, Your Grace ... Our Song! Where's our singer? - Unfortunately a calamity. - Why? Something wrong with Tamara? She's ill, Your Grace. She claims she's unable to sing in 2 days at the concert. - What does she have? - She has a ... She has, she has, she's always "having". She'd better not "have", it's always the same with her. Forgive me, Your Grace, maybe the tenor could sing something ... - The tenor? - from an opera. You seem to forget that the Little Court Concert has its established program for 20 years. Let's avoid all changes. - Of course, Your Excellency. - Have you already sent for the doctor? - Of course, Your Excellency. We shouldn't employ such an unreliable person. Since she's already under contract ... Very true. Who says "A" must also say "B". Please give me an "A". Once again. I can't. I don't understand how one can catch a cold in this heat. You don't understand? You don't understand? - But Madame ... - When my heart hurts, my throat hurts too. Oh, the brute! A brute? Look at this. All those lies... He no longer wants to see me. I think I must die, right on the spot. He's left me. For another. Quel malheur. Calm yourself, Madame. I'll prescribe for you some drops, you take them with hot water, Oh, I'm in such pain. - In your throat? - No, here. Say, Madame, when you are disappointed down here, do you always feel pain up there? Yes! I get hoarse at once, like a stick. How long does it last? Very long. Till my heart starts laughing again. - And then you recover at once? - The same minute. Listen Madame, forgive the indiscreet question: Could your heart possibly start laughing again before the concert? I mean, the young Baron Linden is such a fervent admirer. No, doctor, no no no, I always grieve for a long period. At least a week. A pity. A pity. Otherwise I'd have prescribed the young Baron Linden ... Three times per day? And quite hot? Is there no replacement for Tamara? - Not here with us, Your Grace, but in Vienna there's ... - Vienna? Vienna seems a bit too far away. - Well, Your Grace ... - What about Munich? In Munich there's Bellotti, a very young singer. - Bellotti? - She's charming, her voice ... - Very well. Nobody sings like the Cavalleri anyway. There you are, my dear Doctor. What did you find out? From a medical point of view a very interesting case: We are dealing with a zyniertis affiontalis hyperbis combined with a chloritic neoplexis which could easily develop into a chronic manifonitis. Even the healthiest person would get ill from all that. - Isn't it right, my good Vogel? - Yes, Your Grace. - And how long will it last? - At least a week. - Far too long, dear Arnegg, you'll arrange with that singer from Munich. Send for her. Spare no costs. - The princely coach. - Where to? - By order of the Prince, to Munich, to fetch a lady singer. A lady singer? Enjoy your charge. You may pass. Passport control, if you please. - Thank you. - Won't you let the lady get out first? - Here you are. - Thank you. - But ... - I'm in a hurry. - You can wait. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Here you are. - Thank you. Thank you - you're welcome you're welcome - thank you Could the passport control be hurried up a bit? - My name is Zunder. I must get today to ... - Careful! - Mademoiselle ... - Christine Holm. Lieutenant von Arnegg. Eyes: blue. Correct. Hair: blond. That's also correct. - Nose ... - Ordinary. - That's not correct. - If you please, Lieutenant. - You're welcome, Mademoiselle. Mouth: unusually pretty. Particularities: not inclined to condone molesting. I'm terribly sorry we have to trouble you. Terribly sorry. Allow me: Lieutenant Schw√§lble. - You see, Miss, we're only doing our duty. - You're overdoing it!! - I must ask you ... - Not to leave the coach until we've finished our controls. If you please. - Inspection of the luggage is obligatory. - To preserve the peace of the land. I don't think it contains anything that could endanger the peace of the land. I'm afraid it does. For instance this. Don't be presumptuous, Lieutenant. After all, I'm not sitting here for my pleasure. I refuse to be locked up in that box. Do you know what ... Do you know what that is? Wrongful deprivation of liberty. I'm being kept waiting for hours while the officers exert themselves over that Demoiselle. Thank you, Mademoiselle, we're done. - Now you can inspect the excited gentleman. - Yessir. Nobody shall call me impolite. - When someone is in such a hurry, let me tell you ... - Next, please. You'd better bring in my luggage. The officers seem to have finished with the lady. Too kind that you've remembered me at all. - One moment, sir. - Very well. You'd better stay at the Silvery Moon. Is the Silvery Moon the only hotel in town? The only one Lieutenant von Arnegg can see from his windows. I recommend the Blue Fish, a traditional inn of good repute. - Very well, I'll take the Blue Fish. - But that's opposite his own quarters. - Take the lady's luggage to the Silvery Moon. - No, to the Blue Fish, do you hear! Very well, sir, to the Blue Fish. But the Blue Fish is so noisy. - To the Silvery Moon! - But the Silvery Moon is always ... What's this? What's the meaning of this? The mail coach is leaving? Of course it is. Scheduled departure. Stop! Stop! Do you realize that I'm sitting here, with all my luggage. - I'm sorry, sir. - You're not at all sorry! I'll notify your superiors. This is the Silvery Moon. I see, the Silvery Moon. And the Blue Fish? The Blue Fish is over there. - Over there? - So where does the demoiselle wish her luggage to be taken to? Which place did the Lieutenant recommend? - Lieutenant von Arnegg or ... - The strapping one. - He recommended the Silvery Moon. I mean, he isn't exactly strapping. - Lieutenant von Arnegg! - But he's also rather fat. That would suit that officer fine, wouldn't it, to peep into my windows. The demoiselle will stay at the Blue Fish. Very well. Yes ... that is ... no! I heard the inn is very noisy till late at night. - Then I don't know. - Well ... What am I to do? I always count off my buttons. Your buttons? Wonderful. Silvery Moon, Blue Fish. Silvery Moon, Blue Fish. Silvery Moon. Since fate has decided, we'll go to the ... Silvery Moon. # on a pure spring morning the shepherdess went out and sang # young and pretty and without worries her song sounded through the woods # So la la la la la la # Thyrsis offered her for a mouthful ??? 2, 3 sheep on the spot # she thought for a while, then she just sang and laughed # So la la la la # another one offered her ribbons, a third one offered his heart # but she had her fun with ribbons and hearts, just as with the lambs # tra la la la la What! You haven't kept the room I reserved a week ago? Since the gentlemen didn't arrive with the mail coach ... - I didn't arrive! Indeed! Shame on you! - Please, sir ... I have travelled far, but this beats it all! Having to walk to this place! All because of those idiots. Of course the mail coach had left by that time, because the officer on duty had to flirt with some wench. But I'll show that Lieutenant von ... von ... one moment ... Lieutenant von Arnegg. - I'll make him pay! - He's the State Minister's son. State Minister, my foot! Surely the State Minister can't be indifferent about how foreigners are being treated. I'm only a simple travelling corsets salesmen. Imagine Metternich had been in that mail coach. With the general rearmament in Europe, we'd have a pretty war on our hands by tomorrow. I still have a small room over the stables. Over the stables? I demand my room, the one I've reserved. - Please tell the gentlemen you put in my room ... - It's not a gentleman. - It isn't? - It's the lady who came with the mail coach. - What? - Could the gentleman make up his mind now? - Always those women! - Room 36 is still vacant. - Do you know how much it costs me! - One taler per day. What it costs me to be calm! I demand my room! - This is intolerable! - Service and meals included. That woman! I'm going crazy. Shall I tell you who that lady really is whom the gentlemen took in as a guest in his hotel? The shady dame I was talking about, she seduced that fop, that Lieutenant von Arnegg. Whom were you talking about? - But Walter! - Speak up! - I don't have justify myself to you. - You blackguard. Slandering a defenseless lady. Hey there! What's going on? An officer quarrelling with a travelling salesman. Parbleu! What's the enemy's position? I forbid you to use that tone. Or I'll slap your face. Gentlemen, consider the other guests ... You're nothing but a mean blackguard, so I've noticed. Lieutenant von Arnegg! I don't like my officers to get into fights. My name's Zunder. Zunder. I'm having a peaceful conversation with this gentleman, suddenly I'm being attacked in a manner ... Herr von Arnegg? Indeed, the gentleman had a peaceful conversation and had no other intention but to talk about a lady in a way that would make her suspicious for everybody. I demanded an apology. This is about a person - I made a note of her name - who is a menace to public morals. - That's enough, sir! - Lieutenant! I beg your pardon, Colonel. Are you willing to give satisfaction to me and the lady? - Satisfaction? - I'm asking for the last time: Explain your impatience, Lieutenant von Arnegg. - An explanation, very good. - Don't force me to give you an order. The lady is my fianc√©e. In that case I offer my formal apologies. But I'm afraid, Lieutenant, you won't be able to prove it. Here you are, darling. I'm sorry I've kept you waiting. Come with me. I thank you. You know, I've come here to look for my father. - Your father? - Yes. My mother met him here. She must have loved him a lot. But then, she suddenly left town and didn't see him again before she died. She never told me the reason. And you don't know his name? No. All the evidence I have is ... is this. - A poem? - Yes. Dedicated to my mother. And the author's name? - Celestin... - Knips! - You know him? - No, I don't. But I think it's funny somebody's name is Knips. But Herr von Arnegg, I asked you to be serious. I beg your pardon. And that's why you want to visit Knips? Yes. He knew my mother, maybe he can tell me something But not today! You've waited so long looking for your father... - For 18 years, right? - Almost 19. 19? Then it's high time. - You're hopeless. - Is that all? Very well. I'll postpone it till tomorrow. You know, dear Vogel, there's one night each year I'm really looking forward to: The night of the Little Concert. We almost had to call it off. That Artistic Director is such an idiot. - Yes, Your Grace. - Wanting to let the tenor sing. My dear Vogel, you see, tomorrow it'll be exactly 20 years. Yes, Your Grace. Where's that music coming from? That must be the amusement park. # Happiness, bliss, each day sunshine # thus people in love go through life # they don't hear. They don't see. They're happy forever # because they drift away from the daily grind # how wonderful it is to be in love # when the hearts beat # how wonderful it is to be in love # when the eyes ask # when the yearning lips can't speak # and when the hearts only think of one thing # when you have to hide a thousand feelings # until the first blissful kiss # how wonderful it is to be in love # so don't ask, don't speak, be mine Everything turning round, singing, laughing ... My dear Vogel, I too want to get into such a merry-go-round one day. Isn't this a great idea? Go on, say it, say "Yes, Your Grace". - No, Your Grace. - Vogel, you're a spoil-sport. Did you see the girl in the swing? Yes, Your Grace. Sometimes I feel afraid that I'm old already. And the world is still so young. Listen, let's walk in the palace garden, so that we won't be observed. # bread and money of this world don't make likfe worth living # if one had to stay alone with it # if I have you all to myself, then happiness will enter the home # love makes you richer than money # how wonderful it is to be in love # when the hearts beat # how wonderful it is to be in love # when the eyes ask # when the yearning lips can't speak # and when the hearts only think of one thing # when you have to hide a thousand feelings # until the first blissful kiss # how wonderful it is to be in love # so don't ask, don't speak, be mine - Herr von Arnegg! - My dear Countess. - I thought you'd bring your on too. - I'm surprised myself. √Ä propos surprise, I've taken the liberty to bring you someone who'll show you the latest invention. A popo ... no a photography machine. What an impossible name. Countess, a gentleman from Vienna has arrived, with the corsets. - At your service, Countess. - So late? I have visitors for tea. My dear, do come in for a moment. I apologize for being late, but I was detained at the customs office. The corsets I've ordered from Vienna. They're charming, aren't they? - Some gallant woman ... - A gallant ... ? Yes, a gallant woman who arrived with me. The model "Elvira". Please notice the modern simplified fastenings at the back. In just half an hour this corset can be put on. I've taken the liberty to try it out with your maid. That's progress! Progress! "Time is money", as the Americans say. And thus the good old times sink into the grave. Yes. Made from the best silk. No seams. Extremely durable. No, I mean the person you just mentioned. - Yes. - I see. Her. A deplorable sight, shady characters in this dignified city, within its walls ... By the way, I have the same model in moir√©e, with a flower pattern. The latest: ultra-thin fishbone. Both pliable and strong, the most elegant ... - Countess, just look... - I'd like to try on a few things. Of course the Countess' figure is different. What business has that shady woman in our city? She's looking for her father, as she told the innkeeper. The most charming thing you can imagine. Lacroix in Paris charges 5 louis d'or for it. A poem. When at night I'm on duty at the ... - post - post, and march 1000 steps, whether the Heaven sheds tears, whether it's night, whether it's day or ... - Night. - night. Each hour I feel ... - My girl. - lips What a pretty poem. - And the flowers! - Ah yes ... I'd never have thought that a simple soldier could make such pretty rhymes. - Your rhymes are much prettier. - No, yours. Does one of the gentlemen want to have his photo taken? No, thanks. Since nobody dares, then I'll try. - Bravo, Your Excellency. - Minister, please be careful. If you please, Your Excellency. This is the first time in the history of photography that a Minister has his photo taken. I must fasten His Excellency's head, otherwise the photo will be blurred. A new procedure to achieve a more gracious and natural posture in the photo. Ladies and gentlemen, please step back. If possible, behind the camera. - Come, Mama. - Please, a bit further away. - How long will it last? - The exposure is very fast. I count slowly to 45. Please don't move your face, otherwise I can't guarantee a successful photo. Here we are. Now smile, Your Excellency. Smile. If you please, an amiable look. Are you comfortable, Countess? Not quite. - I think it makes me look a bit fat. - Fat? Impossible, with your graceful waist. Of course it must be tightly laced. All right, I'll try. Not so tight! I can't breathe. I wonder what's taking Babette so long? - Impossible. The corset's lining is too thick. I don't understand it. Did I give you a wrong model? Those brutes at the customs control rifled through all my merchandise. As if a honourable travelling corsets salesman would carry undeclared wares in his luggage. Would the Countess allow me personally to have a look ... - You? - Impossible! A man! As to this, Madame can rest reassured. I see nothing. I close my eyes. - Well, if you really ... - Parole d'honneur. - Very well. - Very well. Permit me, Countess. The lacings ... please. One moment. It won't work. What's this? Two cigars. Parole d'honneur. I don't understand how they got into the corset. A slight mistake. - Now you've opened your eyes! - Mille pardons. I'm all mixed up. First the affair with that Lieutenant von Ar ... I see ... von Arnegg who intends to marry such a dame. - Marry? - Yes. They're already engaged. Engaged? Let's go right now and tell the old Arnegg. Just another moment. 36... Your Excellency, this wasn't nice of you! - Keep your pose, 37 ... - That you've kept the big family event secret. 38... 39... A big family event? I just learned that His Excellency's son has become engaged. - to a certain demoiselle Holm. - 40,41... A charming young girl from the very best family. - 42 ... - Only, her father is unknown. - 43 ... - Please Your Excellency, an amiable look, don't move. 44... Please smile, Your Excellency. Smile! 45. We're done, Your Excellency. I thank you. I was notified of the affair from several sides. I can imagine, the story is incredible. The Dptm. of Justice will issue an order of expulsion. Of course. The person must be removed. By tomorrow at noon she will have left town, understood? - You'll see to it personally, Colonel. - Of course, Your Excellency. And be discreet. A closed carriage, an inconspicuous military escort. I don't want His Grace to learn about the affair. If our dear Minister of State von Arnegg knew about it, my good Vogel, that you secretly provide me with newspapers ... Yes, Your Grace. It isn't silly what those people write in here. Not silly at all. Sometimes I think ... from a people a great thing could be created. For instance, a people. Isn't it true, my dear Vogel? Yes, Your Grace. You're very talkative again today, my dear Vogel. - Get down from that chicken ladder of yours. - Yes, Your Grace. To the devil with all those books ... I wish I were young again. - Have you ever been young, my dear Vogel. - I was, Your Grace. Really? I can't imagine. The older you get the smaller the world becomes, circling around men and things. - Yes, Your Grace. Of my entire life nothing remains ... but a song. Actually, I was going to stay over there: - at the Fish. - Yes. All the same you chose The Moon. By accident. A bugle. The Lieutenant Florian Schw√§lble. Now he got stuck. Stuck again. # Now the day folds its wings # and falls asleep in the twilight # now the wind wanders from the valleys and the hills # down into the woods # in a peaceful circle the town's streets and houses are resting # from all the windows the lovely lights are quietly looking out # the lovely lights looking out # there goes a loving soul # along the twilight alleys # suddenly in the throat blooms a strange magical song # the perfume of carnations and roses rising ??? # and now the senses have flown out, into the silent night I beg your pardon. Come in. Good day, Herr Knips? Am I disturbing? I want to pay my debts. Who pays his debts never disturbs. Nine stanzas, each with two lines, right? - 1 groschen per line. - Here you are. My young friend, even Pegasus cannot do without the crib. What was this? Merci. For Saturday night I'd like to have a new poem. - Very well. - But nothing about flowers and spring, we did that too often before. Nothing about nature. Write about "Menschen". [mankind] For "Mensch" there's no rhyme, young friend. Man is a creature without a rhyme. I mean, Babette gave me a pair of "pulse warmers". [wristlets] and I'd like to thank her in rhymes. Pulse warmers? How about: "My pulse beats warmer, sweet heart, when I see you." Great, that's great, that's ... art. One gives the best one can. Couldn't you insert that Babette should wear her light blue dress, with the pink ribbons? The light blue dress, with the pink ribbons? It's a deal. - Babette too writes me poems. - Really? Yours are nothing compared to hers. I wouldn't have started writing poems myself, but women always go for the poetic. to the beloved ... - Here you are. - Did you make it 10 stanzas? Because Veit wrote me 9 the last time. His poems are so good, yours cannot compare. How could I compete with a Homer? - You have a visitor. Again, many thanks. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - A good day. - A good day. - Is this Herr Knips' residence? - In personam. Won't the lady sit down? Perhaps on these books? By the way, nothing but tragedies. Thank you, I can stand. I would have offered you this chair. Unfortunately it has only three legs. Maybe we can put the books underneath, then it'll work. We humans make do with only two legs. Pardon. How can I be of service? Where did I leave my glasses? Yes? Did you know a singer Angelika Holm? Holm? Let me search for her in my memories. Holm... - I've got it. - You have? My glasses. No, the name Holm is unknown to me. Is there another poet named Celentin Knips in this town? No, I'm the last Knips. Perhaps also the last poet. Another of those idiotic orders. In this country the army is the general dogsbody. What's wrong? I'm to arrest a female and take her across the border. - A certain demoiselle Holm. - Holm? - Hotel Silvery Moon. - That's impossible! Impossible? You must be crazy. Give it to me. Who gave you this sheet? - It belonged to my mother. - Really? - She died. - She's dead? From her estate I learned that the man she was married to and whom I'd always thought of as my father, was only my guardian. His name was Holm. But in this city lived the man she loved, the man I'm searching for now. Look at this painting. This is your mother, 20 years ago. Angelika Cavallieri. That was my mother's stage name. You knew her? Yes. A little. From the stage. But I once sang her a song, she liked it so much that she had it set to music. And later she sang it at the Court Concert. I remember the melody exactly. I sat in the last row and listened to her. I shall never forget her voice. # do you never think of what may happen? # one day you'll forget me # and what am I without you # tell me # do you never think of what may happen? # one day you'll write to me # "don't wait in front of my door any longer" # maybe tomorrow I'll receive your final letter # because each happiness is like a bouquet of roses # each love withers, that's the old eternal song # and what am I when my dream melts away # do you never think of what may happen? # one day you'll forget me # and what am I without you # tell me # do you never think of what may happen? # one day you'll write to me # "don't wait in front of my door any longer" # how they faded away # the memories Angelika Cavallieri. How wonderful that her child sings me her song today. - Do you know who loved her? - Everybody. One couldn't help loving her. I mean, whom did she love? Who was my father? I know only one thing. It must have been a person of high rank. Someone at court. When will the carriage with that singer from Munich be back? - We're expecting her tomorrow afternoon, Your Grace. - Bravo, bravo! Tell me, my dear Arnegg, will the people cheer her a bit at the reception? That Italian lady is a well-known artist, isn't she? She's famous, Your Grace. But she's German, as far as I know. Bellotti is her stage name. - Very well, a German. - Allow me. - Thank you. So, at the reception, an average cheer from the people, throwing a few caps into the air ... - After you. - Thank you. And where will you put her up? She'll stay in the garden palace, as guest of Countess Hadersdorff, With our good mistress of ceremonies. I hope she doesn't have the bad manners of the stage. Let's hope for the best. In the Mayor's offices the files of all the citizens are stored. Also from the old times. Where did I ... Here it is. There we'll find out all the details. An officer. An officer? I think he's come to fetch me. I must ask you to get ready for your immediate departure. I've already had your luggage brought from the hotel. I have orders to escort the demoiselle to the border. Beautiful weather today, Mademoiselle. We'll have a most agreeable voyage. And when I heard you were going to be expulsed, I volunteered to command the escort. I had to see you once more. But what reason do they have to expulse me? My father has learned about the incident, that I presented you to some people as my fianc√©e. And he wasn't exactly pleased that you don't know your own father. Whether he's pleased or not, I'll come back, even if he expulses me ten times. - You don't know him. - He doesn't know me. Even if he expulses me 20 times I'll show him I won't be kept from searching for my father ... Everything's been taken care of, Your Excellency. So, the demoiselle will be outside our borders by morning. Hallo, Fritz! Where have you left your singer? Has she run off? Go away with that Bellotti. I couldn't find her in all Munich. - What can I do for you? For you? Nothing. - With whom do I have the honour. - Demoiselle Holm. You may stick to my stage name. - Stage name? - Yes. Weren't you looking for a demoiselle Bellotti? And you are ... The singer Bellotti from Munich. On the order of His Grace, His Grace asks Mlle Bellotti to participate in tomorrow's Court Concert. I feel honoured by His Grace's invitation. I accept. Famous? Ha! I've never heard that name. Never! Still hoarse. Not a note in my throat. Otherwise I'd show that ... that ??? Ridiculous! What a monstrous reception! Look at this! Horses! - A very polite young man. - Isn't he? A charming officer. Very attractive. As long as the demoiselle is a guest in my house, you'll be at her disposition, understood? Excuse me, she's arriving. If you please ... Yes. State Minister, as ordered I present the demoiselle Bellotti from Munich. Mademoiselle, as State Minister of my august Prince I have the honour to welcome you in Immendingen. Countess Hadersdorff will ... But that's ... You're the State Minister? The father of Lieutenant von ... It's a hoot! I beg your pardon? A hoot? I don't understand. Forgive me, Your Excellency, but you'll soon laugh as well. Bellotti is only my stage name and - But this is the Holm woman. - Holm? But she was ... Expulsed by orders of His Excellency. That's right. But this is ... - how ... - How did I dare to come back? Because of your august Prince. But if you like, I can leave again. No Mademoiselle, stay! Good Heavens ... Since you aren't pleased by my presence ... But I am! I'm extraordinarily pleased. Then I'll stay of course. Since you wish it so. Pardon, one moment. You'll be presented to His Grace tonight, Mlle Belotti. May I count on it that the demoiselle Holm will have forgotten by then what has happened? - Did anything happen? - I thank you. I invite you to stay at my palace while you're here. Thank you. Your Excellency. Mademoiselle. Colonel! Please look after the demoiselle's well-being. - Of course. - By the way, one of your officers disobeyed my express orders. I'm referring to Lieutenant von Arnegg. Lieutenant von ... What does Your Excellency mean? Confine him to his room for a few days, to keep him from further reckless enterprises. Thank you, Colonel. A hoot, isn't it? Excellent! - Do you like it here? - Very much. When I look at you, this is curious, it seems to me I have seen you before somewhere. - Why shouldn't you? - This isn't very probable, Mlle, - since you've come to Immendingen for the first time. - Of course. I hope my dear Immendingenians knew at your reception what they owe to such a charming guest. Yes Your Grace, they did, your dear Immendingenians. For instance, the officer who was ordered to entertain me, from here to the border. You mean, from the border to here. Anyway, it was an unforgettable drive, wasn't it, Your Excellency? Perhaps our singer will permit me tomorrow to take her for a drive to show her the sights ... And I recommend to the lady to inspect a good parade ground. - And our children's home. - With the big swing. The big swing? Yes Your Grace, the big swing in the Amusement Park. I see, in the Amusement Park ... Our guest seems to know her way around Immendingen's geography. The officer who escorted the demoiselle from Munich must have told her about it. - Isn't it so? - Of course. - Perhaps you'll delegate another officer to accompany the demoiselle tomorrow. Maybe your son, Herr von Arnegg. - He's busy. - Ah? - On duty. May I offer you some? For how long? For the duration of your visit, Mademoiselle. Damned confinement to room. Jean Paul: "My years as a lout" Shut up! Get me another bottle of wine, maybe that'll give me an idea. Yes sir. - What is it? - The Bellotti gets a guard of honour. Tomorrow I'm on duty. Tomorrow you're on ... Tomorrow you're on duty? That's splendid, my dear, that you want to stay a few days more. I already guessed that the demoiselle has some private business here. Why bother with allusions, Your Excellency? Your alleged information are quite correct. I admit openly that I'm searching for my father here. How interesting. I'm not ashamed at all, Your Grace. This honours you, my child. Don't you agree, Minister? Certainly, Your Grace. That's why I want to visit the Mayor's Office tomorrow morning. I wish you the best of luck in your research. - Your Grace ... - Yes? I like you. Is it permitted to say this at all? On the contrary! Because I like you just as much. Did you see her smug expression when that dame made her flattering remarks? Your Excellency can rest reassured. Lieutenant von Arnegg has already received his order of confinement to his room. - We must avoid at all costs that the two meet. - Of course. And if you have any worries, just come to me. There's something I'd like to ask, Your Grace. As long as it's in my power. So, what is it you wish, Mademoiselle? - It isn't for myself, but for another. - For another? - Do I know him? - Unfortunately Your Grace doesn't know him at all. The man is called Knips. He's a poet, and very poor. A poet? Living in our capital? Without my knowing him? Immendingen is not that big. Anyway, I'd like that gentleman - what was his name again? - Knips. - that Mr. Knips to make my acquaintance since the demoiselle recommends him so fervently. That's good of you, Your Grace. I drink to the good fortunes of the Principality of Immendingen. May it grow, thrive and prosper. Especially grow. You're right, my dear Bellotti. My country had a width of just a few miles, and not much more length. But its height goes up to the stars. # if only the King knew # how brave my sweetheart is Hi! Good morning. # for the King he'd give his blood # but for me as well Babette! The special milk, Mademoiselle, I was going to bring it. You've a pretty voice, Babette, like a silvery bell. But you must learn to prop it up. Here. Like a glass ball on top of a water jet. That's how it must be placed on the breath. # if only the King knew # how brave my sweetheart is # for the King he'd give his blood # but for me as well # but for me as well # my sweetheart has no ribbon, no star # no cross like the noble gentlemen # my sweetheart will never be a general # if only he'd get his discharge # if only he'd get his discharge # three starts shine so brightly # above Mary's Chapel # she ties a pink ribbon for us # and a cross for our home # if only the King knew # how brave my sweetheart is # for the King he'd give his blood # but for me as well # but for me as well # but for me as well When the demoiselle sings so beautifully I must think of my fianc√©. Your fianc√©? Because it's true. He's always away on duty. The Demoiselle cannot understand, but - I can! The Demoiselle feels the same. But one mustn't give up. Certainly not! I want to know what's happening in my country. Do you understand, Herr von Arnegg! Let's take the Bellotti affair. They want to make me believe that she arrived yesterday from Munich, whereas I saw her in town earlier. Not far from here, with my own eyes. And those suggestive remarks she made to me last night. About being in the company of an officer, and the pretty road from here to the border. I'm in deep distress, Your Grace. For more than 20 years I've conducted the affairs of the state and suddenly Your Grace is ... Dissatisfied! That's right. Why did you attend to the Bellotti's reception yesterday like an evil conscience incarnate? I want the Demoiselle to be treated during her stay here with greatest respect! Is it understood? Here are the Cavallieri's files. Maybe we'll find in there some ... - clues? - Don't worry. The authorities were always very well informed about the subjects' private lives. What's this? .. prohibited to grant any inspection of the files ... Have you found something? Yes, indeed. One moment. Could we give information in this case and make an exception? What's the matter? Since it's prohibited, out of the question. So it's prohibited. I see. The high-ranking person doesn't want the affair to be cleared up. I'd like to help you, Mademoiselle, but ... I must know who my father is. You know, the State Minister von Arnegg has ... I'm sorry Mademoiselle, but ... Take this back to the archives. It's strictly prohibited to grant information. Prohibited? Why do you think it's impossible to ascertain the girl's father, Herr von Arnegg? I want you personally to take charge of this affair. - I beg your pardon? - I? - Yes, you. What will the women of Munich think of us if they cannot find their fathers here! You'll search for the father. I demand it. Thus a poet is finally appreciated. Even though a bit late. That would be all. They told me I was to live in the palace. Even though it pains me to leave this room. - Herr Knips, I want to ... - My umbrella! The roof beams are a bit rotten, you know. And it drips when it's raining. - Such an umbrella is a blessing. - Herr Knips ... There's something I must know. - You mentioned a person of high rank. - I did. Could the Minister von Arnegg be my father? Minister von Arnegg? I don't know. But I was told Herr von Arnegg ... But Christine! Why do you want to conjure shadows? What good is it to you when you learn who your father is. You'll find the man whom your mother loved most of all. And whom today you perhaps think you must hate. Because he made her suffer. Christine! Do you want to hate where your mother loved? Veit! Veit! Babette! At last we can kiss undisturbed. The poem! Ten stanzas! Ten stanzas? You must write me as much as I did. Ten? Golly, that'll cost me ... Cost? I mean, cost an effort. The demoiselle! Yes, Babette? The Minister of State von Arnegg is waiting for the Demoiselle inside. Mademoiselle, I've come to ask you a question. If you please ... I'll come to the point. You're searching for your father here, aren't you? I am. I'd like to offer you my assistance. May I know your mother's name? Her name was ... She used to be a singer at this Court Theatre and her name was Angelika Cavallieri. Angelika Cavallieri? She was your mother? - But this is impossible! - You knew her? Indeed I did. I knew it. Then ... Mademoiselle ... you'll understand that certain circumstances force me to ... - I understand. A person of such high rank couldn't ... - He couldn't, couldn't he? I deeply regret that I'm unable to help. It's all right, Herr von Arnegg. - Only ... - Yes? It doesn't matter anyway. I hope you realize that in this case higher regards ... I respect your regards, Herr von Arnegg, even though I might not understand them. Then allow me, Mademoiselle, to take leave. Halt! Quick! Your cap! Is she inside? Yes. Babette says she must come out soon. Come out soon? On her way to the rehearsal. - Good morning, gentlemen. - Good morning, Court Conductor. Good morning, good morning. Good morning. Slept well? That's the main thing. I was awake the whole night. - Really? - Yes, indeed. But I've composed a sweet song, please take my hat and gloves, Kn√ºppelmann. Sweet, really sweet. He'll certainly be pleased, certainly. When there's a full moon I always have trouble sleeping. Here are the notes. And tonight the cheeky fellow shone so obtrusively into my window that I got up, sneaked to the piano and right away I had the melody. Listen to this! If you please, gentlemen! A bit of silence. # a poor shepherd admired the high Queen # and since she refused him he sneaked into her room # he was about to kiss her # then came along Good morning. Everything ready for the rehearsal? I hope we can have our breakfast soon. You see, Artistic Director, I have trouble sleeping when there's a full moon. - Hasn't the Bellotti arrived yet? - And tonight the cheeky fellow shone ... Not yet, Manager. The cheeky fellow shone so obtrusively into my window that I jumped out of my bed and composed a song. Sweet, very sweet. Shall I sing it for you? # a poor shepherd admired the high Queen # and since she refused him he sneaked into her room # he was about to kiss her, there came along ... Excuse me, Artistic Director, if I'm interrupting ... - Can't you hear I'm ... - The score hasn't arrived yet. - What score? - Score, score? Tamara refuses to hand out the soprano score. And she has the only copy with lyrics. Those women! # Comes along a slim young fellow # with blond curls or brunette - I can't let you ... - Come in! Pardon. You've told the messenger that you refuse to hand out the song. You can't be serious, dearest Tamara. Maybe you don't know that you have the only copy with lyrics. - I do. But Madame, I fail to understand why ... I myself will sing tonight at the Court Concert, I'm no longer hoarse. # Comes along a slim young fellow You hear? Very nice but it's not possible. Because of your indisposition we've engaged a replacement, a young singer from Munich. # blue eyes, red cheeks But she doesn't know the song lyrics. # Ey, one may well look at him Ah, there's the score! But Madame, what are you doing? It's burning. The only copy with the lyrics! The entire Court Concert is endangered! It really happened by accident. - Such bad luck! - Madame, how could you! At ease! You! [Du] You*, Herr von Arnegg. [Sie] - Christine! - Let go of me, let go! It mustn't be! But we're ... What are we? We don't suit each other. Walter, it mustn't be. It mustn't be. Christine! I have another song instead. the moon, the cheeky fellow shone so obtrusively into my window tonight, that I couldn't sleep and composed a song, sweet, simply sweet, do you want to listen to it? # a poor shepherd admired the high Queen # and when she refused him he sneaked into her room # he was about to kiss her, there came along ... Just imagine, gentlemen, she's burned the score of the song. How do you mean, she's burned it? She really burned it? Doesn't anybody among you know the song's lyrics? Of course I know the melody, but the lyrics ... - Oh my God! - But I know a way out. - You do? My song that I composed last night ... - # a poor shepherd ... - Stop it! But you've known it for nine years. - I'll try to remember. - You will? I'm relieved. How did it begin? The beginning ... # a young shepherd admired the high ... No, that's the other one. I'll find it. If you manage, my dear, I promise you the princely order, 4th class. Ah, Mlle Bellotti! I'm delighted to welcome you, Mademoiselle. Unfortunately the lyrics of our best song are lost, but we're trying to recover them. We'd like to acquaint you with the melody first, if you please ... - If you please. Concert master, you'll accompany. 3/4 time, larghetto. # do you never think about what may happen # one day you'll forget me # what am I without you? # tell me Tell me, how do you know this song, Mlle Bellotti? I've never heard it performed anywhere else but at His Grace's Court Concert. It was my late mother's favourite song. Was your mother singer at our Court Theatre? Yes, 20 years ago. If you please... If you please ... Allow me ... My dear Vogel, everything in order, can we start soon? Yes, Your Grace. Couldn't you for once say something else, instead of that eternal "Yes, Your Grace"? Yes, Your Grace. Hopeless. We narrowly missed being out of order, Your Grace. - Why? - Tamara has burned the song's lyrics. Fortunately we found out at the last moment that Mlle Bellotti knew the song. From her late mother. From her mother? Who was her mother? The singer Cavallieri, Your Grace. What are you saying! - The singer ... - Yes, Your Grace. Angelika Cavallieri was the mother of ... Your Grace. I'm delighted that you'll sing a few songs for us, my child. Your Grace, I've managed to keep the girl away from researching any further. You managed that splendidly. # do you never think what may happen # one day you'll forget me # and what am I without you # tell me # do you never think what may happen # one day you'll write to me # "Don't wait in front of my door any longer" # maybe tomorrow will arrive your final letter # because every happiness is like a bouquet of roses # every love withers, that's the old eternal song # and what am I when my dream melts away # but today you are still mine # I wish you came through the door right now # No, it was the wind. It kissed the roses and then flees away # and he sings a farewell song # do you never think what may happen # one day you'll forget me # and what am I without you? Tell me # how they faded away # the memories - She sang marvelously. - What do you know about it? You aren't even musical! What do you know about it? You're not even in love. I knew your late mother very well, Mademoiselle. A marvelous woman, a great artist. The song she sang, I heard it from her the last time 20 years ago. I'd like to keep you here in our capital, Mademoiselle. Will you stay with us? - It's impossible, Your Grace. - As Court Singer. Or as the wife of Lieutenant von Arnegg? No, no! It's not possible at all, Your Grace. It's not possible? Why not? But I cannot marry my ... my brother. What makes you think Lieutenant von Arnegg is your brother? Well, Minister von Arnegg said ... One thing I know for sure: Herr von Arnegg isn't your father. He isn't? But they told me, a person of high rank ... and I thought, since Herr von Arnegg... Higher, higher ... Higher. Your Grace! Don't be too angry with him, Christine. With your father. Who can know what were the reasons at the time ... How could I be angry with you? Since she loved him so. Why didn't you tell us earlier that Angelika Cavallieri was your mother? Maybe the father would have been found sooner. Anyway, he has been found now. Yes, he has been found, my child. Where are you going? - Forget it, father. - I thought you were confined to your room? You don't have to lock me up any longer. She doesn't love me anymore. - It was a mistake. - My boy, a mistake? - Yes, a mistake! Thank God, a mistake. So you're living in the capital and never even try to approach your Prince. It wasn't exactly in my power, Mr. Prince. I see, I was the guilty one, Mr. Court Poet. - I beg your pardon? - Court Poet, that's what I said, didn't I, my dear Vogel? Yes, Your Grace. Yes, Mr. Court Poet. A charming couple, aren't they? Your Grace, please consider that we Arneggs can trace our ancestry back to the crusades, - and a common Miss Holm ... - Rest reassured, my dear Arnegg, the girl's father can trace his ancestry back to the time before the crusades. # how beautiful it is to be in love # so don't ask, don't speak, be mine The end Engl. subs: serdar202@KG 2019
