[telephone ringing] [telephone ringing] May I borrow a pen? Stop! Don't! I woke up gasping and dripping in sweat. My left hand was raised in the air. It was frozen. I couldn't put it down. [MAMA SUSAN'S FRIENDS] I remember May. Suddenly, I felt heavy. I lost my appetite. What are you doing? Let's get out of here. Just do that in the library. There's air-condition. [chattering] Manansala! Ma'am, did you find my journal? I didn't see your journal. I tried looking for it twice. Both Louie and I submitted at the same time. That's right. This will be my last warning. If you fail to submit, I will mark you incomplete. I will submit a new one. I'm writing a new entry, but I'm only halfway through. Would that be fine? Sure, but I will only give half a mark. I'm so pissed! I spent the whole semester writing that damn journal. And she would just misplace it? It was one my best works. I even wrote down moments when I drank water. Just write a made up story and submit that. That will shut her up. As easy as that. It's another irrelevant day at school. My friends and I ended up sharing stories... again. I thought you've patched things up with your aunt's family? I just don't want to talk about it. Sometimes I just want to hide away in the mountains. The only reason they took me in, so I could finish high school. And so I could be away from my good-for-nothing father. But I know they're just keeping me from my mother's relatives. But they're still your relatives, right? Not closely related, a half-brother of my father's cousin. She's still asleep at this hour? Americans don't get up from bed before twelve noon! It's 11:00 am. Guys, have you memorized your lines? You might want to join our rehearsal. Our performance is due next week. We're studying you guys. You guys are so great. Good job! We'll come in after this scene. Thank you! Good job! Just go on and finish the scene. Then what happened? If it wasn't for the storm that destroyed San Ildefonso National High school, or if only there was another high school, even on top of a mountain I would've went there. I was only five years old when I got into second grade. My grandmother held some power in that school. And I always got the highest grades. But didn't you mention your grandmother was part of a rebel group? That's what my father said. But they weren't that close. My grandma didn't like my father. Even when I was a child, I never saw them talking to each other. So who's sending you to school? My father just sends me money. But I doubt that the money really comes from him. I suspect my uncle is behind it. Or probably my Grandma. I don't know. All I know is I'm in school. Galo, you're the playwright. We need you. Can you please cooperate with us? You're screwed! Let's go back to our topic. Where is your father? He has another family. Actually, I have no news of him. When the money stops coming, then I will have to stop school. That's how it is. Let's join them. Galo! Are you happy with what you did to my friend? Dude, what was that about? Galo! - Galo! - Yes? Get down, hurry! I need you to do something. Coming! Go to the store and buy tomato sauce. I need to make spaghetti for Julius' class. Hurry up. Okay. Go ahead. There. Hey! Get the drill from Boy's house. Tell him I'll return it later. Okay. Sheryl used your bike. Son of a... What will you need that for? Don't use that, his place is just nearby. The front tire's busted. That's because you don't keep it away properly! Have it fixed! Eat up. Finish all of it. Galo, have you bought the sauce? I'm on my way out. What's the matter with you? I thought you have it already. Hurry! I need it right away! Yes, yes. I had another nightmare. I was walking alone. Suddenly, there was a woman. She held me at the back. I stopped. She kept on walking, I stared at her until she slowly vanished. Galo. Wake up. It's already noon. Clean Clinton's cage. It's starting to stink. It's my birthday today. Nobody at home remembered. So I'll ended up drinking with my friends. You guys are pigs. Let me remind you, Galo's birthday is not a food fest. We are here to get drunk. There's plenty of food in Jovit's fridge. Chill, man. You act like it's your house. By the way, Jovit... is your Dad at the casino again? Where else? How should I know? Galo looks problematic. He can only afford one case of beer for us. Dude, are you still heartbroken? No. I'm just imagining that we haven't broken up yet. But the truth is catching up on me. Maybe you got her pregnant and she could not accept that you're the father. So that's why she ran away. Is that based on your own experience? Punk! Dude, she's just a girl. Why worry if you're not going to marry her? Dude, please keep away from Andrea. You know she's the only cure to my bleeding heart. When it comes to Andrea, may the best man win. Damn, who wouldn't want to be her boyfriend, right? I'm serious, dude! I'm serious too, dude. But you're lucky I'm more serious with Professor Toreza. If she fails you, you're really going to cry over it. Does anyone even fail in Theology? No one! Right? No one! She might as well say, if you don't join the outreach program you'll go straight to hell. Guilt trip! I don't even know where I'll end up right now. How much more after death? If only my mother listened to my Grandma, I would be taking up medicine. And I wouldn't end up being friends with you. Damn! Hey, he's also insulting you. Hey, he's also insulting you. They're also lucky to have you, punk! That's your birthday gift. I think your mother is making her presence felt. I'll just get some candles. Hurry up. Grab me another beer. Me, too. I need a second round. Grab us all beers, will you? Bro, let me tell you a story. What's that bro? This was told by my father, long ago. He went out for drinks with friends until past midnight. When he came home... he went in through the back so he could have a cup of coffee at the kitchen and so he could avoid being scolded by Grandma. But he had to take a leak outside. While he was taking a leak... While he was taking a leak, he saw something among the trees. An old woman with a dark face staring at him. - Who was that? - He thought he was just imagining things. But he quickly sobered up when a coffin floated by in front of him. You're crazy! He was serious when he told me this story. But my mother was laughing the whole time. Dude, listen up. Our pastor said that paranormal entities aren't always demonic. Sometimes, human acts are even more demonic. Okay? Not those "spirits" which we have to debate whether real or not. But his father won't let him watch horror movies. Do you believe in psychics? Don't you guys do exorcism? Just the same, you use demons for your own motives. That's not what I mean. How about you, Galo? Do you believe in the devil? My nightmares of the black woman are getting more frequent. And they're getting worse. Last night was the scariest. In my dream, she was holding me by the neck. And I was floating mid-air. My hands and feet were gnarled. Stiff as a board. I can't move them. She was also the woman in my other dreams. She still looked the same. I could only see up to her chest. She was black all over. Her skin dark as coal. In my dream, I was frozen and my neck bent. I was shouting for help but nothing was coming out of my mouth. When I woke up, I was crying. Drooling. My back was drenched in sweat. Even now, when I close my eyes, I can still see her. Clearly. Don't! Who said that? Can you light this up? Who said, "No"? Who said that? I didn't recognize the voice! Dude, what's the matter with you? - Don't be stupid. - Who said that? Sometimes, a lot of stuff start to pile up. Damn Louie. You're the only one in class, - who won't stop obsessing over that project. - Here's the contribution. - For our trip: Five pesos per day. - I just got used to it. Inclusive of the fare, accommodation, entrance fee, and food. The problem is, Rowena backed out from collecting funds. So who can volunteer to be the next treasurer? Don't look at me. Louie, take it. Me? You want to take it? Take this seriously, so we can all go home. Galo will collect the funds daily. [applause] What just happened? Look at the board. [TV reporter talking] [telephone ringing] [telephone ringing] [telephone ringing] [telephone ringing] Hello? Hello? May I speak with Dindo? Who's calling? Who's on the phone? She's looking for Uncle Dindo. Who's calling this late at night? Everyone's already asleep. Who's this? [telephone hangs up] She hung up. It was a woman, wasn't it? What's going on? Why? Go to bed. You might not notice, Jenny is starting to become a woman. Julius is almost a teenager. He should have his own bed. Dindo, are you listening to me? What do you want me to do with him? At least, he helps around the house. You consider him more than your own children? Why don't you send him to his father's hometown? Let's go. The boys are just one phone call away. Where are we going to drink? Here? Might as well burn down this house. Why didn't you go to Baguio with them? I can't. No one's going to feed the dog. And do I really want to be with them? No way! Brother, we have to go. Who was that? My sister. She's getting on my nerves. I'll call you back. We're having dinner at my grandpa's house. I don't want to go with them. Why don't you join them? They're your family. I don't feel like it. Dude, don't kill yourself, okay? Just call me if you can't take it anymore. You're the one who keeps calling me. And why would I commit suicide? It's not that often I get the house all to myself. Okay, okay. And we have cable and VCD's I haven't watched yet. Okay, I've got to go. All right, take care. [TV sound] [telephone ringing] [telephone ringing] Hello? I forgot to mention. Bernard wanted you to call him. He's asking how much you've collected for the funds. That's not urgent. That can wait until Monday. Whatever you say. Okay, bye. Pesky! What now? Don't! I'm not sure of what I heard. But it kept me awake. Don't raise your voice at me! I'm not raising my voice at you! I'm just trying to help you out. It's not as if I wanted to lose my phone. Then where did it go? You're always on your phone. Did someone steal it? Your father bought that for you. It's expensive! I can't find it! Don't tell me someone broke into our house without us knowing. It's just us here. I'm not pointing fingers. You're such a scatterbrain! Have you asked Sheryl? I saw her using the phone. She hasn't woken up yet. And where would she take it? This is making my blood boil! We live in one house. Why will we steal from one another? Who do you listen to? And what do you follow? Is it carnal lust? Casual sex? This is what Hollywood teaches the youth. Marriage before sex has become an outdated concept. Just as sex is a holy union, and that sex is for procreation. Exclusive relationship has now... become optional after... an "encounter". We dismiss the sacred role of procreation. And we defile it for our own pleasure. And where does this lead to? Abortion. Why? All of this, is because of lust. I wanted to buy something from the canteen. Hey, look! It's Jovit and Andrea. Let it go. It was Uncle Dindo's flight yesterday. He's a cook in a ship, just like my father. But he's not in good terms with Aunt Auring. And I'm caught up in their fight as well. [telephone ringing] Hello? Hello? Did you get a phone call for me there? I don't know. No one by the name of Nancy called? None. Is your Aunt Auring there? Yes. Listen up, Galo. You don't know anything, okay? Don't tell her I called. Your uncle should be on the plane by now. Who called? Was it for him? Was it a woman? No. Wrong number. Next time someone calls and asks for him, give me the phone. I will talk to her myself. Okay. Good afternoon, sir. Gilberto Manansala? Yes, sir. Sit down. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Do you know John Louie Marquez? Yes, sir. He's my friend and classmate. Was he in your class today? He was absent, sir. Do you know why? No idea, sir. Because he's in the hospital right now. According to our guard that came to his rescue, he was beaten up by a group of young men. Your age. Just outside the gate of this institution. Did you know anything about this? No, sir. The street vendors said the assailants asked John Louie if he was Galo before they started beating him up. This piece of information led us to his close friend which according to our sources, is you, Mr. Manansala. So I ask you again, Do you know anything about this? I really have no idea, sir. Do you have any enemies? Do they have any reason to stake you outside and mistake another student for you? You better start talking, young man! Mr. and Mrs. Marquez will most definitely want to see you. And will probably bring in the cops to have some of our students questioned. Sheryl, what are you doing?! Wait! Come on! How many times did I tell you not to get stuff that doesn't belong to you. This is the last time you'll be using any of my stuff! Wait! What's your problem? I was just borrowing it. Who did you borrow it from? You're not even using it. You selfish prick! I will get it again when you're away. Don't you dare! - Galo. What's up? - Mister Carding! You might be interested. Is this new? Yes. I'm starting to suspect you. This might be illegal. No, sir. I'm just a working student. I'm not that kind of person. It's late. Really really late. Are doing some kind of vice? I was just caught up in schoolwork. Liar! You're no different from your uncle! It's our anniversary today and that jerk didn't even call me. He's too preoccupied with his mistress! What's her name again? Nancy? I'll go upstairs. Hold up. A telegram came for you. Your father's dead. Condolence. You worthless piece of crap! Just be patient. It will be finished. How long should we wait? [arguing continues] Let's look for a store to buy snacks. Yes, that would take long anyway. [woman crying] [bus honk] Wait up! Wait up! We're coming! Hurry! [women shouting] It doesn't bite. [Prayer in Latin] There's no one Joselito hasn't cured. Welcome back, dear. Grandma! Bless me. Let us have supper inside. Okay. I'll probably continue my studies when I get a job. For what? What do you mean? You will finish your studies because that is the custom. You will find work because that is what everybody is doing. But tell me, for what purpose? What time will the electricity come back on today? Why? Are you afraid of the dark? No way. We already had electricity here before, right? Grandma... about father... ...I would like to visit him. One of these days, let's go together. Thank you. Who's there? I couldn't sleep again last night. The sound of the crickets is different. It's creepy. As if they're trying to whisper something. [Latin prayer] Here, Galo. These blocks of wood are enough to last you until next week. Thank you. Fine. Just let me know if you need anything. Okay. All right. Thanks again. Galo, you're all grown up now! - Let me help you. - Don't bother. I'll bring this to the kitchen so I can start preparing lunch. We shouldn't let grace wait on us. Or they will lose all the nutrients. Just go back to what you're doing. Galo! I brought something from my catch. I'll go ask Grandma if she wants it. Oh, I'm not selling this. You don't recognize me, do you? We know each other. I woke up in the middle of the night from scratches at my door. It wanted to get in. It startled me. Very weird. I've only been here for a week. But it feels like it's been a month. I barely get to see Grandma. It's as if she lives in another world. Grandma, I brought your food. Grandma... when will we visit father? Soon. Okay. She's always by herself. She's either knitting or sewing new clothes for her religious statues. She barely talks to me. Whenever I ask how she is, she always says she's fine. One short answer for every question I ask. How's your day, Grandma? Grandma. I'll just go out. It seems she's not her usual self. So I just keep to myself. I woke up at three in the morning. I heard noises. [Latin chant] It's Galo. Excuse me. Mama! Mama! Darn it! Who are you? Why are you sleeping here? And why are you here? My name is Galo. Big brother Galo. What are your names? Do you want more of that? We have more inside the house. I can give you some. These are all for you. This one's for you. But first, what's my name again? Galo. Big brother Galo. What's your name? Jezel. Jessa? Jezel. Jezel. She's your sister? What's your name? Niko. Niko. Niko and Jezel. Do you live here with Grandma? How old are you, Jezel? She's five. I'm nine. Why are you living at the hovel? Why don't you stay here inside the house? And how come this is the first time I saw you two? Come inside. What's the matter? Where's your mother? And what's her name? Tinay. Tinay? Your Tinay's children? She used to work for us. Niko. I remember you now. Your mother used to bring you here. But you were still so little. Where is she now? Dead. What? She drowned at sea. Her boat capsized. When did that happen? And who's taking care of you? Who's taking care of you now? I let them breathe fresh air. Let the sun kiss their skin. Feel the grass, soil, and sand on their feet. They told me they're always outside. This is important for the health of children. And helps them socialize with others. But sometimes it becomes too much. They forget to come back home. But... I am sure that it will not happen again. I offered to let them sleep in my bedroom. They have their own room. By the way,... about Tinay- Have you finally adjusted here since your return? I'm good. I get up on time even though the alarm clock is broken. The rooster crows in the morning. The lizard... kisses the ground at dusk. You do not need clocks here to tell time, which are given to us in ample amount. By the way grandma, I only saw three copies of Reader's Digest in my room. And the changes here- Nothing is more important than spiritual health. More than anything else. This is really delicious. We do not use any chemical or pesticide. We only use animal droppings as fertilizer. The rich ground gives rise to the bloom of plants. And the plants give sustenance to the animals. If there was balance in our food system, we wouldn't need wide acres of land for animal farming. And we would not have to give animals strong and harmful chemicals. People would be able to avoid a host of diseases. And swatches of land would allow farmers to grow nutritious fruits and vegetables. Is that what you were studying in Manila? People can live without those things. How long before a thing like that goes out of demand? People ceaselessly consume electricity. They use electricity every chance they get. Men live on a system that gathers the earth's richness continuously to turn them into trash and poison. Man is a fool to think that he is the king of the universe, assuming that he can make the universe serve him, instead of the other way around. There will come a time when there will only be two seasons. Season of drought... and season of floods. Diseases will arrive, for which we will have no cure. They will spread like wildfire, infecting everyone, and no medicine to stop them. People will become destitute and go hungry. This will cause grave misunderstanding among different nations. And this will eventually lead to a horrifying world war. It will be a horrifying time when the living will envy the dead. Stop crying. Galo, do you hear that? - What is it? - Sound coming from the future. The cries of newly born babies. The coming generation is wailing... begging... crying out for help! Despite all of the things happening, it's a good thing that I have company. Got you! It takes my mind off of them. We even get to play. Why are you running away? It's been a long time since I did this. I guess this is much better. - Faster. - I give up. I'm beat. You made me exhausted. I'm now drenched in sweat. Me too. Don't let sweat dry off your skin. Grandma might scold you. She's not our grandmother. By the way, Were you playing at the back of the house the other day? By the clothesline? My laundry fell to the ground. They were also spat on. That wasn't you? Do you see the people coming to the house at night? Do you see what they're doing? Are they Catholics? Do know what Catholicism is? - Catholicism is- - Mother said Mama Susan is a witch. She kills people. Niko! Do you know my father? Do you know where he's buried? Are you sure this is the spot? This one looks really old. Your father has been dead for a very long time. I got more confused because of what I discovered. And I'm becoming more afraid. [Latin chant] [Latin chant] March 19, 1999. I was about to write a letter for Andrea, Just to greet her on her birthday. But I didn't know what came to me, and I decided to read Grandma's libretto. Jezel? Grandma? Jezel? I told you to come to me when you're hungry. Niko went to school. You can tell me if your brother's at school. Have you been upstairs? Yeah. Do you want to go upstairs? No, I meant the room. What room? My brother said there's something for you there. What do you mean? He will get it for you. I don't get it. What is it? Big brother. Is this name yours? Come here. Before I got here, you weren't staying at the house. Why? Jezel doesn't want to. She said Mama Susan's friends hate us. Who are these friends? She said, they're here right now. Here? Where? There! Niko! Jezel! Jezel! Hurry! Niko! Open this up! Don't be scared, I'm right here. Niko! Jezel! Grandma has been burning with fever for two days now. She hasn't eaten anything. I don't know what to do. Grandma, do you want something to eat? Your soup's getting cold. Just eat a few spoonful. Grandma? You can leave us. Miss Delia? Grandma's burning with fever. She hasn't eaten since last night. You can leave us. Oh, boil me some water. The water you asked for is ready. How about you? Do you want to learn the "knowledge" from Orning? Not now. I don't know. But as much as possible, I don't want to be part of what they're doing. I'm getting really scared, especially with grandma. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, happy birthday. Happy birthday to you! Galo! Come over here. We just started eating. I cooked. It is delightful to have a sip of warm soup. Let's eat. Mama, Galo is asking if you're Catholic. Have you seen me wearing any other frock in the prayer room? Have you seen me pray only when desired? The Iglesia Santissima of the Holy Order of the World is only for those who deserve it. You're right. She's not evil. Niko, cut it out. Evil? Who is evil? What is evil? Isn't it that the evil we know is because of absence of love? Mama? Jezel. Do you kill people? Are you a witch? Jezel. I am not a witch. I do not kill people. That's not what she meant- People are the ones killing themselves because of the way of life that they chose to live. Just eat up. Stop asking these questions. Where's my pen? Grandma! Your mother Melissa worked as a helper in the Middle East. She only went back once to spend vacation here for a month. But right from the start, she kept bickering with her husband, your father Glen. Due to an unfortunate incident, Melissa was imprisoned in the Middle East. With the lack of compassion from authorities, we did not hear from her again. She was meted out with a punishment. She was beheaded. You do not know the truth because no one told you. Your good-for-nothing father remarried. And he brought his new wife to your family's house. They made love right in front of you without any respect of your presence. Before you graduated from elementary school, he left you to my care. I cared for you... and loved you. I took you in like my own family. But as repayment,... you chose to leave me behind. Because you are a scoundrel, just like your father! Grandma. Melissa did not come from my womb. You will not call me Grandma. From now on, the one standing in front of you is Mama Susan. Shit! Niko! Jezel! Niko! Jezel! Niko! Niko, didn't I tell you to start cooking rice? We're right here! What happened? Grandma? I'll take it from here. Grab me more wet cloths. Okay. Let's go! Hurry up! Nothing... you've ever... been... Niko, Jezel, you can do that again tomorrow. You don't want to damage your eyes. You don't write anymore? What do you mean? I always see you writing on your journal. I lost my pen. Did you see it? No. How about you? Forget it. I'll write again when I find my pen. I have sharp memory anyway. What do you write about? Whatever's on my mind. Go ahead, you can go downstairs. I'll keep Grandma company- I mean, Mama Susan. Go straight to bed. Mama Susan? The end is nigh. The first angel will blow his trumpet. It will rain ice and fire of blood! One-third of the land will be on fire! As well as the trees and the grasslands! Hey! Hey! Get some rest in your room! You don't want to get sick. We will take care of Mama Susan. Here. What is this for? So you can start writing your stories again. Thank you. You won't use this anymore? I have a spare. And we don't write anymore at school. So what do you do there? Nothing. We already know how to write, read, and count. So that's it? You'll stop learning? That's right. Is there a new school here? Where is that? At Auntie Rosa's. Jezel and I have been looking for you. What are you doing out here? What are you thinking? I'm staying at my relatives' house in Manila. I live with my cousins. Ariel and Jeng are constantly bickering. There's Sheryl, who always breaks my favorite things. And Julius who is as big and impish as you! In Manila, when the light goes out, even for an hour, we all panic. Our world comes to a screeching halt. It's as if the world is pointless if there's no electricity. You know. I'm starting to like this place where I was born. The moon and stars shine brighter here. And the fireflies. By the big tree? - By the river? - That's right! They're so beautiful. Feels like Christmas all the time. You know what Christmas is, right? I love watching the fireflies by the trees. Someday, when I have my own family, we will live in a place like this. I like living here. But Niko... ...I want to see my friends again. I want to see the city again. My cousins, especially Julius. I'm tired of this place. And... Are you starting to get scared? Me too. But I know you won't abandon me and Jezel. [Latin chant] Galo! [Latin chant] Joselito. [Latin chant] [Latin chant] [people murmuring] [men chatting] Galo! I thought you weren't coming back. I saw you passing by here the other day. But you left right away. Who are you? People call me Narcing. I used to be part of the town's council. Now, I take care of this church. How do you know me? And how come the people here know me? San Ildefonso is a small town. What happened here? You want to know? You might notice that this is an abandoned church. The Catholic Church has turned their back on us. They claim we defy the teachings of Christianity. That's why the Holy Order has shepherded its own people. You barely remember it. It was a long time ago. And your parents weren't really that religious. The townspeople shunned technology and development. We didn't listen to the authorities. And the authorities got scared of this town. They sabotaged the town's institution. And the businessmen fled. The government decided to leave us alone. We are not obliged to pay any taxes. And we don't accept any help from the government. You turned your back from the civilization? The civilization that conforms with greed. The Holy Order believes that true change lies in the heart. A blessing from God. Do you know what happened to Grandma? An epidemic broke out here. Many people died. Your house was turned into a funeral site. Madame Josefina, or Mama Susan, allowed it because she has no family. To counter bad luck, she collected religious images. The people grew fond of these religious images. So they started giving her some more. We had a little bit of misunderstanding- Galo! Galo! Niko! Jezel! You're it! Catch! You're it! You're it! Catch! You're it! Galo! You're leaving us? - Let's get out of here! - Galo. I can't leave Jezel behind. Where is she? Upstairs! In our room! I'll go get her! Okay. Hold this! - Jezel, Jezel! - Huh? We're leaving. Niko is downstairs Wait! My slippers! - Leave it! - Wait! My slippers! I need my slippers! Where are they? There! There! Niko! Niko! Put on your slippers. - Galo - Niko! He might be in the toilet. He needed to pee. Let's go! Niko! Niko! I'm here! Let's go! Where are we going? We're getting out of this island! Let's pass through there! - Where? - Follow me! Where? Follow me! Niko, don't! Galo? Someone's coming for us! Keep quiet! Where are you going, Galo? Do you need me to take you across to the other island? No one crosses the sea in this weather! Let's go back home! Mama Susan is still asleep! She doesn't know anything! Galo! Let's go back! She's getting worse. Holy spirit of the trees, guide these hands. Have mercy. Easy, easy! Galo, look what I've found! Where did you find this? At the temple, behind the altar. They have lots of it back there, but some have rotted. Nice, thanks. Wait. Did this come from the sick people they've cured? They're all dead. I need to pee. Jezel, they won't come for us anymore. You can go to the toilet by yourself. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Go ahead. Galo. Yeah? Jezel is scared because... What? She sees something. Remember your laundry that fell on the dirt? Jezel knows who did it. She says they are Mama Susan's friends. Jezel sees a lot of things we can't see. Don't tell Mama Susan. That's what mother always told us before we went to sleep. Mama? This is the first time she moved again in days! The lady of the realm is possessing her. Niko! Jezel! Wait for me downstairs. Hurry! [Latin prayer] Galo? [Latin prayer] Mama Susan? Do you now hear my friends? No, Mama Susan. Confess it, Galo! They said you stole your class funds! You stole from your family and friends! I'm starting to suspect you. This might be stolen. Grandma! You worship no one but yourself! You good-for-nothing boy! You had aborted the baby of the woman you impregnated! Mama Susan. Son of a bitch! There, there. Don't be scared. [Latin prayer] Stop crying. Don't be scared. [Latin prayer] Why are there flowers for the dead upstairs? Is Mama Susan dead? If Mama Susan were dead, then what would she still be doing on this plane? So what, then, is possessing her? Holy. Niko! - Niko! - He's sick. What? He's burning up. This can't be. We need to leave. Did you see my wallet? My wallet's missing. I have no money. Someone took my shoes so I can't leave. And they made sure I have no means to get out. Drink up, Niko. He's getting worse. Yes. He needs to drink his medicine. It's my fault. I shouldn't have dragged you with me in the storm. I just took my medicine earlier. This is the last one. I only brought two, so you need to recover after this. I feel chilly. Get some rest. You need to sweat it out. Are we going to play? [Latin prayer] Stay here. [Latin prayer] The dead body is here again. Close the door! Don't look at them! [Latin prayer] Jezel? Do you know what happened to my father? Mama Susan is angry with him. Still angry? Do you see him? Not anymore. He doesn't want you here. Don't! They're gone. Didn't you say not to open the door? Jezel! Jezel! Let's get out of here tomorrow. As soon as Niko recovers, we'll leave by tomorrow. They cannot stop us anymore. Why are we watching over her? So no one can come near her? Yes. So she can't come for us. Huh? Don't scare me! My brother hasn't come back yet. They took him to the hospital. Why didn't you wake me? Why did they take Niko, not Mama Susan? Jezel, it's getting dark. Wash up and get back inside. Okay. They haven't come back. Let's play a game of riddles. Do you remember the game your brother and I often play? Do you remember the answers? Here's a riddle. Here comes Kaka, his legs opening and closing. A pair of scissors. Another one. Tarzan swings and cracks the road open. Zi... Zipper. Remember the answer. Another one. Pedro hides, with his head sticking out. Nail. Nail, that's the answer. Last one. Two round, black circles travel very far. Pair of eyes. She's dead. Let's leave. How about your brother? Jezel. Let's stay here for now. I'd rather watch over Grandma. The hungry wolf fell into a huge pot of boiling water. The three little pigs were saved. They rejoiced because no one's going to eat them anymore. No one's going to destroy their houses. The end. Another one. Please! I've run out of stories. Aren't you tired of them? [Latin prayer] The second angel will blow his trumpet. A large, burning mountain will throw itself to the sea. One third of the ocean will turn into blood. One third of all the creatures living therein will die. One third of all the sea vessels will be destroyed. The third angel will blow his trumpet. And a big star will fall burning... to one thirds of the rivers and streams. Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come, as it is in Heaven. - What are you blabbering? - Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who sin against us. - Are you praying? - and lead us not into temptation... ...but deliver us from evil. Amen. Hail Mary- One third of the waters will turn to poison, and all who would drink it will die. Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name... Give us this day our daily bread, forgive us our sins - as we forgive those who sinned- - The dark men are here! They're coming for us! Hurry up, Galo! - Let's get out of here! - The fourth angel will blow his trumpet. Run, Jezel! Faster Galo! Jezel! - Faster Galo! Faster! - I can't run anymore. Let's go to the hovel. Let's hide there. Careful. Careful. Close the door. Careful. Galo. Let's stay here. They won't find us here. Get some rest. Get some rest. Let's stay here. Go to sleep. Jezel? Jezel? Jezel? Jezel? Jezel? [Latin chant]
