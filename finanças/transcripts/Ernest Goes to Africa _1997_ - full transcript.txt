[waves crashing] [music playing] [snorts] [laughs] [laughs] Hmm. Hmm. BOTH: Ah! [non-english singing] [non-english speech] [music playing] Come on, man, come on! Give me the bag and grab hold! We made it, mate. Who said, we, mate? Ah! Thompson! Thompson! [non-english yelling] Ernest! Yes, sir, I'm coming. WOMAN: Can't you just lift the steering wheel up? IT'S at the wrong angle. You said you could fix it. Yes, ma'am. See, this link's got to move. See, your camrack is connected to your bandtrap. And that makes likes the pressure in your gallywasher. Of course, women seldom understand stuff like this. What was that? What was that? Did you break something? I paid a lot of money for this car. You better not have broken anything. Oh, no, ma'am. These cars got a lot of stuff you don't even need. I knew it! You broke something. You broke my new car! I want to see the owner of this gas station. Yeah, this oughta do it. Well, at least I got rid of that excess pressure. [music playing] ERNEST: Whoah! Oh! Oh! Hmm? Excuse me, sir. Your man out there, I brought my red Mustang in for him to lift the steering wheel. He's breaking pieces off of it. [grunts] Ahh! [grunting] [sighs] Are you gonna come out there and sort it out? - Of course. - Great. I-- I-- That was a close one. Ernest, what's going on out here? Ugh, not only is he trying to-- to ruin my car, he's also trying to a steal my pocketbook! Look, there's my purse in his toolbox! Ernest, get down from there right now. Let go of that. Ahh! Ahh! [SOUNDS OF METAL AND GLASS BREAKING] My car! My beautiful, beautiful car. No, no, no, just calm down, lady, calm down. He'll pay for this, you'll see. Ernest, you get out of this car this instant. Yes, sir. Ernest, you're fired. [music playing] Here you are, gentlemen. Here are your eggs. Can I get you some more coffee? Hey, what gives here? I ordered over-easy and runny. - Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I just got confused. Well, get unconfused, how about it? All righty. Be right back. Excuse me. What's bugging you, Rene? It's not like you to make a mistake, much less take a load of crap off a creep like him. Well, I guess it's my dull miserable life. Well, it's no need to sugarcoat it. [sighs] I tell you Betty, if my Mr. Right came into my life right now, all this would change. He'd be brave and daring, and he'd take me on some dangerous mission laced with international intrigue. And I'd get all caught up in an adventure that would perpetually pump up the adrenaline and peel back the eyelids with fright. Wouldn't that be neat? You-- you've been reading too many romance novels. And then he'd save me from the clutches of some horrible death, and we ride off into the sunset arm in arm, just he and I. Oh, oh! Send shivers down my spine! [giggles] Speaking of shivers, look who's here? Hey girls! How you doing? It's me! I'm here! Doesn't that guy ever give up? Ah, give him a break. He's got such a crush on you. Super. It's all I need, some nerd like Ernest. Just another small town guy stuck in the same rut I'm in. Hey, look. Check it out! I call it the apricot smash. [squeaking] Well, how about you, ladies? Want a breath mint? Ernest aren't you supposed to be at work at the gas station? Nah, I quit that crummy job. I told Mr. Ellis that my talents were being wasted pumping self-serve-- that I had aspired to loftier visions of career. You got fired. Well, we had a pleasant parting. But now I'm free to pursue my real ambitions. Which is what? Ernest, I got a customer. I gotta go. She's got you by the short hair, don't she? Yeah, well, maybe. But I haven't turned on the old Worrel charm yet, know what I mean? Unfortunately, I do. Let me give you a little advice. See, Rene is really down right now. Short of Illinois Smith, I think a little gift might help. But what about the old Worrel charm? Maybe two little gifts? Yeah, two gifts. [music playing] Hey, don't touch. WOMAN: Get out. MAN Don't come near my stall. BOTH: What's that? - Hey! Ow! Hmm? [bird squawks] Oh! [glass shattering] Huh? [baby bird chirping] Can I help you, sir? Oh, yeah. I was just, uh, looking for something for my girl. You like that item, sir? Yeah, I'm, uh, kind of stuck on it. Most people are. It's a very popular item. That would be $40. $40? For this little birdhouse? You don't like it, you can put it back. No, I'm taking it all right. In fact, I'm-- I'm kind of attached to it. $40? $40. There you go. [MUSIC PLAYING WOMAN: Oh! MAN: Watch out! WOMAN: Oh! What are you doing? MAN: Hey, watch it! There's a mad man. WOMAN: Hey, don't you mess with me, boy! Excuse me! [grunts] Whoah! [crowd mumbling] Ah! Ah! Ah! What you want, I do not take! - Okay, where are they? - Where are what? I know nothing. Ah! Give us the eyes of Egoli or we'll pick through your body to find them with a pair of pliers. Ooh, what the eyes of Egoli? I know nothing about this. Ah! Ah! Abdul Kazim has instructed us to bring him the eyes of Egoli or the eyes of the thief. Maybe Abdul Kazim should pluck his own eyes out, since he stole the eyes of Egoli to start with. Oh, don't mind us, please continue. I find this sport rather amusing. Thank you, Bazoo. Really balletic. Oh, thank you, thank you, sir. You have saved my unworthy skin. I never dreamed I would be rescued. You are so right. I'm the man of your dreams. Ooh, this is some really neat stuff. Yeah. I can work with these. We have taken over your planet. [snoring] You looking for the man in the funny hat? He went that way officer. Uh oh. Hey, you, stop! Uh oh. Ahh! Ahh! Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Rabaz, I didn't realize that you weren't fond of our caped necked friend. What? Are you a crazy man? Oh no. Just an animal lover, tree hugger, you know, conservationist. I believe that things should be natural and left the way that they were. What are you talking about? A limo's not a natural habitat for a cobra! Correct, Mr. Rabaz. But weasels and other disgusting rodents are fine fair for this slick young beauty. What is it you want? I tell you anything you want to know. Are you working for Abdul Kazim? No, no, no, no, no, no. No. No longer. My friend is impatient. [snake hisses] You-- Kazim is bound to kill me. Where have you hidden the eyes of Egoli, Mr Rabaz? I know you, Thompson. You are the one who stole the eyes of Egoli from the Sinkatutu tribe. You are the one who betrayed the people. Kazim had you steal the eyes from me, and then you double-crossed Kazim. So the trail ends with you. And I feel very sorry for you. Because you will shortly be feeling the poison of this cobra trickling through your veins. No, wait, please. It is in the flea market in a second hand toy stall in a can marked, two for $1.00. Oh, please, let me go. Thank you, Mr. Rabaz. I'll be right back. I need the catch stick. I, too, am not very fond of handling these things. Ahh! Come on, Bazoo, let's go shopping. [music playing] That's it. Oh! Ah! Oh. [grunts] [humming] Ow! Ta-da! Yeah, she's gonna love this. Oh, yeah. [snoring] Ah! You give me the eyes of Egoli, or Bazoo, here, will cram his foot down the entire length of yourself esophagus. Shoot! I don't know what you're talking about. Looks like the old man's just a decoy. The real agent's this guy. Hey Jake, you want to see something cool? It's my inside loop-d-loop. (ECHO EFFECT) A hush falls over the crowd as the world champion yo-yo expert enters the competition arena really. [drum roll] [cymbal crash] [applause] Rock the cradle. The crowd goes wild! Yay! And now our champion will demonstrate his world of famous triple around the world. One, two, three-- [crash] Oh! Jake! Jake! Jake-- Jake, I'm sorry, Jake, it was an accident! Here, I'll get you some water. Water. Yeah, water. Jake-- Jake, I can't see. Are you in there? It's too dark. Here, I'll cut on the light. [garbage disposal buzz] Speak to me, Jake. Speak to me. Maybe this is quiet time. [music playing] Sir Thompson believes this guy to be agent 32. Yes, he's a dangerous man. And is Thompson sure he's got the eyes of Egoli? Nkulu is never wrong. Here he comes. [whistles] Hey, Ernest! Hi, Betty. I brought that gift. Rene! Oh, Rene. Hold the onions on that burger, Joe. Yes, Ernest? I-- I made something for you. See, I've always kind of thought you were really-- For me? Yeah It's the handoff. She must be his contact. Ernest, this is so sweet of you. I'm sorry I was kind of fussy with you before. Well, opened it up. A yo-yo. Yeah. I made it myself. I'm pretty good with my hands. Unique. Rene, I-- I was kind of wondering, maybe, if you and I-- maybe one afternoon-- Ernest, I really appreciate this gift and all, but I just don't think you and I could ever be. I need someone who can add thrills and adventure to my life. I don't mean to be cruel, Ernest, but you're just a small town ordinary schmo. Just like me. We're both just ordinary schmoes. I don't have to be a small town ordinary schmo or-- I could change. I'll always treasure your gift, always. In fact, I have a whole shelf of schmo knickknacks at home. Yeah, me too. Oh, I should schmo-- go. Gee, I'm sorry, Ernest. I-- I mean I thought she-- you know-- No, she's right. I am just a small town ordinary schmo. I don't have an adventurous bone in my whole body. When we were kids and went trick or treating, I never went more than two houses away. I guess I'm just doomed to a life of ordinary-ness-ness. [music playing] Oh, chosen one. May ashes be heaped on my unworthy head. The news from America is without pleasure. [shrieks] Are you goons hard of hearing, or what? Ernest, or agent 32 as you like to call him, never gave me any eo- golly eyes, or whatever. All I've got is that dumb old yo-yo, and if you and pool-ball over there had half a brain in your heads-- Bazoo. Bazoo? Didn't you hear him, hon? I think he said it twice for emphasis. It's come to our attention, Miss Loomis, that you are an agent for Kazim. [laughs] Right, me, Rene Loomis, a secret agent. Your Cheerios must be soggy, pal. [engine starts] Uh oh. Oh! Where are the eyes of Egoli? Ernest is the one with your eyes. I don't know anything about them. And you can pull my arms out of their sockets. It's not gonna get you Ernest. Okay, Miss Loomis. We'll do just that. [knuckles cracking] Oh! You really need to brush your teeth, fella. [phone rings] Hello? Mr. Worrel. I've someone who wants to chat to you. How did Aunt Ruthie get my new number? The doctors aren't supposed to let her use the phone. Yeah? - Earnest? Rene. Rene? Guess what? These men have me hanging from a forklift, and they're going to torture me all because you have their silly old eyes or something. Now give them back their eyes this minute, Ernest. I'm tired, I haven't had a bath, and it's all your fault. Oh, sure, Rene. You stay right there and I'll bring their eyes right to them. Is your refrigerator running? Agent 32, this is a fair warning. If we don't see you walk through the door of hangar six on Jenson street in 20 minutes, your friend here will be two feet taller. Two feet taller? Oh, she'll never be able to wear that blue dress again. I'm sure he'll be right over. You know he probably got your googly eyes by mistake. He tends to make mistakes. Now can I go? Not so fast, my dear. If and when agent 32 brings us the eyes of Egoli, we'll need to dispose of both you and your boyfriend anyway. He is not my boyfriend. Ugh, gross! Hangar six, hangar six. Rene's been kidnapped. Eyes of Egoli, eyes of Egoli. Wait a minute. If I've got this guy Egoli's eyes, how did he dial the phone? Yoo-hoo! Rene! Anybody home? Hello? Rene? Hello, anybody home? Agent 32, a.k.a. Ernest. Ernest P. W. Put the eyes of Egoli on the tray to the left of you and roll it towards me. Your other left. Oh, yeah. I knew that. Oh, knock it off and just give it back their goo-goo eye thing. Rene, are you all right? Mr No, Ernest, I am not all right. Now give them back their stuff. I don't have their stuff. Bazoo, search him. Hey, watch it. I don't know what you're trying to pull Agent 32. You saunter in here without the eyes. You know I'm going to have to kill both of you. Both of us? On the other hand, maybe you're the perfect pawn to play against Kazim and Epopo. Here's your yo-yo. You will have plenty of time to learn a few tricks on the way to where you're going. [engine starts] Ugh, well, finally. I am out of here. Thank you very much. That is very hard on the wrists. I'm sure your comrades will be happy to see you when you arrive in Africa. - Africa? Africa. Wait, I can't go to Africa. I haven't had my shots. The mosquitoes there are big enough to stand flat footed and-- [music playing] Easy, ow! Come here, my girl. I hope you're going to re-run that movie-- [grunts] I said I hope you're going to re-run that movie. You know that part where the scorpion crawls up that guy's spine? And the old lady's face rotted after she killed the girl in the shower? Hey, was her name Rosebud? You know, in these overseas flights they let you keep the barf bag and it-- [grunts] Take him to the power station and make him talk. Yes, sire. Uh, look can we just go to a hotel, have a bath or so-- Sit down and shut up. All right, all right. [muffled speech] Want to make him shut up. Ah! Well, at least I'm out of that stuffy truck. Where am I? Ugh. Just get this back off. I smell water. Water! I'm near water somewhere, I'm near water. I'm stuck. Oh, my head! Ow. Whoa! Ah! I do so hate being a rude host, but I need to attend to more pressing business upstairs. And since you and Bazoo have become such warm friends, I'm sure that he'll attend to your every desire while I'm away. Ugh. You certainly won't be bored. [music playing] Mr. Thompson. The woman I saw you with, she has beautiful eyes. So she does, especially when she flashes them. I should hear more about this remarkable woman. If you come any closer to me, Bazoo, I swear to you, I will toss my cookies all over your bright and shiny boots. And believe me, they will be sticky up for weeks. When my boyfriend, Ernest-- when my friend, Ernest, gets here, he's gonna kick butt and take names. You better keep your distance. Yeah right, Rene. My employer is a very demanding man. He once bought a bird from a street vendor, and when the bird wouldn't sing, he cut out the vendor's tongue and fed it to the bird. A bit excessive, I thought, but-- We all have our own particular management style. My employer is getting a bit nervous. The eyes of Egoli have evaded your grasp, yet you still have our million dollar advance. Lunch money. It would be advisable if I were able to report some progress. You can report that I have my own little bird that will sing. So Bazoo, can I call you Baz? I bet you were a football player in school. Linebacker? [grunts] I was a cheerleader. Well, no, that's not true actually. I was a substitute, you know, a bench warmer. I couldn't cartwheel. They are the toughest, and they were such sticklers for them. Have you ever tried one? Wanna try one? No? I could try one. There is no need to cause undue friction between us. We are, how you say, um, on the same team? Same team? Then let's play big league ball. It's time to renegotiate my contract. [groaning] Ooh. Kazim's boy has caught that little street thief that you sent to pluck the eyes from my safe. Now that little snake is with his own kind. Is that any way to treat a partner? You certainly know how to treat a partner. I remember only you returning from Sinkatutuland. Some partners just can't keep up. He missed his flight. When do we get the eyes of Egoli? When I receive $6 million in my account in the Caymans. That is double what we agreed on. In big league ball that's what it's like dealing with a free agent. [dog barking] Welcome to the club, sir. Thank you, John. Hey, you, stop. Stop there. You! Who are you? (WITH ACCENT) I-- I am Omar Hey You Abdu Abdul Billy-bazi, but you can call me Hey You. Hey You? At your service. I work here day and night. In the day I spray the walkways. I use thousands of liters of water just to a move one leave. It is wonderful. Thousands die every day in the Sudan of thirst, but here there is such plenty. I've never seen you. I give much service. I carry all the bags for the big shots. I know all the big shots. Hey You! You see, I am on first name basis with big shots. I am coming, sahib. I come to give you good service. I will help you with these bags. It is not a problem. Ho ho! This is a wonderful game. How many times do you have to put the sticks back in the bag? Is this a good score? Rene! Rene! Want a cheer? OK. (SINGING) Fred and Wilma, Pebbles, too, think that Bazoo's yabba dabba doo. La de da-- Bazoo is the best. La de da-- the best of all the rest. La de da-- Bazoo is the best. La de da, La de da, La de da da da. Cartwheel! Splits! You look like you need a drink. Hey You! At your service, sahib. Service is my middle name. Well, actually, my middle name is Karala. Come over here. Oh, what is your desire, oh great one? I'd like a scotch and water. Will that be with ice, oh anointed one, who's spittle is sacred balm? - Yes, with ice. Cubed or shaved, oh majestic one, whose flip-flop is the serving spoon of the poor. Cubed. As I was saying, Jameen-- In a tall or short glass, oh, special one? One whose flatulence is the perfume of the night? Tall. Good, grief what's wrong with you? Oh, nothing oh splendid one, whose earwax is the high price spread? Get your hands off me, you filthy urchin! Thank you, chosen one whose urinal is the soup bowl of the poor. Did you hear what I said? Yes, yes. Get out. That is one scotch in a tall glass with cubes. Do you want fries with that? No! Yes, going. I go, I go, explicit one, whose toe jamb is the toothpaste of the unworthy. It will be as you wish, oh supreme on, whose sweat is the nectar of the bee. Adjusting that maybe to cut the, sort of, mustiness in here, we could have some kind of air freshener, like a pine or-- uh, you know, like a-- --baby powder. All right. Judging by your scowl I guess not. How about a potpourri? That diamond mine, Harold says, we'll be wealthy beyond our wildest dreams. Unfortunately, he didn't tell me where the mine was before he took the deep 6. And now, here I am, an old woman with no money and no relatives, marooned in a dark continent, friendless and betrayed. If only I could get some help some where. Perhaps you people could be so kind as to help me. Hey lady, what you doing here? Get out of here. If you people will excuse me, I've come to bury my husband, Harold, in the flames of the gentleman's club he was so fond. This is not a funeral home, now, get out! He smoked enough cigars here to kill four men. What? What are you talking about? Tight wad took me on a cruise. The buffet was so cheap, all they had was beanie weenies on tooth picks and Ritz crackers. Arnold popped one of the weenies in his mouth, choked on the toothpick, and keeled over dead. Hey-- hey, lady, listen-- Wouldn't you don't know it, he died in international waters. The insurance companies said, all bets were off. I've had to live on my salary teaching charm school. Well, here you are, Arnold, the place you so loved. Ashes to ashes. Oh! Ah! Thank you, Harold. That's the only noble thing you've ever done. Ernest! Ernest! Oh, yeah. Ernest! That was great. Oh, what a fetching color, my dear. Thanks. You can untie me now. Oh yeah, sorry. RENE: Come on! Hurry, Rene. Hurry! They're right behind us. Grab that golf cart. Oh, Ernest, you were wonderful. So brave, so daring, so adventurous, I mean, wow! Rene, you will find that men, by nature, are divided into two main categories, those with 11 fingers and those without. Know what I mean? No! [grunts] Wake up, you idiot. Where is she? You let her get away. Don't let them get away. They can't be far. Where have you been? You - It's a long story. - I bet it is. Get in the Rover. You're very lucky you do not fall. I've seen the figures. I don't think that Donovan-- ERNEST: Are we slick or what? RENE: Isn't this lovely-- I wish this thing had a radio. If it hadn't been for my NASCAR training, they might have us on that last turn. I remember once at Talladega, Dale Earnhardt had kind of caught me of on the right-- Ernest, you know what? This is a nice clearing. I think we should make camp here. Why don't you go find us some firewood? Firewood? Yeah. Well, where would a guy find firewood? Well, in the woods, of course. Oh, yeah, wood. Firewood. Yeah, okay-- Oh, wow. [growling] RENE: --a bag of chips, oh, I'm starved. Yeah, I'll bet somebody else is starved too. Well, luckily we won't have to cook those chips. [laughs] Go on, Ernest. Go and get us some firewood. What are you waiting on? But first, Rene, I need some bug repellent spray. Oh, oh, oh, oh, ho! Ernest. And of course, I'll need my high tech tiger-proof vest; my NATO approved snake leggings, resistant even to the Arctic whistling snow viper; my nuclear, high-fidelity killer-bee repulser helmet; my state-of-the-art rhino wrestling gloves; my trusty chainsaw; and last but not least, some bananas to bribe the monkeys. It's always good, Rene, to have the monkeys on your side. All we need is some firewood. Stand back, local species. I'm coming for the wood. [chainsaw and growling] Oh yeah? Well, I think you're just a whiny sore loser. You can keep the chainsaw. Where do you want the wood? Well, you're late. Sorry. Nice fire. [music playing] You idiots have lost both Ernest and the girl. Now, you've hunted leopard at night. This is a golf-cart, for Pete's sake. The leopard is more predictable. Now, get on with it! Ernest? Yeah. You were awfully brave out there today. Oh, shucks, that was nothing. I-- I always carry that kind of equipment in case anything like this ever happens. No, I don't mean the firewood. I mean when you saved me. You rescued me from Thompson's killers. I mean, you were just like that really handsome guy from those adventure movies, Illinois Smith. Yeah, like "Illinois Smith and the Curse of Hitler's Brain?" When the Nazis were hanging all over the truck, and Illinois Smith was driving on two wheels, and he had his Luger in his teeth? Ernest? Do you remember when he kissed the girl? Yeah. And then he pulls out his bullwhip, and he jams the handle in the gears, and they all flew off the truck? Was Illinois scared? Not at all. Not Illinois Smith. He just reared back and kicked it to the metal. Took it-- Goodnight, Ernest. Ah, good night. And that's when the propeller tore off the plane and slammed into the fuselage. Well, he wasn't scared, though. He never backed off an inch. Hey, remember when he was in the sacred temple? Remember that? - Yeah. Yeah. And-- And that big rock started rolling down on him. And the piggies were running after him and they were shooting-- [yawn] [music playing] I don't know about you, but I slept like a baby. You look like you slept like a paperclip. Ah! Ow. [elephant call] I'll drive. OK. I'll just go around that way. OK. [elephant grumbles] Maybe I'll just go around that way. Yeah, go around. OK. No problem. Why don't you come around this way? Yeah, come around this way. Okay. Excuse us. Pardon me. You know what, climb this way. Can you climb-- I'll just-- All right, here. There we go. You're okay. Thank you. Oh, no problem. There we go. Good. Let's go. We're set. [elephant call] Not only were you unsuccessful, but I believe Thompson has doubled his price. Before you pass judgement on me, oh gracious one, allow me to inform you that the bird flies into the falcon's grip. Hmm. Then, we must sharpen and the falcon's talons, hmm? Very good, sir. Very, very, very, very good. Whoa! Whoa. We caught a little wind, there. Of course we caught a little wind, Ernest. We have a bush the size of Kansas on top of the cart. Yeah, it's a little trick I learned in Nam. It's called camouflage. So they won't see us. And why would they notice us? Two very white people in a bushy golf cart somewhere in the middle of Africa. It happens all the time. It does? Are you enjoying those leaves your eating? Mhm. It's a natural bush plant. Very nutritious. I learned about this in survival school. Oh. It's funny, I just never knew that poison ivy was edible. Poison ivy? Yeah, real tangy. Look, there's a giraffe over there. Oh, where? Right over there, next to that bush. Oh, I don't see it. Right there, right there! I don't see it. Oh, point it out. Yeah, it must have been a-- like a tall warthog. [laughs] [plane buzzing] I've just flown all over this continent and they're nowhere to be found. I'm running low on fuel. I don't care if you're gliding into the wall. Don't come back here without having pinpointed their exact location. Wait a minute. There's a [inaudible] bush moving down the road. What? Let's go. I don't know about you, but that poison ivy kind of made me kind of thirsty. Yup, I'm kind of parched, myself. Good, see that shanty up ahead there? Those natives look friendly enough. And since I speak 19 Zulu dialects-- Ernest, where did you learn 19 Zulu dialects? I used to work in a record store. Just pull over here. Good, good. You wait here. You have to know how to talk to these people. Hey, homies, what's happening? What it is, bro? [laughing] [mumbling] Oh, Ernest. Black suit, black tie, cheap shades? Bad guy. [squeals] My head. Ugh. I trust your trip to my palace was relaxing. Uh. I understand that you are somehow connected to the eyes of Egoli, but you have not been too generous with the information that you possess. I assure you, that by the time this evening is over, you will gladly cooperate. In fact, you might find cooperation extremely pleasurable. I don't feel so good. I really don't need this. Oh! Ugh. [non-english speech] Well, then the bank president says, it's a nick knack paddy Jack, give the frog a loan. Knick knack paddy Jack, give the frog a loan. Ah, say, did you see the girl with the glasses and the long skinny legs? Skinny legs, Kazim. Kazim? Which way? Kazim. Hmm, okay. It's a nick knack paddy Jack-- --give the frog a loan! Kazim, kazim. That oughta be easy enough to find. Come, ladies. WOMAN: Come on, girls! Up, up, up! The great Kazim bids your company. Oh! Ugh. Here's my chance. Ouch! Watch it, pal. I really think he's cute I'm just playing hard to get. [music playing] [bells] Kareem, you old dog. You never told me about this new member of our flock. I wanted to surprise you, anointed one. You, come sup with me. Me? [giggle] I am unworthy, swami sahib. Oh, don't be such a silly little girl. Come, share a bowl of the sea's bounty. It will heighten your senses this evening. [giggles] Sit here? Are you hungry, my little flower? Starved. Ah, the sweetest fruits for the sweetest flower. [gobbling noises] Some, uh, leg of turkey, perhaps? [gobbling noises] [burp] A good appetite is a sign of passion. That watermelon looks good. [gong] [slurping noises] Yes. Ooh. Oh. Ugh. How silly of me. Ho ho ho. Now, let's have a little look at that lovely face. No, no, no. Oh, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no. Oh, yes, yes, yes. No, no, no. Oh, yes, yes, yes. No! Oh, just one little peek. What secrets do you hide? [giggle] Oh, we have a frisky one, here. Just one little kiss. Ah! Ew. Guard! Guard! [screaming] Ernest! Ernest! Ah! Knock it off! Guards! Guards! - Look out for the elephant. - What elephant? Oh, come on! Oh-- [non-english speech] --if the nick knack paddy Jack, give the frog a loan [non-english speech] --Ernest! Kazim, skinny legs, Kazim! [non-english speech] Kazim's got both of them. Things are gonna get ugly. Let's go. [non-english speech] Now that Prince wasn't so bad. He had a nice smile. The food was good. Of course, the band could have used a little work. Ernest, are you out of your mind? That Prince would've killed you in a New York minute. He's never even been to New York. Well, A Nairobi minute, whatever. Hey, look! Ernest, there's a truck. Come on, let's hitch a ride. Two harem girls in the middle of nowhere. Must be my lucky day. Hello! Hello, girls. How far are you going? Johannesburg, please. Well, I'm not going that far. Oh, how far are you going? My place. What you do that for? I don't know, I saw a girlfriend do it once. Here, let's stick him in the back of the truck. Buh-bye. Rene, next time, try to knock out a skinny ostrich farmer, OK? [car engine] [gun shots] Ernest, you better hurry up. It's Kazim-- I hope you're on Ernest, cause I'm outta here. [gun shots] Ernest, duck! That's it. This means war. This should be the hail mary pass of the season. He fades back, back. He passes! [whistle] It's good! I need more of something-- more leverage. That's it. Oh! Ernest, look out! You gotta couple of deadly 38's. Well, I gotta couple a 40's. [whistle] Yup! Yeah! Another one! More ammo. Never mind. Ah! Ernest, hit them, not me. [gunshots] [whistle] All right, direct hit! It lifts, it separates, it's a training bra barrage. Ugh, these drive-by shootings are worse than LA. Hey, fellas, how about a nice Egg McOstrich? [whistle] Whoa, these are gonna hurt. [whistle] How do you like them, fellas? Sunny side up or scrambled? [whistle] Atta-boy, biggie! [whistle] Yes! We got 'em! Yes! Good-bye, Charlie. [music playing] [non-english speech] I get my master-- Oh! Good, gracious. Excuse me, I think you'll be needing some permission to go in there. Mr. Thompson. We're so happy to see you again, Mr. Thompson. Where's Kazim? He's tending to some personal business and can't be undisturbed. Bazoo, twist this man's head till it comes off. But, no business is so important that it can't be disturbed for Kazim's friend Mr Thompson. But I must warn you, he's with Dorothy. Dorothy, huh? He must be having some real fun. She is his favorite. Oh, my darling Dorothy. I am the luckiest man in the world. No, no, have mercy great one. Please, I don't want to die. They were too fast for us. Have mercy, I beg of you! Where is my Darling, Dorothy? Oh, there she is. Oh, come my sweet little dumpling. Now, let's watch Dorothy play the soccer, huh? Oh, come, my little Dove. Oh! No! No, don't! Come, come, my sweet little pumpkin pie. Aah! [sound of heads rolling] I see they lost them. I seldom tolerate failure. Well, failure can be quite embarrassing. I stole the eyes, you had them stolen from me, Mr. Rabaz stole them from you, Ernest and the girl stole the eyes from Mr. Rabaz, and now you have nothing. Perhaps you should dance with Dorothy. I, uh, believe your price has doubled. When I get unwanted help, I get expensive. Very well, Mr. Thompson, no help. But I warn you, failure will result in dire consequences. I won't fail. This has become personal. Now where are they? They were last seen heading north toward the border. The forbidden border. Very well. Oh! Dorothy! Well, looks like we hoof it from here. Well, these should be a little bit more comfortable than those gold lame heels. Thanks, so fashionable. Ernest? Yeah? There's something I'm just dying to tell you. Yes? It's about your eyes. Yes? These things are driving me crazy. Ahh! Ah! Ah! I've been thrust into eternal darkness! Which way is America? West. But I don't think I can make it, Ernest, these boots are awful. Well, you know what they say, Rene, the journey of 1,000 miles begins with but a single step. Believe me, Ernest, I walked 1,000 miles across that restaurant, but I had practical shoes on. Well, survival training dictates that we always keep our boats pulled up tight. Ah, it doesn't matter anyway. We're gonna be dead before we reach those hills. Well, Maybe not dead, but bleeding profusely from poisonous thorns and maybe convulsing with malaria fever. That makes me feel better. Good. It's always good to keep you morale up. Ow! They were here, but now they're gone. Well, they never cross the escarpment alive. We'll have to catch them before the hyenas swallow the eyes of Egoli whilst it's chewing on their decaying bodies. [laughs] What are you laughing at? You should be visiting Dorothy. Let's go. What are you doing? I'm communing with nature. Communing with nature? Ernest, let's get going. When one is with nature, one is at one with nature. Are you trying to be philosophical? The masses have always had to rise up against the opposition-- RENE: I'm leaving, Ernest! OK, gosh. There are no punishments or rewards in nature, Rene. Just consequences. Yeah, I know, consequences. Well, hey, I was just trying to make the best of things. Shoe's untied. - What? - Gotcha. Oh! [laughs] Sorry. How much further is it? RENE: I have no idea, Ernest. Africa is a big continent. ERNEST: I just don't see how we're going to make it. RENE: Through sheer will and determination. ERNEST: But I'm hot. RENE: Yes, Ernest, I'm hot too. But I've decided to be optimistic about this and take a positive attitude. For example, you and I are getting to know each other very well, my calves are firming up nicely, and I've discovered that once you understand wildlife, there's nothing to be afraid of. ERNEST: What's that big crawly thing on your back? RENE: Huh? Oh, that's a big ugly bug, get it off! ERNEST: I don't want to touch it-- RENE: Get it off! ERNEST: No! [rene screaming] No! No! Don't-- I don't want to touch it. No, no, don't get it-- it'll jump off on me. No. Ernest, you know, if we don't make it, I just want you to know how much I-- well, how proud I am of you. I mean, that was really brave, you sneaking into that harem. Oh, it was nothing, really. It was just a big room full of half dressed women. I know I've been somewhat of a snob in the past, you know, wanting things that could never be better. But these last few days have really made me think. She's coming around. I mean, you gotta admire those pioneer women on the Oregon Trail for stamina alone. Oh, I'll tell you Ernest, when I get back-- if I get back, things are going to change. I mean, this experience has really opened my eyes. Opened up your eyes to the old Worrel charm, baby. Oh, Ernest. Yes, baby? We can't do this. Yes, we can. No, it's the end. Already? Look, it's over. Over there! We can't get across that river. Oh, gosh, not another river. I'm tired, I'm thirsty, my feet are killing me, we've got more of these prickly things to deal with-- Oh, Ernest, quit your whining. I'm trying to assess with the situation, here. My underwear is sticking, my legs itch right here from gosh knows what, I've got a big mosquito bite right on my-- Good! Good? Yes, that's it! What's it? Legs. Yeah, they itch right here. No, no, my legs. What, You scratch your own legs? I just gotta take off my pants. Ugh, have you no shame, woman? After all, this is not a seventh grade gym class. Well, this is what happens when a 90s woman falls for you. Maybe I'm just an old fashioned kind of guy, but I guess you're just a victim of the old Worrel charm. Here, blow these up. Blow them up? Yeah, blow up my pants. You mean, put air in them? Well, it's not like you're in short supply. Blow. Oh, yeah, this is going to work. [music playing] OK, it's your turn now. Oh, not again. I'm tired. Oh, please, Ernest. Finish blowing this thing up. Look, our only way out of here is to use my pants as a float and ride us down the river. Ride down the river? The river, Rene, is full of African blood-sucking vampire fish. The kind of fish, Rene, that can reduce an entire herd of buffalo to skeletons in a matter of moments, Rene. A Vampire fish, Ernest, are not African. They are Australian, Ernest. I saw it on cable. Now, finish blowing this thing up. OK, give it here. [explosion] Oh. That clump of trees is the only place they could be. Come on, Renee. Walking down this river is not going to get us anywhere but further down this river. We've got to find a way to get across. Well, maybe we should get somebody to carry us across, like a ferry. I think we have. But they don't look like fairies. Uh oh. Ernest. Not to worry, Rene. I know this tribe. They're friendly. Hey! How y'all doing? Ernest, [squeaks] RENE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see what you mean. Real friendly fairies. ERNEST: Well, at least we didn't have to walk, Ms. Ungrateful. [africans chanting] RENE: See, all I'm saying is, if you didn't stamp so hard with your feet, it might be a comfy ride. Oh, [inaudible]. ERNEST: Gosh, I wish this song had some different lyrics. [non-english speech] What's he saying? [non-english speech] [laughter] [non-english speech] See, I told you. Would you look at this? One never uses oregano in a soup with basil. No wonder they call them the lost tribe. Ah! Ernest, what are they doing? They're giving us a massage. You know, I think they're tenderizing. Watch it, fella, these are pre-washed jeans. Ouch! [laughter] You know hard it is to get spear holes out of pre-washed jeans? Ernest, they're gonna eat us. Yeah, well, wait till they get a load of that poison ivy. [non-english speech] Oh, I think he wants you to empty your pockets. Yeah, I wouldn't want him to break a cap on anything hard. Goodbye little, yo-yo. CROWD: Ooh. Ho! CROWD: Ooh. Ah. Oh, you like that, huh? CROWD: Ya. Well, what do you think about this? Whoa! Hit it, Wally. [renee imitates band] Hey, you people having a good time out there? Well, let's give it up, come on! Where are you folks from? CROWD: Yeah! Yeah, that's my kinda town. I bet you're enjoying this show, aren't ya? Yeah, and we're having a ball doing it for you. Hey, Wally, don't I always say that the Sinkatutu are the very best crowd we have on this whole circuit? Come on, folks, let's give it up for Wally and the Cruisers! Let's give it up for the band. Take a little bow, Wally. And remember, folks, your waiter works on tips. So good night, and drive safely. Wally, take them on out. There's no way they could've made it across. They had to go through the Katanga Pass. This is Sinkatutu land. They're dead anyway. Let's go back. You, pathetic sniveling cowards. I'm not a coward. Sinkatutu land is forbidden. Those that have entered this land have never come back. I should have dumped you both when you lost them the first time. Now, get out of my sight. Well, Rene, you can't say I don't treat you like a Queen. The [inaudible] magic is great. Any wish you desire is our command. How about a one-way ticket to Cleveland? Cleveland? WOMEN: Ah, Cleveland! Cleveland. Um, say, chief, aren't you also a high priest or something like that? Yeah, boo, high priest. So, uh, how about you, uh, marrying me and me and the little lady here. Ernest, you haven't exactly talked to me about this. Look, just play along. This is part of my master escape plan. What, master escape plan? We don't need a master escape plan. We're in charge here. [non-english speech] I just don't see why we have to have a marriage. Just play along, it's safer. Ernest! Excuse me, I-- I haven't agreed to anything! Ladies I bet the men in your tribe don't make it this way. The nerve of that man So, uh, we're going to have like a bachelor party? Sit around, belch out loud, talk about guy stuff? No. Fertility rights. Oh, no, uh, I already had that operation a long time ago when I was real little. - Think of it as a booster. - A booster. Oh. [non-english speech] Boy, am I ever glad to see you. [non-english speech] [non-english speech] This man is a thief of the Sinkatutu. [non-english speech] There are two men who stole the eyes of the Egoli. The one man, he flew away in the white bird. And the other one, you caught. Oh, ho. This man flies the white bird. Wait a minute, I didn't steal the eyes of Egoli or anything else. [non-english speech] I call for the battle of truth. [non-english speech] Battle of truth? On second thought, maybe I'd just rather have the booster. [crowd cheering] RENE: Oh, yay! Yay, Ernest Go, Ernest! Hmm. Not bad. Hmm. Yeah. Ernest, will you hurry up, please. Anything worth doing, Rene, is worth doing right. Well, at least I have time on my side. [laughs] Ernest, get me outta here! [non-english speech] Ernest! Don't worry, Rene, I have everything under control. It has begun, the battle of truth. Beat the clock. No, you, idiot! Hammer on him, not the clock! I was just following instructions, Rene. She's never satisfied. Ernest! Ernest, watch out! [non-english speech] Missed me, missed me, la la la la la la la. Ernest, look out, he's got one of those axe things! Ah! Missed me, again. Give me the eyes of Egoli, or I'll cut you in half. Nice shot, dip wad! RENE: Ernest. Ernest! Where are you? You wanna hold Teddy? [crowd cheering] [renee screaming] Ernest. Ernest, Ernest, watch out! Pay attention! Oh! Whoa! Oh, oh, oh. RENE: Keep going. Keep going! Aah. [laughs] You're stuck. Now you die, Agent 32. RENE: Oh, no! Oh, Ernest. Ernest, get me out of here! Turn around. Come on, man! Don't give up! That's it! You've cost me a fortune. Now, give me what is mine! I don't have anything that belongs to you. Ernest, your yo-yo! At-ta boy! Give it to him! Yes! Yeah! And now for the famous around the world. RENE: Ah, yes! Ha ha! [non-english speech] [crowd cheering] I guess that was worth the price of admission. Ah! Ow! Don't stand there. Ouch! All right, Chief. Time out! ERNEST: Ow, get off me! Ow! You, get off! Ow. [crowd cheering] Ernest P. Worrel, what on earth are you doing? I am dying up here. You walk around like Mr. Big Shot while I'm up here with my rump roasting. You know, the least you could do is just give me a little help and save me. Any attempt would be much appreciated, instead of some macho show of manhood at a sporting event! Ah! Ernest! Three more notches and I gotta real skin problem here, and it's all your fault! You know what? Correction. It's my fault. I'm just a-- a little hot. I get kind of moody when I'm hot. Ernest, let's talk about this-- Ah! Ernest, you're a doll. You are the sweetest thing that ever lived. You are truly my knight in shining armor. Rene, Rene, Rene. You were never in any real danger. After all, I am Ernest P. Worrel. [laughs] Ow! Ow! [non-english chanting] You gotta do it. OK, Betty. Oh, hi, Rene. Hi. - Are you ready for our date? - Um-- Oh, look! I-- I brought us a souvenir from our adventure. It's an ostrich egg. I painted it and everything. Oh, Ernest, this is so sweet of you. Thank you. Ernest, we have to talk. Yeah, well, we have plenty of time on the date. No, Ernest, I have to tell you something. Yeah? Ernest, I can't go out with you. All my life I thought what I wanted was Illinois Smith, but these last few days have taught me such an important lesson. Ernest, you are just too wild and adventurous for me. And that's why I've decided I needed someone like Todd Lafsky. He's the bookkeeper at Wilson's Army Navy store. You know, he's a local boy. He's got his feet on the ground. He's just an ordinary schmo. But I thought you said I was just an ordinary schmo. Ernest P. Worrel, don't you ever let anyone call you an ordinary schmo. Because you are a dynamic schmo. Well, I-- I sensed there might be a problem. Maybe, I was a little too worldly for you, a little too continental, a little too wild, perhaps. Good bye, Ernest. Good bye, Rene. Yeah, guys like me, we have to try to travel the lonely road. A rebel, a lone wolf, leaving a trail of broken hearts behind me. Yeah, Rene. It's time for the rogue of the open road to set off again on his quest for high adventure. Another place, babe. Another time. [egg cracking] Oh ho ho. Oh. Oh. [music playing]
