Oh, no you don't! Try to have a little patience. Remember, you are ladies! Oh, come on! Try and have a little dignity, will you? Over my dead body! Hey, what's the idea? We were trying to do a full routine. And you stopped right in the middle. Listen, kids, I'm stuck. Maybe you can help me out. What rhymes with I love you? Your rent is due, and I want it! Listen, Mrs. Wilson, I'm about to finish a great composition. Now listen to me. I'm tired of all this stalling. I want... It came from up front. Who fired that shot? There, Sally. Right here, Sally. Here we start. Perfect. No, over here, Sally. Sally. That's it fella. That's it. No, over here. The finale, Sally. Right there, that's it. Ah! There she... there she is. Maybe they shot each other! Open this door! It's Simon Legree. Think, Little Eva, think of something now. Let me in. Get Sally. Come on, Sally. Open this door. How can they when they shot each other? Come on, open that door. - You be a good girl, now. - Put your head up here. - Put your head up here. - Don't move, Sally, please. Here, here. Listen... Let me in! Now get out of my way, I'll get in. Ah! Oh! Ah, Mrs. Wilson, I'm so sorry. Oh! It's all my fault. Oh! It's all my fault. I should have been more careful! What is this? Oh, that. Ha, ha, ha. That... that's the finish of our new act. And is it a riot. Yes, and you're causing a riot. And besides that, I heard a shot. A shot? Oh yeah, that's our revolver. We didn't know it was loaded. Yes, but I heard it twice. Sure, ha, ha. We had to fire it twice to be sure that it wasn't loaded once. Are you sure that it's empty now? Oh, sure. Show her. Ah! Oh! Why, Mrs... Oh! Mrs Wilson. Ah, I've been shot! Oh, listen, it was only a blank cartridge. You just got the wadding. The wadding, uh? I want you to quit making a shooting gallery out of my hotel. Yes, Mrs. Wilson. What was that? Oh that, ha, ha. That's my partner. You know, that's another part of our act, uh... Oink, oink. Oink! Now you see? Oink! Well, what was that? Oink, oink. Oink, oink. Oink. Oink, oink. Oh, he's playing a seal is he? Uh, yeah. He's, uh, Ha! Sewing him up this, and shut him up. Or I will. No, you go. I'll keep him quiet. Oink, oink. Well, he's got to be quiet. Oink, oink, oink. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, rehearsal's over. I don't think she likes our act. It certainly looks fishy to me. What did you do with the bucket? The bucket? Yes, But I... er, say, ahem. You're keeping something undercover. Oh! Oops! Oh, in heaven's name, what is that? Oh, that's a sea-going carnivorous mammal. A what? Just plain seal to you, Mrs. Wilson. Well, whatever it is, get it out of here. Oh, but Mrs. Wilson, Sally is an artist, brought from the wilds of Oklahoma at terrific expense in order to make her New York debut at the Eldridge Theater. I don't care if she makes her debut at the Metropolitan Opera House. I'll give you to 6:00 o'clock to pack up her things and get her out of here. Oh! Go to your rooms! Did he say the Eldridge Theater? Eldridge Theater? Why that place is haunted. I wouldn't work in that spook trap for $1,000 a week. Say, for $1,000 a week, I'd play in a mousetrap. Well, here we are. Goodie, goodie. Hey, hey, they're opening next week. They must be in rehearsal. Yeah, it's a good thing we got here, huh? Are you sure you know the manager? Know him? Ha! We're just like this. Well, I'll go in with you. Oh, no, wait a minute. Uh, you stay here, because we went to the stage and give Sally our grand entrance. OK. Ha, ha, ha. Oh, it's a girl's show. Hey, where is everybody? How should I know? What was that? Oh, that's a door. Huh! I knew it all the time. Hey, wait a minute. No. We've got to find this guy. Say listen, are you kidding? Kidding? This is important business with me. This is my livelihood! I don't like the looks of this place. Let's get out of here. Well, we've got to find Eldridge. Can't we use the phone? Oh, shut up! There must be someone around here. Hello! Hello. Get down, there. Who was that? Why, that's you. But I'm down here. Of course you are. Then how did I get up there? That's your voice, that's an echo. Well, how did my voice get up there? Here, I'll show you. Ta da da da da da da da da. The king! Shh! You must be very quiet during the performance. Ha, ha! Shh! You get down. Get down. Isn't he magnificent? Yeah. He's colossal. He's positively invisible. Bravo. Bravo! Has he finished? Yes. Just listen to that audience! They're going crazy. They're going crazy? Yes. Bravo. Get down, Roger. Bravo! Come on, men. Ah, there ain't nobody here. Ole, Ole! Oh, ho, Ole! Ole! Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute! Wait a minute here. Come on, get up from there, will ya? Is he... is he demented? No. We're all right. Come on, Roger. Quiet. Wait a minute, I'm all right. Why don't you be calm, like me? Has he gone? Yeah. You know, for... for a moment, I thought it was us. Wasn't it? Of course not! Oh! Ole. What? I don't feel so good. I feel something coming over us. So so I. Ghosts! Barricade that door. Get some furniture, hurry up! Help me. Are you Mr. Eldridge? I'm not Mr. Eldridge. Don't tell me you're Mrs. Eldridge? I'm Mr. Bailey. Not Barnum and Bailey? Well, I've got the greatest thing that... Wait a minute! Wait. I own this theater. I'm Miss Eldridge. Ha, ha, ha. We found an Eldridge. Why Miss Eldridge, we've travelled 1,000 miles to see you. I have a letter of introduction here from a friend... that is, I did have. Hey, you've got it. I've got it? No, you've got it. Wait a minute, I put it right in your vest pocket. Hey, wait a minute. You've got it down here. I saw a little white... Now, it's over here. I put it in this pocket, right down here. Hey, wait it... it's down here. I put it down here. Hey, give me that letter. I... It ain't funny, already. Give me that letter, will you? Come on! Listen. Hey, wait a minute. I... I know I put it in here, I tell ya! I put it in there! Stop, will ya? Stop! Will ya please stop! Maybe he's got it. Oh! Oh! Stop! This is no laughing matter. Never mind the letter. What do you want? We want to show you the eighth wonder of the world. And it's not on a postcard. No, in the flesh. Stupendous, dynamic, why she's colossal! What? Seeing is believing. Yes, and we'll prove ya. Come on, Ole, let's show 'em. Wait here. We'll be right back. We'll be right back, all right? Stay right there. Now do you understand why I want you to give up this theater? It's overrun with echoes and lunatics! Dad built this old theater. It was his whole life. I don't believe he would want me to give it up. Probably not. He was a showman, not a businessman. Yet, if he knew the trouble it would cause you, he'd want you to dispose of it. Somehow, I think he'd rather have me keep it open, with a show. And you know, if I had a hit, I could pay back all the money I've borrowed from you. A hit in this jinxed house? Joan, let me try to get rid of the theater before you lose everything to your creditors. Think it over, my dear. Lady, you're now going to really hear something. Yes, ma'am. Presenting Sally, the only singing seal in captivity. Born on Christmas Day! Yeah. Ha, ha, ha. She's a Christmas seal. Come on, now. Come on. Get over here and sit down at the piano. Now do your stuff. Play it like it never played before. Me me me me me me me. La la la la la la la la. Sally, please sing. Come on. Oh, Sally, this is your favorite tune. Come on. Sally, you can't let us down now. And just when we got a chance to get into a big show. Wait a minute, boys. You're wasting your time. I haven't any show. What? There hasn't been a show in this theater for two years. Yeah, but we saw a sign downstairs... What about those billboards outside? Oh, those are the old Ramsey Taylor show. Oh, ha, ha. Old Ramsey Taylor. Hey, we know him well, don't we? Oh. We're just like brothers. Ramsey Taylor's dead. - Dead? - Certainly. Don't you remember? He wrote and told us all about it? It's too bad. He was murdered two years ago during a dress rehearsal... right in this room, on that very spot. Oh! Come on, let's get out of here. No wonder Sally wouldn't sing in here. Oh, uh, I'm sorry. Noises frighten me. Oh, for a boiler factory. What? Ha, ha. I said, I'm sorry noises frighten you. And I'm sorry I've wasted all your time. But I like the pretty noises you made on the piano. Well, then it wasn't a waste. I met you and you like my music. More noise? Have you more? A whole portfolio full of noise, practically bedlam. Give me bedlam. Hey, is this your car? No. Oh, oh, the car. Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. We... Why certainly it's our car. You don't suppose for one minute we'd be driving a car that doesn't belong to us, do you? Certainly it's our car. We've had the car for over 10 years. It's a little thing we whipped up ourselves. Don't you know enough not to park next to a fire plug? Now get out of here before I give you a ticket. Yes, officer. Well, you heard what he said. Get out of here. Yeah, but I don't know how to drive a car. Well, you're going to learn fast. Shh! Oh, boys, I have a letter for you. Thanks. Oh, that's swell. I wonder if it introduces me? Here, come on. Thank you. Uh... Come on, let's get upstairs. Yeah, thanks. You're... you're welcome. Mamie! Listen, you know those two new boarders? Yes. They just came into a lot of money. How do you know? Well, uh, well, you know, they dropped a letter. And I couldn't help but read it. How much did they get? I don't know. Well, we've got to find out! All right, come on, come on. What's the bad news? Hey, listen. They've sold our filling station. How much? $150. We're rich, Ole! We're rich! We're rich! There, what did I tell you? Shh! What's the matter now? You know, something seems to tell me we shouldn't have sold our business. Now we've got nothing. Shame on ya. Shame on ya! We're worth over $1 million. $1 million? Yes! You wouldn't take a half a million for your half of Sally - would ya? - No. Neither would I. You're right. You're right! We're worth exactly one million, one hundred and fifty dollars! Ha, ha. And $0.17. $1 million! Girls, girls, come quickly. I have something to tell ya. $1 million! What? $1 million. Boys, I tell ya, this show of mine's a knockout. Miss Eldridge is crazy about it. It was made to order for Sally. We'll make her a sensation overnight. I can see it now, her name on Broadway, in lights. How big? That big! Oh, no. What do you think we are? No. Well, what's the matter? It's not big enough. All right, then, that big. That's more like it. What do you say, boys? Are you with us? Well, it sounds OK to me. Wait a minute! Don't jump at collusions. Are you sure Sally will get the starring part? Why, the show was written around her. It's a water carnival. Now fellas, uh, I hate to... Come on, speak up. We're with ya. Yeah, Come on. Don't be afraid. We're regular fellas. Well, you know it will, uh, it will take a little money. Oh, well, we got a little money. Certainly. We're gamblers. We're sports. What do you think we are? We'll do anything for Sally. We'll put Sally over, it it costs us every cent. Oh, ho. It won't take that much. Besides, with you fellas in our organization, why, we can get unlimited credit. Brother, we're in. Oh, thanks! I'll run in front of Miss Eldridge right away. Yes, and I'll ride along, too. What do you think of that? Oh, that's swell. - Thanks, boys! - All right. So long. Hey, we're booked! We're booked! Let's tell Sally! Hey, Sally, Sally, Sally! Sally, you're going to be a star! You're going to be a star! Hey, wait a minute. Are you caught? No, my foot itches. Aw! Come on! We got to go inform! Good morning, good morning. Hello there. Good morning. Get a little good mornings, everybody. Good morning. Boys, I'm sorry you missed Joan's routine. Oh, that's all right. We'll see it later. Just think, we're entertaining the press. Good! Yes, and we had better get in there, or they'll be getting restless. Don't worry about that, we've got a lot of business to do right now. Gentlemen! Morning, good morning. Uh, may I have just a moment of your time? Hey, we got nothing but time. Yeah, but hurry up, I'll tell that right now. Uh, would you just sign this order? It's going to be... Wait a minute! Let me do it. It's my turn. Uh, why you put two crosses. That's right. We have twice as much coming today. Oh, uh, boys, boys, uh, rush. But, uh, hey, listen. What's... uh, what's this for? Oh this? Why, I'm going to fashion this after a copy of the gown worn by the Empress Josephine. Josephine? Yes. Uh, yes. Now, uh, uh, to begin with, we're going to absolutely no back, very daring, of course. Now across the shoulders, we're going to have little baby pearls. Ahem. Then the mother pearls, of course, will slowly uh, descend to the, uh... now the bodice, the bodice is going to be, uh, very, uh, snug. Now to reveal the alluring curves of the feminine body, ha, ha, uh, we're going to have, um, some gold, uh, cloth, you see? Sort of folding very beautifully into the very first flounce. Ahem. Then you see, we'll have the, uh, pleats. Now we will have them... we will have the pleats... ha, ha... we'll have pictures he made of the black, or possibly brown, or, uh, of blue, of the satin that's cut on, uh, the bias. The what? Uh, on the... uh, satin that's cut on the... on the bias. Ha, ha. That's very reasonable, don't you think so? Uh, cut, uh... say, what's the matter with him? Hey, uh, what... what is the bias? Explain to me, what's the bias? Why, the bias is the material, um... now, of course, I don't know just... Well, do you use the bias? I don't know just how many yards we'll, uh... the bodice, of course, will take 12 yards. Then from the bodice down to the first flounce, we say will be 24. 24, 24... that'll be 35. That would be 40 or 42. 42, 55... 68! Screen-o. I... I... I have never really been... Please!... So humiliated in all my life! Haven't you gone yet? Go one, get going! Money is no object. I... leaving everything to me, everything on my shoulders! What do you know about this Bailey? I don't know anymore about it than you do. You've been passing out my dough like it was peanuts. I invest $30,000 in here, just because you were going to get me the theater. And what happens? Here they are, rehearsing under my nose. What happens if the show makes a hit? Miss Eldridge pays off those loans, so where do I stand? I'm so surprised, you could knock me over with a feather. I could. But I'm not going to be so delicate. How are you, Mr. Bailey? How are you? Ha, ha. Hey, is he tickled to see you. How are the two oil millionaires? Ah, marvelous! Generous to a fault. It must be grand to be rich. I think ya got something there. Oh! Where's Miss Eldridge? Miss Eldridge? She's in the office entertaining the gentlemen of the press. Bailey! What are those two guys doing here? They're here to meet those two millionaires. Gee, Ole, wouldn't it be marvelous to be a millionaire? Ah, millionaire! To travel to all the ends of the world, live at the Ritz! And have breakfast in bed. Breakfast in bed. Say, by the way, you owe me a half a dollar. Where is it? Oh, you're not going to forget that $0.50 I owe you, are you? Why should I forget it? You owe it to me, don't ya? I got a little surprise for ya. Yeah? See that spoon? Shame on you. You know, you can go to penitentiary for stealing spoons? Hey, you know you can get $1.00 for that at any pawn shop? Well, what's that got to do with anything? You know you can get $1.00 for that spoon at any pawn shop? Well, what's that got to do with the $0.50 you owe me? Oh, I... I owe you $0.50? Yes. Here. Now you owe me $0.50. Yeah? Well here. Now we're even. All right, boys, enjoy yourself. I'll be back in just a minute. OK. Mr. Bailey! Hello, Joan. Celebration? We're entertaining members of the press. Ahem! Oh, I'm sorry. Joan, you know Pete Phillips? Why, yes. How do you do? Aren't you the gentleman who wanted to buy my theater? Yes. You haven't changed your mind, have you? I should say not. I have a hit on my hands. She hopes she has a hit. Make yourselves at home, will you? - Thank you, Joan. - Now wait a minute. Don't try to make a touch. We got to make a hit for these millionaires. Don't worry, please. When I get through with them, they'll give me an oil well all for myself. Hey, wait a minute. Fix your tie here, huh? Oh, fix your own tie! You ready? Yeah. Boys, the press want to meet the backers of the show. I'm for that. Sure, why not? Gentlemen, we're going to drink a toast. Yeah, let's drink to the petroleum twins... chumps! Yeah, tell 'em who the backers are, why they're spending all this dough. Gentlemen, to the two men who have made all this possible, the backers of our show, Mr. Olsen and Mr. Johnson. Boys, you're gamblers. I hope you make a million. Yeah, let's have another drink. I need it. No, no. Listen, wait, wait, wait. We've got to go out an get Sally a drink. Hey, listen! Wait a minute. You know, I like you fellas. You don't pretend to be anything but what ya really are. Yeah, especially if ya ain't. Yeah. He's always clowning. Ha, ha, ha. Don't look now, but we're supposed to be the millionaires. Are we? Oh, we haven't got a cent. Gee, I'm all confused. Yeah. They're all confused. Well, their word is as good as ours. Oh! Where ya going? I'm going back and stop them before they spend $1 million we haven't got. Broke again. Oh! All right, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. It's just starting, folks, it's just commencing, the greatest show on the Midway. 32 spectacular attractions combined in one great show. Over here, let me call your attention to the Wiggley Sisters and their troop of saucy island dancing girls. All right, come on, get out of my way! Come on, Phillips. Stop them, get away, and clear out of here, everybody! As for you, your goose is cooked! What goose? Aw, now what? Oh, Mr. Bailey, what's the matter? Plenty. Those men are impostors. Your two oil millionaires haven't an oil can between them. "Investigated thoroughly. Olsen and Johnson own no oil property. Left Gusherville owing everybody." Posted, detective agency. - I don't believe it. - No, you don't. No, you don't. Come on, get out of here. Never mind, get up, come on. Get in there. What's the idea? There they are. Ask them. Why did you do this to me, boys? We never told anybody that we were millionaires. Ha, ha. You see, Don said the show needed a little money. Yeah, and we had a little money. Yes, about that a little. Let's take it out of their hides! Yeah! Wait a minute, wait a minute. It's not their fault, it's ours for jumping at conclusions. Oh, stop this chatter. Throw those hams out of my theater. What business is it of yours? Because, I gave him the money you've been living on. Is this true? It is if can prove it. But the theater is in my name, and I'm taking over. What? Come on, get out, everybody! I got ya. OK. I'll be seeing you later, Bailey. You can't pay the money you owe me, so get these people off my property. And I thought you were my friend. I could kill you! And I'd like to do it for you. Wait a minute, Don, wait a minute. Let me do it. Let me do it. I'd like to kill him once for you. I'll kill ya myself, that's what I'll do. You can do this to that woman! I'll take ya, strangled ya to death, that's what I'll do! You... Ole, Ole, come on, Ole. Come on. Why you dirty... I'll murder the guy here in stealth view! See, that's what I'll do! I'll kill him, that's what I'll do. Hey, hey, hey. Why didn't you hit him? Well, I just didn't want to start a scene, that's all. Get 'em outta here, and save what you can. Girls, take those costumes right off, immediately. You're all fired. Ahem. Uh, uh, be careful with them, girls, too. Now listen... Well, that's that. We're closed before we opened. That ends it. We're through. Through nothing! We're just beginning. We'll open this show and pay that baboon off! Hey everybody, wait! Come here and listen to me. Come here, everybody. Hurry up! This ape is trying to take your jobs away, foreclosing on Miss Eldridge just because she owes him a few nickles. If you close this show now, you won't get a dime for your sets of costumes. Let's go on with it, and you'll get paid off in full. Suppose the show is a flop? Well, take a look at it. Give the girls a chance. Don't listen to him. You want to lose all your money? No, no, no, no. Well, we'll get her a chance. What do you say? It's all right with me. All right, then, we'll look at it. Come on, let's go. Oh... All right, everybody. Now on your toes. This has got to be good! Places. Joan, they're going to give us a chance. Then we're not fired? Of course, you're not fired. You're going to make this a show a hit! OK, get everything in place. Hurry up! You fellas are wasting your time. Well, it's our time. We can do with it as we please, can't... what are you talking about, wasting our time? All set? Yeah, all set. All right, folks. Do your best. Hark ye, hark ye, hark ye. Friends, for our first feature this evening we present that stellar attraction, Olsen and Johnson and Sally, the one and only singing seal! Well, Johnny, how do you feel today? Oh, I feel all right, Ole. Oh, what's the idea of the hangover? Ah, you didn't get home last night, huh? I'm supposed to say that. Yeah, well why don't you say it? You're supposed to say it for me. Well, that's what I'm trying to do. Well, I'm the dummy. No one's disputing that. And if you're going to continue sitting on my knee, you had better change your tactics. What? I say you better change your tactics. Well, where would I bleed? Oh! Where would I... And now, ladies and gentlemen, as our concluding number, we will smoke a cigarette, sing a song, and drink a glass of water all at the same time, simultaneously. You will double-cross me, will ya? You will double-cross me! Ain't we got blood? Sally, the one and only singing seal! Hey, what do you think about it, Bailey? Bailey? Oh, let bygones be bygones. Bailey? Something's the matter. Bailey! What's the matter? Oh, I don't know. What a time! Wait, wait. What's the matter, now? There's been an accident. What happened to Bailey? He's been shot. Shot? Yes, and he's dead! Oh! He's been murdered, the old man. Look, Ole, we knocked him out of his seat. Quiet. All right, now stay back! Stay back! That man's been shot. Shot? I'll bet I know who did it. Who? Sally. Sally? I saw her beat it, and she had a guilty look on her conscience. I know, you forgot to unload that gun again! Did I? Gun. Yes, and we've got to get rid of that gun quick. Hide it. No, you hide it. Poor Sally. Oh! Hey, what's the matter? Oh, you didn't see what I saw. Ah! Hey. What are you doing? I'm putting the gun in the fish. Now remember, mum's the word, and keep your mouth shut! I'm going to get the police. Yes, that's a good idea. Go on. Now then, there ain't no need of all getting het up here. There's been a murder committed, and the law demands payment. A killer is right here, because all the exits except the stage door were locked from the inside. Now here we are, and here we stay, until I finish my job, if it takes all winter! Now someone killed Bailey. Who did it? All right, speak up, who did it? Where's the guilty one? If you don't talk, I'll be compelled to use sterner methods. Hm! Hey, you want to try it? Take my end. What do you know about this? About what? The murder. Oh, well, you see... Hey, listen Officer, we don't know anything about this. Where were you when Bailey was shot? Shot? I thought they found him out in the alley with a knife in his hand. Who do you think poisoned him? I don't know, who? Nobody, he hung himself. Yeah, but how do you know he hung himself? How do I know? Why the gas jet was wide open. Well, was there much gas? Much gas? He was cut from ear to ear. Yeah, but did he bleed much? Every bone in his body was broke. He'd been in the water over 76 hours. Yeah, but was he dead? He was awful wet. I know, but was he dead? I don't know, he's going to phone and let me in the morning. Personally, I think it was suicide. Suicide? Wait a minute. Don't forget that I know a few things, too. Yeah, well I know as few as you do. Now look here! We're going to stay here all night until I find out who shot Bailey. Call me at 7:00, will you? You don't happen to have a pair of pajamas on you? Yes. No! Y... you can't let me in? I got in there! This is of grave importance. Inspector. Inspector, I don't know whether this means anything or not, but just before Bailey was killed I was at the stage door. Yes, yes? Well, two men came in, and one of them had a machine gun. What did they look like? Uh, th... they were about this tall, and had long, red beards, and they flew way out over the audience. What? Why are you... Shh! Get down. Get down! Look at that. Come on, Roger. Come on. Come on! Stop! McKee, they thing this is a joke. I'll lock them all up! It's up to us. Poor Sally. Hey, Chief, you can't do this. And I don't want any more of your double talk. We want to confess. Confess? Sally did it. Sally? Who's Sally? Oh, she works in the act. Oh, your girlfriend, eh? You've been keeping her undercover. What does she look like? Aw, she's got the most beautiful brown eyes. And the smoothest skin you've ever saw. Naw, how tall is she? Oh, she's about that tall, siting down. Standing up? When we give her a fish, she comes up to there. She wouldn't, by any chance, have a long, red beard down to there? No. But she's got whiskers like that. Ha, ha, ha. Say, are you trying to kid me? There might be something in what they say, Inspector. Sally is a seal in their act. And she did fire a gun. Where is it? I hid it. McKee, don't let anyone leave here. Right. Take me to it. No, Sally! No! No, no, no. No. Oh! What is it now? Sally swallowed the evidence. Oh, she did, did she? Well, that isn't gonna stop me. I'm going to take that seal to the hospital. And for your sake, boys, she better have the gun. And while we're there, I'm going to put you under observation, too. Hey, Murphy. Hey, Murphy, you're not going to let 'em operate on Sally, - are you? - Give us a break, won't you? A break? Yeah. Look at that trusting face. Look at those innocent eyes. I tell ya, I gotta find that gun. Oh, we'll find that gun for you. How? Leave it us. Sally will give us anything she's got. Whoa! Oh, oh! Whoa! Oh! I wonder what's become of Sally? She's gone for another ride. Oh, oh boy. Where's Inspector Murphy? He's coming. Why, Inspector Murphy. Oh, it isn't what you think it is. Those birds gave me the run-around. That seal didn't have any gun. Oh, we found the gun. You did? But it didn't kill Bailey. It wasn't the right caliber. Then I want to talk to that girl. Where is she? In the office with her boyfriend. I'll go to her. Uh-uh, this way. Mm, mm, oh! What are they doing? Let's find out. Just a moment, what's going on here? Nothing's going on. It's going off. We're shipping everything out of here. Oh, have a heart, old man. How do you expect us to put on a show without costumes or scenery? Why don't you broadcast it? You know, radio. Radio? Radio. Radio! Radio. Radio! I'm sorry, lady. It's... Will you stop it? I've got to get out of here. Oh! Oh, for Lord's sake. Uh! You mugs. Now who are we going to see? The head man. And nobody else will do. Good. If he turns us down, that will be final. Uh. Oh, of all the voices I've ever heard! But Mr. MacDougal! Oh, shot her off. Shut her off! Yes, but Mr. MacDougal. Oh! But Mr. MacDougal, she... she was sent to us by... Listen, I want the Cokes people to buy MacDougal's Mackerels, not frighten them into it. Yes, but Mr. MacDougal, now if you'd please be calm. Calm? Listen, I'm selling MacDougal's Mackerels. I need a program, something startling. A slap bang slogan. Well, we've got it. What do you think of that? MacDougal's Mackerel makes a marvelous meal for millions. Who are you? Well, we're not Amos and Andy. Ha, ha, ha. Oh, no, Listen, we'll give you an audition. Cute? That's just a sample. He's a genius. He can play anything! I've got a million of 'em. What will ya have? Rachmaninoff's prelude. I beg your pardon? Rachmaninoff's prelude. Yeah. Rachmaninoff's prelude. Rachmaninoff's prelude. Rachmaninoff's prelude. Would you recognize it if you heard it? Yes! Rachmaninoff's prelude. Give me another A. Give me a long A. Is that long enough? You heard what he said, didn't ya? Rachmaninoff's prelude. Oh! Rachmaninoff's prelude. Yes, and I'm going to play it for him. What do ya think of that? It's there somewhere, but you'll have to pick it out yourself. Rachmaninoff's prelude. Yes! When am I going to hear it? Right now! We'll make it up as we go along. Rachmaninoff's prelude , it's Rachmaninoff's prelude. And when it comes to preludes, that is quite a dish. Jonah's in a whale, Jonah's in a whale. I can't remember 30 days has September, but I never can forget MacDougal fish. Hey, hey, what's this? What's this? Hey, what's this? What is it? That's a school of little minnows. But just give me MacDougal's Mackerel, the health food with a punch. Oh, it's MacDougal's Mackerel for dinner and for lunch. Now doctors come and doctors go, but nothing is ever wrong. Vicious kings so loudly sing MacDougal's Mackerel song. Oh, MacDougal's Mackerels... You can swallow the fish and never taste it! You know the funny... Well, how did you like it? I think it's terrible. Hey! Oh! Is he a tough guy to sell an act to. Yeah, to sell him anything, you'd have to commit a murder. You're right! If it was your murder, I'd go for it! Oh, boy! We've got a murder. What? Bailey, at the Eldridge Theater. What has that got to do with the MacDougal's Mackerels? Oh, boy! What a tie-up. Our seal... And your face. Why, you tie up with that theater, it means publicity you couldn't buy. Who cares about the jinxed theater? What the public wants to know is who committed the murder? We know who did it. What? You know who the murderer is? Why, just wait a minute, wait a minute. You took his words right out of my mouth. That's what I've been trying to tell you. That we're going to disclose the murderer on your broadcast, produce him on the air! Sure! Millions of people with their ears to the radio. While, for the first time, there is broadcasted from any program the identity of the murderer from the scene of the crime! And brought to you through the courtesy of... MacDougal's Mackerels. Now, I told you to keep it down, like that. All right, let's get ready for a test. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Sour pickles, milk. Pickles? Milk? Pickles and milk? Why, this is a Mackerel program. I know, but we're just testing the mic. OK, George? Swell. What are we going to do, Ole? We don't know who the murderer is. Well, let's tell them the truth and face the music. Oh, Don, we... Don't tell me a thing. I was never so glad to see anybody in my life. Yes. He was worried, afraid you wouldn't show up. Well, why didn't you tell 'em. Oh, I didn't have a chance. Ole, Ole! Ha! We've got a packed house for once. Hey, you! Come here. What are you two guys trying to do? Make monkeys out of the police department? Oh, no, sir. Come clean, lugs. Who committed this murder? Well, you see, we... Just remember, that if you know and haven't tipped off the police department, you're guilty of a felony. What's that? A felony? Obstructing justice, aiding and abetting a criminal. 7 to 14 years. 7, that's 7, 8, 9, 10, 11... 14 years. Ah, ha! That's a long time, isn't it? 7 to... 7 to 14. Ha, ha. Inspector, I'm surprised at you! A man of your intelligence to fall for a gag like that. Ha! We have no idea who the murderer is. Oh! Don't say that I didn't warn ya. I should not. I'll tell everybody. Don't worry about that, officer. Look, why did you tell him that? Why, Mr. MacDougal! What a night, what a crowd! And when we get through, we will have MacDougal's Mackerel on the tip of everybody's tongue. Now listen, you crooks. You promised me the murderer and you're coming through with him. Understand? If you don't, I'll have ya jailed for taking money under false pretenses. Now, Mr. MacDougal, you don't mean to think that you... I just heard you admit you had no idea who it was. We don't. What? We don't think that it's necessary to tell the police all of our business. I put $50,000 into this broadcast. I've advertised it all over the country. If you make MacDougal's Mackerels a laughingstock, why, I'll break every bone in your body. I tell you... Oh, no. MacDougal, wait a minute. The boys know what they're doing. They say they'll produce the murderer, and they will. Won't you boys? Yeah, we know who he is. We know where he is. We've got our thumb on him all the time. Which thumb? Hey, come on. We'll just get back... I don't care... Listen, every... everything's going to be all right. I tell you, I don't... Now what are we going to do? We're going to take the first bus out of town. But we haven't got any money. Then we had better walk, because we can't hang around here. Yeah, but I hate walking. I've got an idea. You killed Bailey. Did I? When? No, well, you really didn't kill him. You're going to pretend that you did. Well, I didn't do it. I know it. But they can't prove it. Of course, they can't prove it. I think you got something there. Come over here. I'll tell ya just what to say. I'll try to make it a little bit more simple. All you've got to do, I take you in front of the microphone and you say, I killed him, because he was a rat. And I'd do it all over again. But I didn't kill him. I know you didn't kill him. You're just going to pretend that you killed him. Now try it again. I killed him, because I'm a rat and I'll... Now, no. You're not the rat, he's the rat. Can't we both be rats? No. OK, say I killed him. I killed him. There, that's it. But I didn't do... No. Wait a minute. Hey, try this. I... - I... - ...killed ...killed ...him... - ...him... - ...because... - ...because... - ...he... - ...he... - ...was... - ...was... - ...a... a... rat. Rat. That's it. Now try it. I killed him, because I'm a rat. And I'll do it again... No. Watch me. I killed him, because he was a rat. And I would do it all over again. Oh! You killed him. Well, it's OK with me. Come on. No! Oh, I don't want to do it. You've got me all mixed up. Oh, well, well, try it once again. Once again. He killed me, because I was a rat, and I'll do it again. No, no, no, no. All you've got to say is, I killed Bailey. I refuse to talk. You refuse? I refused to talk. That's what I did. Are you Olsen Johnson? Sure. Headquarters. The Chief detailed me to look after you boys till after the broadcast. Well, what for? We didn't do anything. Are you aware of the fact that your lives are in danger? You know that you're the only two men on earth who know who killed Bailey? Yes. Us and the guy that really killed him. Yes, and he's possibly out to get you before you have an opportunity to broadcast that fact. Why, you never told me that! Shh! Now listen, the Chief it sitting over there in the car, and he wants to talk it over with ya. Oh, sure. Sure, why not? We'd be delighted. There's no Chief in here. Here's the Chief, and he speaks six languages. Get in there! Come on, get in and quit monkeying around about it. I tell you, I don't trust them all. I'm sorry, folks, but we have to go on the air. All right, places, everybody. Places! MacDougal's Mackerels presents the MacDougal's Theater of the Air. The curtain rises on one of the most thrilling and unusual broadcasts in radio history. You are to be witnesses in the actual apprehension of a desperate criminal. A murder was committed in this very theater. Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, sometime during the next 30 minutes, the mystery of this ruthless killing will be solved here on this stage before your very eyes. Hey, Mary, it might be on the level. They're putting up policemen at every door. Come on, you lugs! Uh, huh. Well, here they are. Step into the waiting room, gents. Come on, boys, get going. Come on. Well, glad to see ya. Gentlemen, you'll live to regret this. Ha, ha. You should be so lucky. Yeah. Sit down. You ain't going nowhere. Yeah, go on, sit down. Make yourself at home. Now where's Spike? He's bringing in their baby. Baby? Yeah. What am I supposed to do with that sea serpent? How should I know? It went with the job. You can keep it for a pet. Ah. Baby, huh? OK, Slug. We delivered the goods to ya, they're yours. Can I do it now? Now, don't get over anxious. The boss will phone ya when. Sure he's got the number? Why, sure. Come on, my work's done. Come on. Oh, say... now, just be comfortable, boys. It, uh, it won't be long. Say, do neither of you guys play, uh, checkers? Yeah, I do. Oh, that's great. Well, we'll just have a game here all by ourselves, then! Have you seen Olsen and Johnson? Yeah, they went out in the alley a few minutes ago. Were they alone? No. They took that sea beast with them. Not so good. Well, your move. There. Hey, no kibitzing there. Oh, no, sir. No, sir. Hey, you can't do that! Make a move, then make it back again. Yeah, but he didn't take his nose of the checker. Yes, he did. No, he didn't. Well, he did too. He didn't! I say he did! Yeah. He did. Ah, what is this? That's the boss. Now don't move nothing! Hello, Slug? This is Phillips. Have you got, uh... Yeah, they're here, all right. All right. Go ahead. Take care of 'em, now. Sure. Well, what did he say? He said for me to go on with the job. Well, go ahead and get it over with. Ah, like fun, I will. You want to quit when you're winners, huh? Well, we won't do anything of the kind. Now go on, move. Good girl, Sally. What was that? Oh, I just said, I hope the game ends in a rally. Now it's your move. Oh! My men, huh? Cheating, huh? Now I am going to carry out the bosses orders. Which one you guys want to be first? You ain't got any preference, have you? Aw, you wouldn't think that you could... Aw, get together. We ain't got gonna draw on straws about this, you know. Alley-oop! What kind of a crack was that? Ugh! Atta gal, Sally! Atta gal, Sally. Hey, how did you get your hands untied? Why, I've had them untied all the time. Well, why didn't you do something? What? And get shot? Oh, here. Untie me. Answer that phone, and be careful. Hello. Hello, get me Slug, quick. Who? Oh, he's out. Hurry, we've got to get back to the theater. You've got to confess. Hello! Hey, what about Sally? We'll come back for Sally after I confess. Now it's every man for himself! Tell me, tell me! How did they get away? Oh, I don't know. I had 'em both dead to rights. And you know, them guys, they got a... uh, a trained seal with them. And when I wasn't looking, she snuck up in back of me and slugged me. You had better watch out, too. Because she's still around here, and she's liable to slug you. You sap! I've got to stop them. Well, you know, we'll have to make the announcement. Well, I guess this is the end of everything. What are you going to say? I killed him, because he was a rat. And I'll do it again. You've got it! Let 'em in. Hm! I'm a rat, and he killed me, and I'll do it again. What do you think of that? He's a killer, and I'm a ratter! Where is he? Ladies and gentlemen, uh, at the beginning of this broadcast, we promised to disclosed to you the actual murderer of William Bailey. Uh, we regret that we've been obliged to postpone this announcement until the finish of our broadcast. We... but let the men who handled this capture tell you in their own words. Introducing the master sleuths of the MacDougal's Mackerel hour, Mr. Olsen and Mr. Johnson. Now's your chance. Here we go. Get in there, boys. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. And now, we would like to have each and every one of you cuddle close together. We would like to have little children run to the protecting arms of their mothers, because I know that you all have been anxiously waiting to find out who killed William Bailey. Well, the time has come. He was a rat! No, not now. The killer is in this theater. He's right here! He's on this stage, and his name is... he was a rat! Get him! There goes the starter's gun, and they're off! In a cloud of dust, with the killer riding the rail, there they go around the first turn. The killer getting four shots ahead! There they go, into the back stretch! Get him! Look at 'em fighting. Fighting... it's rather hard to see - just what's happening over here. - Get him! Look at 'em, fighting it out for a blood-curdling finish! Just a few steps behind the killer, there they go. Come on, play something! My mistake, folks, my mistake. It was just a little surprise, because with a right cross to the jaw, they're aiming for the old whip master. Then down he goes for the count! One, two, three, four! He's up! At up at the count of three. He gets his screaming brides 19 yards... No, please don't. ...out of the first bumper, and then forced to punt. The ball goes past second base for a hit, kisses a nine ball, and lands in the side pocket. Through the courtesy of MacDougal's Mackerel. Get him! Come on, get him, boys! Come on! It was a beautiful take off, folks. He flew through the air with the greatest of ease, and was just about to make a perfect three-point landing, when he crashed. Through the courtesy of MacDougal's Mackerel. There's a lot of excitement here tonight, folks. And things are getting hotter and hotter. No, it's my mistake. They're getting colder and colder. Yeah, in fact, I think it's snowing. It is snowing. Right. Through the courtesy of MacDougal's Mackerel. Oh, what a night! What a storm! Storm? It looks like an avalanche. But does it stop us, folks? Does it stop us? Yes. Er, no. We carry on and on and on until we cry out, excelsia! Through the courtesy of MacDougal's Mackerel. There's the band, folks. There they go. There goes Kotchy Kobb! There goes Rachmaninoff! There goes Ruminoff. There they go, they're up... they're down. They're moving merrily along now, folks. It's barrels of fun! Ugh! Oh! Look! Let me down! I'm going to get... Come here. Oh, no. Let me go. Go back. Stop it! Let me go! Oh! Here we are, folks. And we've got nine trenchers on the very edge of death, as we bring to you this shot-by-shot description of the battle at the Eldridge Theater. Through the courtesy of MacDougal's Mackerel. Oh, ho, ho! Oh! Hurry, hurry. You've got two minutes to go. Two minutes to go, what a game, folks. What a game! The score is tied at six all, the killer has the ball on the five yard line. It's third down and five to go for a touchdown! Oh, and look at the blue. They are all tensely set, repeating in unison, thou shalt not pass. Thou shalt not pass! Look, the killer is down. He's in a huddle! Thousands watch his plunge. Look! What's the matter? I'm out of bullets. - You're what? - I'm out of bullets! Oh! The killer is going to kick! Ugh! Pardon me, folks, but due to conditions over which we have no control, we have to interrupt our broadcast. Uh, where was I? The killer! Oh, the killer. The killer, eh? Well, folks, we promised you the murderer of William Bailey. Yes, yes. The killer. Yes, yes, yes. Well, he's right in this theater, and his name is Peter Stuyvesant Phillips. Don! And remember folks, that the capture of this villain comes to you... Ha, ha, ha. Through the courtesy of MacDougal's Mackerel! And now we'll have a few words from the killer himself. Hello, Ma. I put up a heck of a fight, but I lost. And always remember, folks, that our motto is dependability. And on next Saturday night, at this same time, we will return with bigger and better surprises. So tell everybody, spread the news all over town! In the meantime, this is Olsen... And Johnson.
