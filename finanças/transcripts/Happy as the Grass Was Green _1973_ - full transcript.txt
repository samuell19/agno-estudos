When did they ship his body? Yesterday. [Man] Hotdog, something to drink, sandwiches? No thank you. (train whistle tooting) (train engine whirring) How come you weren't with us for one confrontation man? You know why, I've told you. Well tell me again I didn't think most of those demonstrations were helping, besides I was busy studying. You were studying while some pig was killing your brother? John and I went to New York to study Eric, that was the whole idea, now cool it. I know how much you love John, I loved him too. You're mad and you wanna fight, you won't get it with me.

Eli! Eli, Eli. It's good your home Jim, good your home. Eli, I want you to meet Eric Mills. He was a good friend of Johns. Eric, welcome. Hi. Let's get you home. - Everyone all right? - Yes, they're all right, they're waiting for you. How's Hazel? Fine, asking about you. It's been hard, since the news of John, nobody really understands. But it's corn picking time, there's lots of work to be done. They Amish? [Jim] Wenger Mennonites, a lot like the Amish. Thanks for meeting us Eli, take care. [Eli] See you tomorrow, glad you're home. Goodnight Eric. What's out there? Simon, the family graveyard. Simon? He was the oldest, then John, then me. He was killed in a tractor accident a few years ago. I've never been up there since we buried him. Welcome home son. Hi dad. Hi Jim, how are you? How was the trip? [Jim] Okay, where's mom? How are ya? - Fine momma, fine. Glad to be home. I forgot Eric. Sorry Eric. This is Eric Mills, he was a close friend of Johns. Pleased to meet you Eric. There's something to eat, you must be hungry. No thanks mom, we had a sandwich on the train. Just tired, Eric? No, I just wanna crash. I didn't make up the extra room, I didn't know. It's okay, I'll take care of him. No need to help with the chores tomorrow morning, meetings at 12, to settle on the funeral. I'll be up anyway. Goodnight. [Eric] Who's the little guy with the bald head? Ben, he works on the farm, sort of a member of the family. Never seen one of them close up before. (gentle guitar music) (machinery whirring) Good morning Mr. Mills, did you sleep well? I did thanks. Jim's out in the field with his dad. I'll fix you something to eat. (chickens clucking) Did he have many friends besides yourself? Yeah. He had a lot of friends. We loved him. Used to sing a lot. Yeah, he had a good singing voice, he and his brothers used to sing much together. Did he have a girlfriend? Yeah, well he had a lot of friends, both chicks and guys. But no one girl? No. No one. Well once I thought he'd marry a girl here. There was one. Hazel? You know her? Oh I heard Jim talking to Eli about some girl, and I thought it was probably- - Yes er, she's Eli's daughter. She's a good girl, smart, Jim liked her too. Do you want some more coffee? Yes please. In New York where did John eat? Oh mostly round the campus, you know, small restaurants, dumps. Why is there so much trouble in the cities, and with the army? Well it's very complicated. You'd have to er be there to understand. It should be simple, shouldn't it? The simple life is best isn't it? Well that's what we want. Simple things like you've got here. (whispered conversation) They're good people Eric, they don't mean to be rude, but you're- - But I'm a freak from the big city. In a way yes, you're something different. The way outsiders feel about them, something different. But they're good people, they just feel betrayed. Betrayed, by what? They knew John, and they loved him. They can't understand what happened. Well I can tell 'em, if they really wanna know. Politics and violence, they wouldn't understand that Eric. Jim, I'm sorry but I'm concerned about what some of them are saying. I hope we can have the service in the church. Thanks Uncle Jacob. What's that all about? [Jim] Because of the circumstances, the way John died, some don't think he should have a service set in the church. Oh for Christ's sake. [Jim] Eric, please try and understand. Who the hell do they think they are? [Jim] His people Eric. Yeah, well they didn't know him, I knew him. They didn't know him. I'm going outside, I gotta get some air. (door clattering) Too many Mennonites all at once huh? I guess. We're just people Eric. Judge us slow, this is a sad time. Leaves are falling fast now. Hey is Eli some kind of a holy man? A holy what? A holy man, a prophet. You know that isn't such a dumb question. Eli is a holy man, a man of God. He's a good preacher, he's my best friend too. Well I guess that puts you pretty close to God yourself then Ben huh? Do you like looking like a girl? Your hair, your hair? You don't mind looking like a girl? Know a lot of girls with mustaches Ben? Hey Ben! Look I'm sorry Ben, I'm putting you on. I don't think I look like a girl. But if I do so what, I mean I just don't care what people think. What's the matter? Menno mustn't see this, he knows enough already. This is awful. Oh what garbage! How could John do a thing like this, he was a Mennonite, a good boy. He worked on the farm with me, never hurt anyone. Now he's a criminal. Hey wait a minute John wasn't a criminal. He was killed by these goons because he wouldn't let them persecute another human being. John loved people. He was killed because he tried to help someone. He was violent. He was beautiful man, they were violent. He wasn't willing to sit back on his ass while people are being humiliated and thrown in jail. Oh man, what, what the hell do you know living out in this. God damn wilderness. You've got no right to judge anyone. No one. Know who the criminals are? They're the ones who sit back and do nothing. I don't believe the service should be held in the church. I don't think John should be buried in the family graveyard. Under the circumstances I think there would be more suitable burial grounds, and I say this with sadness, with due deference to my sister. Rufus, we had all agreed before you arrived. But I did not agree Eli, and I'm part of this family. We do not dispute your position Rufus. I've got no thoughts of vengeance, that's the Lords. But neither must we permit unbelief to be tolerated. John believed in God. There must be no weakness on the part of the church simply because the violator is a dear member of the family. John was, was violent towards people, and he destroyed property. We're talking here about God's word, and we must not condone those that violate it. I want the service held in the church. It is for all of us to agree, not just Anna and Me. Rufus, to avoid further discussion and pain, would you agree to this? A simple service beside the grave, but in the family plot. I'll agree to that. It is agreed then? It is agreed then. I guess you belong to the people who bury you. Uncle Rufus sounds like a real sweet guy. Yeah, we don't see him much, Christmas and Easter, important times like that. We'll fix John up real good Jim, he'll look fine. Thank you. That's Daniel Wenner, the undertaker. Wonder who they are? I'll go check it out, wanna come? (zipper rasping) Hi. What are you doin'? We're gonna take some pictures. You got permission? We're just gonna take some pictures. Yeah I know but, but, you should get permission. Look Mac, we're not bothering anyone are we? I don't know, but you should get permission before you take any pictures. - You live here? - No. No I don't live here. (photographer grunts) Okay buster, that's enough, now beat it. (man groans) (photographer screams) (fists connecting) (man groaning) (dramatic guitar music) (distant preaching) For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away. But the word of the Lord, endureth forever. Eight year ago, when I first came here, there were three Witmer boys, Simon, Jim and John. We called them Peter, James and John. And I came to love them as though they were my own sons. Four year ago we buried Simon, we came here then as we do now, and we wept and prayed, and tried to understand. Today, most of us have not wept nor prayed, neither have we tried to understand. (somber music) Hello Eli, you disappointed me. Why that boy doesn't even believe in the Risen Lord, and you spoke about him as though he were a Christian. You had a chance to speak out, you didn't. I do not believe we can judge Rufus, any of us. Surely you must understand this? I don't go along with a lot of this traditional mish-mash, wearing plain clothes and such like, but, but when it comes to the word of God Eli, the word of God, there must be no backing off. That boy was not saved, and he should not have had those words said over him. Poor Rufus, God was here and Rufus missed him. I wanna thank you, for what you said. For John. He would have appreciated that. Is that why you came here Eric? To make sure we buried him properly? We loved him too Eric, even if we didn't understand. I'm gonna stay here with Jim right now, I hope I see you again soon. I hope so. (somber music) Oh Eric, this is my daughter Hazel. Hazel, this is Eric, I've been telling you about. - Hello Eric. - Hi. Sort of stuck up isn't he? Well he is. Coming down to the house? No, not yet. You meet Hazel? Yeah. John really liked her, they'd have been married if he had stayed here. She couldn't go with him? You don't know us, he didn't ask her. She'd never have gone. What about you? Me and Hazel? Oh I don't think so. She comes on a little strong for me. He used to like to walk here, they were always together when we were home. I often wondered what that would be like John. To be so sure I would know what I should do. He loved people so much, I mean, really loved them, more then anyone I ever knew. And still he hated them. [Eric] He didn't hate people, he hated things that were done to people. [Jim] I wish I'd have been with him more, I wish I'd have talked with him more then I did. I remember one day, Simon and John and I, were up here fixing the fence. Simon said something about it was strange to love life so much, and yet be so close to the dead. John said, were as happy as the grass was green. Doesn't look very green now. (chickens clucking) [Eric] Hey Ben. Hey that's no way to walk in on 500 chickens, you'll scare 'em half to death. Well how else do you get in there? You knock, that's how. Oh yeah, you knock, then what do you do? Wait for one of them to say come in? Oh you're really funny, why don't you just watch, maybe you'll learn something. (knocking on door) I don't believe that. I bet there's a lot of things you don't believe. I do not believe it. Where you been anyway? Walking. Where's Jim? Oh he's up on the hill somewhere. Is that Eli's car? Yeah, meet his daughter yet? Yeah. [Ben] What do you think of her? I don't know, I couldn't see her, I had something in my eye. How you doing man? Okay. You know what Hazel asked me before the funeral. She wanted to know if John had to die, that's what she said, did John really have to die? What'd you say? Told her I don't know. Told her John wanted to change the world today, not tomorrow or next year, but today, and that's dangerous. She's here. [Jim] Who Hazel? Yeah, with Eli. Where's Dad? Oh he went for a walk with Eli, maybe. How's your eyes now Eric? Something wrong with your eyes? No. You really a hippy? No I'm a hippopotamus. (laughs) You don't have to act smart, can't you give a straight answer to a straight question? I'm sorry, there's nothing straight about me. (laughs) Stop teasing that girl now and get on with your dinner. Hazel was really giving it to you, but she can't take it. She likes things her own way. Yeah. Just like she's got a bonnie. She's just testing you. What's she testing me for? For strength or weakness, it's a game she plays, she likes the challenge. Yeah well, I wouldn't try anything under these circumstances anyway. I know Eric, I'm not worried about her. (metal clattering) I thought you should see one barn raising before we go back to the big town. [Eric] All right, just tell me what you want me to do, and where I go. [Jim] Here, right up the ladder. (hammers banging) This is fantastic huh. [Man] Yeah. Yeah, this whole thing, I mean it's just, just wild. It's fantastic. All you neighbors coming out to help another neighbor, it's incredible. I heard you the first time. What do you want me to do? You can um, put a row of nails up here, nail this facing into the back post there, about one every six inches, and put another row over there. You got some nails? - You Amish? - Hmm. (hammers banging) Hey, what's that? What? What you're chewing, what you just spat out there. Oh tobacco. - Yeah? - Uh-huh. Can I have some? (laughs) You? Yeah. It's pretty strong stuff. You like it? Hmm. My names Bart Byler. How are you, my name's Eric Mills. Yeah. (Car horn blaring) Well, it's about lunch time huh, you ready to eat? I just got here. [Bart] Oh, well that's good timing. (people chattering) Hey I don't wanna sound stupid, but what exactly is the difference between the Amish and the Mennonites? Well they both came from the same roots, ever hear of the Anabaptists? Yeah, 14th-15th century Europe. Girls getting burnt at the stake, all that jazz. Yeah well basically they, we are non-conformists. Rejecting the worldly world for the simple life. Yeah, what about your uncle Rufus? Well he doesn't reject things as much as he should. (Jim laughs) But the simple things are important. Follow the teaching of Christ, non-violence, brotherhood. But the Amish go a lot further don't they? I mean no cars, no electricity, what's that got to do with brotherhood? The further you get from simple things, the further you get from Godliness. Oh. Sarah, don't just stand there, there's plenty to wait on. Look out won't yah, the mans waiting for that stuff over there. Why'd they give her such a hard time? Who? - Her? - Who? She's had trouble in the family, she's a little strange. Oh that's logical. Both the Mennonites and Amish keep breaking up and forming new churches. As if they were always searching for the right things to do, they get caught in the middle of wealthy America. Some reach out, grasp new things, some hold on the, the old traditions. Some, most of the people, are somewhere inbetween. Some groups are afraid of falling behind the times, and another group is afraid of falling in with the times, make sense? Well it makes about as much sense as anything else in this world. But there's still something that unifies the whole thing, isn't there? I mean- - Hi. I didn't know you were leaving tomorrow. Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow morning. My father would like you to come over for supper tonight, could you? I'll drive him over. Uh yeah, I guess so. Okay, have him there at six. (Eric laughs) What were you preparing yourself for in college? English Major. But I'm more interested in politics. That's how I first met John at a political rally. What made you so angry? It's hard, being out here, where everything's so peaceful, everyone loves you, to know what it's like in the city. Like when I first met John, we were doing a demonstration to put pressure on the university and the city agencies to clean up this slum area near the campus. A little baby had been bitten by a rat the week before, and it died, and nobody cared. We moved in with the anti-war people, I mean it's the same thing. I mean killing is wrong, whether it's done with a gun or through neglect. The war went right up. A week later another baby was bitten, nobody did a thing. But why the violence? Our people weren't into any violence, not at the beginning. All we did was march and demonstrate, and circulate petitions for those guys who refused to be inducted into the army. The guys who had to go to Canada or wherever. But there was violence? Yeah, there was violence. See the whole anti-war movement began to fall apart once the draft ended. John couldn't understand that. I mean, we were still killing people, the cause was still there. Well we'd call a rally, and instead of 1000 kids showing up, maybe 50 or 60 would. See they hadn't really cared, about the killing. They just didn't wanna get drafted because they were afraid of being killed. Around about a month ago, John brought this guy in who'd gone AWOL about three years ago. Been on the run ever since then. He was really in bad shape. So we vowed to protect him. (people shouting) (people screaming) And then last Friday, last Friday I came home, (sirens wailing) And found the apartment house surrounded by cops, and the gang from the FBI. They're yelling for John to come out. No way. (gun firing) So the cops started pumping tear gas into the apartment. They broke in through the back door. And the next thing I heard, (gun firing) Shots. They claimed that John had fired at them first. Maybe he had. Anyway, John was dead. Are you ready for family worship father?

And remember, God loves you, don't settle for less. Goodnight. Hey give me the keys? - What for? - Give me the keys, come on, - come on. - What for? I've gotta go. Where you going? I'm going to Eli's. [Eli] The wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound there of. Thou can'st not tell whence it cometh, and wither it goeth. (car engine revving) Do you know what time it is? [Eric] I don't care what time it is. (car horn blaring) (dramatic music) (knocking on door) What are you doing here? I don't know. I thought I came to see you, but that's not it. And what would you have done if I hadn't waked up? Honest Hazel, I want you, really bad, but that's not why I'm here. I have to see your father. Earlier tonight, when I was here, love and hate were so mixed up inside of me that I just wanted to get up and run out of this house. But you didn't. And later on Eli, I kept hearing your children singing. I thought I was going nuts. I believe God is calling you son. (Eric laughs) I've found him. You're right, I found him Eli. I found him. (gentle music) You sure you wanna stay? Yeah, I'm sure I wanna stay, for a while anyway. Hazel got to you? Yeah, maybe she got to me, that's not all. Well I hope it's what you think it is. Just remember you're still a rare bird here with the Mennonites, but you're not one of them. I'm not sure you ever can be. Yeah, well I think you're jealous. (Jim laughs) Maybe I am, it's supposed to be my home. Take care friend. I'm glad he decided to stay here. Hmm? How long do you think he'll stay? Until the novelty wears off. What if the novelty doesn't wear off? (upbeat music) Come on. He's sort of a funny looking goof to have following you around. Well he's a nice boy I think, works hard now. Yeah, I guess. I wonder how long his conversion will last? I, I, I just meant with his peculiar background and all, I, we'll give him a chance. (stone scraping) Maybe he could cut his hair a little. Maybe? But I guess hair's his own business. Well I didn't mean real short. (hammer banging) (bright bouncy music) Hey, hold this sack. Open it. It's open. Your hair's still too long. Yeah, but I got rid of my mustache so you wouldn't mistake me for one of your girlfriends. (Ben laughs) This is the life my buddies in New York keep dreaming about, the simple life. Yeah, this is what it's all about. [Ben] Then why'd they go around blowing up all those buildings? Ben I've told you, they're angry because they see so much human misery around 'em. Shouldn't make 'em violent, but you gotta try and understand why they get that way. When you see a wrong, and you can't see any way how to right that wrong, then it makes you frustrated. I mean, how would you feel if one of your neighbors was hungry and you didn't have anything to give him? And no one else seemed to give a sh... Seemed to care. Now that's what you might call mighty fine bunch of cattle. Right. Oh come on Menno, you know good stock when you see it. Sure do. And a too high price for me, can't afford more then 35 cents. Menno look, you can't do this to me. Now I'm an honest man, now what have you got against those cattle? The price? (Ben laughs) 41 and a half, now that's the best I can do, even for you. Menno look, I paid 39 and a half cents for this cattle myself. Now what am I supposed to do? 39, that's my last offer. 40 and a half. 39. - 39 and a half. - 39. All right, 39. Pleasure doing business with yah, Shorley. (Ben laughs) Well that was a good boy, Shorley's fit to be tied. Hey, how much would you have paid? One cent more, it's worth 40 cents a pound. [Man] Hi Menno. [Hazel] I heard you stayed. I thought most girls didn't come to the stock yards. I'm not most girls. How'd you know I was still around? Why do you always ask so many questions? Me? First time we met you asked me if I was a hippy. Are you? What do you mean by hippy? All questions, no answers. I came with my father, he's doing some buying. I have to meet him soon. You wanna take a walk? Yeah. (bright gentle music) That's John's coat. Yeah, Mrs. Witmer gave it to me, it's a good old jacket. I didn't ask you if you were a hippy the first time we met. No. No the first time we met I said hello Eric, and you said hi, I thought you were pretty stuck up. Second time we met I asked you if you were a hippy. Oh yeah, I remember. (gate creaking) Ah there you are. I figured you'd found each other. Time to get home, see you Sunday. Bye Eli. Eric! I've been thinking about you, I'd like for you to say a few words at harvest service on Saturday. What about? Oh about the way you feel, your new walk with God. It would mean a lot to them and to me.

I forgot what I was gonna say, um, I, I didn't make any notes because I wanted the words just to come. And they're not coming. You see when I first came here, I thought I knew everything there was to know about Mennonites. I, I even thought all of you drove horse and buggies, and that some of you lived in monasteries. I want you to accept me. I found God here, because of the simple things I've found here. I've felt a peace. See before in my life, there was darkness, and now there's light. There was despair, and now there's hope. There was hatred, and now there's love. My name is Noah Dunbar, glad to have you here. Thank you. I'm Isaac Frederick, I liked what you said. (baby cries) I'm Mrs. William Stodder, and I just wanted you to know how please we are that you found the Lord.

Roger Martins, here's the address. (tractor whirring) (jaunty music) [Hazel] Here he is. Hey Hazel. Broke my leg. I started out 10 years ago with a little roadside fruit stand, and built it into this. The Puerto Ricans gave me some trouble, they don't like to work. You probably know what I mean, being from New York. As Christians we must help the unfortunate, even if they don't appreciate it. Carolyn, have Stanley come in will you. You know my sister speaks highly of yah, Anna's a good woman, and I respect her opinion. I'll be glad to give you a job here, most of the employees are Christians, except for a few, some that do the cleaning, people like that, but the Christian atmosphere pervades the whole business. This is Stanley, Stanley's our foreman. This is Eric Mills, we're gonna give Eric a job here. Help us with the Thanksgiving rush. It'll do you good to work with him. Glad to meet you Eric, I'm sure we'll get along just fine, follow me. I'll take care of him sir. 10 years ago this was little more then a roadside fruit stand, now look at it, built into this, fruits, and vegetables. We grow 'em out back, always fresh. I'm not a Mennonite myself, but I'm a Christian and Rufus and I get along very well. Here, fill these forms out and bring 'em in with you tomorrow. Er, what's a Christian hippy? Huh? Rufus said you were a Christian hippy, I was just wondering, that's sort of a contradiction in terms, wouldn't you say. Um no, not really. It all depends what you mean by it. I mean a lot of people appreciate nature. Nature, oh right yes. I like to go hunting myself now and then. Rufus never did well at school but he was always a go-getter. Not like a lot of us Mennonites, never did learn to be obedient. He was sort of wild in his teens, went to movies, and dances. Then one day he straightened up, he got changed at the Shepherd Hill Church. They're real liberal up there, and it's a sin some of the things they allow. Dress and things. They helped Rufus. Where's Ben and Menno? They're up the road visiting a sick neighbor they'll be late, so we'll eat. Now, go ahead and eat, you've worked hard all day. Were you born in New York Eric? No, Michigan, a little town near Pontiac. Oh. People travel far from home these days, makes it hard to come back. My grandmother moved across the road from one farm to another. And my mother and father lived 13 miles down the road from here. I moved into this house when I was married. Furthest away I've ever been is Washington, and Philadelphia. It was a few years ago, but today people travel far away.

They hurt other people and they don't even know it. You're Sarah? I remember you, you were at John Silks barn. It was nice of you not to laugh at me just now. I like you, I hope I see you again. And whatever they tell you about my father, it's not true, he was not a bad man. (thunder rumbling) [Hazel] It was nice of you to take her side, they're very mean to her. But why? Her father took his life last winter, she's been sort of strange ever since. So they laugh at her? I know, it's awful. Why'd her father kill himself? That's none of anyone's business, we don't talk about things like that. If you want to be accepted around here you'll have to understand that. (girls screaming) (people chattering) Hey come on, don't just sit there. I told yah, I only skated once before, I'll be out in my own good time. Are you afraid of falling? Of course I'm afraid of falling. Look why don't you go back and join your boyfriends. Oh haven't you met Marv or his brother. No I haven't met Marv or his brother, and I don't want too. Suit yourself. It's easier to skate fast then it is to stand. Right, skate fast. No standing. (Eric yells) Help! (dramatic comical music) Coming through! Help! (Hazel laughs) I want you to be one of the speakers at my church next Sunday. We're gonna put on a program that'll knock some people on their ears. I'm having three other hippy types, converted ones of course. They're gonna come tell us like it was really was in hippy land, and I want you to do the same. (singing in foreign language) (baby crying) (dog barking) (dramatic music) Stanley! Oh my hippy friend, I've been looking- - What are those people doing out in those sheds? Eric, shush for heavens sake, not so loud. Well why not? Puerto Ricans work for us in the summer, out on the fields in back. In the winter Rufus let's some of them who have no place to go, stay in those huts. You mean they stay out there all winter, Stanley it's 35 degrees outside. Eric shush, we can't talk here. Look, I was out there, I saw kids, it's reeking damp, the place is a dump. Puerto Ricans used to give us a lot of trouble, drinking and all that sort of stuff. Last summer Rufus got a hold of a Spanish speaking Evangelist and since then we've hardly had any trouble. They're very simply people, and Rufus charges them practically no rent. Rent? Only 40 dollars a month, you can't give these people something for nothing you know, they'll just take advantage of you. What's the matter with you? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm all right, I'm just trying to fight down a terrible urge to knock you flat on your arse. (banging on door) Eric? Hi, may I come in? Oh sure, come in, come in. Want some coffee? Um no. Take your coat off, sit down. I feel like everything's falling apart. Everything? I guess I just won't accept not being accepted. Are you sure you're not accepted. Oh I know you accept me, you accept everybody that's just the way you are. But I don't think Hazel accepts me, or Ben or Menno. I don't know maybe Mrs. Witmer does. Is it so important to you to be accepted? I found something here that I don't wanna lose. I don't know, myself I guess, and I just feel it all slipping away. Have our people changed? No I guess not. But, I'm losing the feeling of peace that I had, something's gone. Eli, did you know that Rufus had a bunch of Puerto Ricans living in some run down sheds behind his store? Yes. I know. It's a bad thing. Is that why you're angry? Shouldn't everybody be angry? We do not do so many things that need to be done. Rufus has not changed since you came here, Rufus is the same as he has always been, and so am I Eric. It's you who have changed. You cannot expect everyone else to change too. You've found a refuge here, not a home perhaps, but a refuge. You expect too much of us Eric. We disappoint you. (gentle music) You're not going to work today? Yeah, I'm just gonna arrive a little late. I'm all right. Just don't feel like seeing some of those people this early in the morning. Rufus has been fair to you? Yeah, I've got no complaints about the way he treats me. But something's wrong? Rufus has done or said something bad. It's hard to love someone when you don't like them, poor Rufus, he needs to be loved. But he's too proud to accept. Don't let Rufus make you angry again Eric, you can do so much good if you don't get angry. Dear friends in Christ, I promised you a rare experience today. Four persons, former hippies, who's lives have been spent in degradation and unholiness, have come here to tell yah how they were lifted from the clutches of the devil. Of their journey from the depths of depravity to this platform in the house of God. You can bring them in. (upbeat jaunty music) My mother began to drink. Right here ladies and gentlemen, you can see the marks of the needles. It was here, in this book. There was a God who loved me. Praise the Lord. A cloud was pulled away from the face of the sun. I was transformed. I was saved. Why do you people put other people in cages? You put us up here so you could sit down there and stare at us and feel superior. Now it's getting near Christmas, the message of Christmas is supposed to be peace and love, and brotherhood. Let's not build anymore cages for our brothers and sisters. No more Mennonite cages, no more Amish cages, no more hippy cages, no more Puerto Rican cages. Let's find the keys to those cages we've already built, lets open all those doors and throw the keys away. (gentle guitar music) You're going away aren't you Eric? I don't know, what are you doing here? I wanna go with you. Sarah. Look we can't stay here. I know a place, I'll show you. All right, but get down. Aren't you gonna come back and sit with me? I think it's better if I don't. I love you Eric, I really do. I know you think that's silly but I do. I don't think it's silly, but I don't think you love me like you think you do. Look Sarah, you've been hurt by your own people, and because you and I like each other, you turned from them, and you think you love me. I didn't turn from them, they turned from me, just like they turned from my father. One night about a year ago I, I had this terrible dream. I dreamed that my father was running through the streets shouting that no one loved him. The dream woke me up, I was scared, I guess I knew that papa was sad. He never could talk much to anybody, he was very gentle. But he could never say much to anyone. I went into my parents room and, my mother was there sleeping alone, and then I really knew why I was scared and I, I ran up the steps and I saw him hanging from the rafters. (Sarah sobs) (somber music) You're in love with Hazel aren't you? I'm not sure. Look Sarah, you wouldn't be happy away from here, and they need you. The people here need you. I know you might not believe that, but it's true. They need your strength, they need your honesty. I'll stay. But I'll write you okay, and let you know how I'm doing. I think if I can do that I'll be all right. Sure, I'd like that. (door slamming) (somber string music) Anna, I just got word from Jim, he'll be home for Christmas. Mum really needs a radio. She was really excited about you coming home. Yeah, she doesn't show much, but I knew she'd want me here. Hi Jim, it's great having you home at Christmas time. Hi Joe, thank you. Ma'am this boy was here first. I was here this morning, and that's first. You gave me the wrong plug. We don't have plugs at this counter ma'am. Oh yes you do, I bought it here. No we don't ma'am, plugs and that stuff's over there. Where's the manager? Over there. Some Christmas spirit huh? Yeah, everyone goes mad this time of year. Can you wrap this? Are you kidding? (bright tinkling music) Merry Christmas Eric. Merry Christmas Noah. - Welcome home Jim. - Thank you. Merry Christmas. (people chattering) What was that all about? Merry Christmas Eli. Merry Christmas Eric. Merry Christmas Jim. Merry Christmas. Did you hear about Eli and your old employer? No what? I guess Rufus had some poor people living in his brooder houses, old chicken huts at the back of his store. Now everyone's known about it, but no one ever did anything. I guess Eli went over and confronted Rufus in his office. What happened? Well I don't know for sure, but the brooder houses have all been knocked down, and I hear Eli has found jobs for the men. He must have scared the daylights outta Rufus. ♪ Oh come all ye faithful ♪ Joyful and triumphant ♪ Oh come ye, oh come ye ♪ To Bethlehem ♪ Come and behold him ♪ Born the King of angels ♪ Oh come let us adore him ♪ Oh come let us adore him ♪ Oh come let us adore him ♪ Christ the Lord ♪ Sing choirs of angels ♪ Sing in exultation I've gotta talk to you. I've gotta see you tomorrow afternoon. Tomorrow's Christmas. I know tomorrow's Christmas. But I gotta talk to you, I'm leaving tomorrow night. [Woman] Hazel, Hazel. Pick me up at three o'clock. (somber music) No, not here. Three o'clock tomorrow. Eric I want you to meet my cousins, Marv and Merv Berkholder. Hi. I thought I was seeing double. (bright festive music) Dad, can you give me a hand with the boxes of gifts, they're in the attic. You all right mom. Boxes of gifts, I hope everyone didn't go spending a lot of money. Oh I don't think so. (knocking on window) [Ben] That's our signal, let's go. How is it possible for a boy not to have one? What's wrong? Merry Christmas Menno. My, my, for me mom? Sit down now, that's what it's for you know. Eric picked it up for me at a sale, I made the afghan myself. It makes me sleepy. (laughs) He'd want you to have this. Where'd you get it? When I picked up his stuff at the morgue. He was wearing this when he was killed. I know. Thanks a lot Jim, I'll take good care of it. You know it's funny, not long ago seeing this would have made me so mad, I would have gone out and done God knows what. I've changed too. I think I've come home this time, I do belong here. Why don't you stay, you belong too, just give 'em a little time. No, no I belong back where this came from. I think I can do some good now. (Jingle Bells) We're ready, I'll get the turkey. You get the children into the kitchen. - Menno gave me these. - What? Menno gave me these. He gave me a cap too. (people chattering) Jim, good to have you home. Hi Uncle Dan, this is Eric. I remember, merry Christmas Eric. I think Jim'll stay a while this time. I can put him to work. ♪ All is calm, all is bright ♪ Round yon virgin mother and child ♪ ♪ Holy infant so tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace Turkey time everybody.

Continue to bless us with healthy bodies, we pray in Jesus name Amen. Amen. (all chattering) What exactly is the difference between a hippy and a yippy? A yippy? Yeah you know, you read about hippies and yippies all the time, what's the difference? Well, I guess it's sort of the same as the difference between an Amish man and a Mennonite. (Jim laughs) Boy Eric, you sure give good presents, those tools are all right. I'm glad you liked them Ben, have you seen Jim? Yeah, he's over by the door. Excuse me. (all chattering) Hi Eric. Eric this is Barbara Metzler, Barbara this is Eric I was telling you about. Hi. Look Jim, I've gotta duck out for about an hour is that all right? Sure, anyone I know? Could be. (bright gentle music) [Hazel] But you know all about me, about all of us, and we know nothing about you. That's not so. I, I bared my soul to your people. I came here a stranger, and now you know all about me. You're the one who never lets go Hazel. I know your father and your family, and I know what you look like, what you need and how you laugh, but I don't know you. I don't think I ever will. You're too private, you're too jealous, you're too sure of yourself, you're invulnerable Hazel, that's the way you are. No Eric you're wrong, I'm not sure of myself, not really, but I know who I am, where I belong. I don't think I'll ever leave, and I don't think you'll ever come back. Hazel! Eric has come to say goodbye papa. I'm sorry you're leaving. So am I. You've been an inspiration to me Eric, it's meant a lot to me having you here this long. Thank you. God go with yah. And remember he loves you, never settle for less. I was born here Eli. I heard about the brooder huts. Bye Eric, have a good trip. Appreciate your hospitality. You've been welcome, come back and see us again. Just some sandwiches for the train. Take care of yourself now. I will. All set, let's go. I'll be back shortly. It will be green again in spring.
