(multicom jingle) (mysterious music) - [Chuck] Walk proudly, all ye who pass through these gates for these are the gates of knowledge. They may lead to virtue or vice, to happiness or misery, success or failure. Or, as in this particular case, to corruption, to senseless random acts of violence, to vile and diseased sexual perversities, to nubile young bodies locked in the fervent pursuit of knowledge, stripping away the final vestiges of ignorance. Yes. Oh, yes. These are the rewards of higher education, the very backbone of our society. So walk proudly all ye who pass through these gates, for beyond them, a man may learn how little other men know. ♪ Busy in the morning ♪ ♪ Busy all day ♪ ♪ Got so much to do and no time to play ♪ ♪ He's such a busy boy, busy boy, runnin' around ♪ ♪ He's such a busy boy, busy boy, can't settle down ♪ ♪ He's such a busy boy, busy boy, he's coming down ♪ ♪ He's such a busy boy, spreadin' joy all over town ♪ ♪ And I'm all dizzy just wonderin' is he ♪ ♪ Ever gonna ♪ ♪ Ever gonna miss me ♪ ♪ Oh no ♪ ♪ Now he's passin' right by my door ♪ ♪ Oh no ♪ ♪ All the kids are laughin' ♪ ♪ I'm the girlfriend he's supposed to adore ♪ ♪ He's such a busy boy, busy boy, runnin' around ♪ ♪ He's such a busy boy, busy boy, can't settle down ♪ ♪ He's such a busy boy, busy boy, he's coming down ♪ ♪ He's such a busy boy, spreadin' joy all over time ♪ ♪ And I'm all dizzy just wonderin' is he ♪ ♪ Ever gonna miss me, just find the time to kiss me ♪ ♪ We never make affection, as time goes passin' ♪ ♪ I'm gonna be too busy for you ♪ ♪ He's such a busy boy, busy boy ♪ ♪ Oh, he's such a busy boy, busy boy ♪ ♪ Oh, he's such a busy boy, busy boy ♪ ♪ Oh, he's such a busy boy, busy boy ♪ ♪ Oh, he's such a busy boy, busy boy ♪ ♪ Oh, he's such a busy boy, busy boy ♪ - So after carefully weighing the pros and cons that higher education had to offer me, I realized that a degree in sociology with an emphasis on premenstrual activities of Aboriginal tribes women could pose a problem when it came to finding a real job. That's when I decided to become a rock and roll manager. Hey, my parents always told me, you gotta have something solid to fall back on. (knocking) Uh, Tweeter?

My ears are sensitive instruments, Duck. - Uh, it's Chuck. - Say, I wish you luck, too. - Yeah. Uh, listen uh, Tweeter? I was told that uh, you were the man to see about-- - Hey, hey, hey. Say no more. It's ESP time. Let me just tune in. Now, you... You manage a band. Am I right so far? And uh... You're looking to get 'em some work. (Tweeter laughing) Listen, Puck, you came to the right place. I record the sounds, I make the connections. I got a pilot tape in here somewhere. I got a bootleg tape in here on the Strawberry Alarm Clock jammin' with Jerry Vale. Have you got any idea how much that's worth? - Listen, Tweeter, um, about my band, they're three girls, they're called The Splitz. - Listen, everything's gonna be sweet, 'cause you came to the Tweet. I can make you big! (twinkling music) - Hello, all your fame fans. We're backstage with The Splitz. Just another college rock and roll band with a dream. But all that could change tonight, because tonight, these girls will be appearing at that marvelous new hot spot... Hey Joan, where'd Chuck say he booked us at? - He hasn't said. If he doesn't get here soon, he'll be booking me, all right. On manslaughter. - Hmm, well, yes, ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, the atmosphere here is charged, mostly because the girls couldn't afford cash. Well, why don't we talk to the drummer of the band? How about that, folks? What are you reading, Susie? "You Are What You Chew"? When are you gonna give up on this health food bullshit? - Look, I happen to believe my body is a sacred temple. - Gina's body is more like the corner store. Open 24 hours. - Well, at least mine's not a drive through, honey. - Rawr. - Hey, Chuck! - Hey, Chuckie! - Hold your applause. (girls cheering) Come on, I'm not ticklish. I'm not ticklish, come on. Come on, come on, sit down, sit down. Cool-cool your jets, cool your jets. I got good news! Good news. I got the job. - All right! - Yay! - This could be the big break we've been hoping for. - Break, schmake. I was hoping for roadies. - I-I realize that things have not gone exactly according to plan in the recent past. - Oh, you mean like that supermarket you booked us for? - The opening act for their new three-ply toilet paper? - Okay, okay, okay. But the important thing is tonight, because tonight, you're gonna be up there on that stage. Tonight, you're going to be up there mesmerizing the audience with your sound, with your sensuality.

I don't recognize the species but I think it likes you. - Some guy named Warwick from psych class. What's he doing here? (wood breaking) - Decoratin', for one thing. (plaster clattering) Wait, he's trying, he's trying to communicate. Three words. First word... Sounds like snot? Hot, he's hot for you. He'd do anything for you. Damn, I didn't know bulldozers even had mating seasons. Wait, he's getting up. It's coming closer. It's opening its mouth. - Hey Susie, want to go to the World Series with me? I got tickets. My treat. Susie? - What can make a person behave this way? - Susie, let me take you away from all of this. (growling) Where's that peckerhead manager of yours? - Warwick, if we get to him before you do, there's not gonna be nothing left you to break. (door breaking) (zipper zipping) (toilet flushing) - Warwick? Oh. I'm glad to see it's you, and not one of those dangerous animals out there. - Your drummer just gave me the finger. - Well, W-Warwick... Susie gives everybody the finger, you know? I mean, that's, that's her way of saying uh, how you doing? So h-how you doing, Warwick? - She refuses to go to the World Series with me, and I got tickets. - Well, uh... Don't take it personally. I-I mean, you know, maybe Susie doesn't like baseball. But if you want someone to go with you, I'd be happy to-- - Look. Either Susie goes out with me or I'm gonna personally flush you down a toilet, limb by limb. - Warwick, give me a break, okay? I just manage the band, all right? I don't run their personal lives. - You know, you make a reasonable point there, Chuck. I'm being irrational. You're not the object of my anger, I'm merely displacing it on you because well, because you're convenient. It's my own sense of inadequacy that disturbs me. Now if I'm gonna deal with this thing maturely, I'm just gonna have to handle it all on my own. - Those are wise thoughts, Warwick. - Yeah. Hey, sorry, Chuck. - [Chuck] Surviving Warwick and an S and M obsessed parrot was easy compared to dinner at Gina's folks the following day. - It's 5:56, something's happened to her. - No sign of them yet, boss. - Louie. Louie, you gotta look through the blinds, Louie. Not at 'em. I know something's happened to her. I can feel it in my bones. - For God's sake, Vito, she's five minutes late. What could happen in five minutes? - What could happen in five minutes? I'll tell you what could happen in five minutes, Rosa. Bang! How long did that take? You know something, Rosa? ever since I went legit when I moved to the country, I got a nice house in the suburbs now, right? All I do is worry. Before, before, when I was killin' people, I never worried. I need a drink. Somebody give me a drink around here, will ya? Come on, come on, get me a drink. And you? What girly magazine you reading now? How's the stock market? Anything going up? (Vito laughing) Vinnie, there's a young girl here to see ya what a big set of knockers. - Where? Where? Is my hair okay? Uh, we talkin' really big? We talkin' like '58 Cadillac bumpers, you know? - God, my stomach. Something's happened to my Gina, I know it! God help me, something's happened, I know it! - Vito. Why don't you go upstairs and take a crap? You know how that relaxes you. - You're absolutely right. Rosa, what the hell would I do without you? - [Chuck] How about learn to control your own bodily functions? (upbeat rock music) Meanwhile back in college, the girls and I were drumming up a little school spirit at the event we've all been waiting for. Hooter College Sorority Day. - [Gina] Chuck, we gotta go. My dad can be very nasty if I'm late for dinner. - Rumor has it, they do nasty things with pom-poms. - [Gina] No, on Lois, I'd say more like obscene. - [Chuck] Well, it's Sigma Phi. Is it to your liking? There's always Fern Hymanstein in Delta Phi. - Okay, now we're gonna do a little upper torso action. We're gonna go to the right, center, and left. Let's get those breasts right out there-- - Get a load of Fern's chest. - Right, center, left, center. Right, center-- (Chuck chuckling) - She's got more padding in there than defensive lineman. - [Fern] Right, center, left, center-- - Hi. I was wondering if you might consider me for your house? Well, my sister was a member in '72. - Yeah? Did you hold any athletic records? Any awards? - No. - Ooh, how chic, designer label! (girls laughing) Why don't you go check out the next house, Phi Beta? (girls laughing) - Mary, would you stop crying, for God's sake? I mean, what are we? A bunch of self-defeatist wimps? (crying) Come on! Let's show a little team spirit! - This wind's gonna destroy my hairdo. Do I like all right? - Oh, come on, I need three girls to run! Let's show some team spirit! - I can run. - Oh! (girls laughing) - I'm Bernice, and I can run. I-If you want me to. - That's the spirit! Welcome to Phi Beta! (dramatic music) - [Chuck] Dean Hunta. - Good. - What is she, a nazi in heat? - Runners, get your spikes on! Let's go, first down!

Just then though, all I really was looking forward to was a terrific home-cooked Italian meal. I mean, two things I have a passion for; Money and food. I'll eat anything, except fish. I hate fish. Ever since I was a kid and my older brother put live Guppies in my soup, w-what do they call it, psychological scarring? I mean, I had nightmares about Guppies spawning in my stomach for weeks. (firecrackers popping) - Hit the deck! - Oh, Gina's home! - Gina, baby, you're alive. - [Louie] They're all clean, boss. - Still in one piece, sweetheart. - Yep, still the same piece I was last time you saw me, dad. - Listen, I want to thank you. I owe you a big debt of gratitude for bringing my daughter home alive and in one piece. Grazie, grazie. - Dad, this is Chuck, our manager. - Manager? What's your percentage? - Oh, don't start. Can we eat first? Uh... - Oh, yeah, sure, sure. Come on. - [Gina] Uh, Chuck, this my mom. - Nice to meet you. - Hi, Chuck. I hope you like fish. - I love fish. I love it. I've been eating it since I was this high, you know what I mean? Guppies. Right, right, you name it. - What's with the routine? Are you auditioning for a talk show? Thank you God, for protecting me one more day from being poisoned, stabbed, gunned down, run over, had my head broken, and fitted for cement shoes. And also God, thank you for taking good care of my family and keeping them in good health. Amen. Yes, all except Vinnie. Amen, over and out. - Uh, Vinnie, this is Chuck. Chuck, this is my cousin, Vinnie. - How you doing, Chuck? It's a pleasure, I'm sure. - Uh, you sure you got enough on that plate to take care of your girls in the magazine? (Louie laughing) So, Mr. Manager... I'm a businessman. I'm in the fish business. Frozen fish. So let's talk tuna. I gather that you are a businessman too, because you represent my daughter Gina, who is terrific at everything she does. Right, Gina? Now, listen, uh... We should talk percentages. I mean... What percentage, uh, do you take? Uh, how much fish do you swallow? You take 50%? Maybe you take 10%? - Uh... Yeah. - Or-or-or maybe it's only 5%, hmm, hmm? - Yeah. - Or maybe just a teeny, weeny, tiny little percent? (men laughing) (Chuck coughing) - Oh my God! He's choking to death! And I got jello mold for dessert! - [Gina] Oh, ma... - They poisoned the wrong plate... - [Chuck] So while I resumed my Guppy nightmares and Gina's father debated about ways to fry the family's competition, the demonic Dean Hunta was planning a little clambake of her own. - Girls, you have made your return to school this fall a most enjoyable one for me. Seeing that rodent from Phi Beta eat dirt... - Was well worth the wait? - Shut up! (intercom buzzing) - Dean Hunta? - What do you want, Karl? - [Karl] The fat one's here. (Karl laughing) - I thought I told you never to use that word! - [Karl] Ah! (Karl speaking foreign language) You disgusting witch! You miserable hippopotamus! You almost broke my-- - You're late. Sit down! As you have already probably guessed... There is a lot at stake here. (girls laughing) One of your sorority houses must go. Bite the big one. One of your houses must be torn down, for a new sewage treatment facility. So we will have a little athletic competition. There will be three events. Soccer... Wrestling, I especially like that one. And basketball. The first house to lose two events, Phi Beta, will be the one to go. And don't forget. Friday, we'll see you on the soccer field, eh? My little pudgy Pele? (Fern laughing) Now... I don't give a dead rat's ass how you do it, you just make sure you win. - Dean Hunta-- (thunderclap booming) (slide whistle whistling) May, may we ask you a question? - Well, ask the goddamn question. - Well, it's just that we were wondering, why do you hate the Phi Beta Sorority so much? Is it something buried deep in your past? Some dark secret that you've carried with you all these years, like an unhealed scar? - No. It's just another example of senseless random violence perpetrated against the underdog. - Oh. Well, that clears that up. - Now get out.

I'm really scared but-- (drums rolling) - [Fern] Oh! - [Chuck] Well, the Phi Betas may have lost a soccer game, but they gained an all-girl rock band. Now we were really in it, up to our necks. - Hello, pain fans. We're here at the emergency ward of Phi Beta General Hospital to find out what physical torment is really like, to get the inside scoop on suffering. Um, can we come in a little tighter on this broken arm? Uh, excuse me miss, would you tell our viewers what it feels like to have your own personal arm broken into itty-bitty little pieces? - Oh! - Many of our viewers have written in to ask what actually happens when a person with a broken leg suddenly loses his or her crutch. - [Girl] Oh! - There you have it, folks. And remember, you saw it here first. Come on everybody, lighten up. Things aren't that bad. Tomorrow is another day. - You know what I wish we could do? - Drugs? - I want us to trounce them in the next event. If we could find someone, someone who'd be willing to work with us day and night-- - I have somebody who would love to help. Of course, he drools a lot. - All right girls, now listen up. Now I understand you want someone to come in here and train you all right, get you all into shape, and that's exactly what I intend to do, get y'all in shape. And it's not gonna be easy. Now the first thing we're gonna do is runnin' in place. Does anybody know what happens when you run in place? - You miss the bus? (girls laughing) - All right you, with the fat lip, give me 10. - Oh, all I got's 20, coach. - I said give me 10 pushups! - You jerk! - All right, the rest of you. Now, do as I do. Running in place. Swing your arms. (upbeat music) Now lift your knees as high as you can. That's right, come on now! All right everybody, running in place, that's it! In place, let's go! Get 'em up, get 'em up there! Spit out that gum! Come on now, higher, higher! Come on now! I said get 'em up, get 'em up! Come on, get up! Get 'em up! Get 'em up there! Get up, lardo! (sighing) Okay girls, for your upcoming wrestling match, the first thing you gotta learn to do is keep your opponent's shoulders pinned for a three count. Now, do I have a volunteer? You, Susie. ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Who cares what people say ♪ - Now, you be my opponent. Lay down on the mat. Now the thing to remember is you've gotta keep your opponent's shoulders pinned for the count of three. The full body press is best. (Gina chuckling) One! I love you, Susan. (girls laughing) Two! If you marry me, we don't have to do it every night. I promise. Three! Get up. Come on Susan, get up. - Hey, I think you squished her to death. - Wait, I think she's coming to. - She's coming to? (chuckles) Well, we all know Warwick did, but Susie? (girls chuckling) - Okay, wise guys, 50 laps! - Warwick's heart was in the right place, even if his brains were just below his belt. And since Crusades seemed to be the order of the day, I found mine in Gina's cousin Vinnie, who's masculine self-image was in pretty bad shape. Why is everyone so negative about uh, introducing you to a few girls? - I don't know, it's gonna sound crazy, but nobody will fix me up with anybody. I mean, Chuckie, look at me. Look at my face. Not like a queer, nothin' like that. Like, like you look at Steve Reeves in the movies, like Hercules, you know? I'm a nice looking guy, right? I'm-I'm a good lookin', I'm handsome, ain't I? Seriously, huh? My cousin Angie called me a supple little hunk, you know? Let me tell you a little story, huh? I'm at the bus stop the other day. Me and this girl, I'm not bothering nobody. I can see her looking at me out the side of her eye. I'm not botherin', you know? She comes over to me. She says, "Excuse me, what time is it?" Anyway, I say to her, I says, "Look, why don't you come over to my house, "we'll sleep together, bada-boom, bada-bing, eh? "Then I'll buy you lunch." She smacks me. She smacks me! You know, I offered to buy this chick lunch, she's calling me names, walking away. Smacks me! - Yeah, okay, okay, settle down, Vinnie. - Nothing, huh? - You settle down, Vinnie. Vinnie, Vinnie, why don't you read something? Why don't you read this? Why don't you check this out there, Vinnie? See there, hypnotism and lust. Uh, mind control and the macho man-- - Chuckie, baby, that's not a bad idea. - I can't take it. I can't go on. My heart, my lungs. Everything's gone black. - Is she passing out? - I mean it, you guys. My body can't take it. - You're right. This is just not gonna work. We have to think of a way to get to Dean Hunta. (locker doors slamming) I'm thinking of doing something really low, really mean, and really sick. - Like a blind date with a business major, maybe? - Something even more vicious. I'm talking about... I don't know... Blackmail. If we could get something on her, something that she wouldn't want spread around, then we could win. - You mean, like the fact that her husband's a pervert? - Pervert? - Well yeah, he's our family dentist. He asked me if I wanted gas, and he told me to open wide. - So? - My mother had the toothache. He's a lousy dentist too. You wanna see these caps? - Check it out.

I don't know. I guess it'd be kind of uncomfortable, but I bet the guys get a kick out of seeing her in them. - Shove 'em, you asshole! - Oh, by the way, the red panties were Hunta's idea.

I think I got something here. Let's see, how to pick up in a supermarket. Produce, produce. Here it is, yeah. Mmhmm. Look cool, got that. Handsome. - [Manager] Attention shoppers, this is the manager. Would the owner of the blue Datsun please remove the vehicle from the receiving lane? - You're dead, lady. - [Manager] That license plate number, U, D as in dumb, P as in putz, four, oh, nine. The rear end is protruding. Thank you. - So uh, come here often? What's your sign? Yield? (chuckles) just a little joke, kind of break the ice. - Drop dead. - I wish you hadn't said that, but look, how are you supposed to know I only got... 48 days to live? - What? You only have 48 days to live? - Well, 51, countin' legal holidays. So look, it's been nice knowing ya. And uh, I'm in the book, huh? - You know, you look perfectly healthy. - Nah. Not when you look close, I don't. You see in my eyes, I got these kind of tiny little squiggles, you know? Kind of like designer labels, you know what I mean? - I don't see anything like that. - You can't see it from there, you gotta come in a little. Yeah, that's it, you see? Right, right in there. Look deep into my eyes. See what I mean? Real deep. That's it yeah. - Like this? - Yeah, yeah. That's it. You're feeling very relaxed now. Very relaxed. Very shit-faced. (upbeat band music) (crowd cheering) - We got this one! Let's go baby, come on! - [Chuck] Well, it was high noon at the Hooter funny farm. The final event, basketball, was a sell out. And since our very own Joanie was an experienced high school ball player, no need for us to worry, right? Wrong, dead wrong. - Listen, you fat face. I told you no spectators at this game! - Well, I guess Chuckie did get a little carried away with the tickets. So, are you looking forward to playing basketball in your birthday suits, girls? - [Fern] What? - The name of the game, baby; Strip basketball. Very simple. You make a basket, we take something off. We make a basket, you take something off. - You're crazy. Listen, Hymanstein... You're not getting us involved in this. This is yours and Scagliani's fight. - Listen, everything's been taken care of. Their only player who can even hold a basketball won't be able to make it to the game today. (harpsichord music) - I'll be with you guys. - Now! - Hey! (Joan yelling) What are you doing? Oh! What the, stop it! Ow! Hey! Hey! - Besides, if we lose, that's the end of Delta Phi. And that means every one of us. - You better be right, Hymanstein. - I'm always right. (chuckling) (crowd cheering) - Okay, girls. You know the rules. No dirty stuff. No pullin' the face mask. No hittin' below the belt. And the most important rule; No radio play, okay? Okay.

I did not know how much I would regret the following day. - You do not know how much you will regret this meeting today. I have tried to understand these recent events. To reason them away as an aberration of youthful energy, perhaps. Absurdities conceived in an impetuous moment. - Christ's sakes, will you just get to the point? - Yes, the point, Napolioni. The point is, you're out. All of you. This college will no longer tolerate your insolence, your vulgarity, your moral degeneracy, your kind. - Now, wait a minute. Okay, you can't just kick the girls out like that. - Oh really? What makes you think you're excluded? - You're shittin' me? - But Chuck's got his full scholarship. - Jesus. And that's unfair, even for you. - It is my ambition to be unfair. (dramatic music) - [Chuck] Well, I gave it a shot. So before finding the nearest tree to hang myself from, I decided to say goodbye to ol' Vinnie. Even if I hadn't done myself or the girls any good, at least I'd managed to do him some. - You know, sometimes I worry, I think maybe you only like me because of my tremendous power. I tell you something, Madeline... People like you make this a great country, you know? I... (knocking) Talk to you later. Uh, coming. Uh, come in. Hey, Chuckie, baby. How you doin'? Hey Chuck, grab a helmet, huh? Okay, girls, formation. Good morning, ladies. Chuck, I got somethin' a little special, been working this for a long time. Today's the big game. Come on out here. We got something in a large, in case you're interested in, from the University of pec, pec, pec, work on those muscles. Hey Chuck, I got good news for you. Good news. There's more! (Vinnie laughing) Chuck, you're gonna fly for this one. Come on out here, you sweet, yeah. Yes, mmm, mmm, mmm. Ooh, you animal. Hey Chuck, you know the fine line between pleasure and pain? Watch your skinny elbows. Yes you are, tuna fish face. Com here, you. Hey Chuck, baby. Chuck, uh, see if you can pick me out in this crowd. (Vinnie growling) Hey, what about the captain of the football team? What do you say we bring her out, huh girls? What do you say? Numero uno. Stay right there, I'll be back, excuse me. (Vinnie chuckling) From Scandinavia, frozen and flown here immediately, Pia of the North, huh? God bless. Hey Chuckie, I know what this must look like to you, I mean, all these half-naked, hypnotized Hooter College freshmen, but, you know-- - Vinnie, I gotta talk to you. - Now? Hey Chuck, forget about it, huh? - Come on, Mean Joe, before they put you away for life. I want to talk to you. - All right, uh, girls, uh... Time out, huh? (Vinnie chuckling) - I got kicked out of college. I mean, as a matter of fact, so have the girls, but I lost a full scholarship, man. Two years down the drain. - Hey Chuckie, let me tell you a little story. I had a friend, Joe Bagadonuts-- - Vinnie, spare me the story, okay? - Don't let it get you down. - Down? I've hit bottom, man. I mean, first of all, I get the band booked in one of the all-time shit bars, and then somehow we get involved in this fight between the Dean and the stupid sororities, and next thing I know, I'm kicked out of school. - You don't need school to be a rock and roll manager. - Yeah, some manager, right? I can't even find a bar for my band to play. - Yeah, it's pretty tough, huh? Maybe I could help you out. Maybe uh... Maybe Louie and Tony could, you know? - Louie and Tony are not gonna do me any favors. - Hey Chuck, you want to get your band booked or what? Hmm? Louie. Tony. Come in here. - Hey Vinnie, there's some dame pointin' somethin' at ya. - [Vinnie] Listen uh, how'd you like to help Chuck's band get a club? A genius band. - Consider this. We knows a guy, who knows a guy, who owns The Palace, the biggest club in town. And when we take a job, we never slip up. - Okay, it's settled then. You guys go get the job done, huh? Hey Chuckie, you see that, man? Lighten up, huh? Lighten up and get your mind off all this damn stuff. Look, there's nothing like a little sweet revenge to get the old blood flowing again, huh? Hey Chuck, I don't know this Dean Hunta. But let me tell you something. She's about to mess with Vinnie Mamabasta. ("Ride of the Valkyries" by Richard Wagner) - [Karl] Hey, Hunta! - This had better be important, Karl. I told you I don't want to be disturbed. - [Karl] I know you don't want to be disturbed, but let's face it, you are! (Karl laughing) - What the hell do you want? - [Karl] A gentleman to see you. - I told you, I don't want to see anyone. - I say that today's educational standards are a disgrace. I say that unless every student in this college has the opportunity to read the likes of Wilbur Wilbur's poetry that the very moral fiber of our country will disintegrate. And moral fiber is very important. It keeps you regular. Anyway, with poetry as brilliant is this, "I live to love, my love. "I used to laugh, my love. "Is that a laugh and a half, my love? "Because I live to love my calf, "so do not laugh"-- - And this is a gun. Nobody reads poetry that bad and gets away with it. - Okay, okay. So you didn't like that one. Hey, I remember one that goes something like this. Uh, deep into my eyes, she looked. Deeper and deeper. Very deep. Her eyelids got heavy. Very, very heavy. Very, very heavy. You're a sittin' duck, Deanie. (Vinnie speaking foreign language) (Vinnie chuckling) Jeez, did you have me scared for a while with that firearm. (chuckles) I thought I was gonna wet my pants. Speaking of that, I gotta drain the old Mamabasta monster, you know what I mean? Oh first, I gotta give you the instructions, yeah. Um, let's see uh... When you hear words I gotta take a leak, you will fall into a deep trance, all right? I gotta take a leak. - I gotta take a leak... - You will remain in that trance until you hear loud applause. - Applause. - I gotta go. Thanks for so much, huh? (dramatic music) (knocking) - [Louie] Knock knock. - Who's there? - [Both] Louie and Tony. - Louie and Tony? Why didn't you say so? Come on in. (typewriter clacking) Hey, you're not the Louie and Tony we know. Those guys were young, and good-looking. And they never dressed funny. And they're doing time at Sing Sing. - Listen, we came here to introduce ourselves. I'm Tony, and this is my associate, Louis. We came about The Palace. Mr. Napoliani has a daughter in a band. They want to play The Palace, this Saturday night. - No how. - No way. - No dice. - No shit. ♪ Nobody knows the trouble I've seen ♪ - Dad! Dad! And neither of us are gonna make no deals with no guys pretendin' to be Louie and Tony. Hey look, even if you was Louie and Tony-- - [Mack Sr.] Which you obviously ain't. - That don't mean you get The Palace. - Even our best friends, they don't get The Palace. Our friends, they beg, they threaten. But this, this is a very tough business. Look at my kid here. He's only in the first grade. - Listen. I will show you how far Mr. Napoliani will go when somebody refuses to do him a favor. (glasses breaking) - Louie, not on your own glasses. - Hey. Do that again. Stomp the glasses. (glass crunching) Louie! Louie! It is you! My long-lost cousin, Louie! Sing Sing may have destroyed your good looks, but no one can take away those twinkle-toes of yours. Dance, Louie! Dance the way you danced the night of my wedding! (upbeat swing music) (Louie scatting) And Tony! You still got the breath of a squid, but I love you, cuz! Mwah! - What do you say, cuz? Do we get The Palace? - Sure, say no more! (Mack Sr. laughing) Mack, get the contract! Say the word, and The Palace is yours! - [Chuck] Meanwhile, my higher education was about to pay off with the most diabolical scheme ever to come from a guy voted by his senior class most sincere, most intellectual, and most likely to become a father before his time; Moi. Is Dean Hunta there? (thunderclap booming) (phone buzzing) Hello, Dean? Uh, this is Jeff Stone from the Hooter College Special Projects Committee. Yes, yes, it's very new. Um, yes, well we're having a special benefit show this Saturday night at The Palace. It's to help the Hooter College football team raise money for new Nautilus equipment, and we'd like you to be the guest speaker. Yeah, it's just about two or three minutes to uh, open the festivities, if you would. The entire school board will be there. You'll do it? I can count on you then? Well, that's great, Dean, thanks again. So we'll see you this Saturday night. Okay, bye Dean. (thunderclap booming) (phone buzzing) (drums rolling) (upbeat rock music) (club patrons conversing quietly) Okay, you girls just stay right here, okay? And whatever you do, don't miss the warm-up act because uh (chuckles) it's a killer. - Wait a minute, Chuck. I thought this was supposed to be our big gig? What's the entire school board doing here? - Uh, everything's taken care of. You guys just make sure you get into your costumes on time. Okay? I've got everything under control, Joan. Believe me. - Something the matter, sir? - You mean to say, this fish is fresh? What kind of way is that to serve fish? Fresh? You gotta freeze it first. Hey, smell this. Like a fish, it smells. Who the hell wants to eat fish that smells like a fish? This fish is so fresh, it's swimmin' on my fingers. (woman screaming) - Hey, this is groovy. - Mmm. - I should get out more often. - Yeah. - You two girls are really foxy. You must be in a rock band, huh? What's your name? - Yeah, yeah. It was the uh-- - With The Rayon. - The Polyesters. - Huh? - Uh, uh-- - We're with The Silks. - Yeah, The Silks, yeah. - It's very-- - Smooth, yeah. - Smooth. I like that. - Hey, Midge. You wanna go see the last game of the Series? I got tickets. - Me? - Yeah. - I-I love baseball. - Yeah? - I love all sports. - Yeah? - Yeah! - Okay! Hey, you know, you already got one hell of a layup. I-I think if we work on your jump shot, you could be a pro. Really, really. - Serious? - Seriously. - Just stay here. I don't want to lose you. Let me just pull you around here. You know, and you seem like such nice people too. It's not just looks, you know what I mean? Let's go, huh? Hey. Let's go. - It's Hunta. What the hell is she doing here? Looks like our big gig is gonna turn into a blitzkrieg. - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Palace. (club patrons cheering and applauding) - Hey, Chuck! - Hi. (Tweeter laughing) - That's a friend of mine. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, great guy. Got him his first gig. - Tonight, we are especially proud to have with us the board members from the educational capital of the Western world, Hooter College here. (scattered applause) - Yay, Hooter! - And now it is my pleasure to introduce that oh so respected educator, that Dean about town, Dean Hunta. (scattered applause) - Yay! (thunderclap booming) - Thank you. (clearing throat) Ladies and gentlemen of the Hooter School Board, honored guests, we are gathered here this evening in hope that we can reach our goal of making enough money for the Hooter College football team to purchase badly needed athletic equipment. - This is gettin' boring. - Coach Langley advises me that uh, with a strong exercise program, we can turn the team around. - Vinnie, now. - Excuse me ladies, because uh, I gotta take a leak. - Support...

Vinnie, I'm gonna be raking in... Like, next to nothing, you know what I mean? Like, very, very, very, very little money. Like... Bare minimum, you know? Sometimes life has a funny way of making everything right again, you know? I mean, look at me and The Splitz. Just when you think the ride is over, wham, you're off on another wild spin. And just when you think you've got everything you wanted, boom, everything you ever wanted changes. You just can't predict what will happen. And I guess that's a pretty good reason to just stick it out, give it all you got, and you go for the gusto or don't go at all, or something, I don't know. But just a word of advice; When it comes to those gates of knowledge, walk proud, but not alone. Take a glance over your shoulder to make sure your dreams are still there, because they ought to be, walking right in there with you.
