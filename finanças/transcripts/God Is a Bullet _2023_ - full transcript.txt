- Bob, what are you doing? It's 10 o'clock. - Just finishing up some stuff here. - Get outta here. Go home. - Yeah, I will. Couple more minutes. - Bob, I'm not asking. I'm telling, okay? Go drink some eggnog or something. It's Christmas, for Christ sakes - Merry Christmas. - Fuck you. - You don't care! Calm? Stop telling me to calm down! - They'll call the cops. - Good, let them call the cops. I'll talk to the cops. They're gonna arrest your ass. - Yeah, you want that now? You know what's going on with the cops? You don't know what the fuck happened? - What? I want a fucking divorce. I'm not fucking happy with you. Oh, don't say shit I can't come back with, I hate you, motherfucker. I hate you. You don't even give a fuck. - Just another husband, huh? - Yeah, just another husband. Just another lying sack-of-shit husband like you. - Hey. - Ho, ho, ho. Look out the window. - Hi. - Hey, kid. How's it going? - Yeah, I'm okay. - What is it? - Nothing. It's just that I saw this family today at the market, a mother and father. And this kid was riding some dumb airplane ride. And then when it was over, the mother asked the boy, "What do you wanna do now?" Just, like in that moment, they could do whatever they wanted, you know? As a family. - Yeah. - I told you it was stupid. - Nah, it's not stupid. How's your mother? - Uh, she's okay. - Well, wish her a Merry Christmas for me, okay? - Yeah, I will. Goodnight. - Goodnight, sweetheart. - Mom? Hello? - No! - Cyrus, look what I found. Look at her. Look here! - No! - Look at that. - Get off me! No! Get off me! No. No! - One for you. One for you. Here's one for you. - Arthur? Arthur. Santa! Have you seen Gabi? Have you seen Gabi? She's supposed to meet me here. Her phone's been busy all mornin - You call the house? - Yeah, house line, cell, nothing. Will you drive out there with me You know how she gets, just me showing up. - Yeah. Fucking divorces. - Ho, ho, ho. Sara! Gabi! Grandpops. You don't think they could have been overcome by fumes or something? - Arthur. Wait out here. Hello? Sara? Gabi? - The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For thou art with me. - What's going on? - Thinking. - What you reading? Oh yeah, I read about that. But what are you doing sitting all alone in the dark? Huh? - I breathe better in the dark. I don't know why. I just do. - A girl so young. - Yeah. Young. - Jesus. You think she's still alive? - She could be. But if she is, what she's going through ain't like nothing those sheep in Clay could even imagine. - You want to go downstairs? We got some of those Circus Cookies with the sprinkles. We could just eat a million of them. - I'm thinking about writing the Sheriff's Department in a minute. - Case Hardin? Bob Hightower. - You wanna? - She's a professional liar, Bob She was in a cult, for Christ's sake. Assault with a knife, prostitution. conspiracy to sell heroin. You really think this person is trustworthy? - She says, she's got information. - Fine. Bring her in. Sit her junkie ass across from me. I'll pay the fucking Uber. - Come on, John. People like that aren't comfortable coming in here. - No shit, she's not comfortable - Please, it's been six weeks. - Bob. - Six weeks. We haven't gotten anywhere. - Bob! We're doing everything we can. I've let you take all the files and we run every lead, no matter Haven't I? It's the right thing to do, and I wouldn't have it any other way if I was in your shoes. - Wait, this is a lead. - But this type of bitch knows all the angles. And you're way out of your league. Look, it'd be another thing if you were an experienced investigator but. - But what? Go on, say it. - You're a desk cowboy, Bob. A seat warmer. I'm sorry. You want the truth, there it is. - Yes, sir. - You want coffee? - Yes, thanks. Black. - I would offer you a beer, but I'll be on the wagon for the next 40 or 50 years. - I believe this was a cult murder. Not a robbery or any of the crap you read in the paper. I have photos from that night. You could take a look at them and tell me what you think. - Okay. Was Gabi into drugs? - No. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. I know my daughter. - Her friends into satanic shit of any kind? - Satanic? She's 14 years old. She look like she hangs with that kind of crowd? Look, we live in a small Christian community. We don't have much in the way of deviant behavior. - We all came from family-oriented communities. Even me. Was this man a drug addict? This is a syringe mark. - Is it? What about this? - You're crossing over. - Judgement. The 20th enigma of the Tarot. - The angel signaling... - Judgement. What do you know about it? - Was he injected with a paralytic? - What do you know? Case? - No, no. - I need to think. - You gotta tell me what you know. - No, I can't. - Case? - No. - Case? Case, wait. - No, please. I just need you to go away. - You have to tell me what you know. - You have to tell me. - What's going on? - I lost my wife. I lost my daughter. Tell me what you know! - That's enough, Mr. Hightower. - I'm leaving. - What'd you say? I didn't hear you. You're what? - I said, I'm leaving. - Oh yeah. That's what I, uh, that's what I thought you said. - No! Cyrus, Cyrus, she doesn't-- fucking talk about, - Stay out of it. Anyone else wanna leave? Huh? What about you, bitch? You want to try me again? I got another boot here. - Damn! Let's go for a walk. - Cyrus, please! - You want to go? Then go. But be careful. There ain't no turning back. Fuck you! Keep it running. Hey, it's me. You're not gonna shoot me, are you? - I wasn't expecting anyone. What do you want? - I think I know who took your daughter. and I'm betting she's alive. - Yeah? - Yeah. The paralytic, the card. I know this crew's handiwork. - How? - Personal experience. I used to be one. - And you think Gabi's alive? - I do. - All right. Well, I'm gonna need a sworn statement. and that means names, descriptions of everyone involved. - Slow down, Bob. If you think you're going to track them down with the cops or even the FBI, you can forget about it. - Forget about it? - Yeah. These are the followers of the Left Handed Path. The word of the Devil. What? You think you can just write down an address and go round 'em up? You won't even get close. And as soon as they see a bunch of dumb shit cops sniffing around the first thing Cyrus'll do is slit your daughter's throat. and drink her blood. - Don't fucking say that. - I know that it's hard. I know that. But you gotta hear me on this, okay? Forget about the authorities tracking your daughter down. It ain't gonna happen. If you want her back, you gotta get her yourself. And lose the Boy Scout uniform. - All right, yeah. What else? - Get as much cash as you can and a truck that runs. - Yeah, I got one. - Okay, good, 'cause you and me are going on the road. - We are? - Yeah, you and me, Bob. I'll be back bright and early. - I don't understand. Where do you fit in? - You think that you can do this alone? No offense, but you don't send out sheep to hunt wolves. - We should reconsider. This is reckless, son. And dangerous. - Just leave it alone, Arthur. I've made my decision. I'll live with the consequences. - She's such a tramped out excuse of a thing. I wouldn't put my faith in that. - I put my faith in God. Her, I'm traveling with. - How do you know she won't sell you out? - I don't. - How do you know she won't rob ya? - I'm dying inside, Arthur. Do you understand? A little bit every day, but I'm dying. I might be stupid, but I'm going. - Give me the keys, I'll drive. - I want you to know something, miss. If anything happens to this man over there, there is nothing you can say or do to save your ass from me. We understand each other? - Absolutely. And you know what? I'm blown away. As a matter of fact, I'm a little wet between my legs. - Be careful. - What? - Nothing. Just thinking, maybe if you'd had a stronger moral compass as a child, like a religious foundation, that you'd possibly be better equipped to deal with what happened to you. - You fucking kidding? - Well, think about it. - I got snatched, asshole, just like your little girl. Right out from underneath my mother's nose when I was 11. Ain't got nothing to do with religion. - I'm sorry. Like I said, I don't mean to judge. - Yeah, well, too late. - Half an hour. I mean it. I want her back in pretty much the same shape I left her in. - Yeah. Yeah. You hear me? Don't fucking worry about it. Oh, sweet Jesus. Come here, baby girl. - What's your name? - Case. Case. Oh, you're perfect. Just perfect Whoo! Bubba, what you think? - Yeah, baby. Reminds me of our own little girl. This is gonna be fun. - Hi, come here. Hi. Hi. Oh, gotcha. Yeah, they remember you. - Ferryman. - You, you gonna give them all the love? Come on, now. Come on, now. Come on, now. Look at you. Glad to see you're amongst the living. - That's me, little miss sunshine. - So, who's that over there? - Oh, that's Bob. His last name's whatever you put on his new ID. - Okay, Mr. Bob Whatever. - You got that fucking armor for me, or what? - I got the whole store over there for you. Hey, how you doing, Robert? Hey. Should we start this ID? - No. Decal work first. I want shit with bite. - With that pasty white skin, this ink gonna look real nice. - I thought we were here for gun You didn't say anything about tattoos. - Yeah, well. - Yeah, well, what? - Bob, imagine if I showed up at your little church looking like this. You think I'd get a couple stares? Well, you're about to show up to a whole different type of church, my church. And believe me, it's just as bigoted as yours. - Why didn't you tell me before? - I don't like discussing things more than once. - I don't like surprises. - Then don't be surprised by anything. - Well, sorry. I'm not comfortable with it. - Okay then. You can just pull the plug right now, go our separate ways. Last time I checked, I was doing you a favor. - Hey Bee-Dub, you up. Mm-hmm, good one now. What you want? You want cursive? Hieroglyphics? - Just don't go crazy. - All right. - You want to get this. So, what do you think, Bob Whater? - It's good. - Good? That's some genuine, stone cold, Left Handed, black magic shit right there. It's perfect. See, you gotta understand, great tattoo art doesn't come from bullshit stencils like you see in those dick shop windows. It has to be drawn to fit the skin. So the skin becomes the flesh and the flesh becomes it. It's like a marriage. - Stoned motherfucker boring you to death? - He's working on it. - Gotta use the head. Mind if I inside? - You know where it is. What am I working on? - Ying, yang, yang. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yang's all out. - I robbed your refrigerator. - Toss 'em again. - You're not making poor motherfucker throw the coins, are you? - Yes, you gotta get it right. Come on. - You and your fortune telling bullshit. - It's not my bullshit. He's the one who throws the coins. He decides his own destiny. I'm just here to report the facts. - Mumbo jumbo fucking cha cha. - It's not mumbo jumbo. It's synchronicity. I don't ask the questions. I don't answer 'em. Time will tell us all of that. The coins don't lie. - Let's just get this over with. - No. Fuck that. Give me the fucking thing. - What are you doing? - One final touch. - No. - Come on. - Hey, no. Not my face. - Please. - No fucking way. - What's the matter, Bee-Dub? You don't want to mess up them school boy good looks? - Come on, daddy. All my lovers have one. - Fuck. - It's time for the money. - 3,000. - It's five. - No. Two shotguns, four handguns, ammo, ID. 3,000, there's the deal. - He knows. It's okay, I'll fucking deal with it. Just give me the money. - What if he doesn't deal? - Then I'll take his arm, start killing the dogs one at a time, just give me the fucking money. Wait here, okay? - Let's put this chit-chat in perspective. What's with the sheep? - Let's see if this math adds up. One plus one equals Cyrus. - Oh fuck. - 12-24-20, right there in your handiwork. - Look, I swear to God, I don't give a shit. But what you doing? You was on your way to clearing your own shit up. Why this? You got a death wish? Huh? Is that what you got? 'Cause they'll give it to you. You out. Leave it alone. Screw the sheep. Cyrus too. He's a sheep. Different breed, but he's a motherfucking sheep. Leave it. I thought you gave that whole bad boy shit up when you split, but now this? Let me tell you something, Case. They will leave your ass behind. - Where is he? - They're on rat patrol. - And the girl? She with him? - She with him. Who's the sheep? - Interested third party. - How interested? - Blood and bones, baby doll. It's all crossing overtime now. - Bob, I'm glad you could join us. We were just discussing philosophies. See, my take on things is, is that selfishness is the key to survival. What you think, Bob Whatever? - I think you don't give a shit what I think. We all done? Well? - She was alive two weeks ago. - Hello, darling. New videos? - Fuck you. - "How was your day, Maureen?" Fine, just tired. I had drinks with Emerald, she thinks Alan might be having an affair. Also saw to Arthur. Said Bob's taken off. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Packed a bag and hit the road. Seems he's on to something. - I doubt it. Bob's a fucking idiot. Oh, really? As defined by whom? You? Is it true you offered him a job managing the development? - He needed a change. Arthur felt the same. - Don't consult me or anything. - Consult you? - Yeah. The man works for me, Mo. Just de-ball me at every turn. - Oh, God. Pass me the ice and gin shaker thingy. Because I need a few close frien inside me. - Be your own fucking bartender. - You know, John. When I first met you, I knew you were weak, but found you modestly charming. But like polish on cheap shoes, that charm scuffed off and left you as you really are. Limp. - Have another drink. - I didn't mind it so much when I was younger. There was something docile and sweet about it. For a while, I actually thought you were sensitive. And that weakness kind of brought out the mother in me, and at night, it gave me the opportunity to be on top, put the strap-on to you. You remember how you used to love that, baby? - Wow. You're really putting it out there tonight. - I'm looking to bat three for four, baby. - You know, I'd watch my mouth if I were you, I'm in no mood tonight. - What are you going to do, fuck me? You'd have to get your little dick hard first. - Say what you want, Mo, but you're not going to humiliate me like you did with Sammy boy. - What does that mean? - It means I'd better be careful if I were you. You might get your own personal Jack the Ripper slitting that saggy neck of your - Fuck you. - Fuck you! Fuck you! Why don't you go back in your little study and jerk off, you fucking pervert?! - At least I don't bring my humps home in brown paper bags. Watch little boys suck on their little dicks. Come on, sweetheart. Nothing to say now, huh? - Oh, my God! You're such a pussy! - Tell me about Cyrus. I want to get a read on him. Well, what's his story? - His story? - Yeah. What? You got someplace else to be? I mean, we're stuck in this fucking car for hours. - Really fucked up as a kid, bad junkie, thief, prostitute, sold his ass to pay for his bad habit, that sort of shit. But then... - But what? - Somewhere along the line, something changed. I don't know the reason. But whatever it was, he found the Left Handed Path, and that was it. It anchored him, like those freaks that find Jesus. - Excuse me. My ex-wife was butchered by this piece of shit. So if you wouldn't mind not comparing his satanical bullshit to someone believing in Jesus Christ. - Hey, you asked. Pick your fucking poison. - No. Religion isn't secular. It's pure. It's the unmoved truth that all principles spin out from. - Ooh, you're a real clit dryer, Bob. You know that? - That motherfucker cooked your head pretty good, didn't he? - I wouldn't use the word pretty and I wouldn't use the word good - Not give a fuck about you. Cleaned up his act, kept all his troops junkies. - No, the truth's much worse. - Yeah? - Once upon a time, I was a disease just waiting to I found a ringmaster with a magic needle. And I bowed before that needle. When I got low enough, I made a God out of it. The Devil's only an idea, Bob, an excuse for evil, just as your God is an excuse for good. They're concepts. They're the needles just waiting for people like you and me to stick 'em in. - That's real deep. I mean, wow. You know what? I'll tell you what. I'll keep my faith. You can keep the rest of whatever the fuck it is you're talking about. Gracias. - What made you finally decide to leave? Cyrus, the group? I mean, what made you take off? - Mama? - Stop! What? Why are you following me? - Hey! Hey! You mind your fucking business, you fat fucking cunt! I'll slit your fucking throat. - A woman in a store. So stupid. Didn't even look like her. I don't even know what I would've done if it was actually her or what I woulda said. Hey, mom. How's it going? How have the last dozen fucking years been? Maybe I would have asked what I was like when I was younger because I don't fucking remember or you know, when she stopped looking, like, what the fuck happened? - You ever find out what happened to her? Does she even know you're alive? - No. I don't know. I don't even know if I want her to. - Well, why not? - Because I don't. All right? It's been a dozen fucking years. And what's with all the question - Okay, okay. Mind your own fucking business. - Can we get the check, please? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. The prodigal daughter returns. And who's this? A new member of the family? - This is Bob. Bob, this is Errol. - What are you doing here, headcase? - Well, we were having dinner in Nogales, and I remembered your bar. So I thought, why not come by and say hello? - Oh, dear, dear, dear. I'm glad to see you couldn't make it. - I'm leaving. - Right? - Hey! Hey! Bob! Bob, stop. - Fucking piece of work, you know that? - Bet your ass. - Clean and sober, huh? When'd you start using? - When did I start keeping my sleeves down, huh? - I don't give a shit. - You don't fucking know. Do you? - Leave me alone. Just shut up. Shut up. - 100 fucking degrees in that shit locker restaurant, I've got my sleeves tucked in my fucking hands. Fucking stooge. You want to fucking know what's going on, huh? Fucking listen and learn, desk boy. - Don't fucking... - Powder? Vitamin C. Liquid cleaner. Looks bad, scabs up nice. No one but a fucking moron would believe that I'm a shooter without checking me out first, especially with an albatross like you hanging around my neck. Happy? - You don't trust me? We're supposed to be a fucking team. - Not a team. I'm the one who's finding your daughter. You don't need to know shit. Better off staying stupid. - Perfect. Listen. - Forget it, Bob. You're strictly the missionary position. - You lie to me to get me to react a certain way. The missionary position and not a trick more. Is that a slogan or just pure venom? 'Cause the last time I looked, - Last time you looked would just be that, the last time you fucking looked - I'm looking at you! The banality of your cheap whore tricks, the lies. Fuck you! No, you don't fucking fool me. You think you fool me? I know why you're here. I'm gonna help him get her back, otherwise, if we would get too close, Cyrus'll kill her quick. What? You think your therapist wouldn't tell me? - I did say that. I just thought, if she had to go through what I did. - Don't. Just save it. I can imagine it all. - Errol said Cyrus is coming. - When? - A few days, a week, he doesn't know, but he's coming And Errol's gonna arrange a little homecoming for me. - Jesus Christ, what happened? I'm so sorry, Mo. - Don't be. Look, I have to tell you something. - Oh, yeah! I had an affair with Sam. John Lee knew about it. I don't know how. But he threatened to kill me if it ever happened again. - You slept with my baby's husband? How could you? - I didn't sleep with him because he was her husband. Look, he was young, he was willing. He was everything John Lee hated, okay? It was stupid. Arthur. Listen to me. I don't think John Lee wants to find out who killed Sara and Sam. - I'm going. Can't stand this room any longer. Where's Errol? No se. Maybe still at Maquila. - Tequila, please. - Nice fucking artwork, man. I mean it. Fucking deluxe shit you got there. - Thanks. - What the fuck, man? Gutter's waiting. Time to move. Hey! - Hey! - Granny... - Mm? that doorstop in the lobby. With the decal work. What was up with that? - Which one? - What do you mean? - That piece on his face. It didn't look a little weird to you? - Weird how? - It's the same mark as Lena. Come on. Get your fucking head out of paper bags, prince. That's Lena's girlfriend's mark. Now it's on some doorstop's face in the middle of Shitville six months later, that's pretty fucking Gothic. - Not gothic. She's here. I just ran into her by accident. - Who? - Headcase. You just blew off her old man. You saw fucking Case? You saw fucking Case? You're telling me that freakshow back there is Case's old man? - Yes. Case says he's been her Platinum but now she's looking for a re-union. - With Cyrus? No. She is not one of us. There is nothing coincidental about anything she does. That Yoko bitch would eat her own young. - That's pretty gothic, huh? Cinderella returning, knocking on the door. - What'd you tell him, Errol? - Nothing. She was junked out. She's just looking for a little bit of dope, that's all. - What are you doing talking to strangers, anyway? - It was a coincidence. - A coincidence? - You know what? Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. I don't answer to you. I don't answer to fucking Cyrus. And I'm not gonna stand here in this motherfucking river While you two idiots try to come with a coherent fucking thought! It's fucking Case! She wants to come back home. And I personally don't give two fucks if Cyrus sees her or not. I just figured he'd want to bleed the bitch. - He's close, isn't he? - Fucking black magic. If they cross, we're fucked. - We're fucked, but we're crossing. - What about the guns? - Don't worry about it. Go. - Hello, sheep. - Headcase wanted me to tell you she's doing a little night-skyin - Where is she? - Over the hills and through the woods... Really shouldn't be following us, man. It don't look too hot on your resume. - If she's blowing me off, I want to hear it from her. - Sorry, no pre-recorded messages. Judgement. - If something happens to her, I swear to God. You hear me?! - Go back, Bob. - Case? - Go back, it's over. - Where are you? - Go fucking back! - Well, well. Hello. - I want to come home. - What? You said you wanted a little blood. - Okay. It's okay. - We all wanna come home in the end, don't we? But how much is it worth to you? - It's worth everything. - Good answer. Okay, load her up. That's my girl. You know what the real equalizers in life are? Suffering and death. Everything else is daycare. But suffering and death? They lay it out pretty fast when it comes to who you really are. How do I know I can trust you coming home? How do I know you're not trying to fuck me? Maybe you don't love me anymore. You bring a pistol? Maybe you wanna punch a few holes in the messenger. - No. - I don't know. People play all sorts of games. Know what I mean, Errol? - What? - You like games. Don't ya, chief? - Uh. Yeah, I don't know. I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about. - Sure you do, Mr. Firewater, Mr. Fucking Yuppie Redskin Phony who changed his name so nobody would know he was a piece of shit from the reservation. I mean, I'm Cherokee, but what the fuck? - How do I know you and the dead one aren't in this together? - Come on. - How do I know?! - I'm not buying into this shit. God damn it. You don't even fucking believe what you're saying. Huh? And I don't travel with protection. I don't need a fucking weapon. I don't scam anybody. I don't screw anybody. And if I did, would I use fucking headcase? Fucking, oh no! Jesus Christ! This isn't fucking funny, man. Oh fuck. - It's time you wore your death - The fuck are you doing? Shit! The fuck! Jesus Christ! - Put on some music. - Music? Cyrus, I'm your fucking partner! You don't get it. - Louder! Yeah. - Cyrus, I'm your fucking boy. What the fuck the is this? - Yeah, that's it. We need blood to preserve the youth of America. Go to it, sister. - This is not funny! This is not a fucking joke! - No, no, no, no, no! Oh my God! Fuck! - Shoot him! Shoot him! - What the fuck?! Fuck! No! No! - Mujer blanco? Have you seen mujer blanco? No? Hey. Mujer blanco? Hey! Mujer blanco. Mujer blanco? - No? You're wearing her fucking jacket. Where is she? Where? Away we go. Where? - Get off her. Sit the fuck down! What do you want? Case? Case, can you stand up? We need to get outta here. Put your arms around me. - No, I don't. Come on, man. - Okay. - You gotta pull over. I gotta visit some old witches. Yeah, fuck me is right. - You all right? - I had him. I fucking had him. I shoulda killed him when I had the chance. - Don't worry about it. Wouldn't get us where we need to go. Come on. We're not gonna find him here, are we? - No. But he's going to the Mojave next. - Last night, when I was looking for you, no one spoke English. I couldn't understand anyone. For some reason, Sam came to my mind. - Who? - My ex-wife's husband. I always thought she married him in part because he was Black. Point out the differences between us. Thinking about that says an awful lot about who I am. I'm not sure it's the man I set out to be. I thought I had it all figured out. I really did. That the universe was bound together by all the beautiful things I believed in. - Come. Lie down. - But I was wrong. - Come on. You need to rest your brain. Don't beat yourself up. You're doing what you need to do. The thing is, we're all fucked up and wrong, trying to hide all the shit that's broken. If I were to be truly straight with you, when I first came out, you know, it wasn't just about revenge, helping you. But you were right. Cyrus didn't give a shit about me. I was nothing to him. - No going home, I guess. - I'm sorry you had to kill someone. I'm sorry it was over me. - It's funny the things we, we tell ourselves without saying anything. the agreements we make. - Yeah. - I'm sorry you had to suffer. - It's all right. My body they had. The rest they'll never find. - Whoo! Yeah! Yes! Yes, baby! Darling motherfucking! Oh, fuck! Jesus Christ! I don't want any fucking psychodrama from you right now. - We need to talk. Outside now. - Easy! Easy! Easy! What the fuck? What the fuck, man? What the fuck do you want, man? - Where's Cyrus? - I don't know. - Yeah, you do. - I don't fucking know, man. I have no fucking idea. You don't think I know what's wheelin', you fool fuckin' prick? You think because you have some business, that you're going to stay alive and well? Forget it. The moment he started on you in that room, he already had the vision. He's putting the black evocation on your ass right now. Yeah. I think you're just trying to fill me up with your of junkie devil shit 'cause your ass wants to revenge cuz you got fucked. - Now, you're gonna show the lady some respect. We have business here. All right, man. However you want to fucking sell it. - Where is he? I don't know. I don't know. He says he's gonna contact me. - This is all talk sickness. - I swear to God. He fucking said he's gonna reach out. - You're fucking with the black riders, yuppie boy. We ain't giving you another pass. How many times do I have to fucking say it, you stupid bitch. I don't fucking know! - Fucking kill you! Come out of your dreams! I'll play witch and disciple across your throat while you sle across your throat while you sleep! - Are you out of your fucking mind? He's in the ranger station. Where else would he be, you fucking bitch! - Bitch! - Oh, my God! - Oh, right, I'm a bitch? Huh? What'd you say, that I'm a fucking bitch? Come on! You wanna fucking lie to me?! Fucking scum bag! - You know what? Fuck you! - You should have let me fucking kill him. He's gonna screw us, you know that? He's gonna fucking screw us! - Let it go for now. - You should have let me cross him. Hey! - You all right? - Yeah. - You know something, don't you? Is my daughter dead? Did they kill her? I don't know. They could have. - It's a death rite. - What? - They bring children here. Drug them, rape them. In the end, they're killed. - Goddamnit! God fucking damnit! - Not all, but mostly all. They keep some like me. - No! We gotta get out of here, okay? - No, hold on. Hold on. What about that dope? That shit Cyrus had to deliver to Errol. Could it be here? Is it possible - We can't look for it. We don't have time. - Don't matter. Let's send Cyrus a message. - Headcase. - Oh, yeah? How do you know? - I saw her less than 24 hours ago. She wanted me to send you a message. - That fucking cunt's got nine lives. - Go on. - Says they took all the product you moved across the border. - They did, huh? - Yeah. - She said that? - Yeah. Her and the doorstop. Says that she took it out of the house. But um, did they? Did they get that? Did you put it in the house? You couldn't have put it in the house. Be a mad move. And you don't make bad moves. I mean, you could do bad things, but... Right? 'Cause that's, you know, a lot of fucking-- It's a lot of fucking-- fucking product. - How did she know about this place, Errol? - I don't know. But get this. She wants to meet you. - To meet me? - Yes. Says she wants to trade the product that she stole for some girl. Says you'd know about it. - Who's got the magic? - Oh, you found it. - Hail Satan. - Hail Satan, motherfucker. - It's on now. - Is that the crank? Yeah! Yeah! Show time. - I've been thinking. Might have to accept the fact that Gabi's already dead. - Either way, we gotta find out. Can't give up. - No, she, my little girl. You know? I used to believe that my faith protected me, that every action of the soul was meaningful. I really did. That we're more than just flesh, bone, molecules. That God was good and everything would work out. What am I talking about? You don't believe in any of that, do you? - No, Coyote, I don't. I think we all know what life is really about. We're not just ready to accept the bad news. So we fight it with God and the Devil and all this New Age bullshit. Everyone needs a club, right? Club God or Club Scream. Take your pick. But when it comes down to it, we all know that it's X amount of years and then the ground. Take a look. This is the ultimate life form, the great equalizer. It has no ties, plays no favorites. All life falls before it. It's as simple and profound as any parable the Bible could slop up. This is God, Coyote, grin and bear it. - Gonna get a cigarette. - Bob! - You're gonna tell us. Where's my daughter? Where's my daughter? - Bob? Bob. Bob. Fuck. Granny, you gotta tell us. Is the girl still alive? - Come and get me, cunt. - You're crossing over. - What happened? Okay, Bob Whatever. I'm gonna play a little medic, okay? Going to do a little memory time on the late night river. All that catch-dogging got those nerve endings burnt up pretty bad. Heart is all over the place. You going to go into shock soon. Or you could die from the horse protein I'm gonna give you. Can you hear me? - Thirsty. - What? - I'm real thirsty. - Okay. You should have let me finish throwing them coins. You might be dead already and we just wasting time. I'm gonna give you a little fun juice. So, whatever trip you make I'm gonna make it a little more enjoyable for you now. - You think he's gonna make it? - Maybe. But if I was a betting man, I'd say we looking at a dead man. - How you feeling? I love you. I love you, Gabi. You're gonna be okay, sweetheart. You're gonna be okay. Is it better? Do you feel it? Yeah, that's good. Now, it's gonna be okay. - It's okay. It's okay. Breathe. You gotta breathe. Please. - You take her. Promise me, right? - Okay. - If she's alive, you, you... - Sure. Sure, I can. - You're the only one I trust. So you take her. You promise me. Promise me! - Yes, I promise. - Mm? - Alive, huh? - Yeah, looks like it. - Are you thirsty? - Yeah. - I'm glad you made it, Coyote. - What's going on? - Cyrus called. We let you sleep. - What's this? - It's bon voyage, Bee-Dub. Means get the fuck out. - You ready? - I'm ready. - Not even a kiss hello? I'm sorry about Mexico. - It's all right. - I tried to stop him, Case. - Just forget about it. - Okay. - Is that the boy toy? Got the shit with you? - It's in the back. - So where we going? - Take 14 South. - To where? - You know, you and I don't have to not get along, you know? - We ain't gonna be around each other long enough for one way or the other, sheep. Just take fucking 14 South. - Yeah. Yeah. - What the-- what the fuck, dude! - Cyrus called. He said you hired him to go into the house. - And you're going to believe that psychopath? - Why would he lie? - To get back at us for Furnace Creek, Arthur. He's trying to fuck with our heads. - Stop it! Stop! - He said you hired him to kill Sam because Sam was fucking Maureen. How would he know that?! If he was a liar, how would he know? - Who is this Cyrus? Who the fuck is Cyrus? - Go ahead, breast beater. Tell her our little secret. - Just sign it, Nona. It's a lot of money. - Yes, this is a very, very generous offer. Once in a lifetime, Nona. Can I call you, Nona? Cuz I feel like I've known-ya. - Maybe. Well, luxury homes? - That's right. Luxury homes, at a reasonable price. - Churches. - Christian. Christian. - Christian. I like that. You know I'm a Catholic. - The best of us are, Nona. The best of us are. - Especially when it comes to my good Catholic friend right here who's gonna be his partner, I know. - Oh, oh, oh! Whoo, whoo, whoo! - I'm not selling. - Cyrus, I thought you said this was a done deal. - It is a done deal. Look at it one more time, Nona. It's stupid land. You don't even care about it! - Cyrus, when Nona says no, it's no. Guys, you know, I love my birds. I'm gonna keep my land. - I'm gonna step outside, guys. - I'm gonna go too. - Hey, John Lee, watch this. - You stupid fucking junkie. - What happened? - I think this crazy fuck just solved our problems. - Holy shit, John Lee. What are we gonna do? - Don't worry. You just take the brochures and - Yeah, yeah. He's right, Arthur. Arthur. Arthur, come on. I got this. No, no, I got it, I got it. You go home. You know, I'll take care of everything. This is a good thing. Okay? All right. You have the signature? - Yeah, it's right there. - Oh, it's perfect. Okay, I got this. You clean everything else up. - Yeah, I got it. - I'll be in touch. - Ha ha! Ha ha! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Arthur, is that true? - Yeah, it's true. - Honey, don't take it so badly. Just trying to put a little away for our golden jubilees. Arthur, listen to me. Cyrus is smart. He knows Bob's out there looking for him. - John Lee... - So you need to get to him and get him off the road. - And not just for his sake. - Sweetheart. - Just a second. Listen... You don't want Cyrus caught, okay? We'd make a pretty picture in the papers, wouldn't we? - Honey... - What is it, you cunt parrot? - Hey, give me my phone. Case, give me my phone. - Sit the fuck down. - Are you kidding me? - I said sit the fuck down! - Give me my fucking phone! - It's me. - Ah. - Shut the fuck up. - Hello, debased one. Have you come home to be swallow - Yes. - I see. - Well then, go see Errol. Get my money. He'll be waiting. Bring the dope you stole from me - Come on, Cyrus. We both know there's no dope. We know that you're onto us. Lena told us everything. - No, I fucking didn't! They're fucking lying! Cyrus, I didn't say fucking anything! I didn't say fucking anything! Help! Fuck you! - I don't care. Get my money from Errol. - What money? - I told Errol the product would be delivered tonight and to have my money ready. $100,000. - But we don't have your stuff. We don't have anything. - Then I'd say you've got a big fucking problem. Sundown, Energy road. See you there. - But, how? What do we trade with? - I don't know. Your lives, I guess. - He wants us to kill Errol. - What? - Take the money. Errol's waiting to make a trade. We bring Cyrus the money, he gives us the girl. - You fucking killed me, Casey. You fucking killed me. I can never go back now. Is that why you didn't let this fucking sheep do it to me? You fucking could. No, fuck you! I'm fucking dead! I have no fucking where to go. - That's not our problem. - Fuck you, sheep! Fuck you! - Hey, you could help us. - Fuck you too, then! I ain't doing it! - You're out on the street with a bulleye on your back! - Who the fuck are you, Case? - That's it. Enough. Get out. - You fucking get the fuck out. No! Casey, you fucking tell him. You know I didn't! - No! No! No, Casey! You fucking tell him! No! Casey! No! - What the fuck. - Fucking leave it. - Fuck you! You fucking traitor! You fucking sheep! You're the fucking sheep! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you looking at, pervert? - Hey. - Hey. Girl, what are you doing? You were all the way out and then come back with this big old neon sign around your neck. Shooting the place up, guns blazing. Why? May as well have slit your own throat. - I know. - You think we didn't know about your little rehab? - We gave you the pass. - I know. You don't think I know? I fucking know. I need you to tell him something for me, Wood. Tell him he can have me. I'll bring the money, I'll bring everything. He can do whatever the fuck he wants with me, have a field day with my dead body. Just let the girl go. That's the deal. Me for her. You tell him. - What do you want me to say, Casey? We both know how this is gonna end. - I gotta have this one, Wood. He doesn't want the girl. He wants me. You tell him that. - Alright. I'll tell him. - Let's do this. - Time to get swallowed. - Stop right there. Put the bags down. Now show me your hands and back the fuck up. - All right, I'll take my bag back. - Oh, yeah? - You haven't paid for it yet, Slick. - How about I pay for it right now? - No. No. No! Fuck no! No! Get the fuck out. Hey! Easy. Easy. Easy. Come on! What are you doing, huh? This is my fucking house. What do you want? Fuck you! I'm so fucking over it! You want the money? Is that what you want? You got the fucking money. Actually, take it. - Bob. - It's not my fucking money. - Shut the fuck up. - Bob. - What? - What? Fucking take it! Fucking take it! - You're crossing over. - So, what are we doing? We get Headcase, and you get the girl, correct? That's the arrangement? - No. No. No. Get the fuck away from here. - You stick that gun up my face, I'll stick it up your fucking ass, bitch! - I'm gonna cut you like a bitch, motherfucker! - It's all right. - What do you mean it's alright? It's not fucking alright. - I made a deal, okay? - You what? - I'll eat your fucking face! - I made a fucking deal, okay? - You're dying tonight, bitch! You're fucking dying! - I'm confused. This is what she proposed, correct? But, now it's no good? - No good. I'm not trading her. I'm not trading her for anything. - Oh, come on, Bob. - Shut up. Shut the fuck up! - So, what exactly is it that you're offering, Bob? - Where's the rest of it? - Where's my fucking daughter? You'll get the rest when we've got Gabi and we're safe and sound. - Pay me later? I don't think so, Bob. It's not like I'm giving you half your daughter back. Your legacy's waiting for you over that hill. When you see her, just drop the money and take her. But all of it, Bob. Every penny. And you and I are finished. - Okay. - One other thing. When you get home, Ask Arthur and John Lee who killed the old witch. Ask who hired me to go carve up your pretty little wife. You ask. - Let's go. - Now you, headcase. I want a word with you. I just want you to know that whatever happens tonight, you're crossing over. Oh, yeah. The word's out, honey. We're coming out of the gutter for you. And when we find you, just know that I'm going to be right there to watch you beg. - Unbelievable. - What? - You should have taken the fucking deal. - You go behind my back. It's great. - I had it all worked out, you fucking idiot! It was done, you had your daughter backi! - We don't trade people for-- - They're gonna come for us, you know that, right? They're not letting us go. They're gonna ride us out into the fucking black hole, - then they'll come. - I know! If you know, then what's your fucking plan?! I don't have a plan, alright?! Let's just go get Gabi and we'll figure it out. - Throw the fucking money over. - Gabi! - How you getting home, huh? How you getting out? - Thank God. - Bob. Bob, we gotta go. They're coming for us, okay? Bob. We have to get out of here. Bob. Bob. Where the fuck are you going? Bob, talk to me. Oh, fuck. - Go to the end. - Okay. - Okay. - All right. - Some people are coming. Some very bad people. If they see you, you point this at them and you pull the trigger. If you run out of bullets, you just drop your gun, pick up the next one. And whatever you do, don't come out till I come get you. Gabi, I'm gonna go now. - Dad. Kill them. Kill all of them. - What the fuck are you doing?! Bring the fucking cars up. Everybody down the hill! - Case! - Hey, darling. You don't look so hot. - Fuck you. - Yeah, we'll get to that. - You're all out of bullets, sweetheart. - Dad. It was after midnight. My husband and I were in bed. The phone rang and somebody had information on Gabi. - Who? - I don't know. - John Lee got out of bed and he said he'd be right back. And that's the last I saw or heard from him. And then they found my baby in his trunk. So you never knew any of these people? - No. - And you? - Me what? - Is there anything else you want to add? - No. - We're sorry, Mr. Naci. It's just protocol. I understand, but watch your tone. I don't like the inference. This woman just lost her husband My best friend. - Can I steal these two for a minute? - Hello, Bob. - Hello, Arthur. - Bob, what's going on? - I'll have the truth now, Arthur. What did you do to John Lee? - What kind of thing is that to say? - You too, huh? Did you tell her you were there when the old lady got murdered? - I know what happened to the old woman. - Maureen, careful where you're going with this. - You watch yourself with me, Arthur, and I mean it. I've tasted a lot of blood lately, and I'm not sure I got a full stomach yet. Maybe it's easier in the dark. - Come on. Tell me. - Bobby, stop. - As long as we can't see faces, right? - You're scaring me. - Come on. What happened to John Lee? - My husband is dead. And just like I told the police, I don't know what happened to him. But I'll tell you this. Whatever did happen, I wish it happened a hell of a lot sooner, alright? Like last November. - You and your half truths. It's beautiful. - Bobby, that's what life is. Half truths. - Is it? - Sure. Just ask Errol Gray. No one's clean, son. No one. Now for what you did, to get Gabi back, you should get a medal. All of it. Yeah, I fucked up in the past, me and John Lee. But we never touched the old lady. When we went in that trailer, she was dead. We walked away, washed our hands of it, and we let the punk go, and that's the God's honest truth. - You're a fucking liar. You're both fucking liars. - We all lie. We all cheat. We all fail. But that's not what this is about, is it? You just took us down here to lay blame, isn't that right? To find fault. But who are you to blame? Hm? Blame is for the ultimate judge. And there is only one. - Jesus. I know. Only one. And he will judge us all. Hallelujah. - You want to break them down, don't you? Burn them at the stake. But be careful. Cyrus wants you to become a war junkie. So don't get too much at home. You got Gabi to think about. - Where are you in all of this? - I'm leaving. That's what I wanted to tell you, I'm going, tonight. - Going where? - Just going. - I don't want you to. - I know. - I, um, I did some digging. I know you didn't ask, but I figured, figured, what the hell? You never know. - You never do. - She did look for you, by the way. She looked hard. You know, private investigators, APBs, flyers, community service, local cop said she drove him crazy. After five years, it went cold, and she moved away. - Yeah. Thank you. I mean that. Even though I don't believe in any of your shit, I'd play Mary Magdalene just to get you off. And I would. Might even take a little blood. But I'd give you as good, man. I really would. Now do me a favor, Coyote. And let me go. - Take care, okay? - Relax. Finish up. Put your hands up. Walk out the door. Forget about it. Sit down. - What's with all the fucking drama, girl? Why not just do me while I'm pissing? We're in the heart of true country, so come on. Send me home. Oh, I get it. You want to see if the cock's feet are made of clay. Right, field hand? That prince must fall shit? Not happening, coolie. I'm not like those sheep whose whore you are. I don't pretend to be. I am my freedom. I wear it. You are nothing. You're just trying to buy yourself back with one bullet. - You're crossing over. And a part of me is going with you. - Officer, Hightower? - What's this all about? - We get this weird from a woman said to come out to this address, Said there'd been a murder and she gave us your name. Said you could identify the victim as the man who kidnapped your daughter. Is this the man? - Yeah, that's him. - Where is it? Yes! Hello? - Hey, Coyote. - Case, where the fuck are you? - I'm here.
