Could you make more noise? Sorry. Isn't that father's old cyclotron modulator? Yep. Dad was ahead of his time. All I have to do is adjust the energy capacitors ... then ... Oh no! What's wrong? It's a trap! Get Bailey out of here! ... Now! I'll kill every one of you. You butchers. Lord Vox. Go ahead, kill me. Pangea doesn't belong to you anymore. You and your kind left it behind. It's ours now and we will never give up fighting for it and nothing you can do or say will ever break my spirit. I love you. Oh perfect. It is written that we, the freedom fighters of Pangea who battle so valiantly for our world, will ultimately hang over the pit of defeat from which no one returns. Now there's a confidence builder. Don't worry Bailey, I will personally lead a raid to save your sister. - How? - I'm taking most of the men out tonight. We're gonna let ourselves be captured by Vox's men. Then, once aboard the mother ship, we'll take it over and free Tyra. What happens if Vox decides to kill you down here? Then ... then ... My son, it is written ... Where? Where is it written? You're always talking about prophecies and destinies, but my sister's gonna die and without her we all will, too. Oh, I love when you get scientific. My circuits are all a flutter. Not now, Illumina. But I can't help myself. You're brilliant. I mean only my Bailey could send an intergalactic S.O.S. and build a transporter to bring help from across the cosmos. I just hope it works, because somewhere out there, I know there's someone who can save us. I just know it. Hey Bailey, you might want to come see this. Do you think this is a response to your S.O.S.? I said your money or your life. I'm thinking it over. I don't know but the signal's point of origin is a planet 400 light years away. Behind you! Look at him. He's amazing! It's like he knows ahead of time exactly where the monster is gonna go. Thanks Cap. A few more seconds and I would have been a human shish kebab. But more importantly, Happy, justice has been served. You're right, Cap. Well, you destroyed the evil Lizard King so I guess our work here is finished. Perhaps, but if there's one thing I've learned, it's that Captain Zoom's destiny as Defender of the Universe was written in the stars. We can never rest in our continuing war against injustice and oppression. Together, we can be ... we ... must be ... we ... will be ... victorious! That's why Captain Zoom is here. The Adventures of Captain Zoom in Outer Space, a presentation of the Dumont Network. I think we found our man. Are we done? Excuse me, excuse me ... Wake up. Put this on. Now! - Hungry - No. You've been in that cold lonely cell for two days without food. Personally, I can't make it from breakfast to lunch without a snack. You look enchanting. Look, do I really have to wear this? It's not really me. Feel free to take it off. You make my skin crawl. You should accept my hospitality with a little more graciousness, Tyra. Why should I accept anything from you? Perhaps you would show more reverence if you were dead. But where's the fun in that. I'm sure we can come to some sort of understanding, one mutually beneficial to both of us. Think of it, Tyra. You could end the war, the misery, the bloodshed, today, right now, and that is only the beginning of what awaits you as my queen. Together, we could usher Pangea into a new era of galactic dominance. You're a lousy kisser. Yeah. Even in her dreams she resists me. She's stronger than I thought. Take her back to her cell, Dr. Yal-Tem. Yes, my lord. And now, a special announcement from Captain Zoom. After a life or death struggle like that nothing restores my energy cells more than a big glass of Chocko Socko. Tell your mom and dad to pick some up today. And remember kids, send in today for your own Space Rangers' patch, official membership card and decoder ring, just like Captain Zoom's. That's right, Happy. All you need are 25 labels from any Chocko Socko product and 10 cents for shipping and handling. And for you Rangers out there who already have your decoder rings, have them ready so you can understand my secret message. So remember kids, Chocko Socko is boffo. And now, we return to Captain Zoom and the Temple of Death. Now that's what I call a smooth landing. No time for celebrating, Happy. We must say the secret words to open the temple. I don't know about anybody else, but I have my secret decoder ring ready to go. Stand back, Happy. The secret words to open the gates to the lost temple are Oh no. ... are ... Hurry, Captain Zoom, hurry. Yes, Happy, I'm concentrating ... words are coming to me ... OFFOB SI ... OKCOS ... OKCOHC! Thank you for opening the temple, Captain Zoom. I'll take over now. Genghis Fon, you evil genius. How did you find us? A tracking device we put on your jovial sidekick, Happy. The secrets of the temple will be mine, now. Say goodbye, Captain Zoom. Is that in the script? The subatomic transport's working. I did it. Was there any doubt? Where am I? What the hell happened? Welcome Captain Zoom. You're on the planet Pangea. I'm sorry I had to bring you here without warning, but I need you to save my sister and her civilization. Didn't we do this episode in the first season? Wait, how did I get here? Well, it was a cinch to fold time and space and use your carrier wave to guide my transportation beam, but the only hard part was reconfiguring your brain waves so we could communicate. I know what's going on here. I'm on "This Is Your Life." Where's Ralph Edwards? Ralph, get out here. Where are you, ya old dog? We heard an explosion. Who's Mr. Fancy Pants? Put your weapons down. This is Captain Zoom. I brought him here to help us save Tyra. Is this true? No, I'm not Captain Zoom. I'm Ty Farrell. Maybe you read about my Oberon in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Hartford Playhouse? It was summer stock but most of the New York papers covered it. Ty Farrell, the actor? What's an actor? You know, I act. I pretend I'm somebody else for money. Ah, so you're a spy. Kill him. Whoa, hey hey hey, listen just a second, fellas. Now look, I - I don't know what I've done and I don't know who you are, and I don't know where I am, but you just can't up and kill me. Uh, sure we can. Ah, you - you've passed the test. Test? Yes, ah, I am Captain Zoom and I just wanted to be sure that I could trust you with my secret identity. That's Pangea. No, it's 100% cotton. I thought I might find you here. Given the fact these are my chambers I doubt if it was much of a strain on your psychic powers. I've come to take your mind off that Pangean whore. Wouldn't you rather be with one of your own kind? You're the high priestess of our people. It'd be like making love to my mother. I never enjoyed that. Vesper, I've reached a stalemate with these Pangeans. Just when I think I have won, they disappear into their jungles, eluding defeat for another day. Your psychic ability is the advantage I need to crush them and if you lose your pureness you lose your powers. I can't risk that. I need to take this world whole. I need Pangea. Your needs, we're always talking about your needs. What about my needs? The answer is "no." How long do I have to wait? Till the next priestess is old enough to take your place. She's only three and a half. What does it mean, what do you see? I see ... I see ... I see a new man among the rebels. He has defeated many enemies. He's a hero to millions. What else do you see? Tell me. His name is Captain Zoom. He comes from a distant planet. He has great powers. Where does he get them from? Chocko Socko Who is this ... Captain Zoom? Who is Lord Vox? Thousands of millennia ago, Zell, the terrestrial mother, and Gar, father of the cosmos gave birth to Rhea, god among men. Oh, oh, wait. This - this sounds long. Is there a Reader's Digest version? Rhea led this planet into its first golden age. But then the planet got sick. Thus began the time of the great dispersion. All right, let me make it simple for you. A lot of people who used to live here - left. You still haven't answered my question, who is Lord Vox? His race is the Vectrons. Their ancestors were among those who left Pangea thousands of centuries ago. He knows that this world, the beginning of all life, is the key to holding his power over his subjects. For somewhere on Pangea lie the great secrets of the ancients. Thanks for the Sunday school lesson. Now ... Tyra, is a prisoner of this Vox character? Yes, aboard the flagship in orbit around the planet. Well, why don't you use your spaceships to rescue her, then? We, uh, don't have any spaceships. Huh, and this Vox has a lot of soldiers, right? And many weapons. And you don't have any spaceships but you do have a handful of guys, a few guns, and a couple of horses, right?. We also have you. And our faith. Okay, I've given this a lot of thought and I have a plan to save your leader. But it's a plan that requires flawless execution and since I only demand perfection for myself, I must go alone. There goes a brave man. Oh, I can't believe this. What is going on? What did I do to deserve this? I'm going to talk to my agent, first thing in the morning. How the hell did I end up on another planet? I've never even been to Europe. Come on! Come on! Okay, she missed the episode where I defeated the Lizard King. Section one, stand by. Roger that. Who are you guys? I am Lieutenant Zorg. Thank God, the police. What a day. First I'm stuck in makeup for 45 minutes, then these loony rebels zap me across the universe, and then the Loch Ness monster here thinks I'm a shrimp cocktail.. Bring the big mouth to the ship. Be brave my brother, don't lose hope. Where are we? We're prisoners on Lord Vox's flagship. Oh god, no, no, please no ... Are you a warrior? No, I'm Ty Farrell, the actor. Somebody who pretends to be somebody else for money. So that's it, you're a spy for Lord Vox. I'm not a spy. Hitchcock wouldn't even see me for "Notorious." Well forget, it you'll never trick me into telling you the whereabouts of the rebel camp. Rebel camp? Are you Tyra? Yes, and if Vox kills me my people will find another ruler to lead them. That would be me. You? My people ... chose you? I have to get home. Well that's fine with me. I mean I don't even know what the hell happened. Seems like only yesterday I was enjoying room service in my suite at the Plaza Hotel, complimentary champagne, chateaubriand, Alicia the night maid ... Oh, I really feel for you. Personally, I wouldn't know what it feels like to give up such extravagances since I've spent my whole life engaged in a life or death struggle trying to preserve the homeland of my people. Gee, it's too bad that cute butt has such a big stick stuck up it. Oh, and I wanted so bad for you to like me. Listen lady, if it wasn't for you I wouldn't even be here. I didn't bring you here. No, but your brother did, to rescue you. Kudos on a job well done. You're here to kill him right. Quiet! Hey, listen fellas I don't suppose it would make any difference if I told you that Vice President Nixon's kids are big fans of my show. Lord Vox wants to personally interrogate you. And I'd love to, but I'm really trying to limit my personal appearances.. Thank you. Now, this just gets better and better. Hi. Listen, you look like a reasonable fella. What do I have to do to get out of here? Just ... tell the truth. What's your name? Ty Farrell. I love the smell of burning flesh. That wasn't the truth. Okay, Ty Farrell's my stage name. My real name is ... a Eugene Oshovsky. And where are you from ... Eugene? Well, I was born in Riverside, Iowa, but I just recently signed a lease for a small brownstone off Sutton Place. You may have heard of the previous owner, the grand dame of American theater, Helen Hayes. I was telling the truth. I know, stop embellishing your answers. Where were you trained? I took some night classes at the Academy of Dramatic Arts. Is there another Captain Zoom? No. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. There are a couple of guys that put on the suit for supermarket openings, but I do my own stunts. Okay, okay. Not all the time. I have a bad back. I didn't embellish. I know, I just don't like you. This is gonna be fun. For me too. Coach, you can't take me out now. My dad's out there and he may not get to see me play again. No, he's not sick. He's going on a cruise. Ah, Dr. Yal-Tem, and what did you find out about his weapon? It's a fake. See, all of his equipment's phony. But we're still working on cracking that code ring. This must be some cruel cosmic joke. Fry him. Fry him. Never, never, point anything at me. No, wait, don't destroy the prisoner yet. I need to probe his mind. But Lord Vox ordered me ... Listen, fathead are you going to question the high priestess of Val? Now, have him taken to my chambers. Yes, High Priestess. With a little time, I will have the answers to many mysteries. Mysteries.. It was all a dream, just a terrible dream. Now baby, I can't guarantee you a part on the show but they do like to keep me happy. What are you doing? I'm probing your mind? My mind's up here, sweetheart. What did you say your name was? I am Vesper, high priestess of the Psychic Sisters of Val, sorceress of the Vectron Order ... And apparently hornier than a rhinoceros herd ... ah I can't do this, I mustn't do this, it is the law. I have a responsibility to my people, my religion. You Catholic too? Ah, the hell with it ... You got another cigarette, I like to smoke afterwards, too. Vesper? My ... psychic powers ... ... no ... no You were ... you were great, baby. I'll call you. Hey! ... guards ... guards Let me go. Shut up ya little rat. Let me go. Not the face ... not the face. Oh please. Come on, we gotta get out of here. Keep moving, prisoner. Halt. State your business. This sniveling coward is going to lead us to the rebels. I'm to put him on the ship and await Lord Vox. I was not informed of this. Don't you want to capture the rebels? Yes, yes, I will bring Val to the rebels for I have waited my whole life to see these impudent turncoats brought to justice. Wait here. My whole life, dost thou hear? I heard. What the hell was that? It's acting, it's what I do. Well, you do it badly. Trouble on the main hanger deck. They're rebels, seize them! Hit the red auto drive button on the right. I said to the right! Is that my right or camera right? I'll hold them off. You get us out of here. Tyra, where's the clutch? Just want to steady. Excuse me my lord. I thought I told you never to interrupt me when I was in conference. Yes sir, but the prisoners have escaped. Tyra! I'm a little busy. This is way too easy. Fire! Whoa, this guy's good. We're being pursued. Energize the pulse ray emitter. Is that like turning on my high beams? Get up, get out. Sit down and start shooting. Now this I can do. I played a tail gunner in "Desperate Journey" starring Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan. It was a small part but it did a lot for my career. Shut up and fight. Hey, I nailed him. We're targeted. I got him right where I want him. Come on, hurry up. Say good night, Pangean scum. Fire! Come on. We gotta put some distance between us and that escape pod. Lady, I'm getting a little tired of you bossing me around. Listen to me, it'll be very easy for them to track down that pod. Now, move it. Don't push me. I've had a terrible day and my analyst is in another solar system. You hold them off. I'll go get help. Okay, okay, I'm innocent. Wonder Woman here took me prisoner. Ah Now what? My ankle, I think it's broken. You better go on without me. Okay. Wait! You can't just leave me here. Come on ... come on ... come on Come on! They're coming. Hail Captain Zoom. He saved our Tyra. This is a great day for Pangea. The evil plans of Lord Vox have been thwarted, thanks solely to the heroic efforts of a stranger from another time, Captain Zoom. Well, first I'd just like to say that I didn't do it alone. There really is another person I have to thank, the great acting teacher Lee Strasberg. And even though I wasn't accepted into his program, I still remember his credo; observe, listen, and react spontaneously, and I'm sure you'll all agree that today I passed the course. So ... I, uh, hate to eat and run but I really need to get back. Uh, what time does my flight leave? Um ... Captain Zoom, I can't send you home right away. You see, when I brought you here I used up all the xenon isotopes and it takes time for the new ones to decay to the necessary level of radioactivity. Great, I have time for dessert. So when are these isotopes going to be ready? In about ... 12 million years. Um ... Captain Zoom? Now, I was just wondering which one of those stars ... is home? Actually, it's that one. You know fate's a funny thing kid. What do you mean? Before I became Captain Zoom, I was just another chiseled profile in the crowd, an out-of-work actor with big dreams just about to give up and go back into my dad's aluminum siding business when fate intervened. The wife of a Chocko Socko executive saw me with my shirt off cleaning her pool and before I know it I was a household name. Now look at me. Seems like fate just can't leave me alone. I'm sorry captain. It's okay kid. At least I don't have the IRS on my back anymore. But I do feel sorry for all the folks back on the show probably just lost their jobs. Without me, there is no Captain Zoom. Smoking rockets, this new face will surely fool your enemies, Captain Zoom. That's right, Happy. Sometimes the gods let us carry the full weight of the choices we make. I was hoping that a power much larger than myself might share in the decision to surrender. Why surrender? For the first time in years, the people of Pangea have hope. But it's a false hope. When I was aboard Vox's ship I saw his armies, his determination. He won't give up and we're totally outmatched. It's suicide to go on. Tyra. I remember a problem your father faced similar to this. Vox had only just arrived back then and your father thought that surrender was inevitable. Why did he decide to fight? You were born and he couldn't bear the thought of his little girl enduring a life of slavery. Yes, well, there might have been hope then. Now there isn't. Yes, there is. Prophecy is being fulfilled. Pangea's new golden age is beginning. The signs are clear. What signs? The arrival of the Promised One. Him? You can't be serious. Prophecy says he will come from afar wearing the symbol of Pangea. It is written, he will make our enemies his enemies. I don't know Sagan. And with the arrival of the Promised One, we will find the lost temple of Rhea and there will our destiny be fulfilled. I find it hard to believe he is our savior. You must have faith. Captain Zoom is obviously more dangerous than I ever imagined. Why are you smiling? Am I smiling? I didn't realize. It must be because of my new vision, yes ... ... I see ... I see What ... what do you see? It's coming, it's coming. Don't rush me. Oh, I see it now. It's crystal clear. Oh, Lord Vox, you're really gonna hit the jackpot on this one. Will we ... kill many rebels? And how. I see many bodies, strewn across the ground, smoking, charred, from the relentless blaster fire. Yes, yes, I love it! Go on. Go on? Smoking from the fire, bodies, charred, strewn. What about ... Captain Zoom? You will easily defeat him yourself, in hand-to-hand combat, and hold his severed head up in triumph. Good ... very good. I thought so. My lord, we located the rebel camp. Excellent, send four legions to the location immediately, but have them wait for my command. I want a front row seat for the apocalypse. Won't you come out tonight, won't you come out tonight would you come out tonight, buffalo girrrrl ... won't you come out tonight. la la la la la Don't worry, I didn't see anything. Oh, we can fix that. Why don't you join me? We're leaving on a dangerous mission to find the lost temple of Rhea and we have no idea whether we're going to make it back alive. Well, send me a postcard. Vox is going to be furious about our escape and he's going to send everything he has after us. You won't be safe here for long. And how much safer am I going to be in the woods with you and your little road company of Brigadoon. All right, if you would rather spend the rest of your life living here on Pangea in fear and never see your precious Plaza Hotel again, it's fine with me. Wait - wait -wait. What do you mean? Well, Sagan told me that in the temple of Rhea, we will most certainly find a way to get you home. Home? New York? Cheesecake at Lindy's? Is this a trick? Maybe where you come from people resort to lies and trickery to bend the will of others, but that is not the Pangean way. Sorry, sorry, just give me five minutes to run a comb through my hair. Nothing yet, Lieutenant Zorg. Come on men, keep looking. The place is deserted. Here he comes. Bring me Captain Zoom. A clean getaway, and no one got hurt. Not a bad plan, if I do say so myself. It was truly inspired, Captain. I thought so. Don't you agree, Tyra that my plan was inspired? Yes, brilliant. I just hope it bought our people enough time to go into hiding. Oh, don't worry. It worked for me and Happy when we were trapped on that planet full of Amazons. The evil Empress Cleomanche was so busy looking for a stolen ship she didn't even notice the slave girls escaping. That sounds like an exciting adventure, Captain. Are you kidding? All those broads in loincloths? It was the smartest part ... I saw you burn down the camp. It was just as I pictured it. It was deserted, and they stole another one of my ships. I knew it. I saw that, too. You said you saw many dead rebels. You told me I would hold up the severed head of Captain Zoom. I don't remember giving you a time and a place. How you interpret my visions is your problem. Vesper! You said when you tried to probe Zoom's mind, he knocked you out, then escaped. That's right. He broke free of my mind hold and knocked me out. Then he said if I - if I tried to follow him he'd kill me. Of course, I wouldn't know he said that if he'd knocked me out but ... I have a Fansian coin in one of my hands. Tell me which one. Well done, Vesper. Shall we go for two out of three? This is insane. I'm not gonna stand here and waste the precious gift given to me by the great god Val on some stupid carnival trick. The coins in your right hand. It is one thing to betray religion, to betray your race. It is another thing to betray me. I had the privilege alone to take your power from you. To give it up for this insignificant meddler ... (inaudible) You shall pay. According to legend, the temple of Rhea's in the hidden valley of the ancients. Okay, where's that? It isn't on the map. That's why they call it the hidden valley. The temple was guarded by the gatekeepers. Prophecy says only the Promised One can gain access. But if it's hidden how are we going to find it? There's something directly in our path. It's Lord Vox. He's found us. No, it's not Vox. It's an escape pod and there's a distress signal coming from it. Bring it aboard. It could be a trap. Leave it alone. Sensors indicate there is a female life form aboard. Bring it aboard. One move and you're dust. Oh, please. Zoom! Oh, I thought I'd never see you again. You know him? Know him? Everybody, this is high priestess Vesper. Vesper this is everybody. The high priestess of Val, the spiritual leader of Vox's hordes? Her deadly sorcery is an abomination to our beliefs. See, she wears the Vectron amulet. It is written, this dark witch must die. Take a pill old woman. I've been banished by Vox, stripped of my position, cast out of my religion. My past is meaningless, my future uncertain. I have nothing but that doesn't matter cause now I have you. She's lying. According to the laws of Vox's religion, the only way he could banish her is if she had forsaken her psychic powers, and the only way that could happen is if she ... I'm tossing her out the airlock. Go ahead, but I could help you find the temple of Rhea. That is where you're going, isn't it? How did you know that? I used to have powers. Years ago I had a vision, a vision about the gatekeepers to the temple. What was your vision? That they live near the sulfur springs of Brunia. She's bluffing. No, the sulfur springs of Brunia are known only to the elders of Pangea. There's no way she could even know their name. Unless you were telling the truth. You better be right. Don't worry. We'll be in and out of that temple before Vox even has a chance to find us. We found them. Fire! We lost the main engine. We're going down! I knew we shouldn't have picked her up. Pull up! Pull up! We've got no power. Impact in - six - five - four - three two - one - impact! Good work. Lunch everybody. Well, can you do anything with it? Of course he can, he's a genius. I'll do my best but I've got no spare parts, none of the right tools, and the service manual's in another language. You can start work in the morning. Here, get some rest. Thanks. You try sleeping next to me, you won't wake up. Who said anything about sleeping? You know, it's comforting to know men are exactly the same even across the galaxy. You don't like me, do you? Oh, what's not to like? You're an unprincipled, self-centered jerk whose main concern in life is how his hair looks. My hair does look good, doesn't it? Oh ... You want me. It's written all over your face. I've seen your type before, you're just like Betty Davis in "All About Eve." Pardon? Oh, hard on the outside, but inside, scared and insecure. You're so busy being tough, taking care of everybody else, you never think about yourself. And that's all you think about. You talk about what a great actor you are. Why don't you try acting like a leader. You know, I usually don't have to work this hard with women. Look, I wish I was everything these people think I am, but I am not a hero. I just play one on television. That shouldn't stop you from trying. So, where are you bunking tonight? I don't think so. You guys going somewhere? Uh-huh, on a scouting mission. The sulfur springs are near here. Vesper recognizes the area from her visions. Stimulus and I are going to be gone for most of the day. We're taking the robot with us. I do have a name. I'm leaving you in charge. Think you can handle it? I managed a softball team for the Broadway Show League for two summers. I think I can handle this. We must be getting close, I can smell the sulfur. Can you smell it, Stimulus. Yes, I wasn't going to say anything. Warning! Warning! Life forms approaching. Which direction? From all directions, 50 meters away. Why don't I see anything? Unknown, now 40 meters away and still closing. 35 ... 30. They must be invisible. Shoot them. 10 meters. I still don't see anything. Nine meters. Where are they? Eight seven - six - five - four - three - two meters! One meter - they're here, they're here! The crash must have messed up her circuitry, she's clearly malfunctioning. Tyra! Somebody's got me. Grab hold of something What would you suggest? Tyra! I told you there were life forms. Hurry up, kid. So, I guess you're not mad at me anymore. No, not now that I have you all to myself. Look, Vesper, I don't want to give you the wrong impression. We had some fun, we shared some laughs. I gave up a sacred gift for you. And it's not that I don't appreciate the sacrifice, it's just ... I'm just not ready to settle down with one high priestess. What are you trying to say to me? Kid, how much longer is this gonna take? I was done a while ago, I was just listening. Hey, somebody help me, anybody. What happened, Illumina? Where's Tyra and Stimulus? I don't know. I can't remember. Bailey, help me. What's wrong with her? She's had a sensory overload. It's affected her memory bank Well, just slap her on the back. That's what I do with my TV. Illumina, try audio playback. That's Tyra. How would you know that? Oh, they're in trouble. What do we do? How can we find them, Bailey? I can reprogram Illumina's sensors so she can lead us to where they disappeared. Look, I don't want to end up dead. I say we should just let the kid fix the rocket and let's get out of here. She's got a point. It is written that if someone chooses to live as a coward, he chooses not to live. It is also written that a certain old woman with no fashion sense should butt out. We can't just give up. We have to at least try don't we? Listen Bailey, you want someone to entertain the troops, I'm your man. But leading rescue missions, fighting alien hordes, hey, I'm just wrong for the part. So you're not a hero. Just Monday through Friday, 4:30 to 5 Eastern Time. So that's it, you're just gonna abandon my sister and my best friend, just leave 'em out there to die? You're right. You're not the Defender of the Universe, not the Promised One, you're nothing. You know Bailey, nobody talks to Ty Farrell like that. I am a big star and I have my own TV show and everybody's always telling me how great I am. Oh, terrific work Ty, fabulous Ty, I don't know how you do it Ty. And you know what, after a while you start to believe it, but deep down you know the truth, and you're right kid, I am nothing, and I have some work to do on my character. Let's go save your sister, kid. Perfect. Stuck in the wilderness with the wrong pair of shoes. My sensors indicate this is where our comrades were attacked. Good, then we should learn from their mistakes and leave. Now, on Illumina's recording it sounded like they were being dragged away. Then why aren't I picking up any tissue traces along the ground. Perhaps they weren't dragged along the ground. What do you mean? Oh, don't fall for her act. She doesn't know. In religion school, they teach us to answer a question with a question. It makes us sound wise. Wait a minute, I think Sagan is on to something. I'm picking up a maze of tunnels underneath us. If they were dragged underground we wouldn't pick up any traces. Is there an entrance? 100 meters in that direction. Good work, Sagan. She didn't do anything. I've never heard of an underground race. There's nothing written about one in Pangean scripture. Guess we don't know everything then, do we? I just wish they get to the light so we can see what we're up against. Sometimes it's better not to know. Keeps you from thinking twice. I say we move in and hope for the best. Oh yeah, what are we waiting for. We've got an old woman, a bratty kid, a screwed up robot, an ego-mad womanizer. These guys don't stand a chance. Look, nobody asked you to come along and don't you ever call my Bailey a brat. And I'm supposed to listen to a trash can that talks. Perhaps if you would listen you'd learn something. Please ... enough! We've got to find Tyra and Stimulus. Who are you people? What do you want from us? I asked you a question. Who are you? Don't you want something to eat? Not if it's what they had. Here ... eat. Leave it alone. No one should ever see what Vox's torturers did to me. Oh, it's - it's - Ugly even to someone who can't see. No. You're so big and powerful but, your face, I feel such kindness. Love. My guess is that Tyra and Stimulus are locked up in those cells. We're gonna have to bust them out. What is your plan? We'll light a small fire, we'll generate as much smoke as possible, and in the confusion, we'll rescue Tyra and Stimulus. We'll be gone before the smoke clears. Think it'll work? Sure, we did it every season. That's the only decent diversion the writers came up with. It would have worked. I mean, who knew they didn't eyes to see? Careful, buddy. This costume was designed by two-time Oscar winner ... Greetings, Captain. Oh, Stimulus. Am I glad to see you. I thought I was gonna have to fight one of these people. Prepare to die, Captain. Stimulus ... I'm not horsing around. Somebody could get hurt. You catch on quickly. Oh great. You're excellent with the sword, Captain. Some of the best deals in Hollywood are made on a tennis court. Had enough? Stimulus, what's gotten into you? If I kill you, they'll let me live among them. Oh, this is wonderful, and they seem like such a nice people. You don't understand. In this land of the sightless, I'm not hideous. But I don't think you're hideous. That's because I've never shown you my face. All those who've seen it are repulsed. But you're judging me without giving me a chance. I won't be repulsed. Jeez Louise. So I was wrong, alright. Looks aren't everything. It's how you feel about yo... Go ahead, Stimulus. Finish me off if that's what you have to do. Huh, hey, maybe they'll let you kill the others, too. The people who accepted you, who never asked you to murder anybody just to prove your loyalty. I'm sorry, Captain. It's okay, Stimulus. Forget it folks, we're through putting on a show for you people. You want to see Captain Zoom fight, buy a TV set. Zoom ... Zoom ... Zoom ... Zoom ... Zoom ... Zoom ... Zoom ... Zoom Sorry guys, I don't have any eight by tens to autograph. Oh Promised One, Great Rhea instructed us to prepare for your arrival. We have waited uncounted lifetimes. Captain. These must be the gatekeepers. Uh, is - is that true? Can you tell us, uh, uh, the directions to the temple of Rhea? Is there another Captain Zoom? We can lead you no further. None of us has ever been beyond this point. It is written, only the Promised One will return from the voyage. The Promised One and his friends right? Thank you, Oh Promised One, for allowing us to fulfill our destiny. I thought it was a big deal when I was Grand Marshal of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. You know this boat doesn't really look big enough. I'll stay here. You are welcome here, sister. On second thought, let the kid and his girlfriend stay. Hey. No Bailey, she's right. It's too dangerous. I will come back for you. I know you will You know, if it's really gonna be that dangerous ... Sit. So long folks. Look. I never thought I'd live to see it, the coming of the Promised One memorized by the first high priestess of Pangea and handed down to each of her successors. So this is where it is written is written. I don't believe it, you really are the Promised One. I knew it. I prophesied it first. How could this be? I just can't ... that's me. They didn't get the chin quite right but that's me. How could this happen? The passage of time was an obsolete concept to the ancients. They were the masters of the past and of the future. But come on, of all the people in the universe they choose me, and my old man said I'd never amount to anything. Which way? Let's go to the left. That's the direction our scripture's always written from. Which direction does the Promised One want to go in? The Promised One ... says that way. We'll ride it out the Promised One. Look, the tunnel is ending. You made the right choice, Captain. Of course I made the right choice, I am the Promised One. Excellent choice, Captain. The Promised One does not appreciate sarcasm. Come, we must find the temple of Rhea Right, we have a prophecy to fulfill. Huh ... I say we go that way. Uh, Captain. Perhaps we should just go up these stairs. The Promised One concurs. Would you stop calling yourself that. What, it's written. Behold, the house of the great god Rhea. Could use a little landscaping. Hey, wait. I've seen these doors before. In your dream? No, no, in my TV show. It looks like the set of the episode I was doing when Bailey brought me here. What's happening? My hair, my hair. Hurry, Captain, time to .... I mean I ... Hurry, Captain, hurry ... OFFOB ... SI ... OKCOS ... OKCOHC! You remembered the words. I didn't need cue cards. All I had to do was remember how to say Chocko Socko is boffo backwards. Chocko Socko? The great Rhea. From him we will attain the power to free our people. Or ... Let's go, let's go. ... the power to enslave your people, depending on how you look at it. Excuse me, excuse me. How did you find us? I owe it all to my unceremoniously defrocked high priestess. I knew you were a traitor. We should have left you floating in space. I didn't lead him here, I swear. Of course you did, my darling. Your Vectron amulet is a tracking device You've got to believe me, I didn't know. Don't worry about it Vesper, they won't shun you for long. You'll all be dead in a moment. Doesn't Lord Vox prefer to torture and mutilate his victims before killing 'em. You seem familiar but I can't place the face. Perhaps you'd remember me if I was screaming in agony as your torturer seared the skin off my face with a white hot scalpel. Sorry, that doesn't really help narrow it down. Now, let's see. Who has pissed me off the most. That would be you, my love. However, I'll give you one last chance to share my throne. I would rather die a thousand deaths. Well, let me help you get started. God! Ah! Get up! Vesper. High Priestess. At least, I didn't die a virgin. Where was this written? Temper, temper, Captain. I've spared your life this long. Don't make me kill you before we finished. What do you mean, spared my life this long? For years I've studied the ancient legends of Pangea. I could have laid waste to the planet years ago, but how could I risk destroying some vital clue to its secrets. Then came Captain Zoom. Dear Captain Zoom, when you stole my Vesper's purity I knew then that you were fulfilling prophecy. I simply sat back and let you lead me to the grand prize. The power of Rhea. And now, I shall give you all the opportunity to witness my coronation. Coronation? Oh, dear Tyra, with the power of Rhea I can subjugate the weak and destroy all those who will not bow down before me. I will use their blood to paint a pathway of fear across the universe. You're looking at the next, the first Emperor of Everything! Can't decide, huh? Guess somebody didn't study his ancient legends hard enough. Is it the sword or the scroll? Which one will help you subjugate the weak or kill all those fools who don't bow down before you. Is it the sword, Vox, or is it the scroll? Hurry, Rhea doesn't have all day. Now, if it was me ... Will you shut up?! Fine, just trying to help. It's the sword. You're trying to trick me. You said that so I won't take the sword. The power of Rhea and it is mine! Come back, you fools. Great Rhea, is going to pay me his respects. What an unexpected pleasure. I've heard so much about you. I think I'm gonna be sick. This contains the secrets of the ancients. With it we can lead Pangea into a new golden age. How did you know to trick Vox into taking the sword? The pen is mightier than the sword. Another first season show. We got a Peabody Award for getting kids to read more. You see that? That's where I was born, that's where I went to school, that's where I used to look at the stars. Captain ... You don't have to say anything, Tyra. I know you lied about there being a way for me to get home. I didn't have a choice. Yes you did. But you made the right one. Captain, I swear to you, somehow, someday, I will find a way to get you home. You know, you'd like New York. Oh, first a Broadway show, no, then a hansom cab ride through Central Park, and then we'd sweep into 21 and all the heads would turn ... Because they'd all be looking at you. No, because no one on Earth has ever seen a woman as beautiful as you. Thank you. It's nothing, thank me later, when we're alone in your tent and you'll have one more reason to call me the Promised One. Enough. They want you to make a speech. You're their hero. And mine. Ah, well. I just want to say to you guys that, uh, well you've been great. I'm a little new here and you've really made me feel at home. And, uh, well, if there's one thing I've learned it's the Captain Zoom's destiny as Defender of the Universe was written in the stars. We can never rest in our continuing war against injustice and oppression. Together we can be, we must be, we will be victorious. That's why Captain Zoom is here.
