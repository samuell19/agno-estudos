This is the story of a time long ago, a time of myth and legend, when the Earth was still young. The ancient gods were petty and cruel, and they played mankind for their sport, plaguing them with suffering, besieging them with terrors. For centuries, the people had nowhere to turn, no one to look to for help, until... he arrived. He was a man like no other, born of a beautiful mortal woman but fathered by Zeus, king of the gods. Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart. But everywhere he went, he was tormented by his stepmother, Hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods. Hera's eternal obsession was to destroy Hercules, for he was the constant living reminder of Zeus' infidelity. No matter the obstacle, as long as there were people crying for help, there was one man who would never rest: Hercules! HERCULES THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS And the maidens... will cry to each other - Ah, Median. - Hmm. This time I'm gonna do it. I'm really gonna do it. Don't do it on my boots, they cost me five dinar. Ah. No, you idiot. I'm gonna talk to her. - To Critisa. - Yeah. Well, you always say that. All you ever end up doing is pouring more wine down your throat. Yeah, well, this time is different. There's her house. I'm gonna go up to her window..., and when she comes out to see who it is..., I'm gonna tell her I love her. You're crazy. What if that isn't Critisa's window? Why, then I'll... pledge my love to her sister and hope that she's pretty. Median, stop. Lover boy chickens out again, huh? Ah, no. Look! Stay here. Ledus? Ledus?! Ledus! Come on!!! We gotta get outta here!!! Hercules in the Underworld It's near the fresh cheese! Who are these men?! What do they bring to your tiny town?! Is it entertainment?! Is it opportunity? Perhaps it is the chance to win a prize. Well, ladies and gents, we've brought you all three! If you wish... If you dare..., take a chance and step into the ring... with Eryx the Boxer! Hey, how much do we win if we beat him?! Ah, that depends on what you'll put up. I'll pay you three times whatever you're willing to wager. I've got two dinar that says I'll beat you Eryx the Boxer. - I've got three. - I've got five. Ah, well, step into the ring, brave friend! But I warn you: Eryx the Boxer has never been beaten. Ah, that's because he's never ever faced any of us. Not so fast, friend. You paid to fight Eryx the Boxer. I thought this is Eryx the Boxer. Oh, no, no. This is Eryx the Boxer. I don't see him. W-Wait. You tricked me. This isn't fair. I thought the other guy was... Who's next?! You cheating bastard! Sestus was my friend! Well, come on! Come on! No! Don't do it. Quick. Go get Hercules. We need help. I'm gonna get it! This time, no! There he is. There he is. It's here! - Kill the lion! - It got me! Kill him! Kill him! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it! Kill it. Yeah! Daddy? - That was fun! - It didn't even scare us. Oh, please, can we do it again?! Hercules! Hercules! Hercules! We need you! Who's next?! What about you?! Or you?! Huh? What about you? What about me? - It's about time. - It was me you wanted, you didn't have to kill all these innocent men. I had to find some way to amuse myself. You know, you hard look like the strongest man in the world. - Sorry to let you down. - It doesn't matter. Your days are over! Then let's stop talking... and start fighting. Son! You should have seen that last one coming! Put your left up and jab, jab! Come on! - Your boy? - No, no. I'm just a spectator. Come on! Pump one left! Oh, now he's got him, now he's got him! - He won't keep his left up! - Yeah. Enough games, Hercules. I agree. Let's finish this. Come on, w-watch, watch, watch. Come on, Hercules! Woo! - You a fighter? - Me a fighter? No, I just, uh... I just fight with the devil sometimes! Right. Right! Oh, he's going better, huh? Yes! You won, Hercules. You're entitled to a prize. - I don't want any prize from you. - But this is special. It was pricked out... just for you. Hera, I thought we were through with these games of yours. I don't want to battle with you any longer. What do you say to a truce? Fine. If that's how you want it, we can always go back to the way it was. You were doing so well, my son. Why did you let it end like that? She's lucky that's all I did! It'll only make her angrier. Well, if you hadn't been unfaithful to her, she wouldn't be so mad to begin with. And you wouldn't have been born. Still... it doesn't make my life any easier, living under a curse. Curse? You've got a warm bed to sleep in, a lovely wife..., beautiful children. That's a lot more than most men have. That's... a lot more than I'll ever have. You should realize how... how lucky you are! Yeah, I do. You know, although I don't know if I would call it luck. I've had to fight damm hard for what I have. And you'll have to... work twice as hard to keep it, but it's worth it. And you know it. It's worth it. You know..., you ought to come and visit sometime. I'll try. Promise. Okay. Hey! You were great today. But don't forget... to jab, jab a little more and... duck! Don't forget... to duck now and then. I should have known Eryx was another one of Hera's tricks. What difference would it have made? You would've gone anyway, Hercules. That's who you are, people call for help - and you al... - ...and I always go, I know. Yes. I can't stand to see the gods play with people's lives, you know? Anybody's lives. I know that..., and I love that about you. You got this from that great lion. Now, what would the people of Nemea have done if you hadn't killed it for them? And the Hydra... that tormented the Lernaeans? What would have happened if you hadn't have come to their aid? And Tiphys. Hmm. Think of all the suffering he caused until you stopped him. And do I have to remind you what happened in Saenia? Nessus..., what am I doing wrong? Be patient, Hercules. You can't just... bully iron into shape. You gotta mold it, little by little, huh? Try heating it a little bit more. Hercules. - Hey. Hercules? - Huh? I think... the harness is hot enough now. I, uh..., guess I sort of got distracted. Sometimes I just can't believe they're mine. Know what I mean? Yeah. You're a lucky man, Hercules. Yeah. I'd say I am. Thanks. Dad! There's a girl coming! - Are you Hercules? - Yes, I am. What is it?! What's wrong? - What's happened? - I don't know. Bring her inside, quickly. - I need your help. Please. - Here. Drink this. There isn't any time. I've traveled days and nights to find Hercules. My village, Gryphon..., a hole has opened up. I-It's choking everything. What do you mean? What kind of hole? A hole breathing death. We've made sacrifices and offerings. But nothing's been able to stop it. I'm not sure that I could anything to help. You must! Please, you're our only hope. I've come all this way to lead you back with me. - Please, say you'll go. - Here. Get some rest. You need to sleep. So, what'll we drink to? - To our protector, Hercules! - May he live forever! - To Hercules! - To Hercules! Hercules, Hercules, Hercules... I'm gonna be sick if you all don't shut up about Hercules. Ah, shut your hole, Nessus. Hercules is the greatest! There's no disputing it! And none of us could even do a fraction of what he does. Of course not. But we're not half-god, are we? I-I work... and sweat and make offerings every day, and I'm just barely gettin' by. How fair is that? You're blind. You know that? Now, all of you. Just like Deianeira. Hmm. She praises him and fawns over him like we can do no wrong. He doesn't deserve her. He's gone all the time doing whatever he can to make his name bigger! I'm the one that takes care of her. And you better watch your... mouth, you... idiot half-horse. If Hercules hears about what's goin' on, there'll be a lot of... trouble. Damn Hercules. I-I-I'm not afraid of him. Not one bit. I have the goddess Hera to rely on. Huh? She watches over me, she's my protector. I've had enough of all of you. I'm going home before I hear his damn name raised again, huh? Who's there?! Who is that? What is it? Are you all right? You're trembling. I thought I saw something outside the window. Well..., you're safe now, there's nobody there. I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. Shh. Don't give it another thought. Just lay back and try to get some sleep. Is Hercules gonna help my village? - Is he gonna come back with me? - Yes, I think he is. Thank you. Thank both of you. Good night. Nessus..., what are you doing? You see this? It's perfect. Ah, it's absolutely perfect. Yes. Well..., let's just leave it for now. Ah, you don't believe me, do you? That I can do something better... than Hercules? I believe you, Nessus. It's just that it's late. I was surprised you could even sleep, what with that... girl here to take your precious husband away. Nessus, what's wrong with you? With me? It's what's wrong with you, that's the problem! You don't really trust him, do you? You can't really believe that he'll be faithful. My husband? I'm sure of it. Oh, come on. They'll be alone together. Now, Hercules is what Hercules is. Think. Her smooth skin, her glowing hair..., - her youth... - That's enough, good night. I bet there's something else I can do better than Hercules. Now... get out of my way. Go sleep it off. He'll have her. You'll see. Whoo! Looks like a good day to travel. I was afraid we might have rain, but it looks like we're be just fine. I hope that's enough to get you there. - Hey. - Hmm? What's wrong with you? Nothing, I'm fine. It's just... It's just that I'm gonna miss you, that's all. I'm gonna miss you too. Hey, Nessus, let's go! Why don't you go give your dad a big kiss goodbye, okay? I want to thank you for taking such good care of me. I was in a pretty horrid state when I arrived. Well, it's nice to see that you're feeling better today. Oh, here. I want you to have this. No, absolutely not, Iole. I can't accept this. Please, Deianeira. It would make me very happy if you'd accept it... and wear it. All right, then I will. Thank you. - You'll be good? - Yep. - You promise? - Yep. - Yeah? You'll miss me? - No. No?! - You ready? - Yeah. Bye, Dad! Come back soon! Chickens! Chickens! Chickens! Here's chickens! Chickens! Chickens! Two dinar! Two dinar! Fresh bread! You'll never buy better! Fresh bread. Hot from the oven! Fresh bread! You get bread here now. One dinar, one dinar! Only one dinar. My deepest sympathy. I'm so sorry. I'm afraid I don't know what you mean. For the loss of your husband. My condolences. My husband's fine. But... you have the medallion. That tells me you've lost your husband. No, this was just a gift. A gift... from a sweet, beautiful girl? Yes. How do you know that? Do you know her? I knew one like her once. She's a Nurian maiden. Still, why would you think my husband was dead? When a task need be done, these beautiful virgins can persuade a man to attempt it! No, not Hercules. She has no power over him. Now if you'll excuse me... She has power over all men. From the moment of birth, she's trained for this and only this. She knows all there is to know about... love, charm and seduction. She'll make your husband fall in love with her. And... when he does..., he'll do everything she asks..., even though it... leads him to his death. No, you're wrong. This medallion doesn't mean anything. I tried to tell myself that once. Deianeira, I don't think you should go. She's just some old crazy woman. But the things that she said! She knew! And I have to warn Hercules. But it could be dangerous, and you're not even sure you know the right way. Please, just take care of the children. That's all I'm asking. - Aeson, come here. - Why? I have to go away for a while, but I'll be back soon. Your aunt Althea's gonna take care of you, but you're a big boy. You're gonna take care of your brother and sister, all right? - Okay. - I love you. I love you too, Mom. - Bye, sweetie. - Bye. How's it look down there, Nessus?! Any better?! No! I've been all the way to the bend! It only gets deeper! This is probably the best spot to cross! I'll get Iole! Your beauty's so strong it charms even the animals. It guess it shouldn't surprise me. Deianeira, what's wrong? I know all about you, Iole. I know about your breeding, your training, and how you have the power to make men fall in love with you. How you'll make a widow and orphans out of a loving family, but please, call this off. Leave my family be. I can't. Deianeira, what are you doing here? Look, I've come to warn you. Thank the gods you're all right! Warn me? What are you talking about? You've been tricked. We've both been tricked. You know this medallion, the one Iole gave me? It means that she's Nurian maiden. Deianeira, I know. I've known since she first arrived. - And you're still going with her? - It'll be all right. But she'll take you away from us and we'll never see you again. - Deianeira. - No, please, please, just come home with me. She has these powers, and she'll make you fall in love with her, and once you do, you'll be willing to die for her. All this talk about Iole's powers and dying, it's nonsense. There's only one person in the world I'd die for, and that's you. Let me go and do what I can for Iole's people. Then I'll hurry right back home to you, I promise. At the very worst..., I'll have a new scar or two to show you. Now get yourself home. Nessus will go with you to make sure you get there safely. We better get going. Good-bye. Funny, isn't it? You travel all this way because you love him so much and care for him so much, and still, where are you? Alone, watching as he leaves with her for a second time. Nessus, be quiet. Hercules has a job to do. But why this job? Ask yourself that. Why has he chosen to abandon his family... and go off risking his life for this stranger, hmm? Could it be... because she's a young, beautiful... virgin? Hmm? Look at the way he carries her. Look... the way he holds her. It's tender... like a lover. He used to carry you that way. Do you remember? Hmm? Or is it too long ago? It's time to go. If you were mine, Deianeira, you'd never be alone. Let's go of me, Nessus, right now! Or when Hercules gets home, I will tell him about this and will tell him about the other night! Nessus?! There's only one way to get through to you, one way... to make you see things clearly like I do. Nessus, stop it right now! I should've done this a long time ago. There's no escape... and you know it. So relax. You just might enjoy it. Hercules! Help! Hercules! What are you screaming about?!!! Help! Help!!! There is no Hercules!!! - Hercules, what is it? - Keep quiet. Hercules! He's gone. In fact, he's as good... as dead. Hera. I'm dying. You were supposed to protect me. Deianeira. What vile thing have I become to have done this to you..., to end up like this. It was only because I love you. I couldn't stand knowing the pain..., the unhappiness he'd bring you. But he won't. He'll be true to me. There is a way you can be sure of that. But I am sure. Listen to me. My blood is a powerful potion. Give the cloak to Hercules. Once he puts it on, he'll never be unfaithful to you. I told you, I don't doubt him. Oh, but you do. Be sure. Give it to him. Deianeira! Are you all right?! I'm fine! - This is my fault. - No, everything's okay. We'll head back, head back home tonight. - No, you just go on. - Deianeira, I'm not...! No, you must go on! Hercules? And then take this. And when it gets cold at night, I want you to wrap this around you and think only of me. I'll think of nothing else. I'm tired of talking about me. I want to hear more about you. Tell me some stories about the great Hercules. Ah, there's not that much to tell. I just... do what I do. Besides, I want to know more about you're being a Nurian maiden. You haven't told me why you decided to become one in the first place. Well, it wasn't really my decision. Before I was born, my mother had a vision. And it told her that one day I'd be called upon to save my village. And in the vision I was wearing a blue stone medallion. Hmm. So she and my father sent me off to train as a Nurian maiden. And... here I am. What about the stories I've heard... of your special powers and all that? Well, that's nonsense, fools' talk. You, of all people, must know how that is. I mean, according to the stories about the great and powerful Hercules, you're supposed to be ten feet tall. - Hmm. - Huh. Some of the crazy things they say you've done: did you know that you supposedly slew a two-headed giant? And that you killed the Lernaean Hydra by yourself? Or best of all, someone once told me that you killed an enormous sea monster by squeezing its heart until it stopped beating. But those stories are true. No, I... I mean it, I really did all those things. So maybe Hercules does have a tale or two after all. Come on. Tell me a few more. That's enough stories. We'd better get to Gryphon. Oh, look, there's an inn. We can get something to eat. I think you'd better stay out here. - What happening here? - I don't know. Came in, set down his soup, then out of the blue he starts screamin'! He just went crazy! Started... smashing the place up! Did he say what he was mad about? No! No, he didn't say anything. Hey, now, that's enough! Stop! - Iole, what are you doing? - You're only scaring him. Scaring him?! He's gone crazy! He'll turn this place into splinters if I don't stop him! No, please. Put the club down. Let me talk to him. Hercules, put the club down. It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you. It's all right. There, there. What's the matter? I think he burned his mouth on his food. He would've said something, but he can't speak. Can someone get him some water? Not everything needs to be killed. Sometimes kindness can work too. Oh! Be careful. - You all right? - Yeah, thanks. Come on. It's beautiful, isn't it? Yeah. A lot of stars out tonight. Myrea and Martumus. Every time I see them, it makes me sad. - Which ones are they? - Right up there. - Right where? - Right up there. Here, I'll show you. They were lovers once... or would have been. Their families were at war and kept them apart. They were never allowed to see each other..., never allowed to touch. Well, why didn't they just run away? They were going to. They'd it all planned out. They were gonna meet in the meadow and finally be together. Myrea's father found out. He was so enraged. And when Myrea refused to denounce her love for Martumus, he was so filled with spite that he killed her. - He killed his own daughter? - Uh-huh. He tossed her body into the heavens. See? That's her, reaching out. And what happened to Martumus? Well..., he went down to the meadow to wait for her. Naturally, she never came. And then by chance he looked up into the sky and there she was. What did he do? Did he... get revenge? - Did he kill her father? - No. He was so wracked with grief... that he drew his dagger and cut his own heart out. He had to stop the pain. Luckily, the gods saw what happened. Out of pity, they drew his body up into the heavens. See? That's him... reaching out towards Myrea. But they're not touching. No. In a cruel twist of fate, he landed just out of reach of her. And that's how they'll spend eternity. They know they'll never touch, but they'll never stop trying. It's sad, isn't it? I guess I'm just silly. Good night, Hercules. Oh, yeah. Uh... Good night, Iole. Hercules! You know you shouldn't be watching me. Come on, Iole! It's getting late. Iole?! You don't deserve to live, you bastard! Whoa! Who are you, friend?! Why are you attacking me?! I'm not your friend! Fine! But what's your name, kid? I like to know who's tryin' to kill me. I'm not a kid, either. You're not a friend and you're not a kid, but I don't remember crossing you. Doesn't matter, you'll remember dying by my hand. Now, that's enough! I'm not gonna dirty my fists on you. - You're not? - No! You can go find someone else to kill. Now, I'm warning you. The next thing to break is your neck. Hercules, don't kill him! Poor Lycastus! Is there something you want to tell me? I told him not to follow me, but he can't help it. - He doesn't understand. - Doesn't understand what? That even though I love him, there isn't a future for us. - Well, why not? - There can't be. It's not in my destiny. But if you love him, and he obviously loves you... It doesn't matter. There are so many more important things in the world. My life and his life mean nothing. I don't want this to affect anything, Hercules. Saving my village is still the only thing that matters to me. Come on. Let's go. My town isn't that far off. We're close now. It's just up here. There it is. It's even worse than when I left it. Get out! Out. It's him! Iole's back, and she's brought Hercules with her! Hercules! She brought him! - You'll save us now! - Of course he will, he's the strongest man in the world! Come with us, Hercules. We'll take you to it. - What is this thing? - That's the underworld. There's nothing down there but death. I need to know something. Am I immortal or not? - Hercules... - I've never asked you before, but as your son, I'm asking you now. Can I die? - You don't wanna know. - I have to know. You're a god, my mother's mortal, what does that make me? It's a question you shouldn't be asking. But I have to know what will happen if I go into that hole. Will I ever get back home again? So don't go into the hole! Go home right now! You don't have to save this town! You don't owe anything to these people! Just turn around and leave! Go home and grow old with your family like you intended to. Tell me. Damn it, Father, tell me! All right. You... are mortal. Hercules..., you can die. How do I know you're telling the truth? - Why would I lie? - To keep me out of that hole. You're afraid what might happen to me if I go down there. You wanted an answer, I gave you an answer! Who knows if it's... the right one? What's he doing? He's just standing there. - Why isn't he doing anything? - You know your fate if he fails. You're getting ready for him, aren't you? Please, Iole..., don't. Lycastus, you've always known this day would come. This is my destiny. I thought you loved me. I do love you. And if you love me, you'll let me do what I have to do. - But what about us? - There is no "us". No! We can't. I can't. - But you want to. - Iole. You've gotta hide, quick. Hercules, I've been waiting for you. Iole, I'm afraid I can't help your town. I stood on the edge of that hole and I thought about it long and hard. If I go down there, I may never come back. I have children now, and a wife I love. I have to live for them. Hercules, my people suffer. They need you. I need you. Iole..., I can't. Please, won't you do it for me? Say you'll do it for me. No! Please..., don't. I have to go home and... be with my family. I don't want... anything more to do with the gods and their games. I just want to be left alone. If you're not gonna save my town, then I will. - I'll go in that hole. - No, you won't. It wouldn't do any good. - You'd only be killed. - It doesn't matter. I'm dead anyway. I failed my mission and I'm dead. I'm sorry. Lycastus. You take care of her, my friend. Help him! The gods will never stop!!! Hera!!! Mommy, Mommy! Daddy's coming home! Come on, let's go inside. Go, go! Right away. He's dead, isn't he? My husband..., he's dead? How? What happened? It was a cloak. A cursed cloak. He put it on... and it tortured him..., drove him mad! His only escape... was to jump into the hole. That cloak was supposed to protect him..., it was supposed to protect us! I've killed him. Hey, you there. Where am I? What is this place? Answer me, I'm talking to you. Oh, you're talking to me. Yeah, well, of course you're talking to me. Who else in Hades would you be talking to? I'm the only one here. Well, where is "here"? It is, uh, customary to pay the boatman for passage. Huh? Wait, what are you doin' here? - You can't go across. - Why not? Why not? Because you're still alive, that's why not. Only the dead are permitted to cross the River Styx, huh? Well..., we're gonna chance that right now, aren't we? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We can't. "Can't"? You know, when I say "can't", I mean, you're a regular kind of guy. I guess, uh, we could, uh, you know, maybe talk. Yeah, okay. Hades is not gonna be happy about this, let me tell you. No one alive has ever entered the underworld before. You're gonna be in big trouble when he hears about this. What am I sayin'? I'm gonna be in big trouble. I don't know why someone who's alive like you would wanna come down here. Hey, what's the matter, huh? You lookin' for someone? Someone lookin' for you? Woo! - There goes another one. - Another what? What was that? Ah... The damn dog, Cerberus. He's supposed to guard the gate, you know? Keep the dead down here where they belong. But he's gotten loose somehow. Now he's running around all over the place causin' all kinds of trouble. Aye, yay, yay, yay, yay. You know..., can't imagine what it must be like up in the living world. Yeah. Well, I can. So, uh..., how 'bout it? A little, uh..., somethin' for the effort? Sorry. Can't help you. Hey! At least give me my lantern back. Maybe a little later. Thanks for the ride, dude. Oh yeah, that's great! Very funny! A real comedian there! Yeah, why not pick on Charon?! Everybody else does! I don't know. Times are tough. [...] [...] Take a ride, don't pay you nothin'. [...] Cerberus. Who is the mighty Hercules going to help next? I don't know. Do you have someone in mind? Friends? Sure. What else would we be? What is it?! What's wrong?! - What's happened? - I don't know. Bring her inside. Deianeira. Hercules. Deianeira. My love. It is you. Help me, Hercules. - I don't belong here. - Neither do I. - None of us do. - A kiss would set us free. Yes. Just a kiss. Who are you? Deianeira. Deianeira. Great. There he is! Hercules! Well, well, look who we have here. Hercules! Recognize us? You sent all of us here! I can't believe you, Dragos. Standing side by side with Eryx? Even after he killed your mother? What? You killed my mother? Oh, he... forgot to tell you? Sorry. She was too ugly. You oversized bastard!!! Syphon! You'll let him get away with that? Dragos was a friend of yours. He was my best friend! Bastard! Going somewhere, Herc? Well..., I thought about it. Damn! Throw it down. Fight me like a man. Sorry, Eryx. I'm only half man. Oh, I just can't seem to get rid of you, can I, Hercules?! Even dying wasn't good enough. How'd you like the cloak? Did it fit okay? Hope it wasn't at all... uncomfortable. You... Do you realize what a fool you are? - Hmm? - What happened to you, Nessus? Gee. You're an even bigger fool then I thought you were. I always hated you. I saw you for what you really are. - And what's that? - An arrogant bastard who feeds on the praise and adoration of those who fawn over you, praise and adoration you never deserved. What's the matter? Do my words suddenly fill you with hurt? No. No hurt. Pity. And why is that? Because when all is said and done..., you're dead..., and I'm alive. I'll go home to my wife and family while you'll suffer down here forever. Hmm. You don't have a wife! Deianeira is dead. She's here now..., in the underworld with us! - I don't believe you. - No? I'll show you. The Elysian Fields... far from here. Ah, don't turn away, I want to enjoy this. You... damn bastard. - You're the one to blame. - Actually, it was Hera's plan. She deserves the credit. Poor Deianeira. When she realized the cloak had... driven you to your death..., she was so overcome with guilt..., - she killed herself. - No! Now whose turn is it to pity who?! Please... Let me see her one more time! Just for a moment! I think I will... only because I know how much it's gonna make you suffer! Please, do it. Look, Hercules. You're never gonna touch her again..., never hold her. But I guess you already know that, huh? Guess again. - Deianeira! - I'm sorry? Excuse me. Deianeira! Deianeira. I can't-I can't believe I found you. I'm... I'm... I'm sorry. Am I supposed to know you? What do you mean? It's me! Hercules. I'm your husband. I'm afraid I don't remember. How can you not remember? I mean, you have to remember! We love each other. Hercules. You shouldn't be here. Hades. What have you done to my wife? She can't remember me. What's wrong with her? Nothing's wrong. I've merely erased the misery that brought her here, that's all. I've given her peace. Now, you must go. Your time hasn't come yet. But her time hasn't come either. Oh, I'm sorry, my friend, it has. I lifted her broken body from the rocks myself. Well, you made a mistake. She's going back to my world with me. - That's impossible. - Nothing's impossible. Damn it! Look, uh..., I'd really would like to stand here forever and debate this, but, uh, you've chosen a bad time. Uh, I've got a lot of things to worry about, okay? You really should go... back to the land of the living. Not without Deianeira. But she's happy here! This is a magnificent place! Look around you. There's nothing but beauty and goodness here. It's her reward. To take her away now would be... selfish. And besides..., even if you could take her, you can't restore her memory. Deianeira. You've got to try. Deep down, it's all there. Please. Say you remember me. I'm sorry, but I can't. Think about our home..., about our children. - Our children? - Yes. Aeson and Klonus. And little Ilea. You have to remember them. Ilea? I wish I could. I can't... You can. Hercules? Hercules. Take me home. Take me home. Hercules! I'm very happy for your little reunion, really, I am, but, uh..., she still has to stay. - What if we make a deal? - A deal? Now, what could you possibly have that I would want? Your underworld's in chaos. If I'm not wrong, it's because Cerberus is running loose. Yes. I'll catch him and will return him to is post... if you agree to let Deianeira return with me to the living. My best hunters are chasing that dog and they haven't been able to capture him yet. What makes you think you can do it? I wanna know if we have a deal. Will you allow Deianeira to leave with me if I catch Cerberus? Fine! Fine. You return Cerberus to his post and you and your wife may leave. However, if you fail..., she's mine... forever. Don't worry. I'll come back for you. I won't leave you behind this time. Where can I find him? You two go that way! - Move! - Out of the way or die! This way! Back off, don't get too close. We've got you, you miserable beast! You're not gonna get away from us this time, you mangy hound! I'll give you the switch! He's getting loose! I had his one head. Hey. This is my leg. No, no. That's my leg. Smell that. - Yeah, that's your leg! - Thank you. I hate when that happens. Hercules! What the hell are you doin' here? I've come to get Cerberus. What makes you think we need your help? What makes you think you don't? - Do you mind? - Sorry. We'll catch the freak dog on our own, Hercules. Sooner or later, he is ours. Good to go! All right, guys. Come on. I hear him! Hey, wait! He went this way. Wait. This puppy's ours. You get him and club him if he comes out. Hey, boys! He's in the cave, let's go get him! Let's go. No! This way! I can smell him again! What's that? You hear him? Where the hell did he go? Get ready! Ha! Finish him off now, Hercules! - Take him out! - Kill him now! Make him suffer, Hercules! What's wrong? Pick it up! He'll kill you! Pick it up! Pick it up! Look... I don't want to hurt you. You just need to go back to where you belong. So, what do you say? Will you go? Remember that. Sometimes a little kindness does the trick. Now stay. Deianeira. - Hercules. - Deianeira. I missed you, I missed you. I wasn't gonna lose you. He's done it! Hercules has done it! The town's been saved! Our town's alive again! You saved us, Hercules. You saved our village. I don't know what else to say except "thank you". You don't have to say anything else. I... You don't have to say anything to me either. You did what you had to do. Because of it you saved a lot of lives. I still feel like I owe you an apology. So, uh..., what are you gonna do now, Iole? Well, I think Lycastus and I will start a family of our own, if we can do half as well as you have. You'll do just fine, I'm sure of it. Thank you. Now... let's go home. - Thank you, Hercules! - Hercules! - How'd I do, kids? - You got three! Still wondering about your... mortality? - Should I be? - I don't know. Just because you came back from the underworld doesn't ment you're... an immortal. - Doesn't mean I'm not. - True. To tell you the truth, I don't think I really care if I live forever. Everything I need is... right here and now. You've got a point. I'm sure I'd feel the same way if this were... - my family. - I heard that. Oh. What are you talking about, huh? This is your family. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Grandfather, look. Look what I've got. Oh! - What is that?! - An apple. An apple? Isn't that the nicest apple you've ever seen? Want a bite? Come on! - Hercules! - Go on, take a bite. Hercules! We need you!
