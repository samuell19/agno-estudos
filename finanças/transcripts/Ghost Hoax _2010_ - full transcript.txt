**Humming** Go on- LOOK AT 'EM. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Fuck a duck. Big AND crazy. Doesn't add up. Come on, man. What? I'd be freakin' out too if I knew I was going to the chair. I dunno. He was scared of those pictures or something. We seen worse. Remember the little girl with her head cut open? Yeah, that was bad. Or that pregnant woman- Yeah, but he acted different. Like he seen a ghost or something. That's where I seen him before-on TV. Him? You remember- we seen him on the news before. 'Bout six months back. He caught a ghost on video. No shit? Yeah, it was a big dealin the Valley for a couple of weeks. He said he found a real haunted house. Said he had proof. Maybe you're right. What-'bout what? Him. He's crazy. Like I said before. Big and fucking crazy. ** Whistling ** POPPA! What are you doing? Didn't know where you'd got to. I told you I was taking a shower. You were gone so long... I... I've gotta go to bed. Just gimmie a second, ok? Go back to bed and I'll give you your pills in a minute, ok? Poppa? POPPA! Poppa! Look for me... WHAT?! POPPA... POPPA... Poppa... Please come in, Dr Fratini-I'm so glad you're here-Thanks again- Not at all, Mrs. Tijeras. I couldn't wait to come down. I don't even know where to begin- Come on in. Like I was telling you over the phone- It all started when my father- Not yet, Mrs. Tijeras. We have to set up the camera. All this has to be properly documented, you know. OOOh-I'm so sorry. You're scientists. I understan- Oh no-just me. These two are just camera people. They're not involved in actual scientific investigation. Hi... Let's find a suitable room for the boys to set up in. Um... ok... There's the kitchen over here... We'll just go and get the other bags, then. Um... ok... I dunno dogg, this don't look like no haunted house. Well, what the hell do you expect a haunted house in the Valley to look like? I dunno... dark? Yeah? Yeah-and creepy. Yeah? Yeah and bigger- like a mansion or something. SHUT UP, Grover You have no idea what we're looking at, here-do you? If we play this the right way, we won't have to do another one of those god damn wedding videos EVER. What's wrong with weddings? Jesus Christ, Grover. I like weddings. And bridesmaids. Let's just get the rest of the damn gear... **Faint whistling..** (sarcastic) Haunted house... So, I all started- Now? Is it ok to start, doctor? Rolling. Please-call me Maureen. Go ahead and state your name and then tell us about your experience. Ok, Dr Fratini-I mean-Maureen. My name is Mrs. Teresa Tijeras and my house is being haunted by my late father, Paul Roulet. You know what-let's just take it one step at a time, Mrs. Tijeras. Can you give me a description of the occurrence that prompted you to call me at the university? Well, there's been weird things going on in the house over the past few months, but nothing like what happened... last week. Um... It was about two o'clock in the morning and- Excuse me, Teresa. Could I get you to look into the camera. No, I don't want that. Just relax and look where you want to look. Fine. Um-I'm sorry-um-It was about three o'clock in the morning and I was sleeping- and I heard this noise- there was this whistling- No-yes-there was this... So it was noise that first alerted you to the presence? There was this whistling-in my ear- I wasn't very loud- What was the tune? The tune? Yes. What was it whistling? Let's come back to that, later. We'll hold off on our questions until you're done with the account. (sarcastic) OK. Oh... anyway... where was I? The whistling... Yes-thank you. There was this whistling-by my ear- and then the whistling stopped and then suddenly I felt a sharp pain in my side. Like a jab-but I didn't feel 'the hit.' 'The hit?' Yes-like someone hiting me with a stick, but I didn't feel 'the hit, ' I just only felt the sharp pain in my side- Is there a bruise? Well, there was, but it's gone now. I'm sorry. That's alright-we'll just recreate it with some makeup. You look at little drained, Mrs. Tijeras. Let's take a little breather Tom, can I have a word with you? What the hell was that supposed to be? Look, I just thought a little bruise would be good for the dramatization segment. I don't think we're on the same page here, Tom. I've hired you two to document everything that happens in this investigation. But don't you want it to look good? I mean documentaries now a days-the audiences want to see something with a little bit of a pizzaz. I don't know how much more clear I can be with you. YOU ARE HERE TO DOCUMENT. We're not making a documentary and the people who are going to see this want accuracy above all else, or they will not give us money to continue. The last thing in the world we want is 'pizzaz.' Ok-ok. Yeah-you're the boss. I'll just document. No pizzaz. I'd appreciate it. Now that we've straightened that out, Im going to go find Teresa. You go find your sound guy. What?! DAMNIT. What the fuck, slackass? Hey. Whoa. Huh? What? You know what- What are you doing in here? Oh yeah my pal here- wasn't feeling so good so uh- I heard something. I don't think we should be in here. Why not, Teresa? What happened here? This is Poppa's room. This is where he stayed. How long? Only two months. He hardly ever left the room, thank god. Were you close to your father? Oh god no. I hadn't seen him since I was five. And then he just showed up here... and... died... Have there been any unusual goings on or incidences in this room since your father passed? Sometimes I hear noises. Late at night I'd hear a song-a a record he used to play- over and over again. But when I get up- The record player would be unplugged? Oh no. I never get up to go check. What? Why not? Because I smashed that record into a thousand pieces the day after he died. I only get up to lock my door and try to get back to sleep... Well, what do you think? I don't know. Seems a little fishy to me. I think she's genuinely scared of something in there. What-you don't think she's doing it just for the attention? She doesn't seem the type. She wasn't all that forthcoming about any of the incidents. I believe she is really afraid. Yeah, I guess... And what about you friend? What? Grover? Has he ever displayed any kind of sensitivity before? Only when he's working on some chick. No, I mean like sensitivity to psychic phenomenon. Naw. He's just all hung over. Working on some puta last night- - kept him up all night... Hey Grover, what was last night's name. Your momma. I don't know. Something's going on with him. He's just going to break your heart, Maureen. I wasn't talking about that. But what about your group? They going to come do more work in the- I mean-did we get enough on tape? I'm not sure. After you send me the copies of the footage, then I'll show them to the board and they'll make a decision from there. Well how long's that going to take? Who knows? Tomorrow-two months from now...? They're very picky about what they decide to fund and right now we just don't have a lot to show them. I told you it wasn't a sure thing. You understand. Yeah... sure... Look, I think we have something. I just wish we had something more. I'll call you when I know anything. Yeah... I'll see you later... We all done for the night? What-you got plans tonight or something? Yeah, I'm going to the bar with a girl- Not tonight, rockstar. We're gonna work us a little graveyard tonight. STOP IT! STOP IT! POPPA! POPPA-STOP IT!! Get that sun gun ready. She's almost there. AAAAAAHHHHIIIIII! Good fun. Yeah? Tom, it's Maureen. Something happened at the Tijeras house last night. Something big. What, did Teresa freak herself out again? I don't think this is her imagination. The occurrence she is describing is a little too vivid to dismiss. She's absolutely terrified. I'll take your word. Not my field. Just see if you can get a hold of Grover and get all your camera equipment ready to go as soon as possible. She wants us to spend the night. She doesn't want to miss it. She's afraid- Tonight? Of course tonight. We don't want to miss out if it happens again. So... you want us for another shoot, then? Uhhhh-that's the idea. Well, your people come through with the budget... You'll get paid, Tom. I'll pay you myself if I have to, but we need to get some better footage- We need better footage? We definately need something better than we have now. Ok, ok. I'll find Grover and we'll we'll be there at eight. We've got a deal. See you there. Bye. That was quick. OW-What the fuck! Rise and moan, slacker. We gotta get our shit together. Huh? We got us another job tonight. WHAT??! Weak, dogg. You're fucking with my love life now. So, will all this equipment scare off the ghost or... We just want to be ready should there be another occurrence tonight. You want it to come back? I'd like to know what we're dealing with. I'm setting up some machines that monitor the atmosphere of the room-stuff like air pressure, temperature, and humidity. Oh... A sudden change in the atmosphere of a room can indicate the presence of paranormal activity. So we can tell if something's there. That something MAY be there. Whatever. Tom doesn't think we're going to see anything tonight. He's quite the skeptic. But you think something's going to happen? I'd say there's a good chance... No... I don't want him to... We can't do this-I can't... Teresa... Teresa-Teresa-It's ok. It's ok. Nothing bad's going to happen. We're here for you. But-you-said- Ninety percent of the time nothing happens the first night of investigation. There's nothing to be afraid of. We've got it all under control. I'm sorry, Maureen- It's ok. We're all nervous... Let's start some tea and we'll sit down... Hey stupid. Huh? Tie this on the front of that rocking chair over there. Huh? What the hell is with you? You can drop the psychic act. They're in the kitchen. Psychic? The space cadet schtick. I'm still burnt from last night. How long we gotta be here, 'til? I told you this afternoon- we are stayin' the friggin' night. What? When'd you say that? There's no way I'm staying. Date? Yeah? Tough-shit. I've just about had it with you and your bullshit. You are not going to fuck this up for me. You better start playing the game otherwise you are out on your ass. You are out of everything. Asshole. Tom. It's your shift. Oh my god. What is it? Oh my god! What is it?! What is it?! I can't believe it! Oh-my-GOD. OH MY GOD! OH! OH MY GOD!!! We did it-I'm still in shock-we got it. Well, we got something. You were there. You saw it with your own eyes. Sure, I saw what's on the tape, but, you know-could be anything. Like what? I don't know. Maybe a small earthquake or a truck driving by... or... I checked-no reported earthquakes and it was five A.M. Did you hear any trucks or cars or anything on the road or in front of this house? Well... no, but- The camera stayed steady, so it wasn't the floor. I know. I know. But- The humidity gauges spiked at the exact time of the manifestation. And you saw something in that chair. The camera saw something in that chair. It even rocked like him. Rocked like him? That's how... that's how he used to rock- that exact speed. Anyway, in my expert opinion, we just may have in our hands the first fully documented manifestation in existence. If you say so. I do. Now, if you and Grover wouldn't mind, you can pack up the equipment while I make a few phone calls. Alright, Maureen. Alright. Maureen-uh, Maureen. Weird. What? Teresa keeps talking about her Pop in that rocking chair. So? So last night, before we woke up, I had this dream about some old man in that chair. What was he doing? Just staring at us. He kept looking back and forth between you and me, laughing. The President said he was just joking and very sorry for the misunderstanding. Meanwhile, in other news.. Who you gonna call? It seems that one local parapsychologist claims that she has actual video footage of the haunting of a house in the West Valley Britney Nakasumi has more on that story. Britney? This is Britney Nakasumi and I'm standing in front of Teresa Tijeras' house in the west valley, the site of an alleged haunting. Parapsychologist Dr. Maureen. Fratini claims to have video evidence of the ghost. So what's the ghost's name? I think it's a little too early to make any assumptions about that. At this point, but we're really excited about the evidence we've gathered so far in the case. Is the ghost dangerous to the neighborhood? Not at all. See, it's horror movie myths like that, that myself and the group I represent, the National Parapsychology Council. We're really tring to dispelll. We're looking for hard evidence- Like the video tape? Exactly. The video tape is really just the first step in a long process. So, you're not afraid of the ghost? Well, I don't see how I can be, given that the N.P.C.has just given me full financial backing to investigate this case and even hire a full-time staff. Tom Justman is the video documenteur who actually captured the ghost on tape and hopes to be one of those on her full-time staff. I think it's the first ghost ever recorded and that's what really thrills me, Britney. I started Justman Video about three years ago to do what I love to do: To shoot the impossible. That's what I do. That's who I am... They ain't afraid of no ghost. And what did Teresa Tijeras, the owner of the house have to say about all this? I'm not so sure about- All members of the investigation are confident that they will soon have further undeniable proof of the existence of the Spirit World by the end of the year or early next spring. Good 'ghost hunting, ' folks. So, what can you tell us about your father? Uh... well... not really that much... How old were you when your father left? Oh no. My mother and I left him. Oh, I didn't know. When did you leave him, then? My mother and I lef Baton Rouge when I was about six years old. We waited until he was drunk. Momma- my mother said that was the best way. You were both terrified of him. What my mother told me- and what I remember most of the neighborhood was scared of him. And why was that? They... they just were... I'm sorry-Could I get a glass of water? Can we stop, please? I don't get it. Get what? I was talking to her. I'm sorry? I don't get it. Why'd you take him back in? TOM- What? Look, it don't add up. If he was such a creepy bastard why'd she take him in? You don't have to answer that, Teresa. I'm just asking the obvious question! I'm sorry... He showed up on my doorstep a few months ago... He was dying... he was desperate... sick... Yes, hello? That my little Teresa? Yes, my name is Teresa Tijeras. May I help you? Don't you recognize me? You don't know your own blood? I'm sorry? It's Poppa, ma petite. I found ya. Oh... Poppa... I found ya! It's... been... years... I'm sorry. I'm sorry I drove you and your mamma away. I was such a terrible, mean man-such a fool... I don't know what to say- Don't say anything. I didn't come halfway across the country to ask for forgiveness. I came to see you... one last time... You're sick... I'm sorry-I didn't mean to trouble you... No-no... Poppa. Come in... come in and sit for a bit-it's ok... It was ok at first. We were getting along and I made sure he took all of his medications. But then he got sicker. And then he turn back into that man I knew as a child. Mean... terrible... Justman Video. He- Yes Miss Grazianni, we're all ready to go tomorrow... of course... of course... of course... yes, we'll-... yes, see you tomorrow. FUCK! ** Music** ** Love... love in the trees...** ** Love... the birds and the bees...** HEY-YOU'RE THAT GUY- THAT GHOSTBUSTER GUY. Yeah-yeah-yeah! Tom- Tom Justman of Justman Videos- JUSTMAN! What's my father paying you for? Get over here-We're cutting the cake. Yes-of course, Miss Grazianni- It's Lackner now, stupid. Come on... It was HIM... staring at me through the mist... IT WAS HIM. You've just had a good scare. It's alright, really. It's probably already faded... right? What? Yeah, it's gone, but we got the pictures. Grover's watching to see if it comes back. Why won't he just stop. Why won't he just leave me alone? You have nothing to fear from that face, Teresa. We don't even know what it means yet. Nothing to fear? Don't you understand? He's going to come back- There have been very few reliable accounts of an occupant ever being physically injured by an entity. INJURIES? You mean that there have been people who have been hurt... Boo! What the...? OHHHHH! GROSS, DUDE... Can't you get rid of it?! I WANT YOU TO GET RID OF IT! Teresa, I don't think you realize the importance of this case- I DON'T CARE-I want you to get rid of it. I thought you could help. I called you because I wanted you to get rid of it-I thought you could help, Maureen. We're doing everything we can to try and understand what's happening here- UNDERSTAND? I WANT YOU TO GET RID OF IT. Can't you do something-like in the movies-say some spell or something-like the Lord's prayer...? We're not exorcists, Teresa. I never told you we were exorcists. THEN WHAT GOOD ARE YOU?!!! I'm sorry. I must have misunderstood... I don't- I'm sorry, too. I should have explained it better to you. I forget that most people only know what they see in the movies. They only know the mumbo jumbo. Can you protect me from him...? CAN YOU PROTECT ME FROM HIM? Why are you so afraid of him? Is there something- Jesus Christ, lady, it's just the ghost of a little old man. You act like he's gonna to beat you to death or something... When I was a little girl- back in Louisiana- in Baton Rouge... before Momma and I left him... Poppa used to blindfold me... take me out to the shed when momma wasn't home... Poppa, don't-ow! Poppa? Poppa... Poppa? Poppa... Poppa... Poppa... Poppa...? POPPA!!!! I'm so sorry, Teresa. Tom had no right... For no reason at all... I was a good girl- I never did anything wrong at all... Teresa- And he never say a word to me-that was the worst thing of all... not a word... Tom didn't mean anything. He's sorry. Yeah-yeah, I'm sorry-really I didn't mean anything- It's not your fault. It's NOT your fault-I should have said something to you-I should have let you know. You have been nothing but kind to me... No-no, it's perfectly alright. This is very personal stuff. It's no one's business but you own. You only tell me what you feel comfortable talking about. I meant about today-about what scared me in the mirror. The face- No-about what I saw in the reflection. I haven't seen since I was a little girl. What...? I know... When-? I don't knowl didn't even feel it happen. I'm scared... I'm so sorry, Teresa. It is clear to me now that you are in physical danger. Somethinghas to be done. Like what? You said you didn't know how to do an exorcisms. Not like in the movies. I'm simply suggesting we hold a real seance with a real medium and see if we can contact the spirit. Sounds like the movies. I have to talk to him? I have to talk to Poppa? No, I have a person in mind- Whoah, whoah, whoah. Can't you lead us? Is there enough in the budget for another person? Don't worry, Tom. You'll get paid. Come on, Maureen-that's not what I'm talking about. I just think that we can do this. No, this is beyond my abilities as a scientist. I know a sensitive I've used before and I trust. Alright-whatever-If that's what you want to do... We'll hold it tomorrow. Why not tonight?! I can't get him that fast. You can stay with me until we can resolve this case... somehow. You can help me do some research. Thank you. Thank God. I don't know, dogg? I mean-maybe we shouldn't... What, are you dense? Her and Maureen are going to get her stuff. And then they'll leave. We'll have the whole place to ourselves. Yeah-yeah-yeah-I know-I mean... maybe something IS going on? Like what? Like the welts on her arms? We didn't do those, did we? You're worrying about the welts? Yeah-they're weird, right? She's nuts. I mean, she probably just did it to herself. I mean look... Wow. See? I told yah. That's the good tequila. She's a drunk. See, she drinks and she falls and then she falls against things and gives herself welts as she's stumbling around her precious little haunted house. That's all... I don't know. It seemed pretty bad. Were you born a sucker or you just drink until you were stupid enough? Go try the back door. I'm not going to hop that fence again? GO. What up, dogg? What in the fuck do you think you're doing? Back door was open, man. You want to spend the night in jail? No man, it's ok. Nobody saw me. Let's keep it that way. Come on. Lift it. Lift it HIGHER. Higher. HIGHER Oww! Jackass! What we gonna do with the real table? Sell it. Get some return. Buy a new toe. I said sorry. Now hold this. Don't drop this one on me. Grov-Oh, what the fuck? What the fuck? What's your problem now? Had to raid a panty drawer? Aw no. You KNOW I'll kick your ass if you've been smoking that- What the fuck?! OH SHIT, DUDE!!! Dude, did you feel that? Feel what? OK-so I was coming outta the bathroom and something brushed past me. Something that wasn't there, man. I'm not kidding. Tell me-you been in the bathroom until-? Yeah-I had to take a piss. Can we go now? Yeah... yeah-we just gotta... get the table... before the neighbors... Yeah... That was the best sleep that I've had in weeks. Thank you, Maureen. Sure. No problem. I'm sorry, everyone. The medium will be here soon. He usually sleeps during the day. Yeah, 'cause seances take place at night. That's right. Why're we having this during the day? Aren't seances-? Did you want it at night? No... I was just saying- I'm sorry. I only meant that I think people would be more comfortable if we had it during the day and a little bit more objective. Right-yeah... No parlor tricks. You don't have to worry about that. I trust this medium implicitly. What he does is no magic act, I assure you. He's the real McCoy. OK. Sorry Mo-couldn't help myself. And here I was telling everyone you were legit. Depends on the pay. More money-the more sparkle- the less legit. And how much is it today? Day's a little R and D favor for little Mo, here. We've worked together on a number of occasions. You've worked on cases like this before? Not exactly. From what Mo says, this spirit is a tad aggressive. I only had time to give him a brief rundown. What's the chicken for? You do voodoo? This kind of work makes me hungry. Takes the protein right outta me. What's going on down there? That's where Teresa's father, the one we want to contact, used to live. There's some serious mojo coming from down there. How come we're doing the seance up here and not down there? Teresa... has a hard time going into that room. I need her to be comfortable enough to focus. Ok-makes sense. And besides it's better to shoot... up here... So... we ready? Fine. Let's all relax and hold hands... How relaxed do you have to be for this? Everything is alright, Mrs. Tijeras. You're in a safe room. Everyone close your eyes and think of a safe place-think about the safest place in the world. Now just keep thinking about that safe place and we're going to hum a single note. 'Om' is pretty easy and doesn't sound too stupid. I'll start off: OMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM, OMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM, OMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM... OMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM OMMMMMMMM- **SHRILL SINGING** AAAHHHH-! Jesus! Orlando! NO, TOM, NO! GET THAT THING OUT OF HERE! TOM! Breaking news and more footage has been sent in from our ghostbusters case... A violent seance and a collapsed medium. Is this a ghostly attack? News at 11. What in the hell were you thinking? This-this-FOOTAGE. This-complete and total-EXPLOITATION. You worried about a few news spots-? Where do you get off releasing this footage to the press? How could you? Whoa. Back up there- His family saw that spot. He knew what he was doing. And that's supposed to mean what, exactly? It means I think you're being taken for a ride, 'Mo.' You son of a bitch. You don't know me, you don't know Orlando, and you don't know what you're talking about. What I know, lady, is that me and Grover've been working on this for six weeks now and we have yet to be paid. This is about the money? Is that why you pulled this stunt? You're not listing, lady. I didn't pull anything, here. I just ain't been paid- The Council was just about to send me a check, but after that news spot, I don't know if they'll even take my calls. You may have ruined our chances. UNTIL I get paid, this footage belongs to me and Justman. Video and I'll will do whatever the FUCK I want with it. You are some piece of work, Tom Justman. Don't you have ANY compassion for anyone? For who? The con artist Orlando, or drunken Teresa? I'm going away for a week or two to go to Baton Rouge for research. When I come back, I will pay you, you will hand over ALL the footage, AND WE WILL BE DONE. You gonna take that Orlando with you? You are such an asshole. Not that you'd care, but he's still in the hospital, unresponsive, and if he doesn't come out of it soon, he's going to end up in the psych-ward. Oh, WHAT-EVER. Good thing she doesn't know about the website. Justman Video- Oh-uh-it's Teresa. Is Maureen still there? No that- That Maureen has just left. Oh, I missed her. What's up? Well, I'm staying at her place, you know, until... Well, Grover is here and he wants me to go with him to my house... I- I just don't know. He says he's figured out what's going on. He says he has a plan I just don't know. Maybe Grover's on to something. Tell you what- I just don't know... Let's meet over at your place- Do you really think it's safe? Maybe we should wait for Maureen. We'll leave at the first sign of trouble. I'm sure we can handle it. Trust me. Well, maybe- Great-we'll meet at your place in about a half an hour I'm sure Grover knows what he's doing. Bye. Grover, what the fuck are you doing? Mrs. Tijeras, I think I know what caused Orlando to have his breakdown. You do? What? The ghost-I don't think it liked him. I think it prefers Grover. You mean... it's in there now? Oh yeah-the spirit is letting our young friend channel it. Oh god, no. Oh no-it's ok. He's done this before. He has? I didn't know he was a medium. Oh yes. Grover-he's got a natural ability- powers we don't like to broadcast. Maureen doesn't even know. Oh god, she's on a plane, isn't she? Maybe we should call her- NO-We can handle this without her. But he-can he...? Convince the ghost to cross over? Yeah-maybe, but we're going to need more time. No. I-I can't stay. I want out. I-I can't- It's ok. It's under control now. I'll show you. It's all right, Teresa. It's really under control now. **lt's buried in the backyard. It's** ** buried under the earth.** Oh god, he singing that record- that record that I smashed. YES-there's something buried in the backyard-something... Something the spirit wants us to see. That's it. Poppa was always in the backyard. I couldn't imagine what he was doing back there. He was burying something. There's something back there that he still wants. Yes and we have to dig- I have to-I have to- I have to-I have to- Who knew you had it in ya? Nice work. You sure pulled that out of your ass, but Bravo. And that thing about the backyard-pure genius. We're gonna have a whole shoot without Maureen and be able to spruce it up to our hearts' content. You know, she's gonna pay us double and hire us back. Here's the spare keys to the place. Do whatever with them-I don't care. I'm going to go stay at Maureen's place, ok? She said I could stay... Well... you heard her! Well, yeah but- I'm sorry. I have to go. Call me-call me when it's gone, ok? All clear. She's gone. Earth to Grover. You in there? Huh? What? She's gone. We're home free. Dude, what the fuck am I even doing here? Just shut up and listen. We have to get in the backyard and rig it and get it on tape before Maureen gets home. After that it's gravy, kid. Yeah... yeah... what are we doing? Never mind. I'll take care of it. I gotta go get some stuff. When I come back, we'll be ready for tomorrow night. Yeah... tomorrow night... What? You smoke two bowls just to get into character? No. Maybe. Dude, I don't even know what I'm doing here! Stoner. Fine-whatever works. I got some shit to do. I'll meet you back at the place later-I gotta go pick up some stuff. ** Whistling** **Music-vocals in French** What do you want? Hi, I'm Dr. Maureen Fratini and I'm writing a book on local history and I wanted to know if I could ask you a few questions. Local history? Go ahead. Oh, uh... ok. Yeah? Have you lived in this house for long? One or two years. Did a Paul Roulet used to live here? I don't talk about no Paul Roulet. You knew him? I told you, I ain't talking about no Paul Roulet. Oh... well, he's passed away, you know? Where he die at? At his daughter's house... in California. Daughter? Didn't know that some-bitch had no daughter. She bury him? Um, cremated, I think. Creamated, listen, did she put them ashes and scatter 'em on the crossroads- Or at least throw 'em in the river? Why would she do that? Ain't y'all got no sense out in California? That's what you do with a bad hoo-doo man. Witchcraft? He practiced witchcraft? Lady, if I'm guessin' right, you ain't writin' no book on local history. You're out here 'cause queer shit been goin' on. What do I do? I mean, you got him to leave-but he wasn't... Me and my brothers just took back what he stole from our momma, God rest her soul. Yes but that doesn't help me. What I need to know- He was old and he didn't have no time for no hoo-doo on us. But now that he's dead, I gotta go dig up the backyard and make sure he didn't leave nothing of himself buried here. I don't understand. I ain't got no more time for no more questions. You best go check that backyard in California. Make sure he didn't bury nothin' of his self. Out there. 'Cause if he did, that'll show 'em the way back from where the bad folk go. And I ain't have to explain where that place is, do I? What the fuck, dude? Where the fuck were you?! What-I must have dozed off, or something. What, here? Did you sleep here last night, asshole? What? What the fuck were you on yesterday? Nothing dude-I swear. God damn you, Grover. If it was worth kickin' your ass... It's cool dude, it's cool. I'll go get the rest of the stuff. Just don't freak out. FREAK-ERRR! Asshole. Where you want this stuff? Over here, genius. No so close to the camera! Hey, sorry. Think for once. Christ. I'm SORRY. I didn't get much sleep last night. Kept having these wacko dreams. Fuck your hangover, jerk. We got to dig a hole six feet deep, fill it back in, and set up a pipe system for the fog machine before sundown. What time is it? Time to fucking work, slackass. Pick up a shovel-LET'S GO!!! I think that's deep enough. Lemmie see the tape measure. Hey asshole... The fridge is stocked, bra. You already had more than enough yesterday. AWW-DUDE!! Now, get the box and bury it, fucker. I think it's about time I sit on my ass a little while. Eww. Hello-my name is Tom Justman of Justman Video and it's about midnight on November 21st in the backyard of the infamous Tijares House in Reseda. And, as you can see, there is a strange mist coming from this one patch of dirt, here. To my knowledge, there are no gas mains or sewer pipes running beneath to account for this. Our resident parapsychologist, Doctor Maureen Fratini, is out of town tonight. I could have used her here to be on hand and utilize her expert... ah... ghost handling techniques, but we can't wait. We're just going to have to investigate and take advantage of this phenomenon-do the best that we can... Grover, we're going to have to move fast. Turn off the damn camera and help me dig. 1 A.M., Pacific Standard. This is Tom Justman again and this is Grover... What's your last name? Cleveland, bra. No it's not. I'm gettin' it changed when I get some money. Anyway, this is Tom Justman again of Justman Video and we have just uncovered what appears to be a small box behind the infamous Tijeras House. The lady of the house, Miss. Teresa Tijeras, said that she observed her late father, the man we think is... uh... come back from the grave and is... active in the house- She observed the... uh... suspect, burying something-years ago-back here behind the house-OWWW! Knock it off, jerk! What, dude? I didn't do nothin'. Yeah-we'll something jus-OUCH! Something just bit my leg! What? For real? Yeah-something just really friggin' bit my leg-OWWW. Dude-get 'em off-get 'em off! GET 'EM OFF! GET "EM OFF!!!" What? I can't see-WATCH IT- STOP IT-GET 'EM OFF-AAAAAAH! Tom? TOM? T- STOP IT- STOP IT- STOP IT- STOP IT- STOP IT- UHHHH!- HHHH - stop it... Tom... Maureen... What about Maureen? She's... down... in the hole. OH FUCK-OH CHRIST, NO. She wasn't supposed to be in there... She wasn't supposed to be there... WHAT WAS SHE DOING?! Don't know. Why...? I know where there's some hard stuff. This'll help. We couldn't-a done nothing else, right? Not that I could tell. They'd never believe us... Guess not. I don't fucking believe it. Everyone thinks she's in Louisiana. SHE WAS... Wasn't she? No. GOD DAMNIT. Hey-it's going to be all right. We just gotta stay over here and watch over the body- make sure it stays hid. No... no-fuck that- Just 'till the dust settles. Just 'till we can smooth it all out. Yeah... yeah? Maybe... maybe we should. We gotta get rid of that footage, too. THE TAPE. WHERE'S THE TAPE? With the camera. We need to destroy it. NO. No. We gotta keep it. That's our ace... Ace... in the hole... That's our trump card. We gotta keep... We gotta keep... Grover? Grover? God damn it. Jesus. WHAT THE FUCK? Oh God... Fucking Grover... What the fuck? UUUGH... It's just me. Hair of the dog never tasted... Hair of the dog never tasted so good. You need to calm down. You're all worked up. They matched the bruises. Something bit me with those teeth... You hear what you're saying? They matched, damnit. That don't make no sense. There's nothing under the sink. Not even the jar's under there- nothing but that rubbing alcohol. Yeah... The one I used to wipe down the mirror so you couldn't see anything in the fog? How about that? Just shut up and fill me. My fucking nerves are all shot and my head is going to explode. I just-I just don't know what we're going to do. Gotta go. Oh, hey... Hi? You're wondering what the hell I'm doing? Uh... well... We were digging... in the backyard... and we hit a sewage pipe. So... we had to come in and take a shower and wash our clothes. But nothing's happened, right? No, uh... nothing... nothing yet... I won't be but a moment-I just came by to get up a few things and then be on my way. Ok-because, we were going to dig, in the backyard-like Grover said. And... in the backyard... Because... ummm. We were in the-nothing to-Grover's tip-you know... bad after all. Nothing back there but pipes. Have you heard anything from Dr. Fratini? Maureen? Uh... no. Should I? I don't know. But she's still in Louisiana, right? Wait, Grover is in- Well, I guess I'll get out of here and let you do your work. I never did like that girl. Maybe if we dig her up and- That's not a good idea. But what if- We can watch her here. No-they'll find her. Not if we stay here. But we can't stay here forever. As long as it takes. This place... maybe this place is cursed. Such... misery. Life is misery. Yeah. Everything just rots. Everything you do is rotten. Life is mold. It festers until it's eaten everything else. But we had something here. This was our break. It always seems that way. It always seems like things are going your way-things are finally happening. And then it's all done in an instant and you realize it was all an illusion. But in that moment, you'd do anything to forget and prolong that illusion. Maybe you need the drink. I've had my fill. But we can't just forget about it- Just try Maybe if we dig her up- No. That's not a good idea. What if- We can watch her here. No-they'll find her. Not if we stay here. But we can't stay here forever. As long as it takes. **Record player-Music in French** Turn it down. ** Record player-Music in French** TURN IT DOWN. GROVER? **Record player-Music in French** Grover? You ASSHOLE... ** Record player-Music in French** Christ man... ** Record player-Music in French** Christ, man... ** Record player-Music in French** What the... ** Record player-Music in French** Grover? Fuck this. Come on, god damnit. Come on. Damnit-come on! I'll... STAY. Oh my god... Sleep well? Where the hell have you been? Where the hell have you been going? Nowhere. I've always been right here. We gotta get the fuck outta here Grover- this place is screwing with our heads. I feel just fine. But you look a little poorly today maybe some more- NO MORE GOD DAMN BOOZE! We gotta get the fuck outta here... If we go, who will watch over the body? I don't even care anymore. You know Grover, maybe- NO. Maybe we should- NO. Maybe we should turn ourselves in. You know? It was an accident, right? They could see it was an accident, right? But you killed her-they'll see that you killed her. I didn't even see her-something was... What are you doing? The video tape. We didn't look at the video tape. I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO DESTROY THAT TAPE! Tom. Tom. That tape's not going to show us anything. I just wanna see-I gotta know what happened. FINE. If you want to see yourself kill that girl all over again, suit yourself. Does it excite you? Fuck off. You're really fucked up over all this, aren't you? The tape's just going to confirm what the cops are already going to know about you. My name is Tom Justman... of Justman Video... Murderer. Didn't do nothin' Yeah, well something just-OUCH! Something just bit my leg. Stop the tape, Tom... What? For real? Yeah-something just bit my friggin-OUCH! Dude... Get 'em off... MURDERER... that's all you are and that's all you'll ever be... GET 'EM OFF!!! Tom? TOM?! Stop it. STOP IT... Stop it... STOP IT... Stop it... STOP IT! Stop it... STOP IT!!! Don't answer that... I think I- Are you out of your mind? TOM!!! I have to... I have to confess... I can't... I said fucking, 'no.' It's the police. Do not answer that god damn door-you hear me? Get away from that door! It's about time, sleeping beauty. Look Tom, I know we've had some... communication issues, but we're all on the same team, right? We all want- Jesus, you look sick. Anyway Teresa called me, and she left me a message. She told me all about Grover and the trance and the dig. Grover...? Said something was buried in the back yard-in his trance. But... in the back yard... Tom-Tom? Did you find anything? What happened? Grover... Where is Grover? YOU... But you were in- In Louisiana-yes. I came back early. I found out some very strange-disturbing- things about Teresa's father. I don't even know if they're true. I need to know- what happened? Did you find anything in the back-? You did find something-You got it on tape? Maureen... What about me? Who are you talking to? She's... down... in the hole. I'm what?! It was an accident. I didn't mean to-I didn't mean to do that to you. Please Tom... don't... I don't know what you are, but we can't do this anymore. I can't stay here, anymore. TOM, NO. I'm so sorry. UHHH! UUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHH-HUHHHH Why, Tom? What he ever do to you? He stealin' company money? Maybe he wanted a bigger salary. He doing your girl? Maybe you were doing his girl. You kill for kicks? Do yah? Maybe you liked it. Yeah-he liked it... 'Cause he's a murderer. This piece of shit ready to see what he done? Looks like. Go on... Look -at 'em! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! NOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! NOOOOOO! NOOOOOO!
