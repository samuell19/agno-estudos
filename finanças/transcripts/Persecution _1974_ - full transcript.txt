(ominous tones) - I know she loves you more than she loves me. If I had a dog, a great big dog that nobody could carry around, I'd make him chase you away from here for good. Then she'd love me. Stupid cat! (thud) (laughs) (tense music) I'm sorry, cat. Come on, drink your milk. (cat meows and hisses) I hate you. (cat screeches) I hate you. I hate you! I hate you. (ominous tones) Mother.

(toy soldiers click and clack rhythmically) (church bells ring) (gate squeaks) (gate squeaks) (suspenseful music) Now, David. - [David] Yes, Mother. - What do you say? - Goodbye, Sheba. I'm sorry. - You will be, David. You will be. (suspenseful music) - [David] Can I go to boarding school, Mother? All the other boys are. - [Mother] Not this year, David. You'll never leave me, David. Not until I've told you everything. - [David] I've been invited to go skiing in Switzerland, Mother. - [Mother] We're going to Venice. You'll never leave me, David. Not until I've told you everything. - [David] Mother, this is Janie, I'd like to marry her. - [Mother] You can have the apartment up at the garage. You'll never leave me, David. You'll never leave me, David. Not until I've told you everything. - Alright, Mother. I can wait. - David! David! David, are you in there? (gate squeaks) (suspenseful music) David! (Sheba meows) David! David! (Sheba roars) (Sheba meows) (screams) (sobs) - Are you alright? - Yes. I was looking for you. I got lost. And then the cat jumped out on me. Oh, David, I hate this maze! - Well, why did you come in? - But I called and called and you didn't answer! - Ah, I'm sorry. (gate squeaks) Well, what do you want me for, anyway? - Well, Mrs. Deacon sent for me at the flat. She wants me to give her a hand. - Oh, why? - Mary's ill and she can't come in. It is your birthday, and we have to get things ready for the dinner party tonight. - Oh god, that means I've got to wear a suit. Why does Mother always insist that... (car starts) Where on earth is she going? - She's going to London, I think. David, you'll have to help me. There's Paulie to be fed. - He's waking up. - Will you bring him? - Yeah, sure. Nobody's gonna mess up your life. (dark orchestral music) (groans and pants) (Sheba meows) Mom! (screams) (screams) (screams) - David? - Take it away, take it away! - Now, stop crying. It's only Sheba. - Take it away! Please take it away! - You go back to sleep, like a good boy. Ah, there. (David sobs) Better? Come, Sheba. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mother. - No one. (cat roars) (cat roars) - [Mother] It's beautiful. - And dangerous. I can only stay a minute. - I'll tell you when you can leave. How's your wife? And the children. Do you know what day this is? - [Man] I should. - But you don't. - I have the money, Carrie. - [Carrie] Oh, don't be vulgar. - I can't afford any more. (Carrie chuckles) - It's your son's birthday. - How is he? - Do you really care? - Have you ever tried to care for him? - No. Why should I? - [Father] Can I get him anything? - Well, that's very generous of you. But how would you sign the card? - That's enough, Carrie. - Well, you could sign it, "From Paul Bellamy." And then David would say, "Who is Paul Bellamy?" And I would say, "He's your father." - Stop it, Carrie. - It must be terrible to be trapped. - [Paul] It is. - I understand you're being mentioned for a knighthood. - How do you know that? - Oh, it's true, then. Well, you've earned it. I would've liked to have been Lady Bellamy. - It would never have worked, Carrie. - We'll never know, will we? Do you hate me? - Yes, Carrie, I hate you. - I don't blame you. Do you know, Paul, you're the only man I've ever loved. - I hardly think that 24 years of blackmail is love. - Speaking of blackmail. We're having a quiet celebration tonight. Just myself, David and his little wife. - And a happy time will be had by all. - You're wonderful. Thank you. Today, I want you to kiss me. - No, Carrie. - Kiss me. - Goodbye, Carrie. - Au revoir, you mean. I'll see you again next month. Oh, Paul? I almost forgot. You have a grandson. - A boy? When? - Oh, eight weeks ago. - Why didn't you tell me last month? - Just slipped my mind. - What's his name? - Paul. I thought it was very appropriate. - Leave him alone, Carrie. - What're you talking about? - I know what you've done to David. Leave his baby alone. - I don't even touch it. (upbeat music) - I wish we could go out tonight, just the two of us. - Me too. - We used to have marvelous birthday parties at home. The whole family. - I bet you were happy. - It was wonderful, (chuckles) we'd play games. Charades, musical chairs... - I never had parties. - Not even when you were very young? - No, my father's disappearance did something to my mother. We never had anyone in the house, except my mother's woman friends. - [Janie] What about friends from school? - Not allowed. I was supposed to be too fragile for games or parties. Anyway, I was never forgiven for killing my mother's cat. Sheba. - You killed her cat? How? - I drowned it. In milk. - Oh, darling. That's horrible! - I hated it. - Why? - Because she loved it more than she loved me. Then she made me bury it in a coffin, as a punishment. - Oh, darling. I was lucky I was ever allowed to meet you. Let alone marry you. - Are you happy now? - I love you, David. We'll make him happy, won't we? - He'll never go through what I did, that's for sure. - David, why can't we leave here and get a place of our own? Your mother doesn't like me, you know. She doesn't even like Paulie. - I don't see how we could. I've got no job, I've never even been trained for one. What a mess I've made of things. - No, you haven't. You married me. (David chuckles) Let's have our own party, now. Happy birthday, darling. - I think we'd better get changed. You know how angry she gets when we're late. - Was dinner alright, Mrs. Masters? - It was fine. I wish you'd do something about your hair, Janie. - I'm sorry. I think I'll go and look at Paulie. - What's the matter with you? - Can't you leave her alone? - We were much happier when there was just the two of us. (suspenseful music) - Shall I bring in the cake now? - Oh, that would be absolutely lovely, Janie dear. Is that the way you would like me to treat your wife? - It would be, if you meant it. - I can't see that that matters. - No. You wouldn't. (suspenseful music) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear David ♪ ♪ Happy birth... ♪ ♪ (plates clatter) ♪ - Really, Janie, clumsy. - Sorry. - Sit down, David. - It's a beautiful cake, isn't it, David? Aren't you going to blow out the candles? - Oh, yes. (blows) - Now you won't get your wish. (suspenseful music) We'll have coffee now, Janie. - Do you mind if I go across and look at the baby again? - Why should I mind? Can't she leave that child alone for five minutes? - Why don't you let her bring him over here? - I can't stand babies. They're so helpless. I'll have a small brandy. Thank you. - And a happy time was had by all. (Carrie chuckles) - More and more, you remind me of your father. (peaceful music) - [Woman] Carrie, this is Paul Bellamy and his wife, Ellen. - How do you do, Mrs. Masters? It's been a real pleasure. Oh, excuse me. - Lovely party, Carrie. - Flirting with every man in the room. Do you think I don't see it? My wife's a dirty little whore. - [Carrie] No, don't! (Janie screams) (Janie sobs) - Suffocation, there'll have to be an inquest. - I'm obliged to record a verdict of accidental death. Accidental death, accidental death. - (sobs) My baby. - Accidental death. Accidental death. (ominous tones) (peaceful chime music) (Sheba meows) - Hello, Sheba. Would you like to come and look through this with me? (chuckles) This is our secret, isn't it? I'm playing with him the way you play with a mouse. Oh, no, Sheba, we don't tell him. Not for a while. When it's time, I'll tell him everything. Everything. I was beautiful then, wasn't I? I could dance and ride and play tennis. But that was before him. Before he was born. And this is my wedding day. You see? There I am, (chuckles) and there's Robert. First my chauffeur. Then my husband. Oh, and there he is with his polo pony. The one I bought. Doesn't he look stupid? Oh, no matter how hard he tried, he always looked like a chauffeur. He made me sick. I spent my time with Paul. (sighs) I was so happy then. - David? - Janie? - Why did you kill Sheba? Now she's killed Paul. - That was another cat. Years ago. - No. It was Sheba, you said it was Sheba. You drowned her in the milk, she drowned Paul with her fur. - Just rest, then we'll go away, she won't mind. (Janie chuckles) - She will. Don't you see? Your mother and Sheba are the same. She won't go away. You can't leave. You're still frightened of Sheba and what you did to her. That's why the maze fascinates you. You're frightened of Sheba. (Sheba meows) (ominous music) David, the cat! (whines) (sobs) My baby, my baby! My baby! - Dr. Ross, please. - That'll put her to sleep for a while. I'll arrange for a nurse to come in and look after her. She's going to need a lot of rest, you know. - Never mind, Doctor, I'll take care of everything. (upbeat music) - Another sherry. - That must be a funny scene. - What scene? - The lady with the cat. - David, go and help Miss Kalfon with her things. - Who? - Miss Kalfon. - Who is she? - [Carrie] The nurse I employed to take care of your wife. - [David] You never told me that. - I haven't seen enough of you in the last few days to discuss anything, now go and help her. - [David] Do it yourself. (door opens) - Janie, Dr. Ross felt that you needed a nurse. So I've employed Miss Kalfon. - My name is Monique Kalfon. You must not worry, we will have you well again. - Just remember, Monique is here to take care of you. So try and help her. (Sheba meows) - Oh, there you are! (suspenseful music) Miss Kalfon, this is Sheba. You know, she's a rather demanding and possessive cat. - I hate her. She killed my baby. - I think, madam, it would be better if you left us alone for a while. - Oh, naturally. But since I employed you, I wanted to introduce you. Especially after my son's show of bad manners. - [Monique] That is very kind. - Goodbye, Janie. I'll come see you again. Shortly, I hope. Come, Sheba. - I wish you could've seen my baby. He was so beautiful. - I'm sure he was lovely. (door closes) (pills clack) - Let me. Oh, I'm David Masters. Janie's husband. - Hello again. (upbeat music) (gate squeaks) Hello. I'm cold. I've been watching you go in there every day for two weeks. What do you do? - Nothing much. - You have many problems. You can come to my room for a drink whenever you like. You know where it is. Yes, madam? - I sent for you. I saw you with David in the garden. You don't seem to be getting any place with him. - I know what I'm doing. - I hope so, for the amount of money I'm paying you. - I like my job and David is very attractive. - You have beautiful legs. - Really? - Mine were beautiful once. What are you doing? - I like this bed, it's fun. - Shouldn't you go and see if Mrs. Masters wants something? - [Monique] Don't worry, madam. (dark orchestral music) - What are you doing? - Go back to bed, Janie. - Why are you burning your toys? Come to bed, darling. - Later. (toy soldiers click and clack rhythmically) - Oh, David. Why did we have to lose Paul? Do you like her? - Who? - The nurse. - She's alright. - She's pretty. - Yes, I suppose she's pretty alright. (festive orchestral music) Thank you, Deacon. - I thought I heard the car, where is Deacon? - He's putting it away. - Oh, hurry on in, it's cold. Oh! What have we got here? - It's a Christmas present. I made it especially for my mother at school. - Nice. She's got Mrs. Banks, so don't be daft, you know. Go on. Oh, don't forget to wish her a merry Christmas. (knocks) - Come in, David. Well, come in and say hello. You know Mrs. Banks, don't you? - Hello. Merry Christmas, Mrs. Banks. - What a well-behaved little boy you've grown into, David. So handsome, Carrie, so like you. - You think so? I don't. Come here, let me see. Well, I suppose he has my chin. - He's the dead image of his father. You ever hear anything from Robert, Carrie? - No. - What are you going to do with your holidays, David? - Oh, I... - Well, we usually manage to keep him occupied, don't we? Well, what have you got behind your back? Did you make something for me at school? Ah, don't be shy, I'm sure we'd like to see what it is. Well, come on. - Yes, Mother. It's an ashtray. - Oh, David. Now I won't be surprised, darling. - Unwrap it, Carrie. - Well, I really should wait until Christmas morning. - [David] You can open it now, if you want to. - Thank you. Oh, look. Sheba likes your bow, David. Ah-ah, mustn't rip David's bow. - She can have it if she likes it. - That's very nice of you. - Aren't you going to open it? - Oh my, you're impatient. Well, let's see what we have here. - Do you like it? - It's lovely. (upbeat music) (dark orchestral music) (slow footsteps approach) Hello, dear. How are you this evening? - A little better, I think. - I've been thinking, when you're better, it would be nice if you and David took a holiday. - Mrs. Masters, please take that cat out of here. - Oh, you mustn't be frightened of Sheba. She wouldn't hurt a fly. - She killed my baby. - But she didn't mean to do it, did you, Sheba? Now, where would you like to go, Italy? Or, Switzerland is lovely this time of year. Have you ever been there, Janie? - No. - Oh, I used to travel a great deal. Venice. The canals. So beautiful. I think you'd like Venice. - Where's David? - David? - Where is he? - Well, I would imagine he's over in the house. - Is Monique with him? - Oh, dear little Janie. You're so naive. Well, of course they're together. (suspenseful music) - I want David. - Now now, Janie, you mustn't do that. - I want to see David. - [Carrie] Well, he's probably in Monique's room. - No. I don't believe you. - Why should I lie? You have the right to know. Oh, would you like to go and see for yourself? - Yes. I will. - Well, you really can't blame him. Monique's a very attractive girl. - You don't look like her at all, who was your father? - Robert Masters. He was my mother's chauffeur before they were married. - They are divorced? - Don't know, she never talks about it. - I really don't understand what she's up to. - Nobody in the world ever understood my mother. That's probably why he left her. - That's her problem. - I'm sorry it came as such a shock. I thought you may have known. (suspenseful music) It's the room at the top of the stairs. (music intensifies) - David! No. No, don't come near me. - Janie. - No! Get off me! I hate you! (screams) - [David] Janie, Janie! - What happened? - I think she's dead. (ominous tones) - We won't be needing you anymore, Monique. You can leave whenever you're ready. I'll have your money for you. Everything. Everything, everything. (somber orchestral music) Everything, everything. - Yes, Mother, everything! You've destroyed everything! (dark orchestral music) I hate you! (grunts) Tell me what, Mother? - That's a hell of a way to break up a marriage. - Never mind, it's over. - Yes, but to fall down the stairs and break your neck. - I said it's over. - Look, I don't want my name brought into this mess. - I can assure you, Miss Kalfon, that having your name brought into this mess, as you call it, is the farthest thing from my mind. - You're sick, you know that, don't you? - Here's your money. It's in cash. - You're very clever, too. There's one thing I want to ask you. - Yes? - What about David? - He'll get over it. - I think you're trying to destroy him. - Would you mind closing the door as you leave? - Ciao, madam. (suspenseful music) (door closes) - If you wanted to see what was in the box, all you had to do was ask. - Stay away from me, Mother, or I'll kill you. - David, put that down. I'd have been glad to show you. At any time. (peaceful chime music) That's a picture of you, when you were five. And that's one of me, before my accident. I did everything well then. That's a picture of Robert Masters. You've never seen a photograph of him, have you? My chauffeur. Then my husband. He crippled me, David. - What happened to him? - Who? - My father. What happened to him? - He's alive and well. - I should like to meet him. - Oh, you think you should? That's your father, David. That's your father. - But, I thought... - This is the man I married, Robert Masters. That's your father. You are my own bastard son. Bastard. I wouldn't be the way I am if it hadn't been for you. He didn't want you. Nobody wanted you! No! No, don't, don't do that! That's the only one I have! No! Oh, no! David! Get away from Paul. Oh, Paul. (sobs) Oh, I'm so sorry, Paul. I'm so sorry. Didn't have a right to do this. (sobs) (sobs) David won't get away with this. He won't! No. (suspenseful music) No. He just won't. (sobs) No. (sobs) Oh, David should never have done this. (ominous tones) (gasps) (phone rings) Paul Bellamy, please. - [Man] I'm afraid he can't be disturbed, madam. - Tell him it's Carrie Masters. (suspenseful music) - [Paul] Paul Bellamy here. - I had to call you, Paul. - [Paul] I told you never to ring me at home! - I don't care. Now, listen to me. - [Paul] I'm in a meeting. - Paul, listen to me. I want you to come here, immediately. - [Paul] It's impossible, I will not! - What? If you don't come here... I swear, I'll tell every newspaper in the country. And you know what that'll mean. If you're not here within one hour, I'll finish you. One hour, Paul! (suspenseful music) David? David. David? David! - Did you call, Mother? - David. Oh. Thank heaven. - [David] Did you find your husband? - I found your father. He's driving out to see us. He should be here in a few moments. You said you wanted to meet him. - [David] You killed Robert Masters, didn't you, Mother? - Why don't we go into the living room and sit down, dear? We can wait for your father there. - Did you kill him with this? - I don't know what you're talking about, David. - Well, you buried him out in the maze. - You don't know what you're saying. - Why did you kill him? Did he find out about you and my father? - David, please. - I've got a present for you, Mother. (suspenseful music) Open it, Mother. I said, open it! Do you like it? - It's lovely. - Why did you do it? - I don't know, David. I don't know. - I loved making that ashtray for you. I loved giving it to you. I loved my wife. And I loved my baby. But you've destroyed them. The box, Mother! - I can't, David. - Come along, Mother. Come along, Mother. (ominous tones) (suspenseful music) Now, Mother. You know what to say. - Goodbye. I'm sorry. - You will be, Mother. You will be. - David? David! Where are you? - [David] Over here, Mother! - [Carrie] David! - Here I am, Mother! Mother! No, Mother, we're here! We're over here, Sheba and I. Mother! Mother, come along. (Carrie moans) (Carrie whines and sobs) (suspenseful music) (Carrie sobs) We lost you, Mother. We won't again. You can't get out now, can you, Sheba? - [Carrie] Paul should be here any minute. - Paul? - Paul Bellamy. Your father. - Robert Masters is my father. When's he coming home? He pushed you down those stairs, didn't he, Mother? - Yes, David. - Why did he do that? - Because he was crude. And vulgar. And cruel. He didn't care about me. He didn't care about the baby. He didn't... - Go on, Mother! - We had a terrible argument. (dark atmospheric music) He called me dreadful, filthy names. I couldn't bear it. - Dirty little whore. - I ran up to him. Don't leave me, Paul. - I want those letters. - [Carrie] Paul, the baby, think of the baby! - Get rid of it! - [Carrie] I love you, please, Paul. - Get out of my way! - No. No, it wasn't Paul. It was Robert. It was Robert who hit me. - Get rid of it. - Don't say that, Paul. Don't say those things. - Get rid of it. - No. Not Paul. Robert. Oh, Paul would never talk like that. - [Paul] Get out of my way! - Don't! - Get out of my way! (Carrie screams) - I didn't think about myself. I twisted around to save the baby. And I felt my leg breaking, and the pain was so terrible. But I forgive you, David. It was Paul. It was Paul. (melancholic music) He didn't even look at me. He just walked out. And then I made up my mind. And when they found me, I told them it was Robert. It couldn't have been Paul. He was too fine. He was too good to hurt me like that. Oh, I loved him. - It was Paul, wasn't it? - Robert was already dead. He found out about Paul and me. Then I killed him. I stabbed Robert with that dagger. I had to. You do see that, don't you, David? - Yes, Mother. Everything's alright now. There's just the two of us. I'll let you go in and sit down. I'll make you a cup of tea. - [Carrie] I knew you would understand. - Yes. - I love you, David. - Look after Mother. (ominous tones) (Carrie screams) (ominous tones) Mother? (Carrie gasps) - David. What have you done? - Do stop crying, Mother. Janie's dead. So, I killed Monique. I had to. You understand that, don't you, Mother? - Take her away! Please, take her away! - Don't scream, Mother, please don't scream. Cats don't scream, do they, Sheba? No, of course they don't. What is it you do? (Sheba meows) That's right. You meow. Mother? (suspenseful music) Meow like a cat. - No. No, I won't. - Oh, yes, you will, Mother. Meow. - David, please. - Mother, come along, meow! (Carrie sobs) That is not the way Sheba does it. Meow! - Meow. (sobs) (Sheba meows) - There. Did you hear that? That was quite good, wasn't it? There's a good cat. Good Sheba. Now I'm going to feed you. - What? David, please! - Come on, there's a good cat! Yes, we're gonna feed you! We're going to get some nice milk for you! Come on, there's a good cat, come on! Now we can let go of the nice cat. Now, you sit there and don't move. Find some nice milk for the cat. Here it is. - Oh, David, please. - Don't move! That's better. Here, Sheba. Come and get your milk. Come and get your milk. Come on, Sheba. No. That's not right. That's not the way cats drink. Head down, cat. - David. - Get down. (Carrie pants) Mother. I've killed the cat. (shovel digs) (dark orchestral music)
