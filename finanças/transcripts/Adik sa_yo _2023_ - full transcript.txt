How many grams? 10. 10 grams. 10? Can you pay me? The source will be paying. Count it. Fuck! Why? What's the matter? Fuck! Are you ...? Pau Paulo! Paulo! Paulo! Where do you think you're going? Sir! On the ground! Sir, wait, please! Don't resist. I already paid for it. Can't you have it refunded? How?! You should thank me, I saved you! You'd have been caught with Larry if it weren't for me! You don't get it, I needed that. Quit that! Lay off! You're acting like my mom. If I stopped looking out for you, you'd be found in a ditch! Aren't you afraid of anything? You'll either end up in jail or in the dirt! I'm more afraid of living than dying, alright? Don't say that, you're making me worry. I'm just kidding, Come on, let's just eat. Even if you're getting on my nerves. Let's go! Hey, wait for me! Addicted to You I'm not sure if I made the right decision. We don't have a choice, Pau might self-destruct if we don't help him. Hey guys! You'll like these. One more round! Hell, that's enough. Take a shot. Here I go. Whoa! You're the best, you know. Whew! I'm the best when you're drunk. Honestly, I owe you a lot. You never leave me, no matter what. Of course I won't. Where would I go? You'll always have my back, right? Promise. Promise. Now, drink up. Pau! Pau! Pau... Joy? Joy! Don't let them... Joy! Hey! Wake up! The sun is up. Mom, it's still early. [imitating gecko sounds] [imitating gecko sounds] [imitating gecko sounds] Hmmmm... Ahhhh. Ahhh... Hey! Hey! Hey you! There's a burglar! Get down there! - Get down there! - Sir, I'm not... What are you doing? - Why are you here? - I'm no thief. Do I look like a thief to you? I just want to visit my friend. You can't do that. Come here, you thief! Joy? You come here. You explain yourself here. - What's a young lady like you thinking you can be a thief? - Joy??? Come. Here. Sir, I told you, I'm not... I just want to visit my... Maria Josefina! What were you up to me this time? Mom, can you just call me Joy... Hmmmp! Mom, sorry. Sorry. You know it's prohibited. Huh? What got into your head? Mom, Pau needs me. Sis, what makes you think that? You haven't talked for two months. There's... We have this connection. One look and we know what's up. - What on earth are you talking about? - Mom, it hurts... Yeah, right. "One look" my ass. I swear you're gonna give me an aneurysm. - All you do is stress me out with all the shit you're getting into. - Relax, mom. Promise it won't happen again. It's on you... [Pau grunting in frustration] [Pau grunting in frustration] [Pau grunting in frustration] Pssst! Pssst! Pssssst! Pssssssst! How did you get in here? You're just a hallucination. Shhhh. Shhhh. Be quiet. The guard is asleep. I was able to get over the fence. Get me out of here. It's not possible. I can't stand it anymore. But this is what you need. It's you that I need. You're the only one who understands me. You knew... You are the only who loves me. I thought you were heartless. I didn't know you felt the same way. Oh, man... I'm so happy! Do you know when when I first knew that I loved you? We were still in high school. You defended me from my bullies. I felt so beautiful. I felt like a princess rescued by her knight in shining armor. Do you love me, too? Thank you, Pau. We're officially a couple now, okay? We're a couple. We're a couple. We're official now, right? Let's go. Honestly, I'm just waiting for you. I was waiting for you, too. Sir... Hey. We have a session tomorrow morning at the garden. What? Tomorrow's my day-off. I don't even have time for love anymore. Just stay there, okay? Ma'am Marian instructed me to let you know. Why can't she open it by herself? Well, it's up to you. Christ's sake. Why'd she leave without me? So weird. [Cindy squeals] O, Lord, thank you! Thank you, Lord! I've been tailing Paulo for the longest time from our high school cheering squad to staying up almost every night just to watch his band play... Lord!!! Thank you! Thank you! My work's finally paid off! Thank you, Lord! Thank you! Thank you! I can't tell what's going on in your head. If you are still thinking straight. Calm down, Mom. Don't you realize why I named you 'Joy', huh? So you'd bring joy into my life. Mom, you could have named me, Annoy. It's because I annoy you. Sis! Sis, you're just making it worse. How are you? Not okay. Why do you say that? Because I feel like I'm held prisoner here. Why do you feel that way? It feels like I'm being punished. You're not a prisoner here. I can't just leave when I want to. Mom, you talk as if you're never fallen in love. When someone is in love, the heart rules over everything. You're going to give me a heart attack. Why do you think you're here? Because... I'm an addict. It all began when I was playing in a band. We just had our tripping. Till I got hooked on it. Your mom knew about it? She's the silent type. Doesn't give a damn. What makes you say that? Since my dad left us, she detached herself from the world. From us. It was my fault. Why take the blame? I was sickly when I was young. I was useless. My dad had to go abroad to work and he left my mom. He never came back. Were you angry at your dad? Somehow. Did you look for him? No. He didn't look for me. So we're even. I'm fine with it. At least your mom took a stand. She didn't leave you. More like she didn't have a choice? Why don't you apply what you learned in school? Instead of running around with that druggie friend of yours! Mom, you got it wrong. First, he's not just a friend. Pau is officially my boyfriend. Second, he's no longer an addict. He's a recovering addict. - Sis!!! - I'm getting tired of you! - You never listen to me... - Go get some rest, mom. I'm so sick of you. Do what you want! You talk too much. Are you ready to go home? Sort of. What are your plans? None. Why? I just wanna prepare myself... to be strong with the coming struggles... One day at a time. We're live! Hello! Hello, our beloved plant-uncles, plant-aunties, and plantizens! But before we start, please share this livestream. "The more, the merrier," right? Let's begin with our budget meal... Moonshine Sansevieria. See? That's well-rooted, very fresh. Snake Plant, you can hang it around your neck. You know it! Right you are, bro. I know... I'm sexy, I'm fresh. But I think you'd better just buy one. No "Joy-miners" allowed in here. Watch it, bro. I really am going to post you. Stop that. This is just 150. Why don't you take this one so we're good? Go ahead, say "mine"! First person to say "mine" gets the snake plant... not me... the snake plant. Not Joy, but the Snake Plant. Alright, keep those comments coming. Mine, mine, go! Hey, Joy! You again? Mister! I got a text message! Emergency! Nah, that's an old trick. No. Here is the number. Joy? - Ah! Ah! (Nodding) - It's okay, mister. I took care of Paulo's request for permission to contact. He'll be out shortly. He's free to go? Not out of the facility, just out here to come see you. Pauuuuu!!! Hi! I'm here. What do you need? I need a shirt, two pairs of pants, and a set of... briefs. Brief? Brief. Ah. I ran out of... Leave it to me. Is that all? Briefs? Ah, I meant... a pair of pants, two shirts, and a... Brief. A set of briefs. Hey, that's enough. The session is about to start. I'll see you. Bye!!! Bye! See you! Girlfriend? You could say that. A girl friend. We can't be together. One pair of pants, two shirts, and one... ...brief. Oh my god, we really are lovers now. Andy hurry up! Your brother is waiting for us. What's taking you too long? Coming, mom. Come on, we're running late! We are running late. Come now! Let's go! Good morning! Where are you going? You're hilarious. I'm coming with you, of course. Really? Andy? It's okay, Mom. The girlfriend should come, too. Paulo's coming out. It's okay, don't be nervous. I'm scared that I would make a mistake. I might be the cause of... What do you call it? "Trigger"? Not at all, ma'am. What he needs at home is a calm environment. Don't give him too much pressure, huh? What he needs from you is to support him in ways that would help him. I really hope I don't do anything wrong by accident. No, you won't make any mistakes. And make sure he doesn't miss any of his follow-up sessions, okay? I'll take note of that. Hmmmp? Thank you, miss. No worries, it's going to be fine. Don't be tensed. Here he comes. Huh? Huh! Pau! Pau! I've missed you so much! Mom! Son. Son. Shh, that's enough. Are you okay now? Uhmmm... Hmmmm... Mom, let's go! Bro! Come on. Let's go. Let's get going. Come! Let's go! [Paulo Coughing] Mom, it kind of looks like... ...like a spa. Isn't it nice? Isn't it relaxing? Don't you like it? I like it, it's just... But can we tone down a bit with the scent? "Tone down"? Ah, sure. The scent is too much. Well, whatever suits you, son. Just let me know what you'd like. Okay. I'll just head to my room. Excuse me. Thank you. Oops. You need anything, son? I'll just get water. Ah, I'll get it for you! I can get it for you. No, it's okay. No. Here you go. You're thirsty? Here you are. A glass. I'll get you a glass. Stay there. It's okay, mom. Are you sure? Yeah. What about the glass? Good night, mom. Alright. I'll just tidy things up out here for the..spa. Okay, mom. Babe, have you eaten? Missent? If you need something, just let me know. I'm fine. Get some rest. Sleep well. Good night, Pa... Pa? She shortened Paulo? Andy!!! Mom! Were you able to fill up the container so when your brother takes a bath, he won't need to fetch water anymore. Yes, mom, I already did. Where the hell is Joy? We're running late. Mom! I'm here! Finally. Joy. Thank you so much. Sorry, are you sure it's no bother? Mom, no problem. Pau is also my responsibility. But... I hope you won't tell him that I asked you to keep an eye on him. He might not like it. As if we're not family. It's okay mom. I got this. Go! Okay, we'll be at the store if you need anything, okay? Just call me, okay? Yes, mom. I got this. Go! Have fun. See ya later. Okay then. He's still asleep. Let him rest and don't bother him? Leave it to me. Why do you keep calling her 'mom'? Pssst. Let it be. Let go of it. You know she's into him. We still have a lot to do Let's go. Dude, it's Larry's bro. Heard you're out of rehab. Want to score a welcome back treat? Old rate. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! What is it? It's... It's... It's Pau... What? It's Paulo, Mom! Huh? It's Paulo. What's the matter with Pau? What happened? Let's go... What's happening? Mom! Mom! Mom? Mom! What's happening? Mom... Just a few more steps. We're here. It's here. Hurry up, Mom! What happened? Mom... Oh my God. My son. What did you do? I didn't do anything, Mom. That's right, you did nothing! Weren't you supposed to watch over him? Well, 'cause I fell asleep, and then... Wait, what? You fell asleep? If you couldn't keep an eye on him, why did you volunteer? Why are you blaming me, mom? Because that was your job! How could you let this happen? Mom, relax... How could I afford to relax? Look at what happened. Remember what they said back at the rehab? Three C's. We are not in control. We can't cure this. And most importantly, mom, it's not our fault. Fault (kasalanan) doesn't start with C. It's K. "Cause", if you prefer that. Pau! Where did Pau go? Pau! Pau! Where the hell is Pao? Where is my son? Hey, mom... Joy, where'd my son go? Mom... Hello? Want some rice cake? It's freshly baked. I bought it from across street, at Ms. Zenaida. Eat some. Hang on, where were you? I was in my room. Then in the kitchen, then I went to the toilet. Here. You want some? Ahhh. Mom? Have some. Mom. It's rice cake. Mom. Rice cake. Mom... Can I come in? Sure, mom. It's just that, uh... I was thinking... I just wanted to know if... ...you needed something. I'm okay, mom. I thought that maybe... I added to your stress, that's why... you resorted to... drugs? I'm sorry, my son. Mom... What happened to me is nobody's fault. That's all on me. But... What matters to me, is that you are okay. Are you? You're okay? Mom, I'm okay. For now. You mean in some days, you won't be? I hope it doesn't happen, but... That's just how it is. There are days when... I'm fine. And days when I'm not. But I'm fighting it, that's why I need to keep busy. Okay. For now. You're going out? Relax, mom. If you're going out, may I know... Is it okay to know where you're going? The band has a gig tonight. I'll go ahead. I'll come home right away. Over there, mister. Pull over. Wait, wait. Go, go! Mister, wait for me. I'll be right back. What a hassle. Thanks, mister. Pau? Hey, wait! Pau! Pau! Pau! Pau! Did you text our order for grapes and apples? Yes, mom. Are you sure? I promise, mom. We need it by tomorrow. Yes. Everything is taken care of, Mom. Are you sure about that? - I promise, mom. - Mom! Bro. You're just in time. I'm cooking. Let's eat. Okay. How did your... gig go? What gig? It's okay. It's work. We're doing just fine? We're okay? Mom, it's hard to get stuck here at home doing nothing. And I also need to get my life back to normal. Yes, but... Mom! What's going on? I just went for a jog. Are you playing with me? I had no way of knowing who would accept my booking. Do you want me cancel it? No, let's get on with it. Give me that. Who's paying? You? Or the Recipient? It's already paid for. Band-on-the Run. And it comes with a serenade, right? Yes, but we only serenade the recipient. Not the sender. Could you sing for me instead? We have a strict policy when it comes to serenading. But if you like... You can send something to yourself... You get cuter when you get peeved. Look, you're sweating all over. I better go. Yummy! Bye! Take care! Excuse me, ma'am Cristina? I am she. You're entitled to a serenade. Would you like to hear it? No need. The package's already paid, right? Yes, ma'am. Give it here, then. Ma'am, excuse me... What is it? I need to take a photo... Payment's settled, right? I need it for proof of delivery. Hey! What so funny? Mom, it's nothing. You're such a hater, mom. Sure. I bet that's Paulo again. Mom, let me oogle at him! Nothing's wrong with feeling giddy, what's wrong is when you make a fool of yourself. Mom, stop it... I swear, I'm losing my head trying to look out for you. You're a college graduate but you're not applying yourself. You could have gone to work abroad but you blew your chances! We'll get there someday, mom. When? Why not now? Pau still needs me here. Heh. See? Nothing but a silly girl. Little fool! Oh, hey, son. Just in time. I'm still about to eat. Come join me. Let's eat. Are you eating again, mom? Have you got a worm in your tummy? Go back to the fruit stall. Go on. You go back there. Now. Mom, what happened Today's one month since you came back home. That's why I cooked your favorite: chicken curry. Here, have some. Let's eat. This is your favorite. - Favorite - Thank you Mom. Even the carrots. You especially like carrots. Eat up. Thank you. Are you tired, son? Hmmm... just got some ache on my back. Have you had your dinner, mom? Not yet. That's why I'm going to eat some of this. Pao! You're off to work? Hm? Wait, I'm coming down there. You're off to work? Mm-hm. Let's celebrate our monthsary. Okay. Game. Tonight? Sure. Okay. I can do that. Anything for you. You got it. Take care! Love you! What did you say? Huh? Love you! I don't get you. I don't get you. Hello, sir? Hello! I'm in front of your gate. 109. White gate. But your house is missing. You think I'm a scammer or something? I'm right in front of my gate, too. You're not here. Sir, it's 109 Apo Street, right? Did I get that right? Yes. What house number are you at? 109, sir. Where's the house, then? Did you look at the right number? Check the new number. I assume you can at least read one, two, three. Sir, here's your order. It's 478 pesos. You took forever to deliver! Sorry, sir. There was another house 109 on the other street. I didn't know it's an old house number. Use your common sense. You didn't see a house so you should have checked the new number. - That's why I was asking you earlier. I called... - Just take the money. Here's more. Problem? Money's all the same. Don't you dare complain. I'll rate you one star. You even got the bag wet... What the hell, lady! It's your motorcycle that's in the middle of the road! In the middle of the road? It's parked properly. Properly? It's totally off. Are you blind? Okay, sure, ma'am. Thank you. Let me help you. Please, just leave it, ma'am. I'm just trying to get through the day. Please. Don't add to my worries. Please. It's fine, you can go. I'll manage. You can go ahead, ma'am. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I really didn't see your motorcycle earlier. Then why did you make up some excuse? Well, 'cause you know... Sometimes when you hit a vehicle, they'll milk you for all its worth. I was afraid that would happen. I'm sorry. Are you being nice to me right now because, one- you hit me, two, you were rude to me, and three, and three, you just assumed I would lie to get money. I'm really sorry. You see, that day you made a delivery, my dad and I were having an argument. He's very grouchy and strict. So, sorry. Ah, so that's where you got it. What? No... That's not true. My dad used to be a happy-go-lucky kind of guy, but ever since mom passed away, everything changed. Have you been doing deliveries for very long? Not really. Not very long. I used to play in a band. Then we went on a long break. Really? Where did you go on vacation? I was in rehab. Yeah, right. Swear. Aren't you going to eat? Uh, no. I'm good with coffee. Actually, I love to partner my coffee with hopia from Echague. I've heard about that. You've heard of it? Mm-hm. Which one's your favorite? All of them. Go on and eat. Evening, mom. Have you had dinner? Yes, Ma. I'll be in my room. I'm a bit nervous. Huh? Why, Ma? You think your brother's using again? Don't think that way, Ma. What do you mean? It's better to find out early so we can nip it in the bud. [Message from Joy: Where are you?] [Are you going to finish soon?] [Pa, are you done with work yet?] Good thinking. At least you won't get dengue along with that ulcer. Hello? Hello, Joy. I wanted to apologize because I was held up at work. It's okay. Really, it's fine. You should get some rest. Okay, thanks. Bye! Good night! I love... Jeez, sis. The mosquitoes feasted on you but you still... You okay? I'm okay. That's just how it is. I should be understanding. My boyfriend's a recovering addict. Ideally, we should have waited a year before dating. But I couldn't bottle up my feelings anymore. So I have to be the one to adjust. Because if there's pressure in a relationship, there's a higher chance of relapse? I don't want to take away from his mental, physical, and emotional focus for his full and lasting recovery. Wow, somebody did her homework. Where'd you pick those up? From Google? Whoa, this is my favorite! Come in. Hey, thanks. Let me help you with that. Come inside for a bit. All right then. Who is it? One of your suitors? Pa! Papa, please stop? Sorry. Ah, sir, can I answer your question? I'm not one of your daughter's suitors. Because we just met and it wouldn't look good. I guess you could say I'm still trying to get to know her, and she's doing the same with me. When we find things we like about each other, that's when I'll try to win her. Aren't you a piece of work. You have balls. Straight to the point, principled answers. I think we're going to get along just fine. Ah, sir, just so you don't get confused or surprised, I was an addict. I just got out of rehab. Are you doing better? I'm almost there. But it hasn't been easy. Everyday is a battle, as they say. But I am fighting. I'll go ahead. I'll see him off. I'll see you out. Don't mind my dad. He means well. Be safe. I've no issue with the work, but I'm having a hard time because my mind's on something else. I want to revive the band. I want to save up money, and put up... a business. Why don't you do that? Because I know that there are plenty of users in those circles. And I don't want to deal with the awkwardness. Why don't you look for a job that you actually like? Something you're passionate about. But where you won't be tempted to use. I already got tempted... in my love life. If you get your heart broken, you think you can handle that? I don't think that sort of thing will affect my drug-use. How's your family life? It's okay. One and one fourth. How much? 75 pesos. Give it to me for 70. I buy from you almost everyday. [Joy]: Pau's so busy. I'm busy, too. Don't I get a freebie? - I already gave you a discount. - Mom. Mom. Take this. Here's your freebie. Thanks, dear! Mom, Pau's always busy. Which is it? Are you telling or asking me? Asking. I don't know why he's avoiding you. Better ask him directly. By the way, I can't visit you today. I promised Joy I'd help her with her live selling tonight. Sorry. Are you asking for permission? Maybe. Why? What are we? So you need a label? Not really. Just... just wondering. All I know is, the more time we spend with each other, the harder I'm falling for you. I'm loving everything about you. Yay! We have so many viewers. Hello, regular customers! You know what to do. You're big boys and girls now. The first miner gets the item, okay? But let me remind you, "Joy" miners are not tolerated here. I'm selling the plants, not myself. Alright, here's a Golden Legume. Look at it. Isn't she pretty? Look at those lush leaves. And they change color depending on the season. Sometimes they're green, sometimes orange, sometimes, they turn brown. That means, you haven't watered it so it's with the Lord now. It's only 380 pesos. Damn! Ms. April's a fast typer! Sold to Ms. April! Take a screenshot, okay? Five, four, three, two, one... there we have it! Okay, next! Let's go for something more affordable. Aglao red lipstick. As red as your lips as your partner makes out with you. Only 150 pesos. It already has three branches. Get now. 150. Mine, mine! Mine, mine, mine and the cutie pie at the back. Hey, lady. He's not up for grabs. Because he's already mine. He's my boyfriend. He's not a plant for sale. Mine. Hey, don't go sending him virtual kisses. If you're not going to buy, stop being annoying! He's my boyfriend. It's true! You're driving me crazy. [Commenter: Where's the proof? [Commenter: Why don't we ask cutie pie to tell us himself?] Alright, wait right there. Pau, come over here. Go on, cutie pie. Tell them. Tell them what? They don't believe you're my boyfriend. Why are you arguing with your customers? Because I'm offended! Why don't you just block them? Then you should have defended me. What did you want me to say? That we're in a relationship. Why would I say that? Why not? Because it's not true. Son? Hm? I saw the livestream. Ma, was I wrong? Would you like to get counseling? I'll set you a schedule. I don't want to depend on others. I want to fix my own problems. What about someone to talk to? Ma. Do you have anything to do with why Joy thinks we're dating? She might have mentioned something. But I didn't believe her. Why didn't you tell me? Well, 'cause you were greeting each other 'Happy Monthsary'. So I was confused. You didn't even ask? You didn't even... I respect your privacy. Don't worry, son. Next time, I'll know what to do. I won't hesitate. Next time, Ma. Please. But son, I think Joy's not that different from you. I mean with your relationship to drugs. In her case, she's addicted to you. That's not the same, Ma. Whether it be drugs or people... If it's something you can't let go, even when you know it's bad for you, and it makes you lose control, it's the same thing. It hurts so much. You thought you were both in love, and it turns out, he isn't. Ma, it's messed up. Is that normal, Ma? Is that okay? When did you guys start dating? When he was in rehab. But how did it happen? Ma, he said... he told me that I'm the only one who understands him. You're the only one who understands me. He said I'm the only one who loves him. You're the only one... who cares about me. At which part did he say he loves you and you're a couple? Ma, it's there. I'm su... I'm sure he said it... The only thing I'm sure of, is how big of a dummy you are. Pull yourself together. Cristina. Can we talk? What? I just want to explain. Don't bother explaining, Pau. Cristina. Please? We're not anything, anyway, right? Joy? Joy, it's time to eat. Come on out. Joy. Come here and join us. Joy, come eat with us. Ma, I'll come down later. I'm not hungry. What are you talking about? You haven't had anything since last night. Come out. Sis, want me to bring up your food? Just let me be. Just let me... Just let me die. Ma'am. It's all paid. I know. And I know you. I've seen you online. Can you please stop breadcrumbing girls? What's "breadcrumbing"? Whatever. You have a free song. - Would you like to hear it? - No, thanks. Just leave! Please, ma'am. If I could just see how she's doing? It won't take two seconds. She's not doing okay. She might get worse if she sees you. Ah, so-sorry, ma'am. I know you didn't mean to hurt Joy. But right now, it's best if you stayed away. If there's anything I can do to help, please let me know. All right. I'm so lucky to have you. You're always there for me. You don't leave my side. You're the only ones... that truly love me. [Message: Paulo, 'sup, man? It's Larry. Want to score? I'll give you a discount.] How have you been? Not okay, I think. What's troubling you? I know I hurt someone. And... she's my bestfriend, too. You're only human. You're allowed to make mistakes. Is it... something you guys can still iron out? Maybe. We'll get to that in time. But right now, I'm feeling... disgusted. Disgusted with myself. Why? Because even if I'm off the drugs, I'm not using anymore, but... I'm still as numb as ever. It's like nothing even changed. Aren't you... overthinking? Probably. It just doesn't seem right that I hurt someone and I'm supposed to try being okay, it's not... It shows that you're concerned about other people's feelings. You can feel things. That's scary. He's here. He's here. Your brother's here. You're home. Come join us. Let's eat. Why didn't you guys go ahead? Ugh, I'm so tired... I was busy at the store. Ma. Just tell bro that you waited for him so we could eat together. Look, you're just making things weird. He's right, Ma. I know how important your... therapy sessions are for you. But... You can talk to me, too. Okay. That looks good. Adobo. Pull out a chair. Hi, guys. Welcome to my live selling. I've missd you. Hello! Okay, you know the drill. Just type mine. Then message me your screenshot of the item. Here we have golden legume. Two pots. Aren't they pretty? Golden? Maybe you meant brown. The gold has tarnished. Lol. Is this a prank? Oh no, Joy-to-the-Plants has gone crazy. I know her. On her last live selling she said some cutie pie was her boyfriend but the guy wasn't aware Oh yeah, I remember his face. Mwahahaha... Hold on a minute! Did I ask you bitches? You keep running your damn mouths. You can't even afford my plants! Want me to smash your faces with these pots? I'm selling plants! I wasn't asking for your opinions! Are you bitches done yapping? Can we move on to the live selling? Got more shit to say, do you? - What? - Sis, sis, sis.. - Sis, that's enough. - Joy, that is enough. They think they know better, these smartasses! They're not even buying. Yes, he is my boyfriend. I'm not his girlfriend. Sorry for being a damn fool. I'm only human. Sis, that's enough. Are you going to stick around, bitches? Sis, stop it. Hey! This is not Netflix! We're taking you inside. If you're not buying, save your fucking breath! Let's just go in. Don't think you can meddle with other people's lives! Joy! That's enough, darling. Please. No, Ma! Hey. Shut up! We're very sorry. Please come back next time. Bye! - Hi. - Hi. I just wanted to apologize to you in person. Because I didn't listen to you. Apology accepted. We're good? Or... one mistake and I'm out? One mistake. One mistake. And I realize that I'm not that tough. One mistake... and I can scare you away. I think I need someone who won't run. Who won't close their doors. So... So, does this mean... I'm not the one for you? I'm not the right one for you? I just want to say that... there's still so much... I need to work through by myself before I'm ready to love fully. Hmm. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry, too. Okay. Anybody home? Who's there? How are you, ma'am? Pau, won't you help me out with Joy? What kind of help? What's the problem? I haven't got a clue either. You're the reason why she's being like this. Maybe you can help to bring her back. Okay, ma'am. I'll go to your house... Later. I'll talk to her... She's not usually home in the evenings. She goes out. She just walks around town, yelling and crying. That girl is going to self-destruct. Okay. Leave it to me. Thank you. Come on, let's go. Let's go. We're going to a different bar, okay? Leave that alone. Leave it alone. We're going somewhere else. Party isn't over. Hold it, hold it, hold it. Easy. Nice and easy. Come on, we're going to drink some more. Joy, I'm taking you home. Bro, hold it right there. I'm with her. I'll look out for her. Oh! Yuck! Gross! Watch out, girl! Sorry. Sorry? Come on. Bro, wait. She's not coming with you. I'll take her home. I'll play nice just this once. Don't drag Joy into your crap. I know what you're trying to do, motherfucker. Next time, you'll be dealing with PDEA. Okay? You've got some nerve. My bestfriend's cool, huh? Tough shit! Larry won't sell a single hit when I'm done with him. This here's my bestfriend! Woo! I'm the last schmuck he fooled. Let's go. I can go home by myself. Hey, come on. Let's go home. Hey, fuck off. You asshole. How can you get home? You're not even walking straight. Look at yourself. If you're just feeling sorry for me, just leave me alone! You're being stupid. I am stupid! Not gonna argue with that. - I'm an idiot! - What's your problem? - Happy now? - What's your problem? You! You're my problem! Why? Can you calm down? Get it together. Come on. Just leave me alone. Don't talk like that around here. Why, are you ashamed of me? You're ashamed of me? Whoo! Hey! Stop making a scene! Have you no shame? Talk about it at home. What? Take your shit home! You're being so loud! You're in the middle of the road! You're freaking useless! Just get out of here! Your mind isn't... - You're not in control... - Shut the hell up! You might do something drastic. - What, are you ashamed? - I'm not ashamed. - I don't give a shit! - Okay. Come on. You're going home. Why are you fighting out in the streets? You're disturbing the peace. I'm not ashamed. Let's go. You're going to regret this in the morning. I've always regretted what an idiot I've become. - A freaking idiot! - Okay. Ever since we were kids! I did everything for you! From making friends with that smart classmate of ours so I could copy off of their homework so I could do your homework, to listening to your music that doesn't even make sense to me! To being your matchmaker so you could be happy! And you're still not happy? You still don't love me? You still can't love me! Sorry. Pau? Pau. Hey. I've been looking all over for you. Come on, I'll take you home. Please, just leave me alone. Please, I beg you. Just leave me alone. Joy! Son? You're gonna give me a heart attack, mom. Sorry. Son, are you okay, or are you just okay? Or... not okay? I'm not... I'm not okay. Huh? Why? Because I know that... I'm the reason why someone important to me who've sacrificed so much, is hurting right now. Not just when we were still in school. Everything she's done for me. And how much she cares about me. I couldn't see it. Now I'm thinking I should stop fighting. So I'm not okay. Hey, what's wrong? What's wrong, mom? Son, never did I think of giving up. I don't want you to think that you only had Joy to love you or that she's the only one who made sacrifices. Please take him away as fast as you can. As soon as I stand up, could you please take him right that instant? Because if I hear one protest, scream out of him, I might not stand it. I might stop you. Sorry. Sorry, son, sorry. Ma, you're doing the right thing. This is the best thing for brother. Sorry, son, sorry. Son, I love you so much. - Bro! - Come in here. You can explain yourself here. Pretty desperate for a woman like you. - You belong in here! - Stop it, sir! Sir, please! - Can't have a thief running around in here. - Ouch! Ouch! Mister! I just couldn't tell you, or I guess it wasn't clear to you, because I wasn't sure of myself. I didn't want to make any mistakes. I was afraid I might push you towards.. ... the wrong path, instead of the right one. But... But son... My son, I gave you my all. I did. I gave you all that... I gave you all that I could. I gave you all that I could. I know that, Ma. I know that. I felt that. I just never knew how to... how to let you know that I appreciate everything you've done, Ma. For us, for our family. Thank you, Ma. But I feel guilty. When your father left us, I wasn't in the right place either. I acted all crazy, didn't I? So when I sobered up, I knew I had to work harder. I couldn't focus on you and your brother. What kind of mother am I? I didn't notice... Sorry... you've lost yourself. That's on me. No. No. No, son. Never blame yourself. None of this is your fault, okay? From now on, Ma, I think we need to... ... forgive ourselves. Yes, right now. Joy. Joy. Could you stop? I'm begging you, just leave me alone. Please. You know that I can't do that to you. Why not? You already did. I became an addict, okay? My brain cells got messed up. So sometimes, I fuck up. Not just sometimes. You often do. You're right about that. That's why I'm trying to fix it. You told me yourself, right? Since high school, college, until now, you're still doing everything for me. Can't you let me do the same for you? No. I fried- my brain cells but... I know in my heart that you'll never leave me. That was before. Now it's better to leave you. How can... I help you? Tell me. I'll do it. I'm not leaving until you tell me. Can you love me? Joy. I've always loved you. You know that. Not in the way you want. Fine, nevermind! That's your answer. You can't bring yourself to do it. Just leave! Please leave me alone! Remember when you said you weren't scared of dying, but living? I get it now. Back when you were an addict, you did all that you could to avoid drugs. You even went to rehab to remove it from your entire system. You're my drug. So I'm begging you... please, I don't want to see your face ever again. Hello? Hello? Joy didn't come home last night. She's not answering her phone either. Do you know where she could be? I'll look for her, ma'am. Thank you. Paulo, update me, okay? I will. [Message from Paulo] Are you with Joy? [Message from Larry] Not right now. [Don't play games with me.] [I'm not playing. I answered your question.] [Are you with Joy?] [Not yet.] [Let me have her.] [Don't make it hard for yourself. We used to have so much fun.] Fuck. Larry! Sir, postiive, sir. The subject is on his way to you. Larry! [Pau]: Joy! I dare you to run! Put your hands up! I dare you to run! Put your hands up! Wait, sir. Wait, sir. Shut your mouth. Cuff him. Get in! I know you weren't in good shape. I put a tracker on you. Thanks for saving me. Now we're even. Even? We shouldn't be counting... ...how much love friends give. You should say... You should say Couldn't you say... "lovers"? First off, you're so finicky. Second, we're not a match. That's what you think. Why, when did we ever become mates? Joy. I'm sorry for all the things I did and didn't do. Sorry. I'm sorry for being silly. I can't help it. Pau, when can you say you're not an addict anymore? That's a tough one. - Do you miss it? - No way! It's hard to say for sure, but I think, each day that you get through, every temptation that you avoid, that's something. So, we're good? Maybe. Uh, a little. Because of the Lord. So, does this mean... With the Lord's help... you could still fall in love with me? My turn to ask you. You're still more afraid of living than dying? Not anymore. That's good. Life is hard, right? But it feels damn good. Hell yes! I love you! Don't start! Friend!
