I wanted to say ... that you can influence ... not only with money The situation is ... Let's look at it. Let's take it Sorry to interrupt you. When we negotiate with an enemy Rather than a partner ... We should offer compromises and concessions. After all, that is the meaning of unity. Brother ... It's Eliran the robber ... Sit down. Hello I'm from the water company. There's a disconnection warning here. I need you to sign it. I'm not signing it. To say you've received it. I'm not signing it. What does it matter to you?

You ain't a man, You're a dog! A son of a bitch. That's what you are. You're a faggot! Hello. What's going on? Why're you here? It doesn't concern you. She hasn't paid her water bill So I've disconnected her water. This can't be an easy job, right? How much do you get for each disconnection? 11 shekels. Look, another hero has come to protect her? Reconnect her water! How much did you say you get for each disconnection? 11 shekels? Come on. Get up quietly and reconnect her water! Go! Go Eliran! Go! Kick it! Hit it! Go! Go! Good Boaz! Good! You need to be quicker. More cunning, more precise ... You need to own the goal area. Be a bit crazy.. These? Show me. Here! Reminds me of ... Look these are G-1's. They have great grips. Would you prefer Adidas? Put your hands out and see if they fit your fingers? I'll show you. Watch. Push. Are they too small? No. They fit. Give them to me for a minute. Times sure have changed. Yeah. These please. The G-1's are a great choice. 785 shekels. Sorry sir, we don't accept cheques. Why? What's the problem? We only accept credit cards or cash. Don't talk nonsense. I'll write you a post-dated cheque for the end of the month. Where are you from? I'm local, from Nahariya. Enjoy them! Thanks. Are you getting paid to guard this piece of shit? Disconnect me? You piece of shit! You're afraid to come alone huh? So you've brought reinforcements. Oh shit? Turn the water off. You'll earn another 10 shekels. Brought help huh? To disconnect me? No problem. Disconnect that and things will end badly for you. Shit, he's brought security guards. What are you looking at? Put your head down! You son of a thousand bitches! I hope your children have no water! Make sure this is your last trip, you dog! Why don't you take it? Take what? I know disconnectors who take all the pipes and the copper taps and sell them at the market. Yeah, and I know people who collect shit from cans. Members of the Court! You must have realised from the start there was no reason to suspect him but the damage is done and the good name of this innocent man has already been besmirched Even though a court case wasn't even needed. Eliran! Hello Gabi. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? I'm good. Just coming back from training. Yeah, I know. Why are you here? Boaz has new gloves already. Have you seen what they've done? They've changed everything. It's different. It's confusing. I'm not used to it. Is it better? Yes... But I'm not used to it. It's strange. How's Boaz? I think he's good. Bhoris will be there next week ... Are you worried? Are things getting to you? Yes. Don't worry. I try not to... I'm mainly worried about the army. Are you joining with Boaz? No Boaz joins in March. I join well before him. Well, that's actually better. You'll find out quicker what awaits you. Is Boaz worried? Don't you talk about it? I'm sure he's worried. He doesn't show it . I'm sure it's just as important to him. I live here. Goodbye. Bye. Eliran? Is your Mum or Dad at home? Come on in. Can you ask them to come outside for a minute? Gabi, how are you? Come on, come on, come in. Can we go stay outside for a second? I work for a firm that provides various services to city hall. Everything related to water bills and water supplies. It could be a mistake, it happens sometimes. Call the mayor's office to sort it out. I'll wait here for now. Boaz won't be picked. That Micah, is a friend of the assistant coach. He's picking the team.. He'll do everything he can to stop Boaz playing on Saturday. The boy won't be picked. Why would Micah do that? He should be ashamed of himself? These aren't normal people Naava. Can you understand what I'm talking about? I have a bad feeling. Micah is a schemer he wants to push Boaz away. His son is Eliran. Do you know the only reason he plays for the main team? His father pushed him there. Aren't you exaggerating a little? Why don't you tell me what's happened? I worked in Acre today. I saw Eliran coming home from training. and said hello. How was I to know it was their house that I had to disconnect? If only I'd been able to turn it off without anyone seeing me, everything would be fine. But they were home. I called Micah outside and explained the situation to him. I told him to call City Hall to sort things out. But he looked at me with such hatred. I told him I wouldn't disconnect him and would wait. But he didn't come back outside. I'm sure its not hate. It's just an unpleasant situation. It's hate Naava. You were only doing your job after all. Does he care about that? I know Micah. He's the kind of person who thinks he's entitled to everything. Why doesn't he pay his bill? You should have seen his house! Why doesn't he have money? I shouldn't have gone there at all. I shouldn't have talked to him. So, do they have water now? Hello? Nofar. It's Gabi. Yes. Any information about Micah's disconnection at 32 Gordon Street? Did they call? Have they paid? Listen do me a favour. Find out for me now if there's a reconnection order? Okay? Thanks. Water company. Was Eliran at training today? Sure. Did he say anything to you? What you mean? Is he still your friend? Are you still talking? We talked. What did he tell you? Nothing. What time does the game start? 9.40 Start watching, I'll be back later. Good evening. Hi. My apologies for the late visit. I've come to apologise for this whole situation. You have to understand I had no choice They'd fire me. I'm sure it's City Hall's fault. I don't think you ... I'm sure it's not about the money. I'm really ... really sorry. They had a good training session today, huh? Yes. Will Bhoris be at the game? I think so, yes. Goodnight. What a mistake. What a mistake ... An error must have happened. Sendberg gets the ball Shoots... but it's beautifully saved by Meir Kagan. A 2-2 draw. Two equally good teams. Maayan Reznik. Ben Matan. Asaf Rapoport. Lior Librovsky. Kobe Maimon. I'll get the car. Lee Keysar. I'm sorry but there won't be any more disconnections until after the election. People will still receive disconnection notifications But no further disconnections. But my entire salary is based on disconnections ... I know but it can't be helped. The Mayor's Office doesn't want to upset people. So, they play games like this. They need to look as if they are helping people So for now, we just issue notifications And leave the disconnections until after after the election. Eli I'm sorry but, you have to help me. How will I survive the next 2 months? The company will suffer as well. Are you struggling? You could ask for a loan. NO! The firm offers good interest rates and terms. NO! Here's what we're going to do. For the next 2 month's I'll find work for you here at the yard and you can also help with issuing notifications. I'll talk to Nofar. and ask her to help you register to suspend your tax payments. We'll see what's possible. How much does the registration and suspension cost? About 20 shekels It's not a lot but it will help substantially. Thanks. If the medicine agrees with her and she asks about others. Then her answers to your questions, suggest she's engaged in numerology. Dad... What happened? You fell asleep. Get up and go to bed, okay? Yes, yes, now. What are you doing? Stand up. Go to bed. It's late. Gabrielle, how are you? Zagawa, don't give him a drink. He'll turn your water off. No more disconnections before the elections, Huh Gabi? Gabi Get up. What's happened? Boaz has gone AWOL from the army. He's in his room. Get up and talk to him. Hello! Hello! Is everything okay? Don't worry. I'll be back at base tomorrow. Dad, I need money. I wasted my entire salary on nonsense. So, I'm in a tight spot. I won't have any money until next month. Right. Sleep. 410 shekels. 100... 300 ... 400 ... Go on sweetie. Do what you have to do. You're in the army now. I want to be a football player. My rucksack's in the back. Have you forgotten anything? I don't think so ... Goodbye. Bye. Hello Have you come to see Ruth? No. Is this 42 Chacedef Street? Can you come back later? No. Just give me a minute okay? A minute. I'll just tell my wife So it doesn't come as a surprise to her. A minute.
