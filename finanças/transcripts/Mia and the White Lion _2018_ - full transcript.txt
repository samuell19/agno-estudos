He hasn't learned to manage his claws yet. He has become too big. Don't play with him. As father and Kevin say: "Get up, arms out." Mom, that's fine. I've got it under control. No. If you are at eye level with him, you become his prey. Mia. Father and Kevin don't mind. All the rules. Don't you think I can them? No eye contact. Don't turn your back on. Don't let them jump up on you. It's lions you don't know. My relationship with Charlie is based on love and trust.

We are going out to eat. - Why? - You get to see that. Goodbye. - Came! You look different. - Stop. Do you have makeup on? - You look horrible. - Just leave me alone! Let's drive. - Do you remember that place? - Of course. We ate here on ours first night in South Africa. We're here tonight to celebrate - - that more money finally comes in, than watering out. - Where is it great to hear. - Now it's the right way. It wasn't easy for you to come back. Thanks. Why did we move to London? Your grandfather wasn't a good man to drive the farm. The important thing is that your mother would give Africa another chance. - Who is the world's best mother? - Mother! - The world's most amazing woman? - Mother! You, my beloved. - I didn't hear it completely. - Mother! Oh God. John. He's been released. Go in with the kids and call Kevin. - I can help. - You've done enough. It's not a pet! He is a worth the money. We need him! Taylor and Theresa come with me. In others go to the gate. Make sure it is locked. Share it. He has not reached far. Charlie! Mia! I can help you. It is dangerous. You get shock. They have put a new lock on. You can't help me. Henri! Mick ... - Come on! - What are you doing? You are so pretty. Would you just like to open for us? Impressive. Thanks, Henri! Come on. What are you waiting for? Charlie! Mother and father must not see us. Charlie. Where have you been? Has he caught anything? No, he's saved something. Mia ... Mia! What are you doing here? - Charlie ... - A swamp. He's hurt. Go back before your father sees you. And we don't play with the lions. I've found him! He is here! Came. I'll take care of him. Good boy! CHARLIE IS TWO YEARS Father has asked you to stay away from him. He would be furious. Good boy! - And then it's me who goes into therapy. - Do you want to hear music? Do you like it? He has better taste than you. Should we hear anything else? - No, oh, damn it. - Much better taste. Traitor. Mick ... Come in if you want. You can trust him. He has known you all his life. It is only dangerous, if you get scared. - Are you sure? - Of course. Just go to him. You are neither a threat nor a prey. You're part of the pack. What's happening here? Out there John, get the gun! - Mom, nothing happens. - John! - Nothing is happening. - Get out of there! Mick! Thanks. It has to stop now. I can't bear to be scared all the time. I forbid you getting near the lion. It wasn't his fault. It was yours. Pardon? What are you talking about? Mia, look at me. Mia! What's the matter? He could be dead. I've let it go too far. We must get rid of the lion. - No, I want to do anything. - No, now it's over. It is disastrous for the farm. - Thank you, Doctor. - I'll see you tomorrow. She never agrees to it. She gets completely crushed. You know that. I know. From now on, there will always be be a fence between you. That's the last chance. Don't you do as we say I'm selling Charlie. No one has to go back to him. Never ever. I love you. You must try to trust me. Now, listen. It gets better over time. You meant nothing bad. It was my fault. A beautiful day I will take you to the Timbavati Reserve. I do not know how, but it should succeed. I promise, and then you will be free. Mick. Look over here. Mick ... and Dad. How did it go? - Has something happened? - No, there was just a new doctor. - What did he say? - Not now, Mia. - Then when? - Stop it. That's my brother, but I must never know anything. - Should I feed the animals? - Go away. Things change. You don't always want it like this. When you were little you were happy and carefree. And look at me now. Panic fear, nightmare. - I'm two years older and dark-haired. - It's not your fault. - What difference does it make? - Just look at all your animals. They had been dead without you. I am 15 and do not have other friends. It's miserable. - You said that yourself. - It was stupidly said. Come on, I'll show you something. Come on. - I really want to show you something. - Fine. CHARLIE IS THREE YEARS Come on. No. You would know my secret. Here it is. Come on. You were right when you believed in the legend. It is true. Charlie is something special. Father doesn't know anything. Charlie is my best friend. I've come in here every day. A wonderful day when Charlie Being free, you might be. He must save us all. Good boy. No, Jodie! Mick, I borrow your mobile. Smile, you fools. Father doesn't know anything. Charlie is my best friend. I've come in here every day. He is sold to the first buyer. - Do not. - You don't decide what to do. - Kevin! - Yes, John. Move Charlie and get the papers. Now it is enough. Stop! It is enough. Stop. - He gets well in a zoo. - I'm not there. Excuse me, Charlie. I've destroyed everything. I find out where Dad sends you. I'll come and pick you up. I promise. I shot completely by. Frank got the anesthetic arrow in his thigh. - Well, he survived. - We laughed and laughed. Well shot. Thanks for the help. Frank is back on his feet soon. To shoot with crossbow one must have a firm grip. - What was the name? - Chuck. Now your lioness is here. Good luck! - Are you going to watch? - I don't want anything to do with it. But now you are here. Welcome back, my friend. Your white lion makes us smelly rich. I have nothing for you. I drive the lion to the farm. Tell it to yourself, so you can sleep at night. How do you think your lions was approved? My profit. Observe the agreement. Otherwise, you will lose everything. - Say when. - In two days. The white lion? In 48 hours? I hit! Is she alive? Not in the head, your idiot. Then you destroy the trophy. Nice shot. Where do lions come from? Most are tame from captivity. I've been calling you for twenty minutes. Come on. It works because you have put so much love into it. We open a restaurant with carrots on the menu. - The children can help. - Only carrots. What do you think, Mia? Are not you hungry? What is it? Mia! I'm talking to her. What is it, Mia? Father doesn't sell lions to zoos. - He sells them to hunters. - No ... All the lions that come from here, being shot in fencing. That's what we do. We don't save anything. Does not protect something. We destroy it for money. - Dad wouldn't do that. - I saw him. That's why I know. And that's legal. I saw it online. He is lying to the tourists. They just cover it. Everyone knows about it, but no one tells. - The employees are teasing or being fired. - Stop. You must hear this. You're the only one I can talk to. I don't trust father and I do not know what mother knows or believes. If I say anything and she takes his party, it's too late to save Charlie. Save him? He's the next one. - I gotta get him to Timbavati. - How? Exactly. You have to help me. Two days by car. One on the road and one off the road. - But you have no car. - If I take a father, he hears me. Then it will be five to six days on foot. - Do you think I can do it? - I think... You're crazy. But if anyone can, it's you. - What about food? - I have... Bread and cheese. Ham to Charlie. Take them here. No, you have saved them for years. Take them. You need them more. Looking for the keys for the enclosures? You must never give up your dreams. Save him. My beloved little fairy. Thanks, Jodie. Come on! Out with you. Come on. Come on. Came. We can. Let's go. John. Unbelievable. We need help. Mia's gone with the lion and we can't get out. There are cats everywhere. Hurry up. And take many with. - And Mia? - I take care of her. - I do not get it. - It's about Charlie. Waterhole. There I would go down. I'll find her. Now we got a car, Charlie. See you soon. Now. Sheep. Mia! Mia! - What are you doing? - You're leaving Charlie. - Lower the gun! - Get out of the car. I won't say it again! This is madness. What are you doing? I was there yesterday, Dad. How could you? You sell lions for slaughter and lying. Everything about you and what you do is a lie. Now, Mia. - You don't understand. - I understand everything. No. Buyers have permits. I can't control them. - But you make money on it! - They do. Not the farm. Not since your grandfather died. - Our lions are killed! - That's the way it is in South Africa. It has always been like that. - You can't change the world. - Yes, you can! Now I don't want to argue anymore. Give me the gun. Sorry, Dad. Come on. Good boy. Mick. It is me. You have to get daddy fast. He is at the Mafoue water hole. It will be OK. We can do it here. I know. Pis. I'm fine. Stay down. - Should it be filled up? - Yes. Good car. I go in and pay. It will be 554. The search continues after 14-year-old Mia Owen - - and a three-year-old white lion in the Dinokeng Reserve. The authorities appeals to the public ... - Mick, how's your dad? - He's on his way home. - Where are you? - At M31, I think. - What exit? - 19. Why? There are roadblocks in Newlands. You need to get off the highway. I can not. Stop it. Don't look at me like that! How stupid can you be? How should a teenager save you? It is impossible! We'll never manage it! You might as well kill me! Get rid of me! Kill me, you stupid lion! Do we see a star fall, so we can do it. Just a shooting star. Where the hell have you been? What about the delivery tomorrow? It does not happen. - The lion is not for sale anymore. - You gave me your word. My biggest customer comes tomorrow. Don't do it to your family. Let's drive. - I'm trying to understand it. - Me too. - John! - Not now. Everything is black or white for her. Excuse me for interrupting. It's Dirk. What happens here? Your daughter is obvious got rid of my lion. It's not your lion. And it doesn't matter to you. As long as you owe me money, It certainly makes me. Scrub away from my yard. Your farm? Fine. But now I do this in my way. Stay away from them. Stay away from my daughter! Hey. I find Mia. Kevin ... Mick, Mick! My daughter is alone with a lion, and I just have to sit and wait? I am calling. The police do that too. We go with you. That's how it is. There must be a shot at any time. Now they have permission to shoot. - What does that mean? - That you have to shoot Charlie now. Now there can't be long again. What? What? 1997? No no no. - Is everything OK? - I'm just waiting for my father. Stop it. - Do you want help? - No, mother and father are on their way. - You have one new message. - They say you have to shoot Charlie. Cut off further down too. Stop, or they'll see you! I must be crazy, But that is the only way. Mother who is a lion. You always say such crazy things. There is a lion in here! - Are they still together? - I hope not. A hungry lion attacks sooner or later. I've talked to my brother. They have been seen in China Mall. We did it! - My lion? - Your lion. Your lion! Charlie! Charlie! - We'll find her. I promise. - There's something you don't tell. I know. We have to get some sleep. Where have you been? Charlie, wait for me. Get off. They will kill you! Where is he? Where is it! Where's my white lion! Kill him! Shoot the lion! Shoot him! Shoot the lion! Come on! Before hell! Well, Charlie. Now we go. Let's go. Stay with Mick. You should stay away! - Your white lion attacked me. - Where's my daughter? - I do not know. - If anything happened, I will kill you! Get lost! I don't want to see you again. You can just try to take the farm. Mia, where are you? Mia! Mia! What the hell happened there? John! - Then tell her. - It's not about you! You've done everything right, I know. It's Dirk's fault. South Africa. - Say it now! - What? What? Mia watched a hunt. I didn't know anything. He had a permission. I didn't ask. - You promised! - I've done everything. How? After that, it cost us the last time. - And now we can lose Mia! - Mom, Dad! It's alright! Charlie protects Mia, until they reach the Timbavati reserve. - Timbavati? - Yes! Mia delivers Charlie to the Shangaan people. Wait, Charlie. Timbavati reserve. Between Kudu and Mount Sheba. - Did everyone hear that? - We drive to Timbavati. Mick. We go with you. - Alice ... - Forget it. Wait, Charlie! It was supposed to stick together. Give me a chance! I was very in love, very naive - -and waited for Mia. And you were ... ... a happy little boy. We made lunch for the guests. One day Dad had forgotten something on the kitchen table - - So we drove after him. When we got to the enclosure ... ... the hunt had started. And they killed the beautiful lion ... Without reason. With crossbow. And you saw it all. It was so terrible. We got into the car again. Deeply shocked. Your whole little body shook, as if you froze. And I said nothing. I could not. Pardon. That was why, we moved to London. Then Dad came back to us, and I forgave him. Then followed ... ... ten happy years. Wait. It doesn't matter, Mom. It does not matter. Mia takes Charlie to Timbavati, and then everything is up to date. The legend comes true. We are rescued and everything is going well. She's alive. She is at the entrance to Timbavati. Kevin. Let's drive. We did it, Charlie. I have no strength left. But you're going over that river. Then you are free. The lion. It has come back. It will be OK. It is joyful tears. Hurry, Charlie! Hurry up! Hurry to the bridge! To the bridge! Wait! Stop! Don't touch Charlie! He doesn't hurt her. - Do I have to shoot? - Aim! You were right! - You can change the world! - Sheep... Please save him! Do not shoot! Please save him! Protect him, Dad! What is he doing?! Do not shoot. Don't worry, Charlie. You should do it. Mother! Do not shoot! I must not shoot now. He's in the reserve. A hundred years ago there 250,000 wild lions in Africa. The number has decreased by 90% and last year there were under 20,000. Lions are not considered to be an endangered species - - but with this speed they risk to disappear from nature in 20 years. For ten years, 10,000 lions are in South Africa was hunted legally in fenced areas. They are raised on farms that are fooling volunteers and lie to tourists.
